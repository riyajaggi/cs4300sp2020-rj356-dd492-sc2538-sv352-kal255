 A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES MARIO: Watch how he tears him apart, vicious son of a bitch. Did you see Andy? DIOS: Who's Andy? Your nephew, Osvaldo's youngest son. Oh, yeah. MARIO: He's about five or six and it seems his mother is raising him like a pussy because she doesn't want him to become a good-for-nothing like Osvaldo. So what if he turns out like his old man? How long has Osvaldo been in jail now?

 I don't know. Gladys said he's a savage. He likes programs where animals devour other animals. I don't like those shows. MARIO: But he loves them. When his mother isn't looking, he changes the channel to watch those programs. He's some little bastard! (LAUGHS) Listen... I'm going to replace Pastor in the patio. I knew it! I was the one to suggest assigning that job to my friend, but because he's not friends with Yame... That's not why, don't get worked up.

 Pastor doesn't care about the patio, he's not interested in sales and he doesn't want to work there. Don't you realize that? Those pieces of shit made a mess of things but what's done is done. I don't like Pastor! Get it? I don't like his arrogance. I don't trust him. You don't know him, that's why you don't trust him. You don't want to get to know him either. I don't owe him anything, why should I suck up to him? He should be making an effort to get to know me and show some respect. That's fine, Marito. Why don't you go find another Morcilla? That's what you need, another flunky to kiss your ass! You could have escaped but you didn't. You came back, you were true to your word. But I don't trust anyone, and when someone keeps their promise, I think to myself, "He wants to fuck me. He's up to something." Emma, come. Are you leaving? Yes, that was enough for today. ANTIN: I want to ask you something. What? Tell me. Based on your vast experience with prisoners, isn't it true that when an inmate leaves prison, he wants to escape, never to return again? In the majority of cases, yes. But some are afraid of leaving. See? Are you okay? Yes, everything is fine. How are you, Triste? Don't strain yourself, put him to work. (CHUCKLING) Did you see Emma's face? She looked bad. If what my brother said is true, now she's starting to show symptoms like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea. Are you an idiot? What? Pregnant women don't have diarrhea. You don't know anything about women. Haven't you ever been with a chick? Why do you think they call me "Blue"? Excuse me, have you seen Mrs. Molinari? She left. I see. Pastor is too good to you. MARIO: Why do you defend Pastor so much? Does he fuck you? Do you fuck him? Which is it? Go to hell! I'm not saying you need to stop. Listen to me! I told you a thousand times, don't walk away when I'm talking to you! You son of a bitch! She's the same bitch that gave birth to you. Fucking idiot. ANTIN: What's going on here? (LAUGHS) What's going on? Is there a problem? If you came to fight, you picked the wrong day. You want to fight? No, I come in peace, Mario. You came at the right time then. Come, sit down. They brought me this salami, it's a delicacy. You should try some. (CHUCKLES) DIOS: Come on, hurry up. We're going to be here all day. Stop splashing me! What do you think you're doing? Can't you see I'm standing here? INMATE 1: Motherfucker, this water is shit. It's making me lose my hair. There's more acid each time. I don't know what's going on. Those bastards are clogging up the pipes. No, it's Sandro. (LAUGHS) INMATE 2: Why don't you ask jail authorities to get you a hair transplant? That would be awesome. DIOS: What's taking you so long down there? INMATE 3: This is the last time I'm doing this. Stop throwing my things around! Did you lose something? Are you talking to me? Yes. It's none of your business. Why don't you tell me so that I can help you? Yeah? Yes, piece of... Stop! Pastor! Are you crazy? You can't even defend yourself, you piece of shit. What's wrong with you? He's a friend. Whose friend? Ours, a friend of the gang. Motherfucker. Go on. Now I know your face. Come on, Pastor! Stop! What are you doing? Calm down. What's wrong with you? What are you looking at? So you came down to see what hell is like, is that it? I'm in hell, Mario! I don't have a home, my woman doesn't care about me. She doesn't let me into the house. I sleep in the office, all twisted and bent out of shape, in a chair. I'm fucked. If this isn't about making your rounds to check up on your wild prisoners, then why the fuck did you come? I had a serious problem and I wanted to thank you for reconnecting the monitors. You did well. I just did my job. You disconnected them in the first place, it was the least you could do to repair your damage. I'd like to invite you to dinner as a sign of my appreciation. To your office? No, to Puerto Madero, idiot. Where do you think? We can't go to Puerto Madero because we have a problem. What? Oh, now I remember. You're a prisoner, idiot. (LAUGHS) You're a prisoner too, Antin. Yes, but I can leave whenever I want. (LAUGHS) Are you inviting me to your office because you want to beat me up again? Or are you inviting me so that I can beat you again? What? Are you going to punch me on the nose? No, when I'm really mad at a friend I like to beat the shit out of him, get it all out. Right. Clean slate, Mario. Everything is fine. Good, we're friends again. Sushi? No! Raw fish is for fags. They brought me sushi the other day and I almost choked on the chopsticks. If you want to make it up to me, bring me a nice thick steak and I'll be happy! All right, a nice steak. I'll bring the wine. I have a Malbec that's over 1,000 pesos. When you try it you'll have multiple orgasms. No, thank you. Multiple orgasms next to you isn't pleasant. Stop fucking around. Speaking of multiple orgasms... The other day, when we conducted a search and confiscated some of your things, the guys found a cell phone. That's a violation of privacy. No. They were doing a routine search. And they found some very interesting things. What? Tits, ass, cunts, clits. Those sons of bitches! They were jacking off while looking at pictures of my wife. (LAUGHS) No. They weren't jacking off and this wasn't your wife. Don't be an idiot. How do you know? You can't see her face. You can see her tits and those aren't your wife's. This chick is hot, your wife is a dog. And this slut is from here. You're fucking a chick from here, one of ours. In one of the pictures you can see the change rooms in the background. I'm telling you, it's my wife. If you don't believe me, that's your problem. You're trying to be a gentleman. You steal my phone and I need to explain myself to you? Stop busting my balls. You want to protect the slut, but it's not going to work because I'm going to find her. You know that when I look for something I find it. All right? Is dinner still on? Yes, I'll send my limousine at 8:00 p.m. Send the red one. (ANTIN LAUGHING) (RINGING) Arias Clinic, good evening. EMMA: Good evening. I'd like to inquire about a patient, Elida Garibaldi. The helpline is open from 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Who's calling? I'm a neighbor. I found out about her son. I wanted to know how she was doing. What did you say your name was? How is she doing? Give me your number, one of our clinicians will get back to you. I can't give you more information. Yes, my number is four... Hello? (DIAL TONE) (KNOCK ON DOOR) Who is it? GASTON: It's me. What do you want, Gaston? GASTON: I have my keys, can I come in? No, I don't want you to come in. I want you to leave. (EXHALES) Open the door. I need to talk to you and return your keys. I want you to leave, Gaston. I was about to go to bed. Emma, please. Open the door. Enough! I feel bad. Open the door! I don't care if you feel bad. Leave! Open the door! Open the door! Have you lost your mind? Who are you with? EMMA: I'm not with anyone. What's wrong with you? What do you want? I want to know how you're doing. How are you? Give me the keys? How are you? What do you think? Because of what happened today? Emma, it was stupid, it didn't mean anything. It was stupid of me. Stupid? I made a mistake. It was stupid. Yeah. Can you give me my house keys? Because we were arguing. Arguing? Yes. Honestly, I wish I had an explanation but I don't. I'm stressed, Emma. I'm... I'm just under so much pressure with this audit. I don't care. I want you to finish the audit and go to hell. Go fuck your colleagues from work. Why do you say that? I want you to leave! I don't want you to fuck around anymore. I love you! I miss you! You've got some nerve. Why do you say that? You're disgusting. What are you saying? I want you to leave my house. Please go. That's enough. Go. We'll talk another day. (DOOR CLOSES) Did you fix things with the big guy? Yes, everything's fine. We paid them in powder, they'll have enough drugs for a few days. It's all good. Did they just give him a beating or did they fuck him up as well? They fucked him up all right, they made a real pussy out of him. They're all scared shitless now. Big Arevalo is fine. But Gusano is an idiot. During the fight, he lost a medal with his initials. Maybe the idiot left it as a souvenir to mark the occasion of his first beating. (LAUGHS) We need to watch those guys. We don't know what they're going to do. They're not going to do anything. They know the rules. When you hit someone high up, the lower ranks get hit twice as hard. They're not morons. When I came here, many years ago, they broke your ass. It was their way of welcoming you. If you didn't stand up for yourself, they fucked you up. And if you were good-looking, you wouldn't make it to the cell a virgin. The guards would beat you up. They didn't do that to you, did they? Do I look like a broken ass? You're not a virgin because you're macho, it's because you're ugly. Have you looked at yourself in the mirror, pretty boy? Let's stay alert over the next few days, we need to stick together and have friendly guards around as backup. Did you hear me, birdbrain? GUARD: Mario. Your wife is here. I'm coming. Can you guys leave me alone for a bit? I need to make a call. (SNORTING) You're a son of a bitch! You too, go. Stand guard. I don't want them spying on me. Go on. Excuse me, ma'am? Ma'am? Yes? Who are you looking for? My grandma, she's in room 17. Name? Sara. One second. Sara. Yes, down the hall to the left. Thanks. Not a problem. Go on. I'll speak to the family. Excuse me, are you a relative? Um... Are you a relative of Mr. Hector? Hector? No. Who are you looking for? Elida. Elida? Follow me. Here she is. Elida? Elida, you have a visitor. Elida. It's Emma, your daughter-in-law. (ALL CHEERING) I was just in the dining room. Everything's fine. No one knows anything yet. (INDISTINCT TALKING) What's up? How's it going? What's with the paunch? Come on, show some respect! Are you celebrating? We're preparing a surprise for Borges. What are you up to? You'll see. All right. And you? What are you doing with that? I'm leaving. I asked for a transfer. I'm going to General Pinto. Why? To be closer to my family. San Onofre is far away from home. I'll be closer to them there. We'll miss you, won't we? INMATE: Yes, we'll miss you. I won't. (CHUCKLES) Some friend you are! Take care of yourself. Don't fuck things up. Stay alert. Don't move into my cell. They're sending someone else, I was exchanged. See you around. He thinks we're his servants! (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) (FIRECRACKERS BURSTING) (ALL CHEERING) ♪ We rule this cell block We're tired of all this repression ♪ (FIRECRACKERS BURSTING IN DISTANCE) (GLADYS CHUCKLING) GLADYS: How are you? Good. (MOANS) How are you? (SIGHS) Fine, and you? I'm surviving. What was all that outside? Fireworks in the courtyard. Why? What are they celebrating? I don't have a fucking clue. It's calmed down now. It sounded like a riot. I don't understand how they let fireworks in here. It's terrible, authorities have no control. Gladys, you smuggled in a plasma TV. That's different, that's entertainment, it doesn't hurt anyone, Mario. Here, count it, I just grabbed it quickly. It's all there. And? How's Diosito? Is he back with the psychologist? Yes. Yes, things are back to normal. He busts my balls every day. (LAUGHS) I don't know whether I should be happy to have him around or not. You can't imagine the girl we brought him. (CELL PHONE RINGING) They were at it even in the car. And Claudia? She seems so modest. But it turns out she's a slut. She's telling everyone. The bitch is bragging about it! Yes? Yes, it's me. My brother-in-law? MAN: They found him dead this morning. The first thing I noticed were knife wounds... They electrocuted him. We need your wife, or a close relative to come to the morgue. Uh-huh. It seems to be a gang retaliation. They left a message to claim responsibility for the death. I suppose so. GLADYS: What do you mean they killed Osvaldo? Is this some kind of a joke? What the fuck is this? Who the fuck called you? This can't be. The director of the Torcuato penitentiary. He knew we were related. But why? Why did they kill him? I don't know, sweetheart. This happens in jail, it's common. What do you want me to do? But he never bothered or hurt anyone. He wasn't like you or Diosito, you're fighters, but he wasn't like that at all. He must have crossed some son of a bitch. I don't know. The quiet ones have the hardest time here. You know that. Listen to me, Mario. I want you to find out who killed my brother. I want you to find out and I want you to give them what they deserve. Do you hear me? Did you hear me or not? Calm down. Just relax. Calm down. (SOBS) He was good. You know? Everything all right? More or less. Not great. I'm fighting with Marito because of you. I'm not saying it's your fault but it's because of you. I guess you can't control other people, right? Yeah. The problem is he's taking it out on me. I'm in the middle and that's what's pissing me off. You're both the same, neither one of you ever tries to help the other. Make an effort, my friend. Like I do. They want to split us up and we can't let that happen. What do you mean? DIOS: We can't let them split us up, we can't let them destroy our friendship. We can't let anyone come between us. Do you understand? Everything is fine. I'm cool. You don't have to ask your brother's permission for everything. He thinks you're siding with the other gang. That's why he doesn't want you in the courtyard anymore or anything. He can go and fuck himself. Your brother wants me to take their money. I don't want to do that. Do you understand? Tell him that. Hold on. One thing. Did you tell anyone about what happened the other day? The little party we had, remember? What? What happened between the two of us, when we were drunk. What? No I didn't say anything. Nothing happened between us. Are you talking about when you kissed me? You threw yourself at me and kissed me. I didn't do anything. Do you understand that? I was really high, I was out of it, really fucked up. Understand? Yes, but I don't want you to think I'm gay. No, it's fine. Don't worry about it. I don't want you to think of me like that. It's fine. And don't worry about the problem with your brother, it's fine. I'll take care of it. The way I see it, there are two gangs. And there's like this crack in the middle. What we need to do is try to stay out of that crack. What crack? For our love. What? What the fuck are you doing? It was a joke. A joke? I was just joking. It's not funny. Next time, I'll kill you. Where's your sense of humor, my friend? Friend? Stop! I'm not your friend. What are you doing? What's wrong with you? What do you want with me? Nothing's wrong. See what I'm saying? Every time we get close, something gets in the way. It's the crack... Like the crack in your ass, idiot! If you're a fag and trying to get with me, forget it! Not with me! What? Me a fag? Fucking cunt! If you're in a bad mood, we'll talk later. How are you? Good? Excuse me, one minute. Elida, I'm going to steal your visitor for a minute and I'll bring her back. Come with me, please. Okay. I'll be right back. Excuse me, but... Whose wife are you? Miguel's. Well, we're not married, but we've been together for a long time. We've been looking to find one of Elida's relatives for a long time and we haven't found anyone. We don't live in the country. We're here to take care of some business for my brother-in-law and I wanted to visit Elida to see how she's doing. She's not too bad. Her sickness helps her endure the pain. She sometimes has moments of lucidity, the poor woman. Do you know anything about the boy? Watch what you say, Elida doesn't know he's missing. Don't worry. No, we don't know anything. We're very worried. So she's still lucid? Yes. She has her moments, but they're shorter each time. Can I take her for a walk? Yes, of course. She loves going for walks. Go on. Thank you. Excuse me. Elida. It's Emma, Miguel's wife. Miguel, your son. Little Miguel? Do you want to go for a walk in the park? Have you heard of Judge Lunati? The one that was killed? The judge? Yes. That was horrible, he was so viciously attacked! His daughter made a statement. What's her testimony? She swears that she was kidnapped and held in San Onofre by Borges' gang. (LAUGHING) That's funny. Honestly, that's very funny. It sounded ridiculous to me too and so I looked at your visitors' log. Yes? Yes. It turns out that Judge Lunati was here, in this prison on November 23rd, the date of his daughter's kidnapping. I don't understand. What does that have to do with anything? There's nothing unusual about a criminal judge visiting a prison. What's interesting is that he visited Borges. That's preposterous, it's absolutely impossible. I know everything that goes on here in San Onofre, nothing escapes me in this prison. I'm on top of everything here. You can see for yourself. I've got cameras everywhere. This is Big Brother without a script, and I manage the whole thing. I know everything that goes on here. Besides, consider this, Doctor. If a judge's son or daughter is kidnapped in a prison, think about this, his own child! Is he going to come and visit? No! He'd come with a search order, with the Special Forces, he'd kick everyone's ass, lock everyone up and rescue his child. Yes. We don't know if the judge knew that his daughter was kidnapped here, but she provided details of being held captive in a cell. What details? Yes, she shared details of speaking to a few inmates. But she's unable to specify exactly where she was held. It's impossible. It's totally ridiculous. It's absurd. (FIRECRACKERS BURSTING) (INMATES CHEERING) Fucking cunt! Son of a bitch! Come here, piece of shit! Motherfucker! What's wrong? Come here if you have the balls, fucking cunt. CESAR: Is the noise bothering you? I'm going to kill you, motherfucker! You went for my family, son of a bitch! I'm going to kill you! Fucking cunt! I'm going to kill you! Son of a bitch! Piece of shit! You went after my family, son of a bitch! You don't follow the code, you're a piece of shit. What code? You broke it first. What's wrong? Does your ass hurt? Does your ass hurt? Did you tell the guys that they broke your ass? And you enjoyed it? Fag. Broken ass! What are you going to do with him? Will you mourn him or eat him in a sandwich? I'm going to set this courtyard on fire with all of you fuckers inside. Blah, blah... You're stuck in here, too. The fire will be so hot, you'll all be charred and black as coal. I'm going to set those sons of bitches on fire. As I always say, our prison here is like a pressure cooker. If you don't pay attention to the internal temperature, if you don't manage it, it'll blow up in your face and you'll have shit everywhere. I don't know why this happened. Was there a fight in the dining room? I don't know. I think Rico would know. Right, Rico? No, I don't know. You never know anything. But a little bird told me that the attack started in the showers, and the person responsible for monitoring the showers is you. No, I didn't see anything. Nothing? You never see anything. (CHUCKLES) It doesn't matter. Starting tomorrow, we'll tighten security and controls in San Onofre. We'll focus special attention on the Borges guys because they're always involved in some way. We'll conduct searches almost every day and more thorough searches of the common areas. The courtyard, the dining room... We'll have to work extra hours and get paid... You're not getting paid for anything, you're suspended. I have nothing to do with this! It's in your file, don't play dumb with me. I know very well that you cleared the zone, it's a common practice in jails. Boys, that's it for today. You, stay. I want to talk to you. ELIDA: He was very handsome. EMMA: He was a very sweet boy. (EMMA CHUCKLING) ELIDA: He's handsome here, too, when he's older. What was his father like? A very good guy. He also worked as a police officer. But at some point he... He started to drink, a lot. And one day he left. We didn't know how... How to fix the family. We couldn't. It forced Miguel to grow up too quickly. That's what happened. Let's talk about something nice. Let's change the topic, okay? Yes, of course. Forgive me for asking, but are you pregnant? (BOTH LAUGHING) Did I just say something wrong? I'm sorry. No, you didn't. Isn't that wonderful? But I don't want to lie to you. The baby isn't Miguel's. Ah. Well, it doesn't matter. As long as you're a happy mother. Thank you. Rico, why do you have to argue with me in front of others? I'm doing you a favor. Don't you realize that if I don't fire you, you're going to die? Is my file also a favor? If you tell me who was involved, I'll go easier on you. Okay? Think about it. I know you'll think about it. Mario! Dear Mario, I'm sorry. I heard, they called me from Don Torcuato penitentiary. It's fucked up. The guys in Sub-21 are responsible. Yes. I've been telling you to stop them. Don't underestimate them. You have to give them some space. I need you to grant me special leave. I need to attend the wake with my wife and take care of my family's security. A leave? Yes, this isn't a hotel. Yes, I need to go home. I can't right now, that won't be possible. But you let any idiot leave. I never let just anyone leave. And when I do it's because... I thought you were the boss around here, not some flunky. What do I have to do? Go through my lawyer and a judge? Yes. For once, do things the right way. Just say, "Mr. Judge, my name is Mario Borges..." They'll give you your leave and that's it. Don't you realize that things are fucked up? What are you talking about, Antin? The girl, Lunati's daughter testified claiming that you kidnapped her and held her here. Your neighbors went too far. What do you want? Stop it. Don't come so close. What? What's wrong with you? What do you want? Those faggots killed Marito's brother-in-law. Did you hear about it? No, I didn't know. Send my condolences. Some guys from Sub-21 did it, they have people over there. They went too far this time. This means war, Pastor. So? I want to know whose side you're on. I'm on my side, I'm independent. There's no such thing as independence. Really? Not in this place, there are two gangs here fighting against each other. I'm in one of them. And you? Me what? Like my brother says, you never know with you. Don't you trust me? Weren't we friends? You're listening to other people's nonsense. You said we'd always be friends, no matter what. Isn't that right? Mario's going to be seriously pissed off. I don't care about Marito. I have nothing to do with your brother or with the guys. Do you get it? Okay. I just wanted to know which side you were on. Okay. So I know whether or not to defend you. Now you know which side I'm on. Okay. You can think for yourself, you're not your brother's puppet. You're a big boy now, aren't you? I'm going to the courtyard. Everything's fine, we're good. Hi. Hello. How are you? What's up? I have news for you. Come see me later, okay? Sure. Okay. Do you have a cigarette? Here. Hello. You're late today. Yes, I had errands to run. Is everything okay here? I thought you were mad. Mad? Why? Because of the awkward situation, because I got carried away, you saw us. You must think I'm some kind of hussy, I feel awful. No, it's fine. Don't worry. He got really upset when he saw you. I wouldn't know. Are you here for long? I need to conduct a few interviews here. No, I was leaving. Everything is fine then. Yes, don't be paranoid. Go on. No. Take care. You too. Pastor! Come in. Close the door. Come, sit down. I visited your mom. Seriously? Yes, she's doing well. Look. Here. (EMMA LAUGHING) (CHUCKLES) Did you talk to her? Was she able to engage in conversation? Yes. Could you speak with her? Yes, I spoke with the therapist. She said that some times, she's fully present and some times, not. But with me, she was engaged the whole time. We talked a lot and had lunch together. She showed me pictures. She told me things about you. Who did you say you were? Your wife. I'm sorry, I couldn't think of anything else. No, that's fine. (SIGHS) Thank you so much, it means a lot to me to know that my mother is fine and that somebody went to see her, while I'm in here. Yes, of course. It's important to me. And the boy? Did she say anything about Lucas? No, she doesn't know anything. She doesn't even know he's missing. It's better that way. Yes. Look at her smile. The place is very nice. She looks really well. Thanks again, I really appreciate it. You're welcome. INMATE 1: Where are the rest of the girls? INMATE 2: Even the gunman is acting like a pussy. INMATE 3: You're so funny. I know you like to play with a gun. INMATE 1: Go on. I'll remember you said that. I won't forget either. INMATE 2: Where are you taking us? Relax. You haven't done it here yet. What did you want? To fuck in the stairwell? I don't like any of this. I don't like this. Relax. It's the old part. No one can hear us here. We can do whatever we... What? Why are you looking at me? See? It's quiet here. No one can hear us. (CLEARS THROAT) How sweet. Look at him suck your cock. What are you doing here? What are you doing? I've got a good memory. Don't you remember what you did to me two years ago? But you liked it, fag. We had nothing to do with that. Stop it. They sent us. Close your ass, fag. Enough! CESAR: Stop it. What's wrong with you? So you're the kingpin around here? You like it when they suck your cock? Stop. You're the biggest prick of them all. Do you remember me? Get on your knees, asshole. Calm down, it wasn't me. Get on your knees and apologize! Stop. Apologize! Come on, motherfucker, get on your knees. Apologize! Tell me you're sorry! I'm sorry! Motherfucker! (ALL SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY) (SCREAMING) Come on! Come on! Let's go! Get it! Come on! Go on! Let's go! (CLAPPING) You think that if we gain a foothold in Borges' sector, prisoners from the other wings will be on our side? I think so. I doubt anyone will abandon Borges' gang. But you need support from inside. We have to be smart about it or else we'll be carrying out dead bodies alone. I don't want any more fights. I've done my share. What did you do to those guys? What we needed to do. We buried them all, except one. Except one? What did you do? You'll find out. Look. PASTOR: What are they doing over there? That's a passage that connects to the old jail. They're covering it up to keep it hidden. Then we can come and go as we please. How are you, sweetheart? Be strong. The guys who did this, I promise the sons of bitches are going to pay. Yes. Listen to me. Put the phone on speaker and put it somewhere where everyone can hear me. Ready? GLADYS ON SPEAKER: Okay. We can all hear you. Hello, friends. Family, brothers. Thank you for your support during this difficult time. From the bottom of my heart, I thank you. I'd like to be there with you but... They didn't let me leave. We're going to miss him, we loved him a lot. Osvaldo was my brother-in-law, but... He was like my brother. I'm going to repeat what I said to Gladys. Those sons of a bitch who killed Osvaldo like a dog are going to pay with their blood. I promise you that from my heart. (VOICE BREAKING) I'm sorry. I can't continue. I love you all, thank you. Ah, God. Today, members of the Borges gang are going to discover that they can't hide from Sub-21, we're everywhere. What's going on? Why are you being so mysterious? Why don't you go to the dining room with the Borges gang? You'll find out. I can't go to the dining room. They don't want to see me anymore. That's messed up. We need you over there. We need a spy. We need you for information, understand? What is it? What? What are your intentions? With the Borges gang? Justice. Pedro, what's up? Cesar, that shit's solid as a rock now. Perfect, thanks. You're welcome. Ready? You know what? I don't believe you. I think you want to escape from here. (INMATES TALKING INDISTINCTLY) Are you tired? Did I wear you out? Are you finished playing now? Hello. Hi. He's cute. Yeah. What's his name? He's old. His name is Pocho. Can I? Yes, go ahead. He doesn't bite. Hello, Pocho. He's really tired. Yeah. Was he playing? Yes, he's been playing all day. Hello, Pocho. It won't be long before he'll want you to throw him a stick. Really? You're Rogelio, right? Yes. And who are you? I'm that girl, remember? Come on. Let's go. Hurry. Move it.
