 A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES (TAPPING) Let's go. Get up, pieces of shit. MIGUEL: If you see the oppression of the poor and how justice is denied, don't be surprised. The one who loves money never has enough of it, and the one who loves abundance never gains enough. That's ambition and vanity, too. (TAPPING) The more you have, the more you consume. So, what's the benefit for the owners

 aside from looking at it and rejoicing? The poor man's sleep is sweet because the rich man's dissatisfaction stops him from sleeping. Let's go. I saw under the sun what is good and convenient. Eat, drink, and enjoy the fruit of your labor and the time that God gave you on this earth. But instead, I have seen great evil, the wealth kept by the owners to their own detriment. CAPECE: Did you hear me? It smells of concentrated asses and balls in here. Get up, pieces of shit. Let's go! Get up!

 (CONTINUES TAPPING) Let's go, assholes. I want you all lined up for the shower. Get up everyone. Get up everyone. 48 HOURS EARLIER... They want to make Lunati pay for the loot they stole from Borges. It's over three million dollars. What the hell does this have to do with us? It's obvious. Lunati better not even dream that we're going to resolve this and deliver his daughter on a silver platter for chicken feed. Where did you get that? I've been working, too. Look. I've been putting this puzzle together. Gossip, files, news. Lunati intervened in the operation that sent the Borges brothers to the cops. They were dealing liquid cocaine in breast implants that were sent to Europe. So what? That's over three million dollars. Lunati kept the loot. Years later, the Borges took revenge by kidnapping the daughter to get it back. Why the hell do you play the detective? You have the opportunity to make a big deal. Don't just think about yourself, think about Lucas. Don't tell me what I have to think. Your job is to deal with the orders. Get out of here and give Lunati a call. Did you hear me? Did you hear me? Right, tell me, what's wrong with her? Nothing at all. This girl is healthier than all of us together. Can't you see she is unconscious? She fainted ages ago. I have no doubt she is faking it. Her vitals are perfect. There's nothing wrong with her. She's got a brilliant career in acting ahead of her. Screw her! All this disturbance for nothing. Everyone has been mobilized. She's taking us all for fools. I saw her from afar but you examined her. How much do I owe you for the trouble, Doctor? One thousand eight hundred. Thank God there's nothing wrong with her or I'd have to remortgage my house. Do you know why I called you? I need to tell you what's happening to me. We are missing Panza Sosa. I heard. He left for a job and never came back. So what? What happened? It's creating a big mess. A mess that involves all of us. Capece, myself, and you, more than anyone else. I always fall on my feet. I show up. But if the news that we're missing an inmate comes out, you'll be the first to fall. I have no idea where he is or what happened to him. You're lying to me, I saw you in the monitor with a doctor, who wasn't sent by the court, in the workshop. Panza is injured in the jail and they are looking after him. No, I swear that's not it. No? All right. Do you know what my feeling is? That you are lying to me. You think I'm an idiot. Like I just said, I just saw you with the doctor in the workshop. It's true, a doctor came. Ah, it's true. But he didn't come for Panza. It's worse. What do you mean "worse"? AMAYA: (SIGHS) Easy. The doctor said you were going to get better. Thank God for chemotherapy. But you know what? I have a better cure. Love. Love that cures everything. I'm going to warm you up until you get really horny. I'm sure you're not a virgin anymore. I'm sure you've been around. But don't worry, when you open your eyes you're going to beg me to carry on. Get out, son of a bitch. (GRUNTS) (LAUGHING) Thank God for the miracle! She's resurrected. You are sick. (RAPID BREATHING) Easy. Easy. Easy, I'm not a pervert. Easy, I was pretending. I will leave you alone. Calm down. And don't lie again. Did you hear me? (DIALING CELLPHONE) (LINE RINGING) (CELL PHONE CHIMES) Hello. LUNATI: This is Dr. Lunati. Have you heard anything about my daughter? Mmm, no, tomorrow maybe. But I was just about to call you. I think we should revise our agreement. What are you talking about? Miguel and I are aware of the reasons behind the kidnapping. It's link to the silicone operation, right? Are you blackmailing me? Not at all. I'm asking for a pay that matches the job. We had an arrangement, Palacios. No, we had an agreement when it was a run-of-the-mill kidnapping, but now it's not anymore. Anyway, I think we will easily come to an agreement. We all want to find your daughter safe and sound. This sounds like abuse to me. How do you want us to do it then? I'll get in touch again. (CELL PHONE BEEPS) (ENGINE STARTS) I'm very surprised to be the only one who has an unfavorable report about Diosito. He's the most troublesome guy in the jail. You know what I'm talking about. I don't see him as troublesome. He's done two thirds of his sentence and he should get a provisional release. It's within his rights. (CHUCKLES) Congratulations Capece. It was about time you saw the prisoners' rights. The truth is that it's very encouraging. All right, Emma. Don't start. I'm asking you. What matters here is that Diosito Borges is an inmate with good behavior. What we can't do is send the judge a file with such conflicting opinions. How is it possible, Emma, that we all agree on the fact that Diosito can handle freedom except from you? I don't know, I'm wondering the same. I'm in his wing every day and I've never seen him start a conflict. It's rather the opposite. In your report, Emma, you describe Diosito as a psychopath. Mmm-hmm. Dr. Kalina thinks the complete opposite. Is that right, Doctor? According to the interviews I've had with Juan Pablo, I can see clearly that he is not someone dangerous for society. Lately he's made some great progress. He has matured a lot. Excuse me, are we talking about the same person? Diosito? Borges' brother? The most dangerous person in this jail? Yes, we are talking about the same person. He controls the whole jail, but that's not worth discussing. Neither is his cocaine addiction. ANTIN: You're mistaken. Borges doesn't control the jail, I control the jail. And you are going too far. You can't say or report things that you can't prove. I can prove it. In any case, I don't know why we're discussing provisional release, since you're the ones deciding who comes in and who goes out. You're crossing the line, Emma. We're talking privately. I'm not filing a report. What I don't understand is why did you ask me for an evaluation since you've already made up your mind. Just tell me where to sign and I'll decide what to do. How am I going to tell you where to sign? What's going on? (WHISPERS INDISTINCTLY) All right, I'm leaving. I'm leaving. I have to go. (SPANISH SONG PLAYING) Easy. Where is your boss? Peaceful moments in jail are as rare as good people. You savor them. Hmm. Another peaceful moment. Amongst good people. We're all sinners. Eh. There are sins and there are injustices. My brother, for example. He's a good boy really. Too good to be here. When I look after him he thinks I treat him as if he was stupid. (CHUCKLES) But when there was trouble, everyone ran away, and he came to talk to me about you. What's going on? Have there been kisses? What happened? How is he? What did he tell you? That you're a good person. Huh. But I think more like you. We are all sinners. I have a hard time thinking there can be another good person apart from my brother. It's not about what I think, it's what God says. (CHUCKLES) Look. People call my brother Diosito. I thought it was a stupid nickname. But between the two of us, I'm the dumbest. Sometimes I have things in front of me, and I can't see them. That's why I believe in him. Diosito says you're the best person to run the courtyard. Morcilla is a moron, even dogs have no respect for him. That fag doesn't even defend what he fucks. You could easily resolve the fuss in the courtyard. Did you go to school or did you learn to talk like that reading the Bible? Reading the Bible. Thing is, today's assholes are not like the ones before. I pay attention to my brother because that's how it should be. What's in it for me? Having a better time. No one here knows anything about you. Sometimes that's a good thing because no one notices you. But here, the ones that don't get noticed, come out of here in a coffin. Think about it. It's an opportunity. All right. And pray. Pray. Mario, we've got a problem. Antin came to me. They know where we keep the girl. He's looking for you. He knows everything. The peaceful moment in jail is over. For fuck's sake. Tsk. MAN: Come on boss, accelerate a bit. (ENGINE REVVING) Put it into first gear but don't let go of the clutch. I'm not stupid. All right. That's perfect. Go, try it. Come on. Come with me. (SNIFFLES) Hey, wild thing. Did you see we paid you attention? With what? The things from the theft are by the courtyard door. Ah, that's good. CESAR: Here you have a couple of cards. I hope there'll be a gesture on the other side or it'll get stingy. Look, so you don't have to be too honest, here, keep that. Look at you, you can draw well. Shame you didn't pursue it. What's that? The old jail? Yes. That's how I imagine it after hearing so many stories. What stories? Prisoners used to say there was a tunnel that would go all the way to the old jail. You could escape from there. PASTOR: What tunnel? Where is it? I don't know. Ask Verruga. He used to tell the story, he knows. Why would you kidnap the daughter of a judge and put her in jail? In my jail? Fucking hell. It was an emergency solution. A bullshity solution. So what? Bullshit. When this gets out, my career will go down the toilet. No one will find out, Antin. The father of that bitch is the one who needs this to remain a secret. You don't know shit. You are completely disconnected. Things have changed, moron. They've changed, they are different. Now they call you saying "Take us there." They come without warning and they inspect you. I have too many loose ends at the jail. Too many. We didn't want to go over your head. But you did. We wanted to keep you out of this mess. Things got out of hand. But you're right. I'll see how I can get the girl out of there. And then that'll be the end of it. How the hell did you get yourself into this mess? I did for the money. For my money. The money that the bitch's father stole from me. While she's held captive, she can't say anything. How much did he steal from you? How much money? Three and a half big ones. All this for three and a half big ones? Million, Antin. Three and a half million. Ah, you mean 45 million pesos. Do the conversion you want. I don't have cigarettes. There's a kiosk. Buy cigarettes and some chocolate covered peanuts. Chocolate covered peanuts? You're too old for that. Just do it, you idiot. Shove it. EMMA: Did you see the guy I told you about this morning? The one who put me in a bad mood. SOFIA: The cute one. I'm being serious. It's very weird, it's like he doesn't exist. He's not on social network. He doesn't have an address, records, nothing. You're obsessed. If you don't like him, forget about him. Let's deal with the ones we like. I have the inmates. I'll let them in. MAN: Excuse me. SOFIA: Hi, how are you? Hi. Good morning. How's the professor doing? Good. I've made a drawing of Romeo and Juliet for a tattoo. If I was Romeo, I would tattoo it on myself. Thank you. (EXCLAIMS) Counselor. How are you? I just wanted to see you. What do you need? I wanted to know why you had such a bad opinion of me. And why the fuck you want to ruin my parole. I don't know what you know and who has been talking to you, but no one can disclose information on the inmates' reports. Alone? What? We have to count them separately, one by one. Let's do something. Did you see this place? SOFIA: So, two stories. Apartment 5C, right? SOFIA: We have to guess what's a lie and what's the truth. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Are you Verruga? You're blocking the light. What do you want? I've been told you know the old abandoned jail. So? I want to know how to get there. If you're thinking of escaping, I'll tell you now that it's impossible. Not possible? No. What about the legends of escapes through there? Ah. Have you been there? Yes. How did you get there? I've seen many guys try the courtyard's door, but it's not possible. I have nothing to offer you. Why do you want to know? I want to go. I need to see. All right. I'm going to tell you. I have little time left here. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (GROANING) Good morning, blondie. Good morning. These pills give me such a headache. Mmm. But I still want to screw. (BOTH CHUCKLING) If my wife finds out about these pills... Stop. I don't want to start the day like this, hearing about your wife. Please. Hmm. Do you know what you'd need to do? Screw. (LAUGHS) No, see a therapist. No way. My brother says the same. But if I become good, I'll have to go back to my wife. That's not convenient for you. Not convenient at all. Right, honey. I'm going to work. No way. What? I need to work. No, you brought this pill. (LAUGHS) (CAJOLING) Come on, bitch. Does your wife do that to you? (GROANS SOFTLY) Sometimes. (LAUGHS) Does she treat you this good? No. This? Like that? No, come on bitch. (LAUGHS) Yes, please. Like that. (GASPING) Yes. (MOANING) (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) Change the sheets of the middle bed. (CLEARS THROAT) (CHUCKLING) Mario. Oh! Are you relatives of someone here? Don't look at him. Answer to me. Who? I'm Chuenga's sister. What did I say? Fuck off. Mario, stop. You got me out of the courtyard. You don't even want to talk to me anymore. I told you I'm a free man. She's my girlfriend, I cleared that up already. You're his girlfriend? Tell him. Yes. Tell me the truth, honey. I promise he won't bother you anymore. You're coming here to have sex because he owes him money. Does your brother owe him money? No, no. Don't fuck with me. Don't interrupt me. I'm talking to the lady. Come on. We're going to do something. You don't have to say anything. But if you were forced to come here I will take care of it. I'm Mario Borges. I'm going to look after Chuenga. I promise nothing will happen to him. So, you're free. Think about it. Hey. Hey. Talk with me. For you, the grave is a paradise, right? I'm not messing with anyone, but the things you do break my balls. (STAMMERING) Let's calm down, Mario. We need to talk, man to man. Easy, we're friends. Mmm-hmm. You can't exclude me from the business like that, overnight. I've been in it, way before you arrived. I've quietly put up with your people, but I'm not one of your soldiers. Huh? And I'm not your friend either. If you want to talk to me, you know where I am. Moron. (SPANISH SONG PLAYING) (SNIFFLES) You scared me. Sorry. Look at your face. (SNIFFLES) Have you been crying? No. What's going on? Nothing. I saw you speaking with Diosito. (SNIFFLING) Is it about the report? Did he say anything to you? Yes. He threatened me. What? He showed me a photo of my apartment. To scare me. So I would think they are following me. What are you going to do? I don't know. Nothing. What will I do? EMMA: As per our findings during the interviews and the follow-up regarding inmate Juan Pablo Borges, aka Diosito, it's evident that his behavior is outstanding. He is an ideal role model for other inmates who want to reintegrate into society. He has succeeded in breaking from drug addiction. He doesn't consume cocaine, or any other illegal substances. Neither does he intervene or deal with said substance inside the jail. Like his older brother, another model inmate, he doesn't participate in any prison gang or illegal group. For the reasons explained above, in my expert opinion I approve this inmate's parole application. Counselor Emma Molinari. (SINGING) Let's go for a wash, tramp. INMATE 1: Smells like ass, moron. (CHUCKLES) Why are you laughing? INMATE 2: He always smells like ass. INMATE 1: Last night I dreamed I was going to Mirtha Legrand. I said I dreamed, man. It was a dream. There was no food, there were cockroaches. (LAUGHTER) Hey, Picachu, you're the mystical one. What does it mean? You need to stop doing hard drugs. (GRATING) VERRUGA: The cleaning closet has a false wall. You go through and you'll find a staircase that'll take you to the basement. You go to the end, and there's an exit to the courtyard. (GRUNTS) And then you're in the old jail. Nice ranch, right? Very nice. Look at this swimming pool. See? The property is quite far from the road. Meaning, it's not easy to get there. The access is complicated, which is a good thing. There's a grove of trees that hides everything. The landlord's house is pretty far from the main house. I can tell the guy that some friends are coming, and to not disturb them. What a nice ranch you have. You do have it all figured out. Don't make fun of me. This cost me a lot of work. It's not easy to deal with sons of a bitches like you. No. That's okay. (EXHALES) It's just what we need. It's great. It's perfect. I'll send you a pen drive with photos and map that'll show you how to get there. All right? Mmm. How's the negotiation going with the girl's father? I don't know what the hell this moron is thinking. Why? He's playing with the daughter's life. Why? He's not paying. He hasn't reported the kidnapping. He's speculating. He's trying to buy time. All I know is that you, me, and any of the guys in here for our kids we'd give anything, we'd do anything. But that piece of shit is heartless. He's a piece of shit. What do we do with Panza Sosa? Panza is not coming back. What do you mean, he's not coming back? He was lost during the kidnapping. Bullshit. We're going to need a substitute just like we did with Galindez. We're going to have to take good care of the family. I already have. The other day, the woman came to see me. "Where is my husband?" I had to throw a few pesos at her to buy time. So when I told you that Sosa was with family, you knew I was deceiving you. The face. What face? I only have the face of a moron. Take that into account next time. Your pen drive. (DOOR OPENS) Luna, my name is Miguel. I'm a police officer. I work for your dad. Shh. Shh. Shh. I work for your dad. (HEAVY BREATHING) Calm down. Calm down, don't scream. I'll take my hand off your mouth but don't scream. There are guards outside. If you scream they'll kill us both. Is that clear? (SHUSHING) How are you? Did they hit you? Are you hurt? Can you walk? Can you run? Huh? I'm all right. Tired, but they're treating me the best they can. That's good. Where are we? They have other people locked in here. I heard voices. That was me. I was locked near here. We are in a jail. I want to go home. Please take me home. Please. (SHUSHING) I'm going to help you. I can't get you out now. I need you to be patient. I promise I'll come back, okay? Okay. I'm going to come back and get you out of here. Stay calm. Just a little bit more and no more. Shh. Thank you. (MAN WHISTLING) (LATCH OPENS) AMAYA: Good morning, good morning. Don't play dead again. No, I got it now. What do you say? Good morning. I have good news for you. I'm going back home? Not that good. But you're leaving this place for somewhere more comfortable. Where are you taking me? Don't think we are that stupid. We get that a princess like you can't stay in a pigsty. The only place you have to take me is my home. That's not up to us. It's up to your dad, who refuses to compromise. What did you do? Why doesn't he love you even a little bit? You're pretty naughty, aren't you? You want me to feel bad? Why would I want to make you feel bad? You know I grew fond of you. I'm the only one who can stand you. Plus I already told you, when you're older, we'll get married and we'll have a home full of love. Unlike what you have now. What's that? What? That's blood. Do you have your period? Who was here? I haven't seen anyone. Someone was here. There hasn't been anyone, I swear. Tell me who was here! Son of a bitch. (VOCALIZING) Someone was in Luna's cell. (PANTING) Just now. What are you saying? I don't know, there's blood. He went through the old jail. Where are the others? In the workshop. Stop. Mario doesn't like us making decisions without him. Don't piss me off. When my brother isn't here, I decide. Check if the pipe in the kitchen is still sealed. I'll check the cleaning room. Rancho, it went bad. I'm coming. Fuck. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) (GASPS) Hey, what's up? What's going on? Where have you been? Nothing, I was just hanging around. (EXCLAIMS) That's it? (PANTING) Social worker report, Counselor Emma Molinari. File... Borges, Juan Pablo. Diosito. The inmate, Juan Pablo Borges, aka Diosito, has demonstrated outstanding behavior. He has no traces of cocaine in his system. Neither does he intervene or manage the illegal drug dealing in the jail. Same as his brother, Borges, Mario. He doesn't participate in any prison gang or illegal group. You must be kidding me. I assume you aren't aware. At least that's what I'd like to believe. What? Diosito threatened me. He knows where I live and I don't want to risk my life for this. How does he know where you live? Yes. He showed me pictures of my apartment. Or he has someone outside who is following me. Or even worse, someone here gave him my address and sent someone to take pictures to intimidate me. No. You're kidding me, this is very serious. Of course it's serious. Extremely serious. How can an inmate know I wrote an unfavorable report? No matter how important the inmate is. What Diosito did is very serious. I'm going to find out who is carrying out his orders outside. Hmm? All right. With regards to the report, what do you want me to write? I don't care about Diosito's parole. Forget it. Me as director, I'm going to file the report and that's it. This son of a bitch thinks he has us by the balls. He's wrong. All right. Don't worry. Thank you. (DOOR OPENS) (DOOR CLOSES) Tell us who came to see you, Luna. My boss doesn't have as much patience as me. Talk. I don't know, I didn't see anyone. I was sleeping. Could the blood be yours? (SIGHS) Girl. Don't be a smart ass. Up until now we treated you well. Don't piss me off. I can't stand your old man anymore. I've been holding back for days, but I feel like sending him your head wrapped in gift paper. When I was your age, I was working in a slaughter house, so I'm not scared of cutting someone into pieces. In fact, these days it bothers me more to kill a cow. Poor thing. I'm listening. It was a fat guy. Hmm. Fat? How? Fat and hairy like you. Ah! What did he want? Tell me what he wanted. (HEAVY BREATHING) Let me go. What did he say? What did he want? He didn't say anything, he came in and he left. Mother fucker. Fucking bitch. Let's not waste any more time. She doesn't want to help, fine. No more special treatment. Tie up the other hand. Gag her. Don't give her anything to eat or drink. If she wants to shit, she can shit in her pants. How is that my fault, moron? I didn't see him well. I've had enough of you. Do you know why you are still alive? Because I need to record some videos to send to your dad. So be grateful for every breath you get to take. Now I get why Lunati doesn't give a shit. We did him a favor by taking away this bag of shit. (DOOR OPENS) (DOOR CLOSES) Which camera faces the warehouse door? MORCILLA: Number 12. Are you sure? That you are an idiot? I like men who are brave and determined. Mario, I'm here. Hmm. If I didn't come earlier, it's not because I was scared. I know I didn't screw up. I didn't come because your brother advised me to stay away for a few days. They stole from me like they could have stolen from anyone. What do you want? I want... I want to go back to my spot in the courtyard. This business is mine, too. It belongs to me. (CHUCKLES) Don't laugh. Let's talk as equals. No one cared about that courtyard. I made it grow. Don't disrespect me. I wouldn't be here if I did. I would have done it all myself. What happened to you? Did you hurt yourself? The guys from the villa. They hit me with a bottle the other day. (MEN YELLING) MAN: The door. Why is it not healing? I didn't go to the nurse's office because it wasn't serious, but it still hasn't healed. Morcilla is telling the truth and this guy is worse off than him. Pastor? How is he going to be worse. What are you saying? Can you shut up? I don't care about your friend. Go get that woodpecker. Take him to the workshop. I want a face to face. I want both versions. What do you think? (SPANISH SONG PLAYING) Hey, Picachu. What? Pastor? PICACHU: I think he's here. Pastor. Diosito is looking for you. What are you doing? Is everything okay? Where were you? Here, messing around. I haven't seen you all day. I went to your brother's but I didn't see you. I was involved in some stuff. My brother wants to see you. PASTOR: Now? Yes. Now. All right. Here we are. You can go. Why? Why do I have to go? What are you going to do? Nothing. Go back to your business. And give Antin his stuff back. All right. I'm going. What does the Bible say about lies? Blessed are those who wash their robes that they may have the right to the tree of life and may go to the city. But outside are the dogs, the sorcerers, the sexually immoral, the murderers, and everyone who practices falsehood. I've always been fascinated by the memory of those who believe in God. Always. (SPITS) Did you understand a word of what he said? Some. Yes. So, it's dangerous to lie. Why? Because you put down a lie and you have to cover it with another and another, and another. And soon you're drowning in it. That's why the best liars are those who talk the least. Understood? Yes. Here we do business. Everyone knows that. But we are comfortable. I mean, we eat. We live. We let live. Until, from time to time, (EXCLAIMS) ...someone dies. Ooh! Then we say, "Of course, nothing in life is free." Even Jesus on the cross must have thought the same. "I traded my life for these morons?" But it was too late when he realized. Late. (MARIO GROANS) (SPITS) (METAL CLANGS) That's why sometimes, it's better to only kill one, even if it's the Christ, instead of killing a pile of morons. Do you still get it? Yes. I'm not sure. Take this, son of 1,000 bitches. Take it! Take it! Who do you think you are messing with? Son of a bitch. (GRUNTS) Take it. Wash Sibinski's car. I don't want problems of religion here.
