 A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) Hi. How are you? Hello, sir. How is everything going? What a stupid question, right? If you say so, sir. ANTIN: Rico was a good guy. Do we know for sure that Sub-21 is responsible? Yes, sir, it's been confirmed. ANTIN: She's the widow, right? MAN: Yes.

 Give me a second. Excuse me, are you the widow? Yes. My condolences. My deepest sympathies. LUCRE: My condolences as well. Rico was a great man, he was highly respected. He was an officer with a true calling. He was a role model, we will always carry his memory in our hearts. I can't make any promises because it doesn't depend on me, but I will do my best to hang a plaque with Rogelio Rico's name, in honor of everything that he represented to the prison community. Who are you?

 Antin, I'm the director of San Onofre. How dare you come here? No. Let go of me. Hold on a second. LUCRE: Calm down, please. Just wait. I know who you are. Let me go. Calm down. You're responsible for what happened to my husband. The only thing I did was protect him. Protect him? You suspended him, you sent him home and they killed him in the plaza. They killed him! Get this son of a bitch out of here! I'm carrying his baby! Get him out! I'm going to kill him! (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) (WAILING) Go fuck yourself! What assholes! Calm down, their reaction is only natural. Why the fuck did you make me come here? We could have sent a wreath. They can all go to hell. Calm down. Come on. Fucking assholes. (CELL PHONE RINGING) Hello. Yes. What's up Capece? I'm just leaving a nasty situation at Rico's. (SIGHS) They're rioting in the visitors' room? What? But who is... Which gang is it? The guards are rioting in protest against what happened to Rico. They can go fuck themselves. They can go to hell. Tell them I'm on my way and that I'm going to beat the shit out of... Come on! Shut up! (METAL CLANGING) (MEN SHOUTING) MARIO: What the fuck is going on? What's going on Capece? The guards are protesting. The whole place is in an uproar. Fuck. Fucking cunt. Make us some mate tea, please. Thanks. INMATE: What pieces of shit. Come here! What are you waiting for? An e-mail invite? There aren't a lot of guards around. No one in this country wants to work. What are they protesting about now? Rico's death. DIOS: Poor guy. They say he died next to his dog, in a plaza. They gave it to him right there. Oh, did he have kids? INMATE: I heard his wife is pregnant. At the end of the day, he got off easy. A few shots in the chest and that's it. He didn't even have time to suffer. On the other hand, I heard Osvaldo suffered a lot. We should take advantage of this situation. In the absence of guards, we can more easily attack the Sub-21 gang and raise shit. Relax. Don't worry. Marito already has a plan. What plan? What do you know? Enjoy your shitty meal. What's wrong with him? What's wrong with you? Are you in love? You're distracted. This idiot's in love. DIOS: Really? Yeah. What are you saying? With who? He fell for Mrs. Molinari. Stop saying stupid shit because people will end up believing it. She's way out of reach. My brother tried to pick her up, he's incredibly charming, and even he couldn't win her over. Your brother, Rati? Yeah. How does he know her? I asked my brother to contact her to help her verify some information. One day, I was fixing the wall with this guy and he seemed attracted to her. Now they're together. You have a wild imagination. As if a woman like that is going to pay attention to me. Since when are you so modest? Good for you, she's quite the catch! Personally, I wouldn't give her a second look, but congratulations. She must be a good fuck. You're talking shit. DIOS: He never said a word to me about Molinari. Why didn't he tell me about her? I think you're obsessing over something that may not be true. (SHUSHING) Keep your voice down! Pastor is probably listening in. Pastor? On the other side of the door? Why would he be on the other side of the door listening? Because he wants to know what I think of his relationship with that chick. (SCOFFS) It's just a rumor, they're probably just joking with you. Joking? Triste confirmed it. No he didn't. He used the word "seemed" and that's not a confirmation. What's wrong with you? Did that snake get to you too? She's a colleague. A colleague? Come on. You've got more issues with her than I do. (SIGHS) I disagree. Either way, let's get back to what you were saying. You think Pastor has a sexual relationship with Mrs. Molinari. She did it on purpose. I know it. She's mad at me for putting the squeeze on her a few months ago. So now she wants to take away my friend. Take away? Can't he still be your friend? She's got... How do you say... A hold on him. That's it. So, you're saying that Pastor can't be your friend and at the same time, have a relationship with a woman? I know what you're trying to get at. What? You're calling me a fag. And he's treating me like a fag too. Dios! You'll see, cunt! (SIGHS) (CLEARS THROAT) Hello. Excuse me. Who are you? What are you doing here? I'm a friend of the family. We're looking for information about the boy who lived here with them. He's still missing and we still don't know anything. Did you know the family? No, I don't know anything. I didn't have any contact with them. Do you know anyone here who might have known them or who may have information? Why don't you try the grocer around the corner? One of the girls who works there knew the family. Okay, perfect. Thanks so much. You're welcome. Can I ask you a favor? Can you stop coming here? This used to be a quiet neighborhood and now everyone is shaken up, nervous. I can imagine. Yes. Goodbye. Thanks. Goodbye. (INDISTINCT CHATTERS) Mario. Thanks. You're welcome. So? You're not going to tell us anything? What do you want me to tell you? How are we going to respond to those bastards in the courtyard? As revenge for Osvaldo. Are we just going to leave it? I'm sick of playing this game of an eye for an eye. MAN: So, we're not going to do anything? MARIO: No, I have an idea. We have to annihilate the Sub-21 gang. We have to finish them off for good. I underestimated them. They're very good at recovering and organizing themselves. If we keep playing their game, this will never end. So, I'm going to wipe them out, all of them. What happened here? I don't know but I'll help tidy up. (SIGHS) Cesar, will you lend me a hand? That's fine, I'll finish. Okay, I'll send a janitor over. Okay. Goodbye. Sit down. What's going on? With what? Your family is worried, they say you don't want to see them. Honestly, I don't want to see anyone. Hmm. Is it because of what happened in the showers? It's not a big deal. It's done. What do you mean, "It's done?" A bunch of guys grabbed you and almost killed you. It's over now. Are you seeing the psychologist? No. You should go. (CHUCKLES) I'm fine. So can I tell them that they can come visit you now? If they want to come, they can come. I'm here. Either way, you should see the psychologist. (CHUCKLES) Seriously. Okay. I need to ask you a favor. You have influence in the courtyard, will you do something for me? Why don't you ask Pastor? I prefer to ask you. (CHUCKLES) Okay, what is it? There are two new inmates arriving. One is Chinese and doesn't speak Spanish, and the other is Pipita, he wants to go to the courtyard. I'd like you to welcome them and treat them well. Can you do that? Okay, you can count on me. Good. And promise me you'll see the psychologist. I promise. Okay. (LAUGHS) Now I have to clean up this mess. All right. See you. Thanks. Can I have this? Leave it here. He cares more about inmates than guards. Why do you say that? He suspended a guard and left him to his own fate. (DOOR OPENS) What's going on here, gentlemen? People are waiting to see their relatives. GUARD: They can go to hell! You have to listen to us! What's wrong with you? Stop! Hold on a second. Are you representing these people? Are you representing these people's demands? They want their grievances to be heard. And who am I? Aren't I the prison's director? You want to talk? Let's talk in a civilized manner. Let's go to my office and clear things up. They don't want to talk to you. The attorney general is here. ANTIN: I can't believe this! Thanks for coming, Octavio. I'm sorry they bothered you for something so silly. Look, Antin. Whenever someone mentions San Onofre it's never just a silly little thing. We have serious problems. No, it's not like that. Come in. (DOOR CLOSES) Hold on. Wait. Listen to me. I have to ask you something. What? Do you know a lady named Carla? Listen to me carefully, there is a lady named Carla, she was your sister-in-law's friend, she used to visit your brother's house. Do you know her? I don't know. Why? Because she's the one in the photo with Lucas. I suspect Lucas is probably with her. How do you know? I went to your brother's house. I walked around the neighborhood. I talked to some of the neighbors and they told me about her. It seems she was frightened by what happened and instead of taking Lucas to the police, she left with him. Where? I don't know. But I have the name of the guesthouse where her mother lives. I was thinking of going there to see if I can get more information. Be careful. Yes. Be careful wherever you go. Don't worry. This is a good lead, maybe we'll find him. Yes. Thank you. Son of a bitch! What sons of bitches! What other surprises did they bring me? Is it true that some inmates were missing in today's roll call? Yes, Arevalo, Troncoso and Diaz. Thanks. (SIGHS DEEPLY) I found one of them. Ugh. How did this get on my plate? I don't know. They gave me the plate, I just brought it to you. We're tired of asking for increased guard security. The inmates are in charge here. If you look at them sideways, they want to report you for abuse. They killed Rico outside but it was payback for a courtyard incident. No, you're confusing facts. Our salaries are too low, some guys need two jobs. That's not up to me. And we have to pay for our uniforms. Gentlemen, can you put together a list of demands and recommendations? And as a sign of good faith, please go back to work. All right, Doctor. Give your list to Doctor Belardo and he'll deliver it to me. I'll take care of everything. I want you to know I don't appreciate you going over my head. Can we talk for a minute? Sure. Capece, come. This is exactly what we needed for the guards to break their silence. We just need to pressure them a little. You need to make them talk. Give them all the guarantees they want. LUCRE: Antin. No, this isn't the time... It's very important. Okay, what's going on? Three inmates were missing in this morning's roll call. Did they escape? I don't know, we can't find them, Arevalo, Diaz and Troncoso. Diaz? I know what's going on. Tell Cesar and Pena to come to my office. Okay. One thing... Antin. Yes. Excuse me. Yes. Excuse me, good afternoon. I'd like to talk to you one-on-one. Me too. Let's go to my office, I'll explain everything to give you the full picture. Let's go, Lucrecia. Doctor, this way, please. I'll make some coffee. Who's in the kitchen? Chavo, Piltrafa, Patito and another guy. But I don't think they... You don't know shit. No, Mario. You're an idiot. No, Mario. You're an idiot and you're not watching my back. We're in the middle of a war and you're not doing your job. You leave me wide open, you're a bunch of idiots. It's not like that, Mario. Fucking bastard. Shut your mouth, you piece of shit! Fucking cunt! Everyone, listen up! Some son of a bitch contaminated my food with this finger. I'm sure there's a rat from Sub-21 here. I want you to tell those assholes that these pranks don't scare Borges. When their mothers were trying to decide whether to get an abortion or throw them in a ditch, I'd already been around the block a few times. You can tell all of the pieces of shit out there that they can't outsmart Borges, I'll always be two steps ahead of them. Thank you. You're welcome. Please treat the new inmates well, okay? Don't worry. DIOS: I brought you another worker to speed up repairs. You're coming to work here? Is that how you greet a friend? Mrs. Molinari. How are you? Everything okay? Mmm-hmm. DIOS: Is there a problem? Here, take this. This establishment of San Onofre had always been a shining example. In the past, there had never been any jailbreaks or riots, no one had ever been hurt or tortured here. We didn't have gang fights or jail Mafia. We saw very little drug addiction. Have a seat, Doctor. But after I was nominated as a candidate for the role of security sub-secretary, that's when all the issues started. Today, San Onofre is a nest for all kinds of problems, jailbreaks, crimes, Mafia, etc. Don't you find that fascinating? As far as I know, this place was never a model establishment. Just because you didn't know doesn't mean it isn't true. You're an experienced politician, you know very well that when people keep a low profile and their mouths shut, they don't have any problems. It's only when you speak your mind and stand up for what you believe in that problems arise. If you shake things up, it makes people nervous and they begin to play dirty. These are serious accusations. If you have names, give them to me. I have names but I can't give them to you now because I don't have proof. These are powerful people who are against our state policy of managing criminals. Discipline and punishment, as Foucault said. I'm completely against the idea of promising guaranteed rights. I see you're interested in politics. Ever since I was a boy. Politicians are experts in the art of hiding the obvious. I'll give you the benefit of the doubt on everything you say. There have been very serious incidents here in San Onofre, deaths... Those were just incidental. (CLEARS THROAT) Incidental? Yes, I mean... You're denying everything. Excuse me. No, I'm not denying. I brought you some coffee. It's Lucrecia, right? Yes, that's right. I hope the coffee's good. If you made it, I'm sure it's perfect. LUCRE: Sugar or sweetener? That's all, thanks. Excuse me. Nice ass! (SPITS) Can we take a break? No, we just started. I'm not talking to you. Pastor, you want to go for a smoke? No, you go. DIOS: You want me to beg you, bitch? Did you call me "bitch?" Why are you looking at me like that? What happened between you two? Did you fuck? No, I was joking. DIOS: He's different with me now. He used to be my friend. He wanted me to introduce him to my brother for work. Now he says he's independent, but he's onside with the Sub-21 gang. I told you, I'm not on their side. Really? That's not right. You should side with your friends, like Triste. Now Triste here, he's a loyal guy. Don't drag me into this. Let's just all get to work. DIOS: What's wrong? Am I bothering you here? Are you afraid I'll screw things up with your lady? Why don't you stop busting my balls? It seems you're doing it on purpose. Of all the women in the world, you go after the one I hate most. You smoke too much shit, it's fucking up your brain. What do you mean? This is craziness. Did you know that I didn't get my temporary leave because of that cunt? That's why I'm locked up here. That slut wanted to fuck up my life. It doesn't matter. I'll get the last laugh. (SNIFFLES) Now that you're chasing after her, do you want her home address? No, I don't want you to give me anything. I did some research. I even know her bra size. Listen to me, moron. Don't you understand that I don't want you to hassle me with this anymore? And leave her alone, you piece of shit. What's wrong? You like fucking her? I'm going to the place I told you about. We'll catch up later, okay? Okay. Goodbye. Thanks. Hello. (BABY CRYING) (MUSIC PLAYING OVER RADIO) Do you want to play ball? Hello, good day. Excuse me, sir. I'm looking for a lady named Nora, she staying here. No, I don't know her. Do you know who I can ask? Who are you? Emma, I'm her friend. I'm looking for her. Maybe someone here could give me some information? The manager, but she's not here now. Come back tonight. Okay, thanks, sorry to bother you. Lucas? Are you Lucas? I'm a friend of your dad's, Miguel. You're Miguel's friend? Yes, Emma. He's looking for you. WOMAN: Axel, come here. Hello. Are you Carla? Don't be frightened. I'm Emma, a friend of Miguel, Lucas' dad. CARLA: I still can't get the image out of my head. She was dead on the floor in a pool of blood. Poor Lucas was hiding under the bed. (SOBS) I don't know how anyone could kill Betina like that. She was my friend. Fernando got involved with the wrong people. They were about to leave. He wanted to leave quickly and get away for a while. He sensed they were in danger. We escaped to Santiago. He was afraid that if he came back, they'd find him and do something to him too. They said it was payback, revenge. I had to come back because I couldn't find work there. Are you working now? Luckily, yes. They let me bring Lucas to work. You don't have anyone to watch him? No. My mom used to babysit but she had to return to Santiago, my brothers needed her. Did you talk to the police? Lucas' father was a policeman and he's in jail now, right? I didn't know if I could trust them. You did the right thing. You can't trust anyone. Thankfully we found each other. Miguel is very worried about Lucas. He didn't know where to find him. Are you his girlfriend? Yes. Are you going to help me? Of course. Lucas has to go back to school and return to a nice normal life. He's very quiet, the poor thing. He doesn't cry. But I know he's suffering. Come, sit down. LUCRE: We've got problems, right? Yes, we've got problems. Since I've become a nominee for the sub-secretary of security role some of my fellow candidates are trying to discredit me by making me look bad. Fuck. We knew what to expect but this is too much. I hear they're planning to intervene. No! Don't say that! Well... Don't even suggest such a thing! I'll screw the attorney general in the ass before they intervene. (CHUCKLES) I didn't know this side of you but you could always ask him. See what he says, maybe he wants to try something new, a new experience. The attorney general's not interested in men. He likes girls, he appreciates feminine beauty. He likes pretty, fuckable girls like you. What are you suggesting? Perhaps it's time for you to do something to help our cause. What cause? Our cause. Didn't we agree to move up together to the security office? The attorney general likes women, he likes you and thinks you're beautiful. He has asked me to introduce you to him. You're joking. No! Is it so hard to imagine that he's attracted to you? You're a beautiful woman, those eyes... I know men find me attractive. So? This is different. You're asking me to give myself to him to get you out of trouble. I'm asking you to fuck him to get me out of this. You're asking me to prostitute myself. For free. I don't understand why the horse has to move like that. I don't know, it's just one of the rules of the game. It doesn't matter why. He moves like that, that's it. It's shit. No, it's a good game. It's strategic, these are life skills. Really? Will this help me become a better thief? (LAUGHS) Inspection, fucking cunts! (INMATES CLAMORING) Inspection, get out! Get out! (INMATES SHOUTING) Come on. GUARD: Get out! Move into the courtyard! CAPECE: Inspection! Let's go! Everyone outside! Move it! I said, "Out!" INMATE: I didn't do anything, stop. (SCREAMS) Wait! CAPECE: I like it when you're nice and quiet. Did you hear me? Let's go! That's how I like it. You didn't find anything? Come on Capece, there's nothing here. Stop fucking around. You don't have anything, pieces of shit? You're clever. We're poor, go search Borges. You're poor? You two, come with me. Where? Come on. Walk. Move it. You too, come on. I wanted to clarify a few things with you. PASTOR: About the search in the courtyard? They just broke everything. Stop, I'm talking. First of all, I heard that you had a situation in the showers. Is that true? CESAR: Yes. ANTIN: What happened? They came in while I was showering and they hit me. ANTIN: They beat the shit out of you. Yes. Okay. That day Rico was in charge of the showers. He was monitoring that section. Did you know that Rico was killed? No. The Sub-21 gang killed him. They assassinated him in Torcuato. Do you know what this is? A medallion, of course. (CHUCKLES) But who does it belong to? This medallion belonged to Pablo Diaz. Do you know who Pablo Diaz was? One of the three inmates who disappeared. And listen to this, a little bird told me that it was those three who beat you up in the shower. Did you know that? No, their heads were covered. What do you know about the finger that Borges found on his plate? Do you know anything? You don't know shit. You're usually better informed than most. It's as if someone were constantly giving you advice. Pena knows that I want things to get better. But for things to get better we have to agree on a framework. Are you following me? Because you're looking at me like... No. You don't understand? How can I explain this to you? This prison, San Onofre, is like a boat. It's sailing south. I'm in charge and you're on deck. I sense trouble and say that the boat might sink. Why would it sink? Because the crew thinks they can navigate through stormy waters without a captain. And you can't. Are you following? I need to navigate a course and bring the boat safely into port. If the boat sinks, I'll be the first to fall, and you're going to drown like rats. Kill each other if you want but stop busting my balls. Get out. I said, get out! Idiots. These two guys are pussies. My niece hits harder than that. (LAUGHS) I miss boxers like Rona. I saw him in '94, Jackson vs. Rona. It was extraordinary. Rona was knocked down, just lying there motionless. It looked like he was going to throw in the towel but as soon as Jackson let his guard down, Rona gave him a left hook and nailed him! It was fantastic! That's what we need to do. Let them hit us, let them come. It doesn't matter if they see us stumble. It doesn't matter, let them hit us. You're going to take them by surprise. What are you talking about? What do you know? What does he know that I don't? You talk too much. You'll go and tell the psychologist or some other idiot. Is this all of them? I think there are some new ones too. MARIO: It doesn't matter. They can fuck themselves for going to the courtyard. What the fuck are you talking about? Let me see that paper. Give it to me, Marito. You'll find out. No, I want to know now. (MOCKINGLY) "I want to know now." (GIGGLES) What are you laughing at? That's not right. If you open your mouth I'll pull out your tongue with my teeth. Do you understand? Yes, I won't say anything. Tell me. Come here. Do you know how we got rid of garbage when I was little? How? We set it on fire. (LIGHTER CLICKS) (CHUCKLES) EMMA: We're here. Let me turn on the light. This is it. This is my house. Welcome. Do you like it? Yes. Yes? Yes. Where's the cat? He's lazy, I'm sure he's in my bedroom. Look, there's Pancho, sleeping like always. Hello, Pancho. LUCAS: Hi there. Can I touch him? Yes, of course. Hello Pancho, I brought you a friend. This is Lucas. This is my bed, this is where I sleep. Where am I going to sleep? Wherever you want. We can put a mattress next to mine. Are you hungry? Yes, very. Would you like to cook something together? We'll be back Pancho. Let's go see what's in the fridge. (EXHALES) Wow! You're quite the helper! This is extra. No, my sister is coming to eat with us. I want you to meet her. You'll like her. I'm glad you're here because I'm terrible at setting the table. It's easy. It looks great. (DOORBELL RINGS) That must be Mabel. I'll get the door. Hi. You're right on time. How are you? I'm fine. How are you? I'm hanging in there, more or less. And my friend Lucas? I don't know. He was here. I even brought him a present. Is he in the bathroom? Lucas. Luke. Luke are you here? Lucas! Is he playing hide and seek? Lucas? Luke? Luke. (CUPBOARD DOOR RATTLING) What are you doing there? Are you afraid? Why? Because of the door? I'm sorry. I should have told you. It's my sister. Nothing is going to happen to you here. I'll take care of you. Okay? Do you want to meet my sister? I think she brought you a present. Come. Slowly. Come. (GROANS) That's it. Are you okay? Yes. Yes? Yes. Let me introduce you to Mabel. (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) Pass it over here. Come on. You don't know how to play. Suck this. You didn't stop. You threw me on the ground. This Chinese guy is going to take Picachu's spot. You can all fuck him or ask him for acupuncture. Don't bother talking to him, he doesn't understand shit. Everything okay? What's up with this guy? The Chinese are all the same. INMATE: Come on, let's go. Pass. I'm so sick of being stuck inside. I want to be on a beach, at night, and feel the wind on my face. I don't want to think about anything. You could be surrounded by girls dancing and moving their ass. No, no one from here. With no one around to bust my balls. Alone? (SIGHS) With Gladys. Mmm. I hate being away from her especially now. Mmm. Osvaldo's death was hard on you. The guy was like a brother to me. Like you. (COUGHS) (CHUCKLES) Do you remember when he scored a goal on those guys from Don Bosco? (LAUGHS) He moved the ball nicely. He played well. He yelled in their faces. That's why they got so pissed off. (LAUGHS) We ran so much that day. When someone so close to you dies, there's a part of you that goes with them. We need to be stronger than ever now. DIOS: When you stop acting like a superhero, you can count on me. I'm here. Are we really going to set the courtyard on fire with the guys inside? I'm sick of it. I'm tired. I don't want to have to fight to prove myself anymore. I want this to be done, finally. That's it. Finished. Enough. Enough. But we have friends in the courtyard too. You're worried about Pena? What's wrong with you? Is he your boyfriend? Are you gay? I'm not gay. He's my friend. Don't worry. We'll rescue our friends. The key is to nail all Sub-21 members and their cronies. (SNORTS) Give me a hit. Are you serious? Just one hit, it's nothing... One hit won't do any harm. Now that's a hit, son of a bitch. This is the good stuff, it's powerful shit. (SNORTS) You won't need anymore. That's enough. (SNIFFS) How could you eat a finger? (LAUGHS HYSTERICALLY) Did you see their faces? God! They almost threw up their breakfast. How disgusting. (LAUGHING) Did you eat the nail too? I already shit it out. (LAUGHING) How are you going to set the whole courtyard on fire? (SIGHS) James is making preparations. For when? When Argentina plays Brazil. We'll bring in some big screens that will distract them a bit. (CLICKS TONGUE) We're going to miss the game? We have to set up a huge grill in the courtyard. It's going to be quite the BBQ. My lord. (THEME SONG PLAYING) EL MARGINAL IS A FICTIONAL SHOW. ANY RESEMBLANCE TO EXISTING EVENTS, CHARACTERS, NAMES AND/OR CIRCUMSTANCES IS PURELY COINCIDENTAL.
