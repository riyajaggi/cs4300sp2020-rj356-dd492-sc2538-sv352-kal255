 Miguel. (CHUCKLES) Do you remember when he was born? DOCTOR: Do you remember anything about the birth? That's him. My eldest son. Was he cute? Like his father. DOCTOR: Was he handsome? No? I liked him. You have a lot of pictures there. It's his birthday today. Can I see?

 What a cute boy! He's handsome. I don't believe that he was ugly. (CHUCKLING) DOCTOR: Do you think about him a lot? (SIGHS) I would like to know where he is. Fucking cunt! They betrayed me! The first person who sees Antin and opens his mouth about this is going to get his asshole blown up with bullets, got it? Do you understand? I can't hear you. Yes. Okay. I'm the only one who speaks to Antin. (CELL PHONE RINGING) Yes? Okay. They're here. Open. DIOS: Take him. Fuck! Those sons of bitches fucked us! They came from everywhere. I told them. I told them it was a trap, right? They didn't listen to me. (MAN YELLS INDISTINCTLY) Fuck! Get out! Let me do it. Come, my brother. Calm down. Relax, brother. That's it. (GROANING) Fernando. What are you saying, Pastor? It's me, Diosito. I'm Miguel. 12 HOURS EARLIER... For this to work out, we need to play the lottery. What's today? September 29th. Gnocchi day. And San Miguel. How do you know? Did you swallow a church calendar? My dad was named Miguel, that's how I know. What time does this need to be finished by? We're leaving when the match starts. I don't know where, do you? No, it's a mystery. Borges is like those technicians, he doesn't confirm the equipment until the last moment. It's not looking right because of this piece of shit vinyl. It is what it is. I'm not getting shit because of this. What a fight with Capece last night. It was good. Be careful with that son of a bitch, he's spiteful. Would you lend us the truck? Look at this, we won't even pass the first checkpoint. Are you crazy? How can I lend you the truck for this? Then we won't be able to leave. ANTIN: We'll figure something else out. Okay. You've got a fresh brain, from the outside. Do you have any ideas? The best way to hide something is to put it in plain view. Like Maradona. What the fuck are you trying to say? It's a nice metaphor, but I don't understand. Can we use the mobile unit? The one from here? Another nut job. (LAUGHS) (MUSIC PLAYING) Could you turn down the volume? (MUSIC FADING) You're quiet today. Eat. Eat while you can, because there won't be anything tonight. We're not going to see each other again. Where are they taking me? Somewhere more comfortable. A house. It'll seem like a five-star hotel after this. You're being strange. What's wrong? Nothing, I'm fine. Here's a present. How nice. See, we can get presents here, too. Did you buy it? No. They teach it here in the workshops. Thank you. Am I going far? Kind of. I trust you. I know you're going to take care of me. You promised me. EMMA: I'm calling because I have some bad news to give you. Carlos wasn't well. He was very depressed and very afraid. Last night, he committed suicide. I have some of his belongings. No, there isn't anything valuable. It's all sentimental. Some pictures, some souvenirs. Okay. You know my number and how to find me. Thank you. She didn't give a shit. She asked if there was anything valuable. When I told her there wasn't, she said that she wasn't interested, as if I was making her an offer. There was a reason he was worried about going back to his sister's house. (SIGHS) Emma, don't be upset. You did everything you could. Hmm? You know that, right? (MAN WHISTLING) Hello. I forgot a few things. I'm going. Hi, how are you? Did you hear what happened? What? Verruga killed himself. Ah. Yes. Yes. It's shitty. Aren't you embarrassed? What? Don't you feel guilty? (SCOFFS) Guilty for what? Because I asked you to speak to him. Lower your voice. Eh? We could have prevented it. You're a fucking son of a bitch. (SCREAMS) Let me go, son of a bitch! Do you want me to hit you? I don't give a shit that you're a woman. Stop! You're going to hit me? Stop it! Go fuck yourself before you hit me. Come here, fucking son of a bitch! You're a piece of shit. Let me go. That's what you are. Everything's fine. Come on. Calm down. We're relaxed. Everything is fine. (CHUCKLES) (SPITS) Son of a bitch. (SHUSHES) Calm down, it's not worth it. (SOBBING) What a gorgeous boy, who is it? Lucas, my grandson. Miguel's son. He lives with Fernando. DOCTOR: With Fernando or Miguel? He lives with Fernando. With the uncle. I'm not that sick. Fernando is your youngest son, right? Do you have a picture of him when he was little? Lovely. How was he? Was he a good boy? No. No? He was a disaster, as a boy and a man. Very jealous of his brother, very insecure. (SIGHS) He became a lawyer. How dumb. Laws are made to be broken. He went to school, Elida. You should be proud of him. Miguel. Miguel is a policeman, like his father. He's street smart. Lucas is a lawyer. No, Lucas is your grandson, Elida. Your son that's a lawyer is Fernando. That's it. Mmm? Where were you here? Do you remember this picture? Fine. That's enough for today, Elida. We'll see each other soon. This whole thing of moving the girl has me stressed. I have a bad feeling. Like when they killed my cousin. Remember, I told you? Yes, of course, I remember. Your cousin Cesar. Yes, Cesar. It'll be good to get out of here for a bit. If it wasn't for Molinari, the bitch. She fucked it up. Don't dwell on that. It's important that you have patience. Antin, too, the cock. Let's rewind. It's understandable that you're nervous about the transfer. Your brother has given you a position with a lot of responsibility. It's something that you've wanted for a while. But maybe you're afraid. You're a little afraid. "Blah, blah, blah." A lot of "blah, blah, blah" today. KALINA: Your brother is starting to listen to you. You wanted Pastor in the group and you got it. You recommended him for this job and your brother agreed. (SIGHS) I don't know about Pastor. What's wrong with him? The guy is weird. He never talks. What kind of friend is guarded like that? He says things that aren't true. He says he doesn't have siblings, then his sister comes to visit. He says he's not part of anything, but he seems like a Mafia guy. You should see him fight. So why did you give him a chance? Because he's smart. We understand each other. Do you think he's using you to get close to your brother? I hope not. I'd like to apologize for what happened earlier with Kalina. I'm sorry. No, it's fine. At least now you're talking to me like a normal person. (CHUCKLES) We should have our third interview today, a bit more formal. You're in no shape to do an interview. Why don't you take the day off? No, don't worry. It would distract me. And, if not, my work will pile up. (SIGHS AND SNIFFLES) Just because Verruga ended up like he did doesn't take him away from God. I know that you cared for him and that this has affected you. He was a good guy. He's with God now. I don't know. I don't believe in God. (CHUCKLES) I'm listening to you and you seem like a different person. Not all of us are what we seem. And what are you? Human. Even though it doesn't look like it, I have feelings. To see someone like Verruga suffering in here upsets me. The other day, you said that nobody here can be rescued. I still think that. So what am I doing here? Or everyone else here who is trying to make things better? Maybe you're naive. You know what's good about you? That you can be around rotten apples without being infected. And that you fight for a world that's a little better inside here. Not everyone does that. Thank you. It helps to hear what you're saying. (SNIFFLES) I heard that you defended Verruga in front of the guard. I wanted to thank you. It's fine. EMMA: No, really. Thank you. He left feeling that there was someone on his side. Does he have family? EMMA: Yes, a sister. She isn't even going to come to claim his body. They're going to bury him in a public grave. As if he never existed, except for me. MIGUEL: Calm down. (SIGHS) Are you a Pisces? Yes, I'm a Pisces. You guessed it. (CHUCKLES) I knew it. Pisces do this to me. On the one hand, they throw me off balance, but on the other, they contain me. (BOTH LAUGH) Is that funny? No! I respect people's beliefs. I'm happy that I don't throw you off balance all of the time. Well. Thanks for containing me and listening to me. We'll have to come back to this. Have you thought about the cells? It's not good for you to stay in the courtyard so long. I haven't thought about it yet. Think about it. Okay. Next week, I have to give my recommendation for where you will go. Okay. Hmm? First your sister, now this. MIGUEL: Huh? You're a Scorpio, not a Pisces. You were born on November 13th. You're right. I lied. Forgive me. It seemed like you wanted me to be a Pisces. I didn't want to contradict you today. I'm sorry. (CHUCKLES) Do we have any news about the judge? It seems like he's softening up. He came to see you. How do you know? I know everything. Get used to it. What did he say? He wants to scare me. He wants to show me that he knows I'm the kidnapper. He came to measure his cock. And whose is bigger? Do you need to ask? Daddy's got the biggest. No, Daddy's got the biggest. I've got two heads on you. I don't think so. (BOTH CHUCKLE) I'm going to make the mobile unit available for the transfer. And I'll make sure you get uniforms. So that there aren't any problems. Don't worry. We've never fucked up a scheme. Stop nagging. Focus on getting the money for the girl. I don't want you to drop any bombs on me. We're going to move the girl. And we're going to give the judge 24 hours. If he doesn't pay, it's done. Here. Here. You know a lot about this. I did a few jobs with long guns. I'm listening. The routes are clear. All of them. The car is ready. The guns are loaded with extra ammunition. The tank is full. Mmm. My dear brother? DIOS: Yes. Everyone gets a cell phone, no Internet or anything. I sent you the numbers in a text. We'll start the transfer in an hour. Good. If no one tries to be a hero, everything should work out perfectly. If anything goes wrong, we throw out the trash and come back home. Good. I need to clarify something for those of you that don't know. This move consists of transferring a person from here, San Onofre, to a cottage in the country. You don't want to know more. When the match starts, the hallways clear. Then we take the girl to the truck and leave. Got it? Is the girl ready? She's nervous, but she'll behave. The clothes look good. That's it, Colombia! You're in charge of the transfer. Okay? Got it. Thanks, Mario. Everything is going to be all right. Today, you'll become a hero. Here are the maps. The information is loaded on the GPS. Right when you get out at the intersection, a car is going to join you and go with you until the end. It's Lagartija's. Calambre, you're going to switch to Lagartija's car. CALAMBRE: Okay. Good. Big Upite is going to take a different route and will arrive at the destination at the same time as you guys. You get there, make the delivery and come back. I'm going to be monitoring from here. I want you to report to me. Please. Report yourselves. You got it? Be alert, we're close to getting the cash. Let's go! (ALL BANGING TABLE) Let's go! What's going on? What are you doing? Relax, baby. We need you to put this on. What are you doing? Put this on and don't make noise. No! Calm down. No! No! Calm down! Let go of me! Calm down, babe! Let go of me! Didn't you talk to her? Luna! Calm down. (HYPERVENTILATING) Calm down! Look at me. We're going somewhere more comfortable, like we talked about. Trust me! Shh. You can trust me. Listen to me. You need to put this on. Okay? Go. (TELEVISION PLAYING) (PHONE LINE RINGING) FERNANDO: (OVER PHONE) Hello? MIGUEL: It's me. We're about to leave to Chascomus. Chascomus. Okay. Do you have the exact address? It's a country house called "La fuga." Wait, let me write it down. MIGUEL: Route 2, mile 76. We'll be there in three hours. Perfect. I'm going to see Mom right now, like you asked. Call Lunati, so he stops fucking around. FERNANDO: He's paying me at 2:00 p.m., and then I'll give him the info. That's what we agreed to. Don't worry, everything is fine. I didn't forget. Happy birthday, brother. We're going to have a stack of cash to celebrate. Listen to me. I'm not doing this for the money. I'm doing it to be free. Get that in your head. Don't worry. (CAR BEEPS) Excuse you. Shit. WOMAN: Organize your things, my love. Organize them. Go find your jacket. Bring a warm jacket. Lucas! (TELEVISION PLAYING) (TRUCK ENGINE RUMBLING) (MUSIC PLAYING OVER STEREO) DIOS: I hope this shit doesn't go off and fuck everything up now. (SNORTS) Do you want some? A little taste? Come on. Stop for a bit, moron. Don't bust my balls. I'm offering you some, I'm not asking for permission. Can't you see we're working and not on vacation? We have to be alert. DIOS: Go fuck yourself. I don't know why you don't like it. It's white as holy bread. It's like going to church. Turn it up. This is messed up. He needs to powder his nose now. He's going to fuck it all up. Are you pissed off because of your outfit? Or is it because I'm in charge? Eh? I'm ordering everyone to stop busting my balls. You could have been in charge, but since you're in love with the girl, you won't see straight. Stop your shit. I see her like a little sister. She's the same age as Mirella. No way she's the same age as Mirella. Mirella, with those tits and huge ass. You should see what a whore his sister is, and how she sucks cock. JAMES: Don't talk about my sister. DIOS: What are you going to do? I'll break your face. You and what army? How much longer? I need the restroom. Don't yell. Take off her headphones so that she doesn't yell. Luna, do you have to go number one or number two? See? Look how the pervert talks to her. What do you want me to say? Do you want to piss or shit? LUNA: Number one. Why don't we stop there? So that she can get out. DIOS: No, we're not stopping. We're in the middle of an operation. Do it here or hold it, I don't know. I'm not going to pee here. Why? Nobody is going to look. Except James, he's a pervert. LUNA: I'm not going to pee here. So stop busting balls. (COUGHING) (CELL PHONE RINGING) Mario. How is everything going? DIOS: Fine. We're close to mile 60. Yes, I'm following you with the tracker. And where are Big Upite and his people? I don't know. I'll call him. (CELL PHONE BEEPS) Where the fuck are you? MAN: We're late. There were some picketers and we had to change course. And why didn't you tell me? You have to keep me up to date with everything. Hurry up. Did you hear? DIOS: Yes, I told you. He's a fat idiot. I said he should take Route 6 and now I don't know which one he took. The asshole messed up. What's up? You're hitting the white stuff hard again? Did you send my brother a message? What the fuck is wrong with you today? I didn't tell anyone anything, I'm not a rat. Go to hell. (LINE BEEPING) (PHONE REDIALING) (CELL PHONE RINGING) Fuck. What now? You hang up on me again, I'll hang you. Do you understand? Sorry. Fucking idiot. Druggy. DIOS: Jerk. Wipe your nose. DIOS: I'm going to take Mirella and put it up her ass. Should we start? ANTIN: Let's start. The criticisms... Your name? Julieta. Okay. Criticisms of the prison system are the main issue when we talk of security. ANTIN: Yes. Like corruption. Hold on. Don't start with corruption. We agreed that we were going to talk about what has improved. JULIETA: Fine. About the services and what needs to be improved, okay? JULIETA: Okay. We can return to the question... Okay. Let's go. Welcome. Did you have a good trip? Who are you? My name is Anabela. Don Gervacio, the landlord, I'm his daughter. My dad went to town to get some provisions. He said that if you want, he'll get some meat and we can put it on the grill. MIGUEL: No, don't worry, we're not staying long. Is it your first time here? Go find a room for the girl. You don't look like the owner's daughter. I'll go with him. He needs a key. Excuse me. Come in. I'm going to check the house. Yes, no problem. Do you live with your father? No, I live in town. In Villa Canas, do you know it? No, I don't. It's nice. Very calm. It's good. Did your dad tell you anything about today? That you're coming from the prison? Yes. Yes. And he left you alone to greet us? That's how we run things. Who are you guys? The house staff. Ah. Is your colleague feeling fine? Yes, why? WOMAN: He seemed a bit nervous. No, he's like that. He has high blood pressure. Don't worry. Okay. I don't like this. No one said anything about a daughter or a guy in a tractor. Why don't we take her to one of our places? MARIO: Everyone has been cleared. But if not, then we don't go through with it. Send me a picture of the girl and I'll show Antin. Barny. Go on. What luck that you're here, Mario. Mario is an inmate... Stop for a bit. Mario Borges is a San Onofre institution. Don't film me. Stop. Don't touch me. Calm down. What are you doing? What the fuck is going on? That's what I'm asking you, what's going on? We have a huge mess, and you're fucking around. Lower your voice. Or I'll lock you up for 20 days. Don't be an idiot. Listen to me. The landlord wasn't there. This girl is saying she's his daughter. That's my country house. Do you know the girl? I don't know, I remember the landlord had a daughter around that age, but... Luna, it's Miguel. I'm a policeman. Don't worry. Where are we? In a country house. Your father knows where you are. They're going to kill me. No. They're gonna kill me. James was weird. No. Yes, I know it. They're going to come get you. They're going to kill me. Relax. Everything is fine. (SHUSHING) Calm down. Be quiet. Listen to me, Luna. Calm down. No one is going to kill you. They are coming to get you. But you need to calm down. You're armed? Go and shoot them all and we'll leave together. Please. I can't. (SHUSHING) Please. Be quiet. Be quiet. Your dad is coming to get you. Hold on. (CONTINUES SHUSHING) Relax. Listen to me, Luna. Stay calm. I'll be back. Stay calm. Don't scream. Please. Relax. DIOS: Tell me who you work for or I'll shoot. JAMES: Calm down. Everything is fine. MAN: We just came here to open the door. (GUN FIRES) Who do you work for? Talk or I'll blow off your ass. Relax, everything is fine. MAN: We came here to open the door. Why isn't there any reception? There was a storm last night. I had reception before. I even sent your picture. Are you cops? We can leave if you want. (MIGUEL YELLING) He's crazy. What's wrong with you? Lunati sent them. I have good intuition. Look, he doesn't look like a gardener. He's not a gardener. He never lifted a shovel in his life. WOMAN: He came to help me. You said he works here, bitch. Calm down. Calm down. Why are you looking at me like that? Are you stupid? Don't you see it's a trap? Calm down. Everything is fine. Barny, go check the back. You, too, Calambre. Come on. Move it! Take these two. Make them talk. Okay. Let's go. Let's go, bitch, move it. Come on, move it. This can't be happening. Everything is going wrong. Everything is fine, Dios. Everything is fine. If we have to shoot, we will. But calm yourself down. Bring it down a bit. Bring it down. Everything is fine. (GASPS) Your friend is really high. Let us go. We just came to help my dad. What time is he coming back? I don't know. Soon. When is soon? WOMAN: When he's done doing groceries. And where does he come in? There or the main entrance? There's only one. MIGUEL: Stop playing dumb with me. I don't believe you. What are you talking about? It's the first time you're in this house. You're paranoid like your friend. You both know who I am. I'm playing on the same side as you. Where is Lunati? I want to talk to him. How do you talk to him? The public has a lot of prejudices when it comes to prisoners and prisons. Indeed. You've spent your whole life dedicated to this. Hmm. What is jail for you? I'm very drawn to the penitentiary system. I believe that a man who has fallen and gets up is much greater than a man who has never fallen. Where is the remote? Turn up the volume. What happened? That's Big Upite's car. We're fucked. LUCRECIA: That's enough for today. Thank you. JULIETA: No, let's keep going. LUCRECIA: No, that's enough for today. LUCRECIA: Let's go, this way. This way. Get me Lunati. Now. Where is Lunati? You know who I am. Where is he? Stop it, Palacios. Lunati sent us. The property is surrounded. Why didn't you wait until we left? There are more guys coming. WOMAN: No one else is coming. Why didn't you say something if you knew it was me? Calm down, you're going to be free soon. Go kill Diosito and the whole gang. You're going to leave us tied up here? Son of a bitch. Turn around. Fucking bitch. Stop talking so much. Everything is going to be fine. You're making everyone nervous. Did they tell you anything? They don't know anything. They work here. You were wrong. Calm down. You're going crazy. I'm crazy? You're a little nervous. Me, too. We're all nervous. They're the housekeepers. You're right. And I beat up the gardener. (GUNSHOTS) Go find the girl so we can go. (GUNSHOTS CONTINUE) (SHRIEKING) (SHUSHING) Luna, these are your father's people. Let's crawl to the bathroom. Get low. (BREATHING RAGGEDLY) (GUNSHOTS CONTINUE) (GUNSHOTS STOP) I'm going to see what's happening. Don't leave me alone, please. I promise nothing is going to happen to you. WOMAN: Palacios. Relax. Don't shoot. There is a car out front. You're a free man. Here is the key. WOMAN: Where is Luna? MIGUEL: In the room in the back. Ahh! (MIGUEL GROANING) (EXCLAIMS) Fucking cunt! They betrayed me! (CELL PHONE RINGING) Yes? Okay. They're here. Open. DIOS: Take him. Fuck! Those sons of bitches fucked us! They came from everywhere. I told them. I told them it was a trap, right? They didn't listen to me. Fuck! Get out! Let me do it. Come, my brother. (GROANING) Calm down. Relax, brother. That's it. Fernando. What are you saying, Pastor? It's me, Diosito. I'm Miguel. Give him to me. (EXCLAIMS) What happened? Nothing. Nothing? Nothing happened. Lunita. As you wish. EL MARGINAL IS A FICTIONAL SHOW.
