 A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Give me a second. Everything okay? Stop, Pastor. Shut your mouth. (GASPS) MAN: Is everything okay? (WHISPERING) You're going to tell them that everything's okay. Yes, everything's fine, thank you. I'm going to let you go now, but you're not going to scream, is that clear?

 Be very careful what you do. Where did you get that photo? The police officer gave it to me. The one that told me about your son. Do you know what he's looking for? Does he know I'm here? No. I told him we said everything we had to say. The photo they sent is from 10 years ago. I'm not Pastor Pena. My name is Miguel Palacios and I'm a cop. I came here under a false identity to investigate the kidnapping of Judge Lunati's daughter. Listen to me. I'm talking to you. (WOMAN 2 CLAPPING)

 I'm sorry, I don't have anything to give you. We didn't come to ask you for anything. What's wrong? You didn't cover your face? Why are you refusing to provide therapy to Diosito? What is this, ladies? "What is this, ladies?" he says. Do you know who I am? Mario Borges' wife. What's your problem with Diosito? Why won't you treat him? Tell me. Come on, tell me. I never talk about my patients with third parties. For that, I'm sorry. Ah, "third parties." He doesn't want to talk with third parties. Motherfucker. (SPRAY CAN HISSING) No! What are you doing? WOMAN 1: I'm going to give you some advice. Look at me. Do you know what you're going to do? You're going to stuff your ass with what Diosito told you about my husband's occupation. Stuff your ass! Don't you know what's going to happen to you? We're going to blow you and your shitty family up. Did you hear me? Motherfucker. Now he understands. WOMAN 2: "Motherfucker." "Motherfucker," he says. Ladies, let's see if we can calm down. We'll "calm down." It doesn't have to be this way. I can report you. Who are you going to denounce us to? I'm shitting myself with laughter. Who are you going to... No one. You're going to stuff your asshole because if you don't, we're going to come and break your face all over again. Do you hear me or not? Now, do you know what you're going to do? You're going to accept Diosito back into therapy. (COUGHS) You know what? You're going to listen to him. And you know what else? You're going to say nice things to him so that he doesn't get depressed because he's a good guy, right? WOMAN 2: Obviously. He's a sweetheart. He's lovely. Do you or do you not understand? Understood? Yes. When he gets depressed, (WOMAN EXCLAIMS) that's when he goes bad. Bye, faggot. (OBJECT CLATTERS) Something fell. Poor thing. You're going to have to... WOMAN 1: I just remembered something else. Do you know what I want? Stop putting ideas in Diosito's mind against my husband. Yes. Family is sacred, right? There you go. I'll comb your hair so you look nice. WOMAN 2: Bye. WOMAN 1: Bye, gorgeous. Fucking faggot. (LAUGHS) Fag. FAG (LATIN MUSIC PLAYING) MAN 1: Ah, we're at the dollhouse. (MAN 2 EXCLAIMING) This is Sandrito, doll, always so cute. Obviously, love, you don't have to stay in hell. I'm going to hell with you. Oh, queer. Do you know what we call Sandrito in our cell block? SANDRITO: Let's see, what do they call me? Coke and wine. Why? Because he'll fuck up your head. (LAUGHS) Liar, Sandrito! Come on, Sandrito. I have something for you. The fasurli is here. Ah, no. Today it's over, no. What do you mean, "it's over"? You can't tell me that. You've brought luck. We couldn't buy another shipment. We're not big shots. Or are we, girls? We're not. Do you know what the shipment's like? Mario gets off his ass and counts out the provisions. It's not my fault. All right, ready. But no other queer is going to come and screw around everywhere. We'll make him eat shit. You calm down, we're in charge, right, girls? Obviously, Daddy. (KISSES) You know what, princess? I'm not showing my face to Mario for anyone. And less for a weirdo like you. So take a walk and show your face before you have to show your ass. Do it, walk. Let's go, Sandrito. I'm waiting here. Do it. Don't worry, I'll finish you off. Let's go. (SNIFFS AND EXHALES) Forgive me. What's wrong? No, nothing. I'm okay. (KALINA SIGHS) Would you leave us alone for a moment? Yes, of course. All right. Excuse me. Excuse me. If you'd like, we can keep talking in a bit. Okay. Dr. Kalina. Yes? How are you? How are you? We met the other day, remember? Of course. You're the auditor. Auditor. Yes, exactly. How's it going? Good. A little bit better than you, I think, at least for today. Ah! No, I had a problem with my car. (CHUCKLES) I was going fast, I had to stop at a corner, I braked suddenly and hit my head on the dashboard. I've already been to the infirmary. I'm fine, don't worry. Are you sure? Yes, yes. You can trust me, if you want. Did you have a problem with the inmates? No, I already told you. I braked suddenly. It was just an accident. You know where to find me. I'll contact you if there's anything. Mmm-hmm. Contact me later. You can trust me. Thank you. Yes. MARIO: What do you mean they don't want anymore? Are you being rehabilitated? I already explained to him. We got off on the wrong foot. What are you up to, Sandro? You're deceiving me. I don't believe anything you say. It's true. We couldn't buy a shipment. We don't have money. You know that I have a talent for weeding out lies. And something smells fishy. If you tell me that you're alone, it's okay, I believe you. But with all those junkies' arms... We already bought some. I swear I didn't agree with it. The others insisted and we bought it. But I didn't want to buy. All right. I like it when you're honest. You know that I appreciate you. You're a cute boy. I wouldn't fuck you in a million years, but you're a cute boy. You're a cute boy! Of course! Let's go. Tell me. Who did they buy it from? From one of the Sub-21 guys. But Mario, please. I don't want any trouble. No, it's okay. Calm down. Nothing will happen to you. But you know it's against the rules to sell drugs in the cell blocks. Aside from me and my associates. And this law applies to buying also. It's as if we received half... What do you mean, half? What the hell are they taking? Don't you know that those assholes cut it? They add glass dust to it. Yes. If it's a matter of price... Sandro, you're the delegate for the girls' cell block. Come talk to Mario. It's much easier. We can give you a good rate, understood? Yes, you're right, Mario. All right. Go tell all those idiots that just this once, everything's okay. It's over. Huh? You'll be punished enough when we take your decorative cop. We don't use him as a decoration, we use him more than you. Yes, you misuse him. Deranged maniac. This is bad. This is bullshit. Bring me Pena, now. Right away, Mario. I'm leaving, Mario. I knew that Lucas was alive. My intuition told me, during my conversation with Lunati. What are you thinking? I don't know. I'm a bit confused, it might be too much information, but... It's okay. Why were you a prisoner before? I had an altercation with a commissioner. I killed him. That's why they threw me off the force. And the business with Lunati? Was that on Borges' orders? I went to find Lunati so that he would give me information. And he tried to kill me. It was him or me. There was no other way. I understand. From what you told me, the guy was a son of a bitch. You still killed him. I'm not asking you to justify it. No. What are we going to do now? You're not going to do anything. No, this is my problem. I want to help you. No. I want to help you find your son and return to your true identity. I'm not interested in being Miguel Palacios so that they can sentence me to 10 more years. The only thing left for me is to escape, get out of here. So why did you come back? If you were out, why didn't you stay out? I'm not done my work here yet. I have one more thing to do. MAN: Excuse me, is everything okay? Yes, we're almost finished. Thank you, Emma. Thank me for what? I have no idea how to help you. No, you're doing a lot for me. Honestly, you're doing a lot. I hope that it's helped to tell someone your story. Yes, a lot. All right, I'm going to leave. Okay. MARIO: Get up, asshole. This isn't a homeless shelter. Don't bust my balls. "Don't bust my balls"? What did you say? What did you say, idiot? Don't bust my balls. If you want to live the good life, then suck it up. I'm not working to support you. Not you, or anyone else works to support me. You don't work directly... Motherfucker, Mario. I don't work? Who maintains the business? I just fought with those idiots outside and now you're giving me shit. Let's go, asshole, get up. Mario, stop. What are you doing, man? Ah, that's right. What are you doing, man? Shithead. I can fuck you up 1,500 times over. You want some more? Geezer, I'll make you shit pineapples. Come and get it, man. Mom's not going to save you now. (BOTH EXCLAIMING) How do you like this? (DIOS GROANING) MARIO: Give up, you old geezer. I can't hear you. Speak up. I'm not giving up, geezer. (GROANS) I give up. (SIGHS) Shithead. What the hell are you doing? (MARIO GRUNTS) MARIO: Nothing that an animal like you would understand. You, drunkard, you have therapy. Your wife is a drunkard. I'm not fucking going. MARIO: Let's go, clown, move it. You can mess around with the psychologist all week long. No, I don't want to. Go, asshole. I don't want to. I don't want to start telling my story from zero all over again. My life is complicated. Don't you understand? Capece. Go, I'm ordering you. Do you hear me? Since when do you care if I go to therapy, Marito? Old geezer. KALINA: Come in. Come in. (CLEARS THROAT) Where's the guy who's going to see me? We're going to continue working together. How's that? I've been thinking, reflecting. I think we should spend some time repairing our relationship. We have worked together a lot, and you have shown a lot of progress. That's what I told you, but you didn't want to continue. Why were you acting like a snob? I just had my doubts. I'm a professional, but I'm also human. There is always an exchange between the psychologist and patient. It's difficult to explain. It doesn't just come. Well, let's try. Dios, don't rush me. This is one of the things we need to change. You see? It's okay, you're right, man. It's okay. Mmm. What happened to your mouth? Did they feed you a gnocchi? No, it was just a small blow. Let's not waste time on that. Tell me what interests you. You see me as an old geezer, too, eh? Same as my brother. Me? No. No? (LAUGHS) Come on, slim, tell me the truth. You see me with this goofy face that doesn't scare anyone. I'm not the bad boy in the movie anymore. What's wrong? Do you want to say something? Stop dancing around it. We made an arrangement that you would manage the courtyard and you're shitting the bed. I'm shitting the bed? More than once. Oh, really? Your neighbors came into the cell block and started selling drugs. In the homosexual cell block. Do I have anything else to say? I didn't know. You didn't know? No. I'm offended that they're selling drugs in the courtyard, because it's also my business, but that they come into the cell block and piss off my customers... Who do they think they are, La Salada vendors? Let me check and I'll get back to you. You're not going to check anything. I will tell you what's happening. You don't have to check anything. (CHAIR THUDS) Business is good, eh? You don't have permission to be anywhere I am. Yeah? Says who? Your mother's ass and your sister's cunt. You can't come in here. You can only come in to eat and shower, on the condition that I'm not here. Understood? You see that guy? He has such a long cock that he uses it as a scarf, and he likes idiots. (FOOD SQUISHING) So if you break the rules, he will destroy your asshole. Now you can eat in peace. Business is good. (MEN LAUGHING) (MEN SHOUTING) (ALL CLAMORING) MARIO: Let him go! Everyone stop. Cut it out! Stop! We promised Antin we weren't going to cause any trouble. Let's keep our word. You're going to pay, faggot. MAN: Get out. Motherfucker. Let's go, cowboys. MAN 2: What a nice table. So, you had a good time with Pastor. You got along well. More than well. I shut that guy's mouth. I proved I can be his best friend. Hmm. And you were alone, Pastor and you. Yes. Us two, alone. Of course. Calm down, we talked about life, chatted a little, drank a bit, listened to music. Do you still have an affinity for him? Much more, now. No, it's okay. We're starting from zero. I have to trust. We weren't alone. I brought some lady friends. It was a huge party. Everyone on each other. What do you mean, "Everyone on each other"? I was with one, I was with another. Pastor with one, Pastor with another. So, really out there. Anything else? No, what are you asking? If I was with Pastor? I don't know. Were you? Just a little kiss. But between friends, it's just a way to solidify the friendship. Of course. Do you kiss all your friends? No. We were there and, poof. "Poof"? Who initiated it? I did. He pretended not to like it. He pretended? Yes. I know that he wants me, but he's playing coy. Of course. (TOY SQUEAKING) Investigate a little further. What are you saying? They're selling drugs inside. They're taking you for a fool. This is a Borges illusion. Borges will come up with similar bullshit just to cause trouble. You don't believe me. Do you know what's happening? Your plan to screw Borges over doesn't exist, buddy. (SHUSHING) Who are you, asshole? Let me give you some advice, then you can do what you want. If you want, get chopped to bits. Okay, then. So what's up? You can't make accusations like this. Do they have a first and last name? If they saw us, they can tell us. Why can't we? Why can't you what? Sell drugs. Are you shitting me, asshole? You were selling drugs, right? Huh? Talk, you motherfucker. Was it you? How did you get it in? My girlfriend brought it in her shoe. Son of a bitch! Why didn't you tell me? They almost killed me because of you. MAN: Stop! Stop what, you fucking fag? Why don't you respect me here? What's up, asshole? Whatever, it's over. Can you tell Borges to come and talk? I'm going to give him all the money. MAN: Hey, you. I have work for you. Don't bust my balls. This is a friendly meeting. I was told you have to come. Let's go. Let go, why are you grabbing me? MAN: Get to work, let's go. All right, stop. I'll come with him. Who are you, the boyfriend? Don't break my balls, I'm coming to help him and that's all. You want to work? Yes, I want to work. Well, come work. (WHISTLING TUNE) Did they fuck you, too? No, asshole, I volunteered. I love to wallow around in shit. (LAUGHS) Stop protesting and get to work. MAN: Take it, Pastor. Come on, let's go. Come on, boy, move your ass. You like bitch work? Yes, let's go. Look what I have here. Stop, you turkeys. We're going to be at this all day. I know how it works. We have to unclog it. Pena! Go with him. Let's go, let's go. Stop. I'm staying alone. All right. Get to work. Get to work? You get to work. MAN: Shut your asshole and get to work. You're being a smartass, eh? CESAR: "Shut your mouth and work," says the punk. Take a look. Ah, these guys. (WATER SPLASHING) There's not even a coin. What's up, asshole? (GRUNTING AND GROANING) What are you looking at? Let go! (YELLING) That doesn't hurt, fags. (GROANING) (PANTING) Take a look up there, behind those boxes. Last time I found it around there. No, it's not here. You'll be the whore of San Onofre. Suck it, faggot! MASKED MAN 1: Slumdog. Let me go, fag. Watch yourself. Faggot, watch yourself. (SHOUTING) Watch yourself, fag! No! (CESAR GROANING) Look what I found here. Take a look back there. Go through the bags, or you won't see it. It's not here. There's nothing here. It has to be there. It's always there. (CESAR GROANING) CESAR: No! No! Help me look. Stay a moment. PASTOR: It's not here. It's okay. Go. Leave me alone to work. Just go. (CRYING) (SOBBING) Yes, Mudo, everything's ready. Open up. They're opening it. MARIO: That's how it's done, Mudo. Marito. Take everyone with you. And grab a few beers. I don't want anyone here. I want to be alone. MAN: Hurry up! You're getting paid. Go have a drink with the guys. And when you hear from me, take the car and set it on fire. (LAUGHING) (YELLING) Borges, you're a genius. PASTOR: Son of a bitch! Hey! (SOBBING) (WHIMPERS) Shh! What happened? What's wrong? Motherfucker. Fuck! What happened? What happened? Who got you? (SOBBING) I don't know. (SHUSHING) What happened? Get out, you. Stop, let me help. Get out or I'll hurt you! Get out right now. Who hit you? Who got you? I don't know. (WHIMPERING) Don't say anything, please. Don't worry, I won't say anything. Don't worry. Shh! Calm down, you idiot. (SOBBING) Please. What happened? I see that they opened all the pipes. What are you doing? Fuck off, Pena! PASTOR: Come, come. (CLICKING MOUSE) (INDISTINCT TALKING ON TV) EDUCATIONAL TOYS (CELL PHONE CHIMING) Hello? ARIEL: How are you, sweetie? Great, and you? You weren't asleep, were you? No, I was working on this. It's okay. Any news? No, tomorrow I'm going to see if there's any new information, I hope. Hmm. If not, it's okay. She's much calmer. Good, that's better. Listen, sorry to change the subject, but would you like to grab a drink? Now? Yes, but I didn't know you went to bed so early. What do you think about dinner and dancing on Friday? You like to dance, no? I don't want to be a bad sport, but this is not a good time. There's nothing too complicated for me. Tell me your problem and I'll help. You'd like that? For me to tell you my problem? (CHUCKLES) Okay, if you want, I'll tell you. I'm pregnant. Are you serious? Or is this a joke? No, seriously. I don't care either way. We can still go out. Uh... Yes, why not? Let's have some fun. Mmm-hmm. You're going to have the baby alone? Yes, alone. Well, maybe I'll find someone who wants to be the father. Yes, of course. They're calling me back to work. I'll text you and we'll arrange something? Okay, sounds good. Kisses, bye. (KEYPAD BEEPING) (MUSIC PLAYING) I was washing the showers when two guys suddenly walked in. MAN: Did you see who they were? I couldn't see well because they had their faces covered. But there's one that I'll never forget. He's here, man. The giant that was in the dining room with us. I see that they opened all the pipes. Hey, buddy, don't touch me. Can't you see that I'm okay? A couple of fruitcakes hit me, is all. Don't exaggerate. Leave it. Luckily, Pastor showed up. Someone dropped this during the fight. Let's see? Give it to me, cowboy. "PD." What is this shit? Does anyone know who this is? No idea. Pedro. Pablo. Pastor! That's the least of it. We all have nicknames here. We'll have to really investigate. We know that Rico was the one who cleared the shower area, and that's why those guys could get in. Ramallo was the one who came for you. Yes, but that doesn't mean he's involved. Whoever did this to me is going to pay. All of them. Rico, the giant from the dining room, that fucking son of a bitch. The guy with the chain, and the other one we haven't identified. The Borgeses are going to pay for this. All of them, their entire gang. Any breathing Borges is a Borges who will die. We are Sub-21. If they touch any of us, we jump them all, right? There were three of them, and I was alone. I'm not going to let this go. I got off easy. It could have been worse. Calm down, my friend. What goes around comes around. Go, leave me alone, please. Go! Go fuck yourself, asshole! Get going. Go! (SLAMS) (GRUNTING AND SLAMMING) ...and understand that the harmony that the prison family we maintain in San Onofre is built upon the foundation of the happiness of our staff. Write that. Happy staff means happy inmates. I'm saying that any... It's a mess. I'm confused. What I want to say is, the prisoner, the inmate, should be... He should trust the guards, should be respected, blah, blah, blah. Yoo-hoo! Hey! You look beautiful. What are you up to? You like it? (CHUCKLES) Yes. I have something. Don't worry, I don't like anyone from work. You said it. I didn't say anything. I'm listening to you. I have to aim higher. (LAUGHS) You're terrible. Excuse me. I'm informing you that there's going to be maintenance work outside. Some inmates will be coming to sand and paint, so there will be noise. That's fine. Have you determined the list of inmates? I would like to suggest someone. Tell me. Pastor Pena. He's a good carpenter and he would do a good job. Whatever you say. I think he's a son of a bitch, but if you say so. Yes, I do say so. I can't stand that guy. You still think you can't be with any inmate? Of course, girl. It's my job to make them feel good. You're going to come along. Mmm. What? (HUMMING) (SIGHS) You're an idiot. (CLIPPERS BUZZING) Ready, Daddy. If we don't make you a champ with this... (INDISTINCT SINGING) Go on. Enjoy, bye. Come, let's have a chat. Why is there such a problem with your badge, if you're always here? And when you are able... Pastor Pena, have you gone crazy? Son of a bitch. Did you make Cesar's bed in the shower? Stop. What are you talking about? Stop. Have you... You were distracting me. You took me to the storeroom and you wasted my time while they beat him. Stop, asshole! How? I'm on your side. (GROANS) (GRUNTS) You have 24 hours to get out of the courtyard. Understood? Stop! You're going to another block cell or another prison. Is that clear? You can't say that to me. Calm down, tell me what I did. I already explained. I'm really going to throw you to the wolves. They're going to fuck you raw. I didn't betray you, Pastor. Shut your mouth. Don't play stupid. And be careful about telling Borges, because Sub-21 is in all the prisons. Understood? (EXHALES) (SCRATCHING) What are you doing with the sandpaper? Hey. What are you doing with the sandpaper? We have to chip at the wall. Understand? Who sent you to work here? You've never done this in your life. Sandpaper doesn't work on damp walls. You don't understand shit. I don't understand what you want. You have to chip at it... Chip at it, and we'll see. Everything okay? How are you? Yes, here fighting with the wall. Did you ask me to come here? Yes. Don't tell me it's going badly, I told Capece you knew the work. Hmm. I thought it'd be a good way for you to keep on top of any news. Thanks. I've been thinking a lot about the other day. Thank you. I have to ask you a favor, Emma. I know I've already asked for a lot, but my mother's out there, and now that my brother's gone, I don't know who to go to. My mother's been committed. Why? What's wrong? She has advanced Alzheimer's. I know I've already asked for a lot, but if you could go see her, it would do me a lot of good. Excuse me for interrupting. Can we talk a moment? Yes, yes, let's go. No problem. See you later, yes? CAPECE: She's pretty, eh? She's pretty. You know what? Something crazy happened. My brother asked her out yesterday, and she told him she was pregnant. Do you think it's true, or is she full of it? I don't know. I know that I acted like an ass when you told me about the pregnancy. But the truth is, we're going to have a child. And I want to know what we're going to do. We're not doing anything together. I made my decision, and I told you. And now you have time to think and decide what you're going to do. GASTON: I thought about it. I want a smoother relationship. I want to live together, and start a family. I love you, Emma. And you know it. But I need time for this. Stop, Gaston. I need a bit of time. Stop, please. We've been over this a million times. I don't want to wait anymore. I need to move on with my life. I'm asking you as a favor. Don't tell me that. There it is. CESAR: What's going on here? What's up? Everything okay? Everything cool? Oh, jewelry. Better that way. Get to work. What's happening here? MAN: Cesar. They gave me a list of PDs. I think it has to be Pablo Diaz. He was friends with the giant. Perfect. Well done. I'll get on it. What's going on here? Did you come to gossip? Or did you come to join Sub-21? I can't hear you. Talk louder. (MEN MURMURING) Then get to work. Let's go. They seem stupid, brother. You have to keep telling them things. What are you doing, buddy? Everything okay? Hey, it turned out well, eh? They're nice, cowboy. Did you see? Hey, man, sorry. I didn't know you'd get in trouble because of me. Sorry. It's fine, but next time don't do it alone. Because you're not alone. It's fine. All right. They're yours. It's a present. CESAR: Okay, thanks. What's up, Susto? I have a couple of Don Torcuato's friends. They're thugs. They want to make trouble with us. Oh, yeah? They say that Borges' son-in-law is there. Another party that'll get crazy and ruin some cowboys. Come in, Pena. Sit down. Go on, stay outside. (DOOR CLOSES) I asked them to call you, because it's a mess down below. The atmosphere is fucking tense. What's going on? Borges cleared out the shower so they could fuck Cesar up. Is Cesar that loser with Sub-21? Hmm. This is going to end in disaster. So help me stop it. I can't stop it. Did he get hard? I don't know. What about the other issue? What issue? Lunati. No one saw me, I told you. I don't believe you. When someone's doing my bidding, I assume they might want to screw me. You weren't caught, but I had taken precautions. It's strange that you haven't at least tried. I know that you're not a sucker. If I tried anything, you'd have me killed. Don't doubt it. I still don't believe you. (MOANING) (BOTH PANTING) (WOMAN MOANING) Excuse me. (CLEARS THROAT) I'm sorry, I didn't see anything. Emma! (INDISTINCT CHATTER) DIOS: How are you, children? This is how I like it, all lined up, coming for food. This shitty food they dig out of the garbage. (MAN LAUGHING) DIOS: Go back to the slum, man. (INDISTINCT CHATTER ON TV) What are you looking at? Look, Cesar, the dude from the fight I told you about. He fights just like me, asshole. (LAUGHING) (TV CHANNEL CHANGES) (TUTTING) We have to beat the shit out of them. Calm down. Whoever gets angry, loses. We have to wait for our moment. But there won't be much time. SUSTO: I have a couple of Don Torcuato's friends. They're thugs. They want to make trouble with us. MAN 2: They say that Borges' son-in-law is there. MAXIMUM SECURITY PENITENTIARY, DON TORCUATO, BUENOS AIRES (POP MUSIC PLAYING OVER HEADPHONES) This is for Cesar. MAN: Let me go, you son of a bitch! Take that, motherfucker. Take it. Cut everything, motherfucker. Do you like that, you son of a bitch? Come on. (CLIPPERS BUZZING) (ELECTRICITY BUZZING) (MUSIC CONTINUES) (THEME SONG PLAYING) EL MARGINAL IS A FICTIONAL SHOW. ANY RESEMBLANCE TO EXISTING EVENTS, CHARACTERS, NAMES AND/OR CIRCUMSTANCES IS PURELY COINCIDENTAL.
