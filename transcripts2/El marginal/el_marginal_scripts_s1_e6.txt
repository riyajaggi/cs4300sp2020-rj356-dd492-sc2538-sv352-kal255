 A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES MIGUEL: The theory is that they were trying to settle scores. They were both killed at the same time. Fernando Palacios was stabbed to death outside the door of the nursing home where his mother was staying. He died in her arms. Twenty blocks from there, his wife Betina was shot inside her home. Lucas! The family was about to set out on a trip. They might have been running away.

 Lucas Palacios, nephew of the murdered couple, is still missing. The police are searching. 48 HOURS EARLIER... Does it hurt? What's going on, asshole? Do you want me to beat the shit out of you again? Sooner or later, I'll get my revenge. The hospital sent this. It's for the drugs. Okay. Come later and we'll check your bandages. (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) Brother, welcome home. You only have seven lives. Stop. Did you spit up the bullet?

 No. They left it inside in the end. They say it's not worth taking it out. You won't get past the detectors anymore. This idiot doesn't believe me. Tell him who saved your life. He says it was like Bruce Willis. It's true, he saved me. See? I don't lie. I saw that it was a trap. They would have killed us all. Coke makes you grow balls. It was all a big fuckup, right? But you have your reward now. Now you can come to our cell block. With you? No, I'm going to the courtyard. Are you dissing me? No. Are we friends, or not? I have to be with the guys. You can manage the place from the cell blocks. No, I need to be here for the business. Seriously. Marito told me he needs to speak with you now. Why? He doesn't let me lie, I have nothing to do with what was decided. Oh, no, is that true? It's true. I don't understand anything. Things you guys decided. Marito will tell you. I have nothing to do with it. EMMA: Good morning. Hi, good morning. Sorry for invading your territory. I had to come to this bathroom because in ours, the one for security guards, there is no hot water. No problem. Is everything okay? Yes, I'm having a great time. What's up? No hot water in your house either? You're such a bitch. (CHUCKLES) My wife pulled out the red card. I wasn't going to go to a hotel or to my brother's, so I came to the office. What happened? What did you do? ANTIN: Nothing, stupid stuff. At least before, we used to enjoy making up. Not anymore. (CHUCKLES) Bye. ANTIN: Bye. Man. I was looking for you. Any news? Everything's good. I have a good feeling, let's play pool. What's the separation number? There is no number. What do you mean, no number? I'll give you number 17, the misfortune. No, not the misfortune. I have the opposite going on. So let's go to the lawsuits, number 78, the prostitute. ANTIN: Son of a bitch. No, he doesn't stop. Play 100 pesos on double zero. I'm just about done with you. With this, you owe me 370 pesos. Come to my office whenever. Mario. What are you doing? What are you doing here? Where are you coming from? Last night, the guys were having a party, watching TV and listening to loud music. Big party. I didn't want to be the old jerk, so I came to sleep here. Where they screw the slackers. At least they screw. How is it going at home? Why are you lying to me? The guys told me what you did last night. What did they say? You're doing a transvestite. Ah. Are you in love? Yes. That's good. Enjoy. Is your family visiting? Yes, they come all the time. Seriously? Hmm. I received the visitation records. So you know. Yes, I know. I was asking to see if you wanted to tell me. I didn't realize. I'm not that clever. What's going on? It's been a while since they've come to visit. Are you calling them? MAN: Yes. But it's worse outside than it is here. EMMA: What do you mean? My mom is a mess. My brothers are wherever. They left school, they sell coke. My mom found out and told them to stop messing around. But the bastards won't do anything about it. Plus, they are in trouble with the police. My mom is caught in the middle. Do you have a father? He died when we were kids. Does your mom have a job? She cleans houses. She can't make ends meet. And now she's got the twins. That's why she doesn't come. You can help them, even from here. Not just from a financial point of view, but you can support them, too. Even if they can't come, you can call them on the phone. Yes, I know. You're an important part of the family. Let's see if I finish school before my brothers. (CHUCKLING) Right? You'll be an example to follow. I know people who work in your neighborhood. I'm going to speak with them and see if they can help. Good. You're so sweet. (CHUCKLES) Hello. Hello. Welcome. Again. How are you? How are you feeling? Good. EMMA: What are the doctors saying? MIGUEL: I'm going to be okay. Just a bit of pain. The bullet is still encapsulated, but it's nothing more than that. Hmm. Have you spoken with your lawyer? My lawyer? Mmm-hmm. No. He's traveling. Why? To see what he says. I can let him know they discharged you. What's his name? Fernando Palacios. Fernando Palacios... Do you know when he's back? No. Maybe you could speak with someone from the legal department until he's back. I don't get what you are talking about. They can give you life, Pastor. You killed another inmate. It's very serious. Who did I kill? What do you mean, who? Morcilla. Taking the blame for Morcilla's death is a sacrifice, but you're doing me a big favor. You're an important part of the gang. You won it in your own right. For how you reacted during this operation. When you are part of a family, you need to think about all the members. In this case, it was about covering me up. They can't give me more years, I'm almost there. I haven't got long before I can get out. Whereas you fucked up big. You blew people up. I didn't check with you because you were taken in. We needed to make a fast decision. Do you get we are grateful? I do. There will be a big financial compensation. No joke. There will be money. What a fuckup with the chick. We got done. What's strange is that I only gave out directions to the place a few minutes before I left. Did you see anything suspect? No. Jesus was betrayed, but they won't screw me. The difference is that I'll find out who it was soon enough. And when I do, I'm going to grab him and hang him by the balls. Try not to do it here so you don't have to put another corpse on Pastor's account. A bit resentful, Pastor? No, Mario. All good. MAN: The attorney doesn't have any objection against Somoza's file. So? We understand that the inmate went through a crisis before getting released and took his life. ANTIN: Exactly. But the escape of Gustavo Sosa is difficult to believe. Regarding Sosa, I passed on the conduct issue to the judge on duty. I asked for an administrative summary. What about the fight that killed one inmate and left another wounded? I wonder if you think it's normal to find weapons in a prison. If it was normal, we wouldn't have just one wounded in two years. We'd have 10 murders a day. It was clearly an isolated case. Your attitude is not helping. You should pretend you care about the audit. I care about the audit, I'm an honest official. Of all the old prison's employees, I'm the one that best applies the new penitentiary techniques. We are in an overpopulated prison, not with inmates. Overpopulated with painting masters, therapists, social workers, social therapists, psychiatrists. I'm from the old generation. When we didn't use to call prisoners "inmates." We used to hit them with sticks. We had to adapt to the human rights, tread carefully, tap on the bottom. The inmates go from one workshop to another, while I'm here for 14 hours a day trying to solve the messes they create. Let's call a spade a spade. It's not a school or a kindergarten, it's a human jail. Here, we lock up the worst of society. The biggest sons of bitches. They beat the shit out of each other, so sometimes you run into problems. What are you doing here? Eh? Weren't you in the pricks' cell block? Who told you that? I'm here. Good here. He's in the slum. What's going on? How are you doing? Did you blame Morcilla? Tell. There's nothing to tell. Where did Morcilla find the weapon he shot you with? I don't know. What happened to my stuff? Don't look at me. They came to steal them. I listened to you. We're not some rats. Here is your stuff. We kept it for you. And we cleaned your room. There was a lot of tomato sauce. WOMAN: (OVER VOICEMAIL) Please leave a message after the tone. When you finish, you can select more options. Fernando, it's me. You must still be traveling. Don't come back. The transfer was a disaster. Lunati fucked us up, he tried to kill me. This son of a bitch won't stop until we're out of his way. Be careful, Fernando. Look after your family. Be careful with Lucas. Send me a message so I can relax. MARIO: When I was young, I was unstoppable. Not even when I ended up in jail for the first time were they able to stop me. The first thing I did was sign up for a carpentry workshop. With your dad. Your dad and I made a motherfucking wardrobe. We made a double back, we got inside and we escaped. I don't believe you. Bet on it! My old man told me. It's in my house. Don't be a dick, of course he did. (LAPTOP BEEPING) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) The party is over. Everybody out. I need a private meeting. Let's go. Go. You, too. I said private. I have to go as well? Move! I said private. What the fuck do you want, Lunati? To see how life is, Borges. Sometimes you think you have it all figured out. Then someone way cleverer comes around and leaves you empty-handed. Why the fuck are you calling me? Aren't we even? We might be. I was looking at photos of friends of yours so as to keep a record of the number of people you fucked over. Do you remember this one? Does that ring a bell? Sosa. He's stiff in the ground. The country house in Chascomus was left in a mess. You'll have to give good money to whoever lent it to you. What matters is that Lunita is safe and sound. With me. How did you find out about the transfer? I know you're wondering. I have a little bird that keeps me informed. It hovers over you. Then I'll have to take care of that. (CELL PHONE RINGING) Wait a minute, I have a phone call. (BEEPS) Hello. It's me, Palacios. Miguel, how are you? I was talking with a friend of yours. Coincidences are unbelievable, Marito. You know that one. If you walk down the penitentiary, you'll bump into him. You should listen to his voice. I'm going to put on the speakers. Talk, Miguelito. Never mind. You'll bump into him. That smile won't last long. The only one who'll be empty-handed is you. Yes, I'm very scared. I'm going to leave you now, I need the bathroom. I'm shitting myself. Bye, Lunati. How was your meeting with Antin? Predictable. I told him about the suspicions we have regarding the proxy and he went on and on about the old-school way. Did he say anything about Sosa's supposed escape? Nothing useful. I think the same as you, the guy left to commit a theft and never came back. Thank you. If Sosa's wife is as unwell as you say, he's probably dead. Yes. What about the other case? Today the wounded inmate came back. Pastor Pena. But it's weird. When we talked about the death of the other inmate, he reacted as if he didn't know. Hmm. Right. Should we talk about what matters? Look at me, Emma. Why aren't you answering my messages? Because we said we wouldn't talk. Only about work. (SIGHS) It's hard for me. I miss you. A lot. How are your kids? You want to know how my kids are? Yes. Good. They're good. Getting in trouble, as always. In school now. (CHUCKLES) I'm glad. If you are this happy on your own... I can leave if you want. DOCTOR: It's healing well. I'm going to clean it anyway. It might sting a bit. MYSTERIOUS HOMICIDE Raise the volume, please. REPORTER: One week after the violent murder of lawyer Fernando Palacios and his wife, PALACIOS MURDER the whereabouts of little Lucas Palacios, the couple's nephew, are still a mystery. The victims' family is at the morgue to check if the body found on the bank of the Soldati River could be the child. What's the chick saying? Move over. Dance. What are you doing? What's going on? Why don't you fuck off? I'm not in the mood. I'm not just anyone, I'm your savior. You must love telling the story. Come on, smile. What's your problem? DIOS: Are you talking to me? Yes, to you. I'm going to fuck you up. Are you being a smartass? Let's see what you've got. Give it to him, son of a bitch. For fuck's sake, stop! Stop! What's going on here? It's not worth it, stop. Who isn't worth it? I'm not worth it? You're defending a guy who's pissing me off, playing his representative. You gang up with these morons, don't come to me later. Go fuck yourself. MAN: What a dick. Stop. In the end, Pastor turned out to be an idiot. He only just got here and he already thinks he is a star. I think I made a mistake with him. I defended him against everything, but when it was his turn, nothing. Hmm. You risked your life for him, and now you expect the same from him. I saved his life, that idiot was dead. How do you think he should pay you back? I don't know. Being... More affectionate. I didn't become a whore. But if they come to hit you and I do nothing, then I'm not showing you affection. Friends are the same to me as chicks. I like those who ignore me. It's not the first time you've expressed doubts about Pastor. The other day, you said you saw him fight and he looked like he's had training. Which made you doubt what he said about his family. Do you know what I'm thinking? You are trying to make me think about Pastor. Are you trying to make Pastor look like the bad guy? You won't stop until I say it. Look. You brought up the subject and you talked about your trust. You said you felt betrayed. What betrayal? I didn't say that. You're the one saying it. You're talking bullshit. It'd be convenient for you if I thought Pastor took the details to Lunati. The only one who knew about that was you. How much did they pay you, son of a bitch? See, now you're paranoid. Now I'm paranoid? Now I'm paranoid? Yes. And I wasn't before? No, yeah, this has been getting really complicated lately. It's really difficult to understand you. What you need to know is that what is said here, stays here. Client confidentiality. How is the wound? All right. I have bad news. Your lawyer is not traveling. You couldn't reach him because there's been an incident. He and his wife were killed. I heard the news. Did you know him well? MIGUEL: I did. I'm very sorry. What happened is awful. They can't find the kid now. He's not their son, his name is Lucas. They were only looking after him. We should contact a defense attorney. Unless you have another lawyer we could call. I haven't thought about it. I understand. We need to think about it. You can't turn up at the hearing with a lawyer who doesn't know you. (CELL PHONE RINGING) Excuse me. (BEEPS) Hello. Hello, Emma. Did you talk to Sosa's wife? Yes, she's on her way. Try to convince her to file a complaint. Give her my number. That's what I was planning to do. I'll let you know later. Emma, how about I stop by your house so we can talk? I'm sorry. To be honest, I don't think it's a good idea. (CELL PHONE BEEPING) WOMAN: Hello. I need to speak with Mrs. Graciela. She can't talk right now. Who's speaking? A family friend. It's important, I need to talk to her. I'm Graciela's daughter. Is it the press? I'm not a journalist. I'm Miguel Palacios, Fernando's brother. I just found out what happened. I need to know where my son is. You remembered your son a little late, don't you think? I don't know what you and your brother did for this to happen. Because of that son of a bitch, we lost Betina. Your son is probably dead, but if he isn't, I'm going to pray no one finds him. Everything the Palacios brothers touch turns into shit. MAN: Pastor. Are you there? Eh? Yes, what do you want? Mario wants to talk to you. Tell him I can't. Say you couldn't find me. I don't like lying. Tell him you found me but I couldn't go. I'm busy. Seriously? Yes, seriously. Tell him whatever you want. I can't go now. I can confirm that your husband isn't in any hospital. In the prison, there is no transfer or illness report. Did the director lie to me? Could my husband be dead? I don't know. They say he escaped. I've been talking with the attorneys. They want to help you. If you want, they need a family member to file a complaint so things can move faster. How much is that going to cost me? I've got no money. Nothing. Don't worry. I'm going to put you in touch with them. He left with another woman. Mmm? He left with another woman. Do you think so? No. No. Gustavo would never do that to me. No. It was my son's birthday on Saturday. If he had run away, he would have done anything to come. Exactly. I need to go back to work. But with your authorization, I'm going to pass on your contact details. Gaston Belardo is going to call you. I trust him. He's a good guy. He'll do everything to help you. Belardo? Yes. Anything else I can help you with? No. Do you need money? No, don't worry. If you have any information that can help the investigation, please call me. Don't talk about this to anyone. Not that your husband is missing, not that I have information. See you. I knitted this for him. Did you? I knitted this. Look who's here. My cousin Adriana. How are you? Good work taking the blame for Morcilla's death. Good work. That's how you do it. Why did you want to see me? I need to get out. I need to fix something. I can be back in 24 hours. You have my word. Leave the prison? Yes. (CHUCKLES) Did the bullet affect your head? Come out? Do you think you can just leave like that? Tell me why you need to leave. I need to settle a score. Do you have to kill someone? Yes. Where are you going? Don't touch. Leave the vitamins, they are mine. Seriously, is that for me? You won it by closing my asshole. In the end, you can always trust your blood. Did you see? Diosito knows. Diosito knows. If you had trusted me from the beginning, we would have gotten the money back. Grow up now, idiot. Stop, don't kill the messenger. Please. What's going on? Pastor says he can't come. He's busy. Oh, all right. He has an important social life. This is your friend. My friend, my ass. He's getting too comfortable. You open the door for them, you open your heart, and that's how they thank you. I don't even trust my own shadow now. I only trust our blood. Thank you. MARIO: Messenger, my ass. DIOS: Cunt, take this. (LAUGHS) I told you to take it easy with the vitamins. Spit it. Have you evaluated the risk of coming to see me with no middleman? I don't want a middleman, this is important. I prefer talking directly to you. Look. In the wild, scavengers know intuitively that the animal is going to die before the animal itself. Before the lion, they know the lion is going to die. They start hovering. Just like hyenas, they have that sense, too. They wait patiently, and when the lion dies, they are the first to attack and have a feast. The ones with a lot of jail experience can see that in the penitentiary life, the cycle repeats itself. Lions, hyenas and scavengers come and go. What I means is, I adore Borges, but Borges' end of cycle is right here. I mean, I'll help you, I'll let you get out for 24 hours so you can do what you need to do, and you help me initiate Borges' end of cycle. All right? Yes. How are you, honey? Here, fighting. Yes? Yes. What about Diosito? Hanging around. How are you? I have a stiff neck that is driving me crazy. Listen to me. What the hell happened with Lunati? So much time wasted, and in the end, he fucks us over. What I said on the phone, Gladys. I don't have any more news. I don't know more. Are you going to leave it like that? They're bullshitting you! Stop. Stop telling me off. Stop now. Can't you see they won't respect me here? I'm going to punch you. Give me pie. That one here won't reveal the secret to preparing quince. What are you saying? I told you how to, step by step. It never works. It never works. I was with my cousin in the bar around the corner, but she's not here yet. What cousin? Adriana? Huh. What was she doing in the bar? What do I know? But Sosa is not here. What did she come here for? What do you mean, Sosa is not here? Did you do something to him? Stop. Sosa is gone. He left for business and never came back. Sometimes she stays alone with the kids. I'll give you some cash for her so she keeps quiet. Tell her we'll make sure she has all she needs, as will her kids. We'll take care of it. I'm going to ask you something. Don't say anything. Not you, not her. You are both chatterboxes. I want you to keep this a secret. Do you hear me? Yes. Do you hear me? Yes, I heard you. Pastor. Take this. The Borges are sending this to you. So you can take it into account. That's the list of goods that came in today. Mario says it's a form of payment. A deposit for your agreement. Take the key to the storage unit. Let me know if you need help. I always used to help Morcilla. I can tell you who pays straight away, who is going to rip you off. I don't need anything, thank you. What are you doing? (ALL LAUGHING) Not for you. Cesar. How are you? All good? What's up? Everything in order. Taste it. That's so good. What are you doing with that key? It's the key for the storage unit. Look at you. Don't get weird like the fat one. Give us a discount. (ALL LAUGHING) What are you doing? He's a friend. There you go. When some gather more than they need, others receive less than they deserve. Share it. CAESAR: What's your deal? Have you got a fever? All I'm asking is that you be fair to everyone in the courtyard. Is this a trick? No. What's there is mine. It's going to rot. So be it. DIOS: Come on. We are anxious to know. (RAP MUSIC PLAYING OVER RADIO) Abstinence is killing us. Here it is! We need to do some quality control. (SNORTS) Pass. Nothing special. Good. This way you won't take it all and we can share it. You want to take it all. Your brother? With the wife. What's up? There's a fight. The guys from Sub-21 are sharing out our stuff. The goods? They must have blown up the storage unit like with Morcilla. Fucking slum dogs. I'll deal with that. Stop. Let's talk with Mario first. He's busy, didn't you hear? (ALL CHEERING AND SINGING) Share it. Share it, fool. For you, take it. Thank you. Take it, the courtyard is ours. Don't come back. What's going on? Do you want things for free? (CAESAR EXCLAIMING) What's up? The beating in the bathroom wasn't enough? I'm coming after you. What are you doing? (ALL YELLING) Hit him, come on. Come on, here. Come on, get up. (GUNSHOT) Not with my family, cunt. This prison is mine, son of a bitch. (GUNSHOT) GUARD: On the ground. GUARD: On the ground, pieces of shit. Down. Head down. Let's go. Son of a bitch. GUARD: Head down, come on. This prison is mine, didn't you know? Head down, Borges. (LAUGHING) We need to get him an ambulance. Don't bust my balls. I'll let you know. He has a deep stab, he's going to die on us here. What a shit day. I haven't gotten a cut like this since the '90s. What a shitty era. As if we didn't have enough with the attorneys who won't leave me alone. You guys start a massive fight, with a fire no less. It was a little flame, nothing more. Shut up, idiot. What's up with you? Are you old? You can't even control your own people? I can't let anyone steal my stuff. The goods were Pena's, he shared them out with the guys in the courtyard. And you had to get in the mess. You jumped right in it. And you forced me to take drastic measures. Can we talk alone? Fine, whatever. Stop fagging out on me. Do you know The Flintstones, Colombia? I don't know them. You didn't have it there? Shout at me again in front of my people, and I'll make a mess that won't leave you with a single inmate alive. Are you threatening me? I'm threatening you. Do you want me to send that to you in a handwritten letter? Why don't you suck my balls? Why don't you put yourself in my shoes? I have enough on my plate. In your place, I wouldn't even bother. My business is elsewhere. Let's end with this, okay? Friends like always. But if you want to show off, scream at your people. Go on. Come in. Come in. Sit down here. I called you because I wanted to clear up a few things. Tell me. I've been working here for a long time. I've met all kinds of inmates. Guilty people, innocent people. People who regret what they did, people who don't. I have a lot of experience, even though you underestimate me. I don't. Just looking at you, I can tell you are hiding something. I don't know what you're talking about. The lawyer affair is affecting you more than it should. What would be normal? You have more information than what you say. I would like to remind you that we have a kid's life at stake. If you know something, say it. I don't know what you are talking about. You used my computer. I saw the history. I saw you looked for info about the wife's relatives. Why? You can trust me. Everything you say will stay between us. I promise. No. Listen. I promise that whatever you say will stay between us. I can help you. Seriously. (CLANGING) (EL ENANO SINGING) Let's go, girls. To the nurse's office. Of course. The VIP first and then us. MAN: Fuck it. Suck my balls. Stay here if you want. All right, we'll take it. Leave us alone, we are fine like this. Leave, go. As you wish. Who do they think we are? I'm laughing at you. Look how they charged. I have nothing. (LAUGHING) That was a big mess. Are you all right? Yes, I'm good. You put your hands on a few things. I saw you grab a few things. No, but... I have nothing to do with the guys. I made the most of the mess. Of course. Seriously. I'm a nobody. The kids are involving me less every time. The courtyard now is a mess. Before, with Morcilla, we used to be better. Now there is Pastor. Yes, Pastor is a good guy, he's my friend. But, in the end, he's too distracted. He's somewhere else. I don't know what's up with him. The kids are not stupid. They notice and they take advantage. I could collaborate with Pastor for whatever is missing. For you, out of respect for you and your brother. Are you switching gangs? Why are you busting my balls? I'm only chatting. Do you want more trouble? Huh? Do you want to go back to the nurse? Your mom will go back to the nurse. Do you want me to kill you? Stop. We were only talking. What's going on? He's accusing me of being a traitor because I'm chatting. He's whispering with the Borges. I talk to the Borges, too. But that guy is a whore. Buy a bed and let them rip your ass. Stop, stop. I can be wherever I want. What's up with you? Stop attacking me. Shut up. Go back to the slum, slum dog. What do you see here? The same thing I see every day. A piece of shit. Full of people, cramped. You can't live like that. No, I know. But the Borges took over everything. The food, the cigarettes. We have no choice but to put up with it. Like today. I've been a prisoner many times. Before, for a few coins, you'd get a bed and a mattress. But these bastards want nothing. They want to keep everything. It's the one up there's fault. And I'm not talking about God. What if I told you that the one up there has had enough of the privileges? What? I'm saying that if you guys get organized and stop being a bunch of idiots, and give the message that you're a real gang that puts up with it and has the whole slum behind them, you can end up with the courtyard. But you need to be convincing. That's why I gave you the storage unit stuff to share out. You need to be clever. Do you understand? Who are you to go to the courtyard of my prison and give goods to the Sub-21 guys? With no permission. Who the fuck do you think you are? What are you listening to? Get out. I need to finish. Get out, you'll finish later. They are all rebels in here. So, Pena. Very good. I don't know if your intention was to play Robin Hood, but they ate it up. That gives me wiggle room. Good, Pena. Where's the cream for my wife's varicose vein? Here it is. She likes it more than chocolate. Borges must be nervous. (CACKLES) Be careful. If you put too much pressure on him, he can flip. No, you're going to keep him under control. In this act, I'm making you my shiny associate. And I'm giving you a positive answer for the authorization you asked me. Do you know what I'm talking about? No. We need to arrange the details, so that you don't back out. I don't know what you're talking about. You asked me to let you come out of jail for a day. I grant you the authorization. And I'll get you what you need. So you can get out and kill whoever you need to kill. EL MARGINAL IS A FICTIONAL SHOW.
