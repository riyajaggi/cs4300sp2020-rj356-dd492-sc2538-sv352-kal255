 A Netflix Original Series Thank you for coming, Your Honor. I always come to this restaurant. Their homemade cakes are sublime. Palacios, I don't have any time to waste. I don't enjoy seeing you, especially with that stupid smile. My daughter has disappeared. It seems it was a mistake to hire two lowlifes like you. You may see us as lowlifes, guys from the outskirts, right? But you, Your Honor... Using your position as a national judge

 to steal from a bunch of criminals. I don't know which is worse. Let's get to the point. In the very moment that we give you information about your daughter, you will be saving yourself several million. The arrangement we made seems a little unfair, doesn't it? How much are we talking about? Three hundred thousand dollars. It's less than 10% of what is at stake. Your daughter's life, of course. And that of my brother, whose neck is on the line. Do you know where Lunita is? That depends. Depends on what?

 On whether you're willing to pay or not. It doesn't depend on whether I'm willing to pay or not anymore. Now it depends on whether I want to let you live or not. Hands up, police! (LAUGHS) Oh. Morcilla's had it. Morci? Let's see. Is that fat fairy playing dead? (BLOWING KISSES) (CHUCKLES) No, he's really dead. Amen. May he rest in peace. What happened to you? PASTOR: A whole bucket of oil fell on me. Right. My brother says to put him in the fridge over there. And if he doesn't fit, to cut him in half. What? Scared about cutting up the fatty? (CHUCKLES) No, but I respect the dead. Ah! Back to being holier-than-thou. That defect of yours is a bummer. A real bummer! This has to remain a secret. Until my brother and the manager know what to do with Morci's body. Let's get on with it. (BLOWING KISSES) (CHUCKLES) No, only joking. Let's take him. (DIOSITO GRUNTS) Oh. Oh. At last, you dumbass. This is the one. No it isn't, it was number 17. I told you, number 17. I said number 17. You said that number 17 was the entrance to the villa, idiot. Come on. Do you think it's Morcilla? (CLICKS TONGUE) How could it be Morcilla? Luna told me that it was a fat guy and that she gave it to him. She lied to you. She sold you rotten fish. You told me yourself that Morcilla was all cut up. Yes, the guys from the Sub-21 did it. I saw him in the shower with a bad arm. There he is. There's Diosito. Stop, go back a little. There he goes. He was careful with the cameras, the bastard. No, you idiot. That's not Morcilla. (LAUGHS) And the girl told you it was the fat guy. (LAUGHING) Really funny, asshole. Bingo. Son of a bitch. There's Cesar. The guy who was with the girl is the kid from the Sub-21. We'll have to find out. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Gustavo Sosa's wife? Yes. How are you? I'm Emma. Oh. Ms. Emma. Thank you for seeing me. No, please. How can I help you? I'm a little worried. I know that you did everything properly. They told me that. The director told me that you're not involved. But... Come with me. Let's sit down over here. What happened? My mother-in-law received a call from the jail. My mother-in-law isn't well, she has heart problems. Mmm-hmm. I came on Wednesday to visit my husband, and they told me that he was in hospital. The director said that it wasn't serious. The director attended you personally? Yes. Very attentive, the director. He told me that he had gastroenteritis, but that I shouldn't say anything as it's a virus that came from in here. I left more or less reassured. But afterwards we received that call. My mother-in-law answered it and they told her that it was the jail. I thought it was Gustavo, but it wasn't. It was somebody else. It was somebody who didn't want to give their name. And they said that... That my husband is dead. That somebody shot him. Not here in the jail. He was shot in the street, that's what they told me. (VOICE BREAKING) I know it must be someone who had it in for him, and that's why they said it. But it worried me and I came here. Don't worry. Don't worry, I'll help you. I want to talk to you, Kalina. I've been looking for you. Look, I don't understand much about psychology methods and all that. But from the little that I do know, I'm sure that you're taking it too far. Don't play dumb. Be careful about getting too close to your patients, understand? No, I'm not sure that I do understand. I'm telling you that you leaked Emma's report to Diosito Borges. What you're saying offends me. It's a very serious accusation. Yes, a very serious accusation. I can report you for this. It's already become serious. And because one of your patients threatened Counselor Molinari. I cannot allow that. I let other things go. (BANGING TABLE) So be very careful. Keep that rotten bastard under control. Don't let him overstep the mark, because I'll make sure that you pay for his mistakes. Do you understand? I cannot be held responsible for one of my patient's actions. You can if you're an accomplice. FERNANDO: I'm not easily scared, Lunati. In case there's any doubt, I took the necessary precautions. So don't think I'm an idiot. You are an idiot. But if you try to extort me, then you're the king of the idiots. There are several people who know about this. Discreet people who don't go around telling everybody their secrets. Unless something unexpected happens. Do you think I care what people are saying? My daughter has disappeared. I fear for her life. As if you loved her, Lunati. If you really cared about her life we would already have made an agreement and wouldn't be here wasting time. Fine. I'll give you the money that you're asking for. That's the right decision. My brother has some details about the whereabouts of your daughter. Where is she? No. It's not that I don't trust you, but I'd like to be sure of the payment of the 300,000 first. We can make the transaction today. You go and collect the cash, and we'll go to somewhere where I have a deposit box. Don't worry, your daughter is fine. As soon as I have the money, I'll keep my side of the deal. So you know where she is? No, I didn't say that. I said we will keep our side of the deal. Hey. Get out. Get out! Hey, you fag. We've come to knock you up. We're going to ask you something, asshole. This morning in the warehouse you came across a man. He had a hood. Who was he? I don't know. Why are you asking me? (SHUSHING) What are you doing, you asshole? Why are you hitting me? Shut your mouth. You bastard. Don't play dumb. You know what we're talking about. The man came from behind, you grabbed him and hugged him. Tell me the truth, you fag. Suck my dick. I'm not a snitch. Shut your mouth. Stop, don't hit me. (SHUSHING) Talk then, you scum. If you don't I'll break your ass. CESAR: Suck my dick. (YELLING) What do you want with Cesar? What's going on? I'll give it to you, I will. (ALL ARGUING) (SHUSHING) You can keep this toothpick, I already ate, asshole. EL ENANO: Take them. What are you looking at, dumbass? Your days are numbered here. Take it. INMATE: Don't you know how to count, Colombian? Take it, dumbass. Go on. Take it, idiot. Take it! Are you okay, kid? Are you okay? Yes. Are you okay? Yes, I am. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) I've been talking to your sister. She said she has no problem with you staying at her house. Really? Mmm-hmm. But I never speak to her, or even see her. It'll be a real reunion then. Yes. What does her husband say? He never liked me. I don't know, I suppose he's decided to give you another chance. She was the one who offered. Look, Emma, I don't want to deflate your hope or be negative, but I can't see myself out there. How will I make a living? Who would give me work? All my resume says is that I've been in here all my life. Lots of people will help you. I told you we have lots of connections. And everything that you've learned about carpentry will help you a lot. I'll recommend you. You know that I love you a lot. You're very important to me. Yes, but at my age and with my past, who would ever give me a job? What is it? What are you so afraid of? Why won't you tell me? It'll do you good. You were worried about where you would go when you get out. That's resolved now. I don't know. I don't know, Emma. I won't be able to do it. No. I don't know. I don't even remember what it's like outside. I'll have to learn everything again like a little boy. I don't know how to cross the street. I don't know how to get on a bus. Not to mention how to speak to a stranger. Sometimes I imagine myself crossing the threshold with my bag and... I don't know. Maybe I'm going crazy. (SOBBING) I feel like they're throwing me in a cage. (SIGHS) What's more, my friends are in here, they're like my family. There's you. (SOBBING) And I'll be outside. You're like my family too, you know? It'll all be okay. You mustn't worry. (CRYING) (MUSIC PLAYING) Quite a blow, my friend. A stupid thing, I did it myself like an idiot. The Borges' are really amped up. A crazy guy got into the cleaning warehouse. He had a hood. I think I know who that idiot was. What do you want, dude? Nothing. I'm just letting you know. I don't care what you do, Pastor. Don't ever get involved with those assholes. Cover your ass. Thank you. Put onion on it. What? Onion makes it heal quicker. Thanks. I need to ask you a favor. A favor? You need a favor? Yes, how can I help you? I need somebody from your team to see Verruga. He's getting out in a few days. I'm very sorry, but the whole team is exhausted from the shifts, you know? I'm asking as a personal favor. It's very important to me. I have been talking to him but our chats aren't enough. Please. It would do him a lot of good, really. It's great that you talk to him, because... You're good at your job. But at the moment I cannot allow any kind of favoritism. Because afterwards, any little thing that I do, tiny, minimal, and Antin will come after me, you see. Uh-huh. Mmm. Okay. Thanks for nothing. Please. What a bummer. I'm really in need. I'm short of cash. My lawyer's asking for it. DIOSITO: Lawyers are such a pain. Yes. Know how much do they pay at the workshops? In carpentry or... They're real leeches. They take it all from you. Come here, listen. Come on, man. Get out. My brother's about to make a big move. If you want I can ask him if he needs manpower. Okay, fine. Yes. Hmm. What's it about? I'll let him tell you that. He doesn't trust anybody. Okay. What can you do well? I can adapt myself to anything. Anything except playing darts. (CHUCKLES) OFFICER: Guys, I've been looking for you everywhere. You have a visitor. (EXCLAIMS) Who's here to see him? OFFICER: The sister. Your sister? Is she hot? Come on, you idiot. We're family. This is where we note all the behavioral variables of the establishment. For example, the death rate. Ours is zero. Not one inmate died all year. We are a model establishment. I mean that we can make what we want out of the Sosa business. Great, because there's a little problem. What little problem? Uh... We need two guys. Two? What do you mean? Morcilla. Things got out of hand. What happened? He got me riled up. What did you do with the body? It's in the workshop. In the freezer. The idiot didn't fasten the hood and it fell right on his head. (SIGHS) We could say that he left with Sosa, that they escaped together and had a confrontation. The famous settling of scores. Whatever you say is fine. I'll ask my wife to give Sosa's wife a little something so she won't break our balls. Your wife, really? They're distant cousins. What a shitty family you have. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) Pastor. I had no idea where they'd sent you. No touching, please. You may only hold hands. At last I've found you. Who the hell are you? Lunati sent me. Where's my brother? I don't know, they sent me. You're hurting me, let go. Tell me the truth. Your brother arranged things with Lunati. But he doesn't want to say anything until they give him the money. Thank you. Lunati will give them what they asked for. But he doesn't want to deal with your brother anymore. He wants you and I to speak. That's not going to happen. You know where Luna is. It's obvious. We need to act fast. We can't waste any more time. Lunati said to appeal to your good faith. You made a deal between gentlemen. You know he'll come through. Please! No. The girl's life is at risk. Deal with my brother. But quickly. Because they're going to move the girl. When they move her is when we can rescue her. They must be ready. From now on, talk to me. Please. Lunati says not to cheat him. Don't try to manipulate me with that. I'm the only one thinking about the girl. When I have the details I'll pass them to my brother. (MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO) Everything okay? Mmm-hmm. Marito, here you go. MARIO: Pastor. Mario, how are you? Sit down. Make yourself comfortable. Bring him a whiskey. How do you want it? However you take it. Bring two. Fine. Thank you. My brother says you want to work. Isn't the warehouse enough? Yes. The warehouse is good, thank you. But I get a bit bored of selling to those kids. I'm looking for a bigger job. A little more action. You were right. He's like us. (DIOSITO CHUCKLES) DIOSITO: See? I told you. He has a good head on his shoulders. I want you to know that I'm very generous with the people that work with me, with those that behave well. That's why everybody wants to work with me. Because I give people the chance to grow. Stop touching me, give me a break. I give them the chance to grow. I share. Generously. So they can lead a good life. Even in here. Don't worry, Mario. I won't let you down. MARIO: Hmm. Good. Welcome to the team. Thank you. Welcome. Good. I want you to join something that I'm getting together. And if it goes well, your share will be... 80,000 pesos. Is that enough? That's very good. I said I'm a generous guy. Mmm-hmm. Good. It involves moving some merchandise, a packet that I have here in the jail. It has to be taken a few kilometers away. It's a couple of hours of travel. I'm not sure, something untoward might come up, but I doubt it. Come with me. Bring the whiskeys, Diosito. (CRICKETS CHIRPING) MIGUEL: Once inside, you never get out. A prisoner is always a prisoner. Like the cops. Once a cop, always a cop. It's written on their faces. In jail you get filled with hope. If you behave, you'll be better prepared for the outside world. A world full of shit. It's rare to get out of here alive and without some wound that has broken you. And then manage to find work. Earning enough to get by. And to fill yourself with hope or with hatred, with no way out. Jail gets so far into you that you take it with you when you get out. (SOBBING) Can you remind me to take the money to the school? The co-operative. Yes, don't worry. Okay, see you this afternoon. See you, bye. Thank you. Come, my love. Help me choose. What? Where do you want to go? Punta del Este? Cordoba? To the north, as we haven't been there? I don't know. I told you, I'm not in the mood for traveling. What's more, Punta del Este? We don't have permission for Lucas. He can't leave the country. We've asked your brother to sign the permission form so many times. We'll go north, then. North? Why do we have to run away at the drop of a hat? I have a right to know. I told you. What? A business opportunity came up. You didn't explain any of that to me. Trust me. I can't say that it'll support us for the rest of our lives, but if it goes well, we can relax for a few years. It's illegal, isn't it? Is that why you're afraid? Can you relax? Everything's fine. It's okay. A break will do us good. Mmm. (CELL PHONE RINGING) I have to get it. Yes, go ahead. I'll take this. Hello. Lunati? (SPANISH SONG PLAYING ON RADIO) Stop being sad. Buck up, honey. Not long left. Did my dad pay? No, little lady. Not yet. What are you thinking? Tell me and I'll give you a gift. What can you give me? This is a jail. They don't sell shit here. I like it when you're feisty. On the warpath. That's my girl. (TSKING) Let's talk a little. Then I'll give you something that you'll like. I'm thinking about my dad. I don't understand why he won't pay. And your mother? She died two years ago. Ooh. What a shame. If she were alive, I'd be with her at home by now. What if my dad doesn't pay what they want? Your boss said he'd send him my head wrapped up like a gift. (CHUCKLES) No. Don't worry. You're a woman. Your head is worthless. (LAUGHS) What a stupid joke. Nobody will touch you here. The only one who touches you is me. Don't worry, you'll be back with your family soon. Your daddy the judge pays, and we set you free. (MUSIC PLAYING) FEMALE OPERATOR: The telephone that you are calling is switched off or outside the service area. (BEEPING) FEMALE OPERATOR: The telephone that you are calling is... Can you turn that shit down? It's breaking my head. What's up, brother? Learn to coexist. This isn't a five star hotel. Why don't you learn to coexist, dumbass. Looks like he's having a bad day. He's taking the role of being an asshole very seriously. Enough with the music already! Doesn't it bother you? How are you doing? You've only got a few hours left. Yes. I won't lie to you, I'm shitting myself. Shitting yourself? About what could happen outside. It can't be worse than in here. The guys are throwing me a going-away party. Why don't you come? Yes, I'll be there. You're invited too, but only if your mood improves. Thank you. Did you go to that part of the old jail? No, I wouldn't dream of going there. Is somebody waiting for you outside? VERRUGA: Yes, my sister. I don't know if she really wants to, or if it's just because Emma asked her to. You're almost out. Will you be back soon or do you plan on dying first? You're old, Verruga. So much freedom at once will give you a heart attack. (CHUCKLES) What a generous country. Before, we killed people like you while you were still young. Population control. Three came in, we killed three. And we were in charge, the security guards. Then that leftie asshole arrived with that crap about the prisoner's rights, and now it's as if we're your servants. You could say we have a director with balls who maintains old school values. So prepare yourself. I'm sure we'll give you a good farewell dance. You old shitbox. I hope they shoot you down on the corner. Thank you. (SPANISH SONG PLAYING ON RADIO) Less than 10. You're very lucky. Yes, so very lucky. That's why I'm here with you instead of with my friends, right? You shuffle, you know what you're doing. I've never met a girl who plays cards so well. You shuffle them really well. Do you do everything so well? How long have you been here? Two Christmases. Why did you kidnap me? Does your boss know my dad? Are we playing cards or is it question time? You're very inquisitive. I want to know. Your dad was an associate of my boss. It was arranged. He threw a few cases and he let us work. But one day the son of a bitch fucked us over. He seized a drug shipment and a lot of money. As they say here, he earned a few beans as a judge and fucked us over. The worst thing was that he took all the money. Money that wasn't his. That can't be true. Why not? Think about it. Didn't life suddenly get better for you? (DOOR SHUTS) I didn't know that judges did home visits. Sometimes we do. Fair enough. To what do I owe the pleasure of seeing you here, Your Honor? My daughter had nothing to do with the problem that we had. Your daughter? I didn't know that you had a daughter. Don't play stupid, Borges. I've come to make an agreement. Give her back and we can do business. I don't know what you're talking about. If you want, I'll negotiate whatever you need. Lately things aren't going so well for me. What negotiation are we talking about? Where are you keeping her? Is she okay? Do you have any idea of the agony I'm going through? I feel like you're accusing me of something, but you're wrong. Take a look at where I am. What can I possibly do inside a dark and gloomy cell? Borges, I came in here clean. Look. I have no cameras. I'm not wearing a microphone. I didn't even alert the cops. Hmm. So I'm asking you to negotiate with me like men with principles. Without bringing daughters into it. You're talking to me about principles? You make even my ass laugh. Who's paying me for all the time I've been in here? I didn't expect you to do what you did for me. You did it because you're a crook, a piece of shit. At some point cycles get interrupted, they stop. Hmm? I told you that they would go after you, that they were investigating you. That we were all going down. You know what, Borges? Some dumbass has to go down eventually. I understand. Know what you can do with my money? Spend it on your family. Your daughter has health problems? She needs new braces? You'd better not touch a hair on her head. You have children too, don't you? Yes. I'd give anything for them because I'm a real father. Not like those who discard their own flesh and blood for a few peanuts. Know what? I really hope that you don't touch a hair on her head. What is it, Lunati? Are you nervous? (CHAIR RATTLES) (LAUGHING) Ciao, Lunati. You son of a bitch. That's my little biter. I'm not the only one you flirt with. That little look. I win. I caught you. You were trying to trap me. In order to win. Come here for a minute. Are you going to stay here all day, man? I was just chilling, Borges. MARIO: Don't say my name in here! You know that if things go badly you'll be the one to put a bullet between her eyes? So if you've become fond of her that's your problem, got it? And don't say my name again. There's a lot to do. Come on. You idiot. What did he say? Nothing. He didn't say anything. Promise me that you'll look after me. (DOOR OPENS) Ah. They're here. How are you? Come on, Verruga. Only good things lie ahead from now on. It's like a dream, isn't it? You're leaving. Look at how he plays the good guy so that the girls fuss over him. (LAUGHTER) Be careful when you get out, don't wait for the tram as it doesn't run anymore. If you see a television that looks strange, it's a computer. That's enough. Come on. Sit down. Let's have a drink. How about it! Hello. Counselor. How are things? How are you? Good. I didn't think I'd see you anymore. You said you were leaving soon. My stay was extended a little. Hmm. I hear your sister came to see you. Yes. How strange. In your file it states that you have no family. I don't know what my file says. I don't know what you're hiding. But watch out, because anybody could find out what I did. How's it going over here? Verruga. Look. What is it? (EMMA LAUGHS) INMATE: We all chipped in. No. Take it. So that you have something when you get out. Why not? Look what's in there. It's from the whole wing. Sofi and I bought you a gift, too. (WHOOPING) Well I never! Thank you. It's great. (CHEERING) This is high class, Verruga. Let's have a speech. No. Yes, come on. We want a speech, let him speak. Yes, let's go! We want a speech, come on! Thank you for all of this and for all of these years. Whatever I couldn't find outside, I found in here. You are my family. The family that I chose. I'm sure that these have been my best years. Anyways. I hope that you'll all be okay without me. Because I'm really going to miss you. Aw. A round of applause for Verruga. Here, let me serve you a little of this. INMATE: Have a little more. VERRUGA: No, that's fine. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) INMATE: Cheer up, Verruga. Did you have a good time in the end? VERRUGA: Yes, very good. INMATE: Your dinner is ready. (VERRUGA LAUGHS) You ate some chow, the girls spoiled you, some kisses... Clothes, money. How about it? You must come and visit us. We need to keep the drawing classes up. You've no idea how well you draw. Really? You didn't invite me to the party. I hope you behave yourself this time. And don't end up back in here. If they let you. I've heard that people go around lynching ex-cons in the street. Did you know that? Leave him alone, come on. He did nothing to you. What have you there? Great. It's my size. Thank you. Hey. Hey, hey. Give him back the shirt. What's your problem? Give it back to him. (YELLS) What are you thinking? Are you Robin Hood, asshole? Know what you are? You're a bitter piece of shit. You couldn't be a real cop so you pull your crazy shit in here. But I'd love to see you on the street, facing crime head-on. You want to go one on one? Me? I'll meet you in the ring in an hour. One on one, you and me. I'm going to bring you down. What's the ring? The ring? It's a one on one in the visitor's room. Capece fights dirty. Please, be careful. Nobody's seen him lose. We'll see about that. Do you remember where I put the medicine? Is it in the suitcase? Lucas' medicine. You left it upstairs. Where? In the bag. I'm losing my mind... Can you come for a second? Okay. Thank you. (CELL PHONE RINGING) Hello. You idiot. Why did you have to go ahead and ask for more money? They went gossiping to you. Stop being paranoid. Being scared shitless doesn't suit you. In life you have to take risks sometimes. You'll thank me. MIGUEL: I have something important to tell you. You need to come tomorrow. FERNANDO: I can't. Tomorrow I get paid and I disappear. Betina and I are going away with your son. Don't worry. It's just a precaution. What do you mean, going away? For how long? I don't know. Until all of this blows over. Until they get the girl back and it's safe to come back. As soon as I get what I asked for, I'll give them the information. There was a change of plans. I need you to come. Tell me now. I don't have time to come. They're going to move her, understand? Yes, I understand. Do you know where to? MIGUEL: Not yet. But it'll happen this afternoon during Argentina's soccer match. I'm traveling with her. I'll have the details of the place tomorrow. Okay. I'll be waiting for your call. Is Lucas okay? He's happy about the trip. Ciao. See you later. Where was I? Yes, that's right, your son... Focus, buddy, the neighbor just left. His first time on a plane. MIGUEL: Listen, Fernando. If you're going, please go and see Mom. Make sure that she's okay. Fine. I'll go. Don't worry. Take money. To pay in advance. In case you take a while to come back and they take her out. Okay. I will. We'll talk tomorrow. Look after yourself. Be on the lookout, okay? Understand? (INMATES CLAMORING AND CHEERING) (WHISTLING) INMATES: Hooray! Pastor! (WHISTLING AND CHEERING CONTINUES) Ready to go? (GRUNTS) (CAPECE LAUGHING) (CHEERING CONTINUES) INMATE 1: Come on! INMATE 2: Give it to him! (GRUNTING) (GRUNTS LOUDLY) (GROANS) (GRUNTING) (GROANING) Stop, you asshole. Stop! Enough! (ANTIN LAUGHING AND CLAPPING) Enough! (INMATES CHEERING) (SPITS) Watch out! (GRUNTING) (WHISTLING) Let's go! (CHEERING) (CHEERING CONTINUES) MIGUEL: There always comes a time when you feel completely alone. Alone with your body and your soul. Detached from everything. And unable to think. Your head becomes a jail cell and it overwhelms you. They are all tests that you must pass in this hell hole so that, with the mercy of God, those lacking spirit, the weak, those that resist, at least have Our Lord's forgiveness. May God forgive your sins and lead you to everlasting life. Sweet Jesus, be not his judge, but his savior. Amen. EL MARGINAL IS A FICTIONAL SHOW.
