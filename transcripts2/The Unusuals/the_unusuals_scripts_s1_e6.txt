 2nd squad, this is dispatch. A reminder... today is crime awareness day. Tomorrow is crime avoidance day. Thursday is sloppy joe day. Oh, hold on, Eddie. Let me guess. He hit you with a giant shoe? Yeah, very funny. I caught this clown on grand street jabbing people with a hypodermic needle. Animals! With their filthy sex diseases! All right, keep moving!

 Clowns were a lot different when I was a kid. I'll say. Walsh. Lou. Hey. This is my partner, Casey Shraeger. Lou Powell. Hi. What's up? Can I talk to you for a minute? I'm gonna... be upstairs. Yeah. Yeah, come on. You got to help me. Well, what do you need? I can't go to the detectives in my squad. I got too many write-ups already. You're the only friend I got left.

 Well, I mean, look, I'll help in any way I can. What can I do? I think I... maybe... killed someone. What might you mean you think you killed someone? I got drunk last night. Oh, Lou. Five years sober, and I screwed up. I guess I blacked out. I woke up two hours ago in an alley. Like this. My off-duty weapon is missing. What happened to your hands? I don't know. Were you with anyone? Lou, come on. I don't think so. I know... I've been slamming my head against the wall trying to figure it out! Lou, you're killing me. Okay. Take off your shirt. Come on. Just take off your shirt. I know this lab tech. He can test the blood, see if it's human, see if it's yours. Just hang tight, okay? Thank you. Don't thank me. If you did this, I can't protect you. So... and I know I've asked you this before... but the big bowl of four frog soup, is that four whole frogs? You got to be kidding me. Okay. All right. Uh, let me just go with, uh, squab neck, leave it at that. Ni hao ma. Hey. Mustache. Mustache. It's looking good. Very, uh, tom selleck. What are you, high? This is pure pre-beard serpico, man. What are you modeling? What is that, the super mario? Okay, nice try. This is your classic chevron. Made popular by one Albert Einstein. Oh, okay. Xie xie. Keep it real, man. Thank you. I think it makes you look old. The... the mustache. Do you remember the one you had in high school? All six hairs. Used to tickle my lip. Karen? Don't look so surprised. I know you've been thinking about me. Did you just call me karen? No. Okay, listen. I don't know how to tell you this. I just got off the phone with the medical examiner. They got a body in late last night. A gunshot wound. Son... your partner, Leo Banks, is dead. Take off the vest. I told you, I feel safer with it on. Corrected by Chamallow35 - Addic7ed.com Hey. Put this on. It's okay. She knows the deal. She's here to help. Can I, uh, see your knuckles? Any other indication you've been fighting? No. Can you empty your pockets? You and the other scientists been drinking all night? I'm racking my brains here. All right. Let's just start with... what you remember. I don't know. I'm so hung over. Everything's blurry. Um... buying a fifth at PJ's liquor store, I guess. Okay. Well, then that's where we're going. Get your stuff. Walsh. Shraeger. All right. I'll meet you out in the car, okay? Petty larceny just came in. Can you guys take it? Oh, we would, but we just got a 13-13. How bad? I don't know. Could be bad, though. Well, the six-hour rule applies. Got it. Walsh, what the hell is a 13-13? 13-13 is the unofficial code for "officer in trouble." The investigating officer gets six hours to make the problem go away. And what if they can't? Then things get real ugly real fast. Detective Delahoy? I'm sorry about your partner. Is that him? How did he die? He was shot during a liquor-store robbery. You ready? It's not... it's not him. Are you sure? Yeah, no, I am pretty sure. He had I.D. on him. His social security number matched. Uh... okay. "Leo Banks." Chinese guy. He's gonna love this. Who? Uh, Banks. Okay, look, this is gonna get old real fast. Well, what do you think? Hmm? I could have been a doctor, right? I mean, I was smart enough. But you know what happened, right? How Tommy Balboa knocked me up in community college. I know your mom's been filling you in. She sees my dad sometimes at the grocery barn. Another headache, huh? Yeah. That thing's gonna kill you. No. Detective? Are you okay? Not really. Listen, uh, let me ask you something. A guy has a brain tumor... does he tend to see things, you know, hallucinate or whatever? Are you seeing things? No, no, no. It's for a case, a perp. Well, it depends on where the tumor is, but brain tumors have been known to cause auditory and visual hallucinations. Great. Okay, uh, look, get... get this guy fingerprinted, and get a real I.D. on him, okay? I will, but... but what? I already notified the social security office That leo banks is dead. Naturally. Okay. What the hell is going on? Hightower just hugged me and cried on the stairs. Please. Look at you. Come here. That's nice, huh? Maybe you should sit down first. No, no. I don't want to sit down. Just tell me. Yeah? Yeah. Okay. You're dead. That's not funny. No, I'm... I'm not kidding. You're legally dead. I just came from the morgue. What?! Some asian guy stole your identity. I mean, he's got a driver's license, credit cards in your name, the whole thing. Last night, he gets popped holding up a liquor store. M.E. does the paperwork, calls social security, And just like that, Leo Banks is, uh... is dead. Well, I don't want to be dead! Just in case you haven't been paying attention. I know. It's kind of ironic, no? Yeah, a little. Don't worry about it, man. We're getting prints off your corpse. Huh? No, off the corpse, the corpse's corpse. And, you know, we'll have the real identity in a couple of hours. Anybody want to donate to the Leo Banks burial fund? That's funny. He's good, right? He's very funny. I walk by here every day on my way home. It's like a test. Prove I've changed. Most days, I don't even look. I got my five-year chip on Monday. Yesterday, I came here, I got a fifth of tequila. Why? I don't know. My fight with marcy maybe. Maybe because another perp I busted got off on the charges. Or maybe I just wanted a drink. There's no cameras. Excuse me. Uh, this guy, was he in here yesterday? Yeah. Around 5:00. Stared at the wall for about 30 minutes and then bought something brown. You remember anything else? Like what? His bra size? Never mind. Actually, wait. He got real excited about the brochures. What brochures? You know, for tourists. Asked me if he could take one. Said, "what do I care? That's what they're here for." Thanks. Well? You remember anything? "The circle line." I think I got on the circle line. All right. I hate boats. Let's go. Walsh, I hate... boats. That your wife? She's pretty. She give you herpes yet? She will. No. Sure. Sure, no, no. I appreciate that. But listen, listen. If I'm dead, How am I talking to you right now?! Prints came back. Identity thief was some idiot named Jimmy "Kung" Fu. Uh, priors, you know, assaults, robbery, the whole thing. Yeah, well, I pulled my credit report and all the statements. Seems like Jimmy Kung Fu's been ripping me off for months. He even took one of those disney cruises where everybody dresses up like pinocchio. Yeah. You know, I always wanted to go on one of those. Yeah. Me, too. Well, now you have. The key is, next time to get one of these guys to do your jury duty for you. Let me see that thing. There you go. Maybe we can figure out where this guy got your credit card info, huh? Say, laser tag, nacho mama, drakkar noir store, armory locksmith... uh, no. That... that's me. Sharper image, cutler locksmith. Yeah. That's me, too. I change my locks every week. So, anytime I see a locksmith... Pr... pretty much. Okay. All right. Hey, what about this? January 12th. The coffee shop on Delancey. Remember that place where you can't order a cup of coffee that doesn't taste like hazelnut? Yeah. So? Yeah, so, after that, your credit info splits. I'll bet you that's where kung fu got your credit card. You know, this is a nightmare. You know what happens when they declare you dead? Social security contacts your employer. They freeze your pension. Paychecks stop. All my bank accounts... frozen. It's gonna take me months to clear this up. Thank you, Jimmy. Wait. How do I know this is gonna stop just 'cause Jimmy's dead? What if he's got more credit cards at his place? It's worth a look. You know, I could use some more drakkar noir. Ugh, I hate boats. All right, thanks, Doug. So, the lab results are back. The blood on your shirt was definitely human, but it wasn't yours. Looks like we have five hours before we have to go public with this, Lou. You remember anything else that might help? On our first date, Marcy and I took the circle line. September 5, 1996. I meant something that might help with the case. Oh. No. Okay, well, we're pulling your credit-Card info and phone log. So, if you charged anything last night or made a phone call, we're gonna know soon. Walsh. Yeah? Can I, uh, talk to you for a second? Yeah. Listen, I... I think he's playing you here, Walsh. Lou? No. If he says he doesn't remember, he doesn't remember. Let me just put this in your ear, okay? He could be building a defense here. An argument for mental incompetence which he could take to trial. And he's using us to do it. You see? Wait, I remember now. I tried to get on the boat last night, but I missed it. Are you kidding?! No, I... I drank the fifth and stumbled over, but they already closed the gate. Oh! Excuse me! Excuse me. Excuse me. NYPD. Ohh... crap. Detective. Oh. Hey, leach. Hey, uh... who was the guy that was in here with Walsh and Shraeger before? You mean train wreck? He works out of the 1-5. Lou Powell. Guy's a legend. A legend how? Well, when I knew him, the guy carried contact solution everywhere. Except he didn't wear contact lenses. The bottle was full of gin. He almost got fired for it a few times. Thank you. Jimmy Kung Fu? Went out last night. Ain't seen him since. You his wife? Yeah, right. We got bad news for you, ma'am. Jimmy's dead. Bad news to somebody. I'm pretty happy about it. Nice. Nice girl. The name "Leo Banks" mean anything to you? The dummy. What? What? That's what Jimmy called it... his alter ego... "The dummy." He used to laugh about it Every time he bought something. Did he? Now I'm definitely taking that tv. Hey, don't forget the speakers, man. Those are nice. Yeah, yeah. It's coming. If you had to describe Jimmy... Two words... danger freak. Oh, like you always driving fast, picking fights. I kept telling him, "a handgun is not a sex toy." Similarities are uncanny. But Jimmy liked things how he liked them. Any idea where he bought the fake I.Ds? Let me keep the cds and the game console, and I'll tell you. Oh, I like that 50 cents. Yeah. Yours. All right. Guy named lowdown pat. Over in alphabet city. Sorry again about the boat. Lou. Lou, you're gonna have to help me out here. I mean, we just lost three hours. I'm gonna have to bring my sergeant in on this soon. Here, take these. "Train wreck" Powell, right? Hey. Come on. You were clean for five years. Okay, so whatever happened last night, that was a mistake. And we're... we're gonna figure it out. Okay? Sit tight. Come on. Look, anybody asks what you're doing here, just tell them you're here to see me about a case. Thanks, Jason. So, I come home early, and there she is, in bed with her pilates instructor. That's the day I became a clown for real. A joker. A joke. Hey, what are you working on? It's classified. Top secret clearance. Omega-mega 16. There's no such clearance. That's what you think. I found some bloody paper towels in the utility room. Walsh. So? Maybe someone got a bloody nose. You know, it's my job to protect this precinct, Walsh, and if you're into something here, I need to know about it. Wrong, Eddie. You're a detective, just like me. So why don't you go process the clown with the filthy mouth. Solve your cases. Stay out of mine. So you're saying, there is a case. I'm saying, "mind your own business." Why is it whenever there's something funky going on around here, you're always right in the middle of it? Leave it alone! I'm not afraid of you. You know, you don't get it. You think that... that we're all freaks. That somehow that you don't fit in. Well, guess what, you're the biggest freak that we got. I'm watching you! So, I had a uniform move Lou down to the record room to keep him away from Alvarez. We're running out of time. I... Walsh, I got to say, I think Alvarez could be right this time. What? No, I know the guy is your friend, listen, but he shows up, right? He's covered in blood, his knuckles are scraped, his gun is missing, and he says, "I think I might have killed someone." Yeah, I definitely think he killed someone. No. No. No? Why not? I don't know if you know any drunks, okay? But it's not like drinking turns them into some... some other person, okay? Booze just makes who they are more intense. I once watched Lou... he talked a girl off a ledge. It took six hours, okay? She still sends Christmas cards. There's no way he killed anyone. Well, we got Powell's data back. After the liquor store, he did not use his credit card, and he didn't use his phone. Great. Yeah, I know. But listen, I was thinking... maybe we can reconstruct Powell's night In a different way. Okay, how? Well, clearly he went out, got drunk, started looking for trouble. With any luck, that trouble will involve a cop. Dispatch, this is 512. 512, go ahead. Go to two. 512, go ahead. Hi, I'm, uh, looking for any 911 calls received last night that might connect to an off-duty officer. We got a mugging on fourth street. 11:55 p.m. an off-duty officer was involved. Great. Will you have the, uh, dispatching officers Meet us at the scene? Thanks. Nice. I know. I'm telling you right now, I don't know anything about stealing I.Ds. Shut up. Hey, you think I'm safe now? Safe how? You know, Jimmy Kung Fu took my name... my identity, and he died at 42, right? So, I'm thinking, maybe... that, uh, that he died for me. And the real banks is safe. Or maybe Jimmy Kung Fu would have lived to have been 100, except then he takes your name and eats a bullet at age 42. Thank you. That's, uh, very helpful. Aren't you glad he's here? You can't ignore me forever. Enjoy your stay. I... what? I got to disappear. You cover for me. What?! So, Lou Powell, out of the 1-5? That's the guy. We got the call around 11:55 last night. When we rolled up, officer Powell had a perp in a headlock. Guy mugged some yuppies with a saw. Powell grabbed him, and they struggled, wound up on the ground. Truth is, your boy was looking a little cloudy. And did you notice if he hurt himself at all? His knuckles got scraped up pretty bad. We offered him a ride to the E.R., but he said no. Guess the blonde was more interesting. The blonde? Oh, yeah. 5'4", long hair. What a rack. Why do guys always say that? It's not like you can hang a coat on them. You're right. Let me clarify. Her breasts were incredible. So you're saying that Powell was with a woman. She wasn't a bystander. Not a bystander. Did you notice anything else about her? Yeah, like her face? No. But she really went for the hero bit. So there's no way officer cloudy didn't get lucky last night. All right. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it. Say hi to your mom for me. At least we know how he banged up his hands. And that there is a blonde with a tremendous front porch somewhere. Who wasn't with him earlier. So, clearly, Powell kept drinking. Maybe he met this... met this girl at a bar? Or a place where they put little umbrellas in their drinks? All right. Hey. Mustache! What do you call that? It's kind of an "after eight" with a billy dee thrown in. "Sundance kid." Redford. Classic. Can I get you anything? Walsh asked me to check in, make sure you're okay. No. I'm... I'm good. Thanks. How about a soda? Come on, guy. I promised Walsh I'd take care of you. We mustaches got to stick together. Yeah. A soda would be great. Thanks. Hey, I'm lou Powell. Eddie Alvarez. Yeah. All right. Yeah, one soda coming up. You know, let me throw that out for you. Yeah. Thanks, man. Yeah. Okay. Got it. We've got a problem. Officer lewis Powell. From the 1-5. He's downstairs... hiding. I think he was involved in a violent incident in the last 12 hours. Walsh is trying to protect him. Just leave it alone. It's a 13-13. Walsh has still got 90 minutes. Uh, okay, I pulled Powell's service record, and he has a history of black marks and reprimands, mostly surrounding his drinking. He also has a couple of, uh, excessive-Force charges from five years ago. I think this guy is dirty, and Walsh is... is trying to bury it. He is a cop, and he's in trouble. Have you not learned one thing from your team-building exercise? Oh, okay, so you're saying that you would risk the security of the precinct for some random cop? Because I won't. So, either you call Walsh and tell him his time's up, or I will. Get out. Okay. So I'll call him? Get out. All right. So, how come they call you "lowdown pat"? Honestly? It's just like a play on words. You know, how like they call a fat guy "tiny"? But the truth is, I'm... I'm grandmother nice. Just so you know, I'm legally dead, so if I come over there and knock you upside your head, there's not a lot anybody can do about that. I'll keep that in mind. You sold my credit-card information to Jimmy Kung Fu. Allegedly. Got it from a coffee shop on Delancey Street. Probably bought it from a waiter, along with a lot of other people's. I'm an entrepreneur. This country was built on the idea of a free-market economy. Look what we found at your apartment. You are organized. I'll... I'll give you that. Is there any way that we could maybe make a deal here? Alphabetical. Cross-referenced. What do you want? You want my buyers or my sellers? Oh, this is good. What? Oh, man. You really sell that one? Maybe. Do we have a deal? We got a deal, if you don't answer my questions, I'm gonna hit you with a bag of oranges. Then, yes, I sold it last year to a guy lives out in Jersey. Cost real money, too. That Mark had such good credit. Stolen identity number 239... Eric Delahoy. Hi. Is this a bad time? No. Not at all. How's your friend? Well, he's alive. Which he doesn't happen to think is as funny as everybody else, but... Well, I feel so stupid. I should have confirmed with fingerprints. Yeah. Well, that's why I'm here, actually. I, uh... I need a favor. Okay. You know that perp I told you about, the one with the brain tumor? Yeah, well, there's... there's no perp. It's me. Right. I knew that. Right, well, look, I was wondering if maybe, um... if maybe you wouldn't mind e... examining me. You would have to be substantially less alive. I'm a medical examiner. Okay, I'm not talking about cutting me open. Okay, I'm talking about giving me blood tests or x-Rays or whatever. If I sent your blood work to the lab, do you know what they would say to me? "Hey, Monica, this guy's alive." Look. I was fine. You know? And then I hit my head. I was chasing some guy, and I hit my head, and I end up in the E.R., and I get an x-Ray. And the next thing I know, I got some doctor telling me I got a brain tumor. So you go to a specialist. I don't like doctors, okay? And I don't want to end up in some hospital somewhere. But I'm getting pretty bad headaches. And I'm starting to see my, um, high-school girlfriend everywhere I go, you know? Only she's 17 and I'm 37, and it's really starting to creep me out. Plus... I know you'll keep it quiet. I will? Yeah. Because if you don't, I'll tell your boss how you pronounced my partner dead without bothering to check whether or not he's chinese. Which he isn't, by the way. Okay. Thanks. How are you? You work last night? He come in? Got me. But to be fair, if it ain't got flapjacks, I don't look too close. Flapjacks? You know, mambos, rangoons, sweater puffs, sweet rolls. Come on. Hefties? Angel cakes? Lactoids? What? Thank you. Come on. Hefties? "Hefties." I didn't say it. I swear, if you took all the time that men wasted thinking about the female breast throughout history, there'd only be enough time to read a magazine. What, like juggs or maxim? Yeah, you're adorable. Oh, let me see the postcard thingy that was on Powell. Oh. Yeah, that. This thing? What is that? Like a crossword puzzle or something? Are you kidding me? You've never seen this? It's the periodic table of elements. Like iron, hydrogen, oxygen. Did you go to high school? Yeah, but while you were in class, I was hitting things with a bat. Except it doesn't look like a postcard. It's like a... note card or something. Which Powell got where? Bars aren't really known for their stationery. Right. All right. If you went to a bar, got drunk, picked up some chick, what's next? Take her home. Except we went to Powell's place, and it was clean. Maybe they went to her place. Or... a hotel. Take your time. All right. Looks like there is a boutique hotel on Rivington that just opened called "the elementary." It's a stretch, but... I'll take it. Where you been? I told you. I had a thing. I'm a very happy man. Ask me why. No. I'll tell you why, Eric. Eric Delahoy... of 111 Harmony Lane, Princeton, New Jersey. What are you talking about? That's not me. Oh, yes, it is, my friend. It is. Unless you don't remember splitting the check with me that day at the coffee shop. Let me see that. Lowdown pat said the guy who bought your identity is named Bob Ryder. Petty criminal. Six arrests, three years. Did a little time upstate. So there's another me out there, huh? You're not upset about that? I don't know. I'll tell you what's not fair about this whole thing... Your guy actually improved your credit score. Bought a house in Princeton, got married, had a kid. Meanwhile, my guy? Got a new tv every week. It's not a competition, Leo. Lowdown pat really did his homework. He's got your whole life here. Did you really grow up near lake placid? Yeah, for a few years. My dad moved us there when we were, like, 10. You know, sick of the city. We were gonna live off the land and, uh... and build a house. So we packed up the station wagon and... we moved to a field and lived in a tent. Yeah, I'm having a hard time picturing you in a tent. I don't think the old man realized how difficult it was to build a house. It took us two years. You're kidding. I was not, uh... I was not popular with the local kids. Except for Karen. Karen. Karen Delmonte. She was, you know... you know, she was my first love or whatever. So, Princeton, New Jersey, huh? Yep. Bob Ryder. Want me to come with? Pick him up? No. I'll go. You sure? Yeah. I will see you soon, my man. Clerk said Mr. Powell checked in last night around 1:00 with a young woman. The room is actually paid up through tomorrow. Oh, my God! Ellen Richards, 23 years old. Lives on avenue "c". Lived. Look at the shape of these bruises. Looks like she was beaten to death with the grip of a revolver. Powell's gun. Not necessarily. Oh, come on, Walsh. Look, you did your best. He killed her and dumped the gun. Yeah. I don't know. This isn't him. That could have been us. We used to talk about it. Remember? Getting married. We were teenagers. You were the first girl I ever even kissed. It's not too late, Eric. You can still find a girl, start a family. I have a brain tumor. You went to the doctor. That means you want to live. There's still time. Come here. Look closer. There. Can I help you? Yeah. My name is Eric Delahoy. Oh, it gets worse. Oh, God. Please don't arrest me. Why shouldn't I? Listen. You don't... understand. Everything's changed. Okay? When I... became you, I turned my life around. I was... I was a screw-up... before. But then I became Eric Delahoy, and, uh, everything changed. I... I got married. I had a baby. I have a good job now. I... I pay my bills. I... I give money to charity. Please. You c... you can't tell my wife. Eric? Is everything okay? Eric. Everything's fine, uh... Mrs. Delahoy. I'm, uh, Detective Leo Banks. There's been a string of robberies, you know, in the neighborhood. And, uh, I just came by here to ask you folks if, uh... you know, you'd seen any suspicious cars or... No. No. Should I be worried? No, no, no. It's probably just some kids. I'm sure we'll catch them. You can go on in, hon. I'll take care of this. Okay. All right. I, uh... I don't know how to thank you, Detective, uh... Delahoy. Just do me a favor, all right? Stay out of trouble. And you take care of your family. You'll have the name to yourself soon enough. That was nice. Yeah. You know... it really is good to see you, I mean, even if you are a hallucination or whatever. You know, I think that maybe you were the only girl I ever really loved. You're sweet. Do you think I could call you or... you know, like the grown-up you? I'm married, remember? Sure. But listen to me. Don't give up. You're not dead yet. What a mess. Sarge. So... Alvarez is taking officer Powell into custody. 13-13's over. I'm taking you off the case. It's not my call. It's okay. You did what you could. I got to put you and Shraeger on desk duty. Get back to the shop, write it up. Please. Okay. Hey, Walsh, we matched the blood on Powell's shirt to the victim. All right. Thanks. Tell Alvarez. It's his case now. Yeah, yeah. Something else, though. Both the girl's blood and the small amount of vomit on Powell's shirt show traces of rohypnol. Roofies? That's right. Both Powell and the victim were roofied last night. Okay, so what if somebody drugs both of them, follows them here, and then kills her? Who? Why? Only one person has unsupervised access to drinks at a bar. That bartender. Go. I owe you. Is this 'cause I wouldn't shut up about your boobs? Nope. It's because of her. Ouch. You know who that is, right? A dead girl? Her name's Ellen Richards. I'm drawing a blank. It's your ex-girlfriend. Yeah, I don't have girlfriends. I'm a hit-it-and-keep-moving kind of guy, you know? Right, so you're saying that you and Ellen kept it casual. I'm saying most of the girls I bang I wouldn't recognize with the lights on. We found this picture on the wall in the men's room in the bar. It's a nice, uh, collection of half-naked women. But you and Ellen, you were in most of the pictures together. How long were you dating, was it? Was it six months? Listen, while you were sitting in here, I called Ellen's roommate. She told me that Ellen dumped your ass a week ago after you cheated on her. That's funny. You're a comedian. I don't get dumped. Oh, so sensitive. I bet she really busted your balls, huh? Or should I call them yarbles? Bollocks? Ghoulies? Shut up. Mangerines. Wedding vegetables. You're lucky your boyfriend's here. I could ask him to leave. Hey, Earl, look at me. Over here. There you go. Last night, your Ellen met another man and decided to rub it in your face. So she brought him to your bar. You dosed their drinks, you followed them back to the hotel, and you killed her. I'm not saying another word without a lawyer. Okay. Fine. Well, you wait here for your lawyer while my partner and I take our search warrant to your apartment. See you soon. How did it go with Ryder? Dead end. The guy skipped town. Good luck trying to fix your credit. It's a nightmare. Let it go. Let it go, man. Rest in peace, Leo Banks. I say... I say pick a name out of this box, move somewhere with trees, live a new life. You all right? Ted Michaels. No, no, you're right. Two first names. That's ridiculous. Uh, Ron Hasselmeier. I'm Ron Hasselmeier! I live in the forest! All right, Gabe Tsoukis. You might as well be called Bob Svoulaki. You been drinking? All right, there it is. Very well. Peter Sharpe. Peter Sharpe. Peter Sharpe, my friend. He ain't afraid to go to movies. He ain't afraid to order fish at a restaurant on a Sunday. Peter Sharpe looks you in the eye when he talks to you. Peter Sharpe races sports cars, man, with the top down, naked, while he's on a "date." You know what I'm talking about? Peter Sharpe. Let me see that. "Peter Sharpe." Peter Sharpe. Really? In case I can't get my own life working... All right. You never know. Sounds good, Pete. Sharpe! Sharpe. Peter! That's right. What ever happened to "mustaches have to stick together"? You don't deserve to wear the mustache. Let him go! He didn't kill anyone. Nice try. The bartender did it. Earl Bentley. Found these bloody clothes in the garbage at his place. The victim was his ex-girlfriend. Ellen was making out with Powell right in front of Earl at the bar. So Earl roofied their drinks, followed them back to the hotel, and killed Ellen when Powell was passed out. Let him go. Alvarez, in my office... now. I'll take those. Thanks. I don't know what to say. Well, you're an alcoholic, Lou. You need to get to a meeting, find yourself a new sponsor. But until then, if you feel like drinking, Call me. Jason... That's okay. Cone on, I'll walk you out. I got to say, you are loyal. I'm just a big dumb dog. Narc. Narc. Narc. Loser. Way to go, man. Nice. Okay, I'll be back. Yeah. Hey. Good work today, Eddie. Yeah, right. No, hey, I'm serious. Finding that blood, putting the pieces together. You know, you're a good cop. For a freak. Hey, we're all freaks, aren't we? That's a good thing... to stand out, to be different. It makes us good at what we do. You just have to understand that there are more important things than rules. Without rules, everything falls apart, Walsh. All right. How about this? A new rule. Cops first. And I'm not just talking about the guy sitting next to you. I'm talking about... all of us. Because guys that do what we do, we deserve a little... room. A little slack. "Slack." I'm not talking about corruption. I'm saying, if a guy gets into trouble you do what it takes to help him out. Because you know that he'll do the same for you. It's called a family. Yeah. I've heard of that. Well, you should try it next time. I think you'll find that people stop filling your locker with peanuts. Hey, uh, can I get a beer for my friend here? Okay. Okay. Well, let's get started. First I'm gonna draw your blood. So, do you want to sit up on the table? Ow! Sorry. It's been a while since I did this on someone alive. Listen, um... don't move. Stop being such a girl.
