Well, have you ever gone to confession? When I was 6. Well, confession is salvation. It's to be naked in front of god And know that no matter what you've done, he loves you. Smelling horses everywhere. Whores? Not whores, horses. I don't want to think about what my life would be like If I smelled whores everywhere. Uh-Huh. Are you listening to me? Do you know how hard it is to get clown makeup off a bone saw? Listen. I, uh... I'm ready to get the m.R.I. Detective, what part of "I can't help you" Don't you understand? The new york city medical examiner's office Does not have an m.R.I. Machine. You know why? Because if we need to look inside somebody's head, We use this. Okay. Okay.

You know, my dad retired last year, And he's... He's driving her crazy. Where did you go for dinner? A place in soho. Oh, yeah? Which one? Are you interrogating me? No, I, uh... I prefer to think of this as an interview. Interrogation implies... torture. You didn't just invite me to lunch because you miss me. And you didn't go to dinner with your mom last night. No. I was on a date. Awesome. What's her name? Casey, look. We never said we were exclusive. Oh, that's fine. I just spent all day crouched over a bloated, naked corpse. I want to see how the other half lives. I've been working a lot. So was I. We make time for what matters. Wait a minute. What, are you... Are you actually blaming this on me? Is that what you're trying to do? You're trying to say it's my fault that you went out And went on a date with some blond slut? How did you know she was... Cop. Her name is lisa. She's a lawyer. That's wonderful. She's nice to me. She doesn't bit my head off every time I suggest we go to a nice restaurant. I don't bite your head off. No, but I can tell the minute we get ere That you can't wait to leave. That's because they're all, you know, pretentious people. Like me. I like you, casey. I really do. But you've made it very clear that I embarrass you. That is not true. I'm a smart guy. I work hard. I'm well-Paid. I give a lot of money to charity. So if I want to live in a nice apartment And eat at a fancy restaurant, that's my choice. I had no idea you were so unhappy with me. Will you stop it? I've been crazy about you since you were 18. Now, how do you think it makes me feel That I know that you like me best when I'm not being myself? You know what? I'm not hungry. Uh, what are we doing in the interview room? I thought we were gonna prank walsh. Have a seat. Okay. Let me ask you. Do you know why walsh is great at playing practical jokes? He's a great cop. I'm a great cop. You're an efficient cop. You know what's keeping you from being great? You're a terrible liar. Thank you. No, eddie. You don't get it. All great cops are great liars. They have to be. Half the job is getting people to tell them things That they don't want to tell you. How do we convince them to do that? We lie. We trick. We prank. That... That's coercion. Okay. Eddie... You know the trick to, uh... lying? Selling the lie. It's the same with a prank. There comes a moment in every great prank When you got to sell it. A moment's hesitation, an eye flicker, And, you know, if you're gonna prank walsh, You, my friend, are gonna have to sell it. Think you can do that? Oh, yeah. Watch and learn. - Mm Detective. Amanda maint's boyfriend, eah? Yeah... Woody. Listen, can I talk to you? You should know I'm not in a very friendly mood right now Vis-?-Vis men. Okay. Mostly because they're liars, And they make you feel bad about yourself When all you're trying to do is Be the best person that you can be. Is this a bad time? 'Cause I could come back. No, have a seat. So, what's going on? Uh, well, last week, I was by the house to see amanda, And her dad was outside being hassled by this guy. Looked kind of serious. Describe him. Uh, he was maybe 6'2", Mean. I mean he looked mean. And they were arguing. But I-I couldn't hear. 6'2", look... Looked mean. That's not... That's not really a lot to go on. Well, he had this weird license plate on his car... "No you." "No you." Except with an "I" instead of a "y." N-O-I-O-U? He must be pretty mad they spelled "you" wrong. Uh, do you know what an I.O.U. Is? No. "I owe you." Not getting it. All right, never mind. I'll check this out. Thanks. Yeah. "No I.O.U." I'm guessing you're in the loan business? I've been known to help a man in need. Like byron maint? Byron maint. Oh, it's this guy. You had an argument with him in front of his house last week? Right. Yeah? This is him this morning. Hey, whoa, no. I don't know nothing about that. He owe you money? Miss a payment or two? No, no. We had words 'cause I wouldn't lend him money. Why not? We're in a credit crunch. In the old days, I'd throw cash to anyone who asked. But now, I mean, you just can't trust people these days. The truth is, I'm going back to school to get a nursing degree. There's no money in money anymore. So where were you at 8:00 a.M. This morning? In class with 30 other students. Any idea why byron would need to borrow money from you In the first place? I don't know. But he was desperate. And whatever fat man was into, he needed money fast. I know it's too late, But I want to say I'm sorry I'm sorry I believed you When you said that woman was your cousin. Sarah, I know it's too late, But I wanted to say I'm sorry. I'm sorry I ever loved you. So many years, so many mistakes. How many lies do you have to tell Before everything you are is just a lie? This boy is officially done laying low. I'm back, baby. No. No, yes. And it's gonna be epic. We are gonna own this town, brother. I don't do that anymore, frank. God has shown a better path for me Yeah, but you didn't call god, did you, navan? You called me. I'm sorry I said that I didn't mind... This isn't a game, frank. You killed kowalski, And you put my partner in the hospital! You're acting like I'm the problem here, navan. Every time I help you out, do you say, "thank you, frank"? Can anybody save me, or do I have to save myself? Hey. I pulled the apology line phone records for that missing week. The callers are coming in this afternoon. These tapes are incredible. People call this number and apologize For all of the terrible things That they have done in their lives. It doesn't work that way, henry. You don't just get to say you're sorry and move on. That's why we have prisons. What's up? So, uh, traffic control found byron's car. Had the uniforms search it... They found this. Baby laxatives, huh? Do the maints have a baby? No. Byron have a baby with another woman? Maybe that's why he needed money so badly. Maybe. Why don't you circle back to the family and see what they say? Okay. Amanda, I truly am sorry for your loss. I don't want you to think that my partner and I Were being insensitive or judging your father For the way he chooses... No, I have a weird family. Why do you think I fought so hard to get out, go to school? Oh, I get it. Trust me. Your parents were nudists? No. No, no, no, no. They were not. But... Um, well, I know what it's like To be an outsider in the family, you know? Yeah. Listen, we found baby laxatives in the back of your dad's car. So? Did he have a... another child, maybe? A baby? I don't think so. You don't think so? He's been acting really weird lately. And then last week, I-I picked up the phone, And he was on there, talking to some woman. What did he say? He just kept saying, "What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do?" We're not supposed to be here, so we have to make this fast. Strip. Again? What is it with you? Nothing metal goes inside the machine. That includes watches, buttons, zippers. You know, this would be a lot less awkward if you stripped, too. When you're done, lie down on the m.R.I. I'm just gonna be next door. Wait, uh, h-Hey. What? I don't know. I, uh... For a guy with so many tattoos, you really are a big baby. You know, it's a good thing all your patients are dead. What is that supposed to mean? It means I have a brain tumor, And I just told you I was scared, And you have no people skills. You're right. I'm sorry. Thank you. You're a big boy. Very brave. I'm taking my pants off now. I don't take my socks off. So, we have this case... The apology line? And it got me thinking about things that I've done in my life That I never apologized for. Yeah, like making me go to the opera? Hey, you said you liked that. No. I was just trying to have sex with you. Well, I was gonna have sex with you no matter what. What? No, I mean like my mom. I-I ran away from home once, And I was gone for six days. And she must have been terrified. And I never said I was sorry. I don't know. Don't you have things you feel guilty about? I kicked a girl out of my car once. It was after a party, And a girl I had been dating for a year... Caught her in the coatroom, making out with some other guy So she was giving me a hard time on the way home, So I pulled over and said, "get out." She cheated on you. I would have thrown her out. No, but it was wrong. It was 2:00 in the morning. It was... the middle of nowhere. I should have took her home, then broke up with her. But it felt good. Here's to things that make you feel good. All right. I'm... I'm a mess. And I think I'm a little drunk. Well, that's good. 'Cause I'm a little turned on. You are? I am. So, what happens if I get really drunk? I may lose my mind. Let's go. Hey, is it supposed to sound like a bag of rocks Being thrown down a flight of stairs? That's better. Are you done? We have to go. Now. What did you find? There's a security guard coming. I can't get caught with you. Oh, don't worry about it. I'll just badge him. I could have my license revoked, not to mention I'll get fired. It's all right. Relax. Duck. What? I just have... What, are you... Come on. Go. Can I just get my pants on, please? Come on. What are you doing?! Let me just put my pants on! This is ridiculous. No, no, no! In here! What's your problem? "Stephanie taft." She called the apology line. And who are you? Stephanie taft, the girlfriend. Hey. Hey, baby. Hey, lover. Geez! What? Don't get all bashful on me now, tiger. Oh, god. Get... Where's beaumont? You really don't remember? Well, she must have left around 1:00, And that's when you called me. I have to say, I was pretty surprised But tickled. Wait. We didn't... Oh, oh, oh, yes, we did. You were very gentle. Oh-Ho-Ho, this is... This is ... This is about the desk. It's about... It's about the desk. Okay, so you're... You're getting me back. It's... It's a prank, right? Beaumont... She... She let you in When I was passed out or... Or something. It's okay, jason. You don't have to pretend. I-I know that the reason you've been riding me All these months is because deep down... You've wanted a piece of this. I'm gonna go... Into the diner... make myself a nice cup of coffee. And, uh... I suggest, If you know what's good for you, eddie, You'll be gone when I get back. Okay. I'm gonna grab a shower first If you want to scrub my back. Jason. Guess not. Oh, that was friendly. I mean, I liked it. Surprising. So, uh, oddly aggressive. Rough, even. I mean, not that I minded. Hey, don't you want to say something? I'm talking a lot. I have to go. Shouldn't we, uh...? No. Hey. What about my, uh, m.R.I.? I mean, uh... you find anything? I'll call you. Can I get you something? No. Thank you. We pulled the phone records for the missed calls And all the people who called the apology line last week. My partner's talking to them right now. Your number came up. That must have been a mistake. No. It says here you called the apology line From your cellphone last tuesday just after midnight. Please don't tell jeremy. He doesn't listen to the tapes? He's a few weeks behind. We get so many calls. What did you apologize for? I love jeremy, But he gets so obsessed with these tapes. Sometimes I think he loves strangers more than he loves me. Why not talk to him directly? Jeremy has nothing but forgiveness For the people who call that stupid answering machine. But he's not so good with real people. I thought if I called the line, He might really listen to me for once. But then I got scared, and I took the tape. You know, Some people believe you have to apologize to god For the mistakes you've made. God's not the one we hurt. It's each other. Hey. Mm. Not so loud. What? You tie one on last night? So, listen. I got ahold of byron maint's credit report. Mm-Hmm. The guy was in serious debt. Turns out the naked guy had a spending addiction. Is that a thing? Apparently. He was in debtors anonymous for six months. His drugstores were all bankrupt, And the bank was about to foreclose on his house. Hey, jason. Um, hot water's a little wonky. You might want to get the heater checked. Detective. Ooh, hot coffee. See you later, hot stuff. Don't say a word. Did he just call you "hot stuff"? Walsh. Yeah. Uh-Huh. Okay. Yeah. Thanks. Wow. Now we know what the baby laxatives were for. I'm sorry. I just cannot get past the "hot stuff." All right, shut up. Listen. Byron maint tested positive for cocaine. Which is cut with baby laxatives. How much coke was in his system? Oh, it wasn't in his system. It was all over his body. The guy was covered in coke. So now we know how he was planning to get out of debt. Byron maint was a drug dealer. Yeah. So, how often was your boss, byron maint, in the store? He came by every week. We talked mopeds. We were both moped enthusiasts. Nice. The clerks at the other store Said that he spent most of his time here. Do you know if byron ordered any merchandise in bulk? Byron? No, he... He was a front-Office guy. We found a box of baby laxatives the back of his car. Baby laxatives? You sound surprised. No, it's just I fired a guy a few months back. I caught him stealing a case of baby laxatives. He was double-Ordering, sneaking the stuff out at night. Do you have a name for that guy? Ralph... Chapelle. 1013 rivington, number 6. "6." Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Hey. How did it go this morning? Oh, you should have seen the look on walsh's face. It was priceless. All right, hey. Hey, I hope you thanked beaumont for letting you in. Oh, done and done. Hey, I, uh... I sold it. I really did. I sold it. There was even a moment Where walsh thought we actually had... sex. That's awesome. Yeah. It was crazy. Nice, buddy. I'm proud of you. Yeah, well, uh, thanks, man. I couldn't have... Couldn't have done it without you. Hey, you know, I talked to walsh earlier. Yeah? And he said, uh, straight out, you won. Yeah? Yep. Said he's throwing in the towel. Wouldn't be surprised if he made you some kind of peace offering. But listen. Walsh is a proud guy. So if he comes to you, offers you a truce, Try be gracious... Don't rub it in his face. You got to be a good winner. Okay. All right. All right. You got me. Hey. Hey. Hey. Where the hell you been? I had sex with a girl. What? Who? The m.E. Last night, this morning. What, the chick with the man hands? No. God, no. The little one... Dr. Crumb... Monica. Nice. Whoa. Nice. Tell me you made her wash her hands first. Yeah, 'cause I was gonna take her tongue out of my mouth To tell her to scrub up. Ew. It's your body. Whatever. Uh, where did you do it, the morgue? Supply closet. Yeah. You and I have never been in a relationship at the same time. It's gonna be... weird. Yeah, I don't know that I'd call it a relationship. What would you call it? I'll get back to you on that. All right. So, davis is dating another woman. Oh, yeah? Yeah. He says I only like him best when he's not being himself. You think I'm a snob? Well, I think it's hard to date civilians. They have jobs. We are the job. They don't get that. Yeah. I like him. I do. I just... The life he wants to lead... Dinner parties and real estate... Ugh. It's so empty to me. There's nothing wrong with having money, case. You know, people just want to live a comfortable life And be happy. Are you happy? Yeah, I am. Because I know myself. I think your problem is, is that you're still two people. You're the cop and the rich girl. And until you can accept where you come from And who you really are, I think it's gonna be pretty hard to be happy. At least I didn't sleep with alvarez. Hey, come on. Ralph chapelle. Number 6. Ralph? Hi. Uh, is this 6? Across the hall. This is 9. Uh, should we maybe... Yeah, that's a lot of paperwork. Have a good night. Mrchapelle, it's the police. Open up. Shots fired! 1013 rivington! Number 6 Go, go, go, go! Do you know who this is? Yeah, it's the bad guy. It's ralph chapelle... The boyfriend of the naked guy's daughter? Please don't tell amanda. You know, looking around, I can kind of guess How byron maint got coated in cocaine. Promise me you're gonna let me talk to amanda Before you tell her, all right? You mean, before we tell her You murdered her father and tried to kill two cops? Yeah, that sounds really bad when you say it out loud. I'm gonna make a deal with you. You tell us the whole story, And we'll talk to amanda for you. Maybe you could get a goodbye squeeze in a conjugal trailer. That's an idea. Okay, listen. Week after I get booted for stealing, right? Mr. Maint from the drugstore comes to me, Wants to make me a deal. He said that he'd front me some cash for coke And that he could get me whatever I need to cut it, Then we'd split the profits. Why would he do that? I don't know. Something about... losing his house... Debts. He seemed pretty desperate. Honestly, I don't really listen to people when they talk. Yeah. Uh, this person that you killed, um, he was naked. Why? Dude, he was always naked. The minute he came into my house, He had to take off his clothes... Like his religion or something. I did not want to look at that, you know? How... How did you meet amanda? I was out one day, and, uh, I see byron. He's got this girl with him. Oh, she's just so beautiful. The top of my head just blows right off. So I figure out where she lives, and follow her. And then figure out where she hangs out, And, uh, get all dressed up, and, uh, I meet her. We started dating. Then two days ago, she invites me to meet her folks. And this morning, her dad shows up, and he's pissed. He says no way is his daughter gonna date a drug dealer. Like, are you... That's just crap, man, Because I'm more than just a drug dealer! You know, I read. I'm a libra. Look, see? See that? Sometimes I make stuff out of wood. Okay, ralph, look here. Uh, you pulled the gun. Dude, the guy took off. He's naked. He's running down the street. What do you want me to do? You know, all I'm thinking the whole time is, "I can't let him tell amanda. I can't... I ca caN't lose amanda." So, uh, you do realize that not in a million years Is she ever gonna kiss you again. Yeah. No, just... You just have him call me back, please? Okay, thank you. Hey, eddie. Sergeant brown asked me to go to this v.I.P. Funeral tonight, Uh, some advisor to the mayor. I'm not good at those things. I mean, is there any way that, uh...

You're a rich girl that's trying to live a blue-Collar life, And I'm a... I'm the guy whose father was a mailman, Who works on wall street. I kind of like that about you. Girls like lisa...
