 Aloha, Second Squad. Be advised, that dispatch is officially declaring Friday. 'Hawaiian shirt day'. Because 'yeah', that's the kind of power I yield. What time is it? It's early. Go back to sleep. Ok. I'm gonna make some breakfast. Are you sure there is no family you want at the wedding? I told you, my family is dead. That is so sad. Well, I have enough family for the both of us.

 Cole. Hey, buddy. Big day. You up? I gotta take this. Ok. Dont forget, we're meeting the caterer at three. At "Fabiani's" on Hudson. Ok. That the Misses? What is she wearing? Why is this a big day, Frank? Hey, did you know that Bobby Fischer played his first match here in New York City? You know Bobby Fischer, right? Chess champion. He was 13. I'm hanging up, Frank. Oh, you dont play chess, now do you, Navan? More of a 'checker"s guy. Well, allow me to... you. The secret to chess... Deep tactics. You size up your opponent, you make your move... And you set the trap. Frank, where are you? And why is it a big day?

 Frank. Frank! The Ninjacchi strikes again... Hey. Anywhere you like. What's' good today? I have pancakes or goulash. Oh, the pancakes. The other one sounds like a shoe. You know, I lived in a trailer once and it had the same wood panels. Yeah? Hey, you play chess? No, I prefer a game with impact. No, I hear you. I hear you. Mix it up a little, few scrapes and bruises. Hey, how about hunting? You like to hunt? Yeah, I do a little hunting... people mostly. Right? The most dangerous game. Have you seen that Jean-Claude Van Damme movie? The guy from "Alien"? Awesome movie. Here you go. Mmh! The last meal. What was that? Hey, have you any ice tea? Yeah, sure. Hey, you are a cop, right? Yeah. Why do you ask? Oh, you just got that look. Been around a few cops in my life. Oh yeah? Here you go. So, do I know you? I don't think so. I have one of those faces though. Familiar. Like somebody you dream about. Right. Hey, you got me one of them syrups? It's just not pancakes without syrup, right? Of course. You're the one I want, Van Damme! Walsh! Walsh... Jason... I got hit... You gonna be ok. I know... Eric. Eric! Yeah? You see that? What? The cash register. Says $ 42.42. Yeah. So? What if this is a sign? Because I am 42. What if the cash register is trying to tell me I'm next? Beaumont's in the hospital, and the whole thing... That's really what you want to...? Impressive. Hey. Where is Sergeant Brown? In the back. I'm actually... Have to check the crime scene. You're right. Sorry. Thank you, Captain. Sir, I canvassed the area. The clerk next door said that he saw the shooter running towards First Avenue. How is Beaumont? Well, she's in surgery. They said clean exit wounds, so that's good. But she's lost a lot of blood. Did you know about her and Walsh? Yes, I do. Where is Cole? We tried to call him but he is not answering his phone. Walsh is at the hospital with the sketch artist. I'm making you lead on this. This is where you say, "Thank you, I'm honored. I will not let you down." Thank you. I'm honored. I'm also the least experienced detective on the squad, sir. Banks! Delahoy! Look... Sir. Want to be honest? Let's be honest. I am worried. Three months ago, Walsh's partner gets killed. Today, somebody takes a shot at Walsh. I need to know if the two things are connected. But I do not want to keep it quiet. I'm on it. Hey, what's up, sergeant? Somebody just robbed the M15 bus. Yeah, well, we would prefer to work the shooting. Understood. But this guy needs to be caught. The last thing the city needs is a bus full of hostages. So get your asses down to the scene. Alvarez will meet you there. You take his lead on this. What? Why does that guy to be in charge? Because he's far more professional than either of you. It's true. He's got us on that one. Tell us what happened on the bus. A Puerto Rican male gets on the bus at Houston and Second... agitated, talking to himself. Perp pulls a hand grenade in hand and tells the driver to keep going. A hand grenade? Yup. The guy goes from passenger to passenger, taking wallets, watches. Jumps off here. At Fourth Street and Second Avenue: 42. Tell me that is not a sign, tell me. You know what I see? I see Second Avenue and Fourth street: 24, ok? Not 42. Ok, this is how we gonna play it. Split into three and interview the passengers. Just make sure that the notes are legible, this time. Okay. Can you read this? That's disgusting. We got a hold of all the passengers. Well, that's it? We'll be done before lunch. No. Those are the interpreters. Those are the passengers. All 42 of them. Come on! Hi. Hi. How is Beaumont? Not good. They are operating. So what are we doing? Dark brown hair, it's greasy. Worn back. This would be a lot easier if I could sit in front. The CIC found bullets in the diner wall. And also picked up some fingerprints of the counter. What, you do not like hospitals? No, I'm fine. The nurses come out every 15 minutes, giving me updates. Yes, but that's the point, you know... Go inside, you pace, show your support. She's in surgery, ok? I mean there's doctors there... I rather just wait in the car, if that's alright with you. Yeah... I... What I was trying to say was... you know, if you are wanted to talk about... how you are feeling. So, Brown made you lead on this? Yeah. That's good. Listen, Walsh, did you recognise the shooter? Maybe someone you put away, or someone with a grudge. No, no. Hey, Cole! I just heard. I was at church, they make you turn off your phone. She is in surgery, stomach wound. The doctors aren't happy. My phone was off. How could this happen? All right. How's this? Yeah, that's him. It's him? It's him. Yeah... Do you recognise him? No, I have never seen him before. I should call Allison's mother. What? Nothing. Ok, I gonna take the sketch down to the shop. Get the ball rolling. Let's go. I was not always the pillar of virtue you see before you. You stole an armored car? I am Navan Granger. Don't tell. Dispatch, this is 418. Go ahead, 418. I will need a private line to the FBI. FBI. Yes, it's Detective Jason Walsh, from second precinct of New York. I need some records pulled from Texas and Oklahoma... Anything you got on a Navan Granger. AKA Henry Cole. Ask Mr. Park to describe the bus robber. Ask him what color his eyes were. Blue. Blue? Really? She talk for like an hour. Mr. Mbuto says the robber had a bomb. Actually, he said grenade. I am familiar with the tribal language of Yoruba. Your mother is a hooker. Mr Mbuto! It's cool. Late twenty, olive skin, kinky hair. He yelled a lot. I think he was upset about something. And he had something round in his hand. People said it was a grenade. Must have been frightened. No, maybe a little disappointed. Wait. What do you mean... "disappointed"? I have to tell you he's gonna rob another bus today at 2 o'clock. He said that? No. I am psychic. You're... Clairvoyant. I've had visions of the future since I was 13. It's not as glamorous as it sounds. It's pretty annoying, actually. So, I am confused. Are you saying that you knew that the bus was gonna be robbed when you got on? Does the number 42 mean anything to you? What? I'm getting a very strong feeling. The number 42. It's tied to your fate. I have to... We're done here. Thanks for coming in. More faxes. I am a nurse, you know, not your secretary. Detective Walsh? Hi. She is out of surgery. The bullet missed major organs. They are taking her to recovery. You can see her, if you like. All right. Thank you. Thanks. Can't go in? No. And you? No. I have a thing about hospitals. The kind of people tend to die in them. Ya. Hey. How is Beaumont? She's out of surgery. She's in recovery. That's good. You're going in? Are you crazy? Not going in there. It's like a petridish. I've just been waiting in the car. Sounds good. Ok. Suspect is a white male, mid twenties. Last seen running towards 1st Avenue. We are pulling files on all Walsh's past cases, but our working theory is attempted robbery. We are also checking for similar cases in the neighborhood. Oh, we... we're also green lit for overtime, so... make sure to call home and let them know it's gonna be a late night. Thank you. Good. All right. I'm going to make a phone call. Thank God you're ok. Stop. I'm working. I heard on the radio that a female detective was shot. And you weren't answering your cell, so... I called the station, and they wouldn't tell me anything. That's too much information. Clearly I'm fine. And I'm also in the middle of something. Ok, now I feel stupid. No, don't feel stupid. Shraeger? Frank Lutz. Go back to work. I'll call you later. Frank, lt's me. I'm serious, you call me the minute you get this. Where's Frank? Has anyone seen Frank? Frank Lutz? Wait. What is that? What? That song, I keep hearing it. Are you crazy, man. Back off me. Frank? Hi honey. You didn't forget about our appointment with the caterer. No honey, no, I didn't forget. Ok, great. So... Okay. I can't really talk right now. Ok. I got to go. Ok, I love you honey. Ok, I love you too. This is Cole. Hey, it's Casey. How is Beaumont? What? Aren't you at the hospital? No. I had to do something first. Listen, we ID'd the shooter. He pulled a camera store job last week. Goes by the name of Frank Lutz. I'm heading down there now to check it out. Cole? Yeah... Okay, thank you. Hey. Where have you been? Hospital. Did you go yet? Of course. Did you put together a list of guys with prior bus robberies? Yes. Ok. What about reaching out to metro? Yeah. And I got a call to army surplus stores, gun shops, any place you can get a grenade. My question is... what are you doing? I'm in charge. Hey. Hey! We were supposed to have lunch. Right. Sorry, I got caught up. You know, when you stand a girl up it sends a message that you're not interested. No, no. God. No. No. I'm so so interested. It's just... Beaumont is in the hospital and... Do you believe in fate? Not like that. It's cheesy. I mean... I'm asking, do you feel like you have a destiny? Oh absolutely. I am a very spiritual person. All right. I got this witness in a case, right? And she... she says... You know I'm 42? I am 42. She says the number 42 is very important to me. You want to talk about the number 42? Well, we'll talk about the number 42. You know, in judaism god's true name has 42 letters. Did you know that? Really? Yeah. And in numerology, the number 4 means "creation", 2 means "union". I also speak french. Do you see what you missed at lunch? "Create Union". That's very nice. In Chinese, the number 42 sounds like easy death. It's true. So, what are you two cutiepies talking about? Oh well, your friend stood me up for lunch, and when I asked him why he said a psychic told him the number 42 was important to him. Really? Cause I could have told him that. So what else did the psychic say? She said the guy was gonna rob another bus at 2 o'clock. That's a shame, but it is 2.15. Banks, Delahoy. We have another bus robbery. M31. Saddle up. I don't know about you guys, but I just got chills. Still not made it inside? No. We ID'd the shooter. Goes by the name of Frank Lutz. That's him. Fingerprints match a camera store heist from last week. But you know what's weird? The owner told me that there is usually a patrol car that's set across the street, in front of the embassy of Andorre. Andorre... Yeah. Home planet of the Ewoks. Well, that's wrong. Andorra... Yeah, let's go with that one. Anyway, the strangest part of all is... that the night of the robbery, a Detective Chase from the Second Squad, called in and had the vehicle moved. There is no 'Chase' in our house. Exactly. Does that mean anything to you? Where is Cole? At the precinct. Why? You should think about going in there. She's not even awake yet. Yeah... well you know, if it was my boyfriend, I'd like him to be there when I woke up. Well, I'm not her boyfriend. Good to know. Ok. So let me get this straight. Two buses get robbed in one day, and you are in both of them. I told you he'd rob another one. You realise you predicted a crime. From where I stand, that makes you an accomplice. It's no accident, you know... the fact that you are here... that this is your case. I saw you in my visions. Hey, lady... look... you need to cut out all the new-age crap. And tell me you end up on that bus. He gonna rob another one around 5 o'clock but this time he won't get away. You will catch him. He will go to jail. Go N.Y.P.D.! Which bus? I don't know yet, but he's gonna kill someone. But don't feel bad. I've had a good life. You? He's gonna kill... It's my time. I've seen it... shattered glass, smoke, people screaming. You can't fight fate. Yeah you can. If you think you gonna die on a bus, you don't go on the damned bus! Detective Banks, trying to cheat your own destiny is as pointless as wearing a bullet-proofed vest. Or wrapping your desk in foam. This is a scam. You trying to play me? How does this work? You are going through my trash? Follow me to the office? What? You gonna arrest me. Because it makes you feel better to believe that I am a criminal and not a psychic. You are damned right. I'm gonna arrest you. Hey. She's alive! What happened? There was a customer at the diner, who had a gun, and the shot came through the wall. Sergeant. We can leave the whole "inter-office romance and... how you are supposed to clear that with me first" conversation for later. Who sent muffins? Alvarez. He does know I was shot in the stomach, right? Allison? Hey. It's ok... I'm ok. I'm so sorry. Err, I'll be right back. Come on. What's wrong with you? You don't cry. You make fun of her, you... you tell her how hot she looks with the tubes coming out of her, anything. But don't be a woman. No, you are right, I'm sorry. And stop apologizing. This is the job. Cops get shot... Not your fault. Sergeant, I have to tell you something. You gonna take it? Yeah... I'm sorr... I got it. Where are you? Hey, buddy. It's over, Frank. They know who you are. Haha, nothing's over. You see, they make their moves. We make ours. Maybe you did not hear me. They ID'd you, Frank. The entire city is looking for you. I am turning myself in. Navan, hey. This is the end game. We still got a place to make. Maybe I was presumptuous, maybe I have moved my queen out a little early. This is not a game, Frank. You killed Kowalski and you put my partner into hospital. I'm shutting you down. Hey, aren't you supposed to be some place right now tasting on wedding cakes? Yeah, that place on Hudson. I tell you what... Amy sure does look disappointed that you stood her up. There aint nothing sader... than a bride-to-be tasting wedding cakes by herself. Don't you touch her, Frank! Looks like she does enjoy that devil's fruit though. You think she does? Enjoy the devil's fruit? Please, Frank. 'Please' what? You are acting like I am the problem here, Navan. Every time I help you out, you say "Thank you, Frank?" "I could not do it without you, Frank?" No. You bust my nuts! Well, I tell you what, son. You are going to show me some appreciation. 20,000 Small bills. Pier 6. Brooklyn Navy yard. You got one hour. Alvarez asked me to voucher for that cash he pulled in on that drug bust last week. 22,000 in hundreds. Now you know the drill. You copy each bill face up stamp it into evidence and initial in the lower corner. I am sorry for the way Detective Banks treated you, miss Goodman. You are... you are free to go. You got to admit, though... it's quite a coincidence that you were on both buses. Yeah, it was bad luck, I guess. You sure you can't stick around, look at some pictures? I have a date with destiny. Can't be late. What's up? Alvarez let the psychic go. Yeah. So... Her story checked out. She is not an accomplice. We can't release her. What if she is right? What if she gets on another bus and he kills her? What you gonna do? Drive her everywhere she has to go for the rest of her life? It's her choice, man. No, that's the whole point. It's not her choice. It's fate. She has hers, you got yours, I got mine. Yeah, well, now. We got a positive ID on the bus robber. Six witnesses picked him out of the book. Louis Diaz, 28 years old. The guy spent six months in Bellevue. Apparently he also hears voices, which is awesome. And I believe it's our fate to go out and arrest this guy. She said you can't fight destiny. That's not like accepting it. She's more like embraces it. I think she wants to die. Why would she want to die? I don't know. But I am going to find out. Hi, Cole. I can't, I am late for... Yeah, I just got a word. She's gonna be ok. Yes. You're all right? Yeah, thank you. What was that all about? Come on. I think Cole knows Frank Lutz. What? This is Frank Lutz's arrest history. And this is everything I pulled on Navan Granger. Navan Granger. Why do I know that name? It was in a file in Kowalski's storage locker. Look at the picture. Cole? Hm. He changed his name nine years ago. See if you can figure out why. He stole an armored car? At La Grange, Texas. At the time, Frank Lutz was living one town over. So I think Frank Lutz was Cole's accomplice. Uh... that's a stretch... Oh, I'm not done. Now, both Cole and Lutz were in Tulsa in October of 1998 and then again in El Paso in 1999. Now they are both in New York City. I can't prove it, but they are connected. Do you think that Cole had that black-and-white moved so that Lutz could rob the camera store? Yeah, I think they are still working together. I don't understand. Why... why would Lutz try to kill you? Well you know, the only thing I could think is that I know Cole's secret. Cole and I talked about it three months ago. Right after you and I found the file on him in Kowalski's storage locker. Because Kowalski knew. Now he's dead. Lutz. Wait a second. If... if Lutz killed Kowalski... That means that Cole must have known about it. Yeah. Walsh, we have to tell Sergeant Brown. No. Why not? Look, I had a three-hour diner with Beaumont last night. You know what she talked about the entire time? Cole's wedding. She loves him. And this would kill her. I thought you weren't her boyfriend. I'm not. 12-year-olds have boyfriends. I am her man. What do you want to do? Keep an eye on Cole. We follow him. And if I am right he leads us right to Lutz. He just left out the door, he could be going anywhere. Which is why I put a GPS tracker in his pocket. If he meets up with Lutz, oh, we are gonna be there. N.Y.P.D.! Clear! Really? Louis Diaz is what you might call a bus enthusiast. Yeah. No kidding. A slightly disturbed bus enthusiast. Thanks. Hey, I was right. It's not fate. Eh? Jennifer Goodman, the psychic. Her husband died last year. I think she wants to die. I think she misses her husband and she's been riding these buses because she wants this guy to kill her. That's not fate. And if it's not fate, then I can change it. And if I can change her fate... I can change mine. These are all color coded. Different lines, different... different days, different colors. Here is the M31, that's the one that he's robbed this afternoon. This is the M15 from this morning. They are all marked in black. And I got three here... 86... 27, the 2... But no trace of the M-you-know-what. Right, Leo? Where is Leo? Right there. Shit. Casey. See you at the car. Where are we? We tied Lutz to a robbery last week. A camera store. Not connected to Kowalski? I don't think so. You don't think so? I thought we understood each other. I thought you'd gonna tell me the truth. Sir, do you trust me? Is that some kind of joke? No. I am the most trustworthy person you will ever meet, and I promise: if I find anything that I think will hurt you or this precinct, I will tell you. But until then... let me do my job. He is turning left. He is speeding up. I know. Hey! Hey buddy, you get back? He is heading South. Towards the ship yard. Frank. That my money? It's funny how things turn out, huh, Navan? I mean, you were my protege, remember? Grasshopper? Dumb kid straight out of Foster care? Remember that first lock you tried to pick? And that one legged man, he chased you six blocks? I mean, he was fast for a cripple, though. I will admit that. I am confused and alarmed here, Navan. Hell, buddy. You double crossing me? I asked around, Frank, at the park, and you know what they told me? You suck at chess. Those are the remarks of bitter acrimonious men. This is Detective Cole. I have the suspect in custody. Navan! Hey! Think this through. I go down, you go down. I mean, that's just math. It's okay. I deserve to go to jail for what I've done. Well, I don't! I don't! But whatever I ever take was mine. Not all of us get to start over, son. Not all of us get new lifes, and pretty girls that look at us like we're angels. Some of us get dirt on our stockings. We live out in the cold. You made your choices, Frank. Now I'm making mine. Brooklin Navy Yard. Suspect is on pier 6. You give me no choice, Navan. I am pulling my gun. I am reaching for it. Now I don't want to... But I got no choice. Don't do it. Ok, ok. Now that's good. Now, we are both reasonable men. I will shoot you, Frank. I know. It's okay. Everything's gonna be okay. Police! Do not move! What? Gamera, Rodan, Mothra, Megagodzilla. How are you doing? I just ran four blocks. I hate running. I could have a heart attack, or hit by a car. That's my life. You know, I've got a waterless toilet... so if I pass out in it, I won't drown... Hedorah, Megalon, Orga, Baragon. But... I'm running to catch the bus and I think... What am I doing? I am not happy. I am miserable. I am afraid all the time. That's not life. My guess is just: Get it over with... Stop fighting. Ghildrah, Yonggary, yog! I want to show their money! I knew it. But... I can't let you blow these people up. Hey, stop the bus! Stop the bus! Why don't you give me that grenade? Louis, give me the grenade. Everybody off this bus now! Hey, Daniel. What are you doing? Wait, he... No, he threw... And then I... It's a fake. A fake? It could have happened to anybody. I am alive. I am alive. I am alive. Nice work, detective. I am putting you on for recommendation. It was never fate. Look, I know about your husband. I know you want to die to be with him, but'... Fate does not work that way. I saw what I saw. Do you know what I saw? I saw fate get it's ass kicked. Ooya! Hey, buddy. You know, about La Grange. About Tucson. I know that you and Lutz were partners. I know you called the Sixth last week Had a patrol car moved so Lutz could rob a camera store. And I am pretty sure, that you and Frank Lutz were involved in the murder of Burt Kowalski. Jason... I'm not done. I also know that you're a good man... you're a good cop. That you truely want to change. So here's what I think. I think you moved to New York, started a new life. I think, Frank Lutz found you, and blackmailed you into helping him. I think Kowalski found out about your past, you panicked, you told Lutz, and Lutz had Kowalski killed. When I found out, Lutz tried to kill me. I never meant for any of this to happen. That is what I know. Here is what I gonna do: Nothing. And the reason why I am doing nothing is lying in a hospital bed, uptown. If I was any kind of a man, I would be there with her right now. But instead I am here talking with you. So, Cole, keep your nose clean. Because I will be watching you. It's done. So, are we good? Yes, we are good. You sure? You look, uh... a bit tired. You should get some sleep. You! Up now. Where are we going? Supply closet. Detective... I like this new tape attitude. There have to be rules. Rules? Yes, I grew up without any rules, and it did not work. So... if we want this to work... I... uh... I want this to work. Then there have to be rules. I'm listening. Rule number one: You can't leave me 40 messages at work. Rule number two: you can't come by the precinct without prearranged plans. And what if you forgot your lunch and I need to bring it to you? I don't bag a lunch. So I agree to that then. Rule number three: You have to respect what I do. I do respect you, Casey, my God, I think you are amazing and brave... But... No. No "but". My parents think this is a phase. They think I am just rebelling. But I love what I do, and I am good at it, ok? So whoever I date has to understand that. Can I agree to work on that? Sure. Are there any more rules? No. Good. Want to come in and watch "Fistful of Dollars"? It's Clint Eastwood week. Yes. Yes I do. Second squad. This is dispatch. Sending out a very special dedication to a very special someone. Hey, buddy! Check out I am not wearing. Emmh. Hey, we need to talk, man. Yeah, ok, wait. What's that? You got rid of all your antibacterial stuff. Colds, flues, airborn pathogens... bring 'em on, baby! I am not afraid anymore. Nothing. Leo, there was a traffic accident 20 minutes ago. A metro bus overturned. Jennifer Goodman, your... your psychic, was on it. She's dead. Did you get the muffin? 50 muffins. That's a lot of muffins. Well, I'm not that good with emotionality. So I... send pastries. Well, you're here now. That's what matters. Knock, knock. Hey. Err... I gonna... see you later. Where have you been? Catch some bad guys. How'd that go? He's dead. Listen, Al, I need to tell you something. When I was 22, I had a girlfriend. She was murdered. But she did not die right away, she was... in a hospital for a week. Jason, I am so sorry. So I need you to get better. And get out of here. Ok? Ok. I promise. Well, now move over.
