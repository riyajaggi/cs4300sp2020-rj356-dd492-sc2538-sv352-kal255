 2nd squad, this is dispatch. Are you sitting down? Nobody move! All right, what do we got? This is a robbery! Get down! Get down on the ground! Witness called it in. Four guys with masks. They went in there about five minutes ago. Got it. What do you want to do? Well... I could use some waffles. My breakfast didn't stick.

 What? No, seriously. Come on. Walsh, new partnership. Are you a "three and then go" guy or "go on three"? Which one? Yeah, I don't count. See, that's good to know. Police! Don't move! I don't know. It's just different. Different how? It's hard to explain. I've worked three other precincts, and none of them were like the 2nd precinct. Maybe it's the criminals. See, we get a lot of oddballs and nutjobs. Or maybe it's just us... the cops.

 I don't know. You know, when I worked vice undercover, they would call me "Pete Rose." You know why they called me "Pete Rose?" Well, either you like to slide headfirst or you're the utility player. Exactly. See, I can do everything... the interviews, the research, dress up like a hooker. So whatever you need, just tell me. Okay, I will. Well, you know, in the meantime, just keep your knees bent and roll with things, because at the 2nd squad, nothing is what you think it is. Whoa! Thanks for that! 2nd squad, 1031 in progress at Madeline's dress shop on Essex. Dispatch respectfully reminds all responding officers that she is a size two. You couldn't have waited? For what? The guy's swinging a sword. At least let me put a couple of bullets in him, soften him up. I was in the moment. What's this? Guy tried to rob a cash-only restaurant with a sword. And Einstein here charges him. Okay. Yo, man, I got rights. Shut up. Beaumont, Cole, robbery just came in. Pawnshop on Delancey and Chrystie. Get over there. We're on it, sarge. Hey, you can't talk to me, you know. I'm only 16. Should have thought about that before you went cash-skiing on Essex Street. 36. 41. What was that about? Wouldn't you like to know. There were four of them. They all had pantyhose on their heads. One guy didn't know how to do it, though, So the second leg was hanging off of his face like a trunk. How much did they take? $8,000, maybe $10,000 in cash and jewelry. And the victim, he worked here? Yeah, Pete. We keep a baseball bat behind the counter. He went for it, and the little guy shot him. He couldn't have been more than 5'1". Is there anything else you can tell us about the robbers? But they left this behind. A... an onion. Yeah. Said it was a souvenir. "Souvenir for what?" I said. That guy with the trunk, he said, "You're a piece of New York history now." Whatever the hell that means. What's up, sarge? Yeah. Um, where are we at with Walsh? Uh, sir, we've only been partners for one week. Kowalski was dirty. And somebody killed him. Walsh was his partner. Internal Affairs wants to do an investigation. I told them I can handle it, but I need your help. Sir... Look, I like Walsh. He's the real deal. But I can't protect him if I don't know his story. His story? Every cop has a story... why they do what they do. What their story is dictates what kind of police they are. Now, can you help me? Ready to take a run at the kid? Uh, um, yeah. James Boorland. You're 16. What are you doing robbing a bank? My client's a minor. You have to charge him as one. But bank robbery's a federal crime. Throw in a loaded weapon, shooting at a cop, now you're looking at mandatory sentencing. I didn't shoot at anybody. Doesn't matter. Shots were fired. Please. I don't want to go to jail. We pulled your records. James Boorland... honor student at stuyvesant high school, science club, math club, debate club. What... what was this, like a field trip? Look, I've got the S.A.Ts on Saturday. You think I'll still be able to take them? Yeah, I'm gonna go with no on that. I didn't even want to do it, but... But what? Whose idea was it, James? James? Hey, Walsh, you got a sec? I'll take him. All right? Yeah. I just wanted to say, no hard feelings about last week. Last week? Yeah. The wild goose chase you sent me on. You know, Shabu Shabu. Ah. I know that you were probably just feeling upset about Kowalski, so... No, I was just trying to teach you a lesson. Oh. How long you been working here, Eddie? It'll be a year on friday. Ah, see, how wonderful. What's Delahoy's first name? Um... Eric. Eric. How old's Banks? Banks. Well, he's... 42. He talks about it all the time, Eddie... The year he's gonna die. Yeah, I... I must have missed that. You see, this is what I'm talking about, eddie. You've been here a year, and you don't know anything about us. You're right... I should familiarize myself with people's personnel files. No, Eddie, maybe you just come have a beer with us sometime. Stop being such a snob. Is that my windbreaker? No. Yeah, it is. The lining's ripped. Okay, it's your windbreaker. So what? What's... what's wrong with you? Wh... what do you need my windbreaker for? You got your own windbreaker. Someone should be recording this conversation for insomniacs everywhere. No, no, no, no, no. It's the point, okay. A man's jacket, you know? His windbreaker. I mean, these things are sacred. It's lucky, okay? It's a lucky windbreaker. It's the one you wore when you got shot. I didn't get shot. Yeah, you did. Two barrels, straight in the face, and it misses. It has nothing to do with my outerwear, okay? It was a misfire. It was a miracle. Right. Okay. Take it off. Really? Hand it over. All right. All right, another robbery just came in. Who's catching? Donovan, Dobbs? What's that? What is that? It's an onion. I know what it is. What's it doing on your desk? Perp left it at that pawnshop robbery. Four jokers with pantyhose on their heads. Oh, no. They left an onion behind? Why? What do you think that means? It means they're back. Who? The Boorlands. I should have known. Sarge, did you say Boorlands? Yeah, the oldest family of criminals in New York. They like to leave an onion. Hey, sarge, our guy's a Boorland. The samural in there... that's Frank Boorland. Yeah, the kid we just nabbed in the armed robbery's a Boorland, as well. Oh, crap. So, the Boorlands are what, organized crime, like the mafia? No, they're more like disorganized crime. The Boorlands have been breaking the law in this city since before there were cops to catch them. My dad arrested Boorlands, his dad before him. They're petty thieves and thugs. They can't agree on anything. Another robbery, sarge. Houston and second. Ladies and gentlemen, drop everything. We have ourselves a crime spree. Hey, weren't you in the village people? Where's the cowboy and the indian? Hey, buddy. Nice suit. They make you wear that? What did I tell you, Frank? You can't come here. Well, the apartment you got me smells like farts, and the tv only gets four channels. So read a book. Right. That's a good one. Hey, how about I call the service and I order us a couple females? I don't know about you, but I could go for a little pecan sally right about now... you follow me? I don't do that anymore, Frank. God has shown me a better path. Yeah, but you didn't call god, did you, Navan? You called me. Uh-oh. Go back to Texas, Frank. Hell, I will if you will, buddy. Steal a car... road trip. Shh! We'll be there in three days. We'll go crazy. We'll get back what we gave up. Huh? No? Last chance. I'm walking away. I'm getting into trouble. I'm gone. Attention. All personnel, report to the briefing room immediately. Hey, Eric. Eric Delahoy. How you doing? Okay, people, let's focus. Walsh? Yeah. I'm sorry. Shraeger. Oh. All right, we have eight confirmed Boorland robberies in the lower east side. We also have reports of armed robberies from the 13th, 15th, and 6th precincts. We don't know why the Boorlands are on a crime spree. This is a family that, historically, can't agree on what time it is. But they're out in force today, and they're shooting. So we got to shut them down, fast. So far we have two of the Boorlands in custody... James and Frank. That means there's still 20 or more Boorlands out on the streets, including the worst one. Which is Nick Boorland, 27. He's got 10 arrests, two convictions for armed robbery, assault, attempted murder. He's also 5'1" and has a real Napoleon complex. Yeah, if I had to bet, I'd say he's the one that killed the clerk at the pawnshop. Finally, this is... this is Mike Boorland. He's the head of the family. He's the father of Nick and James Boorland. He got out of sing sing last year. Okay, now, the Boorlands like to hang out at this ping-pong hall on varick street. So that's where we look first. Delahoy and Banks, you're gonna be left behind on this one. What? Why? Command called. You haven't turned in your fives for three months. Come on, you're gonna bust our satchel over paperwork? Just do it. Everybody else, let's hit 'em hard. NYPD! Show me your hands! Hands up! Show me your hands! All right, everybody chinese get out. Everybody else move against the wall. Let's go! All right, we're looking for Boorlands. You guys know the drill. Pull your wallets out and hold your I.D.S up next to your face. Clear? Gus Boorland. Rich Boorland. Futz. Shep. Yvonne. Yvonne? My mother was french. It's the big dog. Mike Boorland. You okay? You don't look so good. Food poisoning. Don't eat the dumplings under the bridge. Okay. So, where's your son nick? Screw you. Okay. Let's bring 'em all in. We'll sort it out at the station. Got him? Nice. Yeah, it helps when the people you're talking to are sideshow-stupid. 56. Nice try. 73. You serious? Where did you go? We're supposed to be doing paperwork. Just in time. Hey, if you had to guess, what do you think the salty egg vegetable sponge liver pig soup tastes like? Sponge. All right, and what about chicken ear in jade liquid? I guess I got two questions there. It's part of the job, Eric... Paperwork. It's a little creepy, though, don't you think, I mean, all these files? You know, names, addresses, pictures. You know who did a lot of paperwork? Who's that? The nazis. Come on. What's the matter? It's blank. I got a blank fortune. Okay. You know what that means, though? Leo, don't start. A blank fortun it means I got no future because I'm gonna be dead at 42, like my father. I can't breathe. Relax. Okay, look, I'm sure mine's exactly the same, okay? Come on, what is it? Is it blank? "Follow the dove." What are they, chinese hippies? What does that mean? You know what? Knowing you, something crazy. Leo, you got a problem with me? Yes. You know, ever since you got shot, You have been acting like a nut. Leo, I didn't get shot. You kicked open a door. A guy pointed a shotgun at your head and pulled the trigger. And yet I'm fine and about to enjoy... some big bowl gold mushroom cowboy meat. You're very funny. Okay. Seriously. Come on. What's going on with you? I have a brain tumor. What? Oh, man. Hey. I'm sorry. And I'm kidding. Okay. I'm not kidding. Are you serious? No. I'm sorry. That's enough. I am a little constipated, though. No, you know, that's not... Come on. Come on. Let's go. Where you going? Maybe if we go look at the buckshot in the wall, that will help you snap out of it. Come on. Let's go. Lawyer. Lawyer. I'm sorry. What did you say? I said I want a... Yeah, yeah, I... I didn't hear him, either. How are you feeling, Mike? You don't look so good. I'm fine. Hey, not to make this weird, but can I get your autograph? Truthfully, the Boorlands are legends around here, you know. Oldest crime family in New York. Yeah. Screw the italians. My great-great-great-grandfather stole the 24 bucks the dutch paid the indians for Manhattan. Well, you must make him proud. A bank robbery and a pawnshop in one morning. I don't know anything about that. I've been throwing up since yesterday. Did you see your son James? He's in holding. Good kid, honor student. He robbed his first bank this morning. You must be proud. You got kids? No. Then what do you know? We know we're can try him as an adult. He can get 25 to life. Mike, what's going on? Why the sudden crime spree? Hmm. My father... he was a great man. He could talk anybody into anything. And the ladies... they loved him. He had a 2x4 between his legs. People called him "The Lumberjack." Cops cornered him in an alley in Queens. He died on his feet like a man. That's all anybody could ask for... to die like a man. Is that what you want for your son? James is a good kid. He knows family comes first. Hmm. You know, you still got another son out there, Mike. And a lot of jumpy cops. We can stop this all right now, you know, save his life maybe. Read my lips. I want a... lawyer. I still don't know what we're doing here, Leo. Listen to me, okay? You almost died in there. Deal with it and stop being so reckless. See, this is why I never got married. What? What does that even... 'Cause I got to listen to this all day long, and then I'm gonna go home... I'll tell you what... I changed my mind, okay? I'm gonna do the paperwork. Let's go. What? No. Five minutes. Five minutes. In and out. I won't talk to you anymore. I won't bother you. You'll stop yapping? Yes. Okay. Okay? Yeah. Right. No. You start stopping now. What are you, my mo... now!

Alvarez caught another Boorland. I was gonna watch the interview. Want to join? Yeah. You okay? Yeah, yeah. Just sometimes the violent ones get to me. It's cause you're so nice. Sometimes it helps if you're a bastard on this job. Well, I'm not that nice. Come on, Henry. I'm not. Henry, you go to church every day. I once saw you carry a homeless guy three blocks to the E.R. Trust me, you're probably the nicest guy in the city of New York. Come on. Casey. Davis? Hi. This is, uh, where you work. He's with me. Yeah, here, I got this. This is, uh, the cop shop, huh? All right, go in here. Wow. Forceful. What are you doing here? How long have I been managing your trust fund? You still can't keep an appointment. It was cute when you were 20. I need you to keep your voice down. People don't know here I'm rich. Do you? You have less interest in money than anyone I've ever met. Thank you. It's not a compliment. Do you know the story of Cinderella? No. I'm an idiot. Well, Cinderella was a beautiful woman who was made to feel ugly by the rest of her family. And in this scenario, I'm Cinderella? No, the money is cinderella. You're the evil stepmother who's making her feel like trash. I'm not gonna tell you what to do with your money. You want to give it all away, we'll set up a foundation. We'll give it away, but stop hiding. I'm not hiding. I'm a police detective in one of the biggest cities in the world. Ooh. If you tell him I'm rich, I'll kill you. I have a gun. I'm sorry.

I think it's time that we have the conversation. The conversation? The porn-stash conversation. Big porn fan, are you? No, like, listen, the... the "what do we do if something happens" conversation. Hey. What? When Kowalski died, you went straight to his locker and you got rid of all of his contraband. We've been partners a week, and you're thinking about me dying? What, so too early? Ah, I suppose not. All right, so, what do you got? Drugs, guns, a nazi plate under the bed? No, I have a diary that I wouldn't want anyone to read. Your diary. Mm-Hmm. "Davis was mean to me today." That kind of thing. No. Sexual... stories... about me and, you know... Okay. Fine. Where is it? It's in a lockbox in my closet. Okay. Great. No. What about you? What about me? What... what am I hiding? Wh... what do you think, Casey? Well, I... Look, I... I don't figure you as the sexual-deviant type or... I know what it is. You write poetry. You're good. Don't forget it. Hey, uh, sarge wants us to keep all the Boorland files together. Okay. So, Allison, you're adopted, huh? What? Who told you that? Oh, it's in your personnal file. You read my personnel file? Oh, no, no, no, no. I was... I was trying to get to know you better, but... Hey, I think I need a doctor. Dad! Dad! Get in here! Get a doctor! Dad, dad! Dad, are you okay?! Come on! Do something!

I want a guard on this guy every second. Yeah. You got it, sarge. Sarge. Not now. No, I need to talk to you. I got to talk to you. What? I want a new partner. Leo, I don't have time for this. Look, I'm serious. I can't handle him anymore. The guy is reckless. He almost killed me again today. You make a good team. No, we used to. I'm telling you this, sarge, you either assign Delahoy to someone else, or I'm gonna have to quit. How's that? What? It's a joke. It's not nice to make fun of people's fears, Eric. Lighten up, blondie. Hey, Cole. You seen Beaumont? She's taking Mike Boorland to the hospital. You want me to give her a message? Yeah, tell her "119" for me, would you? That's it? For now. What do you want, Frank? Hey, buddy. Don't hang up. I need to borrow your handcuffs, I met this, uh, puerto rican girl. Not a chance. Ho, wait up. Wait up. The truth be told, I have this guy that owes me some money and I want to put a good scare in him. I'm hanging up, Frank. Okay, okay, but you should know, I'm playing chess right now. But later, who knows? Okay, don't go anywhere. I'll be right there. So, Beaumont just called. And she said Mike Boorland has end-stage renal failure. They're giving him dialysis, but without a transplant, he'll be dead in three months. That's it! What? Wow. She's spunky. You have no idea. Is my dad okay? No. His kidneys are failing. But you knew that, didn't you? I've been trying to figure out what you were doing in the bank this morning. Now I know. Your father needs a kidney transplant. He doesn't have the insurance. What does that cost, 200,000, 300,000 bucks? James. Is that what you guys were doing this morning, huh? Is that what you're trying to do? Trying to steal enough money to get your dad's surgery? What are we supposed to do? We can't just let him die. I... I get it with them, but you're... you're different. I'm not that different. Yeah. Yeah, you are. A.P. classes, charity work. I bet no one in your family even knows what an S.A.T. is. Listen, crime is their solution. It does not have to be yours. He's my dad. Knock, knock. Excuse me. Uniforms just pinned down four Boorlands at a jewelry store on West Broadway. We got to go. All right, what do we got? We got four Boorlands, six hostages. H.S.T. is handling two other robberies uptown. I got a line inside, but little Nicky's in a real mood. Where's Cole? He said he had a lead. I've been trying to reach him, but he's not answering his phone. Well, now that we know what they want, we gonna, uh, try to call in there, get 'em to come out? Why don't I promise Nick that we'll get his dad the operation, trick him into coming out here? No, they'll never buy it. This the line in? Yeah, but I've already got a rapport with the guy, so I should probably... Thanks. What? Nick, this is Detective Walsh. I just want to let you know that I talked to your mom. She's on the way to the hospital to see your dad. You should know, I don't like cops... you're all bigots. How do you mean? Did you know you have to be 5'4" to be a cop in New York? Well, why don't I talk to somebody, see if I can change that. Would you want to be a police officer, Nick? No. It's the principal. Little guys are just as tough as big guys... tougher probably. All right, look, let's be straight with each other, Nick. You guys had a really good run today, but it's over now. So why don't you let the hostages go, and we'll sort this thing out? Not until my dad gets a new kidney. Make it two. What did he say? You get my message? Yeah, triple digits. Nice. Yeah, you? 212. Really? With all this going on? Hmm, it's all about the multitasking, my friend. Impressive. Thank you. Are gonna go to the hospital, see if we can't talk to the dad. Nobody gets in till we get back, okay? Yeah, okay, I can't promise. If homeboy gets jumpy, things might get tactical. Eddie, no one gets in. All right, you ready for this? 'Cause I'm a chess ninja. I'm a chinja. Hey, buddy. How come you don't call a guy back? We talked about this, Frank. You were supposed to leave town. Now, why would I leave? I like it here. It's Manhattan... the big apple. Nobody calls it that, Frank. Oh, look at you. Mr. New York local, Mr. Woody Allen! What do you want from me, Frank? I did what you wanted. I planted Kowalski's badge and gun. What I wanted? I was helping you, Navan. Hey, don't call me that. Whoa, whoa. Navan Granger! Stop it! Stop! Do you know what your problem is, is you don't know who your friends are. You called me, remember? "Kowalski knows." That sound familiar, huh? "He knows about my past." And what did I do? I made the problem go away, because that's what I do. I'm a problem solver. I never told you to kill a cop, Frank. I didn't kill a cop. I paid some chinese guy to do it. I should arrest you. Oh, do it. Then we can share a cell together at Leavenworth. We could call Detective Walsh to visit. Hey, I told you, he's not a problem. I took care of him. Oh, you took care of him? Yes. He was Kowalski's partner, right? I mean, that's what you said when you called. "I'm in trouble. Walsh knows." You got a home address for this guy? He's not gonna hurt us, Frank. Just leave it. I just want to look at the guy. I just want to size him up for myself. God is watching you, Frank Lutz. Don't you ever forget that. Oh, he's watching you, too, Navan. All right, old man. What's up sarge? Sit down. Are you on drugs? Uh... no, I don't think so. Why do you ask? Well, I'm seeing things. You don't really look people in the eye anymore. And you're a little too eager to jump in front of a bullet. What are you, my dad? Look, the job isn't just numbers, son. It's how you do it. It's why you do it. It's the people you do it with. Leo put you up to this? Did... did you ever have a partner get killed on you, Eric? No, sir. A guy who just a minute ago you were busting his balls and then there's blood, I mean, that really black arterial blood, and it's on your pants, and somewhere the guy's wife is putting pop tarts in a toaster for a 10-year-old. And now the clock is ticking... the countdown to that doorbell ringing, the men in the suits. Your partner is going through some really rough days right now. He's afraid. That makes him cautious. And around here, cautious gets you killed. So you got to ask yourself a question, Eric... you gonna help him out, or are you gonna be the guy ringing that doorbell? Banks isn't married, sir. Get out! Now, this connecting wall right here... you give the word, I can blow it, have a dozen guys in there between the guns and the hostages in five seconds. What do you think I should do? I think you should wait for Walsh. Sir, if we're gonna do this, we need to do this soon. Tell your guys to get ready. We are go alpha niner in 10 minutes. That's not a real code, sir. Just do it. You call Walsh, and you tell him whatever he's doing, he better do it fast. It's a real mess, Mike. You got to help us out. Nick's got a temper. He gets an idea in his head, you can't stop him. They're doing this for you, you know. And three people are dead. So it's got to stop now. You think I want this? I'm a young guy. Kidney failure? I don't deserve that. They're good kids. They understand that family comes first. Do you? What's that supposed to mean? Your son James. He's a good kid. He could have done a lot of things... been a doctor, teacher. But now he'll probably spend 20 years in a federal penitentiary. I told him not to go. Leave the wet work to his brothers. But he's a Boorland. So, you're telling me that you're okay with James spending most of his life in prison? Prison's part of life. Not his. He's not like you. Look, we don't have time for this. Hey, Mike, listen to me. If you get nick to surrender right now and you confess that you orchestrated this entire crime spree, I'll talk to the D.A., make sure James just gets probation. Now, he's a minor. They'll expunge his record as soon as he turns 21. He can still go to college. What about Nick? Nick? Come on. Nick's done. Armed robbery, murder. He's going away for the rest of his life. But you can still save James. And you want to know what else? If you confess to conspiracy to a bank robbery, they're gonna send you to a federal prison, where they'll take care of your kidney transplant courtesy of the federal government. Die on your feet, Mike. But you got to make that call. Report. Strike team in place. Ready to go. Where have you been? I've been calling you. I went to see a C.I. on staten island. I had no cell reception. What's going on? We got four Boorlands inside, six hostages. Alvarez is sending in E.S.U. Okay, tactical, you are cleared to... Wait, hold on. Something's happening. They're coming out. No weapons! Hold your fire! Nobody move. Nobody move. All right, I'm gonna call the D.A., start the paperwork on James' deal. Hold on. Hold on. I, uh... I have to confess something. Sergeant Brown asked me to look into you. He said Kowalski is a crooked cop and I.A.B. thinks that you are. You don't have to tell me anything. You don't have to say anything. I just, you know... I wanted you to know. When I was 22... uh, I was playing minor-league ball. And I threw a few games. For money? Yeah. Then I got called up to the majors, and all that stopped. Mm-Hmm. The guy I did it for didn't let it go so easy. Meaning? Some guys threatened me at first, and then my... my girlfriend was, uh... the cops said it was a... a mugging that went bad. And... that's... that's how I went from playing a game to being a cop. Walsh... So, you're right, Casey. You are right. We're partners now. And we need to trust each other. Just remember that next time you talk to Sergeant Brown. All right. 2nd squad, this is dispatch. Do you ever feel like you're the only person on earth, just yelling into the void? Hello? What's it gonna take to get some moo shu? Don't. Come on, man. I got to get this done. I did it all. What? The paperwork. I did it. Two car bombs. I thought you weren't gonna do paperwork anymore. Here's the thing. I love you. Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, what are we talking about here? No, no, I'm serious. I mean, we've been partners for eight years. Right? I mean, when... when I met you, you were still married to that miserable bitch, what's her name, right? Yeah, she was awful, huh? Mm-Hmm. She was like part terminator or something. I mean, were her female parts, like, made of scissors or fists or something? Move on. All right. Okay, so, the deal is, uh, I love you. And I don't want you to get hurt. And I'm not trying to jam you up. And jumping off that roof today, I realized, you know, I was being selfish. But you saved an old lady. I screw that old lady, all right? I almost got you killed, man. I mean, we're partners, you know? I'd push an old lady off a roof for you. Really? Yeah. Yeah, I'd push an old lady off a roof for you, too. You mean that? I... I do. Yeah. Whatever, you know, I'm going through personally, whatever, I'm just gonna keep you out of it. All right, deal? Thank you. Okay. Although, you know, I mean, if you need something, if I can help... No, no, no, no. Let's just drink. I love you, man. Okay, don't be gay. You're right. It's still a cop bar. 331. 608. You thought about having sex with me 608 times today? What happened? Earlier you were only at 119. I like to finish strong. Yeah? Show me.
