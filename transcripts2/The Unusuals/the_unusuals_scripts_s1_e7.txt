 to drive on the sidewalk. Hey, Jason, I got two tickets for the Rangers game tomorrow. You want to go? Uh... they re playing the islanders. So I thought we'd get a bite to eat first... a little barbecue, a couple of brewskies. Uh, tomorrow? Yeah, I checked the chart. We're both off at 4:00. So, uh, dress warm. It's gonna be awesome. Is Alvarez your best friend now?

 Oh, hey. Uh, you, uh... don't talk to me. Ouch. Is everything okay? Fine. Hey, Beaumont. Yeah. Taste this. It's an apple. It doesn't taste funny? Funny how? I don't know. Like, uh, salami? Hey, Banks, Delahoy. Never mind patrol just brought in this guy... tried to rob an armored car. Hey, sarge, this guy's... Yeah, I know. Welcome to Tuesday. So, it looks like you've had, uh, quite a morning, Mr. Speigleman. Taking on an armored car single-handed, no weapons... that's very ambitious for a man of your, uh, v... vintage. I'm on a new vitamin regimen. Can I get you something? Water? No, I'm fine. Okay. So, the arresting officer says that, uh... you tried to wrestle the money bag out of the security guard's hand and then you got tired and had to sit on the curb. He was stronger than he looked. It was exciting while it lasted, though. Ho ho! Listen, man, you're 87 years old, and this is your first offense. What happened... You blow your retirement on strippers and blood thinners? You ever live in a nursing home, son? Everyone just sitting around, waiting to die. Well, not me. I was an accountant for 30 years, married for 50. I'm done playing it safe. I'm gonna live before I die. You think a nursing home's boring? Wait till you try prison, man. Mr. Know-It-All, wait till you're 65. You can't pee. Forget about taking a decent crap or having an erection that doesn't start with a pill. Trust me... It's better to die young. Okay. Hey, can I, uh, talk to you for one second? Just hang on. Yeah, we can't put this guy in jail. Why not? He's a criminal. He's 87 years old. He's not gonna last 10 seconds in there. I know. That's his problem. You know what? I'm gonna talk to Sergeant Brown. Okay? I... You think I could get a seltzer? What's up, sarge? VIPs? coming to town. I need you to watch him. Watch him? Yeah, make sure nothing happens to him. He's been getting these threats lately. Oh, you mean like a protection detail? What's the matter with her? She's new. I'll talk with her. Guy's name is Gary Reed. He's some kind of business tycoon from Albany. He's been getting these cryptic postcards from the city... "Watch yourself," Things like that. Wait... if this guy's so rich, then why doesn't he just hire a bodyguard? You want to explain it to her? Look, Casey, remember I told you... NYPD the economy of favors, that whole thing? All right, well, this is the scale of importance. It's not complicated. It's very simple, actually. The basic principle is this... crap rolls downhill. Yeah, in other words, why should the guy spend his own money when he can make a phone call? He calls the governor, the governor calls the mayor, the mayor calls the police commissioner, et cetera. It's a phone tree. It ends with you. The governor does realize there's a thing called crime, right? Wow. You're thinking too hard. This is a sweet detail. I mean, the guy's in town for one night. He's probably a shut-in, so you spend a few hours in a posh hotel, order some room service. It's not gonna kill you. All right. We're on it, sarge. Thank you. Come on. Hey, sarge. The old guy... he's confused. I just called the nursing home, and they said he's got bouts of dementia. I don't think here's a case. Okay. Kick him loose. Thanks again for doing this. I know it's silly, but ever since those postcards came, my wife insists I take extra precautions. Yeah, well, anything we can do to help. Just wait here. We're also gonna need a copy of your itinerary for the advance team. Sure. Oh, I have some business meetings in the morning... banking. I started a company 10 years ago. We created a software program that makes it easier for banks to talk to each other. It's actually... it's pretty embarrassing how rich I've become. I give it away as fast as I can, but we keep making more money. I know how you feel. Right. I... I'm a jerk. I know. I used to hate guys like me. But look at this... I still wear the same watch that my dad gave me when I was 8. Hmm? All right. We're all clear. Well, anyway, I'm just gonna order some room service, watch a movie, go to bed. All right. Well, uh, if you need us, we'll be outside. Don't worry. The New York Police Department is here to protect you. Dude, you owe me 5 bucks. Why? 10 bucks, actually. You said "protect." Not to mention what you said over at the precinct. So? Clearly, you've never worked detail before, but you cannot say "protect" or "protection." It's bad luck. You're making this up. No, no. These rules are passed down through the ages, okay? There is a huge jinx factor in this work, like an airline pilot or cleanup hitter. Wow. I never pinned you for the superstitious type. Ah. Yeah, well, good luck is invisible. Bad luck is an iceberg in the middle of the night. All right, you take first watch. What? Why? 'Cause you're the rookie. Anyway, can you sleep in a chair? No. Then there you have it. You got anger issues, lady. Hey, you don't want to get bit, Don't put your hand in my mouth. Allison, I'm serious. I'm sure Jason didn't mean anything by it. You know, in my experience, Men always mean what they say. Well, at least give him a chance to explain. What is this, a soap opera? Look, I told you... I didn't do nothing. You know what? You were stopped with expired plates. Uniforms found crowbars, coveralls, and ski masks in the trunk, not to mention two shotguns. You feel like telling us where you were going? That's what I thought. So, you gonna tell me what happened earlier... that thing with Beaumont? I doubt it. Come on. You guys were in a fight or something? Tell me. I'm bored. I yelled at her. Why? I don't know. It was in her dream. What? Look, I... I wake up this morning and Beaumont's just sitting there at the end of my bed, staring at me, which is creepy. So I ask Beaumont, "what's wrong?" She says that I yelled at her in her dream. Huh. Apparently, she thinks this is something that I should apologize for. And I told her, like, it didn't really happen. It was a dream. The whole thing's ridiculous. Wait, wait. You didn't say that, did you? Well, yeah. And she asked if I was calling her ridiculous, and then the whole thing just kind of... went downhill from there. Yeah, I don't know. Is that a sex scream? I don't know what kind of sex you're having. I think it's coming from the stairwell. I'm gonna go check it out. No, no, Casey, don't. Don't. We got to stay with the principal, okay? I'll call it in. We have to stay with the... Police! Freeze! Aah! Aah! Freeze! You okay? He was gonna kill me! Walsh! I put guards on all the exits. If this guy's still in the hotel, we'll find him. All right. Thank you. Walsh! Oh, no. Oh, no. He's gone. There's blood. You lost him? Captain, we checked the security-camera tapes. Whoever grabbed Reed knew the hotel, because there's no sign of them leaving. And the woman? Broken ribs. She's also got a concussion. We looked into her background, but it's clean. And we ran the blood in Reed's room, and it is his. Detective, if you were anybody else, I'd bust you back down to uniform, but your father's one of the richest men in the city and a personal friend of the mayor's, so I can't touch you. I already knew. Sir... I'd like to be treated as other cop no special favors... The favor's not for you, detective. It's for your father. So you get a pass whether you want one or not. But I'm taking both of you off of this case. Wait, wait, wait. Okay, then I do want a favor. I changed my mind. I... I'd like you to keep us on the case. We'll get him back. You got 24 hours. Oh, Walsh, hey. I walked by your desk before, and you weren't there, but you're here now. What do you need, Eddie? Oh, no, no, I just... I don't know if you forget about the game tonight and how cold it's gonna be by the ice, so I brought you a hat. My wife knitted it. Yeah, you know, Eddie, I don't think I'm gonna be able to go tonight. Oh. Yeah, you know, this whole V.I.P. thing blew up on us. Yeah, no, no. No, it's cool. You don't have to e... explain. It's no big deal. I'll just ask Delahoy or... something, so... W... well, next time, though, huh? He's really got a man crush on you, huh? Yeah. I'm getting an E.T.A. On the sketch artist from the woman's attacker. I'm on the phone with CSU... see if we can find anything in Reed's room. Oh, hey, here you go. Hey, get your stuff. We got to go. What's the matter now? Is there meat in yogurt? Meat yogurt? Yeah, that's sweeping the nation. Come on, grab your coat. Let's go. Why? The old man from yesterday... dispatch says he just jacked a pizza-delivery car. So we'll just have patrol deal with it. He's old, Eric... confused. He needs our help. Leo, he needs to be arrested and go to jail. Okay, all right, all right. I'll meet you downstairs. Just give me two minutes. I got to make a call. Hello? Yeah, hey, Dr. Crumb, uh, it's, uh, Eric Delahoy calling. I don't have the test results back yet. Oh, no, that's okay. I was actually... I'm calling because I have another symptom. Everything I eat tastes like meat. Which sounds much dirtier than I intended. Definitely neurological. If you were dead, you know what I'd do? An autopsy. 'Cause I'm a medical examiner, not your doctor. Oh, okay. Okay. You don't have to get snippy, okay? I just... I just thought you'd want to know, seeing as how you're in the middle of an examination. Yes, because you're blackmailing me. Blackmail's kind of an ugly word, don't you think? I'm hanging up now. Just hold on. Hold on one second. I got to go arrest this 90-year-old carjacker, but, uh, can you, uh, can you meet me for lunch? Lunch? Yeah. I mean, you know, just to... talk about my head. 4:00 at the Apolo. Okay. All right. Thank you. Eric, I, uh... got these two tickets to the Rangers game tonight. I thought maybe you'd... Thanks, man. That's... that's nice. Gary got one a week for the last three months. He said it was just a crank, but I knew. Mrs. Reed, we're gonna do everything we possibly can to get your husband back safely. Uh, we put a trap-and-trace on your phone in case there are any ransom calls. Does your husband have any enemies? Gary? No. He's harmless. Everybody likes him. You were supposed to watch him. How could this happen? We're gonna find him, Mrs. Reed. We'll get him. Man, I really screwed up this time. Just let it go. Just focus on catching these guys, all right? Hey, how's it going? Nice try. I'm still not talking to you. It was a dream! Allison, I'm sure he's sorry about what he said. Oh, so now you're taking his side? No, I don't take sides. Oh, right. I forgot. You don't judge. It's not Christian. Make yourself comfortable. If I've done something to offend you, just let me know. No. It's not you. I'm... just having a really bad day. Well... I think I know what can cheer you up. You want to do "tape delay" or "the gypsy" on this guy? Really? Mm-Hmm. Tape delay, definitely. Well, what about your rule? Oh, I can break it... Just this once. You're the best partner ever. Mm-Hmm. Hey, you're mucking up The works, you chicken head! How does this guy not know his blinker is on? I don't know. Maybe his hearing aid's off. Hey, this is the police! Pull your car over... Now. Is he... speeding up? I think he's trying to make a run for it. Hey. Steve McQueen. Pull your car over... Now! We have hard candies. Butterscotch. Oh, there's cops. They're right there. Get out of the car. Yeah, yeah. Okay. I've never been in a high-speed chase before. It was exhilarating. You like that? Yeah? Well, say hello to Mr. Handcuff. Okay, well, turn around. We're gonna do it this way, all right? Now, give me your left hand. All right. He escaped? Yes, ma'am. But we sent out the sketch That you gave us. Ms. Holmes, are you sure you never saw the man who attacked you before? Never. I work as a masseuse at the hotel spa, and I had just finished a massage on 8, and I had another one three flights down. I always take the stairs. Mm-hmm. When you were attacked, my partner and I were on the 8th floor. We were watching a man named, uh, Gary Reed. Do you recognize him? No. Why? We think the man that attacked you was creating a diversion, 'cause we went back to Mr. Reed's room, and there was blood, signs of a struggle. Mr. Reed was gone. That's awful. Yeah. All right, thank you for your help. This is Detective Hanover. He's gonna show you some photographs. If you recognize any of them, let us know, okay? Thank you. Thanks. Thank you. Be honest. The crowbars, the masks, the shotguns... You were on your way to a robbery. Look, I told you... that's not my stuff. Are you deaf? Everything okay? I, uh... we ran a check on the shotguns. They were stolen from a gun store upstate last week. Look, I... I don't even know where that is. You sure you're okay, Mr. Neel? Cause you seem pretty jumpy. I... I... I'm fine. I, uh... No. You don't look fine. You know, sometimes a guilty conscience manifests itself in strange ways. That's true. I've seen grown men weep and pull out their eyebrows. Look, I'm not guilty! I... I... I haven't done anything! I'll make you a deal, Mr. Neel. If you tell us exactly what you were planning, I'll talk to the D.A., see if we can cut you a break. Otherwise... okay. You're right. T... that was my bag, my guns. I... I was going to... Oops. Sorry. Get out. Have you guys seen Walsh? Cause we were supposed to... Get... out. Uh... okay. Sorry. You know what? I want a lawyer. Hey, Case, you find anything? No, nothing. Reed is a pretty boring guy. Graduated from an Ivy league school, married his high-school sweetheart, started a business out of his garage, now he's worth $20 million. Right. Ransom call came in about 15 minutes ago. The T.A. response unit recorded it. Hello? Honey, it's... it's me. Oh, Gary. Thank god. I'm okay. Um, they beat me up pretty good. I think my hand is broken. Gary... they want $10 million in unmarked bills... today. They said they would e-mail you with the details. Please, do what they say. I don't... I don't want to die. I love y... I tell you... I haven't felt this alive in years. I need a nap. Yeah, just take it easy, old-timer. You need your inhaler? No. Have a seat... Right over there. Need a pillow? I'll take a pillow. Shut up. Listen. We gonna be right over there, okay? Let us know if you need to tinkle or... all right, so, Now we process him, right? Again. You want to send an 87-year-old man to the tombs? Come on! I'm confused. Then why... why'd we, uh, arrest him? Because... it's my fault. All right? I kicked him loose too quickly the last time. He probably just needs a good scare, a couple of hours in a jail cell. It'll make the nursing home look good. Leo, the man is on a geriatric crime spree, okay? He doesn't want to go back to the nursing home. He wants to die in action. No. You heard him. He feels abandoned. He's just looking for some attention. What? Leo, he broke the law, okay? He wants to be punished, all right? And the joint's probably the safest place for the guy. Look, he's not gonna spend the rest of his life in a cell. Why not? Honestly, why do you care so much? Our victim's name is Gary Reed... This gentleman right here. He's been missing for 14 hours. He is hurt, but as of an hour ago, he's still alive. Now, whoever kidnapped Reed knows the drill. The e-mail sent to his wife was untraceable. At 2:00 p.m., we're gonna do the drop. The ransom will be in a happy baby backpack. It looks like this. The wife will drop it in a garbage can at the corner of 11th and avenue "A." Okay, people, we've run these scenarios. You all know what to do. We surround the drop site, we monitor the entire exchange. Walsh and Casey will follow the money. Alvarez, you're in charge of the ghost unit. 10-4, good buddy. All right, so, we'll have two lookout units... one here... and here is one. And here we're also gonna have some ground units dressed up as construction workers in this area. There you go. What are we waiting for? Let's go! All units, be advised... Reed's wife is on the way. Look alive, people. It's show time. Tactical out. I can't believe you knew I was rich this whole time. Your last name's Shraeger. There are buildings named after you. True. This doesn't change the way you think about me, does it? I don't think about you. That's fair enough. Look, don't worry about the rest of the squad. You're good police. That's all that matters. But you should tell them anyway... get it over with. You should apologize to Beaumont. For what? I didn't do anything. Walsh, how long have you been dating women and you haven't figured this out? It doesn't matter who's right. It matters that you listen. All right. All right. Here we go. Got the wife. She's making the drop. Bus. We lost her. We lost visual on the backpack. Who's got eyes? Trash can's empty. It's empty. There's no backpack. Grab the kids! Let's search every backpack! Nobody move! Every backpack! Oh, there's so many. Over there! Over there! All these kids have the same backpack! No one leave. Casey. There! There! NYPD! Throw out the backpack! Show me your hands! Do it now! Don't shoot. All right, we're not gonna hurt you. What are you doing? Why were you running? Some guy gave me 100 bucks to put on the backpack and run away. It's empty. So, what'd he look like? Tall... maybe. I don't know. I never seen 100 bucks before. Oh. I'm supposed to give you this. "You were warned... no cops. Now he dies." The body was dumped outside the Peyton hotel 20 minutes after the ransom drop. If I had to give cause of death right now, I'd say fire... probably burned alive. How long till you confirm I.D.? I'm running his dentals. Should know more in a few hours. Walsh. Yeah? We'll be right back. Come on. Hey, uh, where'd you go on your last vacation? What? You go someplace warm? Reed is dead, and you're talking about vacations? No. What I'm trying to do is calm you down. We were supposed to protect him. 5 bucks. It's not funny! We were supposed to protect him, and now he's dead! Casey, look, you made a choice, okay? That's what this job is. It didn't work out so good this time. But I guarantee you there's gonna be a lot more decisions to make tomorrow. And if you can't do that, you might as well just quit. I don't quit ever. Good. Okay. All right, we need to dig deeper. There's got to be something with Reed... Something with his company, banking. My father has a friend that works at the world bank. I'll call him. Perfect. Hi. Uh, thanks for, uh, thanks for meeting me. You mean I had a choice? Look, it doesn't have to be this way, okay? We can enjoy a meal. You know, two colleagues sharing a professional dialogue. I have to be back by 5:00. Well, the black bowel is pretty good. Okay. That's what I'm talking about. Taste these. Okay. Tastes normal to me. Not like ham? Interesting. Could be the tumor. If it is a tumor, it's pressing on the taste center in your brain. Or maybe you've had a stroke. Your people skills are really terrible. I mean, you know that, right? You've no idea. Every time I look at people, all I can see is what's gonna kill them... smoking, obesity, accident-prone. People find out what I do, they make an excuse to be somewhere else. But enough about you. My tumor. How long, um... I mean, it's gonna kill me, right? I haven't seen your emergency-room x-rays, and your blood work alone is inconclusive, which is why you need to see a real doctor... immediately. Because right now, it's your sense of taste. Tomorrow morning, you could wake up blind or paralyzed. You could forget how to swallow or breathe. This is really turning out to be a... A hell of a lunch date. Did you say "date"? Mm, I have to go. No, no. Are you kidding? Okay, pops. On your feet. Scared straight yet? Nope. Still having a great time. Stand over there. Let's go. Sit down. Armed robbery... court street jewelers. One dead. Assault with a deadly weapon... 16 Mott Street. You can stop. I get it. No, you don't get it. See, you think crime is fun... a thrill. Well, it's not. It's terrifying. For the victims, criminals, and for the cops. I notice you never take off the vest and use that antibacterial stuff all the time. You know who you remind me of? Me. 30 years playing it safe, driving the speed limit. My wife wanted to travel, but all I could think of was, "what if the plane crashes? What if we get diarrhea?" So we never went anywhere, never did anything. Look, you don't know me. You don't know my reasons. We all have reasons, son. The bottom line is, there's only one way to live, and that's all the way. If you die, you die. Cause I promise you... When you're my age, you'll ask yourself, "what the hell did I play it safe for?" Hey, look... look. You got a problem with your life, the way you lived it, that's your business, but you break the law, that's my business. You want to take a risk? Do it to help someone. Try to make the world a better place before you go. Don't... You know what? That's it. I've had it. Let's go. I'm done with you. Get up. Let's go. Guess what. What? Just got off the phone with my dad's homey from the world bank. Turns out the FBI is launching an investigation into Gary Reed's company. What for? Embezzlement. I mean the case isn't official yet, but they think the software he designed to help the banks run their business has been stealing one penny from every transaction. One penny. 60 million transactions a day. Oh. Well, that, my rich friend, is what we call a lead. Shraeger. Detective, it's Dr. Crumb. I checked Reed's dentals against the body's. This is not Gary Reed. What? Who is it? Gabe Chuley... ex-con. I e-mailed you his rap sheet. Come here. Uh, okay. I'm opening it. Hold on. Turns out he was strangled, then burned. Wow. Thanks. Gary Reed is not Gary Reed. Two leads. That's the guy from the hotel, right? Police! Freeze! Aah! Yeah, the one who attacked the masseuse. Hmm. I mean, so, the killer must have known that we're gonna check Reed's dentals, right? Yeah, so it wasn't about getting away with it. It was about... buying more time. Right. And the only reason you buy more time is to create more distance between the cops and the kidnapper. For what? To take Reed with them? No. I got it. Fake body, FBI investigation. Walsh, there was no kidnapping. Gary Reed staged the whole thing. Shraeger? Yo. All right. So I just got back from the hotel with Reed's picture. Looks like our kidnap victim stayed there ten times over the last 2 months... Always under a different name, always for the same masseuse. Sally Holmes. Yeah. So to the hospital. Sally Holmes check herself out over an hour ago. Ked herself went to her apartment, And... yeah, surprise... It's empty. All right, married man is having an affair with his masseuse, finds out he's about to be indicted for stealing millions of dollars, so he fakes his own kidnapping. And uses his mistress to set us up. Yeah, but you know what? Here's the thing... he's rich, right? Why doesn't he just use his own money, go to Argentina? As soon as he made a withdrawal, the FBI would have been all over him. He needed the cash. Right. I got Reed's picture at every airport, bus station, train station, but it's probably no use, because if Reed wanted out of the city, he's probably already gone. Well, I subpoenaed his financial records. Maybe if we can trace his money, we can figure out where he is. Yeah? You can actually read these things? My father taught me how to read spreadsheets when I was 6 years old. He wanted me to go into the family business. I was a real disappointment. Hmm. If it makes you feel any better, my mom dressed me like a girl till I was 6. That does make me feel better. Hmm. I thought it would. All right, well, I'm gonna call the feds, get this party started. Hey, where you been? Oh, out... on errands. Where's the sunshine boy? I cut him loose. Yeah? Yeah, it's Leo. This is Tom. You were right. I was being selfish. Good. Good. I'm glad I finally got through to you. I know what I need to do now... Something constructive, like you said. It's going to be dangerous, but... Wait... wait a second. What are you talking about? I think I can pull it off. Wish me luck. What? Wait. What was that about? Leo? I think our old guy is about to do something really stupid. What'd you tell him? Hey! Hey, that's my perp! What'd you say?! He said something to my old guy, got him all charged up. Hey! Take it easy, Leo. What's he gonna do? I... I don't know what you're talking about. Really? Hey, hey! What the hell's going on? Beaumont's young perp got our old perp all juiced up, and now he's out there looking to commit some crime. Do what you got to do. What? No. No, h... hold on. You see how that works? You see how that works, huh? What'd you tell my guy? You told him about your job, didn't you? The crowbars, The ski masks! Vikram, you don't want that man's death on your conscience. Hey. Come on. Have a heart. He's an old man. He's in over his head. You'll get him killed. All we talked about was taxes. You know what? I'm gonna dangle him out the window a little while. Yeah, I'll help. No! I... Hey, wait, wait, wait. Tell me what you told him. I'll get you a deal. Whoa. You can't offer that. No jail time. That's our case. Done. Start talking. The old guy was complaining about all the pills he's got to take... You know, how expensive they are. I told him about this pharmacy warehouse... Enough drugs for his entire nursing home to party for a year. Hell, if I can't rob it, somebody should, right? I told him to do something constructive. Does the warehouse have a guard? Yeah, but, uh... yeah, but what? You took him away before I had the chance to tell him that. Security guard's not answering the phone, man. No! Police! Holster your weapon! Hang in there, buddy. Help is on the way. Dispatch, this is 380. I need an ambulance to 141 River Street. I caught him stealing some pills. I... I didn't know he was an old dude. Yeah, the, uh, cardigan didn't give it away? He reached for something. I thought it was a gun. It was his inhaler. Hey. Got it. What? Three weeks ago, Reed's company bought a controlling interest in an international shipping company. Alcon. Alcon, yeah. They have some boats down in the Brooklyn Navy yard. So? So maybe he gets on a boat and flees the country. Yeah, but customs checks all passenger compartments and crew manifests before a ship can leave the harbor. Well, maybe he's not a passenger or a crew member... Maybe a stowaway. Hiding where? In one of the 300 containers. If they don't search those things when they come in to the country, they're definitely not searching them when they go out. Homeland security. The bullet went straight through. You're gonna be okay. I blew it. Look, just... just relax, okay? I had my chance to do something important. Now... what's anyone gonna remember me for? They're gonna remember you for being a devoted husband. No one cares about those things. What, are you kidding me? I would give anything to have your life. Well, you had stability, security, love. You worked one job for 30 years, married for 50. 50? Come on. I mean, what do I got? I got a one-bedroom apartment with... rubber floors. Excitement? Try terror. You built something important brick by brick. You kept it safe, whole. The people you loved... knew they were loved. What are they gonna remember you for? Everything. Please... W... what is it? W... what can I do for you? You're... you're... standing... on my oxygen line. What? Oh, oh! Oh, sorry. I'm sorry... sorry. You Walsh? Yeah. This is Detective Shraeger. Hi. So, which one's our boat? That one. They're scheduled to launch in an hour, but one of the cranes broke down. We need every container searched. Only 15 left to load. All the rest are already onboard. Okay. All right, everybody, listen up. Pair up, spread out. Let's crack 'em open. Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Walsh. Yeah? Come here. Listen. You hear that? It sounds like someone's laughing. In here. Howdy. Whoa. NYPD. Wow. Nice digs. Put your hands up. W... wait, wait, wait, wait. A... a million bucks if you walk out of here and you pretend that you never saw me. You just picked the wrong cop to bribe, my friend. Get up. Get up... now! Get up. Stand up. Let's go. A-All right. Let's go. Apolo So, the old guy's okay? Yeah, yeah. And the warehouse felt so bad for shooting him, they're, uh, making a donation to his nursing home. Nothing says "sorry I shot you" like a lifetime supply of heparin. From the gentleman over there. Excuse me, gentlemen. Um, you got me a... a girly drink? Yeah, for a sexy, smart, beautiful, totally awesome girl. Is this your way of apologizing? Well... yeah, I'm a guy. I... I say stupid things sometimes. Look, I... when I'm on the job, I have to be tough, I got to be uncle Beaumont. But when I'm with you, I need to be... vulnerable and feminine. Me. Yeah. You know, and I'm glad that I'm the only one who gets to see you that way. Me too. So, you want to see me that way right now? Yes, I do. Okay. Let's get out of here. Come on. Oh, wait. Hang on a sec. Are you ditching me for Alvarez? Just five minutes, okay? Get a girly drink. Hey, hey. Hey. So, uh, I thought you were going to the game. Oh, yeah, no. Delahoy... took the tickets. Well, uh, Listen, Eddie, I got a friend over with the Yankees, and he said he can get me a peek at the new stadium. I was gonna go on Sunday, if you want to go. Really? Yeah. You'd like that? Hey, have you ever stood on the grass in a major league stadium... Yankee stadium? The stands, the lights, the whole thing... I mean, it's, uh, it's pretty amazing. Yeah. Yeah, that would be great. Good. I'll bring my new hat. Okay. Hi. I have an announcement to make, please. Oh, hang on. Uh, can I have everyone's attention, please? I have an announcement. My name is Casey Shraeger. I am the daughter of Estelle and Walter Shraeger, the 25th-richest family in all of New York City. I am also a cop. I... I just thought you'd like to know. Good girl. Thanks. I'm proud of you. Yeah. I did it. Yes. You okay? Yeah, I'm good. I need a drink. Yeah, can we get a whiskey over here? Hi. Hey, rich girl. My butler retired last week. I'm just wondering, you know, you got any pointers on hiring? Yeah, I'll look into that for you. Hey, you know, in my apartment, I... I need a... a new safe room, and Delahoy told me to tell you he wants a trans-Am. Big engine. Trans-Am. Great. How about a round for everybody... on her? I'd like that. Cheers.
