 _ _ _ _ Come on, girls, come on. Oh, my God, I am being triggered right now. This house is a lot like the one I grew up in. My mother used to make me do the screwdriver test every week. - The what? - Screwdriver test. If you can't push a six-inch screwdriver into the lawn,

 you are not watering it enough. So what are we looking at? A psychological assessment. And a spiritual one. Seeing if it can be dealt with with therapy. - Hi. - Hi. - Are your parents home? - Are you here for my brother? - We are. - Mom, Dad! Hi. Thank you so much for coming. Um, I'm Tom McCrystal. This is Olive. - Hey, Olive. - Uh, come on in, please. Can I get you anything? Water? Coffee? Fruit snacks? We're fairly well-stocked.

 Huh. What kind of fruit snacks? We're fine, thank you. But we'd love to meet Eric if that's all right. This way. Okay. Oh, uh, so, sometimes we need to sleep in the same room so that we can lock the door. - I see. - Yeah. Eric? Eric. Yes? It's time for the appointment we talked about yesterday. Um, we'll stay out here. He gets a little agitated when he sees the baby. So you're here to evaluate me? Well, we're here to talk. I'm David Acosta. I'm Kristen Bouchard. Hi. Hi, I'm Ben. I don't have chairs, but we can sit on the floor. Do you know why your parents called us here, Eric? Yeah. Can you tell us what happened with your big sister? I bit her. Really hard. She was bleeding a lot. And she cried. And why did you bite your sister? Because I wanted to. Did something happen that made you want to? Can you tell us? We were watching Steven Universe and she kept laughing and I wanted her to stop. It was too loud. I told her to stop, but she didn't. But you don't laugh when you hurt. So you knew you were hurting her when you bit her? And how did you feel when you were doing that to your sister? Did you... like hurting her? Eric, look at me. Did you like hurting her? Mm-hmm. And what is it you liked about hurting her? I don't know. It's kind of like watching a story I made on my own. Like, at school, there's this kid in my class that I'm always stuck next to. Because my last name's McCrystal, and his last name's McCray. So, on our last field trip to Grand Central, we played dare or dare. And I made him jump onto the train tracks and count to 42 before he could get up. But then one of our teachers grabbed him before the train came. Did you want him to get hit by the train? Even though that could have hurt him really badly, or even kill him? I guess. You got good taste in comics. You ever read any of the Ochre 7 collection? - No. - It's a story about immortal kids who play hide-and-seek through time. I'm surprised you haven't read any of it. In volume four, Simona dares Patrick to jump onto the railroad tracks and count to 42 before he can get off. Maybe I did read that one and forgot. Eric was... was loving and caring. He was totally different. And then... When did he change? Two years ago. It snuck up on us. A-a tantrum here, a fib there. - Are you a mother? - Yes. You know how you just write it off as kid stuff. Then it accumulates, and now it's a struggle to remember who he was. What about the, uh, locks on the cupboards and the fridge? He tried to poison us. - Why? - He said he was doing an experiment, and he wanted to see how long it would take us to feel the liquid bleach in the milk. Luckily we had a nanny cam that saw what he did. Have you had him psychologically evaluated? 12 times. But the psychologists don't agree. Any medications? Uh, antidepressants, ADHD, O.D.D. - 23 separate protocols. - Yeah, and some have worked for a time, but then he outgrows them. He's been institutionalized twice. And the police were sent to his school three times. These are the police reports. I hate to suggest this, - but there are federal programs. - _ Yes, and they took Eric for a week before they asked us to come pick him up. They're supposed to take everybody, but they won't take Eric. I mean, we've been at this for two years. And we're just... God, I didn't want to do this. We just need someone to help us. We're not very good Catholics. But Eric has something inside him. A demon. I never thought that I would say that. But I believe it now. Something changed Eric two years ago, and it wants to kill us. And that is why we need your help. This is a nightmare. We have to get our own psych eval before I can request any Church action. Yeah, I'll get on it. Guys, there's a chance this is environmental. Okay? The oldest daughter, she had a greenish tint in her hair. That's from acidity. There's oxidized metal particles in the water. That is like copper piping. Okay? And they moved here two years ago. That's when the kid started to act differently. It's possible. Overexposure to copper can cause psychiatric symptoms. You look into it, and we'll get our own psych eval with Eric. - Great. - Ben. Could you check my house for metal corrosion? Yeah, your kids psychos? Mom, we're home. - Mom, I'm so hungry. - Mom! My stomach is literally killing me. - Mom, we're home! - Mom, where are you?! - Where's Mom? - Hey, quiet. No, no, no. Hey, hey, hey. Quiet, quiet. What is this? Good, I have your attention. All right, now listen very carefully. Your mother's still at work, and I've got a pair of eights. See? - Mm-hmm. - There are Pop-Tarts in the kitchen. And since I can't remember any of your birthdays, these. - Oh, my gosh! - No, let go! My birthday's the closest! Good, good... no, no, no. Don't-don't thank me. Thank you so much, Grandma. Open it. Now, listen, if you can't keep quiet, I'm taking them away. I want to hold it. Oh, my gosh, I know what these are. Augmented reality goggles. There's a girl at school who has them. - Grandma, these are great. - I know. Now, everybody, kiss me on my cheek and then go play. Okay? But please don't kill anyone. - No killing. - Mwah! _ - Okay, we can try World Trip, - _ - Block the Blocks, - _ - Bunny Hopp... - The Haunted Girl. The Haunted Girl! The Haunted Girl! _ - Let us see. We want to see. - _ We just put them on, we're all sharing. - Stop it! - Why does sharing mean you guys get to go first? 'Cause we're the oldest. - Whoa, what do we do now? - _ - Grandma said it was all right - _ - to use them, so I think it's okay. - _ - Why, what does it say? - _ - Nothing, just if we're old enough. - _ - What's it say now? - _ - It's asking if we're pregnant. - _ - What? - Well, we're not, so... _ Whoa. Oh, my God. - What, what is it? - Let me have it. It's so weird. It's just our room, but there are spiderwebs and... and spiders! There are spiders. What? Where? - We want to see. - No, just wait, just wait, wait. Oh, my God. It's our turn, it's been five minutes! Come on! - Let us try. - Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait, no, no, no, no. _ - Wait, should we? - Yes. - What? - It wants us to turn out the lights. Oh, my God! - What is it? - A spider, - in the hall. - Giant. - Massive. - I think it's my turn. - It's our turn! - Wait, wait, wait. - Stop it, stop it, Laura. - Can I have it? - Stop it right now. - Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, - stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. - This is insane. It's so real, so real. So real. - Should we? - _ It's just our bathroom. Close it! - Oh, my gosh! Oh, ew! - He's coming, he's coming... - Close it quickly! - He's coming, he's coming... - Close it, close it! Close it! - He's coming, he's coming, - he's coming. - Close it! What? - It's our turn now. - Hold this. I'll help you. Okay. Just know that none of this is real. So is it a game, or what? What do I do? I don't know. We didn't get far enough. Just don't get scared. This isn't scary. I don't see anything. - Open the bathroom door. - _ Just know that it's not real. - Don't get scared. - Go on. It's fine, Laura, you can do it. Come on. What? It's just our bathroom. You don't see it? The guy with the butcher knife? - He was just there. - Yeah. - No. - He was right there a second ago. - No. There's nothing. - Seriously? - You guys were making it all up! - No, we weren't. - It was right there! - Yes, you were! - You think we'd lie about this stuff? - Look! There's nothing here! Yeah. I think these are broken. They don't work. They're not broken, just wait one second. - Just look around... - What are we supposed to see? Something scary. What? Did you hear something? What is it? Uh-huh. Do you see something? What is it? What is it? What do you see? - What do you see? - What is it? Lexis, you're okay! Lexis, you're okay! What is it? Lexis, Lexis, Lexis, Lexis, you're okay. What do you see? Laura, there's nothing, okay? There's nothing. It's all fake, okay? There's nothing there. Laura, there's nothing. Laura, where are you going? Laura, where are you going? Laura! What's going on? What are these? Where'd you get 'em? Honey, are you okay? I-I got 'em as a communal gift. - I thought they'd like 'em. - Switch to Bunny Hopp. They're-they're cool. You should try them on. - Yeah, look, Mom. Take a look. - They're super cool. Sweetheart, what's the matter? See, it's-it's like Pokémon Go. - You just hunt bunnies. - Yeah, they're fun. See? Then, why was your sister screaming? - She's a little baby. - Shut up! Because she doesn't like whacking bunnies - on the head. - Okay, here's the deal. You can play with these, but not on the stairs and only after you do your homework, okay? - Okay, we'll start our homework right now. - Come on, guys. - I'm not scared anymore. - Good. - All right, dinner. Let's go. - Good, honey. Let's go. Dinner. - Mom, what's for dinner? - Um, we are going to have... It's Grandma's special. ♪ Evil 1x04 ♪
