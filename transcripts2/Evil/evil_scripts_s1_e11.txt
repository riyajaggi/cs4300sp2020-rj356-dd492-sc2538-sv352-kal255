 He'll be out of surgery soon, and then we'll know more. - What is the doctor saying? - Uh, nothing at the moment, but I'll get you an update as soon as I can. Just please hold tight, Father. - What happened? - An attack of some kind. The police don't know yet. They thought maybe a mugging, but nothing's been taken. - Oh. - David put up a fight. He, uh... You two don't have to stay. - I can call you if anything changes. - No, no, no, no, no. - We got this. - Do you know who would have done this?

 I'm not sure. Oh, it's the parish. I don't think it's a mugging. No. Too many crazies threatening him. We should talk to the cop. - Oh, God. - What? It's Detective Leder. I know him from the court. He's an idiot. What are you doing? I need to ask a favor. Thanks. How's he doing? Well, sounds like the surgery was successful,

 but he's in a lot of pain. This is the priest from your house? Yeah, the priest in training. Ah. To protect and serve. Nurse Allen to Radiology. Hey, Detective, I got it from here. Good luck. Did he question you? Not yet. Just the paramedics. Did David have any enemies? - Yes. - Who? - Leland Townsend. - How do I know that name? He's a forensic psychologist, works with the D.A.? - And he's an enemy? - Yes. Okay. Anybody else? Um, well, David's work, or our work, brings us into the circle of many ill people. Ill as in... ? - Psychopathic. - Who's Ghana? - Ghana? - Ghana. - The country? - The report says the EMT heard David saying "Ghana" over and over as he was brought in. Ghana... that's an old case. - Who are you? - I'm Ben Shakir. - Ben works... - I work on David's team. And what was this case? Well, six months ago, um, there was a coder who tried to kill himself. His, uh, roommate thought he was possessed. - And "Ghana" was his first name, last name? - Last. - Richard Ghana. - You have an address? No, but could probably get one. - Description? - Tall, Caucasian, you know, looked like a bad gym teacher. Any reason that he'd want to attack Acosta? I don't know. Okay, I'm going to the scene. I'll be back. Thanks, Mira. So was this a possession case? I mean, I wasn't that involved in it, but David thought it was, and Judy didn't, so... Who's Judy? Oh, she... she was you. Before you. M-Me before me? Well, what does that mean? She was the psychologist on the team before you came along. I've been wrong about Marie being dead. It's all right, David. They want you not to move. Your stitches. Are you in pain? I can get the nurse. - Aah. - It's all right. Just blink your eyes once if you're in pain. Got it. You can push this button any time to call the nurse. I'm Father Douglas. I'm leaving my rosary, David. All we have to do is find out who impersonated... I'll check in on you every day. And if you need anything, just turn the crucifix face down, and I'll be there for you. Now, I've got to go check on an old friend. Harlan Zephyr. Glad to see you still hanging in there. Are you feeling better today? Uh, Father, my right toe really itches. Can you reach it? Oh, sure. Thanks, Father. That feels much better. Stay well, my son. I'll come back on Sunday. Okay. Bye, David. Get some rest. Help! God! God! God! God! God! God! No. No. No. No, no, no, no, no. No, no. I'm fine. I'm fine. See, I... I-I... I stopped. Don't call her. It's her shift. The one with the squeaky shoes. Squeak, squeak, squeak. We call her "Nurse Plague". You're the guy who was mugged, right? Yes. Watch out for her. Crazy bitch. The squeaky shoes. You can hear them down the hallway. I'm Harlan. David. We got to stick together, David. Most black patients die in hospitals from... accidents. Bleeding out internally, complications after surgery, infections. But it's not random. It's because of nurses like Plague. They torture and kill us. And then she collects our hospital wristbands as trophies. Shh, shh. Shh. Shh. Don't say I said anything. Go to sleep fast! Ah, David, you're up. I'm Nurse Bloch, but you can call me "Linda". Linda. I know your throat hurts. That's from the endotracheal tube during surgery. I need you to sip water. Thank you. And you should be... talking non-stop by tomorrow. Good. There's a lot of people who need me tonight, so I'm a little rushed. I need to turn you on your side to avoid decubitus ulcers. Do you understand? Mm-hmm. You may feel this a little. I know. I'm so sorry. This is an epidural, David. It's for the pain. Just count down from five. Five. David, can you hear me? David. Good. I thought I lost you there for a second. David, can you tell me, on a scale of one to ten, your pain level? Nine. It's a good thing you're not German. I would think you were just saying "no". David, this is a gel ball. It's to exercise your hand. You had some pretty bad nerve damage. Can you grab it for me? Go on. You can grab it. Good. Now can you squeeze it for me three times? One. Good. Two. Come on. You can do it. That's fine. I'll leave it with you, and you just do the best you can, okay? David? She wrote a "2" on your board. You said your pain level was nine, but she wrote a two. She does that all the time so she can control the painkillers. And she drugs us to shut us up. If you don't believe me, just ask... Well... What are we talking about, Harlan? - Nothing. - No. You were saying something to David. Go on. What was it? I was just saying I hope he feels better. Yeah, I hope he feels better, too. Maybe you can help by not telling him stories. David, what is your pain level? Bad. Okay. Let's work on that. Count back from five, David. Five. Hi. Hey. You have a question? I... I do. Should I be afraid here? Anyone with God doesn't need to be afraid. But I don't know if God is with me. He is. He's there. Where? I don't see him. David, you have to remember Matthew 13. Why? You remember the Euler triangle? Uh-huh. But I don't understand it. Remember Matthew 13, verse 25. I have to go now. Why? Someone's coming. No! - No! No! Don't! - Don't! - No. No, no, no. Don't! Don't! - You can't. No! No! No! No! No! Wait a minute. No. No. It's no meteor. That's for sure. Darndest thing I ever saw, the way that's unscrewing. Let me get that button for you, David. Nighty night, David. Must be somebody in there. Who? ♪ Evil 1x11 ♪ Room 320 JJ, it's me! We need to talk. Judy? Who's your friend, Ben? Uh, she's your replacement. Come on. We need your help. Judy James. How are you? It's Friday. I don't open the door on Friday. You meditating? I'm observing the universe. - Ah, this is Kristen. - Hi. So you're me? I'm... ? You're David's type... smart, intellectual. Where did you go to school? Okay, um, why don't I wait outside? Judy... you're being a bitch. We're here to discuss Richard Ghana. What about him? Well... The police think he tried to kill David last night. - We need his address. - What?! David was stabbed last night. He is at Harbor. He's out of surgery. Well, my God. Why? Well, that's why we need your help. I'm sorry. Ever since I left this job, I have become more suspicious. It's an occupational hazard. - We need Richard Ghana's address. - I don't have it. Well, I might have his roommate's address. Did he have any more contact with David? Ghana? No. I recommended he get professional help, and I thought he was. But you didn't know if he was? No. He had an injury on his hand from what he thought was a ghost, and it became infected. PTSD from a violent assault with severe psychotic features? See, I thought schizoaffective, but he didn't have enough mood symptoms. These coder companies practically breed this dysfunctional behavior. - Any risk of violence? - None that I saw. - Well, look, let's go. - What do you mean? We can retrace the steps of the Ghana investigation. Or you can just give Kristen and me the information, and you can stay here. No, I'm gonna go, too. You're gonna leave here on a Friday? It's for David. Come on. Follow me. Hmm. Morning, sleeping beauty. Harlan? Yeah. You remember my name. You're alive. Yep. You have a nice nap? What happened to your legs? What do you mean? Are they purple? No, they're just, uh... W-Weren't they... What, purple from the fluid build-up? Yeah, they put a tap in it, like a... like a maple tree, and drain all the syrup out. It's good for pancakes. Are you in pain? No, I'm just, uh... What-what time is it? Noon. "Control". How do I get control of my pain medication? Oral medication. Not that drip you're sucking down through your veins. - Isn't that what keeps the pain away? - No. Oral medication. You're seeing half of everything in the world because Plague controls it. You need to control it. - That's why I can't trust anything I'm seeing. - Yep. How do you know if you're being killed or not? Follow the yellow brick road. The... What does that mean? Pull it out. Pull? Yep. You need to control it. Oh... Don't say anything. I didn't tell you what to do. I don't understand. Is she real or is she not? Everything is real. What happened here? I don't know. I think it came out when I was asleep. Oh. I think pills would be better, in case that happened again, Nurse. Oh, you're talking more, David. That's a good sign. Let's fix this. And call me Linda. I-I think it would be better if we go with oral medication. Ow! Sorry. Can you tell me, David, on a scale of one to ten, your pain level? Nine. Good thing you're not German. I would think you were just saying "no". It actually hurts a lot. Okay, well, let's make sure this IV doesn't come out again. Good. I'm so sorry. We're worried about an infection. If you just give him another few hours, he'll be ready for visitors. - Is he conscious? - Not right now. Can we speak to the doctor? Yes. I'll have him come out in an hour. Has he said anything? - David? - Yeah. Not yet. He drifts in and out. We're really just worried about an infection. That's why we're keeping a tight supervision. We'd like to see him now. Detective Mira Byrd. Okay. David, are you ready for visitors? Yes. Definitely. Good. Let's work on your pain level. I'm-I'm fine. I don't... Stop... David. Your Eminence. How are you? Judy! What are you doing here? Judy? Hey. David, can you hear me? David, the police are here. They have something to show to you. David, hi. I don't know if you remember me. I'm Detective Mira Byrd. We have surveillance video from a convenience store a block from where you were attacked. We want to know if this is the man who attacked you. Yes. That's Ghana. He attacked me. Something's wrong with... He's been in and out of consciousness. I can call you when he's feeling better. Yeah, do. God is with you, David. We think we're on the trail of Ghana. We'll stop him. He's dangerous, Kristen. Don't. He'll attack again. He's hopped up on something. Shh. Shh. How is your pain level, David? Well, I'll see if I can do a little something about that. We just have to be careful because we don't want you to become addicted. It's starting. What is? Don't let them see you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry! I didn't mean it! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm... Help me. Please! Help... ! I'm sorry. What about him? No, he's not ready. Skin's too tough. No, no, no, no. I'll be good. I'll be good. I'll be good. I'll be good. What are you doing with him? Taking him to X-ray. Go back to sleep. No, it's a black mass! They're gonna sacrifice me! - Come on. That's not a real thing. - They're gonna sacrifice me! - Just ignore him. - No! - Sick people are afraid of the cure. - No, no, no, no, no. No! Come on. David. Are you all right? No. They're killing people. You have a fever. I'm supposed to be getting better. But they're making it worse. They're drugging me. Wait until tomorrow. There's another shift at noon. A new nurse. Wait for her, and she'll give you oral medications. Remember, noon. Noon? Take out the IV? Yes. Don't do it before. Listen for the squeaky shoes to be gone. Can you remember that? Is this real? No. It's a dream. How can it be true? Not everything real is true. - And not every dream is false. - No! No! No... ! Now, close your eyes and they won't know you're here. You'll protect me? Yes. Feel how cool my hands are? Think of it when you sleep. Think of Matthew 13. You have to remember it. - Yeah. What do you need? - Chris Simmons. - No. He's in Europe. - Chris. I can recognize you. Oh, you guys. I thought you were process servers. I'm being sued by everybody. Everyone's jealous of my success. It's a nightmare. You know why we're here? Yeah, Ghana again, right? Yeah. Do you have his address? No, I want to forget about that whole nightmare, okay? We were roommates for only a few months. I tried to help him out, you know. Throw him a few crumbs, but then he started using. Using what? Flakka. It's like bath salts, but worse. He used it so he could stay up late and work. Then he got violent. Ugh. Wow. - Did he do that? - Yeah. Caught me while I was sleeping. He'd steal my contacts, my friends, even my game ideas. I had this A.R. simulator about a bunch of demonic girls. Babydoll Revenge. Chris, do you remember the name of Ghana's avatar? Yeah, it was terrible. It was Rose something. Rose390? Yeah. Why? From the Haunted Girl? Yeah, that was the name of the game he was working on. Haunted Girl. He said it was the future. The firm fired him because he was nuts. Yeah. But he didn't want to let it go? How do you guys know about it? - The goggles. - Yeah. Do you still have them? Locked in my room. _ _ _ "But while the man slept, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and went away". What does that mean? I have to remember that. But how do I remember that? Oh, no. What happened here? Oh, I'm so sorry. I-I turned over and the, the IV caught in the drawer. I see that. - Hold that for me there. - I will. Um, could I can get my pain meds in pills? I hate needles. I know. Uh, let me check your chart. What's your pain level? Three. Yeah. Shouldn't be a problem. Thank you, Nurse, uh... Piper. Mm, you have a fever. I'm gonna get you something for that. Do you need anything else? No. Oh, my-my cell phone. - Where is it? - Uh, t-the closet. In my pants. Okay. I'll handle this. I know you haven't had a break today. Ah, thank you. His IV just got tugged out. Please, please. Don't-don't leave me. Oh, it's okay, David. Nurse Bloch will take care of everything. He wants his pain meds orally. Good. No problem. You got an infection 'cause you keep taking out your IV, David. I think you might need something a little stronger. I know you're in a lot of pain. Here we go. That'll protect you from any more accidents. We want you to get better, David. I'm on your side, David. I'm not the enemy. You want to get better, don't you? Good. So you think the girl in the goggles with my daughters, you think that's the guy who stabbed David? I am guessing. I just don't know. - These are you? - Yeah. So, what are you gonna do? I'm gonna lure him back into the game. Seems like he doesn't want to let this go. What are you doing? Creating an avatar. What are your daughters' names? Lynn? Lila? - Oh, no, no. You're not doing that. - No, no. They... uh... - T-They're gonna look completely different. - No, no. I don't care. I don't want you to use my daughters' names. - Use Ruth. - Ruth? What am I, an East Village lesbian? - Come on. - Ruth. - From the Bible. - No. No, that is way too on the nose. "Heather". - Fine with that. - Heather? Good. All right. Heather it is. Heather, light and stupid. - You need to add a voice modulator. - I'm on it. I think I'd like to play Haunted Girl. I think I'd like to play Haunted Girl. I think I'd like to play Haunted Girl. I think I'd like to play Haunted Girl. Maybe somebody will play with me. - Now what? - Well, now I play and I wait. What are you doing now? I'm opening myself up to Wi-Fi. How are you? Cute as a button. - So what do you do now? - Now we wait. If Rose390 is still out there, she'll find us. Psst. Harlan! Wake up. Hey. Psst. Hey. I need your help. I need you to get my... my pants. Hello, ma'am. Hello? Excuse me. Someone fell here. Ah! What do you need? Call Kristen Bouchard. Calling Kristen Bouchard. David, are you all right? Listen, help. Help... David, what is going on here? Just look at you. You're gonna kill yourself like this. Just push the call button if you need anything. You're only making this worse for yourself, David. What was that? David. What did he say? I think he said, "Help". Now he's not picking up. I'll be back. Oh, I got it, I got it, I got it. - Good luck with that. - Okay. Okay, get behind me. Get behind me so he can't see you. _ Hello. Hi. Do you know how to play this game? - Who are you? - I-I'm Heather. Um... My sister gave me these goggles, and I just want to know how to play. How old are you? Eight. How old are you? Ten. I've never seen you online before. Oh, because, uh, I had to create a new avatar because my mom found out, and she erased the old game. I-I was Lila, and my sister was Lynn in the old game. Oh. I have seen you online before. D-Do you have access to the spirit board? Every player in the game does. Look in your house. But my mom is home. I can't walk around the house to find it. I can't even leave this room. Hello. How may I help you? - I-I'm here to see David Acosta. - Kristen, it's not visiting hours. If you could wait until 5:00... No, I'm seeing him now. Kristen, it's not a good time. He fell out of his bed. David. As I said, he's been having difficulties. You called me. Why? You get well, David. What is it? You took a note from my patient in room 320. Is that a problem? I will need to see it. Why? I'm his nurse. If he has any concerns, I must be the first one to address them. You made a mistake. And why is that? Because... - David didn't have to tell me anything. - _ You following me told me everything. Kurt, I need your help at Harbor Hospital. So, where's the spirit board? Down this hallway. In the bedroom. No. Over here. Detective Byrd, this is a friend of David's. We think we have a location for Ghana. Excuse me, sir. It's Dr. Boggs, Nurse. I play golf every month with the board of nurses, so if you care about your license, I'd step aside. What the hell is going on here? He's been massively overmedicated. Excuse me. Who are you? Dr. Kurt Boggs. This is my patient. What is going on here? We were trying to make the patient feel comfortable. He's out of his mind. - How did this happen? - I'm sorry. - Let me find out what happened. - You better. Or you're gonna have a big lawsuit on your hands. I think we got the weapon! We're looking for a nurse. Bloch. Um, she-she was here a moment ago. Said she wasn't feeling well. Um, she's probably at her locker. Hey. Matthew 13.
