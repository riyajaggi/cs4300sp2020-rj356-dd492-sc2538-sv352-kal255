 Is your husband still off climbing? KRISTEN: Yes. Another few weeks. You take care of the kids, you pay the bills, you have the full-time job, and he's, what, off in Nepal. ♪♪ KORECKI: You took these photos? I did. And did our Vatican guests know you took them? No. And what do they mean? This is a map of evil.

 These are sigils, um, occult symbols representing a demonic hierarchy on Earth. KORECKI: And what do you want with it? You and I talked about evil becoming more organized, um, using technology, social media. - The 60? - Right. There are 60 sigils here. Some of them we've already encountered. Leland Townsend, Dwight Ferrell, the murderer of the three children. And the others? That's why we've come to you.

 We want to find the rest. Does your psychological adviser agree with all this? Look, when you talk about demonic evil, I'm out of my depth, but psychopaths seem to be aware of this document and organizing around it. These symbols seem to inspire them. All right. I'm going to approve some limited focus on this. Which of these symbols are you looking at next? Uh... This sigil was used in some recent paintings. The artist is local. I was going to talk to him. Good. Who is it? Your father? I'll wait outside. No. I'm fine with you going, but I want Kristen to go with you. - That's all right, I'll just wait in the car. - I don't need her to go with me. David, Kristen, you are both going. Now... One question: if he is one of the 60, what's your plan? So what is our plan? No idea. I'll stay out of your way. You talk to your dad. So I can find out whether he's sold his soul to the devil? No, he probably just saw the symbol somewhere. Just to warn you, my dad can be... a bit of a bastard. When's the last time you saw him? Five years ago. (PHONE RINGING) Oh. It's d'Artagnan. So are you officially abandoning us for reality TV? Yeah. That's right, I found my new calling. (OVER SPEAKER): Let's try it again. Okay. Uh, look, it looks like this is gonna take forever, so I'm probably not gonna be able to meet you guys. That's all right. We're heading upstate. Is your friend there? No, luckily. Do you know what you'd say to her? (SIGHS): No. Probably just, "Nice seeing you. Goodbye". Oh, you should call her again. No, three times is enough. Oh, okay. I-I got to go. You guys, uh, try not to get into too much trouble, and don't kill any demons without me. All right. (CHUCKLES) Promise. So who's the friend? Oh, it's just an actress from the reality TV show he was on, Vanessa. She gave him her number, and he called her three times, but she never called back. Ouch. Everything we do, he'll check and recheck because we don't run from the truth. BEN: Yeah, I'm skeptical because this show will need to convince me that there are ghosts and demons. You got to do it in sync with your lips. Yeah, but that's not what I said. We had to trim for length. That's not shorter, that's stupider. I said something about your show being a piece of crap. Look, we're trying to create a story arc here, and we need to start with you as dismissive of ghosts, not the show. All right? Let's try it one more time. We don't want to be here all night. Yeah, I don't want to be here all night, either, but this is a lie. It's TV. Doesn't have to be exactly true. Hey. Look, let's try it again, okay? Everything we do, he'll check and recheck because we don't run from the truth. Yup, I'm skeptical because this show will need to convince me that there are ghosts and demons. You sound pissed. Let's try it again, not so angry. Sure. Why not? ♪♪ (SIGHS) God, it's so great here. Not another house for ten miles. It's like the start of a horror movie. Oh, well, bad cell phone coverage. Guess all we need is car trouble, and we'll have won horror movie bingo. LEON: Son! (LAUGHS) Say it ain't so, say it ain't so. My son has returned. - (CHUCKLES) - Dad. Hey. Um, this is Kristen. - Kristen, hello. - Hi. Welcome to The Gully. I want to paint a T-shirt for you. Something... red. Listen, we're having a party. Come on in. I want you to stay the night, introduce you - to some people. - We have to get back. Oh, no, you don't. Humor your old man, okay? I want you to meet my wife. You got... you got married? Yeah. Few years back. You know how much I love marriage. Tell me, are you convincing my son to not become a priest? - Dad. - Oh. (CHUCKLES) I'll tell you right now: I want my seed spread far and wide. Is he talking about his seed again? - Hey, I'm in my 60s. What else am I gonna do? - (LAUGHS) This is Esther, the new Mrs. Acosta. Ah, it's so great to finally meet you. I want to hug you, but I'm still drying. Drying? KRISTEN: Wow. Did you make that? Yeah. I usually do it on other people, but I decided to make myself the canvas for once. How far along, Dad? Six months. You always wanted a brother. CORI: David Acosta. You are welcome. LEON: And this is Cori. Someone's got to keep your father in line. Why not a priest? I love what Pope Francis said about global warming. This is David's girlfriend, Kristen. - Ah! - Oh, I'm actually just a friend... - Cori's my other wife. - (CHUCKLES) - Your... ? - CORI: A throuple. Or, if we were Mormons, a marriage. Come. Come inside. I could use a hand with the punch. (GASPS) You have to stay for the Root Ceremony. - Yes. - We're calling on the ancestors. Everybody just suddenly started bleeding. Dougie is bleeding. Oh, my God. What is going on? Seriously? Yeah, that was good. Makes me look like an idiot. It helps with the story. Anyway, that's the last one. - We're done. - BEN: Good. - Hey. - Hey. How have you been? Good. How about you? - Fine. - Good. Okay. Well, see you. Hey, Ben. Yeah. I'm not sure what happened. What do you mean? Just so you know, one month is too long. - What is that supposed to mean? - What? You said one month is too long. - What does that mean? - Tony, can you turn off the internal mic? - (INTERCOM CLICKS) - I thought we connected. That's why I gave you my number. Yeah, that is why I called it three times. - No, you didn't. - Yes, I did. Called it the next day. I called it the week after. - I called it the week after. - Then who were you calling? - 'Cause you weren't calling me. - Okay, I get it. You're an actress, and... this whole thing is a performance, - and, uh... - I wrote my number on your hand. - And I called it. - I didn't get it. We got to get to work here. - Shut up! - Shut up! Show me the number you were calling. There. That is the number you wrote on my hand. That's not my number. Those numbers are transposed. That is the number that you wrote on my hand. (CHUCKLES) This was a bad beginning. This is what I suggest: just give me an hour to finish this ADR, and then... we should talk. Okay? Please? Glad you're here. So, a baby, huh? Yeah, but you'll always be my firstborn. Bouncing baby boy with the fat cheeks. (CHUCKLES) Hey, don't be jealous, now. Congratulate me. Congratulations. What's this, Dad? New painting. Not quite sure what it is yet. No, this. This symbol. I don't know. You like it? Seen it in your books, too. I didn't know you had my books. This some Catholic thing? I'm just trying to understand your process. Look, I know we, uh... hit that fork in the road. You danced off towards religion. I got swallowed up with art. What you feel when you pray or get a whiff of that incense, I feel right here, with color. The way Saint John of the Cross talks about mysticism, that's how I feel about painting. Someone... paints through me. My hand is divinely guided. By who? I don't know. Spirit, perfect muse. All I know is, when I'm painting, it's crap, but when somebody else paints through me... ... that's when it all comes together. How do you know it's not some... bad spirit... - (CHUCKLES) - painting through you? Now you're talking like a priest. There's no good or bad in art. The more years you put on you, you'll see. Duality doesn't exist; there's just what is. This symbol, it didn't appear in your paintings until three years ago. What happened three years ago? I don't know. I met Esther and Cori. They brought new life to me. So, how does a throuple work? (BOTH CHUCKLE) With great delicacy. Um, Tuesdays and Thursdays are ladies only. And the rest of the time it's first come, first served. Nobody ever gets jealous? Well... - maybe sometimes. - (CHUCKLES) But we're looking for a third, if you want. I'm sorry, I'm feeling - a little light-headed. - Sangria. When it's good, it's really good. KRISTEN: Did you put something in it? Love. A lot of love. $750 an ounce - of hallucinogenic love. - Mm... What's that? Oh, it's my pottery. Do you like it? What's that symbol? I don't know. Something I saw and liked. Why? You don't like it? I saw the same thing in Leon's paintings. Yeah. He takes it from Esther's pottery. The power of symbols. ♪♪ ♪ Evil 1x08 ♪ 2 Fathers (DOOR OPENS) (DOOR CLOSES) Hello, girls! I'm home! Anybody home? (SIGHS) (TRAIN HORN BLOWING IN DISTANCE) (TRAIN RUMBLING) Kristen? (SHERYL GASPING) - Oh... - Oh. Hey. Hey. - Hi. Yeah. Yep. Okay, yeah. - Sheryl. Yep. See you inside. Yeah. See you in there. Just please stop hanging out with my friends. - It's not my fault they like me. - (OVERLAPPING CHATTER) No, I didn't. And also, mind your own business and be quiet. (OVERLAPPING CHATTER CONTINUES) (CHATTER STOPS) Too much beard? ALL: Daddy! - Oh-ho-ho, my God, come to me! - Dad, you're finally home! - Oh, I am home! - Okay, Mommy didn't tell us. I know. I was gonna surprise you. Why I didn't tell Mom. Where is Mom? At work. Lynn-bo, come here, babe. Come here. Come here. (GRUNTS) - (GIRLS GIGGLING) - (GRUNTING) Mm. I know I've been gone a while. Did you miss me? At least a little bit? You've never been gone this long before. - But I'm here now. - Dad... - We missed you so much. - Was it hard, climbing... ? - It was a little hard. - Do you still have all your toesies? - I have three toes left. - Are they presents for us? Yes, they are. From the snows of Tibet. (EXCITED SHOUTING) You can open one each. One each. Whoo-hoo! Yeah! - I call this one! - (RINGS BELL) - How cool! - Look at this... - Mine's better than yours. - No, mine's... ♪ I don't got no money ♪ ♪ And I don't got nobody ♪ ♪ And I ain't got no place ♪ ♪ To live no more ♪ ♪ 'Cause she took everything... ♪ Are you drinking the sangria? - Am I? - Yeah. Yes. How many cups? Two. Why? We're gonna take an Uber back. It's spiked with psilocybin. Damn. What did he say about the sigil? He said he had no idea what it means. He said he just started painting it. Do you believe him? No. He told me this was just sangria, too. Esther said the sigil came from her. She introduced my dad to the Root Ceremony. It's a weekly séance to conjure up the ghosts of their ancestors. I think we should keep an eye on her. (BRIEF BEEPING) VANESSA: There are no cameras. No one's filming this. Okay, your team did that. (BRIEF BEEPING) Don't be scared, Ben. I'm with you. (HIGH-PITCHED): Vanessa, are you messing with me? What was that, Tony? I was just clarifying a line. I didn't say that. You could have. But I didn't. Yeah, but why does my voice sound weird? Oh, come on! Tony, we talked about this. - What? - You're pitching Ben's voice up an octave to make him sound wimpy. No, I'm not. I'm separating the voice from the background. Which you always do when it's a person of color. - You're giving Ben the scaredy-cat edit... - Vanessa, - I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that. - Oh, then pretend this. - (CLICKS MOUSE) - What the hell? There goes my ADR. There goes Ben's. That's eight hours of work. You are replaceable, Vanessa! Then replace me. And let's see what HR says about it. (SIGHS) Want to come over? Sure. ♪♪ Our ancestors are here. Their ghosts are among us. Let us lift up their spirits under those most high. We honor our fallen, remember our lost, and open ourselves up to their guidance.

I got to call your mom. - I thought she'd be home by now. - Can we talk? Sure. Nothing more - till I get back, okay? - (GIRLS CHATTERING) No, no, not without me. (GIRLS CHATTERING EXCITEDLY) So, how fast are you planning to leave this time? - Who's your new boyfriend, Sheryl? - That's none of your business. I don't know, you know? When we, uh, clean the sheets - out there, it's gonna be someone's business. - Okay. This is what I need from you. Oh, you need something from me? Yeah, I don't want Kristen to know that I was back there. Getting laid. (CHUCKLING) - Of course, that Andy charm. - Yeah. The frat boy way of looking at the world. Sorry, didn't you need something, Sheryl? Uh, yeah, yeah, I just... would rather Kristen not know - that I was back there with my boyfriend. - Why not? Because... - I don't think she likes him. - Why? Because she would rather I was single. Okay. So you want me to keep it secret? Exactly. Okay. So why is Lynn upset with me? (LAUGHING) Oh, my God. Why do you think, Andy? You've been away for three months, and your wife has had to deal with a lot: losing her job, getting a new one, and Laura's heart possibly stopping at any minute. That's why I came home early. What a prince you are. Yeah, thanks. - So? - So, uh, yes, sure, I'll keep your secret. I think it's probably good you're getting laid now and then. If only to remove the stick up your ass. Always such a joy to talk to you, Andy. - Isn't it, though? - Yeah. Who you calling? Kristen. But I think her cell's off. Okay, remember: shh.

And wipe your mouth. - Do we really have to... - go to school tomorrow? - Don't do it on the bedsheet. - Yes, of course you have to go to school. - (OVERLAPPING CHATTER) Here we go, here we go. - Up into bed, monsters. - I think there's a holiday. - No, there's no holiday tomorrow. - Yes, there is. It's called Daddy's Day. Okay, yeah, Daddy's Day means you go to school. - That's what Daddy's... - No. - What is this? - We need to spend time with you, Dad. I thought we'd outgrown the bedwetting. It's in case he comes back. He who? The monster in my bed. - Oh, what? - LILA: He's in Mom's dreams, too. I've heard her call him George. Mommy showed us he's fake, but it's just in case he ever comes back. - Not coming back. - Oh, that's nothing. Just wait until we tell you about Halloween. Like, there was this girl with a mask, and we almost buried Laura alive. - Oh, yeah. You should've been there. - What? - (OVERLAPPING CHATTER) - She, like, buried me in this big hole, and it was so... - What? - Oh, my gosh. We should play the game. You have to play! You have to play! You have to play, Dad! You don't have to play the game. Ben will play. - Ben? Who's Ben? - Oh, yeah. Ben the Magnificent. He's awesome. He comes here, like, all the time. - He's so, so funny... - (OVERLAPPING CHATTER) He's really nice. And he's really funny, too. Ben's around a lot. He fixes things. For Mom. LEXIS: He'll fix the game, too, - next time he's here. - Yeah. - So what is this game? - Oh, we have to go back into the game and say goodbye, or else the monsters will never leave. And where is this game? In Mom's closet. LILA: Um, it's an A.R. game. We got it taken away. - Yeah. - Okay. So we just need to go in there and, what, - beat the monsters? - GIRLS: Yeah. Well, what say we do it, Bouchard family-style? - Yes! Let's do it! - Okay! Lynn-bo, what do you think? Up to you. You want to come help? (MOUTHING) ANDY: Okay! - Yes! Let's go, let's go. - We're doing it. Come on. - (CRICKETS CHIRPING) - Annie? (SOFT CLACKING) Annie? Annie, is that you? David. You escaping already? No, not yet. What are you doing? Uh, new painting. What do you think? I like it. It's not so... severe. (CHUCKLES) I must have been in a good mood. Who's Annie? Uh, some friend of yours from the party. Said she was heading out here. Annie who? Commerce. Annie Commerce? Yes. What? She was in the party? Yeah. Why? What did she look like? (EXHALES) Mid-20s. Black. About this tall. Did she have scars? Yeah. Don't tell me you're getting ready to marry her, too. You saw one. What? An ancestor. What do you mean? Annie is part of our family. Died in 1859. She was given the last name of the ship she was transported on. Commerce. She was enslaved. "June the seventh, 1836.. On this day I received of Thomas Isner, the sum of $275, for the purchase of a Negro woman named Annie from the ship Commerce. 23 years of age and four months. Dark eyes. Sturdy and well-made. Given of my hand and seal. John Bertens". I don't believe this. There are records of her damages. The whipping of her arms for not letting go of the baby being snatched away from her. In 1850, some Harvard doctor went down south to photograph slaves. This is Annie Commerce. Is that the woman you saw? I... I don't know, I... (MUTTERS INDISTINCTLY) This... ? The slave-owner's brand. You use this in your paintings. Yeah. You said this was intuitive. I lied. Why? Because I birthed you and I knew exactly what you'd say. But that seal... is mine. It's the seal of a racist who owned human beings. It's evil. It's not... It's not you that's evil. It's... It's about slavery. ♪♪ Dad, this symbol is nothing but pain. That's right. There's pain in my paintings. And in my DNA. And in yours. And in Annie's. But that's not all that I am. And not all you are. What I know is that I'm in charge of how I shoulder that weight. So I reached out and reclaimed that brand for myself. Made it my property, not the other way around. To me, that's a symbol of resilience. Of grace. Beyond all measure. That's just not what I see when I look at that. I leave you that room. You leave me mine. You carry your weight the way you need to carry it, and I'll carry mine my way. But what's true... is we're both gonna carry it. I missed you, Dad. I know. I missed you, too. Look, is this really that big of a deal? I just don't know what to make of you believing that your sister is... there. You just seem so sane. - Thanks a lot. - No, come on. I mean, what do you want me to do with this? All beliefs look weird from the outside. You believe in quantum entanglement? Yes, because it's proven. You have two different particles in two totally different locations, and they impact each other instantaneously, at 10,000 times the speed of light. How is that possible? Wait a minute. Are you seriously comparing quantum entanglement to you believing that your dead sister is grafted to your left side? My right side. Wow! (LAUGHING): Wow. Okay. Shall we call it a night? (WHIMPERS QUIETLY) Okay. Uh, look. Hey, hey, hey, I'm sorry. You believe it, and... ... it's wrong for me to judge it. You're not just saying that? I'm not. ♪♪ What's wrong? Nothing. I-I, uh... I, uh... I got to go to the, uh, bathroom. (PANTING) What does it matter? Huh? What's the big deal? She's just a little nuts. What's wrong with that? Right? You don't have to argue about everything. (PANTING) Come on. It's fine. (PHONE BUZZING) Hello. Who is this? Hey, it's Ben. Um, I-I, uh... The caller ID said "God". Oh, yes. Um, sorry. I, uh, I changed my name in your phone. Anyway, listen. I, I'm-I'm here with a, um, well... with-with a woman. The friend that Kristen was talking about? Yeah. She believes that a invisible woman is grafted to the side of her body. (CRICKETS CHIRPING) Right? Insane. Okay, but I really like her, so, I mean, what do I do? Ben, I just saw a woman who was dead 160 years. O-Okay. So, what? What, just... just ignore the weirdness? The world is weird. - You'll have to show me what to do. - Okay. - Okay. - Don't get scared, but look up there. ANDY: Whoa! Come on. LYNN: I know. You'll get used to it. LILA: Go in Mom's room, you might find something. (OVERLAPPING EXCITED CHATTER) Show him the creepy girl. (GROWLING) - Okay, Dad, watch out. - Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! Watch it, watch it. (SIGHS) Now I see why your mom hid this stuff. You girls played this all by yourselves? Yeah, and almost beat it, too, before it just got weird. How much weirder can it get? - Oh, you have no idea. - A lot weirder. - Just wait for it. - Oh, great. - LYNN: Dad, through here. - ANDY: Okay. - Through here? - LYNN: Mm-hmm. All right. Okay. (SCREECHES) Oh, come on! That's scary. - Use a fireball! Fireball! - Okay. H-How do I... how... ? Okay, you make a circular motion with your hand, like this. - Yeah. - And then, then throw it out. - Like... that? - Mm-hmm. Dad, hurry. He's coming, Dad, hurry. - It's not working. It's not working. - LYNN: It's coming closer! (OVERLAPPING SHOUTING) Oh, you know what? I need, like, a cool catchphrase. - Dad, kill it! - Hey, long legs. How do you like your steak? (HISSING) - Well done. - (LAUGHING) That was the worst catchphrase ever. (OVERLAPPING CHATTER) I think I did it. - I think I did it, it was pretty cool. - There it is, Dad, there. Okay, let's go. What are you doing? Who is she? Rose390. She opened it up for us. Well, then, we need to close it. You have to leave it open. Oh, really? Why is that? 'Cause you won't be able to win if you close it. Okay. Then I guess we just won't win. (DEEP VOICE): Stop! Dad, she's dangerous. You know what? I think we can take her. Come up at me. (ROARING) - Dad? - It's okay. Here. Here, here, here. Here we go. Don't you dare! We are daring. Let's go. - Just right here, Dad, okay. - Yeah, yeah? - Huh? - Okay. Okay, just... - Just "goodbye". - Goodbye? Uh-huh, just goodbye. What now? I don't know. Good job, kiddo. Group hug! - Oh, Daddy, I knew you could do it. - There you go. - I missed you. - Oh, God, I missed you, too. Mmm. (CHUCKLES) (SIGHS) So I'm guessing we don't tell the monsignor about the sangria. I could entertain him with the story about how I helped a woman give birth to a ghoul. (BOTH LAUGHING) That sangria was dangerous. (SIGHS) ♪♪ This is you. Already? Already. Bye. Oh. Your sweatshirt. Oh, keep it. I don't want you to catch a cold on the walk home. (LAUGHS) All five steps? (LAUGHS) Mm-hmm? - Good night. - Good night. (DOOR OPENS) ANDY: Hey, stranger. Andy.
