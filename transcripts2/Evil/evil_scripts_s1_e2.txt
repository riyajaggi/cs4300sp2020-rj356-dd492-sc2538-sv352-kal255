 I need you on the stand to confirm your earlier testimony. You want someone to lie for you on the stand? You can get someone else. Not me. Your Honor. I work for the Catholic Church. So you're a priest? An assessor. My colleague Ben and I are hired by the Church to investigate unexplained phenomena. The Church has a backlog of about 500,000 requests

 for exorcisms and, uh, miracle appraisals. I didn't know that was a job. A night terror? Shadow figure was in my dream. Called himself "George." This guy Townsend, you know him? I've seen him, in other guises. That man is a psychopath who feels less alone when he gets others to do what he does. Don't you remember? Julia. Weepy little bitch. We got our next assignment.Hmm. And it's not demonic possession. What is it? A miracle.

 Is she joining us? I mean, I could have a look. Blessed art thou among women. Blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners, now, and at the hour of our death. Blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners, now, and at the hour of our death. Amen. Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. You know what I like about sex? Holy Mary, mother of God...That moment when you see in her eye that she wants you....pray for us sinners... Kristen wants you....now, and at the hour of our death. Amen. And when she bites you, oh, my God. Hail Mary, full of... And screams, like she's out of her mind. You can't tell me that's from heaven. You don't say she screams like a saint, you say she screams like a frickin' demon. I'm sorry. Did that distract you? Why don't you make up your own prayers? Why do you keep repeating that same old crap over and over again? Hail Mary, full of grace... Who's on first? ...the Lord is with thee. Blessed... I'm asking you who's on first? ...mother of God, pray for us sinners...That's the man's name. That's who's name? Yes. Well, then, who's on first? Yes. Go ahead and tell me. That's it. That's who? Yes. So, how does this work with a miracle? Well, we investigate the medical evidence, and you, as our psychological and medical advisor... I'm a medical advisor? Yeah, don't be too flattered. I'm the tech advisor. Well, you have four years of undergraduate training, so you win.And you're cheap. That's flattering. So you offer your opinion as to whether this evidence is beyond our scientific understanding. Is that her? Yeah. Naomi Clark. 18. Cardiac arrest in the middle of a college soccer game. When did this happen? Three weeks ago. She... No, no! No. No... Oh, God, oh... How long has she been dead? Almost three hours. Oh, my God. - Begin recording. - I'm starting an incision at 8:36 p.m. Patient was an 18-year-old African American female with no significant past medical history. First incision will be at the jaw line. There is no... Wow. It's not a miracle. I wish it were. We could avoid a lawsuit. But I don't understand. Your hospital declared Naomi dead at 5:33 p.m. Then, 177 minutes later, she sat up in the morgue. Look, I know you're invested in proving this is a miracle... No, actually, we're not....and I agreed to let the archdiocese ask me a few questions, but medicine has limits to its knowledge. You know, it's not all-knowing, and we're not God. Physiologies are different. Young people tend to bounce back sooner than expected. So you're saying it's because Naomi was young that she was able to bounce back? No. I'm saying the patient suffered from bouts of hyperinflation, and that gave the appearance that she was non-responsive. Hyperinflation? What is that? A condition in which the lungs lack elasticity. The excess air from CPR gets trapped in the lungs and keeps the patient from breathing freely. So the patient had COPD. Are you with the Church? Yes. She's our psychological advisor. Look, these were emergency circumstances. The patient was in cardiac arrest, and the first responders were inexperienced. They rushed the CPR and didn't realize her alveoli would be so inelastic. That's bull. So it's not hyperinflation?No. He's trying to blame us to dodge a malpractice. He says you were overanxious and kept administering CPR. 'Cause she was dying. We got our patient to the door. Rapid response takes over. So what do you think happened? You don't want to know what I think happened. Yes, I do. Look, I'm not religious. I don't believe in all that stuff, but come on. That girl was dead for three hours. I saw her dead. Lividity sets in after an hour, brain death after 90 minutes. Do you think it was a miracle? I don't know. I don't like that word, but... something happened. You can call it a miracle, you can call it just weird, but something happened. Do they have cameras in the operating room? Why? Just to see what life-saving precautions the hospital took. You mean the trauma bay. And, yeah, but they erase that stuff after a week. So what are you thinking? I mean, I think it's possible. It's happened before, COPD patient reviving after coding. But after three hours? That's just extreme. Did you ever work on a malpractice case at the DA's office?Yeah. Once. Why? Aren't these surveillance tapes considered evidence? Darryl. Kristen Bouchard. I thought you were fired.I was. But I just can't stay away from you. What you eating? Food. So what are you doing here? I heard that you're on this malpractice lawsuit at Harbor Hospital. I need surveillance footage from the hospital that night. Uh, why would I do that? Because I can feed you information on the hospital's defense. Kristen. Hey. Lewis.I'm rushing to court. Do you have a minute?Of course. Yeah. Let's talk, Darryl. Is your husband still off climbing? Yes. Another few weeks. What do you think about coming back for a short stint? You want me to come back here? Yeah. It's just a bad time to look for someone new. You could carry on the cases you already started. Well, my only worry, Lewis, is that I need a little bit more certainty than this job offers. And you have that certainty in your new job? I do. Okay. What kind of certainty are you looking for? We got the call. You got it? So you got this from one of the lawyers? Plaintiff's attorney. Okay. All right, give me a count. One, two, three, four, five, six... Are they rushing the CPR? No, it doesn't look like it. Pretty textbook. BP's falling. Still no pulse. What is that? I don't know. Power surge? Pulse. Weird. What? There power surges... Hold on. ...11, 12... Did you see that? What? Mmm. Hey, uh... do it again. What-- What is that? I don't understand. It's... it's been faked. What do you mean?BEN: I-I mean, hasn't anyone else seen this? A lawyer, but he didn't mention it. We almost played through it ourselves. It was just a flash. This is a re-used digital card. What we're looking at is an artifact of an earlier recording. You can find out? Oh, yeah. I'm going to. Too bizarre for you? You always seeing angels in your videos? Eh, Ben's probably right. It's just an artifact of a digital recording. Can I ask you something? Sure. So... you believe in miracles? I do. Do you think I'm crazy? No, I don't. But... I just want to understand. So... so you think that if you just pray hard enough, God's gonna grant you miracles? No, it's not like that. It's, um... God has designs with... within designs. And to us, they are impenetrable. My youngest daughter, Laura, she, um... she was born with a heart defect in her mitral valve. It's just a genetic screw-up. It's fate. You know, the-the muscle formed one way and not another. But there's a 50-50 chance that she'll die before she's 20. Just drop dead in the middle of anything, really. Walking, running, sleeping. Oh, my God. I'm... I'm sorry. That's okay. Doctor wants to see her in three weeks because the valve may develop on its own, and it may regress and in three weeks we're gonna find out which it is. It's weird, really. The future decided in one hospital visit. Just a flip of the coin. Heads, the valve's developing, tails, it's regressing and she'll... she'll be dead before she can graduate college. And if I thought that prayer would have any impact on it at all, I mean, I would be on my knees every single night. I wouldn't go out. I would pray so much, I'd shame the saints. But that's not how it works, is it? I mean, there are millions of religious people praying, and they still die of cancer or car accidents. And there are still bastards who survive to 90. So I don't understand the worth of prayer if it doesn't help. I don't know... I... but I'll pray for your daughter. I'll pray for Laura. Is she all right? She's great. She makes me laugh. I just don't understand how God could choose winners and losers. He doesn't. But if there are miracles, then some people get them, and some people don't, right? I mean, isn't that the problem with miracles? Not that they happen, but that they happen to some people and not to others. Do you want to drop out of this assessment? I would understand if you did. No, I-I don't. I... I want to do this. But, um... the DA's office did ask me to return. They're offering me a two-year contract to work with them. And you want to go back? I can't turn down the money. Well, when do you have to decide? Tomorrow. Okay. Well, uh... let me see what I can do. What happened? Laura! Laura, are you okay?LEXIS: Laura! Laura, are you okay? Mom, is she okay? Do you need water? Are you all right? Yeah. Was your teacher punching you again? Can I sleep with you, Mom? It's wet. Shh... I didn't wet my bed, Mom. Shh. It's okay. It's okay, just go to sleep. I didn't. It was a man. What man? He was scary. He had really big teeth and red eyes, and, like, you know, like a devil-person. And I couldn't move. He had a knife he was holding to my hand. Cutting off my fingers. ♪ I mean, that's what I don't understand. My daughter is seeing the exact same things in her nightmares as I am. And you never told her about the imagery from yournightmares?No. I would never. Kurt. I'm sorry. Second nature. How similar were your nightmares? Both have a demonic creature.Mm-hmm. With a knife. Cutting off fingers. That's pretty generic. Could she be reacting to the same imagery, like, a-a billboard you've seen together, or a... a drawing? I mean, I-- No, uh, not that I know of. Are you still working with that new job, that demonic possession thing? No. I mean, yes, I am, but now, um, it's focused on miracles. You're looking into miracles? Medical singularities. I'm fascinated. I did a cultural tour in Bali. Alternative cultures often use spiritual images in their psychological work. It has a great placebo effect. I should probably head out. Kristen... I have extra security now, to protect against theft. No notes. I think we should start up again weekly. Let me think about it. So... what do you say, Monsignor? She wants a two-year commitment? She's being offered one by her old job. And we don't want to lose her. And how is this assessment at Harbor Hospital going? The miracle? Well, that is debatable. You know the priest, Father Augustus? I do. I'm not sure God uses an alcoholic for His miracles. He used Moses. You just like being contentious, don't you? They call him the "miracle priest" now. So you want this all to go away? No, I-I just want an honest assessment. But I also don't want the Church embarrassed.Well, Kristin is giving us an honest assessment. And she's a deal. Okay. Okay. I'll get you the money. Interview Augustus. Make sure he won't embarrass us. Where'd you get this? Anonymously. What is that? I have no idea. Do you record over old digital cards? No. We do not. What isthat? I don't know. A ghost. An angel? What do you want it to be? Ooh. What? Uh, it's nothing. It sounded like something. What? I know who that is. Bernadette May. Who's that? She's a teacher's aide who was admitted to the hospital three days earlier, uh, with a migraine. So it was an old digital chip Well... I don't follow. All right, look, it's probably nothing. Well, then, tell us, what is it? Bernadette May died an hour before Naomi. From a brain aneurism. Well, I don't follow. The figure we saw in the video, the one floating. She died? This is starting to sound like a ghost story. Okay, so, look. I'm gonna check the recording and make sure that it wasn't manipulated. Why would someone manipulate it?Look, there are these things that are called deep fakes, okay? You can, you can, uh, manipulate the pixels and make it look like anything you want, you know? You can turn me into a goat, you can make me fly, whatever. So you think that's what this is, a deep fake? I don't know. Okay? I'm looking. Is he angry with me? No... he's just angry at the unsolved. Miracle priest, bless me. Heal me, Father. You faith has healed you.Bless me, Father. Put your faith in God. David. How are you?Hi, Father. This is Kristen. Kristen, Father Augustus. Pleasure to meet you. We're looking into the Naomi Clark situation. Situation? Is that what the Church wants to call it? What would you call it? Divine intervention. Jim... I can smell the whiskey on your breath. Maybe you heard, David. God uses the sinner and the just alike. Is that what happened? God used you?I don't know. I felt it. From her skin. Something. Sorry. I don't have visions like you. God never liked me. I talk to Him all the time, every night. He's the quietest roommate in the world. What did you whisper to her? Naomi? In the video?Prayer for the dead. No, no, no. You held her hand and you whispered something in her ear. Oh. "Don't go. Stay. Please, God, let her stay." I know. Not much of a prayer. I'd just given last rites to another woman upstairs. She died of a brain aneurysm. Bernadette May? Yeah, she-she grabbed my hand and looked at me. She knew she was dying, but there was this look of peace on her, like she saw what was coming. My hand was still warm from her when I went to the morgue. That's why I held onto Naomi. I didn't want her to go. She felt something. I know she felt it. So, uh, you have visions? Well, a few years ago, I saw... things. It was like a dream or something. Anyway, that was a long time ago, and I was under a lot of stress and it was just after my friend died. Julia? Yes. It gave me hope when I needed it. But you haven't had any visions since? No. What's that? I don't know. I'm trying to figure out if this is a fake. Is this for your priest? It's for my job. Your job for your priest. Where's this from? It's a hospital surveillance camera. Dad's asking if you're coming in for prayers. Yeah, I know, but you can't blame him for trying. What, that's it? That's it. Six frames. I don't know. Something's up with the pixels.Mm-hmm. If it's a fake, it's a good one. What is she supposed to be? Someone who's dead. Yeah, I know. She died an hour earlier. Lewis. I have those two outstanding cases I promised you. Oh. Great.Here you go. And I'd really like to thank you for the contract offer, but I think I'll have to pass. This new job, it's... No need to thank me. Actually, we came into an opportunity overnight. Another forensic psychologist, one you faced in court. In fact, I need you to update him on the two cases you were working on. Leland! It's good to see you again. Lewis, this guy, he's a psychopath. Oh, come on. No, I'm serious. He fed information to the serial killer LeRoux, and he encouraged him to kill. He already told me his account was hacked. That is a lie.I saw the evidence, Kristen. He's a liar. He stole my therapy notes. He got the better of you in court, okay? But...I get that you're angry, but he's a good forensic psychologist, so please brief him on your cases. Kristen. Kristen, you left your notes in the office. They're not mine. I know. I just wanted to talk to you. We have nothing to say to each other. You must be kidding. We have everything to say. You're just gonna overturn everything I did on these two cases? Argue to release the guilty? Imprison the innocent? Yeah, but not because I'm bad. Because you're easily persuaded, Kristen. You're too soft. You said so yourself in therapy session number 12. How's David? Here's the most important thing to remember about David: He sells himself as this good man, but ask him about the second time he saw God. I have no idea what that means. Yeah, that's why you need to ask him: "Tell me, David, about the second time you saw God," and trust me, it's a good story. Good luck with your "miracle." Mom! Mom! Daughters! Who'd you kill? The postman. He was trying to deliver mail and... All right, well, don't forget to clean up with Lysol. We will. We got it!You're home a little late. You said 8:00. Yes. And thank you for being so patient, Mom. She wasn't so patient.Yes, she was. I watched your scary little show. I'm getting way too old for this. What happened? You look like something went wrong. No, I'm-I'm-I'm just... I'm just really happy to be home with my mom and my daughters.Okay, so you're not gonna tell me. So what are we watching? A scary show. Wow, that is so nice of Grandma to just let you watch whatever you want. Okay, I'm leaving now. Hey, kids, listen up-- misbehave, okay? Do not listen to your mother. Okay. I love you, Mom. All right. Mom, don't joke like that. What are we watching? You've seen it, Mom. You said it looked good. What did you do with the toy spider, and the... So do I have to watch it from the beginning? No, they moved into a new house. And it's haunted. - Dad! - Where's the mom? Oh, she's dead. She died in a car crash. Oh, of course she did. Why'd you say it like that? Well, because in movies, the mom's always dead. Movies hate moms. Okay, turn out the lights. Guys, is this really a good idea? I'm not even scared.I'm a bit scared. You're really gonna like this part. Don't open the door! Oh, my gosh! Don't open the door! Mom! Are you kidding me? I don't want to have to cover your mouth. But why would she open the door if it's so... What are you doing?That's the only part I wasn't scared. Bedtime.That's the only part I wasn't scared. No! Mom! Let's go. You've let us watch a lot worse. And moms sometimes make mistakes. Yeah, maybe this is the mistake. Yes, maybe. Let's go. Upstairs. Bedtime. Maybe we'll have nightmares if you don't let us watch it. That's exactly how that works. Let's go. No, Laura, hold on, wait one second. I want to ask you something. What? What did I do?Nothing. I just want to ask you something. No, you guys all go up.That's so unfair. She's just gonna convince you to watch... That thing in the video, that demon, is that what you saw in your nightmare? Mm... You said it had a knife and big teeth. I think when you have dreams and nightmares, it usually comes from stuff you saw during the day. Is that why you didn't want us to watch it? I think I saw it, too. I don't remember when, but I think I saw that same thing in my nightmare. But now that we know, we can face it. It's not real. It's just from that TV show. Streaming.Streaming show. So don't be scared. It all makes sense, okay? Can I sleep with you? One more night? Who is it? Hey! Laura, Lexis, Lynn, Lila! Open the door! Lila, Lila! Bad dream? Try counting sheep. You're part of my mind. You're not even original. You're from a bad TV show. Bad? Well, that's just hurtful. Hmm? Oh... You know what's great about a night terror, Kristen? You can't move. Just your eyes. Watch the knife. Wake up. Wake up. Well, just grab the knife, Kristen. Come on, move that hand. How hard can it be? Wake up. Wake up. How about her heart? Which valve shall I take out? The mitral? Why are we waiting until she's 20? Let's finish it now. Laura, please. Laura, please, wake up. Mom, wake up. Mom! Mom! You were having a nightmare. I know. I'm sorry, I was. Oh, my gosh. I'll hold you, Mom. You go to sleep, I'll hold you. Thank you. You're such a good baby. You're my sweet baby. And this was yesterday? Yeah. What did he say? He said he was gonna reverse everything I did. Every innocent person would be guilty, and every guilty person would be innocent. And did you tell your boss? Yeah, I told him Townsend was a psychopath, and he thought it was professional jealousy. He also knew that we were investigating a miracle. He's coming after us. Why? Why, David? Why is he coming after us? I want to tell you, but it's not a language you believe. Because you think he's a demon? Yes. So tell me in language I'll believe. He wants to kill hope. He also suggested I ask you something. What? He suggested I ask you about the second time you saw God? What does that mean? He wants to divide us. Why would that divide us? I had a vision. Now I don't. He's playing on my doubt. And yours. There wasn't, like, a-a tunnel or a light or anything. I remember seeing my coach yelling from the sidelines. And then I felt my face on the ground. And then I saw this hole opening up in the grass, a black hole. Just, like, this... big, swirling thing. And then I saw people coming out of it. A lot of people. 60 of them? And they were coming for me. And then I saw a woman take my hand. I didn't know who she was, but my parents said that there was another girl who died. Bernadette May.Right. She took my hand, and then I felt this on my cheek. And that's when I woke up. Do you think what happened to you is a miracle? Um, I don't know. Uh, all I know is that I was dead and now I'm not. And that everything has changed for me. I can't figure out how they faked this. We checked the pixels. There's no apparent manipulation, so either this is so good that we will never know how they did it...Who's "they?" "They," just figurative "they." You know, not-- O-Okay. Ju-- Or... ground-looping. And what's that?Okay. You see this, uh, surveillance footage of Bernadette May an hour earlier? And this is our footage of Naomi.KRISTEN: Mm-hmm. These images were transmitted to the security station which recorded them. Now, ground-looping is when those two transmissions cross. So you think the image of Bernadette Over Naomi's image. That's right.Right. So, if that's true, the image of Bernadette's face should at some point appear on the monitor. Yep. And does it? Well, I've gone through through several hours of surveillance footage. Right now, have seen nothing yet, but... ♪ Okay, you know what? I'm gonna go back to the beginning. Wait. The doctor just called the time of death. Yeah, so? I think I know what happened. It's not a miracle. So I'm glad you've agreed with us it's not a miracle. Yep. Turned out to be hyperinflation and undiagnosed COPD.Good. But it wasn't the, uh, paramedics' fault. Well, I think we'll have to agree to disagree on that, but it's good we're on the same side. Uh, what are those? Emergency lifesaving efforts of this hospital over the last year. 176 in all. Okay. These are your Caucasian patients. Did you know that, on average, during a code, your doctors performed 58 minutes of chest compressions and rescue breathing on Caucasian patients? Patients like, uh, Bernadette May? No, I didn't. And these are your African-American patients. Your doctors, on average, performed chest compressions and rescue breathing for 23 minutes on them. Patients like, uh, Naomi Clark. It is the stated position of this hospital that it does not distinguish on the basis of race. Naomi Clark came back to life in the morgue because your ER staff called her time of death 30 minutes earlier than if she were white. That's why this wasn't a miracle. It was implicit racism. I think you should get out of here. Here, I'll leave these for you. The ethical review board already reviewed our actions. And the malpractice suit has already been settled. You might want to check on that. You might want to look at that before you settle the Harbor Hospital suit. Why? What is it?Evidence for a civil rights lawsuit worth about $15 million. So, it was not a miracle? No. A combination of gross incompetence and a medical condition that kept Ms. Clark's lungs from absorbing oxygen. Okay, good work. I have another possible possession for you... Actually, there's one other thing. A patient died an hour earlier, and this is an image of her on the hospital videotape. This has nothing to do with the miracle? No, it's just an apparition we can't explain. Okay. Well, then, let's let that go. Now, this possession we want you to look into, It's a good parishioner. She gives a lot to the Church... ♪ Mom, hey. Okay, it's not working. I saw what you were watching. Mom, just let us watch the end, please. Come on. It's not that scary. It's more funny than scary. It's actually hilarious. We were laughing so... Okay, this is what I say. I'm gonna watch it with you. we are gonna all watch this together. What is it? Just watch. Um, typically it takes, to make a monster, it takes about three hours. What is this?It's a video on how they do it. There are a lot of elements to this character. There's a bodysuit, there's a cowl piece. There are two ear pieces. There's teeth, and then our horns... It's good for us to know it's not real. It's all make-believe. Well, my ideas come to me while I'm sleeping. They come to me in the form of nightmares. I translate that really quickly into a sketch or, like, a quick clay sculpture, only to be translated into a full-size character later. Do you, uh, like playing monsters? Monsters scare me when I see them on TV or film, but when I'm playing one, it's not that bad. It's fun to scare other people as the monster. Oh, my God. ...as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us... as we forgive those who trespass against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from all evil. ♪ Play... Where's your girlfriend? Gone.
