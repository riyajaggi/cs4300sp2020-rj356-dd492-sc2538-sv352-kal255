 Previously on "Dare Me"... I owe you a practice. I want to see you fly. - What's that? - Hamsa. You know, they used to believe it would keep people from cursing you, especially if they're jealous of the things you have. Do you ever want things that you can't have? Shit, I'm jealous every second, every day. This a party or a home invasion? It's a squad.

 This video we're making needs to be flawless. Ooh. Oh. You want that dick. I'm not into your dick. Show me what else you got. Ice bath, it's a top girl rite of passage. I'm... I'm strong. You can quit at any point. Every woman wears a mask. Coach told me that once. It's how we face the world. It's how we face each other. The mask promises perfection... And conceals all our flaws.

 "But remember one thing," Coach always said. "Never let your mask fall... Unless you have another one in place." Hey, queen. Quit watching yourself. Come stunt with us. I'm not watching myself. So damn tight. Born tight. You know, I really thought she might come this time. Enter enemy territory? No way. Yeah, but what is she doing after practice every day? Money can't buy you class, but it sure can buy you a fuckton of inland sushi. My daughter, the sophisticate. How did I miss a whole season of these leathery housewives and their dirty deeds? You missed nothing. Carole is gonna forgive Bethenny 'cause Carole has no story without her. Don't tell me you're on Bethenny's side. Without Bethenny, Carole's just another thirsty bitch. But Bethenny is all drama. And without drama, there is no show. True that. I guess somebody's gotta get the bitch edit. There's no fighting it. Women can never win. Eagled up, hey! Eagles, you know what to do. Get out your seats and Eagle up too! Watching the video today and watching myself, that was the first time I really thought that we could make it to regionals. We can. We will. Should know for sure in a week or so. Then I guess my good luck charm worked. Here. Your hamsa bracelet? You should have it... If you want it. Oh. Can't say no to magic. Hey, Mr. Coach. - Hi. - Hey. This, uh, still the party or the after-party? Oh, they're celebrating. Right, the video, yeah. Um, thing is, I have this big presentation tomorrow. Oh, aren't they all big? I mean, it's Bert Cassidy, right? Maybe they could go home and watch it with their... You know, with their parents. Their parents... are parents. They don't care. Come on, 30 more minutes. Okay, now even JV Pixy Stix are talking about it. It's real, isn't it? Real as a heart attack, motherfuckers. Playland Motel, Friday night. Ooh, the infamous den of sleaze and statutories. Remember when we passed by on that fifth grade field trip and we saw the hooker with the pink dog? You know, my mom's basically there every night. Well, you're gonna have to hide your virgin eyes, Addy Hanlon. We're gonna have to get you a permission slip. I'm in. Besides, Faith never minds if I spend the night at your place. Oh, I meant from your girlfriend, Colette French. She ain't gonna be approving of the company we'll be keeping. by QueenMaddie Were your ears burning? We're the talk of Cleveland. Not that hard, it's Cleveland, but word on the street is, the committee is hot and bothered over the bid video. Well, they should be. I haven't missed a regional since I started coaching, and I'm not interested in changing that. Nor I, and I'm glad you took my advice and did a little Spielberg-ing on that video. I laughed. I cried. I didn't. I didn't break any of the rules. I didn't need to. Ah, there she is, queen of the jungle. Schoolgirl on the outside. Inside, General Patton. Knew he liked 'em cold, but necrophilia is a new color for Bert. You don't mind if I take both my top girls, huh? All yours. Oh, thank you. Thank you as a father and as a booster. This better be epic and include gifts. - I got practice. - Not today. Today I'm taking you someplace I value even more than practice. Massage parlor? Well, a massage of sort, for the mind. Well, it's as good a day as any to join a cult. - Address? - You're riding with me. Let's go. We're late. Tacy's been waiting in the car for ten minutes. Okay, huddle up. New plan for today. Something came up, so Hanlon is leading the charge. Conditioning drills, 60 minutes. Then you're all free to go home early. Walk me out. Coach, are you sure this is a good idea? Tomorrow's Friday. It's an away game. JV can cover. If... when... you make it to regionals, I will show you what it means to work. Until then, we need to preserve squad strength, so not waste it on sideline bullshit. Okay. Ride 'em hard. Do me proud. Check your texts later. All right, you heard Coach. Serpents. I said serpents. Okay, look, Beth isn't here and neither is Tacy, so whatever bad top girl blood you tenderfoots got left, put it aside... Because it's distracting you from what you can do and who you can be. I wanna see sweat, blood, and tears. Line up. Go. Tighten up. Get lower to the ground. Come on, don't be lazy. The water was like ice, and she was relentless, and I was shaking all over. And I thought my heart would stop. Beth, why don't you just apologize, make everyone happy, so we can get the rest of our afternoon back? I think people should be responsible for their choices, even very small, weak people. This is really about accountability. I didn't give myself borderline hypothermia. You seem frustrated, Beth, but we're all here for you. We just want to understand what led you to act out in this way. Act? I never laid a hand on her. She's precious cargo. Just ask her father. She never laid a hand on... on you? My heart could have stopped. I nearly drowned. She made me with her mind. It was a competition. She chose to participate, and she lost. This isn't the Stanford Prison Experiment, Beth Ann. - You can't... - Can you imagine if someone actually wanted to take advantage of her? Hmm? I mean, if she succumbs so easily to perceived peer pressure from her own sister. Am I the only one that sees the problem here? She does kind of have a point. I think you might all want to book some regular sessions. No, no, no, no. It's a complex situation, yes, but the part that you need to understand is that her mother is a completely different woman than her mother, I mean, opposites exactly, and... and there is a lot of, uh, well, let's call it rage floating around that household, uh, sometimes masked by a pharmaceutical stupor, uh, somewhat. But it's there always, uh... In short, a woman was scorned, and now we're all in the crosshairs. He's probably right. It's been... It's been really hard... For all of us. And I guess I've just been, um... I've been really confused... And overwhelmed... Ever since I saw Bert fucking my mom again. - Okay, we're done here. - What? Oh, my God, we are done here. We're done. Come on, let's go. Go, go, get your purse. Let's go. Let's go. Unbelievable. Sorry for making you wait. He kept asking for ten more minutes, and I... I had to give it to him. I couldn't say no. So you just left your car at school? I did. I left practice and just got in Will's truck in broad daylight. I didn't care, Addy. I really didn't care. It just feels so good to be free, you know? No complications. I didn't have that when I was growing up. Neither did he. So why'd you guys break up? Oh, no, we weren't together, not like that, not how you're thinking. Homecoming junior year, he wasn't even my date. I... I don't know who I went with. He came with this senior girl. While they were crowning the king and the queen, we snuck out to the baseball dugout. I was wearing my spikiest heels, and I... I kicked a hole in the roof. Took my heel clean off. He smelled like Ivory soap. When I saw him here last month, just... Oh, my God, stop me. No, I'm not stopping you. Will is definitely worth... canceling practice for. I didn't cancel practice for Will. I didn't cancel practice. You led. I did. And it was awesome. I knew you'd like it, running the show. You were born to it, you just didn't know it. Hey, what's this? Predator alert. Slocum's just looking for college money. And no Sarge Stud today. Guess he's making use of that silver hurricane tongue elsewhere. That'd explain why Coach canceled practice. Oh, you heard. Oh, I hear everything. Don't you know that by now, Hanlon? So where did you and Tacy go yesterday? Orthodontist. Bert found a good two-for-one deal. That or he's searching for wife number three. You have perfect teeth. At least my lie is better than Coach's. What was her excuse for canceling? What, getting those roots done? Running home early to make a pot roast for poor Mr. Coach, the little cuckhold? Thought we were done with this. We were, till she leveled you up to boss bitch mode. That I would have loved to see. Hanlon in heat. I'm sure I'll see it again soon, maybe tonight. Playland? Never seen you hype a party so hard. What's your angle? Can't I just want to have fun with my friends? Every woman has her secrets. What is that, some military thing? If you had it in high school, I never would have let go of you. Oh, that was my mistake. I'm here now. Did you lock the door? What, you don't trust me? I trust you. Be easy to explain anyway. You're just doing your patriotic duty. Oh, is that what I'm doing? I don't know, you tell me. You got everything you wanted, right? What's that like? 'Cause I have no fucking idea. Shit. Shit. Shit. - What? - I... my kid. I... fuck. I messed it all up. I gotta go. - Let me help. - No. Stay here. Wait to leave until I'm gone. Hi. Can't believe they let me shoot. Owner of the range did two tours in Iraq. Different detail, same shit. We all look out for each other. You gotta grip it tighter, a lot tighter than that. Damn, nice shot! Hard being this talented and this beautiful. Huh, shoulda headed to Hollywood instead of Parris Island. Yeah, how come you signed up? Had to beat a charge. Slocum, uh, aren't you... Don't you need to get going? Man, I sure do. Bus leaves at 6:00. Boyle Township linebackers are out for blood. Thanks for letting me use your gun. No worries. Good luck tonight. Thank you. See you guys. So what time do you guys want to head over there tonight? No disrespect, sir. Uh, don't you think that's overkill? We don't wanna come on too strong. Kid's been receptive to every overture we've made so far, right? Better he thinks all this is his idea, you know, sir? He's gotta own it. Yeah, I guess we give him a little breathing room. You two take the night off. But I don't want to get another call from the gentlemen's club over in Sterling Heights. Whatever shit you guys get into tonight, leave those guns at home. I'm going out. Don't wait up. Your back hurt again? Yeah, baby. Are you going back to see that chiropractor? I want to, but I can't afford it. Can't afford him. Can't afford the mortgage. Can't afford your phone bill or your credit card. So it's my fault that you have epically bad taste in first husbands? It's your fault because you can't keep a goddamn secret and you go and vomit it out to that little brat across the street. You know how hard it is to get him to pay the child support, alimony, and now... Well, it beats sitting here like a punching bag waiting for a handout. - Don't you get it? - Get what? You have to play the part, smile and smile, give him what he wants, just like she does. Bethy, this is how you get through life. Apologize. Make it right. I can't. I won't. Maybe it is my fault. I made you think you can be anything, do anything. One day, you're gonna grow up and see how things really are. I hope I never grow up at all. There we go. Open up. Don't ruin the jawline contour. Shh. Shh. Where are you? Are you at Beth's? Yeah, I was thinking I would just spend the night here. Mm-hmm. Junk food, face masks, talking about boys. Something like that. I'll text you later. What are you doing in there? Hello? This is a public restroom. I gotta go. Bye. Bye. Hit me. Ooh, Addy Hanlon's back. Oh, yes, I am. I love it when we're all together like this. Close. There we go. - No. - Cute? Oh. It's too clean. You want it dirty. Better than a basement kegger. How do we ever go back? The marines, this is their party? Surprise... You wanna call Coach? I think we should do as she does, not as she says. Kurtz looks good tonight, like a farm boy gone bad. Shut those thighs, RiRi. - I got this one. - Mm. Don't you know it's bad luck for a stripper to put her shoes on the table? What kind of stripper has an ass like this? None I've ever seen. Hey, Tibbs, turn that shit up. Get it up. Well, she's asleep. Have at it. Have at what? You made an honest mistake, right? Drop the act. You know you want to. What? You know what I want is, uh, a wife who cares enough to remember to pick up our daughter. I got there five minutes after they called you. So, what, you just forgot? Their schedule was different. They had to close early for something, so, yeah. And I was distracted, with work. You know, the bigger mystery actually is how they even had your number. Have you ever picked her up? I mean, we both have a job. Are you kidding me? We have different hours. Oh, right, and your job is more important than mine because you put on a tie and you carry a briefcase. For ten months, my job was all that we had. Oh, man. How long you been holding onto that one? You know, we could have stayed in Chicago. We didn't have to come here. We agreed it was the plan, right? You think it's easy working for Bert? I work for Bert too, and for the school and for all of the other booster parents on top of me doing every single thing it takes to keep this house going. We didn't have to buy this house. We don't have to stretch ourselves this thin. You're the one who wanted the house. You love a pretty front. I wanted a home for us. You know what? I don't regret asking my parents for the money, but it's not even our home anymore because every night, I come home to some "Spring Breakers" blowout! Will you be quiet? You know, we're never alone. Does that even bother you? Or is that what you want? Look, all I'm asking is to have my wife back and not be living with some little, wild teenage girl out to prove something. God, it must be so nice to be a guy, to be applauded for just showing up and trying, maybe seeing your own kid every once in a while, unloading the dishwasher once a week because I'm doing it the wrong way. You think I'm avoiding responsibilities? I'm not. I am just juggling everyone else's trying to be perfect every single second. Nobody's asking you to be perfect. We just want you here with us. Right, smiling for the family portrait in the picture-perfect house that we can't afford? Some nights, cooped up in this, trapped, it makes me want to scream. It makes me crazy. - Yeah! - Drink two! I win. Oh! I won, sorry. We heard the party from across the hall. Musta missed my engraved invite. You wouldn't kick me out, would you, a pretty thing like you, huh? Fuck off, dude. All of you go, go, fuck off. Get in. Shit, the JV showed. A condition, though. Turn 'em over. House rules. Thank you. Are those girls even 16? This is gonna look really bad if the sarge finds out. He won't, not this time. Lean back. Have some fun. It's called a night off. Chug, chug, DJ! Yes, this is the room. Hey, thanks, man. I mean, the gun range, coming to the game, it... it means a lot. Hell, it's not like I had anything better to do. I know we've been giving you the hard sell, but this life isn't for everybody. You know, there are sacrifices, and it might seem like an easy decision at 17. I mean, I know it did for me, but... The longer you go, those people that you leave behind, well, that's where they leave you behind. You mean like a wife or something? Or something, yeah. Shit, was that how it went for you? No. No, I had a wife. But, uh, I don't have her anymore, so... Sorry, it's a... It's a long story best told over something stronger than this. Sorry, I mean, it's... It's none of my business anyway. Ah, don't sweat it. It happens to a lot of guys. Somehow you just wind up alone. Hey, where did Beth go? You're always Beth's girl. That's why we could never be tight before. She never wanted to share you. I was always so afraid of her. Everyone's afraid of Beth. And you. Me? - Hey, give it to me! - No! Hey, up yours, whore. You're a limp dick piece of shit. Just give it. I'm calling the police! It's ringing! I want the police here right away. Hey, there's something happening. Oh, he's calling the cops. We gotta get you guys out of here. - Come on. - Shit. All right, all of you, this is not a drill. The party's over. Come on. We gotta go. We gotta go. - Phones! - The other room. Okay, come on, let's go. Beth, where's Beth? Beth? Can you open the door? Bro, you gotta wake up. Dude, wake up. The cops'll be here any minute. Kurtz, you gotta wake up, bro. Shit, this is Beth's. - She's gotta still be here. - Uhuh. We don't have time for this. You know how bad this looks? I'm not leaving her. You need to get out of here, okay? Fucking go now. You... help me. Hey, have you seen my fr... Ugh, forget it. Beth? Beth? - What are you talking about? - Just give it back. Beth? Beth? Look, I'm sure it's okay. Girls like that know how to handle themselves. You don't know what the fuck you're talking about. She's down there. Hey, come on. - Hey. - What? Are you okay? Did somebody do something to you? Did someone slip you a pill? Where were you? Hey. What are you saying? - Please? - Your bracelet. - What? - Your bracelet. Fuck it. Let's just wait for the cops. They'll know what to do when they get here. No, we're not doing that. - My mom's a cop. - Well, what if she took something? Can you just go? You're not helping. Okay, so you're sure you can handle this? Yes! Seriously. Go! Okay, we got it. My husband, you were anxious to talk to him, weren't you? Yeah, I was, but... I'm sort of getting over the idea, if you know what I mean. There's a speed limit in this state, Mr. Neff, 45 miles an hour. How fast was I going, Officer? I'd say around 90. Suppose you get down off your motorcycle and give me a ticket. Suppose I let you off with a warning this time. Honey, no, no. You cannot bring her here, not tonight. It is not a good night. Take her to your house. Your mom will know what to do. Look, okay, yeah, uh-huh, I know that you think that you're in trouble, but you're not, okay? Are you her friend? Uh-huh, uh... So be her friend. Fix it. Hanlon, the bitch is your problem. Colette, who's there? I got it. I thought you were smarter than this. Get in. You clearly came here because you need something from me. What do you want me to do? I don't know, I just thought that you could help, maybe help her. Help her? What, help her get less drunk? I think you know how to get less drunk, don't you? You wait. You go home and you sleep. You do not come to my house. I found her passed out in my car. - I thought maybe... - I told you not to come here, not tonight. What are we supposed to tell him about this? How am I supposed to explain this? I'm sorry, Coach, but you don't understand. The cops were coming, and Sarge Will's guys were there. Shut... up. Sorry. I'm sorry. I am not your mother, Hanlon. I expected more from you, so much more. Dutiful daughter, happy wife, devoted mother, all-American girl, these are the masks we wear, all of us... All the time, everything in place, the smile always there, never slipping, not once. "You must be strong," Coach said. "You must be vigilant, "and here's the most important thing: "never show yourself. No one wants to see the real you."
