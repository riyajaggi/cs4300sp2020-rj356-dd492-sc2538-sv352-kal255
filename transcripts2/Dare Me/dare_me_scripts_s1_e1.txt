 [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [AMBIENT SYNTH MUSIC] There's something dangerous about the boredom of teenage girls. Coach said that once. But she said it not like a mom, or a teacher, or a guidance counselor. She said it like she knew and understood. ♪♪ Coach saw something in us...

My husband, Matt, he has a chance here. He hasn't had many chances... Not like he thought. And he's given me so many. I owed him. It's grown-up bullshit, right? No. I mean, I don't know. I don't know many married people, though... I mean, that are still married. Maybe you'll be smarter than I was, Hanlon. About all this. Maybe you already are. Uh, that's me. You're not like the others. But you know that, don't you? [QUIETLY] Yes. So that's the new coach? The blonde lady that couldn't stop and introduce herself? Hey, I got the, uh, stuff you wanted.

Got the shit kicked out of them tonight... - [LAUGHTER] - Jeez. Again. - [LAUGHS] - How times have changed. When a lot of us went to school here, everything was football, right? We thought it would be that way forever. We even had a plan to build a big, gleaming new stadium for our boys. We had to put that dream on hold. We were struggling. All right? Like so many American towns... felt left behind. But no more. Tonight, friends... tonight, we witnessed a transformation. We saw how good our girls could be. We saw that they could take the lead. Right? These girls right here! Who run the world? Who run the w... girls! G... girls. You've seen the T-shirt. Come on, you guys. [LAUGHS] Leaving me hanging up here. Now, listen. Some people say cheer is not a sport. I think Coach French over here would disagree, but I can tell you this: it is a business. It's an industry. It's the future. And it is a future that is coming here to Sutton Grove. - Let's hear it! Come on! - [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] Let's hear it! Folks, a stadium can transform a town. A stadium can heal a town.
