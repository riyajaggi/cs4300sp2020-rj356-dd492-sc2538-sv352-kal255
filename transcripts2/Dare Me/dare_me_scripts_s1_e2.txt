 - Previously on "Dare Me"... - Colette French? Some fancy new coach from across the state thinks she can come and run my squad? - What do I see? Spray tans. Gummy bear thighs. Backyard tumblers. I don't see a squad. And I do not see my top girl. - I'm the captain. - We're not doing captains anymore. - No, I'm captain. This is my squad. - Wrong.

 You're not like the others. You know that, don't you? - He's back. - Sarge Will. - Wonder what he did all summer. What the hell, B? - Beth, put the fucking gun down! Beth, come on. Just you and me, like the old days. Beth! - Do you know what desire is? Mutually assured destruction. Coach told me that once. You know each other's secrets. You've laid yourself bare.

 You both have everything to lose. - Hurry up. It's time. - You all look rode hard and put up wet, like maybe you were up to no good last night. Okay, stop. Go home. Sleep it off. You two, my office. What you saw last night was a mistake. It's not gonna happen again. So I would appreciate it if you could keep it to yourselves. I don't interfere in your personal lives, and...I hope I can expect the same from you. The squad needs to have each other's back. Are we good? - Sure, Coach. We good. Squad deep. I mean, even if we did want to tell... - Which we don't. - Look at you-- wife, mother, star coach. Who would ever believe anything so lurid, especially from a pair of teenage girls? I mean, not even teenage girls believe teenage girls. - That's not what this is about. - We know. - We do. It's about the squad, just like you say. Support your girl. Stay tight. Legs together. Lock your knees. - Don't worry, Coach. We got your back. "We got your back, Coach." Boy, one eyeful of her rosy tits, and it's like you're hypnotized. I was right, you know. - Right...? - She is a liar... and a cheater, and an appallingly bad one. - And since when are you the morality police? You were firing off rounds last night like Tony Montana. It was hot. - People are already talking. - They better be. - Not everything is a game. - But it could be. We play our cards right, we may never have to do another bleacher sprint. Yeah, or make it to regionals. Seriously, you care that much about her personal life? - I care about a lot of things. - Yeah, till you don't anymore... till you get bored. - There's nothing boring about lusty Coach's warped fetish for the wounded warrior. It's just a shame that we don't have it in living color. - Beth... last night, you didn't. - How could I? You knocked my phone out of my hand like it was a goddamn grenade. And you know the rules-- pics, or it didn't happen. - Good. Then it didn't happen. - If you say so. - I'm handling it. It's fine. They're my girls. I don't know. You didn't see what I saw at the party. - They're wild. All girls that age are wild. They don't know anything yet. It's easy. - But you weren't like that. You were, um, so serious. - You used to come into the Esso and get your bike tires filled. You-- you had old eyes. - Is that supposed to be a compliment? - Well, your eyes are younger now. I should have never taken you up there. - Yeah, well, I shouldn't have gone. - So this is that kind of talk? Cool it before anybody gets hurt, straighten up and fly right? - I have a lot of eyes on me, a lot of people watching, all these expectations. I can't take any more chances right now. Chest up. Eyes up. Everything tight. - That's how it's done. - It is. And now we will do it again... with Tacy. You heard me. Elevator her up. - Why? If Beth's the better top girl, aren't we just wasting time? - Listen up, all of you. Getting to regionals isn't about one girl. It's about one squad, regardless of who's on top. - Coach is right. You remember what she said. Top girl is a girl that can control herself. And last Friday night, I didn't see a lot of self-control. - Self-control's just the beginning. What I need to see is hard work, sacrifice, trust. If we can't count on each other, we fail. If we can't trust, we lose. Now let's go. Hey. - Hey. You survived. - Yeah. Booster moms, with J. J. Curtis leading the assault. - Bert swore if I had just one drink with them... Can you get PTSD from happy hour? - Well, having survived a J. J. ambush... I never really thanked you. - I didn't buy them to be thanked. - I know why you bought them. And now I want the present that comes after the present. - Best control your little friend, unless you want me to. - Man. Look who's back. Sarge Stud's never been here two weeks in a row before. He must love us. - Cold. - At ease, boys. After everything we shared Friday night. - Okay, everybody. Huddle up. - Tight, clean, perfect. This is Jeff East, my last squad, the bid video that got them into regionals and then all the way to states. - Where they came in fifth. - They wanted it. They worked for it. It happened. And it could be you... now that you've been invited to submit. - What? That's why for the next two weeks, everything that we do in practice is about our video. Forget football games. Forget sideline cheer. The video is the only thing that matters. Okay, let's get started on that tumbling. Hanlon, a word. Not much of a team player, is she? - She wants this. She wants to win. She wants those state rings. - As much as you do? - She'll do what's right for the squad. I'll... talk to her again. - It's not how it looks, Addy. Me and him, it's... It's not like that. - Like, I don't want to be seen with you if you're, like, all bloaty here. - Thirsty. - Look at how big they are. And it's only been, like, two weeks, so I can't wait to see what they're like three weeks-- - Fetus, keep this flyswatter in check. Bitch. - You know, when we make it to regionals, it'll be you up there. - Regionals, regionals, regionals. You know what you should be worried about? That video. - Of course I'm worried about the video. Everyone wants it to be good. - Sorry, I meant the other video, the one we almost got Friday night-- you know, Coach lap-banging Soldier Boy. - Beth. - Which sadly doesn't exist. Like I said-- pics, or it didn't happen. - Beth, stop fucking with me. You don't have that video, right? - Coach is right. Trust is vital. You know, I remember a time way back when when my best girl never doubted me. Of course, if that's changed, check for yourself. You know you want to... Mom. - Forget it. I believe you. Shit. Sh-- HIDERHOLE, HIDERHOLE. - Ew. Hey. - Hey. - Okay, it's not in my car. I checked. Can't you just ask Sugar Daddy Bert to get you a new one? - That's not what sugar daddy means. - She lost her phone. - Lost? - Strange, right? I mean, considering it's never out of my sight. - You lost it the other night. - Did I? Remind me. - You know, I bet it's in the Jeep. Once I found mine melted to my dashboard. It looked like lava. Couldn't even tell it was a phone. - Maybe. Or maybe it went missing before that. - What, like at practice? - Yeah. - Here's an idea-- buy a new one. - Buy a new one, terrorists win. Besides, I think I'm gonna get that phone back. - Here... use mine. - I don't want your phone. - So you're just gonna live without a phone? - No. You are. - I want this timeline to work, too, but the permits-- - You worry too much. It gives you wrinkles. We got this. There she is. Sweetie, this is-- this is Mr. Coach himself, Matt French. - Coach isn't married. - Sure is. Four years and counting. - Wow. Um, she just doesn't-- she doesn't give off a big wife vibe. She seems so... free. Well, I should get going. - Hey. - Thanks. - So that's how you got her here. - Well, remember, sweet peach, I got her here for you. Hey. How you doing on gas money? Or-- or you know what? Better yet. Spankin'- new coach means you should have spankin'- new cheer shoes, am I right? Here. - More. More. Someone stole my phone. - Wow, surrounded by thieves and traitors. I get it. Listen, Elizabeth Ann... I love you. You know that. - You're always shooting for that "number one dad" mug, aren't you? - And I'm sorry about Friday. Your mother-- - Let me guess. It was a mistake. It'll never happen again. - Hey, that's a promise, angel face. [Leikeli47's "Money"] - Told you. I knew he'd pay up. You have many talents. - You sure you don't mind closing? - I mind. Just don't come back with a shaved head. - It's just talking, just getting some tips. Sergeant Will used to play back in the day. - I know. He told me. - He recruiting you, too? - No. He gave us a ride Friday night. - Shit. Home from Lanvers? I heard Beth was in fine form, making moves like a gangsta. - No comment. - She's the one they should recruit. - Hey, you. - Hey. - So, if you were to sign up... and I'm not saying you should... it'd be a hell of a lot easier than what you're doing now-- practice before school, lifting, conditioning. I mean, you've already got the self-discipline. Hell of a lot more than I had when I was your age. - You played quarterback? - No. No, I played fullback. I wasn't really that good, but I loved it. Dislocated my shoulder, knocked three of my front teeth out. The pain was all worth it, you know? It always is. It's like we say on the T-shirt... "Pain is fear leaving the body." - Always stumping for the Marines? The Corp got me out of my old man's house, showed me the world, gave me structure. But I didn't have your arm, so I get it. You don't want to let that go. At your age, there's gonna be a lot of things that you want... and you've got to try to get them. You'll regret it if you don't. - Hey, so I know it's late, but I think I'm actually gonna drive over to Sterling Heights and cosign that lease for my mom. I don't want her calling again. She's easier in the evenings after she's had that third Kahlua and cream. She still, living with that guy, that bail bondsman? What's his name? - Izzy. Yeah, they're all named Izzy. But if I get it over with... - She drives you crazy. You really want to do that to yourself? Just stay here with us. - I'd love to, but if I don't go see her... - She'll come see us. - Yep. - Sold. [The Raveonettes' "Wine"] - Really? It's gonna take that long? Dude says, like, 30 minutes for takeout. It's insane. This is boring. I'm bored. - You want to stomp it out? - Phone. You, film this. - Lock up your sons! - Lock up your boys. Lock up your sons. Lock up your boys. - Mom and Dad. Lock up your sons. Lock up your boys, Mom and Dad. Lock up your sons. Lock up your boys, Mom and Dad. Ready? Let's stomp. Stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp it out. Stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp it out. Stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp it out. Lock up your chastity belt. We're coming for you. We're gonna stomp it out. Lock up your chastity belt. We're coming for you. We're gonna stomp it out. Lock up your chastity belt. We're coming for you. We're gonna stomp it out. - HIDERHOLE. HIDERHOLE. - Whatever Beth Cassidy has on you, she probably already uploaded it somewhere. - You don't get it. That's not how we work. What is it? I need to see. Lock up your chastity belts. We're coming for you. We're gonna stomp it out. Lock up your chastity belt. We're coming for you. We're gonna stomp it out. - Wait, Hanlon? She knows you have her phone? - See? This is how we work. [Bali Baby's "Professor Finessor" playing] - So you're Sarge Stud's new lapdog? - The Sergeant needed some help with all you wild things. - Right. Well, hell, why don't you invite him over? - Not gonna happen, pretty girl. Why so interested in the Boy Scout? - Maybe I have some classified information about him. - Yeah? What's that? Not such a Boy Scout. Maybe not, but he's still not gonna play with you, and I thought you were here to play, at least till your mama comes home. Or wakes up. - Still nothing? - You, want my help with the trash? - The trash. The trash! - Shit, yeah! - Beth, you unbearable tease. [Magic Island's "Like Water"] - Thanks, Sarge. - Of course. Have a good night. - You too. We meet again. Hey, look, your friend from the other night, she's okay, right? - Yeah. That's just a Friday night for Beth. - You know, Colette and I-- Coach French, I don't know if she told you, but we go way back. - Um...no. She didn't. - Yeah, our paths used to cross all the time in high school. They kept crossing. - You went to school together? - Same parties. I remember one time, we ended up out at Rattlesnake Point. Cops came. We all piled in my cousin's car, and... somehow, she wound up on my lap. She was so shy, maybe even, regal, if that makes sense. But she wasn't like anyone else. So, when I saw her a few months later standing under one of those glittery balls at some dance, I wasn't gonna miss my chance twice. - I mean, what happened? You guys didn't end up together. - She had places she wanted to go. So did I. I guess it's like my old man used to say-- "The past is never where you left it." Would you do me a favor? I always liked her hair down. But... - Yeah. - Thank you. - Tell me that was a Jehovah Witness. - He's just a recruiter from school. He was here for Slocum. - Hey. - Hey. - You have fun with RiRi last night? - Just as it was starting to get interesting, J.J. pulled the plug. - Well, I've got some good news. Here. You wouldn't believe where I found it. - Your panties? - Locker room. It must have slipped between the towels. - Did you look inside? - Why would I do that? - Don't you want to peer into the secrets of my black old heart? - I guess I already know all your secrets. - Don't be so sure. - Hey. - Hi. Um, Mr. French? - Matt. You're-- You're one of Colette's mighty band of warriors? - Yeah, Addy. Um, I was just-- - Yeah, I-I'm late for a work thing, but go on in. Okay. - Hey, what are you doing? Come in. Come in. Glamorous, right? Some day all this can be yours. She must have had a bad dream. - She's beautiful. - She is. She really is. Go on. - This is my favorite room. - When I was a kid, I used to always have to share a room with my brother. Then the day I got my first period, my mom hung a sheet up in the middle of the room. The wall of privacy was what she called that. All I ever wanted was my own room. - And now you have it. - It's important to make things happen for yourself, Addy. Don't wait for things. Make them yours. - I will. There are a lot of things that I want. - Every morning, I put all of these little pillows back on the bed. And every night... Italian. 1,200 thread count. You should feel it on your skin. Sit. - Come on, touch it. I almost forgot. - Where did you-- - He gave it to me. Sarge Will. - You saw Will? - Yeah. He said things about you, about how you were. The way he talked about you... Must be something-- someone wanting you like that. You should go to him. - What? No-- no. Look, I know that you think that this is easy, but it-- it's not. I... I can't. - Don't miss your chance twice. - Addy... - Go. I'll stay here, okay? I'll watch your kid. - We could have moved, you know? At any point. - And let them win? Never. [IDLES' "Colossus"] - It's strange to look back, to see the person you thought you were. - There were things I did, bad things. I'd like to say I had to... that I had no choice. - But we always have a choice... and those choices can lead us to dark places. - The truth is, it was like I was living for the first time. And once you feel that, you'll do anything to keep feeling it. - Anything.
