 It's like turning over a rock and all these ugly things wriggle out. How come you never choose me? What does she have that I don't? - She isn't you. - I fell into a dream. A beautiful dream. I didn't wanna leave the dream. Addy, where is you Hamsa? - You're stumbling, Addy. - It's bad, Addy. - Addy. Addy. Hey.

 - You better be wearing your Hamsa today, 'cause shit is going down. What? My Hamsa? - Guess what I'm doing. Reading the actual newspaper. I thought the old lady would faint. "Do you even know what that is, darling daughter?" The morning wit in the Cassidy household. - What's it say? - "A police source reported growing suspicions "after autopsy results raised questions "about the gun's trajectory. "One source also indicated gunshot residue tests on the victim's hands showed only trace amounts." Fuck me, Hanlon. You wait your whole life for something to happen, and then, suddenly it does. I never wanted to hurt him-- to hurt Matt. We-- we didn't text, we didn't talk. We used this app. The messages weren't stored. Now that he's gone, there's nothing left, Addy. There's nothing that connects us. - What if someone was there before we were? - We would've known. We would've been able to tell. - The cops can tell. My mom said they've been looking at everything. - Your mom... she's working on the case? - Everyone is. It's a big deal. Coach, it's getting bigger every day. What if they find out about us? We could just tell them. Finding a body's not a crime. - Is that what you want, Addy? Sitting in an interrogation room... telling a cop what you saw... What you did? And then telling your mom? I won't let you go through that. I won't. I know how hard this is. Hey, it is hard for me, too. I can't get it out of my head, any of it. - No, tell him double if he'll rush it. Well, now that Sutton Grove's finest is done, we gotta just throw some bleach in there and get that baby rented out again. And get the locksmith in there, too. We gotta fix that door before the ghouls start lurking. Beth Ann. The prodigal-- or maybe I'm the prodigal after my shameful conduct at that restaurant in Cleveland. - Skip it. It's water under the slowly sinking bridge. But if we were to say, quantify it, how broken up are you, Pops? I don't know. I did the crimes, I'll do the time. Champ, you wanna catch a second breakfast with the old man? The place in the lobby has really upped their game. You'll have to pay. I'm a little light. - I'm good. I got everything I need. - You let me know if you don't. Hey, last game tomorrow night. I'll be there, of course. Can you believe we're-- we're finally here? - I can. Beth Ann, I-- I, I see it, you know? I see it, and it takes my breath away-- how good you've gotten. She made you tougher. She make you stronger. - She didn't. I did. Sorry, I-- I'm on the wrong floor. - Aren't we all, honey? It's easy to get lost, isn't it? I knew it wasn't suicide. Didn't get into it with the cops. I hate cops. Wanna hear my theory? - Absolutely. - Serial killer. Huntin' down Marines. Everyone's political these days. - There's only one Marine, though. - No. There was always the other one, hulking around. Spooky looking one. Big guy, darty eyes. Reminded me of my ex. Well, before he got hauled off for three to seven in Chillicothe. - Well, if there was a serial killer targeting Marines, sounds like he'd be one well worth taking out. Crime of passion's a much more plausible theory. If you believe what you hear about that girlfriend. - The blonde? Sure. - She around much? - I mind my business. We all take our comforts as we may. Pretty, though. But twitchy. Always in a rush. - You seen her lately? Like...maybe the night he shuffled off this mortal coil? - Look at you, Sam Spade. No, I haven't seen her in a while. She always looked too high hat for this joint Figured she had her fun and moved on. Didn't I see you here before? - No. You must have me confused with someone else. No. - Morning, miss. I guess somebody's parents complained. They think it's morbid. You know, now that he was murdered. - But we don't really know, do we? - Well, tell that to them. - Cops. - Yeah. Actual, real detectives. I wonder who's next. - Colette French? - Yes. - We're hoping you might be able to answer a few questions. - Of course. I'm sorry it's such a mess. I am usually much more organized than this. - Miss French, we tried to reach you over the phone. - You-- you did? I-- that can't be. I didn't-- - Your home phone. - The landline. We don't-- - That's the only number that we had under your registration. Florida plates. Are you just passing through town, Miss French? - No. Look, what-- what is this about? - It's about the other night. - Your little misadventure. - I don't know what you mean. - You seem a little nervous. You thought you'd gotten away with it? A week ago, Tuesday. Last Tuesday? Cameras caught everything. They always do. - I don't understand-- Matt. - You the husband? - Yeah, I'm the husband who wants to know what you're doing here with my wife. - Your wife ran into a light pole on Revere, by the liquor store. Took a bite out of it. - Cameras caught it. License plate and all. That's a misdemeanor. Evading responsibility. You know what those light poles cost taxpayers? - I'll pay for it. I-- I will pay for everything. Well, thank you, officers. I'm sorry. I swear, I didn't think I'd done any damage. - 'Cause you never bothered to look back. Let that be a lesson to you, Miss. There are cameras everywhere. - I-- I promise I learned my lesson. - And it's the funniest thing, that, CCTV footage, it looked for all the world like you drove into that light pole on purpose, like nothing could stop you. Well, you have a nice evening. Both of you. - I'm gonna need a minute. [E-Cig's "Cut Your Bangs"] - Don't tell me you still have that box. Bert and his cigars. What would Freud say? Cuban by way of Tijuana. Remember that smell? - Slave labor and Bain de Soleil? We gotta hang that up down here. Along with the heads of your victims. - Don't think there's room. - It was so great seeing you out there, Bethie. Seeing you up on top, where you belong. That coach of yours, she's doing something right. - That's what everyone seems to think. - You don't like her. - Don't trust her. - That tracks. That tracks. - What do you mean? - Did I tell you I saw her once? About a week or two ago, before I knew who she was. Pretty blonde, standing outside a convenience store. Couldn't even light her own cigarette. Her hands were shaking so bad. I played Sir Galahad. - Good Samaritan. I wanted to help her out. She reminded me of someone I once knew. Someone so beautiful and so hungry that she thought she should get everything she wanted. People like that are dangerous. - Dangerous? - Because... the beauty goes away, but the hunger only grows and nobody gets everything they want. You gotta decide what's worth keeping... and what's worth trading. [Pisces' "Dear One"] - Listen, I'm really sorry I can't make the game tonight. - It's okay. I get it. - It's just-- we're all pulling double shifts now, with everything. - Yeah. Bye. - How is it possible that we've never actually met? - Well, it sure feels like we already have. I mean, Addy talks about you all the time. You've had a big impact on her. - I'm-- I'm glad. You know, she's so talented. So disciplined. Few girls her age have that. She must get it from you. - Maybe. Though I've never been past the county limits, and Addy is just itching to get out there in that big, bad world. - You're worried about her. I get that. But I guess that there's trouble everywhere. God, I mean, look what happened to that recruiter right here in Sutton Grove. - I'm aware. - This is the first place that I've been that had recruiters stationed right in the school. There was something unnerving about it. I mean, the one who died, he seemed okay, but the other one... I-- I think his name was Kurtz... I didn't like what I saw. - What did you see? - Attentions. To my girls. I told them to keep their distance. I hope they did, but... I heard things. - Is that right? - I look out for my girls. That age, all that beauty, all that longing... It is so easy to find yourself in dark places. - I'm surprised you wanted to talk to me. - I don't. Ever. So cut to the chase. I know your dirty little secret. You've been squatting at The Towers, haven't you? In that model apartment. Across from Sarge Will's. You don't really live there. - Who cares? That building's a ghost town. - Well, one more ghost now. So you're gonna tell me everything you heard that night. The night Sarge Will bit it. - I didn't hear a goddamn thing. - No, those walls are paper thin. You said so yourself. So thin, you couldn't take me there... 'Cause the neighbors might hear me scream. Well, it turns out no one did, that night at the Playland. We teenage girls and our selfies. - Look, I-- I can-- I-- I was drunk. I-- I didn't-- I don't know-- I-- I didn't. - You did. So either you start talking... Or I do. And I won't ever stop. - Look who's joining the party. - What's going on? - Corporal Kurtz here shares my opinion of our esteemed coach. Tell her. Tell her what you just told me. She needs to start facing some hard truths. Everything in life can't always be clean and pretty. Go ahead, spill. I'd heard them before, even saw her a few times. Once by the elevators, looking through the peephole. Sunday night, I was coming home around 11. Walked down that long hall-- that's how I could hear them inside. Something didn't sound right. It was mostly shouting. A lot...of shouting. I thought something may be up. He sounded...ragged. But then it was just like it usually was. Headboard banging like a jackhammer. Fuck. I left. To be honest, I-- the two of them, it made me sad. I mean, it was a fucked up situation. You could tell that something bad was gonna happen. Things running that hot-- I'm not saying that she did something to him-- - You are. - Well, he's obviously lying. - No, I'm not. And I'm not saying she-- I just didn't like it. Hearing them. I bailed, made my way to a bar down the road before any gunshot. I-- I had my problems with the Sarge. A lot of 'em. But he didn't deserve to go out like that. He was all caught up in her. And-- and she-- - We know what she's like. The effect she can have on people. - Is this over? - It's over. It's over for you. Get out. - What the hell's wrong with you? Why are you talking to him? - Wake up, Addy. You can lie to everyone else, but you can't lie to me. Truth will out. [Robotanists' "Warpath"] [Sleater-Kinney's "Surface Envy"] Eagles! Eagles! Eagles! - Let's go, Eagles! - Direct your attention to midfield for the coin toss. - This is such bullshit. The crowd's here to see us not them - I need to talk to you. - Now is not a good time. - Coin toss goes to Sutton Grove. But before we begin tonight, many of the students here knew Sergeant William H. Mosley as a mentor, a friend. And we want to mark his passing tonight. One of his trusted men, PFC James Tibbs, will lead us in a moment of silence. - Sergeant Mosley... You will not be forgotten. You will not be forgotten! - Thank you, and good luck tonight, Sutton Grove. - Kurtz is saying things about you. Stuff that doesn't make sense to me. - You're gonna listen to Kurtz? I told you, I have this under control. Okay? - You keep saying that. But Coach, you called me that night. And you brought me into this horrible thing, and you owe me the truth. - You know the truth. I know what's happening here. This is Beth. She has you brainwashed, and she always has. You need to grow up and cut her loose. It's time, Addy. Okay! Attack, attack that quarterback. Knock him flat, right on his back. Attack, attack that quarterback. Knock him flat, right on his back. Ready? Okay! Attack, attack that quarterback. - Ready! - Knock him flat, right on his back. - Down! 25's a Mike! 25's a Mike! - Read, set, hike! Touchdown! - Yes! - Yes! - Let's go! - I don't wanna jinx it, but I think there's a chance we could actually win this game. I forgot, did you play in high school? - No, no. Tennis team. - Well, there's a little insight into Matt French's past, right? Non-stop! We're taking it to the top. - Prep school, locked jaw, gin and tonics. Am I right? Class act. Speaking of class acts, there's our rainmaker, our power broker. Play nice. - Just a mom today. All right. Non-stop! We're takin' it to the top! - You'll see. That'll be your baby girl down there before you know it. Never knew I had so many feelings until I had them. We're takin' it to the top! Non-stop! - One minute, it's all about you. Your career, your dreams, your ambitions. And then suddenly, they're there. And you'd do anything for them, to protect them. - The things we do for them. To make up for the things we do to them. - Okay, squad. Who's ready? Dead Man's Fall. The quick and dirty one. Guns out, bitches. - We're taking the field? - Next jump-out. - But Coach-- - Yeah, shouldn't we ask her? - You wanna ask Coach if she can help us with our Dead Man? - Timeout, Bobcats. - That's our cue. You ready, Addy? Sure hope you catch me when I fall. Guns up till sunup! Gotta get our guns up! Guns up till sunup! Ain't nobody gonna fuck with us! Guns up till sunup! Gonna get our guns up! Ain't nobody gonna stop us! Guns up till sunup! Gotta get our guns up! Ain't nobody gonna stop us! Eyes on your girl. - Sutton Grove, coming back strong after that time out. Hey, hey, hey, hey, What's the holdup? Kurtz? - And that's the game, folks. Eagles for the win. - Addy. Addy. - Stop. - Addy-- - I said stop, Beth. - Addy, where is your Hamsa? - What is it with you and this fucking bracelet? - Wait, you mean the bracelet that I gave to you and that you gave to her? - I didn't. - Your lies, Addy, you can't even keep track of them. Addy, wake the fuck up, please. You were there. Somehow, Addy, somehow you were there. - No, I wasn't. You don't know everything. Okay? And you don't control me. - No, I know just who controls you. - I control me. And you need to stop this. You have to stop this for me. - This is for you, okay? You think that she's gonna protect you, she won't. She does whatever she wants and she takes and she takes, and she-- - That's you, Beth! That's you. You take. - Is that what you think? Is that what you actually think? - Yeah. - Well, I guess we'll see, won't we? We'll see if she's worth it. If she's got your back like I always had. Eyes on my girl, Addy. We'll see what she says when the detectives ask about the bracelet. Your bracelet. The one that they found at the crime scene. - What? What did you just say? That's not true. That's not true. - Addy. - And even if it was, how would you know that? How could you possibly fucking know that, Beth? - We won! - This is insane! - Yeah, it is. - There's gonna be a rager at Lanvers, partying over the abyss. - The abyss. The abyss. C'est moi. Let's go, my band of bitches. Whoo! [Savages' "Adore"] - The heart can take you all kinds of places. Beautiful places. Haunted places. Places of risk and pain. - But the heart can also deceive you. - That's something I learned the hard way. - What is it? What are you looking for? - The Hamsa bracelet. - That red thing? - The one that Addy gave me. - So what? - I have to find it. - Why? - Because I might have left it behind at his place. When we were there. - My God. - Don't trust your heart. Don't trust anyone. - Stay strong. Seal up all your feelings. - Fight to the end.
