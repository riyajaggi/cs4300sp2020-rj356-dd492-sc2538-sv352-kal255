 Previously on "Dare Me." For the next two weeks, everything that we do in practice is about our video. We're not there yet, but we're close. I can see it and I can see regionals. - You want the dick. - Not into your dick. Show me what else you got. - I hear everything. Don't you know that by now, Hanlon? - It just feels so good to be free. - You know what I want? A wife who cares enough

 to remember to pick up our daughter. - Playland motel. Friday night. - The marines? This is their party? - The party's over. Come on. - Beth? - She's down there. - You cannot bring her here. Not tonight. I thought you were smarter than this. - I used to think that memories were a way of holding onto the truth. Never forgetting what really happened. But it turns out memories are more like dreams. They tell us everything about ourselves, whether we're ready for it or not. - Well, Matt's gonna wake up soon, so...

 - Hey. - How you feeling? - Get your stuff. We're leaving. - Everything okay? - Meet me later in my office, Addy. - What were you and Coach talking about? - Nothing. Girlfriend's just pissed you brought me there last night. So am I. That was the last place you should've taken me. - I had no choice. - You could've taken me to your house. My house? My mom would've freaked out. You were gone, Beth. Completely gone. Worse than the night at Lanvers. - Unbelievable. - Well, sorry. I guess I fucked up, okay? I just...I didn't know what to do, Beth. I...I thought we needed help. - What? - I thought you might need help. - Not from her. Never from her. - Get in here. Close the door. - But it's Saturday. No one's here. - Do you understand what almost happened last night? - Yes. - Cheerleaders arrested in motel party with marines. That's not the headline we want when we're waiting to hear about regionals. I trusted you. I made you a leader, I saw it in you, and I wanted to make it happen for you. We are so close to being the squad that we want to be right now. We are unified, even Beth. And then you pull this. - We are unified. Beth, all of us. We just wanted to let loose. Coach, we have been working so hard. No one knows anything. It's not a thing, I swear. - No? Are you sure about that? 'Cause you girls live your lives on your Goddamn phones. There must be photos, right? - No photos. They took our phones. - What? If this gets out... To Beth's dad, the other boosters, that is like shining a spotlight on me and everything that I do. I can't afford that right now. I can't take any more risks. I thought you understood that. I thought you had my back. - Nothing happened. We were out of there before the cops came. And no one's gonna talk. - Okay, not even Beth? - Especially Beth. Beth never talks about anything. Not even to me. - You should go now. - Watch this. Boo! Bitch. It's all in the abs, so you better get some. - Yeah, better get some. - I didn't know Beth had her bow and arrow. - Jealous, much? - She doesn't need to show off. The great ones never do. Hey. You're not wearing your necklace. - I lost it, Friday night. - Shit. At the party? I'm sorry. I know how much you love that necklace. - It's just a necklace. - Yeah, but you're always saying it's the only thing your dad ever got you that didn't look like it came from the airport gift shop. - Okay, one last time before the pep rally. Let's get to it. I wanna see those liberties. Get into your groups. ["Up All Night" by Sault] - Wanna dare to carb and get Luigi's? Just sneak one by Coach with a Maestro Maximus deep dish? - Yeah, if I can go for a run after. - Relax. Just take a minute. Who are you always competing with? - We find out about regionals tomorrow. We're almost there. We just... we gotta push even harder. We gotta lock it down. - Like Friday night? Were you locking it down then? - Mom. I- I explained... - Stop that. Drives me nuts. - Sorry. The one night I don't text back. I got distracted. I forgot to look at my phone. I told you I was staying at Beth's. - At Beth's. Don't forget, I've met Beth's mother. A nightgown in the middle of the afternoon. Like Blanche DuBois. When I text you for a check-in, you text back. That's the deal we made. - Okay. I'm sorry. I screwed up. Everyone screws up. I'm sorry. You know how Beth is. - I know. - It's just a lot all the time, so... I just... don't know if it's real. Sometimes I don't know if it's real or if it's just "The Boy Who Cried Wolf." - And you know what happens to that boy, right? When the wolf finally does come, no one believes him. - I didn't mean to... - Fall out, soldier. - Yes, ma'am. - What's his story? - There is no story. - So you and Kurtz aren't... - You shouldn't ask questions that you don't want the answer to. - Why wouldn't I want the answer? - 'Cause you like things simple and pretty, Addy. You always have. - Can you just answer the question? - What was it again? - You and Kurtz? Friday night. Nothing happened... that you didn't want to happen, right? - Nothing happened. - Here we are again, Sutton Grove. Another Homecoming! Take a look at this team right here. These guys are ferocious. Friday night, these guys are going to slaughter the Holy Cross Saints. But I'm burying the lede. We have some big news about our soaring varsity cheer squad. Guys, all they do is work. They are fearsome, they are ferocious, and now they are contenders! That's right. Cleveland, here we come! These girls are going to regionals! - Yeah! You're going to regionals. And you're going to regionals! And you're going to regionals. And you're going to regionals! How 'bout that! Regionals, here we come! Okay, so this year, we go up to Cleveland, the mistake on the lake, but next year, when we get our own new shiny stadium right here in Sutton Grove, they come to us, all right? They come to us! All right, now let's get a little taste of the sweet, sweet nectar to come. Coach French, take it away. Show us what winners look like! Take it away, girls. Let's hear it for our girls. - Okay. You heard the man. You worked hard. You fought for it. Here we are. After this you will eat, sleep, breathe cheer every day until we get to regionals. But first... get out there and take your victory lap. Go! - One, two, three! Go Eagles! - We're going to regionals! Let's go, Eagles! - Hey! S- G-H-S! Eagle up! Hey. Eagle up. Hey. Eagles, you know what to do. Get out of your seats and Eagle up, too. - Tacy, are you okay? - My God, Ri. - All right, I need you to just stay strong. You're gonna be okay. Hey, look at me. - You see that? - What the hell? - Sorry. - Slow down. - Sorry, I have the teeth. - You can't go back there! I said you-- - Sorry. - Yes, we have them, we must. - Hi, I have them. I lost a tooth when I was in the sixth grade and my mom-- she knew that milk keeps the teeth alive. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Rinse with saline, no antiseptic. - You're gonna be okay. - Good, good, yeah. Good. - There's my baby. - Hey. - Hey. - Hey. - You okay? You ready to go? - Yeah, I guess. You wanna come? You guys could have a little sleepover tonight, just like the old days. - No, I think I'm gonna stay here. - You sure? Because I am cooking tonight and you're the only one who has ever liked my saucy pork chops. Come on, you guys could haul out that old ouija board. - I thought you threw that thing away 'cause of the-- the bad mojo. - No, it's in the garage. Y'all used to be on that thing all night looking for portents or whatever. - You remember that, right? - Yeah. Yeah, I remember everything. - You're gonna need this. It's not as bad as it smells. - I'll take your word for it. - How are you feeling? - Great. Like I just snorted a line of cocaine and have a bag of "Fuck you" money stashed in a private jet. - Before you come down from that high, do you wanna tell me what happened last night? - Nothing happened. - Look, we all make mistakes. Partying too hard, losing control. And then we learn the hard way not to. If you stay strong and stay clear, then you won't find yourself in a situation that you can't handle. You won't be knocking on people's doors in the middle of the night asking for them to help you. - I don't recall knocking on any doors. - Right, you don't recall. You're okay, right? - I was drunk, but I'm fine, okay? - Okay. Well, Matt's gonna be up soon and I-- - Hey, how are you feeling? - Get your stuff. We're leaving. - Is everything okay? - Meet me later in my office, Addy. - They gone? - Just now. Thank God, right? - Jesus, they look so young. And innocent. Trust me, they're not. - Guess they don't know how lucky they are, do they? Getting caught probably would've been better for them. - Better how? - Teach 'em a lesson. They think they can do whatever they want. They think they can get away with anything. - No one's gonna talk. - Okay, not even Beth? - Especially not Beth. - You should go now. Okay, one more time before the pep rally. Let's get to it. I want to see those liberties. Get into your groups. What is it, Tacy? - I was thinking...what if I tried the bow and arrow today? - Absolutely not. - But I-I've been practicing. - I said no. We don't take risks at a pep rally and you barely have your liberty. Now, get in there. Eyes up, toes pointed, and lock that knee. And up. Three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. - I see Matt took my advice. Although I recall saying two dozen, minimum. I keep a standing order. It solves any problem-- well, most of them. Not that you two have any problems. I'll be sending my own, of course, when we get to regionals. - One-track mind? - Any word, by the way? It would be awfully nice if we had a juicy announcement for the pep rally tomorrow, right? Great optics paper over the slow motion tragedy of our football team. Get my fellow boosters to empty their pocketbooks. - Yeah, go ahead and tell 'em. - No. You heard from them? - Just today. We're in. Fuck me. Pardon-- pardon my French. We're in! That is... gonna be a moment when we announce... You did it. You really did. You got us there. Thank you. - We need to talk. - Look, I know I didn't text you back... - The motel party Friday night. Does that sound familiar? - Yes. - Yeah, your girl Beth and one of my men, Kurtz, have been texting and meeting up. I don't know how far it went, but... - Jesus. - I just-- I thought you should know. Okay, he said that she's been icing him out since Friday. I don't know everything for sure, but... I know that Kurtz is a screw up and Beth is... Well, we-- we know how Beth is. - She's wild, right? I mean, you've seen those little skirts that she wears. What did she think was gonna happen? Doesn't she know the rules? Get in a car with an older guy, you stay too long at the Beta-Xi party. God, you fucked his friend? Didn't you know that means you fuck him, too? - That's-- that's not what I meant. That's not what I meant at all. I meant that she's a kid and she doesn't know that she's a kid. That's all I meant. - God. There's so many dangers out there. I don't... - You're doing what you can, okay? They look up to you. And it matters. You can talk to me, you know. - You have to go. I don't wanna get caught. Not again. We might not get as lucky next time. - Colette... - I'll reach out. - Okay. If she says anything, let me know and I'll take care of it. Eagle up. Hey. Eagle up. Hey. Eagles, you know what to do. Get out of your seats and Eagle up, too. Five, six, seven, eight. Tacy. Tacy, get that foot down! - Call 911. Ice, first aid. Okay, hey. Look at me. Breathe. Hey, hey, look at me. You're gonna be okay. Okay, it doesn't hurt as much as you think it does. I need you to stay strong, RiRi. Look at me. Ready? Breathe. Shh. You almost made it. Yeah. Just keep breathing. You're doing so good, okay? Mom? Where's my mom? - Your mom-- I called your mom. She's on her way, remember? No, no. She's not gonna be mad. Take a breath, okay? Just take a breath. Yeah, that's good. Will you hold this? Good, okay. You're okay. Hey, you're okay, you're okay. - Okay, I'm gonna need you to open your mouth and keep it open. - Okay, ready? - Okay. - You're okay. Shh, it's okay. - Very clean extraction. They might be able to replant. Do we have the teeth? - Um...yes. - Where are they? - We must-- we have them. - I have the teeth. - You can't go back there! - I have them. - Thank you. - Okay, rinse with saline, no antiseptic. - Milk keeps the teeth alive. - We're gonna have to watch her for a concussion. At least football players wear helmets. - There's my baby. - You're the mom? - Yes, yes. I'm here now, baby. - Okay, Mom, we're gonna need you to step out. - I'm right here, baby. I'm not going anywhere. - She's gonna be okay. Um... Is...um...is there anyone that I can call, anything that I can do for you? - You can do your fucking job and maybe we wouldn't be here. - You...have to know how sorry I am. - You are a mother, right? This is on you. Her face... ruined because of you. Because you wanted to do what you wanted to do. You are the coach. The adult. The mother. This is on you. - Complete collapse? Maybe we should take the hint. - End the longest day ever? Thank you for picking her up today. - It's no problem. - Should I ask about the princess Band-Aid? - It's just a scratch. It's nothing to worry about. She's tough. Like her mom. - You're okay, right? - Yeah, I was-- just drunk. I'm fine, okay? - Okay. Well, Matt's gonna be up soon, so-- - Hey, how are you feeling? - Get your stuff. We're leaving. - What did you and Coach talk about? - Nothing. Girlfriend's just pissed you brought me there last night. So am I. That was the last place you should've taken me. - I had no choice. - You could've taken me to my house. You could've taken me to your house. You could've-- could've taken me to a bus stop or left me on the church steps in a box or in a Goddamn gutter, okay? Anything would've been better. - You were completely out of it. Do you not remember? You know how you get. There's no dealing with you when you're like that. - Unbelievable. - I guess I fucked up again, right? I'm sorry. Is that what you want to hear? I'm the asshole because... I thought we needed help. - What? - You needed help. - Not from her. Never from her. - Your phone's buzzing. Can I use that now? If you're done. - Be my guest. You need it more than I do. - Are you trying to break Dad's heart? - What? - Your necklace. The one that Dad gave you. Did you lose it? No wonder he doesn't get you nice things. - Hey. - Did you find it? - It's not there. No one's seen it. - Okay, thanks. - Is it, like, important? Like, really expensive or something? - I have to go. - Hey, look. Can we-- can we talk about Friday? - I don't need to talk about Friday. - Honestly, the whole night's a wash. - You're gonna have to live with what you don't remember. - Why are you acting so weird? - I'm not. - You need to relax. - No, I don't-- I don't need to do anything. - I didn't mean to... - Fall out, soldier. - Yes, ma'am. - What's his story? - There is no story. - So you and Kurtz aren't... - There's no me and Kurtz. - What about Friday? - What about it? - Nothing happened, right? - You shouldn't ask questions that you don't want the answer to. - Why wouldn't I want the answer? - 'Cause you like things simple and...pretty. - Beth, stop playing. Nothing happened Friday night that you didn't want to happen, right? - No. Nothing happened. - And you're going to regionals! And you're going to regionals! And you're going to regionals! - S-G-H-S! Eagle up. Hey. Eagle up. Hey. Eagles, you know what to do. Get out of your seats and Eagle it up, too. - My God. - You're fine. There's nothing wrong with you. You're just a little shaken up. It hurts, it hurts. - You're just a little shaken up. - How's the patient? - What? How's RiRi? - It's bad now, but she'll be fine. It'll be like it never happened. - And how about the rest of you? - Nothing a little bleach won't fix. - I, I found this in my car. I'm guessing it's yours, right? - Yeah, um, my-- my dad gave it to me. - It's pretty. - Mexico. Our last family trip before we... - Hey. - Hey. - You ready to go? - Yeah, I guess. - You wanna come? You guys could have a sleepover tonight, like the old days. - I'm gonna stay here, but thanks. - Come on, are you sure? I'm cooking tonight and you are the only person who has ever liked my saucy pork chops. - 'Cause they're gross. - You two could haul out that ancient Ouija board... - I thought you threw that thing away because of the bad...mojo? - No, it is in the garage. You two used to be up all night on that thing, looking for portents. - You remember that? - Yeah. I remember everything. - Beth always says, "I choose what to look at. I choose what to remember." Beth is my memory. And I'm hers.
