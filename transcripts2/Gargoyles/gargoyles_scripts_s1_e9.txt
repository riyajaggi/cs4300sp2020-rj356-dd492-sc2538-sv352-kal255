 ALL IN ALL, I'D SAY MY STAY HAS BEEN A LEARNING EXPERIENCE. ONE MORE WEEK AND YOU'RE FREE. YOU'VE...NEVER SAID WHAT YOU WANT DONE ABOUT THE GARGOYLES. IT WOULD BE EASY ENOUGH TO DESTROY THEM DURING THE DAY. HMM... I SUPPOSE. BUT IT SEEMS LIKE SUCH A WASTE. STILL I... I CAN'T HAVE THEM UNDERFOOT WHEN I GET HOME. I BELIEVE I HAVE TEN MINUTES LEFT. TAKE ALL THE TIME YOU WANT. I'M HERE WITH A PROPOSITION FOR MR. XANATOS. -I'M LISTENING. -I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE A SMALL INFESTATION. I DON'T RECALL PHONING PEST CONTROL. I'M FAMILIAR WITH THE NATURE OF THESE... PESTS. AND, FOR A PRICE, I'LL TAKE THEM OFF YOUR HANDS. I SEE. HOW WOULD YOU GO ABOUT THIS, MR...? THEY CALL ME... MACBETH. HEY! WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? I'D HATE TO SPOIL THE SURPRISE BY TELLING YOU, MILADY. -I HATE SURPRISES. NOW, WHO ARE YOU? -I'M CALLED MACBETH. LET'S STEP INSIDE AND DISCUSS THIS. YOU PROTECT NO SECRETS, MADAM. I KNOW ALL ABOUT THESE CREATURES. [CRACKLING] ELISA. WHO'S YOUR FRIEND? YOU OK, ELISA? THIS GUY BOTHERING YOU? [GROWLS] [ROARS] I'M HERE TO OFFER AN INVITATION. LEAVE THIS DRAUGHTY CASTLE. BE GUESTS AT MY HOME. I'M AFRAID WE MUST REFUSE. AND I'M AFRAID I MUST INSIST. I'VE NOT STOOPED SO LOW TO ATTACK WHILE YOU SLEPT BUT NOW... I DON'T LIKE YOUR ATTITUDE. I THINK YOU BETTER LEAVE. WOAH! YE-OW! [THUD] [CLINKING] [COUGHING AND CHOKING] [ROARS] [CRIES OF PAIN] URGH! MR. MACBETH, MR. XANATO HIRED YOU TO FUMIGATE HIS CASTLE NOT DESTROY IT. QUITE RIGHT. WE'LL CONTINUE THIS ELSEWHERE. [BEEPING] [GROWLS] [GROANS] [GOLIATH] I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANYMORE. -[ELISA] YOU'RE NOT SAFE HERE. -NO! YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. WE'VE LOST OUR CLAN, OUR WORLD, OUR TIME! THIS CASTLE IS ALL WE HAVE. WE WILL NOT ABANDON IT. WHAT? YOU WILL NEED A CASTLE TO FALL ON YOU? READ MY LIPS. YOU'RE NOT SAFE HERE. WHAT IF THE NEXT FREAK-JOB XANATOS HIRES SHOWS UP WITH A SLEDGEHAMMER AT HIGH NOON? I CAN'T PROTECT YOU DURING DAY. I'M GOING TO FIND THEM. AND YOU TWO STAY HERE AND PROTECT OUR HOME. WHY WON'T HE LISTEN TO ME? IT'S OBVIOUS THAT YOU CAN'T STAY HERE. [BROADWAY] I THINK ELISA'S RIGHT. [HUDSON] WHAT YOU SAY MAKES SENSE, LASS. BUT...GOLIATH IS OUR LEADER. I CANNOT GO AGAINST HIS WISHES. YOUR LOYALTY IS ADMIRABLE. BUT HE TOLD YOU, "PROTECT OUR HOME". AYE. -THAT HE DID. -HUDSON... YOU AND I BOTH KNOW THIS ISN'T YOUR HOME ANYMORE. [WIND HOWLS] [SQUEAKING] WHO IS THIS MACBETH, ANYWAY? UH...THE NAME SOUNDS FAMILIAR. WAIT! I REMEMBER. GOLIATH WAS TALKING ABOUT A PLAY CALLED MACBETH BY SOME NEW WRITER NAMED SHAKESPEARE. UH-HUH. EVER READ IT? NO. MAYBE WE SHOULD. GOLIATH ISN'T GOING TO LIKE THIS. HE DOESN'T HAVE TO LIKE IT. HE JUST HAS TO REALIZE HE HAS NO CHOICE. ELISA'S RIGHT. WE'RE SITTING DORKS HERE. [CHUCKLES] DUCKS, BROADWAY. SITTING DUCKS. COME, WE CAN'T LEAVE THE GRIMORUM IN XANATOS' HANDS. I'M AFRAID I CAN'T ALLOW THIS. THIS BOOK'S THE PROPERTY OF MR. XANATOS. WHO'S GOING TO STOP US? YOU? INDEED. YOU'RE TRESPASSING. ARGH! [SHATTERS] WE'LL BE GOING NOW. [WHIRRING, DRIPPING] OUCH! [SNIFFS] [GROWLS] OUCH! HOW MANY TIMES WILL YOU TRY THAT? UNTIL YOU FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET US OUT. -[SIZZLING] -OUCH! OUCH! HEY, I'M GETTING TIRED OF THIS. DID YOU SEE THE LIGHTS DIM WHEN YOU DID THAT? OH, SORRY, NO, I WAS TOO BUSY WRITHING IN AGONY TO NOTICE. LOOKS LIKE ELECTRIFYING THESE BARS TAKES A LOT OF POWER. HM... MAYBE WE CAN DIVERT ELECTRICITY TO OUR CAGE TO LET BRONX BREAK OUT OF HIS. OK, BUT...HOW? OH...TERRIFIC. GET READY. NOW! ARGH! -GO FOR HELP, BRONX! -GO ON, BRONX. HURRY! -GO FOR HELP, BRONX! -HURRY! ARGH! [ELECTRICITY FIZZES] OH... GO GET HELP, BRONX. [HONKING] [SCREECH OF TIRES, CRASHING] [SCREECH OF TIRES] [SCREAMING] [PANICKED SHOUTING] BRONX! [GROWLS SOFTLY] WHERE ARE LEXINGTON AND BROOKLYN? [BARKS] [POLICE SIRENS] [BARKING] DON'T BOTHER KNOCKING. AFTER ALL, WE'RE OLD FRIENDS. -FIND BROOKLYN AND LEXINGTON. -[BARKS] [GROWLS] -COME AHEAD, THEN. -[GROWLS] SMART BEAST. BUT YOU'LL LOSE ANYWAY. I DEFEATED YOU IN YOUR HOME. YOU THINK I WOULDN'T BE READY FOR YOU IN MY OWN? [ROARS] [THUDDING] BRONX MUST HAVE FOUND GOLIATH. YEAH. [ROARS] [ROARS] HA-HA, HA-HA! [ROARS] [RUBBLE CLATTERS] -IT'S NOT THAT EASY, MONSTER. -WHY DO THIS? DID XANATOS PAY YOU? [LAUGHS] AYE, I ASKED HIM FOR MONEY. IF I'D OFFERED IT FOR FREE, HE'D HAVE BEEN SUSPICIOUS. THEN WHY? WE'VE DONE YOU NO WRONG. IT'S NOT YOU I'M AFTER. YOU'RE JUST A PAWN. I WANT YOUR QUEEN. QUEEN? -WE HAVE NO QUEEN. -NO? WHAT ABOUT DEMONA? -YOU KNOW DEMONA? -[LAUGHS] KNOW HER? [LAUGHS] I NAMED HER! IF I CAPTURE YOU, THE LAST OF YOUR KIND, SHE WILL COME TO FREE YOU. -IT'S HER I WANT. -[LAUGHS] THEN YOU ARE A FOOL. SHE IS OUR ENEMY. SHE WOULDN'T LIFT A TALON TO SAVE US. [SQUEAKS] [PUNCHES THUD] [BARKS] [CRACKLES] -GOOD BOY, BRONX. -LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. [GROWLS] [GROANS] BLAST YOU! [GROWLS] [BROOKLYN] GOLIATH! LET'S GO HOME. GOLIATH! WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? WHY AREN'T YOU GUARDING OUR HOME? [ELISA] -YOU DON'T LIVE THERE ANYMORE. -WHAT? I FOUND YOU A NEW HOME. HOW DARE YOU! I TOLD YOU THAT CASTLE IS OUR HOME. NO, GOLIATH, SHE'S RIGHT! -IT'S SUICIDE TO STAY THERE. -LAD. THEY'RE RIGHT, YOU KNOW. IT'S JUST A PLACE OF STONE AND WOOD. HOME IS MORE THAN THAT, GOLIATH. HOME IS THE SIX OF US. WHEREVER WE CAN BE TOGETHER AND SAFE. -THAT'S OUR HOME. -[GROWLS] [ROARS] COME, GOLIATH. LET'S BE GOING. GIVE ME ONE MINUTE. I'VE A MESSAGE FOR YOUR MASTER. WE'RE LEAVING. BUT WE'LL BE BACK. WE'LL BE BACK TO CLAIM THAT WHICH IS OURS. I'LL DELIVER YOUR MESSAGE. [WIND HOWLS] WELCOME HOME, MR. XANATOS. I'M SORRY TO TELL YOU THE GRIMORUM IS GONE. AS ARE THE GARGOYLES. HOWEVER, I THINK YOU'LL FIND THIS INTERESTING. [CLICK] FASCINATING. THERE'S A NEW PLAYER IN THE GAME. BUT WE'LL WORRY ABOUT THAT LATER. I'M HOME. THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS NOW. UH...I BET I COULD GET THIS THING WORKING AGAIN. -WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO? -[HUDSON] IT'S NOT SO BAD. THERE'S A PLACE RIGHT OVER THERE FOR A TELEVISION. OK, IT'S A FIXER-UPPER. BUT A FEW THROW RUGS, SOME FLOWERS, IT COULD BE HOME. [GOLIATH] YES. AS LONG WE'RE TOGETHER... IT'S HOME. [THEME MUSIC PLAYING]
