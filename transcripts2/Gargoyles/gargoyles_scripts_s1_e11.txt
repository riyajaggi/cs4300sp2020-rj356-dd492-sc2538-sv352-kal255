 WITH THREATS OF GARGOYLES, MY LIEGE. WE WOULD NEVER HARM A CHILD. OH, YOU ARE TOO SENSITIVE. THIS I TAKE IT IS ABOUT THE ARCHMAGE? AYE. I'M NOT SURE BANISHMENT WAS ENOUGH TO END HIS THREAT. HE TRIED TO USE MAGIC TO USURP MY THRONE. LET HIM DARE TO RETURN AND-- [ARCHMAGE] YOU WILL DIE, POMPOUS FOOL! ARCHMAGE. YOU DARE... YOU THOUGHT YOU COULD BANISH ME? I'M NOT SO EASILY DISPOSED OF, PRINCE MALCOLM. FULMINUS, VENITE! WHAT DO YOU WANT, SORCERER? WHY, REVENGE, OF COURSE.

 OH-OH. [EVIL LAUGH] [GASPS] GET AWAY FROM HIM! LEAVE HIM ALONE! [SOBS] [THUNDER RUMBLING] [YAWNS] [GARGOYLE 1] WHAT'S FOR BREAKFAST? [GARGOYLE 2] I WAS THINKING BLINTZES. YOU SEEM INTROSPECTIVE, OLD FRIEND. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? JUST DREAMING OLD DREAMS. [GASPS] DEMONA, FREEZE! YOU'VE JUST BEEN POISONED. IN 24 HOURS, YOU'LL BE DEAD. I HAVE THE ANTIDOTE. TELL GOLIATH I'LL BE AT THE OLD YORK OPERA HOUSE IN THE VILLAGE. CIAO. [SIGHS] LUCKY FOR ME THE DART HIT MY BADGE. WHAT'S DEMONA'S GAME THIS TIME? I DON'T KNOW. WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT. BUT I'M OK. YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO. YOU KNOW IT'S A TRAP. IF HE DOESN'T GO NOW, DEMONA WILL KNOW HER PLAN FAILED. SHE'LL GO AFTER YOU AGAIN. -WE'VE GOT TO STOP HER. -YES, BUT HOW? WE CAN'T LOCK DEMONA UP HERE AND I WILL NOT EVEN DISCUSS THE ALTERNATIVE. YOU'RE OUR LEADER, GOLIATH. AS SUCH, YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL OF THE GARGOYLES. MAYBE... MAYBE I CAN REACH HER. AT LEAST I HAVE TO TRY. I'LL GO WITH YOU. I'VE GOT A FEW THINGS TO SETTLE WITH HER. NO. YOU STAY HERE WITH BRONX AND GUARD THE TOWER. BROADWAY, YOU AND LEXINGTON ESCORT ELISA HOME AND STAY WITH HER UNTIL SUNRISE. SHE'LL BE SAFE FROM DEMONA THEN. HUDSON, YOU COME WITH ME. [THUNDER RUMBLING] PERHAPS YOU SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT THE OTHERS. NO. BROOKLYN IS STILL TOO ANGRY AT DEMONA. I NEED SOMEONE I CAN RELY ON. SHE WAS HERE... WITHIN THE LAST FEW MINUTES. [THUNDER RUMBLING] [SCREECHING] [GROWLING] NO! AAAH! [THUNDER RUMBLING] [SCRAPING] AAH, COME ON. WELL DONE, OLD SOLDIER, BUT YOU'RE PROLONGING THE INEVITABLE. I COULD SAY THE SAME TO YOU, LASS. IT'S NOT THAT LONG TILL SUNRISE WHEN WE'LL ALL CHANGE. AND TOMORROW NIGHT WHEN GOLIATH AWAKENS, HEALED... HE'LL MAKE SHORT WORK OF YOU. [CHUCKLES] YOU WON'T MAKE IT TO SUNRISE. I'M SORRY IT HAD TO END THIS WAY. [HUDSON SCREAMS] DESPERATE MEASURES. [GROANS] GIVE IT UP, OLD ONE. WHY PROLONG GOLIATH'S SUFFERING? -LEAVE ME. -NEVER. THE DAWN WILL HEAL YOU. WE CAN HOLD OUT UNTIL THEN. YOU CAN RUN, BUT YOU CAN'T HIDE. IN FACT... YOU CAN'T EVEN RUN. WELL, WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME? IT IS POISON, MADE VIRULENT BY A MAGICAL SPELL. UNLESS A CURE IS ADMINISTERED, YOU WILL DIE BY SUNRISE. -CAN YOU CURE ME? -UM... PERHAPS. IF I HAD THE GRIMORUM ARCANORUM. THE ANTIDOTE IS GIVEN ONLY IN ITS PAGES. YOU CAUSED THIS! [WEAKLY] TAKE HER BACK TO HER BED. WE KNOW IT WAS NOT YOUR FAULT. SHE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND. [HUDSON] NO. SHE'S RIGHT. I FAILED YOU. -[GOLIATH] YOU SENT FOR US? -YES. I'LL NEED YOUR HELP. WE'RE READY. WHATEVER YOU COMMAND, WE WILL DO. GOOD. WE MUST FIND THE ARCHMAGE AND RETRIEVE THE MAGIC BOOK. TIME IS ON HIS SIDE. IF WE DON'T FIND HIM BEFORE DAWN, WE NEVER WILL. I CAN'T FAIL AGAIN. PERHAPS IT'S TIME HE STEPPED DOWN. I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM LOOK SO OLD. HIS AGE BRINGS WISDOM. THAT'S WHY HE LEADS. [DEMONA] THIS GAME IS FUTILE. YOU WERE TOO OLD TO PLAY IT 1,000 YEARS AGO. I COULD RAKE THIS ROOM WITH THE LASER. THERE'S NO WAY YOU'D ESCAPE. BUT I'M GIVING YOU ONE LAST CHANCE, HUDSON. GOLIATH'S TIME IS OVER. I AM THE LEADER NOW. SWEAR FEALTY TO ME AND YOU'LL LIVE. VERY WELL, THEN. DIE HIDING, LIKE THE COWARDS YOU ARE. PLEASE. LEAVE ME HERE. SAVE YOURSELF. GARGOYLES DON'T LEAVE THEIR WARRIORS BEHIND. [EXPLOSION] OH, BUT YOU'RE A CLEVER OLD THING. ARE YOU FOOLISH ENOUGH TO GO UNDERGROUND WHERE YOU CAN'T USE YOUR WINGS? WE'LL MAKE IT THROUGH THIS NIGHT YET, LAD. NEVER FEAR. YOU'RE A TOUGH ONE. I ALWAYS KNEW THAT. REMEMBER THE SEARCH FOR THE ARCHMAGE? NOW THAT QUEST TOOK GUMPTION. TRACKING WON'T BE EASY ONCE THE STORM BREAKS. HE'S NOT EVEN TRYING TO DISGUISE HIS TRAIL. HE FAVORS SPEED OVER STEALTH. THAT COULD MEAN HE'S EXPECTING PURSUIT. IT COULD ALSO MEAN THAT HE'LL BE LAYING TRAPS. YOU'RE YOUNGER, STRONGER. HE SHOULD BE FOLLOWING YOU. YOU ARE WRONG, MY LOVE. HE IS THE BEST ONE TO LEAD US. AND, IN ANY EVENT, NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO ARGUE THE POINT. [STONES CLATTER] HE'S GONE TO GROUND THERE. OUR WINGS WILL BE USELESS IN HERE AND THIS ARCHMAGE HAS POWERFUL MAGIC. I DID NOT TRACK HIM THIS FAR TO GIVE UP NOW. I WILL NOT FAIL THE PRINCE AGAIN. AND I WON'T LET HIM DO THIS ALONE. I DON'T KNOW WHO'S THE BIGGER FOOL. HIM FOR GOING, YOU FOR FOLLOWING OR ME FOR NOT LEAVING YOU BOTH? WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE THIS ALL MEANS? [GASPS] THERE! FULMINUS, VENITE! [DEMONA SCREAMS] IT'S HOPELESS, HUDSON. SAVE YOURSELF. HEAR ME, LAD. WE GO TOGETHER. OR WE DON'T GO AT ALL. YOUR COURAGE IS ADMIRABLE, BUT ULTIMATELY FUTILE. I'LL MAKE IT QUICK, OLD SOLDIER. WHAT? AAARGH! [PANTING] STAY WITH ME, LAD. WE'VE BEEN IN WORSE SCRAPES THAN THIS. REMEMBER? [EXPLOSIONS] WE'VE COME FOR THE GRIMORUM. FULMINUS, VENITE! [GROWLS] -ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? -YES, AND SO IS THE PRINCE NOW. [ARCHMAGE] FILTHY BEAST! GIVE IT TO ME! [GASPS] AAARGH! [GROANS] GOOD WORK, YOU TWO. DON'T TALK. SAVE YOUR STRENGTH. [THUNDER RUMBLING] [THUNDER RUMBLING] [THUNDER RUMBLING] [DOOR CREAKING] STAY HERE, LAD. I'LL BE BACK FOR YOU. YOU... CAN'T... FACE... HER. I CAN FACE HER. I JUST CAN'T BEAT HER. [THUNDER RUMBLING] NAH! JOIN ME OR JOIN GOLIATH IN DEATH. DON'T BE A FOOL. TOGETHER WE CAN RULE THIS WORLD. [ROARS] ENOUGH OF THIS! TIME TO DIE, OLD FOOL. UHH! [GUNFIRE, CLATTERING] -[HUDSON SCREAMING] -HUDSON! [WEAPONS CLASH] I WOULD HAVE ENDED THIS QUICKLY. NOW YOU WILL SUFFER! [GROANS] [WEAKLY] DEMONA, NO. GOLIATH, SO GOOD OF YOU TO JOIN US. [GOLIATH GROANS] GIVE IT UP, GIRL. YOU CAN'T WIN. I'M SMALLER, STRONGER. I'M YOUNGER THAN YOU. YOUR PRIDE WILL COST YOU YOUR LIFE! [HUDSON GRUNTS] BUT I KNOW SOMETHING YOU DON'T, SOMETHING THAT COMES ONLY WITH AGE. I KNOW HOW TO WAIT. -[CRACKLING] -NO! THE ANTIDOTE HAS WORKED. YOU WILL RECOVER. THANK THE STARS YOU WERE ABLE TO BRING THE GRIMORUM IN TIME. IT WASN'T ME. I'M ONLY SAYING THAT THE CLAN NEEDS A YOUNG LEADER. -YOU'RE WRONG. -[HUDSON] NO. SHE IS RIGHT. IT IS TIME FOR ME TO STEP DOWN AND FOR YOU TO LEAD. IT WAS YOUR SKILLS THAT LED US TO THE ARCHMAGE. -I CANNOT TAKE COMMAND NOW. -IT'S TIME, MY FRIEND. THEN I WILL, BUT ONLY IF YOU STAY BY MY SIDE. I WILL NEED YOUR WISDOM TO GUIDE ME. [RUMBLING] NOW IT ENDS! YES, LASS. NOW IT ENDS. FEELING ALL RIGHT, LAD? JUST FINE. YOU THINK YOU'VE WON, BUT YOU'VE FORGOTTEN WHY YOU CAME. YOUR HUMAN FRIEND. BY NOW, THE POISON HAS RUN ITS COURSE. AND THERE IS NO ANTIDOTE. [DEMONA SCREECHES] IT'S PROBABLY BEST THAT SHE DOESN'T KNOW ELISA IS ALIVE. AYE. FOR AS LONG AS WE CAN KEEP IT A SECRET. THANK YOU FOR KEEPING ME ALIVE, HUDSON. THERE'S NO-ONE ELSE I'D RATHER HAVE AT MY SIDE. I'D FORGOTTEN THAT FOR A TIME. [CHUCKLES] I THOUGHT MY WARRIOR DAYS WERE OVER. NONSENSE! THERE ARE YEARS OF FIGHTING LEFT FOR YOU. AH, NOW THERE'S SOMETHING TO LOOK FORWARD TO! [BOTH CHUCKLE]
