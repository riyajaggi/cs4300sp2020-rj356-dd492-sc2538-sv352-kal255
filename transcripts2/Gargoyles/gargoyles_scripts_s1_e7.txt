 THAT'S IT. I'M... I'M OFF SUGAR. [TIRES SCREECH] PHEW! [ROAR OF ENGINES] YES! KINDRED SPIRITS! HEY, RIGHTEOUS HOG, MAN! -THAT'S SOME CHERRY RIG, BRO. -GLAD YOU LIKE IT. -WHERE'D YOU GET IT? -MY FRIENDS AND I MADE IT. HEY, COOL. WHAT? IT'S A FREAKING MONSTER! GET HIM! -[BIKERS SHOUT] -HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? [PUNCHES THUD] [GROWLS] YOU WANNA FIGHT? YOU GOT IT! [GROWLS] OW! -I WAS JUST TRYING TO FIT IN! -GET HIM! [GROWLS] ENOUGH! LET'S SEE IF YOU'RE BULLETPROOF, FREAK! [SCREECHING] MY BIKE! [GUNSHOT] [CLICKING] BROADWAY? LEXINGTON? NONE OF THE ABOVE. DEMONA? DON'T BE AFRAID. I JUST WANT TO TALK. UH-HUH. YEAH, LAST TIME WE MET -YOU WANTED TO BLOW ME AWAY WITH A BAZOOKA -THAT WAS THEN. -AND THIS IS GOODBYE! -WAIT! PLEASE. I'M SORRY, BROOKLYN. I KNOW I SHOULDN'T HAVE SHOT AT YOU. I WAS CRAZY WITH RAGE AND FEAR IF YOU ONLY KNEW WHAT I'D GONE THROUGH FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS, DEALING WITH THE HUMANS. HUNDREDS OF YEARS? I THOUGHT YOU WERE UNDER THE SLEEP SPELL LIKE WE WERE. IT'S A LONG STORY. CENTURIES-LONG. -I'D LIKE TO TELL YOU IT, IF YOU LET ME. -I DON'T TRUST YOU, DEMONA. WASN'T THIS LIKE OLD TIMES? FIGHTING TOGETHER SIDE BY SIDE. COMRADES IN ARMS. -STAY BACK! -I SAVED YOUR LIFE JUST NOW. DOESN'T THAT AT LEAST ENTITLE ME TO A MOMENT OF YOUR TIME? ALL RIGHT. I'M LISTENING. WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? ELVIS? -WHERE'S BROOKLYN? -HE'S OUT JOYRIDING. JOYRIDING? I WANT TO HELP YOU. HELP ALL THE GARGOYLES. THOSE HUMANS YOU MET. WHAT DID YOU DO TO PROVOKE THEM? I DID NOTHING. THEY JUST ATTACKED ME. EXACTLY. THAT'S WHAT HUMANS ARE LIKE. BUT...GOLIATH SAYS WHEN THEY GET USED TO US... THEY WERE USED TO US A THOUSAND YEARS AGO. DID THAT STOP THEM FROM BETRAYING AND DESTROYING OUR KIND? I... I DON'T KNOW. YOU DON'T KNOW THE DEPTHS TO WHICH HUMANITY CAN SINK, MY YOUNG FRIEND. BUT I DO. OVER THE CENTURIES I'VE SEEN HORRORS THAT WOULD BLAST YOUR SOUL. COME. LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT MANKIND IS REALLY LIKE. [SCREAM] HELP, POLICE! POLICE! WHAT WOULD YOU DO? CAPTURE HIM FOR HUMAN JUSTICE? HE'D BE OUT OF JAIL AND BACK ON THE STREETS IN A DAY. LOOK, HIS GRADES STINK. HIS FRIENDS ARE HOODLUMS. WHAT DO YOU CARE? YOU'RE NEVER HOME, ANYWAY! THEY CAN'T SHARE THEIR OWN HOMES WITHOUT FIGHTING. AND YOU THINK THEY WILL SHARE THIS WORLD WITH US? [POLICE RADIO] THEY HOLD EACH OTHER'S LIVES COMPLETELY WITHOUT WORTH. DO YOU REALLY THINK THEY WOULD ACCEPT US WITH OPEN ARMS? [SIGHS] NO. AND THIS IS NOT THE WORST OF IT. WE MUST MAKE GOLIATH SEE THE TRUTH. HUMANITY WILL NEVER TRUST OR ACCEPT US. BUT NOT ALL HUMANS ARE LIKE THAT. ELISA'S OUR FRIEND. PERHAPS THE POLICEWOMAN IS THE EXCEPTION THAT PROVES THE RULE. BUT CAN SHE KEEP YOU SAFE FROM HUMANITY? ONLY WE CAN PROTECT EACH OTHER, BROOKLYN. WE MUST BE UNITED AND STRONG. AND WILLING TO DEAL WITH THE HUMANS, AS THEY WOULD WITH US. GOLIATH THINKS WE CAN HIDE IN THEIR MIDST LIKE MICE. AND HOPE FOR THEIR UNDERSTANDING. THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE. REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED TO GOLIATH AND LEXINGTON. THEY WERE HUNTED LIKE ANIMALS BECAUSE LEXINGTON TRUSTED THE PACK. HOW DID YOU KNOW? IF YOU THINK I'M WRONG, THEN SHOW YOURSELF TO THEM. [POLICE RADIO] VERY WISE, MY YOUNG FRIEND. THEY WOULD SHOOT YOU DOWN LIKE A DOG. LET'S SAY YOU'RE RIGHT. WHAT CAN WE DO? GOLIATH STILL BELIEVES HUMANITY WILL ACCEPT US EVENTUALLY. GOLIATH MUST BE MADE TO SEE THE TRUTH FOR THE GOOD OF ALL. THERE IS A WAY, BROOKLYN. THE GRIMORUM ARCANORUM. BRING IT TO ME. THERE IS A SPELL OF TRUTH IN ITS PAGES. WITH IT I CAN OPEN GOLIATH'S EYES. ONCE GOLIATH UNDERSTANDS, THE REST WILL FOLLOW HIM. [SIREN] [WIND HOWLS] HOW WAS YOUR... JOYRIDE? -UH... ILLUMINATING. -GOLIATH! I'M GLAD I CAUGHT YOU BEFORE DAWN. YES ELISA, IS SOMETHING WRONG? THERE WILL BE. XANATOS' SENTENCE IS ALMOST UP. HE'LL BE OUT OF JAIL IN A MONTH. SO YOU SAID BEFORE. WHY DOES THIS CONCERN YOU? IT CONCERNS YOU! YOU'LL HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER PLACE TO LIVE. BUT DON'T WORRY, I THINK I'VE FOUND THE PERFECT PLACE. THERE IS NO NEED FOR THAT. XANATOS HAS BEEN BEATEN. THE CASTLE IS OURS NOW. HOW DO WE KNOW? WHAT IF HE RECLAIMS IT? WE WILL DEAL WITH THAT IF AND WHEN IT HAPPENS -BUT WE ARE NOT LEAVING OUR HOME. -BUT, GOLIATH... THAT'S ONE WAY OF AVOIDING A CONVERSATION. [CRACKING] [GROWLING] LET'S GET SOME BREAKFAST. -YOU COMING, BROOKLYN? -MAYBE LATER. [DEMONA] I KNEW YOU'D COME. -I BROUGHT THE BOOK. -EXCELLENT. NOW ALL I NEED IS GOLIATH. BUT HOW TO GET HIM HERE? I'LL HANDLE THAT. ANYTHING TO MAKE HIM SEE THE TRUTH. TAKE YOUR TIME. THE SPELL REQUIRED IS COMPLEX. I'LL NEED TO STUDY IT. GOLIATH... I FOUND A FASCINATING PLACE. HOW SO? IT'S LIKE THE WORLD WE CAME FROM. IT'S THE CLOISTERS. WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE IT? IT'S BEAUTIFUL. I WISH WE'D BROUGHT THE OTHERS. IT'S GOOD YOU DIDN'T. BECAUSE WE WANTED YOU HERE ALONE. DEMONA... SO YOU DID SURVIVE. I ALWAYS SURVIVE. THE GRIMORUM. BROOKLYN, WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE? JUST LISTEN TO HER, GOLIATH. PLEASE. SHE HAS SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT TO SAY TO YOU. HE'S RIGHT, GOLIATH. LISTEN. AND OBEY. "SINE DUBIO, INSTANTATUM." AAARGH! GOLIATH? WHAT'S HAPPENED? I THOUGHT THE SPELL WAS SUPPOSED TO OPEN HIS EYES. IT WILL. WATCH. HUMANS ARE OUR ENEMIES. -HUMANS ARE OUR ENEMIES. -NO, THIS WASN'T THE PLAN. I WANTED TO FREE HIS MIND, NOT ENSLAVE IT. YOU WANTED HIM TO KNOW TRUTH. NOW WHAT WE TELL HIM WILL BE THE ONLY TRUTH HE KNOWS. YOU'RE INSANE! GIVE ME THAT BOOK. BROOKLYN, WAIT! YOU MUST TRUST ME. I WAS A FOOL TO TRUST YOU! GOLIATH, RESTRAIN HIM! [ROARS] ARGH! GOLIATH, IT'S ME, BROOKLYN. STOP! [ROARS] WAIT! BROOKLYN! I WON'T HURT YOU. DON'T YOU SEE? THIS IS THE ONLY WAY. THIS IS ONLY TEMPORARY. HE WILL OBEY WHOEVER HOLDS THE SPELL. WE CAN PROTECT HIM FROM HIS NAIVETY UNTIL WE REACH OUR GOALS. GOLIATH, LISTEN TO ME. YOU CAN'T LET DEMONA CONTROL YOU. YOU'VE GOT TO SNAP OUT OF IT. [IMPACT GRUNT] I HATE TO DO THIS, BUT YOU LEAVE ME NO CHOICE. "SINE DUBIO..."ARGH! GOLIATH, STOP HIM! YOU FOOL! DO YOU THINK I HAVE COME THIS FAR JUST TO LET YOU TO STOP ME NOW? GOLIATH, DESTROY HIM! I HOLD THE BOOK. YOU MUST OBEY ME. YOU HOLD THE BOOK, DEMONA. BUT I HOLD THE SPELL. GOLIATH, TAKE HER. EVEN WITH NO WILL OF YOUR OWN, YOU'RE A FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITH. [SCREECHING] YOU'VE WON. THIS TIME. NO! [DEMONA SCREECHES] [SIGHS] COME ON...LET'S GO HOME. I'VE GONE THROUGH THE GRIMORUM PAGE BY PAGE, BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW TO REVERSE THE SPELL DEMONA PUT ON GOLIATH. YOU MEAN, HE'S GOING TO BE LIKE THIS FOREVER? I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN UNDERSTAND ME, GOLIATH, BUT...I'M SORRY. THIS IS ALL MY FAULT. IF I HAD LET DEMONA TALK ME INTO STEALING THE GRIMORUM. HOW ARE WE GOING TO HELP HIM? WE CAN'T DEFEAT THE SPELL. WAIT A MINUTE. WE DON'T DEFEAT THE SPELL. WE USE IT. HERE. OK, BIG GUY. I'M HOLDING THE SPELL. AND THAT MEANS YOU HAVE TO DO WHAT I SAY. GOLIATH, I ORDER YOU TO ACT FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE EXACTLY AS YOU WOULD IF YOU WERE NOT UNDER A SPELL. [LOW GROWL] VERY CLEVER, ELISA. -[GOLIATH] IT WORKED! -ALL RIGHT! I KNEW DEMONA WAS WRONG ABOUT YOU AT LEAST. ANY SPECIES THAT HAS YOU FOR A MEMBER CAN'T BE ALL BAD. ER...THANKS. I THINK. GOLIATH...I'M SORRY. YOU APOLOGIZED ONCE ALREADY, BROOKLYN. I COULD HEAR, EVEN THOUGH I COULD NOT ACT. WHAT DEMONA SAID SOUNDED TRUE AT THE TIME. OF COURSE IT DID. IT'S A HALF-TRUTH SHE HAS THOROUGHLY EMBRACED. BUT IT'S NOT THE WHOLE TRUTH. COME. THE SUN IS RISING AND I COULD USE SOME REST. HEY, WHAT HAPPENED TO THE MOTORCYCLE? UH... IT BLEW UP. OH... WHAT? [THEME MUSIC PLAYING]
