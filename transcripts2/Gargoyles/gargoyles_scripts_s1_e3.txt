NOW YOU CAN LET ME LOOK THE PLACE OVER OR I CAN COME BACK WITH A WARRANT AND A LOT MORE COPS. IT'S YOUR CALL. [PINGS] [BELL] MUST HAVE A HECK OF A HEATING BILL! DETECTIVE MAZA, I'VE JUST CALLED THE MAYOR TO OFFER MY PROFOUND APOLOGIES FOR WHAT HAPPENED. WHAT EXACTLY DID HAPPEN HERE, MR XANATOS?

 OWEN WAS A LITTLE CONFUSED. THAT'S FOR THE PRESS. THE TRUTH? MY MEN REPELLED AN INVASION BY A RIVAL CORPORATION TRYING TO STEAL OUR NEW TECHNOLOGY. [GASPS] "REPELLED AN INVASION"? YOU'RE A PRIVATE CITIZEN, XANATOS, NOT A COUNTRY. [BEEP] DETECTIVE, I AM THE OWNER OF A MULTINATIONAL CORPORATION, WHICH IS BIGGER THAN MANY COUNTRIES YOU COULD NAME. I ASSUME YOU HAVE PERMITS FOR THE WEAPONS I HEARD BEING FIRED UP HERE? [XANATOS] OF COURSE. WOW! LOOK AT ALL THIS STUFF! IT'S FANTASTIC. WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE THIS DOES? -WHOA! -HEY! [PANS CLATTER] [GROWLS] HEY! LET ME OUT! IT'S COLD IN HERE. -WE'LL SAVE YOU! -YOU PUSH AND WE'LL PULL. [CLATTERING] [BOTH] URGH! -[ALL] AAARGH! -[CRASH] EXCUSE ME, MR XANATOS. THERE SEEMS TO BE A PROBLEM IN THE KITCHEN WITH OUR NEW GUESTS. I HOPE I'VE ANSWERED ALL YOUR QUESTIONS SATISFACTORILY, DETECTIVE MAZA. OWEN WILL SHOW YOU OUT. EXCUSE ME. IF YOU'LL COME WITH ME? [RUSTLING] IS THERE A PROBLEM, DETECTIVE? THAT STONE GARGOYLE UP THERE. I COULD HAVE SWORN I SAW IT MOVE. [NERVOUS LAUGH] YES. THIS OLD PLACE IS RATHER SPOOKY AT NIGHT. I'VE THOUGHT THE SAME THING MORE THAN ONCE. [BELL] -GOOD NIGHT, DETECTIVE. -GOOD NIGHT. [BELL] SORRY, PAL, BUT THIS INVESTIGATION ISN'T OVER YET. DON'T TELL ME. THIS IS WHERE DRACULA SHOWS UP. HA! A GOOD LAUGH WOULD BE WORTH A LOT OF MONEY RIGHT NOW. [SNIFFS] [GROWLS] [DEEP GROWL] [COCKS PISTOL] OK, PAL, LET ME SEE YOU! NICE AND EASY. [GROWLS] AAH! AAAH! [SCREAMING] [SCREAMING] [PANTING] OK. OK. JUST TAKE IT EASY. -WHAT WERE YOU IN MY CASTLE? -YOU... YOU CAN TALK? WHO... WHAT ARE YOU? MY KIND HAVE NO NAMES, BUT YOU HUMANS CALL ME "GOLIATH". YOUR "KIND"? YOU MEAN, THERE'S MORE THAN ONE OF YOU? [DEEP BREATH] BARELY. WAIT. DON'T GO. UH, LOOK, WE NEED TO GET DOWN TO THE STREET OR UP TO THE CASTLE. -SINCE YOU CAN FLY... -I CAN'T FLY. I CAN ONLY GLIDE ON CURRENTS OF WIND. THERE ARE NONE STRONG ENOUGH HERE TO LIFT US BACK UP. SO WE'RE STUCK HERE? HUH? AAAH! HOLD ON. AAH! -TRUST ME. -I DON'T BELIEVE THIS. [PANTING] [GROWLS] -[GASPS] I FORGOT ABOUT HIM. -HE WON'T HURT YOU. [BARKS] NOW, ONCE AGAIN, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? AND, PLEASE, DON'T FALL OFF THE BUILDING THIS TIME. A FINE MESS YOU MADE OF THAT KITCHEN, LADS. WHEN I HEARD THAT CRASH, I THOUGHT THAT... LOOK! GOLIATH IS TALKING TO THAT HUMAN. SO, A THOUSAND YEARS AGO, YOU WERE BETRAYED BY THE ONE HUMAN YOU TRUSTED. DOES ANYONE ELSE KNOW ABOUT YOU? ONLY THE MAN CALLED XANATOS. HE BROUGHT US HERE. OH, THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING. [SNIFFS] -IS THIS A NEW FRIEND, GOLIATH? -BOY, I HOPE SO. THIS IS ELISA MAZA. A... DETECTIVE? SECOND CLASS. NYPD. WHAT EXACTLY DOES A DETECTIVE DO, LASS? WELL, UH, WHEN SOMEBODY DOES SOMETHING WRONG, I FIND OUT WHO AND ARREST THEM. WHO SAYS WHAT'S WRONG? WELL, WE HAVE A JUSTICE SYSTEM. LAWS, PENALTIES, ASSESSMENTS THAT THE PEOPLE DECIDE. YOU MEAN, THE HUMANS DECIDE? YOU HAVE TO GO NOW. WAIT! WILL I SEE YOU AGAIN? I'D LIKE TO KNOW MORE ABOUT YOU. LOOK YOU SAVED MY LIFE. I OWE YOU. LET ME HELP YOU UNDERSTAND THIS CITY, YOU NEED TO KNOW HOW IT WORKS. IF WE'RE TO DEFEND THE CASTLE, I SUPPOSE WE NEED TO BE PREPARED FOR WHATEVER'S OUT THERE. -VERY WELL. -GOOD. TOMORROW'S MY DAY OFF I'LL MEET YOU IN THE AFTERNOON-- -AT AFTER DARK. WHY AM I NOT SURPRISED? OK. HERE. AFTER DARK. NO. NOT HERE. OVER THERE. ON THAT ROOFTOP. -WHY THERE? -WHY WERE YOU SNEAKING INTO THE CASTLE? A GOOD DETECTIVE TRUSTS NO-ONE. THAT'S ONE THING WE HAVE IN COMMON. IT SEEMS THAT MUCH HAS CHANGED FROM WHAT WE KNEW. YES, AND IF WE ARE TO SURVIVE IN THIS NEW WORLD, WE NEED TO LEARN ABOUT IT AND THE HUMANS WHO RULE HERE. GOLIATH! IT IS ALMOST DONE, XANATOS. MY FRIENDS AND I MUST SLEEP SOON. THIS WON'T TAKE LONG. I'M ASKING FOR YOUR HELP, GOLIATH. THAT TEAM WHO ATTACKED US EARLIER STOLE SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT FROM ME. THE BOX THEY TOOK CONTAINED THREE OF THESE DISKS. -DISKS? -THINK OF THEM AS MAGIC TALISMANS, EACH ONE CONTAINING HUNDREDS OF SPELLS. IT IS VITALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS GET THEM BACK FOR ME. PERHAPS YOU SHOULD USE A... DETECTIVE. YOU ARE LEARNING FAST. I CAN'T GO TO THE POLICE. I'VE HAD TO FORESTALL AN INVESTIGATION OF THE FIGHT. THINK OF THE TROUBLE IT WOULD CAUSE IF THEY LEARNED OF YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS. YOU COULD BE LOCKED UP FOR STUDY OR EVEN WORSE. REMEMBER, YOU'RE THE ONLY GARGOYLES LEFT. -HUMANS WILL FEAR YOU. -AND BETRAY US. [SIGHS] WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE US DO? MY SOURCES HAVE DISCOVERED THAT THOSE THIEVES WERE HIRED BY A MULTINATIONAL COMPANY CALLED CYBERBIOTICS. AMAZING. IT'S LIKE A... A LIVING TAPESTRY. YOUR NAIVETY IS REFRESHING, GOLIATH. THE STOLEN DATA ARE BEING HELD AT THREE DIFFERENT LOCATIONS. THE FIRST IS A RESEARCH CENTER ON AN ISLAND IN THE BAY. THE SECOND IS DEEP BENEATH THE CITY, HEAVILY FORTIFIED BASE. THE THIRD IS BEEN KEPT IN A HUGE AIR FORTRESS THAT FLIES IN A HOLDING PATTERN OVER THE CITY. ALL THREE PLACES MUST BE HIT SIMULTANEOUSLY, SO NONE WILL BE ABLE TO NOTIFY THE OTHERS. IT SEEMS AN ABSURD AMOUNT OF PROTECTION, I KNOW, BUT REST ASSURED THE INFORMATION IS THAT IMPORTANT. WHY DO YOU WANT US TO HELP? THIS MUST BE DONE BEFORE THEIR SCIENTISTS BREAK THE ENCRYPTION CODES, BEFORE THEY TRANSLATE THE SPELLS. THIS IS MUCH DIFFERENT THAN PROTECTING THE CASTLE. IT WILL ENDANGER THE LIVES OF MY CHARGES. I CANNOT RISK THAT. THINK ABOUT MY REQUEST. I'M SURE OUR ENEMIES MEAN TO USE THIS INFORMATION FOR SOME TERRIBLE PURPOSE. [WHOOSH] DON'T WORRY. EVERYTHING'S GOING ACCORDING TO PLAN. [HOWLS] [YAWNS] WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING? TO EXPLORE THE CITY. AFTER ALL WE CAN'T SPEND REST OF OUR LIVES IN THE CASTLE. HE'S RIGHT. IF WE'RE GOING TO LIVE HERE, WE'VE GOT TO KNOW ALL ABOUT THIS CITY. -ITS PEOPLE, ITS DEVICES... -ITS FOOD! OH, VERY WELL. THE THREE OF YOU MAY EXPLORE. BUT STAY CLOSE TO THE BUILDING AND STAY OUT OF SIGHT. [WHINES] [DOOR CREAKS] HELLO? ANYONE THERE? -[GROWL] -[GASPS] THERE YOU ARE. WHY WERE YOU HIDING BACK THERE? I WANTED TO MAKE SURE YOU WERE ALONE. NOT TO WORRY. YOU LOOK LIKE YOU COULD HANDLE A WHOLE SWAT TEAM. -[GASPS] -WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? JUST MAKING CERTAIN YOU WERE NOT BEING AMBUSHED. YOU GUYS ARE PARANOID EVEN FOR NEW YORK. ARE YOU COMING ON THE TOUR? WHAT DO I CALL YOU, ANYWAY? MUST YOU HUMANS NAME EVERYTHING? NOTHING'S REAL TO YOU TILL YOU'VE NAMED IT, GIVEN IT LIMITS. IT'S NOT LIKE THAT. IT'S JUST THAT... WELL... UH... THINGS NEED NAMES. DOES THE SKY NEED A NAME? -DOES THE RIVER? -THE RIVER'S CALLED THE HUDSON. [SIGHS] FINE, LASS. THEN I WILL BE THE HUDSON, AS WELL. GREAT. "HUDSON" IT IS. I DON'T KNOW HOW I'M GOING TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM NOTICING YOU. SIMPLE. WE'LL STAY ON THE ROOFTOPS. EASY FOR YOU WITH THOSE WINGS, BUT WHAT ABOUT ME? [GASPS] WELL, THAT ANSWERS THAT QUESTION. [CLEARS THROAT] LET'S BE OFF. COMING... HUDSON? [SIRENS] I THINK NOT. THIS NEW WORLD IS TOO BIG, TOO BRIGHT, TOO LOUD. NOW THAT I KNOW YOU'RE ALL RIGHT, I'LL RETURN TO GUARD THE CASTLE. WELL, LOOKS LIKE IT'S JUST YOU AND ME. WHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE? THE DANGERS THAT THREATEN ME AND MY KIND. LIGHTEN UP, WILL YOU? YOU'RE BRINGING ME DOWN AND I'M A COP. WHAT DO YOU THINK SO FAR? SUCH AMAZING CHANGES MEN HAVE MADE WHILE WE SLEPT. STONE STREETS. FINER THAN THOSE THE ROMANS BUILT. -TOWERS OF GLASS AND IRON. -YEAH. I'M USED TO IT. BUT I GUESS IT'S PRETTY IMPRESSIVE TO AN OUT-OF-TOWNER. I SEE NO WALLS TO GUARD THIS CITY. HOW DO YOU PROTECT IT FROM INVADERS? WELL, OUR BIGGEST WORRIES AREN'T FROM OUTSIDE, THEY'RE FROM INSIDE. THAT I AM ALL TOO FAMILIAR WITH. [WHIMPERS] AYE, BOY, I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL. IT'S A STRANGE NEW WORLD. WOOF! [SIGHS HAPPILY] WELL, NOW, THIS ISN'T TOO BAD. [SNIFFS] [ROCK MUSIC] YEEEOW! DON'T TELL ME. THERE'S A CHARMING, UNDISCOVERED BISTRO BEHIND THAT DUMPSTER? -GIVE IT A REST, MARGOT. -[ENGINE FAILS TO START] WHAT DO YOU EXPECT? YOU ONLY PAID 40 GRAND FOR THE CAR. THERE MUST BE INTERFERENCE. I CAN'T GET THROUGH. WONDERFUL! PRICELESS! NOW WHAT DO WE DO? MAYBE I CAN FIX IT. YOU HAVE TO CALL A REPAIRMAN TO PLUG IN THE COFFEEMAKER! [MAN] YOU GOT A PROBLEM, PAL? HEY, MAYBE WE CAN HELP. I HAD A YEAR OF AUTO SHOP. UH, NO PROBLEM. I JUST CALLED THE POLICE. THEY'LL BE HERE ANY MINUTE. -GOT A PASSPORT, MOOK? -PASSPORT? YEAH. YOU'RE ON OUR TERRITORY AND WE DON'T LIKE VISITORS. -UH... -PAPERS, PLEASE! -GIVE HIM YOUR WALLET, BRENDAN. -I DON'T HAVE MUCH CASH ON ME. OH, WE'RE REAL SORRY TO HEAR THAT... BRENDAN. WHAT? AREN'T YOU BOYS LATE FOR YOUR 4H CLUB MEETING? MAN, IT JUST KEEPS GETTING BETTER, DON'T IT? POLICE. POLICE, HUH? WE'RE VERY IMPRESSED. -I'M WARNING YOU GUYS. -YOU'RE WARN...? HAVE IT YOUR WAY. [GROWLING] [ROARS] -IT'S A MONSTER! -TRASH IT! UGH! [PUNCH THUDS] STAY BACK! MARGOT, RUN! -HUMAN GRATITUDE? -I GUESS. YOU KNOW, GOLIATH, YOU'RE THE BEST THING TO HAPPEN TO THIS CITY IN A LONG TIME. I'VE NEVER SEEN SO MANY WONDERS. LOOK! -I'VE GOT TO SEE HOW IT WORKS. -WAIT! WHAT A BEAUTIFUL DEVICE! HUH? AAAH! -AAARGH! -WAIT. COME BACK! -GOLIATH SAID NOT TO LET ANYBODY SEE US. -I DIDN'T MEAN HIM TO SEE ME. I JUST WANTED TO LOOK AT HIS MACHINE. -BE CAREFUL. -IT LOOKS EASY ENOUGH. WHOA! MAYBE WE'D BETTER NOT TELL GOLIATH ABOUT THIS. WE'RE PROBABLY THE ONLY COUPLE IN THE PARK WHO DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT MUGGERS. THIS WORLD IS JUST AS SAVAGE AS THE ONE I REMEMBER. YOU'RE JUDGING IT THE WAY HUMANS HAVE JUDGED YOU. AND SURE, THE CITY SHOWS AN UGLY FACE SOMETIMES, BUT... THERE'S MORE TO IT THAN THAT. THERE'S BEAUTY HERE, MOMS THAT SING TO THEIR KIDS, THE WAY MY MOM USED TO. -HUH? -GOLIATH, WHAT IS IT? AAARGH! UGH! -[ELISA SCREAMS] -[ROARS] AAARGH! WHAT DO YOU WANT? WE'RE JUST TYING UP LOOSE ENDS. [MAN] NEXT ON GARGOYLES... YO, TAXI. THIS IS HOW THEY FOUND US. [XANATOS] THERE'S SOMEONE HERE I WANT YOU TO MEET. [THEME MUSIC PLAYING]
