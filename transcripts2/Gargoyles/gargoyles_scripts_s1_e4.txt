LOT TO GO THROUGH FOR A PIECE OF LAWN SCULPTURE. [FOOTSTEPS] I'VE RUN THIS PATH FOR FIVE YEARS, AND I'VE NEVER NOTICED THAT STATUE BEFORE. YEAH. THIS PARK'S JUST FULL OF SURPRISES. [GASP] GOLIATH. ARE YOU OK? -OF COURSE. -THAT SEDATIVE HAS WORN OFF. SLEEP REJUVENATES US. YOU STAYED WITH ME THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE DAY? YEAH WELL, SOMEONE HAD TO MAKE SURE THOSE COMIC BOOK REJECTS DIDN'T FIND YOU. THANK YOU. IT IS VERY POSSIBLE THAT YOU SAVED MY LIFE. SO NOW WE'RE EVEN. I MUST RETURN. THEY'LL BE WORRIED ABOUT ME. I UNDERSTAND. SO... LATER TONIGHT? DON'T WORRY, LADS. HE'LL BE BACK. WE DIDN'T SURVIVE 1,000 YEARS' SLEEP JUST TO LOSE HIM NOW. -I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT. -[WHIMPERS] LOOK! -WE WERE WORRIED ABOUT YOU. -WHAT HAPPENED? IT APPEARS WE HAVE ENEMIES. -[BLEEP] -WE'RE READY FOR HIM NOW, OWEN. GIVEN WHAT HAPPENED, I WISH YOU HAD ACCOMPANIED US LAST NIGHT, HUDSON. -HUDSON? -AYE, IT'S MY NAME. WHAT WOULD YOU MAKE OF IT? -IT'S A FINE NAME. -HUDSON. I LIKE IT. WE SHOULD CHOOSE NAMES, TOO. NAMES THAT SUIT OUR NEW LIVES HERE. OH? AND WHAT MIGHT THEY BE? MMM... BROOKLYN. I'M BROOKLYN. BROADWAY. OOH...LEXINGTON. DO YOU LIKE IT? THEY'RE ALL FINE NAMES. I GUESS HE'LL NEED ONE AS WELL. OH, I'VE GOT ONE FOR HIM, TOO. FROM NOW ON, YOU'RE BRONX. [GRUMBLES] [LAUGHS] I THINK HE LIKES IT. AHEM. YOU WISH TO SEE ME, XANATOS? GOLIATH, THERE'S SOMEONE HERE I WANT YOU TO MEET. AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE, I BELIEVE. WHO? [GASPS] HUH? YOU'RE ALIVE! GOLIATH, MY LOVE. -MY ANGEL. IT REALLY IS YOU. -OH, GOLIATH. ALL THE DAYS THAT I'VE DREAMED OF YOU AND THIS MOMENT. AHEM. I'M VERY HAPPY FOR YOU BOTH. THIS MAN HAS BROUGHT US TOGETHER, MY LOVE. WE OWE OUR REUNION TO DAVID XANATOS. BUT...HOW? YOU WERE SHADOWED BY THE VIKINGS. NO. I FEARED FOR YOUR SAFETY, SO I LEFT THE CASTLE TO FIND YOU. I LOST MY WAY AND THE SUN ROSE BEFORE I COULD RETURN. HOW DID YOU SURVIVE ALL THESE CENTURIES? WHEN I RETURNED TO THE CASTLE, THE MAGUS HAD ALREADY TURNED YOU TO STONE. I BEGGED HIM TO CAST HIS SPELL ON ME SO THAT WE MIGHT AWAKEN TOGETHER. I SAW HER A YEAR AGO AND WAS SO IMPRESSED, I ACQUIRED HER FOR MY COLLECTION. THEN, AFTER I WOKE YOU, IT SEEMED PLAUSIBLE THAT A TRIP TO THE CASTLE MIGHT HAVE THE SAME EFFECT ON HER. WITH YOU ALIVE, I CAN START TO LIVE AGAIN AS WELL. AS YOU SAID, YOU AND I ARE ONE. NOW AND FOR EVER. [EXCLAMATIONS OF SURPRISE] -IS IT REALLY YOU? -HOW DID YOU...? I'LL ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS LATER. IT'S JUST SO GOOD TO SEE ALL OF YOU AGAIN. MY LOVE, I MUST ASK A FAVOR OF YOU. ANYTHING. XANATOS HAS TOLD ME OF THE DISKS THAT WERE STOLEN FROM HIM. HE WANTS OUR HELP IN RETRIEVING THEM. YES AND I THINK WE SHOULD HELP HIM, OUT OF GRATITUDE FOR REUNITING US, IF NOTHING ELSE. I AGREE. PERHAPS, BY HELPING HIM, WE CAN RID OURSELVES OF THE HUMANS WHO HUNT US. BESIDES... WITH YOU BY MY SIDE, I CAN DO ANYTHING. [BLEEPING] I'VE EXPLAINED THE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF EACH FORTRESS, AND GIVEN YOU WHAT I THINK ARE THE BEST PLANS OF ATTACK. ONLY YOUR SPEED AND STRENGTH CAN STAND AGAINST THEIR DEFENSES. WE WILL TAKE THE AIR FORTRESS. -YOU THREE WILL BREACH THE TOWER. -COOL. -WHAT? -IT'S A NEW WORD WE LEARNED LAST TIME. IT INDICATES A POSITIVE RESPONSE. AH... ER... HUDSON, THE UNDERGROUND BASE IS YOURS. BUT TAKE BRONX WITH YOU. -I'M PERFECTLY CAPABLE OF... -TAKE HIM WITH YOU. HE NEEDS THE EXERCISE. [GROWL] BE CAREFUL ALL OF YOU. HUMANS ARE MUCH MORE DANGEROUS IN THESE TIMES. COME ON, THEN. LET'S GO! THEY'D BETTER NOT BE HARMED. THEY ARE YOUNG AND IMPETUOUS BUT THEY ARE ALSO WARRIORS TRAINED BY THE BEST. TO SOAR WITH YOU AGAIN. IT'S LIKE A DREAM. WE'VE DREAMED FOR A THOUSAND YEARS, GOLIATH. IT'S TIME FOR OUR DREAMS TO COME TRUE. THE DISK WILL BE WELL GUARDED, NO DOUBT. IF HUMANS WISH TO THROW AWAY THEIR WORTHLESS LIVES GUARDING IT, THAT'S THEIR CONCERN. THIS WAY. [MAN] HOLD IT RIGHT THERE! YOU WON'T FIRE THOSE GUNS IN HERE. YOU COULD DAMAGE THE AIRSHIP. -DON'T BET YOUR LIFE ON IT, MONSTER. -IT'S TOO RISKY. STAND BACK. I'M WARNING YOU. [SNARLS] [GUNFIRE] [SCREECHES] [GROWLS] ARGH! WHOA! THE GUNFIRE MAY ALERT THE OTHERS. WE'D BETTER HURRY. WAIT. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE? I'M MAKING SURE THEY DON'T CAUSE US MORE TROUBLE LATER. NO. TO KILL IN BATTLE IS ONE THING, BUT NOT LIKE THIS. THE CENTURIES HAVE MADE YOU WEAK, GOLIATH. [CLATTERING] THE MAGIC IN THIS CENTURY IS SO... SO... -COOL? -EXACTLY. WE NEED A WAY IN. NO PROBLEM. XANATOS SAID IT'S FOUR FLOORS DOWN. [GROANING] WOOH. THIS ISN'T LIKE THE ELEVATORS BACK AT THE CASTLE. HMM. NOT ENOUGH ROOM TO GLIDE DOWN. WELL, WE'LL JUST USE THIS ROPE HERE IN THE MIDDLE. ONE... TWO... THREE... FOUR. LOOKS LIKE THIS IS IT. THIS IS EASY. WE'LL HAVE THAT DISK AND BE BACK IN TIME FOR SUPPER. A LATE SUPPER.
