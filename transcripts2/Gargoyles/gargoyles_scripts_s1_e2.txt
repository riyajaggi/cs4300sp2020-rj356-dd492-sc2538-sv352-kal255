YOU TURNED THEM TO STONE FOREVER? THE TERMS OF THE SPELL WERE THAT THEY WOULD SLEEP UNTIL THE CASTLE RISES ABOVE THE CLOUDS. WE'VE DONE YOU A GREAT WRONG, GOLIATH. Magus: I KNOW THAT NO APOLOGY CAN BE ENOUGH, GOLIATH. I WISH THERE WAS SOMETHING I COULD DO. WHAT WILL YOU DO NOW, PRINCESS? I'LL TAKE MY PEOPLE TO MY UNCLE. IT'S NO LONGER SAFE FOR US HERE. I HAVE A REQUEST. YOU HAVE BUT TO NAME IT. THE EGGS IN THE ROOKERY WILL SOON HATCH. THEY WILL NEED GUIDANCE. NEVER FEAR. WE WILL WATCH OVER THEM AS IF THEY WERE OUR OWN. THERE IS SOMETHING... YOU CAN DO FOR ME, MAGUS. CAST YOUR SPELL ONE MORE TIME. AT LAST, CASTLE WYVERN. [BELL RINGS ONCE] MAGNIFICENT. MAKE THE OFFER NOW, OWEN. THIS INSTANT. MAY I SAY ONE LAST TIME, MR. XANATOS, THAT THE COSTS OF THIS VENTURE WILL BE ASTRONOMICAL. START HIRING CREWS. I WANT TO BEGIN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. IT MAY PROVE DIFFICULT TO FIND THE NECESSARY MANPOWER.

EXCELLENT. -HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN? -THIS MAY BE A SHOCK. A THOUSAND YEARS HAVE GONE BY SINCE THE SPELL WAS CAST. I LEARNED ABOUT THE CASTLE AND YOU SIX FROM AN ANCIENT BOOK THAT RECENTLY CAME INTO MY POSSESSION. THE MAGUS WHO CURSED YOU WROTE THE WHOLE STORY DOWN IN THERE. NOW, I'M SURE YOU HAVE QUESTIONS. HOW DID YOU BREAK THE SPELL? IT WAS DESIGNED TO END WHEN THE CASTLE ROSE ABOVE THE CLOUDS. THE EGGS IN THE ROOKERY? GONE, I'M AFRAID. YOU ARE THE LAST OF YOUR KIND. WHY HAVE YOU DONE ALL THIS? I WAS FASCINATED BY THE MAGUS' STORY, I WANTED TO SEE IF IT WAS TRUE. AND NOW THAT I KNOW IT IS, I WANT TO BE YOUR FRIEND. THERE'S MUCH WE CAN DO FOR EACH OTHER, GOLIATH. SUCH AS? -WELL... -[APPROACHING HELICOPTER] I'M NOT EXPECTING ANYONE. YOU'LL BE SAFER IF YOU STAY HERE. SECURE THE AREA. -WHAT DO YOU WANT? -YOU'LL KNOW, SOON ENOUGH. WHAT'S GOING ON? WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE? THEY'RE ATTACKING THE CASTLE. THAT'S ALL WE NEED TO KNOW. [ROAR] OOH! [GROWLS] NICE MASK. [YELPS] LEAVE HIM ALONE. ARE YOU A VIKING? THESE WEAPONS!

[PANTING] I'VE NEVER SEEN WEAPONS LIKE THOSE BEFORE. AND THAT FLYING CREATURE THAT CARRIED THEM OFF. -A DRAGON WITHOUT A DOUBT. -IT WASN'T A DRAGON. IT WAS A MACHINE OF SOME SORT. THANK YOU. WITHOUT YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS, WHO KNOWS WHAT THOSE THUGS MIGHT HAVE DONE. SOMEONE I ONCE TRUSTED SAID THE SAME THING TO ME. AND THEN DESTROYED MY PEOPLE. HMM. I CAN SEE I'LL HAVE TO WORK HARD TO EARN YOUR TRUST. HMMM. -OWEN, WE NEED A CLEANUP CREW OUTSIDE. -WHY WERE YOU ATTACKED? THE RICHER YOU ARE, THE MORE ENEMIES YOU HAVE. AND I'M VERY RICH. GOLIATH, THIS IS YOUR HOME, AS WELL AS MY HEADQUARTERS. I HOPE YOU'LL CONSIDER WORKING WITH ME TO KEEP IT SAFE. IT'S YOUR DECISION, LAD, BUT... WE'VE NOWHERE ELSE TO GO. THIS CASTLE IS OUR HOME, NO MATTER WHERE IT HAS BEEN TAKEN. -WE'LL STAY HERE. -EXCELLENT. I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN USED POORLY BY MEN IN THE PAST, BUT ALL THAT IS ABOUT TO CHANGE. TRUST ME. YOU BROKE THE SPELL OF SLEEP THAT IMPRISONED US XANATOS, AND FOR THAT WE ARE GRATEFUL. BUT WE WILL NEVER TRUST HUMANS AGAIN. I CAN TELL THIS RELATIONSHIP IS SOMETHING WE'LL ALL HAVE TO WORK AT.
