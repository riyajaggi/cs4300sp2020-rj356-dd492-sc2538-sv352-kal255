 HE WORKED WITH ME TO CLOSE THE DRACON BUSINESS. -YOU DROPPED THIS. -THANKS. NO OFFENSE, I'M SURE YOU'RE A GREAT COP, BUT I DON'T NEED A PARTNER. HEY, I UNDERSTAND. PROBLEM IS, YOU HAVE A PARTNER. ME. GUESS WE HAVE TO JUST MAKE THE BEST OF IT. THERE MUST BE SOME KIND OF CONSPIRACY GOING ON TO MAKE MY LIFE DIFFICULT. WOULDN'T SURPRISE ME. LOOK, I HAVE SOMETHING TO TAKE CARE OF...ALONE. I'LL MEET YOU OUTSIDE IN 20 MINUTES. YOU GUYS BETTER APPRECIATE THIS. [BROADWAY] LET ME HELP YOU, ELISA. THANKS, BROADWAY. HEY! NEAT TOY, HUH? HEH, YEAH SLOW IT DOWN OR I'LL GIVE YOU A TICKET. -WHERE'S GOLIATH? -DOWN IN THE LIBRARY. -YOU STAYING FOR BREAKFAST? -NO, THANKS. I GOTTA GET BACK TO WORK SOON. [ELISA] GOLIATH? -WHAT ARE YOU READING? -DOSTOYEVSKY. YEAH? WHO'S IT BY? KIDDING. [HELICOPTER APPROACHES] WHAT'S WRONG? XANATOS... HE STOLE OUR ANCESTRAL HOME, DROVE US INTO HIDING HERE. AND I WAS UNABLE TO PREVENT IT. HEY, LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, YOU DIDN'T LOSE A CASTLE, YOU GAINED A LIBRARY. THIS IS HIS CENTURY, HIS WORLD. WE ARE OUTCASTS, STRANGERS IN A STRANGE LAND. WE HAVE NO HOPE OF REGAINING WHAT IS RIGHTFULLY OURS. YOU'RE RIGHT, IT'S A LOUSY DEAL. BUT XANATOS WON'T STAY ON TOP FOREVER. WHAT GOES AROUND COMES AROUND, GOLIATH. I WOULDN'T WANT HIS KARMA. IF ONLY I COULD MAKE HIM FEEL WHAT I FEEL NOW. WELL, IT'S NOT A SIX FOOT SCREEN BUT I HOPE IT'LL DO. IT'S A GRAND GIFT, LASS. THANK YOU. XANATOS! THIS IS TRAVIS MARSHALL AT THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART, WHERE ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST PRICELESS JEWELS, THE EYE OF ODIN IS BEING DONATED BY DAVID XANATOS FROM HIS PRIVATE COLLECTION. THIS IS QUITE A PHILANTHROPIC ACT, MR XANATOS. THE EYE IS WORTH MILLIONS. TO JUST GIVE IT AWAY? WELL, TRAVIS, I JUST FELT THAT THE EYE SHOULD BE SHARED WITH THE WORLD INSTEAD OF LOCKED AWAY IN MY PERSONAL MUSEUM. BESIDES, IT'S A GREAT TAX WRITE-OFF. A GRAND GESTURE FROM A MAN KNOWN FOR GRAND GESTURES. [ROARS] A FEW MORE DONATIONS LIKE THIS AND NEW YORK MIGHT EVEN FORGET ABOUT YOUR PRISON RECORD. I MADE A MISTAKE, MR MARSHALL. I PAID MY DEBT TO SOCIETY. ALL I'M TRYING TO DO NOW IS GIVE SOMETHING TO BENEFIT OTHERS. WOULD YOU RATHER I KEPT THE EYE? YOUR LIMO IS READY MR XANATOS... PERFECT TIMING, OWEN. AS ALWAYS. IT APPEARS I'M NOT APPRECIATED AROUND HERE. YOU AND ME BOTH, PAL. [SMASHING GLASS AND ALARM] [MATT] THEY'RE CALLED THE ILLUMINATI. WAY I HEAR IT, THEY RUN EVERYTHING. EVEN THE PRESIDENT WORKS FOR THEM. LOOK, MATT, YOU NEED TO KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT ME. I DON'T CARE ABOUT UFO'S, LOCH NESS OR SECRET SOCIETIES. BELIEVE ME, THE WORLD'S STRANGE ENOUGH AS IT IS. [POLICE RADIO STATIC] ALL UNITS, ALL UNITS, 10-31 AT MUSEUM OF MODERN ART. [SIREN] [ALARM] WAIT FOR BACKUP. WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY THERE MIGHT BE. POLICE! FREEZE! NO! [METALLIC PING] WHY'D YOU TRY TO STOP ME? HEY, UH, WHO KNOWS WHAT THAT THING WAS? IT MIGHT HAVE BLOWN UP WHEN YOU HIT IT YEAH, OK. MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT. SO, ANY IDEA WHAT I WAS SHOOTING AT? NOT A CLUE. ACCORDING TO SIGHTINGS ALL OVER TOWN, THERE ARE AT LEAST THREE OF THESE THINGS. WELL, THEY'RE NOT SHY ABOUT BEING SEEN. -THIS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. -WHAT'S THAT, MAZA? CHECK THIS OUT. THIS STATION HAS ACQUIRED THE SECURITY CAMERA COVERAGE OF THE ROBBERY LAST NIGHT. ACCORDING TO WITNESSES, THIS GARGOYLE-LIKE CREATURE ATTACKED A GUARD AND THEN FLEW AWAY FROM THE SCENE. YOU TWO SAW THAT...THING. CARE TO SPECULATE? ALL I KNOW IS I HIT IT WITH A .38 SLUG AND DIDN'T EVEN SLOW IT DOWN. -MAZA, ANY IDEAS? -NOT YET. SO THERE YOU HAVE IT. SOMEONE'S IMPERSONATING YOU, GOLIATH. DO YOU THINK IT'S POSSIBLE THERE ARE OTHER GARGOYLES ALIVE OUT THERE? YOU GUYS ARE TOUGH BUT YOU'RE NOT BULLETPROOF. I HEARD MATT'S SLUGS BOUNCE OFF METAL. XANTATOS' ROBOTS. THE STEEL CLAN? I THOUGHT WE DESTROYED THEM ALL. WE DID. HE MUST HAVE MADE MORE. IT MAKES NO SENSE. WHY WOULD XANATOS DONATE THE JEWEL TO THE MUSEUM AND THEN HAVE IT STOLEN? NO DOUBT HE HAS SOME SORT OF DEVIOUS PLAN IN MIND. HUDSON, YOU AND BRONX GUARD OUR NEW HOME. THE REST OF YOU, COME WITH ME. -WHERE ARE YOU GOING? -TO DEAL WITH XANATOS. HOLD ON, GOLIATH. I WOULDN'T TAKE THE CHANCE OF BEING SEEN IF I WERE YOU. YOU'RE NOT RATING VERY HIGH IN PUBLIC OPINION POLLS RIGHT NOW. NO, ELISA. NO MORE HIDING. XANATOS WILL ANSWER TO ME FOR THIS. GOLIATH, WAIT! [MATT] YO, PARTNER. NO OFFENSE, MATT, BUT THIS IS SOMETHING I HAVE TO HANDLE ALONE. NO WAY. NOT WITH THOSE STAINLESS STEEL MONSTERS OUT THERE. LOOK, THIS IS ONE TIME I DON'T WANT A PARTNER. YEAH? WELL THAT'S USUALLY THE TIME YOU NEED ONE THE MOST. COME ON, GET IN. XANATOS, YOU HAVE GONE TOO FAR. FIRST YOU STEAL OUR HOME AND NOW YOU STEAL OUR VERY IDENTITIES. YOU'VE GOT IT ALL WRONG. I'M THE BEST FRIEND YOU HAVE IN THIS WORLD. [SNARLS] [ROARS] I'M SORRY, DETECTIVE MAZA, MR XANATOS IS IN AN IMPORTANT MEETING. I'VE ALWAYS BEEN WELCOME BEFORE. THINGS CHANGE, DETECTIVE. I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU HAVE A WARRANT. [XANATOS] YOU SEE, SOON, EVERYBODY IN THE BIG APPLE WILL BE HUNTING GARGOYLES. BECAUSE OF YOU! IF YOU WANT TO BE PICKY, WE WON'T GET ANYWHERE. LET'S TRY TO FOCUS ON THE BIG PICTURE, GOLIATH. I'VE GOT A RESEARCH FACILITY UPSTATE WHERE YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS COULD BE COMFORTABLE -AND PROTECTED. -WHAT? DOESN'T SEEM A DIFFICULT CHOICE TO ME. STAY HERE IN THE CITY AND BE HUNTED DOWN LIKE ANIMALS. OR BE MY GUESTS IN A SAFE HAVEN. WHAT DO YOU SAY? [LOW GROWL] [ROARS] LET'S GO! YOU'RE TAKING THIS MUCH TOO PERSONALLY. WELL, THAT WAS SPECTACULARLY UNSUCCESSFUL. YEAH. COME ON, HURRY. I CAN TELL WORKING WITH YOU IS GOING TO BE GOOD AEROBICS. [TIRES SQUEAL] [BROOKLYN] SO WHAT HAPPENED? -DID XANATOS ADMIT HE WAS-- -I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT. [GUNSHOT] GOLIATH! AAGH! IT'S THE STEEL CLAN! WE'VE BEATEN THEM BEFORE. WE CAN DO IT AGAIN. -IT'S THOSE GARGOYLES! -CALL THE COPS! GET SOME BACKUP! BROADWAY! YAARGH! OW. HEY, WE'RE STILL ALIVE. HOW COME? IT'S LIKE THEY'RE WAITING FOR SOMETHING. NO DOUBT FOR US TO LEAD THEM BACK TO OUR NEW SANCTUARY. BUT WHY? WHY NOT JUST KILL US? BECAUSE XANATOS DOESN'T WANT TO DESTROY US. HE WANTS TO DOMINATE US. HE'S PROBABLY CONTROLLING THEM BY RADIO LIKE THAT TOY CAR I HAVE. -YEAH, SO WHAT DO WE DO NOW? -[SIREN] WHAT'S GOING ON UP THERE? LOOKS LIKE THAT URBAN MYTH ABOUT GARGOYLES JUST BECAME URBAN REALITY. WE CAN'T LEAD THEM BACK TO THE CLOCK TOWER AND WE CAN'T STAY HERE. IT'S NOT LONG TILL SUNRISE. WE COULD TACKLE THEM AGAIN. YEAH, I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT. THEY'RE TOUGHER THAN THE LAST BATCH WE FOUGHT. YEAH, PARTICULARLY THAT ONE. WE MUST CONTINUE THE FIGHT SOMEPLACE ISOLATED. COME! -THAT'S THEM! -LOOK, THERE THEY ARE! [SHOUTING CONTINUES] THEY'RE HEADING SOUTH. -WHERE ARE WE GOING, GOLIATH? -THERE. YOU TAKE THE OTHERS. I'LL HANDLE THE LEADER. OK, TIN MAN, LET'S PLAY FOLLOW THE LEADER. AAGH! NO, MACHINE, YOU'LL NOT GET RID OF ME THAT EASILY. GIVE IT UP, DUMPSTER FACE. WE MUST GO, QUICKLY. [WHIR OF ROTOR BLADES] -THANKS FOR THE EXCLUSIVE. -YOU OWE ME ONE. THE PUBLIC'S BEEN REASSURED THAT THE GARGOYLES WERE ROBOTS. WHO CREATED THEM IS STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION. XANATOS TRIED TO FORCE US TO REVEAL OUR NEW HOME. WE DEFEATED HIM. AND IF WE DID IT ONCE, WE CAN DO IT AGAIN. AND WE WILL. TOGETHER. DON'T TELL ME ROBOTS. WHAT I SAW THROUGH THOSE BINOCULARS WAS NO ROBOT. IT WAS A FLESH AND BLOOD SOMETHING. LOOK, IT WAS DARK, THEY WERE A LONG WAY OFF. DO YOU BELIEVE WHATEVER YOU WANT. I KNOW WHAT I SAW. AND I'M GONNA FIND OUT WHAT IT WAS. IT WOULD APPEAR THAT YOUR PLAN TO LEARN THE GARGOYLES' HIDING PLACE HAS GONE AWRY, SIR. NOT REALLY. I HAVE THE EYE OF ODIN BACK IN MY PRIVATE COLLECTION, AND THE CITY OWES ME A FAVOR FOR DONATING IT. I SUCCESSFULLY TESTED THIS PROTOTYPE BATTLE EXOFRAME. -AND THE MOST IMPORTANT THING... -YES, SIR? I WAS A LITTLE WORRIED THAT I MIGHT BE GETTING SOFT. BUT I WAS ABLE TO STAND UP AGAINST GOLIATH, THE GREATEST WARRIOR ALIVE. I'D SAY I'VE STILL GOT THE EDGE.
