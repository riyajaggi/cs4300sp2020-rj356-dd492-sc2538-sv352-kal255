THE BULLET HIT HIGH IN CHEST, RICOCHETED OFF THE COLLAR BONE, NICKED THE HEART MUSCLE AND PASSED THROUGH THE RIGHT LUNG I REMOVED IT FROM THE BASE OF HER SPINE. THE GOOD NEWS IS SHE SURVIVED TEN HOURS OF SURGERY. THE NEXT 12 HOURS ARE CRUCIAL. SHOULD WE... HAVE HER SISTER FLY IN FROM ARIZONA? DON'T TALK LIKE THAT, DAD. SHE'LL BE OK. WELL, WHAT CAN WE DO?

JUST TELL ME YOU KNOW WHO SHOT MY SISTER. WITNESSES SAY SHE BRACED TONY DRACON AT THE PARK MANOR. HE STOLE AN ARMED SHIPMENT AND SHE WAS PRETTY DETERMINED TO GET THOSE GUNS OFF THE STREET. OUR GUESS IS ONE OF DRACON'S MAN BROKE INTO HER APARTMENT AND SHOT HER WITH HER OWN GUN. DRACON MAY EVEN HAVE DONE IT HIMSELF. -ANY PRINTS ON THE GUN? -SOME. BUT SO BADLY SMUDGED, THEY DON'T LOOK HUMAN. WHOEVER THE SHOOTER IS, WE'LL FIND HIM. NO-ONE HITS A COP AND GETS AWAY WITH IT. NO-ONE. I THINK WE SHOULD LET HER SLEEP. KEEP FIGHTING, ELISA. DON'T GIVE UP. COME BACK TO US. KNOW THAT I WILL FINISH WHAT YOU STARTED. I'LL FIND THE MAN THAT DID THIS TO YOU AND I WILL MAKE HIM PAY.

[WHIRRING] [GOLIATH] YOU WERE THE BUYER. MR XANATOS HAD TO GET THE GUNS BACK SOMEHOW. EXCELLENT JOB BY THE WAY. HE'LL BE PLEASED THAT YOU HAVE RECOVERED HIS PROPERTY. [GROWLS] ARE ALL THE WEAPONS THAT WERE STOLEN HERE? HARD TO SAY FOR CERTAIN. BUT I ESTIMATE THAT 37 GUNS, RIFLES AND HEAVY WEAPONS ARE MISSING. NO DOUBT THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN SOLD ON THE STREET. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? MAKING SURE THAT NO MORE OF THESE FALL INTO THE WRONG HANDS. WAIT! MR. XANATOS ISN'T GOING TO LIKE THIS. I'LL BE HAPPY TO DISCUSS THE MATTER WITH HIM. HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? MAKING SURE THE POLICE LINK YOU WITH THE STOLEN PROPERTY. COME. WE HAVE A SICK FRIEND TO VISIT. YOU MEAN, ELISA ISN'T DEAD? OH, MOM?

THEY FOUND HIM IN A WAREHOUSE WITH XANATOS' GUNS, ALL OF THEM DESTROYED. HE WAS BABBLING ABOUT MONSTERS ATTACKING HIM AND HIS MEN. YOU'LL HAVE TO LEAVE NOW. SHE'S PAST THE CRISIS POINT BUT SHE NEEDS HER REST. HI, GUYS. ELISA, IT WAS ALL MY FAULT. I WAS PLAYING WITH YOUR GUN AND... IT WENT OFF. I'LL NEVER TOUCH A GUN AGAIN. I SHOULD HAVE BEEN A LOT MORE CAREFUL ABOUT WHERE I LEFT IT WE BOTH MADE MISTAKES. YEAH. BUT YOU NEARLY PAID FOR THOSE MISTAKES WITH YOUR LIFE. THEN LET'S NOT REPEAT THEM. COME.
