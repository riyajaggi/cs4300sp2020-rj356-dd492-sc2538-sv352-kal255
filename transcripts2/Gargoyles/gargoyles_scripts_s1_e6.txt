 [SNARLS] [HOWLS] [ELEVATOR BELL PINGS] I HAVE TO TELL YOU, MR. BURNETT, I’M STILL SURPRISED AT BEING ASKED BACK HERE SEEING AS HOW I BUSTED YOUR BOSS.

 ELISA, WHAT A PLEASANT SIGHT TO GREET US AS WE AWAKEN. WELL, IT’S A SLOW NIGHT AND I WAS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD -GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN, LASS. -CATCH YOU LATER. [ELISA] HEH, THEY’RE IN A HURRY. THEY ARE FASCINATED BY THE THINGS THEY SEE ON THE TELEVISION. EVERY NIGHT THEY RUSH TO TURN IT ON. BUT WELCOME TO OUR HOME. ESPECIALLY NOW THAT XANATOS HAS BEEN DEFEATED, AND THIS CASTLE IS TRULY OURS ONCE MORE. THAT’S WHAT I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT. YOU KNOW THAT XANATOS WAS ONLY CONVICTED OF RECEIVING STOLEN PROPERTY. "CONVICTED?" HE WAS ACCUSED OF THAT SPECIFIC CRIME, AND THAT’S WHAT HE WAS SENT TO PRISON FOR.

 BUT HE ONLY GOT A SIX-MONTH SENTENCE, AND WE WERE LUCKY IT WASN’T SUSPENDED. HIS LAWYERS WILL PROBABLY GET THAT TIME CUT DOWN. THE POINT IS THAT IT’S NOT SAFE HERE FOR YOU GUYS. WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? I’M SAYING YOU’LL HAVE TO FIND A NEW PLACE TO SLEEP DURING THE DAY. A NEW HOME, GOLIATH. NO! THIS CASTLE IS OUR HOME. SORRY, BUT IT’S NOT. XANATOS BOUGHT IT LOCK, STOCK AND GARGOYLE. DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I’M SAYING? EVERY MINUTE YOU STAY HERE, YOU’RE IN DANGER. YOU WORRY TOO MUCH, ELISA. XANATOS WAS DEFEATED. WE ARE SAFE HERE. I THINK YOUR HEAD STAYS ROCK-HARD EVEN AT NIGHT. AHH, THIS WORLD IS FULL OF MARVELS, EH, BOY? [ACTION MUSIC] EH? -HEY! IT’S THE PACK! -COOL. SOMETHING’S WRONG. IT’S ON ALL THE CHANNELS AGAIN. I THOUGHT YOU LIKED THIS SHOW, HUDSON. AYE, I DO, BUT NOT EVERY NIGHT. [BUZZING] [ANNOUNCER] SEE THE PACK IN PERSON, TONIGHT AT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN. FOX, WOLF, DINGO, HYENA, AND JACKAL! WOW. THESE GUYS ARE GREAT. THEY’RE WARRIORS JUST LIKE US. YOUR FAVORITE HEROES IN A RARE PUBLIC APPEARANCE AT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN. [WEIGHTS BEING LIFTED, WHIRLING BOLA] -[WOLF] THIS IS GETTIN’ OLD. -[FOX] QUIT COMPLAINING. WE NEVER HAD IT THIS GOOD. [GRUNTS] LATER, HARVEY. WORK ON THOSE BACKFLIPS, HEAR ME? [SIGHS] WHEN WE TOOK THIS JOB, WE WERE PROMISED FAME, MONEY, AND ACTION. I’M NOT COMPLAINING ABOUT THE FIRST TWO, BUT I COULD USE SOME MORE OF THE THIRD. SOUNDS LIKE THE WOLFMAN IS GETTING BORED. [SNIGGERS] MAYBE A NEW HAIRCUT WOULD HELP. I DON’T NEED ANY SUGGESTIONS FROM YOU TWO CLOWNS. YEAH, WOLF’S RIGHT, FOX. THIS IS A CUSHY GIG BUT WE’RE ALL GETTIN’ SOFT. FLABBY AS I AM NOW, I PROBABLY WOULDN’T LAST A WEEK IN A CENTRAL AMERICAN WAR. BIRDS GOTTA FLY, FISH GOTTA SWIM, WOLF’S GOTTA HUNT. WELL, SINCE YOU’RE ALL ITCHING FOR ACTION, LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT CAME IN TODAY’S MAIL. WITH NO RETURN ADDRESS AND NO EXPLANATION. -STONE ME! -INTERESTING. YOU KNOW, I REMEMBER READING SOMETHING IN THE DAILY TATTLER. PEOPLE SAYING THEY’VE SEEN GARGOYLES COMING TO LIFE. RIGHT. AND ALLIGATORS LIVE IN THE SEWERS. -WHAT’S THE POINT OF IT? - [HYENA] HEY! YOU SAID YOU WERE LOOKING FOR ACTION. IMAGINE HUNTING SOMETHING LIKE THIS. WE’LL FIGURE IT ALL OUT LATER. RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE A PERSONAL APPEARANCE TO MAKE. [HORNS BEEP] [CHEERING] -ISN’T IT TIME FOR THE SHOW TO START? -RELAX. IT’LL HAPPEN. [ANNOUNCER] LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE WELCOME THE PACK! [CHEERING AND WHISTLING] OH, NO! IT’S THE EVIL NINJAS! [BOOING] THE NINJAS DON’T FIGHT WITH HONOR, LIKE THE PACK DOES. WOW! LOOK AT THAT! [ANNOUNCER] TEAMWORK, THAT’S THE KEY! [NINJAS GRUNT] THESE GUYS ARE ALRIGHT. YEAH, WOULDN’T IT BE GREAT TO MEET ’EM? [AUDIENCE CHANTING] PACK! PACK! PACK! [CHANTING AND WHISTLING CONTINUE] [ROARS] WELL SHOW’S OVER AND I’M STARVED. LET’S GO. YOU COMING, LEX? UHH...LATER. YOU-- YOU GUYS GO AHEAD. I’M GOING FOR IT. WELL, ANOTHER DAY, ANOTHER HALF MILLION DOLLARS. -[SCRAPING] -WHAT’S THAT? -WHAT IN THE WORLD...? -RELAX. I’M NOT AN ENEMY. IT TALKS. MY NAME IS LEXINGTON. I’M A WARRIOR...LIKE YOU. HEY FOX, THIS ONE’S NOT AS BIG AS THE ONE IN THE PICTURE YOU-- I’VE HEARD...STORIES, OF ANOTHER ONE LIKE YOU, ONLY... MUCH BIGGER. HOW DID YOU KNOW ABOUT HIM? LIKE I SAID, RUMORS, NEWS REPORTS. I WASN’T SURE THEY WERE TRUE... BUT I HOPED THEY WERE. YOU KNOW, WE’D LOVE TO MEET YOUR FRIEND. I THINK THAT CAN BE ARRANGED. ALMOST DAWN AND HE’S STILL NOT BACK. HE ALWAYS CUTS IT TOO CLOSE. [BROADWAY] THERE YOU ARE! WHERE WERE YOU? I MADE US SOME NEW ALLIES. YOU DON’T MEAN THE PACK? I SURE DO. THEY’RE JUST LIKE US. THEY DEFEND THE INNOCENT. -AND THEY DO IT ON TELEVISION. -YOU LET THEM SEE YOU? UH, YES. I DID. AND WHY NOT? YOU MADE FRIENDS WITH ELISA. THAT WAS DIFFERENT. THIS ARGUMENT WILL HAVE TO WAIT FOR NIGHTFALL, LADS. THIS ISN’T OVER. [LEXINGTON] YOU BET IT ISN’T. WHY IS ELISA DIFFERENT? THESE GUYS ARE DEFENDERS OF THE REALM, JUST LIKE SHE IS. HE MAY BE RIGHT, GOLIATH. I’VE SEEN THEM ON THE PICTURE BOX. THEY ARE CONSTANTLY ATTACKED BY THESE EVIL NINJAS. MAYBE THEY COULD USE OUR HELP. LOOK, IT’S NOT LIKE I REVEALED ALL OUR SECRETS. I’M NOT STUPID. THEY DON’T KNOW WE TURN TO STONE BY DAY, THEY DON’T EVEN KNOW WHERE WE LIVE. LOOK, WILL YOU PLEASE MEET THEM BEFORE YOU JUDGE THEM? I THINK IF ANYONE WOULD UNDERSTAND US, THEY WOULD. WE CAN’T HIDE FROM THE WHOLE WORLD UP HERE. THERE ARE KINDRED SPIRITS OUT THERE FOR US BUT WE’VE GOTTA LOOK FOR THEM, AND WE’VE GOTTA GIVE THEM A CHANCE. OR ELSE... ...WE’LL ALWAYS BE ALONE. ALRIGHT. TAKE ME TO MEET THEM. IF IT’S SAFE, WE’LL ARRANGE INTRODUCTIONS FOR THE REST OF YOU. -I DON’T LIKE THIS. -THEY SAID THEY’D BE HERE. ARGH! [EXPLOSION] IT’S A TRAP! [GUNFIRE] [CACKLES] [CACKLING] [ROARS] LEXINGTON! [HYENA CACKLES] [LEXINGTON] COWARDS! I THOUGHT YOU FOUGHT WITH HONOR! [FOX] WELCOME TO THE GAUNTLET. NORMALLY THE TRAPS IN HERE AREN’T LETHAL, BUT WE JUICED THEM UP A LITTLE JUST FOR YOU TWO. [GROWLS] THE ROOF! HURRY! LET THE HUNT BEGIN. -NO SIGN OF THEM. -I CAN’T BELIEVE IT! -THEY ATTACKED US! -YES. I THINK THEY PLANNED TO DO SO FROM THE MOMENT THEY MET YOU BUT WHY? WE’RE NOT THEIR ENEMIES. -THEY’RE NO MORE THAN ANIMALS. -WORSE THAN THAT. AN ANIMAL HUNTS BECAUSE IT’S HUNGRY. THESE HUNTERS DO IT FOR SPORT. I’M NEVER TRUSTING ANYONE AGAIN. [WHOOSHING] ARGH! LEXINGTON! [LEXINGTON] I’M ALRIGHT. [ELECTRICAL FIZZING] AARGHH! [GOLIATH GRUNTS] [FOX CACKLES] AARGHH! [BOY] HEY, LOOK! -IT’S THE PACK.

THEY’RE SHOOTING A MOVIE OR SOMETHING. YOU’LL GET IN THE WAY. GET BACK. THESE ARE DANGEROUS MONSTERS SENT BY THE EVIL NINJAS. WE’LL PROTECT YOU. -TAKE THAT, BEAST! -[GROWLS] YA! -THEY’RE MONSTERS! -THEY’RE ATTACKING THE PACK! WE’VE GOTTA HELP THEM! - STOP IT! - AHH! IT’S JUST A PUBLICITY STUNT OR SOMETHING. COME ON. - IT LOOKS AWFULLY REAL. - [PUNCHES LANDING] NOW WHILE THE STREET’S DESERTED, FINISH THEM QUICKLY! THIS WAY! TAKE ’EM DOWN. [ROARS] [DINGO SHOUTS] [SIGHS] NEEDLE IN A HAYSTACK. [LOW GROWL] HEY, WHERE’S HYENA? STAY TOGETHER. HEY! - I’M OUT OF HERE! - [WOLF] NO, WE CAN TAKE THEM. FORGET IT, THIS WASN’T IN MY CONTRACT. [FOX] JACKAL, NO! -[GROWLING] -AARGHH! AHH! [LOW GROWL] [ROAR] [SCREAMING] RELAX AND YOU’LL LIVE THROUGH THIS. [CAMERA SHUTTER SNAPPING] [GROWLS] [LEXINGTON WAILS] [FOX GRUNTS] [LEXINGTON, STRUGGLING] HELP! [GROANING] [GROWLS] WAH! FINALLY, SOME REAL ACTION. YAH! [GRUNTS] RAAAHH! - [WOLF GRUNTS] - [POLICE SIRENS APPROACHING] THE POLICE ARE COMING! THEN WE WILL LEAVE OUR FOES TO THEM. COME. WE DON’T HAVE MUCH TIME. [LEXINGTON] I FEEL LIKE A FOOL, LETTING THE PACK TALK ME INTO LURING YOU THERE. BECAUSE OF WHO WE ARE, WE HAVE TO BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT TRUSTING STRANGERS. I WAS SO TOTALLY WRONG. NO, LEXINGTON...YOU WERE RIGHT. WE CAN’T HIDE FROM THE WORLD. WE MUST LIVE IN IT. WE MUST SEARCH FOR ALLIES, KINDRED SPIRITS... AND SOMETIMES WE MUST TAKE CHANCES LIKE WE DID TONIGHT. TO DO OTHERWISE... IS TO REMAIN FOREVER ALONE. IT’S NICE TO KNOW THERE ARE STILL SOME HEROES LEFT. -WE JUST WATCHED THE NEWS. -THE PACK’S BEEN ARRESTED. THEY HAVE PHOTOGRAPHS OF FOX HOLDING A WOMAN HOSTAGE. I THOUGHT THEY WERE THE GOOD GUYS. MAYBE WE SHOULDN’T BELIEVE EVERYTHING WE SEE ON TELEVISION. [OWEN] EVERYTHING WAS DONE AS YOU STIPULATED, SIR. THE CABLE TV WAS ADJUSTED SO THAT THE ONLY PROGRAM THE GARGOYLES COULD SEE WAS THE PACK’S. THE PACK RECEIVED THE MYSTERIOUS ENVELOPE OF PHOTOGRAPHS AND REACTED JUST AS YOU PREDICTED. A PITY NOTHING ELSE HAPPENED ACCORDING TO PLAN. OH, I WOULDN’T SAY THAT, OWEN. THOUGH THEY DIDN’T KNOW IT WAS ME, I CREATED THE PACKTO BE MORE THAN JUST A TV SHOW. I HAD TO SEE HOW GOOD THEY WERE. AND HAVING UNDERESTIMATED GOLIATH ONCE BEFORE, I NEEDED TO KNOW WHAT HE WAS CAPABLE OF AS WELL. ALL IN ALL, I’D SAY THE TEST WAS MOST INFORMATIVE. [THEME MUSIC PLAYS]
