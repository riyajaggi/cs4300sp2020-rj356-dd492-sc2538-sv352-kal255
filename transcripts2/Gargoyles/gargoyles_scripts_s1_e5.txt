[ELECTRONIC BEEPING] SIR, CENTRAL REPORTS THAT STATION ONE HAS BEEN BREACHED. ANY DETAILS? WELL THEY SOUNDED RATHER HYSTERICAL, SIR. THERE WAS TALK OF...MONSTERS! HMM, I SEE. I WANT SECURITY HERE INCREASED. I’M STILL NOT SURE HOW WE GOT TALKED INTO DOING THIS. -[FAINT WHIRRING] -HERE’S A PROBLEM. [BEEPING] [BEEPING] [ALARM CONTINUES TO BEEP] [GUNS COCKING] I DON’T KNOW WHAT SORT OF THING YOU ARE, BUT I’M BETTING YOU’RE NOT BULLETPROOF. AYE, IT’S A WAGER YOU’D WIN! [HEAVY CLUNKING AND WHIRRING] [BRONX SNARLS] [GROWLS] [GUN FIRES] [ELECTRONIC HISSING] [SHOUTING] [BEEPING] [ROARS] HAH! COME, BOY. [ALARM] [DOORS WHIR] ACH, I’M GETTING TOO OLD FOR THIS.

YOU NEED TO BE LOSING SOME WEIGHT, AND THAT’S A FACT. I HOPE THIS WEE THING’S WORTH THE ACHES I’LL BE FEELING LATER. STATIONS ONE AND TWO HAVE BEEN BREACHED, WE’VE LOST TWO THIRDS OF THE DATA. WRONG. YOU’VE LOST IT ALL. [CRIES OF PANIC] ARGH! WHO... WHAT ARE YOU? -[BEEP] -MISSION ACCOMPLISHED. [ELECTRONIC HISSING] -HURRY, GOLIATH. -[ALARM SCREECHES] WHAT HAVE YOU DONE? COME ON. WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE. NO, WE CAN’T JUST LEAVE THEM HERE. [COUGHING, ELECTRIC CRACKLING] -LET’S GO. NOW! -[GOLIATH GRUNTS] [HUMANS COUGHING] [AGONIZED CRIES] [TIRES SCREECH] [EXPLOSION] GOLIATH? MY FRIENDS, YOU HAVE MY PROFOUND THANKS. REST ASSURED THAT THE KNOWLEDGE ON THESE DISKS WILL BE PUT TO BENEFICIAL USE FOR HUMANS AND GARGOYLES ALIKE. I HAVE PROMISED TO MEET A FRIEND. I’LL BE BACK SOON. A FRIEND, WHO? NOT ONE OF US? NO. A HUMAN. ELISA MAZA. ASIDE FROM XANATOS, WE HAVE NO HUMAN FRIENDS, NOR SHOULD WE. HUMANITY IS OUR ENEMY, GOLIATH. I THOUGHT YOU LEARNED THAT A MILLENNIUM AGO. I CANNOT MAKE WAR UPON AN ENTIRE WORLD! DOESN’T XANATOS PROVE THAT THERE ARE GOOD HUMANS, AS WELL AS BAD? CAN YOU FORGIVE THE HUMANS FOR WHAT THEY DID TO OUR KIND? THE ONES RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT HAVE BEEN DEAD FOR A THOUSAND YEARS. THEN THEIR DESCENDANTS SHALL PAY! I WILL HAVE BLOOD FOR BLOOD! YOU SAID THE CENTURIES HAVE CHANGED ME. THEY’VE CHANGED YOU, TOO. YOU’VE BECOME HARD, UNFORGIVING. YOU ARE NOT AS I REMEMBER YOU. I’M GOING TO SEE MY FRIEND NOW. SO BE IT. [BEEP] GOLIATH, IT SEEMS, IS TOO HARD TO CONTROL. HMM, A PITY. WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? - I’VE BEEN LOOKING ALL OVER TOWN FOR YOU! - WHY? THREE CYBER-BIOTICS INSTALLATIONS HAVE REPORTED ROBBERIES BY SOME KIND OF CREATURES, AND I SAW YOU AND ANOTHER GARGOYLE FLYING AWAY FROM THE PLANE WRECK. WHAT’S THIS ALL ABOUT GOLIATH? THE DISKS WERE STOLEN FROM XANATOS. WE RETURNED THEM TO HIM. REMEMBER THIS? I TRACED THAT EMBLEM. IT’S THE LOGO OF THE ROBOTICS FIRM THAT’S OWNED BY, ARE YOU READY? XANATOS ENTERPRISES! ARE YOU SAYING THAT XANATOS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ATTACK IN THE PARK? THAT’S EXACTLY WHAT I’M SAYING. HE PROBABLY PLANTED THAT BUG ON YOU HIMSELF. BUT THOSE WERE THE SAME MEN WHO STOLE THE DISKS FROM HIM. GOLIATH, NOTHING WAS STOLEN. I CHECKED. THOSE DISKS WERE CYBER-BIOTICS ’ PROPERTY. HE MUST HAVE STAGED THE THEFT TO TRICK YOU INTO STEALING THE DISKS. HE USED YOU. HE’S BEEN USING YOU FROM THE BEGINNING! LISTEN, GOLIATH. WE HAVEN’T KNOWN EACH OTHER VERY LONG AND I KNOW YOU DON’T HAVE ANY GOOD REASON TO TRUST HUMANS... ...BUT YOU’VE GOT TO TRUST SOMEBODY IN THIS WORLD AND I THINK YOU’D BE BETTER OFF WITH ME THAN XANATOS. [GROWLS] YOU WON’T REGRET IT. I’M AFRAID THE GARGOYLES HAVE OUTLIVED THEIR USEFULNESS. I CAN’T COUNT ON THEIR LOYALTY, BUT NOW, WITH THE DATA ON THOSE DISKS, I CAN GET THEIR REPLACEMENTS ON LINE. THREE HOURS UNTIL DAWN. -WE NEED ONLY TO WAIT UNTIL THEY SLEEP AGAIN-- - NO... YOU NEED TO TEST THESE REPLACEMENTS, DO YOU NOT? [SIGHS] YOU KNOW, I THINK I’M GONNA LIKE THIS CENTURY. YEAH, WE HAD A LITTLE TROUBLE ADJUSTING AT FIRST BUT, I THINK EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE FINE NOW. WHOA! ATTACK. WOAH! WHAT ARE THOSE THINGS? AAARGH! [YELLS] ARGH! WHAT DID I TELL YOU, OWEN? VAST IMPROVEMENT! THEY’RE STEEL INSTEAD OF STONE, THEY DON’T SLEEP DURING THE DAY, THEY CAN FLY INSTEAD OF GLIDE AND, BEST OF ALL, THEY’RE 100% OBEDIENT. ARGH! [STRAINS AND GROANS] [BEEPING] GIVE HIM TO ME. [LASER BLASTS] WHAT’S ALL THE NOISE? [BLASTS AND EXPLOSIONS CONTINUE] [HOWLS FIERCELY] NEVER A DULL MOMENT, IS THERE, BOY? POLICE BUSINESS. [LASER BLASTS] HMM. MY STEEL CLAN ISN’T PERFORMING AS WELL AS I’D HOPED. THERE’S ONLY ONE ROBOT LEFT. I THINK IT’S UP TO US, MY DEAR. [GROANS] WHAT’S GOING ON? I DON’T KNOW, BUT IT’S NOT OVER YET. ARGH! QUICKLY! AND THEY SAY THE MIDDLE AGES WERE BARBARIC! -WE WON, DUDE! -"DUDE"? YOU HAVEN’T WON ANYTHING, FOOLS! WHAT ARE YOU DOING? [XANATOS] HOLD IT. LET’S JUST LET THEM PLAY OUT THEIR LITTLE DRAMA, SHALL WE? GOLIATH, YOU’RE A FOOL. BUT THEN, YOU ALWAYS WERE, WEREN’T YOU? IF YOU’D ONLY TAKEN THE REST OF OUR CLAN AWAY FROM THE CASTLE THAT NIGHT... -THE PLAN WAS PERFECT. -PLAN? -IT WOULD’VE SUCCEEDED. -WHAT PLAN? I MADE A BARGAIN WITH THE CAPTAIN. I WAS TO GET US ALL OUT OF THE CASTLE SO THAT THE VIKINGS COULD SACK IT -WHAT? -IT WOULD HAVE WORKED. AND AFTER THE HUMANS WERE GONE, WE WOULD’VE HAD THE CASTLE ALL TO OURSELVES! BUT YOU RUINED IT. YOU HAD TO PROTECT THE HUMANS. YOU MADE US STAY AT THE CASTLE WHEN WE SHOULD’VE BEEN WITH YOU! WHEN THE VIKINGS ATTACKED, THE CAPTAIN SAID HE’D PROTECT US. BUT I DIDN’T TRUST HIM. I’VE STAYED ALIVE BECAUSE I DON’T TRUST ANYONE. - BUT WHY DID YOU DO IT? - YOU CAN ASK ME THAT? AFTER HOW THEY TREATED US? THEY HAD TO PAY! ALL HUMANITY HAS TO PAY FOR WHAT THEY DID TO OUR KIND! THERE IS GOOD AND EVIL IN ALL OF US, HUMAN AND GARGOYLE ALIKE. YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT, MORE THAN ANYONE! DON’T YOU SEE? NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF IT WEREN’T FOR YOU! DON’T SAY THAT! GOLIATH, THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE. HUMANITY IS A POISON THAT MUST BE PURGED FROM THIS PLANET. TOGETHER, YOU AND I CAN CREATE A NEW WORLD FOR OUR KIND. YOU TRUSTED ME ONCE. YOU LOVED ME ONCE. WE HAVE FOUND EACH OTHER AGAIN AFTER A THOUSAND YEARS OF SOLITUDE. DOES THAT MEAN NOTHING TO YOU? VERY WELL, THEN. IF YOU ARE NOT MY ALLY, THEN YOU ARE MY ENEMY. I HAVE A NAME TOO, GOLIATH. THE HUMANS GAVE IT TO ME LONG AGO. YOU SHOULD KNOW IT BEFORE YOU DIE. I AM DEMONA. -[COCKS WEAPON] -GOODBYE, GOLIATH. ARGH! [YELLING] [AGONIZED HOWLING] [GOLIATH] SHE WANTED ME TO DESTROY HUMANITY. I THINK I’LL START WITH YOU! GO AHEAD. WITHOUT ME, YOU’D STILL BE GATHERING MOSS. -[SNARLS] -[ELISA] NO, GOLIATH. DON’T DO THIS. GIVE ME ONE GOOD REASON NOT TO DROP HIM. BECAUSE IF YOU DO, YOU’RE THE SAME AS DEMONA. SHE’S RIGHT, LAD. IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT? [GRUNTS] NO. ARGH! [INDISTINCT POLICE RADIO] [HUDSON] YOU DID THE RIGHT THING, LAD. DO YOU THINK SHE SURVIVED? IF SHE DID, WE’LL KNOW SOON ENOUGH, I IMAGINE. HEY, WHERE ARE MY SUNGLASSES? THANKS, BRONX. [GLASS SHATTERS] -WISH I HAD TIME FOR A SNACK. -YOU JUST ATE. I KNOW. CHINESE FOOD. IT WAS GOOD, TOO, BUT, FOR SOME REASON, ABOUT AN HOUR LATER, I WAS HUNGRY AGAIN. IT’S NICE TO KNOW I HAVE AT LEAST ONE HUMAN FRIEND IN THIS NEW WORLD. I HOPE YOU HAVE MORE. LOTS MORE. BUT WHETHER YOU DO OR NOT, I’LL ALWAYS BE YOUR FRIEND, GOLIATH. -SAME TIME TOMORROW NIGHT? -I WOULDN’T MISS IT. GOOD. MAYBE WE’LL CATCH A GIANTS’ GAME. GIANTS? HMM. I WONDER IF THIS CITY’S READY FOR YOU GUYS. [THEME MUSIC PLAYS]
