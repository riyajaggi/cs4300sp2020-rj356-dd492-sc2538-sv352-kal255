 (Lisps) You reckon they got in through the back?
 Yeah, so we reckon it was drug addicts.
 Right. Yeah, they took all the drugs.
 Yeah, we had a whole packet of Beecham's,
 a bottle of Night Nurse, it's all gone.
 Doesn't surprise me. From where I'm standing, there are...
 ..145 points of entry into this shop.
 Are there? Yeah, try and keep me out.
 Alright.
 You see?
 That's why you need this.
 Normally I'm asked to install this system in zoos.
 The glass is soundproof.
 Why do you need soundproofing in zoos?
 Well, otherwise the kids start calling the lions 'pricks'.
 Oh, right.
 It's a very good system. You know the CIA?
 Yeah.
 They don't use this system. They'd probably use something a lot better.
 Oh, right, right, yeah. Wow.
 Yeah, 'cause I read something about the CIA.
 You know, they've apparently got
 this stationery, right, looks perfectly normal,
 but when you write on it, it dissolves.
 No, that's bollocks. Right, so it's pretty simple.
 When you're going out, just press 05 for on.
 And to disarm, just press 3369885421...
 (Continues silently)
 ..3999.
 You listening to me or what? What?
 Yeah...uh, yeah.
 Do you want me to go through it again?
 Uh...no, that's fine.
 Hi, Bernard! The alarm system's on.
 It prevents the door from being opened unless you put in the code.
 It makes it more secure.
 Uh...the glass is soundproofed. Oh, right.
 The glass is soundproofed. The thicker glass...
 You know what you are? You're a beard with an idiot hanging off it.
 Yeah.
 BEEPING, HISSING, ALARMS
 Well, here I am.
 Listen, your friend here's got all the details, so I'll be off.
 But certainly remember the three S's.
 The three S's?
 Yeah - security, security, security - three S's.
 Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't get what you were saying
 because of your amazing lisp. Sorry, sorry.
 So, what did you tell them? They got in through the back?
 Yes. Yeah, it wouldn't do to let them know we went out
 and you left the front door open, would it?
 Yeah, but what sort of world is it where you can't go away
 and leave the front door open without getting robbed?
 It's this sort of world, Gandalf.
 Alright, this is the main lock.
 You arm it by pressing 05.
 PHONE RINGS Hang on.
 Hello? Yes, no, I am going to pay that bill.
 I am...yes, I know.
 Yep...no, I...yep...
 Excuse me, could you... hang on...sorry...yes...
 Oh, you agree completely with everything I'm saying?
 That's terrific. Thank you, 'bye.
 How much for these?
 40 pounds. They're worth more than that!
 These are good hardbacks - Tolstoy...
 I know, I know, I know.
 But I don't want them. I mean, I'll have to price them then
 and put them up on the shelves and store them,
 and people will come in and ask about them
 and buy them and read them and come back and sell them you know,
 and the whole hideous cycle will just go on and on and on and on, you know?
 Just please, take them away, go away, no.
 It won't work. Here, look, here.
 Here's 40 quid. Just take them away, please.
 I got it! Ah-ha!
 Give, give, give.
 Oh, my God! What?
 It's Howell. Howell Granger, I was at college with him.
 Well, go and say hello. No, don't. No, don't.
 He confuses me.
 What?
 He confuses me. He's... he's a total arsehole...
 ..but he's got this voice and it just does things to me.
 (Husky voice) Fran?
 My God, what are you doing here?
 Howell...hello!
 I...have a shop.
 I mean, I work next door. Oh.
 How...how are you?
 Oh, I'm great, you know. Still beavering away on Radio 4.
 (Chuckles) Yeah.
 Hey, you look Fran-tastic.
 You sound well. Oh, thank you.
 Well, I hope so. I'm doing the shipping forecast this evening.
 That's...good.
 Well, I suppose I'd better shuffle off before I buy something.
 I'm voracious at the moment, Fran. I seem to be swallowing books whole.
 LILTING ROMANTIC MUSIC RISES Seem to be devouring them.
 I'm ravenous. Anyway... RECORD SCRATCHES
 Here's my number, should you wish to give me a tingle.
 (Babbles)
 Goodbye.
 Arrivederci, Francesca.
 Hey, Genghis...
 It's your cinema night tonight, isn't it?
 Yeah. I'm going to see 'Armapocalypse'.
 Do you want to come? You know I don't think I will, no.
 Fran and I are meeting for drinks, aren't we, Fran?
 Shipping...
 Trying something new - Absinthe.
 You know that one? You know the slogan,
 'the drink that makes you want to kill yourself instantly'?
 Looking forward to that eh, Fran?
 Forecast... Ha-ha! That's right.
 Do you think I should wash my beard?
 I think you should wash it, yeah. And shave it off.
 Nail it to a frisbee, and fling it over a rainbow.
 Alright, what was the last film you went to see?
 Uh...oh, that one, you know, the astronauts...
 What, 'Armageddon'?
 No, no, before that.
 You know the one, at the end he goes,
 "You did it, you finally did it,"
 and then you see the Statue of Liberty on the beach.
 That was the last film you've ever seen, 'Planet of the Apes'?
 Yeah. Amazing effects, you know?
 You really believed monkeys could have meetings.
 Yeah. And you've not been to the cinema since then?
 No, it's all tossycock.
 Yeah, but it's better than staying in and getting mashed every night,
 with no company except the dead bees on the windowsill.
 I like the dead bees on the windowsill!
 At least they don't go out and leave the front door open and get us robbed!
 Don't get judgey with me, Ming the Merciless.
 Listen, show, what's the story with this alarm thing, anyway?
 How does it work? What do you do?
 Right, now...
 You press, what is it, 05 to arm it?
 Yes. You press 05, and then you go out and it'll lock automatically.
 Alright, OK. And then when you come back in,
 you punch in the code and the lock will open.
 First question - when I come in? Yes.
 After I come in? Yes.
 But how do I get in through the locked door?
 Ah! Well, you see, that's the clever thing.
 Oh, right, yeah...
 Uh...could you repeat the question?
 I'm outside. Yep. The door is locked. Right.
 The keypad is inside, so how can I possibly get into the building?
 My fault. Yeah, yeah, I see.
 Uh...um... Yeah...
 Uh...the code!
 Thank you for that. Sorry to bring this up again -
 How do I get IN? The code opens the door!
 I know the code opens the door!
 But how do I get in to punch in the code to open the door?
 OK. For the moment, just tell me the code.
 There was a little man.
 "There was a little man", that's the code?
 No, I didn't actually hear the code
 because he had a little man in his hair.
 Well, the little man in my hair is getting very, very angry.
 What are you talking about?
 He had a Subbuteo player in his hair, I got distracted!
 So essentially what we have here is a security system
 that doesn't let anybody in or out of the building?
 Yes. Yes, including us! Yes.
 We'll get used to it! Oh, right, OK.
 HOW DO WE GET USED TO IT?! What's the problem?
 Look, it's very simple! Right.
 I'm outside... Right.
 The door is locked...
 Now basically, what happens now is that you...
 ..wait a minute, I see the problem here.
 You have to get in to punch in the code.
 Right...
 Is this locked now?
 I can't hear you, Bernard. I'll just punch in the code and let you in.
 You can't...have you locked me out?
 Just one second.
 Yes! Yes!
 You have!
 I know, it's annoying.
 'NO CONNECTION' TONE
 Fran!
 (Hums to self)
 On Radio 4 at 2:30, and now our weekly visit...
 ENGAGED TONE
 Aaaagh!
 Uh...right, uh...
 OK, just relax. Relax.
 I'm starving...where...
 Ah! Ah-ha!
 No, no, no!
 Yuck! Uh...ah!
 Ah!
 Ah, right. "When you find yourself in a desperate situation,
 "you can find edible grubs or roots.
 "Even insects can provide ample nutrition.
 "It's vital to stay warm and have adequate liquid."
 Right.
 "Morale as just as important as adequate hydration.
 "You may find it absurd, but an old-fashioned sing-song
 "has seen many a lonely soldier through a long night in the wilds."
 (Sings) # I'm in the mood for dancing
 # Romancing. #
 Crunchy.
 Excuse me, there seems to be some sort of mistake.
 I brought a drink and some popcorn, and now I have no money.
 That's how much it costs.
 Why, is it special popcorn?
 Does it produce some kind of dizzying high or...
 Cola, please.
 Right, that's the trap set up.
 (Slurs) "Now, wait for rabbit to approach."
 What? Rabbit?
 Where am I gonna get a rabbit?
 "It is vital to maintain radio contact.

 Excuse me, this might sound a bit funny, but could I please have 10p?
 You're joking, aren't you? No, please.
 Please don't be engaged, Fran.
 Don't be engaged.
 Don't be engaged...
 ENGAGED TONE WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO AT THIS TIME OF NIGHT?!
 And after the news, the shipping forecast, read by Howell Granger.
 Eeep!
 Nasty night out there. Yeah, yeah. Freezing, yeah.
 Wouldn't want to be stuck out there.
 A lot of low air pressure, you know,
 came down from Abernethy or somewhere like that and was just...
 Is that right? Now, what can I interest you in?
 Oh, yeah...right.
 OK, I'd like some hardcore pornography, please.
 Alright...
 ..here you are, set in a women's prison - 25 quid.
 Mmm...do you have anything in a town hall, you know,
 where the women guess the weight of the cake and then...
 No. Got one with nurses.
 Yeah...what kind of nurses though, you know?
 The kind with big tits!
 What do they do, though? Are they in administration?
 That's the kind of thing I'd want, really.
 You know, a lot of hospital paperwork and stuff.
 That's very specific.
 Yeah, well, you know, just keep looking, we'll find something.
 Can you turn the radiator up?
 Here you are...
 'Administrative Nurses', 40 quid.
 Sorry, I mean to say SENIOR administrative nurses.
 That's the only thing I'm actually interested in.
 Could we watch it together?
 Maybe we could get a bottle of wine or something...
 Out!

 It's beautiful. Have a feel.
 If you're not eating anything, you'll have to leave the premises.
 THUNDER RUMBLES
 I will do so immediately, sir.
 I will do so immediately...
 ..sir.
 I will do so immediately, sir.
 PHONE RINGS Oh...
 Hello? (Breathing on phone)
 Hello? Who is this?
 Hello? Is this you, mummy?
 (Breathing continues)
 I can hear you breathing, whoever you are.
 You're beginning to test my patience.
 I know there's someone there.
 Right, that's it. I'm hanging up. Don't hang up, Howell!
 Fran?
 Is this you, Fran? Are you alright?
 Are you in any pain?
 Do you want me to come over? (Yelps)
 I'll come over, Fran. (Yelps)
 Do you want me to come? I'll come, Fran. (Rapid yelps)
 I'll come, I'll come.
 (Orgasmic scream)
 Fran! Fran! My God, what's happened?
 Fran?
 (Normal) Hello, Howell. Sorry about that.
 Fran, are you alright?
 Yes, I'm fine, thank you.
 I just...I just caught my... foot in the fridge.
 Oh. Um... Thanks. Goodbye!
 (Sighs)
 Uh, um... Is it still raining outside?
 Uh, yeah.
 Right. Welcome to the thing, whatever this place is.
 OK, can I haaaaaaaaaaaaaave...
 ..uhhhhh...
 WHAT DO YOU WANT? A Mamba Burger.
 A Mamba Burger, please.
 What do they look like?
 It's sort of two layers...
 The wrapper, what does the wrapper look like?
 Uh, it's the red and white, I think.
 Here, there you go. No, no, no.
 Just...this one...
 Alright, there you go. No, no, no.
 I think that's it. (Coughs)
 It has bacon or something on the top there.
 No, that's not it. That one is very nice.
 That's not it. Try it, it's nice. Give it a try.
 That's not it! It'll be nice, have it.
 Give me your quid. Can I get some chips as well, please?
 How many? What?
 Roughly how many? Come on!

 Right, two quid.
 Um, and a Diet Coke.
 BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! No, no, no.
 Coke's off! Coke's off. Here, have some extra chips.
 Can I have a Mamba chilli dog... Is it still raining? No.
 What happened? What happened?
 Oh, you were burgled again. Huh?
 There's nothing left to take. What did they get?
 Well, as far as I can make out, they took the security system.
 Thank Christ for that.
 What's up with him? He drank all our Absinthe.
 (Mumbles) I'm a lonely soldier.
 What are you doing?
 I'm putting a cold flannel on his head.
 Why?
 They do that in the films.
 Where were you when I needed you?
 Oh, yeah, Bernard... uh, something came...up.
 I'm so, so sorry.
 Um, what did you do?
 Oh, just my usual night out, you know.
 Went to see an experimental film where nothing happened for two hours,
 hung out with a pornographer, got a job in a burger bar,
 you know, the usual.
 Bernard... What?
 Bernard, I'm sorry. Forget it.
 No, there's another thing. What?
 (Mumbles)
 What did you do?
 (Mumbles denials) What did you DO?!
 I ate all your bees!
