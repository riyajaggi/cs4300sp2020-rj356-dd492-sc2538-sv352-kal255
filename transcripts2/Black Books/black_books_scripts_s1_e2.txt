 THEME MUSIC
 Hiya.
 Hello.
 Hello. I'm erm...
 Ah, yes, of course. How are you?
 I'm fine. How are you?
 Fine.
 We haven't slept together and you're not here to freak me out.
 No, no.
 It's just that with you being a man, I thought maybe we'd had sex.
 I'm looking for... I'm supposed to be working in a bookshop.
 Manny.
 Fran. What bookshop? The one next door.
 Bernard's bookshop? Yeah.
 Bernard hired you? Yeah, he did, yeah.
 You're working for Bernard? Indeed I am.
 Wait, Bernard - Irish, smoking, drinking - wrahhh?
 Yeah, yeah. Brilliant.
 That Bernard? Yeah, that's him.
 I thought it'd be nice, you know, bookshop, books.
 Mellow - you know...ahhh.
 (Laughs) Mellow?
 Yeah. (Laughs)
 What? (Laughs)
 What?
 Run away!
 What?
 Hello?
 Erm...
 Mr Black?
 Mr Black!
 Am I dead?
 No.
 Who are you? Have I joined a cult?
 No. I'm Manny. You hired me yesterday.
 Ohhh.
 Do you remember? No.
 How was the situation? Had I been drinking?
 (Coughs)
 So, what do you say, huh? What about it?
 You know, the pay's not great, but the work is hard.
 Are you up for it?
 Come on, what do you say?
 I have to say, I think you're being a bit rude.
 Mr Black? Just a minute, just a minute, Miss!
 Just a minute, Miss.
 Do you want the job or not, Manny?
 I'm over here.
 I do apologise, sir.
 Hey!
 Alrighty. What did you order? Lager.
 I got you creme de menthe.
 OK, hear this.
 I like you a lot, Gerald...Samantha. Manny.
 Manny.
 That's the one. I like you a lot.
 Thanks. You're not so bad yourself.
 Don't touch my arm.
 Sorry.
 Erm... Where have you gone?
 I'm here. You're looking at me.
 Alright, yeah. So, what do you want?
 You mentioned something about a job. What would I have to do?
 No, erm...
 It was going to be in the bookshop.
 But I already work in a bookshop!
 No. Do you have anything in an aquarium?
 Er, no, for me.
 Oh, yes, right, of course. Sorry, of course.
 You leaving?
 That's the old woman.
 Bernard Black. Manny.
 So, what do you want?
 You mentioned a job.
 What would I have to do? No, for me.
 Oh, yes, yes, I'm sorry. Very simple, very simple.
 Here we go. Do you want a job?
 Great. Yes. What's great? What?
 Had you been drinking?
 I'd say you'd had a couple.
 The thing is, the thing is...
 (Gasps)
 Wait a second! What time is it?
 Er, half-ten.
 Half-ten? Half-ten?
 I've never been up at half-ten.
 What happens?
 Look...erm...
 Manny.
 Manny, have you ever bought a book at half-ten in the morning?
 Now you mention it, actually...
 No. You see? That would be a world gone topsy-turvy.
 If this were a bakery, this would be late.
 What? I don't want any cheek.
 I'm sorry, son, I made some kind of mistake.
 You obviously don't have what it takes to sell a book.
 People don't want them in the morning.
 Hello.
 I'd like to buy a book, please.
 What book?
 I don't really care. I'm just in a real mood to buy a book.
 Go! Get out!
 Maybe I'll swing by the bakery.
 Alright, a one-day trial, how about that?
 Fine, a one-day trial.
 Fine. One-day trial... Ow, ow!
 PHONE RINGS
 Hello? Yeah, I'm a bit busy at the moment, yeah.
 I'll call you back.
 What's that? "Ow, ow, ow!"
 I used to work a lot with the mobile and it must've done something to me
 because now, just before it rings, I get a sharp pain in my head.
 What's your number?
 0802 421113.
 Would you pass my phone, please?
 Ow! (Laughs)
 That's brilliant.
 Oh, actually... Ow!
 (Laughs)
 Hello? Hi, Manny, it's Bernard.
 The thing is, we don't allow mobile phones in the shop.
 Oh, right. OK? Bye.
 Bye.
 Oh, look - redial.
 Ow!
 What's all this?
 The rules - for the customers. But they apply to you as well.
 'No mobiles, no wigwams...'
 Walkmans.
 'No...snouty car...?'
 This is indecipherable. Look...
 ..it is perfectly simple.
 'No mobiles, no Walkmans...'
 None of that...
 ..or any of the others.
 'Sings, bugger, cack.'
 'Signed, Bernard L Black.'
 Oh, yeah?
 What's the 'L' for?
 Ludwig, you know, Beethoven.
 Oh, right.
 Why did your parents decide on...?
 What?
 Nothing.
 I'm going to freshen up.
 Hello.
 Books, old and new.
 Come on, come on!
 Who are you? What are you doing? I'm just a customer.
 Oh, yeah.
 Lunch! Where the hell is Fran? Alright, alright.
 Come on, lunch. Shall I flip the sign?
 Go ahead.
 Join us, Manny. Tell us all about yourself.
 Well, I was born in London... Stop there, David Copperfield.
 If you're going back that far, we need popcorn.
 Don't mind him, Manny. Go ahead.
 Like I say, born in London, moved around quite a bit,
 saw a lot of army bases.
 Oh, your father was in the army?
 No, just coincidence.
 Sorry, could we do this some other time when I'm not here.
 OK, fair enough. This could be a really lovely place.
 It is a lovely place.
 Yeah, you'd have to wax the shelves
 and get rid of whatever it is that makes you stick to the floor here.
 You're supposed to stick to the floor there - I like it like that.
 Stops children running around.
 Er, seal the floor, stop that rising smell.
 And you do know you've got mollusks on your pipes?
 What of it? Well, it's just that...
 ..traditionally, they live in the sea.
 Er...put in a few more standard lamps.
 Why didn't you just say you were gay?
 What? I'm not.
 But you're interested in lamps. Lamps.
 Yeah, but I'm interested in women.
 And lamps.
 I thought you were actually. Gay, I mean.
 So did I for a bit.
 Then I found out about the prohibitive standards of hygiene.
 And all that dancing!
 Oh, erm...
 Just look at this bastard.
 That's right,
 that's right, we're having lunch, come on in.
 Look at him, look.
 What do they want from me? Why can't they just leave me alone?
 What do they want from me?! They want to buy books.
 Yeah, but why me? Why do they come to me?
 Because you sell books.
 Yeah, I know, but...
 What? I'd like to buy a book.
 (Sighs) Here's one.
 No, I was... This one's very, very good!
 Oh, is it? Yes!
 You'll laugh, you'll cry - it'll change your life.
 Â£5.99. Alright, OK.
 My change? Can you come back later?
 No, I'm not coming back this way. Where do you live?
 17, Galecksie Gardens.
 OK. Now, go there and await my instructions.
 Where's he gone?
 Oh, I thought he might like to have a look at your spare room.
 Why? Oh, you know, if you...
 ..want him living with you all the time.
 Are you insane?
 He's great, Bernard. What's wrong with him?
 He's trouble, is what he is.
 He's... I can smell it a mile off.
 He's got all sorts of fancy notions and he...
 Do you know what I saw when you weren't here
 and you couldn't have seen it? He was...
 He was sucking his trousers and laughing!
 That's a lie, isn't it?
 No!
 No, don't. I made it up.
 Come on, Bernard, you'd be crazy to let him go.
 You need someone normal around here.
 Normal? He's normal, is he? What am I then?
 You're a freak, Bernard, you know that.
 Yes, I know.
 But I have rights!
 This is what you've needed for he past five years.
 I'd better get back to the shop.
 Bye, Manny!
 You there, Lord Of The Rings,
 let's talk about how this whole one-day trial thing is going anyway.
 OK.
 At the moment, you're fired.
 Oh.
 So, it's not going that well. No.
 What's that?
 It's a bottle of wine to celebrate if the first day went well.
 Welcome back on board!
 These are your accounts?
 Yeah.
 Might be the odd gap here and there.
 Yeah, there's a gap where there should be accounts.
 That's the gap I can see -
 the big account-free gap between page one and page 210.
 Oh, well.
 Accounts - who cares?
 URINATES
 There's a thing here - 'Takings Â£370.'
 That's good.
 Yeah, but your outgoings were over Â£1,200.
 Well, whores will have their trinkets.
 I can't take care of every little thing around here, it's mayhem!
 FLY BUZZES
 FLY ZOOMS PAST
 BUZZING STOPS
 You see?
 So, you and Fran...? Yeah?
 Do you ever...? What?
 You know. What? No. What?
 Have you ever...? What?
 Have you...you know...? Have you?
 What? Together. Have you ever...?
 What? Just say it, man, will you?
 Have you ever had sex? You don't beat around the bush!
 Well?
 Yes. I think so. Hm?
 I'm not sure.
 What happened? Well...
 ..a few New Years ago, I woke up and I was there. And so was she.
 And so were our friends -
 the genitals.
 All six of us were there.
 Six...?
 Oh, yeah. And...none of you can remember what happened?
 No, no. Well, I did for a while.
 I think so. Then she made me block it out.
 That's it. She remembers and I'm not allowed.
 Christ, customers! Why didn't you lock the door?
 We can make some money. But they're students.
 Yeah, but students read books.
 Well, they pretend to. They're students.
 I don't know, it sounds dangerous. I don't like it.
 Well, look, give it a chance, right? And remember this was my idea.
 OK, right.
 MOBILE RINGS
 Hi. Yeah. No, in a bookshop.
 No, no, bookshop.
 BOOKSHOP!
 DISTORTED RING TONE
 These things are really well made.
 RINGING PERSISTS
 RINGING STOPS
 Oh, that felt really, really good.
 I'm surprised we sold anything after that.
 What about you following them round?
 People want to be left alone in a bookshop.
 Don't you think I can do this job?
 No, I don't. Alright...
 ..I bet you I can recommend and sell a book to this bloke here.
 Tenner. You're on.
 Hello... WILL YOU LEAVE ME ALONE!
 I'm sick and tired of being hounded by salesmen in shops.
 I'm browsing, alright? Browsing!
 And at the end of it, I might buy something, I might not.
 But you will not influence me one iota!
 Not one jot. Now I've finished with you, you may go!
 Best of three?
 I'm going out, I have to take some clothes to Oxfam.
 OK.
 I usually lock up.
 Ah, well, now I'm here, it's different.
 Yes, it's different.
 Wait, wait, what are you...? What?
 Why are you locking the door?
 I usually lock the door.
 But now I'm here, it's different.
 Yes, it's different - I've never locked anybody in before.
 Wait! I can mind the shop for you while you're out.
 Oh. Oh, OK.
 Psst! Has he gone?
 Er, yeah.
 He's gone, everyone!
 (All cheer)
 Where's all the books?
 What? Where's all the books?
 Oh, these have been sold.
 Oh, Jesus!
 Do you know what that means?
 It means I have to go and ring the ordering place -
 and you have no idea how incredibly boring and complicated that is.
 Hello? Is this the place you order books from
 for when you want to sell them from your bookshop?
 I don't know. I don't know!
 No. Can you just send me some books?
 Oh, God!
 Hello, hi. Who am I speaking to? Katie, hi.
 Yeah. Can I get The Full Austen, Complete Trollope, not you (laughs)
 Er, Penguin editions, the new editions, yep.
 Tolstoy? OK, fling a few in.
 Alright. OK, then. Yeah, yeah.
 (Laughs)
 OK, fine. See you, bye.
 Manny, I think it's about time you and I had a little chat
 about this whole one-day trial thing and how we think it went.
 Alright. I think it went very well.
 You sold a lot of books, you got on very well with the customers...
 Thank you.
 I'm going to have to let you go.
 What? But I sold a lot of books, I got on well with all the customers.
 It's not that kind of operation.
 Oh, Fran, just wanted to say...
 Hi, Manny. I just wanted to say that I really enjoyed our chat...
 Well, actually, Fran, the thing is, I just popped in to say goodbye.
 Goodbye?
 What are you talking about?
 What did I do?
 GLASS SMASHES
 What did I do? Did you tell Manny he was fired?
 You nearly hurt me in the shoulder. Did you?!
 Yeah, a bit.
 SHOUTING
 Manny, can you come inside?
 Do you want to work in the bookshop?
 Yeah, alright.
 There.
 He likes you.
 Ow. Ow. What? What?
 Ow! Ow! What? What?
 Ow! Ow! Ow! Argh!
 Argh!
