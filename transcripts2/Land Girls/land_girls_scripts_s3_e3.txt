 Joyce is perturbed that John is still distant though Dr. Channing is helping him recover his memory as he relives his escape from France helped by a young woman called Lian. Lady Ellen and Dr. Channing end up in bed and plan a life together so that she is shocked when a policeman tells her Dr. Channing is a suspected collaborator. Connie tries to replace an item Danny has stolen from a local shop and is almost accused herself though she is saved by Henry's intervention. The incident brings to light her past criminal life with Danny but Henry is forgiving and Connie tells Danny to go back to London. Iris is caught up in the Storeys' vendetta against the Tuckers when Vernon's thuggish son kills a lamb she was weaning. Esther realises why she is being sick - she is pregnant by Vernon Storey. Fred Finch,back home,offers to accept paternity but,after Vernon suggests she move in with him,she is appalled and has an abortion,which leaves her faint and bleeding.

 MEN SPEAK IN GERMAN MEN SHOUT IN GERMAN WHISTLE BLOWS GUN SHOTS Who was it? I couldn't see. Try and focus. 'I don't know who they were.' I don't know where I got the satchel from. People are still missing. You have to recall what happened so we can find them.

 Shh. SOBBING Stop it. Continue. He's not well. He's remembering. You're upsetting him. Leave us! No more! No more! HE SOBS Oh, erm... Can you go somewhere else? Eh? Erm... There's a woman in the village and... and she reckons she can lay her hands on some gumboots. So she's coming here to talk about selling them. What's wrong with the kitchen?

 There's too many distractions, there's people coming and going. Well, if you need an expert negotiator... I don't. I just want some privacy. Oh, right. Just leave it, Fred. Well... Just LEAVE it! Just, just leave it. All right. He set light to the paper, I couldn't save it all. What was on it? Numbers, letters. No words ... none that I recognised, anyway. Code? Did you get a proper look at him? He had his back to me. Long coat, hat. That could be any number of people. You say he took the suitcase with him? I couldn't see what was in it. Maybe a radio. Maybe not. What were you doing on my land? Taking a short cut home. It's not a short cut. I came here to report what I'd seen. Thought you'd want to know. Thank you. I'll take care of this. Put me through to the police. I don't do discounts, that's what it costs. How did you hear about me? Everyone round here knows you. How long will it take? Not long, but it takes a while to recover afterwards. Does it hurt? Yes, but the pain goes away. Most people find that better than the alternative. Is it for you? Doesn't matter that you're older. Works just as well. And I keep my mouth shut. You won't go hearing any whispers. A week from now, it'll be like nothing ever happened. Martin. Here. What's that for? Shelves, they're broken. I want you to go to Mr Mortimer's and buy some new brackets. What if they cost more than that? Have I taught you nothing about the art of haggling? Hm? FRED CHUCKLES You know where I am when you've decided. Penny! Penny? Did you get them? Eh? The boots. No, they were too expensive. I know. What? I know. I made one stupid mistake. How long will I have to keep paying for it? Let me help you. You can't. We've, erm... been like a big family in this house, haven't we? Our sons, land girls, Chamberlain. Like any family, there's been times when I've wanted to throttle every single one of you! There's also been times when I would have moved mountains for you all... like you were my own flesh and blood. Except Billy, who IS my flesh and blood. Not that I wouldn't move mountains for him, but things were on a clearer footing there, if you know what I mean. FRED SIGHS Let me be the father. Well, I'll say I'm the father, then nobody needs to know what really happened, eh? I mean, everybody makes assumptions, don't they? Me and you living under the same roof and all. SHE LAUGHS Yeah, sorry, why would you want anyone to think you'd been with me? I'm not laughing at you. You are a good man, Frederick Finch, no matter what they say. Why? What do they say? Look... this is my problem, not yours. I saw her leaving. Hettie Foster. Don't go down that path. Please. I haven't decided what I'm going to do yet. What she does... it's not safe. It's butchery. I'm married. When my Stanley comes home, what then, eh? It's not worth risking your life over. The shame, Fred. You're a man, you can get away with these things. I'm not 17, I won't be forgiven. What about Martin, eh? How will he cope if something happens to you? Think about it. Yes? Need some brackets. What type of brackets? Shoulder or lug? Wooden or metal? Structural or ornamental? Mr Finch just said brackets... for shelves. This is a professional establishment, perhaps you'd be better at the sweetshop? Good morning, sir. Finish serving your customer. Oh, yes, I have. What can I do for you? I need... something pretty specialist. You reckon you might be up to it? You'd struggle to find a better stocked establishment in the whole of the country, sir ... even in these troubled times. Only last year, I was the recipient of a prestigious Medal of Excellence from the British Association of Hardware Suppliers. Can't argue with that. It's my lighter. I brought it back from active service. Oh, you truly are a hero, sir. A Yank gave it to me for saving his life. The pin's gone, needs replacing. I'm sure I can help you. Well, he'd had it specially commissioned from a rare metal. I'd like the pin to match. That won't be a problem. What is the name of the material in question? Flibbleanium. BOY SNORTS Who's "LL"? Don't know, maybe I bought it. Or stole it! I'm amazed you managed to carry one cigarette back without smoking it. Are the pains worse today? Doesn't matter. No, it does. The doctor's pushing you too hard. I'm starting to remember. That's all that matters. Just leave it. Lady Hoxley? Yes, Joyce? It's about John, he's starting to get some memories back. That's excellent news. It is, but I'm not happy about the way Doctor Channing has been treating him. He keeps pushing John to remember what happened. Doctor Channing is a professional, Joyce. I think he knows best. The formalities for the hospital using my property. I gather you're going to be here a while longer. So it would seem. It's not what we in the trade call a common material. Mum's got a bracelet made of it. Perhaps it goes by another name on these shores? Well, you're the expert... apparently. You idiot! I should ban children from this shop. I'm not a child. Pretty shoddy outfit you're running here. Been looking everywhere for you. You could have told me. What? That she was being taken away. Penny. What, she's gone? You didn't know? I must have left the stall open. I'm SO sorry. I'll go and look for her. No. Get that lot out. We might be able to use some of them on Storey's farm. Stay there. Who are you? Brace yourself. This better be good. Relax! Just talking to my new friend here. What's that? Oh, it's a long time since we've been this close. Hm, not long enough! This is Mortimer's. We borrowed it. Take it back! It's not worth anything. That's not the point. He deserves to lose it. If you could see the way he treats his customers. Yeah. Martin, go home. No. Do you want me to tell Esther what you did? I'm supposed to buy brackets. That's not my problem. Scram! See you around, kid. I don't want him mixed up with you. You should go, Danny. Not while you're still here. What do you want? I've been sent to get some essentials. Give me... some of that. How much? Connie! That's enough. Pick it up. If we fight, this will never end. Take it, or I'll do you anyway. And then what? One of my lot'll come after you and so on, time and again. No more, Walter. Look... I want that lamb back. It's important to Iris. Poor girl, she's hardly any age, she's already seen enough trouble. I'm offering you a truce. You can help me end this, before we both wind up dead. Your brother cracked half the bones in my old man's body. Tell me where he is. I don't know where he is. LIAR! Look, he could be anywhere. Well, then YOU go to the police. Tell them you did it. What? Someone has to pay. I'm not going to do that! Then tell those girls to watch their backs. No more violence, Walter. Why would I nick your stupid medal? To sell it. It's a bleeding fake! Are you going to stand there and let this common thief slur...? D'you hear what he called me? I don't reckon you even won it, bet you made the whole thing up. An outrageous allegation! Perhaps we could all... Who gives awards to hardware shops? Connie! The British Association of Hardware Suppliers is a nationally respected organisation! Not to anyone with half a brain! How dare you?! DESIST! You feeling all right, Vic? I'm fine. I think there's been a misunderstanding here. Connie, what were you doing with Mr Mortimer's award? Straightening it. And what did you learn about it? That it's very prestigious and probably worth a lot of money. Satisfied? Excellent! I'm glad we cleared that up. Better get back to the farm. Er, Connie... You going to walk me? Oh, probably not, bet you're busy, ain't you? See you later. What were you doing with Mortimer's award? Straightening it. You know me, everything has to be in the right place. Sends me potty if it ain't! No, I hadn't realised that about you. Hm, famous for it! Why did it need straightening? Martin knocked it. Martin? He was in the shop. I didn't see him. Before you arrived. But I was right behind you. It was me. She was putting it back for me. Got light fingers, haven't I? Can't help myself. Connie caught me. I didn't realise you knew each other so well. How long have you known each other? Just since you introduced us. I'm not an idiot, so, please, don't treat me like one. I'll, er, leave you two to talk. Seems like you've got a bit of catching up to do. Is he your man from London? So, has this all just been a game to try and humiliate me?! No. He's in the past. Clearly, that's not true. My life is here with you now. Henry! Please, don't follow me. MAN SPEAKS FRENCH There were others. The ones who saved you? I was scared. I didn't know who I was, how I'd got there. Tell me about them. There was a woman. What was her name? 'Shh.' Calme-toi, calme-toi. Ca va aller. Tu es en securite. I don't remember. Where are you? Some kind of cellar, a basement, maybe. Try and be more specific. It was dark, lit by candles. I was afraid, confused. Just concentrate on where you are. No, I don't want to talk about it. What happened there? They didn't believe me, they thought I was a spy, wanted to hurt me. Il va tous nous faire tuer. Il est blesse! Il a besoin de nous. C'est la comedie. Je ne te laisserai pas tuer un innocent. C'est clair? Tu ne touche pas! All right. Well, we'll just leave it there for now. Two visits in one day, people will talk! How is Flight Sergeant Fisher? He's doing very well. I heard. You've been talking to Joyce? His memory is coming back because he's ready, and it's important that he doesn't put up barriers that could slow his recovery. I trust you know what's best. Why don't I ask Joyce to sit with him and write down anything he remembers? He might find that less distressing than talking to me. Yes, she'd appreciate that. You look exhausted. I've been up all night. We had some people come in just after midnight. Well, you should get to bed. I wouldn't sleep. Then you should take a break. I know just the thing. KNOCKING ON DOOR Well? Where are you going? I can't stay here and do nothing. She'll turn up. You don't know that. It's... not your fault. How can you say that? Everyone makes mistakes. I'm an idiot. A stupid, useless idiot. Come on, then. Hello, love. You all right? Is you having a baby? Who told you that? Farmer Storey, he was here. Well, you didn't believe him, did you? How could you? With him? What will Dad think when he gets home? Martin, listen to me, I'm not having a baby with Vernon. He made it up? Yes. Why? Because he's a nasty, spiteful man and I don't want you going near him again, do you understand me? You're driving too fast. Relax! I'll relax when you slow down. They build them to go this speed for a reason. Lawrence never felt the need to drive so recklessly. Oh, really? Thought you might have had time to calm down. I'm very busy, actually. Yeah, you look it! Please, I want to confess. This isn't a Catholic church. I didn't mean to God, I meant to you. I always told you I wasn't vicar's wife material. I'm fully aware that you've experienced a... broader spectrum of life than I have. You mean I've been around a bit? No. It's true. I didn't know how I'd survive when I left the home. Turns out if you smile and show a bit of leg, someone'll always pay your way. I see. No, you don't. The others, they just wanted one thing. But Danny, he looked out for me. I'm not saying this to embarrass you, Henry. I want to be honest. Why the change of heart? With Danny, it was always exciting. We'd find someone with a bit of cash, then go to work. Tits and teeth, that was my job. How resourceful. But then things got out of hand. When I got here, I told the girls he was married cos it was safer than the truth. We got mixed up with gangs, it wasn't fun any more. Well, I certainly can't offer you thrills like that. That's what makes you special. For you, life is about something real. I don't want to be that girl I was in London any more. I don't care what you used to get up to. I didn't ask you to marry me cos I thought you were a nun. But you looked me in the eye and you lied to me... and that... I cannot forgive. What, you've always told me the God's honest truth? Yes. But we're supposed to be getting married. Yes... we were. Were? Thanks for letting me know. Oh, she's just stuck, no damage. Come on, nobody's hurt! You were careless. Not safe and dependable enough for you? Not boring enough for you? I'm certainly still not posh enough for you! Come and help me dig the wheels out. No. Afraid you'll get your hands dirty? As long as it takes me away from you, I'll do whatever's required. And please take that filthy grin off your face. Why? I never thought I'd see you like this. You know nothing about me. I can tell you everything you've done in the past 20 years. Your whole life is a series of routines and traditions to stop you feeling anything. It's who I had to be. That's not the woman you were. Not who I knew. This isn't who you should have become. Do you know what I've thought about you for the past 20 years? What? Nothing. You never once crossed my mind. We should stop, we're not going to find her. You can't go that way, there's traps. She might be caught! Get off me! No, it's dangerous. It doesn't matter what happens to me. Look... she's not out there. You don't know that. SHE SOBS She might be hurt, afraid. What if something happens and I could have stopped it? How could I live with myself? She's the only thing in the world I'm responsible for... and I've let her down. SHE SOBS Look... Don't worry. I'll make it all right. I'll make it all right. A truce? I told Frank to go to the police. Tell them he did it. If we can't get his brother, he's the next best thing. And what did he say? He's got no choice. He wants this to end. And how am I going to get justice from that? What? I wanted to make you proud. You could never do that. KNOCKING ON DOOR May I take your coat? A drink, then? How did you find out? Gulliver, she's telling everyone. Of course, she doesn't know that it's mine. Not yet. (You had no right speaking to Martin.) He was going to find out the good news soon enough. I will never admit to what we did. So... what will you say to that husband of yours, then, when he gets out? I mean, IF he ever gets out. He is alive. Don't tell me the thought hadn't crossed your mind. All those terrible arguments you could avoid if he doesn't make it back. I came here to tell you don't ever speak to me or my family again! Are you... feeling guilty that you'd enjoyed it, Esther, is that why you sent your lapdog to beat me? I didn't ask him to get involved, and I don't want anybody knowing about us! You can't support a baby. You know, they'll not let you work once they know you're pregnant. I'll find a way. A year from now, you're going to be hungry and alone... but it doesn't have to be like that. I can help you. That won't happen though, will it? Now, you are going to need time, aren't you, to look after our baby? You can't do everything on your own! Live here... with me... and you'll never want for anything. I said yes to your solution once before and look where that's got me. Yes, Martin got the operation that he needed. I will never admit this child is yours, and I'll keep it away from your poisonous influence until my final breath. I want you to know that. I'll never give up, Esther. There were five people, all men... and one woman, who found me. Was she... Was she pretty? No. Well, I owe her everything for saving you. She must have been a good person. The satchel. They gave it to me. They told me where to go. Oh! I don't remember this though. 'What is it?' Do I look sophisticated and French? Maintenant, Liane! Put it down. Why? Put it down! What's wrong? Nothing. Tell me. Did you interrogate me like this when we were together? We're still together. Where do you want to do it? My room, it's out of the way. Upstairs, third on the left. Please. I don't have any choice. Say it's mine. I'll deal with the consequences. I can't let you do this. If you care for me, you'll understand. I don't understand. Please. It's for the best. In my whole life, I've had no better friend than you and I need you more than ever now. I know what I'm doing. Will you keep the girls away until we're done? KNOCKING ON DOOR Wait. I came to apologise. I'd like you to leave my room, please. Are you sure? Yes. No... Richard... 'Scuse. Er, sorry. What's your problem? Er, mice in the bedrooms. Yeah, made a terrible mess, had to gas them. It won't be safe for people for a couple of hours yet. Mice? Yeah, little brown animals ... four legs and a tail? Yeah, I don't give a stuff about mice. I want to get to my room. I said... no. Conkers. Beg your pardon? Conkers, you know, from a tree? Yeah, I know what a bleeding conker is! A fortnight ago, I told you I'd never skipped off school. That wasn't strictly true. When I was 12, I lost a particularly fierce match of conkers to my nemesis, Andrew Biggins. The following day, I missed Latin so I could go to the woods and gather the freshly fallen weapons before anyone else, and then I demanded a rematch. I didn't want to tell you the truth because... well, I didn't want you to think less of me. I'm sorry. I'm not perfect. Only human. You're off your rocker, you are! Did you win, then? Sorry? Conkers, the rematch. No. NO! He thrashed me... again. SHE LAUGHS I'll do it. But there's a condition. You leave those girls alone and you don't go near Iris again. Not ever. We end this here and now, what do you say? I'll put it back in the barn. Take Iris there this evening, set her mind at rest. Is she all right? She just needs rest. We should get back. Well, just this once, the world can wait for us. It won't do, avoiding your duty to be with me. I can't think of a better reason. I know I became a doctor to heal people... but sometimes, it feels as though I just patch them up so they can be torn apart again. Your work is important. Oh, I know that now. Now I've finally remembered what the point of all the blood and tears is. You. Your beauty, your spirit... these are things that should never be crushed. Whatever horrors the enemy throws at us, knowing there's someone like you in the world... makes the fight bearable. I used to go to events I thought you might be at. Sit through interminable speeches and formalities... in case you were there. You never were. No... I'd always check if you were going first. Oh. Think of the life we might have had. Think of the life we can still have. I was expecting you a long time ago. Been busy sorting out the mess you made. I want you to go. You don't belong here. Neither do you. I told you, I've changed. People don't change. They just find new ways to make the same mistakes. Not me. You lied to your fiance. Manage to talk your way out of it? Persuade him it won't happen again, like you have with so many men before? Things are different with him. Until the next time. We both know you'll never put that fire out baking cakes for the parish council. So why don't you come and sit on the bed? They're good people here, they deserve to be left in peace. All right. One more job and I'll go. I don't believe you. There's a petrol lorry, comes down the Helmstead Hollow Road every week. Only has a driver and one guard. We'll be rich. All these years, and you never once listened to me. I said no, Danny. You know the game. There'll be consequences. No. This stops here. I'm not playing any more. I'm sorry. I want my John back. He saw things in me that no-one else even bothered to look for. He made me sparkle. I can't be that girl without him. I don't know if I can ever be that man again. You're not baking, are ya? Well, I knew you wouldn't be up for it, eh? So I thought I'd help out. Make a pie. You've got about a week's rations in there! Well, it'll be a big pie! You shouldn't have got out of bed. Ah. Well... I had to, I couldn't call for you. Oh! Ah! Ow! Esther, what's wrong? Oh! Ah! Oh! I don't know. I don't know! Ah! Inspector Finton West, a pleasure to meet you, Lady Hoxley. Good evening. Oh... Thank you. You telephoned the local police earlier. Oh, was my information of use? You have a Dr Richard Channing working here? Yes. What do you make of him? Most agreeable. I'm informed you've already signed the Official Secrets Act. Why are you here, Inspector West? We have reason to believe Dr Channing may be collaborating with the Germans. Just check one more time, they often find their way home. Really? SHE SCREAMS I just think I need to lie down. Yeah. Esther? ESTHER?! I'm coming in, I don't care what you say. Er... Go get help! NOW! CONNIE! Esther? ESTHER! Subtitles by APOLLO www.addic7ed.com
