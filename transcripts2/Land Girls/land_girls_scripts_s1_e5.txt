 Land Girls (2009–…): Season 1, Episode 5 - Destinies - full transcript 
 Billy marries Bea, having convinced himself that she is not using him and they love each other. John Fisher attends the wedding, as does Adam, with whom Annie is now in love and prepared to ask her husband Harry for a divorce. Bea is disapproving, given that her sister's marriage to Harry got them away from an abusive father. Lawrence tells his wife he is leaving her for Nancy. She tries to bribe Nancy with a hundred pounds and tells her Lawrence was not a war hero. However, when an increasingly deranged Tucker accuses Adam of sabotage after a faulty grenade explodes and points a gun at him, Lawrence intervenes and is killed. Nancy leaves the farm,having made it up with Joyce. Annie is shocked to find that Harry is disfigured and an invalid but nevertheless tells him that she wants to move on.

 The Women's Land Army is three times the size it was in the last war. These girls are a great success on the land. They love their work. In fact, the only complaint from farmers is they will keep on getting married. Mummy's getting married! Mummy's getting married! Mummy's getting married! Well, it wouldn't be happening at all if Lady Hoxley hadn't let you stay at the farm. Mummy's very lucky, isn't she? Yeah good old Lady Hoxley.

 Didn't stop her drumming you out of the Land Army, did it? I'm happy to be a farmer's wife. I think you'll find it's farm hand's wife. - What? - Puncture the girl's dreams, why don't you? You know, if your mouth was any bigger, it'd meet round the back. Where's Annie got to? Well, she went into Condover to get some lace. I know, but that were ages ago. I don't understand her not telling Harry about the wedding. If she doesn't write to him, she can't tell him anything, can she? Yaeh, sell... that's none of our business, is it? No, but if that were my John in a foreign hospital... Then we'd all know about it, wouldn't we?

 What's wrong with her lately? 12 weeks and I haven't forgotten a single detail of your face. It's good to see you, Adam Blackfield. It's nice to see you too, Annie Barratt. Shall we shake hands? I think that's the done thing. So, how are the preparations? Oh, it's a madhouse. I've never seen Bea so excited. I told her you were coming up for the wedding. Is that all you've told her? I could hardly tell her the truth, could I? She is your sister. She's also not very good at keeping secrets. Monday is dinner with the Willingdons, Tuesday, the PoW fund-raising event in Condover, Wednesday... that journalist is interviewing you about your military career. Why must you fill up every day with activities? I'm not some distant aunt coming on a visit. And most importantly, tonight we're playing bridge with General Yates. I can't tonight. - I've got plans. - We have plans, Lawrence. Please. Of course. Nancy? Nancy? I thought you'd forgotten I existed. Well, have I missed something? Well, obviously not me. I've not seen hide nor hair of you for ages. That is not true! I just couldn't get away. I waited every night for you this week! I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I'll forgive you if you say we can go for a walk tonight. Lawrence, do not say what I think you're going to say. I can't. It's a blasted bridge evening. Well, can't you get out of it? No. Besides it's the kind... of thing... where one has to have a partner. So's this, in case you hadn't noticed. Where do babies come from, Mr. Finch? Did your father not tell you? He can't very well tell me things from a PoW camp, can he? No, suppose not. Here goes, then. Frederick Finch's Lessons In Biological... ... Thingummyjigs, part one. Now...er... When...when... When... When... When a woman and a man... ... fall in love... ... a baby comes along. And that's it? Well, sometimes flowers and chocolates are involved. So... Bea and Billy loved each other? Ah. Well, technically, it wasn't Bea and Billy. It was Bea and that flashy yank. - But he didn't love Bea very much. - That's why we beat him up. Yeah, but it's tricky... So the baby is Bea and the American's? But now Billy's the dad? Isn't that a bit odd? I suppose it is, yeah. - Didn't take him long, did it? - Just ignore him. Well, well, well! You know what they say about bad pennies, Mrs. Barratt. What are you doing here? Well, that's none of your business, is it? - What's he doing here? - He's up for Bea's wedding. How's that husband of yours, Mrs. Barratt? He's fine. I'd better go and get this lace. - OK. - See you later. It's very good of you to do this. It's only ink and paper. You know what I mean. It's good of you to give me away. You've been a better father than my own dad. Don't you go telling everybody I've got a soft side, I'll never live it down. You know, I remember the night before my wedding day. I were as nervous as a hen in a roomful of foxes. I drank so much to steady meself, I wasn't even certain I was marrying the right woman! I proposed to her under that big tree in the East Field. Do you know, I never, ever wanted to marry anyone else. Bea, erm... Billy... he's not your second choice, is he? What do you mean? Well, you must have known how the lad felt about you from the word go. You've got eyes. I didn't think Billy was interested, all right? Yeah, but you got interested in him didn't you, when you realised no other offers were coming in? That's a terrible thing to say! He might not be the brightest spark, but he's my boy. He's all I got. Look, with Cal, I made a mistake. What about now? The shop doesn't have any lace. Did anyone see you? It's quite nice. Yeah. It's the prettiest end of town. It is now. I never do anything reckless or spontaneous, yet here I am standing in a bedroom with a man who isn't my husband. - My stomach's doing cartwheels. - Mine too. I want you to be certain. This had better be important, Lawrence. It is. I can't live like this. Yes, it must be difficult living in such squalor. That's not what I mean. I'm leaving you, Ellen. I presume this is about the Land Girl? I've known for some time. To be honest, I thought it was very generous of me allowing it to carry on, rather than having her transferred to another farm. Or shot. You let it continue? I was hardly going to let your grubby little affair wreck everything, was I? This is not a grubby little affair! - I love her. - You're pathetic. I can't live this lie any longer! Then I presume that means you've told her everything? You're not going anywhere. You know the silo in the West Field? You've wanted it taken down for ages now. Well, I'll do it, if I'm paid. - I already pay you. - This'll be extra. I need all the support I can get because I've got a family now. I see. Son... Are you sure you know what you're getting into, bringing up another man's child? - Of course. - When you could marry someone else, start a family of your own? That Maureen with the lazy eye in the village, she's always had eyes for you. Well, one eye. You saying I shouldn't marry Bea? She's a young lady, she's made mistakes. What if she's just after a cosy life? I hope I'm wrong. - Just listen to yourself! I'm trying... I'm trying to protect you. Son, I've been here for you all your life and I'll be here long after she's gone. This place is a mess. I want these armaments stashed away. I'll be back in ten minutes, and it better be tidy! You're gorgeous. Thank you for noticing. No regrets? You? I don't normally say soppy things, but you've got beautiful, soft skin. You're surprised because I dig ditches all day? A bit, yeah. Cheek! I was gonna wait for you to be a free woman, but the moment I saw you at the station, I wanted you. When Harry gets back to England, I'll ask for a divorce. Really? - Jimmy's still in there! - Look after him. What's happened?! He's not breathing. What are you doing here?! Did you hear what I said?! Just give us some room! HE COUGHS My chest. Adam, Adam. Come on, come on. Nancy! Nancy, I've been waiting for you to be alone. Don't bother, unless you're gonna tell me that the bridge evening's cancelled. - This is important. - Look, I don't want to hear any more excuses, Lawrence. There won't be any more excuses. I'm leaving her. I can't stand it any longer. When? Tomorrow. I see. I want you to come with me. All those doubting Thomases who said war wouldn't come here, this has proved them wrong. They should have listened to an experienced soldier. And now... we've got collaborators amongst us, traitors. But I'm not going to let the enemy get away with it. Not this time. So I'll see you tomorrow at the church. You will. Lawrence... I thought one soldier was a goner and Tucker wouldn't stop shouting. I'm sorry, look, I forgot the lace after that. Ah, she were very brave, by all accounts. You all ready to go, then? - I'll miss you, Mr. Finch. - I'm still here. Aren't you going to say it back? Well, I'll miss you, Miss Holloway. Not for much longer, eh? All right, son? Of course he is! Give us a hand with that door. Annie, this came for you earlier. So where have you really been all day? Never you mind. Things to do. What is it? It's Harry. He's back. Don't look at me like that. - Why won't you see Harry? - Well, why should I? I mean, it's not as if we married for the right reasons, is it? But he was there for us. He got us away from Dad. And he's changed. And how would you know that? You've read his letters, haven't you? Yeah. And the way he writes, about his feelings, that's not the Harry we knew. No, it isn't. He's injured and he's feeling sorry for himself. You've got to see him. He saved us, remember? It's not that straightforward. Why not? Oi! Oi! - I want to ask you one thing. - What? Where were you before the explosion? Coincidence you were coming back just before someone tried to kill me? What was it? Revenge for what happened to your mother? You're sick. But you and Adam were just friends. You barely know each other. Well, we've been writing to each other for months now, telephoning sometimes. It's been going on since he left. I love him, Bea. That's where I was yesterday. How could you? You knew Harry was still alive. Do you think I'm proud of myself? Do you think that any of this has been easy? I couldn't tell you, I couldn't tell anyone. And now Harry's back. Yeah, and you have to see him. Billy, you forgot your buttonhole. You should be in your suit by now. Plenty of time. Right, then. Do you think Bea sees me as second best? Hey, where's this come from? Something my dad said. Am I being a fool marrying her? Don't be so daft. That girl thinks the world of you. Maybe she'd think the world of any man willing to take her on. Billy! Now, the make-up has been donated by Annie, who provided the cleansing cream, Joyce, who supplied the pancake, thank you very much. Esther, the rouge. And me, who's giving you her red lipstick. But that's your favourite. - I don't need it any more. - Thank you. Thank you both. That was a nice thing to do. Nancy, Lady Hoxley wants to see you. - Why? - Didn't say. Well, is Lord Hoxley with her? Better go and see the old witch. Whatever does he see in such a vulgar little commoner? I didn't intend for this to happen, but we love each other. Don't be absurd. Girls like you fall in love every week. It's been going on for a long time, if you must know. I do know. Your little friend Joyce told me months ago. She told you? Does that surprise you? This stops now. - Do you understand? - It's too late. One hundred pound. It's yours if you simply walk away. Have a drink and thank the Lord that no-one died. It were a faulty grenade, I heard. Cedric. It wasn't an accident. He's clever. Covering his tracks, spreading rumours. I'm a hunter. I know how to trap him. Who? Adam Blackfield. He's come to settle a score with me. He's just got a job over at Condover that's all. Of course, the munitions factory. Dennis, that doesn't mean anything. Dennis! Dennis! This is all a game to him. So you might as well make some money and I'll manage my errant husband. What do you think I am? I think we know exactly what you are. You can keep your money. - Very well, then. - If that's all... Wait. There's something you should know about Lawrence. She is about to tell you that I am not the great war hero I made out to be. What? But your leg... Darling, you have to understand. I was desperate. I was up to my waist every day in mud. You could never dry out. The noise of the shelling, people dying around me, my friends being shot to bits. I couldn't bear it any longer. I took my gun... Darling... Nancy! Annie. You know, I do understand why you can't face seeing him. It's not that simple. No. No, I never said it was. But marrying a man just so you can get away from home, it was never going to blossom into real love, was it? I hoped it would. You've got to go and see him and see if there's anything left of your marriage. And what if there isn't? Well, then you can start to get on with the rest of your life. Nancy! Nancy! Nancy, please! Why didn't you tell me before? I didn't realise a single moment was going to shape the rest of my life. Every day since, I have been living a lie. Well, I know the truth now. And see how it's upset you? I didn't think we had any secrets. You know me. I just want to spend the rest of my life with you. How can I trust you now? Oh, darling, think about what we have. I love you. I'm leaving Ellen. My life isn't here any more, my life is with you. I'm going to come by the farm and I hope with all my heart that you will be waiting. I have missed you so much! You look fantastic. Well, that's the country air! A medal? You get that for just turning up. - Here, when can we be alone? - Stop it! Martin Reeves reporting for duty, sir. Pleased to meet you, sir. And is it true you're a rear gunner? Yeah. Now you're sure Mrs. Ambrose has looked after children before? Relax. Esther says she's like the old woman that lived in the shoe. - Aren't you coming with us, Nancy? - I'll see you there. What did Lady Hoxley say? I'll tell you later. Go on, you're going to be late. How can he do this to me? - Where is he? - Maybe - he's just been delayed, eh? - He's not in the pub. He's probably back at the farm. Stop worrying, Adam's gone to look for him. Yeah. Don't fret, I'm sure you haven't been jilted. What did you say that for? Every time I open my mouth, I'm wrong! Finally he realises! I think I know where Billy might be. - Wait. - No. - I'll come with you. - No, I know what I'm doing! Billy? Billy? Planning to blow up the farm as well? I don't want no trouble. You're a traitor! I'm saying it nicely. Only thing I want you saying is a confession. Stop! Don't be stupid. I was in the Great War. I know how to use it. Move! Inside! Did you get the explosives from the munitions dump? - Come on, you're crazy. - Answer the question! Down on your knees. Are you gonna kill me? You expect mercy after what you did? I didn't blow anything up. I know what you are. Not only are you carrying on with a war hero's wife, you're a collaborator scum as well. I had nothing to do with this. Did you get the explosives from the munitions dump? Answer me or I'll shoot you! What's going on here? I've got a man responsible for the explosion, sir! Come on, Dennis, this isn't the way. But I'm doing my duty, like we did in the Great War, sir. We had to stand up for what we believed in then, didn't we? Give me the gun, Tucker. But we need to make an example, sir. You're not really gonna shoot him? He won't confess and yet we know he did it. What else are we gonna do, sir? But that's murder. We could say he tried to escape. Make it seem like we had no choice. You'll stick by me, won't you, sir? I will not be party to murder. What about loyalty? First you save the Morrelli girl and then you show the white feather to this scum! - Where's your backbone?! - Pull yourself together, man! - If you won't help me, I'll do it myself! - Give me the gun! - Stand back, sir! - Tucker... - Don't come any closer, I'm warning you! - Lawrence? Lawrence, stop it! Please stop! Stop it, please! What are you playing at? I came here to think. Is that all I get? You've made me look a complete fool. Get someone! Use this. I'll get some help. I can't be second best. You're not. I marry you, it makes a decent woman of you and puts a roof over your head. Maybe you'd marry anyone to get that. Maybe some girls would. If I only wanted a roof over my head... ... your dad and Esther already let me stay at the farm, don't they? But I don't know you love me? You have to trust me. Just the same as I trust you. All I know is I love you. And all I've ever wanted was to marry you, Billy Finch. I'll always know that I made the right choice... ... even if you don't. I've always loved you. Ever since the first time I saw you smile. And I always will. I'm so, so sorry. Is that a kiss goodbye? Not if you don't want it to be. Let's get married. Come on! You've got the wrong man. Please just hold on. Lawrence, hold on. Lawrence, I love you. I love you.! Go on. - Ready? - Yeah. - Thank you very much, Andrew. - I'm so sorry. Finally, he was a hero. Is that all you care about? You may leave us now. I can't believe it. - Are you all right? - Yeah, yeah. I thought I was a goner, though. He was completely off his rocker. She looks so happy to be married. I've made arrangements to see Harry. Knock, knock. Finch is ready to take you to the station. Thanks. Listen, I am sorry about telling Lady Hoxley. I'm sorry about John. - Well, water under the bridge, then? - I'd really like that. I can't imagine life without Lawrence. What am I gonna do, Joyce? Oh, love, you just remember him how he was. Cos then they're alive forever, then. It's gonna be strange without you here. I'm sure you won't miss me moaning. Plenty of time for that when you get back. Who said I'm coming back? Right, come on. - Good luck. - Thanks, I'll need it. Quickly now. Squeeze in. Smile! Nancy, see you soon. Look after yourself. Bye! It'll be nice to sleep in a comfortable bed for a few weeks. You'll have to wake at five thirty every day so you don't lose the habit. Take care of yourself. It's always been my motto. Harry? Never thought I'd see you again. They've let me out for the day. Told me not to stay too long, not to overdo it. I had no idea you were so... If you'd written, I might have told you. - I couldn't. - It's all right. You'd given me up for dead, it's bound to have knocked you for six. I don't mind admitting, when you didn't reply, I was scared. I thought you might not love me any more. When you telephoned the hospital... Gave me hope, that's all. It's so stupid. Last time we were here, we spent all our time rowing. - Well, things have changed. - You're right there. The war's over for me. That means I get a pension. And... me doctor says I might be able to come home... Might be able? If you were there to look after me. Oh, it's going to be boring. There are only three trains each day. No-one even wants to come here. Are you stationed at Pasture Farm? Oh, yes, but I'm on compassionate leave. So what's it like, the Land Army? Well, er, it's early starts, cold baths, hard work, sunburn, blisters... - Oh, and this scratchy uniform. - Sounds wonderful! It is. Er, you can catch the farmer if you hurry. Come on. I do appreciate all you've done for us but I'm in the Land Army now. I've made a life here for myself. If you come back home then your war's over too, Annie. But what about my duty? You're my wife, I need you. It's not that simple. I know. Last time I was here... I couldn't wait to get away. This time, I want to stay forever. Well, you can't. You said yourself, you have to go back there. Now you're the one who can't wait to go. - Can you take my case, please? - Well, I would but, erm... Ooh, my bad back. Follow me.
