 In Britain the grain harvest has been gathered over recent weeks, and once again, it is our good fortune to make thanksgiving for a bountiful crop. Helpers have come forward to assist in bringing the harvest home. In addition, there's been the work of Italian prisoners, or perhaps I should say, "collaborators". But there will be need of other volunteer hands to make a 100% job of it. What about you? Bea? Are you OK? - I'm fine. - No, you're not. Look at you, you're shaking. I think it was the rabbit stew!

 Well, no-one else got sick. Maybe you should rest today. I could ask Lady Hoxley. No! She's already looking for an excuse to send us home. Anyway, there's no need, I can work. - Don't be silly. - I just needed to be sick. Really, I feel much better now. Come on. No-one else was there, I couldn't resist. - Oh, and which room was this? - The ballroom. Right, so I can see myself in the big, long mirror opposite, and I've got the drapes wrapped around me like an exotic velvet ball gown! I start imagining that I'm Scarlett O'Hara. Is that from John? You know, remember the dance scene? I'm swishing about to the music in my head,

 then suddenly, I hear a voice next to me... "What on earth do you think you're doing?!" Lady Hoxley? How long had she been standing there? Long enough! - How is he? - Homesick. Have you heard from Harry yet? I would've died on the spot! What did you say to her? Well, what could I say? "Well, I appear to have wandered into a fantasy of my own creation!" Late last night, the Condover airfield was hit in a bombing raid. That's less than 20 miles away. This was a properly camouflaged airfield. How did the Germans know to target it? They got my telegram, then! Someone is tipping off the enemy. Make no mistake, these are dangerous times. If you think you see anyone suspicious, I want you to report it directly to me. And who do we report him to? Be vigilant. The enemy could be closer than you think... Dismissed. Where are you going? Egg duty. - Jammy! - Have fun, girls! Esther...! A word, please. You're not going to work in that, are you? You'll die of heatstroke. I'm just a bit chilly. Right, that is it. I am requesting that you take sick leave. No, don't. I told you, I want to work. You're coming down with something. Anyone else think Tucker's talents are wasted here? He should be advising Churchill, the war would be over in a week. - What's up? - Bea's a bit under the weather today, Billy. If you're not well you should rest. Get your strength back. Would everybody stop fussing? I'm fine! How often do you post the women's letters? Twice a week. I-I've got some to go off today. Good, I want you to read them first. What? I can't do that! From now on, you're to read everything coming in and out. But what right do we have? You heard what I said, people's lives are at stake. That has nothing to do with my girls! They're patriots! All them! Don't be naive, Esther. A sympathiser doesn't have horns and a tail. They fit in, they're popular. Likeable, even. They calculate everything to avoid suspicion. Read the letters. If you find anything, anything at all, you bring it to me. Is that understood? Well, What do I do if they notice their mail's been tampered with? Not my problem. Morning, Sarge. Er, just... Just milking the cows. Nice day for it. Can I rely on you? Yeah. What's he on about? Nothing. And that bucket's filthy! Hello. Just thought I'd see how you were getting on. Make sure you're earning your keep. Gosh, you've caught the sun. It's not painful, is it? - a bit...but I'm tough. - I'm sure you are. Personally can't stand sunburn. Old army trick though, soak a rag in water and vinegar and then dab it all over the body. Lovely! Eau de Chip Shop! Don't knock it, it's all the rage in Paris! Are you all right? I'm fine. I haven't fallen off my horse since I was a child. It was my fault, I distracted you. Not at all, it's this blasted leg. - I can't hold on properly. - Lord Hoxley? I'm fine, really. It's just my pride that's hurt. No, no, no, look, he's limping. Stay there, stay there. Shh, Caesar, Caesar... Ceasar, it's OK. It's OK, boy. It's OK. Oh... Oh, gosh. Come on, boy. Come with me... What is it? I'm glad you asked me that, because one day, my wisdom will serve you well. That, my lad, is carrot whiskey. - Carrot whiskey? - Lesson number one: if you find yourself with too many carrots and not enough gobs to chew 'em, don't waste 'em, ferment 'em. Not just a hat stand, I think you'll find! I've been waiting two weeks for this. It could probably do with a bit longer but, er... I'm not a patient man! The moment of truth! - That'll put hairs on your chest! - Yeah? You've got to grow 'em first! Now, I've got two full buckets in the barn. I think I can flog 'em, but we're gonna need some bottles. Flog it? Who's gonna buy carrot whiskey? Bea... Bea, there's easier work you can do, you know. Are you gonna help me, or what? Bea, slow down. No. - What's got in to you today? - Nothing! Can you just leave me alone? What's going on, Bea? Has something happened? Look, talk to me! - I can't. You'll hate me. - I could never hate you! I'm pregnant. What?! How can you be?! Did somebody force you? - It was that GI from the dance. - Him?! But when? You can't possibly have seen him after...! You're starting to show already! It happened that night, didn't it? You'd only known him five minutes, and you let him sweet talk you into going off alone! What did you think was gonna happen? You stupid girl! I'm sorry, Annie. I'm so sorry. Please. You have to help me. Well, of course I'll help you! I mean, I've tried lifting heavy things but nothing works. You have to help me get rid of it, Annie. I heard you took a fall. That's not like you. Are you all right? It was nothing. Haven't you called Benedict? - No. - Why on earth not? Because I know what I'm doing. Don't be ridiculous, you need a vet. Please, don't call him. Ellen! The man's a butcher! How can you even think of doing such a thing? - I've got no choice! - No, I won't let you. When they find out, they'll send me home. Dad'll kill me! That is an innocent child! You've no right to end its life! What about my life? Don't take it out on me just cos you can't have a baby... Bea... Bea, I'm sorry...! I'm afraid it's not good news. There's a severe fracture to the cannon bone. Worst place. There's nothing we can do. It's a shame, he was a handsome horse. - Wait a minute! - Thank you, Benedict. - Would you mind dealing with it? - Of course. Wait a minute! Don't I get a say in this? If we can take the weight off his leg, surely there's a chance it'll heal. And how, pray tell, do you propose to do that? By suspending him. In a sling. I've seen it done. In the Great War, a general's horse broke its leg in the same place and they suspended it to few weeks, and then it made a full recovery. No doubt the General's horse was young and fighting fit. I admit, Caeser is a year or two older, but he's in peak condition. To keep such a horse inactive and in pain would be inhumane. And impractical. Where were you thinking of dangling him from, Lawrence? A tree? A bridge perhaps? No, I'm sorry, it's very unfortunate, but Caesar simply has to go. - You should shoot me along with it! - What? I said, perhaps you should shoot me along with it! I've got a bad leg, I'm getting on. I'm sorry, but I'd like you to go. Now, please! You can't be serious about this. Nancy... Watch yourself. You haven't seen Bea, have you? Not since earlier. Have you had a row or something? Well, yes, but it's nothing serious. It's just Bea being impossible, you know? Not just a hat stand, I think you'll find! Good lad! You're learning fast! Sort through them, see if any of 'em fit. Lesson number two: you never know when you might need a cork. Hello, there. What's happened to you, then? You need a hand, sir? - Lawrence. Please. - Yes, sir. Thank you. Just, er... That's it, just in here. What's it for? - You wouldn't believe me if I told you. - Try me. Bea? That's...it. How... How big is the horse? Yes, you're right. It needs to be a little higher, doesn't it? Well, maybe if we... No. - Sir, could we just use...? - Just a second, I need to concentrate. If... if we built a scaffold... then maybe... No, see, that'll just take too much time. No, but if we use... What we need to do... is find something on the farm that we can use... somehow. We've got the scaffold with the winch in it for cleaning the well, so if we could extend the legs, then maybe we could make a, sort of, hammock and suspend him. - What do you do in peacetime, Joyce? - Oh, I'm a hairdresser. She's up there. Billy, I'd rather you didn't. - I just want to see her. - Please, I'd like to talk to her alone. And we have... Fish paste! Anyone for fish paste? And this one is... What do you know? Fish paste. You! No talking! Esther? What are you doing out here? I... I-I-I just wanted to bring this. It's such a hot day. I don't want no-one getting dehydrated. - Thanks. Yeah. - I'll see to it. There you are... That's it... Do you think I've hurt the baby? I hope not. Annie, what have I done? Bea. Bea, look at me. Look at me! I've been so stupid, I'm sorry. No. - What I said about you... - It doesn't matter any more. What's important is what we do now. This GI of yours, what's his name? Why? What are you gonna do? I just want to talk to him. - It's no use, I've tried. - What? I've been to the barracks. He won't see me. The cheek! Right, well, I'll make him see me, even if I have to chain myself to them gates! Stand up! Stand up! Yes, you! I'm talking to you! You like laughing? What were you laughing about before? With the English woman? Answer me! What's he saying? - Speak English! - He speak no English. Only Italian. Niente! - Damn! - Do you want me to take a look, sir? No, no, it's all right, thank you. I think I've got it. Do you mind my asking... well, why you're going to all this trouble? Don't you think he's worth it? No, of course I do. It's just, well, people like you don't normally... Don't normally get their hands splintered? - Yeah. No offence. - None taken. My father kept horses. When I was 15, I helped him birth a colt. As a reward, it was given to me. He was so handsome. Headstrong. But more than anything, he was special because he was mine, my first horse. You never forget the freedom of riding your first horse. Never. You know, we are going to have to do more to support this. What happened to him? Your first horse? The Great War. In those days, the army could seize civilian horses to use in the cavalry. When they came for him, I tried to hide him. I foolishly thought that if they took the others, they'd spare this one. They found us, of course. I had to watch them lead him away, knowing that he was destined to charge into a hail of bullets. Pointless. Anyway, Caesar rather reminds me of him. And I'll be damned if I'm going to let him go so easily. Nancy speaks Italian. You've heard her? She's too clever for that. But not clever enough because her secret's out. Just a question of proving it. You tell... You'd better look at this then. Were you planning on showing me? Of course I was. Look, she's a good girl. When is it a crime to speak Italian? Since they declared war on us. I knew it. I knew there was something about that girl that couldn't be trusted. Thank you, Esther. So, Joyce, tell me, where are you from? I'm from Coventry. Really? I say, you weren't there when the...? No. I was in Birmingham visiting my husband. Goodness. But my parents. They were both in the house when the... Well, it's gone now. Everything's gone. I'm so sorry. Now I've just got me husband to worry about. He's in the RAF. All you can do is pray. I know he's doing his duty and I take comfort in that, I do. It's just... Well, he's all I've got. Perhaps God will take that into account. I don't know how you cope. Work hard, you laugh when you can and... Don't dwell on things you can't change. Annie. - Where you off to? - Look, tell your father he can drop my pay if he wants. I just need an hour. Listen, I don't care about that. Listen, listen. If Bea's in some kind of trouble I want to help. She's fine. This is family business. Leave it alone. Please. You'd better mind yourself back there. He might kick. Do you think it's going to be strong enough? There's only one way to find out. Ready? 1, 2, 3. Up! He's off the ground! He's off the ground! We've done it. We've done it. Do you even know what you're looking for? Please, just stay out of my way. But this isn't right, it isn't right. Be quiet. Will you just promise me you won't accuse her of anything. Not yet. You get that letter translated at least? Of course I'll get it translated. In the meantime... I want you to watch her every move. And don't let her go to town. I don't want her talking to outsiders. How am I supposed to keep her here? She's not a prisoner! Just do it, Esther. If she's a sympathiser she's a risk to us all. Excuse me. Excuse me! I'm looking for a GI by the name of Carl Gillespie. Are you here on official business? Well, no, but it's important I speak with him. I can handle a broad bein' ugly if she's got a good caboose. You slay me, Gillespie. I mean, I like a nice rack, but it makes no difference from behind though, right? Let's get a beer. Did you follow me here? If you won't tell me what's going on with Bea I'll find out for myself. I've told you, this isn't any of your concern. You're not the only one who cares about her. I know that. But I'd rather handle this on my own. Handle what? It's the Yank from the dance, isn't it? He's the reason Bea's so upset. They won't tell me where he is. It's a rare English delicacy. Takes years to ferment. Better than warm beer? Of course it is! In the Savoy, they charge five shillings a glass. But for you gents, I'm willing to part with the whole bottle for four. You won't get a better price than that anywhere else in the world. - It's a pleasure doing business with you. - Cheers. And don't let me catch you in here again! How did you do? Good lad! I knew you'd shift 'em. Lesson number three: always remunerate the workers. No no, you don't have to say anything. You've earned it. Off you go. All right, son? Annie! What're you doing here? I could ask you the same question, Dad. So, I have this uncle who works at MGM. In Hollywood? Sure. I'll give him a call about you. You kinda remind me of a young Betty Grable. Isn't that what you said to our Bea? Oh, no, it was Greer Garson she reminded you of. I don't know what she's talking about. I'm talking about my sister. You Yanks are all the same. Thanks a lot. - Which one was your sister? - About three months ago. The dance at the Manor House. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I remember. So, what do you want? I want to talk. In private. Well, that's too bad cos I'm gonna sit here and finish my drink. - Look please, it's important. - Either spit it out or beat it. - How about I shove that drink right up... - Billy. I can handle it! Oh, I get it. Billy here's all bent outta shape cos he's sweet on your sister. Am I right, farm boy? I bet a cute girl like that wouldn't give you a second glance. I can't say I blame her. Fine, if you won't go outside... Are you kidding me? Any one of these guys could be the father. You mean she's... You son of a... What are you and Finch up to? - Answer me! - Nothing. I swear. You won't get into trouble. Just tell me what Finch is selling. You're hurting me! I'll kill you! That's it! Break it up! Everybody out. That's enough. Outside. He's using this grotesque contraption without the slightest thought for our concerns. But what can I do? Lord Hoxley doesn't want me anywhere near the beast. Am I the only one who cares for this animal's welfare? Something must be done. But if it's Lord Hoxley's horse... He doesn't own this property or anything on it. The decision is mine. Now, are you going to do what you're paid for or am I going to have to shoot the horse myself? Is this how you represent your country? Brawling with American servicemen in pubs. Have you no self respect? The Americans came here to help defend us. Is this how you repay them? It won't happen again. Can I go now? You will stand here until I've finished what I have to say! Tucker, I respect what you do with the war effort and that, but I don't answer to you and I never will. Now, if you'll excuse me. I see you've learnt your attitude from your father. He doesn't seem to think he has to answer to anyone either. Not even the law. Perhaps I should have him investigated. Black market trading is a serious offence. - What are you doing? - That's not your concern. Wait, wait. Does Lord Hoxley know you're here? I received instructions from Lady Hoxley. Stand aside. No! I won't let you shoot that horse. I'm afraid you have no choice. No, please! Lord Hoxley! Come quickly! I'd keep running if I was you! I think Sergeant Tucker's on to us. How do you mean? He suspects us for definite. Well, suspecting ain't knowing. That's lesson number 4 by the way: RATTLING You hear that? That is the sound of the little man winning. Remember that. You see, there's always a big man there ready to tell the little man what to do. You couldn't tidy around, could you? You made a right mess with that whisky. - Where'd you get hold of that? - I found it in the barn. You used that for the whisky? I use that for me liquid fertiliser. You don't think... Well, it wouldn't kill anybody. Would it? No, course it wouldn't. Would it? No, no, no. Well, it might just make people a bit sick. But, there's no harm in that, is there? Bea. What happened to you? I met Cal. He hit you? Well, it was an accident really. He was trying to get to Billy. What was Billy doing there? Look, it's a long story. The important thing is that... Cal knows. And...? I'm sorry, Bea. Look, if it's any consolation you're better off without him. Does that mean Billy knows too? I hope you're proud of yourself. You scared the living daylights out of that poor man. He'll never set foot on this land again. Good. Oh, don't be absurd, Lawrence. What about the farm? Who's going to take care of the animals? You? Well, why not? I know a lot more than you give me credit for. Then you should know there's no room for sentimentality. But then that's you in a nutshell, isn't it? You'd rather prolong a poor animal's suffering than do the decent thing. You're a coward, Lawrence. But we both know that, don't we? I should have known you weren't man enough for the job. He defended your honour. Hello. Billy. Bea, where are those potatoes? They need boiling. I'll take them. Nancy, can I talk to you a sec? Me? Sure. Can we go for a walk, please? He wants you to spy on me? - Why? - Wouldn't say. Look, I'm sure it's nothing to worry about. Tucker's not been right in the head since the last war. He don't trust anyone. But I just thought you should know. Yeah, thanks, Billy. Lord Hoxley said that you helped him save his horse today. Oh, I didn't do much. It was mostly him, really. That's not what he said. What did he say? He said he couldn't have done it without you. Lawrence. Lawrence! How could you? What are you doing here? You have no right to be here. Either of you! Sergeant Tucker. Hurry up! That's all of them? Every last one. - Is he following us? - No. Liquorice? Enjoy your walk? - Where've were you been? - Just in the fields. Why? When I ask you to peel potatoes I don't expect you to run off. I didn't run off. I just went for a walk. Well, in future I would appreciate being told. Fine. I'll do the potatoes now if you want. It's too late. I've done them myself. I'm sorry. I know you were fond of that horse. It would have worked. Keeping the weight off his leg. I'm sure... it would have worked. Then why on earth did you shoot him, dear? Seems you're an even worse coward than I thought. He had Billy pummelling from the front, me kicking up the backside and Martin choking him from behind. He's only nine-years-old and fighting in pubs already. I suppose I should scold him. Come on. Who was it? Who's been going through my things? What are you talking about? My books, my clothes, they've all been tampered with. Well, is there anything missing? That's not the point. I want to know who's responsible. It was you, wasn't it? I'm not interested in your stuff. Look, I've seen the way you look at my clothes. What did you do, try them all on or something? Nancy, I wouldn't touch anything of yours if my life depended on it. You stink of vinegar. Stop it! Stop that! I said enough! That's it, Nancy. There's no more trips into town until I say otherwise. Me? What about her? No arguments. You'll do as you're told. That's not fair. Someone's been going through my private things. That's no excuse to be fighting with the girl. But it's OK for Annie and Martin to fight? You should make up your mind. You mind your tongue or you'll miss the film tonight as well. All that money. I held it in my hands for just a few short hours. There's a cruel God up there. Well, look on the bright side, Dad. At least nobody drank the stuff. Hang on, there's only 11 bottles there. Martin? Martin, what are you like, eh? I'm looking for Annie. I need to talk to her. The girls are all up at the Manor House. The interests of our King and Queen and the welfare of their people is a very real thing. The wellbeing of the poorest among us is a matter of concern to the whole Royal family. Her Majesty's made a visit to the LCC housing estate on Hackney Marshes and, of course, it was a great day for the residents. In Union Hills the King inspected one of the aircraft factories and met some of the men working to make Britain supreme in the air. Are you not watching the film? I don't really feel like it. Do you ever feel like you're being punished for something, but you don't know what? All the time. Listen. About earlier... Please, you don't have to explain. I'm so sorry about Caesar. Sorry. I need to speak with you. What about? Please. Outside. Stay and watch the film. I'll be right back. What have you said to her? Annie wasn't the only one fighting, you know. Bea. No. It's Harry. He's been killed in action. Subtitles by Red Bee Media Ltd E-mail subtitling@bbc.co.uk
