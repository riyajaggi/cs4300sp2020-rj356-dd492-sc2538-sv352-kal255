 Those guys could be on us any minute. I will bring back reinforcements! Probably be coming in by bus. We are flying! Beautiful. Ten years ago, a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court... for a crime they didn't commit. These men promptly escaped from a maximum-security stockade to the Los Angeles underground. Today, still wanted by the government, they survive as soldiers of fortune. If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them... maybe you can hire... the A-Team. What are we doin' here? What are we waitin' for? Patience, B.A.

 Face, hold still. Boy, these mosquitoes are killers. - You get him? - Yeah. - Look at the size of that sucker. - Unbelievable! - Uh, do you know the words to... - What? ♪ You are my sunshine my only sunshine ♪ ♪ You make me happy when skies are grey ♪♪ Shut up! What's that noise? - Sounds like a jeep. - Sounds like a supercharged jeep. Sounds like an aeroplane to me. Uh, well, it's probably the guerillas' aeroplane. If that's Murdock, I'm not gettin' in the air with that crazy sucker. B.A., you really, really have to lighten up on this paranoia you have about flying. Hold still, B.A. Got him! That's a monster! Look at that. Mmm! - Thanks, Hannibal. - It's okay, pal. Right. - Why does he always fall on the horn? - Beats me. Shall we? I love to crash parties. Is he down yet? Almost. That-a-boy, Murdock! Ladies and gentlemen... the captain has just turned on the "no smoking" and "fasten your seat belt" sign for taxiing and take-off. Please make sure that your seats are in the upright and forward position... and that your table trays are secured in front of you. Please sit back and enjoy your flight. Let's go, Murdock! Ya-hoo! Yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah! Speak of the devil. This is Amy Allen. Hi. I'm Mitchell Barnes, U.P.I. Mitch just got back from covering the crisis in Lebanon. He'll be in L.A. for a couple of days... and, uh, he wanted to meet the person who filed the story on the Jamestown incident. Excellent, excellent example... - of infield journalistic investigative technique. - Of what? Reminded me a lot of that story I filed from Belgrade in '71. You happen to read that? Ran in Time, Newsweek, Life. I might have. I was a sophomore in high school at the time. I'd love to compare battle notes with you. - What do you say we grab a bite to eat before we hit the Law Spa? - The what? The Law Spa. That's what we wiremen call the courtrooms. Kind of catchy, huh? Mitch wants to sit in on the Caldwell murder trial. You're covering that, aren't you? Well, yeah, but the trial was moved back until 4:00. - Actually, I can't this afternoon. - You"ve got nothing to say about it. It's settled. - Mitch, talk to you later. Okay? - Do you have a phone I could use? - Uh, yeah, on that desk right over there. - Oh, thanks. This is Captain Stewart. Go. I've hooked up with the skirt. We're comin' out. - You guys are really gonna owe me one for this. - Barnes, we've played ball before. Personally, I think it's a long shot, but Lynch seems to think this Amy Allen might be working with the A-Team. - She hired 'em once. - Maybe he's right. If I were working on a story like the A-Team, I wouldn't give it up either. Bet your captain's bars on it. You've got the tailing device, so stick with her. We'll be about a block back. - Time's a-wasting. - Okay. Face, I can't believe it. That was the sloppiest, most unprofessional job I've ever seen you do. I did the best I could. I got you through Customs and over to the church, didn't I? - But why wasn't the bridge dynamited? - Ah, well... Now, look, kid. I like a little shoot-'em-up now and then. It keeps the adrenaline going. But it was not part of my plan to be chased... by the Guatemalan army to the airport. Oh, the archbishop's gonna be real happy. We got him his money back. That'll teach the government to try and throw the clergy out of the country... and then steal their building-fund money. Yeah. You do have a point there. I like working for the church now and then. Insurance against Judgement Day. Knock it off, you guys! Uh... are you having a problem, Murdock? Well, it's hard to tell with these. With these? What do you mean, "with these"? - Where'd you get this plane, Face? - Face didn't scam it. I did. - What? - Well, I-I had to con the passport people. Okay. Murdock, where did you get this bird? I clipped it off of the rental plane repair line. It would be ridiculous for me to assume that it'd been fixed. Of course it wasn't fixed. They start to miss 'em once they've been fixed. - You gotta get 'em before they're fixed. - Of course. Uh, Murdock? What's gonna happen? - Looks like we're gonna crash. - No, come on, really. What's gonna happen? - It looks like we're gonna crash and die. - I'll get the parachute. Four thousand feet and dropping. This thing's got the glide characteristics of a free-falling safe. - Where are we, Murdock? - I don't know. Somewhere in South Carolina. Uh, I think. I've been dead reckoning it. This funny little thing that points and spins ain't workin'. There's just one parachute. I'll jump and go for help. Too low, too late to jump. - He got this plane off a repair line? - Okay! Find a comfy little spot and hold on! Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes your flight. Thank you for flying Miracle Airlines, the only airline where Lady Luck is your co-pilot. Easy for you to laugh. We're probably the only guys to survive an aeroplane crash... only to be killed minutes later by an irate passenger. Another satisfied customer. See, he's not complaining. - Here we go. One, two, three! - Two, three! Oh! I got him, I got him, I got him. Hang on to him a second. - Anybody know how much this man weighs? - God, man! He's heavy! - I ain't knockin' him out no more. - This is the last time I'm carrying him. You think it's easy on this end? I got 200 pounds of gold pullin' me down. Maybe it would help if we took the jewellery off. No. Can't. I think he's got it hooked up to a burglar alarm. Put me down! Put me down! Put me down! Put me down! Put me down. Face, check the rear, see if we lost those guerrillas. Lost them? Where are we? They've been following us for two hours. It's all clear... for now, Colonel... but those guerrillas are tricky. - They could be flanking us up on that ridge there. - Sergeant, how're you feeling? Boy, that concussion grenade... almost put your lights out for good, man. Concussion? Grenade? All I remember is being bit by a mosquito. - Where did you come from? - When I get that figured out, I can drop out of analysis. - Face, take the point. - Anybody want to switch? Face! B.A., take the rear. Murdock, follow me. This don't look like Guatemala to me! Well, it ain't South Carolina. - Pine trees? - South American Chi-Chi trees, but they're related. We decide how much we pay you. Let me tell you something, mister. We got a code among us. We got no time for folks who don't respect our rules. - Ain't that right, boys? - Right. We got a code. It's all agreed, now. - Fire him up, boys! - Yeah! Yeah! Are they doing what I think they're doing? Are they burning that guy at the stake? Since we don't know what's going on, let's run these guys off. Besides... Baby's a little low on ammo. B.A., take the right flank. Face, take the left. Murdock... cover the rear. What are you fellas doin'? You havin' a cookout? Kill him! Return fire! Get out of here or you're all dead! Let's get out of here! - B.A., you all right? - Yeah, I'm okay! - Murdock? - Yeah. I'm okay! Face? Face! His position's been overrun. Those men are after him. Okay. Let's get this guy down. - Give me a hand, Murdock. B.A. - Okay. - You got him? - Yeah. - Ammo report. - I'm out. - I've got five rounds left in my. 45. - I got three rounds left in my. 45. My rifle's empty. Okay, let's get back to the plane. - Plane? What plane? - Sergeant, grab Baby. Bring up the rear. Stay in tight, Murdock, on the point. - Hello. - Get up. Well, I, uh... I guess you caught me. We ain't restin' until every one of 'em trespassers are caught and punished. Every one of'em. Murdock, give me a hand. See if we can get him under this tail section here. We gotta set up a perimeter. Murdock, get some shrouds off that parachute. Set up some trip wires. We ain't in Guatemala no more. Them guys back there was hillbillies. Murdock crashed the plane, didn't he? No! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I simply relocated the aircraft with extreme prejudice... because of a total loss of thrust and lift functions! - You crashed it, sucker! - Sergeant! Now, we did put you aboard this plane. You were unconscious because we took a hit on that truck in Guatemala. Now, Murdock risked his life and flew in and rescued us. - I should be given a medal. - You're both gonna eat medals. I die before I fly! Put it on hold, Sergeant! I'm not gonna stand around and argue. This man is dying! I don't like you guys always lying to me, man. Now, we don't always lie to you, B.A. That isn't fair, and you know it. Boy, that was close. Those Guatemalan hill troops are real tough customers. - What's up? - I'll tell you what's up. I know you guys lied to me. I know you put me on an aeroplane. And I know Murdock crashed it. B.A. Baracus gonna take that lie out of each and every one of your hides. B.A., you got something there. Murdock. Better get those trip wires out, and don't forget the last belt for the M-60. Those guys could be on us any minute. This plane sticks out like a fly on a wedding cake. B.A., you better watch our back trail. I wonder what they got against this guy. "James McDonald... age 54." - He's got three kids. - This guy works for the county. Here's a surveyor's map. They're gonna put a highway in up here. Murdock, come here. Can you make any sense out of this? Yeah. Yeah. That's the peak right there. That's the one we barely missed when we came in. And we almost hit that summit right there. We're surrounded by mountains. Okay, we can climb over 'em and leave him here... or we can stay here and try and keep him alive. - We never left any wounded back in 'Nam, Colonel. - That's right. Okay. We stay. Uh, Hannibal, how are we gonna get this guy outta here? They show movies at the hospital every Thursday night. We get old ones mostly, but some... some are all right, you know? Look, Murdock! I'm on a real short leash here, and I'm getting tired of your crazy rap! Flight of the Phoenix. Last Thursday night they showed Flight of the Phoenix. These guys crash in the desert, and they fix their aircraft by redesigning it. Will you let go of my arm before I get gangrene! Man! I could design an ultralight. It's like a hang glider with a motor. Seats two. I could fly out of here with our patient. You guys could take off. - A motor? - Yeah. - How long would it take? - Depends on how long it takes to get what I need. - With wings? - Flap, flap. Just like 'Nam. And 'Nam was no picnic, believe me." There I was, perched between the U.S. bunkers and Charlie. There were weapons and bullets everywhere. I know what you're saying. "This guy is crazy." But my answer to that is, if you're gonna cover a war, you cover a war. I would've stayed to the bitter end, but my boss wanted me to cover the Middle East. But I guarantee you, by then I saw more action than 90 percent of the G.I.s. - Really? - By the way, who are these friends you're meeting? - Oh, nobody newsworthy. - Hmm. So that's how I came to be in the Middle East for the Six-Day War. Six days? I made it a full week. I knew every tollbooth from Kangnung to the 40th parallel. And they weren't taking tokens, believe me. I mean, your life wasn't worth a dime out there. We're talkin' survival here. You gotta know, the regular troops figured that if my porch light wasn't out... it was at least blinking. But I knew the stories were hidden in that jungle, and I had to find 'em. Is that so? Is this where we're picking up your friends? Guess they're not on time. - What was their E.T.A.? - Around now. Huh. Gee, it doesn't even look like there's anybody here to ask. Well, let's wait a while. I mean, they're always a little bit late anyway. Maybe they got into some trouble. Hey, Face. Come here. "Two 10-inch wheels. - A 10, uh... "What?" - Horsie power. "Horsie power engine. Three bolts of industrial silk." - Are you nuts? - Absolutely and totally. How am I gonna get all this stuff in the middle of nowhere? - You always say you can get anything, anywhere, anytime, - Yeah, but... Think of it as a challenge. How did you get that '53 Cadillac in the jungles of 'Nam? How did you get that '53 Cadillac in the jungles of 'Nam? Professional secret. Of course, he was a lot younger then. Industrial silk. The guy is absolutely incredible. - Come on, mudsucker. Get up and get going. - Sucker... B.A., get a blanket and cover this guy. His temperature's really droppin' fast. Okay, Murdock. I'm gonna take our little country cousins on a decoy operation... lead 'em away from here as far as I can... buy some time. They're used to huntin' rabbits. Let's see how they do with a wolf that bites back. You see, I have what you call your nose for news. That's why I was there when Big Daddy Amin pulled off his coup in Uganda. - I was there when the shah took his hike from Iran. - No need to wait here any longer. Don't think I was just looking for a spa in Czechoslovakia... when the big red machine came over the border. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Hold it! Why, you're a priest! I'm sorry... but I can't keep from laughing whenever I hear that term applied to me. - You ain't a priest? - Ah, I don't know what I am. Why does life have to be so hard for some of us? All my life, I-I've dedicated myself to the Lord... only to wake up one morning and discover I have no inner peace... no tranquillity in my soul... no... no faith. Mister, are you all right? Maybe you oughta sit down. You're such a sweet soul. So innocent and... pretty. Just like... Mary Ann. - Mary Ann? - Mmm. - My name's Louanne. - Really? You know, I've always been kind of fascinated with priests... because they aren't allowed... I mean, they don't... Ah, but sometimes... they do. Oh, no! You and Mary Ann? Sometimes the runner stumbles. Oh, Father, I'm truly sorry. What can I do to help? Well... would you happen to have a gasoline engine? Gasoline engine? You know, for my power lawn mower. You want a power lawn mower? Well, yes. You see, I feel that if I could put my garden in order once again... then it would be akin to putting my internal house in order... and I'd have a chance at another beginning. Hmm, we don't have a lawn mower... - but we do have a power seeding machine. - Perfect. This is the seeding machine. We're not gonna need it till next month. It's, uh, just what I had in mind. Actually, all I need to borrow is the, uh, engine and the wheels. How you gonna do your plantin' if you don't take the whole thing? Oh! Oh, I forgot to tell you. I have a seeder. See, I just lack parts. It would be very selfish to borrow what I don't really need. - Waste not, want not. - Whatever you say. I know it sounds silly, but, Louanne, you must... you must understand. I am a lost sheep... and you... you've helped me to find my way. You can't put the rudder on before the elevator. - Man, ain't nothin' I can't do. - Look, I'm the supervisor here. You ain't nothin' but a nut that know how to fly. You know, B.A., this bickering is so counterproductive. I think that now we're out here alone, just you and me, takin' on the elements, trying to survive... that this would be a good time to... It's Hannibal. It's okay, muchacho. What took you so long? I bought us some time, like I said I would. This thing is supposed to fly? I've got no fear. I'll go up in anything except an elevator. Where are they? I left 'em in a canyon up east of here. There's more than we thought... about 20 of them. B.A., you know those flares we got aboard the plane? You think you could put those together with a... maybe a pipe from the hydraulic system on the brakes... and get us some firepower? Right, right. No problem, Colonel. B.A., there's an old saying... "The best defense is a good offense." You got that wrong, man. A good offense is the best defense. Okay. Have it your way. Thanks. Thanks. - What now? - I have somebody I have to look in on. Okay. Where are we going? I'll let it be a surprise. So this is an insane asylum. I always wanted to do an in-depth on a bin like this. I visited one once in Germany... the Freudian Institute. Met a guy who thought he was Douglas Fairbanks. Shell-shocked. War's unmerciful to the mind. - Mitch, I think I should go in alone. You know what I mean? - No sweat. I understand. It's not easy having complete strangers watch your loved ones bounce off the walls. - Hang tough. I'll be out here if you need me. - Thanks. Murdock. An answering machine. Hi, y'all. Howling Mad here in voice only. This time my body has split, along with my mind. So at the tone, leave your name and the message, and I'll get back to you as soon as my shock therapy's over. Bye. What are you doing inside? You want her to spot us here together? Not that it matters much. I don't think she has anything to do with this A-Team any more. - Wrong. Then what is she doing here checking in with H.M. Murdock? - It's in her files. She's remained friendly with him ever since a while ago when she tried to contact the A-Team. Look, she's a good kid. She just probably feels bad for the guy. Look, she... Great! Now we've lost our bird dog. Wrong. The tailing device is still in the car. And working. This thing is never gonna work. Hey, you want to give me a hand here? Pays to stay fit. So you found us a wheel and a motor. That's right. Not a five-horse, not a seven-and-a-half horse... but a 10-horse, air-cooled gasoline motor, as ordered. Face, I don't know how you do it, but you sure do it good. Well, look, you give me a job to do, I do it. I pool my resources, I consider my options and then I go for it. Sure, it's not easy. There are risks, but I take 'em. - What was her name? - Louanne. - That preacher was workin' with them city boys. - He helped them steal our prisoner. - No! He said he was plantin' a garden and that he needed parts for his seeder. He said that he was becomin' a lost sheep. - All right. We're goin'. - Where? To help the reverend find God. Red Carpet Flight 86 now ready for boarding. All passengers holding tickets will now be on board. You got some structural weakness in the wing struts... and they won't hold if you start any of your aerobatics. Remember, keep an eye on the silks. If it starts to shred, take it down. I didn't know you cared, sweetheart. Thanks, B.A. Don't thank me. Just keep it out of the trees. Get this bird off the ground. That guy's sweatin' bullets. I will find civilization, muchacho! I will bring back reinforcements! What on earth will you be doing while I'm gone? Just guess, Murdock. Just guess. Oops! Beautiful! That man is crazy. Yeah, but it's a good kind of crazy. Whoo-hoo! We are flying! ♪ Someday the birds will come to me ♪ ♪ Someday the birds will say I'm free ♪ ♪ Someday the birds will sing my song ♪ ♪ Someday the birds will come along ♪♪ You're gonna be okay, Pop. We're gonna get you there in no time. Uh, hang on, Lucy. I'm comin' around. I know you're only pretending to have your eyes shut! But it doesn't matter anyway 'cause it's gonna be a rough landing. Keep your arms in and don't put your feet over the side. I think I see the landing strip. There it is! I think we're gonna come in safely. Just hold your breath, Pop. We're on our way down. And with a... we are gonna manipulate this son of a gun into the correct position. Tighten your seat belts! Secure your trays! Blah, blah, blah! I am coming down! Oops! Pay no attention to that rip! Air goes through that like water through my nose! We are just 20 feet, Pop! Twenty feet! And we have... landed! Whoo! Phew. Help me! Help me! I got a sick man here! I gotta get him to the hospital! There's a hospital about a mile and a half down the road in Fulton. Best way is to put him in my four-wheel drive and take him on down. What the heck happened to him anyway? You've got some guys with white eyeballs living on the other side of that ridge! I've seen some crazy guys in my time. I've been in a whole ward full of them, but I've never seen anybody like those. - They did that to him? - Well, it wasn't a grey, furry squirrel with a shotgun! Now get! Get! Before he croaks! I'm on my way. By the way... would you mind awfully if I borrowed your shiny little chopper? Absolutely not! No problem, pal. Well, that's very kind of you. I'll certainly take good care of it. You Americans certainly know how to take care of your friends from across the sea. Have you had dinner yet, by the way, pal? Maybe we could get together... All right. Now we know where they is. There's that plane crashed up yonder in the holler... the one Zeb saw from the hills. We're gonna spread out and come in on 'em from all sides. There he is! Let's get him! Get him! Kill him! Get to the cars. Now, Face! Now, B.A.! I've had enough of this. Let's get out of here. Ain't nobody around here. We'll just close off this valley. We'll find them sooner or later. Whaa! Drop 'em! Do it now! Or the next one won't be over your heads! Everybody in the aeroplane! Now, close that door! Anybody sticks their head out... loses everything! - How come you put 'em in there? - Because I'm out of ammunition. The guy they tried to kill is with the road department. We'll hold these fellas down till you can come out and arrest them. Don't you love it? They're in there worried we're gonna kill 'em. And we're out here with no ammo. Hannibal, sometimes I think you're crazier than Murdock. Sometimes I am. All right, that must be it. Come on. Let's go. Inside. Come on! Will Colonel Lynch please check at the reservation desk, please? - Colonel Lynch, please check at the reservation desk. - M.P.s. Hey, man. In or out. I gotta take this bus in to be cleaned. Amy must have paged Lynch to warn us. Good girl. I wonder how long they been following her. Well, if it was since this morning and if we'd been on schedule... we'd have landed right in Lynch's military lap. - That means we're pretty lucky we crashed! - Ohh! I love it when a plan comes together.
