 The A-Team (1983–1987): Season 1, Episode 7 - The Out-of-Towners - full transcript 
 The A-Team travels to New York City to help out a group of beleaguered shopkeepers who are being extorted by a band of local thugs. Hannibal opens up a small TV repair shop and it isn't long before he gets a visit from the "insurance salesmen". B.A. follows them back to their lair, a trendy uptown bistro with a swanky owner. The team proceeds to put the pinch on them as they attempt to recover the extorted money for their clients.

 That was like running an ad, with 100 G's reward out there. How are we gonna get out of here? Freeze! Ten years ago, a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court... for a crime they didn't commit. These men promptly escaped from a maximum-security stockade to the Los Angeles underground. Today, still wanted by the government, they survive as soldiers of fortune. If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them... maybe you can hire... the A-Team. I don't understand why we gotta come all the way down here. This whole thing scares me. That Chinese man at the laundry said we were supposed to stand here until the bus comes. That's what he said. I don't know. Maybe this wasn't such a hot idea after all. I don't like carrying all this money around.

 I guess that's it. - Um... - Somethin' wrong? Uh, no, no. We were just supposed to be meeting somebody on this bus, and it's empty. On or off, honey. Don't matter to me. Follow me. I don't like this. You wanna hire the A-Team? Uh... Uh, yeah. We heard about you from some friends in Arizona who were in Vietnam. And, uh, they said, well... We came to Los Angeles, and we've been trying to locate you. We found somebody who said to go to this laundry, and we met a man there. A Chinese man, Mr.Lee. And he said to get on the bus. Yes, I talked to Mr.Lee. He told me you want us to rescue your friend, Bruce Warfel? Professor Warfel spent nearly two years feeding mathematical probability theories... into the ASU computer. He thinks that he might have found a system that'd beat roulette... chemin de fer and blackjack, even with a three-deck shoe. It's a mathematical theory based on the infinity concept of declining numbers. Don't look at me. I always hit at 15, stand on 17. Okay, what else? - Sue Beth. - Oh, yeah. Uh... He, uh, sent us this letter from Vegas saying that the system worked. And with the letter he sent this photograph. And then he just disappeared. The Xanadu Hotel doesn't even have a record of him ever staying there. We took the case to a detective agency when the police couldn't turn up anything... and, well, the detective we hired stayed on the case about two days, and then he quit. - Why'd he quit? - He quit because of that girl in the picture. - Who's she? - Gianni Christian's girlfriend. That's what the detective said, anyway. And, well, Gianni Christian is... We know who he is. Biggest hood in Vegas. A real killer. Yeah. Well, anyway, the detective was warned to drop the case. You see, we just have to save the professor. His mind's a national resource. That's lucky. His body's a national disaster. - Just a joke. - I'm sure you're all very macho and everything... but we happen to appreciate other qualities. I'm sorry about all you had to go through to get to us. But if you still wanna hire us, we'll do our best to find your friend. That's great. Uh... Oh. This is the money that he sent us... out of his first winnings in Vegas. Oh, yeah. Let's call Murdock and, uh, give it a shot. Pleasure meeting you, ladies. Do either of you girls know how to drive a bus? Well, I was raised on a farm. I can drive anything... a truck, combine. Well, if you wouldn't mind, there's a rental invoice on the visor. Take the bus to the address on it. We'll be in touch. That's the damnedest ten minutes I've ever had. A seven. Pay the man. I got two... two hot dice... two hot rocks. Oooh, and a winner! Another winner. Pay the shooter. And these dice are hot! Seven again! Let her ride. Daddy's gonna buy a new Cadillac. That's right. Xanadu Hotel. Mm-hmm. A $200 floral display. It's gotta be there in an hour. Okay, here's the message. Tony, you gave me the last 20 years of life. I owe you everything I am. Anything goes wrong... you tell me and a head rolls. Sign that... Your pal, Gianni Christian. Oh, uh, G-I-A... Double N... Thanks. N-N-I. Uh, Christian, yeah, like in the Bible. Right. Send that to the main desk, Xanadu Hotel for Mr. Tony Vincent. Have you got my charge number? Wonderful. Bye. Oh, I'm hot. I'm hot. Them bones... Them bones... Them shiny bones. Murdock, you better change into your wardrobe. We're gonna be there in an hour. What I roll, Face? - A couple of fours. - Oh, another winner. Hard eight. Pay the shooter. It was an eight. Look. Hood's from Atlantic City... he just made the big time. I'm gonna play this guy like the world has passed him by... until they licensed those casinos on the boardwalk. Mr. Tony Vincent... is nouveau big time, and he loves it. It's really too bad you're being chased by the military. You're a terrific actor. I'm also very macho. You know, I've been looking through these clippings on Gianni Christian... trying to find a chink in his armour, but I gotta tell you. I don't think we" re gonna find it. This guy is a security nut. He's going to and from his hotels either in a helicopter or an armoured limo. - Yeah, but it could work for us. - See, people who are paranoid are easily manipulated... if you play on their very fears. Gianni Christian practically runs Las Vegas. - That's absolutely terrifying. - Yeah, I'm shaking all over. - Face? - Huh? Oh, yeah. Terrifying. Christian is not a man to be crossed. I'm sure he puts his pants on one leg at a time just like the rest of us. Besides, we're getting paid for this one. Tony? Tony, all I said was Giorgio's has a store here. That's all I said, Tony. All you broads wanna do is burn money. You spend it quicker than the Pentagon. All I said was, Tony, that Giorgio's has a salon here. - Mr. Vincent's here to be checked in. - I'm sorry. What? Mr. Tony Vincent and party from Atlantic City. Uh, take a couple hundred. - Throw it on a number or somethin'. - I only said Giorgio's has a store here. - I didn't say I wanted to buy nothin'. - Get lost. Hey, sonny, you gonna check us in this joint... or we just gonna stand around and decorate the lobby? - Mr. Vincent? - Yeah. - He with you? - He's my protection. We're supposed to be in here. We don't... We don't have a reservation, sir. Nobody knew you were coming. This is for, uh, Mr. Tony Vincent. That's me. Here. Thanks, kid. Obviously, somebody knew I was comin'. I can't read nothin' no more. Read that for me. Ah, let me see. "Tony, you gave me the last 20 years of life. "I owe everything I am. Anything goes wrong... you tell me and a head rolls." Signed... "Gianni Christian." Hey, Gianni sent me a pot of flowers. Ain't that nice? What a guy. Mr. Vincent, we do have the Elvis Presley Suite, top floor. You're a good scout, kiddo. We'll take it. Hey, you got that picture Gianni gave me. Remember? Gianni says he's got a special chickola he wants me to try. Not bad, huh? Gianni can pick a pony, can't he? Yes, this is Elly Payne. Yeah, Elly something. That's what he said. Now... I want you to send Elly up to the Presley place... the suite. - Tell her Tony Vincent wants to have a good time. - Front desk. Here. Take the broad to Giorgio's. - Keep her away from me this afternoon, okay? - Yes, sir, Mr. Vincent. Send Elly Payne to me right away. And have somebody try and find Mr. Martell. We'll get the luggage. You just close the door. Better sweep the place for bugs. That's right, Mr. Martell. He just checked in. - Tony Vincent, from the boardwalk? - That's what he said. Mr. Christian sent him a big flower arrangement, some wine. And telegrams arrived just after he checked in. Well, I've never heard of him, but it could be legit. You know Mr. Christian. Have someone from the switchboard put a tap on that phone just to play it safe. - I'll check it out with Gianni. - Yes, sir. Tony Vincent from the boardwalk? - Xanadu Hotel. - Tony Vincent's room, please. I'm connecting you with Mr. Vincent's room. Yeah? It's Langley, 1650 code lock. Four score and seven years ago our forefathers brought forth... on this continent a new nation. That's enough. Stand by for, uh, computer voice check. Identity confirmed. Switch to verbal code six for transmit reevaluation. Surveillance and set-up complete. No recall. - Fail-safe full on. - A-1. Drop the pill. There goes Elly. Well, they should take about an hour to run this game on her. You, uh, wanna shot some craps? I really got the jazz. Boy, that was great running the con on that hotel clerk. - I thought I was pretty good. - You were fine. - Fine? - Yeah. Fine. - Clean, B.A.? - It's clean. - Better put the scrambler on the phone. - It's just a toaster, man. She won't know that. Murdock, give me a hand. We want her to think it's a command centre for a government hit team. Showtime. - B.A., get behind the door. - What about me? I may need a lunatic. Act normal. Hide behind the pillar. Put the lights down, B.A. Door's open. Mr. Vincent, you there? Yeah. Close the door and lock it... and turn on the lights, doll. Hi. I'm Elly. I was told you like to party. What kind of, uh, party do you like? I like a legal party. Special Agent Tony Vincent. Why, you creep. You got nothin' on me. Sit down and shut up, sister. This isn't about hooking. You're damn right it isn't. Meet Special Agent Jones. Be cool, mama, you won't get hurt. - What the hell is going on here? - It's all over, Elly. You're one of Gianni Christian's old girlfriends. I got 50 computerized pages on him and you. Now, if you wanna cooperate with us... maybe I won't let Bongo here... do something really bad to you. Come on, man. Now you said I could take her. You promised. Come on, man. She's pretty, pretty... Look, I don't know what you guys want. I'm just a working girl. We're from Washington. We're a special hit squad. We're in Vegas to take out Gianni Christian. We've been on him for five years. And that jerk stepped over the line for the last time. You're gonna kill him? You're supposed to be the law. We are. We're the executioners. Well, you ought to know one when you see one, baby. How many bodies have you seen buried in Nevada sand? Our records show you're an accessory to the murder of Tommy G... and you were actually there when he was killed. What can I tell you? I wanna know how to get into Gianni's back door without becoming a media event. I wanna know his whole security system. I wanna know his daily routine, minute by minute. I figure a girl like you knows about that. If I tell you how to get to Gianni, he'll kill me. Let me take her. You said if she didn't help, I could. Please? So pretty. - All right, all right, all right! Just keep this thing away from me! - Thing? Get him back, you hear? I'll tell you what I know. Speak up. Verbal code lock 116, on and set. Alpha set lock 48-6. Transmit 1460. Am I supposed to know what I'm listening to? It's what we got, Gianni. Came right off the tap on their phone. These guys are calling Langley. You heard. Sounds like some sort of code. Maybe they're feds on some kind of operation. Whoever he is, he's making me look like a fruit sundae. Taken the Presley Suite, room service bills, credit at the tables. I'll tell Jilly to drop on 'em. Do it quietly, and you bring 'em here. I'm dying to see my old friend Mr. Vincent from Atlantic City. It should be a very interesting reunion. Done. Maid. Maid, señor. Sorry, mister. Towels. Hey, lady, there's a "Do Not Disturb" sign on that door for a reason. Why don't you put the towels in the bathroom. Freeze... or I'll put a hole in you I could drive through. - Who are you, her husband? - Swallow it, punk. You got no sense of humour, pal. Bring his clothes. We didn't bring any clothes. Just a couple of toothbrushes and my golf clubs. - Me and Peaches ain't gonna need much to wear. - Darling! Come on, jelly bug. It's our anniversary. Now, you look it here. It's the very same room with the view of the Starlight Chapel... and the Xanadu Hotel right across there. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Thanks, pal. Close the door on your way out and hold our calls. Yeah. - No wonder I never married. - Thanks. - What do you think? Look like a three wood to you? - Uh-huh. I'll get the lights. That's the place. Right on the top. I grabbed this thing out of the room, Mr Christian. It was attached to the phone. I think it's one of them scramblers. I seen one just like it once... on Mission: Impossible. And a couple of charts. Big shot, Mr. Tony Vincent from Atlantic City. You come in here. You make a mess in my own house. You trying to make me look like a jerk or what? You got a light? Your name swings open a lot of doors in this town, Gianni. It also swings closed a lot of caskets too. Now you're not gonna do that. You're not that dumb. I figured the minute I tipped you I was in town, you were all over my phones, right? Wondering who I am? You know I called Langley, and you know I made it too easy for your monkeys to pick me up. Hey, maybe we just oughta have Jilly dump this jamoke down a gopher hole. You're a fed, but not a regular one. Look at this, charts... showing my movements to and from the hotel... to my house, vantage points, lines of fire. Looks like somebody's being set up... for a hit. - But feds? - We always suspected. - No one ever knew who hit the Montana brothers. - And Crazy Tommy T. You think he drowned on a fishing trip? We sent him over Niagara Falls with a rubber duck. And I'm the next target? What's to keep me from blowing you away right here? Because right after that, you'll get into your... secret elevator over here, and the cable snaps. Or when your limo pulls out to take you home... it blows up. And for a backup, someone who knows that limo always goes home empty... puts something loud and noisy in that blue Chevy Nova... in slot number two with the fake employee's name on it. Or maybe, uh, you're just looking out the window. A hole in one. Get out of here! - But... - Go! Now, let's talk about why I'm really here... and why you're not breathing dirt, Gianni. - Bruce Warfel. - Warfel, the math guy? Yeah. When I came down here scoping you out for burial... I found out you got this slide-rule genius with the system. A good enough system... that maybe a retiring fed could use it... to cushion his twilight years. This kind of government work doesn't pay that much. It's just fun. And you want me to hand over a guy who could wipe me out in the casino? What kind of a choice is that? You don't understand, Gianni. You're dead. You're a wash if I leave town without Warfel. Besides, I'd be willing to leave your community. I'd take Warfel to Atlantic City. - You're out of your nut. - Shut up! You think these guys are fooling around. It's not you they're gunning for. I'll be at the blackjack table nearest the front door... tomorrow afternoon at 6:00. If I decide to make the exchange. If you don't... at 6:15 that's you. Think it over. Life is short. Hey, Frank. Cheap jerks. Anything to save themselves a lousy buck tip. Hey, man, what you doing banging on my ride? Huh? Oh. I... - I just was wondering if you wanted us to park it. - No! Oh. Thank you, sir. Thank you. - It's five after. They're not going for it. - I'm going in after Hannibal. Not yet, B.A. They'll go for it. They have to. He looks okay. Well, howdy, Professor. How they been treating you? - Um, fine. Fine. - Good. Come on. - Now who are you guys? What do you want now? - We came to take you home. Home? You really mean it? Save your questions until later. Hiya, Professor. Regards from Sue Beth and Darlene. Sue Beth and Darlene? They must be worried sick. - How are they? Are they okay? - Terrific. It's Gianni! Gianni Christian! So, uh, tell me, Professor. All the chicks at Arizona State look like Sue Beth and Darlene? Thinking about going back to college and getting that education you never had? Maybe for a week or two anyway. - Am I really going home? - You sure are. I told you everything would go down smoothly. B.A., can't you get anything with some funky kind of sound on this thing? Just moments ago, casino owner and reputed underworld crime czar, Gianni Christian... fell to his death from the penthouse suite of one of his luxury hotels here in Las Vegas. Police already have a lead to the suspected murderers. Four mystery men and a woman who arrived in town yesterday afternoon... reporting to be friends of Christian. The leader of the group called himself Tony Vincent... from Atlantic City, New Jersey. Police have already verified this is an alias... but they hope to know Vincent's true identity shortly... from a photo taken by one of the casino security cameras. I don't think we're getting out of this burg very easily. We have a smokey to the left, Hannibal. Hold it, B.A. If we run this light, he's gonna be on us. This is X-Ray 16. Have 187 on Xanadu Hotel suspect. Vehicle in sight on Desert Valley Drive. - We've been made. - Hang on, everybody. B.A., did you lose him? What? Are you kidding, sucker? Better slow down so we don't attract attention. We gotta find someplace to regroup. This isn't going down very smooth, is it? It's not enough having the mob and the cops looking for us. When Hannibal's photo gets run for I.D... the computer's gonna spit it out onto Colonel Lynch's desk, and he's gonna trail smoke getting here. Cheer up, Face. Remember, it's always darkest just before it goes totally black. Carmine and Mr. DeSapio are even coming out from New York. - Well, we'll try to have Vincent and his gang before they get out here. - You make sure you have them! I want those guys. You spread the word. Open season on the slimes that killed Gianni. One hundred grand to whoever nails 'em. They were real nice to me, everyone in the casino. The more I won, the more they would buy me drinks... and let me go to the shows on the house and bring a guest. - Elly. - Yeah, Elly. What a sweet girl. She reminded me a lot of Sue Beth. Took real good care of me. I remember one night, I was feeling a little giddy. And I hadn't had anything stronger to drink than orange juice. Anyway, I remember Elly told me to go upstairs and lie down. And I did. And the next thing I remember... I woke up in this house somewhere, and there were these two big guys, and they wouldn't let me leave. - And they tried to get your system out of you. - No, not them. But this guy they would bring around. They called him Mr. M. - Martell. - He would make me explain my system to him. It's not a complicated procedure. If you understand the coefficients of prime-based numbers in random patterns... But I... I guess math wasn't one of his interests. Did you try primary trigonometry or logarithms... founded in remedial calculus? Yes, I did, but he couldn't grasp it. Hmm. Oooh, watch out, Woody. They tried to do that to me. Sometimes he'd get really angry and start yelling and screaming. I'd think he was gonna hit me. But then he'd calm down, and I'd try to explain it to him further... but I don't think he understood what I was saying. Probably what kept you alive. They were trying to figure out if you were just a guy who thought he had a system... was running into a stroke of luck, or if it actually worked. Here is a special news item break. Just handed to me from the KJJV newsroom. Hey, Hannibal, don't we know this guy from someplace? - Oh, wonderful! - Police officials believe the suspects are still in this area. One interesting twist to this situation, although it is strictly rumour... is Christian's associates have offered a $100,000 bounty... to anyone who can produce the missing Tony Vincent or his accomplices. Local police advise all would-be bounty hunters... not to take the offer seriously. Great. That was like running an ad. With 100 G's reward out there, every cab driver, hit man... or half a wise guy looking for a quick score is gonna be gunning for us. That's... That's illegal! You can't place a bounty on a human being's head like... like this is the Wild West. - Sure you can. - Who did kill Christian? Somebody who wanted the opportunity. I'd snuff out his lights unless he snapped to. Somebody grabbed the chance and chucked him out the window. You're right, Hannibal. I hung by to keep an eye on the van. A couple pin-striped suits came along and spotted it. Started checking it out. They didn't seem like cops to me. Well, I'm not worried about the cops. We'll get by them. But with that reward out and the whole syndicate on the streets... this town is covered with a blanket. - How are we gonna get out of here? - We stack the deck in our favor. - I got a plan. - I hope this plan is better than your last one. The last one worked. We got Professor Warfel. But this one's gotta get us out of town. - That's what I do best. - Guess who. I couldn't believe it. When Gianni decided to hand Warfel over, I begged him... "Gianni, don't trust this bum." Gianni... What can I say? He was becoming a little infirm. He let this guy back him down, scare him. Scuzzball goes and kills him anyway. He was breaking. He punked out. Maybe this guy Vincent did us a good turn. Listen, Jackie, we all know how much you meant to Gianni... and what he meant to you. I'd like you to know how right we feel about it... is that you be considered to be in line for a place on the committee, and I speak for all of us. It's an honor. Of course, I'll continue to run things around here... until the committee can come to some sort of decision as to... how to cope with Mr. Christian's unexpected demise. Then naturally, if you want me to... I'll stay on in whatever capacity. You're pretty quick to step into Gianni's shoes, Jackie boy. I only do what's asked of me, Mr. DeSapio. - No, thank you. - Thank you. - Oh, Pop. Pops. - I'm terribly sorry, sir. I'll get a towel. And what about this Vincent? Now, we can't just let anybody smack us openly like this. I told Gianni let me take care of him in the first place. Now I put the word out. He knows he's got me to tango with now. I'll bet you if he's not already dead, he's all the way to Timbuktu. I missed the plane, Jackie boy. And the shooter said, "Let it ride." Don't reach for anything unless you wanna see... everybody's brains all over the rug. I admit there probably isn't enough of them to make a big mess... but please, don't move. It wouldn't look good on the annual stockholders' report... to have three of its board of directors die in one day. Give me those chopper keys. - Open it up. - What? You'll never make it out of the hotel. Mr. Christian set up a security system. Nobody can get into that elevator without the code. - We had an electronics expert work on the fuse panel in the basement. - Take him, Face. Now, anybody tries to stop us, and smiley here comes back with a couple ounces of lead in him. I'd spread that around town real fast... in case some amateur hungry for the reward tries something. We don't like to be followed. Show him. - Go get 'em! - There's a staircase that goes to the roof! I thought you were going up to the helicopter. I like helicopters. Do you like helicopters? I love helicopters. You're never gonna make it to the freeway. Come on, Jackie boy. They won't do anything to endanger the life of their new capo di tutti-frutti... unless they find out you chucked your buddy out of a 30-storey window... like yesterday's newspaper. They must be headed for the garage. Come on! You had that planned all along, didn't you? I was just a convenient excuse, right? You made it so easy for me. Just as easy as it's gonna be to take care of you when this is over. - So much for Amy's exclusive. - I'll deny that. That's no good. Not in a court of law, but with the boys upstairs... Come on, Jackie. You guys are dog meat. - Elevator's all set to go back up. - What do you think of Christian's limo? She's okay. She's got an inch of armour plating and the glass is bulletproof. Murdock, here are the keys to the chopper on the roof. - Take the professor on back to Arizona. - I really haven't had a chance to thank you. Send us a postcard, Professor. Or better yet, send Darlene instead. - Okay, B.A., hit it. - Go for the tires! It's an armour-plated car! Better put some English on it, B.A. We got some party crashers. Give me a break. With all this armour, this thing corners like a semi. Well, take it easy. Remember, black is beautiful. Not on you, it ain't. That sounds like a chopper. - Looks like the cavalry is here. - Do it to 'em. Look out! - Now where'd he get this? - I don't know. Maybe they got some more. Well, well, well. - An Ingram with an extra clip. - Do you believe these guys? Open the roof, Face. Now, if that guy comes to, give him a concussion, huh? Right. Give me another clip. - Man! Hey, Cliff, you okay? - Yeah, I'm okay. Oh, thanks. Boy. Hannibal loves the jazz. Hey, guys. Notice who got the banner? - Come on, kid. We'll buy you lunch. - Oh. Four of Martell's buddies helped break him loose when they were transporting him back to Nevada. I don't think they broke him loose because they're his buddies. You don't? They helped him escape to kill him? Well, if they read the note I left, which they would have by now... Mr.Jack Martell is probably part of the foundation... of one of the new high-rises on the strip. The cops will find out he killed Gianni, which means that nobody's chasing us... except Lynch. Okay, why are you guys really here? - I got worried when you called and said you were coming by. - Have you seen Murdock? - Isn't he at the hospital? - Nope. We haven't heard from him since Vegas. - You're kidding? I hope he's okay. - Mama, he ain't been okay his whole life. Well, I did talk to Sue Beth and Darlene, and they said Professor Warfel got home safely. So that means Murdock made it as far as Arizona. I'm gonna quit worrying about Murdock. He's probably just trying to thumb a ride. Jerk! Tucson Tower, this is Trans Global 39. We've got a civilian down on runway 21. Looks like he's hitchhiking.
