 When a friend of B.A.'s ends up in a prison in Strykersville, FL, the team goes in with an elaborate plan to rescue him.

 Because I am God and I will slay them. Martin James... he's a madman. Have you heard this poem? "The time of right is the goal of the fight." Have you heard this poem? "Hickory dickory dock. The mouse ran up the clock." We're being chased by that maniac Reverend James. He's trying to kill us. We need your help. He's injured. Look, there's nothing we can do to help you. We don't even have a phone. - If we-- - Shut up! Shut up! We comin' in, Jack! Now get the first aid kit before you have to use it on yourself!

 Help! Throw out your weapons! I love it when a plan comes together. I will fear no evil. Thy rod and thy AR-15 shall comfort me, right, guys? What should I do with them? Of course, they'll be made to pay. Are we really going to die? We all got to accept death. It gives us the edge. Would you at least sign this thing? Paper works on the way, Jack. I'm taking off. Give me a sign. Give me a sign. Ten years ago, a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court... for a crime they didn't commit. These men promptly escaped from a maximum-security stockade to the Los Angeles underground.

 Today, still wanted by the government, they survive as soldiers of fortune. If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them... maybe you can hire... the A-Team. In the hills near the town of Redwood, California... five miles from the Oregon border, a maniacal religious cult leader named Martin James... has been keeping his youthful followers isolated from the outside world... controlling their minds by terror and intimidation. The A-Team has been hired to rescue one of them... a girl named Sheila Rodgers. Brother John, I'm going back up the street and keep a lookout. Ma'am, allow me. Thank you for your kindness, but they're sworn to vows of silence. Well, silence is golden, right? Boy, you know, you really fill out that tunic. You used to be a linebacker for the Rams? We do the Lord's work. If you're here to taunt us, please don't. Nah, nah. I'm just here to do a little fishin'. Well, uh, take care. Trouble? Let's pick up the supplies and, uh, move along. - She's there. - They got a lookout parked up the street. Better check on Murdock. This thing's gotta go smooth. I only got him out of the V.A. Hospital on a two-day pass. Whiskey Lead, this is Whiskey Deuce. We got a bogey at 5.00. He's all mine, Kemosabe. Murdock, you there? Oh. Yeah. Yeah, I be here, Hannibal. How we doin', muchacho? We're gonna make a try for her. Better warm up your birdie. - We could be coming in hot. - Roger. Is she there, Mr. Smith? Is my daughter with them? Clear this transmission. She's there. It's gonna be okay. Now, those guys are muscle-bound, and they got a backup. We're gonna have to do this fast. Let's go. Here's your blood. Try not to swallow it when you put it in your mouth. I want it to pop when I hit ya. Oh. Nice. - Ready, darling? - Yep. - But I'm really nervous. - You should"ve stayed back at the paper. You're the one who wanted to come along. - Now don't bust my chops, huh? - Shh! - For heaven's sakes, Dwayne! - I should've left you in Stockton. You know campin' in the wilderness ain't like life at Club Med. I told you that before we left, but, no! - You gotta complain and complain and... - Hush, Dwayne! People are lookin' at us! What, them? Don't worry about them. They ain't gonna say nothin'. They took a vow of silence. Right, kids? - Shh! - I think you are crude and disgusting! - Really? Really? - All you do is shout at me! "The pancakes are lumpy!" - The pancakes are lumpy. - "The orange juice is too pulpy!" Oh, shut up, Sue Ellen! Just shut your damn yap! You've been braying about coffee all morning, so why don't we get the coffee, hon? - Get the coffee and we'll get out of here, okay? - Okay! Allow me to assist you, my dear. Thank God there's one nice man in town. Hey, Wyatt, drift, okay? When we need the dumb waiter, we'll ring the bell. Hey, friend, you got a big mouth. Why don't you shut it... before I take a real dislike to you? Well, well, well. You know, you showed up at just the right time, Wyatt. I've been wantin' to hit somebody all mornin'. We're leaving now. Get the girl! Hey! They've got Sister Sheila! Go! Your father hired us to rescue you. Thank God. I thought I'd never get out of there. You just broke your vow of silence. And it feels wonderful! You don't know... I've been trying to get in touch with my father for 18 months. But they read our mail, and they censored it. It's like a nightmare out there. It's like a... like a prison camp. And Martin James... he's a madman. You're safe now... I think. You know, those blood capsules are really realistic. You think so? I swallowed it when I threw the first punch. - Hannibal split the inside of my lip. - I'm sorry, kid. - You walked into it. - Oh, no. There goes another cap. Why'd you gotta go bust Faceman in the lip for? You know if you make him ugly, that"ll mess up our meal ticket. Won't be able to get no more good hotel rooms. They're gonna be on us, man. Hey, Face, those blood capsules work great! - Keep your head down! - Hannibal knocked out his cap! - Hannibal, without the Faceman's smile, we get lousy hotels! - Get that bird off the ground! Hurry up! Hurry up! Go! Go! Hit the floor! She got away clean. I love it when a plan comes together. Get out of that van with your hands up. We need a new plan, right now! I believe it was General Grant that said... "When you're surrounded and outnumbered... - "there's only one way out." - Yeah? So what is it? - Surrender. - Throw out your weapons! Now come out of there one at a time... with your hands on your heads, or we will blow you sinners away! Say your prayers. Get us some help, Murdock. - Golly, they got guns! - What are you doin'? That's my unit down there, man. You gotta go with your unit, you know? We can't take a chance on getting shot. We can't, but as soon as I get you guys home, I can. Thank you, Daddy. Thank you so much. Martin James, he's... I- I know, baby. I know. It's gonna be all right. I will fear no evil. Thy rod and thy AR-15 shall comfort me, right, guys? - Hey, Face. - Yes? What do you suppose these guys wear under their skirts? Gee, I-I don't know. Half slips? Ooh! Garter belts? Ooh! I think you wear panty hose. The devil is a she-wolf who attacks the lamb in darkness. These sinners keep comin'. How long... How long can I... I've stopped dreaming. I used to dream, and now I've stopped. Welcome to Camp Awongo. Who is that? He doesn't look like the swimming instructor. What should I do with them? Of course, they'll be made to pay. I mean, somebody has to pay. Somebody has to. Take the transgressors to "C" building. Pray for your souls... that they should be received. Sweep the place. I thought these guys were supposed to be religious. This has nothing to do with Christianity. This has to do with power. He's a crazy cultist terrorizing kids. It's a sin to eavesdrop, guys. So what do we do now? How do we get out of here? Well, first off, we may not. We could die right here. Accept that. Anything else is just very good luck. - Figure you're dead. Can you do that? - Are you kidding? Look, Amy, we all gotta accept death. That way, we don't have no fear. It gives us the edge. - Well, I don't think I can. - Try. You gotta try. Okay, let's put it together. B.A. Okay, the motor pool is on the south side of the building. Looks like they make their own electricity. Their generator's on the east wall. No phones. One radio antenna... next to that building with the crazy-looking temple. One TV antenna next to the building in the middle, and that's probably Martin James's house. - You saw all that? - Face. They got a barbed wire bunker to the south and a guard tower beside it. Mess hall's next to the fence. Barracks are about 10-man deals. Sixteen on the left, 10 on the right. The guys in the brown robes are the soldiers. Mostly AR-15s, sidearms, hunting knives. It's a perimeter structure. One way in, one way out. Your basic Fort Apache layout. Add to that an armory right inside the gate. Not the greatest place in the world, but nobody said they were perfect. - So what do we do? - We wait. We try to stay loose. The next move's up to them. I'm scared. I'm really scared. We've been through some tough ones before, kid. North of Da Nang, 50 clicks from the D.M.Z., we all got taken by Charlie. But we made our opportunities. We got loose. That's why you gotta, right now, accept death. It, uh, calms you. Don't be afraid. I won't let nothin' hurt you. She ain't gonna be able to do it, Hannibal. We gotta help her through it. Okay, you're right. Amy. Now, do as we say. - Listen to us. - I don't wanna die. Neither does Martin James. - You can get back from here. - I think we should call the authorities. - No! No, no, no, no. - No, I mean police or National Guard. No, you can't do that. Remember what Hannibal told you. We're wanted. You send in the military or the cops, and the A-Team winds up in jail. Yeah, but they could die. If what Sheila says is true... they are madmen with machine guns. We'd rather die than wind up in jail. Leave it be. - I'll find a way to help them. - You're really going back up there? It's my unit, man. You gotta stay with your unit. Right now, I'm gonna see if I can pick me up some firepower. Just had a mountain cave in on the main shaft. I need some help. - Help! I need some help! - Help. All right. Have you heard this poem? "The time of right is the goal of the fight. "The Lord will prevail... where evil shall wail." Have you heard this poem? "Hickory dickory dock. The mouse ran up the clock. "The clock struck one. Down he run. You smell worse than my socks." Go on. Go on. Have all the fun you want, my friend... "cause my plans for you will not change." I mean, there's no appeal from my justice. There's no justice. One way or another, we all hoe weeds for the county. You keep comin'. It happens once, maybe twice, I say, "Okay." People that got money, they like to finance things. You come, you take the children of Jamestown. You take the novitiates from the altar. You try your sorcerer's song. You sing it loudly. You take not from me, from yourselves... in light... in life, in darkness. It's good. Tighten it up. Cut the stuff about the song... and it could play on public television. I find you guilty of crimes against the word... and I sentence you to a trial of worthiness. The Lord shall test them. They shall walk through the valley of his wrath. Now you're beginning to walk through the valley of my wrath, Preacher. Take them. Take them and test them in my name... for I am the god of this age. I rest not until my work is done. Seven days and seven nights. The new world will be built by the chosen! This man's a pothead, Hannibal. He's high on smack or speedballin' or somethin'. He wear them glasses so can't nobody see his eyes. Now you have all spoken and defied him. More to the point, the chopper got away. You're gonna be up to your shades in National Guard in an hour or two. You better cool it, Preacher. I will have my vengeance! I will seek payment, for you are mine... and I am his! - Take them. - Nuttier than an almond bar. And they were sent out into the fields... to be tested. The evil will be cast out... and given 500 paces... before the forces of good will pursue them. The devil was their choice! Take off your shoes. You will wear the shoes of a sinner. Hey, these are $600 ostrich skin boots, Jack. Tell you what. Let me hang onto 'em... and if the Maker wants 'em, I'll see to it he gets 'em. - Put them on. - Damn, these boots are hard to get. - Let the trial begin. - Face. I'm not through with you, tinsel-head. I'll be back. In the name of our Lord... and on my word... commit the souls of those sinners to your keeping! - Now! - Go into their world... armed with the sword of our saviour... for he who hath cut out the sickness of the beast... will be rewarded... in a world without end! Amen! Let's go! Come on, Amy! Come on! Run! - I can't! - Run or die, girl! B.A., hide in that ditch. Come on! Stay low. Go around and pick 'em up on the low road. They've gotta come out of here someplace. We'll go east. Reverend, we lost 'em. God's work has no room for failure. His will be done. It will be done! Hold it. - Okay, Face, take the point. - Got ya. Follow this streambed. Get up over that ridge. I'll keep my eye on ya. If you see anything, give me a signal. - Right. - Now, stay low. We keep separated. Count three before you follow me. B.A., you got the rear. I went as far as the trees. The preacher's got one lookout at the farm. But that's all they need. Can't get anywhere near him without being spotted. We gotta bring him to us. One of us can make it to that giant oak tree over there... and move from treetop to treetop until we get to the one by the farmhouse. Those branches don't look that strong to me. It's gotta be the lightest one of us. - It pays to stay fit. - Well, I'm really the lightest. No, you gotta be the bait. We gotta do something to get that jerk within range. He'd be suspicious if it was a man. Let's hear it for women's rights. Hey! Face! Face, are you okay? How many fingers am I holding up? Blue. - Tree. - Give me a hand. - How bad is he? - I think he's okay. - Oh, no. Not again. - Huh? What? - Oh. - Don't worry, kid. - I'll put it in with the other. - Oh, good. Please. Now, please. We've done nothing to you. Why don't you just leave us alone? - We need help. - What's going on? Who are you people? We're being chased by that maniac Reverend James. He's trying to kill us. We need your help. He's injured. Look, there's nothing we can do to help you. We don't even have a phone. My daughter and I have lived here for the past five years alone. We comin' in, Jack! Now get the first aid kit before you have to use it on yourself! I'm sorry. I'm just worried about my daughter. Reverend James would kill us for sure if he knew we were helping one of his unchosen. What do you have to do with Reverend James? Well, his men come and collect part of my crops. They don't like to go into Redwood and mingle with the town folk, so he does most of his food buying right here. - If I didn't help him, he said he'd kill us. - We understand. Believe me, we know how crazy he is. But we need your help. He's out there trying to murder us. We'd like to avoid that if we could. Well, like I said, I've got no phone. - You got any weapons? - Nothing. B.A., we"ll have to start scrounging. I'm sorry, but we'll have to go through some of your things. It won't take those rogues long to figure out where we are. Amy, how's Face? Oh, I think he's much better. Hey, Jack, I thought you was a farmer. This place looks like a junkyard. Well, I've turned a lot of junk into art. It's what I do. - What's in the barn? - My studio. Studio? You make movies too? What you call them, those art movies? - It's where I sculpt. - Mind if we take a look? No, not at all. - What are in these tanks? - Acetylene and oxygen. There's a year's supply. Just had 'em shipped in. - Got any steel pipe? - Yeah. Have you got a hot-water heater? There's one in the basement, but it doesn't work. Great. B.A. I want you to get that Jeep. Make sure it's full of gas. We're gonna wire a couple of these in the back of it, put the steel pipe on top of that. I think you can use it as a swivel. - Right. Beautiful. - I'm gonna take a look at your hot-water heater. No, I don't think you should be moving around much. Why don't you just stay on the couch? Nah, it's just a flesh wound. That's a fresh one. - Hey, he's really hurt, you know. - You're the doctor. Amy, grab a screwdriver and get that radio out of the Jeep. - And get some paint and get to work on the roof. - Got it. Uh, Face? If you feel well enough, I've got a hot-water heater I need to move out of the basement. Oh, I really don't think he should move around much. Aw. Move it, Lieutenant! No rest for the weary. I'll be back. Did you get it? Whoo! But... But I don't think I'd better let you take this... unless you have an order for it. - You know, the state boys, they count all this stuff. - I got 12 miners stuck in the main shaft! If we don't blow an airhole down to 'em, they eat it! - You tell that to the state! Open the door. - Every stick they count! And if we don't come up with all of it, we're gonna lose our permit. You understand what I'm sayin'? Would you at least sign this thing? Paperwork's on the way, Jack. I'm takin' off. Listen! That's not fair! You know where I had to go to get this? I'm doin' you a favour. You gotta at least sign this thing for me. I'll keep track of every stick I use, and I'll return the box. Open the door. - Thank you. - Return the box? - I don't know if that would do me any good. - Blades! Blades! Shoo, shoo, shoo! You, uh, thinking of taking a shower, Colonel? No, I'm thinking about giving one. Hey, Tim, bring that thing with wheels on it in for me, will ya? Yeah. I don't know who you guys are or what you're planning to do... but if I was you, I'd get in that Jeep... and head right out of here fast. That Reverend James does not play nice. It wouldn't be fun if he played nice. - Besides, I'm goin' back to his place. - What for? He's got over a hundred kids he's terrorizing up there that need help. Besides, he stole my boots. Nobody steals my boots. Take care, Face. - Is this gonna work? - I don't know. I've never done it before. But Hannibal says it will. Looks kind of quiet. Yeah. They're all out lookin' for us. - Is this thing gonna work? - Of course it's gonna work. You're gonna get 50 feet from that if that pressure gauge ain't lyin' to us. - You ready for the barbecue? - Works for me, man. Hey, Reverend, we got a little fire and brimstone for ya! Brothers, I'm in danger at the compound. I will lead the army! I will show the devil! Go! Come on, guys. Come on, guys. Give me a sign. Give me a sign. Oh, yeah. Murdock, do you read me? Over. Murdock, can you hear me? Over. Yeah, I hear you just fine, Face. Chopper's out back. - Murdock, you're a sweetheart. - I got us some aerial support too. - Are we intact down here? - Yeah. Hannibal and B.A. went to sting the monster. - What kind of ordnance you got? - Dynamite. Beautiful, pretty red ones. - Yeah? - You guys are incredible. You really came back. Of course he did. He wouldn't leave us in trouble. Okay, Murdock, hit the clouds. I'll call you when I need you. Channel one-niner. Roger wilco. That guy's as crazy as a Mexican rabbit, but I love him. - Are you sure you're all right? You really should be lying down, you know. - Mm-hmm. No, I can't lie down, not till we get Hannibal's boots back. And the wrath of my God... will befall the devils of this planet! Two feet to the left! And the Lord will deliver the evildoers into the fires of hell... to burn for eternity! So say I, god of this planet, created in my own image. Yeah! They will perish! Throw down your weapons and put your hands on your head... or I'll turn you all into burning bushes! Drop it, Reverend, or you'll be medium rare. Why'd you do it? I mean, I just can't figure it out. - Did it for the jazz. - The jazz? Yeah. The, uh, the jazz. It's-It's-It's like walking a tightrope... a thousand feet up without a net. The wind starts you swayin'. See, you know that at any second you could fall. You mean the thrill of danger? Yeah. Yeah. Only, you see, it's more than that. It's knowing... knowing that, uh... Well, feeling that you're quicker than... Well, I... I don't wanna sound corny, but, uh... it's knowing that you're risking everything... life, liberty, happiness... Knowing that at every second... you have to be quicker, stronger... faster and tough. Oh, yeah, tough as steel. - Tougher than steel. - Excuse me. I'm... Excuse me. Face, I looked and I looked... and I couldn't find Miss Trudy's Body Treatment for Bubble Bath anywhere. - What? - Bubble bath? Oh, yeah. Faceman loves bubble bath. He lives in it. - He says it makes your skin real... - All right, all right. Murdock? National Guard's just up the road. They'll be here any minute. Stand by to move out, B.A. Thank you. You know, you've rescued us from one year of terror. Well, no matter what they say, forget about our names and our descriptions, all right? If that's the way you want it, friend. I stopped dreaming. I don't dream any more. I... I knew then it was over. Hang on tight, Reverend. It's a bumpy road from here on. Okay, let's go. Coming, Lieutenant? Sir? Sir? Bless you. You saved us from a mad man. You're welcome.
