 I'm thinking  of "RuPaul's Drag Race." I'm sorry. But we are gonna have  a lot of fun tonight, and someone in the audience  is gonna have a chance to win $100,000. And, by the way, you don't have  to be here to win. You can play along  with us at home. And, while I  set up the first game, here's how you do that. Open your "Game of Games" app, and you'll see  a free scratcher ticket. During tonight's show, a lucky penny will appear  on the screen. Use your phone's camera  to capture the penny, then you can scratch away  and see what you've won. There are thousands of prizes,  so good luck. All right. You know, it's important to  live your life in the present. Never worry  about what's behind you unless you're playing  this game. It's time for Knockin' Boots. - All right, howdy, partners. Let's hear who--who are you  over there? - Hi, Ellen.  My name is Cyndi. I'm from Camp Pendleton. I'm a military spouse,  and I have three boys. Hi, boys. - Hi, boys.  And you are? - Hey, Ellen.  I am Dwight. I'm from  New Orleans, Louisiana, and I'm a minister. - Wow, fantastic.  It's my hometown. Yeah! - And you are? - I'm Elizabeth  from Madison, Indiana, and I just graduated  from college. - All right, wonderful.  - Whee! - All right,  before we get started, I want you to say "howdy"  to someone else. Give it up, everybody,  for Usher. - What?  Oh, my God! - Oh, my God! - How you guys doing up there?  - Just chillin'. - You nervous? No?  - A little bit. - A little bit.  - Yeah. - A little?  Okay. - Okay, and Usher is here to help me out. Here's how you play this game. - Saddle up for this one. Our contestants will stand  in front of a big, old boot. After three incorrect answers,  the boot will kick 'em in their keister,  and they're out. The last person standing  moves on to Know or Go. Yee-haw. - I like playin' games. - Uh-huh.  - Yeah. - Figured I'd help y'all out.  - All right, that's great. So we're all gonna  actually be the judge if this is a song or not. And I'll say a word,  and you're gonna have to name a popular song  with the word in it, and we'll go around  until someone repeats or can't think of one  in a timely manner. We're gonna start  over on Cyndi's side. - Whoo! - We need a song with either the word "rain"  in the title or the word "rain" in the song.  Go. - That's right. - All right, Dwight-- - Uh, you don't have to  do the whole song. Dwight. - That's right. - Um--my goodness. Uh, okay, hold on.  Give me a second. I know--um...  Uh. Ah...oh, no! - Yep. - Um--Oh, no.  - Uh-oh. - Oh, okay. What happens is, Elizabeth,  you get one notch up. Usher wants to--you wanna do it  at the end, right? That's your favorite.  - I'm gonna--yeah. - Okay, all right, so the boot  goes back a tiny bit. - Oh. - All right, just a little bit. - Oh.  - That's just the first one.

You're used to running around. - Oh, yeah.  - Yes. - Lot of energy,  both of those things. While you put on  your Aw Snap... Jackets, here's how you play  Aw Snap. - In this small  but crazy game, two contestants race  to put all five of their apples  into the basket. The first one to do it  moves on to Know or Go. - All righty, here we go. Megan, you will be going  for the Granny Smith. Taryn, you'll be going  for the Red Delicious. On your mark... get set...

Up next... - It is time to play Oh Ship! - And later,  it's Runaway Bride. - Welcome back  to my "Game of Games." This game will have contestants  rolling on the floor laughing mostly because  the floor is very slippery. That's right.  It's time to play Oh Ship! - Okay, tWitch, who are my yellow-bellied  landlubbers gonna be? - All right, here come Lisa Tate, Suzie Waldrom,  and Scott Copus. - Hello.  Who are you? Tell me about yourself. - I'm Dr. Lisa Tate. I'm a licensed  professional counselor in private practice,  and I also own two department of driving  services driving schools. - Wow.  - And I have two kids. - Two kids--that's four. - Whoo. - Fantastic.  Hi, kids. And you are? - I'm Susie Waldrom.  I'm from Phoenix, Arizona. I've been married 40 years,  and have 16 grandchildren, and Nonni's here! - Wow. Do you have children as well  or just the 16 grandchildren? - Yes, yes, five daughters.  - Wow. And they call you Nonni?  - Yes. - That's what I called  my grandmother. - Oh.  - Nonni, how about that? And you are? - Scott Copus.  I'm from Madison, Wisconsin. I'm semi-retired. Just wanna say a quick  shout-out to my daughters,  Sydney and Haley. Whoo! - Whoo!  - Whoo! All right, here's how we play. Ahoy, mates. In this game,  I'll ask contestants a multiple choice question,  then they must race to claim  the answer they want, but they gotta be fast,  because only one person can claim each answer. The first to get three correct  sails on to Know or Go. Let's play Oh Ship! Your answers are 3 trillion, 400 billion, or 6 million. Your question is,  "if there are approximately "400 billion stars  in our galaxy, approximately how many trees  are on Earth?" - Oh, man. - All right, Susie, you  ended up there by default-- 6 million trees. Scott,  you're at 400 billion trees. And then, Lisa,  you're at 3 trillion trees. How do you feel about that? - I don't feel good  at all about it. - No.  - It was the only thing I could get to,  but, you know, you never know what's gonna happen--I'm ready.  - You never know. So let's see who's right. You are correct! - All right. - All right.  Isn't that amazing? 3 trillion trees on--yeah.  - Amazing. - That's fantastic.  - That's good, yes. - Your answers are Bridgestone, Lego,  or Goodyear. Your question is, "This is  the biggest game show "on television, but who is the biggest tire manufacturer  in the world?" - I think this is--oh. - All right, well, yeah,  Goodyear and Bridgestone, we've all heard of those,  and Lego-- I did not know made tires. Every time that they would roll  the road would go, "ow, ow, ow, ow, ow," 'cause they're hard  when you step on 'em. Okay, let's see what happens. - What?  - Yes, Lego. - What?  - What? - I know! Here's a little fun fact. Lego--they make over 50%  of the world's tires for toys but still three times  as many as Goodyear. Isn't that amazing?  - Huh--it is. - This game is not just fun.  It's also educational. It's good for the whole family.  - Okay. - And by the way, it's--Scott,  you need to get on the board. They each have one.  - Trying. No, I know you're trying. I'm not saying  you're not trying... Just reminding you  that you're behind. It's my job. Your answers are yellow-ish, clear-ish, or pink-ish. Your question is, "what color is the sweat  of a hippopotamus?" - Go. - Oh. - Help her, Slippy and Trippy.  All right. - Whoo!  - All right. - Oh, my God. - All right, the good news is,  Lisa, that's where you wanted to go.  You were heading to pink-ish. And Scott, you were going  to clear-ish. Susie, yellow-ish. I don't know how  you would reason it out or get any of these right,  but let's see who's right. - Yeah!  - You are correct, Lisa! - Whoo-hoo!  - Ugh. - Ugh.  - Yes. - Okay, so, Lisa, you're one  away from playing Know or Go and one step closer  to winning $100,000. - Yeah! - Okay.  Your answers are debra, zonkey, or keybra. Your question is, "If you call  Kim and Kanye a Kimye, what do you call a cross  between a donkey and a zebra?" - You beat me!  - All right. Lisa went right for the zonkey.  - Yes. And a debra  is what Scott went for. Suzie went for a keybra. Let's see who is correct. - Whoo!  - Lisa! - Yeah! - You are going on  to play Know or Go, one step closer to $100,000. Yay--careful.  We'll be back! - I know destination weddings  are all the rage right now. Unfortunately  for these three brides, the destination  is gonna be the floor. It is time to play  the new Runaway Bride. - All right, tWitch,  who's gonna play? - All right, where are Kennedy Tate, Chandler Claire,  and Asia Walker? - I love you, Ellen.  - Hi. Hi.  - Hi! Hi!  Hi! Let's go, baby! - Let's go!  - Hi, you guys. Who are you?  - I'm Kennedy Tate. I'm from Houston, Texas,  and I'm a college student. - Yay!  - Yeah! - Yay. - All right, what are you studying? - English literature.  - Okay, wonderful. What are you gonna do?  - I'm gonna be an editor. - Oh, wonderful.  - Yeah. - Okay, and you are?  - My name's Chandler Claire. I'm from Redlands, California,  and I'm an avocado farmer. - An avocado farmer?  - Yes. - That's wonderful. How many trees do you have? - 250.  - 250? - Mm-hmm.  - And are you worried about, like, bears and stuff getting 'em 'cause they like the avocados?  - No. - No, you're not worried about it? - Not in Redlands, no.  - Okay, good. All right, and you are? - I'm Asia Walker,  and I'm from Dallas, Texas, and I'm a pre-med student. - All right, pre-med, wow. Okay. While we turn you  into blushing brides, here's how you play this game. Cold feet are gonna be the least  of these brides' worries. In this game,  three brides will sprint towards the altar  on a treadmill. I'll launch slices of cake  into the air, and then the brides will fight  to catch them. But beware--not everything  I launch will be cake, and that stuff  is worthless, huh? First bride to catch  three pieces of cake and place them  on their hope chest will win my heart, and they'll  move on to Know or Go. - All right,  you look beautiful. Ooh, whoo-hoo. - I got you something  for the wedding. One of them is this industrial  treadmill right in front. Let's start this treadmill up  for you. And the other gifts  will be launched from over here, so brides,  get ready to catch some cake. First one to get three slices  and bring 'em back there wins. Ready?  Go. - Ugh, ugh. - It's cheese! - It's mine. Whoa.  - You've got another one! - I don't want that. - One point--you can catch up. - Ow. All right. Chandler is the winner. - Congratulations.  - Thank you so much. - Oh, my God, that was tough. - I feel like  I'm on a treadmill. - That was really good. When's the last time you were on a treadmill like that? - Never.  - Never, okay. Well, you did very, very well, and it was hard to differentiate, but you were-- Kennedy was close behind you. All right, one step closer to $100,000. You're going to play Know or Go. We'll be back. - Congratulations.  - Thank you so much. - Winning was a piece of cake  for Chandler who is one step closer  to $100,000. Coming up--who will know... - Um...  - Come on. - Uh, uh.  - Oh, God. - And who will go? - I hate to see  my contestants go, but I love to watch 'em leave, especially  when we're playing Know or Go. - Can see someone's bald spot  from up here. That's wonderful. tWitch, I need you to bring  our players out, please. - Whoo! - Whoo!  - Whoo-hoo! - Whoo! - All right.  Oh, hi. How's it going up there?  - Hey, Ellen. - Hi. All right, Dwight,  you sang your heart out in front of Usher until you  got the boot on Knockin' Boots. Taryn, you snapped up  four apples before your opponent  even got one in Aw Snap. Lisa, you fell on your behind,  but you got back up on Oh Ship!  - Yes. - Finally, Chandler,  it was a cakewalk for you in Runaway Bride.  That was amazing. You got a piece of cake,  and you won. Okay, this is exciting 'cause  the person who's up there last is gonna go on to play  for $100,000. This game is very simple.  I'll ask you a question. If you know, you stay.  If you don't, you go. I'm gonna be forced  to push a button, and you drop,  and something's down there, and I'm not sure what it is. Let's play Know or Go. Dwight, New York City  is known as the city  that never sleeps. Las Vegas is known as Sin City. What city are we in now? - Los Angeles. - That is correct. Taryn--Taryn,  for this question, may the odds  be forever in your favor. What movie franchise  is famous for  "May the force be with you"? - "Star Wars." - That's correct. - Whoo! - Lisa,  we're just getting started, so I'll give you a break. What candy bar's slogan is "Break me off  a piece of that..." - Kit Kat Bar. - That's right. - I did not know that. - Chandler, you're standing  on your own two feet. How many legs do spiders have? - Um...I don't wanna get  a simple one wrong. Are they insects? Um...it's either eight or six. I'm gonna go with...six. - That's your answer?  - Yes. - It is not.  It is eight. Oh, Chandler, that's so sad,  but you look so pretty. - No, no, no, no, no, no.  - Oh, no. Look, I'll tell you what. I won't drop you if the  audience doesn't want me to. Do you want me to drop him? - Why are you saying yes? - I-I couldn't understand them. I think they said yes,  so I have to drop you. - Oho, oh, oh! - Whoo-hoo!  - Oh! - It wasn't clear.  I couldn't really tell. All right, Dwight. Whenever I hear  the sound "dum dum," I immediately think  of "Law & Order." What's the name  of the wooden mallet a judge bangs to call order? - Gavel! - That is right, a gavel. Taryn, Ryan Reynolds made me  swear not to tell anyone that he sleeps  in cheetah print underwear. Who sang the song,  "Our Lips Are Sealed"? - "Our Lips Are Sealed," okay.  Um... "Our Lips Are Sealed,"  uh...oh, God, uh... Um--  - How's it go? You know the song?  - No, I don't. - No, no. - Group, single--is it both?  Is it maybe one? Uh, let's... Britney Spears?  I don't know. - Oh, no.  - No. - Again, you know what? I won't do it if the audience  does not want me to drop you. - Don't! - Do you want me to drop her  or no? - No, no, no. - That's so rude.  - No, please don't. - Yes, they said  they wanted me to drop you. - No, no, they said no.  It was misinterpretation. - I didn't hear no.  I heard yes. - No, please.  - I did. I'll ask 'em again.  What do you think? - Oh! Oh-ho! Oh! - "Our Lips Are Sealed,"  The Go-Go's. How soon we forget the Go-go's.  That's the-- All right,  so now this is very exciting. We're now on Sudden Drop. This is what happens now.  I will ask you a question. If you don't know it,  your opponent gets a chance to answer. If they know it, you drop. If they don't know it, we  go right back and start again. This is really the most  exciting part of the-- especially  when my stage manager, Linda, gets so excited she--  she looks at me the same way when I tell her the wrap party  has an open bar when she knows  that this is happening. All right, let's do this. So since Taryn dropped,  I'll start with you, Lisa. Destiny's Child  sang "Survivor." Survivor sang  "Eye of the Tiger." What reality show is hosted  by Jeff Probst? - By whom?  - Jeff Probst. It's not a good sign.  - It's not. Jeff?  - Jeff Probst. - Probst. Oh, God, I'm sweating. Um, Jeff Probst.  Come on. Um, I'm just gonna have to  take a guess. Jeff Probst--what about...  - Mm-hmm? - "Survivor."  - How about that? That's the right answer. - Yeah! - Oh.  - What? - Oh!  - What? What? - Oh!  - Yeah. Oh.  - Wow. All right.  - Okay. - Sometimes the answer's  in the question. - Yeah.  - Yeah. - Yeah.  - All right, Dwight. Big & Rick sang  "Save a Horse" What kind of doctor typically  puts your feet in stirrups? - A pe-- A peda--  - Yep. - A ortho-- A orthopedic doctor. Um... a podiatrist. Uh... A podiatrist maybe? - Is that your answer? - Yes. - Do you know the answer, Lisa? - Gynecologist.  - That is right! - Yeah! - Ah, no! No!  - Oh, Dwight. - No, this just sucks!  - Oh, Dwight. I'm so sorry.  - I don't know what-- - I know. No, there's no reason  for your children to put their feet in stirrups  when they go see their doctor. - Oh, that--  - All right. - I don't--  - I know, but that's why  this is called Sudden Drop. - Oh! - Because it just  suddenly--you just drop. Oh, my-- - You win.  - Yes. - You're gonna go on  to play Hot Hands for a chance at $100,000. - Yeah! Wait!  - What? Don't drop me. - No, the one thing  we didn't put in is stairs, so the only way...  - No, no, no, no, nooooo!  - That's the only way you have to come down. We'll be back. - Whoo-hoo! - Whoo-hoo!  We are back with Lisa who is one step away  from $100,000. - Yeah! - Tell me what that money  would mean to you. - It would mean the world to  me--I would utilize that money to help young people  in my community through driver education  and through counseling, what I do for a living.  - That's wonderful. - Yeah.  - Well, then, I'm rootin' for ya.  Have you played the app before? - I love the app. I play it all the time. - Okay.  - And I'm pretty good at it. So we'll see.  - Pretty good is not enough, but that's good--I would keep  playing till I was excellent, but, look, I think  you're gonna do fine. We're rootin' for ya.  This is the moment we've been waiting for.  Let's play Hot Hands. Okay. Lisa, here's what's gonna  happen. We are gonna show you  a series of celebrities.
