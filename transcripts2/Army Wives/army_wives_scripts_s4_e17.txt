I can handle it, if you want to wait outside, Moran. This girl's been through a lot. Better she sees someone she knows. I brought her in. Yeah, slapping the cuffs on can be a real bonding moment. Gina! Oh, my God. You came. You got my message. I didn't do what they're saying. I swear I didn't. You believe me, don't you? I need some "yes" and "no" answers from you, And it better be the truth. Have you been using? No. I've been clean 19 months. This guy Travis Jenkins... he use, deal? He hit you? The neighbors said he hit you, Jas. Travis has a temper when he drinks. It's, uh... Your track record with boyfriends really sucks. Joan. Hi. Yeah. Claudia joy said you might call. Yeah. Uh, okay, sure. Your boyfriend... he work? I really appreciate this, Joan. No, uh, I waitress. Okay. Got it. Yep. Got it. Hi-def flat screens, fancy sound system, Expensive booze in the liquor cabinet. And when did this happen? Where'd he get his money from, Jas? He said he made good investments. Do you know why? Okay. That'll be great. Okay. Okay. Is there anything else I need to know about Travis Jenkins, Anything that you did not tell The Charleston police department? No, he's just a... he's a normal guy. I met him at a bar last year. Friends? Enemies? Anything? People liked him. Okay. Okay. I'm gonna take care of this. So you and Jasmine... What's the connection? Not important. But you think she's innocent? Hope so. You read the forensic report, right? Yes. She didn't have any gun residue on her arm... You know what? I don't mean to be... Or anything. If she did... I don't mean to be rude. Hmm? All I really need you to do Is drive me where I need to go, okay? So you know, I am not your chauffeur, And you can't be doing any of this without me. So what's the story with you and Jasmine? Okay, for the sake of time... Hey! Okay? Jasmine was my confidential informant On a big drug case. She got clean. She gave me evidence on the guy that ran the whole operation. And I thought Charleston was a good place For her to lay low until the trial. You know, I spent three years of my life Building this case, And now my key witness is accused of murder. So you need her to get off So your case doesn't fall apart. She stuck her neck out for me. I owe her. Was that so hard? I need to learn about the victim. If Jasmine didn't kill him, who did? Well, we might want to try Talking to army sergeant Joe Cory. He bunked with Jenkins in Iraq. Jenkins was army? That wasn't in any of the reports. Yeah, but the house was a dump, And the shoes in the closet were polished to such a high gloss... Definitely says "military." Plus, there was a Gerber knife on the end table, And lots of soldiers have them. And then he had the tattoo on his arm. He had lots of tattoos. Yeah, but this one said, "3-20-03." The day we invaded Iraq. So I talked to a friend of mine at fort Marshall, And she said, Travis Jenkins was dishonorably discharged From the army two years ago. Why? Don't know yet. Somebody who puts a half-pound of sugar in her coffee Keeps rushing me off the phone. Do we know where sergeant Cory lives? We don't, but I do. It's a rookie cop thing. We're really good at addresses. Murdered? Wow. When was the last time You saw Travis Jenkins? Oh, man. A long time. Uh, five, six years. Him and me had some pretty wild times Over in balad back in '04. Wild how? Oh, you know, crazy time, crazy place. Iraq, then... We never had the body armor we needed, Rules changing every day. When they put you on the edge like that, You get to like living on the edge. And that was Jenkins. So what got him his dishonorable discharge? Don't know. He got bounced stateside. Me and Jenkins, we shared quarters together, But we weren't that close. Hell, after Iraq, We never saw each other again. You ever hear of Travis crossing anybody back home, Somebody who'd want to kill him? I heard he got mixed up with some bad people, But I don't know that for a fact. But it wouldn't surprise you? No, ma'am. Not one tiny bit. The guy who got killed was former army? Stationed at fort Marshall. I didn't know Pamela did investigative work like this. She doesn't, But they paired her with a Detective from Atlanta. Well, you'll have to keep me posted. How long will you be out of range? Two, three days tops. Hopin' to make headway with some remote village elders Who are gettin' squeezed by the Taliban. Why are you going? Their elders prefer to negotiate With our elders, And... That would be me. I never knew elders could be so sexy. Eh, I still got a few good years left in me. Crap. It's been resealed. So much for full access. I shouldn't have messed with his bowling trophy. What about Jenkins' vehicle? Anybody find anything there? Not that's been logged into evidence. It's worth another look. Can't without probable cause. I smell probable cause all the way over here. I don't smell anything. Marijuana. It's the heat. It brings it out. Come on. Thanks. Okay. Okay. Gas... Gas... Groceries... What is it? It's a parking receipt from day before yesterday. The day Jenkins was killed? Say where? Exchange street. Wanna check it out? Yeah. Right after you change out of that uniform. Okay. Think I can do that. Ooh. Hey. What? What's this? Whoa. I'm not sure what, um, solid gold feels like, But I think it might feel like this. Wow. This is worth about $1,000. Really? Whoa. Hey. Jackpot. $2 an hour. Receipt was for $10. What's a guy like Travis Jenkins do In this part of town for five hours? Hello. Well, goodness gracious. Now we know what he was doing here. I got it. I got it. So we're just breaking in now? Well, I smell smoke. Don't you smell smoke? You ever smell anything that actually exists? Ladies. I'm sorry. This is a private club. Really? Because it looks like a casino, Which can't be right, Because gambling's illegal in this state. So is breaking into a building without a warrant. Look, we just need to know if you've seen this guy. We have a policy about protecting the privacy Of our guests. Well, this guy doesn't care about his privacy anymore. Bullet to the chest sorta took care of that. Look, as far as I'm concerned, all of this is a harmless vice. But this? This is a homicide investigation, And this is all I care about. He was in here day before yesterday, wasn't he? Yes, Mr. Jenkins was here. Okay. Did anything unusual happen? Like what? Why don't you tell us what happened, And we'll decide if it's unusual? Here it is. Oh, that's Jenkins in the middle. The other gentleman enters here. Wait, wait, wait. Freeze it. Can you zoom in? Well, you get around, Don't you, sergeant Cory? Hi. Sorry to bother you again, But we need to ask your husband a few more questions. Uh, Joe's not here. He got called on field exercises. Is everything okay? He got called today? Yeah, right after you left. Army calls, he goes. About 6 feet tall, red hair, buzz cut, Last seen wearing a red t-shirt And khaki shorts. Okay. Thanks, Boone. All right. Every law enforcement officer in the county Will be looking for him now. We're gonna look stupid If he really is off doing army business. He isn't. 23rd's deployed, And rear detachment isn't doing field exercises. Okay. So... What do we know? They probably took the fight home. Things got ugly. Cory shoots Jenkins. So we have a big problem with Cory. If he is looking for the money, He's coming after Jasmine. Yeah, which means jail is actually The safest place she could be right now. Okay. So all of this leaves us... Nowhere. Absolutely nowhere. Okay. I can't think. I gotta eat. Okay. So what's your deal? You always want to be a cop? Oh, God. We're not sharing now, are we? Come on. I don't know. I guess I always had a thing about right and wrong, You know? And the health insurance isn't bad, either. What about you? It runs in the family. Spent three years on the force in Boston. Boston? Really? How'd you end up down here? Ended up a lot of places. Married into the army. And now? Divorced... Out of the army. All right. Check this, Boston. Nothin' but net. Hey, Boone. What's up? Okay. Got it. On our way. You could take him off missing persons... Joe Cory. Here ya go. House special. Mmm. Thank you. Mm. I can't believe she can eat after today. It's not the same fish, Moran. Okay. Hey, did Chase pick up the kids on time? That was okay? Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah, and, uh, he dropped 'em off At Riley's slumber party. oh, thank God for Riley's birthday today. Mm. Yeah. Uh, Gina, do you have any kids? Oh, God. No. No. Oh. Okay. Okay, so, uh, what's first for tomorrow? Ballistics report. It's not much, but we have the two bullets now, So let's see if they're from the same gun. Well, same gun could be same killer. Probably. And that would prove Jasmine was innocent. All right. Can I get you guys anything else? No. Thank you so much, Rox. Sure. Well, thank y'all for coming in. Bye. I'll see ya later, sweetheart. Bye. Thanks. I can get this. No, no. My town, my treat. You can get the next one, okay? Hello. Who is that? Oh. Those are my kids. Um, Katie... No, not them. Him. Him? Mm-hmm. Um, well, that's their father Chase, my ex. Nice. He's hot. Yeah. You'd think he'd uh... Be, like, into brunettes? Down for the brown? I... um, no. I'm just kidding. What about you? You dating anyone? No. You know what? Let's get a couple more of these. Come on. Okay. So I just got this in from I.B.I.S. Up in Columbia. The striations match. The same .45 killed both Jenkins and Cory. Yeah. Any hits from bullets from other crimes? I don't know. I'm gonna check the database now. Oh. The Captain just got off the phone with Atlanta. They need you back home asap. But there's still a killer out there. They're dropping the charges against Jasmine Wilks, And that killer's our problem. She's being released? Yep. In about an hour. Now she'll need to stay in town to be available For questioning until we wrap things up, But your key witness is free and clear now. If you need her, call me. Moran, you're back on the beat tomorrow. We've gotta find out if this .45 has a history. Yeah, and who had a connection to both Cory and Jenkins. It could be a soldier. Because? Because the only thing those two had in common Was serving in balad in 2004. Just means we have to keep digging. What about your boss in Atlanta? What about him? He's expecting you back. And I'll be back... Eventually. You in? I was told to stay with you Every minute you're in Charleston. Boone. Hey, you're on speaker. Hey. I heard your pet project got released. Yeah, we're on our way to pick up Jasmine now. What's up? Search of Cory's house found 100 grand in gold coins... Krugerrands. Wife was clueless. Maybe he did find the rest of Jenkins' gold. Well, they don't think so. Why not? Apparently, they dug it out of an old, dusty crate That was in the attic. Nobody had touched that crate in a long, long time. Were there any weapons in the house? No .45, but ballistics matched your bullets To 3 robberies in '02. Okay. Thanks. Do I have to stay here alone? Just keep the door locked, and you'll be fine. You got something against maid service? I just don't like people in my room when I'm not here. Expecting company? Maybe. How long will you be gone? Just watch some TV. No pay-per-view. They don't reimburse me for that. And don't use the phone unless it's to call one of us. All right? Yeah. You'll be okay. All right. Just stay put, okay? Okay. Gun registered to a Dwayne Carson. Carson, Dwayne. Long rap sheet. Burglary... Auto theft. Please tell me we have a current address. Sure do. Maser state correctional facility. He's been in prison the last two years. So it was his gun that killed Jenkins and Cory... But it wasn't him who pulled the trigger. Okay. Okay. 8-year-old crime. This could take a while. Well, we need to find the evidence report And see what happened with that gun. Better not be anything funky in here. If there is, That nose of yours should be able to sniff it out. Okay. Okay. Evidence report. No. No gun. What? No. That's weird. All of the police reports mentioned a .45. Well, somewhere between the crime scene And the evidence room, that gun disappeared. Well, who was the arresting officer That filled out the evidence log? Oh, my God. We gotta get back to the hotel. I don't know anything. Please. I can't trust what you know or don't know. I don't know anything. Please. Please. I told her not to leave the hotel. Well, she'd go with a cop. She's not answering. N-no! This is a waste of time. Gibson is not gonna take her back to the scene of the crime. You got a better suggestion? Wait a minute. Cory's body was found way offshore, right? Yeah. How do you shoot a guy, dump his body in the ocean, Unless you've got your own boat? Hey. Your radar gun is wondering when you're coming back. She misses ya. Gibson's a fisherman, right? Yeah, yeah. Won some bass contest a couple years ago. We didn't hear the end of it for months. Do you know where he keeps his boat? Yes, he has a place way out at the end of Mansfield island. Why? Moran? Moran, are you there? That's his car. Yeah. All right. Let's go. Come on. Hold it right there! Gina! You move, she's dead. Half second after that, you'll be dead. Call me crazy... Doesn't sound like a win-win. Where's Moran? At the hotel, in case Jasmine showed. You just wanted to do this on your own. You've got three years of my life out there. I'm not letting you go. Back off, Maddox. Think about what you're doing. It's okay, Jasmine. You're gonna be fine. Use your head. All of us could be fine. What are you talking about? Drawin' a blank right now, I think you know Gibson. Then let me fill in the blanks. Half a million... All you have to do is walk away. That's tempting. But I think what I'd rather do Is shoot your corrupt ass off this dock. I'm gettin' in that boat. That's it. Jasmine, come on! Hurry! Get behind me! Stay there! UN-freaking-believable. Gibson killed Jenkins? Jenkins and Cory both. He just confessed. Yeah, they all met in balad. Jenkins and Cory were soldiers, And Gibson took a year off Metro police To go over there and do security. Hundreds of millions floatin' around in those days, And no accountability. So they just helped themselves? $2 million each. They had it laundered into the gold coins, And then they smuggled it back here. Yeah, they agreed to stash the gold And wait for ten years before they spent it, Except Jenkins decided to make an early withdrawal. And then when Cory tore up the crime scene, Gibson knew he had another problem on his hands. So he shot Cory, too. Took him out on his boat and dumped him. What means there's still a lot of gold out there somewhere. Hmm. Jas? You ready? You okay? Yeah. What? We almost had a first out here today. A first what? Officer-involved shooting... With a tree trunk. Bite me. So... All that gold out there... Wonder where it is. Maybe better it's a mystery. Buried treasure and all that. I'm gonna get a shovel and start digging. I could do that. I could help. Boston, you solved your first homicide. How do you feel? Good. Thanks. You know, considering where we started, I don't think we did too bad. No, we didn't. I know Boone's itching to get his partner back And everything, And you know, there's nothing wrong with being a beat cop. But? You ever think of taking the Detective's exam? You know, like, moving up? You should. Be a real waste if you didn't. So... All right. Well, if, uh, you're ever in Atlanta, Look me up. Careful what you say, 'cause I might just do that. Miss Daisy, do I look like Morgan Freeman to you? Get your butt in the front seat! Thank God she wasn't hurt. I know. To be in the middle of a shoot-out like that... Yeah. And Pamela was right about that girl all ong? Yeah. Big win for her. Yeah. Ohh. Well, my life isn't nearly as exciting as all that. Ohh. But I did pack my maternity bag this morning. H. I'm ready whenever she is. Oh. Great. Thank you so much for hosting today. Of course. Michael? What's happened to my husband? We have a situation.
