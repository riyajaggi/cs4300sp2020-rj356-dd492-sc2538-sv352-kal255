 Army Wives (2007–2013): Season 4, Episode 15 - Hearts & Minds - full transcript 
 Trevor's unit enjoys entering a friendly Afghan village, until a bomb car kills most civilians, including the young boy Jeremy just gave a football. Seeing tow of his mates being carried in badly wounded, nurse Tanya tells Jeremy she can't see him again on account of a fiancé back home. Zamboni operator Zach, an NCU student Emalin meets when she tries to re-enter competitive ice hockey, charms her, but Claudia Joy's excessive enthusiasm for the potential son in law at a home dinner scares her. General Holden resists radios contractor Anne Perkins' flirtation meant to become more. The Hump Bar needs a gig while the soldiers are all overseas, so the girls help Roxy set up speed-dating. Chase picks up Pamela there after losing a bet. Pregnant Denise panics and moves to Roxy's.

Okay. The first few steps, I was really nervous. Um, in fact, I almost fell. Zach had to catch me. But then it all came back, like that. I mean, I was... I was working every edge. I was doing pivots and c-cuts. I wasn't babying my knee at all. That is so great, em. I know! I'm gonna contact Woodsen first thing in the morning, See if they'll give me a tryout. Perfect. Wait. Um, one question. Who's Zach? So I've got a surprise. Yeah? Yeah. My p.E.T. Scan results today showed great improvement. Well, that's outstanding, Joan. Dr. Patterson says, if my tests check out this week, It's okay for me to start light exercise again. So since things are going so well, I was thinking I could take care of Sara Elizabeth myself tomorrow. I ran it by Dr. Patterson. She signed off on it. Okay.

Run away. R-run away! Aah! Told ya. Morning, Sherwood. Nice day, huh? Uh, yep. Um, not too hot yet. Ooh, I don't know about that.

When exactly did we lose contact? 0916. Team was 20 miles out, just like last time. Good morning, general. Mr. Keen, once again I have lost radio communication With my forward observers. As I explained, general, the microwave amplifiers... I don't want explanations, Mr. Keen. I want results. If you tell me we have over-the-horizon capabilities And yet we are effectively limited To line-of-sight contact, Then we have got a serious problem. Lives hang in the balance. Let me clear about this. If I am not equipped with a new supply Of working radios by the end of the day tomorrow, I will file a formal complaint with Washington, And we will be looking for a new contractor. General holden. Anne Perkins, sir. I oversee Mr. Keen's group from Washington. So it's you I should've been addressing right now. Exactly. The buck stops with me, general. We can do better. We have to. And as you say, lives depend on it. We've had trouble with this amp supplier before, And as far as I'm concerned, they're history. Just get me my radios. See to it. General holden, I'd love to pick your brain For other ways my company could better serve the army. I have a lot on my plate, Ms. Perkins. Maybe when I'm back stateside. I would like to find ways to help before that. I'm only here two days, and any ideas you have, I could work on from back home While you're still in theater. You have to eat, don't you? Lunch. 1200. My office. 30 minutes. Thank you, general. I've got an updated checklist right here. Um, Dr. Garland's office has moved, so the new number is... Roland, you are worse than I am. You're right. Don't worry about it, daddy. We got this. Right, baby girl? Okay. You two have fun. Mwah, bye. Mm. Mwah. You call me if you need me. Roland. I'm just saying... bye-bye. It smells so good. Yeah, I was just doing some baking. I know. I, uh, I couldn't sleep, So, uh, I decided to make some care packages For Frank and Jeremy. Oh, and the entire division, from the looks of it. Ohh. Oh, look, honestly, I-I just needed something, Anything to take my mind off the fact that my belly itches, And I have heartburn, And my boobs... I mean, look at 'em. They have their own zip code. May I? Yes. Mm. And I can't sleep, And I can't take anything for any of it, And on top of that, it's allergy season. You know what you get when you mix hay fever With a small human being pushing on your bladder? A lot of 20-yard dashes. Excuse me. Ohh. Oh. Whoo! Hey, Roxy. What's up? Sorry to bother you. It's cool. We're code 7. Oh, God. Code what? Sorry. Uh, food break. Boone's waitin' on a bag of boiled peanuts. You're coming tonight, right, to the speed dating? No. I wasn't planning on it. Why? Well, because I'm very nervous. What's wrong? You're not getting any interest? No, just the opposite. I'm getting a lot of male interest. I need more females... Like a certain single redhead that I know. Wait. You are not asking me to participate. Who knows? You could meet someone. Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no. Pamela. No, Roxy. My dating life is on hold... Forever. This whole thing was your idea. You have to help me out. You're seriously trying to guilt me into this? Maybe. Is it working? Not really. Margaritas. Uh, I've got a sitter. You could drop Katie and Lucas at my place. Free babysitting. Please. I'm desperate. Fine. I fold. Yay! Okay. It's gonna be so much fun. Hey, I said I'm coming. Don't push it. Okay. Sorry. See you tonight. Joan. Hey. Hey. What are you doing here? I had my lunch hour free. Just thought I'd check in. Hi. You expecting someone? Matter of fact, I am. Who? You. What? I knew you couldn't stay away. You had to check in on your little girl And your big girl. So you made all this? I did. Took me longer than it used to, But it's all edible, I think. Come here. It's good to have you back, soldier. ♪ You did this? No. Zach. Wow. He's like a pro with this stuff. Put together some clips of my old games. Yeah. It's great. I know, right? Yeah. I was thinking of sending it to coach Sullivan at Woodsen, Tell him I'm back on the ice. Perfect. You should. Yeah? Yes. Send it. Yeah. And while you're at it, Why don't you invite Zach for dinner? Mom. What? I'd like to meet the boy wonder. We're just friends. And we have your friends for dinner all the time. Unless you have something to hide. No. No? Well, then invite him. Okay, fine. I'll call him. Good. With the sheer volume of data We're now capable of transmitting, Efficiency suffers due to processing time. In short, we get buried.

The army's my career, Ms. Perkins. Oh, and you've had a great run. Uh, but what now? You know, not a lot of upward mobility for a two-star, And... unless you're angling for a Pentagon desk, And I'm guessing you're too independent for that. Don't be so sure. And there are other jobs. Not many. I mean, an 0-8's salary is enough To keep you in burgers and beer for as long as you like, But, general... Whew. With your background, You could make four or five times that In the private sector. I serve my country. Oh, so do we. Just from a different side of the street. And, general, I'm...

She's great with the kids. But she's so... Young, You know? Yeah, I know. Not like that. When I told her that I met the boss During his "born in the u.S.A." tour, She said, "well, I thought you weren't allowed to talk about work." You are making that up. I swear to God.

Uh, my professional offer. Whenever you're ready to discuss options outside the army, We're ready to listen. I'll keep that in mind. Travel safe. Thank you. So nothing happened. Uh-huh.

What do you mean, "a moment"? Well, he... We kissed. Oh, my God. No, it's not what you're thinking. It was really... It was very sweet. You know, we were relaxed, laughing. We had some beers. But I knew it was trouble, so I got out of there. Good for you. Mm. It wasn't easy, believe me. So how did Chase handle it? He's okay, I think. It just took us both by surprise.

You know, the doc says My handwriting may never fully recover. No, it's just one day at a time, wife. And for the record, I'm good with lime chips. See you. Say, "bye, daddy." Say "bye." Bye. Bye. Bye. Hey, Gabriel. What's going on? I don't know what I was thinking. I can't be seeing you. We're the same rank. It's okay. That's not what I'm talking about. Then what? I'm engaged, Jeremy.
