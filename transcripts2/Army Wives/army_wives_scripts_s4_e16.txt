 Army Wives (2007–2013): Season 4, Episode 16 - Mud, Sweat & Tears - full transcript 
 In Afghanistan, Jeremy is wounded and traumatized, but learns nurse Tanya Gabriel only pretended to be engaged to avoid admitting she started caring too much for him. Chase's patience with Pamela's absurd demands as if they were still together runs out. Pregnant Denise's two sisters Beth and Suzanne came to help her during pregnancy, but their sibling rivalry upsets the dynamics in the girls charity run team, which has to recruit both to replace Clausia Joy, who must receive the vice president's wife, and Emmalin, who gets a single chance to impress a talent scout.

Well, you haven't seen the rest of our team yet, 'cause we are gonna whup all y'alls butts. You wanna bet? Hell, yeah, we wanna bet. So if we beat them, they have to buy us a round, Wear army tees and sing "the armyong." Yeah, but if Ty beat us, We have to sing "thearine corps hymn" For them. Yeah, but that's not gonna happen... because of our secret weapon. Uh... About that... Malin spoke with her hockey coach Just before you got here. I mentioned the fun n, and he said, "no way." What? He doesn't allow his players To take unnecessary risks off the ice. He doesn't allow his players wh-what risks? Roxy, it's a... it's an obstacle course through the woods. So? You walk out on the stet, you can get hit by a bus. Emmalin, he cannot do this. Yclaudia joy, come on. There's gotta be something you can do here. Let go, Rox. This team captain thing's making her a little nuts. I'. Emmalin, he cannot do this. Yclaudia joy, come on. It's not your fault. You tried to help us out. I was just counting on you to be our ringer. I was, too. Okay, so Denise signed us up for the all-women division. We need to find a fourth woman. Right. Who? We can't think of a better person To beat the pants off the marines. Oh, and it's for a great cause, too. Oh, I wish I could, Roxy, but my doctors Still haven't cleared me for heavy exercise yet. Oh, m sorry. I-I didn't know. Oh, it's okay. It's a long road back, but I'm better. Anyway, I've agreed to be an official for the race. Oh, great. Well, we'll see you there, then. Mm-hmm. I'd ask Roland, but I think his schedule's full. Oh, it's okay. We're entered in the women's-only division. Oh. Do you think I could disguise him, Like in a wig or something? Roland in a wig? Forget it. Good luck. Right. Sisterhood is powerful. How much longer? Any second. My lips are killing me. Ooh. Ahh. Ooh. No good. I look fat. Oh. Let me see. No one can look fat next to me. Oh, it's fine. Mom's always asking for a good picture of us. Let's just e-mail it to her and dad. Oh, forget that. We'll have to print it and send it snail mail. I thought you bought them a computer. She did. And lessons. I think dad threw the guy out. You know dad. If the army didn't issue it, he has no use for it. And mom thinks a cursor is someone who swears. They get by. If you visited more often, Suzanne, you'd see for yourself. Yes, well, some of us have children to look after, Beth. Don't you mean some of us have children and husbands? Oh, for pity's sake. I wasn't commenting on your marital status. Really? All right, come on, guys. Why does she always have to bring up my divorce? Did you hear me mention her divorce? You know what? I think we're all hungry. Let's get something to eat, and we'll feel better, okay? Great. I got this. He... I got it. I got it. I know you're supposed to use your feet, But I'm no good at this. All right. Take it easy, bud. So, Sherwood, what's happening with you and that medic babe... Specialist Gabriel? It's Gabriel, and, uh, it's none of your business. Oh, a little touchy, aren't we? The last time I saw you two, it was all lovey-dovey. She has a fiancé. What? Back at home. She was playing you? Looks that way. That's harsh. Eagle three, this is eagle six. Come in. Over. Eagle three, this is eagle six. Come in. Over. Eagle six, this is eagle three. Over. Eagle three, video from u.A.V. Picked up a white pickup truck headed your way. Intel suggests possible threat. May have explosives on board. Over. Roger that, eagle six. White pickup, possible threat, may have explosives. Over. Use extreme force if necessary. All right, listen up. Watch the road. White truck, possible explosives. Target straight ahead! Everybody okay? Riggs? Roger, sergeant. Sherwood? Sherwood? I'm good, sergeant. Sherwood, you've been hit. Hell of an explosion. We felt it back here. Hell of an explosion. Sherwood. I'm fine. Wh... Take care of him. He needs it more than I do. Mmm. This gumbo is out of this world. Glad you like it. Fantastic. Best in all of Charleston. Oh, it's so nice you could visit. Denise talks about you all the time. Oh. Really? Which one of us? Oh, both of you. Let's see. Uh, Suzanne... Uh, you live in... Richmond. Richmond, yeah, And you are married to the... the banker. Banker. Oh, oh, yeah, right. With... with horses. And two children. Yes. And, Beth... Pittsburgh. No horses, no kids, no husband. Uh, what kind of work do you do? I'm an event planner. What happened to real estate? I'm on a new career path. Again? So, um, how is the fun run shaping up? Uh, not good. Emmalin's hockey coach won't let her do it. So now we are scrambling to find a replacement. What's the fun run? Uh, it's a footrace combined with an obstacle course, 4-man teams... To raise money to send kids to camp. Sounds like fun. That is what Denise said when she signed us up months ago. And now look at her. So if we don't find a fourth, then we have to drop out, Which means losing to this marine corps team, Which is driving me crazy. Heck, I'll do it. Really? Yeah, sure. I bike, run, hike. Oh, that's fantastic. I was about to say, I could do it. With your bad ankle? Oh, she was thrown from a horse. I wasn't thrown. It was a rough dismount. My ankle's fine now. Still, at your age, it takes longer to recover. I'd be happy to do it. I thought we came here for Denise. You know what? It's all right. I'm working the event anyway, so we'll all be there, And you can help me at the aid station. Super. Okay. So... Beth, uh, I have a form for you in my office. Let's get you signed up. Works for me. Me, too. You saved our butts. Notice how she never misses a chance to put me down? Suzanne... you heard her. "at your age"? Please. I think my 10k time is still better than hers. She used to hate being the youngest. Now she rubs my nose in it whenever she can. You have to cut her some slack. Beth doesn't have much going on right now. And that's my fault? No, of course not. And I love that martyr act about mom and dad. I mean, unlike Beth, I can't just drop everything to go visit. I mean, honestly, I don't think Mom and dad need all that attention she gives them. Come on. Relax. Let Beth enjoy the fun run. You and I will have our own fun on the sidelines, okay? I suppose. I found these all over the site, general. Remnants of detonator and trip wire, too. I.E.D. Components. Truck must've been full of 'em. Yeah, it blew up when our patrol fired on 'em. Everyone in the truck was killed instantly... Three insurgents. You keep me posted. Yes, sir. I want a report on civilian causalities. When it's appropriate, I want to visit the family That lost a father and son. Yes, sir. Sergeant Leblanc. Yes, general. I want to commend you and your team On your swift action today. Just doing our job, sir. Actually, it was specialist Sherwood Who fired the decisive shot. Where is Sherwood? He's at the aid station, sir. He's okay. He just took some shrapnel to the shoulder. Jeremy. Hey, dad. Hey. I'm fine. I'm fine. Just a few stitches, that's all. Well, keep it clean, huh? All right. Hey, sergeant Leblanc tells me You took out that hot target today. He's putting you in for a commendation. You okay? Yeah. Come on. It's your old man you're talking to. The, uh... The bomb blast, it killed some civilians... A father and son. I saw them, dad. It's not your fault. I just keep seeing 'em. Well, it's hard to get rid of those images. I know. But if you hadn't have done your job, There'd have been a lot more bodies out there today. I know. You want to get a coffee, talk it out? Nah, thanks. Dr. Burton and I worked out my plan. I'm gonna get to a session. I mean, I appreciate the offer, but... no, no, no. It's okay. I just want to make sure you're, you know, Taking care of things. Thanks, dad. Of course. I can imagine How difficult this is for you, coming to see me. Look, all of your training has been to make you tough, Self-sufficient, Shut down any feelings that get in the way of the mission. And therapy is the opposite. Here the goal is to get in touch with your emotions, Let your feelings lead. I get that, but I'm not here for therapy, doc. You're not? Just looking for a little advice is all. But now that I'm here, I'm thinking, this is a mistake. Why is that? Uh, I'm not into head shrinking. No offense. Besides, you're friends with my wife... My ex-wife. Look, I can assure you That whatever is said here stays between us. What kind of advice are you looking for? I don't know. I should go. Hey, Chase, whatever you want to call this... Therapy, advice... it doesn't matter to me. But something brought you here, and maybe I can help. So what's on your mind? I don't know. Uh, it feels like I'm stuck or something. I just want to move on. From your marriage? A lot of people Have difficulty getting back into the dating game After a long marriage. Well, how about after a good marriage? You sound angry. I'm not angry. Confused, maybe. Confused? Look, I was a good husband, A good father. I was faithful. I provided. Okay. So what was the problem? Exactly. Pamela wasn't happy. She wanted me to leave delta. And that makes you angry? I told you, I am not angry. You're not? Well, wouldn't you be? We're not talking about me. Will you be going back to work after Molly comes? Of course she won't. Kids do best when there's a parent at home, And that can't be Frank. So that's it? Frank gets his career, and Denise gets nothing? Well, she can go back to work later. But she struggled to find something she likes. And now she's having a child. Who will benefit from a strong female role model. Are you saying that stay-at-home moms Aren't strong role models, Beth? Excuse me. Hello. Denise. I have a problem. What's going on? Dr. Biden wants to visit more locales on post tomorrow, And I'd love to escort her, But that means I'd have to drop out of the fun run. Well, you have to go with Dr. Biden. It's an honor for you and the post. I know, I know, But I don't want to disappoint Roxy and Pamela either. We all know how hard your life is, Beth, But this isn't about you. Okay? It's about Denise. I have an idea. Dr. Biden, we're so honored You're taking the time to meet some of our blue star wives. The honor's mine, Claudia joy. I understand your husbands are all deployed. And my son, too. I know what that's like. My son served a tour in Iraq. Mm. And you're having a new addition, I see. Yes, ma'am. One of the things I value most about my role as second lady Is the opportunity to visit with military families. I'm here to listen to what's ever on your mind. I want this to be an open conversation. And I hope you'll feel comfortable Sharing your stories... The good ones and the challenging ones. Well, this isn't like me, Dr. Biden, But for once in my life, I am speechless. I think we all are. I'll get the ball rolling. Uh... We all know How much stress our soldiers endure, But I think it's safe to say That it's a big problem for the families, too. When to tell our kids about deployment And what to tell them. And there's the stress when they're gone, Worrying about them every day. I know that feeling. The important thing Is to realize, you're not alone. And when you need help, say so. What else? My biggest challenge is taking care of the kids. Between carpool, soccer, dance lessons, Uh, it really is a 2-person job. I hear that from military spouses all the time. Parenting is hard enough when both parents are around, Which is why I'm so glad You have this great support network here at fort Marshall. Well, that's because of Claudia joy. mm-hmm. Well, it's because we have each other. That's nice to hear. We all have to rely on each other. Does anyone else have anything they'd like to add? ♪ I like the way ♪ ♪ you're not afraid ♪ ♪ you've got the world planned ♪ ♪ in your mind ♪ ♪ people say ♪ ♪ you cannot do it ♪ ♪ but they don't know ♪ ♪ a friend like you ♪ Oh, I hate to bring this to a close, But I need to get Dr. Biden to the start of our fun run. It's been my pleasure. Let me just say that the white house appreciates All that you and your families do every day for our country. On behalf of the president, the first lady, The vice president and myself, thank you. Okay. Sure. Yeah. Good afternoon, And welcome to our inaugural fort Marshall fun run. I'm Claudia joy holden, Head of the family readiness group At fort Marshall, And it is my great honor to introduce to you The wife of our vice president, and a military mother herself, Dr. Jill biden. Thank you. I'm proud to be here today as the second lady, But I'm even more proud to be here as a military mom. I have traveled to many military bases And met countless soldiers and their families, And I have been truly overwhelmed By the courage of our men and women in uniform And inspired by the patriotism and pride of their families. As many of you know, The first lady and I have been working To raise awareness of the service and sacrifices Of our men and women in uniform and their families. Our goal is to help forge An enduring national commitment to supporting them. This includes building stronger ties Between our civilian and military communities. Although only 1% of Americans are fighting our wars today, We need 100% of Americans To support them and their families. By being here, You are doing exactly that, And I thank you. Now... Who's ready for the fun run? Okay, runners. Take your places. Good luck. You, too. They're gonna need it. Ready. Set. Looks doable. Definitely. Ready? Wow. Look at 'em go. Man, did we luck out or what? Welcome to your orienteering challenge. From here, you are required to follow this map Using nothing more than this compass And your own common sense To get to this clearing. It is distinguished by an old water well. Now the race official there must validate your map Before moving on to the next event. Clear? Yeah, yeah. Yes, yes. Oh. Uh, actually, I'm a girl scout leader back home. Yeah, but Pamela's a cop. No, Roxy. It's okay. Really, Suzanne? You get lost at the mall. Oh, come on. That happened once. Okay, let's just go. Come on. We're wasting time. It's that way. That way. Let's go. Which way? Um... Uh, right. No. Left. You're wrong. What? See? They're going left. it doesn't matter. Different teams have different checkpoints. I say we go right. Pamela? A team can only have one leader at a time. We gave Suzanne the map. She should lead. Thank you. I don't recall voting on that. Oh, God! Just make a decision. Let's go. Come on. Left. Okay. Left. Come on. That doesn't look like a water well. It should be here. Well, maybe if we'd gone right instead of left, it would be. Maybe there's a problem with the map. Yeah, it has a faulty map reader. Can it, you two. Somebody screwed up. So we gotta retrace our steps And get back to the fork in the trail right now. If we hustle, we can make up for lost time, Find the well, and then run like hell to the next stop... The challenge wall. Challenge wall? Uh, we have to get over that? Where's the ladder? I guess that's the challenge. Exactly right. The idea is for all four of you to get over it any way you can. Okay, well, let's do this. Roxy, you okay? Yeah, that's not gonna work. Look, we can only do this as a team. Suzanne, give me a boost. Well, why don't you give me a boost? I'm lighter. Well, I'm stronger. That's why you should give me the boost. The stronger one needs to get to the top first To help the others get up there. It's not just about strength. It takes agility, too. What's your point? Hello? Yoga. I'm much more flexible... hey! It worked. Okay. Anytime, ladies. Come on. Give me a boost. Oh. Here. And... Me next. Would it kill you to go last? Quit arguing. Beth, you're next. You're punishing me for going left, aren't ya? Yeah, we are. Can you just do it? Yeah. Gosh. All right. You ready? Okay. Haul ass, Suzanne. All right. And... Move it. I'm going. I'm going. Come on, Beth. We're falling behind. Oh, this is not easy. Quiet, I'm concentrating. Oh, for Pete's sake. You know how to walk, don't you? Just put one foot ahead of the other. What are you doing? Get going. Back off, Suzanne. You know how to back off, don't you? You just... Quit yapping and just cross the damn log! Tell her. You're still yapping. Aah! Oh! Oh, bravo. Now we gotta start all over again. Come on. It's your fault! Oh, my fault? I'm not the one who fell off the log. Yeah? I can't believe you did that! Oh, would you shut up?! Get up! You are wasting time. Come on. What's taking 'em so long? The marine wives came through 15 minutes ago. Let's go. What the... Ah. Well, there's no point in moving on Until your sisters work out Whatever the hell is wrong with them. Why? What happened now? Ask them. She started it. Me? Okay, stop. I've had it. I cannot believe you two. You can't even have fun at a fun run. It wasn't my fault. I don't care whose fault it was. I am sick and tired of playing referee. "Beth said this." "Suzanne did that." Do you know how embarrassing it is To watch the two of you behave like this? When are you gonna grow up? You said you came to keep me company, To help me through my pregnancy, but all you've done Is make me miserable since the minute you got here. And... and now you've ruined this race for my friends, Who are more like sisters to me than you ever were. Denise. It's true. Just go home. Let her go. Where's the next station? What does it matter? We told her we'd do this. So let's do this. For Denise. Sorry. Okay. This way. Shooting insurgents, that's my job. But those civilians... I know I didn't kill them, but they dieds... Because of what I did. And it's hard getting those images out of my head. A father and son... I think of my mom, you know? How would she feel if that happened to our family? Talking about it is the best way to heal. I know, and I'm working on it. But I could still feel a bit of, uh, pull, you know, From that negative feeling that I had before. And I know what I need to do. I have to admit it and not fight it. I have to admit what I'm feeling and deal with it, Which is why I'm here. Hey, Sherwood. Got a minute? What for? What you said in group... You were very honest. And I haven't been. I don't have a fiancé back home. I don't have a boyfriend either. There's no one. I don't get it. Well, it was easier than telling you the truth. Which is? I'm a short-timer. I rotate home in three weeks. Okay. S-so? I have a green to gold scholarship, Jeremy. I'm going home to finish out my undergrad degree, Then I'm heading straight to med school, All on the army's dime. I still don't get what that has to do with me. The last thing I need is a relationship. I promised myself I wouldn't get involved with anyone over here. And then I met you, and... And then there were those casualties the other day, And I thought it could be you, and... I'm not getting involved with a soldier. I hear that. But just tell me that you don't have any feelings for me. It doesn't matter what I feel. There's no future for us, Jeremy. I'm sorry. Hey, Roxy, look! The marines are barely ahead of us. Son of a gun. Maybe they have a pair of sisters, too. Very funny. We can still beat 'em. Double time! God! You okay, Suzanne? Yeah, yeah. Oh, no. Oh, God. I think it might be sprained. Your bad ankle? Oh, my God. You are kidding me. I think you're right. I don't heal as fast as I used to. You guys should go without me. It's tempting, but we have to finish as a 4-person team. Oh, there must be some exception for injuries. Oh, we are so close. There'so gotta be something we can do. What? We can't carry her. Oh, gosh. Hey! I know. Beth, give me your sweatshirt. Suzanne, you, too. what? Come on. No woman left behind, right? And here come The marine corps' entry... the leatherneck ladies! Whoo-hoo! We beat army! Hey, look. Someone's hurt. Here comes the army... Roxy's rangers! Um, you guys, stop, please. I-I want to cross the finish line On my own two feet. Or at least on one foot. I'll help you, Suzanne. Grab hold of me. Okay. I got you. Hey. Congratulations, guys. We made it. Damn right. Hey, where's Denise? Enter. Preliminary report on yesterday's action, sir. Thank you. Glad to hear your son's okay. Oh, thank you, sir. Intel suggests the insurgents wanted to counteract The progress we've made in that village. But the villagers are still with us? Despite their losses, they are. We need to build that kind of support all over. Have something in mind, sir? I do. The army has had trouble Making inroads with the tribal leaders At the eastern end of the province. I want to see those villages myself, Meet the leaders face-to-face. That region's still considered unstable, sir. I met that afghan family an hour ago, The one that lost a father and son in yesterday's action. Despite their grief, they thanked me for coming. And it reminded me that, in winning this battle, There is nothing more important than human contact. Yes, sir. Set it up. Will do, sir. Thank you. Hey, guys. Hey, mom. Hey. Uh, everything go okay? Yeah. Uh, they both still have homework to do. Oh, well, hop to it, Because I'm taking you guys to the Leblancs' later. We're going to t.J. And Finn's? Yeah, emmalin's gonna watch you guys While mommy and Mrs. Leblanc Have a little fun run celebration. Cool. Bye, dad. Bye. Okay, bye. I'll see you next weekend, okay? Okay. Okay. I drop them off, and you're leaving 'em with a babysitter? Yeah, well, the kids will get to hang out, And it's all set with Roxy. But thank you so much For taking them today. Well, why wouldn't I? I'm their father. I know, but it wasn't your day. You did me a favor, and I appreciate it. I don't understand why you got a babysitter. I coulda kept 'em tonight. Yeah. I didn't want to inconvenience you. Why would it inconvenience me? Listen, it was just a last-minute thing. Um, but I don't know what your deal is, But if you want, I can take the kids next Saturday. There's this carnival, and I thought... no, I don't want that. I already have plans with the kids next weekend. Okay, well, I was just thinking that... It's not always about what you want, Pamela. I never said it was. The hell you didn't. Chase, calm down. I was just... No, I'm not gonna calm down, okay? Listen, I was... What? What's with you? What is with me is that I don't have to do things your way anymore. My way? I don't care what you want. I don't care. I... what? The kids are with me next weekend. Hey, babe. You need me to pick anything up? All right. I'll see you in a bit. Chase. Hey. I normally don't see patients after hours. That advice you gave me? Looking at my feelings? Didn't work out so well. Why? What happened? I don't know. I just lost it with Pamela. I don't even know what I said, but it wasn't good. I keep running through things in my head... The divorce, the house, the kids... And I get more and more pissed off about what she did. Well, what did she do? What did he do? She ruined our life together, ruined our family. Hey, can we talk about this at our next session, Give it the time it deserves? There's not gonna be another "next session," man. That's my point. All this does is make me angrier. Maybe that's a sign of progress. Oh, yeah? Yeah, Chase. Look, this is all new territory for you. There's nothing easy about therapy. You need to take a look At where that anger is really coming from. What is that supposed to mean? All right. Have you ever considered that maybe One of the reasons you're so angry with Pamela Is that you're angry with yourself? That's crap. Maybe some of the choices you made Helped to end the marriage. Have you thought about it that way? I knew it. You're taking her side. No, this is not about sides. It is about sides. This was a big mistake. Look, chase... sorry to bother you, doc. Won't happen again. This is all my fault. I shouldn't have invited myself when I heard Suzanne was coming. No, it's my fault for telling you. I think I wanted you to feel left out. Aren't you tired of making each other feel bad? It's been going on so long, we quit thinking about it. Until you said we weren't like sisters to you. I didn't mean to be so hurtful. I was just... You don't have to say anything. I just want us to enjoy being together. There always so much bickering in the house, And I was always in the middle. We feel terrible. Well, you know what? It was partly my fault. I never stood up for myself, And it took me a long time to learn how. Honey, I've always admired your gentleness. And your sense of fairness. We both thought of you as the strong one. That's funny. I never felt that way. Look at your life, your family, your friends. You are strong, Denise. You've made good choices. Thank you. I'm sorry. I-I've been so stupid. Me, too. Come here. Oh, I'm sorry.

I don't know what to do about it. And what did your sergeant tell you? To leave you alone. That's good advice. Jeremy. Look, if I've learned anything, It's that life is precious... And it can slip away in an instant, So you have to make the most of it right now. And if three weeks is all we have together, I'll take it, no strings. And if I'm wrong...
