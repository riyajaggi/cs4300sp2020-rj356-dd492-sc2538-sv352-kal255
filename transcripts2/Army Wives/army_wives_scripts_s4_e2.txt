 I expect you'll have a little blurriness In your left eye. My left? I thought my right took most of the damage. It did. Let me go over it again, okay? You were a little out of it the last time we spoke. Both of your eyes were damaged by debris from the r.P.G. Now the left was scratched, but it should heal by itself. And my right? The damage was more extensive. During surgery, we decided to replace the cornea. Now the good thing about that is, you should actually Be able to see better out of that eye immediately.

 Hmm? Ready? Okay. Go ahead. Open up. How's the vision? Blurry. Both eyes? Well, let's just try the right. How about now? I can't see. They got strollersin here. I mean, for that kind of money, it should push itself. I bet they're cheaper at the p.X. Well, it doesn't matter if they are. We gotta beg, borrow and steal everything we can Before we spend a dime on anything new. Besides, you can't go poking around the p.X., 'cause I haven't told anybody about the baby yet. Rox, you're killin' me. Why haven't you told your friends yet? When was I supposed to tell 'em? After jeremy tried to shoot himself? Oh, or when pamela left chase? Or maybe I should've done it... okay, okay. I get it. Just don't let other people's stuff stress you out. It's not good for the baby. I'm not stressed about other people's stuff. I'm stressed about my own stuff. Like the ban on the hump bar. The mustang's on its last legs. We gotta get all this new baby gear. Babe, I got a plan. oh, really? Mm-hmm. What's that, a bake sale? That's funny, but no. I'm getting a second job. What? A lot of guys moonlight. Yeah, but you work 24/7 as it is. Oh, come on. It's not that bad. I just gotta find something with flexible hours. I got a couple things lined up already. No, I don't want you to have to... oh, no, no, no. Shh. Come here. Babe, I want to do this, okay? It's for our family. Besides, it's only temporary, Till the hump gets back on its feet. If the hump gets back on its feet. Wow. Okay. You need to tell your mom to re-lax. Daddy's got everything under control. Mwah. I love you. I'll see you tonight. Okay. Why don't you get a job, huh? Your kibble isn't free, you know? Hey, you look at me when I'm talking to you. Yes, I treated him last year. When was he admitted? Okay. I'll be by for a consult this afternoon. Thank you. Your wife. Line two. Joan? They take the bandages off today? Yeah, they took 'em off. And? They put 'em back on. Wh-what? Yeah, I'm... I'm having a little bit of difficulty seeing. Uh... The doctor says I just need more time to heal. That's all. Well, that sounds right. Everybody heals differently. Joan? What's going on, babe? I'm scared, roland. I'm... I'm really scared. I wish I was there with you. Me, too. All the shoes against the wall. That's perfect. I'll fold 'em. Hey. Got another batch for ya. Thanks, pamela. Women's or... No? Yeah. Doesn't really have a size in it. Hmm. So, pamela, how are things with you and chase? Well... He left yesterday For special training at fort carson, So I'd have to say, not great. Um, mom? Can I go to a party tonight at heather's? Parents? Yes. Me by 11:00. Midnight? 11:30. Have fun. thank you. I should get going. I'm meeting frank at the hospital. Oh, well, give jeremy our love. From all of us. aw. Absolutely. I will. See you guys later, okay? Okay. this is the clothing drive program I started when general baker and I ran the post. Oh, it's so nice to see the tradition Being carried on by all these wonderful young wives... And claudia joy. Nice to see you, lenore. I thought the spenser awards committee would be interested In some of the programs that I initiated at fort marshall. Oh. Oh, you know what they say, dear... A picture is worth a thousand words. Hey, keep up the good work, ladies. Well... I thought we'd visit the memorial rose garden next. I mean, it was my design, you know? I supervised the planting myself. Is this good? Some things never change. Oh, she's changed all right. Now that she bagged general big shot, She's ten times worse. Oh, forget lenore. We've got work to do. Oh. Hey. Hey. Hi. Banana bread! Your favorite. Aw. Well, you look... you look good. You look good. You feeling better? Yes, sir. Dr. Burton says I should be able to check out in a day or two. Really? Well, I'll still be seeing him twice a week, And I'm, uh, part of this therapy group now, But, um, I don't need to be in here to do any of that. Not saying everything's perfect, But it's a whole lot better. Well, that's... that's fantastic. We're very proud of you. Look, I wanted to, um... I wanted to apologize For all the trouble that I've caused. Honey... Please, mom, I screwed up bad. And I know it's been hard on you. Both of you. We appreciate that. But what... What's most important to your mother and me Is that you're okay, all right? Nothing else matters. Nothing. You got that? Thank you, dad. None of this gets fed to the dog. I mean it, finn. If I find one crumb on that mangy mutt, You are in big trouble. Yes, ma'am. What? Yes, ma'am! Okay. So what have you told the kids? Nothing. I mean, what's to tell? I'm just pretending everything's okay When it's not. Mm. Believe me, before trevor, I did a lot of pretending. "your daddy loves you, Even though he doesn't want to see you again." Somehow they still turned out okay. It always drove me crazy... Women complaining about being army wives. Even got me kicked off the radio. Now look at me. Well, it's different. Chase is the one that changed, not you. You never gave us anything to drink. Oh, right. Sorry. Okay. Be careful with that. When is dad coming home? Not until after you're asleep. Now get. We need some grown-up time. Why so late? Trevor took a second job. You're kidding. Doing what? Ah, ah, I got it. I'm coming! I'm coming. Oh. Sergeant leblanc. Emmalin. Uh, two pepperonis and a veggie special? Wake up. Wakey, wakey. Oh, no, babe. It's too early. No. I know, but I was asleep When you got home last night. You smell a little bit like pizza. Sausage or pepperoni? Both. Mm. How'd your first night go? Um... Mm. It was okay. I delivered three pies to emmalin holden. What? I thought you weren't gonna deliver on post. She was at a party off post. What? Now she's gonna tell claudia joy. So what if she does? It's not like I'm the only guy in the army with a second job. I know, but it's claudia joy. I don't want her thinking that we can't handle our money. Babe, she's not gonna think that. Look, it happened. It's not a big deal, okay? Mm. Hey, don't forget, I got that pentagon trip next week. D.? Hmm? What are you looking at? College guide. I figured jeremy would want to go back to school Once he's discharged. And he always loved- loved architecture. What are you talking about? The boy's going back to the barracks. The barracks? He's getting a medical discharge, isn't he? What for? He almost killed himself. Yeah. But he's better now. All right? You said so yourself. No, I said, "he looks better." That doesn't make him fit for duty, frank. You just don't get over something like this. I know, but you do keep moving forward. He's got a commitment, d. He's got a contract, and he's gotta honor that. I'm sure he would say the same thing. He would say anything to please you, frank! You know that. Now that's not fair. That's not fair. Well... The boy can make his own decisions. He's confused, frank. He doesn't know what he wants. He hasn't known that for a long time. Well, I disagree. Oh, frank. Well, we both have faith in roland. If he says that jeremy's ready, We just have to trust him, don't we? Jeremy is his patient... Not his son. Uh, dr. Sander called. He wants a consult on Friday at 9:00. Your 2:00 needs to reschedule for tomorrow, And you have a walk-in, referred by dr. West. Dr. Burton? I'm sorry, patty. You want to give that to me again? Only if you listen this time. Knock, knock. Can we talk? Yeah. Uh, five minutes, patty. Come on in. Hey. Sorry to bother you. No. What's up? Uh... Frank tells me that jeremy will be returning To his unit when he leaves the hospital. Is that true? Uh, it's not up to me to decide. That's the army's call. But you make a recommendation, don't you? I-I can't discuss specifics. I'm not asking for specifics, roland. I just want to know If my son is returning to duty or not. My immediate responsibility was to determine Whether jeremy continues to pose a threat to himself or others. And? In my opinion, no, he doesn't. So the decision's been made. Uh, the final decision's up to his c. O. We'll know tomorrow. Tomorrow. He's made remarkable progress in a short period of time. You should be proud of him. I am proud of him, roland, But this is his chance to start over, And once he's declared fit for duty, that chance is gone. I need him to get a medical discharge. Denise, I understand you wanting to protect your son. But the army asked for my professional opinion, And I stand by it. Why do I feel like I'm the crazy one here? My... my son almost killed himself Because of what happened in combat, And all we've done is patch him up So that he can fall apart again! Does that make any sense at all? It is possible for soldiers to recover from battlefield trauma. Look at joan. She was able to face her problems, get help, And now everything is... yeah, now she's laying in a hospital bed in germany. Do you think I don't worry about her every minute? You have no idea what I'm going through. Oh, roland, I'm... I'm so sorry. That was incredibly insensitive of me. Is everything okay? No, denise. It's not. What happened? She can't see. Look, we all worry about our soldiers, But there's nothing you can do about it. There's absolutely nothing. Roland, I'm so sorry. I should be there with her. But you stayed to take care of my son. Roxy, hey. Hey! I was just picking up a couple things. Dog food's on sale. Not that you would care, 'cause you don't have a dog. You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Great. Terrific. How are you? Fine. Okay. Roxy... Okay, look, I know you know, And I know that it shouldn't matter, But it does, because it's you. I mean, if it were pamela or denise, even, fine, But, I mean, it had to be your daughter. What are the odds, right? Emmalin didn't tell you, did she? This isn't like you to be embarrassed like this. Hey, I get embarrassed. Roxy, the first time I met you, You were walking out of a bathroom stall, Wearing only a thong. That's what I admire about you. You don't care what other people think. Well, I didn't know you then. It made it a lot easier not to care. I think you're an amazing woman... Fierce, funny, Loyal, unique... And completely nuts if you think Something as silly as trevor moonlighting Could affect our friendship. Okay, okay, but think about it. Hmm. You're the general's wife. I am the pizza guy's wife. I wasn't always the general's wife. When michael and I first got married, We had tough times, too. Really? Yes. So what's going on? I thought things were okay. Things were okay, Until the army put the ban on the hump bar. Look, no offense, claudia joy, But I didn't deserve to get closed down. I mean, maybe some of those other places did, but not me. It's not my fault that jeremy picked a fight With that councilwoman's son... Mm. Yet I'm the one being punished. I know. And it's not like the army made anything better either. What do you mean by that? Well, they just moved the problem up the road. I mean, every day, you read about another drunk soldier Who got into a wreck on route 52, right? Mm. Meanwhile, my business is in the toilet, My bills are getting bigger, I've got the baby, and now... Whoa. Baby? You're pregnant? Uh... Yeah. I am. Ohh. Oh, roxy, come here. Come here! Why haven't you told anyone? Well, I just keep waiting for the right time, And then all hell breaks loose. Oh. I just need everyone to be okay before I tell. Your secret's safe with me. Ohh! We considered all the circumstances When we imposed the ban. I know. It was politically expedient. Maybe it's time to reevaluate. How would it look if I lifted the ban On just one establishment, run by a friend of yours? If it was the right decision, I think it would be easy to explain. Michael, I didn't press you at the time Because you asked me not to, but roxy is really struggling, And, frankly, I don't think it's fair. There is a reason we implemented the ban, claudia joy. There are real problems... Drunk and disorderlies, d. U.I.S... And the ban hasn't stopped any of those things. Roxy said there's been a huge increase Of d.U.I. S outside the strip now. You know I'm briefed on every serious incident Involving a soldier. Of course. And? And my staff is looking into it. Michael, we both know that's code for "they'll get to it when they get to it." If, in fact, we have a new problem on our hands, Then we will deal with it, But the underlying issues on the strip haven't changed, And until they do, the ban stays. Okay. Claudia joy. We just can't seem to avoid each other, can we? I know. I was just stopping by to see general ludwig... Mm. And I thought, wouldn't the grand staircase Make a lovely backdrop for a portrait? Yes, it would. Please... Don't let me keep you. Mm. I'm looking for data Since the ban was imposed. We don't usually break out blotter information That way, ma'am. Oh, I know. I understand. But you could do it, couldn't you, specialist? I know general holden would really appreciate it. Yes, ma'am. I-I'll get right on that. Thank you so much. Let's take another look. Wait. Sure. What if I still can't see? Then we reevaluate. But I have to tell you, colonel, I have a pretty good success rate. I think your eye just needed a little more time To adjust to the new cornea. You let me know when you're ready. Ready. ♪ Hold onto hope, love ♪ ♪ I've searched ♪ ♪ high and low for you ♪ ♪ for you ♪ ♪ each day gets closer ♪ ♪ so hold on stronger to me ♪ ♪ and you ♪ ♪ someday soon ♪ ♪ I'll find you ♪ Roland? ♪ I'll know you ♪ Can you see me, baby? ♪ Someday ♪ yes, I can see you. I can see you. I can see you! Oh, my gosh. What did you... I caught a hop with the 437. Michael arranged it. I can't believe it. I'm sorry I couldn't bring the baby. You're here. You're really here. ♪ Yes, sir, those files are on the way. Excuse me, specialist. Was mrs. Holden just here? Yes, ma'am. Oh, shoot. I was hoping I'd catch her. We're working on a project together. Did she already get the information from you? The blotter information for general holden? Yes, exactly. It's going to take me a little while To generate the documents, But I can call you when they're ready. Perfect. Thank you so much for meeting me. Of course. It was outstanding, what you did for roland and joan. Oh, I was happy to do it. Yeah. Of course, now we all have babysitting duty Until he gets back. right. You said this was about jeremy. Yeah, he's, uh... He's gonna be released from the hospital soon. I heard. That's great news. It is, but I've thought about it, and... I don't want him to go back to active duty. It's just not right. Jeremy was never cut out to be a soldier. Denise... Look, a medical discharge Would give him a second chance, michael. I know I'm way out of line here, But you're the only person who can help me now. I'm asking you... I'm begging you, as a mother to a father... my family has already given enough to the army. Please just let me have my son back. I'm sorry, denise. Really, I am. But I cannot release a soldier Who's been declared fit for duty. No, it's not official. You could stop that. I can't... I can't do that. I know that you're concerned, But so is every parent of every soldier. They all want to keep their kids safe, But the reality is, Their sons and daughters chose a very dangerous profession, And we should thank god for that, Because our country stands on their shoulders. The hardest part of my job is sending soldiers to war, Knowing that some of 'em won't be coming back. But what gives me the strength to carry on Is a belief in what we're doing. Frank and jeremy share that belief. It's a course we've chosen, For ourselves, for our families, Which means, We need to be brave for each other. That's not what you want to hear, But it is the only answer I can give. Denise... What does jeremy have to say about all this? What do you mean? Have you asked him what he wants? No. Maybe you should. Did you get it? Oh, I got it, baby. Mint chocolate chip. Yes! Mmm. Mmm. I can't imagine anything better in the world right now. You can't? 'cause I can. Roland, we are in a hospital. I thought we were talking imagination. You haven't mentioned anything about my new look. That's true. It's a little asymmetrical. Could use so work on the other side. I'm serious. You're alive, joan. There's nothing more beautiful than that. I want you to like what you see When you look at me. I do. Ahem. Oh. Hey, doc. Pull up a spoon. I sense a disturbing lack of discipline In this room, colonel, But I think I can overlook it just this once. Indulge me. Good. Good. Everything looks great. How's it feel? Like my own eye. What is this cornea, some kind of plastic? It's a donor cornea from a cadaver. A cadaver? Mm-hmm. He was a soldier. A soldier? Who? What unit? I'm afraid I can't tell you that. Confidential. Now you get some rest, hmm? I'll check back tomorrow. Doctor. Joan? I wanted to see again, roland. I prayed that I would see again, But... Not because another soldier died. Hey, you can't think about it that way. I know, but here we are, And... and somewhere out there, a family is... I want to know who he was. I want his family to know That his death meant something to me. Buy you a drink, soldier? I'm married. Mm. Bet your wife doesn't understand you. Mm. Colonel reed's running a little late. Well, look at the lovebirds! Lenore. Sir. Mike. Claudia joy. How are you? Glad I ran into you. It's come to my attention that you're considering Lifting the ban on one of the bars on the strip. No, sir, that's not correct. Really? You're not preparing a report on the subject? It's not just one bar, sir. All of the businesses affected by the ban Have lobbied for a review. I thought it would be prudent for community relations To let them make their case. It may be We inadvertently created a worse situation for our soldiers. Corrective measures may be called for. Well, we certainly don't want our soldiers suffering, do we? Uh, however, I am concerned About the appearance of influence peddling. Now I don't mean to sound indelicate, But I have heard that one of the bar owners Is a close friend of claudia joy's. What was her name again? Oh, you know the one, claudia joy... Tattoo and miniskirt. Her name is roxy leblanc. Her husband's a sergeant. And, yes, we're friends. And I would never do anything That goes against the army's best interests. Of course not. Still, I feel that I should be in on this discussion. Now I'm going to washington tomorrow night. How's a meeting at 1400 sound? I'll have my staff set it up, sir. Excellent. If you'll excuse us, our dinner guests are here. Certainly. Enjoy your dinner. Thank you. Be sure to wish roxy lots of luck for me. Mm-hmm. bye now. Good night. Good night. What the hell was that? I was trying to gather data on the ban. Lenore must've found out somehow. Michael, I'm sorry. I thought it would save time If I could analyze the numbers myself, See if the ban has been effective. Well, now you have 18 hours to make your case. I can't tell you how much this means to me. I just wish we had more time. Seriously, I-I can't thank you enough. Well, let's get the ban lifted before we start celebrating. okay. I'll wrangle the numbers. You wrangle your fellow bar owners. Are you sure I can't wrangle the numbers instead? The other bar owners are... We're not exactly talking the chamber of commerce here. Roxy, dial. We all need to beef up security. The army was real specific about that. So I'm thinking, we need to agree To install security cameras inside and out, And I called around, And we can get the stuff cheaper if we order as a group. How much is this gonna cost, rox? Look, I'm not gonna lie. It's gonna cost. But it's an investment. We get the ban lifted, we get our customers back. Well, some of us will, anyway. Your customers probably figured out by now That whiskey ain't supposed to taste like water. All right, listen up. I've been around the army a long time. Believe me, if you don't have a battle plan, you're through. Now you've got one shot at this, So you can either keep on bickering And go down one by one, or you can stick together And maybe, maybe survive as a group. Okay, you have two choices- you listen to roxy, Or there's the door. You can use it. Understood? Good. The policy is there to protect privacy. Uh, ma'am, I understand. My wife just wants to write a thank-you letter, Like any soldier in her position would. Yes, and as I explained, she's welcome to do so, And we'll pass it on- anonymously. "to whom it may concern"? I'm sorry, but that's not good enough. We need a name. It's totally against regs, dr. Burton. Excuse me. I'm sorry. If it was joan who wasn't coming home, I'd sure as hell want the other family to know Who had made the sacrifice. She just wants to know who to thank. Dr. Burton. There's something that I'd like to show you. I started collecting these a couple weeks after I got here. Always seemed to cheer them up. And I like having something to remember them all by. Reminds me why I'm here. Um... There. That's him. The top one. Staff sergeant jack summerlin. Lost both his legs to an I.E.D. Significant burns. And we did everything we could. Uh, it was the infection that got him. He talked a lot about his family. Most do. He had two boys and a girl on the way. And he was real excited about that... Having a girl. I think his wife would want you to know who he was. They're here. I think I'm gonna throw up. I-I heard on tv once That if you're nervous in front of people, Just picture 'em naked. Yeah. I'm not gonna do that. General ludwig, general holden, welcome. Thank you for coming. Thank you, ma'am. We don't have much time. If we could get straight to your presentation? Sure. Uh, why don't you all come in and sit down? Uh, bear, grab the lights, will ya? Let's start with an overview. Here we have the stats for soldier d.U.I.S Before the ban... And we have superimposed the stats for after the ban. This is our signed code of conduct That lays out our plan. We like to call it "the three e's"... Educate, enforce, encourage. First, educate... The charleston police department's gonna conduct Special training sessions for all our employees To show them how to spot fake I.D.S, Control unruly customers and... Well, it's all listed there. You can read it. It's pretty cool. Bouncers will be present at all times. Uh, security cameras will be installed And properly maintained, And the parkining lots will have better lighting. In addition to these increased security measures, We have all agreed to enforce drink limits To cut people off sooner rather than later. And finally, in the area of encouragement, We are gonna provide free shuttle to the front gate For all soldiers who shouldn't be driving. That's very impressive, but I don't know many soldiers Who want to be seen by their buddies Getting into a shuttle. It's... Kind of a pride thing. Uh, yeah. We thought of that, too, but roxy had the best idea ever. I'd like you to meet our shuttle drivers. We call 'em "roxy's angels." I think your soldiers are gonna want to take this ride. Don't you? Left. Left. First, on behalf of the army, I want to thank you for your presentation yesterday. It was thorough and professional. However, that does not mean That we agree with all of your findings. Some of your evidence was anecdotal at best. Nevertheless, Your proposals are both sensible and... Imaginative. It's clear you're making a good faith effort To resolve the army's issues, So we have decided to rescind the ban on a provisional basis. Um... English, please. We're lifting the ban. But we want to see six months without serious incident. Do we have a deal? Hell, yeah! I mean, heck, yeah! We did it! Oh, yay! Oh! Down, bear. Down, down. Okay! Down. Sorry. Little excited. It's okay. Yeah. Uh, mrs. Holden, There is a frosty one waiting for you and the general Down at the cherry pit anytime you want. That's very sweet, bear. Thank you. Well, I got a bar to run! bye. Okay. Congratulations! Hey, it was all you. Oh, we make a good team. Yeah. But we knew that already, didn't we? Well done. My goodness, congratulations must be in order. Thank you, claudia joy, for once again Making the world safe for... Tarts in tank tops. Uh... thank you, lenore. We never would've gotten that meeting if it weren't for you. Oh, just trying to keep the soldiers' best interests At heart. aren't we all? Yeah. See ya later. Bye. Ugh. Go slither back under your rock. Let it go. Ugh. Oh! I gotta go! I-I gotta double my beer order... Oh. And cook up some gumbo... mmm. And hire another waitress. Thank you. Oh. Thank you, thank you. Okay, okay. Go! Right. Okay. Have fun. Hey. Hi. Checking up on me? Yeah, as a matter of fact, I am. Big step, huh? Going back? Yeah. You sure you're ready? Well, dr. Burton says that with things like this, You don't really get over it, you just get on with it, So... That's what I'm trying to do- - get on with it. Are you okay? I mean, are you really okay? Mom, we've worked out a safety plan, So if things start getting out of control, I know what to do. I've got people to call. It's just so soon. Are you sure you don't feel pressured? Pressured to do what? To go back, return to active duty. I-I don't want you to do this Just to prove something to your father. I'm not. I need to get back to my unit. I want to. I'm gonna take care of myself, mom. Promise. How can you promise that? ♪ Wow. Good news travels fast, huh? So... No more pizza. I'll give my notice tomorrow. No, you'll give your notice tonight. Hey. Hi. Mm. Mm. ohh. What did I miss? About a beer and a half. Yeah. Wine? Please. Well, I think this occasion calls for a toast. There you go. Thank you. To the hump. You can't keep a good bar down. Yeah. Really, rox? Water? Yeah, water. It's better for the baby. What? Baby? I'm pregnant! Ohh! Why didn't you say anything? Oh, my gosh! That's so great. That's so great! I know! "dear mrs. Summerlin, "I know in many ways, "this letter will be a painful reminder for you, "but it is my sincere hope "that it might also bring a pa measure of comfort. Ou, "I didn't know your husband, But it is because of him that I can see." "how does a person say thank you For such a remarkable gift..." "especially a gift that came at such a high cost? "there are... "no words. "my only hope in writing "is to impress upon you my commitment "to living a life worthy of your husband's sacrifice, "a life focused on the things that truly matter... Duty to country..." "loyalty to friends... Love of family." "I will savor each day, "each moment, "and I will never forget just how fragile life is.
