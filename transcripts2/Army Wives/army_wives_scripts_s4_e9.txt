 Nothing. Just thought you'd be more settled in by now. Yeah. Well, you would think, But I kinda got a lot of stuff going on. But the kids' rooms are in great shape, If you haven't noticed. Okay, okay. Just asking. You taking up bodybuilding? Oh. Yeah, right. Um, no, I just want to make sure I pass the physical If the police department calls. Oh, still waiting to hear? Well, there's a hiring freeze, but I check in every week, You know, just in case. That's good. Listen, Chase, the kids need new gym shoes, And they're cheaper at the p.X.

Well, how about black and white? Frank. No, I'm serious. A nice, soothing color helps the baby's development. They've done studies. I know, and the latest research in early cognitive development Suggests that high contrast Actually stimulates the infant brain more. Hey, you're not the only one That can read up on a subject. You... you've been reading about babies? Well, when Jeremy was born, It was all just a-a blur, you know? At least it was for me. And, well, this time's gonna be different. Hmm. I'm proud of you. But I don't care if it's a boy or girl, There is no way we are painting The baby's room black and white. Just a thought. Oh. Hey. Kids still sleeping? Yeah. I love weekends. Ew, honey! What? We need a new car. Okay, how do we go from what we just did To "we need a new car"? I don't know. Good sex doesn't change the fact That I have to put oil in the car Every time I get gas. Okay. Come here. I got an idea. Why don't we talk about this later? Babe, the kids are gonna be up any minute. Fine. Besides, that was definitely the one. Oh, you think? Count on it. Right now there's a new little Leblanc in the making Right there. You've been saying that for months. I know. This Te I feel it. Well, I don't. I just don't understand what's wrong. You met with your ob-gyn this week. They said everything looked good, right? Yeah, but we're still waiting on some tests. You just gotta give it some time. I know. You're right. Someone's awfully chipper this morning. Just trying to get a head start on my next class. And you can't relax? It is the weekend, after all. Oh, look who's talking. Name a weekend in the past year When you haven't worked. Um... Yeah. Rest my case. This law school stuff's going straight to your head. I hope so. That's the plan. Hmm. 4 reps of 20. Congratulations. Did you hear that? Hmm? What? Sorry. New personal best on my knee flexes. Oh, honey, that's so great. Mm-hmm. Your mother's a little distracted by her studies. Oh, what else is new? Did you get that exam back yet? Mm. Grades are posted today. Mm. That explains it. What? Your mother's good mood. You nailed your first test, didn't you? Uh, yeah, sort of think I did. You're both setting the bar pretty high these days. I'm gonna have to elevate my game. You better. Are we out of soy milk? Mom? Exam results. Emmalin. Come on. You know you aced it. "b" minus over "c" plus? Well, maybe it's a mistake. No, that happens, mom. Teachers screw up sometimes. Maybe you got somebody else's grades. Hey. Morning. Trevor says that Chase Is bringing the kids over tomorrow. Well, that's nice. I gotta say, he's been really good with the kids. Yeah? Mm! Damn it! Bad tooth. It's fine. Can you give me a hand with this? Yeah, sure. Mm, mnh-mnh. Mnh-mnh. You should probably see a dentist. Yeah, well, I got no insurance Since I signed the divorce papers last month. So there's that. Nice timing, right? I wish I could give you a raise. Please, Rox. And, uh, Chase has been good with alimony? Yeah. Um... Yeah, he's... He's holding up his end. It's... it's... it's not that. It's, um, it's everything. It's first, last, security, It's the bills... It's the whole thing. Mm! Son of a bitch! Ohh. Okay. I'm calling the dentist. Ohh. That's it! Come to mama! Come on. Come on! Oh! That's my girl. Ohh! That's my girl. You still can't get enough of her, can you? Nope. You think I could tear you away from her for a day? I doubt it. Not even to go to Savannah tomorrow? Ride bikes, kayak... Ooh. Eat seafood overlooking the water. Patty's already lined up to babysit. Oh, baby, that's so sweet, but... No, but nothing. Look, if you want, we can drive back after dinner. Now the last time we tried something like that, We both got food poisoning. No oysters this time. I promise. I don't know. Look, the one thing we haven't done The whole time you've been home Is go on a romantic getaway together, Just the two of us. And we need it, Joan. All right. Savannah it is. Mm-hmm. Thank you. What are you looking at? Monkey! Open. Mm-hmm. A little wider. Aah! Ohh. Ah. Oh, yeah. Hmm. Well, it's a good thing you didn't wait any longer. Yeah? Yeah, you need a root canal, Ms. Moran. We need to clean out the nerve damage to your right molar And put in a crown. Well, how much is that gonna run me? Oh, ballpark, around $1,400. Your insurance should pay most of it. No. I lost my insurance last month. Divorce. Oh, I see. Mm. Well, check with Paula at the front desk. She can lay out a payment plan for you. Yeah? How does that work? Well, we need $600 up front to purchase the crown, But the balance can be financed over time. I don't have $600 right now. Is there, um, something temporary you could do instead? No. I don't want to alarm you, Ms. Moran, But there could be serious complications If you let this go untreated. The infection can spread, get into your bloodstream, Reach your heart, your brain... Okay, enough, enough. I'll, um... I'll... I'll get the money. Good. Good. Thank you for meeting with me, Professor. Of course. You wanted to talk about your exam? Yes. I, uh... I thought I'd done better. Well, "b" minus over "c" plus isn't a bad grade. I was balancing your writing with your case citations. I expect more from myself. Well, if it's any consolation, if you were arguing That exam problem before a court of law, I'd give you an "a" for presentation... Hmm. Well-reasoned, clearly stated... And very compelling. Hmm. okay. So I don't understand. You've been away from the classroom A long time, Ms. Holden. Meaning? Meaning the purpose of a legal education Is to learn how to explore all sides of an issue, To be able to argue Three or four opposing viewpoints at the same time. I gave you a fact pattern, And you only argued in one direction... The one you believed in. Hmm. Now I took a look at your law school application. It clear you do a significant amount of advocacy work Within the military. Yes, which is why I'm specializing In public interest law. Which I find admirable. I wish more students would follow your example. But ironically, I think your maturity and life experience Worked against you in this case. Because I expressed a personal point of view, I wasn't dispassionate. Correct. I'm surprised nobody in your study group Pointed out your lack of counter case arguments. I'm not in a study group. Really? Why not? I don't know. It, uh, never occurred to me, I guess. It's a big advantage to be in a group. I know one that's looking for a fourth. I'll have them e-mail you. Okay, great. You're doing fine, Mrs. Holden. I wouldn't be discouraged. Oh, I'm not. Thank you. Good. Your call is important to us. We will be with you momentarily. Mrs. Moran? Uh... yeah, I'm still here. My supervisor said we can't raise your credit. You're kidding. That's what he said. That's ridiculous. I'm sorry, ma'am. I'm only asking for a $1,000 increase on my limit. We still can't authorize it. But I've had this card for six years, And I've never missed a payment. Payment history isn't the only consideration When determining credit card ceilings. There are many factors involved. That's great. Is there anything else I can help you with? Okay, um... You know what? Never mind. Aw. Hey, Roland. Frank. Honey, look what Roland dropped off for the baby. Well, Santa came early this year. Oh, it's my pleasure. And if you guys have A little girl, we've got plenty of clothes. Uh, Denise, I know we're. This is short notice, But is there any chance You could babysit Sara Elizabeth tomorrow? Well, I have to be at the dispatch center at 3:00, But I-I can do it till then. That's great. Joan and I are going to Savannah for the day... Just a little romantic getaway. Aw. And Patty was all lined up to babysit, But she just called me with the flu. But you can do it till 3:00? Yeah. Um, what about emmalin? Emmalin's got plans. So does Claudia joy. And Roxy has work. Oh, hell, I can do it. I got nothing going tomorrow night. Hey, that's really nice, Frank, but, you know, Sara Elizabeth can be a real handful these days. Well, I admit it's been a while since I looked after a toddler, But I need to get back in training... and soon. Uh, honey, I don't think Roland wants his daughter To be used as a field exercise. Come on. That's not what I meant. Look, we'll tag team it. We'll take the first shift together. You show me the ropes. When you gotta leave, I'll take over. Roland? Um... U know, if the lieutenant colonel Can lead men into combat, I'm sure he can look after my daughter. Well, I appreciate that vote of confidence. I'll take these into the baby's room. Mm. Hey, thank you. Thank you, Frank. Well, what can I tell ya? My warrior has turned into Mr. Mom. What's the big deal? Weren't you in a study group at Harvard? Well, 20 years ago. So? I was a kid hanging out with other kids, Michael. Now I could be their mother... At least their den mother. You're all there to study. Age doesn't matter. Oh, yeah. Easy for you to say. Why are you so nervous about this? I don't know. I guess it's what Professor Kelling said. It's been a long time since I've been in the classroom. I just want to be able to hold my own. And you will. When do you meet 'em? Tomorrow. We're having coffee. Just be yourself, Claudia joy. If those brats can't appreciate what you bring to the party, They don't deserve you. Thank you. On the house... Room temperature so it won't hurt your tooth. Thanks. So what's happening on the baby front? Uh, nothing. I mean, plenty, but... It'll happen. ♪ What's this? A little advance. No. Pamela, take it. You need to pay the dentist. I did. What? Yeah, I go under the drill on Monday. Well, how did you come up with the money? My grandmother's brooch. No. Hey, you do what you gotta, right? I took it down to Truman's, and they gave me $800 for it. I'm really sorry. Nana was a practical woman. She would have said, "sell this damn rock and take care of business." So I did. ♪ It kinda sucked, but it's done. Yeah. I've been thinking... Rox, I might have to move back to Boston. What? Well, I got my family there, So I could probably live rent-free or close to it, Talk to some of my old connections And maybe get back on the force. Well, what about Chase? Well, obviously, we'd... You know, we'd have to work... I don't know, come to some kind of agreement. Like what? I don't know. Uh... I got all sorts of stuff flying through my head. I mean, look at my apartment. I don't even feel like I live there. I-I can't even bring myself to unpack. It's like I'm in this limbo. So I gotta work it out. ♪ All the food in the fridge is labeled. If she gets a little fussy, The banana bits usually do the trick. Well, that's good to know. It's all written down, Joan. And, uh, she's almost finished with her teething, But her back molars are still coming in, So if she's crying and you can't figure out why, Try the teething gel. It's right here. Right. Joan. Okay, uh, I think that's everything. Oh, did you see the contact numbers on the refrigerator? Yes. Okay, well, she'll be down for about another hour or so. Joan. Okay, thanks. Yes. Thank you. Have fun. Hey, and don't worry about a thing, okay? You make that an order, and maybe she'll listen to you. No, I can't. We're the same rank. Oh. All right, come on. See you later. Bye. Bye. Oh... wow. Wow is right. Whew. All right, dad. Should we go check on our little girl? Absolutely. Come on. Are you ready for one of these again? Well, I guess I have to be, huh? Mm. You're gonna do great. Darn it! Both hands, Finn. You gotta trap it like I showed you. I'm trying. It's okay, buddy practice makes perfect. Here you go, Luke. Good throw. Let's try it again. Hey. Nice catch, kae! Can we go get a drink? Yeah, let's take a break. Best behavior! That was fun. Yeah. All right. Let's see the heater. Yeah? You used to pitch, right? Okay. Whoa! Sorry, man. You asked for it. Guess so. So how's the new apartment working out? It's good. I mean, it's small, but the kids like it, I think. They're still getting used to things. Yeah, I bet. Situatns like this, There's always gonna be an adjustment period. Well, it's definitely different, but it's okay. I gotta admit, when I'm on a mission now, My mind's more clear. I don't have to worry so much About what's going on with Pamela. It may sound bad, but... no, no, no. I get it. You love your job. Right. And when I'm home now, I feel like I'm able to be there More for the kids than I used to be. I know it hasn't been easy for Pamela, But she seems to be doing okay. She seem that way to you? Yeah, I guess, I mean, with the exception Of that root canal, which can't be fun. Root canal? You didn't know? When did this happen? I don't know. Recently? Rox just told me. How's Pamela gonna pay for that? She doesn't have health insurance anymore. You know something? Oh. Why didn't we think about Doing something like this before? Oh, woman, for the past six months I've been telling you we needed to get away. Have you? Nice try. You know I have. Remember how we used to ride bikes together in Chicago? I sure do. That was good times. Yeah. That's what I'm talkin' about. It's back to basics. Here. Ooh. You've been working too hard, babe. Lot to do. Retraining for Afghanistan. No, I know. But the other day, I found a set of your a.C.U.S In Sara Elizabeth's closet. Really? Uh-huh. I didn't put 'em there. Well, I know I didn't put 'em there. Which leaves Sara Elizabeth, And frankly, I don't think she's that into camouflage. And last week, you put a quart of ice cream Back in the refrigerator instead of the freezer. You need to do a better job Of letting your husband take care of you. Now that... I can get used to. Mm. But in the meantime... Race you to the restaurant? Loser buys margaritas? Deal. All right. Hey. Hey! Hey, nothing. Okay. I better get going. All right, pretty girl. All right. Mm. Mm. Go on. Go. We're fine. It'll be time to eat in another 15 minutes. Roger that. D., it's under control. Okay? Okay. I'll see you back at the house. All right. Bye-bye, pretty girl. Okay. We're gonna have fun, huh? Why do we even need a fourth? I don't know about you, but I wouldn't mind sharing Some of the reading that's coming up. If she can pull her weight. Are you gonna finish that? Yeah, am. Hey, we've all heard her in class. She's smart. Yeah, she did get into Harvard law. Yeah, last century. Things were easier then. What is your problem? My problem is, I don't want to carry anybody. Look, it's obvious she's been doing all the reading on her own Up until this point... Mm-hmm. Unlike some people in this group. I say she's in. Me, too. Hmm. Okay. I know this is, uh, a little awkward. If the idea of having me in your group makes you uncomfortable, You can say it. I understand... No. No, no, no. Let's do it. Yeah. We'd love to have you. Great. Mark? I'm good with it. Sounds like the jury's still out. Okay. Let me conclude my closing argument By saying, I have a big house We can use for study sessions That comes equipped with a fully stocked refrigerator. I guess it's unanimous. Good. Thank you. All right, come on now. This is the last clean spoon. You throw this, and I'm gonna have to take time-out To clean 'em all. You don't want that, do you? How about that? Ah. She likes everything, don't you? Yeah. You gotta eat. No? How about some watermelon? Everybody loves watermelon. Here you go. Peas. Here. Gack? Come on. Hey. Try some bananas. Come on. Here. Sara Elizabeth... I don't know what to do for you, sweetheart. Um, how about a pickle? Want a pickle? I know you want to get down, but it's important that you eat. Okay, that's how you grow up To be big and strong, just like your mama. Hey. Hey, look, a funny clown. Ohh. Frank? Yeah, I'm sorry to disturb you, sir. What is that, a cat in heat? Uh, that would be your goddaughter, sir. Sara Elizabeth? Affirmative. I'm at the Burton residence. I got babysitting detail. Really? Yes, sir, and I have a bit of a situation here. Apparently. It's nothing I can't handle, but I thought that perhaps Considering your background with the child And the fact that you've raised two females yourself That perhaps... Sit tight. I'm on my way. Thank you, sir. Ohh. Thank you for coming, sir. Of course. Sorry. Yeah. Well, let's see what we got. Okay. We're going in. ♪ Here. For your two-top. Rox, I said draft. Ohh. Hey, what about our beers? They're coming. Just hold on. Guys must be thirsty. Yeah, I guess. Okay, here. Oh, thanks. Okay. ♪ Aah. Excuse me. Okay. Here you go. You're welcome. Where's our gumbo, honey? Just give me a sec. Hey, I'm still waiting on that gumbo. Yeah, it's gonna be two minutes. Chief's buried back there. Okay. You guys a little short tonight? Yeah. A waitress called in sick. Maybe I could help. Sure, I'll grab you an apron. No, I meant after your shift. Uh, thanks, but I'll pass. You got a boyfriend? No, what I got are, uh, two kids and a root canal. So thanks but no, thanks. Excuse me. Could we get some drinks over here? Coming. ♪ Now according to colonel Burton's instructions, She should be asleep by now. She's overstimulated. Sir? That happened to my girls all the time. They'd work themselves into a state, And then they just couldn't calm down. Ah-ah! Well, what did you do about it? As I recall, and it's been a while, The only foolproof method was to put 'em in a car And drive 'em around for a few blocks. And that worked? The only foolproof method out like a light. N a car Well, Roland said there's a car seat in the hall closet In case of emergencies. I'd say this qualifies. And how long did it usually take to calm 'em down? Five or six bloc Max. It's been 20 minutes. A few more blocks. Roger that. Options, sir? I'm out. What'd you use to do when Jeremy got like this? Call Denise. Oh, Roger that. What would she do? Well, the only thing I can remember soothing the boy Was her singing. Singing?
