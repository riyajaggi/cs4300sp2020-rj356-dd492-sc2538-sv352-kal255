 I won't let you down. We're going with a princess theme for her party, And my wife's got her heart set on a castle cake. We can do that. I'm sorry to make such a big deal out of this, But my wife's gonna join the party by video chat, And I want everything to be perfect for her. Well, I'm glad you told me. Before it was gonna be good. Now it's gonna be perfect. Check out this cake. Special order from the commissary. A friend of ours bought a custom cake here the other day and... and he dropped it. Yeah. It was a total disaster. So we need another one. She's out of luck. Don't get your panties in a bunch, Irma. There's gotta be something we could do. You're an angel, Marisol. Hey, we army wives gotta stick together, right? You bet!

Come in. Sir, did someone call 9-1-1? Yeah, I did. My wife fell. Marisol. well, we're still assessing. Hi. Hey. Just finished my shift. I thought I'd come check on you. How you doing? Good, thanks. Embarrassed. mm-hmm. Gotta learn to watch where I'm going. How's your head? Oh, a few stitches. Yeah. Yeah, my hair will cover it, thank God. Hey, listen. Um... If you're having problems at home, There are people on post that you can talk to. I can... Thanks. But the only problem I have at home is closet space. Too many shoes. I told you, I-I just fell down, that's all. Hey, baby. Pete. Mmm. You remember the paramedic that took care of me. Sure. She came to check in on me. Isn't that nice? Yeah. I told her I was fine... Hey. And I'm just a klutz. You ready? I pulled the car up. Uh-huh. Uh, you sure you don't want a wheelchair? No, no, no. I've got her. I've got her. Oh, whoop... easy does it. Easy does it. Take care. I'll make sure she does. Good morning, Charleston. This is Johnny b. With your wake-up call. Hey, don't forget to come out To our big u.S.O. Show this week, Featuring five for fighting and Wynonna Judd. Here's a little something to get your heart started. ♪ Give me a sign, all right ♪ ♪ hey, little baby, give me a sign ♪ ♪ give me a sign tonight ♪ ♪ you may not find anything ♪ ♪ about me that you like ♪ ♪ hey, little, baby, if you give me a sign ♪ Oh, my God. ♪ On and on ♪ Please stop, seriously. Oh, honey. Married people are allowed to have fun, too. Yeah, you're not married people. You're my parents. Hey, we're just trying to get in the spirit of things. Your mother spent a lot of time planning this concert For Winona and those five for fighting guys. Dad, it's Wynonna. And five for fighting is really one guy... john Ondrasik. I knew that. Yeah. Please promise you're not going to embarrass me tomorrow night. Embarrass? Me? It's gonna be off the hook! Let's see what you got. Dad. Uh... Mom, save me! Oh! One, two, three, one, two, three. This is so not happening. Mmm, is that coffee I smell? Good morning. Good morning. Ahh. You worked late. Mm-hmm. Mmm. Hey, can I ask you a hypothetical? Yeah. Fire away. What would you do If you thought a soldier was abusing his wife? What's this about? It's just a hypothetical. You're okay? No, I'm fine. I-I promise. Just looking for information. All right. First off, why do I suspect abuse? The wife has injuries consistent with assault. But she hasn't made a complaint? Mnh-mnh. Why not? Fear, shame, guilt, uh... These things are complicated, Frank. You know that. I do. And presently... I mean, officially... I don't see how much the army can do. Oh, I know it's frustrating, but it's a... It's a he said/she said kind of thing. She wants help, she's gotta talk to someone, file a complaint, Get her injuries documented. Look, no woman should ever have to go through Something like that. So you let me know if there's anything I can do, okay? I will, yeah. All right. Have a good day. You, too. Marisol? The girl from the commissary? You sure he hit her? She had a split lip and a cut on the back of her head. How do you get that falling down? You don't. Yeah, and my coworker made a call to her house last month. Same situation. Ugh. Well, what more do you need? I'm just trying to figure out what to do about it. Well, it's not about you. It's about her. She needs to make up her mind to walk away. It's what I did with my ex. One punch to the gut when I was pregnant... That's all it took. I was outta there. You know, if you hadn't walked in on Jeremy hitting me, I don't know that I ever would've admitted I had a problem. It's a lot to face up to. Well, you're a real friend. Maybe that's what Marisol needs. Does she have any friends on post, any family nearby? No. She and her husband were p. C.S.'ed here three months ago. I don't know if she knows a soul. Well, that's not exactly true. It's worth a shot. You're right. Hi. They told me you were out here. How's the lip? What do you want? I'm worried about you. There's nothing to be worried about. I don't think that's true. I can see that it's not true. I put together some information for you. Um... The army has classes. My husband's a good man. I'm not questioning that. Yes, you are. You want to get him in trouble. No, I want him to get help. But right now, I'm more concerned about you 'cause you're the victim here, Marisol. You are the one being hurt. You don't know what you're talking about. Yes, I do. My son... Used to hit me. And he's a good person, too. He was angry and confused. God, he needed help, and I didn't know what to do. So I just... I just let it keep happening over and over Till a friend found out, and she made me face the truth. He's better now, But I could've saved us both so much If I had just spoken up sooner. You're new here. I thought maybe you could use a friend. Just take it, please? The army can help, but you have to ask for it. The army cannot help. What do you mean? I have work. Look, Marisol, I don't know what experience You've had on other posts... look, you don't know Pete. You don't know me. You don't know anything. I know what a beating looks like. Stay away from me! Afternoon, sergeant. At ease. Mind if I join you? Have a seat, ma'am. So I understand congratulations are in order. Yes, ma'am. Uh, my wife had our second child last week... A little girl. That is wonderful. What's her name? Margaret. It was- it was my mother's name. Hard to be away at times like this. Gotta embrace the suck, ma'am. I notice you eating alone lately, Staying in quarters more than usual. Is there something I should be concerned about? No, ma'am. Mind on the mission. You know, I have a daughter myself. Sara Elizabeth. She just turned 1. My biggest fear is that, When I get home, she won't remember who I am. Ma'am... My biggest fear is, I don't remember them now. I mean, I have photos. I have video. But when I'm on patrol, In my head, I can't see them. I can't remember what they sound like. I understand, but I don't want you going off by yourself. It's not good to bottle things up. I'm a sergeant, ma'am. I lead by example. I c... Exactly. That doesn't mean shutting down emotionally. You've got to keep your head in the game, And you can't do that If you're not dealing with your own problems. Trust me, sergeant. You're not fooling your soldiers. Look, You're one of my best young leaders. If you've got a problem, Talk to sergeant Larson, talk to me. That's why we're here. We gotta stick together. Yes, ma'am. Thank you, ma'am. Carry on. Oh, and, uh... How come I didn't get one of those cigars You were passing out last week? I'll make a note of it, ma'am. You do that. I came on too strong, and she shut me down. Look, it's hard to help someone Who doesn't want to be helped. What was I thinking? Why would she listen to me? Denise, you saw a woman in trouble, And you tried to help. It was the right thing to do. Yeah, maybe, but now I won't be able to get anywhere near her. Okay, so what do we do? Well, she still has to take the first step And admit that she has a problem. Maybe I could talk to Michael, See if he can open an investigation. Based on what evidence? Yeah, that was Frank's point. It's a delicate situation, Claudia joy. I mean, if this guy is on a hair trigger, And we act prematurely, We could actually make things a lot worse. And she doesn't trust the army. I got the impression she tried that route before And something went wrong. Well, I wish I could talk to her. It's hard to stand by while a wife here at fort Marshall Is being beaten. Maybe you could use f. R.G. To contact her. Yeah. I know exactly how she feels. I didn't want Jeremy to get in trouble, either. It's so hard when you're hurt by someone you love. I even kept it from you. We'll find a way to help her. Promise. Tell me something good. Why? What's going on? Oh, the usual. Today, I had to buck up one of my best sergeants. His wife had a baby this week. Hard to handle from 6, 000 miles away. I really get that. Well, how's the school coming? Slowly. The work you're doing- it's important, Joan. You're gonna change the lives of a lot of children. Well, that's the plan. So what's going on there? Uh, well, Sara Elizabeth's Really enjoying her Spanish lessons. She's got her multiplication tables down, But her long division Could use some work. Roland. I was just kidding. Everything's good. Uh, big buzz on post is A u.S.O. Show. Aw! I'm jealous. You know, we were supposed to get a show last week, But a sandstorm grounded all flights. My guys could really use the lift. Well, if I could, I would send Wynonna and five for fighting over To play just for you, my dear. Maybe you can. What are you talking about, Joan? So you wanna broadcast the u. S.O. Show to your unit? What do you think? It's brilliant. I only wish we thought of it earlier. The concert's tomorrow night. I can make it happen on this end. Can you make it on yours? Well... I know a few of the a/v guys from the radio station, But I don't know how much pull I have anymore. Don't forget, I got fired for being a little opinionated. That's exactly what I need, Pamela... Someone strong enough to push this through. You are the perfect person to get this done. Will you try? Well, when you put it like that... Attagirl. I'll check in tomorrow. Night, Joan. Whew, she's good. Yeah. She is. Something smells good. Chicken and rice. Mmm. Mmm, my favorite. For you. Pete. I'm sorry about the other night, baby. You know how much I love you, yeah? I love you, too. Mmm. The flowers don't make it all okay. I know. I know. I messed up. Mm. I was thinking... Uh, I heard about these classes on post for people like us. I mean, maybe we could change. Maybe... maybe we can be better. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Where the hell did this come from? You been talking to someone? No, Pete. Someone sees us taking a class, what are they gonna think? You know how rumors fly. Crap like that can destroy a career, But you didn't think about that, did you? Did you think about that? Look at me! You didn't think about that, did you? I get kicked out of the army, where does that leave you, huh? I pay for this house! I pay for this food! Come here. Come here. No, no, no! No! No! Aah! Oh! No! No, Pete! Pete, Pete, no! Oh, my God. Marisol. Help me. I just wanted him to get help. Do you have any idea how brave you are, Marisol, Coming to my house? Took real courage. I had to wait until he was gone. It's okay. Sergeant Evans is In Charlie company, second battalion. That's right. All right. Keep me updated. Thanks, Frank. Frank's gonna talk to Evans' C.O. Will he get a military protection order? From what I've seen, I don't think that'll be a problem. Good. I don't want him anywhere near her. If sergeant Evans did this, I want that man behind bars and out of the army. Have you talked to Mrs. Evans about pressing charges? Not yet. Uh, she's too overwhelmed right now. It took everything she had just to leave him. We need to give her a little time. Not too much time. I can't hold sergeant Evans indefinitely. I know. As many times as we've seen this, it doesn't get easier. No. Love you. Mm-hmm. I'm sorry, Pamela. You know I would if I could. I'm short the manpower. I got a crew on their way to fort Jackson Covering a change of command, Another at Stewart recording field exercises. I got another at Bragg, en route... well, it's just for one night. I know. But it's tonight. We wouldn't ask if it wasn't important. Yeah, I'm sorry. It's just not possible. I got a question, George. You mind if I call you "George"? You going to the concert? Me and the wife. So you like Wynonna? "like" doesn't even cover it. How'd you like to meet her? Left. Left. (manall chutes ready to go by 2300. (manall chutes ready to go by 2300. That means today. Staff sergeant Cole? Detail, attention! As you were. Can I get a minute? Yes, sir. So you're sergeant Evans' squad leader. Yes, sir. What can you tell me about him? Pete's a stud, sir. Honor graduate of the warrior leader course, N.C.O. Of the month. The men love him. You know his wife? We've met. You aware of any problems at home? Simple question, sergeant. Well, she came to see me once, Back at fort Riley. Said that Pete was having a... Little anger problem. That's how she put it? "little anger problem"? She said he hit her, sir. I didn't see that in his file, sergeant. No, sir. I spoke to Pete right away. He was real busted up about it. Said it was a onetime thing. We'd just finished our tour, And a lot of the men were having a hard time readjusting. I see, I see. So you thought you'd handle it man-to-man? Did you contact your platoon leader? No, sir. And you didn't conduct a home visit To ensure Mrs. Evans' safety? No, sir. You think it's okay to hit women, staff sergeant? No, sir! 'cause it sure looks like it to me. Mrs. Evans never came back to see me, sir. Why would she? You didn't do a damn thing to help her! Where is sergeant Evans right now? Live fire exercise. Well, I am placing him under an m.P.O. You go find him, immediately escort him to barracks. He does not go home, he does not leave this post. Do you understand? Yes, sir. And when that's done, report to my office. Yes, sir. You're dismissed. Your husband's being confined to barracks for 72 hours. It's, uh, it's called a military protective order. What does that mean? It's like a restraining order. He can't come near you. My husband talked to Pete's squad leader. Apparently, you went to see him When you were stationed at fort Riley? Staff sergeant Cole. But... He didn't do anything. The army let you down, Marisol. I'm sorry. But that's over now. You will get all the support you need here. I was 16 When I met Pete. My cousin Emilio had basic with him, Brought him home on leave. Pete was... Handsome... And... funny and... Loving. He made me feel like I was his whole world. He always had a temper. But he never laid a hand on me until after his first tour. The wives I knew at fort Riley... They told me it was the war that changed him. I had to be patient... Understanding. But it just... Kept getting worse. The war is no excuse For what your husband's been doing to you. I tried to be a good wife. I tried to understand. None of this is your fault, Marisol. I still love him. That doesn't mean you should let him hurt you. What happens next? That's up to you. They can only hold him for three days Without a formal investigation. I want to press charges. Hey, Pamela. We've got a problem. Come on. That tiny wire Is what's holding up the video link? This tiny piece of wire is an antique. We're talking commodore 64 era. You know what I'm saying? No. But we do have a unit in Iraq expecting to see A u.S.O. Concert in just a few hours. Roger that. But to make this happen, I have to pull all this aluminum line, secure 2 t1s, Drop 5 ports and run cat 6 cabling. Hey, tell me something, specialist. You like Wynonna? I love her. Ahh. How'd you like to meet her? Go back there and see what it looks like. Look, what you're asking for, I-it's impossible. I-I'd need two more techs, And I'm only budgeted for a one-man job. Look... We're talking about soldiers Doing their third or fourth tour here. You know what that's like. They deserve a friggin' break. And right now, you're the only guy That can make that happen. Let me make a few calls. That's what I'm talking about. Thank you, specialist. Please contact the sergeant major's office. Thank you. I hate hospitals. Just try to relax. Uh-huh. Mm. The doctor will give you a complete exam So we can document The full extent of your injuries. And then, um, you'll meet with a member Of the family advocacy program... Who'll take a statement. You're gonna do great. You'll stay with me? Of course. Pete! How'd you get out of the barracks? Baby, when I heard what was going on, I had to see you. I love you so much. You know that, right? You know how sorry I am, Ba... Baby, I never meant to hurt you. You really need to leave. Look, I love this woman. She's my life. And this is none of your business. I don't know what people have been telling you, baby, But you can't listen to them. You can't. They don't know you the way I do. They don't know us, What we've been through together. Baby, you're my whole world. We can make this right together. Marisol, don't listen to him. I told you to stay out of it! Excuse me. I wonder if you could help me. I'm looking for a patient... Marisol Evans. Yes, ma'am. Room 218. Wow. You memorize every patient's room number? No, ma'am. I only remember Because her husband asked for it five minutes ago. Her husband? What do you say? Let me take you home. We can start over. No. You'll ruin everything. You stupid bitch! Aah! Okay, we really need to calm-no! You owe me. I give you everything, and this is how you repay me?! You are nothing without me! Nothing! You need me, Marisol. Now come on! I am not nothing! What'd you say? What? Military police. Sergeant Peter Evans, you're under arrest For violating a military protective order. Look what you're doing to us. Look what you're doing to us! You're nothing! Move it! You're worthless, you hear me?! You're worthless! He walked right out of the barracks. Just signed himself out. Who knows what damage he could've done? Thank God he didn't. Only because you were at the hospital. Hmm. It's inexcusable. I'm gonna find out who's responsible, And heads are gonna roll. Michael, calm down. It's over now. No, the procedures and the policies are in place. This should've never happened. And I know you'll take steps to make sure it doesn't again. You know, we need to find A better way to reach the victims, too, Make them feel safer about coming forward. I think I'll talk to family advocacy in the morning. I'd like to go with you. Yeah? Thank you. Emmalin, let's go. Coming! I think that's everything. Well, whatever you don't have you can borrow from me. I really appreciate you putting me up tonight. Of course. Hey, it's gonna be all right. Everything's just... Changing so fast. My husband's in jail. My marriage is over. Oh, my God. Where do I go? What do I do? Shh. You can't think about all that at once. Yeah. You gotta take it one step at a time. When I left my husband, I was six months pregnant, $32 to my name, No job, no place to live. I spent the first night in the backseat of my car, Just crying my eyes out. What did you do? Well, I had a friend who let me stay with her, And, uh, I spent the next week curled up on her couch, Just wondering how the hell I'd let it get that far. And then I realized that That wasn't gonna make anything any better. So I got my butt up, And I found a job And got a place to live. And I moved on. That's what you have to look forward to. I'm scared. Yeah. I get that. But being scared for the future Is a hell of a lot better than being scared for your life. You okay? I don't want to be alone. You're not alone. In fact, we were thinkin'... There's this u.S.O. Concert tonight... Maybe you could come with us. I don't think so. If you don't, you're just gonna think about everything, And that will make you nuts. So just come for a little while, see how you feel. We'll leave the minute you want to go. Uh... I look terrible. I mean... I can help with that. She can. So what do you think? Come on, let's do it. Yes. Okay. Here. Okay, so I just got off the phone with Kowicki. We are good to go on this end. Outstanding! My team's expecting a mandatory training video, Which they hate. Perfect. I owe you big-time, Pamela. Listen, you just come home safe. Looking after your kid is easy, But looking after your husband is a full-time job. I'll keep that in mind. Good luck tonight. Yeah, to both of us. Whew. It's an honor to meet you both. Thank you. It is a privilege to be here. Oh! You know, every army command has its own coin, And the 23rd is no exception. And it is a tradition to hand it out For service above and beyond the call of duty. I want to thank you both for coming. Thank you. It's an honor, sir. Now if you'd excuse me, I need to go warm up with the boys. Don't want to disappoint our troops. Well, you knock 'em dead.
