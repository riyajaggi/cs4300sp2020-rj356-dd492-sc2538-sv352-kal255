 I'll take it, no strings. I'm having these nightmares about Michael, About him being hurt. I feel like I... Might never see my husband again. Michael? What's happened to my husband? We have a situation. What do you mean, "a situation"? Tell me he's not dead. He's missing. General holden was on a mission to meet with tribal elders... I know. I talked to him. A sandstorm blew in.

 And went down hard. It crashed? When ground troops reached the crash site, The pilot and another crew member were dead. There was no one else in sight. How can that be? We think the survivors were taken hostage. Several of the villages in the area Are sympathetic to the Taliban. I need to talk to someone, someone on the ground. Camp eagle is under a communications blackout. I don't care! Joan! Honey, honey, you're upset. You're not thinking clearly. Okay? Let's go inside and we'll sit down. Okay? Okay. Okay. Um... Okay, what else? News like this tends to get out, So treat any media reports with skepticism. If there is anything important and substantiated, I will contact you. Okay. Thank you. I'm sorry. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. No, sir. The sand has kicked up again. Now they're telling me I can't put up any birds For at least another four hours. Yes, sir. I understand that. But at least with this weather, We know they couldn't have gotten very far. I mean, ground traffic's down to zero as well. Yes, sir. Those additional assets are still arriving. I'll have more for you in an hour at the briefing. Yes, sir. Will do, sir. Thank you. I-I should've told him. What? Remember before deployment, I told you, I felt something was gonna happen to Michael, And I-I should've said something. I should've... Oh, God. I should've warned him somehow. They were just dreams, Claudia joy. They were pretty real dreams, Denise. I understand, honey. But you know it doesn't matter if you told Michael or not. He would've gone anyway. Hey, mom! Oh, God. I got my cap and gown for graduation. What? it's never gonna end, is it? What isn't? This... The anxiety attacks... The flashbacks. Hey. Let's see if we can't get back to Afghanistan. That's the root of the problem. You up for giving it one more shot? I can't. Dan, let's just try. Okay? Just take a few deep breaths. Just concentrate on your breathing. Close your eyes. You're in the Kunar province... Dug in with your platoon. Walker's standing watch. Dan? Dan, you're still in my office. You're safe. My chest. I... Can't breathe. It'll pass. You know that. Just... Just relax. No. No. No. Okay. Okay, hey, Dan, open your eyes. Open your eyes. Everything's okay. We don't have to talk about this anymore today. It's okay. Sorry. Finn, what is this? What? I found this in your lunch box. It says that you have a science project due next Monday. I told you. Nice try, but this is the first I've heard of it. You put it on the calendar. Sorry. Hey, how about that papier-mâché volcano? That was last year. Yeah, so? We interrupt this program To bring you a special news report. An army helicopter Carrying soldiers of the 2n Has crashed in Afghanistan. The army has yet to make an official statement, But we have unconfirmed reports that a high-ranking general May have been aboard. Oh, no. My sources also indicate at least two fatalities, But the army is remaining tight-lipped As rescue and retrieval efforts are ongoing at this time. Hey, Rox. Have you seen the news? No, still at work. What's up? Dr. Burton, we've got three new referrals from Mercer And nowhere to put them. Dr. Burton? I'm sorry. Just thinking about Dan Malone. No progress? It's like pushing a rock up a hill, Patty. Every time we start to make, He has another panic attack. Ah. Excuse me. Mm. Right. Hey, Joan. Roland, there's something you should know. It's about general holden. The army continues to offer no comment On the reported crash, But reporters who are familiar with the 23rd Say that a second escort helicopter Had turned back prior to the crash With mechanical difficulties of its own. Nothing new. You should eat something, Claudia joy. Keep your strength up. Yeah, Roland's right. You need to eat. I'm not hungry. When was the last time you checked your levels? Denise. She hasn't, not since I've been home. I'll get your Kit. I really appreciate you all being here, But you should go home. Your families need you also. The kids are all staying at the Sullivans' tonight, So they're fine. Yeah, pizza and movies on a school night... They're more than fine. Oh! There's another report. Weather and treacherous mountains Continue to hinder search efforts. I'm told, in that treacherous terrain, It could take quite a while To locate the general and his team... Claudia joy, why don't we Rn that off for a little while? Joan will update us if there's anything important. I need to hear this. Collaborators could be holding the downed soldiers While awaiting instructions from Taliban leadership. Naturally, it would be quite a coup for the Taliban To capture a United States army general. Hey. Hey. I wasn't sure if I should come over or not, But... Here. What's this? It's Pralis from Blanche's, your favorite. Pretty lame, right? I didn't know what else to do. Emmalin, your dad's gonna be okay. How can you be so sure? Okay, I mean, I-I can't be sure, But you have to stay positive, right? Why? Why should I stay positive? I already lost a sister for no reason, And now this. What am... What am I gonna do without my dad? I'm awake. How you doing? Last time dad deployed, I was just a kid. I didn't really understand how it was. It's harder now, knowing. How are you doing? It's hard for me, too. We're gonna get through this. We will. Okay? Mom, can you stay a while? Of course, baby. Of course. Okay. No group has claimed responsibility For the missing soldiers, But it appears from our accounts That military authorities are treating this As a hostage situation. Government spokesmen will only confirm That a Blackhawk helicopter did go down in... Hey. You going somewhere? Condolence visit. I need to see the wives Of the two soldiers killed in Michael's helicopter crash. You sure you're ready for that right now? It's my responsibility to look after the spouses. I know, but... Emmalin is with Zach for a few hours. I have the time. Claudia joy... Denise, I have to go. Michael would want me to. He'd expect it. You want some company? The kids don't know yet. They're on a camping trip with my sister's family. I decided not to tell them till they get back. Let them be happy for as long as they can. I'm so sorry, Carrie. We're here for you, whatever you need. What I need... What I need... I need my husband back. I need my children to have a father. I used to look at the other wives, The ones who lost their husbands... And I'd think how Noble they were, Sacrificing for the greater good. But there is nothing Noble about this, And I don't give a damn about the greater good. My husband is dead. He's never coming back. Oh, God. I'm sorry. I don't know how to do this. Claudia joy... I don't kn how to do this! Okay. Just help me clean up, all right? Okay. Shh. Okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Denise. No, it's okay. Shh. Just help me clean up. No, no, no, no. Glass. Okay. That's it, boy. Nice job, Finn. Now take that sample and rub it in the second dish. Perfect. These petri dishes contain a growth medium. Agar. That's correct. How'd you know that? I don't know. Okay, now you keep these covered, And soon, you'll be able to see Which saliva sample grows the most bacteria. Gs or humans. Exactly. This is the best science project ever. Okay, kiddo. Go do the rest of your homework. Thanks, Dr. Burton. You're welcome, Finn. Thank you so much. I didn't know who else to call. Trevor usually helps with the science projects. I'm happy to help. Besides, it takes my mind off of work. Yeah, tell me about it. With Trevor deployed and taking care of the kids And keeping things going at the hump, A-and now this situation With general holden and Claudia joy... It just makes you think, you know? Everything can change in an instant. I just wish I could talk to Trevor. Yeah. You silly mutt. Yes, you are. Yes, you're a good boy, aren't you? I know, I know. Hey, Rox. Could I ask you for a favor? Yeah. Name it. Damn it. Hey. Easy there, cowboy. Why don't you just go to the desk And get your money back? Or you could do that. Yes! Listen, is something bothering you? Uh, no. 'cause if I've said or done anything... What are you doing? Apologizing. Why? I don't know. I thought maybe 'cause of all the crap The guys are saying about the murder... you think I give a damn what those guys say? You did a great job on that case. You deserve all the credit you're getting. Okay. So why the silent treatment? What? This is me you're talking to, Boone, Or not talking to. You think I don't know by now when you're pissed? Either talk to me or get over it. I'm mad at myself. And I'm taking it out on you. Mad about what? I thought that murder case was above our pay grade. I would've dropped the whole thing. I've become complacent. You are not complacent. You're content. There's a big difference. Yeah, well... Watching you made me think. Do me a favor, would you? Get me a new battery. I have a whole mess of paperwork to do. Sure. Hell of a cop, Moran. Is there anything I can tell Mrs. Holden? I promised to keep her informed, But the media seems to know more than I do. Don't I know that. Look, Joan, I can tell you what I know, But we gotta keep a lid on it. Understood. All right, CIA... Picked up a cell phone call Confirming three hostages from a helicopter crash, Which is damn good news, 'cause at least we know they're still alive. But we have indications they're moving eastward. Eastward? To Pakistan. Affirmative. If they make it across that border, Our job gets a hell of a lot harder. You all right? Chase. Let's go home, general. Please keep that completely dry For the next 24 hours, general. Will do. The orthopedist should be here any minute, sir, To look at your leg, sir. Thank you. How are they doing? They're good. Good. Docs say they should be just fine. Good. I spoke to colonel Burton. Claudia joy and emmalin are well, Looking forward to your call. Thank you, Frank. You did an outstanding job. Even when things looked pretty bleak out there, I knew you'd find us. Well, if I may say so, general, Next time you want to get away from the flagpole And I suggest you take more escort, Please take more escort. Roger that. Hey. How'd it go back there? How's general holden? He should be fine. Great. I'll have to call my mom Once the blackout's lifted. She and the general's wife are best friends. Hey. What's up? Something's wrong. They changed my orders. I'm leaving tomorrow. What? It's supposed to be two weeks. That's the army. There's nothing we can do about it. I don't believe it. Can you come by tonight, say good-bye? I g... I got guard duty. I... You can't get out of it? Guess this is it, then. Just like that? You got any other ideas? We both knew this couldn't last. I can't believe this is so easy for you. Easy? You think this is easy for me? Tanya... I guess you don't know me so well after all. Gabriel... forget it. I knew this whole thing was a mistake. This is lucky. Yours? A friend's. You can pet him if you like. He's a war vet, too. Iraq. Saved a couple of soldiers. Oh, you're kidding. Nah, that's why they call him "lucky." Hey, you're a good boy, aren't you, lucky? Hey, Dan, would you mind If lucky sat on the couch beside you? Nah. It's your couch. Come on, boy. Looks like you got a new friend. Okay, so let's talk about that morning In Kunar province. I just want you to go over what happened As calmly and clearly as you can. 0611... Walker's standing watch. Right. Um... I was gonna relieve him When the first r.P.G. Round hit. Then they opened fire from everywhere. Zelnick got hit in the neck. Harris and Kreslof... An r.P.G. Round hit... Just as they reached their humvee. The blast took off Harris' right foot. Kreslof was gone. Cummings and I, uh, Pulled Harris outta there. We set a tourniquet in place for him. Hey. Hey. Hey... Gina Maddox. What's up with Atlanta p.D.'s finest? What? You're kidding. Hey. Hey. So you're not gonna believe what just happened? What? Well, you know that Detective that I worked with from Atlanta? Yeah. Well, her department's forming a new unit, And she talked to her bosses about me, And they're interested. Interested in what? They want me to come in for an interview. In Atlanta? Yeah, well, that's... that's where the job is. But it's crazy, right? Is that what you told her? No. Um... No, not exactly. I told her that I would think about it. But there's no way I could do it, right? I mean, I've got the... Kids to think about, And Chase is here, And, of course, there's, you know, all you guys, I mean, my whole support system's here. Right. What do you think? I think you're right. But I've been thinking, We've all been lucky for a really long time. What do you mean? Well, I-I mean all of us. This is the army. You know, sooner or later, Everybody's gonna have to go somewhere else. Claudia joy, Denise, Roland, you, Chase... You know, we're not gonna be at fort Marshall forever. Yeah, I try not to think about it. Me, too. But then something like this comes along... Yeah. Look... It kills me to say this, 'cause... I don't want you to go. I... I don't know what I would do without you. But... I know what you would tell me. What's that? You have to do what's best for you. Yeah. Yeah. It was amazing, Joan. That dog did more in one day than I've been able to do In a whole month. Well, can you keep borrowing lucky? I don't have to. I already put in an application for a service dog. Dan is a perfect candidate to get one. Aw. Congratulations. Thank you. I've got good news. Hmm? My medical team just lifted all restrictions on my activities. So you're full active duty again? Yeah. Wow. Does that mean you'll be deploying? If that's what the army wants. Right. Well, it looks like we both have something to celebrate. We certainly do. Hey, beautiful. Aw. You have no idea how good it is to see you. That communications blackout was killing me. Yeah, me, too. So what's been going on? Uh, well, let's see. Um, Finn is studying spit, And our dog is now a doctor. Come on. I'm serious. So am I. Uh, t.J. Got a b-plus on his math test. And, um... Pamela might be moving to Atlanta. What? Yeah. She might have gotten a job at the Atlanta p.D. That must be tough, huh? Tough? Try... Impossible. Honey, besides you and the boys, Pamela's the closest thing to family I've had In my entire life. Well, maybe she won't get the job. I'm not wishing for that. I just... Babe, talk to me. Nothing. Rox. You know, It's bad enough that you're gone. What if Pamela leaves, too? If Pamela... If Pamela goes... You're a graduate. You just need... Emmalin, any last words as a High School senior? Turn the camera off, Zach. Mom, a little help here, please. Oh, I am with Zach on this one. We don't want your father to miss a minute of it. Come on. Smile. Be pretty. Okay, dad. This is for you. Boy, I must really love you. Yes. Are you smiling?
