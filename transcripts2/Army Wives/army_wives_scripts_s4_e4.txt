So what went on last night That was "totally unbelievable"? Oh, you heard that. Uh-huh. It wouldn't have anything to do with boys, would it? Uh, like you didn't look at boys when you were in college.

Okay, well, here you are. Uh, mom? Hmm? Do me a favor. Mm. Don't come in. I wasn't planning to. You're the best. Mm, have fun. I'll meet you after. Good luck. Mm-hmm. Thanks. ♪ ... To the good life ♪ ♪ to get away on this perfect day ♪ A minivan? Seriously? What are ya, a soccer mom? This coming from a man who rides a scooter. I told you, leblanc, it's a fully stripped street bike. 450 cc's. And I told you, my mustang's on its last leg. I'm gonna need new wheels any day now. Hey, sergeant. Martinez. Looking sharp. What's up, soldier? Wanted you to know, I deploy next week-afghanistan. I'm really proud of you. No way I could've done it without you, sergeant. Come here. I want you to meet a buddy of mine. Sergeant farina, private martinez. He deploys next week. Heard a lot about you, private. Really? Oh, yeah. Sergeant leblanc here's bragging about you all the time. You're a great success story here at the station. Hey, I got an idea. I'm going to your old high school today. Do you want to come with me, Outstanding. How old's your daughter? She turns 1 this week. Beautiful. Thank you. We're going with a princess theme for her party, And my wife's got her heart set on a castle cake. We can do that. Okay. It's, um... Two layers, uh, pink frosting, a moat And a gumdrop drawbridge. Gumdrops. That's all you do is crumple and give - for me? Thank you. And how do you want the layers? Um... Uh... Pink frosting. I got that part. I meant the cake. Yellow cake? White cake? Chocolate? Marble? Why don't you call your wife? I can wait. She's in iraq. Ah. Um... Suggestion? One layer yellow, one layer of chocolate. Everybody's happy. That's great. I'm sorry to make such a big deal out of this, But my wife's gonna join the party by video chat, And I want everything to be perfect for her. Well, I'm glad you told me. Before, it was gonna be good. Now it's gonna be perfect. thank you. Whatever questions you have, I'm here to answer them. And you're sure this is confidential, right? My husband isn't gonna find out that I was here? No. Whatever we talk about stays strictly between you and me. That doesn't mean I'm getting a divorce. Of course. Why don't we just dive in? How long have you been married? Uh, 13 years. 2 kids, 11 and 10. I guess my first question is the house. My husband gets it, right? No. Sorry. Both you and sergeant moran would have to move off post In the event of a divorce. Really? Even with joint custody? In order for him to maintain housing on post, He has to take the children Six months and one day out of the year. Serious? He's in special ops. He never knows where he's gonna be. That's the problem. Then, other than the barracks, His only option is to live off post. Okay, so... One of us would have to drive the kids to school every day. Actually, the way this works, pamela, I'm afraid your children would have to attend school off post. Come on. They're still army kids. I know, and I wish I had a different answer, But... I can give you a list of public schools in your area. Regarding medical benefits, So long as your husband stays in the army, The children are eligible for full coverage. That's something. I lose my coverage... Yes. And there's one other thing. There's more? If you divorce, You have to surrender your military I.D. Card. You'd lose your privileges at the commissary and the p. X., And you'd have to get a visitor's pass Whenever you come on post. Um, and what about, um... Alimony and child support? The army would enforce whatever the court decides, And you qualify for a percentage of his basic housing allowance. Yeah? Should I even ask how much? That's it? Many of our single mothers, They choose to work at least part-time In order to supplement their monthly payments. No kidding. Okay. Um... Okay. Uh, thank you. You have been very helpful. I know it's a lot to absorb. Maybe you and your husband, you'll work things out. Yeah. Maybe. C.J., is that you? Grace? Oh, my god! It is you! Ohh! C.J. Meade! Well, holden now. Dennigan-shuster. Wow, "c. J." I haven't been called c. J. In... 20 years. I can't believe it's been that long. What are you doing here? Taking my daughter on a college tour. You? I'm on my way to teach a class. I'm a professor at the law school. Oh, great. Where did you end up practicing? Uh, actually, I didn't. I never finished my degree. Oh, I thought you were gonna go back After you took that semester off. So did I, and then I, um - I met this west point graduate, No kidding. How long are you in town? Till tomorrow afternoon. It would be so great to catch up. Listen, I've got a late class tonight, But how about brunch at my house tomorrow? Uh, does 10:00 work for you? Sure, I'd love to. I just need to check emmalin's schedule. I'm just two blocks from campus. Just let me know. Absolutely. It's good to see you. Yeah, same here. Is this all the progress you've made on the school? Colonel burton, To retrofit a building of this size is very complicated. It requires many hands. Mr. Al-ahmad, I wasn't here when you were hired, But I am aware of the problems you've been facing. Nevertheless, this project is way behind schedule, And it's our job to get it back on track. The way I see it, you and I are partners. Yes, of course, colonel. I understand we recently received additional funds To hire more workers. How's that going? Uh, they're coming, but I will only hire the best. Well, I'm not here to tell you who to hire, But I do expect a full workforce on-site by next Monday. Can you do that? Yes. Signed by you, on my desk by the end of each workday. Sergeant larson will give you the forms. Very good. I look forward to working together. Thank you, colonel. As do I. Ma'am, you do know where the extra money For those workers went, right? In his pocket. I don't know that, sergeant. But I do know there better be a full workforce here by Monday, Or we're hiring a new contractor. Yes, ma'am. Too bad I don't drive a semi or know how to pole dance. Plenty of opportunities for someone With the right job skills. You can learn how to pole dance. I'm joking. Yeah. Ugh, that a. C.S. Woman really freaked me out. I can't just keep sitting around here Waiting for chase to come home, and... I gotta cover my bases. And there's no way I'm selling my underwear on the front lawn. Well, it's not gonna come to that. Don't be so sure. How the hell am I gonna pay for an apartment and feed my kids? I was a cop over a decade ago. Fact is, I'm an army wife. That's my job. And if I quit that, Then what? Yo, ricky, you going to iraq? Afghanistan. That's where the action is. Awesome, dude. Hey, lucy. Can you believe this? Maybe I should sign up. No, are you serious? You can't even do two sit-ups. Neither could ricky. That was then. This is now. He's got that right, gentlemen. Sergeant leblanc. Hi. Hey. Look, when I first started recruiting private martinez, He was out of shape, but he set his mind on a goal, He worked hard and he achieved it. Now that's what we call "army strong." It's all about attitude. So how does this work? Tell you what. Why don't you two give me a call, And we can talk about what the army can do for you? You can trust him, man. He's been to iraq. He's won medals. Seriously? Just doing my job for our country, Like martinez is about to do. Call me. okay, cool. Bye, mom! Mom.

Martinez. The guy you brought back to the high school yesterday? He was supposed to report for soldier readiness processing This morning. It's one of the last steps before deployment. He didn't show, And he wasn't in the barracks last night, either. He's awol? I sure as hell hope not. Well, what are you gonna do? Find him. Mrs. Martinez? Hi. Sergeant leblanc. Remember?

Is this really you and hillary clinton? Yeah, that was taken last summer on martha's vineyard. Oh. Yeah, my husband and I are very active in the democratic party. I promise not to tell my dad. So how long were you with the d. A.'s office? Five years. Then I joined fenwick, steiner and stoll. I was up for a judgeship a few years back, But alex and I had decided That we were ready to leave the city. And now you're teaching. Yeah, and I love it. There's something special about being on a college campus again. I know. I know. I feel it, too. Well, what about you, c. J.? Tell me everything. Really? What was she like? Do you have any good stories? Oh, emmalin. I want to know. I'd plead the fifth, grace. Remember, I could tell stories about you, too. Objection sustained. But what I can tell you is that If anyone was gonna have a brilliant career in law, The smart money was on your mother. She's exaggerating. No, I am not. Your mother crushed the competition in moot court. Uh, moot court? Yeah, a simulated trial. Nobody wanted to go up against c. J. Meade. After her summations, you were dead. Really? Don't act so surprised. I'm not. Uh, that's so cool. Mm-hmm. But... Not the kind of story you were looking for? You do not want to go there. Yes, we do. What about boys? There's the quiche. Oh. Saved by the bell. Come on, emmalin. I can't believe you're calling again. I told you, I got it covered. I know, But it's sara elizabeth's first birthday. I want everything to be perfect.

Don't you have a school to rebuild or something? Yes, but tomorrow I've arranged my entire schedule Around the birthday cake. 1300, right? Affirmative, colonel. Just double-checking. You are way beyond double-checking. Look who's talking. Look, I have patients to see. You stay safe. I love you. I love you. Give sara elizabeth a big old kiss from mommy, And I'll see you at the party-1300. Bye, joan. Bye. Face it, leblanc. You got yourself a runner. I can't believe this. This ever happen to you? Once. Found the guy hiding under his girlfriend's bed. And how did you handle it? Oh, I tore him a new one. Told him, "your ass belongs to the army now, buddy boy. "you can't just change your mind "'cause, boo-hoo, you don't feel like going. No, you signed a contract, took an oath." Then I told him I had the m. P.S waiting outside To take him to jail if he didn't come with me. You brought the m. P.S? Martinez, he's a good kid. He's kinda sensitive. To hell with that. No, you find him. You tell him to grow up, shut up, suck it up. Remember, he's making you look bad, leblanc. Martinez, it's sergeant leblanc again. You gotta call me back. Michael? Hey! There are my girls. Hi, dad! Oh. Hey, how was your trip? It was totally awesome! The girls on the team are so friendly, And they're all mad fierce on the ice. And one of 'em played with team canada in the olympics. And the campus is like- like you wouldn't believe. They've got, like, 30 different kinds of cereal In the dining hall. 30, huh? It's true. And we had brunch with this friend of mom's Who's really cool from harvard law. Yeah. She's a professor at the law school now, And she knows the clintons, and she's really nice. Really? mm-hmm. And... I know I'm forgetting a lot, But I have a ton of homework, And I promised I'd call jennifer, so can we talk later? Sure. Oh. Thank you so much, mom! oh, you're so welcome, honey. Successful trip. Oh, totally awesome. I want to hear all about it. Mm. Oh, I missed you, too. Mm. Mm. I thought you wanted to hear all about the trip. In due course. Mm. So what's for dinner? Spaghetti. With meatballs? And garlic bread? Of course with meatballs and garlic bread. Finn, come inside. Who are you? More soda? No, thank you, ma'am. I should go. Oh, no. It's no problem, and trevor's on his way. Mom, when are we gonna eat? In a little while, okay? Are you in trouble? In your room, mister, now. Sorry about that. I shouldn't have come. No, the boys are fine. They're always hungry. Martinez. I got here as fast as I could. Thanks, babe. Sure. I'll be in the back with the boys. Sit down. So what's going on? Come on. You didn't come all this way not to tell me. I'm scared. I don't want to die. I get that. Man, I was scared, too. But that's where your training comes in. You hit the ground, you're with your buddies, And everything clicks into place. I don't think I can. I know you can. Why did you join the army? You remember the reasons you gave me? "I want to make something of myself." I want to make my parents proud. And you've done those things. You're not a kid anymore. You're a soldier. And there's another thing you said to me. Remember? "I want to serve my country." I still do, sergeant, but I can't help it. I'm scared. You don't think your buddies are scared? Everybody gets scared. Think about this- you don't deploy, You're leaving your unit a man down. Now in combat, That can be the difference between life and death. You understand what I'm saying? I need more time. There is no more time, martinez. Anyone else in my position would've hauled you in already. Listen... I am on your side. You know that, right? It's because I need you to understand how serious this is. We're talking dishonorable discharge, Prison time. I don't mean to let you down, sergeant. Okay. It's not about me. It's about you. Being scared is okay. The trick is not giving in to it. Everything you have been training for Is right in front of you. Don't turn your back on it now. Now I know sergeant hicks. I could probably buy you till taps tomorrow, But that's it. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm trusting you. Go home. Think it over. Call me tomorrow with your decision. Either I'm taking you back to the barracks, Or we're going to the office of the provost marshal. It's your call. Yes, sergeant. How'd it go? How's it look? Perfect. Hey, y'all. Hey. Hey, rox. Wow. What, too much? No. N-n-n-no. It's great. It's just too bad it's gonna get lost On a bunch of 1 year olds. Well, it's not really for sara elizabeth. It's for joan. You think she'll like it? She's gonna love it. Absolutely. Check out this cake. Special order from the commissary. Number 19. yes, that's us! Can I help you? Uh, we have a cake emergency. A friend of ours bought a custom cake here The other day, and - right, and he dropped it. Yeah, it was a total disaster. So we need another one. All right. When do you need it? In, like, a half hour. Custom cakes require 24 hours' advance notice. I mean, that's minimum. But this is a special circumstance. Very special. See, it's a 1 year old's birthday party, And her mom's a colonel in iraq. Wait. Was this the castle cake? Yes, that's the one. Oh, man. I did that, but it took me hours. It was amazing... Until it got smashed. Ooh. And our friend's wife is connecting by video chat In an hour, and she expects to see a castle cake. She's out of luck. Don't get your panties in a bunch, irma. There's gotta be something we could do. I'm on break. Is she always like that? Only on the good days. Okay, now I can't start from scratch... But maybe I don't have to. Really? You have an idea? Hey, we army wives gotta stick together, right? You bet. What about this? Um, it's a wedding cake. Now it's a castle cake. Well, almost. give me 20 minutes. Yeah, you got it. You're an angel... Marisol. Well, don't thank me yet. Oh, remind me- What's the name of our little princess again? sara elizabeth. And there's no "h" at the end of sara. Got it. Gimme back my tiara! Katie, don't run. Yes! At last. What do you think? Well, given that the cake cutting Is in t-minus 2 minutes, 32 seconds and counting, It's fantastic. Okay. I'm going to check on the computer, Make sure everything's set up for the video chat with joan. all right. I'll light the candle. Get ready to see your mama, birthday girl. Okay. Ma'am, there's been an accident. You're needed on the building site, asap. Let's go. The connection's fine. Problem's not on this end. Those satellite hookups often go down over there. Yeah, I can't tell you how many times That happened to me with frank. I gotta go. Martinez. We want cake! We want cake! Okay, shh. Hey, quiet. Quiet, quiet! Hey. Hey! We are waiting for colonel burton. It's joan. She can't make it. Ohh. Some kind of problem at work. Sorry, roland. Michael's taking video. She'll still see it. Right. All right. General, we set? Can I help sara elizabeth blow out the candle? Sure thing, buddy. That would be nice. Okay, but, finn, just wait - we have to sing first. The fire on the upper floor weakened the structure, Causing the collapse, ma'am. Casualties? Ten injured, two serious. All iraqi. How'd it start? It looks accidental, ma'am. Acetylene torch too close to the building materials. Negligence. Where's al-ahmad? Witnesses saw him drive away, ma'am, After the collapse. Hi, again.

Good night, birthday girl. Sweet dreams. Ohh. So cute. ohh. I know. I just can't get it out of my mind. What if chase and I split up? No money, no housing, And the kids will have to change schools. What?! Katie! Katie, wait. Katie. Katie, unlock this door. No. Katharine eileen, unlock this door right now. And this is certainly no way to behave at a party. No. Go away. Okay. Um, I... I need to explain. You don't have to come out, but you do have to let me in. Katie? I'm gonna count to five. You unlock this door or no tv for a month. I mean it. One... Two... Three... Four... hey. Honey... I'm sorry that you heard what I said to mrs. Leblanc. But nothing has been decided yet. I don't wanna have to go to a new school. I know that. Why is daddy getting transferred again? What? If we have to go to a new school, That means daddy's getting transferred, Doesn't it? No. Um... No. I was just... But nothing's happening right now. You mean it? Yeah. Good, 'cause I don't want to live anywhere else. I don't either. But... Life doesn't always work out The way we want it to. Come here. Come here. No matter what, We always have each other, okay?

But don't forget, school comes first. I'm so going there if I get in. Hmm. Don't you want to wait and see a few other schools Before you decide? Why? I mean, you have to admit, woodsen was awesome. The hockey program is fantastic... Mm-hmm. It's not too far from home, And I've already made friends there. Plus, I've got a connection on the faculty With professor shuster, thanks to you, c. J.

You know, being on that, uh, college campus, Seeing emmalin's excitement, then running into grace, It was all so energizing. I felt like doors were opening again. What doors are we talking about? I don't know. I guess I'm talking about... What comes next. You know, once, uh... Once emmalin goes off to school, That part of our lives will be ending. Maybe something is starting, too. Like... I want to finish my law degree. ♪ For the right raindrop to set them free ♪ As in take the bar and work at a law firm? Well... I haven't thought that far ahead. I was just talking about finishing my degree. It's always been in the back of my mind. I was good at it. I enjoyed it. And I'm all for it. Yeah? Absolutely.
