 Previously on Army Wives... Well, you know that detective that I was working with from Atlanta? Mmm-hmm. She talked to her bosses about me, and they're interested. You said before that I had to choose between Delta or you. What is this? That is my request to transfer out of Delta. What are you saying? I choose you. Marry me. Mom, I'm getting married.

 Oh, my God. It's gonna be okay. No, no, that's not it, Jeremy. My water just broke. Mom's having the baby, now. - Son of a... - She can hear you, sir. Yeah. Denise... Hi. - She is such a little angel. - Just wait. - Still colicky? - Oh, yeah. I thought Jeremy was bad... Yeah, well, I'd rather have a colicky baby than a crabby teenager any day. - I thought T.J. was 12. - Yeah, he's 12 going on 16. I swear he suddenly woke up like a completely different person.

 He doesn't want to do his chores, he doesn't want to play with Finn. - He stays in his room all the time. - Well, we all know what that means. Oh, no, do not even go there. I'm just saying you might want to see what kind of magazines he's keeping under his mattress. Trust me, I do not. That's perfectly natural. I'm just saying. You'd better strap yourself in, Roxy. The teen years are not for the faint of heart. High drama, high stress. And the worst part? Just when things start to get better, they leave. Tomorrow's the big day, huh? I can't believe my baby's going to college. Well, just wait until your baby calls and tells you he's getting married. Oh, that's right. Tomorrow's the day you meet Jeremy's mystery fianc?e. Are you excited? I don't know that "excited" is the right word. Not that I don't want to meet her. It's just incredibly weird. I mean, I'm gonna be a mother-in-law. Ah, yes, the hyphenate that strikes fear in the hearts of women everywhere. And I suppose you love your mother-in-law, huh? Well, she never visits, she never calls. What's not to love? - I got to go home and see my wife. - Oh, sure, rub it in. You've got someone to go home to. Unlike the four Ds here. The four Ds? Deployed, deployed, deployed, divorced. - You are still divorced, aren't you? - Roxy. Inquiring minds want to know. Yeah, what's up with that, Pamela? Well, it's complicated. I've moved on and the kids have adjusted and what if I get that job in Atlanta? You still haven't heard anything? No, and the suspense is killing me. And meanwhile, Chase is just waiting for an answer? I told him I needed time to think about it, and the next day he was called on a training mission, so thank God I've got some time. There it is. Just like clockwork. Here. I better try and get her to sleep. Sounds like our cue. Ah. See you later. Bye. - Thanks for coming. Bye. Talk to you later. Oh, Claudia Joy, you don't need to do that. - Please, it takes a second. - Thanks. So, college. Yeah. And you, marriage. Right. You ready? No. You? Oh, God, no. Oh, it's gonna be a hell of a year. Check the tires? - Michael, the car is fine. Don't worry. It's my job to worry. Mom, do we have any more packing tape? I think so. Say hi to your father. Hey! Hey, kiddo. You all set for your trip? Yep. - Here you go. - Thank you. Should we be insulted that she's so happy to leave home? Michael, it's the natural order of things for kids to want to be as far away from their parents as possible. What if I could change that? - What do you mean? - It's too early to make plans, but I've just been told I'm on the short list for superintendent of West Point. It would mean a third star and we'd be closer to Em. Not exactly the reaction I was looking for. No, no, Michael, it's a huge honor. Congratulations. But? I guess I was just so focused on graduating law school and taking the bar, I forgot you never make plans in the Army. You can always take the bar in New York. Of course. And West Point would be fabulous. - I'm really proud of you. - Thank you, but it's not a done deal yet. Still, exciting to think about, though. Did she just take our toaster? You're up early. I get my new assignment today. I guess I'm a little on edge. Hmm. About deployment? The possibility, anyway. You know, Roland, I've been thinking. Maybe it's time. - Time for what? - To get out. Retirement? You serious? Despite what you think, I have been listening to my doctors and I know that if I get injured again, it could be worse. Might not be able to beat a brain injury next time. And, if we want to have another kid, well, I'm not getting any younger. I've got 20 years in. I guess this means you're open to the idea. Toby Jack LeBlanc, get in here! What is wrong with this picture? - It is your job to feed and water the mutt. - I was going to. "Going to" when? We're leaving for school right now. Do it. Hurry up. - Okay. - What? Yes, ma'am. Here you go. And don't forget that Jimmy's mom is bringing you home today, okay? And after that, T.J.'s in charge. I like not having a babysitter anymore. I'm sure that you do. Go get in the van. Make sure that you come home right after school because I don't want Finn alone, okay? - You got it? - Got it. Okay. And don't forget to call me as soon as you get here so that I don't worry. Okay? Okay? - Okay. Okay. - Okay. Here. Go. You're missing all the fun, babe. Hey. Aren't you cold? No. - So what do you think? - I think our old car was fine. It's too bad because our old car is now my old car. This here heap belongs to you. Probation's over. Time to take the training wheels off, Moran. My own car? You sound disappointed. No, I just didn't think I'd be going solo so soon. Aw, you're gonna miss me. God help me, I just might. It's Atlanta PD. Take it. Hello? Yeah. Okay. Okay. So I'll talk to you at the end of the week? Thank you. I got the job! I got the job! Wow. Congratulations. But I guess I'm gonna be needing these back. - No, I'm not quitting. - Interesting. Two jobs, 300 miles apart. That's a hell of a commute, Moran. No, I mean, I'm not quitting yet. They gave me until the end of the week to give them an answer. And you're not jumping at it because... - You know why. - Right, the ex. What are you gonna do? I wish I knew. This is all so crazy. If they had called even a month ago, I'd already be in Atlanta. So don't take it. Yeah, but it's such a huge opportunity. I mean, it took my brother nine years to make detective. My dad never made it. Okay, so take it. But Delta was a big reason that we got divorced. If he's really ready to give that up, then maybe we can work things out. Pamela, I love you, but I cannot keep having this conversation. I'm sorry. I know. I'm even boring myself. No, it's not that. Every time you bring up Atlanta, it just reminds me over and over again that you might be leaving. And I'm not gonna lie, that is going to suck for me. So, yes, I want you to be happy. And, yes, I will support any decision that you make, but... Oh, my God. What? Who is that? That's Finn's dad. So should I stay or go? Uh, go. Okay. And you'll call me later? Hey, Rox. You look good. Thanks, Whit. What are you doing here? I'm not here to cause trouble or nothing. I thought you should know that Daddy died. Hank died? When? Last month. Uh, come on, sit down. - How did he pass? - Lung cancer. Damn cigarettes. Every time I'd come over, I'd look for those cartons and flush them down the toilet. I know. I think Daddy knew, too. He just couldn't quit. Listen, there's another reason I came. Daddy left behind a little bit of money and... Whit, no, I don't need your money. Okay, but I need to give it to you. Please, Rox. I've never been in a position to do anything for Finn. I mean, not once in his whole life. I know this don't make up for anything and it ain't even all that much. But do whatever you want to with it, no strings attached. Whit, there's like a thousand dollars in here. Yes, ma'am. And Hank and I both would be real happy if you took it. I will put it towards his college fund. College? He's real smart. He's practically a genius. Damn. And where did that come from? Hell if I know. Let me get you some food before you take off. We have got the best gumbo you've ever had in your whole life. Better than Sonny's? Way better than Sonny's. - They're late. - What else is new? Hey, Sergeant! Where are the rest of your men? This is all I have. A squad is supposed to have eight men, not five. Look, it is up to you to maintain discipline. You've got to show up, full squad on time, ready to roll, you understand? Where's your helmet? It's hot. Put the damn helmet on. All right, move out! - This is messed up, man. - Tell me about it. Good morning, Colonel. Forgive the unconventional meeting, but I wanted to give you this news myself. What news is that, sir? You're being promoted, Joan. Below the zone, full bird. Congratulations, Colonel. - Thank you, sir. - No one's more deserving. You've overcome huge challenges this year, Joan. Which makes your new assignment all the more remarkable. New assignment? Garrison Commander? Right here at Fort Marshall. In charge of post infrastructure. Wow. What'd you say? What'd I say? It's Garrison Commander. And a promotion. So no retirement. I'm sorry, Roland. I never saw this coming. But this assignment means that I won't have to deploy. We won't be PCSed any time soon. It'll be more like a regular job. And I'm still open to the other thing. The other thing. A baby? Stability is a hard thing to come by in the Army. So the timing might be perfect. It's certainly worth exploring. I do like exploring. I know you do. Oh, goodness. So, you decide? - Yeah. - What? To not think about it until I absolutely have to. Come on, Moran. This shouldn't be that hard. Fish or cut bait. Thank you. That really helps. Okay, you know what we're gonna do? After work, Taco Boy, sit down, sort all this stuff out. What are we gonna, make a list of pros and cons? If we have to, yes. And if that doesn't work, we'll flip a coin. What do you say? Two-for-one margaritas. I'll see you there. I think you should get a dog. What? I googled "empty-nest syndrome" and a lot of the websites recommend that parents get a dog when their kid leaves home. It fills the void. First, do you really think a dog could replace you? And why on earth are you googling "empty-nest syndrome"? It would be different if Dad was here. Oh. But you're gonna be all alone now. Excuse me, I do have friends, you know. Sure, but you still come home to this big, old empty house. Get a dog. Mom? Yeah! Yeah, I'm coming. How'd it go out there, Sherwood? As you were. - Patrol was uneventful, sir. - Good, good. That's the way we like it. So, Son, getting married. That's a big step. Yes, sir. It is. Good. Because I know how it can get in theater. You know, it's... It's easy to get swept away. - You think I'm making a mistake? - No, no. No, I'm not saying that. I just want to make sure you understand what a big decision this is, you know? Dad, how long did it take for you to fall in love with Mom? Okay, okay, okay. But your mother and I, we didn't get married for another eight months, you know? We took some time, got to know each other better. But what if you didn't wait? You don't think it would've worked? The point is that you loved each other, right? - Yeah. - That's what really matters. Dad, trust me, I'm all squared away on this. Okay, then. All right. Keep your eyes open out there. Hooah. Mrs. Sherwood? Tanya. Please, call me Denise. Come in. - Hi. - I'm sorry. These are for you. Snickerdoodles. Jeremy said they're a family favorite. Yeah, yeah. Thanks. Come on in. Please have a seat. So, can I get you anything to drink? Some tea, water? - No, thank you, I'm good. - Okay, good. So, you're marrying my son. I guess so. I even got the ring to prove it. Is that parachute cord? Well, there aren't a lot of jewelry stores in theater, so Jeremy had to improvise. Right, right. Things did happen pretty fast, huh? How long have you known Jeremy? - About four weeks. - Four weeks. Wow. Exciting. It's so nice to finally meet you. And, of course, I've already met your husband. - Oh, you have? - Yeah. I mean, I'm sure he wouldn't remember me, but I did see him in the aid station. He's really old-school, isn't he? Old-school? Yeah, you know, iron jaw, "Duty, honor, country." Not that there's anything wrong with that. It's just... He and Jeremy are so different. Different how? Well, Colonel Sherwood is so disciplined. Not that Jeremy isn't disciplined. I mean, he's... He's a good soldier. But the Colonel is, you know, so John Wayne. That's not quite right. You know what I mean. So, what... Tell me about yourself. Jeremy says that you're... You're going Green to Gold. Med school, right? Originally I was gonna study nursing. But then I got in the field, started watching the surgeons and thought, "Why be just a nurse?" I guess Jeremy didn't mention that I'm just a nurse. No, he didn't. Yeah, I've been working recently as a paramedic, but I spent most of my career as an RN. It's a wonderful field and in my experience, nurses are just as vital to a hospital as surgeons are. I know. Believe me, I would never... You know what? I think I will take that glass of water. She didn't like me. Come on, I'm sure that's not true. - I just don't like her. Why, baby? What happened? Everything I said came out wrong. It was like an out-of-body experience. I wanted to yell at myself, "Stop talking!" You were just nervous, that's all. My mom will understand. I don't understand. Why the rush? They hardly know each other. And they're so young. God, they are practically babies! D, they are hardly babies. They've been to war, seen combat. You'd think after living in a war zone I'd be able to face anything. But no. Apparently mothers-in-law scare the crap out of me. You're putting too much pressure on yourself, okay? Just relax. I mean, if you want, I can talk to her. No! God, no. Frank, I really think you should talk to him. I already did. Remember, D, my mom wasn't too keen on you at first, either. Don't remind me. Yeah, exactly. So, you know, give her a chance, all right? For Jeremy. You got to cut my mom some slack. She just needs a little time. And don't forget, the important thing. I love you. Okay? Okay. I love you, too. Okay, Frank. Love you. Yeah, I love you, too, D. - So, what do you think? - Well, I think you over-packed. Emmalin! Jamie! Hey! - Wow. Finally, in person. - I know! You know, when I went to college, we didn't know our roommate's name before we showed up at school. God, that would suck. Seriously. I mean, how did people live before Facebook? Hey, a couple guys from the lacrosse team invited us to a party tonight. Sweet. Can we get in the locker room today? - I want to stow my gear. Yep, it's open until 4:00. But you need to get your student ID first. Now remember, you're just an old friend from Alabama. Nothing else. I promise, Rox. I just want to see him, that's all. Okay. Finn, what on earth are you doing? I wanted to seal a letter like Harry Potter does in the movies. See? I got Dad's ring to make a cool design in the wax. Honey, you are not supposed to be playing with candles. Or matches or lighters or anything having to do with fire. Where is your brother? T. J! You are supposed to be looking after your brother, not letting him burn the house down. - Who's he? - Do you hear me? Yes. Yes, ma'am. Okay. Boys, this is Whit. He is an old friend from Alabama. He's a contractor. What's a contractor? That means I build things. Houses and stuff. Cool! Where's Lucky? T.J., you let the dog out! Lucky! Lucky! I can't believe this. He'll come home when he's ready. A dog running loose on the post is a violation. If the MPs catch Lucky before we do, then we get a fine for sure. Well, y'all come on, then. If there's one thing I know, it's dogs and hunting. That's two things. I guess that's so, Bubba. Come on, let's go! Here, boy! Lucky! Hey, have y'all seen a dog running around? Yeah? There he is! - Lucky! Lucky! Dang, girl. That's louder than I remember. Come here. - Come here, you mangy mutt. Come on. Come on, boy. - We missed you. Good dog. That's a fine-looking dog, Rox. He reminds me a little of Banjo. - Banjo? Banjo only had three legs. - I said a little. Uh-oh. Mom, are we in trouble? Are you sure you don't need anything else before I go? - Mom... - Extra towels or... - Mom. ...extension cords. Mom, I'm fine. I promise. But if you keep stalling, I'm gonna be late to my first team meeting. All right. Come here, you. Oh, I love you, sweetheart. What's this? Just a little something I think you're going to need. I got to go. Thanks, Mom. I love you, too. I don't know. I mean, I don't want to keep Chase waiting for an answer, but you got to be sure, right? Okay, stop. Just stop. It's not that hard, Moran. - Really? - Yeah, really. Look, I'm a pretty simple guy. But in my world, either you want something or you don't. Well, it must be nice to live there. I'm serious. Pamela, look at me. If you really wanted to go back to your ex, you wouldn't need a week to think about it. You would've turned that job down flat. And if you wanted that job, you'd be halfway to Atlanta right now. Maybe you're confused because deep down, you know you don't want either one. Maybe you're still waiting for the right offer. Don't go back with your ex and don't take that job. Stay here in Charleston, with me. Think about it. Well, those MP guys sure don't have a sense of humor. That sign said "Do not walk on the grass." Said nothing about driving on it. It reminds me of that time that we went mudding on Lincoln High's football field the night before the homecoming game. Boy howdy, did we get in trouble for that. We? Darling, I don't remember the sheriff knocking on your door. Well, that's because I wasn't the one driving. No, ma'am, but it was your idea. If you're stupid enough to listen to me... Hello? Hello? God, did I wake you up? No, no, it's fine. And I woke the baby. I'm so sorry! It's okay. Really. Look, I just called to say goodbye. Goodbye? Are you leaving? Well, my folks are waiting for me down in Florida and besides, you need your rest and Molly hasn't been feeling well and I just don't think this was a good time to come. No, Tanya, don't leave. I know things were a little awkward with us today, but I do want to get to know you better. Can you come for lunch tomorrow? I really should be going. You're going to be family soon. Please. Okay. That would be nice. - Noon? - Sounds perfect. Good. I'll see you then. Boys are asleep. Two's my limit now. Boy, things have changed, haven't they? Yeah. Well, who would've thought way back in high school you'd end up here? Nice house, great family, business owner. You're downright respectable, Rox. I suppose that's so. The truth is, when I left Tuscaloosa, I had no idea what the hell I was getting myself into. It turns out Army life is real different. A lot of rules, people always looking at you, judging you. You know, when I first got here, every single day I felt like I needed to be somebody different. What changed? I did, I guess. - But you're happy? - Yeah, of course. It's great having a real family. Even if Trevor is halfway around the world. Sometimes I feel like I'm right back where I've always been. A single mom working in a bar. I bet it's hard you having them boys on your own like that. I never stopped feeling guilty about the way things went down. It was my choice to go it alone. Yeah, but I shouldn't have let you. I should've done right by my boy. You did. You let Trevor adopt Finn. I know that wasn't easy for you, but you did it because it was what was best for him. You did right by us both. Well... I guess I ought to be going. Are you sure you're okay to drive? - Hey, give me those keys. - Come on, Rox. You would not make it out of this neighborhood before the MPs stopped you. You think they take walking on the grass seriously? Try them with a DUI. Inside, mister. Uh-uh-uh. Boots. Hey. Here you go. You know something, Rox? I'm glad I came. Me, too. What are you doing here? Huh? Hey, bud. It's me, Whit, remember? Your mama's friend. It's okay. I wasn't feeling well. She let me sleep here. Get out! Whoa, whoa, whoa. What did you just say? - Why is he here? - Do not sass me. This is Whit. He's my friend. Like the friends you used to have before Dad? You apologize. No! If Dad was here, he would kick his ass and you know it. T.J., get in your room right now! And do not come out until I tell you different, you hear me? I'm sorry, Rox. The last thing I want to do is make trouble for you. No, I'm sorry. T.J.'s been on a real tear lately. He's a growing boy. Just feeling his oats, is all. That Finn's a character, huh? He sure is. Thanks for letting me come. Drive safe. And stay off the grass, you hear? Yes, ma'am. He kissed you? Like, really kissed you? Like he meant it? Oh, yeah, he definitely meant it. So, what did you do? Honestly, I don't even know. Did you kiss him back? Maybe. I don't know. I was just so shocked. But you didn't push him away? No. Pamela Moran, you hussy. Stop it! Okay, so spill. Was he a good kisser? Roxy. Come on! When's the last time you kissed a guy? Especially a guy who's not Chase? All right, yes, he was a good kisser. Bow-chicka-bow-wow. Roxy! Pamela, you are divorced. You're a free agent. I mean, you could've slept with Boone and it wouldn't have been breaking any rules. Did you sleep with Boone? What? No! Did you think about sleeping with Boone? Okay, clearly your husband is deployed and you are living vicariously through me. Damn straight I am. So? Yes, for a brief moment, I might have thought about sleeping with Boone. Now can we please change the subject? How did it go with Finn's dad? Good. It was really good to see him again. Really good, huh? - How good is really good? - Don't. See, you can dish it out, but you can't take it. Nothing happened. We talked, we had a few beers. You okay? I just wish Trevor were home. Yeah. That would make things easier, wouldn't it? Whit was never really marriage material. We were just friends. One night I was upset and I called him over. And we were just sitting there, holding each other. When I found out I was pregnant with Finn, I didn't even want to tell him. He was just a kid. Well, so were you. We might have been the same age, but I'd already had T.J. and been married and divorced. I hadn't been a kid for years. I guess that's why I liked being around him so much. He made me feel like a normal teenager. Like a normal, crazy teenager. And how does he make you feel now? Like myself again. Damn deployment. Damn Atlanta. Damn everything. Fort Marshall is like a city. And being Garrison Commander is like having every job of city government all at once, mayor, city planner, school board, you name it. Every department on post reports to you. And it's my job to keep everyone happy, right? Yeah, good luck with that. If you don't have half a dozen departments pounding at your door at any given time, you're probably not doing your job right. Noted. While other commanders on post command soldiers, you command paper. For example, the Provost Marshal wants to outsource security at the entrance gate. The high school needs a new gym. The FRG wants intramural sports for the spouses. The parking lot at the commissary needs to be repaved. So have you thought about what kind of medicine you're gonna study? Not really. Med school is a ways off. I've got to finish my undergrad first. Did you know that Jeremy wanted to study architecture? - He mentioned something about that. - He's also a really talented artist. I could show you some of his drawings, if you'd like. That'd be great. That nap didn't last long. Care to hold your future sister-in-law? - Sure. - Okay. Come on. Did you spit up again? I'm gonna run out of clean clothes for you, little lady. Can you hold her for a second? I'll get a new onesie. Here, baby. Here you go. Here. Is she sick? No, she's just colicky. Jeremy was the same way. I don't know. She feels a little warm. And she's crying, but her eyes are dry. You think she could be dehydrated? Trust me, it's just colic. I'm just saying maybe it's worth a trip to the doctor. What you're saying is I don't know how to take care of my own child. Denise, I'm not saying that at all. I just thought... I may be just a nurse, but I think I can handle this, okay? I'm sorry. I'm sorry I said anything. I'm sorry you don't like me, I'm sorry I'm not who you wanted for Jeremy. I'm just... I'm gonna go. Here we go. Come on. Well, if it isn't our new Garrison Commander. - How was your day? - Oh, it's not over yet. I just came to say good night to Sara Elizabeth. Well, you're not staying for dinner? Can't. I'm already behind and I haven't even started yet. Whatever happened to "it's just a regular job"? Well, it'll slow down. - Joan. - Roland. Look, I knew when I took this position that it would be a lot of work, but it's not until you actually sit behind that desk that you realize how much work. It's probably best not to make any plans right now. What do you mean? I don't think the timing is right for a baby. Right. But you said it was perfect timing. I'm not saying never. I'm just saying not right now. You said it yourself, we're not getting any younger. If not now, when? Roland, if I do this job right, I could end up with a star. Think about that. Me, a General in the United States Army. It's okay, baby. Shh... Oh, baby, you're burning up. Hello? Claudia Joy, there's something wrong with Molly. Can you meet me at the emergency room? - Of course. I'm on my way. - Okay. I'm so sorry, baby.
