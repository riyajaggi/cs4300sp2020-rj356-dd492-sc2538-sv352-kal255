You want some coffee or some sweet tea? No. No, thanks. Um... Everything okay? Yeah. I-I-I've got some... some news. You're not being transferred, are you? No. whew. Okay. That's a relief. Yeah. Well, what is it? Wow. I never expected to be saying this... But... I'm pregnant. What? R-really? I know. Wow. Yeah. I was as shocked as you are. Um... Yeah, I-in... in a good way. I... I ju... I just don't know what to say is all. Well, don't say anything. God, the last thing I wanted to do was add to your pain, But I didn't want you to hear it from anyone else. Um, I did... I did not know it was gonna be this hard. I'm sorry. Oh, don't be. I mean, Because I really am so happy for you, Denise. You know that, right? Yeah. No, it's... it's just a case of bad timing, That's all. No. No, it is never a bad time for babies. God. I guess this just proves that you never know What's around the corner, right? Right. Congratulations. Oh! Pamela, hi. Joan. How you doing? Great. Listen, Roland's been delayed at the office, But he shouldn't be more than a few minutes. Well, I could come back. Oh, no, no, no. The baby's sleeping. Uh, welcome home, by the way. Thank you. So what's up? Uh, nothing. I was just gonna... Pick Roland's brain. All right. Well, get comfortable. He won't be long. Okay. You must be so happy to be home, huh? Oh, ah. You can't imagine. I miss them so much when I'm away. I don't know how you do it. Yeah, it's heartbreaking. But, hey, that's the army, right? Can I get you something? No, thanks. I can't imagine being away so long. Yesterday when I... Came home, Sara Elizabeth didn't respond to me. And I couldn't get her to settle down last night. Roland had to do it. Wow. Yeah. I know that'll change, but I... I was asking myself, Why do I put my family through that? Why do I put myself through that? Why do you? What does Chase tell you? Not much. But... He doesn't want to leave delta. I take it that's a problem. Yeah. Well, if he's like other operators I know... It's not that he won't leave delta. He can't. You see, for soldiers like us, The army isn't just a job. It's our life. God knows, I love my family. But when duty calls, I answer. It's who I am. I can't explain it any better than that. Yeah. Airborne rangers, Airborne rangers, where have you been? Airborne rangers, airborne rangers, How did you go? Airborne rangers, airborne rangers, Where have you been? Airborne rangers, airborne range, Where have you been? Column right, March! Left, left! Left, right! Left! Left! Left, right! Left! Left! Left! Left! Hey. Hey. I was just driving around, thinking. You remember our second or third date? You took me to that comedy club, And we were having the best time. Then the guy on stage picks me out, And he says, "you, sir, I-I-is that your wife?" And I said "no." And he says, "well, is it your girlfriend?" And I said, um... "no." And then, you remember? He says... "well, what is she?" And I said... What'd I say, exactly? You said... "she's just a pretty girl That was nice enough to take me out." Yeah. Yeah, that's what I said. I've loved you For as long as I can remember, Pamela. But I don't know how to fix this. I know. I don't either. The fracture to her tibia extends into the knee joint. Her inability to perform a straight leg raise indicates A serious disruption of the surrounding tendons. You're gonna need surgery. What kind of surgery? We have to realign the patella. That's the kneecap. How? I won't know until I get in there. But we may have to use A combination of screws and wires. Recovery time? For the bone to set, several weeks. Rehab, six months. Six months?! Well, how long before I'm on the ice again? That's hard to say. Could be a year. A year?! Emmalin. That's if there isn't permanent trauma to the joint. What's... what's the likelihood of that? Depends on what we find, how well she heals. Metal implants can be tricky. That's great. Let's not worry yet. You'll need to stop at the scheduling desk. Set a date for the procedure. Emmalin, in the meantime, Keep up with your pain management, And let me know if you have any questions. I'm available. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Hey, look what the team sent over. Cookies! And they all signed it. "we miss you. Come back soon." Yeah. No chance of that. We don't know that yet. Yeah, we do. I checked online, dad. Fractured knees are, like, career-enders. It's not like a torn a.C.L. Or something. You know, the Internet's full of free advice. Doesn't mean it's all true. I can't play hockey for at least a year, if ever. That's up to you. What do you mean, "it's up to me"?! I'm having major surgery, dad. My leg is never gonna be the same again! Sorry. I'm just upset. I know. I know. So... What? You just gonna give up without a fight? So... No. That's my girl. Thanks, dad. I'm in your corner. Frank? I'm... I'm not sure how this is gonna go, d. Aren't you happy about having a baby? Of course I am. I just don't want to screw it up again, that's all. At are you talking about? I'm talking about being a piss-poor father, that's what. I'm talking about Jeremy and his troubles. That falls directly but being aon my shoulders. R, that's what. No, that's not true. Frank, you did the best you could, and so did I. And Jeremy loves and respects you. Frank? Nah, for s... For some reason, I'm just... Not as sure about things as I was when... We had Jeremy. I mean, raising a boy today, it's... It's... I-I-it's different. I mean, it's a d... It's a different world. Could be a girl, Frank. Oh, God. Wha... well, what am I gonna do then? I mean, can you see me raising a girl? Wow. Hmm. Yeah. We'll figure this out. Okay. Hey. Hi. Denise came to see me today. Hmm. She and Frank are expecting. What? Yeah. They're having a baby. Wow. I didn't even know they were trying. They didn't either. Denise was told that she couldn't have any more kids. It's kind of a miracle. How you doing? You okay? I wasn't at first. I am now. I'm... Actually better. How are u? Me? I mean... You know... Maybe... We won't get pregnant again Until we've been married for 20 years. Maybe it'll be next week. The point is, I want to keep trying. Yeah? Yeah. What do you think about that? Are you joking? No. I mean, you were upset, too. I was. And I still think about it. But the idea of us having our own kid together... Our own little boy or girl... That's something I'm never giving up on.
