 They're taking her to Germany for further treatment. You haven't mentioned anything about my new look. You're alive. There's nothing more beautiful than that. "Congratulations. You are one of the six nominees for the Spenser award." You won't believe who else has been nominated. I do hope we can be friendly competitors. Excuse me, won't you? You've got a lot of food downstairs. How many people are coming to this breakfast anyway? Mm, there are six nominees and three foundation members. Well, I hope they're hungry. I stole one of your sausages, just so you know. Oh. You're on report. Seriously, I'm excited for you.

 Just being nominated is a huge honor. Knock, knock. You wanted to see me? I did. Your mother is being wined and dined tonight as part of her whole Spenser award activities. - I was wondering if you were free. - I'm being jilted? You jilted me first. - Well, what did you have in mind? - Double veggie burgers and a movie? I pick the movie... Deal. It's a date. I'll text you. Impressive. That's sweet. Hey, you're taking her on her first college visit next week. I want equal time. It won't be long before she's not around anymore. Michael, it's too early in the morning to get sentimental, and I have a breakfast to run. It was two sausages, wasn't it? Whew. Wow, would you look at the time? See you later. Yeah. Come and get it. Mmm. Now who is ready for chocolate chip pancakes? I am. Me, too! - How many do we get? - As many as you want, but first... Your father and I have a very special announcement. What do you think, babe? You think we should tell 'em? Tell us what? Mm. I don't know. Maybe we should wait. Yeah, it's too special. I just... You know what? Yeah, never mind. Forget it. You know... No, come on. Tell us now. All right, come here. Drumroll, please. Take 'Er away. Mommy is pregnant. Wow. Come on. Your mom's having a baby. Really? Why? Uh, because we thought it would be fun for you guys to have a little baby brother or a baby sister. How's your leg today, major? I'm not quite ready for a 20-mile march, ma'am. But give me a week. When are you headed home? Any day now. Depends on the flights. You, ma'am? I'm going back to theater. The doctor wants to monitor my progress a little while longer. Then it's boots on the ground. I'm jealous. Brought in last night. How you doing, lieutenant? Sorry I-I can't salute, ma'am. Is there anything I can do for you? How about an Al's Italian beef? Wet or dry? You're from Chicago? South side, born and raised. - You? - Near north. - Oh. Cubs fan. - Guilty as charged, ma'am. Must like to suffer, I guess. What happened? I.e.d. I don't remember any of it. Lost our driver. You? R.p.g. I guess we're both lucky to be here then. Yes, we are. - You get some rest, lieutenant. - Yes, ma'am. Oh, uh, you didn't tell me about the sandwich. Wet or dry? Wet. Lots of peppers. Good morning. I'm Andrea Arnold, chair of the Muriel Spenser foundation. I want to welcome you to fort Marshall, our host for the award this year, and to thank Claudia Joy for sharing her lovely home. Of course. Over the next two days, we're going to be getting to know each other quite well through a series of seminars, meals and educational forums, which is exactly what Muriel Spenser had in mind when she and general Jonathan Spenser created their foundation in 1991... To honor and encourage military spouses who exemplify extraordinary service on the home front. We all know that when a soldier makes a commitment to serve this country, so does that soldier's family, and no one does that better than the six of you. In recognition, each nominee will receive a Grant to further your volunteer work at home. Additionally, our award winner will receive a travel Grant to represent the foundation across the country. I'll send you postcards. Welcome back. So do you sprechen any Deutsch now? The only language I speak right now is stress. How backed up are we? Oh, you don't want to know. I kept the schedule light today. Canceled your 10:00, you have an 11:00 group... Right. And a few messages. - Dankeschön. - Bitteschön. It's good to see you again, brother. - How'd you get in? - I used my old key, let myself in before dawn. - Guess I owe you an explanation. - You're damn right you do. You ran out on me without a word. The next thing I know, the FBI's banging on my door saying you blew up a building. 30 years ago, I was at Berkeley... Young, angry... And I fell in with this radical group. And when they started talking about violence, man, I walked. So what about that federal building in Oakland? That was a few months later. Thank God no one got hurt. One of the bombers copped a plea and said I was in on it. Never mind I wasn't even in the city when the bomb went off. So you ran. Hell, yeah, I ran. - Even though you were innocent? - Come on, Burton. A young black man accused of blowing stuff up? There was no way I was gonna get a fair trial. But you had an alibi. Knowing that and proving it are two different things. I didn't like the odds. I built a new identity. I built a new life. So what are you doing here? The road is a lot harder than it was 30 years ago, man. You need money. Yeah. The FBI was here. Do you get that? If I help you, I'm committing a felony. Hey, look, man, if you're innocent, just turn yourself in. Let the system work for you. What damn world do you live in, man? I don't need a civics lesson. The fact is, you owe me money. Owe you? How do you figure that? I built this practice, brother. I signed it all over to you before I left. This building alone... how much do you think it's worth today? All I'm asking for is $5,000... Cash. That way there's no paper trail, nothing leading back to you. And when you show up again next month, how much then? Won't be a next month. I give you my word, man. We're talking about lessons we've learned as leaders. Anyone else care to comment? Well, last year I was diagnosed with diabetes. Uh, I didn't handle it very well. Actually, I tried to hide it. What my friends helped me realize was that I could turn my situation into an asset by talking about it and raising awareness. So I guess what I've discovered is that being a leader can mean sharing your frailties as well as your strengths. Very good. Very touching, Claudia Joy. What about you, Lenore? What have you learned as a leader? Well, to me, I guess it's all about courage. Having the strength to stand behind what you believe in. In Washington, I butt heads with the bureaucracy all the time on behalf of army families... Like little 9-year-old Emily Smith. Hmm. She's undergoing corrective surgery for a congenital spinal defect because I made the government live up to its responsibilities to our soldiers' children. Good for you, Lenore. The nominees will be wearing these, so we need to replace all the batteries. Okay. Got it. How do you open these? Trevor is a saint for taking Katie and Lucas, too. Well, don't worry about Trevor. He was really stoked about it. Yeah. Four kids... he's not gonna know what hit him. He loves it. Any word from Chase? Uh... No. He's, um, got survival training or something this week. So he's off the radar. Um, do you have any more batteries? Nice shot, Finn! Are those your children? Uh, two of 'em... the... the blond and the... and the glasses. And I got another one on the way. Oh, congratulations! Thank you. How old is this precious thing? She is almost a year. Hi, princess. Hi. That's her favorite, and we got it right here. - Really? - Yeah, a few weeks ago. - She loves it. - Yeah? She is so beautiful. Hi. Do you like this? Hey, dad. Watch this! What's he doing? He's playing with that stupid baby. My friend Natalie... Her parents just got this new baby. And now she gets stuck with her grandparents all the time. And her grandpa has hair coming out of his nose. - Gross. - Yeah. Thanks. Hey, kiddo. So did you pick out a movie we're gonna see yet? Yeah, about that. Um, I totally forgot that there's this party at lan's tonight, and I told this new girl at school I'd take her. Can we do the movie tomorrow night? Well, we have the Spenser awards tomorrow. Right. I forgot. Don't worry about it. We'll do it another time. - Are you sure? - Yeah. Okay. Thanks, dad. - You're the best. - Okay. See you. - Hey, guys, guess what I just got? - What? We're too big for toys like that. Yeah, I know. This is for the new baby. Come on, let's go to the car. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9... $5,000. - May I have an envelope, please? - Of course, sir. Thank you. Have a nice day, sir. Thanks, brother. - So I guess this is it. - Guess so. Hey, I know this wasn't easy. I really appreciate it. And it makes me feel good knowing you're carrying on the work here at piedmont place. I'd like to think that maybe one day we can be friends again. I'll see you. FBI! Hands, Price! Get on the ground! Now! Get on your knees! Now! You're under arrest. Down! Get down! Sorry, ma'am. Nights are hard. I know. Thank you. I heal for the honey I just can't help but think about stuff, Like how I had it all planned... Finish my tour, Get my m.B.A., Meet a guy. That can still happen. You have your whole life ahead of you, lieutenant. You mean half a life, ma'am. Who's gonna want me now? The right man will see you For the exceptional woman that you are. And he'll be a lucky guy. ♪ Poised... ♪ I'll nerve be able to pick up my own baby. I'm sorry, ma'am. You have nothing to apologize for. Do you think you could stay a while? Sure. - What happened to your date? - Stood me up. What? She had a party to go to. How was your dinner? It was lovely. I'm having the best time, Michael. These people are fantastic... Really inspirational. Lenore Baker Ludwig? Okay, most of them are inspirational. But not even she can spoil this. I'm glad to hear it. Coming upstairs? In a bit. When does the party start? - It's started. - Really? Kind of lame, isn't it? Know how we did it at camp Darby? All right! Come on. Have some fun. I told you, I don't drink. What fun is that? I'm serious. Uh, yeah, that's real obvious. Well, I didn't bring you here to watch you get trashed. So watch something else. Like champagne hey, babe. Long night? Yeah, but who's complaining? The hump is back. We're up 60%. That's awesome. Can I get a kiss? Can I get a kiss? Good day with the kids? It was great. We went to the park, the movies, had a couple of burritos. - What are you looking for? - I want to show you something. What? Ooh. Uh, I got this stuffed monkey for the baby, and I swore I left it right... Here. Does the monkey have red on its hat? Did the boys know you got this? I showed it to 'em at the park. Did you tell 'em it was for the new baby? Yeah, and they seemed good with it. Oh, man. Well, babe, It looks like we've got major jealousy going on here. All right. I'm gonna go talk to 'em. No, no, no, no. Let's both talk to them together, And not now, 'cause they're asleep. Okay? Okay. Ooh. Hello? Mrs. Sherwood? Emmalin? Honey, what's wrong? This girl drank too much at a party. I think she's in real trouble. I told her to stop chugging. Is she conscious? Um... No. I-I mean maybe. I don't know. Okay, honey. Slow down. Take a breath. Where are you? Um, I'm at park hill, near the flight line. You're not far from Mercer. You'll get there faster if you don't wait for an ambulance. Do you have a car? Yes. Have you been drinking? No. Good. Can you get this girl in the car? I need you to help me get her in the car. Look, my parents will freak if they find out about this. Don't you bail on me. Okay. Emmalin? Yeah. Yeah, there's somebody here to help. Good. Go straight to the emergency room. I'll meet you there. Come on. Okay. Put him in there. He says they weren't sure... She's out of danger. Oh, thank God. I thought she was gonna die. Oh, she's on an I. V., and they're hydrating her, But she's gonna be okay. Okay. Are you okay? Mm. It's time to call your folks. Do I have to? You know you do. Honey, you didn't do anything wrong. Hmm. Okay? What were you doing at a drinking party? It wasn't a drinking party. Then how did this girl get alcohol poisoning? She snuck in a bottle. But I wasn't drinking. I swear. We know. We had this discussion after my promotion, emmalin... How you are not to be anyplace where drinking is going on, How we are all being held to a higher standard. Now am I making this up? No. Michael, she might have saved that girl's life. I recognize that. Once the situation got out of control, She acted responsibly, and I am proud of that. What bothers me is how you put yourself In that situation in the first place. I expect more from you. Dad, Maya is the new girl on post. I was trying to be nice. Perhaps this will teach you to exercise better judgment When choosing friends. You're grounded for a month. What? Michael... That's it. Lieutenant colonel Burton. How's life treating you, Joan? Well, general. And yourself? No complaints. My goddaughter's getting more beautiful every day. Ah. Glad to hear it. I understand recovery's going well. Yes, sir. Looking forward to rejoining my unit. Joan... General Ormond just called. He needs an 0-5 for an important tasking At camp endeavor, Iraq... Provincial reconstruction team. Sir? They're rebuilding schools, And it hasn't been going well. So he wants to send the best available leader. I recommended you. Thank you, sir. He's also detaching sergeant first class Larson To assist you. This is a temporary assignment, But it's an important one. It's a high-priority mission, Joan. Hearts and minds... That's the goal here. I appreciate the recommendation. Listen, I know you want to get back in the fight, And you will. But right now, this is where the army needs you. Yes, sir. I won't let you down. I know you won't. All the way. Airborne, sir. You'll each have ten minutes for your individual presentations, Which will be your opportunity to talk about The work you do in your communities. Let's take five before we get a group photo. Claudia Joy... How is emmalin? I just heard. Poor dear. How's she doing? Emmalin's fine, thank you. Really? I heard she was taken to the emergency room last night... Something about alcohol poisoning. You're misinformed, Lenore. My daughter doesn't drink. Of course. No teenager ever drinks. Emmalin was at a party last night Where another girl drank too much and passed out. Emmalin drove her to the hospital. It must be so difficult raising girls these days, What with all these wild parties going on, huh? Actually, it's not so difficult When you raise your children to behave responsibly. Excuse me. Mm-hmm. Ohh! The nerve of that woman. Mm. I mean, she has been nothing but 9 miles of bad road Since, like, forever. I know. Seriously. Well, you have to fight back, Claudia Joy. You can't just take it all the time. You have to show her where you stand. I appreciate it, Roxy, But I need to handle Lenore my way. She's right, Rox. Oh, please. I have had it up to here with this high road business. Where I come from, the low road is what gets the job done. Quick little head butt between the eyes... pow! Okay, pregnancy has got your hormones all out of whack. Lenore is the wife of a 4-star. 4-star, 8-star, who cares? The higher a monkey climbs, the more it shows its ass. Lenore. A word? Of course. I'll say this once. Involve my family again in your personal grudge with me, And you'll regret it. That's not a threat. It's a fact. How'd you sleep, lieutenant? Better, ma'am. Thank you. You're shipping out to Walter Reed today. I wanted to wish you luck. Thank you, ma'am. I understand your orders came through. Yes. I've been temporarily reassigned To a provincial reconstruction team. Well, that's a damn shame, If you don't mind my saying so, ma'am. You deserve to be back with our unit. Major Ogden? We're ready for you. Well, if you fine ladies will excuse me, I've gotta get ready to ship out. See ya. You're not happy with your reassignment To a p.R.T., ma'am? Mm, it'll be fine. Though I must say, rebuilding schools Isn't exactly what I had in mind when returning to theater. A couple of months ago, This Iraqi woman came up to the wire. She had her 6-year-old daughter with her. She wanted to thank us For rebuilding the school in her village. She said she thought her little girl Was never going to get an education. The whole time I was in Iraq, I don't remember anyone thanking a soldier For neutralizing a hostile neighborhood Or Manning a checkpoint. But that woman was thanking us. You know, I'm no politician, ma'am, But that is what winning the war means to me... The look in that woman's eyes. And if that's what I lost my arm for, I'm good with it. The baskets for babies program not only provides toys And health products for new mothers, But thorough instruction on postnatal care And an introduction to health services on post. Since the jobs on the run program began, We've taught over a hundred young army spouses How to start their own businesses... Home businesses that they can take with them on the road When their soldiers are transferred. With the gala luncheon and the silent auction, We were able to raise the entire amount needed To refurbish Danville hall. Since then, it has housed numerous young people From other countries to promote understanding, Tolerance and goodwill. Bringing Haneen into our lives gave the war a human face. Her entire family had been killed Because her father and brother were translators. Since her visit, the F.R.G.'s beyond words program Has spread to a dozen posts across the country. Together, we've raised over $200,000 To help translators and their families Reach safe haven outside of Iraq. Our hope is that soon they'll be able to return to their homes In a country blessed with peace and Democratic rule. Thank you. Thank you again to all six of our deserving nominees. You truly are the face of heroism at home. We're gonna take a 5-minute break To allow the committee to confer one final time, And then we will present this year's Spenser award recipient. Thank you. Very impressive. Makes you proud of what we're doing here. Ohh. Are you still thinking about Price? Look, you did the only thing you could do. He trusted me. He was my friend. No, a friend doesn't put you in a position like that. Roland, if you'd given him the money and the FBI found out, They would put you in prison. Your first obligation is to your family. Thank you. Nice job. Thank you. Thanks. You killed 'em. We'll see. Thanks. Um, excuse me? So nice to see the worker bees helping the queen. Um, may I have your... Claudia Joy pretends to be such a saint, But don't kid yourself, honey. Yeah. Can I just get... Under the skin, she and I are exactly the same. I don't think so. Of course you don't, Because Claudia Joy is a master manipulator. How would I put Mic five out to the house? You just push this fader. Think I'll take a walk. I have watched her for years, And she just keeps getting better and better at the game. I do have to hand it to Claudia Joy, though... Playing the diabetes card... Oops. In front of the committee the other day... That was genius. Honestly, I wish I'd thought of it. Rope in the sympathy vote. Brilliant. Well, I don't think it's enough to counter all the points I've piled up in Washington. That's where all the important decisions are made With the Muriel Spenser foundation And everything else that matters. It's all who you know, honey, and I know 'em all. We're ready for the awards presentation. Excuse me, won't you? Ohh. Here. What's going on? How long has this been on? Ahem. Once again, we'd like to thank all of our nominees. And after much deliberation, it is with great pleasure That we present this year's Muriel Spenser award to... Claudia Joy holden. Oh! Thank you. Congratulations. Thank you. You're welcome. Uh, thank you so much. Uh, along with my fellow nominees, I'd like to thank the foundation for supporting the families Behind our fighting men and women. The best part of the past two days Has been the opportunity to meet so many wonderful people Who remind me that the army truly is a family itself. Whether in uniform or out, We all have a role to play in our country's future. That's the message I hope to convey In receiving this very special honor. Thank you. Ah. Thanks. I told you so. Oh, thank you. Claudia Joy? Excuse me. Okay oh, what a great day. Yep. It's always nice when the good guys win. Yeah. Yeah, I just wonder, though, How did Lenore's microphone get left on like that? I don't know. Must have been an accident. Mom? Hey, congratulations. You totally deserve it. Thanks, honey. Mm-hmm. I'm so proud of you. Emmalin, would you care to join your mother and me For a celebratory dinner? I've got homework. Thanks. I asked. Mm-hmm. I have to get my purse. All right. Lenore. Congratulations, Claudia Joy. Looks like you win it all... Again. This was never about winners and losers. Noble to the end. How endearing. You know, Lenore, with all you've accomplished, I honestly don't understand How you can be such a miserable person. Excuse me? Only someone intensely unhappy Could be so petty and vindictive. It's not enough for you to succeed. Others have to fail. I don't get it. What could you possibly want that you don't already have? Prestige? A successful husband? Friends? Friends? I don't have friends. I have followers. They either fear me or want something from me. You have friends. Well, you know why, Lenore? It's no great secret. I don't expect anything other than friendship in return. It's not a political calculation to me. It's really simple. To have a friend, you need to be one first. Thank you for that. I'll have to have it embroidered on a pillow someday... Right next to my girl scout handbook. Good-bye, Claudia Joy. Wow. Just wanted to take a look at the Judas who turned me in. You put me in an impossible situation. Yeah, I think you said that right before you called the FBI. Look, there was no happy ending here, Price. You were either gonna end up caught, killed Or living like a hunted animal for the rest of your life. Oh, so you did this for me? Thank you, brother. That's real considerate of you. What's that? That's a second mortgage on piedmont place. I put all the proceeds into a defense fund. You'll have the best legal team available. So am I supposed to be grateful? What gives you the right to roll the dice with my life? You rolled 'em with mine. I'm not quitting on you, Price. Major. Now you watch those jokes on the plane. Yes, ma'am. Thank you... for everything, ma'am. What's this? It's your in-flight meal. No. Well, it's definitely not from Chicago, But I'm pretty sure it is beef. And they threw in some peppers and gravy, Though I can't vouch for German gravy. Good luck with your recovery. Thank you, ma'am. And I'd love to hear about that school of yours. Count on it. I'm gonna build the best school Iraq has ever seen. Now both of you, stay safe. Either of you boys want to tell us about this? T.J. Did it. You were there, too. I told you not to. No, you didn't. All your mom and I want to know is why. You never asked us if we wanted a new baby. Yeah. What? Go ahead, t.J. You're gonna love the new baby more than us Because it's really yours and we're not. Buddy, is that what you think? It's true. No. No, it's not. It isn't? No. We saw you at the park playing with that baby. Look, guys... Maybe I wasn't there when you were born, But for me, You two are mine. And you're always gonna be mine. No matter what, okay? Okay. See, it doesn't matter If somebody is your birth parent or not. All that matters is that they love you. And your dad and I love you so very much. And you need to know That there's a lot of love inside every person. It's just not something that gets used up And then there's no more. When this new baby comes, there is gonna be Just so much more love in this house. You mean like when we got lucky? Yeah, like when we got lucky. Can I come in? Why is dad being such a hard-ass? Didn't he say he was proud of how you handled the situation? In between all the stuff about how dumb I was To get myself in a spot like that to begin with. Like your father said, he expects a lot from you. I think your dad was hurt When you broke that date with him. It was just burgers and a movie. Mm. It was a lot more than that to him. Your dad's just beginning to realize That all that time he was away with the army While you were growing up... He's not getting that back. I guess I blew it, huh? Dad, can I talk to you? Come in. I'm sorry. I made a bad call, And I'm really sorry. Burgers and a movie with my dad Would've been way better than that stupid party. Anything with you would've been. I hope we can try it again sometime. Apology accepted. And maybe... I overreacted a little. Hmm. Am I still grounded? Make it a week, and a day off for time served. Okay. So... About our dinner... You got your schedule? Right here. I got mine. Go ahead. Uh... How's the 19th looking for you? Um... A hail and farewell dinner. Hmm. What about the 20th? Mm... Uh... Hockey game. 26th? I'm good. Mm, it's a date. Okay. I still get to pick the movie, though. And I still get to groan.
