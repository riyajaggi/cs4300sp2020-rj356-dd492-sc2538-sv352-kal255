 Army Wives (2007–2013): Season 5, Episode 2 - Command Presence - full transcript 
 Trevor, still in Afghanistan, is furious to hear all the base knows that Roxy invited Finn's father to sleep in their house and failed to keep T.J. in line, who ends up incurring a $500 fine for shoplifting at a base board. That also prevented the last gang girl from attending Claudia Joy's law school graduation, but professor Chandler invites her to a celebratory dinner and offers her a perfect, part-time job. Chase is back, having opted for an instructor job over his Delta career, so Pamela declines the Atlanta PD offer. Mother-in-law to be Denise eats humble pie after the baby survives only because Tanya observed more carefully.

 Previously on "Army Wives"... Garrison commander and a promotion. It's probably best not to make any plans right now. What do you mean? I don't think the timing is right for a baby. - Oh, my God. - Who is that? That's Finn's dad. Get out! Whoa, whoa, whoa. What did you just say? Why is he here? Do not sass me. This is Whit. He's my friend.

 Like the friends you used to have before dad? Thanks for letting me come. Drive safe. Trust me. It's just colic. I'm just saying, maybe it's worth a trip to the doctor. What you're saying is that I don't know how to take care of my own child. I'm gonna go. Don't go back with your ex... And don't take that job. Stay here in Charleston with me. Oh, baby, you're burning up. Claudia Joy, there's something wrong with Molly. Can you meet me at the emergency room? Of course. I'm on my way.

 Okay. I'm so sorry, baby. Heartbeat's tachy. Pulse ox 90. She's pale and pasty with a sunken anterior fontanel. Urine is minimal and dark. She needs fluid resuscitation. Normal saline bolus at 100 cc's total. I don't understand. Why is she so dehydrated? - Do you breastfeed? - Every three hours. Get a Chem panel, a CBC and cultures. Molly have any, uh, diarrhea recently? No. Normal amount of wet diapers? Actually, they were pretty dry today. Any projectile vomiting? No, no, just, um, spittiness. I thought it was colic. I can't get a flash. We'll put in a central line. Let ultrasound know that we're coming up - and reserve the O.R. on standby. - Don't worry, sweetie. Mommy's here. Mrs. Sherwood, I'm sorry, but you're gonna have to wait outside. Ultrasound's ready for us. Good. Lidocaine. What's taking them so long? I'm sure they're just being thorough. How is she? Well, the ultrasound confirmed what we suspected. Uh, Molly has Pyloric Stenosis. - What's that? - It's a blockage between the stomach and the small intestine. - I thought it was colic. - It's often confused with colic. - Yeah, still, I-I should've... - Is it serious? When the blockage becomes complete. Fortunately, Mrs. Sherwood caught it in time. Well, good. Thank God for that, right? Can I see her? We're still correcting her fluids and electrolytes. Uh, once that's done, she'll need surgery. Surgery... It's routine. It's about a 20-minute procedure. Uh, we'll operate in the morning. We need your consent. T.J., Finn, get a move on. Hup-to. I'm ready. Good. Where's your brother? T.J.! We're having a pizza party at school today. I know, I know. Here is your $5. - Yes! - Do not lose it, okay? Okay. Hey, where you going, mister? - You said I could ride my bike to school. - Without your helmet? - Helmets are dorky. - No helmet, no bike ride. Mom. T.J., don't start with me. You know the rules. Let's go. Fine. Let's go. The Kretchmer file and the "Times" article you were looking for. Ah, thanks, Patty. Oh, and I'll be leaving at noon for colonel Burton's... Change-of-command ceremony. I'm all over it. All right. I called Mercer, and Dr. Lawlor will cover your 1:00, and Dr. Mead has your 2:00 group. - How would I get along without you? - You wouldn't. So this promotion to Garrison commander... - Yeah. - It's a big deal, huh? Oh, yeah. Joan's in charge of all the day-to-day stuff on Post. I got a feeling her life's gonna change in a major way. - Well, what about yours? - Me? Just the husband, Patty, flying under the radar like always. - Yeah, right. - Right. Okay, let's get started. We begin with a small incision near the umbilicus. Here you go. Thanks. Okay. Were you able to reach Frank? Yeah. I told him I'd call him again when Molly's out of surgery. Right. How did I miss it? Denise, you heard what the doctor said. Pyloric Stenosis is easily confused with colic. I'm a trained nurse, Claudia Joy, a paramedic. And a mother who's already raised a colicky baby. Of course you're gonna think it's the same thing with Molly. - Anyone would. - Tanya didn't. She tried to tell me something was wrong, and I... I snapped at her. She left the house in tears. Everything went as expected. Molly's doing fine. She's in recovery now. We're gonna keep her another day for observation. Barring any complications, you should be able - to take her home tomorrow. - Thank you. Thank you so much. Of course. Hey, Boone. Hey, Moran. Hello? You still there? Yeah. Uh, what's up? Uh, I've got tomorrow's schedule in front of me. Sawicki's out, so you're taking Sector Five, not Seven. Okay. Great. Yeah, I just wanted to give you a heads-up. Um... right. Thanks. Yeah. I'm, uh, working the same shift. Okay. So I was thinking, uh, maybe you want to grab some drinks after work? Let me guess. Happy hour at Taco Boy? You got something against Taco Boy? No, it's just that their margaritas make people do strange things. Yeah. So is that a yes or a no? I don't know. Uh, maybe. Come on, Moran. No more maybes. Yes or no? Up or down? Salt or no salt? Moran? Okay. Yes. And no salt. Okay. Hasta mañana. Hasta mañana. Hey, Red. Chase! You're back! He just showed up outta nowhere? Yeah, and scared the crap outta me. You think he heard you talking to Boone? No, definitely not, but it was written all over my face. What? I don't know. Um, embarrassment, guilt? You didn't do anything wrong. You were talking on the phone. And Chase is your ex-husband. I know, I know, but still, it felt like he had caught us between the sheets or something. Really? Is there something you're not telling me? No. Chase shoulda called first, - let you know he was back. - Yeah, but that's not his style. Did you tell him about the job offer? Yeah, I managed to squeak that part out. And? And I told him I haven't made any decisions about Atlanta or anything else. And, you know, I know Chase said that he'd quit Delta if I came back to him, but... But? But Chase loves Delta. So what if he gives it up, and six months later, figures out he made a big mistake and blames me? Hey, ladies. Hi. Thanks for coming. I know Joan really appreciates it. Of course. Chase is back. Really? What'd you tell him? Oh, come on. Not you, too. - Hi, everybody. - Hey. Hey, Claudia Joy. Where's Denise? She told me you guys were coming together. Oh, well, Denise can't make it. Everything's fine, but she's at Mercer. - What? - What happened? There was a little scare with Molly last night. Hello. Hey, Tanya. It's Denise. Oh, hi. Hope I'm not interrupting anything. No, I'm just packing. Uh, Tanya, I'm calling from Mercer hospital. Why? What happened? Well, you were right about Molly. She was sick. She had Pyloric Stenosis. Oh, my God. How is she? Well, she's perfectly healthy now, thanks to you. Well, I-I didn't do anything. Yes, you did. But I wouldn't listen. I was being stubborn. I'm sorry. All that matters is that Molly is okay. Would you come to the hospital? I'd like you to see her. Please. Mrs. holden, honored guests and friends, soldiers, and army civilians of Fort Marshall, it is my privilege to continue the work of Colonel Tate. All policies and procedures will remain in effect. I wouldn't be standing here today if not for the outstanding soldiers I have served with during my proud career in the United States Army. Without them, none of this would've been possible. I particularly would like to thank my husband, Dr. Roland Burton. He has sacrificed beyond measure to help me reach this day. My husband and my daughter give me the strength and the reason to carry on. And I can never thank them enough. Hey. Hey. Thanks for coming. Of course. Hey there, pumpkin. Are you feeling better? Mm-hmm. For the baby. Oh, you didn't have to. I saw it at the P.X. And I couldn't resist. Oh, it's adorable. Thanks. Here. Hey. Let's try this one on, huh? Oh, yeah. She likes it. Good. Hi. Hi. Tanya... It's okay. No, it's not. You came for a friendly visit, and I was awful. No, you weren't. Oh, yes, I was. Okay, a little. It's just that Jeremy is... He was my first baby and... whew. I get it. Really. I wish you and I could start over somehow. We have. Surprise. Hi. Sorry. I couldn't keep them away. Aw. Hi. Hi. Mwah. Mwah. Hey, everyone. This is Tanya Gabriel... Jeremy's fiancée. Hi. Hey, Tanya. And this is Claudia Joy, Pamela, Roxy, Roland. Hi. Don't worry. You'll get used to us. Yeah, and you don't really have a choice, so... - How you doin', Denise? - Great. Yeah, how was Joan's ceremony? It was terrific. Oh, my God. I just realized, I won't be able to make it to your graduation tomorrow. Oh, don't worry. - Oh, yeah, and I have to work. - Oh, Claudia Joy, me, too. I know you're all busy. Don't worry. - Well, hell, I'll be there. - Thanks, Roxy. - Sure. - You're graduating? Damn straight. Claudia Joy Holden - for the defense. - I'm getting my law degree. Wow. Congratulations. Well, thank you. It's a midyear ceremony, so there's not a lot of pomp and circumstance. Oh, she's being modest. She's at the top of her class. Oh, excuse me. Sorry. Hello. Yes, this is Mrs. LeBlanc. W... that cannot be right. As I explained on the phone, ma'am, your son was caught shoplifting an mp3 player from the P.X. - this afternoon. - You sure it was him? Your son was photographed by video surveillance and the player was found in his possession. You stole an mp3 player? Thank you, officers, and you can be sure that he will be properly punished for this. Well, that's your discretion, ma'am, but you and your son are to report to the juvenile discipline review board - tomorrow at 1300 hours. - The what? The juvenile discipline review board. They handle offenses like this on Post. And I'm guessing I don't have a choice in that. No, ma'am. Have a good day. Inside. What in the world is going on, T.J.? I don't know. Look at me when I am talking to you. Where did you get the idea that it is okay to take something that does not belong to you? I am so mad at you right now, I don't even know what to say. Is this the first time you stole something? Yes. So if I go into your room right now, I am not gonna find anything else? No. We'll see about that. Mom! That's my stuff. And it's in my house. That's mine. You steal and now you lie to me? Is this all of it? Answer me, T.J., right now, or I swear to God... Yes. - Let's go. - Where? Back to the P.X. You're gonna return this stuff and you're gonna tell 'em what you did. Mom! You move it. I have never been so embarrassed in my whole life. Having to tell the store manager at the P.X. That my son took all that stuff... I swear, Pamela. I just don't know what's going on with him anymore. Oh, I'm sorry, Rox. It's like he's turned into this little monster, and I just want my sweet, happy boy back. I'm starting to get some of that from Katie and Lucas, too. Yeah, but they're not shoplifting from the P.X. And you know what's weird? Most of the stuff he took, he hadn't even unwrapped it yet. - Figure that out. - Feeling guilty, maybe? - So why keep stealing? - I don't know. Kids do crazy things. Oh, shoot. What? Now I can't go to Claudia Joy's graduation tomorrow. I have to go to this discipline review punishment thing with T.J. Well, I'm sure she'll understand. - Well, what am I supposed to tell her? - The truth. Uh, no. I'm not telling Claudia Joy Holden that my son is a thief. - Roxy! - I'll just tell her that there's a field trip for one of the boys or something. Hey, mom. Um, hey, Roxy. Chase is here with the kids. So you hang in there, and I'll call you back later, okay? Okay. Thanks. - Dad took us to the pier. - Okay, bye. Fish and chips. We brought you some. - But Lucas ate all your chips. - I did not. Well, that's okay. I don't need any chips - if I want to keep fitting in my uniform. - Oh, you fit into it just fine. Can we watch TV? Uh, homework first. But... No buts. Go. Fine. So... Chase, if you want an answer, I don't have one yet. Pamela... and I know it's annoying, but I've got a lot to think about. Pamela, I have something to say. Okay. Sorry. I dropped my papers today. It'll take a month or so to process, but after that, I won't be a Delta operator anymore. I know I told you I was gonna wait for your answer, but while I was away this time, I got to thinking. I want to be near the kids, no matter what. So I requested a reassignment to instructor. Wow. No more missions. No more leaving in the middle of the night. No more worrying about where I am. Wow. You said that already. Are you sure about this? Yeah, I'm positive. Okay, time to turn off reading lights. Night, mom. Night, Finn. Night, T.J. Hey, babe. Oh, am I glad to talk to you. What the hell is going on there, Rox? - What? - I come back from patrol, and my platoon sergeant pulls me out of chow line and tells me T.J.'s stealing from the P.X. Yeah. Um... That's what I wanted to talk to you about. What the hell is going on? Hey, do not yell at me, Trevor. - Well, my son's stealing? - It's our son, and I don't know what's going on with him either, other than the fact that his father is 8,000 miles away. Oh, so this is my fault? I suppose this has nothing to do with the fact that you had some guy sleep over the other night? What?? I heard about it from three other guys, Roxy. Their wives told 'em his truck was still parked out in front of our house the next morning and that you kissed him good-bye. I did not kiss him. It... it's an old friend. Nothing happened. What old friend? Finn's dad. Whit. Finn's dad? I thought you said he was out of your life. He was. He is. He was just passing through. His daddy died and left him some money, and he wanted to give Finn some of it. Well, you didn't take it did you? It's for Finn's college fund. Damn it, Roxy. We don't need anybody's money. I can provide for our family. I know you can, babe. So... so you took his money then you had beers with him on our front porch with the whole neighborhood watching. I had two beers. And he had a couple more, so I let him sleep it off on the couch. You're unbelievable. You let an ex-boyfriend sleep in our house while I'm not there? On the couch. And he's not an ex-boyfriend. I already told you that. No, he's just the father of your son. And you really wonder why T.J.'s stealing from the P.X.? That is so unfair. It has absolutely nothing to do with that. How could you... I can't even believe you could say that! What do you want me to say? I come back from patrol after busting my ass for five days to find out my wife is kissing some other dude on our porch. I told you that that is not what happened. Look, Trevor, I think we need to concentrate on what is really important here. Okay? You need to talk to T.J., because he will listen to you, and I can't play bad cop all the time. Fine. I'll try you tomorrow. I gotta go. Fine. Ugh! Ma'am, governor Haley's office called to confirm her attendance at tonight's reception. Excellent. Yes, ma'am. It'll be a good opportunity to bring up your green initiative for the Post. Good idea, sergeant major. I see we have the Juvenile Discipline Review Board today. Yes, ma'am. Last Tuesday of every month. Four cases today... Wilson, Cross, Tobias, and LeBlanc. LeBlanc? Toby Jack LeBlanc, ma'am. You familiar with the family? Yes, I am. Is that gonna be a problem? Not at all, sergeant major. What else do we have today? Let's see. We have a meeting with Colonel Reddick at 1100 hours. The Provost Marshal wants to present upgrade for the perimeter at 1600 hours. However, I suggest we move that... Excuse me. Thank you. All right. Claudia Joy. Congratulations. Thank you, Professor Chandler. You know, my class won't be the same without you. Oh, I bet you say that to all your students. No. Uh, I don't. Uh... you alone? Yes, Michael's, um, in Afghanistan and my friends were tied up. Well, you can't be alone on your graduation day. How about lunch? Oh, come on. You worked hard to get to this day. You d... you deserve a little celebration. You're right. Excellent. So... What are you in the mood for? So, uh, I take it you are studying for the bar? I am. South Carolina and New York. New York? Mm-hmm. Michael's being considered - for a position at West Point. - Oh, impressive. Also confidential. Understood. So... What about when you're done with the bar? I don't know. Have you considered applying for a clerkship? Working for a judge would make you very marketable. Oh, I would love to. But any judge would expect me to work full-time, and that's just, uh, it's not realistic with my duties at Fort Marshall. I see. And most law firms don't offer part-time work, so... Most. But... Not all. Would you consider working for me? Now that we've reviewed the charges against you, T.J., is there anything you'd like to say? I'm really sorry. I mean, I know stealing's wrong and I won't do it again. And he means that, too. T.J. Is not a problem, and I... Mrs. LeBlanc, please sit down. You're not permitted to speak at this proceeding. Sorry. He really is a good boy. T.J., the board appreciates your apology and hopes that your remorse is sincere. Nevertheless, criminal behavior cannot go unpunished. You are barred from the P.X. for six months. You will be issued a new I.D. Card with restrictions. You will also write a 500-word essay on the dangers of shoplifting to be delivered to this board in one week. Do you understand? Yes, ma'am. Additionally, to recover costs related to shoplifting, per Post Exchange regulation, I am imposing a $100 fee per shoplifted item... an mp3 player, two DVDs, a package of markers, and a model car. Wait a minute. That's $500. Please, Mrs. LeBlanc, sit down. But he returned all that stuff, and he also apologized to the store manager. We recognize the burden these fines may place on you, but they are mandated by policy. Well, you wouldn't have even known about those other items if I didn't make T.J. Bring them back. Mrs. LeBlanc, your presence here is a privilege. Just as it is a privilege for your family to have housing on Post. In the future, I recommend you control your son's behavior. Thank you for your time. Let's go. It was so unfair. Okay, all right, slow down. She fined me $500... - Right. - And humiliated me. Look, Joan was just doing her job. It's not personal. Not personal? She threatened to throw us off Post. I'm sure she didn't mean that. You weren't there. No, I wasn't. - So what do you want me to do? - I don't know. Talk to her. We returned everything, so why should we have to pay a fine on top of that? Look, Roxy, I'm sorry, but I'm not gonna tell my wife how to do her job. If you want, I could... I could talk to T.J. For you. No, thank you. I can handle my son. Well, I thought you just told me you were having problems. I'll handle it. Hey, look... I know this is rough. But Joan's job is to enforce Post regulations. I'm sure it was hard on her, too. Not as hard as it was on me. No. But the real problem here is T.J., isn't it? I guess. Trevor been any help? You don't want to know. Thank you. Sorry to bother you. Hey, Roxy. I'm here. Good news. They cleared Molly to go home today. Good. Tanya's gonna stay a few extra days and help out. Great. I'm so glad. Oh, me, too. How was graduation? It was fine. Professor Chandler was there. Mm-hmm. Took me to lunch. Mm. Nice. Hey. Big Professor taking out his star pupil. Ah. I guess. Oh, did you hear from Michael? No. Hmm. I'm sure he's busy. Yeah. Claudia Joy. Hmm? I have to admit, some flowers would've been nice... Or a card even. Mm. I know it's silly. It's not silly at all. Hello, Tom. Afternoon, Mrs. Holden. Your garbage disposal is back in business. And I fixed that leak in your guest bathroom. Good. You're a lifesaver. Not at all. Oh, uh, those came for you while I was here. Pretty. Yeah. You have a good day now. Thanks, Tom. You, too. Michael. Hello, beautiful. Hey. I just had a minute. I thought I'd try and catch you. - I'm glad you did. - I wanted to tell you, the list for West Point just got shorter, and I'm still on it. That's wonderful. I don't want to brag, but I really think I have a good shot at this. How was your day? It was good. Graduation was nice. Wait a minute. That was today? No. How did I screw that up? I had it down as next week. Oh, Claudia Joy, I am so sorry. - It's okay. - No, it's not. You're busy, Michael. You have a lot on your mind. That's no excuse after all the hard work you put in. - You know how proud I am of you? - I do. Oh, man. Michael, it's okay. Besides... I have some good news, too. I got a job offer today. What? You haven't even taken the Bar. I know. It's only part-time, and Professor Chandler says I can work around my responsibilities on Post. Chandler? You're taking a job with Grant Chandler? With his law firm. They do a lot of public interest law. I didn't say yes. I wanted to talk to you first. Right. Michael, it's a great opportunity. Associate-level work... there's no way I'd get an offer like this anywhere else. Well, you know I'm not wild about the guy. But whatever you decide, I'll support. Thank you. I gotta go. I love you. I love you, too. And I will make up for this. Forget about it, honey. Not a chance. So Chase is switching jobs. He's gonna be on Post now. Yeah. An instructor. And the Atlanta job is still open. Yep. And I am right here. Yeah. Have you made a decision, any decisions? ♪ Yeah, I'm gonna have the fish tacos. Funny, Moran. You know... Boone, you really blindsided me the other day. I guess I just had never thought of us... Like that. That's just what every guy wants to hear. I know. Sorry. Hey, if you need more time... I don't need more time. You sure? Yeah. I mean... Who am I kidding? Why didn't I just go for the Atlanta job right away? Because I'm still in love with Chase. ♪ Claudia Joy, have a seat. Uh, no, no, I-I can't stay long. First I wanted to thank you for the flowers. - They're beautiful. - A-a-and? Well, um... When I commit to something, I like to see it through to the end. But in this case, I know you're gonna be putting in a lot of time and resources, and... you're not sure how much longer you're gonna be in Charleston. Exactly. This is the Army, after all. And I don't want to shortchange you. Noted and appreciated. But I wouldn't have made the offer if I hadn't taken that into account. We'll get our money's worth out of you. Believe me. Yeah? You can count on it. Okay. I will. - Is that a yes? - It is. Welcome to Chandler, Arnoff & Drake. Thank you, Professor. Grant. Grant. Thank you. This is my third event for Joan in the past two days. There's a big difference between being a soldier's spouse and a commander's spouse. Seriously. Do you ever get tired of it, the responsibility? Sometimes. It's a constant balancing act between your needs, your spouse's needs, and the army's needs. As far as Uncle Sam's concerned, you're an extension of Joan's office. Right. It's not what I signed up for, Claudia Joy. Making small talk with dignitaries is not exactly my idea of a good time. Get used to it. Come on. Joan will start wondering why you're avoiding her. Well, she's with the Governor. Exactly, and that's why - you need to be right at her side. - Claudia Joy... come on, soldier. Colonel, sergeant major. Evening, Claudia Joy. Governor Haley, it's so good to see you again. It's my pleasure. Governor, this is my husband, Dr. Roland Burton. Evening, ma'am. Uh, Governor. - Nice to meet you, Dr. Burton. - Same here. I was just telling Roland how much we appreciate - your support of military families. - Thank you. Thank you. I know Joan's really looking forward to working with you on some environmental initiatives. Really? I'd love to hear about that. I was just getting there, but my husband is one step ahead of me. Well, it happens occasionally, but very occasionally. All right. Well, I'd love to talk about it. Devlin, you will set that up? I'll check the schedule. Hey, dad. What's going on with you? I messed up. Yeah. You messed up big-time. Yeah, I told everyone I'm sorry. Okay. So what are you gonna tell me? Do I have to remind you that your actions have consequences? No. And not just consequences for you, but for your mom, me, Finn, everyone. I know. I gotta say, T.J., I'm real disappointed in you. I expected a lot more. I need you to stay on the right path from now on. - You understand? - Yes. Yes, what? Yes, sir. Okay. Put your mom back on. Okay. Bye, dad. He wants to talk to you again. Okay. Go get ready for bed. - So? - So I hope I got through to him. Yeah, me, too. I can't take much more of this, Trevor. I don't know what's going on there, Rox, but whatever it is, it's gotta stop. Now. Really, Trevor, does it? Does it need to stop? Thank you so much for your support. Well, you're the one at home, so you're the one who's gotta keep it together. Yeah. Well, do you want to tell me how to do that? I thought that went well. Yeah. It's gonna take a little getting used to, being a commander's spouse. You did great. Thank you. Hey, Roxy came by to see me today. Oh? Yeah, she was pretty upset. Her son stole from the P.X. And had to face the consequences. Mm-hmm. I sure hope he learned his lesson. Me, too. But 500 bucks? Sounds kinda harsh. I agree, but it's Post policy. Roxy shouldn't have come to you with this. Ah, don't worry. I defended you. I don't need defending. Her son is the one who did something wrong. Okay. I understand. I hope so. As Garrison commander, I've got a lot of people watching my every move. As a woman, particularly as a woman of color, I've got to be better than good at this job. I have got to be outstanding. One hint of favoritism, one sign of weakness, my credibility is gone. I got it. Thank you. ♪ He was so cute when he was little. Mm. Yes, he was. I'm sorry we don't have a proper guest bedroom. We turned Jeremy's room into the nursery. Compared to Afghanistan, this is a five-star hotel. Aw. Well, I think you're all set. I'll see you in the morning. Good night. I'm so glad you're here. - Me, too. - Yeah. ♪ Like a silent wind blowing ♪ ♪ through the cracks in the walls ♪ ♪ of my room ♪ ♪ and my heart did sink ♪ ♪ and my eyes did shut ♪ ♪ and my mind got tangled up ♪ Well, I appreciate your confidence in me, captain.
