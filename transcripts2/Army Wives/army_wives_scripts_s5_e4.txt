Well, it's gonna take time. I know that's hard to believe right now. I'm supposed to start next month, get my B.A., go to Med school. The army was gonna pay for everything. Right. I don't know if I can do that now. I don't know how I feel about the Army anymore. Guess I should take this off, huh? No. Not until you're ready. When will that be? Trevor. Hey.

Could you be killed, too? And what'd you tell 'em? As little as possible. What did happen? We got into it. That's all. What does that mean? Um... we, uh... We came under fire, and, uh... We had to take this hill to avoid being flanked, and that's... That's when Jeremy got hit. So... You were with him. Yeah. Oh. Thank God you weren't hurt. I don't think God has much to do with it, Rox. Um... I was with some of the F.R.G. wives, putting some food together for Denise, and, uh, they said that because you're Jeremy's squad leader, that you might be escorting the body home for the funeral. Is that true? Uh... Well, they asked, but since Colonel Sherwood was already going, I said I'd stay in the field. Oh. Rox, my job is here with my men, and Jeremy was our first K.I.A. The guys really need me right now. Yeah, I get it. Just remember, um... We need you, too. I need you... Home and safe, okay? I know. Colonel Sherwood is escorting your son's body from Afghanistan through Ramstein, on to Dover Air Force Base, where the remains will receive final processing and preparation for the funeral. Colonel Sherwood will then continue on to escort the body to the local funeral home of your choice. If you like, we can provide transportation for you to meet your husband at Dover. Or would you prefer to meet at the funeral home? - Mrs. Sherwood? - I'm sorry. What? Um, she'll meet them here. Swinton's Funeral Home, on Calhoun. Mrs. Sherwood, I need to discuss with you your options for the disbursement of the Death Gratuity, which will be paid to you or whomever you designate within 72 hours. His sister. Jeremy wanted the money to go to his sister. Yes, I see that, uh, Specialist Sherwood designated Molly Sherwood as the beneficiary of his soldier's Group Life Insurance, but... the Death Gratuity is a separate matter. Can we discuss the money later? Yes, ma'am. The next matter is the disclosure form regarding the information requests from the Media... - Denise? - Advocacy groups or private individuals. I'm sorry. Can I just have a moment, please? I can come back later if you'd like, ma'am. No, I-it's fine. I'll be... I'll be right back. I'm okay. Oh, God. ♪ ♪ Oh. Oh. Frank, this is Molly. Hey, princess. Oh, D., she is just beautiful. Let me take her, Frank. Here you go, sweetheart. Frank, this is... this is Tanya. Colonel Sherwood. Hello, Tanya. Jeremy told me a lot about you. He spoke very highly of you, too, sir. Oh, please. Call me Frank. Sh... shall we? I'll wait here, okay? ♪ So this is it. I guess so. Well, good luck. I brought you something. It's a Unit coin. My C.O. in Iraq gave it to me. I'd like you to have it. Thank you. Thank you, Dr. Burton. Without your help... I wouldn't be deploying tomorrow. Hell, I might not even be here. Hey, don't you forget, man. You drove the car. I just helped to navigate. Hey, mom. Can I go to the funeral tomorrow? Um... I don't think that's... I want to. Jeremy was my friend, too. I don't know. Funerals can be... Hard to handle. I want to be there with you... You know, since dad can't be there. I thought you wouldn't want to be alone. Come here. I'd love you to be there. How do you pick? Well, if it's for the church program, I think we should use his official portrait. This was taken just after he made E4. He looks strong. You know, they said we can use as many as we want in the lobby. I... I think that'd be nice. Don't you? This is the day we brought him home from the hospital. Remember? Yeah, of course. Remember this? The red rocket? Lord, he loved that bike. Mm-hmm. It... It all went by so fast. ♪ ♪ ♪ At this time, Jeremy's friend, Emmalin Holden, will come forward to offer another remembrance. Uh, I don't remember a time in my life when I didn't know Jeremy. Um, our families met at Fort Carson when were little, and then we were stationed together again at Fort Bliss. Wherever we were, uh, Jeremy was always the same... Sweet... Funny... Kind of a goofball to tell you the truth. What I'll remember most about Jeremy is... That he loved his family more than anything in the world. And this being the army, he had a... a pretty large family. He was always looking out for me and Amanda. And I... will never forget how loud he cheered for me at my hockey games. One time, a ref saw him screaming, and he said... "That must be your brother." And I said, "Yeah, he is." I love you, Jeremy. Look after my sister. Thank you, Emmalin. Friends... Let us turn to the back of the program for a responsive reading. Lord, hold us in our loss and hear our prayers for Jeremy Sherwood, who lives beyond our touch, yet within your closeness. May those who loved him emerge from the pain of grief to find comfort in the memories of the time you shared together and gain strength from your grace to find peace and hope again. Amen. Amen. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry for your loss. ♪ Good-bye. ♪ ♪ I'm so glad Jeremy knew love while he was alive. Thank you. Thank you...
