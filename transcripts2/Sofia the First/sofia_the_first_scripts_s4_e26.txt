 Our old shop.  What are we doing here, Mom? Oh, you'll see. Wow! It's just  how we left it. Mm, almost. I made something for you. [angelic music plays] [gasps] -They're beautiful!  -Happy graduation, Sofia. -Thanks, Mom.  -Mmm. OK, now, you better change. We have to leave soon. What do you think? Oh, Sofia! You look so grown up! I can't believe this'll be  my last day of Royal Prep. I still can't believe  you went to Royal Prep. Or that I'm a queen! [sighs] We have come  a long way. [sighs] Oh, are you all right, Sofia? The other students chose me to give a speech at graduation. -Oh, that's great!  -I know. If I only knew what to say. After all these years,  what do you tell everyone  on such a big day? ¶ ¶ ¶ It's not that far  from our village  to the castle ¶ ¶ But it seems that I've come  such a long way ¶ ¶ At first I thought  I wasn't ready to be royal ¶ ¶ But I proved I belong  I proved I'm here to stay ¶ ¶ So when I stand  in front of all those  whom I care about ¶ ¶ I wanna rise and shine  but still there is  a little doubt ¶ ¶ I really wanna wow 'em ¶ ¶ But I'm not sure  just how I'm ¶ ¶ Gonna find  all the right things to say ¶ ¶ On such a big day ¶ ¶ I never thought  you would wind up  being a princess ¶ ¶ But I'm proud how very much  you have grown ¶ ¶ You may have started out  a young girl from the village ¶ ¶ But you proved you are strong  You proved it on your own ¶ ¶ So when you stand  in front of all those  whom you care about ¶ ¶ I know you'll rise and shine  Of that I haven't any doubt ¶ ¶ Just like the stars  above you ¶ ¶ Forever will I love you ¶ ¶ I'm sure  you'll discover the way ¶ ¶ On such a big day ¶ ¶ It's such a big day ¶ ¶ I must prepare myself  for when I am the queen ¶ ¶ And now I finally know  exactly what that means ¶ ¶ I'll need a good heart  to be a big success ¶ ¶ But first I must start  with the queenliest dress ¶ ¶ I wish that I could wear  my armor to the school ¶ ¶ Oh how I'd like  to show them all  my knightly moves ¶ ¶ I just have to wait  until the time is right ¶ ¶ When we celebrate  at the party tonight ¶ ¶ The party tonight ¶ ¶ I can't believe  you are really graduating ¶ ¶ I remember cradling you  in my arms ¶ ¶ It's time to go  we cannot keep ¶ ¶ The whole school waiting ¶ ¶ Ha! What would we  do without ¶ ¶ Our Baileywick alarm? ¶ ¶ Oh here she comes  the princess we have all  been waiting for ¶ ¶ On this most special day  let's show her what  we have in store ¶ ¶ There's nothin'  that can beat food ¶ ¶ To put you  in a sweet mood ¶ ¶ What a tasty way  to say, "Hooray!" ¶ - ¶ On such a big day ¶  -[birds tweeting] ¶ You know how much I love  your crisp pink apple tarts ¶ ¶ And so I thank you  from the bottom of my heart ¶ ¶ Remember Princess  you made rubies just for me ¶ [sighs] Sure. Well... ¶ In this tiara now ¶ ¶ They'll fit you to a T ¶ [sighs] It's beautiful! ¶ Ooh! ¶ ¶ Seeing all my friends  and royal family ¶ ¶ Amber, James,  oh, Rollie, dear ¶ ¶ Guess it means we'll soon  be on our way ¶ ¶ So happy everyone is here ¶ ¶ But as long as I  have all of you beside me ¶ ¶ Where were you hiding  that new dress ¶ ¶ I know I'll work it out ¶ ¶ I know I'll be Okay ¶ ¶ So as we go to honor  all those whom we care about ¶ ¶ For all  that you've achieved ¶ ¶ It's time  to give a cheer and shout ¶ ¶ Our proudest graduation ¶ ¶ We give congratulations ¶ ¶ Somehow I'll find  the right thing to say ¶ ¶ I'm sure you'll  discover the way ¶ [all]  ¶ Now let us be off and away ¶ ¶ On such a big day ¶ ¶ A big day ¶ ¶ Such a big day ¶ All right, everyone,  it's time to go. You don't want to be late  to your own graduation. Uh, I need to check  on something before we go. I'll be right back. [sighs] Sofia! You have  to come with us! Azurine spotted Prisma  on the Isle of Crystals. Every Protector  of the Mystic Isles has been summoned there to find her. That includes  Protectors in Training,  like you! Climb aboard  your trusty steed,  my Princess. Uh-- I can't go  to the Mystic Isles now. I'm about to graduate. "About to" means "not right this second." -Am I right?  -I guess. -Then grab your gear,  and get a move on!  -But-- If we let Prisma  get her hands on  the Wicked Nine, she'll transfer  all the power of those magical objects  to herself! Then she'll be unstoppable. [Amber] Sofia! Sofia, where are you? What's going on? I have to go  to the Mystic Isles. But everyone's waiting for you. Just tell them I'll meet them  at the graduation, Amber. Please. [sighs] OK.  But be careful. I will. Promise. Meet me upstairs. Climb aboard, my Princess! [grunts] -Let's go, Skye.  -Quick as a lick! Chrysta, why would Prisma  be on the Isle of Crystals if she's after the Wicked Nine? We locked them up  on the Isle of Protectors. What if it's a trick? What if Prisma is trying  to lure us all to the Isle of Crystals  so no one is guarding  the Wicked Nine? We left Garish behind to guard the Protectors' Vault, which has a totally  100% unbreakable lock. [sighs] But Prisma stole  my Necessi Key. You don't think that would work on the Vault, do you? I don't know. It might! We better check out your hunch, just in case! To the Isle of Protectors, Skye. Right away, my Princess! [heavy door closes] -[cat meows]  -Hmm? -[chuckles] Now, where  did you come from?  -[purring] I'm sorry, but there  are no cats allowed here. -[cawing]  -No birds, either. Scoot! [Garish]  Come on, now, both of you.  Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! -[bird cawing]  -Scram, you varmint!  [grunting] -Scoot! Ugh!  -[Chrysta] Garish! Behind you! -We can't let  Prisma get in there!  -Huh? What?! How did she  escape her cell? A diversion. It worked! Nice try, Princess. -No!  -You're too late! My transformation will begin! We have to get in there  and stop her! Open it up! We have liftoff! Orion! Vega!  You've been tricked! Prisma got into the Vault! -[keys jangling]  -Oh! [gasps] [grunting] Hurry! -Come on!  -[exclaims] I'm flying! We will bring together  the power of the villains who have come before you. [gasps] We can't let her  complete the spell! [Vor]  Release the Wicked Nine! Feel their power! Oh, I feel it! [grunts] [Garish]  Whoa-oa-oa! [both]  Garish! Chrysta, hurry!  Make a wind whip! [both grunt] [whip cracks] [both grunting] [Prisma] Finally! The power of the Wicked Nine is all mine! No one will be able  to stop me! Sofia! She's too strong! We have to hold on! [gasps] Sofia! My Enchantlet! Quick - grab on! We've almost got her! [strains] [gasps] Huh? Wha--? Wha-- wha-- what is this? What's happening? Oh, no! No, but-- No!  Wa-wa-wai-wai-wait! Wait! This isn't fair! [screams] [grunts] I think we broke the spell! [yelps] Ow! [panting] The locket! [grunts] No! You're not going anywhere,  Prisma. [groans] You! I'll take that Necessi Key.  Good job, Sofia! You caught her just in time! -Where is Prisma?  -Right there! My trainee stopped her. Again. Well done, Sofia! We'll take it from here. Come on, you. Garish, take Prisma  to the tower. -Right away, Vega.  -Argh, so close!  I could feel it! Here. This is yours. And this is yours. The locket is destroyed Perhaps the spirit of Vor is gone forever. What do you mean,  the spirit of Vor? Eons ago, an evil being named Vor used the power  of her magic ring to spread her evil  across our worlds. The Protectors defeated her.  But Vor's spirit could not  be extinguished. So it was imprisoned  in that locket. But her magic ring was lost. Some say it was broken up, and the pieces placed  inside the Wicked Nine. That's why Prisma wanted them! She wanted all that power  for herself. But if she had completed  that spell, she might've released  the spirit of Vor  from the locket. Thankfully, you prevented that from happening. Well done, trainee. Thanks, Mr. Orion.  But if it's OK with you, I really have to go now. -Of course.  -Happy graduation! [bells chiming] It's time to begin, everyone.  Please take your seats. [both sigh] Thanks for inviting us,  Your Majesty. -Where's Sofia?  -That is a good question. [whispers] Where's Sofia? She's on her way! I hope. Welcome! -Parents...  -Teachers... And this year's  graduating class. [light applause] [Fauna] Oh, my. How you all have blossomed into such fine princes and princesses. Thanks, Skye. Desmond? Oh. Hi, Sofia. What are you doing back here? It looks like  they've started already. I know. If I'd realized being the best student meant I'd have to get up and speak in front of everyone, I would've failed more tests. At least you prepared  a speech. I still don't know  what I'm going to say. [Fauna] And I am proud to introduce our valedictorian, [laughs] ...Prince Desmond! -[light applause]  -Here! You can give my speech. -I can't do that.  -Well, I'm not going up there. [Fauna clears throat] Prince Desmond! -I know!  -[Desmond exclaims] Here we are, Miss Fauna! [applause continues] [sighs] We're going to give  our speech together! Oh, no! Uh, did you happen to memorize your speech? -Nope.  -Okay. [clears throat] When I first came  to Royal Prep, I really didn't know anything  about being royal. I felt like I had  a lot of catching up to do. But I had some help.  From my brother, James. -[light applause]  -From Vivian, and Clio... -[Clio gasps]  -[Sofia] Hildegard... -Zandar, Jin...  -[Jin giggles] June, Maya, Khalid,  Desmond... Zooey, Kari, Hugo... Penelope, and Mike. [sighs] And especially...  my sister, Amber. [gasps] I had help, too.  Sofia helped me  overcome all my fears. Even my fear of speaking  in front of lots of people. The teachers taught us  how to be better rulers, but we taught each other  how to be better people. So, as we all prepare  to go off to other schools, let's take a moment to remember how we showed each other what being royal  is truly all about. ¶ At Royal Prep  step by step ¶ ¶ We gained wisdom and pep ¶ ¶ Heeded the call  and we're all ¶ ¶ We could be ¶ ¶ Every task, every test ¶ ¶ We gave it our best ¶ ¶ And they did the rest ¶ - ¶ You see ¶  -[light applause] ¶ We won't forget our motto ¶ ¶ To which we'll be true ¶ ¶ "Rule over others as you'd ¶ ¶ Have them rule over you" ¶ ¶ We're royal all the way ¶ ¶ All the way ¶ ¶ At good old R.P.A. ¶ ¶ R.P.A. ¶ ¶ It's step by step ¶ ¶ With wisdom, grace, and pep ¶ ¶ At Royal Prep ¶ ¶ Here at Royal Prep ¶ [cheering and applause] [man]  Bravo! [applause continues] [caws] So, we had a bit  of a setback. [laughs] That was more  than a setback, Twitch. That presumptuous  little princess  foiled me again! -I failed.  -[Vor] You did not fail. -Huh?  -Huh? Who said that? I did. -Vor?  -Mm-hmm. Open your hand. My power is restored, and I am freed  from the locket. [gasps] So then you'll  give me the power I so desperately deserve? [laughs] No. I will give myself  the power I deserve. Say goodbye, Prisma. Goodbye? Why? Because. Now you  will become Vor. [gasps] Finally! -[squeaking]  -[cawing] You have a new master now,  my pets. And unlike your old masters, I know that the only way  to obtain what you want is to be truly, madly,  deeply evil. -So, get ready.  -[squeaks] Because it's time  to get wicked. Now that's what I'm  squawking about.  [caws] ¶ The world has never seen  someone as mean ¶ ¶ As yours truly ¶ ¶ I was villainously vile  and completely unruly ¶ ¶ But then  those pesky Protectors ¶ ¶ Caught up to me ¶ ¶ They locked me in that locket  and they threw away the key ¶ ¶ So I pandered to Prisma  and I offered her power ¶ ¶ I would say or do anything  to get out of that tower ¶ ¶ She thought she was winning  but I could not be stopped ¶ ¶ The greater of two evils  has come out on top ¶ ¶ Now I've got a new mission  that I must complete ¶ ¶ To bring out the worst  in everybody I meet ¶ ¶ I'll help them find  their inner evil ¶ ¶ By setting them straight ¶ ¶ Being vicious  and suspicious ¶ ¶ Is deliciously great ¶ ¶ So let's get wicked ¶ ¶ Let's do some bad today ¶ ¶ Get wicked  Put on an evil display ¶ ¶ Get wicked  The point that I'm making ¶ ¶ Is when you get wicked ¶ ¶ The world is yours ¶ - ¶ For the taking ¶  -[whinnies] [whinnies] I feel more wicked already! And I am just getting started! What is your plan,  Your Vileness? I have a whole menu planned. The first course is revenge against those who imprisoned me. And that precious  little princess who keeps getting in my way. We shall take her castle  and her kingdom. And then, for the main course, we shall wrap our claws  around the entire EverRealm. You are the master of my dreams! No! I am the master  of your nightmares! [all]  ¶ So let's get wicked ¶ ¶ Let's do some bad today ¶ ¶ Get wicked  Put on an evil display ¶ ¶ Get wicked  The point that we're making ¶ ¶ Is when you get wicked ¶ ¶ The world is yours ¶ ¶ For the taking ¶ ¶ Get wicked ¶ ¶ Get wicked ¶ Why, hello, everyone. Guess who's out of the locket. -I'm going to miss this place.  -Me, too. It's just not going to be  the same with all of us going to different schools now. Who knows if we'll ever  see each other again? Friends don't stop  being friends just because they go  to different schools. Of course  we'll see each other. Starting with  the big graduation party at our castle later.  You're coming, right? -Of course!  -Yeah, wouldn't miss it! See you at the party! [snorts] Yo, Princess! Clover, what are you  doing here? You think I'd miss my number one princess and bestest friend in the whole world graduatin'? -[Enchantlet chimes]  -[Chrysta] Sofia,  are you there? -I'm here.  - We thought we stopped  Prisma for good, - but it turns out,  we didn't!  -What? The evil inside  the locket of Vor  took over Prisma. Now, she's more powerful  than ever! And she's got us all trapped!  We need you, Sofia. Don't worry. I'm on my way! -Amber, wait!  I need a favor.  -Again? Just tell everyone I might be a little late to the party. I have to run  a quick errand first. Would this "errand"  have anything to do with floating islands  and Protectors? Well... All right. Fine. But covering for you  is getting to be  a full-time job. Thanks, Amber! You're the best! Well done, Chrysta.  Very convincing. What did I just do? Exactly what  my mind control spell  made you do. Send your little trainee  straight into my trap. Now, go join your  imprisoned friends! [grunts] [grunts] Now I just have to find a way  to get to the Mystic Isles. What I really need is a... [Skye] Unicorn! I am at your service,  as always, my Princess. Oh! Skye! Perfect! To the Isle of Protectors, Skye! Cling tight, my Princess! Onward! -[cawing]  -Won't be long now. Everything is proceeding  just as I planned. Did you plan for Princess Sofia to fly straight at us? Because she is about to! Look! Dive! Take cover in the trees  before she sees us! She didn't see us. Good. Continue to the gate. -Time out, I'm confused!  -What a surprise. First you trick Sofia to get her to come to you, but now you avoid her? What gives? I have decided  that the sweetest revenge is one taken  not on Sofia herself, but on what she holds  dearest to her heart. Her family. Her home. I will trap Sofia  in the Mystic Isles and take possession  of her castle, her kingdom, and the EverRealm itself. -Now, get me to the gate.  -[whinnies] Chrysta! Orion! Vega! -Stop!  -Go no further! -Whoa!  -[Sofia grunts] What's going on?  What is this? Vor has sealed us  in this chamber  with a powerful spell. You can get in here, but you can't get back out. We cannot break the spell.  Vor wields unspeakable power. There must be a way  to get you out. Listen, Sofia.  Vor put a spell on me  to make me call you. She must want you here  for a reason. And I am afraid I know what it is. Vor is sealing up the gateway to the Mystic Isles. If you don't get out now, you'll be trapped here forever! But I just can't leave  all of you like this. Sofia, Vor's goal  is to spread evil  everywhere she goes. And she's going  to your kingdom. If you make it out before the gateway is sealed, you may yet have a chance to stop her. You have to go, my Princess. OK, but I'll come back for you. -Remember your training.  -Good luck, Sofia. Hurry, Sofia!  You really gotta fly if you're gonna reach  the gateway before it closes. Right. I wish I was a unicorn. [Amulet chimes] Come on Clover! Ancient magics, heed my cry. Seal this gateway so none pass by! Oh, is there anything  more satisfying than an evil plan  coming together? There. Nothing can stop it now. The Mystic Isles will be  forever sealed off  from the EverRealm. Come. I have a realm  to conquer. -[whinnies]  -Heeyah! Hang on, Clover! [Sofia]  It's gonna be close! -Did we make it?  -We did. Now, we have to find Vor. [Wormwood cawing] -[cawing]  -[whinnies] [caws] Aah. There is nothing  like the smell of a fresh, unspoiled realm. Ripe for the taking. Yeah, um, speakin' of that, how exactly are you  plannin' on takin' over  the entire EverRealm with just you, me,  and a rickety old raven? -[caws]  -Uh, no offense. None taken, you shifty shapeshifter. The answer to your question  lies in the palm of my hand. Yeah, OK, I don't think I get it. To those lacking imagination, these may seem like mere bits  of lifeless crystal. But with a pinch of magic... and a touch of evil... they will become an army  of crystal minions! [clanging] [sighs] So how  we gonna find Vor? I don't think  it's going to be hard. Look. [gasps] All right,  my crystal minions, listen carefully.  Our first target  will be the castle of that detestable  Princess Sofia. Now, my crystal legion,  march after me! [cawing] [gasps] I can't stop  all these creatures  by myself! -You need help.  -Right. Let's go find some. Come on! Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.  The lighting is all wrong. It needs to be more festive. More magical! Did someone say "magical"? Illuminatus ballroomio! Cedric, it's wonderful! [giggles] Almost as wonderful as seeing the whole family  together again. And speaking of which, where is Sofia? Oh! She'll be here shortly. She just had  a little errand to run. Sofia sure has been running  a lot of errands lately. [whinnying] -Thanks for giving us a ride  to the party, Vivian.  -Yeah, thanks! Of course, you guys!  Any friends of Sofia  is a friend of mine. Ooh! Look at that pretty bird! That's not a bird!  It's a pink unicorn! -Sofia?  -What! -No way!  -How? -Clover!  -Huh? Ow! Ugh. Hi, everybody. Sorry to  drop in on you like this. -You were a unicorn!  -How did you do that? My amulet's magical. -What?!  -Whoa! Listen, I really need  your help. A wicked sorceress named Vor  is marching a crystal army straight for the castle,  and I think our only chance to stop her is  if we face her together. Us? I know it's a lot to ask. Sofia, you've always been there for us, and we will be there for you. Just tell us what to do. OK. First, we need to find  someplace to surprise them before they reach the castle. [gasps] What about  our village? -Perfect.  -Yeah! We can build a bunch  of booby traps, and then hide everything  until they pass by, and then, wham, bam!  Let 'em have it! I can use my magical music on them! Oh! And I'll grow  some nasty little  enchanted plants! Let's draw up the plan. We can help, too, Sofia. Yeah! There's a lot more to us than just adorableness. Well, Vor does have  Wormwood and Twitch  on her side. Think you can handle them? Birdbeak and that shape-shifting rat? Ha! They won't even know what hit 'em. Yessirree! Troopers Crackle and Clover reporting for duty! [neighs] [footsteps approaching] [clanging footsteps] Yeah, so, what about  this village? Are we gonna conquer it? All in due time. First, then castle.  Then, the village. Now! [whinnies] It's a trap! Who dares oppose Vor?! -I do.  -Princess Sofia?! Surprise. -[whip cracks]  -[Sofia grunts] [grunts] [twinkling music] [croak-screaming] [bowling pins falling sound] What are you two waiting for?  Get in there! [whinnies] Oh, yeah,  I'm gettin' in! -[whinnies] Oh! Uh!  -Gotcha! Oh, no you don't! [squeaking] Aah! Oh, yes, we do. -Oh, honey trick!  -You! Me. Now, Crackle! [both grunting] No more of this nonsense. I have come too far  to be stopped by a gaggle  of insolent children. [all grunt] [gasps] Blast! -Lucinda!  -[Lucinda] Hex, hex,  double hex! I was on my way to your party,  and I saw you were in trouble. You got here just in time. Hex! [metal crashing] There are too many of them! We can't hold them off! Ruby, the carriage! -[horse whinnies]  -[Ruby] Whoa, boy! You won't get away  this time, Princess! Everyone, get in! Hurry, you guys!  We gotta go! -Heeyah!  -[horse whinnies] Follow that carriage! -[Twitch yelps]  -[Wormwood caws] -Come on, boy, go!  -[horse whinnies] [gasps] Stop the coach! Whoa! Sofia, what are we doing? Ride to the castle  as quick as you can  and warn my father. I'll slow Vor down  as long as I can. Make sure the king  calls out all the guards  to defend the castle. They're coming! I know. Please, hurry. I've got a better idea, Sofia. You go and warn your father. And, uh, we'll slow them down! -No!  -Like I said, you've been there for us.  Let us be here for you. Sofia, we're running  out of time! Go! OK. Be careful. [Vivian]  Run, Sofia! -Let's go, boys!  -[horse whinnies] [all]  Whoa! [Jade]  Ooh, here they come! Enough of this foolishness! We'll have none of that. Lower your wand,  little witch. -Yes, Vor.  -Where is the princess? She went to the castle. All of you, stay here. [all monotone]  Yes, Vor. -To the castle!  -[Twitch neighs] If only Minimus were here! [amulet chimes] Huh? Wait a minute. I wonder... I wish Minimus  would fly to me. [amulet chimes] [sighs] Dad! Constable Myles! Somebody! [whinnies] Are you in need  of some assistance? [laughs] [footsteps approaching] There's nowhere to run,  Princess. And none of your little friends are here to help you. I don't need any help. [both grunting] [grunting] [grunts] Whoa-oa! Whoa-oa-oa! I... gotcha! Minimus! I heard you calling me, Sofia. I came as fast as I could! [caws] Minimus, how did you...? I told you! I heard you  calling me, Sofia! -You did?  -Yep, just hang on! I'll find a safe place  to take you-- Wait. I know where we can go. Shall we go after them? No. Let Sofia watch  as I take her castle and her family. Baileywick,  is everything ready? I believe so, Your Majesty. What is the meaning of this? The meaning of this  is that your reign is over. En garde! Your Majesty, look out! laser sound] -[cawing]  -Aah! Wormwood! You traitorous  turnbeak! Your crown, please. Never. Oh. Then let me ask again. Your crown, please. Yes, of course. It's yours. Go to that tall tower  and lock yourselves in. -Yes. Let's go.  -Yes, of course. We'd be delighted to. Go with them. And make sure  they don't wander off. This kingdom is mine! And now, I will remake it  in my image! [whinnies] [gasps] The castle! Vor must have gotten in! Minimus, my mom and dad, my whole family. Everyone I know is in there. -Well, we could try  to save them.  -How, Minimus? When we couldn't stop her  the first time? Vor was right!  I can't stop her  on my own. Maybe we could get more help. There's no one left to help. There's nothing left at all. [amulet chimes] [Sofia]  Huh. "The Tale of  Princess Sofia"? [chiming] [chiming] [Voice of the Library]  Once, there was a young girl  named Sofia. It's about... me. She lived in the village  with her mother, Miranda and was happy,  but missed her father, a sailor, who had been  lost at sea. In the nearby castle  lived King Roland the Second, who had wanted a family  so badly, he tried making a wish  in a wishing well. The wish came true,  and twins were born. But the queen  fell gravely ill. -[giggles]  - The children were happy, but never knew  what it was like  to have a mother. Until, one day,  King Roland and Miranda fell in love and married. Sofia treasured her new family  more than anything, and she also  became a princess, with the responsibility  to protect her family, -[cheering]  - friends, and all those  who dwelt in her kingdom. So when the day came  that the evil Vor took everything  Sofia held dear, the young princess  was faced with her  biggest challenge yet. I already tried  to give the story  a happy ending. And I failed. But Sofia, you are  the Storykeeper. -Who are you?  -I was the first Storykeeper. I built this library  many years ago. Filled it with tales that were not yet finished. Not many have been able to follow in my footsteps, let alone someone so young. All whom you love are in danger, and only you can save them, Sofia. But you must be willing  to face this evil on your own. And you must be willing to sacrifice everything. Today may have been  your graduation, but the ultimate test still lies before you. Good luck, Sofia. I'm going back for them. Yes! Let's do this! No. I have to sneak back, and the only way to do that  is to go alone. But I want to help. You can. Fly back to the village and make sure our friends are all right. Then meet me on the far side of the harbor. But do not go near the castle, Minimus. Sofia. Be careful. You, too. Whoa! Oh, right. The boat's  on the other side. I wish I was a mermaid. I wish to be myself again. -[Sofia] I wish to be small.  -[magical twinkling] I wish to be big again. -[Vor] You!  -[guards] Yes, Vor? Gather your fellow soldiers. We have much to do. [guards monotone]  Right away, Vor. [Vor] And you two... I want all traces of  the ex-royal family removed from this castle  immediately. [gasps] She's got them all  under a spell! WhichWay bow, which way  are my parents? They're outside? [footsteps nearby] Sofia, what's going on? My family's in trouble. I have to get  into Cedric's tower so I can help them. Oh! The window!  I just need to get up there. Too bad you can't fly. Oh! I can! I wish I was a bird. [gasps] Sofia!  You're a bird! How'd you do that? Uh, my amulet.  Do me a favor  and get some help to distract those tower guards  in a few minutes. You've got it! Birds of a feather stick together! What? She's a bird now. Oh! Here's one.  Pick a card, any card. [Sofia]  I wish to be myself again. [both]  Sofia? -How did...?  -It's her amulet. She has all kinds of powers. Tell them what else  you can do, Sofia. Not now, Amber.  You all need to come with me. -Right now!  -Why? So I can save you  from Vor! -We don't need saving.  -Everything's fine. [gasps] You're all  under her spell. Spell? What spell? Um... what I meant was... Vor wants me to get a spell from you, Mr. Cedric. She was an un-bewitching spell. Anything for Vor.  Cedric, get her the spell. Right away, Your Majesty. There it is! And a wand!  She wants a wand, too. Of course!  Use my family wand. Thanks, Mr. Cedric. Let's hope all those  sorcery classes paid off. Encantarum Dispivius! [all groaning] Sofia! That sorceress took over our castle! -Who is she?  -She was a Crystal Maker from the Mystic Isles  named Prisma, until an evil spirit  turned her into Vor. The Mystic Isles.  Where all magic comes from. You've been there, Sofia? I'm training to be a Protector. What an honor! I'm so proud. And when exactly  did all this happen? I'll explain everything later. But right now, we have to go. Sofia's right!  Everyone, follow me. I'll take that back,  thank you very much. Wait! The guards! Hm? Hm-hmm! -[Rex barks]  -Huh? [barking] Uh, pardon me. -[crystal minions Huh?  -[Whatnaught chirps] [chirps] Let's go! [Roland]  Well done! -Oh, thanks, Whatnaught.  -[chirps] [Sofia]  Dad, I have to stay. It's not up for discussion. Man the sail, Baileywick! Yes, Your Majesty. [Roland]  Mind the gangplank! [Miranda]  Hoist the main! [Roland]  Hoist the topsail! [Miranda]  Keep the sail tight! Hold that line! We can't just leave! Vor wants to take over the kingdom! First, I have to make sure  you're all safe. Our family is  more important to me  than anything. I know, Dad. You'd do  anything for us. But when you're in charge, it's like the whole kingdom is your family. ¶ ¶ ¶ They taught us  to always be royal ¶ ¶ But what do those words  really mean? ¶ ¶ When you're a prince  or a princess ¶ ¶ When you're a king  or a queen ¶ ¶ We have to look out  for our family ¶ ¶ But our family  is bigger than this ¶ ¶ It includes everyone  in the kingdom ¶ ¶ Every boy, girl,  mister, and miss ¶ ¶ I have to take a stand ¶ ¶ A stand for one and all ¶ ¶ Even if I'm the one  who takes the fall ¶ ¶ Being royal  means being loyal ¶ ¶ To those who count on us ¶ ¶ For the kingdom  I must fight ¶ ¶ For in me  they placed their trust ¶ ¶ For one and all ¶ ¶ I'm standing tall ¶ ¶ For one ¶ ¶ And all ¶ Sofia is right. As the future  Queen of Enchancia, I owe it to my future subjects  to fight for them. I say we go back. I know you mean well, but you're still  only children. I promise, I will gather my bravest men from all across the land and go back once you are all safe. ¶ Once you spoke  of my destiny ¶ ¶ Of all that I'm truly  meant to be ¶ ¶ Now it's finally  clear to see ¶ ¶ The path that lies  ahead of me ¶ I'm sorry, but I have  to do this. I wish I was a flying horse. Wait! [gasps] Sofia? I'm coming with you! Amber! No! ¶ As a prince  and a future knight ¶ ¶ I must go back  and join the fight ¶ ¶ Sir James is right,  we all must go ¶ ¶ To save Enchancia ¶ ¶ Tally ho! ¶ Baileywick,  turn this boat around! Already turned,  Your Majesty. ¶ We have to take a stand ¶ ¶ A stand for one and all ¶ ¶ Even if we're the ones  who take the fall ¶ ¶ Being royal  means being loyal ¶ ¶ To those who count on us ¶ ¶ For the kingdom  we must fight ¶ ¶ For in us  they placed their trust ¶ ¶ For one and all ¶ ¶ We're standing tall ¶ ¶ For one and all ¶ ¶ Though we may fall ¶ ¶ For one ¶ ¶ For one ¶ ¶ For one ¶ ¶ And all ¶ My crystal legion, Enchancia is ours! Now it is time to make  the rest of the EverRealm ours as well. Oh, Sofia, I'm glad  you're all right. I checked on your friends.  They're all under  some kind of spell. [sighs] I don't know  how we're going to beat Vor. Doesn't your amulet  have a power  that can stop her? [gasps] The amulet had a princess inside it once. So maybe, you can  trap Vor in it! Amber! That might be  the best idea you've ever had! Will your amulet be the same if Vor is inside it? If it's not, then so be it. You know, I was thinking we should re-name it the "E-Vor-Realm." Has a nice ring to it, don't ya think? We are not stopping  with the EverRealm. Excellent. I'm sorry,  what else is there? Above the island  of pirates and fairies, beyond the second star  to the right, lies a portal  to another world. When we finish with this realm, I will conquer that one. And my dark destiny will finally be fulfilled. I'll take care  of her sidekicks. That is an exquisitely  evil plan, Vor! I must say-- oh!  Caw! Caw! [grunts] Capture them! [both scream] Now, Sofia! Amulet, I wish for Vor  to be trapped inside you. [grunting] -No!  -[Sofia struggling] Sofia! Amber! [Sofia struggling] Hold on, I'm coming! -[Twitch neighs]  -[Amber gasps] [Sofia struggling] -[Sofia grunts]  -Sofia! Don't let go, Sofia! [struggling] [gasps] [grunts] I've got you! [groans] [pants] I'm not gonna let go! -[Sofia straining]  -Hold on! -Sofia!  -[Sofia yelling] No! [Sofia exclaiming] [whimpering] [neighs] [gasps] She did it!  Sofia broke the spell! [footsteps approaching] [squeaking] -A rat?!  -Facio cageum! You spineless sorcerer! You worm! Facio cageum! [cawing] Hm. Where is Sofia? Vor pulled her into the amulet. -What?  -[gasps] No. Sof? [gasps] [shattering] [gasping] I wish I was out of the amulet. Take me out of the amulet! Silly little princess.  Now what kind of trap  would this be if you could wish your way  out of it? Looks like it's just  you and me now. But not for long. You see, my dear,  I know what makes people tick. Their darkest impulses.  Their greatest fears. And I know your greatest fear  has just come true. ¶ You've always had  a friend or two ¶ ¶ Someone to lend a hand ¶ ¶ When times are tough  you look to them ¶ ¶ To get out of a jam ¶ ¶ But now no matter  where you turn ¶ ¶ There's no one here  but you ¶ ¶ You're all alone,  your greatest fear ¶ ¶ Has finally come true ¶ ¶ Just because I'm by myself ¶ ¶ Does not mean I will fold ¶ ¶ I don't need help  to battle you ¶ ¶ I just need to be bold ¶ ¶ Spare me  your heroic speech ¶ ¶ We both know you are wrong ¶ ¶ I'm not afraid  to stand alone ¶ ¶ Oh, my dear,  you won't be standing long ¶ ¶ You're on your own,  can't run away ¶ ¶ You've met your match  this very day ¶ ¶ I'm on my own  but won't give in ¶ ¶ I'll get back up  to fight again ¶ ¶ The good in you  is fading fast ¶ ¶ And when it's gone  you're mine at last ¶ ¶ But like the sun,  I'll rise once more ¶ ¶ Until night falls  and wins the war ¶ [grunts] Hm. ¶ There's a bond  you'll never know ¶ ¶ A power you can't feel ¶ ¶ The love you give  comes back to you ¶ ¶ And makes you strong  as steel ¶ ¶ If I remember those I love ¶ ¶ I keep them close to heart ¶ ¶ My love will shine  from deep within ¶ ¶ And chase away the dark ¶ ¶ My darkness  cannot be denied ¶ ¶ Your little light  won't last ¶ ¶ I'll show you where  real power lies ¶ ¶ One final wicked blast ¶ ¶ You tried your worst  to keep me down ¶ ¶ But I'm still  standing tall ¶ ¶ How can this be happening ¶ ¶ Because I stand  for one and all ¶ ¶ I'm on my own  I found a light ¶ ¶ To see me through  the darkest night ¶ ¶ You're just a girl,  this cannot be ¶ ¶ I'm more than that  but you can't see ¶ ¶ I maybe small  and own my own ¶ ¶ But I can feel  how much I've grown ¶ ¶ My will is strong  my heart is true ¶ ¶ My love will be ¶ ¶ The end ¶ ¶ Of ¶ ¶ You ¶ [panting] [breathes deeply] [all gasp] What was that? I don't know. Oh, I'm so sorry, Sofia. I never meant  for all this to happen. [sighs] Are we going to be  imprisoned here forever? I-- I don't know. Can you get her out? I might have a spell  that will work, Your Majesty. But a great deal of magic  will be required. Meet me in the courtyard. I know I have the spell. It's got to be here somewhere. [stressed humming] There it is! Father! Mummy! Come to me!  The princess needs you! Come, we must hurry! Place the amulet  right here, Princess. Where's Sofia? Vor pulled her  into the amulet. -What?  -We're going to try  to get her out. Oh, good, a witch.  I'll need your help. Oh, fairies! Even better.  We need to save Sofia! Everyone who is magical,  form a circle. What about the rest of us?  We want to help. We could use all the help we could get, son. All right, fine.  Everyone, join hands! [magical twinkling] Who are you? We are the Protectors  of the Mystic Isles. Yes, yes. No time  for formalities. Just get in a circle! Oh! But what if the spell  brings back Vor, too? Then we'll be ready for her. [Cedric]  Now, I need everyone to concentrate  all of your energy on Princess Sofia  and the amulet. Here we go! Amareen! Evincit! Totum! [Cedric]  Keep concentrating! [gasps] Sofia! Oh! Oh... Oh... Cedric, you did it! You saved her! From now on, you will be known as "Cedric the Great." Thank you, Your Majesty. Sofia, you're safe. What happened in there? Vor is gone. For good. I'm so sorry for all  the trouble I caused. I'm ready to go now. Take her back  to the Mystic Isles. [Prisma sighs] King Roland. Today,  Sofia defended both our realms from an ancient, powerful evil. She has proven herself more than worthy to be a Protector. A Protector? Princess Sofia, step into the circle of light. -Sofia?  -Don't worry, Mom.  I'll be OK. By the power  of the Mystic Isles, I hereby declare you  Protector of the EverRealm. Whoa. Brilliant! Congratulations, Sofia!  I knew you could do it! Well, I couldn't have done it without you, Chrysta. Um, please enlighten me. What exactly does this Protector business involve? Oh, it's a tremendous honor,  Miranda. And only occasionally  life-threatening. [laughs] I'll tell ya  all about it inside. Uh-huh. That's right! We do have a graduation party  to get underway. Please, everyone, come inside. You are welcome, too,  um... Protectors. I love parties! [laughs] -Aah!  -[Sofia giggles] I believe this belongs  to you, Princess. Thank you for bringing me back, Mr. Cedric the Great. Yes, well, it's about time  somebody noticed. See you inside, Sofia. Well done, Ceddykins.  Well done. So proud of you, Cedric. -Sof!  -You're back! 'Tis a relief  you are unscathed! I'm OK, guys. -Talking to animals again?  -Yeah, I am. [Minimus gasps]  Who are you calling an animal? Sofia, what you did today... That was the most noble thing  I have ever seen. I thought I lost you. But we'll never lose each other, Amber. Because we're sisters. Oh, Sofia! Yes, we are. [sighs] You're going to make  a great Protector. And you're going to make a great queen. Amber the First! I like the sound of that! [giggles] I'm just happy to be home. I'm happy you're home, too,  Sofia. [end theme playing]
