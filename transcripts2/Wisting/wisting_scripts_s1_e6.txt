 You mean the Larvik police has committed a miscarriage of justice. I don't mean anything at all, I can prove it. -Robert Godwin was taken on fresh ... -I mean my client Vidar Haglund. What the hell? What is this? Haglund is a Larvik police, with Wisting in the lead, - - Have been innocently sentenced for murder. For 17 years, Wisting, Haglund sat innocent in prison. 17 years. For 17 years, Cecilia Lindes real killer gone free. - Who the hell is he talking about? -Hys, wait. These are very long claims. I have here a copy of the complaint- - Today we sent to the special unit for police cases. It describes how the Larvik police with knowledge and will -I committed offenses to get an innocent man sentenced. The person in charge stands here today, investigation leader Wisting. How would you like to comment these accusations? It won't be right for me to stand here and talk about individual issues. But you were investigator at the time? Hell! He didn't deserve that. I have to go in! Yes... VG here. What do you think of the accusations? You still mean that Haglund is guilty? -What? -Line, you should come to work. - It's about your father. -I will be there at once. What the fuck, Morten? Yes, so fine. Yes. Yes. Come on. It is nice. Are you going in there, then, Tiedemann? What are you going to do then? Tiedemann? Did you find a sausage? When I saw the first page, I thought that it was better that you knew it. Is it finally, or? Everything can happen, of course. But this is certainly the order. Damn! -Hey, Line. - They're looking to take you, Dad. -You are the main posting in VG tomorrow. - What do they say, then? Her claim that he has evidence because Haglund is convicted of innocence. It is produced as if you did something criminal. -Have they called you yet? -No. They will contact you. Think about what to say. -You see what is happening now? -Line ... What they say is not true. I have not... I know. Hi! Frost. How long Have you been working on that matter? The case goes over four sides with a lot of research. You must have known what Her planned. Line, here you are too close. It is difficult, but this is not your case. -You will stick my dad on the front. - Like all the newspapers. That's our job. You understand it if you think about it. What if it's a PR stunt? Do you know that Henden has evidence? Your father gets defend against accusations. Two minutes before the deadline. A dead man is found in Frogner Park. Who should we send? -Is it killed? - It seems like that. OK good. If you want to take some time off, then that's fine. I realize you're struggling working for us now. Or maybe you want to look at this? Maybe it's a better first page. You have two hours on you. -Christine? Hello. -Hi. - I heard about the recording. - I would never say yes. You ... VG called. They want a comment. And Vetti doesn't answer. This was long before my time. So... I need background info to answer. Do we have to say anything? Don't want Her whip up grums to get repetition? He had hardly done so if he didn't know it was grums. I think we must prepare to meet this. Okay, come in. -It was Ingrid who took care of them. -Okay. Yes, here. Lets see. - This picture I remember. - Cecilia was noticed. She was a model in her father's clothing company. She was the other young girl that disappeared in under one year. She was taken under a jog. We thought she was alive. She made a recording the mini disc player from the trunk. We found it a week later. We work around the clock with this. But after 12 days we found her dumped in the beech forest. Shortly after we got suspicion of Haglund. -Why? -Stallteigen farm. Cecilia used to jog past there. A farmer saw that Haglund stood by the path and smoking by the car its- -In the same time as Cecilia disappeared. And he didn't have an alibi. - What was his explanation? -He refused to have been there. But then we got hit. We found his DNA on one of the snips that lay where she was taken. He never did to explain to the court. And then you didn't know Godwin, serial killer, lived in the area? It does not acquit Haglund. I have to ask. Could it be that someone has not done their job? Can anyone have taken shortcuts? As far as I know did all they could. It was good, honest police work. -Hi. -Hello Erik. Can't you dress? I'm stressing out to get VG the perfect picture. -And? - Yeah, well, it did. Let me see. -Wow. -Right? - Is that the victim's dog? -Mm. The bad thing when I arrived. They had to take it with them. I send it to the web editor. Do not even try. That picture is mine, and you will get first page tomorrow. Are you serious now? Killing an unknown, middle-aged guy in Frognerparken? I know. It was supposed to be a girl. Young and pretty. Should you ask the police for a comment? Don't they know who it is? They say nothing now anyway. -We need something more emotional. -We? Who picked up the dog? BE RIGHT BACK Hello! Can I help you? Yes, I can see the dog that stayed picked up in the Frogner Park before tonight? -Whoever..? - Yes, yes. -I'm called Line. I work in VG. -VG? Do you have permission from the police? No, they are so high on themselves, briefer with the uniform when something happens. - My brothers are police. -Oh yes. Not everyone is like that. He's like that. "Look at me, I have both handcuffs and baton. " Do you think you can help me? - This is this one. -It? I call it Drillo. Norway national team coach had such a dog. - Do you want to greet, or? -Yes please. Good boy, then. - Do you know if it's the chip? - I forgot to check. Lets see.... Jonas Rønneberg, Brakstads gate 13. - Maybe I should call the brother. - Does it really hurry? You can't just give me a little head start? -Thanks. Good bye. -Good bye. Jonas Rønneberg, unmarried, insured, childless, parents died. Murder Victim? unverified -Hello? -VG attack by killer. What? Line? Hello? Oh my God! How are you? Hold the front page, okay? I'll send the text soon. I found out where the victim lived. -I came here, so I was knocked down. Wait. Are you okay? Are the police there? -Do you promise? - We have 20 minutes until we have to lock. You get it in 15. It's the shock. The nerves that are in emergency preparedness. It gradually leaves. I've said everything I know. Are we done? - Join the emergency room. -It doesn't go. We have to check you for fibers and DNA and everything possible. I'm at work. I have a deadline in minutes. We are also at work. And you've actually been in contact with a possible killer. -Okay? -Yes. William. - Hey, Frank. -Hi. - Watch you on TV. -Yes. - What do you really want? -Cecilia. The case is being reviewed again. Haglund stands on his own. You're afraid I'm going seek out Haglund and kill him. I'll admit That thought is damn tempting. I do not do that. I want the case up again, get him sentenced for Ellen also. What if it wasn't him? Have you thought about it? We have had a serial killer accommodation for 20 years. -And Godwin ... -Everything is not in any well. - How can we know for sure? -Cecilia was not in any well. Haglund killed my niece. Because we didn't take him, he took Cecilia as well. Don't try to let anyone convince You about something else, William. - Did you get it all? - Very good job, Line. -You get page five. -You are fucking. Do you think so? The whip angle was strong and original. But it's not the first page. No knows the victim and the perpetrator. But it is very good work. Then we run assault VG journalist as a web case. Did you get it with you? -Yes. -He is from Østlands-Posten. -A comment on the posting in VG. -Not right now. Oh, hell. Oh God. Incidents. -Hello! Good day. How has Haglund it? You, I want to say that he is very relieved - - that it is right for the truth to come forth. What will happen next? The new evidence should lead to that we can try his case again. Meanwhile, I hope and believe - the right bodies knows his visiting time -and makes dishonest police officers responsible for the illegalities. Are you aiming for William Wisting? William Wisting was responsible for the evidence against my client. It has, in my opinion, robbed an ordinary and innocent man -17 years of life. So that's a serious matter. Police hero is accused of evidence sickness Get to see. Damn. Poor bastard. Hi! Good morning. Åssen goes here? Has anything new happened? I think you should complain to VG. You look too good on the picture. Thank you, Nils. Soon they will call "The pursuit of love". Okay. Bureau is going to do an investigation. So we have to expect that they will talk with all involved in the Cecilia case. Presumably they will talk to everyone other people also about other issues. - For some fucking piss! -Yes, yes, but ... They have the right to scrutinize Just what they want, so ... Yes. Haglund is guilty as hell. May we waste time on someone who believes otherwise? Do you think we should refuse to cooperate? It is important to be pragmatic now. You had dressed to sit in the group in the special unit. -Hi! -Do you think so? They had never mingle without the hygrometer VG and Henden have created. They have decided to take us. Let them scrutinize us. We have nothing to hide. Let's just show them they're wrong. Hey, William. Can you get into my office? Yes. Are you taking over? -I call VG. -Nils! God, what happened? It's fine. Wrong place at the wrong time. Took a burglar to peach. - I'm waiting upstairs. -Yes. -You must be careful, my girl. - I am, Dad. I'm worried about you. Do you have prepared a comment on VG? -The advisers will write what they want. -No. Listen to me. What is happening now is that newspaper sales and the law of janties goes up into a higher unit. You've been long enough. People will pull you down again. Everyone is looking for negative angles to portray yourself as an asshole. -You, my girlfriend, Line ... - It's all against one. You have to fight. I'm not alone here. I have all the backbone I need. Hello. What's up? I've just gone through the evidence to Henden. There were three snaps, right? And we tested them for DNA. Hand, on the other hand, also analyzed their content. Yes, and then? The one with Haglunds DNA was a Petterøes Blue. The other two were Tiedemanns Gul. Do you understand what that means? No one smokes two different brands. And that's not the worst. The laboratory believes that the snow with Haglund's DNA -The age was out with the other two. Probably one of ours plant cutting. And it was this snipe who fell Haglund. Who nailed him to the place where Cecilia was taken. I want to talk to Haglund. - It's no longer your job. -What? I have to suspend you, William. It was you who was the investigator. The responsibility lay with you. Police scandals are a strong word, but ... - Are you done with the makeup in the bathroom? - I'll take it. Yes, it is difficult to wash your hands. I said I'll take it, okay? You don't have time to pick up between all the blogging? The world must know that they cannot trust the police. World? These police raids is several months ago, Linnea. I'm trying to write about something important. No one cares about the text when attaching such images. Such "look so delicious I am" pictures. Don't you see that? Do you have an overview of who reads this? No? Do you understand what I mean by that such images are abused, or? Nice. Thank you so much for your help, Mom. Next time I take a picture of you. -If people prefer the text. -Yeah, fuck. Excuse me, Morten. It was far above the line. What are you trying for now? What does that hand mean? Where's your line, Line? As a journalist, as a colleague? Do you think you get rid of what anyway because you are young and blonde? Dad, VG has more. Don't know what. Sorry! Yes, but he is not available now. Yes, wait a minute. Copies 545 items 4 min remains Wisting and I have decided that he should go a little back. - Have you suspended him? -Yes. That was the only thing right to do in the situation. Should Hammer take over? You and Hammer are not always agree, are you? One must be able to put your own feelings aside -and keep calm even if we have media on us. Especially so. I want you to take over as acting investigator. -I don't want to talk badly about Hammer. -No, that's not why. Honesty is a property I put very high. We need to restore trust, And I think you can. Oh, sorry. Hello? Take it, you. Don't think I'm keeping this against you personally, William. - We just have to be very tidy. -Ryddige? Maybe I should tell everyone who who really killed Cecilia. She could have been alive now if you didn't had told the media about the disk recording. It was a breakthrough In the case, William. He had to to get rid of her. Our best track killed her. And that was your responsibility. Don't fuck if you seagulls your inability to me! It had been ten days, And you had nothing. Not a shit!
