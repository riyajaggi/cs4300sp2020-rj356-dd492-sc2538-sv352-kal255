 - You're not on the case. - It's words against words. He called the tip phone. We can see that he actually called. I've done mine. Checked and double checked. No one reacted to the tip, because there is no hold on it. The police must be thorough and check everything. We must write about it, if they are not. Skid hole in that sermon and just write about facts in the future. Do you think you can do what you want? - I have to respond when ... - Take care of your own task. - Let Morten take care of it. - It's bad journalism. No! Morten does exactly that, he must do. You have a killing case to cover. Get out and get me something I can use. Or take a day off. What are you waiting for?

Fy the fuck, where did he look. - Here you can sit down. - Yes. You can just sit here, if you want. We have cooking coffee, if you love coffee. And filter coffee, if you prefer. If there is anything else, Then finally come to me. - I answer as well as I can. - Thanks. William Wisting is a hero too many here. You might face some resistance. But we understand the seriousness and would like to cooperate. - Hed du Torunn Berg? - City. Avoid talking about it informally. Let's keep it to the interviews. - Thanks. - Yes. Hi Marianne. I have an appointment with ... - Just go in, you. - I don't have a key card now. - Hi William. - Hi. - Do you want to come in, or? - Yes. He must have saved something in the diaper. He could hardly walk. He was completely ... - Hi William. - Hi. Thanks. You, this witch hunt ... I don't get a shit on it. Yes Yes. Who has shut you in? The same one who has shut you in, I think. Should we talk? Such. - Terje Nordbø, the special unit. - William Wisting. Yes, you are described like a hero. Not just the newspapers. The heroic status will be already taken from me now. You are suspended so you should not actually being at the station. And don't talk to anyone who participated in the investigation of Vidar Haglund. Cecilia case was your first killing case. Yes, as an investigator. It started as a disappearance, but became my biggest case until then. It was a heavy case in the media. Young girl with a famous father. Yes, the whole country followed it. A quick judgment was good for his career. You must have felt a pressure. The year after Ellen's case. Of course. Two sets of relatives had not received an answer. It was bad. You had 180 overtime hours in two months. And a wife alone with twins. You ask if I was cheating a judgment to come home for dinner? Vidar Haglund. You must have felt very safe then. Yes. When I look at it now, I think it is a bit odd. It was Haglund. Who else? After all, that's not the point. The case you are building up against Haglund, is based on weak evidence. - There were many indications. - You lacked that damn proof. I would like to contribute to the process all possible illegalities - - and possible mistakes under my leadership. One man got 17 years in prison based on fabricated evidence. It's not little things, this. Should we find a gab stick and lay flat for VG? We must restore confidence. 17 years. There is justice killings under your leadership. Will you aim me personally? Penalty frame goes up to 21 years in prison. Thanks. Why are you so gentle? The press conference you didn't bother? Don't say the police said something I could have used. They never do. I let as if I took an overview photo - - but instead I took a photo of the table. - What is it? - A call log. I didn't get everything But you can see the last. Torgeir Roxrud. Who can he be? "You're great, Erik. Clever, enterprising, independent. " "What would I do without you? You are nice too. " Well. You're a crazy good sly photographer. We have to find him there Roxrud. - Are you okay? - Yes. What will you? A 19-year-old girl is reported missing. The parents will speak with an investigator. - Are they here now? - Yes, they are pretty upset. She's been here before and stalker. Linnea Kaupang. Get Benjamin to take it. I have an appointment. They specifically asked for an investigator, which is a little more adult. Okay. - Hi. - Hi. - Hi William. Is everything well? - Yeah, that's fine. - Torunn? - Yes? You can easily do this. - You are more than ready for the task. - Thanks. You need to restore confidence in us. - Didn't she come home last night? - No. At that age, young people may need freedom and does not always give notice. She always gives notice. And the school starts again now. During that period there are many parties. Maybe she's met a guy. Or maybe she's taken one concert, you must not know anything about. Or even the mobile is dead. If she was with others, She wanted to borrow a phone. - She could only borrow one. - She's good to let us know. - She's talking to us about everything. - She's very conscientious. Take home because it's pretty likely that she will appear there soon. But give us names and numbers on them, Linda is most often with. - Linnea. - Pardon. Linnea. For a moment I have to ... Benjamin, can you take over here?  - She doesn't take it seriously. - You have to trust that it solves. My colleague Benjamin accepts the contact information. Then I promise we follow up on the case right away. Thanks. - Hi. - Hi. My name is Benjamin Fjell. Have you filled in the contact form? It's Line. I can't go phone, so leave a message.  Hey, my girl. It's Dad.  I'm going to the cottage for a few days to gather thoughts.  But call me if anything Okay? Goodbye.  Wasn't it you you talked to, Last time she was here? Yes, that's right. She was here this winter. - She thought she was stalked. - Yes. And you did nothing, right? No. At that time, it didn't work like that more than a feeling she had. - There was nothing tangible. - What do you mean now? There is one of 18 mm on the right side and one of 20 mm on the left side. Are there only two eggs? I've taken much higher doses. There may also be eggs in the smaller follicles. Pardon. But it may be Last time we try. - Don't worry, Torunn. - Yes Yes. We take out two specimens tomorrow morning. Try to relax. I do a week sick leave for you. You need to relax well and care yourself a little extra. My husband is sexy, delicious and a cool policeman. What is your? Roxrud. - What photos do you want from him? - Grumpy and sad. A bit like this place. Torgeir Roxrud? It was Tiedemann, who got us in the limelight. - Tiedemann? - Jonas's dog. Named after his favorite back. What happened to Tiedemann? - I know Falck picked it up. - I want to offer that it can stay here. - Did he have many friends? - No, not as far as I know. What do you know about him as a person? What were you talking about? Dogs. And then he loved old ones motorcycles. To mess with them. Nothing more personal? Did he have a girlfriend? He had a lady before he moved here. I don't know more. - Where did he live before? - Vestfold. Near Larvik. Someone has decided, that it's only Williams' fault. It's probably hard for him right now. Wisting is probably interested in, that all the facts come to the table. They start with the conclusion. It shoveled to Nordbø. It is easier for everyone with a scapegoat. We continue as before. William lifts the heaviest load. Yes. What should I do, Sissel? What would he have done, if it were you? Cecilia's last move August 17, 2001. Copy of one mini disc recording, Cecilia Linde.  Oh God. Oh God!  I'm in the trunk.  He was waiting for me at Stallteigen.  He has leather jacket on. It happened so quickly.  He drives in an old, white car.  And then he smells sour. He smells of smoke.  I think I've seen him before. Help me!  Let go of me! No! Ouch! Help! - Line? - Tommy? - It was a long time ago. - Yes. Where do we start? We can start with your blue mark. Does your girlfriend beat you? - I was knocked down at work. - So you don't have a girlfriend? No I have not. - What are you doing now? - I am a journalist for VG. Well, though. - Did you go diving? - No, I dropped that. I took the PADI certification But it is deadly. One is to dive in Mexico at 30 degrees. The Oslofjord is something completely different. It's the ski cold. Yes, it is. So what happened? Its a secret. - Nils? - Hi. You are in full swing, I see. Need some help? And food? Well, though. You have been busy. Yes. Is the station doing well? Do you mean with us? Yes, there are lives and happy days. But we walk a little around ourselves. - And Torunn? - Yes. She takes the task very seriously and detail control everything - - with his usual fingerspitzengefühl. She risks dying sense of responsibility and irritation about us. - Then you have to help her a little. - I want to help you. So we can come back to the old one. Do you know who has access? to the evidence store? You have problems with Nordbø, if he discovers you are helping me. Nor have I thought to tell him. Can we let Haglund lie a little and review these instead? The kidnapping theory, the love theory and the group theory. You have begun to doubt. We dropped them, when Haglund came into the picture. - The evidence stands up to him. - The indicators. Stop it! The farmer at Stallteigen saw him. He stood and smoked, while waiting for her. Do you have photos from the confrontation? I remember his finger, when he pointed to Haglund. What if the farmer was wrong? What if Haglunds alibi actually voted? The hand can prove that Aksel Presthus called the tip phone - - with an alibi, which was never studied. - Yeah. Who says that? - Line. It was Frank, who manned the tip phone. You think he can have "lost" that tip? He was convinced, that it was Haglund. We were all together. - What are you about to do? - Speech with Presthus. He is a bookkeeper's nerd, who get gifts from taxi companies. It doesn't make him a liar. If he thinks we've ignored him, can he tell me - - And not to him Philip Henden. Nils! Come on! Nice car. You get a choice. Either you can see me lies bent over the engine - - or you can leave the car and drive with me. Nice car. WITNESS INTERVIEW Nils. Hey. Karsten Brekke? William Wisting. - We've greeted before. - Yes. You appointed Vidar Haglund in a photoconfrontation - - in connection with Cecilia Linde case. Yes. I see you hesitate a little. Wasn't it Haglund, you saw? I thought. But not now? What if I was wrong? Why did you designate Haglund, if you weren't sure? It was he who looked the most. Of all that you showed me, It was he who looked the most. Did you know that the offender wasn't necessarily there? No. Look. There is a rush night. There are lots of comments on Linnea's blog. Has no one seen or heard anything? No, the phone is off, but it is in Larvik. Last time she was here, she said, that she was stalked. She had nothing. It borders on the comic. - Comic? - No ... You know what I mean. I'm looking for game for the party! He drives in an old, white car. He smells sour. He smells of smoke.  And there's something else.  - Sorry, do I interfere? - No no. I just checked something. Can I help you? No. It's probably nothing. But Linnea Kaupang, who was reported missing this morning - - was here this winter because she meant that she was stalked. So I hope that you have followed the matter closely. - Yes that ... - I trust you, Torunn. - You want to make it so beautiful. - I'm on the case. Hammer, four. One two three four. Robekk. Hammer. Find out where the party is and send me the address. 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23. Okay. The Alibi is not worth a shit. Presthus thinks he saw one, similar to Haglund, stand and fish - - across the water, long after Cecilia disappeared. But he could have reached to abduct her and fish afterwards. - What are you doing? - We have nothing, Nils. We had two damn evidence. DNA on a shoe. And Haglund was appointed in a confrontation. The confrontation paved the way for the DNA test. The shutter may have been planted, and Brekke doubts he saw Haglund. He was sure then. You didn't tell him that the offender might not be there. Her hands get the photoconfrontation to work manipulated. Okay. But you talk about our chances in a possible resumption. But what about the blame? It's hard to fiddle with evidence. We could do enough have been more accurate. But rape and kill little girls are much worse. Totally agree. So what if we Did the wrong man get sentenced? We followed a gal gut feeling? We? You mean me. I pushed you enough to find proof. It's also my fault. I should have been methodical. I maybe something that sounded like ... Lie. Cheating in the service? Oh boy. You have such an idiot as me - - everything misunderstands what you say and take the matter into their own hands. God damn. - Is your father home? - No. - Are you sure? - Yes. I do not get, that you still like me. No, I haven't talked to Isabell. Do they follow each other on Instagram? Do we id him, who's pissing her on the blog? Okay good. - Hi. Isabell? - What? Who? - Isabell! - It's her over there. Isabell? Isabell! Hi! I must talk with you. It is not dangerous. Just come by. - Linnea reported a stalker. - I thought it was spinning. - When did you see her last? - In school yesterday. - Have you spoken to her since? - No, she didn't take the phone yesterday. - When did you try to call? - By 21 o'clock. - Oh God! She has done it herself! - What? - She's done it herself. - What? - It's on Instagram. - Show it to me. - Hello! Show it to me! - Here. I give up. Thank you for everything. Hey. Linnea has just posted it here. "I give up. Thanks for everything." My Goodness. Is it suicide? - Is it just laid out? - It looks like Farriswater. That is not certain, that she has completed it.
