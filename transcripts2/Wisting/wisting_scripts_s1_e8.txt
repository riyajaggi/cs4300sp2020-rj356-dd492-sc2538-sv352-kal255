 - What do you know about that? - What do you know? Has he done anything lately? Got an education? An honest job? Don't tell me how to do it live my life. You are not entitled to ... You haven't been here. I came to help you. But it is perhaps best not to. Maybe this can be a mess give you a different perspective. - Here's crawled. What about here? - We are creating a new sector now. We are looking from the country and send divers out there. We've found a mobile, where the boat was moored. We think it's Linnea's. She has the same model. We must ask the parents, if they can confirm it. Can you tell them? They are taken home. - Shouldn't you do that? - I have to go. Do it before someone leaks it. Everyone here knows what to do. Hi Tommy. It's her the crazy father. Can you call back? - I was just about to call. - Is there anything new in the killing? - I am working on it. - Do you? - Otherwise, I heard you were in Larvik.  - Ravneberg lived here before. - And? - The police have nothing.  I have to look elsewhere Finding something useful! Pardon. I know you have a lot about the ears. And I have given you free. But when you work, you work. What do you have that is concrete? Ravneberg worked on the quay. I'm on my way there. They found her mobile. It was in the water. It doesn't. See all the clothes thrown here. I have folded the clothes in the closet. She can't figure it out. She would never have folded its jersey like that. She didn't fold it. She didn't put it there. She did not commit suicide. - Hanne, you have to look at ... - Listen to me! Linnea has not committed suicide. I know her. See all the photos, She has posted on her blog. A lot of half-shit shit! I said so often that it was dangerous! You did nothing, Magnus. You said nothing! And you. She said, that there was a man after her. You did nothing, because you listened does not. Now you listen to me. Someone has taken her. She doesn't committed suicide. A mother knows that. No, she lives. Now be nice to go out and lead. Then break a red car here, when Cecilia disappeared. Why didn't you mention it in the report? - Did you talk to the farmer again? - Yes. Are you now also a private detective? Understandably, now where It has become personal. - Why is the car not mentioned? - It wasn't relevant. Does not? Haglund had a white car. Brekke also mentioned a white car, who stayed here for days up. Brekke is not sure that it was Haglund, he saw smoking. Was Haglund for the court today, he would be acquitted. Someone was waiting for her, but maybe not Haglund. It was neither his car or his shoe. Shall I, of all, now pill The Haglund case apart? It never happened, Frank. Ellen ran. She was quick. Linnea, her who disappeared, did she run too? Come on. A Larvik girl disappears shortly after Haglund's release. He accuses the police and kidnaps more girls while everyone is watching? The timing is perfect. The police are tied on hands and feet. Do you remember the profile from that time? A narcissistic sociopath. Charming and trustworthy. Could awaken sympathy. Violent and zero empathy. He can press the right buttons. Do you remember his confidence? He was sure that he was not convicted. He thinks he's smarter. Wiser than everyone else. And the Godwin case? It was a fucking gift. Now he can blame it on everyone else. He wants us to doubt. Not least on each other. She rows extremely much. Her mother is always after her. Has Linnea behaved differently in the last few weeks? She was completely paranoid over the stalker. She asked the school nurse about pills so she could sleep. - Did she take sleeping pills? - No, she didn't get them. - She was sent to a psychologist. - To BUPA? Yes. She asked for sleeping pills, though had to sit and talk about his mother. - About her mother? - They're not exactly the best friends. The mother hates her blog. He was completely engulfed of old motorcycles. Especially the English he had. BSA or Norton or something like that. He had shown quite a lot. Did he love attention? It can irritate others. No, Ravneberg was a fun type. He could withstand a joke. - I once threw him. Coffee? - Yes. I threw him in, that he moved from the lady. But he was upset, So I stopped. - Why did the relationship end? - Don't they always do that? Cute girl. Swedish. She was called Madeleine. His great love. It is coming, when you least expect it. - What was she called? - It was a little English. Lindell? Lundell? I can not remember it. - Call if you get it. - Of course. She came here the first time some months ago. Due to sleep problems? Sleep problems often occur an underlying cause. Linnea had anxiety and an onset of depression. Maybe because she thought that she was persecuted? Maybe, but she did also problems before. - Which ones? - Conflicts at home. With the mother. Linnea did not feel that the parents accepted her - - and that all she did was attributed attention. - Did you talk to the parents? - One time. We didn't continue. - Linnea said, it made it worse. - How? The mother felt well accused and went into defense position. Do you think she might have hurt itself? Is it likely? If I had meant that it was totally unlikely - - Then I hadn't talked to you due to confidentiality. Jaså. - Did she talk about the stalker? - Yes. She had spoken to the police. But she was more bothered by not to be believed than by the threat. Neither the parents nor the police. She felt completely alone. - We must not talk. - But I have to ask you something.  It's about Linnea. - Have you checked Haglund? - Haglund? Can he have abducted her? Have you checked him?  As far as we know, He has never abducted anyone. Linnea posted a kind of suicide greeting.  Is there a link? Has he been to Larvik? - Beware. That's why I'm asking.  - What should I do? Should I question him without proof, while the hand and the press are watching? Without anything concrete, we must stay far away from Haglund.  - What if it's too late? - You start to sound like Frank. - Yes I know it. - Well. - Can't you let it be? - I have to see who it is. Damn. It is the missing girl's mother. - Hey, are you ready? - Yes. - I don't want morphine. - Are you sure? Yes. I want so few drugs as possible. Should I sing a little for you, so you come in a good mood? No, you don't have to. I wonder why you came to Larvik. - It is well in your papers. - Yes. You were transferred from Oslo. - I guess I was rather fired. - Because? Because someone thought I needed for a quieter life in the province. You were notified for gross service neglect. - What's the point? - That you have the will to rule breach. - I'm not cheating with evidence. - But did you want to enter a colleague? It is quite natural. Loyalty highly valued in the police. And you know Wisting really well. Did he ask you true Aksel Presthus? What the hell do you know about that? Did you visit Presthus? Yes. We took a little talk, him and me. I wanted to hear if he did could give Haglund an alibi. Did anyone ask you to do that? If Wisting engages you in one private, illegal investigation ... - He does not do that. - It is clear that you protect ... Now listen! That was my idea. Is he just as interested in to protect you? - Hi. - Hi. - Do you know more about the shirt? - We are trying to map ... You agree, that she didn't make it there? We map everything to get one picture of what may have happened. It was incredibly vague. Are you looking for the stalker or not? - It's one of our tracks. - One of the tracks? Right now I'm most interested in how Linnea had it. - Yeah? - Why? - I spoke to her psychologist. - Well, so did you? He told you you had a high one conflict level at home. That the relationship between you, Hanne, and ... You must not accuse me to be a bad mother! - I dont do that. - He has a duty of secrecy. He has a duty to provide information, if anyone is in danger. - What do you mean? - It's important to remember ... You mean me as a mother could damage Linnea? No, I don't say that. But, Hanne ... We all want that Linnea comes home safely. We must be able to talk about everything, who may have participated. I do not find you accusing me to be a bad mother. - There is no charge. We must ... - Damn it! We come nowhere! He is coming now. Hey. Sorry, we are disturbing you. My sister is a former colleague to your wife, Ingrid. - Yeah. - So we knew about your cabin here. My name is Magnus Kaupang. This is Hanne. - Our daughter has disappeared. - Yes, I heard that. It must be absolutely terrible for you. Her name is Linnea. She is 19 years old. She is a very sweet girl. We have need help finding her. I understand, but you must speak with the police. I know they ... They think she's committed suicide. We thought you know, how it is - - that your daughter is abducted of a madman. You have experienced it yourself. Unfortunately, it is quite limited what I can do for you. What should we do? Should we go to the newspaper? No, it's a case for the police. I can call exploration manager. Torunn Borg is not interested. Linnea tried to report the madman. We need help from a proper policeman. What do you mean by that? One who wants to fuck the rules for to do the right thing. One like you. - It's mobile. Mobile! - No, Torunn. Would you like to get some water? - Yes? - Linnea's parents have been here. William, you're suspended. They just stood there. They said, that you do not take them seriously.  Did you invite them inside? The daughter tried to report stalker. Did you know? William, stay far away from here. I've got it under control. Do you know where he lives, Frank? I have to know. - Torunn Borg? Hey. - Hi. Now you have to give us something about Linnea investigation. - Do we have to? - I think. I give you a unique chance to give parents an answer. DISAPPOINTED LARVIK-POLICE Why do the parents feel that they are not heard? They have no confidence in us. Don't you think we've had enough negative attention? - I've been to questioning. - I'll take care of it. How did you find out that he lives here? Is it important? - Have you been here before? - No. - What do you think about that? - I have a bad feeling. We must find out who owns the house. There he comes. Didn't he have a bag in? Jo. He has handed something. Food. - She's in there. - We don't know for sure. No, Frank. Now we stop right and think a little. Hello! - We must first know if the house is. - She may be injured. Linnea? No! Jaså. Who are you? - Hello, we're from the police! - You ... Vidar has just gone. It is not me you are interested in? How do you know Vidar? I was there to make him in his time. Yeah okay. Sorry, we disturbed. You, we just gotta see us a little about in your house. Frank! Stop, Frank. We can't search arbitrary people's home. Arbitrary? He's an old sadist. You beat the wife and shod the smokes on the son. Not strange that he was, as he was. The cellar. - The basement? - I'll take a look at your basement. Wait, Frank. She's not here. I paid for them. - Kiss me in the ass. - Pardon. Why did you say that we came from the police? - Maybe he'll call them. - No. Is that what you do? Say you are from the police so people trust you? You need help, Frank. You too, William. That's why we're here. - Hey, come on. Should I do it? - No, I'm coming. - If they ask, answer honestly. - What do you mean? Don't pretend you were the best friends who could talk about everything. - Hi. Is there anything new? - No. We just want to regret that you got it too bad information from us. We no longer know, but we do mapping all communication ... Mapping? Are you sitting in the office and making lists? - Why don't you look after her? - Why do you only go to the lake? - Pardon. Do I have to borrow the toilet? - Of course. Up the stairs. Torunn? Torunn? My Goodness. Stay here. I call an ambulance. What should I use it for? Ravneberg was killed. Shouldn't people know who he was? Heart care over a lady, who slipped 20 years ago - - and that you can't find? Do you also have baby pictures of him? What are you doing? Now you take a week off. I will neither see nor hear you. And never send something like that again. Hi Tommy, can you call me? I need to talk to you. I have had a shit day at work. So Torunn is on sick leave for at least a week. Promise me that at least you talked to the parents. "Help us find Linnea". Several hundred participants in the father's search. Østlands-Posten and Sandefjords Blad writes about it. - I didn't know you were a carpenter. - No. Me neither. There must be a bar here. With a very popular touch. - Is that yours? - Yes. I start it with a couple of friends. - Is that so surprising? - No, I'm just ... You just never believed in that I could become something. Just like your dad. Pardon, that you had to deal with him alone. I did not believe, that he would come home. What have you actually said to him? That I have destroyed your life? I don't expect that he likes me. - But ... - I know. Pardon. Do you want something to drink? Have you already opened? No. But now I have. Come here. A little longer. - What are you doing here? - I just want to talk. - Yeah. - I do not hate you. You thought it was me and then acted. And now you have become a victim, Just as I was a victim. - Are you so happy? - No, I don't want revenge. I do not want, that someone should be innocent. I know it all too well. One must break the vicious circle - - and do something different, no matter how you enjoyed it. I know who did it. Who planted the shutter. Or rather, I know how to find out. Has Her got you this? When you live on 8 m2 for 17 years, Then you have plenty of time to think. I've tried to figure out how my dna ended up on the shutter. But when Henden got analyzed the shutters, I understood. One evening your colleague comes in in my cell and bid me a cigarette. Without any reason. We were down in the yard. Who was it? I can't prove it, But you may. Visit Protocol. All visitors should enter. Why are you coming to me now? Because I've realized something now. I never get my life back. Maybe I will resume the case. Maybe I'll be acquitted - - wins the appeal and may even get compensation. But I always want to be him, who was convicted. Him, people are watching and talking about.
