 flies to us today Jerry Bernstein of the NSA. God We will work Jerry Bernstein? And communicate with the NSA. You will communicate with the Americans only through him. I hope this does not become for you a problem? Of course not, I'm his fan. We corresponded a lot with him regarding September 11, 2001. “Is he a terrorist?” No, Whitehall introduced this post as part of the program for the exchange of information. He will arrange us access to American resources and he is said to have rich experience. - Maybe then order pizza? - He will be tired after the flight. It doesn't bother me. And how long will he come to us? Yes, if she plays by the rules.

 Man, let me go. Mary, where is cryptanalysis last week? Stop it please. Sorry my cat its a little spoiled.

And I accidentally stumbled to the browser story of Matthew McConaughey. Why the cyber security center DSP climb into browser history Matthew McConaughey?

Well, where is she? - Well, let's go? “I'm sorry, Jerry, I'll have to wait.” - Why? - A little check, it's quick. - Because you... - No no, just need to check the suitcase. - Thought he was yours? No, this is a normal procedure. They always do that. Clear. Because you... Us here. Jerry, this is Chris Cranfield, Director of the Center for Cybersecurity - A! - It can’t be, I was expecting a man.

This is Mary Needham, the best in our office. - Best of what? - In cryptanalysis. Mary is one of the first women professors nominated for the Nobel Prize. - Wow. Have you won? No, and unfortunately earned cystitis that day. - I think because of stress. - Great story. Can I turn on the condo? Here are twenty-three degrees and I found out that my group works better at twenty-one. - Yes I can... - Not. Sit down please, Joseph. Yes, you will record after me. Stay. Attention please! From now on, I am your best asset. I came for you so use me exploit, punish. To make you feel it’s like they loaded me into each of you, even in you. - What are you doing? - Welcome all. “Can they stop there?” - No, they are busy. Bank of England Alas, we can do without the Americans. Listen to what I tell you. I am very happy about all this. We will learn a lot from each other. Especially with me. And we are glad to cooperate with our oldest and closest ally. Welcome to the Government Communications Center. Thanks. And now for the job! Good morning! - Hello! Do you like plants? “They will die in three days.” Don’t be afraid, I sprayed them with glue, and now they, consider, are mummified. By the way, where is the personnel department? I would like to get a pass. On the fourth floor, but they are all on vacation. Have you scored schoolchildren? Come on, every... Wait a minute. Hi Jerry, is everything all right? - Yes. Do you know what this stain is? - I can’t hear you. - What is this stain? “I can't hear from behind the glass.” Maybe then you’ll come in? Yes, sorry Jerry because of the glass can not be heard. - No problem. What is this spot? - It was Elaine’s office, there could be anything. - He died here?

This is in the human resources department, they will do in a week. - I would like it early. - It does not matter, I will lead you. Now? - Go on. - Yes. At the same time I will give you an excursion. “Have you stayed in Cheltenham?” - Yes, at the Citrus Hotel. Glorious, I was there at the wake a couple of times, the food is excellent. So, look here for a second - this is our special room of silence, where they move away from the horrors of the Internet. “Can you pee here?” - No, actually it’s impossible. And I sometimes write. What a huge building we have! They probably changed the lock code. Here. - What is it? - Already almost arrived. Ta-ak. Now. - Come on again. - Wait, which side... - Spend it again! - Now! Yes to you! Nothing, nothing Now we enter the code... Jerry, could you dictate after the four. - Then? Fours? - Yes, four. - There is no four. Maybe a unit? - Four. - Unit?! - Yes, one. One... - Nine. - Nine. - Two. - Two, seven. It should work. You see! Sorry, sorry! Here you still need to put your finger, True, it does not always work after the chips. “Why didn't you attach right away?” - Because I ate chips, and it does not always work. - Back, back... Give me your finger here. What is wrong? You are so small... - Happened. - Well! Yeah be wrong. Now, the moment, we need more on the iris... Well, how much longer to wait?! Damn, no way. I have a lazy eye and sometimes it... Can't you lift it? - Let's go! I go! - Come in, come in. Yes. USA. he has eyes pretty close set and he also had a connection with his cousin, so that... - What the? - I'm sorry, Chris, I'll delete. Never mind. Where is the printout of the report by the Bank of England? The printer is not working, I can’t... - Dossier on Jerry. - Quiet. What is it? I could not open secret file therefore made a cover. - Here I am! And he didn’t even get lost. - Hi, Jerry. Chris, I understand what your problem is. - You have a problem with fighting spirit. - Exactly. Thanks. Therefore, first you need turn on some music because everyone here is like a zombie. Do you have Alexa here? Alexa, turn on the second dirty NSA mix! Alexa? Alexa? Secondly, you need to raise money and create a gym. - Yes! - Get pumped with endorphins. Thirdly, you can somehow do it, so that I can see the sun? So, I will interrupt you. First of all, I’m not your secretary, I am a division director cybersecurity DSP. My grandfather invented bouncing bomb mom was a triple agent during the cold war and dad was the first to invent such a thing as the Internet. I'm sorry, but I do not care indoor plants and natural light. Secondly, here you are not the NSA, you are exclusively here for networking. We don’t swing, we don’t listen to playlists. We fight cybercrime terrorism and sex slavery. Thirdly, this is my unit, my employees and let me be very glad to cooperate with our oldest and the closest ally I will not allow to undermine my authority just because that some fool from the government thinks they can fight cybercrime better than us. Nothing if I get back to work? Looks like you stopped talking. I'm still deaf after the flight. Did you say something important? Will you endure such an attitude? A? A? Rag! Evelyn... I drive results for the Bank of England. Call me the car to the entrance. Ok don't forget the meeting at the Bank of England. Do you need to call a car? Hold on, old man, you can do it! Yes? Jerry, I'm wildly sorry what Chris said. You must be offended. Do you know how long I work at the NSA? - Fifty years? - Two... Twenty-five years. - Sit down. - Sure. Can you imagine what experience can be purchased twenty-five years of service at the NSA? - Nope. In fact, I know everything in the world. I watched the intrigues of the terrorists cyber attacks, attempts on life... - On yours? - Shut up for a moment. - Yeah. I predicted the eleventh of September, Afghanistan, bombings in London... - When you say, predicted... “Could I have prevented them?” - Yes. - I think yes. - Wow. But did anyone listen to me? Not. Forever alone I am the same garbage: "Take your time Jerry, analyze no evidence." - Yes. But what about the good old American flair? This is exactly what we are missing. - Have you sensed what will happen on September 11, 2001? - Yes, it hit me like a thunder. And one more time a moment later. You must have been in trouble? What? What am I? Yes you just look you'll like it. Go here. Come along. - Yes? - Yes! Take a look. - My God. - Touch it! - No I do not want to... - Touch it! - Do not touch! Forty-fourth caliber. Right through. Wow. I have the exact same scar after lipoma removal. - Here is a tyutelka in a tyutelka. - Nothing like this. “That's exactly the same.” - This is not a lipoma. “It's a bullet scar.” - And from that side... - No! - Can? - No, everything healed there perfectly, and nothing is visible. “Why were you sent here?” - Relax? - Yes, like that. Old man, you have no idea how lucky you are with me. And do not say. Personally, I'm insanely happy. I could be in Paris, Milan, New York, but I chose London. - Cheltenham. - Cheltenham. What's the point of hanging around here if you do not change the situation for the better? - I will not argue. Of course I could stupidly keep in touch until you lose heart rate, but I want to boost morale. Understand it so highly that people would even move with difficulty. - You understood me? “Not even... Yes.” I’m so uplifting that people will run home. - People will like it. “And you will help me.” Whatever you want, Jerry, just say it. Consider me your personal assistant. I thought you were my assistant anyway. Come on guys come, come. Get into the circle. You too. You are also a team drop that bullshit. All come, come. Pack up pack up it is very important. - Like this. Take a closer look. Not by that much. - Sorry. Wonderful. Look, we stood in a circle. Awesome. So, the first thing to the core I was struck when I arrived here, this is your depressed look. Do not misunderstand me, each individually looks... amazing but the general impression is like wandering around an abandoned farm. Do you understand me? In general, for starters, I would suggest team building exercises. - Great. - Yes. - Yes? - Buzz. - Yes? - Yes. - And now all together: "Yes, Jerry." - Yes, Jerry. - Yes, Jerry. Okay, we’ll work on it. Take your hands out of your pockets. - Ready? - Yes. Jerry says: raise your right hand. Lower it. You are all out! Everyone dropped out! Now take a step to the right. Excellent! Jerry says, "Take a step to the left." - God. “I got you wrong, right?” - Yes. Therefore, listen carefully. In my clap fall. Have fallen! For a start, not bad. Okay, get up. Get up. Anyone hurt yourself? No problem. The main thing is trust. At the expense of "three" I ask everyone to undress. Undress! I joked, stop it! Where is your dignity? Keep exploring each other: faces, bodies. And now I ask everyone to tell when was the last time you had sex. This is a great way to get to know each other, open up. We at the NSA do this every day. - Sex? - Sometimes. What do you say, my friend? Hell, depending on what you mean. “You don't know what sex is?” - No, I know what sex is, just... hey, where are you? - Mary, do you want to start? “Hell, that was a long time ago.” Sorry. - Noticeable. I can smell your pheromones. - Thanks! “You must be a bawdy.” - Not. It's sexy that you deny it. Tuva... - At 10:15 this morning. “You came at eight.” - Well yes. - What are you doing?! - Chris, join in. We are engaged in team building. No, get back to work. That's funny! Really, Chrissy, I do it just because that it is absolutely necessary. Also, see how everyone has fun. We came here not to have fun. This is a communication center. Do you think Alan Turing had fun? Well, all for work. No wait. Listen, I understand you absolutely don't need dashing american fox in your stiff british chicken coop. I didn’t want that either. But I'm sure we will work together. - Come on, eat at least candy. - Never. Shouldn't we cooperate? A team? Yes Jerry! Do you really want Did your employees see you like that? Eat candy. Eat candy. Okay! Hurrah! Jerry said, "Fall!" Jerry fixed the printer! You see. Therefore, they sent me here! - Good Night! - Good Night!
