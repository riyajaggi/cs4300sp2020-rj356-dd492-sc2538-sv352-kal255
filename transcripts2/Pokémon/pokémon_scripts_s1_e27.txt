 ♪ Pokémon! Gotta catch 'em all ♪ ♪ Gotta catch 'em all Pokémon! ♪ -[Ash] Scissor Street? Why'd we come here? -[Brock] You'll see. [Misty] Sure are a lot of Pokémon beauty parlors. [narrator] Ash and his friends take a walk along Scissor Street. Why have they come here? Only Brock knows the answer. -Hm. -Is there any place special you want to visit, Brock? -Hm. -Wait a minute. I just remembered that Scissor Street is also called Breeder's Lane. -Where is it? -So that's why we're here. Brock's always got to see the latest breeder gear. [narrator] Brock dreams of becoming a Pokémon breeder, a person who devotes his time and energy, learning how to raise the best Pokémon.

 [Ash] Pokémon Fashion Flash Some of the best breeders have shops here. There are lots of terrific makeup places and fashion salons, too, just for Pokémon. Hey! Oh, look. This must be the newest fashion. -How cute! -You think that's cute, huh? Come on. We've got to go in. -Whoa! I don't want to go in there. -Hm. [James] You won't believe how beautiful a Pokémon can be. Step in and see for yourself. Let us dazzle you with the latest fashions by the expert artists of Salon Rocket. -Did he just say Salon Rocket? -Why does that name sound so familiar? [Brock] Whoa, is that supposed to be a Pokémon or a Christmas tree? [both scatting] Bring your drab old Pokémon to Salon Rocket for our complete Pokémon makeover, including jewelry. And hairstyling. [both] We'll make your Pokémon a pretty-mon. Ta-da! We've done it again, another Pokémon fashion masterpiece. [James] I can't believe how talented we are. Your Pokémon have gone from frumpy to flashy, thanks to Salon Rocket. -Oh! How precious. -What? [all gasp] 120, 130, 140, 150, 160 -[both] Please come back again soon. -200. You two are spending way too much on advertising. TV commercials are a big waste of money. Remember, we're in this to make a profit. We know what we're doing. The more we spend to hype this place, the more customers we'll get. Customers who will spend thousands for a fashionable Pokémon. [panting] -I think I'm going to get in line. -Huh? -It's there! -[both] Huh? [panting] I found it! I've been looking all over for this place. This is the store you've been looking for? [trembling] -What are you so nervous about? -[woman] Hi. Can I help you? [screams] Just relax. Release all your tensions. [trembling] Now you'll have more energy. Chansey. Chansey. Chansey! Chansey! I've come for you, darling. Ah! Don't you look precious. Thank you for bringing Chansey to my salon. -See you soon, Suzie. -Chansey. -May I help the next customer? -Pika. We're just kind of sort of browsing around. -Uh, no, uh. -Look! Isn't that Vulpix the cutest thing? -Oh, don't you want to hug it? -[Ash] Ah! -Pikachu. -What is it? [Pokédex] Vulpix, a fox Pokémon. Its six tails are extremely beautiful. As it evolves, it grows even more tails. I love its hair. I wish I had hair like Vulpix that looked so shiny and soft. -Don't touch it! -You're just about the cutest -little Pokémon I've ever seen-- -Ah! [yawns] -Very cute. [groans] -Hm. [Pokédex] Vulpix uses powerful flame attacks. Duh. Please pardon Vulpix. It doesn't like to be picked up or hugged by strangers. -Wish I'd known that sooner. -Uh, Suzie? Yes. Uh, my name's Brock. Nice to meet you, Suzie. Uh, I want to breed like you. I mean, I want to be a breeder like you. It's very nice to meet you, Brock. I'm flattered you want to make me your model. Yes, I want to model you. I mean, I'm flattered that you're flattered. I mean, your Vulpix is nice. -Uh. -Huh? What I'm really trying to say is, Suzie, I'm begging you to accept me as your pupil. -[all gasp] -Pika. You got to be kidding, Brock. Mind your own business, Ash. I know what I'm doing. Please say yes, Suzie. [groans] I don't have pupils, Brock. Breeding takes up all my time. What makes her such a great breeder anyway? How dare you! The sensational Suzie of Scissor Street has been awarded the trophy for excellence at the World Pokémon Breeder's Contest for three consecutive years. Wait. There's more. Lights. In addition to that, the readers of Pokémon Friends magazine named her the most popular breeder four years running. And her hugely popular website records over 10,000 hits per day. Now, that's what I call a great breeder. You better believe it. Okay, Brock, we heard you clear and loud. I wonder if this Vulpix has ever won any awards in competition? That's a fabulous question, Misty. Vulpix is the hottest supermodel of the Pokémon world. Notice the gorgeous, flowing tails that have made Vulpix a champ. -Plus there's-- -We get the idea, Brock! -Vulpix is terrific too. -[yawns] So all three of you are traveling on a Pokémon journey together. Pikachu! Pi! [Suzie] Your Pikachu has a beautiful shiny coat. Are you the one who prepares all of Pikachu's food, Brock? -Yes! I do. -And it's Brock's own recipe too. My career as a breeder also began when I first became interested in Pokémon nutrition. [mutters] [all gasp] Pi! Mm. Mm. Whoa. -Vulpix. -[Brock] Ah! I can't believe Vulpix is eating the food I made. Brock, this is really impressive. Vulpix never eats food that I haven't made myself. Looks like Vulpix is a fan of Brock's cooking. [trembling] Uh, thank you, Vulpix. -[grunts] I'm not worthy. -[Suzie gasps] [Misty] Suzie. We saw some super-fancy-looking Pokémon when we were walking down the street. Is that really the latest trend? By any chance, did you pass a very large salon on the way? Mm-hm, you mean that really tacky-looking place. Ever since it opened, some trainers are trying to make their Pokémon as flashy as possible. So that salon started the trend. A good breeder is always trying to bring out a Pokémon's inner strength and personality. But this new fad is about standing out, not what's inside. I don't like it either. It's pretty stupid to waste your time showing off. But sometimes even Pokémon like to get dressed up and show off a little just like the rest of us. Right, Pikachu? I see it now. Pika, pika? I think Pikachu's perfect the way it is. We don't need any goofy fashions. It's what's going on inside that really counts. I never said the inside wasn't important, but the outside counts too. The inside is what matters. -Outside too. -Inside! -Outside too. -Inside matters the most. The outside matters too. -Inside. -Outside too. -Shouldn't you stop them? -That's like trying to stop the tide. If you think fashion's so great, how about taking your Psyduck to that salon? Hey, what a great idea. Let's go, Psyduck. Psy-ay-ay. [laughs] Now we'll see who gets the last quack. Ha! Anyway Psyduck and I are so cute, we'll look good whatever fashion we wear. I'm sure Psyduck will. What do you know about fashion? -Right, Psyduck? -Psy-ay-ay. Duck? This may be more of a challenge than I thought it would be. Better get going. Ha! You'll be jealous when we get back from the salon and Psyduck turns out to be even cuter than Pikachu. -Come on, Psyduck. -Psy. Psyduck. Psyduck. Psyduck. I wonder if it's what's on the outside or what's inside that really counts in the end. Ever since that new salon opened, I've been wondering about my methods. -Don't say things like that. -[gasps] Suzie. You've got to keep following the path you believe in. We have to stick up for what's inside together. -Right, Pikachu? -Pikachu. That's very kind. But how can we? If they want to put style over substance, we'll give customers substance with style. Uh, there are still a few seats left in the back of the room for our lecture on Pokémon care. Each Pokémon needs your special care and attention. Whenever a Pokémon's been injured in a battle, it should be given a therapeutic massage. Pika. Hey! Wait! Where did everybody go? -Say, weren't you over at Suzie's? -Yeah, I saw you there. Suzie's lecture just started. It's a series about Pokémon care. Today she's talking about massage. A lecture on Pokémon massage? This volunteer and his Pikachu will now demonstrate the techniques we learned in today's lecture. Mm-hm. As you may already know, a Pikachu's electric sacks are located in its cheeks and they become very tense after a difficult battle. Pika, Pikachu. Ash, would you please massage Pikachu's cheeks just like I showed you earlier? Uh, sure. Pikachu. -Ah, let's see. -Ha! -Maybe... -[Pikachu giggles] -[chuckles] How's that feel, Pikachu? -Pika. -[woman] That's amazing. -Wow. Good communication between Pokémon and their trainers is essential. These techniques build trust and bring out a Pokémon's personality. I think Suzie will agree with me that any technique is only as good as the trainer or breeder who uses it. -[woman] I never thought of that. -[all sigh] -[James] The perfect touch. -[Jessie] One last rose. Voila. This Squirtle shell has become the perfect advertisement for our latest line of Pokémon fashions. Oh, yet another masterpiece from Salon Rocket. Roses are the flowers of love and romance. [sighs] We also paint daffodils. Squirtle. Meowth, send in the next customer, tout de suite. Can't you see I'm counting money here? Hmm? Only one customer? One or one million, it doesn't matter as long as we have customers who appreciate true beauty. We only want to offer our services to the most refined customers. We're not going to make any money that way. Hello there, everybody. -[all gasp] -Huh? -Welcome, young lady. -Hmm. -[both] Oh. -[Misty] Hey, what are you doing? -[James] Step in. Don't be shy. -No, not me. Psyduck. [Jessie] Don't be so hard on yourself. You're just as lovely as any Psyduck. [Misty] Hey. Hold on a second. -Psy. -[James] It's another masterpiece. You like it? Oh, I love it! You've really captured the real me. You're totally amazing artists. I look so cute. I'm thrilled. There's nothing that pleases us more than a satisfied customer. Oh, why don't we try out even more new styles? [both] Time for a makeover! -A dab of rouge. -[James] A bit of blush. -[Jessie] A smidgen of lipstick. -[James] A modicum of mascara. -[Jessie] A pinch of powder. -[growls] Forget about that makeover. She hangs around with that Pikachu. We got to grill the kid to figure out how to steal it. Hey, wait. You're Meowth. We were trying to find out until you blew our cover! First you get the opponent to relax, then you pump them for info! So stop pumping me and get that Pikachu! [both yelling] I'll never tell you phonies anything! Ah! So you figured out the truth. Well, you'd better tell us where Pikachu is if you don't want your face painted just like Frankenstein. Heh. Do I want a face like Frankenstein's? No, I don't. -Hey, Psyduck! -Psyduck? -Where'd Psyduck go? -I don't see it. -It's gone! -Psyduck. Psy, psy, psy. Psy, psy. Psyduck. Psy, psy, psy. Psy, psy, psy. Psyduck! [all] Huh? -Pika? -Psyduck! Psyduck! Psy, psy, psy. Psy-ay-ay-ay! Pika! Pika! Pika! What's the matter? Has something bad happened to Misty? Pika! Pika! [Ash grunts] Pikachu! [Ash grunts] -Misty! -Pika! -[all] Huh? -[both] It's Team Rocket again! What took you guys so long? [both] What happened to her face? [grunting] -Dumb boys. -[grunting] -Let Misty go right now! -Sorry, you'll have to wait your turn. We won't be finished with her makeover until she looks like this. We're conducting some important beauty research. Beauty research? Can't you understand it's the beauty inside that counts? Every Pokémon is beautiful. We just have to help the Pokémon discover it. What's she talking about? What does she know about breeding Pokémon? Who cares about the inside? Outside counts. What do you two numbskulls know about Pokémon breeding? This whole Salon Rocket idea's supposed to be a scam remember? -[gasps] -It was a brilliant plan. Part one, think up some stupid Pokémon fashions and take piles of money from the trainers. Money? What? And part two, whenever a trainer brings in a rare Pokémon, first get the trainer distracted, then steal the Pokémon on the spot. -What? -[laughs] And our greatest masterpiece of all will be that Pikachu of yours. How about a trade? This twerpy girl for your Pikachu? [gasps] If you're trying to steal Pikachu, we're going to battle. -Count me in too. Tag team. -Pika! [laughs] Salon Rocket is ready with our own fashion-battle platform! -Here goes. -[all yell] [Jessie] And now Salon Rocket presents a fashion extravaganza and Pokémon battlethon. [Jessie] To protect the world from boring fashion [James] To dress all people with flash and passion [Jessie] To give all Pokémon pretty faces. [James] To extend our art to outer spaces. -Jessie. -James. Salon Rocket. When it comes to chic, we know what's right. Surrender your taste or prepare to fight. Oh, we're supposed to battle on that? -Dazzle them, Ekans. -Knock them dead, Koffing. -Ekans. -Koffing. We don't need costumes. Pikachu's super-energized from that massage. -Go! -Pika! Geodude, go! Ugh. -Geodude. -Geodude, give them the seismic toss. -[both grunting] -Ekans. Ekans! -[grunts] -Thunder shock, now! -Pikachu! -Koffing! Pika! Koffing, cutie. Sludge makeover! -Koffing! Koff! -Pi! -Ah, Pikachu! -Geodude! Now the finale. Go! Koffing! Oh, no! It's a fashion disaster. Get up, you guys! We've still got a battle to finish. Let's go! Koffing! [screaming] -Now what? -Vulpix and I will take care of them. We'll give your Vulpix a makeover when we get rid of its tails. Time to give you a lesson in breeding. If all you worry about is your Pokémon's outer beauty, -its inner strength will be lost. -Vul. A Pokémon is like a fashion model. All that counts is a pretty face. -Like mine! -Ekans! Vulpix! Wrap them up with fire spin! [grunting] [all yelling] [all screaming] [both] Save the gowns! Hey! Don't fire spin me! Help, help, help! [all] We're blasting off again! Now, that's an attack. [Pokédex] Vulpix's greatest attack, fire spin. Using powerful flames to block its opponent from moving, it then inflicts great damage. Did you see that? A cute exterior hides inner strength, that's the Pokémon's true personality. [crowd murmuring] -[Misty] Psyduck! -Psy? Just when I really needed you, you ducked out on me. Get up here quick and untie me. Untie me now! [coughs] Psy-ay-ay! Nice work, Vulpix. Thanks to all of you, I believe in what I'm doing again. You helped me regain confidence in my beliefs. Heh. It's not hard when the person you're helping's as great as you are. -And, Brock? -Uh, yes? I was very impressed by the way you handled your Pokémon in a crisis like that. Suzie. I have a lot more to learn about breeding Pokémon. Even if I do have a championship, I'm still a student, not a teacher. Looks like you and I both have journeys ahead of us. You leaving, Suzie? What about your Pokémon salon? There are things I can only learn if I leave here. I want you to continue your journey too, Brock. -From now on, we're rivals. -Uh, sure. -Vulpix. -Ah! I'd be grateful if you took care of Vulpix for me. -Huh? -You're the first person other than me that Vulpix has been friendly with. Right now I believe you could do a better job -of raising Vulpix than I could. -Vulpix. -Mm, thanks. I don't know what to say. -[Ash gasps] Pika. You don't have to worry, Vulpix. I promise I'll take good care of you. All right! I got Vulpix! [chuckles] Hm. [laughs] Hey, what are you laughing for? This makeup is very fashionable. [narrator] And so Brock must continue down his own path to becoming a Pokémon breeder. With Vulpix, he has a new friend on his journey and he has a new determination to be the greatest Pokémon breeder of all time. [all screaming] Now, we need a total makeover so nobody we ripped off can recognize us. They're all just jealous because they're not attractive enough to wear our designs.
