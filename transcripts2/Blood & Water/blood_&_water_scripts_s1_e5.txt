 Well, your email said it was urgent, so let's get to the point. Okay. One of your students is having an inappropriate relationship with a teacher. Inappropriate meaning? Meaning they're intimate, sexually. Right now we're behind schedule for the next publication, so I suggest we... Sorry. Um, can we talk? Okay. - Who is it? - The student?

 Both. Coach Chad and Fikile Bhele. What? So I spoke to KB... about everything that's happened. It made me realize how out of character this is for me. So I wanna apologize for dragging your family into all this crap. I'm sorry. Truce? Are you aware of the seriousness of your allegations? - Yes, ma'am. - Do you have proof? I have a witness, but they would like to remain anonymous. Sure. Apology accepted.

 I really appreciate it. I think we were both out of line. Will you forgive me too? Of course. Did you sign the school's code of conduct? Yes, Mrs. Daniels. Were you forced to? No. So you do understand that failure to report any betrayal of school rules makes you complicit. And it could result in immediate suspension, or even worse... - expulsion. - What? But Mrs. Daniels, I... Did you sign the code of conduct? Do you wish to violate it? No, ma'am. Thank you. It means a lot. Hey. What was her name? Your sister. Phumele. Phume for short. Pretty name. I really hope everything goes okay with your dad. I mean it. Sorry. I was just putting it on silent. Make sure your witness comes by my office before the end of day. Or be prepared to face some serious disciplinary action. Yes, ma'am. Hey. How is everything? Tell me you didn't say anything about Fiks and her coach. - Define "anything." - Oh, my gosh, Wendy... What did you do? What you expected me to do when you told me. - What does Fikile have on you? - Nothing. - Then why change your mind? - She apologized. Apologized? Yes. When are people finding out about this? Maybe we can put a stop to it. I don't know about that. What do you mean? I told Principal Daniels that I have a witness. - She wants to see you after the break. - You told Daniels? You have to tell her, Puleng. Otherwise, I'll get suspended. She'll think I'm making all of this up. - Please just go see her after the break... - No. I should've never sent that voice note to you. Fikile doesn't deserve this. What if I don't? Fiks and Coach Morgan are sleeping together. I saw them kissing at Fiks's birthday party. Do with that what you want. ♪ Blood ♪ ♪ Blood and water ♪ What's up? You seem a bit off. I'll be fine. Just got a lot on my mind. Okay, I have something that might cheer you up. Hold up. Let me just find it. Cool. What is this? - Do you like it? - Yes. - Is this you? - No, no. I didn't make it. My homey Zhero did. We're working on a mixtape together. Our first mixtape. That's amazing. - For real? - Yeah. You know, I could, like, totally play the triangle on it or something. Wow. Actually, you could do more than that. How about we record you singing that verse of poetry for me? Okay, okay, look, before you say no, think about how dope it's gonna be. Zhero and I will be there guiding you the whole time. I don't know. Can't I just play the triangle on it? - Come on, Puleng. - I'm not a pro. You're like the muse, though. You know, you inspired all of this. We have to have you on the track. Or I could take your picture. Make it the album cover and call this whole thing The Muse. - Enough with that already. - I'll stop if you record with me. Please? Fine. - Deal. - Dope. Dope, dope, dope. Okay, so come to my place after school. - Let's make some hits. - Okay. - Thanks, muse. - Stop that. Shit. What's up? Um... I'm late for a meeting. Okay. Miss Vezi, thank you for coming. I'm sure Wendy's brought you up to speed, so let's get to the point. What did you see? Um... Should I just... Okay. Chris had a party a few weeks ago. This is where I saw Fikile and Coach Chad together. One moment they were arguing... and the next, they were kissing. Are you sure? Do you understand the seriousness of these allegations? Okay. Neither of you can mention this to anyone while we conduct our own investigation. Understood? Yes, Ms. Daniels. Yes, Ms. Daniels. Good. Go back to class. Hey. Why aren't you answering your messages? I was looking for you. I need to tell you something. Sorry, there's just so much to do before we send this thing off to print. Anything I can help with? Nope. So are you and Fikile, like, best friends again? You two need to make up your minds. Yeah, I didn't see that coming. She even apologized. Can you believe that? - So, is that what you wanted to tell me? - No. I was chatting to KB last night about Fikile and her mom, and he said something very strange. And that? And what? Finish your story. Wade, is there something you wanna tell me? Anyway... KB mentioned the fact that Fiks's mom struggled to have kids for a long time. Then boom, all of a sudden, she had Fikile. KB's dad even calls her the miracle child. I thought you didn't care about Fikile anymore. - In fact, I thought you hated her. - I do. You do? - I mean, I did. - You did? I don't know. - Wade, did you hear what I said though? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I did. And there's something else. Wendy's about to turn Fiks's life upside down. How so? She told your mom that Fikile and Coach Chad are sleeping together. What? But... How did she discover that? I might have said something. You just called a truce. I know. I'm sorry. Don't apologize to me. You're better than this, Puleng. That's ridiculous. Is it? These are serious allegations. I know. I can see how our relationship can be misunderstood. We are close, just like any coach is with his star athlete. There's a witness. Said they say you and Fikile kissing at a party. Kissing? So there's nothing going on? No, nothing. Fikile is 17, isn't she? So nothing illegal there if it were consensual. At worst, you'll be dismissed. Maybe never coach again. You think I did this? People tend to lie under these circumstances. So I'm just trying to find the least dramatic way forward, just in case. If you tell the truth up front... I can keep the dismissal discreet. It would spare Fikile a world of trouble. There is nothing happening between Fikile and I. Look, I just wanna know the truth. You know, if Fikile's really my sister. But now everything is just so messed up. If we can just prove that Fikile's mom didn't or couldn't bear children, then that will be enough. Then I'll tell my parents. Well... while you and Fiks are still besties, why don't you ask Fiks about her mom as a start? Otherwise, we'll have to find doctors' records to prove it, and I'm not sure how we're going to do that. I'm not breaking into anyone's house though. - What? - Nope. No. I wish there was another way. Oh, my gosh. What about a baby photo? If she gave birth to Fiks, then surely she'll have, like, a very early photo of her up in the house or in an album somewhere. Then we can compare that photo to the famous photo of Phume. But you'll have to get into their house somehow. You're a genius. That's so doable. Makes me think around the same moment of Phume's abduction, somebody witnessed a woman enter into a taxi with a screaming baby just outside the same hospital. There's even a police sketch of it. Okay, what are you saying? That Fiks's mom might be the woman in the sketch? Scary thought, hey? But, yeah, maybe. I need to speak to Fikile. I'll chat to you later.

Maybe, but I'll organize, so don't stress. Just text me your size. Okay. I'll tell my mom to drop me off at your place, and we'll leave from there. - Is that cool? - Yeah.

You can't really miss what you didn't have. I'm sorry if I'm getting too personal. It's chill. Hey, we should have dinner with my dad. Get to know him better. I don't know. Dinner with the parents, it's a bit too early for that. Oh, calm down. He likes to know my friends. Oh, so we're just friends? Okay, come here. Puleng... Where have you been all my life? You're more than just a friend. Will you please be my girlfriend? Idiot. For now and forever. Lord, bless this food you have gifted us today. Today and for the rest of eternity. Amen. Amen. Just before we eat, I'd like to say something. I am so glad that you're here. It would be great if we could do it more often. I've just been thinking... with all the drama that's happened over the last couple of weeks, that as a family... we need to start making some positive changes. And so, I, uh... I think this is the last year we're celebrating Phume's birthday. She will always be with us, and we will remember her privately in our hearts. But you're right, Puleng. It's time for us to move forward. Because we have so much to be grateful for. Right here, at this table. Well, the dinner's getting cold. Let's dish up. Shall we eat? Please pass me the rice. Ah, ah, ah, ah. Rice first. Thank you. I'm going to ask you one more time. Is there any truth to what your principal has just told me over the phone? Are you and the coach doing things you're not supposed to be doing? Ma, I told you already, nothing happened. You have a lot more to lose if this is true. Tell me the truth right now, my baby. And if you tell me the truth right now... we can manage the situation. You know you can trust me, right? Yeah, I understand. But I have nothing more to say. Okay. ♪ I long it, I really want it, I need it Don't I deserve it? ♪ ♪ Sisterhood, loving companion Am I not worth it? ♪ Oh, yeah, that was cold. What do you want? Uh... - Fikile invited me here today. - I thought the two of you were not... Yes. We're trying to work things out. Hence we're hanging out today. It's Puleng. - Hey. - Hey. Sorry, Mom, I just realized I forgot to tell you Puleng was coming. It's okay, sweetheart. I'll be done in a few minutes. So come in. Thank you. You can go sit over there. Thank you. What are you doing? Um... I was taking a picture of that frame for my... Pinterest board. Pin-interest? Yes, Pinterest. It's an app where you find design inspiration for interests and hobbies. And I really like that frame. Sure. Any baby photos of Fiks? Why? School magazine. I mean, she must've been the cutest baby ever. Of course she was. Unfortunately, her baby pictures are with her grandparents. In the Eastern Cape, where she was born. Anything else? Okay, I'm ready. Let's go. I'll see you, Mama. - We're Ubering. - Okay, sweetheart. - Come on. - Bye.

What? We have to leave already? No, man. I meant we're done working. Now we can chill. Working? How much are they paying you for this? It's a decent bit of content. Three and a half, I think. Thousand? Yikes. Where can I sign up? Uh, firstly, get 20,000 followers, then proceed to bore us with all the minute details of your life. Whatever, Chris. A girl's gotta eat. You hardly even eat, Fiks. Wait, so, what can I get for 638 followers? A pat on the back. Hey. - It's not funny. No, it's not. - It's funny. Now you think you're cool. Come on. Where are you going? Um, I just have to talk to the hotel manager quick. Oh, well... I still need to chat to you about something, so maybe I'll... No, no, no. No, it's fine. Just wait here. Okay? You stay right where you are, young lady. - Hey. - Hey. So I booked a room in the hotel. You should see it. Dude, like, that view is nuts. Why? Isn't this place, like, crazy expensive? Aw, come on. It's not as expensive as you think it is. Wanna see? Yeah, sure. Okay. Fiks, wait. Can we just talk for a bit? How have you been? Not good, obviously. Me neither. How is this happening? Chris's party. Someone saw us. What? I think there's a way we can work around this. I mean, they just have a witness. It's our word against theirs, right? We're gonna need to cool things off. Yeah, I think so too. But for how long? A month? What are you thinking? I'm thinking for good. Maybe we should just cut our losses at this point and move on. Cut our losses? I don't know. I mean, maybe we'll find each other again later on. Did any of it mean anything to you? Of course, Fiks. Come on. But at the first obstacle, you're giving up. It's really complicated. I can't just leave Riley right now. Complicated how? I don't understand. I thought you and Riley were basically over. That's what you said. Riley's pregnant, Fiks. I'm so sorry about all of this. I'm really beginning to doubt that. Who even told Daniels? One of two people, I suspect. - Chris? - He'd never do that to me. Never. Puleng. She was at that party Chris threw for you. Took me a while to figure it out, but she's the one that saw us kissing that night. It's gotta be her. Look, Fiks, I've gotta get going. Riley's gonna be expecting me back soon. Okay. And, like, what's the plan? Like, what if someone catches you? What are you gonna do? Why do you even worry about that? Babe, is everything okay? No, everything's pretty shit right now. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, slow down. Slow down. Whoa. Whoa. Slow down. Talk to us. Chad ended it. He broke up with me. Shit, Fiks. I'm so sorry. It's because you guys got exposed, right? - Oh, fuckin' wimp. - Yeah. He's scared we'll get caught. But there's more. Riley's pregnant. What the fuck? I told you it was gonna end like this. The dude's a douchebag. Chris, easy. Now's not the time. No, and now he's just protecting his own interest. Fuck him, man. You are the victim in all of this. You need to play the victim now. Where's KB? Banging your bestie in the hotel. Why? Chad says Puleng saw us kissing at the party. She exposed us. You said you guys were cool. Yeah, I thought so too. What's that bitch's problem? She's obsessed. I don't know, but I plan to find out. Fuck that. Let's go up there right now and deal with her. No, today's been eventful enough. Just take me home. Puleng's time is coming. Oh, wait. - What? Did I do something wrong? - No. I'm just... I'm not ready... I guess. Yeah, of course. Sorry, I didn't mean to rush you, hey. Um, should we head back down to the others? No, can we just chill by the balcony instead? - Yeah. - Okay. Let me text Fiks. Okay. Puleng... she's acting strange. I saw her going through a bunch of Phume's old articles. In the garage in the middle of the night. That is strange. She found some article and put it in her pocket, but I couldn't quite make out what the article was about. She just seemed very anxious to get it. Why didn't you just ask her? I don't know. It's just she's the one who's been pushing for us to move past this whole Phume thing, for us to let go. And now she's sneaking around behind our backs in the middle of the night? I'll talk to her. Maybe you should also let her know that your court date has been moved forward. She'd want to know. Of course. Sorry, let me just put this thing on silent. I told my parents about us. They don't want you to resign quietly and get away with this. I'm sorry. I suppose this is goodbye. I love you, Chad. Bye. Hey, what's wrong? Chad? You're scaring me. Sorry. You know I love you with everything that I have, right? There's something I have to tell you. I didn't know you did boxing. It's not boxing. What's up? I went to Fikile's house this weekend. No photos. I mean, if she was struggling to bear children and all of a sudden she got pregnant, surely she'd have baby photos of Fikile at home. Her mom says they're at her grandma's house. I don't buy it. So go to the grandmother. They live in another city. Have a look at this. What's this? Those are Fikile's parents. That's KB's dad. The other woman might be KB's mom. I'm not... Ah, the in-laws. Or is he just your... What do they call it? Your fuck buddy? What? No. Don't be... Don't be gross. So, what do you think? I don't think so. Yeah, I thought so too. I don't know. Maybe we should just keep digging this fertility thing then. Me? Look, Puleng, I don't know how much more I can help you with this. Why don't you just tell your parents at this point? I can't. Not yet. I told you, it's complicated. I don't wanna tell them anything until I know for sure that Fikile is... you know, Phume. Then get KB to help you. No, he can't know. I wanna keep this just between the two of us. I didn't even wanna tell you until you caught me with the birth certificate. Come on, Wade, your help means a lot to me. Does it? - Because I'm not really that convinced. - Of course it does. - Why don't you just get it off your chest? - Get what off my chest? I don't know. KB? Okay. I hate that you're spending so much time with him. Remember the night of Chris's party when we hung out for the first time? I felt like there was something between us there. Did you feel anything or was I just imagining it? No. You weren't imagining it. Okay, then, why are you with him? Is it legit or is it just so you can stay close to Fikile? Of course not. I really like him. And me? Well... I like you. And I like doing things for you. I mean, I've broken the rules for you. I even went to Pollsmoor Prison for you. You went to Pollsmoor Prison? Yeah, that doesn't matter. I spoke to Brenda Jaxa, that's just another dead end. But I have to stop. I don't think I can do the... friend zone thing anymore. I'm just... I'm just not that guy. Wade? Thank you. You're welcome. And I'll still help you. I know how much it means to you and your family as well, I guess. So you can send me the pics and I'll keep digging. But that's it. When this is done... we're done. You gonna wait in the car? All right, I won't be long. What happens now? Now, you don't set foot on these grounds again. Ever. From here on out, Fikile's parents will be dealing with you. And Fikile, is she expelled? You've gotta go easy on her. This was my fault. You are in no position to be making requests, Chad. But mandatory counseling will be a start for her. We'll take it from there. That'll be all, Mr. Morgan. Shit. "To his knees, and a sudden breeze scattered light over the platform." He was uncertain whether to stand up or remain sitting. He looked sideways to his left toward the bathing pool. Piggy was sitting near, but giving no help... Excuse me. Can I help you? I'm looking for Fikile Bhele. You have the wrong class. Uh, who... Who are you? - Carry on reading. I'll be back in five. - Who's that? Coach Chad's wife. Good. Let's have a look at this one. Good. Are we all clear on how we got to this answer here? No problems? Good, let's move onto B. - Five x minus... - Fikile Bhele! Fikile! What the fuck? - Hey, hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Calm down. - Are you happy? - Are you happy? - Ma'am, you need to leave! Leave me! I'm pregnant! I'm sorry. I didn't know. My baby's gonna be born into a broken marriage. You sick cunt!

Why don't you ask that traitor bitch girlfriend of yours to notify you? She'll probably know. She's fucking obsessed with Fiks. You do realize all of this is her fault? Is it?

My apologies, Mrs. Bhele. I am the principal of this school. I can only be in one place at a time. Mr. Morgan was in my office handing in his resignation letter. I didn't know his wife was on the grounds. What is this? Are you running a circus? "This case was famous for unveiling a South African arm of a vast network of international adoption corruption." An adoption agency, Point of Grace, was found guilty for being a front for an organized syndicate. They were charged with counts of fraud, corruption, identity theft, blackmail, and political bribery. Point of Grace is now liquidated, and all administrative data has been handed over to the state. Attorney Matla Molapo walks out of court after defending key silent partners in the groundbreaking human trafficking case. Molapo, Fischer, and Associates are cited as representing Point of Grace legally for many years, nearly from its inception in the '90s. Wade, get down here! We've gotta go!
