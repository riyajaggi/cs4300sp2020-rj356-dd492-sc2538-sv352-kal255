It must got to do with Jesus being born. Is Jesus real? Yeah, look, I never met the guy, but... possibly. What about the Easter bunny? No. The tooth fairy? Uh... The tooth fairy's not real either? Mm-mm. What about unicorns? No, unicorns are real. Really? How do you know? - I've seen one. - Where? Blue mountains. So what happened? I was driving. I was driving... through the mountains and um... Yes, I needed to wee. So... when I got out... I could hear this noise. Like, um... you know when a horse runs? That noise. And um... Yeah, I'm standing there, like, on the edge of this clearing. And I can hear this clip-clop noise and it's getting louder and louder. Then I look up... And on the other side of the clearing... there's this unicorn. Were you scared? Actually I was a little bit, yeah. Yeah, so I'm like... standing there and I'm looking at him and he's looking at me... And then he um... he starts smiling at me. Huh. And then he winks at me. He goes like that. And he says... "You take care, Ray." And... then he flew off. Wait. How did he know your name? Unicorn's know everybody's name. Fuck. Dad, $1.
