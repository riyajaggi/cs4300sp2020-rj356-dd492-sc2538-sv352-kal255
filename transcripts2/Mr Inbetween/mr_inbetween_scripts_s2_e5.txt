'Cause it's not bloody easy to quit. It's... addictive. Why? Well, you got this... there's this stuff called nicotine. Now, that's a chemical, all right? And that's in the cigarettes, right? So when you smoke it, you get used to getting that nicotine. So when you stop, the receptors in your brain don't get the nicotine anymore, and they start screaming out, and it makes you go crazy. Well, will you stop for me? Please? All right. - Promise? - Look, I promise you I'll try to quit, okay? I can't guarantee 100% that I can do it, but I'll try, okay?

I need a smoke. - Well, go have one. - Can't. Promised Britt I'd give up. On Christmas Day? Jesus H. - Mm. - Mm. - Okay. Good. - Hey, Ray, ever played Secret Santa before? - No, mate. - Oh, mate, you are in for the time of your life. Okay, the way it works: there's 12 of us in here... there's all the little cards in here - with numbers on 'em, one to 12. - We all know how to play, Dad. Everybody takes a number. Come on, Troy. - Come on in, mate. - Oh, sorry, Pop. You grab a number there. Okay, now, what's gonna happen is that whoever draws number one, they get to go up there first. - There you go, T-Roy. - Thanks, Pops. Number two, they follow 'em up and they get to pick a present as well. Now, here's where it gets interesting. If they don't like their present, - they can swap it with number one. - Yeah. Which means number 12 is the best place to be, okay? Because you get to pick from all the other presents - at the end. - Okay. And here's me. I got number four. - Who's number one? - Aw, that's m... I have it again. Same as last year. Every year. Loser. Oh, Dad! Okay.

What do you want to do, Zo... do you want to swap it? No! No, I don't want to... Aw! Not just one... two! Block your eyes, block your eyes. What is that? Oh. - You got a good one? - Yeah. Oh! Oh! She-Ra! No, that's special. Merry Christmas. Ooh! Dinos. Dino molds. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right, yeah. I'm gonna have to swap. Sorry. - Sorry. - Oh! Oh, that's a beautiful present. Good on ya, mate. And lucky last, number 12... is Trent. - Come on up here, son. - You're the worst. - Come on. - Sounds broken. Is that the... is that the "shake gently" one? - That's the "shake gently" one. - That's-that's... Bet you it's teacups. I bet you it's teacups.

Yeah, I should. Yeah, you should. Hey, you know that, uh... that unicorn candle? - Yeah, it's pretty cool, isn't it? - Yeah. Yeah. Is there any chance you can give it back? Why? Well, me daughter, she's... kind of obsessed with unicorns at the moment. - Yeah. - And, uh, you know, I was hoping maybe, you know, you can give it back and, you know, I'll, uh, throw you 100 bucks or something. You trying to bribe me to give your daughter - the unicorn candle? - I wouldn't say I'm bribing you. More like I'm... asking you a favor, you know? And if you can do it... I'll show a bit of gratitude and throw you some cash. Do I look like I need the money? I don't think you look like you need the money. You know how much I make in a year? Why-why are you being a dickhead? Yeah, I think one of us is being a dickhead. Why the fuck would you take a present off a little kid? You're a grown man. What the fuck do you want with a fuckin' girly candle? Eh, 'cause it's kitchy. It's kitchy? Yeah. Kitchy. Aha. ♪ Hail the new year, lads and lasses ♪ ♪ Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la ♪ ♪ Sing we joyous, all together ♪ ♪ Fa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la ♪ ♪ Heedless of the wind and weather... ♪ Trent, just... I know. - Mum? - Careful, Mum, careful. Okay. Dad, can you get a t... Hey, Dad? What happened with Ally's brother? I think he tripped over or... he had a bit much to drink. - So he was drunk? - Yeah, I think so. How come you took the candle off him? Oh, he didn't really want it, so... Should I give him my present, then? No, you keep it. All right, love. Kiss, kiss. Mwah. All right. - See you. - Bye. - Hey. - Hi. - How was it? - Good. - You have fun? - Yeah. I'm sorry. Yeah. I'm not making excuses, but... Britt caught me smoking this morning, and, um, she made me promise to give up, and I hadn't smoked all day, and... You know? Fair enough. You okay? No. Yeah. Fair enough. What about your bro? How's... Is he all right? How do you think? Mm. So, you know that guy that I was engaged to, yeah? I ended that. We were together for... uh, three years. He had demons, like you. He used to lash out and smash things and punch walls. And then one day he started on me. Then he apologized and told me that he loved me, and... I forgave him. And then a few weeks later, he, um... slapped me. After that, he kicked me, punched me... And every time, you know, he'd say, uh... "I'm sorry." And told me that he loved me. "I'm sorry." And he's-he's not a bad person. I used to tell myself that all the time. He's just... He's damaged, and... I thought that I could save him. And I tried, I really... I really tried. - But I couldn't. - Mm. There's a darkness in you. And I think that's one of the things that attracted me to you in the first place. But now I think... I don't know, I think that... ...the very thing I loved about you... now it scares me. I'll never hit you. That's what he used to say. - And I can't take that chance. - Mm. I can't. I'm sorry. So that's it? Yeah. I'm sorry. So am I. I love you. I do. Know that. And walking away from someone that you love is one of the hardest fucking things in the world to do. Yeah. Well... Yeah. All right. Look after yourself. You too.
