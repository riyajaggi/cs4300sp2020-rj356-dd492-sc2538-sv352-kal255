I think there was a guy behind the fence on the knoll No, but that doesn't make any sense. See, I don't think there was anyone on the grassy knoll behind the fence. I think the shooter was in the pergola. RAY: Where's the pergola? Well, the pergola's on the grassy knoll, but it's-it's up near... more up north towards the depository... It's the big white building, - the-the concrete one. - Mm. Yeah. And, uh... And this ch... and there's a photo... There's two blokes, that are hiding in the pergola, and I reckon that's where the head shots come from. And when the limo comes around the corner, - where does it stop? - Mm? Where does it stop, eh? In front of the pergola. Well, the limo didn't stop. How do you know it doesn't stop? Well, you look at the film, it doesn't. It slows down but it doesn't stop. - On the Zapruder film? - Yeah. Oh. [stammers] Well, that's bullshit because the film's doctored, so... - The Zapruder film is doctored? - Yeah, of course. Yeah. - Who doctored the Zapruder film? - Everyone knows the Zapruder film's doctored... It went missing - for years. And-And then it came back. - I didn't... It resurfaced, like, eight to 12 years later. - Now we're telling more fantasies. - The frames are missing. Yeah. That's right. Well, framesare missing, and... Yeah. It just-it just doesn't make any sense. - It's fucking bullshit. - Mm. So, yeah. You okay, babe? - [whispers]: I want to go home. - Huh? Hey, what made you... why did you shave it off? Your beard. Why'd you shave it off? Well, because, uh, Tat gets pash rash, so... - got to keep her happy. - Oh. - Very nice of you. - GARY: Yeah. You like it? - Yeah. Yeah. - You like it? I do. Uh, it's... Yeah, no, I do. - Actually, I do. - Yeah? - It's good. - Yeah, all right. Okay. There you go. Yeah, you look like an '80s porn star. - Really? - Speaks Russian... What? Babe? You all right? Have you told Ally about you-know-what? What? Your pee-pee movies. (Mutters) I.m gonna kill you. - Pee-pee movies? - [short chuckle] - Oh... yeah. - [laughing]: What the fuck's going on? - Babe, time and a place. - RAY: Nothing. - Nothing? Bullshit. Nothing. - Nothing's going on. - Come on, what? Spill. - Nothing's going on. Come on, Ray. Well, you tell her. - [chuckles] - TATIANA: Last year, Ray left a DVD at our house. [chuckles] Yeah. TATIANA: Yes. And I found it. - Oh... Okay, what was the DVD? - [thump] - Ow! Gary. - What? Golden Shower Power. Oh, right, okay. So we are... we're talking pornos? - Yes. - Yeah, okay. Golden showers? - Mm. - It's when people... piss on each other? - Yes. - Apparently. Yeah. -Okay. ALLY: [chuckles] Wow. Wow, okay. This is like a whole side of you that I have never seen before. [chuckles] - There's a lot you don't know. - I know, clearly. Um... so are you-are you the-the pisser or the pissee? Oh, either's fine. ALLY: So you like the taste of piss, or... RAY: Oh, I don't mind it. - Mm. Okay. - Mm. I need to go to toilet now, so do you want me to wait? I was gonna go, but do you want me to wait 'til we get home, or... Yeah. Yeah, it'd be good if you wait. - All right. - Yeah. You guys have got it sorted out. - RAY: Mm. - ALLY: [laughing]: Mm. - Right. Right, you want another drink? I want to go home. - You want another drink? - Yes, please. You want another drink? Yeah? Get another one. Where's the, uh... It was his DVD, all right? She found it, and he tells her... 'cause he's, you know, I don't know, he panicked or whatever... He tells her, "It's Ray's." And then he comes to me and says, "Man, I need you to come 'round to my house and apologize." Right? Which I did. And say... you know, it's my DVD. [chuckles] Why would you leave a porno - at somebody else's house? - That's what I said to him. Why the fuck would I... Like, not only why would I leave it at your house, but why the fuck would I bring a porno into your... - Like, who comes into somebody's house - [laughing] And you bring a porno with you? You know that I mean? And then you leave it, and, y-you know what I mean? - And you go. - I know. I don't... - It doesn't make any fucking sense. - No. BRITTANY: Dad, why don't you like sandwiches? Uh... I like toasted sandwiches. Just don't like the raw ones, that's all. Why? Uh... I don't know. [mutters] Why do you like them? - Because they're yummy. - Mm. [knocking on door] Who's that? Don't know. - Who is it? - Go to your room. - Why? - Go to your room, please. MALE OFFICER: Afternoon, sir. Are you Ray Shoesmith? I don't answer questions. Can I help you? We're looking for a Ray Shoesmith. Does he live here? I don't answer questions. Okay. Is there somebody here who can answer questions? I don't answer questions. Okay. I don't really know how to respond to that, sir. We just spoke to a woman by the name of Petra Jenkins. She says you threatened her and tried to menace her. - Did she? - Yeah. You got anything you want to sayabout that? I don't answer questions. Would you mind telling us why? I don't answer questions. Okay. See ya. We'll come back later. Okay. FEMALE OFFICER: Friendly chap. MALE OFFICER: That's just weird. [engine starts] - What? - Nothing. ALLY: If something happened to me... like, if I was in... - I don't know... - Like an accident or something, and I was in a wheelchair... would you look after me? Yeah. What if I was, like, a quadriplegic? Is that the ones that can use their arms, but they can't use their legs? No, that's a paraplegic. Quadriplegics can't use their arms or their legs. So, what, you'd just be lying in bed all day? Pretty much. I'd probably put a pillow over your head and put you out of your misery. Serious? Well, why would you want to live like that? What if I wanted to live? Hmm. So how would we have sex? Well, quadriplegics can't feel anything down there. Yeah, but we could still have sex, though, right? So you'd still want to have sex with me even if I couldn't feel anything? Why wouldn't I want to have sex with you? Sure. - Knock yourself out. - [chuckles] Just don't complain I'm a dead root. But you're a dead root anyway and I don't complain. - Thanks very much. - [chuckles] What are you doing? You'll see. [Ray sighs] Aw, is that for me? No, it's for the dude on the park bench over there. There is no dude over there on the park bench. Yes, there is. It's my imaginary boyfriend. He said he'd look after me if I was a quadriplegic. Yeah, well, I said I'd look after you. Oh, good. Just wanted to make sure we weregonna have sex, that's all.

You Taylor? Yeah. I've heard that you've been bullying my friend Brittany. What? You bother Brittany again, and I'm gonna rip your head off. Got it? - Yes. - It's all right? All right. Do you need me to stretch my lips or...? [mumbles] - No, it's okay. - Okay? [mumbles] Do you need me to stop talking? - Yes. - Yeah, okay. Okay. They're very glittery. Am I holding still enough for you? - Yes. - Yeah? All right. - Okay. You want to see? - Yes. Okay. [gasps] Oh. [laughing]: Oh, that's beautiful. Wow, I really like whatyou've done here. This is good. - Thanks. - This is good, yeah. Wow. Thank you. They'll love this at work. Yeah, she's all right now. She was pretty upset, but... I don't think she's gonna have any more problems. Were you bullied at school? Mm-hmm. Bad? Pretty bad. Were you beaten up? Mm-hmm. Well, what was this... All through school? Um... probably up until about... halfway through grade six. - Well, it stopped? - Mm-hmm. Why did it stop? Fought back. What happened? Oh, there was this little prick, and he'd been bullying me for about two years. And, um... ...this one day, you know, we were playing downball, and he just started getting stuck into me, and, you know, and I started crying, and... and he just kept following me, just kept saying shit to me, - just wouldn't leave it alone, you know? - Mm. And I just grabbed him and threwhim up against a wall, and... ...just beat the absolute fuck out of him. And he stopped? He sure did. It's always better to give than receive. Is it? Fuck yeah. Why do you say that? Well, you got to fight back, you know? Otherwise... Otherwise what? Otherwise, people will walk all over you. You know? I mean, that's the thing. Look, I wasn't looking for trouble as a kid. You know? But I learned there's people in this world who will take and take till there's nothing left of you. I used to get angry about it. Well, I... I used to get angry at myself, 'cause I couldn't do nothing about it. - You know what I mean? - Mm. Like, I felt... I felt like I was weak. You know what I mean? Um... I can remember... I took a razor blade out of the, um, the bathroom cupboard. I went down to the swings at the end of the street. And I'm sitting there and I'm thinking, you know, "I'm gonna top meself." You know? "I've had enough." 'Cause I was getting hit at home, I was getting hit at school, you know? And, um... But I couldn't do it, you know? And then, I felt like, "Geez, you weak bastard, you can't, you know, you can't even kill yourself." You know what I mean? And I thought, "Is it 'cause I don't want to die or is it 'causel'm just afraid to cut myself?" So I took the razor blade and I cut me hand up.
