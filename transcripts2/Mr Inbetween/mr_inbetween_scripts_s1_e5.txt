Oh, get the fuck out of here. Are you fucking kidding me? He's a cop? Yes. He's a cop. Oh, Jesus Christ. What did you do? We let him go. What's he got on you? Oh... fuck all, really, but, you know. - Huh? - Ah. Think yourself lucky. I... Thank you. Thank you. I owe you big time, my friend. Yep. And you still owe me money, too. Yeah, I do, I do still owe you that money, but I'll, ah, have that to you in another week. Sure. - Catch ya, Phil. - Yeah, see you, mate. Oi! Get across. Quick, quick, quick, quick! Move, move, move! Get over! Get over. Hurry the fuck up, get across! Right, bring your hands over here so I can cuff ya. Other one, other one, other one. I'll hang onto that. So how much would it take for you to let me go, you reckon? More than you got. Well, how much you got, Ray? More than you're making on this fuckin' job, - I'll tell you that much, mate. - Is that right? Yeah. Well, how much more? 162,000 bucks. Fuck off. Fair enough. - Bullshit. - Alright. What the fuck are you doing with that kind of money? I'm a hard worker. And where is it, then? You know who Glen Davis is? Other side of the Blue Mountains there? So what's it doing there? Well, it's not doing much at the moment, mate, so uh... might as well go get it, eh? So what, we go get the money and then we let you go, Ray. Is that it? Yep. Keep your fucking head down, Ray. Bobby, get out of the car. - Put your gun away. - Right. Not in there, you fucking moron. So what do you reckon? About what? You heard what he said. - Yeah. - Yeah, so? So you wanna go and get the money. Yeah, I wanna go get the fucking money. Yeah, but we gotta meet like Davos first. - And... - Davros. - Yeah. - Yeah. Yeah, no, no, no, no. We'll still do that after we get the money. We get the money first, we drop him off to Davros, everyone's fucking happy. Yeah, but... but we gotta... - to be there, so... - You just tell Davros that we run out of fucking petrol. - He'll be fucking pissed, though, Dave... - Yeah, no, no, we'll just tell him it's a fuckin'... wasn't our fault that the fuel gauge is fucked. Yeah, no. I don't know, man. What the fuck is wrong with you? It's $160,000. You don't want 80 grand? Of course. Like... like 80 grand could come in handy. - Oh, you fucking think so? - Yeah. Imagine the shit you can buy for 80 grand. Yeah, a new car would be nice, hey. Wouldn't it be fucking nice? - Yeah. - Yeah? What do you like? You like Holdens or Fords? - Holden, mate. Holden. - Holden? Yeah. For 80 grand you could buy a really fucking nice Holden, right? A Commodore. HSV, club sport, all the bells and whistles. Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Are we good? - Yeah. - So we'll go get the money, eh? - Yeah. - Get in the fucking car. - Right. All right, Ray. This is what's gonna happen. We're gonna go get this money. And then we're gonna let you go. If that money ain't there, I don't give a fuck if it's $20 less than you said it is, then I'll put a fucking hole in you. - Fair enough. - Fair enough. Mm-hmm. Yeah, nah, nah, she's eating all kinds of crazy shit. How far along is she? Eight months. Boy or a girl? Boy, thank fuck. What's wrong with girls? I got a girl. Yeah, well, fucking you know. Better you than me. So what's the problem? - So how old's your little girl? - Eight. Okay, so, she's eight years of age. Right now she's really sweet and she's innocent and all that but anyway, one day she's gonna grow up, like she's not gonna be so fucking sweet and innocent, you understand? Well, she's not innocent all the time... Well, okay. Most of the time she's sweet and innocent. - Right. - But at some point, like I said, she's gonna grow up, and she's gonna... mate, she's gonna be... she's gonna be sucking a cock. Okay? Do you understand what I'm saying? Where I'm coming from? Yeah, I understand where you're coming from. And I'll probably kill her first couple of fucking boyfriends, but... you get over it, mate. No, I don't think you fucking get over it. - You get over it, mate. - Yeah. - Jesus Christ. - Anyway, fuck, you can have the girls, I'll have the boys. Okay. So what are you going to call him, anyway? Quentin James. What the fuck is... what is that? You're worried about your kid sucking dicks and you're gonna call the kid Quentin? Mate, Quentin's a good name. That was my grandfather's name. You don't like Quentin? Yeah, your granddad's name. Was he gay? No, he wasn't fucking gay. Why don't you call him John or something? Give him a fucking bloke's name. Quentin is a bloke's name. A gay bloke's name. Yeah. - Good one. - Get fucked. Fuck you. Name one bloke that you know called Quentin who's a blokey bloke. I don't know any Quentins, all right? I don't know any Quentins except my grandfather. That's one of the reasons I... it's an original name. - It's an original, strong fucking name. - Yeah, right. Okay, one man from history, one bloke, in history, who's a blokey bloke, called Quentin. Ah, fuck. See? Okay, all right. Remember... okay, probably not a blokey bloke but if you're gonna talk about, like, courage... remember that little fucking Quentin from... from Willesee? He was in his... you know, he was fucking all crumpled up and fucking the little blond-haired kid, used to come on Willesee, make the fucking cunt cry. That poor little bastard couldn't eat a fucking Tim Tam without breaking his fucking fingers. - Not a blokey bloke, though... - Not a blokey bloke, but, mate, was in a movie, wrote a book, he fucking... mate, one year they put him in a fucking... in a celebrity car race. They propped him up on some books and he raced the fucking car, like at fucking good speeds. Hmm. Yeah, no, ah, you know. I mean he's not a blokey bloke. I mean you got a point but, yeah. Yeah, I absolutely got a fucking point. It's a fucking good, strong name. Yeah. - This it here, Ray? - Hurry up. Yeah? - Yeah, back door. - All right. Ah, fuck ya. Come on. Come on, come on. Yeah, I'm going the best I can, mate. Hey. Where is it, Ray? We ran out of petrol. 'Cause the fuel gauge on this car's fucked. Sneaky fuck. Yeah, so, we... ah, we're walking into town now, but I don't know what the town is, so, yeah. But as soon as we get some, uh... So what's the combo, Ray? Don't know. What do you mean you don't know? I've got it written down, but... Where? At home. Well, how am I supposed to open the fucking thing, Ray? Oxy cutter? Oxy cutter. I'll just, what, pull one out of my arse, will I? Come here, you. Come on. You know, you should have said something, Ray. 'Cause it's starting to feel like you're trying to pull some funny shit. Mate, all you gotta do is cut the fucking thing open. I don't know what you're whingeing about. No, no, I'm not whingeing, cunt. Well, it sounds like it. You gotta go fucking ten minutes up the road, go to a hardware store, get an oxy cutter, job's done. Yeah, all I'm telling you is this, all right? You better not be trying to fuck me around. - That's all I'm saying. - Yeah, mate, yeah. I came out and put the box in the fucking house just to fuck you around. Get in. - You want me to get in there? - Yep. Who's whingeing now? Come on. Stay in the car. Just that, thanks, mate. You got eye protection? No, I'll be all right. You used one of these before?
