Well, my family are going to my folks for lunch... - Yeah. - ... and I was wondering if you and Bruce and Britt... wanted to come. Yeah, I'll ask Brucey. But Britt and I will definitely come. Okay. - Girls, you want an ice cream? - Yeah! - Yes. - Yeah, that's a surprise. - Let me get a scoop of chocolate. - Right. Two scoops. Why not? Fill it up. - Two? - Yeah. And there you go. Thank you. - Uh, excuse me? - Yeah? I asked for two scoops. Oh, yeah, there's two scoops there. How come they're the same size, then? See? Well, there's one scoop in this cup, right? - Yeah. - And two scoops in this cup? - Yeah. - So how come they're the same size, then? Oh. No, sorry, I... There-There's as much in this one as this one. Right, I pushed the two scoops down more so that they'd both fit into the cup. - Just don't worry about it. - What? It's a fucking rip-off. I put the same-size scoops in there. You put the same-size scoops in there? - Yes. - I don't fucking think so, mate. Look. Scoops. Same height. Mm-hmm. Yeah, um, like I was saying, I pushed it down, so... Two scoops. Yeah, yeah. - One still should be bigger. - Mm-hmm. If you're n... if you're not happy... - Give me two scoops. - Okay. Fucking wrong with this guy. - Deaf or something. - I'm really sorry about that. There's another scoop. All right, that's better. You get what I mean, right, about the scoops? Oh, yeah, totally. It's completely fine. - Yeah, all good. - Mm-hmm. All right, let's go. You got a problem, mate? Yeah, mate. Would you like one, would you? Well, come on. - Let's go. - Ray. - Huh? - It's not worth it. - Well, come on. - Eh... Yeah, that's what I thought. Fag. Uh, what do you want, girls? - What flavor? - Eh? What do you want? - Uh... - I want salted caramel. - Salted caramel? - Yeah. I want mint choc chip. - Mint choc... that's my favorite. - Yeah. - How many scoops you want? - Have a good night. Dad? - Oh. God. Oh! Sorry, it's... - Don't hit Ally! No, darling, it's okay. It's okay. It's, um... - We're okay. We're just... - Why were you hitting her? - No, no, no, no. It's okay. - I... I wasn't hitting. - No... - I wasn't. I wasn't. No, we're just mucking around, love. - Um... - Just-just... just mucking around, - just playful. And it's all right. - What were you doing? Um... We were having sex. Oh, Jesus. Um, has Mum had the birds and the bees chat with you, love? - What? - The sex talk. Has Mum talked to you about sex? - No. - Okay. Well, we... We'll... we'll... We'll have a talk about it, okay? Why don't you just go to your room, and we'll... ? I'll come in in a minute, all right? Just give us a minute. Ah, man. Mm. Jesus Christ. Fucking heart attack. Oh... Okay. So... When a man and a woman love each other, all right, they have sex. Okay? So, um... ... when they have sex, the man puts his penis... - You know what a penis is? - Dad. Okay. So, the man takes his penis, and he puts it inside the woman's vagina. What? Why? Well, 'cause that's how you make a baby. So, do you know what, um... do you know what testicles are? - Balls? - Mm. Balls, yeah. Okay. So, in the man's balls, there's things called sperm. - Okay? - Okay. And they're kind of like, um, like little fish. - Fish? - Mm. No. Nah, they're more like, um, tadpoles. You've got tadpoles in your balls? They're kind of like tadpoles, but they're smaller. - Mm. - Okay? So, anyway, when the man and the woman have sex, right, the sperm... the little tadpoles... swim out of the man's penis, right, and go into the woman's vagina. And then they swim up into... the woman's... tummy. Mm. There's an egg. Where there's an egg there. - An egg? - Yeah. No, it's... it's not a... it's not a hard egg. It's not like... Not like a chicken egg. It's-it's a soft egg. And there's, like, millions of these sperm, okay? So, the sperm that swims the fastest out of all those millions, right, is the first one that gets to the egg, and that's the one that makes the baby. So, when you were a sperm, you swam the fastest. So, if I was the fastest sperm, how come I'm not a good swimmer now? Um... - Well... - Wait. So, hang on. I came from your balls? Half of you came from my balls. Half-half of you came from my balls, and the other half came from your mum's tummy. That's weird. Mm. So, are you gonna make a sister for me? Uh, no, we're not planning to. No. Why are you doing sex, then? Um... 'cause it feels nice. Gross! It's not that bad. It's a bit gross. ♪ Lights out... ♪ How you going, love? G'day. What can I do you for? Just a couple of dimmies. Thanks, love. Okay. So, how's your day going? It's all right. How's yours? Oh, you know. Same old, same old. - Yeah. - Boring. There you go. That's $6.80, thanks. - Keep the change, love, all right? - Aw, thanks. ♪ Together we'll get through ♪ ♪ I don't have the time... ♪ ♪ I promise, baby, you ♪ ♪ Hold on to me tight ♪ ♪ I'm hanging by your side... ♪ Here we go.

Oh, okay. Yeah. I went through there a few years ago. Nice, uh... It's got a good feel to it. Yeah, it's nice. It's got a real community feel about it, which I like. Yeah, well, you don't get much of that around here, do you? No, you don't. Mm. I lived in St Kilda for many years, and there's very little community spirit there, - I can tell you. - Mm. Mm. Mm. We better get going. Oh, shit. Yeah. Um, we got to pick up my sister from work, so... Actually, Mum, um, me and Ray... we've got to r-rehearse for an audition I've got. - Oh, another one? - Yeah.
