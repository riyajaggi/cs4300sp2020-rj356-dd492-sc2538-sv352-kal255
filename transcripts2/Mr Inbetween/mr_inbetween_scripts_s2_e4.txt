 I used to make friends with them and talk to them and all that kind of stuff. Why don't you try that? Okay. But don't give them, like... don't give them scary names, give them funny names. Like what? Well, I used to have one that used to live under my bed. I used to call him Gus. - That's funny. - Mm-hmm. See, and if it's funny, then you're not gonna be so scared of them, you know? Yeah. Okay.

 All right. You get some sleep, eh? Hmm? You gonna stay under there all night, are you? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Night-night. - Good night. What's that? You never had basmati? - No. - That's Indian rice. It's, uh, it's really long grain. You got to try it. Where do you get that from? Oh, just at the n... Fuck! - Jesus. - Kill the fucking thing, will ya? - Fucking relax, mate. Jeez. - Kill it! I don't come cheap, mate, so, uh... Yo... You fucking smart-ass. I'll give you 50 bucks. - Just kill it. - They're harmless. Mate, I just had a double heart attack here, okay? So I don't really think you can say that they're harmless. They can't hurt you. Well, it's hurting me right now, psychologically. I nearly had a bloody heart attack. You know what you need to do? - You need to kill it. - No. What you need to do... - is face your fears. - Oh, yeah, fuck that shit. - Come on. - What are you doing? - Come on. - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. What are you doing? What are you doing? - Come here. - Ray, Ray, no! Hey! Ray! I'm not... No! Hey! I'm not... Don't! I'm not messing around, dude. Dude, when have you ever heard of a huntsman ever fucking hurting anybody? Yeah, I don't... Well, I'm sure they hurt people. Probably kill people, too. - Oh, they kill people, do they? - Yeah. Oh, okay. Yeah. Well, you imagine some old lady, she's at home, right? She looks up, there's a massive huntsman, right? She has a heart attack. She dies. A week later, they find her. The fucking huntsman's gone. The paramedics come in. They say, "Oh, heart attack. Natural causes." But it wasn't natural causes, was it? It was a dirty, great hairy fucking huntsman. Yeah, y-you think it's funny. They're probably responsible for killing more old people in this country, and we don't even know about it. - Freddy, Kim is here to see you. - Okay. - Thanks, love. I'll be right out. - Okay. Just kill it, will you? I don't kill bugs, mate. Oh, you don't kill bugs, you just kill people? I got to draw the line somewhere. Uh, you all right? No, I'm not all right. Shield me from it or something, will you? - Don't let it fucking jump. - Okay. Okay. Oh, look at the size of it. - Come on. - That thing'd eat ya. Don't! You mongrel bastard. So, uh, why don't you tell Ray your story, mate? Okay, uh... my daughter, uh, Jenny... she went missing in '95. And, uh... we never, um... The cops... We nev-we never found out what happened to her. Uh, so, um... The cops, uh, were looking at this one guy, uh, - as a suspect. - Mm. And one of the cops that I was... had most of the dealings with... um, he was convinced that this guy, um, a guy called Dennis Miller... ... uh, he was convinced that he knew something, you know? And he was involved, but the cops couldn't get enough, uh, hard evidence to charge him, you know. And this guy, Miller, he was a convicted... He was convicted of, uh... fiddling with kids. And he did some, uh, some time in jail. And, uh... With the wife and me, all these years... it's been hard, mate. Um, just the not knowing what happened to Jenny. And the thing is, uh, I got, uh... uh, liver cancer, and I don't have that long, so I just need someone, uh, to go and talk to this guy. And, uh, I just want to know what happened to my Jenny. And, um, I don't want to, uh... I don't want my wife not knowing, and I don't-I don't want to leave this world not knowing. And I'd love to be able to tell my wife what happened. And, uh, look, it might be asking too much, but, um... You see, we-we... we never got to bury her. We never got to close the book. If you could, uh, find out what he did with her, like, her remains... Just so... we can just visit her. How old was she? Thirteen. Smells good. Can I help you? I hope so. You normally just go walking into people's houses? What'd you do with Jenny Greer? You better get out of here, or I'll call the cops. I'm serious. Look, t... I don't want any trouble, okay? Oh, I don't want any trouble, mate. I don't know this Jenny... whatever you said her name was. - Greer. - Okay, Greer. Uh-huh. Take those. Put 'em on. What-what... - Put 'em on. - Okay. So, Jenny's dad... wants to know what happened to her. I don't know. He doesn't want the cops involved, so you're not gonna get into trouble. He just wants to know what happened to her, right? And he wants her remains. So you tell me what I want to know, and I'll get the fuck out of here, and you'll never see me again, okay? Swear to God, I don't know anything. I-I've got money. I don't want your money. I swear to God, I don't know where she is. Yeah, you said that. What are you gonna do? Whatever it takes, mate. Come on. - Come on. All right? - No! Ow! It's pretty good, mate. What's the herb you got in there? - Basil. - Basil? Lovely. All right. You seem like an okay sort of a bloke, mate. And I don't want to hurt you. So just tell me what I want to know, and I'll get out of your hair. I really would-would like to help you, but... ... y-you got the wrong guy, mate. I mean, I... I know with my... I know I did some bad things in the past, but... I swear, I-I didn't do... I don't know this Jenny. I tried to be nice, mate, all right? You want some more, mate? Where do you want it? Where do you want it? The Otford railway tunnel! Otford. That's where she is. Where in the tunnel? I don't know, exactly, but... ... that's where I put it. It? Her. That's where I put her, I mean. I swear to God. You believe in God, do you? Right here, left. Look ahead. You look at me again, I'll put one in your head. Help me get this out the way. Okay. You help me get this out? Oh... Is he in there? Do you know the pain that you've caused? I'm sorry. Thank you.
