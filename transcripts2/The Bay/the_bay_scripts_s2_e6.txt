 Is Breakwater a front for drugs? Could this be why Stephen Marshbrook was murdered? And are his death and Med's connected? You stupid, stupid idiot! And what aren't the family telling us? Did Stephen ever mention any discrepancies in the company accounts? He was just being paranoid. - So why did you come back? - Because of Oliver. He's my son. She's nothing to do with that family. Because they're toxic, that's why.

 - What if he's changed? - He hasn't. His mum died three years ago. I do like someone. It's you. - Ellen. - I want a divorce, Tony. I'll be there as soon as I can. We've got CCTV, an e-fit, two eyewitnesses, a matching tattoo. It's in your own interest to tell us what happened. No comment. You can "no comment" all you like, mate, - you're not walking away from this. - No comment. OK. We have been speaking to our colleagues in the Metropolitan Police and they have been in touch with the Russian authorities.

 There's a warrant for your arrest for a murder in 2016 in the city of Grozny. So, you can talk to us or you can talk to them. OK. We'll contact our colleagues. I'm sure they'll be keen to speak to you. OK. OK, what? I was hired... ...to kill Stephen Marshbrook. Hey... - Hey... - Oh! - Hey, how did it go? - I didn't say you could stay. - Sorry, I just, er... - I've been at work all night. I need to have a couple of hours' kip, a shower and get back to work. - So, you need to go. - Yeah, sure. Shh...! Don't wake the kids. OK, OK. Only, I don't know. You know, maybe we should talk to them. I mean, not now, but... I just mean, with you being so busy, and me being around a bit more, maybe I could help out. You know, like, what if I was to make dinner tonight? Just dinner. I... I don't know, we'll see. Just... He must've scarpered, tail between his legs. OK. - Er, see you. - Yeah. - Tony, I... - No, no, it's OK. I'm not looking for a row. I brought these. Thank you. No, it's, erm... Look... ...Ellen, I'm sorry. For everything. I'm sorry I, er... ...messed things up. - I'm sorry I let you down. - Don't. No, but it... It's true, though. I wasn't really here. Even when I was here. It wasn't all bad, though. Was it? Shut up. We've got two brilliant kids. We must have been doing something right. Yeah. Come here. Have you got that new English teacher later? Yeah. She's dead funny, you know. Have you had her yet? - No, not yet. - Oh, she's actually nice. Hiya! What was that about? I don't know. It doesn't matter. You need to talk to him. I don't want to be the cause of you falling out with your best mate. Right, listen up! We've had a breakthrough. Lisa, Karen... So, yesterday, police in Manchester picked up this man. He's a Russian national. His name is Viktor Zima. And he has now confessed to the murder of Stephen Marshbrook. - But why? - Well, all that he will tell us is that he was hired by a bloke that he met in a pub. He didn't get his name, he was paid in cash. He's really sketchy about these details, right? So, he said he's aged somewhere between his 20s and his 40s. - That doesn't exactly narrow it down. - No. So, this pub was in Moss Side, some time in the middle of April. We've narrowed it down to the week commencing the 15th. So, we're collecting CCTV footage from all the pubs in the area. Yeah, and this is also around the time that Jamie and Theo arrived back in the country. I should add, though, that Zima has a rock-solid alibi for the day Med died. But it doesn't mean he's not linked to Breakwater. No. Right, Stu, Eddie, get on to that. See if you can find the connection. And let's keep looking into Madeline Hookway, too. Just because Zima said it was a bloke, it doesn't rule her out. She has a motive. Lisa, I'll need you to talk to her later. But for now, tell the family that we've made an arrest, but no more than that. No names. And given what Zima's said, we need to account for Jamie, Theo and Mark. So, I just want to check your movements around the middle of April. So, it's the week starting the 15th. I was in the office all week. Apart from the 18th. OK. Where were you then? I had a meeting in Manchester. Hamblyn & Cook. Not a crime, is it, to visit Manchester? Lisa, why are you asking this? Er, because there's been a development. We have arrested a man in connection with Stephen's death. Who? Who is it? I can't tell you that. All I can say is that we've made an arrest. Well, at least we can start to get our lives back. Get back to work. Bill, sorry. The freezing of the company's assets, that's part of a separate investigation. It's not directly related to Stephen's murder. That's ridiculous! - Look, Dad... - Oh, bollocks to this! The hell with it, I'm going to work. Oh, come on now, Bill... No, get out of my way. I've got work to do. Dad...! - Sorry. - It's OK. Just let him go. Where did you get those keys? Just shut up! Dad, come on, give me the keys. Is it him? The man you've arrested. Is it the man who shot Dad? We think so. Why did he do it? We don't know that. Not yet. I got a letter. From Madeline's solicitor. OK. She's going for custody. Rose, I'm sorry. Will you help me? Look, I'm your FLO. I'm here to support you in any way I can. But Madeline might have a genuine case. You have to prepare yourself for that. OK. Hey! What are you doing here? - Are you bunking off school? - No, I've got a free period. And I've got a permission slip. Do you want me to prove it? No, you're all right. I believe you. Thousands wouldn't. What is it? What's up? I've been thinking about what you said about Dad. And? I'm not going to say anything to Mum. I don't think it's fair. It's just, it's been kind of nice having him around. Love, we don't know anything about him. We don't know why he's back and we don't know where he's been. He's been in Stoke. I talked to him. He told me everything. Honestly, Gran, just give him a chance, please. I'd better get back to school. You haven't got a free period. You haven't got a permission slip! Nah, I bunked off, didn't I? Have you ever met this man? No. Who is he? This man's been arrested for Stephen's murder. - Do you know this man, Madeline? - No. We know that somebody hired this man to kill Stephen. I have only ever been trying to get access to Oliver. And why would I do anything to jeopardise that? Even after everything Stephen did to me, I would never put Oliver through that. Lisa, Karen, have a look at this. Uniform just sent this over from Moss Side. The landlady remembers Zima. We were able to narrow down the dates. And bingo! Thursday the 18th. - There he is. - Yeah, but wait for this. At 20:58, he's joined by this man. Oh, my God...! I know who that is. That's Frank Mercer. What do we know about Frank Mercer? What did you make of him? Er, he didn't give much away. But he knows the family. He went to school with Mark. And Mark was in Manchester that week. Frank was very protective of Grace. He felt that she'd been badly treated. Well, we need to bring them both in, too. Grace and Mark. Yeah. Erm... - Look, I just wanted to say... - Oh, don't. - No, you don't have to. - No, no, but I do, though. I just wanted to say thanks. Thanks for, er... ...looking after me. Yeah, no worries. It's not going to happen again. I'm, er... I'm getting my shit together. I can't remember things too clearly, but that... That was Andy, right? The Andy. - I didn't know you were still... - We're not. We're not... ...still anything. Right. - So, what...? - I don't know. I don't know. Honestly. Fair enough. Mark... Are you all right? The company is going tits up. The police are poking into every corner. They are not going to give up. Look, I know this is not what we wanted. But what if this is the chance for us to start again? Away from here. Away from the family. I could sell the salon. We could... ...just set ourselves up somewhere. Start again. - We can't, though. - Why not? We can't just leave. Why not? What about Dad? Who's going to look after him? Rose will still be here. Love, do you not think Rose has got enough on her plate? Stella... Stella, Stella, I'm sorry. But we can't leave. I can't leave. I'm sorry. And I need you. I know. Oi! It's one way! One way! Hello? Oi, it's one way! Are you all right? Are you all right, love? Are you all right? I'll call you back, mate. - What is going on? - Grace, I'll handle it. What can I do for you? Frank Mercer, you're under arrest for conspiracy to murder Stephen Marshbrook. - No. No way. - You do not have to say anything, but it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something which you later rely on in court. Anything you do say may be given in evidence. You're making a mistake here. Do you understand? Yeah. Grace, if you could come with me, please. I'd like you to come to the station and just answer a few questions. Can you get in the car with me, please? Thank you. Dad? Dad! What happened? A lot of fuss about nothing. I still think you should come with us, get properly checked out. I'm fine. I don't need to go to hospital. Dad, you should listen to them. They know what they're doing. Don't you start. You're as bad as them. Come on, let's get you home. Here... I can still walk! I'm sorry. I'm sorry, son. - Sorry. - No. No, it's fine. No. Breakwater. I didn't know what they were doing with those properties. I didn't want to know. And I knew not to ask questions. I'm sorry. It's OK. It's OK, Dad. I'll handle things from now on. Come on, let's go home. Do you recognise this man? No. What about now? Are you going to tell us who it is? Just some bloke I met in the pub. - Just some bloke? - I'd had a few pints. I can't even remember. Only, it's not just some bloke you met in the pub, is it, Frank? Because this man... ...Viktor Zima... ...has confessed to the murder of Stephen Marshbrook. Well, I don't know anything about that. He wouldn't do something like this. He just wouldn't. - How long have you known him? - Five years, something like that. He's like family. He's the only family I've had for the last five years. Because your own family... Kicked me out, yeah. Turned their backs on me. Tell me about your dad, Grace. What kind of a man was he? What kind of a dad? - Why? - Because everybody I speak to paints a different picture of him and I'd like to know what yours is. I hadn't seen him for a really long time. And the last time I did see him, we didn't... ...exactly part on the best of terms. It was different when I was little. He was different. It changed when I got bigger. He always wanted to know who I was with, where I was going, what I was doing. That sounds like most parents. There were all these... ...rules. Did that make you angry? I didn't want him killed, if that's what you mean. He was my dad, for God's sake! How did you meet Frank, Grace? How did you end up working at the scrapyard? Through my mum. She talked to Frank, put a word in for me. - He's just through here. - Thank you. Are you OK, Bill? What's happened? Oh, it's nothing. I pranged the car, that's all. Lisa, what is it? What are you doing here? I wanted a word with you, Rose, if that's OK. Can you just step outside? Er... Right, I didn't really want to ask in front of the family because it's a bit delicate. It's about the money, isn't it? The money that was taken from the company. I know that the police have been looking into the accounts. What do you know about that money, Rose? It was me. I took it. OK, Rose... Before you say anything else, I need to arrest you now. I'm arresting you on suspicion of theft from the company of Bradwell & Marshbrook. You do not have to say anything, but it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something that you later rely on in court. Do you understand? This is bloody ridiculous. You can't do this. I don't give two shits about the money. Mark, if you could come with us as well. We just need to ask you some questions, please. What? What questions? - It's OK, love. - No! Of course it's not bloody OK! OK, tell us about the money, Rose. Er... It was just small amounts. I needed something for me. Just for me. What did you do with the money? Nothing. Just knowing that it was there, sitting in the account, was enough. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I should have told you earlier, but... ...I was ashamed. Mark, how well do you know Frank Mercer? I knew him years ago. At school. Why? Was it him you arrested? You didn't seem best pleased to see him when he came to the house. This is... What? He was an arsehole, all right? When we were kids, he made my life a misery. So, no, I wasn't best pleased to see him. This is footage from a cash machine just around the corner from the pub. You withdrew ?400. Not a crime, is it? CCTV then caught you meeting Zima to hand something over. It looks like cash. What was the money for, Frank? Work. - What kind of work? - Just scrap, salvage. I thought he was just some bloke you met in the pub. The thing is, Frank, we've talked to Viktor Zima... ...and he's identified you as the man that paid him to kill Stephen Marshbrook. He's a liar. First, you tell us you don't know him. Then, you tell us you paid him for work. And Zima's told us exactly what kind of work that was. What did you have against Stephen Marshbrook? Was it something to do with Mark? Why would it have anything to do with that twat? - Was it because of Grace, then? - No. Well, if it had nothing to do with Mark, and nothing to do with Grace, why did you do it? So, I want to ask you... ...how well do you know Frank Mercer? Er, why? Can you just answer the question, please? I hardly know him at all. Well, I haven't seen him for years. He came to the house, didn't he, the other day? You spoke to him then. Oh, er... Apart from that. Er, I meant. Rose, we've been speaking to Grace. So, we know that you got Grace the job at the scrapyard. So, I'm just wondering how you managed to do that if you hadn't seen Frank in years. Rose, I have to tell you that we have arrested Frank Mercer in connection with Stephen's murder. What? The killer has identified Frank as the man who hired him. But we need to know why he did it. So, I need you to help me with that. I need you to help me to understand. I... I don't understand myself. OK, I'm going to ask you one more time. How well do you know Frank Mercer? We went to school together. He's younger than me, so I didn't know him well. And then he went off to the Army. I didn't see him for years. And five years ago, something like that... ...I bumped into him. He'd come back and... ...we got talking. And he was easy to talk to. He... He'd listen to me. He actually listened to me. He was interested in me. I didn't mean for anything to happen. - It just did. - OK. - So, you were having an affair? - Well, no. We didn't see each other that often. I mean, it wasn't easy with work and family, but... Yes. Yes. Frank, I have to tell you that a 48-year-old woman... ...is helping us with our inquiries. And she's proving very helpful. Very co-operative. She had nothing to do with this. Who? Rose. OK. OK, talk me through this, Frank. Tell me what happened. I went to meet him. I paid him. Now, I don't know what she's saying, I don't know what she's telling you, but she had nothing to do with it. She had no idea what I was doing. Did Stephen know about the affair? No. No-one knew. Did you tell Frank about the money you stole from the firm? No, we didn't talk about it. Did you tell him that Stephen was looking into these thefts? No. Why would I tell him that? Maybe because you wanted him to do something about it. Because you were frightened of Stephen finding out. Rose, did you conspire with Frank to have Stephen killed? No! How can you ask me that? It was obvious, she wasn't happy, Rose. I mean, she hadn't been happy for years, but... ...it got worse. Because of him. I mean, he had everything that you could want. A family of his own, a nice house, a good job. And he didn't appreciate any of it. He didn't deserve any of it. And I tried to tell her. I told her so many times, "Just leave him, just walk. "We'll be fine. We'll be fine on our own. "I'll look after you." But she wouldn't. It was like he had this... ...hold over her. So, I thought... ...I had to do something. I thought, "I have to make this happen. "So that we can get away. "So we can have a life together." Rose, did you plan to leave Stephen with Frank? Is that what you were saving the money for? No! I would never have left Oliver. Never. Were you planning on taking him with you, the three of you? You, Frank and Oliver. I thought, after a while... ...we could start again. The three of us. - The three of you? - Me, her and Oliver. So, child abduction, on top of everything else. Conspiracy to murder not enough for you? It's not abduction. He's her son. You were never going to be able to play happy families, Frank. Because Oliver is Stephen's biological son. But he's not Rose's. She's not his legal guardian. She raised him. But he's Stephen's son. And now a man's dead. And one of my officers was murdered investigating the killing that you paid for. Two men. Two families... ...shattered. Kids traumatised. Because of you, Frank. Frank was just... It was just a fantasy. It was just an escape. He used to paint these pictures of us, of our lives together, and... He used to talk about Spain and me, him, Oliver playing happy families. And it was just fun. And it was just... It was just nice to dream. But... ...it was never real. I never promised him anything, I swear. I swear. I would never have taken Oliver away from his dad. He loved his dad. It would've broken his heart. Can I see her? Can I talk to her? I would never have left Stephen. Never. Why not? It... Because I loved him. Rose Marshbrook, will you accept a caution for the crime of false accounting and theft, contrary to Section 1 of the Theft Act, 1968? Please, can you sign here to acknowledge what I've just said to you? Yeah. - So, what happens now? - That's it. You're free to go. - Can I drive you home? - No, I'm good. I'll walk. OK. Josh... What? I just want to see if you want to... ...hang out, go to the cinema or something. Why? Because we're mates. And that's the type of thing mates do. - Rob... - But we are mates, though. That's... That's the thing and... ...that's never going to change. Rob... Look, and it took a lot of guts to tell me what you said and... I'm sorry, I can't. I'm not... The thing is, are we OK? Rob... - Can I ask you something? - Yeah, anything. What have you done to your hair? - What? - It's all weird and crispy. - Stop, it's not! - It is, though. Claire, back me up. Yeah, I have been meaning to say something, actually. Oh, you've waited long enough, haven't you? - What have you done to it? - Yeah. Rose? I can't face them. I can't face any of them. If I hadn't had the affair... ...Stephen would still be alive. It's all my fault. Frank. The money. What happened to Med. All of it. Rose... Listen to me. You didn't know what Frank was doing. It's not your fault. No. What's going to happen to Oliver? Look, I think it's likely that Madeline will get some access. But, look, they will take all of his feelings into account. And as far as Oliver is concerned... ...you're his mum, you've always been his mum. In cases like this, the child's best interests always come first. Rose... We're still looking into the company and we believe that Med was killed because he found a link between Bradwell & Marshbrook and organised crime. So, there's something that you could do. Because you... You worked there for years. You know all the clients. You know all the cases. And we can't prove the link without access to the company's files. Erm... OK, yeah. Yeah, I'd like to help. We've identified further properties across the North West we suspect are being used by the same criminal gang behind Breakwater. Some of the foot soldiers are starting to talk. We're planning a series of raids tonight. So your DS, Med, was really on to something. We're also continuing to look into Bradwell & Marshbrook's links with a criminal group, the gang leaders who think they can get away with killing a police officer. But, er, there we've hit a bit of a snag. Bill Bradwell's solicitor is claiming that he's medically unfit to answer our questions. They're saying he's got dementia. Even if he is ill, it doesn't mean he's not guilty. Well, it's up to the CPS. But if there's medical evidence that he's not fit to stand trial... Yeah, then he could walk. Sorry, boss. Sorry to interrupt. Bradwell & Marshbrook. Rose is willing to make a witness statement. We'll be in touch, OK? Yeah. Hey... Come here. As long as we're together, it'll be OK. Yeah. I know it's not the right time. But it never is. Mum, what is it? I have, er, something to tell you. And I couldn't live with myself if I didn't. So... ...it's up to you what you want to do with it. You know... ...what we were saying about Grandma? Yeah. Look, I should've said. I'm sorry. You don't need to pretend. I know she died, like, three years ago. Yeah, well, these things take time, and, erm... No more bullshit, Dad. I know you're not perfect, but don't... ...take the piss. All right? All right. - Mm. - Hm! So, because of Med's hunch, because of what he did, we've uncovered a vast drugs network. And that means a lot of lives are going to be saved. Look, I can't promise you 100% that we're going to catch the person that did this to Med. But we're close. We're really close. He always said you never gave up. He said, even if you were a pain in the arse. Oh, great...! No, I'm sorry, but he did say that. No, that's... That sounds about right. He said, even if you make mistakes... ...you always do the right thing in the end. - He fell off the roof. - What? Who fell off the roof? Oh! Ta-da! I need a word. OK. What? Right, I'm going to ask you one more time. - Why are you back, Andy? - Oh... I told you. My mum died. Yeah, but she died three years ago, didn't she? Who's Stephanie? Uh-huh... You... ...obviously know... ...or you wouldn't ask. What about Alfie? How old is he? He's, erm... He's three and a half. - This is your mum, isn't it? - No. - It is. No! - This is me. I was going to tell you. When? OK, OK. You know, so, yeah. I've had a life since we split up. Yeah. I know you have. So... That's not the point, Andy. You lied to me. You lied to me. You lied to the kids. I didn't lie. I just didn't tell you. It's... It's... All that shit about your mum, and about family, and wanting to step up for the kids, it was just all bollocks, wasn't it? - No, no. - This is why you came back. Somebody kicked you out and you had nowhere else to go. No, I came back for the kids. And I came back for you. - You haven't changed, Andy. - I have! I have changed! You haven't. Not where it matters. I have. Lisa... I had to. I had two kids to bring up on my own. Oh... Look, I don't even blame you. You're just... You're just being you. You got me when I was weak. And you're still fucking weak, Lisa. I know you. I know you, Lisa. I'm sorry. Sorry, sorry. - They're still my kids. - I never said they weren't. But this. This. You, me. This thing. This is done. This is over. - No, no... - You're their dad, right? But you have to be straight with them. You have to tell them about your other family. Turn up when you say you're going to. But that's it. - That's all that's on offer here. - I can change. - No. Andy, no. - I can. Andy... Look... You've made them tea. Why don't you just come over and... ...sit down? I'll leave you to it. And you can just... You can talk to them properly. They're not kids any more. They've been through a lot. They can make their own decisions. Erm... Come on, talk to them. Come on. OK. I can't. I can't. Fucking hell, Andy...! Just step the fuck up and talk to them! If you don't do this now, you might not get another chance. I know. I'm sorry. It was his choice to go. I wanted him to talk to you. I'm sorry. You both deserve so much better than this. You were right. I wish I wasn't. Are you OK, though? Yeah. Come here.
