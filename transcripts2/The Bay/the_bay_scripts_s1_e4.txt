 - I'm Sean. - I'm Lisa. - Did you tell anyone? - What do you think? The day before the twins went missing, Holly was at the train station. She was with somebody. I understand you gave Sean and Jess some money. Eight grand. Where did you get eight grand from? - How did it go with Wilko? - Yeah, all according to plan. Whatever you've got yourself mixed up in, you're not dragging me into it. I want to help you, but I can't.

 - Why not? - I promised. This is not just a MisPers case. We have one child dead. The other's still missing. We have to find her. They won't let me in. They won't let me see him. Why has he got a police guard with him? It's for his own protection. It's procedure when somebody's been assaulted. This is all your fault. If he hadn't been arrested, none of this would've happened. Sue, listen to me. He's in a safe place now, right? Excuse me... Sorry, is there any further information on Nick Mooney? He's going to be in surgery for a while yet.

 Abdominal injuries, suspected ruptured spleen. Oh, God... Can you tell me when he came in? - Half nine. - Thanks. Med, you stay with her. Yeah. Yeah, I can. Where are you going? Question one, who was the man at the station with Holly? There are currently three people in the frame. Stepdad Sean. Nick Mooney, who's now in hospital. And the twins' uncle, Ryan. We know he has a pair of trainers... ...like these. But he's family, so we have to be careful. I don't want to make another arrest until we're sure we've got something solid. Lisa needs to talk to him in the first instance. Whoever this man is, we have to find him... ...cos maybe he can lead us to Holly. Question two... ...could Holly herself have been involved in Dylan's death? Her DNA was found under his fingernails. The mum's painted a picture of the twins as being best buddies, but what if that's not the case? I'm going to talk to the youth club worker, see if he can cast any light on things. And now that we've identified the place Dylan died... ...Stu, I want to continue with house to house, but let's expand the area. Somebody must have seen or heard something that night. Let's go. Hey. - Shouldn't you be at school? - I bunked off, didn't I? - Why? - I want to talk to you. Look, look... I'm sorry about last night. I know I shouldn't have done that but... I don't know, I panicked. Have you any idea what kind of shit you've got me into? Abbie, stop! Abbie, Abbie, listen... Listen! I know. That's... If you pay them off, can you get out of this without...? Go on, take it. But that's it. It's the end. - Is it going to be enough? - I don't know. Are you all right? Hey. Are you not going to introduce us? Vincent, Sam. Sam, Vincent. See you later. Is that your boyfriend? - Shut up. - ♪ Young love... ♪ Shut up! So, how are you doing? - Yeah, good. - Only... What? I thought you were going to give that stuff to Wilko. - I did give it to him. - Nah, that's not what he said. He says he didn't get anything. He says that he doesn't even know who you are. Yeah, well, he's lying. He's talking shit. He gave me this. It's short. You'll have to speak to him about that. I will. - I'm going to... - Abbie... Abbie, get in the car. I want to talk to you. Come on. Right... This is our main entrance view. Hard to make out any detail. - They just dumped him and sped off. - Right, pause there. Difficult to make out the reg, apart from the first few digits. OK, keep going. OK, we're gonna need a copy of this, mate. Thanks. Stu, I need you to run a PNC for me. But I've only got a partial VRM. It's the van that was used to dump Nick at the hospital. Bloody hell, Lise, I'm up to my tits here as it is. Did you miss the training on gender-neutral language, Stu? Shit. Sorry. You know what I mean. I'm only winding you up, you twat. - Come on, it'll only take a minute. - Go on, what is it? Right, it's a pale-grey Transit van. The VRM starts Romeo 93. Left the hospital at 9:28. Can you find out who it's registered to? And can you track it, find out where it went next? I'm not promising anything. A lot of the CCTV in town is down. A spate of vandalism. Little shits. Great. Right, well, just, I don't know, see what you can do. Oh, Lise? The boss wants you to talk to Ryan, see if he's got an alibi for Sunday, when Holly bought the tickets. OK, I'm on it. Just get back to me if you get anything on that van, yeah? What are you doing here? - Hiya. Is Ryan in? - No. - Why? - Mum... Who is it? The thing with Wilko is... ...he's not reliable. I knew that from the get-go. You just get a feeling with some people, do you know what I mean? See, it's a question of trust. Cos I'm in business here. And... in business, that's what it's about. Trust. Cos I can trust you, can't I? Of course you can. Good. Cos there's something else I want you to do for me. Right, where were you on the evening of the 23rd? - What? - It's last Sunday. - The day before the twins went missing. - This is ridiculous. Mum, it's all right. It's all right. Erm... I was on the boat. OK. Who with? Just me. - You went out on the boat on your own? - I do it all the time. Nothing would get done if I left Sean to it. Right, you bought out Sean's share in the boat earlier this year... Not this again. I've already told you lot, I earned that cash, I saved it up. - Did you give Holly any money? - What? - Why would he do that? - Did you? No. You know, maybe a few quid here and there, if she's going to the shops or something, but... ...nothing more than that. OK. Sorry, excuse me. Yeah? Lisa, it's Stu. I think I've found your van. How well do you know Holly? I hardly know her at all. She's just one of the kids. Nice girl, quiet. Never any trouble. Not like some of them. You know what they're like, kids. Bloody hormones running riot. Holly's not like that. She's different, she's... I thought you said you hardly know her. I don't. I just keep my eye on things. You have to in this job. Cos half of them are thieving little bastards. We've had the lead nicked off the roof three times. What about Dylan? Well, he could be more of a handful. He could be a right little shit, to be honest. I know I shouldn't say that, speak ill of the dead and all that, but... ...he could be a cheeky little bastard. How did they get on? All right, as far as I know. Only, the last few months, they weren't together as much as they used to be. They used to always be together. Why do you think that might have been? I don't know. But something changed. I mean, Holly was always quiet, but recently she seemed... What? Distracted. She was always on the phone. You think there was someone else on the scene? Erm... A boyfriend? Could be. You know what they're like, copping off with one another all over the shop. Do you think she was involved with someone here at the youth club? Look... Where are you going with all this? I've already told you everything I know. Like I say, we're just following up inquiries. No. I know. I know. A middle-aged man working with kids. - Kids go missing... - What? I do this job because it's a job. I have a mortgage to pay, and I've got kids of my own, for Christ's sake. Look, I'm not accusing you of anything, Martin. No. No, no. It's just, erm... This last week's been a bloody nightmare. Hanna... Hanna! Is Krzysztof in? No, he's working. I'm sorry, I have to get to college. That's all right. It'll only take a minute. It's Krzysztof I wanted to talk to you about. Does he have a pale-grey van, registration number R933 UOA? - Why do you want to know this? - Because it's important. Is that his van, Hanna? Yes. But he doesn't have it. He lent it to Sean. This lady has information. And she's sure it was Dylan and Holly? Hello. I take her out last thing at night. And there were three of them, they were arguing in the alley. - What about? - Oh, I don't know, love. My hearing's not the best. And there were definitely three of them? Well, they were in the shadows, so I couldn't see very well. But, yes, it was the boy and the girl. And this other one, he was bigger. Thank you. Can you just talk to anyone whose house backs out onto this alley, both sides? See if anyone saw or heard anything else. OK. _ Sorry, Miss. You're not meant to be playing games in school, Rob. It's not a game. _ Morning, pal. How are we doing? All right, Sean. How are you doing? Sean! - What do you want? I'm busy. - Sean! You were caught on CCTV. I'm here to take you in. I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, OK. You don't know what happened to Nick. You stood there, in your house, you stood there, you looked me in the eye and you lied to me. "What kind of man do you think I am?" you said. - Well, this is the kind of man you are. - No. Don't lie to me, Sean. Don't even think about lying to me again. Talk to me. Tell me what happened. It might do you a favour down the line if you co-operate now. Or I can just get a search team down here and see what they find. - Fine. - All right, OK. OK. I did it. It was me. I picked him up and I brought him to the boathouse. You and who else? Look, I'm not a grass, Lisa, all right? I'll tell you what I did and that's all. I tried to get him to talk, but... ...but he wouldn't. So you beat the shit out of him. Well, you lot weren't doing anything, were you? We were doing our jobs. We were doing things the right way. - You let him go. - You're an arsehole. You're a fucking arsehole! He's in surgery. They're operating on him. Ruptured spleen and Christ knows what else. What if he doesn't make it? And what if he makes it and he's messed up for the rest of his life? That's his life ruined. It's his mum's life ruined. And for what? Look, it was... It was stupid. But I'm telling you... ...he knows something. He does. He knows something about the twins, - about what happened to Holly. - What makes you say that? Cos he wouldn't say anything. No matter what we said, no matter what we... ...what we did. He said he couldn't because he'd promised. He kept on saying that. He said, "I promised. I promised. I promised I wouldn't tell." Wilko... Can I have a word? So, now what? Well, now you come down to the station. Again. You know, if I go down, I could take you down with me. - Is that right? - Mm. I could tell them everything. You know, what happened that night. What'd happen then? - You'd still go down. - What would happen to you? I'd be suspended. Investigated. - Sacked, most likely. - Yeah. What about you, though? You're already looking at jail, a criminal record, do you want to lose Jess as well? If that comes out, about you and me, what do you think she's going to say? Jess knows me. She knows I'm not a saint. Yeah? Does she know about Hanna, too? Do what you've got to do, Sean. - You stitched me up. - Oh, mate, fuck off! Fuck you! What do you want? Vincent sent me. Are you Pete? He told me to give you this. You've got something for him. It's all there. Count it. That's OK. I trust you. Are you ready, then, love? Er, I'm just going to check on the kids. Where's your sister? She's not in her room. I don't know, do I? She's suspended. She's not supposed to be going out. And that's my problem how? Right, can I get some privacy here? All right? What? What is it? I don't think this is the right time, love. Just with everything that's going on. Lisa needs me. The kids need me. - I need you. - I know. But just for a bit. Just until things calm down. Can we put it on hold, the move? You take all the time you need, love. Thanks. Mm... But not too long. The witness states there was definitely three of them, one female, two male. She puts the time at about 11. Now, both Nick and Sean have alibis. Nick was at the all-night shop, Sean was with his bit on the side. So that just leaves Ryan. He claims he was with Krzysztof. Stu... CCTV confirms they left the Royal at 10:44. We pick them up back on the prom at 11:10. But in between, at 10:59... This is the cash machine on the corner of Marine Road and Queen Street. Krzysztof withdrew 30 quid. There's no sign of Ryan. So that leaves 25 minutes where Ryan's unaccounted for. What if, during that time, Ryan caught up with the twins? - It'd be tight, time-wise. - But doable. Boss... One minute. I've been calling you all day. Where have you been? I know, I know. Just... What are you doing here? I've come to hand myself in. Are you sure he's not just covering himself for kicking the shit out of Nick? No. He meant it. You trust him? As far as Sean is concerned, Nick definitely knows something about what happened to Holly. Well, that's not much good to us while he's unconscious. Med's still at the hospital with Nick's mum. - I could get him to do some digging. - Get me anything you can on Nick. Leave Sean to me. And, er... go and talk to the family, tell them what's happening. Yeah. Why Nick? Why did you target him in the first place? Because he was arrested. He was "the local man" you talked about on the news. - Says who? - People talk around here. It's a small community. Who was the other man, when you left Nick at the hospital? It was Krzysztof's van. Was it him? I told you, I ain't naming names. Or was it Ryan? How do you get on, you and Ryan? Why? What's that got to do with anything? Well, it's just... ...you're family, but you work for him. - I know that can be... - I don't work for him. - He works for me. - But he owns the boat, doesn't he? He bought you out. I thought this was to do with Nick. How did he get on with the twins? What? Why? Would you say he's a violent man? Are you saying he had something to do with what happened to the twins? Hey, hey... I'm not saying anything. Look, I'm not being funny, but if you're gonna keep going AWOL, then... What? Well, I'm just saying, keep me in the loop. OK? We're meant to be a team here. Are you done? Good. Cos I need you to talk to Sue. Mind out. Hey, you mind out! Here, make yourself useful and bung that back in my room. Sake, Gran...! You don't seem that surprised. What do you want me to do, burst out into tears? No. But don't you want to know why he's been arrested? Go on, then. False imprisonment. Assault. Grievous bodily harm. Imprisonment? Who's he supposed to have imprisoned? Nick Mooney. The man we brought in for questioning. The man we released. Well, there you go, then. - The police did nothing, so... - So, what? So, Sean did. And I'm glad he did it. I'm proud of him. I am. He got what was coming to him. Where were you last night, Ryan? He was at ours. All night. - You'll say that in court, will you? - Of course I will. I want to see him. Can you take me to see Sean? I should never have let him go out on his own. I should never have let him out of my sight. Oh, don't blame yourself. Right? It's not your fault. You can't keep tabs on him 24 hours a day. You're right. He's a grown man. Of course he is. He's got his own life to live. So... ...when he's not looking after you, what does he do with himself? Does he have any interests, any hobbies? Well, he goes to the allotment. He loves it up there. Oh, he goes fishing sometimes. Oh, yeah? Well, where does he go? Sunderland Point. He used to go there with his dad. All right, thanks. If you want me to take a statement... Kaz... All right? Thank you. Sorry, is the boss still in with Sean Meredith? - Yeah, he's making a statement. - Right. Sorry, Lisa, there's someone waiting to see you. Says it's urgent. Can you just look after Jess for me, Kaz? All right, darling. Do you want to take a seat over here? It's about Sean. What about him? I don't know what he's said to you, but it wasn't Sean who hurt Nick. He's not like that. He's a good man. A good man that cheats on his pregnant wife. Sean is many things, but he is not violent. Ryan was the one who attacked Nick. Krzysztof told me. He was there. He was there, too. You think this is easy for me to come here? Krzysztof is my husband. It was Ryan... ...who hurt Nick. Sean stopped him and dragged him off. And then Sean and Krzysztof brought Nick to the hospital. They saved him. You're being released on bail, pending further inquiries. We'll need you to hand in your passport. I ain't got a passport. And you'll need to obey a strict curfew between 6pm and 6am. How am I supposed to work? What if I have to go out on the boat at night? - That's our livelihood, that's... - In that case, we'll need you to report in at the station every morning between nine and ten. Sign here and here. Can I go now? Lisa... Word to the wise. I saw your Abbie up the West End earlier. She made herself scarce as soon as she clocked me. I thought you should know. Yeah. Cheers, Kaz. Hey. Where are you? Just in the library. Why, what's up? I'm just checking in. You don't need to keep tabs on me, Mum. I'm not. I'm... Look, Karen says she saw you up the West End earlier. - What were you doing up there? - Just calling on Anne-Marie. I thought she lived in Carnforth. They moved. So why did you do a runner? Just... ...cos I'm suspended. Look, you shouldn't be up that end of town, anyway, on your own. It's not safe. I'm fine, Mum. It's fine. OK. Be good. Krzysztof! I'm sorry. Oh, go on, get out! Get the fuck! Get your fucking hands off me! Ryan, don't make it worse for yourself, mate. This is stupid! Shut up, you. Look at you. You look about two, anyway. And don't talk to me. Get off! Are you gonna arrest the whole family? Is that it? Oi! The carpet's bloody ruined. Who's going to pay for that? Margaret, I've already told you, we'll sort everything, all right? - Who the bloody hell are you? - Anything? No. Find! Boss... Needless to say, as a council, we're doing everything we can to assist the police in their investigation, and to support the family. But I would appeal to the public that, if they know anything, anything at all that might help, please do come forward. Councillor, any more information on Holly? I can't say at this moment. All I can assure everyone is the police are doing everything they can to find her. Sam... Sad, isn't it? Did you know him? No. Did you? So, did you... ...get it sorted? Yeah. Good. Look, I just wanted to say that I'm... Sam! Sam... Oh, hi, Abbie. Hi. Sam, we have to go. Your mum's waiting. Why did you attack Nick? Cos he knows something about the twins. He said he made a promise. So... ...you were trying to get him to talk. Or maybe you were trying to get him to shut up, cos maybe he knows too much. What? When the forensics from your jeans come back, whose blood will be on them? Nick's or Dylan's? What are you talking about? We also want to talk to you about another matter. This money was found hidden in your bedroom. Where did it come from? - I earned it. - How? Work. What kind of work? On the boat, on the bay. There's over ten grand here. And then there's the eight grand that you gave to Sean. Are you saying you earn that kind of money as a trawlerman? I work hard, don't I? No rent to pay. No kids. That I know of. I saved it up. And stashed it in your bedroom. I don't trust banks. Don't you watch the news? The biggest bastards in the world. The money's wrapped in freezer bags. Why's that? The house is damp, isn't it? I didn't want it to get damaged. Only, the thing is, we found some money in Holly's backpack... ...wrapped in exactly the same way. Used notes, same as this. Did you give her that money? No. Could she have taken it? No. Nobody knows it was there. Hey, what is it? It's Nick. He's awake. - All right, Dave? - Hi, Lisa. Do you want to take a break for ten minutes? We can keep an eye on him. - I'm meant to stay with him. - Oh, I won't tell if you don't. - Cheers, Lisa. I'm busting for a pee. - All right. Hiya. Hey, Nick. Sue, would it be all right if I just spoke to Nick for a couple of minutes? Med could maybe take you for a cuppa or something. Love, if you need me, I'll be just outside. Come on, then, Sue. Thanks, Sue. Cheers, Med. Hi, Nick. I know, I'm the last person you want to see. I'm sorry. I just really need your help, mate. Nick, would it be all right if I sat down? Thank you. Your mum said you had a tough time at school. Is that right? You and me both. I hated it. I couldn't wait to get out of there. Well, I didn't, in the end. I got kicked out. - Why? - Why did I get expelled? Erm, I punched a teacher, didn't I? I'm not proud of it. I am a bit proud of it, actually. He was a shithead. Hm. What about you, though, and school? - I hated it. - Yeah? Was it all bad? The only time where it were good were when I went away. Away? Yeah, the place where... ...kids like me would go every summer. No-one to pick on us. That's kids for you, though, isn't it? They can be horrible. But you know that better than most. Was Dylan like that? - Sometimes. - Mm. And what about Holly? No. No, Holly was different. Holly's nice. - How long have I been in here? - Oh, since this morning. It's too long. What do you mean? - It's too long. - Too long for what? Nick... Nick? If you know something, anything at all that can help us find Holly... Nick, listen, we have got the men that did this to you. We're not going to let them get away with it. We're on your side. We want to help you. I just need you to help me, too. I need you to help me find Holly. - I can't. - Why not? I just can't. Nick, your mum was in bits not knowing where you were. That's how Jess is feeling right now. She's really suffering. Please, I have to go. Wait, wait. Where do you have to go? What do you have to do? I can't tell you. - You can. You can tell me anything. - I can't. - Why not? - Because I promised. OK, OK. OK, who did your promise? Look, what promise did you make? Nick, if there's something that you need to do, you tell me, and I'll go and do it for you, all right? Just say the word. ♪ The skies are grey... ♪ Nick, who did you promise? What promise did you make? ♪ You know, dear, how much I love you ♪ ♪ So please don't take my sunshine away... ♪ I'm going to get your mum, all right? - I'm here, Nick. - ♪ You're my sunshine ♪ - Nick... - ♪ My only sunshine - Nick, it's Mum. - ♪ You make me happy - Talk to us, love. - ♪ When skies are grey... ♪ - Talk to us. - Nick... Did you promise someone that you wouldn't tell where she is, is that it? It's OK to break your promise. Talk to them, tell them. ♪ You never know, dear... ♪ All right, you made a promise and you don't break promises, right? So you can't tell me. - ♪ You are my sunshine... ♪ - You can help, right? In your own way. Is that what's going on? ♪ You make me happy when skies are grey... ♪ What is that flipping song? It's just a campfire song he sang as a kid. What campfire? When he came back from camp, he always sang it. - What camp? - Summer camp. Sunshine Summer Club. ♪ Know, dear, how much I love you... ♪ Where is that? - What? - Where is it? It's out of town, on the way to Silverdale. Silverdale. But it closed down years ago. It's abandoned. It's OK. Med, let's go. Oh, shit! Jesus...! Hey, Holly. It's all right. Don't be scared. Don't be scared. My name is Lisa. I'm with the police. And everything's going to be fine, OK? Good girl. - Lisa?! - Are you hurt? - Lisa?! - No? Good. OK. Med! Med, we're down here! Everything'll be OK. You've got nothing to be scared of. Everything's going to be OK. Everything's going to be fine. Subtitles by TVT
