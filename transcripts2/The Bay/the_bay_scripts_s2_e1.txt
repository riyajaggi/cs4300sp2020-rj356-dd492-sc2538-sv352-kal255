No, it's Dad. Stephen...

 LAUGHTER, CHATTER AND MUSIC Hiya. Hey. It won't be the same without you, Dad. Mm. It's not like I'm going to disappear. No, of course you're not. The bloody thing keeps going out. I, er... I wanted to pick your brains, actually. About the Breakwater account. Any questions about the business, take them up with Stephen. He's running things now. Well, it's just that... - Come here, let me do it. - Oh, no, no, it's all right, Bill. I've got it, it's just... There. Thanks. Thanks, Bill. Well done, Daddy. Hi. Is your dad in? Dad! - There's somebody at the door. - I'm a bit busy here, mate. No, but it's a delivery. Maybe it's a present or something. Come on, then. Rose, just keep an eye on that for a sec. All right. - Stephen Marshbrook? - Yes. - Hi. Have you got something for me? - Yes. I'm sorry to drag you out over a bit of lead, but they've stripped the lot. We've only just had it redone. We had to have a charity auction last time. - Everybody rallied round. - Mm. - We can't ask them again. - I know. Look, we'll go through the CCTV and we'll put the word out. But the chances of us finding them... I'm sorry, love. I'm just being honest. - Hi, Lisa. - Hey. Who pissed in your porridge? You try climbing through pigeon shit on the roof of the Alhambra, see how you like it. Just another scintillating day in the life of a community copper. Yeah, it's still police work, Lisa. Somebody's got to do it. - I know, boss. I didn't mean to... - Boss? - Can I have a word? - Yeah. Brilliant. Come on, Leese. The boss knows you've done your time. It won't be long now. Get back out there... back in the saddle. She thinks she knows it all now, now that she's a big-time detective. Mm-hm. Yes, all right. Yes, yes, yes. Aw... - Who's your mate? - A present from the Al Shamis. Just to say thank you. I said there's no need, but... No, I'm going to declare it. I know the rules, that you're not allowed to accept gifts from... Listen, I wasn't going to say a word. I think you make a lovely couple. Shooting at a house on Williamson Road. One fatality. Med, with me, now. Lisa... Come on, then, get a shift on. When you get in the house, Med takes the lead. - What he says goes. All right? - Boss. Med, she's on probation. If she sets one foot wrong, I want to know about it. Can you move back, folks? - Family? - Around the back, boss. Get this tented off. - I want statements from everyone. - Sure. After you. - I have to see to it! - Rose, that'll do! Stop it! - But I have to clean him up. - You can't. I can't just leave him like that! Rose, please, listen to them. I'm sorry, they're right. You can't. You have to leave it. Forensics will need to... I'm sorry. Come on, let's sit you down. There, that's better. OK? I'm Med and this is Lisa. We're going to be your Family Liaison Officers. Can I just get everybody's names, please? Yes. Yes, of course. I'm Mark. Bill Bradwell. Med, was it? This is my daughter, Rose. My son, Mark. My daughter-in-law, Stella. This is my grandson, Oliver. And the victim? Er... Stephen. My husband. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Hi, Oliver. I'm Lisa. He was there. He saw it happen. I've arranged for the family to be moved. There's an ABE suite on standby. Boss... The Wi-Fi cable's been cut. And the alarm system, too. Whoever it was, they knew what they were doing. Rose... Rose, we're going to need your permission to take his clothes. Oh, yeah. Yes, of course. Erm, and can I just ask, is there anybody else, a family member perhaps, who could act as Oliver's appropriate adult? Er, I'm sorry? So, it's just for when we interview him, cos he's underage. - Yeah, but I'm his mum. - No, I know, but it's... The thing is, we're gonna have to interview you, too. So, you can't actually stay with him. I'm sorry. No, no, I can't... - I can't just leave him. - Rose... Rose, he's not going to be on his own, I promise you. I promise you. I'm gonna have a social worker sit in with him. I know some really, really good ones. I just need to make a couple of calls. - OK? - Yeah. Come on. He hasn't spoken. Hasn't said a word. Hasn't cried, even. The social worker's arrived. - We're gonna need specialist help. - What was that? No, no, it was just Lisa. I think we should keep things contained and keep numbers to a minimum. It's not a job for Social. We need a child psychologist. - Thanks, Lisa. I'm on top of it. - She's right. I'll get that sorted. You two focus on the others for now. - Preliminary interviews. - Boss. Look, I'm not trying to step on your toes, but the kid needs some help. Let's just get on with it, yeah? Do you have any idea who might have done this, Rose? No. No. Did Stephen have anyone that had a grudge against him? No, he was just an ordinary man. We... It was just a party. It was just a barbecue. It's all right. He was an only child... ...Stephen. Mum and Dad are both dead. We were the only family he had, I suppose. They have three kids, him and Rose. There's Oliver, the youngest. And there's Jamie. He's just finished university. He was meant to start work, but... ...decided to take a year off, backpacking round Europe. Anyway, he's... He's on his way home now. And then there's Grace. But, er... ...we don't see her any more. Why not? Hm. It's a long story. Oh! - No rest for the wicked. - Oh... Oh! It's for our Muna. - How did you get on? - Er, good. Yeah, we're starting to build relationships, get a sense of the lay of the land, so... And what about Lisa, how was she? Did she follow your lead? Yeah, she was... - What? - Fine. - What? - No. It's just... It's nothing. Look, I mean... She's really good at her job, she's just... I hear you. Leave it with me. Turn it the fuck down! Why should I? Er, A, because it's too loud. B, because I'm trying to study. And C, because it is absolute shit! Guys, guys, come on... Rob, turn it down! I can't hear myself think here! I hate this place! - Kids these days... - Yeah. Tell me about it. He does have a point, though. Oh, love, come on, don't you start and all. - Mum, I'm not. It's just, I mean... - Well, I'm trying! I'm doing my best. I know it's not ideal. I didn't want to move here any more than you did. But, you know, we are where we are. At least until I get my stripes back. I know. OK, Stephen Marshbrook was a solicitor for a family law firm. His wife, Rose, runs the office. And her brother Mark works there, too. Now, the business was set up by Rose and Mark's dad, Bill Bradwell. But he's recently retired. His wife died some years ago. The firm deals in family law. Wills, conveyancing, property. Not criminal law. They're well known and respected in the community. So, why would Stephen Marshbrook have been murdered, on his own doorstep, in front of his young son? Med... Stephen and Rose have three kids. So, we have Oliver. He's the youngest. He's ten. And then there's Jamie, 21. Just graduated from university. And Grace, 23. Now, her grandad says she's a bit of a tearaway. Had a run-in with the police a few years back. She was arrested for TDA in 2013. Nicked her grandad's car. Yeah, but he refused to press charges, so she just got off with a caution. And it caused a breakdown in the family. She stormed out, hasn't spoken to them since. Oh, and we've no idea where she is. We need to track her down. Make it a priority. The only witness we have to the shooting itself is the victim's son, Oliver. But he's still too traumatised to talk. We have a specialist child psychologist arriving today. So, Med, I need you to continue working with the rest of the family. But first, let's get Rose into safe accommodation. Stu, Eddie, let's expand the parameters of the house-to-house and CCTV. We also need to get a briefing out to the press, Karen. And the postmortem is scheduled for this morning. When we recover the rounds, we'll get some indication of the murder weapon. - So... - Sorry. Boss, sorry to interrupt. Just, er, what did you want me to do? I've been developing quite a good relationship with Rose. So, maybe I could help Med with the FLO... No. Erm, Med can handle that. I want you to go to the law firm, Lisa. Talk to the rest of the staff. Was Stephen involved in any disputes at work? Did he have any rivals, any... ...any pissed off clients, any enemies? Who would want to take out a professional hit on this seemingly ordinary man? All right? You've got your actions, let's go. Try not to shag anyone this time. I'll catch you up. I'm sorry, we're closed. DC Armstrong, West Lancashire Police. Could I just have a word? - Yeah, of course. - That's great, thank you. So, you weren't at the party yourself, Lyn? No, I wasn't invited. I'm new. I've only been with the firm six months. It was more of a family thing. Could you just talk me through what everyone does in the firm? Erm... Rose, Stephen's wife, she's office manager, part-time. She's very... organised. Keeps us all on our toes. OK. What about Mark? Mark does a lot of the day-to-day business with the clients. A lot of the stuff Stephen wouldn't have time for. Wait, so does...? Sorry, did Mark work for Stephen? No. Not exactly. Mark's not a partner. Whereas, Stephen was a senior... ...partner. Sorry. Look, Lyn, I'm sorry, I have to ask. Erm... Is there anyone that had a grievance against Stephen? You know, a client or, I don't know, a business rival? No. Everyone liked him. No-one had a bad word to say about him. I can't understand it. - I can't believe it. - Hello? Sorry, Mark, er... - This is, er... - Oh, it's DC Armstrong. - I was at the house yesterday. - Yes. Yes, of course. Look... I'm afraid this really isn't a good time. We want to help. But not today. Everyone's in shock. Yes, of course. Of course. That's fine, I'll leave you in peace. Thank you so much for your help, Lyn, and we'll be in touch. OK. - Look, why don't you go home? - No. No, I want to help. I want to keep busy. Lyn... it's fine, go home. Hey. Everything all right? Yeah, everything's fine. I just heard on the radio about that murder. - I can't talk about work, Mum. - No, I know. But the thing is, I know him. I mean, I knew him. - Where are you now? - I'm at work, at the shop. OK, I'm on my way. Yeah, if you want to talk to her, you might have to, you know, use words. Who said I want to talk to her? They did your dad's will. They took care of everything when he died. - And you got to know Stephen? - Well, not much, but he was around. I'm sorry. I mostly dealt with the older man, Bill. He was a bit odd. - How do you mean? - Just... I don't know, there was something hard about him. Not somebody that you would warm to. OK. What about Stephen? He seemed OK. He seemed nice. Sorry, it's probably not much use. I just thought you should know, in case it's something that you need to declare or whatever. No, it's fine, Mum. Sorry, can I ask how much this is? Only, I've not got my reading glasses. I'll leave you to it. If you think of anything else, give me a shout. - Oh, OK, love. Yeah, that's ?10. - Oh. Lisa... I know you're really busy with work and everything. So, er, if you need any help at home, if you want me to come and give the kids their tea... We're fine, Mum. Honestly. OK, because I know it isn't easy. - Abbie's got her exams and Rob's... - We're fine. We're managing. OK. Good! That's good. Are you OK? Oh, you know me, the same old, same old. OK. Are you all right? - Right, let's go. - Thank you. Thank you. Right... Why don't you get settled in? PC Rowley will be just out here as well. Why? - Why do I need an armed guard? - No, no, it's just... It's all routine. When a firearm's been involved, it's standard procedure. I should be with Oliver. I should never have left him on his own. No, no, he's not on his own, Rose. He's only ten! He's never even spent a night away from home before. - He's never even been on a sleepover! - Rose, I promise you. We are looking after him. All right? Just try and get some rest, at least. As soon as it's possible, I'll take you to see him. - SHE SIGHS - Trust me. Hey. Hey. Can you do us a favour? I'll clear it with the boss. Hey, Rose. How are you getting on? I, er... I... Hey, it's all right. It's all right. He was like a son to me. My right-hand man. He was. I'm sorry. No. - No, don't be, it's... - Grandad? - Oh, Grandad... - Jamie! Where's Mum? Well, she's not answering the phone. We went to the house, they wouldn't let us anywhere near it. - Where is she? - Yeah, I'll take you to her. I'm sorry. I'm making such a show of myself. Oh, come on, don't be daft. That's what he'd say. - Stephen? - No. No, my dad. He'd say, "You have to be strong." He'd say, "You have to pull yourself together." And he's right. No, come on, now. You've just lost your husband. It's OK to be upset. It's OK to be broken, you've... I'm sure your dad would understand that. Yeah, of course. Mum! Oh! Theo... Thank you. - Thank you for coming. - No, it's... I'm sorry, Mum, I shouldn't have gone away. I should've been here. Oh, no, you're here now. That's the main thing. - Has Grace been in touch? - She hasn't made contact? We don't even know where she is. I do. I know where she is. Can we get any better images than that? - I can try for sure. - Yeah, just a minute, I'm, erm... Boss, we think we've found Grace. She's working at a scrapyard outside Barrow. Well, if Grace is still in the area, why hasn't she come forward? She's bound to have heard. Anything else on the family? Yeah. Er, Jamie's arrived back now, too, with his partner Theo. Erm, I also talked to Bill. He's the SPOC. Now, he says the family was tightknit. And statements from the other guests at the party, they tend to bear this out. So, aside from the Grace thing, they do paint a picture of one big, happy family, really. Are you sure about that, though? Just... ...I've been getting the impression that all wasn't well in the business. There seem to be tensions around the fact that Stephen was a partner and Mark wasn't. And I'm sensing something just not quite right in Rose's relationship with her dad. - OK. - Right. No, no, sorry, sorry, boss, that's not how the family sees it. Well, they're not going to just come right out and say that, are they? Just, if Bill's the SPOC, we might want to think about... Sorry, I have to interrupt you there. I'm really sorry, Lisa, but with all due respect... ...I've spent time with him, I've been in the house, getting to know him, so I... It's not a question of time, is it? It's knowing what to look for. - So what should I be looking for? - All right, that'll do, you two. - That's enough. - Yeah. Sorry. Stu... Er, yeah. We've been going through CCTV. The Marshbrooks' house is on a cul-de-sac. We've checked all the traffic in and out on the day of the murder and the only vehicle we haven't been able to account for is this one. A blue Fiat van from a courier service called PDD. Yeah, we've spoken to the company and there were no deliveries scheduled for that day in the area. And the plates don't match any of their vehicles. They do, however, match those of a Vauxhall Corsa reported stolen eight days ago in Salford. It looks like this... is our killer. - Boss, the thing is... - No, no. I don't want to hear it. A man's lost his life. You know, we're all under pressure here. Whatever shit you've got going on between you, you put it to one side and you do your job. Do I make myself clear? - Yes, sir. - Yes, boss. I'm sorry. I thought I told you, Lisa, Med takes the lead. What he says goes. But she's right. You need to dig deeper. If there's bad blood in this family, we need to know about it. You need to pull your finger out here, Med. No, don't blame Med. I shouldn't have flown off the handle. It won't happen again. Well, it better bloody not. It's my neck on the line here, too, you know. Do you not think I've got enough on my plate without this? Now, go on, the pair of you. And talk to Grace for a kick-off. Find out what's going on in this family. - Do your job. - Sir. - I'll see you later. - See you later. Whoa, watch where you're going! I heard that crack earlier, at the briefing. It was just a joke, Leese. Lighten up, fuck's sake. Lighten up? I was only pissing about. You weren't just pissing about, though. You were questioning my ability to do my job. You were trying to undermine me in front of the entire team. You should've thought about that before... Go on, before what? Go on. - You know what. - Lisa... I have been demoted. I've been fined. I've had to sell my house. I'm living in a bloody shoebox with my kids. Whatever I did, I've more than made up for it! Lisa... You don't half choose your moments. I know. Wanker. Can I help you? - Yeah. - Yeah, erm... Detective Sergeant Kharim. And this is Detective Constable Armstrong. - And you are? - Frank Mercer. I'm the gaffer here. What can I do for you? We're looking for Grace Marshbrook. - Why? - It's all right, Frank. Listen, we're, er... We're sorry to have to meet like this, under these circumstances. You have heard about your dad? Of course I have. How's Oliver? Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's being looked after. And you haven't been in touch with the family? Why's that? We don't talk. How come? Well, you're the police. It's all on file, I expect. Well, we'd like to hear your side of the story. They made it perfectly clear they want nothing to do with me, so I want nothing to do with them. Even now? Even now. Where were you yesterday afternoon? You've got... You've got to be kidding me? No. I was here. I was working. You can ask Frank. You can ask any of them. They'll tell you. There you go. Yesterday's deliveries. She signed for them. Thank you. OK. So, you'll vouch for her, will you? I don't have to, do I? It's there in black and white. - But, yeah, I will, as it goes. - OK. She was here all day with me. Right, thank you. It was awful, what happened. But she had nothing to do with it. She has nothing to do with her family. Thanks. Well? I have her signature on the delivery note at 15:00 on the day. Yeah, but just because she didn't pull the trigger, it doesn't mean she didn't set it up. We can't rule her out. But we don't have enough to take her in, either. Listen, erm... ...about earlier. This is your case, Med. I just... I just want to do my job, mate. So... what now, boss? We dig deeper. OK. What's wrong? Nothing's wrong. Look, I... I know I'm not supposed to phone you when you're at work, but I just want to say I'll be home late tonight. - Oh, yeah? And why's that, then? - Cos I got a job. Waitressing at The Beach Cafe. Abbie, you've got your exams. I know, but it's just in the evenings. Love, you don't have to do this. We'll manage. Mum, I... I want to. OK. You should go and see them. No. They obviously don't want me there. Let's just get back to work. Ooph! Some guard dog you are. I don't know what you're talking about! Hello? They were here last week, Bill. You liked it. Just give them a chance. - What are they doing in my house? - Dad... We talked about this. Bill, we agreed you'd do this. I didn't agree to anything! Now, go on, bugger off! I can make my dinner, thank you. I'm not completely bloody useless! I'm sorry, is this not a good time? And what was that about? It's just a new arrangement and he forgets sometimes. He thinks he can look after himself. He thinks he's still 100%. But he's just getting more muddled. - So, what do you mean, he thinks... - I can hear you, you know! I'm not deaf. No, no, we were just having a chat, Bill. I don't know. People traipsing round my house. As if I didn't have enough to contend with. As if... Go on. Get out of my home. I think you should probably go. 'It's OK if you don't feel like talking. 'Sometimes, I don't feel like talking. 'But there's loads of other things we can do.' How did you get on? Not great. Bill. He wasn't in a fit state to talk. Well, he's grieving. I... I think it's more than that. Anyway, how about you? How's Oliver doing? Still nothing, not a word. Look... maybe if we could just make it a bit more homely. If he had his familiar things around him, it might just help him open up, you know. And maybe if he had his mum with him, too? Yeah. - Are you all right, Dave? - Hey. - Can I get through? - You'll have to go round the back. OK, cheers, mate. - Have you found something, mate? - Some papers in the ashes. Right, we've got nothing useful from the text, I'm afraid. But the logo's clear. So, it's possible that Stephen's just used work paper to light the barbecue. But realistically? - Ah, look who it is! - Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt. Oh, don't be daft. It's only me. How are you? - Yeah, I'm good, thanks. - Yeah... Just, er... - Lisa, er, could you just... - Yeah. Sorry, yeah, of course. Good to see you, Ellen. - Bye, Lisa. - Bye, Ellen. See you. - Are you all right? - Er, yeah. Come on, let's go and see him. When can he come home? I mean, not "home" home, but... Yeah, it's going to take us a few more days, but we're moving as quickly as we can. We're talking to the school, yeah? And we're going to make sure every measure's put in place. Hiya. I just brought some of your stuff, Oliver. Now, I just grabbed whatever I could see, so if you need anything else, just let me know, OK? Thank you. Oliver... Hello, Rob. We need to make arrangements, find them somewhere to stay in the longer term. They can't stay in that hotel indefinitely. - Sorry, do you mind if I just? - Sure. Thank you. Cheers. Can you just give me a minute? Hi. Hey... Can I see? What's that? A bird with two heads. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I see it now. That's really good. Thank you. Why are you drawing a bird with two heads? Have you seen it somewhere before? Oliver? Have you? Where have you seen it? The man had it. Here. Like a tattoo? Yeah. What man, Oliver? What man? The man who shot Dad. OK, mate. I'll get Stu to go through the database, see if he can find a match for the tattoo. Good work. Both of you. So, how did it go? It were bloody knackering. Welcome to my world! - Stick the kettle on. - Right... Hey? So, don't freak out. All right, love? Dad...
