 Pilot, cut your engine. Passenger, get out. Hands where we can see them. Benjamin Siegel. That's right. Who are you? What's the occasion? William Parker, L.A.P.D. You're under arrest for the murder of Abe Greenberg. What do you want? Put me in the electric chair? That the idea, Bill? This is California.

 Here it's the gas chamber, Ben. Cuff him. Some career choice you're making. You're gonna wind up looking very foolish over this. We'll see. Yeah, but you know what? I like gamblers. So after I beat this rap, you should come to Vegas, play my tables, and you'll lose there, too. Mr. Siegel is being held in connection with the slaying of mob informant Abraham Greenberg. I can't say more at this time. This investigation is ongoing. Hey! Busboy's gonna testify. They tried to kill him last night.

 Now he knows who his friends are. Your ride on the Merry-Go-Round made the papers. Page 3. Big deal. It is a big deal, Joe. You could've been killed. Nah. They don't hire guys that can shoot straight. All gangsters have lazy eyes. You seen the movies? Don't make light of this. Who's that? Your bookie? Come on. Chop-chop. We got a witness to transfer. I'm right behind you. Jas, I got to go. Don't brush me off. I can't take you putting yourself at risk for me like this. Just doing my job. You know your problem? You can't take good news. This busboy puts us one step closer to tearing down Siegel for good. Jasmine, you're safe. Only you would find fault in that. I got to go. Damn you, Joe. I knew this crazy bastard was gonna put a foot wrong. Just a matter of time. Give us a minute, Mac. Siegel's stepped in it now, didn't he? Now that he has, what's his is up for grabs, so we grab. I like that, Mr. Dragna. Siegel's boys have been puffed up too long. Like to wipe that swagger off their face. - So we put a few in the morgue? - No, no. We just take them down a few pegs. This is not a war. This is a takeover. I don't want Siegel's boys shooting back. I want them working for us. Understand? Now, keep our guys in line. Make sure they stay on task. You don't know how to follow orders. I told you to back off Siegel, that he was mine. I'll be taking disciplinary action. Captain Parker's running a lot of goodwill with the press and the public this morning. That's something you might wish to consider. I'm not in this for any reason but results, chief. You want the credit? It's yours. Credit or blame? You jumped the gun, Bill. You made a mistake that even a rookie wouldn't make. You arrested a suspect without the facts to back you up. I'll have the facts well in hand by the arraignment. Oh, by noon tomorrow? You didn't know. I can confirm that. Siegel's hearing is tomorrow. - That's not possible. - For the average lowlife. Siegel's got friends in high places. You think they'll let him just rot in a cell while you get your ducks in a row? The thing about goodwill turns on a dime. The press and the public. No, you take this one. It's all yours. And when it backfires, it won't be on me. Give us a minute. Of course, Mr. Mayor. He's right. Publicity is a two-edged sword. Today, they use it to knight you. Tomorrow, they'll use it to cut off your head. Have you given them a reason, Bill? It appears I may have. I've never heard of an arraignment expedited to this degree. Can we get a delay? That's from judge Anders. He plays golf with George raft. I don't. I'm just an elected official with no authority over the court. I guess you've taken quite a gamble here. It's funny. That's what Siegel said. If you want to make enemies, you should pick someone less formidable than our chief of police. And don't ever again put me in a position of having to choose sides. I can't be playing favorites. Understood. Pride and hubris, Bill. They brought down greater men. You've got till noon tomorrow. Those ducks you need to get in a row? I'd get quacking. Sid Rothman... he's killed more people than the plague. If you spot him, you do not take him alone. You call for backup. That's right. No dead heroes, just good police work. Well, you know what you can do with this, right? You all know we got Bugsy Siegel on the hook for murder. Sid Rothman is the glue that makes it stick. We find him, we decapitate the mob in Los Angeles. These are no small stakes, gentlemen. Days like this are why we wear the badge. Now let's get out there and close a door on these bastards. How'd it go upstairs? We got 26 hours to find Sid Rothman and get him to flip on Bugsy Siegel, or this whole thing blows up in our faces. My face. The betting limit starts at 10. Now just go big for the win. Yeah, I got it. That's $20 on Indian Brave in the fourth at 5 to 1. Okay, a late-bet limit starts at 10 bucks. I don't make the freakin' rules, my friend. Scratch your bets, name your filly. They changed the jockey, and the track's all muddy. You tell me. Be lively, now. We're a minute from post time. I want to place a bet. Who sent you? Jack Dragna. I bet 100 to 1 this joint's out of business before the next race. Takers? You can't just come busting in here like that! This is a protected operation!  Protected. Oh, by Bugsy Siegel? All these radios, you ain't heard the news? Siegel's going away for murder. Get that yellow-belly out here. Come on! Jesus. Pissed himself. This place is closed. From now on, you take your business up the street to Mr. Dragna's. You know the place. Except for you. Nobody pisses themself in Mr. Dragna's. - You understand? - Yeah. Cut that shit out! That man ain't done nothing to you! A mouthy moolie. Want to mouth off some more? Grab him. You feeling protected? There's a thrilling second, and they're off! Sammy, whoa. Whoa! Sammy, Sammy... You're gonna kill the guy. Jasmine! Can you do this? Not in heels. - Hey, how's your mom feeling? - Better. Stevie keeps waking her up in the middle of the night, that pooper. He cries all the time for no reason. Babies do that. Hey! You want to play checkers tonight? We could listen to "Ozzie and Harriet." I'd love it, but I may have to work. I'll let you know. Okay, but only if you want to. Mama says I can't be a pest. Your boyfriend was here. I don't have a boyfriend. He said he was. Tall guy, big shoulders, broken nose? He was littler. Bowler hat, kind of creepy? Yeah. But he's gone now? If I'm willing to spill that much of my own blood to get your attention, imagine how much of yours I'm willing to spill. I told you, I don't have any money. Mr. Stax. Always a pleasure. Likewise, Big. Is the lady in? Claire, honey. Some luck, if you please. Just a taste. Thank you my dear. I know you're in here. How? 'Cause your tie is so loud. And I know your brand by smell. You gonna share? I know it's a gift from the boss and all, but, really, that tie is an eyesore. Yeah, but I score points when I wear it. I should pick one out for you. What's stopping you? I'd hate to disappoint the boss. He's got bigger worries right now. A murder charge will do that. Where does that leave us, the people who work for him? That's why I came. To reassure you. Nothing changes. You keep things going here till Ben beats this thing. Until then, Mickey's in charge. Mickey? I know he comes off like a clown at times. It's... taken me some getting used to, I admit, but the more I know him... All of Ben's operations are safe and snug. That's the message. There's a firm hand on the tiller. I suppose one could always use a firm hand on the tiller. Talk me into it. - Hello? - It's Mickey. - Ned there yet? - Yes, he's here. Mickey. Dragna's crew just busted up Smooth Watson's place on Central Avenue. They what? Dragna's got wrecking crews kicking in doors all over town. They hit four of our places in the past five minutes. Now, you tell Claire to boost up her security there right now, bar the doors, load you some guns. Safe and snug? Hey, you hear me? I hear you, Mickey. I'm gonna have to call you back. Go! Hands up! Get over to the wall. Come on! Ladies and gents, I invite you to patronize another fine gambling house right here in Hollywoodland. My associate there will be passing out business cards. Your chips will happily be accepted there while this establishment is closed for renovations. Boys, start renovating. Don't. Hey, everybody, stop! Ace! Go! Hold it, hold it! Stax, what are you doing here? - I work with these people. - You? Well, same thing. What, you know this guy? No, genius, we're complete strangers. Don't go hitting lawyers! Sooner or later, you're gonna need one! You got a sec? Stand down. Ace says hold on a sec. Your boss, Dragna's, making a big move, I hear. Sure. With your man Bugsy in the slammer, it's a green light. Like this? Really? It's what Dragna wants. Your boss is not a clever man... no offense. Will you take some advice? You're not in charge here. Of course not. I've surrendered. Still, the advice is free. You're scaring the hell out of these people. What good is that? They're not gangsters. Look at them. They're a bunch of dentists. You think they're gonna stroll up the street and give you their business after you scared them half to death, pointing guns at them? You make sense. Point them at me. I work for Siegel. It's understood. You can let these people walk out. Turns into a nice floor show they'll talk about later. We all save face. I talk to your staff? Sure. Nothing to worry about here. Big, you stand down. The boss will know you did all you could. Same goes for the rest of the staff. Just let these gentlemen do what they came here to do. What they're not gonna do is hurt anybody. That's right. Except him. Anybody tries anything, Siegel's boy gets it. I know you'd all feel bad if something were to happen to me, so please cooperate. Make sure you grab a business card on your way out. You guys on a break? Keep at it. It's better they break the furniture than people. Safe house. What's so safe about it? Well, nobody knows you're here. Let's start with that. Have you seen this man? Yeah, I seen him. - You have? Where? - In a movie. He slept in a coffin and drank blood. Funny. You won't last 10 minutes in jail. Here, you'll have four men guarding you around the clock. Drapes and blinds always shut. Let's keep the uniforms inside. Don't want the neighbors seeing cops. Get iron security bars in all the windows. That's good. Except that one. That window's a weak spot. Nail it shut. Nice. Nice. Nice. 17 ft, 6 inches. So we just drill down through the ceiling? Next to this electrical junction here. Because Mickey Cohen is blind, he never sees the microphone above his head. The electrical junction is where the ceiling light is. The mike goes into the light. That's why he doesn't notice. But wouldn't that depend on the ceiling light? Yes, it would, Professor. That's why we're glad it's a frosted-glass globe. And you know this 'cause you've been in his office so many times. I know this because of purchase orders. City records, electrical permits... it's all there. All you have to do is check. Of course, that takes patience, brains... Screw that. 27'3"... "X" marks the spot. Taking bets on this? Drill. Dragna... that prick. The minute your back was turned, he hit us every which way. I know, I know. Blake's been filling me in. You don't sound all that exercised over this. - I thought you'd pop your cork. - Why would I, Mickey? I got a secret weapon Dragna doesn't know about. I got you. Sir. Now, why do you think Dragna suddenly grew a set of balls? Me he's scared of. You he doesn't think about. He underestimates you, Mickey. Now, what do you do when somebody throws a punch? You punch back. You make it sting so he thinks twice next time. That's right. So while I'm in here, I need you to be my face on the outside. Use your judgment. Do what you got to do. I got to go. I'm about to lose the call. Nobody said I couldn't use the phone. I'm saying it. - Actually, you have no right. - Excuse me? By court order, our client is entitled to certain amenities while he's in custody. That's quite a list. I ask that phone access be reinstated. If not, we'll file a complaint with the judge. To hell with the phone, the judge, and you. You got a lot bigger problems than a phone, Ben. You're telling me. By the time it got here, the soup was cold. Now, what's on your mind, Bill? This is Lloyd Reese with the city attorney. I'm here to discuss his case. Let me guess... you've got Sid Rothman in custody and he's decided to testify against me and my only hope is to fall to my knees and confess. Good guess. Good bluff. Two things wrong with it, though. Sid is too smart to get caught and too loyal to ever squeal. Nice try. Maybe you don't know him as well as you think you do. Yeah, well, we were pitching pennies down on Lafayette Street, lower east side, when we were 5. Sid even stepped in front of a knife for me, got sliced from his groin to his throat. You can't imagine the blood. Took over 100 stitches and more than a year for him to walk right again. So between the two of us, I think I might know Sid a little bit better than you. And Sid knows that I would lay down my life for him. So even if the gas chamber were thrown in and I had to make a choice between believing you or trusting Sid, sorry, Bill, you lose. I'll see you in court tomorrow. We'll see who loses then. Oh, I'll recognize you. You'll be the guy with the shiny badge and his dick in his hands. And guess where my dick's gonna be. Hey, Stax. Bunny's pissed. Soon as you can, get over there and cool him out. We'll talk later. Sorry for my timing. I've had calmer days. Thanks for meeting here. I'm surprised to get your message. What's it about? Leslie Shermer. I've heard the name. Why have you? Is that blood? His. His idea of making a point. "Money, bitch"? He and Hecky were partners. He wants his cut... $5,000. He thinks I've got it. I know he's one of Ben's. I was hoping you could put a leash on him. I think this dog is rabid. Why not take it to Joe? He'd handle this off the books. And get him in deeper? He was dodging bullets last night. He's done enough. Too much. Good for you. I can't get in deeper, either... with Joe. Closed that door a long time ago. Thought of opening it again. Hurts too much. You ever think about telling him that? Talk about it? Oh, he talks now? He's not the same guy now as when we got back. His edges aren't so frayed these days. And I'm happy for him. He deserves some peace. It's a long road... coming home. He needed some time. You didn't. Nobody came back from the war the way they went in, unbroken. Some guys are just better at faking it, like me. Joe... he had it worse than most. What happened on Guadalcanal? What did he bring home with him? All of it. One thing I'm sure he never told you. The men in our platoon that made it back alive... Joe's the only reason we did. Not a man would've made it off that island if not for him. It's not my story to tell. It's his. Maybe he will someday. It's not a debt. No strings. You get this Shermer off your back. - Everyone's happy. - I can't take that. You can, and you will. It's a gift, from me to you. 'Cause I remember you both when it was better. Thank you. Yeah. What are you hearing? Radio's on, and it's the fight. Louis just tagged Jersey Joe. Grab the reel. Don't turn around. Talk quiet. I have the money. It's in my purse. Just take it. $5,000? Thing is, since our last chat, a little bird sang in my ear. Doesn't matter whom. Just a guy looking for a taste himself. He tells me the deal wasn't for 10 grand. It was for $50,000. That's right $50,000. Hecky was looking to screw me from the start. So now I want the whole whack... all 50k. I don't have that money. I had to beg for the $5,000. But I have something worth $50,000. The pictures and the negatives, they're in a locker. We'll go there right now. I don't have the key. Joe does. The cop? I can get it. I'll need a few days. Down payment. You've got 24 hours to get the key from your cop and cough up the rest. We have a problem. Notice... I didn't say, "I have a problem." I said "we." Smooth Watson. Life was taken this morning by one of Dragna's. Bunny, I'm so sorry. Tomorrow morning, my community will walk through these doors, they will listen to the eulogy delivered by the good reverend, who will say many nice things about the deceased, most of them true. But their eyes will be on me, watching my every gesture, trying to read my thoughts. Right now, the women are pouring their anger into their men's ears. The men are listening and wondering how much ammo to stockpile. - Nobody wants a war. - Yet here we are. A white man's squabble has taken a black man's life. The people in this community don't much care if it's Dragna or Siegel holding the bat that crushed Smooth Watson's skull. The fact that I do business with both of these white men makes me responsible. What do you suggest? A summit. Get both sides to sit down, hash it out. This pot's boiling now. - Can't wait till Ben's out of jail. - You won't have to. Mickey Cohen has Ben's proxy. We could do it here. You'd be neutral territory. What do you say, boys? Feeling Swiss? You think you can pull that off? Them coming down here would show some respect, humility. Qualities famously lacking in both Jack Dragna and Mickey Cohen. I can't speak for Dragna, but Mickey might surprise you. There's more to him than meets the eye. You wouldn't think it, but Mickey Cohen can actually be a very reasonable man. You garlic-eating son of a bitch! Here. Here, have a banana instead? What? You don't like bananas? You work for the banana king of L.A. you'll hurt his feelings. Stucky, peel me another one. I think bananas are disgusting. They make me want to puke. Sammy thimble, right? You caused us a lot of trouble with bunny today, trouble we don't need. What do you do when you get really mad? Throw a pie in somebody's face? No, no, no, no, no. Find me a nice green one. Don't peel it. What are you doing?! What are you doing?! I'm showing you how to have a banana a different way. Be glad your boss don't distribute pineapples. Boys. This thing will blow you in half. I speak from experience. Pistol out. Left hand, two fingers, slow. You don't want me nervous. Slide it over here. You're crazy coming here. Got every cop in town looking for you. Look, I don't know what's on your mind... We'll get to that.
