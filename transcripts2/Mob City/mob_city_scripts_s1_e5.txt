 Mob City (2013): Season 1, Episode 5 - Oxpecker - full transcript 
 Bugsy Siegel is in in jail but and his arraignment is imminent. Carl Steckler, the restaurant waiter who put the finger on the two hoods who were going to testify against Siegel, is in hiding in a police safe house. While Sid Rothman tries to beat Steckler's location out of Joe Teague - and threatening Jasmine's safety in the process - one of his men gets it from a crooked cop. Rothman turns the tables on Teague. With their witness gone, Siegel walks. Jasmine finds herself again threatened by Leslie Shermer but sets him up. Meanwhile Bunny tries to broker the peace between Mickey Cohen and Jack Dragna and threatens a race war if they don't settle their differences.

 [ Joe muttering ] Jasmine: Hmm? [ Sighs ] Joe. Hey, Joe, wake up. [ Grunts ] No! [ Gasps ] Joe! [ Breathlessly ] Stop! Stop! [ Sobbing ] Don't! No! [ Sobs ] No! No. [ Sobbing ]

 It's just a dream. You're back from the war. You're home! [ Sobbing ] Please, please, let me help! Oh, my... [ Gasps ] [ Sobbing, panting ] What did you do? [ Crying ] [ Telephone rings ] Yeah? Say again. Connection's bad. Man: I got an address -- 1014 north wilcox. You gotta knock -- three short, two long, three short. Sure about that? Sure I'm sure. Make sure no cops get hurt. And this is the last time, understand? I'm done. Whatever you say. [ Phone thuds lightly ] [ Paper rips ] [ Groaning ] [ Handcuffs click ] [ Sighs heavily ] Just tell me where you got the busboy stashed, then I'll be on my way. He's in Carmen Miranda's hat. [ Chuckles ] The reason you wanna tell me -- if your stoolie makes his court appearance tomorrow, I'll tell all your cop pals who really killed hecky Nash. Yeah, that's right. I know more about what happened in that oil field than you think... Enough to put you away for all time. The shoe's on the other foot, right? Interesting. Just do what you gotta do. Baseball fan, huh? You see, uh, Brooklyn's got a colored guy playing for them now? Personally, I never had a problem with the colored. Black, white, yellow, whatever -- they all bleed red. [ Grunting ] Someone's out there. I think he's watching the house. Man: Come on, Max. Come on, boy. Good boy. His dog just took a leak. I'll call for backup. Stop it, already. You're making him jumpy. Yeah, you are. Yeah. [ Sighs ] Sleeves are too long. You don't have to look prefect tomorrow, just respectable. [ Sighs ] My whole life, I never turned stoolie -- not once. Now look at me. A squealing rat in a cop's borrowed suit. [ Slow, instrumental music plays on radio ] [ Radiator creaks ] Sid: Why you making me do this? You don't even know this Carl steckler. [ Groans ] Come on. It's just us talking. Why is a stoolie's life worth so much more to you than hecky's? Why don't we just save ourselves the trouble, huh? Say we fought this one to a draw. That what this is -- a draw? You can't sink me without sinking yourself. Well, my boat's already taking on water -- murder charge, racketeering. I got two torpedoes in my bow. I got nothing to lose. You, on the other hand, you're a mystery... At first glance. You don't care about money... Or getting beaten. You don't even care about going to jail. Guy like you, a fella's got to dig a little deeper. Dig deep enough, sooner or later comes the one thing that does matter. So, what's it gonna be, soldier boy -- the stoolie or the girl? [ Slow, instrumental music plays ] [ Knock on door in code ] You're early. Well, we were told 9:30. Hell [Chuckles] we thought we were late. Relief's here, boys! [ Clears throat ] Man: Good night, Carl. Good luck in court tomorrow. Yeah, thanks. Must have hurt -- losing a woman like this to a nothing like hecky Nash. [ Grunts ] Especially a guy like you who serves his country with such distinction. [ Grunting loudly ] Silver star, two purple hearts. [ Grunts loudly ] You son of a bitch. I'm not mocking these. I got respect. [ Gasps ] [ Photo album clatters ] Hecky Nash. You ever dwell on that, knowing that a walking toe fungus like him was banging your woman? [ Grunts ] Still, you go to these lengths to protect her. That makes you either the biggest sap that ever drew breath or her the best piece of ass. [ Panting ] You touch her, and I will kill you. You hear me? Come on. We're just talking, huh? Your arm's gonna rip off before the radiator does. I'll kill you! Then help us both out! Give up the stoolie! [ Grunts ] [ Telephone rings ] [ Panting ] Yeah? Man: You owe me a case of scotch. Oh? Stay on the line and listen. [ Slow, instrumental music plays on radio ] You'll like what you hear. You guys hungry? I made chili. Hey! Grab some utensils. [ Gun cocks ] [ Grunts ] [ Clatter ] [ Gunfire ] [ Gun clicks ] Man: Carl, back of the house! Move now! [ Gunfire ] [ Glass shatters ] Jack?! Jack! [ Shell casing rattles ] [ Grunting ] Jack! [ Grunts ] [ Gun clicks, shell casing rattles ] [ Gun cocks ] [ Glass shatters ] I won't talk! I swear, I swear! I ain't no rat. I ain't no rat! I-I won't talk! I won't talk! [ Choking ] No, no, no! No! No! No! No! Don't kill me. Don't kill me. Don't -- [ sputters ] [ Groaning ] [ Gunshots ] [ Panting ] [ Screams ] [ Groans ] [ Screaming ] [ Groaning ] [ Screaming continues ] [ Groans, glass shatters ] [ Gun clicks ] [ Panting ] [ Panting ] Looks like we skinned this cat another way, so, uh... Never mind. [ Grunts loudly ] [ Grunting ] [ Knock on door ] Jasmine: Joe? Are you all right? [ Weakly ] Jasmine. Jasmine, run! Inside. Now. Joe! Oh, my God. [ Telephone tapping ] [ Chuckles ] Operator, give me the police emergency. Tell them the neighbors are fighting -- somebody's trying to kill someone, this address. Woman: Police emergency. It sounds like a murder happening next door -- 1155 arcadia. Please hurry. [ Replaces receiver ] Jack dempsey, nice job. You even chipped a tooth. [ Fabric rips ] [ Sighs ] Take that. The photo album -- you don't want the wrong people should see it. I could keep quiet about it myself. Depends on how friendly you're willing to be from now on. [ Keys kingle ] Give it some thought. [ Door opens, closes, radiator rattles ] [ Panting ] What? We just gave him what he wanted. What -- a bloody nose? An alibi. [ Insects chirping ] [ Sighs ] [ Sirens wailing ] [ Handcuffs click ] [ Panting ] [ Keys jingle ] [ Sirens continue ] Hey. Get out of here. Go. Go now. Go... [ Sirens approaching ] Sid rothman. There's a warrant out for me. I'm surrendering peacefully. That's him. That's our apb! I got a gun under my left arm. I got a permit for it. [ Grunts ] [ Handcuffs click ] [ Handcuffs click ] That's him! That cop lives in this building! Joe teague -- he kidnapped and tortured me! I want to press charges! I want to press charges! [ Camera shutter clicks ] It was rothman. He was in my apartment when I got there. He tried to beat this place out of me. Yeah, what'd you give him? A split lip for his trouble. Medic: We're ready. So much for not killing police. Seems the [Sighs] rules have changed. That door swings both ways. Mike: Damn right. When do we start handing out payback? No. That's how horrall's goon squad does things. We'll get the animals who did this by using real police work. Anybody who steps out of line gets busted to traffic division. Just keep your heads in the game. We've got a court date tomorrow and a dead witness. If we don't come up with something, Siegel's gonna walk. We've still got tug. If he makes it, he'll I.D. The shooter. If he does that, it takes us back to Siegel. That's a lot of if's. Every way we turn, it's another dead end. Post guards at tug's hospital room. Let's help him live through the night. [ Knock on door ] [ Sniffs ] The witness died. [ Chain lock rattles ] He was trying to climb out the bathroom window, but I had it nailed shut. It was our one blind spot. That doesn't make it your fault. Yeah, jas, it does. I was gonna give you hell about that photo album. Now I don't have the heart. Don't move, don't move. This will sting. I know. [ Inhales sharply ] I'm out of wisecracks, Joe. I'm terrified. Sid knows about us now. He's bugsy's right hand, and that's too close for comfort. You heard what he said. He's not gonna use it against you, he's gonna use it against me. He wants to make me his pet cop. He doesn't know you very well. Does he? [ Sighs ] Any ribs busted? No, I don't think so. Man's got skills, knows how and where to hit you, just so hard. I was stupid, and you're paying the price. Whatever trouble I'm in, I got myself into it. Nobody else should have to suffer, especially not you. Not like this. What are we doing? What's it feel like? It feels like trouble. No expectations beyond tonight. Can you live with that? Lighten up, boys. [ Taps table ] Right here. They'll be locked in the safe during the summit. You get them back when you leave. All parties may frisk all parties. [ Metal rattles ] I'm sympathetic to your grievances, but I can't be caught in the middle of them. I'm not the one trying to muscle in on someone else's rackets. [ Clears throat ] They're not yours. They're Ben Siegel's, and he's finished. You see the morning paper, hmm? Cops got nothing! You better pray that it stays that way, because if Benny's gone, you're gonna have me to deal with. You know what a oxpecker is, Mickey? It's a loud, little bird that rides around on a rhinoceros's back picking off pests. That's what you are. Without Ben, you're nothing. You think you could take me, hmm? Come get me, you dago bastard. Gentlemen, we're not here to settle all your differences. We're here to assure bunny that you won't settle them in his community, and to compensate his loss. I have always spread my business fairly between the two of you, but I won't be bullied into choosing sides. Convenient for you. Middle of the road is a precautious place to be. I disagree. This is a big city. Now, you can fight in Beverly hills, you can fight on the sunset strip, but if you bring the fight to central Avenue, I'll shut you both out. Now, I'm willing to make less money in exchange for peace. Are you? That's a bluff. No. You have bruised egos and property damage. Me -- I have a dead man and a lot of angry people. If you don't want a race war on your hands, take me at my word. Yeah, your guy getting killed, it was against my wishes. Nevertheless, smooth Watson's family lost a breadwinner, and there will be funeral expenses. The right gesture here will ease a volatile situation. [ Sucks teeth ] [ Whispering indistinctly ] I'll agree to a truce for the sake of business. I'll pay five grand to the dead man's family and half the property damage, but I ain't paying for no moolie funeral. [ Grunts ] [ Chuckles ] No offense. I'd never live that down. [ Sighs ] That's it. No deal. Think. You represent Ben. You already made your point. You already pushed back. Now's an opportunity. Yeah, to rip this prick's balls off. To be the bigger man. Solidify friendships on central Avenue. [ Chuckles ] Mr. Cohen will also pay $5,000 to the deceased's family and agrees to the split on damages. Oh. As for the funeral, it's on him. Mr. Cohen will pick up the entire tab. Money's easy. This here's the hard part. Tell me about it. Joe: That's great. Yeah, that's great news. When did they say he's gonna come around? Tug? He's gonna live. I want to be there when he wakes up. If we can connect that safe-house shooter to bugsy, we nail his ass in court. We'll do it today. That's it? The big hope? Well, we got other things in play. Like what? The guys put a bug in Mickey Cohen's office. How the hell did they get into Mickey's office? Drilled down through the roof, put the mic in a ceiling lamp. They hear anything interesting yet? Oh, they sure have. Got hours of him yelling at the wait staff. But it may give us something. You never know. [ Keys jingling ] Crying out loud, jas. Don't look so trapped. What ever happened to "no expectations"? That still goes... If that's how you want it. You need to know I'm not that guy anymore. No more dreams about the war? Less these days -- a lot less. I notice I didn't get strangled to death in my sleep last night. So we'd call that an improvement, right? [ Chuckles ] [ Chuckles ] Look, jas -- you and me. I'd... I'd do it again -- all of it. If you don't feel the same way, we can be done the moment I walk out the door. Sure, Joe. Maybe you'll get a job selling vacuum cleaners, and I'll learn to cook. All right. [ Sighs ] [ Door closes ] [ Inhales deeply ] Velma? Here, honey. We all are, partner. Fat Jack? Nick: He didn't make it. Tug. Tug. About the attack... There were two... Dressed like cops. You dropped one of those bastards. What about the other? I sh-- I shot him... In the leg, I think. His face -- describe his face. Blurry. What? Blurry. I lost my glasses. Never saw... His face. Sid rothman assaulted one of my officers. That's got to count for something. He claims your man kidnapped and assaulted him. He's ready to press charges. Let me guess. He walks -- he drops those charges. Gentlemen... Do you really want the extra publicity of playing "your word against his" with sid rothman in open court? I've taken beatings before. Let it go. [ Indistinct conversation ] Your honor, given the lack of evidence, we move that the state drop all charges in this case. [ Spectators murmuring ] Woman: [ Crying ] Oh, my God. Your honor, reluctantly, the state has no objection. [ Camera shutter clicking, spectators exclaiming ] [ Scattered applause ] Man: There he is -- Mr. Siegel! Mr. Siegel! I'm the victim of a gross injustice. These cops -- they are the lowest kind of thugs, and Parker is the worst of them. They've got a vendetta against me. These so-called "public servants" do anything they want anytime to anyone. Next time, it could be you... Or even you. And they call us criminals. There's a joke. Now, if you'll excuse me. Horrall: Embarrassing day for Los Angeles. Mayor bowron and captain Parker have seriously fumbled the ball. If I were them, I'd be wondering how to explain this to the people of this great city. We felt we had a strong case, but it didn't pay off. You want to call this a gamble, you call it mine. Siegel was arrested on my authority alone -- not the mayor's, not anyone else's. I take full responsibility. [ Reporters clamoring ] Gentlemen. Reporter: Siegel's lawyers hailed the dismissal as a victory for the justice system. Word has it that bugsy is considering a lawsuit against the city for harassment and naked abuse of power. L.A. cops, huh? More like keystone kops, you ask me. Not those wine glasses. What is this, rabbis'-and-old-ladies' night? Hey, you, bigger with them floral arrangements. And no tulips -- this ain't no funeral. What about whores? Benny can't celebrate without whores. Yeah, Mick, we got whores. What about picture gals? We got enough? We need lots of pictures taken tonight. I don't know. Uh, should I check? No, I'll do it. Hey, dummy, can't you read?! Sorry, Mr. Cohen. Didn't see it was you. I apologize. What's that red light for? So we can see in here without the prints getting damaged. Red's the only kind of light doesn't hurt 'em. Every darkroom has that? Yeah. [ Chortles ] What do you know? I seen the light. Joe? What am I gonna do with you? Hey. We're having fried-egg sandwiches. Aren't we, honey? [ Eggs sizzling ] [ Radio chatter ] [ Indistinct sports commentary on radio ] Sit. Except for his one, Robinson is unbeaten. I saw your cop spent the night. You get my locker key? Why is she here? I'll kill her if you don't do what I tell you. Simple enough? Key. Allow me. [ Grunts ] Aah! [ Groans ] [ Panting ] Aah! That hurt! Good. Key. Pocket. You got what you came for. Now leave. I haven'tgot what I came for. I'm still owed 45 grand, and you're gonna help me get it. Get it? [ Gasps ] Get dressed. Fix your hair. We still got a few hours. Where I can see you! You got nothing I ain't already committed to memory. I was out on your fire escape all night. You need a hobby. I told you, I'm the silent partner in this deal. You're gonna make sure I stay that way. You're my new middleman. The last guy who had that job wound up dead. Hecky was stupid. This time, it happens in a public place. I got it all figured out. You're gonna call Siegel and say what I tell you. My friend Joe -- you know, the cop? -- he tells me they've tapped Siegel's phones. We do it your way, you're inviting extra guests -- the kind with badges. Don't say I never did you a favor. How, then? A singing telegram? The clover called. They want me to work tonight. Mickey's throwing Ben a welcome-home party, and he wants lots of pictures. I'll go in and talk it over with Ben in person. "Ben"? What's your in with him? You're looking at it. Busy girl. You're way better at this than hecky. I made a list -- all the people who knew about the safe house. Mike: Someone on this list sold us out -- got tug shot, got fat Jack and our witness killed. I see my name's on the top of that list. Not alphabetical, I guess. In order of most likely. Maybe rothman beat it out of you, and you just won't admit it. That how this gonna be? It's how it is. [ Thunder rumbles ] Don't be long. "Pumpkin" might miss her bedtime. [ Mid-tempo, instrumental music plays ] Here you are. Mickey's looking for you. Brother, he's in a mood. Are you in some kind of trouble? [ Snaps fingers ] Mickey's office. Now. [ Switch clicks ] [ Radio static ] Jasmine: You said i should come to you if I had any idea who took those pictures. Mickey: Really? All this time goes by, and suddenly you want to talk to me about pictures? That's awfully decent of you. I can't wait to hear your, uh -- your what-you-call -- your insight -- you being such a picture-taking expert and all. Say, for example... What a red light is for. I'm waiting here, legs. [ Scoffs ] You know, you boys make me dizzy -- you and your stupid games. Excuse me? No, I won't excuse you... Or hecky. Is this what you're grumbling about? It's yours. Go screw it in a socket. You gonna blame a girl for getting caught in the middle? Fine. But don't kid yourself it's anything to do with me. This is about you and hecky being shitty friends. If you'd been kinder to him and he'd been less greedy with you, none of this would have happened. You're gonna turn this on me now? Hmm? We're past that. You're right. I lied to you about the pictures. What choice did I have? It gets worse. I made prints... And duplicate negatives. Sid: [ Sighing ] I'll stay calm. Just tell us what you want for them. Pest removal. I'm on my way to pick up the pictures right now. You get there ahead of me, you'll see the pest I'm talking about -- Leslie shermer. Ring a bell? He was in it with hecky. Now he thinks the money should be his. He sent me here to set a drop -- the pictures for the cash. 50 grand? Not 50 cents if you play it right. You get the money, the pictures, and your wayward boy. Why you gift wrapping this guy for me? [ Static crackles, line screeches ] Once he gets that money, I'm as good as dead. It's not just blackmail anymore. He's kidnapped a little girl to get me to play along. That's the gas chamber for him if he ever gets caught. Gift wrap him? [ Chuckles ] I'll even put a bow on him. He's agreed. They'll be there at 9:00 with the money. Get going. I want to be there plenty ahead of them. [ Engine turns over ] [ Gun cocks ] Don't be stupid. [ Gun clicks ] Here's where she gets out. She doesn't know your name or where we're going. She gets out now, or I hit the gas and crash us into that black-and-white up there, just to see what happens. [ Engine revs ] Go and tell the policeman to take you home. It's okay. It's okay. Go on. I gave you that. It's nothing but corpses since you showed up -- Phil holtz in church, hecky Nash, little moe and Jerry two-tone, fat Jack and Carl the busboy in the safe house that you set up! You forgot the black dahlia -- I sawed her in half. I'll fit her in. [ Telephone rings ] Tell them to call back. Detective teague. It's eddy. I think that girl of yours has gotten herself in bad trouble. Right. You alone? Not much. Okay. I talk. You listen. But you're gonna owe me some real answers. Agreed? That's fine. This just came in over the bug in Mickey's office. Listen. Jasmine: But it gets worse. I made prints... And duplicate negatives. Sid: I'll stay calm. Just tell us what you want for them. Jasmine: Pest removal. I'm on my way right now to pick up those pictures. If you get there ahead of me, you'll see the pest I'm talking about. That's it. When was this? This was three minutes ago. Two minutes ago, rothman and some goons hightailed it out the back. [ Telephone slams ] Hey, you got something more important? Than listening to you blow hot air? Matter of fact, I do. Joe, this ain't right. There are too many questions that need to be answered. Nick, you got no cause to believe me, but I did not put your partner in the hospital. It is as simple as that. Joe, you walk out that door, you're -- we're done here, hal. You'll have to draw on me if you want to stop me. To hell with you. Don't lose him. [ Body thuds ] Almost home free. Get the pictures out, make the exchange, and then it's frisco, here we come. I'll be watching you. Anything goes wrong, it's your life.
