 I wish you'd just tell me. What do you want? I want my keys back. Before I change the locks. The body they found in Berkshire yesterday was Agent Walker. - Oh, my God. - I know. I'm helping Sam with the Reid regeneration project. It's the Green regeneration project. - Green, as in Lizzie Green? - Mr Reid insisted, because of all the hard work I've done on it. - Get me that music box. - We know who bought it. The Russian. - Marat Milankovic. - I need it back. Find the house, find the guy. Find the guy, find the music box.

 Find the music box... Well, then we're done. If we find that, we're good. Take me with you! For one day, I'm not safe. I'll give you anything. Anything? Well, no-one's following us. I think we're gonna be all right. This had better be good. It's Agent Walker's car, ma'am. It's on the move. So find it. Why am I out of bed? The two men driving the car were with Walker moments before he died, ma'am. OK. So who are we dealing with? On the left. Samuel James Pinkett, 29, works for Berkshire County Council. To his right, Philip Neville Bourne, 31, works in the council building, but not for the council itself. Where's my coffee?

 - Any previous? - No convictions, ma'am. But we can connect them to nine incidents in the last 48 hours. Holy shit! Who are these guys? We're still piecing that together, ma'am. Walker picked them up outside the house of Scarlett Stevens just after she reported the death of her husband Nick. Then at 23.10, we have them handing over something to this man. Lionel Lau, organiser of an underground gambling ring, together with a whole... Yeah, OK, when does this get interesting? At 1.15am, they arrive at the  address of Marat Milankovic, who was the subject of Walker's surveillance. Why was he watching this guy? It's possible that Milankovic had some intel... We don't know. Walker hadn't filed any reports. - Is Milankovic with them now? - We don't know. Are they working with the Russians? Don't tell me, you don't know. - Milk and sugar? - Neither. I've already put the milk in. Anyone want one with milk? Take the lead on this, Paul. And use these two, they seem to have it well covered. Yes, ma'am. OK, kids... ...meet your targets. The last agent who got too  close ended up in a body bag. So find them... watch them... keep your distance. These guys are probably armed... and definitely dangerous. What are you doing? What? I was quick! You were ten minutes! You have to heat them individually. You don't have to. You don't have to buy them. I'm not eating a cold Jinsters, Sam! - Ginsters. - Jinsters. - Ginsters. - Jinsters. - Ginsters. - Jinsters. - Ginsters. - Jinsters, it's Jinsters! Right, I'm not doing... Just drive, we need to get him to the hospital. No, no, no hospital. They will look for me there. Don't worry, Marat, we're gonna patch you up, all right? Drink that, it's isotonic. Oh, Philip, is that you? Hiya, Mum! Oh, where have you been? - Oh, my Jesus! - Who's... He's bleeding! - Mum, he needs your help. He's been shot. - What? - We can't take him to hospital... - Have you been hanging out - with that Neil West again? - No, no, no. - I'm calling the police. - Mum, listen, no, we can't, OK? Mum, listen to me. Mum, listen to my voice. - Shooting. - Listen to my voice. - Yes. Yes. - Breathe in through your mouth, and out through your nose, in through your mouth, out through your nose, in through your... out through your... I'm trying to do the right thing. You have to trust me. Right, get him into the garage. I don't want any blood on the good settee, I'll get my kit. - OK, this way, this way. - Shoes off. Shoes off, guys. Shoes off, shoes off, shoes off. What's his name? Marat. OK, Marat, I think this might hurt a little bit. What is that? Tiny town? No, it's a model railway! Marat, there's no exit wound, I think the bullet's still in there. Aaaah! Have you done this before? No. But you don't spend 12 years in A&E; without seeing your fair  share of gunshot wounds. Wow! How many have you seen? Two. - If you count this one. - Aaah! You trying to kill me. No, no, no, no, it's us. We're trying to help you, remember? Petr tried to kill me. That's right, and we helped you, yeah? You... you... ...you my rent boy, mmm? He's delirious. Have some more of this. Mmm, yep, that's it, drink it down. Shh. - Aaaah! - There, I can see it! Hold still, hold still! - Aaaah! - Hold still, hold still. Got it! Bandages! You're amazing, Mum. Go and get some bedding from the bedding cupboard. I need to pop out for a few minutes. Are you OK? I'm fine, I just need some air. If you could just sit up, sit up. It's Pinkett. Shit! But why? Don't know, really. We never used to go on holiday so... ...me and my dad, we made this. We called it Michaelton Phillage, cos his name was Michael, and "Phil" sounds a bit like "village". Well, you know, the first bit. Here you go. This'll replace all your fluids and salts and whatnot. - It tastes horrid, but... - Thank you. Do you know where is my phone? Oh, actually, I did see a phone somewhere. Mum, be careful! What is that? It's a music box. Try and be careful! Calm down, Philip, please. See, there is a phone  there, you see. Look! Thank you. Well, don't play music now, he needs to sleep. It's a lullaby mum, it's perfect. The number you have dialled is not in service. Please check... Hey! Sorry, I didn't wake you up, did I? I can't sleep. You know me - terrified. I've got this big speech tonight, there are all these people gonna be there. You'll be amazing, you always are. - Oh... - Sam, um... I don't wanna talk about it. Us. Every time I do, I seem  to make things worse. I just wanted to give you the keys back. I'm sorry it took so long. I'll see you at work, then. OK, let's go. Wait, he wants us to wait. All right? Yeah, I just needed to... Oh, no, what happened? Mum dropped the box. The song kept getting stuck, - so I'm trying to, you know... - Take it to pieces? No, fix it. She'll notice if  the song sounds wrong. Maybe it was like that before. I mean, you don't know what you're doing! It's just a matter of straightening the cogs, that's... Oh, that's fine. That was meant to. It's a USB stick. This is what she wants. He said it himself - this is worthless. This is the key! We need to find out what's on this! No, we don't. That's only gonna make things worse. - What we don't know can't hurt us. - She's framing us for murder, Sam! Who knows what else she's capable of?! Exactly! Unless we give her what she wants. Now put it back! You can't put the genie back in the bottle. Well, of course you can. That's where the genie lives! Ahh, I'm hungry. We're gonna fire up this bad boy. - Ooh! - Right, it's obvious what this is. - We don't need to... - Right, well, it's on now so... It won't let me copy it. Why do you want to copy it? For clues. Just shut it down, this is clearly a personal... Hang on, I recognise him. From TV, something like a culture programme or sports show. Marat has had Shreddies, but there is Crunchy... It's not... We weren't watching it like that, that's not what it is, we were... It was for research. What did I tell you? What did I tell you about  watching mucky ladies? They're not happy. No, they are not happy. Do you think they're happy, Sam? No, Sam doesn't think they're happy. Now, don't be surprised if, when you come home from work, that computer is no longer in this house. Mum! No! We need to put this back and get to work. We don't know when she's  gonna show up looking for it. What are we going to do today? What? He's a bit old for work experience, isn't he, Phil? Yeah, he's re-training. Oh, right, what did you do before, mate? Baker. - Sign him in. - Cheers, Len! Chyort. Chyort! What's the matter? My contact, he doesn't answer. Who's your contact? MI5 man. He said he could protect me,  but his phone is dead. Is his name Agent Walker? Yes, Walker. You know Walker? Oh, well, sort of. We did. He's dead. What? Are you serious? - Dead? - Yeah. Who's dead? - Alan - What?! Hmm. Yeah. Alan passed away last night. - Oh! my God! - Morning! Not that Alan. It's another Alan. I'll be up in a minute. Right, you take him to the mail room. Don't tell anyone his name. - OK, yeah, I know. - I need to reach MI5. OK, I'll do it. - And I need a new bandage. - I'm on it. It's this way. Come on, this way, OK? It's all right. Shhh. Hello, um, I'm not sure if this was the right number to call... - What's the nature of the threat? - No, no threat. What it is, is I've got someone who was meant to talk to one of your agents who recently... sadly... died, um, Marat Milankovic. Please hold. Hello. Sam? Oh, hello, Sam. Someone just put me through to you. No, no, no. My name isn't Sam, I'm saying, "Hello, Sam. I know who you are." - Is Milankovic safe? - Yes. And has he told you anything or spoken to anyone, or written anything down? No. And you've not been in  contact with anyone else? - No. - OK. Good. And where is he now? He's with me. At work. I work at Berkshire County Council. Do you think you could  come and get him? I think we'll meet somewhere neutral, if you don't mind. Take down this address. Be there at... ...two o'clock. Goodbye. OK, you heard. Pull out now! Sir, Milankovic is in there. There's no CCTV inside, just a camera on the rear entrance. Caretaker comes out the back every 20 minutes for a smoke. We go in. Grab Milankovic, bring him out for questioning. Well, let me ask you a question, Sumner. Do you think this guy is more likely to yield information under duress in a government facility, or of his  own free will in a public location? - Well... - Pull out. Now. We're meeting MI5 at two. Good. Did you nick that from mine? Yes. Invisible ink! Old school, nice! What is it? FSB used my secrets against me. But I have secrets too. Who's it for? You. I give it to you. You keep safe. Tell no-one. Not a plaster, a bandage. - Well, what's it for? - It doesn't matter. I need to put something on the accident form. Put "gunshot wound". Does anyone know what's happening with this banner? It was supposed to be delivered this morning. Yeah, they called about that earlier. There was some sort of problem, but I've sorted it. I asked them to deliver it straight to the town hall. - Oi, Sam! - Thank you. Just let me know if you need me to do anything else. Sam, there's a fittie at reception for you! Sounds like you're pretty busy. - What's all this? - Girl to see Sam downstairs, and she is smokin'! Smoking in the building? She can't do that. No, Alan, she's hot, she's smokin' hot. How hot? Really, so hot... gas mark... buck, yes. Hi, Kev. I'm not denying anything. Neither am I confirming it, I've answered your question as best I can. Absolutely typical. Lying Brussels puppet. Can you turn this off? What? No, I'm watching it. As soon as we have the results of the consultation, I will make a decision in conjunction with my colleagues - at the Department of Transport. - And when do you expect that to be? As soon as a decision is made, you'll be the first to know. So who's to blame for the decision being delayed again, Minister? Oh, good Lord! It's not a question of blame but of due process... "Good Lord." ...this is a very delicate issue and we're consulting with numerous... Fit! Not for me. - Oh, yeah? What you into? - Nicki Minaj. Kev?! Sam! Sam! Phil, it's Culverson. It's Kev! I saw a man here I thought  was Kev and it isn't Kev! What are you saying? Oh, my...! Ahh! - Argh! - Yaaah! Argh! Ya-ya-yay-a-yayya! Yay-a-ya-a! Argh! Who are you? Who are you working for? I'm a town planning and  noise guidance adviser... ...for Berkshire County Council. No running! Sam Pinkett! Well, this is it. We're early. OK, we wait. Can't believe I've never  been up here before. Have you not? I used to come here all the time with my dad to fly my kite. I'll never forget, it got caught  in that tree down there and I was laughing so much, watching him trying to  get it out with his shoe. And then his shoe got stuck and he was trying to do it with his other shoe, hopping round in his socks. And you see the big tree there, in the middle of Priory Park? That's where him and my  mum had their first kiss. It's where we scattered his ashes. That's where me and Lizzie first kissed. In that ASDA car park? Well, no, not then. It was a roller disco. - Yes! - Remember? Yeah! We used to go down there every Saturday night. Gel my hair up, put on my sleeveless Puffa jacket. - Like you're Michael J Fox. - Back To The Future, yeah! They are here. Glad you came. You made the right decision coming to talk to us. Mr Milankovic and I need to have a little chat. You two can go, wait in the car. Sumner. Thank you. Thank your mother. Stay strong. Bye, then. And you, beautiful boy... ...do not ever change. OK, thank you. Why do you need our protection? I know names, and locations of many Russian agents based in Western Europe. Where did you get this information? I tell you what... ...if that rail link did happen, all that'd go. My dad's tree, the park, everything. The worst thing is, the town wouldn't even get the benefit. Train won't even stop here. It's just gonna plough straight through. Well, it isn't gonna happen so don't worry. Then how do I know it's genuine? FSB seems to think so. All I'm saying is, if I was a railway planner, which in my own small way I am, that's exactly what you'd do. You'd go through the park, through the hospital, through both schools, past the garage... Right, well, Reid owns all of those, they're all part of the development so... So it could still happen. I was talking to Agent Walker. - He believed me. - I believe you. And you're talking to me now. Why would Jim Reid go to all the  effort of getting Lizzie to co-ordinate a huge regeneration project if he thought he was just gonna have to sell it to the government for... Oh, my God. Have you told anyone else about this? No. And you've not spoken to any other intelligence agencies? No. They're bribing the Transport Minister. They've... they've bagged all the right land to sell. And he couldn't have  done it without Lizzie. Have you written anything down? Of course. - Why? - One copy, for insurance. He'll get rich, and she'll get the blame! What are you going on about? It was the Transport  Minister on the sex tape. Culverson, I saw him on the news. Tell me where it is. Why do you need to know that? That's the name of the programme I couldn't remember. You couldn't remember the name of The News?! I need to know right now. The evil old bastard. We've got to warn Lizzie. No! Start the car! Fuck off! Where are the documents?! What?! The documents he gave you - where are they?! We don't know what you're talking about! Tell me where they are, and everything will be OK! It's a setup! Don't let them get away! Oh, my God, they've killed Marat! They killed Marat! Did he say anything to you  about any documents? No, I don't have a clue what  he's talking about. They killed him! Oh, my... Who is that?! Oh, shit! - Put your foot down! - It is down, Sam! Put it down further! Who is he?! I don't know! How would I know?! Oh, my God! Faster! Oh, shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! Stop! No! - Seat belt! - What? Seat belt! We've lost them! Something's not right. Oh, no, we've shaken them. This is it! We're clear! This is us now! We just keep driving. We drive this road. This road is going to take us all the way to Mexico City! Aaaaaah! Samuel Pinkett! Philip Bourne! We have you surrounded! Give yourselves up! - This is it. - Yeah. We nearly did it. Didn't we? We worked it all out, we were that close. Open the doors slowly, step out of the car... ...and put your hands on your head! We made a great team, you and me. I want you to know whatever happens, I don't regret a second of it. Agent, do you have a shot, over? Yes, sir, I have the shot. On my command... ...take them out. Roger that, standing by. I'll give you three seconds! Three... Two... - OK, let's do this. - Do what? - Get down! - ...one! No!
