 The Wrong Mans (2013–2014): Season 1, Episode 6 - Running Mans - full transcript 
 Thanks to some nifty driving by Phil the pair escape from Smoke and jump a train to bring them back to town. They turn up at the council's big gala dinner with the evidence to trap Scarlett and her father but are side-tracked when Smoke abducts Lizzie and threatens to kill her unless he is given the documents Marat gave the boys. This leads to a show-down with MI5 agents firing off against each other and Phil and Sam literally caught in the middle. However right prevails and it even looks as it Sam will be getting back with Lizzie.

 If you are not here by five o'clock, we will kill your wife. This is our moment! We've been chosen! You're not going anywhere until you've finished that research pack. I just need to print it out. Guys, who wants to go go-karting? No-one wants to go go-karting. I'll come. What do you want? I want my keys back... before I change the locks. Is Milankovic safe? He's with me. At work. I work at Berkshire County Council.

 I give it to you. You keep safe. Tell no-one. They're bribing the transport minister. They've bagged all the right land to sell. He'll get rich... and she'll get the blame! You should all have received your invitations to the gala dinner... We've got to warn Lizzie. No! Start the car! - Where are the documents? - What? The documents he gave you, where are they? Down! We make a great team, you and me. I want you to know, whatever happens, I don't regret a second of it. OK, let's do this. - Get down. - What? No! Phil!

 Phil! What? - What are you doing?! - What are you doing? What are you doing? - What are you doing? - What are you doing? OK, I'm pulling out. Engage the target. Aaaaaargh! Aaaaaaaaargh! There's no sign of movement from the vehicle. Damn it! Well, don't just stand there! Go and find them! Yes, sir! Right, you two, with me. Come on, let's go. Move! We can't see a thing down there. I'm switching to thermal. - Get down, get down! - What? We have a visual. Two targets heading north-northeast. I'll send it to your screen. Yeah. That's them. Hold your position. OK, they're coming to you now. 50 metres. 40... 30... 20... - Now! - Freeze! - Freeze! - Stay where you are! - Freeze! - Hands where I can see them! You're in danger, don't move! Stand down! Get on the phone to Thames Valley Police. We need every officer in the county on the lookout for these guys. I can't run any more! - Come on! - I can't. I'm sorry! No! No way! I don't think we've got a choice! We'll climb onto the bridge and we'll jump on three. - This is stupid! - It's stupid if we don't! - OK, on three, all right? - OK... One... two... three...! - You didn't jump. - Neither did you. Has Sam turned up? What do you think? Phil, give me your phone. Why? They can trace it. I only got it two weeks ago. Phil! It'll be fine. Phil, come on... I don't want to go back to a Nokia! Please! Do you know where she is? - Da. - OK. - Do it. - Da. Thank you, everyone, for coming. You've got... Thank you. Um... It's slowing down. I think we should get out. Really? We can't just keep running. They're professionals. They'll find us eventually. But where are we going to go? We have to go back, warn Lizzie about Reid. But then they'll definitely catch us. Scarlett said... We've done nothing wrong, Phil, nothing. The more we run, the guiltier we look. We have to go back, because innocent people don't run. No, they don't. They stand up and they say, "Bring the noise, mother..." Don't start. Let's get out of here. Where do you think we are? You're not going to believe this. Who wants to go go-karting? Do you understand? Watch the lights. Notifying all units. Be aware of two wanted men in the Berkshire area, Samuel Pinkett and Philip Bourne. Do not approach without backup. We believe them to be armed and dangerous. Oh, late as always. Two things. One, it's black tie. Two, council employees only. You don't work for the council. You just work in the building. Piss off, Noel. Come on, we've got to find Lizzie. You know what, Pinkett? This is just the latest addition to a major file of disciplinary offences that I've been compiling. - May I? - Be my guest. Oh, God... I've always wanted to do that. Oh, Sabrina... Noel needs some first aid. - Nice suits, gentlemen. - Cheers, Alan. You, too. - Where's Lizzie? - I dunno. Sam... Can I help you? We'd like to talk to you about the music box. Well... I really am most grateful to both of you for returning it. Scarlett was very worried. I hope I haven't made too much trouble for you? Must be nice to be treated like a hero. Everyone queuing up to shake your hand. Well, if you've got something to say, I suggest you say it. I have. We know what you're doing. All of it. It's been a strange week, hasn't it, Phil? I'll say. We've met some bad people, but you're the worst... ...cos you've given everyone hope... that they can stay in this town and have jobs to feel secure in and schools and shops that don't shut down. And it's your town. How can you sell it all  out for a bit of money? You're right. This is my town. You're so... You're so... Stupid! What? Did you really think that you  were going to come in here and make me change my mind? Intimidate me? Blackmail me? - You... - Don't you dare! You haven't got a leg to stand on. We've seen the sex tape. Oh, oh, the sex tape, he says. Oh, well, let's see it. Ah... But you don't have it, do you? You've got nothing. Zero evidence. Don't usually go down  too well in a court of law. They're such sticklers for things like... well, I don't know, um... ...fingerprints on a murder weapon. Now... This is you... ...and this is me. Sam, have you seen Lizzie? No-one's seen her. She's supposed to do her speech in five minutes? How long's she been gone? She went to the toilet about half an hour ago. That's a record, even by my standards. Lizzie... Lizzie? Lizzie? Lizzie? Lizzie! Give me your phone. I don't have a phone. Someone threw it off a train. Give me your phone. Um, what do you need it for? To make a phone call. Right. Can you get them to call you? It's just I'm on pay as you go along, and I don't have much credit left, so... Hi. Just before you say anything, I'm using someone else's phone, and they don't know how much credit they've got. But they can receive calls. So if this cuts out, just call me back. Don't worry, Sam. What I have to say to you won't take longer than... Sorry. You utter clown. What have you done with her? You saw what happened to Marat. I will do the same to her if you don't bring the documents to Brimpton Airfield within the next half an hour. What documents? I don't have... I will kill her. What documents is he talking about? He's still asking us for documents! I mean, what documents does he think we have? Have you asked him what type of documents? I don't know! I haven't seen any documents! He might mean these documents. - What the hell are those? - Marat gave them to me. And you didn't think to bring this up before? He told me not to tell anyone! - Sam, what are you going to do? - I'm going to give him what he wants! Well, wait. We can't do that. We don't know what he's planning! - I don't care! - Hang on. We can get the upper hand. I know Brimpton Airfield. James Wallcroft's house virtually backs onto it. This is real now. This is Lizzie's life. This might be bigger than that. We don't know what's in those documents. Listen to me! Listening to you was the  biggest mistake I made! I wouldn't be in the middle of all  this if I hadn't listened to you! Right, you're emotional. OK, but you cannot let that rule your head. You need to lock it up and hold it down! Shut up! I've had enough of your shit! They've got Lizzie! My girlfriend! - I thought you'd split up. - Oh, my God, you're an idiot! It's like being with a child! You have no idea what the real world is like! - I thought we were friends. - We're not! Well, maybe I'm yours, but that  just puts me top of a list of one! I'm only nice to you because no-one else is. You're a prick, and I'm done! Sam... Leave me alone. You are so fired for this, Pinkett. Oh... What are you doing? I'm borrowing your car. No, give that back. 563 to base. I've located the, er, go-kart... Hiya, Mum, it's me. No, no, no, I'm fine. I'm just checking in, see if... I'm, fine, yeah, yeah. - I haven't been out. I've got plenty in. Have you been eating properly? - Are you all right, Boo Bear? - Mm-hm. Hands behind your back! It's all right. Let them have their moment. I'm so sorry, I'm sorry... - Sam, what is going on? - It's going to be fine. - What are you mixed up in? - Please just trust me. - Things'll be OK. - OK. That's enough... That's enough! Have you got the documents? Oh, God, it's blank. Not again. You have to believe me, I had no idea that... That's all I've got! That's what he gave... So, everything... everything's OK? We... we... we can go? Yeah, she can go. That's absolutely fine. You're staying. Why? Well, I need to check that you haven't made any copies. I haven't. How could I have? It's blank. I'm nothing. I'm literally nobody. If you've been watching me... Yeah, I've been watching you, I've been watching you... ruin everything that  I've been working for. Yeah... you have no idea the damage you've caused. We had it all worked out, and you... you ruined everything. When I get on that plane, I can never come back here... ever. You did that! I have to leave my family without saying goodbye because of you! I didn't do anything! I certainly didn't made  you a... double agent. No! - Armed police! - Police! Stand down! Don't move, don't move! Stand down! - Drop the weapon! - Let him go! Put your guns down now! Do as he says. It's over, Paul. Let him go. We'll cut a deal. Forget it! How could you do this? Oh, come on! You know how it works! They spy on us, we spy on them. Nothing actually happens. - I just got played by both sides. - You killed Walker. Collateral damage. Now, I'm going to get on that plane, and he's coming with me. I haven't got my passport! Don't do it, Paul. We'll have to shoot. - What? - I don't think so. Collateral damage. That list of names is worth more than this kid's life. Hang on, what are we saying here? - Take aim... - Don't take aim! Don't make me shoot him! I will shoot him! I will never put this gun down! Stop! Stop! - Don't make him shoot me! - I am serious! I will shoot him! - I'm going to shoot him now! - Stop! Stop! What is he doing here? What the hell is going on?! Sorry. I don't... I don't know why I didn't  drive the whole way... God... - Phil... - It's all right, Sam, I got this. This is a copy of the files. Not just one copy. Hundreds. I watched Marat do it, and I copied every single word. It took 63 lemons, but it was worth it! So if Marat's right, it means you'll be held responsible for leaking these names. So go on. Go on, do it. Get on your plane. Be my guest. But you'll be killed the second you land. Or you can let Sam go... ...cos it's over. We won. And you lost... bitch. He's right, Paul. Think what would happen if it went public. The safest place in the world for you is here. Put your weapon down! Put your hands on your head! Put your hands on your head! I am not dead! I am not dead! - Sam! - Phil! Sam! Sam! - You got shot! - Did I? Oh, yeah! It's unbelievable! You took a bullet for me! That's what friends do. I'm wearing a bulletproof vest. I wish you'd told me that before. At least I know why you kept disappearing from work now. Yeah. Sam... ...watching you... what you went through tonight, for the last few days, it's just been... amazing! I've never seen you like this before. And it's made me realise there's something I've been meaning to tell you. You're fired, Sam. What? Look what you've done. Well, it wasn't exactly my fault! No, no, in a good way! Look what you're capable of. You said yourself you hate that job and you're only staying because of me, or us. You need to get out there and do something, and that's never going to happen while you're stuck at the council. That was good work, Philip. That's the army. We don't really do that. Oh. Pretty good trick, with the blank pages. Well... I learnt from the best. We would honour you publicly, but I'm sure you'll understand these things have to remain top secret. I only wish there was some way of thanking you. Yeah... About that... Mr Mayor. Thank you. Thank you. Now, I grew up in this town. I went to school here. My kids went to school here. And if I'm fortunate enough to have grandchildren, I hope they will, too. Everybody here should have a home that they can be proud of, a job they can be secure in. And if I can play some small part in that, then I'm a lucky man. But, you know, really the credit for this should be going to Lizzie Green. Lizzie, who spearheaded this project... Hold on a minute. Oi! You might want to watch this. Er, Len, do you think we need... ...end the speculation about this, and we have listened to the public and we have decided to announce today that the high-speed rail link is, in fact, not going ahead. Oh. Yes, yes! I think we're all speechless. Um... It may be my name on the project, but it's his name on the cheque. Seven and half million  pounds of his own money and years of work... Everyone, Jim Reid! What did you do? Who? Us? Did you enjoy it, Phil? Watching me fucking that snail, Culverson? - A bit, yeah. - Yeah, I bet you did. Well, I hope you've remembered it because you're about to spend a lot of lonely nights in prison. It's your word against ours. It's your blood on the carpet. And it's your fingerprints on the murder weapon. Are you saying we're going to be convicted for a crime we didn't commit? Like the A-Team? - You killed him. - So what? The truth doesn't matter if you can't prove it. - I think we just have. - Is that enough, fellas? What? Scarlett Stevens, I am arresting you for the murder of your husband, Nicholas Stevens. - You have the right to remain silent... - No, no, no. No! Good work. You would have got away with it, too... If it weren't for us pesky kids. - Danger Mouse. - Scooby-Doo. - What? - Danger Mouse. - It's Scooby-Doo. - It absolutely is not. Don't be ridiculous. "My wings are like a shield of steel." - Don't bring Batfink into it. - It's Danger Mouse. That's exactly what Danger Mouse is! I will bet you £100 pounds it's Danger Mouse. OK, you're on, because it's Scooby-Doo! Sam! Sam! Are you not going to stay and celebrate? It's going to be quite a party. - It's council employees only, and Phil... - Just works in the building. - OK. - That's why I'm going to hang with him. OK. I've been thinking about what you said. And you were right. So I quit. - Well, you can't quit cos I fired you. - I was going to hand my notice in anyway. No, you weren't. Oh, I almost forgot. You're not changing the locks, then? Yeah, no, I might... Let's see how it goes. - It is Scooby-Doo. - What? I'm just saying. You're right. It is Scooby-Doo. Well, you owe me £100, then. - No, I don't! - A bet's a bet. Yeah, we didn't shake on the bet. A bet's not a bet unless you shake on the bet. And that... is a schoolboy error, my friend. All right, best friends. OK. This isn't a "thing" we do now. You don't have to say "best  friends" every time... - All right, we'll just do it this once. - OK. Best friends. Oh, you've got to explode it! If you don't explode it, it doesn't mean anything! We've already been through this. You go in... and then we go, "Boom"... We go in and then you go, "Boom." OK? All right. In and, "Boom." All right. Best friends. Boom.
