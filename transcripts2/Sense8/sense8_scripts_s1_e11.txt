 Yes... you're going to die here. What? God, what? Nomi! Wh... What is it? They know what she is. They're gonna cut her open. They're gonna turn her into a Bolger. We gotta do something. Bu... What? We need information. We need to know if BPO has been alerted, if someone's made the diagnosis... I could hack into the hospital in a second, but I don't have any equipment. They took everything. Can't you... use your police codes or something and call them? - Is that the cop? - Yeah. I was suspended. - Great. - What?

 - He got suspended. - Great. What do we do? I... I wouldn't answer that. No one looking for a fugitive would knock like that. Bug! Hello, Angels. Bug, what are you doing here? Feds are funny, you know. They spend all that money protecting things that nobody cares about. Then they leave the real information lying around like a Post-it note on a refrigerator. For instance, when they confiscate illegal electronic equipment, it's inventoried to a site... that's like a shopping list to a guy like me. So... Thank you, baby. So when I saw exactly the things that I had just sold you posted, well... the Bug suspected foul play. Oh, I... I don't have any money to pay you, Bug. I didn't come for money. I'd still be in prison if it weren't for you, Mike. I mean Nomi. Nomi. Look, I don't know what kind of fight you're getting yourself into, but... I do know... you can't shoot back without any bullets in your gun. So... consider yourselves... reloaded. Oh... Hey, partner. What's up? I thought we agreed we'd be starting tomorrow. We did, but, uh... there's something I have to do, and I need a favor. Who's this? Hey, beautiful girl. I'm Jela. What's your name? I'm Amondi Kabaka. Nice to meet you, Mr. Jela. I was hoping she could stay here with you. I believe someone else will come by later to collect her. Where will you be? If it gets too late... here is the number of her French teacher. She will know what to do. Capheus... where are you going? I have to settle a debt. You're coming back, aren't you? Van Damme always comes back. Take care of her, Jela. I will. Hey, Van Damme. See you tomorrow. The doctors are saying it's a miracle he's still alive. I'm not sure which would upset my father more: the idea of fanatics trying to kill him, or a god getting credit for saving him. How is your mother? As he improves, she becomes convinced... that it's because she's praying again. She wants to go to the temple with you. Rajan? I know you want to get back to the hospital... It's actually nice to get outside, so thank you. Though I am a little nervous about what you've been wanting to talk about. It's about... something I didn't tell the police when they questioned me about the attack on your father. It had no bearing on what happened. It was... a private matter. As such, I felt that I should tell only you. Your father did not want us to get married. He told me that he had reconsidered and asked me to say no to you, for your own good. He thought that we were not well matched. What did you say? There was no time to say very much of anything. How difficult it must have been for you to hold all this inside. I thought it was important for you to know. A lesser woman would have said he wished us well, that he wanted us to be married no matter what... and he gave us his blessings. And I would have known that she was lying. You knew he was against our marriage? Of course. So is that what I was to you? - An act of rebellion against your father? - Never. I told you the truth. Maybe it added a bit of spice to my attraction to you, but it has nothing to do with why I asked you to marry me. I want you to marry me, not to be for or against anyone else, because I love you, I trust you... and I can imagine no better life than growing old with you. All I need to know now is... after everything that has happened, do you still want to marry me? OK, I fixed it so that any information, requisition or test that goes out with her name on it will look like spam to other computers. Great. So she's safe. I figure they would've moved her somewhere more secure if they knew, like they did to me. - Her poor father. - Yeah. He's been there the whole time. How is she? She's still in the ICU... but she's not alone. You are a smart man, Van Damme! Come on out. Eh? It's empty! Where is she? Amondi. Where the fuck is the girl?! She has nothing to do with this. Bullshit! She's Kabaka's daughter. She's just a child. He killed my sister. I'm here because you have a quarrel with me, not my mother... and not a child. Let us settle our debt... like men. Like men? Like men?! Like men?! Like men! You are hilarious. I like you, Van Damme. Come! Walk! You have a visitor. Sun... No touching! Sister... it's good to see you. What are you doing here, Joong-Ki? There's no easy way to say this. Last night, Father was very upset. He was drinking. You know how he can be. I told him to go home. He said he couldn't. He said he was a failure, that he deserved no home, that he deserved to die. I couldn't listen to him anymore. I left. I wish to God I hadn't, but I did. I have to live with that mistake. We had a meeting this morning. He never showed up. I had everyone looking for him. I had a lunch... when the police showed up. They found him. He was in his car. A hose connected the exhaust to the window. But the police are wrong. He didn't kill himself. It was shame. Like a kind of cancer. Shame killed our father. Sun... we cannot blame ourselves, OK? What happened was beyond our control. But I didn't want you to hear it from someone else. That's why I had to come myself. I'm so sorry. At least... we still have each other. You killed him. You... killed him. Sun... I know this is a terrible blow. He was going to tell the truth to the court, so you had to stop him, because you're afraid of prison. Sun... do not say something you're going to regret. The police said it was a suicide. You murdered... our father. I was nowhere near him. OK... obviously, you're upset. Help! - Hey! Hey! - Help! Look at me. Look at me, Joong-Ki! I know what you did. You will pay. I swear it! Superpower! Bring out the bitch! We've been trying to house-train her, but... once a street bitch, always a street bitch. Keeps pissing herself. See... I was going to make this bitch watch me as I killed the only thing in her life that mattered. But... I have a better idea. I want you to do the honor and put this bitch out of her misery. You do it. You cut her fucking head off... and we'll call our debt even. It's a little dull. You might have to hack a few times... but you can do it. You are Van-fucking-Damme. Do it quick! Come on, Van Damme. Like a man, huh? Like a man! What's the problem? I'll tell you the problem. The problem is... you aren't a man. You're just another bitch! Bitch, come on! It's you or him, bitch! Call me a bitch one more time... and I will kill you. Say what? Bitch! Aah! Aah! Van Damme. Fucking Van Damme. What the fuck are you doing here? Find them! "What's best in life? Crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and hear the lamentations of their women." Thank you. - Thank you. - No... it's we who should thank you. - This means so much. - Yes, so much. Remover of obstacles. As the obstacle to our faith was removed. - What are you... talking... - She is our hero. She brought him here. - No. - Yes. God worked through you. - No! - Yes. You brought the defiler to us. You brought him where we could reach him at last. No one likes violence. God does not like violence. This is obscene! But he knows... sometimes it is necessary... No, don't touch me. You have nothing to be afraid of. - You are one of us. - Yes. - Yes. - No! You're one of us! Don't touch her! If I see you... any of you, here again, I will show you what violence looks like. Let's go, let's go, let's go. Come on, come on! Let's go. Thank you. They'll be back. - So will I. - Well... so will I. This is India. Wow. Uh, where are you? Chicago... sort of. Sort of? My thoughts aren't really there. They're with her. I remember listening to music. Yeah, her father was playing with the orchestra, and it triggered something in her. - What is wrong with her? - I'm not sure. I'm afraid that soon they'll realize what she is. And then? I don't know. - Are we clear? - I don't know. Van Damme... Capheus, thank you. Thank you for not giving them Amondi. I'm going to make you a rich man. I don't want your money, sir. You can keep it. Tell me then, why did you save me? To be honest, it wasn't exactly a part of my plan. Oh, no! Any weapons in here? Knives, guns? No, no, I don't have any weapons. - Capheus! - What is it? What's the matter? I think I'm about to die. Nobody's gonna die. Buckle up! Move, move, move, move. Move! Fuck! Move, move, move! Sorry! Shit! Oh, shit! Shit! Is he gone? Let's settle this. Aah! You will take good care of him, you understand? If anyone comes looking for a man matching his description, you say nothing, you do nothing, you call me. How long will it be? What I have to do now... shouldn't take long. What name should I use? Conan. Is that a first name, a last name? Yes. Try it. Nice. Capheus! Capheus... Ah! Capheus! Oh, my God! I knew you'd come back. Van Damme always comes back. Papa, are you all right? I'm fine. No, I'm better than fine. I'm lucky. - Who loves you? - You do. I've never seen anything like it. The growth of the substantia alba. I'm so cold. Here, take my coat. No. No! I can't believe she can even move with what we've given her. Kids today have huge tolerance for drugs. - Did we hear back from the neurologist? - Not yet. Still waiting. Did you do that? It was easy. Hacking's what I do. Did you do this, too? How'd you get access to the Australian fugitive alert? I'm an all-access kind of girl. Looks totally real, doesn't it? I figured it would buy us a little more time. That's the question. How much time do we have, how much time does she have? None. You're out of time. Jonas. I told you I made a mistake. I wish there was some way to fix it, but there's not. I was just afraid if I didn't help you, you wouldn't be alive right now. That's not a mistake, that's true. No, the mistake was mine. I should've trusted you. The real question we face is, can you trust me now? Yes. Even when I tell you that Whispers knows about Riley? How? I have all the information locked down. You know about her and Will knows about her... and I know you. And Whispers... knows me. Be careful what you tell them. Not too much, or they won't believe you. He's here with me now. He wants me to tell you that he's going to Iceland, that he's going to find Riley, and once he does, it won't be long until he finds the rest of you. And why would he tell us that? Why not just go straight to Iceland or have Riley arrested? Tell Will I look forward to meeting him. Don't underestimate him, Will. He's very good at manipulating people. Right now he's smiling because he knows the only thought in your head is getting on the next plane to Iceland. This is a bad place. You should not be here. You don't have to do this. You could just... turn around. It is so simple a thing, just... just turn the wheel, and the future changes. - It is not that simple. - It is. You stopped your wedding, but it's still going to happen. You don't know that. Some things in our lives are inevitable. Don't do this. They will kill you. There are worse things than dying. Wolfgang, please! There are things I will never be able to understand about your world, just as there are things you will never understand about mine. I understand how I feel about you. And somehow, I know that you feel the same way about me. This is why I'm here. After what I did... as long as that man is alive... no one I care about will ever be safe. It's Wolfgang. Crying won't help him. I can feel what you're feeling. This is what life is. Fear, rage, desire... love. To stop feeling emotions, to stop wanting to feel them... is to feel... death. What do you suggest I do? I take everything I am feeling... everything that matters to me... I push all of it... into my fist... and I fight for it. Sync and corrected by Elderfel www.addic7ed.com
