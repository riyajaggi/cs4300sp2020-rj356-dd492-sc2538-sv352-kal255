 Sync and corrected by Elderfel www.addic7ed.com It was the same woman from my dream, I'm sure of it. The same face. You gotta stop watching all those cop shows. They will mess you up. I feel like I know her, I just don't remember from where. Maybe someone from your criminal past. - I wasn't a criminal. - No. Activist. Hacktivist. - Reformed, paroled, legal. - Uh-huh. And what about all these security companies that you hack for? Well, it's not hacking if you get paid for it. Anyway, I thought I knew her from one of my client companies,

 but no, that's not it. You've led a lot of different lives. - So have you. - Me? I've been working at the same bookstore since you met me, but not for much longer if I don't shake my ass. Oh... Wait, wait. OK, but tell me honestly, am I sounding crazy? Maybe you should write about it. I am. Well, it is that time of year. You always go a little crazy at Pride. You know why. Honey, if I had your parents, I'd be more than a little crazy. - I'd be homicidal. - Mm. You got a funny look in your eye, Will.

 You hot for me or somethin'? I know I'm USDA prime cut, but you should know I don't swing that way. Thanks for clearing that up. Ain't gonna be good for my rep having no 5-0 sittin' bedside. Yeah, it's not helping me much either. So you think you own me now or somethin'? No... What I did for you I would've done for anybody. So what, then? I was just thinking about what you said in the car... about your dad being shot. Long time ago. Things ain't no different. My dad was shot. Dead? Some parts of him. Finished his career. Cops get shot, hear about it on the news all day. We get shot all the time, but we don't mean nothin' to nobody. Will, tell me about your gangsta days. My kid? My fuckin' kid? What are you thinking? Shoplifting, for Chrissakes? You know who I am? Do you? The matter with you? I'm sorry. I don't know what he's thinkin'. Hey! Hey! This fuckin' kid. You picked the lock? My dad was always workin'. I was always waitin'. Not much else to play with at a police station. Yeah, Will, you know you gotta teach me that trick. All right. I should go. Hey. I don't owe you for what you did... but you should know I won't ever forget it. I've been thinking about my life, and all of the mistakes that I've made. The ones that stay with me, the ones that I regret, are the ones that I made because of fear. For a long time, I was afraid to be who I am because I was taught by my parents that there's something wrong with someone like me. Something offensive, something you would avoid, maybe even pity. Something that you could never love. My mom, she's a fan of St. Thomas Aquinas. She calls pride a sin. And of all the venal and mortal sins, St. Thomas saw pride as the queen of the seven deadlies. Wolfgang! He saw it as the ultimate gateway sin that would turn you quickly into a sinaholic. The greatest box man in the world! But hating isn't a sin on that list. Neither is shame. Come on, Dad. Time to go. I was afraid of this parade because I wanted so badly to be a part of it. So today, I'm marching for that part of me that was once too afraid to march. And for all the people who can't march... the people living lives like I did. Today, I march to remember that I'm not just a me. I'm also a we. And we march with pride. So go fuck yourself, Aquinas. Hell, yeah! You OK back there? - Mom, she's up. - Oh, thank God. I was sure he was gonna be in a coma the rest of my life. How you feeling, Michael? My name is Nomi. Oh, I'm sorry. Your mother's been calling you Michael. What kind of name is Nomi? Have you ever heard of anyone named Nomi? You were Michael before you came out of me, and you will be Michael until they put me in my grave. Mom, come on. She almost died. Serves you right. You shouldn't be riding on motorcycles. Do you know how many people a year die on those things? Where's Amanita? She left. She wouldn't have left me. This hospital only allows family into critical care. She is my family. Please, Michael, this isn't your blog. This is your life. I think that you should go. I'm not going anywhere. I'm your mother and I love you. It may be on my terms, but I do, so I'm not leaving here until you talk to Dr. Metzger. You still want me to go after he tells you what he told us... then I promise I will leave you alone. I'm not crazy. - Didn't say you were. - Yeah, but... You didn't believe me either, not about the woman, the building, the stash, none of it. Maybe you'll believe a camera. Building across the street has got a CTV. I requisitioned the file. This camera's got a perfect view of the front and back. Anybody pulled a body out, we'll see it. OK, this is about the time we pulled over because I thought I saw that woman, right? Ooh, the blond ghost in her underwear. I think she visited me last night. All right, here it is. What the hell? This has been erased. - Somebody erased two hours of this. - That is weird. Man, D, something is going on here. I'll give you there's definitely a flag on the play. Hey, yo. Check out our man here. Uh-huh. He saw the whole thing. This is what a normal, healthy brain looks like: two distinct, well-differentiated frontal lobes. The problem begins here in the substantia alba of the frontal lobe. These two masses are growing into one another. You see? There's no separation. It's often misdiagnosed as acute encephalitis, but it's a condition called UFLS: undifferentiated frontal lobe syndrome. - All acronyms are scary. - Yeah. I'll be honest with you, Nomi, is it? It's not good. There is a procedure to treat UFLS, but it requires a very aggressive surgery where we go in and try to cut away the growth. Oh, my God. The surgery is also incredibly expensive. You're going to need to use our insurance. - Mom. - These are just the facts, Teagan. And if I don't have the surgery? Without the surgery, the tissue will continue to metastasize. Patients will begin to experience a deterioration of mental faculties. It's common for them to experience very intense, very real hallucinations and synesthesia that precedes a loss of memory and a complete occlusion of identity. He told us if he didn't operate immediately, - you could be dead within six months. - Jesus Christ, Mom! You understand now, Michael? You're going to need us. - You're going to need your family. - Don't touch me! You are not my family! - We should go. - This is for your own good, Michael. Don't call me that! - You're my child. I love you. - Go! Just... Just go. At the premiere with one of the rising stars in Mexico, Lito Rodriguez, who was recently voted one of the sexiest men in the world by En Fuego. - Congratulations, Lito. - Thank you. And the second time we've seen you with Ms. Velasquez, isn't it? What are we to make of this? Are you guys an item now? - We're just friends. - Good friends. OK. Good friends. We like hanging out. He's an amazing dancer. Oh, it must be your Spanish blood, right? - His father taught flamenco. - Oh, he was from Barcelona, wasn't he? Bilbao actually. But he taught in Barcelona. He was a true artist. But let's be honest, Christina, when we're out on the dance floor, nobody's looking at me. Who could take their eyes off her? He's a keeper. And the movie is Love Has No Boundaries But Death. Well, the truth is, she never even looked at me, not once. I felt like a stalker, waiting in the cafeteria for a chance to ask her out. I was sure that she didn't like me. But my father taught me that fortune favors the bold, so I decided to send her flowers on her birthday. Lots of flowers. Oh, my God, Kala. And that got me a chance for a date. Kala loves the movies, so we went to see A Match Made by God. Of course, Auntie and Sister came along. And when Shah Rukh Khan sang "I See God in You," and I saw tears in her eyes, I hoped more than anything I've ever wanted... that one day she might feel that way for me. Aw! I told you I had a surprise for you. I like this man. I really do. You have no idea what's going on, right? So you just kinda have to, like, let go and go with it. And Lito, you... You're so good. I'll tell you the truth. Sometimes when we were shooting, I was a little bit confused. Am I this twin here? Am I that twin? No, no, no, but you make it work. You carry us through. I mean, there's only like one, maybe two problems. What? - She's horrible. Horrible. - Come on. Don't know what's more fake, her acting or her tits. - No, seriously... - You're terrible. No, you don't even worry when the ship goes down, you know she's going to float away safely on those things. And afterward, she came up to you and you told her how great she was. How do you even do that? You know, you just look them right in the eye and you lie. It's what we do. It's called acting. Speaking of... would you like to come upstairs and... run some lines with me? I can't. I have an early call tomorrow. - Really? - Yeah. I am not used to men telling me no. It's kind of turning me on. - I'm sorry. - Are you sure? - Yeah. Yeah. - You sure? You sure? - I'll see you tomorrow. - You sure? - Really? Are you sure? - Yeah. Good night. Mm... Are you hot? Whoo. I'm burning up. It wasn't hot until Rajan started dancing. - He was good, wasn't he? - He is awesome. Trust me, if you don't marry him, I will. He's so cute. Whoo. I think locking my keys in my car was the best thing that's happened to me in a very long time. I'm hungry. I can make something. No, I have a real craving. For what? Indian food. Sanyam, sir, the food was unbelievable. - Really, everybody was blown away. - Yes. - Thank you. Thank you. - Yes, it was very good. Even though I don't much like Indian food, but it was good. I'm more than willing to help with the wedding if... Oh, no, no. That won't be necessary. We're bringing in finest chefs from Europe and Asia. We are good. They say the only thing people remember about a wedding is the food. - Yes. - Well, if it's going to be as good as yours was tonight, then the wedding is definitely going to be unforgettable. What is unforgettable was your song. Yes, it was the highlight of the evening. Thank you, Auntie. Did you like it? I did, very much. Sir, is it all right if I say good night? Yes, yes. Go on. Yes. Thank you. Are you awake? Are you awake? Don't lie. Are you awake? Are you awake? I am now. Mm... How'd it go? I don't know. It was OK. They liked it? Yeah. You know, it's a premiere. They have to like it. They liked it. I told you they would. A lot of people were confused about which twin survived. Well, that's the whole point. The uncertainty of our own humanity. If they don't get that, they're just fucking idiots. You make it sound much better than it is. And what did Ms. Velasquez have to say about it? - It was fun. - Hm. Let me guess. She was complaining the whole night about Ana's breasts. But you didn't pick her because of her insight into genre fiction, did you? No, no. I have someone else for that. - Yeah? - Yeah. Who is that? - He's amazing. He's very sexy. - Mm? Super smart. And he does something that drives me crazy. - When he's reading... - Hm-mm. and he's really into it, he touches his glasses and wrinkles up his nose at the same time, like this. Look. Every time he does that, I fall in love with him. Well, he sounds great. Why not take him... to your premieres? Come on. I'm sorry. You know I'm just jealous. I just want to be your armpiece. Why be jealous of the arm, when you already have my heart? What movie is that from? I forgot. - Well, it's... it's quite good. - Come on. I've been thinking, it might be time for someone else. Why? Do you think Daniela knows something? No. I think she just wants what she cannot have. Mm, damn right. It's mine. I had a really nice time. Me, too. I'm just trying to figure out if this is it, or you know... if there's more to it. I'm not looking for a relationship. What are you looking for? Wolfgang? Wolfgang? Hey. Is there someone else? No. Hey, just friend. Daniela? Mm... Uh-oh. I was sleeping, Daniela. What are you doing here? I couldn't sleep. I brought company. Oh. - You have to go home. - Lito. Lito, if you don't let me upstairs, I'm gonna fall asleep on this doorstep. Oh! Oh, no! Are those photographers? Hi! You know I never say no to bubbles. OK. Well, our families got on very well, as far as anyone can get along with my father. My family can be complicated. Come on, we both know who's got the easier job as far as in-laws go. Kala, I sometimes feel your hesitation. I know there are a lot of things that might seem like they're separating us. Things like family, religion... you can sing, I can't. Not true. It's true we grew up in separate worlds, but the only world I want to live in is one where we can be together. - Good night. - Good night. Open the door, Lito. This is not a good idea, Daniela. I was sleeping. Please, we'll talk tomorrow. Come on, Lito. You're acting like a girl. Mm... Daniela... Daniela... We need to talk. OK? Talk. - Later. - Daniela! I've been thinking, um... I need some space. Lito... I know where you're going with this. I'm sorry. You can break up with me tomorrow. Daniela. - Please... - Even though I don't know why you would. Everyone says we make a fantastic couple. Please... It's true. But, you know, sadly... my heart belongs to another. That's cool. Daniela! Dani! This is not gonna work. This isn't work. It's just a little harmless sex. No. - Dani... - So come on. Dani! Dani! What is the problem, Lito? The problem is, honey... that you don't have a cock. Hernando, my friend... good one! Oh, come on, Lito. Look at her face. She totally knows. Knows what? Fan-fucking-tastic. What? Oh, this is perfect. And it's so fucking hot I can't even stand it, and... We need glasses. I'm confused. I think perhaps I misjudged Ms. Velasquez. This is gonna be perfect. This... It's gonna be so good for you. I mean, you obviously need someone you can trust, right? Someone who can deflect the rumors? And if you know anything about me or my family, it's that I had to become an expert at doing such things. Oh... And what do you think you're gonna get out of this? - Are you kidding? - No. This? This is like a dream come true. Ay... Time for your medicine. Why is the door locked? - It's hospital policy. - What? Forget it. Look, I've decided to check out, so you can, you know, - send my bill to my mom's insurance. - I can't do that. OK, fine. I'll pay cash. Dr. Metzger's the only one who can release you. You can't keep me here against my will. Oh, I'm sorry, but we can. Dr. Metzger and your family signed the papers. What? It's for your safety, Nomi, as well as the people around you. Take your medicine. I'll have you know I've had a few psychic experiences myself. Nocturnal emissions don't count as psychic phenomenon. Seriously. This one time I was walking my dog, and this guy goes by, totally innocuous, thin, scraggly beard, didn't look twice. But Ditka suddenly goes nuts, snappin' at him, barking like crazy. Couple days later, I see a sex offender warrant out for the guy. Oh, yeah, yeah, I believe it. You know, there's some things animals can sense going on that we can't. It should be noted that Ditka licks his balls all day. And, if left alone, will also eat his own shit. OK, boys and girls, settle down. All right everybody, come on! Come on! Come on guys, let's move it! We have a visitor from our friends in Washington, so eyes and ears. Agent Stiles. Sorry. I know a lot of you guys have seen me lurking about, and it's not because I'm a butterscotch-bacon donut addict. Thanks very much, guys. The truth is, I head up a federal task force for Homeland Security, which basically means I'm here to help you guys catch the bad guys. This guy is one of the worst. Jonas Maliki. Goes by a lot of different names, - Jonas Barnett most recently. - What? - He's wanted for murder... - I think know that guy. - How? - I'm not sure. If he's still here in your city, we need to know, and we need to know now. Nomi? - You have to get out of here. - How-How did you get in here? If I try to explain it, you wouldn't believe me. But you will. You... You were at the parade. I was. I came looking for you. Oh, my God. Metzger said I was gonna start hallucinating. Dr. Metzger's operation is designed to lobotomize you, and part of you already knows this is true. We all know when people are lying to us, we just don't want to listen. The minute Metzger entered this room, a voice inside of you told you to run. Right now you need to listen to that voice, and get out of here. Uh... Hello? Amanita, is that you? Oh, my God. I... I'm losing my mind. You got some sack of balls comin' in here. Hey, he's still my kid. After what he did, I'd disown the fuck. Can I talk to you? - You buyin'? - Yeah, sure. - Round for everybody. - All right. Step into my office. - I ain't drinkin' no traitor beer. - I'll take his. - What? - Beer is innocent. It don't take sides. You take my beer and I'll fuck you up. This goddamn thing's been givin' me grief all day. Do me a favor, Willy, go take a shit for me. Yeah, I get it. You're pissed off 'cause I did my job. I tried to save that kid's life, Dad. I'm just... I'm gonna go. What? Sit down! God, you never had a sense of humor. Come on. You did what you felt was the right thing. I'm proud of you for that. But if this punk ends up killin' somebody, well then, you gotta live with that, not me. But you know that. You didn't come all the way down here to talk about that. This isn't easy to say, but I... I think you might be the only one who's gonna believe me. Something's going on, Dad, and I think it's got somethin' to do with Sara Patrell. Oh, boy. You're actually out of your fuckin' mind. I'm beginning to wonder. Look, forget about what you did with that gangbanger. Forget about what these guys might think of you. If you bring this girl up, you start talkin' about her again, they'll drag you into psych evaluation over the next six months. They'll run you off this force quicker than you could scrape dog shit off your shoe. Let her go, Willy. Let her go. Don't. It's just in your head. Don't answer it. Hello? Oh, my God, it worked! - I found you finally. - Amanita? I knew they had you on 18, so I tried every room. Oh, my God, where are... Where are you? Here in the hospital. They wouldn't let me see you. There's a ton of security on your floor, but I knew Lola worked here - and she gave me her code. - Gotta be quick, Neets. Listen, Nom, I saw your crazy bitch mother. I don't know what she thinks she's doing here, but... It's not just her. There's this doctor. Yeah, Metzger. He signed your papers. He said that there's something wrong with my brain. And Neets, bad things have been happening. What things? I've been hearing things and feeling things and seeing things. Neets, I'm so scared. It's gonna be OK. Something is going on. I don't know what it is, but until we do, I will burn this building down before I let anyone touch that beautiful brain. God, I love you. But what if he's right? Metzger said that I wouldn't be able to tell the difference between a hallucination and reality, and Neets, I saw the guy from my dream, the one that I told you about. He was at the parade and... and he was here my room. Persian guy? Leather jacket? - Did I tell you that? - No. You were taking pictures before you fainted. I got your phone here. Cameras don't hallucinate, and that guy is staring right at you. - We gotta go. We gotta go now. - I'm gonna get you outta here, Nomi. I love you. I love you, too. Hey, excuse me? I'm just having some trouble sleeping. What kind of sleeping pills you guys sell? Somulex. That's my drug, bro. With a shot of bourbon, totally knocks me out. Bam! But don't tell anyone I told you that, 'cause like, you're not supposed to take liquor with it. But I totally dig the buzz. And it gives me major fucked up dreams. Fucked up dreams I got plenty of. Sure. We used to do these training courses, and they taught us that drugs are like shoes. Everyone needs them, but they don't always fit. - Hm. - Second aisle to the left. Hello. My name is Jonas. I know who you are. You know what they told you, and you know what your senses are telling you. The question is, Will, which of the two are you going to trust? How do you know my name? - She told me. - Who? Angelica, the woman that gave birth to you, just before she took her life. She shot herself. We all experience many births and deaths during a life... but few know what it means to be reborn a sensate. - A what? - You have a migraine. You've had it since you saw her. It will last for several more days. When mine finally ended, I cried like a baby, but that's just the beginning. You will start to feel strange things. You will feel snow in the middle of the summer, rain when there isn't a cloud in the sky. You'll feel anger and joy and pain. Pleasure without any reason. Excuse me. Excuse me. Do you see this guy? I don't have much time, Will. There's a plane leaving in an hour and I have to be on it. No, you're not going anywhere. There is a girl in San Francisco, Nomi Marks. She needs your help, just like Sara Patrell needed your help. I'm still a cop. I can't let you go. I'm not the enemy, Will. Quite a few governments including this one says you are. You're about to go for the gun strapped to your ankle, but by the time you do, the fight will be over. Not cool, man. Should I call the cops? I am a cop. - Don't do this, Will. - What the fuck?! You've spent your life trying to understand what happened to you. If you don't let me go, you might never find out. - Oh, my God, I'm losing my mind. - No, it's just expanding. Well done. Yes, the connection flows both ways, which raises the question: If you're here, who's driving back there? Sync and corrected by Elderfel www.addic7ed.com
