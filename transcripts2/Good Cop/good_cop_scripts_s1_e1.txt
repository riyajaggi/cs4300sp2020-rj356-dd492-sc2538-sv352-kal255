I'm eating. Make sure you chew it. 28 times. Very good. Be back in a minute, Tom. All right, Amy. Are you following me? This is the ladies'. Yeah, I know. I like it in here. Doesn't stink of piss. I'll come back. No, no... no need for that. You do what you've got to do. Don't mind me, go on. No, I'll wait. No, no, don't wait. Or I'll feel bad. Go on. Are you all right in there, Amy?

Do you want me to check out your pockets? Is that what you want me to do? You know, the next copper I see on his own... I'm going to hammer him! Have a nice day, sir. Miss, it's OK. I'm a police officer. Remember Cassie, Gaz? Yeah, of course I remember Cassie. She's back. Saw her this morning. Planned? No. I was on the beach, running. How did it go? She said hello. It was awkward, but... you know. Polite. Yeah. It's a big deal though, innit? Seeing her again. Yeah, it was a bit. She had the baby with her. A little girl. Libby. Liberty. How did that feel? Don't know. Different. Weird. She couldn't get away quick enough, Cassie. Did you ever tell your dad? No. Couldn't. Guys. Andy. Got a screen full of e-mails from CPS, all barking orders. Or requesting support. Hey, have you seen the new WPC? Amanda. Ah, is that her name? Yeah, she's all there, man. Good weekend, Gaz? So-so. Next door had a barbecue. Oh, rock'n'roll. Was it pissing down? Kids enjoy it, Gaz? Yeah, they loved it. Food, music, trampoline, vomit - what's not to enjoy? See you in there, lads. I think I'm in lust. With Amanda. Thank you. All right? I'm Andy. Amanda. Oh... Amanda's my mother's name. Only... we all call her Mum. Don't. What? Flirt, please. No offence. Oh, yeah. None taken. Afternoon, boys and girls. Afternoon, sarge. Can we settle down and sit down, please? The sooner we get started, the sooner we can get started. Lesbian, are you? ..We've got a lot to get through. I assuming you've got the DO736 forms...? Me too. A lesbo trapped inside this alpha-male body. Can I watch? Police Constable Stockwell? Yes, Sergeant? Look at me, and keep looking at me. Sergeant. Stockwell, Sav. Call sign Alpha 21, city centre and to the south. Check your list of outstanding carefully. It's on the long side, so prioritise. She knew I was joking, didn't she? No idea, mate. You'll have to mention I'm a very "PC" PC. 'Alpha 21, over.' Alpha 21. That you, Debs? Tell her we're not out of the car park yet! 'Domestic disturbance, Sav. No.35, Mariners' Quay.' 35 Mariners' Quay. Roger that. Right. Ready to do some good? Can't wait. What was the name again, Bays? Bays. Yeah. Chocolate biscuit? Mr Bays...? Mrs Bays, could you open the door, please? Police. I hate domestics. Who is it? It's the police. Could you open the door, please? If you look outside your front window you'll see a police car. That's what we arrived in. Mrs Bays...? Mrs Bays, neighbours reported shouting, screaming. You've left your shopping outside. Are you alone? Upstairs. Who? David. David? Can you tell me what happened? Nothing. I didn't do anything. Nothing. What happened to your nose, mate? It started bleeding, like it always does. For no reason? Yeah. You're sure nothing happened? Sav? Baby's dead. A tiny baby. Oh, Christ, you are jokin'? Foul play? No, I don't know. It's tiny. You're sure it's dead? Right. I'll call it in. Paramedic, CID? Better had. Shit! Lima One, Lima One. This is Alpha 21. Receiving, over? Yes, requesting CID and ambulance to 35 Mariners' Key. Can you update me with the ETA... Sarge, from Alpha 21. Did you get my last transmission regarding the situation at 35 Mariners' Key? Over. Your brother, right? What's his name? Stan. Stanley. David, I need you to pass Stanley over to me, and I need you to go downstairs to your mum. Can you do that, please? She's saying it's my fault. I didn't do anything. OK. I need to start sorting things out. I'll take Stanley, please? I'll hold him really carefully, just like you're doing. OK? I'll be really gentle with him. That's it. Good man. Good man... Good lad, that's it. The blood on the blanket - is that yours? Yeah. What are you doing? I think it's best if we wait downstairs. I know who you're calling. I don't need a paramedic to tell me what's happened. I know what's happened. It wasn't my fault. I told you to stop saying that. Well, it wasn't! So you keep telling me again and again and again! Mrs Bays, I think it's best if we go downstairs, OK? I know what you're doing. You'll be all right, mate. You'll be looked after, OK? Go with Andy. I'm sorry, Mrs Bays, but I have to ask you these questions. All right? What time did you go out...? PC Rocksavage? Yeah. Night CID. You found the body, I believe? The baby, yeah. How did it look, the scene? The lad was just holding him, gently. Did he say anything? Only that nothing had happened. I wouldn't call it nothing, would you? Is he all there? The kid? How do you mean? Is he normal? Or not? He's normal. Anything unusual seen or said? The whole thing was unusual. Are you going to write this up? Yeah. Gut feeling? Heartbreak. Tragedy. Fingers crossed. Nice one. Sir. 'Hello?' Hello, Joanne? It's John Paul. Rocksavage. Joanne? 'What do you want?' I bumped into Cassie. Is she staying with you? 'That's none of your business. 'My daughter and my grand-daughter are none of your business.' I was hoping you'd pass on my number. Will you tell her I called? 'What do you think? Dickhead.' HANGS UP Thanks Jo, always a pleasure. Right, we're done. We're free to go. There you are. What's this? Sugar boost. What? Don't you want it? You are unbelievable. It's a chocolate biscuit. In the scheme of things I don't think it matters, do you? Did you tell the FLO to keep us in the loop? Yeah. What, you think the kid did something? Hope not. Are you all right? Yeah. I will be. Do you want to open that for me? Say please. Do you want me to feed you? No, I'm all right. You sure? Two teas, Jed. Just the teas. How are you? Actually, no, I tell a lie, two bacon sarnies as well. No butter on them. Only me, Dad. How are you, bud? 'Worn out with doing cartwheels.' Has Justine left? Justine's still here, I'm running late. 'Oh, hiya.' 'How is he? How's he been?' 'Yeah, quite bright. He's eaten, he's comfortable and he's reading.' I'll leave you to him. 'Roger that.' You all right. lad? 'Yeah, all right. What are you reading?' 'Stevenson.' Treasure Island again? It's the sea air, makes me feel good. You been busy? 'Always busy.' Just making time for a cup of tea. Anything good happened? 'Routine.' Hopefully it'll be a quiet night. Anyway, Dad, just a flying visit. I'll leave you to your book, shall I? 'You take care out there.' Always. 'See you later, Pop.' Are you OK? 'Alpha 21 over. 'Disturbance at number 17, Hadley Road.' I want you. Get in bed with me. Ssh. Have arrived at number 17, Hadley Road. 'Received that, Sav.' Aw, they want to play. Front or back? Er... I'm happy where I am. Come on, folks, open up. Come on, open up. Police. Hello? Open up! Hello? Police. Hello. Hello? You all right there, mate? Are you? Er... Do you want to drop that bat? Don't think so. Get up! Get up! Bang! What you doing? Get off him, leave him alone. Get out! Out! You animals! Get off him! Go, go, go, go. Get out! Get up, pig! Start crawling or get up! Sav. Sav... Come on, little piggy, little piggy. You keep knocking, but you can't get in. Andy! Andy! Andy! Move, you pigs. Go on! Go! Go! Andy! Lima 1. This is Alpha 21. Ambulance needed to Hadley Road. Officer attacked and hurt, need it quickly! How's he doing? Not good. He's gone for a scan. Head, body. They kicked the shit out of him. Have we got a name? Whose house was it? House was rented. Where were you when it happened? I mean, what did you see? Are you up to going through it? Who made the call? The 999? It was a woman, a neighbour. Genuine? Why? Andy went in through the front door and they were waiting for him. They locked him in and locked me out. A set-up? The call was genuine. We've got a name, address and phone number. I asked him what he wanted, front or back. Heads or tails, that's it. His stuff's all over the house, the floor. His baton, his radio. We'll get it back. I'll get it back. No, we'll get it back. You get yourself home. Are you up to that? Yeah. You don't want a ride? He ripped his number off. We'll talk properly tomorrow... and you WILL talk. Your cot-death was exactly that, by the way - a cot-death. Post-mortem confirmed it. Good. I suppose. Hiya. I was one of the first coppers, I came to your house. Yeah. Mind if I...? I haven't said how sorry I am... for you and David. Where is he? Bathroom. David? Are you in there, David? David? Yeah. Planning on coming out soon? Your mum's outside. She's getting worried about you. She's not me mum. She's someone who me dad shags. Do you see your mum? No. OK, so she's not your mum, but she is worried about you, and she cares about you. You've both been through a lot, you're both going through a lot. I might be wrong... but I think you need each other. She is worried about you. I heard you the first time. Shall we go and see her, eh? I was good at making him laugh. Stan? Yeah. I didn't do nothing. I know. She really needs you, David. Hey, Dad. Awake, are you? You're early. Yeah. Andy took a bit of a pounding, he's in a pretty bad way. Hospital. I'm fine. Are you sure? Yeah. The good guys came second, but I'm fine. Want me to read a bit? Ah, later. Tea? Toast? Later, thanks. You know, the trouble with you being a copper is you get to see too much shite. I know. Life's good. People are good. It was a bad day, that's all, Dad. Well, more than a bad day. Bad day doesn't quite cover it. What do you want? I think you're nicked. Don't you? No. On the floor. I'll tell you what's going to happen here. Either you're going to grow a pair of balls and shoot me... which you won't... or I'm going to take that gun, shove it up your arse and pull the trigger. Cos I can't let you go. I don't want to let you go. What's it to be, kid? Cos I am not in the fucking mood for this. You haven't got the balls! On the floor, now. No. I'm not sure if I've fucked up, mate. I'm not sorry. I'm not sorry he's gone. The opposite. It's all sorted. He won't be mouthin' off about kickin' a copper. Sorry? Sorry, I thought you said something. No. Just talking to Andy. Can he hear me, do you think? You know, I've no idea. They say familiar voices and sounds can help. There's certainly no harm in it, everyone does it. No-one can tell me he didn't deserve it. He deserved it. He deserved it, didn't he? Constable Rocksavage? Yeah. DC Frainey? Liam. Sav. What time does your shift start? Two. If they'll have me. Head wrecked? Hope not. Jump in. Any idea why he might have been shot? Execution or...? Not sure, not yet. One round was fired and it did the job. If it's a gang shooting, they usually go mad, you know, make sure. The poor SOCO shit himself. Turns up to take a few prints and ends up tripping over a body. Should really have been a bobby on the door all night. No-one available. Have we got an ID on the body? His name's Noel Finch. Have you heard of him? No, can't say I have. Meat-head, apparently. He runs the doors for a company called Palomino Security. I've heard of them. How's your mate? Not good. Critical care. Sedated. Bastards. Who's in charge of the investigation? DCI Costello. He's good, but he knows it. It's good for me, though. At least I'm working with someone who knows what they're doing. The body's upstairs in the bedroom. Stairs are to the right as we go in. Keep to the covered areas, yeah? You're sure you're all right to view the body? We could use a photograph, if you want? No, I'm fine. Seen him before? Yeah. Are you OK? Yeah. I've seen him twice. Once in a restaurant yesterday afternoon and once here last night. What restaurant was that? The All American Diner. Yesterday lunchtime. Him and his mates were blitzed and making a nuisance of themselves. You spoke to them? I asked them to leave, which they did. I'll write it up. So, er, whereabout in the house are we going to find your prints? Outside, front and back. Inside, the kitchen, hallway and lounge. You didn't come up here at all, no? No. Oh, actually. I was waiting for the ambulance, I thought was going to be sick. I wasn't, but I came up looking for the bathroom. OK. Thanks. Does the footprint belong to the killer? Well, to someone who was here after the shot was fired. Any idea who? Yeah. OK, that's it, you can go. Have you got your bobby quota, for door-to-door? If you're thinking of volunteering, that's not a good idea. That might cause me a problem in court. Why's that? I don't know, but a barrister might. Thank you. Get back here as soon as you can. Your Sarge mentioned an epaulette... your mate's number. Yeah. Why, have you found it? Not that I'm aware... but if we do, I'll get it back to you. Nice one. Kyle Smart. Smart by name, thick by nature. Was released from prison just nine days ago and already we've got a spike in thefts from vehicles. Alpha 21, he likes working your area, keep an eye out. If you see him, even if he's walking the dog, stop him, warn him. Next is a missing persons. David Fenner, 13 years of age, walked out of his home early hours of this morning, not been seen, not made any contact since. Mariners Quay David Fenner, brother of the cot death? That's him. So he's going to be distressed, to say the least. What about his father? David doesn't know where he is. I don't know where he is. Can I look in his room? If you want. Well, was it useful? What were you hoping to find? I've no idea. I only asked. No, you didn't only ask. You questioned. And take the chip off your shoulder. I haven't got a chip on my shoulder. You've got your nose in the air. Andy tried to talk to you and you shot him down. I've no idea what I was looking for. I was just hoping to find something. He's going on a train, going somewhere, anywhere but home. BMW X5, registration Yankee Papa Zero Five, Hotel Zulu Zulu. Over. Anything? CD, Sat nav's still there. Not a very successful robbery. He saw us, we disturbed him. Check under the car. Take a look under the car. See anything? White male, aged 17 to 21. Amanda, meet Kyle Smart. Kyle, this is Amanda. All right. You know what, Kyle. There's 101 better things I could be doing. There's a 101 better things YOU could be doing. Then let me go. But what we all have to do is waste our time taking you backwards and forwards to the cell. I don't know why you don't just stop. It's not as if you're any good at it. If I'm wasting your time, let me go. I'm just trying to make a living. Then get a job. It's people like me who are keeping you in a job. Where's Andy? Hospital. He took a beating. Bad? Yeah. I'm sorry to hear that. Is the new girl fast-track, Sav? She's clever, if that's what you mean. Ambitious. Determined. Nice tits. Hey, we'll have none of that, thank you. It was a compliment. Am I your first, Amanda? Arrest. No. If I swear on me Ma's life to change, will you go out with me? No. Why not? Crime prevention. One for you, when you're ready, John. Liam. Sav. Do you like what you see, then? Have you got a problem? Mr Rose, shut your mouth. What, so I can't I speak? Or is that against the law as well? As well as what? Kickin' the shit out of a copper? Sav, don't. What copper was that? Did I enjoy it? Watch yourself, shit-for-brains. Whoa. Slander and a threat. This might be my lucky night. Mr Rose. He started it. 'Alpha 21, report location. 'Need to see you, Sav. 'Sav?' "He lay as we had left him, on his back, "with his eyes open and one arm stretched out. "'Draw down the blind, Jim,' whispered my mother, "they might come and watch outside. "'And now,' said she, when I had done so, "'We have to get the key off that "'and who's to touch it, I should like to know!' "And she gave a kind of sob as she said the words. "I went down on my knees at once. "On the floor, close to his hand, "there was a little round of paper, "blackened on the one side. "I could not doubt that this was the Black Spot." The curse. Have you had enough? Enough for tonight. Are you OK? I want my life back. Do you? He's admitted to finding Finch, dead. He found him dead when? Minutes after he was shot.
