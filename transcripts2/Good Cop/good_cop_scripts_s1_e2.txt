 I don't know. I'm just going to talk. Afternoon. I'm, erm... I'm not much good with heights. I won't be coming any closer. Do you know what today is? My birthday. Guess how old? How's about us calling someone, eh? Or you can do it yourself, borrow my phone. Is there someone you'd like to talk to? Someone you want to shout at? Stop! Stop there. Don't come near me. OK, I've stopped. I've stopped. I'll do exactly what you want, believe me. I'm just trying to help, that's all. We both are. This is Amanda. No! Don't. NO! Bastard! Sav? Sav! Sarge? Amanda's got a question for you. Is there a procedure for suicides? Or guidelines for what to say, what not to say. You think I messed up? No. Sounds like. I'm asking a question. Really? Can I go now? I'm asking a question. Aren't I allowed to do that? Amanda, we are the very last bastion of common sense. Write a procedure - all people do is hit you with it. Did he do anything wrong? No, of course not. I never said he did. It's just... so much is expected of us. Correct. She had sweets in her pocket. I kept thinking who were they for? You know, I wanted to save her, and I thought we could save her. There's nothing I can say except you did your best. I'd like to give you a hug, but there actually is a procedure that tells me not to. Thank you. I was just asking a question, I wasn't getting at you. Fine. You know, it just got to me, that's all. It's fine. PHONE RINGS PC Rocksavage. 'Is that PC Rocksavage, is it?' Yeah. 'I'm about to spoil your day, PC Rocksavage. 'Did you think you'd get away with it? 'I'll be in touch, you murdering bastard.' Can I help you, Sav? Liam. Yeah, just seeing how's it going? Any news? Nothing new. We're not...at a dead end, we're just developing what we've got. What about Callum Rose? Police bail. No charge? Oh, there will be. He was there at the restaurant and at the house, kicking the shit out of Andy. If that's what you saw, Sav, put it in writing. You're the witness. Costello may not like a revised statement, but if that's who you saw... He's admitted to finding Finch dead. You're joking? Oh, no. Well, he had blood on his shoes and the footwell of his car. He had to admit to something. He found him dead when? Must have been minutes after he was shot. He was waiting for him at the end of the road. He dropped him off and...was waiting. In a car? White Beemer. Did he see anyone? He must have. Unless he's lying. He went, "No comment." Unless he did it, shot Finch. It's possible, but, nah, we don't think so. There's more to come. He knows more than he's saying. He's just...working out what's best for him. See you, Sav. HE RETCHES Everything all right, Sav? You don't look too good, mate. Just needed to get out for some fresh air. Yeah, me too. Down to seven a day now. Very good. When's Andy's funeral, Sav, do we know yet? No. Depends when they release him. Spoken to his family? I've left a message, sent a card. Coping OK yourself? Yeah, just getting on with it. Well, if you want to talk, I'm around, yeah? Cheers, Gaz. 'Good work-out?' Yeah. Enjoyed it. I should be doing this. You're tired. Tonight, you don't have to. I'm worried about you. There's nothing to be worried about. Murder and a suicide, no? I'm on a roll. I think that's you done. I'd kiss ya. You know, anybody who takes their own life, in my book, is a coward. All they're doing is passing on the pain, a little bit to you, a little bit to the family. Family don't know yet. We haven't got a name. What we reading? Don't you dare go feeling guilty is what I'm saying. I won't. I don't. You should spend five minutes in a church, I mean it. For the quiet. It's no good looking after your body and forgetting about your soul. Me soul's fine. You should look after your whole self. I do look after me whole self. Bollocks! Them included. Dad, I'm fine. Maybe she's a secret agent, your suicide. Could be. You think? Hmm. A double agent maybe. The pressure got to her. I take it we're reading Bond. Casino Royale. Exshellent. Gaz, you know I mentioned Cassie was back? Yeah. What do I do? Depends what you want. A conversation. Leading to what? I don't know. Then you should think about it. It's a big deal. It's not just you and Cassie, is it? It's the little girl. And she don't know you from Adam. She's never laid eyes on you. I want to put things right. Meaning what? Thanks, mate, you've been a great help. No, no. Do you want this little girl in your life, Sav? Forever? Do you want that? I mean, can you do that? Emotionally, financially, logistically? Is that what you really want? Or were you thinking more along the lines of a quick shag with her mum? What do you want, Sav? What can you give? That's all I'm saying. You're welcome. Question - are you OK with Amanda? Yeah. I think so. Is she OK with me? She's probationary. She doesn't have a say in the matter. Are you OK with her being in the passenger seat? Yeah. She's good. I like her. Sure? Yeah. Nice one. Where is Amanda? Not seen her today. She's good, thanks, if you mean Police Constable Morgan. She's learning how to drive a police car. Why, are you interested? I'll put a word in for you, if you like. I can speak for myself, mate. Eloquently. I'll tell her you'll take her for a nice protein shake, eh? PHONE RINGS PC Rocksavage. 'Hello, PC Rocksavage. It's me again. 'I just wanted to say how sorry I was to hear about your partner, 'you know, your little buddy.' And you are? 'He didn't deserve the kickin' that he took, no way.' But, then again, my mate didn't deserve the bullet that he took. Enjoy it, did you? Who is it I'm talking to? 'I thought you might want to buy me a coffee.' Why would I want to do that? I don't know. I thought you might want to be my bitch. Hm? I notice you haven't hung up yet. Still waiting for a punchline, or a name. 'You know my name.' What was all that about? Nothing. A wannabe informer wanted paying, but didn't want to give his name. Sav, picture of your jumper. Cheers, Gaz. Was it really your birthday yesterday? No. It was a ploy. Do you resent me being here? Sitting here, in place of Andy? What kind of question's that? It's not a trick one. Well, you're not sitting there in place of Andy, are you? Andy's gone. Have I acted like I resent you? No. Then why ask? Just making conversation. I'm the friendly type. You can't go in there yet. It's not allowed. West Street Hostel. Can I help you? Yeah, police, to see Kevin, please. He's just along the corridor. Thank you. Over here, Sav. They got you hoovering, have they? I do anything and everything. It beats paperwork. Who's this? Amanda Morgan. Kevin Duncan, house manager, Sagittarius. We were hoping you might be able to tell us who this is. What's she done? Suicide. Jumped off a roof. Usually want privacy. INTERCOM RINGS Margie, who's that? Who do you think? He's back. Problem? A client. I'll deal with it. Can't we get the police to deal with it? He's a bloody nuisance. We do not open the doors until 6pm. I'm cold, aren't I? Just open the door. 6pm. 6pm. No exceptions. That's the rule. Staff arrive half five, we open the doors at six. Just open the fucking door! All I want is my bed, that's all. Last chance, Alistair. You're on your very last chance, hear me? Three strikes and that's it. You're two down with one to go. LAST CHANCE! 6PM. SIX. Thank you. What's his juice, drink or drugs? Drink definitely, drugs maybe. What can you do? And no, I've not seen your lady. Recognise her, Marg? No. No, sorry. GLASS SHATTERS This is Alpha two-one, incident at the West Street Hostel... BRAKES SCREECH God, you've hit him! Come here, you little junkie prick! What the fuck do you think...? Argh! Amanda, call an ambulance! Amanda, he's got a knife! Lima one, Lima one, this is Alpha two-one. Ambulance and support requested urgently to a stabbing on Leeds Road, That's Leeds Road. What's his name? What's his name? Thomas. Thomas? Thomas, I want you to keep still, OK? Don't fight me. An ambulance is on its way, but you need to keep still. Keep your hands behind your back and do not struggle! Give me a cloth, a rag, something! Gimme your scarf! Quickly! Thomas, I need to put the pressure on the wound, OK? We need to stop the bleeding. Don't fight me! That's it, don't fight! That's it. Good man. No, no, no, don't fight me. That's it, stay calm. Amanda. Yeah? If I've been off with you, it's not been intentional. OK. I understand. You did well. So did you. You saved his life. Hope so. Yeah. Hi, John Paul. He's asleep. Oh, hiya. Is he OK? Yeah, he's fine. He had a bit of tantrum. Think it's wiped him out. Justine, don't say tantrum. Sorry. He just became a little bit frustrated, that's all. But he's OK now, frustration aside? Yeah, he's good. He's actually been feeling very good. He wants to do more and didn't want to take his painkillers. But he did? Yes. And he's fine. OK. Good. If all goes to plan, I finish at 11. Does that work for you? Yeah. It's not too late? No. OK. That's it. Spock out. Police. If you take your wedding ring off, does it make it all right? Like you're not cheating? It helps. With what? You're on to a good thing here, John Paul. I wouldn't rock the boat, if I were you. I'm interested. You take your rings off, but leave your watch on. I like to time you. You're getting better. I don't know you at all, do I? You've seen my references. I'm a good nurse... ..and I'm all woman. Make the bed. PHONE RINGS Hello? 'You've had long enough.' 'I'm outside.' Listen. Whoa, listen, listen. Just a quick chat. Just a quick chat, and then you can get back to your guilty pleasures, and, you know, everything's happy days, innit? What do you want? What's going on? Did you get my note? I was going to do it all, you know, all creepy, and cut out words from magazines, newspapers and shit, but... Nah, I couldn't be arsed. Am I being made here, is that it? Why didn't you dial 999 when you shot him? It give you a buzz, did it? Is there a point to all this? If there is I wish you'd make it. What do you think's a fair price to put on your life? Your career? Taking into account that you're just... You're just a murdering bastard copper, that's all. I've got to go now. I'd advise you to do the same. What are you going to do? Are you going to kill me, too? 100K. That should be doable, shouldn't it? I mean, you might take a second mortgage, might have to flog your car, I don't know, but III don't think that's being unreasonable, do you? I genuinely don't know what you're on about. Do you think about being locked up? Do you think about being a copper, locked up? 100K. And if I'm feeling generous, you might get your life back. And me - I get to go to France, Spain... ..Wales. I like Wales. HE CHUCKLES This is it, this is the bit, and it's on page 007. "Satisfied that his room had not been searched while he was at the casino, "Bond undressed and took a cold shower. "Then he lit his 70th cigarette of the day..." 70th! Seven, 'oh'. Seven, zero cigarettes, full strength. Well, he's been playing cards all day. 70 cigs a day? He'd never be able to manage the stairs. No wonder he gets captured and tortured. Now you're giving the end away. When was it written, '51, '52? Erm, 1952. Dad, there's already sugar in it. Cigarettes were good for you in those days. Anyway, it doesn't lessen the character anything. Times change. The motives of heroes and villains don't. Books tell you that. Shakespeare tells you that. What about the motives of a good man that does bad things? Who are we taking about? Bond. Bad dreams last night? Don't know. You called out. What did I say? You just called out. Cassie. Hey. You look nice. I thought if I gave you a lift to work, we might have time for a coffee. A croissant? Why? What do you want? No idea. No idea where to start, what to say, what I want. I just know I'd like to talk to you. I'm not going in the car. There's a cafe on the corner of Dale Street and Old Hall Street in town. I'll meet you there in half an hour. I could give you a lift. No, thanks. Why not? Because I want to be able to walk away. I'm only doing this so that...get it over with. What can I get you? Nothing, thank you. You sure? Where is it you're working? Not far. What you doing? Realtor, estate agent. Business properties. The last time we sat opposite each other, it wasn't exactly my finest hour. No. But it worked out for the best. Think so? In the end. I got to see the real you. I hope to God that wasn't the real me. Can I remind you how it went word for word? You don't have to. I know how it went. Me, "I'm pregnant." Cassie, don't. You, "Is it mine?" Please. Me, "Do you want it to be yours?" You... "Not especially." I know what I said. I haven't forgotten what I said. I was wrong. I was a knob. You were a disgrace, John Paul. We'd known each other for seven weeks. We spent every day together for seven weeks. Why was that? Biggest mistake I ever made was what I did to you. Biggest regret is letting you get up and walk away. I am so, so sorry. Maybe you are a different person but...I didn't know you then and I don't know you now. Get to know me. I have a life and I like it. I don't...NEED you in it. What about Libby? Have you ever thought I might be good for her? Don't say her name like you know her. I could help you. She's happy how she is and so am I. TUTTING Do you know what? I'm getting really good at sneaking round. I know where you live. I know where your bird lives. I know where you work. I know where you shag her. HE LAUGHS You know, I might start doing this for a living actually. Yeah. 20,000. That's all I can do. Ten I've got saved and I can borrow another ten. That's all I can do. Looks like it's Wales. Yeah. You still got the gun? No. Well, that's a shame. You're right. I want my life back. Do you? Well, I think... ..it's worth a whole lot more than 20 grand's worth. 35. That is the best I can do. Ten I've got. You can have that now, today. What about the rest? A couple of weeks. A week. OK. Good. I'll call you. Sir. Constable Rocksavage. Erm, your mate's epaulette, Constable Stockwell's epaulette, his number... You said that Finch put it in his pocket? Yeah. Like a trophy? Yeah, that's right. Well, it's odd cos there's no sign of it on the body or in the grounds of the house, It's a pity. He must have thrown his trophy away. Must have. Shame. I would have liked to have recovered it. So... HE SNIGGERS ..how come you let the new girl chase down the villain, Sav? She's keen. You'll be getting yourself a reputation, mate. What's that supposed to mean? Sav, it was a joke. No, I'm asking Phil The Beef, here. What's that supposed to mean? Are you talking about Andy now? Well, I wasn't, but now you come to mention it. It was a joke, Sav. Take a step backwards. He's trying to wind you up, that's all. Hit a nerve, did I? You're an arsehole, do you know that? Did I hit a nerve, Sav? Enough of the name-calling, the pair of you! Where are we, the playground!? He started it! Listen to yourself. Enough! Go on! Go on, out! You know what he's like. He's a blunt instrument, and he WAS only joking. Maybe you shouldn't be here. I'm fine. "PCs Rocksavage and Morgan clearly witnessed the suspect named above "attack the victim named above with a sharp blade. "The suspect attempted to run away, but was twatted by a car." Phil, what's another word for twatted? In what context? "..but was twatted by a car." Was involved in a collision with a vehicle. Obviously. All right? Thanks. What do you want? I'm not talking to you, so get out of my cell. I'm not here to take a statement, I'm not here to talk about last night. Just wondering if you've ever come across this woman. I don't know her. You haven't looked. I don't know her. It might help if you looked. She's dead, jumped off a tall building. So? Couldn't care less. We think she was homeless. Sure you've not come across her? We'd like to inform her family. Of what? Inform them of what? Her death. You're joking, aren't ya? They're glad she's gone. They've forgotten all about her. And when no-one remembers you, it's like you were never here in the first place. So get out of my cell, pig. What happens if she isn't claimed? She belongs to the coroner, kept in storage until she is claimed. She might be there for years. 'Are you up to making a statement?' The nurse told us you were talking normally. A statement? Yeah. Why? What's the point? To hear your side of the story. To help with the prosecution. HE LAUGHS What's funny? You are. You don't want to tell us what happened? You were there. You were nearer. I can't remember. It's all a blur. I think you can remember. I couldn't care less what you think. How old are you? PC Morgan chased down and caught the guy who attacked you. Well, PC Morgan shouldn't have bothered her bony arse. No offence. Really? What's the point in wasting more taxpayers' money? I just want a name. So you can tell whoever it is, live by the sword, die by the sword. Are you telling us that you believe in violence? I'm not telling you anything. Give him a good hiding, that's what I say. I know it'd give me more satisfaction. All I need is his name. Dad. Dad, you're going to give yourself a heart attack. Go away. OK, I'm going. And don't you dare tidy up! It's your mess. And I'll clear it! John Paul. John Paul? I think I need to get out a bit more. Tidy your room and I'll think about it. He started it. "Jesus said to him, 'Put your sword in its place, " 'For all that take the sword, perish by the sword.' " Night, Dad. Love you. PHONE RINGS Hello. It must be you. Shall we meet? I don't know. I don't know, is it worth my while, or what? Yeah. Where are you now? Where am I? I'm heading home. Why? Let's meet there in an hour. 'No. No, no, no. Let's not. 'I don't think so. 'Listen, I tell you what. 'I'll meet you dinnertime tomorrow' in John Lewis, menswear... HE CHUCKLES '..cos I need a pair of socks anyway.' So... ..it's your call, man. Yes or no? Yeah. All right. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. And when I say dinner, I mean lunch, not tea. All right? 12 o'clock. HE GRUNTS AND GROANS Callum... ..I need to be sure you've told no-one else. Do you know what that means? Do you know what I have to do? This can't be avoided. Argh! ' "My dear boy," Le Chiffre spoke like a father, ' "the game of Red Indians is over, quite over. ' "You have stumbled by mischance into a game for grown-ups." ' "Bond closed his eyes and waited for the pain.' "He knew that the beginning of torture is the worst." "There is a parabola of agony, "a crescendo leading up to a peak and then the nerves are blunted "and react progressively less, until unconsciousness and death. "All he could do was to pray for the peak, "pray that his spirit would hold out so long, "and then accept the long free wheel down to the final blackout." HE SCREAMS I haven't told anyone, I swear to God. HE SOBS I won't tell anyone. I swear to God. HE WHIMPERS I won't tell anyone. Please. No more, no more of this, please. I swear to God. OK. No. No, no, no, no, no, no. Don't... No, no, no, no. PLAYS MUSIC LOUD GUNSHOT No, we are not linking the two murders, not yet. ? Do you realise... ? Trainers, yeah. He was wearing trainers with white edges to the soles. And do you remember seeing anything in the street, anyone? I practically bumped into some guy. ? ..that you have the most beautiful face ? Do you realise? ? 'He was there. He's part of that crew. I know what I saw.' I'm talking now! ? We're floating in space ? Do you realise... ? 'I want to rewind. 'I want to start again. 'I want that day to start again.' ?.. that happiness makes you cry? ? Do you realise... 'Where are you going? 'Out for a walk.' At this time of night, again? ? ..that everyone you know ? Some day, will die? ? Subtitles by Red Bee Media Ltd
