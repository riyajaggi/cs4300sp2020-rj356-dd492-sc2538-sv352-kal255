 Good Cop (2012): Season 1, Episode 3 - Episode #1.3 - full transcript 
 Investigating Rose's murder Sav is relieved to find that the only witness to his escape cannot identify him. He becomes involved in a domestic dispute,empathising with husband Brendan,who is also denied access to his child,but Brendan is also a possible witness and Sav,whilst helping Brendan, is keen to establish that he saw nothing. Jonjo Heinz,another of Finch's gang,comes to the police station to admit that he knew the two dead men but denies being one of Andy's attackers,which Sav knows to be untrue. Breaking into Heinz's house Sav sees he is ready to flee and takes his passport but DCI Costello is intrigued by Sav's unnatural persistence in wanting to nail Heinz. Having taken photos of Cassie and their child Sav is confronted by Cassie who wants the photos back. He posts them to her and looking at them seems to strike a chord with her about herself and Sav.

 Andy! Get up, pig! We kicked the shit out of him. You haven't got the balls. He's admitted to finding Finch dead. Did he see anyone? He went, "No comment". I'll be in touch. 'You murdering bastard!' Cassie! You look nice. I have a life and I like it, I don't need you in it. I know where you live, I know where your bird lives. I'm worried about you. You think about being a copper locked up.

 I'm heading home, why? Let's meet there in an hour. Argh! I haven't told anyone. I swear to God! Subtitles by MemoryOnSmells http://UKsubtitles.ru. Andy Stockwell was more than a colleague, more than a friend, to me he was the perfect copper. Taking everything in his stride... everyone at face value. No sides, no agendas, no preconceptions. Remember, whatever notes you put on the back of the forms, you duplicate in your notebooks. A bit of attention, a bit of hush. OK. Callum Rose. Callum Rose. Callum Rose. Beaten. Shot dead. Executed. Take a good look. 36 years of age.

 Yes, he was known to us. Yes, he was an associate of Noel Finch, and therefore, yes, he may or may not have taken part in the murder of police constable Andy Stockwell. That doesn't mean we do nothing. Doesn't mean we sit here, rejoice and treat his murder like a non-event. We cannot... we do not tolerate gobshites who think that putting a bullet into somebody's head is in some way acceptable. What, even if that person's another gobshite, sir? That's right, Mr Davenport, at best that would be unprofessional, would it not? Correct, sir. Right, your sergeant has given you the questionnaires, they are important, they must be completed, but they are NOT your bible. If you think an answer or a comment is worth pursuing, then pursue it. Any questions? Sir, you said Callum Rose was an associate of Noel Finch, who was also shot. No, we're not linking the two murders, not yet. Well, was it the same gun? No comment. Is that a yes? No. That's an I know but you don't need to. Anyone else? Good. Thank you. Be thorough, be professional. How come you never tell us to be professional, Sarge? Cos I know you're never anything but, Philip. Are you being facetious, Sarge? You tell me. Any joy with Cassandra? No, nothing. Nada. Write a letter. I mean it. Letters are kept. Sav, let's do our job, shall we? Who's Cassandra? That's a nice name. She's an ex, I suppose. A long time ago. Oh! Is she trying to play hard to get back? She's exercising her right to blank me. Sav? Ten seconds. It's brutal! It's getting a bit claustrophobic in here. How old are you, Mr Frazier? 46. A hard life. How tall are you? 5'8" in the winter. Why? It's elimination. Do you live alone? It's worse than that, I've got a cat somewhere. Do you like cats? I don't mind. Bastards they are, selfish. Can I make a cup of tea? No, we're fine. No, can I make myself a cup of tea? He didn't play much music, but when he did it was loud, kinda bass heavy, know what I mean? What time was this? I'd just got in from work, so it was just before one. I was going to bang on my floor, his ceiling, when it all went quiet. And then what? Well, nothing. I could lower the telly. What was he in to? You heard or saw nothing else? I heard the front door go, the front door to the building. Looked out the window and saw some guy walking away. Can you describe this guy? Dark clothing. That's it. How tall was he? I've no idea. Was he... taller than me? Smaller than me? I don't know. Taller. I've no idea. Was he white, black, Asian? He was wearing a hat, I can tell you that much. What kind of hat? A black, woolly-type hat. Well, he was white. I've just saw him, mind's eye. He was white. Anything else? What was his build? Normal. Medium. Average. Take your pick. Was he your killer? We don't know. Oh... trainers. Trainers, yeah. He was wearing... trainers with white edges to the soles. You've... not spoken to our detectives? No, no-one. Then, just tell them what you told us. If you can't describe this man, then don't even try, just say what you know. What you have given us is a time. Thank you. I'm trying to see his face, I can't. Then that's what you say. What we don't want is the wrong information. OK? Erm... our numbers... in case you remember anything else. Thanks very much for your time. Excuse me! Excuse me! I'm sorry but I think there's someone hiding in my shop. There's a room upstairs and I heard a noise. What's through there? Toilet, wash basin. Oh, my God! It only locks from the inside. Hello. Police. Would you like to come out? Hello! I really don't want to force the door, so could you open up, please? Oh, my God! What the bloody hell are you doing here?! I have to sleep somewhere. You know each other? I want him out. Whose name's on the lease? Who shags the hired help? I'll tell you both what's going to happen. Miss? Emma. If you'd like to go back downstairs with Constable Morgan. Sir, if you'd like to put your point of view to me. I want him out of here. Emma, don't say another word, it won't help. Just so long as you know, I want him out. She said not another word! Swivel! I'm not leaving. And I don't want to sound confrontational, but you can't make me. I'm going nowhere. OK. I'm John Paul. Bradley... Pearson. How long have you been staying here... above the shop? Three nights. You were here last night? Yeah. All night? All night. We're in this street making door-to-door enquiries. Some guy was shot just across the road. Sometime after ten. It wasn't me. Did you see anyone? Hear anything? No. Do you want to think about that? It's important. It's got nothing to do with me! And this has got nothing to do with you! This is my shop! I've got every right to be here! Still, I would like you to take a moment and think. Did you see anyone last night in that street? Anyone at all? I don't want to take a moment. With respect, I want you out of here! 'Sav?' Yeah? 'She's on the phone arranging to change the locks.' For God's sake, Emma! Don't you ever take a step back! Shouting and screaming isn't going to help. We'll talk to her. I'm sick of it! I'm sick of her! I'm sick of it! Bradley don't! What's going on? He took exception to changing the locks. Just... 30 minute break and no more, then we get on with our proper job. Why only 30, Sarge? I need to eat. Because we're busy and crime won't crack itself. No, no, no! No! No! No! 'Tomorrow will be mainly clear skies...' No! 'The outlook for the weekend is a little brighter, 'with temperatures...' Do you mind if I step inside, Bradley? How are you feeling? Is she happy now? Did she change the locks? I think so, yeah. Sorry about that. Regarding your arrest, you won't be charged. You'll be cautioned and released. I won't be cos there's nothing to charge me with. It WAS my bathroom. I'd like you to think a little bit harder about last night. Bradley, will you look at me, please? I saw nothing! You had fresh food and drink. You must have left the flat to buy it. Keep looking at me! What time did you leave the flat? What time last night? Between 12 and 1. Do you remember seeing anything in the street, anyone? I practically bumped into some guy. This is between 12 and 1, yeah? Yeah. Outside the shop. Our shop. Do you remember what this guy looked like? Can you remember anything about him at all? Keep looking at me! The only face I can see is you! Your face! You keep telling me to look at you! It's not helping? No, it's not helping! I'm tired! And for the record... I didn't shag the hired help. I kissed the hired help. Is that the same? Is it worse? And suddenly it's all over. If she won't listen, maybe you could write a letter. Letters are kept, re-read. I haven't seen my boy for ten days. Do you know how long ten days is in a kid's life? A long time. Keep thinking about that face. But not this face. What? What? I hope you're not upsetting my prisoner. Where did you find him? We didn't. He found us. He gave himself up. With his mates being shot, he seems genuinely scared. Yeah, but you are going to charge him? Sav, it's early days. He was there. Yes, and he's been formally arrested for it. On suspicion. Costello wants to hear what he's got to say, that's all. With a view to what? He can't deal. He hasn't said a word yet. Once you're finished, can I see the tapes? Costello's call, mate. Not mine. I've just given Bradley Pearson a cup of tea. He's still got nothing to say. Anyone else find a witness? Nothing. You going to write it up? Why me? Pearson spoke to you. You need the practice. Hey, I was saving that until last! It's all right, Amanda. You can share my biscuit if you want. We can start at both ends, work our way into the middle. Oh, Philly! You are gross! What? Can you state your name clearly, please? Jonathan Joseph Heinz. Can you identify the men in this picture, please? Yeah. Well, that's me. Cal Rose, Noel Finch... They're just two guys I met on the day. Nathan and Pally. After the diner, we went to two or three more bars. That was where I bailed, or just after. Where's home? That night, it was my girlfriend's house. 29 Keenan Avenue. I don't know. Watched telly, went to bed. Did you leave the house at all that night? No, I didn't. Did you at any time that night go to Noel Finch's rented accommodation on 17 Hadley Road? No. I. Did. Not. Look, I swear on my baby's life, I had nothing whatsoever to do with it. Let's talk about what happened before you went to the All-American Diner. Why were you there? Because I got a phone call from Cal. Do I fancy a beer? Him and Noel had been on it all day. Any reason why? A big payday. Cal told me he'd just earned 10K. Doing what? He said for carrying boxes out of a dead man's flat. Who was the dead man? Let's get one thing straight. I can tell you things. But it's all off the record, know what I'm saying? I'm not here to give evidence. I just want to get out of town and not be looking over my shoulder. So how did Finch and Rose earn the money? Who were they working for? Who was their contact? 'Alpha two to Sav. Five minutes. Where are you?' On my way. He's telling lies, by the way. Great big bastard lies. Just so you know. What's in it for me if I tell you? We're going round and round here, aren't we? How long has he been standing there? Do you know what MIT are doing? They're busy doing deals. They're having wet dreams about Noel Finch and Callum Rose having big-time connections. They've forgotten all about Andy. It's not true. It can't be true. I've just been listening to them. Talking to that bastard Heinz. 'Lima One to all units. Reported two men attacking 'an occupied car at the Queen's Dock Retail Park.' Thank God for that. Something to do. Lima One, Lima One, this is Alpha Two-One responding. Over. Get out the way! Alpha Two-One are coming through! Amanda, check on the driver. Excuse me, sir. You OK? Can you open the door for me, please? OK, OK! I stopped, I stopped! Hands behind your back. I'm not sorry. He deserved it. All of it! All of it! What does he need an ambulance for? We only hit his car. How long has he been seeing your daughter? She's a child, she's 14. Full of hormones. He's a grown hairy-arsed man with a nice shiny car. How long, do you know? Two months, as far as I know. Difficult question for you now, sir. Are they sleeping together? I don't know. Don't even want to think about it. Thank you, sir. What have we got? His name's Adam Reilly. He's 25 and he's in love with our assailant's daughter. She's 14. 'We're friends. We're not doing anything wrong.' Yasmin, would you call Adam your boyfriend? I call him Adam. Yasmin, don't! She asked! That's what I call him. Adam told me that he loves you. How do you feel about that? We care about each other. Yasmin, have you slept with Adam Reilly? Have you had sex with him? No, never. I'm not stupid! Has he ever bought you presents, Yasmin? Why? Why'd you want to know that? He's bought her clothes and a watch. And I bought him a T-shirt. It's what friends do. Maybe we're friends because he finds me interesting to talk to. I can hold a conversation. The police are involved because my dad tried to kill Adam with a baseball bat. Very clever! Maybe they're in love. It can happen. She's a child. She's not a child. OK, what if she was 13? Yeah, and what if she was 15? See? Never mind, "See?" She might look the part, but she isn't. If that was my daughter, I wouldn't like it. Getting broody? Broody? Not this wildcat. All right, Dad! Dad? Dad? In here. I've just been in here. Well, I haven't moved. I've been sat here reading Ralph Ellison. Invisible Man. Oh, very funny! Oh, you must have seen me. Very funny, Dad. New trainers? You've only just bought a pair. I know. Custody suite, Bridge. Sarge, it's Sav. Just a quick one. Has Bradley Pearson been released yet? An hour ago. Did he say anything, leave anything, a statement? Was he supposed to? No. It's just regarding this morning's door-to-doors. Whether he remembered something. Nothing. Is that it? Have you still got Jonjo Heinz? He's being fed and watered as we speak. Hope he chokes. Cheers, Sarge. What do you fancy, Dad? Anything in particular? Um... Not really. It's Mum's anniversary today. I forgot. Oh, that's all right. Not something we want to put in our diaries, is it? We can go if you want. No. We can go right now. And do what? Stare at a lump of granite? No. No, thank you. I dug these out. Photographs. Most of which I don't think you've seen, or if you have, it was a long time ago. They date from when me and your mam first met. Up until the week before the accident. The tin is what our wedding cake came in. Anyway, it's proof that she was here and not just a dream. I'll get something to eat later. Oh, this is me at full speed, by the way. You're not funny. Your mam used to think I was hilarious. It's the only reason she married me. Mam, meet Cassie. Cassie, this is me mam. You got your speech ready? Eulogy? Yeah. You can try it out on me, if you like. I've got a window. Do you mind if I don't? No, no. Not at all. It's about the man, is it? Heartfelt? Hope so. Good. No sign of a girlfriend, I suppose? Dad, can we talk about football? Taken any nice girls to the match recently? You're not getting any younger, you know. Sorry, sorry. That was your mother talking, not me. It sounded like you. She's got a sore throat. When was the last time I told you I was proud of you? Last week. You're late. You know, when this is all over... I want you to concentrate on yourself, do you hear me? Find some joy. Something to make you smile. I'm serious. I mean it. 'More than a colleague. Much more. 'More than just a good friend. 'In many ways, for me, Andy Stockwell was a life raft. 'The start of each shift, we'd have the banter in the locker room. 'Banter and business on parade. 'Then we'd be walking out to the patrol car. 'And without fail, 'he'd turn to me and say,' "Ready to do some good?" 'He'd say it like it was nothing.' A wisecrack. But I knew he meant it. I knew that this was his simple reason for being a police officer. Andy Stockwell wanted to do some good. And in the act of doing good... of doing his job... his duty... He was committed... fearless and fair. This is the man I will remember. Aren't you supposed to be getting pissed? Soon. Very soon. Any progress, sir? Yeah. Do I need to know? You might know as much as me, you're never too far away. Man in the black wool hat from your own interview, he would be interesting to talk to, if we can find him. No, sir. I don't mean any progress with Callum Rose. I couldn't care less who killed him. I mean any progress on Jonjo Heinz? No comment. OK, can I ask a question about Finch? Go on. After what he did to Andy, knowing the house would be a crime scene, why go back? The same night, why? Unless it was for something important. And does it make sense that whoever killed Finch might have been in the house looking for the same important stash? Which would make Finch's killer an associate, like the aforementioned Jonjo Heinz. Yeah, that makes sense. But what? But nothing. I keep saying it, but he was there. On the night. He was one of them. The evidence must be there somewhere. Yeah, but it has to be conclusive. Look, we are looking at all three murders. We will get to the bottom of all three murders. I was about to say, one of your interviewees called, Gerrard Frazier. He said he saw the man in the hat from his window, right? Saw him walking away, yeah. No description. He called to say he saw him cross the road and cross the path of another man. And then the second man entered the shop. Bradley Pearson. Bradley Pearson came face-to-face with our killer. Yeah, but can't remember. I'll be talking to him personally. Good luck. Sir. Everybody else left the area... Sav, come on, mate. Taxi's booked. Five minutes. I'll follow on. I don't believe you. I'll follow on, I promise. Sav? You were ace today. You made me want to do some good. I've got it. Hello. 'Please don't hang up. 'It's John Paul.' What now? 'I'm outside. 'Don't worry, I won't knock.' I won't cause trouble. But I've got something to say to you. Can I say it to your face? No. 'I'd really like to see you. 'I'll wait a while, let you think about it.' Hiya. Five minutes is all I can do. OK. You know I said you looked well? I lied. OK, you look fantastic. Stunning. You always did. I knew that. But what I didn't realise until now, yesterday in fact, was just how young you were when we met. And how brave... Have you been drinking? Yeah, I've been drinking. I've had A drink. There's a reason. As long as I know. Look, I'm not drunk. You know what, let's just forget it, shall we? No, I'm here now. So you say what you have to say. I just did. That was it. Cassie, wait. I took pictures yesterday of you and Libby. You took pictures? I'd like to show them to my dad. Give them to me. Give them to me now. I want to show her to my dad. Give them to me! I mean it. Isn't there a law against that or something? He's her granddad. I want to hit you. Fine. I really want to hit you! You have got no right to take pictures of my daughter. And before you say it, she is not yours and never will be! I imagined a civilised conversation. I want those pictures and, erm... and a written promise that you haven't made any copies or... Who's the fella? 5'10", brown jacket, light brown hair. Who is he? Is he the reason I'm getting warned off? The reason you're getting warned off, John Paul, is you. You haven't changed. You're still the centre of your world. You're still the most important person. That's not true. And yes, you're right, I was young when we met, I was very young, but most of all I must've been stupid and naive, because I loved you. I want those pictures. Cassie, my dad's a good man. Cassie! You're tense. Tense? Your dad says you've been quiet and you have no life outside of work. Is that what you two do all day, talk about me? He does. I don't. My dad thinks I should have a girlfriend. Would it change what we do? I don't do hypotheticals. Would you replace me? You're insulting me, do you know that? Sorry. Sorry. Got something to show you. Something I need to show you. It's up to you. If you don't want to look you don't have to. Who is she? The big girl's an ex. She's pretty. The little girl's my daughter. Why are you telling me? My dad doesn't know. Obviously. Up until a couple of weeks ago, I thought they were in the States. Now they're not. Will he survive the shock if I tell him? Do you think I should? Who's the guy? No idea. If you show him his granddaughter, he'll fall in love with her. He'll want to see her. If you're taking pictures on the sly, I'm guessing you're not on speaking terms. Not really. What do you want to do? I want to rewind. I want to start again. The day I saw them on the beach... The day Andy was killed... I want that day to start again. 'All units, reported a break-in, 13 Noel Road, 'registered address of Bradley Pearson.' Serious incident report. A father has taken his young son but remains on the premises. His wife suspects he may have a knife. Possible threat to life. We are requesting all necessary and appropriate support. Over. Bradley, it's Police Constable John Paul Rocksavage. Do you recognise my voice? We spoke at the shop and in the cell. What is it with you and bathrooms, mate? How's about you and little Joseph just saying hello so we know you're both OK? Bradley? Hello? 'Put her on.' OK, Bradley. I'm going to put Emma on the phone, OK? Remain calm. Bradley, stop messing about, you're scaring me. 'Who is he?' Who's who? The policeman? Your man, YOUR man. Who is it? I don't understand, what man? I wouldn't be surprised if you set it up, the kiss, and it was just a kiss, you know it was. I know, I'm sorry. So who is he?! I found a condom wrapper that was on the floor. We don't use them. That's got nothing to do with me, so will you open the door and we'll talk about it? Who else could it be?! Open the door, Bradley! Open the door and we'll talk about it. Isn't that what you want? Bradley! Listen, I want you to dial his number on my phone. Bradley? That was me calling you. John Paul. You've got my number now. If you want to talk to me in private, you can do, OK? You just call me anytime you want, OK? The Chief Inspector and a negotiator are on the way as soon as possible. A negotiator? We have to do this properly. Oh, my God. Just kick the door in! It's one bolt! It might only take five seconds but we're not sure what he'll do. Bradley? What's going on, mate? We're a little bit worried out here. Can you help us out? Bradley? Joseph wants to play with his boats. Yeah. He likes that. They do that. Oh, my God. Anytime you like Bradley, yeah? You just call, yeah, anytime, mate. Think about writing that letter. What we do know is that he's tired and stressed out. He believes his wife's having an affair. He believes she's about to move someone else into the family home. And we also believe that he might be armed. The cutlery drawer in the kitchen was open. That's it. Right. Thank you. Sir. That's it? That's about as good as we get. Sav, it's not our problem. Liam. I've just seen Jonjo Heinz getting into a car. What's going on? How come he's out? No charge. No charge? Why? He was there. I saw him there! Sav, we've had nothing back from the labs yet, and you know, maybe he could be useful to us. What's that supposed to mean? All right, look. Keep it down. No, go on. What are you saying? Costello's watching. This is neither the time or the place. Is he helping you find who killed Finch? Go away. Costello's watching. He was there. He's part of that crew. I put it in writing, what more do you want? Yeah, we've all read your second time-amended statement. And to be honest, I find it at best unreliable. I know what I saw. I'M TALKING NOW! I've cut you some slack because you lost a mate. But there's nothing yet to place Jonjo Heinz in the house at that time except your blurred say so. Should hard evidence emerge to link Mr Heinz with the murder, and it might, then we'll act upon it. But don't come into my department shouting the odds. Is that clear? Received. Hard evidence required. John Paul. Where are you going? Out for a walk. At this time of night? Again? I'll be careful. Jonjo? Jonjo, is that you? Hello? 'Constable Rocksavage?' Bradley? 'Yeah... 'Just thought I'd give you a call.' Cos I haven't got a clue what I'm doing. How are you feeling? How's your boy? Joseph's asleep. The wolves are still at the door... and I'm still here. I'm open to suggestions. Is he on his phone? Not too keen on what I'm thinking about. OK. What if, erm... What is it you want to happen, next? What would you like to happen next? What I want right now is not to feel like I feel. And I feel like a tool. Tell me again, how's Joseph doing? He's good. I'm looking at him now. He's sleeping. Was he pleased to see you? Was he happy? Yeah. I think so, I think he was. Good judge of character, is he? Would it be so hard to open the door? Open the door and say what you want. Say what you want to happen next. OK, worst case scenario. What if you're right? What if Emma has cheated? What then? Bradley, what then? I'd be gutted. Can somebody tell me who the bloody hell he's talking to? What would it mean? End of the marriage? End of the world? End of this mess that you're stuck in? Brand new start maybe? With Emma, without Emma? What? Don't know. Me neither. But what I do know is that your boy... He needs you to open the door and start again. He needs you to look after him until he's old enough to look after himself. He needs you. Still there? Still here. Where are you? Still here. Anything to tell me? Have you remembered that face? No. No chance, it's gone. Well gone. Not to worry. That's your answer. You stick to it and concentrate on your boy. Deep breath... '"I am an invisible man.' "No, I am not a spook like those who haunted Edgar Allan Poe, "nor am I one of your Hollywood movie ectoplasms. "I am a man of substance, of flesh and bone, fibre and liquids, "and I might even be said to possess a mind. "I am invisible, understand, simply because people refuse to see me. "You wonder whether you aren't simply a phantom in other people's minds. "Say, a figure in a nightmare, "which the sleeper tries with all his strength to destroy. "It's when you feel like this that, out of resentment, "you begin to bump people back. "And, let me confess, you feel that way most of the time. "You ache with the need to convince yourself "that you do exist in the real world... "That you're a part of all the sound and anguish, "and you strike out with your fists. "You curse and you swear to make them recognise you." Guess who's next? All MIT are interested in is who killed the bastard who killed Andy? What are you, a suspect?
