 Good Cop (2012): Season 1, Episode 4 - Episode #1.4 - full transcript 
 Sav continues to stalk Heinz and goes to his house at night to shoot him though he changes his mind after seeing pictures of his children. Heinz is arrested on drugs charges but DCI Costello is suspicious of Sav's great interest in him. Some time later Sav and Amanda are called to a flat where a tax accountant has been shot dead with the Finch's gun but no conclusions are drawn. Amanda agrees to act as a decoy after two men on stolen dirt bikes have been attacking and robbing young girls. The robbers strike but the police fail to catch them though later Sav,acting on a tip-off from an informant,catches up with one of them and draws his gun...

 They kicked the shit out of him. You haven't got the balls. 'Then we'd be walking out to the patrol car. 'He'd turn to me and say, "Ready to do some good?"' When this is all over, I want you to concentrate on yourself. Find something to make you smile. Cassie. You look nice. I have a life and I like it. I don't need you in it! 'Me dad thinks I should have a girlfriend.' Would it change what WE do?

 You think about being a copper, locked up. Aaagh! I haven't told anyone. I swear to God! Callum Rose was an associate of Noel Finch, who was also shot. Was it the same gun? No comment. Cal told me he'd just earned 10K for carrying boxes out of a dead man's flat. Who's the dead man? I just saw Jonjo Heinz getting into a car. What's going on? He was there. He's part of that crew. Should hard evidence emerge to link Mr Heinz with the murder, then we'll act upon it. Received. Hard evidence required. Come on then, lad! We'll race yer! Eh! On your marks!

 Get set! Tell her, I'll have her next time! Lima One. Lima One. This is Alpha Two-One, over. All units, eyes out for a dark-coloured dirt bike. 'Registration Mike, X-ray, One, One, Lima, Mike, Juliette. 'Two riders wearing black or dark casual gear, 'heading south on Commercial Road. 'It's them. We've had another one.' Nearly done, Lucy. Just a few more checks. And then we'll get you off to hospital, OK? Lucy, is that OK with you? Yeah. Good girl. Brave girl. This way, Lucy. Look at me. Has she said anything? No. You should see her arms, her hands. She put up a fight. OK, Lucy, let's get you strapped in. We're going to stay with you, OK, Lucy? Until you're settled, we're going nowhere. I don't like these two. I'm struggling to see them as people. All right, Sav? Liam. It's that time of the day. I need some sugar. Let any killers go free lately? If you're talking about Jonjo Heinz, we haven't forgotten about him. Glad to hear it. Sav, listen to me. We haven't forgotten. If there's any evidence there, we'll find it. He's right-footed, by the way. Stamped all over Andy's head with his right foot. Yeah, well, watch this space. No rush! It's only been a week. Forgotten where he lives? MOBILE RINGS Yeah? Surprised? 'Who's this?' Who's that? Jonjo? Who's that? 'It's not Callum Rose and it's not Noel Finch.' But I have met them. Guess who's next? What is it? Back gate's open. Leave it. Put something against it. Laura, I just shit meself then! It's always like that. It needs a new lock. Well, I don't do DIY. No putting your cold feet on me! KEY RATTLES IN THE LOCK Did you bolt the back door? Oh! I'll do it. I'll do it. Jonjo, will you bring me a glass of water? Yeah. HAMMER CLICKS What are you doing down here? I missed yer. THEY KISS Get to bed, you. Police! Up the stairs! Everyone clear! You were out early. Needed a walk. In your car? I drove down to the front. So was it high tide or low tide? Middle tide. You tell me. You're the sailor. Or is it detective now? You know, I don't mind you looking a little bit like me, but I do object to you being moody like me. So can we cut it out, please? Sorry. It's in the genes. OK, there IS a girl. Trouble is, she doesn't want to know. Then move on. Can't. And just how hopeless is it? Very. Does she know how you feel? Not really. Then tell her. It's times like this when I wish I'd read more romance. More? Some. What's her name? Cassandra. Greek. Is she pretty? Again, very. Oh, I don't know, son. When in doubt, go with the truth. And when she kicks you in the plums, you'll have something to hate her for. SEAGULLS CRY "You win"? What does that mean? What do I win? It means, please come and talk to me. If I had put "please come and talk to me", would you be here? Do we have anythin' to talk about? Can't we just start with the weather? The sky's full of it. Are you missing the Florida sunshine? No. Not especially. I missed the cold when we were there. I missed wearing hats, scarves, gloves. I like wearing layers. I like coming here when it's blowing a gale and the tide's in, and the water's bouncing off the walls. I stand on the railings and pretend I'm on a ship. So where's this ship you're on sailing to? No idea. No imagination. I did well to find a boat. I am sorry, Cass. It's... It's gone. It happened. Are you a family, Cass? You, the guy, Libby? Are you all together? What if we were? Do you love him? What if we were...a family? Then that's good. For you, that's good. I would love it for me dad to know he had a granddaughter. He deserves to be remembered by someone better than me. What about you, John Paul, what do you want? What is it that you think you deserve from all of this? Nothing. Absolutely, nothing. What I want... is for you to be OK. First and foremost. If that means me walking away, staying away, I will. I want your daughter to be my daughter. I want to hold her hand on this beach. I want to stop her from standing on jellyfish. None of which I deserve. That's it. That's all I've got, Cass. What I really want... is to be around to keep her safe. BELL RINGS, DOOR BUZZES Thanks, Sarge. I heard there was an arrest warrant served this morning on Jonjo Heinz. Was it a hit? It was. Is he still here? He is. Mind if I take a peek? Remind meself what a twat looks like. Number three. Cheers, Sarge. DOOR BUZZES What? Yeah, that's right. Have a good look. Walk away, you, yer little fanny! MOBILE RINGS All right, Dad. I'm just about to go on parade. I was just about to start Crime And Punishment, but if you'd rather we did a Barbara Cartland. Thanks very much. What happened to the sympathetic ear? 'I'm serious, son.' I don't know anything about women. And it appears you know even less. Ah! Justine's here. Shall I ask her? No, that's negative. 'John Paul wants to know how to woo...' ..a woman. Is that right? Dad, pack it in. 'Tell him a romantic dinner for two...' ..never goes out of fashion. Did you hear that? Hi, bollocks. 'Look, I'm joking, son.' If you think she's worth making a fool of yourself for, then you do it. 'Oh, and I appreciate you asking me for my advice, 'even though it's not worth a carrot.' Yeah, you're right. Right, I've got to go. 'Well, you be careful out there.' Will do. Speak to you later, Pop. How is your dad? Is he all right? Yeah, he's good, thanks. Must be close to hell on earth though, having to sit in your house all day. Well, he's got his books. That's what you need, innit? A good book to while away the years. Eh, I went for a drink with Amanda last night. Oh, well done. She can drink! And she was saying how she loves working with you. Good. Are you interested, you know, romantically? Romantically, what...? If you want me to be crude, I'll be crude. I've told you, she's another copper, that's all, a mate. If you want to step in, then go ahead. She's out of your league, but... PHIL LAUGHS By all means make a fool out of yourself. Yeah, well, if you don't ask, you don't get. You tosser. Sal... DCI Costello was asking after you. I told him we'd be along after parade. We? Yeah, WE. Last night, we had another attack on a female. Same MO. Lone female, two white males and a stolen dirt bike. How many's that now? Six. Last night, a 19-year-old student. Fractured cheekbone, collarbone and ribs. All happened in the space of a minute. And they enjoyed it, all of it - the attack and the chase. You gave chase? On foot until the bike arrived. And did you get a good look at him? No. Any local intel, Sarge? Nothing yet. Community bobbies are pushing it, as should we. Any contacts we have on the ground should be used. Traffic cameras? No, limited and useless. The facts are, the level of violence is increasing. Something much more serious is just around the corner and we CAN'T let it happen. Which is why Constable Morgan's been asked, and agreed, to pose as a student, later tonight, a special op. What, a goat on a rope? Whose idea was that? I think she should dress provocatively, Sarge, like she's on a slut walk. You're not funny! I'm telling you, bees need honey. From 2100 hours, the entire block will be in and around the student area of the city. Just the block, Sarge? No support? Two CID officers will be involved. Two? At the moment, two. The Chief Inspector will be advising the details at a pre-op briefing. These guys don't give any warning. From the word go, they attack. You saw what he did to the girl last night. I know. And you're comfortable with that? I don't intend to be passive. If you don't see the first punch, you can't defend it. What's the alternative! Put Philly in a frock? Have we got the chopper? Can't afford it and...it's not our turn. This gets better! This is a bad idea, Sarge. And you're a mug for going along with it! It's my decision. There's better ways to get commendations! OK, Sav! That's enough! - Yeah, more than enough! - You've made your point. The idea will be to maintain visual contact with Amanda at all times. As I said, the details will be covered in a later briefing. KNOCK AT DOOR Sir. Yeah. Come in. Sit down. I'm told you went to see an arrest of mine, Jonjo Heinz. Yes. Why? To see him for meself. And to wind him up. We only took him in this morning. How did you know he was in the cells? Your shift started half an hour ago. The truth? Sir, I was sitting outside his house when the warrant was executed. You were sitting outside his house at 5.30 this morning? I couldn't sleep, sir. Don't be clever, Sav. The hole's big enough as it is. I thought about knocking on his door meself. And then what? Don't know. Hit him. Knock him out. I found the idea of him getting away with murder difficult to swallow. Your mate being killed is no excuse for stupid, irrational, suspicious behaviour! Apologies. Did you sit outside Noel Finch's house, Callum Rose's house? No, sir. What are you, Rocksavage? A witness? A weakness? A suspect? What would we find if we knocked on your door? A cup of tea and a biscuit, sir. You're very welcome to knock on my door any time you like. But you're right, going to his house was a stupid thing to do. Is Heinz going to be charged, sir? Thank you, Sergeant. Sorry for disrupting your day. Not a problem. Is Heinz going to be charged, sir? It's none of your business, Sav. Actually, Sergeant, it is. Because although we can prove he was with Finch's mob, the day that PC Stockwell was murdered, what we can't do is we can't prove he was at the house when the killing occurred. What we need to do that is a reliable witness! Key word being "reliable"! Not some obsessive, compulsive, bell-end who enjoys sitting outside a suspect's house for no GOOD REASON! Heinz is on a drugs charge. It will do for now! But you damage this investigation any further and I swear I will damage you! Get him out of here before I throw something! You heard the man, Sav. Let's go. Sav! What's going on inside that thick head? What are you playing at? Privacy cupboard. Your turn to say something. Make it good. Heinz is going to end up getting away with this, or on a lesser charge. We don't know that. If it happens, you deal with it. At best, we'll get manslaughter and he'll be out in five years tops! I can't handle that. Do you know what, Sav? I don't think you're up to a shift. I should pull you. You can't. Yes, I CAN. If I don't think your head's in the right place, I can do anything I like. How long have you been a bobby? How long? Seven years. How many pats on the back? A few. More than a few. But all that's in danger of flying out the window. Forget about MIT. Forget about CPS. Forget about what you cannot do. Concentrate on what you can do. And tonight, that should be looking after Amanda, not slagging her off for stepping up to the plate. Tonight, she needs you. Took your time! Am I worth the wait? Amanda, listen. I swear I won't say another word about you volunteering. Yeah, you will. OK, I probably will. Does this mean you care? No. I'd say the same thing to Philly. Maybe not. I don't know. I didn't really look at him. I was too busy... shouting and screaming and waving my arms about. Which you did brilliantly, by the way. If you didn't see his face, what did you see? Anything, anything at all? Erm... An earring. One of them diamond stud types. Like the footballers wear. Blingy. Yeah. In his left ear. Was it round or square? Er... Square. Excellent. He put his hand over my mouth and I bit him really hard. Nice one. I hope they give you a tetanus jab. That's all. That's all. I really was just concentrating on making as much noise as possible. Sorry. Sorry for what? You've got every right to be upset. But you stood up to that bastard, Lucy, and you won. You hear me? Yeah. What are you studying? Law. Rather you than me. Don't let this knock you off course, OK? We will find him. Sorry, it's stupid and wrong, but I don't think I want you to find him. I just want it to be over. I want it to be over and I want him to be gone for good. Does he know we can see him? I'm not sure. I'll wait in the car. All right there, Constable. Kyle, what are you doing? Meeting you. You're trying out car doors. You can see me watching you and you're still doing it. Why? I don't know. Habit? And what if one was open? You're your own worst enemy. I can't help it. I wouldn't have taken anything. Yes, you would. You'd have waited for me to leave and then you'd have taken something. Sav, swear to God, I wouldn't. Anyway, I need a favour. If I can. It's important. OK. I'm looking for two mates. Two pieces of shit who go round on a dirt bike. What colour? The bike's dark. I think black. They're attacking young women. Assault, sexual assault and robbery, so far. It's getting worse each time. That's bad that. That's scum. Yeah, it is bad. I don't necessarily need names. An area would be nice, a street name even better. Any ideas yourself about where they hang out? I'm thinking the Brow maybe. They seem to know that area. Will you keep your eyes out? Ear to the ground? Yeah. 20. It's all I've got. Sav, Sav. I don't want your money, lad. I'm not a grass. But you'll do it? Yeah. I said I would, didn't I? I'm a citizen. I've got sisters. You're a good lad, Kyle. So when are you gonna stop the thieving? Ah, I dunno. I think I'm flawed. HE LAUGHS Hey, have you done it with her yet? See you later. I would! Kyle! I can see yer! Stop! 'Alpha Two-One. Assistance required... '..Investigating suspicious apartment...' Are you meeting Christopher Tomley? That's right, yeah. That's me. I've got a spare key for the apartment. I am the keeper of the keys. I'm trying to give up. Again! This way. The block chairman has a spare key for all the flats. The rule is that it can't be used in the absence of the owner, without express permission of a nominated person, or the police. Who's the nominated person? In Mr Grey's case, there wasn't one. Which is why you're here. Are the security cameras working? Oh, yeah. Pointless if they're not. Everything works. When was the last time you saw Mr Grey? I was thinking about that. It must be two, three weeks maybe. Is that unusual? Not really. But something's wrong. I think I'm right. There's a definite smell. Are police allowed to wear make-up? A bit. Never knew. Are you getting the whiff now? Not yet. It's there. Peppermint. Here we go. Dear God! I think we can rule out a mouse. You wait at the door, please. OK? Mm-hm. Oh! Jesus Christ! Lima One, Lima One. This is Alpha Two-One, over. 'Go ahead, Alpha Two-One.' Serious but non-urgent, Debs. There's been a shooting. One fatality. West Street apartments. Number 235. Looks and smells like the shooting occurred a number of weeks ago. Require MIT and private ambulance. Over. 'Roger that, Sav.' I take it he's dead? Can you wait outside, please? Mr Tomley. Can you wait outside, please? And don't touch anything. The name on the tenancy agreement is Martin Paul Grey. He'd been living here alone since March 2008. Not many visitors. Works from home, possibly as an accountant. But I'm guessing from the books on tax law, VAT. I've had a cursory look around and there seems to be a few things missing. Like what? There's no sign of a computer or a phone. And the filing cabinet's mostly empty. His client list might be interesting. All right. Thanks, Sav. Is it true you've only got Jonjo Heinz on a drugs charge? Possession and supply. Sav, it's a start. It got us into his girlfriend's house for a good look around. OK. Are we needed? I'll ask. Definitely matches, yeah? I'm guessing, not. Had to be you, didn't it? - who discovered the body. We were nearest, sir. Do you know what this is? Same bullet type that killed Noel Finch AND Callum Rose. Same gun? Possibly. So we could be looking at Finch's work. And that could be the reason why he went back into the house, to fetch a murder weapon. So the next question is, who controlled Finch? Who authorised this kill? And the answer, Constable Rocksavage, is none of your business. No, sir. So you go and do your job. Let me do mine. Is that what you'll be saying when we're knocking on doors, sir? I thought we were part of a team. Tell your sergeant, I do not want this copper anywhere near my incident room. Is that clear? You've made your point, sir. I hope so. Thank you. LOCK BEEPS I need a cig. I'm fumin'. Is he allowed to talk to us like that? It's me he's got the problem with. I don't care. It's bad manners. He's all excited about the idea of a turf war. Oh, he's a gobshite! Enjoying that? I'm a kissogram. No tax pennies being wasted. Are you on your own? If you're coming in, I'm not. How do I look? Studious? I'd occupy the refectory with you, yeah. What you're doing is top drawer. I mean it. But you're still a goat on a rope. Between you and me, I'm bricking it. My stomach's doing flips. It's bound to. I won't be too far away. You better not be. Ready to do some good? Group hug? You might be aware of this, but if you kick a man in the nuts it makes his eyes water. Noted. You can change your mind. No, I can't. SIRENS BLARE SARGE: 'Base to goat, over.' Hear you loud and clear, base, over. 'Base to all units, comms check. Stand by. Base to goat. 'Advise position, over.' Goat to all units. Passing Concert Square. Going in the direction of Slater Street and Berry Street, over. Anyone out there? Over. 'Alpha Two-One received.' Alpha Two-Two received. 'Alpha Two-Three with a roger.' 'Taxi one, roger. Right behind you, goat.' SARGE: 'Amanda. 'Ten minutes there, then we'll move on to area three. 'Then we go round again. And we keep going round.' Roger, base. SARGE: 'Whenever you're ready, goat.' Going round again, base. 'Roger, we're always close.' 'Lima One, to all units. Reports of a disturbance at the Firewall nightclub.' 'Alpha Two-Three. Are we clear to respond to the Firewall shout? We're just around the corner.' Let it go, Gaz. SARGE: 'Stand by, Alpha Two-Three.' We stay put. 'Alpha Two-Three, you're clear to respond to Firewall. 'Base to goat. 'We're going to call it a night.' Received that base. Can't say I'm disappointed. MOTORBIKE REVS To all units, I've just had sight of a dirt bike, over. It could be something or nothing. Over. Aaah! She's been hit! She's been hit! Aah! Aah! Aah! Strike! Help! Aah! 'All units, girl under attack in Liverpool one.' Aaah! Aaah! SIREN BLARES Aaah! Police! Amanda! SIREN BLARES Alpha Two-One to base and all units. Trials bike spotted headed south on Commercial Road. 'That's south on Commercial Road.' Amanda. SIREN BLARES 'Ambulance required, Pilgrim's Lane. We'll stay with her.' Dirt bike has collected a passenger. I'm staying with them. SARGE: 'Request speed and location.' Turning right into Hoxton Road. SIREN BLARES SARGE: 'Keep feeding speed and location, Sav. 'Alpha Two-One, request speed and location.' Onto the Dock Road. He's pushing 60 or more. Accelerating. 70. Accelerating. Staying with them. 75. SARGE: 'Alpha Two-One, pull back.' Staying with them to 80. 'End pursuit, over. 'Sav, do you read? Sav! Sav! It's too fast. 'And too dangerous! You know the rule. We CANNOT endanger life. 'End the pursuit! Sav! 'Last chance, Sav! Sav, for God's sake call it off! 'There'll be a next time! Please! Sav!' What's the fucking point?! Cheers, mate. Here's Sarge. Oh, here's your bollocking. And he's walking with purpose. How is she? She's OK. She's sitting up. I'll save our discussion till tomorrow, shall I? Do it now, if you like. We can make ourselves scarce. I'm more concerned than disappointed. I think you're looking at time off and a trip to the psych. I don't need time off. You don't have any say in the matter. Par for the course. What was the point in tonight if all we were going to do at the end of it is let them go? Amanda almost gets killed and we do nothing! Andy did get killed and all MIT are interested in is who killed the bastards who killed Andy! She'd like to see you. Have a look in and then meet me outside. I'll give you a life home or... to collect your car. No need to report tomorrow. You NEED to rest. My hero. Hey. Looking good. You suit a little bit of colour on your face. Funny man. I see he had you by the throat. The siren saved me. You were right. The first punch and my head was spinning. No, you did good. You recovered and you got your call out. It was a shit plan. Yeah. It was a shit plan. What was going on with the pursuit? You don't want to know. Yeah, I do. That's why I asked. I had them. I was right on their tail. All I had to do was touch their back wheel. And I was going to do it. Problem solved. But end of career. It wouldn't have mattered. I wouldn't have cared. It's a jail sentence. Suspended. I still wouldn't have cared. They'll do it again. They had a great time. They're laughing and joking about it right now. It's not worth a good man going to jail. You know, next time, Amanda, they WILL kill. You know it. I know it. They know it. They will kill. And we will get them. When? Before or after? Eh... I was half copper, half dog tonight. I chased a motorbike. Did you catch it? Almost. Do you want this? Yeah. There's two guys riding round attacking women for something to do. Nasty. You OK? What would you think if I said, I caught them and killed them? What do you mean, what would I think? What would you think? Would you think I was a hero? A tool? You wouldn't be a hero. You wouldn't think they deserved it? No. Why not? Why? Because they've got no idea of what it's like to be a proper human being. No compassion, no thought. So they deserve to die? Who'd miss them? That's not the point. You kill them and you're no different. I'm a nurse. What did you expect me to say? You'll have to tell me how you do it. Keep your life in these little boxes. A minute at a time. But if you want me to stay a bit longer and listen, I will. No. Not required. I want to follow you home though. Make sure you get there safely. It's a nice thought... but, no, never. WATER RUNS INTO A GLASS A DISTANT SIREN WAILS MOTORBIKE DRONES "He scarcely looked at the passers-by. "Tried to escape looking at their faces at all. "And to be as little noticeable as possible. "When he had happened to imagine all this beforehand, "he had sometimes thought he would be very much afraid. "But he was not very much afraid now. "He was not afraid at all. Indeed, his mind..." MOBILE RINGS Sorry, Dad. It can't be helped. Sorry, let me... PHONE CONTINUES TO RING I'll pretend I'm watching an ad break, shall I? PHONE RINGS AGAIN Kyle. 'I know it's late.' But those two lads on a dirt bike. 'I'm looking at them right now. 'Are you still interested? 'Hello, Sav.' Yeah. Tell me where and get yourself off the streets and home. You understand? All right, lad. I'll see you later. KNOCK-KNOCK-KNOCK Who's that? Police. Open up. Come on. We haven't got all night. Have you got any ID? Open up and you can see all the ID you want. Armed police, did I say? Changing our MO are we? From bike to van. The bike's not mine. What's the plan now? Drag them in the back, abduction? Knock them senseless at your leisure? Bring them back here and then what? Rape? Inflict a bit of pain? A bit of terror? Cos you're tough like that, aren't you? I know you enjoy that. And then what? A knife? No. You like the bare-handed approach, don't you? I said, DON'T YER? I haven't got a clue what you're talking about, but I know you're not police! Oh yes, I am. Turn your head to the right. What? Turn your head to the right!! I know all about you. I'm right about you enjoying it, aren't I? This going all over my head! You can't leave it alone, can yer? I don't know what you're talking about! You've got to keep pushing and pushing. Next time it will be for keeps, right? Next time, you'll kill! Then again and again and again! Listen, lad, right. I haven't understood a word... You had your hands around a friend of mine's neck! She was half your size! You squeezed... Wrong! It wasn't me! It never is, is it? KYLE GASPS FOR AIR Aah! Sav... Sav, I won't say nothin'.

"But still uttered no sound, "as though she could not get breath to scream. "He rushed at her with the axe. Her mouth twitched piteously. "And this hapless Lizaveta was so simple "and had been so thoroughly crushed and scared "that she did not even raise a hand to guard her face." John Paul... What is it? Long day. Never endin'.
