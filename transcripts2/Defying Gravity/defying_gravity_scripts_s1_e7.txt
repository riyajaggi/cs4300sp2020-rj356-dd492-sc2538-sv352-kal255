 Defying Gravity (2009): Season 1, Episode 7 - Fear - full transcript 
 It's Hollowe'en and the crew are going to make a commercial, the first of 8 during their voyage, for a candy bar company that is also a major sponsor of the mission. Several of the crew begin to have hallucinations: Zoe is still hearing a crying baby; Donner continues to see Mars dust on instruments; Nadia sees a shadowy figure moving about their quarters; Paula sees her pet dog; and on Earth, even Eve is seeing things. Eve thinks that the sentient force on board the Antares wants to be revealed. Zoe and Connor realize they've been having the same dream. In flashbacks, Zoe has recovered from the termination of her pregnancy, but feels that everybody of watching her. Ted tells Eve exactly what happened on the earlier Mars mission.

 Mwah, ha, ha, ha, ha! From all of us down here on terra firma... we'd like to wish you folks a little nearer the spirit world a happy Halloween. Hey, what happened, baby? I thought you said you were gonna wear a mask. Very funny. Aw, Paula. We both dressed up as zombies. - This is just embarrassing. - Save your insults, Steven. I can already wiggle my thumb. Okay, yo, yo, yo. Careful with that. A lot of work went into that little digit, okay? We do copy the movement, though, Paula. That's great news. Well, nothing's keeping me off Venus.

 [Maddux Narrating] One of the first things you learn in training... doesn't come from a manual. It's instinctual, Darwin-type stuff. Never show weakness. Surgeon, she's looking pale. Do you have anything? Yeah. Slightly elevated heart rate and temperature at the moment. Could be a response to the oxygen. - Her hand's infection-free and healing well. - [Sighs] Keep me updated. [Maddux Narrating] It doesn't matter that you're frightened or hurt or having a bad day. No one cares what you're going through. They only care if you can get thejob done. [Mike] Okay, folks, today's the big day. So other than the task at hand, it's light marching orders for everyone. How about we give a nice, big friendly wave to our guests...

 from the Comet Candy Company... who are here to watch you make your commercial today. Yes, they're very excited to see you trick-or-treat in space. - I know I certainly am. - Well, we're all pretty excited up here. As you can tell. Copy that. Okay, I'm gonna turn things over to your director, David Sellner. He's gonna be calling the shots. Yeah, we all know Dave from training. Hey, man. You guys look great. Listen, we're gonna keep it real simple. - The most important thing is just have a good time. - Copy that. It'll be exactly what we rehearsed in training. You all step off the ship, move to your marks. Nadia, you unfold the banner with the Canadarm... and you all say "Trick or treat," and we make broadcast history. Piece of cake. You heard him, folks. Piece of cake. - It's a busy day, so we'll let you all get to work. - [Beeps] - Well, this goes without saying, Paula. - I can do it. - You cannot. - [Evram] You can't. Jen will replace you in the E.V. A... and you can shoot a "making of"video for your classroom, okay? Your thumb's gonna thank you, Paula. Yeah, you don't wanna risk more damage from some stupid commercial. How much are they putting into the program anyway? - I heard 10 billion. - [Jen] What? - Ten billion to advertise a candy bar? - It's prostitution. It's tradition. Russia used commercials to pay for Mir back in the '90s. Guys, get used to it. There's gonna be eight more along the way. Let's go. - Ted, I can do this. - No puedes. Let's go. [Maddux Narrating] Everything is A-OK. All systems go. Ready for liftoff. Every astronaut knows the rules of thejungle. Limping antelope don't go into space. They stay on Earth, where they're killed and eaten. - I'm a freak. - You're not a freak. I'm worse than a freak. I am a pathetic, recently spayed, wannabe astronaut... condemned to the barren existence of a space nun. They are looking at me. I've seen that look before. That is the way you look at a dying pet. Those are looks of awe and amazement. - They're amazed I'm eating my lunch? - They're amazed you're moving. I get my uterus out, and I am on the floor, in a ball, bowl of ice cream next to me. That was day two. I am better now. - Should you even be here? - I'm fine, okay? In fact, I feel terrific. - You ought to be home in bed though. - I heal quickly. - I'm just saying. - Well, I'm A-OK, Donner. Yes. Please. [Laughs] Go. So does this mean that you're going to go to the Halloween shindig tonight? The way I feel? Not a chance. Well, I think I'm gonna go- either as a pirate wench or a vampire slut. Not sure. But, you know, either way it's fishnets. - Ted likes fishnets? - All men like fishnets. It's genetic. Zoe, I just wanted to say- No, Ajay. You don't say anything, nothing. If you're going to sit here, all you can do is eat. - Would you like half of my sandwich? - Why, because I look weak? Because I look like I need more food? You're a freak. [Whirring, Beeping] Is there an increase in gamma? [Man] Nothing we can see. My temperature's rising. I feel a pulse coming on. [Breathing Heavily] Open! Go, go, go! Close. [Breathing Heavily] Ted Shaw. [Ted] Apulse? Do you mean like a heartbeat? No. It's more like a wave. It builds to a peak and then ends. I've only had it happen a few times. - Are you feeling flushed or feverish? - Yeah. A little. Well, you may experience more intense hallucinations. - Like Mintz? - Possibly. You know he's convinced that his med patches were psychotropic. And he should keep believing that. Is anyone else experiencing anything? 'Cause Paula's running a low-grade fever. Her hand is healing. Donner did hint at something about a week ago but hasn't mentioned anything since. [Laughs] Well, he's an astronaut. Astronauts aren't the only ones that hold things back, Mrs. Shaw. I know. But I'm telling you now, Ted. Keep your eye on them and on yourself. Oh, hey. Thanks. I'll take him. - Look who Mama's talking to. - Daddy. - Hey, Roy boy. - Tell him why you're here. Watch him in the commercial. You know when I wave from outer space, who I'm gonna be waving to? You. We're gonna go trick-or-treating with some of the other kids. - And have you decided who you're gonna be? - Dr. Ra. Ah. Dr. Ra. I don't wanna go. Some of the other kids have him freaked out. Ghosts and graveyards and- - Ah. So you don't wanna go trick-or-treating. - It's dark. It's really dark where Daddy's gonna be trick-or-treating. But you know what I do when I'm scared? I think about all the candy I'm gonna have when I'm done. Trust me. It's gonna be worth your while. Baby astronauts can't be scared. [Jen] So let me get this straight. Four of the most highly trained human beings ever are about to use their skills... to step into the deep, unforgiving darkness of space... so that we can go trick-or-treating for $10 billion. And if something goes wrong, we get to die on live TV. I'll tell you the truth. I don't really care what the risks are. I'll do pretty much anything if it means hours outside the ship. And I'll freely admit it- I'm an E.V.A. Whore. [Laughs] Whore. And $10 billion buys a whole lot of science, by the way. - [Maddux] Mm-hmm. - Science? Yeah. The ship and mission dollars are already guaranteed before launch. These commercials pay for the gravy. Oh, whoa. Wait a minute. Since when did the science become the gravy? - Yeah. Isn't that why we're up here in the first place? - [Chuckles] [Chuckles] Oh, you mean in addition to the flag planting... and the, uh, industrial exploration and the mining rights. Let me ask you. What's the first thing to get cut during a budget squeeze? - The science. - Yeah. The science. Trick or treat, ladies. Trick or treat. It's my favorite holiday. I'm on a spaceship, and it feels like ass. It's the isolation. You're missing other people. No, it's the fact that I'm stuck with a bunch of tight-butts... that won't make the effort to wear a little costume. I mean, everybody up here is so afraid of looking stupid. Whatever happened to that spirit of Major Tom's? That's what I wanna know. - Major Tom's is 35 million kilometers away. - So? We're astronauts living in a tin can hurtling through a vacuum. Somehow getting dressed up like vampires and pirate wenches loses its appeal. Not to mention the fact that El Dia de los Muertos is a day to honor the dead... not to pervert them. Do you guys ever get, like, really bad cramping... when you keep your butt cheeks clenched together that tightly? - [Laughs] - Okay... Sellner wants us to use cameras 24... 35, 92 and 120. Nadia, you wanna move the arm so 92 could see it? Who are you? Who's who? [Paula] Nadia? Nadia! "May your days be peaceful and... - filled with good-" - "Filled with good health." It's not a bad Dr. Ra. - Why, thank you. - You're welcome. Oh, you're-you're missing the belt. You know, they said you were detail oriented. Oh, really? What else did they say? - That you were mysterious. - Hmm. And influential. And somebody said you were good-looking. You know. The exact opposite of anyone from I.S.O. [Scoffs] They're not that bad. Well, you're only saying that because they employ you. Actually, I work for a subcontractor. And they said that you're involved with, uh, training and crew selection. Yeah. A little bit of everything, which is part of why I wanna talk to you- to get to know you a little better. How about after work tomorrow, for drinks? How about now? And I should warn you. It might get a little detail oriented. It's only gonna take a few minutes of your time. It's about Mars. [Jen] You sure you don't wanna come? I have an extra pair of fishnets. Yeah, I'm not up to being vampy. I'm thinking hot bath and a bed. - Hey. - Hey. - Hey. - Hi. You, uh- You-You feeling all right? Yeah. Never better. And you are? Oh, I'm Greg Maddux. It's, uh, my namesake. He was a Hall of Fame pitcher back in the 1900s. Nice. Nice. Your father gave it to you in high school. You, uh, haul it out every year at Halloween? Yeah. Something like that. - What are you supposed to be? - I'm a baseball cheerleader. Baseball doesn't have cheerleaders. - She's from Germany. - I'm a German baseball cheerleader. - In fishnets? Nice touch. - I'm sorry you won't be coming, Zoe. You must be very weak. Such an ordeal. We all were talking about how awful you must feel. - Please, get some rest. - Yeah. Take it easy, okay? - Thank you. I will. Good night. - Okay. Bye. Okay, so now I wanna go trick-or-treating. - I don't feel like trick-or-treating, Nadia. - I do. ##[Man Vocalizing] #I don't know when # - #I don't know how # - [Sniffles] ##[Vocalizing] #I'll make it up # # To you somehow # [Beeps] - ##[Vocalizing] - Hi. - Give me 20 minutes. I'm coming. - [Baby Crying] What's the matter? Nothing. It was nothing. Well, you just turned your head like you- Yeah, I thought I heard someone come in. I was wrong. - Want me to zip you up? - Sure. - Thanks. - Yeah. Now, see, that's what I'm talking about. Zoe just had a hard spike. I'm getting them from Ted, Paula, Evram and Donner. They're also running low-grade fevers. So am I. From all the way down here? Eve? Distance doesn't seem to matter. [Gasps] [Mike] So Beta is causing these hallucinations. We're not sure how many of them are actually hallucinating... but they're experiencing something. Elevated heart rates and body temperatures. - Like you've experienced in the past? - And I'm experiencing now. Typically, Beta's pulse will crescendo and then recede. - And where are we in this symphony? - Oh, it's getting louder. Why? Why now? What is it trying to do? We're about to broadcast live to millions of people around the world. L-I don't think it's a coincidence. What would it have to gain? We've been hiding it- from the crew, from the world. I don't know. Maybe it wants to be revealed. No. Not now. Not on its terms. No. Not now. Not on its terms. - Do we have an alternative? - Only one. We believe that this particular lot oflibido inhibitors... is contaminated. What we're seeing indicates that at the far end of the spectrum... there may be a chemical reaction that acts like a psychotropic. - What? - Hold on. Hang on. So, your astronauts are on acid? No, but there is the potential for disorientation and mild hallucinations. - Awesome. - The contaminant hasn't been pinpointed just yet... but we're analyzing it right now. In the meantime, I don't think anyone wants to jeopardize the safety of our crew... for a candy commercial. [Gasps] - Nadia. - Evram. I thought-You scared me. - Really? You? - [Exhales] - You feeling all right? - I'm fine. I'm fine. Then come back to the airlock with me. A contaminated batch of HALOs? Seriously? I mean, I feel great. All of us are running low-grade fevers except forJen and Wass. And I'm worried it might be psychotropic. You mean, like, cause hallucinations? Certainly explains what's been happening to me. Well, we're still gonna shoot the commercial? - I think they're in a meeting. - [Zoe] Whoa, whoa, whoa. This is $ 10 billion of scientific research we're talking about. All we have to do is go out there on tethers and say "Trick or treat." An hour ago, you thought it was a complete waste of time. That was before we realized what it funded. They pull back on the programs, nothing we do up here will get properly analyzed. Yeah, at least not in our lifetime. We don't do this commercial, you can be damn sure they're not gonna give us the money. You realize this is notjust another candy commercial. This is an international event. We have purchased commercial airtime across the planet. We understand it would be a pretty high-profile scrub. And, of course, we would expect our expenses to be covered. That's in excess of one billion U.S. Dollars... in addition to the $ 10 billion that you would not be getting from us for this mission. Let's not get crazy. We can just reschedule this for the flyby to Mars next year. Next year? Who's gonna give a rat's ass about this mission next year? It'll be old news by then. Look, uh, the money's obviously substantial, Mike. - We'd need to make, uh, cuts to certain programs. - The science. But if we're talking about potential problems and not actual problems... why don't we put it to the crew? See how they feel. I feel fine. L-I'm perfect. And I'm certainly not hallucinating. Not about to lose those science dollars. Good to go. Not quite sure what you guys are talking about... but happy to take the HALO off if that's gonna do it. [Nadia] That's two of us. Listen, I, uh, promised my son I would wave to him from outer space... and that's what I intend to do. [Evram] From where I'm standing, everyone is medically sound... and unimpeded- - as am I. - Astronauts. Guess we're ready to go. Let's get on with it then. Yes, sir. Antares, you're good to go. [Ted] Copy that. [Kids Chattering] - [Man] Hey, kids. - [Woman] So cute. [Chattering Continues] - Hi, Mommy. - Hi, baby. Time for Dr. Ra? Yes, it's time for Dr. Ra. - How are you? - [Roy] Good. Hey! Hope you're ready. Zoe, Rollie said that Ted is going as Dr. Ra... so I figured I would show up as Medic Zu. What are you going as anyway? Something I will never be. Oh, no. No, no, no. [Chattering] - ##[Blues On Speakers] - #Baby, since you've been gone # # Well, it's been too long, baby # - #Baby, since you've been gone # - Oh, my God. - #I wanna be the first to tell you, baby # - Oh, my God. #Pretty baby, welcome home ## Yeah. Pregnant astronaut, folks. That's right. You can stop your puppy-dog stares... because I'm back, and I'm, uh, laughing at it with you. Classic case of overcompensation. She's probably on all sorts of meds. I hope she's smart enough to not drink. I need a drink. This is a disaster waiting to happen. All right, Nadia, are you and Wass ready on the arm and cameras? Roger that. We are... good to go. Ted? You guys all set? [Ted] Roger. Just waiting on the trick-or-treat buckets. All right, I'm gonna turn you over to David in a minute. - We are 12 minutes and counting to air. - [Ted] Copy. [Paula] By the time you guys see this... you probably would have seen the Comet Candy commercial about a hundred times. But this is a behind-the-scenes look at how we did it. The astronauts are just about ready to enter the airlock... - that is their pathway to space. - [Dog Whining] [Dog Whimpering] The airlock is where we depressurize the atmosphere... - uh, to that of- - [Whimpering] Until it's the same as... outer space. And then we can, uh- - [Whimpering] - Open the outer airlock door, and we can- Hector? Hector? Paula. Paula! - Ted, you okay? - I'm fine. All nominal. I'm sweating like crazy. I think we ought to be doing a deodorant commercial. Ajay. Any way you can pump some more A.C. Into these suits? Yeah. Let me see what we can do. [Claire] Ted's heart rate is near 130. Zoe and Donner- 120 plus. Which one's Daddy? The big astronaut, babe. Come on. Let's go to Mommy's station. I'll give you a headset and you can listen in. - Are they all right? - Yeah. [David] Okay, folks, we're at T-minus 10 until airtime. Opening the media feeds now. Hector? - Paula, where are you going? - [Gasps] Oh! Hector! Help me! - Paula. - Oh, it's okay, boy. He's dying. Oh, my God. Help me. Oh, my God. Who is dying? Who's dying? - Shh. It's okay. - Paula. - Who's dying? - It's my dog, Hector. He's dying. - [Crying] - Paula, Hector's not here. It's okay, boy. Help me, please. He's dying. Paula. Paula, he's a hallucination. All right? [Gasps] [Baby Crying] - You're doing it again. - What? That thing that you just did. It's like you're hearing something. - What are you hearing? - I don't know what you're talking about. Hey, guys, you mind if we save the small talk until after we get this done? [Ted] Did I tell you my boy's watching? Roy's down in Mission Control. I'm gonna wave to him. Well, all right. Let's do this for Roy. And $10 billion. - Science forever. - And forever science. [Ted] Flight, depressurizing airlock. [Rollie] Copy that, Antares. - [Ted] Outer hatch opening. - [Rollie] You're good to go. Mag grav coming off. And mag grav off. Copy. All right, guys. Let's do this. [Breathing Heavily] Ted. Ted, is there a problem? [Eve] I understand you not wanting to talk about the mission. Probably pretty painful. But we're going back there, and I want experienced astronauts on this crew. It's not much I can say that you can't read about. I wanna hear it firsthand from you. Right. The detail lady. Mm-hmm. God is in the details. Look, I don't know if you've ever felt responsible... for losing anyone. I have. Same as you. And it haunts me all the time. Tell me about the storm. [Ted] Donner and I were packing up the hab. It was our last sol on the mission. Sharon and Walker? Sharon and Walker were about five kilometers out in the rover... picking up experiments, some last-minute stuff. The rover broke down in the dust... so they had to cover that by foot. And the storm just- Did it take you by surprise? We were expecting it, but... we just didn't know how bad. You try to plan pretty well for everything. You have all of your contingencies covered... do everything that is humanly possible so you won't fail- fail your crewmates, fail the mission. It just all happened so fast. One, two, three! I'm not paying for these! Whoo! - Ow! - That's got to be, like, her sixth shooter. Will you please stop worrying about Zoe Barnes? She's a big girl, Donner. She can take care of herself. Hmm. [Jen] I can't believe this. How can he not just pick up and say "I'm busy"? He's probably too busy. You know what? I'm not even asking for an explanation. I just want a little common courtesy... because I'm telling you, putting together Medic Zu at the last minute is not easy. Please. I'll bet you had the wig and the top in your closet already. I know the stockings were. - Hey, I am looking for a sympathetic ear here. - Not gonna get one from me. - Come on. Let's dance. - No, no, no, no, no. - Last thing you wanna do is dance. - No, the last thing I wanna do... is look like the last thing I wanna do is dance. - You get it? - I get it. Wanna dance? - A pregnant astronaut drinking. - [Laughs] I like it. - To the baby. - To the baby. So, uh, Doc Ra a no-show? Never trust a Vortan. [Laughs] Right. Can you tell me what the hell's going on? Uh, Ted, we got six minutes to get you people into place. We'rejust wondering what the hang-up is. Ted, we gonna do this? [Baby Crying] [Rollie] We need you guys out of the airlock. Ted, you copy? - Surgeon? - His blood pressure's off the chart. You're not doing too well either. No one is. - Okay. Mintz? - Evram? Are you near the airlock? Uh, no. In the truss corridor with Paula. - [Foreign Language] - The hallucinations, um- - [Cries] - We can't move. Copy that. Don't try. [Sobbing] In five minutes, we go live to the world, people. Five minutes! L- I need to see them in their places. - What's wrong with Daddy? - Nothing, honey. - Daddy's fine. - He looks scared. Hey, buddy. I know you're going through something there. But, uh, where you at? Talk to me. Come on, Ted. Look at us. [Mike] Continue the launch sequence now. - Ted, we can't leave them here. - You're damn right we can't. Sharon? Walker? Come on. Push. You and Donner thought they were close enough. You thought they had a chance. They were less than a hundred meters away. That's less than a football field. And Goss ordered you to launch. [Sighs] You know, we all have moments we regret. But you don't need to feel guilty. My clearance allows complete access to the archives. I've gone through the cockpit tapes, the telemetrics... the readings from Sharon and Walker's suits. I'm the detail lady, Ted... and I'm here to tell you definitively, they were not gonna make it. ##[Disco On Speakers] [Laughing] Hey, excuse me. You know, it's gonna be a lot less festive tomorrow morning. I'm having fun, Donner. FOAD. FOAD. FOAD. FOAD. [Whispering] - Thought you didn't swear. - Oh, I swear. I swear. I thought you didn't date astronauts. [Laughs] I'm thirsty. ##[Continues] - Tequila, Tommy. - No. Tommy, belay that. - Two-Two large waters. - I told you to FOAD. Look, I'm just here with Nadia because we had- I don't care. Donner, I don't care. You do whatever you like with your rules. You watch your sixes with vapor trails over there, okay? I know he may seem really charming... but he's kind of a legend for scamming on pretty-drunk ASCANS... - and you're pretty drunk. - Watch my sixes? What? You're-You're my wingman now? You're looking out for me? Let me tell you something, Mr. Hot Shot Been to Mars Tragic American Hero. I don't need a wingman. I can look after myself, okay? - I belong in this program. - Yeah, I know you do. I told you that. I have sacrificed for this program. - I got that. - Really? Do you have that, Donner? Mr. I Have Rules. 'Cause I don't think you have a clue. I don't think- You know what? You never will. You-You will never know what I gave up for this program. - This is all yours now. - You're kind of making a little bit of a scene now. Oh, oh, oh! Tequila, Tommy! Hey, maybe we should go grab a bite, get some air. No. - You know-You know- [Laughs] I never- - Take her home. You expect everyone, me especially- - [Vomiting] - All right. Come on. I got her. You stay here. [Vomiting] [Jen] Donner, get out. Why am I always sick around you? Our relationship is built on vomit. [Retching] I think I should be the one to help them get home. [Baby Crying] [Baby Crying] Zoe. Zoe, come on. We gotta get going here. - [Crying Continues] - Do you copy? What the hell is going on with all of you? - Ted, look at me. - [Jen] We can do this, Donner. It's now or never. We have to go. Donner, we need to focus here. Two minutes to air, people. Two minutes! - [Jen] It's time to go. Donner. - [David] Where's my Canadarm? - [Jen] Ted. - Nadia, I need to see the banner. - [Jen] Ted. - [David] Nadia! [Wass] Um, she's not doing so good, David. She says she keeps seeing someone in the hatchway. [Jen] Come on, Ted. Look at us. Please, Ted. Come on. We can't lose those funds. Do it for Roy. Do it for science. Please copy. [Thunderclap] Ten billion dollars, Ted. Come on. Do you copy? - Somebody's got to call it. - We can do this, Donner. No. No, Sharon. Please. [Baby Crying] Please. We can do this, Donner. No. No, we can't. Flight, we're aborting. Copy? Copy that, Donner. We are aborting. Get everyone back on the ship. Unbelievable. Ten billion dollars. [Sighs] That's gonna take a real bite. We might as well just abandon the science altogether. I'm sorry, you guys. I'm sorry if I let you down. My son probably saw everything, right? It wasn'tjust you, Ted. It was all of us. - Is anybody still hallucinating? - I'm okay. I am a little bit, but it's fine. - I'm good to go here. - So am I. This is one screwed-up Halloween. I trust you are as embarrassed as I am disappointed. I won't belabor the point. Expect to hear from our attorneys. The only embarrassment I suffered... was watching astronauts carry candy buckets into space. As for the rest, my man made the right call. - Hope you feel that way in the morning. - Count on it. Hey, maybe next time, fellas. Mahalo, Mike. Much aloha. - Is it over? - Their vitals are starting to normalize. It's over, but nothing's to say it won't happen again. So, Roy, is your mom gonna take you trick-or-treating? Daddy didn't. [Maddux Narrating] There's a reason no one likes to show fear. It's taken as a sign of weakness- a festering wound. Being vulnerable leads to being dinner in a Darwinian world. It's okay. We'll finish. But there's also the risk ofhubris... of not knowing your own limits. - [Cries] - And that may be the biggest danger of all. What I wanted to say today in the cafeteria wasn't about sandwiches. What I meant to say was... that you made the right decision. So you must never look back or feel regret. Because your path is in space. You know that. Your soul was meant to soar. Even I know that. The baby's soul- it was meant to move on... to another body... another path... independent of you but not forgotten. So you must not feel guilt... because, you see... there is freedom for both of you. That must bring you some joy. How is he? Um, he's confused, a little shaken up. - Scared. - A weakness he learned from his father. His father is the most brave man I know. - Is he going trick-or-treating? - No. Not with the others. - As I was saying. - Mm-mmm. - But I think- - [Roy] Trick or treat. He will come out all right in the end. [Roy] Trick or treat. [Maddux Narrating] There's a fine line between bravery and stupidity. Thank you. - If you want the bag of candy- - Trick or treat. Sometimes it makes more sense to show a little weakness... and ask for help. - Donner? - Yeah. Thanks for today. One of us could have been killed. I guess. I may not be expressing it, but I'm really glad you're up here. Likewise. I mean that. If I tell you something, will you promise not to make fun of me... or think that I'm crazy? I mean it. This is- This is between you and me. Yeah. Sure. I've been having this dream. And I don't know why, but it really scares me. In the dream, I am, um- I'm pregnant. - You're pregnant? - Yeah. I'm pregnant up here... and floating naked through here, into the airlock. - I look out the pane, and I see you- - You see me. And I'm outside. I'm working on a thruster. And there's a really bright light emerging from behind a planet? Yeah. Okay. Uh- I've been having that same dream for, like, two months. What happened today- these hallucinations, the dream- this has nothing to do with the HALOs, does it? No. Mmm. Ahh. English - US - SDH
