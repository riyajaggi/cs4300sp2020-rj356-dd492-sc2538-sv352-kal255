TODAY WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT BOOK SAFETY. WHEN READING A POP-UP BOOK, IT'S ALWAYS BEST TO TAKE THE PROPER PRECAUTIONS: GOGGLES, HELMET, WATER WINGS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT POP-UP BOOKS ARE THE REASON YOU SHOULD NEVER READ OVER SOMEONE'S SHOULDER. WHATCHA READIN', SCARE- OWWWW! THAT HURT SO MU-UNGH! (PAINED GROAN) I DON'T KNOW WHO INVENTED THE POP-UP BOOK, BUT I BET THEY'RE EVIL. PURE EVIL.
