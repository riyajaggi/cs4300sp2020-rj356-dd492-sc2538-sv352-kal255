 you can tell from the girl that the corresponding ad company sent over. She's an intern. If you were really a famous person, could they have sent over someone like that? Think about that yourself. So what if I'm an intern? - This is our script for today. You've seen this. - I've seen it. - We will film in this order today. - Okay. So, the filming time might be a bit long. You'll need to coordinate with the actor. - Okay?   - No problem. Don't worry, Director. The actor is ready! - Director. - Very handsome. Right, Mo Mo. Photocopy a script for the actor. Okay! I'll tell you about what we're going to film next. First, you're acting as a very skilled hacker. Because you're busy with hacking computers every day, you have a large workload and you don't have enough stamina so your mental condition isn't very good. But after you drink the Chao Wei orange juice, you immediately became filled with strength and hacked the alien computer right away. You've prevented a large scale attack on Earth from space, saving the entire human race. "I'm... so... bored." "I'm so bored?" The target has been reached. Don't throw your rubbish carelessly. Be careful with hygiene. Okay! Hey, hey! Don't sit there! - Sorry, sorry! - It's fine. Thankfully, I had a jacket on. Why can't I sit there? You can't sit on the cases for equipment. This is a rule in the business. - Be careful from now on. - Did you want to make an example of yourself, so that everyone knows that you're an intern? I-It's my first time doing this. I didn't know. Sit here and eat. Or you can sit on the floor, too. Nobody cares. Thank you, thank you. Why don't you eat in your room? I don't want to see that old witch, Linda. I'm on a diet. You're dieting? Aren't you afraid of getting blown away by the wind? I'm not the same as you guys. My face is going to be zoomed in on a big screen. - For thousands and millions of people to look at and discuss. - Oh. What did that "oh" mean? Are you making fun of me? I ate too much. I was just burping. Three, two, one. Action! Chao Wei orange juice replenishing your daily– Whose phone is that? Sorry, Director, it's mine. Sorry, sorry, Director! Oh my! [Dance practice] What are you doing? I'm working. What about you? What are you doing? I'm thinking about you. Is that too corny? I'm thinking if your work needs my help. How could you help me? Isn't that too indirect? Did you forget to bring anything? I can bring it over to you. What can I tell him to bring over? There is an envelope on my table. Bring it over for me. [Please bring this to my future husband for him to sign. Personally from Lin Zhicun's wife] I'm at the doorway. Wait for me. We can take a break after we finish filming this scene. There's no rush. Take your time. Hello. I am the artist management director, Linda, from Shuang Jie Films. Are you interested in becoming an artist? No. That's fine. You can consider it again. You can look up our company on the internet first before you give me an answer. There's no need. Situ Mo! Have you been waiting long? I haven't. No one's looking for me. Then I'm going to rest awhile more. I woke up too early this morning. What's wrong with your shoulder? It's sore. I'll massage it for you then. Stay like this. Sleep for ten minutes. ♫  A little bit of feelings  ♫ ♫  A little bit of intensity  ♫ ♫  Even an ordinary life changes  ♫ ♫  Even an ordinary life changes  ♫ ♫  As if taken over by gentleness, the story trembles  with fate ♫ ♫ Gathering the courage to make a promise ♫ ♫ I want to walk farther with you, this is all of my thoughts ♫ ♫ Let’s create the most touching scene together ♫ ♫ I want to walk farther with you, no matter how this  world changes ♫ ♫ At least this pair of hands are going to hold tightly  to each other ♫ ♫ Let the length of a love song witness our love forever ♫ Hello, Sister Linda? Where are you? Come to the dressing room now.  Okay, okay! They're looking for me. Be careful when you go home. I'm heading back. What's wrong? The jacket's too small. How can he wear it? I prepared it according to what you'd asked for. Look over here. There is no other style here. Can it be altered? There's no time. Did you see if any of the employee's clothes can be borrowed? The employees' clothes are too low class. He can't wear that. Ah, I got it! Please wait a moment. I forgot to give this to you. This isn't important. Take off your jacket. - What? - Take off your jacket. Why is this jacket so plain? There's no design element to it at all. Gu Weiyi looks so nice in it. It's okay, right? - I think this– - I think it's fine. Let's hurry and film. After we finish, let's quickly leave. Okay? I'm going to the restroom. Order a coffee for me, too: a cappuccino. This is weather is too cold. That... Can I borrow your jacket? - Take it. - Thanks. Mr. Lin, the set is ready. Are you cold? Put this on quickly. I'm going to go earn money. You have to behave yourself. Don't fight with the other kids. I'm going! Three, two, one. Action! Chao Wei orange juice replenishes everything that you need in a day. Calcium, iron, zinc, selenium, and vitamins all in one bottle. Cut! This isn't bad. Play it back. What's that in your pocket? Director, how about we do it again. Let's redo it. Let's redo it. Quickly! Come, come. Let's redo it! Don't lose time. Action! Chao Wei orange juice replenishes everything that you need in a day. Calcium, iron, zinc, selenium, and vitamins all in one bottle. Cut! Okay! Pack up! - Everyone has worked hard!   - Director, you've worked hard. - Give me a copy of all of the materials used today.   - Okay, Director. You've worked hard, you've worked hard. Wait a moment for me, I'll get your jacket for you. "Please bring this to my future husband." "Personally from Lin Zhicun's wife." That.. My coworker was just playing around. Don't mind it. The angle of these photos are not great. Don't I look better in person? - Give it to me. - What are you doing? Didn't you want a signature? It's fine, actually. My coworker was just... playing... I'm telling you, don't be too touched. My tears are falling like rain. - Mr. Lin, change out your clothes. - Okay. Just give me the jacket. Wait a moment. I just borrowed your jacket for filming. Let's swap them out. Give this to me, I'll take it to him. Wait a moment! Here. - You've worked hard today. - You did, too. I say... A little intern like you is quite hardworking. Thank you. We're going to be working together for a long time. Be prepared. Don't sit on the filming equipment box again, okay? Okay, okay. Sorry. How about this? Let's add each other on WeChat. Okay. You can scan my code. "Super-duper handsome" is me. Okay, I'm leaving then. You've worked hard. Bye-bye. Let's go! What's wrong? Are you not leaving? Let's go. Where are we going? - A date. - A date! Why did you bring me here? Are we shopping? The internet says that people usually come here for dates. Is that not right? It's right. I just thought that you would bring me to places like the library or the science museum. Do you want to go? What do you think? Then let's go. Come! I haven't shopped in a long time! Let's go. Let's go! Come, come! ♫ Holding your hand, step by step by step by step,  circling around you ♫ ♫ Feeling this love, bit by bit by bit, becoming clearer ♫ ♫ Grateful to have met you, I’m even smiling in my sleep ♫ ♫ Just like this, it makes my heart skip a beat ♫ ♫ Letting sweetness, day by day by day by day, slowly  fermenting ♫ ♫ Baking the taste of romance ♫ ♫ This level of sweetness is just right, I want to eat it  in one bite ♫ ♫ One serving of the bread of love tastes like two  servings of happiness ♫ Does it taste good?

Throw me another one! Thank you! - Throw it, throw it!   - This child is yours now. Where did you get this child? - Let's go.   - I– I'll give this back to you. Thank you! Gu Weiyi! It's illegal to kidnap kids! Child, what's your name? Xiao Jie. Tell me secretly... Do you know that guy? I do. You two actually know each other? Then tell me! How did the two of you meet? Tell me. Go in. Go play. Go play. Be careful! Where do you want to stick this? On my back! Done? - Okay. - I'll stick it on for you. Where do you want to stick it? Stick it on your face! Mom and dad, be aware that your child has gone inside. Child's dad, he's calling you. Go inside! Hello, Lu Lu, where are you? Ah Ke and I are lining up for lunch. What is it? I want to eat with you. Go and eat with Fu Pei, so that you can reconcile with him. I was about to tell you, Fu Pei– It's our turn, it's our turn. Let's go. You guys go ahead then. Niu Niu! What? Talk with me. No, I'm on my final round. Da Pang! Da Pang! Yeah, yeah. Someone is hiding 60 degrees from the East. Behind the tree stump. Go, go, go! Go to that side. Go. [Situ Mo] Can I come and talk with you? If it wasn't to post this on my feed, who would play basketball under this bright sun? How coldhearted. She's still not coming to find me. Is she going to die if she apologizes first? I'm coming down! - Let's go. - Didn't I tell you to look after Xiao Jie? All the other kids come down on their own. I got down on my own, too. It's pretty fun. Go up and slide. Let's go, let's go.

You liar! Is it fun? There's something even more fun. Children, bury him! Where's the young lady? I didn't see her. Let's go together. Let's go. She's there. Go ahead. Gu Weiyi! Gu Weiyi! Gu Weiyi! What are you looking at? Printing photos. It's free. What photo do you want to print? You'll know soon. It's out. Isn't he cute? Is he cute? Not cute. You've got no taste. My Situ Ding Dang is so cute. Let's print a photo of us. Did we... take a picture together? We didn't. We didn't. Look in your phone. Did we? See, we didn't. Look. We didn't. Can I talk with you? Of course. What's wrong? Oh, right! We took a selfie at the seaside! Oh, right! This is mine. Go and print another one for yourself. I won't. So prideful. You won't even print a free picture. My Situ Ding Dang looks just like me. So cute, so cute! I'll put it in my wallet. Mister, there are a lot of side dishes in our store. If you sit like this, you might be a bit squished. It's fine. Okay. Go ahead and order. - One serving of pork belly. - Okay. - King oyster mushroom.   - Okay. Also, rice in seaweed. You can order what you want. - One serving of grilled chili peppers.   - Okay. - And a salad.   - Okay. Order what you want. A fruit salad. Okay. As well as a serving of wakame. - That's all. - Okay. You're not going to order? That'll be enough. Please bring them out quickly. Okay. How about let's try to chat? About what? Let's play a game. Paper, scissors, rock. Whoever loses will eat the chili. I don't want to play. You're afraid of losing, aren't you? - Rock, paper... - Scissors! Admit to your defeat. Eat the chili. Eat it. Two out of three rounds. Fine then. Rock, paper, scissors! - Eat it. - Three out of five rounds. Are you sure? You're not going to say "Four wins in seven rounds," right? I'm sure. Rock, paper, scissors! Rock, paper, scissors! I feel a bit of pity for you now. Eat it. Eat it. I don't eat spicy things. I know. I really don't eat spicy. Fine. Then, do your best to act cute. I don't know how to. Then, we'll have to do things as we promised. Eat it. Wait. [How do I make my girlfriend happy by acting cute?] I don't want to eat it. Okay. There was no sincerity. I don't want to eat it. It's still missing that little bit. I don't want to eat it! Gu Weiyi, you– The meat is about to get burned. So cold. How about this? Are you still cold? Not anymore. What is it? It's warmer like this. Let's hurry and go home. Go home and do what? Let's watch a horror movie under a blanket. Blanket? Why do we have to be under a blanket? Then let's drink alcohol. You can drink, I won't drink. I've always been the one drinking. Alcohol doesn't work on you. Why doesn't alcohol work on me? What do you mean, Gu Weiyi? Why doesn't alcohol work on me? It's too cold. Let's go home. What did you mean? Explain yourself! What did you mean? Explain. I really think that we can take the blanket to the living room. We can take the blanket to the living room, but you can't drink. Shan Shan, why are you here? Have some water. Am I... disturbing you guys? No, no. How about we talk in my room? Let's go. When is she leaving? Mo Mo... I'm telling Fu Pei to come and pick her up. What is it? Do you guys want to have some water? No, thanks. I really think that if we continue like this, there will be no outcome. Fu Pei is usually loud and straightforward. But when we argue, he ignores me. I'm a girl, I can't go to him first. Right? What do I do? Mo Mo, think of something for me. - Are you guys going to shower? - I– I've already showered at school. - It's so dusty on the way, shower again. - Mo Mo... What? Nothing. Continue, continue. What do I do? I've even passed by the basketball courts on the way today. I thought that I saw him. But I was hallucinating. Oh, that's not right. [To be continued, there are easter eggs...] Give me a ball! Throw one to me. Throw it. Do you want to play? I-I'm just curious. I've never been inside. Then let's go inside. How? We're not kids or parents. Wait for me. If you want to go in, then let's go. Grandma has money. I can bring him in to play. My girlfriend wants to play but we don't have a child, so we can't get in. Where's your girlfriend? Look over there. There are so many people. Which one is your girlfriend? The one who looks pretty when she smiles. Why should I trust you? Look. It's the same person, right? Auntie, this is my wallet. All of my identity documents are inside. Do you believe me now? Xiao Jie, do you want to go? Go then. Thank you. Have fun!
