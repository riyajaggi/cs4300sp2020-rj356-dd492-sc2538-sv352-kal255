 [Teacher Xu: Students, the College English Test Band 4 and Band 6 marks have been released; remember to check them.] Professor Jiang, he's playing with his phone and not focusing on his experiment in class. You can play with your phone, too. I-- What are you laughing about? I–I didn't laugh. I didn't laugh. We're on break right now. You're stricter than I am. The CET Band 4 and 6 marks have been released. Didn't you take the exam, too? The results are out? I won't look. All right. Everyone, let's have a five-minute break. Everyone, check your results. I got 639 points. What about you? 671 points?! You cheated! - Hello?  - Have you finished the competition? Come and play some games. The girl from last time... Did you know she was in the same dorm as Situ Mo? When you come back, ask Mo Mo what that girl likes for me. I want to give her a present. Mo Mo won't pick up my calls anymore. What? What happened with you and Situ Mo? Hello? Fu Pei? Hello? This is the advertisement company in my dreams. Hello, Director Li. We have an appointment with your finance department. Okay, please wait a moment. Hello? Director Li from the Pu Hua company is here. Please wait for a moment. - Here.  - For me? Thank you. The best employee of every month will be made into lollipops. Why? Because our company worships the true "Kneel and Lick God."  (T/N: kiss up to your superiors or people better than you) Director Li, please come with me. This way, please. [Lina] [Sasa] [ORI Advertising] According to the meeting, clean up their sales payment method. - After you're done, bring it to the meeting room.   - Okay. How's it going, Little Jing? I'm working. What are you designing? A rabbit's butt. - A rabbit's butt?   - Yeah. This is someone's movie logo, you're making it into a rabbit's butt? It's so cute. What do you know? Look! What is this? What is this? There's even fur on it! Doesn't your rabbit have fur? I want to look at butts. Hello, Mom? Where are you? I'm at a company that I was sent to. What food delivery company? (T/N: she mistakenly heard wai mai (food delivery) instead of wai pai (outside company)) - I'm busy working. Talk to you later. I'm hanging up.  - Hey, hey, hey. I'm on the way to where you're living. I'm nearly there. Why are you coming? Can't I come to visit you? Invite your Auntie Xu's child, Little Gu, for dinner tonight. Mom, why don't you ever listen to me? I told you to tell me if you were coming. Why did you suddenly come? Why didn't you tell me? You don't respect– I'm going to stop here. Don't invite him to dinner or I'm going to get angry. I'm hanging up. Oh my! It's so pretty here. Let's sit there. Let's sit here. There's a spot. Here. Have a look. Order whatever you want to eat. Order. Oh! It's so advanced now. I don't even know how to use it. It's really easy. I'll teach you. No need. As long as your dad knows, it's fine. Why are you being so lovey-dovey? Hello, your dishes are here. Please enjoy. Thank you. Thank you. You're welcome. Eat. You ordered so much, are we going to finish it? I told you to invite Little Gu, but you didn't want to. I can finish it. Why do you want to invite him? You child, it's because of you. You've stayed at their house for so long. I came to visit. Shouldn't I go visit him and invite him for dinner? There's no need. He's busy. It's as if you two are close. Mom! Okay, don't be like this. I've discussed it with your Auntie Xu. - Later when Little Gu goes home, let's go home as well.   - What home? Of course, it's yours and Little Gu's home. I've told you that I'm going to move out. Why are you going back there? You're going to move out just because you said so? Have I agreed to it? Moreover, didn't you transfer to another company now? If you're getting transferred back and forth, why are you moving houses? Forget it. Everything should begin on a safe and steady step. Are you rest assured by the fact that I'm living with a man? I... That's why I've come to observe. Auntie, have some tea. - Be careful, it's hot.   - Thank you. It's good tea. Little Gu, our Mo Mo has brought trouble to you during this time. It's all thanks to you for taking such good care of her. If it wasn't because something happened at home, I would have come to visit you ages ago. Thank you, Auntie, for coming especially to visit me. Actually, I've held you when you were younger. I've heard this from my mom. You even peed all over me at the time. Say, time passes so quickly. In a blink of an eye, you're so grown up now. - Do you have a girlfriend?   - No. Then... Then, you should be careful with your decision. Okay. I heard from your mom, you're an exceptional student. You've had scholarships since you were young. But don't work too hard on your studies, too. Okay, Auntie. Studies are important, but you can't let it hinder your personal matters. About getting a girlfriend, you should also take it as a daily matter. Okay. You're laughing? What are you laughing about? Have you got a boyfriend yet? You only know how to laugh. Actually, the two of you could– Mom! Don't speak nonsense. What have I said? I'm not giving you two pressure. I was just saying. - I was just saying.   - Okay. How tall and how much do you weigh? 1.87m, 65kg. (T/N: 6'1, 143lbs) 6–6–65kg is...? 130 jin.  (T/N: 1 jin = 500g; roughly 143 pounds) That's way too thin! You need to eat more. Oh right, right! I brought some walnuts that we grew at home. These things are especially good. They're good for your brain. Thank you, Auntie. How about this? I'll make a walnut black sesame porridge. As a scientist, you should eat more. Also, the ones Auntie makes are especially tasty! Mom! Where did the black sesame come from? It's so late, don't make it now. Let's go. Look! I've brought the black sesame here with me. Also, it's really quick. Do you want to try my culinary skills? I don't want to trouble Auntie. It's not troublesome. It's not troublesome. Or... Or do you think that I'm nosy and actually don't want to eat it? No, no. Auntie, I really want to eat it. That's great then! How about this? Help me open the walnuts and take the meat out. I'm going to fry up the sesame first. What are you doing? [Late Night Dishes] - Drink some!   - I've eaten. We were waiting for you. - Eat this. Eat this.   - All right, all right. Does your girlfriend want a drink? She's not my girlfriend. She's not drinking. I'm drinking. I really don't want to like you anymore. You drank too much. Nonsense! What is our relationship? What should friends do? Hey, hello. One beef fried noodles; take out. - Okay. Find somewhere to sit and wait a moment.   - Okay, thanks. - Let's add an order of cold noodles, okay?   - All right. - Do you want some?   - No. - Then just one order will be fine.   - Okay. - Your fried noodles.   - Thanks. Come. Come. Okay. - Sorry.   - Are you blind?! What are you doing?! Pay up! - Sorry!   - Pay the medical bill! - Pay for the clothes washing!   - Sorry! - Forget it.   - Forget it? Do you know how much this is? You can't pay for it! You pay. You pay! - Sorry.   - Is there any use in saying sorry? I just want you to pay. Pay up! I'll pay. Can you pay? Do you know how much this is? Do you know how much this is? - Pay him and pay his bill as well.   - ¥3,800 ($540)! You have money, is that right? You have money? Do you know who I am? - Forget it, forget it.   - Exactly, don't fight with a young person. Do you know?! Come with me. - Where are you going?   - Forget it! It's fine now. Thanks for today. How much was it? I'll pay you back. No need. No need. Why were you drinking alone today? I didn't pass my CET Band 4. I was feeling a bit upset. No way. You still haven't passed it? We're about to graduate and you still haven't passed? Yes. You just didn't pass CET Band 4. Is there a need for a man like you to get himself drunk? Yes. I feel so upset! Then, work harder and take it again. What use is there in just being upset? There are no more chances. I'll help you, as thanks for helping me get out of trouble this time. Mo Mo didn't tell you that I'm a scholar-tyrant (top student)? Mo Mo... Okay. What are you doing? Opening walnuts. You're opening walnuts like this? You're using too much force. I'll open one for you. It's going to be made into a porridge anyway. It doesn't matter if it's a little bit smashed. Let me see! Let me see! Look at this! To celebrate, let's eat it. Okay. It tastes good. Do you remember the amount of force you just used? Continue. The size isn't right. I'll find one for you. This one is better. Mom, what are you doing? I... I just wanted to see what you two were doing. We're opening walnuts. Opening walnuts like this? How interesting. How else are we supposed to open them? Here. Look at me. Here, here. Give me a walnut. This walnut. This one. When we were young, we opened walnuts like this. There's a trick to it. Look, like this. Isn't there a gap in the walnut? Push it in there. Look. How is it? Didn't the walnut open just like that? Right? Who would crack it open with the door? The door is going to break. You're brilliant. Here, here! You open them. - What?   - Open them. Okay, okay. All right. Here you go. The two of you can practice slowly. Practice. I need to go check on my sesame. How about you try it out? I don't have keys. Keys. - Try my culinary skills.   - Thank you. Thank you, Auntie. Here, here. Quickly. Hey, stop playing. - I'm going to wait a bit to drink it.  - Why? It's better if we all drink it together. Our Little Gu is so understanding. Hurry and eat it. Stop playing. Hurry up. Try it. How is it? It tastes too good. I feel a bit tired. Mo Mo, clean up these bowls later and wash them. I'm going to the room to sleep. Okay. Mom, Mom, Mom! Where are you going to sleep? In your room, of course. Mom, Mom, Mom! Little Gu, you won't mind if I stay here for a night. Right? I don't mind. Auntie, rest well. Look at that. Mom, Mom, Mom! Don't make trouble. I'll book a hotel room. Let's stay outside. Let's not go outside today. I'm tired. I'm just going to stay here for a night. I'll leave tomorrow, okay? - Seriously.  - Mom. Mom! I'm really too tired today. Sorry. It's fine. Mo Mo, wake up. Mo Mo, time to get up. You're going to be late. No! No! - Then are you not eating breakfast?   - Not eating. Wake up! You're going to be late. I won't be late. My alarm hasn't gone off yet! Wake up! Hurry up! - No!   - Get up! You say, this child... Seriously. You're about to be late for work. - No way. Get up. Get up!   - Mom! Ten more minutes! Just ten more minutes! Talk about you, you child. You sleep just like a pig. Rolling left and right. When I wake you up, you yell as if I'm killing a pig. - Quickly get up!  - Kill me! Kill me now! Lower your voice. I'll beat you if you wake up Little Gu. Mom... - Quickly, get up!   - No! Hurry up! I'll come back again in ten minutes. You're awake? Let's have breakfast. Good morning, Auntie. You're awake. Our dear guest, would you like you to try our fresh soybean soup, with salty sticks made of Spanish olive oil, or porridge with Chinese century eggs with minced meat in wheat buns? What? She's asking whether you want soy milk and fried dough sticks or century egg porridge with minced meat and buns. Porridge and buns will do. I want the soy milk and fried dough sticks! Hurry up and get it then. Are you waiting for someone to serve you? Sit down. Bring the porridge for Little Gu over, too. Okay. All right. Let's dig in. Behave yourself. And don't dunk it in the soy milk. It's— I like it like this. You weirdo. You learn so fast. You weirdo. You weirdo. Okay, hurry up and eat. Senior Sister, have you completed the experiment? I've finally done it. Gu Weiyi, do you have a pen? Senior Sister, I have a pen. - Give it to me.   - But I need it for myself. Nonsense. I wish I could go back to university. I hate working. All those digits and calculations are wrecking my brain. Eat more walnuts. Auntie said it's good for your brain. Oh right, walnuts! My mom asked me to give a bag to you. She said you need to develop your brain as well. She asked for you to eat more and get smarter. Senior Sister. Thank you. Gu Weiyi, be more professional. How could you bring walnuts to the lab? Senior Sister, have some walnuts. Then I want some, too. Eating walnuts isn't professional. You're so stingy. Food is not allowed in the lab. Then, why did you bring walnuts to the lab? What are you guys doing? Who brought the walnuts? "The best way to open walnuts." Stop everything and stand up. Have I been giving you guys too much freedom? How can you have such a careless attitude towards an experiment? Although I'm usually joking around with you guys, I'm always serious in every experiment we do. I hope you will do the same as well. Don't you know that food is not allowed in the lab? All of you, your attitude today and this kind of behavior disappoints me too much. I'm sorry, Professor. Listen carefully. I hope my students are always serious and focused on research. Okay? All right. I want you to do today's experiments from start to end again. Yes, Professor. Hello. This is HR's budget. - Are you the new intern in Ah Qing's department?   - Yes. - You haven't graduated yet?  - Not yet. Look at this recruitment advertisement. [RECRUITING REAL ADVERTISERS] If I put this advertisement in your university, would it attract you? It can. [RECRUITING REAL ADVERTISERS] Religion. [Study Questions] Let's take a break. I've been studying for 2 hours. I'm suffering from mental blocks now. Let's go find Mo Mo. So, you know that you've studied for only 2 hours? How many times have you mentioned to go out and have fun in these two hours? I don't want to study anymore! Lower your voice. If you can spell the 40 words I just told you to learn, I'll take you to Mo Mo. Okay. Mom, I'm home. You're back. Look at you! Behave yourself. You should behave more like a girl. If Little Gu sees you, he'll lose interest. Who cares if he's interested or not. Little Gu, you're back. Hello, Auntie. Are you hungry? Not really. Chop-chop, hurry up. Put the clothes away and fold them nicely. You came back so late, how can you not be hungry? Auntie will cook for you right now. Mo Mo, hurry up and come out to wash the vegetables for me. Actually, Mo Mo is quite hardworking and good at doing chores. No! Well... You can help me with the vegetables then. - What a lazy girl.   - Okay. You shouldn't wash it like that. You're wasting water. How about this? Go and dice the carrots for me. Go. What should the size of the cubes be? About 1 cm. It's obvious you've never done chores. Mo Mo, come out and help us! How many people do you need just for cooking a dish? Gu Weiyi, are you serious? - What?   - Are you joking? I wanted to be a bit more careful. Should I bring a microscope for you? What do you know? He's a scientist. He has his own logic. You have to be more respectful towards the country's future pillar. Nothing. You're cutting well! You're cutting well! Keep cutting. Continue. It's quite good. Quite good. Continue cutting. Are you near-sighted? - About -1.00.   - Then, why do you usually not wear glasses? When I wear glasses while looking down a microscope, it can refract light. It also affects what I see in the field of view. Oh. You seem to really like physics. If I didn't, why would I choose it? Here, here! Take a break and have some fruit. - Here, here. Have some fruit.   - Thank you, Auntie. Here. You have some, too. You youngsters can't always stay at home and not go out. How about this? Come. I'll take you guys out. Let's go and experience the healthy and happy lifestyle of an elder. Okay? Go where? You don't need to worry about where we're going. Just follow me. Come, come! Don't always read books. It's bad for your eyes. - Come! Get up!   - I'm not going. Get up! Hurry! Let's go. Shuffle. How did your mom know that there was this kind of place in the area? Middle-aged women have this kind of radar in them. I can't explain it to you. But I really don't know how to play. It's fine, I'll teach you. Draw your tiles. Young man, do you know how to play? I... do. It's okay, it's okay. Take it slow. Pong.  (T/N: a set of three identical tiles) Eight sticks.  (T/N: "ba-tiao" in the bamboo suit) Pong! - Pong!   - Kong. (T/N: a complete set of four identical tiles) - Six sticks.   - Kong. Nine sticks. I win. East wind. I win. I win. Pay up. Pay up, pay up. How about I do it? Let me do it. Let me do it. It's fine. I get it now. Okay. I win. I win. I win. Concealed Kong. Kong with flowers. Pay up, pay up, pay up! Quick! Pay up. Pay up! I'm not playing! I'm not playing! Seriously. My luck is so bad today. I'm not playing anymore. Wow. How awesome. Young man, you're so amazing. He's a scientist. You guys play depending on your luck. He plays with his mind. The young man is so awesome! Nice one! - Amazing, amazing.   - Smart, smart. He's not an easy one. Here. All for you. Wow, so much! - Be careful.   - Mom, be careful. Your money bag! You keep it! Leaving her things everywhere. She speaks so loudly. Did you see my book? No. Here, here, here. Have some sesame porridge. Are you hungry? Here. Eat it up. - Mom, where did the sesame porridge come from?   - It's leftover from yesterday. Can't we eat something that's not leftover? Don't always sit on the floor. The floor is cold. Get up. Up, up. Sit on the sofa. That... Here, Little Gu, get up. Where did my magazine go? Sit over that way. I remembered that I put it... put it where? Where did I put the magazine? That... - It's here.   - Mom! What? N–Nothing. You're freaking out over nothing. You two are so in sync. If people didn't know, they'd think you guys have been living together for tens of years. [To be continued, there are easter eggs...] Get up! This won't do! Get up! I don't want to get up! You say, this child... Seriously. You're about to be late for work. No! Get up! Mom! Ten minutes! Ten minutes! You child. Little Gu, are you awake? He must be having a nightmare. He looks so elegant even when he's having a nightmare. Our Mo Mo should really learn from him. Look at how he's sleeping. - Mo Mo.   - Auntie. I'm awake. You're awake. Did I wake you up?
