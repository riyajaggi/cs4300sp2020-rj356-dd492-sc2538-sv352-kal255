 JUST BELOW THE ARCTIC CIRCLE, IN CANADA'S NORTHWEST TERRITORIES, HERE ON GREAT SLAVE LAKE, A COLONY OF PIONEERS HAVE CHOSEN TO LIVE OFF THE GRID... I GOT YOU. I GOT YOU. ...AND ON THE EDGE. THE FREAKING THING JUST BREAKS, AND THERE'S NOTHING I COULD HAVE DONE TO PREVENT THAT. THE REASON I LIKE IT UP HERE IS THE FREEDOM. NOBODY TELLS ME WHAT TO DO, HOW TO LIVE MY LIFE. I WOULDN'T HAVE IT ANY OTHER WAY.

 BUT LIVING ON A SUBARCTIC LAKE DURING THE WORST WINTER ON RECORD PUSHES THEIR FLOATING HOMES TO THE LIMIT. IT'S -45 DEGREES. THE COLD CAN KILL YOU. NUMBER-ONE THING, THE LIFE-SAVING THING, IS YOU NEED HEAT. THE HOUSE IS FROZEN. IF I CAN'T GET THIS HOUSE HEATED UP, ALL OF MY SYSTEMS ARE GONNA BE AFFECTED. IN A LAND WHERE NOTHING COMES EASY... EVERYTHING IN THIS LIFESTYLE TAKES EFFORT. IT'S -45 OUTSIDE, AND ANYTHING MECHANICAL WON'T START.

 THIS FAR NORTH, YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE ALL YOUR EQUIPMENT IS IN TIP-TOP SHAPE. YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT. ...THESE REBELS USE EVERY RESOURCE. YEAH! TO SURVIVE, THEY HAVE TO DIG DEEP AND BATTLE THE WRATH OF GREAT SLAVE LAKE. I CAN BARELY FEEL MY FINGERS RIGHT NOW. IT'S JUST COLD. IT'S JUST REALLY, REALLY COLD. ONE OF THE MOST SAVAGE WINTERS EVER TO HIT THE NORTHWEST TERRITORIES IS CHARGING ACROSS THE FROZEN HORIZON OF GREAT SLAVE LAKE. WITH ONLY FOUR HOURS OF SUNLIGHT A DAY TO WARM THIS TUNDRA, THE FORECAST FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS IS NOW CALLING FOR RECORD LOWS OF -50. WELL, YOU HAVE TO MAKE A REAL VALIANT EFFORT TO PREPARE FOR THE ONSLAUGHT OF WINTER. I'VE BEEN UP HERE FOR ALMOST 30 YEARS, AND THIS IS ONE OF THE COLDEST. IT'S SO **** COLD. HOUSEBOATERS STEPHAN HERVIEUX AND HIS FIANCéE, ALLYCE RATTRAY, HAD SET OUT FOR A FISHING EXPEDITION ON THE OPEN LAKE. BUT SEVERE WEATHER FORCED THEM BACK HOME. THE LAKE IS UNPREDICTABLE. YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GONNA GET. EVERY 20 MINUTES, IT CHANGES, SO IT'S DANGEROUS, BUT IT'S PART OF LIVING ON THE LAKE. YOU CAN'T BE OUT THERE IN A STORM, GALE WINDS. I MEAN, NOBODY'S FISHING IN THAT. WHOA. WHAT NOW? COLD IN HERE. FOR PETE'S SAKE! I WALK IN. IT'S LIKE -10 DEGREES. YEP. SOMETHING'S NOT WORKING. GEEZ LOUISE. THE HOUSE IS FROZEN. YOU'RE KIDDING ME. I LOOK TO THE PROPANE FURNACE. NOT A THING. IF I CAN'T GET THIS HOUSE HEATED UP, PIPES ARE GONNA BURST, MY ELECTRICAL SYSTEM'S GONNA GO, MY BATTERIES ARE GONNA FREEZE. HOLY **** LOOK AT THIS. FREAKIN' FROST ALL OVER THE DAMN HEATER UNIT. EVERY SYSTEM IN MY HOUSE IS THREATENED AT THIS POINT. THE HEATER UNIT SHOULD NOT BE FROZEN. I START MESSING AROUND WITH THE PROPANE. I CAN'T GET A PILOT TO LIGHT. I TURN IT OFF, DO A RESET. NOTHING. THAT PILOT LIGHT GOING OUT NEVER HAPPENS. IT'S JUST TOO COLD. SOMETIMES THE PILOT WON'T EVEN LIGHT, SO WHAT YOU DO IS YOU KEEP THE TORCH ON THAT THERMAL COUPLING, AND I WAIT TILL IT'S RED-HOT. TURN THE THERMOSTAT UP TO... YOU CAN'T COOK FOOD, 'CAUSE THAT'S ALL ON PROPANE. THE HOT WATER'S ALL ON PROPANE. TO GET HOME TO A COLD HOUSE, PIPES ARE MOST LIKELY FROZEN SOLID. WE WEREN'T PLANNING FOR THIS. WE DIDN'T EMPTY THEM OUT. ALL OF OUR CANNED GOODS, ALL OF OUR FOOD IS NOW FROZEN, EVERYTHING. TURN THE THERMOSTAT UP TO 100% PLEASE. YEAH, IT'S THERE. PROPANE GELS AT -37, -40. GUARANTEED THE PROPANE HAS GELLED. WE'VE HAD THAT. IN EXTREME COLD, PROPANE GAS CHANGES TO A LIQUID, MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO FLOW THROUGH THE HEATING SYSTEM'S HOSES. I'LL GO CHECK AND MAKE SURE ALL THE LINES ARE STILL GOOD. I GOT TO GO OUTSIDE, AND IT'S -45 DEGREES OUT THERE. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. OKAY. THE SUN'S GOING DOWN, AND THE WIND'S PICKING UP. AND THE FORECASTING ONE OF THE COLDEST NIGHTS OF THE YEAR. I GOT TO GET THIS FIXED. THIS IS WHAT IT IS LIVING OUT HERE. AT THIS TEMPERATURE, NOTHING WORKS. SO IT'S JUST SCRAMBLING TO GET IT GOING, AND YOU CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT HEAT. MAN, IT'S COLD. CAN YOU SEE THIS? AND THERE WE GO. IT'S SO COLD RIGHT NOW THAT I JUST MOVED THE HOSE AND IT SNAPPED. I'M SCREWED. I NEED TO FIND ANOTHER HOSE LIKE THIS. I GOT THESE HOSES. I HOPE THIS WORKS. FIXING THE PROPANE FURNACE WILL SAVE HIS HOUSEBOAT'S UTILITY SYSTEMS. IN THE MEANTIME, A SMALL WOOD STOVE WILL HAVE TO KEEP HIM AND ALLYCE WARM. IN THE WINTER, THE CONTINUOUSLY BREAKING DOWN OF EQUIPMENT NEVER ENDS. OKAY. IT'S ABOUT 3:30, AND I'M RUNNING OUT OF LIGHT FAST. WITHIN THE NEXT HOUR, IT'S GONNA BE PITCH-BLACK. HOURS OUTSIDE YELLOWKNIFE BAY, VETERAN FISHERMAN BRIAN ABBOT AND HIS ASSISTANT SHEILA FRISE HEAD TO THEIR FISHING OUTPOST TO SEEK SHELTER FROM THE SEVERE COLD FRONT HEADING THEIR WAY. MADE HER. THE WEATHER IS THE WORST IN 33 YEARS. YOU STILL GOT TO GET OUT THERE AND PULL THESE NETS ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. WE NEED MORE FISH IN THE FREEZERS. BUT YOU GOT TO PLAY IT SAFE. BACK TO THE ICE PALACE. IT'S A SAFE PLACE TO GO. WE CAN KEEP EQUIPMENT, EXTRA NETS, FUEL, FOOD, AND JUST ANYTHING YOU MIGHT NEED FOR SURVIVAL IF YOU DO GET STUCK OUT HER. COLD OUT THERE. COLD SKI-DOO RIDE. I'VE BEEN FISHING ON THIS LAKE SINCE I WAS 12 YEARS OLD, AND THIS IS THE COLDEST CONDITIONS I'VE EVER FISHED IN. THERE'S ZUCCHINIS IN THE FRIDGE. YOU STILL GOT TO COOK THAT UP, FRY IT. YEAH, I'LL JUST FRY IT UP IN THE FRYING PAN. BRIAN DOESN'T CARE WHAT KIND OF WEATHER WORKS IN. HE'LL GO DAY OR NIGHT, IT DON'T MATTER. WELL, I SURE HOPE THIS WINTER'S A LITTLE BIT BETTER THAN THE LAST WINTER. CAN'T STAND ANOTHER ONE LIKE LAST WINTER, BUT I HEARD IT'S GONNA BE A BAD ONE THIS YEAR. THIS FORCED BREAKAWAY FROM THEIR FISHING LINES MAY BE NECESSARY, BUT IT WILL BE COSTLY. THERE'S QUITE A BIT OF ICE OUT THERE STILL, 'CAUSE WHEN I PUT THAT HOOK DOWN TO GRAB THE ROPE, THERE WAS PRACTICALLY LIKE ONLY THIS MUCH OF IT STICKING OUT. AND IT'S ONLY GONNA GET A LOT WORSE. THERE'S A LIMIT YOU HAVE TO LEAVE YOUR NETS DOWN. FISH DON'T WAIT. THE NETS ARE OUT THERE. FISH GOES BAD. AND SO I ACTUALLY TRY TO PULL MINE IN 24 HOURS OR LESS. YOU LOSE EVEN LESS FISH, AND WHAT YOU'VE GOT ARE MORE LIVELY. AND IF YOU'RE IN A GOOD SPOT, THE NETS ARE FULL ENOUGH ANYWAY. AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GET MORE NETS IN RIGHT AWAY, TOO. WE DON'T HAVE ANYWHERE NEAR ENOUGH FISH. I MEAN, THIS, WHAT WE GOT HERE, IS NOT GONNA CUT IT. YEAH, WE NEED TO GET THEM FREEZERS FULL TO THE BRIM. YEAH, WE GOT LIKE SEVEN FREEZERS TO FILL. NINE. NINE NOW? THERE'S NINE NOW, YEAH. MY GOODNESS. YEP. ACROSS THE BAY, GREAT SLAVE LAKE'S NEWEST RESIDENT PREPARES TO HUNKER DOWN FOR HER FIRST NIGHT IN THE SAVAGE WEATHER. IT'S GETTING REALLY COLD, SO I HOPE IT GOES OKAY. IT'S GONNA BE A BIT OF A TEST. I'M MOLLY. I'M 21. I WAS BORN IN YELLOWKNIFE AND RAISED ON A HOUSEBOAT. I'VE BEEN IN VANCOUVER FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS, AND NOW I'M MOVING BACK TO YELLOWKNIFE TO LIVE ON MY OWN. I KNOW HOW TO, LIKE, CHOP FIREWOOD, AND I CAN CANOE. BUT THERE'S LOTS OF THINGS THAT I'VE NEVER HAD TO DO BEFORE BECAUSE I WAS YOUNGER AND MY FAMILY TOOK CARE OF ME. BUT NOW I WANT TO LEARN HOW TO DO IT MYSELF. MOLLY HAS MOVED INTO HER NAMESAKE HOUSEBOAT, THE MOLLY BARGE, BUILT BY HER DAD 20 YEARS AGO. SHE'S RETURNING TO HELP HER FATHER RUN HIS FLOATING B&B.; MY DAD CALLED ME, AND HE ASKED IF I COULD HELP HIM WITH THE CAFé AND THE HOUSEBOAT. SO I MOVED UP BECAUSE THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT NORTH, AND IT'S ALWAYS NICE TO COME HOME. THE HOUSEBOATS, THEY'RE COMPLETELY SELF-SUFFICIENT AND OFF THE GRID. THERE'S NO POWER LINE GOING UNDERNEATH THE ICE. SOME PEOPLE HAVE PROPANE HEAT, WOOD HEAT. SO IT'S ALWAYS A BIT OF AN ADAPTATION, BUT, YOU KNOW, IT FEELS KIND OF NATURAL. THAT'S THE WAY I WAS RAISED. WITH TEMPERATURES CONTINUING TO PLUMMET, FOR YOUNG MOLLY, HEAT IS HER NUMBER-ONE PRIORITY. I'M PRETTY PROUD OF MYSELF. I GOT MY FIRE DONE. MAKE SURE THAT I CAN GET ALL MY BEDDING HERE. I GOT A LOT OF STUFF I GOT TO GET DONE. MAYBE AUGER FOR ICE, TOO... AUGER THE ICE FOR WATER. SO THERE'S LOTS OF STUFF I GOT BEFORE MY NIGHT'S OVER. WHILE MAINLANDERS CAN JUST TURN ON THE KITCHEN TAP, RUSTLING WATER FROM GREAT SLAVE LAKE IS FAR MORE CHALLENGING. MOLLY MUST USE AN AUGER, A LARGE HAND-POWERED DRILL, TO TAP THE LAKE'S WATER FROM UNDER FIVE FEET OF WINTER ICE. WHEN I WAS TRYING TO AUGER FOR WATER, I KICKED AT IT, AND, LIKE, MY FOOT MADE MORE OF A DENT IN THE ICE. THIS IS NOT GOING ANYWHERE. THIS IS NOT HAPPENING. 35 MILES WEST, "PIKE" MIKE AND RAGNAR WESSTROM, HARDENED VETERANS OF GREAT SLAVE LAKE WINTERS, KNOW ALL TO WELL THE SEVERITY THESE DEEP FREEZES HAVE ON VITAL EQUIPMENT. YOU GOT A FLASHLIGHT THERE, MIKE? YEAH, YOU WANT TO BORROW IT? YEAH, PLEASE. THE COLDEST NIGHT OF THE YEAR IS TAKING A TOLL ON HIS $100,000 ALL-TERRAIN VEHICLE. WHEN YOU HAVE -50, NOTHING IS MOVING. YOU HAVE TO HEAT UP EITHER THE OIL OR EITHER THE COOLANT. WE HAD TO OPEN UP THE VALVES TO THE COOLANT TO THE ENGINE, AND EVERYTHING IS SO, SO COMPLICATED. TURN THE VALVE ON. I'LL IGNITE IT FOR YOU. IT'S ON. SO, THERE'S THIS AUXILIARY HEATER TO HEAT UP THE COOLANT. YOU USE IT WITH A PROPANE TORCH. AND YOU HEAT UP THE ENGINE, AND YOU CAN START IT. RAGNAR IS HEATING UP THE HAGGLUNDS' COOLANT, WHICH ACTUALLY WARMS UP THE ENGINE'S OIL AND TRANSMISSION FLUID SO IT CAN START UP IN THE BITTER COLD. AFTER THAWING THE ENGINE'S COOLING SYSTEM FOR OVER AN HOUR, RAGNAR ATTEMPTS TO START THE HAGGLUNDS. NOW HE HAS TO KEEP THIS MACHINE RUNNING FOR AS LONG AS HE CAN TO PREVENT THE ENGINE BLOCK FROM FREEZING. 35 MILES EAST, BACK IN THE BAY, THE COLDEST NIGHT OF THE YEAR IS THREATENING STEPHAN AND ALLYCE'S HOUSEBOAT. I CAN BARELY FEEL MY FINGERS RIGHT NOW. IT'S JUST COLD. IT'S JUST REALLY, REALLY COLD. STEPHAN'S OLD PROPANE HOSE CRACKED FROM THE SUB-40-DEGREE TEMPERATURE. NOW HE'S ATTACHING A NEW HOSE TO RESTORE HEAT IN HIS HOUSEBOAT. I WANT THIS PROPANE UNIT TO WORK. I CAN SLEEP THROUGH THE NIGHT. ALL RIGHT, LORD. IF YOU'RE LISTENING... BABY JESUS. NOW I GOT TO PUT THAT UNIT ONTO THE HOUSE. DON'T WANT TO BEND THIS... TOO MUCH. **** THIS IS A BIT TRICKY. MAN, I DO NOT LOVE THIS WEATHER. AND THERE WE GO. I JUST BROKE THE SECOND ONE. IF I CAN'T GET THIS HOUSE HEATED UP, THAT FREEZE COULD DESTROY OUR HOUSEBOAT. AS A RECORD 40-DEGREE-BELOW-ZERO SUBARCTIC CHILL GRIPS THE 10,000 SQUARE MILES OF GREAT SLAVE LAKE... MAN, I DO NOT LOVE THIS WEATHER. AND THERE WE GO. I JUST BROKE THE SECOND ONE. THE BITTER COLD HAS SNAPPED BOTH OF STEPHAN'S PROPANE HOSES. HE IS RUNNING OUT OF OPTIONS TO SURVIVE THE NIGHT. IT'S GETTING LATE, AND THERE'S NO WAY I CAN FIND ANOTHER HOSE RIGHT NOW. BUT I'VE GOT TO MAKE DUE WITH WHAT I HAVE. WELL, NO CHOICE, HON. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO SLEEP BACK HERE. WE GOT TO CONSERVE SPACE. LESS PLACE, MORE HEAT. WE'VE GOT A FIRE STARTED, BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO KEEP THE ENTIRE HOUSEBOAT WARM. SO WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IS REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF SPACE WE'RE TRYING TO HEAT. IF WE GOT THAT TABLECLOTH, PUT IT UP RIGHT HERE. JUST TO BLOCK THAT AREA? WELL, YEAH, TO KEEP THE HEAT IN, RIGHT? HERE YOU GO. THERE ARE SO MANY PROBLEMS OUT THERE IN THE WINTER. EVERYTHING CAN GO WRONG. BUT THE NUMBER-ONE THING, THE LIFE-SAVING THING, IS YOU NEED HEAT. YOU DON'T HAVE HEAT, YOU CAN'T SURVIVE LIVING OUT HERE ON THE LAKE. TRY AND USE THE OLD HOLE. IF NOT, WE'LL MAKE A NEW ONE. I DON'T CARE. OKAY. HEAT IS OF THE ESSENCE HERE. HIGHER. AW, HOLD ON. **** WE'RE GONNA HEAT OUR AREA FIRST. HOPEFULLY, THAT'LL KEEP THE PIPES FROM FREEZING AND THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM FROM SHORTING OUT. IF WE CAN'T, THAT COULD BE THE END OF OUR HOUSEBOAT. 35 MILES WEST, RAGNAR WESSTROM KEEPS THE ENGINES OF HIS HAGGLUNDS RUNNING TO PREVENT THE SEVERE TEMPERATURES FROM DAMAGING HIS $100,000 MACHINE. INSIDE, HE'S PLANNING AN IMPORTANT MISSION WITH CHEF RON THAT WILL AFFECT ALL OF THE RESIDENTS ON GREAT SLAVE LAKE. WEST 114. SO THAT TAKES HIM RIGHT HERE AT BAKER ISLAND. WE'RE LOCATED IN UNCHARTED WATERS IN THE NORTH ARM OF THE GREAT SLAVE LAKE, AND NOW THE GOVERNMENT HAS DECIDED TO MAP THE AREA. THEY WANT TO COME TO MY LODGE TO PUT UP A GPS TO MAP THE WHOLE AREA. I THOUGH, "**** THIS IS NOT GOOD." I BUILT THIS PLACE FROM SCRATCH, AND THIS IS MY LITTLE KINGDOM. I TOLD THEM, "KEEP OF MY ISLAND. I'LL PUT UP THE **** GPS MYSELF." RAGNAR STARTED HIS LODGE OFF THE GRID TO GET AS FAR AWAY FROM THE GOVERNMENT AS POSSIBLE. BUT HELPING MAP OUT THE UNCHARTED LAKE WILL ULTIMATELY BENEFIT HIS BUSINESS. I HELP THEM MAP THIS PLACE, AND IN EXCHANGE, THEY PROMISE ME ACCESS TO THOSE MAPS, AND THAT GIVES ME MORE SAFELY TRAVEL IN THE LAND WITH NEW CLIENTS TO NEW TERRITORIES FOR HUNTING AND FISHING. IT'LL ALSO BE SAFER BECAUSE WE HAVE A PINPOINT LOCATION, EVERYTHING. OKAY, YOU CAN TAKE THE GREEN ONE. I'LL TAKE THE BLACK ONE. OKAY. BACK IN THE BAY, HIS HOUSEBOAT'S VITAL SYSTEMS IN JEOPARDY OF BEING PERMANENTLY DAMAGED FROM THE EXTREME COLD, STEPHAN DECIDES TO VISIT FELLOW HOUSEBOATER GARY VAILLANCOURT. I REALLY HOPE YOU GOT SOMETHING FOR ME, GARY. I KNEW I HAD TO FIND SOME SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM, AND THE ONLY PERSON I COULD THINK OF WAS GARY. GARY WAS THE FIRST HOUSEBOATER, WAY BACK IN THE '70s. IF ANYBODY'S GOT THE PROPANE HOSE I NEED, IT'S GONNA BE GARY. WHAT EXACTLY IS IT YOU NEED TO GET ON IT? A PROPANE HOSE FOR A TWIN-STAGE REGULATOR. IF YOU'VE GOT ONE, I COULD REALLY USE ONE. WITHOUT IT, I GOT... YEAH, I GOT ONE IN HERE SOMEWHERE. I'M SORT OF KNOWN AS A COLLECTOR OF THINGS, AND I'VE BEEN HERE A LONG TIME, SO I'VE GOT A LOT OF THINGS. I ACQUIRED A SURVEYOR FOR A CONTRACT I WAS WORKING ON TO CLEAN UP OLD, CONTAMINATED MINE SITES ON GREAT SLAVE LAKE, AND IT'S JUST A BIG STORAGE PLACE NOW. ONE OF THE THINGS ABOUT BEING ON THE LAKE IS, WE'RE ALL NEIGHBORS, SO WE'RE ALL IN THE SAME BOAT. IF THERE'S A PROBLEM, WE GOT TO HELP EACH OTHER OUT. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. LET'S TRY THIS ONE. YEAH, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS, BUT... NOW, THAT'S LOOKING PROMISING. THAT'S LOOKS A LOT LIKE... THAT'S ALMOST... NO, THAT'S NOT IT. THAT'S NOT IT. THAT'S IT! THAT'S EXACTLY... THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I NEED! YOU'RE KIDDING? NO, I SWEAR TO GOD. WOW. PERFECT. COOL, MAN. THANK YOU, GARY. THANK YOU, GARY. ALL RIGHT. PUT THAT HOSE ON, AND HOPEFULLY THAT FURNACE KICKS IN. ACROSS THE BAY, MOLLY'S RETURN TO GREAT SLAVE LAKE TO LIVE ON HER OWN AND OFF THE GRID IS PROVING MORE DIFFICULT THAN SHE REMEMBERED. I WAS NOT SO SUCCESSFUL, AND THAT WAS REALLY DISCOURAGING. NOT BEING ABLE TO GET A HOLE IN THE WATER, I GOT A POT, AND I MADE SOME SNOW WATER. AND THAT'S JUST HOW IT HAD TO BE BECAUSE THAT WAS NOT GOING ANYWHERE. IT WAS REALLY DISCOURAGING. LIVING OFF THE GRID ON GREAT SLAVE LAKE AFFORDS CERTAIN FREEDOMS, BUT WINTERS HERE CAN BE MORE THAN MANY NEWCOMERS ARE PREPARED FOR. IT SURE IS DIFFERENT THAN BEING IN VANCOUVER. I DO LOVE BEING BACK, AND THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THE NORTH, BUT EVERYTHING IN THIS LIFESTYLE TAKES EFFORT. ONE OF THE NICE THINGS ABOUT LIVING UP HERE IS IT'S MORE YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF. I MEAN, I GOT TO START THE GENERATOR, WHICH I HAVEN'T DONE. I GOT TO START THE PROPANE, WHICH I HAVEN'T DONE. I GOT TO START THE WATER, WHICH I HAVEN'T DONE. SO IT'S LIKE DRINKING OUT OF A POT. SO IT'S DIFFERENT. IT'S DEFINITELY MORE CHALLENGING TO BE HERE, AND I'M FIGURING OUT WHAT THAT'S LIKE TONIGHT. ARMED WITH A NEW HOSE FROM GARY, STEPHAN IS NOW IN A RACE AGAINST TIME TO GET HIS HEATER WORKING BEFORE THE NIGHT'S FALLING TEMPERATURES CAUSE VITAL SYSTEMS ON HIS HOUSEBOAT TO BREAK DOWN. I GOT ANOTHER HOSE FROM GARY, THANK GOODNESS. SO NOW I JUST GOT TO PUT SOME TEFLON TO MAKE SURE WE GOT A GOOD SEAL. WE FOUND A PROPANE HOSE, AND I REALLY, REALLY HOPE THIS IS ALL I NEED TO GET THAT HEAT RESTORED. THE HOUSE IS OBVIOUSLY FROZEN SOLID RIGHT NOW, AND I NEED THE HEAT A.S.A.P., LIKE, YESTERDAY. I GET THE FITTINGS ON PERFECTLY TIGHT. YEAH! THAT'S WHAT I WANT. ALL RIGHT, EVERYTHING SEEMS GOOD. NOW FOR THE MOMENT OF TRUTH, SEE IF THE FURNACE STARTS. - HON? - YEAH. I JUST GOT A HOSE FROM GARY. GREAT. AND INSTALLED IT. EVERYTHING SEEMS TO BE OKAY. ALL RIGHT, PILOT ON. COME ON. VALVE TURNED. GOOD TO GO. OKAY, THIS HAS TO WORK. I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE I CAN DO, HON. HEAT THAT THERMAL COUPLE. COME ON. LET'S SEE IF THE THERMAL COUPLE WILL HOLD. **** AND LOOK AT THE WIND. LOOK AT THE WIND BLOWING MY **** COLD WIND IS BLOWING MY FREAKIN' TORCH OUT. NO WONDER IT DOESN'T WANT TO START. PLEASE, PLEASE. DARKNESS CONTINUES TO BLANKET THE VAST EXPANSE OF GREAT SLAVE LAKE. AND ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL WINTER COLD SNAPS ON RECORD HAS BROKEN STEPHAN'S HOUSEBOAT FURNACE. THE HOUSE IS OBVIOUSLY FROZEN SOLID RIGHT NOW, AND I NEED THE HEAT A.S.A.P. THE COLD CAN KILL YOU, AND EVERY SYSTEM IN MY HOUSE IS THREATENED AT THIS POINT. NOW FOR THE MOMENT OF TRUTH, SEE IF THE FURNACE STARTS. OKAY, THIS HAS TO WORK. I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE I CAN DO, HON. COME ON. WITHOUT HEAT, THEIR WATER PIPES, BATTERY BANKS, AND ELECTRICAL PANELS CAN BECOME PERMANENTLY DAMAGED BY THE -50 DEGREE TEMPERATURES. PLEASE, PLEASE. YEAH! FLAME ON! GOOD, GOOD, GOOD, GOOD. RIGHT ON! FINALLY! FINALLY! THANK GOD. LET ME CLOSER TO THAT HEAT! YEAH. NO, THAT'S... THAT'S THROWING OFF SOME HEAT NOW. GOOD. GOOD. SEE, HON, I TOLD YOU I'D FIX IT. GOOD JOB, BABE. SOMETIMES, I SERIOUSLY THINK THE LAKE IS TRYING TO KILL ME. BUT WHEN ALLYCE AND I CAN PUT OUR HEADS TOGETHER AND SOLVE A PROBLEM LIKE THIS, THERE'S NO OTHER PLACE I'D RATHER CALL HOME. AS DAWN BREAKS ACROSS THE BAY, FISHERMAN BRIAN AND HIS ASSISTANT SHEILA RETURN FROM THE OPEN LAKE WITH A LOAD OF FRESH FISH. THE COLD FRONT HAD FORCED THEM TO SEEK SHELTER INDOORS, LOSING TIME SETTING MORE CRITICAL NETS. MY HANDS ARE COLD. BY THE TIME THE FISHERMEN RETURN, THE FRESH FISH ARE FROZEN SOLID... NO, THOSE ONES ARE FROZEN, THOUGH. ...MAKING THE FILLETING PROCESS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE. THIS WAS PROBABLY THE HARDEST JOB THAT I'VE EVER DONE IN MY WHOLE LIFE. WHEN YOU'VE GOT A WIND WHISTLING, YOUR FISH ARE FREEZING SO QUICKLY, IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. ONE POSSIBLE SOLUTION NOW COULD BE THE CANADIAN BOMBARDIER, MADE FOR THESE TERRAINS, WHEN IT'S WORKING. THE BOMBARDIER IS BASICALLY LIKE A LARGE VAN AND THROWING A SET OF TRACKS ONTO IT AND THROWING THE FRONT WHEELS AWAY AND PUT A COUPLE SKIS ON IT. HAVING A BOMBARDIER OUT ON THE ICE IS REALLY IMPORTANT. YOU'VE GOT SOMEWHERE WARM TO CLIMB INTO WHEN YOU'RE FREEZING YOUR BUTT OFF. YOU'VE GOT SOMEWHERE TO DRY GLOVES OFF, THINGS LIKE THAT. AND IT KEEPS THE FISH FROM FREEZING. I'M GONNA HAVE TO START WORKING ON THIS BOMBARDIER. IT'S A NECESSITY. 35 MILES WEST, ALONG THE UPPER SHORES OF THE LAKE... RAGNAR WESSTROM HEADS OUT ON HIS MISSION TO INSTALL A TRANSMITTER TO SCAN THE TERRAIN SURROUNDING HIS LODGE. THE GOVERNMENT APPROACHED ME ABOUT THIS SATELLITE MAPPING PROGRAM. THEY WANT TO SEND THEIR OWN PEOPLE OUT. DIDN'T REALLY FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH THAT, SO I OFFERED THEM A DEAL THAT WE DO IT FOR THEM. RAGNAR HEADS OUT ACROSS THE FROZEN LAKE TOWARDS THE GPS WAY POINT, THE HIGHEST POINT IN THE REGION. WE'RE ABOUT 15 MILES FROM THE HIGHWAY, AND WE'RE ABOUT 60 KILOMETERS FROM YELLOWKNIFE, SO WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE. GREAT SLAVE LAKE IS A BIG-ASS LAKE, 300 MILES LONG, AND THE WHOLE NORTH ARM IS ABOUT 100 KILOMETERS LONG. AND WE'RE THE ONLY LODGE IN THE NORTH ARM, SO WE'RE QUITE ISOLATED. THIS AREA IS ONE OF THE FEW PLACES IN THE WORLD THAT'S UNCHARTED. WHEN I FIRST HEARD THE GOVERNMENT COMING IN TO DO THE SURVEY FOR THE NEW MAPS, I DIDN'T REALLY FEEL COMFORTABLE ABOUT IT. BUT AFTER SOME THOUGHT, I THOUGHT I COULD BENEFIT FROM IT. BETTER SAFETY, EXPANDING THE BUSINESS. SO AFTER ALL, I THOUGHT IT'D BE BETTER FOR US. RIGHT ON. HAGGLUNDS BV206... UNSTOPPABLE. THERE'S CHALLENGES LIVING THIS FAR NORTH. YOU DON'T HAVE ANY ROAD ACCESS. YOU DON'T HAVE ANY CORNER STORES. YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING. BUT WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT, IT'S WORTHWHILE BECAUSE YOU'RE FREE. AND THERE'S NO PRICE ON FREEDOM. WE JUST GOT THIS TRANSMITTER GPS YESTERDAY FROM OTTAWA. IT HAS THE TRANSMITTER, IT HAS A LITHIUM HEAVY-DUTY BATTERY, AND ALSO THE ANTENNA. WHEN I CONNECT THE TRANSMITTER, IT WILL CONNECT WITH THE SATELLITE, AND THEN I'LL BE ABLE TO MAP THE AREA. AND THIS HAS NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE. ONCE ACTIVATED, THIS NEW GPS BEACON WILL HELP PROVIDE IN-DEPTH CHARTS DETAILING THE UNDERWATER TERRAIN OF GREAT SLAVE LAKE, WHICH WILL MAKE IT SAFER FOR BOATERS AND EASIER FOR ANGLERS TO LOCATE FISH. NOW I'M SECURING THE DEVICE WITH ROCKS SO THE WIND DOESN'T TAKE IT WHEN WE GET THIS BIG STORM. GOOD. FIRMLY SECURED. MISSION ACCOMPLISHED. IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS, WE GET GOOD CHARTS OF THE TERRAIN. WITH NEW MAPS, IT'LL ALSO BE SAFER, BECAUSE THE GUIDES CAN, VIA RADIO CONTACT, PINPOINT LOCATION, EVERYTHING. SO IT'S SAFER FOR US, SAFER FOR THE CLIENTS. IF WE DON'T HAVE THAT, IT COULD BE A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH. ACROSS THE BAY... ...STEPHAN TRAVELS TO HENRY AND BRIAN'S FISH PLANT IN SEARCH OF MATERIALS TO BUILD A SHELTER IF HE AND ALLYCE ATTEMPT TO FISH THE OPEN LAKE AGAIN. GOOD DAY, GOOD DAY, HENRY. HOW'S IT GOING? BUSY MAN. BUSY MAN. BUSY MAN, YEAH. JUST CUTTING FISH ALL DAY LONG, AS YOU SEE. HOW'S BUSINESS? PICKING UP DAILY. GOOD. I'M SETTING UP A FISH CAMP MYSELF. NOT COMPETITION. YOU KNOW I'LL NEVER COMPETE. COME ON. I'M SMALL FRIES. I'M SMALL FRIES. I'M GETTING MARRIED, AND I NEED THE MONEY. SO THIS IS LIKE EXTRA INCOME. I GOT TO GET SOMETHING, RIGHT? SO I'VE GOT A BASE OUT THERE, BUT I NEED A TARP. I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU OR BRIAN MIGHT HAVE ONE. WELL, THERE'S A BUNCH OF STUFF DOWN THERE IN THE BACK DOWN THERE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S DOWN THERE ALTOGETHER, BUT WE CAN TAKE A LOOK AND SEE. YOU DON'T MIND? NO, DON'T MIND. AWESOME. THANKS. YEP. I HAVE THIS OLD TARP HERE. IS IT ANY GOOD TO YOU? IT'S GOT A FEW HOLES IN IT, BY THE LOOKS OF IT. WHAT ABOUT BACK THERE? I GOT THIS BIG TARP HERE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS IS. LOOKS LIKE A TARP. YEAH, THERE'S ON HERE. NO, NO. HOLD ON. THIS IS A PROSPECTORS TENT. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I NEED, HENRY. I GOT REAL LUCKY. I WAS LOOKING FOR A TARP AT HENRY'S, AND I FOUND A NICE PROSPECTOR TENT. WELL, YOU CAN BORROW IT. I DON'T WANT TO BORROW IT. I WANT TO OWN THIS. WHAT CAN I... I HAVEN'T GOT ANY MONEY. BUT YOU KNOW ME... I'M PRETTY HANDY. WE GOT AN OLD BOMBARDIER OUT HERE. WE NEED TO GET IT SHOVELED OUT AND CLEANED UP SO WE CAN GET WORKING ON IT. THE BOMBARDIER? YEAH. I'D LOVE TO FIX THAT UP FOR YOU. DOWN THIS WAY HERE. I'LL SHOW YOU WERE IT'S AT. THIS IS HOUSEBOAT ECONOMICS 101. THEY GOT WHAT I NEED. I GOT WHAT THEY NEED. THEY GOT A BOMBARDIER. I GOT A BRAIN AND A WRENCH. WE'RE GONNA MAKE SOMETHING WORK HERE. WE COME TOGETHER, WE EXCHANGE. WE'RE COMMUNITY MEN. THERE SHE IS OUT THERE, IS THE BOMBARDIER. SHE'S AN OLD BOMBARDIER. GOOD OLD SNOWCAT? YEAH. TWO YEARS AGO, IT WAS RUNNING FINE WHEN WE PARKED IT THERE. SO IT WAS RUNNING WHEN YOU PARKED IT. IT WAS RUNNING WHEN WE PARKED IT, YES. IT'S A '74. IT'S A '74? THAT'S A GREAT YEAR. YEAH. YEAH. THIS THING WAS MADE IN '74, TOO. WAS IT? YEAH. BEST YEAR. BEST YEAR, IF I DO SAY SO MYSELF. YEAH. THAT'S A BEAUTY. HOW AM I GONNA GET THIS **** THING STARTED? AND I HAVE NO CLUE WHAT TO DO. WE'LL GET THAT THING RUNNING, HENRY. DON'T YOU WORRY. BACK IN YELLOWKNIFE BAY, AT THE CT BARGE, GARY VAILLANCOURT RUNS A B&B; ABOARD HIS MASSIVE VESSEL. THE COLD FRONT FORCED HIM TO BURN THROUGH ALL OF HIS PROPANE JUST TO KEEP ALL SYSTEMS RUNNING. NOW GARY AND MOLLY MUST REPLACE THE TANKS BEFORE TEMPERATURES PLUMMET AGAIN TONIGHT. THE MAIN THING I WORRY ABOUT WITH THIS RESTAURANT IS PROPANE. WE USE PROPANE HERE FOR EVERYTHING. HEAT, OF COURSE, REFRIGERATION, COOKING, AND OUR GAS LIGHTS WHEN WE NEED THEM. I JUST HAPPENED TO BE WALKING BY, AND I SAW THE GAUGES, AND I REALIZED WE WERE MINUTES FROM LOSING THE WHOLE HOUSE, AND THAT'S A BIG DEAL. WHEN THE ICE GETS BAD, YOU CAN'T MOVE PROPANE, AND IF I RUN OUT THEN, I AM REALLY UP THE CREEK. THIS IS LIKE A LEVER. THESE MULTIPLE PULLEYS, THEY MAKE YOU STRONGER THAN YOU ARE. YOU CAN LIFT MORE THAN YOU COULD. I'VE NEVER LOADED PROPANE WITH MY DAD BEFORE, SO I NEVER REALLY KNEW HOW WE GOT IT ONTO THE HOUSEBOAT. SEE HOW FAR YOU CAN GET. WILL YOU BRACE IT SO IT'S NOT JUST GONNA DROP ON ME? YOU'RE READY TO BE DONE DOING PROPANE. I DIDN'T REALLY REALIZE HOW HEAVY IT WAS GONNA BE 'CAUSE IT'S ABOUT 70 POUNDS FOR THE PROPANE TANK. IT'S STUCK ON THE THING. LET HER DOWN. OKAY. WIGGLE IT OUT. THAT'S GOOD. RIGHT THERE. STOP, STOP, STOP! YOU CAN GET IT. "I WANT TO BE THE BEST I CAN"... THAT'S HER ATTITUDE, AND I'M REALLY PROUD OF HER. AND SHE HAS A FEW MORE TOOLS IN THE KIT NOW. ONLY EIGHT MORE. HA, HA, HA. DON'T THINK LIKE THAT. LAST EIGHT! ACROSS THE BAY, AT BRIAN AND HENRY'S FISH BARGE, STEPHAN IS CHARGED WITH THE TASK OF BRINGING A 40-YEAR-OLD BOMBARDIER BACK TO LIFE. GOOD OLD SNOWCAT? YEAH. TWO YEARS AGO, IT WAS RUNNING FINE. I WANTED TO PROVE MYSELF TO BRIAN. I WANT TO SHOW HIM THAT HE CAN DEPEND ON ME, NOT JUST AS A NEIGHBOR OR AS A FRIEND, BUT AS AN APPRENTICE. AND LOOKING AT THAT BOMBARDIER THAT HASN'T MOVED IN 2½ YEARS, IF I CAN MOVE THAT THING, I THINK HE JUST MIGHT SEEM SOME VALUE IN ME. IF HE SUCCEEDS, HE'LL GAIN A PROSPECTORS TENT IN TRADE AND HELP PROVIDE A MUCH-NEEDED MOBILE SHELTER FOR THE FISHERMEN. I'M DEALING WITH A 1974 BOMBARDIER. COME ON. YOU DIRTY, LITTLE... SUCKA. YEAH, IT'S HARD WORK, AND IT'S A HARD LIFE. BUT IT'S A VERY REWARDING LIFE. I'M OUT HERE ON THE LAND, FRESH AIR, HELPING OUT MY NEIGHBOR, HELPING OUT MY FRIEND. I'M NOT PAYING TAXES. I'M NOT A SLAVE TO A DESK. I'M NOT A DESK MONKEY. I AM FREE. WHAT I'M DOING IS NOT UNLIKE WHAT THE DENE DO WITH THE HIDE OF AN ANIMAL. THEY WILL CHEW IT TO MAKE IT MORE MALLEABLE. THIS HOSE IS COLD. IT'S FREEZING OUT HERE, OBVIOUSLY. AND SO, I'M GETTING SOME HEAT ON IT. ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO. LOOK AT THAT FIT. THAT WAS AWESOME. THAT IS MUSIC TO MY EARS. TRYING TO FIX A 1974 BOMBARDIER FROZEN IN THE ICE ON A FREEZING-COLD LAKE WITH MISMATCHED TOOLS, SOME BORROWED, SOME FOUND... I MEAN, THIS IS TOUGH. ALL YOU CAN DO IS TRY AND THEN TRY AGAIN. WORKING WITH COLD STEEL IS NEVER FUN. AND MOST OF THE YEAR, IT'S COLD HERE. SEE WHAT I GOT TO WORK WITH? OKAY, LET'S SEE IF WE GOT POWER. MAN. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A 1974 BOMBARDIER. ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN. PLEASE. BRIAN AND HENRY ARE DEPENDING ON ME. IF I DON'T GET THIS THING STARTED, THEY WILL BE VERY DISAPPOINTED. THE MOMENT OF TRUTH. YEAH! I GOT IT! WAY TO GO, MAN. YOU DONE A GOOD JOB. GOOD GIRL! GOOD GIRL! THAT'S WHAT I WANTED, BABY! OKAY. HOPEFULLY, SHE GOES IN GEAR, AND SHE ROLLS. THE TRACK IS TOTALLY FROZEN. JUST LIKE A TRUCK WHEN YOU GET IT STUCK, I'M JUST GONNA GO FORWARD, BACK, FORWARD, BACK. NO. THIS WINTER ON GREAT SLAVE LAKE HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY BRUTAL, ONE OF THE COLDEST ON RECORD. IT'S HERE THAT GARY VAILLANCOURT AND HIS DAUGHTER MOLLY ARE RUNNING AN OFF-THE-GRID BED-AND-BREAKFAST. THE RECENT COLD SNAP ALMOST DEPLETED HIM OF HIS PROPANE, HIS ONLY SOURCE OF ENERGY. I'M GONNA DO THE DISHES. NOW THEY'RE PLAYING CATCH-UP TO GET THEIR DINER BACK UP AND RUNNING BEFORE CUSTOMERS ARRIVE. THE POWER SYSTEM AND THE WATER SYSTEM THAT I HAVE ARE BUILT FOR ABOUT SEVEN PEOPLE, SO RUNNING A RESTAURANT IS CERTAINLY A LOT MORE THAN I'M USED TO SUPPLYING. HERE'S THE PROBLEM WITH LITTLE KITCHEN'S? IT'S THE TIME TO KIND OF RESET THINGS HERE. NO. WE'RE OUT OF WATER. NOW? YEAH. IT COULDN'T BE BETTER TIMED. DAMN! CAN WE MAKE IT WITHOUT HAVING TO PUMP WATER? WELL, WE KIND OF STALLED. SHOULD REALLY HAVE SOME WATER. MY FAVORITE JOB... PUMPING WATER. NEVER A DULL MOMENT. ONCE THE WATER RUNS OUT, HAVE TO DROP EVERYTHING WE'RE DOING AND GO OUTSIDE AND DRILL A HOLE IN THE ICE, LAY OUT A HOSE, 40-BELOW WEATHER, AND HOPE IT DOESN'T FREEZE BEFORE YOU GET IT ALL DONE. THIS IS REALLY NICE WATER, SOME OF THE CLEANEST WATER IN THE WORLD, BUT YOU GOT TO WORK TO GET IT. IN ORDER TO REACH THE PRISTINE WATER BELOW, GARY MUST USE THE POWER AUGER TO DRILL THROUGH 6 FEET OF SOLID ICE. NOTHING IS REALLY EASY ON THE LAKE. THINGS THAT PEOPLE TAKE FOR GRANTED ON LAND ENDS UP BEING A BIG DEAL ON THE LAKE, EVEN GETTING WATER. THERE'S A LOT OF PENALTIES TO PAY, BUT THERE'S SOME REAL REWARDS, TOO. I GOT ABOUT 150 GALLONS OF WATER TO PUMP. THERE'S A TANK INSIDE. WHEN IT'S FULL, THE WATER WILL COME OUT THAT LITTLE HOSE THERE, SO I CAN JUST SORT OF SIT AND WATCH. THERE ARE NO ELECTRIC SENSORS ON GARY'S BARGE, SO THE ONLY WAY TO GUARANTEE THAT THAT TANKS ARE FULL IS TO PUMP TILL THEY OVERFLOW. FULL. OKAY, WATER'S ON. TA-DA! LOOK AT THAT. WATER. THAT IS SUCH A RELIEF. YEAH. WEATHER HERE PUT A BIT OF A CRIMP INTO THE POWER SYSTEMS. THERE'S A LOT OF LIGHTS ON AND WATER PUMP'S GOING, AND THE HEATERS ARE ALL RUNNING, AND SO IT'S JUST A BIT OF A STRAIN. BUT IT'S UP TO THE TASK. YOU WANT ME TO DO THAT AGAIN? YEAH. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU. ACROSS THE BAY, AFTER GETTING THE ENGINE STARTED, STEPHAN NOW STRUGGLES TO FREE THE BOMBARDIER FROM THE ICE BEFORE THE NEXT WAVE OF THE COLD FRONT MAKES MOVING IT IMPOSSIBLE. THAT TRACK IS STILL FROZEN INTO THIS ICE. IT'S BEEN SITTING THERE ALL WINTER. MAN! IT'S FREAKIN' PERMAFROSTED IN THERE. RIGHT HERE TO RIGHT HERE, WE ARE FROZEN STIFF. I'VE GOT TO MELT THAT. TORCH TIME. STEPHAN GRABS A TIGER TORCH, A MASSIVE PROPANE HEATING ELEMENT, TO MELT THE PERMAFROST AND FREE THE BOMBARDIER. I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ANYTHING BEFORE I MOVED UP HERE. AND WHEN I HAVE A PROBLEM, EVEN THOUGH I DON'T KNOW THE SYSTEM, THE WHEELS ARE TURNING. I'VE GOT TO IMAGINE, "HOW DOES THIS WORK?" I'VE GOT TO DO SOME RESEARCH. I'VE GOT TO ASK QUESTIONS. I'VE GOT TO ASK PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD THE PROBLEM. YOU'VE GOT TO BE INNOVATIVE HERE IN THE NORTH. IT IS CRITICAL TO YOUR SURVIVAL. THERE WE GO. ALL RIGHT, NOW, HOPEFULLY, I CAN GET THIS GUY FREE. COME ON, BABY. NOW I'M A BOMBARDIER ARCHEOLOGIST. YEAH! SUCCESS! SUCCESS! ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT! THIS IS IT, MAN. THIS IS FOR ALL THE MARBLES. AFTER A BLIZZARD BLANKETED YELLOWKNIFE BAY, SHUTTING DOWN VITAL SYSTEMS TO THESE OFF-THE-GRID HOUSEBOATS, STEPHAN HERVIEUX IS TRYING TO SALVAGE ONE VICTORY OVER THE UNPREDICTABLE LAKE, FREEING FISHERMEN BRIAN AND HENRY'S OLD BOMBARDIER FROM THE ICE. ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT! MAN. YEAH! WE DID IT! WE DID IT! YEAH, BABY! YEAH! THIS GIRL HASN'T SEEN SUNSHINE IN TWO YEARS. THE BOMBARDIER WILL GIVE ITS OWNERS PROTECTION FROM THE ELEMENTS AND ALLOW THEM TO HAUL MORE FISH. I FEEL SO GOOD RIGHT NOW. EVERYTHING I'VE DONE... SO MUCH HARD WORK, SO MUCH TIME, SO MUCH RISK, SO MANY POTENTIAL PROBLEMS, AND I'VE OVERCOME EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM. YEAH! WELL, IT SOUNDED PRETTY ROUGH, BUT SHE'S RUNNING. IT'LL GET IT THERE. HEY, I TOLD I'D GET IT GOING. GOOD MAN, GOOD MAN. RIGHT ON. I TOLD YOU I'D GET HER GOING, AND I TOLD YOU I'D GET HER OUT. YOU DID. YEP. I'M A MAN OF MY WORD. STEPHAN'S A PRETTY GOOD GUY. HE'S A SELF-STARTER, SO I THINK HE'LL BE A REAL BONUS HERE FOR ME. THIS IS GONNA HELP A WHOLE, WHOLE LOT. WE'LL BE ABLE TO BRING IN THREE TIMES AS MUCH FISH PER LOAD. THREE TIMES? YEAH. SO I JUST TRIPLED YOUR PROFITS. NO. WELL, NO. I'M BROKE, AND EVERYTHING I'VE THOUGHT OF TO TRY TO MAKE MONEY HAS NOT WORKED OUT FOR ME. I STILL HAVE MY WEDDING TO PAY FOR IN THE SPRING. I CANNOT DISAPPOINT MY LOVELY WIFE-TO-BE. I'M GONNA FIND A WAY. I NEED TO MAKE MONEY. I'M GETTING MARRIED. I'D LIKE TO COME TO WORK FOR YOU FULL TIME, MAN. I THINK WE SHOULD SIT DOWN AND TALK ABOUT IT LATER ON. ALL RIGHT. LIKE A REAL MAN. A REAL MAN. THANK YOU. YOU DONE GOOD. NOW I GOT TO GO HOME AND GET CLEANED UP. I GOT A HOT DATE WITH ALLYCE. BACK AT THE CT BARGE, GARY AND MOLLY HAVE FINALLY GOTTEN THEIR B&B; BACK UP AND RUNNING AND ARE READY FOR THE DINNER CROWD. I WOULD DEFINE SUCCESS FOR MY CAFé TO BE JUST, LIKE, TURNING A PROFIT, YOU KNOW? ESSENTIALLY, BREAKING EVEN IN A SMALL BUSINESS IS IDEAL. I MEAN, MAKING MONEY PAST THERE IS OBVIOUSLY MORE IDEAL. IT SMELLS DELICIOUS! THANK YOU! I'M GLAD YOU GUYS HERE. HEY, ALLYCE! I LOVE THIS FOOD, BABY. WE ARE HAVING WHITEFISH FROM THE FISH PLANT, - OUR FAVORITE. - OF COURSE. AND THEN WE'RE GONNA HAVE HONEY-CUMIN CARROTS AND ROSEMARY POTATOES. YES. THAT SOUNDS GREAT. YES TO ALL OF THE ABOVE. THANK YOU. HELLO! HOW ARE YOU? COME ON IN FOR YOUR FISH. NICE. RIGHT ON. HI, GUYS. HOW ARE YOU? HEY, BRIAN. HOW ARE YOU? HEY, GOOD TO SEE YOU. IT'S NICE TO HAVE A PLACE WHERE ALL THE HOUSEBOATERS CAN COME. MAKES US ALL STRONGER TO BOND. MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO SURVIVE OUT HERE ON THE LAKE. I'M GLAD MOLLY WAS THERE TO HELP WITH IT. IS THIS EVER GOOD. FOR ME NOW TO JOIN THIS COMMUNITY OF HOUSEBOATERS WHO ARE MAJOR INNOVATORS, MAJOR CREATIVE PEOPLE... THESE GUYS ARE LIKE RENAISSANCE FOLK. I'M AT HOME. I THINK ME AND MY DAD ARE REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO HAVING A GATHERING SPACE ON THE LAKE THAT IS, YOU KNOW, A REALLY GOOD COMMUNITY SPOT AND SOMETHING THAT EVERYONE CAN COME TO AN ENJOY. THE HOUSEBOATERS HAVE SOMETHING THAT THEY SHARE, YOU KNOW, THAT NOBODY ELSE REALLY UNDERSTANDS, YOU KNOW, LIKE DRILLING FOR YOUR WATER, CANOEING HOME, LIKE DOING THINGS LIKE THAT. IT'S JUST A TOTALLY DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE. MOLLY, CONGRATULATIONS. LIKE, THIS IS A LONG TIME COMING... A HOMEGROWN GIRL, A HOMEGROWN HOUSEBOAT. TO MOLLY! YAY! YAY! YAY! YAY. CLINK. LONG MAY SHE SAIL. LONG MAY SHE SAIL.
