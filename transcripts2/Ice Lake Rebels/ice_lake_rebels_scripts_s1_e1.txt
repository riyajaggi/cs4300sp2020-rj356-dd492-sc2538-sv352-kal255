 JUST 200 MILES FROM THE ARCTIC CIRCLE, IN SUBARCTIC CANADA, A GROUP OF REBELS HAVE LEFT THE LAW OF THE LAND, JOURNEYED HERE TO PLANT THEIR STAKE IN THE WATER. THE REWARD IS FREEDOM TO LIVE WITH NO AUTHORITY, NO TAXES, NO UTILITIES, AND NO HELP. WE'RE SINKING. WE'RE TAKING ON WATER RIGHT NOW. THERE'S A LIFE JACKET RIGHT HERE. THIS HOUSE CAN GO BOOM. THEY'VE ALL CHOSEN THIS LIFE AND THE CHALLENGES THAT COME WITH IT.

 IT STARTED OUT PRETTY PRIMITIVE. WE WENT OUT AND GOT A BUNCH OF 45-GALLON DRUMS AND PUTS RAFTS TOGETHER AND BUILT HOUSES ON THEM, AND THOSE WERE THE FIRST HOUSEBOATS. HOUSEBOATING IS A WAY TO NOT HAVE TO FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE TO CONFORM AND NOT FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE TO FIT IN. I KNOW MY CRAZY. DO YOU? HON! WHAT? I THINK WE'RE FROZEN IN AGAIN. NO. I'LL DO JUST ABOUT ANYTHING YOU ASK ME HERE, BUT I'M NOT **** PISSING ON THE SNOWMOBILE. IF YOU PISS ON THE FUEL PUMP,

 IT MELTS THE ICE, AND THE GAS CAN COME THROUGH. THERE'S NOTHING LIKE A GOOD DAY'S HARD WORK TO GET YOUR SPERM COUNT UP. NOW THIS LAKE IS ABOUT TO GO THROUGH A PERILOUS WINTER FREEZE. YOU GET MINUS-30, MINUS-40, MINUS-50... NOT FOR A DAY, NOT FOR A WEEK... FOR MONTHS. AND THESE REBELS HAVE MERE DAYS TO PREPARE FOR THE ONSLAUGHT OF MOTHER NATURE'S WRATH. IF I DON'T MANAGE TO GET SOME MEAT STASHED ON MY BOAT, IT'S GONNA BE A HUNGRY COUPLE OF WEEKS. IF IT'S NOT 100% LEVEL, AND THE STORMS COME IN, WE'RE GONNA SINK. WHOA, WHOA, WHOA! AAH! WE DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW MUCH WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT LIVING ON A HOUSEBOAT. LIKE, SAY IT FREEZES TOMORROW. HOW DO WE PREVENT US FROM, LIKE, FREEZING ON AN ANGLE? IT'S GO TIME. HOLY CRAP! IT'S FREAKING GREAT SLAVE, MAN. AAH! IT'S A DEADLY LAKE THAT KILLS PEOPLE EVERY YEAR. JUST A CANOE BREEZE, LAD! JUST A CANOE BREEZE. IT'S THE END OF THE SHORT SUBARCTIC SUMMER IN YELLOWKNIFE BAY WITH TEMPERATURES AT A WELCOMING 12 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT. BUT THE SHIFTING WINDS FROM THE NORTH TO SOUTHWEST HAVE BROUGHT AN EARLY FROST. AROUND HERE, IT'S KNOWN AS FREEZE-UP, ONE OF THE TWO DEADLIEST TIMES OF THE YEAR... THE OTHER BEING THE TREACHEROUS SPRING THAW KNOWN AS BREAK-UP. RIGHT NOW, EVERYONE IS IN A RACE TO MAKE SURE THEIR HOMES REMAIN LEVEL WHILE LOADING THEIR WINTER PROVISIONS ON BOARD BEFORE THEY FREEZE INTO SEVEN MONTHS OF ICE. ALL RIGHT. WE'RE GOOD. STEPHAN HERVIEUX CAME HERE TO LIVE ON THE LAKE AND OFF THE GRID, FREE FROM PROVINCIAL LAW AND THE PROTECTIONS THAT COME WITH IT. I'M FROM SUDBURY, ONTARIO, LAND OF A THOUSAND LAKES, AND I'VE ALWAYS HEARD ABOUT THESE HOUSEBOATERS, AND THEY'RE KIND OF SPOKEN AS, LIKE, THESE CREATURES... THESE SPECIAL BREED. I WOULD HEAR PEOPLE TALKING IN A PUB OR SOMETHING. THEY'D BE LIKE, "WOW, HOUSEBOATERS... "THEY DON'T WASH, "AND THEY WEAR FUNNY CLOTHES ON PURPOSE, AND THEY'RE SUCH GRANOLAS." SO I WAS HEARING ALL THIS, AND I WAS LIKE, "THEY SOUND LIKE MY KIND OF PEOPLE MAYBE." YET AFTER FOUR YEARS OF LIVING ON THE LAKE, THIS YEAR'S EARLY FREEZE HAS CAUGHT HIM OFF GUARD. AS YOU CAN SEE HERE, THE ICE HAS MOVED IN A LITTLE BIT, AND FROM HOUR TO HOUR, THINGS ARE CHANGING ALL THE TIME. OKAY, HERE WE GO. OOH! HOLY **** OVER THE NEXT THREE DAYS, THESE CHUNKS OF ICE WILL EVENTUALLY COVER THE ENTIRE LAKE, MAKING TRAVEL A TREACHEROUS AND DEADLY AFFAIR. I WANT TO GET AROUND THAT ICE FLOE RIGHT THERE. FREEZE-UP PREPARATION IS IMPERATIVE. YOU NEED YOUR WOOD. YOU GOT TO GET YOUR PROPANE, ALL YOUR SUPPLIES. I MEAN, EVERYTHING YOU'RE GONNA NEED FOR THE NEXT MINIMUM MONTH. THERE AIN'T NO **** WAY YOU WANT TO CARRY THIS **** IN FREEZE-UP. YOU JUST DON'T. IT'S JUST NONSENSE. AS CRAZY AS I AM, EVEN I WOULDN'T DO THAT. AND WE'RE IN. WHILE STEPHAN INSPECTS THE HOUSEBOAT, HIS FIANCéE, ALLYCE, ATTENDS TO OTHER CHORES. I'M TESTING THE ICE TO SEE IF IT'S SAFE. I'M TRYING TO TAKE THE DOG FOR A WALK, GET HER TO THE ISLAND SO SHE CAN DO HER BUSINESS AND COME BACK HOME. YELLOWKNIFE NATIVE ALLYCE RATTRAY HAS ALWAYS LIVED CLOSE TO THE LAKE AND OFF THE GRID. I ENDED UP MOVING ONTO THE LAKE BECAUSE I STARTED DATING STEPH. AND I FELL IN LOVE WITH THIS BEAUTIFUL HOUSE ON A LAKE, AND IT'S A DIFFERENT LIFESTYLE, AND I LOVE IT. BUT EVEN FOR THIS NORTHERNER, LIVING IN THE SUBARCTIC ON ONE OF THE DEEPEST LAKES IN THE WORLD REQUIRES SPECIAL SKILLS. YOU HAVE TO HAVE RESPECT FOR THE LAKE. YOU HAVE TO RESPECT THE ICE THAT YOU'RE WALKING ON. ALL RIGHT, DORA. OVER HERE. IT GETS TO THE POINT WHERE THE ICE IS TOO THICK FOR YOU CANOE THROUGH, BUT ALSO TOO THIN FOR YOU TO WALK ON. YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT COULD HAPPEN. EVEN WALKING YOUR DOG AT THIS POINT GETS TO BE QUITE THE CHALLENGE. I'M EXHAUSTED. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, I THINK PEOPLE CHOOSE TO LIVE ON THE WATER BECAUSE IT'S A SEPARATE WAY OF LIFE. WE HAVE NO HEATING BILL, NO WATER BILL, NO UTILITY BILL. THERE'S NOTHING EXCESS. JUST EXACTLY WHAT YOU NEED. IT'S JUST A BEAUTIFUL WAY OF LIFE. STEPHAN AND ALLYCE ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES CAUGHT OFF GUARD BY THE EARLY COLD FRONT. THERE ARE OVER 30 HOUSEBOATERS ON YELLOWKNIFE BAY, AND THEY HAVE ALL LEARNED THAT THE LAKE CHANGES ITS MOOD AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE... THE LAKE, SHE'S ANGRY. ...TURNING A SIMPLE CROSSING INTO A LIFE-OR-DEATH AFFAIR. BOAT TAKING A POUNDING. EVEN VETERAN LAKE DWELLERS GARY VAILLANCOURT AND "PIKE" MIKE HARRISON AREN'T IMMUNE TO HER TEMPESTS. I GOT THE NAME "PIKE" MIKE BECAUSE I'M A FISHING GUIDE, AND 30,000 TROPHY PIKE LATER, I DON'T KNOW. I WAS GONNA TRY AND, YOU KNOW, PUT A LITTLE BIT OF COLOR INTO THE DAY AND PADDLE ACROSS, RIGHT? BUT IT'S JUST BLOWING UP MORE AND MORE AND MORE, SO I'M NOT OVERLY INCLINED. WHAT ABOUT A FERRY ACROSS? YOU'RE TOO GOOD A FRIEND TO LET YOU PADDLE OVER, MIKE, SO... THAT'S A GOOD MAN. GREAT SLAVE LAKE IS A VERY LARGE LAKE. AND IT CAN FLAT, CALM, AND LIKE A MIRROR, AND IN TWO HOURS, YOU CAN BE WONDERING IF YOU'RE GONNA SURVIVE OR NOT BECAUSE THE WAVES ARE POUNDING OVER YOUR BOAT. SO IT WILL NOURISH YOU, AND IT WILL KICK YOUR BUTT, DEPENDING ON WHAT MOOD IT'S IN. WITH DEPTHS OF OVER 2,000 FEET AND ZERO-DEGREE TEMPERATURES, THIS ARCTIC LAKE CAN KILL A MAN WITHIN SECONDS OF FALLING IN, MAKING THESE REBELS A SPECIAL BREED OF SURVIVALIST. I'VE GOT TO BE CLOSE TO THE WATER, CLOSE TO WHERE MY BRETHREN ARE, THE FISH. I'VE MORPHED INTO HUMAN FORM TO SUPPORT THE MARGINAL SPECIES AND STAND UP FOR WHAT'S NOT UNDERSTOOD. YO, HO, HO! JUST A CANOE BREEZE, LAD. JUST A CANOE BREEZE. THE LAKE, SHE'S BEAUTIFUL WHEN SHE GETS MAD. THAT'S WHY I LOVE HER SO. DO YOU WANT TO TAKE ME ON THE INSIDE THERE? WHEN I CAME OVER HERE TO INSPECT THE SITE, MY NEIGHBOR'S PLACE DISLODGED FROM ITS MOORING. GETTING HOME IS JUST ONE CHALLENGE ON STORMY DAYS. UPROOTED ANCHORS ARE ANOTHER. SHE'S RIGHT UP AGAINST MY BOAT, AND PRETTY SOON, MAYBE CUTTING BOTH OF US LOOSE. IN ORDER TO STAY FREE FROM THE LAW, NO HOUSEBOAT CAN BE ANCHORED TO LAND, WHICH MEANS THEY HAVE TO BE ANCHORED TO THE EVER-SHIFTING SANDS OF THIS VOLATILE LAKE. THE RESULT COULD BE A HECK OF A LOT OF DAMAGE. TO AVOID A COLLISION, MIKE MUST TEMPORARILY TIE OFF TO TREES ON THE TINY, UNGOVERNED ISLAND NEARBY. SHE ALMOST KNOCKED ME OFF MY PIN, SO BASICALLY WHAT I'VE DONE IS ATTACHED THE LINE TO HER BOAT, AND I'M HAULING HER BACK. IF I DON'T GET THIS DONE, WITH THE WIND AND ALL THIS WATER COMING DOWN HERE, THIS IS GONNA PUSH MY MOORING OFF AND BOTH OF US ARE GONNA WIND UP BASHED UP AGAINST **** BARGE. IF MY MOORING BREAKS, I'M PILED UP IN A BUNCH OF SPLINTERS AGAINST A 50,000-TON BARGE. I'D HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER PLACE TO LIVE. THIS AIN'T DOING WHAT I WANT IT TO DO. **** IN THE MIDST OF A LATE OCTOBER STORM, "PIKE" MIKE HARRISON IS BATTLING TO KEEP A RUNAWAY HOUSEBOAT FROM SMASHING INTO HIS FLOATING DOCK. YOU KNOW, IT MIGHT HAPPEN. HIS ONLY OPTION IS TO TEMPORARILY TIE OFF HIS NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE TO A TREE ON A SMALL ISLAND NEARBY. WHEN YOU'RE ON THE LAKE WHEN WINTER'S ARRIVING, IT'S LIKE AN INLAND OCEAN. YOU'VE GOT 6-, 7-METER WAVES. A BIG STORM COULD BLOW YOU UP ONTO THE ROCKS AND PUNCTURE A FLOAT. NEXT THING YOU KNOW, YOUR BOAT'S SINKING. THERE'S NO RHYME OR REASON TO IT. YOU JUST HAVE TO BE PREPARED AND ADAPTABLE. COME ON, BABY. YEAH! RIGHT ON. THAT'S DEFINITELY BETTER. THERE'S A MADNESS TO MY METHODS. WELL, I MANAGED TO GET MY DOCK IN A SECURE POSITION. WHAT ELSE DOES A FELLA NEED, OUTSIDE OF A DANCE WITH YOUR SPECIAL GIRL? HOURS LATER, THE TEMPERAMENTAL LAKE CALMS DOWN... OKAY, WHAT DO I HAVE IN THIS HOUSE? ...AS STEPHAN AND ALLYCE TAKE INVENTORY OF WHAT THEY WILL NEED DURING FREEZE-UP. SO, I GOT SOUP. ONLY ONE LOAF OF BREAD. THEY'LL NEED TO BE ABLE TO SURVIVE FOR UP TO A MONTH ON THEIR HOUSEBOAT AS THE ICE EVENTUALLY THICKENS TO A DEPTH THAT WILL ALLOW THEM TO WALK ON IT SAFELY. GOT SOME RICE. NEED SOME MORE OF THAT. I THINK THOSE THREE PROPANE TANKS ARE ALL EMPTY. LIVING ON A HOUSEBOAT REQUIRES YOU TO BE 100% SELF-SUFFICIENT. ABOARD MY VESSEL, THE KIMBERLITE, YOU GOT SEVERAL SYSTEMS TO KEEP UP AND RUNNING. HERE'S MY CONTROLLER FOR THE SOLAR POWER RIGHT HERE. THE SUN IS COMING TO THESE SOLAR PANELS. MY SOLAR CHARGER INVERTER IS CONVERTING SOLAR POWER INTO USABLE ENERGY THAT I CAN USE RIGHT NOW, LIKE THIS LIGHT. NOW, THIS IS A REGISTERED VESSEL, SO I HAD A VHF MARINE RADIO. I'VE SINCE PULLED THE FUSE OUT, BECAUSE PEOPLE WOULD COME OVER HERE WHEN WE'D GET A LITTLE ROWDY, AND THEY'D BE GETTING ON THIS. NOT COOL. THIS IS VERY, VERY SERIOUS BUSINESS. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT HOUSEBOAT LIVING. THE LITTLE THINGS ARE THE BIG THINGS. HEAT... I AM LUCKY ENOUGH, ON THIS VESSEL, TO HAVE HOT WATER ON DEMAND. BASICALLY, WHEN I TURN THE PRESSURE ON FOR HEAT ON THE WATER, THAT SHOULD FIRE UP. THE THINGS THAT YOU ALL TAKE FOR GRANTED, THEY ARE THE MOST PRECIOUS THINGS TO US. HEAT, WATER, POWER. BECAUSE I'VE GOT THE HOT WATER ON DEMAND, I HAVE A LUXURIOUS AMENITY... HOT SHOWERS. THAT IS, OF COURSE, PROVIDED THAT THE HOT WATER ON DEMAND IS WORKING PROPERLY. LIVING OFF GRID, YOU HAVE ZERO SEWER SERVICES. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE TOILET. TWO YEARS AGO, WE INVESTED APPROXIMATELY $2,000 WITH SHIPPING... 'CAUSE EVERYTHING'S EXPENSIVE IN THE NORTH... AND WE BOUGHT THIS CADILLAC. IT'S GOT A 3-INCH FAN, WHICH IS ALWAYS TURNING. SO WHAT IT DOES IS IT TAKES THE MOISTURE OUT OF THAT NUMBER-2 EXCREMENT SO THAT WHAT YOU'RE LEFT WITH AT THE END OF THE DAY IS A COMPOSTABLE. THE PROBLEM WITH HOUSEBOATS IS ALWAYS GONNA BE THE SAME FOR ME. SPACE IS AT A PREMIUM. THERE'S NOT ENOUGH OF IT. AND NOW LET ME SHOW YOU THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS. AS YOU CAN SEE, IT'S LITERALLY JUST A BEDROOM. I'VE GOT ABOUT A FOOT AND A HALF BETWEEN THE BED AND THE WALL, AND THAT'S IT. IT'S JUST A PLACE TO REST YOUR BONES AND GET SOME SLEEP. I COULDN'T TELL YOU WHAT I KNOW NOW THREE YEARS AGO. I'M CONTINUOUSLY LEARNING ABOUT THE LAKE, ABOUT WHEN IT'S TIME TO GRAB PELLETS, WHEN IT'S BEST TO GRAB PROPANE WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO FREEZE-UP, BECAUSE THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES TO PAY FOR YOUR NEGLIGENCE. WE'VE STILL GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO. FOR DECADES, THE LAKE AND ITS PROMISE OF LIVING FREE HAS ATTRACTED REBELS SEEKING THE INDEPENDENCE OF LIFE OFF THE GRID. HEAVY STUFF SHOULD GO ON THE BOTTOM, 'CAUSE IF IT GOES ON THE TOP, IT'LL MAKE IT TIPPIER, RIGHT? DON'T YOU THINK? YEAH. MY NAME IS IMAN KASSAM. I'M 29 YEARS OLD. I LIVE IN YELLOWKNIFE, NORTHWEST TERRITORIES. RIGHT NOW, I LIVE IN A CONDO. IT'S A VERY TYPICAL STYLE OF LIVING. I HAVE PLUMBING. I HAVE HEATING. I HAVE ELECTRICITY. I HAVE EVERYTHING. I HAVE A FRIDGE THAT PLUGS INTO A WALL. YEAH. BUT MY PARTNER, JESSICA, RECENTLY DECIDED TO GO LIVE ON A HOUSEBOAT. THERE'S PROBABLY, LIKE, A WAY MORE EFFICIENT WAY OF DOING THIS. IT NEEDS ATTACHED? I WANT TO LIVE OFF THE GRID. I WANT TO TEST MYSELF. I WANT TO PUSH MY BOUNDARIES. THERE YOU GO. NICE. WHEN YOU LIFE ON A HOUSEBOAT, YOU HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF. LIKE, YOU HAVE TO PUT WOOD IN YOUR STOVE, AND YOU HAVE TO HAVE A GENERATOR, AND YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE YOUR LIGHTS ARE WORKING, AND YOU HAVE TO HAVE THIS RIDICULOUS AMOUNT OF HEAD LAMPS. IT MAKES YOU HOLD YOURSELF ACCOUNTABLE. I'M JUST READY FOR THAT... I WANT THAT RESPONSIBILITY. OKAY. OKAY. I THINK SOMETHING THAT REALLY WAS A BIG DRAW IN TERMS OF TRYING TO LIVE ON A HOUSEBOAT WAS THAT WE BOTH DO REALLY LIKE THE CHALLENGE. I LOOK AT THE HOUSEBOAT COMMUNITY, AND I REALLY RESPECT WHAT THEY'RE DOING, TO BE SEPARATED FROM LAND, SEPARATED FROM THE CITY. I RESPECT THE WAY THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THE LAKE AND THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THEY HAVE, AND IT IS SOMETHING I WOULD LIKE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT. DON'T TIP US. YOU DON'T FRIGGIN' TIP US. WHILE EVERY YEAR, NEW ARRIVALS ATTEMPT TO LIVE AN AUTONOMOUS LIFE ON THE LAKE, FEW SUCCEED, ESPECIALLY DURING THE FALL FREEZE-UP. IS IT THIS ONE AHEAD? IS IT THAT ONE? IT'S GOT TO BE THAT ONE. THAT ONE LOOKS LIKE THE ONE. IT'S GOT GREEN TRIM. TAKE ME HOME, WOMAN. OKAY. I'M A REALLY ADVENTUROUS PERSON. JESSICA IS JUST AS ADVENTUROUS AS I AM. WHOA. AAH! AND I THINK WE'RE BOTH JUST READY FOR, LIKE, SOMETHING REALLY COOL AND NEW AND DIFFERENT. OKAY. OKAY, WATCH YOUR HEAD. WHOA. BIGGER THAN I THOUGHT IT WAS. THIS IS WICKED. THERE'S WATER ON THE FLOOR. WHERE DID I PUT MY FLASHLIGHT? DO YOU HAVE YOUR FLASHLIGHT? YEAH. CHECK IT OUT. GO FOR A SWIM. OKAY. SO, IF WE WERE TO FALL IN IT, IT'S NOT... WE'RE NOT GONNA ACTUALLY FALL THROUGH. YEAH, THANK YOU FOR TESTING THAT, THOUGH. THE PLACE IS ACTUALLY MUCH LARGER ON THE INSIDE THAN IT LOOKS ON THE OUTSIDE. I THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE SMALLER. YOU KNOW, THERE'S A COUCH, THERE'S A BED, THERE'S A "BATHROOM." YOU... YOU OKAY? IT'S JUST A BUCKET. IT'S ALL RIGHT. IT'S LIKE CAMPING. JUST A BUCKET? NO, LIKE A HUNTING BUCKET. GOD. AND IT'S NOT THAT THE HUNTING BUCKET MAKES ME NERVOUS. IT'S THAT IT'S LIKE IT IS... IT COULD... ENCLOSED SPACE AND, YOU KNOW, I'M A LADY. WE'RE GONNA GET REALLY CLOSE... YEAH, WELL... ...REALLY QUICKLY. HOLY CRAP! WE'RE SINKING. WE'RE TAKING ON WATER RIGHT NOW. IF IT'S NOT 100% LEVEL, WHEN THE STORMS COME IN, THIS HOUSE CAN GO BOOM. LIFE IN THE SUBARCTIC IS PERILOUS, BUT HOUSEBOATER RANDY SIBBESTON, A DESCENDANT OF THE MéTIS TRIBE, WHOSE FAMILY HAS CALLED THE SHORES OF GREAT SLAVE LAKE HOME FOR GENERATIONS, WOULDN'T TRADE IT FOR ANYTHING. I ALWAYS FOUND IT A LITTLE BIT FRUSTRATING LIVING IN CLOSE PROXIMITY WITH SO MANY PEOPLE, WHERE YOU HAVE TO MAKE INFINITE CONCESSIONS. AFTER A WHILE, I GOT TIRED OF IT. AND HOUSEBOATING, FOR ME, IS A WAY TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF EXTRA FREEDOM AND NOT HAVE TO FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE TO CONFORM AND NOT FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE TO FIT IN. RANDY'S PREPARING TO HUNT BIG GAME, BUT WITH HIS MEAT SUPPLY ALMOST GONE AND FREEZE-UP LESS THAN A WEEK AWAY, HE ONLY HAS DAYS TO TRANSPORT FRESH MEAT BY BOAT TO HIS HOME BEFORE THE LAKE'S ICE MAKES IT NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE. I'M NOT EXACTLY A LONE WOLF. I HAVE A WIFE AND SIX KIDS. MY JOB, AS THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY, IS TO PROVIDE FOOD AND COMFORT AND SECURITY FOR STEPHANIE AND THE KIDS. AND I TAKE THAT JOB VERY SERIOUSLY. I TRY TO SHOP AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE AT THE STORE, JUST BECAUSE THE QUALITY OF FOOD THESE DAYS IS... A LOT OF IT IS QUESTIONABLE. MYSELF, I SEE THE VALUE IN BEING ABLE TO GO OUT INTO THE BUSH AND BE ABLE TO RUSTLE UP SOME FOOD FOR MY FAMILY SO THAT WE CAN HAVE VERY NUTRITIONAL, PURE, UNTAINTED FOOD. BACK IN YELLOWKNIFE BAY... OKAY, YOU GOT ELECTRICAL TAPE? YEP. BEAUTIFUL. ...STEPHAN AND ALLYCE CONTINUE CHECKING THEIR VESSEL TO MAKE SURE IT WILL SURVIVE FREEZE-UP. THE MAIN WORRY OF EVERY HOUSEBOATER IS THAT OUR HOUSE FREEZES IN ON AN ANGLE. THIS IS WHAT I CALL A HOUSEBOATER'S LEVEL. AND I DEMONSTRATE. SO, THAT'LL TELL ME WHERE THE PITCH IS. IF YOU'RE FROZEN INTO AN ANGLE, THAT'S WHERE YOU ARE ALL WINTER. SO ABSOLUTELY, BEFORE IT FREEZES, YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS LEVEL. AND NOW I WANT A CROSS SECTION TO SEE IF I'M IN BALANCE HORIZONTALLY. OKAY, SO WE'RE OBVIOUSLY LISTING THAT WAY AND THIS WAY, SO WE'RE BASICALLY LIKE THIS. AND THIS HAS TO BE CORRECTED BEFORE FREEZE-UP. IF IT'S NOT 100% LEVEL AND THE STORMS COME IN, WE'RE GONNA SINK. FREAKIN' FREEZE-UP? IT'S ALWAYS SOMETHING. IT NEVER FREAKING ENDS. NEW ARRIVALS IMAN AND JESSICA ARE GETTING A SENSE OF THE STRUGGLES WHICH COME FROM CHOOSING TO LIVE ON GREAT SLAVE LAKE RIGHT BEFORE IT ICES OVER. WHEN I FIRST HEARD THAT THIS HOUSEBOAT OPPORTUNITY OPENED UP, I WAS EXTREMELY EXCITED. NOW THAT IT'S A LITTLE WHILE LATER, THE NERVES ARE SETTING IN A LITTLE BIT. IT'S SUCH A SCARY TRANSITION TO MOVE ON A HOUSEBOAT IN THE WINTER DURING FREEZE-UP FOR THE FIRST TIME. TRYING TO GET LITTLE PIECES, 'CAUSE WE JUST HAVE A LITTLE STOVE. WHAT IF WE RUN OUT OF WOOD? WHAT IF WE RUN OUT OF ELECTRICITY? AND HAVE YOU SEEN THAT WATER? IT'S TREACHEROUS. IT'S CRAZY, AND IT'S COLD. IT'S FREEZING COLD, THAT WATER. WHAT IF WE FALL IN? OKAY, WE HAVE A LOT TO DO TONIGHT. THERE'S A LOT OF CHALLENGES TO LIVING ON A HOUSEBOAT, AND THERE'S A LOT MORE WORK INVOLVED. WE'RE FEELING CONFIDENT, BUT FEELING LIKE WE GOT A LOT OF LEARNING TO DO. I THINK PROBABLY WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WE DON'T KNOW. WE DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW MUCH WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT LIVING ON A HOUSEBOAT, SO I'M EXPECTING IT TO BE A STEEP LEARNING CURVE. QUESTION. YOU KNOW HOW WHEN IT FREEZES, HOW THE HOUSEBOATS FREEZE WHERE THEY'RE AT, RIGHT? DO WE NEED TO... LIKE, CAN IT JUST... LIKE, HOW DO WE PREVENT US FROM, LIKE, FREEZING ON AN ANGLE? YOU KNOW, YOU'VE SEEN, LIKE, THE HOUSEBOATS, AND THEY FREEZE LIKE... I DON'T KNOW. HOW DO WE KNOW IF WE'RE ON AN ANGLE THIS SECOND? I WOULD DEFINITELY SAY, AS THE FREEZE GETS CLOSER AND AS MORE ICE IS ON THE LAKE, MY BIGGEST FEAR IS THAT WE'RE NOT PREPARED. LIKE, SAY IT FREEZES TONIGHT AND TOMORROW, AND IN TWO DAYS, IF WE DIDN'T DO SOMETHING THAT WE WERE SUPPOSED TO DO TO THE FLOATS, IT'S TOO LATE. WE DIDN'T DO IT. AND WE'RE JUST, LIKE, IN BIG TROUBLE FOR THE WINTER. YOU'RE MAKING ME SUPER PARANOID NOW. I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE IT'S NOT THE BEST TIME TO BE BRAND-NEW TO A HOUSEBOAT, RIGHT AROUND THE TIME OF FREEZE-UP. I'M NERVOUS NOW. 10 MILES SOUTHWEST OF YELLOWKNIFE BAY, RANDY SIBBESTON HUNTS FOR THE FRESH MEAT SO VITAL FOR HIS FAMILY'S WINTER SURVIVAL. HE NEEDS A KILL NOW IN ORDER TO SAFELY CANOE THE HEAVY ANIMAL ACROSS THE LAKE BEFORE FREEZE-UP. HERE IN THE GREAT NORTHWEST TERRITORIES, WHEN WINTER COMES, IT COMES WITH A FURY AND A VENGEANCE THAT IT'S ALMOST AS THOUGH NATURE WANTS YOU TO PAY FOR THE BEAUTIFUL SUMMER THAT YOU JUST HAD. AND WINTER IS DEFINITELY COMING. I KNOW THERE'S AN AREA ON THE OTHER SIDE THERE THAT THE MOOSE LOVE TO HANG OUT IN. I'D LOVE TO BE ABLE TO TAKE A LOOK OVER THERE, BUT THE ICE ISN'T REALLY THICK ENOUGH TO WALK ON ALL THE WAY AROUND. BUT I'M HOPING THAT I'LL BE ABLE TO FIND A LITTLE SPOT THAT'S GOT AT LEAST A FEW INCHES OF ICE THAT I CAN WALK ACROSS ON. I'M JUST GONNA MAKE MYSELF A LITTLE BIT OF A WALKING STICK SO WHEN I GO OUT ON THE ICE, IF I FALL THROUGH, I'LL BE ABLE TO AT LEAST PULL MYSELF BACK UP ONTO THE ICE. YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO WEIGH MY RISKS, RIGHT, AND THIS IS JUST ONE OF THOSE TIMES WHERE I'M GONNA TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF A CHANCE HERE IN ORDER TO SEE IF I CAN GET SOME FRESH MEAT. LOOKS LIKE IT'S PRETTY THIN OVER THERE. ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH FREEZE-UP IS JUST AT THIS TIME OF YEAR THERE'S ICE, BUT IT'S IN VARYING THICKNESS. YOU KNOW, IT COULD BE 3 INCHES, 4 INCHES RIGHT ON THE SHORE, AND THEN YOU GO OUT A LITTLE BIT FURTHER, AND IT'S MAYBE AN INCH THICK OR HALF AN INCH THICK. CAN SPELL DISASTER FOR YOU. 10 MILES SOUTH OF YELLOWKNIFE BAY AND ON MARSHLAND, RANDY SIBBESTON NEEDS TO CROSS A THINLY FROZEN RIVER IN ORDER TO CONTINUE HIS HUNT FOR MOOSE, VITAL PROTEIN THAT WILL GET HIM AND HIS FAMILY THROUGH THE UPCOMING FREEZE. WALKING OUT ON THE THIN ICE AT THIS TIME OF YEAR IS A DANGEROUS THING. IF YOU FALL THROUGH AND YOU GET WET AND SOAKED RIGHT THROUGH, THE COLD JUST GOES RIGHT TO YOUR BONE, AND THAT WATER'S PROBABLY ONLY MAYBE 3 DEGREES. I'M NOT THE KIND OF PERSON TO GO OUT ON A LIMB FOR NO REASON. BUT I'M WILLING TO RISK CERTAIN THINGS FOR A QUALITY OF LIFE. TO ME, I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN... DETERMINED TO CONQUER MY FEARS SO THAT MY WILL IS THE DOMINANT FORCE IN NATURE. FAILURE IS NOT AN OPTION. MEANWHILE, BACK IN YELLOWKNIFE BAY, THE ICE CONTINUES TO FORM ON THE CHURNING LAKE. BUT IT REMAINS UNSTABLE. AAH! SO, I'M AT THE BACK OF THE BOAT, AND I HEAR IMAN SCREAMING MY NAME. MY GOD! YOU KNOW THAT FEELING WHERE YOUR HEART JUST SORT OF SINKS? YOU JUST KNOW SOMETHING IS WRONG. AND I JUST BOLTED TO THE FRONT DOOR AND RIGHT AWAY SAW THAT SHE WAS IN THE WATER. SHE HAD FALLEN THROUGH THE ICE, AND SHE LOOKED SO SCARED. OKAY. YOU'RE OKAY. HEY, LOOK AT ME. YOU'RE OKAY. WE'RE GONNA GET INSIDE, TAKE ALL YOUR CLOTHES OFF. TAKE OFF MY BOOTS. SHE WAS JUST YELLING, LIKE, THAT SHE COULDN'T FEEL HER FEET, AND SO I YANKED HER BOOTS OFF. AND THEN WE KIND OF HALF-CRAWLED AND WE HALF-DRAGGED HER INSIDE AS FAST AS POSSIBLE. I COULD SEE THAT SHE WAS GASPING. YOU'RE OKAY. YOU'RE OKAY. SWEATER. SWEATER. IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO NOT JUST WARM UP YOUR BODY, BUT EVEN AFTER YOU'RE WARM AGAIN, YOUR BODY IS STILL RECOVERING FROM THIS MAJOR SHOCK. YOU'RE OKAY. YOU'RE OKAY. YOU'RE OKAY. SHE WAS SO COLD, SHE JUST KEPT SAYING, "I'M SO COLD I CAN'T BREATHE. I'M SO COLD." AND SHE WAS REALLY FREAKED OUT. AND I WAS TRYING TO STAY CALM TO HELP HER, BUT I WAS REALLY WORRIED ABOUT HER, TOO. IT WAS REALLY SCARY. I'M IN THE WATER, AND I COULDN'T FEEL ANYTHING. I COULDN'T EVEN... I COULDN'T EVEN LIFT MY LEGS AND, LIKE, I HAD LOST ALL SENSATION OF MY TOES, MY LEGS. AND IT WAS SO CLEAR TO ME HOW IMPOSSIBLE IT WAS TO GET OUT. LIKE, I JUST DIDN'T FEEL STRONG. AND I WAS BREATHING SO PANICKY AND HEAVILY, AND IT WAS... IT WAS A REALLY WEIRD FEELING. THIS IS YOUR BOOT. WE WERE CONFIDENT THAT WE COULD DO THIS, THAT WE COULD LIVE ON A HOUSEBOAT. THIS INCIDENT SORT OF REMINDED US THAT, YOU'RE NOT IN CHARGE. THE LAKE IS IN CHARGE. IT'S SCARY. IT'S NOT EASY AND NOW I UNDERSTAND WHY, DURING FREEZE-UP AND BREAK-UP, IT'S SO, LIKE, IMPERATIVE THAT PEOPLE PREPARE AND PEOPLE ARE EXTRA CAUTIOUS AND EXTRA CAREFUL. I DON'T THINK I FULLY UNDERSTOOD IT UNTIL, LIKE... UNTIL NOW. AS IMAN RECOVERS FROM HER BRUSH WITH DEATH... READY? I WON'T POINT OUT THAT I KEEP GETTING THE HEAVY END. HEY, HEY, HEY. ...STEPHAN AND ALLYCE HAVE ADDED NEARLY A TON OF PROPANE, GASOLINE, FIREWOOD, AND CANNED GOODS TO SURVIVE THE WINTER. BUT THIS YEAR, THE LAKE'S EVER-SHIFTING WIND AND WAVES ARE TAKING A TOLL ON THEIR HOME. WE'RE TILTED RIGHT NOW, SO WE'RE TRYING TO BALANCE OUR BOAT, MOVING AROUND ALL OUR PROPANE TANKS, OUR PELLETS. JUST TRYING TO GET IT LEVEL. LOOK AT THIS. THAT'S FAST. I DON'T NEED THAT TO TELL ME. I'M SLIDING LIKE THAT. I'M SORRY, I JUST THOUGHT I'D DEMONSTRATE IT. OKAY, OKAY, COME ON. HUP! WHAT HAPPENED? HOLY CRAP! OKAY, OKAY, GEEZ. YEP, I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT WAS GONNA HAPPEN. THAT TILT IS AMAZINGLY BAD. OKAY, LET'S GET ON WITH THIS. MY HOUSEBOAT WAS TILTING. I WAS JUST... I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT. I WENT FROM LIKE THIS TO THAT. DORA! GOD, MAN. I GOT TO CHECK THOSE LINES, HON. THERE'S A LIFE JACKET RIGHT HERE. WHERE'S MY RED ONE? WHERE'S MY GOOD ONE? I DON'T KNOW, BUT I DON'T REALLY THINK THERE'S TIME FOR THAT. THERE IS NO TIME FOR THAT. YOU CAN'T INSURE A HOUSEBOAT, SO IF IT SINKS, YOU'RE OUT YOUR MONEY. YOU'VE GOT NO INVESTMENT. YOU'RE DONE. I'M GONNA HAVE TO JUMP IN THERE, BREAK THAT ICE. AS YOU CAN SEE, THIS LINE RIGHT HERE... YOU SEE THAT LINE GOT CAUGHT IN THE ICE WHEN IT FROZE UP ZIGZAG. I NEED IT TO BE TIGHT AND TENSION. IF IT'S NOT 100% TIGHT AND THE STORMS COME IN, THIS HOUSE CAN GO BOOM. THAT SHOULD BE ABOUT 6 TO 8 INCHES OUT OF THE WATER. THE HOUSE IS IN THE WATER RIGHT NOW, AND IT'S GO TIME. BREAKING UP THIS ICE SO I CAN GET A GOOD LINE. I NEED THIS HOUSEBOAT TO BE 100% SECURE. I DON'T TRUST THIS ICE. IT'S NOT THAT GREAT. MOORING IS ALL YOU'VE GOT HOLDING YOU IN PLACE. IT'S YOUR SAFETY NET. IT'S YOUR FOUNDATION. IT'S EVERYTHING. YOU GOT **** MOORING? YOU'RE **** CAREFUL. YOU KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM IS? IT'S ALL THOSE PELLETS WE PUT ON THE HOUSE RIGHT BEFORE IT FROZE. GO TO THE TOP RIGHT NOW! RIGHT NOW! I GOT IT. IT WAS PERFECTLY FLAT THE OTHER DAY. WE EVENED IT OUT FOR FREEZE-UP. THE STORMS CAME IN. I'VE GOT A BIGGER PROBLEM NOW. LOOK AT THIS PLACE. WE'RE SINKING. WE'RE TAKING ON WATER RIGHT NOW. IN YELLOWKNIFE BAY, HOME TO OVER 30 HOUSEBOATS FLOATING OFF GRID AND FREE FROM SOCIETY'S RULES AND REGULATIONS, STEPHAN AND ALLYCE HAVE A PONTOON THAT IS TAKING ON WATER AND THREATENING TO SINK THEIR UNINSURED HOUSE. LOOK AT THIS PLACE. WE'RE SINKING. WE'RE TAKING ON WATER RIGHT NOW. OUR HOUSEBOAT IS FLOATING ON TWO ALUMINUM PONTOONS THAT GO THE LENGTH OF THE HOUSE. THEY ARE EACH SET UP WITH SEPARATE SECTIONS. IF ONE OF THE FLOATS DOES GET FLOODED, THEN ESPECIALLY IN FREEZE-UP, YOU NEED TO FIX IT RIGHT AWAY. THERE YOU GO. THE FREEZING TEMPERATURES WILL EXPAND ANY WATER TRAPPED IN THEIR FLOTATIONS INTO ICE, BUSTING PONTOONS WIDE OPEN AND SINKING THEIR HOME. NOW, THIS STEP HERE SHOULD BE AS HIGH AS THAT ONE THERE. SO YOU CAN TELL THAT, EVEN THOUGH WE'VE MOVED ALL THE WAY, WE STILL GOT WATER IN THE PONTOONS AND WE'RE LISTING. OBVIOUSLY. AT THIS POINT, THERE'S A HOLE IN THAT PONTOON. BECAUSE THE HOUSEBOAT IS SINKING, I CAN'T EVEN ACCESS AND PUMP IT OUT. AND WE'RE SUBMERGED. SEE, THERE'S TOO MUCH WEIGHT ON THIS SIDE, STILL. HOLD ON A SECOND. I'M GONNA SEE IF I CAN MOVE STUFF AROUND THE OTHER END. I NEED TO GET ALL THE WEIGHT OFF THIS BOAT RIGHT NOW SO THAT THE PONTOON GETS ABOVE THE WATER LINE SO THAT I CAN PULL THAT PLUG OUT AND THEN PUMP THE PONTOON OUT. I FEEL IT ALREADY. GOD. START HER UP. BASICALLY, THE LAKE RIGHT NOW IS ZERO DEGREES. I CAN GO IN THERE FOR MAYBE 5, 10 MINUTES AT A TIME, AND THEN I GOT TO COME OUT, 'CAUSE MY HANDS WILL LOSE FEELING, AND THEN HYPOTHERMIA CAN SET IN. THAT SOUNDS EMPTY TO ME, MAN. SO NOW I'VE GOT TO CHECK EVERY PONTOON AND EVERY BULKHEAD TO SEE WHAT ELSE IS BREACHED. STEPHAN'S THIN RED SUIT WAS NO MATCH FOR THE FREEZING WATER, FORCING HIM TO CHANGE INTO A THICKER BLUE DRY SUIT TO AVOID HYPOTHERMIA. MY GOD! THERE'S SO MANY LEAKS IN THIS SUIT. IN AND OUT, BABE. IN AND OUT. SO COLD. YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW COLD THIS WATER IS UNTIL YOU'VE BEEN IN IT. IF HE WASN'T WEARING THIS DRY SUIT, IT WOULD BE 10 SECONDS, AND HE'D BE NUMB, AND HE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO GET OUT. MAN. THIS DRY SUIT IS SAVING HIM, BUT HE CAN'T SPEND LONG UNDER THERE. THERE'S NO WAY. I FEEL JUST QUEASY. I FEEL WEIRD. IMAN'S SLOW RECOVERY FROM THE ICY WATER REMINDS JESSICA HOW DANGEROUS LIVING ON THE LAKE CAN BE. YOU HEART RATE'S OKAY. YOU'RE BREATHING OKAY. BUT IT IS A SHOCK, AND THERE WAS A LOT OF ADRENALINE, AND YOU WERE PRETTY... YOU GOT PRETTY UPSET. YEAH. AS THE FREEZE GETS CLOSER, JUST REALIZING THAT THE LAKE IS IN CHARGE AND THAT THE LAKE'S NOT PLAYING BY OUR RULES, WE'RE PLAYING BY THE LAKE'S RULES, IS REALLY SCARY. I FEEL OUT OF BREATH. I FEEL LIKE MY BREATHING'S FUNNY. I FEEL LIKE I CAN'T STAND. MY LEGS ARE A LITTLE WEAK. WE TALKED ABOUT IT. IS THIS STILL WHAT WE WANT TO BE DOING? IS THIS STILL OKAY? RIGHT NOW, I'M NOT REALLY THAT SURE. MEANWHILE, ON AN ISLAND 15 MILES TO THE SOUTH, RANDY CONTINUES HIS MOOSE HUNT BEFORE THE IMPEDING FREEZE MAKES HAULING HIS KILL BY BOAT IMPOSSIBLE. THE STAPLE FOOD IS MOOSE MEAT. THAT'S THE... THAT'S THE CALL OF A LONELY COW MOOSE. IF YOU REALLY WANT TO ATTRACT A BULL, THAT'S THE CALL YOU WANT TO MAKE, BECAUSE THEY HEAR THAT, THEY'LL COME RUNNING. THE MOOSE HAVEN'T BEEN RESPONDING TO MY CALLS, SO I'M GONNA TRY THIS, 'CAUSE THIS IS A GOOD OLD TRICK THAT... IT MAKES A PRETTY CONVINCING MOOSE CALL, ACTUALLY. I'VE GOT TO... I'VE GOT TO GET SOMETHING TO EAT. IN THE NORTHEAST CORNER OF GREAT SLAVE LAKE, JESSICA AND IMAN MAKE A DIFFICULT CHOICE TO LEAVE. STEER US, OKAY? OKAY. OKAY. LIVING ON THE MOLLY BARGE WAS PROBABLY NOT EXACTLY WHAT WE EXPECTED. WE KIND OF HAD THIS IDEA THAT WE WERE GONNA GO OUT AND HAVE AN ADVENTURE AND SORT OF JUMP RIGHT IN AND LEARN ON THE FLY. AND SOMETIMES, THAT WORKED. AND SOMETIMES, LEARNING ON THE FLY WASN'T THE BEST WAY TO GO ABOUT IT. USE YOUR FOOT STRENGTH. THE CANOE'S SO HEAVY RIGHT NOW. I THINK THE TIME OF YEAR TO MOVE IN WAS... A LITTLE BOLD. BUT I'M SO GRATEFUL THAT WE WERE ABLE TO GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO TEST OUT LIVING ON AN HOUSEBOAT. IT WAS A HUGE LEARNING EXPERIENCE. WANT TO HOP OUT? WITHOUT FALLING IN? I CAN MANAGE HOLDING THE CANOE WITHOUT FALLING IN. I DO WANT TO LIVE ON A HOUSEBOAT AGAIN. I REALLY WANT TO. I WANT TO LIVE OFF THE GRID. I DO. I JUST WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO IT NEXT TIME AROUND A LITTLE BIT MORE PREPARED. NOW WE KNOW. MEANWHILE, RANDY'S UNSUCCESSFUL HUNT MEANS MORE DAYS WILL HAVE TO BE SPENT LOOKING FOR BIG GAME TO BRING HOME TO HIS FAMILY. STILL HAVEN'T GOTTEN ANYTHING. IT'S GETTING DARK, AND IT'S COLD, SO I GONNA MAKE A FIRE AND GET MYSELF SET UP. GONNA MAKE CAMP. JUST GET A RIPPING FIRE GOING HERE. SO, I'M GONNA HAVE TO LOOK AT MY OPTIONS AND FIGURE OUT A DIFFERENT COURSE OF ACTION TOMORROW. THE ONE THING I LEARNED WHEN I WAS YOUNG WAS THAT THE ONLY WAY YOU DON'T GET SKUNKED WHEN YOU'RE HUNTING IS IF YOU DON'T GIVE UP TILL YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING. IF I'VE GOT TO SPEND THREE, FOUR DAYS OUT HERE HUNTING UNTIL I GET SOMETHING TO EAT, THAT'S WHAT I HAVE TO DO. TOMORROW WILL BE A BETTER DAY. I'M SO HUNGRY. ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BAY, STEPHAN HAS SPENT AN ARDUOUS FOUR HOURS IN AND OUT OF ICY WATER, MAKING SURE ALL HIS PONTOONS ARE AIRTIGHT. NO ONE HAS ANY CLAIM OR STAKE TO THE WATER. IT'S GREAT SLAVE. IT'S GONNA DO WHAT IT DOES. SO, WHAT YOU'VE GOT TO DO IS WATCH, LISTEN, LEARN, AND DO WHAT YOU CAN. WHATEVER'S INSIDE OF YOUR CONTROL, YOU'D BETTER TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT. YEP! I THINK I GOT IT. I THINK WE'RE GOOD TO GO. WE'RE WILLING TO RISK OUR LIVES A LITTLE BIT FOR THE PEACE OF BEING ON THE BAY. IT'S WORTH IT. AND YOU TAKE EVERYTHING IN STRIDE. YOU HAVE RESPECT FOR THE LAKE. YOU'LL MAKE IT. THIS IS GREAT. EVERYTHING IS A-OKAY IN MY OPINION. LOOK AT THAT. LOOK AT ALL THAT CLEARANCE. I HAD TO FIGHT FOR MY HOUSE AND MY SURVIVAL TODAY. I FEEL ALIVE, MORE ALIVE THAN I'VE EVER FELT IN MY ENTIRE EXISTENCE LIVING IN NORMAL CONDITIONS. WE MADE IT, BABY! WE MADE IT. I LOVE YOU, DARLING. SOME PEOPLE DEFINITELY WOULD LOOK AT US AS IF WE'RE LIVING THIS PRIMAL, KIND OF PRIMITIVE LIFESTYLE AND THROUGH THE SUBARCTIC WINTERS AND THE SPRINGS AND THE FALLS. BUT, I MEAN, ISN'T YOUR LIFE A CHALLENGE, GETTING IN YOUR CAR, DRIVING FOR FOUR HOURS TO COMMUTE, STUCK IN TRAFFIC, DOING NOTHING BUT CURSING THE GUY IN FRONT, THE GUY BEHIND. I MEAN, WHAT'S A CHALLENGE? WHAT'S PRIMITIVE? WHAT'S CRAZY? I MEAN, I KNOW MY CRAZY. DO YOU? I COULD DO NOT ASK FOR A STRONGER WOMAN. I COULD NOT HAVE MADE A STRONGER WOMAN. "MADE?" IF I WAS... I'M JUST SAYING, IF I HAD... YOU KNOW, IF YOU COULD MAKE SOMEBODY, I COULDN'T MAKE ANYTHING AS GOOD AS YOU. YOU'RE THE BEST. YOU'RE THE BEST. BY MORNING, A FINE LAYER OF ICE ONE INCH THICK BLANKETS THE BAY... ...CONSTANTLY SHIFTING AND MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO TRANSPORT ANY MORE SUPPLIES. TWO, THREE, COME ON! COME ON, GET BACK OVER. THERE WE GO. THE DEADLIEST TIME OF YEAR IS HERE. WELL, THIS IS FREEZE-UP. IT'S ABOUT MINUS-12, MINUS-15 DEGREES, BUT THIS AIN'T WINTER. WINTER IS STILL COMING. THIS SEASON ON "ICE LAKE REBELS"... MOST PEOPLE HAVE NO IDEA HOW EXTREME WINTER LIVING IS HERE. I SERIOUSLY THINK THE LAKE IS TRYING TO KILL ME. IT'S BELOW ZERO IN HERE. I THINK WE'RE FROZEN IN AGAIN. IF I CAN'T GET THIS HOUSE HEATED UP, ALL OF MY SYSTEMS ARE GONNA BE AFFECTED. PIPES ARE GONNA BURST, MY ELECTRICAL SYSTEM'S GONNA GO, MY BATTERIES ARE GONNA FREEZE... EVERY SYSTEM IN MY HOUSE IS THREATENED AT THIS POINT. THIS PLACE, IT'S OUR MEDICINE CHEST, IT'S OUR SUPERMARKET. WE RELY ON IT FOR EVERYTHING. BUSH SURVIVAL IS KEY TO MAKE IT OUT HERE. YOU HAVE TO KNOW HOW TO LIVE OFF THE LAND. WE HAVE OUR OWN LAWS. WE HAVE OUR OWN RULES. AND WE'RE INDEPENDENT. YOU JUST GRIND THROUGH IT, 'CAUSE IF YOU DON'T, YOU'RE DONE. WHOA! NO! **** I'VE GOT YOU. ABSOLUTELY AT THE MERCY OF THE LAKE. BRIAN AND STEPHAN ARE NOT BACK YET FROM CHECKING THE NETS. IN THE REGULAR WORLD, PEOPLE JUST CALL 911 WHEN SOMEBODY GOES MISSING. BUT WE DON'T HAVE THAT OUT HERE. STEPH, WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU? WELL, THEY SAY HELL IS HOT. I DISAGREE. IT'S COLD.
