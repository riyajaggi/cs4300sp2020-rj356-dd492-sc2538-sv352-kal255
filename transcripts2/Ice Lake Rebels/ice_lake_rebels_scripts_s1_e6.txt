 IT'S LATE WINTER IN YELLOWKNIFE BAY, AND AFTER SIX MONTHS OF HARD FREEZE WITH MINIMUM DAYLIGHT, CABIN FEVER IS AT AN ALL-TIME HIGH. HEY, GUYS. GUYS. YOU'RE NOT GONNA PLAY WITH IT IF YOU'RE GONNA BE ROUGH WITH IT. THIS TIME OF YEAR IN THE NORTH IS TIME FOR CABIN FEVER. YOU GET CABIN FEVER FROM BEING INSIDE SO MUCH DURING THE WINTER. HEY, AMBER. UNH-UNH-UNH-UNH. DON'T YOU BITE YOUR BROTHER. I MEAN, I JUST DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO BE STUCK IN MY HOUSEBOAT. THAT'S THE THING, RIGHT? FOR A GUY LIKE ME, IT'S ALL ABOUT THE FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT. IT'S ALL ABOUT THE FLEXIBILITY. SO THAT'S NOT A DESIRABLE SITUATION AT ALL. I'VE BEEN OUT HERE FOR 35 YEARS. THIS TIME OF YEAR, WINTER HAS SUCH A GRIP. I'VE NEVER REALLY EVER GOT USED TO IT. BREAK-UP'S COMING PRETTY SOON, AND IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE IT'S SPRING FEVER, BUT IT'S BEEN REALLY COLD. IT'S BEEN COLDER THAN NORMAL, AND DARK. I LIVE BY MYSELF IN A HOUSEBOAT. IT GETS A LITTLE LONELY OUT THERE. HUMAN BEINGS DON'T REALLY BELONG HERE. WE'RE ADAPTING. I FELL IN LOVE WITH IT AND I'M STILL HERE. SOME DAYS I WONDER WHY WE DON'T JUST LIVE ON LAND. NO, YOU DON'T. YOU'D GET FRUSTRATED. REMEMBER HOW YOU FEEL WHEN YOU FIX IT. WE'RE PROBABLY IN THE WORST WINTER. IT CAN REALLY START TO DRIVE A PERSON CRAZY. STEPH HAS A HARD TIME SITTING STILL ON A REGULAR DAY, SO WHEN CABIN FEVER SETS IN, HE CAN REALLY GO CRAZY. TINKERING WITH THINGS AND FIXING STUFF. BUT IN THE END, HE REALLY JUST TENDS TO BREAK THINGS. I CAN'T WAIT FOR WINTER TO BREAK TO GET HIM OUT OF THE HOUSE. NO POWER? NO. OKAY, SO THE TUMBLER, WHEN I FLIP THIS SWITCH, IS SAYING REVERSE POLARITY. OKAY, I'VE GOT IT. I'VE GOT IT. DADDY-O! HOLD THAT THOUGHT. WAIT FOR IT. ONE SECOND. WE'RE KILLING THAT L.E.D. LIGHT BECAUSE WHEN THE GENERATOR RUNS, THIS CAN'T BE ON. OKAY. OKAY, I GOT IT. I GOT IT. I GOT IT. OKAY, FLICK-A THE SWITCH. READY? ON. COME ON, MAN! EARLY SPRING HERE MEANS DAYLIGHT NOW DOMINATES THE SKY. WITH MORE THAN 13 HOURS OF WARMING SUN, TEMPERATURES RISE FROM MINUS-20 TO PLUS-20, AND THIS FROZEN LAKE IS ABOUT TO THAW. FOR THE COOPED-UP HOUSEBOATERS, THEY HAVE A FEW DAYS TO BE ABLE TO USE THIS ICE LAKE AS GROUND TO GATHER, TRADE, AND PLAY BEFORE THEIR WORLD BREAKS APART UNDER THEIR FEET. GETTING TO BE LATE WINTER, SPRING, AND SORT OF THOUGHT THAT THIS YEAR WOULD BE A GOOD YEAR TO GET RID OF A FEW THINGS THAT I REALLY DON'T NEED, AND SEEING AS HOW THE ICE IS STILL GOOD AND PEOPLE CAN GET AROUND, IT'S JUST A GOOD TIME OF YEAR TO DO IT. STUFF'S GOT TO BE TRADABLE. AT THE END OF WINTER, THE HOUSEBOATERS GATHER FOR A SPRING CLEANING SWAP MEET... A UNIQUE TRADITION THAT ALLOWS EVERYONE A CHANCE TO GET OUT AND TRADE FOR ESSENTIALS THAT WILL HELP THEM THROUGH THE UPCOMING BREAK-UP. ALL RIGHT, WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BRING TO THE MEET? I'M BRINGING THAT BOAT MOTOR 'CAUSE I GOT A BIGGER ONE NOW. GOOD IDEA. YEAH. WE'VE HAD THAT ON THE HOUSE TOO LONG. BARTERING IS THE OLDEST CURRENCY IN THE WORLD, AND IT'S STILL ALIVE AND WELL HERE IN THE BAY. HOW ABOUT THE BARBECUE? YEAH, WE GOT A NEWER ONE. YEAH. TAKE CARE OF THE PORTABLE BARB. PORTABLE BARBECUE'S GONE. OKAY. GAS TANK. YOU ACCUMULATE A LOT OF STUFF THAT YOU CAN'T IN THE SUMMER BECAUSE OF SPACE, AND GOT A COUPLE OF THINGS I WANT TO UNLOAD. I'LL FINALLY HAVE AN ENTRANCEWAY AGAIN WITHOUT ALL THIS STUFF. WELL, IT'S NICE TO GET RID OF THINGS THAT WE DON'T NEED. OUT HERE, WE ALL USE THE SAME SORTS OF GOODS, SO THIS IS JUST A WAY FOR ALL OF US TO PUT TOGETHER WHAT WE HAVE AND HELP EACH OTHER OUT. LIGHTEN THE LOAD, BUT ALSO GET WHAT YOU NEED WITHOUT HAVING TO DEAL WITH BIG COSTS. I GOT A COUPLE OF BAGS OF HARDWOOD FIRE PELLETS. A NICE GRILL. I'VE GOT A 7.5 OUTBOARD MOTOR. ALL RIGHT. I MEAN, I THINK I'LL MAKE OUT ALL RIGHT TODAY. THERE WE GO. LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. LET'S GO, DORA. READY TO GO TO THE SWAP MEET? WE'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE YET. THIS IS RIDICULOUS. THIS SNOWMOBILE HAS BEEN NOTHING BUT TROUBLE. I MEAN, IT'S JUST SUCH A WASTE OF MONEY. YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING WITH IT. **** THE END OF WINTER ALSO BRINGS A YEARLY FESTIVAL IN YELLOWKNIFE AND A CHANCE FOR RANDY TO SHAKE OFF HIS CABIN FEVER BY PARTICIPATING IN AN EVENT MADE FOR THIS LAKE... ICE CARVING. HE'S TRAINED HIMSELF OVER A DECADE TO MASTER THIS CLASSIC NORTHERN ART. GREAT SLAVE LAKE HAS VERY NICE, CLEAR ICE, AND THE ICE FREEZES TO A THICKNESS OF FIVE FEET. SO YOU GET THESE MASSIVE ICE BLOCKS. THERE ARE ONLY A FEW PLACES IN THE WORLD THAT CAN PRODUCE ICE BLOCKS LIKE THAT, AND YELLOWKNIFE'S ONE OF THEM. EACH ONE OF THESE 5- TO 6-FOOT-THICK BLOCKS OF NATURAL GREAT SLAVE ICE WEIGHS UP TO 8,000 POUNDS. OVER 12 NATIONS HOLD ICE-CARVING COMPETITIONS, BUT YELLOWKNIFE'S IS ONE OF ONLY A FEW IN THE WORLD THAT USES PURE, UNPROCESSED BLOCKS FORGED BY MOTHER NATURE HERSELF. YELLOWKNIFE BAY HAS SOME OF THE BIGGEST ICE BLOCKS IN THE WORLD. I'VE BEEN ICE SCULPTING FOR 12 YEARS NOW WITH MY FRIEND JOHN. WHAT WE SHOULD DO IS JUST MAYBE SOMEHOW JUST CUT A THIN... A BLOCK HERE THAT WE CAN JUST REMOVE IT. WE WILL. ONE IMPORTANT JOB, AND THAT'S TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FOUNDATION OF THE SCULPTURE IS GONNA BE STRONG ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE THE STRESS THAT'S GONNA BE ON THE BLOCK ONCE WE FINISH OUR DESIGN. MANY PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THAT I'M AN ARTIST. I WORK WITH MY HANDS, YOU KNOW, AND I'M ABLE TO TAKE SOMETHING FROM MY MIND, HAVE AN IDEA, IMAGINE SOMETHING, AND THEN BE ABLE TO BRING IT ABOUT. THIS IS A COMPETITION, AND I KNOW THAT THOSE OTHER TEAMS ARE IN IT TO WIN IT. AND IN ORDER TO EDGE SOMEBODY OUT OR TO GET THE ELBOW ROOM TO COMPETE WITH THESE GUYS, YOU GOT TO BE ON THE BALL. OUTSIDE THEIR BOAT, STEPHAN AND ALLYCE ARE PACKED UP TO GO TO THE HOUSEBOATERS SWAP MEET, BUT EVEN FOR A QUICK TRIP JUST ACROSS THE BAY, STEPHAN'S 1980s SNOWMOBILE WON'T START YET AGAIN. WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS NOW? WANT TO CRANK? PULL. PULL. TRY AGAIN. GET ON! STEPH'S A SALESMAN. THIS IS HIS NICHE. HE LOVES TO BARTER WITH PEOPLE. HE'S REALLY GOOD AT IT. THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH STEPH IS HE THINKS EVERYTHING IS A TREASURE, SO TO KEEP HIM TO A LIMITED AMOUNT OF STUFF IS IMPORTANT, 'CAUSE I DON'T... I MEAN, WE DON'T HAVE STORAGE, SO I DON'T WANT TO END UP BRINGING MORE THAN WE TOOK. HEY, GARY. HOW ARE YOU? WOW, LOOK AT THAT FINE PILE OF STUFF. RIGHT? RIGHT WHEN WE PULL IN, HE COMES UP AND HE'S INTERESTED IN PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING THAT WE HAVE IN THE SNOWMOBILE, SO WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO BARTER REALLY WELL TODAY. LET'S SEE NOW. 7.5 TROLLING MOTOR. YEAH. MERCURY. HOW MANY ROCKS HAVE YOU HIT LATELY? NONE. NONE? NONE. LOOK AT THIS THING. THAT'S GOOD. IT'S IN GREAT SHAPE. WHAT'S ALL THAT? WHAT ELSE YOU GOT? PORTABLE BARBECUE. BARBECUE. THAT'S A NICE BARBECUE. I LIKE THAT ONE. IT'S A GREAT BARBECUE, MAN. WORKS LIKE A CHARM. HALF PRICE. NOT EVERYTHING CAN BE IN GREAT CONDITION. REGULATORS WORKS FINE. YEAH. IT'S AMAZING. AND COMES WITH A FULL TANK OF PROPANE. I'M JUST INTERESTED IN EVERYTHING YOU HAVE SO FAR. YEAH? YEAH. SO I BETTER DO MY BUSINESS QUICKLY. IF YOU WANT ANYTHING RIGHT NOW, WE SHOULD PROBABLY TALK. WELL, COME ON OVER TO THE STORE. SEE WHAT YOU GOT? YEAH. SEE WHAT I GOT. HERE'S SOMETHING THAT EVERYBODY'S INTERESTED IN. YOU GOT TO LIKE THIS ONE. THAT IS GORGEOUS. GARY'S SHOWING US A FEW THINGS THAT STEPH'S GETTING PRETTY INTERESTED IN, BUT THE FIRST THING THAT JUST BLOWS MY MIND IS THAT ICE AUGER. THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT I SPEND IN THE WINTER DRILLING THROUGH THE ICE JUST TO GET WATER. BUT THIS WILL JUST SAVE SO MUCH TIME AND SO MUCH ENERGY. I THINK YOUR EYES ARE BIGGER THAN YOUR SLED, THOUGH. BACK AT THE ICE-CARVING COMPETITION, RANDY'S ARTISTIC ESCAPE FROM LATE-WINTER CABIN FEVER... HE'S BEEN SLICING DOWN THE AUTOMOBILE-SIZED BLOCK OF NATURAL LAKE ICE ALL MORNING. BUT HIS VISION HAS YET TO TAKE SHAPE. THIS YEAR'S ICE-SCULPTURE DESIGN IS OF AN EAGLE SWOOPING DOWN TO PICK A TROUT OUT OF THE WATER WITH ITS TALONS. THIS DESIGN IS QUITE AMBITIOUS. I WAS THINKING I CAN EXAGGERATE THAT ANGLE, TOO. STICK IT OUT THAT WAY. YEAH. **** IT WOULD LOOK PRETTY **** WILD, MAN. WE'VE HAD REALLY STIFF COMPETITION. THEY'VE BEEN SENDING TEAMS UP HERE THAT DO NOTHING BUT SCULPT ICE ALL YEAR LONG, SO WE'RE AN UNDERDOG. WE'RE JUST GETTING READY TO FUSE THE TWO PIECES TOGETHER SO THAT WE CAN MAKE OUR SECOND WING TAKING OFF LIKE THAT. YOU'LL BE ABLE TO PICK IT UP FROM HERE? YEP. YOU THINK THIS STRAP CAN HOLD IT? IT SHOULD, YEAH. YEAH, IT SHOULD BE GOOD. OKAY. THIS IS THE RESULT OF A FRACTURE. JUST FRACTURING IN THE ICE THAT HAPPENS NATURALLY. YOU DON'T REALLY NECESSARILY KNOW WHEN IT'S GONNA COME AND BITE YOU, BUT IT OFTEN DOES. NATURAL ICE ALWAYS HAS IMPERFECTIONS IN IT THAT CAN CAUSE YOUR PIECE TO CRASH. EVEN THOUGH THERE'S A FRACTURE IN THE ICE BLOCK RANDY WANTS TO USE FOR THE TIP OF THE EAGLE'S WING, HE'S TAKING A CHANCE THAT THE OVER 2,000-POUND BLOCK HE'S LIFTING WON'T SPLIT APART AND CRUSH HIS ENTIRE SCULPTURE. ICE BLOCKS DON'T BOUNCE VERY WELL. I'M STRESSING OUT, MAN. THIS THING'S GONNA PICK UP THIS. WE GOT TO FUSE THESE TWO BIG ICE BLOCKS TOGETHER. IT'S A BIG JOB. WHOA. WHOA. ICE IS SO UNFORGIVING. IT'S VERY BRITTLE AND IT JUST... PKKK! JUST WHEN IT GOES, IT GOES. WHOA. WHOA. HOLD ON A SEC. ****! AS THE END OF WINTER APPROACHES, LAND DWELLERS AND HOUSEBOATERS IN YELLOWKNIFE ESCAPE CABIN FEVER BEFORE BREAK-UP BY GATHERING ON THE LAKE'S ICE FOR A FESTIVAL. I BALANCED HER PRETTY GOOD. RANDY IS A SURVIVALIST AND ICE-CARVING CHAMPION. YEP, KEEP GOING. HE'S ATTEMPTING TO STACK TWO HALVES OF A HUGE BLOCK OF ICE ON TOP OF ONE ANOTHER, AND HE'S GOT GOOD CAUSE TO BE WORRIED. LAST YEAR, AN ENTIRE PIECE WOUND UP CRASHING DOWN ON US. SO, YEAH, I'M NERVOUS. DOWN. DOWN. DOWN. LET'S SEE. WELL, LET'S GET IT STRAIGHTENED OUT. YEAH. IT'S A GOOD START. ACROSS THE BAY, "PIKE" MIKE IS GETTING READY TO TRADE AT THE SWAP MEET WITH A FEW ITEMS HE'S INVENTED DURING THE LONG WINTER NIGHTS. TIME OF YEAR HERE, THERE'S A LOT OF GLARE OFF THE ICE. GET A LOT OF SUNNY WEATHER. SUN SHINING MOST OF THE TIME. WHAT I HAVE IS A COUPLE OF ALUMINUM CAN BOTTOMS, AND I'VE CUT SLITS IN THEM TO CREATE THE SAME EFFECT TO REDUCE GLARE. WANT TO MAKE SURE THE SMOOTH SIDE IS ON THE INSIDE SO YOU DON'T SCRATCH YOUR SKIN. RIGHT. THESE, THEY'RE DESIGNED TO SHED THE PRECIPITATION THAT HITS IT, AS YOU CAN SEE, THE WAY THEY'RE DESIGNED. THEY COME IN DIFFERENT COLORS, DEPENDING ON THE COLOR OF THE CAN. THIS IS, YOU KNOW, DEPENDING ON YOUR OUTFIT. GOT ENOUGH GEAR TO TRADE WITH? I THINK SO. BACK AT THE SWAP MEET, STEPHAN AND ALLYCE ARE HOPING TO BARTER A SWEET DEAL FOR GARY'S GAS AUGER. BUT VETERAN HOUSEBOATER, GARY, KNOWS HE'S GOT THEM ON THE HOOK. SO, WE MIGHT WANT TO PUT THIS ASIDE AND NOT LET ANYBODY ELSE TAKE A LOOK AT IT. WELL, YOU KNOW, THERE'S OTHER PEOPLE COMING OVER TO HAVE A LOOK. YEAH. I LIKE THIS. I HEARD STEPHAN WAS GETTING MARRIED TO THE LOVELY ALLYCE, AND SHE'D PROBABLY LIKE A NICE ICE AUGER FOR A WEDDING PRESENT. SO, YOU TAKE THE AUGER AND THE ROPE FOR THE MOTOR? NO. NO. I'LL TAKE THE ROPE, THE AUGER, THAT FIRE PIT, AND THE DANFORTH ANCHOR FOR THE BOAT MOTOR AND THE FULL TANK OF GAS. HOW ABOUT THE SKI-DOO? YOU WANT MY SLED? WELL, I'LL TAKE THE WHOLE RIG. WHAT DO YOU WANT TO TRADE FOR THAT? EVERYTHING... THE MOTOR, THE SLED, THE SKI-DOO, THE WHOLE NINE YARDS, EVERYTHING. ON THE OTHER SIDE OF YELLOWKNIFE BAY, THE ICE-CARVING COMPETITORS ARE FINISHING THEIR SCULPTURES. BUT WITH ONLY MINUTES LEFT, RANDY'S SCULPTURE IS STILL INCOMPLETE. LAST 10 MINUTES OF THE COMPETITION, WE HAD TO FUSE THE HEAD ON, AND WE ACTUALLY HAD TO CARVE OUT THE INSIDE OF THE HEAD TO REDUCE SOME OF THE WEIGHT IN THE FRONT OF THE HEAD JUST SO THAT WE COULD ACTUALLY GET IT TO STAY THERE WHERE WE PUT IT. EACH WINTER, EXPERT CARVERS COME HERE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD TO COMPETE FOR MORE THAN $8,500 IN PRIZE MONEY AWARDED TO THE WINNING SCULPTURE. EVEN AFTER I HAD HOLLOWED THE HEAD OUT TO TRY TO REMOVE SOME OF THE WEIGHT, IT WAS STILL PRETTY HEAVY, SO I WAS REALLY HAPPY TO HAVE A HEAD WITH THAT. WATER. YOU KNOW, WHEN IT'S VERY, VERY COLD OUT AND YOU PUT A LITTLE BIT OF WATER IN, IT REALLY DOES ACT LIKE KRAZY GLUE AND IT STICKS REALLY GOOD. WELL, WHY DON'T YOU JUST GIVE US A LITTLE... I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING ANYWHERE. ...WARMER CLOTHING, AS OUR JUDGES DELIBERATE NOW. NOW THAT THE EAGLE HEAD IS ATTACHED, RANDY AND THE OTHER COMPETITORS ARE RUNNING OUT OF TIME TO COMPLETE THEIR SCULPTURES. I'M JUST GONNA GO WILD ON THIS THING. GET IT FINISHED AS FAST AS I CAN. THE CARVERS RUSH TO FINISH THEIR WORK, AND MISTAKES START HAPPENING. OUR NEXT DOOR NEIGHBORS' SCULPTURE SMASHED INTO A MILLION PIECES ON THE GROUND. WE JUST DIDN'T HAVE THE TIME TO PAY MUCH ATTENTION TO IT. WE WERE SO BUSY TRYING TO GET OUR PIECE DONE. **** PUT IT BACK ON. THE LAST 10 MINUTES OF THE COMPETITION, THE EAGLE'S CLAWS, WHICH ARE VERY FINE, DELICATE PARTS, I GOT CLUMSY AND KNOCKED ONE OF THOSE OFF, SO WE HAD TO REPAIR THAT QUICKLY. **** JOHN. **** I JUST KNOCKED THIS **** THING OFF. I WENT TO STAND UP AND I ACCIDENTALLY BUMPED THE EAGLE'S HEAD AND HIS HEAD FELL OFF. CARVERS, YOU GOT THREE MINUTES! THREE MINUTES. I'LL GRAB BILL AGAIN. BILL! BILL! WHEN THE HEAD DECIDED TO FALL OFF AND THERE WAS ONLY TWO MINUTES LEFT TO GO, I FIGURED WE WERE IN BIG TROUBLE. **** IT'S THE END OF WINTER ON GREAT SLAVE LAKE. WITH ONLY A FEW DAYS LEFT BEFORE THIS FROZEN LAND TURNS BACK INTO SUBARCTIC WATERS... ...RANDY SIBBESTON IS IN THE FINAL MOMENTS OF AN ICE-CARVING COMPETITION... **** JOHN. **** ...WHEN HIS EAGLE SCULPTURE BREAKS INTO PIECES. I JUST KNOCKED THIS **** THING OFF. WHEN THE HEAD DECIDED TO FALL OFF, I FIGURED WE WERE IN BIG TROUBLE. ONE MINUTE, CARVERS! YOU GOT ONE MINUTE! OKAY. OKAY, WE NEED SLUSH, MAN. CAN SOMEBODY GRAB ME A BIT OF SNOW? **** WE NEED LOTS, MAN. JOHN REALIZED THAT THERE WAS NO SLUSH LEFT IN THE BUCKET, SO I WAS YELLING AT JOHN, "GET SOME SLUSH! GET SOME MORE SNOW!" WHEN YOU'RE FUSING TWO PIECES OF ICE, YOU HAVE TO HOLD THE PIECE TOGETHER PERFECTLY STILL AND THEN PUT SLUSH INTO THE CRACK, AND THEN WAIT FOR IT TO HARDEN SO THAT IT CAN STICK AND STAY WHERE YOU PUT IT. THIS SIDE HAS A HUGE GAP. 15 SECONDS! FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE! TIME! ALL TOOLS DOWN! LET GO OF THE ICE! I WAS HOLDING IT STILL THERE, WAITING FOR THE SLUSH TO FREEZE SO THAT I COULD LET GO OF IT. RANDY'S GOT TO LET GO. TELL HIM HE'S GOT TO LET GO. RANDY, YOU HAVE TO LET GO. I HAD NO IDEA IF IT WAS GOING TO STAY. RANDY, LET GO. AT THE HOUSEBOATERS SWAP MEET, HEATED NEGOTIATIONS ARE UNDERWAY AS GARY TRIES TO WRESTLE STEPHAN'S SNOWMOBILE AWAY FROM HIM IN EXCHANGE FOR A BRAND-NEW POWER AUGER. I'LL TAKE THE WHOLE RIG. WHAT DO YOU WANT TO TRADE FOR THAT? EVERYTHING... THE MOTOR, THE SLED, THE SKI-DOO, THE WHOLE NINE YARDS, EVERYTHING. LIFE'S ALL ABOUT COMPROMISE. GARY'S GOT HIS EYES ON MY 7.5 OUTBOARD MOTOR. HOUSEBOATERS ARE PROBABLY THE BEST HAGGLERS I'VE EVER COME ACROSS. ALLYCE WANTS THAT AUGER. I WANT HER TO HAVE THAT AUGER. I GOT HIM RIGHT WHERE I WANT HIM. OKAY, OKAY. HOLD ON. HOLD ON. LET ME COME BACK AT YOU. LET ME COME BACK AT YOU. THE AUGER, ROPE. YEAH. THE FIRE PIT, THE DANFORTH. YEAH. THOSE TWO FLOATIES. YEAH. AND THAT CABLE YOU TOLD ME WILL NEVER RUST. LIKE I SAID, I'M IN A PERFECT POSITION RIGHT NOW. THAT'S MY SLED! THAT'S 600 BUCKS ALL DAY LONG! ALL RIGHT, DEAL. IS THAT A DEAL? DEAL. RIGHT ON, GARY! ALL RIGHT. GOOD STUFF. GOOD STUFF. RIGHT ON. AT THE END OF THE DAY, I LOST MY SLED. ALLYCE, YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE WHAT I GOT. I'M WORRIED NOW. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, I'VE GOT THAT GAS-POWERED AUGER FOR MY FUTURE WIFE. YOU'RE GONNA BE HAPPY, HON. YOU MIGHT NOT BE. THIS SLED AIN'T OURS ANYMORE. HEY, GOOD THINGS COME. I CAN'T BELIEVE GARY WENT FOR IT, BUT WE GOT RID OF THE SNOWMOBILE. THIS THING HAS BEEN A HEADACHE SINCE DAY ONE. GOT MY AUGER. THAT'S ALL I CARE ABOUT. GOT YOUR AUGER. ARE YOU HAPPY ABOUT THE AUGER A LITTLE BIT? YES, I'M HAPPY ABOUT THE AUGER. JUST A LITTLE BIT, YEAH? MAYBE? YEAH? I'M SO HAPPY. IT'S MOVED ON AND WE CAN FOCUS ON THE FUTURE. - HEY, MIKE. - HEY, MIKE. WHAT HAVE WE GOT HERE? YEAH. SO, PIKE MIKE PULLS UP WITH A CANOE FULL OF GOODIES. TONS OF GREAT STUFF. - GOOD PAIR OF SKATES. - YEAH. SOME FISHING EQUIPMENT. STEPHAN WASN'T HOLDING HIS CARDS TOO CLOSE TO HIS CHEST. AS SOON AS I PULLED UP, STEPHAN'S EYES WENT RIGHT ON THAT GUITAR, AND I KNEW HE WAS MINE. YOU'RE PLAYING THAT REAL WELL, MY FRIEND. YOU LIKE IT? I LOVE IT. THIS IS A DANELECTRO GUITAR THAT I'VE WANTED SINCE I WAS 17 YEARS OLD, AND IT'S GONNA BE MINE. I'VE GOT TO LOOK AROUND, SEE WHAT YOU'VE GOT. I CAN TELL STEPH'S IN LOVE WITH THAT GUITAR. WE'RE NOT PULLING AWAY HERE TODAY WITHOUT IT. I GOT A TON OF STUFF. LET ME SHOW YOU. LET'S HAVE A LOOK. IT'S SUCH A FREAKING LONG WINTER. A FIND LIKE THIS CAN ALLOW SOMEONE PEACE. I WANT THAT GUITAR. THIS YOUR GEAR HERE? YEAH, MAN. ALL RIGHT. COUPLE BAGS OF PELLETS. THERE'S SOME VALUE THERE. YOU GOT A CHAIN FALL HERE. IF YOU TRADE YOUR THINGS RIGHT, MIGHT BE YOURS. WE'RE ACTUALLY WINCHING MY BOAT UP. IT'LL HANDLE UP TO 3,000 POUNDS. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'LL DO. THE TWO PELLET BAGS, THAT EXPANDED STEEL GRILL, AND THE COME-ALONG JACK FOR THE GUITAR. NO DEAL. NO DEAL? NOPE. STILL NO DEAL. NO WAY. YOU BALL-BREAKING SON OF A BITCH. I SHOWED MIKE RIGHT AWAY THAT I WANTED THAT GUITAR... THROW IN THE HERC STRAPS? I WILL THROW IN THE HERC STRAPS. ...AND HE TOOK ME FOR WAY MORE THAN HE SHOULD HAVE. DEAL. DEAL, MAN. DEAL. THANKS, MIKE. I'M PLEASED. ME, TOO. I COULDN'T BE MORE PLEASED, LET ME TELL YOU. I THINK WE BOTH WON ON THIS ONE. THANK YOU. NO LOSERS IN THIS DEAL. GOT IT. WHOO-HOO! WHERE'S YOU SLEIGH? I'LL HELP YOU LUG IT OVER THERE. CAN'T WAIT TO PLAY THAT GUITAR. TIME HAS JUST BEEN CALLED TO END THE ICE-CAVING COMPETITION. BUT RANDY'S SCULPTURE IS IN TROUBLE. RANDY'S GOT TO LET GO. TELL HIM HE'S GOT TO LET GO. RANDY, YOU HAVE LET GO. I WAS STANDING THERE, HOLDING THE HEAD ON, WAITING FOR IT TO FREEZE 'CAUSE YOU HAVE TO HOLD IT REALLY STILL WHILE IT FREEZES. AND I WAS HOLDING IT AS STILL AS I COULD, AND IT'S HEAVY, AND I'M STARTING TO SHAKE. AND THE JUDGE IS YELLING AT ME, SAYING, YOU KNOW, "WORK IS OVER. GET YOUR HANDS OFF THE SCULPTURE." RANDY, NOTHING CAN TOUCH IT. NOTHING CAN TOUCH IT UNTIL, YOU KNOW, IT'S JUDGED. I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA LET IT GO, AND IT WAS JUST GONNA FALL OFF, BUT I LET IT GO, AND IT STAYED THERE, SO JUST STEPPED BACK AND SAID, "THANK YOU, LORD," BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW IF IT WAS GONNA STAY THERE OR NOT. GRAB YOUR TOOLS SO THE JUDGES CAN GET IN AND JUDGE THE SITE. AT THE END OF THE DAY, WE CAME IN THIRD PLACE. BUT TO ME, JUST TO SEE THAT PIECE STANDING THERE, THAT WAS A VICTORY ALL ITS OWN. THE PEOPLE OF THIS LAND, THEY FEEL LIKE THEY'RE A PART OF NATURE. LIVING ON THE WATER IS ONE WAY FOR ME TO GET AS CLOSE AS I CAN TO THE LITTLE PIECE OF HEAVEN THAT I WANT. IT'S A GREAT QUALITY OF LIFE. WHAT A BEAUTIFUL DAY FOR THE LAKE GAMES? THE LAKE GAMES ARE JUST TO GET US TOGETHER AND HAVE FUN. GO! PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD SKILLS... THE TOBOGGAN RACE, AX THROWING. THIS AX TOSS, I WOULD BE VERY, VERY CONFIDENT ABOUT. **** YOU GOT TO AUGER A HOLE, SPLIT SOME WOOD, AND GET A FIRE GOING. THRILL OF VICTORY, THE AGONY OF DEFEAT. NO! THIS IS GONNA TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF WORK. WE'RE GONNA HAVE A REALLY NICE CHAIR, AND WE CAN USE IT IN THE RESTAURANT. THIS IS GREAT. IT'S THE END OF WINTER, AND AFTER SIX MONTHS OF BITTER COLD, MOLLY AND GARY ARE ON THE DECK OF THE MOLLY BARGE, ENJOYING THE DAY WHILE REPAIRING ESSENTIAL ITEMS FOR THEIR FLOATING RESTAURANT. HEY, OLD MAN. HOLY... JOHN! I GOT MY HEAD DOWN, AND I HEAR THIS VOICE. AND FOR ALL THE LIFE OF ME, THAT SOUNDED LIKE MY FRIEND JOHN ALEXANDER. SO, YOU JUST GET IN TODAY? YEAH. I WAS EXPECTING SOMEBODY ELSE. I WANTED TO SEE THE EXPRESSION YOUR FACE, MAN. YOU DID? WELL, YOU SAW IT. JOHN ALEXANDER IS AN OLD FRIEND OF MINE. BACK IN THE BEGINNING, WHEN IT WAS JUST TWO HOUSEBOATS, I OWNED ONE, AND SO DID HE. YOU KNOW, YOU'VE BEEN SAYING YOU'RE COMING UP HERE FOR YEARS. WELL, I HAD TO COME UP AND SEE WHAT YOU WERE UP TO, YOU SEE. GARY'S BEEN BUGGING ME FOR YEARS TO COME BACK UP AND SEE THE OLD STOMPING GROUNDS, AND I COULDN'T RESIST. SO I THOUGHT I'D SURPRISE THE OLD BOY AND JUST SHOW UP. WOW. HAS THIS PLACE CHANGED, OR WHAT? CAN I GET YOU GUYS SOME COFFEE? THAT WOULD BE WONDERFUL, MY DEAR. IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK. HEY, I BROUGHT SOMETHING TO SHOW YOU. YEAH? YEAH, I BROUGHT A PIECE OF THE OLD DAYS WITH ME. YOU'RE GONNA LOVE THIS. I DOCUMENTED THAT WHOLE OPERATION. I HAVE NONE OF THESE. THIS IS AMAZING. REMEMBER THE MINERS HAD A POOL GOING ON US, WHETHER THE TWO HIPPIES WOULD FINISH THE JUMP. NOBODY BELIEVED IN HIPPIES BACK THEN. ABOUT 30 YEARS AGO, PRICES FOR APARTMENTS IN YELLOWKNIFE WERE RIDICULOUS, SO THE BRILLIANT IDEA WAS BORN... WHY NOT GO OUT ON THE WATER AND BUILD HOUSEBOATS? THIS ROOM, ALL THESE BOARDS, CAME FROM THIS BUILDING. GARY CAME UP WITH THE BRILLIANT IDEA THAT WE SHOULD BUY ONE OF THE OLD, ABANDONED BUNKHOUSES OUT AT GIANT MINE. SO FOR THE INCREDIBLE PRICE OF $1, WE GOT ENOUGH LUMBER FROM THAT BUILDING TO BUILD MY HOUSEBOAT AND GARY'S HOUSEBOAT. COOL? AND THERE'S THE ORIGINAL BARREL BARGES THAT WE WERE MAKING ON THE ICE. AND THEN THERE'S PUTTING IT ON. WE SLID IT OVER ONTO THIS BARGE, WHICH IS ON THE WATER. WE STARTED OUT WITH 45-GALLON DRUMS AND PUT RAFTS TOGETHER AND BUILT HOUSES ON THEM. THOSE WERE THE FIRST HOUSEBOATS. AND THAT'S WHAT THE VERY FIRST LITTLE HOUSEBOAT COMMUNITY... THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE WHEN WE STARTED. THAT'S COOL. YOU SEE WE SUCCEEDED. I MEAN, THERE'S 42 OF THEM OUT THERE. THOSE ARE COOL. I'LL GET LUNCH READY, OKAY? LET'S GO. I WANT TO GO SEE MY OLD STOMPING GROUNDS. WATCH THAT. NOW, YOU REMEMBER, JOHN. CAN YOU BELIEVE WHAT THIS HAS ALL TURNED INTO? LOOK AT THIS. I'M AMAZED AT HOW IT'S GROWN. THEY'RE PRETTY COOL? HOUSEBOATING, FOR ME, IS GONNA BE ONE OF THE MEMORIES OF MY LIFE. AFTER 30 YEARS, I KIND OF LOOK BACK ON IT, AND I THINK IT'S BECOME A PART OF MY LEGACY HERE. YEAH, THERE IT IS, JOHN. YOU CAN'T BELIEVE HOW MANY PEOPLE YOU'VE INSPIRED WITH THAT CURVED ROOF. EVERYBODY WANTS TO TRY THAT OUT. WE HAD NO IDEA WHEN THERE WAS ONLY TWO OF US OUT HERE THAT IT WOULD EVER EXPAND. WHO ELSE WANTED TO LIVE ON HOUSEBOATS? BUT NOW, WHEN YOU LOOK AROUND, THERE'S 40 OF THEM. WE WANTED TO BRING IT OUT ON THE WATER, AND IT ALL STARTED THERE. KIND OF A QUIET REVOLUTION. YEAH, A REVOLUTION. A REVOLUTION. I THINK A BOTTLE OF RUM HELPED THAT IDEA. PROBABLY MORE THAN ONE, YEAH. I THINK SO. HAVING JOHN BACK ON THE LAKE JUST FELT GREAT. IT WAS ALMOST LIKE WE WERE DOING IT AGAIN FOR THE FIRST TIME. YOU AND I, JOHN. WE HAD NO IDEA WHAT WE STARTED. YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS, TOO? PEOPLE ARE NOW LOOKING AT US AS WISE ELDERS BECAUSE WE DID THIS. IT'S GREAT. YES. WE ARE SO WISE. HOUSEBOATING, FOR ME, IS GONNA BE ONE OF THE BIGGEST MEMORIES OF MY LIFE, AND I AT LEAST HAVE THESE INCREDIBLE STORIES I CAN TELL ABOUT THE DAYS ON THE OPEN WATER. LET'S GO GET SOME LUNCH. COME ON. HELL OF AN IDEA. ANOTHER END-OF-WINTER TRADITION TO BRING THE COMMUNITY TOGETHER IS THE ICE LAKE GAMES. WHAT A BEAUTIFUL DAY FOR THE LAKE GAMES? YEAH. IT'S GORGEOUS OUT. THE LAKE GAMES ARE JUST A SMALL ASSORTMENT OF DIFFERENT COMPETITIONS, REALLY JUST TO GET US TOGETHER AND HAVING FUN. SPRING IS HERE, BABY. IN THE SPRING, WHEN WE GET MORE SUN AND MORE HEAT, WE'RE JUST GETTING THROUGH CABIN FEVER. WE WANT TO GO OUT THERE AND PLAY SOME GAMES TOGETHER, ENJOY THE ICE BEFORE IT FALLS OUT FROM BENEATH OUR FEET. ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO WIN THESE GAMES. TRUE TO FORM, "PIKE" MIKE HAS PLANS TO INVENT HIS WAY TO A WIN IN THE TOBOGGAN PULL. YEAH, YOU WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO BRING PEOPLE CLOSE TOGETHER, THROW AN EVENT, HAVE SOME RECREATION. AND WE REALLY ENJOY OUR LAKE GAMES. WELL, THERE IT IS. THIS WILL BE THE FASTED SLED IN THIS AFTERNOON'S TOBOGGAN RACE. THE STOOL TURNS IT INTO A KICK SLED. YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE THE STOOL ON HERE, 'CAUSE THIS IS WHAT'S GIVING YOU STABILITY. BUT AS A VERY LIGHT, STREAMLINED RACING TOBOGGAN, THE STOOL COMES OFF. I GOT TO STAY STREAMLINED DOWN LIKE THIS 'CAUSE WE'RE GONNA WIN THIS RACE. THE ICE LAKE GAMES ARE SET TO BEGIN, AND JOHN ALEXANDER, ELDER OF THE LAKE, HAS BEEN CHOSEN TO JUDGE THE EVENT. WELCOME TO THE ANNUAL LAKE GAMES. WINTER IS OVER, SPRING IS ON THE WAY, AND THE LAKE GAMES WILL PROBABLY BE THE LAST TIME TO GET TOGETHER BEFORE BREAK-UP. THE HOUSE-BOATERS ARE DIVIDED INTO TWO-PERSON TEAMS, AND THEY'RE READY TO COMPETE. TEAM STEPHAN AND ALLYCE. THANK YOU, JOHN. AND TEAM RYAN AND "PIKE" MIKE. Y'ALL MIGHT AS WELL CONCEDE NOW. WE'VE DONE A LOT OF PREPARATION FOR THIS. RYAN IS STEPHAN'S BEST FRIEND, BUT TODAY, HE'S BEEN RECRUITED AS "PIKE" MIKE'S SECRET WEAPON. "PIKE" MIKE HAS AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE HAVING RYAN. BUT I'VE GOT MY NUMBER-ONE. I'VE GOT ALLYCE. AND WE'RE GOOD TO GO. LAST BUT NOT LEAST, SIR, TEAM RANDY. RANDY, ARE YOU PLAYING THE GAMES ALONE? RANDY IS A CANADIAN RANGER AND AN EXPERT IN SURVIVAL SKILLS, SO HE'LL BE COMPETING SOLO AS HIS HANDICAP. I'VE BEEN IN THESE TYPES OF COMPETITIONS IN THE PAST. ALL THE HOUSE-BOATERS, THEY JUST LOVE BEING OUTSIDE AND DOING STUFF, AND THIS IS REALLY GREAT WAY FOR EVERYBODY TO GET TOGETHER AND TO, YOU KNOW, SHOW OFF THEIR SKILLS AND HAVE A GOOD, FUN TIME OF TRYING TO OUTDO EACH OTHER AT THESE EVENTS. OKAY, LET'S HAVE SPORTSMANSHIP HERE, BECAUSE THE WINNER OF THIS ILLUSTRIOUS EVENT WILL WIN AN ANTIQUE YELLOWKNIFE TEAPOT. YOU NEED ONE OF THOSE. YEAH! THE COPPER TEAPOT IS ALSO A YELLOWKNIFE NATIVE, AS YELLOWKNIFE GOT ITS NAME FROM THE MANY COPPER MINES FIRST ESTABLISHED HERE. THERE MAY BE SURPRISES INSIDE. OOH. MAY THE BEST HUMANOID WIN. THE OPENING GAME OF THE TOURNAMENT IS A PEOPLE-POWERED TOBOGGAN RACE ACROSS THE ICE. TEAMS, TO THE START LINE. WELL, THE TOBOGGAN PULL... PUT A LOT OF PREPARATION INTO THAT. WE WERE REALLY CONFIDENT. I'M A GAZELLE, MAN. I CAN RUN. ALLYCE CALLS ME FREAKISHLY FAST. I GOT THIS. WELCOME TO THE TOBOGGAN PULL. YOU WILL RACE TO THAT BLUE BARREL, GO AROUND THE BLUE BARREL. YOU WILL RACE BACK. THE FIRST TEAM CROSSING THIS LINE WINS. READY? SET. GO! MUSH! **** SIX MONTHS OF WINTER IS ENDING, BUT BEFORE BREAK-UP TAKES OVER THE LAKE... TEAMS, TO THE START LINE. ...THE HOUSE-BOATERS ARE HAVING ONE LAST BLAST... THEIR ANNUAL ICE LAKE GAMES. WE'VE GOT THIS ONE. STEPH'S A CRAZY-FAST RUNNER. WE CAN DO THIS. WE'RE GONNA COME IN FIRST. THIS TOBOGGAN RACE IS THE FIRST EVENT OF THE DAY FOR THESE HUMAN SLED DOGS TO ESCAPE THEIR CABIN FEVER. RANDY IS PULLING ALONE, SO HIS TOBOGGAN IS WEIGHTED DOWN WITH BAGS OF FIREWOOD. READY? SET. GO! STEPHAN AND ALLYCE ARE OUT OF THE GATE LIKE A RACEHORSE TEAM. BUT MY GUY, HE'S JUST... LIKE, I CAN FEEL THE ACCELERATION. **** MOVE! NO! WE FELL, AND THERE WAS NO GOING BACK FROM THERE. AND THEN, OUT OF FREAKING NOWHERE, RYAN WITH A SANTA CLAUS ONESIE STARTS PULLING AHEAD OF ME. "PIKE" MIKE... HIS DUMB DESIGN IS GRADE-A. SO WHAT DO I DO? I BRING OUT THE SPEED. TURN IT UP, STEPH! TURN IT UP! I'M GIVING HER ALL I GOT, AND HE'S STILL PULLING AHEAD OF ME. WE HAVE IT. ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS NOT WIPE OUT AROUND THE TURN. IT WAS A LOT LIKE RIDING WITH A THOROUGHBRED, THE MUSHER AND THE LEAD DOG. HAH! HAH, HORSE! RIGHT OVER THE FINISH LINE! WAY TO RACE HARD, GARY. IT WAS ONLY THE EQUIPMENT? I GOT A GOOD HORSE, TOO. WE DO THE LAKE GAMES BECAUSE YOU CAN ACTUALLY BE OUTSIDE AND ENJOY YOURSELF. AND WHAT BETTER TIME THAN TO GET TOGETHER WITH FRIENDS IN THE COMMUNITY AND HAVE A LITTLE RIVALRY. I MEAN, WE JUST WANT TO HAVE SOME FUN BEFORE THE ICE BREAKS UP. THE NEXT CONTEST WE HAD WAS AN AXE-THROWING CONTEST. FOR THE AX THROW, EACH HOUSE-BOATER GETS THREE CHANCES TO POP THE BALLOON WITH AN AX. BUT MOLLY, WHO'S NEWEST TO THE LAKE, MIGHT BE IN OVER HER HEAD. I HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO THROW AN AX. MY CONFIDENCE LEVEL ISN'T THAT HIGH. MOLLY, THE AX MURDERER. PRETTY GOOD TECHNIQUE, THERE. MOVE TO THE LEFT A LITTLE BIT. CORRECT YOURSELF. YOU ARE MONEY. YOU ARE MONEY ALL DAY LONG, SWEETHEART. WINNER! DAMN IT. AX THROWING DIDN'T GO SO WELL. IT'S ON YOU, HON. THIS AX TOSS, I WOULD BE VERY, VERY CONFIDENT ABOUT. **** **** COULDN'T GET ON THE BOARD. COULDN'T GET ON THE BOARD. VERY FEW AXES ACTUALLY PENETRATED, BUT ACCURACY WON THE DAY. BIG MONEY! NO WHAMMY! I MANAGED TO BURST THE BALLOON, AND BANG, I PUT IT RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE AND POPPED THE BALLOON. THAT WAS A GOOD FEELING. HE MAY HAVE WON THIS ROUND, BUT IT'S HOCKEY TIME. THE THIRD EVENT IS THE HOCKEY SHOOTOUT, WHERE EACH TEAM USES A STICK AND PUCK TO TRY AND KNOCK DOWN THE MOST CANS. PLAYED A BIT OF HOCKEY IN MY TIME. WORKED ON MY SHOT OVER THE YEARS. "PIKE" MIKE! "PIKE" MIKE! WOW! BEST WRIST-SHOT EVER. YOU GET BONUS POINTS FOR THAT. STEPHAN, YOU'RE NEXT. MWAH! THIS IS THE HOCKEY SHOOTOUT. THIS IS WHERE I'VE GOT SOME WRIST. I'VE GOT SOME LIFT. I'VE GOT SOME SLAP SHOTS. AW, COME ON. NICE SHOOTING THERE, TEX. EVERY PROUD CANADIAN SHOULD KNOW HOW TO KNOCK CANS OFF WITH A HOCKEY STICK AND A PUCK. ALLYCE. YOU GOT THE TECHNIQUE. LIKE EGGS OUT OF THE FRYING PAN. I'M NOT SO GOOD AT GETTING IT UP IN THE AIR, SO I'M A LITTLE WORRIED. IT LOOKS PRETTY TOUGH. THAT WAS SUCH A GOOD HIT. HEY, WE'RE DOWN TO OVERTIME. MAKE THE LAST SHOT COUNT. THE SCORE IS EVEN, AND IF "PIKE" MIKE HITS DOWN ONE MORE, HE'LL BE THE WINNER. YOU GOT THIS, MIKE. COME ON. CONGRATULATIONS. THANK YOU, MAN. YOU DID AN ADEQUATE JOB. THANK YOU. THANK YOU, JUDGE. THE FINAL GAME OF THE DAY IS A NORTHERN TRADITIONAL EVENT KNOWN AS TEA BOILING. GO, GO, GO. COME ON. HOLD ON. LET ME GET MY HAND ON TOP. SO, WE GOT THE TEA BOILING COMPETITION. PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD SKILLS. SLUSH IT. SLUSH IT UP. DOWN, DOWN, DOWN. YOU GOT TO AUGER A HOLE, YOU GOT TO FILL YOUR CUP WITH WATER, SPLIT SOME WOOD, AND GET A FIRE GOING USING FLINT. OKAY, GET THE CAN. GET THE CAN. AND THEN YOU FINALLY BOIL SOME TEA. **** THEY'RE ALREADY THROUGH. **** CHEATER **** OKAY. GET THE WATER, BRO. COME ON! **** I LOOK OVER AT "PIKE" MIKE AND RYAN, AND THEY'RE IN. FIRST ONES THROUGH THE ICE. GOOD, GOOD, GOOD, GOOD, GOOD. I GOT IT. GARY AND MOLLY... OKAY, 1, 2, 3. ...THESE GUYS ARE AUGERING LIKE THERE'S NO TOMORROW. THEY'VE GOT THE WATER. THEY'RE STARTING ON THEIR FIRE. RANDY... DONE. THESE ARE **** TWO-YEAR-OLD BLADES! WE'RE **** WATCH OUT, WATCH OUT, WATCH OUT. **** I'VE MADE A LOT OF FIRES IN MY DAY UNDER TOUGH CONDITIONS AND UNDER A LITTLE BIT OF PRESSURE SOMETIMES, TOO. SO NOTHING NEW TO ME, I GUESS. MAYBE I HAD A LITTLE ADVANTAGE THAT WAY. COME ON. THAT'S SMOKE. WHERE THERE'S SMOKE, THERE'S FIRE. THE FIRE-BUILDING WAS PRETTY TOUGH. I HADN'T USED A FLINT BEFORE. THIS IS GREEN. IT WAS INTERESTING WITH THE AX GETTING ALL THESE LITTLE SPARKS, BUT NOTHING'S CATCHING. THIS ISN'T GONNA WORK. YOU GOT ANY PAPER? THEY CAN'T DO THAT. THAT'S CHEATING. GEEZ, YOU'RE GETTING A GOOD SPARK. WE'RE LIKE MAKING FIREWORKS, WE HAD SO MUCH SPARK GOING. WE COULD HAVE SPENT A LITTLE MORE TIME BUILDING A BETTER TINDER PILE. BIRCH BARK, BIRCH BARK, BIRCH BARK. RANDY... THIS GUY'S SHARP. RANDY DECIDES TO LAY HIS JACKET DOWN. HE STARTS SHAVING MAGNESIUM INTO A PILE. THAT WAS THE KEY. STEPH. KEEP DOING WHAT YOU'RE DOING, I'LL KEEP DOING WHAT I'M DOING. WE'RE GONNA WIN THIS. OKAY, SHE'S HOT, BABY. SHE'S HOT. NOW I'M ACTUALLY VERY, VERY IMPRESSED WITH MYSELF. I LOOK OVER, NOBODY ELSE HAS GOT A FIRE BUT RANDY. SO NOW IT'S ME AND RANDY. ME AND RANDY ALL THE WAY. LOOK AT THAT. LOOK AT THAT. IT'S GONNA BOIL ANY SECOND. GETTING THERE? IT'S COMING. IT'S COMING. THERE YOU GO. YOU HAVE A ROLLING BOIL. YOU GOT IT. CONGRATULATIONS. THANK YOU. WE'RE BOILING! WE'RE BOILING! WE'RE BOILING! WE'RE BOILING HERE, BOSS! COME ON, HURRY UP! **** WHOA! JOHN! ON THE EVER-THINNING ICE OF GREAT SLAVE LAKE, CANADIAN RANGER RANDY IS THE OVERALL WINNER OF THE HOUSE-BOATERS ICE LAKE GAMES. BUT THE DAY IS FAR FROM OVER. ROLLING BOIL. YOU GOT IT. CONGRATULATIONS. THANK YOU. WE'RE BOILING! WE'RE BOILING! WE'RE BOILING! WE'RE BOILING HERE, BOSS! COME ON, HURRY UP! WHOA! JOHN! YOU DON'T WANT TO FALL IN THIS WATER. YOU HAVE SECONDS TO GET OUT. I GOT YOU, I GOT YOU, I GOT YOU. YOU CAN'T BREATHE. JUST THE SHOCK OF THE WATER, IT TAKES YOUR BREATH AWAY, AND YOU JUST PANIC. MEDIC! MANY PEOPLE HAVE DIED IN THIS LAKE. I GOT YOU, I GOT YOU, I GOT YOU. WITHOUT WARNING, A THIN SPOT ON THE ICE TAKES THE VETERAN HOUSE-BOATER IN ITS GRIP... - YOU OKAY, JOHN? - MY GOD. ...A STARK REMINDER THAT CELEBRATION ON THE ICE CAN BE SHORT-LIVED, AND THAT THE LAKE IS ALWAYS IN CONTROL. WE'VE NEVER LOST A HOUSE-BOATER. WE'RE LOST A COUPLE OF, UM, SORT OF CIVILIANS, IF YOU WILL. BUT WE NEVER LOST A HOUSE-BOATER. FOR THE HOUSE-BOATERS, JOHN FALLING THROUGH IS A TELLTALE SIGN THAT THE ICE WHICH HOLDS THEM UP IS SLOWLY CRUMBLING UNDER THEIR FEET. ONCE YOU START GETTING TOO CONFIDENT WITH THE ICE, THAT'S WHEN IT GETS DANGEROUS. I'M NOT GONNA HEAR THE END OF THIS FOR A LONG, LONG TIME. WELL, YOUR HAND LOOKS LIKE IT WENT THROUGH THE WRINGER, THERE. ALONG THE SIDE HERE, AND... REALLY? YEAH, SEE A LITTLE BIT THERE. JUST ANOTHER WAR WOUND. WELL, BREAK-UP'S COMING PRETTY SOON, AND IT'S QUITE DANGEROUS. THIS IS SERIOUS BUSINESS, WHEN YOU FALL THROUGH THE ICE.
