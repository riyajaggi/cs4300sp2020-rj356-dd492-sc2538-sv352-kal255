 AT THE EDGE OF THE ARCTIC... ...A GROUP OF REBELS HAVE CHOSEN TO LIVE COMPLETELY OFF THE GRID. LIVING OFF THE GRID IS GREAT, BUT THERE ARE SO MANY CHALLENGES, ESPECIALLY IN WINTER. I CAN BARELY FEEL MY FINGERS RIGHT NOW. IT'S JUST REALLY, REALLY COLD. IN THE WAKE OF A BRUTAL WINTER STORM AND MONTHS OF SEVERE CONDITIONS STILL AHEAD... BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A COLD WINTER, EVEN THE FISH ARE GOING DEEPER. THAT MEANS WE GOT TO GO FURTHER TO BE ABLE TO CATCH THOSE FISH.

 ...SUPPLIES RUN LOW. WE'RE OUT HERE TODAY PULLING THESE NETS, HOPING WE CAN FILL OUR FREEZERS. REPLENISHING AND PROTECTING THEIR FOOD STORES... WHAT'S THAT? ...BECOMES A LIFE-THREATENING GAMBLE. WE DON'T HUNT FOR SPORT OUT HERE. WE HUNT FOR SURVIVAL. IT'S BETWEEN US AND HIM. IT'S THE DEAD OF WINTER ON GREAT SLAVE LAKE, WHERE EVERYTHING LIVING THING THAT CAN SURVIVE HERE IS HUNGRY. WINTERS CAN BE VERY HARD, DIFFICULT SOMETIMES. WINTERS ARE LONG AND COLD AND DARK. FOR THOSE WHO MISCALCULATED THEIR NEEDS

 OR WERE UNLUCKY ENOUGH TO RUN OUT OF PROVISIONS, NOW IS THE TIME TO REPLENISH THEIR RESERVES. IN THE LULL BETWEEN SNOWSTORMS, THEY WILL HAVE TO HUNT AND FISH FOR WHAT THEY NEED HERE ON THIS DESOLATE ICE LAKE. NATURE REQUIRES THAT WE ARE ABLE TO THINK AHEAD AND TO PLAN AHEAD. ON THE NORTHERN ARM OF THE LAKE, IN THE MIDDLE OF BEAR COUNTRY, RAGNAR WESSTROM AND HIS ASSISTANT, CHEF RON, STORED ALL OF THEIR PROVISIONS IN THE FALL, AND THEY ARE NOW PREPARING TO OPEN THEIR WILDERNESS LODGE TO INTERNATIONAL FISHING CLIENTS. WE GOT BERLIN. STOCKHOLM... 5,880 KILOMETERS. YOU KNOW STOCKHOLM IS ON THE SAME LATITUDE AS YELLOWKNIFE? PARIS... NOBODY WANTS TO GO THERE. BUT WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO WITH THESE? I'M GOING TO PUT IT UP LIKE YOU SEE IN THE MOVIES, GONNA HAVE ALL THE ARROWS POINTING IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION TO THE DIFFERENT CITIES. SEPARATED FROM THE OTHER LAKE DWELLERS, THEY SURVIVE ON THEIR OWN. WE'RE THE ONLY LODGE ON THE NORTH ARM, SO WE'RE QUITE ISOLATED. TO BUILD A BUSINESS IN THE WILDERNESS IS VERY COSTLY. WE HAVE TO FLY EVERYTHING IN HERE, FROM SCREWS TO LIGHT BULBS TO PAINT, SUPPLIES. FOR FOOD, IT'S MAINLY BUFFALO AND CARIBOU AND MOOSE. SO, WE ALWAYS MOOSE HUNT IN THE FALLTIME, SO WE SAVE UP THE MEAT FOR THE WINTER. ONE OF THE FIRST PROJECTS, SO WE SHOULD HAVE IT DONE BEFORE JUNE 1st. OKAY, CHEF RON? SOUNDS GOOD. SOUNDS GOOD, BOSS. HOLY **** SON OF A BITCH! I JUST SAW IT. TOOK OFF DOWN THERE. I DON'T SEE ANY TRACKS, SO I DON'T KNOW IF HE CAME THIS WAY OR NOT. GET THE GUN, RON. BLACK BEARS HAVE A KEENER SENSE OF SMELL THAN ANY OTHER LAND MAMMAL. AND HE TOOK ALL THE MEAT. LOOK. THE MEAT COOLER'S EMPTY. AND SINCE LEAVING MEAT OUT IN THE WINTER IS A COMMON WAY OF REFRIGERATION HERE, THE 600-POUND BLACK BEAR CAN SMELL AND TRACK FOOD FROM 18 MILES AWAY. HE MUST HAVE COME UP FROM THE LAKE. THERE'S NO TRACKS HERE. YEAH, HE CAME FROM THE OTHER WAY. YEAH, MUST HAVE. YEAH. HE CAME FROM GREAT SLAVE. YEAH, PROBABLY. THIS IS EARLY. IN THE FALLTIME, WE USUALLY HAVE SOME PROBLEMS WITH BEARS COMING INTO THE LODGE. IN THE DEAD OF WINTER, IF YOU SEE ONE, YOU KNOW THERE'S A PROBLEM. LET'S GET'S PIKE MIKE, AND WE'LL GO AFTER HIM, SEE IF WE CAN TRACK HIM DOWN. YES. 'CAUSE NOW HE WILL BE BACK. HE COULD BE SICK OR CRAZY, AND NOW THAT HE KNOWS WE HAVE FOOD, HE WILL COME BACK OVER AND OVER. BETTER TO HAVE MORE GUYS AND A COUPLE RIFLES, TOO, YEAH? YEAH. WE'LL GO AFTER HIM AND GET THE BASTARD. FIRST LIGHT? FIRST LIGHT, MAN. WE DON'T HUNT FOR SPORT OUT HERE. IT'S BETWEEN US AND HIM, AND WE HAVE TO PROTECT OURSELVES. WELL, HOPEFULLY, IT'S JUST THE ONE. HE'S HUNGRY, SO WE'RE FAIR GAME, TOO. 35 MILES EAST, FAMILY MAN RANDY SIBBESTON HEADS INTO THE FOREST ON A SMALL ISLAND NEAR HIS HOUSEBOAT TO HUNT FOR FOOD. TODAY, I'M GOING OUT AND SETTING SNARES AND TRYING TO CATCH RABBITS AND PROCURE FRESH FOOD FOR MYSELF AND FOR MY FAMILY. WITH LESS THAN A TWO-DAY SUPPLY OF FRESH MEAT LEFT, RANDY HAS TO FIND A WAY TO KEEP HIS WIFE AND SIX CHILDREN FED. HE'S BROUGHT ALONG NATIVE-MADE SHOES TO HELP HIM NAVIGATE IN THE DEEP SNOWDRIFTS. THIS IS A TRADITIONAL PAIR OF BIRCH SNOWSHOES. IT'S MADE WITH BABICHE AND BIRCH. BABICHE IS THE SKIN OF THE ANIMAL THAT'S BEEN TREATED AND HAS BEEN CUT INTO THIN STRIPS SO IT MAKES A STRING. BUT THESE WILL REALLY, REALLY, REALLY SAVE YOUR BACON IN THE BUSH. TODAY, RANDY SETS SNARES FOR A TYPE OF RABBIT FOUND ONLY IN THE NORTH. THE SNOWSHOE HARE IS A CREATURE OF HABIT, AND WHEN HE MAKES A TRAIL, HE LIKES TO USE THE SAME TRAIL OVER AND OVER AGAIN. SO, WHEN I SEE AN ESTABLISHED RABBIT TRAIL, I ALWAYS FIND THAT'S THE BEST PLACE TO PUT YOUR SNARE. THE WAY TO MAKE A SNARE FOR RABBITS IS USING BRASS WIRE. I'LL USUALLY JUST MAKE, LIKE, A LITTLE NOOSE OUT OF IT AND THEN SHAPE IT CAREFULLY SO THAT IT'S ABOUT THE RIGHT SIZE FOR THE RABBIT TO GO INTO IT AND GET CAUGHT. THE RABBIT WILL COME RUNNING ALONG WITH HIS HEAD, AND IF YOU SET IT RIGHT, HE'LL CATCH IT LIKE THIS AND HE WILL BE CAUGHT. THE BRASS SNARE IS A QUICK AND EFFECTIVE AND HUMANE WAY OF CATCHING RABBITS, AND THAT'S WHY I USE THAT TECHNIQUE. AND JUST TAKE A FEW BRANCHES AND JUST MAKE A LITTLE RABBIT CORRAL SO THAT AS HE'S MAKING HIS QUICK DECISION ON THE RUN, HE COULD GO THIS WAY, HE COULD GO THIS WAY, BUT THERE'S BRANCHES HERE. IT'S JUST A LITTLE VISUAL, MENTAL TRICK THAT YOU PLAY ON THE RABBIT. TO CATCH ENOUGH RABBITS TO REPLENISH HIS NEARLY EMPTY STOCK, RANDY MUST SET DOZENS OF SNARES. THAT'S ONE DOWN... AND 50 MORE TO GO. IT'S A NUMBERS GAME, AND YOU HAVE TO BE OUT THERE PUTTING IN THE EFFORT IF YOU WANT TO GET THE RESULTS. OUT ON THE OPEN LAKE, FISHERMAN BRIAN ABBOTT IS ALSO LOOKING TO STOCKPILE FOOD. RECENT SNOWSTORMS HAD REDUCED HIS ABILITY TO SET NETS, BUT NOW HE HAS A BOMBARDIER, AN ALL-TERRAIN VEHICLE THAT WILL PROTECT HIM AND HIS FISH SUPPLY FROM THE ELEMENTS. HAVING A BOMBARDIER OUT ON THE ICE IS ACTUALLY KIND OF NICE. YOU'VE GOT SOMEWHERE WARM TO CLIMB INTO. IT ALSO HAULS MANY, MANY TIMES THE AMOUNT OF FISH THAT I COULD GET ON THE SKI-DOO. WE'RE OUT HERE TODAY PULLING THESE NETS, HOPING WE CAN FILL OUR FREEZERS. WE'VE GOT CUSTOMERS WAITING FOR FISH. IT'S BEEN A PRETTY TOUGH YEAR THIS YEAR SO FAR WITH THE COLD WE HAD. BRIAN HAS BROUGHT HIS ASSISTANT, SHEILA, TO HELP PULL IN NETS CAST 24 HOURS AGO, HOPING THESE HOLES WILL YIELD A LOAD OF FRESH FISH TO HAUL HOME. WE'VE GOT THREE NETS WE'RE GONNA PULL, AND HOPEFULLY, THEY'RE RIGHT CHOCK-FULL OF FISH. IT'S HARD WORK, ESPECIALLY DOWN LOW IN THE HOLE. WE'VE GOT NETS HERE TIED TOGETHER HERE. WE'RE GONNA DIG OURSELVES THROUGH THE ICE, GET AHOLD OF THE ROPE THAT'S HANGING ON TO OUR ANCHOR, AND PULL THE THING UP. YEAH, WE'RE OPENING UP THE BASE OF THE HOLE HERE 'CAUSE THE ICE HAS BEEN FORMING DOWN BELOW. SOME OF THIS ICE IS LIKE CONCRETE. THERE WE GO. IT'S STARTING TO CRACK. WELL, WE OPENED UP THE HOLE. NOW YOU KNOW YOU'RE ABOUT TO START COLLECTING SOME MONEY. THE FISH ARE GONNA BE COMING OUT, AND WITH ANY LUCK, THE NETS WILL BE FULL. BRIAN IS A GILL FISHERMAN. HE SETS HIS NETS 100 FEET DEEP IN A LAKE THAT MEASURES 2,000 FEET DEEP AND THEN HOPES THE FISH SWIM IN... A TRICKY, DIFFICULT BUSINESS. WE SHOULD START PULLING FISH OUT. **** WHAT? IT JUST CRACKED. NO! ARE YOU SERIOUS? THE LONGER THEY'RE SITTING, THERE'S GONNA BE MORE FISH THAT HAVE DIED IN THERE, AND YOU DON'T MAKE MONEY PICKING DEAD FISH. NIGHTMARE. SHOOT. BACK IN YELLOWKNIFE BAY, STEPHAN HERVIEUX AND ALLYCE RATTRAY ALSO NEED TO FIND FISH AND ARE PREPARING AN EXPEDITION OUT IN THE OPEN LAKE IN ORDER TO FILL THEIR FREEZERS. I GOT A SOLID PLAN TO CATCH FISH. I GOT A FISH CAMP. THE FISH ARE THERE. THEY'RE DEEP. STEPHAN OCCASIONALLY WORKS PART-TIME FOR COMMERCIAL FISHERMEN BRIAN AND HENRY, BUT NOW, DURING THIS BREAK IN THE WEATHER, HE NEEDS TO SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITY TO STOCKPILE. I CAN GO TO THE FISH CAMP. IT'S MY SETUP. IT'S MY BASE. FROM THERE, IT'S A SHORT DISTANCE TO GO FISHING, COME BACK TO THE CAMP. I DON'T HAVE TO DRIVE HOME EVERY DAY. IT'S ALL ABOUT THE BOTTOM LINE RIGHT NOW. WE NEED TO GET OUT THERE. THE WEATHER COULD CHANGE ANY MINUTE. IT HAS TO GET DONE. THIS VENTURE WILL TAKE HIM 50 MILES AWAY FROM HOME, ONTO THE OPEN EXPANSE OF GREAT SLAVE LAKE. BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A COLD WINTER, EVEN THE FISH ARE GOING DEEPER. THAT MEANS WE GOT TO GO FURTHER TO BE ABLE TO CATCH THOSE FISH. AND THAT'S JUST ADDING MORE RISK, MORE POTENTIAL FOR THINGS TO GO WRONG. THIS TIME, WITH ONLY SHORELINES AS LANDMARKS AND FRESH SNOW OBSCURING THE TRAIL, STEPHAN PROCEEDS WITH CAUTION AS HE SEARCHES FOR THE PRIME FISH-CAMP LOCATION HE SCOUTED DAYS AGO. GO RIGHT, RIGHT? NO, LEFT. I DON'T THINK SO, SWEETHEART. WELL, I THOUGH YOU KNEW WHICH WAY. I'D GO UP THE RIVER, BUT IT'S NOT SAFE NOW AND I'M NOT TAKING YOU AND DORA DOWN THE RIVER. GREAT SLAVE LAKE IN THE WINTER BECOMES A MASSIVE ICE LAKE. WE CAN WALK ON IT. WE CAN SNOWMOBILE ON IT. THE ONLY PROBLEM IS, THERE ARE NO STREET SIGNS, NO DIRECTIONS, AND WHEN YOU'RE OUT THERE ALONE, EVERYTHING LOOKS THE SAME. LOOK AT THIS TRAIL RIGHT HERE. IT LOOKS WAY MORE PACKED THAN THAT ONE. IT'S ALWAYS RISKY HEADING OUT ON A SNOW MACHINE, ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE GOING A WAYS AWAY, WHICH WE WERE. IN THE WINTER, IT'S SO EASY TO GET LOST ON THE LAKE, AND IT DOESN'T HELP THAT THIS IS A 1980s SNOW MACHINE THAT WE JUST GOT RUNNING AND DON'T KNOW THAT WELL. YOU DON'T DRIVE ALL THE BRIDGE. YOU WOULD HAVE TURNED LONG BEFORE THIS. I'M GETTING A LITTLE BIT SCARED 'CAUSE THIS IS NOT AN AREA THAT PEOPLE GO TO ON A DAILY BASIS. WE WERE ON OUR OWN. I DON'T KNOW, MAN. THE LAKE PROVIDES VERY LITTLE SHELTER AGAINST WHITEOUTS AND DEADLY NIGHT LOWS. REACHING THEIR CAMP LOCATION BEFORE SUNDOWN IS KEY TO THEIR SURVIVAL. WE JUST GOT TO MAKE A DECISION AND FOLLOW IT. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT... YOU'VE NEVER LED ME ASTRAY. I'M LISTENING TO YOU. LEFT IT IS? LEFT IT IS. ALL RIGHT. COME ON, DORA! I'M STILL A LITTLE NERVOUS. AS HOPEFUL AS I WANT TO BE, I MIGHT HAVE PICKED WRONG. THE LAST THING YOU WANT IS TO BE STUCK OUT ON THE LAKE... NO COMMUNICATION, NO SAFETY NET. THIS IS SURVIVAL NOW. IT'S MIDWINTER IN THE SUBARCTIC, AND FOR THE REBELS WHO DID NOT PREPARE ADEQUATE STOCKPILES IN THE FALL, PROVISIONS ARE LOW. AND NOW IS THE TIME TO RESTOCK. IT'S BENT STRAIGHT OUT. WHAT? IT JUST CRACKED. NO! ARE YOU SERIOUS? NIGHTMARE. SHOOT. BUT BRIAN AND SHEILA HAVE RUN INTO A BIG PROBLEM... THEIR METAL HOOK, NECESSARY FOR PULLING UP NETS, HAS FRACTURED. SHEILA WAS HAVING A LITTLE TROUBLE PULLING THIS NET UP, AND I TRIED TO STRAIGHTEN OUT THE HOOK THAT WE'VE GOT BUILT ON THE END. AND IT LOOKS LIKE WE BENT IT A FEW THOUSAND TIMES TOO MANY, AND IT SNAPPED OFF. WE'VE GOT TO GET THAT ROPE UP FROM UNDER THE ICE THERE IN ORDER TO GET THE NET OUT. NECESSARY EQUIPMENT... YOU MUST HAVE A TORCH. IF YOUR KNOTS FREEZE, YOU CAN'T GET THEM UNDONE, THROW THEM IN YOUR MOUTH AND CHEW ON IT UNTIL IT'S WARM OR HAVE A TORCH. I'M GONNA MELT OFF THE ICE WITH A TORCH SO I CAN GET AT THE WIRE AND UNWIND IT, AND I'LL WIND IT UP GOOD AND TIGHT AND HOPEFULLY, THIS THING IS GONNA WORK. SAVE ME SOME TIME IF I DON'T HAVE TO GO BACK TO CAMP. NOW IT CAN'T FALL OFF. IT CAN JUST TURN AROUND A BIT. I THINK IT'LL WORK. IT'S RIGHT ON THIS SIDE, ON THE CORNER THERE, RIGHT AT THE EDGE OF THE ICE. I GOT IT. HE'S COMING. IT WORKED! YEP, IT WORKED! WE'LL MAKE IT THROUGH THE DAY. OKAY, HERE. IT'S PROBABLY STUCK AT THE OTHER HOLE. I WONDER IF IT'S FREEZING IN THESE. YEAH. IT'S COMING, THOUGH. GEEZ, NOT MUCH FISH TODAY. NO. THAT'S NOT GOOD. THAT'S FAR ENOUGH. HOLY COW. THIS IS TERRIBLE. THIS IS KIND OF DEPRESSING, SEEING HOW MANY FISH I'M GETTING IN THIS FIRST NET HERE. USUALLY, A SINGLE GILL NET WILL HAUL IN 80 TO 100 FISH, BUT THERE ARE ONLY SEVEN IN THIS CATCH. NO, IT'S NOT LOOKING GOOD SO FAR, BUT SOMETIMES, ONE END'S A LITTLE BIT DEAD AND THE OTHER END WILL BE GOOD. I GUESS WE'LL SEE. SO, WE'RE ABOUT HALFWAY THROUGH THIS FIRST NET. IT'S NOT LOOKING VERY GOOD SO FAR. I'M HOPING THE NEXT END OF IT WILL BE A LITTLE BETTER. BUT IT'S GOING OUT TO THE DEEP END, SO IT'S PROBABLY NOT GONNA BE ANY BETTER, MAYBE NOT EVEN AS GOOD AS THE FIRST END. THAT'S NOT GOOD. GO AHEAD AND CHECK. BUT THE FIRST ONE'S NOT GONNA PAY A LOT OF BILLS. I'VE GOT WAGES TO PAY NOW, TOO. SO, SHE'LL GET MOST OF THAT FISH, I'LL GET A LITTLE, THE PLANT WILL GET A LITTLE. IT'S BETTER THAN NOTHING, THOUGH. GREAT SLAVE LAKE, SHE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A TRICKY LAKE. I'VE BEEN HERE 15 YEARS. THAT'S QUITE SOME TIME. BUT I REALLY KNOW WHERE THE FISH ARE. I'M STILL LEARNING DAILY, AND EVERY DAY, I THINK I'VE GOT IT DOWN PAT AND I FIND OUT THAT I DON'T. WITH THEIR FIRST NET OF FISH ALREADY FREEZING IN THE BITTER COLD, BRIAN AND SHEILA ARE FORCED TO HEAD BACK WITH A DISAPPOINTING CATCH. TO MEET THESE CUSTOMERS' DEMANDS, WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO CATCH LIKE 10 TIMES AS MUCH FISH. IN THE NORTH ARM OF THE LAKE, AT RAGNAR'S LODGE, HIS TEAM IS LEAVING TO HUNT DOWN A ROGUE BEAR THAT'S PILLAGED THEIR FOOD SUPPLY, THREATENING THEIR WINTER RESERVES. A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO, I WAS BRINGING BACK SIX MALLARDS, BUT I HAD TO GO TO THE WASHROOM, TO THE OUTHOUSE. SO, I'M PUTTING DOWN THE DUCKS ON THE PORCH OF THE OUTHOUSE, AND I GO IN AND DO MY THING. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, THIS BLACK BEAR'S COMING RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME WHEN I'M SITTING THERE. THE BEAR WAS HUGE. AND HE GRABBED THE DUCKS, AND HE RAN OFF. I ALMOST **** MY PANTS, BUT I COULDN'T BECAUSE I ALREADY WAS EMPTY. IT'S A LITTLE BIT LIKE THE WILD WEST. YOU KNOW, YOU DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IN ORDER TO SURVIVE. THE DEAD OF WINTER, USUALLY DON'T SEE BEARS THIS EARLY. IF ONE DOES COME OUT, YOU KNOW SOMETHING IS WRONG. WE'VE GOT TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. LET'S GO GET THE **** BEAR, OKAY? OKAY, THERE'S THE TRACK. LOOKS LIKE HE'S OUT THERE. 50 MILES TO THE SOUTHEAST, STEPHAN AND ALLYCE LOST THEIR WAY WHILE SEARCHING FOR THE TRAIL LEADING TO THEIR FISH CAMP. NOW THE COUPLE HOPES ALLYCE'S HUNCH PAYS OFF. YES! SUCCESS! SO, I SCOPED OUT THIS GREAT LOCATION WHERE IT'S MUCH DEEPER, AND THAT'S WHERE THE FISH ARE NOW. HOW ARE YOUR FEET? ARE THEY COLD FROM NOT MOVING TOO MUCH ON THE BACK OF THAT SLED? YEAH, I'LL BE HAPPY TO GET MOVING. STEPHAN AND ALLYCE PLAN TO SPEND THE NEXT 36 HOURS CAMPING AND FISHING HERE... ALL RIGHT. WHAT DO WE GOT? I HOPE WE DIDN'T LOSE ANYTHING ON THE TRIP. ...BUT IN ORDER TO SURVIVE HIGH WINDS AND NIGHTTIME TEMPERATURES OF -50, FIRST THEY NEED TO SET UP A STURDY SHELTER. OKAY, WE'VE GOT THE TENT. WE'VE GOT THE SHOVELS. WE'VE GOT THE CHIMNEY. WE'VE GOT THE STOVE. WE'VE GOT THE AUGER. THE SUN'S COMING LOWER ON THE HORIZON NOW, SO WE'RE GONNA BE RUNNING OUT OF DAYLIGHT IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS. WE'RE WAY OUT THERE ON THE LAKE. THAT'S WHY YOU'VE GOT TO BE REAL SMART. KEEP YOUR WITS. BE AWARE. PLAN AND PREPARE. BUT ANYTHING COULD HAPPEN. THESE LIGHTERS REALLY DON'T WORK WELL IN THE COLD. IT'S -20. THAT'S WHY YOU KEEP THEM IN THE INNER POCKET. YOU STILL GOT TO WARM THEM UP BEFORE THE FLAME REALLY LASTS LONG ENOUGH TO CATCH. IN THE DEAD OF WINTER, PREDATORS ARE ALWAYS A THREAT. THE FIRE WILL PROTECT NOT ONLY AGAINST THE ARCTIC COLD, BUT ALSO AGAINST THE WOLVES HUNGRY FOR FOOD. WE REALLY NEED TO START GETTING THIS TENT UP AND GET EVERYTHING GOING. THE MOST DANGEROUS THING ABOUT WOLVES IS THEY ALWAYS TRAVEL IN PACKS. SO, YOU MIGHT SEE ONE ON THE DISTANCE, BUT YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO WATCH YOUR BACK 'CAUSE THEY LIKE TO CIRCLE THEIR PREY. YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO BE WATCHING OUT. YOU KNOW WHAT MY FAVORITE PART OF THE DAY IS? WATCHING ME WORK? YOU KNOW ME SO WELL. SO, WE'VE GOT THE FIRE. WE'VE GOT THE PLATFORM. NOW IT'S TIME TO BUILD THE TENT. I THINK WE SHOULD START AT LEAST FIGURING OUT HOW WE'RE PUTTING THIS TOGETHER. I'VE GOT IT ALL DESIGNED. THESE ARE ALL MADE TO SPECS. I KNOW EXACTLY HOW IT'S GONNA GO. I DID A LITTLE BIT OF RESEARCH. I TOOK PICTURES OF SOMEBODY ELSE'S TENT. I FIGURED I HAD IT. I EVEN MADE MY CUTS. I LABELLED STUFF. I FIGURED, THIS IS GONNA GO UP IN AN HOUR. JUST TRYING TO REMEMBER WHY I PUT THAT HOLE IN THAT PANEL. AS TEMPERATURES DROP AND THE WIND PICKS UP WITH THE SETTING SUN, IT BECOMES A RACE AGAINST TIME TO COMPLETE THEIR TENT... ...AND GET THEIR STOVE FIRED UP BEFORE THE LAKE'S NIGHTTIME CONDITIONS TURN DEADLY. HOLD YOUR END. IF YOU CAN'T MAKE SHELTER, YOU'RE **** I NEED TO GET THAT TENT UP RIGHT NOW. IF NOT, WE'RE IN SOME SERIOUS TROUBLE. AT THIS POINT, SUCCESS IS WARMTH... THREE! ...BECAUSE AS SOON AS THAT SUN GOES DOWN, THAT COLD IS PIERCING. THIS ONE? YEAH. AND YOU SEE THAT FLANGE ON THE BOTTOM? YEAH. THAT'S THE FIRST PART THAT'S GOING IN. YEAH, THE DAMPER IS OFF TO THE SIDE USUALLY. YOU CAN'T TAKE ANYTHING FOR GRANTED. YOU HAVE TO TAKE YOUR TIME WHEN YOU'RE BUILDING A PLACE LIKE THIS, ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A WOOD STOVE INSIDE IT. I MEAN, YOU MAKE ONE SMALL MISTAKE, YOU JUST DECIDE IT'S GOOD ENOUGH, AND YOU COULD BURN DOWN YOUR TENT. IN FACT, LOW-QUALITY VERSIONS OF THESE STOVE HEATERS ARE CALLED HIPPIE KILLERS, EITHER CREATING TOO MUCH CARBON MONOXIDE, OR BURNING TENTS WITH PEOPLE TRAPPED INSIDE. YOU GOT THAT? YEAH. I'M GONNA GO OUTSIDE. HOW'S THAT? WE FINALLY PUT THE STOVE AND THE CHIMNEY UP. NICE. SO, HOPEFULLY, IT TAKES NO TIME TO HEAT THAT PLACE UP. IT'S GONNA KEEP US WARM. ABSOLUTELY. WHEN YOU SPEND A NIGHT IN JUST A SMALL CANVAS TENT IN THE MIDDLE OF WINTER, ESPECIALLY 'CAUSE WE'RE SLEEPING LOW TO THE GROUND, YOU FEEL IT. WE'RE GONNA HUNKER DOWN, KEEP WARM, AND HOPE FOR THE BEST. MILES FROM ANY OTHER LIVING SOUL, STEPHAN AND ALLYCE PREPARE TO FACE -50 ALONE. ANOTHER WINTER DAY RISES IN THE NORTHWEST TERRITORIES. GOOD MORNING, DORA. GOOD MORNING, LITTLE PUPPY DOG. STEPHAN AND ALLYCE HAVE SURVIVED THE SUBARCTIC NIGHT IN THEIR TENT. IT'S TOO WARM IN HERE. IT'S SO FREAKIN' COLD OUTSIDE THE BLANKETS. IT'S TIME TO GET UP. MAN, WE GOT A LOT OF WORK AHEAD OF US TODAY. IT AIN'T GONNA HAPPEN WITH ME SITTING IN THIS COMFORTABLE SLEEPING BAG. LET'S DO IT. IT'S GO TIME, PEOPLE! YEAH. HOW IS IT OUT THERE? COLD. COLD. HERE IN THE NORTHWEST TERRITORIES, DAYLIGHT IS ALWAYS AN ISSUE. WE NEED TO GET THOSE HOLES DONE, GET THOSE LINES IN, PULL SOME FISH OUT. THAT'S WHAT WE CAME HERE TO DO. PULL LIKE YOU MEAN IT. GO. COME ON, HONEY. COME ON. FIRST THING IN THE MORNING. READY TO ROCK 'N' ROLL. SLED STARTS. WE'RE OFF TO A GREAT DAY OF FISHING. THEY'VE GOT TO BE THE EARLY BIRDS IF THEY HOPE TO CATCH ANY FISH. 16 MILES NORTHWEST... HOPEFULLY, I HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF LUCK. ...RANDY TREKS THROUGH TWO FEET OF NEWLY FALLEN SNOW TO CHECK ON THE RABBIT TRAPS HE SET YESTERDAY. NATURE HAS ALWAYS PROVIDED FOR THE PEOPLE OF THE NORTH. BEING ON THE LAKE IS A REAL TREASURE TROVE OF RESOURCES. HEY. WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT. THAT'S A NICE SIGHT TO SEE. THAT'S JUST GREAT. AS YOU CAN SEE, THE SNOWSHOE HARE IS NOT PARTICULARLY BIG, BUT IT'S SUBSTANTIAL, AND IT'S VERY DELICIOUS. EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT EATING. OUT HERE, MOTHER NATURE PROVIDES YOU WITH THE RESOURCES TO DO ANYTHING YOU NEED. YOU USE IT TO GET YOUR FOOD SUPPLY FOR THE YEAR, TOO HELP YOUR LOVED ONES. AS RANDY HIKES ON TO CHECK THE DOZENS OF OTHER SNARES HE SET IN THE WOODS... STEPHAN AND ALLYCE DRIVE OUT TO THE MIDDLE OF THE LAKE TO START REPLENISHING THEIR SUPPLY OF FISH. I HAVE THE FISH CAMP. IT'S MY SETUP. IT'S MY BASE. FROM THERE, IT'S A SHORT DISTANCE TO GO FISHING. COME BACK THE CAMP... SAVING MONEY ON GAS, SAVING MONEY ON OIL. IT'S ALL ABOUT THE BOTTOM LINE RIGHT NOW. KEEP DIGGING, DORA. KEEP DIGGING. THERE YOU GO. SO, STEPH PICKED A COUPLE SPOTS FOR US FOR TODAY. AND THEN IT'S JUST A MATTER OF DRILLING THROUGH THE HOLES, SETTING UP YOUR LINES, AND GETTING THEM IN THERE. AM I DRILLING THIS ONE, OR ARE YOU DRILLING THIS ONE? WANT TO GO TEAM? I DRILL, YOU CLEAR. 10-4. "THOSE ARE TERRIBLE." MAYBE THE GUY... PERSONALLY, I LOVE DRILLING THROUGH THE ICE WITH THE HAND AUGER. IT'S EXERCISE. GO, ALLYCE. BORING MULTIPLE HOLES THROUGH FIVE FEET OF ICE WITH ONLY A HAND AUGER BURNS VALUABLE FISHING TIME AND PRECIOUS CALORIES. I THINK WE'RE PRETTY CLOSE. I KNOW. I FELT THAT, TOO. GO, TEAM. YOU GOT THIS NICE AND LIGHT. THERE WE GO! IT'S REALLY NICE TO SEE THE LIQUID WATER, BECAUSE IN THE DEEP, DARK OF WINTER, IT FEELS LIKE NOTHING'S ALIVE, THAT EVERYTHING IS FROZEN. AND JUST SEEING THAT BIT OF LIQUID GIVES YOU HOPE AGAIN. OKAY, IT'S FISHY TIME. WHEN THE LINE GOES SLACK, YOU KNOW YOU HIT THE BOTTOM, SO THEN YOU BRING IT UP A FEW INCHES, 'CAUSE THE FISH AREN'T SWIMMING RIGHT ON THE BOTTOM. A GAS-POWERED AUGER AS SOON AS I CAN AFFORD ONE. 25 MILES WEST OF YELLOWKNIFE, ON THE NORTH ARM OF THIS COLOSSAL LAKE, A HUNGRY BLACK BEAR IS ON THE PROWL AND THREATENS TO CONTINUE RAVAGING RAGNAR'S WINTER FOOD SUPPLY. WHERE ARE YOU LOOKING? JUST SAW IT IN THE CUT THERE. WE'RE DOWNWIND, SO MAYBE HE'S GOT A SENSE OF US BY SIGHT, CAN'T SMELL US. YEAH, MAYBE. MAYBE. RAGNAR HAS RECRUITED CHEF RON AND PIKE MIKE TO HELP TRACK DOWN THE ROGUE BEAR. IT'S CRUCIAL THAT THEY DEAL WITH THIS PROBLEM NOW OR RISK THE BEAR RETURNING TO STEAL FOOD ALL WINTER LONG. I'M GONNA LOOK AROUND THE SIDES FOR THESE TRACKS, SEE WHICH DIRECTION THEY CAME FROM. DON'T WANT TO SHOOT HIM IF WE DON'T HAVE TO, BUT... NO, WE SURE DON'T. IF HE GETS INTO CAMP, HE'LL DESTROY EVERYTHING. PREPARATION IS EVERYTHING IN TERMS OF DETERRENTS. MAKE SURE YOU CAN SCARE THE BEAR AWAY BEFORE IT GETS REWARDED. I WANT TO SHOW YOU OVER HERE THE TRACKS, FIGURE OUT WHICH WAY IT'S... WHERE IT'S COME FROM. HE'S GONE THAT WAY. GONE UP AROUND THE CORNER OF THE CUT THERE. AT AN AVERAGE WEIGHT OF 600 POUNDS AND A TOP RUNNING SPEED OF 35 MILES PER HOUR, THE GREAT SLAVE LAKE BLACK BEAR IS A THREAT THAT CANNOT BE UNDERESTIMATED. YOU KNOW, HE'S GETTING ON THE TRAIL. ALL THESE OTHER ANIMALS ARE HUNGRY, AND HE'S HUNGRY, TOO. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO SOMETHING. HE ALREADY TOOK SOME CARIBOU MEAT FROM US. YOU GOT YOUR SNOWSHOES ON YET, RAGNAR? YOU GOT YOUR SNOWSHOES ON YET? WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF DAYLIGHT, HERE. YEAH. BURNING DAYLIGHT, GUYS. OKAY, MIKE, HURRY UP. YOU'RE LEAD HUNTER. I'M COMING AFTER YOU. AND WE'RE GONNA GET INTO SOME THICK BRUSHES. AND THE ONLY WAY TO PENETRATE THAT IS BY SNOWSHOES. YOU SAID HE WAS COMING IN THIS WAY, MIKE? YEAH, WELL, HE'S COME RIGHT UP HERE. HE'S THROUGH THE LITTLE GULLY THERE. SO HE'S GONE ALONG THE EDGE OF THE WILLOWS OVER THERE, JUST IN FRONT OF THOSE SPRUCE. EVERY STEP YOU TAKE OUT THERE HAS TO BE A STEP OF EXTREME CAUTION. ALWAYS CONSIDER THAT THERE MIGHT BE A BEAR AROUND. THE BEAR RECOGNIZES MAN AS A DANGEROUS ANIMAL, AND MAN, AT THE SAME TIME, CAN SENSE THE DANGER IN A BEAR, SO THERE'S A RESPECT THAT'S DEVELOPED BETWEEN THE TWO. AS SOON AS YOU STEP OVER THAT BOUNDARY OF RESPECT, THEN WE'RE GETTING INTO CONFRONTATION. YEAH, AND HE COULD BE ANYWHERE RIGHT NOW, RON. ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO HAVE A LITTLE CLOSER LOOK AT THE TRACK HERE. OKAY, THERE'S THE TRACKS. THERE HE IS RIGHT THERE. STOP. YOU MISSED. HE'S ASS END OVER THE HILL. HURRY UP! LET'S GET HIM! A WOUNDED BEAR IS VERY DANGEROUS. YOU'VE GOT TO BE VERY CAREFUL TRACKING THEM, BECAUSE THE CAN ACTUALLY AMBUSH YOU. THEY CAN LAY BEHIND A ROCK AND WAIT FOR YOU, AND THEN YOU'RE GONE. HE'S ASS END OVER THE HILL. HURRY UP! LET'S GET HIM! HE'S GONE! HE'S GONE! GO! GO! ON THE FAR NORTHERN ARM OF GREAT SLAVE LAKE, RAGNAR AND HIS TEAM HAVE TRACKED DOWN THE BLACK BEAR THAT'S BEEN THREATENING HIS LODGE'S LIMITED FOOD SUPPLY. YOU MISSED. HE'S ASS END OVER THE HILL. HURRY UP! LET'S GET HIM! RETURNING TO THEIR SNOWMOBILE, THE TEAM RACES TO THE HILLTOP. IF THE SHOT ONLY WOUNDED THE BEAR, THE ANIMAL COULD BE EVEN MORE DEADLY. WELL, THIS IS WHERE IT WAS WHEN I SHOT HIM, AND THERE'S NO BLOOD WHATSOEVER. AND HE WAS CONTINUING IN ORDER TO GO EAST. HE MAY BE LONG GONE INTO THICK BUSH, INTO DEEP SNOW. HE'S GONE NOW. HE CAN FIND OTHER FOOD SOURCES THERE. IN A WAY, IT'S A GOOD THING, BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE TO DESTROY THE BEAR. HE'S GONE OFF INTO THE HEAVY BUSH, AND WE'LL NEVER TRACK HIM. JUST GONNA LET HIM GO FOR THIS TIME, THEN. BUT IF HE COMES BACK, WE GOT TO BE MORE PREPARED. WE'RE OKAY NOW FOR A WHILE UNTIL THE NEXT BEAR, AND THEN WE HAVE TO START OVER THE WHOLE PROCESS. IT'S A NEVER-ENDING STORY, BUT IT'S PART OF LIVING IN THE WILD. ON A SMALL ISLAND NEAR YELLOWKNIFE BAY, RANDY CONTINUES TO CLEAR RABBIT SNARES TO RESTOCK PROVISIONS THAT WILL FEED HIS FAMILY FOR THE REMAINING TWO MONTHS OF WINTER. **** I THINK I CUT MYSELF. **** I WAS OUT IN THE COLD, FUMBLING WITH MY PLIERS, AND WOUND UP CUTTING MY KNUCKLE, SO I USED A LITTLE BIT OF BIRCH BARK IN ORDER TO MAKE A BAND-AID. IT'S REALLY GOOD LITTLE FIRST-AID TRICK, YOU KNOW? A LITTLE BIT OF THIS. IT'S FAIRLY PLIABLE, JUST LIKE A GOOD PIECE OF PAPER. SPRUCE SAP HAS VERY ANTISEPTIC PROPERTIES, SO IT'S A VERY EFFECTIVE REMEDY FOR CUTS AND SCRAPES AND INFECTIONS. TAKE THIS LITTLE DROPLET HERE, AND YOU WANT THE CLEAR, FRESH STUFF THAT'S NOT REALLY HARD YET. PUT IT ON THERE. EVEN LOOKS LIKE A BAND-AID, DOESN'T IT? I MEAN, CAN'T GET MUCH BETTER THAN THAT. OUT HERE, MOTHER NATURE PROVIDES YOU WITH THE RESOURCES TO DO ANYTHING YOU NEED. WHEN YOU'RE LIVING OFF THE GRID AND SOMETHING GOES WRONG, THE RESOURCES ON THE LAKE ARE THE ONLY THING YOU HAVE. ALL'S WELL. BACK TO 100% IN NO TIME. AS RANDY FINISHES HIS SEARCH FOR RABBIT MEAT, STEPHAN AND ALLYCE ARE STILL TRYING FOR MUCH-NEEDED FISH, DESPERATE FOR ANY SIGN OF A BITE THAT WILL MAKE THIS LONG HAUL TO THE MIDDLE OF THE LAKE WORTH THEIR TIME AND WANING RESOURCES. ONCE THEY START BITING, THEY TEND TO KEEP BITING. EVEN AFTER WAITING THIS LONG, WE COULD STILL HAVE SOME LUCK. ONCE WE GET ONE, THERE'S NORMALLY ANOTHER ONE NOT TOO FAR AWAY. THEY'RE DOWN THERE. THIS LAKE IS POLLUTED WITH FISH. WE'RE TALKING GREAT SLAVE, MAN. THEORETICALLY, I SHOULD HAVE ALREADY CAUGHT FISH. YOU JUST GOT TO KEEP HOPEFUL. CAN'T GIVE UP. EVERYONE HAS A MASTER. YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH YOUR ENVIRONMENT. I'M A SLAVE TO GREAT SLAVE LAKE. IF WE GAVE UP EASILY, WE WOULDN'T BE LIVING OUT HERE. IT'S THE DEAD OF WINTER ON GREAT SLAVE LAKE... I AIN'T GONNA PRETEND LIKE I'M SUPER HAPPY ABOUT IT. I GOT SKUNKED. SO NOW WE'RE GONNA HEAD HOME. I GOT TO RETHINK MY PLAN, MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS. ...AND STEPHAN AND ALLYCE HAVE FAILED TO SCORE FISH ON THEIR OWN. HEY, BRIAN. HEY, HOW YOU DOING, STEPH? ONCE BACK IN THE BAY, HIS NEW PLAN INCLUDES HIS NEIGHBOR, BRIAN. HOW YOU BEEN, BROTHER? GOOD. HAVEN'T SEEN YOU IN A LONG TIME. ALWAYS STUCK ON THAT ISLAND ALL THE TIME. 10-4. YOU GOT TO MAKE MONEY. IF WE DON'T GET OUR HOUSEBOAT STOCKED UP WITH ALL THE SUPPLIES WE NEED, WE'RE GONNA RUN OUT OF FOOD BEFORE BREAK-UP. NOTHING CAN BEAT BRUTE FORCE. WELL, YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT GOING ON YOUR OWN OR SOMETHING, I HAD HEARD. SO, YOU MEAN THAT'S... I JUST SPENT AN ENTIRE DAY ON THE LAKE, TRYING TO CATCH FISH. WE DIDN'T CATCH ANYTHING. I'M KIND OF HUNGRY. SO FOR ME, COMING DOWN HERE TO BRIAN'S, IT'S JUST A SMART THING TO DO. MAYBE WE SHOULD PUT YOU TO WORK OR SOMETHING. IT LOOKS LIKE STEPHAN NEEDS SOME WORK, AND HE'S OBVIOUSLY WILLING TO GET IN AND DO SOMETHING DIRTY. WELL, ALL WE NEED TO DO IS INCREASE THE VOLUME OF FISH. THAT'S COMING THIS WEEK. WE'RE GONNA HAVE HENRY SO BUSY, HE'S NOT GONNA KNOW WHICH WAY IS UP. HE'LL NEVER GET ANY SLEEP. WITH YOUR HELP, HE MIGHT GET SOME. OKAY. WE JUST GOT TO GET ENOUGH NETS IN THERE TO GET ENOUGH. OKAY. AND FIGURE OUT WHERE THEY'RE ALL HIDING. WELL, I THINK IT'D BE REALLY GOOD HAVING STEPHAN THERE. SO, WE CAN PROBABLY FISH THREE TIMES AS MANY NETS WITH TWO PEOPLE AS ONE CAN DO. WE'RE GONNA NEED AS MUCH FISH AS WE CAN POSSIBLY GET OR OUR CUSTOMERS ARE GONNA RUN OUT. THEY DEPEND ON US. I APPRECIATE THAT. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH. APPRECIATE IT, MAN. PLEASURE. SEE YOU. YOU TWO, BROTHER. SEE YOU. I GOT MYSELF MORE WORK, APPARENTLY. BRIAN'S HIRED ME TO GO TO THE NET LINES AND HAUL FISH OUT OF THE NETS AND BRING IT BACK TO THE BARGE. BACK ON THE NORTH ARM, RAGNAR AND HIS CREW PREPARE A MEAL, STILL ANXIOUS ABOUT THE RAVENOUS BLACK BEAR THAT REMAINS AT LARGE. SO, I PULLED THE TRIGGER, AND I SHOT ABOVE IT. IT WAS TOO FAR. WE WENT UP OVER THE RIDGE. WE FOLLOW HIS TRACKS. THERE WAS NO BLOOD. THERE WAS NOTHING. AND WE TRACKED HIM FOR ABOUT TWO MILES. HE'S GONE. THIS IS TIME OF YEAR, THIS IS THE SEASON, END OF THE WINTER, FOOD IS SCARCE ON THE LAND. NORMALLY, WE WOULDN'T BE WORRIED ABOUT BEARS, BUT WE MIGHT HAVE TO... CLEAN UP REALLY, REALLY WELL HERE. THE HUNGRY BEAR HAS TO EAT SOMETHING. IF THEY RECOGNIZE YOUR FOOD SOURCE, THEY DON'T RESPECT YOUR OWNERSHIP OF IT. IT'S JUST A FOOD SOURCE. WE CAN'T SPEND TOO MUCH TIME HERE. I'M A LITTLE SHAKY. THOSE BEAR TRACKS ARE KIND OF UNNERVING ME A LITTLE BIT RIGHT NOW. HOPEFULLY, HE DOESN'T COME BACK, BUT IF HE DOES COME BACK, WE'RE READY. PIKE MIKE GOT HIS GUN. I GOT MY GUN. IF HE COMES, WE'RE GONNA WELCOME HIM. WELL, LET'S HAVE SOME SASHIMI, HERE, MIKE. ALL RIGHT, RAGNAR. THANK GOD WE FINALLY GOT SOME FISH. I'M STARVING, MAN. BANNOCK WILL BE READY IN A MINUTE THERE, GUYS. GOOD, GOOD. SASHIMI AND BANNOCK. IT'S THE BEST. THAT'S BUSH LUNCH. MERCI. BACK ON THE OPEN LAKE, FISHERMEN BRIAN, SHEILA, AND NEW HIRE STEPHAN ARE JOINING FORCES AFTER THEIR INDIVIDUAL EFFORTS TO BRING HOME FISH FAILED THE DAY BEFORE. WITH THE FISH SCHOOLS CONSTANTLY MOVING UNDERNEATH THE FROZEN SURFACE, THE MORE NETS THEY CAN SET AND PULL TODAY, THE BETTER CHANCE THEY HAVE OF MAKING IT THROUGH THE FINAL TWO MONTHS OF WINTER. THAT IS STUCK. YEAH. WE'RE ABOUT TO PULL OUR FIRST NET RIGHT NOW, AND I'M HOPING THIS THING IS JUST CHOKED RIGHT FULL. WE'RE GONNA FIND OUT IN A MOMENT. IT'S LIKE CHRISTMAS. YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GONNA GET TILL YOU OPEN IT UP. PULL, SHEILA! SOFTLY! LITTLE JERKS, LITTLE TUGS! THERE SHE GOES. OKAY, THERE! I GOT IT! CAN YOU GET MORE? YEP, THERE SHE GOES. OKAY, I BETTER GO PULL NOW. YOU WANT TO TAKE IT FROM HERE, OR...? YEAH. IT WAS JAMMING OVER THERE. YEAH, I KNOW. I DON'T WANT YOU TO HAVE TO DO THE JOB I WAS HIRED TO DO. THANKS, SHEILA. IT'S NOT THAT HARD. IT WAS JAMMED OVER THERE. WAS IT? YEAH. HERE, TO BE A PROFESSIONAL FISHERMAN, YOU GOT TO BE AS STRONG AS AN OX. IT TAKES SUPERHUMAN STRENGTH TO PULL THESE NETS THAT ARE FULL OF FISH. I GOT A LOT OF RESPECT FOR BRIAN AND SHEILA, 'CAUSE I'M TELLING YOU, THESE TWO ARE AS TOUGH AS IT COMES. COME ON. **** ME. NOPE, WE'RE SNAGGED RIGHT THERE. BRIAN! IT'S STUCK AGAIN! SO THE SURFACE OF THE ICE UNDERNEATH THE WATER IS ACTUALLY QUITE ROUGH AND EDGY AT TIMES. AND IT JUST SO HAPPENS NOW THAT I'VE SNAGGED THE NET. IF YOU CAN'T GET THAT NET UN-SNAGGED, YOU CAN'T PUT THE NET BACK UNDERWATER, WHICH MEANS YOU CAN'T CATCH ANY MORE FISH. SNAGGED AGAIN! THIS LAKE IS RUTHLESS, AND IT WILL NOT GIVE UP ITS BOUNTY WITHOUT A FIGHT. MOVING NOW? UM, I THINK SO. NOPE, THAT'S IT RIGHT THERE. WE'RE STILL SNAGGED. TRY THAT. I AM PULLING AND PULLING AND PULLING, AND NOTHING IS HAPPENING. IF I CAN'T GET THE JOB DONE, BRIAN'S GONNA FIRE ME. GEEZ. IT'S MID-WINTER IN THE HARSH SUBARCTIC LAKE NEAR YELLOWKNIFE BAY. AND HOUSEBOATER STEPHAN HERVIEUX IS WORKING WITH COMMERCIAL FISHERMEN BRIAN ABBOT AND SHEILA FRISE, HOPING TO SHARE IN THE POTENTIAL BOUNTY THEIR NETS MAY BRING, ALLOWING HE AND HIS FIANCéE TO STOCK UP THROUGH SPRING. NOPE, WE'RE SNAGGED RIGHT THERE. BRIAN! IT'S STUCK AGAIN! SNAGGED AGAIN! BUT THE LAKE DOESN'T GIVE UP ITS TREASURE EASILY. TRY THAT. YEP! THIS LAKE IS THE MOST BOUNTIFUL LAKE IN THE WORLD, AND THE FISH INSIDE OF IT ARE INNUMERABLE. IF WE START PULLING ENOUGH FISH, I COULD BE WORKING FULL-TIME, LIVING ON THE LAKE, WORKING ON THE LAKE. THIS IS LIFE. THE AMOUNT OF FISH WE'RE GETTING IS IMMENSE. BRIAN'S INSTINCTS PAY OFF. THE FISHING HOLE YIELDS A BIG ENOUGH HAUL TO STOCK BRIAN'S FREEZERS FOR THE NEXT FEW WEEKS AND EARN A NICE PAYDAY FOR STEPHAN. WELL, IT'S KIND OF NICE GETTING LOTS OF FISH IN. WE'D REALLY LIKE TO ACTUALLY SHOW A GOOD PROFIT. YEAH, THEY'VE BEEN GETTING BETTER EVERY PULL. AS WE WERE LOADING UP ALL OUR FISH IN THE BOMBARDIER, I NOTICED THIS ONE LONE FISH SWIMMING AT THE TOP OF THE SURFACE OF ONE OF OUR HOLES, AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF, "THIS FISH IS MINE." HE'S TRYING TO GO DOWN. HOLD ON, HOLD ON. I'LL GET HIM. I'LL GET HIM. I'LL GET HIM. I'LL GET HIM. I'LL GET HIM. DON'T LET HIM GO. I'LL GET HIM, SHEILA. DON'T WORRY. I GOT THIS GUY. NO, NO, NO, NO. I GOT HIM. I GOT HIM. DON'T WORRY. DON'T WORRY. DON'T WORRY. DON'T WORRY. DON'T WORRY. DON'T WORRY. PATIENCE. PATIENCE. YEAH! YEAH! ONE-HANDED! YOU AIN'T GOING NOWHERE, BABY! YOU'RE ALL MINE. YOU'RE DINNER. * YOU'LL BE DINNER IN MY BELLY TONIGHT, LITTLE FISH * THIS IS WHY I LOVE LIVING ON THE LAKE. THE LAKE PROVIDES EVERYTHING. IT TAKES CARE OF ALL OF YOUR NEEDS. YOU JUST GOT TO BE REALLY READY TO SEIZE THAT OPPORTUNITY WHEN IT COMES. BACK IN YELLOWKNIFE BAY, RANDY HAS SUCCESSFULLY RETURNED HOME WITH SEVERAL RABBITS IN TOW, ENOUGH TO FEED HIS FAMILY FOR A FEW MORE DAYS. THIS IS A WAY OF LIFE THAT IS SUSTAINABLE. AND I AM GETTING HUNGRY. YEAH. HERE. WE TAKE WHAT WE NEED FROM THE FORESTS AND THE LAKES AND THE ENVIRONMENT FOR OUR SUSTENANCE AND OUR SURVIVAL. SO, WHAT ELSE ARE WE GONNA HAVE? JUST RABBIT AND...? I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE BOIL SOME POTATOES, HAVE SOME MASHED POTATOES. SOUNDS GOOD. REALLY GOOD. THE BOYS WILL BE HAPPY. YEAH, IT'S SOMETHING... IT'S NICE TO KNOW THAT I'VE BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE GOOD, HEALTHY FOOD FOR THE KIDS AND THE FAMILY. AND IT'S A VERY CLEAN, HONEST WAY OF LIVING, AND IT MAKES ME FEEL GOOD. AS THE SUN SETS ON THE LAKE, THE REBELS RETURN HOME TO THE FISH PLANT TRIUMPHANT. LAST ONE. WORK, WORK. CHALLENGE, CHALLENGE. FAIL, FAIL, FAIL. BUT WHEN YOU GET SUCCESS, WHEN IT DOES ACTUALLY COME TO FRUITION, I FEEL AWESOME. LET ME GIVE YOU A HAND WITH THAT, BRIAN. THAT'S HEAVY, MAN. WHOO-WEE! LOOK AT THIS SUCKER. WE SHOULD JUST GET SOME HOOKS AND DRAG 'EM. THE HOUSEBOATERS ON GREAT SLAVE LAKE ARE SOME OF THE PROUDEST, KINDEST, WARMEST-HEARTED PEOPLE I'VE EVER MET. I MEAN, YESTERDAY KICKED MY ASS. TODAY WAS A MOMENT OF GREATNESS. I'M JUST SO HAPPY AND SO GRATEFUL FOR THE PEOPLE IN MY LIFE. I'LL BE LEARNING ALL ABOUT IT. HANG ON. THAT'S HEAVY. WE SURE GOT A LOT OF CONEY TODAY, THOUGH. YEAH, TONES OF IT. YEAH, A LOT MORE CONEY. THEY START COMING IN THICK THIS TIME OF YEAR. THIS TIME OF THE YEAR, THE FISH ARE JUST BEGINNING TO PICK UP. THIS IS MORE LIKE WHAT IT SHOULD BE, AND IT WILL GET BETTER THAN THIS EVERY DAY FROM NOW ON. IT'LL GET THICKER RIGHT UP UNTIL JUST BEFORE WE STOP FISHING. WELL, THAT'S IT? RIGHT ON. THAT'S ALL OF HER. WELL, THANKS A LOT, STEPH. NO PROBLEM. APPRECIATE IT. THAT EXTRA HAND SPEEDED HER UP A BIT. TOMORROW WILL REALLY HELP A LOT, TOO. WE GET AN EXTRA COUPLE OF NETS. WE MIGHT ACTUALLY GET THE FREEZERS FULL. KIND OF LOOKING FORWARD TO TOMORROW, SEE HOW WE DO. I'LL SEE YOU BRIGHT AND EARLY TOMORROW MORNING. ALL RIGHT. APPRECIATE IT, MAN. NO PROBLEM. HAVE A GOOD NIGHT, GUYS. YOU HAVE A GOOD ONE.
