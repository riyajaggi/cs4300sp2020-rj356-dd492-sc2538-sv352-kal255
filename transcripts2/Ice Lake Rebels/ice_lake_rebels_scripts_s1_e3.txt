 LET'S GET A MAJOR SEARCH AND RESCUE GOING HERE. GONNA HAVE TO. IN TIMES LIKE THESE, YOU REALLY DEPEND ON YOUR NEIGHBORS. PEOPLE DIE DUE TO EXPOSURE ALL THE TIME IN THE NORTH. FOR THAT TO HAPPEN TO FRIENDS OF MINE WOULD BE UNTHINKABLE TO ME. THE REBELS BAND TOGETHER IN SEARCH OF THEIR OWN. BUT IF YOU GET WET IN -46, WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT HOURS. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MINUTES BEFORE YOU'RE GONE. A MONTH PAST FREEZE-UP WITH SIX LONG MONTHS OF WINTER AHEAD, THE LAKE IS FROZEN SOLID TO A DEPTH OF SIX FEET. THE SAFEST PLACE FOR THE 35 HOUSEBOATERS WHO MAKE THEIR HOME HERE IS IN YELLOWKNIFE BAY. THE HOUSEBOATS ARE SITUATED ALL AROUND THE ISLAND. THEY'RE KIND OF WRAPPED AROUND IT. WE'RE NICE AND SHELTERED. WE DON'T GET THE HUGE WINDS AND WAVES, WHICH IS GREAT. THEY MOOR THEIR HOMES NEAR A CLUSTER OF TINY ISLANDS THAT PROVIDE SHELTER AGAINST THE LAKE'S BRUTAL WINDS IN -40-DEGREE TEMPERATURE. THERE'S A LOT OF CHALLENGES AND VERY SPECIFIC CHALLENGES THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH LIVING ON A FLOATING HOME IN THE NORTH IN YELLOWKNIFE BAY. YOU GOT THE WEATHER, YOU'VE GOT SOMETIMES BRUTAL ICE CONDITIONS... DANGEROUS, TREACHEROUS ICE CONDITIONS. THE ICE CREATES A CONSTANT HAZARD. THE ICE IS A CONSTANT PROBLEM. THE THRILL OF LIVING ON A HOUSEBOAT IN THE SUBARCTIC IS A BALANCE BETWEEN NATURE AND THE GOOD TIMES AND THE DANGEROUS TIMES. HON! WHAT? COME HERE FOR A SEC! I THINK WE'RE FROZEN IN AGAIN. AFTER YOU COOK IN THE HOUSE OR HAVE A SHOWER, THE HUMIDITY GOES TO EVERY SINGLE CRACK. THE DOOR IS FROSTED SHUT. LET ME JUST KICK IT. MAYBE IT'LL BREAK THE BOND. SEE? YEAH. IT'S TOTALLY FROSTED. THERE ARE TIMES WHERE YOU ARE 100% TRAPPED AND HELPLESS ON YOUR HOUSEBOAT. WANT TO GO GRAB A KNIFE? YEP. YOU CAN'T TAKE ANYTHING FOR GRANTED. YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN. IF YOU WANT, YOU CAN BOIL SOME WATER, THEN WE'LL JUST POUR THE HOT, BOILING WATER IN THE CRACK, AND HOPEFULLY THAT'LL THAW THE OTHER SIDE. OKAY, I GOT SOME WATER. THAT'S HOT, THAT'S HOT, THAT'S HOT. DO YOU WANT ME TO HOLD IT UP THERE? NO. NO. I'M OKAY. I'M OKAY. YEAH, LOOK. THERE'S WATER ON THE OTHER SIDE. THAT'S AWESOME. THAT MEANS WE'RE GETTING THROUGH. YEAH, LOOK AT THIS, HON. OKAY, READY? OKAY, SQUEEZE HARD. ONE, TWO... ONE, TWO... ONE, TWO... YEAH! NICE! GOOD JOB! STEPHAN AND I HAVE TO RELY ON EACH OTHER TO MAKE IT THROUGH THESE CRAZY, COLD WINTERS. NICE, NICE, NICE, NICE, NICE, NICE. NOW I GOT TO GET MOVING. MY ARCTIC PRINCESS DESERVES THE BEST. ALLYCE AND I ARE GETTING MARRIED IN THE SPRING, SO IT'S TIME TO MAKE MONEY. 35 MILES AWAY, ONE LONE REBEL FACES THE SUBARCTIC TEMPERATURES ALONE. WILDERNESS LODGE OWNER RAGNAR WESSTROM IS USED TO BATTLING THE DAILY CHALLENGES OF LIFE OUTSIDE THE BAY. RAGNAR WESSTROM... THAT'S MY NAME. AND THIS IS MY **** LAND. THING WON'T START, RAGNAR! "PIKE" MIKE HARRISON, AN EXPERT GUIDE AND TRACKER AT THE LODGE, GETS READY FOR THEIR 35-MILE TREK TO YELLOWKNIFE FOR PROVISIONS. MY REAL NAME IS MICHAEL HARRISON, BUT AROUND HERE, LOCALLY, I'M PIKE MIKE. STARTING THESE THINGS AT -38 BELOW... IT'S COLD. RAGNAR IS A TASKMASTER, BUT OUT OF ALL THE PEOPLE, HE KNOWS THE AREA BETTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE. I'M ACTUALLY A REFUGEE FROM SWEDEN. MY GOVERNMENT WAS TRYING TO KILL ME IN 1986. THEY WERE TRYING TO TAX ME TO DEATH. I HAD TO LEAVE. I HAD NO OTHER OPTION. I'VE KNOWN PIKE MIKE FOR 12 YEARS. JUST PISS ON THE **** FUEL PUMP, MAN! WE'VE GOT TO GET GOING HERE! THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RAGNAR AND I IS VERY COMPLEX. I'LL DO JUST ABOUT ANYTHING YOU ASK ME HERE, BUT I'M NOT **** PISSING ON THE SNOWMOBILE. SO, WHEN YOU HAVE WATER IN YOUR GAS, IT GOES INTO THE FUEL PUMP, AND THEN IT FREEZES, SO FUEL DOESN'T COME THROUGH TO THE CARBURETOR. SO YOU PISS ON THE FUEL PUMP. IT WARMS IT UP AND MELTS THE ICE, AND THE GAS CAN COME THROUGH. YEAH, YEAH, THERE'S BEEN SOME HEADBUTTING BETWEEN RAGNAR AND I. JUST PISS ON THE **** FUEL PUMP! WE NEED TO GET GOING! IN 12 YEARS, I'VE FIRED HIM ABOUT EIGHT TIMES. JUST THAWED OUT. SEE, I **** TOLD YOU! IT WORKED! I TOLD YOU! IT'S AN OLD BUSH TRICK. WE USE IT ALL THE TIME. ON A SMALL ISLAND ACROSS THE BAY, RANDY SIBBESTON, A MEMBER OF THE INDIGENOUS MéTIS TRIBE, USES THE LAKE AS AN OUTDOOR CLASSROOM TO TEACH HIS CHILDREN THE WINTER SURVIVAL SKILLS NECESSARY FOR LIFE IN THE NORTH. BEING A CANADIAN RANGER HAS TAUGHT ME A LOT OF THINGS, AND ONE OF THEM IS THAT IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO BE PREPARED. IN WINTERTIME, OUT ON THE LAKE, THE CONDITIONS CAN BE VERY HARSH. AND I'VE BEEN TRYING TO TEACH MY KIDS THAT STEP BY STEP BECAUSE THIS IS A VERY UNFORGIVING ENVIRONMENT. NO ONE KNOWS MORE ABOUT SURVIVING THIS BRUTAL SUBARCTIC CLIMATE THAN RANDY. YOU PUT YOUR BIRCH BARK DOWN. AND THEN YOU NEED A FEW LITTLE DRY TWIGS. WOULD YOU GET SOME OF THOSE LITTLE BRANCHES OFF THE BOTTOM OF THAT LITTLE SPRUCE TREE? I'M TRYING AS BEST AS I CAN TO SHARE THOSE VALUES WITH MY KIDS NOW. AAH! OKAY, GOOD. LOOK, THERE'S A NICE PIECE OF... THERE'S SOME NICE, DRY WOOD. ALL KINDS OF GOOD STUFF THERE. I GOT SOME! HEY! OUT OF THE WAY! I GOT TO PUT SOME WOOD! JUST WAIT. JUST PUT IT DOWN THERE BESIDE IT. DON'T PUT IT ON THE FIRE YET 'CAUSE WE DON'T WANT THE FIRE TO GET SMOTHERED. YOU GOT TO LET IT... GIVE IT A CHANCE TO GROW FROM A LITTLE FIRE INTO A BIG FIRE. IT'S A BIG PART OF MY LIFE TO PASS ON THE TRADITIONAL HUNTING AND TRAPPING AND FISHING. LIVING LIFE ON A HOUSEBOAT IS A VERY... IS A LIFE CLOSE TO NATURE. YEAH. JUST BE CAREFUL NOT TO GET TOO CLOSE, 'CAUSE I DON'T WANT YOU TO BURN YOUR MITTS, OKAY? GOT A A BIG ONE. OKAY, GOOD. PUT IT ON THERE. IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S BEING LOST IN OUR MODERN SOCIETY. GOOD JOB. BACK IN YELLOWKNIFE BAY, ONE OF THE AREA'S ONLY COMMERCIAL FISHING PLANTS OPERATES OUT OF A 500-TON BARGE. SINCE FREEZE-UP LAST MONTH, FISHING STOCKS ARE AT AN ALL-TIME LOW, AND CO-OWNER HENRY JEWER WORKS NEARLY 365 DAYS A YEAR TRYING TO KEEP UP WITH THE COMMUNITY'S DEMANDS. WELL, THERE'S DANGER WHEN IT COMES VERY WINDY. WE'LL STILL PULL NETS AT 45 BELOW. WE FISH NO MATTER WHAT TYPE OF WEATHER IT IS... WINDY, RAIN, SNOW, SLEET... TRYING TO MAKE THE PUBLIC HAPPY AND PROVIDE FISH FOR EVERYBODY IN THE CITY. HEY, MY MAN. HOW'S IT GOING? NOT TOO BAD, HENRY. HOW ABOUT YOURSELF? TONIGHT, STEPHAN BEGINS HIS FIRST ALL-NIGHT SHIFT AS AN APPRENTICE FISHERMAN. THE WHAT? THE MANIFOLD. THE MANIFOLD? HE AND ALLYCE PREFER TO BARTER FOR GOODS, BUT NOW STEPHAN MUST EARN HARD CASH FOR THEIR SPRING WEDDING. I'M NOT STAYING OUT HERE TOO LONG, EITHER, MAN. GOOD TO SEE YOU, MAN. HOW ARE THINGS? PRETTY GOOD. I'M BROKE, AND EVERYTHING I'VE THOUGHT OF TO TRY TO MAKE MONEY HAS NOT WORKED OUT FOR ME. I CANNOT DISAPPOINT MY LOVELY WIFE-TO-BE, AND I DON'T CARE WHAT IT TAKES. I'M GONNA MAKE SOME MONEY 'CAUSE I'M DONE BEING POOR. YEAH, OKAY. ALL RIGHT, THANKS AGAIN, HENRY. TALK SOON. YEAH. STEPHAN REPORTS FOR DUTY TO CO-OWNER BRIAN ABBOTT. BRIAN HAS THE RISKIEST JOB IN THE BUSINESS... SETTING FISHING LINES MILES ACROSS THE FROZEN LAKE FAR FROM THE SHELTER OF THE BAY. HEY, HOW YOU DOING? YOU'RE ALL READY? WE'RE GONNA FIND OUT, WON'T WE? WELL, YOU'RE GONNA ENJOY THIS. I HOPE SO, 'CAUSE THEY'RE CALLING FOR -30. THE FISH ARE A LITTLE HARDER TO CATCH IN THE WINTER, SO YOU GOT TO WORK A LOT HARDER, RUN MORE NETS IN ORDER TO GET THE CUSTOMERS' DEMANDS MET. HAVE WE GOT ENOUGH FUEL HERE? YEP. YEAH. I'VE GOT PART OF A TANK HERE, AND I GRABBED ANOTHER FIVE GALLONS THERE, SO... FISH ON! FISH ON! THIS IS A RISKY BUSINESS. IT'S KIND OF LIKE FARMING, YOU KNOW. YOU'RE SLAVE TO THE WEATHER, SLAVE TO THE LAKE, SLAVE TO THE FISH. BRIAN'S NETS CLOSEST TO THE BAY ARE EMPTY, SO HE SETS NETS FARTHER AWAY IN SEARCH OF FISH. NOW HE AND STEPHAN WILL TRAVEL 40 MILES ACROSS THE OPEN LAKE IN HIGH WINDS FOR A FRIGID, EIGHT-HOUR SHIFT RETRIEVING FISH. THIS WIND IS BRUTAL. EVERYTHING IS FREEZING ALMOST INSTANTANEOUSLY. IT'S REALLY GETTING TO THE POINT OF BEING VERY DANGEROUS. AND I HATE TO GO TOO FAR FROM HOME IN THE DEAD OF WINTER. 'CAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT CAN HAPPEN OUT THERE. IF THERE'S A -40 WIND CHILL, YOUR SKIN'S GONNA FREEZE IN LESS THAN A MINUTE. STEPH, WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU? I'VE HEARD A LOT OF STORIES OF PEOPLE DYING ON THIS LAKE. AS DARKNESS FALLS OVER GREAT SLAVE LAKE AND TEMPERATURES DIP TO A BONE-CHILLING -30 DEGREES, FISHERMEN BRIAN AND STEPHAN HOPE THAT TONIGHT'S CATCH WILL BE WORTH THE RISK AFTER TRAVELING NEARLY 40 MILES FROM THE PROTECTION OF THE BAY. THAT WAS A COLD RIDE, BRIAN. IT IS FREAKIN' COLD OUT HERE, BROTHER. IT'S NOT ROCKET SCIENCE. YOU'LL GET ON THIS REAL EASY. YOU'RE NOT A STUPID MAN, SO... WELL, THAT'S UP FOR DEBATE. THIS WHOLE THING DUG UP? THE WHOLE THING THERE. YEP. STEPHAN AND BRIAN BEGIN BY SHOVELING OUT THE ICE THAT IS FROZEN OVER THE FISHING HOLE BRIAN HAD OPENED JUST HOURS EARLIER. ONCE THEY'VE BEEN CLEARED, THE MEN CAN PULL IN THE NETS AND SEE IF THEY'VE STRUCK GOLD. THE FASTER WE GET 'ER DONE, THE FASTER WE GET TO HEAT. STEPHAN'S GONNA LEARN JUST HOW HARD THIS CAN BE AS A FISHERMAN IN THE WINTER. IN ORDER TO GET DOWN TO THE FISH, WE'VE GOT TO HACK THROUGH QUITE A FEW FEET OF HARD ICE. WHAT I DO... YEAH? ...IF I CAN FIT THE SHOVEL DOWN THE HOLE AND HAVE A LITTLE, TINY BIT OF CLEARANCE, IT'S GOOD. OKAY. HERE, THE PIKE CAN GROW TO BE 30 POUNDS. STEPHAN MUST OPEN THE HOLE ENOUGH TO ACCOMMODATE THEIR SUPER SIZE. SO, THE WIDTH OF THE SHOVEL IS OUR BARE-MINIMUM SIZE. BARE MINIMUM, AND IF YOU'RE GETTING IT RIGHT, YOU'LL HEAR A THUNK SOUND, 'CAUSE YOU KNOW IT'S BUSTING THE ICE AT THAT POINT. THERE. THAT'S THE SOUND YOU WANT. YOU WILL FIND OUT WHETHER YOU WANT TO DO THIS AFTER THE END OF THE NIGHT. ONCE IT STARTS WARMING UP, DON'T EVER STAND WHERE YOU WERE STANDING, 'CAUSE YOU'RE STANDING ON THE HOLE. I WOULD HAVE WENT RIGHT THROUGH THE ICE? WELL, THERE'S ENOUGH ICE RIGHT NOW YOU DIDN'T GO THROUGH, BUT... REALLY? YEAH. IF IT HAD BEEN, YOU KNOW, LIKE, LATER IN THE YEAR, THAT'LL BE, YOU KNOW, JUST AN INCH OF ICE OR SOMETHING. REALLY? WITH SNOW OVER IT. YOU STEP ON IT... PFFT... DOWN YOU GO. HOLY **** I COULD HAVE BEEN DOWN THAT **** HOLE. YEAH, YOU'D HAVE HAD ONE LEG DOWN THERE AND WET. WE WOULD HAVE BEEN RUNNING YOU BACK TO CAMP TO WARM YOU UP IN A HURRY. ONCE YOU GOT THIS HOLE OPENED BACK UP, IF YOU HAPPEN TO FALL IN THERE, YOU'RE GONNA FREEZE TO DEATH REAL QUICK, 'CAUSE YOU'RE GONNA BE SOAKING WET. YOU GOT TO REALLY BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU'RE OUT HERE, MAN. YEAH. THIS IS REALLY HARD WORK, MAN. 30, -35, YOU'RE A FAR, LONG WAY FROM HOME. I MEAN, I COULDN'T FIND MY WAY HOME IF I WANTED TO RIGHT NOW. TOMORROW, I'M GONNA HAVE TO SLEEP A BIT. I CAN'T DO IT LIKE THIS. I KIND OF HAVE TO DO IT EVERY DAY. I'VE BEEN DOING IT EVERY DAY FOR, WELL, FOUR YEARS NOW. I HAVEN'T HAD A DAY OFF YET. IN FOUR YEARS? NOT A DAY OFF. THE LIFE OF A FISHERMAN IS A TOUGH LIFE. IT'S HARD. IT'S A LIFESTYLE. BUT IT'S REWARDING. I MEAN, YOU'RE OUT IN THE FRESH AIR. I MEAN, THIS IS JUST BEAUTIFUL OUT HERE. DON'T GET ME WRONG. COME SPRING, THIS IS GONNA BE ONE OF THE MOST GORGEOUS SPOTS IN THE WORLD OUT AMONGST THESE ISLANDS HERE. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. I CAN'T IMAGINE SITTING INSIDE AN OFFICE AT A COMPUTER. DRIVE ME NUTS. YEAH, I KNOW THE FEELING. OKAY, WE CAN START PULLING FISH. NICE. WE'RE ABOUT TO PULL OUR FIRST NET RIGHT NOW, AND I'M HOPING THIS THING IS JUST CHOCK RIGHT FULL. IT'S LIKE CHRISTMAS. YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GONNA GET TILL YOU OPEN IT UP. A SUDDEN COLD FRONT MOVES INTO YELLOWKNIFE BAY. THE CLOUDS ARE COMING. WEATHER IS CHANGING. AFTER A GRUELING DAY WORKING AT RAGNAR'S LODGE, PIKE MIKE AND NEIGHBOR MATTHEW GROGONO TRY TO CATCH SOME DINNER INDOORS UNDER THE PROTECTION OF A DOME BUILT BY MATTHEW. THE ART OF BUILDING A FIRE. IT'S ALL ABOUT THE KINDLING POINT. TINDER, THEN KINDLE. THE REASON WHY WE DEVELOPED THE ICE DOME... BEING OUT ON GREAT SLAVE LAKE IS SUPER DANGEROUS, BUT HAVING THE DOME OVER A COUPLE OF FISHING HOLES HERE, YOU CREATE A SHELTER, AND YOU'RE NOT STANDING OUT IN THE -40 WIND CHILL. THE TRAP WE SET THIS AFTERNOON, IT SEEMS TO BE VERY POSITIVE. MATTHEW GROGONO IS ONE OF THE ORIGINAL HOUSEBOATERS. WE PUT THIS LINE DOWN EARLIER TODAY... TWO HOURS AGO, THREE HOURS AGO. I SUSPECT THAT A FISH HAS TAKEN THE BAIT. I CAN FEEL HIM PULLING ON THE LINE. SO, THIS IS GREAT? WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO... WE'LL JUST TAKE THE WHEEL. I'LL PUT IT ASIDE. I'M GONNA HAND-BOMB THEM. EARLIER TODAY, A COUPLE... WHAT? I'VE GOT SOMETHING COMING. HERE IT COMES. YEAH, SURE ENOUGH, IT'S A LITTLE NORTHERN. MY GOSH. THAT'S A GOOD ONE, TOO. THAT'S A REAL NICE FISH. THERE YOU GO! RIGHT THERE. LOOK AT THAT. THAT'S A GOOD EATING SIZE. CLASSIC. BEAUTIFUL. ROWS OF TEETH LIKE A SHARK. WOW. PREDATOR FISH? ATE THE CISCO, FAVORITE FOOD. THESE ARE PROLIFIC IN THE LAKE. DO IT LIKE THIS. AND I'M GONNA SAW THROUGH THE RIBS RIGHT HERE, AND THEN I'LL TAKE THEM OFF AFTER. AND YOU DEFINITELY DON'T WANT TO CUT THE GALLBLADDER. YOU DON'T WANT TO PIERCE THAT 'CAUSE THAT'LL TAINT THE MEAT. DO THE OTHER SIDE. TWO PIKE FILLETS RIGHT THERE. FRIED FISH FOR DINNER. FAR FROM THE PROTECTION OF YELLOWKNIFE BAY, AFTER HOURS OF BONE-CHILLING WORK FOR BRIAN AND STEPHAN, IT'S TIME TO PULL THE NETS. SLIPPERY PART. HENRY AND I CAN GO BANKRUPT. THE FISHING HAS BEEN PRETTY SLIM. I'M A GUY THAT ALWAYS HOPES FOR FULL NETS. YOU CAN HOPE. IT DOESN'T ALWAYS HAPPEN. YOU DON'T HAVE TO PULL IT 100 MILES AN HOUR. IS THAT A GOOD SPEED? YEP. WHATEVER'S COMFORTABLE FOR YOU. I CAN GO FASTER. ONE WHITEFISH. YOU WANT ME TO GO FASTER? TWO WHITEFISH. LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THIS LITTLE SUCKER! WHITEFISH! COME ON, LITTLE BUDDY. WOW, I'VE BEEN DOING IT ALL WRONG, BRIAN. BRIAN'S NETS ARE TRIPLE HIS USUAL YIELD, ENOUGH TO HELP KEEP HIS AND HENRY'S CUSTOMERS WELL-FED... AT LEAST, FOR NOW. SPREAD THE NET OUT. AND YOU JUST KEEP WORKING IT THROUGH LIKE THAT. JUST SQUEEZE IT THROUGH THE NET, AND IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY RIP THE NET OR ANYTHING. NOT. NOT BARELY AT ALL. HE'S DONE ALL THE DAMAGE THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN. HEY, LITTLE BUDDY. PET YOUR FISH. YOU HAVE TO PET YOUR FISH. WE GONNA KISS THEM, TOO? GORGEOUS FISH! WE'RE SEEING TROUT, WE'RE SEEING CONEY. THE AMOUNT OF FISH WE'RE GETTING IS IMMENSE. IT'S BEAUTIFUL. THIS IS MY KIND OF FISHING. I THINK I CAN DO THIS. YOU ARE DOING IT. YEAH, I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT, BOSS. WE'RE COLD. HE'S TIRED. HE'S GOT THE OTHER END DONE THERE, SO I THINK I'M GONNA PACK UP THIS GEAR HERE, AND WE'RE GONNA HEAD BACK TO THE BARGE. I CAN JUMP IN A HOT SHOWER AND GET INTO BED. LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. OKAY. BRIAN AND STEPHAN MUST NOW HEAD BACK ON THEIR TWO-HOUR JOURNEY HOME, FACING THE BITTER, COLD WINDS IN TOTAL DARKNESS. BACK IN YELLOWKNIFE BAY... STEPHAN'S FIANCéE ALLYCE AWAITS HIS RETURN AND PREPARES FOR THE COLD NIGHT. WITH THE WEDDING COMING UP THIS SPRING, WE WERE STARTING TO REALLY GET WORRIED ABOUT MONEY, BUT IF WE REALLY BUCKLE DOWN, WE CAN DO IT. JUST MAKE SURE MY WATER PRESSURE IS ON. IT'S NOT. THERE WE GO. KNOWING THAT STEPHAN IS WILLING TO SACRIFICE AND DO WHATEVER HE CAN FOR OUR WEDDING... THAT SHOULD BE GOOD. ...IT MEANS A LOT TO ME. SO PROUD OF HIM. AS DAWN BREAKS AND AN UNEXPECTED OVERNIGHT SNOWSTORM FINALLY CLEARS... ...STEPHAN IS HOURS PAST HIS EXPECTED RETURN. STEPH WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IN HOURS AGO, AND NOW I HAVEN'T SLEPT. I... I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. NOW A WORRIED ALLYCE MAKES AN EARLY-MORNING VISIT TO THE NEIGHBORING FISH PLANT TO SEE IF BRIAN'S PARTNER, HENRY, HAS HEARD FROM HIM. HEY, HENRY. HI. HOW ARE YOU? HAVE YOU HEARD FROM STEPHAN AND BRIAN? A BRIGHT, COLD MORNING DAWNS OVER GREAT SLAVE LAKE. THE ONLY REMNANTS FROM LAST NIGHT'S SURPRISE STORM... A FRESH LAYER OF SNOW OVER YELLOWKNIFE BAY. STEPHAN HERVIEUX AND BRIAN ABBOTT HAVEN'T RETURNED FROM A NIGHT FISHING EXPEDITION ON THE OPEN LAKE. NOW STEPHAN'S FIANCéE, ALLYCE, SOUNDS THE ALARM. COME IN. HAVE YOU HEARD FROM STEPHAN AND BRIAN? NO, I HAVEN'T HEARD NOTHING SINCE YESTERDAY... LAST TIME I HEARD FROM THEM. THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE BACK LAST NIGHT, RIGHT? YEAH, THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN BACK LAST NIGHT. IT'S NOT GOOD THAT WE HAVE NO CONTACT WITH THEM AT ALL RIGHT NOW. I'VE HEARD A LOT OF STORIES OF PEOPLE DYING ON THIS LAKE. I THINK WE NEED TO GET ON THIS RIGHT AWAY AND TRY TO FIND THEM. WE'RE PROBABLY GONNA HAVE TO SEND SOMEBODY OUT LOOKING FOR THEM, I THINK. YEAH. JUST IN CASE. JUST IN CASE. IF EVERYTHING IS FINE, EVERYTHING IS FINE. YEAH, HERE'S HOPING. YEAH. IF YOU GET LOST OR ANYTHING, MAKE SURE YOU GET YOURSELF A SHELTER AND BUILD YOURSELF A BIG FIRE. WE'RE ALWAYS FULLY EQUIPPED WITH AXES AND MATCHES THAT'S WATERPROOF, SO THAT WAY, IF THEY CAN GET A FIRE GOING, SOMEONE WILL COME EVENTUALLY LOOKING FOR YOU, 'CAUSE EVERYBODY LOOKS OUT FOR EVERYBODY AROUND HERE. WE CAN ALWAYS TRY RANDY, I GUESS. I THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA. I'M SURE HE COULD GET A SEARCH PARTY GOING. STEPH AND BRIAN ARE TWO NORTHERN GUYS, AND AS LONG AS NEITHER OF THEM WERE HURT IN AN ACCIDENT, THEY'D BE OKAY. THEY COULD FIGURE OUT HOW TO STAY WARM. BUT SUCCUMBING TO EXPOSURE CAN HAPPEN ON A MOMENT'S NOTICE. I'LL CALL RANDY RIGHT NOW AND GET IT GOING. AND I'LL KEEP IN TOUCH WITH YOU, TOO. OKAY. ALL RIGHT. ALLYCE HAS ENLISTED THE HELP OF RANDY SIBBESTON WHO BRINGS HIS SKILLS AS A WILDLIFE GAME HUNTER AND TRACKER TO THE SEARCH. I'VE BEEN A CANADIAN RANGER FOR 12 YEARS NOW. A BIG PART OF THE RANGERS IS TO BE READY, TO BE ABLE TO GO OUT AND SEARCH FOR SOMEBODY, SO SEARCH AND RESCUE IS A PART OF MY JOB, REALLY. I'VE BEEN IN ALL KINDS OF TOUGH SITUATIONS IN DIFFERENT CLIMATES, AND THAT FREEZING LAKE WATER IS THE LAST PLACE THAT I WANT TO BE. HE TRAVELS FIVE MILES ACROSS THE LAKE TO TAP PIKE MIKE AS HIS PARTNER. RANDY, MY GOOD MAN! HOW ARE YOU? WHAT'S GOING ON? I WAS JUST TALKING TO ALLYCE, AND SHE SAID THAT BRIAN AND STEPHAN ARE NOT BACK YET FROM CHECKING THE NETS. THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN BACK LAST NIGHT? THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN BACK LAST NIGHT. SO, SHE ASKED ME IF I WOULD GO AND TAKE A LOOK AND SEE IF I COULD FIND THEM AND MAKE SURE THEY'RE OKAY, CHECK ON THEM. YOU NEED SOME SUPPORT, I GUESS. YEAH, I SURE COULD USE A HAND. LET'S TAKE A QUICK LOOK AT THE MAP, AND THEN WE'LL FIGURE OUT WHAT THE BEST THING TO DO IS. THE NUMBER-ONE THING THAT WILL GET YOU IS EXPOSURE TO THE ELEMENTS OVER A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME. IF THERE'S A -40 WIND CHILL, YOUR SKIN'S GONNA FREEZE IN LESS THAN A MINUTE. WHERE'S HE SETTING NETS RIGHT NOW? OUT BY WOOL BAY. I THINK THEY'RE OUT, BUT THEY WERE HEADED NORTH FROM THERE, I BELIEVE. OKAY, SO THEN WOOL BAY. PROBABLY RIGHT ABOUT THERE WOULD BE A GOOD PLACE TO START. THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT ARE JUST REAL CONSTANT DANGERS WHILE YOU'RE OUT ON THE LAKE. THERE'S ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE BROKEN THROUGH THE ICE IN CERTAIN PLACES, PEOPLE THAT HAVE DROWNED OVER THE YEARS. OVER A LIFETIME OF HEARING STORIES AS WARNINGS, YOU KNOW, TO PEOPLE WHO ARE USING THE LAKE, TO BE CAREFUL JUST SO THAT THE LAKE DOESN'T CLAIM ANOTHER VICTIM. YOU CAN CHECK ALONG THE SHORELINE, AND I'LL GO TAKE A LOOK A LITTLE FARTHER OUT ON THE LAKE. AND THEN MEET AT THE INTERSECTION. AND THEN MEET BACK AT THE INTERSECTION. ALL RIGHT. NO TIME TO WASTE. LET'S GO FIND THOSE GUYS. RANDY AND MIKE TARGET THE TWO MOST LIKELY PLACES TO QUICKLY FIND THE MISSING MEN. PIKE MIKE DRIVES ALONG THE MAIN ICE ROAD TOWARDS CAMP WHERE THEY MAY HAVE BROKEN DOWN WHILE RANDY SEARCHES THE FISH CAMP AND NEARBY ISLAND, WHERE THEY COULD BE SHELTERING FROM THE SEVERE WEATHER AFTER AN INJURY, ANIMAL ATTACK, OR MECHANICAL FAILURE. BEING OUT ON THE BIG LAKE IS AN INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS PLACE TO BE IN THE WINTERTIME BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT INCREDIBLY COLD WEATHER, AND THERE'S NOTHING TO PROTECT YOU FROM THE WIND. I'VE SEEN GUYS WITH FROSTBITE SO BAD THAT THEIR SKIN IS BLISTERING, AND THEY HAD TO BE HOSPITALIZED FOR IT. I'M OUT ON THE LAKE AND LOOKING FOR A LIGHT, LOOKING FOR A FIRE, LOOKING FOR FRESH TRACKS, LOOKING FOR ANY SIGN OF THEM, AND I CAN'T FIND ANYTHING. WHERE DID THEY GO? JUST A WHOLE LOT OF FROZEN NOTHING. THE LAKE IS UNFORGIVING TO THOSE WHO DON'T OBEY ITS RULES. LAST NIGHT, STEPHAN AND BRIAN WENT MISSING ON AN OVERNIGHT FISHING EXPEDITION AFTER AN UNEXPECTED SNOWSTORM HIT. VETERAN SURVIVAL GUIDE PIKE MIKE SEARCHES FOR THEIR SNOWMOBILE TRACKS ALONG THE MAIN ICE ROAD. THERE WAS A HECK OF A STORM LAST NIGHT, SO ALL THE TRACKS ARE BLOWN OVER. NOBODY SAW THAT STORM COMING IN. IT WASN'T EVEN FORECASTED TO ANY GREAT DEGREE. WE KNOW WE DON'T HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANT TRAIL TO FOLLOW. I HOPE HE'S GOT A SIGNAL MIRROR WITH HIM. THAT WOULD MAKE FINDING THEM A LOT EASIER. THERE'S NOT A SIGN OF THEM ANYWHERE HERE. NO TRACKS GOING OFF IN ANY DIRECTION. THE HARSH CANADIAN WINTERS CLAIM MORE THAN 80 SOULS EACH YEAR DUE TO EXPOSURE. BUT WILD ANIMALS ARE A DANGER, AS WELL. STEPHAN AND BRIAN HAVE NOW BEEN EXPOSED LONG ENOUGH THAT SEVERE FROSTBITE AND HYPOTHERMIA ARE LEGITIMATE CONCERNS. KEY THING IS WHEN YOU'RE STRANDED, STAY PUT. USE THE RESOURCES AROUND YOU. SET UP SIGNALS. FIND A WATER SOURCE. STAY PUT. WITH MIKE COMING UP EMPTY ON THE MAIN ICE ROAD, RANDY CONTINUES TO CANVASS THE ISLANDS NEAR THE FISH CAMP WHERE STEPHAN AND BRIAN MAY HAVE SOUGHT SHELTER. I HAD FIGURED THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN AN OPEN-AND-SHUT, QUICK AND EASY THING TO FIND THOSE GUYS, SO IT'S A SCARY FEELING, YOU KNOW, AND THE WEIGHT OF THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THOSE PEOPLE'S SAFETY. IT WEIGHS ON MY SHOULDERS. IT'S SUPER CRITICAL. YOU DON'T LAST LONG OUT THERE IF YOU'RE NOT ADEQUATELY PREPARED. HYPOTHERMIA, FROSTBITE EXPOSURE, DEHYDRATION, POTENTIAL INJURY, MECHANICAL BREAKDOWN... A NUMBER OF THINGS COULD HAVE GONE WRONG. HOPEFULLY HE'S GOT SOME GOOD NEWS. ANYTHING? I HAVEN'T SEEN A SIGN, MAN. LIKEWISE. I'VE BEEN OUT LOOKING, YOU'VE BEEN OUT LOOKING, AND NOTHING SO FAR. BEEN OUT THERE ALL NIGHT. YOU HOPE TO FIND THESE GUYS WHILE YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THEM IN THE DAYTIME, BECAUSE WHEN THAT TEMPERATURE DROPS 20, 30 DEGREES OVERNIGHT, THEIR CHANCES OF SURVIVING GO WAY DOWN. LET'S GET A MAJOR SEARCH AND RESCUE GOING HERE. GONNA HAVE TO. ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET BACK TO THE FISH PLANT. OKAY, I'M FOLLOWING YOU. GREAT SLAVE LAKE SPANS 10,502 SQUARE MILES. RANDY AND MIKE HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING WHAT HAPPENED TO STEPHAN AND BRIAN, ONLY THAT THEIR CHANCES OF SURVIVAL ARE MUCH LOWER AT NIGHT. A LARGER SEARCH PARTY IS URGENTLY NEEDED. NOW AS TEMPERATURES DIP AGAIN INTO THE -30s, THE SUN IS SET OVER YELLOWKNIFE BAY. HEY, GUYS. STEPHAN'S FIANCéE, ALLYCE, AND NEIGHBOR GREG MEET RANDY AND PIKE MIKE AT THE FISH PLANT. YEAH, I GOT SOME WARM STUFF. HEY, ALLYCE. HEY. IT FREAKS ME OUT THAT RANDY AND MIKE HAVEN'T FOUND STEPH YET. THEY KNOW THIS LAKE. I NEED TO GET OUT THERE AND HELP, JOIN THE SEARCH. IT'S ALL I CAN DO. THOSE GUYS HAVE BEEN MISSING, SO WE NEED TO TAKE A GOOD LOOK FOR THEM, AND I'M GLAD THAT YOU'RE ABLE TO SHOW... OKAY. YEAH, I'M READY ANY TIME. YOU KNOW, HOW SHOULD WE SPREAD OUT HERE? WE TALKED IT OVER AND QUICKLY DECIDED THAT WE WERE GONNA NEED TO EXPAND OUR SEARCH AND INVOLVE AS MANY PEOPLE AS WE COULD MUSTER IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE GUYS DIDN'T HAVE TO SPEND ANOTHER NIGHT OUT IN THE BUSH. MAYBE WE CAN SEND RAGNAR OUT TO LOOK IN THE BIG LAKE, AND WE CAN CONCENTRATE MORE ON THE SHORELINE. FOR ADDED MANPOWER, RANDY RADIOS 35 MILES ACROSS THE LAKE TO RAGNAR WESSTROM, AN EXPERIENCED WINTER SURVIVALIST. RAGNAR, THIS IS SnoBear. DO YOU COPY? YEAH, IT'S TROUT ROCK LODGE HERE. RAGNAR SPEAKING. RAGNAR, WE'VE GOT A COUPLE OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN MISSING OVERNIGHT, AND WE NEED A LITTLE BIT OF HELP TO GO AND LOOK FOR THEM. Yeah? No worries, Randy. We're gonna help you out. DO YOU HAVE ANY COORDINATES WHEN YOU LAST HEARD FROM THEM? IT'S NORTH 62.27856... AND WEST 114.246879. I will take off here shortly. HOPEFULLY EVERYTHING WORKS OUT. THANKS SO MUCH, RAGNAR. I'LL KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR YOU, AND YOU'LL SEE US. IN TIMES LIKE THESE, YOU REALLY DEPEND ON YOUR NEIGHBORS. IN THE NORMAL WORLD, WHEN SOMEONE GOES MISSING, YOU CALL 911. BUT HERE ON THE LAKE, WE DON'T PAY TAXES, SO WE GOT TO DO IT. LUCKILY WE'VE GOT HUNTERS AND TRAPPERS AND A LOT OF PEOPLE, HENRY, AND EVERYONE WHO KNOWS THIS LAKE BETTER THAN ANYTHING, SO WE GOT TO GET A GROUP TOGETHER AND GO FIND THEM. FIND YOUR PAPA. LET'S GO. THE LAKE'S AN INCREDIBLY DEMANDING BODY OF WATER, YOU KNOW, THAT'S TAKEN MANY LIVES OVER THE YEARS OF BETTER MEN THAN ME. THE SEARCH PARTY DIVIDES THE LAKE INTO QUADRANTS. ALLYCE, MIKE, AND GREG WILL SCOUR A LARGER AREA NEAREST TO BRIAN'S FISH CAMP. RANDY WILL COVER MORE OF THE ISLANDS AROUND WOOL BAY... WHILE RAGNAR WESSTROM AND HIS GUIDES WILL SEARCH THE OPEN LAKE NORTH OF THE FISH CAMP NEAR BAKER ISLAND. THIS IS WHERE THEY USUALLY FISH. RIGHT. THEY MUST BE BETWEEN BAKER ISLAND AND THE LODGE. HIS FIANCéE IS ALL UPSET, SO WE BETTER GET AT THIS RIGHT AWAY. SO, OKAY, LET'S GET READY. LET'S GET EVERYTHING PACKED UP HERE. DAMN, IT'S COLD OUT THERE. - 46. RAGNAR BRINGS HIS FLEET OF FULLY AMPHIBIOUS ALL-TERRAIN VEHICLES CALLED HAGGLUNDS TO THE RESCUE MISSION, A VALUABLE ASSET. GOOD. ALL SYSTEMS GO. LET'S ROLL. LET'S FIND THESE POOR SOULS BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE. WE GOT -46, SO LET'S HEAD FOR BAKER LAKE FIRST. Roger that. WE'RE JUST GONNA GO ON THE VIRGIN SNOW HERE, SO WE HAVE NO TRAIL WHATSOEVER, SO WE JUST HAVE TO FOLLOW THE COASTLINE, AND AND WE DON'T WANT TO GET LOST OURSELVES OUT HERE, OKAY? SO YOU STICK CLOSE TOGETHER FOR NOW. THE HAGGLUND BV206 IS THE MOST VERSATILE VEHICLE IN THE WORLD. IT'S FULLY AMPHIBIOUS. WHEN PEOPLE NEED OUR HELP, WE'RE ALWAYS THERE BECAUSE WE'RE IN ROADLESS COUNTRY. THERE IS NO PEOPLE DOWN HERE. THERE'S NO ROAD ACCESS, NOTHING. SO WE GET QUITE A FEW CALLS. WE'RE ALWAYS HERE TO HELP OUT. KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN FOR FIRES. IF THEY'RE STRANDED SOMEWHERE, THEY MAY HAVE MADE A FIRE. FORTUNATELY WE NEVER HAD TO PICK UP SOMEBODY THAT DIDN'T MAKE IT. WE GOT TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN NOW TO FIND THESE TWO MISSING FISHERMEN, AND WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME. IN SUBARCTIC CANADA, WHERE WINTER TEMPERATURES OF -40 DEGREES CAN CAUSE FROSTBITE IN TWO MINUTES, BRIAN AND STEPHAN HAVE BEEN EXPOSED FOR 24 HOURS. STEPHAN'S FIANCéE, ALLYCE, MARSHALLED THE ICE LAKE COMMUNITY TO SEARCH FOR HER HUSBAND-TO-BE. NOW SHE, MIKE, AND GREG SEARCH THE AREA NEAR THE FISHERMEN'S LAST LOCATION WHILE RANDY TRAVERSES THE SMALL SURROUNDING ISLANDS ON A SNOWMOBILE. AND RAGNAR WESSTROM CANVASSES THE OPEN LAKE TO THE NORTH IN HIS MIGHTY HAGGLUND VEHICLES. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE FIND THEM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, AND HOPEFULLY THEY'RE STILL ALIVE. BUT THERE'S NO GUARANTEE IN THIS BRUTAL WEATHER. IT'S ACTUALLY A RACE AGAINST TIME, BECAUSE IF THEY'RE INJURED, BROKEN LEG OR BROKEN LIMBS, IT'D BE A HARD TIME FOR THEM TO SURVIVE. AND EVEN WORSE, IF THEY HIT THE OVERFLOW, MAYBE THEY'RE WET. OVERFLOW IS A STREAM OF WATER SITTING ATOP A FROZEN LAKE CAMOUFLAGED BY A LAYER OF SNOW. FALLING IN QUICKLY SAPS BODY HEAT, LEADING TO HYPOTHERMIA. IF YOU GET WET IN OVERFLOW IN -46, WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT HOURS. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MINUTES BEFORE YOU'RE GONE. ACROSS THE ICE, ALLYCE AND PIKE MIKE SCOUR THE FRIGID TUNDRA BUT SEE NO SIGN OF LIFE. ALLYCE. DID STEPH SAY ANYTHING TO YOU BEFORE HE LEFT IN TERMS OF ALTERNATIVE FISHING LOCATIONS, THE SECOND CAMP? I MEAN, WHAT WAS THE LAST THING HE SAID BEFORE HE LEFT? NO, THEY WERE JUST GOING TO THE MAIN CAMP. IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IN AND OUT. HE WASN'T WORRIED ABOUT IT AT ALL. ALLYCE IS SITTING ACROSS FROM ME THERE, AND I CAN JUST FEEL THE WEIGHT OF IT ON HER. THE CONCERN IS JUST FILLING THIS LITTLE CABIN, THE SnoBear. YOU THINK THEY'D HAVE A SIGNAL FLARE OUT OR SOMETHING RIGHT NOW, YOU KNOW, A FIRE OR SOMETHING ANYWHERE DOWN THE SHORELINE HERE, BUT NO SIGN ANYWHERE. ANY TRACKS, GREG? NO, NOTHING AT ALL. ALL I'M RUNNING ON RIGHT NOW IS FAITH... FAITH THAT STEPH AND BRIAN ARE OKAY, FAITH THAT WE'LL SEE FIRE OR SMOKE OR ANYTHING, AND MY LOVE FOR STEPH... WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT. Yeah, no sign of them near Wool Bay. Over. AS THE HOURS PASS, RANDY PUSHES HIMSELF INTO EXHAUSTION AS THE 35-MILE-PER-HOUR ICY WINDS BATTER HIS SNOWMOBILE. IT'S 2:00 A.M., AND IT'S -45 BELOW ZERO. THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT COULD BE GOING WRONG WITH THOSE GUYS. RIGHT NOW, THEY COULD BE DEHYDRATED. THEY COULD BE HYPOTHERMIC. THEY COULD BE INJURED. THEY COULD BE PANICKING. PEOPLE DIE DUE TO EXPOSURE ALL THE TIME IN THE NORTH. FOR THAT TO HAPPEN TO FRIENDS OF MINE WOULD BE UNTHINKABLE TO ME. LOOK. IT'S A LIGHT. HEY, STEPH! WE'RE OVER HERE! THANK GOD! STEPH! ARE WE GLAD TO SEE YOU, MAN. I THOUGHT I WAS DONE FOR. I NEVER THOUGHT I'D HAVE TO **** WE LOOKED FOR YOU AND LOOKED FOR YOU GUYS, BUT YOU GUYS WERE OFF YOUR BEATEN TRAIL. WELL, I WAS LOOKING FOR HIGH GROUND. WE HAD A FIRE, WE HAD A TARP, WE HAD A COUPLE BLANKETS. WE'VE BEEN EATING SNOW FOR **** 28 HOURS. YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW WORRIED ALLYCE IS ABOUT YOU. SHE'S GONNA BE SO HAPPY. IT'S BEEN A REALLY LONG DAY. IT'S BEEN A LONG SEARCH. WE'VE COVERED A LOT OF MILES, AND WE JUST TRIED OUR BEST, AND VERY HAPPY TO SEE THOSE GUYS SAFE AND SOUND. WELL, IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU GUYS ARE ALL RIGHT. THAT'S THE MAIN THING. WE ENDED UP WITH DIESEL INSTEAD OF GASOLINE. I DIDN'T CHECK THE CANS, AND WE DIDN'T RUN THEM MUCH. MY GOODNESS. I POURED THE DIESEL IN, AND WE DIDN'T GO VERY FAR, AND SHE STARTED SPUTTING, AND THAT WAS IT. WELL, THANK GOD YOU GUYS ARE ALL RIGHT. I BETTER GIVE ALLYCE A CALL AND GREG OVER AT THE SNOW CAT, 'CAUSE... SHE MUST BE WORRIED SICK. I CAME TO TERMS WITH THE FACT THAT I WOULD PROBABLY DIE. I'VE NEVER BEEN LOST BEFORE, AND I'VE NEVER BEEN FOUND BEFORE. I'M JUST REALLY HAPPY THAT I MADE IT. THIS IS RANDY CALLING SnoBear. YOU BY? Yeah, Randy. Go ahead. **** HEY, GOOD WORK, RANDY. I WAS JUST SO EXHAUSTED FROM WORRYING FOR DAYS. I JUST WENT NUMB. I HEARD THAT HE WAS OKAY, AND EVERYTHING ELSE BLURRED OUT, AND I JUST PUT MY HEAD IN MY HANDS AND WAS JUST SO THANKFUL. We're at 20 miles out of town if you guys just follow the tracks. Okay. Roger that. ROGER THAT. WE GOT THEM. THANKS AGAIN, MAN. IT'S ALL OVER NOW, GUYS. YOU GUYS GET A HOT SHOWER TONIGHT FOR SURE. THE ONLY THING THAT KEPT US GOING WAS THAT FIRE. RAGNAR, YOU BY? YEAH, GO AHEAD THERE, RANDY. RAGNAR HERE. Hey, you know what, you can stand down. We got some great news. WE FOUND STEPHAN AND BRIAN. BOTH OF THOSE GUYS ARE FINE. Thanks very much, Ragnar. Talk to you later. **** I'M SO GLAD THEY FOUND THEM. THAT'S THE BEST NEWS I GOT IN A LONG TIME. AFTER STEPHAN HERVIEUX AND BRIAN ABBOTT WENT MISSING WHILE ICE FISHING ON GREAT SLAVE LAKE... THANKS AGAIN, MAN. IT'S ALL OVER NOW, GUYS. ...THEIR HOUSEBOATING COMMUNITY RALLIED FOR A GRUELING 20-HOUR HUNT. IN THE WEE HOURS OF THE SUBARCTIC MORNING, THEY ARE FOUND, AND STEPHAN WILL FINALLY BE REUNITED WITH HIS FIANCéE. HI, MAMA! YOU SCARED ME! MY FUTURE WIFE COMES OUT OF THE SnoBear. I SEE THE CONCERN ON HER FACE. WE HUG, WE CRY, WE KISS. MAN, IT FELT SO GOOD TO HOLD HER IN MY ARMS. THANKS FOR COMING. COLD. WE JUST HUGGED AND... JUST HAPPY TO BE ABLE TO TOUCH EACH OTHER AGAIN. THANKS FOR COMING. WE HAD A DISASTER. RANDY BROUGHT HOT TEA FOR YOU GUYS. WHAT HAPPENED? I POURED THE DIESEL IN THE SLED. IT DIED. IT'S A GAS SLED. GOOD THING YOU GUYS ARE ALL RIGHT, MAN. LIKE, THAT'S CRAZY. WE GOT FRESH, FROZEN FISH, THOUGH. GOOD! THAT'S THE ONLY GOOD THING I SEE OUT OF THIS. I SEE BRIAN RIGHT AWAY, AND THE FIRST THING HE SAYS TO ME IS LIKE, "WHAT A GOOD CATCH WE GOT," YOU KNOW? HE STARTS TALKING ABOUT THE FISH. THE GUY IS JUST, YOU KNOW, LIKE NOTHING EVER HAPPENED. LET'S GET YOU IN WHERE IT'S WARM. LET'S GET YOU BACK TO TOWN, GET YOU FED. LET'S GO, YOU GUYS. WE FOUND YOU. THANKS, MIKE. THANKS, PIKE MIKE. YOU GUYS. COME ON, MAN. I'LL MEET YOU GUYS BACK OVER THERE. GOOD JOB, RANDY. TURN UP THE HEAT! MAN. GOOD JOB, MIKE. YEAH, YEAH. ANYONE WHO LIVES ON GREAT SLAVE LAKE, FISHES ON GREAT SLAVE LAKE, KNOWS, LOVES, RESPECTS THE LAKE. GO! WE'RE GOING HOME! GEEZ! THIS IS THE COMMUNITY THAT WE LIVE IN. IF YOU GO MISSING, SOMEBODY'S GONNA MISS YOU, AND THEY WILL COME FOR YOU. THIS IS MY FAMILY. THIS IS MY HOME. I COULDN'T HAVE CARRIED ANY MORE.
