 FOR THE BEST, MOST SPECIAL WEDDING EVER. FOR THE REBELS, IT'S A SEASON OF CHANGE. SOME HOUSEBOATERS ARE CONTENT TO PUT DOWN THEIR MOORINGS AND STAY THERE FOR 30 YEARS. BUT ME... I'M MOBILE. I THINK I PICKED A GOOD SPOT. NOW THAT I'VE BEEN LIVING ON THE MOLLY BARGE FOR A FEW MONTHS, I'VE HAD TO TAKE CARE OF A LOT MORE THINGS THAN I EVER DID BEFORE. BUT IT'S ALSO A SEASON OF DANGER. HOLY **** LOOK AT THAT, LOOK AT THAT. LOOK AT THAT WATER COMING UP. I DON'T LIKE THIS. ARE WE GONNA HIT IT?

 YES. IT'S RIGHT HERE. **** MY STEERING JUST STRIPPED. HOLY **** ON GREAT SLAVE LAKE, MOST OF YELLOWKNIFE BAY IS NOW FREE FROM WINTER'S ICY GRIP. WINTER HANGS ON FOR SO LONG, AND THEN IT FINALLY LETS GO. AND IT'S LIKE A NEW BEGINNING OUT HERE. AFTER A LONG FREEZE, THE LAKE IS ALIVE AND IN MOTION. SPRING, YOU'VE GOT GOOD WEATHER, SUNSHINE. THE BIRDS START COMING OUT. EVERYTHING COMES ALIVE. IT'S A REALLY BEAUTIFUL TIME OF YEAR UP HERE. THE HOUSEBOATERS PREPARE FOR THE CHALLENGES OF LIFE ON THE LIQUID LAKE. I WORRY ABOUT THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO, BUT I ALSO TAKE ACTION. THE MAIN REWARD I GET FROM THIS LIFESTYLE IS THE SENSE OF INDEPENDENCE AND THE ABILITY TO MEET DIFFICULT CHALLENGES HEAD ON. IN YELLOWKNIFE BAY, BUSH PILOT GARY VAILLANCOURT SPENT THE WINTER GIVING HIS NEWLY RETURNED DAUGHTER, MOLLY MacKINNON, A CRASH COURSE IN LIVING OFF THE GRID ON A HOUSEBOAT. YOU GONNA BE OKAY? I HOPE SO. AFTER SEVEN MONTHS'S TRAINING, HE'S FINALLY READY TO LEAVE HER IN CHARGE OF HIS THREE VESSELS, THE MOLLY, AURORA, AND THE CT BARGE. ARE YOU EXCITED? I'M EXCITED. MY DAD'S ALWAYS AROUND TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING'S WORKING, SO THIS IS GONNA BE A NEW EXPERIENCE FOR ME. I'M KIND OF NERVOUS. HOW EXCITING. MOLLY'S COME ALONG REALLY, REALLY WELL IN TERMS OF LEARNING HOW TO LOOK AFTER HERSELF AND LOOK AFTER THE HOUSEBOAT. I LOVE THE RHYTHM OF PADDLING TOGETHER. IT'S SORT OF A... A DANCE. MOLLY DRIVES HER DAD TO THE AIRPORT THE NORTHERN WAY. TO LAND DWELLERS, SEAPLANES MAY SEEM EXTRAVAGANT. OKAY, STOP PADDLING. BUT FOR THOSE WHO LIVE ON THIS MASSIVE LAKE, IT'S A COMMON MODE OF TRANSPORTATION. FLOATPLANES ARE... THEY'RE KIND OF THE WORKHORSE OF THE NORTH HERE. YOU CAN'T GO ANYWHERE WITHOUT A FLOATPLANE. SO FLOATPLANES ARE ESSENTIAL. NOW, THE HOUSE... I THINK EVERYTHING'S OKAY. YOU THINK? WELL, AS BEST... YOU KNOW, I DID... ALL THE ROPES ARE TIED. I CHECKED EVERYTHING. BUT YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN. I'M COUNTING ON YOU TO LOOK AFTER THAT PLACE, OKAY? OKAY, DAD. DON'T BURN IT DOWN. YOU KNOW, THAT'D BE THE WORST. SECOND WORST IS SINKING IT. AND THIRD WORST IS DIRTY DISHES. SO DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. MAYBE THE THIRD WORST THEN. I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU, TOO, HONEY. YOU TAKE CARE, ALL RIGHT? AND I'LL SEE YOU SOON. IT'S A LOT OF RESPONSIBILITY, AND I REALLY HOPE SOMETHING DOESN'T BREAK. BYE, DAD. LOVE YOU. BYE, HONEY. ON A HOUSEBOAT, ANYTHING CAN GO WRONG AT ANY MOMENT. IF THERE'S, LIKE, CATASTROPHIC, LIKE AN ANCHOR FAILURE, WELL, THAT WOULD REQUIRE SOME EXTRA HELP. FOR MY WORK OVER THE YEARS, I'VE HAD TO LEAVE THE FAMILY A LOT AND I'VE NEVER REALLY EVER GOT USED TO IT. TAKING OFF IN THAT AIRPLANE AND SEEING HER IN THE CANOE... IT JUST BREAKS YOUR HEART, EVEN AFTER ALL THESE YEARS. WHILE SPRING INVITES MORE SEAPLANE TRAFFIC TO THE LAKE, INDIVIDUALIST "PIKE" MIKE HARRISON ISN'T AS WELCOMING TO WHAT THAT CHANGE IN SEASON BRINGS TO HIS BACKYARD. YOU KNOW, LAKESIDE LIVING, TO ME, IS THE CALL OF THE LOON AND THE WATER LAPPING AGAINST THE SHORE, NOT THE ROAR OF A PISTON-BEAVER OR A TURBO OTTER. IT'S JUST TOO CONGESTED HERE IN THE CHANNEL. YOU NEED A LITTLE BIT OF SPACE AROUND YOU SO YOU CAN HEAR THE BIRDS SINGING AND STUFF. YOU CAN'T GET THAT HERE. THIS IS THE INDUSTRIAL AREA. IT'S THE BUSIEST PART OF THE BAY. NOW, I GET OUT THERE ON THE OUTSKIRTS, I'LL BE ALL BY MY LONESOME. NOW IT'S TIME TO MOVE OUT OF IT. THE REBELS OF GREAT SLAVE LAKE PRIZE FREEDOM ABOVE ALL ELSE. AND WITH A FLOATING HOME, THAT INCLUDES THE FREEDOM TO HOIST ANCHOR AND SET SAIL FOR A NEW LOCATION EACH SPRING. SOME HOUSEBOATERS ARE CONTENT TO PUT DOWN THEIR MOORINGS AND STAY THERE FOR MAYBE 30 YEARS. BUT ME... I'M MOBILE, FLEXIBLE. I HAVE A LOT OF OPTIONS AND A LOT OF VERSATILITY. TODAY, HIS MISSION IS TO FIND THE PERFECT SPOT. THIS LOCAL, SEMI-URBAN HOUSEBOAT COMMUNITY HERE... EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE OFF GRID, THEY HAVE ALL THE MODERN CONVENIENCES. BUT THE TRUE WAY TO LIVE IN THE NORTH IS THE TRADITIONAL WAY, LIVING A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A SUSTAINABLE LIFESTYLE. LOOK AT THIS. I'VE GOT TO FIND A NAME FOR THIS LITTLE COVE HERE. THIS IS THE SPOT. BUT MY ONE CONCERN IS THE HEAVY WATER THAT BLOWS DOWN FROM THE SOUTH HERE. GOT ABOUT 150 MILES OF FETCH THERE, AND YOU GOT SOME BIG, BIG WATER COMING IN THE BAY HERE IF THE WIND DIRECTION IS RIGHT. MIKE HAS CHOSEN A COVE AT THE FARTHEST POINT BEFORE THE PROTECTED BAY MEETS THE TREACHEROUS WATERS OF THE OPEN LAKE. I'M DEPENDENT ON THAT 2-FOOT ROCK WALL AS A BREAK WALL FOR THE HEAVY SEAS THAT ARE GONNA COME IN FROM THE SOUTH AS THE SEASON PROGRESSES. THAT'S MY NUMBER-ONE CONCERN. ACROSS THE BAY, SPRING IS WHEN EVERYTHING THAT WAS FROZEN INTO THE LAKE CAN NOW FINALLY BE MOVED. FIANCéS STEPHAN HERVIEUX AND ALLYCE RATTRAY NEED TO MOVE THEIR WANDERING MOORING LINE. HEY, HON. HEY, HON. HOW ARE YOU? WHAT ARE YOU DOING? TRYING TO REPOSITION OUR ANCHORS. THEIR WEDDING IS SCHEDULED AT THE END OF THE WEEK. PERMISSION TO BOARD. BUT, FIRST, THESE NORTHERNERS MUST SECURE THEIR HOME, SETTING A NEW FOUNDATION FOR MARRIED LIFE TOGETHER. ALLYCE... SHE'S ONE SPECIAL GIRL. I MEAN, SHE'S NOT YOUR TYPICAL CHICK AT ALL. I WOULDN'T BE MARRYING SOME NORMAL CHICK. THEY BROKE THE MOLD WHEN THEY MADE HER. YOU KNOW HOW THIS THING WORKS? NEVER DONE IT BEFORE IN MY LIFE. THE ANCHOR'S THE ONLY THING THAT KEEPS US IN PLACE. YOU HAVE TO HAVE AT LEAST FOUR. YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE ALL OF YOUR LINES ARE DEEP ENOUGH OR WELL-MARKED ENOUGH THAT THEY'RE NOT GONNA HOOK IN SOMEBODY'S MOTOR. SO, YOU'VE GOT YOUR VESSEL. YOU GOT FOUR MOORING POINTS. THERE ARE ANCHORS ON ALL FOUR POINTS. I NEED TO MAKE SURE MY HOUSE IS NOT GONNA RAM INTO MY NEIGHBOR. IN ORDER TO PULL UP THE 500-POUND ANCHOR FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE LAKE, STEPHAN AND ALLYCE EMPLOY A HOMEMADE PULLEY, NICKNAMED "THE ANCHOR YANKER." THE HOUSEBOATERS OF GREAT SLAVE... THEY'VE DESIGNED AND BUILT THIS THING THAT ANYBODY IN THE COMMUNITY CAN USE. BEING A HOUSEBOATER... YOU ARE TAKING CARE OF EVERYTHING. THERE AIN'T NOBODY YOU CAN CALL TO COME AND YANK YOUR ANCHORS. - I GOT IT. - YOU GOT IT? WICKED! IT'S IN THERE. NOW FOR THE FUN PART. EVERY PULL YOU DO, YOUR SIDE GOES LOWER. YEAH. YEAH. **** AS ANYBODY WHO'S EVER GOTTEN THEIR BOOT HALF STUCK IN THE MUD, THEY KNOW THAT IT'S REALLY HARD TO PULL THAT OUT. I'M BASICALLY DOING THAT WITH THE MOORING. I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE WE CAN DO, WHAT WE CAN MAKE IT BETTER. IF SOMEBODY COULD DIVE DOWN THERE AND BRUSH THAT MUD OFF, THAT WOULD HELP. I'M NOT DOING THAT. I'M NOT DOING THAT. I LOVE HAVING STEPH WITH ME. I DON'T THINK I'D BE ABLE TO LIVE ON THE HOUSEBOAT IF I WAS JUST ON MY OWN. THAT IS WHY IT'S GOOD TO HAVE A TEAM. YOU LEARN TO WORK WITH ONE ANOTHER. CAN YOU SEE ANYTHING DOWN THERE? THERE'S THE BUBBLES. THERE'S THE BUBBLES. YEP. THAT MEANS THE MOORING'S COMING OUT OF THE MUD. GOOD. IT'S RELEASING BUBBLES OF AIR. THE MOORING IS OFF THE BOTTOM NOW. OKAY. AND THEN WE'RE GONNA USE THE MOTORBOAT TO SLOWLY AND GENTLY MOVE IT OUT. AND THEN RELEASE IT AND DROP IT DOWN. OKAY. I REALLY HOPE THIS WORKS. I GOT MY FINGERS CROSSED. HERE WE GO. WE'RE MOVING, BABY! IT'S WORKING. YEAH! I'M GONNA GO DEEPER SO WE DON'T HIT MUD. YEP. GOOD IDEA. ALL RIGHT, THIS IS EXACTLY WHERE I WANT TO GO, JUST LIKE THAT. HOUSEBOATING DOESN'T COME WITH A MANUAL. YOU GOT TO FIGURE **** OUT. YOU GOT TO BE INGENUITIVE, YOU'VE GOT TO BE RESOURCEFUL, AND YOU GOT TO BE READY TO TAKE SOME GAMBLES, TAKE SOME RISKS. AND, SOMETIMES, IT JUST PAYS OFF. AND DROP. THAT'S IT. PUSH IT THROUGH. THERE YOU GO. BEAUTIFUL. SHE'S ON THE GROUND? SHE'S ON THE GROUND. THAT'S IT? YEAH. NOW ALL FOUR OF THE KIMBERLITE'S LINES AND ANCHORS ARE SECURE ENOUGH TO PROTECT THEM FROM MOVING IN THE SUMMER WINDS AND FALL STORMS. SO, NOW THE ICE AND THE WIND COMES IN, WE'RE SAFE ON THIS SIDE. WE'RE NOT MOVING? ABSOLUTELY NOT. WE'RE GONNA BE SAFE. KNOCK ON WOOD? ALLYCE IS MY BUDDY, MAN. SHE'S MY LIFE-MATE. SO TO DO SOMETHING THAT IS SO IMPORTANT FOR BOTH OF US, 'CAUSE IT IS OUR HOUSE, IT WAS A REAL SENSE OF ACCOMPLISHMENT. THANK YOU. I LOVE YOU. STEPH AND I ARE CELEBRATING TONIGHT. THAT'S FOR SURE. SUCCESS. COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT WITHOUT YOU. TRY AND GO THIS WAY. I'M TRYING, BUD. YOU'RE ALL IN CONTROL, MIKE. I'VE SET SAIL. RUNNING OVER TOP OF THE ICE IS KIND OF HARD ON THE BOAT. MY STEERING JUST STRIPPED. IN YELLOWKNIFE BAY, SPRINGTIME AWAKENS THE LAKE, MELTING THE ICE AND BRINGING FRESH HOPE AND CHALLENGES FOR THE HOUSEBOATERS. IN ORDER TO KEEP THE FAMILY BARGES AND THEIR CAFé UP AND RUNNING WHILE HER FATHER IS AWAY, MOLLY TACKLES A LONG LIST OF DAILY CHORES ALONE. EVER SINCE I WAS A LITTLE GIRL, MY DAD'S TAUGHT ME HOW TO SURVIVE IN THE NORTH. I JUST HOPE I CAN MAKE HIM PROUD. THE FIRST ITEM OF THE DAY IS REPLENISHING PROPANE. SO, I RAN OUT OF PROPANE ON THE MOLLY BARGE, SO I'M GONNA THROW THIS OFF THE SIDE AND TAKE IT OVER TO THE MOLLY BARGE AND CHANGE THE PROPANE. BECAUSE WE'RE OFF GRID, WE USE PROPANE FOR ALL OF OUR STOVES AND TO HEAT THE HOUSE AND FOR MY CAFé. WE HAVE TO BRING THE PROPANE TO THE DOCK AND HAVE ENOUGH PROPANE, YOU KNOW, TO HEAT IT AND MAKE SURE THAT THE STOVES RUN. IT IS A LITTLE BIT NERVE-RACKING TO THROW PROPANE OFF THE SIDE OF A HOUSEBOAT WHEN THERE'S ROCKS UNDERNEATH. YOU JUST KIND OF GO AGAINST ALL YOUR INSTINCTS AND CHUCK IT OFF THE SIDE. I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN PHYSICALLY LIFT THIS THING, SO THAT'S GONNA BE A BIT OF A SURPRISE. FULL PROPANE TANKS WEIGH NEARLY 100 POUNDS AND ARE DANGEROUS TO WRESTLE INTO A CANOE. THEIR BUOYANCY MAKES IT POSSIBLE FOR MOLLY TO FLOAT THE LARGE TANK BACK TO THE MOLLY BARGE. IT WAS A LITTLE AWKWARD. CANOEING HAS A LOT TO DO WITH, LIKE, BALANCE AND WHERE YOUR CENTER OF GRAVITY IS. SO IT REALLY THROWS YOU OFF. IT TOOK ABOUT TWICE AS LONG TO CANOE IT OVER. SO, WHAT I'M GONNA DO IS I'M GONNA TAKE THIS PULLEY AND I'M GONNA HOOK IT UP TO THE PROPANE TANK TO GET IT OUT OF THE WATER, BECAUSE IT'S TOO HEAVY FOR ME TO LIFT. THIS IS REALLY HEAVY. THAT'S NOT IDEAL. I HAD TO PUT MY WHOLE BODY WEIGHT INTO IT. YEAH, I COULD HARDLY LIFT IT UP. YES, I DID IT! WHEN I GOT IT ON THE DOCK, I WAS LIKE, "YEAH, YEAH!" I CAN'T SAY THAT WASN'T HEAVY. I DON'T REALLY MIND NOT HAVING RUNNING WATER OR A SHOWER FOR LIKE A WEEK OR, LIKE, TECHNOLOGY. PEOPLE ARE LIKE, "WHAT ABOUT YOUR HAIR DRYER OR YOUR..." WHATEVER IS IMPORTANT TO THEM. BUT I REALLY DON'T MISS IT. I MEAN, IT'S JUST WORTH IT TO LIVE ON THE LAKE. IT'S GOT SOMETHING THAT NO OTHER PLACE IN THE WORLD HAS, AND THAT'S JUST, YOU KNOW, A REALLY SPECIAL CULTURE. IT'S REALLY HEAVY. I'M GLAD I DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT AGAIN FOR A WHILE. ON YELLOWKNIFE BAY, ONCE THE LAKE THAWS, THE FREE REBEL LIFE OF A HOUSEBOATER MEANS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF MOBILITY. AND, TODAY, PIKE MIKE IS READY TO SET SAIL. THERE'S A NUMBER OF REASONS TO DO THIS MOVE. IT'S JUST TOO CONGESTED HERE IN THE CHANNEL. YOU CAN SEE THE THREE BOATS DOWN THERE STACKED UP AGAINST EACH OTHER. WE GET A BIG WIND FROM THE SOUTH. WE ALL GET PRESSED IN. GET OUT THERE ON THE OUTSKIRTS, I'LL BE ALL BY MY LONESOME. MOVING THREE BOATS MILES ACROSS THE BAY IS A TWO-PERSON JOB, AND MIKE REACHES OUT TO FRIEND AND FELLOW HOUSEBOATER STEPHAN FOR HELP. WE'RE COMMUNITY MEN. WE'RE NEIGHBORS. WE ALWAYS AIM TO HELP. IF WE GOT THE TIME, WE'LL DO IT. IF WE AIN'T GOT THE TIME, WE'LL TRY TO MAKE THE TIME. - HEY, MAN! - NICE LAUNCH. YEAH, THANK YOU. MIKE HAS DECIDED TO MOVE. PIKE LIKES HIS OWN PEACE AND QUIET. HE'S CALLED UPON ME BECAUSE HE DOESN'T HAVE A POWERBOAT, AND I JUST GOT ONE LAST FALL. THIS IS A COMMUNITY OF GREAT PEOPLE. WE ALWAYS AIM TO HELP EVERY SINGLE TIME. HERE'S HOW WE HAVE TO APPROACH IT. YOU'RE GONNA PUSH ME. PUSH. KEEP YOUR BOW ON THE END OF THE DECK THERE. WE'RE GONNA ROTATE THE FIN 90 DEGREES. TIE HER OFF, SECURE HER, TIE THE CANOE TO IT. YOU BACK US OUT. OKAY. AND THEN DART ACROSS. THEN DART ACROSS. NOT ONLY AM I MOVING HIS HOUSEBOAT, I'M MOVING HIS BIG-ASS MOTORBOAT, AND I'M ALSO MOVING HIS CANOE. SO NOW WE'RE TYING THREE VESSELS TOGETHER. AND I'M THINKING THESE ARE ALL GONNA ACT LIKE SAILS IN THE WIND. THIS IS NOT GONNA BE EASY. OKAY, WE'RE GONNA TRY AND GET OUT... THAT'S OKAY. I'M GONNA BE ABLE TO PUSH IT AWAY. TRY AND GO THIS WAY. I'M TRYING, BUD. I THINK THIS IS THE WAY. OKAY. HOLD ON. I MEAN, I'VE GOT NO CONTROL HERE. I'M LISTENING TO EVERYTHING HE'S TELLING ME, AND IT AIN'T WORKING. I'LL TELL YOU... THIS IS THE MOST REVERSE ACTION I'VE EVER DONE WITH THIS MOTOR. WHOO! IT'S DEEP AND COLD THERE, MIKE. THAT'S WHEN I DECIDED I'D HAD ENOUGH OF THIS PLAYING AROUND. IT WAS TIME TO GET ON SOME HIP WADERS, GET IN THE WATER, AND MANHANDLE THAT VESSEL UNTIL WE WERE CLEAR. DO YOU WANT ME TO BE ON THE MOTOR? YOU GET ON THE MOTOR, 'CAUSE I'M SHOVING THIS **** OUT. OKAY. IT'S WHAT I WANTED ALL ALONG. IT'S WHAT I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE DONE FROM THE START. ARE YOU CLEAR? WHOA, BOY! WHOO! CLEAR THERE? WE'RE CLEAR STRAIGHT OUT. ONCE WE GOT CLEAR, I FELT A LOT MORE COMFORTABLE. ALL RIGHT, I'M COMING BACK AROUND YOU SOMEHOW HERE. YOU KNOW, I FEEL LIKE WILLIAM KIDD OR SAMUEL CHAMPLAIN. I'VE SET SAIL. YOU'RE ALL IN CONTROL, MIKE. IT'S ALL YOURS. TAKE IT STRAIGHT OUT. WE'RE IN A GOOD DRIFT RIGHT HERE. WE GOT THE SUN UP IN THE SKY, IT'S BEAUTIFUL, AND THE WIND IS DOWN. SEE THE COVE? IT GOES RIGHT UP INTO THE SKID SHOT. WHAT THIS PROVIDES FOR ME IS THE SENSE OF ADVENTURE THAT I'M CONSTANTLY PURSUING. NOW, IF THIS ISN'T HUCK FINN-ING AND TOM SAWYER-ING, I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS. ON THE OPEN LAKE, FISHERMAN BRIAN ABBOTT RISKED LIFE AND LIMB THIS WINTER SETTING NETS IN MINUS-40 DEGREES DURING BLIZZARDS, DRILLING THROUGH 6 FEET OF SOLID ICE. NOW HE RETURNS TO THE EASE OF OPEN-WATER FISHING FOR THE FIRST TIME THIS SEASON. HE'S HOPING THE ICE HAS MELTED ENOUGH FOR SAFE PASSAGE. WELL, MY NORMAL ROUTE IS DEAD AHEAD, BUT IT'S SOLID ICE. AND THE WIND'S BLOWING IT STRAIGHT THIS WAY. WELL, I SPENT A LOT OF TIME ON THE ICE THIS WINTER, AND IT WAS DARN COLD THIS YEAR. IT'S SO NICE TO BE OUT IN THE WARMTH AND THE SUNSHINE. I LOVE THE FIRST TRIP OF THE YEAR. IT'S USUALLY BEAUTIFUL, LIKE THIS. NOT VERY MUCH WIND IN THE SPRING, AND YOU'VE GOT THE MAIN SHEET OF ICE THERE TO KEEP ANY WAVES DOWN. SO THIS IS THE PRIMO SEASON TO BE FISHING. I'M HOPING I CAN PICK MY WAY THROUGH THE ICE SO THAT I CAN GET TO WHERE I WANT TO SET MY NETS. OWING TO ITS MASSIVE SIZE, DEPTH, AND LOCATION... JUST 200 MILES FROM THE ARCTIC CIRCLE... GREAT SLAVE LAKE IS HOME TO CONSTANTLY SHIFTING ICE FLOES SEVERAL FEET THICK AND WEIGHING AS MUCH AS A TON DEEP INTO THE SUMMER MONTHS. RUNNING OVER TOP OF THE ICE IS KIND OF HARD ON THE BOAT ITSELF, BEING FIBERGLASS. ICE IS ACTUALLY QUITE ABRASIVE. SO IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL, AS WELL, IT'LL JUST CHEW THE HELL OUT OF YOUR PROP. HALFWAY THERE. MY STEERING JUST STRIPPED. THAT MEANS I HAVE NO STEERING ANYMORE. 15 MILES AWAY FROM HOME, BRIAN'S NOW CAUGHT IN AN ICE FLOE WITH NO WAY TO NAVIGATE. HOLY **** IN YELLOWKNIFE BAY, SPRING IS IN FULL BLOOM, FREEING THE HOUSEBOATERS FROM WINTER'S FROZEN GRIP. BUT OUT ON THE OPEN LAKE, ROVING ICE FLOES STILL POSE A THREAT. FISHERMAN BRIAN ABBOTT IS NOW STRANDED MILES FROM HOME AND IN THE MIDST OF AN ICE FLOE WHICH TOOK OUT HIS BOAT'S STEERING. LITERALLY HAVE NO STEERING. GOES ONE WAY BUT NOT THE OTHER. WELL, THAT'S NOT GOOD. SO, I GUESS IF I COULD PULL IT OVER BY HAND, I CAN STEER IT THAT WAY. WELL, THIS IS JUST A LOUSY START TO THE SEASON HERE. MY STEERING JUST STRIPPED OUT. NOT AN AWFUL LOT TO TIE ON THROUGH HERE. BRIAN TIES A ROPE TO THE ENGINE IN HOPES OF STEERING THE BOAT MANUALLY. THERE WE GO. HOLY COW. IT'S NOT MOVING. THIS AIN'T GONNA TURN AS EASY AS I HAD HOPED. SO I THINK I'LL UNDO THE STEERING AND TRY IT WITHOUT THE STEERING HOOKED IN IT FOR A MOMENT. NOW SEE IF IT MOVES. IT'S STILL NOT MOVING. MAYBE THAT'S WHY IT STRIPPED... IT SEIZED OR SOMETHING. HOLY COW. THERE WE GO. DOESN'T GRAB THE ONE WAY AT ALL RIGHT NOW. IT'S NOT EVEN GRABBING AT ALL, EVEN EITHER WAY NOW. SO IT'LL BE STEERING IT MANUALLY AND GOING SLOW. I'M GONNA HAVE TO WORK WITH WHAT I GOT HERE. I'M SURE I CAN MICKEY MOUSE THIS SOMEHOW OR OTHER. IT'S JUST A METHOD OF FIX A PROBLEM, AND LIFE IS NOTHING BUT A PROBLEM-SOLVING EXERCISE, REALLY. YOU'RE DEALING WITH DIESELS AND MACHINES AND PNEUMATIC SYSTEMS AND ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS. THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING GOING WRONG. FOR NOW, BRIAN WILL HAVE TO PADDLE BACK TO THE FISH PLANT. UNTIL HIS STEERING CAN BE FIXED, BRIAN IS OFF THE WATER AND AWAY FROM CATCHING FISH DURING THE PEAK WEEKS OF THE SPRING SEASON. IT'S BAD TO BE SHUT DOWN THIS TIME OF YEAR, BECAUSE WHEN YOU FIRST START FISHING, THE FISH ARE VERY THICK. THE NETS WOULD BE FILLED RIGHT NOW. AND THAT'S THE TIME YOU MAKE HAY. IT'S A BIT OF A HARD, TREACHEROUS LIFE OUT HERE. BUT IT'S WELL WORTH IT. IT'S KIND OF HARD NOT BEING OUT FISHING RIGHT NOW. IT'S JUST SUCH A LOVELY PLACE OUT THERE. IT'S SO PEACEFUL. ON THE EDGE OF YELLOWKNIFE BAY... DON'T LET THE DRIFT KEEP BLOWING US THIS WAY. ...PIKE MIKE AND STEPHAN MOVE HIS HOME SEVERAL MILES SOUTH TO A SECLUDED COVE, WHERE THE MOUTH OF THE BAY MEETS THE WILD OPEN WATERS OF GREAT SLAVE LAKE. DO YOU WANT ME TO TAKE THE BOAT? YES. I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU WANT TO LAND, MIKE. I REALLY DON'T KNOW... MIND THE LINES. YOUR CANOE HIT GROUND, MIKE? OKAY. HE MOVED THE SMALLEST HOUSEBOAT IN THE BAY TO THE EDGE OF THE REAL BIG WATER. THAT TAKES SOME BALLS. I DIDN'T REALIZE THIS IS WHERE YOU WANTED TO BE. I THINK I PICKED A GOOD SPOT. HOW MANY HOUSEBOATS DO YOU SEE IN THIS LOCATION? THIS WATER'S A LOT MORE ACTIVE THAN WE ARE IN THE BAY. FOR ME, I WOULDN'T MAKE THAT MOVE. THE DISTANCE ALONE... THE DISTANCE THAT HE'S ADDED TO HIS TRIP BACK TO THE BAY ADDS TO HIS RISK TO HIS EXPOSURE TIME OF BEING IN THE CRAZY WAVES. AND, FOR ME NO MERCI. YOU ALWAYS NEED SOMEBODY TO HELP YOU MOVE YOUR HOUSEBOAT. THAT'S A HUGE FAVOR, AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT, STEPH. LIFE RIGHT HERE AT THIS LITTLE COVE? THAT'S FREE-AND-EASY LIVING. IT'S A BIT OF A GAMBLE, BUT I DON'T MIND LIVING DANGEROUSLY. I'M GLAD I COULD BE YOUR GUY AND I'M GLAD WE GOT HERE SAFELY, MAN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH. WELL, I GOT TO HEAD OUT FOR NOW. OKAY. ENJOY YOUR NEW LOCATION. ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BAY, MOLLY MacKINNON IS NOW HOME ALONE, IN CHARGE OF THREE VESSELS... THE MOLLY, CT, AND AURORA BARGES... MAKING SURE THEIR OFF-THE-GRID SYSTEMS ARE RUNNING AND THE BOATS REMAIN SEAWORTHY. IT'S DEFINITELY PRETTY DIFFERENT NOT HAVING MY DAD HERE AND IT'S SCARY, 'CAUSE IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG, IT'S MY PROBLEM TO FIX IT. MOLLY HAS TO CHECK THE BARGE'S BALLASTS TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE FREE OF WATER. IF THERE IS TOO MUCH, THE BOAT WILL BE IN DANGER OF SINKING. WE HAVE TO CHECK THESE ALL THE TIME TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE NOT FILLING UP. THESE ARE ALL INDIVIDUAL COMPARTMENTS. SO, MY METHOD OF TESTING HOW MUCH WATER IS IN THE COMPARTMENTS IS I HAVE A STICK WITH A LINE ON IT WHERE THE IDEAL RANGE IS. AND IF IT'S, OBVIOUSLY, MORE, THEN WE HAVE A PROBLEM. LESS, WE'RE OKAY. THIS LOOKS PRETTY GOOD. WE'RE NOT ANYWHERE CLOSE TO THIS LINE, SO WE KNOW THAT THIS COMPARTMENT'S OKAY. THERE'S A FAIR AMOUNT OF WATER, THOUGH. IF YOUR HOUSE HAD THAT MUCH WATER IN THE BOTTOM OF IT, YOU PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE FEELING GOOD ABOUT IT. BUT THAT'S NORMAL. IT'S AN OLD BARGE. THE CT BARGE IS OVER 20 YEARS OLD, AND TWO DECADES OF RUST ALLOWS MORE WATER INTO ITS BILGE. THIS IS REALLY BAD. THAT MEANS THIS BARGE HAS A TON OF WATER ON THIS SIDE. AND THERE'S A BIT OF A LEAN. YOU CAN SEE IT RIGHT NOW. SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GET A SUMP PUMP AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO PUMP THAT OUT RIGHT NOW BEFORE ANYTHING WORSE HAPPENS. IF WE DON'T DEAL WITH THIS, THE HOUSE MIGHT SINK, AND MY DAD WILL PROBABLY KILL ME. SPRING USHERS IN A SENSE OF RENEWAL ON THIS MASSIVE SUBARCTIC LAKE AND FOR THE REBELS THAT CALL IT HOME. IN YELLOWKNIFE BAY, MOLLY MacKINNON HAS GROWN INTO A CERTIFIED HOUSEBOATER... RISING UP TO MEET THE CHALLENGE OF KEEPING HER FATHER'S BARGES OPERATING AND AFLOAT WHILE HE'S AWAY ON BUSINESS. BUT AS MOLLY CHECKS HER FLOTATION TANKS, SHE DISCOVERS A SERIOUS PROBLEM. THIS IS REALLY BAD. I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH WATER THE HOUSE COULD TAKE ON, BUT I'M CONFIDENT I DON'T WANT TO PUSH THE LIMITS ON THAT. SO, RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE TO GET A SUMP PUMP OUT OF THE HOUSE AND WE'RE GONNA TAKE IT AND WE'RE GONNA PUMP THE WATER OUT UNTIL IT'S AT A PRETTY NORMAL LEVEL, THE SAME LEVEL AS THE OTHER ONES OR LESS. WELL, WE'RE USED TO OUR BASEMENT FLOODING. WE DON'T HAVE ANY, LIKE, PERSONAL ITEMS DOWN THERE, BUT OUR HOUSE WILL SINK, AND MY DAD WILL PROBABLY KILL ME. PEOPLE USUALLY USE THESE IN THEIR BACKYARDS IF IT'S, LIKE, PRONE TO FLOODING. FOR US, TODAY, THIS IS GOING TO SAVE OUR HOUSE. I SUPPOSE MOST PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS STUFF ON A DAILY BASIS, BUT THIS IS JUST WHAT IT'S LIKE TO LIVE ON A HOUSEBOAT. ALL OF THIS WATER IS ACTUALLY COMING OUT OF OUR HOUSE. WELL, THAT'S HOW MUCH WAS IN THERE BEFORE. LET'S HOPE THERE'S LESS NOW. MUCH BETTER. IT'S UNDER CONTROL. THAT'S LIKE ALL THE OTHER ONES NOW, INSTEAD OF LIKE THAT. THAT WAS SCARY. NOW IT'S JUST THE PROBLEM OF GETTING THE SUMP PUMP OUT OF THERE, WHICH IS BETTER THAN HAVING THE HOUSE SINK. SO IT'S OKAY. COMING FROM THE VANCOUVER AREA, THIS IS A BIG CHANGE. HERE ON THE LAKE, YOU'VE GOT TO BE REALLY AWARE OF EVERYTHING GOING ON AROUND YOU OR, LIKE, YOU WILL DIE. THIS IS NOT SOMETHING I EVER HAVE TO DEAL WITH IN VANCOUVER. NEAR THE HIGHEST POINT ON JOLLIFFE ISLAND, STEPHAN HERVIEUX HAS TOILED THROUGH THE DARK DAYS OF WINTER, WORKING ODD JOBS AND EARNING WHATEVER HE CAN TO PAY FOR HIS WEDDING. NOW, WITH SPRING IN THE AIR, STEPHAN'S HOPING HIS HARD WORK PAYS OFF. BUT THERE'S STILL A LOT TO DO BEFORE HE TIES THE KNOT. HERE IT IS 24 HOURS AND COUNTING BEFORE I'M SUPPOSED TO BE MARRIED, AND I'VE GOT TO BUILD AN ALTAR. I'VE GOT TO BUILD TABLES. I GOT TO BUILD A FIRE PIT. AND I'VE GOT LIKE NO TIME LEFT. SO, I'M GONNA NEED FOUR POSTS LIKE THIS. OKAY, SO, THIS IS NUMBER ONE. I USUALLY DO EVERYTHING WITH ALLYCE. SO, THESE TWO UP LIKE THAT, AND THEN TWO OTHERS BACK HERE. WE'RE A TEAM. BUT I'M TRYING TO SURPRISE HER HERE. I DON'T WANT HER TO SEE ANY OF THIS. COME ON. THIS 24 HOURS BEFORE I'M GETTING MARRIED. WHAT A STUPID MOVE. LUCKILY, STEPHAN HAS CALLED IN REINFORCEMENTS... HEY, BUD. DUDE. HEY, MAN. HOW ARE YOU? SORRY I'M LATE, MAN. **** NO WORRIES, MAN. JUST THANK YOU FOR SHOWING UP, DUDE. WHAT DO YOU GOT GOING ON? WELL... ...HIS BEST MAN, RYAN DEMPSTER. PERFECT TIMING, ACTUALLY. I GOT MOST OF IT DONE, BUT I'M OUT OF ROPE, SO TELL ME YOU BROUGHT ROPE. I BROUGHT ROPE. YES! ONE, TWO, THREE. I FOUND A GREAT LOCATION FOR THE WEDDING. IT'S ON THE HIGHEST POINT ON JOLLIFFE ISLAND, OVERLOOKING YELLOWKNIFE BAY AND THE HOUSEBOATS. THIS IS GONNA GO, LIKE, FROM HERE TO THERE. THIS IS A PRIME LOCATION SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU'RE OVERLOOKING OUR COMMUNITY. OKAY, HOLD THAT THOUGHT. I CAN'T SPEND MONEY ON A CATERER. I CAN'T SPEND MONEY ON TABLES. I CAN'T SPEND MONEY ON A HALL. SO I'VE GOT TO MAKE SOMETHING OUT OF NOTHING. CHECK IT OUT. THAT IS AWESOME, RYAN. SOME PEOPLE SPEND $10,000 TO $20,000 ON A WEDDING. THAT'S INSANE. TAKE ONE OFF, TAKE THE ONES FROM THE BOTTOM, PUT IT ON, PUT IT ON, STACK THEM AS WE CAN. JUST FILL IT. SO IT'S FULL TABLE. OKAY. AND THEN I'LL PUT A NICE CLOTH ON IT, AND NO ONE WILL KNOW THE DIFFERENCE. EXCELLENT. RIGHT? ONE, TWO, THREE. YEAH, BABY! I WANT TO IMPRESS ALLYCE. I WANT TO BE HER HERO. KNOW WHAT THE COOLEST PART OF THIS IS? AFTER WE'RE DONE EATING ON THESE TABLES... GET TO BURN THEM. YEAH! DUAL-PURPOSE TABLES. SO I'VE GOT TO MAKE THE BEST WEDDING I CAN WITH THE RESOURCES I'VE GOT. ONE DOWN. YEAH. FOUR MORE TO GO. LET'S GRAB ANOTHER ONE. LET'S GO. ON THE NORTHERN SHORES OF THE LAKE, RAGNAR WESSTROM SCRAMBLED TO PROTECT HIS TROUT ROCK LODGE FROM WILD ANIMALS AND SEVERE COLD ALL WINTER LONG. NOW, WITH SPRING'S ARRIVAL, HE'S HOPING TO GET HIS LODGE OPEN FOR HIS FIRST GUESTS OF THE NEW HUNTING SEASON. HOW'S YOUR ENGINE RUNNING? AMAZING. WELL, IN THE BEGINNING, WHEN WE STARTED, I DID EVERYTHING. BUT NOW, I HAVE THE MANAGER. HE'S IN CHARGE OF THE GUIDES. SO, I JUST PRETTY MUCH OVERLOOK EVERYTHING, MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS HAPPENING. AND I STILL DO LOTS OF PUT-PUT DURING THE DAY. AND THE PROP BLADES? YEAH, WE CHANGED ONE PROP, BUT THE OTHERS ARE ALL IN PRETTY GOOD SHAPE. I THINK THEY WERE DONE ALREADY. TOOL KITS? WORKING ON THEM. FIRST AID? WORKING ON IT. SO, WE START OUR SEASON TOMORROW, AND WE'RE FULLY BOOKED UNTIL END OF JULY. SO WE'RE GOING TWO MONTHS STEADY. OKAY. THE BOAT LOOKS GOOD. YOU GOT TO KEEP THEM CLEANED. EVERY NIGHT WHEN YOU COME BACK, GAS UP THE BOATS AND CLEAN THEM. OKAY, GUYS? WE'LL SEE YOU AT DINNER. WE GOT LIKE SEVEN MONTHS OF WINTER HERE, AND IT'S DARK, IT IS COLD, AND IT'S TERRIBLE ON EQUIPMENT, ON PEOPLE, ON EVERYTHING. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? IN APRIL, MAY, IT TURNS AROUND. AND THE SPRING IS COMING, AND THEN JUNE, SUMMER IS HERE. MAKES IT ALL WORTHWHILE. IT'S ALSO A PARADISE. WHEN EVERYTHING GOES WELL, YOU CAN ENJOY IT... THE PRISTINE WILDERNESS AND THE FREEDOM. YOU ARE FEELING LIKE YOU'RE ON TOP OF THE WORLD. YOU ARE THE KING IN YOUR KINGDOM. GOT TO GET THE FLAG UP. VERY IMPORTANT. THE REASON I LIKE IT UP HERE IS THE FREEDOM, THE BEAUTY OF THE LAND, THE FISHING, THE HUNTING, AND YOU'RE IN FULL CONTROL OF YOURSELF. YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE ANY ORDERS, GO BY ANY OTHER PEOPLE'S RULES. I'M A VIKING. I LIKE TO HAVE MY OWN STILL, DO MY OWN THING. I LOVE IT UP HERE. OKAY. NICE. BEAUTIFUL. THAT'S BETTER. ...CLOSET, SO STEPH'S NOT ALLOWED IN HERE. HE HASN'T SEEN THE DRESS YET. STEPH CALLS ME HIS ICE PRINCESS. THERE WERE SO MANY THINGS I HAD TO DO, AND THERE WAS NO TIME TO DO IT IN. I'M, LIKE, GRASPING AT STRAWS, JUST TRYING TO GET EVERYTHING DONE. I'M FREAKING OUT. AS THE JUNE SUN DANCES ACROSS THE WATER, THE REBELS BEGIN A NEW CHAPTER ON GREAT SLAVE LAKE. ABOARD THE KIMBERLITE, ALLYCE RATTRAY HAS SURVIVED THE BRUTAL WINTER MONTHS LIVING ON A FROZEN LAKE WITH THE PROMISE OF STARTING A LIFE TOGETHER WITH HER FIANCé, STEPHAN, IN THE SPRING. NOW THAT PROMISED DAY IS FINALLY HERE. AND ALLYCE IS MORE THAN READY. IT'S A LITTLE TIGHT HERE. THIS IS THE ONLY FULL-LENGTH CLOSET, SO STEPH'S NOT ALLOWED IN HERE. HE HASN'T SEEN THE DRESS YET. BUT THERE SHE IS. MY NICE WEDDING DRESS. THAT'S BETTER. DO YOU HAVE MAKEUP? YEP. STEPH CALLS ME HIS ICE PRINCESS. IT'S A CUTE NICKNAME. BUT I'M PRETTY TOUGH. STILL, I WANT A BEAUTIFUL WEDDING. I STILL NEED THAT. SO WE'VE GOT A LOT OF WORK AHEAD OF US. ARE THEY WITH LYNN AND THEM? WELL, THEY WERE HOPING TO MEET UP WITH THEM. THEY HAVE SOME WOOD TO CUT AND THEN THEY'RE HEADING OUT. THIS YEAR HAS BEEN A REALLY COLD WINTER, AND THE MINUS-50s REALLY HURT THE HOUSE. EVERYTHING THAT COULD BREAK BROKE DOWN. BUT NOW THE WEATHER'S GETTING BETTER. EVERYTHING'S COMING ALONG JUST ON TRACK. SO WE'RE ACTUALLY, SOMEHOW, GONNA MAKE IT ALL COME TOGETHER IN TIME. SHE'S TALL. IT'S CUTE? YEAH. I LIKE IT. SO, WE EXPECT SOME CLOSE YELLOWKNIFE FRIENDS. WE'RE GONNA HAVE SOME OTHER HOUSEBOATERS THERE. IT'S GONNA BE AN INTIMATE AFFAIR. STEPH'S ALL READY. WE JUST HAVE TO DO LAST-MINUTE DETAILS AND THEN WE'RE GOOD TO GO. THE BIG DAY HAS ARRIVED. STEPHAN AND ALLYCE ARE FINALLY GOING TO TIE THE KNOT, NORTHERN STYLE. AS GUESTS ARRIVE TO THE WEDDING, OUT ON THE BAY, RANDY SIBBESTON EMERGED FROM WINTER WITH NEW FLOATS TO REPLACE HIS LEAKING HOUSEBOAT. BUT ICE ON THE OPEN LAKE HAS HALTED HIS PLANS FOR A FEW MORE WEEKS. SO, TODAY, HE'S TAKING TIME TO CELEBRATE HIS FRIEND'S MARRIAGE. I KNOW THAT ALLYCE AND STEPHAN HAVE A VERY STRONG RELATIONSHIP. THEY'RE A VERY TIGHT COUPLE. AND, YEAH, IT'S A REALLY TOUGH ENVIRONMENT UP HERE IN THE NORTH, AND HAVING A GOOD PARTNER IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH SOMETIMES, YOU KNOW, AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PAIN AND PLEASURE AND MISERY AND HAPPINESS. JUST THE DAY IS SO PERFECT, AND ALLYCE AND STEPHAN ARE SO BEAUTIFUL TOGETHER. THERE WERE SO MANY THINGS I HAD TO DO, AND THERE WAS NO TIME TO DO IT IN. SO, OF COURSE, I'M FREAKING OUT. I'M, LIKE, GRASPING AT STRAWS, JUST TRYING TO GET EVERYTHING DONE. AND, BELIEVE IT OR NOT, I MADE IT HAPPEN. THE EVENT BRINGS THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY TOGETHER, INCLUDING FORMER HOUSEBOATER IMAN KASSAM, WHO RETURNS TO OFFICIATE THE CEREMONY. SOME OF THE COOLEST THINGS THAT I'VE BEEN THROUGH IN YELLOWKNIFE HAVE HAPPENED WITH MY HOUSEBOATER FRIENDS. I THINK IT'LL BE AWESOME AND SWEET AND ROMANTIC AND IT'LL BE FUN. ALLYCE AND I CHOSE IMAN BECAUSE WE KNEW SHE'D DO A WONDERFUL JOB. WE'RE ALL JUST NUMBERS, AREN'T WE? AND I KNEW THAT IMAN, AS A PRIESTESS, WOULD DELIVER THE MOST LOVELY CEREMONY EVER. I WAS SO NERVOUS. I MEAN, I'M TRYING TO REMEMBER MY VOWS. I'M LOOKING AT EVERYBODY THAT'S THERE. I'M WORRYING ABOUT THEM. IS EVERYBODY GONNA LIKE THE ALTAR? THE SETTING... IT'S WINDY. I'M FREAKING OUT. GOOD GIRL. COME ON. AND THEN ALLYCE COMES WALKING THROUGH. SHE IS GORGEOUS. FRIENDS, WE'RE GATHERED HERE TODAY TO CELEBRATE LOVE. WE'RE HERE TO RECOGNIZE THE WORTH AND THE BEAUTY OF COMMITMENT AND TO CHERISH THE WORDS WHICH SHALL UNITE STEPHAN GEORGIE EARL HERVIEUX AND HEATHER ALLYCE RATTRAY IN MARRIAGE. AS THE GOLDEN RAYS OF SPRING SHINE DOWN ON GREAT SLAVE LAKE, THE BATTLE SCARS OF THE HARSH SUBARCTIC WINTER ARE A DISTANT MEMORY FOR THE HOUSEBOATERS OF YELLOWKNIFE BAY. FOR SEVEN MONTHS, THE LAKE'S SAVAGE ICE, SNOW, AND WINDS EXACTED A HEAVY PRICE FOR THE FREEDOM THEY CHERISH BEING LAKE DWELLERS. BUT, TODAY, A NEW SEASON BRINGS RELIEF AND REBIRTH WITH THE MARRIAGE OF STEPHAN AND ALLYCE. WE'RE HERE TO RECOGNIZE THE WORTH AND THE BEAUTY OF COMMITMENT AND TO CHERISH THE WORDS WHICH SHALL UNITE STEPHAN GEORGIE EARL HERVIEUX AND HEATHER ALLYCE RATTRAY IN MARRIAGE. PLEASE JOIN HANDS. ALLYCE, YOU KNOW I HAVE NEVER MET ANYONE LIKE YOU. YOU ONLY EXISTED IN MY MIND UNTIL I MET YOU. AND TO SEE YOU MATERIALIZE AND TO KNOW SOMETHING I DID NOT KNOW, DEEPER THAN MY IMAGINATION COULD GO, AND I WANT TO WALK THROUGH LIFE WITH YOU... THIS ONE AND THE NEXT ONE... BECAUSE YOU'RE MY GIRL. STEPH, I AM SO THRILLED TO BE STANDING HERE LOOKING IN YOUR EYES TODAY WITH EVERYONE AROUND US, 'CAUSE YOU'RE AMAZING. YOU'RE EVERYTHING TO ME. YOU'RE MY COURAGE, MY STRENGTH, EVERYTHING. YOU'RE GONNA MAKE ME CRY. I'M ALREADY CRYING, SO MIGHT AS WELL JOIN IN. YOU'RE EVERYTHING. YOU'RE MY POLAR OPPOSITE, BUT YOU SOMEHOW FULFILL ME. AND I'M SO HAPPY. WE HAVE THE MOST AMAZING LIFE AND THE MOST AMAZING FAMILY. AND I'M SO HAPPY TO BE ABLE TO CALL YOU MY HUSBAND TODAY. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO EVERY DAY THAT WE GROW STRONGER AND WE GROW BIGGER AS A FAMILY AND WE JUST... I'M JUST SO EXCITED FOR IT ALL. I LOVE YOU, BABE. I LOVE YOU. NOT YET. JUMPING THE GUN. IT'S A CHEER, OKAY? I'M JUST CHECKING THE CAR OUT BEFORE I BUY IT. REPEAT AFTER ME. I STEPHAN GEORGIE EARL HERVIEUX, TAKE YOU, HEATHER ALLYCE RATTRAY, TO BE MY WIFE. I STEPHAN GEORGIE EARL HERVIEUX, TAKE YOU, HEATHER ALLYCE RATTRAY, TO BE MY WIFE. I, ALLYCE RATTRAY, TAKE YOU, STEPHAN HERVIEUX, TO BE MY HUSBAND. THROUGH ALL OF OUR YEARS AND ALL THAT LIFE MAY BRING US. ALLYCE, DO YOU RECEIVE THIS RING IN HONOR OF THESE VOWS? I DO. STEPHAN, DO YOU RECEIVE THIS RING IN HONOR OF THESE VOWS? I SURELY DO. BY THE AUTHORITY VESTED IN ME, I PRONOUNCE YOU HUSBAND AND WIFE. MAKE OUT. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IT IS MY GREAT PLEASURE TO PRESENT TO YOU MR. AND MRS. HERVIEUX. HERE WE GO! MR. AND MRS. HERVIEUX, EVERYBODY! SHE SAID YES! WHEN YOU'RE AMONGST YOUR CLOSEST AND DEAREST FRIENDS AND FAMILY... THAT JOY RUNS THROUGH YOU AND IT SPREADS. I JUST FELT SO LOVED. WE SAVED AS MUCH MONEY AS WE COULD FOR THE CEREMONY. I DON'T KNOW HOW STEPH DID IT. HE THREW HIS HEART AND HIS SOUL INTO THIS CEREMONY AND HE MADE IT BEAUTIFUL. LITTLE DORA! HEY! I PRESENT TO YOU MR. AND MRS. STEPHAN AND ALLYCE HERVIEUX. MR. AND MRS. HERVIEUX! LIVING OUT HERE HAS TAUGHT ME THAT WHATEVER I NEED, I CAN GIVE MYSELF. I CAN HANDLE EVERYTHING. IT'S TAUGHT ME SO MUCH. WE HAVE A GREAT FAMILY OUT ON THE LAKE, AND I WOULDN'T TRADE THIS WAY OF LIFE FOR ANYTHING. I LOVE IT. BRING IT IN, PEOPLE. COME ON. BRING IT IN. THANK YOU. RIGHT ON. I DON'T GET AN AWFUL LOT OF TIME TO SOCIALIZE, SO THIS WEDDING KIND OF GAVE ME A LITTLE BIT OF TIME TO ACTUALLY GET OUT AND SEE MY NEIGHBORS AGAIN AND SPEND A LITTLE BIT OF TIME WITH THEM. IT WAS REALLY AN ENJOYABLE EVENING. I THINK PEOPLE BOND ON THE BAY BECAUSE THEY HAVE COMMON GROUND. THEY UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER'S SITUATION AND PROBLEMS, SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT HELPS PEOPLE CONVERGE CLOSE TOGETHER. AND THAT'S WHY I ENJOY THE HOUSEBOAT COMMUNITY IN YELLOWKNIFE. THANK YOU. THERE IS A REAL SENSE OF COMMUNITY IN THE HOUSEBOATS, AMONGST HOUSEBOATERS IN YELLOWKNIFE BAY. I'LL BET THAT IF A PERSON NEEDED HELP, NONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WOULD THINK TWICE ABOUT GOING AND PUTTING THEIR LIFE ON THE LINE TO HELP OUT SOMEBODY THAT NEEDED IT. AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES ME THINK THAT I'M JUST BETTER OFF WITH A HOUSEBOAT ON THE BAY. I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO EVERY ONE OF YOU FOR COMING HERE AND SHARING THIS MOMENTOUS OCCASION WITH US. THANK YOU ALL. THANKS FOR THE BEAUTIFUL CAKE, MOLLY. YOU'RE WELCOME. I'M DEFINITELY GLAD I CAME BACK TO THE NORTH TO REJOIN THE COMMUNITY. THERE'S SUCH A NICE SENSE OF COMMUNITY THAT YOU DON'T FIND IN THE CITY OR ANYWHERE ELSE HERE. I LOVE IT AND I'M JUST REALLY HAPPY TO BE HERE. READY? READY? THREE, TWO, ONE. I FEEL SO ALIVE. AND THAT'S WHY I LIVE HERE. SO, FOR ME, TO GET ON THE WATER, TO LIVE OFF THE GRID... IT'S A FEELING I'VE NEVER FELT IN MY LIFE. AND NOT LIVING ON THIS LAKE IS NOT AN OPTION FOR ME. COME ON, DORA. THERE SHE IS. GOOD GIRL. THIS HAS BEEN JUST A DREAM-COME-TRUE KIND OF A DAY. IT'S BEEN PERFECT. BUT I AM SO HAPPY TO GATHER STEPH AND DORA UP AND TO HEAD HOME. IF THIS HOUSEBOAT IS A-ROCKIN', DON'T COME A-KNOCKIN'.
