 'CAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT COULD HAPPEN. SHOOTING ON THIS LAKE IS A TASK FEW HAVE EVER UNDERTAKEN. YOU ALL RIGHT? YEAH. ONE OF MY MEMORIES OF THIS SHOW IS JUST TAKING LAYERS ON AND OFF. ALL DAY, IT WAS LIKE FIVE LAYERS ON, FIVE LAYERS OFF. AND YOU CAN'T HAVE ANY SWEAT ON YOU, 'CAUSE ONCE IT HITS MINUS-40, LIKE, NO MOISTURE. IT'LL JUST KILL YOU. HERE, THE SEASONS ARE MARKED NOT BY THE CHANGING OF THE LEAVES BUT BY THE MOOD OF THE LAKE. THE LAKE IS ALWAYS MOVING, ALWAYS CHANGING. SHE'S VERY UNPREDICTABLE. IT'S FREAKIN' GREAT SLAVE, MAN. AAH! IT'S A DEADLY LAKE THAT KILLS PEOPLE EVERY YEAR. THERE ARE TWO SEASONS ON GREAT SLAVE LAKE THAT ARE PARTICULARLY DEADLY, FREEZE-UP AND BREAK-UP, THAT MID-TIME WHEN THE LAKE IS NEITHER COMPLETELY WATER NOR COMPLETELY ICE. YOU GOT TO KEEP IN MIND THAT THE TEMPERATURE OF THE WATER IS JUST AROUND FREEZING. IF YOU GO IN, YOU'VE GOT THREE TO SIX MINUTES BEFORE PARALYSIS SETS IN. FILMING IN THESE CONDITIONS HAS RARELY BEEN TRIED BEFORE. STEPHAN HERVIEUX, A FOUR-YEAR RESIDENT, IS ABOUT TO TEACH THE CREW HOW TO NEGOTIATE THE UNSTABLE ICE TYPICAL TO THREE MONTHS OUT OF EVERY YEAR. GOOD MORNING, EVERYBODY. AS YOU CAN TELL, THE LAST 48 HOURS, THE LAKE HAS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY. WE'VE HAD SOME RAIN, WHICH BRINGS ON A SPEED-UP OF BREAK-UP. SEE THE WHITE? THE WHITE'S ALL RIGHT. STAY ON THE WHITE, BUT TREAD SLOWLY AND CAREFULLY. THIS DARK GREEN IS YOUR ENEMY. IT'S CANDLED. YOU WILL NOT HAVE A SECOND OR TWO TO THINK ABOUT IT. YOU WILL GO THROUGH. MOST OF THE CREW IS FROM LOS ANGELES. I ACTUALLY COME FROM CHICAGO, SO I'M USED TO WORKING IN THE COLD. BUT IT'S A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT KIND OF COLD UP HERE. WHEN YOU ENTER A CANOE, HERE'S WHAT NOT TO DO. ON THE SIDE... YOU'RE GONNA FLIP IT. ON THAT SIDE, YOU'RE GONNA FLIP IT. STAND IN THE CENTER. I'VE NEVER CANOED BEFORE THIS SHOW. I CANOED ON THE FIRST DAY I WAS HERE WHEN THERE WAS STILL ICE ON THE WATER. AND NOW I'M CANOEING, YOU KNOW, WITH A COUPLE $30,000 CAMERAS. YOU'RE ALWAYS GONNA BE HITTING WATER FIRST AT BOTH SHORES. AND WHEN YOU GET ON TOP OF ICE, TRY TO PLANT, OKAY? SO LIKE THIS AND DO THE PELVIC THRUST. AND THE OTHER GUY WILL PADDLE. THERE WERE JUST SOME SITUATIONS ON THIS SHOW THAT, LIKE, YOU JUST CAN'T PREPARE FOR. I MEAN, THERE'S NO EQUIPMENT MADE FOR BREAK-UP. IT'S JUST AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE. SO MANY ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME MOMENTS. ONE OF THE MOST DANGEROUS SCENES CAPTURED DURING LAST FALL'S FREEZE-UP WAS ON BOARD THE KIMBERLITE... READY? I WON'T POINT OUT THAT I KEEP GETTING THE HEAVY END. HEY, HEY, HEY. ...AS OWNERS STEPHAN AND ALLYCE BATTLED TO KEEP THEIR HOUSE FROM SINKING ONCE THEIR FLOATS TOOK ON WATER. WE'RE TILTED RIGHT NOW, SO WE'RE TRYING TO BALANCE OUR BOAT, MOVING AROUND ALL OUR PROPANE TANKS, OUR PELLETS. JUST TRYING TO GET IT LEVEL. LOOK AT THIS. THAT'S FAST. I DON'T NEED THAT TO TELL ME. I'M SLIDING LIKE THAT. I'M SORRY, I JUST THOUGHT I'D DEMONSTRATE IT. OKAY. LIVING ON A HOUSEBOAT CAN BE VERY TRYING. NO MATTER WHAT YOU KNOW, THINGS WILL GO AWRY. BUT YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU CAN DO UNTIL YOU ARE FACED WITH THE ADVERSITY OF IT HAPPENING. HOLY CRAP! WHAT HAPPENED? GEEZ. AS THE SITUATION TURNS LIFE-THREATENING, WITH THE BOAT IN SERIOUS DANGER OF CAPSIZING, ALL PRESENT MUST LEND AN IMMEDIATE HAND. OKAY, LET'S GET ON THIS. WE THOUGHT WE WERE GOING DOWN. WE WERE GOING DOWN. THERE WAS NO TWO WAYS ABOUT IT. WE WERE LOSING THAT HOUSE, MAN. STAY ON THE LEFT, GUYS. EVERYBODY NEEDS TO STAY ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE HOUSE. NOBODY ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE HOUSE. EVEN THE CREW CAPTURING THE ACTION BECAME ENLISTED, USING THEIR BODY WEIGHT AS COUNTERBALANCE. THAT CORNER LOOKS TOTALLY UNDER. OKAY, LET'S DROP EVERYTHING, MOVE EVERYTHING TO THIS SIDE. NOW, NOW, NOW, NOW, NOW. MOVE AS MUCH AS YOU CAN TO THE OTHER SIDE. I need anyone who is filming to come to Stephan and allyce's house. There is actually an emergency going on. WE'VE HAD TO MOVE EVERYTHING... ALL OF OUR GEAR, EVERYTHING... ON THIS SIDE OF THE BOAT, INCLUDING OURSELVES. WE'VE HAD TO STAY ON THIS SIDE BECAUSE THIS HOUSE IS SO TILTED THAT IT COULD ACTUALLY FLIP OVER AT ANY MOMENT. SO IT'S REALLY CRITICAL THAT EVERY ONE OF US CONTINUES TO TRY TO FLATTEN THIS BOAT OUT, BECAUSE IT COULD GO. NOW, THIS STEP HERE SHOULD BE AS HIGH AS THAT ONE THERE. SO YOU CAN TELL THAT WE'RE LISTING. OBVIOUSLY. OUR HOUSEBOAT IS FLOATING ON TWO ALUMINUM PONTOONS THAT GO THE LENGTH OF THE HOUSE. THEY'RE EACH SET UP WITH SEPARATE SECTIONS. IF ONE OF THE FLOATS DOES GET FLOODED, THEN, ESPECIALLY IN FREEZE-UP, YOU NEED TO FIX IT RIGHT AWAY. AS STEPHAN CHANGES INTO A HEAVY DRY SUIT IN ORDER TO SURVIVE THE HYPOTHERMIA-INDUCING WATERS OF THE LAKE, CAMERAMAN BRIAN KEENAN GETS THE SHOTS AS SAFETY PERSONNEL STAND BY. THIS SHOW HAS HAD PROBABLY THE MOST EXTREME WORKING CONDITIONS THAT I'VE DEALT WITH IN MY CAREER. I MEAN, EVERYBODY WORKS THEIR ASS OFF TO MAKE THIS SHOW HAPPEN, BUT EVERYONE'S ALSO REALLY AWARE OF SAFETY, BECAUSE WE ARE DOING THINGS THAT ARE VERY DANGEROUS. NO. MY GOD! YEAH, IT'S JUST GETTING HARD TO WALK 'CAUSE MY FEET ARE NUMB. THERE ARE SO MANY LEAKS IN THIS SUIT. IN AND OUT, BABE. IN AND OUT. THIS IS SO COLD. I THOUGHT, "WE COULD LOSE THE HOUSE TODAY." I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. I WAS JUST... I DIDN'T WANT TO LOSE STEPH, TOO, SO I WAS MORE WORRIED ABOUT HIM THAN I WAS OF THE HOUSE. MAN. THIS DRY SUIT IS SAVING HIM, BUT HE CAN'T SPEND LONG UNDER THERE. THERE'S NO WAY. FOUR HOURS LATER, STEPHAN AND ALLYCE REMAIN LOCKED IN A BATTLE WITH THE LAKE TO KEEP IT FROM TAKING THEIR HOME. I THINK I GOT IT. I THINK WE'RE GOOD TO GO. WE'RE WILLING TO RISK OUR LIVES A LITTLE BIT FOR THE PEACE OF BEING ON THE BAY. IT'S WORTH IT. AND YOU TAKE EVERYTHING IN STRIDE. YOU HAVE RESPECT FOR THE LAKE, YOU'LL MAKE IT. THIS IS GREAT. EVERYTHING IS A-OKAY, IN MY OPINION. LOOK AT THAT. LOOK AT ALL THAT CLEARANCE. I HAD TO FIGHT FOR MY HOUSE AND MY SURVIVAL TODAY. I FEEL ALIVE, MORE ALIVE THAN I'VE EVER FELT IN MY ENTIRE EXISTENCE LIVING IN NORMAL CONDITIONS. WE MADE IT, BABY! WE MADE IT. I LOVE YOU, DARLING. YOU'RE THE BEST. YOU'RE THE BEST. FOR DECADES, THE LAKE AND ITS PROMISE OF LIVING FREE HAS ATTRACTED REBELS SEEKING THE INDEPENDENCE OF LIFE OFF THE GRID. IF IT GOES ON THE TOP, IT'LL MAKE IT TIPPIER, RIGHT? DON'T YOU THINK? YEAH. IMAN KASSAM AND JESSICA FLORIO WERE NO EXCEPTION, ALTHOUGH THEIR TIMING WAS BOLD. THERE'S PROBABLY, LIKE, A WAY MORE EFFICIENT WAY OF DOING THIS. IT NEEDS ATTACHED? IT'S SUCH A SCARY TRANSITION TO MOVE ON A HOUSEBOAT IN THE WINTER DURING FREEZE-UP FOR THE FIRST TIME. BUT WE'RE PRETTY ADVENTUROUS, YOU KNOW? WE'RE YOUNG. WE'RE CRAZY. WHY NOT? WHY NOT? DON'T TIP US. AS THE FREEZE GETS CLOSER AND AS MORE ICE IS ON THE LAKE, I AM A LITTLE BIT MORE NERVOUS. WHOA, WHOA, WHOA! AAH! THE NEWBIES, IMAN AND JESSICA, MAKE A VIDEO DIARY OF THEIR FIRST NIGHTS AS HOUSEBOATERS, EXPERIENCING THE MAGIC OF A LAKE ABOUT TO FREEZE. YOU SEE THIS LAYER OF ICE AT ALL? THIS IS ALL WE HAVE RIGHT NOW. THIS THIN... LITTLE LAYER OF ICE IS REALLY COLD, OBVIOUSLY. AND THIS FORMED IN... I DON'T KNOW... LESS THAN AN HOUR. AND YOU CAN HEAR IT FORMING ALL ACROSS THE LAKE RIGHT NOW. IT'S, LIKE, GOING... I REALLY LOVE ICE. DO THAT AGAIN. TAKE A PIECE OF ICE AND THEN THROW IT ON THE REST OF THE ICE, AND YOU CAN HEAR... LISTEN. THESE HOME VIDEOS SHOW THE NAIVE WONDER THEY BOTH FELT, NEWLY ARRIVED, AS THE LAKE AROUND THEM STARTED TO FREEZE. WE GOT ICE ON THE LAKE. JUST A LITTLE BIT. IT'LL MELT THROUGHOUT THE DAY, BUT WE GOT THE SMALLEST LITTLE LAYER OF ICE ON THE LAKE TODAY. THAT WAS PRETTY MAGICAL. YOU KNOW, THAT'S, LIKE, A REALLY POWERFUL SYSTEM, OUR ENVIRONMENT. BUT A SHORT 10 HOURS AFTER THIS VIDEO WAS FILMED... EEE! ...THEIR NEW WORLD TURNED UPSIDE DOWN. AAH! SO, I'M AT THE BACK OF THE BOAT, AND I HEAR IMAN SCREAMING MY NAME. MY GOD! AND YOU KNOW THAT FEELING WHERE YOUR HEART JUST SORT OF SINKS? YOU JUST KNOW SOMETHING IS WRONG. AND I JUST BOLTED TO THE FRONT DOOR I, RIGHT AWAY, SAW THAT SHE WAS IN THE WATER. SHE HAD FALLEN THROUGH THE ICE, AND SHE LOOKED SO SCARED. OKAY. TAKE MY BOOTS OFF. OKAY. YOU'RE OKAY. HEY, LOOK AT ME. YOU'RE OKAY. WE'RE GONNA GET INSIDE, TAKE ALL YOUR CLOTHES OFF. TAKE OFF MY BOOTS. SHE WAS JUST YELLING, LIKE, THAT SHE COULDN'T FEEL HER FEET, AND SO I YANKED HER BOOTS OFF. AND THEN WE KIND OF HALF-CRAWLED AND WE HALF-DRAGGED HER INSIDE AS FAST AS POSSIBLE. YOU'RE OKAY. YOU'RE OKAY. SIT IN FRONT OF THE FIRE. I HAD LOST ALL SENSATION OF MY TOES, MY LEGS. AND IT WAS SO CLEAR TO ME HOW IMPOSSIBLE IT WAS TO GET OUT. LIKE, I JUST DIDN'T FEEL STRONG. AND I WAS BREATHING SO PANICKY AND HEAVILY, AND IT WAS... IT WAS A REALLY WEIRD FEELING. THIS IS YOUR BOOT. I WAS LUCKY THAT I WENT THROUGH THE ICE CLOSE TO THE HOUSE WHEN PEOPLE WERE AROUND. I'VE HEARD STORIES OF PEOPLE ON THE LAKE THAT HAVE FALLEN THROUGH IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LAKE. PEOPLE HAVE DIED FALLING THROUGH THE ICE. THE LAKE'S NOT PLAYING BY OUR RULES, WE'RE PLAYING BY THE LAKE'S RULES. IT WAS REALLY SCARY. WE'RE DRIVING BETWEEN TWO BODIES OF OPEN WATER, AND YOU CAN HEAR THE CRACKING FROM THE PRESSURE WAVE THAT WE'RE PUTTING OUT. **** **** POPPED THE ICE. WE POPPED THE ICE. STOP! STOP! AS WE GO BEHIND THE SCENES ON GREAT SLAVE LAKE, CAMERAS ROLLED WITH EXTREME CAUTION DURING THE TWO MOST DEADLY SEASONS, FREEZE-UP IN THE FALL AND BREAK-UP IN THE SPRING, WHEN MEGATONS OF ICE FLOES BEGIN TO FORM OR THAW. THIS IS A CRAZY BREAK-UP. I'VE NEVER SEEN A BREAK-UP LIKE THIS. THE ICE CONDITIONS HERE ON THE LAKE HAVE CHANGED DRAMATICALLY IN THE LAST 48 HOURS. NOW YOU'VE GOT GREEN ICE, WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY DEADLY, AND THEN YOU'VE GOT SAFE ICE, WHICH IS WHITE ICE. IT WAS A FEW WEEKS BEFORE BREAK-UP, DURING A FRIENDLY COMMUNITY COMPETITION, WHEN THE LAKE SENT OUT ITS FIRST WARNING TO CAST AND CREW. THIN ICE IS HERE. CONGRATULATIONS. THANK YOU, WE'RE BOILING! WE'RE BOILING! WE'RE BOILING! WE'RE BOILING HERE, BOSS! COME ON, HURRY UP! **** WHOA! JOHN! MEDIC! MEDIC! YOU DON'T WANT TO FALL IN THIS WATER. YOU HAVE SECONDS TO GET OUT. I GOT YOU, I GOT YOU, I GOT YOU. YOU CAN'T BREATHE. JUST THE SHOCK OF THE WATER, IT TAKES YOUR BREATH AWAY, AND YOU JUST PANIC. MEDIC! MANY PEOPLE HAVE DIED IN THIS LAKE. I GOT YOU, I GOT YOU, I GOT YOU. THE LAKE CLAIMS A VICTIM, A VETERAN, THE VERY FIRST HOUSEBOATER, JOHN ALEXANDER... YOU ALL RIGHT, BUD? YOU FALL INTO THAT WATER, YOU'VE GOT A PROBLEM. HOW YOU DOING? OKAY? THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME, BOSS. ...A STARK REMINDER THAT CELEBRATION ON THE ICE CAN BE SHORT-LIVED AND THAT THE LAKE IS ALWAYS IN CONTROL. WE'VE NEVER LOST A HOUSEBOATER. WE'VE LOST A COUPLE SORT OF "CIVILIANS," IF YOU WILL. YEAH. YEAH, YEAH. BUT WE NEVER LOST A HOUSEBOATER. FIGHTING THE JAGGED ICE LEFT JOHN BRUISED AND BLEEDING, FORCING HIM TO SEEK MEDICAL ATTENTION. ONCE YOU START GETTING TOO CONFIDENT WITH THE ICE, THAT'S WHEN IT GETS DANGEROUS. JOHN, ARE YOU OKAY? YOU ALL RIGHT? 100%. YEAH? I'VE DONE THIS BEFORE. DO YOU NEED ME TO TAKE YOU BACK AND GET SOME MORE CLOTHES? I'M NOT GONNA HEAR THE END OF THIS FOR A LONG, LONG TIME. A LOT OF THE PEOPLE FROM TOWN WOULDN'T EVEN VENTURE OUT ONTO THE ICE AT THIS TIME OF YEAR FOR FEAR OF FALLING THROUGH. YOUR HAND LOOKS LIKE IT WENT THROUGH THE RINGER THERE. - IT'S ALONG THE SIDE HERE. - REALLY? YEAH. SEE A LITTLE BIT THERE? YEAH. JUST ANOTHER WAR WOUND. WELL, BREAK-UP'S COMING PRETTY SOON, AND IT'S QUITE DANGEROUS. THIS IS SERIOUS BUSINESS, WHEN YOU FALL THROUGH THE ICE. TO SURVIVE SPRING HERE REQUIRES PARENTS TEACHING THEIR CHILDREN A DIFFERENT SET OF SURVIVAL SKILLS, AS GARY VAILLANCOURT BRINGS HIS DAUGHTER, MOLLY, IN TOW FOR A LIFE-OR-DEATH LESSON IN SURVIVING THE LAKE AS ITS ICE BREAKS APART. I CAN'T HEAR ANYTHING. I DON'T ABOUT THIS ONE. THIS IS LIKE THROWING YOURSELF... MY GOD! THAT'S HOW QUICK IT HAPPENS. AND NOW I'M THERE, FREAKING OUT. IT WAS DEFINITELY STARTLING TO HAVE MY DAD FALL THROUGH THE ICE WHEN I WASN'T ANTICIPATING THAT, 'CAUSE HE'S A BIT OF A VETERAN HOUSEBOATER, SO I THOUGHT HE KNEW WHERE... WHAT WAS GOING ON. AND THEN HE FELL THROUGH, AND I WAS KIND OF LIKE, "MAN. THIS IS NOT LOOKING GOOD FOR ME." HAVING LIVED ON THE LAKE FOR OVER 30 YEARS, GARY HAS SURVIVED MANY CLOSE CALLS AND SHOWS MOLLY THE PROPER WAY TO SURVIVE A FALL. LIKE A PRO! AND THEN GO GET DRY. SO, THIS IS JUST A TASTE. IT'S NOT THE REAL THING. THE REAL THING IS TERRIFYING. YOU ARE IN BIG TROUBLE IF YOU ARE DOING WHAT WE WERE DOING TODAY. AND YOU'VE GOT VERY LITTLE TIME TO GET OUT OF THE WATER. SO, YOU KNOW, THE BEST THING TO DO IS TO LEARN HOW TO AVOID IT. SO THAT'S WHAT WE WERE TRYING TO DO TODAY. NOW, REMEMBER, PRACTICE YOUR DROPPING. THERE YOU GO. AAH! FIRST THING YOU GOT TO WORRY ABOUT IS PANIC, ALL RIGHT? GARY TEACHES MOLLY TO ROLL AWAY FROM THIN ICE, THEREBY SPREADING HER WEIGHT. WELL DONE. THAT'S AWESOME. I WAS SCARED WHEN I FIRST POPPED THROUGH THAT ICE. LIKE, IT WAS REAL. AND THE SHOCK KIND OF HITS YOU RIGHT AT ONCE, AND IT'S JUST... IT BECOMES A REALITY, AND IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG, I COULD BE IN SERIOUS DANGER. WITH THINNING ICE SURPRISING EVEN VETERAN HOUSEBOATERS, EXECUTIVE PRODUCER KATHRYN HAYDN-HAYS WAS CONCERNED CONDITIONS WERE BECOMING TOO DANGEROUS FOR FILMING. SO, WITH SAFETY PERSONNEL STANDING BY, SHE TESTS THE ICE'S INTEGRITY AND THE FLOAT SUITS THE CREW WOULD BE WEARING WHILE SHOOTING. AAH! THE IDEA IS THAT YOU HAVE THESE SUITS, AND IF YOU BREAK THROUGH THE ICE, THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO KEEP YOU ALIVE. WELL, YOU KNOW, WE'RE OUT THERE DAY-TO-DAY WORKING IN THESE, BUT, YOU KNOW, NOBODY REALLY KNOWS. NOBODY'S HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT. SO WHAT DOES KATHRYN DO? SHE DELIBERATELY GOES INTO THE WATER IN THE FLOAT SUIT TO VERIFY THAT THEY ACTUALLY WORK AND THAT THEY'RE GONNA KEEP HER CREW SAFE. WHOA! **** - THEY FLOAT! THEY FLOAT! YES! THEY ARE NOT AIRTIGHT! HOLY **** THE FLOAT SUITS ARE DESIGNED TO KEEP EVEN AN UNCONSCIOUS PERSON FLOATING AWAITING RESCUE, AND THEY BECOME ESSENTIAL TO SHOOTING ON THE CRUMBLING LAKE. I SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN GLOVES. KNOWING WHAT TO DO AFTER FALLING THROUGH THE ICE GREATLY REDUCES THE RISK OF INJURY OR DEATH. MY GOD! IT'S SO **** COLD! THE GOOD NEWS IS YOU'LL FLOAT. THE BAD NEWS IS... YOU DO GET REALLY COLD IN THESE SUITS. BUT, HEY, I KNOW THAT WE'LL BE ALIVE. WITH DAYS LEFT BEFORE THE LAKE'S ICE GIVES WAY, THE CREW FOLLOWED FISHERMAN BRIAN ABBOTT, OUT FOR HIS LAST DAY OF ICE FISHING. TODAY, I'M GONNA PULL THE NETS OUT. THIS'LL BE THE LAST DAY. IT'LL BE A MONTH TO MAYBE EVEN SIX WEEKS BEFORE THE LAKE IS SAFE ENOUGH TO START FISHING WITH A BOAT AGAIN. WE'VE PROBABLY ONLY GOT 24, 36 HOURS, AND IT'S GONNA START GETTING UNSAFE. I'M HOPING THIS'LL BE A BIG HAUL, 'CAUSE THIS IS THE LAST RUN FOR THE SEASON. AS BRIAN HEADS OUT ON A 35-MILE JOURNEY TO HIS NET LINE, THE CREW PACKS UP TO FOLLOW HIM. ALL RIGHT, LET'S PACK IT UP, GUYS. ROLL 'EM UP. WE WERE FILMING BRIAN'S LAST FISHING TRIP OF THE SEASON, AND IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE WERE OUT THERE WITH HIM TO FILM THAT LAST EXPERIENCE. BUT THE ICE WAS VERY SKETCHY. SO WE HAD THE ARCTIC RESPONSE SAFETY UNIT AND WE TOOK A VEHICLE CALLED THE ARGO. AND IT'S SORT OF LIKE A MINI-TANK, BUT IT'S LIKE A CONVERTIBLE. THIS IS ACTUALLY A PRETTY COOL VEHICLE. HOPEFULLY, IT'LL KEEP US ALIVE, RIGHT? THE CREW SHOOTING THIS DANGEROUS SCENE FOLLOW BEHIND ON A SEMI-AMPHIBIOUS VEHICLE, WHICH WILL HOLD THEM AND ALL THEIR GEAR, SUPPORTED BY AN ARCTIC FIRST RESPONDER. TODAY, WE'RE HEADED ABOUT 26 KILOMETERS OUT ONTO GREAT SLAVE LAKE, OUT TO THE FISHNETS. AND WE'RE ON AN ARGO 8x8 TRACK VEHICLE. GREAT. READY? HERE WE GO. THERE WILL BE FIVE OF US GOING OUT TODAY, AND WE'LL BE LOOKING FOR ANY SOFT SPOTS IN THE ICE, ANY OPEN WATER. WE'LL TRY TO AVOID IT. THE ICE IS INCREDIBLY SKETCHY OUT THERE. IT'S ALREADY MIDDLE OF MAY, SO IT'S BREAKING UP FAST. THE SIX-FEET-DEEP ICE IS NOW ONLY THREE INCHES IN SOME SPOTS, BARELY ABLE TO SUPPORT THE VEHICLE, WHICH MUST MAINTAIN A CONSTANT SPEED IN ORDER TO AVOID DROPPING THROUGH. YEAH. YEAH. THE PRESSURE WAVE. WE'RE DRIVING BETWEEN TWO BODIES OF OPEN WATER, SO THERE'S ABOUT 50 FEET ON EITHER SIDE OF US OF THAT OPEN WATER, AND YOU CAN HEAR THE CRACKING FROM THE PRESSURE WAVE THAT WE'RE PUTTING OUT. IT'S KIND OF WEIRD. NONE OF US WERE TOO WORRIED, THOUGH, BECAUSE NOBODY THOUGHT THAT ANYTHING BAD WAS GONNA HAPPEN. YEAH. **** STOP! STOP! TRY AND LIFT THAT THING. CAN YOU LIFT IT? LIFT IT HARDER. HARDER! HARDER. YOU WERE BASICALLY IN A VERY SMALL SPACE, AND THE WATER IS PRETTY MUCH LEVEL WITH THE SIDES OF THE ARGO. AND THERE'S NOTHING AROUND US BUT THE SAME COMPROMISED, WEAK-LOOKING ICE. AS SOON AS I WOULD GIVE IT THE GAS, IT WAS JUST CHEWING THROUGH THE ICE. SO IT WAS JUST... IT WAS SORT OF DEEPENING THE HOLE THAT WE WERE IN, MAKING MORE WATER AROUND, BUT WE WEREN'T MAKING ANY PROGRESS. WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA! IT'S MAKING IT WORSE. MAN. **** PULL! PULL, PULL. COME ON! I TOTALLY THOUGHT IT WAS HOPELESS. IT WAS JUST CREATING MORE SLUSH AROUND IT. I MEAN, IN MY MIND, I'M THINKING, "THERE'S NO **** WAY THAT THAT THING'S EVER GONNA GET OUT ON THE ICE." ONE OF THE MOST CHALLENGING SEASONS ON GREAT SLAVE LAKE IS BREAK-UP, WHEN 10,000 SQUARE MILES OF ICE LET GO, SOMETIMES... JOHN! I GOT YOU. ...RIGHT UNDER YOUR FEET. AS WE JOURNEY BEHIND THE SCENES ON GREAT SLAVE LAKE, BRIAN ABBOTT HAS TAKEN OFF ACROSS THE THAWING ICE FOR HIS LAST ICE-FISHING VENTURE. THE CREW WAS ON THEIR WAY TO SHOOTING... **** POPPED THE ICE. WE POPPED THE ICE. STOP! STOP! ...WHEN THEIR AMPHIBIOUS MACHINE PLUNGED THROUGH THE THIN ICE... TAKING THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS OF EQUIPMENT WITH IT AND STRANDING THE CREW ON UNSTABLE ICE. WE NEED TO GET THE GEAR OUT OF THERE, THE ELECTRONICS. AT THAT POINT, IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT WE REMEMBER OUR TRAINING. AND YOU CAN'T JUST, LIKE, GET OUT AND WALK, 'CAUSE YOU'RE GONNA BREAK THROUGH THE ICE. SO YOU HAVE TO DO, LIKE, A BODY ROLL, BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING AROUND US BUT THE SAME COMPROMISED, WEAK-LOOKING ICE. TYLER, OUR ARCTIC RESPONSE SAFETY GUY... BLESS HIS HEART. HE'S ACTUALLY TRYING ONE OF HIS RESCUE METHODS. THE IDEA IS THAT HE HAS A WINCH ON THE FRONT OF THE ARGO AND HE HAS AN ICE SCREW. AND THE IDEA IS THAT HE SCREWS IN THE ICE SCREW INTO THE ICE. THEN, HE USES THE WINCH TO PULL THE ARGO OUT. EVERYBODY ON THE CREW, WE WERE LOOKING AT EACH OTHER AND WATCHING THIS HAPPEN. AND, "OKAY, YEAH, WE'LL BE GOOD SPORTS." BUT, I MEAN, IN MY MIND, I'M THINKING, "THERE'S NO **** WAY THAT THAT THING'S EVER GONNA GET OUT ON THE ICE." EVERYBODY'S READY? READY. GO AHEAD. WINCH. GOOD. PULL! PULL. PULL. COME ON. COME ON! THE WATER DIDN'T COMING RUSHING INTO THE ARGO, SO THAT WAS A GOOD THING. IT WAS GOING UP ONTO THE ICE AT ALL. IT WAS JUST CREATING MORE SLUSH AROUND IT. I TOTALLY THOUGHT IT WAS HOPELESS. ARE WE GOOD? THROTTLE. PULL! COME ON. WE DID THIS LIKE ABOUT 10 TIMES, AND I DON'T THINK ANYBODY THOUGHT THAT THIS THING WAS GETTING OUT OF THE ICE. BUT, YOU KNOW, TYLER'S LIKE, "COME ON, GUYS. LET'S GIVE IT ONE MORE GO." OKAY, WINCH AND THROTTLE. THAT'S IT, THAT'S IT, THAT'S IT! IT STARTED TO CLIMB. I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. IT JUST CLIMBED AND CLIMBED AND CLIMBED. YEAH, BABY! WHOO! WHOO! UNBELIEVABLE. IT WAS AMAZING TO ME. I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. I MEAN, IT WAS JUST... IT WAS A GREAT FEELING. YEAH! YEAH! YEAH, BABY! WHOO! I JUST FELT ELATED. IT WAS THE BEST FEELING I'VE FELT ALL DAY. IT WAS A CLOSE ONE. AT LEAST I CAN SPEAK FOR MYSELF ON THAT. LET'S GO. NO? OKAY. READY? READY. THE CREW WAS LUCKY THIS DAY AND TRAVELED THE REST OF THE WAY WITHOUT INCIDENT TO SHOOT THIS SCENE. GONNA HURT. I NEED MORE FISH, BUT... IT IS WHAT IT IS. I GUESS I CAN'T COMPLAIN. THE SEASON'S LASTED LONGER THIS YEAR THAN USUAL, SO. IT'S QUITE DANGEROUS THIS TIME OF YEAR IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING. SO PART OF BEING SAFE OUT HERE IS KNOWING THE ICE. I GOT LOTS OF WATER AROUND THE HOLES, OF COURSE, GETTING THE ICE ALL WET AND MELTING IT AROUND THE HOLE MUCH QUICKER. WHOA! YOU'RE OUT THERE, YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN. THERE'S NOBODY COMING TO GET YOU UNTIL YOU LET THEM KNOW THAT YOU'RE STUCK. MOST OF THE TIME, YOU'RE OUT OF PHONE SERVICE. WHY AM I DOING THIS AND NOBODY ELSE IS? I'M NOT SURE. MAYBE I AM NUTS. THE SPRING THAW MOVES SEVERAL THOUSAND TONS OF ICE THROUGH THE BAY AS IT TRANSFORMS THE LAKE BACK INTO ARCTIC WATERS. NOW NAVIGATING THIS WORLD WILL REQUIRE A CONSTANT BALANCING ACT. WITH THIS SHOW, I MEAN, IT WAS A LOT OF KIND OF SKETCHY SITUATIONS ON, YOU KNOW, WE'RE GONNA GO FROM A CANOE TO ANOTHER BOAT. THEN, WE GOT TO CROSS ONTO ANOTHER BOAT. THEN, WE CAN GO TO WHERE WE'RE GOING. EVEN WALKING A FEW FEET BETWEEN HOUSEBOATS PROVES CHALLENGING. WHOA. YOU GOT IT, STEVE. WHOO! HOT-DOGGIN' IT. NEXT. YOU ALL RIGHT? HOLY **** WE ARE OUT OF GAS. I DON'T THINK WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT OVER THERE, SO WE MIGHT AS WELL START WALKING. RANDY REALIZES THAT WE'RE JUST HUMANS, RIGHT? GREAT SLAVE LAKE DOESN'T PLAY FAVORITES, AND THE CREW SHOOTING THE REBELS WHO LIVE HERE INVARIABLY BECOMES PART OF THE UNFOLDING DRAMA THEMSELVES. LOTS OF ICE HERE. AS FISHERMAN BRIAN ABBOTT ATTEMPTS HIS FIRST SPRING FISHING EXCURSION AFTER BREAK-UP, HE HITS A ROAMING ICE FLOE, ONE OF MANY WHICH CAN LAST INTO SUMMER. RUNNING OVER TOP OF THE ICE IS KIND OF HARD ON THE BOAT ITSELF, BEING FIBERGLASS. ICE IS ACTUALLY QUITE ABRASIVE. IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL, AS WELL, IT'LL JUST CHEW THE HELL OUT OF YOUR PROP. HALFWAY THERE. BUT, WITH THE CREW FOLLOWING CLOSELY BEHIND, BRIAN'S BOAT SUCCUMBS TO THE ICE. MY STEERING JUST STRIPPED. THAT MEANS I HAVE NO STEERING ANYMORE. SUFFERING A BREAKDOWN THIS FAR FROM YELLOWKNIFE BAY COULD LEAVE BRIAN ADRIFT. HOLY **** WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO STEER, BRIAN BEGINS ROWING HIS 1,000-POUND BOAT BACK TO YELLOWKNIFE. YOU'RE AGAINST THE ELEMENTS. YOU'RE AGAINST THE LAKE. YOU'RE AGAINST THE WAVES. YOU'RE AGAINST THE WIND. YOU'RE AGAINST THE ICE. YOU KNOW, IT'S A BIT OF A HARD, TREACHEROUS LIFE OUT HERE. WELL, THAT'S NOT GOOD. AFTER THREE HOURS OF TRYING TO PADDLE BACK, BRIAN REQUESTED HELP GETTING OUT OF ROUGH CURRENTS IN ORDER TO MAKE IT BACK TO THE BAY. SO, RIGHT NOW, WE ARE OUT BREAKING THROUGH THE ICE. BRIAN LOST THE STEERING ON HIS BOAT. SO WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE TIED BOTH THE BOATS TOGETHER, AND OUR JOB IS TO HELP GUIDE HIM IN THE PROPER DIRECTION AND MAKE SURE THAT WE MISS ALL THE ROCKS. HE'S GOT A MOTOR, SO HE CAN KEEP GOING STRAIGHT, BUT HE HAS NO WAY OF STEERING RIGHT NOW. SO WE HAVE TO KIND OF NAVIGATE AND THREAD THE NEEDLE. THE SAME ROAMING ICE SHEETS WHICH TOOK OUT BRIAN'S STEERING BLOCKED RANDY FROM FLOATING HIS METAL PONTOONS INTO YELLOWKNIFE BAY... WELL, IT'S A LITTLE BIT FREAKY ONCE THE ICE KIND OF CLOSES IN AROUND YOU, AND IT ENGULFS YOU. AND THEN YOU WIND UP TRAPPED IN IT. ...FORCING HIM TO TIE OFF HERE, MILES AWAY FROM HIS DESTINATION. AND CIVILIZATION. SO, FOR NOW, FOR THE TIME BEING, THIS IS GONNA BE THE RESTING-PLACE FOR THIS RAFT. I'M GONNA GO BACK OVER TO MY HOUSEBOAT AND I'M GOING TO SIT DOWN AND I'M GONNA LOOK AT MY NUMBERS AGAIN AND REALLY TRY TO CONSIDER WHERE I UNDERESTIMATED THE WEIGHT OF THIS RAFT. AT THAT POINT, I'LL KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I'LL BE ABLE TO PUT ON HERE FOR A CABIN. IF IT WEREN'T FOR THE WIND, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EASY. BUT RANDY IS NOT THE ONLY ONE STRANDED AFTER WAITING HOURS FOR THE ICE TO GIVE WAY. YEAH. DON'T WORRY. THAT WASN'T ON... HOLY **** WOW. SO, WE MADE IT BY THE... YEAH, I DON'T THINK WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT OVER THERE WITH THAT IN THERE, SO WE MIGHT AS WELL START WALKING. AFTER WAITING FOR THE ICE TO CLEAR... THERE'S A TRAIL THAT GOES BACK OVER THIS WAY. ...PRODUCTION'S POWERBOAT IS NOW OUT OF GAS, AND THE CAST AND CREW ARE STRANDED MILES FROM THE NEAREST TOWN. WE RAN OUT OF GAS, AND WE ARE ONSHORE SOMEWHERE... SOMEWHERE OUTSIDE OF YELLOWKNIFE. WE'RE HIKING OVER TO HOPEFULLY MEET OUR SUPERVISING PRODUCER, ARI, WHO WILL HOPEFULLY HAVE GAS FOR US. GOOD TIMES, YO. GOOD TIMES. AS THE CREW TREKS MILES THROUGH ROCKY TERRAIN, FATIGUE BEGINS TO SET IN. CAREFUL. THESE ROCKS AREN'T STEADY. GOT TO BE **** KIDDING ME. **** NOW, BE CAREFUL WITH THESE, 'CAUSE THEY'RE NOT REAL... YOU CAN HOLD ON TO THEM, BUT THEY'RE **** THIS DOES NOT SEEM LIKE THIS... NO, NOT THIS. GO WITH THIS. ...IS A REALLY GOOD IDEA. I GOTCHA. THERE YOU GO. HANG ON. HERE, TAKE THIS, ARIEL. THESE ROCKS AREN'T STEADY. CANADIAN RANGER RANDY IS ALREADY A QUARTER-MILE AHEAD, SETTING A FAST PACE, TRYING TO BEAT THE SETTING SUN. **** RANDY REALIZES THAT WE'RE JUST HUMANS, RIGHT? WE'VE BEEN WORKING IN SOME INCREDIBLY TOUGH CONDITIONS, AND EVERYBODY WAS JUST... THEY JUST SUCKED IT UP. OUR TEAM'S BEEN SOLID ALL THE WAY ACROSS, SO COULDN'T BE HAPPIER. TURN THE **** MIKE OFF. Steph, are you there? HEY, HON. WHAT DO YOU NEED? There's a bear on the island. Get dora. Get off the island. NO **** WAY. **** JUST TOOK OFF. DORA! DORA! DURING SHOOTING ON YELLOWKNIFE BAY, SPRING HAS BROUGHT MUCH-NEEDED RELIEF TO THE HOUSEBOATERS AND THE CREW. ON A SMALL ISLAND NEAR THE HOUSEBOATS, STEPHAN HERVIEUX IS BUILDING AN ALTAR FOR HIS UPCOMING WEDDING. HERE IT IS 24 HOURS AND COUNTING BEFORE I'M SUPPOSED TO BE MARRIED, AND I'VE GOT TO BUILD AN ALTAR. I'VE GOT TO BUILD TABLES. I GOT TO BUILD A FIRE PIT. AND I'VE GOT LIKE NO TIME LEFT. ONE, TWO, THREE. I FOUND A GREAT LOCATION FOR THE WEDDING. IT'S ON THE HIGHEST POINT ON JOLLIFFE ISLAND, OVERLOOKING YELLOWKNIFE BAY AND THE HOUSEBOATS. THIS IS GONNA GO, LIKE, FROM HERE TO THERE. ATTENTION. A BLACK BEAR MAY CURRENTLY... BUT SPRING IS ALSO THE TIME WHEN BLACK BEARS ROUSE FROM THEIR DEN AND GO LOOKING FOR FOOD. ...IF YOU CANNOT EVACUATE. TAKE ALL FOOD INDOORS. Steph, Steph, are you there? HEY, HON. WHAT DO YOU NEED? There's a bear on the island. WHAT?! I just heard there's a bear on the island. Get dora. Get off the island. NO **** WAY. **** JUST TOOK OFF. Are you there? What's going on? DORA! DORA! GUYS, THERE'S A BEAR ON THE ISLAND. WE HAVE TO GET ON THE BOAT. YOU GUYS, GUESS WHAT. THAT CHOPPER IS OUTSIDE. WE GOT A BEAR ON THE ISLAND. WE'VE GOT A FISH PLANT WITH FISH, AND THAT'S PROBABLY THE MOST LIKELY REASON HE WAS ON THE ISLAND TO BEGIN WITH. WE BETTER GET THIS STUFF MOVED OUT OF THE DOOR HERE AND GET THIS DOOR CLOSED. YEAH, WE'VE GOT TO GET THAT BACK DOOR CLOSED. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHAT ARE YOU DOING, BUM-BUM? COME HERE. COME HERE. ARE YOU OKAY? CRAZY DORA. SCARED THE **** OUT OF ME. ALLYCE? Go ahead. I GOT HER. I'M COMING HOME NOW. Good. I'll keep an eye out, let you know if I see anything. 10-4. LET'S GO. BEAR PROBLEMS, FOR US, IS REALLY ONLY THIS TIME OF YEAR. WHEN THEY'RE FRESH OUT OF HIBERNATION, THEY'RE DESPERATELY TRYING TO GET FOOD, SO THEY SWIM ACROSS HERE. YOU DO NOT WANT A BEAR STUCK ON THE ISLAND. IT'S OUR BACKYARD. BEARS ARE PRETTY SMART, AND THEY FIGURE OUT HOW TO OPEN UP THE DOOR HANDLE. DON'T SAY THAT. I THINK THAT DOOR SHOULD CLOSE NOW. TRY IT. SHE SHOULD. **** COME ON, PUP. IN THE CANOE. LET'S GO. UP, UP, UP. LET'S GO. UP, UP. THANK GOD THEY MADE IT. DID YOU EVER SEE HIM? NO, I DIDN'T SEE HIM, BUT I HEARD IT ON THE RADIO. ALL PERSONS, INCLUDING THE CREW, ARE EVACUATED OFF THE ISLAND, HALTING PRODUCTION FOR SEVERAL HOURS. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION IS UP HERE AND THEY APPEAR TO HAVE MAYBE SPOTTED THE BEAR. BUT WHAT THEY'RE PLANNING ON DOING IS FLUSHING THE BEAR OFF THE ISLAND. IF THAT ALL GOES WELL, THEN WE'LL BE HAPPY, AND WE'LL BE ABLE TO RESUME SHOOTING WITHOUT HAVING THE WORRY OF BEING MAULED BY A BEAR. YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY, TRY TO GET YOURSELF TO SAFETY, BUT WE DON'T WANT TO RUN. RUNNING IS POTENTIALLY GONNA TRIGGER SOME PREDATORY INSTINCT IN THE BEAR. YOU DON'T NECESSARILY WANT TO BE SCREAMING. YOU WANT TO BE MAINTAINING A CALM, CONFIDENT VOICE. BACK AWAY FROM THE BEAR AND THEN SLOWLY GET YOURSELF TO SOMEWHERE SAFE, SUCH AS A BOAT OR ON THE BARGE THERE BY THE HOUSEBOATS. PEOPLE HERE... THAT'S WHAT THEY HAVE TO DEAL WITH. BEARS SWIM. THEY SWIM VERY, VERY WELL. THEY SWAM TO THE ISLAND THAT IS THEIR MAIN PLACE WHERE THEY GO EAT AND WHERE THEY WALK THEIR DOGS AND WHERE THEY TRAVEL UP AND DOWN THE ISLAND TO GET TO ONE ANOTHER. AND SO NOW THIS REAL-LIFE SITUATION IS UNFOLDING, AND IT'S REALLY... IT'S DANGEROUS. IT'S DANGEROUS FOR THE HOUSEBOATERS, AND IT'S DANGEROUS FOR OUR CREW. SO WE HAVE TO BE REALLY, REALLY CAREFUL AND PROTECT OURSELVES AND BE SAFE. THE BEAR WAS EVENTUALLY FLUSHED OUT, SWIMMING TO AN UNINHABITED PART OF THE LAKE. JUST ANOTHER DAY IN YELLOWKNIFE. THE ENGINE DIED AGAIN. IT'S "GREAT SLAVE LAKE" FOR A REASON. I SAY YOU SWIM FOR IT. THE WATER'S ONLY 10 DEGREES CELSIUS. LIVING ON GREAT SLAVE LAKE... GUYS, THERE'S A BEAR ON THE ISLAND. ...IS A NEVER-ENDING BATTLE AGAINST MOTHER NATURE. MEDIC! AND AS THE CREW FILMED THE GREAT SLAVE LAKE REBELS' STRUGGLE TO SURVIVE... **** ...THEY OFTEN FOUND THEMSELVES IN THE GRIPS OF DANGER. WHOO! BUT, TODAY, AS SPRING SUNSHINE ALLOWS HOUSEBOATERS TO ENJOY THE LAKE'S PRISTINE WATERS, OVER IN YELLOWKNIFE BAY, IT'S THE LAST DAY OF SHOOTING FOR THE FIRST SEASON OF "ICE LAKE REBELS." AND "PIKE" MIKE HARRISON HAS INVITED THE COMMUNITY OVER TO HIS NEW SPOT ON DOG ISLAND FOR A HOUSEBOAT-WARMING CELEBRATION. HEY, MIKE. WE'RE A TIGHT COMMUNITY, BUT EVERYBODY LIVES OUT HERE BECAUSE THEY WANT TO BE LEFT ALONE FOR THE MOST PART. BUT IT'S ALWAYS NICE WHEN WE GET TOGETHER AND ENJOY SOME GOOD CONVERSATION, SOME GOOD FOOD, AND THESE FEW MONTHS OF SUMMER. IT'S A NICE REMINDER, AFTER A LONG, COLD WINTER, OF WHY WE DO THIS, WHY WE LIVE ON THE LAKE. THE REBELS ALSO BROUGHT MIKE A FEW HOUSEBOAT-WARMING GIFTS TO HELP HIM SURVIVE WHATEVER THE LAKE THROWS HIS WAY AT HIS NEW LOCATION. CHECK IT OUT, BOSS. RIGHT ON! A BACKUP ANCHOR. I'M TELLING YOU, BRO! RIGHT? YOU KNOW WHAT I NEED. YEAH, REAL GOOD MAN. THAT THING WILL DIG IN LIKE A LINESMAN FOR THE NFL. AND THE MOST IMPORTANT PART, SO YOU KNOW IT'S LEGITIMATE... CHECK IT OUT. "MADE IN CANADA." DUDE, THIS IS REAL STEEL. I GOT IT. THANK YOU. THANKS. YOU'RE WELCOME, BROTHER. THAT'S A REAL GOOD PIECE OF EQUIPMENT. HEY, I BROUGHT YOU A COUPLE OF GIFTS. YOU'RE GONNA FREEZE IN THIS WINTER, SO YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOMETHING TO SWEEP YOUR DECKS AND BREAK YOUR ICE. THAT MOP'S REAL HANDY. THAT'S GOOD FOR THE BOAT. AND THAT'S A DARN-GOOD NEEDLEBAR. IT'S A GOOD NEEDLEBAR, YEAH. IT'LL BREAK THE ICE AWAY FROM YOUR BOAT. NOW, A LOT OF FOLKS DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE A NEEDLEBAR, BUT I CAN CHISEL OUT A HOLE IN FOUR FEET OF ICE IN HALF AN HOUR WITH A NEEDLEBAR. YOU BETCHA. THANK YOU, MAN. YOU'LL PROBABLY NEED IT THERE THIS WINTER, THIS FALL THERE. I'M SURE ABOUT IT. HEY, MIKE, I BROUGHT YOU A PRESENT, BUT I'M NOT BRINGING IT DOWN THERE. THIS IS IN CASE YOU SINK. BOY! WELL, I SAY! GOOD. REAL GOOD. THERE YOU GO. SOMETHING TO KEEP YOU AFLOAT. REAL, REAL, REAL GOOD PIECE OF EQUIPMENT THERE, MOLLY. THANK YOU. THANKS FOR THE FISH, MIKE. IT'S AWESOME. YOU'RE WELCOME. AND CUT. WE'RE WRAPPED. THANK YOU, GUYS, SO MUCH! WHOO-HOO-HOO! YOU'RE AWAY FROM YOUR FAMILY FOR MONTHS, WORKING WITH PEOPLE THAT YOU'VE JUST MET. AND TO BRING YOUR PROFESSIONAL GAME EVERY SINGLE DAY IS ONE THING, BUT TO DO IT IN THESE EXTREME CONDITIONS? YOU COULDN'T ASK FOR MORE. THANK YOU TO KATHRYN! LIVING ON A HOUSEBOAT IS A VERY DANGEROUS LIFE. AND WE ALL KNOW THAT. BUT WHAT MAKES IT WORTH IT IS HAVING FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS WHO GOT YOUR BACK. AS PIKE MIKE'S PARTY WINDS DOWN, THE CREW CUTS CAMERAS AND HEADS BACK TO YELLOWKNIFE. BUT EVEN ON THE LAST DAY, GREAT SLAVE LAKE STILL HAS A FEW MORE SURPRISES UP ITS SLEEVE. THIS IS A WRAP ON SEASON ONE. WE JUST DID OUR LAST SHOT. AND NOW WE CAN'T GET OUT OF HERE BECAUSE... THE ENGINE DIED AGAIN. IT'S "GREAT SLAVE LAKE" FOR A REASON. HELP! IT'S SO FRUSTRATING. WITH THE ENGINE NOT COOPERATING, THE CREW CONSIDERS OTHER WAYS TO REACH CIVILIZATION. I SAY YOU SWIM FOR IT. THE WATER'S ONLY 10 DEGREES CELSIUS. SMART IDEA, ARI. SMART IDEA. I'LL GET US HOME. ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO. ARE WE PADDLING FOR IT? ARE WE SERIOUSLY PADDLING TO SHORE? ALL RIGHT, SO, WHICH DIRECTION ARE WE PADDLING? THAT WAY. ALL RIGHT. THIS IS SILLY. WHY DON'T WE MAKE IT TO RANDY'S HOUSE? HERE WE GO. HERE WE GO. THIS IS... WE GOT A PLAN. RANDY WILL SAVE US. PAN OVER TO RANDY'S HOUSE. HEY, RANDY. YOU'RE THERE, RIGHT? RANDY! SAVE US! SEE? LOOK. I ALMOST GOT IT GOING. - MICHAEL? - YES? PICK UP A PADDLE. STOP RECORDING AND PICK UP A PADDLE.
