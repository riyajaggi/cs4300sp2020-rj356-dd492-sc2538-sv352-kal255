 ON THE SUBARCTIC SHORES OF GREAT SLAVE LAKE... 42 REBELS HAVE LAID CLAIM TO FREEDOM, LIVING OFFSHORE, BEYOND THE REACH OF GOVERNMENT CONTROL. THOSE OF US WHO LIVE ON THE BAY, WE JUST LIKE BEING ON OUR OWN AND JUST BEING FREE. I WOULDN'T TRADE THIS WAY OF LIFE FOR ANYTHING. I LOVE IT. FOR THE PAST SIX MONTHS, THE LAKE HAS BEEN BURIED UNDER SIX FEET OF ICE. LIVING ON A HOUSEBOAT AND THE LAKE'S FROZEN SOLID IS KIND OF A CONVENIENT THING

 BECAUSE YOU CAN DRIVE RIGHT UP TO YOUR HOUSEBOAT. BUT NOW, AS TEMPERATURES RISE, THE FROZEN SURFACE BENEATH THEIR FEET IS CHANGING. HEY, STEPH. I WAS HEARING CRACKING. THE ICE IS GETTING PRETTY BAD ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE BAY, HERE. WE'VE PROBABLY ONLY GOT 24 HOURS, AND IT'S GONNA START GETTING UNSAFE. HOUSEBOATERS MUST TAKE EXTREME CAUTION, OR THEIR NEXT STEP COULD BE THEIR LAST. AAH! WHEN IT COMES TO BREAK-UP, YOU HAVE TO BE READY TO PAY THE PRICE. ON A HOUSEBOAT, THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS THAT CAN GO WRONG.

 MISTAKES CAN COST YOU YOUR LIFE. GEEZ! EARLY SPRING'S RISING TEMPERATURES AND CHANGING ICE SIGNAL THE MOST DANGEROUS TIME OF THE YEAR FOR THE HOUSEBOATERS OF YELLOWKNIFE BAY. GREAT SLAVE LAKE IS IN THE EARLY STAGES OF BREAK-UP. HOUSEBOATERS ARE STILL CROSSING THE ICE ON FOOT AND SNOWMOBILE, BUT THE WINDOW FOR SAFE PASSAGE IS RAPIDLY CLOSING. THIS IS THE MOST DANGEROUS TIME. IF YOU'RE NOT SMART, AND YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL, AND YOU DON'T RESPECT THE LAKE, YOU'RE IN A DANGEROUS POSITION, MY FRIEND, AND YOU COULD DIE. THERE'S SOMETHING UNSETTLING ABOUT KNOWING THAT THE GROUND UNDERNEATH YOU COULD COLLAPSE TO POTENTIAL DEATH AT ANY MOMENT. PREPARATION IS CRUCIAL, AND TIME'S RUNNING OUT AS THE REBELS GET READY FOR THE BIG THAW. WE'RE PREPARING. YOU GOT STUFF TO TAKE CARE OF. IT'S DANGEROUS, BUT IT'S PART OF LIVING ON THE LAKE. YOU HAVE TO EMBRACE IT, AND I LOVE IT. IT'S THE PRICE YOU PAY TO BE ABLE TO ENJOY THE SUMMER COMING. I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT THE CANOE CAN GO IN THE WATER AND MOVE. AND BREAK-UP IS JUST ONE STEP UNTIL THEN. AS THE FOUNDING FATHER OF THE HOUSEBOATERS, GARY VAILLANCOURT TAKES THE SAFETY OF HIS NEIGHBORS SERIOUSLY. WITH TEMPERATURES RISING AND THE ICE CHANGING BY THE HOUR, IT'S TIME TO DISCUSS PREPARATIONS FOR SURVIVING BREAK-UP. SPRING HERE HAS BEEN VERY SLOW. WE'VE GOT THICK, THICK ICE HERE IN PLACES. OTHER PLACES, WE'VE GOT NO ICE AT ALL. I'VE NEVER QUITE SEEN IT LIKE THIS. HI, EVERYBODY. I'M GLAD YOU COULD ALL MAKE IT. I THOUGHT, BECAUSE THE ICE CONDITIONS WERE SO WEIRD THIS YEAR AND BREAK-UP WAS NOT LIKE ANY BREAK-UP I'VE SEEN IN A WHILE, THAT WE'D ALL GET TOGETHER AND KIND OF TALK ABOUT THE CONDITION OF THE ICE. IT'S DIFFERENT THIS YEAR, SO WE SHOULD MAYBE BE A LITTLE EXTRA CAREFUL. SO, WHAT'S THE ICE LIKE AROUND YOUR HOUSE, MIKE? THE WAY IT LOOKS, IF CONDITIONS STAY THE SAME, I FIGURE I'M FLOATING IN THREE DAYS. I'M A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED ABOUT, YOU KNOW, A BIG SOUTH WIND BLOWING IN ICE. AND THAT'S A REALLY VALID CONCERN. ONE THING ABOUT THE ICE IS WHEN IT DOES PUSH IN HERE, IT WILL BEND STEEL. THERE WAS THAT ONE HUGE PAN OF ICE IN BACK BAY, AND IT CAME LOOSE, AND IT ABSOLUTELY TWISTED THE FRAME ON MY BOAT AND JUST PUSHED THE FLOATS RIGHT UNDERNEATH. AND, YOU KNOW, IT DIDN'T SINK THE BOAT, BUT IT DAMAGED IT PRETTY BAD. I HEARD A LOUD BANG, AND I COULD FEEL IT VIBRATE THROUGH THE FRAME. AND I WENT OUTSIDE, AND I LOOKED, AND I REALIZED WHAT WAS GOING ON, AND THERE WASN'T A HELL OF A LOT I COULD DO ABOUT IT, EITHER. IT WAS LIKE WATCHING A CAR WRECK IN SLOW MOTION. LAST NIGHT WHEN I WAS COMING HOME, ALLYCE SAID, "DO NOT USE THE PATIO-DOOR ENTRANCE. IT IS OUT OF COMMISSION." SO, WE HAVE THESE TWO RANDOM HOLES BETWEEN US AND THE FAR SHORE. IT'S ALREADY GETTING SKETCHY BETWEEN THEM, AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH THE LENGTH OF OUR HOUSE. SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE THAT AREA WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO REALLY WATCH OUT FOR THIS YEAR. THE LAKE IS ALWAYS ALIVE. EVEN WHEN THERE'S SIX FEET OF ICE, THERE'S STILL A BIT OF WATER AT THE BOTTOM THAT'S ALWAYS MOVING. IT'S ALWAYS CHANGING. AND WHEN IT GETS TO BREAK-UP, IT REALLY BECOMES NOTICEABLE. WHEN IT STARTS GETTING DARK ALL OVER, NOW WE'RE GETTING TO THAT POINT WHERE YOU GOT TO REALLY BE CAREFUL. THIN ICE APPEARS BLACK AS THE WEAKENED PATCHES REFLECT LESS LIGHT THAN THICK ICE. A MISPLACED FOOT CAN SEND YOU INTO THE FRIGID WATER BELOW. IT WAS TERRIFYING COMING HOME LAST NIGHT. IT WAS SO SLIPPERY AND SO RAINY AND WET. AND I'M THINKING, LIKE, WHEN YOU'RE GOING AROUND BY MATTHEW'S HOUSE, WHERE THE CHANNEL IS, KIND OF LIKE, "IS THE ICE GONNA GIVE OUT? AND, IF SO, IF I SCREAM, NOBODY'S GONNA HEAR ME." I WOULD HEAR YOU. IT SOUNDS LIKE WE'VE ALL GOT LONG LISTS AND NOT A LOT OF TIME TO TAKE CARE OF BUSINESS. SO, I MEAN, IF WE CAN HELP EACH OTHER OUT, WHY NOT? WE HAVE A GOOD COMMUNITY OF HOUSEBOATERS OUT HERE. WE WILL ALL HELP EACH OTHER OUT, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO FREEZE-UP AND BREAK-UP. IF YOU NEED SOMETHING, SOMEONE WILL HELP YOU. THIS IS MOLLY MacKINNON'S FIRST BREAK-UP ON THE LAKE SINCE CHILDHOOD. NOW FATHER GARY SHARES HIS 30 YEARS' EXPERIENCE IN READING THE ICE'S WARNING SIGNS. SEE ALL THE PATTERNS IN THERE? YEAH. THAT'S ALL THE BEGINNING OF THE ICE CANDLES THAT, FOR SOME REASON, IT FREEZES IN A CERTAIN WAY AND IN THE SPRING IT'S NOT ALL PURE ICE CRYSTAL. THERE'S LINES IN IT. SO WHEN THE SNOW MELTS AND THERE'S WATER, IT FLOWS INTO THESE LITTLE CRACKS. AND THE WATER GOES DOWN, AND AFTER A WHILE IT'LL MELT RIGHT THROUGH AND MAKE CANDLES. SO THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF A CANDLING OF ICE. I'M RE-LEARNING HOW TO SURVIVE IN THE NORTH, AND I FEEL LIKE IT'S AN ON-GOING LEARNING CURVE. WHEN YOU WALK ON THEM AND HEAR THEM GO I DON'T WANT THEM TO DO THAT. AND WHEN YOU HEAR, YOU SHOULDN'T BE THERE. WITH BREAK-UP FAST APPROACHING, FISH PLANT CO-OWNER BRIAN ABBOTT MUST HAUL IN AS MANY FISH AS HE CAN BEFORE THE LAKE BREAKS APART IN ICY SHEETS TOO TREACHEROUS TO WALK, DRIVE, OR SAIL ON. TODAY, I'M GONNA PULL THE NETS OUT. THIS'LL BE THE LAST DAY. OOH. THE ICE IS GETTING PRETTY BAD ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE BAY, HERE. THAT'S THE END OF OUR ICE. IT'S RIGHT THROUGH HERE. SO WHAT HAVE I GOT LEFT? THREE FEET OF CANDLE ICE. WE'VE PROBABLY ONLY GOT 24, 36 HOURS, AND IT'S GONNA START GETTING UNSAFE. I'M HOPING THIS'LL BE A BIG HAUL, 'CAUSE THIS IS THE LAST RUN FOR THE SEASON. WE NEED MORE FISH IN THE FREEZERS. IN WINTER, THE ICE ON THE OPEN LAKE IS SIX FEET THICK, CAPABLE OF BEARING THE WEIGHT OF A 68-TON MILITARY TANK. NOW, BRIAN MAKES A 30-MILE SNOWMOBILE JOURNEY ACROSS UNPREDICTABLE ICE TO PULL HIS FINAL NET OF THE WINTER. AND WHILE BRIAN NORMALLY WORKS WITH A PARTNER, HE PREFERS TO TAKE THE RISK OF BEING ON A THAWING LAKE ALONE. GOT TO BE VERY CAREFUL ON MY WAY OUT TO THE NET LINE. IF I HAPPEN TO BREAK THROUGH THE ICE, THERE'S NOBODY OUT THERE TO SAVE ME. SO, THE LAST FEW DAYS, I DON'T TAKE ANYBODY OUT BECAUSE I THINK IT'S JUST TOO DANGEROUS TO BE BRINGING SOMEBODY ELSE WITH ME. I'LL BE PRAYING THAT I DON'T END UP UNDERWATER. ON THE WESTERN SHORES OF YELLOWKNIFE BAY... IT'S GO TIME, BABY. LET'S GO. ...TODAY STEPHAN ENLISTS HIS BEST FRIEND, RYAN, TO HELP MAKE A NEW MOORING, OR ANCHOR, FOR HIS HOUSEBOAT AFTER HIS WAS CRUSHED BY ICE LAST YEAR. LOOK AT THAT FRICKING RAIN, BUD. HERE'S MOORING 101... MOORING IS A LINE TIED TO YOUR VESSEL, AND AN ANCHOR TIED TO THAT LINE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE LAKE. IT'S WHAT HOLDS YOU IN PLACE. IT IS YOUR LIFELINE. THEY'RE USING RE-PURPOSED GRATER BLADES THAT MUST BE HAULED ACROSS THE LAKE TODAY, BEFORE THE ICE BECOMES TOO WEAK TO BEAR THEIR 1,200-POUND WEIGHT. SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK? YOU THINK THEY'RE 100 POUNDS OR 75 POUNDS EACH? ABOUT 100 POUNDS. ABOUT 100 POUNDS? YEP. OKAY, THEN I DON'T WANT TO TAKE MORE THAN MAYBE FOUR. YEAH, WE'LL DO FOUR. THE REASON WHY WE'RE DOING IT AT THIS TIME OF THE YEAR IS BECAUSE WE CAN GET IT POSITIONED PROPERLY. IF WE DID THIS IN THE SUMMER, IT'D BE A LOT GRATER CHALLENGE. YOU WOULD NEED BOATS WITH PLANKS IN BETWEEN THEM, AND YOU'D BE BUILDING IT ON THOSE PLANKS. AND THAT IS A LOT MORE DANGEROUS THAN THIS. I GET HIT EVERY SPRING BY THE ICE COMING IN IN MEGA-SHEETS, HUNDREDS OF TONS. TWO YEARS AGO, MY HOUSEBOAT WAS MOVED BY ABOUT 15 TO 20 YARDS. I ENDED UP ON MY NEIGHBOR'S DOORSTEP. FOUR BLADES, 400 POUNDS. 150, 150. THAT'S 600 POUNDS WE'RE MOVING ON THIS ICE. THAT'S 700. 700 POUNDS WE'RE MOVING ON THIS ICE. YEAH, THAT'S THE MAX LOAD. I DON'T WANT TO TAKE ANYTHING MORE THAN THAT. EVEN THEN I'M... MAYBE PUSHING IT A BIT. THERE'S NO WAY I'M TAKING 1,200 POUNDS IN A CANOE, ON TOP OF ME AND RYAN'S BODY WEIGHT, ACROSS. THAT WOULDN'T BE SAFE. RYAN, JUST FOR SAFETY REASONS, I SUGGEST I'LL WALK A COUPLE OF METERS IN FRONT OF THE BOAT, YOU WALK A COUPLE OF METERS BEHIND THE BOAT. SO WE'RE SPREADING THAT 700 POUNDS ON THE ICE SO WE'RE NOT GONNA COLLAPSE. WELL, LET'S GET YOU SOME MOMENTUM FIRST. 10-4. LET'S DO IT. HOLD ON. SO, WE DECIDED THAT SAFEST PATH WAS TO BREAK THIS INTO THREE, 700-POUNDS AT A TIME INCLUDING OUR BODY WEIGHT. THIS IS SKETCHY ICE. IT'S AMAZING TO THINK THAT A SHORT TIME AGO PEOPLE WERE DRIVING TRUCKS AND CARS ALL OVER THIS LAKE, AND TODAY WE CAN'T EVEN CARRY 400 POUNDS ON THE ICE WITHOUT BEING DANGEROUS. SEE HOW THAT ALL OPENED UP OVERNIGHT, RYAN? YEAH, I SEE THAT, MAN. WHEN YOU'RE WALKING ON THE ICE AT THIS TIME OF THE YEAR, YOU GOT TO WATCH YOUR STEP BECAUSE YOU STEP IN A SNAKE HOLE. A SNAKE HOLE... BASICALLY A HOLE THAT'S BEEN FORMED BY A SWIRL OR CURRENT BECAUSE THE LAKE NEVER CEASES TO MOVE UNDERNEATH THAT SOLID ICE. IT MELTS ONE PERFECT LITTLE HOLE, JUST ENOUGH FOR YOUR LEG TO FALL THROUGH. I HEARD SOME CRACKS AS WE WERE COMING ACROSS THERE. YEAH, THERE'S A COUPLE. THINK WE SHOULD TAKE ANOTHER PATH THE NEXT TIME? YEAH, IT'S DANGEROUS OUT HERE, MAN. THAT RAIN CHANGED EVERYTHING OVERNIGHT. THAT WOULD BE A SAFE THING TO DO. THE SUN'S BREAKING FREE. THAT MEANS WE GOT LESS TIME. LET'S GET ON THIS. WISH YOU WERE BETTER AT MATH. YEAH, WELL, THAT'S WHY I GOT YOU? YOU'RE THE BRAINS OF THIS OPERATION. I'LL JUST BE... WHOA! SNAKE HOLE. RIGHT HERE. ALL THE WAY THROUGH. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS? THIS IS GONNA MELT FAST. YEAH. WELL, LET'S GET A MOVE ON, MAN. WE GOT TO GET THIS TOGETHER BEFORE IT MELTS THROUGH. ON YOUR MARK. SO, THE FIRST TIME WE CAME OVER TO THE HOUSEBOAT WITH ALL THAT WEIGHT, RYAN HEARD THE CRACKING AND SO DID I. SO WE KNEW WE HAD TO TAKE A DIFFERENT PATH EVERY TIME. YOU GOOD, RYAN? RYAN? CAREFUL. HEY, STEPH, I WAS HEARING CRACKING. HEY, STEPH... IN YELLOWKNIFE BAY, GREAT SLAVE LAKE IS IN THE BEGINNING PHASES OF AWAKENING FROM A LONG WINTER SLUMBER. - READY? - YEAH. ON YOUR MARK. AND STEPHAN MUST SECURE HIS HOUSEBOAT WITH A NEW MOORING BEFORE BREAK-UP. YOU GOOD, RYAN? THE LAKE IS MELTING FROM SHORE TO SHORE. THE CANDLE ICE BEGINS ON THE TOP. IT'S WET, IT'S SLOPPY, AND IT'S DANGEROUS. RYAN? CAREFUL. I CAN HEAR THE ICE CRACKING BENEATH US. BUT CARRYING 600 POUNDS OF METAL ACROSS UNSTABLE ICE IS RISKY BUSINESS. HEY, STEPH. YEAH? YOU SHOULD PROBABLY TAKE A NEW ROUTE? I WAS HEARING CRACKING. THAT'S PROBABLY A GOOD IDEA. SO NOW YOU'RE LITERALLY WALKING ON GLASS. THE SOLID GROUND THAT WAS UNDER YOUR FEET FOR SEVEN MONTHS IS NOW BECOMING PERILOUS. OKAY. WHAT ARE YOU THINKING? GO AROUND. GO THIS WAY HERE? YEAH. 10-4. THIS IS THE MOST DANGEROUS TIME OF THE YEAR. THERE'S NO ICE YOU CAN TRUST. THE THRILL OF LIVING ON A HOUSEBOAT IS A BALANCE BETWEEN THE GOOD TIMES AND THE DANGEROUS TIMES. WE DID IT. LET'S LOAD. NOW THE REAL WORK BEGINS. SON. YEAH. RYAN'S RIGHT ON IT. HE'S GONNA LINE THEM ALL UP WHILE I START CUTTING SPACERS OUT OF A.B.S. PLASTIC. ONCE STEPHAN AND RYAN CONNECT THE GRATER BLADES INTO A SOLID UNIT, THEY'LL CONNECT IT TO THE HOUSEBOAT WITH A 20-FOOT METAL CHAIN, GIVING STEPHAN A 1,200-POUND ANCHOR TO SECURE HIS HOME FROM THE ONSLAUGHT OF BREAK-UP'S RUNAWAY ICE SHEETS. BEAUTIFUL. GOOD JOB, MAN. THANKS, DUDE. SO, WE'VE GOT 12 GRATER BLADES AND 3 REDI-RODS AT A 3-FOOT LENGTH. LET'S PUT THAT REDI-ROD THROUGH. SPACERS. ROCK 'N' ROLL, BOY. WE STAND UP THE MOORING... ON THREE. ONE, TWO, THREE. HOLY **** ...BECAUSE WE GOT TO PULL THAT REDI-ROD NICE AND TIGHT SO THAT WE CAN TIGHTEN IT UP WITH THE NUTS... YOU KNOW, SHE'S A LITTLE DIRTY. YOU SHOULD WASH HER. ...SO WE HAVE A SECURE MOORING. SO, NOW WE'VE GOT TO LAY THIS 1,200-POUND MOORING DOWN. JUST WANT TO LET IT DROP? YEAH, LET'S... LET'S JUST LET IT GO, MAN. LET'S DROP THIS. NO. THIS IS 1,200 POUNDS. IF WE CAN EASE IT AS FAR AS WE CAN HANDLE IT THEN LET IT GO, THAT'D BE BETTER. OKAY. IF IT BREAKS THROUGH THE ICE, WE GO THAT WAY, 'CAUSE I KNOW THAT ICE IS SAFER. 'CAUSE WE'RE SENDING ALL THE WEIGHT THAT WAY, WE'RE GOING THE OPPOSITE WAY. IT'S SCIENCE. THIS IS THE MOST DANGEROUS PART OF THE WHOLE... IT IS. YOU COUNT IT DOWN, BUD. IT'S ON THREE, SO I'M GONNA GO, "ONE, TWO, DROP." NOT, "ONE, TWO, THREE, GO." OKAY. LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE DIED NOT KNOWING THESE THINGS. READY? ON THREE. ONE, TWO, THREE. DROP IT NOW. WE'RE GOOD. SAFE. WHAT NOW? GOOD JOB. LET'S GO GET THE CHAIN AND THE ROPE. SO, NOW WE GOT TO SECURE THE CHAIN TO THE MOORING... ...PUT A CLASP ON THAT CHAIN, THEN RUN OUR 3/4-INCH NYLON ROPE ALL THE WAY TO THE CLEAT ON THE HOUSEBOAT TO SECURE THIS MOORING. NOW ALL WE GOT TO DO IS WAIT FOR THAT MOORING TO MELT THROUGH THE ICE, AND THAT COULD HAPPEN AT ANY TIME. WE GOT 1,200 POUNDS OF MOORING HERE. ALLYCE IS GONNA BE PROUD OF US, MAN. IN EARLY SPRING, ICE MELTS MOST QUICKLY ALONG THE SHORELINES OF YELLOWKNIFE BAY, LEAVING RANDY SIBBESTON'S HOME ALREADY PARTIALLY SUBMERGED. WITH TEMPERATURES WARMING INTO THE HIGH TEENS, RANDY HAS ONLY DAYS TO MAKE SURE HIS HOUSEBOAT WILL STAY AFLOAT WHEN THE ICE FINALLY BREAKS APART. IF YOU'RE MAINTENANCE IS NOT DONE, YOU KNOW, YOUR FLOATS AREN'T PUMPED OUT AND YOU'RE NOT TIED UP PROPERLY, YOU'RE JUST ASKING FOR TROUBLE. DURING BREAK-UP, RANDY'S FLOATS ARE THE FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE AGAINST THE LAKE'S CRUSHING ICE. LAST YEAR, I HAD SOME PRETTY SEVERE ICE DAMAGE, AND I HAVE TO KEEP AN EYE ON THIS FLOAT NOW. THIS IS THE CRACK THAT IT DEVELOPED LAST WINTER. SEE IT'S A PRETTY SEVERE CRACK, HERE. IT GOES RIGHT DOWN. IT WOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM, BUT IT JUST GOES JUST BELOW THE WATERLINE. YOU CAN SEE THE WATER. THE WATERLINE'S RIGHT HERE... AND IF YOU FOLLOW IT ALONG, THE END OF THIS CRACK IS JUST UNDERNEATH THE WATERLINE. THE BRUTAL WINTER THAT WE HAD, IT WAS SO COLD OUT, AND I JUST THOUGHT THAT, YOU KNOW, THE PLASTIC GETS BRITTLE IN THOSE TEMPERATURES. SO I WAS A LITTLE WORRIED ABOUT THOSE CRACKS SPREADING AND GETTING BIGGER AND BIGGER. IF THAT HAPPENS, THEN THIS PONTOON IS JUST GONNA KEEP FILLING UP WITH WATER. SINCE PONTOONS ARE A HOUSEBOAT'S FOUNDATION, A SINKING ONE WILL MEAN A DISASTROUS END TO HIS FAMILY'S HOME. I'M GONNA TRY TO BUILD A SET OF FLOATS THAT IS GONNA BE COST-EFFECTIVE, DURABLE, AND JUST CAREFULLY DESIGNED SO THAT IT CAN STAND UP TO THE CONDITIONS IN THE BAY. WITHIN DAYS, THE WEAK, CANDLING ICE WILL BECOME TOO THIN TO CROSS SAFELY ON FOOT, YET NOT MELTED ENOUGH FOR CANOE PASSAGE. THE HOUSE BOATERS MUST BE PREPARED WITH ALL THE SUPPLIES THEY NEED TO SURVIVE SEVERAL WEEKS STUCK INSIDE. AND MOLLY, OWNER OF THE LAKE'S ONLY BISTRO BOAT, IS NEARLY OUT OF FISH. SO, AS YOU CAN SEE, I'M COMPLETELY OUT OF FISH, AND I HAVE TO STOCK UP FOR THE RESTAURANT. I GOT TO GO WALK ACROSS THAT ICE, AND I'M REALLY NERVOUS ABOUT IT. SHE MUST MAKE THE TREK ACROSS THE SEMI-FROZEN BAY TO THE FISH PLANT NOW IN ORDER TO STOCK HER FREEZERS. THE OTHER DAY, THERE WAS SOMEONE WHO HAD FALLEN THROUGH IN FRONT OF OUR HOUSE, AND MY DAD RAN OUT WITH A PLANK TO, LIKE, SAVE HIM. AND HE WAS REALLY LUCKY, 'CAUSE NO ONE'S GONNA SAVE YOU IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT LAKE. I'M BRINGING MY CANOE TO GET OVER TO THE FISH PLANT, AND I'M GONNA TRY SOME CANOE BREAK-UP TECHNIQUES. I'M GONNA PUSH THE CANOE AND KIND OF LIKE RUN BEHIND IT A LITTLE BIT AND PUT MY WEIGHT ON THE BACK OF IT SO THAT IF GO THROUGH, I CAN JUST PUT MY FEET IN THE CANOE, AND I'M NOT GONNA BE IN THE WATER. IN CHOOSING THE SAFEST ROUTE ACROSS THE BAY, MOLLY MUST LOOK FOR WHITE PATCHES INDICATING SOLID ICE AND STEER CLEAR OF DARK OR CANDLED SPOTS WHICH COULD SEND HER INTO THE ICY WATERS BELOW. - HEY. - HI. I WAS HOPING TO GET SOME FISH TODAY, IF YOU HAD ANYTHING. HOW MUCH WOULD YOU NEED? UM, I WAS THINKING, LIKE, 17 FILLETS. WHEN I SHOWED UP TO GET SOME FISH, HENRY WAS SURPRISED TO SEE ME ON THAT ICE. HOW DID YOU MANAGE TO GET OVER HERE? DID YOU WALK ON THE ICE, OR DID YOU COME ACROSS THE ISLAND? I WENT ON THE ICE. I TOOK THE CANOE. I WON'T DO THAT. AND THAT MADE ME REALLY NERVOUS TO GO BACK. THE ICE GETS SOFT AND THEN YOU CAN ACTUALLY GO THROUGH IT. ONCE THE ICE CANDELIZES, IT'S EASY TO GO THROUGH. NOT A GOOD FEELING, GOING THROUGH. SO, ANYHOW, I'M GLAD I WAS ABLE TO HELP YOU WITH THE FISH. AND IF YOU NEED ANY MORE, YOU SHOULD COME BY AND SEE ME. THANK YOU. AND IN THE MEANTIME, THAT ICE IS... PRETTY SCARY. I DON'T KNOW IF I'D BE GOING BACK ON THAT ICE ANYMORE AFTER TODAY. THIS WILL DEFINITELY BE THE LAST TRIP. I'M GLAD I COULD FILL MY FREEZER. THANK YOU. OKAY, THAT'S GOOD. YOU HAVE YOURSELF A NICE DAY. I'M GLAD I WAS ABLE TO HELP YOU. THE ICE STARTED GIVING OUT UNDER MY FEET. I DON'T THINK I PICKED AS GOOD A ROUTE AS I HAD ON THE WAY THERE. I STARTED FALLING THROUGH THE ICE A LITTLE BIT. MY FEET STARTED SINKING IN, AND I JUST HAD TO, LIKE, BOOK IT. I WAS GOING IN IF I DIDN'T KEEP ON MOVING. THAT IS MY TECHNIQUE... TO MOVE AS FAST AS POSSIBLE, AND I DEFINITELY HIT MYSELF ON THE CANOE SO MANY TIMES. I'M JUST COVERED IN BRUISES. IT WAS NOT A GOOD TECHNIQUE. WHEN I GOT BACK FROM THE FISH PLANT, I MADE UP MY MIND... I AM NOT GOING BACK ON THAT ICE. SO, LIKE, YOU'RE ACTUALLY BREAKING THROUGH IT? LIKE, MY WHOLE LEG'S GOING IN ON EITHER SIDE. IT'S REALLY UNSETTLING. AS CONDITIONS ON THE BAY CONTINUE TO DETERIORATE UNDER THE HOT SUN, FISHERMAN BRIAN RISKS A 35-MILE SNOWMOBILE TREK ALONE ACROSS UNPREDICTABLE ICE IN ORDER TO BRING IN THE LAST NETS OF THE SEASON AND KEEP HIS CUSTOMERS FED THROUGH BREAK-UP. IT'S A LITTLE SCARY BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE ANYONE TO HELP ME IF I HAVE A PROBLEM. BUT I'M PRETTY SELF-SUFFICIENT, SO I THINK I CAN MANAGE. BE MY LAST DAY HERE. TIME TO START PULLING THEM OUT. GONNA HURT. I NEED MORE FISH, BUT... IT IS WHAT IT IS. I GUESS I CAN'T COMPLAIN. THE SEASON'S LASTED LONGER THIS YEAR THAN USUAL, SO. WE GOT FISH ON. IT'S QUITE DANGEROUS THIS TIME OF YEAR IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING. SO PART OF BEING SAFE OUT HERE IS KNOWING THE ICE. SO, I GOT LOTS OF WATER AROUND THE HOLES, OF COURSE GETTING THE ICE ALL WET AND MELTING IT AROUND THE HOLE MUCH QUICKER. WHOA! ACROSS CANADA'S GREAT SLAVE LAKE, WHERE SPRING'S THAW WILL SOON MELT 10,000 SQUARE MILES OF ICE, PROFESSIONAL FISHERMAN BRIAN ABBOTT PULLS HIS FINAL NET OF THE SEASON ALONE. WHOA! YOU'RE OUT THERE, YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN. THERE'S NOBODY COMING TO GET YOU UNTIL YOU LET THEM KNOW THAT YOU'RE STUCK. MOST OF THE TIME YOU'RE OUT OF PHONE SERVICE. I'M HOPING THIS WILL BE A BIG HAUL 'CAUSE THIS IS THE LAST RUN FOR THE SEASON. OUR FREEZERS ARE NOT FULL LIKE I'D HOPED. WE WERE HOPING TO HAVE THEM FULL OF WHITEFISH. NAH. WE HAVE NO WHITEFISH. THIS BEING MY LAST LOAD, IT'S GONNA BE THE LAST FISH I BRING IN FOR THREE TO SIX WEEKS. IT'S GONNA BE THAT LONG BEFORE I FEEL SAFE GOING OUT ON THE LAKE WITH THE BOAT AGAIN. WELL, THE ONE THING OUT HERE, IT'S PEACEFUL AND QUIET. I GOT LOTS OF COMPANY WITH THE SEAGULLS AND THE FISH OUT HERE, BUT NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE TO TALK TO. SO I FIND MYSELF TALKING TO THE BIRDS AND THE FISH. WHY AM I DOING THIS AND NOBODY ELSE IS? I'M NOT SURE. MAYBE I AM NUTS. WHAT THE ICE DOES IS IT MELTS AWAY FROM THE SHORE, AND THE MAIN SHEET OF ICE ON THE LAKE LASTS FOR QUITE SOME TIME. BUT THE ICE BECOMES REALLY UNSAFE. I SURE HOPE WE GOT ENOUGH FISH IN STOCK TO GET US THROUGH THE THAW. WHILE BRIAN RACES THE SUNSET ON HIS THREE-HOUR JOURNEY HOME TO THE FISH PLANT... ...NEAR THE SHORES OF YELLOWKNIFE BAY, RANDY SEARCHES THE LOCAL DUMP FOR METAL DRUMS THAT HE CAN RE-PURPOSE AS PONTOONS TO REPLACE HIS DAMAGED PLASTIC FLOATS. HE STARTS BY COMBING THROUGH THE DISCARDED EQUIPMENT LEFT BEHIND AT THE YELLOWKNIFE WASTE MANAGEMENT CENTER. ALL I'M SEEING HERE ARE REALLY DAMAGED TANKS AND TANKS THAT ARE CUT IN HALF. JUST GO TAKE A QUICK LOOK. THESE 45-GALLON DRUMS, THEY FLOAT, BUT THIS METAL'S A LITTLE BIT THIN AND THEY RUST OUT PRETTY QUICKLY. SO, A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE TRIED USING THEM OVER THE YEARS FOR FLOTATION, BUT THEY JUST DON'T LAST. LOOK AT THIS. IT'S A BEAUTY. NO DENTS, NO RUST. IT'S IN ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC CONDITION. THIS IS JUST A GOOD, SOLID STEEL TANK. THESE ARE 250-GALLON FUEL TANKS, AND THEY'RE GONNA GO TO WASTE SITTING AT THE DUMP. I'M GONNA JUST CHECK AND SEE IF THERE'S ANY FUEL LEFT IN THIS TANK. THE ONLY THING YOU GOT TO WATCH OUT FOR WHEN YOU'RE RECYCLING THESE FUEL TANKS IS THAT THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY EMPTY AND CLEAN WHEN YOU REPURPOSE THEM. YOU DON'T WANT ANY FUEL OR FUEL RESIDUE TO GET INTO THE LAKE. THIS TANK, AT HALFWAY, WILL DISPLACE 125 GALLONS OF WATER. AND WATER'S ABOUT EIGHT POUNDS A GALLON, SO IT'S ABOUT MAYBE 1,000 POUNDS. WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THESE AS WELL IS THAT THEY HAVE A ROUND SIDE. AND IF THEY'RE NOT SUNK TOO FAR DOWN, I'M HOPING THAT THE ICE WILL SLIDE RIGHT UNDERNEATH. NOW THAT I'VE GOT THE FUEL TANK, I'M GOING TO START TO BUILD MY FLOATS. AS THE SUN RISES ON THE SECOND UNSEASONABLY WARM DAY IN A ROW, IN YELLOWKNIFE BAY, WHERE THE ICE IS MELTING EVEN FASTER IN THE SHALLOWS, GARY VAILLANCOURT PREPARES DAUGHTER MOLLY FOR A KEY LESSON ALL HOUSEBOATERS MUST MASTER BEFORE BREAK-UP ARRIVES. EVERYBODY AROUND HERE HAS FALLEN THROUGH THE ICE, RIGHT? YOU HAVEN'T YET. I'M NERVOUS TO. IT'S AN EXPERIENCE. SO WHAT I THOUGHT WE COULD DO IS, WE'RE GONNA GET DRESSED IN ALL THESE DRY SUITS, AND WE'RE GONNA GO OUT AND WALK ON THE ICE. MOST OF THE TIME WHEN WE'RE WALKING, WE STAY AWAY FROM TROUBLE, BUT NOW WE'RE GONNA GO LOOK FOR IT. GOODY. SO, ARE YOU NERVOUS? I'M FREAKING OUT. I'VE NOTICED, SINCE MOLLY'S COME BACK, SHE'S A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED ABOUT WATER AND FALLING THROUGH THE ICE. MOST PEOPLE ARE JUSTIFIABLY AFRAID. I WOULD LIKE HER TO BE COMFORTABLE ON THE ICE. SO THE WAY TO DO THAT IS TO GO PLAY ON THE ICE. WELL, YOU'VE BEEN IN COLD WATER BEFORE, BUT NOT THIS COLD. NOT LIKE THIS. AND NOT WHERE THE ICE, LIKE, GIVES AWAY UNDER YOU. THAT'S A WHOLE NOTHER PARTY. THERE'S NO SAFETY HERE. FALLING IN'S A BIG DEAL. YOU FALL INTO THAT WATER, YOU GOT A PROBLEM. WHAT OTHER PARTS KIND OF MAKE YOU NERVOUS? MOSTLY JUST NOT HAVING ANY ICE UNDERNEATH MY FEET, IT ALL, LIKE, GOING AWAY AND NOT BEING ABLE TO GET OUT AND DIE. BUT JUST THE DYING THING. WE'LL TIE A ROPE ON YOU SO THAT, YOU KNOW, IF YOU FLOAT AWAY, I CAN PULL YOU BACK. ARE YOU GONNA HAVE THE OTHER END OF THE ROPE? I'M GONNA HAVE THE OTHER END OF THE ROPE, AND I'M GONNA HAVE A SUIT ON SO I CAN JUMP IN AND GET YOU. WITH THE LAKE'S WATER TEMPERATURE NEAR FREEZING, GARY AND MOLLY MUST PERFORM THIS TEST WEARING INSULATED DRY SUITS OR RISK SUCCUMBING TO HYPOTHERMIA IN MINUTES. I'VE BEEN IN THE WATER AT THAT TEMPERATURE, AND IT JUST SHOCKS YOU. YOU'RE LIKE, "GET ME OUT." AND IT'S OFTEN HARD TO FIND A WAY TO GET OUT. THAT'S JUST TERRIFYING. OKAY. LET'S GET OUT OF HERE AND GET ON. THE IDEA OF NOT HAVING ANYTHING UNDERNEATH YOU AND THE ICE ALL COLLAPSING AROUND YOU, THIS IS SCARY. IN SUBARCTIC CANADA, BREAK-UP, A PROCESS WHICH CAN TAKE WEEKS TO COMPLETE, HAS BEGUN, AND WARMER TEMPERATURES ARE RAPIDLY MELTING THE LAKE. NOW STEPHAN AND ALLYCE MUST REEL IN ALL THEIR BELONGINGS LEFT ON THE ICE DURING WINTER BEFORE THEY SINK TO THE BOTTOM OF THE LAKE. YOU WANT TO START WITH THE BARBECUE? YEAH. TODAY IS THE FIRST DAY OF BREAK-UP FOR US. WE'VE WAITED AS LONG AS WE CAN. THE ICE STARTING TO TURN TO WATER BEHIND OUR HOUSE. COME ON, BETSY. AND NOW IT'S OUR CHANCE TO MOVE EVERYTHING THAT WE HAVE, THAT WE'VE STOWED ON THE ICE FOR THE WINTER, ON THE BOAT. AND YOU WONDER WHY I WANT A NEW BARBECUE. ANYTHING THAT'S ON THE LAKE HAS GOT TO COME OFF THE LAKE TODAY BECAUSE SHE'S THAWING FAST. DORA'S GONNA MISS HER LITTLE HOUSE. SHE LOVES IT OUT HERE ON THE ICE. IT'S HER OWN SPACE. THERE WE GO. NOW WE GOT TO LIFT IT OVER... HOLD ON. IT'S VERY, VERY SLIPPERY. STEPH AND I, ON OUR OWN, CAN'T LIFT THAT DOGHOUSE TO GET IT UP ON THE ROOF. AAH! SORRY. AAH, MY FOOT! SO FOR NOW, WE'RE MOVING IT FROM THE UNSAFE ICE ONTO THICKER ICE, WHICH WILL BUY US JUST ANOTHER DAY OR TWO. AND THEN, WHEN WE GET A LITTLE BIT MORE MAN POWER, WE CAN GET IT UP ON THE ROOF. THIS TIME OF YEAR, THE ICE JUST GETS CRAZY SHARP. AND POOR DORA, WALKING AROUND ON IT, IT JUST SLICES UP HER FEET. COME HERE. GOT TO PUT THIS ON YOU. SO THIS YEAR, WE DECIDED TO GET HER SOME BOOTIES. GOT ANOTHER PAW FOR YOU. DORA DOESN'T LIKE THIS RIGHT NOW, BUT RIGHT WHEN THEY'RE ALL ON HER AND SHE REALIZES SHE CAN RUN, SHE LOVES IT. ONCE THOSE BOOTIES ARE ON, SHE'S GONE. BE CAREFUL. THE ICE STILL ISN'T SAFE. LOOK AT YOU, HERCULES. THIS GIRL IS 100% NORTHERN-BORN, NORTHERN-BRED, NORTHERN-STRONG. HERE WE ARE, WE'RE SUPPOSED TO LIFT THESE EMPTY PROPANE TANKS. ONE, TWO... I'M THINKING I'LL GRAB ONE END, SHE'LL GRAB THE OTHER END. NO. GO, HERCULES. YOU NEVER CEASE TO AMAZE ME, MY LOVE. I TEND TO DO THE HEAVY WORK, 'CAUSE STEPH IS... WELL, HE'S STEPH. THIS IS ALL WE NEED OFF. I'LL BRING THE MOTOR UPSTAIRS, I'LL BRING THE GAS AUGER UPSTAIRS, AND WE'RE DONE. FOR ME, THE FOUR SEASONS, THE TRANSITIONS OF WEATHER AND THE TRANSITIONS OF CONDITIONS ON THIS LAKE IS WHAT MAKES IT REALLY WELL WORTH LIVING FOR. JUST OFF THE LAKE, SINCE RANDY'S CURRENT FLOATS ARE TAKING ON WATER AND MAY NOT WITHSTAND BREAK-UP, RANDY MUST NOW BUILD NEW PONTOONS FOR HIS HOUSEBOAT. HE'S HOPING THE RE-PURPOSED FUEL TANKS WILL PROVIDE A HIGHER LEVEL OF PROTECTION FOR HIS FAMILY. WHEN THAT ENTIRE SHEET OF ICE STARTS MOVING, THE MOMENTUM IS ABSOLUTELY UNSTOPPABLE. ALL OF THE PLANNING THAT I'VE DONE FOR THIS RAFT HAS BEEN, REALLY, TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO BUILD A RAFT STRONG ENOUGH TO WITHSTAND THE ICE CONDITIONS IN THE SPRINGTIME. THIS WOULD BE THE WEAK SPOT OF THE STRUCTURE, REALLY. SO, IT'S MY CHALLENGE TO BE ABLE TO STIFFEN THIS JOINT UP AND TO STRENGTHEN THE STRUCTURE LENGTH-WISE, THIS WAY. THE LAST THING I NEED TO BE WORRYING ABOUT IS WHETHER OR NOT MY FLOATS ARE HOLDING WATER, YOU KNOW, WHEN THE ICE STARTS MOVING AROUND. THAT'S JUST A BAD COMBINATION OF THINGS TO BE THINKING ABOUT AT THE SAME TIME. PUT THESE ABOUT AN INCH AWAY OVER HERE. I'D SAY THE WORST-CASE SCENARIO IS THAT THE ICE WILL, BASICALLY, COME INTO THIS BAY IN BIG, HARD SHEETS AND JUST PUSH RIGHT OVER THE ROCKS AND PUSH MY BOAT RIGHT UP ONTO THE ROCKS, WHICH WOULD NOT BE GOOD FOR IT. SO IN THAT SITUATION, I THINK, REALLY, ALL THAT I WOULD BE ABLE TO DO IS JUST, BASICALLY, PRAY. SEE IF WE CAN MAKE THIS THING FIT THE WAY IT DOESN'T WANT TO FIT. THIS IS THE REAL TEST. THERE WE GO. I'M JUST KEEPING MY FINGERS CROSSED AND PRAYING THAT THIS DESIGN'S GONNA HOLD UP. PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT I'LL BE ABLE TO GET THESE FLOATS IN THE WATER BEFORE BREAK-UP. IF IT DOESN'T, THEN I'M BACK TO THE OLD DRAWING BOARD, I GUESS. JUST OFF SHORE... WELL, YOU NERVOUS? YES. DON'T BE NERVOUS. ...GARY AND MOLLY SEARCH THE BAY FOR WEAKENING ICE TO CONDUCT THEIR SURVIVAL TEST. SO, TO PRACTICE GETTING OUT OF THE WATER... MOLLY'S NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE ICE. SHE'S NERVOUS ABOUT IT. AND IF YOU'RE GONNA LIVE OUT ON THE LAKE, YOU GOT TO BE ABLE TO GET COMFORTABLE ON THE ICE. ANYTHING NOT TO DO THAT I SHOULD KNOW? THE ICE THAT WE'RE STANDING ON RIGHT NOW IS SOLID. IT'LL HOLD OUR WEIGHT. AND AS YOU GET CLOSER TO THE EDGE, IT GETS WEAKER AND WEAKER. AND I WANT TO SHOW HER WHAT THE ICE FEELS LIKE WHEN YOU'RE WALKING ON IT AND WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE. YOU'RE WALKING ALONG. ALL OF A SUDDEN, ONE OF YOUR FEET GOES DOWN. YOU GO, "NO, I'M GOING IN." YOU TAKE ANOTHER STEP, IT'S GOING IN. GET DOWN. THE TRICK IS, WHEN YOU'RE GOING INTO THE ICE, SPREAD YOUR WEIGHT OUT. BECAUSE ALL OF YOUR FORCE IS THERE, IF YOU MOVE IT OUT OVER A BIGGER AREA, IT'LL HOLD YOU UP TILL YOU CAN GET BACK TO WHERE YOU CAME FROM. WALKING OUT TO WHERE I WAS GONNA GET IN THE WATER, I WAS DEFINITELY FEELING SCARED. LIKE, THIS IS REAL, THIS IS HAPPENING, AND THIS WATER'S COLD. I CAN'T HEAR ANYTHING. I DON'T ABOUT THIS ONE. THIS IS LIKE THROWING YOURSELF... MY GOD! IN YELLOWKNIFE BAY, BREAK-UP IS STARTING. SPRING'S THAW IS RAPIDLY TURNING FROZEN GREAT SLAVE LAKE BACK INTO WATER. I'M GONNA TIE YOU OFF OVER HERE. GARY USES HIS 30 YEARS' EXPERIENCE ON THE LAKE TO TEACH MOLLY HOW TO SURVIVE EVERY HOUSEBOATER'S NIGHTMARE. I CAN'T HEAR ANYTHING. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS ONE. THIS IS LIKE THROWING YOURSELF... MY GOD! THAT'S HOW QUICK IT HAPPENS. AND NOW I'M THERE, FREAKING OUT. LIKE A PRO! AND THEN GO GET DRY. THIS YEAR, THE ICE WAS A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN IT NORMALLY IS. USUALLY WHEN YOU'RE WALKING ON CANDLED OR WEAK ICE, IT MAKES A NOISE. IT HISSES AS IT'S GIVING AWAY. THIS YEAR, THE ICE JUST SEEMS TO LET GO... NO WARNING, NO NOISE. AND IT CAUGHT ME BY SURPRISE. I WASN'T EXPECTING IT. NOW, REMEMBER, PRACTICE YOUR DROPPING. THERE YOU GO. AAH! FIRST THING YOU GOT TO WORRY ABOUT IS PANIC, ALL RIGHT? WELL DONE. THAT'S AWESOME. I WAS SCARED WHEN I FIRST POPPED THROUGH THAT ICE. LIKE, IT WAS REAL. AND THE SHOCK KIND OF HITS YOU RIGHT AT ONCE, AND IT'S JUST... IT BECOMES A REALITY, AND IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG, I COULD BE IN SERIOUS DANGER. TRYING TO GET UP ON CANDLED ICE, WHEN IT'S ALL PACKED TOGETHER, IT SORT OF HOLDS YOU UP. BUT ONCE IT STARTS BREAKING OFF THE EDGE LIKE THAT, THERE'S NOT A LOT TO HOLD IT AND YOU CAN KIND OF TEAR THE EDGES OFF, SEE? IT MADE ME MORE NERVOUS SEEING THE DIFFERENT-COLORED ICE AND WHERE YOU SHOULD WALK AND WHERE NOT TO WALK, AND IT'S KIND OF FREAKY. YOU KIND OF NEVER KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. IT'S ALL MOVING UNDERNEATH ME, TOO. AAH! ON A HOUSEBOAT, THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS THAT CAN GO WRONG. AND OUT HERE, MISTAKES CAN COST YOU YOUR LIFE. NOW THAT MOLLY'S EXPERIENCED GOING THROUGH THE ICE, YEAH, I'M GONNA SLEEP BETTER. ALONG THE NORTHERN SHORE, RANDY FINISHED BUILDING A STRONGER, METAL FLOATATION RAFT FOR HIS HOUSEBOAT. NOW HE SCOUTS THE BEST LOCATION TO TEST ITS METTLE. I NEED TO GET THESE FLOATS OUT INTO THE BAY SO THAT I CAN WATCH THEM TO SEE HOW THEY BEHAVE IN REAL-WORLD CONDITIONS. I'M JUST HEADING OVER TO BAKER CREEK. IT'S BEEN NICE AND WARM OUT. WARM AND WINDY. AND, YOU KNOW, THE ICE HAS GOT TO BE DISAPPEARING FAST. I'M JUST HOPING THAT THINGS ARE GONNA HAVE CHANGED OUT HERE AND SEE SOME OPEN WATER. RANDY HOPES TO LAUNCH HIS FLOATATION RAFT FROM BAKER BAY AND FLOAT IT OVER TO HIS HOUSEBOAT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF YELLOWKNIFE BAY. IT'S A SHORT DISTANCE, BUT HE'LL NEED AN OPEN-WATER ROUTE WITH ENOUGH MELTED ICE. I SEE ICE PILED UP ON THE SHORE. THAT'S YELLOWKNIFE BAY OVER THERE. THAT'S WHERE MY HOUSEBOAT IS MOORED RIGHT NOW. IT'S GONNA BE A WHILE BEFORE THIS BIG ICE SHEET HERE WINDS UP BREAKING ITSELF UP ON ALL OF THE ROCKS AND, YOU KNOW, WEAKENING AND MELTING, UNTIL IT WILL ALLOW FOR NAVIGATION ACROSS TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BAY, THERE. THIS TWO-TON ICE SHEET, SEVERAL FEET DEEP, WOULD BE CAPABLE OF CRUSHING EVEN HIS METAL FLOATS. HE'LL NEED TO WAIT FOR THIS TO MELT OR MOVE OUT OF THE WAY BEFORE DEPLOYING HIS FLOATATION RAFT. BACK IN THE BAY, OVER AT THE FISH PLANT, FISHERMEN BRIAN AND HENRY KEEP AN EYE ON THE CHANGING CONDITIONS. GEEZ. I JUST LOOKED OUT THE WINDOW, THERE. MAN, THAT ICE IS MELTING REALLY FAST. YEAH, THAT'S NOT GOOD, IS IT? THAT'S NOT GOOD AT ALL. IT'S MOVED BACK LIKE THREE FEET IN THE LAST COUPLE HOURS. YEAH. DON'T LOOK GOOD, DOES IT? NO. NO, IT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD. THE DISAPPEARING ICE CONVINCES THEM THE TIME IS NOW TO PULL THEIR SNOWMOBILE OFF THE LAKE. OKAY. IN BUSINESS? YEAH. YOU READY? OKAY. I'M READY, MAN. THE ICE IS STARTING TO BREAK DOWN. IT'S A BRAND-NEW MACHINE LAST YEAR, AND I DON'T REALLY WANT TO BE DIGGING IT OFF OF THE BOTTOM HERE, SO... WE KEEP OURSELVES TO OUR LITTLE BRIDGE HERE SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY DRIVE IT RIGHT IN THE FRONT DOOR. SO THAT'S WHERE WE'LL PARK IT FOR THE SEASON. WITH THE SNOWMOBILE SAFELY ABOARD, BRIAN HAS TO PULL UP THE REMAINING SECTIONS OF THE WOODEN BRIDGE. AND THE TEAM'S PREPARATION FOR BREAK-UP IS COMPLETE. GEEZ! HOLY JESUS! ON GREAT SLAVE LAKE, WHERE RAPIDLY MELTING ICE SIGNALS THE COMING OF THE MOST DANGEROUS TIME OF YEAR, FISHERMAN BRIAN GETS IN OVER HIS HEAD. GEEZ! HOLY JESUS! THAT'S COLD! WOW. MY FREAKING BOOTS FEEL LIKE ABOUT 500 POUNDS. LET'S GET INSIDE IN THE WARMTH. I LOST MY BALANCE, THERE. I HAD TO STEP BACK. THE 30-DEGREE TEMPERATURES ON GREAT SLAVE LAKE CAN CAUSE HYPOTHERMIA IN MINUTES. OOH, OOH. HOLY JESUS, THAT'S COLD. BRIAN MUST QUICKLY GET OUT OF HIS WET CLOTHES AND IN FRONT OF A HEATER. **** IT'S WARM IN HERE. I BETTER GET THIS STUFF OFF. KIND OF... MY TOE OR SOMETHING HOOKED INTO THE PALETTE OR SOMETHING. I LOST MY BALANCE THERE A BIT, HAD TO STEP BACK. MAN. YEAH, THAT'S WET. YOU GET THAT ONE? YEAH. THIS ONE? YEAH. THANK YOU. THE COLD WATER KIND OF TAKES YOUR BREATH RIGHT AWAY. AS SOON AS YOU HIT THAT WATER, MAN, IT'S PEOPLE DROWN. HENRY DOESN'T SWIM. SHEILA DOESN'T SWIM. IN FACT, I DON'T KNOW A SINGLE FISHERMAN ON THE LAKE HERE THAT ACTUALLY SWIMS. SWIMMING ISN'T GONNA DO YOU TOO MUCH GOOD BECAUSE THE WATER'S SO COLD, YOU'RE GONNA DIE OF HYPOTHERMIA BEFORE YOU EVER GET ANYWHERE ANYWAYS. THIS IS A VERY, VERY COLD LAKE. WELL, I BET YOU'LL BE A LITTLE MORE CAREFUL THE NEXT TIME WE TRY IT. I HAVEN'T FALLEN INTO ICE WATER SINCE I WAS A KID. BROUGHT BACK A LOT OF OLD MEMORIES, THEN. WE SHOULD HAVE HAD THAT STUFF OFF THERE YESTERDAY, BUT IT WAS GETTING LATE AND I HADN'T GOT ANY SLEEP FROM DOING ALL THE PAPERWORK ALL NIGHT, SO... BUT THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO GET BACK OUT THERE AND GET THESE PALETTES OFF BECAUSE THAT ICE IS DISAPPEARING AS WE SPEAK. I TOOK A WALK TO SHORE TODAY AND THAT'LL BE THE LAST WALK THAT I TAKE THERE. YOU COULD FEEL THE ICE STARTING TO SHIFT, YOU COULD HEAR IT MOVING. SO IT'S RIGHT ABOUT TO BREAK APART. SO MY NEXT TRIP TO SHORE, I'LL BE TAKING A CANOE WITH ME LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE DOES. AT THIS TIME OF THE YEAR, I ALWAYS KEEP A ROPE RIGHT BY THE DOOR JUST IN CASE THAT HAPPENS. BY MORNING, THE MASSIVE ICE SHEETS ONCE SPANNING THE LAKE ARE SHATTERED, MAKING TRAVEL ACROSS THE SURFACE TREACHEROUS... ...AND SIGNALING THE ARRIVAL OF ONE OF THE DEADLIEST TIMES OF THE YEAR. BREAK-UP IS UPON US, AND IT'S SERIOUS BUSINESS. ON THE NEXT EPISODE OF "ICE LAKE REBELS"... **** YOU OKAY? DORA, YOU OKAY? ARE YOU OKAY? THE SUN IS BEATING THE CRAP OUT OF THIS ICE. THE ICE IS GONNA DETERIORATE MORE AND BREAK INTO SMALLER PIECES AND PILE UP ALONG THE ISLAND AND WHERE ALL THE HOUSEBOATS ARE. WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. WHOA. THAT WHOLE PIECE, I THINK, JUST BROKE OFF. DOWN IN THE BAY, HERE, I SENSED ANOTHER COUPLE OF CHUNKS COMING THERE. IF YOU WAIT TILL THE LAST MINUTE FOR EVERYTHING, YOU'RE REALLY NOT GONNA LIKE IT. EVERY YEAR, IT'S A **** HASSLE. YOU COULD GO TO SLEEP AT NIGHT ALL TIED UP ON THE SHORE AND WAKE UP IN THE MORNING AND YOU ARE SOMEWHERE ELSE. YOU KNOW, THE ICE HAS JUST PUSHED YOU RIGHT OFF INTO THE BLUE YONDER.
