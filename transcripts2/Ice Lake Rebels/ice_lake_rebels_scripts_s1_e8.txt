 NEAR THE TOP OF THE WORLD... ON CANADA'S GREAT SLAVE LAKE, A BAND OF REBELS HAVE SURVIVED A LONG, BRUTAL WINTER LIVING OFF THE GRID. I LOVE BEING OUT HERE BECAUSE A GUY CAN GO ABOUT HIS BUSINESS AND LIVE HIS LIFE FREE, LIKE MAN IS SUPPOSED TO LIVE. NOW THE 10,000 SQUARE MILES OF FROZEN LAKE ARE BREAKING UP. THERE'S STILL A LOT OF SOLID ICE OUT THERE, AND A BUNCH OF ICE FLOE IS GONNA COME CRASHING DOWN ON THE HOUSEBOATS.

 AND WHEN THEY TOUCH, THEY DON'T KISS. THEY RIP THINGS APART. IF THESE ICE FLOES START TO HIT US, IT COULD CRUSH US. MASSIVE SHEETS OF UNFORGIVING ICE ARE ON A COLLISION COURSE WITH THE HOUSEBOATERS. SO, I WOKE UP THIS MORNING, AND JUST LIKE THE WEATHER FORECAST PREDICTED, I GOT HIT WITH SOME WIND. A BIG PIECE OF ICE COMES OUT THAT SIDE, POUNDS ME, AND I'M BREACHED. AND THEN WE SINK. IT'S VERY DANGEROUS. IT'S VERY STRESSFUL. TO PRESERVE THEIR COMMUNITY, THEY MUST SCRAMBLE TO DEFEND THEIR HOMES...

 DAD! I'M CRASHING INTO YOUR DOCK. **** GREAT! WATER IN THE CROTCH! SO COLD. ...RISKING LIFE AND LIMB TO SAVE THEIR HOUSEBOATS FROM THE LAKE'S ICY DEPTHS. **** ARE YOU OKAY?! ARE YOU OKAY?! SPRING HAS ARRIVED ON GREAT SLAVE LAKE, USHERING IN THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE TIME OF THE YEAR FOR THE SMALL FLOATING COMMUNITY WHO CALLS YELLOWKNIFE BAY HOME. AFTER A LONG, COLD WINTER, THIS IS A CRAZY BREAK-UP. I'VE NEVER SEEN A BREAK-UP LIKE THIS. DURING THIS TIME, THE FROZEN LAKE THAWS AND FRACTURES, SENDING MASSIVE ICE FLOES THE SIZE OF FOOTBALL FIELDS BARRELING THROUGH THEIR SMALL CHANNEL ON THEIR WAY TO MELTING IN THE OPEN LAKE. THE ICE FLOES START MOVING AROUND AND BASHING INTO YOUR HOUSE AND MOVING YOUR HOUSE 50 FEET DOWN THE ROAD FROM WHERE IT WAS AN HOUR AGO. FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS, HOUSEBOATERS WILL BE DODGING ICE AND SHORING UP THEIR BARGES TO PREPARE FOR ANY COLLISIONS WITH THESE MASSIVE ICE SHEETS. FIANCéS STEPHAN HERVIEUX AND ALLYCE RATTRAY HAVE LIVED ON THIS LAKE FOR FOUR YEARS. DURING BREAK-UP, THEY CONSTANTLY MONITOR THE ICE FLOES HEADING THEIR WAY. PRESSURE HEADING SOUTH HAS JUMPED INTO THE HIGH WIND POINT FOR GREAT SLAVE LAKE. WIND SPEEDS ARE 30 TO 40 KILOMETERS PER HOUR, WITH GUSTS OF UP TO 50 KILOMETERS PER HOUR. ARE YOU SERIOUS? 40 "K" WINDS OVERNIGHT? THAT'S GONNA CHANGE EVERYTHING. THIS IS THE CALM BEFORE THE STORM. I KNOW IT. IT KIND OF FEELS THAT WAY? I KNOW IT. HOW ARE THE CLOUDS LOOKING? BAD. THE FIANCéS KNOW ALL TOO WELL WHAT DAMAGE THE HIGH WINDS CAN BRING. GOT HIT A COUPLE YEARS AGO. I ALMOST ENDED UP ON MY NEIGHBOR'S DOORSTEP. I COULD HAVE LOST MY VESSEL AND DAMAGED THEIRS SERIOUSLY, AND THERE'S NOTHING... ABSOLUTELY NOTHING... I COULD HAVE DONE TO PREVENT THAT. THIS YEAR, I NEED TO MAKE SURE MY HOUSE IS NOT GONNA GET DRAGGED YET AGAIN. NO. DEFINITELY, WE'RE GONNA GET SLAMMED. YEAH, THERE'S LOTS? BIG-TIME. WITH WIDE ICE SHEETS CREEPING INTO THE BAY, STEPHAN COMES UP WITH A PLAN TO MINIMIZE THE THREAT TO THEIR HOUSEBOAT. OKAY... ...WE GO OUT THERE AND WE ACCELERATE THIS. WE OPEN THE PATH. WE OPEN THAT CHANNEL SO WHEN IT COMES IN, IT DOESN'T PILE UP AGAINST THE ICE THAT'S HERE. IT JUST GOES FREE. WELL, IF THE WIND'S GONNA BE PUSHING IT, THE CURRENT'S GONNA BE PUSHING IT, IT'S GONNA BE COMING AT US. BREAK EVERYTHING WE CAN. LET'S DO IT. LET'S DO IT, LET'S DO IT. EVERY DIME WE GOT IS IN THIS BOAT. THIS IS MY LIFE. THIS IS ABOUT ME AND ALLYCE SECURING OUR HOME AND INVESTMENT. ACROSS THE BAY, FIRST HOUSEBOATER GARY VAILLANCOURT KNOWS WHAT KIND OF DESTRUCTION BREAK-UP CAN BRING TO FLOATING HOMES, A LESSON HE'LL HAVE TO TEACH HIS DAUGHTER, MOLLY. WHEN IT GETS LIKE THAT HERE, WE GOT TO PAY ATTENTION. THE ICE SHEET GRABS YOU, AND YOU CAN'T GET OUT OF IT, 'CAUSE IT'S A SOLID PIECE. AND IT JUST TAKES YOU WHEREVER IT WANTS TO GO. THERE WAS ONE YEAR THE LAKE BROKE UP. THE ICE DIDN'T. THEN THE WIND CAME OUT. IT STARTED BREAKING ANCHOR LINES. IT BROKE ALL MY LINE. TOOK A COUPLE OF HOUSES AND PUSHED THEM RIGHT UP ON THE SHORE, RIPPED OUT ABOUT 150 FEET OF DOCK, AND THEN STUFFED IT UP ON TOP OF THE LAND. THE ICE IS STRONGER THAN ANY ANCHOR YOU CAN PUT DOWN. IT BENDS STEEL, BREAKS LINES THAT SHOULD... YOU KNOW, 5,000, 6,000 POUNDS IT TAKES TO BREAK THESE LINES, AND IT SNAPS IT. BREAK-UP AND FREEZE-UP ARE THE MOST DANGEROUS TIMES OF YEAR. YOU JUST KIND OF NEVER KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. I REALLY HOPE NOTHING BREAKS. I'M FREAKING OUT A LITTLE BIT. YOU KNOW WHAT I LIKE TO CHECK ON RIGHT NOW, THOUGH, WHEN WE GET READY FOR THIS BLOW IS... WE'RE GONNA CHECK ALL THE BOARDING LINES, EVERYTHING, MAKE SURE EVERYTHING'S TIED UP PROPERLY. SO WE SHOULD DO THAT NOW BEFORE IT GETS REALLY BAD, OKAY? OKAY, LET'S GO DO THAT. LET'S GO DO THAT RIGHT NOW. OKAY. I DON'T KNOW WHEN THIS IS ALL GONNA ROLL IN, SO WE BETTER GET ON THIS RIGHT AWAY. THIS ONE'S EASY. SINCE 1 CUBIC YARD OF BREAK-UP ICE WEIGHS 1 TON, EVEN A SMALL ICE SHEET CAN RIP UP ANCHOR LINES AND SMASH HOUSEBOATS INTO ONE ANOTHER. THE BEST FIRST DEFENSE IS RE-SECURING THEIR ANCHOR LINES. GOOD. YOU'RE A FAST LEARNER. SAME? YEAH, WE NEED A LITTLE MORE... PICK A LITTLE SLACK OUT OF THAT, TOO. ATTAGIRL. THE WORST THAT CAN HAPPEN IN THIS WIND IS IT ALL END UP ON THE SHORE. REALLY SCARY WHEN THE WIND'S GOING THE OTHER WAY, 'CAUSE YOU CAN TAKE A TRIP DOWN THE BAY. WE'VE LOST A HOUSEBOAT. WE'VE BENT THINGS. WE'VE BROKE ANCHOR LINES. THERE'S A LOT OF DAMAGE THAT CAN HAPPEN OR THE GODS MIGHT SMILE AND NOTHING HAPPENS. IT CAN CHANGE IN A FLASH. HOUSEBOATS WITHOUT MOTORS THAT ARE CAST ADRIFT HAVE ZERO NAVIGATION AND WOULD BE AT THE MERCY OF THE LAKE. I HAVE THOUGHT MANY TIMES THAT I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE. AND THEN, I JUST SAY, "NO. I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE." I DON'T CARE HOW TOUGH IT IS. IT GIVES YOU SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN'T GET ANYPLACE ELSE. THERE'S A DISTINCT SENSE OF FREEDOM TO DO WHAT YOU'D LIKE TO DO. IT GIVES YOU SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN'T GET ANYPLACE ELSE. BACK AT THE KIMBERLITE... KEEP IT CONSISTENT. READY? READY? RAMMING SPEED! ...STEPHAN AND ALLYCE ARE USING THEIR CANOE AS A BATTERING RAM, BREAKING THE ICE SO ONCOMING FLOES WILL MOVE THROUGH QUICKLY, RATHER THAN PILING UP AND VEERING TOWARDS THEIR HOME. IT WANTS TO COME APART. LOOK AT IT. IT'S ALREADY COMING APART. THE THRILL OF LIVING ON A HOUSEBOAT IN THE SUBARCTIC IS A BALANCE BETWEEN NATURE AND THE GOOD TIMES... ...AND THE DANGEROUS TIMES. YES! READY TO WIGGLE? READY TO WIGGLE? YEP. LET'S DO IT. YEAH. LOOK AT THAT **** HON. LOOKIT ON MY LEFT. LOOK AT THAT. THAT'S BREAKING ALL AWAY. YEAH. LISTEN TO THAT, HON. CANDLES ARE BREAKING UP. THAT'S GREAT. BREAK-UP IS A VERY DANGEROUS AND UNPREDICTABLE TIME. IT'S HARD WORK BREAKING UP THE ICE. AND SOMETIMES, YOU HAVE TO BE OUT THERE FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS JUST STOMPING ON IT AND CRACKING IT AND TRYING TO MAKE HEADWAY SO THE ICE DOESN'T SLAM INTO YOUR HOUSEBOAT AND CRUSH THE DAMN THING. ...HOW BIG THIS PIECE IS, BABE? NICE. LET'S GO FORWARD. LIFE ON THE WATER IS A LOT DIFFERENT. IT'S A LOT HARDER. EVERYTHING YOU DO HAS MULTIPLE STEPS. BUT, AT THE END OF THE DAY, YOU FEEL ACCOMPLISHED. **** READY? ONE, TWO... OKAY, BREAK EVERYTHING YOU GOT. BREAK EVERY... WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. BACK IT UP HERE. WANT TO MOVE FORWARD A LITTLE BIT? YEP. THAT'S STRONG. GOOD JOB. STOP. HOLD. WHOO-HOO-HOO! CAREFUL. HERE IT COMES. MORE IS GETTING THROUGH. THERE WE ARE. WE'RE GOOD. THAT WHOLE PIECE, I THINK, JUST BROKE OFF. THIS SIDE'S GOING BACK. LOOK AT THAT. WATCH IT. LOOK AT THAT. LOOK... A FISSURE. LOOK AT THAT! OPENED UP! ALL RIGHT. BEAUTIFUL! BEAUTIFUL! YEAH! ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BAY, HOUSEBOATER "PIKE" MIKE HARRISON HAS HIS OWN ICE PROBLEMS. HIS BOAT, THE BELLE MARIAH, HIS ONLY METHOD OF TRANSPORTATION ON THE LAKE, HAS A LEAK. AND HE NEEDS TO GET HER OUT OF THE WATER BEFORE HIGH WINDS AND PROJECTILE ICE FLOES DO EVEN MORE DAMAGE. THE BOAT'S LEAKING, AND IT WOULD SINK. AND I DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN, SO I HAVE TO PULL THAT UP ON THE TRAILER AND RIVET THE HULL. WELL, THINGS HAVE CHANGED A LOT HERE OVERNIGHT. ALL RIGHT. LET'S SEE IF WE CAN MOVE IT. MIKE IS TRYING TO WINCH HER UP TO DRY LAND, BUT THE BELLE IS HUNG UP ON ICE. IT'S LOOSE. I'VE GOT TO GET THIS THING MOVED OUT OF THE WAY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. THIS BEING STUCK THERE IS SLOWING ME DOWN. GONNA MOVE IT FROM THIS END A LITTLE SOFTER. JUST GOT TO GET IT GOING AN INCH OR TWO. AS "PIKE" MIKE PUSHES HIS BELLE MARIAH INTO THE WATER, HE SLIPS ON THE BREAK-UP ICE... ...PUTTING HIS BOAT IN DANGER. WHOA-HO-HO. ON CANADA'S GREAT SLAVE LAKE, SPRING CONDITIONS SIGNAL THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE TIME OF THE YEAR, WHEN THOUSANDS OF SQUARE MILES OF ICE BREAK UP AND COLLIDE. UP IN YELLOWKNIFE BAY, "PIKE" MIKE HARRISON IS TRYING TO HAUL ASHORE THE BELLE MARIAH, HIS ONLY MODE OF TRANSPORTATION ON THE LAKE BEFORE HIGH WINDS SMASH SHEETS OF BREAK-UP ICE INTO HIS DAMAGED HULL... WHOA-HO-HO. ...WHEN HE LOSES FOOTING... **** ...ALMOST CAPSIZING HIS BOAT. ALL RIGHT, BACK TO PLAN "A." HOISTING HEAVY EQUIPMENT... IT'S ALWAYS EASIER WITH A FEW EXTRA HANDS. PROBLEM IS... I ONLY HAD TWO TO WORK WITH. WE'RE LAUNCHING HER. THE BELLE MARIAH SWIMS. AMAZING. SHE'S STILL HUNG UP ON THE ICE ON HER STERN A BIT THERE. IT'S JUST NOT COMING UP ON THE TRAILER AS EASILY AS I'D LIKE IT TO. MIKE HOPS ABOARD TO GRAB SOME CHAINS SO HE CAN PULL THE BELLE ONTO THE TRAILER, WHEN THE BOAT DRIFTS TOO FAR FROM SHORE. WAIT. COME ON, BABY. SURE ENOUGH. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET BACK. MAYBE I CAN GET UP OFF OF THE NOSE. LIVING ON A HOUSEBOAT ON A FROZEN LAKE IS SOMETHING EVERYBODY SHOULD TRY ONCE IN THEIR LIFE. GOOD. A NEW DAY ON YELLOWKNIFE BAY BRINGS WITH IT WIND GUSTS CAPABLE OF HURLING 500-TON UNDERWATER ICEBERGS AT THE HOUSEBOATS WITH THE POTENTIAL TO CRUSH THEIR METAL HULLS AND SINK THEM. - LOOK AT THAT, HON. - YEAH. THAT'S A LOT OF WIND STILL. YEAH. NO, IT'S GUSTING RIGHT NOW. SURE IS. YOU CAN'T INSURE A HOUSEBOAT, SO IF IT SINKS, YOU'RE OUT YOUR MONEY. YOU'VE GOT NO INVESTMENT. YOU'RE DONE. HOLY **** YEAH, THIS SIDE IS WAY WORSE. HOLY **** MAN, IT IS WINDY OUT HERE. AT LEAST WE DID A GOOD JOB YESTERDAY. YEAH, GOOD JOB. LOOK AT THAT CHANNEL OPENED RIGHT UP? **** DIP, BANG. NO, WE'RE IN THE MUD. YEAH. LOOK AT THAT, HON. WE'RE, LIKE, IN A COUPLE OF FEET OF WATER. THERE'S NO WAY WE'RE NOT IN THE MUD. ALTHOUGH THEIR WORK YESTERDAY SPARED THEM FROM ANY DIRECT HITS, THE WIND IS NOW PUSHING THEIR HOUSEBOAT BROADSIDE, BEACHING THEM. HOLY **** LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. WE GOT TO MOVE IT OUT? WE GOT TO MOVE IT OUT. THE CHANNEL WE MADE REALLY WAS HELPFUL, BUT WE STILL GOT HIT WITH SOME ICE, AND TO THE POINT WHERE MY VESSELS MOVED ABOUT 10 FEET BACK. AND NOW I'M BEACHED ON THE BACKSIDE. IT'S SHALLOW, AND I CAN'T HAVE THAT. THAT PONTOON IS GONNA BOUNCE AND POUND AND BOUNCE AND POUND, AND IT WILL RUPTURE. PONTOONS ARE THE EQUIVALENT TO A FOUNDATION FOR A HOUSE, HOLDING IT IN PLACE, EXCEPT, ON WATER, A CRACKED PONTOON MEANS YOUR HOUSE SINKS TO THE DEPTHS. THIS IS GONNA BE TRICKY, HON. THIS IS GONNA BE REALLY, REALLY TOUGH. TO GET THEIR KIMBERLITE OFF THE LAKE'S BOTTOM, THE COUPLE WILL UNTIE THEIR MOORING LINES AND USE THEIR SMALL MOTORBOAT TO PULL THEIR HOUSE OFF THE MUD. NOT GOOD. IT'S GONNA WORK THE MOTOR, THAT'S FOR SURE. YEAH, IT'S GONNA WORK THAT MOTOR HARD. I'LL LOOSEN OFF THE BACK END. YOU LOOSEN OFF THE FRONT END. OKAY, THIS ONE'S UNDONE. COOL. THIS ONE'S UNDONE AND RESET. COOL. BETTER. GOOD. READY? YEP. ALL RIGHT. LET'S HOPE THIS WORKS. NOPE. WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH POWER OR... NO, NO. WE'RE STUCK IN THE MUD, HARDCORE. **** A FREE-FLOATING HOUSEBOAT COULD BE PULLED BY HAND, IF NECESSARY, BUT A BEACHED ONE WOULD NEED TO BE LIFTED OR JACKED UP FIRST. I GOT TO GRAB THE WADERS. I GOT TO SUIT UP, GET DOWN THERE. **** OKAY, PUT THAT LAYING DOWN, AND WE'LL GET POUNDS OF ICE. READY? YEAH. I KNOW YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT THE HOUSE, BUT WHEN YOU GET COLD, YOU GOT TO COME OUT. WHOA, YEAH. THIS WATER IS FREEZING COLD. HE DOESN'T WANT TO GO IN THERE AT ALL. YEAH. **** SHE'S COLD. HOLY **** SHE IS COLD. THIS IS WATER THAT NOBODY GOES IN AT THIS TIME OF THE YEAR... VOLUNTARILY. THIS WATER IS DANGEROUSLY COLD. I GOT TO FIGURE THIS OUT. AND IT'S THE LAST THING I WANT TO DO. YEAH, WE'RE IN THE MUD. YOU WERE RIGHT. DEAD IN THE MUD. - YEP. - BIG-TIME. NOW, THERE'S NO WAY I CAN GET THAT JACK. LOOK. IT'S JUST GONNA SINK. THERE'S NO CLEARANCE. THERE'S NOT EVEN AN INCH OF CLEARANCE. WE'RE JUST SITTING IN THE MUD. AND LOOK AT... LOOK AT THIS. GETTING SHALLOWER. YEAH. SO, YEAH, WE'RE DEFINITELY STUCK. WE'RE **** ACROSS THE BAY... DAD! THE LAKE'S SEVERE CONDITIONS HAVE SNAPPED THE MOORING LINES ON THE MOLLY BARGE. IT COULD HIT ANYONE, CAUSE A LOT OF DAMAGE OR GO DOWN THE BAY OR WORSE. SO I WAS DEFINITELY NERVOUS ABOUT THAT. I'M CRASHING INTO YOUR DOCK. THAT ICE MUST HAVE BUSTED THE LINE. THE DAMN ICE. NOW GARY AND MOLLY MUST REGAIN CONTROL OF HER HOUSEBOAT BEFORE THE WIND AND ICE SMASH IT INTO GARY'S CT BARGE. WHEN I SAW THE MOLLY BARGE SITTING SIDEWAYS LIKE THAT, I KNEW I HAD TO GET ON IT QUICK. IT ALWAYS GIVES YOU A BIT OF A START WHEN YOU SEE A HOUSE SITTING AT 90 DEGREES FROM WHERE IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE. I WAS CONCERNED THAT IT WAS GONNA GET TANGLED UP IN THE BACK OF MY BOAT, SO I DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME TO WASTE. WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO? I'M GONNA TRY TO GET THIS ICE OUT OF THE WAY FIRST SO I CAN PUSH YOU AROUND. LIVING ON A BOAT... IT HAS ITS CHALLENGES, BUT I THINK, ULTIMATELY, IT GIVES YOU A KIND OF STRENGTH OF CHARACTER. THE RESPONSIBILITY IS THRUST ON YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT BEING TOLD WHAT TO DO. IF YOU DECIDE THAT THIS FREEDOM IS TO BE ABUSED, THEN YOU WON'T LAST VERY LONG OUT THERE. I'M GONNA HOOK ON TO YOU AND I'M GONNA TRY AND PULL YOU UP INTO THE WIND AGAIN, OKAY? THERE'S SOME MORE ICE COMING HERE. WE BETTER GET GOING. OKAY. IF THEY CAN'T SECURE THE BARGE, HIGH WINDS CAN BLOW IT ACROSS THE BAY, TRANSFORMING MOLLY'S HOUSE INTO A 3-TON CRUSHER CAPABLE OF THE SAME IMPACT AS A CAR CRASH. OKAY. LET HER GO. WATCH YOUR HANDS, WATCH YOUR FINGERS. OKAY, I'M GONNA GO AROUND THE BACK NOW AND GET THAT OTHER ROPE AND TIE IT OFF. IT'S GETTING PRETTY CLOSE IN THE BACK. ARE YOU GONNA GROUND OUT? I'M GONNA BE OKAY, HONEY. LET THE SLACK GO FOR A SECOND. IT'S STUCK ON THAT ICE. EVERY YEAR, IT'S A **** HASSLE. WE'RE STUCK HERE ON THIS PIECE OF ICE, SO I'M GONNA TRY AND STRAIGHTEN IT OUT SOME MORE. RELYING ON HIS OUTBOARD MOTOR TO PULL THE HOUSEBOAT BACK INTO POSITION, GARY ACCIDENTALLY HITS HIS OWN BARGE, PLUNGING HIS STILL-RUNNING ENGINE INTO THE LAKE. **** GREAT! DAD! IN THE SUBARCTIC, ON GREAT SLAVE LAKE, BREAK-UP IS ONCE AGAIN PROVING TO BE THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE TIME OF THE YEAR. IN YELLOWKNIFE BAY, WITH DOZENS OF HOUSEBOATS DESTROYED THROUGH THE YEARS, GARY VAILLANCOURT IS TRYING TO PREVENT THE MOLLY BARGE FROM COLLIDING WITH HIS HOUSEBOAT... **** GREAT! ...WHEN HIS OUTBOARD MOTOR FALLS IN THE LAKE. SON OF A **** AS I WAS GUIDING IT INTO ITS FINAL POSITION, ALL OF A SUDDEN, I BUMP INTO THE BACK OF THE DOCK. SO THE MOTOR CLIMBED RIGHT OFF THE BACK OF THE BOAT AND WENT INTO THE WATER. **** IF THE WOODEN MOLLY BARGE COLLIDES WITH GARY'S STEEL CT BARGE, IT COULD TURN MOLLY'S HOME INTO SPLINTERS AND SEND IT TO THE BOTTOM. I'M PISSED OFF. WITH HIS OUTBOARD MOTOR OUT OF COMMISSION, GARY HOPS INTO HIS CANOE IN A LAST-DITCH EFFORT TO RE-TIE THE BARGE'S MOORING. IF THE BOATS BUMP INTO EACH OTHER, YOU'VE GOT TONS OF MATERIAL MOVING UP AND DOWN, AND WHEN THEY TOUCH, THEY DON'T KISS. THEY RIP THINGS APART AND THEY START BUSTING THINGS AS THEY HIT. IS THIS LINE SUPPOSED TO BE SO LOOSE? I'M JUST TAKING THE SLACK OUT OF ALL THE LINES NOW SO IT'LL HOLD ITS POSITION. I HAVE IT. DO YOU WANT ME TO FEED IT TO YOU? LET IT GO. I THINK WE'RE GONNA CALL THAT GOOD. THANKS, DAD, FOR KEEPING MY HOUSE FROM FLOATING AWAY. YOU'RE WELCOME. OFF THE SHORES OF YELLOWKNIFE BAY, WITH THE HOUSEBOAT SHELTERING HIS SIX CHILDREN TAKING ON WATER... JUST GOES JUST BELOW THE WATERLINE. ...RANDY SIBBESTON HAS BUILT NEW STEEL FLOATATIONS TO KEEP IT FROM SINKING. HIS STRATEGY IS TO FLOAT THE METAL BARRELS 5 MILES DOWN THE YELLOWKNIFE RIVER TOWARD THE BAY IN HOPES OF EVENTUALLY TRANSFERRING HIS HOUSE ON TOP OF THESE NEW FLOATS. I BUILT THIS NEW SET OF FLOATS AS AN EXPERIMENT, YOU KNOW, SOMETHING THAT'S GONNA BE COST-EFFECTIVE AND NICE AND TOUGH. BUT I'M NOT GOING TO PUT THE CABIN ON THERE UNTIL I'VE HAD A CHANCE TO TEST THOSE FLOATS, BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO SEE MY HARD WORK GO DOWN INTO THE LAKE. IT'S GONNA SWING AROUND THE OTHER WAY, SO LET'S JUST LET IT GO. WE'LL LET THE CURRENT DO ITS JOB. WITH THE NEW PONTOONS PERFORMING WELL, RANDY CONSTRUCTS A TEMPORARY SHELTER ATOP THE RAFT. THE ICE IS REALLY THICK THIS YEAR. IT'S BEEN AN UNUSUAL BREAK-UP. THE SHIFTING LAKE ICE IS VERY UNPREDICTABLE. WELL, I'M AT THAT WONDERFUL POINT WHERE I'VE PRETTY MUCH GOT EVERYTHING ALL SORTED OUT AND ORGANIZED. AND I'M PRETTY MUCH READY TO PUSH OFF AND LET THE CURRENT OF THE RIVER TAKE ME OUT ONTO THE LAKE. NOW RANDY HAS TO PADDLE 5 MILES TO YELLOWKNIFE BAY, HOPING HE DOESN'T HIT ICE FLOES. IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT I'M A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS. PUT A LOT OF TIME AND EFFORT IN AND THEN SUBJECT IT TO SOME OF THE MOST BRUTAL ICE CONDITIONS... IT'S A LITTLE BIT NERVE-RACKING. NEAR THE UPPER REACHES OF THE BAY, RAGNAR WESSTROM, OWNER OF THE TROUT ROCK HUNTING LODGE, SURVEYS THE FROZEN SHEETS BLOWN INTO THE WATERWAY BY HIGH WINDS. HE HAS TO GET HIS CREW AND PROVISIONS TO HIS OFF-THE-GRID HUNTING AND FISHING LODGE SO THEY CAN OPEN IT FOR THE SPRING SEASON. WE GOT 16 PEOPLE COMING IN HERE. WE HAVE TO USE THE TRUSTWORTHY HAGGLUNDS. OKAY. THE HAGGLUND BV206 IS THE MOST VERSATILE VEHICLE IN THE WORLD. IT'S A SWEDISH-MILITARY-DESIGNED TRACK MACHINE. FULLY AMPHIBIOUS. AND FOR US IN THE WINTERTIME, THE ONLY WAY WE CAN GET OUR GUESTS IN IS WITH THE HAGGLUND BV206. THE SHORT SUMMER MONTHS ARE RAGNAR'S ONLY OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE ENOUGH EARNINGS TO LAST THE YEAR. SO EACH DAY HIS LODGE IS CLOSED, IT THREATENS HIS ABILITY TO MAKE IT THROUGH THE BRUTAL WINTER. I'M DRIVER. OKAY, GUYS, WE'RE ALL PACKED UP AND READY TO GO. WE'RE GONNA DO SOME AMPHIBIAN SWIMMING, SO DON'T **** YOUR PANTS. BECAUSE THESE THINGS FLOAT, BELIEVE IT OR NOT. LET'S ROCK 'N' ROLL. WHOEVER WANTS TO GET IN HERE... WELL, THEY MAY HAVE TO SIT IN THE GREEN ONE WITH THE DOG. YEAH, NOW WE'RE HEADING IN TO TROUT ROCK LODGE ON GREAT SLAVE LAKE. AND THIS IS EXTREMELY LATE TO GO OUT, SO I'M A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE OPEN WATER. THE SPRING BREAK-UP HAS TRANSFORMED THE TERRAIN INTO A DANGEROUS SOUP OF MUD AND MELTED ICE. THE ROAD TO THE LODGE LEADS THE CONVOY TO THE EDGE OF THE LAKE. RIGHT ACROSS, RIGHT? BUT HIGH WINDS HAVE CLOGGED THE INLAND WITH DRIFTING 20-TON SECTIONS OF ICE. HIS NAVIGATIONAL GUIDE IS CONCERNED. NO, THAT'S NOT A GOOD THING, 'CAUSE WE DON'T KNOW HOW THICK THAT ICE IS, EITHER. BUT NOW WITH THE TRAILER, TOO, MY STEERING CAPACITY IS LIKE NIL. SO WE'RE SUBJECT TO THE WIND, TOO. YOU WANT US TO UNHOOK THE TRAILERS? NO. **** NO. 'CAUSE THAT ICE COULD BE THICK. LOOKS LIKE A BIG CHUNK, PROBABLY 2 FEET. THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING. SO I'M NOT SURE HOW FAR YOU CAN BREAK INTO THAT ICE. RAGNAR MUST MAKE A CHOICE... CROSS NOW AND RISK COLLIDING WITH A MASSIVE ICE FLOE OR WAIT IT OUT UNTIL CONDITIONS IMPROVE AND DELAY OPENING HIS LODGE. WHAT DO YOU THINK? MEANWHILE, AT THE KIMBERLITE... WHOO! WATER IN THE CROTCH! SO COLD. ...STEPHAN AND ALLYCE HAVE BEEN BATTLING THEIR OWN ICE PROBLEMS. MY LEGS ARE **** FROZEN STIFF HERE. STEPHAN HAS BEEN IN AND OUT OF THE WATER, TRYING TO FREE HIS HOUSEBOAT FROM A BLOCK OF ICE CAUGHT UNDERNEATH HIS PONTOON, BEACHING IT AND PUTTING IT AT RISK OF BEING SCUTTLED. I'M SOAKED THIS TIME. WORSE THAN LAST TIME. OKAY. I GOT THIS. YOU GOT THIS, BUD. OKAY. GET THE BOAT. BRING IT BACK AROUND. PUT IT IN. TUG ON IT. THIS THING'S GOT TO **** MOVE, MAN. IT'S GOT TO **** DESPERATE TO AVOID THE ONCOMING ICE'S DESTRUCTIVE FORCE, STEPHAN WILL USE HIS 25-HORSEPOWER MOTOR TO YANK HIS HOME FREE. I THINK I WANT TO PULL, TUG RIGHT HERE. YEAH, GET ME ALL NICE AND TIGHT THERE. PUT ME ON THAT CLEAT. READY? YEP. **** OFF! WHY DON'T IT GO? IT'S GOT TO BE THE ICE UNDER THERE? IT'S GOT TO BE. **** IT'S GOT TO BE THAT ICE. THAT PONTOON IS CLEAR AND **** FREE. THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NOTHING HOLDING IT THERE. IT'S THAT **** CHUNK OF ICE. I KNOW IT. IT HAS TO BE THAT. I AIN'T GIVING UP YET. I DIDN'T CHANGE TWO PAIRS OF PANTS AND FREEZE MY TESTES TWICE TO GIVE UP NOW. STEPH GETS SO INTO THE MOMENT THAT, SOMETIMES, IT DRIVES STEPH NUTS IF HE CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT. BUT THIS IS REALLY DANGEROUS WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW. I'M GONNA JERK THIS **** RIGHT OFF. **** I'LL TRY A DIFFERENT ANGLE. THERE'S SO MUCH ICE, MAN. I'M TAKING ON WATER EVERY TIME I SPLASH. WHAT THE **** AM I SUPPOSED TO DO NOW? WE'RE FROZEN INTO THE GROUND. THAT'S THE ONLY EXPLANATION. NOW I GOT AN ICEBERG IN MY PROP. THAT'S **** PERFECT. ONE MORE SHOT AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE I CAN DO, SWEETIE. AS STEPHAN TRIES TUGGING THE HOUSEBOAT OFF THE MUD, THE UNTHINKABLE HAPPENS. **** ARE YOU OKAY?! ARE YOU OKAY?! IT'S SPRING ON GREAT SLAVE LAKE, AND BREAK-UP IS IN FULL SWING, SENDING ICE FLOES WEIGHING OVER 2 TONS HURLING TOWARDS THE HOUSEBOATS ANCHORED IN YELLOWKNIFE BAY. I THINK I WANT TO PULL, TUG RIGHT HERE. YEAH, GET ME ALL NICE AND TIGHT THERE. PUT ME ON THAT CLEAT. FIANCéS STEPHAN HERVIEUX AND ALLYCE RATTRAY ARE TRYING TO TUG THEIR BEACHED HOUSEBOAT OFF THE MUD BEFORE THEIR FLOATS, OR PONTOONS, ARE CRUSHED BY THE LAKE'S BOTTOM, SINKING THEM. BECAUSE OF ALL THE ROCKS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE LAKE, IF WE GET PUSHED FURTHER INTO THE MUD, A PONTOON DEFINITELY WILL BE PUNCTURED. ONE MORE SHOT AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE I CAN DO, SWEETIE. HERE WE GO. HOLD ON! HERE WE GO. ARE YOU OKAY?! ARE YOU OKAY?! **** ARE YOU OKAY?! **** LINE SNAPPED. YEAH, I'M FINE. THANK GOD. **** WHEN I SAW THAT ROPE SNAP, MY HEART SANK. I KNOW WHAT BROKEN ROPES AND CHAINS CAN DO, AND IT IS NOT PRETTY. I'M PUSHING IT TOO HARD. SOMEBODY COULD HAVE GOT REALLY **** HURT THERE. PUSHING IT TOO HARD, STEPH. DORA'S OKAY? YEAH. YOU'RE OKAY? SHE'S FREAKED OUT. YEAH. WE THINK IT HIT THE WATER. THANK GOD. ALL RIGHT, THAT'S ALL I CAN DO, BABE. THAT'S ALL I CAN **** DO. I TRIED EVERYTHING I COULD. AND I THOUGHT, "GIVE IT MORE ROPE." MAYBE I COULD SNAP THAT BOAT RIGHT OUT OF PLACE. AND WHEN I DID, THE ROPE SNAPPED. I'VE ENDANGERED THE TWO PEOPLE THAT ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT TO ME IN MY LIFE. I CAN'T PUSH IT ANY FURTHER. I'VE PUSHED IT AS FAR AS I POSSIBLY CAN. AND THIS IS NOT SAFE. **** SHE'S SHAKING, THE POOR GIRL. IT'S OKAY, PUP-PUPS. SOME BACON TREATS WILL FIX THAT. I'M PRETTY SURE IT DIDN'T HIT HER. I'M SORRY, PUP-PUPS. I'M SORRY. PAPA'S SORRY. I'M PUSHING IT TOO HARD. CALL IT QUITS. TOMORROW'S ANOTHER DAY. **** IT'S GOT TO BE THAT ICEBERG. CAN'T BE ANYTHING ELSE. YEAH. I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY. YOU OKAY? YOU OKAY, LITTLE PUPS? COME ON, LET'S GET YOU INSIDE AND WARMED UP. YOU'VE BEEN OUTSIDE ALL DAY. LET'S GO. I'M TREMBLING FROM THE COLD. YOU READY, DORA? COME ON. LET'S GO. THANK YOU. COME ON, PUP. ALONG THE NORTH ARM OF THE LAKE, WIND-DRIVEN ICE FLOES ARE BLOCKING RAGNAR WESSTROM'S CONVOY FROM CROSSING THE LAKE. 'CAUSE WE GOT TO GO AROUND THE ICE. SO SHUT YOUR DOORS. CLOSE THE DOORS, MAKE SURE THEY'RE SEALED, BECAUSE WE'RE SINKING DOWN ALMOST TO THE WINDOW. SO, LET'S DO IT. THE HAGGLUND CANNOT BREAK THROUGH THE ICE, BUT WE CAN TRY TO GO AROUND IT. Okay, guys. We're gonna split up here now so we can cover a bigger area. Roger that. THE HAGGLUNDS MAY BE AMPHIBIOUS, BUT COLLIDING WITH A 20-TON ICE SHEET COULD ROLL THEM OVER. The driver is right on. There, boys. Step on it. It's there, too. WE MADE IT! YAY! THERE WAS LOTS OF ICE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE LAKE. SO WE'D GO DOWN TO DIFFERENT, DANGEROUS ANGLES THERE, BUT THE HAGGLUND CAME THROUGH. THAT WAS ALWAYS A DREAM OF MINE TO BUILD A CAMP IN THE WILDERNESS AND MAKE IT INTO A BUSINESS, BUT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT, A VERY HARD JOB. AND IT COULD BE DANGEROUS. BUT IT'S ALSO A PARADISE. WHEN EVERYTHING GOES WELL, YOU CAN ENJOY IT, THE PRISTINE WILDERNESS AND THE FREEDOM. YOU ARE FEELING LIKE YOU'RE ON TOP OF THE WORLD, YOU'RE THE KING IN YOUR KINGDOM, AND NOBODY CAN TELL YOU WHAT TO DO. AFTER THREE HOURS OF GRUELING TERRAIN, RAGNAR'S TEAM AND THEIR PROVISIONS REACH TROUT ROCK LODGE. TROUT ROCK LODGE. FINALLY HOME. SPRINGTIME. READY TO OPEN UP. OUT ON THE OPEN LAKE, RANDY SIBBESTON, HOPING TO SAVE HIS SINKING HOUSEBOAT, WHICH HOLDS HIS WIFE AND SIX KIDS, HAS BEEN PADDLING HIS NEW FLOATATION RAFT FIVE HOURS TOWARDS YELLOWKNIFE BAY... WHEN HE HEARS THE ALARMING SOUND OF BREAK-UP ICE. THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THAT SOUND? IT SOUNDS SORT OF MAGICAL, IN A WAY, BUT THAT'S ALSO THE SOUND OF DANGER, TOO, SO... RANDY'S ONLY A FEW MILES OUTSIDE THE ENTRANCE TO YELLOWKNIFE BAY. SO HE TRIES TO PADDLE THROUGH THE ICE SHEET TO REACH HIS HOME BEFORE SUNDOWN. BUT HE'S NO MATCH AGAINST THE POWERFUL FROZEN MASS. SOON, RANDY'S SURROUNDED BY A REMNANT FROM GREAT SLAVE LAKE'S WINTER. WELL, IT'S A LITTLE BIT FREAKY ONCE THE ICE KIND OF CLOSES IN AROUND YOU, AND IT ENGULFS YOU. AND THEN YOU WIND UP TRAPPED IN IT. NOW TRAPPED IN THE ICE, RANDY'S FORCED TO HUNKER DOWN ON HIS RAFT UNTIL MORNING WITHOUT SUFFICIENT FOOD, WATER, OR SHELTER FROM THE ICY COLD. BIG, SOLID PIECE UNDER THERE. THE ICE IS JUST SO HEAVY AND IT HAS SO MUCH MOMENTUM. YOU COULD GO TO SLEEP AT NIGHT, ALL TIED UP ON THE SHORE, AND WAKE UP IN THE MORNING, AND YOU ARE SOMEWHERE ELSE. YOU KNOW, THE ICE PUSH YOU RIGHT OFF INTO THE BLUE YONDER. AS DANGEROUS ICE SHEETS MOVE ACROSS GREAT SLAVE LAKE, RANDY SIBBESTON WAS PADDLING HIS NEW FLOTATION RAFT TO YELLOWKNIFE BAY WHEN HE BECAME TRAPPED IN THE ICE OVERNIGHT WITHOUT SUFFICIENT SUPPLIES. NOW HE'S MANEUVERING BACK UP THE RIVER AWAY FROM THE ICE. IT TAKES SOME DOING. BUT THE WIND'S KIND OF STRONG, AND THAT TENT'S ACTING AS A SAIL, SO... THERE'S NO WAY TO GET OVER TO THE BAY, WHERE ALL THE OTHER HOUSEBOATS ARE. THERE'S A BIG SHEET OF ICE BLOCKING THE ENTRANCE TO THE BAY. SO, IT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS THIS TIME OF YEAR, YOU KNOW? BE NICE TO BE ABLE TO GET THIS THING BACK OVER INTO THE BAY, BUT YOU GET A LITTLE BIT AT THE MERCY OF THE WIND, YOU KNOW? LOOKS LIKE THERE'S SOME GOOD BUSHES OVER THERE TO TIE UP TO. AND THE SHORE'S NOT TOO ROCKY. YOU KNOW, SOME OF THAT STUFF OVER THERE IS JUST BRUTAL. THIS IS A BIG RAFT FOR ONE GUY TO BE PADDLING. AND EVERY TIME I GET CLOSE, A LITTLE GUST OF WIND COMES UP AND BLOWS ME FURTHER UP THE SHORE. WE'LL MAKE IT. IT'S JUST GONNA TAKE SOME DOING. SO, FOR NOW, FOR THE TIME BEING, THIS IS GONNA BE THE RESTING-PLACE FOR THIS RAFT. I'M GONNA GO BACK OVER TO MY HOUSEBOAT AND I'M GOING TO SIT DOWN AND I'M GONNA LOOK AT MY NUMBERS AGAIN AND REALLY TRY TO CONSIDER WHERE I UNDERESTIMATED THE WEIGHT OF THIS RAFT. AT THAT POINT, I'LL KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I'LL BE ABLE TO PUT ON HERE FOR A CABIN. DEFEATED BY THE LAKE AND UNABLE TO REACH THE BAY, RANDY WILL HAVE TO WAIT FOR BREAK-UP TO END. IF IT WEREN'T FOR THE WIND, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EASY. AS DAWN BREAKS ON THE BAY, STEPHAN AND ALLYCE ARE TRYING TO TUG THEIR BEACHED HOUSEBOAT OFF THE BOTTOM BEFORE MORE ICE FLOES PUSH THEM INTO HULL-CRUSHING ROCKS. HOLY. LOOK AT HOW MUCH THE LAKE HAS CHANGED SINCE YESTERDAY, HON. WHEN ALLYCE AND I GOT OUTSIDE, WE REALIZED THE WEATHER HAD CHANGED 180 DEGREES. NO BIG WINDS, NO ICE. EVERYTHING HAD MELTED. AND I THOUGHT WE MIGHT JUST GET LUCKY TODAY. THINK WE CAN WORK WITH IT TODAY? ABSOLUTELY. GONNA TAKE IT SLOW, THOUGH? I'M NOT GONNA DO WHAT I WAS DOING YESTERDAY, TUGGING AND PULLING. I GOT A LITTLE OVERZEALOUS, I KNOW. YESTERDAY, I STARTED OUT WITH THE RIGHT IDEA AND THEN I JUST TOOK IT TOO FAR. I SAY WE JUST KEEP IT HERE, NICE AND TIGHT. I'LL JACK IT UP. I SHOULD BE ABLE TO... AND JUST KEEP PULLING, JUST KEEP PULLING. I MEAN... IT'S GOT TO GIVE. YESTERDAY, WE WERE BATTLING THE WIND ALL DAY. WE GOT FRUSTRATED AND WE WERE DOING THINGS DANGEROUSLY. SO, TODAY, WE JUST HAD TO SCALE IT BACK. THE WATER'S JUST AS COLD. EVERY TIME I JUMP IN THE WATER, I'M REMINDED HOW COULD IT IS. DESPITE THE RISK OF HYPOTHERMIA, STEPHAN WILL HAVE TO JACK UP HIS HOUSEBOAT IN ORDER TO MOVE IT INTO DEEPER WATER, SAVING ITS FLOTATION FROM BEING CRUSHED BY THE LAKE BED. WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. YOU GOT THE TECHNIQUE DOWN NOW? I THINK I DO, IF I JUST USE MY TWO LEGS... AND STICK THE JACK IN THERE IF I CAN. I GOT IT ROLLING. THERE WE GO. I THINK WE'VE MOVING, BABE. HA HA! NO **** WHEN I STARTED JACKING THE HOUSE, I COULD FEEL IT COMING OUT OF THE MUD, AND I WAS REALLY HOPEFUL. WE GOT TO DO THIS NOW. WE GOT THE PERFECT WEATHER FOR IT. AFTER JACKING UP HIS HOUSEBOAT, STEPHAN DISCOVERS THE SOURCE OF THEIR TROUBLE... AN OVERSIZED ICE BLOCK LODGED UNDER THEIR HULL. THANK YOU. SEE THIS PIECE OF ICE? YEAH. SEE? AND THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WAS STUCK IN THE MUD. AND THAT'S DEEP. LOOK AT HOW BIG THAT IS. LOOK. SO, THE HOUSE IS JACKED UP, SO NOW IT'S TIME FOR ME TO JUMP IN THAT BOAT AND GIVE HER SOME THROTTLE AND MOVE THIS BABY OUT. I KNOW THERE'S A RUSH, BUT LET'S BE CAREFUL. MAKE SURE I DON'T HIT THAT LINE. I DON'T WANT TO CUT THAT MOORING. FOR THE FIANCéS, IT'S NOW OR NEVER. WITH THE ICE BLOCK REMOVED, THEY'RE GOING TO USE THE MOTORBOAT TO TUG THEIR HOUSEBOAT OFF THE LAKE'S MUDDY BOTTOM ONE LAST TIME. DURING THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE TIME OF YEAR, KNOWN AS BREAK-UP, STEPHAN AND ALLYCE'S HOUSEBOAT GOT BEACHED BY MASSIVE ICE FLOES. BUT AFTER HOURS OF JACKING UP THEIR HOUSE FROM THE LAKE BED, THEY'RE READY TO SEE IF THEY WILL FLOAT FREE AGAIN. NOW THAT THE HOUSE IS JACKED UP, I GOT TO JUMP IN THAT BOAT AND THROTTLE UP. I KNOW THERE'S A RUSH, BUT LET'S BE CAREFUL. OKAY. ARE WE MOVING? I THINK WE'RE MOVING, BABE. ARE WE MOVING? WE'RE MOVING. YES! THEIR HOUSEBOAT IS FINALLY FREE. I'M TELLING YOU... WHEN I HIT THAT THROTTLE AND THE HOUSE STARTED TO MOVE, YOU CAN'T IMAGINE HOW HAPPY I WAS. ONCE THE HOUSE STARTED TO MOVE, IT FELT SO GOOD. IT WAS JUST A RELIEF AFTER THE HARD, FRUSTRATING DAY THAT WE HAD YESTERDAY. WELL, WE'RE NICE AND DEEP. WE'RE NOT GONNA HIT GROUND ANYMORE. TIGHTEN THAT UP, AND LET'S MOVE TO THE OTHER SIDE, SHALL WE? OKAY. WHOO-WEE, THAT'S COLD. TO MAKE SURE THE NEXT WINDSTORM DOESN'T PUSH THEM BACK INTO THE MUD, STEPHAN AND ALLYCE ARE SECURING THEIR HOME IN DEEPER WATER. YEAH, MR. MUSCLE! - LOOK AT THAT? - GOOD JOB. 40 FEET BY 13 FEET... NOTHING TOO TOUGH FOR ME. IS THAT BETTER? YEAH, IT'S A LOT DEEPER HERE FOR ME. OKAY, TIE OFF RIGHT THERE. RIGHT HERE? YES. GREAT. PERFECT. YOU TIGHT? ALMOST. YEP. YOU GOOD? IT'S TIGHT. NICE! THAT'S IT? THAT'S IT. THAT'S IT. WHEN THE HOUSEBOAT STARTS TO ROCK FOR THE FIRST TIME, YOU FEEL IT MOVE TO THE WAVES, I JUST GET SO EXCITED, 'CAUSE I KNOW SUMMER'S HERE. THE BREAK-UP, WHERE YOU'RE WORRIED 24/7... IT'S ALL OVER AND IT'S TIME TO FINALLY RELAX AND LOVE BEING ON A HOUSEBOAT. ALL RIGHT. WE GOT THIS. RIGHT ON! GO, TEAM. IT FEELS GOOD TO BE DONE NOW. I KNOW. I KNOW IT WAS HARD. THE REASON WE LIVE ON THIS LAKE IS BECAUSE THE LAKE IS ALIVE. AND IT MAKES US FEEL ALIVE. WE ARE INTERTWINED TO THE LAKE. SURE, IT'S DANGEROUS AND, SURE, AT TIMES, IT'S A LOT OF FREAKIN' WORK. BUT, FOR ME, I LOVE IT. THE RESPONSIBILITY IS HIGH, THE PAY IS LOW, AND THE REWARD IS EXCEPTIONAL.
