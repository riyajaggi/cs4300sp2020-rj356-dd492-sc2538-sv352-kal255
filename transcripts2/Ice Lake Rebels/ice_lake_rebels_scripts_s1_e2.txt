 THE SUBARCTIC, CANADA. ONE OF THE COLDEST PLACES ON EARTH. IT'S HERE THAT A GROUP OF REBELS LIVE ON WATER, TRYING TO SURVIVE OFF-GRID WHILE FLOATING ON SHEETS OF ICE. THIS IS GREAT SLAVE LAKE, HOME TO A HANDFUL OF NORTHERNERS WHO'VE CHOSEN FREEDOM OVER SAFETY. IN THE BEGINNING, PEOPLE CAME OUT TO YELLOWKNIFE BAY BECAUSE THEY WERE REBELS, AND THEY WANTED THAT CERTAIN SENSE OF FREEDOM TO DO WHAT YOU'D LIKE TO DO.

 WHEN YOU'RE LIVING ON A HOUSEBOAT, THERE ARE NO PROPERTY TAXES. BUT LIVING FREE HERE COMES AT A STEEP PRICE. WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF THE AMENITIES IN TOWN YOU WOULD HAVE. IF MY HOUSEBOAT IS BURNING, THE FIRE DEPARTMENT'S NOT COMING TO SAVE MY ASS. I'VE GOT TO DO IT MYSELF. AFTER BRUTAL FALL STORMS POUNDED THESE HOUSEBOATERS... THE PLACE IS SHAKING. I'M KIND OF FREAKED OUT. ...IT'S FINALLY WINTER, AND THE HEAVING WAVES HAVE TURNED INTO MILES OF ICE,

 ALLOWING THEM TO WALK AND RIDE ON THE FROZEN SURFACE IN SEARCH OF FOOD... THE ICE IS STARTING TO FREEZE UP NOW, AND THIS IS THE LAST CHANCE THAT I'M GONNA HAVE. COLLECTING BERRIES, HARVESTING, AND HUNTING ARE A WAY OF LIFE FOR ME. ...AMIDST THE COLDEST WINTER ON RECORD. THE WINTERS ARE DEADLY AND LONG, AND THEY'RE COLD AS HELL. BASICALLY, IT'S EITHER GET MEAT OR YOU COULD BE IN TROUBLE. IT'S EARLY WINTER ON GREAT SLAVE LAKE IN YELLOWKNIFE BAY. DAYTIME LOWS OF SUB-ZERO WOULD DRIVE MOST PEOPLE INDOORS BY A FIRE. BUT HERE, THE WORK IS JUST BEGINNING. THIS IS THE CALM BEFORE THE STORM. IN A COUPLE WEEKS, THE TEMPERATURES WILL PLUMMET TO MINUS-40, AND DAYLIGHT WILL LAST THREE HOURS. SO, THE ESSENTIALS, LIKE FOOD AND WATER, NEED TO BE GATHERED NOW. ABOARD THE KIMBERLITE, STEPHAN HERVIEUX IS A FOUR-YEAR RESIDENT OF THE LAKE AND KNOWS ALL TOO WELL THAT EVERY DAY THE LAKE IS CALM... WHOA! WINTER... SHE IS HERE! ...IS A DAY TO PREPARE FOR THE NEXT BATTLE OF SURVIVAL. LIVING ON A HOUSEBOAT, YOU'VE GOT TO BECOME A VERY OBSERVANT PERSON. THE LAKE IS ALWAYS MOVING, ALWAYS TURNING AND CHANGING FROM DAY TO DAY. AND EVERYTHING SHE DOES CHANGES MY LIFE. LIFE ON THE LAKE ISN'T LIKE LIVING ANYWHERE ELSE. ONE OF THE MANY CHALLENGES OF LIVING OFF THE GRID IS HEATING UP THE ENTIRE HOUSE, BECAUSE IT GETS SO COLD. WE'VE GOT SOME FROST BUILDING UP HERE. YOU CAN SEE MY BREATH HERE. CLEARLY, THE TEMPERATURE IS BELOW ZERO UNDER THE BED HERE. OFF THE GRID HERE MEANS COMPLETE AUTONOMY... NO ELECTRICITY, HEAT, WATER, SEWER, OR HELP. ON A HOUSEBOAT IN THE ARCTIC, YOU REALLY GOT TO KEEP YOUR HEAT UP BIG TIME. SO THIS IS MY MAIN SOURCE OF HEAT RIGHT HERE... THE WOOD STOVE. SECONDARY SOURCE OF HEAT IS OVER HERE. IT'S MY BACKUP. WHEN YOU LEAVE THE HOUSEBOAT FOR MORE THAN A COUPLE HOURS, THE TEMPERATURE WILL DROP PRETTY DRAMATICALLY AND VERY, VERY QUICKLY. SO I'VE GOT A THERMOSTAT UP HERE. SO WHEN THE WOOD STOVE STARTS TO DIE DOWN AND I'M NOT GETTING HEAT FROM THAT, I'M GETTING HEAT FROM THE PROPANE HERE. AS YOU CAN TELL, IT'S WORKING JUST FINE, WHICH IS GOOD. AS STEPHAN TENDS TO SECURING THE CRITICAL HEAT FOR THEIR FLOATING HOME, HIS FIANCéE, ALLYCE, GETS THEIR DAILY WATER SUPPLY BY DIGGING THROUGH THE MASSIVE ICE IN THEIR FRONT YARD. LIVING OUT HERE, I'VE REALLY LEARNED HOW INDUSTRIOUS AND INDEPENDENT I CAN BE. I NEVER WOULD HAVE THOUGHT WHEN I WAS LIVING IN THE CITY THAT I COULD DRILL THROUGH SIX FEET OF WATER FOR ICE. IT REALLY MADE ME LEARN A LOT ABOUT MYSELF AND BECOME MORE CONFIDENT IN WHAT I DO. WELL, THIS IS ONE OF THE FUN PARTS OF WINTER IN THE HOUSEBOAT. YOU GOT TO DRILL ANYTIME YOU NEED WATER. I'M DEFINITELY A TOUGH NORTHERN GIRL. I'M NO GIRLY GIRL. I GOT WATER. BUT WE'VE GOT A LOT OF WORK AHEAD OF US. LESS THAN A MILE AWAY, ABOARD THE PHINN, "PIKE" MIKE HARRISON IS ALSO PREPARING TO STORE UP FOOD AND SUPPLIES FOR A LONG, HARD WINTER. HE'S AN EXPERT FISHERMAN SPECIALIZING IN NORTHERN PIKE, AND LIKE A TRUE NORTHERN REBEL, HE LIVES A SPARSE LIFE, FREE FROM SOCIETY'S TRAPPINGS. MY HOUSEBOAT IS THE SMALLEST FLOATING DWELLING ON THE BAY. I WAS INSISTENT ON THAT WHEN I DEVELOPED IT. I WANTED TO MAKE SURE I HAD A MICRO-DWELLING... LESS SPACE, LESS ENERGY. ALTHOUGH ICE FISHING IS A HOBBY IN SOME NORTHERN CLIMATES, HERE IN THE SUBARCTIC, WHERE YOUR BODY WORKS OVERTIME, BURNING 3,000 CALORIES A DAY JUST TO STAY WARM, THAT PROTEIN IS A NECESSITY. YOU KNOW, HERE WE ARE ON THIS VAST LAKE. AVERAGE TEMPERATURES ALL WINTER, YOU KNOW, MINUS-25, MINUS-30. YOU BUILD UP A LOT OF ICE. AND IT'S HARDER IN TERMS OF CATCHING FISH. MY IMPROVISED BAIT BUCKET, A WATER JUG. SO I THINK RIGHT NOW UNDER THE PRESENT TIME FRAME, THE BEST THING I CAN DO IS JUST GET EVERYTHING DONE NOW FOR MY OWN SUSTENANCE PURPOSES. EVEN THOUGH IT LOOKS LIKE I HAVE TIME, IF I DELAY, I'M INVITING DISASTER. LET'S GO CUT SOME WILLOWS. BE NEEDING THAT. A SURVIVALIST WHO PREFERS MAKING HIS OWN TOOLS, PIKE MIKE VENTURES INTO THE WOODS OF THE TINY ISLAND BEHIND HIS HOUSEBOAT TO GATHER FISHING SUPPLIES. LIVING ON YELLOWKNIFE BAY, IT'S CERTAINLY IMPORTANT TO HAVE AN INVENTORY OF SURVIVAL SKILLS. I'M LOOKING FOR A PARTICULAR FROND OF A PARTICULAR TYPE OF TREE, THE WILLOW. THESE ARE WILLOWS HERE. I BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT TO PRACTICE OFF-GRID LIVING. IF YOU GET OVERLY DEPENDENT ON THE SYNTHETIC STRUCTURE OF CIVILIZATION, WHAT HAPPENS IF THAT COLLAPSES? THEN WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO? THE ICE IS GOING ON THREE FEET THICK IN PLACES, SO I WANT A WILLOW LONG ENOUGH TO GET BELOW THE BOTTOM OF THE ICE AND STRONG ENOUGH TO HOLD THE LINE AND FLEXIBLE ENOUGH TO PLAY A FISH. IT'S A PRACTICE IN ALTERNATIVE LIVING, BECAUSE ONE DAY, IT'S LIKELY GOING TO BE NECESSARY FOR EVERYONE. THE WILLOW IS STRONG AND FLEXIBLE. FOR THOSE WHO ARE FISHERMEN USING FLEXIBLE RODS, THIS WILL JUST PRETTY MUCH AUTOMATICALLY PLAY THE FISH. WILLOW, THE MAGICAL WOOD. * AIN'T GOT NO LADY * LITTLE LONELY * AIN'T GOT NO FISHES * I WON'T HAVE TO DO THE DISHES * LOOKS NICE. GOOD. REAL GOOD WILLOW SET RIGHT THERE. GUIDE APPROVED. WELL, IT'S TIME TO GO FISHING. FIVE MILES WEST, NEAR THE MOUTH OF YELLOWKNIFE BAY, LOCAL NATIVE RANDY SIBBESTON, A DESCENDANT OF THE MéTIS TRIBE, ALSO FEELS TIME IS RUNNING OUT TO STOCK UP ON FOOD BEFORE THE SEVERE WINTER CONDITIONS CLOSE IN. GOOD. I HAVE HEALTHY, BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN AND A WONDERFUL FAMILY. WHY DON'T YOU TAKE OUT SOMETHING FOR SUPPER, STEPH? OKAY. AND MY JOB AS THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY IS TO PROVIDE FOOD AND COMFORT AND SECURITY FOR STEPHANIE AND THE KIDS. THERE'S NOT MUCH OUT THERE, RANDY. IS THAT ALL THERE WAS? IN THIS DAY AND AGE, WITH ALL OF THE STORE-BOUGHT MEAT, YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT YOU'RE EVEN GETTING. THERE'S A COUPLE OF GROUSE AND A RABBIT, AND THAT'S IT. COUNTRY FOODS LIKE CARIBOU AND FISH AND MOOSE AND RABBITS... THEY ALL MAKE UP A VERY HEALTHY DIET FOR THE KIDS AND THE FAMILY, AND I TAKE THAT JOB VERY SERIOUSLY. RIGHT. GOT THE STOVE, STOVEPIPE. WITH HIS MEAT SUPPLIES RUNNING LOW, RANDY ORGANIZES A CARIBOU HUNT. SNOWSHOES. AFTER HAVING SPENT A NUMBER OF DAYS IN THE FALL LOOKING FOR MOOSE WITHOUT SUCCESS, IT'S SO CRITICAL TO GET MOVING QUICKLY AND MAKE SURE THAT I HAD A GOOD STOCKPILE OF FRESH MEAT TO FEED MY FAMILY WITH. HUNTING BIG GAME LIKE CARIBOU OUT ON THE OPEN LAKE CAN TAKE DAYS, SO RANDY HAS TO STRIKE NOW BEFORE THE BLIZZARDS MOVE IN. SLEEPING BAGS, LANTERN. I'M NOT A SPORT HUNTER. I'M GOING OUT THERE FOR... IT'S A BUSINESS TRIP. I'M GOING OUT THERE TO HUNT TO HARVEST AND TO GET WHAT FOOD I NEED FOR THE YEAR. LOOKS LIKE EVERYTHING'S GOOD, BOBBY? THAT'S PRETTY SECURE. YEAH. NORTHERN WINTERS ARE VERY TOUGH THIS TIME OF YEAR. BASICALLY, IT'S EITHER GET MEAT OR YOU CAN BE IN TROUBLE. GUNS ARE READY. GUNS ARE READY TO GO. GUNS ARE LOADED. FOR THIS HUNT, RANDY HAS INVITED LIFELONG FRIEND BOBBY VILLONEUVE AND EDDIE CHOCOLATE, FORMER CHIEF OF THE NATIVE COMMUNITY OF GAMèTI. SETTING OUT FROM THE COASTAL ISLANDS NEAR THE BAY, RANDY AND HIS TEAM BEGIN THEIR TREK ACROSS THE 300-MILE-LONG LAKE, HOPING TO CATCH THE CARIBOU BY THE NORTHERN SHORES. RIGHT NOW WE'RE HEADED NORTH OF GAMèTI, WHICH IS WHERE THE BIG, BIG HERD OF CARIBOU IS RIGHT NOW. THE WINTER ICE IS STRONG ENOUGH TO SUPPORT VEHICLES AS HEAVY AS 18-WHEELERS, ALLOWING RANDY AND HIS TEAM TO SLED STRAIGHT ACROSS THE FROZEN LAKE. BUT LOCATING THE HERD ON THIS KILLER ICE LAKE AS BIG AS MASSACHUSETTS WITH WIND CHILLS OF 50 BELOW WON'T BE EASY. IT'S A LONG SKIDDOO RIDE, BUT WITH A GOOD WINDSHIELD ON MY MACHINE, I CAN JUST HIDE BEHIND IT, AND IT BREAKS THE WIND FOR ME. I HAVEN'T GOT ANY WINDBURN YET. YET FREEZING COLD ISN'T THIS LAKE'S ONLY TRAIT. IT'S ALSO THE MASTER OF THE CURVEBALL. OVER THE YEARS, I'VE SEEN A LOT OF SITUATIONS ARISE THAT YOU WOULD NEVER EXPECT. IT'S ALMOST LIKE THERE'S AN INEXHAUSTIBLE SUPPLY OF SURPRISES. JUST WHEN YOU THINK YOU'VE SEEN IT ALL, YOU DID IT ALL, SOMETHING COMPLETELY NEW COMES OUT OF THE BLUE AND CATCHES YOU OFF GUARD. AND ON THE GREAT SLAVE LAKE IN WINTERTIME, EVEN SOMETHING VERY SMALL CAN COST YOU YOUR LIFE. I CAME AROUND THE CORNER, AND THEN OUT OF NOWHERE, I COULD SMELL PLASTIC IN THE AIR... BURNING PLASTIC. BOBBY? CAUGHT ON FIRE. **** NOW MORE THAN 100 MILES FROM HOME AND WITH COLD DARKNESS DESCENDING ON THEM FAST, THIS FIRE COULD END THEIR HUNT AND FORCE THEM TO CAMP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LAKE WITHOUT SHELTER FROM THE ARCTIC WINDS. MY GOD, THIS IS JUST WORST-CASE SCENARIO. IN SUBARCTIC CANADA, ON THE OPEN EXPANSE OF GREAT SLAVE LAKE, WITH RANDY IN THE MIDST OF A CARIBOU HUNT, A SNOWMOBILE BURSTS INTO FLAMES. BOBBY? CAUGHT ON FIRE. **** THIS IS NO WAY TO START OUT A TRIP. IT'S NOT FIRING THROUGH. YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT CLEAR. IT'S THIS STUFF WHERE IT'S TOUCHING? A LONG TIME AGO, GOING OUT ON THE LAKE WAS A LITTLE BIT SAFER, I THINK. YOU KNOW, 50 YEARS AGO, PEOPLE WERE USING DOG TEAMS, AND THE DOGS WERE NOT INCLINED TO GET LOST, AND THEY WERE NOT INCLINED TO BREAK DOWN. FLIP IT ON THE SIDE THERE. I AM VERY CONCERNED. BEING OUT ON THE BIG LAKE'S AN INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS PLACE TO BE IN THE WINTERTIME. YOU'VE GOT INCREDIBLY COLD WEATHER, AND THAT WIND JUST SAPS THE WARMTH AND IT SAPS THE MOISTURE FROM YOUR BODY, AND I TAKE THAT VERY SERIOUSLY. RIGHT NOW, EVERY MINUTE IS PRECIOUS. WITH TEMPERATURES DROPPING FAST AND THE TEAM NOWHERE NEAR CIVILIZATION, THEIR ONLY RESOURCE IS NORTHERN INGENUITY. WHEN YOU'RE LIVING OFF THE GRID AND THERE'S NOBODY AROUND FOR MILES AND MILES, YOU HAVE TO MAKE GOOD USE OUT OF THE THINGS THAT ARE AROUND YOU. I THINK THAT MIGHT BE ALL IT TAKES JUST TO KEEP IT COOL ENOUGH TO PREVENT THAT PLASTIC FROM IGNITING AGAIN. INCREDIBLE. FALLING HALF A DAY BEHIND SCHEDULE, THEIR DETERMINATION PUTS THEM BACK ON TRACK. BUT WITH THE HERD ON THE MOVE, THEY HOPE THERE'S STILL TIME TO CATCH THE CARIBOU. BACK IN YELLOWKNIFE BAY... FISH FRY TONIGHT! ...STEPHAN IS HOPING TO CATCH HIS PROTEIN CLOSER TO HOME. ALLYCE AND I ARE GETTING MARRIED IN THE SPRING, AND WE NEED TO SAVE MONEY BY ANY MEANS THAT WE CAN. GREAT SLAVE IS FULL OF FISH. I SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET ALL THE FISH I NEED JUST ON OUR OWN. SO, LET'S CUT A HOLE. YOU GOT IT, BROTHER. LET'S PUT ONE RIGHT... ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THOSE TREES? YEAH. LET'S PUT ONE IN THERE. RIGHT ON. WHY NOT? START IT OFF. I'LL DO THE PUSH DOWN, AND YOU SPIN. I WANT TO FISH CLOSE TO HOME, WHERE THERE'S A SAFETY NET. ALMOST THERE. GOING FURTHER OUT ON GREAT SLAVE IS VERY DANGEROUS. THERE ARE NO SAFE SPOTS. I DON'T KNOW THE ICE CONDITIONS, THE CURRENTS, AND IF THE WIND CHANGES, BRINGING IN STORMS, I'D BE DONE. LUCKILY, I CAN CATCH FISH JUST OUTSIDE MY FRONT DOOR. GOOD CALL, MIKE. AND I WANT YOU TO DO THIS. JUST TAKE IT BY HAND AND LET HER GO DOWN TO THE BOTTOM, AND WE'RE GONNA DETERMINE WHERE THE BOTTOM IS. BOMBS AWAY! GENTLY. YEAH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT. NOW, GRAB YOUR WILLOW THERE. PUT THE END IN DOWN IN. WOW. AND NOW LOCK IT IN THERE. BEAUTIFUL. YOU THINK THE FISH IS SMART ENOUGH TO BUMP THE BOTTOM OF THE STICK? NO, NO. FORGET IT. GUESS WHAT? THIS IS 7,000-YEAR-OLD SURVIVAL TECHNOLOGY, RIGHT? NOW BURY THAT. BURY IT DARN GOOD? BURY IT, SET IT, AND FORGET IT. NOW, AS YOU SEE, WE'VE PACKED THE SNOW AROUND THE HANDLE. SO IF YOU COME AND CHECK THIS HOLE, OKAY, RIGHT NOW IT'S LIKE THIS. IT SHOULD BE UNDISTURBED. IF YOU COME IN HERE, AND IT LOOKS LIKE THAT... I GOT A FISH ON. ...YOU GOT A FISH ON. I CAN'T WAIT TO CATCH SOME FISH, BROTHER! GONNA CATCH SOME FISH! KEEP IT CLOSE. IF THIS TECHNIQUE WORKS AND WE START PULLING A LOT OF FISH, POSSIBLY EVENTUALLY, ALLYCE AND I COULD MAKE SOME MONEY DOING THIS. NOW IT'S JUST THE WAITING GAME. DO YOU WANT ME TO START ON THE NEXT HOLE, THEN? SAME THING. OKAY. 200 MILES TO THE NORTHWEST, RANDY SIBBESTON IS ON THE SECOND DAY OF HIS CARIBOU HUNT, HOPING TO SECURE ENOUGH FRESH MEAT TO FEED HIS FAMILY FOR THE WINTER. AFTER HAVING HUNTED CARIBOU FOR SO MANY YEARS, YOU TRY TO THINK THE WAY A CARIBOU WOULD THINK, THINK WHAT DOES THAT CARIBOU NEED AND WHAT DOES THAT CARIBOU WANT? THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A HUNTER AND HIS PREY, IT LENDS ITSELF TO RESPECT AND UNDERSTANDING. FINALLY, THEY TRACK THE HERD DOWN BY FOLLOWING A WELL-KNOWN WINTER MIGRATION PATH. AT THIS POINT, IT'S GETTING LATE, AND WE WERE GOING TO BE LOSING OUR DAYLIGHT. SO WE JUST HAVE A BRIEF MEETING THERE AND AGREED THAT WE WERE GONNA SPLIT UP, AND BOBBY AND EDDIE WERE GONNA GO START SETTING UP CAMP, AND I'D GO AFTER THE CARIBOU AND SEE IF I COULD GET SOME FRESH MEAT FOR SUPPER. NOW, WHENEVER YOU'RE HEADING TOWARDS CARIBOU, YOU NEVER WANT TO HEAD STRAIGHT FOR THEM. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT NOT TO FRIGHTEN THE CARIBOU, BECAUSE IF IT COMES DOWN TO THEM RUNNING, THEY'LL BEAT YOU EVERY TIME. YOU SIMPLY CANNOT OUTMANEUVER CARIBOU ON AN OPEN LAKE. 200 MILES NORTH OF YELLOWKNIFE BAY, ON THE VAST, FROZEN EXPANSE OF GREAT SLAVE LAKE, RANDY SIBBESTON SETS HIS SIGHTS ON CARIBOU HE'S TRACKED FOR TWO DAYS THAT WILL PROVIDE HIS FAMILY WITH FRESH MEAT FOR THE WINTER. AFTER I GET A LITTLE BIT CLOSER, I START SIZING THE HERD UP. I'M LOOKING FOR THAT ONE ANIMAL THAT HAS AN ADULT THAT'S NOT CARRYING A CALF, AND THAT IS THE ONE THAT WILL NORMALLY CARRY THE MOST FAT AND WILL PROVIDE THE MOST ENERGY IN THE FOOD. I SHOT TWO WITH ONE SHOT. TURNS OUT THERE WAS ONE CARIBOU STANDING BEHIND THE ONE THAT I SHOT AT, SO I WOUND UP SHOOTING TWO OF THEM WITH ONE SHOT. I WAS A LITTLE BIT WORRIED THAT I MIGHT HAVE SHOT THE ONE BEHIND POORLY... YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE LEGS OR IN A BAD SPOT. BUT AS IT TURNED OUT, BOTH WERE GOOD, CLEAN SHOTS. I'M VERY THANKFUL. NOW I HAVE A FREEZER FULL OF CARIBOU MEAT, AND STEPHANIE AND THE KIDS ARE GONNA BE WELL FED. I'M QUITE HAPPY. BACK IN YELLOWKNIFE BAY, A MASSIVE FLOATING COMMERCIAL FISH PLANT WEIGHING ALMOST 1 MILLION POUNDS IS HOME TO ITS OWNERS, FISHERMEN BRIAN ABBOTT AND HENRY JEWER. HEY, HENRY, HOW'S IT GOING? PRETTY GOOD. HENRY AND I ARE PARTNERS TOGETHER AT THE FISH PLANT. I GO OUT, SET THE NETS, BRING IN THE FISH. HENRY FILLETS IT AND DELIVERS IT ALL TO THE CUSTOMERS. WE'LL DO ONE MORE TONIGHT, AND THEN I'LL GET A COUPLE MORE IN THE MORNING AND THEN COME IN. FISHING UP IN THE NORTH HERE IS BASICALLY A BATTLE AGAINST NATURE. IT'S ENOUGH TO KILL A PERSON DAY AFTER DAY. NICE CONEY, TOO. I ALMOST DIED IN 2006. COULDN'T BE ANY CLOSER. I GOT A LITTLE BURN ON MY FINGERS FROM A MUFFLER. "OH!" BIG BLISTER ON IT. KEPT WORKING. DIDN'T THINK ANYTHING ABOUT IT. POPPED THE BLISTER, GOT DIRT IN IT. IN LESS THAN A HUNDRED HOURS, I WAS UNCONSCIOUS. STAPH AUREUS GOT INTO MY HEART AND ENDOCARDITIS. THIS YOU'RE ROTTING FROM THE INSIDE OUT. IT'S GOING THROUGH EVERY CELL EVERYWHERE, AND I LOST A BUNCH OF MY BIG TOE, AND NONE OF MY BODY WORKS VERY WELL ANYMORE. WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO? LAY ON THE COUCH? I'VE NEVER LAID ON THE COUCH. BETTER TO BE DOING SOMETHING THAN NOTHING, SO... THAT'S THE SMALLEST ONE. THEY OPERATE 20 HOURS A DAY EVERY DAY, TRYING TO PROVIDE THE LOCAL COMMUNITY WITH ONE OF THE FEW PROTEINS AVAILABLE ON THE LAKE. ME AND BRIAN RUN THE WHOLE OPERATION BY OURSELVES. WE'RE ONE OF THE MAIN SUPPLIERS OF THE NORTHWEST TERRITORIES. A COUPLE MORE LIKE THAT IN THERE. EVERYTHING'S ALL DOLLAR SIGNS OUT THERE. THE FISH MEANS DOLLARS. BUT WINTER CAME IN HERE PRETTY FAST, AND WHEN THE LAKE IS FROZEN, THERE'S A BIG STRUGGLE. I CAN USE A HELL OF A LOT MORE FISH THAN WHAT I'M GETTING. RIGHT NOW, WE'RE LOOKING AT PROBABLY ABOUT $2,000 EVERY DAY WE'RE LOSING ON AVERAGE. A LOT OF PEOPLE RELY ON US. STILL NOT NEAR ENOUGH WHITEFISH. YEAH. NOT NEAR ENOUGH. THAT'S DEPRESSING. THIS THING SHOULD BE FULL. IT SHOULD BE FULL. I GOT MAYBE ABOUT SIX FISH IN THIS AND PROBABLY ABOUT NINE FISH IN HERE, AND THAT'S IT. TO CATCH MORE FISH, BRIAN AND HENRY WILL NEED TO DOUBLE DOWN AND BRING IN SOME HEAVY EQUIPMENT AND EXTRA HANDS. WELL, I'M GONNA PICK UP THAT AUGER SO I CAN GET SOME MORE NETS IN. AND SHEILA'S GONNA BE STARTING HERE TONIGHT, SO THAT WILL GIVE US A CHANCE, WE CAN DOUBLE AND TRIPLE WHAT WE'VE BEEN BRINGING IN. WE NEED TO GET IT FILLED UP A.S.A.P., YEAH. EVERYTHING. WITH SUPPLIES RUNNING LOW AT THE FISH PLANT... COME HERE, DORA. WANT TO GO SEE THE FISHY, PUP? ...STEPHAN AND ALLYCE BRAVE THE DARK, MINUS-40-DEGREE CONDITIONS TO CHECK THEIR OWN FISHING LINES. IT'S A GAME! BACK. DON'T FALL IN THE HOLE. NOW, IF WE'RE LUCKY... I CAN FEEL SOMETHING WENT DOWN. OUR FIRST LINE DIDN'T HOOK ANY FISH AT ALL. OKAY, HON, YOU WANT TO WRAP THIS AROUND HERE? I'LL GO CHECK THE OTHER HOLE. NO FISH. THIS REALLY ISN'T AS EASY AS PIKE MIKE SAID IT WAS. I'M JUST GONNA RESET THE LINE NOW, SO I'M GONNA TAKE IT ALL OUT AND THEN PUT IT DOWN AGAIN, JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S ALL NOT TANGLED UP DOWN THERE. NO. NO FISH TODAY. BUT WE'LL TRY AGAIN TONIGHT AND MIGHT GET LUCKY. THIS IS GREAT SLAVE LAKE, AND ALTHOUGH YOU'VE GOT A TECHNIQUE THAT'S WORKED FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS, YOU CAN STILL BE THWARTED. SO I'VE GOT TO GO TO DEEPER WATER, 'CAUSE THE FISH HAVE OBVIOUSLY MOVED ON. AND I HATE TO GO TOO FAR FROM HOME, 'CAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT CAN HAPPEN OUT THERE. WHAT IF A BLIZZARD COMES IN? WHAT IF WOLVES COME AT ME? I AM SO FAR AND SO REMOTE THAT THAT UPS THE ANTE. IT'S A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT. I'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO CATCH SOME FISH TO SURVIVE WINTER. COMING UP... NO! SON OF A BITCH. IF THIS THING FREEZES IN THE HOLE, I'LL NEVER GET IT OUT OF THERE. IN THE NORTHEAST CORNER OF GREAT SLAVE LAKE, WHERE OVERNIGHT TEMPERATURES HOVER AT MINUS-40 DEGREES AND ARE EXPECTED TO REACH MINUS-50 IN THE COMING WEEKS, HOUSEBOATERS CONTINUE THEIR SEARCH FOR FISH AND WILD GAME BEFORE THE LACK OF WINTER DAYLIGHT MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE. THIS WINTER'S JUST KIND OF DROPPED ON US? I'M GONNA MAKE SURE THE FIRE'S GETTING GOOD, 'CAUSE IT'S COLD IN HERE. WITH THEIR ICE-FISHING LINES COMING UP EMPTY IN THE BAY, STEPHAN AND ALLYCE ARE EXPLORING WAYS TO FISH THE FAR REACHES OF THE LAKE SO THEY CAN STOCK UP ON FOOD FOR THE WINTER. I'LL MAKE SOME TEA FOR US. OKAY. YEAH! THAT FEELS GOOD, BABE. IF THE FIANCéS CATCH ENOUGH FISH, THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO SAVE SOME MONEY AND POSSIBLY SELL WHAT THEY DON'T EAT TO THE COMMUNITY. ME AND ALLYCE... WE'RE PLANNING A SPRING WEDDING ON THE ISLAND. WE'RE GONNA MAKE THIS THE BEST, MOST SPECIAL WEDDING EVER. WE'RE DOING IT OURSELVES, BUT IT STILL REQUIRES A LOT OF MONEY. WEDDINGS ARE NOT CHEAP, SO I'VE GOT THIS PLAN. ALLYCE HATES THAT WHEN I SAY THAT. BUT I'VE GOT THIS PLAN. I WANT TO START A FISH CAMP. A FISH CAMP? WELL, I CALL IT A FISH CAMP. BACK HOME, THEY'D CALL IT AN ICE HUT. SO JUST A SPOT WHERE WE CAN GO FISHING AND CATCH OUR OWN DINNERS? NO. WE'RE THINKING MONEY HERE, RIGHT? YEAH. THE POINT OF HAVING A FISH CAMP IS I DON'T HAVE TO DRIVE BACK AND FORTH EVERY DAY. I CAN GO OUT THERE FOR THREE DAYS. IT'S MY SETUP. IT'S MY BASE. I'M SAVING MONEY ON GAS. IT'S ALL ABOUT THE BOTTOM LINE RIGHT NOW. SO, GET A COMMERCIAL FISHING LICENSE, PROSPECTOR TENT, WOOD STOVE, I'M IN BUSINESS. PIKE MIKE'S METHOD OF FISHING DIDN'T REALLY WORK OUT FOR US. BUT NOW STEPH'S GOT ALL THESE CRAZY IDEAS ABOUT ICE FISHING FOR A LIVING. I'VE LEARNED OVER THE YEARS THAT TO MANAGE STEPH, SOMETIMES YOU JUST HAVE TO TAKE A STEP BACK. FIRST, YOU START WITH YOUR FRIENDS, AND THEN YOUR FRIENDS TELL A FRIEND. IT'S NETWORK MARKETING. I LOVE STEPH'S IDEAS, BUT HE DOESN'T KEEP ANY THOUGHT INSIDE. SO MY ROLE IN THE RELATIONSHIP IS HELP HIM TALK THROUGH IT. YOU KNOW ME. I LOVE PEOPLE, HON. THAT'S WHO I AM. I WAS BORN TO CONNECT WITH HUMANITY. SOMETIMES, YOU ALSO HAVE TO JUST FOCUS HIM. HOW ARE YOU GONNA GET TO THE FISH CAMP EVERY DAY? 'CAUSE, LIKE, WE STARTED THAT A WAYS OUT. IT WILL COST A FAIR BIT. I FREAKING TOTALLY SKIPPED THE BIGGEST PART OF ALL OF THIS. I GOT A LEAD ON A SLED. WE CAN'T REALLY AFFORD TO BUY A SLED AT THIS POINT. IT'S WORTH DOUBLE THAN WHAT HE'S ASKING, AND I KNOW I CAN GET HIM DOWN TO HALF BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT HE'S GOT TO GET IT GONE AND THE FACT THAT IT DOESN'T RUN. SO IT'S NOT WORKING? IT'S NOT RUNNING TODAY. BUT, I MEAN, I CAN FIX PRACTICALLY ANYTHING GIVEN ENOUGH TIME. I'VE GOT A SOLID PLAN TO CATCH FISH. I GOT A FISH CAMP 50 MILES OUT. THE FISH ARE THERE. THEY'RE DEEP. I'LL HAVE ENOUGH TO FILL UP MY FREEZER AND DEFINITELY HAVE ENOUGH FOR THE WEDDING. ALL I NEED TO DO IS BUY THAT SNOWMOBILE, GET IT FIXED. I COULD FIX THAT THING, SELL IT THE NEXT DAY FOR DOUBLE WHAT I'M PAYING FOR IT. FOR SURE? I'VE CHECKED THIS OUT, HON. OKAY. TRUST ME. SOMETIMES YOU GET EXCITED. SO WE'RE GOOD? I CAN GO GRAB THAT SLED, START THERE? OKAY. GO GET THE SLED. SEE? SOLD IT TO YOU. YOU'RE A TOUGH CUSTOMER, PAL, TRUST ME. 20 MILES TO THE SOUTHEAST, NEAR THE COASTLINE OF THE LAKE... I HOPE WE GET A LOT OF TROUT IN THIS SPOT. ...FISHERMAN BRIAN HEADS OUT IN AN EFFORT TO CATCH MORE FISH FOR HIS UNDERSTOCKED FISH PLANT. TO HELP HIM CATCH UP, BRIAN HAS HIRED FISHERWOMAN SHEILA FRISE. MY NAME IS SHEILA. I'VE BEEN FISHING THESE LAKES SINCE I WAS 12. I LOVE ICE FISHING. I LEARNED A LOT FISHING ALL THESE YEARS, AND I'M A BADASS FISHERWOMAN. RIGHT AROUND DOWN IN HERE. RIGHT HERE? YEAH. RIGHT IN FRONT OF IT. SO FAR THIS SEASON, BRIAN HAS CHISELED HIS HOLES THROUGH THE ICE BY HAND, TAKING HOURS TO SET A SINGLE NET. DESPERATE TO CATCH ENOUGH FISH BEFORE WINTER'S EXTREME WEATHER ENVELOPES THE LAKE, BRIAN HAS BROUGHT THEIR LAST HOPE TO SAVE THE CRUMBLING BUSINESS... A MECHANICAL AUGER. THE MECHANICAL AUGER BASICALLY IS LIKE A SCREW... A VERY LARGE SCREW. IT'S GOT A MOTOR THAT DOES THE TURNING. IT'S GOT A CUTTING EDGE ON IT AND A SHARP POINT IN THE MIDDLE TO KEEP IT CENTERED. AND AS IT TURNS, IT SHAVES OFF A LAYER OF ICE EVERY TURN THAT IT GOES. A LOT OF MONEY INVESTED, AND WE'D REALLY LIKE TO GET THIS THING MAKING SOME MONEY LIKE IT CAN. THE AUGER WILL DRILL HOLES THROUGH THE ICE FASTER, ALLOWING BRIAN AND SHEILA TO SET MORE NETS IN A SINGLE DAY. WE'LL JUST DIG A HOLE RIGHT HERE? YEAH. RIGHT. WELL, LET'S SEE IF THIS SUCKER WORKS OR NOT. WELL, IT'S FIRING. COME ON, YOU. COME ON, YOU. RIGHT ON, YEAH. I WAS SO HAPPY, I FELT JUST JUBILATION. NOW WE CAN SEE HOW MANY NETS WE CAN GET PUT IN JUST HOW FAST. THIS AUGER'S AMAZING. IT'S FAST COMPARED TO MANUAL. WE'LL GET THESE FREEZERS FULL IN NO TIME. NO. WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED? MAN, WE DON'T NEED THIS RIGHT NOW. WE WERE MAKING GOOD PROGRESS WITH THE AUGER IN THE HOLE, AND IT JUST SUDDENLY DIED. AND YOU'VE GOT A WIND WHISTLING, AND YOU'RE BELOW FREEZING TEMPERATURES, AND THINGS WILL START FREEZING SO QUICKLY, IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. I KNOW. IN THESE TEMPERATURES, IT WILL TAKE MINUTES FOR THE NEWLY DUG HOLE TO REFREEZE AROUND THE SCREW HEAD OF THE AUGER, RENDERING THEIR $4,000 INVESTMENT WORTHLESS. IF THIS THING FREEZES SOLID IN THIS SLUSH HOLE HERE, WE'LL NEVER GET THE THING OUT OF HERE. IF WE CAN'T FIX THIS AUGER, LIKE, RIGHT NOW, WE'RE GONNA BE IN BIG TROUBLE. THIS IS NOT GOOD. NOT GOOD AT ALL. 20 MILES SOUTHEAST OF YELLOWKNIFE BAY, ON THE FROZEN EXPANSE OF GREAT SLAVE LAKE, BRIAN AND SHEILA ARE ATTEMPTING TO KEEP THEIR BUSINESS AFLOAT BY CATCHING MORE FISH USING A NEWLY PURCHASED POWER AUGER. BUT DRILLING THROUGH SIX FEET OF ICE IN MINUS-30-DEGREE CONDITIONS HAS LOCKED UP THE AUGER'S ENGINE. I'M HEATING THIS MACHINE UP WITH A TORCH IN ORDER TO GET IT STARTED ALL. WITH THIS WIND, I'M NOT SURE IF I'M EVEN GONNA GET IT HOT ENOUGH TO START. IT'S OKAY. I DON'T WANT TO WARP ANYTHING. IF HE DOESN'T GET THE ENGINE STARTED SOON, THE SCREWHEAD WILL BE PERMANENTLY ENCASED INSIDE THE ICE. AND BRIAN MAY BE FORCED TO CLOSE HIS FISH PLANT. MY GOD. I HOPE IT'S NOT FROZEN IN THERE. THEY SAY HELL IS HOT. I DISAGREE. I'VE BEEN THERE. IT'S COLD. **** SON OF A BITCH. IF THIS THING FREEZES IN THE HOLE LIKE THIS, I'LL NEVER GET IT OUT OF THERE. I GOT TO MAKE IT WORK RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW, AND FAST. WELL, KEEP YOUR FINGERS CROSSED. OKAY. COME ON... IT PROBABLY COOLED DOWN WHILE WE'RE FIDDLING WITH IT. AS THE WIND PICKS UP SPEED, THE WIND CHILL DROPS TO MINUS-50. STARTING TO FREEZE UP. AND HERE, ON THIS UNFORGIVING LAKE, WITH NO SHELTER FOR MILES, BRIAN MAY HAVE TO DECIDE BETWEEN HIS LIFE OR HIS LIVELIHOOD. FLAME'S BLOWING SIDEWAYS, THERE'S SO MUCH WIND HERE. JUST A STEADY BLOW. I'VE BEEN FISHING ON THIS LAKE SINCE I WAS 12 YEARS OLD, AND THIS IS THE COLDEST CONDITION I EVER FISHED IN IN MY LIFE. NO FISHERMAN'S GONNA FISH IN WEATHER THAT BRIAN GOES IN... LIKE NOBODY. HERE. COME ON. YOU GOT TO RUN. COME ON. YEAH! YAY! WHOO! RIGHT ON! NOW, THIS IS A MOMENT OF CELEBRATION. THE THING STARTED UP. WE CAN FINISH THIS HOLE. WHEN I SAW THIS WATER COME UP OUT OF THE HOLE, WE KNEW WE MADE IT, AND WE HAVE A LONG ENOUGH AUGER SHAFT HERE TO ACTUALLY GET THROUGH. NOW THAT THEY'VE STRUCK WATER, THEY'LL THREAD A BOARD CALLED A JIGGER UNDER THE ICE TO HELP THEM SET THEIR NETS. WHEN YOU PULL ON THE ROPE HERE, IT YANKS THIS COUNTERWEIGHT AND SHOVES THIS ARM UP INTO THE ICE, SHOVING THE THING FORWARD. YOU GET ABOUT A FOOT ROUGHLY EVERY TIME YOU PULL ON THE ROPE, SO YOU GOT ABOUT 300 FEET OF NET. ATTACHED TO THE JIGGER IS A SMALL LIGHT. AND AS BRIAN PUSHES THE DEVICE ALONG, SHEILA USES THE LIGHT TO TRACK ITS LOCATION ABOVE THE ICE. ALMOST DONE. ONCE THE JIGGER HAS REACHED A SPOT WHERE THE ROPE IS TAUT, THEY WILL DIG A NEW HOLE, RETRIEVE THE JIGGER, AND ATTACH A NET TO THE ROPE. I THINK WE'RE ABOUT GOOD THERE. I DON'T LIKE TO WORK ANY LONGER THAN I HAVE TO IN THESE TEMPERATURES, 'CAUSE IT'S REALLY EASY TO GET FROSTBITE. THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO GET THIS OUT NOW. THIS WIND IS BRUTAL. YES! IT'S HARD DOING IT BY HAND. THIS IS WAY FASTER, AND I'M NOT SWEATING. NORMALLY, I'M JUST SOAKED WITH SWEAT RIGHT NOW. AND WITH THIS WIND, SWEATING IS NOT GOOD OUT HERE. YOU GET COLD VERY, VERY QUICKLY. WE'RE GETTING CLOSE. YES! WHOO! TONIGHT WAS ONE HELL OF A NIGHT, BUT EVENTUALLY, THE AUGER DID DELIVER. AND A NICE, BIG HOLE THIS MAKES. YEAH. ISN'T THAT BEAUTIFUL? YEAH. THIS MACHINE WILL BE THE TURNING POINT FOR US. WE'LL LEAVE THESE NETS DOWN FOR A FEW DAYS. SO, YOU KNOW, AS LONG AS THE AUGER KEEPS WORKING AND THE FISH ARE IN THE NETS, WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO FILL THESE FREEZERS IN NO TIME. THAT SHOULD DO IT NOW. FINALLY. AS DAWN BREAKS ACROSS THE FROZEN LAKE, IN YELLOWKNIFE BAY, TEMPERATURES CONTINUE TO PLUMMET. FIANCéS STEPHAN AND ALLYCE ARE READY TO TRY THEIR NEWLY-PURCHASED SNOWMOBILE FOR THE DANGEROUS TREK OUT ON THE OPEN LAKE BEFORE CONDITIONS GET ANY WORSE. YOU READY TO CATCH SOME FISH? LET'S DO THIS. WAIT TILL YOU SEE THE SLED. I THINK YOU'RE GONNA BE IMPRESSED WITH MY PURCHASE. SHE'S AN OLDIE, BUT SHE'S A GOLDIE. THIS BEAUTY... IT'S GONNA TURN HEADS. PEOPLE ARE GONNA GO, "WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?" AS I'M ZOOMING BY! HOW OLD IS THAT THING? IT'S ACTUALLY JUST ABOUT THE SAME AGE AS YOU. WHEN I WALK OUT AND SEE THE SNOW MACHINE FOR THE FIRST TIME, MY FIRST REACTION WAS "THIS IS NOT GONNA WORK." DOES IT RUN? IT WILL RUN. I GOT THIS, BABY. I GOT THIS. I GOT THE GUY DOWN TO 30% OF HIS ASKING PRICE. I GOT A GREAT, DEPENDABLE SLED. ALL RIGHT. WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS PRIME IT THREE TIMES. 1, 2, 3. PULL TWO, THREE TIMES, AND YOU'RE GOOD. ALL RIGHT. ONE TO GO THERE. I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING. YOU GO IN THE HOUSE. YOU STAY WARM. MAKE SURE WE DIDN'T FORGET ANYTHING. I'LL PULL THE SPARK PLUGS OUT, WARM THEM UP. WE'LL BE READY TO GO, MAX, 10, 20 MINUTES. WHATEVER YOU SAY. IN 20 MINUTES, WE'RE OUT OF HERE. STEPH THINKS THAT WE'RE GOING IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE TO GO ICE FISHING WITH THIS THING? I DON'T THINK SO. SEE YOU IN A FEW HOURS. IT'S MAN VERSUS MACHINE, AND MAN WILL ALWAYS WIN. I'M GONNA NEED MY TOOLS. ON THE NORTHERN SHORES OF GREAT SLAVE LAKE, WHERE DAWN TEMPERATURES ARE MINUS-35 AND DROPPING FAST, RANDY HAS MANAGED TO SECURE ONE VITAL PROVISION FOR WINTER... MEAT FOR HIS FAMILY. FIVE CARIBOU BETWEEN THEM WILL BE ENOUGH PROTEIN FOR THEIR FAMILIES FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS. THIS IS MY FAVORITE. I LOVE CARIBOU FAT. THAT FAT IS LOADED WITH NUTRITION. THE MOST ENJOYABLE TIME OF A HUNT IS AFTER ALL YOUR HARD WORK IS DONE, AND YOU CAN JUST ENJOY THE FIRE AND RELAX AND COOK YOURSELF SOME FOOD. THIS IS A WELCOME MEAL AFTER A LONG TRIP ON THE SKI-DOO, I'LL TELL YOU. IT MAKES THE ADVERSITY... IT MAKES IT ALL WORTH IT, AND IT MAKES IT ALL JUST MELT AWAY. OKAY, THIS IS COOKED. DEFINITELY COOKED. AWESOME IT'S MY FAVORITE THING, BECAUSE YOU GET THE CHANCE TO SIT BACK AND SHARE STORIES WITH THE PEOPLE WHO YOU'RE WITH. I FEEL A REAL SENSE OF ACCOMPLISHMENT AND PEACE AND ENJOYMENT AND JUST HAPPINESS, YOU KNOW? HOLY MAN. THAT HAPPINESS IS... THAT HAPPINESS IS GOLDEN. LIVING OUT ON THE LAKE, IT MAKES US WEALTHY PEOPLE. IN THE CHANNEL OF YELLOWKNIFE BAY... ...AFTER SPENDING MOST OF THEIR SAVINGS ON A USED SNOWMOBILE TO FISH THE OUTER REACHES OF THE LAKE, STEPHAN'S SLED WON'T START. COME ON, BETSY. COME ON, BETSY. NOW HE'S TRYING TO GET HIS MACHINE RUNNING. OKAY. IS IT EVEN GETTING FUEL? HOW'S IT GOING OUT HERE? IT'S GOING. YOU GONNA GET IT GOING OR... I DEDUCED A COUPLE OF THINGS. STEPH... HE FOUND THIS SNOWMOBILE, THIS GREAT DEAL, SO HE COULDN'T PASS IT UP. WE MIGHT HAVE A BREACHED LINE. HE LIKES TO THINK HE CAN FIX ANYTHING. SO, HOPEFULLY HE CAN. BUT TO ME, IT JUST LOOKS LIKE A PIECE... WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S FOR PARTS. LOOK AT THAT. ALL YOUR TROUBLES ARE OVER, SWEETIE. THIS IS THE MOMENT. THE PIèCE DE RéSISTANCE. I SEE THE FUEL GOING UP THE LINE. YES! WHY?! IS THAT JUST CAUSE OF THE LITTLE AMOUNT OF GAS IN THERE? YEAH. IT'S NOT SUCKING UP THE GAS. IF THERE'S NO FUEL COMING UP THE LINE AND IT NEEDS TO GET SUCTION, YOU TAKE FUEL, YOU PUT IT IN THE CYLINDERS. I DIDN'T HAVE A HOSE. OKAY, THIS IS NOT SOMETHING I WOULD SUGGEST ANYBODY TO DO. BOY. THERE'S MY VESSEL. THIS IS NOT GONNA TASTE GOOD AT ALL. NO. DON'T DO THAT. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA DO, DON'T YOU? MAN, MAN, MAN, MAN. IT'S GAS-SUCKING TIME. YOU'RE NOT GONNA WANT TO KISS ME FOR A WHILE. BOY. YEAH, I'M FILLING UP THE LINE. I CAN HEAR IT. THE LINE IS FULL. LAST CHANCE, BABY. THIS IS IT? THIS IS IT. ONE LAST TRY, BABE. ONE LAST TRY. LET'S GIVE IT ALL WE'VE GOT. YEAH. YES, YES! YEAH! HIGH FIVE! YEAH, YEAH! WHEN I HEARD THAT SLED ROAR, I KNEW IT WAS "GO" TIME. MIGHT HAVE WASTED A DAY, BUT I DIDN'T WASTE THE INVESTMENT MONEY. YEAH! NEVER DOUBT ME! YEAH, YEAH! I TOLD YOU YOU WOULD RUN! I TOLD YOU YOU WOULD RUN! THERE'S NO WAY I WOULD LAST AS A HOUSEBOATER IF I DIDN'T BELIEVE I COULD DO THINGS THAT I'VE NEVER DONE BEFORE. I MEAN, LOOK, I FIXED THAT SLED. BUT YOU HAVE TO BE PREPARED, BECAUSE THE LAKE IS NOT FORGIVING. AW **** REALLY?!
