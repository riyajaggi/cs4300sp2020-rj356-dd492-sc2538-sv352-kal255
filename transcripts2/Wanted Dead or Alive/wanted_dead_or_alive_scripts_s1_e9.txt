 Randall is hired to escort a suspected triple murderer on a three-day journey back to town to stand trial and an almost certain hanging. What Randall didn't anticipate was the prisoner being a beautiful young woman who insists she's innocent of the three killings.

It's in stall 4. - Looks like an old poster. - Yeah, it is. How old? Two years. Was Sam Gladstone elected sheriff of Apam?

 Yeah. He's still sheriff there, as far as I know. How far's Apam from here? Just across the river. Much obliged. Thank you. Hey, mister! You're heading the wrong direction for Canyontown. Changed my mind. Going to Apam. THE FOURTH HEADSTONE Draw! Why, it can't be! Well, it is. Josh... Josh Randall. - How you been, Sam? - Fine! How 'bout you?

 Got no complaints. Bet it's 3 years since we saw each other. More like 4. The Webster case. You were in Tombstone. That's right. Say, how d'you find me? Saw an old election poster in Midvale right across the river. I'm certainly glad to see you. I really am. Here, Sam. You might need this. Sam, I thought you might wanna see this right away. "Jackie Harris captured in North Springs. "Being held pending your arrival." Any answer? I'll send someone first thing tomorrow. Right. What's up? I'm to pick up a prisoner in North Springs, but I've no one to send. - What about your deputies? - I need every one of 'em. We're expecting a rough trail-herd in a few days. - How far's North Springs? - Why? I'll go for you. For a deputy's pay. You'll come out short, Josh. It's a 3-day trip each way. Besides, the budget won't stand it. You can owe me. I get to keep the reputation. I ought to be polite and refuse your offer. But I can't afford to. - You got the job, on one condition. - What's that? You gotta take a tour with me before you go. - Tour of what? - You'll see. Come on. Read those and read 'em good. "Here lies Will Backer, "born April 5, 1827, died September 7, 1877." "Arthur Backer, born June 12, 1822, died September 7, 1877." "Henry Thompson, born December 17, 1845, died..." They all died the same day. Same hour. Only the inscriptions should read "killed", not "died". - Who did the killing? - Jackie Harris. - Prisoner I'm picking up. - That's her. - Her? - Yep. That's why you're here. Don't underestimate her like those fellows did. Art and Will Backer had a big ranch. They were middle-aged bachelors. Brothers? Yep. No one thought they'd ever marry. Then Will went to Oklahoma City. Came back married to Jackie Harris. Some say he found her in a dance-hall but we never heard for sure. - How did this come about? Living out in the country with Art and Will, Jackie got bored. Took up with the foreman. That third grave's his. - Henry Thompson? - Right. One day, Will found them together. Jackie shot Will. When Art came to help Will, she shot him too. Then as he'd witnessed the first murders, she went and shot Henry Thompson. Nice story. Thought you'd like it. How d'you hear about it? Henry Thompson, just before he died. I went to arrest her, but she'd already gone. - Well, what do you think? - 'Bout what? Going to North Springs to get her. Still wanna go through with it? - Wouldn't miss it for the world. - Let's get back. I'll give you the papers you need. You can leave right away. If she comes back here, she hangs. She knows that, so be careful. I will. I'll see you in a week, you hear? Remember those tombstones! - Howdy. - Hi. Name's Randall. Sam Gladstone sent me to pick up Jackie Harris. Pete Link. Can I see your papers? Sure. Three murders. I can't believe it. I just can't believe it. How's that? You'll see. Come on. There's your prisoner. This is the fella they sent to take you back. How do you do? Pleased to meet you, ma'am. I'm Josh Randall. When do we leave, Mr. Randall? First thing in the morning. Good. The sooner the better. Come in the office to sign the papers. I said come in the office to sign the papers. Oh, sure. See you in the morning, Mr. Randall. In the morning... - Hard to believe. - What's the matter? - Sure that's Jackie Harris? - Yeah. It don't make sense, that girl killing three men. I know what you mean. Then again, Sam Gladstone swears she's guilty. - Never known him to be wrong. - Neither have I. - Bye now. - Bye. Bye, Miss. Don't be so sad. It's not for ever. Isn't it? The charges against me are false. It'll be proved so in court. I hope you're right. - Shall we go? - Alright. - Thanks for everything, Pete. - My pleasure. - Bye. - Bye. - Something the matter, Mr. Randall? - I told you I want you ahead of me. Sorry, I forgot. Get up, there! - This better? - Yes, it is. - You're a very good cook. - Thank you. You know the charges against you? Yes. The murders of my husband Will, his brother Art and that foreman. I've heard the Sheriff's story. You must have something to say. - I'm not guilty. - You need to say more than that. I intend to. I'll tell them how the foreman grabbed me. How I was fighting with him when Will came. Will shot him. But before the foreman died, he killed Will and his brother Art. That wasn't story the foreman told. Before dying he told the Sheriff you did all the killing. His way of getting back at me I guess. If you were innocent, why run? I was frightened. I'll do that. You're alone quite a bit, aren't you? You don't talk much. People alone a lot get that way. - You married, Mr. Randall? - No. Why not? It didn't fit my life. At least, not now. - You're a bounty hunter, aren't you? - Yes. Surprised. Why's that? Most of the things I hear about bounty hunters are very unpleasant. But you seem nice. I'll go check the horses. Miss Harris? Miss Harris! - You were supposed to stay here. - We needed more wood for the fire. From now on, if we need anything, I'll get it. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to anger you. Let me have your hands. - That too tight? - No. Now you sleep here. I'm gonna bed down over there. You're a cautious man, Mr. Randall. Old age runs in my family. I'd hate to spoil the record. I don't think that was necessary. - Well, goodnight. - Goodnight. Sure it's not too tight? No, it's fine. Goodnight. Goodnight. Good morning! Morning. If you untie me I'll fix some breakfast. - Why didn't you say something? - Say what? - That the rope was too tight. - Guess I didn't realize. - I want you to know I'm sorry. - You were just doing your job. Is it alright if I go ahead with breakfast? Sure. If you get tired, we'll stop for a while. No. I can go a bit further. Took me mile to catch up with her. Here. What is it? Something wrong? I owe you an apology. What for? Why did you come back and not keep on going? Because I'm innocent. - Thirsty? - Yes. Thank you. Where did your family go from Alabama? Dallas, Texas. My father was the most traveling man you ever saw. We never spent more than 5 months in one spot. It was the opposite with us. We stayed put forever. Not a very nice place, either. I spent most of my time dreaming of being old enough to go anywhere. Then where did you go? Lots of places. East for a while. New York, Boston, back to Georgia. Finally, out here. - You know what I learned? - What? No matter how different places look, they're all pretty much alike. Guess you had your fill of traveling. Yes. How about you? I get tired from time to time. Especially at night on the trail and I pass a house that's all lit up. You get a funny feeling and wonder if you're not missing something. That's right. Yes, I know. I guess that's why I married Will. I wasn't in love with him. I told him I was marrying him mainly to settle down. He said it was alright. Not much of a basis for marriage. Can we talk about something else? I'd like to stay here all day, but we got a lotta ground to cover. I guess so. My father said, "I don't mind you havin' a cow in the kitchen, son, "but shouldn't you introduce him around?" It all sounds like fun. We had hard times, but by and large it wasn't so bad. That's what it'll be like in my family: lots of laughter in the house and good times. I'm a little optimistic, aren't I? Have they ever hanged a woman in this state? Sun's beginning to set. We better stop for the night soon. We're gonna be there in the morning. Yes, I know. We could've made it tonight, couldn't we? Yes. Why didn't we? I guess, because I didn't want to. Neither did I, Josh. - What's the matter? - Everything! You know what'll happen to you in Apam? I'll go on trial and my charges will be proven false. You've got about as much chance of an acquittal as a man on the moon. - Josh, I'm innocent. - How you gonna prove it? No witnesses, the dying word of the foreman and your husband lived there all his life. He was liked. You were a newcomer there. Are you trying to tell me I have no chance? That's what I'm tellin' ya. Don't go to pieces, we'll find a way. - There is no way. - Yes, there is. No. You just said I don't have a chance. Providing I take you in. - You'd let me go? - I don't know. - I just thought of something. - What? There's a town called Black Wells 2 miles before Apam. The eastbound train stops there. If you let me go, I could get that train and we could meet up in 2 weeks. Slow down. Things are happenin' too fast. I've got to have time to think this out. I'll tell you in the morning. Yes, I prefer it that way. I want your decision to be a considered one. Goodnight, Josh. - Hi. - Good morning. Early bird, aren't you? You're a late one. Breakfast is ready. Have you made up your mind? Yes. Well... what did you decide? I'm taking you to Apam. Sorry. It's the only thing I can do. I don't intend to hang. If you're innocent, you can prove it. You're a fool. As big a fool as Will, his brother and that foreman. And you know something? You're gonna die just like they did. I don't understand. You could've escaped when I fell off my horse. Why wait till now? I needed you. It's bad country, full of Indians. I needed you to get me through it. But I don't need you anymore. Goodbye, Mr. Randall. You took the wrong gun. I'll saddle the horses. I wanna make Apam by noon. Miss Harris. You know somethin'? When I look at her, I still can't believe she killed 3 men. Sam, whenever you feel that way, remember what you told me. What's that? Those tombstones... I almost had one of my own. I'll see you now, hear? Subtitles by Teletota OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
