 You looking for somebody, mister? - You got a right to know? - I'm taking that right. - Who are you looking for? - Why? It might be Sheriff Bedloe, and if it is, you're out of luck. - Is that so? Everybody in town is looking for him. It ain't to give him no medal. If I was you, I'd get out of Sand Rock fast. This ain't no place for a stranger. You're not me! THE FAVOR

 - Who is it? - Josh Randall. Beginning to think you didn't get my message. When I hear Hank Bedloe is hiding, I want to find out why. - I need a favor. I need it bad. - I owe you a couple. I want you to get me his partner. - Who is he? - He's Gabe Justin. - The partner? - A man called Ted Jenks. - Well, what's the story? - Sit down. They hit the bank. There was shooting. - Anybody hit? - The bank clerk. His funeral was yesterday. There's been a lot of talking since. You saw the face on the town. It takes one voice and they'll make a mob. That's why you're holed up here.

 Had to move him 3 times since the funeral. I can't leave him alone. Why leave him alone at all? To get his partner. There's no one I can trust. You know where he is? That's why I sent for you. Gabe said he headed for an outlaw town called Bent Horn. You know the place? I've heard of it and I don't want any part of it. Can't you send a deputy? I'd sooner send a 10-year-old kid than send Mike. Anybody opens a bottle, he forgets his own name. You haven't heard all of it. One man's gone after Jenks. - Who? - George Evans, the clerk's brother. If he finds him first, Jenks is dead. Then why worry? He'll end up the same. Jenks is entitled to a trial. - Look, I... - Josh, please... Please, a favor. Please! What's he look like? I don't know. I didn't see the robbery. When I got back, I found Gabe all trussed up and the rest trying to sop up the courage to hang him. - How'd you find out about Jenks? - He told me. - Why do you want him caught? - 'Cause he's a bum. It was his idea, then he skipped town leaving me in trouble. I want him next to me when they drop that door. That's all I want. What's he look like? Light hair. About your size and build. How do you know he's in Bent Horn? That's where we was headed. - See you in a week. - I appreciate it, you know that. Don't know how I'll pay you back. Right now there's a bigger question. - What's that? - Will I be here to collect it? Morning. What'll it be? - What's that? - Rye. I'll take some. Water? If it's bad, water won't help. And if it's good, it won't need any. Well? - Where are you from? - South. - Full house! - Why you... I said cut it out! Well, he's yours. Drag him out! - Why not call the Sheriff? - No point. He'd have told them the rule. They already know that. Rule? It's about the only real law we've got in Bent Horn. You can fight as much as you want, but don't break anything. Oh, say, thanks for the hand. No trouble. - What are you doing here? - Looking for a friend. - What's his name? - Ted Jenks. Know him? - What do you want with him? - Business. We made a deal. Look, mister, we got another rule in Bent Horn. Nobody asks any questions. If you want to see somebody, take a seat. If he's in town, he'll walk by. Look, you did me a favor. I'm trying to do you one. Fred, give me another bottle. All right, mister. What are you really after? - I told you. - You're a liar. Now head for that door and make it first time. - You pulled in that welcome mat! - Lucky you weren't on it. Now you get out of town fast. Jenks is no friend of yours. There's a lot of men in town who'd blow your head off if you gave him any trouble. Now move! You're a little late. What do you mean? I've found what I came for. See you! You're crazy, Evans! Put that thing down! I'm a big man in this town. You'll never get out of here alive. I'll take that chance. George, you got this all wrong! Sure I have! I'll make you a rich man. Anything you want, you just name it. You got it wrong! I didn't have anything to do with killing your brother, believe me. That's enough! What do you want? Put the gun down. This is a private party. I'll ask you once more, then blow you out of your shirt. I don't know who you are but I sure owe you a favor. He was gonna kill me. Said I shot his brother in Sand Rock. I'm gonna remember you. I'm sure of that. All right, let's go. - What? - Outside! Who are you? Josh Randall. I'm doing a favor for the Sheriff. - Bedloe? - That's right. He wants him to stand trial for murder. It's a waste of time and money. That's the way Bedloe wants it. You stay out of the way! The horses are out back. You'll never take him back. It's a 3-day ride. I'll be behind you every minute. Now you listen. I don't care about him, but come too close to this and it'll chew you up. - Come on! - What are you gonna do? That shouldn't be locked. Let's get in there. - Sure, we'll break it down. - Come on, hit it! Once more... - What was the shooting? - Never mind. Where's Jenks? - Gone. - The man with the long gun? - He's taking him to Sand Rock. - That's what he thinks. Drink something, you'll feel better. Nothing but a new head will fix this. You had quite a night. Try the coffee. This stuff isn't gonna do any good. I had nothing to do with that bank robbery. I just came from Sand Rock. Bedloe says you're guilty. Your partner says so. I can't afford an opinion. I'm taking you back. What kind of trial will I get? Bedloe is behind a locked door to make sure Justin gets a fair trial. You'll get the same. Well there's a big difference. Justin did the robbery. Why tie you into something you're not guilty of? To get even. Gabe hates me, he always has. You rode together. That doesn't mean we ate out of the same plate. He wanted me to go along with him. Laid it out nice and pretty, only I turned it down. Reforming? No. Look, I'm not trying to sell you me with wings. It's just that I didn't have any part of that bank job! Best way to prove it is to stand trial. If you're innocent, the jury'll open the doors. They may not have to, you're not about to get me back to Sand Rock. You just keep thinking that. I got reasons. I told you I'm a pretty big man back in Bent Horn. Got friends who wouldn't want to see me hang. Won't do any good out here. You just take a look, Mr. Randall. Pack up, we're moving out. I like it here. Well, unless you get on that horse they're gonna bury you here. Come on, let's take a rest. We lost him. All right. Ten minutes. You better save some of that. Why? We'll be in Sand Rock tomorrow. After that I won't get chance to drink anything. - How'd you get into this business? - What's that? Bounty hunting. How'd you get into it? It just happened. I was working in a bank back home. One day I looked out and it hit me: I was living in a jail. I quit that afternoon. Is it good living? It could be. I don't wanna work that hard. Long as I got a handful of beans, that's all I need. All right, get on your horse. Oh no, I'm not running any more. - You're sure who that is? - It may be a friend of mine. I'll take that chance. Oh no, get on your horse! If you shoot, he'll hear the noise. You're the only one that's got something to lose. Now move! Hold on! We'll go up here. He's leaving. - We'll camp there. - Why do you want to wait there? We'll be better off there than on the trail. I want to go on. If it's Evans, he's in front of us. Still wanna chance it? What if it's one of my friends? Then one of us will use a shovel. And I don't think it'll be you. - Well, tomorrow, huh, Josh? - What? Tomorrow's the day I get it. The courts will decide. You want some more coffee? Much obliged. Jenks? Come on down! I know you're up there! Jenks! You can't get out of here without a horse and water. If you're innocent, the jury'll set you free. All right, Jenks! I'm coming up! A lousy simple job like that and you can't do it right! You... Josh! - The boy's outside. - Jenks? Yeah, you see! I told you it'd be all right! Why did you try to outrun me? What are you on about? I sent Mike with a message for you. I just missed you in town. I tried to catch up to you, but... Who'd you think I was? That was you out there? You disappeared from the trail. I tried to find you. After you left, we found out Gabe Justin had been lying about Jenks. Didn't have thing to do with the robbery. No, not a thing. Can you imagine Gabe lying like that! Old Jenks innocent... Another fellow altogether. I bet old Jenks'd like to hear it. Yeah, where is he? I want to tell him. Outside. Where are you going? To find a church. Coming? Subtitles by Télétota
