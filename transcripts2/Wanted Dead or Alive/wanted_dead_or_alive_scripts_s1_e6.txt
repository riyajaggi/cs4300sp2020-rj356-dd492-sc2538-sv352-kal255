 Rydel said you'd tackle anything. Provided it appeals to me. I don't work blind, Mr. Walker. This job is simple. I want you to accompany me on a ride to Banner, Texas. There's a man there who's wanted here. - Help me bring him back. - His name? Whiteside, Clay Whiteside. But Lord knows what name he's using now. - What did he do? Robbed this bank 5 years ago. He was captured and the money recovered but he escaped on the way to prison. For 5 years, I haven't heard a word about him. But then, last week this letter came for his brother. It's from Whiteside, postmarked Banner. I guess he thought we'd all forgotten him. But I never forgot. Not one minute. With this information, why come to me and not the law? They've been after him for 5 years and haven't found him. I have. And I want him. For robbing this bank? That's all you need to know. I'm afraid I'll have to turn you down. Like I said, I don't work blind. Goodbye, sir. Wait. He killed my son. My only son. He forced him into a gunfight and killed him. I demanded his arrest but he was never convicted. 3 months later he robbed this bank. Now he's gonna pay. He's gonna pay for everything. - Will you ride to Banner with me? - Yes. We leave at sunup tomorrow. - I'll meet you out front. - I'll be there. Suppose he can't be taken alive. So much the better. - Who is it? - Mrs. Walker. I must see you. Are you the one my husband hired? The one who was going with him to get Clay Whiteside? Yes, ma'am. I've tried to talk him out of it but he won't listen. Once he gets an idea in mind you can't budge him. How long a trip is it to Banner, Texas? About 2 weeks. - Through bad country? - Yes, it is. He'll never make it. Mr. Randall, my husband's not a well man. The doctors keep warning him but he insists on acting like a 20-year-old. Want me to cancel the trip? Tell him I can't go? That wouldn't stop him, he'd go on alone. What do you want me to do? I want you to take care of him, protect him as much as you can. I want you to bring him back to me alive. I'll do my best. Thank you. Mrs. Walker. I'd kinda like to come back alive myself. Why do you say that? I get the feeling I'm not being told everything. Now what about it? There is something you should know. Concerning the man you're going after, Clay Whiteside. He was guilty of the bank robbery. Your husband told me that. And he killed our son. He told me that too. I'm going to tell you something I'm sure my husband hasn't. Clay Whiteside was not to blame for that killing. A dozen people saw that fight and every one of them testified under oath that our son provoked it. Self-defense? Yes. The jury set him free. To be honest, Mr. Randall, my son was really not a very nice boy. He was always looking for trouble. You see, it wasn't Whiteside's fault. The blame was ours. My husband's and I. Why do you say that? We spoiled him. My husband wouldn't admit that in a million years. Goodnight, Mr. Randall. Thank you, Mrs. Walker. Thank me? Why? I know how hard it was to tell me that. Goodnight. How far you think it is to Mackinaw? About 40 miles. That's not bad for 4 days. At that rate we'll be in Banner by Thursday. If we're still alive by then. What's that supposed to mean? You're pushing the horses. I'm in a hurry. I wanna get there too. But those horse ain't gonna last with you pushing them. We'll get fresh ones, the next town we come to. It's not only the horses. What, you can't take it? I was thinking about you. Don't mind about me. I can ride like this forever. You're the most stubborn man I've known. What did you say? You're the most stubborn man, I've known, sir. I'm also the boss here and the pace won't let up. If anything, it'll get faster. Now let's move on out. Mr. Walker! Whoa! We could ride another 2 hours before sundown. My horse can't go another mile and neither can yours. Sure it's the horses you're concerned about? What do you mean by that? Young fellas today are too soft. Know why? Because you baby yourselves. You want everything easy. At your age, I could stay in the saddle a week. Day and night. Eat and sleep in the saddle. At the end of the week I was stronger than when I started. Congratulations. But might I point out one thing? What's that? You're not my age any more. You're as young as you feel, and I feel like riding some more. You'll have to make it alone then. You're quitting? I'll catch up with you tomorrow. Catch up with me? Stop now and you won't see me till you get to Banner. - Maybe. I got $10 says you won't. That's a bet. See you in Banner. How ya doin'? I owe you $10. What's the verdict? Am I gonna live? - That depends. - On what? You. You're a sick man, Mr. Walker. With your heart, you've no business riding a horse. Forget the lectures. I've had enough of those. Too bad you didn't listen to them. What am I gonna do now? For the next 2 weeks, you're not gonna move a muscle. You're gonna lie right here in this bed. Impossible. I've got urgent business. Your most urgent business now is trying to stay alive. Am I that bad off? You're that bad off. I'll come back and see you this afternoon. How far are we from Banner? About a week's ride. Don't think about trying to make it. No. I'm staying here. But you're gonna go to Banner. But I need you to identify Whiteside? I told you what he looks like. That description fits 7 men out of 10. Perhaps he's still using the same name. I doubt that. I think the best thing to do is let it all go for a while. I don't care what you think. I'm interested in just one thing: getting Whiteside. Then give me more to go on or I stop right here. There is one other thing: the way he draws. If you saw him, you'd spot it right away. Why's that? Because of the funny knack he has of grabbing his right wrist with his left hand when he fires. He draws with his right hand like this, then grabs his wrist with his left before he pulls the trigger. Never saw a man do that before. Well you see, it's a habit he got into when he was a kid. When his uncle took him shooting, the gun was too heavy for the boy to hold in one hand, and the habit stuck. I can't make every man in Banner draw his gun. No, but you could ask around. Maybe somebody has seen him do it. I mean, that's a possibility. Like a needle in a haystack. Look, I'll pay you for your time whether you find him or not. Well, that appeals to me. I'll give it a try. But one thing... What's that? This business about Whiteside's draw or whatever his name is... He won't draw without a reason. - So? How do you force a man to draw and put away the gun quiet? Mornin'. Mornin'. Quarters and feed for my horse. A buck a day. That'll be all right. - How long you gonna be? - Don't know yet. In town for something special? Looking for a man named Whiteside. Know him? Not in this town. Not that name. What's he look like? - I've never seen him. - Then you got trouble findin' him. Ever see a man draw like this? Sorry. Thanks anyway. Rye. Josh Randall. - Hello, Phil. - Surprised to see me? Yeah, a little. I've been out 5 months. Shortened sentence for good behavior. - Glad to hear it. - I bet you are. What's on your mind? You. You've been on my mind for quite a while now. 3 years to be exact. I'm not looking for trouble Phil. You don't have to. It's already found you. That's enough now! What's going on here? - It's a private matter. - Then settle it privately. Come on. The name's Randall. Josh Randall. Earl Tipton. Much obliged. Better tell me what the fight was about. He was cattle rustling in Oklahoma. He was wanted: I caught him. Got sent away for 3 years. Swore he'd get even with me. - We just ran into each other today. - You a lawman? No. Bounty hunter. - What you doin' in Banner? - Business. A man named Clay Whiteside. He's wanted in Lauring for a bank robbery 5 years ago. Think he's here? Could be. Name sound familiar? No. Can't say it does. What's he look like? About 6 feet tall, 140 pounds, sandy hair. About 40. Must be 50 men here with those measurements. - I don't wonder. - That all you got on him? Not quite. Ever see a man hold a gun like this? No. Up a back alley! Mind if I nose around a bit? Help yourself. I'll see you later. - His name's Whiteside. - Whiteside? Well, I had a fella named Burnside. He wasn't more than 5 foot. Beat me out of a week's rent. Much obliged, ma'am. Ever see a man draw like this? That's a new one on me. Thanks. Well? Well what? Ever see or hear of a man who draws like that? How come you're asking all these questions? - Does it bother you? - I don't like snoopy people. It's all right, Bert. Go ahead and tell him. The answer's no. I never saw anyone draw like that. A real friendly town. They're nice folks, easy to get along with. Got my horse ready? Yes, sir! All ready and saddled for you. Sure I can't talk you into stayin'? Plenty of room at my place and you're welcome. I'd like to, but there's not much more I can do here. I better ride on back. - How are you, Earl? - Fine, Jack. You? Oh, no complaints! I wish I coulda been more help to you. If he should pass by again, you might wire Mr. Walker in Lauring. - I'll do that. - Hope I see you again! That's as far as you go! Didn't I tell ya he'd be sensible? Get down off that horse. 3 years I've waited for this. Know how long 3 years in a prison is, Josh? Like forever. That's how it seems sometimes. Just like forever. So take a good long look around. It's all over bar... Unbuckle those belts and let 'em drop. - You didn't have to do that. - That's the way I shoot best. You didn't have to shoot. You coulda stayed in Banner, let them kill me. I intended to. What changed your mind? Not quite sure. Well I'm glad you did. What happens now? The law says you could take me in. The law says you have no business here. It's not your county. So how does that leave us? With your record of the past 5 years, they'd suspend your sentence if you turned yourself in. Could be. Sound advice. I'm gonna ride in that direction. You go back the way you came. That'll make us about even. You're the strangest bounty hunter I ever run across. That may be. Whiteside... goodbye. Tipton. Goodbye and good luck. - Don't make me regret it. - No chance of that. What will you tell old man Walker? Oh, I don't know. I'll think of something. I'll see you now. Come in. So you finally got back, eh? Just got in. What happened? I couldn't find him. Any leads? A guy fitting his description was in Banner when the letter was mailed. Where is he? Stayed in town a few days then left. No one knows or where he went. I knew it was bad news, the minute I looked at your face. I did the best I could. Sorry, Mr. Walker. What's our next step? There shouldn't be a next step. What do you mean? I mean this hunt oughta stop. Why? Two reasons: it's hopeless and you're in no shape to travel. Who says so? The doctor. I saw him on the way in. We'll start on Thursday. It's not fair. What's not fair? My boy gets killed. Nobody pays for it. Someone oughta pay for the death of my son. Someone is paying for it. Who's that? You.
