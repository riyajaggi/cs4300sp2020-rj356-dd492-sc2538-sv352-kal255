 You shaved your whiskers, but it's you all right. There's a $200 reward for you out of Pot Hole. I aim to collect it. Move that gun and I'll kill you! Hand over the weapon. Butt first. Much obliged. Let's go. MIRACLE AT POT HOLE - That must be Pot Hole. - You mean you never been there? No. Picked up the wanted poster from the sheriff in Tucson. What kind of a man are you to sell me out for a miserable $200?

 Save the sermon, Crane. Not interested. Maybe you're interested in this? $300 if you let me go. 400! Still not interested. May be hard for you to understand, but when it comes to justice, I pay with the law. - Justice! Money-grabbing gunslinger! What do you know about justice? I do some good here and there. Take care of thieves and bullies who raise terror with innocent folks. - Like Petingil who you shot. - I didn't shoot him! That's up to the people of Pot Hole to decide. The people in Pot Hole? Mister, you got a lot to learn. Maybe. Let's go. - Stop there! - Easy now! One more step and we'll blow you to kingdom come and back again. Just bringing in a prisoner. Who's your prisoner? Here he is. Well, it's Penfold Crane. Hey, Jake! Yeah... Shaved off his beard. But that's him all right. Hey, Jake! We got Crane! Charlie, roll out a barrel of whisky. Don't stand around! Go scare up a jury. Spread the word. I want me a mob in here. We want this to be a public trial. And send over for Bessie. Quick! Now, son, what you say your name was? Josh Randall. You just met up with Chute Wilson. I take it you're the sheriff here? Sheriff, prosecuting attorney, judge... you name it. Anything you want in Pot Hole, see Chute Wilson. I assume you're a drinking man? Step up to the bar. - Oh, the cash box! - I'll get it. Keep your blasted paws off of that! You got a prisoner to guard. If he gets away, we'll hang you. Now then... - What's your pleasure? - $200. Oh, the bounty. I thank you. Now you can pay for your own drink. - You're both judge and prosecutor? - That's right. That's a whole lot of power just for one man. The voters don't seem to think so. They've elected me four times running. By acclaim. - What do you think you're doing? - Waitin'. I'd kinda like to see this trial. Hey, Charlie! Take out another barrel. Take your time, gents. I'll take care of all of you! I just want you to put down $500 to try and get some of this land. - This is the best money can buy. - Here you are. Look at that money roll in. He said, "Honey, my hotel don't take no cats, dogs, lizards or snakes!" Curly Petingil was one of us. If we don't handle this, who will? - When is the trial gonna start? - When I'm good and ready. When's that gonna be? I said when I'm good and ready. Hey, Chute! The padre! - Coming here? - Yeah. Who's next, gents? I heard there was a trial in here. What about it? Just havin' one, Padre. For the heat. For the heat, huh? - What are you doing here, Sam? - My duty, Padre. I'm a juror. Think you'll be sober enough to hold a man's life in your hands? - I never fell asleep in court yet. - Oh, no! Neither have I. So don't start preaching at me. You like to watch a man die, don't you? - Why not? - Sure, why not... It's good to see man on the gallows, helpless and scared, glad it's not you. Almost as good as shooting a man in the back! Isn't it, Wilson? You're a little out of bounds. This is no church. This is no court of law either! How long is it gonna take you people to find out what kind of man this is? Can't you see he's not interested in justice? Just a minute! You got no right to say that. All he wants is to drag you in here to buy his whisky and guns. He doesn't give you law. He only pretends to. He gives you a good time all right, so you come back again and again. Well let me warn you. All of you! Anyone who has a hand in this drunken carnival will be debasing something sacred given to him by Almighty God: the purity and sanctity of his own soul! Get out of here, all of you! Go on, git! Now just a minute! Lester, take down the name of every man that leaves. Take 'em down, I said! I wanna know who my friends are around here. Don't let him bluff you. Go on home, all of you! As for those who stay: step up to the bar. The drinks are on the house! Looks like you don't understand these men as well as I do. Men? I don't see any men here. Hustle it up, I wanna get this trial started. Now I see how you did it. Did what? Got yourself elected. You know, Crane ain't the only man wanted in Pot Hole. We're also lookin' for a fella who shot the blacksmith last year. What about it? The more you hang around... the more you look like that fella. The prisoner will rise. Mr. Crane, you're accused of murdering Curly Petingil with premeditation on or about 3 September just past at his mine 4 miles in the hills to the north-east of this community. - How do you plead? - Not guilty. We'll see. Now, as the prosecuting attorney for this county, I'll present the opening argument. Gentlemen of the jury, this case is as simple as 1-2-3. One: this defendant breezed into town early last September and bought into partnership with Petingil. Two: Curly took him up into the hills to show him his mine. Three: Curly was found dead, shot in the back. The few sacks of gold he'd spent the blistering summer digging for was gone. That doesn't prove I killed him. Sure I went there with him, but I left him there alive. - Is that so? - I swear! Somebody else... - Yeah? I'd like to know who. How do I know, I was on my way to Tucson. He was on his way to Tucson. Did you hear that? - You stole his gold. - I didn't. Then prove it! This is a court of law. Bring in your witnesses and prove it. Hold on a minute! What do you want? You got the shoe on the wrong foot, mister. "Judge." You're out of order, son. This is a trial, in case you didn't know it. Then let's make it a legal trial, according to the book. Listen, you! No, you listen. You got this all backwards. Any tenderfoot legal clerk knows a man is innocent till proven guilty. He's right! You're the one who must furnish proof. Or doesn't the law mean anything here? All right, I'll give you proof. Call Bessie Thorn to the stand. Bessie Thorn! Keep this up and you'll get more proof than you bargained for. Raise your right hand, Bessie. Do you swear to tell the truth and nothing but the truth? I sure do. Sit down, Bessie. State your name and where you live. Bessie Thorn, Blue Eagle Pass, Meredith County. What's she got to do with this? She doesn't know Petingil! No, but she knows you. 'Cause you did the same to her husband Joe. Ain't that right? Sure as hellfire and brimstone. He invested in Joe's mine, went up to see him, shot him and took his gold. 2 sacks! She's crazy. I didn't even know Thorn was dead. There you have it, gents. It's as clear as day. This man makes a career out of bushwhacking miners. You got anything to say on the subject? No. But I got plenty to say. Sure, I've been backing miners for 6 years from Colorado to Mexico. I admit I backed Petingil and Thorn. But it doesn't prove I killed them. These hills are crawling with outlaws from all over the country. Miners are being shot every day. Is that all the defense you got? That's all I need. Killing Thorn, which I didn't, doesn't prove I killed Curly. The jury will decide on the merits of the evidence. I know that much about the law. Sit down. Take a good look at him. And take a good look at this poor widow. Left to face a harsh life alone. And don't forget our friend Curly. An honest, decent neighbor, left in the desert for the birds of prey. The jury will retire and arrive at a decision. In the meantime, I fine you $200. What? For contempt of court. Court is in recess! Open the bar! - You're crazy... - I fined you $200. Get it up. Nothin' doin'. Collect the fine. Any more trouble around here, there'll be another trial tomorrow. - You know what the jury's gonna do. - I'm afraid I do, my son. In my horse's saddlebags you'll find 3 pouches of gold. Take 'em and put 'em to good use. - It's very generous, but... - Go on. Before Chute gets 'em. The bounty hunter will show you which horse. Now come on. Go and test that trap. Make sure it's working real good. Hey, Chute, that's my drink! OK, here. - Would you count it, please? - What for? In Pot Hole, when you take charge of someone's personal effects, it's best to have a witness. All right. What is it? I'm not sure, Padre. They're well-made gallows. Chute has the best all right. His hangings are very important to him. They amuse his friends and scare his enemies. What if we couldn't switch it around, Padre? Scare his friends, at least. Have you reached a verdict? Your Honor, we the members of the jury find the defendant guilty as charged. The prisoner will rise. Mr. Crane, it's my duty as judge to sentence you to hang until dead. Right now. Would you like to have me pray with you? Excuse me, ma'am. Is that your rig? Yes. Why? May I ask whose brand is on the horse? - My husband's. - Much obliged. Get on with it! Please! Please! I feel I must warn you once more. What's happening here today is unjust. That's all, Padre. You better wait down there. I'll wait right here. - What did you do? - Me? Nothing. Charlie! Take his gun, Padre. No wonder it's stuck. The latch has been jammed with sand. This has been burned clean through! - I thought you tested it. - I did. It was working. - What is this? - Hold it! Just a moment! Before there's any shooting, have you asked yourselves why the gallows trap stuck? Whaddaya think? Somebody jammed the latch. Maybe so. But it could be something bigger. It could be God's way of giving you men another chance! Think about it! Does anyone really believe this man has had a fair trial? Of course he did. I said ask yourself this question and consider it carefully. Each of your souls is marked! Are you willing to answer to Almighty God for taking a human life, just because you wanna be in good with Chute Wilson? Don't listen to him! Who's running this town? I think you made a mistake this time. I don't understand. What really happened with the gallows? The Lord moves in strange ways, his wonders to perform. All right, get on. Hey, aren't you gonna untie me? - I'm takin' you to Meredith County. - What for? For the murder of her husband. You've seen this before. Joe Thorn's brand. There's an exact copy on her horse's hindquarters. I'm not sayin' you're guilty. That's up to the court. If you knew all this, why didn't you let them hang him? I don't believe in Chute Wilson's law. - May I ride along with you? - Yes, ma'am. Glad to make your acquaintance, Padre. I'll see you now.
