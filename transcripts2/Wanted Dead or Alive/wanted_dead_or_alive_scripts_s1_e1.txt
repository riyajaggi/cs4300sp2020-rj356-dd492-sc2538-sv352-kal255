 Wanted: Dead or Alive (1958–1961): Season 1, Episode 1 - The Martin Poster - full transcript 
 When the bounty hunter Josh Randall visits the marshal's office in La Tunas, he steps straight into a tense situation, where the robber Andy Martin is trying to uncage his brother Carl from jail. Josh intervenes, but is knocked down. Carl kills the marshal, and the two brothers escape through the back door. In fleeing Carl is shot in his shoulder by Josh. When the townspeople find Josh and the dead marshal, they accuse Josh for the murder, as they are convinced that it was he who was trying to uncage Carl Martin to be able to get the award for him. Josh pulls his gun and flees through the back door. It is his intention to capture the brothers - dead or alive - and bring them back to La Tunsa, to get the award for Andy Martin, but also to prove his own innocence.

 Bounty hunter. What are you doing in Las Tunis? - Carl Martin. I want his brother. - Why? - I got a poster... - I'll get it! You must take us for a bunch of rubes! Carl had over 1500 on his head. It was him you came here for. That's not true! You came to get Carl out of jail and one of you killed the Marshall. It don't concern me which one, the only difference is, you're here. - What about Andy? - You lied about him. The rest too. We're right, aren't we? Aren't we? Make a move and I'll slice you open!

 Listen, I wasn't on his side. You didn't move far to prove it. Don't kill me! Okay, big man. Get over in that chair and sit down. You, bring my horse round back. People will ask questions. Better have the right answers then! Do it, Tom, please, do it. If you want your friend to keep breathing, don't step out of line. Looks like you might live for supper. Your friend's doing good. You broke my hand. You're lucky you can still feel it! Now stay there. Who is it? Tom Wade. I'll open up and if you're not alone you'll be first to drop. You're a smart man. I want to be around to be able to get smarter. Take care of your friend, he has hand trouble. - You coming back? - When I find Andy Martin. He won't be enough. Next time we'll be ready for you. Good and ready. - Yes? - You the doc? - I try. - Get your bag. I got a patient for you. Where is he? Up the road, too sick to move. We don't have much time. - Take me a minute to get my horse. - Don't worry, there's one outside. Maybe you'd better bring him here. He's dying. Hurry up or he'll finish the job! I'll be right with you. What's this? Step it up, doc. Time you gave me an explanation. If this is a joke it isn't funny. Off the horse. Hold it, you forgot your bag, doc. Hold it. Carl. Carl, you okay? Doc, come here! - What happened? - He was bit by a fly. - When? - This morning. In a pig yard? Fix him up and save the funny words. - Can't you give him anything? - Hit him with a bat! You missed your calling. - Should've been a minstrel. - I wish I was. Andy! I'm right here. You're in my light. Who's in the grave? Nobody. So what's it for? If we have any visitors, we want them to think Carl died. You'll make sure he doesn't. I'm here, Carl. Fly must've had 30 teeth. Will he be alright? With rest and a lot of luck... he'll be back chasing flies. Hurry up. He isn't going anywhere for maybe a week. Patch him up, we're leaving. - I shouldn't have taken the trouble. - What do you mean? Take him he'll be dead in 2 miles. We'll risk it. - We can't stay here. - What is it? Badge fever? What? Figures. I heard what happened up in Las Tunis. This fella should be Carl Martin. And you, his brother Andy. Those fellas up north are chasing the wrong man. Stick to the jokes, doc. Carl... Carl, wake up. - Snap out of it. - I'm tired. Sure you are but we gotta get out of here. - I'm tired! - Sure you are. I gotta find Louise. - Louise. - Who's that? A friend. Nice that you've got one. I can't do any more here. You're right, doc. You are so right. He's still alive. Hold it! Your shot went wide. This one won't. Your hands... move it slow. Get out in front of you. I'd like to kill you standing up but I'll let you vote on it! Get up. You're a brave man! Easy, once you get the knack. Move! The other way. I don't want to shoot you here, the kid needs his sleep. Take it easy! - Something wrong? - Don't wake him up. Would you be quiet! - What? - Be quiet! Louise! Louise! - You'll be alright. - Andy. Andy, I wanna go home. Please, I wanna go home now. Alright, we'll go home. Who are you? - What do you want? - Just passing through. Get in. Thought maybe you'd lend me a chair. - Why do you want a chair? - To slide it under a table. Been so long since I had a sit-down meal, I can't even bend that way! - This is the Martin place? - That's right. How do you know? A few miles back, they told me I'd find it. Didn't they have any chairs? I don't know, I didn't ask. Are your brothers home? Carl is, he's the youngest. The youngest boy. He's not too well. He and Andy, my other brother, went up to Santa Fe and were robbed. - Carl got shot. - Is that right? He was in terrible shape when they brought him home. - We didn't think he'd make it. - He's okay now? He's still in bed but he's a little better. What about Andy? I'm not sure. After he brought Carl home he said he had business. Didn't say where, or when he'd be back. Still want that chair? Sure do. Come on up to the house. Go on in, don't be bashful. Shut the door. What's going on? All he wants is something to eat. Saw you coming up, Randall. I made no secret of it. You know him? He shot me! Seems I didn't do a good job. See? He admits it. - Tell her why! - Shut up! Tell her how you and Andy cut a man in half. I told you to shut up. What's he talking about? I was gonna let you live till Andy got back, but not now! What's he mean? Nothing. He's trying to save his own skin. Get over there and sit on that cot. You don't think I'll do it. Will you? You saw what I did to your friend. - Your back's no thicker! - You did kill him! You're gonna pay for this, Randall. And the price is gonna be real high. I just wish I could do it slow. What are you gonna do now? Wait... for the other one. Louise! Sit down and be quiet. Hi, honey. How's Carl? Stand easy. What are you doing? Collecting. Hands on the wall. - Is he okay? - Yes. He don't look too good. If you hurt him, I'll kill you. I'd walk easy if I were you. I can still see Wilcox when he went down. - Taking us back to Las Tunis? - That's it. Please, may I say something? - Go ahead. - You're a bounty hunter, right? We haven't got much but you can take what we have if... Martin. I'm gonna take you. You're good to me dead or alive. Make up your own mind. You can't get out. Don't make things worse. I'm coming in. Four... thirty-five hundred. There, that's a reward on both of them. Thanks. - I think I owe you an apology. - Don't worry. I wanted you to know. - Mr. Wade, would you do me a favor? - If I can. Put this in Mrs. Wilcox's account without her knowing it's from me. - I'll try, I don't quite know how. - But you'll figure a way. - I'll figure a way. - Thanks. Josh. You know, I heard a lot about you. Not much of it's been good. You do a thing like this but you don't want anyone to know. If word got around, you might have more friends. The kind of friends who have to know, I don't want. See you now, hear. Subtitles by Télétota
