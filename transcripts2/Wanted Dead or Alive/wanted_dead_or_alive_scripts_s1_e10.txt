 Longhorn City, folks. How long, driver? Long enough to drop the mail and stretch a bit. My apologies, sir. Yes, sir? Do you have a Miss Tracey Ryan registered here? Yes, she's here. - Is the Missouri Queen a riverboat? - Room number, please? Nothing like a riverboat. You know, last time I was on one... My stage leaves in just a moment. Oh, sorry. Miss Ryan's in number 207.

 I can see that. I'm willing to pay for it. $300. - $600, anything! - You got trouble with the law? I can't go to the marshal. Not now. Later, maybe, but not now. Tell me you'll help, please! I can't make a living at faro. It isn't a very flattering picture. "Stacy Torrance..." Tracey Ryan! I hope that's your twin sister. They want me for the murder of my husband, Leo. Sorry, I'd rather lose at faro. But I don't think he's dead. I think Leo's alive. You think! I'm not sure. I mean, I was sure but I'm not any more. When you decide, you let me know. Josh, wait! Making up a woman's mind is riskier than a shoot-out in the dark. Josh! What happened to her? She's lovesick. I'll take her to a doctor. - Mr. Randall!... - Relax, she's my mother. This isn't my room! It's mine. Easy. You need help, remember? Working for me or the reward? Both. If I don't like your story, I might turn you in. Don't play games with me, Josh. I'm afraid I mean it, Stacy. Well, another bounty man wouldn't give me this chance. Maybe I'm winning a little. You might be at that. Let's hear about it. Leo and I were married about a year ago. He was an actor on the riverboats along the Missouri. Actor, drunkard, gambler, drifter... I picked myself a good one, I did! What was it? Love, sympathy or just plain bad judgment? All of 'em. I had big plans for us. Our marriage would give Leo the strength he needed. Give him a purpose, direction, blah, blah, blah. Pretty thoughts. And he put the spurs to them? We bought a riverboat of our own, the "Missouri Queen". Bought it with my money. Leo taught me all the tricks. How to palm a deck and spike a drink... How to lie, cheat, steal... All the rules for success. And then... When things looked good, he told me to get out. He wanted full ownership of the boat. We had an argument, a fight. And he threatened me with a knife. He said I'd do things his way or he'd carve his initials in my face. - Your face looks alright to me. - He tried, he really did. I fought him off and... and then he slipped. - He slipped... - And he fell on the knife, right? I was scared. I was so scared I didn't know what to do. I dragged the body onto the deck and I let it fall into the river. - That was a fool thing to do. - I know, but I had the panics. I shouldn’t have run away either but I did. I've been running ever since. When was this? Three or four months ago. Oh, Josh! If we can just find Leo and prove that he's still alive, I'll turn myself in for attempted murder. That's wish talk, honey. And wishing isn't gonna make that man undead. Leo was here this morning. - What? - He was right here in this town. He left on that stage a while ago. It was Leo who put that poster under my door. - Wait a minute... - You got to believe me. Why? You tell me why. Because that's Leo's way. That's his kind of revenge. All he has to do is point you out to a marshal. That's too simple, too quick. He's trying to break me, to twist me apart. That's why I got the poster instead. Sure. And he twists the wings off of butterflies. Here, look at this! Is that some kind of lie? I'm sorry, Stacy. I'm just sorry. I'll keep you locked in till I get back. What will you do? I don't know. I've never chased a ghost before. - Mr. Randall... - When did the stage leave here? About 20 minutes ago. That lady... Yes, my mother. She's very old and very tired. Now if anyone at all disturbs her, I'll have your job. Hold it, Wattie. All I want's one of your passengers. - What for? - Personal reasons. Get rid of that gun belt before you do any visiting. Where is he? - Who? - The riverboat captain. Back in Longhorn City. - He didn't ride out here with you? - Nope. - Any idea where he went? - That ain't my business. It's not yours, either. Move along there! Have you seen a riverboat captain? We're a long way from any river. Very funny. Come here. I can't tell a man how to treat a frilly woman like Tracey. - But this concerns a murder. - Is that so? Take a look at this. Where'd you get this? Couple of bounty hunters. - Where from? - I don't know. Listen, they know she works here, that's why they came to me. I'm to get half the reward. I just tell them where to find her. I'd gladly share my half with you. All you got to do is tell me where... - Mr. Randall... - Later! - Alright, where is she? - What? What did you do with her? - Your mother? - Never mind the joke. - What did you do with the girl? - I don't know. You're lying! You're the only one who's got a key to that room! You'd better talk! Tell me! These two men came from Summit Pass. Bounty men. They wanted her. With long, sharp fingernails? Long, sharp and scratchy! The truth! I told you the truth! These two men asked about Miss Ryan. Or Torrance, that was the name on the poster. I kept her safe. - Didn't let them near her. - Show me. I was just keeping her safe till the marshal got back in town. The bounty men could have shot her. Show me where she is, now! She's in that closet. Here, this is the key. Use it! Just keeping her safe! - Miss Ryan... - You make me sick! Hey, wait! Check-out time. Mice. - You got a horse? - No. - Where are we going? - The poster was left in Summit Pass. By someone related by marriage. Looks like a ghost town. Good place to find a dead man who's undead. You're beginning to believe me, aren't you, about Leo? He's been here alright! Take the horse and put him in that barn. Keep out of sight. Might be a good place to rest. You been acting like you need it. He's made a nest up there. He could show up any minute. - And when he does? - That depends. Shoo. Find yourself a shadow to hide in. I have to know what you'll do. I'd appreciate a chance to handle this in my own way. I need the experience. You could kill him, Josh. I suppose so. He's dead. Officially dead. If you gun him down, it won't matter a bit. Pretty ugly words from such a pretty girl. Sounds strange coming from you. Look what he's done to me, Josh! If he's alive, you stand a chance in court. Isn't that what we want? I suppose so. Come on. Let's find you a new home, keep you out of the way. - Wait in here until I call you. - Alright. Josh, I'm sorry. Good afternoon. I hope you don't mind my seeking shelter. I helped myself to drinking water. I intend to pay for it. - That's alright, Torrance. - Torrance? Leo Torrance. Actor, gambler, riverboat captain... and part-time corpse. You must be a friend of Stacy's. - That's right. - That explains the gun. Are you a killer too? How many do you know? Just Stacy. Murdered the only man whoever loved her. You look alive enough. Must we have that gun? You Westerners can't converse without hardware. Hands behind your neck. - Pardon? - Hands behind your neck. Can we be friendly now? Not just yet, Torrance. Leo Torrance is dead, sir. His clothes fit you pretty well. His clothes? Oh, this uniform. I took over the Missouri Queen after Leo was killed. Why aren't you on it? Because she's in dry dock. The weather in the East is miserable. The weather here hasn't been so good either. Those posters... Ah yes, the posters. I sincerely hope they've done some good. Yeah, just fine. Driven Stacy out of her mind. She stabbed poor Leo and dropped him in the river. I don't know what she said but Leo Torrance is dead. I am the instrument of his justice. You tell Stacy that? - Is she here? - You'll see her. Very thorough. I suppose this is to be my truth test. Remember, you said it, not me, Torrance. That away. Well, Leo! He answers to his name! You startled me. I intended to. Surely this isn't your truth test? I'm taking you both to the marshal. Let him figure this out. Stacy's wanted for murder. Your murder, Leo. And you're still alive. - Well, it was fun while it lasted. - Fun! That's enough, Stacy! - Feel better now? - No. That's enough. You won't shoot me. Don't bet on it. You need me alive to keep Stacy from hanging. Alright... Why, Stacy? Why? You can take me in, Josh. Now the poster is right.
