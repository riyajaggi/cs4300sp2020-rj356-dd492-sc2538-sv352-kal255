Cool key chain. [moaning] Hey, you want a raisin? Poop. Good! We need to make a list of extracurriculars for you. They look good on college applications. Well, does sneaking into Justin's room look good on an application? If you're applying to prison. - How'd it go? - Not good. I don't know what we're gonna do with her. Ooh, I know what you could do with her. Buy her a mini-fridge and send her to her room. We could take the old nightstand and put ice in the drawers. And then... She has to go to college and move out. She has to. Um... Alex, honey, I think what your mother is trying to explain is that your graduation day is gonna be a day that we all celebrate for different reasons and in different ways. OK. Good talk. - Jerry! - No. You know what? I was gonna surprise you guys, but since you're all on my back about my extracurr-ackulars, I will just... I will just tell you. I joined Book Club. And I finished Book Club. Are you sure you didn't mean Comic Book Club? Yeah. No, no. They even gave me an award for reading the most books. You understand that I'm proud of you, and you also understand because you're you, I'm gonna need proof. Of course, Daddy. One award, coming up. All right. I need an award, so let's go to Justin's room. Hey, Alex, I'm on your side again. Justin insulted me. He got all mad because I got hamburger meat for his monster's brains. An Alex-proofing monster with a meatloaf brain? Come on! - Let's just get the trophy and get out of here. - Don't worry. We'll take care of the monster first. Where would a monster with meat for brains hide? Over here! [screaming] [continues screaming] - [grunting] - [screaming] Sorry, Alex. I faint when I'm scared, but I'm also scared of fainting, so then I wake up. [growling] I capture Alex in Justin's room! [screaming] Sounds like my monster trap has sprung. Nice, dude. I'm on your side now. - Weren't you always on my side? - Up until that question. - [screaming] - Harper, do not look at the monster. - You'll faint again. - OK. OK. I'm just gonna keep my eyes shut, keep looking for the trophy and let's get out of here. [grunting] - I found the trophy! - Harper, that's not the trophy. That's the meatloaf brain that Max... Wait a minute. If that's in there... what's in there? I don't know what you're looking at. My eyes are closed. I have motherboard 60840 for brain. He put his old laptop in there. So your brain thinks like a computer? [grunting] OK. I'm gonna take that as a yes. Um... Can you just give me one second? OK. Psst. Come here. What's that thing you do to quit something on a computer? Oh! You hit the control, alt and delete keys. Right. Uh, hey, FrankenGirl. Since you kind of have us trapped in here, we're sort of, like, totally under your... - Control? - Yes. Now, here's a little brainteaser for you. What's a delicious ice cream drink without an "M"? [grunts] Alt? I was gonna say, "Ilkshake." And now, I'd like you to say the word "delete." Delete. That wasn't so... - Wait a minute. - [beeping,  machinery winding down] Thank you very much. This will work as a Book Club trophy. Let's get out of here. A-ha! No! Nice Alex-proofing, Justin. But it looks like I finished Book Club. I am on your side now. What can I say? I love a winner. OK, Alex. It's payback time. You want to come in my room and take things? Well, here you go. Bring FrankenGirl  back to alive You're Alex's BFF  and that's no jive Hey, nanny nanny  Ha cha cha [beeping] [growling] Best friend forever. - Take that, Alex. - Nice try, Justin. Say, "Control, alt, delete." Control. Alt. Delete. A-ha. You know the "Hey, nanny nanny, ha cha cha" part? - That was a spell lock. - [FrankenGirl laughs] We need to make friendship totally stronger. Let's share secrets. Mine is that I'm a chocoholic. I love it, but it goes straight to my forehead. - Now, you go. - OK, here's mine. This ain't really working out for me. Slumber party! [FrankenGirl laughing] We're good BFFs. Let's share secrets. [laughing] This arm belonged to a seamstress. [laughing] Good morning, Alex. You guys look adorable. Dude, I am definitely on your side. No thanks, dude. You can't keep switching sides. You're done. All right. Fine. Then I'm on Alex's side. No, no, no. You're not on my side either. What? No side? No, I can't be side-less. - I gotta find a side. - Keep walking, shorty. [laughs] Well, come on, Alex. It's time to go to school. OK. Well, FrankenGirl, go upstairs and get our sweaters. - Not the matching ones. - [chuckles] No. I see what you're doing. You're using the sweater delay so you don't bring FrankenGirl to school. After I leave, you'll just stay here. It'll work because you can't bear to be late for school. I thought you might think of that. Mom! Dad! Come down from upstairs! Come on, everybody. Gonna be late. It's Manhattan Walk Your Child to School Day. There's no such thing as Manhattan Walk Your Child to School Day. Yes, there is. Justin showed us on his laptop. And if it's on a computer, it's gotta be true. Let's go! OK. We better hurry up because I walk fast! Go! Alex, wait up. Nicely played, Justin, but look around. I am in school and there's no FrankenGirl. - [FrankenGirl growling] - Nice try, Justin. Make the little "grrr" noises to freak me out. Oh, gosh! You forgot your sweater. [laughs] Revenge is so... cozy. How did you find out what school I go to? Funny story. I got list of all schools in New York. But then I realized, with my luck, you would be in last school I looked in, so I just went to last school. [laughs] [crashing] - [laughing] - [laughing] That was nice. Miss Russo, Max tells me you have a new friend. I'm on his side now. Right, um... She's actually a new student. And her name is Frankie Stein. - [laughing] - Frankie Stein. That's a grip that could hogtie a steer. Funny. The office didn't mention any new students. This isn't one of your schemes, is it, Miss Russo? See, this is the part where I pretend I don't know what schemes means. And then you pull out a dictionary and make me look it up. And... Let's just go to your office. Friend of Alex is friend of mine. Let's share secrets. [laughs] OK. [whispering] I don't have a college degree. Whoo! That sure lightened the spiritual load. Thanks. Shh... Wow! Nice save. Destruction of property, getting me out of trouble. I've got a secret. I like you. But don't tell Justin. Wait. - We should tell Justin. - [laughs] Hey, Justin, check this out. In biology class, when they passed out frogs for us to dissect, she ate it. [laughs] Good. How embarrassing for you. You got an F. No, it was hilarious. I mean, I was gonna get an F, anyway. I had mine on a stick, dancing. [laughing] Oh. The nerd store called and they want your face back. [both laughing] Of course. I make her your BFF, she's gonna make fun of me, too. Great. Yep. Looks like your revenge... ...revunged. Oh, come on. "Revunged?" Look it up. [laughing] Hey, guys. Hey. Since it's all, um, working out here, here's something that looks like it would be fun. - Cheerleading tryouts. - Yeah, well, good luck with that, Justin. I'm sure you'll look great in a skirt. [both laughing] Hey, hey. Let's go wreck stuff that's too high for me to reach. Alex doesn't  think cheerleading's cool Make FrankenGirl  a cheerleading fool Alex, I want to go to cheerleader tryouts. Good idea. Let's go make fun of them. No! No. I want to be cheerleader. Yeah, and I wanna graduate in four years, but it's not gonna happen. No! I want to be cheerleader! [grunting] I want to be cheerleader! And if I may... You know what's even better than being a cheerleader, FrankenGirl? Being a cheerleader with your friend. Now, that is total BFF stuff. Come on, Alex. We be cheerleaders together. I think you're the real monster. - Harper? - Alex? [screams] Ah! [panting] What are you doing here? - What are you doing here? - I asked you first. - OK, I'm a cheerleader. - I'm your best friend. How could I not know that you were a cheerleader? Let's see. You've never been to an assembly or a basketball game. The only time you're here after school is when you have to be here, if you know what I'm trying to say. Detention. There, I said it. I am so hurt that you would keep this from me. Friends aren't supposed to keep secrets. Oh! [whispers] Wizard. Wow! Wow, someone's not ever gonna let that one go, are they? Well, I think it's great that you're a cheerleader. Because you can keep FrankenGirl busy - while I sneak out. - OK, ladies. Miss Sauberman and I are here to judge this year's prize heifers. Sorry. Some of these western phrases don't translate so well. Miss Russo, you're trying out for cheerleading? Not exactly the extracurricular I'd expect from you. Oh, but she's gonna do it. Isn't that right, Frankie? [laughing] - Aw! - OK, Justin. You win. I won't sneak into your room again and take anything. I actually believe you. But you're still gonna try out. Mr. Laritate, she's ready! Harper, get the girls ready. All right, buddy up! [FrankenGirl laughing] [cheering] All right. So this is some of your basic steps. Now, let's do this. Ready? OK! - [dance music plays] - [Harper] One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight! [gobbling] Go Turkeys! - [girl yelling] - [screaming] Oh! - Ouch! - She's cut. And... spirit! Well, Justin, I don't know how you did it, but it's true. You got Alex to join an extracurricular. As soon as she found out her best friends were doing it, she couldn't say no. Oh, you really are the perfect son. - Here's some cash for snacks. - I love you. [announcer] A big hand  for what's left  of our J.V. Cheer Squad! Harper Finkel! - [cheering] - Yeah! Whoo! Ow! Yeah! New transfer student,  Frankie Stein! [cheering] And... Alex Russo? - [cheering] - Yeah! [Justin] That's my sister! Let's just get this over with, OK? [dance music plays] [cheering] - Here we go again. - [grunting] - [crashing] - [Alex screaming] [laughing] [Alex] I might be a little late to algebra.
