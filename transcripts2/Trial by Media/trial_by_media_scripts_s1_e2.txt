 [NEWSMAN] And we begin with a story that says something about our times, the story of the subway vigilante. [NEWSWOMAN] To many New Yorkers, this man has become a folk hero. It was the most notorious subway ride in history. [DUNLEAVY] Four teenagers caught a train from the Bronx. They traveled to Manhattan, looking for some big-city excitement. And, boy, did they find it. [NEWSMAN] An event that became an instant metaphor in the American national dialogue about street crime and the limits of self-defense. [SLIWA] The media was doing its job.

 It was fear, fright, hysteria and hype. [NEWSMAN] The case has touched a nerve that has brought it into the national and international spotlight. [SHARPTON] We were able, for the first time, to get the issue of race front and center in the city, in a mass media setting. [DUNLEAVY] The whole bloody world exploded on the newspapers and TV. It was incredible. [SLIWA] When they walked into that car and they started messing with him, they didn't realize… that the time bomb was already ticking. Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.

 [TYPEWRITER CLACKING] [TYPEWRITER BELL DINGS] [DISTORTED SOUNDS] [INDISTINCT ANNOUNCEMENT OVER PA] [TRAIN CAR BRAKES SCREECHING] [INDISTINCT POLICE RADIO CHATTER] [SLIWA] I remember when I first heard about it. I don't even think it had hit the news yet. I was on an Amtrak train, on the number four train. The conductors came up and said, "You didn't hear about the gunman?" He gunned these four black guys on a number two train in Lower Manhattan. [NEWSMAN] A night when police are searching for a gunman. They say that he methodically shot four young men on a crowded 7th Avenue IRT Express. [NEWSWOMAN] A gunman who police say told the conductor of the southbound number two train that the four victims were trying to mug him. And he stated that they tried to rip him off... - Okay. - …and he opened up on them. [NEWSMAN] Four black teenagers pressed him for five dollars. He reportedly told them, "I've got five dollars for each of you." [NEWSWOMAN] Two of his victims are in critical condition tonight, suffering from gunshot wounds in the chest. The other two, shot in the back, are in serious condition. It appeared that he had slunk into the darkness of the tunnel. [DILLON] Quite a few people quite naturally ran from the train. Our initial information was that he jumped between two cars and escaped, uh, into the tunnel, but we're not exactly sure how he got away. He disappeared. He just disappeared. [NEWSWOMAN] The gunman is described as a white man in his late 30s, blond hair, wearing glasses, and neatly dressed in a gray sweater and blue jacket. We're desperately looking for this man. [NEWSWOMAN] Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward announced that for the next two days, there will be almost 1,000 additional police officers monitoring the subway system. [SLIWA] "If it bleeds, it leads." And the quickest way to get news out was the tabloids that would hit the streets at two, three in the morning. [DUNLEAVY] For a newspaper man, it was exciting. Also baffling. We were going nuts... [CHUCKLES] To put it simply. News didn't travel that fast then, but, boy, when it hit, it exploded. If the story is sensational, there's only one way write it, and that's sensationally. [DUNLEAVY] The press, we dubbed him the subway vigilante. [NEWSWOMAN] Police, meantime, are continuing their manhunt for that subway vigilante. [DUNLEAVY] It probably did create in many people's minds what a vigilante gunman would look like. [NEWSMAN] What he did has touched a nerve in New York. [SLIWA] Who is this guy? Is he a New Yorker? Is he a visitor? [DUNLEAVY] Is this guy going to turn up by committing suicide, or is he going to go off on another shooting spree? Or an Army Ranger, or maybe he had served in the military. [DUNLEAVY] The immediate comparison was Charles Bronson... the vigilante killer of people who were bad and naughty. [SLIWA] You know, Bronson was the ultimate macho, maniacal fightback guy. Cold, steely. He got them before they got him. [SIREN WAILING] [POLICE RADIO CHATTER] [NEWSMAN] If you think it's rough out there, you're right. Violent crime rose two percent in New York State last year. [SIREN WAILING] [DUNLEAVY] In those early '80s, New York was horrific. [POLICE RADIO CHATTER] People associated New York "murder capital of America." [SIREN WAILING] Every day, every night, there would be massive, uh, carnage. [POLICE RADIO CHATTER] [DUNLEAVY] And it wasn't, uh, restricted to, uh, Harlem or the South Bronx. I mean, you could get yourself mugged on Fifth Avenue. Well, let's face it. We're all sick and tired of being scared. That's the bottom line. It's about time somebody protected themselves. Nobody's protecting us on the subway. I'm tired of being afraid of riding the subways, and I have to ride the subways. If he was being robbed, hey, he had to do what he had to do. Self-defense, simple as that. [NEWSWOMAN] The Guardian Angels, a volunteer group that patrols subways, believes in self-defense and is asking the mayor to grant temporary amnesty to the subway shooter. [SLIWA] As happens to most New Yorkers at some time in their life in going through the subway tubes that four or five jackals will come up and try to shake you down, that he felt the need to protect himself. [SLIWA] 1979, the city was on the verge of going bankrupt. There were no transit cops. And so, I started the Guardian Angels safety patrols. And we'll risk our life to protect people, do physical interventions, make citizen's arrests. [NEWSMAN] Sunday night, two Angels were arrested by police after they tried to make a citizen's arrest of a man who threatened them with a knife. [SLIWA] The, uh, police, for the most part, felt we were like hemorrhoids in red berets. They couldn't find enough Preparation H to smear on us, hope we dry up and go away. [REPORTER] Once again, a turf dispute between the Guardian Angels and the New York City Police Department has overshadowed the real battle going on in the streets here. And that's between the crack dealers and the people who have to live and work here. [SLIWA] You know, having been shot myself with hollow point bullets, you identified with this gunman, not knowing Jack, diddly squat, anything about him. And immediately, you vilified these four. [SIREN WAILING] I remember when we first saw their images on TV. Troy Canty, Barry Allen, James Ramseur, uh, Darrell Cabey. I was sitting with some Guardian Angels in the headquarters in the Bronx, where I live. So, we know these guys. They worked the number two train all the time. They come down from the Bronx. [NEWSWOMAN] The four young men, ages 18 and 19, all lived in this South Bronx neighborhood. [DUNLEAVY] They had criminal records, but very light. It was criminal mischief they were charged with. [SLIWA] You know, they were a crew. Their whole thing was to sweat you down, approach you. They knew they could intimidate you. [NEWSWOMAN 1] Police say they did find several sharpened screwdrivers in the coat pockets of the victims, screwdrivers sometimes used as weapons or theft tools. [NEWSWOMAN 2] Although they were carrying sharpened screwdrivers, they did not brandish any weapons and have not been charged with any crime. The four victims are being cooperative, and those victims do plan to press charges against the assailant, that if he is found. [DUNLEAVY] New York City cops went through every venue in the world to get any kind of a hint. And really, they didn't have much. Not at all. [NEWSMAN 1] Today, police think they have their man. A man turned himself in and said he is the vigilante. [NEWSMAN 2] Thirty-seven-year-old Bernhard Goetz. [NEWSWOMAN] Bernhard Goetz... [NEWSMAN 3] Bernhard Hugo Goetz... [REPORTER] Mr. Goetz, do you feel you defended yourself justifiably? - [CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING] - [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [DUNLEAVY] If he didn't turn himself in to the Concord cops, we may never, ever, ever have caught him. [NEWSMAN] So tonight, New York City detectives are on their way to Concord to question him and bring him back. He's been arrested and charged with attempted murder, four counts. Unlawful possession of a weapon. Sir, was he cooperative at this point or... Yes, he's been cooperative. Hi. Uh, Mr. Goetz, I'm Assistant District Attorney Susan Braver, and I'm with the New York County Manhattan district attorney's office. And these two gentlemen are Detective Hattendorf of the transit police squad and Detective Clark of the New York City Police Department. You indicated to the detectives here that you would speak with us about this incident. You know, just when I hear New Yorkers speak... I... I don't even want to... [GROANS] - [BRAVER] This is all on videotape. - Sure. [BRAVER] Nothing that's said in this room is off the videotape. - That's... - [BRAVER] For your protection and ours. That's... That's... [DUNLEAVY] Suddenly, Bernie appears, this slightly stooped, gently spoken man with glasses, uh, sandy blond hair. My God. This can't be that crazed subway vigilante everyone was expecting to see. It certainly threw me for a loop. It certainly did. I-I-I just... I-I-I... I told them everything, okay? And I'm not gonna fight it. I'm not gonna fight it. Do you understand? I am not gonna fight this, okay? [NEWSMAN] The accused lives in Manhattan on the fringe of Greenwich Village. [WALTERS] In 1965, Bernhard Goetz enrolled at New York University where he graduated with a degree in nuclear engineering. He operates an electronics testing and repair firm today out of the bedroom and living room of his apartment. For a man some describe as a quiet, frail scientist, it's been quite a day. [NEWSMAN 1] Police here say the suspect, Bernhard Goetz, was mugged and robbed nearly four years ago. [NEWSMAN 2] That mugging by three teenagers may explain his actions earlier this month. Bernie said that he had been mugged on a previous occasion in which he got dusted up pretty good. They deliberately went after my knee. And they got it... I got kicked in the knee. And then what hurts you... They didn't have weapons. You don't have to be maimed with a weapon. What really hurts you is the sidewalk. They tried to push me through a plate-glass door also. You know? And I think he realized he wasn't able to respond. He froze. No. So, listen. If someone kills me... If someone kills me, I don't care, but I just don't want to be maimed. I don't want to be beaten. Being in the streets, I can identify with that... that-that-that-that... That other person in you that will no longer be beaten, robbed, and violated any longer. It's a fightback. It's a call to... And people, instead of rejecting that, actually identified with that. [WALTERS] Why do you think, Mayor Koch, that this has aroused such attention all over the country? Because all over the country, including the city of New York, people have lost faith in the criminal justice system. [NEWSMAN] Today in Washington, a congressional hearing into crime. Senator Alfonse D'Amato says he'll be glad to testify for subway vigilante Bernhard Goetz in his upcoming trial. I've been on that subway when these young... thugs come in there, and they don't even have to approach you. When three or four or five come in, and they start their messing around, they are menacing by their presence. [NEWSMAN] And Bernhard Goetz's name came up during tonight's White House news conference. President Reagan said he could not condone what Goetz did, but he understands the frustration of people who are constantly threatened by crime. It seemed that we got overzealous in protecting the criminal's rights and forgot about the victim. [NEWSMAN] Goetz was brought to the city from New Hampshire today to begin his journey through the criminal justice system. Fundraising efforts are underway to pay his bail and legal expenses. You make it out to the BH Goetz, G-O-E-T-Z, Defense Fund. I was talking to colleagues about the case because it was the subject of discussion far and wide, and I said, "Whoever gets this case is gonna have the case of the century." Little did I know what the good Lord had in store for me and my partner, Barry Slotnick. There were very few big, big criminal cases that they did not have a part in. [BAKER] But there was a dramatic move away from the kind of clientele we were carrying at that particular point in time... gentlemen like John Gotti and other members of organized crime. But from the standpoint... of its evidentiary issues, the media attention, it was just a lawyer's dream. And the stakes were high, which is what defense lawyers look for. Who's that? Who's that guy? That's Bernhard Goetz. [AUDIENCE LAUGHTER] [WHISPERS] He's the subway vigilante. [AUDIENCE LAUGHTER] He looks marvelous. [AUDIENCE LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] [NEWSMAN 1] Technically, this was the first day of freedom for Bernhard Goetz after being released from Rikers Island. It didn't quite turn out that way. [NEWSMAN 2] Outside his attorney's office, reporters mobbed Goetz as he went to the bathroom, then tailed him to the elevator, but none of it yielded any comment from the 37-year-old electronics technician. Have you become the victim now? Are you the victim? [REPORTER] Have you become the victim at this point? In a sense, he is a prisoner of his own sudden notoriety. He can't go anywhere without a reporter or a photographer chasing him. [REPORTER] Anybody want his autograph? Waitresses, several customers asked, and, of course, I told them that I didn't think it was really him. [REPORTER] Just to keep them away from him? - To keep them away. - [REPORTER] Did he ask to be kept away? - Yes. - [REPORTER] Oh, he did. He was right to do what he did. I would have done the same thing. I hope he runs for president. [SLIWA] Every sycophant, toady, and lackey in the world was trying to get a piece of Bernhard Goetz. [ALL CHATTERING] [NEWSMAN] At every public appearance, Goetz is surrounded by more bodyguards than Prince or Michael Jackson at a rock concert. With their own, um, agenda to be served. [NEWSMAN] So popular did Goetz become that fast-buck artists began selling Goetz records and T-shirts. [FELDMAN] There were bumper stickers being sold all across New York and in the subways that read, "Ride with Bernie. He Goetz 'em." - [WOMAN] Did you have a bumper sticker? - I certainly did. Bernie Goetz was being robbed, and thus, he had the right to use a gun to protect himself and, under New York state law, absolutely lawfully. Here in New York, a coalition of groups took advantage of the support for Goetz to push for reform of some laws. The issue? Gun control. The leader of the groups? The National Rifle Association. [NEWSWOMAN] These are legal guns, but under the current laws, a person caught with an illegal weapon could receive a year in prison. Mayor Koch would like that jail term to be mandatory. If you get caught carrying an illegal handgun, you'll go to jail for one year, and there is no way around it. [FELDMAN] The gun Bernie had, he... he obtained in Florida. He brought it to New York illegally because it was very difficult to get a carry license unless you're a big financier, or you're a celebrity, or you're connected to the mayor. I applied for a gun permit with the City of New York after this first incident with my knee happened, and you will have it in your records. Because I'm sure you have it... You've got the fingerprint, the picture, the whole business. I spent about $2,000 and went through all kinds of paperwork. Money doesn't mean all kinds of shit. And when all that is said and done, and I tried to play by all your rules, and you say, "Well, I hated..." I needed the gun because I have a business and this and that, and I tried playing all the games with switching around the money. The detective said, "We can't go giving anybody a gun permit" just because they want it. That would be irresponsible." Bernie Goetz couldn't get a concealed carry license in New York City even though he's exactly the kind of person who should have been able to. So I knew instantly Bernie was gonna be the poster boy for the NRA. At that time, the NRA was still a cause. We used to promote sporting use and hunting. But we were a little hinky about... talking about self-defense. So the Bernie Goetz story was an opportunity on a high-visibility issue for the NRA to weigh in on the side of the victims. [NEWSWOMAN] The NRA wants legislation reintroduced in Albany that would give people greater access to firearm permits. [FELDMAN] So, I got my bosses at NRA to let me do a news conference to get our point of view expressed. And I remembered the line. I said, "The government" which cannot protect its citizens..." has no right to deny them the means to protect themselves. [NEWSWOMAN] The National Rifle Association today began running ads in New York City newspapers, ads that say law-abiding citizens have the right to protect themselves because the city no longer does. [NEWSMAN] Meanwhile, a group of black leaders met with a federal prosecutor to press their demand for a civil rights investigation of the Goetz case. I think that Mr. Goetz was seriously psychologically damaged by former muggings, and that in his mind, that young blacks are the stereotypical-type muggers. I'm firmly convinced if those four boys had been white, he would have not have assumed they were out to mug him until they'd actually tried to mug him. [SHARPTON] If you really felt they were gonna do something to harm you, you get up and show your gun at worst and say, "Leave me alone." But, no, you don't get up and just start firing and shooting four people. How is that self-defense? Other than you're really dealing with this kind of fear and overreaction that is soaked with race and bigotry. Vigilantism is what my mother and my grandmother and them had to run from in the South. The Klan was vigilantes. We fought from Abolitionist Movement all the way through the Civil Rights Movement for the law to protect us. How can we then turn around and embrace those that say, "I'm gonna take the law into my own hands"? And I knew that I was gonna get a lot of backlash, but I was as determined as the other side was that you all are gonna finally have to deal with this issue. I went and started, uh, having my own rallies in Bed-Stuy every Saturday morning. Then I said, to dramatize it, I took 30 young people down in front of his house and would picket and... and have a rally to say any one of these kids could have been on the subway. And the media, uh, picked up on it. We do not think these boys are role models, but we don't think Goetz is either. We think five criminally-minded people met on the subway that day. Obviously, it could be a black-white issue. So I reached out to the guy that I knew I needed to have with me: Roy Innis from the Congress of Racial Equality. It is always right for a man or a woman to defend themselves. It is always right to prevent oneself from being injured by criminals. [NEWSWOMAN] Innis said today that parts of Harlem already resemble Dodge City. Innis said criminals know how to get guns and that law-abiding citizens who are tested and trained should also have that right. [INNIS] Based on what happened to Bernhard Goetz, in a previous mugging, he should have had, uh, a legal permit. He should not be facing criminal charges now. [SHARPTON] And then, the supporters of Goetz started, you know, attacking us, and we were race-baiting, and we were this, that, and the other. There are enough true racist situations that we need to confront. Let us not abuse the trust of the public. You can't condemn the victims when they minded their own business. We have to attack the predators. [BAKER] It galvanized, uh, the citizenry from all corners of the spectrum. Bernie was useful for everybody that had a mission. For those who were fighting racism, he was useful. For those who supported the prevalence of weapons, he was very useful. And those who were crime-fighting, like the Guardian Angels, Bernie Goetz stood as an example of what we all need to do to defend ourselves in town. There was so much passion on both sides, and there was Bernie Goetz in the middle. [NEWSMAN 1] New York subway gunman Bernhard Goetz may be headed for more trouble. One of the victims, Darrell Cabey, already paralyzed from the waist down, suddenly stopped breathing and had to be put on a respirator. [NEWSMAN 2] Family sources told Channel 5 News his condition was described to them by doctors as "a tough pull." The next 48 hours will tell the story. [NEWSMAN 3] If he dies, Goetz could face murder charges. Have you considered the possibility that Darrell was trying to... to mug Goetz? No, I don't... I don't believe, I know... he wasn't out to mug him because before he went into the coma, he told me he was sitting across from him. And, um, he didn't say anything to him or asked him for anything. [NEWSMAN] Lawyers say Cabey's mother has received reams of hate mail and threats from an agitated public. Uh, one we received, it says, "Dear Mrs. Cabey," I'm glad Darrell is paralyzed. He need to sit, uh, his black ass in a wheelchair for the rest of his life. "I'm so sorry that the other three can't join him." Other letters contained overt racial epithets, racial slurs. I mean, how did you react when you got this hate mail? They never stopped to think that it could have been their child, you know. Shirley Cabey came to visit. And she was absolutely horrified that the man who did this to her son is being... lionized as some... as some sort of hero. She's in a state of shock. Uh, she said that... that the whole... the whole thing is just unreal to her. And she said the message that comes out of this is that it's all right, uh, for white people to go out and pick up guns and shoot black people. [KUBY] She recognized the criminal process was ongoing. She didn't particularly trust it. And so, we agreed to... To fight Bernhard Goetz on behalf of Darrell Cabey in civil court. Cabey's mother has filed a lawsuit against Goetz, asking for $50 million in damages. [NEWSMAN] Meanwhile, Goetz's attorney said his client has black friends and is deeply hurt by allegations the shooting was partly motivated by racism. Keeping him on a tight leash was very difficult because the reporters were famished for information. But I'll never forget February 27th, 1985. [NEWSMAN] Documents just made public provide new, possibly explosive information in this case. [BAKER] The district attorney put into the public record statements that he had made on the videotape. [NEWSMAN] Material that gives a graphic description of some of what may have gone on in that subway car when Goetz came face-to-face with the young men. The two were on my right, and the two were on my left. I-I knew, at that point, I would have to pull the gun. When I saw... the... the smile on his face and the shine... and the shine in his eyes, that he was enjoying this, it was at that point I decided I was gonna... kill them all, murder them all, do anything. And the fella who was standing up I was sure I'd shot, he was fine. I-I went... I went to him a second time. I looked at him. And he can't verify this because he was probably out of it by then. If I'd shot him or if he wasn't, I don't know. And I said, "You seem to be doing all right. Here's another." Well, that changed the climate dramatically. How can you reconcile words like, "You don't look too bad. "Here's another," with self-defense? It showed that it wasn't defensive. It was... a cold-blooded attempted execution. [NEWSMAN] The fourth teenager to be shot was Darrell Cabey, who remains semi-comatose at a Manhattan hospital. [SHARPTON] The more and more they got to know who Bernie Goetz was, it began to take the halo off his head. [FELDMAN] One can interpret things he said differently, but as I recall the statement about, "Well, you don't look so bad. Here, have another," that was the problematic one that showed... You know, that... that was a problem. If you're gonna cheer for that, there's something the matter with you. Absolutely, you have no respect for the law. [NEWSMAN] Prosecutors have refused to release the tape, but leaked excerpts from the confession have made banner headlines. I wanted to kill those guys. I wanted to maim those guys. I wanted to make them suffer in every way I could. Look, if I had more bullets, I would've shot them all again and again. My problem was I ran out of bullets. I was gonna... I was gonna gouge one of the guy's eyes out with my keys afterwards. I think we failed in not turning a stronger light sooner on this man and his motivations. We're supposed to be balanced and fair. A knight in shining armor he isn't. [DUNLEAVY] By and large, the Post at the time, we didn't overtly support Bernie Goetz, not overtly. But there was a sense that we had more sympathy for Bernie than, say, the other newspapers had. And that's what led to a series of exclusives. Goetz, who has refused to speak with reporters since he surrendered to authorities in New Hampshire, spent 35 minutes tonight talking with Channel 5 news director John Parsons and New York Post managing editor Steve Dunleavy. [DUNLEAVY] And I got the feeling that the reason why he did the interview was, just in his mind, to set the record straight. [NEWSMAN] Tonight, Bernhard Goetz talks about crime on the streets and what a citizen should do about it in the first in-depth television interview. That was his way of dealing with it. He had to talk about it. I would not have done things differently. Uh, at the same time, I can't talk about it too much because I do have pending criminal charges. And I told him, "Everything you say is gonna come back into that trial," but he was an unguided missile. What we have now is anarchy. When people do violent crime and the criminal judicial system puts them back out on the street, that is anarchy. [SLIWA] All of a sudden, Geraldo Rivera is calling you up... and Barbara Walters. [WALTERS] Last night, we had a takeout Chinese dinner. Goetz just picked at the food. [GOETZ] The person that I met was a very... All four of them were very menacing people. You have to understand that this was a real-life violent situation, and not something that you see on television. People take it for granted that the subway system... is... is a disaster. People take it for granted that... that government agencies... don't do their job. [BAKER] He responded to the media by saying anything and everything to whoever would put a microphone in front of his face. [REPORTER] How do you react to the Police Commissioner who, as a result of looking at all of the evidence, has concluded that perhaps it was not self-defense? The gentleman was shot in the back. And then he realized, "Man, they're out to hang me. They don't understand, Curtis. They don't understand, the media." I said, "The media are not your friends." [INDISTINCT SHOUTING] [GOETZ] I found the press to be some of the most, uh, dishonest, unethical people that I've ever met, with perhaps the exception of politicians, and I've, uh... You know, I've never seen such a group of people with a... a dog-eat-dog attitude. [SLIWA] They're not out to make you a hero any longer. They built you up, and now they're ready to knock you down. The things I said, I believe, and I still do believe. Um, in hindsight, uh... I don't think I should have said them because it, uh... it stirred up everything again. [NEWSMAN] On Monday, a case that has been making news for more than two years will finally go to trial. It's the Bernhard Goetz case. [BAKER] We went from 1984 to 1987 to get to the point of trial, and we knew that this was gonna ultimately be tried not just in the courtroom, but in the court of public opinion with all the media attention. A very large New York courtroom jury selection began in the trial of the so-called subway gunman. [NEWSMAN 1] Lawyers for both sides are not looking for people who don't know about this much-publicized case since attorneys doubt many New Yorkers would fit into that category. [NEWSMAN 2] The relatively large number of potential jurors have experienced the same kind of threatening situation. Goetz says he went through. Of the handful of jurors thus far picked, two say they were victims of subway crimes. Do you have to come back? Yeah. We wanted jurors who were prior mugging victims because we wanted them to be able to relate to Goetz. And the district attorney, he wanted prior mugging victims so he could argue to the jury, "You didn't shoot someone. Why did Mr. Goetz have to?" [REPORTER] I think this could be it. Yeah, I think he's in the front seat. - Mr. Goetz, do you have anything to say? - [HORN HONKS] Anything to say? [HORN HONKS] [NEWSMAN 1] It took the biggest courtroom they have to start the Bernhard Goetz trial today. It's now up to the four women and eight men on the jury to start making up their own minds. [NEWSMAN 2] The prosecutor called Goetz an emotional powder keg with a ferocious and bloody passion. [NEWSWOMAN] Prosecutor Gregory Waples contended Goetz overreacted, that by pulling out an unlicensed handgun and opening fire, he endangered everyone on the subway car. [BAKER] Our adversary was quite a formidable attorney, Greg Waples. We knew we had our work cut out for us because he's a really smart guy. [NEWSWOMAN] Goetz's attorney Barry Slotnick argued that as a victim of a previous mugging, Goetz had acted rationally and that he believed deadly force was necessary. [SLIWA] Bernhard Goetz was represented by Slotnick and Baker, two of the best. They were masterminds in taking a hopeless case, like Bernard Goetz, and actually finding the light at the end of the tunnel. [NEWSMAN] Goetz's lawyer Barry Slotnick developed a strategy of shifting the focus from Goetz to the four youths he shot. Mark Baker and Barry Slotnick did everything possible in that courtroom to demonize the victims of the crime. I will be prosecuting those four thugs that ventured upon Bernhard Goetz and meant to do him ill will and rob him. I don't understand why they weren't prosecuted. At one point, Barry Slotnick, in a genius legal maneuver, had four of the black African-American Guardian Angels dress up in white T-shirts, and he used them to role-play in the court. [NEWSMAN] Goetz's lawyer recreated the shootings with the aid of a ballistics expert. The four Guardian Angels were placed in positions where the defense says the four teens were located when they were shot. A private investigator played the part of the so-called subway gunman. So I told the Guardian Angels, "Act the way these guys act. Act like thugs, like we see it all the time on the trains." Mad dogging him and eye fornicating him. The judge, who should never have allowed that to begin with, was, like, really fascinated with this. The court was fascinated with this. And then Waples was screaming at the judge. "What are you doing? You can't allow this. It's gonna prejudice the jury." [HORN HONKS] [OVERLAPPING SHOUTING] We would escort Bernhard Goetz from his apartment on 14th Street to the court. He did not have the SUV. He did not have the stretch limo. He took the train most times. And people would talk a lot of trash, and they'd want to spark it up. And then you had demonstrators outside for and against Goetz, and they'd be arguing. [DEMONSTRATORS] Bernhard Goetz! KKK! Different name, same game. We hope to see Goetz convicted because he presumed that because they were black, they were criminal. At times, it was like a three-ring circus. [DUNLEAVY] I was there every day for the New York Post. It was just riveting, everything. [NEWSMAN] Bernie Goetz doesn't say much when he walks past the press into court every day, maybe just a greeting. His lawyers don't want him talking about the case. They probably think Bernie has said enough already. My biggest effort was keeping him muzzled. We knew we didn't want Bernie Goetz to testify in an open courtroom 'cause I don't think he would have lasted 20 seconds on cross-examination. So it was gonna come down to the tape. [NEWSMAN] In court today, Bernhard Goetz's own confession came back to haunt him. [NEWSWOMAN] The prosecutor, who said Goetz was actually the aggressor, introduced Goetz's videotaped confession and told the jury it was self-incriminating. I was going downtown to have a drink before Christmas with a few friends and just do some bullshitting for a while. I was in the middle of a project. I got disgusted with it. I was working on a piece of equipment. I said, "Well, I'd better take a break." I went on that train... When I walked in there, I was as lighthearted as can be. But the situation develops... very... Now, this... this takes a long time to explain. - [CLARK] We understand... - [GOETZ] Look, they... What they were going to do is enjoy me for a while. They were going to beat the fucking shit out of me. Okay? The money and this and that is all bullshit. When I saw his look, I knew what their intentions were. And-and-and-and I snapped, and I said, "I'm gonna waste them." Used, you know, the phrase, "I'm gonna waste them all." It was just... It was... It was... attempted cold-blooded murder. I don't deny that, and if you're gonna pass judgment on that, good. [BAKER] After it was played in court and you could hear a pin drop, my partner said, "We're dead." I said, "What? What do you mean we're dead? It went off just as we anticipated." You've got to remember, we don't have to prove innocence. We just have to create a doubt as to guilt. And we thought the tape did that. Anybody who's seen that tape will have one opinion or another. I always found it sympathetic. It was raw... emotion about somebody who had feared to be beaten to a pulp and took action and happened to have a gun on him. And the truth is ugly, it's disgusting... and I was a monster. I don't deny it. But I wasn't a monster until several years ago in New York. He virtually put the era on trial. You're gonna wipe the floor with me. I know it. Okay? You... You have to, and the reason you have to is so many rules have been broken. If you don't, what does this imply? If you say this wasn't wrong, it means people have to carry guns in New York, and the city will never admit that. And he punched home, time and time again. Weren't we fed up? The city is so concerned about violence? Good. This is "the most violent crime of the year." Great. New York City doesn't give a damn about violence. Otherwise, this would have never happened. [NEWSMAN] Goetz tells how he gunned down three of his four shooting victims, who he says surrounded him, asking for money. But this case is largely about the shooting of the fourth teenager, Darrell Cabey. By Goetz's own taped admission to police, he paused long enough to evaluate that Cabey was not injured. [NEWSWOMAN] According to Waples, Goetz viciously went over to him and shot him. A bullet left Cabey paralyzed and brain damaged. And I said, "You seem to be doing all right. Here's another." [NEWSMAN] Goetz's lawyer said that Goetz imagined the circumstances of the Cabey shooting and actually shot all four youths in rapid succession. [BAKER] Our argument was that this is what he thought he would have done, but not what he did. [NEWSMAN] So far, eight government witnesses, six who were in the same car as Goetz, and two who were in the adjacent car, have testified that they heard Goetz fire four or five times very rapidly. [BAKER] I don't think the district attorney expected or anticipated that each one of these subway witnesses would be turned into a defense witness. [NEWSMAN 1] Over and over again, Slotnick told the jury that witnesses testified that they heard the shots fired in rapid succession, an argument that, in many ways, is at the heart of the defense case. [NEWSMAN 2] After spending the night sequestered in an undisclosed hotel, the Goetz jury arrived at court at about ten o'clock this morning. [RATHER] Goetz went on trial, charged with 13 counts including attempted murder. Today, in its fourth day of deliberation after a seven-week trial, a jury brought in its verdict. [BAKER] I remember standing up when that jury walked in. My knees were literally shaking. I had trouble just standing. And then... I got very emotional. [NEWSMAN] The most controversial case of crime to come out of New York subways is finally over this evening. Bernhard Goetz has been acquitted on all charges of attempted murder and assault. The man who shot four black youths on a New York City subway two and one half years ago was convicted only of illegal possession of a gun. [NEWSWOMAN] When the verdicts were read today in court, Goetz stood and quietly said, "I'm happy. That's good." [DUNLEAVY] Oh, the courtroom was... crazy. It went crazy. And we went crazy too... trying to get it as fast as we could. [NEWSMAN] Throughout the trial, the prosecutor refused to talk about the case. At a news conference following the verdict, he barely spoke at all. [OVERLAPPING SHOUTING] - [MAN 1] He's afraid to talk. - [MAN 2] Run away! - [MAN 1] He's running away from the press! - [MAN 2] Run away! [BAKER] Greg Waples, he was from the Midwest, and I think he read the citizens of New York wrongly. [MAN 3] Run for dogcatcher, prick. [BAKER] During summation, he made an argument that if Mr. Goetz doesn't like the crime in New York, he should leave. You don't tell that to a New Yorker. [CROWD SHOUTING] [NEWSMAN] The Guardian Angels, who had stood by Bernhard Goetz from the beginning, were with him to the end. Back up. Excuse me. Back up. [CROWD SHOUTING] Back up. Back it up. [SLIWA] From the first day I heard the opening arguments, I said, "They're not gonna convict this guy. They're not." I looked in the faces of those jurors, the men and women, and you could see when there was testimony about victimization, ooh, it resonated. [MAN 1] Right on. [MAN 2] Stand on the pedestal, Barry! [REPORTER] How big a victory is this for you? I-I would not like to characterize it as a personal victory. I did the best I could in the courtroom, and hopefully that was more than adequate. [REPORTER] How big a loss for the DA? [NEWSWOMAN] With such an explosive case, no matter what the jury decided, there was sure to be strong reaction from the public. [CROWD CHANTING] Hell no, we won't go! Hell no, we won't go! Hell no, we won't go! Hell no, we won't go! Hell no, we won't go! [SHARPTON] It was disappointing. I felt that it reduced the worth of all of us. [NEWSWOMAN] From the steps of City Hall to the streets of Harlem, many black leaders today were angry with the Goetz verdict. Bernie Goetz says we can all fight back. What he really means is we can fight black. He's the personification of the white backlash of the law. 'Cause really, what you're saying is we can have the maximum injuries, and it doesn't matter, that the law is not gonna say, "But there's value in this life, and you can't take it or injure it." [NEWSWOMAN] The group, headed by the Reverend Al Sharpton, will start policing the subways, guarding black citizens against what it calls vigilantes. [SHARPTON] We put the patrol out there because we didn't want to see blacks react violently. A lot of blacks said we should get guns now since Goetz can carry a gun. Whether you agree or disagree with the, uh, outcome, you must accept it. The verdict was a shock to a lot of people. It wasn't a surprise to me, and it shouldn't have been a surprise to anybody who was following the case very closely. There was a white angry mob mentality. We saw that the jury was ten white people. [NEWSMAN] Juror Mark Lesly was asked if race played any part in the deliberation room. No, we didn't consider it even in the slightest bit, not even in, uh, a tangential way. It was about a man and four other men in the subway. It... It, uh... The fact that he was white and they were black is immaterial. We had facts and evidence to base all this on, and the charges from the judge, and... and none of that had anything to do with white and black. I think the true message is that people have a right to protect and defend themselves under justifiable situations. And quite clearly, that's what Bernhard Goetz was all about. It's now over. He's been acquitted, and it's finished. [BAKER] Four years of work had been completely vindicated. But then we were facing sentencing. He was still convicted of the gun possession. It's upsetting because, you know, this case is now four years long and the last thing he should be is in jail. [FELDMAN] The forces of government, they were interested in punishing Bernie Goetz and saying, "By God, we'll make sure that nobody else can use a gun lawfully that wasn't registered." [NEWSMAN] Prosecutor Gregory Waples said Goetz was a danger to himself and society. Bernhard Goetz disagreed. This case, uh... is really more about deterioration in society than it is about me. Gregory Waples, uh... seems to be concerned that society needs to be protected from me. And, uh, I don't believe that's the case. Society needs to be protected from criminals. [NEWSMAN] Judge Stephen Crane was not convinced, passing sentence of a year in jail and a $5,000 fine. [SLOTNICK] Your Honor, I've advised the defendant of his right to appeal. He's ready to go to jail. [BAKER] There's a straight year sentence that's mandatory in New York. So he went to Rikers Island. And one year is really eight months with good time credit, so he was out in eight months. [OVERLAPPING SHOUTING] [NEWSMAN] Goetz still faces a $15 million civil suit that was filed by one of his shooting victims who has been left brain damaged and paralyzed. The marginalizing of the worth of a black life when you act like he's incidental to a hero's story. The legal precedent was a threat to all of us and had to be addressed. [SLIWA] By the time the civil case was brought up, the city had changed measurably. We realized that the city was almost out of control at that point. In 1987, the changes that we now see had not occurred. American cities can't survive as we know them if they remain so violent. [KUBY] As crime started to go down, people spent a little more time looking at trying to create civil society. [NEWSWOMAN] Now, more than 11 years later, Bernhard Goetz, a private man, finds himself back in the spotlight and the courtroom again. [SLIWA] And then, he picks up this new lawyer. We live in an era where we have almost, what I call, a form of liberal McCarthyism where, instead of yelling "communist," you yell "racist." Bernie Goetz still runs a small electronics business, but his lawyer says he's spent a quarter of a million dollars on legal fees and has no savings. [KUBY] The goal wasn't to win money. I mean, we all knew that Goetz was... was impoverished. He says he's broke. You don't expect to get any $50 million, - even if you win the suit, do you? - I don't expect to get that, but there are a lot of other white bigots with guns out there, and there has to be a message sent to them, which is sooner or later, even if it takes ten or 12 years, we're gonna come after you, and we're gonna get you, and we're gonna make you pay, and so you'd better just keep it in your holster. What we needed was sort of a very public vindication of... of Darrell Cabey. He's permanently paralyzed from the waist down. Uh, that'll never get better. He came out of it with severe, permanent, irreversible brain damage. He functions at the level of a small child. And a very, very public exposure of who Bernhard Goetz really was through his own mouth. [NEWSMAN] Bernhard Goetz never took the witness stand at his trial, but he can be compelled to give a deposition for the civil suits against him. All the Bernhard Goetz you can stomach and more, day after day after day. [NEWSMAN 1] A largely white Manhattan jury acquitted Goetz of attempted murder in 1987. [NEWSMAN 2] But the two-time defendant's civil case will be tried in the Bronx before a jury of four blacks and two Hispanics. City state and zip code for the record. Uh, Bernhard... Goetz. [SLIWA] Kuby takes out his... you know, his razor, his straight-edge razor, and just cut him up. [KUBY] When you attended a... a meeting of a building association in 1980 to discuss issues of cleaning up 14th Street, did you make a comment at that meeting? Uh, yes, I... Oh, I-I made several statements, uh, but, uh, I did... I did make a, uh, a stupid comment, uh, for which I'm ashamed and I've apologized for. Would you tell the jury what that stupid comment was, please? In effect, I said, uh... "The only way we're going to clean up this street, uh, is to get rid of the niggers and the spics." Mr. Goetz, is it true that you said, "The guys I shot represented the failure of society"? - Yes. - [KUBY] And you also said, "Forget about their ever making a positive contribution to society." Is that correct? I consider them to be a situation to be a guaranteed formula for disaster, for misery. Goetz gets up there on the witness stand and just spews his consciousness. You know, it's sort of like, what is this, your psychiatrist here? You're pouring out everything. You also think it would have been a lot better, had Shirley Cabey had an abortion. Isn't that right? Shirley Cabey specifically, it would probably be better than the present status quo we have today. He dug himself, uh, a grave, and you couldn't just let him now walk out feeling that there were no consequences for his actions. Award enough in punitive damages. If you bankrupt every other bigot with a gun out there who decides to take another shot at another kid like Darrell Cabey... [JUDGE] I'm going to read the question and the answer... that has been recorded, and then ask you, "Is that your verdict?" Question number one. Do you find that the defendant intended to shoot Darrell Cabey? The answer has been recorded as yes, six-zero. Juror number one, was that your verdict? [KUBY] When ultimately the jury returned a... A liability verdict of $43 million... I-I think Darrell Cabey can get from Berhard Goetz, um, everything Bernhard Goetz has. And so if Bernhard Goetz wins the lottery, Darrell Cabey wins the lottery. If Bernhard Goetz, uh, writes a book, Darrell Cabey gets the profits. [SLIWA] Even though Kuby won, he hasn't collected a nickle, dime, or penny. Goetz declared bankruptcy shortly after that, but... but what Shirley Cabey was after was what happened the next day. Lead editorial in The Daily News... "No hero, never was." [NEWSWOMAN] New York tabloids dubbed him as a vigilante and the "Death Wish" gunman. [NEWSMAN] His action touched a responsive chord in the imaginations not only of New Yorkers but the nation. I've covered a lot, a lot of murder trials and, uh, I'd never seen anything quite like that, never before or never since. [NEWSMAN] But the arguments will continue. Was Bernhard Goetz a mugging victim who defended himself or a trigger-happy racist? [SHARPTON] As you go through life, you see that a lot of what wasrisky and unpopular becomes accepted. That's what movements do is you shift the argument, but some people have to take the risk to change the conversation. Now, the fact that we made some progress is encouraging. The fact that we haven't arrived is what energizes us to keep going. The Bernie Goetz instance was one of those seminal events that helped propel the NRA to political power. The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun. [FELDMAN] But it was a very different NRA in 1984 compared with, uh, the NRA at the moment. [NEWSWOMAN] It is a story that continues to open wider and wider a Pandora's box of thorny issues and a simmering debate over just who is really the victim: Bernhard Goetz, or the four men he shot, or both. [SLIWA] Look who's here. - It's Bernhard Goetz, the subway gunman. - [GOETZ] Yeah, hi, Curtis. Hi, Dominick. [DOMINICK] Hi, Bernie. Nice to hear from you. [GOETZ] Okay, well, thank you. [DOMINICK] Bern, so here's the million-dollar question. Do you regret it all these years later? - [GOETZ] Regret what? - [DOMINICK] Regret the shooting. - [GOETZ] Pulling the trigger? - [DOMINICK] Yes. [GOETZ] Well... [DOMINICK] Shooting those black young men. [GOETZ] Well, I don't think it's the type of thing you regret. [SLIWA] See that, Dominick? [DOMINICK] So, wait. So, you don't regret it? [GOETZ] No. No. There are many things in my life that I... I regret, and I make many... I've made many blunders. I-I don't think that was one of them. [SLIWA] I could be in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro. I can be in Cape Town. The number one question I get asked: "Whatever happened to that subway gunman?" That's the kind of imprint he left on people's minds all over the world. And then, naturally, I have to catch 'em up. He lives in the same apartment. He rides the trains. He walks out in the streets. I know he tried to run for mayor a couple of years ago. He's got very strong political opinions. [SLIWA] He's vegan. You know, he smokes his Maui Wowie and his Hindu Kush. He's got his squirrels. He's in his own little world. He's harmless. But on that day... [REFLECTIVE MUSIC PLAYS] Surf the internet with browser of future osdb.link/brave
