 ["I'm Moving" playing] ♪ I feel like I'm always moving away ♪ [woman] I have to keep reminding myself... just because you're good at something, doesn't mean it's good for you. Sounds obvious, right? Just kind of clicked for me. A real moment of clarity. You know? [exhales] Thanks for listening, guys. It feels good to put our truths into the universe. You heard anything else?

 Just that the police were involved. [woman] Okay, well. Enough about me. - [phone vibrates] - Who else wants to go up and share today? ♪ You know that it's all so scripted ♪ ♪ Outside ♪ Hi, I'm Moe. [all] Hi, Moe. And, uh... I'm not a shoplifter. I'm sorry, I lied to you, but all I want to do now is tell you the whole truth. I have been coming here under false pretenses. I have never shoplifted. Then why are you even here?

 I took the fall for my brother's friend. I was a minor and he wasn't, so he would have been screwed. - Oh, you're such a good person. - Yeah, way better than us. Ladies, It's not a Real Housewives dinner party. Coming here just felt... oddly therapeutic. So I just kept coming even after I didn't have to. It just made me feel like I was okay. You know? Not really. [woman clears throat] Moe. While this show of honesty is amazing... you three need to take this outside. Way to hijack the meeting, Moe. I didn't know how else to get your attention. Guys, look, I know I should have told you sooner, but I didn't want to mess things up between us and clearly... I called that one wrong. I really want to make things right. I trusted you. I showed you my stash, and the whole time you were just judging me. No, it wasn't like that. I thought we were friends. It was all bullshit. I can't listen to this. - So, I take it you feel the same? - I don't know, Moe. - This is really messed up. - I get it. I'm sorry. Look, I shoplift and I don't want anyone knowing. Why would you want people to think you shoplift if you don't? Ever since my dad went to jail, everyone just expects the worst of me. So, I guess I figured if I could just control the story... Also, it really wasn't the worst to see you again. You should have trusted us. I know. I'm really sorry. Just give us some time. [phone chimes] This is cruel and unusual punishment. Yeah, well, welcome to being grounded. Did you know there was a car stolen from the school parking lot? Yeah. Everybody does. - Um, how did you hear? - Your school sent an email. They've set up a police hotline in case anyone has information. Well, I don't. They found the car in the lake. That's crazy. Listen, I am working a booth with Jenna at the school night market. Okay. But we need someone to watch Spencer there. I'd rather fold his underwear. Well, you're not exactly in a position to say no right now. Fine. El, uh, one more thing. You know the deposition's been rescheduled for Monday, right? Does it have to be so soon? We can't keep putting it off. Maybe it'd help if you write it down. You know, just get it all out. - I can help if you want. - No, I got it. Okay. So this is actually happening? Just for a little bit, while we sort things out. So, what? You guys gonna sort things out over the phone? Your mom asked me to give her some space. - I'm respecting... - What do you know about respect? Hey. How could you do this to us? ["Holding On" playing] ♪ I'm not shy to say Even when it's wrong ♪ ♪ But what's keepin' me from holdin' on? ♪ ♪ I'll be thinkin' of you Even when you're gone ♪ ♪ But what's keepin' me from holdin' on? ♪ [phone chimes] ♪ There's no shame in letting go ♪ ♪ Don't wanna hold on to you If you're happy alone ♪ ♪ But if you're thinkin' about me Tell me, 'cause I'm right here all alone ♪ ♪ I'm not shy to say Even when it's wrong ♪ ♪ But what's keepin' me from holdin' on? ♪ ♪ I'll be thinkin' of you Even when you're gone ♪ ♪ But what's keepin' me from holdin' on? ♪ Moe, hey. Hey. Uncle Carl. Is my dad around? He said he was staying here. Uh, he is, but he's not here right now. You wanna come in and wait? How long do you think he'll be? I'm not sure. I don't keep a tracker on him or anything. Considering he just got out of jail, maybe you should. Yeah. Uh, you know what, can you just tell him I came by? He has my number. Okay. [knocking on door] Hey, baby. Hey. This is all my fault. - What are you talking about? - I shouldn't have told you about dad. - No. - But for real... Tabitha... I already knew. What? It's a conversation I never wanted to have with you. Wait, so I don't get it. You were okay with it? - Of course not. - Why did you let it happen? I figured keeping my family together was more important. Just finding out that you knew... [sighs] It's like a wake-up call. I'm sorry. No. You have nothing to feel sorry about. I'm sorry. We deserve better. So, what do you say? Let's get ready for night market. Mom, do we have to? No, but... what else are we going to do? Sit around here... mourning somebody else's poor choices? No. We ain't no basic bitches, so. - [chuckles] - Right. Come on. [chuckles] - I love you, Mom. - I love you too, baby. Whoa! - That's really good. - This looks amazing. Okay, so, we will be working at the SCOBY booth. - What's SCOBY? - Symbiotic culture, bacteria and yeast. - Ew. - Cool. You know, it's how you make kombucha. Ready? You know where to find us, you're in charge. Have fun. Can I get a vegan bánh mi? Vegan bánh mi? Really, buddy? Mom, are you sure you want to be here? I'm okay if you're okay. Ooh, I'm feeling vase phase coming on. Mom, how about going one day without posting a photo? Deal. Hey. Hey. - What's up? - You know... Mom's buying a vase... Dad's moving out. Just a regular weekend. Shit. I'm sorry. Just feels like everything's changing really fast. Kind of ironic. Your dad is leaving and mine's just coming back. He got out? Yeah, a few days ago. I haven't told my mom yet. [indistinct chatter] [boy] When's our turn? One second sooner than the last time you asked me. [sighs] Let's check this out first. Do we have to? [sighs] [indistinct chatter] Shit. - Hey, Mr. D. - Hey, Moe. I got to run. The line for donuts is getting really long and it's my cheat day. You got into a STEM program in Korea next semester? This is true. When were you going to tell me? I was just... figuring it out. Yeah, I... I didn't really know how to break the news. Break the news? This isn't a bad thing. What? So you're not upset? No! Why would I be? Oh, I am proud of you. Yeah, but this means I'm gonna leave you. I am the adult here, remember? I'll be fine. Well... it kind of seems like adults are never fine. But I guess I will take your word for it. I don't feel good. Bud, I told you all that popcorn wasn't a good idea. Can we go outside? It's kind of hot in here. Yeah. Give me a second. ["Trouble Adjusting" playing] ♪ I think I'm having trouble adjusting ♪ ♪ How am I to do it again ♪ ♪ If I can't Easy for you, I'm still adjusting ♪ Okay, Spencer. ♪ I walk into an empty room ♪ ♪ Girl looks at me, says Who the hell is she? ♪ ♪ I think I'm having trouble adjusting ♪ Spencer? Spencer? Spencer? I've always liked you in blue. Hey, I was, uh... I was thinking maybe we'll get some dinner at your dad's Stanford alumni reception. Brady, we broke up. Consider yourself uninvited from everything at my house. The head of admissions is gonna be there. - I mean, you know... - It's not my problem. Look, I... - I just miss you. - [phone chimes] I've moved on. You should too. - [exhales] Why did you bring her? - I want to help. What happened? One minute Spencer was next to me, and the next he was gone. Where were you? I was distracted. I'm such an idiot. You're not an idiot. He's probably with your dad and stepmom. My dad just called to check in. I think maybe he went outside. He wasn't feeling well. Let's split up. I'll look inside and you two look out here. Okay. He's in a blue jacket. We're gonna find him. It's gonna be okay. ["Outshine" playing] Spencer! Spencer! Spencer? Spencer. Spencer? [Spencer] Hello? Spencer! Are you in there? [Spencer] Can anyone hear me? - Spencer? - [Spencer] Hello? I think he's in there. - Spencer? - Spencer! - [Spencer] Elodie? - Spencer! Spencer! - [Spencer] Elodie! - Spencer? - Are you in there? - [Spencer] Elodie? Hey, are you okay? [Spencer] I'm stuck! Hold on. [Spencer] Over here. I can't get my seatbelt... - Damn buckle. - Hey, bud. Hey. I can't get out. Okay. [Elodie grunts] Hey, it's okay. You're okay. - What's wrong, sweetie? - Mom, I was so scared. - I was lost. - Wait. What? You... You lost him? I mean, just for a second. He wandered off. You were supposed to be watching him. What the hell is wrong with you? [sighs] There's something wrong with me. - Hey, no, that's not... - I ruin everything. It's my fault. Even mom. What? Your mom was killed by drunk driver. You had nothing to do with her accident. No, you don't get it. If I hadn't called her to pick me up early from that party... that never would've happened. Elodie, is that what you really think? That was not your fault. Do you hear me? Every morning I wake up... and for a split second... I forget. - I just miss her so much. - Come here. [knocking at door] - Hey. - Sorry I'm late. It's okay, my mom is still out. Wow. When you said to meet at your house, I wasn't expecting this. Well, it's my parents. It's not me. I feel stupid letting you go on and on about my shitty little apartment, when this is where you live. No, your apartment's not shitty. It's yours. That's all that matters. Come here. [laughs] [thunder crackling] Hey. I want to do the deposition. For Mom. Okay. That's all. [phone ringing] - Paula? - Hey, Moe, are you free? Uh, yeah. Why, what's up? Can you get down to the restaurant? It's an emergency. - What happened? - Just get down here. [soft music playing in background] What is all this? I hear the cherry blossoms in Seoul are supposed to be pretty epic, and... I was wishing I get to see them with you. So... you get it. I don't want to make any excuses, okay? I'm sorry. All I want is you. Yeah, you say that... - but... - I mean it. Yeah, but once you have me... maybe you won't want me anymore. Don't you see? I'm here. I'm not going anywhere. Like, you live at Paula's now? Yeah, if that's what it takes. I'll be missing you like crazy, but I'll be right here waiting for you when you get back. [speaking Korean] - Excuse me? - It means... "I maybe love you too." In Korean. Shit. You're good. [camera beeps] [woman] Do you solemnly swear to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God? I do. Please, state your full name for the record. Elodie Davis. And are you aware why you're being deposed? Yes. Okay. Let's begin. [Spencer making racing noises] Red takes over the lead, black is gaining fast. He hits the turn. He loses control. [Jenna] Spencer! Come get washed up for dinner! [theme music playing]
