 I don't know. I think you should save those. He might want them one day. Mom, it's just a photo. When I was your age, I had a shoe box full of ex-boyfriend's stashed away. - Just got off the phone with Dad. - Let me guess. He's stuck in Seattle. Yeah, his investor presentation got pushed. Shocker. So. How about we make a day out of it? You and me this afternoon? Any treatment you want. I don't know. I'm not really in the mood. Oh, Tabbie, come on. You have to move on sometime. - Mom, Brady and I just broke up. - Tabitha, trust me. You're only young once. Please don't waste it feeling sad and sorry for yourself. Morning. Spencer, did you take my graphing calculator again? No, I swear. Sit. I'll get you a bowl of oatmeal, I put chocolate chips in it today. I'm not hungry. You can't just go around taking my stuff. - [Doug] Are we good? - [Jenna] Yeah. [Doug] Uh... Oh. Let's see. What is this? [sighs] Yeah, I've been meaning to talk to you. Your mom's accident. There's going to be a trial. What do they want from me? Well, they need your account of what happened. It all happened so fast, I don't even remember. The other driver's blood alcohol was three times the legal limit. I know this must be a lot, but I'll walk you through everything. You don't even have to go, you just have to record your statement with a lawyer. Dad, I have to get to school. ["Fun" playing] ♪ I wanna go out ♪ ♪ Dress up real nice and find someone ♪ ♪ Who's ready to run ♪ ♪ But, most of all I wanna have some fun ♪ [chuckles] Oh, no. Sick Mitsubishi. [laughs] Oh, the mighty have fallen. ♪ I wanna have some fun, fun, fun ♪ You know what, dude? Just don't fucking start. What do you think you're doing? Why are you always creeping up on me? You want me to stop? No. Cool. You know Brady's car got stolen during the game last night? Maybe someone got mad that douche is always parking in the handicap spot. No one... is going to think twice if they see us at the bike racks, We're not the center of everyone's universe. Maybe I should stop being so conceited, then. Yeah, I mean... I think you're pretty great. - But... - Finish that sentence. Lemme get one kiss. One. You're going to have to work a little harder than that for a kiss. I'll work hard for kisses. Speaking of which... Yes? I was wondering if you would... go to the dance with me. Have we entered an alternate reality? What? Me and you go public? Not to mention you know for a fact, I would not be caught dead at that dance. I know, right, but it's like... [laughs] You gotta be the change you hope for and all that. - Hm? Right? - Right. What about a low-key date though? Blush. How low-key? Dinner, movie. Maybe make it to first base. - Over the shirt or under the shirt? - Over? Give me that 1952 shit. - [chuckles] - Okay. For real? For real. [laughs] So will you? It would be an honor to go with you. It's going to be a magical night. And when the game was over, the car was just gone. I heard Brady was actually crying. Whoever stole it is fucking awesome. [Elodie] I can't stop thinking about it. What we did was crazy. [Moe] Brady will be fine. He'll get past it. And you should too. Do you think he called the cops? Elodie, are you serious? His car is missing. Yes. - He called the cops. - And no one saw us. No one has reason to believe that it was us that took the car in the first place. You need to stop torturing yourself. - I don't know if I can. - Just take a deep breath. Look, I'm tired of talking about Brady. He got what he deserved. She's right. And guys, seriously, we can't talk about this. Like, ever. I think I gotta get outta here. Do you guys wanna skip? Nah. I try to go to class these days. Will I see you guys at the meeting? Yeah. Look... it's gonna be okay. So, who are your options for the dance? Well... I'm thinking about not going. I'm sorry, not computing. [scoffs] You've never missed a dance. So... you didn't hear this from me, but... Hayden is just trying to get the balls to ask you. Interesting. Are you ever going to tell me what happened between you and Brady? You've been so vague. Look, I don't wanna get into it right now. I wonder who he's going with anyway. Yesterday, he posted a pic on Instagram with that one... Wait, you still follow him? - Why wouldn't I? - Because we broke up. I've been friends with him longer than I've been friends with you. So, should I give Hayden the green light? [whistle blares] [whistle blaring] [phone ringing] [female voice] This is a collect call from Two Rivers Correctional Institute. Will you accept the charges to speak with... [male voice] Danny Truax? [female voice] Please press one for yes or two for no. [Sophie] Get outta the way, Moe. Fuck off, Sophie. [school bell rings] I was there, I heard it. - Yo, have you seen Noah? - No. You okay? Hey, Tabitha, how's it going? It's going. So, I've kinda had a crush on you since, like, ninth grade, but... you've always been spoken for. So now I was wondering if you wanted to go to the dance together? - Sure. - Sweet. See you later. [music playing] [Mara] Hi, pumpkin. I'm at the market, wondering about dinner. How do we feel about meatloaf? Good, gross? Let me know. Bye. Hi, hi, hi. I'm running late. Um, please don't forget to record The Bachelor. Don't judge me. Hey, kiddo. Just checking on how that history test went. By now it is history, so yay. - Let's celebrate later, okay? - [muffled] Miss Davis. I love you. Bye. [clear] Miss Davis? Planning on joining us? Okay, everybody, settle in, come on. I'll be handing out assignments at the end of class today, because I'll be at a conference next week, okay? Great. Now that you've all completed or should have completed Sylvia Plath's, The Bell Jar, let's discuss the larger themes of feminism in the work, and the creation of alter egos and the... Elodie, hand it over. - What? - Your phone. - I can put it away. - Miss Davis. - It's my phone. - It's my classroom. You can pick your phone up at the end of the day in Mr. Dunford's office. And you'll need to have your parents sign that. Okay, where were we? Ah. Alter egos. The heroin has two of them in the book. [student] Oh, it's stuck. You're so funny. [laughs] [Noah] Well, he can't shoot, I know that. - [Noah] He cannot shoot. - Okay. - This guy? - Yeah. I'm the best. I am the best. There you are. Where have you been? I've been texting you like an idiot. I needed you. - Whoa, whoa. Calm down. - Look. Why don't you just go find some chill girl to take to the dance and just leave me alone? Wait. What? Moe, stop. ["Desolate Town" playing] ♪ I've been feeling all right ♪ ♪ After what went down ♪ ♪ Well, no, I have no friends ♪ ♪ In the desolate town ♪ ♪ And I don't wanna let you in ♪ ♪ No, I don't wanna let you in ♪ How many items? Eight. ♪ But you in the summer ♪ ♪ Well, I was in a take 'bout you ♪ ♪ Just on a daydream ♪ ♪ Why am I not surprised ♪ ♪ Bashing through ♪ ♪ This desolate light ♪ - [knock at door] - [salesgirl] Everything okay in there? Uh-huh. I mean, yeah. Thanks. [rattling] Okay, let me know if you need any help. Okay. [exhales] [phone chimes] So, it's been a year now, which... feels kind of crazy. [chuckles] And... I mean, it's not that I don't think about stealing... I just... remind myself that you know, there are ways to cope. Thank you. Um... I'm Tabitha. [all] Hi, Tabitha. And I'm a shoplifter. Yesterday I lifted something, and I guess I feel... kind of shitty. Stealing used to feel like... getting gifts on Christmas or something. But once you find out Santa's not real, it's kind of hard to pretend that he is. I mean, I guess I'm just... I guess I'm just tired of pretending that things are perfect when they're not. It feels like everyone expects me to be a certain way. But what if I stopped? It's depressing enough we have to be here... You'd think they'd not put out the same shitty snacks. Hey. [Moe] Yo, you all right? Yeah, I guess I'm just... processing. Well, you were with Brady for two years. Not just that, it's... my entire family is fucked. And I feel like I'm just now starting to realize that. - Better late than never. - Yeah. I mean, I know I'm supposed to be mad at my dad for cheating and everything, but... I just look at my mom and I want to scream, "Wake up. What's wrong with you?" I mean... obviously, I'm, you know, grateful for having a mom. It's fine. Girls hate their moms. You don't have to break some age-old tradition just because mine's dead. Hey. Hey. Um, look, I'm... really sorry about what happened earlier. You must really miss her. Some days it's all I think about. Like I'm just living in the memories. Do you have a photo of her? Yeah. Oh, God, Elodie. She's beautiful. How'd she pass? Um, a car accident. We were hit by a drunk driver. A repeat offender. I had no idea. He walked away without a scratch. It doesn't make... any sense. It's... not fair. Now I have to... give my account of what happened at trial. And I just... I can't relive it. I'm so sorry. You don't have to be sorry. I haven't driven since the accident. Even though I wasn't... behind the wheel when it happened. Driving the other day... really freaked me out. Just brought back... all these memories. I'm sorry that I put you in that situation. You couldn't have known. Can I drive you home? I got in trouble at school today. So I have to have my dad sign this slip. Home is the last place I want to be. So... let's go somewhere else. Yeah. You've reached Doug Davis, leave a message. Hey, Dad. Uh, I'm going to go study at Rachelle's tonight. I'll be back later. Bye. Rachelle? - I panicked. - Ugh. What was I supposed to say? I don't know anyone else. [music playing] - You want something? - I'm good. You a fan? Uh, huge... - fan. - Is that so? How could I not be? How many times have you seen us play live? I haven't... yet. I'm really offended. I promise to make it a habit. [chuckles] Good, 'cause I really need a groupie. I'm sure you have a million. You can never have too many. What are my duties as groupie? - Just so I know. - Oh, it's easy. You just go everywhere I go, and do everything I say to do. You can even make it to head groupie if you play your cards right. I think I can manage that. Cool. I hope you think of me when you wear the pin. - Oh... I wasn't going to take it. - It's not stealing if I give it to you. Sabine, you're up. Oh. You guys know each other? Infinitely. We're roommates. So, I'll see you around? Yeah. [Shawn] Noah. Oh, from Paula's Pies. He's cute. I needed him and he wasn't there. Are all guys just the worst? No need to globalize. For real... I mean, look at Dad. Aren't you, like... so mad at him? It's not black and white, Moe. He's not a bad guy. He just made some poor choices. I'll admit, it has not been easy raising you and your brother alone for the past few years, but... I wouldn't change it for the world. Ugh. You're so corny. I hate it... also... I love you. [Luca] Twice in one day? Hey. It was nice to hear your share. Thanks. I've just been going through some stuff. My boyfriend and I broke up. Sorry to hear that. Are you? - Not really. - [laughs] How're you holding up? I thought that I'd feel better, but... I just can't shake the feeling of it. I just wish I can start over. I get wanting to start over. The second I could leave home... I did. I thought coming to Portland would make everything better, but... figuring out who I am is harder than I thought. - I gotta... - Yeah. - I've been a distraction. - No, it's... good to talk. [woman] All right. Welcome back to the stage Portland's own, the one, the only... Sabine! How you feeling, Portland? [cheering] It's great to be home.
