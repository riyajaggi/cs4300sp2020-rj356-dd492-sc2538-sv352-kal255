 [soft music playing] - ["Oom Sha La La" playing] - ♪ The milk is sour ♪ ♪ I've barely been to college... ♪ [Elodie] Last week, I heard the story on the news about a stolen sculpture worth 60 million dollars. The thief buried it in the middle of the forest. But... after 40 years, he couldn't take it anymore. He called the cops and turned himself in. He led them to the woods and watched as they dug it up. He said he felt proud when they finally pulled the statue out... because he'd finally gotten to tell someone.

 He'd gotten to confess his crime and all of its glorious detail. It makes sense, right? 'Cause... stealing alone can drive you crazy. The only thing that makes any of that worthwhile is... having someone to share it with. Oh, boo, that was kinda cute. You really love us, huh? So what are your plans for tonight? Hopefully seeing Sabine. Wow. You're all happy and stuff. I know, it's gross. [laughing] What about you, guys? I don't know. Maybe go talk to that guy over there.

 [Moe] Cool. Yeah. You guys go off and do romance stuff and I'll just be here, you know... stacking chairs. How I do. [laughing] So, want to go for a walk? I do, but I've got an interview in 20 minutes. - Mm. - My friend's got this new restaurant and he thinks he can hook me up with a manager position. Really? That's so cool. Still on for tomorrow night? - Yeah. - Good. You like bowling? [chuckles] How do you know? Got friends in high places. AKA Moe. So you've been asking about me? Is 7:00 okay? Didn't know how late you can stay out. Well, I was actually thinking about telling my mom that I was staying over at a friend's. So I wouldn't have to go back home? Wow. Yes, I love that plan. I got to go meet this guy. Wish me luck? Good luck. Hey, Mom, uh... can I talk to you about something? Uh-oh. You're not gonna like it. Okay. As long as it has nothing to do with you being pregnant, I'm good. Dad called. What did he have to say? He's out. Wow, okay. I was not expecting that. - Mm-hm. - Um... What does he want? He wants to see me. - Really? - Yeah. Why, you don't... - you don't think I should see him? - I didn't say that. I'm just trying to think of the... right thing to do here for you. [inhales] Just because he is not in my life anymore, does not mean that he can't be in yours. He hasn't made it easy. No, he hasn't. [exhales] You know how I feel about him... but he has some good qualities. Like what? He's... funny and charming. I mean, you get it from him. [chuckles] But he is also a wild card. I wish I had an answer for you. I'm sorry. For what? You didn't go to jail. You're a queen. Okay. Let's let this marinate. [man] Yeah, I mean, that's good. Hey. We'll save you some if you want to eat later. - It's really nice having you sit with us. - Mm-hm. I mean, not that I mind when you eat in your room or... Yeah, I thought I'd try a table for a change. How was your day? Not terrible. We were doing peaks and valleys. My peak was when Mrs. Liebman fed Lumpy a rat. He ate it whole. You could see it moving all the way down its body. Lumpy is the class boa constrictor. Your turn, Elodie. You don't have to. No, it's okay. Um... My valley was a pop quiz in history. And my peak is... definitely this curry. It's really good. Thanks. What's on the docket for you homework-wise today? I finished most of it during a free period. I was actually hoping maybe I could hang out with a friend later if that's okay. Okay. Sure. I won't be out late. I know you don't miss my pie that much. You know he's not here tonight. Thanks, but I'm meeting someone else. For the record, I'm team Noah. Relax, Paula. [laughs] - I'm actually meeting my dad. - Oh. Can I get you anything? I'm good.

What? Yeah, with Mitski. My manager got us a gig filling in for the opener. We got the call last night. Holy shit, that's awesome. Yeah. Two months. We start in California and then down through the Southwest, over to Nashville, then New York and then... who knows? That's... great. You should come with me. [laughs] I wish. Come on, you could show me around New Mexico. Right? Why not? I don't know. School? My dad. What about the groupie code? You're supposed to go wherever I go, do whatever I say to do. Think about it.

Please do not... make a mess in this kitchen, because we're going to have 50 people in this house tonight. What? Stanford event. Why would we be throwing a party for Dad's alma mater if he doesn't even live here? Because it was planned months ago. Your dad and I talked last night. About what? [sighs] Tabitha... there's so much you don't understand. Well, I understand that he cheated on you. Just because there's been bad, doesn't mean it hasn't been good, too. So what happened to "we deserve better"? Are we just supposed to forgive and forget? This isn't like you and Brady. Your father and I have been married for 18 years and you don't walk away from something like that. Look, I... I got to go. Can you be back here by 6:00? I told Kayla I'd stay over at hers. Well, tell Kayla you'll stay at her place another night. [school bell ringing] [sighs] We need to talk. No, we don't. I realized... it was you, wasn't it? Brady, I don't know what you're talking about, but I have to finish this before the next period. I have this thought in my head that I just can't shake. My car. You did it. Honestly, Brady... seek help. You think I don't know you, but I do. Okay, you've changed. Like, that tattoo. It's that fucking guy, isn't it? Come on, it's slutty to already have a new boyfriend, don't you think? - Fuck off, Brady. You have nothing on me. - Really? 'Cause there is only one person who knows the combination to my gym locker. So? And only my key was taken. Not my wallet or anything else. And then when they found my car... your watch was missing from the glove compartment, but... everything else was still there. Yeah, your conspiracy theory seems a little FOX-news-ish to me. - Tell me I'm wrong. - Okay. You're wrong. You think I did all of that? Well, I don't think you're smart enough to pull it off all by yourself. But trust me, I'm going to find out who helped you. As far as I see it, you have two options. I can tell my parents and the cops that I suspect you did this... or I can make this all go away. Um, what the fuck? So, what time should I come over for that Stanford thing tonight? It starts at 6:00. Cool, cool. - Should I wear a tie? - I really don't care. I am so confused. I feel like I'm living in a goddamn Twilight Zone. First my dad, and now this shit. What happened with your dad? He called me saying he was out and wanted to see me and... I fell for it and he stood me up. Why is everyone garbage? I just can't believe she would actually get back with him. She wouldn't. Dude, why are you playing all nice with Brady? He knows... about the car. He knows that I did it, and he knows I didn't do it alone. But... he said he wouldn't say anything... if I got back together with him. That is sick. He can't do that. You can't do that. No, we all can't go down for something that Brady did to me. No. No, we got you. Look, we're in this together. She's right. There has to be another way. I can't think of anything. So I'm just doing what I can. ["Nice Girl" playing] ♪ I'll hug the world Suffocate it with a pillow ♪ ♪ Pat 'em on the head Make a boy feel little ♪ ♪ Snuck out the side door Sly on my tiptoe ♪ That bastard! - What? - Brian. He ended it. Oh. Why? He got a new study partner in AP Spanish, and I know there's something going on between them. [sighs] I'll never love again. You'll definitely love again. What about that guy in pre-calc? Who, Patrick? - Hey, what's up, bro? Okay. - See you at the game? Um... Sorry, I got to go, Rachelle. Brady. Yeah? Who are you? It was me. I stole your car. Yeah, right. Did Tabitha put you up to this? - No, she had nothing to do with it. - Then what? Are you one of those girls who's obsessed with her, you'll do whatever she says? - I can prove that. - Get your hand off me. You gonna prove it, huh? How? [school bell ringing] - Dude, thought you said you were over her. - She's good in bed, you know what I mean? [laughing] Yo, Brady. Fuck you, dude. Oh, shit. Ow. What the fuck? You know what you did, you piece of shit. What's with the matching tattoo? You guys are fucking witches or something? - What's going on over here? - She assaulted me. Are you okay? No, not really. Moe, you've gotta come with me. - Dude, you good? - What happened, bro? I don't know. Moe, Moe, Moe, Moe, Moe. - What happened? - I just got suspended, - that's what happened. - What? - What did you do? - This is such bullshit. - This can really fuck things up for me. - Moe. What happened? I punched Brady. What? I know he's your friend, but you have to believe me. Brady is a bad guy. A bad guy? How? He hurts Tabitha. What do you mean? I've seen the bruises. What a piece of shit. - Yeah. - So that's why you punched him. - Yeah. I had to do something. - I get it. I get it. Let's get out of here. I'm sorry. For what? - Elodie. - Dad, I can explain. No more lies. - It's not as bad as it looks. - No, it's worse. How do you explain this? You stole that car? I... Look at all this stuff. You have a real problem. I love you, but you need help. I want to try and stop. I just... You have an addiction. And clearly, whatever we've tried isn't working. There is a treatment facility in Seattle - and they've got Inpatient care... - Dad, no. I... I'll be grounded. I'll go to therapy. I'll do whatever you want. Jenna is making the arrangements. We're doing what's best for you. Best for everyone. Pack a bag... whatever you'll need for a few weeks. I'll give you some time. Give me the phone. - I... - Elodie! [sighs] [knocking at door] Hey, what up, Elodie's dad? [knocking at window] Are you crazy? What are you doing? What? You don't carry a ladder with you wherever you go? Come on. Uh, one sec. So, yeah. Elodie just left this in the library when we were studying earlier. So, just... Elodie takes chemistry? Oh, yeah, you know. Like... in her spare time. Elodie isn't actually going to be at school for a little while, but I'll give it to her. Oh, yeah, okay. Actually, could you just grab me a piece of paper? I just want to leave her a note. - Sure, just one second. - Thanks. Actually, you know what? It's cool. I'm just gonna send her a text. - Did everything go okay? - Yeah. Except now your dad has my chemistry book. Didn't really think that through. [car engine starting] You sure you want to do this? I've never felt more sure. Something about all this, feels a little faded. The universe is telling me to go. Shit. Hey, ladies. I guess that's me. I love you, guys. I love you. Thanks for saving me. You saved me. We're really gonna miss you. Hey, you better keep her safe for us. Are you kidding me? She's keeping me safe.
