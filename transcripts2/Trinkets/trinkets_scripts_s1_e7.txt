 ["Sleep In" playing] ♪ Don't forget that It's a feeling ♪ ♪ You know that anyway... ♪ Where's Sabine's place again? - I think it's in the Alberta district. - Wow. You're like a local now. [laughing] Yeah, I got us invited to this party, didn't I? Yeah, you did. Which is still mystifying to me. What can I say? I've got game. Bro. [all laughing] I totally don't have game.

 I love this song. I know. You put it on the playlist for us. - I didn't think you'd listen to it. - Yeah. Well, I did. So... Luca lives here too, right? At least we'll know two people. I'm happy as long as we're not at the dance. Who are you and what have you done with Tabitha Foster? Honestly... all I want to do is not play the role of Tabitha Foster for a night. What? Did that sound basic? No, I get it. All I want to do is not think about Noah. ♪ I know if I take that chance I'll regret it ♪

 Y'all wanna Stick and Poke? Uh, no, thanks. We're good. [indistinct chatter] Is that the bassist from Future Islands? Oh, my God, you guys. I love this party. Oh, excuse me. [Tabitha] Cheers. To tonight. - [glass shatters] - [girl exclaims] [cheering] Hey, Elodie. I'm so glad you and your friends made it to the party. I'm really sorry about the glass. Stop. It's not a party until somebody breaks something. Can I steal her away for a second? [both] Yeah. Damn, she is hot. You think she has a shot? - Okay, what is happening on your phone? - Did you know they were going together? Of course they are. That corsage... gross. You know what, screw it. We're at legitimately fun party. [sighs] Yeah. Yeah, you know what? If he's moving on, so am I. Tonight, I'm going to hook up with a hot stranger. Okay. Then you're in luck, because I make an excellent wingwoman. I'm so glad you could make it. I know it was all really a last minute. No worries, I'm pretty free, like... all the time. I don't believe that. Trust me, I am very free. [laughing] I don't know why I did that. I'm an idiot. Well, you're in luck, because I have a thing for idiots. Hey, Sabine. - You guys interested? - Ooh, what are these? - Ecstasy. - Pure MDMA. Totally clean, you'll love it. - After you. - No, I'm good. It's cool. This is exactly what I need tonight. - Bless you. - It's what we all need. Oh, shit, when did Vice get here? - Vice, give me your body! - Hey. [Sabine chuckles] What's going on with you and Luca? Nothing. We kissed... once. It was so awkward. Wow. - Dude, you should go talk to him. - No, that's the last thing I need. I'm trying to avoid anything romantic. But back to you. - Should we do a lap? - Yeah. What are we talking about? Um... Just looking at some options for Moe. Yup. Just me. Well, let me know if I can be of service. Definitely. Shall we? Hey, guys. - Hey. - This is my friend, Moe. Cool, Frank. I'm Vice. So, how did you two meet? Um, like... five minutes ago. Cool. Yeah, cool... Um, us too. And now it feels like we've known each other our entire lives. Well, congrats. Um, I'm going to go grab another one. - Did it seem like I was into you? - No, it would have gotten them to stay. Does that offer still stand? I feel like I could really have a chance with her if I just got on her level. And Sabine's friend said it's totally safe. - It's 100% pure MDMA. - You don't have to convince me, okay? I got to take the edge off, and I'm gonna make something happen tonight. So, gimme. - So you've done it before? - Nope. - [both] You haven't? - Okay. Don't be shocked. Have you? Never. It can be our first time, together. How about you guys take it and I can just be the responsible one? Nuh. Either we're all in or I'm out. Please, be all in. I thought you said you didn't want to be Tabitha Foster for one night. So, shouldn't you do the opposite of what you would normally do? Okay, I did say that. [music playing] Okay. Drinking from that dirty-ass cup was the least "me" thing I've ever done. [laughing] - How long is it supposed to take? - Google it. - Are you feeling anything? - I don't know. Are you? [yawns] I think there's a marble under my butt. [laughing] Some friend of mine said you're supposed to rub soft stuff on your skin when you do Molly. Oh. [laughs] - It's nice. - Do that again. Whoa. Wow. [laughing] ["Freelance" playing] ♪ Oh, walk on the water ♪ ♪ For me ♪ ♪ Just for me, baby ♪ ♪ Okay ♪ ♪ Although there's always Gon' be pressure ♪ ♪ Okay ♪ ♪ Pressure ♪ ♪ Oh, walk on the water ♪ ♪ For me ♪ ♪ Just for me, baby... ♪ Go talk to her, go. I'm the prince here. - Let's do it. - Leave it. You can be princess. I need rhythm. [laughing] Elodie. How are you feeling? Feeling perfect. Me too. I need water. [clears throat] I'll be back. - No luck? - No. I don't even care, 'cause tonight is so great. I just wanna etch it in my brain forever. Oh, my God. You just gave me the best idea. I love it. Am I weird or does this actually feel good? You're definitely weird. Can one of you hold my hand? Needles give me anxiety. Are we going to wake up tomorrow and regret this? Dude, tomorrow does not exist. [laughing] A triangle, for the three of us. My dad's gonna kill me. You know, these days... I don't think my dad would even notice. Real talks. I don't think my dad would recognize me if he saw me on the street. I'm sorry. I don't want to be sad. Fuck sad. [laughing] Next to stealing, this is hands-down the best high I've ever felt. Hands down? As a one-time expert, definitely. I love you guys. Me too! I love love. No, I mean it. I mean, everything's just changed so much recently. Seeing my dad with that woman... It was just way too real. I can't imagine having seen it with anyone else. Would've been way worse. We got you, girl. Oh, man. You guys got me feeling all sentimental and shit. - [laughing] - [Moe] I hate you. But also, I will quite literally shout from this rooftop... I love you! - Woo! - [laughing] Like, the only people that like Modest Mouse are from Portland. - Hey. - [man] It's such a cliché. They're not even from here, they're from Washington. Don't be so dramatic, Josh. They're good. I'm from the Southwest and I love them. "Everyone's life ends, but no one ever completes it." That got me through some shit. "Opinions were like kittens, I was giving them away." The Lonesome Crowded West. Where have you been hiding this one? She's great. And she really know her shit. You have to be careful, though. She's got a little more devil in her than you might think. You think the devil gets a bad rep. [man 2] Sabine, we're out of ice. - Can I help? - No, stay. Have fun. I'll find you. You better get after that. Your face is so... interesting. You know, you're much chiller than I thought. So, do you wanna, like, kiss me? [chuckles] Do you always ask so formal like that? Yeah. Consent is where it's at. It's sexy. - So, that's a yes? - Yes. You okay? Sorry, I'm just... a little light-headed. Let me guess. One of Sabine's friends special pills. Here, come sit. Drink this, it'll help. Thank you. Of course. - [chuckles] - How are you feeling? Yeah. Better now. Good. That feels nice. That's the Molly talking. [laughs] I guess. Are you okay? It's just... I think I just have a bad habit of trusting the wrong people. Have a little more faith in yourself. [Sabine] Don't mind me. Oh, hey. You two look cozy. Yeah, she was just feeling a little sick. It's all good. Usually when people say that, it's not all good. When we said we were going to throw this party, I thought it meant that we were going to throw this party. Not that I would be doing all the work and you would be off hooking up with someone else. - Are you two together? - We're not together. It's complicated. Honestly, I don't do complicated. ["Dove" playing] I love kissing you. I don't think I can do this. Is everything okay? Yeah, everything is great. I just... - I have to go. - Okay. Well, nice making out with you. - Hey. Have you seen Sabine? - Hey. - I thought she came this way. - Yeah, uh... I just had a really awkward moment with her and Luca. - What do you mean? - I think they have something between them. Guys, we need to leave, like, five minutes ago. I feel like I'm peaking, and there's something I got to do before this warm fuzzy feeling ends. Let's go. - ["Love For Me" playing] - ♪ Disaster ♪ ♪ Pretending ♪ ♪ To hold it ♪ ♪ Together while I'm in my seat Hope you can notice... ♪ You sure about this? Yeah. ♪ I still see you in your seat ♪ ♪ I hold back my laughter ♪ ♪ I'm dying... ♪ [woman] Welcome to homecoming. Ticket, please. Oh, technically I'm not going to the dance. I just got to talk to someone real quick. Without a ticket, it's not happening. Not to mention, you don't meet the dress code requirements. What do I need to get in? A goddamn ball gown? Yes. You need to be in formal wear. Honestly, that's classist. Better believe, the local news would eat that shit up. Or they might enjoy watching you get arrested, when the police test your bloodstream for illegal substances. ♪ I wanna know if you got love for me ♪ ♪ I wanna know if you got love for me ♪ ♪ I wanna know if you got love for me ♪ ♪ You say that you miss me I wanna know if you got love for me ♪ ♪ I wanna know if you got love for me ♪ ♪ I wanna know if you got love for me ♪ ♪ I wanna know if you got love for me ♪ ♪ You say that you love me ♪ ♪ I wanna know if you got love for me ♪ - ♪ I wanna know if you got love for me ♪ - [phone line ringing] ♪ I wanna know if you got love for me ♪ ♪ You say that you miss me ♪ ♪ I wanna know if you got love for me ♪ ♪ I wanna know if you got love for me ♪ ♪ I wanna know if you got love for me ♪ ♪ If you got love Love for me ♪ ♪ If you got love Love for me ♪ ♪ If you got love Love for me ♪ Wanna dance? Come on. What' up? This is Noah. You know what to do. [beep] Noah, hey, it's Moe. Uh... But you know that... [laughs] Um... Listen, uh... I'm really sorry for how I've acted. Uh... I've had my walls up, and it's really stupid... because I think... I think I might... I don't know, man, I think I might... maybe love you. Yeah. Oh, and if you get this soon, I'm outside the gym and... and I'm on Molly. [laughs] Okay, thank you. Thank you. [laughs] Bye. Oh, my God. Oh, it feels so amazing... to tell the truth. I can't believe you just did that. [Moe] It's all so clear. Look, for so long I couldn't understand why I was going to those meetings. And now I know. It was for you guys. It was so this could happen. Even though you guys are so messed up with your shoplifting and everything, it's like, we all have our own shit, you know? And, like, this, the three of us... we're just meant to be. But why do you say it like that? Our shoplifting? How are we more messed up than you? No, I just mean, like... Like this one... has like a stash of shit under her bed. And you, with your, like, 200 lipsticks. Wait. So I'm confused. You're better than us because you don't steal as much? Guys, I have to tell you something. I don't steal... - at all. - Wait, what? So you've just been lying this whole time? Just sitting in the meetings, silently judging us? No. No. I mean, yeah, at first. - And then... - Okay. That's pathetic. And mean. Look, guys, I'm sorry I lied to you, I just... I thought you out of all people would understand. So, who do you think you are? You think you're less fucked up than we are? No, shit. I didn't mean it to sound like that. I don't care how you meant it. I'm sorry. Wait up.
