 - It's Elodie. - Rachelle. Our dads work together. I heard about your mom. That is so tragic. Are you okay? Wait. Is that a weird question to ask? Of course you're not okay. It's fine. I'm... fine. You probably haven't heard, but there's this back-to-school blowout tonight. Want to come? I'm not really into the whole party thing. And how's that working for you? - Are we even invited? - It's a house party. You don't get invited. You either go or don't go. Okay. Yeah, sure. I'll pick you up at eight. And maybe go with the less grandfatherly vibe. - You're ridiculous. - What?

 - I never get a good picture of my ass. - Oh, my heart breaks. So, what's our timing for Ravi's tonight? Ah, you tell me. I heard he's bringing back the ice luge. Oh, please, do not throw up again. Can I help you? Oh. Sorry, I was just... Oh, my God, it's Kendall and Kylie. Not the friendliest, are they? Drink, drink, drink! Drink, drink, drink, drink! Way better than Albuquerque, am I right? What's their deal? Who? Tabitha and Brady? He's a senior and she's so pretty she's basically an avatar. It's like they knew they were the two hottest people in school and decided, "Why not be cliché?" Noah, you're doing it all wrong. It's all in the flick of the wrist. That's so myth. It's actually all in the tip... ...of your finger. Speaking of the genetically blessed, it is not right how hot Noah Simos is. Totally. - Hi. - Hi. Alas, my odds are better with Brian from Honors Chem. I'm gonna go dazzle him with my wit. Try not to stand around looking all... murdery. Whatevs. Look, why'd you even bother coming if you're gonna be such a bitch? You're offensive. - What? Come on. Let's go back inside. - Brady, I want to go. You need to lighten up. All right? You used to be more fun. - You used to be less of a dick. - Hey. Can you stop, Brady? You're hurting me. Brady, let go! Fine. Be that way. Shit! Perfect. Bro. We were down by so much in the half, and then you came back and you crushed it. Bro, it was like David and Goliath. - That goalie was a beast. A literal beast. - Right? Hey. - How you doing? - Hi. So... you got a little something right there. - Oh. - Hold on, let me get it. Hold on. Yeah. I won't tell anybody if you don't. All right? Thanks. All right. I'm gonna catch you around. Peace. - Wanna get out of here? - What about your friend? New girl? Honestly, I just brought her 'cause my dad asked me to be nice to her. Let's go. - No, I'm not stressed about it. - They're okay, I guess. ♪ Open up your eyes Then you'll realize ♪ ♪ Here I stand With my everlasting love ♪ ♪ Need you by my side Girl, to be my bride ♪ ♪ You'll never be denied Everlasting love ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah... ♪ Gonna need you to put that down.

Hey. We're here. Do I seriously have to do this? I told you, it was just a misunderstanding. Come on, El. The security guard caught you red-handed. You're lucky they didn't press charges. That's me, super lucky. Well, I thought what happened back in Albuquerque was a one-time thing. My friend Suzanne says these kind of things have helped some of her patients. Jenna is right. You never know, it could be good for you. Whatever. You're gonna miss my science fair. Seems like your parents have other plans for me. Look, if you want, I... I could come back and leave early, pick you up. It's fine. I'll take the MAX. We'll see you back home. "God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference." Good afternoon, everyone. I'm Shawn... Hi, Shawn. ...and I'm a kleptomaniac. I'm four years shoplifting-free. I'm also a codependent and the child of an alcoholic. And I've learned not to be defined by labels. So, who would like to share today? Great. Hi, I'm Stella. Hi, Stella. It's been six months since I've lifted anything... and it's not like I haven't been tempted. I mean, there's a Petco on my corner. I just keep telling myself, if I stick with the program, I'll stay clean. Hi, I'm Claire. Hi, Claire. Since that incident at work, I've... started taking stuff from the office. Uh, staplers, pens. I know I need to stop. But... it's like there's this hole that I keep trying to fill with all of these office supplies... and it's, like, never enough, you know? Thank you. Hello there. We've got a lot of new faces today. Please... feel welcome to share if you're so inspired. Any of the other newcomers? What about you in the back? Me? Mm-hmm. I... don't really feel like sharing, if that's okay. Of course. But your shares are a valuable part of our collective journey. I promise you, this is an incredibly safe space. I don't really know what to say. Why don't you tell us your name? Hi, I'm Elodie. Hi, Elodie. Do you want to tell us about the first time you stole? Okay. Um... it was a couple months ago. It was kind of an accident. I... walked out of a hospital cafeteria with a pack of Starbursts I forgot to pay for. Once I realized, I knew I should have gone back, but... I kind of felt like I deserved it. It's like... there are forces that can randomly take people away. There should be... forces that randomly give you things for free. We are incredibly grateful for that share. Is that a Courtney Barnett pin? - I love her music. - Yeah. She did an after-party at this club where I work. She was chill. Did she play "Avant Gardener"? Yeah, people went nuts. You like long walks on the beach? I like long walks on the beach. - Moe, why are you always giving me shit? - With a face like that? Someone's got to. She can't help herself. You guys know each other? - No. - We go to the same school. Right on. Luca. Elodie. And you are? Tabitha. Tabitha. I know your type. Is that so? Let me guess. Some judge cut you a sweet deal. Shall we reconvene? Drool much? Just so we're clear, this never happened. Shocker. - Oh, hey. I was just... - Sure. - So, where are you from? - New Mexico. Ah. The land of meth heads and UFOs. I hope you said goodbye to the sun. Forever. - That bad? - Yeah. And the people here suck, too. Everyone's obsessed with keeping Portland weird. It's oppressive. - Life is oppressive. - That why you steal? I just... need some concealer. Oh, hey. You better keep an eye on that one. Guess old habits die hard. Look, I only showed up today because my dad's lawyer convinced some judge that going there once a week would be my salvation. From what? Your unlimited allowance? Mommy's Pinterest palace? The holistic family chef? - Is he mean to you? - I'm not doing this with you. Fine. Just tell me what they got you for. Bracelet. Got a little cocky. A hidden camera. So what's your deal? I... don't really feel comfortable talking about this here. Fuck talking. Let's see who can get the best shit in the shortest amount of time. Winner takes all. And how do we account for taste? Highest price tag wins. Fine. Cool.

Look, I get that those may have been your glory days, but you can spare me the trip down memory lane. Whatever you say, Tabby. Not bad. Your turn. - What the hell is this? - Spanx. Were you even trying? Yo, you're late and empty-handed. Holy shit. Yeah, right. Those are not real. No, but they were $400. And the winner is... Well, I really don't think it's your style. Don't be a garbage human. We made a deal. Give her the jacket. No, she's right. It's not really me. Moe, have you been kidnapped? Yes. Send for help! They're such losers. Hey, Brady. Look, I'm stranded. Can you come and pick me up? Thanks. I'm dropping a pin. Can you quit stalking me? Sorry. It's just... what happened with you and Brady at the party... You don't know what you're talking about. I just mean if you... ever need someone to talk to... Unlike you, I have friends, so I'm good. Hey, babe. You look nice. I got your favorite. Extra foam. Thanks. I know you said you weren't hungry. - Ever hear of knocking? - Oh, sorry. I just brought you a sprout bowl. Thanks. Uh, look. I hope I wasn't too hard on you about this whole shoplifting thing. I mean, God knows, I pulled some stupid stunts at your age and I hadn't gone through anything close to what you have. It's okay, Dad. We don't have to talk about it. Don't worry, I will get this elliptical out of here. I'm thinking of turning the garage into a home gym. Since when are you into exercise? Jenna got me into it. Feel like a new man. You know... I'm really glad you're here. You can finally get to know Jenna and Spencer better. I don't not know them. Oh, I mean, more than Christmas every other year. Obviously, I wish it were... under different circumstances... I've got homework. So... Okay, kiddo. Good night. You said you'd never be back. What up, Paula? You know, same ol'. - Usual? - Best blueberry pie in town. Employee discount still apply? Real reunion in here tonight. Hey, yo, Paula, I'll be right back. - Yes, yes! - There's no way! You sure about this? The boys are right outside. How long before they miss you? I don't know. Two, three minutes.

The first rule of shoplifting is to be invisible in plain sight. But... aren't we kind of doing that all the time? It's like we filter our lives to fit into other people's ideas of who we're supposed to be. Who we're supposed to date. Or how we're supposed to deal with heartbreak. But... what if you meet people who... without even trying, just... see you? What if the people you least expect could turn out to be... your people... if you let them? ♪ I don't want to be the measure ♪
