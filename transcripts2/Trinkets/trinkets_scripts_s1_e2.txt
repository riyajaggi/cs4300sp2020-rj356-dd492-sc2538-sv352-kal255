 What does your mom think? She's totally pumped. Yeah, I just don't want to go all in before it's official. - Um... - With your grades and my recommendation, you've got a real chance. Just work on your attendance. I'll make sure your transcripts get sent in. Thanks, man. What did Dunford nail you for this time? You know, same shit as always. Got it out for me. [boy] We're gonna go make a bong out of a Nalgene. You in? Let me catch up with you guys later. [boy] It went right to her. Right. God, stop. I'm serious. Don't kiss me. Why? Because we're in a goddamn aquarium, and people can see us. - Would that be so bad? - Yes. Don't be stupid. That's why you like me.

Well, I know it sucks to miss your best friend's party, but Jenna and I have a wedding this weekend. It's too last minute You don't even have to come. I can stay with people. I just need a plane ticket. It's like $300. I can pay you back. I don't like the idea of you going back there all alone, okay? Not this soon. Dad, seriously. I don't have anybody here. I miss my friends. How about I take you next month? - But the party is this weekend. - There will be other parties. Zoey will understand. I'm sorry, kiddo.

Rip City, baby. I'm not really into basketball. Come on. Spencer's got his own jerseys and everything. He might even let you borrow one. [keyboard clacking] I haven't lifted anything in weeks. Feels good. [laughs] Got a new job. Working at this club over on Ash. You know, first week there I... took a few bottles of booze. No big deal. But then, the owner started buying tacos every night as family meal for the staff. So... that made me feel shitty. So I stopped. [phone vibrates] [Shawn] Thank you for that share, Luca. [footsteps] [Shawn] Do we have any birthdays today? [Luca] It's kind of like tribal electro-pop. Her song "Warpaint" is amazing. Yeah, Frankie Simone. Thanks, dude. You won't regret it. All... All right. Sick. I love Frankie Simone. She's so good. - You know her? - So good. What are we talking about? This band tonight at Paper Tiger. You guys should come. Tonight, I don't know. Yeah... No. What about... Tabitha? Yeah, being forced to come here is enough for me. Yeah, don't really think it's your scene. You don't know anything about me. And yet he's not wrong. What's that supposed to mean? I, on the other hand, have plans. So... Cool. Well, if you come by, just... drop my name at the door. Cool. I will. You are so yourself. Hm. ["Cellar Door" playing] ♪ If this is the reality ♪ ♪ I'm living in a fantasy ♪ Dad, you're home. - Hey. How was school? - [camera clicks] Ugh, school-ish.

[scoffs] And what's your brand exactly? I am all for you being a social influencer... but... when you call me to dinner, can it be after you've taken your photos? - I'm starving here. - Okay, okay! I'm almost done. [shutter clicks continue] See? I'm done. Is that what you're wearing tonight? [knock at door] I-I think Brady's here. - Hey, Brady. - Hey, finally I'm not outnumbered. Come on. Sit.

[Spencer] Go, Blazers! [door closes] ["That Kind of Girl" playing] ♪ And I know that I am always Fucking up your world ♪ [music continues muffled] - Put that away. - You scared me. Yeah, well, good. Are they checking IDs? Only if you're drinking. But they might not let you in if they know you're from a red state. - New Mexico's not a red state. - Redder than here. I should probably just go. I have to be home by 11. Nut up, lady. We're with Luca. Oh, hey. Hello. Good evening... ma'am. - [boy] Oh! - [Brady] Dude, you're so eliminated. I got this! Got... this. - Yes. - [laughter] Did you see that double combo? Savage. [chuckles] I got this. How much longer do you think you want to hang out? What? We can't go yet. You're up next.

So, what kind of terrible night brought you here? It's honestly not that interesting. I'm interested. - Hey, can I get that IPA that's on tap? - Hey. - You okay? - Yeah. No. It's fine. Nice watch. It's my grandpa's. Tell me about him. [scoffs] You want to talk about my grandpa? Why not? Well, he was great. He was an artist. Well, he was a carpenter, but he always wanted to be an artist. When I was little, we used to go to the park and sketch together. It's stupid. I don't think so. [man] Luca! Shit, I gotta go back to work. To be continued? [crowd cheering] [woman] This song's called "Just Lie Down." [rock song starts] So, I thought you said you weren't coming. Changed my mind. What's your excuse? Glossier having a pop-up sale in the back? Nice jacket. You got a drink without a wristband? Swiped it from some guy. You steal from people, too? Only assholes. [phone chimes] I gotta go to the bathroom. - Hey, don't you have a boyfriend? - Why do you care? I saw you throwing yourself at Luca. Albuquerque's obviously into him. Since when? Maybe if you paid attention to someone other than yourself, you'd know. It's sick. I love it. So, how do you want to do this? Cash or Venmo? I'm just gonna try it on in the mirror real quick. Hey. Um, I have a boyfriend. Okay. [scoffs] Wait, you owe me! Owe you what? Get off! - Leaving so soon? - Not soon enough. - What the hell? - She took my jacket. Yo! Wait! Hey! [Moe] Yo! [Elodie] Hey! - Screw you! - Hey! What the... [tires screeching] Yo! What just happened? Who was the girl? That was insane. I was trying to sell my jacket and I let her try it on and she took off. I'm so stupid. Fucking Gwen. Okay, rookie move. Never trust someone named Gwen. Wait, were you selling her the jacket that I gave you? Rude. She stole the jacket that you stole? - Meta. - Why were you selling that jacket anyway? I needed the money for a plane ticket home. Why are you going home? For... a girl. So... she's your girlfriend? Zoey? Yeah. She's my girlfriend. Long-distance must suck. It's her birthday this weekend. I wanted to fly home to surprise her. Forget it, it's stupid. It's not stupid. I just... I feel so alone here. Who doesn't? Is that supposed to make her feel better? - I'm just being honest. - Well, honestly... you're kinda the worst at making people feel better. - That's kinda true. - Hey. [crowd in bar cheering] Plus, you know... you're not alone. [woman in bag] Hi, everyone, I'm Frankie Simone. I'm so excited to be here tonight. Hey. There's something that should make you feel better. Zoey loves her. Well... she's not here. ♪ Colors all over me ♪ ♪ So when we went to war ♪ [crowd cheering] ♪ I saw your colors all over me ♪ ♪ So when we went to war ♪ ♪ I saw your colors all over me ♪ ♪ So when we went to war ♪ ♪ Aye-aye-aye ♪ ♪ I saw your colors all over me ♪ [crowd cheering] [Frankie] Thank you all so much, we had a great night. Love you, Portland. How good is she? [phone chimes] Um, I got to go. Blazers game. Shit. Me, too. Well... See you around? Yeah. There you are. [Doug] Where have you been? Are you okay? Sorry, I went for a walk. I texted you. [Doug] That was hours ago. I left you a million messages. We were worried. My phone died. [Jenna] We're glad you're okay. But I think we need to talk about some ground rules. Maybe a curfew. My mom never gave me a curfew. [Jenna sighs] I'm tired. I'm going to bed. [chuckles] You scared me. I mean, you knew I was coming. And you left the door unlocked, so that seems like a "you" problem. Can't lie. Your mom getting stuck with the night shift... is really working out in my favor. Yeah. God bless the sick children. Casual reading. Yeah. Kuhn's theories created a total paradigm shift. The dude is a genius. You're a genius. [chuckles] Yeah, well, at least you're hot. For the record, I take offense to being objectified. Yeah, you seem super offended. - Hm. So we're clear... - Mm. I know. I'm your dirty little secret. ["Coming Down" playing] ♪ I take as much ♪ ♪ As I can get ♪ ♪ I don't take ♪ ♪ Any regret ♪ ♪ I close my eyes ♪ ♪ To conjure up something ♪ ♪ But it's just a faint ♪ ♪ Taste in my mouth ♪ [phone chimes] [chuckles] [scoffs] Where'd you disappear to? You're my good luck charm. I got annihilated after you left. I just didn't feel like being there anymore. [scoffs] So what have you been up to? I called you, like, 50 times. I wanted to see you. I was just at the house. I took a bath. You smell good. [phone chiming] - Who are you texting? - No one. [chuckles] [phone chimes] Well, if it's no one, then just let me see. Come on, Brady. I hate when you get like this. Well, then don't be shady. I'm not. I'm just... Can you stop? Brady! Happy now? [door slams shut] [theme music playing]
