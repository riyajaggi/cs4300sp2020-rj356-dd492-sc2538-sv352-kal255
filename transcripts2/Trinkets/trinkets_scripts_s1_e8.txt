 Thanks for offering. Have you talked to her? - No. - Me neither. I thought about sending her a text. - Really? - Everyone, please take your seats. The exam is about to begin. Good luck. There she is. Don't you have school? - I'm sort of over school. - Mm-hm. What are you listening to? Is that the Spinanes? Deep cut. I'm impressed. What can I get you?

 I'll have a cortado and whatever she wants. I'll have the same. Thanks. So, did you have fun the other night at the party? I did. Although it went a bit downhill after. Yeah. Me and Luca kind of had it out too. So, are you guys dating or... I don't really like those terms, you know? Boyfriend, girlfriend. Who cares? - So, how did you meet? - At a show a couple years ago. He had a crush on me and I didn't want to break his heart. Especially when it had already been broken a bunch of times before. Yeah, he alluded to some of that at the meetings. Hold up, you go to Shoplifters? He didn't tell you that's how we met? Shit. The whole... anonymous thing. I mean, I knew he had a bunch of court-ordered meetings back in the day, but I didn't know he was still going. Well, don't say anything. I can keep a secret. Sabine? Thank you. So, tell me more things. Do you miss home? I miss the sun on my skin. Cold here all the time. And I miss actually seeing the stars. I get it. I moved around a lot too. Ten times by the time I was 15. That's brutal. I don't think I could handle doing this nine more times. Really? 'Cause I get the sense you're a lot stronger than you think. You do? I know what it's like... to feel like you're going the wrong way on a one-way street. But it won't always be like this. The whole world is going to open up for you. You'll see. Okay. Oh, sorry. I should probably get going. I have an appointment over in Nob Hill. - I have an errand that way. I'll take you. - Okay. ♪ I wiped away the pain... ♪ Let's go in here for a sec. - I can't, I'm gonna be late. - Come on. Aren't I worth it? Didn't know you wore glasses. Only sunglasses. In Portland? There is no sun. I'm preparing myself for the spotlight. I'm here if you have any questions. What do you think? They look great on you. You should take them. - Uh... - Come on. You can't steal from the store this small. - I dare you. - No, really. There are cameras everywhere. Are you good at this or not? Come on, Elodie. I want to see you blow my mind. You're kinda wild, you know that. I have to go. But I don't want to. So don't. But I'm so, so late. Okay, fine. I'll let you go. - When am I going to see you next? - Anytime. Literally, anytime. Friday. Okay. Thanks for the glasses. Where have you been? I've been texting you. I got the train schedule messed up and... And who the hell was that? A friend. Is that okay with you? Elodie, I know it's hard to think about the accident, but this is important, and you're blowing it off for some girl? You think I don't think about it? It's all I think about. Today was the first day in forever that I haven't thought about it. I'm sorry, but you have to do this and now the lawyers have to reschedule. I just... I don't know what's gotten into you. You need to start being more responsible. - You're grounded. - You can't do that. I just did. Just a second, Spencer. Hi, can I help you? Elodie is grounded right now. She can't see you. Everyone, please take your seats. The exam is about to begin. ♪ I faked it every time But that's all right ♪ ♪ I can hardly feel anything I hardly feel anything at all ♪ ♪ You gave me fifteen hundred ♪ ♪ To see your hypnotherapist ♪ ♪ I only went one time, you let it slide ♪ ♪ Fell on hard times a year ago Was hoping you'd let it go and you did ♪ ♪ I have emotional motion sickness ♪ ♪ Somebody roll the windows down... ♪ Moe. - Hello, Mr. Dunford. What's up? - I have great news. Today is a day you're gonna retire that sweater vest? Better. Someone's headed to Korea. You got into the STEM program. Oh, my God. - I got in? - I knew you would. I'm so proud of you. - I expected a little more excitement. - Oh, yeah. No, uh... I'm pumped. I bet your mom's going to be over the moon. Have fun celebrating, but not too much fun. Thanks. Ah! My arm. We gotta get you to a doctor. It could be a break. It can't be broken. I've got soccer playoffs coming up. Okay. Don't worry. You'll be fine, okay? - You good? - Yeah. Hey. - Thanks. - No problem. They're going to hook you up. I'm so screwed if it's broken. It's going to be okay. No, you don't get it. I can't be benched. This is the year that decides what college I go to. I need the scholarship. Don't put so much pressure on yourself. - We're not all smart like you. - I'm not that smart. Don't do that. I mean... That voicemail... was not smart. It's cool, I get it. You were fucked up. You didn't mean it. No, that's not it. I... I meant every word of it. You did? You know, you really hit the ball on that one. Yeah, well, I was coming to tell you, and then you fell on your ass, so. - Yeah? - Yeah. You know it's your fault, right? 'Cause I was trying to impress you. You impress me. So, did you... have the time of your life at the dance? It was bad music. Stale potato chips. It was pretty standard. Noah, I'll be honest, I was... surprised that you... actually went with Kayla. - Moe, what happened? - Hi, Mom. Um, this is... Noah. Mrs. Truax. Oh, Noah. You heard of me? - Yes, I've heard of you. - Mom. Okay. Let's get you to X-ray. Come on. Yeah. Three weeks isn't bad. Hey, you're lucky it's just a sprain. Soccer is my ticket. My parents... they want me to go to college so bad. You will. Just... just try to clear your head. I don't think I can be as chill as you. Oh, yeah. That's me. Real Zen. About the other day at school when I flipped out on you. I heard from my dad. - Oh, shit. - Yeah, he's getting released soon, and I just... just... It really messed with me, and I'm sorry. I shouldn't have taken it out on you. You wanna talk about it? I don't even know what I would say. I mean, there's this guy out there who's my dad and... even though he's a complete stranger, he still managed to totally fuck me up. Parents always manage to do that, you know? Thanks for telling me. Thank you. ♪ Care for me 'Cuz I'm thinking 'bout leavin' ♪ ♪ Gotchu baby do you got me... ♪ Kissing me like you're afraid to hurt me. I don't wanna break you any more than you already are. What? What's this? It's new. - I like it. - Yeah? I did some wild things on Molly. ♪ I'm lonely, babe When you don't read my mind ♪ ♪ I want you to feel blue And if you ask maybe I'll come on back ♪ I need to tell you something. Well... that's never good. I loved your message. You don't know how much that meant to me. Uh-huh. But I didn't hear it the night that you left it. So? I didn't hear it... because I was with Kayla. We hooked up the night of the dance. I'm so sorry. It didn't mean anything, it was stupid. So stupid, I'm so sorry. - Why would you tell me that? - Because... How could we move on, huh? If I didn't tell you the truth? How? I want to be honest. Okay? I like you so much. I do, and I don't want to hurt you ever. How much could you possibly like me, if the second we get into a fight you fuck around with someone else? - I'm trying to be honest. - You know what, Noah? We should be honest, okay. I didn't tell you, but I got into a semester abroad. It's a STEM program in Korea, and I'm going to go. So we should probably just end this now. So, that's it, right? - Yeah. - That's it? Yup. You can't keep pushing everyone away. Hey. Hey, uh, can we talk? - Come on, seriously? - I seriously have nothing to say to you. - But I have a crazy story for you... - I have the PSATs. - Hey. - Hey. - What are you up to? - Just a project for my art class. - Into photography? - Yeah, I am. So, what's the project? Well, I want to tell the story of a day in photos. That's cool. What have you got so far? Mm, just a few abstract ideas, but... I realized I kind of need a subject. - You available? - Only if you get my good angles. Maybe we should try your right side. Is the left one bad? Actually... No. They're both pretty good. So... will you be my subject? I would, but I'm moving to this new place, so... I need to get some stuff. You're moving out of Sabine's? Well, after the party, it didn't seem right. You two sound like you have some history. We do. It's been over for a while. I want you to know that. Appreciate it. What if we multitask? Maybe I'll go shopping and you can document it? One man's errands is another's inspiration? - Something like that. - Okay, but hold up. When you say shopping... - do you mean... - Actually purchasing items? Right. Let's do it. What exactly happened with you and Sabine? So, when I first got to Portland, I... kinda got wrapped up in her for a bit. You know... - She has this way about her. - Oh yeah, I noticed. Yeah, but Sabine never wants to be with anyone for too long or... stay anywhere for too long. It's that rock-n-roll lifestyle. Exactly. So, was it serious? Uh, I need a break. As long as you know that this sofa is not coming with us. Yeah, it was serious for a little. But I think what Sabine wants more than a relationship is an audience. - Sounds intense. - Yeah. Everything with her was always... so consuming that I... kind of lost myself. It got really toxic. And after a while, I just couldn't play by her rules. If you guys were over, then why'd she get so angry at the party? I don't know. Probably because it wasn't on her terms. I've had so much chaos surround me my whole life... Kinda want to be still for a minute. That sounds nice. Alright, let's take this rug home. Sneaky. - My turn. - Hey, no, no. - Come on. - That's not how this works. Come on. One picture. Okay. Stop... Okay. It needs work, but... it's home now. Luca, it's great because it's yours. I love it. Oh. But your fengshui is off. - Is it? - Mm-hm. - We gotta move the bed. - If you say so. Let's move it right there, across from the door. Okay. Cool. That's better. Um... I don't know if I'm ready. Everything just seems a little bit new. It's new for me too. You call the shots. Okay? Hey. Come here. ♪ And I'm sorry I was evil ♪ ♪ I don't do that anymore ♪ ♪ I just copy other people ♪ ♪ Try to forget what was before ♪ ♪ This is the punishment For one and all ♪ ♪ It's exactly what I wanted Don't call it off... ♪ Oh, Tabitha. Look who's here. - Hey. - What are you doing here? I thought you said we could talk. No, you said that. Well, I'm going to go upstairs. Brady, we'll see you at the Stanford event? What do you mean? Why would you be going? Play nice, you guys. So, that's what you were talking about. Sit. It's just weird. For two years, we talked all the time, and now it's like... It's like we're strangers. That's what happens when people break up, Brady. I know, but... I mean, I got all this shit going on in my life right now. Like they found my car yesterday. And I took out my phone to text you, but then I realized... - I couldn't. - They found your car? - At the bottom of Lake Oswego. - Who found it? I don't know. My dad just got a call from the police. They know who did it? No, not yet. I don't know what to say, Brady. Yeah, I know, it's... - It's fucking crazy. - No, I mean to you. You can't walk into my house like this. Look, I'm not your girlfriend anymore. Okay, okay, but... Look, I miss you. And I miss us. - Don't you? - I think you should go. - Why do you have to be so mean to him? - Are you serious? He's trying, okay? Give him a break. He misses you. - Mom, you don't get it. - What don't I get... I mean, he wasn't nice to me. I mean, you want that for me? God, what's wrong with you? - Nothing's wrong with me... - No wonder Dad cheated on you. I got to go. Just a second, Spencer. Hi, can I help you? Hi, I'm Tabitha, Elodie's friend. Is she home? Elodie is grounded right now. She can't see you. Um... okay. Bye. Fuck.
