 ["Bite The Hand" playing] - Is that her? - Yes. [Tabitha crying] ♪ I can't hear you ♪ ♪ You're too far away ♪ ♪ I can't see you ♪ ♪ The light is in my face ♪ [Rachelle] I heard she was totally flirting with a cater waiter. Anyway, Brady was like, "Enough of that shit." So he dumped her. That is so not wha... I mean...

 why would she post that pic if he broke up with her? 'Cause she wanted to make him jealous. Duh. That's why she wrote "Big mistake." ♪ I can't love you how you want me to ♪ ♪ Here's the best part ♪ ♪ Distilled for you ♪ ♪ But you want what ♪ ♪ I can't give to you ♪ ♪ Your hands are gravity ♪ ♪ While my hands are tied ♪ You think she fucks? Can we talk? Okay. So, what do you want to talk about? Look. Posting that photo was dark, Brady. Even for you.

 Mm. And look, I get if you need everyone to believe that you broke up with me. It's fine, but... Can I get my watch back? And then we never have to talk to each other again. [scoffs] What watch? [school bell rings] [teacher] All right. I'm going to pair you off with your lab partners. This will stand until the end of the semester. There'll be no switching partners. Your struggle is not real. All right? Station one. Lisa Freeman, Jenny Moton. Station two, Richard Hilner, Lilah Portillo. Station three is Moe Truax... Noah Simos. Then we got Adam Burch, Chelsea Donnison. Max Cooperstein, Cameron Jin. Holden Robinson... Emily Weck. This doesn't feel like a coincidence. It's probably because it feels more like fate. Tell me I'm wrong. All I know is I need at least a B in this class to play soccer. And Mr. Sheriff, he seems very invested in my sports career. Oh, it's career now, right? Yeah, this all checks out. Seems very legit. What? Uh... What's, uh... What's going on with your book over there? - Oh, so you think you're cute now? - Yeah. As cute as your little lemming. So, let's get to work, shall we? [Luka] Was it a good one? I'm sorry? Your birthday. Moe mentioned it at the last meeting. It was kind of... overwhelming? Yeah, I feel that. I never cared for that much myself. Never had money for any extras. As a kid I used to lift the cupcake from the grocery store just to have something to put a candle in. That's so sad. Yeah, well, look where that got me. Hey, you okay? Another exciting day at SA. - What's up? - Hi. See you in there. How are you? - Been better. - People are assholes. I just don't know why it's bothering me so much. You know, it's not like I haven't posted a photo just as revealing before. Yeah, because you didn't post this. He did. Yeah, I know. Dude, that fuckhead totally violated you. Brady posting that picture against your will is criminal. I hate him so much. I think the meeting is starting, but... - we don't have to go in. - Yeah. Yeah, why don't we just do something to take your mind off it? We could go to the mall. I'll lift you anything you want. That's fine. All I want now is my granddad's watch and to never have to deal with Brady again. Wait, he has your watch? I left it in his glove compartment right before the party. Did you ask for it back? Yeah. Oh... We're getting your watch back. ["Kitana" playing] ♪ Kitana, Kitana, Kitana, Kitana Mortal Kombat, I'll see you mañana! ♪ ♪ Mortal Kombat, I'll see you mañana!

Like, what if someone legit needed to park here? Hey, there she is. She looks a little weird. She is a little weird. It's why we keep her around. So, did you get it? Well... the thing is... - Have you learned nothing? - Ah! Baller! And no one saw you? It was brutal, but I made it out. [Moe] Come on. Let's get the watch. Got it. [car horn honking] I don't see a placard. Please move. - [car engine starting] - What now? - Don't do that. - I got to move the car. Don't let her see your face. Thank you, sir. - [chuckles] Sir... - Don't even... - Sir. - I said don't! Guys, let's just pull over right here and be done with it. Wait, why? Why? 'Cause we got what we came here for. - Right? - Right, let's get out of here. Exactly. [car engine revs] Holy shit, Moe. - What are you doing? - Having some fun. I'm just going to go on record and say that this is a really bad idea. Jesus, Elodie. You're like a black belt shoplifter. Why are you being so lame? This isn't shoplifting. It's grand theft auto. Okay, let's take a breath. We are going to return the car, right? Yeah, man. We're just taking it for a spin. He would hate this, right? Yeah, more than anything. Oh, boy. ["Fast Slow Disco" playing] [laughs] [Tabitha] Okay, now what? We're going to have to have a plan. Oh! How about we slash the tires and leave the car at his house, - and then... - No, Moe, we can't hurt the car. Brady is gonna freak. Hurt the car? Tabitha, it's a car. God, I can't with the irony right now. How about we take the car to a junkyard, to show him what his prized possession is actually worth? Eh... How about we just drop it off back at school? [scoffs] Lame. Or not. I mean, just not at our school. At South. That way Brady just thinks it's just a part of some douchey prank. I could get behind that. - You? - You're going to do it anyway, so I guess. ♪ I sway in place ♪ ♪ To a slow disco ♪ ♪ And a glass for the saints ♪ ♪ And a bar for the road ♪ ♪ Am I thinking What everybody's thinkin'? ♪ ♪ I'm so glad I came But I can't wait to leave ♪ ♪ Slip my hand from your hand ♪ ♪ Leave you dancin' with a ghost ♪ ♪ Slip my hand from your hand ♪ ♪ Leave you dancin' with a ghost ♪ [laughs] ♪ Don't it beat a slow dance to death? ♪ ♪ Don't it beat a slow dance to death? ♪ ♪ Don't it beat a slow? ♪ [laughing] ♪ Don't it beat a slow dance to death? ♪ Milkshakes! Gotta say... this life of crime is growing on me. I just wish we could see his face when he goes out into the lot and can't find his car. He'll probably think it got towed. No. How does Oreo ice cream never get old? [laughs] Okay, if you had to, would you rather... give up ice cream or sex... for the rest of your life? Well, considering I've never tried sex... One point for ice cream. Am I going to be eating ice cream for the rest of my life? No, trust me. You're gonna find someone. I miss liking someone. Honestly, thinking about Zoey was the best part about her. I miss having someone to think about while I do my math homework. Okay. Would you rather have one good crush for the rest of your life, but the feelings aren't mutual, or be in a blah relationship forever? - Easy. One good crush. - Yeah. Crushes are the best. So true. - But I think I'd miss sex. - All right, then. So would you rather have sex with... Jack Gitmen... or Max Patel? Ew! - [chuckles] - Gross! Neither. - No, you have to choose one. - I choose abstinence. Right, okay. So, would you rather have sex with... Max Patel or... Noah Simos? - Uh... - I saw your phone. Okay. Checkmate. You got me. - You like Noah? - Maybe. Well, we, like, worked together in the summer and when it was slow, we would, you know... What? What? What are you thinking? - Just say it. - I just think you should be careful. What is that supposed to mean? He and Kayla have a thing. I mean, she still likes him and she doesn't give up easy. Don't want to see you get hurt. Yeah, it makes two of us. You mad? No. No. All good. Let's roll? All right. You're up, Albuquerque. No, I'm good. What? No. Come on, it's your turn. Uh... I don't really like driving. No, trust me. This car will comfort you. I don't even know where we are right now. South is literally a mile away. Yeah, you've got this. [chanting] Elodie! Elodie!

Where am I going exactly? - Uh, just keep the lake on your left... - Oh, my God. - Wow! - Seriously? [indistinct chatter] - [Moe] Dude, I'm the DJ. That's my job. - Guys, where am I turning again? The one up ahead. - Right? - No, the left. - Not that one... - [indistinct chatter] - You better work. - No, no! The next one! - Look out! - Oh, shoot! [metal scraping] [tires screeching] Shit. - It's not that bad. - [Tabitha] Shit. Shit, shit! - I'm so sorry, Tabitha. - We shouldn't have made you drive. It's my fault, I'll take the blame. No, fuck that. Nobody is taking the blame. Okay, my brother's friend is a mechanic. - He can fix this. - God, I'm so fucked. Shh. Don't say that. Brady is gonna be so pissed. I'll tell him I was driving, I was behind the wheel. No, I'm the one who drove it out of the lot. [sighs] But it's my mess. It's gonna be okay. You guys don't get it. I spilled coffee... in Brady's car on the way to school last spring. That was the first time that he hurt me. [sniffles] [sobs] You know, I lied to my mom about the bruise... 'cause I thought it was just going to be a one-time thing. But it just kept on happening. God, I'm such an idiot. Don't say that. No, I just can't believe I lied for him. [sobbing] - I'm pathetic. - No! You're not, you ended it now. That's all that matters. Guys, what am I going to do? We got this. Yeah. We can fix this. I don't think so. I'm done being scared.
