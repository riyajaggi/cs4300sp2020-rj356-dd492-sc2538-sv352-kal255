 Our theory, and Internal Affairs' theory, is that Bengt Skare killed Tommy Hagen. If it weren't for his debt to Josef, none of this would've happened. -It's worth 200 000 kroner. -And the rest of the money? Where's our stuff? At this time, we can only say that it involves drug trafficking, and that Lars Andreassen is implicated and in custody. I know you've been up to something. The question is why you're in the clear. -Who's that in the car? -A lawyer. I can't testify against Lindberg. If his lawyers start digging up dirt, everything will fall apart. The man who killed Elisabeth walks because of you.

 The phone from the car had codes from Lindberg on it. He always uses them. I've got him. Hi, Niko. 6 WEEKS EARLIER BORDERLINER Hi. -I'd really like to know what you've got. -It's nothing. Because of Lindberg? He was my boss for years, didn't you know that? Okay. And now he's sleeping on your couch? -No, we're friends. -Friends? -I'm able to keep that separate. -Good for you. Besides, he wasn't indicted, and he's back at work. -I'd really like to know what you've got. -What I've got?

 Okay. The two Swedish girls that we found dead... They were tipped off before they crossed the border. It's similar to the message Lindberg sent to the person I suspect is Eva Sundin. I don't recognize the number, but we're tracking it. It's just this one text? From March? -Nothing after that? -No. Lindberg has been in custody since March. -You haven't paid. -The car is gone. That's not my problem. You'll get your money when we've found our stuff. Hi, this is Kaja from the police department. We're looking for a new sheriff, and we need some help in the meantime. Please call me back. -This is Janne. -Hi. There's been some activity regarding that phone number we're tracking. I'll send you a screenshot of a text message. -Great. -You're welcome. Bye. I need you to keep an eye on cars in the area. -Grandad! -Hi! Look who's here! Kids, I hear they've got brand new toys in the common room. Go check it out. I'll come and get you later. When are you having kids? You're not planning on being single for the rest of your life, are you? I need you to keep an eye on this. Eva Sundin will start trafficking again. What did you want to ask me? Have you been texting Sundin about crossing the border? -Who wants to know? -I do, it's regarding a case. If you think we can do our jobs without doing undercover work, you're mistaken. Work that Nikolai doesn't know about? There's a lot Niko doesn't know. You're not doing so well, right? I've heard you owe a lot of money. I have a job for you, if you want it. Where do you get your merchandise? In Sweden, why? I see. One last trip, and your debt will be cleared. It's been quiet for over a month, and then this happened. The message contains a sun, and the other replies with an ice cream. That's exactly how Sundin communicates. Every time that happens, they send a shipment across the border. We need to look for activity in the area. How is this connected to your case? It implicates Lindberg. -I see. -He was released two days ago. Have you got authorization? Fine. You'll get a message. -Hi. Are you looking for Josef? -Yes. He's in Sweden. -I saw his car outside, so I thought... -Yeah, he took the van. Has he done something wrong? -Niko? -What? No. A Swedish woman came by. Okay? What did she look like? Short. Dark-haired. Is this her? Yes. Hi, Kaja. That list I gave you... SWEDEN Niko? Eva Sundin's car has been spotted five kilometres from your location. She's driving north on Highway 21. Are you tracking Josef's van? Yes, it crossed the border three minutes ago. Requesting permission to take Eva Sundin into custody. Okay, I'll check. You're not authorized to take Sundin into custody. You have to return to the station. Eva Sundin is in town now, right? Josef is in Sweden, and he brought a van. He'll be back soon. We can stop him at the border, but you need to act fast. Josef buys his merchandise in Sweden, there's nothing wrong with that. -Jesus... -So what have you got? An emoji yesterday, and Josef who's in Sweden doing some shopping today? And a potential Swedish criminal on her way into town? -Do you not want me to investigate this? -No, it's not that. So what's the problem? I just don't understand why you insist on going after Josef again. Why are you defending him? You have no idea what he's up to. Hello? Okay. What's this? A cloud? Wasn't I supposed to get a sun? -Go. -Let me talk to... Go! Kaja to Nikolai. We're ready. 5-3, this is 2-4-3. -Have you heard anything? -No. There they are. -I found this in the car. -Okay. Thanks. Hi, Josef. Been doing some shopping? You know how this works. It's in your best interest to cooperate. Take him to the station. They tipped him off. They used a different number. Josef was just a diversion. Or maybe you misinterpreted the emoji. -No, he thought he was smuggling drugs. -Maybe. But we can't keep him here. Josef doesn't know the car is empty. If he contacts a lawyer, we're screwed. Niko! That was some load you had there, Josef. Can you tell me who this is? That's Eva Sundin. And him? No idea who he is. Have another look. Take your time. I'll come back when you've had some time to think. You need to take care of the problem. Nikolai Andreassen. He doesn't know enough. He'll back off. He has to stop digging. Do whatever it takes. -Do you want some coffee? -No, thanks. Is there anything you'd like to say? You've been suspicious of me your whole life. What do you have on me? I'm just curious. What have you got? You stashed away money the last time you and Eva Sundin worked together. You went to prison, got out, and continued working with her. Everything you've got going... Your microbrewery, Grønnlia, your renovation projects... It's all just to cover up your drug money. Was that funny? No, not really. Very good. You can prove all this, I presume? You were notified today. You received a cloud emoji from someone affiliated to Eva Sundin's network. -I don't know what you're talking about. -Tell me who sent you that text. Was it the police? If you're going to keep me here, I demand to speak to my lawyer. -Eva Sundin? -Niko... I would like to speak to my lawyer. Lars? Your family is waiting for you. Hey, you. Daddy has unfortunately fallen ill. He's throwing up. Can you give him this? It's really nice. I'll give it to him right away. Josef? -Hi. -Hi. I owe you an apology. You're not the one I'm after. It's Eva Sundin. I don't know what she has on you... But I can protect you. As long as you tell me everything you know. And I'm just supposed to trust you? Hey... That thing with you and Lars, that's water under the bridge. No, it isn't! I lent your brother money to be nice. Three million kroner. How am I going to get that back? -Lars has promised to pay it all back. -Your brother is a liar. And you keep defending him no matter what. Why? Are you blind, or just as corrupt as he is? Watch your mouth. How did you know that the car was empty? This isn't over. Nikolai Andreassen has a different agenda. It's very important that this cannot be traced back to me. You can get it confirmed from someone else. Yeah. Bye. Hi. -I've tried calling you... -Kristoffer, I... -You should watch the news. -What? Just check the news. The police officer who accused Sven Lindberg of accessory to murder had a secret relationship with the murder victim's brother. Lawyer Kristoffer Lund has confirmed his relationship with police officer Nikolai Andreassen, who accused Lindberg. Hi. Hi. What's up? I'm in the office, trying to avoid peoples' stares. How are you holding up? -Have you spoken with your father? -Can we meet? Niko, I... I don't know. You should talk to your father. I need authorization to track a phone number. You have a relationship with one of the victim's relatives in the Lindberg case. -Yes. -And you weren't going to tell me? This is serious. I'm meeting with the management tomorrow. What am I supposed to tell them? I'll resign. Voluntarily. If you can confirm that Lindberg is working undercover. And if someone else can back it up, off the record. If it's true... I'm done here. How are you? -I didn't tell Sven. -You were the only one who knew. Come on... Why am I here? Because... I need your help. -More emojis? -Yes. Different number, similar message. I'm guessing it's someone in customs, or the police. I need help tracking the number. Why can't your boss help you with this? I'm asking you. I've tried calling it, but nobody answers. Try again. Maybe someone will answer it. I've been so proud of you. But you can't... You can't do stuff like this. Be together with Kristoffer? That's his name. You can sleep with whoever you want. I don't care. But I do care about the way you're treating Josef. And Lindberg. You're blind! You're so involved in the case that you can't see clearly! Do you think it's fair? To accuse someone without any proof? It's shoddy police work. I'm disappointed. Disappointed that I wasn't able to teach you better. Kids? We're leaving, let's go!
