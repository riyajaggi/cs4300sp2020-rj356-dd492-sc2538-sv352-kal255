 BORDERLINER 3 WEEKS LATER You told us about your investigation of chief of police Sven Lindberg following the murder of Elisabeth Lund. Yes. Elisabeth Lund was an informant and had infiltrated a crime network that imports drugs from Sweden. Only Lindberg and I knew she worked for us. -So you're saying Lindberg had her killed? -Yes. You had investigated and observed him for some time? Lindberg met regularly with his contact, Eva Sundin. That's her. This is footage from yesterday's arrest.

 Charlie 0-2 ready. -Go. -Copy that. Armed police! Don't move! Sven Lindberg, you are under arrest for corruption and accessory to murder. You are aware of the burden of testifying against a colleague? He is not a colleague. He is a murderer. Okay. Thank you. Hi. It was fine. Okay? I can come over now. Yes. What's this? I would like to say a few words on behalf of the whole family and myself. My sister Elisabeth... She wasn't perfect...

 But when she was taken from us, I got to meet you. All we wanted was an answer to who killed her and why. Now we are a little closer to that answer, thanks to you, Nikolai. I can't even imagine the toll this has taken on you, but you never gave up. Today, we're celebrating you as a member of our family. -You have to take some time off. -I don't need it. You know you have my support, but... Half of these people were mentored by Lindberg. -I know this is hard... -I don't think it's hard. It's hard for me. I'll find something else for you, but don't come back until this case is solved. Hi there. My boss is making me take a few days off. I see. Because you're testifying against Lindberg? Yes. I'm on my way to see my brother and the kids. Of course. My God... Tell your family I had a good time yesterday. And tell your family I said hi. Or not. -Okay. Bye. -Bye. Talk to you later. 50 NEW APARTMENTS IN FAMILY-FRIENDLY ENVIRONMENT! 6:12! -How did I do? -6:48. -No... -That sounds about right. -Uncle Niko! -Hi! How are you? You're so heavy! You okay? Have you been to school today? I'm going to get you... I don't believe you... No, no, no! Isn't this where...? Not a lot has happened here. Just wait until next year. There'll be 50 brand new houses. -This is a gold mine, Niko. -Is it too late to join in? -I don't know. Are you interested? -Not really. Can you drive us home? Sure. Of course. 6:48? -Give me a month. -I'll give you a year. -Did you buy new jerseys? -Was I supposed to? -You know you were supposed to. -No. Get your backpack, Erik. Share with your brother. -Did you visit mum? -Yes. -Weren't you getting a new car? -Yeah. It's on its way. -Come on, Erik. -I think you're doing well. Me too. -May we have ice cream for dessert? -No. -But we have a guest! -Yes... We do, but ice cream's not healthy. It's not fair that we can't have any just because you are fat. -Thanks for dinner. -Hey. -When are you going to have a kid? -Huh? -When are you going to have a kid? -Well... -It's nice, you know. -Say it like you mean it. -I do mean it! -Sure. Go to the pub if you want to. It's not a pub. It's one of those microbreweries. It opened a few weeks ago at the old prison. So big things are happening. Join me for a pint. There are always hot girls there. I'll get Hannah to babysit them. Come and see what Josef has done with the place. -Milla, don't you have homework? -It's Friday. Hey. Just go. I'll stay here. -Is it okay if I babysit you tonight? -Of course. We can watch a movie. POLICE I have to borrow your car for a few hours. -I was called in. -It's Saturday. Some guy hanged himself. We have to get him down. -When did you get home? -One? You shouldn't drive. Niko, it's all small roads! -What are you doing? I got this. -You're hungover. You need help. Swap the cycling for this, and you'll see results. Come on. Is that dad? Dad? -Hi. -Hi. What are you doing here? -Looks like you need some help. -Apparently. -Did I just see dad? -Yes. He was here when I arrived. Why? Walking his dog. He's hanging down there. Tommy Hagen. Remember him? -The gardener? -Yes. Used to be. He texted home and said goodbye. So his wife called us, and... Yeah. Marta. She's calling now. She must have called a hundred times. -Let's get him down. -Yes. Wait. Don't move. He probably fell on his way down here. It's slippery, and he was drunk. Don't answer it. Put on some gloves and put your phone away. Lars, don't move. Call the National Criminal Investigation Service. You're the sheriff. -You have to call it in. -Call in what? This was no suicide. -Hi. -Hi. -Anniken Høygaard-Larsen. -Bengt Skare, sheriff. -Nikolai Andreassen. -Yes, I know who you are. -Is it up here? -Yes. Who found him? Hans Olav Andreassen. The previous sheriff. -Andreassen? -My father. He was walking his dog. I'll ask him to get in touch. -Any family? -Wife and a son. Nine years old. Good luck to you. Good luck to us. My boss spoke to your boss. -I've taken time off. -Involuntarily, right? We're understaffed. -I quit the Service three years ago... -And you're arguing with the wrong person. He'll show you. Are you okay? I met Tommy in the pub yesterday. He... He was causing trouble, so I had to tell him off. That's not the reason he's dead, Lars. It's just... It doesn't feel good. He meant no harm. Who else was he with? Ove Dreyer. Right. Known to the police. He works as an orderly at the hospital. He does smoke a little weed, but nothing major. And Tommy's kid... Mikkel. He... He's in Milla's class. You've reached Hans Olav's voicemail. Leave a message. Dad, it's Niko. Call me as soon as you get this. Bye. You've reached Hans Olav's voicemail... There's something in the wound. -You'll get the results tomorrow. -And the powder on the jacket? I'll do it later today. It'll be in the report. -You'll check the rope as well? -Of course. -And the lungs? -Water can be detected during autopsy. -Thanks. -Thank you. Do you have kids? Why do you ask? -Is that an uncomfortable question? -Why would you assume that? I don't. You answered a question with a question. I don't have kids. I'm an uncle. That's enough. All the fun, and no responsibilities? -And you? -Why do you ask? No, I don't have kids. I've got a cat. That's enough. -See, I used your wording. -I noticed. -Did you find that transparent? -A little. Nikolai Andreassen and Anniken Høygaard-Larsen. Police. Have you come to tell us how sad you are that he's dead? Tommy was a drunk. I asked him to move out ages ago. He was a helpless, loud, self-centred drunk. -You received a text last night, right? -Yes. I woke up at about 6 AM, saw the text, and... -Yeah. -And then you called the police? Yes. If there was... If I had woken up... If I hadn't... If you hadn't...? Mikkel slept over at my parents' place, so I had some wine. That makes you sleep heavily. May we see that text message? Yes. "I can't take it anymore. I'm sory." Misspelled. That's Tommy. Helpless to the bitter end. He's not always been like that. Or, he wasn't always like that, he... He loved Mikkel. And the forest. The trees. That's quite ironic. Does he know? Mikkel. That his dad is dead. Would you like us to be there when you tell him? Yes, please. Mikkel! Come inside, please! I feel bad for the kid if his father killed himself. I hope it was murder. A father leaving his son like that, without a warning? He'll struggle with this for the rest of his life. Tommy Hagen died between midnight and 3 AM Saturday morning. A goodbye-message was sent from the deceased's phone at 2.30 AM. What we don't like, is the wound below the eye, and the rust found in it. It could be from falling, but nothing found on the scene explains it. He might have been injured on his way there. So we'll trace all possible routes, starting tomorrow. Today's priority is to find Ove Dreyer. He was the last person who was seen with Tommy. We'll try his home address first, and the bar where he and Hagen were seen by Lars Andreassen. Bengt, you're in charge of collecting phone records, surveillance cameras, credit card records... Ove Dreyer, this is the police! -We don't have authority to enter, do we? -Yes, we do. Neat guy. What do you think? I'll get the case. Send out a bulletin? Yes, to the station and the border police. As a witness, to start with. Niko? Hi! Pia? Hi! Long time, no see! Yeah. Hi. Pia. -Are you...? -Working. Is Josef Kolberg here? Yes. He's my boss. He was just there. He probably went inside to fix something. Okay. Cigarette? Come on! I've quit everything else! Hi. Josef Kolberg? -That's me. -Anniken Høygaard-Larsen, police. -Is this about Tommy? -That's correct. Are you here alone? Where did your colleague go? -He'd rather talk to your colleague. -Go figure. -Tommy Hagen was here on Friday? -That's right. He was here every night. He was really nice, but he caused lots of trouble when he was drunk. He always left a huge tip. Yesterday, it was 500 kroner. -So he was wealthy? -Or maybe he just liked me. -I can't imagine why. -No, I guess not. Was he in good spirits? A little too good, actually. I had to throw him out. -What time? -Let's see... About 1 AM? -Did he leave with someone? -Ove Dreyer. -Good to see you. -You too. Don't you say hello anymore, Niko? Seems like Tommy Hagen came into some money recently. What's the deal between you and the owner of the bar? My little brother, Lars. When he was fourteen... Josef put ten kilos of marihuana in his backpack and sent him to Sweden on a bus. Go to sleep. Milla... Dad never catches me! Hey... What's the latest you've ever stayed up? Last night, I stayed up until four, when my dad got home. That's not happening tonight. -Let me know if you need anything else. -Will do. -It's called being friendly. -Really? -Yeah. You should try it. -I should! Do you want to grab a beer at Josef's tonight? You seem to like it there. -It's called being friendly. -Ove Dreyer is at the border. He's been in Sweden since yesterday. We're picking him up. -I'm coming with. -I'll go talk to your dad. Lars, please show her where dad lives. Dad! His rifle is gone. He's probably out shooting at something. I should have mentioned this in the briefing... I got a call about Tommy a few weeks ago. It was someone who claimed he was abusing his son, Mikkel. Who was the caller? I don't know. Anonymous tip, but it seemed credible. -Did you pursue it? -I spoke to Lars. Mikkel and Milla are in the same class. I thought Lars could talk to Mikkel. Of course, he never got the chance. Hi. Nikolai Andreassen. -Is this Ove Dreyer's? -Yes, it's his car. He had a few too many bottles of liquor, as well as cigarettes and tobacco. -Did you send in the dog? -Yes. All clear. Thank you. -I need to tell you something. -We'll do it at the station. Okay. What will happen to my car? I didn't know Tommy was dead. Bengt told me just now. I see. Did they take him to the hospital yesterday? We'll do this at the station. -The night at the microbrewery. Friday. -I went home. He was thrown out. -I apologize for all the mess. -That's alright. -I'd prefer to watch this alone. -Of course. When Tommy was kicked out, I went home. Why am I here? Did you go to my house? Is it... You have been to my house. Because... That's nothing to worry about, it's... I can't sleep if I don't smoke. It's that simple. It's medicinal. If... Feel free to charge me. That's... But then I want a lawyer. Right? If not, I would like to go home and change, and go to work. Alright. Can I go? Yes. Could you give me a ride home? You know, since my car is... Alright. Hey! What is it? You're his brother! Tommy wanted me to come to the cabin. I didn't want to, so I went home. Tommy said he was meeting Lars at the cabin. There. That's all I know. Get in, I'll drive you home. No. Just fix it. What are you doing here? -I'm driving you home. -Cool. -Did you talk to Ove? -When did you get home that night? -What? -You said you were home by 1 AM. Milla says you got in at four. It's possible. I wandered around a bit. For three hours? I took a long walk to sober up. I know you saw Tommy. I just wanted to talk to him. He said some things, I responded. Suddenly, he pushed me up against the wall and choked me. I pushed him off, but he was so angry. Then he pushed me through the door, and I fell down on the ground outside. He picked up a screwdriver and threatened me. Stabbing it at me. I caught his hand. And I pushed the screwdriver into his face, and cut him beneath the eye. He stabbed me here, see? I wrapped my hands around his neck. And squeezed as hard as I could. Finally, he stopped struggling. He wasn't breathing. I did everything to try to bring him back. I tried for half an hour. But he didn't wake up. You have to know... You have to understand that it was an accident. Why did you meet Tommy? You know Mikkel, his kid? Yes. I talked to Bengt, he... He mentioned something. Was that it? Was it because he was abusing his son? I thought that if... If he realized that someone knew, he'd stop. And you thought it was a good idea to deal with it when you were drunk? Fucking stupid. They don't have any proof. It looks like suicide. No, it doesn't. I'm your brother! We'll continue this down at the station. What happens to Milla and Erik? Get out. Get out. Get the fuck out! Close the door. DARTS CONTEST REGISTRATION Even if Tommy was abusing his son, he didn't deserve... I know, I know. I know. It was an accident. Tomorrow morning, you're coming with me. We'll find Tommy's blood somewhere that explains the cut under his eye. -And you'll remain calm! -Yes, yes! Thank you. Hi, it's me. I think it'll be okay.
