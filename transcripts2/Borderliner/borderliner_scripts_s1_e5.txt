 The car hit the elk and went off the road. PREVIOUSLY ON BORDERLINER There were drugs everywhere. That's enough to pay off Josef. -If we do this... -We're in it together. No matter what. I pushed the screwdriver into his face and cut him beneath the eye. I wrapped my hands around his neck. He wasn't breathing. You can make the wound look like an accident, right? He'd been roaming the forest for weeks. I had to take him out. There are more people involved.

 They want the names of everyone who was at the briefing following Tommy's murder. And everyone who's been at the scene must register their DNA. The screwdriver you stabbed Tommy with has to be removed. You said it would be over by now! In order to keep Anniken away, I can only see one option. I have to tell them that I killed Tommy Hagen. SWEDEN NEW MESSAGE SENDING BORDERLINER OUR LAST FAREWELL MARTA, MIKKEL I haven't been totally honest with you. I'm involved in this case. I killed Tommy Hagen.

 It was an accident. I panicked. If I'd been caught, my career would be over, and Lindberg would've walked. Okay? I'll say that I was tipped off by an informant that Tommy Hagen was involved in drug trafficking. When I came here, I found him and started watching him. That night, I followed him from the brewery to the cabin. He got scared and attacked me. I had to defend myself. I held him down, for too long. I tried to revive him. But it didn't work. I made it look like suicide by hanging him from a tree, and I texted Marta. From that point on, we'll tell it like it is. You weren't involved in this as anything other than police officer. Okay. It's worth at least 200 000 kroner. Let's make it 100 000 off my debt. It's a really good deal. I'll sort out the re-registration. And the rest of the money? This isn't exactly reassuring. I'll need a few months, but if you help me, I can get it all right away. How? I'm in possession of something. What's that? Something you know more about than I do. You know, from your past. -What are you up to, Bengt? -Just forget it. -Answer me, Bengt... -I said forget it! Take the bike, and I'll take care of the rest. Don't take that tone with me. You're the one who owes me money. Park it at my place when you're ready. Kaja, have you seen Anniken? She's in the break area. Okay. Thanks. We need to talk. What is it? Ove's girlfriend showed up, asking for Anniken. -She's here now? -Yeah. She was in the cabin when we talked to Ove. We have to find out what she knows and get her away from Høygaard-Larsen. Now. Give that to the receptionist, and you'll get the items. We're done here. -Hi. -Hi. This is Malin Ekblad, Ove Dreyer's girlfriend. Nikolai Andreassen from the National Investigation Service. I have to go. Did she give you anything? She knows more than she's letting on. Was she getting the train back? I could drive her to the station. Maybe she'll tell me something. Thanks for the ride. Ove seemed really... desperate. Maybe you can tell me why. I've already testified. Yeah, I know. I was there when he was shot. I was driving the car. Okay. Ove seemed... Really scared. Terrified. It seemed like he didn't trust that we could protect him. They had found lots of drugs in a car, and... He and Tommy were going to sell it, but then... When Tommy died, Ove got really scared. He didn't want me to know anything about it. That night in your cabin, before Ove left... Did he talk to anyone? Just a Norwegian guy on the walkie-talkie. If you heard his voice again, would you recognize it? -No. -Are you sure? I don't think I would. But Ove told me his name. Bengt. It was him, and another guy I don't know the name of. They were the ones Ove and Tommy were selling the drugs for. It's okay. She doesn't know anything. Are you sure? She's just a confused 18-year-old who's lost her boyfriend. I don't think she understands what's happened. I'm not entirely convinced. No? -Are you lying to me, Niko? -How would that benefit me? -Where is she now? -Why? I want to talk to her. The way you only wanted to talk to Ove? Forget about her. She doesn't know anything. Okay? Niko? Just remember that I have that tape. In case you forgot. Hey. What's up? Have you talked to Anniken? That'll have to wait. We have to do something about Bengt. Why? Haven't you heard? Ove's girlfriend appeared. He's really stressed out. I don't know what he'll do. Fuck! -Bengt is dangerous. -Yeah. -That night of the car crash... -Yeah? Are there any traces of either of you in the car? No. You're sure? Nothing? No fingerprints? The tow rope snapped. Maybe something's still there. Did you touch it? No, I was wearing gloves. Good. Okay. Yeah, I can hold. Hi, it's Niko. Could you send me surveillance footage from the border dated March 4th? Great, thanks. -He went out to drink right after that. -Yeah, before he went to the cabin. He was discovered the morning after, dead, by you. We're going in circles. Reality doesn't change just because you keep asking the same questions. I need a DNA sample from you. You're not in the register. Okay. Do what you need to do. Dad! Did it go okay? I don't know what she thinks. Or what she knows, what she's picked up on. You didn't say anything? I should get home. ANNIKEN: Meet me at the station in an hour. I have something to show you. I asked the Organized Crime Unit about the drugs you found at Ove's. They sent me something we should look at. Look at this. March 4th, three weeks before Tommy died. According to the informant, that's a cocaine transport. -Why wasn't it stopped? -This wasn't my case, but... They let it through because they knew it was going to Oslo. The problem is... They were going to stake it out from here, but the car never reached that point. -Have they been reported missing? -No. -Two young girls. -Yeah. So the car should still be somewhere between here and the border. My dad had to put down a lone elk calf in this area a few days later. It's outside the hunting season, so maybe the mother was hit by a car. It's worth a search. Definitely. We'll search the water. The coordinates I sent you now. Yes, good. Bye. The divers will be there in two hours. And we have access to a crane. -Good. -Hey, I was thinking... If that car is involved in the case, and we have a leak on the inside, maybe we shouldn't... Agreed. Let's not say anything at the station. I appreciate you handling this. I have to look at the DNA samples. Alright. What's this? You understand that you can't just show up here, right? I told you, I can't help you. Take your guys with you and get out of here. -Aren't we friends anymore? -I just don't want you around. No? -What about your debt? -What? We're done with all of that. -Then we're not in agreement. -Listen to me! I don't owe you shit! Don't you understand Swedish? She needs your help. Find her stuff. Otherwise, you know what's going to happen. Thank you, Josef. Hi. I've found a solution for your debt, so I think we should meet. Coffee? No thank you. I've been thinking about what you mentiioned. That you're in possession of something. I know someone who might be interested. I didn't think you didn't do that anymore. I don't, but... I need a sample, so these people can try it. I'll take care of the rest. We'll erase your debt, and split the profits. Fifty-fifty. What are you up to? I'm trying to help you. -Is that what you're doing? -Yeah. How much are we talking? A lot. -Is it marked in any way? -Why do you ask? It'd be useful to know where it's from. What have you got? It looks like the girls died after hitting an animal, making them veer off the road. There are traces on the grill. But there's no animal here, so it may have survived and got away. And there was a tow rope by the rear of the car, but I can't say why. We haven't gotten that far yet. There's something here. -The same manufacturer as Ove's. -Yes. But this is too big for just a couple of petty criminals. -Hello, Josef. -Hi. I'd like a word, if you've got a minute. Have you seen this before? No. Why do you ask? Am I the expert? I just thought that since you run a bar, you might know something about drug circulation around here. Okay? You do know Eva Sundin, don't you? You do, right? It's no secret that you smuggled drugs for her 15 years ago. I don't know any of those people anymore. So she hasn't approached you over the last few weeks? No. Get in touch if anything of interest comes up. Yes, I will. -What's going on? -Take it easy. Go down to the tent and look at what we've found. Just take it easy. Yes, it's yours. Meet me at the velodrome in an hour, we'll talk there. One hour. Are you done with the forensic work at Tommy's cabin? No, because this came up. But we'll get it done today. Good. He's no longer a threat to just you and me, but to innocent people as well. I had to do something. I have a bad feeling about this. Bengt is smart. He knows this is his only option. Listen. If you get rid of the glove, I'll keep Lars out of it, not matter what. I promise. -And what about the video? -I'll delete it right away. We go to my place, and you could watch me delete everything. No. You're getting the hell away from here. The DNA results from the glove will be ready in the morning. You could catch a flight from Gothenburg before then. All of this just to protect him? He's the reason it all went wrong, and he's getting away? So I don't have a choice? After everything that's happened, you understand that, surely. Hi. I found this at the cabin as I was tidying up after forensics. Okay. I'll get it tested right away. What was it? An old screwdriver. This is Hans Olav's voicemail. Leave a... This is Hans Olav's voicemail. Leave a message after the beep. Hey! Get out here! -Relax! -You bastard! -You had it all along without telling me. -Yes. I went diving for that screwdriver. I almost died! I found it right before you arrived. I was going to show it to you. But then you brought Niko, how stupid are you? Get out of here! Run to your big brother. Hi, this is Lars Andreassen. I can't answer the phone right now. Please leave a message... Hi, this is Lars Andreassen. I can't answer the phone right now. Dad? Dad? He planted it. They found it at Tommy's cabin as forensics were finishing up. He's had it all along. What am I going to do now? -What am I going to do? -I don't know. You don't know? Do you know what this means? It means that I'll be convicted of murder. My kids will be orphans. You're going to talk to Niko now. -Huh? -Calm down! Stop yelling. Is someone here? Is it Tommy's wife? You're unbelievable! You're scewing his wife while all of this is going on? Could you please shut up? This is none of your business. None of my business? Lars... Come on! I'm in a hurry, we'll have to meet tomorrow morning instead. -Okay. Did you pick up some of it? -I've got everything you need. -Okay. -Bye. -Hi, Josef. -Yeah... I think I've managed to track down your stuff. -Have you finished the analysis? -Yeah. The blood from the screwdriver... It's not from just one person, but two. One of them is Tommy Hagen. But the other blood type... I didn't get a match until I registered the last tests you conducted. It belongs to Lars Andreassen. I should have known. Thank you for letting me know. Bengt! Get off the bike! Take your helmet off. Step away from the bike and take your rucksack off. Keep your distance. Put these on. Do you have a gun? I asked if you have a gun. Lower your arms. -You told me to run away. -Shut up! Walk around the car. Look at me. Get in. Go on. Get in the car. Get in! You had to take Lars down with you. Is that so strange? He and I were in it together. Before you came along. They've linked you to the glove. We're all going to turn ourselves in, like we should've done a long time ago. Wait. You know we tried to save those girls. We tried getting them out of the car. I was going to sell the drugs quickly. No one was supposed to get hurt. I tried to keep my cool. To be rational. I tried fixing the mess Lars made. Then there was the incident with Ove. And then... Hey!
