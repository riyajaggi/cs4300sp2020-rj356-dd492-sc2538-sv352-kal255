 -This was no suicide. -It was an accident. I'm your brother! Tomorrow morning, you're coming with me. We'll find Tommy's blood somewhere that explains the cut under his eye. Who's he waving to? This doesn't strike me as a man who's about to commit suicide. What did you use me for? The car hit the elk and went off the road. There were drugs everywhere. How did Tommy get mixed up in this? He saw us from the car. So he came over and asked for a cut.

 -How much was it? -Nine kilos of cocaine. And the two of you were going to sell it? Bengt must have moved it. We need to talk to Bengt! Everything will be fine!

 Watch it! Shit... You okay? -They were dead. -Yeah. Right? We did everything we could. -How much do you think this is worth? -That's ten to twelve kilos. Ten million. That's enough to pay off Josef. 0-2, this is 3-0. Over. -2-0 responding. -I was just joking. How many opportunities like this do you think we'll get? 2-0 responding. -Huh? -No, Bengt. This is our only shot. 2-0 responding. Don't worry about him, he's asleep. Hotel 3-0 here. Abort. Over and out. -If we do this... -We're in it together. No matter what. BORDERLINER This is the six o'clock news. The police officer accused of corruption and accessory to murder is 55 year old Sven Lindberg, according to Norwegian News Agency NTB. He was arrested by his colleague at Oslo county police department last Thursday. Lindberg was considered one of Norway's highest standing officers. VG claims Lindberg's colleagues are questioning these accusations. You're already up? They've named Lindberg. -Do you think they will name you as well? -Yes. -I'm sure they'll ask questions. -About us, too? -If it gets out. -Does that matter? -I don't know, does it? -If people hear about our affair, and you're testifying in a case involving my sister, then... Yes. Maybe. -Yes, I'm up. -I received a video from the hospital. It strongly suggests Ove Dreyer's involvement. I've waited outside his houseboat all night. He never came home. We need an arrest warrant. I understand. I'd like to look at it myself first, though. Okay. -Give me an hour. -Fine. Bye. -The autopsy report? -I called Janne to discuss it. She was in bed, so I went there to get it myself. This is before you get there. That's Ove. You didn't see him in there? No, I heard something, but I didn't see him. He's just an orderly, he has no business going into an autopsy room. No. Unfortunately, there's no CCTV in there. If Tommy didn't cut himself on the fence, it means someone placed the blood there. So we wouldn't look for weapons at the scene of the crime. I think it's time to bring in the divers. The weapon might be at the bottom of the river. That's one theory. Or maybe he went back to the brewery, through the fence. Tommy waved to someone outside the petrol station. That person might be able to tell us if he went back or not. Hold on. -Did he go in..? -This is what I'm talking about. And when he comes back out... There, it looks like he's taken something. After this, he makes several calls to a Swedish number, Malin Ekblad. At 2 AM he switches off his phone. After that, there's no sign of him. He's not at home either. What about at work? He starts in half an hour. We can see if he turns up there. I'll get an arrest warrant in case we need it. Do you want me to contact the divers? If we can't find Ove Dreyer today, then yes. Hi, Lars. Did you tell anyone I was going to the hospital that night? -Why do you ask? -Just tell me. Of course not. -I moved the... -I don't care about the drugs. -What was Ove doing in the autopsy room? -What? When? Bengt. Prepare a warrant for Ove Dreyer's arrest. Did he call you that night about the autopsy report? Yes, I was asleep. He said he'd get it himself. -Was that wrong? -No. When we find him, and we will... I'll talk to him first. Ready? I'm covering Lars' shift tonight, so I'm taking the rest of the day off. -Is your brother still on sick leave? -Yeah. Single dad with kids in primary school. That's a thing, I guess. Ouch, dad. -Sorry. -You're hurting me. Hi, Milla. You're embarrassing me. Have a good day, son. You too, dad! -Give me your phone. -It's switched off. Is that really necessary? Listen. Listen to me. Lars has completely lost it. His brother's in town. If it comes to it, they'll point the finger at you. -But you won't? -I'm with you. We're selling that stuff. We just need to keep our cool and figure out who we can trust. If I'm arrested, I'll keep you out of it. You won't be arrested. -Could he be with a friend or girlfriend? -I wouldn't know. -He'd let you know if we wasn't coming? -Yes. Give me a call if he turns up. -Why can't you tell me where we're going? -Lay down. Down! -I get carsick... -Lay down, damn it! -Hi. -Ove's not at work. Issue the warrant. Yes, the border police as well. -Bye. -Hi. Call me if you find anything. Bengt? I have to get out. I have to get out right now. I'll get you something to wipe it off with. -What are we looking for? -Stab wounds. Signs of someone taking blood from the body. That would be easy to spot. Nothing here. I've never seen anyone spend so much time and energy on a case like this. What about this one? It's possible, but it would have been difficult. Is there a way to determine whether the blood on the fence is from a corpse? Maybe. I can take a look. His wife and son deserve answers. Turn him over. First you show up at the pub, and now this? Fuck off. What do you want from me? You used to be good at finding stuff, and you know what we're looking for. 20 kilos is a lot. We won't stop until we find it, and whoever took it. Stop following me! Mikkel! What was that? Do you know what I've worked out? I climaxed at almost the exact same time as Tommy died. Isn't that just... fucking poetic? Poetic? I can't see you anymore. It was wrong before, and it's definitely wrong now. Fine. "Fine"? -Well, if that's the way you feel. -So you don't think it was wrong? I left some firewood in your garage. Let me know if you need anything else. -Who gave you that? -My dad. -Do you need help? -No! Don't do that. Stop it. Hey... Mikkel... Calm down. You're sure it was Tommy you saw at the petrol station? Yes, he waved to me. -And you saw where he went? -What do you mean? You saw which way he went? Yeah, he was stumbling down the street, and then he turned around, climbed through the fence and crossed the railway tracks. I tried telling him the brewery was closed, but he didn't hear me. Okay. Thank you. If she'd told us three days ago, she would have saved us a lot of trouble. If she's telling the truth. -Why would she lie? -I don't know. Let's say she's telling the truth. Then he went back to the brewery, cut himself on the fence, and then... Yes. Suicide. The divers can be here tomorrow morning. Right. I agree. It's worth a try. I'm staying until tomorrow, so I can show them around if you want to go home. That's fine, I've got the hotel room for one more night. -What do we do about Ove Dreyer? -Not much we can do. He's still missing. I'll see you tomorrow morning, then. If we don't find anything... -Then we'll go home. -I agree. Then we'll go home. Good night. Bengt. Where's Ove? The less you know, the better. That way you won't have to lie. -You haven't hurt him? -Of course not. He'll return once you've left. That went well. -I don't like lying like that. -Yeah. -You're certain he committed suicide? -Yes. I understand. You're going back tonight? Tomorrow. I'm spending the evening with Lars and the kids. -Are you coming back? -Yes. Soon. Okay. Good. The screwdriver you stabbed Tommy with has to be removed. You said it would be over by now! The divers are coming tomorrow morning. We have to do it tonight. The screwdriver's been in the water for days, there can't be... Yes, there might be traces of yours or Tommy's blood. I'm not risking that. -Your scuba gear, does it work? -I have no idea. -Well, find out! -Fine. -What about the kids? -Hanna. -She's out of town. -They can stay with dad. He's been sober for three months. It'll be fine. -I'll pick you up at nine. -Alright. Fine. Fuck! -Any word on Ove Dreyer's whereabouts? -No. He might have a Swedish girlfriend. He called this number 8 times yesterday. Malin Ekblad. Sound familiar? Malin Ekblad? No, can't say that it does. -I'll look into it. -No need. I'll do it myself. -Come on. Bring your backpacks. -You're staying with grandad tonight. Your uncle Niko and I are fixing the boat. -Let's buy a new boat instead. A sailboat. -Yes! -Where are we sailing off to? -Dad? We're here. -Grandad? -Grandad! -Check his room. -Grandad? -He's not here. -He's disappeared. In case you're wondering, he's over at my place. He seems really desperate. Come on. No, don't lay down. He's been sober for three months. Take it easy. Go to bed, dad. Your grandad is just a bit tired. -No, he's drunk. -Wasted. Yes, he's wasted. I'm really sorry. Is there anything I can do? No. Actually, there is something you can do. Can you watch the kids for a few hours? It wasn't Josef's fault, you know. He paid me to smuggle weed. I asked for it. You were 14 years old. Josef was 22. He used you. Period. You're still angry about that? I don't get it. He's not like that anymore. So a few years after being released from prison, he's loaded. Businessman? I don't buy it. He's worked really hard. It's not impossible. People can change. No. I'll do it. I'm the one who screwed up. -Do you know where it is? -No. It was really dark when it happened, so... It has to be in the water. I haven't been in the river since I was 11. Remember that we used to go swimming here? We jumped down from that branch. We couldn't see it at first, but it appears Tommy's blood was dead when it hit the fence. -So someone planted it there? -It looks that way. Do you think it was Ove Dreyer? He was... Høygaard-Larsen. We have the coordinates of Malin Ekblad's cell phone from the last 24 hours. -I'll send them to you. -Thank you. Janne? Thank you. See you later. You've reached Nikolai Andreassen. Leave a message, and I'll call you back. SWEDEN Lars? Lars? Lars! Hey! No, no, no... Lars... Come on. Come on! Hey... Lars. Come on, Lars. Hey. Hey! Your brother's stable. You can see him now, if you like. Easy, easy. -How long does he have to stay here? -We'll know more in a few days. You can pick up his belongings at the reception desk, if you like. Thank you. I'll go and clean up everything now. Don't worry about the kids. I'll look after them. What the fuck? You can go home now. Did you fix the boat? Where's Lars? Thanks for your help. When are you going to let it go? Honestly? Putting me behind bars wasn't enough? I've done my time. -Apparently not. -It's late. Yes. I'm trying to be a good person. -Yeah? -Anniken? Sorry, I had no signal earlier. I found Ove Dreyer. Subtitle translation by Libæk/Lie/Vassbotn OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
