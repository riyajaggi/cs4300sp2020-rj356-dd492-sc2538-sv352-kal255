 Some guy hanged himself. We have to get him down. This was no suicide. -Anniken Høygaard-Larsen. -Nikolai Andreassen. What we don't like, is the wound below the eye, and the rust found in it. It could be from falling, but nothing found on the scene explains it. Tommy was abusing his son, Mikkel. Tommy wanted me to come to the cabin. Tommy said he was meeting Lars. I pushed the screwdriver into his face, and cut him beneath the eye. I wrapped my hands around his neck. He wasn't breathing.

 -I'm your brother! -Tomorrow you're coming with me. We'll find Tommy's blood somewhere that explains the cut under his eye. I think it'll be okay. 3 WEEKS EARLIER BORDERLINER NO UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS NO UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS LABORATORY - OFFICE POLICE You know what I've done. Who I was. There's no point in hiding it.

 You know what I've done and who I was. There's no point in hiding it. I'm done with that now. There's no point in hiding it. I'm done with that now. There's no point in hiding it. I'm done with that now. You know what I've done and who I was. There's no point in hiding it. But that's behind me now. I'm done with it, and I've started over. Of course, it's an experience I'd rather be without. I have often thought that in many ways, Tista and I share the same history. My father was Johannes Kolberg. He was a mayor... an industrial initiator, a philanthropist. A lot fell apart when he passed away. The factory closed. People lost their jobs and moved away. They became disillusioned. So did I. And although this was a long time ago, I ask you not to forget. It took me a long time. Years after my father was pronounced dead, I realized that I didn't just inherit his money. I inherited a responsibility. That inheritance, that responsibility, gave me direction. Take the cultural centre. In one year, it will reopen. Just like in the good old days. To be enjoyed by all. I've taken over Grønnlia, with a projected 50 properties for families with children. I'm restoring the old prison, Jarregården. No, that's not where I did my time. It's been seven years since I joined the party. You can say I learned from the best. Now that the committee is gathering to nominate the mayoral candidate, I ask you to nominate me. I don't want you at the station until we've left. -You'll call in sick. -I can handle... No! You're leaking, Lars. Just stay away until we're gone, okay? And when will that be? When the blood sample is confirmed. Niko! Hey! -Thanks. -I didn't do it for you. Feel free to charge me. That's... But then I want a lawyer. It's a match. That's Tommy's blood on the fence. I see. I thought I was on to something. I'm sorry. -Nice to meet you. -You too. Good. About yesterday... I fell asleep on the couch, and when I woke up... -It was too late. -Yeah. Another time, then. Ove Dreyer seems scared during questioning. Can't blame him. Weed, cocaine... He was scared he'd lose his job. We haven't talked to your father yet. Dad was the district sheriff for 20 years. He'd have contacted us. But I'll talk to him. I'll keep you posted. This feels a bit hasty. -But it's your call. -Yeah. We'll go and see Marta, too. She deserves to hear it from us. Mikkel's going to ask himself what he did wrong. He's going to think he wasn't worth living for. He's going to feel that way for the rest of his life. Screw you, Tommy. It's okay. I'm sorry. I won't hold a grudge. I remember how you were. And I know you loved our boy. I'll let him know that. Goodbye for now. -Are you alright? -Sure... The situation with Mikkel is tough. My father killed himself, so I know what he's going through. But I'm alright. It's just unprofessional. I hope Lars feels better soon. Bye. Erik! Hi. -You okay? -Yeah. -How long's your break? -20 minutes, I think. -Hi. How are you? -Good. I have to go back to the city. -What about the football match? -I have to work. -But you promised! -I know, but sometimes... Fine. First the match, and then I'm leaving. -Okay. -I'll see you later. -Goodbye. -Score a goal, will you? CONVENIENCE STORE Any objections to the nominating committee's decision? Agreed. Beth Saidi is our candidate. Congratulations. Thank you. You had already made up your minds! And you let me make a fool of myself! I respected your father a great deal, Josef. He died too soon. You... What's that supposed to mean? Goodbye. Shit! -Is that a calf outside? -What? -Is that a calf? -Yeah. -Off season, isn't it? -Yeah. He'd been roaming the forest for weeks. I had to take him out. -Something's bothering you. Work? -No. I hear you're going after Lindberg. -Who told you that? -I spent 40 years in the police force. Sven Lindberg is the best officer I've ever worked with. Fine. When a body's found, you stay in town for questioning. You don't escape to the woods. -What were you doing out so early? -I was out walking Zorro. -Your usual route? -Yeah. You took Zorro for a walk on your usual route, saw the body, and then Bengt came? Do you plan on staying a few days? Milla has a football match today. Then I'm off to Oslo. She'd appreciate it if you came, too. -Do they sell waffles? -Is that a yes? I have to sleep. Yes? Someone didn't do their job. I asked Bengt to gather all the surveillance footage, but this... -He forgot? -He didn't care. I thought I'd check before I left. Then I got this half an hour ago. -No cut. -No. He'd have passed the fence on the way to the petrol station. Who's he waving to? One hour later, he's dead. This doesn't strike me as a man who's about to commit suicide. Maybe he went back to the pub? The fence is to the right. And why would he go back? It was closed. His blood alcohol concentration was 0.24. He was high on cocaine. So either he was with someone, or there's a witness who might tell us which way he went. You were certain something was off when you were at the crime scene. -No reason to doubt that now. -I agree. Good. I have a football match to catch. I'm already late. Pia, I know about your past. -And I too have a past, as you know. -I'm done with all that. I don't know about you, but I know that when you turn over a new leaf, we get judged by our actions. Do you agree? We can choose to either be sincere or fake. Yes... I took cash from the register yesterday. -How much? -500 kroner. I was doing shopping for mum. I will return it. I've been to the cash point... -Why didn't you just say so? -It was a huge mistake. -I'm sorry. -You're sorry? You know, my father was a great man. He talked a lot about forgiveness and all that. But I'm not him. I hate it when people lie to me. I can't stand it. Come on! Come on! Faster! Yes! Milla, come on! Unlucky! Nice of you to show up. -Anniken's reopened the case. -What? We have footage of Tommy at the petrol station. No cut below the eye. -He's waving to someone. Is that you? -No. I went straight to the boathouse. -From the brewery? -Yes. Did anyone see you? Did you talk to anyone? -I called Bengt. -Bengt? About what? About something else. Never mind. Faster! -You brought your phone to the boathouse? -I turned it off when I got there! -Pass the ball! -We'll discuss this later. -Shoot! -Chill out, dad. She's nine! ARREST REPORT BANK STATEMENT -How are you doing? -I'm okay. I don't know about Mikkel. I think he's very angry. This may sound weird, but... Tommy was never truly happy, except when he was with Mikkel. They were like two kids. A small one and a big one. -Did they spend a lot of time together? -When Tommy was home and sober, yes. But less and less, actually. Why? I think... Mikkel is growing up, and he understands more. I think it was hard for him having a dad who couldn't tell fantasy from reality. He made up stories about us going on holiday, he said he'd won the lottery. He actually said that. It was all bullshit, of course. He maxed out his credit card and hanged himself. Why do you ask? I need to ask you something. Something unpleasant. -About your dad? -My dad? About Tommy and Mikkel? Yes. More unpleasant than Mikkel losing his dad? Yes. He's unbelievable. He just got here. He's here. I'll talk to him. Alright. -What are you accusing Tommy of? -That was Marta? She lost her husband. Yes, he was useless. But he loved his kid, in his own way. Why were you at the crime scene one hour after Marta read Tommy's text? -Listen to you, the police officer! -Just answer the question. -Marta was here. -You're sleeping with her? In every sense of the word. But not since she was widowed. Even though I really want to. -So Marta was here? -Yes. She read the text at 6:10 AM. She woke me up, and we called the police. I went to look for Tommy where he usually was. How did you know where that is? When he's drunk, he can't go home. Everyone knows where he goes. Tommy abusing his son, that is just ludicrous... He has the prostate of a 90 year old man! He couldn't get it up if you flushed 70 litres of Viagra up his willy. I see. -But he had a heart of gold. -Says Marta? Says Marta. You met her, so you know she doesn't lie. -Lars? -Shush, I'm putting the kids to bed. Good night, sleep tight. Milla didn't want to go to sleep, she was so excited after the game. -Beer? -No, thanks. I think she likes football. Even if she doesn't score, she... -What did you use me for? -What? You and Bengt. What you said Tommy did to Mikkel, what Bengt said he did... What were you trying to cover up? You're going to tell me everything. Right? Start with what happened three weeks ago, when you arrested Tommy. I... I think I should call Bengt. Yes, let's call Bengt. The car hit the elk and went off the road. It was balancing on the edge of the cliff. There were drugs everywhere. -Why were you on this road? -We picked Tommy up at the border. He'd been causing trouble at a greaser-party in Sweden. There was a traffic jam on E6. Roadworks. So we returned by this road. -Who was in the car? -Two young girls. They were already dead. We couldn't get them out in time. Oh my God... We'll clean this up and make sure no one finds the wreck until the case is closed. Then we'll get the drugs and toss them in the water. In two weeks, I'll call in an anonymous tip about a car in the water. Someone will be missing those girls. I'll get some tools. -Is this the place? -Yes. We tried our best, but we couldn't save them. -How much was it? -Nine kilos of cocaine. -And the two of you were going to sell it? -Bengt says it's worth ten million. What the hell happened to you? I'm 3.4 million in debt. And Bengt owes 2.8 million. -The real estate project? -Yes. The company went bankrupt. Then we got a new investor, and now we owe him money. -Who is it? -He's really pulled himself together. -Josef? -Yes, Josef. -So Josef knows about this? -No, he knows nothing, I swear. I start work at midnight. We have 45 minutes. Tommy was kicked out, and I went home. Tommy went up to the cabin, and I went home. How did Tommy get mixed up in this? He saw us from the car. So he came over and asked for a cut. We thought he was out cold, but apparently not. So he got in on it. Then suddenly, he started throwing money around. I went up to the cabin to talk to him alone. -Were you there? -No. It was just me. How much does Ove know? He got a small sample to sell. It all went up his own nose. Ove is too stupid to make the connection, and too smart to talk. He won't be a problem, Niko. Bengt can control him. Lars can show you where it is. I need to get to work. -He's not here, you can go. -Okay. Thanks. Hi. She's been... Who is she? She's been asking about you. I don't know. -She asked about me? -Yes. -Hi, Josef. -That's me. -Nice place. -Thanks. -I recommend the beer. -Sorry? -You should try the beer. -I'm driving. I'd rather have coke. We haven't got any. You'll need to go elsewhere. -You look really handsome. -I don't know what you want. You act like you know me. I've never seen you before. If you don't want anything, then... What? Bengt must have moved it. I swear... Niko, I didn't touch the drugs. We need to talk to Bengt! -Everything will be fine! -No. I'm done with you.

The identity of the accused has not been made public, but the counsel for the defence claims the charge came as a shock to the accused. The chief of police is said to be prepared to fight these allegations until he is proven innocent. Neither the police authorities nor the prosecutor have any comments... Hi.
