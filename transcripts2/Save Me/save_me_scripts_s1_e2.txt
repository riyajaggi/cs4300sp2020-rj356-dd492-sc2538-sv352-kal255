 Sang-mi, what's wrong? Mom, I don't like them. Those people are weird. It's because we don't know them. -I'll talk to Dad about it, okay? -Okay. Hey, do you still think you're still a wrestler? Hey, stop eating. I said stop eating. Why are you eating so much meat at this late hour? I need to eat this much in order to go to sleep. I work like a horse and make money, and it's all used to pay for the meat. Do you know that? Stop it. You should never bother someone eating. You're being so harsh to me. My head... So much for being the only family... You little... Bros! JEONG-HOON'S RECKLESS CHALLENGES Come and have fun with me, Jeong-hoon! Okay! Now, today's challenge is to drink this Coke with Mentos. It's easy today. Isn't it easy? But I'm not putting these Mentos into the Coke. I'll put them in my mouth. I unpacked a lot of these. I'll put all of them in my mouth, and drink the Coke within one minute. Jeong-hoon, dinner. No, thanks. I'm full. Okay! Now... You're saying to eat dinner, because it's impossible? You go eat your dinner. Okay, bros. Jeong-hoon never gives up. I'll have all of these. Yes. Now, I'll open this last Mentos. Okay, wow, I'm nervous. Jeong-hoon, hurry up. I've made your favorite meat dish. Oh, come on, Mom. I'm not eating. She keeps telling me to eat in the middle of the stream. The love of my viewers makes me full, okay? Now, let's open the Coke. The Coke. Okay, the Coke is open. Now, let's begin. Okay. Coke. Mentos. Let's do this! Start! I told you to come eat dinner! Let's eat dinner. Are you nuts? It's live right now. We're streaming. You little... Come before I pull all of your hair out! -You loser. -Let's go, Mom. Bros, please wait. I'll be back soon. Shut up! You're not coming back. Bros, please press "like." Well, how about it? Do you like it? Oh, of course. I don't know how to thank you... It's okay. One of our church members donated a house, telling us to use it for the good, so we could get it quickly. I see. How about you, ma'am? The house is so nice, so... So, I think I'm dreaming... -Go see the kitchen. -Okay. -Please enter. Please enter. -Okay... The bathroom is behind the door. We cleaned it. -The room over here... -Yes. The Spiritual Father prepared all of these using the Water of Life. Separate rooms. It has separate rooms? The house is big. Do you like it? You can sit here and watch TV... Isn't it hard? -It's okay. -Honey, where should I put this? -You can put it in the bedroom. -Okay. Wow, this goes to the bedroom. You said you don't have that many things, but you do. -Let's do it together. -I can do it. -It's okay. -Thank you. Okay, we must be on our way now. Oh, don't just leave like this. Please eat with us before you leave. No, thanks. We have a community service today. Community service? Yes. It's a campaign about helping the homeless. It'll be good for young ones to join, right? Wow, that'll be wonderful. Young ones need to be interested in things like this to make the world better. Then, can our kids go, too? Dad, we're not done unpacking... You helped us so much, and we wish to do something in return. Your mother and I will unpack the rest of the things. -Okay? -Wow, we shall be blessed. In fact, one of our service members for today is sick and he can't come, so we were worried. Is it going to be okay? GOOSEONWON SALVATION, ETERNAL LIFE You just need to pass out the flyers, so it's not difficult at all. GOOSEONWON SHARES CLOTHES FOR THE POOR Wow, Sang-mi is so pretty, so people might fight. Apostle Jo, you know that the Mighty New Sky does not judge people on their appearances, but by their hearts. We shall be blessed! Yes. He judges by the heart. Please don't get it wrong. What I mean is that you're also beautiful in your heart. Are you ready? -Wow, sir. Is your livestock growing well? -Yes. NO. 2, HAN YONG-MIN/WORKS WITH HIS LIFE FOR MOOJI! NO. 1, CHEON JAE-SUN Hi. Thank you. A helping hand for the unfortunate neighbors. -Ma'am. Have a cup of coffee, please. -Thank you. -I need to go to the restroom. -Oh, okay. It's in that terminal over there. Have some tea, please. It must've been an emergency. Wow, hi. Hi. Yes, thank you. Hi. SALVATION, ETERNAL LIFE That Seoul girl is rude as heck. Is she looking down on us for living in Mooji? She's not looking down on us for living in Mooji. It's because you're rude. -Enough. Why are you following us here? -The women's restroom is full. Hey. You should say sorry if you bumped into someone. I'm sorry. What the heck? "Salvation, Eternal Life"? What are you? A Christian? No, I'm just helping... What? The way he talks tells us that he's from Seoul. -Are you from Seoul? -Yes. This loser talks like a girl. Hey, teach him a lesson. No, don't do this. Don't move. Let go. Oh, please. Don't do this. Don't move. Are you embarrassed because there's a girl here? I don't even care about him. Then you go lock the door. What are you doing? Let go. Stop it. SALVATION Sang-jin. Are you okay? Yes... Oh, my! Sang-jin, you must be tired. Right? Oh, no! Hurry and get in. Sang-mi. Are you sick? No... It's nothing... I heard that twins are mentally connected even without saying anything. What was it called? Telepathy. Does such a thing exist? Sometimes we do feel something even without saying it. Sang-jin, I envy you. You have such a beautiful sister. Sang-jin. Yes? Slowly. We have an evening worship right after this. I'm sorry we couldn't buy you dinner. It's okay. Goodbye. There's this famous Korean beef restaurant in Mooji. It tastes so good, so let's go there together someday. You both like meat, right? Yes. See you next time. You worked so hard today. Take some rest. Okay. Let's go. Let's go there someday. Sang-jin. Something happened earlier, right? No. Nothing happened. Don't lie to me. Sang-mi. Mom and Dad are having a hard time, too. So, don't say anything for now. Please. I beg you. Okay. I won't. LAUNDRY ROOM Okay, now, let's wash your legs. Oh, my. Well, I see you released your bowels. Well done, sir. Now, let's take off your underwear! Slowly. Lift your bottom. Come on. Oh, my. Spiritual Father! You're doing this again. Please stop. Oh, it's okay. I'm done. Oh, seriously. Why do you wash those things, soiled with the patients' poo, with your hands? They're dirty. -We have the washer right here. -Did you say "dirty"? It's not dirty at all. Oh, my... You're praying every single night and you're doing this, too. I'm worried that you might get sick. Then I'd like to receive a massage from you. How did you know that I'm good with massages? Give them to me. I took care of my mother-in-law until she turned 80, so I'm good at washing feces-stained laundry! Oh, wow, you really shouldn't. BULLYING PREVENTION CAMPAIGN "HAPPY SCHOOL WITH NO BULLYING" -Ju-an! -Hurry up! Hurry up! Go in. Hey, Dong-chul. Dong-chul. It's a destiny, don't you think? Now, everyone, be quiet. She must feel awkward because she's from Seoul, so be nice to her. Okay? -Okay! -Say something to your new friends. I'm Im Sang-mi. Oh, she's from Seoul! You never heard of Seoul dialect? Don't act like dummies. Han Sang-hwan. Yes! Do you see the seat next to him? That's your assigned seat. Go sit there. He's so lucky! -I envy him. -I'm envious. Han Sang-hwan. -Yes. -Sit down. Yes. Where were we yesterday? HOW HAVE YOU BEEN DOING? Eat with us, dear friend! This isn't the way to eat it. Mix it up like this, huh? This is the best way to eat it. Now, time for the finishing touch. Wow, this looks like dog food. Really. Come on. Eat it. It's not that... Just eat it. Hey! Eat it. Hey, I said eat it! What the... Damn it! What the heck? Apologize. What are you? His girlfriend? If you don't apologize now, I'll call the police. This must be his sister. -Sister? -I heard he has a twin sister. That girl is the one. Is that girl your sister? Really? -Then you pay to clean my clothes. -You bullied him first. Any proof? Guys, if any of you saw me bullying him, come out and tell, okay? I said, come out! Say something! You all saw it! What a funny girl. Hey. How about being my girlfriend? I'll be nice to you. What the heck? Hey, are you crazy? Hey, are you crazy? Hey! What are you doing? This is embarrassing. Hey. If you move one more step, I'll smash you into pieces. Hey, don't you know who I am? Are you two totally nuts? I was the king of Moojin Middle School. -King. -King. King of what? Losers? -Idiots. -Stinky feet. Awesome. Are you sure you want to do it? Want to have a one-on-one battle with me today? HAN SANG-HWAN Byung-seok, let's go for today. No, I'm not going. I'm going to kill them. That's not the problem. That's Han Sang-hwan. Who's Han Sang-hwan? What are you two whispering about? You're saved by the bell today. We'll see you later. Okay? -Let go. -Sure. We'll see you later. What the heck? -Are you guys okay? -Yes. Those guys won't end it today. Tell the teacher. Didn't you hear me? -Those guys... -Thank you for helping us today, but we'll take care of it from here on. -Throw. Just throw. -Look. -Wait. -Pass! -Pass! -Swoosh! -Oh, hi. -Hi! I heard that you had a fight with the king of Moojin Middle School during lunch. Hey, we didn't have a fight. When he heard the name Han Sang-hwan, he ran away. High five. That's how powerful the young master of Mooji is! Right? He's different from low class like us. Low class. Butcher. -Choi Man-hee the low class. -Woo Jeong-hoon the low class. Hey, how about a battle? At an Internet cafe? What a punk. He's as big as a mountain, but as keen as a weasel! Hey, I'm sorry, but you guys go have fun without me. Bye. -Where are you going? -Hey, if you drop out, it won't be 2 on 2. -If you're dumb, at least be keen. -Okay. Sorry. I'm leaving. -Hey. I'm leaving, too. -What... Are you sick? It's your mother's birthday, right? Straighten your shoulders, stand tall. You idiot. You stand tall. I said, stand tall, you jerk! You stand tall! MOOJI HIGH SCHOOL Sang-mi. I came here for community service nearby, and I stopped by just in case, and I just saw you two walking out. Apostle Kang said that she has something to give you. Do you have a moment to go to Gooseonwon? Yes. Okay, then. Let's go! THANK YOU FOR STAYING BY MY SIDE ALL THE TIME - HAN YONG-MIN! Mom. You need to get well. Do you know much Dad and I are waiting for you to get well? GOOSEONWON DEER ANTLER DRINK I'm not sure if I can accept this. I'll call Dad and ask him... Would you please stop doing that? If someone shows his or her true heart, you must accept it. I'm sorry if I made you feel bad. It's because this medicine seems expensive. I don't feel bad. We're a community that shares everything in the arms of the Mighty New Sky. I wish you could accept us and be comfortable. Can you do that? Yes. Please listen to my prayer. It's so painful. I can't take it anymore. I just want to live an ordinary life like the other kids. So, please, listen to my prayer. I'm sorry. -I thought no one was around. -It's okay. The Mighty New Sky opens his arms to anyone, anytime. Okay. Then excuse me. Sang-jin... Would you believe if there's a way to escape the pain? The Mighty New Sky says that anyone can be saved from pain when a person only believes in the Mighty New Sky, not a human will, and prays to him. PATH TO SALVATION Sang-jin! Sang-jin! The phone you're trying to call is switched off. Please leave a message. Calling charges will apply. WHOEVER BELIEVES AND IS BAPTIZED WILL BE SAVED, WHOEVER DOES NOT BELIEVE WILL BE CONDEMNED PRIVATE PRAYER ROOM PRIVATE PRAYER ROOM What are you doing here? I'm looking for my brother. Oh, really? Yes. Do you have something to say? You have downy hair, like a baby. Okay. Don't be scared. This is a place where the church members suffering from pain come to pray. So, the prayers are mixed with crying, screams... and sometimes shrieks. Your brother is outside. Come pray with me here sometime. I feel sorry for only receiving from them. Let's go worship together this weekend. Yes! Even the blood siblings can't do this much for us. Our dear twins, how was school today? Did you make a lot of friends? We can't make friends on the first day. Right. No need to rush, okay? My son! How was it today? It... It was good. Yes. I can see that people here are so nice. They're simple and honest. I'll go to bed first. Why? Are you sick? No, I lost my appetite. Still, you need to finish your food, Sang-jin! Come on, he must be worried about being in an unfamiliar place. Sleep is the best medicine. Get some good sleep! Okay. Sang-mi, take care of your brother. You're Sang-jin's guardian at school. Okay? PATH TO THE SALVATION WELCOME TO GOOSEONWON FOR YOUR FIRST VISIT NO. 2, HAN YONG-MIN He won't speak on the car. He'll meet the merchants in person. Okay! Wow, Reporter Park! Please write a great article today! -Okay, time to get ready. -Okay. Goodbye. Mr. Han, it's time to go. Is there anything more impressive than this quote of, "I'll do my best to protect"? This is way too familiar, so even I'm not impressed. Okay? How about, "I'll protect with the heart of a father"? Sang-hwan! Stop for a moment, huh? -The time is... -Just for a moment. Boy! Oh, my gosh! I'll be late. Didn't your mother tell you to wear your tie correctly, even when you're busy? Right? Sang-hwan, as you know... I promise I'll be the governor once more and make sure your mother gets better, so don't make any mistakes until then. Can you do that, please? I'm sorry. You'll be late for school. -You're the one who needs to hurry. -Okay. Goodbye. Let's go now, shall we? Yes. With the heart of a father... Let's use this one. Okay? Confucius thought that the source of social chaos was the moral corruption of human beings. So, what was needed to overcome this? Benevolence! He emphasized the recovery of benevolence. Now, then! What's a human being? Now! I got reports about you going to billiard halls and bars every single day. You know what happens if you get caught, right? Yes! Are Han Sang-hwan and Dong-chul in charge of cleaning today? You two make sure to clean the classroom thoroughly and have it checked by me before you leave. -Yes. -Dismissed! Hey. Jeez. Let's do this. Rock, Paper, Scissors. -Rock, Paper, Scissors! -Rock, Paper, Scissors! Goodbye. Boss, please help me. Come in! Come in! Come in! Enough! I won't play with you! Why aren't they coming out? Isn't that the Seoul girl? She is! Is she waiting for someone? -Hey, move. -What? Hey! You should've told me that you're going to throw it! I told you to move! Did you? Hey, shouldn't we tell the teacher? About what? That Seoul kid? -Yes. -No way. Mind your own business. Hey! What? Do you think anyone would come and help you? Hey. Pray. You're good at it. Hey, are you okay? Help. Please, -please help my brother. -What's wrong? I think he's taken to the rooftop. -What? -It must be those bastards. Sang-hwan, aren't you coming? I promise I'll be the governor once more and make sure your mother gets well, so don't make any mistakes until then. Can you do that, please? You said you'll take care of it. Dong-chul, let's go play basketball. Hey, what's wrong with you? Don't ask us. Go to the teachers' office. Okay? Hey, Han Sang-hwan, are you really going to ignore this? Mind your own business. What are we? Police? Is it because of your father? -Don't say such a thing. -Why not? Did he tell you to stay quiet because of the election? I said, don't say such a thing. You. Do you like that girl? If you like her, you go help her. Get your hands off me. Sang-jin! Hey, keep doing what you're doing. We already did this before. And now you're embarrassed? This punk's pissed himself. Take your pants off, you bastard! Just go! Sang-jin, don't do it. Put your clothes back on. -No one told you to pull your pants up! -Stop it already! Then let's ask your brother. What do you want to do? Do you want to show the photo to your sister? Or do you want to play with us? Just go downstairs. Did you hear that? Your brother told you to go downstairs. Please. Let my brother go. Please. Hey, if you want to ask a favor, do it the proper way! Nothing's free, you know. You take your clothes off instead. Sang-hwan! Where's Dong-chul? Take it off. Hurry. Wow, my heart is pounding. Hey, listen to me. You're no longer humans. You're a bunch of trash. Shut up! Hey. You still don't know your place, huh? Without that Han Sang-hwan bastard by your side, you're a low class. Know your place, you stupid bastard! I'm in charge of cleaning today. What are you blabbering about? I'm in charge of taking out the trash today. Come on. Attack. Attack. You bastard! Get up. You bastard. Sang-jin! You witch! Hey, let's go. Okay, left. Then right. Left! Down! Up, down! Why? Are you intimidated by my defense? Hey. Hey! Where are you going? Let go! I said let go! Sang-jin! Let me... Sang-jin. Please don't do that. -I shouldn't have been born. -Don't say that! That idiot is being a total loser! This place is exactly the same. I can never get away from this. No, Sang-jin. I can change it! I can! I'll help you! The Mighty New Sky. The Mighty New Sky opens his arms to anyone, anytime. I'm sorry, Sang-mi. It seems that no one will listen to my prayers. What are you talking about? No! Oh, no... Dong-chul! Save... Save him... POLICE DETECTIVE Get out. Get out, now. Let go! I didn't do anything wrong! That bastard kicked him first! It's all his fault! Shut up. We need to go inside and talk. Get in. Dong-chul! Mister! Dong-chul didn't do anything wrong! Hey! I've been an officer longer than you've been alive! I can tell just by looking! Mister, he didn't do it! Dong-chul went to the rooftop so he can help him. Sang-hwan, the details will be revealed after the interrogation. You need to go. What on Earth is going on? EMERGENCY Yes, hello? Yes, this is Im Joo-ho. What? Hey? What are you doing? Why are you wearing my shoes? No. No, that can't be! Hey, lady! Are you crazy? Why, that... I'll carry it for you. It's okay. No red light. There isn't... Jung-goo! Hurry! Spiritual Father gives joy! Spiritual Father gives happiness! Spiritual Father gives love! We love you! The Mighty New Sky! Spiritual Father gives joy! Spiritual Father gives happiness! Spiritual Father gives love! We love you! Spiritual Father... Everyone, get up and dance with joy! Sing out loud so your song can be heard by the Mighty New Sky! Spiritual Father gives joy! Spiritual Father gives happiness! Spiritual Father gives love! We love you! Sing it! Spiritual Father gives joy! Spiritual Father gives... Everyone, are you feeling joyous? Yes! Are you happy? Yes! If you go there, you'll be a hundred times, a thousand times more joyous and happy. Do you believe? We believe! Then let's give a round of applause to welcome our Spiritual Father! Yes! Spiritual Father! Spiritual Father! Spiritual Father! Spiritual Father! Mom. Sang-jin. Sang-jin! Sang-jin! Sang-jin! I was praying at dawn today, and the Mighty New Sky appeared in front of me and spoke to me in a clear voice. "My son! You shall spread word about the secret of salvation, and save poor souls fallen into the pit of pain!" That's the revelation for me to send you to Mooji! Why? I can't find Mom. What? Ma'am. Where do the evil spirits exist? The evil spirits do not look scary, like goblins. Then? Evil spirits stay close to you and approach you disguised as a good person. Sometimes they come in the faces of your friends, husband, or even your children, to tempt you and destroy your faith. Oh, no. Then what should I do? Believe in the Mighty New Sky. And... believe in me. You just need to believe in the Mighty New Sky... and me. I believe! I believe in the Mighty New Sky, and you, too, Spiritual Father! Sang-jin! Sang-jin, where are you going? Come back to Mommy! Sang-jin! Sang-jin, come back! If you want to go to heaven created by the Mighty New Sky, you must ride on the Ship of Salvation. But can anyone ride on the ship of salvation? Can anyone pay money to ride on the ship of salvation? -No. -Never. The world is filled with evil. Large buildings collapse! Airplanes crash! Earthquakes occur! These things happen because of the evil forces! We believe! In this world of evil, the only one who can save us is the Mighty New Sky! Do you believe, everyone? We believe! -Mom! -Honey! Honey! Excuse me, have you seen my mom? She's like this tall. She's in her mid-40s, and was wearing slippers... I didn't see anybody... Lady! Please come down! -It's dangerous! -Sang-jin! Sang-jin! Come to Mommy. Where are you going? Hey! You need to come down! Sang-jin! -Mom! -Honey! Sang-jin, Sang-jin keeps running away. It's dangerous. Come down, okay? Sang-jin! Don't leave Mommy! Sang-jin! Sang-jin! Come to Mommy! Sang-jin, come here! Sang-jin, come here, please! -Sang-jin, wait. -Mom! Mom! No. Mom! Honey! The Mighty New Sky told me! I will be your savior! -Spiritual Father! -I will be your truth! Spiritual Father! I will be your father! Spiritual Father! The father of spirits! We believe! Son, your faith will lead you to the Ship of Salvation! We believe! Me, too! I believe! Daughter, your faith will also lead you to the Ship of Salvation! We believe! -I'm here, Father! -We shall be blessed! -We shall be blessed! -Spiritual Father! We shall be blessed! MOOJI TOP HOSPITAL Sang-jin, I'm sorry... It's all my fault, Sang-jin. Sang-jin! I'm sorry, Sang-jin... Sang-jin! REST IN PEACE Sang-jin! REST IN PEACE SPIRITUAL FATHER OF GOOSEONWON I... I'm the one to blame. It's all my fault, Sang-jin. I give you my greatest sympathy. I don't know what to say... It's just... so heartbreaking. Oh, it's okay. We're just thankful that you all came for a visit. I'm sure Sang-jin is resting with the Mighty New Sky. From now on, we'll protect you like family. Thank you so much. Ma'am, you must be in despair, but you must stay strong for your daughter Sang-mi. I remember you, Sang-jin, as a boy with less freedom on one foot, but you stayed at the chapel alone to pray. You were a beautiful boy... with a beautiful heart. But, everyone... when I heard the news about Sang-jin today... I couldn't pray at all. Everyone. At this time, I wish to stand here as a human being, not as a clergy. And I wish to ask the Mighty New Sky. Why? Why did you take... a precious son away? Why couldn't you, the Mighty New Sky, protect the spirit of a precious son with your powers? You said you'll save your children from the painful suffering! Then why? Why did you take him away? Mighty New Sky. I... I feel so resentful toward you. Answer me! What was your intention? Why did you remain silent to your son's prayer? Why did you break this family's heart into a million pieces? I must hear your answer. Did you really ignore the desperate cries of this child who asked you to save him? SAVE ME Sang-jin! I will... I will avenge you. MUSIC TOWN K-KARAOKE
