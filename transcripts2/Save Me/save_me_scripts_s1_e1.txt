 We believe! Are you okay? Honey, what's wrong? We got a flat tire. Oh, no. We believe! Everyone. Mr. Park right here... has late-stage stomach cancer, as we all know. Oh, no. Even a large hospital in Seoul sent him back home, saying that he was hopeless.

 - Oh, no. - What the... Is it true? It is true. Is it right to send a frightened patient back, who has death drawing near, saying that it's hopeless? No! Honey. Stand back. Go to the car and stay with the kids. - Honey. - Now! Everyone. But... our Mighty New Sky never sends a patient back to the dark valley of death just because something's hopeless, because he cannot be cured! We believe! We shall be blessed! We shall be blessed! We shall be blessed! It's completely deflated. Mister, are you okay? Yes. Mom, are you okay? Yes, I'm okay. These boys are trying to help us. Stay in the car. You'll get wet. Is there a car repair shop nearby? Yes, I was about to make a call. I'm sorry for troubling you in the heavy rain. It's okay. And most of the shops around here close at around 7 o'clock. And nobody comes this far in rain, unless you live here. Hello, Joon-goo. Yes, someone I know got a flat tire on the hill to the town. Okay. Then please hurry. Yes, please hurry. - What is it? - He said he'll be late, he has to poo. Mister, he said that it'll take 30 minutes for him to come. Please wait for a while. Okay. Thank you so much. How can we ever repay you? Repay? Well... It's okay. He'll be here soon. Don't worry. Let's go. Farewell. Okay. Thank you. - Jeong-hoon. - Okay. - Aren't you coming? We'll leave you here. - I'm coming. Okay. Thank you so much. Sang-jin. Are you okay? Yes. Don't worry. Nothing will happen here. That's not what it is. In the name of the Mighty New Sky, our savior... The satanic disease making my beloved son Park Doo-young suffer in great pain! Swoosh, swoosh. With the holy fire of salvation, the filthy satanic cancer goes away, swoosh. Spiritual Father. In the power of the Mighty New Sky... you'll be healthy and clean, like pure snow. Swoosh. Spiritual Father. Spiritual Father. Spiritual Father. It's gone. Now, this thing is... the cancer tumor of Satan. We believe! Everyone, let's honor the Mighty New Sky for this! The Mighty New Sky! The Mighty New Sky! Hey, that Seoul girl from earlier. Isn't she pretty? She has snowy skin, too. Didn't you see her staring at me? What are you talking about? She only stared at me. - Want to bet? - $10 bet? Deal. You jerks. She shot lasers at me with her eyes. Like this. So, I got shot, and so I said, "Ka-pow." Our eyes met, and there was electricity. So much for that "ka-pow." GOVERNOR HAN YONG-MIN Hey, do you think your father will be elected? He will. We have no one else besides Sang-hwan's father. Right. Ma'am, please hurry up. Ma'am, what is this? Why is it so black? Hey, are you trying to go to the police station again? I told you, I made a mistake last time because I wasn't feeling well. Wasn't feeling well? That's just stupid. If you don't want to drink it, go somewhere else. Hey... how did we end up like this? That's enough, okay? Here. Let's just think of it as black beer and drink it. - Let's drink. - Sure, let's drink. You damn jerk. Were you scared? Don't worry. From now on, everything's going to be okay. Jeez. Sir, it's done. Oh, thank you. Did you move from Seoul? Yes. Why did you move on a day like this? Well, they say that it brings good luck if you move on a rainy day. - Yeah, right. - Right. Okay, excuse me. Sir, please wait. Chinese black bean noodles are the best on moving day, right? You can get free small sweet and sour meat with ten coupons. Have a safe trip back. Eat. We're done. Let's eat. Everyone, I will sing a song and make you all happy as clams. Spiritual Father, brother Park says that he wishes to thank you. Pastor. No, Spiritual Father. Thank you so much for saving my life. I was thinking about how to repay you for such a grace you granted on me, and Apostle Kang told me on our way here. I heard that you're building New Heaven's sanctuary. I wish to help if I can. Brother. Do you know the name of this tree? We call this... the Tree of Belief. As you can see... it looks like an old hollow tree... but it has lived for 500 years with such strong branches. This is the wondrous blessings and miracle from the Mighty New Sky. - We believe! - We believe! Brother. I'm just a humble servant of the Mighty New Sky. So, don't thank me. Just pray to the Mighty New Sky, who showed you a miracle, and thank him. We shall be blessed. You've arrived at your destination. Dad. Is this the right place? I don't know. The address is correct. Wait here for a moment. Honey. Is everything okay? Well... Sung-ho isn't answering his phone. Honey, could it be... No, Sung-ho will never do such a thing. I'll call him again. Mooji 1-1, report. Mooji 1-1. What is it? We got a report about a drunk person in their 40s wreaking havoc in front of Mooji Bus Terminal. - Please go check. - Yes, sir. Sergeant. Sergeant Woo. Sergeant, please wake up! Yikes. What? A call about a drunk person. You got a drunk person right here. Such a horrible hangover. Sir, wake up, please. Yikes. What's with that guy? I'm going to smash everything. Testing. Sir, you shouldn't climb onto the car. It's dangerous. Please get down. You crazy bastard, get down right now! Get down! - Is he crazy? - Hey. You shouldn't do that to me. If you do that to me... This is driving me nuts. He's totally insane. Mister, stop it. Hey! Get down! Get down, you bastard! - Get down! - Hey. Let go! Let go, you jerk! Are you leaving already? It's past 8 o'clock. What are you, Cinderella? You go home at 8 o'clock? It's the weekend. Let's have some more fun. Isn't that right, Dong-chul? What are you going to do? Let's see. It rained, too... TUDARI RESTAURANT Jeong-hoon. Come here. - I'll be back. - Be back soon. - You're not causing trouble, right? - Of course not. What happens if you drink and ride motorcycles? I will crash. And you should call your mother and tell her that you'll be late. I was about to... - But, Father, your face... - Shut up already! And all of you. You're now in high school. You need to study. Okay? Yes. Sang-hwan? Yes? How's your father doing? He's fine. Right. He's the only one to lead this region. He'll become the governor. Thank you. Come on. Stop it. Stop it! Let's go, Officer Choi. Yes, sir. - Be careful, Father. - Goodbye. He deserved that. GOOSEONWON You'll be saved by the Mighty New Sky. Do you believe? We believe! - We shall be blessed! - We shall be blessed! The moon shines brightly It was made by the Mighty New Sky The moon of January was Made by the Mighty New Sky The moon of February was... Made by... Apostle Kang, how come you grow younger and younger every time I see you? There's a fountain of youth in this place. You mean the Water of Life? Yes. The water of wisdom given by the Mighty New Sky. Officer Choi, you need to try it, don't you think? Sergeant Woo. Spiritual Father. How have you been doing? Great. I live under the grace of the Mighty New Sky. Have a seat. We're always giving you so much trouble. No, you're not. You brought a lost lamb back to the arms of the Mighty New Sky. We're the ones who should be thankful. Oh, please. Ever since you came to Mooji, all of those wretched tramps are gone. We're the ones who should be thankful. Apostle Kang, how much of those deer antler drinks do we still have? Even after we gave it away to the elders, we still have 20 boxes left. I feel sorry for giving you the leftovers, but since you came all the way here, please take them and drink it. No, we're not allowed to receive such things. Sergeant Woo, this isn't bribery. You work hard night and day for this region. We're not really helping you. It's like sharing food with good neighbors, isn't it? What I mean is... Right, Officer Choi, your mother hurt her back, right? Oh, well... The Mighty New Sky told us to share good things with neighbors. This isn't from us. It's from the Mighty New Sky. So, it's okay. If you feel uncomfortable, you don't need to take it. We wish to give it to you with good will, but if the receiver feels uncomfortable, we shouldn't. Right? I am worried about word spreading because so many eyes are on us, and I get sick if I drink something like this. Of course. You mustn't get sick. That's refreshing. Hey, what are you doing? Hey, you jerk. Hey. Get out. Mom, why aren't you eating? It's okay. I don't feel so good. What about Dad? Hey, Sung-ho. You didn't do that, did you? Hey, you know what that money was. Oh, man. I told you I'll pay you back with interest later. Hey, Lee Sung-ho. Are you at a casino? Say it. Say it, now! Yeah, I'm at a casino. I conned you. You idiot. Hey, Lee Sung-ho. Sung-ho! Please leave a message... Dad. - Is it her? - It is her. - It's that girl, right? - The pale Seoul girl. Looks like they just moved here. - You saw their stuff in the truck, right? - Then why do you think they're at a sauna? Kidnapping? Oh, you're so stupid. No kidnapper ever brings hostages to a sauna. Then what is it? She'll see us. Seriously. She didn't see us, did she? Let's do this. Rock, Paper, Scissors. Jeong-hoon, a fist is the symbol of a man. Right? Go. You bastards... Stop that. Hurry up. I... She's gone. Excuse me. Are you hiring, by any chance? I... Excuse me, are you hiring, by any chance? - We're not. - For anything... We got no jobs these days. Okay? Are you hiring, by any chance? I can do everything... No. 2, Han Yong-min. You can count on me. Please vote for me. No. 2, Han Yong-min. You just need to make me win - Three terms in a row. - Okay. Please vote for me. Everyone, I'm No. 2, Han Yong-min. You can count on me. Governor, what are you doing all the way out here? Please be elected once more and save Mooji, please. Thank you. Everyone, Mooji is known to grow the best cattle in Korea. If you vote for me this time, I will support the cattle market and tourist attractions, too. Shouldn't you vote for someone who can work for Mooji, someone who understands the issues the residents are dealing with to its very core? You can count on me. I will make Mooji into a place where even the unemployed and the poor can live well. Everyone, if you can make No. 2, Han Yong-min serve three terms in a row, I will do everything with my life. Han Yong-min. Han Yong-min. You, the gentleman from Seoul. - Did you say that you're looking for a job? - Yes. Okay. It's in the corner... Your ill body will be cured like a healthy new body. In the name of the Mighty New Sky, may your ill body be cured like a healthy new body. Hi. Here it is. - Thank you. - It's free. Have some coffee, please. Thank you. THIS HOUSE PROTECTS ELDERS FROM ABUSE - You should have your revenge. - If you don't do anything, you'll be dead. We never did anything thinking of the outcome. - Right. - Then is everyone in? I'm in. - I'm in. - Let's go. Hey, do a high five. Whatever. Hurry up. Hey, you crazy bastards! I'll kill you! Get them! Farewell. KARAOKE ROOM What is this? Hey, I saw your face! I saw yours, too. I saw all of you. Get off! Fight me! That's something. We're... looking for workers from overseas, so we don't pay much. Is that okay with you? Yes, I'm okay with it. And the work will be tiring. If you just hire me, I'll do my best, sir. - Let's do it, then. - Yes. Thank you. But we heard that you provide food and a place to stay... Can someone stay with me, too? There's someone else? This isn't so bad. - Really? - Yes. If we can stay together, that's good enough. Okay. Sang-mi is right. Then how about moving our stuff in first, huh? - Be careful. - Okay. Come on, eat. You eat first. So the kids can eat. I'm so sorry... to all of you. Instead, I'll work hard and find a great new house as soon as possible. So, please wait until then. Dad. This is a chance for a whole new experience. The air is fresh and the water is clean. And we eat while cows moo, so it feels like we're camping. I love it. Right, Sang-jin? Yes. I love it, too. The food will grow cold. Hurry up and eat. It's delicious. Really. - How about you, Sang-jin? - It's delicious. Isn't it spicy? - Looks like you don't like it. - No. Seriously. It's spicy, isn't it? I don't think he likes it. What's going on? Come on. They all look so happy. Don't you miss them? It's not that much. Remember what the Mighty New Sky said? Love your neighbor as you love yourself. Come on, Apostle Jo... I can take care of it myself. I see. Thank you. - Put it away. - Okay. WELCOME TO BULLFIGHT Push in! To the side! Headbutt! Yes! Sang-hwan, Trickster lost today. Dong-chul, did you give him some special food? Bold Guy isn't that smart. Stretch out your shoulders. You don't fight with your brain. Right? You fight with boldness? Is that why you're scolded by the teacher? You need to play tricks. - Okay. - Sang-hwan, since Trickster lost today, you pay for the karaoke. Right? - Right? - Right? Right? Okay. Let's go. Stop. I have to go pee. Wait for a moment. - Okay. - Hurry up. RESTROOM So, this is where you were? I'm so sorry, boss. You sprayed on my motorcycle so nicely, huh? Stop. What are you? You don't understand "stop"? S, T, O... - P. - Right. - You damn crazy bastards. - What? You're in high school, just like us, right? Hey, run! Hey. I'm sorry. Hey, if you want to fight me, come find Woo Jeong-hoon of Mooji High School. This way. Hey... don't leave me here. Dong-chul. What do you wish to do? Do you want to be bold? Or play tricks? Hey, a man has to be bold, right? Yeah, you're right. A man has to be bold. Hey, stop it. - Stop it. Let's go. - Boss, I got self-esteem, too. But this is wrong, isn't it? Hey, didn't you hear what I said? Are you Han Sang-hwan? Yeah, why? Sang-hwan. Yeah, a man must be strong. Okay, then. Have fun. Let's go. That was nothing. - Han Sang-hwan. - What? Even though your father's a powerful man, I can't hang out with you anymore. Okay. Let's go. - Go where? - To the karaoke room. Dong-chul, are you coming? Man-hee? Karaoke room? Let's go. Let's go. - Let's go. - Let's go. I'll pay for it. Let's go for some karaoke. Mr. Im. Yes, sir. - The work is hard, isn't it? - It's okay. It'll be hard at first. But if you endure it and keep doing it, you'll get used to it soon. I did manual labor back in Seoul, too. Mr. Im, I'm 72 years old. I raised cattle for 50 years here. When I look into the eyes of either a person or a cow, I can tell what kind of person or cow he is. Mr. Im... you have innocent eyes. Like a cow's eyes. That's why I took you in. Thank you. And... Mr. Im, you really are blessed! You've been chosen by Spiritual Father. What do you mean? Come to the chapel with me someday. A chapel? Spiritual Father told me to bring you someday. Okay, then. See you later. Okay. We shall be blessed! We shall be blessed! We shall be blessed! Apostle Jo. - We shall be blessed! - We shall be blessed! UNDER CONSTRUCTION Brother. Brother? Brother. Watch your head. - We shall be blessed. - We shall be blessed. Brother. - Here. - Let go! Hands off! Get your hands off me, you jerk! - Is this the police station? - Brother, I'll wash you nice and clean, so please take your clothes off. What are you? How dare you touch me? What is this place? Why are you telling me - to take my clothes off? - This is Gooseonwon. And I'm in charge of taking care of you. Understood? Are you crazy? You really are crazy. Eat this, you bastard. Okay? Are you playing with me? - You need to wash. - Back off, you jerk! Don't you dare touch me, you dirty bastard. Hey, you bastard. You never listen when someone's nice to you, huh? How dare you call me dirty? You crazy bastard. PLEASE KEEP CLEAN It feels bad if you call someone "dirty" when that someone is clean after salvation. It's quite sad. Isn't that so? Hot. We brought you here to make you new, - didn't we? - Help. What is this place? You washed your dirty body, and now it's time to wash your spirit. So you can become a new person. It's okay. Please sit down. - No, thanks. - Sit down, please. Do you feel uncomfortable, by any chance? Help me, please. That man is trying to kill me. Help me. Now, please get up and sit down. Sit. Drink it while it's still warm. If the sin is alive, your spirit dies. In other words, the sin must die so your spirit can live. What do you mean... Do not be afraid of death. Let's repent and become a new person in this place, with the Mighty New Sky. I told you to let me get out of here. Let me go, you crazy bastards! Oh, my. Spiritual Father. The tea is all spilled. Here, take it. Please... drink it. The Mighty New Sky... knows all of your sins. We shall be blessed. You must confess all of your sins... and empty them out so the new spirit can be poured into the new cup. The Mighty New Sky. Do not be afraid... and tell me. So... you can become a new person... and be clean. I'm sorry. I did so many horrible things. I... Father. Grandma told you to come eat dinner. Stop talking gibberish and go buy some alcohol. You're just like your mother, so you'll run away if you grow. Don't lie to me! You shouldn't have been born from the beginning. Whenever I see you... I feel like dying with this fire inside me, get it? Go kill yourself. What kind of father doesn't know his own son's birthday? I ordered black bean noodles. You love this, don't you? Let's go eat them. Grandma, you don't make much money selling cardboard boxes. - And you ordered black bean noodles? - It's okay. Let's go eat them. I can use all of my money for you. I feel so sorry for you. I'm sorry. Grandma, I... I love you the most in this entire world. Okay? So... don't feel sorry for me, okay? Okay. Let's go eat. Okay. Go on and eat it. Okay. Would black bean noodles be enough for your birthday? It's so delicious. Grandma, why aren't you eating? I will. Go ahead and eat. Okay. Help yourself, okay? Father. Hi. Did you eat? Yes. What about you? I'll eat after your mother does. - Give it to me. I'll do it. - Okay. Mom, you're eating so well. - It's hard, isn't it? - No, it's okay. Mom is the one who's having a hard time. Your mother is a strong woman. You can go home now. You will be busy tomorrow, too. Are you worried about me? You should be healthy to work as the governor. Right. Mom, open wide. That's right. Go on and eat. MOOJI HANGIL NURSING HOME What are you doing? What are you doing? How about a ride? Come to Haechon. GOOSEONWON Sir, you brought new members today? This is Apostle Kang Eun-sil of Gooseonwon. She's the most beautiful lady in Mooji, don't you think? Come on, you're embarrassing me. And he's the best worker in Gooseonwon. Apostle Jo Wan-tae, who's also the general affairs manager. I'm flattered, sir. - Is Spiritual Father here? - Of course. Please come up. This is heaven, isn't it? Welcome. Drink it. It tastes better when it's still warm. This isn't an ordinary tea. This tea was brewed with Water of Life blessed by the Spiritual Father. It means the "father of spirits." Pastor isn't just a clergy to us. He's more like the father of our spirits. Okay. Sir. How about a picture card game with me today? You're trying to give me pocket money again, huh? Spiritual Father. I must be on my way now. Sure. Get a lot of pocket money. Okay. Thank you. Your children's spirits are innocent and clean. What's your name? I'm Im Sang-mi. I'm Im Sang-jin. How old are you? Seventeen. They're twins. Fraternal twins. Oh, I see. They did look similar somehow. Such a blessing from the Mighty New Sky. Isn't that right, Apostle Kang? Yes. All of these are precious gifts from the Mighty New Sky. Since Spiritual Father mentioned it, I'll go to the stable tomorrow. By the way... why did you volunteer to get us a house immediately? Because he's here. This is the faith given to us by the Mighty New Sky. Love your neighbor as you love yourself. Our Spiritual Father tells us to do that all the time and he practices it himself. Okay. Then... we must be on our way now. Okay. Thank you. Honey. Are you really going to do it? Don't you want to? Well, it's not like I don't want to... But it doesn't look like an ordinary church. That bothers me. Still, they didn't seem weird. Won't it be better to have a house for the kids to go to school? Dad. Can't we just stay at the container until we save up some money then find a room? What about you, Sang-jin? I think it's okay. Really? Yeah. They seemed nice. When they prayed. He makes the blind see, and makes the crippled walk. Our powerful Mighty New Sky. Please comfort Sang-jin's ill body and soul, and cure him. We shall be blessed. Sang-mi, as fair as white jade, and as lovely as perfumed oil... shall also be blessed by the Mighty New Sky and be saved... What is that? What's going on? Apologize. If you don't apologize now, I'll call the police. Then you pay to clean my clothes. You bullied him first. Any proof? Guys, if any of you saw me bullying him, come out and tell, okay? If you move one more step, I'll smash you into pieces.
