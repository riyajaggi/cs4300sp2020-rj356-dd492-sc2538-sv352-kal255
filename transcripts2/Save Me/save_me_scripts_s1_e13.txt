 THE SHIP OF SALVATION SHALL MAKE YOU WHOLE SAVE ME It seems that my father has joined hands with that cult leader. I shall have a wedding of the New Sky in which Sang-mi and I become one. "...but you mustn't come back." Is this a warning or a threat? Who are you? She said she's an undercover journalist. -How could you just sneak in there? -We have to get out of here! -Sister Kim. -We shall be blessed! I will save all of them no matter what.

 I'm going to bring this place down no matter what. Sang-mi! It's a tranquilizer that can knock out an elephant with one shot. Mom! That woman gave my mom some kind of injection. I'll try and find out what it was. But today he finds a body! We found a wallet next to the body. Her ID card was inside. Who on Earth are you people? Are you saying that you chose me and my family because I resemble the girl you drove to death? If you keep on acting like this,

 I'm going to have to change how I do things. EPISODE 13 Try it. Scream out for someone to save you. The only person who can save you here... is... me. Are you saying... that you chose me and my family... because I resemble the girl you drove to death? If you keep on acting like this... I'm going to have to change how I do things. Please, wait! Now I understand. That you... can do what you like, whenever you like to me. So, now... I won't run away. If this is really my fate... I ask you... to just wait a little longer... until I can truly accept you. Can I... really trust you, Sang-mi? Yes. Very well. I shall wait until... the fruit is ripe. Are you feeling okay? This place is... Don't swallow any more pills Apostle Kang gives you. -What do you mean? -That way, Sang-mi can survive. Don't forget this. I think Sister Kim has woken up. Please lift her up. Do you know where this place is? The New Sky. Where my Sang-jin is. Yes, that's right. Okay, let's give you your medication now. Open wide. There we go. You must take your medication, so you don't get sick again. Well done. Take some rest now. Okay? Salvation... Eternal life... We shall be blessed. Are you okay? Yeah. You didn't look so good walking over here. I'm fine. Sorry. -It's all because of me... -Forget it. We've always been like that. Dong-chul. What are you doing over there? I just asked her something on my way back from the restroom. And what was that? She looks a similar age to me, so I asked where she went to elementary school. Future Spiritual Mother, where are you going? To see my mom. Go back in. You can't see your mother for the time being. Okay. -Dong-chul. -Yes? Please don't talk to the future Spiritual Mother like that again. Well, she looked around my age... The Spiritual Mother-to-be is a very special person at Gooseonwon. -Please be careful in the future. -Okay. By the way, why is she so special? You're such a curious boy. I always have to ask when I'm curious. Very well. She is the one who shall cleanse us all of our sins. She's currently undergoing 40 days of spiritual training, so if she talks to those who are spiritually inadequate, her soul will become disordered. So, please refrain from speaking to her like just now. Understand? Yes. I'm really sorry. VOICE MEMO You wanted to see me? If you keep on acting like this... I'm going to... have to change how I do things. This is... all proof that the end is nigh. With the impending apocalypse, do you all want to waste your life drinking alcohol like others? Or do you want to prepare for the day of salvation here? We should prepare for the day of salvation. That's right. Do you all believe that the Mighty New Sky shall save us? I believe. I believe. Okay, we'll end class here for today. All together, We shall be blessed! We shall be blessed! Well done, everyone. Okay, the van is waiting out front for you, so you may get in. Goodbye. -Dong-chul. -Yes? Could I have a word with you? -Oh, sure. -Great. -We shall be blessed. -What's the problem? I heard you had an encounter with the Spiritual Father. Oh, that. That's because I got lost. When I met him, I thought I was going to go blind. It really startled me. But I didn't go blind. That's because your spirit is pure and innocent. If you take your spiritual training seriously, you'll be granted a first-class ticket on the Ship of Salvation. So, you must do your best at training camp. Okay? Yes. But still, I'm a little hesitant. -Don't you want to get into the New Sky? -Yeah, I do. Depending on how strong your faith is, your parents, too, can board the Ship of Salvation. Are you going to let those you love fall into the pits of hell? I can't let that happen. Then when does the training camp start? You can start tomorrow. Tomorrow? Okay. Apostle Kang. I have to head back home briefly to take care of some business. What business? Well, it's my mother's birthday. You're well aware that Satan disguises himself as your family to tempt you, right? Yes. Then since you must take care of the Spiritual Mother, -make sure you're back for morning service. -Yes. We shall be blessed. Oh, my, it's so nice having lots of young people here. I wish my grandson would also come like this. Is Gyu-ho still the same? He wanted to be a soccer player back when we attended church. Don't get me started. He's been completely possessed by his computer. Oh, Mighty New Sky. I guess you ladies both attended church together before. Of course. We went to the same church for 30 years before coming here with the Spiritual Father. What does that make us again? We're living proof. I see. But after leaving your church, why did you end up coming here? Because the Spiritual Father's sermons are different from those of regular pastors. They're all jealous of his abilities, so they just made up stories about him. Like what? Such as the Spiritual Father exploiting wom-- Goodness! Have you gone senile? How can you say such wicked things? It's not good for the new believers. Well, you know how it is. People get jealous of people who do better than them. Exactly. That's what I'm saying. That's all the devil's doing. Thank you. See you. Goodbye. Are you looking for someone? A guy... He's been drinking nothing but beer for hours. Sir! One beer for me too, ma'am. What? Ma'am? Who does she think she is? She's not that much younger. Sorry, I kept you waiting, right? Who do you think you are? Bossing me around like this. Don't be like that. I only just managed to get out tonight. Found out what I asked? Here. ANALYSIS REPORT It cannot be prescribed without a doctor's consent. Taking it every day will mentally impair a healthy person. Are you saying they really give this to patients there? It's not some sort of vitamin. I'm not completely certain yet, but I don't think they were just giving it to one patient. I think it's time for you to get out of there. Request a formal interview, -then send proof to the police. -No. -Why not? -This isn't enough. They would have paid off doctors, too. Even if they're caught, they can easily get out of it. Hey, Hong So-rin. Aren't you overdoing things a bit just to get up to Seoul? It's just a feeling, but I don't think this is a simple religious-political relationship. Then what? Mooji will be turned upside down. No, the entire country could be shaken. -Enjoy, ma'am. -Sorry? She's in the Spiritual Mother's room in the main hall, second floor. And her mom is on the fifth floor of the nursing home. Something's strange about this place, too. These are all mountains here, right? No one would even know if someone died here. And if you look here... this way through the mountain is the fastest way into town. Can't we just go out the front gates? Members often walk on the front gate path, so it's too risky. Pass it here. If we can't go this way by car or bike, then I think going this way will be quickest. Hey, Dong-chul. Is Sang-mi doing well in there? Does that make any sense? How can she be doing well? Right, then should I have asked if she's not doing well, like a jerk? They keep her from meeting regular members, so I haven't had the chance to talk to her properly. But thankfully, it seems she's hanging in there. I've agreed to live there while I'm trained. Live there? Have you lost your mind? What do you mean, you'll be living there? -We're running out of time. -Dong-chul, you could really get hurt. Just tell them you're tired and come home each night. Yeah. If you go in too deep, things could get more dangerous for you. I have to try anything I can now. They're asking new members for 2000 dollars each for it. They say it's for "basic spiritual training." Wait, two grand is a lot of money. Do you even have it? All right. I'll do what I can. Anyway, Jeong-hoon did a great job today. Come on, man, it is no big deal. You're making me blush. I found out where they were before they came to Mooji. Where? Around Daegu. I'm going to head over there. I should be able to find a clue or something on what they did and who they were. Apparently, the leader used to be a pastor. -A pastor? -Yeah. A few of the members here say they came from the church he preached at. They didn't go into details, but I think he had problems with women. Right, this isn't his first time. He's a repeat offender. Did you catch the name of his church, by chance? No, they didn't say anything else. Okay. Maybe I'll find out where it was when I head over there. I heard that detective came to Gooseonwon to investigate. He talked with the leader, and even saw Sang-mi when they called her in. He didn't listen to us when we told him. Why did he suddenly change his mind? What do you think he spoke with Sang-mi about? I better look into it, too. Father, are you still asleep? Has he still not woken up? He's never slept in before. I wonder what's wrong. I told you not to let him take his meds today. Why are you blaming me? Father! Father. At least let us know that you're still in bed. Father. Father. Father. What's wrong with him? I think he's dead. The land registry documents? They're gone. It can't be. That means he gave them both our house and land deeds! Why, those con artists! I'll kill them! Stop! You mustn't! -Are you the pastor? -That's him! I saw him before. Please, try to calm down. What is the problem here? What's the problem? You con artist! My dad gave you so much money over the years! Was that not enough, so you had to take his house and land, too? And you call yourselves human? -I think there's been a misunderstanding. -There's no misunderstanding! Where is your father? He didn't come to this morning's service. I'll go and look for him. What do you mean? He passed away this morning! Please! You can't do this here! Congratulations. Your father is on the Ship of Salvation, like he always wanted. Brothers and sisters, do you believe our brother, Yoon Dal-sung, has ascended to the New Sky? I believe! Oh, my! It's the Mighty New Sky's grace! Congratulations! I need to pray harder so I can ride on the Ship of Salvation like your father! Congratulations! Do not be sad. Do not be angry. And just let him go. It was all for you. He didn't do this because he wanted to go to the New Sky alone. He loved you... more than he loved his own son. How did you know that? Honey, what is he talking about? Apostle Jo. Yes? Has Brother Yoon ever brought us his house and land deeds as an offering? Apostle Jo, please deliver this to the Spiritual Father. Yes. He said he wanted to make a special offering. Return it to them. Pardon? Our brother has made it to the New Sky. -We shall be blessed. -I believe! I believe! His special offering no longer has meaning now. But, Spiritual Father... how can you be certain that he has gone to the New Sky? Apostle Jo. Do you doubt that my word is the word... of the Mighty New Sky? Not at all. Of course, I believe. I believe. We shall be blessed! We shall be blessed! -We shall be blessed! -I believe! MOOJI CHURCH Goodness. Hello. Over there. He's been like that since morning. Please take him away. Jeez, the smell! My goodness. Excuse me, sir! Please get up. Don't just lie on the ground. I'll take you somewhere you can sleep comfortably, okay? Come on, up you get. There we go. What on Earth were you drinking? The smell. -Hello, Officer Woo. -How are you doing? Great. Thank you for your hard work at this hour. -Just a moment. -Sure. Out you get. Hey. -Where am I? -Easy, now. Easy. He's still drunk. Why are you taking me? Careful. Please take care of him, would you? Oh, don't you worry. He shall be saved, and reborn a new man. Take this. Goodness, what's this? You have to stay healthy to provide for your wife and son. Am I right? I can't keep taking gifts from you. Don't worry. Nobody knows. Nobody at all. Right. A real father pays for his son's college tuition, and buys him a house when he gets married. MOOJI POLICE STATION -What are you doing here? -I know how much hassle it is for the police to interfere with religious groups. I'm also well aware that you can't just jump to it and investigate when people come barging in and ask you to investigate something. Hey, get up. -You just said you understood. -I do, but please don't tell me to just do nothing and stay put. If it was your daughter who had been taken by a cult, would you be saying the same thing? Hey, people are staring at us because of you. Why are you doing this to me? I... do not like you, detective. I don't trust you, either. It was the same with Dong-chul three years ago. And recently when you sent Sang-mi back to that place. But now, I need you. A detective who can investigate Gooseonwon is what I really need. Look here, young master. I'm not interested in you. So, just go back. Or continue to stay here. Do what you like. When you went to Gooseonwon... why did you meet with Sang-mi? You know well that what she said wasn't the truth. -So? -I'll give you... some information you will be interested in. Quickly, you punk. Get up. Get up, young master. Okay. Come somewhere with me. What? You said okay. Let's go. What? Where? Hey. That crazy... He's out of his mind. Hey. I'm not going anywhere. -Don't you want to check the information? -Are you kidding me? How can I trust you and just follow you? Ms. Kim Hae-eun. The woman you're investigating, who died after being reported missing. Before she died, she often argued with her grandma over 2000 dollars she needed to get to the New Sky. -How do you know all that? -Mooji is much smaller than you think. There was a dead body. Of course rumors will spread. In Gooseonwon, before believers can meet the Spiritual Father, they must complete a basic spiritual-training course. The cost for that is 2000 dollars. Something about having to get into the New Sky or whatever, and begged her for 2000 dollars. How do you know so much about Gooseonwon? Let's talk on the way. Why, that little punk... It will rid your body of its toxins. You must drink it all. Those are all the rotten sins that were inside of you. Let it all out. Is this what you want? Is this what you want, Mom? This isn't what you want, it's what he wants! Mom, don't be deceived. Please. This water blessed by the Spiritual Father shall ease your stomach. Drink it. DAEGU Right. There's a real estate agency if we take a left at that intersection. Nearby there. Well? You wanna be a detective, right? -No. -Then what? A prosecutor. Don't get snarky. Me? Please, buckle up. Come on in. Sorry for intruding. This is definitely a cult. Would you mind if we recorded this conversation? Sure. Go ahead. So, it is true that this man used to work here as a pastor, right? Yes, it is. Just thinking of it... Oh, Lord. Was there anything else he did apart from embezzling church funds? It was fake. -Sorry? What was? -After a little digging, we found out that his ordainment papers were fake. He had such a way with words that he fooled all of us with his sermons. Were there ever any issues of sexual assault with female members? We came here after learning about that. So, please don't hide anything, and just tell us. Don't you agree we need to get rid of cults? Well, there was a member of the church who was quite fond of him. They... seemed to be in some kind of relationship. Isn't that right? Yes. There was a pretty deacon who worked as a nurse. Her husband would get wasted, would get blind drunk and beat her senseless. So, he would give her counseling and pray for her, which I guess led to that. Do you happen to remember that woman's name? I only remember her as Deacon Kang. -Do you remember what she looked like? -She was pretty. She had big eyes and very full lips. She looked quite cold on the outside, but she looked so nice when she smiled. How on Earth... did she get involved with a man like him? Oh, Lord. Was there a man who also went around with him? Very sharp eyes, with curly hair like a middle-aged woman. It seems you're referring to Deacon Jo. Right! He came along with the pastor when he first joined this church. I think he said they were half-brothers. He came with this large guy who couldn't speak. They were such nice people that they quickly had a grip on all of the church members. They were very influential. When I joined the church and checked the books, I found it was in piles of debt. They even took out a private loan, which says everything. Will you tell me to do nothing, even after this? Let's think about it a minute. I can't just stand by. No, I won't just stand by. My friend will broadcast everything we just heard here. Broadcast? What broadcast? What do you mean? We have a strategy, too. You said your friend is inside there, right? Yes. Then ask him to find out the name of the old person who left the church with him. What for? We need to confirm the facts. Broadcast? Give me a break. Who in Mooji would broadcast that for you? Oh, my, ma'am! That must be heavy. Please, give that to me. Goodness, thank you! You shall be blessed by the Mighty New Sky. Have some water. -Oh, my, it's hot. -Thank you. That's the stuff. So refreshing. That's because it came from the spring the Spiritual Father laid his hands and prayed on. By the way, ma'am, what is your name? My name? Why do you want to know an old woman's name like mine? Because when I look at you, it reminds me of my grandma who passed away. My name is Park Soon-nyuh. That's a beautiful name. From now on, you, too, must start praying a lot. That way, you can be reunited with your grandma in the New Sky. Okay. PARK SOON-NYUH Lie down. I checked with my senior in the press. He confirmed that your mother had been given psychoactive medication. As soon as I can obtain proof that it's not just your mother they're giving it to, neither the police nor the prosecution will be able to ignore it. So, hang in there a little more. I need to leave now. Apostle Kang wants to see me right away. So-rin. I have one more favor to ask you. Please give this note to Dong-chul. Sang-jin. Mom. There's now a ray of hope. I thought no one would listen to me. But one by one... people are starting to listen. We shall be blessed. Honey. Our Sang-mi... Don't worry. Sang-mi will soon have a wedding of the New Sky with the Spiritual Father. Honey. You don't know how thankful I am that we could come here. This was all the Mighty New Sky's Revelation. It was by the Mighty New Sky's marvelous grace that she is made into the Spiritual Mother. Isn't it just amazing? We're almost there. Sister So-rin. Yes? Did you give the Water of Life to the Spiritual Mother? Yes. Are you happy with your work? Yes, I'm so grateful to the Mighty New Sky. What did you say you used to do before joining Gooseonwon again? I was preparing to go to graduate school, but then I found my path after meeting the Mighty New Sky. I see. Very well. Get back to your duty. MOOJI DAILY COMMUNITY SERVICE CENTER -Police. -Sorry? So, this land all belonged to Park Soon-nyuh. She is no longer the owner of the land? They were due to be redeveloped, so she sold it a few years ago. Then could you please check who owns the land now? Yes, certainly. I was right. It belongs to someone else. Is it under a "Baek Jeong-gi," by any chance? No. It's under a "Jo Wan-tae." Jo Wan-tae? That'll be enough, detective. You may be a detective, but you can't continue this. This is a country where there is freedom of religion. Come to think of it, these are all under Jo Wan-tae's name. This guy hit the jackpot. Mr. Jo. Yes, it's me. A detective just came in and asked about your land. Sorry? His name is Lee Kang-soo. Yes, of course. Yes, I'm enjoying the antler juice you're sending me. I'll keep an eye on things and update you. GOOSEONWON Let me out here, then make sure you find those thugs. Okay? You have to find them no matter what. Got it? Hello, Chief Lee! Oh, my, you work endlessly to keep Mooji safe. You've been well, I assume? Of course. Hello there, Mr. Jo. The Spiritual Father has such high expectations of you. Okay. I'll organize a meeting soon. Take care. Hey, baby! Why don't you come by these days? So, you missed me? Of course I did. Hey. Well, who do we have here? Salute! I'm Prisoner 4884. Prison guard Jo Wan-tae. Hey. Are you still in the shaman scam game? It's not a scam. This time a strong spirit really entered my body. I'm guessing you were done for violence. Why speak like that to someone you just met? Scum like you think you'll be clean after getting out of prison I bet, right? Life's not that simple. You used to be a prison guard. Seems you still think this place is a prison. Who are you to come to my town and cause trouble? Come on, fellas. How cute. There's a place called Gooseonwon 20 minutes outside of town. We have a great chapel there, come by sometime. I'll make you into a clean man. You should go to heaven, after all. Heaven? Gooseonwon? Gooseonwon! That place is famous on Internet broadcasting sites. You live there, do you? Internet broadcasting? REQUESTING INFORMATION ENTER MESSAGE Okay. You want information, do you? You want to give information, right? Yes, thank you. You used to go to the church that's shown in Daegu stream earlier? So, that's how you know so much. Yes. There's more? OFFERING - MIGHTY NEW SKY, PLEASE FREE MY FAMILY FROM PAIN MIGHTY NEW SKY, PLEASE KEEP DAE-SIK HEALTHY PLEASE LET DAE-SIK ONTO THE SHIP OF SALVATION What are you doing drinking soju by itself? What is it? Did you quit? Eat something with it. It's not good for your stomach. If you're going to do this... then let's just die. What did you say? There's no one in this wretched world, that will take in someone who was expelled for fighting. That's not true. Dae-sik. There is. Gooseonwon. Have you lost your mind? For this bullshit you gave them all your money, and now a private loan? No, you've got it all wrong. Things like this weigh down our souls! Money is the devil! Please... Please stop spouting that nonsense. Every time you speak like that, I feel like I'm losing my mind! It hurts. -What is it? -Nothing. It's nothing. My goodness. -It's nothing, I tell you. -What happened? It's nothing. Did someone hit you? No, that's not it. Was it the loan sharks? No, I tell you. Then who was it? Dae-sik, I wasn't hit. It was a prayer. These aren't bruises. They're marks of sin. I have this many marks because I have sinned a lot. I said, that's not it! Dae-sik, where are you going? Dae-sik! Sup, Man-hee. I just came out to meet an informant. It's nearby our house. I'll go home tonight and head there tomorrow. I can't! If I don't go home tonight, my dad's gonna break my legs. Okay. Tell Sang-hwan for me. All right, get some sleep. I'll sort this out tonight, too. Are you the person with information? SANG-HWAN They had kept my mom on some strange medication. Hong So-rin helped her stop taking them, so she's coming back to her senses. If we find a little more evidence on these drugs, we might be able to release it to the media. And the cult leader... I'm not the first Spiritual Mother he's tried to make. I think there were issues of sexual assault before. I managed to voice-record it. If you dig into his past, you'll be able to find more. If that happens, I can tear this place down. Then maybe I will really be free from this place. You guys be careful until then. The old lady you told me about, I visited the church she used to attend. Her and her friends did follow the leader here. And also, on top of paying for a fake ordainment and embezzling church money, I think he had problems with a woman. Now this all makes sense. I think D-Day will be here soon. Wait for my message. Then with the info you've given us, we'll draw up an escape route for you. Do you finally get the picture of who it is you messed with? Who are they? What are you talking... Who are those little rats you hang around with? I think you've got the wrong idea. I roll solo. I'll be back to play soon. Okay? Goodness, you scared me. Oh, my, how startling. Dong-chul, what are you doing here? It's my first night here, so I couldn't sleep. I came out for a walk and saw you and Brother Wan-deok head off into the mountains in a hurry, so I got curious and followed. You are a very curious chap, aren't you, Dong-chul? My friends always accuse me of being nosy. Dong-chul, as I'm like an uncle to you, I'll give you some advice. Constantly going off to do things on your own isn't a good idea. But seeing you two run off quickly like that, I just got worried and wondered if I could help with something. Goodness me, look at the time. Let's head back down. Sure. By the way... -what about Brother Wan-deok? -He went down first. -Already? -Yes. What is it? I just... I think I heard a sound from there. Maybe it was a cat? Let's go. -By the way, where's Jeong-hoon? -He said he's not coming tonight. Anyway, they said this wedding of the New Sky is in 40 days, right? Has it been ten days now? Forty days. You don't think they'll bring it forward, do you? -We better hope they don't. -Does that mean they could? Once I receive the Mighty New Sky's revelation, I shall decide on a date and inform you. If he decides to say he received the New Sky's revelation, then the 40 days... could mean nothing. GOOSEONWON Sang-mi. You're doing well, right? There's not long left before the wedding of the New Sky, so clear your heart of all malevolence. And starting afresh, you must accept the Mighty New Sky and Spiritual Father with all your heart. Dad. There's something I want to ask you. What's that? When I get married to him... do I have to... sleep with him? Sang-mi. It's not "sleeping" with him. It's him baptizing you. A baptism of salvation. So, don't worry about anything. And if I refuse that baptism of salvation... what will happen to me then? Sang-mi. Why are you thinking such things? Put aside those foolish thoughts, and pray. My daughter. You can do a good job, right? So, in the end... I have to give him my everything. It's the only way to end everything for sure. Who are you? Since you laid your hands on my poor mother and made her bruise like that, -then I should really return the favor. -Hey! Are you crazy? Stop that! Sang-mi. Go outside. Dad. Don't worry. The Mighty New Sky shall protect me. Okay. Then let me see for myself... if he really is protecting you. SAVE ME Over here! I got him! Hey, what are you doing? Over here! Come quickly! There! You demons! Get him! OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
