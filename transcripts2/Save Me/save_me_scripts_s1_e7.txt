 Be careful. For goodness' sake. Ma'am, are you really this man's girlfriend? Yes, I am. Then did your boyfriend assault you? That man over there... Dong-chul, you scamp. When did you get out? Couple of days ago. After going through that, you need to straighten up and fly right. You only just got out, and you're causing trouble. I'm sorry. If you don't want to be... charged with vandalism, you'll have to pay a settlement. Okay.

 -I'm scared. Let's get out of here. -Wait. Let's check once more as we've already come this far. Jeez, have you lost it? We were almost caught! What do you plan to do? We should walk up and ring the doorbell. Who? Hey, Dong-chul. Yes? Have you met Jeong-hoon? No. Listen up. Don't take this the wrong way. Okay. Don't go and see... my son, Jeong-hoon. He has to go to university, and well... You know what I'm saying, right? Yes. I won't see him ever again. No need to worry. Goodbye. Officer Woo. -What is it? -We got a report of a fight. What is it today? I'm sorry, Dad. Please forgive me. You live here? Yes, I moved here. I thought you were staying at Guseonwon. Well, it's because of my daughter. I see. Well, yes, I suppose it's a lot more dangerous for her to live with regular people. You did the right thing. Anyhow, what brings you out here at this time? Well, it seems some lunatic made a crank call. What is your daughter doing right now? Why is my daughter involved in this? It's nothing, we just got a call about sounds of violent activity. Sorry, violent activity? She's my precious daughter. She sometimes says some strange things and screams out. That's not an easily curable illness. Is she taking medication? Yes, she just took them and went to sleep. If it's not too much, could we pop in and take a look? Hey, no need for that. Let's leave. Sorry for disturbing your peace. -It's no problem. -But, Officer Woo, we got a report. We should go in and... I told you to leave it! Let's just go. Hey, can you hear them? Not one word. I'll try voice recording. Good night. -Good night. -Bye. Let's go. Officer! We have protocol to follow! Hey, you don't know what it's like to be a parent. -She's not well. Don't disturb... -What'd they say? Move. What was that? I think they're the ones who made the crank call. -Come on! Let's go after them! -Yes. What do you think you're doing? Dad. I don't want to resent you. No, I don't want to loathe you. So, please... listen to me. -Give me that. -No. I have to get out of here, Dad. I must save Mom. Really! I need to get out of here! Give this to me! It's you, Dad... who's lost his mind. You're the one... who is ill. Sang-mi. The Spiritual Father told us. The Mighty New Sky will never allow our family to be in more pain than we can handle. Right now, the Mighty New Sky is testing us to see whether we can ride on the Ship of Salvation. How did things turn out like this? How? How did you become such a monster? We have worship at dawn. Go to sleep. It's been ages since we've done something that crazy. We won't get the chance again. We won't be able to when we grow old. I'd never have dreamt I'd be chased by my own dad's police car. Anyway... why would she be in that place? Isn't it obvious? That father of hers dragged her in there. That's my point! -Why would he take his own daughter there? -That's why it's a cult. They don't care if it's their own children. I don't know. I just don't know. If we get tangled up in this and get caught, we're dead. So, let's stop this craziness, yeah? And to be honest, why does she matter to us? She matters to me. -Just lie down. -Okay. Jeong-hoon. Give me your phone. -Why? -I saw you recording with it. See? Good thing I was streaming, right? Here. Before we see it, I don't like how you're acting. -Straighten up and thank me sincerely... -I saw a mosquito. -Cut it out. -Let's watch. Hello. Yes, Apostle Jo? -What? -Yes, it's me. -Why, that... -I'm calling because... -Turn it up. -Okay. ...I think I'm going to need CCTV cameras fitted here. This place seems to be full of evil spirits. Okay. Okay, then I'll see you at morning worship. Jeez, I don't feel good about this. My dad told me that you can't mess with religions. Sang-hwan, let's back out of this. Korea has religious freedom. What are we gonna do? If Dong-chul was here... what would he do? Sang-hwan. Are you going home tonight? No. Did you fight with your dad? Sang-hwan's not like you. Get off my bike. You're heavy. Get off. I'm going. See you tomorrow. Okay, see you. Dong-chul. Whoa, hey! -Let them separate! -Dong-chul! Seok Dong-chul! -Get off. -You okay? Dong-chul, we're friends! Get your hands off me. Get your hands off me! Seok Dong-chul! You want your leave to be canceled? You're the chief mourner. You need to watch over your grandma's ceremony. Man-hee. Stop it. Dong-chul's heart is more broken than mine. Let Dong-chul... do whatever he wants to. I know. I know you don't wanna see me. But... can't you put that aside just this once? Sang-hwan. Do you know how she passed away? In order to send me money... she went out at dawn to collect cardboard boxes... and was killed in a hit-and-run. -It's all your fault... -Dong-chul, watch... Because you wanted... to make sure your oh-so-mighty father becomes the governor... you killed... both me... and my grandma! -Dong-chul! -Get off! Dong-chul! Stop this! What are you doing right now? How did we end up like this? Stop! Dad. You're here? Little punk. Why are you out so late? Dad, did Mom get mad at you or something? Why are you here all alone? Would I let Mom get mad at me? Of course not. Okay, let's see what we have here. Chili paste, mayonnaise, Chili paste. I can see in your eyes that you want chili paste. Right? Then I'll dip this in here for you. -Here. -Why are you being so creepy? Creepy? Jeez, Dad! I'm your only son. Eat. That's too much chili paste. -Jeong-hoon. -Yes? Have a beer with me. You know you were such a difficult child to give birth to, right? But Mom gave birth to me. -I gave birth to you! Me. -Yes, okay! You gave birth to me. I departed from you, met Mom, grew up in her, and then came out. So, technically speaking, it was you. Oh, my Jeong-hoon. My boy. I live for you. -You know that? -Yes. Ouch, Dad. That hurts, Dad. Take your hand off me. From now on, don't lay your hands on me. Remember what I'm about to tell you. Even if you should regret everything and beg Mom and I for forgiveness, I can never forgive you. No... I won't ever forgive you. -We shall be blessed. -We shall be blessed. -Everything okay? -Yes, the Mighty New Sky protects us. Did you sleep well? Your mother's been waiting since dawn. Not just your mother. The Spiritual Father has also been eagerly awaiting you. Get in. You said they were waiting for me. Why, Sang-mi, you're raring to go today. Come on out, Sang-mi. You seem to be tightly tying your laces like someone who's about to run off. You head on up. I'm going to see my mom first. Then let's go together after... Don't be scared. I'm not going anywhere. Sang-mi. How dare you speak like that to Apostle Kang. Okay, sure. We still have a lot of time before the service. Go and see your mother. Spiritual Father, you called for me? I heard you had a small disturbance on the street recently. Yes. Some young men Sang-mi used to go to high school with wanted to know about her. It wasn't a big deal, so please don't worry. Apostle Im says that isn't the first time those boys have run into Sang-mi. Is that correct? Yes. We... had a minor collision in an alleyway. I think they saw Sang-mi back then. Did those boys say anything to her? They asked if she "really needed help." And that they would help her if she was in danger. Those who need to be saved are acting as if they are doing the saving. I think it was just out of youthful foolishness... Apostle Kang. -Yes? -I think the time for you to pay for the mistake you once made to the Mighty New Sky has come. From tomorrow, take Sang-mi and prepare... to welcome the New Sky's Spiritual Mother. You mean... It's time for me to have a pure spiritual wife and to get everyone onto the Ship of Salvation with the blood of atonement. I believe. We shall be blessed. We shall be saved with the blood of the lamb. We shall be saved with the blood of the lamb. Mom. No one will save us here. We shall be saved with the blood of the lamb. We shall be saved with the blood... Mom. This is all fake! It only imprisons and destroys you! So, please... Mom, don't fall apart anymore! No! No, Sang-mi! No! Do you know how important this is? We need this to live with Sang-jin in the New Sky. Isn't that right, Sang-jin? This is the New Sky, isn't it? See, Sang-mi? All of Sang-jin's pain went away when he came here. Except that... I'm now in so much pain. Sang-jin. Sang-jin, come here. Come here and lie next to me, okay? Come here. My Sang-jin is like a baby now. Sang-mi. You come here, too. Come lie next to me. Mom. Sang-jin is... I'll put my little twins to sleep. Come here. Mom. I'm going to keep knocking. Until someone hears it. I'll keep on knocking and won't stop. Then... we will leave this place. You and I will both leave this place. We shall be blessed. -We shall be blessed. -We shall be blessed. We shall be blessed. Are you on your way to harvest the fruit? Yes, Spiritual Father. Sister Park, seeing you working hard these days is such a beautiful sight. Apostle Kang. You don't mind sharing some of the Spiritual Father's love, do you? No, of course not. I shall share it with you specially. Is the love you show for me really not the love you have for the Mighty New Sky? Right. We shall be blessed. Okay. Then please get ready to leave. -Okay. -Yes. Sang-mi. Do you know what the nine fruits of the Mighty New Sky are? Love, patience, faithfulness, joy, peace, goodwill, warmth, loyalty, and moderation. One must live a life bearing these nine fruits in order to escape the pain and anguish caused by evil spirits. That's what you want to say, right? You did a fine job remembering. However, faith isn't shown with your head. It's shown through your actions. Faith isn't something created by force, either. Okay, bros! Today is Chinese food! I will eat all this food here within 60 seconds. Choi Beep Byam says, "Oh, please, that's nonsense." You're nonsense. Okay, okay. Okay, then, if I can't do it, I'll give you all KRW 100,000, okay? Each of you KRW 100,000. Yeah? Okay. Set the timer for 60 seconds. Okay, here we go. Let's begin. Keep watching. Okay... Start! Finished! Time for the black bean noodles. I'll finish these even quicker. You can't mess around with food. What the... And it's okay to mess around with a human being? I was eating... Seriously. It wasn't... I failed this because of you! You have to pay them KRW 100,000! Bros, this doesn't count. Someone messed it up. He's been my friend for ten years, -but I don't understand him sometimes. -Hello, sir. You're still doing that stupid thing? -Have you memorized them? Let's go. -Yeah. -How are you? -I'm fine, thank you. -And you? -Okay. Give me a break. You better go to university this year. -Got it? -Dad, don't you have faith in me? -"Believe." -It means, "have faith." Dad. I need to buy a book. That's what Seoul kids study with these days. Right? How much? -Well, around... -KRW 20,000. If you cause trouble like Dong-chul... Dad. Did you see Dong-chul? Sir, do you know where Dong-chul is? Well... What is it? Oh, hey. What's up? Man-hee, what is it? What should we do about Dong-chul? What about Dong-chul? Apparently, he's working at a nightclub. As I won, you're paying for the Internet cafe, yeah? What are you talking about? That last one was only two points. What? That was three points! You blind? I have twenty-twenty vision. That so? And what do you plan on doing with such great eyesight? I'm gonna be a cop. A cop? I'll become a cop, then find my mom... and make it so my grandma doesn't have to work anymore. What a good boy you are. Yeah, you go for it. Hey, stand tall. Stand tall yourself, fool. Dude, I'm already standing tall. You stand tall. All right, let's stand tall together. What are you talking about? I'm tired. Dong-chul, you there? It's me, Sang-hwan! We open at 9. Is Dong-chul here? He's trying to keep his head down. Don't mess that up. -What? -Hey... do you know what prison's like? The thing you miss the most in there isn't black bean noodles or fried chicken. It's people. Whether it's someone you loathe, or someone you're crazy about. People is what you miss the most. -What do you think you know? -Look. This ain't the big city. You think you wouldn't be able to find him in a small town like this? It's not that you couldn't find him. It's that you've been avoiding him. You got that? Please sign. Where should I sign? LIGHTNING FAST DELIVERY POOL HALL -We shall be blessed. -We shall be blessed. -We shall be blessed. -We shall be blessed. -Let me join you ladies. -Goodness, why? -You go on in, Spiritual Father. -Right. We shall take care of all of this! "For whoever exalts himself shall be humbled, and those who humble themselves shall be exalted." All of you worshiping from a low place shall be those most blessed on the Ship of Salvation. I believe. We shall be blessed. Right, let's do this together. Your hands will get dirty. You should wear gloves. I'm fine. Spiritual Father. My Jeong-gu's doing well up there, right? Of course. During morning prayer today, the Mighty New Sky showed me through a video, clear like a movie. Jeong-gu is frolicking about by the Mighty New Sky's side. Goodness, that's so good to hear! We shall be blessed. Therefore, you must also pray hard so that you can go to the New Sky, where Jeong-gu is. Of course, I shall! I'll surely ride the Ship of Salvation and go to see my Jeong-gu. Sang-mi, you, too, must go and meet your brother. Lies. I saw it. I saw it, clear as day. Ma'am. Jeong-gu... didn't go to the New Sky... She is the devil! The devil! Ma'am... My Jeong-gu has gone to the New Sky. He's on the Ship of Salvation, happy and waiting for me. How can you say such a thing? You damned demon! May you be struck by lightning! She's right, Spiritual Father. We've been too nice to Sang-mi, which must have let the devil inside her! Sang-mi, what's wrong with you? How could you, to our glorious Spiritual... My beloved sisters. Please do not deem Sang-mi's doubt a sin. I do not condemn her doubt. Let us pray. Pray to have faith as pure and as innocent as Sang-mi's. That this young lamb can come to love the Mighty New Sky and completely accept him. Let us bless her. We bless her. We love you. We bless you. We love you. We shall be blessed. We love you. We love you. We love you. Sir, someone called "Weasel" is calling. -What is it? -Hello, sir. What are you doing today? -Why? -We have new girls in. I want to introduce them to you. Why, you... You call for something like that while I'm working? Sorry, sir. Since it's been a while since we've had ones this fine, you're the first person I thought to call. I guess I got a bit overexcited. I'm terribly sorry. Then let's grab something to eat as I haven't seen you in a while. Yes, sir! I'll be awaiting your call! Noisy little... Lee Kang-soo. You ain't dead yet. Do you remember, Mom? You used to cut our fingernails for us when we were young. Then before you knew it, Sang-jin and I would be fast asleep. Now it's me who's cutting your nails. Sang-mi. The Spiritual Father wants you. Stop that and let's go. Once I've finished. Sang-mi, you can't make the Spiritual Father wait. I'm nearly done. So, just for a moment... please let me do this. Why have you called us here at this hour, Spiritual Father? Everybody, please take a seat. Sang-mi. Do you remember when you first came here? To me, you were a young lamb... in agonizing pain. You feel guilty that... your brother might not have been so ill if it wasn't for you. What do you think you know? -Who do you think you are? -Sang-mi! The Mighty New Sky said never to ignore the pain of one's family, brothers, and neighbors. So, do you think that being a shepherd, I could ignore and not give love to one of my young lambs? Spiritual Father, I believe. We shall be blessed. Don't lie to me. I don't believe you. You... are not a shepherd, but the devil. Sang-mi! How can you utter such nasty words? That's why before it becomes too late... I'm going to save you, Sang-mi. Sorry, Spiritual Father... -What do you mean? -It's finally happening. Sang-mi is becoming the Spiritual Mother. Congratulations. Thank you. Yes, Sang-mi. Becoming the Spiritual Mother is the greatest blessing in Gooseonwon. Thank you. -You're all crazy. -Sang-mi. Dad. Do you really have no idea what this means? Sang-mi. Please, become obedient through faith. Sang-mi. Stay away. -Sang-mi. -Sang-mi. You're an adult now. You can't act like a child. Don't! No, Sang-mi! Put that down! I said, don't come near me! Calm down, Sang-mi. If I have to do as you want... -I'm going to kill myself right here. -Sang-mi. Yoo-ra, wake up! Yoo-ra! Yoo-ra, wake up! Yoo-ra, wake up! Please wake up! Yoo-ra! Stop! Don't do this, Sang-mi. You can't do this. You can't reach salvation if you do. Salvation? What even is the so-called "salvation" you people talk of? In the end, you're just going to give me to him! Sometimes... the Mighty New Sky's will can't be comprehended by human minds. However, I know. Through obedient faith, the Mighty New Sky... is going to grant us eternal salvation. Put it down. Sang-mi. I'm not asking you... to give yourself to me for my secular intentions. I only want you... to give your heart to the Mighty New Sky. Do you still not know how much the Mighty New Sky and I... love you? No! Are you really... not afraid of death, Sang-mi? It's you, who screams about salvation and eternal life that should be afraid of death. But I... am not afraid. Honey. Mom. People seek salvation and eternal life... because they are afraid of death. If you believe in and follow what I say... you shall ride on the Ship of Salvation. I believe. But if you do not believe, and do not follow my words... that which you treasure the most... I shall... take away. Indeed, Sang-mi is such a good daughter. She worries so deeply for her mother. Of course she does. My daughter has never once disappointed her parents. Well done. You did so well. If you start becoming more obedient little by little, there's no doubt the Mighty New Sky will enlighten you. Well done. What is it, Sang-mi? Is something wrong? Mom. Pray with me. If we pray to the Spiritual Father, our whole family can go to the New Sky. Mom... Sang-jin, get in here. Come and say hello to the Spiritual Father. Come on in, quickly. We all have to ride the Ship of Salvation together. Get in here. Hurry. Quickly, now. You gotta treat him well tonight. This guy is a big deal. He's a detective here in Mooji... Hello, sir! Welcome. What is it that you had to call a busy man like me out? Sir, you're going to upset me. I just wanted to see you, is all. Do I need a reason for that? What are they? Don't stand there! Go and greet him. This man's come all the way down from Seoul for the sake of Mooji Violent Crimes Division's development. Let me introduce you to the legendary Chief Lee Kang-soo! Why are you making me feel pressured here? Don't be like that. These two also got here from Seoul yesterday. Gangnam. You know those classy escort bars? Give me a break. Hey. Did you two get fired by your old boss -for taking illicit kickbacks? -Of course not, honey. Don't you lie. It's written all over your face. This place, Mooji... It's a peculiar place. On the surface it looks so peaceful. But as you peer into it, you get this foul stench that starts to creep in. Hearing you speak like that, you sound like some sort of movie director. You're sharp! Yeah. This may be the middle of nowhere, but there are lots of rich guys here, so there's plenty for you to earn. Let's go sing. Hey. You know what this is? It's life. It's all twisted up. Look. This is your life. This is yours. This is mine. And this... This shouldn't be happening. We agreed to do military service together. Don't feel too down. I'm sure Dong-chul knows how you feel. You two never had to speak to know what's up. Like twins. What do you mean, "Make the delivery"? We're going to need more manpower then, no? Hello? Typical. Hung up again. What are you guys doing here? -Why? -"Why"? I saw Dong-chul at the bull stadium a little while ago. -The stadium? -You punks. You're not kids. If you had a fight, go and make up already. It will last a long time if you don't resolve it now. Hello? Yes. Man-hee. I'll be back. You gonna be okay? I've... got something to say to Dong-chul. -Yeah, okay. Let's go. -Lie down and sleep. -You mind if I do? -It's fine. Okay. I'll get some shut-eye. Hey! Seok Dong-chul! Stand tall! You fool. Sang-jin. What is it? Why are you doing that? Mom. You try talking to him. He keeps saying strange things. What's he saying? He keeps saying... that we shouldn't stay here. Mom. Really? Did he really say that? Dong-chul. You say my name once more, -and you're dead. -Seok Dong-chul. I told you not to say it. Dong-chul. Fine. Hit me some more. If this is what it takes to fix all this, then keep hitting me. Is that all you got? I asked if that's all you got! Fine, let's do this. You little... I told you... to never come and see me again. So, why... Why do you keep coming? Because you're my friend! Because the stupid Seok Dong-chul... You... are my best friend. I won't run anymore. Now, with my own strength... I will save you. That's what Sang-jin would want, too. The sky. It's been ages. We haven't fought this hard since third year of middle school, right? -Don't come looking for me again. -Why not? Looking at you... is too tough. I saw Sang-mi. Right now... I think she's in danger. I met her... by coincidence after three years. She asked me... to save her. And this time... I... won't run. SAVE ME Mom. There was a girl I used to like. I fell for her at first sight. But when she... asked me for help... do you know what I did? I ran away. I keep... worrying about her.
