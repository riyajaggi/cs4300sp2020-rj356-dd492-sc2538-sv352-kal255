 Don't worry. The Mighty New Sky shall protect me. Okay. Then let me see for myself... if he really is protecting you. Take the Mother and go! -Let's go! -Now! Hurry. What the... What are you doing here? Are you with them, too? Hurry, Sang-mi! Listen to me very carefully. I'm not with them. I want to kill everyone here. What? Then why are you trying to stop me? You once told me!

 You want to make tons of cash to live in an apartment with your mom. I am going to... destroy this place at all costs. So, please trust me and get out of here. What's going on? Hey, you gotta hit me. Dae-sik! What's going on? Hurry! My goodness! Dong-chul! Are you okay? Dong-chul, are you okay? Well, now, Dong-chul. I'm okay. Dong-chul. I thought you were a pushover, but it turns out you're a man. I don't know. Out of nowhere, I thought -that I must protect the Mother. -Why did you think something like that? Because I learned the Spiritual Mother will cleanse us of our sins. Was I wrong? You truly do have a pure soul. The Mighty New Sky will have great use of you in the future. How was the meeting with Chief Kim? Give me some of this first. The police force is an organization. And I'm a member of it. So, have you called me here to tell me you can't investigate? Apart from the rumors of embezzlement and sexual assault, as you know, we still have nothing conclusive. -The police need evidence. -Evidence? But we recorded the pastor's testimony earlier. Just search for the account books and fake ordainment certificate. We can bring him down for forgery, fraud, and embezzlement. Once onto investigation, we can find the sexual assault victim. By the way, mister, I heard you were the best of the best from Seoul. Are you sure that's true? It's detective, not mister. Anyway, who's that friend of yours in there? -You don't need to know. -Why are you hiding it? You think I'll try to sabotage them? Because it could put my friend at risk. Dong-chul, please return to your quarters. Okay. We shall be blessed. Good work. Our offerings have decreased as of late. If we hit financial rock bottom, everyone here will have to return to the evil outside world. Pay this extra attention, -Ap. Kang. -How are you proposing I do that? Well, we can hold a New Sky revival assembly. Do you think a New Sky revival is some market store that I can just open and close at any time? Come on, don't be so cranky. It's your greed that even brought the police here. You're trying to blame an innocent man. Why was that my fault? I've also received salvation. We both know that salvation isn't what you wanted here. What you want is money. You think I don't know that? Look, I take care of housekeeping here. -I need to pay attention to money. -You've taken enough, so please just leave now. From now on, Father and I shall lead this place. It seems you're trying to bite the hand that feeds you. Kang Eun-sil, have you forgotten everything? Because I haven't. Stop luring demons in here with your pretend faith, and leave this place at once! Your husband, the man you killed, I sorted it so you never saw the inside of a cell, yet now, you're telling me to leave? It wasn't you. The Mighty New Sky helped me. You were merely a vessel in which the Mighty New Sky carried out his plan. I cleaned up your filthy mess. Now you're saying that wasn't me? So, I guess that's why you held your head so high in front of me. Do you know why I humor you people? Because I'm scared of you? You and Baek Jeong-gi are just money trees to me. I have to play along with you to keep you happy, so you bring in money from those people. Let go of me... You demon! Let go... Eun-shil, do you understand now? Who here is real. Mighty New Sky. I've given everything to you. My daughter, my family, my livelihood... and my life, too. So, please, Mighty New Sky... do not forsake me. GOOSEONWON NURSING HOME Hello. I'm Sang-mi's friend. You're Sang-mi's friend? Yes. Where's Sang-mi? Sang-mi tells you... not to worry about her. And... that she's doing okay. She asked me to tell you, "Hang in there a little longer." My baby... I need to go and see her for myself. You can't now. I have to go to her and protect her. I know it's tough, but you have to stay calm. You've been drugged up all this time. Only recently became yourself again. You can't protect Sang-mi yet. For now, until your body recovers, you must keep up your act. That way, you can fool these people. Okay. Then I better get going. I'm not supposed to be in here for long. Just a moment. Please... give this to Sang-mi. Tell her... that I'm sorry, and that I love her. You will get to... be able to get out of here. So... hold on a little longer. I will. DIRECTOR'S OFFICE GOOSEONWON NURSING HOME MEDICAL RECORDS IM SANG-MI SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION, SLEEPING DISORDER, AND SOCIOPHOBIA What is this? Why is Sang-mi a patient here? Mighty New Sky, who saved me with the blood of the lamb. I believe in you. Protect me from the temptation of Satan. Help me live obediently -through pain and hardship. -You're just money trees to me. It's my mother's birthday. MOOJI DAILY I found the medical records. They've listed every member here as patients. What do you think they're planning? By creating fake patients and prescriptions, they've illegally obtained psychoactive drugs. They've then forcefully administered large doses of drugs to your mother and others. By increasing patient numbers, they would've tried to raise the nursing home's grade or collect subsidies. Look at this. It has Baek Jeong-gi's signature on top of the director's. It means they systematically all took part. The thing is... do you think the police will investigate? Mooji police? No. I know someone at a TV station in Seoul. I'll head there, see if I can get them to make this go national. Then the police and the prosecution here -can't turn a blind eye to it. -At any rate... I don't think we have much more time left. I'll head up to Seoul now and return with more help. Thank you. Don't be. You made it this far because you're strong. Here. Your mom says she's fine, and wanted me to give this to you. Wait! Sister Hong. Where do you keep going these days? Sorry? My mom's sick. Ap. Kang wants to see you. -Quickly! -Okay. We've brought her, Ap. Kang. Apostle Kang, what is this about? The day before yesterday... where did you say you had to go? I told you that I went back home for my mother's birthday. Since when did demons start swarming this place? I should've made sure they never got here in the first place. What did I say happens when you lie before the Mighty New Sky? I found out that you weren't a student... but a journalist. For the Mooji Daily local news. Apostle... Kang, if you'd let me explain... -Did you come here to get close to Sang-mi? -That's not it. There's been a misunderstanding. Disgusting. You're so disgusting, I can't stand you! How could you be so brazen before the Mighty New Sky? Put her inside. Apostle Kang! Who else is there? Who are the other demons here to destroy Gooseonwon like you are? I'm going to weed them all out. Today is a joyous occasion, where our Spiritual Mother-to-be shall show us and her mother the faith she has awakened to through her spiritual training. From now on, the Mighty New Sky's Spiritual Mother must be able to speak the language of the New Sky in front of our believers. If Sang-mi has faithfully devoted herself to Apostle Kang's Spiritual Mother training, then I believe the Mighty New Sky... shall permit her to speak the language of the New Sky. I believe! We shall be blessed! Honey, watch and see. See how strong our daughter's faith has become. My savior. Oh, Mighty New Sky, my life. I believe in you. You called my family to this place... and let me meet the Spiritual Father. And Sang-jin... The hardship... you placed upon Sang-jin and my mother, I believe it was all part of the plan to make me the Mother. I... believe. Spiritual Father! Feed her one pill each day. GOOSEONWON NURSING HOME MEDICAL RECORDS It seems we will have to test whether our future Mother can really become the Spiritual Mother. Very well. Why has Jeong-hoon been out of reach and not come by? He said he was going home. Was he caught by his dad? Coming. Jeez, it's hot. This room is nice and cool. Does Jeong-hoon attend church these day? He's the last person I'd expect. Pil-soo, what did you just say? Well, yesterday, I saw him in some church van going somewhere. -A van? -Yeah. Did that van... have "Gooseonwon" written on it? "Gooseonwon"? "Accompany us on this happy journey to the New Sky." That goes for you guys, too. That curly-haired guy is looking all over for you. It's them. Hey, Sang-hwan. -What are we gonna do? -I was right? Wow, I've got such a great memory! See you. I think they've caught Jeong-hoon. Find out where they're keeping him. Why so startled? I wasn't. See you, then. See you. You know, I used to be a pro at finding secretly stashed objects. Turns out he's pretty good, too. Dong-chul. Really? Okay. Let's go. These people are not human. Wait a minute. Hey, Sang-hwan! Can't you drive? -We need to borrow your car. -What? -Now! -Thanks. What is it this time? For goodness' sake. I can't believe you two. I'm not a car rental shop. Thanks. Seriously. What on Earth are they doing? Go grab the tools. You ready? Yeah. I'll be back soon. See... I do all the dirty work for the sake of Gooseonwon. But instead of being grateful, she wants to kick me out? People don't bite the hand that feeds them. Animals do. Animals, I tell you. Jeez. My back. Hey, Wan-deok! That will do. Bury it. Oh, this... That's right. Goodness, I'm hungry. Let's go for some blood-sausage soup. I'm famished. From here, go this way... then take a left. It's creepy being here at night. You nervous? Let's go. Do you know who this is? Yes. It's my right-hand helper. No. She is not the right-hand helper you know. She is a demon intent on destroying your soul. Sang-mi, were you... lured in by her? No. You must speak the truth in front of the Spiritual Father. Do you understand? Yes. What has she been... telling you all this time? She didn't tell me anything. She only delivered messages from Apostle Kang. Were you aware that she was a journalist... being controlled by the devil? No. We must weed out every single demon inside Gooseonwon's walls. I believe. If you really... were not lured in by this girl... then please... perform the prayer to rid her of the devil. Please help me. I'm innocent. Do not fall for Satan's tricks. Satan always uses... a kind and pitiful face... as a way to weaken our hearts. Sang-mi, hurry up and get rid of the demon. You can do it. You prayed passionately to the Mighty New Sky earlier. Right? Sang-mi. Run away from here. Quickly. You've seen it now, right? Just how many demons are lurking here. Sang-mi, do it! Your mother also wants you to... You filthy... Demon! Be gone. No... I'm not a demon. With the fire of the Mighty New Sky! With the scorching fire! This filthy demon... shall leave this body! You can't come in here. It's just that I saw some strange-looking people sneaking inside. What people? They looked a similar age to me. There was a tall guy and a fat guy, too. I think they were headed to the storage facility in the forest. -We have to hurry. -Pardon? They're here. Who are "they"? The ones who kidnapped Sang-mi. -Where are they? -The mountain prayer room. Follow me, quickly! Jeong-hoon! Woo Jeong-hoon. Jeong-hoon! Is he in here? Jeong-hoon. Move. Jeong-hoon! Jeong-hoon. Are you okay? -Let's move, quickly! -Wait. Let's go this way. What the... There they are. There we go. You okay? Over here! I got them! Hey, what are you doing? Just hit me now. Over here! Come quickly! You demons! Get them! Get them! Go get them! Stop! Jeong-hoon, are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine. If we don't do anything, those people will destroy everyone in Mooji. I'm really grateful that... I have you guys. By the way, Brother Dong-chul, how did you say you came to see those young men? Well, I was on my way to the prayer room in the forest, when these strange-looking guys passed by. I thought it could be them. You did a great thing. Very impressive. No, not at all. It would have been quite dark in the forest. How did you get the idea it was those boys straight away? I heard their voices. They said something about having to get someone out. "Careful." "This is a cult," -is what I heard them saying. -They're pretending to be real -when they're the fake ones. -If we are not to be blinded by them, we must pray -and worship every day. -We shall be blessed. -I believe. -We shall be blessed. Today, the Mighty New Sky has sent us a most precious soul. Gooseonwon's... Holy Gatekeeper. Oh, really? Congratulations. You have been vested a sacred duty. Pardon? Thank you. Okay, Apostle Im, please take the Spiritual Mother and go. Apostle Kang and Brother Dong-chul, please prepare for the night service. Yes, Spiritual Father. Just a moment. What is it? The Mighty New Sky just showed me a revelation. It says not to send away our brother who fought with the demons. -We shall be blessed. -We shall be blessed. Dad. -The Water of Life, please. -Yes, sure. Hong... So... rin. Do your best. Sure. -We shall be blessed. -We shall be blessed. Let's go. Why didn't you tell me? Why did you do something needless and bring those demons into Gooseonwon? You're asking me why? Don't ask me. Ask the Mighty New Sky yourself. What's that supposed to mean? I'm saying, this is all because of you. They're digging into your past and broadcasting it on the Internet. This will make things complicated. Maybe it's time to pack up and leave. It's been 4 or 5 years in this small town. We've taken enough from it. Those punks are doing this because of Sang-mi anyway. So, how about we let her go and quietly disappear? The police are also involved, so more headaches could arise in the future. There is not long left before the wedding of the New Sky to make Sang-mi into the Spiritual Mother. Until then, do not cause any more problems. Have you really lost it? If you want to mess around with her, then do it today! And also, why are you obsessed with Sang-mi? If you need a woman, just ask me. From the believers here, I can... What Ap. Kang said... wasn't wrong, it seems. She said that demons had started to swarm this place at some point. Are you referring to me? A child who has lost his faith, is no child of the Mighty New Sky. Apostle Jo. I want you... to leave. What? Me treating you like the Spiritual Father has gone to your head, hasn't it? Listen here, you lunatic. You have eight criminal convictions, Prisoner No. 6100. That's who you really are, you crazy fool. Have you forgotten how you used to crawl like a dog in front of me? Do it. Hit me. If you hit me, do you think you will get everything you want? The criminal you knew in the past... is already dead. I am... the Spiritual Father, who shall guide you... to the New Sky. Do you understand? Don't be shaken by today's events, and pray harder. Dad. Yes? Please let me see Mom. I can't. They said you can't meet her during your training. The Mighty New Sky showed me a revelation. What? Are you serious? Yes. The Mighty New Sky appeared in my dream last night. He said I must pray for her myself. That way, she will be free from her illness, and I can become the Spiritual Mother. Excuse me, Apostle Kang. What is it? I need to use the restroom. Must be because I'm relaxed now, my stomach hurts. Apostle Kang. You need to lead the hymn of salvation. Shall I tell them to keep praying a little more if you're busy? No. Use the restroom. Thank you. Let's go. I'm telling you, they abducted and abused him! -Is it true? -Can't you tell? Take him to a hospital. What should I do? They could be looking for us there. We're going downtown. But first, I've a favor to ask. They abduct people, lock them up, and beat them to death. I need to get my friends out of there as soon as possible. Please let the cops know. I told you before. You guys are still too young to understand, but-- -Stop blaming others! Can you please try? -What? "We don't have proof. The police is an organization. We can't touch religious groups." Come on, you even found a body! When do you plan to take action? You guys are a real pain. To get the chief to take action, we need to meet with the governor. No one can do anything in this town without the go-ahead from your father. We'll take him to a hospital for a medical report for now. We're going to stick assault, abduction, confinement to them and press charges. If it attracts media attention, not even my father will be able to stop it. That's what I plan to do. So, detective, please do it. This will be a big case once the media takes interest. If you help, I'm sure it will also be a huge result for your career. Fine. I should move back to Seoul anyway. Let's ruffle some feathers at Gooseonwon. -I tell you, I'm so sick of this place. -We'll be going. -Man-hee. -Yeah? Please take Jeong-hoon to the hospital. I'm going to meet my father one last time. Sang-hwan. What are you planning to do with your dad? If he insists on trying to stop the investigation, I'll have to press charges against him. A son pressing charges against his father should grab the attention of the media and the public. Dong-chul, Jeong-hoon is safe. Whatever happens, I'm going in with the police tomorrow. You and Sang-mi just hang in there until then. Sang-mi! Sang-mi. Honey. Sang-mi is here... to pray for you. To... pray? Mom. Don't worry about anything. Then... this place is the New Sky. Yes. This is... the New Sky. Oh, no, what's this? This is precious Water of Life. Please be careful. Sorry. Could you go and get me some more Water of Life? Okay, then. I'll be back soon. Honey, stay with Sang... I mean, stay here with the Spiritual Mother. Okay? Sang-mi. Are you really okay? Yes. I'm fine. It's hard, right? I'm sorry. If only I'd come to my senses sooner... Don't speak like that. It's not your fault. It's now time to bring down the people who made you like this. So... I need you to hold on a little longer. Okay? What are you going to do all alone? Mom... I'm not alone. I have friends helping me. And... I'm not weak. I'm your daughter, after all. I'm strong like you. So... don't worry. Dad. Yes? I need to use the restroom. Sure, okay. I'll be waiting outside. Is that you, Dong-chul? Yeah, it's me. They brought that journalist here, but I'm not sure where they went. Can you think of a place they might be? I think I might know. There's an underground ward of the nursing home. The problem patients are confined there. Okay. I'll head over there. Jeez, there are so many flies on here. Hey, don't brush them at me! Okay, bros, let me tell you where I am. Remember the video of the cult that shocked, scared, and thrilled you? Well, tonight, I'm right back there. Look here. The name is Gooseonwon. Everything around me here feels so eerie. It's totally creepy and... That car there is... Is that a police car? Okay, bros. I better hide myself. Okay. A car is coming down. The police car and that car there have stopped close to each other. Let's see what happens. -Hi, Officer Woo. -How are you doing? Great. Thank you for your hard work at this hour. Yes. DEER ANTLER EXTRACT Goodness, what's this? You have to stay healthy to provide for your wife and son. Am I right? I can't keep taking gifts from you. Don't worry. Nobody knows. Nobody at all. How dare you! Goodness me. My, Officer Choi, you've grown a lot! Have you run away from home? -Father. -What? When are you coming home? How about you come home. -Do you love your friends that much? -I'm going home tonight. Why did you call? Because I miss you. He says he misses me. You're a man. That's gross. Spend that time missing me studying hard instead. That's how you be a good son. Got it? Woo Jeong-hoon. Yeah. That little rascal. Jeong-hoon. Let's go to the hospital now. Yeah. Let's go. I bet you want to tell me this place is a lie. But this place is real. That's how I'm going to make it. When you... are injected with this... you will also believe this place is the New Sky. So, don't you worry. What are you doing here? What are you doing? Are you okay? If you cross that mountain, you'll find a stream with a small bridge. Meet my friend there and get his help. I'll call him now. His name is Han Sang-hwan. What about you and Sang-mi? We're going to get everyone out of here. So, you need to go, tell people what's going on. Okay. Watch yourself. I promise I'll be back. Sure. Hey, Dong-chul. Is Jeong-hoon okay? Yeah. Man-hee just took him to hospital, so he'll be fine. What about you two? We're fine, too. But, Sang-hwan, you need to get over to the Mooji stream. The Mooji stream? The journalist here escaped and is heading there. You should take her and hide her at Eun-sung's place. Okay. I'm on my way. And, Dong-chul. -Yeah? -Tomorrow, I'm going in with the police. This time we have Jeong-hoon as evidence, so they won't be able to get out of it. -Just keep holding out for tonight. -Okay. You watch yourself, too. Okay. See you tomorrow. It seems the Mighty New Sky really loves me. How funny running into you here. Don't you agree, journalist Hong So-rin? Hello? Sang... hwan. Mom? It's... Mom... SAVE ME Mom! Mom. Mom. Mom, did you move by yourself? Mom... Your father... He...
