 I work for Jin-seok. He's the hand that feeds me. Everyone sins in their lives. However, not everyone repents their sins. If a sinner does not repent their sins, they will face the judgment of the Mighty New Sky. I believe. We shall be blessed! Why did she leave? What's going on? Sang-mi. Come this way. Everybody.

 Please, give a round of applause to Sang-mi, who has returned to Gooseonwon. Spiritual Father. I'm so sorry. Sang-mi. Why have you returned? From what I hear, you chose to come back to Gooseonwon yourself. I believe. Do you think I came back... because I wanted to? I told you I didn't want to. You call this grace and salvation when it's against someone's will? The real demon here... is you. I came back to protect my mom from you! It seems you are mistaken about something, Sang-mi. The feeling of resistance you have against us here... is the devil trying to manipulate you. I believe. The devil this, the devil that. Give it a rest! Wake up, everyone. You gave him your houses, money, and land. Everything! Just to work here. What part of that is salvation? It doesn't matter how much you pray here. It's pointless. Go home and see your families. See how frustrated they are because of you! Leave this place. Don't be fooled and leave this place! All of you! Take a look. This is the devil right here! Spiritual Father, I believe! I can no longer... just stand and watch as Sang-mi's soul dies. I think it is now time for us at Gooseonwon to unite... and pray with all our might. Stop talking nonsense. You're insane! The Sang-mi now is no longer the pure soul we once knew. Yes, you are right! She is not the daughter I once knew. She may look like Sang-mi on the surface, but her soul has been taken by the devil. Mighty New Sky. I beg you. Please save my daughter! Do not worry. Sang-mi will... win this spiritual fight no matter what. I believe! You're right. I will never be defeated by you. That's right. A while ago, Apostle Kang's daughter... also said the same thing as Sang-mi. This is how marvelous the Mighty New Sky's plans are. I wondered why the Mighty New Sky inflicted such pain on Apostle Kang. It was to train her so that she could make Sang-mi into our Spiritual Mother! Don't you agree? I do. This time, without fail... I shall make Sang-mi into the Spiritual Mother. I believe! I command you in the holy name of the Mighty New Sky... Spiritual Father! Wicked Satan! Leave my beloved child's body this instant! I believe! Let us all unite and pray! Filthy Satan! Leave her body at once! Can't you just leave the ledger here and go? Will you leave if I tell you to? Joon-gu. Can't we just let him go? You know him? What did I tell you back in prison? I told you not to trust anyone. You'll just get stabbed in the back again. Look! See what he tried? You're no different! You'll also do anything for a price! If you bare your teeth to me, I'll smash them all. Jeez, Jeong-hoon! Oh, Dad. It's not what you think. What did I tell you? Don't cause trouble, just study hard and go to college! Yes, Dad. Ouch, Dad! You're killing me. I'm so angry because of you! You little... -Wait. -You should stop that. Chief Lee. We're both police officers. I'm so ashamed. Yes, right. We're both police officers. Everybody! Strike with all your force! That way, Satan will scream and run away! We shall be blessed! We shall be blessed! We shall be blessed! We shall be blessed! We shall be blessed! We shall be blessed! No! Sang-mi! Don't hit Sang-mi! Don't hit Sang-mi! I'm sorry. I'm begging you. Please don't hit her! Mom. Honey, help her. Please help our daughter. It appears the devil attached to Sang-mi has now latched onto Sang-mi's mother. Wicked Satan! Please stop tormenting my family! In the name of the Mighty New Sky, leave her! Mom! Have you lost your mind? What do you think you're doing? You took my son from me! Now you want my daughter and wife? Leave! Leave! -Dad! -Leave! -No! -Leave! -Stop! -Leave! We shall be blessed. I believe! We shall be blessed! I believe! We shall be blessed! I believe! So, her father is strongly pushing for them to be punished. Chief Lee. Hello. Why, it's the governor's aide. Hello. Let's talk for a moment. The governor's son brought his friend here who had fallen into a cult. Her father reported her kidnapped so doing things by the book will be difficult. However, I'll wrap things up so they don't impact the governor. It almost sounds as if you're hoping for something in return. What? You've got the wrong idea. Also, the business you spoke of about Mr. Cheon, I'll take care of it tomorrow morning once I get the warrant. Please tell the governor not to worry about a thing. Are you a criminal? Why are you getting in the back? Dad. My friend said she was in danger. How could I ignore that? I was trying to do something good, Dad. -Come on, Dad. -Stop it. Stop! Just ignore it. You just need to study hard and get into college. That's something good. Got it? Dad. Today... you shall repent your filthy sins here and cleanse yourself. You... will never be saved here. Im Sang-mi. You must become the Spiritual Mother, then Sang-jin and your mother our whole family, can ride on the Ship of Salvation. So, please, Sang-mi. Wake up and gaze upon this marvelous truth! No one wants for Sang-jin to be saved as much as I do. But this isn't the place. You're only getting fooled by their dirty lies. Apostle Kang. Is everything okay? Has something been worrying you lately? How nice of you to be concerned about me. Thank you, but I'm fine, so you don't need to worry. Come on, how can I not worry? It is you, after all. The top propagator of our religion here at Gooseonwon. Apostle Jo, do you have the conviction to receive salvation? -Sorry? -In my opinion, it seems that you have the conviction for something other than salvation. Oh, my, Apostle Kang. That was quite an attack there. Your role here is to help the Spiritual Father grow the faith of our believers, but mine is to deal with business to make sure that everything at Gooseonwon runs smoothly. Don't denounce me like that just because I don't bring in people like you do. Okay. Then from now on, let's try not to misunderstand each other. No more mistakes, Apostle Kang. You must make Sang-mi into the Spiritual Mother without any mistakes so that I, the Spiritual Father you, and your daughter can ascend hand-in-hand to the New Sky. Don't you agree? Make sure you stay awake. It would be such a shame if you, alone, were to miss the Ship of Salvation. I believe. Yes, that's the Kang Eun-shil I know. Continue to keep your faith strong like that. You still look at me like that. Your father used to look at me like that, too. To your father... I was just the son of a butcher. I thought that would be the end of it when he passed away. But at some point, I saw that same look of contempt... in your eyes, too. But... with Ji-hee... she doesn't look at me with the contempt that you do. She respects me. Something that you were never able to give me, Ji-hee gives it to me. So, you just stay like that and never wake up. That way, people will remember me as the romanticist politician who loved his sick wife. Honey, you have to get up. You know how worried Sang-hwan is about you. Father. Yes? This would've never happened if you stayed in Seoul. Your mother would've been so worried if she knew. I have something to ask of you. A friend of mine is trapped in a weird religious cult. Getting her out is proving to be difficult. It's called "Gooseonwon." From the outside, it just looks like a normal church as they have a nursing home, farm, and do lots of volunteer work. But in actual fact, it's a terrifying cult. Could you please help us get her out of there so that she can live her life properly? I'm a politician. If you want a favor, you have to know what that person wants in return. Very well. I'll go back to Seoul and become a judge or a prosecutor. Will that do? Okay. I'll look into it. Thank you. Forget it. You're my kid. Let's go home now. Your mother needs to sleep. Joon-gu. I haven't asked what any of this is about because I owe you from back in prison. But why is that man here? Why? Do you know Chief Lee? What's this? You're that kid from three years ago. I'll be going. Did you all set a date or something? The governor's punk son gave me aggro during the day. Han Sang-hwan? You know him, too? For goodness' sake. This town. What about him? He brought a girl in who was trapped in some cult and was causing problems. What happened to the girl? You know her, too? Jeez. Her dad took her back. What do you mean? You're a cop. Why would you send her back? Why, you little... Do you two cause trouble in pairs? Do you still live like that? What? Hey, you need to curb your temper if you've been to prison. Or I might throw you back in there. I've now repaid my debt to you, Joon-gu. What? That... Is he one of yours? Put a leash on him. Someone like him can't be tamed. He's living his own life. You got the ledger, right? Now, with Lee Jin-seok, can I do as I please? Is she taking her medication well? Yes. Okay. Then you may leave. Sister Kim. Sang-mi came back here after leaving. She could've not come back, but she chose to. Do you know why? Because of you, she says. My daughter... My daughter, Yoo-ra, left this place. Because of that, she made me sin greatly against the Mighty New Sky and the Spiritual Father. However, Sang-mi returned here. That's why I hate you so much. You have a daughter who's protecting you, even though you've gone insane. I hate it so much. My love. My salvation. My Mighty New Sky. My love, the Spiritual Father. That's right. You must continue to stay here like this. I shall make your daughter into the Spiritual Mother, and gain virtue with the Mighty New Sky so I can ride the Ship of Salvation with my daughter. So, Sister Kim, please continue to keep Sang-mi here for me. You must do that. This place is the New Sky. Eternal life. Salvation. We shall be blessed. Wow, this is like some kind of spy movie. So... who should I get for you first? Mr. Cheon? Assemblyman Park? Chief Lee. Yes? If you can't keep a poker face when you have a good hand, you won't win anything. Right, yes. Start with Mr. Cheon's man, Chief Park Jeong-min. Sure thing. By the way, if Governor Han continues to weed out all corrupt officials like this, then Mooji might just become the greatest town in the country. That's only because we have people like you here working tirelessly for Mooji. Wouldn't you say so? You flatter me. Until next time. What is it you low-lives are planning this time? You best not be gambling. You got it? Lady, that's not what it is. I don't see no "lady" here. Call me "big sister." Well, if it isn't Dong-chul! Hi. What happened to your face? Sup. What happened? Why did she go back there? Sang-mi... expected things to turn out like this. This Gooseonwon place... they even have control over the police. I'm going to try whatever I can, my way. What are you gonna do? I asked my father. I asked him to help. I... usually don't trust fathers. Dong-chul. -I tried. -It's all useless. I'm also going to try things my way now. What do you mean by that? You've always fought with your head, and me, my guts. -Don't tell me you're... -I need to see what kind of place it is for myself. Dong-chul. Have you lost it? You don't know what it's like in there. You can't go there alone. Sang-hwan. That's why... one of us needs to know how that place works for us to help her. They know what you all look like. That's why... I'm going in. Please recite the Prayer of Salvation. If you do, I'll give you the Water of Salvation. POLICE Mr. Park Jeong-min. Please open up. Mr. Cheon, I've got a big problem here. The police have got a warrant and are here at my house, knocking at the door. Mr. Park, we'll force our way in. Pardon? Mr. Park! Are you being serious? Hello there, Chief Park Jeong-min. Planning to jump down from there? Don't bother injuring yourself, just come out the front door. I'm done for. In order to entice Christians, first, you need to carry a Bible or wear a cross used by mainstream churches. Then build a relationship, telling them you just moved here and want to find a good church in the area. Excuse me, but wouldn't people think we're lying? There is a passage in the Book of Salvation. "Whether it be through lies or truth, whatever means it takes, spreading the word of the Mighty New Sky is something joyous, so he commands that you continue to be happy." That's why we don't call it lying... but instead, the "Salvation Stratagem." If you use the Salvation Stratagem correctly, you shall be greatly rewarded. As we are doing a good thing by saving people through the power of faith, the Mighty New Sky will actually look upon us as being righteous. Do you understand? I believe. Then we'll finish today's lesson here. We're going out to spread our word now, so please get ready. Yes, ma'am. Sister Hong. Yes? How long has it been since you joined Gooseonwon? A little over a year now. I've been observing you all this time, and from volunteer work to scripture seminars and propagation training, you've been serving most diligently. The Spiritual Father and the Mighty New Sky are most pleased. We shall be blessed. I believe. What is your wish, Sister Hong? To ride on the Ship of Salvation, of course. If you want that wish to come true, how would you like to become the Spiritual Mother's right-hand helper? Right-hand helper? Out of all of us, you'll get to be closest to the Spiritual Mother, while serving both her and the Spiritual Father. It's a position of great honor. Could I really be given such an important task? I shall speak to the Spiritual Father about it. Then will you accept it with your faith? Of course! We shall be blessed. I believe. Thank you so much, Apostle Kang. Sang-mi. If you just recite the Prayer of Salvation... you can get out of here. I... won't give up. You've still a long way to go. -We shall be blessed. -We shall be blessed! I believe. -I believe! -Let's get to it. Sister Hong, that way. Hey! It's the first time we've been to a place like this together. Hey, you think we're here to hang out? It seems she came alone. She's reading a book that I like. Guys, keep it down. Hey, Dong-chul. Yeah, they're in the park. Okay. Be careful. Is he going straight in? We're promoting a concert for people in their 20s and 30s. -If you just fill out a questionnaire... -Sorry, no, thanks. Excuse me? We're promoting a concert for... My laces have come undone again. Excuse me. Yes? Sorry for calling you just like this. Not at all. How can I help you? We're currently promoting a concert for people in their 20s and 30s. If you just fill out a questionnaire on what worries young people have these days, we'll give you concert tickets and a gift voucher. Would you like to help us out? The thing is, my mom wants to have dinner together tonight, so I have to get back quickly. It's her birthday today. Just one minute will do, they're simple questions. -Have some coffee. -Thank you. -Hot! -Oh, no! I'm okay. It's okay. I'll do it. Dong-chul here is so innocent. Isn't that so, So-rin? Yes. You have really kind eyes. No, I don't. My mom always tells me I have weak eyes. Dong-chul, do you think this world is eternal? Well, nothing lasts forever, right? Then do you think that people can have eternal life? Eternal life? I'm not sure. Right. You're not certain, are you? No. But what if someone offered to tell you the secret to obtaining eternal life? What would you say? -Something like that exists? -Of course. You and I coming to meet like this here is no simple coincidence. You can become a chosen one. Me? Become chosen? Yes. If you are chosen, there is a way for you to achieve eternal life and never die. Of course, you haven't quite been chosen yet, but the possibility has opened up today. It's a little hard to follow. So-rin, could you explain things more simply to him? Yes. So, right now, this world may seem like it will never end, but it shall. We call that "Judgment Day." But people only think of the present and aren't preparing for this event. Right, we must be prepared. That's right. We must prepare. But when Judgment Day comes, only those awakened and prepared can ride on the Ship of Salvation. The Ship of Salvation? There's something like that? Why is he taking so long? Why is he taking so long? That woman always talks to people like that, so she'll catch on to anything strange. If he just goes straight in, she'll probably realize, so he's being careful. You think he wouldn't know that? I think they're done! Hello? We're at the park entrance by Meokgol intersection. We've met someone special. Okay. We'll wait outside there. He happened to be nearby, so he's coming to pick us up. How fortunate, right? Oh, really? That's so awesome! Wear this. What for? I'm certain those people don't just approach anyone. They're probably after money. So, we'll need some bait to catch the fish. It was a gift from my mom, so don't lose it. -All right. -And also, we need to make a signal only we know. A signal? -Hey, there's the signal. -Yeah. Please, get in. -Hot today, isn't it? -Yes, scorching. -These people will be going with you. -Nice to meet you. Jeez, would you look at that? Dong-chul is totally fearless! He just got in. Dong-chul's always been like that. Like Bold Guy. Only days of joy lie ahead of you all now. -Congratulations. -Pleasure to meet you all. I'm glad you could come with us. Oh, my, you look like such a nice person. What a nice watch, too. You must be well-off. By the way, did you get your hair done at a salon? Sorry? Why do you ask? I mean, your hairstyle is so unique! Must be because you're young. You don't beat around the bush. Sorry if I came off as rude. Not at all. I like that kind of attitude. GOOSEONWON Come on out. Whoa, I never knew there was such a large building in the mountains. We shall be blessed. We shall be blessed. This is a holy place. Evil souls cannot enter. -Sister So-rin. -Yes? Please explain to them what kind of a place Gooseonwon is, then come up to the church. Very well. See you soon, then. Okay, so please follow me. Dong-chul! Wow, this place is incredible! Why isn't he answering? Come on. Let's go wait inside. -You think everything's all right? -What could go wrong? Let's go in. Okay. This is the large chapel. Everyone. We have new brothers and sisters at Gooseonwon today. Let's welcome them with a big round of applause! Welcome! Okay, then, shall we share our blessings? We shall be blessed. -We shall be blessed! -I believe! I believe! Let's give a round of applause to thank the Mighty New Sky and Spiritual Father for sending us our new chosen brothers and sisters who will ride on the Ship of Salvation. Welcome. Welcome. JEONG-HOON Why isn't Dong-chul picking up his phone? Stop it already. What if something happens because you keep calling? Hey, what if he's been found out and they're beating him up? They're not gangsters. We don't know that yet. Those people are way more brutal than gangsters. Don't you watch TV? They wail on people with clubs, kill them, some even bury people. What if it's one of those places? You wanna stop talking nonsense? No, I'm saying... we need to be prepared for any eventuality. Guys. I'm gonna head out for a bit. Where to? -There's someone I need to meet. -Who? I'll tell you later. Let me know if Dong-chul comes back. Okay. Goodbye. See you on Wednesday. Dong-chul. Why are you just going? We have a reception for our new members. Come talk with us first. Right. Your mother told you to come back home early. Right. It's her birthday today. Oh, of course. We'll throw her a birthday party if you bring her along. How does that sound? I think I'll have to leave it here for today. I'm really sorry about that. You've nothing to be sorry for. We have a formal service tomorrow, so come by then. Tomorrow? Sang-jin? Sang-mi. Sang-jin. Is it really you? I'm sorry. It's really tough, right? No. I'm fine. Sang-mi. You can get through this. Just hang in there a little longer. You can do it. Yeah. I'm going to get through this. I'm going to... make it back to the outside world. Good. Sang-jin. I'm going to do things my way, too. There's not a person with power here in Mooji that isn't associated with that place. Particularly the prosecution and the police. It's best you understand that they are all connected to that cult leader. I know that. If the police weren't in the pockets of Gooseonwon... I wouldn't have needed to ask my dad for help. You asked your father? Then why did you want to see me? Because... I can't trust him. Can you trust me? No. -Then what is this? -I know... my father is planning to campaign to be the governor. If I expose your relationship with him, it would be a fatal blow to his campaign. What are you doing right now? I'm making a request you cannot refuse. Who do you think people will believe? You or your father? Mooji is much smaller than you think. Whether people believe it or not, word gets around. My father will try to sort out the situation at all costs to become the provincial governor. Do you think he'll give up everything and choose you? That sounds like a threat. You... have no choice but to help me with this. Hello. You said your name was Dong-chul, right? Yes. I'll give you a ride. Hop in. It'll take you forever to walk to the bus stop. I'm grateful for the offer, but... It's okay. We were on our way to buy something from the market anyway. Get in. -Are you sure? -Why, of course. Thank you. Oh, Dong-chul, how did you get that scar on your face? This here? I fell over when I was drunk. Oh, dear. Have you lived here long? Well, I guess it's been around a year. -I moved here. -Oh, is that so? But may I ask why you moved here? My father wanted to live in a quiet town. I guess he got tired of running his business. What kind of business? -It's okay, don't mind us. Just answer it. -Okay. Hey! Don't you think you should let us know whether you're okay or not? I'll call you back later. Later? What do you mean, later? We've been waiting all day. Why haven't you called? Jeez, I'll just pay you back! You call yourself a friend? Hey, what are you talking about? Dude, don't you know how well my dad's business is doing? Are you gonna be like this over a few measly grand? Whatever. I'll tell my dad to send you the money right away. I'm hanging up now. Jeez. I didn't want to hurt my pride by asking my dad for money. That pathetic loser. I spoke too loudly, right? Oh, not at all. It's fine. Anyway, Dong-chul, it seems your father's business is doing very well. My father? Not really. Just a little. What'd he say? Has he gone crazy? He started going on about money and business. He must still be with them. Yeah, must be. That's why I told you not to call him! -I was worried about him. -This is your fault if things go south. -Why is it my fault? -It's your fault. Dude, I was worried, so I called. Fine, then it was my fingers' fault, as they dialed the phone. Wanna break them? -Yeah, I do. -No, stop. What are you punks doing? Lady, you gotta stop insulting us. We don't come here for you to say mean things. What's that? Assorted skewers? I love assorted skewers. Lady. Are you crazy? Big sister. What did you call me? Big sister. Hey! Big sister. Seriously, the skewers my big sister makes are the best skewers ever, right? Yeah. Big sister, you're the best. Fine, eat up. That was painful. Let's eat. These are good. Right, Dong-chul. Could you tell me your phone number? Give me your phone. I'll enter it. Sure. Then I'll contact you tomorrow. That's my number, so save it to your contacts. Apostle Jo Wan-tae. Apostle Jo? Yes. See you here, tomorrow. -Okay, see you then. -I love you. Yeah, it's me. Where are you? Do you guys live here? Why do you kids spend all day and night here? One draft beer, please. Dong-chul. Did you see Sang-mi? No. Maybe she's locked up somewhere. Saw anything weird or messed up there? The people there... actually seemed happier than I thought. Don't be fooled. They may look fine on the outside, but they're rotten on the inside. Yeah. Okay. I've agreed to meet them again tomorrow, so I'm bound to find something if I go again. Anyhow... don't you think we're acting too dangerously? It's great that we're helping, but we gotta think of our safety. You just need to not stream everything. That would be helping. Here, eat. You have grown weak after fighting with the evil spirit. I spent all night thinking about how all I thought about was running away every time. But this time, I'm not going to run. I'm gonna bring that place down... no matter what. That's it. You're doing so well. Patience... shall grant you a new life. Sang-mi. Now, please recite... the Prayer of Salvation. You are the king of the New Sky. Creator and complete true love. I confess to you all my sins, and give you everything of mine. Oh, Mighty New Sky. You shall take the highest honor. With the highest, and largest heart of gratitude... I worship the Mighty New Sky and my father, the Spiritual Father, and give you... all of my heart. My love. My salvation. We shall be blessed. Hello? Your father wants to see you. Come to the nursing home. GOOSEONWON NURSING HOME These are the clothes you shall wear at the proclamation ceremony for today's service. Put them on. Once the Spiritual Father makes the announcement, you'll be trained on becoming the Spiritual Mother. Then you'll have a wedding of the New Sky. That's why you need to take care of your body and mind. Okay, put them on. Sister Kim, what do you think? The Spiritual Mother is so beautiful, right? You look pretty. So lovely. Mom. Mom. Don't worry. I... will make sure we are happy again like we once were. Thank you for coming all this way. Sang-hwan's here. This is my son. Your son has such a pure soul.
