 SAVE ME EPISODE 6 Excuse me. I apologize. We made a big mistake. I want to apologize once more. Right, going down an alleyway at that speed... I think I've dislocated my shoulder. Are you guys all right? Wow, this is severe. I wasn't going to go that far, but my father is a police officer. Shall I call him? However, from the three of you... I think I can smell alcohol.

 Shall we go to your father's station for a breathalyzer test? Would that be okay? Well, we are also partly to blame. Let's leave things here. Yes. Seeing as we're all at fault here. Right? Yes. Save me. Do you... still have something more to say? -Hey! Look what happened because of you. -Me? You said we should be fine if we come this way. But you led the way here. Whatever. Let's go.

 -Bye. -Goodbye. Be careful. Okay, lift it up. Did you see that? See what? Right. That woman, yeah? Yeah, right. She was pretty. I would have tried it on if I was just 15 years older. That was Sang-mi, wasn't it? Yeah. Sang... Sang-mi? She's that Seoul chick. But she disappeared when her brother died. I thought she went back to Seoul. Guess she came back. What about her? Have you ever heard... someone asking you to save them? To save them? I'm sure that's what she said to me. She didn't say, "Help me." She said, "Save me." So, those kids just now. They seemed a similar age to Sang-mi. You happened to know them, do you? Sang-mi. Sang-mi quit school not long after transferring. She probably never had a chance to make friends. Don't worry. We here are your family and friends. I'll make sure that you aren't lonely. Apostle Jo. Yes? Let us go quietly, in self-reflection. We aren't going somewhere to have fun. Okay. I believe in the Mighty New Sky, my savior. My pain and... Did they go this way? What are you doing? This is a live broadcast of us saving a girl who's in danger! "Jeong-hoon is on the job!" Are you kidding me? Just you watch how many donate. What's this? Hey! What are we gonna do? Let's go this way. Okay, bros! I've started a sudden stream here. Today's stream is a thriller motorbike chase. A motorbike chase stream. You can see that van in front, right? You can see it, yeah? We're following it right now. We're following the van on two bikes. Please... Sang-hwan! -Sang-hwan, are you okay? -You okay? What the... Mister! Learn to drive! Go back home! And don't drive again! Sang-hwan! -Sang-hwan, you okay? -Yeah, I'm fine. That scared me. Anyhow, those guys are following the traffic rules well. Let go of me! Sang-mi, I will never give up on you! Stop it! Stop it! They're moving. Hey! Watch it! -Here's the key. -Thank you. We'll come and pick you up for morning prayer tomorrow. Okay. Let's go. Sang-mi. Think of your mother if things are tough for you. You can't keep running off and leave your weak mother behind. No matter what is said, you and your father, Apostle Im, are the only ones who can take care of her. However much we promise to look after her, we can't do a better job than you two. That's right. You all must be exhausted. Please, get going. We shall. Good night. Why aren't you coming in? Whatever you may be thinking, whatever you plan on doing, do not forget that from the hairs on your head, the Mighty New Sky... knows everything. Why are you doing this? Just why... Why are you doing this? Those people... killed Jeong-gu. And now, Mom... I don't know what they'll do to her. So, please... Please, help me. Dad. It's all your fault. -What? -If you had only... only... relinquished your stubborn ways, and left everything to the Mighty New Sky, your mother would have... no doubt returned to normal. Governor. Will you continue to just let Sang-hwan be? That kid... When a bird is in its cage... I feel like it's mine. But when you open the cage doors... it just flies off easily at any time. The world is still too dangerous for him to live without his parents. I'll call it in. It's just barely alive. That's not living. The Mighty New Sky, who defeated the power of death with the blood of the lamb and resurrected. With the blood of the lamb, please guide us. With the blood of the lamb, please save us. With the blood of the lamb, please cleanse us of our sins. With the blood of the lamb, please make us reborn. With the blood of the lamb, please defeat Satan. Please save us. Please lead the evil souls, and the souls who lead us into temptation, to destroy themselves! When we stand against Satan's power, help us live victoriously! You're still awake. Were you waiting for me? Why do your eyes look so lonely today? When you stare at me like that... it breaks my heart. Save me. I wonder if just like her... you have something you want to say to me. Why are you looking at me like that? Mom. This time... I don't want to run. So, please... Please help me, Mom. Please, Mom. What is it? Boss. This is my junior I was telling you about. Introduce yourself. I'm Seok Dong-chul. You should be resting after just getting out of the slammer. Why do you wanna work? I need money. I like this punk's lack of etiquette. Why do you need money? For women? I'm going to buy a house for my grandma. Prison seems to have made you into such a good boy. Show him properly how things are done. Thank you, boss. You know Mom doesn't like the smell of blood in the house. Sang-hwan. You know how old I was when I started smelling blood? Since I started elementary school. Others would buy pencil cases and school bags, while running excitedly around the neighborhood. But your grandfather... you know what he said to me as he handed me this ax? "Yong-min. Remember the smell of blood. If you don't want to spend your life smelling the foul stench of blood, you must never be weak. Do you understand what I'm saying?" "Yes, Father." I understand how you feel. Three years was enough, tormenting yourself over it. Now it's time to forget it... and go back to Seoul. Father. Why do you keep telling me to forget it? Everyone's telling me to forget it and move on, but... I can't just do that! You think you can change anything? Both people and animals are born with their own fate. Is living just as you say meant to be my fate? Do you really... not know how I feel? It's all for you! It's not for me, it's all for yourself! You want to be the provincial governor! What are you talking about? Just like three years ago, I know you're trying to sever anything that could be a problem. ARABIAN NIGHTS Hey! Who are you? What a junkie. Hey! Drink responsibly during the day. This ain't your establishment to barge into. It's heavy. What the... Look at these colors. -What's going on? -I apologize. What's this? I'm tired. Is there anyone else here... who wants to have their head kicked in? I... I'm sorry about this. Let's continue the game another time. Yes. It was starting to get boring anyway, right? Let's go. It's been a while, Hair Clipper. I missed you, Jin-seok. I waited nine years to see you. Oh, really? Has it been nine years already? Come on! Don't make me upset here. I was framed for murder because of you. You can't just forget about that, buddy. I was gonna clip your hair for you today. But forget it. You need to grow it some more. That way, when we do cut it, it'll stand out. I knew it. This is why we're friends. Get a load of this! Get some new tools, would you, fellas? Why do you always carry the same sticks and hammers? Are you guys carpenters? Aren't you tired of all this? Come at me. Now that you've got a clean new cut, live as if you're reborn. Lee Jin-seok. The thing with me... I read the Bible while locked up inside. There's this guy called Job in there. You know? God put Job through immeasurable amounts of pain. Do you know why? To teach him not to be arrogant. And now... I am God... and you are Job. You got out. Punk. Working here now? How is it? I'm adjusting. Have you met your friends? Fair enough. When you get older, your friends become enemies, and your enemies become friends. Where will you stay? Wherever I go, I'll be in this neighborhood. Dong-chul. Yes? You and I are living with a hot lump of iron in our hearts. Find me if you're ever in trouble. See you around. GUSEONWON Thank you, everyone. Sang-mi, did you sleep well? Don't worry. I pray with everything I have, so there will be an answer. We shall be blessed. I believe. We shall be blessed. I believe. Disgusting. Sang-mi. What did you just say? Sang-mi, did you just say... I said, disgusting. Dad, and you, too, are all disgusting! We can't have such words coming from those pretty lips. Isn't that right, my sister? My son has already gone to school. Why hasn't Sang-mi gone yet? Is something wrong? Mom... Don't worry. We shall take Sang-mi to school. Thank you so much. Thank you for always caring for my son and daughter. It's nothing. Of course, we should help. Sang-mi. Unless you want to make your mother worry, you mustn't say or do anything bad from now on. You understand what I mean, right? Spiritual Father. It's me, Yoon Dal-seok from the Peace Festival. Yes, please enter. Please take a seat here. Spiritual Father... please save me! Tell me what it is. The Mighty New Sky... will protect you. I recently went to the hospital because my stomach hurt. They told me it's late-stage stomach cancer. Spiritual Father. Please save me! I shall give the land from my father and my farm all to the Mighty New Sky. So, Spiritual Father, with the power of the Holy Spirit... please rip this wicked, evil cancer of Satan out of my body! Please... The New Sky is a place for those poor in spirit. If you cast away all earthly desires, you shall be able to ride the Ship of Salvation. I shall give him everything. We shall be blessed. I believe. Grandma. I brought those dried persimmons you like. You doing okay up there? You're not going around collecting cardboard boxes up there, too, are you? I... I don't know about anything else... but I hope you're standing up straight in heaven. Dong-chul. My baby. Dong-chul... Oh, my poor baby. Dong-chul! Dong-chul... Dong-chul. I'm sorry. For making you... go up to heaven all alone. I'm really sorry. It's time to begin, Sang-mi. You heard what Apostle Jo said earlier. Unless you want to make your mother worry, you mustn't say or do anything bad from now on. Okay? We're campaigning to sponsor overseas children. Please take the time to fill out a questionnaire. Excuse me. If you're not too busy, would you like to fill out a questionnaire for our overseas child sponsoring campaign? A questionnaire? It will only take a minute. So, what should I do? Please fill it out over here. Thank you. Just briefly fill out your personal details. Okay. Here you go. I see you go to a good university. Yes. You must be busy preparing for a job as it's your final year. Yeah, well, it's not just me. We all are. Thank you, goodbye... -Just a moment. -Yes? Your parents must be so worried about you. Sorry, what do you mean? The opportunity to improve things is right in front of you. You can't just stand there and not take it. I still don't quite follow... You see that? Pool should be played downtown. I'm potting everything! No, you didn't. What are you talking about? Let's go again. Let's do this. Move! I'll hit you. I warned you to move. It'll hit you in the face. I warned you to move. Move already. Sang-hwan, please get him out of the way. I'm getting stressed out here. Sang-hwan. Sang... Mr. Han Sang-hwan? Yeah, what? You still thinking about yesterday? I wanna forget it, but it keeps replaying in my head. Just stop caring about it. She's been fine up until now. She'll be fine in the future, too. Does she have no one else that she asked me of all people to save her? Shall we try looking for her, then? You think you can? What are you talking about? And that curly-haired man seemed like a nice dude. She's fine! Calm down. Go look for her? Seriously. She's fine. Sang-hwan, forget about her. Okay? Guys. Would you call something like this coincidence or fate? What is it? The day of salvation is not far off. The most important thing is what values you live by. They say today's young generation must give up on seven things. Love life, marriage, children, relationships, house, dreams, and hopes. Do you really want to give up on these things? Well, no, I don't. So, before it's too late, you need to think about what happiness is, and what values are truly important to you. If you live being swept up by the fast currents, you're left with nothing. I lived through my 20s, so I'm well aware that your 20s are your most important years. What are they doing? Something smells fishy... That's the smell of your philtrum. Give it a rest and let's play pool. It doesn't look like much is up with her on the surface. Why did she ask you to save her? Let's go find out for ourselves. Hey, where are you going? Where are you going? Don't do it, guys! You'll embarrass yourselves! Don't go out there! Salvation is not a difficult word. If you take a look at the pamphlet... Hey, you! We agreed yesterday's accident... Do you... really need my help? If you're in danger, I'll help you. Danger? I shall call the police if you don't leave us alone. On what grounds will you call them? Please state a legal reason. We'll call the police if you don't stop! The police! Police. There! Police. Sang-mi, you tell them. Tell them if you're in danger or not right now. Unless you want to make your mother worry, you mustn't say or do anything bad from now on. You understand what I mean, right? It's okay, you can tell me. If you really are in danger, this time, I'll be sure to help you. Leave. Sorry? Please get out of my sight. You heard it yourself. Are you being serious? Let's go, Sang-mi. Your soul will die if you keep talking to this evil soul. Quickly. Please drive. Let's go. Come on, let's go. Come on. THE SHIP OF SALVATION SHALL MAKE YOU WHOLE Let go of me! Apostle Kang. You're back early. Have you already finished finding new followers? Satan appeared as we were doing it. What do you mean? Satan, you say? Those strange youths that we met in the alleyway last night appeared and tried to tempt Sang-mi with Satan's words. What? Satan shall leave. In the name of the Mighty New Sky, you shall be cleansed. You shall be cleansed. Look here. Your soul is evil, that's why Satan appears before you! That's right, Sang-mi. Apostle Im's words speak the truth. The Ship of Salvation, which we must board, is a place that only allows the chosen disciples with clean souls aboard. You also need to ride it when called so you can see your brother. Don't you agree? Yes. That's right. Surely, my whole family shall ride the Ship of Salvation to the New Sky together. I shall make sure... I shall make sure that happens. I believe. Look! My wife said she's taking the kids to some weird church to live there. How could I not lose it? That doesn't give you the right to smash up Mr. Jo's sign. His sign was blocking my way on the street. He provoked me! Punk, you want me to call your uncle? Come on! Do you wanna see me get my legs broken? Move. This neighborhood. I'm getting sick of it. Sir, where are you going? Please find my granddaughter. Ma'am, you need to speak to an investigator. I'm just here on an errand. What did you say? You need to find an investigator! In-ves-ti-ga-tor! I don't need to find an investor! I need you to find my granddaughter! Is everything okay here? This lady's granddaughter left home and hasn't returned. She wants us to find her. Ma'am. When did your granddaughter leave the house? What did he say? When did you say your granddaughter left the house? It's been over a month. I'll look into it and contact you. -Oh, my. You are a blessed man! -Sorry? Yes, thank you, ma'am. Get home safely. Oh, my, thank you so much. RELIGION? RUN AWAY FROM HOME? Has this girl been brainwashed, too? Hey. Be honest here. Would you like it if someone started butting into your family affairs? Everyone has their own story. I'm sure there aren't any families anywhere without one. They fight and make up over and over again. That's how they live. They say even police don't get involved in family business. What if... that wasn't the case? What? Help. Please help my brother. -What's wrong? -I think he's been taken to the rooftop! You said you'll take care of it yourself. Dong-chul, let's go play basketball. Save me. I did that three years ago. I just walked on by, but she really needed help in that moment. What if this time... is also the same? Then shall we go to their hideout? Hey, what's wrong with you? How would we even find out where it is? We lost the van at the Yongmieup intersection last night, right? Yeah, why? There's no way they've never ordered black bean noodles at least once. JANGPUNG You don't order food these days, yet it seems you're trying to order me around. Oh, Pil-soo! It's because we miss you! Am I your girlfriend? But you don't have one. What, you little punk? Pil-soo, have you made any deliveries to any strange people around Yongmieup recently at all? Strange people? A man with curly hair that doesn't suit him, a woman with eyes that cut like laser beams, and a real hot Seoul chick. Right? What a stupid combination. It's like ordering pasta at a Chinese restaurant. Please, think hard. Sang-hwan, as you know, I'm really familiar with the Yongmieup area. That's Chili Paste. Hey! Chili Paste! Get over here! What? Chili Paste. You distributed flyers around Yongmieup recently, right? The boss told me to. What was I supposed to do? Quit? Yeah, all right. Whatever. Recently, have you made any deliveries to a house with a really pretty girl you can't get your mind off? Pil-soo, it's not just the pretty girl. There's also... The one with the really white skin, yeah? Yeah, I did see her once. And I do think about her quite often. -When did you see her? -I literally just made a delivery there. You see? You see? We never forget a pretty girl when we see one! -I truly respect you, sir. -Zip it, would you? Where was it? You're going there now? We know the address now, so let's go home and meet up early tomorrow. What's up with you? You don't want to go now? They say haste makes waste. I'm off. See you tomorrow. See you. Bye. All the guys you want, ladies. All the guys you want, ladies. All the... How humiliating. -What is this? -That's right. Boys need to have a drive. This work okay for you? Yes. Wanna go for a drink afterwards? Sure. Hey, mister. Do I really get all the girls I want here? Hey, I don't want to go here. I wanted to go for some karaoke. Yeah. All the ladies you want, sir. We're experts at finding you a partner. Number one in the country. Don't mind it. That's just life for you. When I graduated, I thought I'd enter a gang and climb to the top ranks. Who'd have thought I'd turn out like this? Here. Don't pay attention. You haven't been out of jail long. Don't take any risks. Get back here! -Help me! Someone, help me! -Quiet! Get over here. Come here. Get in. -Get in! -Help me! Hey! Calm down. It's got nothing to do with you. I don't use my head for fights. It's all about guts. -What does this punk think he's doing? -You have until three to come out. You're insane! One. Two. Three. What the... Have you lost it? You crazy little... That kid's insane. Have you lost your mind, sir? Did I not... give you until the count of three... to come out of your car? Hey! Did you think you'd be cool if you came to save her alone? Why are you two here? We're a team. Just a second. What are you doing? I mean, if I'm risking my life, I should at least try and make some money. Don't worry, I'll be quiet. You have to keep it quiet. The moment we jump the wall, this is for real. You ready? Yeah. Let's do this. SAVE ME OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
