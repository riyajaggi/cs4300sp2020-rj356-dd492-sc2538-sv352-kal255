 THE SHIP OF SALVATION SHALL MAKE YOU WHOLE SAVE ME EPISODE 9 Please, this way. Drink up. Hello, assemblyman. I seem to be a little late. Not at all. Come sit over here, my busy brother. Sit on this cushion here. Thank you, Mr. Kim. Long time no see, Governor Han. Spending time with that young aide of yours

 seems to have taken a few years off you, too. You're looking great, too, Director Ji. The Chairman Kim scandal must have been tough on you. Oh, my, what's with this friction? I finally come back home, and you two are going to be like this? Please, have a drink. So, about the terminal relocation project. You're well aware... of my interest in it, right? Of course I am. It was one of your pledges. I'm thoroughly reviewing it to see it happens without any mistakes. Right, mistakes would be a big problem. -Okay, let's drink. -Sure.

 Hello. What are you doing? Shake hands. We'll need the former and current governors to join forces for our district to also develop greatly, no? It's been a long time, Governor Han. Yes, it has been a long time, Mr. Cheon. Assemblyman! Was the food to your taste? Who's this guy? This is the chairman of the Youth Committee I mentioned before. This is the guy you were talking about? This is one of Mr. Cheon's dogs. His name is Lee Jin-seok. Let me formally introduce myself. Hello. I'm Lee Jin-seok, Chairman of the regional Youth Committee. I see. We need young, patriotic men like you for democracy to flourish. It's an honor, Governor Han. Are you sure you're Chairman of the Youth Committee? Sorry? You're not a chairman, you're a gangster! Governor Han, can't gangsters get involved in politics? -Are you siding with a gangster right now? -What? Hey, come on, you two! Don't fight over something like this. If we can't attain salvation here, we're all done for anyway. Sir, let's go. Okay. Then I'll see you around. Yes, see you. -Right! -Yes? I heard your son was back in town. He's not causing trouble these days, right? From what Chief Kim says, it seems that your son was at the scene when the union president's boy was injured. His name is Sang-hwan, right? Han Sang-hwan? Mr. Cheon. If you want to be treated as the former governor here in Mooji, then I suggest you shut that mouth of yours. If you ever bring up my son to threaten me with, you will be sorry. Very well. In that case, let me formally apologize. Do you want me to tell you what that hand is for? It's for wiping your butt. Your filthy butt! Ms. Lee. Take good care of Governor Han. That mouth of his could land him in hot water. Mr. Cheon. Live a long life. Until you grow old and senile. Goodbye. GOOSEONWON FOOD IN A FLASH Sang-mi... I mean, future Spiritual Mother. You're quite athletic as you used to play volleyball. So, who knows when you'll try running off again? That won't happen again. Sang-mi and I are doing lots of praying. That's right, it's all in the past now. They'll no doubt come this way. -Hey, Dong-chul. -Have you stopped them? No, we will soon. I'll call you when it's done. Hey. -You ready? -Dude, I'm a policeman's son. And I'm a wrestler. Let's go. They are demons. They're here to try and dare to take what is the Mighty New Sky's. Do you know the best ammunition against evil demons like them? This. They need a good beating to knock sense into them. Brother Wan-deok. HANG ON. I WILL COME AND SAVE YOU. What do you think you're doing? Sang-mi! -Where are you going? -Get off! -Hey, Sang-mi! -Sang-mi! Don't let them fool you! Sang-mi, stay with us! Sang-mi, don't be fooled! They're demons! What are you doing? Get out! Sang-mi! Sang-mi! Sang-mi! You demons! Sang-mi! In the stream. Sang-mi! Come back! How dare you covet Mighty New Sky's daughter! Sang-mi! Stop, you demons! Sang-mi! Apostle Kang! Sang-mi! Sang-mi! Sang-mi! What do we do? Very well. Come back for now. -Man-hee. -Yeah? No one's following. Slow down a bit. Okay. Apostle Kang. Sang-mi will... be fine, right? No. We need to make sure she's saved. She must receive salvation. Look... Apostle Kang. Hey. Stop looking and get back up here! Stupid fool. Damn. Apostle Jo. What should we do now? Don't worry. All which is the Mighty New Sky's is bound to return to his embrace. We shall be blessed. I believe. Isn't that right, Apostle Kang? Apostle Kang? Yes? I wonder what's gotten into you. Don't be so nervous. Are you worried... -something will happen to her like Yoo-ra? -What? Watch what you say. I will make sure... Sang-mi becomes the Spiritual Mother. Without fail. -We shall be blessed. -Without fail. Ouch. You okay? My stomach really hurts. Why did you come here? Because I wasn't able to say sorry... or thank you... or anything else to you, before. You don't need to say any of that. I'm alive because of you. If you hadn't helped me that day... I would've probably died like my brother. So... you have to live, too. Thank you. All of you... thank you so much. No. It's nothing. I mean, it hurts a little bit, but the four us are together again thanks to it. It's all fine. The fight could get tougher from now on. You know, they're going to come looking for us. Where are we gonna hide? WE DELIVER ALL OVER MOOJI Hey, shouldn't we return the car first? I can't wait to see the look on his face when we do. We're going to a friend's place. You don't need to worry. In order to retrieve one of my lost lambs, I'm even prepared to go to the valley of death. However, a child who has lost faith is no longer a child of the Mighty New Sky. Spiritual Father. No... Please... Please save my Sang-mi. Who shall drive out the demons plaguing her? There's no one but you, Spiritual Father. I... I beg this of you. Spiritual Father. Please. Apostle Im, you must fast and pray from today. Sang-mi has become like this because your prayers were not enough. Brother Wan-deok, why are you just standing there? It seems you, Apostle Kang... don't want to ride on the Ship of Salvation. Spiritual Father. Do you really want to burn forever in the pits of hell? Spiritual Father, you know how I try my best to serve you and the Mighty New Sky. Apostle Kang. There are no second mistakes. Do not disappoint the Mighty New Sky again. Do you understand? Yes. You're scaring her very much, Spiritual Father. You know how hard Apostle Kang is working. Why be like that? Of course she'll do well. Isn't that so? Apostle Jo. Yes? I got a call from Assemblyman Park this morning. It seems... you'll have to work a little hard from now on. All of our work to build... a church of salvation, prayer house, and hospital on this land. Do you want it to go to waste? All of our believers that work so hard for Guesonwon, I must hold them steady so their faith is not rocked. That is my mission here. Isn't it, Apostle Jo? We shall be blessed. I believe. Well, what are you waiting for? Go and bring Sang-mi back here. PARAY MOTEL Seriously. What am I even doing right now? What? You're hungry? Do you not understand the situation now? How can you eat at a time like this? You're not living up to your size! That's why we're in this mess. You! Follow me. Come closer. You think this is the time to stuff your face? Wan-deok. Business problems right now are a pain in my backside. Do you know that or not? Right. I've been under lots of stress lately. So, try and do things well. Act normally, and zip it. Let's go. Officer. Hello. Oh, my. Apostle Jo, have you found them? We checked out everywhere they'd likely go, but no one has seen them. How about on your end, Officer Woo? We put everything else aside to search for them, but we haven't found any clues. Where could they be hiding? What did the youths that took her look like? A roughly 6 foot guy with large eyes... and sharp facial features, another guy around 5'6", with a round face. He had quite a mouth on him. There was also a fat guy, over 200 pounds. They seemed to have an interest in us. They always hang around tightly together. Do you happen to know who they are, Officer Woo? Well... all kids these days fit that description. Tall, short, fat... Kids around here all look like that! Looking at the kids roaming around here, I doubt I'd even recognize my son! -Don't you agree? -Yes. They all look the same, I guess. We're also doing everything to find them, so try not to worry too much. Okay. Please find them. As you know, she's not mentally stable. My goodness, if something were to happen... Oh, my, I just can't... And this time, please take her to the hospital. Of course. What did you guys do? Hey! Are you... Hey. Let them breathe a little. They probably didn't get a chance to. Wow, you guys seriously... How have you guys not changed at all since high school? Give it a rest. Go make us some noodles. That curly-haired guy beat me absolutely everywhere. For real. But you were still adamantly hanging onto his leg. Hanging? Hey, I was holding him down. You saw it, right? Sang-hwan? I didn't see that. You didn't? Wow, Dong-chul. Can you believe this guy? That's harsh, dude. Really harsh. I ran and grabbed onto his leg to stop him from moving, and got beaten up. Okay, okay. I get it. You okay? It's fine now, you can stop shaking. Thank you. Yeah, well... you need to be especially thankful to me. Streamers like me rely on our faces. But look at it now. Give it a rest. Good job. Snap it in half, or the noodles will all break. Don't forget the kimchi and ham. You guys have no manners at all. If you came to someone else's house, you should make the noodles yourselves. By the way... if things had gone this bad, shouldn't you have at least let us know? Let's eat first, then talk. You must be hungry. And spend the night here... What? Stay here for tonight, then tomorrow, let's go to the precinct where Jeong-hoon's dad works and find a way to sort this out. Yeah, right. My dad needs to know the facts before he can help. Hey, hey. Get a book out from there and lay it down. Yeah, let's eat first. JESUS IS MY JOY I'm the president of my church's youth group. You're so cool! How cool of you, Mr. President! How impressive! -Here, let's eat. -Let's eat. There we go. How many packets did you use? Not hungry? In order to receive salvation... they said they must give me... to the cult leader. Are you okay? Die! What are you doing? Someone, help me! My Sang-jin is dead because of you! I'll kill you! -I'll kill you! -Help me! Please, help me! Die! I'll kill you! Get off! Sang-mi! Help me! Honey! I didn't do anything! I just told her to eat, and she started screaming! Sang-mi! It must've been tough for you. Have some rest alone today. -Alone? -Jeong-hoon, give me your phone. Why? Just give it here. Yeah. Right. Keep it just in case. Don't worry. One of us will come running if you call. What about me? Let's go. Hey, this is my home. Let's go already. Let's go. Let's withdraw from here. So, let me get things straight. Her dad gave her to the cult leader for... sexual... I mean, you know... a spiritual wedding with him. That's totally insane. He's completely lost it. The cult leader must've exploited him first. How is someone like that in Mooji? Well, talking about it amongst ourselves won't help. If we go to Jeong-hoon's dad's precinct, they'll investigate and find out, I guess. Hey. Auntie, we're having an important discussion here. -Don't just sneak up like that. -Excuse me? How dare you speak like that. You lot aren't up to anything strange, are you? Please, we're not kids. Who do you think you're staring at? Want me to call your mom here? Why would you call my mom? I'm an adult now. -What are you talking about? It's nothing strange. Don't worry. Here, on the house. Thank you. She could give it to us nicely. She'd be so nice if she didn't get aggravated all the time. Han Sang-hwan. Do you really have to take Sang-mi to the precinct? What do you mean? I don't trust them. We still don't have evidence. You think they'll investigate properly? Hey, my dad does his job well when he has to. That's right. We have a victim here, as well as her detailed testimony. They'll find evidence when they look into it. Evidence? I doubt they'd leave any so carelessly. And even if they did... it's useless. I'll explain all of that to my dad. So, don't worry about it. Here... if you got money and connections, you can make the innocent guilty. That's what happened to me. No? This time will be different. Trust me. Apostle Kang. Hello, Apostle Kang? What is it? I need to give the patients their medication. Of course. Wait, Sister Hong. Yes? I'm not feeling so good today... so please make Sister Kim Bo-eun take these. Me? It's not difficult. Just put them in her mouth, then make sure she swallows them. Okay. DIGESTIVE MEDICATION I believe in my savior, the Mighty New Sky. Mighty New Sky... In order to save my family, you guided my family here to this land of Mooji. However, because our faith was not strong enough, they still do not obey you. Mighty New Sky. Miracles... Miracles... Salvation... Salvation... I believe. I believe. We shall be blessed. I believe. We shall be blessed. Please save us. Good evening. This is a list of businesses associated with Mr. Cheon. Please scare them a little. So, they can decide things for themselves. Very well. I understand. There won't be any trouble from this Cha Joon-gu, I trust? He was double-crossed by Mr. Cheon's guy, Lee Jin-seok, so he harbors a deep grudge. If anything were to go wrong, I can just make it look like revenge between gangsters. He's got no family and isn't in a gang, so don't worry. Chief Lee. Yes? You need to know how valuable a person is. On election day, they also cast a vote. Yes. Of course. Sir! It's a whopper! You're fantastic at fishing, too. You're quite the humanist, sir. For me... I don't fish to catch and eat the fish. I fish because I find it funny when... the fish struggles to survive, even with the hook in its gills. That's why I fish. I see. For goodness' sake. BATTERY Detective, you're becoming quite the regular here. I heard you have something to repay to Lee Jin-seok. Everyone in Mooji knows. Come on, then don't spread rumors, crush him instead. What are you here to tell me? I want you to do a job with me. Think of it as a part-time job. They say you came here after messing up in Seoul. You're a smart guy. Are you forcing me to do your dirty work? That's this town for you. It can even make the innocent guilty. So, sending an actual criminal like yourself back to jail wouldn't take any effort. Don't be scared, you punk. You think I, a detective, would ask you to kill someone? Okay, then, let's do it. What's the job? Like it's written in here, just enter these companies and extract a few ledgers. If you want to end Lee Jin-seok, then you need to go for his superiors first. Wouldn't you agree? See you. You're a carp writhing on my fishhook. This is fun. Fun, indeed. Lord, please help us. Lord... You! Answer me! You're having an affair with that pastor, aren't you? Honey. Please don't say such wicked things. You think I'm a pushover? You crawl out each dawn and come back late at night! That's because you're seeing that pastor! You know that was because I was working overtime at the hospital! Who are you trying to fool? You think I'll believe that? Stop it, Dad! You've lost your mind. Our pastor is such a nice man. Damn! You two are completely insane. Right? Okay. Let's all die today. Let's all die! Help us. Please, help us! Mighty New Sky... please save me from this pain. I will ride on the Ship of Salvation... and see you no matter what, Mighty New Sky. I love you, Mighty New Sky. What are... Those kids. What happened to him? Dad! Your father is a police officer! You can't go around doing stupid things! That's not it, Dad. -Get up for breakfast! -Ouch, okay! You little... I will save you. I will save you no matter what. Hello? It's me. Han Sang-hwan. You need to do a job with me today. Does it have to be today? Dong-chul. Have I ever asked for your help before? Okay. MOOJI CONSTRUCTION OFFICE Aren't you curious about what I called you out to do? I need to pay back what I owe you. Punk. You've grown a lot. Let's go. -What's this? -Hey! Call the guys. Yes, sir. That's right, call them all! Let's take care of this all at once! -He's lost his mind, that punk. -What are you waiting for? All his clothes are dark and black. Who'd want to go around wearing all this? She's not taking part in a fashion show. These clothes don't stick out, so they're better. They're terrible. Your clothes are terrible. But why does she look cute in them? Are you ready? Yes. Let's go. Jeong-hoon. Yeah? Let's take a taxi. A taxi? Why? It's a waste of money. My dad is right next door. Yeah, if we ride the scooters, they'll recognize us. You never know. Okay. In that case, I'll call my dad and ask him to pick us up. Jeong-hoon. Instead of going to your dad's precinct, we'll go to Mooji Police Station. Mooji Police Station? Why? Don't you trust my dad? Or are you looking down on him for working in a precinct? That's not it. Then what is it? Your dad... doesn't think that I'm sane. What? I ran away before, and the people at Gooseonwon told your dad... that I had a mental illness, so he sent me back to Gooseonwon. Look, it's not because of your dad. It's because of Gooseonwon. That's right. It's still the police, it doesn't matter where we go. Yeah, I got it. Yeah. Don't worry. Things are gonna work out. Let's go. We should call Dong-chul though, right? I'll do it. Don't call him. He would've worked all night, so let him rest. Let's finish this one ourselves. Come on. You punk! Sons of bitches! Dong-chul, I'll hold them off here. You go and get the ledger. Hey. Dong-chul. Aren't you the governor's son? I am. What are you going to the police station for? I'm... running an errand for my father. That so? You can't have the ledger. I work for Jin-seok. He's the hand that feeds me. Let's go. Wait. Hey, where are you going? You know me, don't you? Call them. Tell them I'm here. You okay? Hello? Yes. Very well. Well, of course. You shall receive a great blessing, Brother Kim. Yes. We shall be blessed. She just entered the police station a moment ago. What if she were to say something to the police? Isn't the grace of the Mighty New Sky simply marvelous? Sorry? Do you still lack faith? Do not worry. The Mighty New Sky knows... how to use people. Hello, Assemblyman Park. Even though I haven't done anything wrong, why do I feel so guilty coming in here? Can I help you? Why, if it isn't the prince of Mooji. I heard you were at law school in Seoul. Why are you back here? Will I've to start calling you Your Honor if you become a judge or prosecutor? So, you're saying that there's this strange cult, and your dad took you there against your will? And also, that the leader of this cult wants to use religion as a pretext to marry you? Have I understood correctly? Yes. Detective, this is a bit too much. They'll get punished for this, right? Well, let's file this report. Ma'am, could you tell me your name and details? My name is Im Sang-mi. I'm 20 years old. Your name is Im Sang-mi? Yes. And what is your father's name? Im Joo-ho. So, I was looking around last night for nothing. Boys, what's your relation to her? We're friends. Sir. It's Chief Kim. -Right now? -Yes. Hello, sir. Yes. Yes. Okay, then. Goodbye. Call this lady's father and tell him to come. Yes, sir. What did you say? Tell who to come? Look here, Prince Sang-hwan. Her father came in last night and filed a kidnapping case. Thanks to that, we were put on emergency alert and had to stay up all night! Detective. Her dad put a padlock on her door and locked her inside. Under law, that's confinement. Being taken into a cult and forced to marry the leader is classified as coercion. That's confinement and coercion. He may be her family, but it's still a crime. We received a plea for help from our friend, so all we did was free her from confinement. Yet you're still going to call her father? Why are you getting involved in family affairs? And I can't do anything without any evidence. You should know, you went to law school. It's not a family affair, it's a domestic violence issue. Don't you know that as soon as someone reports domestic abuse, that the police must separate the victim and the offender, and take them to a counseling and protection facility? What law would state to call the offender, telling them to come and take the victim? What did you say? Hey. Do you think it's domestic abuse for a parent to discipline their child with a smack? You guys... I can't do anything unless you bring me evidence. That's the law! Do you know how much hassle it is for the police to interfere with religious groups? How could you possibly think that every time someone comes in here asking us to investigate, that we would just jump to it? Jeez, I'm gonna go insane. This is so frustrating. What did you say, punk? Come here. How many times do we have to tell you? Her father and the cult leader are on the same side! Do we have to take a picture of the actual wedding after she's beaten and taken in by her father before you do anything? Why, you little... Hey, law student. This is obstruction of justice right now. Do you want that to be added to charges of kidnapping and contempt of police? Even so, how can you send someone back who came here to ask for help? That's right. You heard what we said, detective. Ma'am, I'm not doing this on purpose. Your father reported you kidnapped, so rather, it looks like these guys will get in trouble. Are you okay with that? I wasn't kidnapped. I asked them to help me. After hearing what happened on the bridge yesterday, that doesn't seem to be the case. Look. This isn't a simple issue. And also, this is a family matter, so the best course of action is for them to talk and resolve this. Ma'am. I'll recommend a family counseling service to you. Please go there with your father. Hey, you. You're a cop. What are you doing right now? "Hey, you"? Her dad locked her up and is marrying her off to his leader! We wouldn't be here if we sort things out! -Detective Kim, take him away! -Yes, sir. -You crazy brat. -Come here. I thought you'd be different as you came from Seoul, but you're the same shit! -Hey, put all of them in a cell! -Yes, sir. How dare you talk to a police officer like that. The police can't be doing this! What? Do you think you're a big shot since you're the governor's son? -Stop. -Don't do something you'll regret forever! -What are you doing? Put him in the cell! -Please, just stop! I'll go back. I'll go back to Gooseonwon. So, please let them go. Sang-mi. We already knew things would turn out this way. I'll try doing whatever I can. That's right. With this kind of issue, sorting it out yourself is the quickest way. Nevertheless, lock them up. -Yes, sir. -These punks... -Let's go. -Move it. I can't believe this. This just doesn't make sense. Something needs to happen before we have a case. Oh, my. Who taught you to drive? This is a crosswalk. DELIVERY IN A FLASH Officer Woo! Hello, there. Oh, my, hello. Take care. Oh, my. That Apostle Jo. SALVATION AND ETERNAL LIFE GOOSEONWON The service has begun. Let's go on up. I'll go up on my own. SAVE ME Hey! Hey! This is the first time we've been to a place like this together. Hey, you think we're here to hang out? Guys, keep it down. Hey, Dong-chul. Yeah, they're in the park. Okay. Be careful. Is he going straight in? My laces have come undone again. Excuse me. Yes? Sorry for calling you just like this. Not at all. How can I help you?
