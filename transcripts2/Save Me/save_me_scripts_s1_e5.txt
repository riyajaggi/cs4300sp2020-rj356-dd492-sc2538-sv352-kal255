 Jeong-gu. Jeong-gu. Jeong-gu. Come on. It's time to play hide-and-seek with me. We have to hide and make sure those people can never find us. Okay? What is it? Don't go overboard. I told you not to defy me or Father, didn't I? Are you a barbarian? Wan-deok. Just do as I tell you. Got it?

 Make sure you hide... It's hard for Jeong-gu. Jeong-gu misses Grandma. Let's go to Grandma. Jeong-gu. You have your phone, right? If you go with me to the police station, I'll buy you a soda. Soda? Ten. Jeong-gu wants ten sodas. Okay. I'll buy you ten. Jeong... Sang-mi. They said you used to play volleyball. You sure are strong. You nearly got away there. You... are the devil. How could you say such words to a man saved by the Mighty New Sky? I won't stand by and do nothing anymore. I won't... let all of you get away with this! What, you'll report us to the police? Sang-mi. I thought you were smart, but you sound like a child now. Your body has now bloomed. Sang-mi. Sang-mi... -Jeong-gu! -Sang-mi. Hey. Here. Select album... Delete. Okay? Jeong-gu! No! Run! -Run! -Sang-mi... Right, well, then. Let's send Jeong-gu to heaven. Jeong-gu! Jeong-gu... Jeong-gu, don't come! ...lost... No! ...hide-and-seek. No! Jeong-gu likes soda. No! Make sure you hide. I can see your hair. Make sure you hide... Found you. Sang-mi. We should go now. We'll be late for morning worship, okay? Let's go. Jeong-gu... Make sure you stay hidden. Until I come to find you... you mustn't come out. I'm sorry for making you come here this early in... Want me to call the police? Or shall we resolve things the Guseonwon way? That hurt my neck. Apostle Kang. Let me know if you're going to hit me. Anyway, I apologize. I shall go repent and testify. Any injuries? I wasn't asking about you. I was asking about Sang-mi. No, she's clean as a whistle. You know she's special, don't you? Of course I do. Get in, Sang-mi. Come on. Sang-mi. You have your phone, right? It's now time to throw away all trivial things. Please, hand it over. TURN OFF Sang-mi. Your body and mind must be clean when meeting the Spiritual Father. Don't you agree, Sang-mi? You two, go and get cleaned up by the nurses at the nursing home. Come on, this is nothing to fuss over. It won't look good to our members. Go and get treated. I'll take Sang-mi from here. Very well. I suppose I should listen to you if I don't want a slap. Good day. Sang-mi, shall we head on up? GUSEONWON I believe in the Mighty New Sky. Please heal my pain and protect my family. You know us better than anyone else. Sang-mi. Dad. Jeong-gu... Why? Why did you do it? Do you want to be taken by the devil and sent to hell? Are you being manipulated by the devil? Dad. Please, don't do this. I can't have this anymore. Sang-mi. From today, we shall fast and pray for repentance. Whatever may happen... I won't give up on you. That's right, Sang-mi. We will never give up on you. Say, "We shall be blessed," already! Don't be afraid. The Mighty New Sky shall always love you. We... shall be blessed. That's it. Sang-mi. Come here. Goodness me, you're cold. Please warm her up quickly. Yes, Spiritual Father. Spiritual Father. My daughter was lured by the devil and did something terrible. Please punish her accordingly. I shall not punish her. Today is an extraordinarily joyous day for me. Please stand. Sorry? A lost sheep has safely found its way back to us. If she had been tossed into that cold world all alone, she would have been in so much pain. Spiritual Father... Please don't be too hard on her. Everyone, you or I, can fall into the temptation of Satan at any time. When times are tough like now, Satan approaches us, a wolf in sheep's clothing, to more strongly tempt us. That's why we must always be aware of this and pray. We shall be blessed. I believe, Spiritual Father. Sang-mi. Just a moment. Silent prayer time is under way. Please keep it quiet. And don't forget that your mother is here, too. What do you think we should do now? Sorry? What do you mean? The child. Jeong-gu. That... was an accident, I tell you. That kid was always... You know, right? He needed to take a leak on the way back from the hospital, then suddenly he ran onto the train tracks! That little punk. The Mighty New Sky knows all. If you have sinned, you must repent. Okay. I'm praying every day as it is anyway. Then, if we're done here... I shall go and pray to the Mighty New Sky. Release Sang-mi from Guseonwon. Pardon? Let's let her live in the outside world for the time being. Wait, we can't let her out when all she thinks about is leaving this place! Don't you know that girl? She's been here for three years, yet no one knows what's going on in that head of hers! Don't worry. The Mighty New Sky knows all. Give it a rest! If something happens because of this, it's all on you. The Mighty New Sky. While we may bow our heads and repent in front of you, there are still times when the evil greed within us humans rears its ugly head. For those poor souls, please help them rid themselves of the thoughts of Satan and guide them with your mighty power... to make them obey to you. The house of Sister Choi, who died last month, is empty. Put her up in there. Do you understand? I do. Spi... Spiritual Father. I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me will live, and though he dies, and whoever lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe in me? I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me will live, and though he dies, and whoever lives and believes... You're right. Our Spiritual Father is the resurrection and the life. Those who believe in the Spiritual Father shall never die. The same goes for Sang-jin, too. Drink plenty of water with it. This is great. Governor, alcohol goes down so well with this food. It seems that you quite like this beef soup. I'm a true Mooji citizen now. Are you sure you are? Pardon? Mr. Cheon's people have been acting unusual lately. There are some annoying flies that are trying to interfere with the work the governor's doing for Mooji's development. This is one of Mr. Cheon's dogs. His name is Lee Jin-seok. If he's not kept on a leash, he could bite someone, no? Here. Becoming a Mooji citizen isn't what's important. What's important is becoming one of my people. I... am one of your people. Everyone, have you been on rides before? Yes. Mister, roller coasters. The rides that go like this. You know what they are, yes? Yes. The car... and then flipped over... then my mind went all fuzzy. That's when... from the distance over there, a bright light shone down on me. And in that bright light my body started to rise up, like this. I'd never felt so warm and comfortable in my whole life. Then from the sky, I heard... "My son. My beloved son. Share the miracle you've just witnessed with the believers at Guseonwon." That's what I heard. -We shall be blessed! -I believe! My friends. Look. I'm perfectly fine! Thanks to the Mighty New Sky's amazing grace and guidance, I walked away from it alive. My friends. Do you believe in the Mighty New Sky and the Spiritual Father who own our lives? -I do! -I do! Do you truly want the Mighty New Sky and the Spiritual Father to protect you? -We shall be blessed! -We shall be blessed! I believe! -We shall be blessed! -I believe! I believe! We shall be blessed! I do believe! I believe in you, the Mighty New Sky, my savior. No one knows my pain better than you do, oh, the Mighty New Sky. Please... Please protect my family. The devil is once again trying to take my daughter away from me. Please protect my daughter, Sang-mi, from being tempted by the devil. My son, Sang-jin... because of me, has gone first to be by your side in the Mighty New Sky... but I am praying our family can meet him once again on the day of salvation. Oh, the Mighty New Sky... I give everything to you. My soul, my life... I give it all to you, the Mighty New Sky. Please... Please protect my family. Please protect my family. Please protect them. Please protect them. During morning prayer at dawn, I saw Jeong-gu and the Mighty New Sky together. Jeong-gu was wearing such a beautiful expression on his face. I shall lay my hands on you and pray for Jeong-gu and you. Mom. I'm sorry... I haven't been able to visit you often. I was reminded of it... whenever I came to Mooji, so it was tough. When did you come back? You didn't tell me. -The day before yesterday. -Then you should come stay at home. Was there a problem at school? Is that why you're back? -I'm sure you've already heard. -Why ask? What are you doing? Sang-hwan. Your mother has lost a lot of muscle. So, I have to massage them regularly. That's not what I mean. Since when did you, my father's aide, start giving my mother massages? I told her to. Why so touchy about it? Father. I don't like just anyone laying their hands on my mom. Okay. I'll do it, then. Don't make your mother worry. I don't know about others, but I thought you were one true to your word. -What's that supposed to mean? -What you promised me last time, That was the only way I could see Dong-chul again. But now, I can never... see him again. Please leave the room. Yes, sir. Sang-hwan. What I'm about to say may sound like an excuse to you, but I did try the best I could. But whatever the reasons may be, a kid was paralyzed because of Dong-chul. So, it was too difficult to get him out. You're studying law, too, so you should know that. I don't believe it anymore. Are you really going to be like this to me? Okay, then. Soon, I'll go and meet with the warden and... Father. Dong-chul was released today. If you had tried as hard as you said, you would've known that. Sang-hwan, I... Maybe Mom... never wanted you to become the governor. What are you talking about? If you became governor, I thought Mom would wake up, and that Dong-chul would come back. But in reality, nothing's changed. Sang-hwan. -Young-min! My goodness! -Young-min! Good to see you. -Come on, let's go. -You rascal. Those kids just pretend to respect me. They're always ordering food. Stop bringing me out this way! I thought I told those kids. Those punks are dead today! No respect for elders here. What a terrible neighborhood. Hey! I told you, you're dead if you order out here again! Come on! It's way better to eat while staring at this gorgeous view. Hey, you! When you leave your empty dishes here, stray dogs come from all over and potty everywhere. How is that our fault? Plus, I don't see any dogs here. You should cover it with newspaper or something once you finished eating. Are you that dumb? Hey, why are your words so violent today? You're gonna bruise my heart! You can forget the radishes. -Taking them back. -Hey, I was joking. You can't have black bean noodles without radishes. Hey! You won't find a girlfriend if you do that! He left. He actually took the radishes and left. How can we eat this without the radishes? Sang-hwan. You performing a ritual? What's on your mind? Dong-chul... He liked black bean noodles. That's right. Dong-chul loved black bean noodles. That time we ate black bean noodles and played pool. Jeong-hoon, you remember that? Yeah, okay,. Just keep eating. You mustn't talk while you're eating, okay? Sang-mi. Let's go. Where are we going? The Spiritual Father has given special permission for you. For the time being, we shall be staying in the town, not in Guseonwon. What about Mom? Sang-mi. It's better if your mother stays here to receive treatment. I cannot leave with my mom. Of course not. You can't just leave here all alone. This place is our heaven and home, right? We shall be blessed. I believe. You'll only be sleeping outside Guseonwon for now. You can come here every day to participate in service with your mother as usual. So, don't worry. Wow, lucky you, Sang-mi. You finally get some time outside of here. Right? Apostle Jo. The world outside is filled with evil souls. What's so great about that? Please refrain from such graceless words. No! I cannot just leave my mom here! Dad. Please, we have to take Mom out of here, too, right? Sang-mi. The two apostles here have agreed to take special care of your mother. Don't worry. These aren't any ordinary people. They are Guseonwon's top apostles. Mom, snap out of it. We have to leave this place. Come with me. Let go of my hand. Mom, if you stay here... If you stay here... I'm not going! I'm going to live in the New Sky with Sang-jin. Don't do this, Mom. This place is hell. It's hell! No! This is the New Sky! Let's fight the demons Our strong brethren! We'll be heroes of the New Sky And each day shall be a victory On the day of judgment We shall ride the Ship of Salvation We shall live We shall be blessed! We shall be blessed with eternal salvation We believe in eternal salvation I believe! We shall be blessed with eternal salvation We shall ascend to the New Sky I believe, the Mighty New Sky! -We shall be blessed. I believe! -I believe. Look. Look how happy she is. We shall be blessed. I believe in the Mighty New Sky. Could you... pull over for a minute? What is it? I need to use the toilet. Hold it if it's not urgent, Sang-mi. Pull over. Apostle Kang. I need to go, too. Welcome. I'm sorry, could we use your restroom? But you're not customers. We're members of Guseonwon. That's right! Spiritual Father's wife who sings with the voice of an angel. Oh, my, I'm not his wife. Yes, you are! So, where is your restroom? If you go out and turn the corner, it's right there. Thank you. No problem. Oh, madam, just a moment. Someone left their wallet here last time. Sang-mi, go ahead to the restroom. Here. No! Sang-mi... How is this a place of salvation and miracles? I'm not going! I'm going to live in the New Sky with Sang-jin. This is the New Sky! Sang-mi. Sang-mi, are you inside? Sang-mi? Sang-mi? -Sang-mi's not here, is she? -Start the engine. Goodness, what the... For goodness' sake. Excuse me, are you okay? Please... Please save me. Hey. Why are you avoiding me? -Feeling guilty about something? -We ain't avoiding you. You lot seem to be doing okay. Give it a rest. Honestly, we're the victims, too. What? We have to retake our exams because of what happened then. You at least transferred to Seoul and went to college. Have you quite finished? Sang-hwan, don't. Hey! You, listen up. It wasn't because of Dong-chul. It was all because of me. You got that? You got that? Yeah. Byung-seok is still in hospital because of Dong-chul. Excuse me, miss... do you know your guardian's phone number? Where's your home? I don't have one. Oh, my. Hello. What can I help you with? Oh, is that so? Sorry? Sure. Yes, of course. Goodbye. Who was it? Excuse me, miss. By chance, do you live at Guseonwon? For the love of God, open the door! Ma'am, please calm down! Goodness, what's gotten into her? Officer. You have to help me, please! -Please calm down! -For goodness' sake. Jeez, it's hot. It's okay now. You can step out. Look, officer... Guseonwon... Sang-mi! Sang-mi! How could you just disappear like that? I searched everywhere for you! You're this lady's father, right? Yes, that would be me. Sang-mi, your father was worried sick. Officer Woo, we're so grateful to you every time. Oh, please, it's nothing. I'll feel sad if you keep saying it like that. We're not strangers. That is right. We aren't strangers. Don't just stand there, hand her over. Of course. Thank you so much. Let's go. No! Officer, you have to help me. Sorry? These people... are murderers! Jeong-gu... They put Jeong-gu onto the railway tracks... -Oh, my... -On the railway tracks... What you said earlier was right. How could this young lady... What a shame. I hate to think what could have happened if we hadn't found her quickly. Please take extra care that she doesn't leave and cause any accidents, okay? You know what a dangerous world we live in. Sang-mi was there at the railway tracks, too. So, I guess the shock was worse for her. Oh, my goodness... Seeing a horrible accident like that in her already unstable mental state... Actually, she looks a similar age to my son. Miss. From now on, don't come outside, and stay at home. Okay? I'm not crazy. Dad! Say something! Say something! Sang-mi! Please. For the love of God... When you act like this... it breaks my heart so much. With what has happened to your mother, it can't happen to you, too. Please, you need to get it together! Dad. Everything you've seen are all lies made up by Satan! Why do you keep falling for Satan's traps? Satan is a liar! A murderer! Did you forget what the Spiritual Father said? -Sang-mi! -Sang-mi! Let go. Let go of me! -Sang-mi. -It's all because of you! My dad! My mom! It's all your fault! The Mighty New Sky. Please forgive me. This... This is all because my prayers were not enough. Dad. Please, just stop this! I'm going to go crazy if you carry on. The Mighty New Sky, who defeated the power of death with the blood of the lamb and resurrected, I believe in you! Sir, please don't do this here. Don't get involved in others' family affairs. Stay out of it. I believe in our savior, the Mighty New Sky! The Mighty New Sky! Please vanquish Satan from the body of my poor, pitiful daughter! Dad! I order you, in the name of the Mighty New Sky, evil Satan, leave my beloved daughter Sang-mi's body this instant! Leave! -Leave! -Leave her body! Leave! Leave! Leave! Leave! Leave my daughter's body! I earnestly cried out to the Mighty New Sky, and he has listened and will save you from all hardships. Do not worry. For the Mighty New Sky has, without a doubt, heeded our sincere prayer. We shall be blessed. I believe. -I believe. -I believe. Get her in the car. Sang-mi. This Satan fellow is scary! -Hey, Officer Choi. Don't you agree? -Yes? I think that she needs to go to the hospital to get examined... Those who are sick may go to hospitals, but those whose souls are sick, the Mighty New Sky is a skilled doctor for them. Goodness, thank you so much for rescuing Sang-mi, officer. It's nothing. -By the way... -Yes? How did you hurt your hand? I fell over whilst playing hide-and-seek with the children. You love kids so much! Why haven't you found a wife yet? What about Officer Choi here? -Stop it. -Don't say something so ridiculous. She needs someone way better than me. Anyway, I have much to do. Goodbye. Keep up the good work. Thank you so much, Officer Woo. Whoa, this Satan business is scary! You saw it, right? Sang-hwan. What's up with you today? Did you just practice your fighting skills in Seoul? Yeah, is something wrong? Today is the day... Dong-chul got out of prison. Did you know? That's why you're back, isn't it? Shall we try to go see him now? Please. In three years, he never once accepted my visits. You think he'd see us if we go now? Excuse me, corn refill over here! Refill? Order some food, you little cheapskates! Look, the country is in terrible condition right now, so the streets are filled with unemployed youths. We don't have any money. What? Condition? Cut me some slack! Go join the army or something, then! How have you boys not changed at all since high school? She's right. Nothing's changed... after all this time. ARABIAN I'll wake you when we arrive, so lie back down. Yes. Think of it as your mother's lap. Sang-mi. Don't you feel better after that prayer? You are the ones... who are Satan. The devil. Sang-mi. You're the same, Dad. You are also... the same as those people. Satan! My heart feels comfortable and happy at Guseonwon. Just going into town like this, my head hurts and my chest feels tight. I don't know how I did before. Dad... It's because of all the evil souls. This country is not fit for people to live in. It's full of evil. Protests everywhere, people slandering others. But we are the chosen ones. We should be so thankful. Yes. I'm so thankful we can prepare for these hard times. -We shall be blessed. -I believe. We shall be blessed. Nobody... is listening to me. Nobody. Oh, no. I'm so sorry! The roads are very dark. Are you hurt? I think both parties are to blame here. Our premiums will rise if you claim on insurance... Just a moment. Here... let's settle this quietly, yes? Sorry, sir. You seem to be quite unaware of the law. If a car driver hits a motorbike, the blame is 70 percent yours, and 30 percent mine. That's the court's precedent. But this is a one-way street. You came up here and rammed into us, so the blame lies 100 percent on you. How are both parties to blame here? You seem to be a college student. I guess you studied law. Okay, then. You should have said so. Here, yeah? Here, I am truly very sorry. Sir. If you're sorry, you should get out and apologize first. Of course. Yes, I should. My butt is rather heavy, is why. -You guys all right? -It hurts. Go home and get some ice on it. My goodness. Young kids these days talk so energetically, it seems. Right. Well, here. I'm truly, truly sorry. Is this all okay now? Excuse me. I apologize. We made a big mistake. I want to apologize once more. Right, going down an alleyway at that speed... I think I've dislocated my shoulder. Are you guys all right? Wow, this is severe. -I wasn't going to go that far... -Yes. ...but my father is a police officer. Shall I call him? Okay. Father... Since we made a mistake, it's right for us to compensate you. However, from the three of you... I think I can smell alcohol. Shall we go to your father's station for a breathalyzer test? Would that be okay? Well, we are also partly to blame. -Let's leave things here. -Yes. Seeing as we're all at fault here. -Right? -Yes. Save me.
