 Dong-chul. Dong-chul! I'm sorry! This isn't something we can treat with medication. She'll require long-term hospitalization. Long-term hospitalization, you say? By long-term, how long do you mean? With her condition, at least a few years, at most, she's looking at the rest of her life. For now, start the admission process. Jeong-gu. What are you doing over there? Come here for some soda and rice cakes. Soda? Yes, soda. Come on over here.

 Soda! Dad. What are we going to do with Mom? Sang-mi. If we take her to a hospital, they'll just lock her up in a mental institution. I cannot let her be sent to a prison like that. It's a place where even the sane go insane. Then how about going back to Seoul to find a hospital instead of... No. It's no use going to a hospital. Sang-mi, don't you worry. I will protect you and your mother no matter what happens. One more time! The Mighty New Sky! I shall live as the Mighty New Sky intends! We shall be blessed! Please save us from being blinded by lies, and that we don't fall into the fiery pits of hell when we finally see you! We shall be blessed! You're here. Welcome. Thank you. Young man, what are you waiting for? You should come in as you followed them here. Sang-jin... Is my Sang-jin here? He's over there. Sang-jin... In that world, they all fight, loathe, kill and spew hatred to one another. While they live like those in Sodom and Gomorrah, we here shall be waiting and preparing for the day of salvation from the Mighty New Sky! We shall be blessed! The gods of heaven and Earth who protect us have descended! Pitiful mankind should stop feeling sorrow, and should rejoice in high spirits! Do this together with us, so we can ride the Ship of Salvation away from this evil world! We believe! The Mighty New Sky! The Mighty New Sky! The Mighty New Sky! The Mighty New Sky! The Mighty New Sky! The Mighty New Sky! Please provide us all with the path to salvation! Please give me unwavering strength to eternally pray to you and to enter the New Sky with my brothers and sisters here by my side even if I must sacrifice everything! Please do this together with us! Your son is here. Mom. Stop it now. My arm hurts. Is that you, Sang-jin? Mom, I'm sorry I left you first. But you still have Dad and Sang-mi with you, so please cheer up and eat properly. Sang-jin... Sang-jin. Mom. I'll be just fine, so don't you worry. Take care of yourself. No, Sang-jin. Don't go. Sang-jin. Don't... Don't... Don't leave me. Don't go, Sang-jin! I have to go. The man there says I need to take the boat. No! Sang-jin. Sang-jin... Sang-jin. Sang-jin, don't go. Mom, we'll meet again another day. No! Mom's crying. Mom! No! Now I'm leaving. Don't worry about me. Live a long and healthy life. Sang-jin! Sang-jin! Sang-jin... -Mom! -Honey! Honey, are you okay? No. My son... Sang-jin is not dead. Sang-mi. Your brother is not dead, is he? He's not dead. Tell me, Sang-mi. Sang-jin's not dead, right? Hurry up and say it. Say it, Sang-mi! Sang-jin's not dead! Mom... Say it, Sang-mi! Honey! Stop this, okay? You saw it, too! You saw him at home, too! You saw it! Honey! You need to get it together! You saw Sang-jin at home! You saw it! You! Honey! Sang-jin's not dead! Sang-jin's not dead! You saw it! There's a real strong one attached to your wife. By any chance, is it my son? No. It's not your son. Then who? One with a mean temper. I'll fix a date next month and contact you. We'll try it once more then. And this... You have to make sure it's kept in her underwear without her knowing. It's the only way to make sure your daughter and wife don't follow your son to the afterlife. Transfer another large sum tomorrow. Sorry, wait... What do you mean? I need to be paid enough so I can do it effectively. Well, you see, sir, the money I sent you was everything I had, including my son's condolence money. Oh, dear, you... In that case, I'll do half price for you. Five grand. I can't go any lower than that. Thank you. The road is dark, be careful getting back. Goodbye. Spiritual Father, please rest. We can clear all this up. I'm quite all right. Did you take the elderly back to their homes? Spiritual Father, you think I don't know to do that? Apostle Jo, watch what you say. Why are you acting so cranky? I like everything about you, except your lack of humanity. We are the faithfuls, specially chosen by the Mighty New Sky. As we've been saved and reborn, you should also change how you carry your words. Yes, of course. I've been saved. Of course, I made sure the elderly were all tucked in, and also emptied their bedpans, Spiritual Father. All members of Guseonwon are equal here. Whether they be poor or powerless, please do not treat them any differently. Yes. Of course, Spiritual Father. Apostle Kang. Are you still taking care of Sang-mi's family? Yes. However, probably because she's in such shock, the mother doesn't seem to be mentally stable. It appears she's been to a few hospitals, but none of the treatment is working. She shall soon return to the Mighty New Sky's embrace. The Mighty New Sky also uses evil people to save the righteous, and blesses us with fortune through misfortune. We shall be blessed. Let me do this. MOOJI POLLING STATION Candidate Han, did you have any lucky dreams? I shall tell you later. You're running as a non-partisan without party support. Do you expect an unprecedented third-time win to be possible? I'm merely a servant working for the people. I'm confident the people know which servant is working the hardest for Mooji. Do you think that your father will win the election? I'm not really sure. Is that not the correct answer? Until the results are out, no one knows which way an election will go. Good day. Sir, I'm giving you a great price for it. It's an old model with high mileage. It hasn't got long left until it's for the scrapheap, anyway. Still... it was like a child to me. Sorry? Right. Okay, bye. Wait a minute! Is Saemaul on roids or something? He's really going for it today! He could win. Still, Bold Guy is holding out well, no? You think Dong-chul's doing okay? Dong-chul will hold out just fine like Bold Guy here. -Yeah! Bold Guy! -I knew it! Bold Guy wins! Dong-chul. Get in. Your eyes remind me of my son's. Sang-jin... I'm sorry. I didn't pay enough attention. You were suffering so much. I was oblivious. Have you been well? You haven't eaten yet, right? Hey, isn't this that place? Yeah, where that bully broke his back. But why did Dong-chul do that? You don't know? They were fighting over a girl who transferred from Seoul. Why? I hear she's that kind of girl. -That kind? What? -Yeah. -A whore. -For real? They say she was expelled from her school in Seoul for sleeping with older guys for money. Dig in. This is so nice. Right? Yes. Oh, my. Just a minute. We have to spray this first. What's that? Water of Life. It's holy water from the Fountain of Salvation that was blessed by the Spiritual Father. It has miraculous disease-curing abilities. Of course, it makes food taste good, too. I see. -You may eat now. -Sure. And this... Please give this to your wife and Sang-mi. They're probably having a hard time eating properly. Can I ask... Why are you being so nice to us? We have nothing to give in return. It's a revelation. -Sorry? -It's no coincidence that we crossed paths. Everything in the world is a revelation of the Mighty New Sky. We received a divine message from him telling us to help a brother who is going through hardships and treat him like family. The Mighty New Sky is no doubt sending you a revelation, too. It's just that we haven't been able to find it yet. So, please, look hard. GOVERNOR CONFIRMED We won! Yes! Han Yong-min! -Han Yong-min! -Thank you. Han Yong-min! Han Yong-min! Han Yong-min! Han Yong-min! MOOJI'S PRINCE CHARMING PULLS OFF MIRACLE WITH 3-TIME WIN! Sang-hwan's here! Let me shake your hand. -Awesome. -The son of the governor. He must be over the moon. Do not be afraid. For I am with you. Don't be scared. I shall be your god. I shall give you strength. I will do my best to help you. I will hold onto you with my righteous right hand. That's right. Everything is his revelation. It's fine. Don't worry about it. How... How did you know we were here? Please give me Seok Dong-chul's phone number. Dong-chul will be out of reach for some time. What do you mean? The thing is... How should I... Dong-chul... has been sent to juvie. What? Why has he gone there? It was my fault. This all happened... because of me. Hey, are you Seok Dong-chul? Why do you wanna know? It's customary to have a welcome party for newbies. This guy got the gold medal at the National Youth Athletics Festival. His hands pack a punch. Hey, you know something? Someone paid me to mess you up. Who? I'm back. Why are you so late? The teacher wanted to see me. Honey, Sang-mi's here, so let's go. Okay. Where are you going? Your mother and I are going somewhere. To meet Sang-jin. He said I can meet Sang-jin where we're going. Dad, if it's that place from last time, no way. You know Mom's condition worsened after we went there. We're not going there today. -Then where? -Guseonwon. Guseonwon? Sang-mi. I now understand. The reason we came here, the reason this happened to Sang-jin, and the reason this happened to your mother, too. This was all the Mighty New Sky's revelation. What are you talking about, Dad? I'm saying we've been chosen by the Mighty New Sky. Seriously, cut this nonsense! Instead of doing this, let's take Mom to a bigger hospital in Seoul, yeah? Sang-mi. The only place that can help her isn't a hospital. It's Guseonwon. Let's go and receive the Spiritual Father's prayer. You're lying. -What? -Don't lie to me. What do you mean? It's because of that woman. -Sang-mi. -I saw. I saw you with that woman! I'm scared. Those people creep me out! Sang-mi. Don't say such things. Those folk are special people who have been sent to save us. Dad. What's gotten into you? Sang-mi. I'm being truthful... when I tell you that this is all for you and your mother. So, please... I'm asking you to just... To just believe in me one more time. Dad. Let's go to Sang-jin. GUSEONWON Hello. Everything's okay. Soda. Jeong-gu likes soda. Oh, my. Why, what's this, Jeong-gu? You're giving her a soda? He's our angel here at Guseonwon. He loves soda so much that he doesn't give it to anyone but his Grandma. Why, our Jeong-gu is a man, too. Knows a pretty girl when he sees one. Sang-jin... Sang-jin. Sang-jin. Right. Sang-jin, yes. The Spiritual Father is waiting, let's go on up. -Okay. -Sang-jin... Make sure you hide, I can see your hair. Make sure you hide, I can see your hair. Make sure you hide, I can see your hair. Found you. THREE YEARS LATER, 2017 Excuse me. You have such a bright aura. We can see you're very blessed from your face. Your ancestors must be looking favorably on you. Let us share some words of wisdom over a cup of tea. Wait, if you could just... A motorbike riding on the shoulder of a three-lane road and sidewalk slams into the back door of a parked taxi that opens suddenly. Afterwards, he files a lawsuit against the Private Taxi Transport Association, and the court rules that the association is responsible for 70 percent of the damage, and the motorbike rider, 30 percent of the damage. Do any of you think there's a problem with the court ruling, that the blame lies more heavily on the taxi? Yes, girl in the red shirt. If you go downtown, you can see motorbikes often weaving in and out of traffic and not sticking to the lanes, which has put many drivers in dangerous situations. Therefore, I believe that this ruling could actually encourage bikers to travel on the shoulder instead of in the lanes, which is more dangerous. I see. Anyone else have a different opinion? Yes, over there. In this case, I think that the court ruling that puts the majority of the blame on the taxi driver is just. However, I think the bigger problem is how the passenger who opened the door wasn't included as a defendant. The motorbike rider only sued the association. Had the passenger also been one of the defendants, both the passenger and the association would've shared responsibility in compensating the biker. And if that happened, I think there is a possibility the association could later sue the passenger, too. Hey, Han Sang-hwan. You better come to the end of semester party today, okay? Hey, wait. I was told to make sure that everyone comes tonight. Okay? Nice to meet you. Hey, you. Why haven't you been drinking? I'm not great with alcohol, you see. What? I can't handle my drink. Drink, kiddo. Drink up. Hey, I said drink up! Drink, you little... Help him. Please help my brother. You said you'll take care of it yourself. Okay... Hey. Don't drink it. Who'd want to drink something filled with your spit? And this is coercion under Article 324 of the Penal Code. -What? -Threatening to obstruct someone's rights, or make them do something they're not obliged to... is punishable by up to five years in prison or a 30-million fine. Who is this crazy kid? Hey! Where's the freshman rep? Here. I'm here. -Is it you? -Yes. These insolent kids are taking liberties because you're not doing your job properly! Do you want assault to be added to coercion? -Let go. -Hey, what are you doing? Are you insane? Let go! Are you okay? Hey! If this kiddo won't drink it, then you should have it before you leave. There is no discipline. Sang-hwan. How have you held it all in this far? What's this? This kid's from the countryside? Right, then... I'm exercising self-defense. You little... Don't just make a lame attempt. Come at me, all at once. What will you do on the outside? I've got to work and live as best I can. Now that you've got a clean new cut, live as if you're reborn. Easy now, easy. To the side a moment. Good, good. Right, slowly, now. That's it. Great. Easy, now. Take it slow. Easy, now. Take it slow. Yes, very good. Hello, Congressman Park. I'm sorry that I haven't come to visit in a while. It's quite all right. You must be so busy after becoming the party's top congressman. We're taking good care of your father, so you've no need to worry. Father. I'm here. Aren't you a friend of my son's? It's me, Young-chul. Your son. I should visit here more frequently so I can see more of you, Apostle Kang. Shall we have dinner together sometime? How is your health holding up? Since using the Water of Life you gave me, I'm sleeping much better now. Proof that the Mighty New Sky loves you, congressman. His grace. Right? His grace! Thanks to you, congressman, Mooji is also seeing a lot of development. WITHDRAW NURSING HOME APPROVAL SHAME ON YOU FOR TOYING WITH THE PEOPLE Hey. You're the governor's son, right? You've got the wrong person. Come visit us sometime. I'll give you some extra on the house. Okay? Is that Sang-hwan? It's been a while. His face is so pale. Hey! Sang-hwan! Hello! -Hey! -Drink up! Just you wait. Hey! Die! You! Hey, why do you guys spray water at me? What's up, Sang-hwan? -You still do video streaming? -Of course! My views are through the roof. -Why, I ought to just... -Anyway, how long's it been? -Must have been nearly three years, right? -Three years... Anyway, how did you know I came back? Mooji's source of all information, Pil-soo, told us. Says he saw you at the terminal while on a delivery. This town is too small. Hey, man, you should have brought some nice Seoul girls with you if you're coming back down here. Isn't that right, Man-hee? Man-hee. Are you ignoring me right now? Yeah, I am. Don't move. Ten-hut. At ease. Ten-hut. At ease. Drop down, face to the floor. Give them back. How dare you ignore me. Jeez, you two haven't changed a bit. Do it. Hand them over. They shouldn't be noisy. They'll get in trouble. I like soda. Hide and Seek? Make sure you hide, I can see your hair. I found you! SONG JI-EUN They're fighting. You mustn't fight. It's bad. Mister. Mr. Wan-tae. Jeong-gu likes soda. Oh, my... Mister. Soda. Jeong-gu likes soda. Sang-mi. Come on, you showed us your junk last time. What's to be embarrassed about? This kiddo's wet himself! Sang-mi. Jeong-gu! What do you think you're doing? It's not what you think. Jeong-gu here stole some money. Don't give me that nonsense. You know full well he'd never do such a thing! You don't know that. You never know. Jeong-gu could be acting right now. If you hit him one more time... then I'll seriously report you to the police. Sang-mi. What are you saying? You make it sound as if I hit people often. Don't take me for a fool. Well, it seems you've greatly misunderstood something. I did not beat him, I simply spanked him to make sure he doesn't do this again. In fact, Jeong-gu is the person I adore the most in all of Guseonwon. Why would I beat him for no reason? Isn't that right, Jeong-gu? Jeong-gu, I guess you're triggering her maternal instinct, because she's holding you tight. Let's go and change your clothes. Careful. Sang-mi. What happens in Guseonwon gets resolved in Guseonwon. You know that, right? Goodbye, Jeong-gu. Jeong-gu is severely hurt. We need to take him to a hospital right now. We shall be blessed. Sang-mi. You do know this is our period of silence, no? You did this. Sang-mi, mind your manners! How many times must I say? Address him as "Apostle Jo." Yes, Sang-mi. Instead of going to the hospital, he'll get better if we give him some Water of Life. We shall be blessed. Dad! Sang-mi. The Spiritual Father's blessed Water of Life can even cure cancer. This is nothing! One drop of it will heal him completely! That's right, Sang-mi. Let's heal him with faith. Do all of you... really believe that? Do you honestly believe... -ordinary water can manufacture miracles? -Sang-mi. How can you say something evil like that? Repent! Dad! Please, wake up. Jeong-gu doesn't need that plain water, he needs a hospital! Until when... Until when I need to wait? It's been three years! You kept saying, "just one year." But it's been three! Look at Mom. How is this a place of salvation and miracles? Sang... Sang-mi. -I... -You've lost it. Living here like this... It's insane! All of you here are insane, too. Salvation? Eternal life? You really think that's possible living in a place like this? Please... I beg you, just wake up. Sang-mi. We can't have any more of this. Apostle Jo, please escort her to the oratory. We shall be blessed. Let's go pray. Sang-mi? -Let go. -Let's pray. -Let go of me! -Go to the hospital. If someone is hurt, then... you should of course take them to hospital, no? If one does not have faith, then just as Sang-mi says, this is nothing but ordinary water. If you don't believe, yet pretend it's working because of those around you, then that is the greatest sin. Everything here must look fake to you. However, you, too, shall soon realize... that this place is real... and the outside world... is the fake one. What are you saying to him? You're quite on edge, Sang-mi. Jeong-gu is family to me. Is it wrong of me to simply ask how he is feeling? I think Jeong-gu's ready to be discharged. Excuse me. You're discharging him? Jeong-gu isn't in any pain. Jeong-gu misses Grandma. Okay, let's go. We're out of gas? Fill up at that gas station. Sang-mi, I'm going to take a leak. Are you cold, Jeong-gu? Jeong-gu is scared. You're scared? That man is scary. He hit Jeong-gu. You mustn't swear. The lady kept telling him it hurt, but he hit her again. She was screaming. Jeong-gu, what are you talking about? He didn't only hit you, but also, another person? Hitting people makes you bad. That man is a bad person. He'll kill us if we talk. He will kill me and Grandma. Look, Jeong-gu's favorite, soda. I bought it specially for you because you're such a good boy. Nice, right? Soda. I like soda. Now, why would you be tightly clutching a phone that doesn't even work? Drive smoothly. We have a patient back there. Take it easy over bumps. Speed bumps are there so you reduce your speed. SAVE ME The one who believes me, who was resurrected... Of course. Our Spiritual Father is the resurrection and the life. Those who believe in the Spiritual Father shall never die. Drink plenty of water with it.
