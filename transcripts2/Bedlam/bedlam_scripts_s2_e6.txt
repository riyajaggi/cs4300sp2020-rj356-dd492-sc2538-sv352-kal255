 You know when you saw your dad... I knew he was a revenant. Were you scared? I knew he was trying to tell me something. And I never understood what it was. These people hurt you, didn't they? Tell me what they did, Eve. Joseph Bell's badge of membership, so he knew who he could trust. He knew who was in on the abuse. Ellie's got that same B on her shoulder. Argh! Why say something like that?! Joseph took a child, a baby. He must have kept the baby until she was a girl.

 That's why I keep seeing Eve. That's why she's so scared of him. Kate! Joseph! I know who Eve is. Who? Me. Eve... Dad? Dad? Subtitles by MemoryOnSmells http://UKsubtitles.ru. Support Us and Donate. Ellie? I just saw my dad. What? I just saw my dad in my room. Where are you going?

 Yeah, I was... I was gonna knock on your door but I didn't want to disturb you. How do you think sneaking out wouldn't disturb me? At least you don't have to write something witty in the leaving card. I spoke to my friend Laura. I can stay with her until I find something. Is this about the abortion? No. Max, I just want to get on with my life. Eve was trying to tell me who I am and now I know. You don't know why it happened. Or why Joseph kept you hidden. No. I know enough. Good for you. My dad, who's been dead for 15 years, was just sitting on my bed. You have to tell me what he wants. I don't know why I'm doing this, Max. That wasn't there before. Look at that. I lost this. This is unreal. Is that your dad? Yeah. He left this for me, and before... he left this. He was wearing this when he was killed. The hospital gave it to me. I never look at this. Not any more. I know I told you I saw him right after he died. He was sat on my bed exactly the way he was just now. I mean... Is he here now? No. Please. Max... Even if you can't see him, it might spark off something. I know. Listen, I think that... maybe you wanted this to happen a bit too much. Your dad was never in the asylum. But then you thought you'd never been here - Sorry. I can't help you. I don't want to get your hopes up. It's a bit late for that. I've been wanting this every day since I was eight years old. I hardly have any pictures of the two of us. I think this is the only one. I'm glad you've found it again. I didn't just find it, did I? I'm just saying. It's a precious picture. Maybe that's all it is. Ellie, there was no reason for this to turn up like that. Look, I don't want to put any pressure on you. Just... hold it in your hands. I mean... See what happens. Don't be afraid of letting me down. I can hold the end if it helps. Not really. Yeah? No. Are you sure? Very. Let's try something else, yeah? Where have you been? He had a blackout. He didn't know I was there. 'He just... He just got up and started walking.' There's these tunnels under the building. I followed him and... I think I saw Kate. How? Has someone hurt her? I don't know if it was her body. What? It just looked like her. You saw a body? You've got to call the police. I need to be sure about what I saw. What happened to your dad? You're probably going to find out in a new seconds. Max, I'm sorry. Nothing. Give it a try. I don't want to see any more ghosts or have more visions! Is that why you're running away? I just found out I spent the first years of my life in a cage by some twisted sadist! Wouldn't you want to run? Please. Max, I can't. I'm sorry. OK. You got what you wanted. I am happy for you. Liar. I'll just get the rest of my stuff. Eve... You still shouldn't go. Max... I'm not asking you to stay for me. You owe it to yourself. You wanted answers and you won't be satisfied until know everything. It's just the way you are. I am satisfied. You're braver than that. Am I? Yeah. I spent six months seeing ghosts before I did anything about it. And you gave up your life to come here. I was suspended from my job. Even so, you still chose to be here. It didn't feel like a choice. Neither does this. I don't think you've thought this through. Thanks for your concern. And when there's no one to talk to about anything that matters? Great pep talk, Max. She's dead. It's all my fault. What happened? Warren? Why did you go to that place? I saw you. I dunno. I had a blackout. You knew she was there. Did you put her there? What? Warren, did you kill her? No. Of course not. I'd never harm my own daughter. You just said, "It was my fault." Why? Why was it your fault? Warren, I told you the truth about me. It was Joseph! Who's Joseph? Joseph Bell. He worked here. In the hospital? He was an evil, evil man. Warren, that was 20-odd years ago. He made people think he could communicate with the dead. And he used it to terrorise them. Not just the inmates. He's come back for revenge. Revenge for what? You wouldn't understand. He did some terrible, terrible things. So why didn't you stop him? When I found out, I did stop him. But it was too late. Too late for what? And this is definitely him? It must be. I thought he was dead. So how could it be him? How do you know? Cos this is what he does! Warren, this doesn't make sense. He kills girls. You're not leaving? Yeah. Why? Well, it was only supposed to be temporary. Has Warren said something to upset you? Like what? Has he spoken to you? What exactly are you getting at? If he has... It was me who told him you've got the same symbol he has on his arm. Sorry? I apologise if I spoke out of turn. I didn't think it was a big deal but the way he reacted was weird. What did he say about me? It was the way he reacted. What did he say about me? Nothing. I don't believe you. You know what, I want to hear it for myself. Max? Are you OK? Warren's got that brand like I have. He's part of that secret circle. And you know this how? He's been talking to Keira about me. He knows something. I must be in a file here somewhere. Right. What were you expecting to find, Ellie? I don't know. Notes about myself, a photograph, something. But why would he keep evidence? It was all about covering up, secrecy. But Warren might not have known about you. Keira said he acted weird when she mentioned me. Warren and weird go hand in hand. She wouldn't have mentioned me unless she was freaked out. He was angry because she stumbled across something that he thought nobody would ever find out about, except his mates. His mates? The ones with the B symbol. They were all in it, terrorising patients and keeping each others' secrets. Right. So this symbol is for abusers to identify each other, yeah? Why have you got it? Maybe they liked to mark their own property. I don't know. What are you doing, Max? Oh, my God. If this is my dad... why is he trying to scare the hell out of me? Is that what I think it is? I think it's my father's ashes, yeah. Bingo. OK? I don't want to push you here but is he with us? I mean, now, can you see him? No. But you had a vision, yeah? What... What was it? The accident? Was it Eve? But you saw my dad? No, Max, I didn't see anyone. You saw something, Ellie. What was it? I don't know! You do know! A place. OK. A place. That narrows it down a bit. Where was it? I don't know. Like a passageway, like a dark place with a... A pillar like a... I don't know. Like a sundial. OK, where was it? I don't know, Max. Ellie, please. We're going to run in circles. Just... Just try to remember. Outside. Outside in the grounds. What are you doing? Getting stuff. We've never needed stuff before. Yeah? We've never been looking for my dad before. You coming? I-I can't. I don't think I can do this, Max. Why? You need to go on your own. If your dad wants to get through to you, then he will. I'm sorry, but this is nothing to do with me. How can you say that? Why hasn't he showed himself to you again? He knows you're waiting. He knows I've got someone who can help me. Maybe that's why he came today. Cos he knows I'm gonna lose you. I think we might be close. Max, this is it. That's the sundial that I saw in my vision. I could see it in the distance. What do you mean? Where did you see it from? I dunno. It felt like it was from here. You alright? It's Eve. She's here now. She's standing right in front of us. Why is she here? I thought she did what she came for. Eve, I know who I am. I know I'm you. I don't know. Maybe she wants something. What is it you want, Eve? We've got to keep moving. I know you want to find your dad but this isn't just about him. Eve, if you want something, I can try to help you. But you can't keep following me around for the rest of my life. Ellie... What? There's a door. In your vision you came out of the darkness into the light? Yeah. Max, try the key. Ellie... You ready? Ellie? You found him? Yeah. Kate? Oh... Um... Um... What happened to her? He said... He told me there was someone called Joseph who used to work in the asylum He says he's come back. And he's saying this man killed Kate? Warren says he's after revenge. Revenge? What for? I don't know. He knows it's revenge but he doesn't know why. That's what he's saying. And what are you saying? Cos I know what I'm saying. You can't seriously believe him? I don't know. Just because he's fed you some bullshit story. He's lost his mind and... and killed her. And you called the police? No, not yet. Why not? No, don't you go all weird on me as well. Wait. Wait for what? She wasn't just the boss's daughter. I... I've known her since she was a little girl. She's been murdered. I'm sorry. I'll do it. OK? I'll call them now. Will you stop doing that? What am I doing? Looking at me. How can you tell? I can just feel it. Sorry. I just wondered whether you - I know you are. And? No, nothing. Shh! Can you hear that? Whoa! Shit! Be careful, Ellie. I saw this in my vision. Yeah? Follow me. I can't hear it any more. It doesn't make sense. Your dad had no connections to the asylum. I don't know that for sure. He'd hardly have told me if he had, right? We know he didn't die here. So? The visions only show how people died. I know he's here, Ellie. I can just feel it, you know. OK. Ellie? I know you're here, Dad. Max... Dad? Max? Max? Max? Max! Max! Dad? Dad, it's me. It's Max. Hello, Max. It's really... It's you. I've been waiting for you. I've been waiting since I was little. You came and sat on my bed... I'm sorry I've been away for so long. I knew you'd come back. Everyone thought I was crazy but I knew you wanted to be with me. Of course. I love you. Love you too, Dad. Dad. She's mine. Max? No, Daddy. No, Daddy! You haven't called the police, have you? I've just found out... my friend is dead. I need you to not be like this. She looked up to him. She wanted to be like him. How can you think he deserves protecting because he's your boss? OK? OK, maybe you think he can't be capable of something like that. Well, this... This is what he did to me yesterday. Look at it! What other evidence do you need, Dan? Why are you so convinced he didn't do it? He's my dad. - What? - Dan! Dan! Ellie's in danger. She's in the tunnels. Joseph's got her. I need to find Warren. I've looked everywhere. Why do you need Warren? He knows the layout of the building. I'll help you look. OK? Still think he's innocent? Police. Warren! No! Warren? Don't. Please, Warren, don't. Whoever your stepfather is, he's a better man than I am. That's not true. You want to know who your real dad is? A lifelong coward. He thought he could suddenly come back, make a brave new start. My daughter paid the price. You've got me. A few weeks ago I'd have pushed you over myself. I hated you for not knowing about me. Warren... I want to be in your life. You owe me that. This place has changed me. I'm no good to you. Ellie's in danger. No, she is. You have to come. I've called the police. Have you tried his mobile? Answerphone. His car's still here. Warren, no! Oh, God! Go, go, go! We can't find her! She's down in the tunnels! Joseph... Why the hell didn't you say? I'm coming with you. You are not to follow me. You're gonna need me. No! I've already lost one child to that man. I'm not going to lose you too. Oh, your heart's racing, I can feel it. Be calm. How do I keep seeing you? Killing me just made me more powerful. You can do what I can do. Just like your brother Jed. My brother? The living, the dead. For the likes of us, there's no barrier. Please, just let me go. Please. I never doubted that you'd come back, not for a minute. Why did you take me when my mother died? What else was a father to do? You're my father? Shh. I fed you, sang to you. Some nights you slept on my chest. That newborn smell. Mmm. Mmm, it's still there underneath. But you're not my father. Now I am. You're my flesh. What could I do? Huh? Let you grow up with no one to love you? There's no need to worry. All that's behind you now. Keira, Dan's on the roof. Go to him. He needs you. Why? Just go. Show me where you saw Ellie. I know who she really is. I know what this is about. We've got to stop Joseph. Outside. Which is the quickest way down? I saw him. I saw Joseph. He tried to kill me. He put a plastic bag over my head. How come he's... I mean, look, he's dead, yeah? He didn't look like a ghost or behave like one! When you've seen what he can do, then you'll know what he is. Come on Are you OK? He really wanted to help Ellie. What does that prove? He feels so bad for bringing Kate to live here. I should say his guilt is needed. An employee from 20 years ago tried to suffocate me. I thought you might be a bit surprised! He's done worse. Nice. Why did he attack me, though? To get me out of the way so he could get to Ellie? It doesn't make sense. Warren! What? You know about her, don't you? You know what happened to her when she was a baby. Why did they bring her down here, Warren? I didn't know it was her. It was a long time ago. See, I think you do know. I would have believed you before. I don't care what you believe. Did you ever care about her? Or did you just stand by and watch as Joseph took her from her mother? Did you know who she was when she got here? You wanna save her or not? I worked hard to get this place just the way you liked it, Eve. Stop calling me Eve. My name's Ellie. I named you Eve. I'm Ellie. I made you. I'd had a hard life before you brought comfort to it. I never meant to. Hey, I know what to do. Let's swap memories. Good girl. Joseph! Joseph, for God's sake, let her go. You knew and you let him do this to me! No, Ellie, I didn't. I didn't know you were Eve. Warren, awful to hear about Kate. I'm gonna kill you. Properly this time. You took Eve. Remember the rule that kept the scum in check? An eye for an eye... You didn't need an excuse. I know about Zoe. All the other girls who disappeared. Losing Eve left a hole in my life. And it turned out no one could take her place. Don't you dare put that down to me! You were at it years before she was born. Get that knife away from her. Put it down now. Your dad died after 43 minutes, the steering column through his pancreas, begging for you, your mum and for death. In that order. Is that really what you wanted all these years? Ellie! Get out! Now! Ellie, come on! This is the end, Joseph. You OK? Don't be afraid. I've come to get you out of here. What was he, Ellie? A ghost? Human? 'I don't know.' I killed you. How did you come back? Warren saved me when I was a little girl. He rescued me from Joseph. So he wasn't one of them? Warren Bettany? I'm Dan. I'm his son. I've seen him. He's in the basement through the door in the outhouse. Go I knew Joseph was my dad before he told me. I could just see it in my vision. Pure evil. That's what I came from. It's OK. It's OK, yeah? Is this him? Can you confirm this is Warren Bettany? Sir? I'm sorry about your dad. He was spot on. I just wanted it too much. Well, don't give up hope. He'll come. How's that gonna happen without you around? Just trust your instincts. You'll know when it's real. Oh, my God, it's Warren. Not Joseph. I found a suicide note on him. He's left all this to me. Why would Warren commit suicide? He didn't. Joseph did this. He's still out there. I'm the only one who can stop him. I'm gonna make him wish he never had a daughter. Are you staying? You coming? Yeah. Subtitles by MemoryOnSmells http://UKsubtitles.ru. Support Us and Donate.
