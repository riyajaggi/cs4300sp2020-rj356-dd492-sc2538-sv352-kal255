 You haven't earned it yet. Ho! Ho! Huh... Bring it on. Bring it on! Adriano_CSI www.addic7ed.com What are you up to? Just sorting out some photos and stuff I don't need. What brought this on? Oh, my God. Is that you? Was that haircut fashionable? Give me that. Did they have scissors then? At least I didn't have imaginary friends Searing wit. Cutting sarcasm. What do you want, Max?

 Did you talk to Dan? Have you decided what... Have you been to the hospital? I had an abortion last week. I was gonna tell you, but... I dunno. I decided to do it on my own. Are you OK? Yeah. Sorry I didn't tell you. I understand. It's up to you, right? I did the right thing. Look at the mess my life is in. It was the only decision. Of course it was. You didn't have to go through it on your own. I know. It was... It was just easier that way. Call that a kick? Come on. We're in. Where is he? I don't know but this place is weird. Come on, then. Let's just see what he wants. No! Well, look at this. Finally have someone living here who actually buys food. Better than that - I am making us all Sunday lunch. That's a result. Max... Oh, my God, they are so shagging. They're not, actually. See the way he jumps every time she claps? Poor old Max is stuck in the friends zone. Nothing is going to happen but it doesn't stop him hoping. Well, what about me and you? Or are we pretending that didn't happen? No. We're cool. We are? You've been avoiding me since we screwed each other's brains out and I wouldn't want things to be awkward now we're flatmates. Fair enough. Neither do I. I'm here whenever you want me. What does that mean? Look, I'm having a shit time, I've got no money and my parents have disowned me because they think I'm a slut. I don't need mind games with guys like you. I need friends. Like proper friends. Think you can manage that? Yeah. Good. It was a vicar, definitely. He was scared, terrified. But it wasn't in the asylum, it was in a church. There are no churches here. But what if the patients used to go to one near here? Maybe one of them died here. There's a church nearby. You're not wasting time. The quicker we act, the quicker solve things. Then maybe no one gets hurt this time. Don't you dare be late for lunch. Yes, Mum. Where did he say? Somewhere in this building. What is he doing here? God knows. Have I got something to show you two? Why the hell did you ask us to come here, you nutter? Can I help you? Um, yeah, we were just looking for a venue for our wedding. How lovely. Hm. We are a rather popular spot. You could be looking at least a year's wait. That is a shame. We really like it, don't we? We just have received a cancellation that's a mere two months away. That sounds perfect. I just need to have a word with my fiance. What the hell are you doing? Just trying to get him on side. This isn't the place. Are you sure? Yes. Oh. What are we gonna do about... I'm sorry, Max, I don't love you any more. I'm leaving you for Benjy. The wedding's off. I mean, I always knew something was going on with her and Benjy. The local asylum patients used to come here? No, no, never. But then, they had their own chapel. Thank you. I read this place was haunted but I didn't know there was a chapel. It's perfect. For what? For conducting the rite of blasphemy! And you wonder why people think you're a bit odd. I don't care what people think. Yes, you do. Good to see you again. It's been a while. Come on, you nut job. Let's get out of here. No, no, I'm staying here. I'm gonna perform the ritual, film it, stick it on the internet and prove the existence of evil. Did you hear that? Did you hear that? I seriously think there's something in here. Just ignore him as a wind-up merchant. I'm for real. Come on, all this satanic stuff, sticking two fingers up to your dad. The vicar is dead and he hasn't gone to heaven because it doesn't exist. No. See? There's definitely something in here. That's enough. The joke is over. Come on, let's just go. No, I'm not going anywhere. Alright, I'll stay with you. What? I'm not going down those freaky corridors on my own. Hey, hey, chill. Yeah? Let's stay here and do the ritual together. Come on. This... is going to be fun. It's about time we had a chat. Hardly said a word to me all week. Why don't we go for a beer? We're just about to eat. Oh. Well, maybe another time. You know what, why don't you join us? Now we know there's a chapel here, it can't be hard to find. I'm glad we got out of that one. We could've ended up married. That wouldn't have been such a bad thing. Yeah, it would. I think it's amazing how easy it was. We totally had that vicar fooled. We'd have a lovely wedding. You in a white dress, frills, little bridesmaids running around. I was supposed to be married not that long ago. You're better off without him. Max... It's true. I've never met the guy but he refused to stand by you when you really needed him. That's a bit unfair. Is it? He thought I was losing my mind. Not everyone is as open-minded about the supernatural as you are. I would never have left you, no matter what you were going through. You'll make a lovely husband one day. You can have your big naff wedding on one condition. Yeah, what's that? I can be a bridesmaid. And wear one of those big, pink, horrible, cheesy dresses. Deal? Deal. Well, it's completely inedible. You don't need to tell me. No. No, it's not bad. Well, this is cosy. I'm sorry. If I sent a text to your father, it was an accident. I never meant for him to find out. Do you realise the situation I'm in? How could I have been so stupid? I'd like to help. If you let me look after you... This isn't the '50s. Jesus. That's not what I meant. Just... if you wanted to move in. Yeah. That would really please my parents. Anyway, she's happy here, aren't you, Keira? I don't know. I haven't decided yet. Please come and join us before I kill someone. We'd love to but... Uh. You're joining us, now. We'll have to look later. That was Keira's first roast dinner. You'd never have known. Alright, give it a rest. I know it was foul. Don't be so hard on yourself. Who asked you? Keira, come on. Maybe things have changed. Maybe you should accept that. Er... What have you two been up to? Went for a walk, didn't we? Must have been a long walk. Yes, it was a lovely walk. It was up a hill... and then we ran into your friend Benjy. Oh, yeah, Benjy! I see you haven't told them. No, I haven't. You haven't told people about your illegitimate Asian son. We need to go and find that chapel, remember? You're not exactly in a hurry. I'm ready to tell the world when you are Well, I'm not. Not yet. I thought you wanted this. Don't rush me. This is complicated stuff. It's going to take a while. Did you invite me in just to embarrass me? I'll see you in the office tomorrow. Have a good day. Right, let's chill until the sun sets, then we begin. You don't really want to do this, do you? You just wanted us here. And you came, didn't you? Did you hear that? If you're trying to scare us, you're doing a pretty shit job. I dunno. It's nothing. That bloke was right. This place is weird. There's something here. Don't you want to help me prove it? Will you stop talking like that? Look. See, it's just an old font. Big deal. Yeah? That's where they used to baptise babies. Poor bastards. Stop it, Liam. You're giving me the creeps. Trust me, this is our one chance... You don't believe it yourself. You're such a wind-up merchant. There's evil in the world. Where do you think it lives? Places like this I think it lives in your head. You won't say that once I've summoned the spirit. Yep, whatever, weirdo. Shit! Right, we gonna do this, or what? I don't know what we're looking for. A stained glass window or a steeple. I don't know. Um... Listen... I just got an errand to run. Yeah? Mex! Five minutes. Promise. OK, you've completely lost it. I'm having no part of this. Au contraire, mon capitan! So you're gonna upload it to all the geeks on the internet. What are you trying to prove? That religion is a lie. That the Bible is propaganda. You know what, if God does exist, he's a manipulative bastard that lets human beings drown in tsunamis, perish in tornados, get murdered, and languish in poverty. And what for? What for? Nothing. There is no God! There is just evil and malevolence. And what is what we're here to celebrate. All of us. Aren't we? Liam... Let's go home, yeah? If you do it with me, yeah. No way, I'm not doing this! Oh... Did the nasty ghost scare you? There is no ghost. Then you've got nothing to worry about. Come on, man. Simple. We just recite the Lord's Prayer in negative. Our Dark Lord, who art in hell. Our Dark Lord, who art in hell. Our Dark Lord, who art in hell. Hideous be thy name. I'm sorry, I can't... Hideous be thy name. Thy will be done. Thy torment come. Say it! Alright. Thy will be done, thy torment come. In hell, as there is no heaven. Give us... You're going to get yourself killed. It's not funny any more! What the hell was that?! We are done here. We're leaving! Alright. You bloody idiot! I got what I wanted. I got it on film. You are out of your mind. Come on, we did it. Do you know what I mean? Told you he'd try something even if we tried. You don't know what you're messing with. This is totally not funny. Alright, I'm done. We're cool. Let's have another beer, smoke another spliff. Give me that. You alright, Taylor? You look like you've seen a ghost, mate. Come on, let's go home. What is it?! I need a piss. Go an have one, then. Unless you're too scared. I think your boyfriend is scared. What are we going to do with you, Liam? I'm having a piss. Why don't you get lost? You're not on shift tonight. I know. So, what are you doing here? You meeting someone? Silver bullet. You knew I was looking to shut that blog down! You knew it affected business! You work here! And you're making fun of me! That's not how it was. I'm not interested! You have three days to get your stuff and you're out. I'm not the only one with secrets. Yeah? Let me get this straight. You talked Warren into thinking you're his son? This is about money. Correct me if I'm wrong. You've no right listening to private conversations. I wasn't listening. I was by the door and you've got a loud voice. I mean, Jesus, what are you up to? It's true. He is my father. Of course he's not. How could he be? He just is, alright. He had a fling with my mum. Sorry to point out the obvious but you don't look like each other. You're a totally different colour. Wow. I know it's hard for you in your cosy white world to understand but you can have parents of different races. My mum was Asian. My father, as it turns out, is not. So you've always known about this. My mum died last year. She told me at the end. I always thought my dad was my dad. Turned out he wasn't. Maybe no bad thing. He's a scumbag anyway. God, this is massive. How come you wanted to find Warren? I dunno. I just wanted to know who he was. Then sometimes I want to take everything he has. I want him to pay for what he did. I'm not a psychiatrist but it doesn't sound terribly healthy. Yeah, I can see that. I'm not sure what I'm really doing half the time. I've done some pretty mental stuff. Look... Don't tell anyone. Not yet. Yeah. "You're gonna get yourself killed!" Uh-uh. My head's spinning. I think we've been rumbled. Good, cos we need to get out of here. You look really beautiful. Oh, shut up. You do. You always look beautiful. Hey, stay here a minute. Don't move. Don't move. No, I'm being serious. I really don't like this place. What happened to you? You used to be so much fun. Liam. He's tamed you. We were 17... and we needed to grow up. Did we? This isn't about me and you know it. It is. Our Father... Spirit's returned. Stop the games. It's not me. Who art in heaven... Liam, make it stop. Taylor should be back by now. Taylor! Hallowed is your name... Taylor... Taylor! Taylor! Taylor! Where are you? Our Father, who art in heaven We've got trespassers. I found them on Twitter. Have you just seen something? Look. What are they up to? What's the essay? The Oedipus Complex in a post-Freudian society. Sorry I asked. No, it's fascinating. Oedipus was this guy who killed his dad - Yeah. I know who Oedipus was. Is this you pretending to be my friend? I'm not pretending. Really? I don't think a friend would have humiliated me the way you did. Why did you invite him in? You know how things are between us. What happened to you not playing games? It wasn't... I saw your face. You were loving it. I'm sorry. You're right. I was just trying to get at Warren. I don't know why. You can't stand him, can you? It's complicated. Yeah, tell me about it. I don't know what to do about him. Do you like him? I did. I thought I did. Now it's all got so... weird. I know it is. Come on, it's ridiculous, right? It's got to stop. I need to tell him it's over, don't I? I should probably get going. I've an essay to write tonight. Come on, stay for a bit. No, really I can't. Sorry. Ellie's got that same B on her shoulder. What did you say? What did you say? Your tattoo. She's got the same one. I mean, it's fainter but it's the same design. Oh! Why would you say something like that? Let go of me! Who told you to say that?! You're hurting me! What the hell's wrong with you? Just leave me alone. All of you! Is this the place? The chaplain saw something he shouldn't have. I wonder if that's why he was killed. What did he see? I don't know. Come on. A black mass. I hope we're not too late. I'm really stoned. Where is Taylor? Did you hear that? I... I'm just... I'm just really stoned. No, it's not in your head. It's real. Will you stop talking like that? What's happening to us? Why did you bring us here? What happened to your dad, it was awful. But it's been a year and you need to move on. Screw you. Liam, what's that smoke? Our Father... I knew we shouldn't have come here. We shouldn't have walked into that chapel. It was wrong. Who are you? Come out. Come on. Stop it, stop it. I'm not scared! Religion's bullshit! My dad claimed to be a man of the cloth but he beat me so hard I had bruises on my legs for three months! I was seven years old when he started! Seven years old! Liam, your father said sorry before he died. He begged you. He can go to hell! Come on! We've lost him. What was that? Taylor? What is that? Jesus! Taylor! Oh, my God. Your mouth... Who did this to you? They're here. Shh. Oh, my God. His mouth's sewn up. Don't move. I'm gonna cut you free. Nice and gently. Nice and gently. Trust me. Shh. It's OK. It's OK. Shh. Just keep still. Whose idea was this? Do you know what this place is? Of course. I read all about it. Are you the guy that runs it? OK, last one. You have no idea what you're dealing with. Look at what you've done! I... Warren? Who did this to you? What did you do in the chapel? Nothing. This isn't a game. You're all in danger, alright? It's haunted, isn't it? That priest. Come on, let's go. Well, come on! No, I'm not going anywhere. Liam, please. You started this. You have to stop it! I'm not scared. There is not God. There is no God! Max! Please! What are you doing? It's what they did in The Exorcist. Don't be stupid. You have to stop it. You started the black magic. The ghost just needs to know you're wrong. I believe! I believe in the Lord! I believe in the Lord! Why did you do it? Why did you come here? Just think! Think! He just needs to know you're sorry. It was your dad. It was your dad. You've got to move on. Forgive him. Dad, Dad... I-I... I know you're sorry. I just wish you were here so I could tell you. I forgive you. I forgive you... Are you OK? You're safe. You're OK. Leave. Get out of here and don't come back. Let's get out of here. ..in the name of the Father, the Son... Joseph took a child, a baby. That's why the chaplain was murdered. So Joseph sewed up his mouth to keep him quiet. He must have kept the baby until she was a girl. That's why I keep seeing Eve. That's why she's so scared of him. But why are you having visions? The ghost is gone. No, he hasn't. Oh, no. No, no. Joseph... Joseph! Why did you start that blog up again? Honestly. Um... I was pissed off at you and Dan. Max, I don't belong to you. I know. I just thought maybe we'd... Things are better as they are, OK? Yeah. You're probably right. Ellie? Ellie? What did you see? I saw it through her eyes. I know who Eve is. Who? Me. I spent the first years of my life kept in a cage by a twisted sadist! Wouldn't you want to run? He's lost his mind. I need to be sure what I saw. You're braver than that. Am I? He was an evil man. He's come back for revenge. Max! There's these tunnels under the building. Ellie's in danger. You've got to call the police. Did you know who she was when she got here? Do you want to save her? No!
