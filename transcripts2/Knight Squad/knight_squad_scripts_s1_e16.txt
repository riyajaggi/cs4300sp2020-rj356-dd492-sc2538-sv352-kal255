 ♪ Corrected & Synced by Bakugan Happy Halloween, guys. [LAUGHS] I brought you some giant candy. Sorry, they only had the mini size. [GRUNTS] Thanks, Prudy. I'm working on a mask for tonight's Halloween party. They ran out of tiger masks, so, I have to be a ferocious bunny rabbit. [GROWLING] Yeah, I should keep looking.

 What are you going as, Warwick? Same thing as last year... The Princess' future boyfriend. Ooh, I'll grab a mask for Ciara. She could be... a princess. Oh! She'd hate that. But, Dad, you make me miss the Halloween party every year. All the other kids go. The other kids don't have to worry about the Shadow Ghost. Guard! Scary background music. [SUSPENSEFUL VIOLIN MUSIC] According to legend, every Halloween night the ghost searches for royals to possess.

 According to me, you made that story up. And once it's dark, we're only safe inside these walls. If the ghost possesses a royal, it can enter the castle and sit on the throne. And lock into the royal's body forever. - Crescendo! - [DRAMATIC VIOLIN MUSIC] Dad, I'm not a baby. You need to stop being so overprotective. I'm not being overprotective. You make me drink out of a sippy goblet. Can't I just go to the party for a little bit? No. But just think of all the fun you'll have locked in your room. What's fun about that? Ah, for starters, I got you this. It looks like a jack-o-lantern, but it magically harnesses the power of the sun to keep the Shadow Ghost away. It's a Sun Pumpkin. This goofy thing has the power of the sun? [PUMPKIN CLICKS ON] ALL: [GASPING] Oh, my eyes! [PUMPKIN CLICKS OFF] My bad! [MAGIC WHOOSHING] [GRUNTS OF COMBAT] BUTTERCUP: [GIGGLES] Aw, hi, Unicorn Squad. Look who woke up from their nap and found their Halloween gift. [LAUGHING] Trick or treat! I mean, just trick. Ha! Now you're one step closer to becoming a real unicorn. SAGE: [LAUGHING] - Sage! - BOTH: [GASP] You glued horns on Unicorn Squad. [LAUGHS] Well, if they didn't want horns, they should have just called themselves "The Pony Squad." But what about Fizz? Look at this! People are using me as a ring toss. Leave my horn! [LAUGHING] Well, you'll be cleaning every piece of battle equipment as your punishment. But what about the Halloween party? I have a metal hand and an eye patch. Every day for me is a Halloween party. You can start by cleaning Davey, the practice dummy. Before I lost my good hand, I used to be able to punch clear through his chest. But now this happens. [HAND BOINGING] [VOICE WOBBLING] And... it's... it's painful. Well, this is a pile of moat garbage. We need to get to that party. I have an idea. We could clean really fast and make the end of the party. It's the ultimate rebellion... Doing what we're told. Oh, Buttercup, I'm the idea person. And you're the faithful sidekick. I always thought I was the muscle. [GIGGLING] Wait, Sir Gareth misses his old hand. If we replaced his metal one with a real one, he'll let us go to the party. Where do we get one of those? You see, I know someone who knows someone who sells [SILENTLY] used hands. Oh. I know someone who knows someone who sells used belly button lint. Is that someone you? Sure is! You wanna pet it? - No. - [GIGGLING] [MAGIC WHOOSHING] Warwick, why are you carving a heart into a jack-o-lantern? The Princess can't go to the party, so, I'm making this for her. I call it I Love You Lantern. Aw, that's so sweet. Except your heart looks like a butt. Come on, Prudy, I need you to toss me up to the Princess' balcony. Okay. [LAUGHS] You know how much I love throwing people. My Dad's being ridiculous. I've gotta figure out a way to get to that party. All right, I'm just gonna say this. I don't think you should go. But I'm sneaking out to go to a party. How are you not on Team Ciara right now? Yeah, well, it's not worth it. Your Dad says there's a Shadow Ghost looking to possess a royal. My Dad always makes up stories to scare me into following his rules. All right. Well, what if the Shadow Ghost is real? Do you know how many ghosts I ran into between here and Seagate? - Zero? - Four. Yeah, one was mean, one was terrifying, one was dangerous, and one was all three. Look, why take a chance? Because I wanna prove to my Dad I know his story's fake. Well, the only way to prove him wrong is for the Princess to show up at the party and risk getting possessed by the ghost, and she'd never do that. Right? She'd never do that. She did it, y'all! Happy Halloween! CROWD: [CHEERING] ♪ Hey ♪ ARC: Do you wanna know a secret? CIARA: I'm a princess whose father won't let her become a knight. Please let me go to Knight School, Daddy! Please, please, please! So I use a magic ring and secretly train as Ciara. Yes! ARC: And I'm Arc, a charming thief, who has the same dream. I'm destined to become a knight. CIARA: But people from outside the kingdom aren't allowed in Knight School. ARC: So I'm pretending I belong here. CIARA: Now, we protect each other's secrets. ARC: So we can achieve our dream of becoming knights. ♪ We are the Knight Squad ♪ ♪ Hey! ♪♪ [LIVELY DANCE PARTY MUSIC] ♪ What should I try first? [GASPS] Ooh! Bobbing for turkey legs. Don't mind if I do. Do I seem sweaty right now? I was not prepared to see my future girlfriend and future-future wife. I guess if she's here, she doesn't believe in the Shadow Ghost Legend. Yeah, clearly, she has terrible judgment. Which is why I have a shot. I'll be right back. Okay. Prudy, tell me how to impress a girl. Oh! I like it when guys can lift large goats over their heads. Although, if you lift from the wrong end, it is not cute. CROWD: [CHEERING] And that's how it's done, people! CROWD: [CHEERING] Time for a magic mirror selfie. [CAMERA CLICKS] ♪KingSoWrong. The Shadow Ghost could show up tonight. This is so irresponsible. Wow. You sound just like my Dad. I do not. Go to your room, young lady! Okay, I hear it now. I'm not going anywhere until my Dad sees proof no one possessed me. It was nice talking to you, Arc. I'll get the King working on that cure for your smelly breath. My breath smells regular! Just go talk to her. You can do it. Just say whatever comes to your mind. I wear pants. What he meant to say was... "Hey, girl." All right, let's find the guy selling those hands so we can get to that party. What about the freaky guy who's staring at us? [GIGGLING] [CLEARS THROAT] So, are you a second-hand hand dealer? Maybe. Are you buyin' or sellin'? Buying. That's a shame. Nice knuckles. Mmm. They're good for punching. Wanna see them up close? You're a live one. I like that. Can you give us a hand or not, you talking freckle? Oh, I can give you lots of hands. What'll it be? I've got classic, hefty, righty and lefty. What do we look like... tourists? Let's see the good stuff. This one's a good snapper. This one's a good waver. And look at this beauty. It was made for pickin' noses. Sage, I have an idea. Let's leave because this guy creeps me out. No offense. [GIGGLES] None taken. Creepy is my thing. Remember, idea person... ...muscle. ...sidekick. Here's how this works, okay? You sprinkle this attachment dust on the hand, and, boom, you're in business. All right. We'll take the nose picker. Four gold pieces? I'm not sellin' feet here. I've only got one hand you could afford. Ew! Where'd you find this... In the gutter? Yes, actually. Please remember, if you have any problems, we have a 100 percent "I Do Not Care" policy. Okay, it's dark out and I did a survey. It turns out nobody wants you here. Who's happy the Princess is here? CROWD: [CHEERING, HOOTING] They don't count. I'm not going anywhere until I prove my Dad wrong. Hey, Goblingram, this one goes out to the King. Dad, you thought there'd be a ghost here. [MAGIC WHOOSHING] And you were right! Cool party! Mind if I crash and... [DEEP, GRAVELY VOICE] possess your Princess? Just in case you get possessed, and I don't get to tell you this later. I told you so. CROWD: [MIXED COMMENTS, SHOUTING] Calm down, everybody. I'm not possessing the rest of y'all. [DEEP, GRAVELY VOICE] Just the Princess. Why does she only use that voice when she's talking about me? We need to protect the Princess. I got it. That ghost is about to have a giant problem. - [GRUNTING] - Oh, it hurts! JK! I'm a ghost, dummy. Warwick, sunlight will stop the Shadow Ghost. Do you have any spells that will do that? You know I do. Illuminata, lighty-brighty! These are itty-bitty baby nightlights. Okay, some of us just call them "nightlights." Get back! Are you seriously trying to stop me with itty-bitty baby nightlights? Maybe. Is it working? An itty-bitty baby bit. Just so you know, once those burn out, your Princess is toast! Why are you doing this? Centuries ago, I was set to marry a super-cute prince. Then one Halloween, he ran off with his true love... [DEEP, GRAVELY VOICE] and I never got to be princess! Wow. I wonder why he dumped you. You seem so nice. Ha. Ha. You're so funny. [DEEP, GRAVELY VOICE] So's this! [BLOWING AIR] I'm just full of surprises, right? - Run! - ALL: [SCREAMING] ♪ ♪ Yeah hey hey ♪ Wha...? I was going to let you go to the party. But you seem to have missed a spot... everywhere! Sir Gareth, we actually have a little gift for you. Trying to bribe your way out of punishment? He won't fall for that. Ah! A new hand! All is forgiven! Oh! [CLAPS HANDS] [GRUNTS, METAL CLANKS] Don't forget the attachment dust. Here we go. [MAGIC WHOOSHING] Oh! Ah! Oh! [LAUGHING] It fits like a glove! Which is now something you can wear on both hands. Oh! Oh! Oh! Look at me! I can clap again! [LAUGHING] Watch this! Watch this! Here's the church. Here's the steeple. Open the door and here's the people! Look at them! Mm-hm, that's great. We're going to the party. Okay. Okay. Um... um... have fun! Uh, Fizz can polish up the rest of this stuff. What? You can't let them off the hook. Of course, he can. [WHISPERING] And he just did. It took buckets of Go-Away Goo to get that horn off. My forehead's all burned. What? Oh, yes, you're right. My new hand does look good. [LAUGHING] There are so many things I wanna... I wanna do with it. Where should I start? [SHARP SMACK] With your face. Good choice. That wasn't me. [GRUNTING] I think my new hand is evil! No, no, maybe it just misunderstood. [GRUNTING] [SCREAMS] Oh! No, it's just evil. [GRUNTING] [MAGIC WHOOSHING] ALL: [SHOUTING MIXED COMMENTS] [SHOUTING STOPS] Ha! Ha! You're out of breath. [LAUGHING] I miss breathing. Okay, look, the Shadow Ghost wants to possess a royal, so, if you're not the princess, she'll go away. Good idea. I just need a distraction. One charming distraction coming up. S'up, Shadow Bae? You know, you'd be cute, if you did something with your hair and were less dead. [GAGGING] Ew! I just ghost barfed in my mouth. You coulda just said no, but... Hey, guys, how's the party? It's taken a bit of a turn. Where's the Princess?! Well, you're outta luck. The guards snuck her back to the castle while you pretended to not be into all of this. Give it up, Ghost. There's no more royalty here for you to possess. Princess, I know you're here! I saw your Goblingram ♪KingSoWorried. Oh, no! Not a princess, but... [DEEP, GRAVELY VOICE] I guess any royal will do. [SHOUT OF COMBAT] [GRUNTING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [INHALING] [DEEP, GRAVELY VOICE] Bow down to your new leader! Or curtsey, if that's your deal. Whatever! I have a throne to sit on. [HIGH-PITCHED LAUGHTER] Good. We got here before the Ghost. Yep. Luckily, she jumped into a super-slow Dad bod. Prudy, protect the throne. We can't let the Ghost sit on it, or she'll permanently possess my Dad. Dad-King. He's like a father to all of us. Wait, the King gave the Princess a Sun Pumpkin to protect her. The light from it could send the Shadow Ghost away for good. I bet it's in the Princess' room. - One of us should go get... - I'll get it! Me! Me! Hey! I would have been here sooner, but I kept tripping over this ridiculous robe. But it'll all be worth it to sit my ghost butt on that throne. Not if we kick it, first! Your butt, not the throne. It looks expensive. Don't worry, my Dad's terrible with swords. Woo! Woo! Hah! But the Ghost is amazeballs. [GRUNTING] [MAGIC WHOOSHING] [SCREAMING] No! No! Not the nose hairs! They're the only original things left on my body! [SCREAMS] You're a monster! We have to get rid of that hand. What are we supposed to do? The attachment dust we used is too strong. Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! I have an idea. Shush, Butt, I'm trying to work on a plan. But I already figured it out. - Not now! - Yes, now! Gosh darn it, Sage! You never listen to me! Sometimes sidekicks have good ideas, too! [CLEARS THROAT] Whoa. It's always the quiet ones. I was just trying to say all we have to do is get the evil hand to punch the dummy. How's hitting Fizz gonna help? No, Davey, the Dummy. Unh, why not? [GRUNTING] Ah! Wet Willy! Hey, Evil Hand! How's it feel like to know you're not as strong as Sir Gareth's old hand? Oh! Why are you making it angry? Just saying. The old hand could punch right through the training dummy. But this one never will. Ho, hum... [GRUNTING] Ah! [SCREAMS] Don't listen to them! You're very strong, especially when you're hurting me! [ROARING] [HEAVY THUD] - I'm stuck! - Exactly. I filled it with Go-Away Goo. Now the hand will go away. It's right in the name. [STRAINING] I'm free! Oh, I never thought I'd be so happy to lose a body part. Yay! [GIGGLING] Yay! Score one for the muscle! [GIGGLING] [GRUNTING] Oh! Oh! I missed you, Metal Hand. Oh... You might not have an opposable thumb, but you never forced me to eat a cricket. Mmmmm... Buttercup, I'm sorry I didn't listen to your idea. Thanks, Sage. And you're sorry you glued a unicorn horn to my head? No. I'm good. [MAGIC WHOOSHING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [SWORDS CLANGING] ♪ Is it just me, or am I makin' this Dad bod work? [DRAMATIC MUSIC CONTINUES] ♪ [GRUNTS OF EFFORT] ♪ Sorry, not sorry. King, if you're in there, I apologize for what I'm about to do. [GRUNTING] Wait! What's happening? Your Majesty? Nope, still me! [DRAMATIC MUSIC CONTINUES] I've got the Sun Pumpkin. It won't work, unless we draw the Ghost out of the King's body... According to the legend. Which now I totally believe. Well, how are we gonna do that? She's in the King's body, but she really wants to be the Princess. You can't. It's too dangerous. GHOST/KING: [LAUGHING] I have to save my Dad. Yay! I finally get to sit on the throne. PRUDENCE: [GRUNT OF EFFORT] - GHOST/KING: Oh! - [HEAVY THUD] PRUDENCE: [ROARING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] Please, don't. I'm not falling for that again. Yeah! Just falling! PRUDENCE: [GASPS] [DRAMATIC MUSIC CONTINUES] ♪ GHOST/KING: [HIGH-PITCHED LAUGHTER] Hey, Ghost Girl! I thought you wanted to be a princess. Well, you do have a better outfit. [SNIFFING] And don't smell like a middle-aged man. [GRUNTS] The Shadow Ghost! No! [DEEP, GRAVELY VOICE] You're mine, Princess! Give me the Sun Pumpkin, Warwick. She said my name. Yeah, she also said to give her the pumpkin. Sorry. Time to light this candle. [PUMPKIN CLICKS ON] SHADOW GHOST: [GROANING] You guys are no fun! [ECHOING] [PUMPKIN CLICKS OFF] Did I embarrass myself with the Princess? No way, dude. When you gave her that pumpkin, you also gave her a bad case of the Warwicks. Are you okay, Dad? Now I am. Oh, sweetheart, I was so scared. But you held your own. Well, I wouldn't have had to, if I'd just believed you. I guess you weren't being overprotective. True, but I could ease up a bit. Maybe it's time to take the lid off of your sippy goblet. [REMOVES LID] - Happy Halloween, Dad. - [LIQUID SPLATTERING] Yeah. I'm gonna need that lid back. ♪ Na, na, na, hey ♪ ♪ ♪ Hey ♪ Corrected & Synced by Bakugan ♪ Hey ♪ ♪ ♪ Hey ♪ ♪ ♪♪ ♪
