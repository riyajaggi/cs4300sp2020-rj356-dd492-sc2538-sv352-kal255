 A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES There's someone else like me who answered the Jinn's call. Does anyone smell piss? - Where's Yassin? - It wasn't me. Nasser, no! Someone at your school. Someone who's angry at everyone. Nothing is wrong. Find the summoner! Looks like my magic sand trick didn't really work. Shouldn't have listened to Hassan. You won't get rid of me that easily.

 My brother used to sit here when he was upset... or mad at me. Keras, this is not going to work. I can't help you. Yes, you can. Why would you believe that? Why would you believe in me? You stood up against Tareq and Fahed. You're strong. And I need your strength. Tareq was being a jerk. I just called him out on it like anyone would. Do you think this is easy for me? Mira, people are dying, all because of that Jinn. And you're thinking about yourself? How can you be so selfish? I'm not being selfish.

 I'm being realistic. There's a difference. I wouldn't have chosen you if you were weak. I told you, Keras, I can't help you. Whether you help or not, just know that I won't leave you alone until we stop that Jinn. Are you threatening me? It seems like you're the evil Jinn. Mira, I need you. And I'm sure you can figure out who the summoner is. So you're not going away, are you? You're like a mosquito. Don't give me that smile! So, what now? See if you notice anything weird. And don't get yourself in trouble, especially with Fahed. That's totally unfair. When a student dies, the sluttiest teacher gets thrown under the bus. But they're firing Ms. Ola, and she had nothing to do with it. - Poor baby! You want to fuck Ms. Ola? - Shut up and hear me out. They should be looking for that Jinn. Will you shut the fuck up about that already? If you don't want to listen, then don't. Poor thing. He's never going to get laid. Tell me about it! Bro, what happened with you and Mira? Is it over? I don't know. She's acting so weird lately. Well, instead of being a total dick, you might want to try talking to her, or at least breathing in her direction. Really? Look who's trying to teach me! You want her to end up like your girlfriend? Will you shut your trap? - Give me a lighter. - Now you want a lighter too? So... what about Mira's party? I don't know. She made a fool out of me. But you love her, right? Yeah, I do. Then throw a party to show how much you love her. Plus, if you do that, I guarantee you that you'll score with her. - Hassan, where have you been? - Hey, Omar. Did you find anything? Yeah. Way more than I expected. - It's not here... - Then what are you waiting for? Listen, Omar, I checked, and you're definitely next. - How do you know? - It's either you or Jameel. Jameel or me? How come? Remember the bonfire at Petra? You were the only two left. Mira and Fahed left, then the goat bleated. What about Layla? Look, I can't raise my voice in the library... - Why are you so scared? - Are you kidding? Just tell me. Why not Layla? - The Jinn won't hurt Layla. - Why not? Are you kidding? She's my cousin. Jinn only attack those who deserve it. - Hi, Yassin. - Hi. - Can I talk to you? - No, you can't. I want to apologize for what happened. I tried to stop the guys, but you know what they're like. I really tried. I did. I tried. I'm really sorry. Let's just say... that you did me a favor when you left me in that hole. A favor? And you just did yourself a favor as well. OK. Is that good enough for you? I wish I could do something to show him how humiliated I felt. What the hell? Omar, what happened? I must have slipped. - What's with Yassin and that girl? - I don't know. She's weird. I saw you. What were you guys talking about? Nothing. What do you care? There you are. Happy birthday. Thank you. Did you forget? Happy birthday. - Listen... - Weren't you throwing a party this week? Yes, but there's been a lot going on so I couldn't find the time. Yeah, things have been pretty weird lately. Listen. Are you and Vera together or something? Why are you asking? Jealous? Jealous? Of course not! I just didn't realize you were into that type of girl. I mean, would she mind if I stole you from her tonight? What do you mean? I mean, to hang out, you and I. We can have dinner together like we used to, when we were kids. Where would we go? The club? Of course not! I don't know, let's just go wherever. You really want to? Yeah. We haven't hung out in a long time. Hello, baby, Mira! - Hi. - How are you doing? - Good. - I'm so happy to see you. - Happy birthday. - Thank you. So, tonight at eight? - OK. Why not? - Bye. - Send me the location. - OK. I knew you'd figure it out. We must act before he causes more harm. Yassin isn't like that, Keras. He's kind, but he has many reasons to hate the world. Can you convince him to stop seeing her? I'll try. I'll talk to him. Shit. I promised Layla I'd go out with her tonight. Layla? How well do you know Layla? What do you mean? Why? You shouldn't let her distract you. I'll figure something out. Let's talk later. Yassin, what's wrong? Fine, we'll talk later. Excuse me. Thank you so much. I appreciate everything you've done for us. No worries. Let me know how it goes. Sure. Ms. Ola, I have something important to tell you. - Where are your parents? - Forget about them. - Hassan... - Just a minute. Sweetie, the whole point of the PTA meeting is to talk to parents... I know, but this is way more important. I mean it will really help you. Just plug this in. My laptop is really shitty. How will it help? I know you're in trouble because of what happened in Petra. The whole school is talking about it. Even Amman Gossip is talking about it. Check it out. Listen to me. This will clear your name. Ms. Ola... I know what killed Tareq. You saw the cliff where Tareq fell. There's no way he could have gotten up there so fast. Only a creature that travels through time and space could do that. Like Jinn, except that Jinn need to be summoned... Hassan. What happened to Tareq was an accident. We can't change what already happened. Ms. Ola, not everything in life is an accident. Let me show you. As I was saying, Jinn have to be summoned. - And even if they're summoned... - Hassan, get to the point. Ms. Ola... a Jinn killed Tareq to please its summoner. And it's going to get worse if we don't act. So I'm going to Petra tonight. - Did you make sure she's coming? - Yes, it's all going to plan. What's wrong? I don't know. What if it doesn't work? Mira and I have been through a rough patch. If you want things to work out, they will. By the way, what's the deal with Naji? - Does he hate me now? - I don't know, ask him. I know I pissed him off but don't you think we're a cute couple? I don't think you should ask me that question! - What's the matter? - Nothing. Yassin, you can tell me if something is bothering you. They want to take me out to dinner. For my birthday. - One happy family! - With your stepfather? You mean with the asshole? Yeah, my stepfather, who else? Ms. Ola thinks it will bring us closer together. Why can't they leave me alone? At least I could... Whatever. They think they know what's best for you so they will never leave you alone. That's the problem, Vera! But they just don't get it. How about I tag along? I told them I had plans with Mira. I said we're going alone so they wouldn't invite themselves. At least Mira treats me like a human being. So you'd rather go out with another girl than with me? What? No, of course not, Vera, but... Listen... Mira and I used to be friends. And today is our birthday. Happy birthday to both of you. Vera... Of course I'd like to go out with you as well, but... I'll cancel with her if you want. It's settled, then. - Hi. - Hi. Happy birthday, honey. I made your favorite pasta. - I'm not hungry. - Please, baby. Come on, it's your birthday. How is school? Good. Honey, I know that recently you've been... - Can we drop this? - I'm just worried about you. Dad, I'm not a little girl anymore. I know you're not. But after the accident, everything changed. Dad, not everything has to do with Mom. I have to go. I'm late for my birthday plans. I don't understand why he canceled. Yassin hates his family. She must have convinced him. I bet she's in there with him right now. Is there a problem? No. You get Yassin to come and meet you out here, and I'll deal with Vera. OK. Shit, it's Layla. Again? Hello? - Hi, Mira. - Hi, Layla. Did you forget we're having dinner? - I don't think I can make it. - What? You promised! - Something came up. - Don't tell me this is about Keras. No, it has nothing to do with Keras. Don't be mad, I didn't mean to... You can't let him keep doing this to you. Sorry. - Listen, it's fine... - One second, Layla. You go. Today's your birthday. You should be with your friends. Are you sure? I'll stay here and make sure nothing happens. - Layla, give me ten minutes. - Hurry up. OK. I won't be late, OK? I trust you. Stop saying you trust me! Why would you? You disrupted your life for me enough. But you should be happy. After tonight we'll forget about this whole thing, and I'll leave you alone. You won't have to see me again. That's not what I want anymore. I actually like having you around. - Hi. - Hi. Come on, we're running late. Let's go. What are we late for? Where are we going? Why are you dressed up? You're acting weird. Enough questions. It's your birthday. Let's go. Layla... - I just have a bad feeling. - What is it? Well, honestly... Don't tell me this is about Keras again. - Never mind, it's not important. - OK. I'm so happy you came with us today. Aren't you, Yassin? Yassin? It's so nice she was able to join us. Nice. Yeah. - Thank you for the invitation. - Don't mention it. And you'll meet Zuhair soon. He's on his way. Because he's always punctual, isn't he? And he brings the party with him! Zuhair... But we're having a good time, aren't we? Why didn't you tell me we were going to Fahed's? - As if you would have agreed! - How would you know? - I bet Naji is here, right? - I don't know. - What's all this? - Surprise! Happy birthday! I'll leave you to it. - This is too much. - No, this is nothing. I didn't expect you to do this for me. I also wanted to apologize for what happened the other day. - But when I see you with that kid... - I'm not with him, Fahed. I know, but when I see you with him I feel like something's not right. I can take care of myself. I know that! So... What? - All your tracks are right there. - No! Let's go. Who's ready for some of Mira's music? And here we go. Hello, hello! Hello. Did you order for me? Yes, you were late so I ordered you a steak. So you're Vera? I'm Vera. So how come a pretty girl like you... You paid her to come here, didn't you? Zuhair, please. - My husband likes to joke. - "Yeah, he likes to joke"! Don't talk to her like that. Honey, Zuhair is kidding. I'm kidding, Vera. Zuhair... Poor thing! Didn't anybody love you as a child? So you try to fill that void with... alcohol. No, I mean humor! She's funny! She made me laugh. Where's the food? Happy birthday! Excuse me for a minute, OK? I barely recognized you. You know I have to take you back to our realm. Yassin needs me. Where did you meet Vera? Did you hear the way she was talking? - You can always go back, though. - Who... Who are you to judge these people? Where are you going? I have to go, Fahed. Sorry, but I didn't notice the time. - You have somewhere else to be? - No. It's just, I'm late. Everyone deserves justice. I'm just trying to fix what's broken. I want to help those who can't help themselves. We don't do that anymore. And you know Yassin won't survive. Mira, we need to go, now. - Keras, what... - We need to go. - What happened? - I needed you, but Vera... What are you doing here? - Hey, you animal! - Zuhair. Your son just made a scene. - Zuhair, please sit. - See how you spoil him? - I'm not here to hurt you. - You must be kidding. Fahed, enough. - You brought him? - I didn't know he was coming. OK, get out of here. Stop it, calm down. I'll call an Uber. Would you like to get rid of him? Zuhair? Someone help us, please! He's choking! Someone call an ambulance! He's dying! - An Uber is on its way. - Get moving. - Let's go. - Don't touch her. - Hey, guys! What's going on? - Jameel, hold him! Keras! Layla? Subtitle translation by Nancy Nasser
