 Mira, you're the only one I need. Dr. Mustafa, please go to Surgery Center Three. I'm sorry, Mrs. Swaidan. I'm so sorry. Thank you, dear. Thank you both for being here. Layla, you know my son better than anyone. I mean, before all this happened to Nasser did he mention anything to you? Is there anything you're hiding from me? Maybe I said something... Nasser has always been strong. He didn't say anything to us. But when he wakes up I'm sure he'll tell us what happened. I'm sure, sweetie. I'm going for some water. Does anyone want anything? - No. - No, thanks. Keras? Mira, you must believe in yourself. Look, I know you're scared, but... I'm going to protect you. I need you to trust me and I need your help. How did you know Nasser was going to do that? - Nasser was possessed by a Jinn. - Possessed by a Jinn? What do you mean, possessed? Are you OK? - I'm fine. - Alright. Why would you say that? Why would you say that Nasser is OK? He told me he loved me and I never gave him an answer. No, Layla. Don't say that. - This is all my fault. - Layla, listen to me. Maybe it's something else that has nothing to do with you. What do you mean? I mean... I don't know how to say this, but... Do you believe in Jinn? So you're saying... that a Jinn was controlling Nasser and made him pick up a knife and do that to himself? Yes. Mira, love, you need to go home and get some sleep because you're not making any sense. OK, Layla, I know it sounds crazy but why would I lie to you? I'm obviously not making all this up. Nasser's mother needs to hear this. Layla... I have to tell Nasser's mother. Layla, don't be scared. - Mira, what's happening? - Don't scream. Mira, who's that? - Let her go, Keras! - You can't tell anyone about me. You can't just do this to people. Let her go, now. - Are you OK? - Who is this guy? What's going on? Keras, open the door! You can't lock us in here. I can't let what happened to Nasser happen again. Now listen up, I don't care if you're a Jinn, or a ghost, or some two-bit jerk who's pulling a prank. Either you open this door right now, or I'll show you a face that you won't like. Layla, calm down. He's not here to hurt us. Is he the Jinn who did this to Nasser? No, it wasn't him. Another Jinn did this. So Nasser really didn't do it to himself? It wasn't Nasser. But he's still in danger. And if we don't act fast, you and all your loved ones will be, too. - Why me? - You're who summoned me. But I didn't do anything to summon you. And I have no control over this. I just called, and you answered. What do you want, anyway? I need you to help me send the Jinn back where she came from. - Before more follow her. - There are more Jinn? A lot more. And trust me, you don't want them here. If they break out they will cause more harm. OK, now open the door. You can't tell anyone, and we must act quickly. OK, Just open the door! Mira, where did he go? I don't know. Mira, we have to do something about this. There were two girls, and one of them was so hot, and the other one was so stoned! She started talking to me in Chinese or something! - But it must have been boring without me. - No, we had a blast, honestly. Hello! What's up? - What's up? - Ready for breakfast? Yeah! That's what I'm talking about. Fuck... This damn thing, man. That Nasser is a complete psycho. It's fine. He's my friend. How do you call him a friend after he cut you with a knife, bro? Why the long faces on such a beautiful day? Give it here. Keras? Keras? Mira. - Shit... - What's the matter? - Nothing. Never mind. - What is it? - Why do you keep doing that? - Doing what? You keep popping out of nowhere. Well, I'm sorry. Are me and my friends really in danger? Yes, but I'm going to protect you. I will never leave your side. You won't keep disappearing? No, I'll stay with you until we find the summoner, so that I can take the Jinn back. Wait, so you're saying there's someone else like me? Someone who answered a Jinn's call? Yes. It's someone at your school. Someone who's angry at everyone. And we must find them soon. Take off your sweater and wear this one. Come on. And remember, don't talk to anyone. If someone talks to you, ignore them. Don't answer. I see you're still together! You look cute together, I must say. Do you really think you can take him to school? I can try, at least. Naji. I'll be right back. - Does it fit? Is it too small? - I think it's fine. How are we supposed to find this summoner? - Hi, guys. - Hi. - Hi, Naji. - I know what you want. - Make it quick, Layla. - You don't know what I'm going to say. - Listen to me, first. - I don't care. Well, well... Who's the hunk? Fahed, chill. I'll explain everything later. Go have fun with your... What's his face? Your crazy boyfriend. - You deserve each other. - Naji... - Yeah, Mira, who's this pretty boy? - Wait, I'm serious here. What is there to explain? You have a new boyfriend? So every guy I talk to is my boyfriend? You're joking, right? - I can talk to whoever I want. - No, you can't. - How dare you speak to her like that? - Keras, don't. - Wow! A real man! - Want to try me? - I'll show you who's the man. - Stop it. What did I tell you about talking that way to people in the city? How dare you talk to him like that? He's a relative of mine. Right, Mira? - He's her cousin. - Yes. My cousin. He's visiting from... He's a Bedouin. Yeah. - This clown is your cousin? - Yes, he is. What's your problem? - Well, he's a real tough guy! - How could you do that, Fahed? - Stop yelling. - Let me show you around. Try not to get into a fight for once! Don't yell. I've been calling since yesterday and you didn't pick up. Just leave me alone. What's wrong? What is it? - I'm sorry... - It wasn't you. - What's wrong, Fahed? - His arm started hurting all of a sudden. Who's the new kid? He's Layla's cousin. He needs to report to the Principal's office. Come with me. Quickly. You did that? - I promised to protect you. - Not like that! - Well, it's what you wanted. - Me? I never asked you for anything. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Happy birthday! It's not my birthday for several days. - But you like an early celebration. - Yeah, when I was seven! Yassin! - You don't want to talk about your face? - It's nothing. I'm fine. I wish I could do something to protect you. Where's your husband? He's out. He didn't stay with one of his girlfriends? Eat your breakfast. - Zuhair... - Zuhair is a piece of shit! But I need him, and you need him too. Do we have to keep fighting with him? Like yesterday and every damn day? I had a fight with him yesterday about your tuition fees. What? We're behind on the payments, but we'll figure it out. But next year, we might have to... How much longer do I have to put up with his shit? - Baby, this isn't just about you. - Obviously! Don't worry about my fees. I'll figure it out. - I'm not done! - I'm going to be late. Like you even care about my education! Morning. Good morning. Did you spend the night out here? No. You don't look too good. Well... What are you doing today? I don't know. I'll come back from school, study, then go to bed. - Let's do something. - Like what? - How did it go? - I took care of it. OK. What happened? The Principal will talk to your dad. My dad? Why? I had no other choice! It's fine now. I sorted it out. Listen, there are many angry people here. Any one of them could be our summoner. Oh, yeah? This is high school, OK? That means everyone here is angry for their own reasons. We're running out of time! - Any word on Nasser? - Hang on! There's no time for Nasser. We need to find the summoner immediately. We have to go to class. What class? I'm telling you, we're running out of time. Well, if I don't show up in class, the school will call my dad. And if they do, my dad will start asking questions that you don't want asked. So after class, we can look for whoever you want. OK? Plus, it will be fun! Fine, let's go to class. - Trust me, it was the goat from Petra. - Not again, please! - Did you hear that goat in Petra or not? - I did! But it had nothing to do with Tareq's fall. Not everything is connected. First Tareq, and then Nasser. What about all these coincidences? However I look at it, the only explanation I can come up with is Jinn. I can prove it. Sure, like you proved that Ms. Ola has connections with aliens! Forget about that. Let's go to Petra and find the goat. Sure! It's only 20 minutes away! We'll go there and be back before third period! How about that? Anyways... did you check Amman's Gossip page recently? Yeah, why? I heard about a funding program in the UAE where they fund any page with 100,000 followers. - Do you hear what I'm saying? - Yeah. We have nearly 100,000 followers on the page. But how is that relevant to what you said? What do you mean? Everyone's talking about what happened to Nasser and Tareq. If we can prove that the Jinn did all this... Everyone will follow our page. But you're saying that the Jinn already hurt two people. That's serious. Don't pretend you're not scared. We all know who's next. What do you mean? You mean me? I mean, it could be you. But I really don't know. It could be me or anyone else from that bonfire. Anyone who heard that goat could be in danger. I don't know. OK, let's say we go to Petra and we find the Jinn goat. Then what? Repeat after me. You must say, "I command thee to leave this body!" Then you throw sand and it disappears. I have to memorize that phrase? Also, no one carries sand around. Here. - Take it. I have lots. - Everyone's going nuts! Tell me about it! How's your arm? Better. - Hey, what's with your fucking cousin? - Who? - The Bedouin-looking kid. - Never seen him in my life. Definitely not my cousin. Maybe Layla's dating him or something. So soon after Nasser? What a slut! - Hey, that's my cousin. - Yeah, that's the slut I mean! Let's get to class. Sorry, Yassin. - We were called to an urgent meeting. - That's OK, Ms. Ola. Are you going to try out this year? Of course not. Didn't you say you were practising to be a goalkeeper? If anything, I'll be a defender. Center-back. I mean, it's not the coolest position, but... at least I would defend the team instead of just attacking all the time. The Principal told me you're having difficulties paying your tuition. Is that what you wanted to talk about? - Actually... - What is it? Can you not mention the tuition issue to my mom at the parents' meeting? - I want to spare her. - Why, Yassin? - Someone has to pay. - I know they do. I'll sort it out. I'm already looking for a job. Yassin, I'm sure your mom will have a better solution. No, she definitely won't! All I'm asking is that you don't mention it to her, that's all. - I mean... Don't bother. - Yassin... Just please, don't say anything. Please. Just don't. I need to get back to the board about this. The same board that refused to grant me a scholarship? They didn't refuse. Your father didn't present the paperwork. That man is not my father! - Just a second. - How could you say that? Yassin, let's settle this with your mother tomorrow, OK? Hi, dear. Sorry to interrupt, but I was looking for Yassin. He'll be with you in a minute, OK? We're almost done. Excuse me. Ms. Ola, are you OK? Vera, please, go get some water or something. It's OK, dear. You can go now, I'm fine. Let's talk about this tomorrow, OK? I'll join you in a minute, OK? - Are you sure? - Yes. Now, go. - Ms. Ola, I'm sorry, but... - It's not your fault. - Let's finish this tomorrow. - OK. So Darwin developed his theory of evolution after noticing close similarities between... Psst! Layla, who's the new kid? - Mira? - Shh! This is taking too long. When does this class end? We'll look for the summoner after class. Don't worry. That's so cool! I never knew we had Bedouin relatives. - Hassan, stop it! - Quiet, Layla! Is that more important than Darwin's theory? As it will definitely be on next week's pop quiz. Which may naturally select who passes the course. - Sir? - Yes, Omar? How is it a pop quiz when you just told us it's next week? You're very smart, Omar. That's why tomorrow you'll give a presentation on the evolution of species from the first creature to walk the earth until the present day. - Sir? - Yes. What's the evolution process of Jinn? I mean, what's the origin of their species... Jinn were here before any other species. They have no ancestors. I also read that they would do anything to reproduce with a human, right? Not necessarily. Jinn can choose to unite with their summoner in order to stay here. But in the end, it's their choice. It's not a necessity, as this would severely harm their summoner. - How do you know so much about Jinn? - Thank you for your input. What was your name again? - Kerasquioxian... - Keras. His name is Keras. He's Layla's cousin. - Yes, our Bedouin cousin. - Yeah. He's here for a visit. OK. Going back to Darwin, now. Hassan. Hassan! ...and going to number two, there is competition within each species for food, living space, water, and mates. So, going now to number three, which says "survival of the fittest." - I need to talk to you. - Fahed, not now. I've been trying for two days. I want to work things out. I'm the one who's trying to work things out. - You humiliated me this morning. - And you did, too! You need to understand the other person's point of view. Like in Petra, you only thought about yourself. I would never let my girlfriend talk like that. Then find another girlfriend. Mira, don't shout. Everyone is staring. And what's with that new kid, anyway? That's Layla's cousin, Fahed. If you want to be with me I'd better not see you together. You're kidding, right? You don't get to tell me who I talk to. Mira, don't shout. Everyone is staring. You know what, Fahed? I'm done. We're done. This, here? Done. - You must be kidding. - Don't you ever talk to me again. You're supposed to be my friend, not just assign me the status of your girlfriend. Follow me. Bro, forget it. Let's have a cigarette break. This isn't over. She's just too emotional. What's his problem? Layla, shut the door. Mira, you shouldn't have talked to him like that. What? - He was just trying to... - Trying what? To control me? It's over, Layla. I'm done with him. And you... Why don't you go find your summoner? It's lunch break. The summoner must be out there. What are you doing here? - I... - What are you waiting for? It's not like that. I mean, I can't just... - What do you mean, you can't? - The summoner... What are you hiding? I'm not hiding anything. The Jinn needs to be with the summoner. And I need your help to find the summoner. When we find them I'll take the Jinn back to our realm. It's that simple. But why are you still here? What do you mean? What do you want from me? Are you here to hurt us? - I don't trust him. - You know what? - I'm tired of all this. - What's this? Mira, no. Don't! Mira, what have you done? What happened? Where is he? - What did you throw at him? - Sand. Sand? Where did you get that? And why are you carrying it in your bag? I took it from Hassan. Don't, Mira! Mother, did you see that? - There's no time... - Hosny! Hosny's back! Hosny! What? - How did you know I was there? - Because I looked for you everywhere. I was worried about you. Because I care about you, Yassin. - Want me to tell you a story? - Go ahead. A long time ago, there was a girl. She had no friends. She was living in an unfair world, and she couldn't fit in in such a world, where some individuals persecuted others... and exploited them in the name of the law. And that was enough. She decided it was enough. So they locked her up. But the story didn't end there. And it definitely won't end that way. Because a young man showed up... called out to her... and set her free. This young man... is you, Yassin. And this... This... This is me. But you should know that the individuals I just told you about are not human. They are Jinn. And one of them... is coming after me, and after you too. Layla? Subtitle translation by Nancy Nasser
