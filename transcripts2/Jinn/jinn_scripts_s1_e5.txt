 A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES Someone help me! Anyone! - Anyone there? - Hassan? - Hassan? - Mira! We have to get out, now! - What's happening? - I don't know. - Help me! - I'm coming. Listen, about what happened at the hospital, I just want to say that... Look, I didn't want to get physical with you either. I don't know, but...

 all the shit that's happening to us... I think I know what's going on. Tell me. I'm going to get a beer. You want one? Yeah, sure. I beg you. The last time I saw her she was coming down the stairs with Keras. And all of a sudden, they disappeared. Your son knows where my daughter is. Try to understand. My daughter is missing, and in danger. And it's your son's fault. Son, neither of us can do anything until the Jinn possessing him leaves. Don't tell me I can't do anything! I won't let anything happen to my daughter, understand?

 - Khaled, calm down. - Excuse me. - Where are you going, Omar? - I need some fresh air. Ma'am, I know how hard this is for you. But I'm begging you, some kids are still missing. Please, my child, my son has suffered enough. Keras? Keras? - Omar. - Keep it down. Omar, you have to help me. - Mira is in danger. - Just keep it down. - I beg you, you have to help us. - Listen to me... My daughter is still missing. And we're not leaving until we know where she is. Do you understand? Calm down, please. We can save everyone. But you have to get me out of here. Easy. Omar, I have to find Mira before it's too late. I need your help. Give me your hand. - The window. Help me out. - Listen... You're not an evil Jinn, are you? Omar, Mira is in danger. And I have to save her. What about Hassan? Hassan, too. Let's go. How did you get through here? I guess you do trust me, after all. Listen, we'll find them all. I promise. We're not leaving until... Omar, how did you get in there? Where's my son Hosny? He went to find Hassan and Mira. What are you doing here? It's dangerous. - Hassan, Layla's gone. - What do you mean, gone? I don't know. She disappeared at the party. - How come? - You were right. It's the Jinn. - See? I told you! - I know. But don't get too excited. We still have work to do. - I saw Yassin and Vera inside. - What? - Do you know where they are? - No. Yassin punched me and left. - Did they say anything? - No, he just punched me. - Did you see Keras? - Keras? Why is everybody coming here? - I need to find him. - Thank you for... I'm glad you showed up. I thought I was going to die. Thank you. - What? - Nothing. - What's wrong? - I need to pee. Let's go. OK, let's go. I don't get it. Yassin's house? Why would she be at Yassin's house? I don't know, man. That's what her dad said. Screw her, man. This really sucks. Come on, man. Listen, I'll be honest with you. With everything that's been happening, she's really messing with my mind. I just feel like my desire for her keeps getting stronger. I'll do whatever it takes to get her back. - Seriously, I'm in love with her. - Yeah, Romeo! Screw you. I'm serious, bro, you're really something. So? What's up? Listen, I have a theory about what's been happening to us. I hope it's good, because the last time I saw you two, things got a little... ridiculous. Ridiculous? Just listen to his theory then tell me about "ridiculous"! Go ahead. Keras kept telling me that he's a Jinn and that there's a second, evil Jinn, which is Vera. And that I was the one who summoned him. But I don't know who to believe. - Can I ask you something? - OK. Let's say, hypothetically speaking, that I ask you out to the movies or to have dinner, or to come over to my place... - Hassan... - What? - You really don't know? - What? - You know Leen? - Yes, I know Leen. - She's liked you since ninth grade. - Liar! - I swear! - No way! Leen? Yes, Leen. - And you? - What? Let's go this way. Come on. - That's impossible. - Seriously, it's not. I didn't believe it either at first, but really, there's no other explanation. We have to find a solution. It can't go on like this. - Like what? - Anything. Maybe we could ask someone. - Or do some research. - We need a solution. We can't just sit around like idiots. We're not idiots. It's just that there's nothing we can do. - We have to do something. - Why are you being such a pessimist? - We can ask. - Nasser? Layla? Where did you come from? What were you talking about? We were just talking about what's been going on. - Where did you come from? - Can I have a word with you, alone? Now? Yeah. What's the matter? - See? I told you! - She came out of nowhere. This is insane. - What's wrong? - I want to understand. We're going to a place where you can set me free. Will you just tell me what's going to happen to me? You'll finally be able to turn your life around. Isn't that what you want? Yassin... Unless we unite, I'll have to stay here in Petra and look for another summoner. "Unite"? Don't leave me. We can be together, Yassin. "Unite." Don't you want to be with me? OK. Don't you want to be part of a real family? What about my mom? I'm all she has. - That's not important. - After what happened to that jerk... - That's not important. - Why not? You'll still be able to take care of her if you want to. Can't you see? Can't you see how great our love will grow if we unite? Imagine us sharing the same body. Come on. Come on. Let's go. Follow me. This is where that Bedouin man showed up. But then he disappeared. Call Keras and see if he shows up. Maybe he can help. Keras? Keras, where are you? I need you. Keras, please. I can't go on without you. - Mira! - It worked! - Keras! - Keras? Keras! Keras! Hassan, do you have water? What happened, Keras? Are you OK? Quick. Talk to me, Keras. Come on. Keras. What happened? Keras, you're back. I missed you. Me too. Mira, I can't get up. This vessel is too weak. - Is there anything we can do? - No. This will be my last appearance. Yassin is about to make the biggest mistake of his life. He will unite with Vera. He'll lose his soul forever, and never be able to undo it. If you don't prevent this, no one will be safe. - You must stop him before it's too late. - Me? What... - Wait, Keras... - Keras? Wait! Beware of Vera's powers. I can't protect you anymore. Now what do we do? How are we supposed to find them? I think I know where they might be. There's only one place where Jinn and humans can unite. Ready? - Is it going to hurt? - You won't feel a thing. OK. Let's do this. One side stands for justice, the other for the law... - Layla, you've changed. - You too. How did I change? Layla... I need you to help me get Mira back. - Mira chose a different path. - What do you mean? She went with Keras. Keras? What? - I don't understand. - But she will regret it. She'll soon realize she picked the wrong side. Who are you? So if one of us gives the signal, the other must stick to the plan. Are you sure about this? Yes, we have to split up. I'll go around the back. Be careful, Hassan. You too. Look for the stairs that lead to the coliseum. Mira... Mira... Mira... Mira... Mira... Don't take the risk. I'm proud of you. Wait! Who's there? - Yassin, don't trust her. - Who's there? Hassan? She's lying to you. What are you doing here? - And what brought you here? - Vera, step away from him. - What did you do to Layla? - I didn't do anything to her. - What happened to Layla? - What did you do to Layla? - I did nothing to her. - What happened to Layla? - Yassin, listen... - Yassin, listen to Mira. I was there. I saw Layla disappear and I won't let her do the same to you. What? Who has been feeding you this bullshit? Keras? Why don't you tell him what happens when you two unite? Yes, please. You never gave me a straight answer. Hassan, tell him what happens when they unite. Yassin, listen to me. When a human unites with a Jinn, the human loses their soul forever. - What? - That's not true. She wants to control you. Look, I'm telling the truth. You don't want to go back to your old life, do you? Yassin, trust me. I would never hurt you. Like you didn't hurt Tareq? Tareq fell. Someone pushed him. You're the one who pushed him. I didn't. - Then who did? - Keras. I won't fall for your tricks. How do you think he convinced you to help? We're here to bring justice to the world and help those who have been wronged. What the fuck are you talking about? Nasser, I called and you answered. Layla, what's wrong with you? We must unite. - We're stronger together, and if we do... - "Unite"? - Are you serious? - This is important to me. Nasser, I need you. What for? To bring justice to the world? Yes. If you accept our bond, I can make your every wish come true. No, thanks. I thought you wanted us to be together. Didn't you say that? Listen, I never want to see you or hear from you again because you're not the Layla I know. - Understand? - Be careful what you wish for. Go to hell. Come on, Fahed. You're leaving too? Jimmy, let's go. Mira, will you drop the rock? This is ridiculous. Be careful. She's more powerful than you know. Vera, stay away from her! - Hassan, go. - No, Mira, I won't. Hassan, stick to the plan. Go. Mira... I can help you. I can find the person who killed your mother and brother. What are you doing? You're kidding, right? Let's go. I think I left my wallet in there. I'll go get it. You go on. I'll see you later. Let's go, Jameel. Layla... Listen... What did you mean when you said you can make wishes come true? You can really do that? Can we finish what we came here to do? Vera, I'm talking to you. Come on. Yassin... you're clearly not sure about this. And that's OK. I'm sorry, but... - Mira knows what she wants. - I know what I want. - She needs me. - I'm the one who needs you, not Mira! I'm the one who needs you. Come on. I'm right here, and I'm ready. I'm telling you, I'm ready. - Yassin, you don't need her... - Stay out of it. - How do you know what I need? - Believe me, you don't need her. - She was willing to ditch you just now. - I want this. Don't trust her, Yassin. Let's go back to Amman... and forget about all this. This is what I want. Let's do it. Think of your mother. Think about yourself. Mira, I'm too tired. No... I want this to end. Don't. Mira, your time is up. Now you're ready. Yassin! We're done. Yassin! Yassin? Yassin? Come on, Hassan. Vera, hang in there. - Can't we go in and get them? - It's too dangerous. Ra'ed! Ra'ed, come and help me. - Hassan! - Ms. Ola! Dad, what are you doing here? I looked for you everywhere. I was worried sick. - I'm sorry. - Omar... Hassan, I was worried sick about you. What happened? - What's this? - I'm so sorry. - I didn't expect all this to happen. - It doesn't matter. You're OK. - Was it worth it? - You'll see it on Amman Gossip. Trust me, everything will be fine. OK? Open the door. What's Vera doing here? Ms. Ola? Mira, are you OK? - Yeah. - Are you sure? Any news on Keras? No, Mira. Let's go home. Please. What happened? What happened? It's going to be fine. Where am I? Hello. You're alive? Can I come in? Why are you here? Will you tell me what really happened to Tareq? Please, I just need to understand. I'm not supposed to be here. I'm sorry... No... Wait. What happened to you? Where did you go? Keras... What's the matter? What did you just call me? Keras? Do you know who I am? I'm not Keras. I'm Hosny. I'm sure I've been here before, but... I think I know you, but... I don't know... I don't know why I'm here. You don't remember me? I don't know. I'm not supposed to be here. Are you doing this? Fahed? Subtitle translation by Nancy Nasser
