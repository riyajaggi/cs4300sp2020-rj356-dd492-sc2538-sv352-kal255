 A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES The Nabateans believed that their Jinn was mightier than the Romans'. Amazingly, the rules governing the two are very different and also different to those of humans. The Nabateans' Jinn used to believe in justice... Hassan... Could you give us a break from those Jinn stories? Doing this is hard enough. I mean going back after what happened. Sure. What else do you do at school? - Any sport? - What are you talking about?

 Or music? Anything? A bit of guitar. That's cool. Did you take it up for someone in particular? A girl maybe? - Ms. Ola, no! - He's doing it for Mira, by the way. You shithead. Don't bother with him. Thank you for believing me and taking me to Petra. I know how hard it is for you to go back to where we lost Tareq, but this is our only chance to stop it happening again. I just need to get some money and we'll head out. What is it? Nothing.

 You know, you're acting a bit weird. - Yassin? - Yeah? You couldn't finish him off. I know it's hard, but justice comes with a price. - Look... - I can break the bond between us. - What? - I can relieve you. - No way. - I just want to know you're ready... Vera, I want... Ready for what is yet to come. This is the best thing that's happened to me. And I'm willing to do anything for you... For us. OK? Let's go. What have you done to Layla? - I didn't do it. - What do you mean? - What did you do to her? Where is she? - I think a Jinn took over her body. A Jinn like Vera. And if one of them has already come out, it means they're all coming. She reacted to what I did to Fahed. I promised Layla everything would be OK. Now what do I tell her? - Answer me! What am I going to tell her? - We must find Vera immediately. My best friend is missing and that's all you can say? You need to stop being so selfish and start thinking about other people. That was my advice to you, by the way. Well, now you get to try it. Let's go. I'm sure she keeps it here somewhere. - Yassin, we need to talk. - So talk. - Yassin! - Yes, talk! What is it? - Things will be different after this trip. - So? So I need you to be sure, completely sure, that this is what you want. Is it me you're underestimating or is it yourself? I don't get it. Yassin, we need to move. I don't think anybody is home. What are we supposed to do? We need to get the hell out of here. I have to call my dad. - Mira? - Hi, Aunty. Hi. - What are you doing here? - I came to see Yassin. I rang the doorbell but nobody answered. Aunty, is everything OK? What's wrong? Zuhair is in the hospital. They're saying he's... brain-dead. We were having dinner with Yassin and Vera and he suddenly choked on a piece of steak. I'm sorry. Come on in. - Can I use your phone? - Of course. Go. Come in, please. Hello? Dad, it's me. Yassin? He was supposed to be here. - Why did you call Fahed? - You scared me! - I was about to call the police. - Dad, OK, sorry! - Don't worry. I'll be home by midnight. - Is Layla with you? I don't know where Layla is. Why are you asking? - They can't find her. - I thought she went home. I'm coming to get you. Thank you. Everything OK? - Yeah, my dad is coming to pick me up. - OK. Have a seat. Let me just check in on Yassin. I thought he went home. Strange. He's not picking up. Yassin? Where are you? Petra? What? Why are you going to Petra now? - Yassin? Hello? - We need to go, now. This means they know we're after them, right? - We can't wait for your father. - He won't let me go to Petra now. - Don't you want to help Layla? - How can you ask that? Of course I want to help Layla, but to be honest... What are you doing? Don't be scared. Hold onto me. What's happening, Keras? Keras! Mira? What the hell just happened here? Khaled? What's the matter? - Hi, Auntie. - Layla? - When did you get here, love? - A little while ago. How is he? They're saying he's stable for now. Don't worry, he'll be OK. Layla... Nasser, sweetheart... - You're awake. - Mom... Baby... Ms. Ola, something weird is going on. - All the Bedouins are talking about it. - What Bedouins? They say no one can enter the site. It's too dangerous. They're saying a kid went missing. I convinced them to take you to the kid's house. Hassan, what? Now? Yes, now! Come on, Ms. Ola, let's go. - This is our chance. - Hassan, we can't go with total strangers. This is connected to Tareq's death. It might be our only chance to solve this. He's right. - Come on, Ms. Ola. Omar will go with you. - Aren't you coming? I'll see if I can get more info from the guys here and do more research. It could be helpful. - Ready to go? - Let's do this. We have nothing to lose. Ready when you are, ma'am. Hassan, stay here and don't cause any trouble. I won't. I promise. Let's go, Omar. - Don't worry, you're safe with me. - I know. Let's go now. Keras? What the hell? Keras? There's Hosny! - He's alive. - He's alive! - He's possessed! Take him to his mother. - Come on. No! Where is Mira? Let me go! No! I have to find Mira. No! There's no time! I have to find Mira! Please! She's in danger! Let go of me! Mira! I don't know. We were all wasted. She probably went home or something. Text her or call her. But if you ask me, she's lying to you for sure. What? She's the one who brought Mira to the party. Exactly. She brought Mira to the party, then who showed up? Girls like her look chill on the outside. I don't know, but there's definitely something fishy. - Even with that kid. - Keras? Yeah. Look! That bastard Hassan is in Petra, looking for Jinn! As you may know, Petra is closed because of the Jinn there. And I'm heading there right now... Under hashtag "Jinn Hunter." to try to catch one of the Jinn. - "Jinn Hunter"? - Yeah, bro. I don't know how anyone can be that stupid. Bro, what happened last night? The Rose City is now a ghost town. And fear has taken over its inhabitants. We heard from multiple sources that the accident was not a coincidence. We hope these rumors are not true. Since they cannot be proven scientifically, but... I hope this works. In the name of Jinn, emerge. In the name of Jinn, emerge... In the name of Jinn, emerge. In the name of Jinn, emerge... In the name of Jinn, emerge... - What are you doing? - I compel you to leave! What the hell? What have you done? What was that? The ancient city closed its doors until further notice. The chief of Petra's police force denounced the accident and insisted that the accident was the first of its kind. He also appealed to visitors not to let this affect their tours. Now we return to our program about the history of Petra. The city of Petra was built around the year 312 BC... Hello. His mother won't see anyone. She says her son is possessed by a Jinn. - Jinn? - Omar... Why does she believe that? Did she witness anything strange? - Hello. - Hello. What's your name? - Sumaya. - That's a nice doll, Sumaya. Hosny got it for me. - Who's Hosny? - My brother. That's him. He came out of the sand, and he was looking for a girl called Mira. Ms. Ola, come check this out. - What is it? - Keras. Do you know him? - Is this your brother? - Yes. Did you really think that throwing sand at a Jinn would work? Yeah, it sounds stupid now. Nobody believed it anyway. I tried to convince them but you know how skeptical people are. Also, when I was a little kid I used to say weird stuff all the time. So they usually dismiss whatever I say, but this time it's different. This time, I really believe I'm right. - Do you care about what people say? - Yes. It matters for them and for me. I don't want to be the guy that nobody talks to and girls avoid. If I can prove that all these crimes are related to Jinn... Who said they were crimes? Sometimes you must do what you think is right, no matter what others say and whatever the consequences. Once, my daughter... left the house without my permission. I yelled at her. I grounded her. But she didn't care. The next morning, she ran away. I found out she was taking care of a sick horse. - A sick horse? - Yeah. A sick horse. She did what she thought was right. You want to know where the Jinn are? Sure. See that cave? The one that looks like a skull? Kneel down and listen. And if the Jinn calls, answer it. Can I call the Jinn instead? Yes. But it has to be from your heart. Sign here. Excuse me. - Ms. Ola? - Khaled, hi. Any news? We went to the missing kid's house. They say he's possessed. What? - He looks exactly like Keras. - The new kid? - I think he knows where Mira is. - I'm on my way. OK. Bye. - Did they find Mira? - No, Omar. - Did you tell Hassan that we're leaving? - I can't find him. What? Did you call him? He's not answering. I looked and he's not in his room. - Are you messing with me, Omar? - I'm not. - I told you, I know nothing about him. - Omar, we need to leave... Hang on a second. Let me check Amman Gossip. Look. Petra is closed because of the Jinn there. And I'm heading there right now. Is he insane? Is that kid insane? I'm going to kill him! Here's the cave. Do you think the Jinn know who is after my friends? Inside, you'll find the answers you seek. Just make sure you're asking the right questions. I wanted to ask you... What the hell? OK. What am I supposed to be looking for? Yassin, you scared me. What are you doing here? We have to get out before dark... - What are you doing here? - A Bedouin just picked me up... Question! Was it you who summoned the Jinn? I... I think so, yeah. I think I just did. You can't tell anyone you saw us. This is for your own good. I don't know what to say. I can't remember a thing from that day. I don't even know where I got the knife from... or how I cut my throat. I believe you, Nasser. I'm here for you. Layla, regardless of anything that's happened... you know I love you, right? - There he is! - Hey, Jim! - Thank you! - My man! How are you doing? - Good. How's everything? - All good. - Thank you. - Who branded you? - How's everything? - Fine. You shouldn't have come. - We came to check on you. - Well, Layla, here you are. I don't mean anything, it's just that you disappeared from the party last night. - What party? - Mira's birthday party. It was great. You really missed out. - Weren't you postponing it? - No. Fahed threw a party for Mira... to patch things up with her. Yeah. To patch things up with Mira. Also... to set me up with his friend... Naji. That Naji? No, man, the party was for Mira. Naji just happened to be there. How could you do this, man? You piece of shit! What's wrong with you? How could you do that? What's wrong with you? - What's gotten into you? - So you're a man, now? - Khaled. - Hello. - Hassan? - They found Hosny and took him home. I know this sounds crazy but... I don't care who he is. He knows where Mira is. - And Hassan? - We'll find him. - Let's go. - Let's go. Keras! Where are you? You can't just leave me here. - Mira! - Keras! Come on! It's getting dark. Keras? Somebody help me! It's happening! Help! Anyone? Subtitle translation by Nancy Nasser
