 All right. Where's Arnold? Arnold who? No use protecting him, Mr. Drummond, 'cause I'll find him. Arnold, come on out. Willis, what's the matter? This is somethin' between me and Arnold. Where is he? I think he went up the stairs. No, I think he's in the kitchen. No, I think he's on the patio. Next, you two will be tellin' me he don't live here anymore. Who don't live here anymore? Uh-huh. So, there you are. Come on. Oh, hi, Willis. When did you get home? Come on, Arnold. Will you excuse us, please? This is private. I'll stay here, then you can have it real private. Come on. Hey, I don't know what's going on here, but no rough stuff, huh? Don't worry, Mr. Drummond. I want to talk to Arnold. Honest. All right, so what do you got to say for yourself? About what? About why you let that dude push you around the schoolyard. About why you wouldn't fight him back. About why you ran like a scared chicken. You'd run, too, if a guy bigger than you tried to screw you into the ground. Look, Arnold, Stuart the Gooch has been pushin' you around for the last two weeks. You gotta fight that bully and make him afraid. Yeah, afraid he'll kill me. Look, Arnold, you got two choices. A. You'll be pushed around by bullies for the rest of your life. Or B. Tomorrow you fight like a man. I'd like to talk about C. What's C? See you later. I'm not gonna fight that monster, Willis. Monster? He's only two inches taller than you. Not when you're layin' on the ground lookin' up, he ain't. Arnold, everybody has to fight a bully sometimes in their life. You gotta take a stand. It's all part of growing up. Okay, that's when I'll fight the Gooch. After I've grown up. All right, Arnold. Then I'll just tell Mr. Drummond what a coward you are. He'll talk some sense into you. You think he wants a coward for a son? Oh, Willis, please don't say anything to him. Well, somebody's gotta make a man out of you. What's the rush? I'm barely out of toilet training. Well, I won't tell Mr. Drummond under one condition. That you fight the Gooch tomorrow. I'm gonna be too busy tomorrow. Doin' what? Lookin' for a place to hide. Well, that's the only deal you're gonna get. It's important that you fight him. You promise, I promise. Well, can we use something besides my fists? Like what? Your fists. Arnold, it's gotta be my way. Now, you fight the Gooch, and I won't tell Mr. Drummond. Is it a deal? Well, it's a deal. All right. What's a deal? Oh, somethin' we got goin' after school, Mr. Drummond. Wow. You guys must be involved in something very important. Oh, it's not that important. Yes, it is. Like I said, yes, it is. Why do I get the feeling that there's a lot more going on here than you guys want to tell me? 'Cause it's personal, Mr. Drummond. Well, you're entitled to your own secrets. So I'll get out of your way. I'll see you guys later. I'll be down at my office. Look, Arnold. Now, I didn't say anything to Mr. Drummond about you runnin' from the Gooch. Now, I kept my part of the deal. Right. Now, you gotta fight the Gooch tomorrow to keep your part. You took the best part. Look, Arnold, I know how you feel, and I know you're scared, but this is somethin' you gotta do to save face. Well, if you really want to save my face, keep it away from the Gooch. Get up, Arnold. It's a big day today. Fight day. Ouch. Come on, Kimberly. I gotta use the bathroom! Just a minute. Oh, come on. Open up. It's all yours. Good morning. Time to comb your locks and grab your socks. What's the matter, Arnold? Arnold, are you sick? Oh, Arnold. Oh, it's nothin'. I'll be all right, if I live. Your temperature's normal. Don't let that fool you. I got... I got headaches, stomachaches, and I'm seein' spots. What kind of spots? Mmm. The worst kind. Round ones. I think I ought to call Mr. Drummond. Hi, Mrs. Garrett. Good morning, Willis. Come on, Arnold, out of bed. Oh, I'm real sick, Willis. Please bring my goldfish so I can say goodbye. If I ever heard a phony... You're just fakin' 'cause you're afraid to go fight the Gooch today. Did you say something, Willis? I think I'm getting delirious. Arnold. I hear you're not feeling well. What's the matter? I think he has yellow fever. I don't think so. But he may have that Russian flu that's going around. Hey, that's it. Somethin' that looked Russian flew right by me. Your head feels cool, but you never know. You just take it easy, son. I'm gonna call the doctor, just to be sure. Doctor? I don't need no doctor. Sure you do. No tellin' what they'll find when they look inside of you. Where they gonna look? Now, don't frighten him, Willis. Maybe all Arnold needs is a shot. Mr. Drummond, don't shoot me. Look, I'm cured. What's going on here? I've heard of miracle cures, but this is ridiculous. Arnold, I think I might have to tell Mr. Drummond. He's a man. He'll understand. No, don't. Understand what? There's a bully in the playground who's been pushin' Arnold around. Yesterday, Arnold ran home 'cause he was too chicken to fight. I knew there was something going on between you two yesterday. The bully's a lot bigger than me. Where I stop, he's just beginnin'. Oh, come on, Arnold. He's a normal-sized bully. Arnold was pretendin' to be sick 'cause he was too chicken to fight. Arnold, is that true? Well, kind of. Well, then this is a serious matter. That's what I've been tellin' him. This isn't something you can just run away and hide from. You listen to Mr. D. Now the only way to handle this is man-to-man and face-to-face. Tell it like it is. I want you to call up that boy, arrange to meet him, and talk this thing out. Right on. That's the same... Say what? Listen, Willis. Fighting rarely settles anything. Come here. I remember once when I was a little boy, this other kid and I were standing nose-to-nose, both of us scared stiff, and praying that somebody would stop us from hitting each other. But Mr. Drummond... Don't interrupt. He's makin' a lot of sense. Continue, please. Mr. Drummond, how's my little brother gonna talk when Stuart the Gooch is tap dancin' on his head? Stuart the Gooch? Yeah. And don't call him that unless you're ridin' by on a bus. Mr. Drummond, Arnold's got to fight that dude, or people'll call him a coward. No, Willis. Anyone can fight, but it takes real courage to talk things out. Especially when you got a mouthful of loose teeth. Willis, I know that you mean well for Arnold. But fighting won't necessarily solve anything. Well, I say it will. 'Cause if Arnold keeps running away, people are gonna pick on him and laugh at him. Now, I'm not asking him to run. I'm asking him to talk. Now, Arnold, promise me that you'll talk this thing out with, what's his name, the Gurch. Gooch. Do I have your promise? Yes, sir. And I say it with feeling. Thank you. And I'm very proud of you, 'cause you have the courage not to fight. I've had it all my life. All right, I'll see you guys at breakfast. Arnold, you should be hangin' your head in shame. I don't care how it hangs, just as long as it stays attached. Arnold, you gotta fight the Gooch. I can't. I just gave my promise. Arnold, Mr. Drummond don't understand. Talkin' might work in his fancy world, but it don't work in the streets where we come from. Like Papa said, we got a name to live up to. And the key word there is "live." Arnold, you got nothin' to worry about, 'cause the Gooch is the one in trouble. What you talkin' about, Willis? Arnold, ain't I your big brother who loves you and worries about you, and takes care of you? "And takes care of you?" Yes, Willis. Well, it's the truth. And you know I wouldn't want to see you get hurt in any way. I suppose so. I'm scared, Willis. Well, you don't have to be. Because I'm gonna teach you how to fight and whip the Gooch. I'm gonna be behind you all the way. Well, if you really love me, you'd get in front of me. Arnold, I can't. This is something you have to do by yourself. I knew there was a catch. Now, what we're gonna do, we're gonna phone the Gooch and make him think that you're crazy. If I phone him, he'll know I'm crazy. That's our whole strategy. We get the Gooch thinkin' that you're crazy, 'cause people are afraid of crazy people, you've won half the battle. Hey, if we've already won half, let's give Gooch the other half and call it a draw. Arnold, just trust me. Now, let me see you act crazy. I meant on the phone. Oh. Hiya, Gooch. This is crazy Arnold Jackson callin' you. What do I say? Tell him you're bad and crazy. Hi, Gooch, I'm bad and crazy. Are you tryin' to throw the phone call? Now, tell him you're loud and crazy. Go ahead. Hi, Gooch. I'm loud and crazy! That's it. Keep goin'. Tell him you're bad and crazy. Hey, Gooch. I'm bad and crazy. That's it now. Keep goin', keep goin'. Now, listen here, Gooch. Crazy Arnold Jackson's gonna stomp all over you. So you better watch it, turkey. Now, hang up, hang up. What'd he say? He didn't say anything. He just barked. That's just a cover-up. He's really scared. Not as scared as I am. See, if I fight, Mr. Drummond's gonna get mad at me. And if I don't fight, you're gonna get mad at me. Right. Which brings us to the Gooch, who can kill me without even being mad at me. All right now, go faster, faster. Come on, faster, go faster. I can't go any faster. If I go any faster, I may take a nap in the middle of round one. Arnold. Let me just see you throw your right. That's not your right, that's your left. I know it. That's how I'm gonna confuse him. Come on, now, let me see your Muhammad Ali shuffle. Come on. Hey, you got it. Oh, man, when the Gooch sees that, he's gonna run all the way home. If he don't, I'm gonna run all the way to New Jersey. Come on, keep it up, keep it up. Keep it movin', come on. All right now. Throw a left. Right. Left-right combination. Don't close your eyes. Because every time you throw a combination, you close your eyes. Well, I can't help it. My fists want to fight, but my eyes don't want to see me get hit. Come on, keep it movin'. Come on. Now, get mean, real mean. Tell me how mean you are. I'm mean. How mean? I'm so mean I'm scarin' myself. Hey, what are you boys doin'? Willis is teachin' me to... Dance. Right. To dance. You're... You're certainly light on your feet, fella. Thank you, honey. Arnold, it looked more to me like you were throwin' punches. Yeah, that's the name of the new dance, the Punch Shuffle. Now, if Mr. Drummond catches you practicin' fightin', you're gonna switch from the Punch Shuffle to the Bruised Bottom Blues. Mrs. Garrett's right. Don't worry about it. Hey, can't we settle this whole thing by buying the Gooch a nice present? Listen, Arnold, man, you got the moves, and you got the punches. Now you can take that Gooch. Now let's get goin', champ. "Champ"? Me? Well, that's what I called you, champ. Yeah, yeah. That's me. Look how I bulge all over. Ooh! Like iron. You know what? Think I'll get me a T-shirt with my picture on the front and "Mean Dude" on the back. Are you ready, champ? Yeah. Let's go pluck that turkey. Come on. Keep it up. Come on. You gonna take him. You're ready. Come on, keep it up. Come on, let's go. Let's go, champ. Let's go. Yes. Hey, fellas. Where are you off to? Oh, we're goin' down to talk to the Gooch, Mr. Drummond. Wonderful. I'm glad you took my advice. To talk. Yeah. I'm gonna talk all over him. Are you ready, champ? Am I ready? ♪ Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee ♪ Muhammad Arnold, the champ, that's me ♪ Yeah. Come on. If Mr. Drummond finds out we've been fightin', we're gonna get it. Don't worry, he won't. Trust me. Is it still all swollen up? No, it's nothin'. "Nothin'"? It hurts so bad, my shoes ache. Well, it don't look that bad. Hmm. How're we gonna keep Mr. D from seein' it? Well, we'll stay away from him till the welt on your eye's okay. Won't that take a while? No, your eye only has to go from black to brown. I guess I didn't do so good, huh? Are you kiddin'? Man, you stood up to the Gooch great. I fell down even better. Man, I'm proud of you, Arnold. I really am. Hey, don't do that. My hand's connected to my eye. Well, let's get going before someone notices us. Put your glasses back on. Mrs. Garrett. Arnold, why are you wearing dark glasses in the house? It keeps the sun out of my eyes. There's no sun in your eyes. See? It works. Let's get going. Oh, I'm sorry, Mrs. Garrett. Very sorry. Never happen again. Happy birthday, too. Bye. Hi, fellas. Come here. I want to hear how everything went down at the playground. Oh, it went fine, Mr. Drummond. Real cool. Arnold, why are you staring at the wall? It's a new game. A new game? Yeah. You stare at the wall. Mmm-hmm. And if it don't fall down, you win. With my luck, it'll fall down. Arnold, would you come down here, please? I said, come down here. Yes, sir. What is going on? Why are you wearing sunglasses? Oh, Arnold, what happened to your eye? Everything. I'm afraid I know exactly what happened. You do? Yes, and I just feel terrible about it. This is all my fault. I'm sure glad to hear that. You took my advice, you went down there to talk, and the Gooch hit you. Right? Well, sort of. What do you mean, sort of? What went on down there? Come on, Arnold. I want to know. Did you go down there to talk or didn't you? All right, Mr. Drummond. Arnold went down there to talk with his fists. And my fists had nothing to say. Man, he was great, Mr. Drummond. You should have seen him. Arnold was dancin' to the left, then he was dancin' to the right. And then the music stopped. Arnold never cried once, Mr. Drummond. Not really. I cried a little bit out of this eye. But there was no room for the tears to come out of this one. Arnold. I am very disappointed in you. You broke your promise to me. No, he didn't. It was my idea. You know, Arnold has to learn to defend himself like a real man. Oh, I see. Unless a guy hits another human being, he's not a real man, huh? Well, let me tell you something. Albert Einstein never hit another human being, and he was quite a man. And when did you hear of Martin Luther King fighting with his fists? But, Mr. Drummond, that's not the same. And the thing that really bugs me, is that you knew how I felt. We discussed this. And you deliberately disobeyed me. Well, look, Mr. Drummond, I've been livin' with Arnold all of his life, and I think I know what's best for him. Well, I don't think so. In this household, there's only room for one father. Is that clear, Willis? Now, go to your room. It wasn't all Willis' fault, Mr. Drummond. I helped. Well, I'm mad at you, too. Thanks. Now, Arnold, I don't want you to think that there's never a time to fight. Sometimes, unfortunately, there is. But only after you've tried every other possibility. Do you understand that? Mmm. Yes, sir. Good boy. How does that eye feel? Like it ain't got a friend in the world. Okay, you go up with Willis and I'll get Mrs. Garrett to bring up something to put on it. And work on Willis, will you? Try and get him to see things our way. Okay? Okay. Hey, what're you doin'? I'm packin'. Me and Mr. Drummond don't see things the same. I'm going back to Harlem. No, you ain't. I ain't lettin' you go nowhere. Give me that stuff! I'm leavin'. No, you ain't. No one's splittin' this family up. Get out of my way. You ain't leavin' without a fight, you dummy. You're my big brother and I love you. Would you knock it off? Get out of my way, short stuff. I mean it. Mr. Drummond says there's a time to talk and a time to fight. And this is a time to fight. You mean, you'd really fight me? If I have to. Even though we both know I'd end up dustin' this room with your head, you ain't afraid? Not after what you taught me today. I need you and I ain't lettin' you go no place. Then I ain't goin', champ. Hey, what's this? Somebody going someplace? Oh, no. It's just something... We're just cleaning out our drawers, right, little brother? Right, big brother. Hey, that eye is really something, isn't it? Mmm-hmm. Did you at least get in one good lick? Mmm. I swung four times at the Gooch, but I only hit him once. Well, it's not too bad, huh? The other three times, I hit myself. Well, I hope you guys learnt your lesson about fighting. Shoot, I sure have. There's to be no more fightin', unless it's absolutely necessary. Not even pillow fightin'. Right. Oh, well, come on. Let's not overdo it. There's nothing wrong with a little pillow fight. Are you thinking what I'm thinking? You got that, champ. Let's go. Oh, hey, come on. That's not fair. That's two against one.
