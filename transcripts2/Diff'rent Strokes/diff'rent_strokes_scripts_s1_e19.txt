What are you and me gonna do on our spring vacation next week? Well, Arnold, me and my pal, Vernon, him and me, we are talkin' about goin' to baseball camp. Willis, you left something out of that "we." Me. And if that "we" don't include "me," you got a bad "we," there. Arnold, you can't come to baseball camp with us. You're too young.

 You gotta be at least 12 years old. Maybe I can look older. I'll lower my voice and paint on some pimples. Forget it. Well, will you at least take me to some movies with you? Arnold, go rent someone your own age to play with. Okay, go to the movies without me, but it'll cost you. What do you mean? Without me, you won't have anybody to buy you a half-price ticket. You'll have to go up to the box office on your knees. Daddy, what are we gonna do on our spring vacation? Well, frankly, I've been so busy I haven't given it any thought. I know what I'm gonna do on my vacation. I think I'll call Paul Newman and ask him if he'd like to take me to Paris. Paul Newman? You're right. He's too old for me. Maybe I'll give John Travolta a buzz. Morning, everybody. Morning. Morning, Arnold. Hey, I just got a great idea. Why don't we all do something together on spring vacation? That's a terrific idea. That's great. We'll have so much fun. Where are we gonna go? Oh, who cares? Just as long as we're going together. Arguin' and yellin' and shovin' and overeatin'. That's my idea of a vacation. You know what might be exciting? Why don't we go on a cuise ship? We can just relax, and sit around, and read -That's boring. When you get to my age, boring is exciting. Hey, how about going to Africa. We can take a raft down the River Gambia and say "what's happening". And you can also drop into an alligators mouth. You're the right size for an hors d'oeuvre. Drummond Travel Service. Why, it's just a little local humor, operator. Long distance? Who's calling? Larry Alder from Portland? Why, put him on. Who's he? He's an old army buddy of mine. We were the craziest guys in the company. Always together, buddies to the end. When's the last time you saw him? About 15 years ago. But we keep in touch. I have to. He still owes me four bucks. Hey, Larry! You big lug! How's the goldbrick lieutenant? Phil, you old son of a gun. How's my favorite insubordinate sergeant? Couldn't be better. I miss you. Hey, where's that four bucks you owe me? Operator, I got a bad connection. You got it backwards, pal. You owe me the four bucks. I won the bet. No, no, no. I remember the night we made the bet. I drank more martinis standing on my head than you did. Standing on your head? Didn't the olives go up his nose? Hey, Larry, have you still got that radio show? No. You have that radio show. Congratulations on buying the station. What? What station? Where I work. That's why I called you. Aren't you one of the big mucky mucks of Trans Allied Incorporated? Well, just a little mucky muck. I'm on the board. Well, little mucky muck, your company just bought the station. Really? I guess I better start staying awake in the meetings. Yeah, why don't you get a belly dancer to read the minutes? I knew we bought a conglomerate in Portland that owned a radio station. As a matter of fact, I got the papers right here. But I didn't know it was the station where you do your show. Well, you're my boss now, pal. And I'm really looking forward to a happy and long relationship. Larry, are the call letters on your station K-L-O-W? Yeah. K-Low. The "K" is for "K," and the "Low" is for my salary. Which I'd like to talk to you about. Hey, come on, Phil, laugh it up a little. Your new employee just made a funny. Huh? Oh, yeah. Larry, it might not be a bad idea if I came out there to see what we bought. Hey, that would be delightful, de-lovely, and deductible. I'd love for you to meet my two kids, Diane and Ruthie. Well, I'd love for you to meet my family. Maybe I'll bring my daughter and my two new sons with me. New sons? Did you get married again? No, I'm not married. Phil, you old son of a gun. You've been standin' on your head drinking martinis again, huh? Hey, I'll explain it all when I see you. Listen, this call must be costing you a fortune. No, it's costing you. You own the station. Well, I'll get in touch. I'm gonna let you know when I'm coming. Thanks for calling, Larry. Kids, our vacation problems may be solved. I have to make a business trip to Portland, Oregon. How would you all feel about coming along with me? You, too, Mrs. Garrett. That's great! All right! You hear that? Portland, Oregon! Oh, boy! Where is it? It's near Seattle. I'd love to go. It'll give me a chance to visit my sister, Beverly. She's only an hour away. Good. Excuse me, gang. I gotta phone my office. What's it like in Portland, Mrs. Garrett? Big pine forests and wide rivers, and any minute you expect Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy to come out from behind a tree, singing in each other's face... ♪ When I'm calling you ♪ What's the matter kids? Why did they sing like that? Were they deaf? No. I'll tell you what, kids. I won't try to explain Jeanette and Nelson to you, and don't you try to explain Alice Cooper to me. What's it like in Portland? Oh, you can do all sorts of things there. You can camp, fish, hike. Anything you want. And there's no pollution like here in New York. You breathe clean air. Clean air? Won't that scare our lungs? Man, it'd be weird breathin' what you can't see. Oh, Daddy, we're all so excited about going to Portland. Yeah, I'm excited, too. You don't look excited. Maybe you got a problem with your exciter. Daddy, what's the matter? I'm afraid maybe I do have a problem. My company did buy the radio station where my friend Larry works, and we've gotta make a very big decision about that. What is it, Mr. Drummond? Well, we need to make the station more efficient, automated. That means replacing people with machines. Here I am, going to visit a guy I think the world of. I'd hate to have to tell him he's gonna be out of a job. Isn't there anything you can do about it? Well, it's not for sure, yet. We're waiting for our computer to analyze some data and help us make a decision on it. Gee, Daddy, that'd be terrible if you had to fire an old friend. I feel sorry for him. So do I, Arnold. Mr. D, before you give your friend the axe, maybe you better get your four bucks back. Come on, fish! Come on, take that bait! Come on, fish. I'm waitin'. Here we are! I got a big one. A big one! Here we are. It looks like you hooked me, Arnold. You make a terrific salmon, Mrs. Garrett. Thank you, dear. I'll be even more terrific when I learn to swim upstream. I'm afraid I have to throw you back, though. Why? You're too small. You sure know how to sweet-talk a salmon. Hello, hello. It's the Creature from the Black Lagoon. Looks like you'll need a harpoon for this one, Arnold. I got everything I need to go to Portland. I got my water skis, my diving suit, my snorkel and my flippers. You only need one more thing. What's that? You need to learn how to swim. Come on, blood, you know I know how to swim good, now. No, you don't. Now you remember that time... Boys! Boys! Boys, cool it! Stop acting like brothers! Hey, everybody, how do you like my new bathing suit? Where is the rest of it? That's it. It's a bikini. You look darling, Kimberly. Thank you, Mrs. Garrett. Hey, listen, gang. I... Say, that's a nice bathing suit you're almost wearing. Well, it was a choice between this and a one-piece. Well, I'm glad you took both pieces. Hey, look, kids. We're all set. There are the tickets to Portland. Hurray! All right! How far is Portland from here, Mr. D? It's about 3,000 miles. Three... It'll take us a month to get there. No, Arnold. It'll take about five hours. Five hours? What kind of train are we goin' on? Oh, we're not going on a train. They got jet buses now? Arnold, we're gonna fly. What you talkin' about, Mr. D? I said we're gonna fly there. That's the quickest way. Then leave me your address, and I'll look you up when I get there. Now, why do you say that, Arnold? What's the matter? You can't do that to us, Arnold. I'm not flying. I'm not flying. No! We don't have time to get there any other way. We have to take a plane. Well, if something goes wrong with that plane, who's going to get out and push? Arnold look, be reasonable. Now here's the situation. We're all going to go to Portland. The only way we can get there is flying. We'll all be together. What do you say? I say no way, no how, no time, and no chance. Get the picture? I don't understand, Arnold. Why are you afraid to fly? I got to be eight without going up in a plane, and I don't want to fool around with success. Come on, Arnold. Now, you know I've never been up in a plane, either. But I'm lookin' forward to it. Arnold, I've been up in a plane lots of times. It's nothin'. That's what worries me. Nothing is holding that plane up. Of course something is holdin' it up. Certainly. It's aerodynamics. It's a combination of thrust, lift, wind, speed and gravity. Yeah. But what holds it up? Arnold, you know, I think you're a chicken. Maybe I am. But you never heard of a chicken bailing out at 20,000 feet. Arnold, I never knew you felt this way about airplanes. I don't want anything to do with anything that flies. If I was a bird, I'd walk south for the winter. Come on, Arnold. You gotta fly. You're gonna ruin my vacation. All right, now. Come on, hold it, hold it. Now listen, everybody. We're not gonna force this on Arnold. We have to consider his feelings, too. That's right. Come on. So we won't say any more about it. Okay. Your bikini is adorable. They have them in your size, Mrs. Garrett. Oh, really? Listen, Arnold. I don't want to bug you about it, but I've seen lots of movies, and flyin' is no different from ridin' in a bus. Run that by me again. I mean it. When you get on the plane, you just keep sayin' to yourself, "I'm ridin' on a bus. I'm ridin' on a bus." What happens when I ask to get off at 125th Street? Now, come on, Arnold. This fear you're buildin' up is all in your mind. No, a lot of it has leaked down into my body. Listen Arnold. I'm going to prove to you that there's Nothing to be afraid of. Now pretend that this room is a big 747. I'll be your pilot, and you know what you can be, -I'll be a person on the ground waving goodbye. Have a nice trip! Come on Arnold, now sit down. You be the passenger. -Uh huh -What's the matter? How come i'm the only passenger on this plane? Come on Arnold, there's a lot of other passengers. They're just so relaxed they're sleeping. ok? - Ok. Is there an emergency exit near me? Sure. This plane is full of them. If you're trying to relax me, you just said the wrong thing. Now hold it Arnold, now this is your flight attendant, and he needs to make an announcement. Hi there, this is your flight attendant Willis Jackson. Today, we'll be serving all the milk and cookies and ice cream you want. And today, our movie is Superman! - I saw it. - well our other movie today is The Wiz! - I saw that too. - Well what would you like to see? I'd like to see and tell him what I think of him. Come on Arnold, we're about to take off so fasten your seat belts. - Click, click -This is your captain speaking Ready for take off ladies and gentlemen? -And now we're up in the air and captain Heely walks around and wraps with the passengers. Whats happenin' bud? How you doing cuz? Ahh Bro-ham! Hi there, relaxed passenger. Any questions? - Yeah, who's flying this plane? - You see young man, we got an automatic pilot. This is what you call a smooth flight. And this is what I call a smooth snow job. Come on Arnold, we're about to land in Portland. Anything special you want before we land? How about a paracute? - You wont be needing that son, we just... - made a perfect landing. Here we are in Portland. Thank you for flying Air Willis. Now you see Arnold, there's nothing to worry about right? - Right. - And flying in a plane is just like sitting in this room right? - Right. - Then you're going to fly to Portland right? - Right. As soon as you can get this room off the ground. I really tried to get Arnold to change his mind, Mr. D, but it didn't work. Well, gang, if he won't fly, I guess we're just gonna have to call off the trip. No, Mr. Drummond. I'll stay here with Arnold. No. He's my brother. I'll stay and give up my vacation. No, Willis. He's my little brother, too. You go and have a good time, and I'll stay here with Arnold. Well, if you're both stayin', so am I. Well, I guess I really do have to go for a few days. My friend, Larry, may be losing his job, and I don't want him to feel that I'm ducking out on him. Don't you worry, Mr. Drummond. The kids and I will have a terrific time together. No, I heard you. But I've given it some heavy thought, and, well, I'm just not bein' fair to the rest of you. So I changed my mind. I guess I have to fly to Portland. Hey! Good for you, Arnold. That's great. But I want Willis to hold my hand. You got it, little brother. And I want Mr. Drummond to hold my hand. Of course. And I want Kimberly and Mrs. Garrett to hold my hand. Arnold, you ran out of hands. They can hold my feet. You're very brave to make this sacrifice for the rest of us. No. That's okay. But first I gotta do something. What's that? Make out my last will and tenement. Daddy, relax. I've never seen you so nervous. Come on, Dad. Sit down and relax. Come on, Dad. Sit down and relax. Are you happy now? Yeah. Yeah. Good. What are you so nervous about, anyway? You said Mr. Drummond's a terrific guy. Well, of course, he's a terrific guy. Honey, I just haven't seen him in 15 years. It could be very embarrassing. He may have more hair than me. Or worse. My potbelly might be bigger than his. He'll probably turn out to be bald, fat, and ugly. Yeah. But when you're rich, who cares? He's really a great guy. See, we've had this running battle going on for years. He owes me $4, but he says I owe him $4. Why don't you pay him? I suppose you're too old to be left on a doorstep. Flight 23 from New York now unloading passengers at Gate 37 A. Did she say Gate 37 A? That's right. Then why are we waiting at Gate 37 B? I think it's perfectly obvious why. We're at the wrong gate! Ruthie, you better wait here for them. Why should I wait at the wrong gate? I don't trust airports. I still got luggage in Bangkok. Oh wait, what do the Drummond's look like? There's a Papa Drummond, a Housekeeper Drummond And three little Drummonds. What a dumb question. Hi. Hi. Are you lost? No. Are you? No, I live here. Here? In the airport? No, here in Portland. Well, I just got off the plane. I really love flying. Some people are scared. But not me. There's no time to be scared, either eating or going to the bathroom. Are you traveling alone? Uh-huh. I'm with my family. They're not off the plane yet. Well, how'd you get off so fast? It's easy when you can walk under people's legs. You're funny. How old are you? Eight, but I've been told I have the mind of a nine year old. How old are you? - I'm thirteen, but I've been told I have the mind of a fourteen year old. Maybe you should give your mind a rest for a year and give your body a chance to catch up. Do you have any brothers or sisters? One of each. They're here somewhere. Also, my father and Mrs. Garrett, our housekeeper. Father and a housekeeper? Uh-huh. Is your father's name Mr. Drummond? That's right. Hey, gee, I didn't know he was black. I didn't either, and I sat next to him on the plane. I'm here to meet you. My father's name is Larry Alder. I'm Ruthie. Hi, I'm Arnold. Hi. Daddy's freaked out. He can't find them. I found one of them. This is Arnold, Mr. Drummond's son. This is my sister Diane. Howdy. Hi. You're Mr. Drummond's son? Uh-huh. I'm black and so is my brother. Mr. Drummond's white, and so is my sister. That's the way it works out at our house. Hey that's wild Arnold. Oh, here they are! Gee, Arnold, you really have a colorful family. Black, white. And right now, they all look green. It was a bumpy flight. Some people can't handle flying. Excuse me. Mr. Drummond. Here is Ruthie and Diane. Ruthie and Diane, this is my family. Hi, Ruthie and Diane. Nice to meet you both. I'm sorry. Excuse me. I can't find them. Maybe they missed their flight. Hi, Phil. I mean, I've looked everywhere... Sarge, you old son of a gun. You great big lug. Son of a gun. Lug. Son of a gun. Lieutenant. Sarge. Son of a gun! Son of a gun! Big lug! Big lug! You look great. So do you. Where's that $4 you owe... Where's that $4 you owe... I'd like you to meet my daughters. Oh, I met them. They're lovely. I want you to meet my family. This is my daughter, Kimberly. My son, Willis, and my son, Arnold. Hi. ARNOLD: Hi. If I'm not saying anything, it's because I'm trying to think of something clever to say cleverly. Better hurry. We've only got a week. Oh, we've lived with Mr. D ever since our mama died. Oh. Well, you couldn't have picked a better father. Hold it, taxi. Well, I'm all set for Seattle. Mrs. Garrett, this is my friend, Larry, and his two daughters. How do you do, sir? Hello, girls. Hi. Nice to meet you. Well, I guess this is a little goodbye. Bye. Don't forget to change your socks. And your underwear! Your underwear. Is she talking to you or the kids? Me. Well, kids, let's get our luggage, we'll get a taxi to our hotel. Okay. Right on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What taxi? What hotel? I'm driving, and you're gonna stay with us. I haven't seen you in 15 years. Besides, my rates are cheaper. It's no problem, we'll double up. Well look what you're getting into. There's seven of us. So we'll cut one of the kids in half and make it come out even. I'm already a half. No, no, no, we're not going to put you out. Now look, don't argue with a lieutenant. That's an order sargent. - Yes sir. If it's okay with Mr. Drummond and Kimberly, she could stay with me at my friend Janet's house. Thanks a lot, Diane. That sounds like fun. Yeah. But is it okay with Janet? Why not? She stayed with us last week. She did? I was wondering why one of you suddenly had glasses and a big nose. Dad, that's a terrible joke. Wait till you hear some of Mr. D's jokes. Paging Mr. Philip Drummond. Mr. Philip Drummond, please pick up the courtesy telephone. Hey, that's us, Mr. D. How'd they know we were here? Well, my office knows my schedule, Arnold. See how important my new boss is, girls? Wherever he goes, they page him. Oh, yeah. Like you used to do, Daddy. Remember when you had yourself paged in that restaurant? Kids. - I don't know what's wrong with kids today. - Kids. -Who can understand anything they say. ♪ Why can't they be like we were ♪ ♪ Perfect in every way ♪ ♪ Oh what's the matter with kids... today Mr. Drummond, Mr. Phillip Drummond. Please pick up a courtesy telephone. Be back in a minute Larry. Dad, what's with that routine? - Oh we did shows in the army. We use to entertain the troops. - Ours or the enemies? This is Philip Drummond, operator. Yeah. Put him on, please. Hi, Eddie. Yeah. Are you sure? Oh, boy. Well, if you need to get in touch with me, I'll be at my friend, Larry Alder's, place. Yeah. My secretary has the number. Okay. Bye. What's the matter, Mr. D? Well, you remember that computer readout I told you kids about? Well, it came through. Bad news. Recommends for automation. Poor Mr. Alder. He's gonna get automated right out on his behind. Some vacation. I'll be a house guest of a man I gotta fire. Hey. Hey, Ruthie, you don't have to carry Arnold's stuff. It's okay. Yeah. Mind your own business, Willis. I like these Western women. Well, partner, we know how to treat our menfolk. Especially when they're short, dark and handsome. Willis, some got it and some don't. Well, this is it, guys. Hey, Arnold, get a load of the sign. Right. I made it myself. You guys hungry? We've got ice cream, cake, doughnuts, pie and frozen pizza. I do the shopping. I think I'm falling in love. Well, help yourselves. You know, I think it's really neat that your dad bought the radio station. What's wrong? Nothing. That nothing sure looked like something. Even when Willis says something, it means nothing. Home, sweet home. Hey, nice place. Very nice. Well, remember, Phil, I told you it wasn't exactly Buckingham Palace. We don't change the guards every few hours. But we change the sheets every few weeks. Only if we're expecting guests. It looks very comfortable. Really. I love it. It's got a kitchen right in the living room. Arnold. It's great staying with a famous radio celebrity. Well, I wouldn't say famous, exactly. Well-known, maybe. Popular. Highly thought of. One of the top 10. You may be right, Arnold. Listen, you guys are gonna have to come down tomorrow and watch my show. Hey, great! And maybe Dad'll let you say something on the air. No kidding? Can we do it tonight? Tomorrow may be too late. Arnold. Boys, you better get ready for bed. Okay. Where's the guest room? It's in Los Angeles. My mom got it. No problem. Phil, you can have the girls' room. It may be a little too feminine for you, but if you get hungry in the night, Ruthie hides the salami in her nightstand. And we can sleep out here on the floor in sleeping bags. Hey, great! Let's go put your stuff away. Yeah! Man, three in a room. Three more and it'd be just like the old days in Harlem. All right, have fun, pal. How about a beer? Sure. You know, your dad's a real nice guy, Ruthie. He sure is. Well, so is yours. You know, I think it's really neat that after all these years, the radio station brought them back together again. You did it again. Did what? You looked at each other. There's something going on. You know a secret? No, we don't. I don't care if you do. If you don't wanna tell me, I don't wanna hear it. Okay. What is it? Man, you women sure are nosey. Okay, okay, forget it. Want some candy? Yeah! Forget it. Uh-oh. She's getting tough, Willis. Maybe we better tell her. Girls can't keep secrets. She ain't like a girl. She's more like a tall, pale buddy. Okay. If we tell you the secret, you gotta take a blood brother oath not to tell. You got a sharp pin or a needle? What for? We cut our thumbs so the blood spurts out, and then we rub them together. Our tall, pale buddy just got paler. You're gonna cut my thumb, and then you're gonna cut your thumb? I kind of had Willis' thumb in mind. Can't we just dip our thumbs in ketchup and take an oath? Forget the thumbs. Raise your right hand and repeat after me. If I ever tell the secret, may a lizard eat my gizzard. If I ever... Stand up. If I ever tell the secret, may a lizard eat my gizzard. And come back for seconds. And come back for seconds. Okay. Mr. D is gonna turn your dad's station into an automat. Automate, dummy. Whichever way, your dad's gonna lose his job. Dad's gonna lose his show? Mr. Drummond wouldn't do a thing like that to my father. Would he? You remember the way we met, Lieutenant? Sure. You were hanging over the rail of a troopship being sick. I didn't know what else to do, so I ordered you to stop. Yep. I stopped, and you started. Boy. How are things going now for you, Lar? Happy? Very happy. The divorce was tough, but I have the girls with me and a whole new life up here. Phil, I love it. I just love it. Uh-huh. Lar, let me tell you about some of the problems I have with my business. See, my company is a high-leverage operation. We have to move fast. And sometimes very aggressively. But once we get the "P" and "L" in line, my board of directors is able to ascertain the viability of the projected profit factor. Phil, I have a problem with that. What's that? I don't know what the hell you're talking about. Quite simply, Lar, I came out here... Dad, could I... I'm sorry. I interrupted. No, no, no, no, no. No, that's fine, Ruthie. I wanna get settled anyway. But I do wanna get back to this subject. Where will I store my stuff, Lar? Under the banner, and straight back. What did you want, honey? Dad, what would you do if someone told you a secret, and that secret was about someone who should be told? But you swore not to tell because the someone who told you, told you not to tell. So you can't tell, but you wanna tell, even though you said that you wouldn't tell, and a lizard could eat your gizzard. Well? Honey, you could get a ticket for jaytalking. Dad. Okay, okay. Now I gather that you've got this big secret that's just burning to get loose. But, honey, if you swore never to tell that secret, then under no circumstances should you ever, ever tell that secret to anyone. It's about you. Unless it's your father. No. I better not. It'd wreck your life. Ruthie. Okay. Mr. Drummond's gonna get rid of your show. What? We should have known better, Arnold. I'm sorry, guys. But my father's my dad. Well, I certainly hope so. Dad, they're gonna automate the station. Automate? Now, now just wait a minute. Sit down, please, guys. Now look, you... You've gotten something mixed up. What'd they do, Larry? Hey, you guys been misbehaving? Yeah. We didn't wanna tell her, Mr. D. She dragged it out of us. Goodbye, gizzard. Dragged what out of you? Look, Phil, somehow the kids got the silly idea that you're gonna automate the station and throw me out of a job. Phil, where would they get that kind of an idea? Well, I've been meaning to get back to that. I'm glad you brought it up. You mean it's true? Now look, old buddy. Wait a minute. Hold the "old buddy." You're gonna automate the station with a bunch of prerecorded tapes, and dump my show, and I gotta hear about it from the little rascals? You gotta understand the way business works, Larry. It's nothing personal. Nothing personal? You're talking to the man who saved your life in the army. You never saved my life. Tokyo. Lasaya Motsamora. Oh, her. Yes. Well, back to business. Now you have to remember, I am only one of the board of directors. Yeah. He's the chairman. Larry, I am also a friend. So was Brutus before he stabbed Caesar. You got muggers in Portland, too? Larry, I am not stabbing you in the back. How would you like to be station manager? I'm not a station manager. I'm a talk show host, and I'm a darn good one. I mean, look, if your company doesn't want me, there are plenty of other places that do. Just yesterday he got an offer from Bear Claw, Montana. That's right. Thank you, Ruthie. Listen, radio stations are being automated all over the country. I know that. Just like hamburgers and fried chicken. You can go anywhere. They taste the same, look the same. No point in cluttering up the country with personal touches, old buddy. Now, wait a minute, Larry. There are two sides to being old buddies. I came out here to help you. Hey, Phil, I appreciate that. I mean, you could have sent a stranger out here to cut my head off, but you came out to do it personally. That was not kind. You know, you've really changed. You were always unreasonable, but you used to be nice about it. Well, you sure haven't changed. You're still welching on a $4 bet. Okay, okay, okay. Here's your $4. Can you change $100? You don't think I can, do you? Twenty, 40, 60, 65, 66, 67... Now, $67.14. I'll go get my piggy bank. It's got a zillion pennies in it. Never mind. I'll write you a cheque. No, you're gonna take the change. Honey, go get me your zillion pennies. Forget it. I'm going to my room. The one with the pink plastic hangers. Yeah, you go right ahead, pal. I save the wooden ones for welcomed guests. Well, I must be welcome 'cause I got a wooden pillow. Well, if you want feathers, go pluck a duck! Boy, Dad hasn't said, "Go pluck a duck" since mom told him to go milk a moose. Line 3, Lar. Hi. Time for one quick call. Who's this? This is Lyla. Larry, I just don't understand inflation. What are we going to do about the cost of food? Honey, you can do what I do. I take the family to the market, and we fill up a shopping cart. Then we zip right into the express line and eat as fast as we can, till we get down to 10 items. I gotta go, honey. Thanks for the call. I love you. I love you, too, Larry. Bye-bye. Bye. This is Larry Alder, I'll be right back after the news. Now hit this button and the newsroom takes over. You're doing great, Arnold. Thank you. Hey, would you like to be an engineer like me when you grow up? Sure. But I don't think I can grow up that much. Ruthie, your dad has a good show. Yeah. Yesterday he was a happy man. Today he's an endangered species. Our plan had better work, guys. Ruthie, you wanna take the boys into the booth? As soon as the news is over, I'm gonna introduce you guys on air. Arnold, you're not nervous, are you? No. Me? Nervous? Nah. Attaboy. Now just remember, even though you'll be talking to a half a million people, they're gonna love you. Half a million people? I gotta go to the bathroom. Hurry up. Come on, Willis. Earl, have you seen Mr. Drummond? Our lady producer is taking him around the station. Larry, she'd do anything to save this station. Right down to marrying a millionaire. And I'd be the best man. You'll find another job. That won't be too tough. I just wish old "Got bucks" would have stuck around long enough to watch the show. We do the weather from this newsroom, and, of course, the farm report is done in Studio A. You've seen my office. And wait till you see Larry's fan mail. Earl, show Mr. Drummond the fan mail. Fan mail. Fan mail. It's on the floor. By your feet, if you can find them. No. That's okay. I'm sure Larry has an audience. Anyway, thanks for showing me around, Miss Winslow. It was very nice to be with someone pleasant. You're wasting your time, Morgan. The man has a heart problem. They can't find it. You're not being fair, Larry. Mr. Drummond is a very human gentlemen. Human and warm and brilliant and charming. You have the softest eyebrows. Morgan, give up. You're no good at it. Yes, she is. Twenty seconds, Lar. Hey, where have you been? Checking the facilities. You just made it. Okay, hop up here, pal. There you go. Now, don't be nervous. All you have to do is say hello. Hello, Mrs. Garrett. Hello, Kimberly. We're not on the air yet. I'll tell you what. You get up here and watch Earl, okay? You're back on the air with Lar. And the number is 555-3567. Now before we take any calls, I wanna introduce three very special guests. My daughter, Ruthie. And two visiting VIPs from New York, Arnold and Willis Jackson. Willis, how are you enjoying Portland? I was until you and Mr. D started fighting. Yeah. Can't you be friends? Thank you, boys. Thank you. Ruthie, would you like to say a word or two, at most? Dad, Arnold and I would like to read a poem that we've written. Poem? There go the ratings. I'd like to hear it. On the other hand, it might be kind of cute. This poem is dedicated to Mr. Drummond and Mr. Alder. The dudes who are fighting. What is a friend? "If your friend is buying some soda and you don't have money to spend, "who will let you lick his glass when he is done?" "A friend." "When you come inside from the rain and you get the carpet all muddy, "who is the one that you can blame it on?" "Your buddy." "When you flunk a test in spelling and your teacher says you're dumb, "who makes you feel good by being dumber?" "Your dumb chum." "So Dad and Mr. Drummond, we hope your fighting ends "and you can be just like your kids." "Your friends!" "Your friends!" Send in for copies, $1 a piece. Diane? DIANE: Yeah, what is it? I need a bath towel. We're out of bath towels, Kim. Is a face towel okay? Sure. I'll take anything that doesn't have Arnold's little fingerprints all over it. Hi, Kimberly. Mr. Alder! Hi, Diane. Hi, Dad. What are you guys doing home? I thought you were at Janet's house. We were, but she came down with the mumps. The mumps? I just kissed you. Honey, don't ever kiss your father when somebody on this planet has come down with the mumps. Sorry, Dad. Hi, Mr. Drummond. Hi, Diane. Hi, guys. Hi. Hi. I'm going in to change. How about a beer? No, thanks. I don't drink while I'm driving. Yeah, I'll take Arnold's beer. Okay, guys. Let's finish this puzzle. Yeah, right. That was quite a poem the kids wrote, wasn't it? Yeah, it sure was. It doesn't change anything though. No. We both know that you can't use emotions when you're making important business decisions. Right. Sure is nice to see them friends again. Yeah. See, what I was trying to tell you, Larry, is that our think-tank recommended that we automate your station. Now, I couldn't reject out of hand that posture. Phil... Naturally, as chairman of the board, I have a certain fiduciary responsibility to my stockholders. Phil, could we just skip the corporate fiduciary ding-dong posture? Now look, we're friends, and we will always be friends. So you just do what you have to do to keep the business going. Okay, pal? I fully intend to. You know, Larry, sometimes in the corporate world, a rule is bent. No, wait a minute. I don't want you bending any rules for me, just 'cause the kids wrote a poem. I don't take charity. Larry, will you stop being so noble? You're being noble, I'm being logical. If you were being logical, you'd allow me to be noble, if I were inclined to be noble, which I'm not. What are they hassling about now, Ruthie? I think it's my dad's noble and your dad's logical. Or your dad's noble and my dad's... Dad, what are you? Noble or logical? Tie a can to it, Ruthie. But I thought you guys were friends again. We are friends. If you were my friend, you would listen to what I'm trying to say. I defy anybody to understand what you're trying to say, friend. If they get any friendlier, they're gonna kill each other. Tie a can to it, Arnold. Can I ask a question? When are we gonna eat? Tie a can to it, Willis. What's going on? Tie a can to it, Diane! Why don't you kids wash for dinner? How? All our cans are tied up. Dad, can I ask a question? Do you have your job or don't you? He doesn't know. He hasn't given me a chance to say. Larry, you've got the job. And it's strictly a business decision. Open your mouth and you're fired. Now, I checked the station out. I liked what I saw. I like your show, the weather report, the local news, the farm report. Good people. Good programming. And I think it should be kept on the air. It's all very nice and warm and personal. Now you show me one automated station anywhere where they let two kids read a poem while a third one hums. Hey, Phil, Phil, do you really think the station is great? Yes. And do you really think I'm good? Yes. Can I have a raise? No. You old son of a gun. Big lug. Excuse me. Mrs. Garrett. Hello, Mr. Alder. Thank you. Hi, kids! Mrs. Garrett. Hi, Mrs. Garrett. What are you doing here? I thought you were in Seattle surprising your sister. That's why I'm here. My sister's in New York surprising me. Oh, dear. Well now, children, tell me. Are you having any fun? Terrific time. ARNOLD: Yeah. Now that we're all friends again... We are all friends, aren't we, Dad? Right, Ruthie. We're all friends. That's a very important thing. Friendship. It's like I always said to the sarge, "If you're ever in a jam, here I am."
