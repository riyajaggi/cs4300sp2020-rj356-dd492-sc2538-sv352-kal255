 What's the big idea? Turn it off, come on. Sorry, guys. Oh, man, I gotta get some sleep, Mr. Drummond. I got a big ice hockey game in the morning, in the park. I'm sorry I woke you up, guys. I'll tell you what happened. I was just about to go to sleep, when I realized something. You had to go to the bathroom. No. What's going on in here? I need to get my beauty sleep. You really gonna sleep that long? I'm glad you're here, Kimberly. I was just about to tell the boys how great the old year's been for this family. You guys have been living with Kimberly and me now for exactly 56 days,

 56 of the happiest days of our lives. That's right. Same for us, Mr. D. We have everything a family could want. Except one thing. What's that? Some sleep. Good night, folks. Good night. All right. It's kind of scary, though, to realize how close I came to losing you fellas. You remember the day you came here? The very first day. Remember? I'm very good with doors. Aha! You're here. Welcome, gentlemen. You're talking to us? Of course. How about that, Willis? Downtown two minutes, and already, we're gentlemen. Come in. Come in. Mmm-mmm! This is some place. Be careful of my goldfish. His name's Abraham. I've never seen a black goldfish before. That's okay, he never saw a rich white man before, either. If Abraham looks like he's dead, don't worry. He's just sleeping. My ex-husband had the same problem. Oh, excuse me, boys. Hi, sweetheart. Hello, Daddy. Oh, they're here... Oh, look at them, Daddy, just look at them. Aren't they gorgeous? Real boys. Welcome, little brother. Welcome, big brother. What's she smoking? Boys, this hurricane that just blew in is my daughter, Kimberly. This is Arnold and this is Willis, Kimberly. Hi, there. Hi. Hi, metal mouth. Oh, Daddy, isn't this delicious? We've just met and already he's insulting me like a real brother. By the way, guys, stay out of my room or I'll punch you out. You know something, I always wanted a son. And now I've got two of them. I'm a very lucky man. Ok guys I'm going to leave you alone to unpack. Ahhhh... color TV, stereo, our own cook, Man Willis, I think we died and went to heaven. Well come off those clouds little brother. - Huh? - Don't get too use to this place. What you talking about Willis? Arnold, it aight us that died and went to heaven, It's Mama and Papa. - I'm sorry Willis. We don't belong in this place. We aight staying here. But Willis, how many kids like us get a chance like this? Don't you realise we have everything going for us now? Forget it. Come 7 o'clock tomorrow morning, you and me are going back to Harlem where we belong. Willis, there's something I want to say to you. You didn't even give yourself a chance to get to know us. The only thing I'm guilty of is trying to make you and your brother feel at home. Yeah, Mr. Drummond's Santa Claus, and you're treating him like our old landlord. Toys and money ain't family. That's right, Willis, toys and money ain't family. Family is love and caring. Maybe I overdid it, but I did it because I cared about your mother, and now, I care about you. But caring has to be a two-way proposition, and you're not even willing to meet us halfway. The worst part of it is, you're only thinking about yourself. You're not even considering your brother. You're just being selfish, Willis. Willis... Not one word out of you, Arnold. Does this count as a word? If Mama was alive, you would've got a lot worse than a raspberry. What you talking about? We're here because before Mama died, she asked Mr. Drummond to take care of us. Do you think she'd send us to live with somebody who didn't want us? I'd do what you tell me to do, Willis, but you've been a sourpuss from the minute we got here. Mr. Drummond's right. You're not being fair to me or you or him. Or Mama. Willis. I been sitting here soaking and thinking. Does that mean I can say, "Welcome aboard, Son"? Yeah. I got it right this time. Yeah, you did. This tub works pretty good? - Yeah We can all learn something from eachother. I wasn't trying or thinking of Arnold. Hey, I can't tell you how proud I am of you and how glad I am that you are staying, Willis. Yeah, but just remember, Mr. Drummond, that front door is always open any time I want to leave. That's right, Willis. Harlem is just a limousine ride away. I'm sure glad we stayed, Mr. Drummond. Yeah. And if we can get some sleep, I'll be even gladder. Okay, lights out. Oh, hi, Mrs. Garrett. Hi, Mrs. Garrett. I was going to complain about noisy tenants, but I see the landlord is one of 'em. We were just reminiscing about when the boys joined the family. That's when I joined you. Right. What a surprise. Without even a husband, I suddenly had three kids. You weren't as surprised as Grandma was when she met the boys. Right, Daddy? Oh, I will never forget that. It's so good to see you, Mother. Let's both sit down. All right. There's something I want to tell you. Oh? Yes. There has been quite a big change in my life. I have two sons now. Two sons? You... You got married and didn't invite me? No. No. I'm not married. Oh, you little devil, you! You mean it's one of those modern arrangements? No, no. Not that, either. Oh? You see, my two boys are... Yes? Well, they're... Maybe you better just see them for yourself, and make up your own mind. Arnold. Willis. You're just gonna love them, Mother. They're bright, delightful, full of fun. They're a wonderful addition to our family. Mother, these are my two boys, Willis and Arnold. What a pleasant surprise. Now, that's what I call a surprise. Now, you just relax, Grandma, we'll take care of you. Now, we know all about old ladies. We got lots of them in Harlem. Oh, you dummy. You don't remind old ladies that they're old ladies. They already know they're old ladies. Well, they called mama an old lady and she worked till the day she died. Mr. Drummond's mother never did a lick of work in her whole life. I beg to correct you, young man. I'll have you know I worked as a volunteer during the war. Is that the one the South lost? Here's you tea Mrs. Drummond, and some little butter cookies. Mrs. Garret, where did those come from? You got a new hiding place for the cookies? - Yes I found a good place besides your mouth. Will you join me in a cup of tea children? Yeah I'll have a shot. - Yeah you can shoot me too. Is this imported tea? - Oh yes Ma'am. It came all the way from the Bronx. Oooh -Now you done it stupid. No I didn't. I can't drink with one pinkie sticking out. Stay where you are Mrs. Drummond. I'll have you sponged off in a jiffy. - An $800 suit ruined. It didn't do my jocket shorts any good either. Because your own son want you to be a part of his own family. Now the choice is yours mother. - Oh well... I didn't mean to be a snob. I... I'll try to change. But it isn't easy to break old habits. You can do it. It shouldn't be so difficult for someone as loving and as kind as you are. And we'll help you. Wont we children? Sure Grandma. We all need you and love you very much. Don't we guys. - Yeah. I guess I can try. Yeah me too. I never had a white Grandma before. Yeah, you guys sure won my mother over in a hurry. Which gives me a great idea. What about writing her a letter on that typewriter she gave you? Sure. And I'll tell her how you're keeping us awake. Okay, I can take a hint. And, Willis, you can tell Grandma thanks for the terrific ski jacket she gave me. Okay. I thanked her for the French perfume she sent me. I already got results. What does that mean, Mrs. Garrett? Oh, while at the market, while I was squeezing the tomatoes, the manager was trying to squeeze me. Hey, you know what else would be a terrific idea? Write a thank you note to the Thompsons for their present. Yeah. You guys almost ended up living with them instead of us. Yeah. Hey, don't lay that one on me. Blame the engineer up there with the one-track mouth. What you talkin' about? That was one of the worst days of my life, the day that social worker came here. Mine, too. Sorry to keep you waiting, Mr. Drummond. Yeah. We would have been here sooner, but we were up there counting our blessings. Boys, there is someone here I want you to meet. This is Arnold. And this is Willis Jackson. Boys, this is Ms. Aimsly, a social worker, who's come to pay our happy home a visit. How do you do? I'm happy Willis. And I'm delirious Arnold. Charmed, I'm sure. You're Arnold. You're Willis. Yes, ma'am. We also got a happy goldfish named Abraham. And he's the only goldfish we ever saw laugh. Happy children making happy jokes. So you boys are really happy living here? If this was heaven, I'd kill myself tomorrow. Tell me why you're crying. Nevermind. Oh now come on Arnold. We've always been straight. You know, brother to brother right? Yeah. - And now that Mama and Papa have died we gatta look out for eachother. - I know. Arnold, when you hurt, I hurt. Now stop crying and tell me what's bugging you. Mr. Drummond said we belong with the black family. I heard him telling Mrs. Garrett. He said black children belong with black families. - Are you sure he said that? I heard him. My ears aren't painted on. Arnold, why would he say a think like that? You know he likes us. It doesn't make sense. - I wouldn't lie to you Willis. What I heard is what I heard. And all this time I thought there was one dude that was color blind. What are we going to do Willis? Don't worry about it. I'm your big brother and i'll take care of it. Oh, yes. Yes, of course. Willis? Arnold? Would you come down here, please? Oh, Jeffrey, look at the darling little one. This darling little one is my goldfish. I'm the darling next size up. Boys, I want you to meet Mr. and Mrs. Thompson. This is Arnold. And this is Willis. Hello, Arnold, Willis. Hi. How do you do? And they're simply marvelous boys. I'm in love with them already. Well, we're packed and ready to make tracks. Yeah, well, tell us something about yourselves. How old are you? Eight, trying for nine. I'm 13. Trying to get out of here. Well, I know we're going to make one big happy family. I'm sure. As I told you yesterday, Mr. Drummond, black children belong with black families. You said that? That's right. You said Mr. Drummond said that. He did say it. What do you want, an instant replay? Hold it, boys. What did I say? You said that black children belong with black families. I heard you say it. You boys started all this because you thought... Arnold, you little... Dummy. Thank you, Willis. Come here, Arnold. Oh, Arnold, you only overheard a part of the conversation. I was merely repeating what this rather opinionated lady here said. I am not opinionated. I was merely repeating what the computer said. You can tell your computer to go suck a lemon. Willis. Arnold, what you did was a very natural mistake. I mean, sometimes people hear a part of a conversation, and they jump to the wrong conclusion. Why, when I was only nine, I overheard my father talking, and I was sure he wanted to sell me. How much did he get for you? No, it wasn't me, it was just some stock. But I learned a very important lesson. Misunderstandings do occur. But see, when you love someone, well, then, you discuss it first before you do anything about it. Do you hear that, lame brain? Yeah, I heard. I guess there's only one thing bigger than my ears. My mouth. Mr. Drummond, will you take me and shorty here back? Willis, if you boys had left, I was thinking about leaving with you. Yeah. I know how to keep Arnold's mouth out of trouble. How about fillin' it with some hot chocolate, ice cream and cake? Thanks, Mrs. Garrett, but I'm afraid the boys have to get some sleep. They've got a hockey game tomorrow. Who, us? I just remembered, I sleep better on a full stomach. Now, he tells us. Do you remember the time Arnold couldn't sleep and kept us all awake for two whole nights? What you talkin' about, Kimberly? I'll tell you what you talkin' about. When Willis gave your doll Homer away to Kimberly's charity drive at school. Oh. Don't remind us. Hi, Willis. What's new? Isn't it about time you stopped sneakin' around? I wasn't sneakin' around. I thought I heard mice in my socks. It's about time you stopped sleepin' with that doll. Me sleepin' with a doll? What doll? Where do you see a doll? Right here. You're sleepin' with this doll. Are you accusin' me of sleepin' in that drawer? You're the only one in the family who could. Look at this ratty, old thing. You tryin' to tell me I'm dreamin' this? I'm givin' it my best shot. Kimberly is collecting old things for her charity sale at her school. Yeah. I'm counting on you guys to donate something you don't need. Will you take Willis? I have an old pair of sneakers you could have. They're so old they ran out of sneak. Come on Arnold, there must be something you want to get rid of. Yeah I'd like to give some poor deserving kid my next two years of school. Hey, Arnold, what about that beat-up doll you sleep with? Doll? Who sleeps with a doll? What doll? And who's got a doll? The one you keep in the dresser drawer. The one with the yellow hat. Nobody knows, huh? You told. I didn't open my mouth. Then your mouth has a real bad leak. It's gone. Where is it? It's not in here. It's gone! We've been robbed! Robbers! Huh? We been ripped off! Robbers! Robbers? Where? Don't touch nothin'. You'll mess up the fingerprints. They got Homer. Homer? Arnold, you little dummy. Don't "dummy" me, they're holding my doll for ransom. Boys, what's the matter here? Somebody stole my doll. Would you cool it Arnold. You know Homer aint missing. What are you talking about? Willis gave me Homer for charity. Who said you could give my doll away? Now, Arnold, this morning at breakfast, in front of everybody, you said that you were a big boy now and that you were giving Homer up. Don't you guys know when a little kid is bluffin' to save his reputation? Arnold, you're gonna end up a 35-year-old man with a wife, two kids, and a doll? You can have my wife and two kids. I just want my doll! Arnold, Arnold, this is easily solved. Kimberly... Yes, yes, I am very concerned about Arnold doctor. I know what you told me, that he would eventually fall asleep, But that was two days ago. The rest of us are falling apart, Arnold is just fine. My daughter is getting wrinkles, she is only thirteen. Yes I'll call you later doctor if we survive, If not, Arnold will call you. Goodbye. What did the doctor say? - Same as before. Not to worry, Arnold will eventually fall asleep on his own. I have this horrible feeling that he'll be collecting Social security by then. - Well I had an idea. I've hired a private detective. This kid doesn't miss a trick. Well, did you find him? Did you find him? Miles Monroe always gets his doll, kid. Well, isn't there anything you want to say to Mr. Monroe, Arnold? Yeah. This ain't my doll. What are you talking about, Arnold? This ain't Homer. Aha, it looks like Homer to me. It looks like Homer, but it ain't Homer. Oh, Arnold, how can you tell? When a guy sleeps with a doll for eight years, he gets to know. Tough luck, Drummond. Guess that's 200 clams down the old toilet. Well, thanks anyway. Stop by my office tomorrow and my secretary will have a check for you. And I'm sorry about the kid. That's the trouble with being a private eye. I get so emotionally involved with the kids. You're right, Arnold. This isn't your doll and I'm sorry that I tried to trick you. I only did it because it's impossible to find Homer again, and we're all so worried because you hadn't slept. Homer's gone forever. Listen, Arnold, I know it's hard, but sometimes in life, we have to say goodbye to things. Even things that we love a lot. That's part of growing up. But you don't have to have a doll or anything else to hold onto to feel secure, and to help you go to sleep. You're surrounded by people who love you. And that's the greatest security there is. He's asleep. He's asleep. It's good. Yeah, I'm good. If anyone wants some more, speak up. We will. You won't have to worry about me sleepin' tonight. Hey, what's this in the freezer? Oh, that's my hockey puck. You guys'll eat anything. Why did you put your hockey puck in the freezer, Willis? Well, freezing it keeps it from bouncing on the ice when you play. What keeps you from bouncing on the ice? Funny. Hey, one member of our family ain't here eating with us. Who's that? My goldfish, Abraham. I'll fix him a little doggy bag. Abraham certainly is a member of the family, all right. Who would have ever thought that a goldfish could become so involved in family affairs? Remember that little incident with Abraham, fellas? Oh, yes. Oh, yes. This ain't no justice, Abraham. Sit up, Willis. Mr. Drummond said I can't go to the skateboard contest 'cause he thinks I put Abraham in his hot tub, but I didn't do it. Ain't that a crock? Yeah, it sure is. I never wanna be eight years old again in my whole life. What's the use of being good if Mr. Drummond don't believe me? You know, that's exactly what I expected. Him with all that talk about being innocent until proven guilty is so much bull. Yeah. What am I gonna do, Willis? If I miss that skateboard contest tomorrow, the rest of my life is all downhill. Well, you're not gonna miss that skateboard contest, Arnold. I promise you. I wish I could believe you. Hey, you can. Hey, haven't I always taken care of you? Yeah, I guess so. Sure. And when you were sick, don't I get you well? And when you're unhappy, don't I let you blubber all over me? Yeah, you do, Willis, get ready for some more blubberin'. There ain't gonna be no more blubberin' 'cause I'm gonna get you off the hook with Mr. Drummond. How you gonna unhook me? You'll see. Hearing Mr. Drummond talkin' about justice. I got my own ideas about justice. Me and Mr. Drummond are gonna have ourselves one big showdown. Mr. Drummond. Yes, Willis? Remember all that jive you gave me about how everybody's innocent until proven guilty? That wasn't jive, Willis. I honestly believe that. Then how come you sentenced my brother without giving him a fair trial? Well, how much proof do you need? Abraham was doing a breaststroke in my hot tub. That don't mean I put him there. That just means my fish knows how to swim. Right. You know, Arnold's entitled to have a fair trial like it says in this book you said I should read. "A fair trial is a right guaranteed "to persons of every race, creed and color." And I gotta fit in there somewhere. Quiet in the courtroom. Mrs. Garrett, Your Honor, we're ready. Everybody, rise. Looks like she's dressed for a funeral. Yeah, mine. Would you cool it? Leave it to your mouthpiece. You may all be seated. And let's get this trial over with, because the judge has two loads of laundry in the washer. And I want to see how Daddy sends Arnold to the slammer. The prosecuting attorney will make his opening statement. Now, Kimberly, I'm not going to mention Arnold's earlier bad behavior, like snatching cookies, wrecking makeup cases, and folding legal documents into airplanes. I am not even gonna stoop to mention any of that. If he ever stoops, I'm gonna fry. Now, Kimberly, earlier today, you heard Arnold mentioning that his goldfish bowl was too small. That's right. Good. He asked for justice for his goldfish. And you brushed him off. Forget it, no more questions. Willis, your witness. That's one for our side. Kimberly, did you see Arnold put the goldfish inside the hot tub? No, I didn't. That's two for our side. In other words, you think Arnold is absolutely innocent. I wouldn't put anything past Arnold. Our side doesn't know when to shut its big mouth. Does the defense attorney have any witnesses? I'd like to call to the stand my innocent brother. Arnold, dear, will you please stand up? I am standing. Oh. Do you swear to tell the truth? I been swearin' for the last two hours, and it ain't done me no good. Proceed. Arnold, I am just going to ask you one simple question. Did you put Abraham inside of the hot tub? No, sir. I'm innocent, I'm not guilty. And get the picture? And get the picture? Your Honor, to sum up my case, everybody heard Arnold complaining about his fish bowl being too small. Next, I find his goldfish swimming in my hot tub, and finally, who is the only witness in Arnold's defense? A moth. I rest my case. Willis, while he's restin', you better get brilliant and save my butt. Has the defense attorney got anything to say on behalf of Arnold's butt? I sure do. Your Honor, look at this face. Is this the face of a criminal? No. Could this face, after givin' you his word, break his promise? Never. Your Honor, my client is innocent. Amen! Yeah. Tell him, brother. Not guilty! Set me free. Yeah. Hallelujah! Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Okay, guys, what do you say, we hit the sack? I'm wanna get up with you so I can see that hockey game. Then, I can stay home and sleep. It figures. You know, I gotta admit, I learned somethin' about fair trials from you that time, remember? Maybe you'll be a lawyer one day, Willis. Oh, he'd be a darn good one. I wanna be a doctor someday. Then you will be one. Then, I can give my brother the first brain transplant. What? Now, listen. Before you guys can be anything, you've gotta get a good education in school. Did you have to mention school while we're eating? Next, Daddy will be telling us about the good old days at his Alma Mater, Digby Prep. No, I won't be doing that, Kimberly. To my regret, the good old days at Digby Prep aren't the good old days anymore. I learned that, thanks to the boys. That was sure some hassle. What was? Oh. When you tried to get that headmaster, Mr. Bordinay, to accept Arnold and Willis into Digby. ♪ You beautiful doll ♪ You great, big beautiful doll ♪ Don't you look wonderful, Willis. But why the sunglasses? So nobody recognizes me. You know, if I went to a school looking like this in Harlem, I'd get mugged by the principal. Arnold, you look very handsome. Yes, I do. I must say, Mrs. Garrett, clothes do make the man. Oh, these outfits are too much. Hi. How do I look? Fits you like a glove. Arnold's glove. I had this outfit locked in a trunk for 30 years. Too bad it escaped. Mr. Bordinay, these are my boys. This is Willis. And this is Arnold. I trust you received their records. We ain't got any records. We ain't even been picked up for questioning. School records, Arnold. Now, why don't you two boys run upstairs and get changed into something more suitable for Digby. Oh, we'll try to change into two white boys. Good afternoon, Mr. Drummond. Oh! Are the boys home yet? Do you see the floor covered with comic books and cookie crumbs? The boys aren't home yet. Had a great time at lunch today. Ran into Stinky Rogers. Oh! With a name like that, I'd walk around him. He's an old school chum. We reminisced about the school. We even did the old school cheer. What is it? Oh, it's nothing. Do it. No, I couldn't. Okay. Well, if you want to hear it... Digby, Digby, win the game. Put the other team to shame. All around they know our name. Digby, Digby, Digby! Oh. I think I hurt myself. They should change that "Digby, Digby, Digby" to "Hernia, Hernia, Hernia." Boys, I want to talk to you. Just one second, Mr. Drummond. Lay your ears on this. Digby, Digby, win the game. Put the other team to shame. All around they know our name, Digby, Digby, Digby! Yeah! Listen, guys, I'm gonna level with you. You know those tests that they gave you? Yeah. Your scores were very low. How low? I'm afraid too low. Does that mean we can't go to Digby? Let's just face it, Arnold. We're just plain dumb. Yeah. Only you've been dumb a lot longer than me. You are not dumb. Yes, we are, Mr. Drummond. We let you down. Don't say that, Willis. Then I'll say it. We let you down, Mr. Drummond. We were trying to make you so proud of us. I am proud of you. Very proud, Willis. Does that include me? Come here. Listen, you guys. There's no way you let me down. And you're not dumb. That's just a lot of... I'm not gonna say the word. Is that the word you won't let us say? Now listen, you guys. I know that you're both very smart. I don't understand how they could have failed you. Something is wrong here. It must have been all those trick questions. What do you mean, trick questions? The kind that need answers. I mean, special answers. They wanted to know what does the blindfolded lady with the scales represent? Willis, that is the symbol of our American legal system. My answer was wrong. What did you say? I said the scales meant she was in the market. And the blindfold meant she didn't want to see the butcher rip her off. My questions were even trickier, Mr. Drummond. Oh, like what? Like they asked me how many people could sleep in a house with three bedrooms, and a double bed in each room. Yeah. And what was your answer? 18. 18? Yeah. We know people who get three in a bed, two on the floor, six on the couch, and one in the bathroom. And of course, the one in the bathtub goes crazy from the water dripping on his head. You know something, boys, for the first time I'm beginning to understand something. Me, too. We're dumb. Now, stop it, Arnold. No! Those tests are dumb. They asked you questions you couldn't possibly relate to. You want me, the headmaster of Digby, to take a test? That's right. Surely you're joking. Boys, are we joking? I don't hear anybody laughing. Me, either. The tests you gave my boys were very unfair, and we're gonna prove that to you. All right, guys. Start the questions. Question number one. If there's no water in the house, how do you take a shower? Well, obviously you can't. Wrong. You wait for them to turn on the fire hydrant, run out on the street with your underwear. That's ridiculous. You're a little out of touch, Mr. Bordinay. Willis. If I gave you a brown egg, two charlies, and a deuce of rust, what would you have? I think I'd have a headache. Wrong. You'd have $2.21. In what country? In the old country. We call it Harlem. Harlem. Really, Mr. Drummond, I think this is going a little too far. Oh? You put my boys through exactly the same experience. Question number three, Arnold. Question number three is: Name three different kinds of blues. Three kinds of blue. Well, there's azure, indigo, and baby blue. Wrong. Where we come from, the three blues are low down, barrelhouse and gut-bucket. You guys were sure right. That Mr. Bordinay was some turkey. Yeah. Yeah, and you roasted him pretty good. Listen, I've got to get some sleep. I gotta get up to go to the hockey game. Look who's talkin'. You woke us up. Okay. Okay, okay, I'm guilty. You know, I wasn't gonna let you kids stay up this late, except at the New Year's Eve party. Hey, Mr. D, at our party, can I have some champagne? Me, too, Daddy. How about me havin' a shot of the bubbly? Oh, I don't think so, Arnold. You're all too young. Am I old enough to smell the cork? That'll do it for me. One smell of the cork and my legs turn into noodles. Hey, listen, gang. Before we go to bed, let's help Mrs. Garrett with the dishes. Okay. Yeah, good idea. Well, thanks, gang. Hey, I know how we can have a lot of fun at our New Year's Eve party. How? I never dropped a water bomb by moonlight. Disregard I said that. Arnold, didn't you learn your lesson about those pranks the last time? Bombs away. See you later. Where you going? Where you ain't. I don't wanna be around when they lay the charge on you. What charge? Assault with a wet weapon. I'll get it, Mrs. Garrett. Afternoon, Mr. Drummond. Henry, you got caught in a shower. Yes, sir. And the shower came in a plastic bag. Uh-oh. Arnold, where are you? He's not in there. Who are you trying to fool? He's not in there. He's not? Arnold, where are you hiding? Come out and take your punishment like a man. Are you standing under the bed? Daddy, look here. A note. What? Hey, everybody. We found a note from Arnold. A note? PHILIP: Yeah. What did it say? It says, "Willis, please cover my goldfish at night. "He can't sleep with the lights on. I'm running away. I'll miss you all. "Even Mr. Drummond. Arnold." Arnold ran away? Why would my little brother run away? Oh, my dear. Where could he have gone? - Where could he be? Arnold! Where are you? Arnold! Mr. Drummond! Imagine seeing you here. Thank goodness you're all right. I've been out of my mind with worry about you. Well, thank God you're safe. I was never so glad to see anybody in my life. Are you really? Yes, really. Then, let's have a party. Well, it's nice to be back among my loved ones. We're gonna have a party. A party? First things first. You still have a spanking coming, because of the water bomb. You sure do know how to spoil a party. Come on, Arnold. Don't spank me. Please. I may grow up to be mean. Come here. Hold it, Mr. Drummond. You know, I agree he deserves a spanking, but you ain't the one to give it to him. Oh? What do you mean, Willis? The only one that ever spanked us was Mama and Papa. And they're dead. If anybody's got to spank Arnold, it's got to be family. And that's me. Right on. You spank me, Willis. You know, Willis, for a dummy, you're pretty smart. You sure out-foxed Mr. D. Here. Whack away on this. It'll sound just like you're beating my butt. Come here, Arnold. Wait till you hear me scream in pain. They'll think you're murdering me. Come on, Arnold, let's get it over with. Spread it on my lap. Good thinking. Just in case he peeks in, let's make it look like the real thing, huh? Huh? Hey, what you got to hit to make it sound like my butt? Your butt. What? Are you out of your cotton-picking mind? Arnold, I hope you don't ever forget that water bomb lesson you learned. Don't worry, Mr. Drummond. If my head forgets, my butt will remind it. Hey, guys, have a good hockey game. - Good night. - Good night, Kimberly. Good night, Mr. Drummond. Good night, boys. - Good night. - Good night. Thanks for your helping me clean up our party mess. Any time. Any time. Hey, guys, I really am sorry that I kept you up so late, but I just want you to know how I felt about you. We understand, Mr. Drummond. And we're glad we're livin' here, too. Yeah. You can even play with my trains. Yeah. But not until tomorrow. Okay. Good night, guys. Good night. Good night, Mr. Drummond. - Pleasant dreams. - You, too. Guess what, Willis? You got to go to the bathroom. You guessed. Go. ♪ Now the world don't move to the beat of just one drum ♪ What might be right for you may not be right for some ♪ A man is born he's a man of means ♪ Then along come two ♪ They got nothin' but their jeans ♪ But they got Diff'rent Strokes ♪ It takes Diff'rent Strokes ♪ It takes Diff'rent Strokes to move the world ♪ Yes, it does It takes Diff'rent Strokes to move the world ♪
