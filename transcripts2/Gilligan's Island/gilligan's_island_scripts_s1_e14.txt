 Hi, Skipper. Hi, Gilligan. Where do you want these plants, Professor? Oh, here, Skipper,  I'll take them. You know, Skipper,  this gets awful monotonous. Gilligan, why don't you make a game out of it? Pretend that you're taking a long bicycle ride 'from Cleveland, Ohio  to Chicago, Illinois.' - Hey, Skipper?  - What? Which way do I turn?  Left or right at Cincinnati? Will you keep pedaling? Left! You know, Skipper, these breadfruit plants are fantastic. So rich  in food value a person could live indefinitely just on breadfruit. I'd rather live  on smorgasbord. Smorgasbord? Yeah, you know, smoked  oysters, fried kippers pickled herring, finnan haddie...salted peanuts. Boy...am I thirsty? - Gilligan.  - Huh? The water won't flow  when you're not pedaling. Oh! Pump, Gilligan, pump. I am pumping. Well, so you are. I don't understand it.  The water's not coming through. - Maybe the spring dried up.  - I think you're right. The spring is our only source  of fresh water. - What happened to it?  - I don't know. Well, if something  has interfered with our water supply,  this is just the beginning. First, the plants will die, and  then the fruit-trees will die.. ...and then this can  be serious, Gilligan. - Serious?  - Very serious. Skipper, where are you?  Hey, Skip.. Don't use the water. I got some important news for.. Skipper? [chuckles]  Really, Gilligan.  Do I look like the Skipper? Well...Uh, uh! I don't know. You know,  bare feet are bare feet. - Even..  - Yes? No, you sure don't  look like the Skipper. Thanks. Hey, would  you be a darling and get me that towel  over there? Oh! You mean  this little towel? Yeah. Come on, bring it over.  I won't bite you. You promise  you won't bite me? I promise  I won't bite you. Ow! You bit me! Yeah, aren't I a tease? (Ginger)  'Hey, don't go away,  I'll be right out.' You'll be right out? 'Ready or not,  here I come.' 'I'm not ready.' Well, I was just washing  my hair, silly. - You certainly are a bachelor. - Only with girls. Don't be too shy. You know, I think  under all that mud there's a charming,  attractive man. Ginger's scarf. Lovely a girl  as I've ever seen. Here's for one of the loveliest persons on the island. Thanks, Skipper.  My first corsage. - Does that mean we're engaged? - Gilligan! What are you doing in there  with your clothes on? I've been trying to find you. I've some very important news. News? What news? Ah, oh, I don't know,  with everything happening. The mud and Ginger. My first corsage. Here, Gilligan, this will wake you up. - Hey, there's no water.  - Right! That's what the news is about.  We're out of water. Until we locate a spring  or dig a new well I suggest we start  a rationing system. A very good suggestion,  Professor. Thank you, ladies, for your  contribution to water supply. - Welcome.  - Welcome. Well, that's all the fresh water I had. Oh, my goodness,  this isn't water. It's my perfume, Mad Desire,  mixed with Flaming Passion. Great. I wonder what the men will do when they drink that. I don't know,  but I'm dying to find out. No fish, girls.  It'll make us thirsty. Okay. Water, water, water. I got to have water.  I'll go mad. Water, water. Water, please give me water. Gilligan, cut that.  Cut that out! We haven't even  started rationing yet. I know, I was just practicing for later. Here, start by emptying  these containers into our water supply. Aye-aye, sir. Professor, is it true that you're planning to ration water? That's right, Mr. Howell. We only have enough water for a few days. We may tap a spring  in a few days. I saw some shale  rock formations where we could  all dig a well. Well, count me out. When I think of well, I usually strike oil. Yeah, some people have a green thumb, Thurston has an oily one. Skipper, what happens  when we get thirsty? I mean, right now, I'd like  to have a cool glass-- Gilligan, please. Now, until we find a new spring or locate another place to dig a well, let's not use the word "water." It only makes everybody more thirsty. I'm sorry, Skipper,  but I won't mention the name of that  wet liquid again. See, I didn't say water. Now, I suggest we start  rationing the amount we drink. Exactly, Professor. Now, like I said we only have a few days left in our mm-mm supply. "Mm-mm" supply? Shhh.. So, Mr. Howell, I'm gonna put you in charge of the rationing. As usual, Thurston,  the drinks are on you. - See you at the hut, dear.  - Ta-ta, dear. Well, let's get started looking for our new spring. I have my trusted, new divining rod here. If there's anything to drink in the island, I'll find it. This rod will point out even a few drops. A divining rod? We can't afford to trust  our lives to superstition. Oh, Professor, it's not superstition. Mr. Howell, what do you think  of my divining rod? Well, I think it's divine.  No, it's utter nonsense. Hogwash, I don't believe it. Hey, look! It's pointing towards  Mr. Howell's leg. Well, I'd better go to the hut. Lovey's expecting me. Coming, dear,  be right there. Come on, Mr. Howell,  your pant's leg. Skipper, I'm still thirsty.  But, I didn't say W-A-T-- Alright, little buddy, alright. Come here, Gilligan.  I got an idea. This is a little trick  of survival I learnt from the natives  in the Solomon's. Now put these pebbles in your mouth and suck on 'em. It works. [both mumbling] Oh, please don't talk to me when I got a mouth full of pebbles. [mumbling] [coughing] What was it that was  so important that you had  to say to me? I was gonna tell not to talk with pebbles in your mouth - 'cause you might..  - Swallow them. Thanks a lot, Gilligan. Skipper, it's starting to point. - Yeah, right over there.  - No, Skipper, over here. - Over there!  - No, Skipper, over here. - Over there!  - Here. - There!  - Here. Oh, Captain! Oh, Gilligan!  Your water boy. Good heavens, it's so dry,  it's raining dirt. Water, water, Captain. Skipper! Let me do it. Oh, I see.  I'm just in time here. Mr. Howell, you're covered with dirt. Let me brush you off. - Here. - What? Don't do that, Gilligan. Your hands are dirty. Look! Not now,  Mr. Howell. Ready for our afternoon  rations already? That's exactly why I'm here. I'm your friendly water boy. Alright, Gilligan. Go ahead, now, now that's a good boy. Close your eyes, open your mouth. Okay, fill her up. - Here we are.  - Eyes closed, mouth open. - Here we go.  - Here we go. Is that all I get?  Eight drops? Eight drops? Good heavens, you got your evening rations too. Here's one for the road. Gilligan, I want you to guard  this water with your life. - You can count on me, Skipper. - I hope so. 'Cause if you don't guard  this with your life your life might not  be worth guarding. - Got a knife?  - A knife? Skipper, those people out there are my friends. Oh, I just want to mark  the water level on this stick. Alright now. That's how much  water we have now. We better have this much  when I get back. Those folks might start  getting desperate. - Desperate?  - Very desperate. Gilligan, keep  a stiff upper lip. [howling] I'm not afraid. I'm not scared. I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid. I did it. I'm not one bit afraid. [screams] Sorry, my boy. I didn't  mean to alarm you. You didn't alarm me, you just scared me. There's something  I have to tell you. If it's about the water, the answer's no. No, I've something I must  tell you in deepest confidence. You know, come over,  come over here. Come here, Gilligan.  Gilligan, come here! Okay, Mr. Howell. But when I come over here it's the same as the answer over there, no! Gilligan, my boy,  I must tell you that you are in very  serious trouble. Well, I happened  to know that someone's planning to steal  the water supply. [whistling] - Who?  - 'Who?' 'It's someone that you  know very, very well.' [whistling] 'Why are you whistling,  Mr. Howell?' [chuckles]  Bird call. ¶ Ta-di-di ¶ [whistling] Now the master  plan, you see is these two people  distract you and while your back  is turned.. Huh? ...one of them will  steal the water. Who'd do a thing like that? Please!  Shh! No names. - How many are there?  - Now, there's two. Ha-hard to tell,  you see, in a crowd. Mrs. Howell and I both knew  if this should happen that your name  would be mud. Oh, changing my name wouldn't do any good. The Skipper could still find me. He knows what I look like. - Good luck, my boy.  - Goodnight, Mr. Howell. And thanks for the warning. You sure you can't tell their names? I would never  forgive myself. I better turn in.  Goodnight. [whistling] 'Ooh! My goodness, me now!' 'Why has Gilligan left  the water bag unguarded?' 'Anybody who wanted to steal it could have stolen it by now.' Now, where in the world  could Gilligan be? - Here I am.  - Oh! My goodness, Gilligan,  where were you? I was hiding behind the bush. Lucky for you, you didn't try to steal any water. Oh, Gilligan. You silly,  suspicious boy. Why in the world would  I do a thing like that? Skipper told me that you were  on guard duty so I came over  to keep you company. Gee, thanks. Gee, Gilligan.  I don't know how you do it. I mean, hour after hour  after hour. (Ginger)  Don't you ever get sleepy? I mean, don't you ever find that your eyes are getting heavier and heavier  and wanting to close? Arms so heavy, heavy,  you can't keep 'em up. Don't you ever feel  that you're going into a deep, deep,  deep sleep? - Nope.  - Ah! Of course not.  A big, strong man like you would  never fall asleep. 'I mean a big,  strong man like you.' 'Your right eye could never  get so heavy.' 'There, hold it open.' Big, strong man like you could never, never, never fall asleep. No, I could never fall.. [snoring] 'Sleep. Asleep!' Goodbye, Gilligan. Gilligan! Advance and be recognized,  Skipper. - Right this way. - What's all the big fuss about? I'll show you. Ladies. Mrs. Howell. Gilligan, you're lucky. It's all there. Now, aren't you all ashamed of yourselves? I'm ashamed we got caught. - And you, Gilligan--  - Skipper, I-I-I don't-- Gilligan, what have you been doing all this time? I made a new  divining rod. Look. Oh, it takes a very special technique to make a divining rod. Will you stop being sore at me  if it hits water? I promise I will never ever  get sore at you again if that divining  rod hits water. - 'Well, let me see it.'  - No. The boy needs therapy. Darn clever, Professor.  Sure beats digging by hand. But we've gotta keep  our fingers crossed. Gilligan spilled every drop  of water we had left. Hi, Skipper.  Hi, Professor. I don't blame you  for not talking to me but I wanna help. Well, if you want me  to go away, just nod. I'll give you one more chance.  If you want me to go.. ...away. Fine. - Gee, I'm thirsty.  - Oh, I told you. Concentrate on your sewing. It'll take your mind off of it. That's what I did. Well,  sewing reminded me of dresses. And dresses reminded me of wool. Wool reminded me of sheep and sheep reminded me  of the mountains. The mountains reminded  me of the desert and the desert made me  thirsty again. Hi, girls. Came by  to cheer you up. I doubt if you can cheer us up. We're making a sheet to catch the morning dew. If we're lucky, we'll get  a thimbleful of water. Look on the bright side,  we might find a spring soon. If we don't,  it might rain. If it doesn't rain,  people sometimes last-- Gee, Gilligan, do you really  want to cheer us up? - Yeah, what can I do?  - Go cheer up the Howells. I can't understand it,  Thurston. All that nonsense about  a divining rod to bring water. 'Uh, yes, I know. Totally unscientific.' - Mm, are you ready?  - Yes, yes. Ha ha. Anytime you are, my dear. One, two, three. ¶ Ha-hunga-hunga-hunga-ha ¶ ¶ Hunga-hunga-hunga-ha ¶ ¶ Hunga-hunga-hunga-hunga ¶ - Ah! Rain!  - Rain! You're not listening. I don't understand it,  Thurston. It worked last year  in Yellowstone Park for the Cherokees. What's wrong, anyway? Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Howell. Now I know what's wrong. Dear folks, every time  I try to do something right everything goes wrong. Maybe everybody will be  better off without me. I make nothing  but mistakes. Even make a mistake  writing mistakes. [croaking] Hey! Hi, frog. Could you mind getting your  wet feet off my desk here? Come on. Let's go. [croaking] Wet feet? Frog? Put 'em all together,  they spell water. Okay, come on, partner.  Take me to your water. Come on, let's go. Woo-hoo! I'll follow you. Yeah! Let's go, come on. [croaking] Let's go now,  come on. Froggy, where are you?  Hey, froggy? Listen,  I don't wanna squish...you! [croaking] There you are. Skipper. Oh, Skipper,  have you seen Gilligan? Oh, Mary Ann,  if I'd seen Gilligan would I be riding  this contraption? I think he may have done something desperate. Look at the note I found. "And maybe everyone would  be better off without me." Oh, this is all my fault.  My poor, little buddy. Skipper, you don't think.. I don't know. We better  find out right away. Froggy! [croaking] [croaking] Alright, frog, I give up. There! There you are.  Come here. Come here. Hey, you alright? [croaks]  Okay? [croaks]  You alright? [croaks]  Take me to the water now. For you, it's easy.  Come on, come on. Oh! Froggy! Frog!  Where did he go? Hey, frog! Oh! What a big hole. I think  I find out where he went. I just have to hang on  and wait for help. Help! Oh, it's an underground cave.  There's lots of water. [croaks] Oh, hi. Thanks for helping me. I knew you would. Look,  there's fresh water all over. When I tell the others,  they'll be excited. But how? I can't reach the top,  and the sides are all smooth. What am I gonna do? [croaking] Thanks for your advice, but it's too bad I don't speak frog. First, we've gotta search every square foot of this island. We'll never forgive ourselves  if we don't find that boy. Oh, if we ever do find him,  well, we'll hug him and.. and squeeze him and,  and kiss him and-- Hey, what are we waiting for?  Let's go. If I yell,  somebody will hear me. Hello-o-o.. [echoes] [croaking] I wasn't talking to you. - Gilligan, my boy.  - Gilligan! - Gilligan!  - Gilligan! - Oh, Gilligan!  - Gilligan! - Gilligan!  - Gilligan! Gilligan, little buddy.  Gilligan! My little buddy's hat. Gilligan! Couldn't...be in the hole.  No, he wouldn't have. Gilligan? Gilligan,  are you down there? - Hey, Skipper.  - Gilligan! [screaming]  Gilliga-a-an.. Welcome. Gilligan, little buddy.  Is that you? Yes, Skipper. What are you doing down here? - I brought you your hat.  - Oh, thanks, Skipper. I'm glad to see you, even if I can't. Well, think how happy I am. Yeah, look. Fresh water, Skipper. I don't mean about the water, little buddy. I mean about you. I don't mind telling you  I've got a lump in my throat. Well, be careful. Don't swallow. It might be my frog. - Gilligan! Gilligan!  - Gilligan! Oh, Thurston, we simply have got to find that boy. I know what I'll do. Offer  a reward. $5,000 or $10,000. Thurston, there are times when money is absolutely useless. Ooh! What you said, Lovey. I see a tunnel there. Maybe we can get out. We can't see where we're going.  We need light. I got some matches, Skipper. Oh, Gilligan, so have I but we fell in the water.  The matches are wet. Why don't we build a fire? Dry 'em out? You can't light a fire  and dry out the matches when you need dry matches  to light a fire. No wonder you are the Skipper and I'm only the crew. - Gilligan! Gilligan!  - Gilligan! Let's search that area over there. I once had a part in a jungle  movie where everybody got lost. - Everybody?  - Yes. And nobody ever found them. The hero died, the heroine died. They all died. But that picture had  a happy ending. How could it have a happy ending? Made three million dollars. - Let's go.  - Gilligan! - Gilligan, my boy? Gilligan!  - Gilligan! Oh! (Mr. Howell)  'I wonder where that boy  has gone to.' Hello-o-o.. Thurston, that was  Gilligan's voice. Can anyone hear us? And that's the Skipper's voice. Thurston, I think they're  down that hole. Heavens to Sherlock Holmes, we found them. Gilligan, Skipper, we're here, we're here. That's wonderfu-u-ul.. It's dark down here. Can you give us some light? Oh, it's dark. Yes, I can imagine. H-here, here's some matches. Nice catch, little buddy. Careful now. No, no, hit it on the.. ...the other side. The side  of the box, eh. Oh, Gilligan.  I know you can do it. On the side  of the box, little boy. Mr. Howell, have you found them? They're down there.  Just threw them some matches. - Matches?  - Yes. Why, there may be explosive gasses down there. Gilligan! - Don't light that!  - Gilligan. Get back, everybody. Get back. - Skipper?  - Gilligan? How are we gonna get 'em up from there? Never mind that. How're you gonna get us down from here? [indistinct chatter] Hold it down now, folks. I think we should have  a few words from the man of the hour,  Gilligan. [whistling and clapping] Thank you.  It just goes to show what I can do  when I concentrate. And you did this one  all by yourself, Gilligan. Yes, sir. And I know  how to locate water now without help from anyone. Uh! Well, you gotta give credit  where credit is due. - Ole.  - Ole. Here's to Froggy. [croaks] ¶ Now this is the tale  of the castaways ¶ ¶ They're here  for a long, long time ¶ ¶ They'll have to make  the best of things ¶ ¶ It's an uphill climb ¶ ¶ The first mate  and his skipper too ¶ ¶ Will do their very best ¶ ¶ To make  the others comfortable ¶ ¶ In the tropic island nest ¶ ¶ No phone, no lights,  no motor cars ¶ ¶ Not a single luxury ¶ ¶ Like Robinson Crusoe ¶ ¶ It's primitive as can be ¶ ¶ So join us here  each week my friends ¶ ¶ You're sure to get a smile ¶ ¶ For seven stranded castaways ¶ ¶ Here on Gilligan's isle ¶
