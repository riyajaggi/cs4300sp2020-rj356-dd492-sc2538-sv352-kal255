 - May I have the guava jelly?  - We got to have some privacy. - Where is the guava jelly? - You haven't heard a word said. Sure I did. You want  more privacy. Now, may I have  the guava jelly? No, you can't. We're not gonna serve you  anything else either. If you don't cooperate with us, we won't cooperate with you. Here's the guava jelly, Skipper. - Oh, no, you don't.  - Oh, yes, I do. - Oh, no, you don't.  - Oh, yes, I do. Yes, you did.  Thanks a lot, Gilligan. By the way, we're not gonna  do anymore washing either. Besides, you said you'd build us a hut last week. We've had other things  that are more important. We'll get to it soon. Oh, well, there won't be any lunch today. We have other things to do that are more important. We'll get to it  as soon as we can. Oh, I'm...sorry that we're-we're late for breakfast. We're used to having breakfast  in bed served by our butler. That's after his butler serves him breakfast. Ha ha! That's the only way to live. Here you are, Lovey. Oh, dear, isn't there  anything left? I'm sorry, Mrs. Howell, but Mary Ann and Ginger are on strike. On strike? By George, you get two workers together they organize every time. You men keep promising  to build us a hut. And you won't keep  your promises. Women should have the same rights as men. Ha ha. Did you hear that, Lovey? Women should have the same rights as men. [laughing] You're not laughing, Lovey, with these.. Thurston, you've been  promising me to build a hut of our own for weeks now. I'll get to it by and by. But I'm not asking  for anything elaborate. Just a little split-level hut  or a palm tree penthouse. I'm afraid, you women will  have to face the facts. Historically, it's the man who decides what should be done. - Yeah.  - Hear, hear, hear! Haven't you ever heard  of Lysistrata? Yeah. Isn't that a mouthwash? Lysistrata was a woman who lived thousands of years ago. And she persuaded all the women  in her town to ignore the men completely unless  they got what they wanted. Well, I think we should  all act like Lysis-Lysis.. - Lysistrata, dear.  - Lysistrata. That's Greek to me. Hey, Confucius say, "Women who stand on rights sometimes get laughed." [laughing] Ha ha. Come on, girls. We'll build our own hut. I sure wish you girls  weren't doing this. - Did you hear a voice?  - No, I didn't hear a soul. Please, man,  I'd rather do it myself. But it's very heavy.  You might strain yourself. These men must learn,  we can take care of ourselves. I took care of myself in a farm in Kansas and that's tough. And I took care of myself in Hollywood and that is tougher. Ah, ho ho! Wait a minute, wait a minute. - Ow!  - Mrs. Howell, are you coming? In a minute, girls! Lovey, w-we've been married  for 19 wonderful years. And during all that time  I've taken care of you. I've watched over you.  I-I've babied you. No, no. Look, look, please. You'll be lost without me.  Lost, I tell you. Ready, girls! Lovey darling, just tell me  one thing. One last thing. What color pill do I take  at noon, please, love? Oh, the redsies. No, you must let me.  You can't do this. Lovey, you're doing a mad, impulsive thing. I mean, really. You can't carry those heavy bags like that. I.. Thank you, girls. Now, ladies, please, I wish you'd reconsider this whole thing for your own safety. Yes, there might be  wild animals on the island. - Or wild natives.  - Or wild life. They're just trying to scare us. And we're not going  to be scared. I haven't heard a thing. As far as I'm concerned,  we're all alone on the island. Just the three of us. Besides, we have everything. We have blankets, clothes, pots. What about tools? Er, by the way,  have we got any tools? - Tools?  - Er, here. - I'll take this.  - Good. I bet they'll be back  before dark. I-in tears. An hour without me, she'll break. She's utterly dependent upon me. Really? Yeah. Besides, I have the credit card. [laughing] [Skipper whistling] [humming] Ha, Lovey! Ha ha. This is the perfect place to build our hut. Can we rest a little longer? No, we have to have a roof  by night fall. We'll lay the first stake right there. - Come on. Bring the hammer.  - Oh, it's heavy. - I guess I better help.  - Alright, now, come on. - Alright.  - Ready? - Aim!  - Ah! - Swing!  - Oh! Drive it in a little further. - Ready?  - Ready? - Up!  - Aim! - Swing!  - Ah! Can we rest now? We gotta have this  hut done by night fall. Now, I guarantee those men will come crawling on their knees to get us back. They need us. Hi, little buddy.  What's cookin'? Fish stew. Try it, Skipper. Doesn't smell like fish stew.  What's in it? Pineapples, coconuts, and wild berries. Well, what kind  of fish, Gilligan? Fish. Oh, yeah. I knew I forgot something. Oh, what have we here, Gilligan? - Fish stew.  - It looks like low tide. Let's have a little taste. Oh, poor Lovey. I don't know how she's gonna manage without me. She must be lying somewhere on the beach curled up and sobbing. - 'Hm.'  - It's awful. - It'll teach her a lesson.  - No, no, I mean the stew. It needs something, boy. It does need something. - Fish.  - Oh, good. Never mind. Mr. Howell, if it's no good,  how can I fix it? You really wanna know?  You really wanna know? - I really wanna know.  - Start over. Hah! Start over. We appreciate your help,  Mr. Howell. Oh, oh. Yes, yes. I'm sorry. I do miss the woman's help, you know? This cleaning and sweeping is-is so exhausting. Maybe it wouldn't be exhausting  if you did a little work. Well, I-I'm working, it's not physical work but mental work which is even more difficult. That's right.  Especially for me. I have a plan which might bring them back. They are afraid of the night and wild animals, right? Who isn't? Mr. Howell, there are no wild  animals on this island. No wild animals, yet. Now, I have a plan. See, according to the Howell plan.. Swing! [screaming] We should've taken  the smaller hammer. They knew it all along. That's  why they gave us this one. - We can't go and get it now.  - Why not? Well, because they want us to fail. They won't give it to us. I think they will. I don't know why, but men  always do anything for me. I know why, darling.  Go and get it. Oh, that's-that's fine.  That-that's fine. It's coming along fine. I still think I should be the head. Gilligan, you are the tail. I'm  the head because I'm the brain. Maybe we need a dragon  with two tails. - 'I can't wait until dark.'  - 'Yeah, yeah.' (Skipper)  'Wait till we get there. We'll  scare the dickens off 'em.' They'll be asking us to save  them from the monster. (Thurston)  'It's good to have  a little rehearsal.' Okay, now. Let's go  together, gentlemen. Howl! [roaring] Cut! Cut! Cut! No, no. Stop, stop, stop. You've gotta make both ends sound the same. See what I mean? Alright, now, the front end,  let's hear it. [Skipper roars] Alright, the rear end,  let's hear it. [Gilligan roars] Alright, now, all together! [both roaring] Good heavens, I think we've found an answer to The Beatles. Well, we certainly know  how to handle them, don't we? I think our plan's better than their plan. Can't wait till that  monster comes here. Come on. Gilligan, watch  where you're going. I'm sorry, but if you stop that  fast I'll be in front of you. I can't put my hand out. So, be more alert. - Let's give 'em a little roar. - Yeah. - A little roar. Softly.  - Yeah. On you mark. Get set. Go. [loud roaring] Gilligan.  Gilligan! I said softly. Oh, sorry, Skipper. Okay. On your mark.  Get set. Go. [roaring] Listen to the lovely sounds  of a tropical evening. Skipper, they think  we're crickets. - Let's give them a real show.  - Yeah. [roaring] Skipper, let's hurry, huh?  I'm suffocating back here. Alright. Let's get over a little closer. When they come out and see us, they'll really run home. Did you see something move out there? [roaring] Something m-m-move? There's nothing there.  Now, don't be scared. [roaring] - Oh, look at that!  - Oh, it's a monster! Oh, we must protect ourselves. Oh, but how? Look at that wild beast! (Ginger)  'Oh, it's just awful.' We must fight it off. We must let the men know  that we're big and strong. And should have equal rights. - But what can we do?  - We'll kill it. And send its head  back to the men. - Did you hear that?  - Of course, I heard that. I'm the part with the ears. - They want to kill us.  - They gotta catch us first. - Yeah.  - Come on. [roaring continues] - 'Skipper!'  - 'Gilligan!' You tried to frighten us  to get us back, didn't you? No, that's not  it at all, ladies. There's a better  explanation than that. - Yeah, that's right. - Er, well. Tell 'em, Gilligan. Don't just sit there.  Tell 'em. Huh? Oh, yeah. We were on our way to a masquerade party. And we're going right by the hut.. No, no. We were gonna celebrate the Chinese new year with this great dragon, because next week it's the.. Well, to tell you the truth. I-I'm open for, uh, suggestions. You know, without the women washing clothes is kinda fun. - That's right, Gilligan.  - And cleaning up the hut. - That's kind of enjoyable.  - Right again, little buddy. And prepare meals, that's kind of pleasant. - Exactly.  - That was a fun game. What do we play next? A game called, "Back to scrubbing the clothes." Gilligan, help me  thread this needle. Oh, sure, Professor. By the way, thanks  for doing my laundry. - That's okay.  - I missed it again. You've got to wet the thread.  Let me show you. - Let me do it, Skipper.  - Never mind, Gilligan. - Here, I almost got it through. - You got it through my finger! Sorry, Skipper. At times like these a woman  comes in handy. It's hard to believe  they've only gone two days. Seems more like two years. Believe me, we've thought  'em a lesson. There you are. - Thanks, Skipper.  - Boy, I sure need this. - Gilligan.  - It's no use, Skipper. Either we get stronger clothes  or softer rocks. You get back to scrubbing  those clothes. But take it easy this time.  Our clothes won't last forever. Excuse me, gentlemen. Did you  want your dinner well done? - Well, it's fine, Mr. Howell.  - I mean, very well done? - It's okay with me.  - Very, very well done? We don't care how well done, Mr. Howell. - Oh, good. - What are we having for dinner? - Ashes. - You said you were a good cook. Well, I am, when I have  a chef working for me. I'll be glad when women learn their lesson. With them here, we had meals, clothes, things were easier. We're trying to prove a point. They can't get along without us. But we can get along  without the women. Yes! And don't you forget it. By the way, did you  happen to notice what color pill Mrs. Howell  gives me before din-din? This is the fourth nail I've broken today. Since I got here,  I broke eleven. - Eleven?  - I broke one twice. Ginger, we're proving  a principle. Right. We can get along without the men. It's just the men who can't get along without us. - I hope so. - There's no question about it. Let's not give  the men another thought. I sure do miss the women. Oh, Gilligan, let's not mention the word women. Right. They've caused us  enough trouble. - I sure do miss the ladies.  - Gilligan. - Girls?  - Gilligan! I miss the boys  with long hair. Just go to sleep. Well, here we are.  It's beddy-bye time. You're more dressed up to go to bed than I am to be awake. You're so right.  Nighty-night, everyone. Goodnight, Lovey.  Wherever you are. Women. I'll go along with that. How about you, Gilligan? I don't know that much  about women. Neither do I. But I've been  married to one for 22 years. Oh, if women would just act the way we wanted 'em to. You can say that again. If women would just act  the way we wanted 'em to. [Arabian music] [music continues] Come here, my wives. What is your pleasure,  mighty potentate? I have an itch. Where? It is pleasant  wherever you scratch. Do you like that, Mr. Howell? Oh, I wish I were scalp all over. That is marvelous. Give those a high gloss, will you, my dear? I'd love to. Oh, crazy girl, crazy. Comfy, dear? Yes. You don't mind  the two lovely girls, do you? Of course not, darling.  Anything to make you happy. Oh! Those bubbles tickle.  Must be vintage 1947. Oh! Hello, tickle  the little darling. Easy, girls. Easy. [all cheering] [screaming] Wait a minute.  Take it easy, girls. There's enough of me  for everybody. Every time I see you,  I get chills! - I get goose bumps.  - Oh, I feel so weak. Dear me, I don't know  if I'm an actor or a virus. Oh, you send chills through me. We have pictures all over  the wall and ceiling. - Even on the floor.  - Yeah, yeah! Wall to wall. We take off our shoes and we  walk barefoot through you. [screaming] [screaming] Ole! Ole. Ole! [Spanish music] [applause] You are the most heroic  bullfighter in all of Spain. - Si, si. I suppose I am.  - I have a present for you. A new sword. Now the little bulls will have a chance. Senor Gilligan, here is my present. Si, si. I no can see see. Darling, look what I have  brought you. Mejican beauties. Ah! I've been gored by a rose. - Oh, let me kiss it.  - Let me. No, no, no.  Let me kiss it. Ya, ya. [bellowing] Ole. Ole. Ole. Ole. Ole! Gillian, wake up,  little buddy. Oh, you are beautiful,  Senorita. I.. Oh, hi, Skipper. - You've been dreaming.  - Huh? Only been in bed a half an hour. I guess none of us can sleep. Yeah, we might as well get  dressed. Go outside and sit. [chuckling] [guitar music] Ole. I think we've been getting along fine without the women. - Right, Mr. Howell?  - Oh, yes, yes. I've even solved  my pill problem. I take one  of each kind every hour so I won't miss any of them  and I feel good. I rattle when I walk though. You just wait and see. Those  women will be back pretty soon. - How long they've been gone?  - Sixty one hours. Forty two minutes. Eleven seconds. To tell the truth, I'm kinda  missing the ladies myself. But there must be some way  to solve this problem. I thought of a way.  It's a real simple idea. All have to do one thing. - What?  - Give up. Tell 'em they were right, we are wrong, and ask 'em to come back. - Never.  - Absolutely not. I'd rather die. (Thurston)  'On the other hand, there's  no point being stubborn.' 'I miss my Lovey.' Which one of us  will weaken first? Since I'm the only married man,  I think I should approach the quarters first. It'll be  the least embarrassing. - That's right, Mr. Howell. - You just wait right here now. [insects chirping] [whistling] [whistling] I can't understand it.  That's our family whistle. Been in the family for years. [whistling] Lovey, dear? Ha ha.  They must be asleep. Uh, Lovey, dear? Lovey, dear? The idea! - Sneaking around like that.  - Peeping toms. - Peeping tom..  - I can't believe.. Oh, the nerve of them. Well, maybe they didn't  know it was you. I bet they didn't. Well, who else around here  calls my wife, Lovey? - Howell, just cool off.  - Cool off! I'm drenched. They must be up to something. Oh, look! (Lovey)  'They made another monster!' They can't think  we'd be foolish enough to fall for another monster. (Mary Ann)  'This one's even bigger  than the last.' (Ginger)  'I think it's cute.' Oh, it just shows how silly  they are. Men, I mean. It's ridiculous. It must take four of them to operate it. I don't believe it. [giggling] [indistinct chattering] [screaming] Thurston, thank heavens,  you've come to save us. Oh, Thurston. What's going on here? - There, look!  - Look! Gilligan, we'll get a closer look. I can see it fine from here. Professor, you're in charge.  We'll be right back. - O-oh, oh!  - Gilligan. - Sure is weird looking. - Skipper, let's get outta here. We can't. One of us  gotta keep an eye on it. What's the other one have to do? Go back and report  to the others. - I volunteer on that.  - You'll do as I say. - Aye, aye, sir.  - Keep an eye on it. - Don't let it get away.  - Which eye? Don't know what I'd do without you. - Where's Gilligan?  - Gilligan's been eaten. Gilligan is fine. Oh, you stupid monster.  I'll save us. Wait, Skipper. That monster suddenly  looks very familiar. Familiar? (Professor)  'It's a lost weather balloon.' It's our rescue. We can inflate it and send it up with messages. They always have radio  equipment. We're saved. [all cheering] Ready or not, here I come. [bang] [whooshing] Hot wind! He's trying to breathe  fire on me. If St. George can do it,  Gilligan can. No brains! I did it. I did it. I killed it. I killed it. A-ah. That's the brains. USAF? United States Air Force, balloon. Oh! [clattering] Gilligan certainly did  a thorough job on this radio. It's absolutely useless. You know, Skipper, I've been thinking. We still got a chance with that balloon. What do you mean Professor? I can sew up the rips. I can use some tree sap to seal it. And hot air from the fire to inflate it. It'd make a great rescue signal. Exactly, a plane or a ship will spot it. Hi, Skipper. Hi, Professor. - Hi.  - Hi, Gilligan. - What have you got, Gilligan?  - It's a big secret. I've been working on it  for days. Look, material. For skirts, for dresses,  for the hut, huh. And where did you  get that, Gilligan? From the balloon.  I cut up little pieces.
