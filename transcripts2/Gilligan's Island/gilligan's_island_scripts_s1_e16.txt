 [peppy music] (Skipper)  'Gilligan!' 'Gilligan,  where are you?' Gilligan.  Gilligan! What are you doing down here? You're supposed to be cutting bamboo poles. I'm digging a barbeque pit for  Mr. Howell. Goodbye, Skipper. - Goodbye, Skipper?  - I gotta dig this pit. - So long. See you later.  - Well, dig. Oh, Gilligan, let me show you how to dig a barbeque pit. [Gilligan gasping] You broke the shovel,  Skipper. Where is the rest of this shovel? Gilligan, that's the fifth shovel you've broken this week. Sorry, Skipper, but I hit  something real hard. The only thing hard on this island is your head. Soft...sand. See, I told you, must be  a rock or something. Don't feel like a rock, it feels square, Gilligan. - A big square rock?  - Yeah. Gilligan...give me the rest of that shovel. I think you've uncovered.. Look at the chains. Dig! Gilligan, I think you've uncovered a treasure chest. Careful. I gotta make  a turn here. Yes, Gilligan, I see that  we have to make a turn. - Give me that one.  - Another roller down. - That's right, Gilligan.  - Come on, push. If we work as a team,  it'll see us through. Yes, but you're not pushing hard enough. Come on. Come on, Skipper. Push, push, push. Gilligan, I thought  we could do this together. But since you're gonna  stand there and criticize I'll do it myself. Oh, never mind that. Look at this chest,  Gilligan. It must be hand forged.  Even the lock and the chain. Forged. You mean it's an imitation? This is the real thing. There must be a fortune in this chest. Let's try and get  this padlock unchained. Hand me that  piece of bamboo. Here. I can hardly wait to see what's inside that treasure chest. Treasure chest!  What's in it? Oh, is it real? - Who found it? - Why don't you try to open it? - Who buried it?  - Can we help? Ginger, we don't know,  maybe pirates. Mary Ann, I did,  we're trying, and no, thanks. It's the most exciting thing  that's happened to us. We always read about it, but never expect to find any. Let's get some leverage on. One, two, three, go. [screaming] - Sorry, Skipper.  - Ow, my pinkie. Please, everybody,  stand back. I don't want anybody to be hurt  when this chain snaps. Ah-h...the gold. Think the rust would've weakened the chain after all this time. I hope we can saw the chain,  with the piece of coral. We'll find out when the girls get back. - Well, what have we here?  - Hi, Mr. Howell. Treasure chest, got it when I  was digging the barbeque pit. Lovey, that's how millionaire's used to keep their money. Great, but it doesn't look as though it could hold very much. Our piggy banks are bigger than that. Have you tried to open it? Skipper! Skipper,  maybe this'll work. I got it off the fish we had last night. Hold the chain. Ready? Watch it. Cut it right. Gilligan, I could've told you,  that wouldn't work. You've gotta use your head.  That's why I'm using the coral. - Does that work?  - No. I wish the Professor were here. He could tell us how to open it. He's on the other side, searching in caves. He'll be back tomorrow. That chest's been closed  for hundreds of years. One day wouldn't make  any difference. I suggest we have  a goodnight sleep and try first thing  in the morning. Gee, thanks for putting up my hair, Ginger. I couldn't sleep anyway thinking about that treasure chest. I hope it's filled with diamonds or gold or even silver. What would you like to find in it? Rock Hudson. - 'Gilligan?'  - Yeah. Shhh! Are you asleep? If I am, I'm doing it with my eyes open. Too excited to sleep. You have every right  to be excited. Just think. By this time tomorrow,  you might be a millionaire. What will you do  with all that money? Firstly, I'm gonna buy something, open that chest. You really think I'm a millionaire? Sure, it's your chest,  you found it, didn't you? Yeah. Well, finders, keepers. What do you think is in there? Silver and gold doubloons.  Maybe even gold bullion. - Soup?  - No, Gilligan, not soup. Whatever it's got, it's got a lot of it. Oh, I just wonder what's in there. I can hardly  stand the suspense. Come to bed, Thurston, it's getting late. I can't sleep.  I just keep wondering. What wonderful, marvelous  trinkets must be in that chest? Thurston, in all the years  we've been married I never saw you  pace the floor before. Well, of course not. At home,  I had my butler do it for me. These islands  can be so inconvenient. Are you positive that treasure chest belongs to you? Of course, Gilligan was  working for me at the time when he was digging  and found it. He was in my employee. All  big business operates that way. Just wish we could  open that chest. But how? The captain and Gilligan did everything they could. They tried everything but picking the lock. Picking the lock, Lovey. Like  on the "Late Late Late Show." Why don't we try that? I'll get my knitting needle. Gilligan, I just thought of something. We didn't think about picking the lock. Yeah. Bobby pin. I was once in a movie where I  picked a lock with a bobby pin. Ginger. Oh, dear. Quiet, Lovey. Thurston, this is fun. I feel positively criminal. Skipper, Skipper, I can hardly wait to find out if I'm a gold millionaire or Julian millionaire. [gasping] - Good evening.  - A good evening, yes it is. A beautiful evening. We're just out for a breath of fresh air. No, Skipper,  remember we came here to-- Gilligan, you know...night air  is bad for my little buddy. Shall we, uh, turn in... for the night? - Right. Goodnight, ladies.  - See you all in the morning. Atta boy, Skipper.  I knew you'd get it open. Certainly. Let the weight of the chest itself break it wide open. Make it fast. I still don't see, how you're gonna open the chest, this way. Very simple, Mr. Howell. All  we have to do is cut the vine. The chest falls,  and it's own weight will break those seams wide open when it hits the ground. I must say that's very clever. I must reward you with, uh, part of my treasure chest. Your treasure chest? That treasure is Gilligan's. Gilligan's? Of course, he found it.  Didn't you? You were with me,  don't you remember? Of course, I remember. But he was working for me. Therefore, the treasure is mine. Finders, keepers. But that's ridiculous. It's the practice of any corporation. - Gilligan is not a corporation. - I'm not even a business. I still say  the treasure chest is mine. - Treasure chest is Gilligan's. - It's mine. - Gilligan's.  - Mine. - Gilligan?  - Mine. - It's only me.  - I thought it was Mr. Howell. I came back to help you  protect your rights. When Howell wants something,  he can be pretty tricky. There you are. I thought I might find you next to my treasure. Gilligan's treasure. Gentlemen, I'm sure there's  some simple and fair solution. And what did  you have in mind? Nothing specific, perhaps tossing a coin. Drawing straws. Oh, what about a game of cards? Gentlemen settle differences with a game of cards. Now, Lovey, you know that I know nothing about cards. - Did I do it right?  - You did it perfectly. - I'm a champion poker player.  - I know. He fell right  into our trap. I was the best poker player in the whole of the seven fleet. We gotta make sure  that he plays poker. I think we can be coaxed  into a little game of cards. - Where are you gonna get cards? - Oh, cards? By a happy coincidence, I just happen to have a deck of cards. - One game, winner take all?  - Yes, agreed. - Shall we play Gin Rummy?  - Blackjack. - Casino. Red Dog.  - Baccarat. Whist. Well, anything but poker.  That's my worst game. - Mine too, but we'll play.  - Agreed. You'll have to excuse me for not knowing too much about cards. - I'll cut.  - Not yet. (Thurston) 'See, back home, I pay attention to more important things.' 'Such as...polo playing.' 'Fox hunting.' But then of course, from time to time I did watch the boys play. Now...how many do I deal? Why six, I think. Five, isn't it? He's right. I think you deal five. Alright,  whatever you say. Now, you may cut. Now, you may deal. Ready? (Professor)  'Hey, the girls told me  the fantastic news.' That's the treasure chest? (Gilligan)  'That's right, Professor.' 'It certainly looks like  the real thing.' I understand, there is  a question to the ownership. That's why we're playing one game of poker, winner take all. Back home we'd never play cards for anything so important. But back home, there are laws  about such things. This fellow was in my employee. Well, the law says  finders, keepers. If you're interested in law,  only one way to settle it. - A court trial.  - A court trial here? Why not? As the law says "Lex Loci Lex Scripta Lexi Ta Ra 'Nemo Solos Ab oath.'" - What does that mean?  - Your case comes up Tuesday. You both agree to a trial  to establish the ownership. Right, Mr. Howell? - Of course. I have legal right. - Gilligan? Skipper says I'm not allowed to  talk to anyone except attorney. - Well, who's your attorney?  - Skipper. I'll pay you a thousand dollars to represent me. - But he's gonna be the judge.  - I'll double the offer. Public official, Mr. Howell. No more of you evasive replies. Just answer yes or no. Did I or did I not hire you  to dig the barbeque pit which resulted in your finding the treasure chest? Thurston, that's very good.  You're bound to win. Lovey, you see, this is an open and shut case. While I did hire Gilligan, I didn't actually pay him. And the Skipper might use that as a loop hole. Loop hole! Oh, you know  all the legal terms. Why not? After all I watched Perry Mason for six years. But I can close that loop hole, if.. If what, dear? If I can get Gilligan to take the money now. Oh, there you are, I've been  looking all over for you. Oh, you have?  I've been right up here. Yes, I wanna pay you for the work that you did for me. But I never finished digging  the pit, I dug for 10 minutes. At least let me pay for the time that you dug. One hundred dollars be enough? A hundred dollars? That's almost five hundred dollars an hour. Six hundred, but who's counting. Gilligan, don't take that money. Why not, Skipper? Gilligan, he's hoping that  you'll take the money because it'll strengthen his claim on the treasure chest. From now on, Mr. Howell, you are not to talk to my client. Alright. I'll see you in court. Ah. O-oh. O-oh. Hi, Gilligan. Oh, hi, Ginger. I'm just ironing my shirt. My lawyer said I gotta look the best for the trial. - You're cute.  - Ow. - Skipper's not here.  - I didn't come to see him. Well, the Professor's not here either. - I came to see you.  - Oh, yeah? Ever since I've been  on this Island I've been forcing myself  to stay away from you. Just to fool the Skipper  and the Professor. You fooled me pretty good too. Look at me, Gilligan. Can't you tell what I've got  bottled up inside of me? No, but it's sure trying to get out. Let me tell you how-- O-oh, you're hot. Just my buttons. Would you  do me a favor? (Ginger)  'Forget about that old chest.' 'I mean, just admit that you  were working for Mr. Howell.' - Okay?  - Yeah and.. And? You can stay away  from Gilligan. Ginger, you can go back to Mr. Howell and tell him that it didn't work. That's right, Gilligan. It's not only important  to tell the truth but it's also important  how you tell it. Let's get the story straight,  right from the beginning. Okay, you told me to cut some bamboo for a fish trap. Mr. Howell said he had a job-- Hold it.  Did he say "job?" No. Then don't mention it. Now, remember  the five points. If you're struck  at the trial, look over to me. I'll give you an answer  by holding up a finger. Now, let's try. Mr. Howell wants you  to do something for him. Shows you where he wanted  the barbeque pit. 'He never mentioned  the word "job."' Never talked about money.  And never paid you a penny. - Now, you got that?  - Yeah. - What's that?  - Your thumb. No, it's Mr. Howell, asking  you to do something for him. Oh, I see.  That's pretty good, Skipper. What's that? Mr. Howell never paid me  a single pinkie...penny. Right, Gilligan.  Remember that. (Gilligan)  'Don't worry, Skipper,  I'll remember.' (Skipper)  'You'll remember, even if we  have to sit up all night.' Tampering with the witness. I'll file charges. Now, Mr. Howell,  take it easy. Tell me again,  what were his exact words? Gilligan said  that he'd get it straight. Skipper said he'd make sure,  but took all night. So, I want to prepare charges  in court. Counsel has the right to go over testimony with his client. - Whose side are you on?  - I'm not on anybody's side. Oh, you're not.  I'll take care of that. All over again. Hey, I wonder what's going on over there. I hope you're not thinking of offering me a bribe. Of course not. You recall  two weeks ago at dinner when I asked someone to pass me  the juice and you did. Well, I want  to pay you for that. - Five thousand dollars?  - No, no, no. I caught you red handed. Trying to bribe a public official. Your Honor, I want to file charges. First trial hasn't even started and I've already got  two more cases on the docket. Are you ready? Everyone take their places. The first superior court of this island is now in session. (Skipper)  'The Honorable Professor  presiding.' Be seated. Since everyone is familiar with the case, we will dispense with the reading of the  complaint encounter charges. Skipper, you may call  your first witness. - 'I object.'  - To what? I want to call  my witnesses first. But Mr. Howell-- 'You don't let me, I'm gonna  take back my cape.' Professor, that is Your Honor. It's perfectly alright  with me if Mr. Howell calls  his witnesses first. Alright, Mr. Howell. You may call your first witness. Thank you. I call as my first witness,  a Mrs. Thurston Howell III. (Thurston)  'Mrs. Howell, you may  take the stand.' Mrs. Thurston Howell III, will  you tell the court the events that took place  the morning of the 5th? Oh, Thurston, that was beautiful. You really ought to be on the defenders. But you forgot to point your finger at me. Your Honor, I object. What are you objecting to? Your Honor, I feel that they've rehearsed her testimony. No more than he's  rehearsed Gilligan. You brought me up in court on charges? I want to file charges, Your Honor. Alright, but wait your turn.  That'll be Case number 4. Now, please. Let us get  on with the testimony. Your Honor, would you mind  getting another gavel? Why? That one's  squirting milk. Please. Let's get on  with the case. - Mrs. Howell, if you please?  - Now, let's see. That was the morning that  Mr. Howell offered Gilligan a job, and he agreed  to dig the barbeque pit. Thank you very much,  Mrs. Howell. Your witness. Watch me break her testimony. Mrs. Howell. Did Mr. Howell use those exact words? That he had a job for him? Or did he say that he had something that he wanted Gilligan to do for him? - I object.  - What is your objection? Just gimme a minute.  I'll think of something. Ms. Ginger Grant.  Just tell the court. Do you recall hearing me say  that I was hiring Gilligan? Yes, Mr. Howell. You told me that you'd just hired him to dig the barbecue pit. Howell bribed her. Same way  he tried to bribe you. That's defamation  of character. I want to sue that man  for libel and slander. That'll be Case number 5. He said I was bribed. I want to file charges too. Case number 6. Your Honor, I do wish that  you get another gavel. - Ginger's very damaging to us.  - Yeah. Her testimony. No.  Her legs. I'd gone to ask Gilligan if I could help with his fish trap. He said he first had to do a favor for Mr. Howell. Aha! It was a favor. Your Honor, I want to file  charges against Mary Ann. (Professor)  'Against Mary Ann?  For what?' For murder. - Murder?  - Her testimony's killing me. Did Mr. Howell  at any time, call it a job? No. Did he pay you  any money for it? No. [whispering]  Nice testimony. If you get stuck  for an answer during the rest  of the trial, look at me and I'll hold up a finger.  Your witness, Mr. Howell. Gilligan, my boy. Isn't it true  that I hired you that morning? You asked me if I'd time to do something for you. You never paid me a single penny. I didn't ask that. (Gilligan)  'You showed me where you  wanted the barbeque pit.' Your Honor. You never talked about something for me the penny mention work of barbeque pit. Your Honor. They are  using signals. - I want to file charges.  - You have to wait for mine. - Order in the court!  - Watch it. Professor is thinking for half an hour. What's he thinking about? Sit down, Gilligan.  You're making me nervous. Oh. Alright, everybody.  The judge is coming back. Ladies and gentlemen,  I've reached a decision. Oh, don't keep the boy  waiting any longer. - Tell them I won the verdict.  - Oh, I can't tell that. Gilligan, that means that the treasure chest is yours. Wait, wait.  Gilligan didn't win either. - Huh?  - Let me explain. Ever since we were shipwrecked  on this island, we've shared the hardships, the work,  the fish we catch, the fruit 'the water, everything.' We shared  and we've shared alike. I choose to look upon  the treasure chest as one of the natural resources  of this island. By custom and usage, de facto.  It belongs to all of us. Let's go open it. Come on. Wait!  Don't cut that, Professor. I've got to own that treasure chest. Now, no one has seen it. I'll give you a $100,000  for your five shares of it. - Hundred thousand dollars?  - That's $20,000 a piece. - I'll take the treasure chest. - Me too. - The treasure.  - Cut the vine, Professor. Stop! Two hundred  and fifty thousand dollars. Stop.  A half a million. Huh! It's a 100,000 a piece. - Yeah.  - Yes. Mr. Howell, you just bought  yourself a treasure. Look at that.  Big-giant-black pearls. Oh. I wonder what they did to get a little oyster to make a pearl this size. Must have used whips. No! No!  It's a cannon ball. [crying] It was sporting of all of you  not to accept the money. We couldn't. We all thought there was treasure in the chest. I still say it was sporting.  It's stupid, but sporting. - Darling, it's your toss.  - Oh, yes. Yes, of course. That's pretty good, Mr. Howell. You got two, four, six boards. Well, as I always say the family that bowls together...splits. ¶ Now this is the tale  of our castaways ¶ ¶ They're here  for a long, long time ¶ ¶ They'll have to make  the best of things ¶ ¶ It's an uphill climb ¶ ¶ The first mate  and his Skipper too ¶ ¶ Will do their very best ¶ ¶ To make  the others comfortable ¶ ¶ In the tropic island nest ¶ ¶ No phone, no lights,  no motorcars ¶ ¶ Not a single luxury ¶ ¶ Like Robinson Crusoe ¶ ¶ It's primitive as can be ¶ ¶ So join us here  each week my friends ¶ ¶ You're sure to get a smile ¶ ¶ From seven  stranded castaways ¶ ¶ Here on Gilligan's isle ¶
