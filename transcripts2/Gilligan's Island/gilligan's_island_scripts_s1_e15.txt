 [water gurgling] [water gurgling continues] Help!  A sea monster. Help. Help. Help.  Run for you life. It's a sea monster.  Help. Help. Skipper, help. Sea monster.  Help. Help. Sea monster. (Gilligan)  'Help.' [oriental music] And then I see the saw serpent. I mean I ser the saw seapent. Gilligan, little buddy,  please now calm down and just tell us  what happened. That's what I'm trying to do. I was fishing for lobster when suddenly I saw the ser seapent. The saw serpent, a sea, I saw a thing. Gilligan, your panic  is perfectly understandable. It is? Naturally, anyone who saw a sea serpent would be terrified. How come everybody's standing  here like I didn't see one? Because you didn't. It had one big eye, long neck,  was covered with green things. Listen to me, there is no such thing as a sea serpent. Sailing men from time immemorial in Norse legends, in Greek mythology and Phoenician times all thought they saw things that didn't exist. They did? Actually what they saw was a giant squid or a whale or an overgrown eel or even an octopus, which one did you see? One with one big eye, long neck, and covered with green things. I give up. Skipper, you talk to him. Skipper, I saw with my own two eyes. - Gilligan, little--  - It has one big eye. Oop. - Gilligan, do you trust me?  - Of course, I do. Then go back down to the lagoon and start picking more lobsters. But Skipper, what if the-- Gilligan, all you have  to do is just say to yourself "There is no sea serpent,  there is no sea serpent. There is no sea serpent.  There is no sea serpent!" There is no sea serpent. There is no sea serpent. There is too a sea serpent. There is two a sea serpent. Oh, it's you, Mr. Howell. You scared me. I, Thurston Howell III,  scare you? That's absurd. Thought you're sea monster with big eye, long neck, green thing. Please, I don't think  I look like that. Not you, Mr. Howell, the sea  monster. That's how he looks. Well, I can help you capture this creature from the deep, hm? Capture it? I'll take it home and give it the freedom of my swimming pool. Can't you just picture  my guests falling into the pool while I'm coming up astride  a sea serpent, such laughs. - You don't believe me either.  - No, of course not. No, I think it's just  a giant squid or an octopus. However, if you spot  a mermaid, sing out! Spots a mermaid.. Oh, boy, I tell you.. Be careful, be careful. That point is pointy-pointy. Oh, by George, and I've got the money to buy George. That's a Japanese sailor. - Shh.  - Shh. - You officer?  - Officer? I'm an officer in 11 different companies. That's go-o-od.  Good. I have divisions in England, France, Italy, the Near East Far East and Middle East. It's our great honor,  uh, to capture you. Capture me? - You prisoner. Come with me.  - Wait a minute! That's incredible. That's impossible. It's credible and possible. - Sayonara.  - Sayona.. One minute, Mr. Howell was there, next minute, poof, gone. He manages to be somewhere else  when there's work, he's hiding. Yeah. But first time ever in the stomach of a sea serpent. - Hi, Gilligan.  - Hi, don't go swimming. I'm not exactly dressed for it. Ginger, you see if  you can calm him down. - You do look kinda worried.  - No, I'm not worried. I'm not least bit worried. Scared, yeah, but not worried. He's upset because he thinks  Mr. Howell has disappeared. Oh, would you like me  to help you go look for him? - No.  - W-well, I could go first. - It's too dangerous for a lady. - Well, you could go first. No it's too dangerous for a man. How about you, professor? You wanna go along with us? No, Gilligan, I'm gonna stay  right here and finish my work. [sighs] - You still behind me, Ginger?  - Right behind you, Gilligan. I was walking on this path not even thinking of lobsters let alone sea monsters and believe me I'd let alone sea monsters if I had my choice. I was standing right over here.  Mr. Howell came up to me and then he started walking up  the beach and I stood here.. Ginger?  You still behind me? [Ginger screaming] - What was that?  - It sounded like Ginger. But she's with Gilligan. Professor, I refuse  to listen anything more. - Gilligan's a very nice boy.  - I didn't mean it like that. Well, what's happening? I was telling that her husband has been eaten by a sea serpent. Oh, that's silly, Thurston wasn't even dressed for dinner. Did you say he was eaten  by a sea serpent? - No, no, no. Gilligan said it. - Oh, that's different. Stay and wait for the Skipper,  send him to the lagoon. Come on, Mary Ann.  I'll explain it on the way. I'll save you, Ginger.  I'll save you. Don't give up,  Ginger. Ginger? Hold your breath.  I'll save you. - You don't believe him, do you? - No, but there may be trouble. - You stay here.  - Why? Because I'm gonna find out exactly what's happening. - I'll save you. I'll save you. - Gilligan. - Gilligan, what happened?  - The sea serpent ate Ginger. - Why did she scream?  - Because it hurts. Gilligan, you get  hold of yourself and tell me step by step  exactly what happened? Well, Ginger and me came down from camp to the beach. That is, I did. Ginger became an appetizer. In other words, she was standing there where Mary Ann is now? - Where Mary Ann isn't. - Gilligan, for the last time.. [dramatic music] Mary Ann.  Mary Ann. Mary Ann.  Mary Ann. Professor, it's just no use. Mary Ann's become a salad. There's a perfectly logical  and normal reason for what's happening. - Uh-huh, a hungry sea serpent. - Nonsense. Maybe, you're right. After Mr. Howell, Ginger and Mary Ann, he's probably full. I'll stand guard here,  you go back to camp and help Mrs. Howell  find the Skipper. - You'll stay right here?  - I promise. - Even if you're eaten?  - Gilligan, will you hurry up? Right. Mary Ann. Hello, Skipper.  Mrs. Howell.. Oh. Oh, poor Mrs. Howell. Well, at least,  she's with Mr. Howell now. Gilligan. Oh, Skipper,  am I glad to see you. - I told you to go get lobsters. - Oh, is that a big mistake. - W-where is everybody?  - Out to lunch. - Out for lunch?  - The hard way. Gilligan, please, now why don't you start making some sense? Right, make some sense.  Where shall I begin? Start at the beginning, that's always a good place. - I was catching lobster, right? - Right. - I saw the sea serpent, right? - Right. Then he ate Mr. Howell, Ginger, Mary Ann, and poor Mrs. Howell. Gilligan, I'm not gonna lose my temper, am I? I'm not gonna get angry and blow my top, am I? - No, I'll make you start over. - You don't believe me, do you? Don't wanna hurt your feelings, but no, I don't believe you. Then I don't wanna  talk about it. - Now, tell me what happened.  - Nothing happened. Gilligan, where is everybody gone? You and me are here.  Professor's down at the beach. The rest, they all got  eaten up by a-- - Ah.  - Sea serpent, so there. I suppose that you saw them eaten by the sea serpent? - No, not exactly. - Now, we're getting someplace. - We are.  - Yes, we are. We're getting down at the beach and find the professor. C'mon. - I'm not going back down there. - Alright, suit yourself. Don't forget to say hello  to Mrs. Howell for me. Very ingenious. Very ingenious. Well, I'm glad  that you approve. You notice how he's got  this constructed? If we try to squeeze through or push or pull these bamboo poles it tightens the wire and pulls  the pin out of the grenade. And pow, splash, pow! Must you be so graphic? You don't understand,  it could be to our advantage. The "pow" or the "splash"? I meant we might be able to reason with the Japanese sailor. Only a person of intelligence  could have constructed this barricade as quickly  and efficiently as he did. - He's smarter than we are.  - What do you mean? Well, he's outside.  We're inside. [whistling] Oh, he speaks English. [birds chirping] Alright, now.  Time for interrogation. Now, look, this is really all quite unnecessary. The war has been over for more than 20 years. I've heard of sore losers,  but he's ridiculous. [speaking Japanese] You don't call me ridiculous. Surely you must've heard the ending of the war on your radio. Radio broke in 19...42. Transmitter, too. Pretty soon, I get spare parts. - When?  - Oh, when I get leave. Best spare parts come Japan.  Cheaper, too. Have you heard about  our discount houses? Using code.  Don't talk in code. Just give me information of supply depot, uh, ammunition headquarters, everything. Look, there is no ammunition. There are no headquarters. The war is over. What's the matter with you?  You think I'm dumbbell? Huh? I know American.  I went to American college. I graduated...UCLA. - That explains everything.  - What do you mean? Well, he's obviously not a Harvard man. Look at the cut of his trousers. [dramatic music] I don't believe it.  I don't believe it. I believe it. It's right here. I haven't seen one of these  since the war. Which one is it? The Monitor or the Merrimack? Not the Civil War,  you lunkhead! Look at the name  of the boat. Somebody sure has terrible handwriting. I can't make out USS anything. Gilligan,  it's Japanese. This clears a lot of things.  It's in papers all the time. You read where they left some  Japanese on a deserted island. They don't know  the war is over yet. It looks a lot bigger  when it was a sea serpent. They must have the rest  of the group held captive. - It's up to us to save 'em.  - That's right, Gilligan. All I have to do  is get in the sub sail to Hawaii  and bring back help. - You're a genius, Skipper.  - I know. With the sub gone,  it wouldn't make sense. That sailor wouldn't dare  kill you and rest of the group. - Me? How do I get captured? - I have faith in you, Gilligan. - Oh, thanks, Skipper.  - Oops. - Bon voyage. Have a good trip. - Wait a minute, Gilligan. - I'm stuck.  - You can't get in? - No, Gilligan.  - You can't get out? - No, Gilligan.  - Oh, that's why you're stuck. Yes, Gilligan. Here, some coconut oil to make you slippery. - Coconut oil is gooey. - It'll make you more slippery. Here, come on. Let's go. - See? Here we go.  - Hey, you working! Yeah. Come on. Let's go. - Turning me the wrong way.  - Oh, oh, here. See it works. That's right, little buddy,  it worked fine. Now get ready. You're gonna have  to captain the submarine. - Me?  - Yes. Get down there  behind that wheel. It's simple, just drive it  like an automobile. - Are you sure?  - Yes. Just look at the dashboard  and follow the instructions. If you say so. Head Northwest  and you'll hit Hawaii. You can depend on me,  Skipper. I wish you hadn't  said that, Gilligan. Just remember, your life is in my hands. Wish you hadn't  said that either. Here we go. Good luck, little buddy. [water gurgling] I forgot it was a convertible. No, no. Hey, you, there are  seven people captured on an island by  a Japanese sailor. Hey, you. Look, I know exactly where they are, come on, come on. Come on, hurry up, we gotta hurry, come on, let's go. Follow me, I know exactly where they are. Gilligan. Skipper? How did you get to Hawaii? - You never left the lagoon.  - I didn't? - I told you to head northwest. - I know that. Well, then, why didn't  you do what I told you? You didn't tell what northwest looked like in Japanese. - Japanese?  - Yeah. All those letters down there written like that. Never thought of that. Well, Gilligan, we gotta find that sailor, have him teach you. - I could learn real fast.  - Good, Gilligan. Now, if you were a Japanese  sailor, where would you be? In Tokyo. I mean here  on the island, Gilligan. We got to find  that Japanese sailor. Come on. Would you settle say for general manager in my European sales? I'm Japanese sailor. Imperial Navy,  I'm loyal to my Emperor. Loyalty is something I admire in every manager. It's a positive virtue but would you be loyal say to $50,000? No, no, no, but thank you  for important information. Information? What information? That war is nearly over and that American Army  is in bad, bad shape. I never said the American Army was in bad shape. Must be, to make men  like you officer. I go talk to  lady prisoner. Arigato! [oriental music] [music continues] You're married  to big mouth, huh? I'm Mrs. Thurston Howell III. Have been two other like that? There may be  a Thurston Howell IV. Wonder why Emperor want  United States. I demand you let us  out of here immediately. Oh, no, can't do. Then I have nothing more  to say to you. You, you camera bug. I change my mind. Then you're gonna  let us go free? No. I was going  to torture your husband. But now I'll leave  that to you. Oh, Mary Ann, I think I've been insulted. Ah, you, you're not scared, huh? - Maybe you give me information? - I'd rather die. That could be arranged. Ooh. Oh, hey, don't go away. No. American movie star, she hurt. Oh, I-I think  I sprained my ankle. - Oh, it's too bad.  - Maybe if you rub it. I-I mean men's hands  are so strong. I was the strongest sailor in whole navy. I broke five boards, one inch thick, with karate. And you're handsome too. Handsome?  Oh, no. Yes, you are. Good looking, maybe. Very, very good rooking. You good looking too. Thanks. You know if you were  back in Hollywood now they'd go crazy about you? Hollywood?  Me in movies? Oh, yes, there's  lots and lots of parts for big, strong Japanese men. I could play a movie star  like, uh, Robert Taylor, huh? Or like Robert Montgomery, huh? How about the other one,  Lloyd Bridges? Yes, you've got such smooth hair and a handsome face. And good looking? (both)  Very good rooking. And strong hands. Oh, please. You steam glasses. Ginger, I wouldn't  do that. Why not? I don't think he's had a shore leave in over 20 years. - I demand that you release us. - After all, the war is over. And I won't speak  to you again if you don't. How you say "no" in English? Ah. No! [birds chirping] I haven't sleep for 48 hours.  I must sleep. You seem to be forgetting the rules of the Geneva Conference. Officers are entitled to special treatment. Oh, well, you get  special prison camp. I'm referring to the cocktail hour. You sure he's on your side? Not always. I sleep over there. Don't you escape, huh? Escape? The way you fixed this chicken coop, how am I gonna escape? Oh, true.  True. Say, how did you  learn to do this? - Pictures.  - Pictures? American pictures  with John Wayne. - He's up there.  - Oh. - What are we gonna do?  - Watch and see what he does. - Keep an eye on him.  - Yeah. What are you gonna do? - I'm gonna let them out.  - Okay. - If he makes a move, whistle. - Oh, like this? [whistles] - You wanna get us captured?  - No. [snoring] Counting on you now, Gilligan. Don't worry, Skipper.  Your life is in my hands. I wish you wouldn't keep saying that. Now, watch him. [snoring] - Oh, am I glad--  - Shh. I'll have you out of here in no time. Skipper, it'll take you a week  to saw through those even if you had a saw. - No, don't, don't do that.  - Why not? Because of "pow" and "smash" and other gory details I can't go into now. 'Cause he's got it  rigged with grenades. - The slightest pressure and--  - "Pow." I'll dig you out. [snoring] [snoring] [snoring continues] [snoring continues] - Skipper, how you doing?  - Shh. Don't bother me,  I'm doing fine. - Hi, girls.  - Hi. Hold this, will you? [metal clinking] Gilligan. Here, Skipper, use this,  it'll be faster. Thanks. He's gone. He was the only one who could've taught us to run that submarine. It can't be, Skipper.  It can't be. I think he's headed  for Hollywood. We gotta get to that sub  before he does. Come on. Extremely poor seamanship. He'd be drummed out of  the Sunnybrook Yacht Club. I can't understand it. He's driving like he was drunk. He's not drunk, Skipper. He not have glasses on. ¶ They're here for  a long, long time ¶ ¶ They'll have to make  the best of things ¶ ¶ It's an uphill climb ¶ ¶ The first mate  and his skipper too ¶ ¶ Will do their very best ¶ ¶ To make the others  comfortable ¶ ¶ In the tropic island nest ¶ ¶ No phone, no lights,  no motorcar ¶ ¶ Not a single luxury ¶ ¶ Like Robinson Crusoe ¶ ¶ It's primitive as can be ¶ ¶ So join us here  each week my friends ¶ ¶ You're sure to get a smile ¶ ¶ From seven  stranded castaways ¶ ¶ Here on Gilligan's isle ¶¶
