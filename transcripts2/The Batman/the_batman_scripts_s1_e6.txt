 SO FAR. KATSU'S EXTENSIVE COLLECTION OF ANTIQUES REMAINED INTACT, BUT, CURIOUSLY, SECURITY CAMERAS CAPTURED AN IMAGE OF WHAT APPEARED TO BE A COSTUMED CATWOMAN. WHAT? JOINING ME IS GOTHAM P.D.'s ELLEN YIN. UH, DETECTIVE, COULD THERE BE SOME CONNECTION BETWEEN THIS CATWOMAN AND THE BATMAN? WHILE THERE SEEM TO BE SIMILARITIES IN APPEARANCE AND METHODOLOGY, THEY HAVE ENTIRELY DIFFERENT MOTIVES. HOWEVER, IT'S TOO EARLY TO RULE OUT ANY POSSIBLE LINKS BETWEEN THE CAT AND THE BAT. THIS'LL IMPROVE MY RELATIONS WITH THE POLICE.

[ELEVATOR DINGS] [DING] [MEOWING] I MISSED YOU, TOO, SWEETIES. MAMA HAD TO GO SHOPPING SO SHE COULD FEEL BETTER ABOUT LAST NIGHT'S DISAPPOINTMENT. YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN THE PREY-- A BIG, SHINY PUSSYCAT. [SIGHS] MISSED IT BY A WHISKER. MMM. AT LEAST MY ADRENALINE RUSHED. [READING] HMM. HE LOOKS TALL, DARK AND HANDSOME. CONSIDER SELINA KYLE... CURIOUS.

THIS'LL COME IN HANDY WHEN I'M ON THE PROWL. [SIGHS] [BEEPING] GOT A LITTLE SECURITY FEATURE, DO YOU? Katsu: YOU HAVE FOUND NOTHING ON THIS CATWOMAN? WE MUST INCREASE SECURITY, IN THE EVEN SHE IS FOOLISH ENOUGH TO RETURN. CALL FOR THE DRAGON'S FANGS. SHE WASN'T SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. THE BELT'S LOCK MECHANISM MUST'VE BEEN DAMAGED IN THE FALL. THIS FELINE FATALE IS CERTAINLY PROVING TO BE A SLY ONE. I NEED TO TRACK THAT CAT BEFORE SHE PUTS MY UTILITY BELT TO NO GOOD USE. HMM... [BEEPS] [MACHINE WHIRS] [BEEPING] GOODY. [CRASH] ALFRED, SHUT DOWN THE AUXILIARY BAT-WAVE TRANSMITTER! I BELIEVE THIS WAS THE AUXILIARY TRANSMITTER, SIR. COME ON. START UP. [CRASH] UHH!

IF CATWOMAN WERE SOMEHOW, SOME WAY ABLE TO TRACE THE SIGNALS BACK HERE-- WE WOULD HAVE TO RENAME IT "THE CATCAVE." [MACHINE POWERING UP] AN ACTIVE BAT-WAVE? I WAS CERTAIN I'D DISCONNECTED ALL THE RECEIVERS. SHE TOOK MY REMOTE CONTROL BATARANG. MAYBE THERE'S A WAY TO TRACE THE SIGNAL BACK TO IT... AND CATWOMAN. [DOG BARKING] [GASPS] THE CAT RETURNS TO KATSU. HOW POETIC. HA HA HA HA. ALMOST A HAIKU. I'LL BE SURE TO JOT IT DOWN AS SOON AS I GET HOME. I MUST INSIST YOU STAY. THEN I MUST INSIST YOU EAT STEEL!

Robinson Sprang: A MINIDISC FOUND AT THE SCENE REVEALED A CHART OF JAPANESE ORGANIZED CRIME-- NAMING NAMES-- WITH KATSU AT THE TOP OF A YAKUZA FAMILY, INTENT ON EXPANDING INTO GOTHAM. DETECTIVE, DO YOU HAVE A STATEMENT? REST ASSURED... GOTHAM P.D. IS ARRESTING THE OTHER YAKUZA MEMBERS AS WE SPEAK. SO, WOULD YOU SAY THE IDEA OF A BATMAN/CATWOMAN LINK WASN'T SO FARFETCHED AFTER ALL? YES, IT'S CLEAR NOW THAT THEY WORK TOGETHER TO TAKE DOWN KATSU... AS A VIGILANTE TEAM. OHH... NOT QUITE WHAT I HAD IN MIND WHEN I ENCOURAGED YOU TO MEET WOMEN WHO SHARE YOUR INTERESTS, MASTER BRUCE.
