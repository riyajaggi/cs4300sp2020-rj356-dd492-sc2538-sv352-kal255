 Where've you been? You smashed up Faiza's house? Are you fucking crazy? Faiza and I are over. I apologized. You accepted my apology... and we moved on. You want a fucking baby? Do you think it's a good idea with you being psychotic? - I'm not psychotic! - You destroyed her home! - She destroyed mine! - It was a mistake.

 Fucking my husband is not a mistake, it's a choice! And she's my best friend, - so don't get involved... - I am involved! My family is involved. Our parents know each other. Did you even consider how it would reflect on the family? At the end of the day class just fucking shows up, doesn't it? You can't buy it, it can't be taught... and it can't be married into clearly. They could have you arrested. Did you even consider that? Then we will all be involved.

 Publicly. Maybe think about it next time before letting your class show. Hold your positions. Nice. Hey! Captain Devyani... our daughter-to-be. Tara. Did Tarun send my lehenga? Yeah, but we have to do the fitting as soon as possible, yeah? May we have a picture of you with the family? Not in my uniform, no... It would be great. Just the men and you. You look amazing. Don't worry about it. Bless you. Please come. - Is the Haldi set up, ready? - Yes, it is. The baskets are also ready... we'll put them in the guest rooms tomorrow. Okay and make sure that the... - Hi, Tara. - Hi. - Pavleen. - Nice to meet you. - Karan's friend. - Ah, okay. Is he here? Uh, no actually, but... is there something you'd like me to pass on? No, that's all right, we're just... old buddies, you know. - I thought I'll catch up with him. - Ah, okay. Well, I think you have a lot of work... I'll leave you to it. - Take care. - See you. Weddings aren't private affairs anymore. And the brides are no longer shy. Mr. Ranawat. I am from FWT Lifestyle magazine. We've heard about your merger with Five Seasons and how you intend to convert your Mundota Palace into a seven-star luxury hotel. Care to comment, sir? I'm sorry... it's my son's wedding. Please ask business-related questions at the press conference. Now please go and enjoy yourself. Excuse me. Thank you, sir. He's actually done it. Your landlord has withdrawn all evidence. The police will have to drop charges now. You still want to take him to court? We have a case. What? Do I want to send Gupta to jail? That's your call. He has a daughter. She's a good kid. I'm not sure she needs this right now. Is this about protecting her? I'm sorry. - You worked so hard on this case, I... - Don't worry about me. Anyway, sending one landlord to jail is not going to change anything in this country. Look at this, ma'am. At 2:15 p.m... he drove himself. He left the driver at the office parking lot. He reached Faiza Naqvi's house and roughly half an hour later, he left. These photos were taken five days ago. Oh, Tara. Don't be shy. Tara, I have a huge favor I need to ask of you. I know how busy you guys have been lately but can I give you one more job? Yeah. Can you please distribute all these cards? - I have a lot on my plate right now. - Yeah. - Of course. - Okay. She's such a life saver. - Yeah. - I got to go. I'll see you. Bye. Thanks, Tara. Okay and we are... rolling. You guys look so nice. - Thank you. - Thanks. So... Samar, I'll start with you. Being from the royal family... how do you think that... that affects how you feel about what Devyani does the fact that she's a pilot? I'd say it's absolutely great. It's about time we support ambitious women and stand next to them, support them. No woman in our family has ever worked... she'll be the first. He always knew I was going to be a pilot... that was non-negotiable. Yeah, now who can tell her what to do? I know the family I'm marrying into and the responsibility that I have and... I would never do anything to embarrass them or shame them... and... they trust me. Yeah... and we are very proud of her. Please. - Greetings, sir. - Greetings. - Greetings. - Greetings, greetings. - You're looking so sweet! - Please stop... And this beautiful lady is my daughter-in-law. Devyani, this is Jan, the director of Five Seasons. I'm very pleased to meet you. It's nice to meet you too. And how beautiful you look. Thank you. Come. Are you enjoying your big fat Indian wedding experience? - Yes, thank you, very much. - Lovely. This is mehendi. The temporary tattoos you were talking about? Ah, henna! Yeah. - Namaste. - I'd love to get something small. You're most welcome, she's here only for you. What's your name? Pooja. Will you make a nice design on her hand? Yes! And for you? Something small, a good luck charm. She's giving me a mark to ward off evil. Nice. So... I just spoke to Kumar sir. Mrs. Yadav's cousin. Okay. The wedding is going to be the announcement of the political alliance. They want to make a big splash. - It'll be huge. - Let's get it. I'm not losing another wedding. You won't! The Yadavs will get married in Harmony. Tell us your plan. There is no agency bigger than Harmony. This type of family will only fancy a grand celebration. When we get complacent... someone else gets photographed. So... what is your plan? We can make sure they know about Karan. Know what? That he's a pervert. - He's not a pervert. - The investigation is still underway. Who cares what he is? As long as it's not good for their reputation to hire him. It's fine by me. Ma'am, here's your room, and this for you. Thank you, dear. Pant, please go outside and check the setting and you, come quickly, there are many rooms left. - Could you guys hurry up? - Okay. Put one in this room. I'll put one in the room ahead. Get some more baskets from downstairs. Uh... Sorry... sorry. Wait! Wait, please! Pooja! Do you know who it was? Do you know him? He's still in the room... I locked the door from outside. Come with me, I'm going to see this fucker... No! No, don't worry, nothing will happen to you. We shouldn't do anything. We should just tell the family, they will press charges. - Let them handle it legally. - But let's at least go and... I will go speak to Mr. Ranawat. Jazz, show me the room first. This was the room. - Open the door. - Wait, don't open that door! First, I need to talk to my father. Fine. Listen, please remember that we are with you. I'm dealing with royalty here. Nothing is above the law. The police will help you. We are with you. I'm sorry... I don't know what else to say. Don't be silly... she has every right to be angry. What did you tell your parents? They're not stupid. Dad said, live by his rules... or leave. Then leave. You need to get your shit together. You're a grown woman. What do you want me to do, leave my aging parents? Come on. You're not staying here out of concern for your aging parents. You're staying here because you're dependent on them. You need to start working, Faiza. - I am working, with my mother. - It's an NGO! It's amazing... but it's not bringing in any income. You always said you wanted to open your own place... a store. You have great taste. You have great style. What you wear, how you are... use it. Open your own place. I can finance it no, it'll be a proper deal, a proper business deal. Why are you doing this? I hate the idea... of you being answerable to anyone. First Bilal. Now your dad. Fuck them. Namaste, ma'am. Namaste. Has Adil come? No... but Shibani ma'am is here. She's in the drawing room. - Shibani? - Yes. - Keep this. - Okay. I really wish we hadn't ended things like that. Please. Don't embarrass me, just... forget it. Are you happy at Harmony? I'm okay. How are you? How's Karan? It's been rough. You need to be careful. What do you mean? Harmony is going to use Karan's case... for the Yadav wedding. It's not going to be decent. Of course. They're planning to put it out everywhere even Delhi Times. You should call Prabhat and ask him to try and stop it. Why are you helping us? I'm not helping you... I was never here. I don't want my daughter to grow up in a world that is mean. The moment the agreement is ready, please send it home. Okay. It's nice. Any particular reason you want to live here? I'll be close to you. There's no need for that. The rate here is very high. At least look at the whole apartment! Come on, see it. Adil suggested looking in this area. He wants to get us a nice home. Just because Adil said so, you're sold? You have to make up with him. Make up? He came home at 4:00 a.m. last night! Please don't interfere, Mummy. I know you're worried. Don't you remember that I was the one who told you not to let Faiza live in your house? It's a bad time, but it will pass. Now listen to me carefully. Adil is not going to leave you. That girl is Muslim and she's a divorcee. Let her cry. You are his wife. You'll always come first. Keep him happy. When he comes home, give him your love. Spend time with him. Go out with him. Be his wife. You've done so much to get this far... think about that. Get me Prabhat on the phone. Some samples have come. Ma'am, Devyani is here to meet Pooja. - She's waiting in your cabin. - Why? I don't know. She's a very strong lady, Tara ma'am. She's a pilot, she could crash the wedding. Was that a joke? Please, Jazz. Sorry, ma'am. Sorry. I can't believe this. They're here. I'm so sorry, Pooja. I honestly don't know what to say to you. Please sit. She's going to file. I'm taking her to the station from here. Everyone was happy, everything was... going so well. I'm sorry, ma'am. This shouldn't have happened at your wedding. And what happened to you... shouldn't have happened either. But it's happened, so now what can we do? Let me help you. I can give you two lakhs in cash. What are you doing? - Two lakhs is a lot of money... - Devyani, please stop... How many months would you need to work to earn two lakhs? What, are you for real?! Listen to me... and don't get involved in this. This is better than dealing with cops and lawyers... Pooja... you do not have to listen to her. Okay? Five lakhs. Cash. Deal. Thank you. That's it? You've shown your true colors? I won't earn that much, even in my dreams... If this was about money, then you should have said that earlier! - Stop it, Karan. - No, this isn't just about her! This isn't just about you! This is about every other woman that Ranawat molests! He'll think that he can keep doing this now that he knows the price! Back off, you're scaring her! Do you realize how many people will suffer because of your decision? You're a coward! - You could have done something! - What the fuck, Karan? You... you can't talk to her like this. And what the hell happened to you? I thought you couldn't bear to see his face! I can't, but the decision is not mine to make - I have to respect her. - Do you realize on how many levels this is wrong? - You're a woman, for God's sake! - Which is why I will not judge her! Hey. How are you, man? At least talk to me. Don't ignore me, Karan. You know I called your house six times. I do not want to talk to you, Nawab. - Karan, are you coming? - He's coming. Listen. Don't do this. Talk to me, we can work something out. I do not want to talk to you. Karan... Hello, you two! Ruchi's right there. Hey! Hi! Hi! How gorgeous you look! So glad you could make it. You know I never miss any of your parties, right? Not on purpose anyway. You okay? Yeah, of course. I didn't invite Faiza. Oh, I didn't... Why, you should have. Not after what she did to you. We're all on your side, baby. What is this? I know, I'm on it, okay? I don't know how it leaked, or who leaked it... - but I'm going to find... - You recorded us! You recorded me without me knowing! No, it's the CCTV footage. - I didn't even realize... - You didn't realize? - What am I supposed to do now?! - Stop shouting. I will have it off the internet by this afternoon, okay? I can get it deleted from all of... I will be blamed for all of this. I will have to leave the office. My reputation will be ruined. You know that, right? I'll be the one to blame. Did I tell you about the Ranawats? Pooja, the mehendi girl. They paid her off. Five lakhs. That's it? Five lakhs is a lot of money. He fucking molested her. She should have been smarter. Five lakhs barely cuts it. Nothing cuts it, if you ask me. Everybody has their price. I... I must tell you that as a family we are... very grateful to you, the way you... handled the situation, with so much dignity. You know how it is. - He's a man. - I should have known better. I fell in love and... I'm sorry. I understand how difficult this must be for you and... we would... we would really like to help, you know, to see that... just to see that you're comfortable... until of course you find something more substantial. So... this is for you. Thank you for this... but I could never take money from Adil. It would never feel right. Of course. Can you unzip this? I need to sleep. Looking at this, one wouldn't believe that royalty has been abolished in India. There is nothing commonplace about the Ranawats. Sure... they have moved with the times and the prince is marrying a pilot. But reverence... is ingrained in our DNA. For us, blue blood will always rank higher than red. Even in the twenty-first century, royalty will reign. Their customs will stay the same. Their subjects will remain as loyal and their transgressions will be as accepted. If it was me, I'd have never accepted the money. Bullshit. It's not bullshit. Some things are not okay. I'd break his teeth, if it was me. No, I've had too much... if I drink now, I'll start crying. Why are you making me cry? - Okay, fine. - Hmm. - Give it then. - Take it then. Come, let's go for a walk. Come. How much will you shoot? You're in my frame. Really? And you're in my palace. Your palace? Whenever I enter a palace... I feel like, I lived here at some point... centuries ago. So do you believe in past life then? Of course. There can't be just one life. Were you a princess? A queen. - What? - What? What? What? Hmm... tell me. What I can do for you? Uh, I... I wanted to ask you something... Hmm. Uh... A very powerful man has molested a young woman. Where? At his son's wedding. We were organizing it. This happens in the wedding business as well? Nothing will happen to him. No punishment. - Do you know the girl? - Yes. Is there anything I can do? What would you like to do? - I want to teach him a lesson. - We can teach him a lesson. Now let us know how severe you'd like it to be. I mean... fingers, hands, legs... dick or corpse? Uh... No, I... I don't know... no actually... I... I don't... Sorry, I'm going to go. And now my new daughter... has an important announcement to make. Our honored guests from oversees are here for a very special reason today. I'm very happy to announce that the Mundota Palace will be merging with the Five Seasons brand. The palace is now open to anyone who would like to experience a taste of royalty. I have a question. Sir, by when do you think the hotel project would be completed? We are hoping the end of... 2020. The hotel will be the epitome of luxury. No other state in the country will have this kind of grandeur. Mr. Ranawat... congratulations on the merger. Although, we have reports that you have molested the mehendi girl at your son's wedding. What are your comments on that? That is a very serious accusation, young lady. Yes, it is... which is why we need a comment. Ma'am... you are insulting our family. This is a malicious rumor and we will not engage in it. I would request you to please leave. Gladly. Sir, please, one question! The Ranawat family won't be taking any further personal questions on this subject. Isn't that journalist your friend? That is a very serious accusation, young lady. Hey, hold this. - Raman, hand me the towel. - Ooh, what's this? - Guys, Karan has received a love letter! - Stop it! Stop... "Why are you doing this to me? Let's talk." Yours forever... Nawab"? So... is that how homos talk to each other? Nawab wrote the letter. How does that make me gay? So, is the love one-sided then? Of course, dude. Karan? Is everything okay? I want to file a PIL against article 377. You want to file a Public Interest Litigation? Yeah. Can I do it tomorrow? Yes, you can. But you could have just come to office for that. You weren't picking up your phone... and I had to know right now.
