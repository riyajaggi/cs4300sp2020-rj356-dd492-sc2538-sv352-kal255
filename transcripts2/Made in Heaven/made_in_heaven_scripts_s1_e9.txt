 Congratulations on your daughter's farewell. We are very happy for you. I don't feel like I'm losing my daughter instead, I feel like I'm gaining a son. - So happy to hear that. - A son. Namaste! Look... every father wishes the best for his son. Now Vishal's future is bright... and this union is not just of two families... but of two parties. Right? See, I want to tell you... that whatever's happening... We need people like you. Vocal. Your argument was very tight. Wonderful!

 The tragedy is that in this atmosphere, your courage won't be rewarded. The ruling party is keeping an eye on people like you. Smile. Come on, carefully. I am truly honored to become a part of the Yadav family. He is now the heir to the Rashtriya Jan Seva Party! He has our full support. Thank you, thank you so much. What's up with her? Is she drunk? I think she's drugged. Homosexuality in India is nothing new. Intolerance is. We have temples with carvings that... We have temples with carvings that depict both men and women engaging in sex with the same gender. So I ask you... whose culture is this? Love is love! Love is love! Love is love! Love is love! Congrats, darling. That was so insane! Mr. Karan Mehra, who has petitioned the supreme court... - You went for that? - How was it? Against Section 377. Homosexuality... It was fantastic. The students really loved him. It was really nice. Will India finally decriminalize homosexuality, the question remains. For further updates, stay tuned. We will be right back. Take this. Hi! - Jazz, right? - Yeah. Yeah, hi. Welcome home. I'm so glad you could make it. Come on in. Let me get you a drink. This way, come. You know, it's so nice that you could make it. Kabir's been telling me, Jazz is so much fun and I was like, "Dude, you have to call her home." I thought this was Kabir's home. It is. We live together. Happy birthday! Happy birthday to you! Can I have some? They're becoming a little too forward. This is completely against the culture of our nation. We won't let this slide. What do they know about India's history? They are just spouting Western ideas. This won't be allowed in India! All hail the motherland! "Why are you doing this to me, let's talk." Yours forever... Nawab"? So is that how homos talk to each other? Nawab wrote the letter. - How does that make me gay? - So the love is one-sided? Of course, dude. I'm straight. Hey, Bhatia. - What is this? - You couldn't find anyone else? I hope you're not going fuck us in the backside. So you like Karan, huh? Nawab is a homo. - We can talk something out... - Nawab is a homo! Nawab is a homo! Nawab is a homo! Nawab is a homo! Nawab is a homo! Nawab is a homo! Nawab is a homo! Nawab is a homo! Nawab is a homo! Nawab is a homo! Nawab is a homo! Nawab is a homo! She's not picking up. Ma'am, this outfit is for Qawwali night... but we have to fit it. Excuse me. - Hi, morning. - Hi, hello. - How are you doing? - Hello, good. - Hello. - Hello. Ma'am, your dresses. Can I help you with something? No. I'll try it myself. Uh... Tara, have you seen my phone? No. Does it fit fine? - It's done? - Let's go. Do you want to try something else? Wouldn't... wouldn't you want to try some of the other... We'll see it later. I think she left her phone. That's mine. Where was it? Inside. I don't think she tried it. - She made a call. - Really? Call it. - Hello? - Hi, this is... Dude, something is very off. If you inspect each and every flower it'll take ten years to organize this wedding! It's the party leader's bungalow! We have to check! Then triple your staff! Everyday is a new fucking situation. Dora, oh, Dora... My lovely Dora... Go to sleep now... Grow up soon... A prince will come for you... And take you as his bride... Hi. Where's the bride? Are you the bride, or is it Dora? Not me, my Aunt Nutan is the bride. And where is she? She's locked in the room. Why is she locked? Let's go play with her. She never plays, she only cries all the time. Can I play with Dora? Here, this is for Dora. It's too big for her. I know it's too big for her, it's just when she grows up it'll fit her. - So save it for her. - When she gets married? This is for... your Aunt Nutan, okay? As she is getting married, okay? Where's the place for this? That's perfect. We'll put it here... and you promise you're going to give it to her? Yeah? It'll be a secret between the three of us? Pinky promise? It's going to be our secret. Three of us. Okay, go! Go, go, go! Nutan is the best wife I could have asked for. She belongs to the world of politics. She's seen the life. People say that I have it in me to be the next PM of this country. And I think me and Nutan can make this pair and we have this coalition on the government and we... - Sir? - What is it? - Is something wrong? - No, that's all fine. I just meant... What? - What I'm asking you... - Yeah? How do you feel about her as a person? Ah... - As a person! - As a human being, what do you... As a human, correct, yeah. Sure. As a person, she is... lovely. And she is... I'll change the battery, one second. Yeah, you change the battery, I'll just take a... - smoke break. - Okay. Relax, it's okay. Okay? Just keep saying good things. Sir, you can't... you can't smoke inside here. All my equipment is here so... I've already lit it. Just say she's great, she's got a good personality. - Hello, Vishal sir. - Hello. - Can you have a look at this? - Can we do this later? Yes, sure. Jazz, pass me the battery. I'm not your assistant. It's... just a battery. Nutan is wonderful, bright and vivacious. She is full of questions and intrigue and I think her energy will always compliment mine. Jai Hind. I'm really sorry. About what? I messed your life up. No, you didn't. My life is awesome. You were getting married. If nothing had happened between us, then... It wasn't meant to be. Hey. It's not your fault. I'm the one that should have stayed away. All those things Natasha said about you. I don't care. I do. That isn't the truth. I don't know, I just feel so responsible. Hey. Don't be crazy. You're a really good person. I want you to be really happy. Marry me. Marry me. In case you... didn't hear the first time. We have a big game coming up today... and we have to win it. - Raman. - Sir. You'll play in the center today. - Forward? - Woah, bro. You just got promoted. Sir, Nawab? Nawab has left the school. - He's gone to study in Woodstock. - What? - In Musoorie. - You knew about this? Okay boys, on the court. Let's go, five minutes. Come on. Come on, let's go. Where the fuck is Dora? Who is Dora? Her doll! This is your informant? You're relying on a six-year-old? And her doll? Sweetheart, where's Dora? - Where's Dora? - She died. See... she's alive. Really? Yeah. All she needs is some sunlight. Hold her. They're forcing her to marry Vishal. They don't want her to be with me. Why, because you're Christian? Yeah, and because I'm... just an engineer. Last time she called, she was slurring. Nobody can meet her, all our friends have tried. And obviously, I can't go to the cops. Why not? Nutan's sister committed suicide... because they had her boyfriend killed. - What? - Yeah. Nobody knows about this, the whole news was... squashed. They just said that she had a chemical imbalance. Where are your parents? In Cochin. They have no clue about any of this. I don't know what to do. I don't know if there's any... Can you help us? Please. I'm just scared that she's going to do something to herself. Fucking scary. It's fucking Delhi. John should call the cops. Cops are not going to do anything. - He's some random guy... - Yeah, so he can take his friends... make a scene, call the press, he has to do something... What can he do? Do you have any idea how powerful these Yadavs are? Who is going to mess with them? They'll fuck you up. So no one can do anything? Only the ruling party can bring them down. You think Nutan will kill herself? Yes, this is good. She can wear this. Fix this one. I spoke to John. Don't drink anything, don't eat anything. They're drugging you. How can you not find them? They're very big. Check in the cupboard. - We're going to help you. - What happened? Nothing, Auntie. The light... we're almost set up, it'll take a minute. - We're almost ready. - Take some good pictures. Of course. Auntie, there's a lot of confusion with the seating plan can you come and check once? - I'm supervising the photo shoot. - It'll take five minutes. The Home Minister still hasn't confirmed if he's coming - and we have no idea where to seat him. - Why can't Tara handle this? Auntie, I'll do the photo shoot, don't worry. It'll only take five minutes, Auntie. Wait one minute. Rohini? Rohini! Come quickly. - Give her some juice. - Let's go, ma'am? One minute. She'll get some energy. Drink the juice! And you stand right here. - Let's go? - Yes, let's get this over with. Can't you manage this? Do one thing, you see the camera is going to turn in every direction. So you come over here, to the side. That plant over there, can you move it to the left? Move the whole pot... No, no, the left one! Yes, that one. Eat something from the table if you want, okay? The left pot, the small one! And be ready tonight, okay? - Perfect! - It isn't done yet? Almost done. It'll just take a second now. We'll take the portrait. That's it. And ready? Perfect. Done. Come. It's over, you can get up. Now you come, it's your turn. - My turn? - Who else? - Come, come! - Okay, fine. Yes, my child? Is there something you want to say? This... what? I don't understand. If you have something on your mind that is troubling you... speak now... and seek the blessings of the Father. There is something, but I don't know... Fear not, my child. Are you smiling at me? Praise the Lord! Have you ever done a confession? No. You? Just now, for the first time. Kabir, I like you a lot. I only realized now. I really like you too, Jazz. But... do you like me? You love her? Yeah, I love her. Okay. - Thank you. - You're welcome. You should definitely meet him. - He's in your constituency? - He's the head of the minority commission. - Let's go? - Come on. Come. Namaste! Come, my son. - Say hi to Vishal Uncle! - Hello! She never lets go of that doll. - Come, come. - Okay guys, just... You come to this side. - Should I stand here? - Uncle, you can stand here. No, I'll be there, you go to that side. All good? - Okay, are we ready? - Look there. - We have to look there, right? - Yes, ma'am, right here. Sorry, Papa. I really troubled you. It's good that you've quickly understood what is best for you. - What would you like? - I would like whatever you like. I hope you're enjoying the evening. It's a marvelous Qawwali. You have outdone yourself. - Thank you. - Thank you. They've planned the whole thing really well. Hmm. I'm tired. I think I need my beauty sleep now. You look as beautiful, with or without the sleep. Thank you. You'll walk me to my room? Please. Let's go. Ma'am, some eunuchs have come to give their blessings. But the function is still on. - Call them tomorrow. - Okay. Wait a minute, sending them away would be disrespectful, right? - Where have they come from? - The Guru Fateh's shrine. - Guru Fateh's shrine is... - Isn't that Yadav's sir constituency? - It is. Call them. - Okay. But get them in from the back gate, okay? - Okay. - Okay. - Weddings are incomplete without them. - I agree. Do you like it? Yeah, I like it. So... you want to go now? You want me to stay? I can stay. Hmm? We are practically married now. We are not married. It's not right. What's going on over there? Sir, they've come to give you both their blessings. Okay, okay. Yeah, one minute, I... Wait, what... Come on now. It's the bride's turn. Get out. Nutan! Good night! The party leaders, what about them? Sir, actually they'll all be seated along those hedges over there. The seating will be raised for them. Wake up, it's getting late. Nutan? The baraat will come from there so Nutan's Aunt and Uncle can be seated here. Obviously, flower decorations will be done here, you know, from... Nutan is not in her room. - What? - Nutan is not in her room. Do you, John Matthew... take Nutan Yadav... to be your lawfully wedded wife? - I do. - Do you, Nutan Yadav... take John Matthew... to be your lawfully wedded husband? I do. Ma'am, ma'am... Ma'am, is there anything you'd like to say? I have called you all here today to announce that I have married John Matthew. He is the man I love. He's an engineer and I am now Nutan Matthew. My father Brajesh Yadav... was forcing me to get married to Vishal Singh. I am saying all this publicly... so that... if anything happens to us... you know who's done it. If anything happens to me... please know that I haven't committed suicide like my sister. Life is precious. And I'm looking forward to living my life with my husband. Was your sister's death a suicide or murder? Do you think your life is in danger? Do you think your family... How did she leave the house? I'm asking you a question. How did she leave? How dare she! We will do nothing now. Yadavji... listen to me this time. We will do nothing. The media is watching. One wrong step... and you can forget the next election as well. So you've taken on the ruling party, huh? Something like that, yeah. It's actually very brave. I'm trying. About time. I never thought I'd see you again. Uh... You... you're married? Yeah, yeah. Happy. Mundane. You? No, no one. I'm... I'm single. Playing the field is fun, I guess. Cheers. I'm sorry. I'm really, really sorry. I was abused in jail. This cop, he... he just kept putting his fucking dick in my face, so... I'm sorry. I can't believe I hated you for so long. I can't believe I've loved only you. - This is such a fabulous party. - Thanks. What a celebration. - I love these earrings you're wearing! - Happy anniversary. Thank you. To my gorgeous daughter-in-law and my son Adil. A very, very happy anniversary and I wish you have many, many more to come! - Here we go. - Cheers! Varun, do you remember the first time we heard about Tara? - Oh, I remember that. - Please, please. Please let's not tell that story but I do remember the first time that I saw her. Yeah! She was walking in and she was wearing a grey skirt, and a white shirt... and she had hair pulled back really tight. - Yeah. - You have a crazy memory. It was the first time you met him too. Do you remember what he was wearing? - Definitely not. - No? No way, she doesn't remember anything. She doesn't remember what movie we watched last night. We went to this amusement park and she swears that we went on this ride... And now, ladies and gentlemen, give a big round of applause for the emerging entrepreneur of the year. Mr. Adil Khanna! He has taken Khanna Ancillaries to new shores to form Khanna Infrastructure. - Well done. - Thank you. Amazing. And for your information... in the interest of the ladies gathered here... - Mr. Adil Khanna is still single. - Not for long! You remember the time we went to the south of France? - And we visited the vineyards. - I do. I do, indeed... They have this pool in the house... and I don't think I've ever seen him swim. You know what's the best thing about Sabyasachi? He's teamed up with Christian Louboutin and they're coming up... and they have this new collection. Smell and sip. - Swirl. - Yup. - Smell. - Yeah. And sip! That's how you do it. - It's much easier. - That's how you do it! No, it's not the best, but you know, it's the best that he can afford. - It's good, but. - Excuse me. Because it's interesting, I mean you know, you're struggling for three days... I'm sorry. Was that Faiza? No, it was... Jagdish from the office. Really? Are you sure about that? Yes. I'm so sorry, guys. I'll just be back. Can I... - offer you some more wine? - Yes. Kishore, why don't you pour some wine? Why don't you try some fish? Have you lost your fu... What the fuck are you doing? What the fuck is all of this? - What are you doing? - You've been seeing Faiza all along. No, I have not. - Hey... - I know you've been. Don't lie to me, Adil! One second, what are you talking about? What... I know you've been seeing her. I know you've been going to her house all along! You've been fucking lying to my face! I have no idea what you're talking about. You don't? - Not in the fucking slightest. - I have pictures. I have proof. So shut the fuck up. Just... just one sec, one sec, one second. Can you just, one second... Just... please hear me... Listen to me for one second. Okay? I'm sorry. It is really complicated. We... we will... We can talk. I'm really sorry. We can fix this, okay? We can. - We can't fix this, Adil. - Yes, we can. You fucking love her. You love her. You know, you guys fit together better... you know that, I know that. - You love her. - It's not... - I'm the odd one out. - It's not like that. If I loved her, I would have married her! I married you! Please hear me out, come on! Don't... make... a mistake. Don't do something you can't go back from, okay? Don't... Just calm down. You think you've done a fucking favor to me, right? This is just a big favor for you, isn't it? - Picked me up from the gutter... - No! You think you've given me this big ass life so you can do whatever the fuck you want! - No! - And I'm supposed to keep taking it! - I don't feel that at all! - Of course, you feel that! - I do not... - You do something for my sister or my mother, you give them a house and I'm supposed to be your fucking slave! - No! - Adil Khanna, so I'm supposed to listen to you all the fucking time! Who said you have to be a fucking slave? I have no idea what you're talking about! I married you because I love you! - I'm glad that you're here! - You don't... - You make my life better! - Fucking love me. - I can't keep taking your bullshit! - I don't... Don't fucking break things! - I don't fucking think that at all! - I'm talking to you! It's not about Faiza alone, man. This... this marriage is not working! This marriage is... - You fucked up! - Don't say... I fucked up! - Yes, I fucked up... - I cheated. - Wait, what? - We're the same, Adil. One sec, one second! One second, one second! When did you cheat? It's not your fault alone. - Wait, one sec... - We're both responsible for this. - One second, what are you... - It doesn't matter... These things don't matter! Okay. They don't matter. Yeah, I'm sorry. It just, it doesn't matter. Whatever you did, I'm... I thought it'd be perfect, you know... that if I had you... if I had this life... - I'd be happy. - You will be. I'm not. When do you leave? In two days. Keep in touch, Karan. I will. What? You... still sleep like that? What are we going to do? We'll survive. What? Welcome to New Delhi. Insider or outsider... you will find your corner. Because the truth is, you scratch any surface... and it all comes down to the same thing. Hope. Hope for better, hope for holier, hope for happier. Young, old, rich, poor, modern, traditional... in new Delhi... we all wake up wondering if what heaven planned for us will happen today.
