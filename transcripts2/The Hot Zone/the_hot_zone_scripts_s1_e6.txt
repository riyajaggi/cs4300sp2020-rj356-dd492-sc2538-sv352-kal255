 Previously on The Hot Zone... You know how many people would die on this planet if the leftovers of this freezer ever got released? All of us? Well, hello Monkey O-5-3. The cells I saw in that culture weren't just dead. They were exploded. There's only a few things in the world that could do this. A virus like you're suggesting just appears out of nowhere on U.S. soil? Well, there's a first time for everything. Sorry, but why does it have to be you?

 Someone else can do that. Peter's convinced I'm wrong and the colonel thinks that it's too improbable. So who else is there? Don't put too much stock in Nancy's paranoia. Her mentor is like a pathogen chasing wackjob. This guy went off the deep end. Always looking for the big one. Ebola Zaire. It can't be Ebola. Anyone whose suit is compromised will be moved to the slammer for three weeks. Ebola spreads easily through caretakers. Anyone handling blood, feces, vomit. How many workers in your facility fit that description? You need to let me get in there today, make sure that it's contained and

 that it doesn't spread to the other primates. I'm so proud of you. Put up a fight till I get back, okay? Same for you. I found a sick monkey in another cell. What? Evacuate the hallway! I'm Colonel Jaax, U.S. Army. You need to get out of here. Travis Rhodes, CDC, I'll be taking it from here. This isn't a pissing contest. Don't know what happened with you two. But I can't afford to let it influence what I do now. You have no idea what you're getting into. We could be the next victims! Like it or not, the virus is here. We are facing an enemy that can devastate a city. And you're what's standing between it and the civilians outside those doors. It's in that building. It's learning. It's evolved. Right. Your elusive super Ebola. There will be super Ebola. It will wipe us out if we don't get ahead of it. Jerry! What's going on? Colonel's gone down, ma'am. Jerry, can you hear me? Hi. - You shouldn't be here. - The team's exhausted. There's no other backup. I should've been out hours ago. Jerry. Jerry, look at me. Honey. Look... Colonel. What do we do now? We can't call it off, can we? You can ride with us to the hospital. Tell the team I'm coming in. - Yes, ma'am. - Take good care of him. Has anyone seen Carter? I saw him heading down the back hall a while ago. You're doing the cuts now? Dr. Carter said we were capable. I've had two years vet training. And my hands feel wet. But you know that they're clean and safe inside those gloves, right? Do you ever get used to that? Not really. Clean work. Uh... something's happening. Uh, what's, uh... oh, it's deflating, I can't breathe. Give me your extra battery pack, now! I-I forgot to grab a backup. Here. Use mine. They're different. Damn. Keep looking at me. I need an extra pack in dissecting! Get someone on the PA system. Oh my God. Oh my God. We're running out of sedative. Two-Six-Seven? Yes, sir. Got him. Almost there. Any team member, we need a BP-15 battery in dissecting now! You heard him, let's go. Look at me. Look at me. I want you to follow my breathing. Do what I do. Look at me. Not deep breaths. In. Out. That's it. You want to save all that air that's in there. No. No, no, no, no... I have to get out, I have to get out! No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no! I got one. Here it is. - I got you, I got you! - I got to get out... Okay. Okay. It's on. Just breathe. Relax. You're okay. I thought I grabbed the right one, I just, I... Just breathe through it. I want you to decon out. Uh, ma'am? I don't think that's a good idea. We got company. You've got to be kidding. This isn't right. I'm phoning her. No. She's got a job to do. The two of you... I can't decon out, I'm shorthanded as it is. Okay, okay. Well, how soon can you get here? With this weather, 20 minutes. Thanks. Keep the line moving. I'm going to go track down Carter. Yes, ma'am. Carter? You're gonna tear your suit. What the hell are you doing? The monkeys you brought to Hazleton came from this freezer. We'll get to them. Right now, I need you to be the expert I brought in, to make sure my soldiers are doing things correctly. We've got a bigger problem... A bigger problem than a team losing their leader? With Jerry down they need us. - What? - You didn't know? - Is he okay? - They don't know yet. I haven't been gone that long. You've been gone from your station for hours. No, listen to me. How many monkeys did you put in your trunk? Four. Why? There should have nine in the freezer. There's only eight. The manifest from the Philippines said there was 94 animals taken off the plane at Dulles. Only 93 arrived here. So you're saying a monkey disappeared? Between Dulles and this hellhole. So where is it? There could be a monkey out there, spreading a mutating virus across the city. Once the press leaves, I want you to decon out. Yeah, I'll need some backup. The Army has no jurisdiction outside this facility. You know who does. The guy hates my guts. I'm never going to convince him to help. You need to bury whatever happened between you two, Carter. You've got no choice. Listen. They are all gone. I don't know why we're here. We should hear the monkeys. But we hear nothing. A whole family of them, dead. Our spirit will not curse the animals. As you said, my village has a disease of the body. Yeah. That's right. Good. Now, Bosa, you can help me save... You cannot stop it. It's wiser than you or me. You have made difficult choices. You have forced people apart to save other people. Our ancestors have been doing this for generations to keep people away from the disease. Yeah, uh, exactly. And with your help, we will be able to save the rest of... I see now, we cannot stop this. Keep people apart? It's not human nature. So we wait. Some will leave us. But some will stay. Someone will always survive. That's why we are still here. Someone always survives. I've never seen anything like this. It's horrible. Where's Carter? He said he'd meet us here for the chopper. Well, it was supposed to be here an hour ago. Chopper's late! You're late! It's not coming. I called it off for a few more days. You did what? Are you crazy? Well, I don't know how I didn't see it. Bosa opened my eyes. You know when I said faith healers are just superstitions... Because I didn't see the virus for what it is. He does. Now, there's very little we can do to stop this thing. But someone has to survive it. We need to wait until someone pulls through it. And who knows how long that will be? You've let this place get to you. We need to get back, find a way to stop this from ever happening again. We already have the blood samples. All that will do is help us identify it. There must be a survivor. They will have antibodies in their plasma. It's the only chance of a cure. You're going to get us all killed! Hi. Can I help you with something? Depends. Who are you? I'm the supervisor here. My night guard called me, woke me up and told me there was somebody snooping around. You know, there's been a lot of break-ins around here lately, if you're looking for some real news. Neighbors say the real news is right here. Do you have some kind of outbreak? What gave you that idea? Eyewitness accounts of people in hazmat suits climbing around the roof today. I was... trying to keep it quiet from my workers. We've got leaks in the roof and the tiles are asbestos, we brought a special team in. I had them working odd hours because I didn't want anybody freaking out. Do you really expect me to buy that, man? All right. Fine. We did have an outbreak. Simian Hemorrhagic Fever. It's not our first time and it's not going to be our last. And it's not pretty. By all means, I can show you what ten dead monkeys look like. It's pretty bloody. Which you eventually get used to, but the stench... with all the feces and the blood and... the rotting fur... I think I should probably warn you about that part. And I'm not sure how much of that you can show on TV. We're good, they're leaving. Listen up. The press is gone. We can start rotating breaks now. Resume your stations. Keep an eye on your buddy. You stop and rest before you get tired. How many monkeys we have left? About 300, ma'am. Let's finish this. And then we're all going home tomorrow. All of us. I'd like an update on, uh, one of my men. Jerry Jaax. He's lost a lot of fluid. About ten pounds. He arrived severely dehydrated. Yeah, I want to see him. Here, this will work. Oh, it's freezing. Yeah. Oh my God. Look. Oh. Yeah, I see it. W-Wait, there's more. Wait, who dumped syringes here? Oh my God. Colonel Jaax. There's some sort of problem outside. They look like they've been here a while. At first we thought maybe someone was shooting up ketamine or something but... You think maybe someone just missed the dumpster? It's okay. Just stay right there. Don't hurt me. No, no. I'm not going to hurt you. Look, look. Look. See? I'm not going to hurt you. I need you to just stand very, very still. Put your arms out, like an airplane. Yeah, good job. Okay. Good. Now drop that needle. There you go. You're very good at this. What's your name? - Bobby. - Okay, Bobby. I'm going to come in and I'm going to lift you up and blast you off like a rocket, okay? So don't move till I come and get you. Okay. One, two, three... lift off! Good job, Bobby. Good job. Good job. So, this could be spreading to civilians? Six million people in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. You can't pick up a phone? Well, I... I have been in communication with the necessary agencies but... I didn't feel there was a need to sound an alarm. Not at this time. Are you not responsible for the treatment of four individuals who have tested positive for Ebola hemorrhagic fever? Uh... uh, well, yes and no, sir. Well, which is it? Ebola Zaire, we're not sure if that is what it is yet. This could be a new strain. If I could redirect your attention... Is There a cure, Dr. Rhodes? Any kind of treatment? No. And now you're telling me the CDC hasn't quarantined every single person within a mile of this thing? We've taken precautions, but whatever virus we have has produced nothing more than a mild fever and vomiting. If we activate a Regional Disaster Response Team... you're talking about a multiagency coalition under the command of a three-star general. Local military, FEMA, emergency response units. No one's used to talking across channels. You haven't seen a Charlie-Foxtrot like this would be. We would have to isolate and evacuate the President, the VP, and safeguard all essential personnel. Anyone who could flee the city, would, leaving only our most vulnerable populations. Hospitals, nursing homes. Then you have to think about the supermarkets. Food supplies dwindle fast. We could be looking at widespread looting and chaos. Now we're talking martial law. So, before all of that gets triggered over a fever, I would like to wait one more day. Just to be sure of what we're really dealing with. Fine. But if one more person tests positive, we will enact a full-scale response. Did they tear you a new one? Tarnish that reputation of yours? A reputation is what allows you to be taken seriously in the world. Doesn't help when they think you're a nut-job. You earned your stripes as a reckless nut-job without any help from me. There's a monkey missing. Blood drawn? Yep. He's ready for the great beyond. You okay? Only a few rooms left, right? Hey Reese, I need some help at Cell J. Yeah, on my way. T rid of the sick ones. The one you are asking about was in bad shape. That's why it was removed from the shipment. How'd the monkey look? Uh, something in the eyes, I guess. The eyes? Yeah, they were red. The mouth, too. Like its gums were bleeding. And how did you dispose of it? Same way we did all the others. What others? Uh, 'bout a dozen died in transit from Manila. Not unusual to lose one or two. The flights are long. Care's not great. But it's-it's okay, you know, we got the new shipment in to replace them. What new shipment? From Manila, few days ago, uh, the company's backlogged or something, they can't pick 'em up for some reason. And they're headed to Reston? Uh, 'bout half, same as the first shipment. The rest are going to Texas. Texas? Yeah, there's a research facility that's expecting them. CARTER: Where are the monkeys now? We need to stop them. We may need to call in more backup to lock this place down. Let's see what we're dealing with. Okay. I'm back, little guy. Reese. Hold still. I got it. Hold her steady. - Oh my God... - Stay calm, we got it. Okay. Is it torn? Am I infected? No tears. No tears. Good work, Lieutenant. Good work. Good work. Even breaths. Good. Good. All right, team, that's the last one. Good work. Let's begin cleanup protocol. Remember what the colonel said, every surface gets wiped. Protect your suits. For the next few days, this'll be the only place on Earth that has nothing living inside of it. And then a spore, a germ... something'll find its way back inside. I can't tell you how impressed I am by all of you. And truly grateful. The whole world should know that you put your lives on the line in there. But I'm afraid no one will ever know what you did. Well, you will. What's wrong? Jerry? My dad, he's gone. Well, we got the sick ones out just in time. That was close. Couple more hours, they'd have been on their way across country. Who knows where the virus could have spread from there. I hate to admit it, but... you were right. Everyone else missed this. You saw it. There's been plenty of times I didn't find anything. Yeah, but you keep looking. I may not agree with your decisions, but... I've always respected that. Your tenacity. Bullheadedness. You found your monster this time. I still think I'm thousands of miles away from finding any real answers. Where has it been hiding all this time? Where did it originate? Bosa. We found a survivor. There's a young girl. Her fever's coming down. Will you use her blood? Yes. We will. We'll give her antibodies to others. Maybe find a cure. My daughter. She refuses to say good-bye to me, but I'm grateful. I do not think I could bear it. How are you feeling? My body does not feel like it's mine... I think perhaps it never was. What do you believe? I'm not a philosopher. My friend... at the end, we are all philosophers. You must listen. I do not have long. Men, women, children... they will come, Carter, from every village, more than we can count. To pay their respects... They will expect to touch this body. They take disease back to their villages. I can talk to them. Explain how a virus spreads. If you believe your words, the words of a stranger, will keep people from following their tradition, you have learned nothing in Africa. Well, maybe you could warn them. There is not time. You must help me. You have medicine, yes? Our medicine's not working. It is not to cure me. The message has already spread that I am sick. If we wait for me to die, the people will be here by then. I will have... no one to die because of me. Look, I'm sorry, I can't. There's no one else. You and I, we will end this together. Please, my friend. I can't. I can't. It would have meant something to her... that someone was there. That someone was with her boy till the very end. I, um, I need the Hydrocodone. There's, uh, three vials in my bag. I checked your bag, it's all gone. What did you do? I made rounds this afternoon. Bosa wasn't that far gone. Carter? We should go. What did you drag me into? Take the girl who survived to Kinshasa. Collect her plasma, pull the antibodies and go home. Let's go. Come on. It wasn't your place... not to take a life! He was already lost. You know that. He was in pain. He made the choice. I won't cover this up for you! You'll have to answer for it! That's correct, Mr. Chairman. But four people tested positive for the Ebola virus. And 172 people were tested and came up negative. Is that right? An employee at an international airport tested positive for Ebola antibodies, for God's sake. The man was asymptomatic. And even the Hazleton employees who exhibited fever, et cetera, most likely just had the flu, not Ebola Zaire. This strain burns through monkeys, but it hasn't been fatal to humans. But if it had been Ebola Zaire, it could have killed countless people in D.C., hitched a ride on our highways and landed in neighborhoods all across the states. Looking at Reston as some sort of failure on the part of the virus ignores the extraordinary leap the virus has made. Only an idiot would think that this fight is over. Ebola is evolving... and strengthening while we sit here and... Dr. Carter. I think we can all agree that we dodged a bullet here. If there are no further questions... We didn't dodge a bullet. We didn't dodge a bullet. The bullet hit us. I think we should hear what they have to say. This strain is so similar to Ebola Zaire. A small change we don't understand in a genetic code we can't comprehend. It's maybe all that saved us, but we won't be that lucky forever. And you know who gets it first? Caregivers. A nurse spreads it from one patient to the next. And when she falls ill, her husband or her daughter tends to her. The Ebola virus spreads when we show each other love, kindness, affection. When we're most human. We have to stop reacting to virus outbreaks after they flare up, and instead plan for it, because there will be another Ebola outbreak and we are not prepared. Protocols have to be put in place using the procedures we tested at Reston. And it's no secret the CDC needs more funding for research and development. We do need stronger surveillance networks, and we need to partner with other countries around the world to stay in front of another outbreak. This outbreak was a warning. We can choose to ignore it, or we can face the future with eyes wide open. There is a deadly pathogen coming for us. What are we going to do about it? Nice work in there. You think it's enough? Has to be. We need to be everywhere on the frontlines protecting ourselves. You know one of the problems with having such a smart student? There comes a day when the teacher realizes he's got nothing left to give. You know how that makes me feel? - Proud? - Useless. I'm going back to Africa. These monkeys came from the Philippines, Ebola doesn't. It has to have originated in Africa. I guess you were never really cut out for a classroom, Carter. Or walls in general. Well, somebody's got to find the source of this strain. So, you're back in the game. You pulled me off the bench. What about you? I'm going home. Hey. Hey. Uh, can I show you something? Sure. Uh, I've been making some notes and doing some sketches. You start looking at this place a little differently, when you think it might be the last place you're ever gonna see. This the lab? Yeah. It's one we should build. Everything I ever learned, it's... I put it right in there. It's pretty genius. And you know how much it kills me to say that to you. Look, it'll take forever to fund and to build, but I figure if we start now... yeah, we can be prepared for the next time. There will be a next time. Everyone understands that, don't they? The Army and the CDC have never downgraded the status of the Ebola Reston virus. It remains a Level 4 hot agent today. The emergence of HIV, Ebola, and any number of hot agents appears to be a natural consequence... Of humanity encroaching on previously undisturbed environments. You might say the Earth's immune system has recognized the presence of its most destructive pathogen. Humans. Emerging viruses continue to mutate and survive, even when faced with the destruction of their natural environment. And when they return, they're stronger than they were before. These monkey traders, they just dump them here? The sick ones. Yes. Marburg, HIV, Ebola... all mingling. It's hell on earth just waiting to get out. What do you call this place? The Isle of Plagues. As we deforest these viruses' homes, wipe out their reservoir hosts, they need a new one to spill over into. Us. Viruses have been around for billions of years because they're smart. The Ebola virus feeds, and then it retreats back into the shadows. Where it learns, mutates. Believe me when I tell you... this Monster will be back again. And we need to be ready.
