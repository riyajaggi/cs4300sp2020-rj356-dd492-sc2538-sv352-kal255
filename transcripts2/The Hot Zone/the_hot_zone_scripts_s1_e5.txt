 Previously on The Hot Zone... What we're dealing with could be worse than anything we've ever seen. We do have a team here. My team. I mean, I just finished handpicking the best crew to go in and I haven't even briefed them yet. The reason Ebola Zaire is classified as a BL4 agent is there's no vaccine. No treatment. We are facing an enemy that can devastate a city. And you're what's standing between it and the civilians outside those doors. Nancy should never have brought Carter in.

 If you put me in charge instead of Nancy... Don't get me wrong, Jerry. Nancy's one of the best we've ever had come through here. But she hitched herself to the wrong horse on this one. I told you how much I didn't want you going in there. I know these pathogens, Jerry! Probably more than anybody else. This is the day I've been trained for! I'm the one who's expendable. I'm going in with Jerry. Job's got to get done. It's not personal. Oh, like hell it isn't. Somebody's going to get the monster. If you find your heart start to race, just breathe it through.

 Carter light. It's okay, it's okay. Find a new one. We need to draw blood from all the workers and whoever they were in physical contact with now. I can have them tested tonight. I can station someone outside the building, but we need to be careful. The press sniffing around, they're going to start asking questions. You're going into combat against a virus for whom survival is all that matters. You guys think the same way and we all come home. All right, listen up. This location's been abandoned for 34 hours. Animals in there are hungry. Expect a violent reaction. Little guys don't like the suits. And let's not forget, these are not hostile enemies. Just primates who got involved in something they did not ask for. They have the same goal we do... To survive. Just like Ebola. Except it's smarter and better at it than we are. What's our ETA? - About an hour. - Good. We need to get in and get out before anyone knows we're there. ♪ He went and sung away ♪ ♪ I open my window without ♪ ♪ Bells were ringing and start the day with a song ♪ ♪ If you imagine the music so real ♪ USAMRIID command. Hey, it's Dixon... get word to the convoy. Abort, a-abort. Someone's snooping around. Highway's just two blocks up. 91-Tango Abort. Got word from Dixon. Someone is on the premises. This is Colonel Jaax. Why didn't he radio us directly? It's possible Reston is out of range, sir. Checking with ASE Ops now. This isn't something we wait on. It's been stalled too long already. Express orders to avoid exposure. Not stir up any public panic. Nancy understands the urgency... I am in command of this mission. You're going to do right by Nancy and honor that. She vouched for you. Every move you make is on her. - Colonel, do we abort? - No, not yet. Dixon, what's your status? Hi. I'm from the Post. Do you know anything about an outbreak here? I promise I won't reveal my sources... Uh, no, I-I'm just the night guy. Just keep an eye on the place. Really. You sure you haven't seen anything? Nothing strange at all? No, all quiet. As usual. Hey, you jumped out of your car pretty quickly, bolted over here. Dixon. Who you on the phone with? My girlfriend. Dixon. She always wants me to check in... She'd kill me if she heard another woman's voice on the end of this line. Status update. He's not responding sir, standby. If you see anything, call me. Don't freeze out here. Dixon, respond. What the hell is going on? Just, just hang on a second. Colonel, do we abort? Pass this on-ramp. Wait for the next. Go to the next one. This has to happen, sooner rather than later. Sooner is safer for everyone. I say we wait. Hold on. We're good, she's leaving. All clear to proceed, sir. Reporter has left the premises. Roger that. Bosa was right. Isolation is the only thing that stops this thing spreading. How does a virus like this just come out of nowhere? It wasn't nowhere. There's been viruses in pigs, bats, monkeys, for thousands of years. But when you cut down their homes and they die off, the monsters got to hide somewhere. Monster? You ever seen anything destroy a body like this? It's the perfect killer. But its Achilles' heel may be it burns through people so fast it snuffs itself out. If this thing ever evolves to live in a human longer before it attacks the body, it could spread faster than we could ever keep up with. Upstead. Your anesthesiology code 2. Upstead again anesthesiology code 2. Okay. Roll up your sleeves. Is my husband going to die? Mrs. Domanski... 'Cause I've been hearing things and I have three kids... and Bruce and I have had our ups and downs but I... I can't imagine going through all of this without him... How old are your kids? They're, uh, 17, 14 and nine. They must be scared... Just be there for them and know that we're here for your husband. He-he's steady. He hasn't spiked a fever. Would you excuse me? Nurse, could I give you that? Could you file that? Thank you. We need to do a wider sweep. There's no telling how many people the workers had contact with before we got them here. We need to see if any are even infected before we go wider. Besides, we have a ticking clock on how long we can even ask these people to stay. How many have shown symptoms? None. Zero symptoms. Run your tests, but if you're looking for an outbreak, you're not gonna find it here. You got to be kidding me. Wasn't someone supposed to close the playground? It's too late now. Sir! Lieutenant Dixon, sir. They had me at the front. Thanks for keeping an eye out, Dixon. I know I haven't had the full briefing, but I've had some experience in Racals. I really want to get in there with my team. Understood. But the whole team's gotta work as a unit. Everyone's assigned already. We do need you on the other side this time. Ah man... Uh, yes, sir. Let's step it up. We need to take these into BL4. Are those from the hospital? Yeah... blood samples we need to test. All contacts and immediate family members. When was the last time you two slept? Uh, we've been taking shifts. Problem is, the office chairs aren't really that comfy. It's hard to keep the mind from racing. - And the anxiety? - Well, work helps. Problem is, we're at a standstill. There's nothing in from Reston. - No deliveries yet? - Some kind of delay. I don't know, they haven't even entered the building. We've got to get in there. We need to know what's going on with this thing. Something's off... the symptoms. Have you tested yourselves today? I mean, yeah, we were going to but... It's like, we got thousands of animal samples incoming, plus all this blood that you're bringing in... We didn't think there was going to be time. Yeah, well, you need to make the time. Look, I know this is scary but you need to do it before we go in there. - Yeah. - I'm going to suit up. How many of us do you think have it? Guess we'll know soon. Your dad ever worry something like this would happen? Naw, he just liked taking care of the animals. Said each one had a funny quirk if you looked for it. Thanks... All right, guys, listen up. This will be our sally port here. You come through here once you've deconned out. We'll tape off a portion of the hallway for our grey zone. Our buffer to the outside world. We're on the radar of the press and we got neighbors... lot of eyes on us, so no one comes out of this facility in a suit. Inside, heating is still malfunctioning. Expecting issues with the electrical, so... We'll go by flashlight. Can't use headlamps with the hoods, so we'll drop lanterns along the way, two in every room. The first team will be sedation, stationed one in every cell until each animal has been removed. Next, we'll set up the dissection team here. Carter will supervise this room. They're coming fast. 500 by the end, but you just concentrate on the one in front of you. After we take blood samples, each animal will be brought to the euthanization station. After they're put to sleep, we take tissue samples. There'll be a a lot of blood. Infected blood. If you get any on your suit, stop what you're doing, and wipe it off with bleach. The virus isn't like HIV. Once it hits the air, it can stay active for days. We'll suit up to go into the building now. The whole place might be hot until we can secure this grey zone. If you need to get out for any reason, we'll get you out. Any questions? Make sure the tape is on tight. Cover very seal. Okay. We're now leaving the Sally Port, and entering the Grey Zone. 14-1-4. Keep me at them. This is the buffer. Nothing hot comes in here. We'll need to sterilize as well. ♪ This ain't so good to be ♪ ♪ To me ♪ ♪ I love the way it rhymes ♪ We'll set up Decon through here. ♪ Right on time ♪ ♪ You're singing my song ♪ ♪ You're singing so good ♪ ♪ Right on cue ♪ ♪ You're singing my song ♪♪ All right, heads up. Beyond this door is the Hot Zone. Once you pass into the Hot Zone, your suits will be contaminated. When you're heading out, after Decon, bag them and burn them. Okay? Get the equipment in. We need to sheet this doorway. Yes, sir! ♪ Keep you singing my song ♪♪ Trying the breaker. Nope. We blew it out. All we have are the emergency lights. Okay, let's get some lights set up and start unloading those coolers. Roger that. That's a 2-20. Are some of these empty? You're okay. You're okay. Oh, hell no. Did one of them throw that at you? Well, I didn't throw it at myself. They're using whatever means they have to express distress. Every smear is hot as can be. No one touch it. And bleach that off your suit. I'm going go with everything is hot and don't touch anything. The more we react, the more they'll continue. So, stay calm. All right, guys. Go get the sedation equipment. Lot of these animals are exhibiting violent behavior. Acute awareness of their surroundings. They're healthy, some of them. If you were thinking of saving any of these, forget it. These aren't humans. They're monkeys. My job is to not see the difference. Look, you're coming from a good place. But we don't have the time to differentiate between those infected and those who aren't... Everyone of one of them could have it. - I've got one. - You sure? I don't like what I'm seeing over here either. Two new cases. Christ. We've got to alert Reston. We should test the rest. See how many infections we have in total. I got to call the hospital. This is Jaax, get me Rhodes. Nurses station west, please call OCU. Nurses station west, please call OCU. Hello. Uh-huh. Okay. No, no. Okay. We have to go down tests. No, no. Just wait here. They're laying sticks down. There's two more families infected. We're being shunned, just like the family. Hey, we need those rags! It's time. The baby's coming. You going to lend a hand? That's exactly what it wants you to do. Expose yourself, get close. The woman and baby are lost. They're all lost. Tell her she has to try and slow her breathing down. Tell her to take deep breathes. All right, she's hemorrhaging. She's crowning. It's time. Tell her she has to push. You have to push. Okay? That's it! That's it! Deep breathes and push hard! You can do it! You can do it. Come on! Come on! One big push. That's it. That's good, that's good. Come on. That's good, breathe. Breathe. Breathe. One last push. One last big push. That's it. Come on! Gordy. Could I have a word? Uh, and-and Janice. It's okay. It's going to be okay. We got the whole parish praying for us. Your dad has you this week, so... you should call him, tell him about the files in the closet. Mom...? Just tell him. Nothing's going to happen. Maybe not. But just in case... I love you. Proceed to hotel tango. All right, sedation team, listen up. Sergeant Ericson is your lead. He'll monitor breaks. This is gonna be a long day. Mandatory 15 minutes every 45. Never forget your buddy. Remember, you're not one, you're two. The first person to the cage will open it, making sure that there's no obstruction. The second one will position the pole... - You got it? - Yeah. So that as soon as the door is open you've got it right there to prevent any chance of escape. Sedated monkeys will be transported to the euthanizing station. All right, let's clear this up! So, We have a good work surface here! Now, we don't know a lot about this virus. How it's spreading in here, how it's ravaging the body. But we get samples, and maybe these guys will help us stop this thing next time. Maybe we can help us find the cure. We'll take any blood samples here while the heart is still pumping, and then we'll inject the euthanizing agent over here. After that, they're taken here for dissection. End of the line. We need up to five samples from each. Each tagged and labeled per monkey. When we're done, we triple-bag each body. Prepare it for incineration. We bleach every surface. Prime the drains with a couple of gallons, then every time blood goes down, follow it with another jug. Bring in your syringe pole. I know it's already hot in here, but trust me: it's going to get worse. So, pace yourself. Easy, easy... Got it! I never knew you to be one to watch the time down here. Jerry said he'd check in. Look, I'm sure everything's fine. It's the first batch from Reston, "samples from a dozen monkeys." Whoa. I'm starting to think that Carter had a point. So did Rhodes. There's something very different about this Ebola virus. It glowed. There's no way this could be happening to these monkeys, and no human's shown more than a fever. Four positive cases and headaches, no vomiting, no hemorrhaging? Someone along the way would have gotten sick... could be that nobody's sick because the incubation time is longer. Spreading to a lot of people before any symptoms appear. Hey. You're exhausted. Go. I'll clean up. Okay? I'll just be a few minutes. Okay. Thank you. Thanks. I'll be right behind you. Doesn't look like it's moving much. No. I don't see it moving. - Get it! - He's getting away! Sarah, we need to get this one down first. Let me inject it! No, We have to... Why the hell did they put two in one cage? We're going to need more tags out of the truck. Shut the door! What?! Going for the door! Shut the door! Colonel, one escaped! Cover the exits. We've got a rogue! Yes, sir. - Are you all right? - Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. - Orman. - What? Is this from a monkey or is that your blood? No, it must be from one of the samples or... Routing before air lock. Secondary hatch. Peter! Wake up, you've got to get out of here. Come on. I can't lose anyone else go. Especially not you. - Wait, anybody else? - We've got incoming. - A breach at Reston? - I don't know. All I know is they're coming in and they're going to the Slammer. You okay? Look at me. - I'm okay. - Both in D gone. Bravo ten, stick with me. Dixon. We have an escaped monkey. It might be going for the vents. Get up on the roof. Uh... c-copy that. It's all right, get back! Stay still! We can't let it out, there's houses across the street and a playground. Wichita, get to the roof! Yes, sir! It's on the move! Come on! Keep your flashlights to the ceiling! This thing is quick! Come on! Heads up! Give out a shout if you see him! Yeah, I got him! Hey! Where is it? I don't know. All I know is a monkey escaped. It's right there! Look. There's an open vent. There he is! I can't jab him from here. He's on the move! It's headed for the shaft. Southwest side. There! Go, go, go! You got it!? Stand down on the roof. We got him. - Goddamn it. - Vitals are okay. Blood pressure is rising. All right. And find anyone to notify. I don't know what happened. I was being so careful. It's okay. Everyone here's going to look after you. 21 days? That's what they said. Can't think like that. Stay present. There's not even a magazine. They clean this place up good... Nothing to off myself with. What did I say? Get out of your head. What's going on in the facility? I thought this, this taking out those monkeys, it'd be like a hard day at vet school... But their eyes... it is like looking into another person... It's crazy in there. Dark. Heat is all whacked out. Everyone is exhausted. It's messed up. Listen to me, Kyle. I'm going to come back and check up on you every day, but if it gets unbearable in there, I need you to breathe through it. Like I taught you. Okay? Just breathe through it. I'll be back. 91-Tango Unit. This is Colonel Jaax. Hi. It's good to hear your voice. We were late going in. I heard. Listen, Jerry... I tested the rest of the workers' blood. We've got two new cases. Okay... well, uh, that's not unexpected is it? No. But we just don't know who had direct exposure through fluids so... Okay, we'll be careful. Thanks for the heads up. I, uh, I got to get in there. Hey, Jerry. You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I, uh, I gotta go. Sir? Permission to join the team in Reston. Thought you and the Colonel had already been through this, Nancy. Yes, sir, but he isn't here. 91-Tangos are outperforming expectations but they need relief. One of Jerry's key team members is now in the Slammer. And as you said so yourself, Carter is my charge. Only right that I'd be in there to watch him. How long have you had a fever? Just a day or two, but there's a flu going around my kid's school, so... Yeah, well, it's flu season, so... What about you? How you feeling? I don't know. It kind of feels like they keep turning on the A/C down here. I mean, our tests, they came back... Yeah, they're negative but... this thing's acting different. I mean, it's... it's slow to show symptoms. I don't know... Feel like I am going to crack up. I don't know how my mom did it. She found out she had cancer. She knew there was no hope. Knew it for what? Eight, ten months. And for us it's been, what? A little over two days. I think it's 'cause we're locked down here, but... my thoughts have been getting pretty dark, man. I mean, I'm a scientist, I should know better but... do you think people know when they're sick? You know, like, deep down? On some level? I don't know, maybe it's something the body does. Kind of prepares you, so when the doctor walks in and he says, "You know, it's all over," you don't totally freak out. Because on some level, you already know the truth. I don't know what to believe. My oldest, he, um, he wants to start basketball. I played all throughout high school. My dad never missed a game. I never should've made you smell it. You didn't make me. Ben, if anything happens... I'm so sorry. I know. Any of the other have been all soup, like this guy? Not that I've seen. More mush than soup. What cell is it from? Cell K. Why? Bag those samples and move on. You're leaving? I got to check something. Take over, you'll be fine. Okay. That's your third battery, sir. Sir, we've been going at this for 12 hours. Rest of us have been breaking every 45 minutes... You need one, too. The faster I get through these the fewer infected animals we're handling. But you're right. We have been in here too long. Have everybody get some food. Get them out of their suits. Yes, sir, but if you're staying, I'm staying. I'm not leaving you here alone.

And they got this barbecue chicken tender thing... so good. We should grab a bite. Right, Colonel? Jerry! Colonel down! Colonel down! Colonel? Still conscious, breathing. No time to decon. Get a van ready. We're crashing him out. Affirmative, med vac en route. Colonel? What's going on? Is someone, someone injured? Colonel's gone down, Ma'am. I'm coming in. Let's finish this. Carter? What are you doing? We've got a problem. Something's happening! No, no, no, no, no! Who dumped syringes here? - We got company. - You got to be kidding. There could be a monkey out there spreading a virus across the city. We could be looking at widespread looting and chaos. What did you do? What did you drag me into? The Hot Zone. The dramatic conclusion next. On National Geographic. Captioned by Cotter Captioning Services.
