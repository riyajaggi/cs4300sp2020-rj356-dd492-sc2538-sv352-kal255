 - Previously on "The Bold Type"...
 - I'm gonna ask for that sabbatical.
 - This is great. We're gonna be great.
 - We're so lucky to be alive in a time where we're making
 such incredible strides forward as a community.
 - This is your ship.
 You do not need me to run it with you.
 - We were doing this together.
 - You can't mess up like this again,
 'cause I'm giving you my heart
 and I really don't want you to break it.
 - I love you, too, Sloan. - I know.
 - You do have a gene mutation that increases your risk
 of getting breast cancer over the course of your life.
 [machine whirring]
 - [exhales slowly]
 - I'll guide you through everything.
 It's pretty quick.
 - Sorry. I'm just a little new at this.
 - Well, you'll get used to it.
 It's like your first bra or tampon.
 Just another thing we women have to do.
 Those two plates are gonna compress and hold your breast
 so that we can get a clear picture, okay?
 Just lean forward and hold.
 [machine whirring]
 - Is that machine gonna squish Jane's breast like a pancake?
 - Okay, there's no way a woman invented that machine.
 - Yeah, I want to see how guys get their balls scanned.
 [electronic music]
 - Sorry. Uh, I know you had to bend a lot of rules
 to get them in here, but they're like my family.
 ♪
 - You're doing great, Jane. - We love you.
 ♪
 - Try to relax.
 - ♪ I want to be your sister ♪
 [machine whirring] ♪ Till the end
 - Oh, my God. That looks painful.
 - Ah!
 - ♪ Do you want to be mine?
 ♪
 - I'm really sorry I lost it there at the end.
 - [chuckles] It's fine.
 but, uh, next time you go to the gyno,
 I'm coming. - Yes.
 - [chuckles]
 Um, so do I go out front or just wait here
 to get my results?
 - We'll call you within 24 hours.
 - Oh, I-I, um--I just thought that normally people
 get their results right away.
 - Dr. Braun isn't in till tomorrow.
 So take your time, and you can leave when you're ready.
 - So what do you want to do tonight?
 - I want to go out. - Out.
 Let's go out. - Mm.
 - Let's get litty!
 Guys, I know the perfect place.
 It just opened, like, two weeks ago,
 but we got to dress up.

 - Tell 'em.
 - "Scarlet" digital is going to be a very different beast.
 Faster turnarounds, shorter pieces,
 more writer POVs.
 Also, we have room for verticals now.
 The written content is not the only thing that's changing.
 We're gonna have "Scarlet" podcasts.
 We have our own video channel.
 A TV studio is being set up out front.
 - Well, we could get a personality
 to take to the streets.
 I was thinking maybe Andrew in drag
 could conduct some interviews. - Andrew, my assistant?
 - Yeah. We--we saw him at a show recently,
 and it was so good, and online personalities
 are a big thing for digital magazines.
 - Oh, that would be different, yes.
 A lot is going to change around here,
 but there is one thing that I want to keep
 that is iconic to "Scarlet,"
 and that is the magazine cover and cover shoot.
 - [laughs] Thank God.
 - Our first cover really needs to capture who we are.
 - Jacqueline, I'm sorry. I have, uh, Ian on the line.
 - Oh, uh, let's reconvene in a bit.

 and I need you to get back home early for Connor's tutor.
 Right? - Yeah.
 Um, Ian, it's really not a good time for me
 to be leaving the office early.
 - Honey, I thought we said that we would share the load.

 - Okay, I'll figure it out.
 [line clicks, dial tone buzzing]

 - What's with the new digs? - Um, these are my old digs.
 Since Patrick's gone,
 I asked Jacqueline if I could have my old desk back,
 and she said yes.
 I'm so excited--do you know how long I've been waiting
 for my own vertical? - I do.
 It's why you took the job from me at "Incite."

 Well, that didn't go very well, did it?
 - Well, you got media trained, which might come in handy
 now that we're getting a "Scarlet" channel.

 - Remember when RJ thought that Latinx was a nightclub?
 - How could I forget?
 - Or when you had to explain transitioning to him
 so you could put Laverne Cox on the cover?
 - That was such a great cover. - [laughs]
 They all were.

 My almond butter's missing, and it's a problem.
 - Not a huge problem, relatively.
 - What's wrong?
 - RJ denied my request for a sabbatical.
 - Why? He's given sabbaticals
 to people who've worked here half as long as you.
 - Apparently they've changed their policy.
 I can still go, but I would have to quit Safford.
 - Oh, wow.
 I thought this was gonna be more of, like,
 a trial thing, see how it goes.
 - If you don't think it's a good idea--
 - No, no, no, I'm the one that encouraged you to do this.
 I mean, it's what you really want to do, right?

 - Listen up, people.
 I want our first digital cover to be a stylized collection

 Jane, Alex, reach out to Pam Sheard,
 the woman who founded the magazine.
 She's from a different era
 and has a ton of fun, old "Scarlet" stories.
 Oliver, why don't we do a fashion retrospective
 that covers six decades?
 And, Kat, I want to revisit celebrities
 that we interviewed before they were famous.
 Let's get video testimonials from America Ferrera,
 Kerry Washington, Bella Diaz.
 - Oh, um, I don't really know if Bella Diaz is the right fit,
 but there are other people that I--
 - I like her, and she's coming out with a new album,
 so the timing is good.
 Now, in here,
 we have "Scarlet" magazines
 dating back to 1972.
 So be careful with them,
 but all of you should feel free to dig in
 and get inspired.

 - Okay, these old issues are incredible.
 Do you remember the, uh, confessions page
 where people had to write in their deepest, darkest secrets?
 - I have a confession.
 I don't know why I told Richard to move to San Francisco.
 I mean, who does that?
 Who tells the love of their life
 to move across the country for good?
 - It's not for good. It's for a sabbatical.
 - They don't give sabbaticals anymore,
 so Richard has to quit his job.
 - Richard's leaving Safford? - It's gonna be fine.
 I just have to focus on the time that we have left
 and accept that we are changing,
 like "Scarlet" and fashion.
 - Yeah, and fashion always comes back.
 You know, motorcycle jackets, ripped jeans, these.
 - Okay, Ozzy. - Mm.
 - It's all coming back. Richard will come back, too.
 - Yep, everything's back.
 - Now, when you say it like that...
 - I thought that you were excited
 about taking on digital.
 - Yeah, except we're not taking it on.
 We're looking back.
 And you know what? I don't want to look back.
 I don't want to look back
 at how I didn't advocate for Bella Diaz.
 - What?
 - We actually met, like, five years ago,
 when I was an assistant at this shoot,
 and for some reason, she trusted me,
 and she actually came out to me
 and asked if I'd help her come out in the magazine.
 - Wow. - Yeah.
 Before I could do anything, her manager came to me.
 He told me not to.
 Said it would ruin her career.
 Um...
 So I just said nothing.
 And she never came out.
 - That's heavy,
 but you can't put that on yourself.
 - Yeah, that's--that's not your fault.
 - And I'm sure that Bella's okay.
 - Yeah, well, we'll find out, I guess.

 And now a few words from some "Scarlet" friends.
 - Hi, "Scarlet."
 Billie Jean King here.
 In 1981, I was outted
 and forced to make a difficult decision
 that put my professional tennis career at risk.
 But then the phone rang. It was "Scarlet."
 [cheers and applause]
 - The boardroom's available. Everyone's here.
 - Are you serious? - Yeah.
 We just have to find our window.
 - This is amazing. You're so with the time, huh?
 But honestly, I wanted to talk
 about the magazine for a little bit,
 because as a teenager, it meant so much to me.
 - Ready? - Yeah.
 - Hi, "Scarlet," this is Margaret Cho.
 I want to say thank you so much for showing me
 that my vagina is normal.
 Thank you so much, "Scarlet."
