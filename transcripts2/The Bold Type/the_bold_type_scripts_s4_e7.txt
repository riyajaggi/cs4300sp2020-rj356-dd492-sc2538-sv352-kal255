 - Previously on "The Bold Type"...
 - Make yourself more promotable.
 - Get a bunch of Instagram followers.
 - A fashion influencer?
 - Sutton Brady, Fashion Influencer!
 - I found out that I'm positive
 for the BRCA gene mutation.
 - If you have a mutation,
 your lifetime chance of getting breast cancer
 jumps to 80%.
 - Your "vagenda" speech
 caught the attention of "Forbes" magazine.
 They are nominating you as a possible candidate
 for their "30 Under 30" issue.
 - Ian and I are hitting some bumps,
 and while he's away, we're separating.
 "Scarlet" offered me a job
 as their new in-house photographer,
 and I said yes.
 - I think you look beautiful. How do you feel?
 - Powerful. I had sex with a dude.
 We connected.
 I've never had that with a guy before.
 - It's like you said, you're a lover of people.
 - Maybe it's more than that.
 I might be bisexual?

 - [giggles] Did you finish your run already?
 - I hate being in bed without you, so yes.
 Also, the sunrises here
 are amazing.
 - You're really loving it, aren't you?
 - Feels pretty good helping out
 all these green tech startups.
 How's work for you?
 - Ooh, it's good.
 You know, I'm not saving the world like you, but--
 [laughs] I'm trying.
 I really miss you.
 - I know I'm not there,
 but video chatting really helps, right?
 I feel like--
 - I'm pressed up against you
 and it's so hot.
 - Uh-huh.
 [both moan]
 - Wait, move the camera back a bit.
 I wanna see your eyes.
 - Um... - I wanna see you.

 - Kat, what's happened? Kat?

 - So, Ms. Sloan, as a candidate
 for "Forbes" "30 Under 30,"
 what would you say has been your greatest accomplishment?
 - Taking down Pamela Dolan was certainly a high,
 but pulling back the curtain on the wellness industry
 clearly struck a chord,
 so I guess it's hard to choose just one.
 - So good. [laughs]
 - You're gonna crush your phone interview today.
 - And you are going to crush prepping your book pitches.
 - I hope so.
 I just really can't stand
 the idea of being a one-hit wonder.
 Uh, this is where you say,
 "Babe, you could never be a one-hit wonder.
 You're brilliant."

 It's good to hear your voice.
 - Yeah, you, too.
 - Um, did you-- - Um, how are--
 [chuckles]
 - Okay, you go first. [chuckles]
 - How are you doing?
 - Good. Um...
 The South was bleak,
 but I was exposing the darkness,
 so it had its purpose.
 Plus you can't beat Southern food.
 And you?
 - Uh, you know, I'm good.
 Just saving the world one cause at a time.
 - [chuckles] Classic Kat.
 - Classic me.
 - I was calling because I'm returning to "Scarlet" today.
 - Today. Wow.
 - Yeah, Jacqueline assigned me the feature
 on honoring modern cultural fashions and their impact.
 It's, um--it's a cool idea.
 Photographing women from different places
 in their authentic styles.
 - Yeah, it is.
 You're perfect for it.
 - [sighs] Thank you.
 So I, uh, guess I will see you at the office.
 - Yeah, okay.
 Or, um...
 - I don't know, if you want to meet before,
 I'm in the lobby now.
 Maybe we could get a coffee or something?
 Set some ground rules for working together.

 Oh, and Alice Knight signed on this morning.
 She's a-- - A beauty influencer.
 Her cheekbone highlighting tutorial
 literally saved my life.
 - Well, apparently, she also has over 2 million followers.
 So she's kind of an important get for us.
 - Well, Instagram is powerful.
 But, so is "Scarlet" and this
 brilliant shoot that you came up with.
 - Never stop paying me compliments.
 - You're very smart.
 Very handsome.
 - Thank you. - Hey.
 You should be in this shoot.
 - Oh--stop it. - I'm serious.
 Pay homage to your Jamaican roots.
 - It would be a proud moment for my grandmother.

 - Hey. - Hey.
 - Hey, ladies. - Ooh, Jane, where are you?
 The alabaster, the overhead lighting, what's happening?
 - Wait, is that a hospital gown?
 - Before you freak out, um,
 I'm at the doctor's office. I...
 found a lump in my breast this morning.
 So, I just had an ultrasound,
 and I'm waiting for the results.
 - Okay, I'm-- I'm calling an Uber.
 - And I'm gonna go to Duane Reade and get candy.
 - No, it's fine, uh, the doctor's here.
 - I gotta go, guys. - Okay, we love you!
 - Love you.
 - You are totally fine.
 - [sighs in relief]
 And, um, the lump...
 - A benign cyst.
 - [sighs] Thank God.
 - Listen, you did the right thing coming in.
 You should always call and see me
 no matter what the concern. Better safe than sorry.
 The thing about this specific kind of lump
 is that it can change in size
 based on monthly hormonal shifts.
 It's harmless, but very common
 in someone with dense breasts.
 - Uh, which I have?
 - Yes.
 A cancerous lump, on the other hand,
 is immovable and painless.
 Well, most of the time.
 - Well, I check myself every day.
 - That's good.
 The more you get to know your breasts, the better.
 Here is a list of maintenance actions you can take.
 I like 10,000 IUs of Vitamin D.
 Take it every day for a couple of months.
 And maybe cut back on coffee.
 Just keep up with your maintenance.
 Warning checks, appointments every couple of months.
 I know this is scary,
 but you are good right now.
 - Thank you.
 - Bye. - Bye.
 [calming piano music]
 [exhales]
 - Hey.
 - It was a false alarm.
 - [exhales] Oh, thank God.
 I'm so glad you're okay. - Me, too.
 I'm better than okay, I'm-- I'm perfect.
 - You wanna get out of here?
 I can walk you back to the office?
 Help you prep for your "30 Under 30" interview?
 - Sure.
 Actually, you know what? No.
 - No?
 - I have a bunch of sick days I've never taken.
 We can have like a "Ferris Bueller's Day Off."
 We could go see a parade or a museum.
 - Okay.
 - So, you're in? - I'm in.
 - Mm-kay.
 [both chuckle]
 - [giggles]
 Mindy, I don't even know
 how you graduated with us.
 You skipped school for an entire week
 because you fell for that Parisian
 in Piazza San Marco.
 - Yeah, well that was love.
 - Oh, that was so not love. - [giggles]
 - But, I forgive you
 because anybody can be fooled by an accent.
 - Mm-hmm.
 Speaking of delicious men
 with delicious accents, how's Ian?
 - Um...
 We're separated.
 - What?
 - Yeah. - When?
 - A couple of weeks ago.
 - Oh, honey.
 - I think he resents my career.
 [sighs] And now he's in Ukraine
 on assignment, and...
 doing God knows what.
 - And what are you doing?

 looking after the kids and-- - Okay.
 I mean, that's great, but you're coming out
 with Lori and me.

 - Thanks, but she doesn't know that.
 I mean not that I expect Oliver to give me credit
 every time I come up with a good idea,
 but it just sucks being an assistant,
 and this Instagram thing is not working.
 - I think you need to cross-pollinate.
 - Like a bee? - Mm-hmm.
 You remember when I posted that picture of you
 from the sex party on the "Scarlet" account,
 and then you got like 5,000 new followers within a week.
 You just need to find someone with a boatload of followers.
 Get them to tag you.
 What about Brooke? - Oh.
 The girl who tricked me into putting a bunch of cocaine
 on the company credit card. [laughs]
 - Yeah! - Yeah.
 - No. - Oh.
 You wanna come eat with me and Adena?

 instead I'm gonna eat by myself

 can actually kill you.

 Okay, but this is fun.
 Why did you never tell me that you pegged a guy?
 - Well, I mean it just happened.
 - You were with a guy recently?
 - Yeah, and honestly
 I'm probably more surprised than you are.
 I was actually seeing this-- this girl from Jersey
 who was wrong for me in the best way possible.
 And, um, this guy, he was bartending and--
 - Hmm.

 stick to talking about work.

 It wasn't about you oversharing.
 - Is it 'cause I was with a dude?
 - Um, the lesbian community can be complicated.
 - Wow. - It's not right.
 It's just some lesbians
 take issue with--
 when other people infiltrate their spaces.
 - Infiltrate? - It's not my word.
 I'm just letting you know what I've heard other women say.
 - I feel like this has been my community for a while now.
 - I'm just telling you how-- how some lesbians
 see bisexuality.
 Some women...are triggered, um,

 I just started seeing a...

 And I haven't done that in a while.
 Haven't done it since I met Adena.
 And honesty, it's been really fun.
 But I think I should end it.
 - Do you want to end it?
 - Not really. Nope.
 But, if I like men and women,
 then why not just pick a lane, you know?
 Choose the one that needs more representation.
 - You want to date women
 so the optics look good for Instagram?
 - I just want it to be less complicated.
 That's all.
 And Adena
 invited me to this queer party
 tonight with all the people from Wild Susan.
 But when she found out I was hooking up with a guy,
 she said that I shouldn't come.
 That the lesbian community would have a hard time with it.
 - Wow.
 So bisexual erasure is still a thing.
 - That's what I said.

 I'm just...
 I'm so over trying to fit in, you know?
 I am never quiteright.
 I'm not black. Not white.
 Not gay and not straight.
 It--where's the space in between?
 - You have to create it.
 And you claim it as your own.
 Look.
 When I first came into the light
 of my own sexual being...
 - Hm.
 - I told people I was bi.
 And everybody tried to shame me,
 and tell me that bi
 was just a pit stop on the way to being gay.
 I mean, in my case, they were right.
 But having other people
 define my experience was not right.
 It was my journey and I needed
 to live it on my own authentic terms.
 - Yeah, see, I don't know
 how to define my experience.
 Especially when there's no space
 that's specifically for people like me.
 - Any queer space is your space.
 You should go tonight.
 And tell them that you're proud of who you are,
 and that you deserve to be there just as much as they do.

 31 and 32 and...

 - Being on this list meant everything to me this morning.
 But that was before I found a lump in my breast,

 See, I have the BRCA mutation,
 so my life isn't a given.
 My mother passed away
 when she was 32 from cancer and...
 I guess I hadn't realized until today
 that I always thought
 that could be my expiration date too.
 So I'm sorry,
 but instead of focusing on
 what I've achieved before 30, I...

 Today was a really good day.
 I mean, being with you, and...
 dancing, and...
 riding bikes. [laughs]
 I felt alive, you know?
 - I think I do.
 - I wanna feel like that every day.
 - Mm.
 - Like nothing can stop me.
 I know why I was avoiding my "30 Under 30" interview.
 - Huh?
 - Being recognized for all of my achievements
 before 30, it just...
 I don't know.
 It made me feel like
 my obituary was being written?
 [sighs]
 I'm gonna get the double mastectomy.
 I know my options,
 and it's either fear and maintenance,
 or remove the risk altogether.
 [dramatic piano music]
 At first I thought that I could never
 put my body through that, but...
 I don't know, after feeling that lump today, I just...
 I feel like living like this would be harder.
 Like I would always be waiting for the other shoe to drop.
 - [exhales]
 - Look, what I'm gonna have to do is...
 not gonna be pretty.
 It's gonna be
 [sighs] a lot of drains
 and expanders and...
 it's gonna be a lot to deal with.
 So...
 I understand if you don't want to.

 There's no way that this is where our story ends.

 - Hey, babe.
 - You okay?
 - Not really.
 I've been trying so hard
 to prove myself to Oliver, and I just...
 really messed it all up.
 - Sutton, Oliver loves you.
 - Not anymore, he doesn't. He just opposite-yelled at me.
 - What does that mean?
 - He just sat there and didn't say anything.
 - Yikes.
 Yeah, maybe it's not as bad as you think it.
 What happened?
 - This big influencer
 that we work with, Alice Knight,
 I cross-pollinated with her.
 And crossed a line with Oliver in doing so.
 Because I wanted to get
 over 20,000 followers on Instagram.
 It's so stupid.
 - Sutton, you are more than the number of followers,
 and Oliver knows that.
 - Yeah, I just feel really stuck right now, you know?
 Work's a mess, and Instagram's a mess, and...
 I really love New York, but without you here,
 this is, like, really hard.
 Sorry.

 - Yeah. Me too.
 - You know what? I'm gonna come home.

 I'll move things around.
 Take a couple days.
 I wanna be there for you.
 Plus, we have this whole wedding thing to plan.

 - Call me when you get your flight?
 - Yeah, of course. It's gonna be okay.
 - Hey. Where'd you go last night?
 - I wasn't in the mood, so I left.
 - Oh. Well.
 It's a shame 'cause it was
 a really fun night, actually.
 And I realized, uh,
 nobody there seemed to have an issue
 with the fact that I'm bisexual.
 The only one who really had an issue with it was you.
 - I'm fine with bisexuals, Kat.
 I just wasn't expecting
 you to be one of them.
 - Okay, well, I am.
 And I shouldn't be made to feel less than because of it.
 - No, you shouldn't.
 I'm--I'm sorry I said those things.
 - I--
 It just, the whole thing got me, like,
 really in my head, you know?
 I wasn't expecting that from you.
 - Because I was hurt, Kat.
 And emotional.
 You being with a man makes me wonder
 if what we had between us was just a phase for you.
 If it was even real.
 - Adena, my feelings for you were very real.
 They are very real.
 - I just--I don't think that--
 I don't think that it's a good idea for us to be friends.
 I think, from now on, it's just best for us
 to keep things strictly professional.
