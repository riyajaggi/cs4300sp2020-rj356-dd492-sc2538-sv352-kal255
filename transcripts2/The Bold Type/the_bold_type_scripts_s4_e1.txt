 - Previously on "The Bold Type"... - Ever since I lost the election, I've been looking for something to make me feel better. I need to find myself again, but I can't do that if I just jump back into a relationship with you. See, these women all have an incredible cause that people need to hear about. I was hoping to work with these women when I took office, and today I realized I still can. - It's my book tour itinerary. 23 cities in 8 weeks.

 - One minute, you're telling me that you want to move in with me, and then the next, you're kissing someone else. - It meant nothing, I swear. - It meant something to me. You can't mess up like this again, 'cause I love you. - I love you too, Sutton. - I know. You made me a better writer. - I really do believe that you have the potential to be exceptional. - Richard, you deserve to love what you do. You have to at least try. So I bought you a ticket to San Francisco. - It has always been my mission to make "Scarlet" a leader when it comes to empowering women,

 but we can't do that unless we examine ourselves, which means we need new fashion spreads, new articles, more inclusivity, and we must get it right. - Fairy tales are fantasies. What if we didn't focus on the fantasy? What if we... - Aimed the camera at the mice. - How did your meeting with the board go? - They don't want me to move forward with this plan. - But you're doing it anyway? - It's the right thing to do. And "Scarlet" is still my magazine... until it's not. [insects chirping, wind whooshing] [energetic bass music thumping] [chain-link fence jingling] - This is crazy. ♪ - Come on, Spider-Woman, let's go. - Yeah, smooth dismount. - Oh! - Oh, no. Are you okay? [laughter] - Yeah, I'm good. I'm fine. - You're good? - Oh. - Oh, no. - What's happening. - Shit. Is that security? - Oh, my God. I think it's a cop. - I can't go to jail in my skivvies. - ♪ Make your girlfriend mad type ♪ ♪ Might seduce your dad type - Oh! I dropped the wine. - ♪ I'm the bad guy [upbeat music] ♪ - Excuse me, ladies. - This doesn't make any sense. - What--Hello. - What is this? - Are you shitting me? - Why are they packing up Jacqueline's office? - Wait. - Andrew... - Yeah, yeah? - What's going on? - Where's Jacqueline? - I don't know. - What do you mean you don't know? - I mean I literally cannot find her. Um, her phone is off, and her emails just keep bouncing back, so I don't know where she could be. - There has to be a misunderstanding. - Excuse me. That's Jacqueline's treadmill. Who told you that you could remove that from Jacqueline's office? - I did. Uh, please, if I could just have everyone's attention for a moment. As some of you might have surmised from this morning's commotion, the board is making a change at "Scarlet." Effective immediately, Jacqueline Carlyle is no longer editor in chief. - What? - Oh, my God. - I will be taking her position, and I will do my best to live up to her legacy. - Um, is this a joke? - I am well aware this news comes as a surprise to many of you, but the most important thing we can do right now is get back to putting out the best possible magazine. Oh, that reminds me. I would love to do a roundup of our favorite rosés. - A rosé roundup? Really? After we just made a groundbreaking issue? - Mm-mm. - Sage, Alex, take the lead. There will be a transition period as we find our footing, but rest assured... we will find it. All right, people. I have some housekeeping, but we'll gather later for pitches. I'm excited. - Yeah, I'm gonna be sick. [moans] - Andrew, hold on. Nope. We're gonna breathe. In for two, out for four. You ready? - No. This isn't happening. He can't take her job. - Jane, heel. Don't do something you're gonna regret. Kat... - Yep? - Closet. - Okay, I'll be right back. - No, no, no, no. - You got it. I'll be right back, okay? - Okay. - Can they really do this? - Well, they just did. - How do you replace Jacqueline Carlyle? She just sent her best issue off to the printers. - Well, I actually heard that the board never approved it, so maybe they're saying it's insubordination. - She's the editor in chief. I've seen her be insubordinate a million times. - See, now, that's not really helping her case. - Yes, it is. Jacqueline's fearlessness is what makes this magazine special. Ugh! I cannot believe I trusted Patrick. - Oh. Wait. Adena, her offer to work here-- Jacqueline gave it to her. - Do you know how much this place is gonna change? Guys, she's the best boss we're ever gonna have. - Yeah. - Remember when she said "labia" three times to RJ just to see him blush? - [laughs] Yeah. - We have to fix this. - I'm gonna talk to Richard. - I am gonna talk to Patrick and see where his heart is on this. - And I'm gonna find Jacqueline. I mean, if anybody has a plan, it's her. - Wait, hey, whoa. - Did you just red rover me? - Yes. Triple hug. Come on. We need it. - I love you guys. - Lean in. Mm-hmm. - Mm. - Okay. I love you, too, but we have to go. - Okay. - Oh. - Hey. What are you doing? - Oh, it's a dark day. I think this will help. - I'm telling you, this is the new media playbook. Step one-- fire the beloved boss. Step two--replace her with a cheap wunderkind. - Step three--fire half of us, turn the other half into freelancers churning out sponcon 24-7. - What? Shh. Here they come. - [clears throat] - Why are they staring at us? - I don't know. - What's going on? - Well, we knew y'all were talking in the closet, and we thought we would leave you alone so you could think. - Okay. - So... what do we think? - Well, I mean, we think this sucks, and we're gonna try to find a way to fix it. - Yep. - Mm-hmm. - That's it? That--that's the plan? I'm asking my friend if her sustainable vibrator startup is still hiring. - Wait. Hold up. Hold up. We have a plan. We just--it's, uh... - Of course. - Yeah. We have a plan. - Absolutely. - We're ironing out the details. - Yeah, okay, so I can't lose this job, because I cannot do anything else. - Yeah. - Oh, my God. - It's okay. Come on. Come on. Come on. Alex and I are chugging--um, "testing" rosé. - Oh, I can do that. - Okay, yeah. No, we--we can't let this happen. - Right. - Look at Oliver. He's gonna leave, isn't he, if Jacqueline's gone? - Well, you heard Jane. We're gonna fix it. - Hey, would you give me a minute? I'll be right with you. - That's new. - I stress-stole it. - Yeah. I get it. I'm as shocked as you are. - Isn't there anything we can do about it? - Do you know how many times I've talked RJ down from the ledge from something Jacqueline did? I thought I could do it this time, but... [exhales sharply] he's really pissed at her. She completely ignored him by publishing that issue. - Yeah. Oliver's gonna leave if Jacqueline's gone. - You don't know that. - I do. I just feel like I'm losing you and "Scarlet" at the same time. - Hey, it's just a sabbatical in San Francisco, and you could never lose me. - [chuckles] [cell phone vibrates] - Sorry. Wow. Listen, it's gonna be pretty wild around here for the next couple days. Hang in there, all right? - Yeah. - Hey. Sorry. Thanks for waiting. [dramatic music] ♪ [telephone rings] - Hey. How you doing? - Okay. How's it going out there? - It's good. Like a party. Like Fyre Fest. - People just need a little time. - Hmm. I see you've wasted no time getting settled in. - Studies show managerial changes are best done swiftly. - Mm. So you're okay with all this? - It brings me no joy Jacqueline was fired, Kat. - But, I mean, you feel like you can take the reins and order a bunch of, uh... Rosé taste tests? - Jacqueline was canned for provoking RJ and the board, and I would like to keep this job. [telephone rings] RJ, hey. Yeah, I'm actually with her right now. [whispering] RJ wants to see you. - Why? - Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. - Did he say why? - No, I know them. ♪ - Most people open an expensive bottle of wine to celebrate something, but I find it much more useful on days like this. - I just can't believe that after everything you've done, they would-- - [shushing] Taste the wine first. - [scoffs] I... I thought you would have been holding a pitchfork ready to burn down Safford. - Oh, that was my first instinct, but... my lawyers advised against it. - They can't just fire you. - No, they can't. Corporations like Safford need cause. They need a file documenting all fireable offenses. And they have that file on me. It's about, eh, this thick. - Okay, uh, so what are you gonna do? - I am gonna enjoy the fact that I created a magazine that I am very proud of. Publishing that last issue... really mattered. And when people see it... they will understand why I did it. - So your walk against domestic violence-- are you still gonna be there? - Of course. Just because I'm no longer at "Scarlet" doesn't mean I'm ever gonna stop fighting for women. - [sighs] [indistinct chatter] RJ, Patrick said you wanted to see me. - Follow me, please. We're not releasing Jacqueline's last issue of "Scarlet" magazine. - Uh, but it's already been printed, right? And we have a bunch of social media tie-ins that are-- - I didn't approve the issue, Kat. It's not coming out. We are crafting a statement saying we were unable to agree on renewal terms with Jacqueline, which means--have a seat-- that we need that unified message on all "Scarlet" fronts-- Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat. - But people are gonna want to talk about this. - You will tell them not to. That's the game plan. That's your job. - But this past issue was a huge step forward for the magazine editorially, and I just feel like-- - "Scarlet" is not a passion project. It's a business. It survives because companies like Western Denim and Defined Cosmetics pay millions of dollars of advertising to it. Do you think Middle America wants to see a photo spread of lumberjacks in ball gowns? Do you think they want to be told their favorite jeans contribute to climate change? They don't. This--this bubble you all live in downstairs, it is not the rest of the world. - And RJ is not releasing the magazine, so all of those changes that Jacqueline made to be inclusive and call out our industry are just... - Gone. See you later. - [sighs] - Still no word from Adena either. God, this sucks. - Yeah. When I talked to Jacqueline, it was like she accepted it, because she was proud of the issue we created and she knew that when people read it, they would understand why she did what she did, because it mattered, and now no one's gonna see it. - Not even her. - But I think she needs to. - What does that mean? - Maybe if she sees how great the issue is, then she'll understand how important she is and she'll push back. There's got to be a digital copy somewhere, right? - I don't know. They took Jacqueline's computer. - Maybe Andrew has one. We should call him. - Me? - Yeah. - Andrew hates me. - He does not hate you. - Yeah. He kind of does. It's a territorial, Jacqueline thing. - Oh. [line trilling] - [crying] Hello? - Hi, Andrew. You--you okay? - Mm-hmm. [both mouthing words] - Give me the phone. Andrew, it's Jane. I was just wondering if maybe you had a digital copy of the latest issue. - No. Uh, the files were all wiped. There's nothing left of that issue or Jacqueline. Oh, I have to go. - Hmm. - He's fine, right? - Yeah, he's fine. So that's it? It's just wiped off the face of the Earth? - Not necessarily. - Hmm? - Well, our printing facility, it's in Piscataway, right? - Yeah. - If the magazine is not being distributed... - Mm-hmm. - Then it's still at the warehouse until it gets destroyed, right? Which could be at any moment. - So you're trying to go to Piscataway, New Jersey, right now? - Yeah. - Is she drunk? Are you drunk? - Not as much as I'd like to be. Bring the bottle. - So what do we do when we get there? - We wing it. - ♪ Come on, let's go ♪ Hey, let's go - You have your ID badge? - Our what? - Excuse me? - Oh. - Uh, you know, I think we're just gonna get out here. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Thank you. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Thank you so much.

Come on. - Wait, what do we do when we actually get in? There's gonna be a security guard. - Simple.

This is not where I was expecting this to go, but I love it. [both mimic techno music] Get it. Get it. Do you have any dollars, Jane? - Yeah! - You're gonna have to take these imaginary dollars, but I swear... - All right. Here she comes. - Okay. - Get ready to catch it. [groans] Oh.

Kat, you're up. - Wait. What? Oh. Hey, wait. No. I-- Guys, I don't know. I feel kind of rusty and... - What? - Like, insecure. - You literally just had two women vying for your attention, like, three days ago. - Yeah. She's right.

Something I can do for you? - Um, I don't know, maybe. - Well, maybe you should come back when you know. - [scoffs] - Okay. - Yeah, yeah, I'll do that. I'll do that. - Hi. Um... We poured our hearts into the fall issue of "Scarlet," and I believe it's somewhere in this facility, but for reasons I won't bore you with, it's not being released. So it would mean the world to us-- and someone who really matters to us-- if we could get a few copies. - I love "Scarlet." - [gasps] You do? - Read every issue before it ships. I thought this last one was amazing. - Oh. Yeah. So did we. But there were some concerns with its content. - That's too bad. My partner and I have a teenage daughter. I was excited she'd get to see some people in those pages who look like her mom for once. - Yeah. We were excited for that, too. - Okay, I'll tell you what-- I can't give you a magazine, but if you were to take a few from around the corner, third room on the left--you know, when I'm in the bathroom... there's not much I can do about that. - [gasps] - What? - Jane. - And a wink? - Really very impressive, Jane. - Thank you. - I feel like I loosened the jar. - Hey.

The day we met. - Mm. I was shooting for "Rolling Stone." You were interviewing Ama Adhe. We played chess that day. - We did a little more than play chess. - It might be nice just to press pause for a while. - Well... I'm not really the "press pause" type, but maybe. - And... I wouldn't mind going back to work. - Well, then... then you should. - Okay. I'll put out some feelers. - ♪ Holiday when ♪ You're gone ♪ - This issue is amazing. Jacqueline was a genius to use the models like this. I mean, it really shows how exploitative it is. - Oh, this is why I loved this issue. Transparency, you know, real weights-- younger me would have loved this. - [gasps] [both gasp] - Oh! - It's so good. - I remember when we told Luke that he could be in the magazine. He was so excited to show the photos to his dad. - Oh, I never saw Jacqueline's letter. "It is up to all of us to represent every shape, size, "color, and sexual orientation out there. "We see you, and you deserve to see yourselves, and now you will in the pages of 'Scarlet.'" I love that. - You know, Jacqueline needs a copy, but I think she's really saying all of these people need a copy. - Who? - The people in the magazine and the people who helped make it. They deserve to see themselves and to know that what they did matters. - Yeah. Well, RJ certainly doesn't think so. - See? There's the reason to do it. - Okay. Hear me out. - Mm-hmm. - I have an address for Luke in Queens, and I think the makeup artist is somewhere in Bushwick, and I think the girl who did the sustainable fashion thing is in Tribeca. - Wait. Are you saying that we should... - We're gonna have to split this ride, y'all. Those people are getting magazines. [upbeat pop music] ♪ - Good morning, sunshine. Coffee? - Yes, please. Where's Angie? I thought she was staying over. - Angie is, uh, going on "The Bachelor." - What? Wait, so what does this mean? Are you guys taking a break? - No, Jane, we're staying together to test the boundaries of our love. Of course we're going on a break. - Do you think she's gonna get on "Bachelor in Paradise"? - This isn't about you, Jane. - It's about her. You're gonna find someone. - I don't need you to tell me that. [cell phone vibrates] Whoa. Hey. I thought the last issue wasn't coming out. - It's not. - This is interesting. "Read the scorched-earth editor's letter that got Jacqueline Carlyle fired." - What? Where is that? - It's on "The Cut." A lot of stuff from the issue is. Work should be interesting. - [whispering] How did this get out? - Do you remember last night, Jane? - Yes, but I put a note on everybody's copy, and it said, "For your eyes only." I guess a note won't really prevent people from leaking it. - Yeah. No. Do we think that Jacqueline did it? [all clear throats] - What is your favorite fruit? - I'm gonna have to say banana. - Yeah. - It's just... - Okay. So I just--I thought that she was gonna get inspired and just pick up the phone and call RJ. - Okay. Well, at least RJ can't publish a replacement issue now. What's that? - Jane? Who are you texting? - I was just asking Jacqueline if she did it. - Oh, my God. - On a text, Jane? - Hey, whoa. Hey. - We can't get caught. - Right. - All right? - Right. - Okay. [whispering] So what are we gonna do? - [whispering] We are going to... just--just be cool. - [scoffs] - That's a solid plan. - I'm not cool. - Just be cool, Jane. - [sighs] - We cool? - Yeah. We're cool. - Yeah. - Have you guys seen this? - What is it? - [laughing] Wait. Did you guys do this? - Mm-mm. - No. - Was this the plan? - No. This was not the plan. - Definitely not... - No. - Part of the plan. - Hmm. Well, I think it's pretty awesome. - Listen, whoever did this... [chuckles] is my hero. Oh, and, uh, people are loving the fairy-tale shoot. - Good morning, people. Despite the "Game of Thrones" level intrigue surrounding "Scarlet" right now, it's business as usual for us. Management has a team working on the source of the leak, so, everyone, please, back to work. Oh, uh, Kat, a word in my office, please. - Yes. - A team. He has a team. He has a team working on the leak. - A team of people. - That's not good. - That's not cool. - Mm-mm. - It was cool before. Now it's less cool. - Kat? - No, no, no. It's still cool. Richard's a lawyer. Yep. - Oh, my God. - Yeah. - I'm gonna call my lawyer. - Okay. I'm... Um... - [knocks on glass] - [sighs] - Hi. - Any thoughts on the leak? - [sighs] Not really. - Some people think it's Jacqueline, but I don't know. She has a quiet dignity that seems at odds with airing dirty laundry. - That's true. - We will know who it is soon enough. - Mm-hmm. Probably. - What I don't get is the why. - What do you mean? - Why would someone risk their job over this? - Well... because it's not about metrics or numbers or what studies show. It's about soul... the soul of "Scarlet" magazine. - I have soul, Kat. - Come on, Patrick, I know you got soul. I've seen you fight the occasional fight. But... soul like Jacqueline? Enough to make people risk their jobs for you? I don't know. Uh... I should probably get back to work. - Thank you, Kat. - Yeah. - If we can trace it, we'll have grounds for intellectual property theft. Okay. Sounds good. Standing by. RJ is livid. - Yeah. I bet. - So you were out late last night. - Yeah. I was with the girls. We ended up Ubering to New Jersey. Yeah. Crazy. It's a funny story, actually. Um, you ever get swept up in a moment? - So you hooked up with some guy in Jersey. - [laughs] No! But I might have taken a handful of magazines from the printing plant in Piscataway. - Please tell me that you are kidding. Oh, my God. - We wanted to get a copy of the magazine for Jacqueline, and then when we saw it, we handed a couple of them out. - There are cameras all over that plant, Sutton. How could you do this? - How could we not? Have you seen the magazine? There are people who have been marginalized over and over again who are front and center for the first time in their lives, and now what? They're gonna be marginalized again? At the very least, those people deserve to see themselves in print, and Jacqueline deserves to know that it wasn't all for nothing. - Come here. I love you. - Mm, I love you. - But this--this is bad. - I know. [sighs] [solemn music] ♪ - The security team's going over all the footage from the facility. It's just a matter of time before you guys are caught. - We're gonna lose our jobs. - Yeah. - What? What? - If Safford decides to press charges, this could continue. - Oh, my God. - Well, at least the response to what we did is good. The online reaction is huge. - Ooh, yeah. Could you read some stuff? I'd like some validation. - "This is exactly the content we need today. "'Scarlet' was just canceled in my book. They're censoring a woman for telling the truth." That is from "Agnes, 58, Prairie City, Iowa." - Where are the other ones from? - Uh, Springfield, Missouri, and Athens, Texas. - Middle America. - Yeah. Why? - What if we can make getting caught not matter? Get us out of trouble, get Jacqueline her job back. - Then we have no problems. Continue. - Okay, so RJ said he was firing Jacqueline for business reasons, right? Said advertisers who rely on sales in Middle America felt that the issue was not in line with their brands, but, I mean, come on, people all over the country are clearly loving these pages, so... what if it's just bad business to fire Jacqueline now? - Well, he does have a fiduciary responsibility to the shareholders to do what's in the best interest of the magazine. - Make money. - Yeah. - And he's not doing that if Agnes from Iowa is canceling her subscription. - There's a board meeting tomorrow at 2:00 to discuss Patrick's takeover. If you can make a case in front of them that firing Jacqueline is bad business... - Then they'd have to rehire her. - We live in a fast-paced, high-tech world with short attention spans. So how do you make an impression when no one's paying attention? You stand for something-- or, in some cases, you kneel. Nike kneeled with Colin Kaepernick, and their sales spiked 31%. Gillette took a stand against toxic masculinity, and the response was tremendous. And, you know, they did this not just because it was the right thing to do, but also because... you know, it just made sense for their bottom line. And it turns out I'm not the only one who feels this way. I'm sure you remember Josh Blagg from Defined Cosmetics, one of "Scarlet's" biggest advertisers with a huge emphasis in Middle America. Turns out Josh agrees. - We had reservations, but Kat made a compelling case with the online reaction to the pages. We might have been too cautious. - I took a look at "Scarlet's" social this morning. 92% of our mentions are negative. Now, it's no secret we're the number-one magazine at this company, but right now we're not losing advertisers as much as we're losing readers. Staying number one is not a given. - We can't afford a PR disaster right now, and it'll get worse when we announce Patrick's hiring. [men murmur softly] - I have a thought. We release the embargoed issue, save the printing costs, and announce that Jacqueline will resume her duties as editor in chief immediately. - [scoffs] - Now, I know there was a game plan, RJ, but it wasn't working. Kind of seems like maybe the bubble you live in is bursting. - Thank you, Kat. That'll be all. - Okay. Thank you. Should we get lunch? - That's a great idea. [upbeat music] ♪ [camera shutter clicking] - I knew if I left you three in the fashion closet, you'd fix this. - Me too. What? Total faith. - I'd like to thank you all for being here today and to remind you that today's march to end domestic violence is just one step in our journey to protect, celebrate, and inspire women and men everywhere. - We're not done. Jacqueline still has her part to do. - I still can't believe she's not the one who leaked it. Who did? [cheers and applause] - Jacqueline. - RJ. - Hi. - It's nice of you to come out and show your support. - Oh, your assistant said if I wanted to talk, I had to come to you, so here I am. - Well? - I was wrong. So... let's get you back in charge of "Scarlet," where you belong. - Well, I have a couple of conditions. - Okay. - I need your word that all of my employees' jobs are safe. - Wait--those three broke into a warehouse. I have video... - And they made your asset, "Scarlet" magazine, better. - Okay. Fine. You have my word. - One last request, and we have a deal. - Okay. - March with us. - No, I--you know, I don't have the time. - Make the time. I really appreciate you being an advocate for women, RJ. - There is one more thing that we need to talk about. - What's that? - The industry is changing. We're dropping print. Your last issue will be released, but from this point going forward, "Scarlet" magazine will be all digital. So do we have a deal? - Of course. - Good. [upbeat music] ♪ - Ian. Hi. - Honey, are you almost home? We're having ramen tonight. - Oh, my gosh. You know what? I'm sorry. This has been such a crazy afternoon, and you will not believe this, but RJ offered me my job back. - Really? - Yeah! And "Scarlet" is going all digital, which is gonna be a little learning curve for me, but you know what? I'm kind of excited about it. - You're taking it? - Yeah, of course. - Well, you should know that I put those feelers out, and Mark Afton at "States and Nations" magazine, he's looking for a freelance photographer. - Oh. Okay. Well, that's amazing. No, I mean, Patrick and I are sharing the load, so--so... Well, I'll be home soon, and we'll figure it out. - Okay. I'll see you soon. - Okay. Bye. [sighs] [knock on glass] Oh. Patrick. - Hello, Jacqueline. - We missed you at the walk today. - I had some packing to do. - Really? Where are you going? - I'm headed to India next week to pay a visit to one of my favorite ashrams in Varanasi. It's sort of an in-between-gigs cleanse. - I thought we were doing this together. - Jacqueline, if there's one thing I learned this week, it's that this is your ship. You do not need me to run it with you. - Well, I may not need you to run it with me, but I do think we make a good team. - Thank you. - Patrick, safe travels. - You keep it. It looks good in your office. [upbeat pop music] [woman vocalizing] ♪ ♪ Lately it's been a little bit wild ♪ [indistinct chatter] - When you're here, you're family. [laughter] - Hi. Um, can I please see your second-cheapest tequila? Thank you. - Why the second? - [gasps] Look who it is. - Ryan. Oh, my God, hi. - Hi. - Hey, so, um, in exchange for you saving "Scarlet" and keeping us out of jail, I have for you this shitty tequila. - Oh. Thank you. [glasses clink] ♪ - [exhales sharply] - [groans] - What are you doing here? - They let me cut the tour short. They said they'd take the money that they saved and roll it into the advance for my next book. - Wow. Uh, so you're back. - Yeah. - That's awesome. - I'm gonna ask for that sabbatical, and it could all happen really quickly. It could get bumpy. - This is great. We're gonna be great. - I hope so... because this was terrible. I'm gonna get us four--five... - Yeah. - Shots of the opposite of whatever that is. - Okay. - Want to give me a hand? - Sure. - Hey, um, guys, so Adena texted me back. - [gasps] What'd she say? - Uh, the offer went through, so that's good. Jacqueline sent her on an assignment. She's going to Alabama to take photos in school districts where they ban sex ed. - Oh, that's cool. - Hey, can I get a rum and Coke? - Yeah, it's great. And she asked me to give her some space, so... - Well, I mean, that's probably a good idea, right? - Yeah. I know. It make sense. I just hope she's okay. - Yeah. - Excuse me. - [gasps] Hi. - Luke! - Sutton! I missed you at the march. - Hey. How are you? - Good, and you? - Good. Hey, did you give your dad the magazine? - He framed it. - Oh. - He put it in his office. - Oh! I am so happy for you. - Thanks. Hey, you guys didn't mind that I sent it to "The Cut," right? - You--you did? - No. - No. - Not at all. - Okay, good. That's a relief. - Yeah. - All right. Well, have a good night. - You too. [gasps] It was him!
