 Previously on "The Bold Type"... I screwed up. I kissed somebody else. I'm so, so sorry. I don't trust him. Tonight's runway prize goes to Sutton. But I don't think designing is my passion. Styling is my passion. How do you make an impression when no one's paying attention? You stand for something. "Scarlet" magazine is a powerful place,

 and I'm not gonna take that for granted anymore. With digital, we can reach out in ways that I never even allowed myself to imagine, you know what I mean? Not allowing yourself to imagine something. I did that for the last ten years and I'm not doing it any more. I had told Richard to move to San Francisco. Sutton Brady, will you marry me? Yeah. Oh, Sutton. This tiny little handcuff is gorgeous. I know. It's perfect. But is it gorgeous enough for us to forget

 that it is a symbol of patriarchal oppression? - Yeah. - Yeah, I know. - You're right. - You would never wear one? That's like asking what my favorite ice cream is on Pluto. It's very hypothetical. I'm sorry, who is this? I've never seen her. Oh, hello. I'm short-hair Jane. - I have no words. - I went to a new hair lady, and I was very terrified about it, but I think it turned out pretty great, what do you think? - It's very Posh Spice. - Très chic. Thank you! "Spice Up Your Life," you know? So Jane got a new haircut, Sutton got a new ring, and I got the image of Sutton and Richard fornicating on the table when I present in the boardroom? - You're welcome. - At least it wasn't one of those really embarrassing public proposals. - Oh, yeah. - I'd say "yes" - just to make it stop. - Mm-hmm. So what are you gonna do about your last name? Are you gonna keep Brady, or... Mrs. Richard Hunter? Oh my God. You could be Mrs. Dick Hunter. - Nice. - You know what? We got engaged three days ago. We don't have a venue or a date or a registry, so. Um, how are you doing? What's the happ with Ryan? Mm, meh, don't really want to talk about it. - What? - That won't do. We always talk about our problems. And it always makes us feel better most of the time. Yeah, but you know what? Not today. I just don't feel like it. - That won't work. - Use this, Kat. She'll talk. - Jane, my love. - What are you doing? Say something. - Please get up. - Jane, I love you. Talk to me, please. - Say something! - Come on, Jane, answer her. Love is love. Love is love, Jane. Okay, fine. Ryan and I haven't had sex since he got back from his book tour, and it's becoming a problem. You're right. I kind of feel better about it. So, talking helped? - Yes! - She said yes! Yes! Okay, so bon voyage luncheon with the entire Ukraine team. When is it? Everyone's family is invited. So I could switch Connor's tutor to Sunday, James has an early morning home game. We could all go. Come on. Or not. Oh, sorry. I wasn't talking to you. It's just RJ. Since we went all-digital he has been up my ass with web traffic. But yes, Saturday. Ukraine luncheon, bon voyage, great. The whole family, got it. Sorry, uh... Small team pitch meeting is now. All right, gotta go, Ducks. Bye. With "Scarlet" going digital, we have an opportunity to exploit an event in real-time in a way we never did. An event like Sunday's marathon. 22,000 women runners giving it their all, perfect for the new "Scarlet." Oh my God, I've actually been reading about some really amazing female runners. I feel like maybe social could profile them and we could get our readers to track them, you know, live on race day from the website. - Love it, Kat. - Thanks. Oliver, photo shoot. Um. Functional jogging fashion? Um, maybe we could use the runners that I profile as models? Done. And with no more print costs, let's be expansive, let's use lots of models. All shapes and all sizes. So an expansive shoot with... civilians. Welcome to digital, Oliver. - Mm-hmm. - Jane, marathon pitch. We always watch the race from this street in Brooklyn and drink bloodies and talk about how we're gonna run it next year. I could do a story on that community. Community of lazy drunks, love it. Let's think of something else. We're still going to our spot, right? - Oh, yeah. - Okay. Uh, Jacqueline, it's from RJ. He actually said "imperative." It's so obnoxious. Okay, everyone. Keep thinking and if it helps, a marathon can be any lengthy challenge. You know what I love about this idea? "Scarlet" digital is doing all this new stuff, taking it in a new direction, and I think it could be really important, like a manual for the future. Oh, I would love a vertical in that manual. You're gonna get one. Come on, Pamela Dolan, "Am I A Bad Feminist?" Just crank out another one of those. Yeah, 'cause it's that simple. Could write something about you and Ryan. That's kind of a challenge right now, right? Ooh! You can write about your no sex marathon. - Get out. - Yeah. Prospect Park, baby. Hey! Downtown Y, babe! - You hoop? - Surprised? - Well, yeah. - Why? Well, I mean, you just don't seem like the... y'know what, I don't know. No, you don't. Well, at least the clothes and the models are alike in one way. They're all pedestrian and unwashed. So, um, how can I help? Um, Gucci, Prada, and Dior. They make running clothes? I'm in. No, they all want their sample sizes to be returned. Oh, why? "Scarlet" 's new more inclusive mandate. We're shooting fewer zero-size models so they want their stuff back. You want me to do the returns? After they've been steamed and bagged. I have to go find a photographer who's willing to shoot this... prison riot. _ _ - Hey, Chloe. - Hey, Kat. - Quinoa-kale? - Yep. Yes. Oh, the kitchen was trying to short you on the extra cranberries. - What? - No chance. Oh, thank you. Hey, uh, you run, right? Yeah, I love it. Used to run with my dad. Pretty sure that he thought I was still his perfect little son back then. Are you gonna run on Sunday? I would love to. I just didn't qualify. Actually, I did. It's complicated. Oh. Well, how is it complicated? People screw up salad orders. Imagine the red tape around gender correction paperwork. It's complicated. Try me, I might follow. Okay. Um... to get into the race, you have to run the qualifying marathon and when I did I was taking estrogen for over a year. I mean, my testosterone levels were low enough for the Olympics to accept me as a woman. So what happened? My registration was outdated. Still had me listed as male. And in that category, my time wasn't fast enough to qualify. Boo. - Boo. - Mm. Wow. I gotta run, but I'll see ya. - Okay. - Bye. Thank you. So it was just about paperwork? - Yeah. - Man, that's brutal. I mean, not man. Just brutal. It's so complicated. The testosterone levels, the rules for competing. Chloe doesn't even want to compete. She just wants to run as the woman she is. Can't even imagine what that's like for her. Oh, we're just a bunch of cis women in a closet contemplating the trans feminine journey. I want to learn big words and say them fast like you. I wanna help Chloe run. You can write about that. I could, but I think my best chance at a vertical is to write a first-person piece. Wow. You have a great rack. Thank you. I was talking about the other one. So I need a marathon pitch, but it doesn't have to be about running. It could be about any lengthy challenge. Hulu marathon. You're fired. I was thinking that I could write about our challenges. Maybe the, um, current no-sex marathon we've been having. We are kind of having one, yeah. I feel like it's kind of coming from you. Yeah, I just am in my head. I'm having trouble relaxing ever since. Since I screwed up. I don't know if this is weird, but there's a guy on my hockey team who's talked about tantric sex. You're talking about tantric sex with the Zambronis? Not all the time but it came up. This guy Teddy, he's really smart. And, uh, he says it helped save his marriage. Helped them reconnect. Maybe it could help us. Great. So we will try tantric sex. All right. What else do the Zambronis talk about? "Tantric techniques bring awareness and intention to sex "to increase emotional connection - and intimacy." - Hmm. "While orgasm is not the goal..." - What? - Jane and Ryan are having full-on tantric sex. Oh. "Spiritual connection is. Orgasm can be an extremely pleasurable byproduct." Well, you go to your church, I'll go to mine. Let's just hope this church helps me. Hey, guys. What should I order from Balsamic that says "Celebration?" - Scotch. - Asparagus. Okay, well, I'm gonna see if Chloe can bring me dinner, 'cause I just got her into the marathon. Shut the front door. How'd you do it? Well, sometimes when people get injured they sell their bibs online. - So you bought her a bib. - Yeah. Look at Kat, working the black market. Thank you. Um... but, hey, maybe as a "Scarlet" writer we should not use "black market." It has some negative racial connotations, kind of a weird history and, uh, you know, manual for the future. Yeah, totally. Hear you. Well, at least in fashion being the new black is a great thing. I'm gonna show these running hijabs to Oliver. - Adena has one of those. - Adena runs? Uh, no, but you know, I have a motorcycle jacket, you have flight pants and you are not a pilot. I'm having dinner with Ramon. He shoots fast and talks loud, but we're gonna need both of those skills to get this job done. He's a good choice for a digital shoot. Oh, I am going to miss the flatplan. - Mm, glossy paper. - Heft of a magazine. We could do movie nights on that thing. We could screen "Breakfast at Tiffany's." I'm thinking "Top Gun." Don't judge. Are you gonna be there Saturday? - Do you want me to be? - It'd be nice. Everyone jumps a little higher and faster when you are. - Well, then I'll be there. - Thanks. Hey, Oliver. Do you have a second to look at some of these running hijabs? Not at the moment, but speaking of running, I need you to make another one. - Is this a prescription? - Valium. I must when dining with Ramon. Got it. Flying out. I work so much harder than both of you. How you doin'? Totally fine, I could honestly do this all day. Ooh. However, I choose not to. Mm-hmm. It's okay, I do barre three times a week. Surprised? Annoyed. Oh, I have to go. It's okay, I'll just be right here. Good, stay there. All day. Yeah, of course the doormen are taking care of me. I love Roy. I'm just checking in, making sure you're okay. How's work? Oliver got you busy styling? Oh, yeah. Slammed. That's good. That's what you want, right? Yes. Listen, I gotta take this. Oh yeah, I gotta go too. Love you. Love you more. Sutton? Daphne, hi! Oh, my God, what are you doing here? - Oh, uh, I'm... - Oh. Never mind, I hate when people ask me that at the pharmacy. I know, right? Um, how are you? - Oh, my God, Sutton, so good. - Yeah? Yeah, you remember my asymmetrical jacket? Bloomingdale's is selling them. I'm on my third production run. That's amazing, wow. But what about you? What's new? Um, I'm engaged. Oh, my God. Congrats. Thank you, thanks. What about work? I mean, how's design? You were on fire. - Your fashion show was a huge hit. - Oh, um, I'm actually... I'm styling. Back to styling, so. Cool. Oliver Grayson? Oliver Grayson? Oliver Grayson. Isn't that your boss? Hmm? Oh! Yeah, I'm just, uh, just doing him a solid. Listen, it was so good to see you. - Yeah, you too. - Congratulations, I mean, wow. - See ya. - Bye. Okay, so, uh... We start with me getting into position like this, sitting cross-legged, and then you, uh, wrap your legs around me. Okay, um, clothes on or off? We start with our clothes on, uh, until we feel connected, and then the clothes can come off later if we're feeling ready for sex. Okay. Oh, hi. Hi. Okay. Can we just... Yeah. - All right. - Okay. - All right? - Mm-hmm. Uh, this is called yab-yum. - Yab-yum? - Yeah. Yab-yum. Sorry. Um... I feel kind of like a koala. - Okay, sorry. Um, I'm ready. Okay. - Okay. So the idea with this position is that it opens our hearts to each other. And we should try to feel each other's breath. As you breathe out, I breathe in. You breathe in, I breathe out. And out again. Eye contact. - Eye contact's important. - Mm-hmm. Eyes are the windows to the soul. Sorry, I blinked. - It's okay. - No, it's not. 'Cause if this was a staring contest I would lose. It's not. Look, Jane. I'm trying here. Yeah, I am... I am, too. - No, I... I know. - You know what? I'm just actually... I'm kind of hungry right now. So I'm... can't really focus when I'm hungry, so can we just try this after I get something to eat? Okay, sure. Kat, you keep eating this salad, you'll live forever. Happily, I did not have to post up on the kitchen for the extra cranberries this time. - Oh. - Edible proof that "See something, say something" works. Thank you. Um... I actually, I have something for you. Hm? You're running in the marathon. - Wha... - And if it's okay with you, I'd really love if "Scarlet" could profile you. We're doing this whole big thing. Oh, my God... Kat, how did you do this? I know a guy who knows a girl. Who's Carrie Morgan? Oh, you're gonna run as her on Sunday. She hurt her knee, so you're gonna take her place. Oh. Is that... Are you okay? Yeah, um... This is so nice, and I really appreciate it. But... I don't want to run as someone else. Oh, well I mean you wouldn't be running as someone else. We would still track you as Chloe Blair. This is just, um, you know, to get you in. Okay. This might sound silly, but it would really suck to have someone else's name on my chest when I ran. My life is still full of people telling me that I can't be me. Old friends, family. Even some doctors. How could I let running, my favorite activity, be something that won't accept me as me? Sorry, I just can't. Uh... I'm so sorry, Chloe. No, no, no, no, I... I'm just explaining. I know that you tried. Uh... oh, gosh, uh... I will see you later, Kat. So Chloe wouldn't take the bib? No, and I think I kind of offended her. How? Well, she needs to run as herself and her name is really important to her. I should've known that. Hmm. What? I see the face, Tiny Jane. What's the face about? I... I got called out about that whole black market thing, which was definitely an oversight, but it sounds like you got a little call out yourself. Mm, really? You're right. We both need to be better. We're woke. Okay, I'm only saying this because... "Scarlet" is the manual of the future, yes. What? Well, white girls really shouldn't use "woke." Yeah, no, you're right. It's appropriated from black culture, I got it. Even I can only say it 50% of the time, so. I'm a white girl with a problem, can we talk about it? - Yeah. - No. So what's going on? I think I made a mistake with my career. - Huh? - What do you mean? When I was designing, I had that cool fashion show, and Joanna Coles wanted me to make a dress for her. But you love styling. I do, but I'm not styling. I'm doing assistant work. You didn't make a mistake. It feels like I did, and it feels like being engaged to Richard just makes it worse. Well, why don't you talk to Oliver about styling more? - Because I can't. - Why not? He loves you. I know, but that's why I can't ask him. He's been so good to me. I don't want to be a whiny millennial. Hey, you are not a whiny millennial. You are amazing, and you're just figuring it out. Just ask Oliver, push him a little. He'll understand. Maybe. Thank you, Jane. See, why can I look you in the eyes, no problem, but with Ryan I just can't do it? - So tantric sex...? - Didn't work. No connection, no orgasm. It was just... I don't know, but it was weird. What happened the night he kissed that girl? I don't know. Ask him. Maybe you're imagining the worst, even if it doesn't exist. Okay, so this is Kira. She was born sightless. She's gonna be running with her mom. Anahee is the first woman in her tribe to qualify. And Mira is 16, and she just raised $100,000 for new water in Flint, Michigan. - These are great, Kat. - Thanks. I really want to thank you for how you've embraced the new "Scarlet." Well, since I lost the election, it's a different way for me to help people. Do you think that we could push their photo shoot live on our social platforms? And drive more traffic to the website? Probably. - That'll be helpful. - Sure. Honestly, I've never really been that into the marathon. I mean, I walk on a treadmill. But now, seeing these women? I want to watch it. Yeah, I think a lot of people might feel that way. Jacqueline? Sorry, I have Ian. Okay. Thanks, Kat. Thank you. - Hi. - Hey, I got your text. What's up? Oh, we have a massive photo shoot here on Saturday during your luncheon, and I need to be here. Ah, okay. But I was thinking that since the boys already cleared their schedule that you guys should just come in and we could go to the lunch together? We get to watch you work. And we get to your luncheon on time, it's a win-win. All right, I'll tell the boys. Okay, great. Looking forward to it. Thanks for meeting me. So? What's up? Um, well, I realized I never asked you what happened the night you kissed that girl. Uh, I didn't know how much you wanted to talk about it. I know, but, um... maybe we should. It could help us. Okay. Well, um... I had a reading that night. It went well, I guess. The publisher set up this "come meet the author after drinks" thing in the lobby. Everybody was buying me drinks, shots. I got incredibly drunk. And? There was this woman. She said she wanted to be an author or something. She kept asking me questions about "Roaming." What was her name? Uh... Alana...? Something, I don't even know her last name, Jane. And then what? Uh... then, uh, I was hammered. I wanted to go to bed, so I headed for the elevator and she followed me. She was still talking to me about my book. Next thing I know, she was kissing me. Did you kiss her back? Yeah. Okay, um... and then? Then I felt terrible. That's why I called you. She meant nothing to me. It was such a stupid mistake and I regret it every single day. I hope you believe that. I do. I do. Come over tomorrow night. Okay, why? Because Alex is there tonight but he won't be tomorrow. And I want the whole apartment because I have a tantric sex article to finish. Okay. Thank you so much for meeting with me. I know how busy you must be prepping for the race this weekend. I have time. We have to close 26 miles of road for a marathon with 100,000 people. Yes, people of all colors and sexual orientations and abilities and actually, that is what "Scarlet" is gonna be highlighting, profiling these runners. We're gonna be promoting them on Instagram and giving them GoPros so that our three million readers can follow them, you know, as they race. Three million? I like this idea. I thought you might, and there's actually one more person that I would like to include. She's trans, she's fantastic, and she ran her qualifying race as a woman, but unfortunately, the paperwork said she was a man. So, uh... Ms. Edison, the marathon is a massive operation with rules. Yes, and it's also an event that allows anyone as long as they work hard enough to compete, and that's what makes it so great. It's what our three million readers love about it, and it's what I love about it. So don't you want people to love it even more? I can't authorize this myself. You have any more information on her? An article? Uh, actually I can do you one better. We're gonna be creating a profile for her tomorrow at a photo shoot so I can just send that to you ASAP. All right, make it good. I'll see what I can do. Great. Love it. Thank you. _ _ Okay. That looks great. Hey, Ramon. Here we go. - Um... hi. - Brian, give me two minutes. Okay, who's your runner crush? Ooh, Caster Semenya. She's so hot. Favorite training music? Um, my favorite training music is Skip Marley. Inspirational messages and driving beats. And finally, why do you love to run? Running is how I go out into the world and celebrate who I am. Oh, I love it, Chloe. It's perfect. I'm gonna send it to the marathon committee right now. Awesome, thank you. - Hey. - Oh, hey. Here are three potential looks. - Ooh. - Oh, tomorrow... You have to wear your favorite look for the race. - Thanks. - No problem. Brad, I'm literally running and you're just standing there and chatting? Uh, not anymore. Do you have a second? That was stupid. Um, listen. You know that I love working for you and that I think my leaving design - was the right choice. - As do I. And you said that if I came in really early today I could style a few looks, and I did that. It's just I feel like I'm... You're doing a lot of scut work, right? Yes. So I was thinking what if we hire a second assistant and then I can help you even more. Why do you think "Scarlet" went digital in the first place? Money is tight. I was told that there's a hiring freeze in most of the departments. So right now you are my assistant and I need assistants, so... can we please get back to work? Copy that, just... Hey, look. The next career step for you is a promotion to stylist, which I would love to make happen but that's gonna be really hard right now, so hang in there. I'm sorry. And I'm also sorry to tell you that crafting needs more orange juice. Hi. Not gonna use any of these. Jacqueline, Jacqueline. Sorry. Website traffic is up 12%. It's this photo shoot. I knew it was a good idea. Set up a meeting for Monday with RJ. We will be dining on this information. Oh. Hi! All right, get some snacks. - Hi. - Hi. So, ETD? Uh, well, Oliver's a little frazzled so let me work with him a little and then... - and then we'll go. - Yeah, okay. Terrific. Hey, hi. Did you really come all the way to this shoot to lose at flip cup? Why would you think that you could beat me, Andrew? Well, I went to college, Alex. So did I. Oh, were you your fraternity's pledge master... as a junior? Who are you? That's not even possible. You bet your ass it is. I was a barback in Amagansett when I was an AP stringer. Played for meals. And we put beer in the cups. - Hey. - Hi. So, we sent your profile to one of the people on the marathon committee. And? They just want to see one more interview. - Ugh. - I know, so annoying. Okay, okay. - You ready? - Mm-hmm. Okay. They would like to know how excited you are to be running in this year's marathon as Chloe Blair. Wait. What? - Wait, I'm in? - Yeah. Are you serious? Wait, I'm in? You're in, Chloe Blair. Ahh! Can I hug you? Are we there yet? Come on... So, it's been a while. Yeah. - I can do this, I'm okay. - I know. - But you're not. - I'm apparently not. Well, do you want me to? Uh, I don't think it'll help. Is there anything I can do, or? I just, uh... I guess I'm in my head now. Okay. I mean, is it that big of a deal? So Ryan couldn't get it up. It happens. - Hey! - Yeah, all right! Actually it is, because it was the first time ever, and it was right after I was starting to feel really connected. It just... I don't know. Feels like we're broken. Whoo, running. Well, you might be broken, but I'm just broke on my assistant salary. And this vodka is my drinks budget for the entire month. Mmm. - Hey, she's running! - Yeah. But at least you live in a fancy apartment. Yeah, that makes me feel like an even bigger loser. - Look at these people. - Yeah. I know, they're incredible. Yes, Jaime! You got this, Jaime! It might be "Hi-me." - What? - I'm just saying, he might want to be called by the right name. Okay, should I just, like, not cheer ever? Oh, my gosh, there she is! Hey, Chloe! Hi! - Hello. - Hey. Oh, you're wearing the outfit I styled for you. Oh, yeah. Well, I'm glad you did. It's killer. - So good. - Oh, thank you. I am so blown away by you and all of these people. Oh, thanks. - I am where I am because of Kat. - No, no. You're where you are because of you. Aw, well, it's been a long journey, and there's a lot more to go. You mean transitioning? You know, becoming who you are? I think she means running. Actually, I meant all of it. See, I was kinda right. All right, what is this cis girl nonsense? - Oh, it's nothing. - It's... we're fine. Oh, my God. Is this a woke-off? I can't say that word, but you can, and yes, it is. Well, my two cents? I think that as long as our hearts are in the right place and we're trying to make things better, that's good. Oh, I'm losing ground. See ya. Bye. - I love that, you know? - Yeah. As long as we're trying to make things better? That should be in the manual. As long as people are trying to make things better... - Then that's good. - Yeah. Yes, because life is a marathon and we gotta run it. What? Come on, we always say we're gonna run it and we never run it, so let's run it. Well, that's because it's long and hard. You wanna know something? There's lots of things in life that are long and hard except pinstripes... peenstripe! Too soon. It's not a good reason to not do it, you know what I'm saying? Isn't it, though? Some things take time, like getting my fashion career off the ground and you figuring stuff out with Ryan. But that's not a reason to give up! My man! Okay, I'm feeling inspired. Let's run a marathon. We're running a marathon. - We're doing it. - Twist. - Help me up. - And me, I don't care. Hey, look out! - She was so fast. - Oh, my God. That was scary, you guys. It feels like a next year kind of thing. Yeah, totally next year. I'm gonna do it next year. Me, Kat, and Jane. Yeah, we ran the marathon. - Really? - Okay, you know what? I'm not going to be cross-examined like this. Well, I'm just glad to hear that you're doing okay. It makes me very happy. Yeah, I'm, uh... I'm okay. What's wrong? Nothing... nothing... nothing's wrong, everything's great. It's just, uh, work is a lot, and I really miss you. I miss you, too. Hey, we closed another deal. It's a renewable energy software company. Oh, my gosh. Amazing. Um... hey, the girls just walked in. - Can I call you back? - Tell him I love him. Hi, girls. Everybody loves you. But I love you more. - Hey, baby. - Hi. - Question. - Mm-hmm? Did you or did you not style this look? Oh, wow. Look at that. I did. - It's kind of amazing, Sutton. - Thank you. Yeah, you should be doing that here. Yeah, well, there's a hiring freeze, so. But Oliver did say that he wanted to promote you. He just can't. So why don't you just help him out and make yourself more promotable? How do I do that? Fold faster? No, actually, we were thinking more along the lines of make yourself a brand. Influence a little, get a bunch of Instagram followers. Safford, they love that. - They eat it up. - Yes! Okay, a fashion influencer? I feel like this is a great idea. Think about it. Sutton Brady, fashion influencer. No, I don't know how to do that. Well, I do, and I know exactly what you should say. And don't listen to Jane, okay? She doesn't know anything. So I'm gonna go. It's official. We are running the marathon next year, 100%. So gonna need to get in shape. Wanna train with us? You know what? I feel pretty safe saying yes. So, uh, I read your article about our tantric sex. And? What'd you think? I noticed you didn't include everything. No. But I included the important things. Oh. Which were? Well, since you asked, um... I don't know, that we're working through some stuff and it might take a while, but that's okay 'cause... this is a marathon. I left a detailed calendar of the boys' activities in the kitchen. You won't have to do much. Margaret's got it all handled. Oh, okay. Good, good. Oh, bringing the blue shirt. Yep. You planning on going out? I'd like to. Have a little fun for a change. How unhappy are you with our marriage, Ian? I think about as unhappy as you, Jacqueline. Right. - synced and corrected by sot26 -
