 Previously on "The Bold Type"... - Richard? You're here. - I came here to see you. It's always been you. You ready? Let's do this. Where's Adena? She's not coming. I didn't realize the fight was that bad. She said that she needs more space to be creative. Being with me limits her. I figure if "Safford" wants to punish me for publishing an article about women's health in their signature woman's magazine, I say have at it.

 Jacqueline must have really pissed the board off because I'm looking at a short list to replace her. I still can't believe you have two guys fighting over you! If you got really good news, who would you call first? Ryan or Ben? Do you think you know? Yeah. I do. Right there. That was amazing. Was? Are we done? - No. - Good. Oh, my God.

 I don't have clothes for work. Just wear what you wore yesterday. I can't! I have to go! No, no, no... or... Maybe you just move in. Are you... serious? Yeah! It's been a month. We're doing good, right? Yeah. So? What do you say? Um... it's a... that's a big step. Kind of the idea. What do you say? Um... can I think about it? Of course. Okay. No, no, no, no! You know what? I have two more minutes. Ah! I still feel responsible. If I hadn't pushed Jacqueline to publish my article calling out "Safford," there would be no new head of digital and no office pool betting who it is. It's definitely that woman from "Yes, Girl." I had Alex put 20 bucks on it for me. Why do you insist on walking around naked? Because I know that secretly you love it. Hmm? Tell me I'm wrong. - Go grab me some coffee. - Okay. Oh, also, will you grab my laptop? Sure. You should try it, you know? It's really... it's quite liberating. Hello! Wow. Uh... Okay, well... Sorry, I'm not laughing at you. I know. I'm just gonna... This is what you get. Mm-hmm. Nice, right? You saw Pinstripe's peen-stripe? I did. I saw the not-so-weeny peeny. - Hey! - Oh, my God! Until he covered it up with a photo of Ben's face from "Scarlet" magazine. Wait, what are you talking about? Somebody was doing a little reading up on Ben. Oh. Seller's remorse? I wasn't reading it. Look, Ben is great, but... after he learned about my BRCA status, it got complicated, and we never recovered. - It just wasn't right - Yeah. Everything okay? Yeah. No, I'm just, uh... I've been so busy with work, I forgot to send Adena's stuff back. Uh, what's with the tote bag? Is that all you're bringing to Richard's? Yeah, why didn't you pack more clothes? Eh... you know. What? Richard asked me to move in with him. Wow. That's so great. So great. So great. Yeah, well, I mean, I told him I had to think about it, you know? - Yeah. - Absolutely. Obviously, if I did move in with him, I would pay rent until you found somebody else. I appreciate that. I mean, I'm not saying that I will move out, but... You should. If you want to. Oh, my God! - Oh, God. - You okay? - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm all right. - What were you doing? - Jane! This is not a bike lane! I was riding with the flow of traffic, so that's totally legal, but thank you. At least I'll have a good story for my first day. Your first day? I would have thought you've made tons of weed deliveries by now. No, that was my high school job. I'm sorry, are you Patrick Duchand? I don't care who this is. You should be riding in the bike lane. Jane. It's his first day. - His first day with... - "Scarlet" magazine. I'm the head of the dot-com. They chose a man to run digital at a woman's magazine? Is this 'cause you're moving out? I haven't even decided yet. Really thought you gals would be talking about Patrick Duchand. We are. And we are not happy. I mean, things change all the time, so you can either fight it or embrace it. I'm choosing to embrace it. That guy's, like, 15. And he wasn't in the office pool. Look, I'll get you your money back. Jacqueline must be livid. Hey, staff meeting in the bullpen. The bullpen? Yeah, it was Patrick's suggestion. Oh, my God, he's so cute. Okay, everyone! So, we have a very exciting opportunity to take our dot-com to the next level, and that opportunity is Patrick Duchand. He is going to be in charge of all digital content and really help make it stand out the same way that our print magazine already does. Now, as all of you know, tomorrow is our annual Scarlet Summit, where we open up the magazine to hundreds of "Scarlet" readers and influencers. We have incredible speakers. Our workshops and panels are completely sold out. And thanks to Patrick, his dear friend Betty Who is hosting a private concert. So, thank you, Patrick. - Yeah. - So it should be fun. Patrick, I'm sure you have a few words you'd like to say. - Thank you, Jacqueline. - Absolutely. Wow. I'm so psyched to be here. "Scarlet" was a big part of my sexual awakening. I used to wait until my big sister would fall asleep so I could walk into her room and steal it from her nightstand and fawn over the fashion pages. I should probably thank you for that, Oliver. My philosophy for the dot-com: be open. Right? Open your eyes, open your minds, and open your hearts. You see, the more open we are spiritually, the more open we become to new story ideas. That kind of thinking, it's what made me a success, and it's that kind of thinking that's gonna make everyone in this room a success. I don't believe in barriers, and I don't see hierarchy. - Can't argue with that. - Oh, that reminds me. I'd love to meet with each of you individually, okay? I'll find you! I have R.J. Safford on the line. Okay, I'll take that in my office. Actually, it's for Patrick. Oh, for Patrick? Yeah. Right, of course. That makes sense. Okay. That's all for now. Namaste. Namaste. - Jacqueline? - Oh, hi, Jane. Come on in. What's up? Um... This whole thing with Patrick never would have happened if I hadn't asked you to publish my article. Jane, this is not your fault. Patrick coming in is a culmination of so many things. So many things that culminated with me calling out "Safford" for their unfair health care policy. And I am really glad that you wrote that article. - Really? - Yes. And I'm even more glad that I published it. What we did together is amazing. We spoke up. We actually made change happen. And now you can afford to freeze your eggs. You're right. We have to give him a chance. Who knows, he could have some good ideas. Right. Thanks. Can you close my door on your way out? Mm-hmm. Alex, right? - Yeah. - Great to meet you, finally. - I've heard good things. - Okay. So, dude, it seems like you're, like, kind of underutilized around here. A straight guy working at a woman's magazine? I mean, that's... that's a solid home run. I bet you give a lot of free advice. Yeah, I could write my own column. That's genius. "Ask Alex" for the dot-com. You're brilliant. Dude, brilliant. Start sending me pitches? Uh, yeah. Jacqueline gave me a run-down of the digital team, and you have had an incredible year. I mean, look at you, changing policy to allow for diverse voices like Angie, and then... Yeah. Coming out with your fabulous Muslim artist girlfriend. It's incredible. I'm impressed. - Adena. - Mm-hmm. Right, yeah. Well, actually, she's not, um... in town at the moment. She's out of town. She's in Morocco at an artist retreat. Cool. Amazing. So is your "Free the Nipple" campaign, by the way. Thank you. But Kat, when I look up your personal social media, it's really lacking. It's crickets since Paris Fashion week. Well, you know, I've just been, uh, taking a bit of a social media hiatus. No, a digital detox for the head of social media, that can't happen. You're an extension of "Scarlet", right? Your job, your girlfriend, your access to clothes and parties and all things fabulous. Okay, well, I'll start posting on all my personal accounts. Yeah, I'm gonna tag you, and you're gonna get more followers, but Kat, please, you gotta keep the followership going up. Yeah, totally. Up! Jane. You got a minute? Sure, what's up? So, tell me, what do you want to write? I don't write for the dot-com. Unless Jacqueline asks for something specifically for digital. Right, got it. Old-school. No, that's cool, that's cool. I respect that. Um, but you know, until I find my full-time digital writer, it's kind of gotta be all hands on deck. It's an old-school term. Got it. But what interests you? Tell me. You know, it could be anything. I'm all about honesty. Well, if I'm being honest, I guess I'm interested to know why a man is running the digital portion of a woman's magazine. Wow. Yeah, I love that. - You do? - Yeah. Oh, no, totally. I mean, don't you think people are gonna be asking me that exact same question? But I feel like once they get to know me, they'll understand that I'm, like, the perfect guy for the job. You could be the one to help them get to know me. You want me to write a piece about you? I mean, yeah, if you're interested. And what if I find something that suggests that you're not the right person for the job? Hmm, well, a good reporter doesn't shy away from the truth. Cool. Well, I'll give you some names of people to interview. Oh, no need. I'll get people to talk. Old-school. Great, cool. Thanks, Jane. Hey. Oliver. So what does Patrick's fashion sense say about him? Sprezzatura. Sp-sprezza... hmm? The dark, denim jeans with the casual cuff, the bright, striped socks, the white Stans, the oxford button-down... sprezzatura. Perfect imperfection. Studied carelessness. Jumbo shrimp! It's an oxymoron. Are we not doing oxymorons? Sit down. He wants you to think he didn't put any effort in, when in actuality, everything is planned. Huh. That helps, thank you. Please tell your husband to call me when he wants to play golf. Yeah, you and Ian gotta get on the green. Last night was fun, wasn't it? It was. Thanks again, Marshall. Take care. - Hey! - Hey. Was Marshall's annual dinner last night? It turned into more of a welcome party for Patrick, but it was. Marshall said that you had other plans. No. We never got an invitation. I've been invited to that dinner for the past five years with a plus-one. You think this has anything to do with me dating Sutton? Um, I think maybe you announcing your coupledom at the Scarlet Soiree in Paris might have raised a few eyebrows, but... How about you? What about me? It's been a month, and you haven't said anything about me and Sutton. Well, I just... I just want you to be happy. But, of course, I thought you were happy with Jessica. Clearly, I was wrong about that. Jessica is a wonderful person. She is. I just hope that you're thinking clearly. I mean, it's been a really tough month for you, with your father passing, and... Jacqueline. Sutton and I have had feelings for each other long before my father passed away. What we have is very real. I'm glad to hear that. In fact, she's moving in with me. Really? Wow. Well, that's wonderful! I'm really happy for you. Thank you. - Kat. - Hi. Check your Instagram. Kerry Washington just followed you. So did Sheryl Sandberg. - Cool. - Hey, I have an idea. I want you to speak at the Scarlet Summit tomorrow. I'm sorry? Think about it, you have so much to draw from. Your rise to the top of social media here, your relationship with Adena, your experiences coming out. "Being Queer in the Digital Age." You'll find a good angle. Ooh, I'm excited. You're gonna be great! Uh, okay. - Hello, Andrew. - Please don't ask my opinion. Okay, I won't. Is Jacqueline around? - No. - Uh, Sutton. Come on in. Why am I even here? Just... go in. - Hey, Jacqueline. - Hey. So, for the Scarlet Summit, I've got JKOO and Givenchy for you. Great, just hang them on the rack. - Okay. - Oh, and Sutton. - Yeah? - Congratulations. On? Richard told me that the two of you are moving in together. Right. Oh. Um, yeah! Thank you. Honestly, I'm kind of shocked. I mean, I know you're used to making the final decision on things, but you can't make my final decision. No, of course not. Shouldn't have said anything, I was just being hopeful. I wasn't trying to take away your power or anything like that. Well, it kind of felt that way, standing in my boss's office, being congratulated for a decision that I didn't make. Sutton, I am so sorry. I know. How about we just... go home? Yeah, I think that's a good idea. I'm gonna go home. I'll see you tomorrow. So, did Sutton say anything about this morning? Are you seriously looking for a compliment? I'm not looking for an insult. No, she didn't say anything. And you can walk around naked all you want because she's probably moving out. Really? That's not the effect I usually have on women. Not 'cause of you, dummy. Richard asked her to move in. - Oh. - Yeah. Everything's changing. First, Patrick, now this. Well, there is a silver lining. What's that? We could walk around naked together. Have sex in every room. That sounds great. But I still need to find a roommate and dirt on Patrick. Ah. I found something. There's a gap in his work history. Okay. Lots of people have gaps in their work history. You just had a gap. I'm not a wunderkind. And it doesn't mention "Upright," but I know that he worked there when he did his TED Talks, so why erase it? - "Upright," huh? Hmm. - What? I have a friend who works at "Upright". - Call him. - I don't know. Please? Fine. All I'm gonna say is, be careful. This guy is pretty much your boss. I am so careful. I'm just a journalist, looking for a story. Right. Hey, dude, it's Ryan. Where are you headed? I'm just gonna go get a drink, I think. Wild Susan. Do you mind if I tag along? - To a lesbian bar? - That will work. Patrick assigned me a new column, and I need inspiration. All right, yeah. But you have to take a lot of Insta-stories with me. My first name is Insta-Stories. Okay, cool. So, "Upright." Uh, you worked there with Patrick Duchand? Sort of. The girl I hooked up with did. She's actually the reason he was fired. Wait, he was fired from "Upright"? For whipping his junk out at an HR meeting. You're kidding. Why? No idea. Me and Stacey didn't do much talking, though, so... Ah. Well, there's no time like the present. Um, I can't print this without confirmation. Of course. Thank you. Say hi to Ryan for me, okay? I will. Nice to meet you. Bye-bye, Patrick. Can I get two shots, please? Thank you. Ah, ooh, nope. We should snap this. Okay, ready? To more lesbian bars! To more lesbian bars! So wait, weren't you on a social media break? Was, yes, but then Patrick pointed out that I am an extension of the brand, and the brand is fabulous, so now I'm fabulous. - Thus, you are fantabulous. - Yeah. Should we go dance? Uh... okay. - Yeah. - All right. Uh, guys, I'll catch up with you. Jane? - Stacey? - Yeah. Um, thank you so much for meeting me. I know it's super last-minute. Do you want to sit? Yeah, sure. So, you knew Patrick? No, honestly, I didn't, which is why the whole thing was kind of crazy. Well, you never expect a coworker to pull down his pants, no matter how well you know them. - No, you don't. - Uh, so what happened? Honestly, it happened a long time ago, and I don't think it's really my story to tell. I understand, but, I mean, your voice matters, and you have the chance to stop the sexist behavior. Yeah. You're right. So, why did Patrick Duchand expose himself at a meeting? To prove that women deserve to be paid just as much as men for the same job. And he didn't, like, expose himself. He just dropped his pants. I don't understand. Well, Patrick and I had the same job, but he got all kinds of perks because he's a guy. You know, things like box seats at MSG, golfing with editors. And he was always saying it was bullshit. And then when he heard I was making a thousand less a month than he was, he decided to call a meeting with the both of us with HR. And they totally denied giving any kind of special treatment, which definitely pissed him off. And I was standing right next to him, and he screamed, "The only difference between me and Stacey is this," and he pulled down his pants. Yeah, it was crazy, but it was one of the nicest things anyone's ever done for me. I'm happy to hear that you're doing a story on him. He's a really great guy. Well, um, thank you for clarifying. Hi. Uh, can I get three vodkas? Thanks. Hey! Yes! Cheers! - Oh, my gosh, you're home. - Hello. Hi. What are you doing here? Oh, I just felt like being home. Where were you? Oh, you know, just trying to prove that Patrick is a sexist pig. But it turns out he publicly exposed himself to achieve gender equality, so... no dice. - Huh. Wow. - Yeah. Um, not complaining, but why are you here with me? This whole "moving in with Richard" thing... I think it's too soon. I don't want to lose this. Or this. Or this. Well, this will always be fine. But I'm happy to hear you say that. I want you to be happy, and I love you and Richard, but... yeah, I'm not ready for this chapter to end. Does that make me a bad friend? Yes. No. The only thing it makes you is honest. Well, you're welcome for my honesty. Thank you for your honesty. Oh. You can take that. I'm not leaving. Okay. Uh, hi. No, I got nothing. That's okay. Sutton's here. I'm gonna hang with her tonight. If that's cool. Okay. I'll talk to you tomorrow. So we never got a chance to talk about this morning. Scale of 1-10? I just want to say thank you. Hey, is this seat taken? Well, it turns out, I'm not exactly a hit at a lesbian bar, so no, it's all you. Oh, thank you. Can't believe you're not a hit. So how about you? Find anybody you like? No. No. You know, even when you were on social media, you never took this many selfies. Come on, Kat, what's going on? The truth. Well... You know that saying, "If you love someone, then set them free"? - Of course. - Yeah, well... I set Adena free, and then she didn't come back. And she's doing great. And then, today, I, uh, posted this old photo of the two of us, and she liked it, and I realized that... well, she's watching. So is that why we're here? To show Adena how great you're doing? M-maybe. Gosh. You are so hard on yourself. You got your heart broken. There's no expiration date on heartbreak. You move on when you're ready to move on, and when you are ready, you will find someone amazing. Someone who will never leave. You're such a good guy, Alex. Thanks, but it's true. Now, what do you say we get out of here? Yeah. Oop. Ooh, are you okay? Yeah. - That was weird. - What are you doing? Nope. Shouldn't have done it. Yeah. Let's, uh... I'm gonna get you home. - Okay. Thank you kindly. - Okay. - You sure you're good? - Yeah! I love "Scarlet" magazine! Hi. Hey! Thanks for setting my alarm. Figured you could use it. You okay? Not really. But I gotta go practice telling the world how fabulous I am. - For my speech. - Good luck with that. Thanks. - You'll kill it. - All right. - Jane, Sutton. - Oh! Hey, Patrick. - Hi. Betty Who. - Hi. - Hi. Sutton. - Nice to meet you. - Jane. Big fan. - Thank you. Jane, I read the article. It really works. You make me look good. So thank you. You're so welcome. - Nice to meet you. - See you, Patrick. Good to see you girls. Have fun. - You too! - Oh, he's not going anywhere. Oh, I'm sorry that you didn't find what you were looking for. It's okay. Hey. I had fun last night. So did I. There's Richard. I should probably go talk to him. I'm not gonna lie, I'm a little jealous. Sutton's great. I bet. Oh, come on. You gotta give me something. I mean, what is she, 26? And I bet she's flexible too. Listen, Eli, you are talking about my girlfriend, here. And she's smart, talented... And wildly flexible. I mean, he has no idea how flexible. - Mm. - And he never will. Oh, you're married. That's great. You should probably work on that. I got a feeling it's not going too well. It's nice to meet you, Sutton. So great to meet you. See you around. Wow. Ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the tenth annual Scarlet Summit. And our first speaker is our very own Kat Edison. Come on, Kat. Get up there! Good morning, "Scarlet." Oh! It's a great day to be queer. Isn't it a great day to be queer? We're so lucky to be alive right now. To be alive in a time where we're making such incredible strides forward as a community. We're challenging heteronormative ideas, we're fighting the patriarchy, and we are learning how to love one another and accept one another for exactly who we are. I'm so grateful. I'm so, so grateful to have a platform like "Scarlet," to... to share my journey with all of you and knowing that we're in it together. It's everything. Hey, you! - Hey, Kat. - Hey. Thank you for asking me to do that, it was amazing. - Was it? - Uh... Kat, anyone could have given that speech. Where were you? There was nothing specific in there. Well... it's hard to be specific when you're faking it. I don't... I'm not following. Before I met Adena, I was just a straight girl with commitment issues. Didn't expect to fall in love with her. But I did. And honestly, it was amazing. Until, uh, five weeks ago, when she broke up with me. In Paris. That's why I stopped posting on all of my personal accounts, because every time I tried, I would end up just looking through old photos of us, thinking about all the things I could've done better, wondering if I should've fought for her to stay, and, uh... then, last night, I tried to kiss a friend of mine because he said nice things to me at a time when I really needed to hear them, so I really don't think that I'm the fabulous face of "Scarlet" as much as I am just a hot mess. Is that specific enough for you? That should have been your speech. People don't want perfection, Kat. They want... this. They want honesty. Put your hands together, and give a red-hot "Scarlet" welcome to Betty Who. Hi, guys! I'm so happy to be here! Thank you for having me. ♪ 3:00 a.m., and all my friends ♪ ♪ Are looking at me sideways ♪ ♪ Give me a minute ♪ ♪ Maybe I'm too drunk and I'm not doing this ♪ ♪ The right way, but let me finish ♪ ♪ I'm so happy that you're happy with her ♪ ♪ Almost called you, tried to text you ♪ ♪ Like, a million times ♪ ♪ 3:00 a.m., but I don't care ♪ ♪ I had to tell you someday ♪ ♪ The way I'm feeling ♪ Where's Kat?

Why didn't you say anything? Because if I told either of you, then it would be real, and I wasn't ready for it to be real yet. It's okay. ♪ Do you ever think of me when you lean in to kiss her? ♪ Come on. Let's go.

Right here? You can just leave it there. Thank you. Anytime. Hey. Um, can I ask you a question? Sure. The thing that happened with Eli, does that happen often? Yeah, yeah, I guess it happens. It's a drag. I mean, two nights ago, it was Marshall's annual board dinner. We weren't invited. Oh. People just assume that this isn't... - Serious. - Right. And that's why you told Jacqueline that I was moving in with you. - That was so stupid. - No. It's not. I really get it. But the thing is... we just can't care what other people think. 'Cause I wasted a lot of time doing that. And I almost lost you because of it. It's just... harder than I thought it would be. We can handle it. You know why? 'Cause it's me and you against the world. And we're good, right? Right. Okay. So that was pretty ballsy, what you did at "Upright." No pun intended, I'm sure. Why didn't you share your story with the press? I signed an NDA. So I couldn't. - But I could. - Exactly. Look, Jane. I read your pieces. "Carry the Weight," "The Domino Effect"... you're good. Your work is thought-provoking, and it's honest, even when you don't like what you find. So you knew I would find your story? I knew a good reporter would find that story. Which reminds me, I found my new full-time writer. Well, I'm really happy for you. Welcome to the digital team, Jane. We're gonna have a lot of fun. We always post the perfect photo of ourselves, instead of showing what we're actually going through. So... This is the real me. Heartbroken. After breaking up with the only person that I've ever really loved. And my life is amazing, it really is. But that doesn't mean that I'm perfect. And it doesn't mean that I don't make mistakes sometimes. But... you know what? I'm... I'm getting there. I'm figuring it out. And I think it's about time that we started... being more real with one another. Sharing how we're actually feeling. And being there for one another. - I'm ready! - Okay, but I'm not. Jane, come on. It's just us here. Oh, that makes me happy. So, how do you feel? Mm... you're right, it's kind of liberating. - Right? - Mm-hmm. All right, it's your turn. Oh, finally! You don't have to worry about Ben. Uh... I know you were reading up on him. No, I was just... Hey. I chose you. I know. I just can't figure out how I got so lucky. Same. So Richard said that dumb thing because he was trying to defend your relationship? - Yeah. - Aww. - That's so sweet. - I know. Guess he's just figuring it out like I am. Like all of us. So, are you gonna move in, or... Uh... I think we're just gonna enjoy where we are right now, because... You know, once I... Look... Do whatever feels right for you. Please don't worry about me. I know! But what about all the in-between moments, like last night, when we were eating ice cream and talking about Pinstripe's peen-stripe? We will still have those moments. But seriously. If you want to move in with Richard, you should. I'll be fine. And the apartment's not going anywhere. You could come over whenever you want. So? What do you want to do? I want to move in with Richard. Oh, my God! Yeah! I can help you pack. I have a whole system. Yeah, I bet you do. All right, for now, can we just focus on, uh, packing up these boxes? - Yes. - Tape. - Yes. - Are you ready? Not at all, but... I have to move on. All right, where does this go? You know what? Just give me one second. We're really proud of you. Thanks. Feels good to be honest. And look at how many people you're inspiring. Subtitles by explosiveskull
