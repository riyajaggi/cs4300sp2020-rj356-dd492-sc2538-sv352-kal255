  - Previously   on "The Bold Type."  - Dating is a real minefield   these days.  - If you were dating a woman   who was rich,  would you let her  pay for everything?  - Yeah, if it made her happy.  - I am not looking for   anything serious right now. As long as I pick someone   that I have  no emotional connection to,  everything's gonna be fine.   It's just sex, you know?  - You said that there was   the possibility  of more verticals,   and I'm up for that challenge.

 - Well, let's see  how your next piece does.  - No wonder she pushed back   on my brilliant wedding pitch. Her marriage is falling apart. - Ian and I are separating.  - I'm sorry to hear that.  - It's not about   the uniform or Babs.  It's about me and Richard.  Oh, wow.  Oh, my God, I got tagged   in the "Scarlet" bridal shoot. - You're an influencer now.  [ambient music]  ? ?  - A vagina facial?  - Shh.

 - Sorry.  - Now, does the facial  come with a vagina massage?  Because if it does, I'm in.  - That's a different   kind of spa, honey.  - Yeah, I read that it's   supposed to give you  "the confidence and glow   you didn't know you needed,"  but that feels unnecessary,   you know?  - Is any of this necessary?  - Yes.  If I could,  I would live in a spa.  - Well, thank you   Sabrina George  for the free passes.  - Oh wait, stop, no spa pics.   It's too bougie.  - Shh.   - Sorry.  - So, Jane, how are you feeling  about that, uh,   wellness seminar, baby?  - Fine, nervous.  I just don't understand  why Jacqueline wants me  on a panel with a bunch  of CEOs and sex therapists.  - What are you talking about?  Your articles on that sex party   and tantric sex were great.  - And yet Jacqueline still  hasn't given me a vertical.  - Oh, she will.  - This is so nice.  - It really is.  - Hm, I had sex   with a dude last night.  - What?   - Get out.  all: Shh!  - Shh!  [upbeat music]  - So what does this mean?  - It means I was looking   for no-strings sex,  and with everything   that happened with Ellie,  I just decided to look for it   somewhere unexpected.  - Does this mean   you're not a lesbian? - I'd say emotionally, yes,  I've only had   feelings for women,  but I've always loved   having sex with dudes.  - It sounds like  your heart is a lesbian,  and your vagina is bisexual.  - Or I'm Kat,   lover of human beings.  - So are you gonna see  this human being again?  - Cody?   Uh, yeah.  He left his watch   at my place, so--  - Oh, classic.   - Aha.  - He left his watch.  - Oldest trick in the book.   He likes you.  - No, he likes having sex   with me.  Big difference.  - Mm-hmm.  - All right, I'm calling it.  Wellness time of death   is 9:00 a.m.  - I think I need to do   a little more research  since I'm gonna be sitting   on that wellness panel.  And Tinier Jane has been   working overtime with Ryan and needs a little R & R,  so think I might try   that "vagacial",  see what it's all about.  - Okay, have fun, Tinier Jane.  See you later.   - It's okay.  - How can you possibly think  that the Mets are better   than the Yankees?  - No, I didn't say better.   I said more loveable.  - More loveable--   what is more loveable  than a team that is   consistently excellent?  They've won 27 World Series--  - No, that's not love.   That is boring.  You know what love is?  It's drama and suspense   and hope and despair  all rolled up into one,  and that is the Mets.  - Wow, I think I just learned   so much about you.  - I once saw Derek Jeter   buy bananas at Whole Foods. Made my week.  [punchy music]  ? ?  - You need to go after her.  - What?  - Do you really think   Derek Jeter  buys his own groceries?  - I'm not writing   a missed connection.  - Well, if you don't write one,   I will.  - Look, I appreciate   that you're taking an interest  in my personal life,   but if I'm meant to see this woman again,   I'll meet her again. - [laughs]   No shit.  - That's weird.  - Andrew.  [quietly]  Who is that?  - [laughs]  - Oh, Dr. Alicia Golden.  - You look amazing as always.  - Well, thank you.  Oh, I am so glad this has   worked out for you to be  the keynote speaker   at our wellness seminar. Top neurosurgeon   at Columbia Hospital. - Any chance you're going  to the alumni mixer next week?  - Ugh, I wish I could.  My husband is working   in Ukraine,  so I've got the kids   and "Scarlet" and--  - Well, it is gonna be   a good one.  Chef Anita Lo is catering,  and Miles Shaw will be reading   from his new novel.  - Miles Shaw?  Wow, I have not heard   that name in forever.  - Was he in your class?  - One above.  Yeah, we dated, actually,   my junior year.  [laughs]  [warm ambient music]  ? ?  - What's the emergency?   - Oh, no.  Are you wearing   a pearl necklace?  - Yeah, not the fun kind.  - Okay, okay.   Why?  - Well, I had to switch   dinner with Richard's mom  to a Safford lunch   with Richard's mom  because of Oliver's schedule,   so what do we think?  - Is she June Cleaver?  - [sighs]  - Come on, honey,   just lose the cardigan,  unbutton your blouse,   and chill out.  She's cool, right?  - Yeah, I mean,  she's--you know, she's great,  but she's Richard's mom.   She's like a real mom.  I mean, no offense to Babs,  but this is the first time  we're hanging out alone, and I   really want her to like me.  It's fine.   I'm fine.  You know, everything's fine.  [high-pitched beeping]  - I gotta go, you know,   give the man his watch back.  - He left it on purpose.   - Okay.  [punchy beat]  ? ?  - Are you okay?  - Yeah, I'm fine.  - You will go on first,   of course, ten minutes.  And Kat,   our head of social media, will give you the guidelines   of how to promote the event,  and of course,   there's always Andrew if you have   any other questions.  ? ?  - Who is that guy over there?  - Her TED talk has  more than a million views.  - Wait, is that her with Oprah?  - If you don't ask her out,   I am going to.  - Really?  - Hey, I saw you   downstairs at the caf?.  - [laughs]   Yeah.  Yeah, that was me.   I'm Alex.  Alex Crawford.   - Alicia Golden.  But you already knew that.  [both chuckle]  Call me.  Let's get dinner.  [lively music]  [Alina Baraz's   "Lavender and velvet" plays]  - Hey.   What's up?  - My favorite customer.  - This is for you.  - Thank you, m'lady.  - Wow, had no idea  you were such a cheeseball.  - But totally endearing, right?  - Eh, if you wanna   call it that.  [laughter]  - Beautiful and sarcastic,   a deadly combination.  - Hmm.  Hey, uh, is there   any chance you  left that at my place   on purpose?  - No.   - Okay.  'Cause this is just sex.  - Yeah, I know.  I saw you break up   with that girl  right over there, remember?   - Mm.  - Ruthless.   - [laughs]  Got you laid though.  - ? I'll take you anywhere   you say ?  - So just sex.  - Mm-hmm.  - Any sex?  - ? I wanna give you   the world ?  - Come here.  ? ?  - ? Let my love run wild ?  - What do you want?   - Come here.  - [laughs]  - ? Let my love run wild ?  ? Let me,   let me love you down ?  ? Whoa, let my love... ?  - Maybe we could  change it up a bit.  - Hm, I like changing it up.  - I thought you would.  - What'd you have in mind?  - You could peg me.  - [quietly]   Uh.  I'm sorry, what?  - Since this is just sex,   and we're having fun,  I thought maybe you  could use your strap-on.  - Oh, I don't have a strap-on.  - Okay, I just assumed--  - Because I sleep with women,   I would have a strap-on?  No, that's not really   how it works,  and, you know, there's plenty   of other ways to get off.  - Oh, you know I know that.  - [laughs]  - I just assumed 'cause  you're like this powerful boss  that you'd enjoy  being dominant.  - Yeah, honestly, it's more of   a boss in the boardroom,  bottom in the bedroom   kind of situation.  But thanks for the offer.  - [laughs]  - I'm--I'm gonna have to go   back to work, though, so...  - Listen,  like, peg or no peg, I still  really wanna see you again.  - Yeah, me too.  - Just for sex.  - Absolutely.  ? ?  - ? Let my love run wild ?  ? ?  - I'm so sorry  for having to change the plan.  - Oh, no, no,   please don't worry. You're a busy woman.  I know 'cause I follow you   on instant gram.  - Oh.  [laughs]  It's actually Instagram,  but I like your way better.  And thank you,  every like counts.  - Well, I guess we all   like to be liked.  - Well, for me,  it's actually more about work.  - Oh, so this is part   of your assistance job?  - Uh, no, influencing is  actually a means to an end.  I'm trying to use it  to get a promotion.  - So if I understand correctly,   you take photos,  you post them,   and then what?  - The more likes  and followers that I get,  the more influence I have.  - Influence over what?  - My--my followers.  - Oh, so you want them   to follow you  so that you can go and get   a promotion to what?  Oh, I'm sorry,   am I interrogating you? - No, not at all.  These are great questions.  I guess the whole point is  for me to influence the people  who follow me to buy the things   that I post about,  so that the people at "Scarlet"   see me as being a commodity.  - So you're a saleswoman.  [punchy beat]  - More of a brand,   or trying to be.  - Well, it all seems   a bit silly to me,  but what do I know?  Let's have a look   at some wedding venues. - Hi, Dr. Gerard, thank you   for calling me back.  - Sure.   What's going on?  - I need some advice again.  I went to the spa today...   - Uh-huh.  - And I decided to get   a vagina facial,  and something   doesn't feel right.  I know that having BRCA   makes you more prone  to get cervical cancer, so--  - Jane, it just sounds   like this facial  threw your pH levels off.  It's really nothing   to worry about.  - Are you sure?  - Mm-hmm, yep.   - Okay.  - Just don't be alarmed   if you experience  a slight discharge or odor   in the next few days.  - Excuse me?  - What kind of odor  are we talking about?  - Just your basic vaginal odor.  Jane, it's not a given.  It's just a possibility.   You'll be fine.  Listen, if you wanna come by   my office in the next few days for a quick checkup,   my door is always open.  Oh, and Jane,   facials--for the face.  - Yeah, got it.  Thank you.  [punchy music]  ? ?  - Hey.  - Cody asked me to peg him.  - What?   - Yeah.  - How?  - You put on a strap-on,   and then you just--  - Well, I know what pegging is.  I was just more so asking,  like, how do you ask someone  you barely know to peg you?  - Leave your watch   at their place,  and then when they drop it off,   you say "Hey, wanna peg?"  - Hm, impressive.   - Yeah.  - What'd you say?   - I said no.  - Jane, come on, you know   I've never liked being dominant in the bedroom,   and I'm not very good at it. That's just not for me.  - I feel like  this is different.  This is a dude.  Yeah.  - What--what are you doing?   Where are you going?  We're gonna go check out   the strap-ons  at the Pleasure Porium.  - Why?  Are you gonna peg Ryan?  - No, but you might peg Cody.   - I'm not gonna--  - So I think that we should go   and check out all your options  before you make   a rash decision.  - Jane, I'm not gonna peg him.  [lively music]  - Totally fine.   Whatever you say.  But, you know, you might.  - All right, fine,   we can go shopping.  - [laughs]  - But it doesn't mean anything,   and text Sutton.  She'll be pissed  if she misses this.  You okay?   - Yeah, I'm just excited.  - So, where are you two going?  - You always wait a day   before you text.  - No.  Why do men think games work?  - Because they do?  - No, not on women like Alicia.  A woman like that  knows what she wants,  and that is you.  So call her.  [electronic beat]  - [sighs]  ? ?  - There, now how long   do you think  it's gonna take for her   to text me back?  [phone chimes]  That was fast.  - I love this woman so much.   You should take her to Lupe's. - Mm--  [phone chimes]  She wants to go to Kokana.  - I heard that place   is amazing.  - Yeah, but it's also booked up   for, like, a month.  I'm just gonna suggest Lupe's.  [phone chimes]  She's got Kokana.   7:30 tonight.  - Now that is how   the game is played.  ? ?  [hip-hop music]  Wow, look at all these   strap-ons.  - Is that a vein?   - Mm-hmm.  - How do you choose?  - Maybe it's like   a "Harry Potter" situation.  The strap-on chooses you.  - No, I mean, like,   what do you value?  Length or girth?  - Mm, you know,   as the receiver,  I've always been   more of a girth girl.  - Right.  - But I feel like,   as the giver,  which is still   a hypothetical by the way...  - Mm-hmm.  - It's probably length, yeah.   - Hm.  - What about ethnicity?  Would you say your member  is more African-American,   Caucasian--  - Mm, the flesh-colored ones   are kind of scary.  - Yeah.   - Yeah.  - I think,   if I were gonna buy one,  it'd be this one.  Look how cute it is.  [laughs]   - Pretty cute.  - See, it's not black.   It's not white.  It's not too masculine,   not too feminine.  It's got these cute, little   suspender straps  which I feel like would do   great things for my boobies,  and, um, you know.   It's just right.  Just Kat.   - Tiny Kat.  - Who are you calling Tiny?  - [chuckles]  - Hey, quick question,   do you think that they sell  anything here to get  the stick out of Claire's butt?  - Maybe.  [laughter]  Did lunch not go well?  - Uh, she thinks I'm a joke.  She kept asking me   what the point  of being an influencer is.  - Oh, well she   legit might not know.  - There was judgment.  - Mm-kay, well, what you   need to do is you need  to get a sponsor   for your wedding.  And that way you can show   old Claire how influential  her future daughter-in-law   really is.  What are you doing?   - You're buying this.  - What?   No, I'm not.  No, I am not.  - You have 14 days to return it   with a receipt.  - I haven't decided yet.  And how do you   know the return policy?  - Don't ask me questions.  Jane, are you coming?  - Uh, you guys go,   I'll catch up.  I'm just gonna   do some browsing.  - Oh, okay.  Do you think she's buying   a strap-on for her and Ryan?  - Maybe.   So proud.  [lively music]  ? ?  - Jacqueline, your 1:00 p.m.   is in the conference room.  - Good.  I want any information   you can find for me  on the novelist Miles Shaw.  I want a full download   tomorrow morning  before the wellness seminar.  - Oh, uh, that's a pretty busy   time for you.  Maybe we should j--   - We'll set up a call.  - Oh, sure, no problem.  ? ?  - Ryan.   [coughs]  No, I'm so sorry.   I think I need to stay in.  No, no, no, no, no, no.   [coughs]  Don't come over.   [coughs]  Okay, yeah, okay,   I love you too.  Bye.  [upbeat music]  ? ?  - Hi, this is Sutton Brady.   I'm an Instagram influencer.  I'm calling about sponsors  for my highly anticipated   upcoming wedding.  Thank you so much   for your time.  [phone chimes]  - ? I leave a blaze   when I'm moving ?  ? You'll see me first ?  - "Vaginal moisturizer   and lubricant."  "Vaginal perfume."  "Vaginal shea butter."  Who comes up with this stuff?  - Hi, I'm Sutton Brady.   I'm Instagram influencer.  Style by Sutton.   - Thank you for your t--  - ? I'm in control ?  ? Everywhere I go ?  ? I know, I know,   I know ?  - Hm.  - I am gonna sell   your product--hello?  Ugh.  [rock music]  - ? Everybody want   what I got ?  ? Look all you want... ?  - No, no.  ? ?  - Oh, thank--hello?   I--  ? ?  That wasn't very nice.  - ? I turn it out ?  - That's--I'm--anyway, I--  That one was fair.  ? ?  - ? Yeah ?  ? Everybody want what I got ?  ? Yeah, everybody want   what I got ?  ? ?  [spray bottle hisses]  - [screams]   No!  Ah, ah.  No, I did a bad thing.   I did a bad thing.  [punchy music]  - Hello.   - Hey.  - Hey, guys, uh,   need your help.  Think I broke Tinier Jane.  both: What?  - Okay, so you didn't buy   a strap-on for you and Ryan?  - What?   No.  - Oh.   - I--  oh, gosh,   this is so embarrassing.  Okay, I--   [clears throat]  after I got my "vagacial"--   - You got a yeast infection?  - Yes.   - Mm.  - And I was nervous   that it was gonna smell,  so I did something.  - You did all of the things.  - Mm, this one says  it makes your vagina  smell like  freshly baked cookies.  - But why?  - Because freshly baked cookies   is better than,  you know,   this situation.  - That's why I just bake  cookies and then eat 'em  when I get a yeast infection.  - That is   a million dollar idea. - What--I'm sorry.  Why did I not know  that you guys get   yeast infections?  - Well, it's not something you   necessarily advertise like,  "Hey, everybody,   my vagina's making yeast!" - Yeah,   but we're not everybody.  I mean, we were   more than comfortable  talking about   what strap-on Kat would be.  Why aren't we   comfortable talking about,  you know, our problems   down there?  - It's the patriarchy, bro.  Get in our heads,   messin' with it.  - I just--the patriarchy hurts,   okay?  I can barely sit.  How am I gonna sit   on that panel tomorrow?  That's gonna be impossible.  - Okay, I have a plan.  We're gonna go to Duane Reade.  We're gonna get you  some real medicine.  We are gonna get you   some ice packs.  - Boxers--medicine.  - Boxers?  - Yeah, gotta let Tinier Jane   breathe, you know?  [exhales]   - I know, like--  - Please stop doing that.  - [exhales loudly]   - St--ah!  Stop talking   about Tiny Jane breathing.  - Oh.  - What?  - Oh, nothing, it's just work.  [lively music]  - Oh, no.  The panel   is gonna be livestreamed.  - Ah.  [romantic pop music]  ? ?  - Here's the thing,   my dad was taking me  to Yankee games  before I could even walk.  He actually claims to be  the first black  season ticket holder.  - He's like the Jackie Robinson   of baseball tickets.  [laughter]  So "Scarlet" must be   an interesting place to work. - Yeah.  It was an adjustment coming  from "The Wall Street Journal,"  which was more my speed.  - Mm, believe it or not,   I actually like "Scarlet" more. - But I did some amazing work  covering the Bloomberg   administration,  and I got to do a great series   on New York mob bosses.  - That's cool.  - Don't get me wrong,  I love "Scarlet," but--  [phone vibrates]  - I'm sorry.   I have to take this. It's the hospital.  Dr. Golden here.  Sub-Q emphysema.  Yes, I'm at Kokana   across from Central Park. I'll meet them out front.  I'm being called into surgery.  A car's gonna be here   any second.  - Everything okay?  - [chuckles]   It's never okay when I'm being called,   unfortunately  - Stupid question.  - No, it's not stupid at all.  A diplomat from Australia   got in a car crash.  It's really serious.  I'm so sorry.  I hate to just leave you,   but they requested me, so--  - Oh, don't worry about it.   You're a surgeon.  People need you.  - Uh, can I call you later?  Maybe we can reschedule   for another night?  - That'd be great.  Oh, actually,  I'll take the bill.  - Dr. Golden   took care of it, sir.  Would you like this to go?  - No, I'm fine, thanks.  [rock music]  ? ?  - Guys, I can't even feel   Tinier Jane anymore.  - Here, here's this towel.  Put it between you   and the ice pack.  - How many times   have you done this?  - What's up?   - Too many.  - I won't ask.   - Thank you.  How was your date?  - Well, it wasn't boring.  - So do you think  you'll see her again?  - Actually, I don't think so.  I mean she's smart,   funny, good-looking,  and very successful.  - Why are you saying   that like it's a bad thing?  - Well, it's not bad,   just not great.  - Hm.   - Go on.  - Look, this is silly,   but I write articles  about dating while she   literally saves lives.  I just don't think   it's gonna work.  - So what I'm hearing is,   you're gonna walk away  from an incredible woman   because of your ego.  - What about all the stuff   that you said to me  about Richard, you know?  "Let him buy you   the sewing machine.  The power struggle   is in your head."  - That's different.   - Why, 'cause I'm a woman?  - That's not what I said.   - But that's what you meant.  - Why do I feel like   I need a lawyer?  - Maybe you do.  - Mm, I kinda get it.  But it's just fear.  You said that   this woman's great, right?  Cody's kind of great too,   but putting on a strap-on  and pegging him's really scary.  - I feel like   I missed something. - But it's scary  because it's different  than what we were taught   to expect.  Patriarchy has taught us  that men are supposed   to be powerful,  women are supposed   to be submissive.  That's it.  So you feel like less of a man   without your power,  and I feel like  less of a woman with it.  - Mm-hmm.  - But that's trash.  [electronic music]  Okay.  Okay, I'm gonna do it.  I'm gonna peg Cody.  - We goin' in!   - [laughs]  - Yeah,   I really missed something.  [upbeat electronic music]  - Ugh, I'm in more pain   than I was before.  - Oh, I'm sorry, baby.  It gets worse   before it gets better.  - Yeah, I just really hope   that the meds  the doctor prescribed   are gonna kick in soon.  - Just give it time.   - I don't have time.  The wellness panel   is in an hour.  I--I can't do it.  I can't sit in front  of people like this.  I have to tell Jacqueline.  How am I gonna tell her  that I have a yeast infection?  - [gasps]   Yes.  - Hm?  - I got my first sponsorship.  - Hey, she popped   her sponsorship cherry.  Special.  - Hogsmith Beer,   not my first choice, but I think Claire   will be impressed.  I'm seeing her later today.  We narrowed it down   to five venues.  - That's great.  Can we walk a little faster   just 'cause  I think it helps me?  Don't tell me you have  a yeast infection too.  - No.  - [gasps]   You're wearing the strap-on? - I'm hard packin', baby.  [laughter]  - No way.  - Yeah, strapped it   to my inner thigh  just to feel the energy   between my legs.  I'd really like to slap it   on RJ's boardroom table.  - So did you tell Cody   you wanna peg him?  - Sure did.   He's coming over tonight.  - Hey.  [punchy beat]  Jane, listen, it's no biggie.  Just walk in there,   maintain eye contact, and say, "Jacqueline,   I have a yeast infection." [laughter]   - Oh, no.  - Oh, and make sure   that Dr. Golden has  an updated itinerary.  - Jacqueline,   I have Miles Shaw on the line. - What?   Why?  - Because you asked me   to inquire about him  and told me   to set up a call? - A call for you and me,  so that you could share with me  whatever you  found out about him.  - Uh...  - Okay, just tell him   that I'm--  tell him I'm in a meeting.   - Oh, okay.  - And don't say when  or if I will call him back.  Go!   - Okay, sorry.  - Oh, my God.  Jane, hi, come in.   Please sit.  - Actually, I can't sit.   Uh--my--you know.  - Okay, then you just--  you--yeah, stand there.  So what's--what's up?  - I just wanted to tell you...  [lively music]  How...  Excited I am about  the wellness seminar and panel.  [chuckles]   Excited  - Well, that's good because   it's a really big deal,  and you're gonna   be great, Jane.  You're gonna be really great.  [laughs]  - Thank you.   - Okay.  Good luck.  - I love this place.  I think it's so beautiful.  - Oh, it's my least favorite,  but I suppose there's a certain   charm to its simplicity.  - Um...  oh, I have really good news.  So, thanks to my  Instagram hobby,  there's a company  that wants to sponsor  all of the beer  for the wedding.  It's called Hogsmith.   Isn't that great?  - Hogsmith.  - Yeah, it's not the best name,  but it's supposed to be   really good.  I'm really excited about it.  - I am happy to pay   for all the alcohol.  The champagne, the wine--you   don't have to settle for beer. We can do much better.  - I like beer.  Richard likes beer.  - I'm just saying,   why not the best?  - What if I think  beer is the best?  - Hogsmith?   - Yes.  I--I'm not a fancy champagne.  I'm a craft beer  from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.  I'm never gonna be   a fancy lawyer  with an Ivy League degree,   but I love Richard,  and Richard chose me.  Richard chose beer.  So...  [melancholic music]  I have to go.   I'm running late.  ? ?  [upbeat music]  - The culture of wellness   is defined by our attitudes.  But there's a distinction   between good health  and the absence of illness.  - How's it going   back there, Jane?  - Good health is objective...  - I'm sorry.   I know how gross this is.  - It's not gross.  Dudes go around  scratching their balls  like it's nothing all the time.  - Yeah, why do we have to   pretend like we don't  have the urge to   itch the bitch, you know? - Speaking   of Richard's mother,  was she really that bad?  - We both were.   I should probably apologize. - Bloating, fatigue,   low sex drive,  and so we look  to the wellness-industrial   complex for answers,  whether they are true...  - And that is the woman   who is responsible for this.  Sabrina George.  [sighs]  And I have to be   on a panel with her.  [laughs]   Yay.  - You don't have to talk   about your yeast infection. Just stick to the original plan   from before the "vagacial".  - [sighs]   Right.  I can do that.   I can do that.  [applause]  - Thank you.  - I'm gonna do that.  - Yeah.  - Sabrina George,   let's start with you.  Your spas are growing   throughout Manhattan.  And you've recently added  a "pampering your privates"   section  as well as a new line   of scented products.  - Yes.  Wellness starts at the top,   as we heard  from the incredible Dr. Golden,   and works its way down  to the bottom, which is where  we've been   focusing our efforts lately.  We believe that women should   feel confident down there.  - [clears throat]  - Jane Sloan, did you want   to say something?  - Um...  I--I was just gonna say, um,   I mean, why not  just use the word vagina?  I mean, why are we saying   "down there"?  We're all adults here.  - Um...  of course   we can say the word.  [laughs]  I just feel that most women  prefer synonyms or innuendos.  Makes things   a little less embarrassing.  Am I right, ladies?  [applause]  [soft dramatic music]  ? ?  - Thank you.  - Dr. Golden?  You were amazing up there.  - Thank you, and I'm so sorry   about last night.  - Oh, don't worry about that.   Everything's okay, right?  - Yeah, I mean, my patient's   got a long way to go,  but he's gonna be fine.  - That's great.  - And I'd love to  take you out to dinner again.  Make it up to you.  [tender pop music]  - I have a confession to make.  I find you intimidating.  You're amazing.  I mean, you're smart,   insanely successful.  As much as I want to be   the kind of guy who  isn't insecure about all that,   I don't know if I am.  - I get it.  You're not ready for me.  - [laughs]   I wish I was. - So do I.  - Our agenda has always been   to promote confidence and fun.  A dash of douche   makes the worries go down. - Well, that's all   the time we have.  Thank you so much, ladies.  - Oh, just before   you all leave,  I want you all to know   that the audience members are going home   with a Sabrina George gift package...  with all our latest therapies   for down there.  [excited chatter]  - Uh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,   wait, stop.  - Yes, Jane?  - I'm sorry, I just have to say  vaginas aren't supposed   to smell like cookies.  They're supposed to smell   like vaginas.  I mean, yeah, I said it.  Vagina.  While the wellness industry   may have an agenda  to prey on your insecurities,   I'm a writer,  so I have a "vagenda"   to tell it like it is.  Yesterday I used   Sabrina George's products  because I wanted   to pamper myself down there.  And if I'm   being honest with you,  I have   the worst yeast infection  I have ever had in my entire   life right now.  I mean, like, I should really   win a medal  for having to sit up here  for the past hour   without scratching.  [Oliva O'Brien's   "Love Myself"]  The point is, I'm tired   of women feeling like  they have to be embarrassed   about this stuff.  We need to start talking   about it  because vaginas   all have their issues.  So who's with me?  - ? Why am I like this,   can somebody please tell me? ? ? ?  - Since having kids, I  pee myself every time I laugh.  - ? Don't even know   who I wanna be ?  - I have a low-hanging labia.  I'm scheduled for   rejuvenating surgery next week even though I don't want it.  - I have acne on my vagina.  - ? I need to ?  ? I need to love myself   I need to, I need to ?  ? I need to love myself   I need to ?  ? I need to love myself   I need to love myself ?  ? Oh no ?  ? ?  - Claire,   what are you doing here?  - I want to apologize to you.  - Oh, no, I'm one who needs   to apologize.  I was being oversensitive.  - No, no, you weren't.  I had a tone; I felt it.  But I think it's because   I'm jealous of you.  - What?  - You know,  I loved raising Richard,  but I had to give up  my career to do it,  and letting go of my ambitions   is something  I still  regret to this day.  But you, Sutton, you're  a successful young woman.  [tender music]  - I'm not successful.   I'm just an assistant.  - An assistant on your way   to amazing things.  I can tell.  And clearly so can Richard.  ? ?  - Thanks.  I really miss him.  Long distance is hard.  - I know.  It's hard for me too.  But I am going to throw you two   the best wedding  that you can imagine,  and if it means Hogwash beer,  so be it.  Welcome to the family, Sutton.  - Thank you.  It's Hogsmith, though,   just in case you hashtag it. - I'm not gonna   hashtag it, sweetie. - Okay.  - [chuckles]  [Lykke Li's "neon" plays]  [romantic pop music]  - ? I never love half-hearted   I'm down to get bruised ?  ? Who's gonna let go hardest?   We fight and we lose ?  - What do you think?  - ? Another round,   another round in me, yeah ?  - I think you look beautiful.  - ? Knock me down   I don't care ?  - How do you feel?  - Hm...  Powerful.  - Good.  You are.  Are you ready?  - No, but...  - ? In the nights we glow   we glow ?  - Yeah.  - ? I'd rather cry all night,   night, night ?  ? Then let the feeling die,   die, die ?  ? Neon, neon, neon   I'm still holding on, neon ?  [Tala Parx's "I Want You"   plays ]  - ? Ooh ?  - It's gonna be fun.   I promise.  - ? Get your message ?  ? You won't just let me go   and let you down ?  ? I'm one of those   bad decisions ?  - I don't wanna hurt you.  - You won't.  I trust you, Kat.  - ? One keeps me grounded   and one in the clouds ?  ? Contradicting the things   I thought I knew ?  ? So indecisive,   don't know what to do ?  [both moaning]  ? ?  ? Can you really blame me   wanting you? ?  ? ?  ? And you, and you,   and you, and you ?  ? Can you really blame me? ?  ? ?  - I trust you too.  - ? So far from grounded   and close to the clouds ?  ? Contradicting the things   I thought I knew ?  ? So indecisive,   it's so hard to choose ?  ? ?  - Oh, my gosh,   you guys are so cute. - She actually loved   Hogsmith beer.  - Oh, Jane, Jacqueline   wants to see you.  [electronic music]  ? ?  - Jacqueline?  - Ah, good, Jane.  What you did yesterday   on the panel  was very brave and inspiring.  - Thank you.  And, miraculously,   I am feeling better down there. My vagina.  - [laughs]  Well, that is good to know.  - [laughs]  - And you know  what else is good?  - What?  - Your "vagenda" speech  caught the attention  of Forbes magazine.  Between that and your  great, honest work lately,  they are nominating you  as a possible candidate  for their "30 Under 30" issue.  Congratulations.  - You're serious?   - Yes.  Taking risks really pays off,   doesn't it?  - Yes it does.   Thank you so much. [soft dramatic music]  ? ?  - Andrew.   - Yeah, hi, hi.  - I'd like you  to get Miles Shaw  on the phone for me please.  - Miles Shaw on the phone.  - Yes, for real this time.  - On-on-on   the phone--on the phone. - Oh, my God,   how was it?  - Was it great?  - It was.  - Are you gonna do it again?   Are you, like, a pegger now?  - [laughs]  You know, it was different than   what I thought it would be.  - Different good or bad?  - Good.  Good, but--  - Butt indeed.  I'm just kidding, sorry.  I just had to.  - I just--I guess I just   thought it would be,  you know, sexual   and physical and primal.  - And it wasn't?  - No, it was, but it was   also intimate, you know?  And I don't know if that was   just because  I was in a place of power   and he was vulnerable,  or if I maybe caught a feeling,   or just, like,  half a feeling--   calm down.  But we connected.  You know?  Like, really connected,   like eye-contact.  - Mm.  - It was weird.  I've never had   that with a guy before.  - Well, it's like you said,  you're a lover of people.  - Yeah, yeah.  But I also think  that maybe it's more than that.  Um, maybe I might be bisexual?  And you guys know   I hate labels,  but this one feels important   right now  to own the space I'm in  and to make sense of it.  - If you need a label,   pick a label, any label.  - Thank you.  - Bisexual, lesbian,   queer, Kat--  we love all of them as long  as you're just being you.  - [laughs]  [Maggie Rogers'   "Back in My Body" plays]  - ? This time I know   I'm back in my body ?  [upbeat music]  ? ?
