 ♪ ♪
 76-year-old male.
 Cause of death: internal bleeding
 resulting from rupture
 of preexisting abdominal aortic aneurysm.
 Physiology otherwise un... remarkable.
 (buzzing)
 (whirring)
 (whirring stops)
 Brain: 1,230 grams.
 Normal.
 Are you mad?
 My father's wish is to be cremated.
 And he will be.
 All of him.
 Dr. Einstein,
 this is one
 of the most astonishing objects in the universe.
 Studying it could unlock the mystery of genius.
 Now,
 you are a man of science.
 He was a man of science.
 In the end,
 doesn't his brain belong to science, too?
 CROWD: ♪ Happy birthday ♪
 ♪ Dear Albert ♪
 ♪ Happy birthday to you. ♪
 Speech! - Speech!
 No, no, no, no.
 Yes, well, the person most bored to tears
 by my babbling is me.
 So I shall politely
 refrain and thank you all for coming.
 Thank you. Thank you.
 Thank you.
 I seem to have stumbled onto the wrong gathering.
 I was meant to attend a birthday party, not a funeral.
 Did you see what Halpern's wife asked me to sign?
 That? It's from last year.
 So what? It's my face on the cover of Time magazine
 in front of a mushroom cloud.
 It's a wonderful likeness.
 You're the one who actually built the damn thing.
 But, still, everybody blames me.
 Albert, we have quite a surprise in store for you.
 The only gift I want from you, Niels,
 is an admission that quantum mechanics is incomplete.
 (scoffs) What fun would that be?
 Yes, well, we have to find some other excuse for our squabbles.
 But the current situation is absurd.
 Reality cannot be described by two theories which do not agree.
 Unified field theory is not the answer though, Albert.
 It will be the final chapter in physics.
 You'll see. I will solve it before I die.
 Die? No, you'll never die. (chuckles)
 No, you'll be chiding post grads long after the sun
 has burned itself out.
 And besides, it's bad luck to be so morbid
 on one's own birthday.
 I have been trying to tell him that.
 Birthdays cause a man to reflect
 on what little he has accomplished.
 You have achieved more
 than almost anyone in human history.
 And yet, if I died tomorrow, I'd be remembered
 as the man who ushered in the nuclear age.
 Well, be happy with what you have accomplished, Albert.
 It's quite a lot.
 What are you looking for?
 My good name. It seems to have gone missing.
 (chuckles)
 I'm forming a council, Oppie.
 The Emergency Committee of Atomic Scientists.
 Albert, you have guests.
 Go enjoy yourself.
 If my legacy is to be tied to the atomic bomb,
 it will be for preventing its use.
 I need you to join me.
 I'm running the Institute now.
 I can't get involved in politics.
 What are you so worried about,
 the wrath of university administrators?
 I'm worried about Hoover.
 He probably knows what color socks I'm wearing right now.
 It's not safe for me.
 You? Don't be ridiculous.
 It's not safe for you either, Albert.
 Trust me.
 Aha. There you are.
 You are not to be smoking.
 Isn't this the one day I should be allowed to smoke?
 Come. Your grandchildren
 want to wish you a happy birthday.
 (speaking indistinctly)
 Papa.
 Are you enjoying my party, Evelyn?
 Yes, Grandpa.
 I'm pleased.
 Bernhard has some news he'd like to share with you...
 Oh. - Yes...
 (clinking) - BOHR: Professor Einstein.
 Professor.
 Please, everybody. (clears throat)
 Our young prodigy here, David Bohm,
 has helped assemble this high-fidelity radio.
 (oohing, applause)
 We all thought it was time to drag you
 kicking and screaming into the modern era.
 Many of us here today are the beneficiaries of
 your generosity.
 Some of us, like Dr. Oppenheimer,
 are colleagues who sharpen our minds
 coming up against yours.
 Others are
 former students whom you've treated with the...
 patience and selflessness of a father.
 (distorting): But all have blossomed...
 TEENAGE HANS: I told you this was a ridiculous idea.
 He isn't coming.
 The weather has delayed the trains. He may come yet.
 Eduard was the one who wanted
 to go traipsing through the Alps.
 And now he's terribly sick.
 Would you like to trade places with him?
 Your father has wanted a holiday with you
 for quite some time.
 You owe him at least that.
 Why do you make excuses for him?
 Because we all make excuses for ourselves,
 and we should be good enough to make them for others.
 People are complex.
 So?
 You're going to tell him then?
 I don't know.
 Mm, it would be one thing
 you both have in common.
 (applause) EINSTEIN: Thank you.
 Let's have a look at this. Come on.
 We're going. - Ah. - But Grandpa's present...
 Leave it.
 Oh. Huh.
 Ah.
 (chuckles)
 A few more items before you retire.
 The Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios are asking
 for your approval for the script they sent.
 Is it still a movie about the making of the atomic bomb?
 It is. - Then I do not approve.
 There are a number of speaking invitations:
 uh, Harvard, Cornell, University of Chicago...
 I've decided to accept only one.
 Lincoln University.
 Do you have an opinion on this matter?
 Of course not.
 You never do.
 EINSTEIN: The sun's gravitational pull
 is sufficient to bend light itself.
 And bend light it does.
 That is how I finally found proof
 of the theory of general relativity.
 Most scientists thought
 I was mad.
 Funny, isn't it, how progress can provoke
 such an emotional response?
 Though, of course,
 this idea is not foreign to most of you.
 Many believe that young men such as yourselves
 do not deserve the same opportunities as everyone else.
 All because of the color of your skin.
 How absurd.
 What do I know of it? After all,
 look at me. I'm an old white Jew with crazy hair.
 (laughter)
 But I, too, have been disparaged
 for how I look.
 For my heritage.
 We all share the same decent humanity.
 The same curiosity.
 Hopes, dreams.
 The same God.
 HOOVER: He consorts with dangerous types.
 Communists, Negroes, anarchists.
 I have to say, sir, I'm surprised
 Einstein is the target of an investigation.
 (chuckles)
 Einstein's office is already bugged,
 but I have decided to inject new blood
 into this case.
 That's why you're here.
 This could be a rewarding stepping stone
 for you, McKee.
 You'll be on the front lines in the next war.
 War, sir?
 Communism is an existential threat to our great republic,
 and Einstein is on the side of the enemy.
 Find what I need
 to put this son of a bitch in jail.
 Or...
 at least send him on a one-way trip
 back to Germany.
 Yes, sir.
 (door opens, closes)
 Is it worth it, Edgar?
 Going after the world's most famous scientist?
 Einstein humiliated me.
 Could've lost my job.
 I almost did lose my reputation.
 What is it that the scientists say, huh?
 For each action
 there is an equal
 and opposite reaction.
 Nuclear weapons are the obstacle to world peace,
 not its solution.
 But they exist.
 Well, I think the best way to ensure they're never used
 is to give control of them to the scientists who made them.
 Not the American military.
 You think the Red Army is going to leave
 the bomb to their scientists?
 Harold's right. The Soviets are mad. Which is why
 we must push for containment.
 That is a fantasy. - Exactly.
 The U.S. and the Soviets
 will continue to build their nuclear stockpiles.
 And perhaps they should.
 What the hell are you talking about, Leo? - Are you crazy?
 Perhaps what will ultimately save us
 is two superpowers with the ability
 to completely destroy
 one another.
 Atomic use leads to atomic retaliation
 and that retaliation leads to more retaliation
 and we end up at reciprocal annihilation.
 Which is why
 neither side will ever dare to use even one weapon.
 I cannot believe my ears.
 I'm sorry, Leo, but I cannot.
 That is lunacy.
 Whether by accident
 or idiocy or the will of a tyrant,
 these weapons will be used.
 And when they are, not even
 God can help us.
 What is it you suggest, Albert?
 A world government.
 It would sit on top
 of all existing nations
 and, as adjudicator
 in all disputes, would make world wars
 a thing of history.
 No nation would give up
 its sovereignty.
 We are dealing with a threat
 to the basic existence of humanity.
 In my own work, I find
 when I'm faced with an audacious problem,
 an audacious solution is usually the answer.
 So let's put our prodigious heads together
 and see what we can come up with.
 SECRETARY: Professor Bohm to see you?
 EINSTEIN: Of course.
 David, come in.
 I've just read your paper.
 It's remarkable.
 Well, hopefully it'll give you some ammunition
 to fire back at the quantum contingent.
 EINSTEIN: It does, and it came at just the right moment.
 I've been stalled
 on unified field theory for months.
 BOHM: So you'll recall the idea
 of hidden variables from my paper. - Ah.
 If we assume both a quantum particle, for example, (phone rings)
 an electron,
 and a guiding wave that governs its motion...
 (sighs) He's not at the office, either.
 HANS ALBERT: I've been admitted
 to Zurich Polytechnic.
 I'll be following in your footsteps.
 This is wonderful.
 This will be an extraordinary adventure.
 Engineering?
 But why?
 Engineering is the future, Papa.
 No.
 You've been sold a story.
 It isn't science.
 It's tinkering.
 Tinkering?
 Hans, trust me.
 This is beneath you.
 You have a gift. You've always excelled
 in science.
 Target your ambitions,
 and then aim higher.
 Engineering is my ambition.
 It isn't science, Hans.
 I don't want you
 to give up on science like your mother did.
 Give up?
 She sacrificed herself for all of us.
 For you, most of all.
 She's no martyr, Hans.
 She made her own choices.
 Don't squander your talents like she did.
 There are nobler pursuits for a brain like yours.
 No, you mean a brain like yours, Papa.
 I want to do something different.
 Ah. It's days like today, Helen, that I'm reminded
 that science is primitive and childlike.
 Thank God for that.
 What is it?
 Thank you.
 I'm sorry for your loss, my boy.
 My loss?
 That's an interesting way to put it.
 Tell me, what were you doing earlier?
 Before I arrived.
 I was working.
 And yesterday when I couldn't reach you?
 I was at the office.
 No, I called the office.
 There was no answer.
 There are moments when I get absorbed
 in what I'm doing, Hans. You know that.
 Yes, I certainly do.
 But I have always hoped that once--
 just once in my life--
 you'd be absorbed with your family
 instead of your work.
 But we're just a burden to you.
 That's not fair, Hans. - Isn't it?
 I think you're relieved she's dead.
 How could you say such a thing?
 You'll never again have to worry about her money problems
 or feel guilt for what became of her.
 I thought we had put aside all this bitterness years ago.
 That is because you are completely oblivious
 to the feelings of those closest to you, Papa.
 You're so kind to so many people.
 But you have been so cruel
 to your own family.
 I have accepted a teaching position at Berkeley.
 We won't have to see each other again.
 Hans, wait.
 Don't leave like this.
 Not today.
 You treated her miserably,
 and you should be ashamed.
 I'm only angry with myself
 for taking this long to say that to your face.
 Don't contact me, Papa.
 Ever.
 The neutron itself was discovered
 by Chadwick, an Englishman.
 The cyclotron by Lawrence, an American.
 And the splitting of uranium
 was detected by Hahn, a German.
 Don't blame it all on me.
 MAN: Would it be possible for you
 to go and see President Roosevelt yourself?
 But I have a cold. And besides,
 I do not know
 Mr. Roosevelt very well.
 I'm sure the president knows you, sir.
 EINSTEIN: It will be more polite
 if I just write him a letter.
 MAN: Thank you, sir.
 EINSTEIN: The acting was abominable.
 The science, completely wrong.
 And I don't really talk like that, do I?
 Well, at least they implemented
 some of the changes you proposed.
 Well, to my mind, it certainly didn't improve...
 Oh. - Professor?
 (grunts)
 The pain is likely due to an aneurysm of the aorta.
 Basically a small bulge in the artery.
 Is it serious?
 Not if he doesn't smoke, cuts out sweets
 and avoids strenuous activity.
 That does include sexual congress, Dr. Einstein.
 I see. To live long, I must forego
 anything worth living for.
 (chuckles)
 EINSTEIN: David.
 Where is everybody?
 They're terrified, Albert.
 Of what?
 This. It's a subpoena.
 The Un-American Activities Committee.
 What could be more un-American
 than an inquisition?
 I'm scared, Albert.
 You'll be all right, David.
 You have the First Amendment in this country.
 Stand up.
 Tell the truth. Say, "Yes, I was a communist."
 It is not illegal to have been one.
 And then what?
 I-I won't be able to get a job.
 I'll be ruined.
 They cannot force you to speak.
 MAN: Mr. Bohm,
 are you now, or have you ever been
 a member of the Communist Party?
 On the... (camera shutter clicks)
 On the advice of counsel,
 I invoke my right under the Fifth Amendment
 not to answer, on the grounds I may incriminate myself.
 (excited murmurs) Order! Order!
 How could those bastards suspend a man
 for attending a few meetings?
 You know it's out of my hands.
 I'll offer to pay his salary.
 He can be my personal assistant.
 Albert...
 If David Bohm sets foot on the Institute's grounds,
 he will be arrested for trespassing.
 And you and I will soon thereafter be
 polishing our résumés.
 The United States government
 sees Bohm as a threat,
 and no matter what its flaws...
 I still believe a man
 must put his country first.
 You are a coward. - Albert.
 This is a man's life.
 If we sit on our hands, they'll come after us next.
 They want to intimidate us into silence.
 That way we become easier prey.
 Don't do anything rash, Albert.
 Don't worry, whatever I do will be quite deliberate.
 You think it's foolish, I know.
 Yet again, I'm inviting controversy.
 So why not say it, just this once?
 You truly are a sphinx, Helen.
 Elsa had opinions, advice. Elsa had strategy.
 I am not Elsa.
 No, you certainly are not.
 The only thing you show enthusiasm for
 is keeping my pipe from me.
 You haven't seen it, have you?
 ELEANOR ROOSEVELT: Hello and welcome.
 I'm Eleanor Roosevelt.
 On today's program,
 I'll present a special segment
 from renowned physicist
 Albert Einstein.
 EINSTEIN: Good evening.
 The arms race between the United States
 and the Soviet Union
 has assumed hysterical proportions.
 On both sides, means of mass destruction
 are being perfected with feverish haste,
 and behind walls of secrecy.
 And now the production of the hydrogen bomb
 will be accomplished.
 If these efforts prove successful,
 annihilation of all life on Earth
 will have been brought within the range
 of what is possible.
 Outside the United States
 we establish military bases.
 Inside the United States...
 Inside the United States,
 the loyalty of citizens is carefully supervised
 by a police force growing more powerful every day.
 People of independent thought are being harassed.
 The public is indoctrinated.
 Get me McKee.
 With one television interview
 he humiliated the Bureau.
 We must move on him
 before he does more damage.
 I'm doing all I can, sir. - Do more.
 Search his mail, tap his home phone,
 follow his acquaintances.
 You have discretion to do
 whatever it takes.
 McKEE: I'm just wondering what evidence
 persuaded a judge to sign a warrant
 for such an extensive operation.
 We cannot wait
 on the slow wheels of justice.
 I'm not sure I understand, sir.
 Look at Bohm.
 Nobody would hire him after his hearing
 and now he's in Rio with diarrhea and a sunburn.
 (chuckles)
 And you can bet your Brazil nuts
 he spends every waking moment wondering,
 "Why did I stonewall the Bureau?"
 I have confidence...
 you'll get the results I need, McKee.
 (car door closes, engine starts)
 Until we are left
 with a unique modification to my previous
 "guiding wave" proposal,
 because this wave can influence a quantum particle
 without becoming... - Albert,
 we've been down this road many times. No, no, no, no, no, no.
 Yes. - This is different.
 It seems that the more the rest of physics accepts my work,
 the more you resist it.
 Because it's all conjecture.
 Where is your proof?
 Y-You sound just like one of those stodgy members
 of the establishment who said the same thing
 about general relativity...
 Are you actually comparing quantum mechanics
 with relativity?
 Albert, tell me,
 what do you have to show for all this time
 you've spent chasing unified field theory, huh?
 Perhaps,
 if you'd just let go of your ego
 for just a moment,
 you could admit that you're simply wrong.
 You're as bad as those fools in Washington,
 trying to ruin anyone who comes up against you.
 You think I'm trying to ruin you? You make me out to be
 a laughingstock, a has-been.
 Anyone who doesn't follow your decree,
 is a traitor or an imbecile,
 and I've had enough.
 Albert, you've lost yourself.
 Yes.
 Like one or your unobserved particles.
 I'm not even here.
 Albert.
 I think you should go.
 RADIO ANNOUNCER: This is a CBS news bulletin.
 Julius and Ethel Rosenberg have been found
 guilty of conspiracy to commit espionage.
 Under federal law, the Rosenbergs are eligible
 for the death penalty.
 EINSTEIN: A country which
 prides itself on freedom of speech
 must not commit the most barbarous act
 of retribution on those
 who disseminate information.
 That much, Your Honor,
 should be self-evident.
 Is that all?
 No.
 I'd like my pipe, please.
 It's the one thing left in this world that gives me pleasure.
 I cannot help you with that.
 As true as the moon pulling the tides,
 here we find ourselves again.
 You want to say my little controversies are pointless,
 but you will not say it.
 Silence again.
 Silence always.
 As though it were a virtue.
 It is no virtue, Helen.
 Pull the page and let me sign it.
 There are controversies,
 and then there is absolute stupidity.
 You do understand I'm speaking out
 against a clear wrong.
 Did you not ask my opinion?
 This isn't like speaking at a Negro college.
 This is about meddling in the affairs
 of the United States government.
 My own son will not speak to me.
 I'm made to feel like a dinosaur
 in the physics community.
 I've completely stalled
 on unified field theory.
 And I have no idea where my pipe is.
 I'm getting old, Helen.
 I'm sick.
 My voice is all I have left.
 ♪ ♪
 (Hoover chuckles)
 This is precisely what we need.
 Yes, sir.
 But we intercepted Einstein's letter
 before it reached the judge.
 Seeing as we don't have a warrant...
 Oh, be creative, McKee.
 Reseal the letter.
 Have it sent to the judge.
 Then pay him a visit.
 "Have you received correspondence
 from Albert Einstein?" you ask.
 "Whatever would give you such an idea?" he replies.
 "Confidential source, you answer.
 "But if you are a good American
 "and you believe in our institutions,
 "I'm sure you'll aid the Bureau in this quite sensitive matter
 of national interest."
 You want me to intimidate a federal judge?
 Who said anything about intimidating?
 There is no evidence of a crime here, sir.
 Has Einstein actually done anything illegal?
 Einstein is a fox.
 And we have him up a tree.
 It's time to pull the trigger.
 I'll find someone to make noise with that letter.
 CONGRESSMAN RANKIN: Here it is,
 in his own hand, a letter
 trying to influence a federal judge on behalf of spies
 and pinko subversives
 who delivered our closely-guarded atomic secrets
 right up the steps of the Kremlin.
 This so-called genius,
 he would replace the stars and stripes
 with a hammer and a sickle without breaking a sweat.
 Congressman Rankin, over here, sir.
 How did you come to be in possession of the letter?
 Judge Kaufman himself, a true patriot.
 Now, are there any other questions?
 HOOVER: The Washington Post, The Chicago Tribune,
 The Philadelphia Inquirer,
 even this commie rag
 has denounced him.
 You just earned yourself a promotion, McKee.
 (clears throat)
 Close the case.
 My assignment was to amass evidence
 and either charge him criminally
 or find grounds to have him deported.
 Have you assembled evidence
 so that I may charge Einstein? No.
 Have you brought me grounds by which I may deport him?
 Not yet, sir, but... Then you have failed.
 Men like Einstein
 confuse an unstable nation.
 And such confusion
 is as reprehensible
 and is as punishable as any other crime.
 So,
 I found a way to punish him.
 And this is it.
 Your solution is to humiliate a man?
 To silence him?
 Einstein has spoken out
 with impunity for years.
 It was time someone
 shoved a gag in that mouth.
 McKee.
 When you question the integrity of the Bureau's actions,
 you question the integrity of my actions.
 And such questions...
 they can get a man in a whole mess of trouble.
 (door opens, then closes)
 RADIO ANNOUNCER: Let Einstein speak out,
 and he'll be drowned by the patriotic citizens
 of this fine country.
 It takes a man a lifetime to build his reputation,
 and yet a mere moment to scuttle it.
 That's a version of relativity Dr. Einstein
 ought to have learned long ago.
 Perhaps now Einstein will retreat
 to the laboratory, where he belongs.
 In the meantime, all good citizens would do well
 to turn a deaf ear to his subversive screeds.
 We should instead pay attention to the patriots
 who have lived all their lives in this great country.

 Uh. Huh.
 HELEN: It's time to get out of the house.
 Is there somewhere I'm meant to be?
 Go to your office. You haven't been there in months.
 I haven't had an original thought for so long,
 I've forgotten what it feels like.
 If I went
 to my office, I'd only stare at the walls.
 The wallpaper is much nicer here.
 Helen?
 What's an eight-letter word that means "frozen treat"?
 P, something, P,
 something, something, something,
 something, something.
 I'm going to the market.
 Dr. Einstein,
 my name is Alice Edwards, and, well,
 you are the smartest man in history, sir.
 All the papers say so, and all
 that stuff you said about the universe and whatnot.
 Well, it's really important to kids all across America.
 And that's why your brain is critical
 in helping me with my long division, which...
 I have cookies.
 If you could kindly fill in the answers
 here, here and here,
 I'll work backwards and get the gist.
 That's kind of how I learn. Why do your teachers
 make you study mathematics?
 Exactly.
 What good is stupid math anyway?
 Here's a strange thing.
 Almost all flowers in nature have a certain number of petals:
 either five,
 eight, 13, 21,
 34 or 55.
 It's called the Fibonacci Sequence.
 Yikes.
 And the Fibonacci Sequence, in turn,
 (door squeaks open) is related to the Golden Mean.
 Sounds like
 an Agatha Christie book. - Ha.
 And who are you?
 My name is Alice Edwards, ma'am.
 Dr. Einstein was kind enough to help me with my long division.
 Well, Miss Edwards,
 Dr. Einstein
 isn't taking visitors at the moment,
 despite his willingness
 to accept bribes.
 Out with you. Come.
 Gee, she's a real charmer.
 I wish my teachers were more like you.
 You make this stuff sound fun.
 It is fun. Thank you for reminding me of that.
 You can keep this. Count them...
 before next time.
 (door opens and closes)
 (chuckles lightly)
 Where on Earth are you going?
 You told me to go to the office,
 so I'm going to the office.
 (door opens and closes)
 Was that Dr. Einstein?
 BOHR: Rumors of an Einstein sighting on campus
 made waves very quickly.
 Had to come see if it was true.
 How are you, Niels?
 In my own little world, marking time.
 It's good to see you're back at work.
 I'm muddling my way through unified field theory again.
 Oh.
 You know, there...
 there is a bit of an anomaly i-in your work.
 I beg your pardon?
 That-that, uh, derivative?
 It can't be third order.
 (quietly): Oh, yes, yes, yes.
 Yeah. Hmm.
 (mumbling)
 What anomaly?
 My God, you're right.
 (chuckles)
 I'd have gone on fumbling my way through that
 for another week if you hadn't pointed it out.
 Yes.
 Ah.
 How about a stroll?
 Ah. (chuckles)
 I read the manifesto you
 and Bertrand Russell wrote.
 It was very impressive.
 And yet no one listens.
 I fear my influence on the use of atomic weapons is long past.
 If only I could turn back the clock to when people
 actually cared about what I had to say.
 Well, time travel.
 Perhaps that could be your final triumph, Albert.
 There are many moments I'd like to relive
 and many ills I'd like to fix.
 Time is a tricky thing.
 You taught me that.
 People have missed you here, Albert.
 Purely selfish on their part, to be sure,
 but they need you
 to keep their minds sharp.
 Well, I need you.
 Not just to keep my mind sharp, but...
 ...for this.
 What are you looking for?
 Uh, an equation.
 Well, half-formed.
 It's more of a scribble.
 Maybe ten, 15 years old.
 If you can give me
 anything else to go on?
 It must be here.
 It's very important.
 Niels and I have been talking abou...
 ♪ ♪
 You kept these?
 I keep...
 everything, Professor.
 (door opens)
 HELEN: You have a visitor.
 EINSTEIN: Oh.
 Hello, Alice.
 Thank you, Helen.
 So I looked up that "Finobacci" thing
 in the Encyclopedia Britannica.
 Here's what I don't get.
 The flowers, how do they know the math?
 I mean, does a flower realize
 it's supposed to have a certain number of petals?
 And why the heck does it care, anyway?
 That's a very interesting question, Alice.
 Hmm. Let me show you something.
 I think I might find an answer for that.
 I'm sure it's in this book somewhere.
 What's this thing?
 That was a gift...
 ...from my grandchildren.
 It's strange.
 If you hadn't noticed it, I...
 might have forgotten it existed.
 That's probably because you're getting old.
 Hmm.
 Finished already?
 He said he's not feeling well.
 Asked me to come back tomorrow.
 So, see you later, I guess.
 Are you all right?
 I'm fine.
 It's time.
 For what?
 Call him.
 That door is closed.
 Are you really such a fool?
 I'm a realist.
 I know when there's nothing more to be done.
 I see.
 And yet you never gave up on nuclear proliferation.
 You did not find it
 too daunting to speak at a Negro college
 when no one else would dare,
 or to defend convicted spies.
 You have compassion
 for so many people.
 You fight
 for so many people.
 Why is it you cannot fight
 to be reconciled with your own son?
 I think I liked you better
 when you kept your thoughts to yourself.
 I am certain you did.
 Hans told me that he wants nothing more
 to do with me.
 You care so much about your legacy,
 about how you will be remembered
 by the world,
 but the world begins and ends
 in your own family.
 Hello, Hansie.
 Hi, Grandpa.
 Hello, Evelyn.
 Come in. Come in.
 Hi, Grandpa.
 Bernard.
 Come in, my boy.
 HANS: You're helping a ten-year-old girl...
 with long division?
 She's very bright.
 You're good with other people,
 with your colleagues,
 the cleaning woman, taxi drivers.
 But you made me...
 feel inferior.
 EINSTEIN: When I was young,
 my father told me that physics was a waste of time.
 I only realized
 at the end of his life
 that he wasn't being cruel.
 He was terrified for me.
 And I forgave him for it...
 ...only too late.
 I'm proud of you, Hans.
 I hope you know that.
 You're a brilliant engineer.
 EVELYN: Bernard, it's your turn, go.
 And a far better father than I ever was.
 What about Eduard?
 I love Eduard as I love you.
 I wish I could've spent more time
 with both of you.
 And Mother?
 You made her feel inconsequential, Papa.
 You told me she wasted her life.
 Your mother was the blood in my veins,
 but I was the thorn in her side.
 She was a great scientist, Hans,
 insatiably curious.
 I would never have achieved anything without her.
 She was the love of my life.
 BERNARD: Stop, you're cheating!
 It's not cheating. I'm winning.
 (laughing): Stop!

 EINSTEIN: Oh, did they make their flight?
 Yes.
 Hans said he hopes to be back in a few weeks.
 I don't have a few weeks.
 Look deep into nature.
 Then you will understand everything better.
 Helen.
 You are a blessing.

 HANS: His brain-- you want to, what,
 slice it up and gaze at it under a microscope?
 What's the alternative?
 Cast it into a furnace?
 Before us
 is your father's last great gift to the world.
 Do what you will with the brain.
 But if you think you can
 comprehend who my father was
 or why he was so brilliant by...
 looking at his brain under a microscope,
 you are sorely mistaken.
 It is just a thing.
 That...
 that is not the man.
 YOUNG EINSTEIN: What is time?
 And, for that matter...
 what is space?
 EINSTEIN: The goal of scientific pursuit should not merely be
 to make use of the world around us.
 It should be to understand it, fundamentally.
 No matter what use it might be.
 YOUNG EINSTEIN: From the smallest molecule
 to the largest galaxy,
 every question must have a definable answer,
 and, well,
 I intend to find those answers.
 What is it, Papa?
 It's a compass, Albert.
 With it, you will never be lost.
 But why does the needle move?
 Something called "magnetism."
 Magnetism? What is that?
 There is a field all around us.
 Invisible, but very powerful.
 A field? What's that?
 And how can it be so powerful if it's invisible?
 And how does a magnet
 know how to talk to the field?
 ALICE: So, how'd you get so smart, anyway?
 I have no special talent,
 but I am very, very curious, Alice.
 All I do is ask questions, just like you do.
 That's the most important thing.
 Anybody can do that.
 ALICE: You know, I was looking up at the moon last night
 and wondering, why doesn't it come crashing down?
 And is it true that it causes the tides?
 And if that's true, then how come my cat's milk
 doesn't slop out of the saucer and spill all over the floor
 when the moon's flying over?
 And where did the moon come from, anyway?
 I mean, I know it's not made of cheese or anything,
 but it had to come from somewhere.
 It has to be made of something, right?
 The stars and all the planets, too,
 how did they get there?
 (fading): How many of them are there, anyway?
