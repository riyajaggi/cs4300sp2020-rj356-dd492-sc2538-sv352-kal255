 Previously on Genius...
 STUDENT:
Walther Rathenau is dead.
 What sort of animals
would do this?
 He was coming to dinner
on Sunday.
 ERNST: It's only because
my customers requested it.
 Everyone has a choice, Ernst.
 I want to leave, Albert, please.
 We're not going anywhere, Elsa.
 There's already
much discussion
 of a Nobel.
 Relativity is a hoax.
 It isn't grounded in any
concrete discovery.
 You want to pay me
for a divorce?
 MAGISTRATE KONIG:
Mileva Maric
 is to retain full custody
in Zurich.
 MILEVA: You idolized
your father, Eduard,
 but he was never there
and I could see
 how painful that was for you.
 Tell Papa I want to see him.
 WEYLAND:
Albert Einstein has engaged
 in a profit-grubbing promotion
 as our country suffers
deprivation and indignity.
 Einstein obviously desires
a public battle.
 It's time I enlisted
some public allies.
 (shouting)
Stay down!
 Elsa, you're right; it's time.
 (phone rings)
 Hello.... It's the United
States embassy.
 GEIST: I am conducting this
inquiry at the request
 of Mr. J. Edgar Hoover.
Hoover.
 What does he want with me?
 ♪ ♪
 (clock ticking)
 (bell dings quietly)
 WOMAN (whispering):
Osip...
 Osip, go wash before
your brothers wake.
 MAN:
Go. Go, go, go, go, go.
 (footsteps quickly approaching)
 Get the kid.
(woman screams)
 Everybody up! Against the wall!
 OSIP (crying): Mama.
WOMAN: What, what is this?
 What have we done?
Shut your mouth, kike.
 OSIP:
Mama!
 Stop resisting!
 WOMAN:
Please, please.
 He didn't do anything.
 (crying):
Please, please.
 PALMER: Almost 3000 subversives
taken into custody,
 from 33 cities
in 23 different states.
 Well done, Mr. Hoover.
 The majority were
known anarchists, sir,
 but we arrested a number
of socialists as well.
 We sent a strong message to
these immigrants that threats
 to the American way of life
will not be tolerated.
 Interrogations
are in progress.
 Deportations will begin
imminently.
 And these reports of abuse?
 The only publications
giving them any ink
 are communist rags. Heh.
 You got a bright future
ahead of you, Edgar.
 Thank you, sir.
 GEIST:
I'm conducting this inquiry
 at the request
of Mr. J. Edgar Hoover,
 director of the United States
Bureau of Investigation.
 Hoover?
- Yes.
 Mr. J. Edgar Hoover.
 What does he want with me?
 He's been quite interested
in your political activities
 and affiliations since your
first visit to New York.
 So if you do not
answer my questions
 to his satisfaction,
 you will not be granted entry
to the United States of America.
 I don't have to
put up with this.
 ELSA:
Albert, sit down.
 No. I will not.
 The land of the free,
 isn't that what you call it?
 I've devoted my life
to freedom of thought,
 to peace for all peoples.
 And your American director
of espionage
 is concerned about
my affiliations?
 I meant no offense.
I'm not here to accuse you
 of anything, sir,
I'm merely here
 to ask questions.
- Really?
 Or are you desperate for the
next rung on the ladder?
 Albert, please.
Flattered to be asked
 to interrogate the famous
Dr. Albert Einstein
 with visions of promotion
in your head?
 Albert!
 Please excuse my husband's
outburst, Mr. Geist.
 Uh, let's return to the subject
 of your former wife,
Mileva Maric.
 When did you last speak?
 Thursday, I think.
 And what did you discuss?
 We discussed our son,
Eduard.
 He's not been well.
 I'm sorry to hear that.
 Are you acquainted
 with Miss Maric's brother?
 (scoffs)
I met him 20 years ago.
 I've not seen him since.
 Are you aware
he now resides
 in the Soviet Union?
 (chuckles)
She might have mentioned it.
 And to your knowledge,
has she ever visited him there?
 She has not... to my knowledge.
 Let's move on, shall we?
 How did you come to know
Chaim Weizmann?
 Oh, I see.
 This is a one-way street
 we are driving down, is it?
 The Weizmanns are
old friends of ours.
 Excuse me, Mrs. Einstein.
 The question was for
your husband.
 How did you come to know
Chaim Weizmann?
 EINSTEIN:
It's all right, Chaim,
 you can admit
you don't understand.
 WEIZMANN: Albert, you have been
explaining general relativity
 for more than three hours,
and I am fully convinced
 that you understand it.
(Einstein chuckles)
 (sighs)
I anticipated
 that many would struggle
to comprehend my theory,
 but I must admit, I've
been a little taken aback
 by the jeers and the snubs,
 particularly from
the Nobel committee.
 There will always be resistance
to revolutionary ideas.
 But we've proved it with
mathematics, with astronomy.
 WEIZMANN: Some people see
a beautiful proof,
 others a damning repudiation.
 That's why certain scientists
loathe you,
 while the rest of the world
has fallen hopelessly in love.
 It's unpleasant sensation
to be beloved,
 not for your ideas,
 but for the image
people have of you.
 Of course, your fame also
affords us an opportunity.
 Chaim, if this is an attempt
to recruit me
 to the Zionist cause,
you should save your breath.
 Albert...
- No.
 We have just barely
made it through
 the death and
destruction of the war.
 You cannot ask me to support
the creation of a new nation
 that will inevitably bring us
to war again.
 The world's Jews are in
desperate need of a refuge.
 But is Palestine the answer?
 It is not uninhabited land.
 You should visit
with me someday.
 You'll find our Arab friends
living in harmony
 with our Jewish brothers
and sisters.
 The Arab people will
rise up to resist
 such in influx of newcomers.
 It's not a matter
of "if", but "when."
 Will you join me upstairs?
 There's something
I'd like to show you.
 WEIZMANN:
Kill the Jews.
 That was their battle cry...
1903.
 The day after the
Russian Orthodox Easter.
 They celebrated
resurrection
 then brutally murdered
hundreds of our people.
 This was but one
of many pogroms.
 Ukraine, Poland,
 even Argentina.
 Babies ripped
from mothers' arms.
 Slaughtered.
 My God.
 So, of course, they fled.
 As our ancestors did from Egypt.
 To Berlin, to London,
to Chicago,
 Minneapolis, New York.
 And what did they find
when they arrived?
 Squalor, pestilence.
 Blamed for the ills
of the nations
 in which they sought refuge.
 Last year, the attorney general
of the United States
 ordered raids that rounded up
thousands of Jews,
 accusing them of
anarchism and radicalism.
 An excuse to deport them.
 When I tell you that
 our people are desperate for
a home, it is not harsh words
 from jealous colleagues
they are fleeing.
 Nor a snub from
the Nobel committee.
 It is endless
death and destruction.
 There are dozens of nations
hospitable to Arabs.
 But our tribesmen?
 They have nowhere to go.
 I sail for the United
States next week
 to raise money for a Hebrew
university in Palestine.
 Come with me.
 ELSA: I should never have let
you go to dinner with Chaim.
 I knew this would happen.
 You are providing ammunition
to those fools who believe
 that Jews
cannot be good Germans.
 I've never aspired to be
a good German.
 Well, this does not
concern only you.
 No, it doesn't.
 It concerns legions of our
people who are suffering.
 And you're going to rescue them
all with Chaim's university,
 are you? Elsa, I know you
are not this cold-hearted.
 And what about Brussels,
the Solvay Conference?
 You're the only German
scientist invited,
 and you're simply going to cancel?
Four years of carnage.
 Now I should be the one
who is supposed to heal
 all the wounds
of the war?
 And Eduard,
 you're going to miss
his piano recital.
 I'll take him sailing
this summer.
 He'll understand.
 To you, this is
a chance to do good.
 To the rest of the world,
it is-- it's a famous man
 putting his race
above his country.
 And your enemies
will use it against you.
 How the world sees me,
it's not important to me.
 I wonder if you'll
feel the same way
 should the world
turn against you.
 ("The Stars and Stripes Forever"
begins)
 (reporters clamoring)
 REPORTER 2: Dr. Einstein, how
long will you stay...
 (clamoring continues)
 REPORTER 3: Sir!
REPORTER 4: Professor!
 He can't answer
if he can't hear!
 Uh, you, sir.
 Professor Einstein, can you
explain the theory of relativity
 in one sentence?
 All of my life I've tried
to put it into one book
 and this fellow wants it
in a single sentence.
 (laughter)
 (reporters clamoring)
 You, there. Will you
be giving any lectures
 while you're here?
EINSTEIN: Yes.
 We have many scheduled,
but I am here primarily
 to support a Jewish university...
Dr. Einstein
 will lecture
at Princeton,
 and then visit Harvard.
 REPORTER 5: Do you believe
Zionism does more
 harm than good?
 No. That is foolish thinking.
 Well, then what do you say
to those who believe
 Jews should assimilate
into American society?
 I say it is a Jewish weakness,
 trying always to keep
the gentiles in good humor.
 (laughter) Dr. Einstein
is here to raise funds
 for a university.
 Education is a
boon to all.
 Thank you very much.
 (upbeat march playing,
overlapping chatter)
 EINSTEIN:
I don't appreciate
 anyone doing my
talking for me!
 Tell her, Chaim. You brought me
here to speak out,
 not to trot in front of the
press like some circus animal.
 Chaim brought you here
to advance the cause.
 Insulting American Jews
is not an effective approach.
 Elsa's right.
 As I told you, most of
them are assimilationists,
 especially the
wealthy ones.
 So we shouldn't attempt
to change their minds?
 By calling them weak?
I was asked the question!
 And I told you how to answer it.
 "Education is
a boon to all"
 is not an answer.
 You and I are in
agreement, Albert.
 We should not have to give
up any part of ourselves
 in order to be
treated as equals.
 But we need their money.
 I took the liberty of
writing some remarks
 for you for tomorrow.
 SVANTE:
Tell me, Dr. Lenard,
 why should we deny Einstein
the Nobel this year?
 My case remains the same.
 Theoretical physics is
the purview of con artists.
 They are like... Cubist
painters... (laughs)
 ...unable to render
form decently,
 convincing the world
their scrawlings are high art.
 I quite like
the little Spanish chap.
 (laughs)
 There is no science
 but that which can be
explored experimentally.
 Albert Einstein, unpalatable to
you though he may be, Philipp,
 is the most famous scientist
in the world.
 To deny him
the Nobel again-- well,
 some might say we are beginning
to look like fools.
 (scoffs)
 (crowd cheering)
 Thank you very much.
 EINSTEIN: Thank you.
Thank you so much.
 WOMAN:
God bless you, Einstein.
 Thank you very much.
 BOY:
Dr. Einstein!
 EINSTEIN:
Thank you.
 Dr. Einstein! Dr. Einstein!
 Hey, kid! Where do you think
you're going?
 Dr. Einstein!
 Where the hell do you think
you're going, huh?
 Dr. Einstein!
You bastard!
 Please, sir,
let him go.
 Are you all right, young man?
 To build a home
for the Jews.
 I cannot take it.
 They took my father away.
They said he was dangerous.
 Please.
 I want him to have home.
 What is your name?
 Osip.
 Thank you, Osip.
 I promise
I'll make good use of it.
 (applause)
 EINSTEIN:
Thank you for coming.
 As a young Jewish man
 with dreams of discovering the
mysteries of the universe...
 ...I was lucky
 to have many
inspiring professors.
 Well, the truth is,
 most of my professors thought
I would not grow up
 to accomplish much of anything.
 (audience laughs)
 I have not been
the best of Jews.
 Before today, I had not set foot
in a synagogue in years.
 But now, I've come to believe
 a university
that celebrates our heritage
 is essential to the future
of our youth.
 Today, I am here with you to
celebrate our Jewish heritage
 as special and of value.
 Unique.
 (audience murmurs)
 Some people think
it is dangerous,
 defining ourselves as different.
 Blend in, they say.
Do not stand out.
 Do not ask questions
of authority.
 To me, they sound suspiciously
like my stuffy old professors.
 (audience laughs)
 We deserve to be accepted.
 Our heritage,
our faith,
 our traditions
and history.
 Why must we assimilate?
 There is no justice
in that.
 Only loss.
 Our people
 have sacrificed enough.
 (coins dropping)
 (applause fades)
 GEIST:
So the trip wasn't a success?
 People were not as generous
as we had hoped.
 EINSTEIN:
That's not true, Elsa.
 There was that little boy, Osip,
who gave me a nickel.
 And the poor woman
in the Bronx
 who dropped her wedding ring
in the donation box.
 Who knows?
 Maybe one day, we'll
bump into her again
 and we can buy her a new one.
 ELSA: My husband's
optimism is one of his
 most admirable
qualities.
 Right, then.
 Um...
 were you aware of
any persons at these rallies
 who held subversive beliefs?
 EINSTEIN:
Well, I was there.
 ELSA: Oh, Albert.
And what subversive beliefs
 do you hold,
Dr. Einstein?
 Well, they're mostly
established facts now.
 Things like the existence
of molecules,
 the notion that
gravity bends light,
 tiny...
- Sir,
 I was referring to
your political beliefs,
 not your scientific ideas.
 But I think
you knew that.
 You do?
 Because you chose two words
 which can mean many things.
 Communists, socialists,
anarchists.
 Were you aware of
their presence at...
 I didn't take a survey
at the door.
 If you're going to
accuse me of something,
 Mr. Geist, please,
let's get to the point.
 Very well.
 Dr. Einstein, the United
States government
 has reason to believe
that you are
 a member of the Communist Party.
 Oh.
 GEIST: "Albert Einstein
advises, advocates,
 "or teaches
individual resistance
 "to all accepted
authorities--
 "whether it be a question
of peace or war,
 "government or religion,
 mathematics or anthrology..."
 She must have meant
anthropology.
 ELSA:
May I see that,
 please?
 The Women's Patriot Corporation.
 You mean to tell me
that we are being interrogated
 because a gaggle
of honking geese wrote a letter?
 The Women's Patriot
Corporation...
 EINSTEIN:
Frothingham?
 Frothingham, that can't
possibly be a person's name.
 Mrs. Frothingham
and her compatriots
 are concerned American citizens.
 Director Hoover
feels their findings
 are worthy
of being taken seriously.
 Well, these geese are
right about one thing:
 I do have a contempt
for authority.
 Oh, it's true.
 The surest way to get my husband
to do what you want is to
 tell him not to.
Dr. Einstein...
 EINSTEIN:
Mrs. Frothingham
 suggests here that relativity is
of no more practical importance
 than the number
of angels
 dancing on the head of a pin.
 How many angels do you,
 or Mrs. Frothingham,
 imagine could fit
 on the head of a pin...
(laughs)
 ...and still have room to dance?
 I suggest you treat me
 and these proceedings
with some respect.
 You're not making it
 easy for me.
 Well, let's get back to
the matter at hand, shall we?
 Are you in fact a member
of the Communist Party?
 (laughs)
 Well, Mr. Geist,
 despite my deepest sympathy for
certain socialist ideals...
 Such as?
 EINSTEIN:
Economic fairness,
 the belief that it is
our duty as humans
 to contribute to
our communities.
 But the notion that I should
join the Communist Party--
 a commitment that would require
I surrender my autonomy
 to the authority
of the state--
 that, good sir,
is a nonsense.
 A monkey in a hat riding
a dog to a donut factory.
 (Elsa laughs)
 Well, I'm concerned
that neither of you are...
 appreciating the gravity
of this situation.
 I dare say I know
a bit more about gravity
 than you, Mr. Geist,
 and a few
other things besides.
 How long have you
lived in Berlin?
 A little over two years.
 What do you think
about Mr. Hitler?
 Oh, he's unpleasant.
 But in the grand scheme
of things,
 he seems little more
than a nuisance.
 EINSTEIN: I don't
understand you, Mr. Geist.
 Hitler rejects
economic rule
 and talks of expanding
German territory.
 He advocates for eugenics.
 Who are the impure ones
he speaks of, do you think?
 I would like to leave Germany
of my own accord
 and save him the trouble
of violently exiling me.
 Or worse.
 Do you really think the German
people would stand for that?
 The government deporting the
world's most famous scientist?
 Jewish scientist.
I'm a Jew.
 Zionism, communism...
 these are not the threats
 that should be concerning
you, Mr. Geist.
 It's fascism that should
have you trembling.
 Dr. Einstein,
we're getting off...
 EINSTEIN:
Tell me,
 have you heard
of Walther Rathenau?
 RATHENAU: You know,
it's five years
 since I've looked
at this.
 (sighs):
And I...
 I hardly remember writing it.
 "That which produces harmony
in the chorus of the universe
 can seem a discord to
our partial hearing."
 These words,
they're beautiful.
 Thank you.
 So, how can you write about
freedom for the human spirit,
 and yet still be
opposed to Zionism?
 (sighs) If I wanted
to hear someone call me
 a traitor to the Jews,
 I would have invited
your friend, Weizmann.
 EINSTEIN: I still
don't understand why
 you won't speak
out for us.
 Even if I agreed
with your cause,
 Albert,
 do you really think
 that my speaking out
would make it any better?
 EINSTEIN: You are
the most powerful Jew
 in Germany; your voice
would make a difference.
 The Gentiles respect you.
 Yeah, and how long
 do you think
that respect will last
 if I put my religion
above my nation?
 Oh... - Already, the radicals
 are blaming me
 for Germany's paying
war reparations.
 I am foreign minister
 in a difficult time.
 Thank you for this.
 Are you still coming
for dinner on Sunday?
 If Elsa is making
the roast.
 She will.
 You'll never be
one of them.
 EINSTEIN:
Walther was a German patriot.
 Still, they slaughtered him
like an animal.
 Minister Rathenau was
assassinated a decade ago.
 Yes, it has been ten years.
 And since then, your
stock market has crashed,
 people are out of work,
 starving.
 Hitler promises jobs, bread,
pride to desperate people.
 Why is it so hard to believe
they might follow him?
 Mrs. Einstein, would
you please excuse us?
 No, I think not.
 My wife and I
have no secrets.
 Well, I'm afraid I cannot
continue the interview
 with Mrs. Einstein in the room.
 Why don't you go home
 and finish the packing.
 (door closes)
 Please...
 tell me about Betty Neumann.
 She worked for me.
She no longer does.
 Mm.
 I have a very efficient woman
handling my affairs now.
 Miss Dukas.
 Perhaps not as attractive
 as Miss Neumann,
 but I need a good secretary...
Secretary?
 Was that the full extent of your
relationship with Miss Neumann?
 You mean was I
intimate with her?
 Sexually?
 I was. But what does that
got to do with anything?
 Men who have been indiscrete
are vulnerable to blackmail.
 A communist operative
could pressure you...
 No one is going to
pressure me about Betty.
 You better start walking.
 Are you throwing me out?
 The opera?
 You've been looking
forward to it all week.
 You'll miss the curtain.
 I'm only going
if I can wear a disguise.
 Don't be ridiculous.
- I have to.
 Because I'm either
Dr. Albert Einstein,
 or I'm that dirty Jew
who broke physics.
 I've been those things
for so long,
 I'm beginning to forget
who I started out to be.
 Have you seen this?
 Lenard's latest,
condemning general relativity
 as wild speculation,
 propped up
by the Jewish press,
 signed by 19 physicists.
 Good ones?
 No.
- Well, then...
 My dear, I thought you
 would have gone on to
the opera without me.
 Sit.
 I'm sorry. I was delayed.
 I should have called.
 Or asked Betty to do so.
 Maybe she was
otherwise engaged.
 Between your thighs perhaps?
 This is nothing, with Betty.
A momentary escape.
 Some pleasure to numb
 the world's constant
pull upon me.
 It has nothing to do
with our life.
 You are a selfish man.
 You have convinced yourself that
your contributions to the world
 absolve you from
the responsibility you bear
 to those you claim to love.
 They do not.
 I've never said that.
 Your actions speak for you.
You don't listen.
 I do.
 I don't feel safe, Albert.
 And I have told you this
over and over again.
 And still, you fan the flames
with Chaim,
 insisting that we stay here.
 For what, pride?
 The cause is important,
so is my work here.
 Your sons haven't
seen you in months.
 Yes, well, things have been...
 Things are always.
 I love this life,
 but I will not be treated
as an afterthought in it.
 So I will make
a bargain with you.
 You may engage in as many
dalliances as you like,
 but when you have made
a commitment to me,
 I come first.
 And to prove it to me,
you will take me away from here,
 at least for a month
or two, and soon.
 This is not negotiable.
 Elsa.
 You made me.
 I was a lump of clay,
 and you shaped me.
 I'm not sure I'd still be alive
if you hadn't taken me in.
 I should never have treated
you with such disregard.
 From the bottom
of my heart,
 I'm sorry.
 EINSTEIN:
Elsa knows everything,
 so there's no threat
of blackmail, Mr. Geist.
 I see.
- There's so much about the world
 Elsa has always understood
more keenly than I.
 The shifts and moods
of the culture,
 she sees such things
the way I see calculations.
 If it were me and me alone
I had to worry about,
 I probably would have lived
a more reckless life.
 I owe Elsa
a great deal,
 so I did as she asked.
 I gave my attention to science,
lectures, conferences.
 I accepted the offer to go to Japan.
(jazz music playing)
 We sailed far from Germany.
 I cannot deny the skill
involved, (knock on door)
 but it's a little
too erratic for me,
 this modern music.
 Thank you.
 ♪ ♪
 Thank you.
 ELSA:
Albert.
 They've done it.
 They've given you
the Nobel Prize!
 So they've finally run out
of excuses?
 If we disembark
at the next port,
 we can make it to Sweden
in time for the ceremony.
 Ah.
 Let them present the medal
to an empty chair.
 I know you detest
the committee, but...
 They refuse to acknowledge
relativity.
 What?
- But they cannot ignore me,
 so I'm being
given the prize
 for my paper on the
photoelectric effect.
 Really?
My dearest Elsa,
 I know care not one
whit about physics,
 but let me remind you,
 this paper
would not have existed
 without the work
of Philipp Lenard.
 (gasps): Oh, my. - (laughs)
 He's going to lose his mind.
 Welcome to the Nazi Party,
Dr. Lenard.
 We are honored to
have you in our ranks.
 The honor is entirely mine.
 EINSTEIN:
I'd hoped when we returned home
 that the mood
would have cooled,
 and I could have continued
my work with Chaim,
 but Elsa wouldn't have it.
 So the great Albert Einstein
bends to authority after all?
 (chuckles)
 Who knew you had a sense
of humor, Mr. Geist?
 If my wife had her way, we would
never have returned to Germany.
 And sitting here today,
I rather wish we hadn't.
 Why did you?
 I like my study,
with all my things just so.
 My tobacco shop, where Ernst
always has my favorite blend.
 I was settled.
 I'm not quite sure
how all of that happened.
 A settled man is never
what I set out to be.
 So...
 your contention is
that you gave up
 your political activities
entirely,
 and devoted yourself
only to your science?
 Mm.
 (bell jingles)
Ernst, my good man.
 Ah, two tins of the usual,
Professor?
 Indeed. And I would like
you to meet my good friend
 and thorn in my scientific
side, Dr. Niels Bohr.
 (clears throat)
Hello.
 An honor to
meet you, sir.
 Ernst, are you familiar with
 Heisenberg's
uncertainty principle?
 (chuckles)
- I can't say
 that I am, Professor.
 Well, it states that
the more accurately we measure
 the velocity of a particle,
 the less accurately we can
measure its position in space.
 So you know exactly how fast
a thing is going...
 Yes, but if we do, we cannot
also know where that thing is.
 Does that sound logical to you?
 No, sir.
Of course not.
 And according to my
esteemed colleague,
 the particle does not exist
at all until we observe it.
 That makes absolutely
no sense to me.
 Exactly!
- (mouths)
 Thank you, Ernst.
 Shall we stop by
your butcher's as well?
 Perhaps he has an opinion
on the matter.
 Ha, ha, ha, very amusing.
 Albert, the uncertainty
principle works, it functions.
 And it allows us to make use
of the quantum world.
 The goal of scientific
pursuit should not be merely
 to make use of
the world around us,
 it should be to understand
it, fundamentally.
 No matter what
use it might be.
 Albert, Albert, watch out!
(horn honks)
 Just watch where
you're going, please.
 Why should I?
Why should either of us?
 According to you, if that
automobile was a particle,
 but we didn't see it,
 it wouldn't have
been there at all.
 (horn honks)
 We would be perfectly safe.
 Automobiles aren't
subatomic particles, Albert.
 EINSTEIN:
Niels, it defies common sense
 that the rules which govern
those things we can see
 do not apply
to those we cannot.
 I will not turn off
my brain simply because
 you've decided the
matter is settled.
 Well, if you don't start using
your brain to observe what's
 right in front of you, you're
going to get yourself killed.
 Hmm.
 Did you read his speech?
From Nuremburg?
 Yeah, he's an
egomaniacal swindler.
 No one takes
him seriously.
 EINSTEIN: I'm beginning to
wonder if perhaps we should.
 Well, I didn't come here
to discuss politics.
 Of course not. Oh...
 I've been thinking.
 What if we imagined
a box full of light,
 and we placed a precise
number of protons
 inside the box.
 We weigh a single one of them,
and let it out.
 What happens?
 GEIST:
Sorry. One more time.
 These particles,
smaller than we can see,
 even with a microscope,
 are measurable only as...
probabilities,
 where they might exist in space?
 How fast they might be going?
 Very good.
 So it's a game
of chance, then?
 A mathematical guess?
 According to Bohr.
 But I do not believe God
plays dice with the universe.
 You know, in all this talk
of your being a Jew,
 this is the first time
you've mentioned God.
 That's another one of
those words
 that can mean
many different things.
 But you do believe in God?
If I say no,
 will it prove I'm a communist?
 (chuckles softly)
 What I believe...
 is the universe
is so extraordinary,
 only God could have created it.
 My job is simply to figure out
how He did it.
 (chuckles)
 What about you, Mr. Geist?
 Are you a religious man?
 I was raised Methodist.
 Are you still?
 Well... Mother was
the true believer.
 (chuckles)
 Every holiday, she
would make extra food,
 and she'd pile me and my
brother into the Studebaker
 with all the dishes,
 and we'd drive across town
to the train station.
 That's where all the men
who were out of work went
 to get warm.
 And we would
serve them all plates.
 I used to think we must be
the richest family in town
 to be able to give up so much
when no one else did.
 Your mother sounds
like a wonderful woman.
 She was.
 I thought about her when
you spoke about the wedding ring
 dropped in your donation box.
 That sounded like
something she would do.
 How did you end up here?
 I wanted to be of service.
 You are your mother's son.
 She would've preferred
I become a minister.
 I suspect she was proud
of you nonetheless.

 ELEANOR: Call for you,
Mr. Geist.
 Take a message
please, Eleanor.
 It's Director Hoover.

 You have nothing

 It pains me to say it,

 Switzerland is safe.
 What about Margot and Ilse?
 They're determined to

 Perhaps they will
change their minds

 Hello, Teddy.
 I'm sorry I didn't come sooner.
 I will do all that I can

 Then when you are
feeling better...
 you can come to America

 I should have been better

 I am much better at

 I do hope you know, though...

 Remember?
 I'd like to play for you now.

 LENARD: A healthy German spirit
must deflect from itself
 the foreign spirit of Judaism,
 which arises as a dark power
everywhere.
 And which is so
clearly designated
 in everything that belongs
to Einstein's theory.
 German scientists have a duty
to bring enlightenment,
 to break the power of the dark
spirit everywhere possible.
 SECRETARY: Dr. Lenard,
it's an honor.
 He's expecting
you, sir.
 Heil, Mein Fuhrer.
 Dr. Einstein.
 I relayed your answers
to Mr. Hoover
 with the recommendation
that we approve your visa.
 And?
 I've been ordered to deny it.
 (sniffs)
 Sir, I want you to
know that I believe
 I called you here
in good faith.
 And I believed
that I...
 that I was...
 Empowered?
 To be of service?
 Yes.
 You're a good man, Mr. Geist.
 I apologize for
suggesting otherwise.
 I wish you the
best of luck.

 Well, do you
have the visas?
 You'll have to call
your reporter friend.
 You're going to want

 HOOVER:
Get me Geist!
 Someone called
The New York Times.
 Hmm.
 The State Department
switchboard's
 been overloaded by citizens
incensed that their government
 is harassing the great
Albert Einstein.
 Hmm.
 Thank you.
 Congress has begun
to receive calls.
 Quite a few important men
have egg on their faces.
 Your Mr. Edgar
left me little choice.
 I understand. Hmm.
 How far we've come.
 However...
 I have been instructed
to issue your visa
 only if you sign this.
 It's a declaration that
you are not a member
 of the Communist Party.
 EINSTEIN:
Yes, I can see that.
 For your safety and
the safety of your family.
 It's only a
piece of paper.
 Please.
 Please accept
this compromise.

 Your nation, Mr. Geist,
it's a miracle.
 The beautiful myth of it.
 Scrappy revolutionaries
rejecting monarchy
 for self-government
built from shared values,
 common purpose.
 I can understand why a man
might want to serve a nation
 that tells itself
a story like that.
 And I also understand
 how painful it can be
when the myth
 does not quite fit
with the reality.
 I cannot sign this.

 No.
