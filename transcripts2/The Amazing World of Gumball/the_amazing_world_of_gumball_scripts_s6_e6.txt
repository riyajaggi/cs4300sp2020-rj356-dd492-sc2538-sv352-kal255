 Together: Grandpa Frankie! Oh, hey, kids. Uh...Nicole, these are for you. Oh. Thank you. "You'll always be alive in our hearts... Great-Aunt Petunia." Sorry. I couldn't find one that said "Nicole." Especially not in the dark. Who invited him? Me! It's a proper family get-together. You're late, Dad. You almost missed the song. Well, at least I'm here now. [ Whispering ] And if anyone asks, I was also here Thursday night between 8:00 and 11:00.

Yeah, I know. I get the hint. Don't worry, Dad. The Vermin Man isn't about you. It's a tradition as old as time. Mom said it started when the Pilgrims first came to this land and they were all abandoned by their deadbeat father. You know -- the British. Mm, no, son. I think it was probably invented by your mom. 'Cause she can't stand me. -I invented it to distract our son from remembering the date you walked out on us... and, yes, because I can't stand you. I'm sorry, Richard. I shouldn't have come. I can't make up for what I've done to you. I've missed too much. ♪ Has he gone? The lousy bum stole my wallet! ♪ Oh, this is bad. What can we do to cheer him up? Oh, I know! Dad rock. [ Rock music plays ] ♪ I'm gonna rock you till you  feel the rock 'n' roll ♪ ♪ Rock around the rock  that is made out of rock ♪ ♪ I'm gonna rock it back and  forth like a rocking horse ♪ ♪ Gonna quench your thirst  with some rock on the rocks ♪ Wow. There's a lot of promise of rocking, but... Yeah, it's like having someone take you around a theme park telling you how much fun you're gonna have, but you never get to go on the rides. Well, he's kind of rocking. [ Rock music continues ] Just encourage him with a bit of Dad dancing. [ Snap! ] ♪ [ Crying ] What's wrong? That's the music from my dad's generation. ♪ We'll follow you into the -- ♪ [ Heavy metal music plays ] [ Grunge music plays ] [ Dance music plays ] ♪ Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa ♪ ♪ Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh ♪ [ Whimpers ] [ Music stops ] Faker. You only bought the T-shirts for the cool bands, didn't you? Mm-hmm. Come on. Let's go to Joyful Burger. For once, you've got our permission to comfort eat. How about a joke? Knock, knock? Dad?! What? No. [ Wailing ] Larry: So, that's one large fries. I mean, I don't have any real... Beef. ...with my dad. Sure, he's made mis-- Steaks. But now there's too much time to... Ketchup. And all this has left me in a... Bit of a pickle. While he's gone on to make a... Hash brown. ...of his life. It's so hard when a parent... Desserts. ...you. And now I... Doughnut. ...know what to do. Every night... Ice scream. ...inside. I just feel so... Waffle. I ought to tell him how I feel, but I guess I'm too much of a... Boneless chicken! And comfort eating is not going to make me any happier. [ Laughs, chomps ] [ Laughs, chomps ] [ Laughs, chomps ] This doesn't look good to me. I don't think anyone would enjoy the sight of a grown man smearing burger meat into his face in a kid's ball pit. Yep. Even in Japan, that's pretty niche. [ Screaming ] Hmm. Isn't all this eating dangerous? Nah, this is Richard Watterson. He can take it. [ Sirens wailing ] Yeah, I was more worried about the staff. It was like shoveling French fries down an elevator shaft. Well. Now my brain  and my stomach are sad. Darwin: I've got an idea! ♪ This is what I do when I feel blue. I look at the clouds and see that even the darkest ones eventually drift away. And it's fun 'cause they make shapes. Like that one. It looks like a hat. A hat like my father's. -Uh, sure. -How about that one? Anais: It's like a horseshoe. Shoes are for walking. Like he walked out on me. [ Groans ] Well, how about that one? It looks like a...uh... Oh. Looks like a popsicle. Oh. Uh...I-I guess. Popsicles are cold like the Arctic Ocean. And that's cold because it's got lots of icebergs in it. That's why it's dangerous for ships. Because icebergs sink ships. And what's the first thing to leave a sinking ship? A rat. Together: [ Groan ] And rats are covered in fleas. Just like my father "flea'd" from me. Yeah, we got it. You could have stopped at "rat." Gumball: I just. I... I don't know what else to do. Dad, you've just got to talk to Grandpa Frankie about it. [ Groans ] There's no point. He's just a con man. The best I can hope for is that the next time I see him, he doesn't hustle me out of $700 with that ball-and-cups trick...again. These cups and this ball are worth $2,000. But as you're my son, I'll let you have 'em for $700! [ Gasps ] [ Groans ] I don't know what to say to him. I can't put it into words. Would it help to sing it? You know what? I think maybe it would. [ Breathes deeply ] [ Serene piano music plays ] [ Screams ] [ Cackling ] [ Muttering ] [ Crying ] Brrreeeueew! Was that clear? Together: Uh... -Uh-huh. -Uh-huh. But that doesn't mean you can't fix... whatever that was... between you. I would need to make a time machine. Why? Because if I invented a time machine, my dad would be really proud of me. It's too late, anyway. I'll never get those years back. [ Sobbing ] No. Not true. You can't travel back in time and experience the things you guys missed, but you can travel forward in time and fix the things that are yet to come. Because the future starts now. [ Gasp ] Huh. That was really good, wasn't it? [ Chuckles ] Kind of surprised myself there. I was like, "The future starts now." Bam! Nailed it. [ Chuckles ] The future starts now... Now. Now. [ Imitates explosion ] [ Imitates explosion ] [ Imitates explosion ] [ Imitates explosion ] Can we just -- Yeah. Sorry. Let's just get on with it. [ Alarm blaring in distance ] [ Groans ] Oh. There you are. So, here's the plan. You guys go through everything a father and son should have shared, but, like, really fast. Three, two, one. Go! So, uh... where do we start? How about a piggyback ride? Okay. That's as good a place as -- Aah! [ Sentimental music plays ] You ready, champ? Yeah! [ Laughs ] Well done, son! And now we run! Why? Because, technically, that's not our ball. Huh? [ Groans ] [ Grunts ] Ow! Frankie: This priceless heirloom was passed down from grandfather to father, and from father to son. And it was passed down from that son's second-story window by my former cellmate to me. And now it's yours. I...don't know what to say. Good. 'Cause anything you do say might be held against you in court. What? [ Pants, grunts ] [ Sirens blaring ] Officer: Okay, go, go, go, go, go! Now make sure you don't forget the little bit under your chin. [ Grunts ] Very good. Now the second one. [ Straining ] And now the third. [ Whimpering ] Great. Now you just have to slide down the drain pipe and run. [ Dogs barking ] [ Screaming ] [ Sighs ] Now, first, you release the hand brake. Now gently slip it into drive. Aah! Agh, I don't like it, Dad! It's perfectly normal to be nervous your first time driving... a getaway car. I'm sorry. I can't do this! [ Alarms blaring ] Hey, wait! Where are you going?! [ Siren chirps ] Oh. Now reel it in, son. Nice and easy. Ha ha ha ha! [ Horn honking ] Okay, I think that's enough. What? What did I do wrong?! It's no good. I thought this would be a father-and-son bonding thing. You know? We'd talk about life. Oh, that's cool. Let's do that now. [ Sniffles ] That would be nice. Okay, so, "life." Life is like 15, 20 years, but you can be out in 10 with good behavior. Oh, forget it! Oh, look, son. You know what I'm like. I'm the Vermin Man. I'm no role model. I'm more of a parole model. [ Chuckles ] Eugh. Oh. Look, I didn't want you to turn out like me. And I was right. Look at you. You turned out great. And your kids love you. I didn't start off as a good father. But your kids... they see you as better than you are, so every day, you bust your chops and try to live up to that. It's too late for me. No. Not true. You know what my kids taught me today? The future starts now. [ Sniffles ] Yeah. I'm sorry, son. I'm sorry, too. [ Voice breaking ] You've got nothing to apologize for. Yes, I do. I stole your wallet. And don't worry. It's not mine anyway.
