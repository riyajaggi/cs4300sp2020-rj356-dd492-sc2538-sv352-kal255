 I love looking out at the horizon and imagining all the other places there are in the world and all the possibilities. Today's the day. Finally. After the grift, we both get what we want. We split the 17,000 bucks, shake hands part ways. This soils report certifies that there is indeed gold in Avonlea. I have to write to Gilbert. I-I have to let him know about the gold. There's gold in Avonlea?

 I could really use your help with the farm. Ten years on this ship, I've been cold. Things are going to change starting right now. Who have you been listening to recently? Everyone around here or that person in here? Nate and Mr Dunlop are working together. They used us. They're grifters! Over here! That's enough now, Mr Dunlop, or whoever you are. Anne Shirley Cuthbert, what have you done to your hair? I didn't mean to dye it green! What is it that makes people take such delight in the misery of others? You should've heard how everybody laughed after Mr Phillips called me the new boy. Oh, and to make matters worse, Gilbert was there.

 Anne. - You're back. - Yes. I've never actually met a coloured person before. It... it's a rare pleasure to meet you. A pleasure to meet you too, Anne of Green Gables. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. I just feel too different. - You're unique. - Unique means weird. I think it means singular and extraordinary. You have a life of such joy before you. Not without hardship not without bumps in the road. Cole, hurry! I'm not going back. Aunt Jo said I could live with her. I'll miss you. I vow to be a distinguished and worthy husband. Prissy? I'm going to help pave the way for Miss Stacy. I know just how it is to be new and judged harshly. - Good morning, everyone! - Good morning! Let's get to know each other. There's going to be a town hall meeting tomorrow night. We're holding a vote on removing Miss Stacy. If this was a story, what would the hero do? Save Miss Stacy! Miss Stacy is an inspiration. We learned more from her in a week than we learned in a year. Different isn't bad. It's just not the same. Afternoon, ladies. I hope you don't mind me saying so, Miss, but you're very pretty. Name is Sebastian. - You can call me Bash. - Mary. Fortune finally smiled on me. It made me forget all my troubles. I think I learned some things about love too. It doesn't look the same for everyone. It can come in so many forms and how can there be anything wrong with a life if it's spent with the person you love? To love and to cherish... until death you do part? You're not leaving school early. I wanna be with my family. I've decided I'm going to be a teacher just like Miss Stacy. Tragical romance and all? Remains to be seen. Come on, Belle. This pinecone is the progeny of this tree, Belle. Mother and daughter. Family. Every tree here is connected to each other. Wonder what it must feel like to have such certainty in life? What it feels like to truly belong? You'll know that soon enough, won't you? Let's start thinking of baby names for you! Of course. I'm late. Let's go. Jump up. Come on! ♪ First thing, we'd climb a tree ♪ ♪ And maybe then we'd talk ♪ ♪ Or sit silently ♪ ♪ And listen to our thoughts ♪ ♪ With illusions of someday ♪ ♪ Cast in a golden light ♪ ♪ No dress rehearsal ♪ ♪ This is our life ♪ ♪ You are ahead by a century ♪ - ♪ This is our life ♪ - ♪ You are ahead by a century ♪ Come on. Over here, over here! Faster! Go, Billy! I can't move. Nice shot! I'm open. I'm open! - I got it! - Go, Gilbert! - Come on! - Nice. Take it, go! - Yes! - Stop! Keep going! Well done, Gilbert! - Pass it to Moody! - The boys are so good. Moody. Come on! Come on. It's so cold... Right here. Right here. - Hello! - Hi, Anne. Hi, Anne. Charlie, come on, save that! Look at the score! Ruby, you're supposed to be covering the game. - Gilbert, come on. Pass! - Where are the highlights? Do you even know the score? It's just a school newspaper, Anne, not The Daily Telegraph. We don't even need an article about the game. We're all here. She's busy ogling you know who! Oh! Oh... Cad! Bounder! Josie, you've really caught Billy's eye. Oh, I'm trying to make my peace with it. - With what? - That Josie may become her sister. In-law. Sister-in-law. Alright. I'll write the article. - Who are the team captains this week? - Gilbert. - And? - Whoever. - Nice shot. - Thanks. Diana. Moody! Don't fall! Going to take pity on poor Moody? You know my family won't allow it. Too rich to be a minister's wife. Wait here. Wait here! Isn't... Ruby covering the game? Ruby's very preoccupied. With a certain someone. - Pass. - Double-back! He noticed me. - He looked right at me and smiled. - You're delusional. Ruby Blythe. Gilbert! Gilbert! - Over here! - I'll take it. Get it! Come on! Here! Do not stray, sweetheart. This is not a safe place. This stupid stick's too short for me this year. Be a man. Take the blame. The stick isn't lousy, you are. Oh, they're here! Now we'll see just how badly you're gonna swallow your words, Billy boy. Uh, "thank you". Hello. Good afternoon. I'd like to order a stick, if I may. Uh, I brought money. Yes. We make for you. We bring when ready. So, when might I expect it? When ready. Pass to Billy! He's open! Hello there. I'd love to write an article about you and... and how you make your splendid sticks. Would that be possible? What is "article"? I would ask you questions, learn about you, your work and write it down for people to read. Like this. If many people see this paper they'll want to buy sticks. I see. Smart. Yes. May I come visit your home later? - To begin, so I-I can... - Hey. Make me a stick. I'll trade you for it. Ka'kwet, you know better. Don't stir up trouble with the white man. Watch your step, redskin. Time to go. We won't sell to the little man with the big ego. - Savages. - I'm sorry. He's very rude. Is it alright if I still visit you later? It is a long way and not easy. Anything that's worth having is some trouble. That way. Past all fences. Go away from the ocean, to the dead tree. Find the thin water that moves travel upstream, until all around you is green trees. Walk with the water the way the sun goes down until the land goes flat and open. Our home is there. It sounds like a poetic paradise. We miss you at school this year. All the boys are so immature. I gotta get a business so fast. I bet my dad retires soon, leaves the whole enterprise to me. - You can't even add! - That's not true. That's not true. Privacy, please, Jane. Walk further behind. You're meant to chaperone, not eavesdrop. Ooh! Oh. Dear, this path is so rough. Allow me. You found us! It was just as you said! I enjoyed the journey and looking for clues. This... this is Belle, my friend. You can touch her. She won't hurt you. - What's your name? - Ka'kwet. Ka'kwet. Does it have a meaning? Uh, I love that your names describe the various characteristics. My name is for the... - sea-star. - Starfish? You must be very resilient. - What is your name? - Anne. Plain Anne. It doesn't mean anything, I'm sorry to say. Well, if I was an elder, I could choose your name. It would be... Melkitaulamun a strong and brave heart. When your eyes seek and your heart is open, that is true brave. Did I say something wrong? No, I-I love it. Thank you. Can you teach it to me? Mel-kita-ulamun. - Mel-kita-ulamun. - Good! Like to see the sticks now? I'd like to see everything. What things do you trade? We're known for our baskets. I love to weave. They're incredibly intricate. My favourite is chigajish. You would call it porcupine. Tell me what you eat. Fish, rabbits and eel. Our hunters are always busy. I read that your homes are called wigwams. Is that correct? Yes. They're made from birch bark and skins. My father made ours. And here are the sticks. You live in such harmony with nature. Thank you for letting me come. You welcome. Is that right, Ka'kwet? My mother, small brother and sister. Mimikej! Will you still be scared if I do this? You have pretty hair. Like soil. She says your hair looks like the earth. I think it looks like... fire. I appreciate your elemental compliments. I like my hair better now because of them. I love your hair ties. I usually wear my hair like yours. I love your colourful scarf! It's not perfect because I knit it myself. I made these ties also. - Shall we trade? - Wanna trade? Hello, everyone! Did you miss me? I missed you. Our hunters have returned from three days away. My mother is in charge of food. Welcome home. It's good to be back. But we're not so happy with our hunt. The catch was small. - Is it enough? - There's not enough game. Thank you for your efforts. The train brings too many hunters. You'll need to go out again in one sleep. Teach me more of your language. What's your word for family? Our words are not like yours. Our language is what we see and... - Notice? - Um... - Perceive? Observe? - Observe. I observe my father and brother. See this? I do it, too. Many things the same. So, we say. This is who I am connected to because we are so alike. So, you are a family. Wonderful. Does all of your family have your hair of fire? - I, um... - There. So pretty. Do you, uh, have a mirror? Um... - Something to see yourself? - Come. It's funny how people are so quick to point out differences when there's so many ways we're all alike. Alike. Ka'kwet! Time to help with supper! I have chores before evening meal. Oh! So do I. I should go. - Hello. - Anne. - You're late. - Sorry. Heavens! What's all that in your hair? You look like a heathen. And where's your scarf? Some Mi'kmaws stopped by the hockey game today and I made a trade. Indians? Did they threaten you? They're lovely people. Good weavers, I'll give them that. Hurry and bathe before supper. - I'll need flour before the weekend. - Mm. I'll send Jerry to get it tomorrow. Mmm... Why are you grinning like a Cheshire cat? No reason. You must contrive to get Billy to walk you home one more time and then I'll invite him to call. I'm worried Margaret has eyes for him. The little wretch followed his every move at the game. Snap him up, darling. Get your hooks in now so he can't escape. But he's not in school. How can I? In my day, we had a take-notice board. You take notice of someone you like or take notice of a flirtation and then you post it for everyone to see. It's a good way to announce a social pairing. Gracious heavenly Father as you recall, for some time now, I have sent you repeated prayers in the hopes that you'd make me good-looking when I grow up. Well, I'm turning 16 on Saturday and I now know that was a childish flight of fancy and not a proper prayer and I apologise. It seems to me that my destiny is to be the bride of adventure. I expect you approve because you've sent me on so many now that I've quite developed a taste for them. Rest assured, this isn't a capitulation because I'm not an ideal beauty for many suitors or even just one. But because, in my maturity I've come to the happy evolutionary opinion that I am unusual and I embrace it. But I do wonder who I'm like. If my parents were unique like me, in looks and in character. Despite the fact that they found each other. I wonder if it was a match made in heaven. I guess you would know. Please send them my love. That's the only thing I want. Amen. Hello, Walter and Bertha. Hello. In the nick of time. This fire's almost out. Bring that straight here, Sebastian, unless you want your eggs raw. Ah, shades of our sea-faring life, eh, Bash? "Feed the lady, Trinidad!" Remember that? Been hopin' to forget. How are you this morning, my pretty, pretty, pretty girl? How's every little thingy-wingy? There she is. There's Daddy's itty-bitty pretty baby. Hey. Ooh, ooh! Ooh, Deli. Hey... Breaky-wakey time for Gilby-goo. Huh, baby? Have a good day, Delfin. Bash, maybe you should try speaking English to her. Maybe, someday, she'll actually learn some. Ooh! Bah, bah, bye-bye-bye! Who's my clever bye-bye girl? Hey, my pretty, pretty girl. Oh, yes, you are. I know. - I see you, Deli. - Hi. Hi! I'm rather glad your doctor has advised you more exercise. Thank you for this escort to school, Rachel. Even though I love riding I should slow down more often. Good idea. Let's... slow down! I think the doctor is trying to kill me. Hello, dear geese! I love them so. Did you know they mate for life? I'm surprised you care. You certainly have no love of romance. I beg to differ. I had a life of love and fun with my exceptional husband. Our bond was very strong. It's not that I'm not romantic, Rachel. It's just after a year of grieving him, and solitude I've come through the other side feeling at home in myself. I don't need a husband. Although, I suppose it's fair to say I miss the nature of the companionship we had. Oh, my word. - I am restored! - My heavens. I am just the person you... Can't breathe. If... If I may be so bold, you may want to forego your corset next time. - Full lungs. - Loosen it! Just a little. Please. Hurry. Hurry! If you miss companionship, companionship you shall have. I know all the eligible young men, and not-so-young, from here to Carmody. Oh, you are in luck. Matchmaking is my specialty. Oh! Well, come along, Muriel. There's much to discuss. Courting. Oh, what fun! Oh, Diana! How will I ever live without you? Only 183 more days until we're torn apart! - Please don't go to Paris. - Please don't go to Queens. You'll meet new friends at finishing school and forget all about me. You'll be in college with everyone but me and I'll fade away. I swear you are the only bosom friend I will ever have, a letter a day. Do you think the Cuthberts have any special surprises planned for your birthday tomorrow? Even I can't imagine that. Do Matthew and Marilla seem like giddy tricksters to you? I can't believe mother's forcing the whole family to go to Carmody tomorrow. I so want to celebrate your special day with you. Not to worry. I'll have turned 16 and that's what counts. Sixteen! Anything could happen. Diana! Anne! Come see! Someone has resurrected the take-notice board with a post about me. - This is so exciting! - Isn't that scandalous? The scandal will be when folks find out it was you. You're a sly one, Jane, since I'm sure it was you who put this up. Who else might have seen me strolling home with Billy? Everyone will know now! Oh, dear. Then again, I supposed it's a good thing since we should all stake our claim on our paramours. The clock is ticking. At this age, we should all be promised to someone! Wouldn't want to wind up an old maid. Can that run in a family? I'm so confused! We're of age now, but Gilbert hasn't made any advances yet. Think of all the fresh eye-catching talent that will be at Queens next year. But I'm only going to Queens to be near Gilbert! Come on, Ruby. I bet I can help. Hm? - Hello, Anne. - Hi. Diana, your dress is very blue. A good blue. I-I mean, I... I like it. Moody, too close to the sun. - Good morning. - Morning. I'm not sure if you're aware but the old take-notice board is active again. Take-notice? Uh, yes, of someone. As in, you post on the board when you wanna let someone know that you've taken notice. It's a way to make a casual declaration quiet attention. - To someone you like? - Yes. Not so pointed as to be alarming and not so vague as to not be understood. - A post in advance of a proper advance? - Exactly. Because all these little notices matter when you wanna let someone know - that you're thinking ahead. - To a future together? Yes. So, you're suggesting... I post? If you're interested in Ruby, you should let her know before someone else stakes their claim. Thank you for the suggestion. But I'm not exactly a take-notice kind of guy. And, you know, when the right person comes along someday, whenever that is I'll know. I can't wait for someone to walk me. Did you see his face? I'm sorry, he's not going... Did you see his face when you were talking about me? His eyes were so full of romance. - I almost died happy right there and then. - His eyes? I firmly believe that his reluctance to post is a sign that he has true feelings for me and is waiting for a much more romantic way to approach me than that. Good morning, everyone. Perhaps we should begin with algebra today. Not very romantic, I know, but... maybe that's a good thing. "I felt emotions of gentleness and pleasure that had long appeared dead revived within me. 'Alf surprised by the novelty of these..." S-Sen... Sensat... Sensation? Sensations. Ah. Merci. "...sensations. I allowed myself to be blown away by them and..." You're becoming quite the young gentleman. He's a fine reader, too. Give my best to Mary and Bash. I always do. I enjoy these little visits. It's nice to be of use. Nice to cuddle that baby. Fiddlesticks. "I may die, but first you, my tyrant and tormentor!" I beg your pardon? No, no, Miss Cuthbert. It's the monster, Frankenstein. "And I can trace my grandfather's family line back to 1303 when my ancestor, Lord Pembroke, negotiated a famous peace treaty with Scotland on behalf of England. His daughter, Lady Charlotte, went on to wed the Earl of Canterbury. So, I have some very distant cousins in Kensington Palace." - That's it. - No wonder. Well done, Diana. No notes. None for me either. Besides to say that your lineage sounds like a fairy tale. There's so much scope for the imagination and yet it's real? What's wrong? My ancestry is keeping me from Queens from you, everything. Anne, I've just proofed your article on the Mi'kmaq Indians, and it's excellent. Now that our circulation is growing outside the confines of our school I'm sure everyone will be riveted. Oh...! But Anne's so wordy. It's the price you pay for your beautiful penmanship. But, take heart, I have some good news. I've got a line on a printing press. It's broken, but fingers crossed, I'll be able to repair it. Soon we'll be more than a school paper. We'll be publishing for all of Avonlea. Isn't that exciting? Let's see who's next on the getting-to-know-you beat. Anne Shirley-Cuthbert. "I am a mystery, shrouded in an enigmatic riddle. The end." I'm an orphan. I don't have any information about my lineage. - Just skip to the next person. - Of course. Charlie Sloane. Carry on, reporters. Anne, please come with me. I can imagine that was hard for you just now. - I'm sorry about that. - Oh, that's alright. Though I confess I have been wishing more and more that I did know my history or anything, really, about my family. You sure you're not upset? A very kind milkman at the asylum once told me that I was resilient and I expect he was right. I wonder if they know. The orphanage. They must have records about you. I've been wondering that myself. There. That should do it. Delfin really took to that bottle, didn't she? I know. I still can't believe it. And Mama's very grateful. Yes, she is. - I'll take her. - Thank you. Now, Daddy can help feed you, too. Since he's been so jealous. - There... - She's mostly just sleeping now. Oh, yes, ma'am. That bath tub's just calling my name. Mm. You have such a way with her. - She's a little miracle. - You're the miracle. Coming here three times a week. You're spoiling me, and I love you for it. I never knew what all the fuss was about until now. Although my Anne is such a blessing in our lives. It's her birthday, Saturday. - Sixteen. Can you quite believe it? - I can. It's all she talks about. Lord in Heaven, this is good! Alright. Queens study group stays, everyone else, have a nice weekend. Bye, Diana. It's unfair. Not only am I isolated from my friends I am receiving less education. I implore you to please reconsider. Finishing school won't actually give me a well-rounded education. If I went to Queens, at least I'd have a degree at the end of it. But not necessarily a husband. And I'd be with my friends. Doesn't current quality of life supersede future quality of life? You puzzle me. I will not entertain this conversation one more time. I'll go to Paris. Your complaints are despicable and ungrateful and I won't endure them. I said I'll go! She's simply too immature to understand the larger picture. Oh, well, that is evident. Do not vex me further. If you persist, I shall cancel tomorrow's special event. - Did Marilla head home? - She did indeed. I'm still damp. - Is this Gilbert's study group day? - It is. Is the baby sleeping? - Oh. Uh... - Anne is at study group. Uh, what happened here? Want me to clear this away for you... Don't touch that! Right, well. Hand it over, then off you go. Oh, Tillie! My, my! Tillie has been noticed twice. Who are you gonna walk home with first? Tillie! Did you forget what you wanted to say? Eyes... I... I! I... was... See you. Urgh! Good morning, dear Snow Queen! It's finally happened! I'm 16! Once upon a time, this was the happiest day of my parents' life. Anne! Well, set the table. Don't dally. Oh, hurry up. Please! Matthew, the fire's gone out! Come here at once! ♪ For she's a jolly good fellow ♪ ♪ For she's a jolly good fellow ♪ ♪ For she's a jolly good fellow ♪ ♪ Which nobody can deny ♪ And no one... ♪ Had better try! ♪ Um, now... you are too slippery for bad luck to catch you. A 50-cent piece? You spend it however you want. This cake... Even in my wildest imagination, and, admittedly, it's exceedingly wild I could not have imagined a more perfect cake than this. Blow the candle before it's ruined! Oh, Matthew. I cannot imagine what it cost. There's no controlling him when it comes to you. I figure you'll collect more and more charms... for all the Annes that you will become as you grow. This hat here... this represents the original Anne... that I met at the train station that day. That blessed day when fate brought us... together and we become a family. I love it. Thank you. The original Anne. And I feel extra-inspired now, to start the search for my true origin story. I want to learn about my family. I wanna know who made me, who came before. Whatever for? Didn't your parents die when you were an infant? They did. But I feel the need to know them... - to learn about my lineage. - It's unsafe. You'd have to go all the way to Nova Scotia. I can travel by train with Gilbert. He goes to Charlottetown every Saturday for his medical mentorship. Remember Cole? He lives with Aunt Jo in Charlottetown so he can escort me on the ferry and to the orphanage. It would only be a day. Please let me go? Would it make you happy? What... What... This is troubling, I daresay. Mm, I'll have to give it a lot of thought. Let's hear no more about it for now. Time to celebrate. Anne! Anne! What's wrong? What is it? This doesn't concern you. - What happened? Are... are you alright? - Leave me alone! - Did something bad happen? - Ugh! It's a prank. For Anne's birthday! Stop making a fuss and play along. T'es trop belle. Let's go! Help! Help! Diana needs Anne! Anne! Come quick! Her parents are dead! What? Jerry! That's not true. Minnie May is sick again and you knew just what to do last time. - Uh... - You have to come. This has nothing to do with Anne's birthday. Please, Anne. - May I go? - Well, indeed you must. Here. Thank you. Go, go, go, go, go! - There they are! - Hurry! Hurry! Surprise! Surprise! I hope you were worried sick about me. Come on. Were you surprised? Happy birthday! We have so many treats! Wow! You did all this? It's all for you. Mm! And then... And then Jerry yells, "Her parents are dead!" - He almost ruined the whole thing! - I know. Why are boys so maddening? Why don't they know anything? - What is the matter with boys? - Mm, I know. Some of us prefer men. Mmm! Some of you, and by you, I mean Tillie have a two-boy problem. That's not a problem. As a brave girl who seeks with my eyes and heart open I'm letting you know here and now that I plan only to be the bride of adventure. I never know what you're talking about. I'm a conscientious objector of the status quo. See? It happened again! ♪ Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday... ♪ Oh! Princess Minnie May has weakened! More cake, good women, before she doth perish! Oh, let us attend to our fair maiden! Oh, please, take my delectable offer! No... No. No. No. No... Yeah. I'm still concerned for her safety. Hm, she's made that journey before. Well, true enough. So, then we're agreed? We are. Anne! Come to the parlour, please. - Now, we have given the matter... - Considerable thought. And we have come to a decision. We will support your search to learn of your lineage. If you feel a powerful need for it. But you must be chaperoned and kept safe. You must take responsibility for this venture. Write to Cole and arrange his escort and assure that you can travel with Gilbert. I will. I will! Thank you, thank you, thank you! I love you both so much. Oh, you're both scrumptious. This is the happiest birthday I have ever, ever had. I'm less worried about the journey than I am about her heart. What if she finds out something that she doesn't wanna know? What if... there's a distant relative to claim her after all? What if... What if she leaves us? We agreed. We want her to be happy. Well, that's the best we can do. Who is Anne with an E?
