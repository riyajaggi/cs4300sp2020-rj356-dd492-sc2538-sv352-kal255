 Hey. Don't worry, little one. You are intended for bigger things. Some inspiration, Blythe. After three days, even you must have a taste to make something different. A bit drastic, isn't it? Calm yourself. I ain't that desperate yet. Don't forget the salt. Now, that's just ungrateful. Hi. Since you can't go outside to meet spring, I brought spring to you. Close your eyes.

 Happy Easter-is-coming surprise! Is this what you call dropping a whole chicken coop in my lap? False vex. I see you smiling. It's your first Easter isn't it, Delly? We'll do it up right. Hot-cross buns. A homemade kite. We used to fly them on the beach after church. Your girls might like that. And maybe baby's first bobolee? You cannot put another one of those things out on the front yard. Imagine, making a stuffed Judas Iscariot and then beatin' on it. It's a Trinidadian tradition. It's kinda funny. It's terrifying. You hear that, Delphine? No bobolee for you. What if we ask Uncle Gilbert if he wants a bobolee? Gilbert. Please tell me he is not...

 He's not. More like stirring. Oh! Sweet heaven, no. I have to get up. Three days of oatmeal is three days too many. On the third day, Jesus rose. But you're not going nowhere, my love. You have a fever. I should be getting better. It's time to bring the doctor. I'll ask Gilbert to fetch him. Do you think she could catch this? Whatever this is? Matthew, good morning. We have a favour to ask. ♪ First thing we'd climb a tree ♪ ♪ And maybe then we'd talk ♪ ♪ Or sit silently ♪ ♪ And listen to our thoughts ♪ ♪ With illusions of someday ♪ ♪ Casting a golden light ♪ ♪ No dress rehearsal ♪ ♪ This is our life ♪ ♪ You are ahead by a century ♪ ♪ You are ahead by a century ♪ This won't do. I should fold it over again, don't you think? It's fine, Anne. Thank you. May I use the oven on Saturday? I'm making roast chicken again for Mary's Easter gathering. It's becoming our tradition. She's been a wonderful culinary tutor. So supper will yet again be a bracingly spicy affair. So I shouldn't make it. Is that your edict? There is no edict, Anne. It's just not what I'm used to. - Watch your step now. - That is my intention. Steady as she goes. Out of the road, Matthew. How long has Mary been sick? Uh... I don't rightly know. A few days? What did Sebastian say, exactly? Mind the baby. We know that part. Silly. I'm going over there, assess the situation. Sure and certain they'll need more help than just the baby. I'll come with you before school. Uh, in case Delly needs changing. Changing? Uh... Milk, bottles, pot, stove, if she gets hungry. If she cries, it's always either a bottle or a nappy. Or both. But she'll probably just sleep. - I'll be home in a couple of hours. - Hours? Is it very serious? Well, the doctor could answer that better than me, but hopefully not. I think it's shameful that the only doctor that will see her - is all the way in Charlottetown. - I agree. Illness doesn't discriminate. Thankfully, neither does Dr. Ward. He's a good man. Off you go, Gilbert, before you miss your train. Oh. Morning, Miss Marilla, Anne. Sorry to intrude, Sebastian, but we felt the need to stop by and offer our assistance. Please tell me you'll cook. We'll make some broth, bake a quick loaf, and be on our way. - And... where's my baby? - Oh, sleeping. Matthew's watching her. Barn. The barn. Tree. Tree! Horse! Horse. Goat. Goat... Ooh, Jerry. Jerry! This here's... Delphine. Aw. The nappy. I-I will show you. It-it-it's easy. I thought you left with Marilla. I did. And I circled back. I felt compelled to transform her plain broth into a more robust soup to entice your appetite. Cooking behind her back? Aren't you all kinds of 16-year-old trouble. Mm. That's nice. But did you forget to toast the paprika like I showed you? I did. And I've nothing but my own subterfuge and excitement to blame. You're learning. That's what's important. It's very tasty. It's time for you to get to school, Trouble. Come tomorrow, we'll decide what you'll bake for the county fair. Perfect. Feel better. Bye! I'll have this later. Let me get you a blanket. You're trembling. The Barrys aren't coming to Easter supper. I'm not surprised. They didn't come last year. We don't need to beg friends. Those who accept us are those who accept us. It's not about begging friends. In the Bog, it was a way to thank my neighbours. I used to work so much when Elijah was little and... now, I miss cooking for more people than I can count on my two hands. We have plenty of time for you to find a way to bring Avonlea to your dinner table. Now, what cloth should we use for this kite? That fabric there on the sewing basket. It's so pretty I can't let it go to waste. Same as the curtains you made for Delly's nursery. I'll put them up as soon as I'm free of this bed. It will look like the sun in sky. Typesetting takes so long. - What comes next? - The blocks. Charlie, you're such a know-it-all. - At least you noticed. - Easy, Josie. - Easy. - Keep calm and take a lesson. My turn. Nice, easy motion. Slides right in. And now I pull the devil's tail. Such a scandalous name. - Open it, open it. How does it look? - Oh my goodness, I hope this works. - It worked! - The Avonlea Gazette. Just like magic. Moody. "Farmers Celebrate New... Gilbert." Again, Ruby? Don't look at me like that! I'm preoccupied. Why isn't he here? He went to fetch the Charlottetown doctor. Bash's wife isn't well. Oh, Lord have mercy. You don't even know that coloured woman. Mary is a smart, lovely woman, but you'd know that if you ever said two words to her. Gilbert is so heroic. Here, Ruby... for your poor eyes. Ooh...! Are you "taking notice" of this, Diana? I certainly am. It's true, I am beautiful when I cry. Or so I've been told. You should keep it. If you like. Hello there. Mr. Bones, look who's here on a weekday. Winnie, I need to speak to Dr. Ward, if possible. Of course. Gilbert. What's troubling you? You remember my friend Sebastian? His wife is very sick. - She's been bedridden for days. - Tell me what's going on. She has a fever. There's been some nausea, vomiting. And... she's got this... strange rash, like pinpricks, or a cluster of tiny blood spots. I'll need you to reschedule all of my appointments tomorrow. I'll catch the first train. Excuse me, I need to get back. - Thank you, Dr. Ward. - I'll see you in the morning. Origin is so strange. Isn't it? Oh, were I not an orphan and been in service for so many years, I'd be far less equipped to tend to this little one now. Sometimes life hides gifts in the darkest of places. Indeed. Yip! Oh! Bop! Bop! Bop! Bop! I'm not following. There has to be something you can do. I understand your frustration. I'll walk you out. A week. Maybe two. Bash? Sebastian? I'll go. Sorry about that. Something fell. Bash is dealing with it. Oh. Can you translate for me? The doctor said I have something called... sepsis? What is it? What's the cure? Sepsis... is a kind of infection. I was afraid of that. What about Bash and Delphine and you? Is it contagious? - We'll be fine. - That's a relief. So he'll come back with some kind of medicine? When? Because I am tired of this bed, and I've got baking to do. He's not coming back. Right. I just need to ride this out, then. How much longer, do you think, until I start feeling better? I... You're... I'm so sorry, Mary. What? - Are you sure? - There's nothing that we can do. I see. Sebastian. I need to see Delphine right now. Gilbert... Could you please bring our baby home to us? I think I'll walk. May I join you? Suit yourself. I... can't fathom it. I don't think I can be a doctor. Doctors are supposed to... I was... I had to tell her, but I... - Oh, Gilbert. - No, don't. I'm not the one dying. I'm not the one who's losing everything. I'm just... A friend who delivered the most terrible news to someone they love. Mary needed me to be strong. I just made it worse. I couldn't find the words and I made it worse. Would she have been consoled by some dispassionate delivery? I hope you never have to do something like that again, but I don't think you'll be able to avoid it. People will come to you, Gilbert. And they will bring their children, and everyone they hold dear, to see a doctor who cares just as much as they do. You will be a wonderful doctor. Caring deeply will always be the right thing. Oh. Hi. Hi. The doctor could be wrong. My mother knows bush medicine. I'll write to her. Bash, please. Please what? Give up? Where's Anne? I need to talk to her. She'll be here soon. If you need anything... Anything at all. Anne... Please help me understand you, if you don't mind. You were Delphine's age when you were orphaned? - That's true. - You never complain, but from what you told me, you had it rough before you came here. And yet, you're the way you are. Loving, bright, tender. You're very kind. It wasn't the sunniest time, but... it could've been much worse. - How so? - My parents. I didn't know them... but I believed in them. It sounds strange, I know, but... I believed they loved me. I clung to that. Delphine won't have my experience. She'll have Bash. And us. She will know for certain that she is loved. But she won't know me. She won't know how much I cherish her. Tell her. Write her a letter. Fill it with all that is in your heart, share your life, tell her everything about you. That would be the most incredible gift. That's something I've longed for all my life, to know my mother, my father, to know for sure that they loved me. Give her that, Mary, and I promise you it will make all the difference. Chop-chop, ladies. The Lord was resurrected in less time than it's taken us to decorate this church. Gentle with the drapery, dear. Ladies of the church, I present a federal Indian Affairs agent who brings word from the mainland. Good afternoon. The government has generously opened a new residential school in Halifax. Residential? A boarding school? Specifically designed to address the matter of savages living in our midst. Solve the Indian problem. I've seen a few of them lurking about here selling their wares. Our aim is to educate the heathens in all things civilized. We accept the children, those young enough to still be saved, and offer lodging, and instruction in language, culture... and especially religion. It would be my Christian duty to make this known to our own local Indians when they turn up again. What the devil brings you two here? We have news. - I'm not leaving you to go to any Bog. - It will only take a day. That's if I find him quick, but I probably wouldn't find him at all. He stole things from Gilbert's father that cannot be replaced. Yes, what Elijah did was wrong. If I could get Gilbert's heirlooms back, I would. If I could go to Charlottetown myself, I would. Why? He hurt you. - He needs me. - If you want him to feel forgiveness, - they have priests for that. - I'm his mother. I need him to understand how much he is loved. - I need to see my son. - Say I actually find him, and bring him back here, how will he act? You think he'll be happy to see you this way? I don't want to fight with you anymore. I'm so tired. That's why I have to say no. I can't be away from you and Delly. Not now. Not for any amount of time. Understand? Can you ask Gilbert to come in here, please? I'm not proud of myself, asking you to do this, after all that's happened. I'll find him... if I can. I appreciate you so much, Gilbert Blythe. You're a big part of my life, I'll have you know. You found my husband, a man I couldn't imagine, on a ship in the middle of the ocean... and you brought him home. Not as a partner or a friend... but as a brother. Some folks don't understand what you two are, and most aren't even capable of it... but I am grateful... knowing Bash is safe with you. Thank you... for bringing love back into my family's home. That girl you mentioned? Be sure you marry for love. Only for love. What are you scratching away at over there? I'm writing down every recipe Mary ever had or taught me. I plan to take Delphine under my wing. We're kindred in a way I never understood kindred could be. That's a lovely legacy, Anne. Hmm. Finally. I heard there was a white man with no interest in the bawdy house roaming around. I'm looking for Elijah Hanford. - Do you know him? - Yes. - Do you know where I can find him? - I know exactly where he is. But does it matter when I get more of what you want at a better price? I have important family news. - Can you help me? - Yes, and no. He's long gone. Came into some money, booked passage on a ship to America. Hmm. You're sure? Gotta be in New York by now. Not what you wanted to hear, eh? Well, have a drink. - It'll take the sting out. - No, but thank you. Much obliged. "Family news" must be the new way to say "the law." Everybody... Next round's on me. - I was told that he left town. - Poor Mary. Tomorrow I'll ask Mr. Edwards for an advance on my wages. We'll hire a carriage and we'll go see her. - If that's alright with you. - Of course, yes. But allow me to escort you on the train. I'm taking the next one back. Please... God. Please... Please. How many more? Let's make it abundant. Thank you so much for carrying our bags. Makes my head spin. Look at the size of this kitchen. - Beautiful. - Constance! Jocelyn! How extraordinary to be ambushed by such affably familiar faces! Does that mean she's happy to see us? You've grown since the wedding. Mary wrote that you've been a big help to her, Miss Marilla. Oh, she's become a special friend. Can we offer you ladies something after your long trip? - We'd just like to see our Mary. - At the end of the hall, on the left. Thank you. Listen. We are here to take care of Mary. No more crying. I mean it. Okay. You two are not the headstrong husband I was expecting to walk through that door, but I'm glad to see you, my laundry sisters! Mary. - We came as soon as we heard. - Oh... - Where's Elijah? - We don't know where he is. I'll have to write him that letter, then. Will you keep it and give it to him when he turns up? You gave that boy everything. He's so wayward. It still wasn't enough. Oh... Sorry, I know he's your one son. No, you're right. But you could at least wait until I'm gone before you knock my mothering skills. - What can we do? - Bring me the Bog. - You remember why we call it the Bog? - I do. But Avonlea's so different. We had problems in the Bog, but black or white, being poor made us one big community. I miss that. There are some white people in your kitchen. - How many do you need? - They seem like good white people, - but are they good white people? - They're good white people. There's a baby in here! You haven't met my Delphine. - Mary... - I need to hold that baby. Me first. Oh, hello. Bash. Bash! Bash! Mary's asking for you. Your father. When he was... near the end... you took him on a train across Canada. What made you strong enough in the face of it? Don't know that I was strong. He wanted it, so I did it. How did you take... knowing... that he was almost... gone? I tried not to think about it, really, which was impossible. But we were together, we would just talk, he would tell me stories. That made it better. - I don't know how things can be better. - Well, that's 'cause it can't. It's awful. You can be angry about it later, but right now, spend every last minute that you can with her. 'Cause, Bash... if you don't, I swear you'll regret it. - How will I live without her? - You'll figure it out. And hey... I'll be right here. Oh, and we should make some of Mary's scalloped potatoes, too. - Haven't had them in an age. - Oh, I second that. They're divine. What that woman can do with buttermilk is confounding. Is it two parts... No, one part? Oh, here we go again. You never get it right. Uh, I have the recipe. Praise the Lord, child. Oh... - Well, hello. - Seems like quite the party that I've stumbled onto, accidentally, without an invitation. Hello, Rachel. These are Mary's dear friends from Charlottetown, Constance and Jocelyn. Well, I... I'm sorry to meet you under such sad circumstances. It's very kind of you to come to see... our poor Mary... Ah. Well, I never. Well! Looks like we got good cooks aplenty in this pretty town. You've quite a feast already. Goodness me, whatever will you do with all this food? We have an idea that we were talking about earlier. We want to do something for our Mary. She would never think to ask for it herself. You beautiful garden would be the perfect place. Will you lend it? Please? We wouldn't dream of declining such a request. And we'll help with the preparations, of course. - Oh... - You're both very kind. It'll be beautiful. I promise. Say, "Hello, Papa." Hi, my loves. It's a very fine stick. Thank you. I hope you play well. What are the savages... - Easter is so pretty. - Excuse me! You there. Indians. My husband, Thomas Lynde. And I am Rachel Lynde. I bring you glad tidings from our government. There's a boarding school in Halifax. They would teach you to read and write English, and all sorts of things. School in the city. It could be fun. That city is all the way across the water. Who would take care of our child? These whites are changing everything. The land, the hunting, how we trade. Precisely. They take too much already. Maybe learning their ways will help the community. Do your parents like the idea? - Big fight. - I don't trust it. We'll talk more of this another time, not here. - We will think on it. - Ah. Well, there you go, dear heart. You may well have saved some Indians today. - Oh. - I made one the same for me. Because we are so alike. - Can you tell me about school? - Oh. I'd be happy to, but I can't just now. I'll come and visit you soon. Momma's gonna write you a letter, and your father's gonna give it to you when you're older. I have no idea when the right time is for a girl to get a message from her dead mother. A part of me wishes I didn't know. Maybe if Delphine was a little older, or if I were just... old... it wouldn't be so hard. I know. I don't want to die. I don't know how it will be for you after all of this. It's so hard to raise a baby when you're alone. That's why you need more than a friendship. You need community. I know you're scared too, but you can do it. Never forget that she is yours... and you are hers. Her father. I know you'll keep Delphine safe the whole of your life. There's... so many things I want for her. Ready? I'm about to get bossy. Delphine will go to school, and don't let nobody stand in her way. As far as she can, college and whatever comes after that. If that's what she wants. - Put savings aside. - I've already started. Of course you have. Sebastian Lacroix, my great love. Maybe it's a gift to know so we can talk like this, even if it's the last thing either of us wanted. This way, we don't leave anything unsaid. Oh... Oh! Hello, hello, hello! Beautiful. Are you interested in another Easter surprise? It's stunning. - They're here! They're here! - Oh! Welcome to your Easter, Mary. Happy Easter, Mary. Happy Easter. Oh! - There you go. - Thank you, Constance. Thank you, my friend. And this is for Delphine. You're an angel, Anne Shirley Cuthbert. - Hello. - I brought this one. The turquoise one. Hello. Thank you. Aw! So sweet! That's fit for a princess. She looks like a chocolate candy. You're right, Minnie May. She is a pretty little chocolate princess. Hello, you sweet baby girl. She tastes very sweet. She is sweet. Aren't you? Yes! Wah! You are sweet. Yes, you are. ♪ When peace like a river ♪ ♪ Attendeth my way ♪ ♪ When sorrows like sea billows roll ♪ ♪ Whatever my lot ♪ ♪ Thou hast taught me to know ♪ ♪ It is well ♪ ♪ It is well with my soul ♪ Bash, did you do this? The community brought itself to you. ♪ It is well with my soul ♪ ♪ With my soul ♪ ♪ It is well it is well ♪ ♪ With my soul ♪ I don't know how to thank you all. I'll just read my favorite prayer, if that's alright. "Lord... make me an instrument of your peace. Where there is hatred... let me sow love." "Where there is injury, pardon. Where there is doubt, faith." "Where there is despair, hope. Where there is darkness, light. Where there is sadness, joy. O divine master, grant that I may not so much seek to be consoled... as to console. To be loved as to love. For it is in giving that we receive. It is in pardoning that we are pardoned. And it is in dying that we are born to eternal life." Ah!
