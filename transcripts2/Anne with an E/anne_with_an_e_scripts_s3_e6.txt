 ♪ You are ahead by a century ♪ My word, I felt the house shake that time. Now, where was I? A cold in the head at the start of summer vacation is an immoral thing. As are chatty distractions when a red ribbon is on the line. But nothing short of absolute pneumonia could quench my interest in culinary matters this morning. I am determined to do Mary proud at the fair tomorrow. Of course, cakes have such a terrible habit of turning out bad just when you especially want them to be good. You can start by not sneezing in the batter. Now please try not to distract me. These plum puffs must remain famous, not infamous. You have nothing to fear, Marilla. You win your category every year.

 Wouldn't it be wonderful if we had a Green Gables sweep? Your plum puffs, my "Mary" cake, and Matthew's... Whoo!! Mercy on us! What was that? Oh... no. The vanilla! Matthew! Are you alright? Goodness me! Oh, Mr. Cuthbert, that is the biggest radish I ever seen. I reckon your friend Jack may take a backseat this year. Please, please, please, please... Yes! What about this one? It looks like a white shirt. Same as every other white shirt you've tried on. This one requires cufflinks. Which I don't have since Elijah made off with my father's. Boy, I could knit you a shirt in the time it's taking you to decide. This white shirt is the key to making a good first impression with Winifred's parents. Can you tell the difference? Hmm? Blythe, you are as skittish as a bride! But your mother wasn't skittish. She was a woman who knew her mind. Showing you how to knit, too. Uh-oh. I think knit when I should have pearled. Ta-dah! So does all this fuss here mean you've settled on Winnie? Oh... no. She's easy to be with. I mean... I'm fond of her. - Fond enough to marry her? - I'm not thinking that far ahead. All I'm saying... Mary and I went for a couple walks and next I knew, I was drunk in a laundry basket, proposing. Winnie doesn't have those kinds of expectations. I don't know how you white folks do it... but once parents get involved, she's thinking about marriage. I need to change. Beautiful. It's perfect for tomorrow. Are you sure it's not too fancy for the fair? You don't want one of those East Grafton girls catching Billy's eye. The county fair is a hunting ground for spinsters who have run out of options in their own towns. I wonder if we could get away with a corset. Mother! I'm not yet 17. People will talk. Hmm. Pity. It would give you such an elegant shape. I don't want to cause a scandal! Don't touch them! Well, forgive me for... I'm sorry... Marilla, but... I want to win... solely on my own merit. Well, it looks fine to me. It's perfect. Oh, I wish Mary could see it. I've never made anything perfect before. I'm sure she's smiling from heaven. Hi there. Is Matthew home? I was hoping to borrow a pair of cufflinks. Have you been... chopping onions? - I-I... - My, that radish is spectacular! Gilbert needs cuff links! Cuff links? Cuff links, eh? Special occasion? Oh, I... No, not really. Oh, it was excruciating! I've never been more embarrassed! I can think of a few other examples. And since when do you care what Gilbert Blythe thinks? I don't! Why did he have to catch me in such a disastrous state? He, on the other hand, looked as if he'd just galloped out of the pages of a novel. What a splendid chin he has. I never noticed it before. A splendid chin? - Yeah. - Choose. Wearing a special dress tomorrow will do wonders for your beleaguered soul. You never know who you'll meet at the fair. Why do you think he needed cufflinks? They aren't an everyday item. Maybe it was an excuse. - To see you. - Hmm. Like when a boy goes out of his way to walk you home, even though it's forbidden. Bless you, dearest of Dianas, but what are you talking about? Um, you remember when Cole said he thought Gilbert had a crush on you? It's not true. Could it be true? "My name is Diana Barry. I don't want to go to finishing school in Paris!" I always put my foot in it with Gilbert. Always. "Paris is boring, and so am I." The only time I didn't was at dance practice, and that's because I couldn't find any words at all, just very confusing feelings. Feelings? Do tell. It was like a veil... hanging before my inner consciousness... was suddenly lifted... and I was Elizabeth Bennet dancing with Mr. Darcy. Every time our hands touched, it was... I think he felt it too. Because his eyes were... "I'm reading a monster book." Grrr! Minnie May, get out! His eyes! That's what Ruby observed when I was telling him about the Take Notice Board. When we danced, he was gazing at me like... Anne, I'm going to ask you a question. Don't be vexed and do answer earnestly. Do you have a crush on Gilbert? Anne? Might as well call to the wind. He loves me... He loves me not. Perhaps love unfolds out of a burgeoning friendship, as a golden-hearted rose slips from its green sheath... He loves me... But what if romance spoils our friendship? I won't let it. Maybe it's better if he doesn't love me. Next to true love, the best thing is unrequited love. It's even more romantic when you think about it. All the great stories are about unrequited love. In fact, I hope he doesn't love me. You're right as always, Belle. I don't know what I want. Bottles. Nappies. Pram, if Uncle Gilbert ever gets it loaded into the buggy. It is going to fit. I'll drop you off at the fair before I head to Bright River. Unless you want us to come with you. What do the courtship rules say about introducing your black family? One variable at a time. Ah. You alright? You seem... tense. Argh. I'm not tense! I'm just going to enjoy the day. What do I have to offer as a suitor anyway? I'm an orphan. My home life is... complicated. You can't cook. Sorry, I thought we were listing things. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Island Fair! Step this way! Right this way, little lady. - Simply thrilling! - It's a death trap. Pie-baking contest right through this way in the tent! Welcome to the fair. Come on, step right this way. Representing our little Avonlea in front of the entire... Well, usually it would make me tremble to think of, but... with Mary's recipe, I know I will distinguish myself. I must admit I'm surprised you made such a sensible cake. It doesn't have your usual flair. Ah. You shouldn't have shared your secret Plum Puff recipe, Marilla. You wouldn't. Oh. Oh! You're right. I value our friendship too dearly. And my life. Oh. This is for you. I set mine down already. So far, I don't see a bigger one. Matthew Cuthbert. How's by you, Jack? Well, you know... - Good spring. - Mm-hmm. Uh... I tried the, uh... elder leaves, - for the... - Ah. - You know... - Ugly white grubs. Yeah. Two peas in a pod. Finished! Now it's a feast for the eyes as well as the palate. Oh, and I'm number 16! - Quite a good omen, I'd say. - Here's... - For whatever suits your fancy. - Thank you! Be back in an hour for the cake competition. Wild horses couldn't stop me. A fortune teller. Madam Lyudmila, I'll dive right in. I'm in desperate need of answers. Well, you've come to the right place. I'm looking for a sign. I tried consulting a daisy. Several... daisies, actually. Ah, you're here for romance. Ah... That's why you're wearing this dress. You hope to impress a boy today. How did you...? - Do you see a boy? - Lucky for you... ...my intuition is better than flower. Wait. Hmm? Ah-ha-ha! You see, the round shape represents the ability to see from all directions: past, present, future. Future? What if... what if it's bad? Oh... I'm sure only good news on a fine day such as this. But you can't just tell me what I want to hear either. That would be a far worse thing. I am only here to help guide you to true path. You must trust. Now... Think about your question very clearly. Mm... hmm-hmm-hmm. Now mystic spirits will... Hey! - Name. - Uh, Anne. With an E. Hmm. Will Annie... find true love? Yes...! That will be 10 cents. I mean no offense, Madam, but I think I learned more from the daisy. Do you see nothing else? Ah. There is one face... who follows you with... curiosity. When he looks at you, his eyes overflow, like two cups... - filled above the brim. - His eyes? Can you see his face? Am I there? Am I older? Does my hair look more auburn? Who is he? He... Ah... I'm... I'm getting. He... Oh! He's tall... dark... very handsome. - And good dancer. - Say that again. Ten cents. Oh. Hello, sweet Delly. We're all set with my exporter. You boys will make a pretty penny. Those apples of yours will be sure to capture the English market. - Bonjour! Hey, hello again! Madame! - Nice to see you! Hey, Monsieur! Hello! Diana! I just had my fortune told, and she said that my true love would be a good dancer. It sent shivers down my spine when she said it. I know you're too sensible to believe in oracles, but even you must admit this cannot be a coincidence! Maybe he's my destiny. Uh... your destiny? Gilbert. Oh... Gilbert. I think we're meant to be to... Come along, Diana. We must extricate ourselves from that family. Otherwise, our day at the fair will be quite ruined. Oh. How could she let such a good thing get away? Ah, well. We'll just put our heads together and find someone for your son. - Yeah. - I meant me. She'll never get herself a beau without my help. There she is now. - Oh! - Oh, my. Oh, my. I see what you mean. She doesn't always wear trousers. She's really quite an exceptional person. Can't always judge a book by its cover, now can we? - Hmm. - Mm-mm. No luck. Guess it's not my day. May I claim my consolation prize? - Ice cream, my sweet? - Oh. We have a winner! Step right up! Test your strength! - Who are the men among the boys? - Give me that. - This is for my girl. - You can do it, Billy. - Josie looks lovely today. - Hmm. She's been catching many an eye. The children are clearly fond of each other. Of course, marriage is about more than happiness. Rest assured, we've invested greatly in Josie's future. I've given Billy the upper farm - on the condition that he marry laterally: a woman of fortune or connection. Remind me of your family's associations. Here I thought the cattle auction didn't start till noon. One step closer to expanding our happy family. You've missed a lot. Hopefully they settle things soon. I have my own pressing business with Father. - Another beau? - Don't be daft. College opened my eyes to a bold future. I have big plans for myself and the entire Andrews enterprise. Can't you just picture it? You and Billy running the family business side by side for years and years, Billy adding and subtracting on his fingers and toes. And we have a winner! - Oh! - Pick your prize. This stupid game is rigged. You were so close. I can't believe how hard you hit it. I'd like to try. We have a winner! - Come pick your prize. - Come on, I'll buy you something. Anything you want. Name it. - She's a winner! - Well done, sweetheart. Utter domination. I'm not done yet. And another. Close your eyes. I won this for you. Thank you, Jerry. Very pretty. May I give you a kiss? Whoa! Snake-oil liniment! Cure what ails you. Losing hair? Get it back! Why bother with medical school when there's that fellow, eh? Maybe I should study with him. Cost less than the Sorbonne. Ooh, the Sorbonne. So that's your destiny? In my dreams. I expect it'll be good old Queens College. I was reading in The London Times about groundbreaking immunology research being done at the Sorbonne, and if I'm going to stick with medicine, that's the area I'd want to pursue. That's not to mention all those pretty young clerks. Sir? What exactly are your intentions with my daughter? Oh, no, I... I... I jest. - Honestly, Nigel. - Heh. Uh, call it my hobby. One that my wife endures most stoically. Hardly. And as for Winifred, I trust my daughter. If she's happy, I'm happy. Can we please just enjoy the day? - Doesn't sound very happy. - And whose fault is that? If you do need some help getting into medical school, I happen to be good friends with Tommy Sorbonne. Tommy Sorbonne? Old college drinking buddies? Winnie, he's on to me. I see now where she gets her sense of humour. All joking aside, I do know some people over there. If you're interested, I'd be more than happy to send a telegram. Oh. Uh... there's someone I'd like you all to meet. Sebastian! I'm glad to see you looking so much... less pummeled. Feeling less pummeled, too, thank you, Miss Winifred. - Ice cream all around, folks? - Yes, on me. Sebastian Lacroix, may I introduce you Mr. and Mrs. Rose. - Pleasure to meet you. - And you. - How do you do? - Sebastian is my partner in the farm. And... my family. And who is this pretty girl with the ooey-gooey ice-cream face? - My daughter, Delphine. - Oh... I was just about to head over to the cake competition. Anne made Mary's recipe and I'm betting it'll knock the judges' socks off. - Shall we all walk over together, then? - That's a splendid idea. You were right about one thing: it's a fine day! I want my money back! All predictions are final. You said he was my true love! - And now this upsets you? - I'm surprised you can tell! Your powers of perception being what they are! I am only messenger. I cannot control fate, nor what I am told about it. What were you told exactly?! What did you see in your brilliant crystal ball? Because I'll tell you what I saw! My "true love" walking arm and arm with another girl No... not a girl, a woman. The universe works in mysterious ways. I thought you saw him! Saw us! I was going to be an "us." I feel so foolish. I wanted to believe you. To think it was true that someone could look at me that way. I never even dared to hope before, but you... Oh, to be 15 again. - Sixteen. - Take heart. I fell in love plenty times at your age. You'll find there are many more fish in the sea. I would've settled for one. You don't need a third eye, not when you have your own two. You saw what you saw. That boy is not your fish. Where is she? Oh. You're just in time. They haven't tasted Anne's "Mary" cake yet. - Gilbert, have you seen Anne? - I haven't. - I-I'd like to introduce you to... - I'm here. I'm here. I'm... Oh. This is Anne, my classmate and family friend. Hello, Anne. Do you spell it with or without an E? Anne, this is my, uh... Uh, Winifred. - Entry number 16. - Ooh. It's you, Anne. Your cake. It's a wonderful presentation. It's the Lake of Shining Waters. It's a little ostentatious. Dear God! - What is that? - That flavoring. It tastes like liniment! Oh. Anne! Anne! It's fine. I'm fine. Honestly. I wish you two every happiness. I... was just going to say that... Mary would've found that really, really funny. Right. Thanks. We have a winner! Snake-oil liniment! Who are the men among the boys? Well, now, it... It should be here. Ah. Congratulations, Jack. It's a... it's a mighty fine cabbage. Um... I reckon I, uh... I saw your name on that radish down there, with the, uh... the Most Unusual vegetables. - Most Unusual? - Mm-hmm. Ah, well... I don't think I've ever grown one bigger. Wood ash. Helps the soil retain moisture. Hmm. "Most Unusual." I should've entered myself into this category. I would've won. I figure this is a badge of honor. There you are! The judges all tried to get my recipe - again. Cheer up, Anne. Your cake was a work of art. And Mary, bless her soul, would've laughed and laughed. This has been far from a prize-winning day in every regard. What else has gone so terribly wrong? Can we please just go home? Perhaps you need a change of perspective. We are... literally... going to hell in a hand basket. Might I remind you whose idea this was? - I knew Anne would like it, but now... - Ah! We'll never forget this for the rest of our lives! That's just what we were discussing. I simply cannot die... fly, without knowing one thing. How on earth did you manage to get liniment into the cake? - I only added what the recipe said. - What flavouring did you use? Vanilla. But... I broke the bottle. So I had to use the spare one from the pantry. Oh, dear. I believe it's my fault. I broke the liniment bottle ages ago and poured what was left into an old, empty vanilla bottle. And I couldn't smell it because I had such a cold. Oh, you are an unlucky girl, Anne, there's no doubt about that. I'm not unlucky. I'm "Most Unusual." Oh, dear Lord! My! Matthew! Oh, my... Anne, Anne, hold on now. Hold on. Matthew look! Oh, Marilla, look down, look down! This is quite the contraption. - Look, they're going up! - It's spectacular! Oh, look how marvellous it is!

She must be from Charlottetown. Maybe she was his patient. Did he make her well? Uh, I need some fresh air. Oh, my, I'm so excited for the next dance! Billy? Over here. I told my father I don't care about the money. You don't? All I need is your pretty face. We should go back inside. They'll be wondering where we are. Oh, come on! Stay. Uh... We really shouldn't.

He says he's never written a song before. You and Josie? Guess she couldn't wait for the wedding. I could be Ruby Spurgeon! Moody and Ruby almost rhyme. Next dance is The Circassian Circle. Whoo-whoo! All aboard! Hello, Anne. Might I, uh... - Should we dance? - I'd love to. Charlie, would you consider yourself to be a good dancer? Matthew, would you care to join me for this next dance?

That's not what happened, and you know it! How dare you spread nasty rumors about my friend?! You weren't there. You don't know what you're talking about. I have eyes, and I can see that she is devastated. You shouldn't have touched her, Billy! Well... I guess she regrets having loose morals. Josie! Is it really so bad? They're practically engaged. Were. - Billy had no right, regardless! - None of us saw what happened. Besides, Josie's always been ill-bred. Remember how she forced us to play that kissing game? A kiss is fine when there's consent. - Isn't it? - They were unchaperoned. Remember when Lavender Lewis was caught doing some matrimonial sampling with Stephen Mills? No one would marry her after that. She had to move to Winnipeg. Josie's reputation is ruined. Why isn't Billy's? He was heedless and disrespectful! Josie has every right to be upset! - So I suppose we should get to work. - Is it more important to talk about who had the biggest cabbage than to discuss issues which concern an entire gender? What's your hurry? Need to catch a train to Charlottetown? You don't need a crystal ball to see that Josie Pye has been wronged! Do you want to write about the balloon... or...? I'll... write about the fancyworks. The only thing more boring than needlepoint is reading about... Ah!
