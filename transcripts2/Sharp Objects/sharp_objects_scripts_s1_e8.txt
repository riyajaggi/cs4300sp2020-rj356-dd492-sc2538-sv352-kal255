 Goddamn Martha Stewart funeral. What if, after you die, part of you goes to heaven, but part of you stays here? Goddamn Mother of the Year. Just to see how things turn out... And then she burned her. - For you... For Mama. - Cremated. Hello, darling. Sit down. Have dinner with us. Special occasion. I set a place for you. "Occasion" means cake, Mama. You promised.

 Now that the Keene boy's been arrested, our little girl is finally safe. I can't even say the relief I feel. - Yep. All is well at last. - Mmm-hmm. Is it? I don't think John Keene is a killer. Of course you don't. Camille, sit down. Sit down. I suppose this means you'll be heading back to St. Louis shortly. Story's over. I hope he gets the death penalty. Babykiller Keene. Turns out, Missouri is the fifth most productive state

 in terms of carrying out executions. We had to stop. It was, uh... The fluid was controversial. I think, um... Yeah, I think it wasn't killing people well enough. Well, in any case, um... I just read that we import it from Romania. - Fluid? - For lethal injection, sweetie. - Oh. - Hmm. Needles. Like the needles I get sometimes? Very different. Like putting a cat to sleep. Hmm. Well, I hope he gets the needle. Guess which Greek goddess I am, Camille. I guess I'm not really up on my goddesses. I'm Persephone. Queen of the Underworld. She's married to that... Big dude. Hades. He runs Hell, but she's in charge of punishment. But I feel sorry for Persephone because, even when she's back with the living, they're afraid of her because of where she's been. Kind of funny, huh? How many stories they have where princesses need to get rescued from witches. Wind Gap has one, even. Little girls yanked from the woods by the Woman in White. I don't like that one. - Too close to home? - Mmm-hmm. Would you be more sad if John died or I died? I don't want anybody to die. Wind Gap has too much death as it is. Hear, hear. Camille, uh, that food's not gonna eat itself. Or aren't you feeling well? Just a little off. Your editor must be excited about getting his intrepid girl reporter back. What will you work on next? Maybe something more upbeat for a change. In any case, I'm sure he's happy to have you back where you belong. Well, Mama... I was thinking that with everything going on in town, all the trouble, it might be nice to have Amma come stay with me in St. Louis for a while. Little change of pace might do her good. Well... That is a truly remarkable suggestion. That's a wonderful offer, dear. But impossible. She's starting school soon. I think it would be nice to see that big old arch. Did you two discuss this already? No. I just thought that... Amma. Your color is high. Are you feverish? Oh, God. You're as hot as an oven. - I want cake. - No, you have to lie down. - I want cake. - I will bring you cake later. Please eat, Camille. We'll say our goodbyes in the morning. - I want cake. - Come on, sweet. Come on, sweet. Come on. You can have cake. Dinner is not finished, Camille. Ma. - Mama! - Adora! - Mama. Oh, God. - Help me. - What's going on, sweetheart? - I don't know. - Okay, come on. - Help her up. - Mama's here. Hold on. - What's going on? I don't know. I don't know what happened. It's all right. It's okay. It's all right, dear. - I got you. - Okay. You may come in, darling. Take your clothes off. Do you see how nice it is not to have to worry or fight? Just to let yourself be looked after? Mmm. Yeah. This will be good for both of us. Don't you think? Mmm, yes. Open, darling. Ahh... Mmm. You are such a good girl. More, Mama. Yes. Now rest. I'll fix your dosage for the night. - How'd you sleep, son? - Why am I even here, hmm? Well, the thing is, John, your girl, Ashley, she gave you up. So, she... She said I did it, or she thinks I did it? She led us to evidence. What do you think that was? I got no idea. She wasn't getting what she wanted from me. Sometimes you stay with somebody, and the only reason is because you don't have the energy to go through ending it. All the fights and the scenes. And with Ashley, it was gonna be a scene. And then Natalie happened, and... I don't know, I could barely, uh... Ashley was there, but I wasn't, really. You know? Natalie "happened." Yeah. Yeah, somebody killed my little sister. Not me. Do you want me to say it again? Want me to fucking write it down? So, you think Ashley made something up to get back at you. - Is that what you're saying? - I don't know. But she was mad at me, and she had her reasons to be, I guess. How do you explain the blood we found in the carriage house? What? Natalie's blood. How do you explain it, John? Really? It happened there? Come on, John. Stop bullshitting us. - You know it fucking happened... - I don't know! Okay? It doesn't make any fucking sense! Look, I know I need to get my head right because what happened to Natalie and Ann. But you want me to say it's me. And you could probably get away with it. But you'd be so wrong. You'd be so fucking wrong. What do you think? He gonna crack? Almost everyone does if you push them hard enough. Even if they're innocent. Well, we'll give him some time to think about it. Take another run at him after his next shitty meal. Sorry about the Preaker girl. No need to be sorry. She got a lot of her mother in her. Adora's not as dramatic about it, but that woman loves her attention. Then scolds you if you give her too much. Well, if you listen to all the talk around here, everyone's some kind of crazy or evil. Only half of it's true. That's what I'm worried about. We're looking at the wrong half. News crew's coming down from St. Louis today. Jocelyn says the stubble... How'd she put it? "Undermines my authority." I think she just wants to spare her chin. Oh, Alan. Uh, sorry, this won't take long. The chief here is fixing to be on the news. Oh. I guess, uh, congratulations are in order. I suppose they are. Well, I'll just, uh, come back in a while. - How's Amma? - Amma's fine, fine. - I ran into her roller pals. - Oh, yeah? Said she wasn't feeling well. Sick. Yeah. We've been passing something around the house. I hope you don't catch it. How's that? You're up there as much as I am. Why don't you pull up a chair, Alan? We'll talk this out like men. Get it out. Mama? Well, you're back early. Clyde was, uh... Wasn't feeling very well. Neither is Camille. She's already finished a bottle, poor thing. Don't go overboard. What? I only mean... Let the girls rest. The body's a miraculous thing. Let's just let it do its work. I will. I'm just helping nature along. This is your area. Is there anything you want here? Whatever. You took it, didn't you? It's better if you don't try to stand. Crawling's okay. - How do you feel? - Can you walk? Yeah, I'm not so bad right now. She's got you to care for. I need you to call, um... No cell. Mama took it. Then I need you to go get Richard. - Um, what? - Go and get him, and tell him that I need him, that we need help. - And if anything... - Mama. ...happens to me, you tell them - that Mama took care of me. - Mama. You understand? So you go. And you don't come back. Go. What's going on? You girls better be in bed. Camille. Camille. - Oh, darling. - Mama... - Camille. - Mama, am I gonna die? We're all gonna die, Camille. Let's get you clean. You're just covered in sick. I got you. Hold on. Feeling better, dear? Here. Here. Oh, it's not so bad. - On the mend, I hope. - Yeah. Hey, how about that cake, hmm? I could use a piece myself. If we're gonna have cake, we should tell Mama. You go on upstairs to your room, and I'll bring you your dessert. Mmm-hmm. This is not the time to insert yourself, you understand? All right. Sit right here. Right there, right there... Check this, one, two. One, two, three. One, two. Okay, you ready? Here we go. You know I'm gonna be here all night. - Well, so am I. Mmm. - Yeah. All right. All right. I have other people to take care of. You know how to sing, Big City? Mama, what's in the blue bottle? Oh. I've waited for this for so long, for you to need me. Of my three girls, you're the one most like me. Marian, she was a... She was a good girl. She just... She needed constant attention. Stuck to my side. You killed her. She was a very sick little girl. You're delirious. - She died. - You burned her. Well, ashes to ashes, I say. To even think of you or her rotting in a box, things eating away at you? No, no, no. No, no. Just tell me. What? - Tell me. - You're asking me to lie. I can't. I can't do that, even for you. My mother, you never did know her like I did. Once, Joya woke me in the dead of night. I was seven, eight. She didn't say a word to me. Just shook me awake, walked me outside. Barefoot, in my nightgown. I knew better than to open my mouth when Joya was punishing me. It was the same whether I'd done something wrong or not. She drove me to the woods, walked me in deep, sat me down and left me. Took me hours to get home. When I finally made it, I walked in that door, and my mother said, "You're home." I believe if you had asked her she would have said what she was doing was right. We all have bad childhoods. At some point, you have to forget it, move on. Anything else is just selfish. Time for more medicine. I don't want any more. I can't. It's good for you. Here. Take just a little more. Right here. I'll be right back. It's okay. Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello... - Evening, Detective. - Good evening. I didn't hear you right off. I apologize. Is Camille available? Not at the moment, no. She's out with those girlfriends of hers. Help me. - Tell her I stopped by? - I certainly will. You have a good evening, Detective. Amma, you said you were gonna go. I'm sorry. I need to stay her good girl. I need to stay her good girl. Preaker. Leave a message. Preaker. Leave a... Mama. Alan! Alan! Alan! Alan! Camille. Camille. Camille. Talk to me. Camille. Camille, look at me. Look at me. We need an ambulance in here now! Get one up here now! - Camille! - Get Amma. Get Amma. Shh. It's okay, honey. Amma. It's gonna be okay, kiddo. It's all right. Get you home. Home. Home. Home. Yeah. Home. You're okay. - Amma! - You're okay now. What were you told to warrant this kind of a violation? You know me. You know who I am. My God! You know how sorry I am it has to be this way, but we have reason to believe... No. Get... Alan, get Glen Morgan on the phone. - Yeah, all right. - He's our lawyer. I won't have this. I don't... I don't care what Camille told you. - She is mentally ill. - Detective? Do you understand? What do you got? - Do you understand? - Adora, that's not the point. She's mentally ill. Mrs. Crellin, you're gonna need to come down to the station with me. What? Adora, put your hands behind your back. Adora, you have to do what he says. Now. No, no, no. No, I can't. I can't. They're trying to make this as respectful as possible. - Put your hands behind your back. - No, no, no, no. You have the right to remain silent. Detective, is that necessary? You have the right to an attorney. If you can't afford an... Call me as soon as you get there. Do you understand your rights, Mrs. Crellin? - Come up. Please, gentlemen, hurry. - Yes, sir. Can you see that? Can you see it? Mmm-hmm. - Eyes are PEARL. - Can you see it? - She gonna be okay? Yeah. Eyes are PEARL, too. - Good girl. - Yeah. - Can you walk? Come on. - Yeah. - Good, good, good. Okay. - I'm walking out of here. Take it easy. Take it easy, now. - It's gonna be all right. - Please don't. - Check 'em. - I got you. - Amma! - Mama! Mama! - Amma! - Mama! Mama! I'm bleeding as fast as I can. We found the pliers that match the marks on Ann and Natalie's gums, so we're expecting to charge your mom on the girls, too. She pulled the teeth alone? She might have had an accomplice, maybe Alan. We'll investigate. And what about Marian? We're hopeful that the levels from you two will help us. Thank you. Usually Munchausen Moms, they, uh... They tend to use the same poisons once they find one they like. We found a collection of medicine Adora was hoarding. Antifreeze, prescriptions. Rat poison. Amma built up a tolerance for it over the years. That's what the doctors think. But, uh, not you, so... Oh, Christ. You have a good friend in your boss. Vickery didn't want to hear it from me, but, uh, Curry nearly busted the station door down. I'm sorry for your... I'm sorry, Camille. For everything. Yeah. Me, too. I'm sorry. What a dick. How do you plead? Not guilty. Well, look here. I wasn't expecting to see you beauties. Don't you just look beautiful? Did you get the housewarming card I sent you? Okay. I know your place isn't new to Camille, but it is new to you. It's a new lease. You know, I might just come up to St. Louis one day for a visit. Yeah, you should do that. Do not let that witch come to St. Louis. She tries. She's just not happy. Not happy? She's a pig in shit now that Mama's out of the way. "Men get to be warrior poets. "What woman is described that way? Not Adora. "Prosecution says my mother is a warrior martyr. "If she was guilty, they argued, "it was only of a very female sort of rage. "Overcare. Killing through kindness. "It shouldn't have surprised me "that Adora fell on that sword spectacularly. "Of course, she never did explain the teeth "or that kind of naked rage a person, "man or woman, would need to do something like that. "It didn't fit. "So, as with everything in my mother's world, it didn't exist, "except perhaps in some dark place only she knows about. "My mother has many years to consider what she's done. "As for me, "I've forgiven myself for failing to save my sister "and given myself over to raising the other. "Am I good at caring for Amma because of kindness, "or do I like caring for Amma because I have Adora's sickness? "I waver between the two. "Especially at night, when my skin begins to pulse. "Lately, I've been... "Leaning toward kindness." Come on, what do you think? Can't a person be quiet for a second, or... It's beautiful, Cubby. Really beautiful. So, just file it? File it. Um... You noticed I finally stopped asking if you were fine? You noticed I started asking if you were? Yeah. It's annoying. - Are you? - Doing better. Stop it. I owe you. You and Eileen, I do. If you, uh... If you ever need anything... You certainly do not owe us. Worrying about you was the only thing that kept the missus from nursing me to death. She seems like she's gonna be just fine. And I like her friend. She might actually be a good influence on her. Amma's, uh... I don't know. She doesn't sleep most nights unless I'm with her. - She misses Adora. - What a thing. Even when you win the fucked-up family Olympics... Okay, guys, time to eat now. Oh. It's about damn time! So, it turns out that the mayor didn't want me to know because the new head of Parks and Rec was his appointment and his mistress. And that, I believe, has nothing to do with, Mae, your question about why the public pool closed. Oh, but it was a good story. Juicy. My husband will take the long route to avoid a simple "I don't know." I like your editorials, Mr. Curry. They make good points, and they're not boring. - You read the editorials? - Mmm-hmm. Call me Frank. I like this girl. I'm thinking about going into either politics or journalism. - Mmm. - You just say that to impress Camille. - I do not. - Kiss-ass. I don't know what I want to do yet, exactly. - We have a lot of time, right? - Absolutely. Well, I'm gonna be an on-camera personality. I have the gift of gab, that's what... That's what people say. Well, that's interesting. How does one get into that field? Well, you start with the gift of gab. Then you go to college, and Communications major. Again, he has no idea. I have no idea. Let's just get you through high school first, hmm? Do you wish I was a writer like you? All I wish is for you to be happy. You make me happy. I could eat you up. Okay. All right, good night. G'night. Sorry to bother you, but have you seen Mae? Oh, uh, I think that she and Amma went to the park to not swim in the closed pool, but, uh, they should be back soon. Did Amma talk to you? I think the girls had their first little fight. - Over what? - Who knows? A boy, nail polish, - girl stuff. - Yeah. I envy the skin, but nothing else about that age, you know? Yeah. Well, um, when they get back, I'll send her your way, all right? - Thanks, hon. - All right, no problem. Bye. Don't tell Mama.
