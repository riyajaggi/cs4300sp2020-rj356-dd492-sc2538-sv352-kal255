 Amma! Bless you for finding her. I never loved you. Good morning. Good morning. You want a cup of coffee? I got French vanilla in a vacuum-sealed pouch. No, thank you. I should probably get going. I got a busy day. What about tonight?

 Well, I have plans. Unless you feel like joining a bunch of ex-high school cheerleaders. You could see what I might've been like if I'd have stayed in Wind Gap. You slept in your clothes? If you want, I'm the proud owner of a 14-year-old flannel. Sounds like you're halfway to a question you wanted to ask me. No, it was an offer. You're gonna have to do better than a cup of coffee and an old flannel shirt. - Be safe out there today. - Chief... What is it? Don't do a thing till I get there. Have you seen Alan?

 No. Why, do you need a ride? No. Thank you, I'm just... A quick trip to the pharmacy. I don't mind. I gotta pick up some cream anyway. - For your scars? - For my hands. I can pick that up for you. Finish your breakfast. This is the first time I've seen you eat since you got here. What? You tell me. Alan? - What do you think? - Millie, you're beautiful. Mama, couldn't you just take a bite out of her? Like a plump, juicy cherry. Thank you. - Where you going? - Just to hang out. Well, not that I'm the best to give advice on getting loaded, but after yesterday, you should slow down. I'll be fine. It's just a few scratches. You should really put something on those cuts. Look. Check this. If I connect these two, I could make a "C" for "Camille." That's not funny. I wasn't serious. Okay, well, just don't ever do anything - like that, all right? - Yes. I won't. Okay. Thank you, for coming for me last night. I get funny ideas sometimes. Paying your respects? That's good of you. It offsets the bad I do. It's a losing battle, but it helps me sleep. I think a young girl prefers daisies. Adora's always roses, roses, roses. But these look like what a child draws. - It's sweet. - Yeah. Can I ask you something? Adora mentioned that Camille had some sort of episode recently. Well, that's interesting. I'm not one to talk about people's touchy areas. Not when I'm sober, anyway. You're getting warmer, Detective. And not just 'cause it's hotter than a whore in church today. - KCPD. - Hey, it's Willis. I need to run a 522. Admittance records, area hospitals. Okay, what's the name? Camille Preaker. I gotta call you back. Chief. I'm on my way. Thank you. Who found it? My workers. Bob, I'm so sorry they dragged you down here. - I'm sorry. - Is it Ann's? Might be. I don't know. Let's hose it down. No, we still might be able to pull a print off it. Bob, you think you could identify it by the seat? It was white, with flowers on it. Here you go. I'm sorry, Bob. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. We're gonna need the employment records of everyone who's worked here for the last five years. Why don't you come rub me down? Where's Ashley? Cheerleading practice. What time does she get home? Why? 'Cause there's you, me and an empty carriage house. Who do I remind you of? A bad little girl who thinks she's a lot cuter than she is. Then you should stop watching me. You know how Ashley gets when she's jealous. I like to keep on you, Amma. Just know I always got an eye on you. You sure do, now. It'll be your day. Soon. Hi. - Is everything okay? - Not really. My mama says you take your problems with you wherever you go. Sounds about right. There are places you can go for help. You know that, right? Maybe the voices in your head can talk to somebody. We don't want more little girls showing up without their teeth. Amma. I am so rude. - Have you been waiting long? - No. Oh, good. Good. Hi, girls! Jodes, Mama wants you to call her. Would you go get us some lemonade, please? John. Come in. I'm so sorry about the mess. You could've been a model, you know? - I highly doubt that. - No, you could have. I always wanted to be like you when I was growing up. You're a legend around here. There are far better women to aspire to. Not in Wind Gap, there aren't. I used to think about you. I pictured you in a big mansion with a few curly tops and a big investment banker husband. That sounds nice. So, what can you tell me about the girls? Straight to business, huh? Yeah. Okay. They were darling little girls. Very well-behaved. Sweet little things. It's like God plucked the very best girls from Wind Gap to take to heaven for his own. Hey, why'd you do that? Because you were just wasting my time. No, I... Okay. I was just trying to protect John. He's already been hurt enough. Why does he need your protection? Do you think he did it? No. Of course not. He would never do something like that. What makes you say that? Because it would make him popular. Thank you, John. Do you ever miss cheerleading? Shit. - Cramps. - That time of the month? My calf, bitch. Thank you. When you're done with her, I'll go next. Oh, fuck off, Katie. I'm good, Becca. Thank you. Whoa. You sure it wasn't the other cramps? Hi. How about homemade sauce with pasta and red wine? I mean, it's progress. You just tell me when. So, homemade. Does that mean you're gonna cook? You bet I will, in my fancy kitchen. I mean, that is if you don't mind having dinner in bed. Well, that's very convenient of you. Guess what we found today. Thanks to your mom. Even the lawn is not safe from her. Shall I ask her to move it? Why cause a scene? I left your hand cream in the bathroom. - Oh, you got it. - Of course, I did. Was that before or after they found Ann Nash's bike down at the factory? Well, that was a business matter. It did not concern you. The first piece of material evidence in a double homicide certainly does concern me. Now you know about it, so there's no reason to be upset with me. Camille, your mother would like you to move your car... Was the first call they made to the police or you? I heard that Bob Nash was there. What was his reaction when he saw the bike? Are you interviewing me? Yeah. Yeah, I guess I am. I'm your mother. I'm not a source. I'm sure you found other ways to get your information. - Thanks for the hand cream. - You're welcome. I believe she's outstayed her welcome. You've been more than tolerant, dear. Thank you. Let her know how you feel about it, please. Hi. I have an appointment with Dr. Hafia. - What's your name? - Richard Willis. Willis? I'm trying to get a handle on the personality type that might come in here. It might help me get somewhere on this case I'm investigating. There isn't any one type that we see here. Some of them are suffering from underlying psychological problems such as depression, psychosis, bipolar disorder. And then a lot of our patients are just trying to distract from painful feelings resulting from trauma or stress. That's a pretty wide net. Like I said, nothing typical. But if a person was to end up in a place like this, their behavior would have to be pretty severe? Well, people come in here in a crisis. Our patients can be impulsive and aggressive, but they are very rarely violent. Whatever is going on with them, they take it out on themselves more than other people. Do you ever miss cheerleading? So, is that why you think that the killer is doing this, for popularity? What other reason is there? - Hi. - Cubby! What's the story? Well, potential break. They pulled the bicycle of the first victim out of a lagoon of pig shit. Holy fuck! Were you there? No. My mother was. What does the book of journalism say about using a family member as a source? They're called "anonymous sources." Right. Why would someone hide the bicycle in a shallow pool of pig shit, unless they were stupid or trying to frame someone? So you think it's someone from town. Maybe. Everybody thinks that a man is behind this and no one's looking at the women. No, 'cause it doesn't fit the profile. Women don't kill like that, that violent. Until they do. Get it yourself. Why aren't you in the office? 'Cause the old ball and chain won't let me. She's got me tied to the bed. That's what an animal I am in the sack. Hey, honey. How are you? I'm worried about you. I'm fine, I'm just looking forward to coming home. Which is a weird thing to say when you're sitting in the bedroom you grew up in. It's closing in on you, huh? Well, that's a nice way to put it. Well, sometimes the Lord offers you the very thing you need. Yeah. I'm moving the car now. Oh, Camille, that can... You know, that can wait. Please, come have a seat. We haven't talked in a while. Listen, you're making your mother ill. And I'm gonna have to ask you to leave if these conditions don't improve. I don't understand. How am I making her ill? You cannot day after day churn out the grisly details of dead children to the mother of a dead child! Alan, I have done nothing of the sort with Adora. Oh, please, Camille. I know how jealous you've always been of anyone else's well-being. And to think that I used to regret that we didn't communicate. That is something Joya would say. Yeah, you really are like your grandmother. She would stand guard over this house like a witch. The only time she ever smiled was when you refused to nurse from Adora. Well, it has been really nice, Alan. Thank you. Camille, Adora has had a hard life. Joya would come into her room in the middle of the night, and she would pinch her. She said that she was worried that Adora would die in her sleep. You know what I say? She just liked to hurt people. Yeah, I think you've made your point. I just think that if you knew these things, it might make you somewhat kinder to your mother. Yeah, I'll be leaving as soon as I can, all right? That would be a good idea. What was that all about? You know, family. Oh, look at you. When you ride with me, you ride in style. Smooth. That's good bourbon, but the key is in the ice. Large ice trays, distilled water, these cubes will change your life. Not that I'd know 'cause I'm carrying. That husband of yours has gotta be missing you something awful. Nope, no husband. Well, honey, you just string that boyfriend of yours on as long as you can, and he'll be begging to marry you. Yeah, no boyfriend either. You didn't hear this from me, but Lisa is thinking about getting separated. Son of a bitch. Let's go, asshole. She walked in on her husband jerking off on a copy of a credit card bill. Don't ask me what that's all about. Gretchen was the one that told me. Don't believe her "I'm so sweet" act for a second here. She's already repeating every word you say to any bitch who will listen before you can even get it out your mouth. Katie, too. But I don't need to tell you that. We've known that bitch our whole life. Here you go, baby. Oh, God. There's Lisa's husband's car. Overcompensating for you know what, if you ask me. And just think of the house you would've had if you had stuck around. Finish that up. For an expensive house, she pours cheap liquor. I'm so glad you're here. This is gonna be like the old days. We gonna have us some fun. I waited for you. I'm here now. I wanna go. I don't want them to see me here. Are you sure? Are you really sure? - Hey. - Get a Jim Beam, please. What's this I hear about you and Ms. Preaker? This town. Don't you people have anything better to do? No. Don't believe everything you hear. Yeah, well, you might want to take your own advice on that one. Just saying. This isn't about the movie, is it, darling? No. Oh, it's okay, honey. You can talk to us. You're amongst friends. I went back to work. Good God, sweetie, why? With Stephie in preschool, I felt like I wanted to, like I needed a purpose. You have a purpose. Don't let feminism tell you what to do with your family. She's right. Feminism means letting women make the choices they want. Dear heart, what is it? What is it? Jack doesn't want to have any more kids. - He says four's enough. - For him or for you? I don't know. This shit happens every week. You deserve it. If you want five, you want five. You're the only one who has said that to me. Well, he's not gonna say it. He's such an asshole. I had no idea my life was so miserable until I started coming to Katie's little get-togethers. Well, being conflicted means you can live a shallow life without copping to being a shallow person. Hm. Sounds about right. I guess we are who we were in high school. I set the bar low for myself then, so there's no way to go but up. Well, I'm glad you two are having so much fun. Considering what's going on in this town. What's wrong with this world? Why would somebody hurt little girls? - Oh, poor things. - There she goes again. Jesus. And to take their teeth? Just plain sick is what it is. How can you even report on these things, Camille? Hey, that's not fair. Camille doesn't have any children, and I just don't think you can feel the pain the way that we do. Right. I feel, for those little girls. It's terrible. I don't mean to sound cruel, but I don't think part of your heart can ever work if you don't have kids. I didn't really become a woman until I felt McKenzie inside of me. I mean, there's all this talk of God versus science, but it seems like with babies, both sides agree. The Bible says, "be fruitful and multiply," and then science... I mean, when it boils down to it, that's just what women were made for. Girl power. - Hi. - Hey. Didn't expect to see you here. I thought this was kind of like a "girls only" thing. Yeah, well, Katie doesn't know I'm here. Well, I will not tell her. - Thanks. - Okay. Hey, I'm glad... Oh, let's... Listen, I'm glad we can have a minute. I just, I felt I owe you an apology for what happened. What happened? Well, that day. In the woods. And what we did to you. I have daughters now, and it makes me sick thinking that... That a bunch of football players would pull a train on them at the end of a big game? Camille... As I recall, you couldn't even get it up, so unless you're apologizing for that... - Hey. - Oh, come on. Just forget about it, all right? I have. That day, it's haunted me. Well, looks like we both got fucked. Perky little titties, shining in the sun. - This gun loaded? - It is. Look at you. I have had my hand on your thigh for the past 15 minutes, Detective. This isn't turning out like I was hoping, so why don't you just get to what you need to get to, all right? Camille. Mm. Why was she in rehab? Mm. I know she was hurting herself. What I'm asking is why? Mm. Well, I don't know. I'm pretty fond of Camille. You know? She's sensitive. Special. Beautiful girl. She wasn't the same after her sister died. How did she die? Marian was sickly, a sickly child. Was there an autopsy? Adora Crellin was not gonna let them carve up her little girl. "Carve up." That's an interesting choice of words. You seem to know a lot more than you're letting on, so why don't you just tell me what you know? I know she checked herself out early after her roommate killed herself. Jesus. Well, that's news to me. Dead girls everywhere. How'd she die? She drank poison. Are you sure I can't drive you home? Yeah, no, I'm good. I'll just walk. All right. Why are you being nice to me? Why wouldn't I be? We were bitches to you in high school. Bitches. - You were better than most. - Well, that's not saying much. You were going through a lot. Lost your sister, and you took it out on yourself. Remember when I was rubbing your leg and you were bleeding? Everyone thought you had your period, but I saw. On your thigh, the cuts. It said "cherry." That made sense. We were so shiny. Luscious on the outside. But on the inside, there's that dark, hard pit. Yeah. Can I quote you on that? - Alan? - Hm? I see you didn't take care of what I asked you to do. Oh, well, you were always better at handling the girls, dear. I can't... I can't believe she's here. Come on! - What if she gets mad? - She's gonna be fine. She's gonna be fine. - Hi! - Hi! What is that? - That's mine. - What you got there? - None of your business. - Look who's here, boys! - I see that. - That's my big sis, Camille. - Hey, Camille! - That's Nathan. This is Damon. - We're gonna take you home. - No. - Come on. - Yeah. - We're gonna take you home. - Get on in. - Amma, I'm gonna walk. - Go on, get in. - Come on. - No way. - The seat's warm. - We'll drop you off before we go. - We'll drop you off before we go. - Oh, sweet! We're dropping her off before we go. Gotcha. You're like my ma's age, but hot. Yeah, I doubt that. How old is your ma? Like 33, 34. - And what's her name? - Casey Rayburn. - Must be before my time. - Dude, seriously? This chick is obviously way too cool to be hanging out with your crackwhore mama. - Fuck you, Damon! - Hey. Hey. Well, I think that was a very nice compliment. Thank you very much. That was very sweet of you. What the fuck's taking so long? Let's go! Par-tay, par-tay. Come on! Whoo! Let's get outta here! You sure you don't want to come with us? It'll be fun. Come on, chiquita. OxyContin. Makes you feel really good. I'm sure it does, but doing it with my kid sister won't, so... Come on, Mille, just one? I feel so happy and good right now. You just... I mean, you just have to. Come on, do it. Do it! Do it! Do it! - Come on! - Yeah, okay! Just five minutes. Then we'll take you home. I promise. Come on, Camille! Please. Yeah. Yeah! Damon, let's go! Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God. They came! They totally came! - Do we say hello? - Just let J.C. handle it. Hi! Justine, how are you? Good to see you. Hi! I thought you guys said you weren't coming. Oh, I thought that was stupid. Anyone with a brain knows that John's cool. And plus, we're not gonna be fucking outcasts. Excuse me. What the fuck are y'all doing here? I can't believe you're here. That he showed his face. God, you're such a little bitch. You don't know anything, you druggy fucker. Hey. Hey, come on. Hey. Hey. Come on, girls. It's okay. Just don't talk. Okay, that's enough. All right? - Bye, murderer! - Amma. Why don't you go drink a little bit more? Fuck off. It's like she goes out of her way to irritate me. I don't think you're alone in that regard. So, how's my article coming along? To be honest, you didn't really say anything particularly quote-worthy. But I already told people that I'm gonna be in it. Yeah, well, I'm on to different stories. - Okay. - Like the one about how someone took a chunk out of your ear. - Was it Natalie? - Who told you about that? With you withholding information like that, that's not gonna help you. It's just not something I like to remember. Let's go. J.C. doesn't want me here. If you want to know about Natalie, you should ask your mom. Besides, who really cares about your stupid article, anyway? Nobody reads the newspaper anymore. See you later, baby killer. Fuck y'all! Fuck all y'all! Get this show on the road, huh? Come on. VIP room! Yes! Yes! Yes! Don't push me, Kelsey. Sorry. Have you ever played a game of Rolling Roulette? No. We pass the X around... - Okay, here. - Here. - Jodes. - Thank you! ...and the tongue it dissolves on last is the lucky winner. This is Damon's best shit, though, so we'll all roll a little. Hey. Hey, wait a minute. Amma! Hey! Drink lots of water. Oh, fuck, Amma, the game barely started. Camille's my guest and my sister. Plus, she could use a little sunshine. She's had a pretty shitty life. And just so you know, we have a dead sister, just like John Keene, and she's never, ever dealt with it. Anyway... Why are you doing this? You are a Union woman! Whoo! I'm coming with you. I wanna come with you. Fuck off. All right? Come on. These are really beautiful. I love yellow when I'm stoned. Mama says I need to be careful around you. Are you dangerous? Let's get out of here. Let's get out of here. Let's get out of here. Let's get out of here. - Kansas City. - Chief. Breakfast for dinner. - Thank you, Jessie. - My pleasure. I gotta say, I really miss seeing you in that Robert E. Lee getup. First off, I was Stonewall Jackson. I'd rather die under friendly fire than surrender like a coward. The more I know about you, the less I want to know. That's Wind Gap for you. But you're gonna be going home tomorrow. Oh, yeah? Why is that? Mexican worker at the hog farm ID'd Keene as the guy who dumped the bike in the lagoon. No shit. Good shit. Can't wait to get out of here. I'm bored all the time. That's why I act the way I do. I know I can be a little off. Did girls like you growing up? I mean, boys are easy. You just let them do stuff to you. You shouldn't let them do that. When you let them do it to you, you're really doing it to them. You have the control and they like you. It's not the same with girls. I mean, I can get them to do what I want, but they don't like me. "It's safer to be feared than loved." Machiavelli. How do you know that? You know how. Sometimes you need to be mean or hurt. Amma, do you cut? - I'm so happy with you! - Shh! You're like my soul mate. You're like my sister. I love you. Take me back to St. Louis with you. I can get a job after school at a boutique or a fancy fabric shop. You think I could put my dollhouse on a résumé? I thought you liked it rough. - Want to sleep in my room? - No. No, I'm dead tired. I think I should just go to my bed tonight. Can I sleep over with you? No, I... I think we should just sleep separate tonight, and then we'll hang out tomorrow, okay? Amma. Amma! Fine! Fine! Fine. You can sleep in my room. Come on. You can sleep with me. Oh, Jesus, Amma. I just can't remember being this happy. I wanna bring my dollhouse upstairs. I know you think Adora likes me better, but that's not true. She calls out names when she's sleeping. Marian, you. - Here. - Wait. Wait. Do you ever feel like bad things are gonna happen to you and you can't stop them? You can't do anything? You just have to wait? It's not safe here for you.
