Also, Pan stops a bank robbery.

 [MAI] I don't know what's going on, but it's madness in there, sire! I'm telling you, this isn't a good time. [PILAF] You clueless idiot! There will never be a better time. It's the perfect diversion. [blasts] [DENDE] I know the Lookout is designed for stuff like this, but the cracking floor is starting to make me nervous. [SHU] If they're gonna blow us up, I'd rather go back to the base. [PILAF] No, you won't!

 You'll proceed ahead with your orders as ordered ! [PILAF] Now both of you, pull! Get us over that edge! [struggling] [MR. POPO] The floor does seem to look a little unstable. [DENDE] Maybe we should get out of here! [PILAF] Finally, I did it! Now, everyone, to the Dragon Balls! [explosion] [PILAF] Am I bleeding? [MAI] I think you'll be fine. [SHU] I can't see you, sire. [PILAF] Well, something hurts pretty bad. Thanks to decades of gut-wrenching perseverance and research, this is the last pain I'll feel

 in searching for the Dragon Balls. [PILAF] By day's end, my reckoning will be at hand and all of humanity will know the name Emperor Pilaf. It'll be synonymous with fear and rage... ...and with power and strength! The world will know me as King... King Emperor Pilaf! [GOKU] We're finished, Dende. Well... Don't keep us in suspense. How'd Uub do? He passed with flying colors. I was really impressed. I have to admit, though, I haven't had a battle that wore me out this much since Frieza. How does it feel to graduate, Uub? Really good. Uub, are you okay? [crash] Popo, get the first aid kit! [maniacal laughter] [PILAF] I've found them! At long last, I found them! They don't look like any Dragon Balls I've ever seen. Oh, they don't, huh? Well, feast your eyes on this! The star is black? [PILAF] That's right. These are the Black Star Dragon Balls. They were made long ago before Kami separated from Piccolo. And I know this because I am a brilliant researcher and an unrivaled mastermind... with a special knack for devious behavior. [coughing] Awesome... aren't they? Aren't they?! Uh... what now? You idiot!! [crash]  Oh, sire! Emperor Pilaf! You boneheads... What's awesome is that these balls are twice as strong as the other ones because they were made when Kami and Piccolo were still one. Just like I told you not ten seconds ago. [MAI] So, if these are stronger, do they grant more than one wish? Or do they give you more with each wish, like a bonus? 'Cause if all you get's a stronger wish, then I'd-- Give it! The wish is mine to make. [PILAF] I order you to pick the other Dragon Balls out of those skeletons immediately! [MAI] Yes, Emperor. [GOKU] I hope you're as proud of yourself as we are, Uub. You certainly have earned it. Thanks for everything you guys, I just hate to leave the Lookout like this. [DENDE] Don't worry about it, Uub. It's been a lot worse. Mr. Popo and I can fix it right up... Really... Besides... You need to get back to your family. I'm sure they miss you. [UUB] Thanks, Dende. Well, Goku, I can't tell you how much I appreciate everything. [UUB] You've changed my life. [GOKU] Hey, don't thank me. I got just as much out of it as you did. Really? Yeah... you're a great teacher. [UUB] That's funny, Goku. I'll see you fellas later. Take care! All we have ever worked for has culminated in this moment. Such a happy day. I don't know what the word culminate means, but I do know that I'm glad you guys brought me along. [sobbing] [MAI] Excuse me, guys... But I've noticed that every time we're on the brink of success, something inevitably happens to keep us away from it. So what do you say we hurry up with this! Yeah, right... Of course. Ahh... That's what I call a meal! [GOKU] When's the second course gonna be ready? Second... course? And now... Rise! Rise, Shenron!! [hysterical panting] Well, I better get going. [GOKU] I haven't been home in a few years and I'm betting my wife won't be too happy with me. [hysterical panting] [SHENRON] Why have you summoned me? [GOKU] Hey, what's going on in there? [terrified gasps] Who's there? [screams] It's him! Hey, I know you guys, don't I? [GOKU] I can't place it, but you look familiar. Do... you know me? [nervous groans] [GOKU] What's wrong? Cat got your tongue? Hey, Shu? Who is that? It's that little kid Goku all grown up. You mean the Goku?! You're saying that guy is the little brat who always put himself between me and my greatness?! Only now, he's grown up. And he's got a body that looks like it was chiseled out of marble. Yeah, I remember you now. You're Emperor Pilaf, right? Uh, you must have me confused with somebody else. [attempts casual whistle] No, you're Emperor Pilaf all right... I'd have a hard time forgetting blue skin and pointy ears. Shu! Mai! Annihilate him! All these years, and the three of you are still up to no good. [frustrated groan] [PILAF] Oh, yeah?! Well, you've grown from a little nuisance into an even bigger one! Well, you're the bad guys. I'm supposed to stop your evil plans. Get away from me! You're three times my size! I wish you were a little kid again, then I could really teach you a lesson or two! [SHENRON] So be it. [confused groan] [panting] What? Goku! Wow, the room got a lot bigger somehow. Goku? [SHENRON] Your wish has been granted. [SHENRON] Until the next summoning... Wait... Don't go, dragon... Please. So...uh... Do I have to go back to school now? Oh, no!! A wish was made on the Black Star Dragon Balls! [DENDE] That's what I'm saying! [KING KAI] It's amazing to me that they have survived this long up there. They must have been put in that mausoleum a really long time ago because none of us ever knew they were there. Goku, listen! As horrible as this news is, I hope you'll take it lightly as long as it comes from a friend. The only way you  can return to normal is if you gather the Black Star Dragon Balls and make another wish! No biggie, King Kai. I'll find the Dragon Balls. Besides, being a kid again for a while might be kind of fun. It's not that simple. [MR. POPO] After a wish is made on the Black Star Dragon Balls, they aren't just scattered across the earth. They're scattered throughout the entire galaxy. They could be on any planet, anywhere in the Milky Way. [MR. POPO] It could take forever to find them. [KING KAI] What Mr. Popo says is correct, Goku. Oh, well... I guess I'll just have to stay like this then. I'll grow up eventually. [DENDE] Goku! [MR. POPO] My, he's gone! Nothing ever phases that guy, does it? [siren] Now! If your men don't take a few steps back, then I'm gonna start firin', and I don't care who I hit! How can I concentrate on eating with all this ruckus? We want a car readied to take us to a waiting plane. And bring us some food while you're at it! [gunfire] All right! We'll agree to your demands. Just stop shooting at everything in sight, okay? [sirens] [lauging] You know, I was, like, really nervous to ask you out. I'm glad you said yes. Why would I have said no to you? You are the coolest guy at school. [POPELL] But I've heard in the halls from people that you're the coolest girl at school. [PAN] Well, what do you think about that? [POPELL] Oh, I think you're great! I mean... Hey... I could carry your book bag for you if you wanted. [PAN] Oh, let's go to the movies! What do you say? [POLICE CHEIF] We are sending in food and water. Please do not shoot the unarmed woman. Before we eat anything, we're gonna feed it to this security guard and see what happens. [gasps] [COP] A movie? You're kidding... We've got a hostage situation here, kid, so take your boyfriend and amscray. [COP] Come on, there's nothing to see here. [woman screams] Just what I thought! Now I'm gonna switch hostages to show you I mean business. Man... They think they can put us to sleep with this stuff? Fine! We hear you! No more games from us! Just please let the woman go! She's only a meter maid. I make the rules here! Say, I'm only in town... for a short while... [ROSHI] What do you say the two of us get together and go dancing? [LARGE WOMAN] Sometimes our older generation just doesn't know their place! It's quite disgusting. Does... that mean "no"? [dog barks] [gunfire] [explosions] [crash] I've had enough of this. They think they can ruin what could be the best date of my life?! I don't think so! Listen up... I want you guys to let that woman go! [PAN] And then I want you to hand back the money you stole from the bank. Who do you think you are, little girl?! I'm someone who's not missing any more of my date! [gun cocks] [thud] Come on! [GOKU] Excuse me... You know, guns are dangerous. [GOKU] Especially in the hands of the untrained. What? Did school let out early today? Get outta here, kid. Leave the adult stuff to the adults. That's exactly why I'm here. To take care of the adults. You got a smart mouth! Yeah, right! Hey! I appreciate you trying to help me out, little boy, but I think those guys might have you out-matched... And I doubt your mom would want you to get hurt. But you don't un-- You leave this for the big kids. I'm older and I've got much more experience than you. [PAN] Now, pick up any toys you left behind and go home... No! --Why, you... --Come on, let's go. [RED BERET] Shoot her! Shoot her! Somebody shoot that kid! [gunfire] [screams] [screams] [gunfire] This is for shooting at girls! [crash] [sighs] [PAN] Popell, there you are! Now... About that movie... Yeah, about that... Umm... Uh-huh... I just remembered...  that I've seen that movie and it's really bad, so... Gotta go! It's not... [PAN] It's not fair!! [GOKU] Are you okay? [ROSHI] Oh, Pan! What are you doing here?! Pan? Pan! Over here! Master Roshi, what are you doing here? What's with the big crowds around here? [ROSHI] Excuse me, girls, coming through. Oh, Roshi, the ladies can't get enough of ya. You know... I don't think it's that they're happy to see you. Come on! Don't you think all these hotties are thrilled to see me? [chuckles] You never change, do you, old timer? Hey... Do you know me? You look familiar. Of course I know you. It's me, Goku. [ROSHI] Don't worry, ladies. He's not my kid. You know, you do kinda look like Goku. With that pointy hair and-- [ROSHI] Goku?! Is that really you?! [ROSHI] Well, bring on the good times, my old friend is back! But... what are you doing shrunk down to the size of a child, you adorable little tike?! [crash] [PAN] That can't be right. [PAN] There's no way that kid could be my grandpa, is there? Well? Tell me... This much curiosity could kill a man my age. Emperor Pilaf summoned Shenron and accidentally wished for me to be smaller. [laughs] [PAN] This whole day has got to be some kind of bad dream. I wonder if ChiChi's mad at me for being gone so long? Uh... It is ChiChi. [PAN] You are not my grandpa! I've got stuffed animals at home bigger than you! So... That would make you... my granddaughter, Pan! {ROSHI] Yep. She's grown up a lot. [ROSHI] It's been years since you last saw her. Well, I'm real proud of you, Pan. [GOKU] I guess fighting is in the genes. [sobbing] [GOHAN] So they caught you off guard, huh? I had no idea that the dragon was there when I walked in. Then Pilaf made the wish and poof! Here I am. And now I have a pint sized grandpa who looks like he should still be in diapers. I was already aging faster than him as it was, but this... it's unnatural! I bet you did this on purpose! No, I liked being old. Really, I did. Dad... Let's think here... The Dragon Balls are spread across the entire galaxy, right? [GOKU] Uh-huh. That's what Mr. Popo said. [crying] If that's the case, it might be easier for you to just grow up like any other child. Can you imagine someone my age married to someone like this?! [crying] [KING KAI] Goku! Can you hear me? We sure can, King Kai. [KING KAI] Good. Then listen carefully... [KING KAI] I'm afraid I have bad news. I've done some research on the Black Star Dragon Balls, and what I dug up is quite unsettling. Just how unsettling? Now that a wish has been made, the Earth is in danger of exploding unless all of the Black Star Dragon Balls are found and returned to Earth within one year! [KING KAI] You see, when a wish has been made using the Black Star Dragon Balls, the negative energy left behind begins to take over the planet, causing massive instability and eventual self destruction. What? King Kai, you've got to be kidding! You mean we have one year to get the balls back or kaboom?! That's exactly right. [thunderclap] [NARRATOR] With less than one year to travel the universe and gather the mysterious Black Star Dragon Balls, Goku and his friends stare into an uncertain future. Will the inadvertent wish of a clumsy old foe be the beginning of the end for the planet Earth? Find out as the journey gets underway on the next Dragon Ball GT!
