[SPEAKING ARABIC] [LAUGHTER] [BEEPING] Reporter: AT LAST COUNT, THE DEAD IN LAS VEGAS NUMBER 532 PLUS ANOTHER 212 INJURED. ALMOST ALL THESE MEMBERS OF A UNITED STATES ARMY RESERVE UNIT AND THEIR FAMILIES WHO WERE THERE TO CELEBRATE THEIR FIRST 4TH OF JULY BACK HOME. Reporter #2: THE LAS VEGAS HOTEL BOMBING, THE FIRST SUCCESSFUL ATTACK ON AMERICAN SOIL SINCE SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 NOW CONFIRMED TO HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT BY WILHELMINA VAN DER HULST A DUTCH CITIZEN AND MUSLIM CONVERT WHOSE HUSBAND IS BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN KILLED BY U.S. FORCES WHILE FIGHTING AS AN INSURGENT IN IRAQ. [KEYS RATTLING] [BEEPING] Man: AGENT DIAZ? YEAH? YEAH, SEND HIM IN. IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU, DARWYN. IS IT TRUE THE CIA HAVE A LEAD ON FARIK'S LOCATION? WHERE THE HELL DID YOU HEAR THAT? COME ON, EDGAR... YOU OWE ME THIS MUCH. I DESERVE TO KNOW IF IT'S TRUE. THEY TOLD ME YOU STILL HAVEN'T REPORTED TO THE POST TRAUMATIC STRESS UNIT. ANSWER MY QUESTION... PLEASE. THE CIA... THINKS TO HAVE A LINE ON WHERE HE'S HIDING. APPARENTLY HE'S BEEN SENDING MESSAGES BACK AND FORTH TO HIS AL QAEDA BROTHERS BY PIGGY-BACKING ON A WEB SERVER FOR SOME INTERNET PORN SITE. TURNS OUT THE ADULT ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY IS ON THE CUTTING EDGE OF WEB SECURITY TECHNOLOGY. THE PORNOGRAPHER WHOSE SITE FARIK WAS USING HACKED HIS WAY BACK INTO FARIK'S TRANSMISSION. EVEN NSA WAS IMPRESSED WITH THE GUY. AND STARTING WHERE HE LEFT OFF THEY WERE ABLE TO TRACE THE SOURCE PHYSICALLY... TO YEMEN. AND THAT'S WHERE HE'S HOLED UP. IT LOOKS THAT WAY. CIA ARE GONNA SEND IN A CAPTURE TEAM TO BAG HIM? THINGS ARE TIGHT RIGHT NOW. THE STATE DEPARTMENT SAYS THE PR WAR IN THE ARAB STREET IS GOING AGAINST US. BADLY. IRAQ, LEBANON. THE PEOPLE AT THE TOP FIGURE ANY DIRECT ACTION IN YEMEN WILL DO US MORE HARM THAN GOOD. AND THE SPOOKS AT THE CIA ARE PUSHING HARD BUT BEST CASE SCENARIO THEY WON'T GET THE GREEN LIGHT FOR MONTHS. AND BY THAT TIME FARIK WILL BE LONG GONE. THANK YOU... FOR TELLING ME. [SIGHING] IF YOU REALLY WANNA THANK ME, TRY AND MAKE IT TO THE PTS UNIT SOON. OK? Darwyn: JIMMY G. DARWYN! LOOK AT YOU, MAN. HUH? HOW YOU BEEN? I'M COOL. SO, DO YOU BELIEVE THAT SHIT IN VEGAS, MAN? BIN LADEN STRIKES AGAIN. I HEARD FROM GM CHAN, YOU MADE THE NEW SPEC OPS JUST BEFORE 9/11. YOU HAVE MY OVERDUE CONGRATULATIONS, MAN. THANKS, MAN. IT WAS THE PERFECT TIMING. I MEAN, IF YOU LIKE TO KEEP BUSY. HMM. I HEARD YOU WENT TO WORK AT THE FBI ABOUT THE SAME TIME, MAN. YEAH, THAT'S ABOUT RIGHT. YOU STILL WITH THE BUREAU? MM-HMM. HOW IS THAT? HIGH SPEED LOW DRAG OR WHAT? SAME AS EVERYWHERE ELSE, MAN. SOME PEOPLE ARE HIGH SPEED LOW DRAG, SOME ARE A LITTLE SLOWER. NOT WITH THE D-BOYS. YOU SLOW DOWN THERE AND ONE WAY OR ANOTHER YOU ARE NOT LONG FOR THE WORLD. I FUCKING LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT, THOUGH. SO YOU WENT STRAIGHT FROM DELTA TO CIA? DARWYN, YOU AND ME GO WAY, WAY BACK. YOU KNOW I CAN'T TALK TO YOU ABOUT THAT STUFF. YEAH. LISTEN, JIMMY, I NEED TO GET INTO CONTACT WITH SOMEBODY FROM THE AGENCY, MAN. YOU'RE AN FBI AGENT, PICK UP THE PHONE. THIS HAS NOTING TO DO WITH THE BUREAU. IT'S ALL PERSONAL. YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSONAL CONTACT I HAVE IN THAT WORLD. WHO'S THIS GUY YOU'RE LOOKING FOR? I DON'T KNOW HIS NAME. ALL I KNOW IS HE WAS HALF OF A TWO-MAN INTERROGATION TEAM THAT WORKED ON SAAD BIN SAFWAN AKA FARIS AL-FARIK. HE'S A SAUDI TARGET I HELPED TAKE DOWN LAST YEAR. DODGER STADIUM ATTACK. YOU WORKED THAT? HOOAH. I GUESS RANGERS DO LEAD THE WAY, HUH? LET ME TALK TO SOME PEOPLE. [BIRDS CAWING] CAN I HELP YOU WITH SOMETHING? [SIGHING] MY NAME IS DARWYN AL-HAK... DARWYN AL-SAYEED, SIR. I AM A... WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. HOLD UP. I KNOW WHO YOU ARE. SHIT, MAN! I THOUGHT YOU WERE AN URBAN LEGEND. AFRICAN-AMERICAN MUSLIM WORKING UNDERCOVER FOR THE BUREAU.

PLEASE, MR. ERSKINE-- PATRICK. YEAH, PATRICK. I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT A MUTUAL ACQUAINTANCE OF OURS. HIS NAME'S SAAD BIN SAFWAN BUT I KNOW HIM AS FARIS AL-FARIK. LET'S TAKE A WALK. NO BULLSHIT. WHAT THE HELL DO YOU WANT? I KNOW FARIK WAS HEAVILY INVOLVED IN PLANNING THE LAS VEGAS ATTACK AND THAT HE WAS BEHIND THE MURDER OF SOME PEOPLE VERY CLOSE TO ME. THE SAME WAY HE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATH OF SOMEONE CLOSE TO YOU, YOUR PARTNER. ROBERT MCHENRY. BOB. GO ON. I WANT FARIK BUT I NEED YOUR HELP. YOU HAVE ACCESS TO FARIK'S AGENCY FILES, INTEL ON THE TARGET, COMMUNICATIONS OVERSEAS... SO YOU'RE JUST ANOTHER MUSLIM FANATIC TOO, HUH? IS THAT IT? YOU JUST GO AT IT FROM A DIFFERENT ANGLE. PATRICK, I AM A MUSLIM AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHY I CAN GET TO HIM. ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS? LISTEN, JIHAD JOE, EVEN IF YOU COULD GET TO HIM, HE'S NOT STUPID. HE KNOWS YOU WERE INVOLVED IN HIS FUCKED-UP DODGER STADIUM ATTACK. AND EVEN IF HE HASN'T FIGURED OUT THAT YOU'RE A SWORN OFFICER OF THE FBI HE DAMN WELL KNOWS YOU'RE COMPROMISED. IT WOULD BE A SUICIDE MISSION. WILL YOU HELP ME? UN-FUCKING-BELIEVABLE. AMERICANS ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE HOT FOR SUICIDE MISSIONS. THAT'S JUST KAMIKAZE PILOTS FROM WORLD WAR II AND YOUR CO-RELIGIONISTS FROM THE MIDDLE EAST. WILL YOU HELP ME? [CHUCKLES] [SIGHING] *** [KNOCKING] [SIGHING, CLEARS THROAT] WHAT THE HELL DO YOU WANT? I...UH...I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO REACH YOU BUT YOU HAVEN'T RETURNED ANY OF MY CALLS. WHAT DO YOU EXPECT? DARWYN, YOU KILLED MY SISTER. I KNOW YOU DIDN'T TECHNICALLY KILL HER BUT SHE'S DEAD ALL THE SAME BECAUSE OF YOU. THAT'S THE TRUTH AND YOU KNOW IT. *** I CAME BY FOR TWO REASONS. UM... ONE WAS TO GIVE YOU THIS. WHAT IS IT? MONEY. HELP OUT WITH MARCUS. I KNOW... YOU AND JIM HAVE TWO KIDS OF YOUR OWN, ONE ON THE WAY. HOW MUCH WAS MY SISTER'S LIFE WORTH? THERE'S $75,000 IN THERE. OK. WE CAN USE IT. WHAT'S THE OTHER REASON YOU CAME? I, UH...I'M GOING AWAY TOMORROW MORNING AND, UH... I DON'T KNOW WHEN I'M GONNA BE BACK. HOPING I COULD...UH... JUST SEE MARCUS... SAY GOOD-BYE. [SNIFFING] MARCUS? HONEY, THERE'S SOMEONE TO SEE YOU. DARWYN! [SIREN BLARING] [BACKGROUND CHATTER] ARRRGH! YOUR HUSBAND SENT ME. OK? SAAD SENT ME. WHO ARE YOU? HE'S DEAD. [SOBBING] HE'S ALIVE. SAAD IS ALIVE! [SOBBING] WHO ARE YOU? MY NAME IS DARWYN AL-HAKIM. I WAS A MUJAHID IN THE FAITHFUL UNIT YOUR HUSBAND LED IN LOS ANGELES BEFORE HE WAS CAPTURED. AND YOU WERE RELEASED FROM AMERICAN CUSTODY BECAUSE EVERYONE DOES THINK HE'S DEAD. BUT HE MADE CONTACT WITH ME THREE DAYS AGO. HE TOLD ME WHERE YOU WERE. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. SAMIA, YOUR HUSBAND SENT ME TO FIND YOU AND BRING YOU TO HIM. *** I...I DON'T BELIEVE YOU. THIS IS SOME SORT OF A TRICK! NO, NO, NO! HE...HE...HE TOLD ME YOUR DAUGHTER'S NAME WAS ASMA AND THAT YOU SPOKE TO HIM ONLY ONCE WHILE YOU BOTH WERE IN CUSTODY OVER A COMPUTER VIDEO CONFERENCE. I WALK THROUGH THE STREETS LIKE A GHOST. MY PHONES ARE TAPPED. BRITISH INTELLIGENCE FOLLOWS ME EVERYWHERE I GO. I'M NOT A PERSON ANYMORE. [SIGHING] MY HEART HAS BEEN TAKEN AWAY FROM ME. [SOBBING] I'M HERE... TO GIVE IT BACK TO YOU. PACK ONE BAG. SOME FRIENDS IN THE BROTHERHOOD GOT YOU A FAKE PASSPORT AND ARE GONNA HELP US GET OUT OF THIS COUNTRY. BUT FIRST...FIRST WE HAVE TO LOSE YOUR TAIL. *** [PHONE RINGING] [SIGHING] HELLO, PATRICK. IT'S BEEN A WHILE. GLAD TO SEE YOU STILL RECOGNIZE MY NUMBER, ALISTAIR. HOW'S IT HANGING? FINE AS USUAL. SO... WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU? I GOT A LITTLE FAVOR TO ASK. I FIGURED YOU STILL OWED ME ONE, SINCE I SAVED YOUR ASS FROM THOSE MICK DICKHEADS ON COVENTRY STREET THAT NIGHT. WHAT THE FUCK, MAN? WERE YOU GOING TO SEE MAMMA MIA AGAIN? I KNOW YOU THINK ALL BRITS ARE GAY, PATRICK, BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN MAMMA MIA. THOUGH I DO ADMIT TO OWING YOU THAT FAVOR. I'M GONNA GIVE YOU A NAME. THEN I'M GONNA NEED YOU TO LET THIS SUBJECT SLIP THROUGH ANY BRITISH AIRPORT AT WILL. Alistair: EXACTLY HOW LONG ARE WE TALKING? 12 HOURS TOPS, AL. [SIGHING] GIVE ME THE NAME. AND, UH, DON'T EVER CALL ME AL AGAIN. *** *** [LIVELY CHATTER] THANK YOU FOR DOING THIS, DARWYN. I CAN NEVER REPAY YOU. YOU KNOW, UM, FARIK...SAAD... HE TOLD ME A LOT WHEN WE WERE TOGETHER IN LOS ANGELES. NOT EVERYTHING, OF COURSE. SO HOW LONG HAVE YOU TWO BEEN MARRIED? 14 YEARS IN MAY. OUR WEDDING... WAS A BEAUTIFUL CEREMONY. YOU ONLY KNEW ONE SIDE OF SAAD... THE SOLDIER, HOLY WARRIOR. BUT HE'S ALSO A LOVING HUSBAND AND A DEVOTED FATHER. LIKE THE PROPHET, SALLALLAAHU ALAYHI WA SALLAAM. MUHAMMAD IS THE MESSENGER OF GOD AND THOSE WHO FOLLOW HIM ARE HARSH TOWARDS THE DISBELIEVERS AND COMPASSIONATE TOWARDS EACH OTHER. HOW LONG BEFORE I CAN SEE HIM? UH...THAT'S UP TO HIM. [SIGHING] I'M GOING TO HEAD OUT. MAKE THE FIRST MOVE TOWARDS CONTACT. OK. I'M GOING TO WASH UP AND GET SOME REST. JUST MAKE SURE THE DOOR IS LOCKED. BYE. I WILL. *** [MAN SPEAKING ARABIC] [BACKGROUND CHATTER] [BACKGROUND CHATTER] [BACKGROUND CHATTER] *** Darwyn: SIBYLLA? SALADIN? ASSALAAMU ALAIKUM. ALAIKUM ASSALAAM. A GLOCK 19 PISTOL, MOSTLY PLASTIC. AND THE GLOBALSTAR SAT-PHONE. THANK YOU. DON'T THANK ME, THANK ERSKINE. HE'S THE ONLY REASON I'M HELPING YOU. YOU HAVE SOME KIND OF PROBLEM WITH ME? I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH YOUR OPERATION. THE AGENCY ISN'T SUPPOSED TO BE IN THE MARTYRDOM BUSINESS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. I HAVE AN EXFILTRATION PLAN. I KNOW. I READ IT, IT'S A JOKE. DON'T... DON'T TRY AND JUDGE ME. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT I'VE SEEN. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT I'VE BEEN THROUGH. *** [CHATTER] *** [CLICKING] YOU SEE THE KEY IS TO PATTERN YOUR OPERATIONAL ORGANIZATION ON THESE. GRAPES? BUNCHES OF GRAPES. THOUGH THEY ALL GROW ON THE SAME VINE, EACH BUNCH IS... SELF-CONTAINED, ISOLATED. IF ONE GRAPE IS CONTAMINATED, COMPROMISED, THEN THE OTHER GRAPES IN THE BUNCH WILL BE LOST BUT THE REST OF THE VINE WILL STAY INTACT. THE SAME HOLDS TRUE FOR YOUR FAITHFUL UNITS, YOUR CELLS. AS LONG AS YOU LIMIT THE KNOWLEDGE AND CONNECTIONS OF EACH CELL MEMBER. EACH GRAPE. FORGIVE THE INTRUSION, BROTHER FARIK, BROTHER... NO, NO, NO FORGIVENESS NECESSARY, BROTHER ILIJA. IT'S TIME I WENT TO BED. *** I'VE A GOOD FEELING ABOUT HIM. HE REMINDS ME A LITTLE OF YOU. FARIK, THERE'S SOMETHING YOU NEED TO SEE. WHAT IS THIS? OUR PEOPLE IN SANA'A TOOK THEM EARLIER TODAY. [CALL TO PRAYER] I'LL MEET YOU RIGHT HERE AFTER THE SERVICE. [CALL TO PRAYER CONTINUES] Men: ALLAHU AKBAR. Imam: ALLAHU AKBAR. Men: ALLAHU AKBAR. Imam: ALLAHU AKBAR. Women: ALLAHU AKBAR.

[CHATTER] *** *** PEACE BE UPON YOU, BROTHER. AND ALSO UPON YOU. NICE HAIR. COME. WE HAVE SOMEWHERE TO BE. *** Darwyn: SAMIA, I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE YOU TO AN OLD FRIEND OF MINE, ILIJA KORJENIC. IT WILL BE MY HONOR TO BRING YOU TO YOUR HUSBAND AND OUR MUTUAL FRIEND. A GREAT REUNION IS AT HAND. I PICKED UP THIS PRETTY COOL COVER VERSION OF A SONG WE BOTH KNOW... BUT THESE GUYS DON'T REALLY APPRECIATE IT. * I LEFT MY WALLET IN EL SEGUNDO * * I LEFT MY WALLET IN EL SEGUNDO * * LEFT MY WALLET IN EL SEGUNDO * * I GOTTA GET IT, I GOT-GOT TO GET IT * * MY MOTHER WENT AWAY FOR A MONTH LONG TRIP * * HER AND SOME FRIENDS ON AN OCEAN-LINER SHIP * * SHE MADE A BIG MISTAKE BY LEAVING ME HOME * * I HAD TO ROAM SO I PICKED UP THE PHONE * * 490 MADISON AV', YO, WE HERE, SHA * * HE SAID, "ALL RIGHT, TIP, SEE YOU TOMORROW" * * THINKING ABOUT THE PAST WEEK, THE LAST WEEK * * HANDS GO DOWN IN MY POCKETS, I CAN'T SPEAK * * HOP IN THE CAR AND TORPEED TO THE SHACK OF SHAHEED * * "WE GOTTA GO BACK!" * HE SAID, "WHY?" I SAID, "WE GOT TO GO" * * "'CAUSE I LEFT MY WALLET IN EL SEGUNDO" * * I LEFT MY WALLET IN EL SEGUNDO * * LEFT MY WALLET IN EL SEGUNDO * * I GOTTA GET IT, I GOT-GOT TO GET IT * * COME ON, LET'S GO * COME ON, LET'S GO! * COME ON, LET'S GO! [CHILDREN SHOUTING] HELLO! *** SAAD! SAMIA. I'M ONLY HERE BECAUSE OF YOUR FRIEND, BROTHER DARWYN AL-HAKIM. HE FOUND ME AND HE BROUGHT ME TO YOU. HE SMUGGLED ME OUT OF LONDON THROUGH YEMEN. WE OWE HIM EVERYTHING. DARWYN. MY BROTHER. WE'RE ALL SO GRATEFUL TO YOU. AREN'T WE, ILIJA? OF COURSE WE ARE. I--I MUST SEE TO IT THAT YOU RECEIVE A MIGHTY REWARD. THANK YOU... ...FOR EVERYTHING. BROTHER DARWYN... ...AL-SAYEED OF THE FBI! SAAD! Samia: ARE YOU MAD? WHAT ARE YOU DOING? THIS MAN...! SAAD! ...IS A SPY! Samia: WHAT ARE YOU DOING? AN AGENT WORKING FOR THE AMERICANS. AN ASSASS... FARIK! ALL THE BROTHERS ARE WATCHING AND YOU ARE OUR LEADER. OUR EXAMPLE OF DISCIPLINED SELF-CONTROL. [DARWYN GROANING] SEARCH HIM. JUST THESE. YOU SEE, SAMIA, HE HAS TRICKED YOU SO HE COULD GET CLOSE ENOUGH TO STAB THIS INTO MY HEART OR SHOOT THIS INTO MY HEAD. I--I--I DON'T UNDERSTAND. SAMIA, HE'S BEEN LYING TO YOU THIS WHOLE TIME. I TRUSTED YOU. [SOBBING] WE ALL TRUSTED HIM, MY LOVE. AND HE BETRAYED US ALL. SAAD, WAIT. I'M SORRY. I SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE CAREFUL. MORE SUSPICIOUS. IT'S ALL RIGHT. IT'S ALL RIGHT. MY MEN HAVE BEEN WATCHING SINCE YOU'VE ARRIVED. THEY'VE BEEN RUNNING COUNTER-SURVEILLANCE ON BOTH OF YOU. THERE ARE NO AMERICAN RENDITION TEAMS, NO DELTA FORCE COMMANDOS. THE FOOL CAME HERE BY HIMSELF. *** SPEAK ENGLISH. IT'S AN INSULT TO HEAR THE LANGUAGE OF THE PROPHET COMING FROM YOUR KAFFIR LIPS. WHEN DID YOU KNOW? I SUSPECTED SABOTAGE WHEN THE TRUCK BOMB DIDN'T GO OFF AT DODGER STADIUM BUT I COULDN'T BE SURE IT WAS YOU. IT COULD HAVE BEEN THE PRICE I HAD TO PAY FOR YOU REFUSING TO STOP FUCKING THAT GIRL BISHOP. THE ONE WHO WENT BITCHING TO THE LAPD. IS THAT WHY YOU HAD HER KILLED? HER DEATH WAS YOUR FAULT, NOT MINE. WHAT WERE YOU THINKING GETTING INVOLVED WITH A CIVILIAN ANYWAY? SHE WAS DOOMED THE DAY SHE MET YOU. SHE WAS INNOCENT. JUST LIKE MY WIFE WHO SPENT MONTHS IN AN AMERICAN MILITARY PRISON. YOUR WIFE KNEW WHAT YOU WERE DOING, WHO YOU WERE. SHE'S HARDCORE, DEVOTED TO THE CAUSE. YOU MUST BE VERY PROUD. TELL ME, HOW... HOW DID IT FEEL, HMM? HOW DID IT FEEL LYING TO GAYLE ALL THAT TIME THE WAY YOU LIED TO ME? I WONDER, DID YOU EVER GET THE CHANCE TO TELL HER WHO YOU REALLY WERE? YOU KNOW, BEFORE SHE DIED? [CHILDREN LAUGHING OUTSIDE] WHAT'S WITH ALL THE KIDS? THEY'RE JUST... CHILDREN FROM THE VILLAGE. THEY LIKE TO COME HERE AND PLAY. WE GIVE THEM CANDY, MONEY, TOY GUNS. THE NEXT GENERATION OF JIHAD JUST WAITING FOR SOME COLD, MANIPULATIVE BASTARD LIKE YOU TO LEAD THEM INTO THE STRUGGLE AND THEN HIDE BEHIND THEM WHEN THE BULLETS START FLYING. TELL ME, FARIK, WHAT DOES THE HOLY QUR'AN SAY ABOUT HUMAN SHIELDS? DON'T YOU DARE QUOTE THE QUR'AN TO ME. IT IS THE WORD OF GOD BUT IT WAS WRITTEN WHEN ARMIES WERE BRAVE MEN RIDING INTO BATTLE AGAINST OTHER BRAVE MEN. LOOKING EACH OTHER IN THE EYE UNTIL DEATH CAME TO WHOMEVER WAS WEAKER. NOW ARMIES ARE MADE OF COMPUTER CHIPS AND... AND MOLDED PLASTIC. KILLING IS DONE BY COWARDS PRESSING BUTTONS. LIKE THE BUTTON ON THE DETONATOR OF A SUICIDE BOMB. *** YOU CAN TWIST MY WORDS... BUT YOU CAN'T TWIST MY WILL. I KNOW WHAT I DO IS RIGHT. CAN YOU SAY THE SAME? I LIVE FOR GOD, I WILL DIE FOR GOD AND I WILL KILL FOR GOD. YOU? YOU'RE JUST HERE FOR REVENGE. ACCORDING TO YOU REVENGE IS PERMITTED IN THE HOLY QUR'AN, NO PROBLEM. SURAH 2, VERSE 178. "O YOU WHO BELIEVE, "THE LAW OF EQUALITY IS PRESCRIBED FOR YOU "IN CASE OF MURDER. THE FREE FOR THE FREE, THE SLAVE FOR THE SLAVE..." I TOLD YOU... NOT TO QUOTE THE QUR'AN TO ME. ILIJA! AJIJUL! TAKE HIM OUT. *** I WANT TO THANK YOU... BECAUSE I'VE NEVER HAD THE PLEASURE OF SEEING A TRAITOR EXECUTED BEFORE. IT SHOULD BE FUCKING AWESOME. [SHOUTS IN ARABIC] [SPEAKS ARABIC] HE'S A YOUNG MAN... LIKE WE USED TO BE. I WENT BACK HOME. TO SARAJEVO. IT WAS BEAUTIFUL. *** SO WHY'D YOU LEAVE? [WHISPERING] DARWYN... ...ALTHOUGH YOU CARRY A GREAT WEIGHT ON YOUR SHOULDERS... ...YOU HOLD YOURSELF RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATH OF SOMEONE YOU LOVED. BUT FOR YOU, ALL THAT WEIGHT WILL SOON BE GONE. ILIJA? IS THIS TRUE ISLAM? YOU KNOW IT ISN'T! ILIJA? [GRUNTING] NOW, WERE YOU... WERE YOU GONNA SHOOT ME OR STAB ME? IT'S A PRETTY PATHETIC PLAN TO THINK YOU COULD KILL ME THIS WAY. ANYWAY, YOUR DEATH WON'T LAST LONG ENOUGH BUT IT WILL LIVE FOREVER. I'M RECORDING THIS SO THE FAITHFUL ALL OVER THE WORLD CAN SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO A MUSLIM WHO BETRAYS HIS PEOPLE. THAT WASN'T MY PLAN. WHAT? TO SHOOT YOU. OR STAB YOU. *** THAT WASN'T MY PLAN. YOU DIDN'T LET ME FINISH MY VERSE FROM THE HOLY QUR'AN. "THE FREE FOR THE FREE, "THE SLAVE FOR THE SLAVE AND THE FEMALE FOR THE FEMALE." *** SAAD! SAAD! SAMIA! NO! THAT'S A DIRECT HIT ON THE CAMP, MR. ERSKINE. SABILA, CAN YOU CONFIRM THAT THE TARGET WAS DESTROYED? NEGATIVE. HELLFIRE STRIKE CONFIRMED BUT STATUS OF TARGET STILL UNKNOWN. COPY THAT. [SIGHING] [GROANING] ARRGH! [GUNFIRE CONTINUES] [GUNSHOTS] ARRGH! SAMIA? SAMIA? SAMIA! SAMIA? NO. SAMIA. *** SAMIA? OH, SAMIA. OH! COME ON, SAMIA, COME ON! COME ON. [GROANING] [GASPS] [PANTING] *** [SOBBING] [SCREAMING] [GROANING] [GROANING] [SCREAMING] *** [SCREAMING] COME ON! FUCK! [GRUNTS] [GASPS] [DOG BARKING] *** [GROANING] [DOG BARKING] [CHILDREN SHOUTING] [SHOUTING AND SCREAMING] [SHOUTS IN ARABIC] [SCREAMING] [SCREAMING AND SOBBING] ARRGH! [GROWLS] [SCREAMING] [GROANING AND GASPING] [ROARING] Ajijul: BROTHER FARIK! FARIK. FARIK. FARIK! [GROANING] [PANTING] [PANTING] [GROANING] [WHISPERS] HELP ME. *** * SOMEONE'S SELLING WHAT CAN'T BE BOUGHT * * SOMEONE'S CHASING WHAT CAN'T BE CAUGHT * * SOMEONE'S BUYING WHAT CAN'T BE BOUGHT * * SOMEONE'S SLEEPING IN A BED OF TEARS * * SOMEONE'S SPEAKING OF RAGE AND FEARS * * SOMEONE'S GUESS IS SOMEONE'S LESS IS MORE * * BEGINNING TO END * BEGINNING TO END * BEGINNING TO END * BEGINNING TO END * BEGINNING TO END * BEGINNING TO END * LOVE ON THE WING
