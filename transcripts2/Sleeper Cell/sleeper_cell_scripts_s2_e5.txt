 IMAGINE WHAT THEY CAN DO TO HER. IT SEEMS SALIM CAUSED QUITE A SCANDAL IN THE LONDON IRAQI COMMUNITY OVER A LITTLE LOVE AFFAIR THAT HE GOT INTO. CALL ME? THE MUJAHADEEN TAUGHT ME, HAD ME LEARN WHAT HAPPENED TO THE REST OF MY FAMILY, THAT THEY WERE ALL DEAD, TAUGHT ME HOW TO FIGHT. I NEED NEW PAPERS AND A WAY OUT OF CANADA. OF COURSE. YOU'LL BE ON A PLANE BACK TO EUROPE TOMORROW. "YOU'RE A MOM"? NANNY. BUT YOU KNOW HOW IT IS. I SPEND MORE TIME WITH THESE KIDS THAN THEIR PARENTS DO. MAYBE YOU WOULDN'T MIND ACTING AS...A GO-BETWEEN?

 YOU MEAN SPY ON DARWYN? NO FUCKING WAY! AZIZ HAS DONE HIS PART AND THE FUEL RODS ARE HEADED FOR GERMANY. Darwyn: I DID A WALK-THROUGH OF A HOSPITAL THAT WE SECURED COMPARED IT TO THE TWO THAT THE BROTHERHOOD WANTED ME TO CHECK OUT. THEY ALL SHARE ONE THING IN COMMON. RADIATION CONTAINMENT FACILITIES. THEY ARE PLANNING A NUCLEAR ATTACK. YOUR OLD FRIEND BROTHER DARWYN EL-HAKIM NOW HE IS THE LEADER OF THE CELL. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS MAN? *** [SPEAKS ARABIC] NO PROBLEM WITH THE CALL, BROTHER FARIK? NO PROBLEM. THE BEST PLACE TO HIDE IS IN A CROWD. AND THE SATELLITE TRAFFIC HERE IS AS CROWDED AS EVER. [WOMAN SPEAKING OVER PA] TV: IN IRAQ, A ROADSIDE BOMB RIPPED THROUGH A... I'M LOOKING FOR...UH... A BENJAMIN AL-SAYEED? TV: ...UNITED STATES MARINES AND 400 MORE... 67 - 68 USED TO BE CHARLIE IN THE BUSH, NOW IT IS HAJI IN THE SAND DUNE! IRAQ IS JUST ARABIC FOR VIETNAM! WELL, THE ORIGIN OF THAT WORD IS STILL BEING DEBATED. SOME PEOPLE SAY IT'S ARABIC FOR DEEP-ROOTED, OTHERS SAY IT'S ARAMAIC FOR LAND ON THE BANKS OF THE SOUTHERN RIVERS. PHIL. THIS IS MY SON... DARWYN. AUTHORITY ON IRAQ. HOW'D YOU KNOW I WAS HERE? MOM CALLED. WHAT DID SHE TELL YOU? SHE SAID YOUR NEIGHBOR FOUND YOU LAID OUT ON THE PORCH. AMBULANCE BROUGHT YOU IN FOR INSULIN SHOCK. YOU LEFT BEFORE YOU WERE CLEARED AND COLLAPSED IN THE PARKING LOT. HIT YOUR HEAD AND BROKE YOUR ARM. CAN YOU GIVE US A MINUTE, PLEASE? WHAT'S THE MATTER, DARWYN? DON'T TRUST ME? AFRAID I'LL START BLABBING ABOUT YOU BEING AN FBI AGENT? LIKE THAT'S SOMETHING I WOULD TELL ANYBODY ABOUT! BUT IT'S NICE TO SEE THE FBI'S TAUGHT YOU TO JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS BASED ON SECOND-HAND INFORMATION. THE DOCTOR SAID THE SAME THING MOM SAID ABOUT YOUR DIABETES... THE SAME TRIED AND TRUE TACTICS THEY USE FOR COINTELLPRO. COUNTER INTELLIGENCE PROGRAM. THE FED'S GRAND SCHEME TO TAKE DOWN THE BLACK PANTHER PARTY AND THE NATION OF ISLAM OF WHICH I AM A PROUD MEMBER. AND THAT WAS 40 YEARS AGO. THE FBI'S A DIFFERENT ORGANIZATION AND SO IS THE NATION. BUT THEY STILL REPRESENT THE SAME THINGS. THERE IS STILL THEIR NATION AND OUR NATION. WELL, YOUR NATION IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATH OF MALCOLM. ALL RIGHT THEN, BOY, YOU DONE CHECKED ON ME. JUST LIKE YOUR MOTHER ASKED. YOU CAN GO NOW. YOU'VE DONE YOUR GOOD DEED FOR THE DAY. I'LL SEE YOU AROUND, POPS. *** [SPEAKS ARABIC] DADDY! [* POP ON RADIO] SO WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL? BECAUSE I'M STRONGER THAN YOU. SURE ABOUT THAT? I'VE SEEN WHAT YOU BENCH PRESS. YOU MAKE JOKES. DON'T YOU EVER THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE DOING? HOW YOU MAKE IT UP TO GOD? I HAD NO IDEA YOU WERE A BIBLE THUMPER. I'M NOT A BIBLE THUMPER! HEY, TAKE IT EASY, MAN. JUST... ...A FIGURE OF SPEECH. *** BESIDES ALL YOU REALLY WANNA DO RIGHT NOW IS THROW ME UP AGAINST THAT LOCKER AND FUCK ME. WHERE I COME FROM WHAT GOD SAYS ISN'T DEBATED. IT'S THE LAW. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY WOULD DO IF THEY SAW WHAT WE DID TOGETHER? THEY'D THROW US BOTH OFF THE HIGHEST BRIDGE OR...STONE US TO DEATH OR...DIG A PIT, THROW US IN AND COLLAPSE A WALL ON TOP OF US. OK. ENOUGH, THANKS. CHRIST. LOOK... YOU ARE STRONG. IT'S NOT A MATTER OF SELF CONTROL, THIS THING INSIDE YOU THAT YOU HATE SO MUCH BECAUSE YOU CAN'T CONTROL IT? MAYBE YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO CONTROL IT. MAYBE THAT'S HOW GOD MADE YOU. YOU GOT MY NUMBER. *** [* HIP-HOP] I GOT A NEW URL AND A SECURE ID CODE. ORDERS ARE TO PICK UP THE SHIPMENT WEDNESDAY NIGHT PORT OF L.A., BERTH 206. OFF A FREIGHTER FROM BAHRAIN. YOU THINK IT'S A NUCLEAR PAYLOAD? NO WAY TO KNOW FOR SURE BUT THAT'S WHERE MY MONEY IS. WELL, WE'VE ALERTED THE IAEA. GONNA LET US KNOW IMMEDIATELY ABOUT ANY AND ALL RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL THAT MAY HAVE TURNED OUT MISSING. GOOD, I'M GONNA HAVE SALIM TEST FOR ANY RADIATION LEAKS AS A FAILSAFE. IT'S A GOOD WAY TO KEEP HIM BUSY. WELL, I'LL START COORDINATING IMMEDIATELY WITH DHS AND L.A. HARBOR DEPARTMENT AND WE'LL HAVE TEAMS READY TO GRAB THE SHIPMENT AND PICK UP ALL THE CELL MEMBERS WEDNESDAY NIGHT. NOW YOU'RE SURE THIS IS EVERYTHING? RIGHT? I'M SUPPOSED TO ASK FOR A GUY FROM CRESCENT CARGO ONCE I GET THERE. THAT'S IT. CRESCENT CARGO. OK. CHEER UP, MAN. A FEW MORE DAYS, IT WILL ALL BE OVER. *** Darwyn: WE NEED TO TEST THE CONTAINMENT LINERS ON BOTH THE COOLER AND THE SUITCASE. WHY? I FOLLOWED THE SPECS EXACTLY. WE STILL NEED TO TEST THEM. OUR MISSION DEPENDS ON TAKING THEM TO THEIR TARGETS WITHOUT ANYBODY KNOWING WHAT'S INSIDE. IF OUR SKIN IS BURNING OFF, THEY MIGHT GET A PRETTY GOOD IDEA. FINE. THEY ARE BUILT TO BLOCK HIGH LEVEL GAMMA RADIATION. IT'S NOT LIKE THOSE KINDS OF RADIONUCLIDES COME IN HAPPY MEALS. I TRY TO GET A DROP OF THAT STUFF, I GOT THE ENTIRE DEPARTMENT AT HOMELAND SECURITY JUMPING ME. NOT IF YOU USE AMERICIUM 241. COULD YOU RING THIS UP, PLEASE? MARCUS, DON'T YOU DARE SPILL THAT, OK? GRANDMA GAVE YOU THAT SHIRT AND I WANT IT SPOTLESS WHEN SHE GETS HERE. I GOT IT. I GOT IT. YOU'VE BEEN SMOKING AGAIN, HUH? YEAH...SMOKING AGAIN. THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT BEING STALKED BY A PSYCHOTIC YOU-KNOW-WHATORIST STRESSES ME OUT. I SWEAR THE MORE I LEARN, THE LESS I GET HOW YOUR BELIEFS COME OUT OF THE SAME PLACE AS THESE PSYCHOS. SURE IT'S NOT YOUR MOTHER-IN-LAW COMING THAT'S STRESSING YOU OUT? NO, I'M PRETTY SURE IT'S HAVING TO WATCH MY FUCKING BACK 24/7. I TOLD YOU YOU SHOULD LEAVE TOWN. OH, THAT'S GREAT, DARWYN. YEAH I...I LEAVE TOWN AND THEN WHAT? JEOPARDIZE YOUR ENTIRE CASE? AND THEN I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR THE NEXT 9/11? NO, I DON'T THINK SO. OR MAYBE YOU GETTING HURT? I DON'T THINK I CAN HANDLE THAT. LOOK, GAYLE, THIS WHOLE THING'S GONNA BE OVER, BUT... HERE'S SOME ORANGE JUICE. WHAT? OH! SORRY, BUDDY. UH-OH. OH, LET ME GET YOU A TOWEL. OH, GOD! NO, NO, NO, LOOK, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. LOOK, DARWYN, MAYBE YOU SHOULD JUST GO, OK? I...REALLY I... I GOT A LOT OF CLEANING TO DO. HEY, DARWYN? YOU KNOW, 4TH OF JULY IS COMING UP AND I WAS THINKING, I KNOW IT'S HARD FOR YOU TO GO OUT WITH US THESE DAYS BUT... MAYBE WE COULD ALL DO SOMETHING? MAYBE TAKE SOMEONE TO SEE SOME F-I-R-E-W-O-R-K-S. I DON'T KNOW. I'LL TRY. [WOMAN SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] AH! I WISH MUM COULD BE HERE. ME TOO. SHE'S A VERY GOOD RIDER. ALMOST AS GOOD AS YOU. WHEN IS SHE GOING TO BE DONE WITH THE SPECIAL TRIP? I DON'T KNOW. THAT'S PART OF WHAT MAKES IT A SPECIAL TRIP. MY FRIEND ANNE, HER MUM WENT ON A BOAT TO THE SOUTH POLE AND THEY COULD TALK TO HER ON THE PHONE. WELL, YOUR MOTHER IS NOT ANNE'S MOM AND YOU DON'T NEED TO TALK TO HER ON THE PHONE TO KNOW THAT SHE'S THINKING ABOUT YOU ALL THE TIME. NOW YOU KNOW WHAT? I THINK IT'S UP TO YOU TO RIDE ON YOUR OWN. COME ON. RIDING IS ONE OF LIFE'S... GREAT PLEASURES TO LEARN. COME ON. DANKE SCHON. JA, JA. YOU SPEAK ENGLISH? YES. GOOD, I ENJOY PRACTICING WITH YOU. ENGLISH NUMBER FOUR LANGUAGE FOR ME. HEY? NUMBER FOUR. I BE MOST SMART DRIVER ON ROAD. I AM THE SMARTEST DRIVER ON THE ROAD. NO, NO. I AM THE SMARTEST DRIVER ON THE ROAD. [LAUGHS] UH, WHERE ARE YOU GOING? SARAJEVO. SARAJEVO? [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] YOU HAVE GOOD LUCK, MY FRIEND! MY TRUCK GOES TO SARAJEVO. YOU GO HOME? YES. [SPEAKS BOSNIAN] AH... MY WIFE, SHE IS ALSO MUSLIM. HER FAMILY THEY SHIT PANTS WHEN THEY HEAR I AM A SERBIAN. SARAJEVO DIFFERENT WORLD, BROTHER. DIFFERENT WORLD NOW. BEFORE I KILL YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE MUSLIM YOU'LL KILL ME FOR BEING SERB. NOT ANY MORE. TODAY I INVITE YOU TO MY TRUCK AND I CARRY YOU HOME AS A GOOD NEIGHBOR. THAT'S HOW IT IS, OK? OK? IT'S NOT EASY TO FORGET... BUT WE TRY FORGIVE. [SLOWLY] WE WILL TRY TO FORGIVE. WE WILL TRY TO FORGIVE. [SPEAKING BOSNIAN] FUCK ENGLISH! PAIN IN MY FUCKING ASS THAT LANGUAGE, HUH? Darwyn: HOW IS THE TEST GOING? [SIGHING] I FEEL LIKE MY UNCLE HECTOR. SHELLING PEANUTS IN A FACTORY UP NORTH. WHY THE HELL DO WE NEED SO MANY? WELL, EACH ONE OF THEM CONTAINS TRACE AMOUNTS OF AMERICIUM 241 WHICH EMITS ALPHA PARTICLES AND GAMMA RAYS AND GAMMA RAYS CAN PENETRATE LEAD AND THAT'S WHAT SALIM'S CONTAINERS ARE FOR. BUT THERE IS SO LITTLE GAMMA RADIATION IN EACH ALARM THAT WE NEED A TON OF THEM BEFORE WE CAN TEST IF OUR CONTAINERS HAVE WEAK SPOTS. [PHONE RINGING] HELLO? UH, NO, NO. NOW'S NOT A GOOD TIME. OK, I GET YOU. O...OK. OK. I'M ON MY WAY OVER. [SIGHING] HOW MANY MORE YOU GOT LEFT? [SIGHING] TOO FUCKING MANY, MAN. KEEP AN EYE ON THINGS FOR A WHILE, HUH? I'LL BE BACK IN A COUPLE OF HOURS. IT'S TOO BIG. TOLD YOU WE CAN'T FIX IT. MOM WILL JUST BUY ME A NEW ONE. YOU SHOULD NEVER THROW SOMETHING AWAY JUST BECAUSE IT'S A LITTLE BROKEN. I PROMISE YOU AFTER WE FIX IT YOU'LL LOVE IT EVEN MORE. COS EVERY TIME YOU PLAY WITH IT, YOU KNOW YOU WERE THE ONE THAT MADE IT WORK AGAIN. ALL WE NEED IS A SMALLER ONE OF THESE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I'M SORRY, WE WANTED TO FIX CODY'S TRUCK AND... YOU KNOW MY WORK BENCH IS A PRIVATE AREA, CODY. WHAT HAVE I TOLD YOU A THOUSAND TIMES? NO, NO, NO. IT'S MY FAULT AND... I DON'T CARE WHOSE FAULT IT IS. I WANT BOTH OF YOU OUT OF HERE RIGHT NOW. RIGHT NOW! Darwyn: POP, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? LEAVING EARLY IS HOW YOU GOT HURT IN THE FIRST PLACE. HOW DID YOU KNOW I WAS GETTING OUT? YOUR BUDDIES AT THE NSA GOT MY PHONE TAPPED? THANK YOU. MOM SENT ME AGAIN. SAID SHE'S BABYSITTING AUNT HELENA'S KIDS. WANTED TO MAKE SURE YOU WERE ALL RIGHT. OH, THAT'S GREAT! YOU'VE ALWAYS DONE A GOOD JOB DOING WHAT YOUR MOTHER ASKED, HAVEN'T YOU? CAN I AT LEAST DRIVE YOU HOME? I'VE CALLED A TAXI IT'S TAKEN CARE OF. PLEASE. WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU EXPECTING FROM ME, DARWYN? ONE TRIP TO SEE ME IN THE HOSPITAL AND MAGICALLY, WE'RE OK? YOU KNOW... I SAW SOMETHING ON THE TUBE LAST NIGHT MADE ME THINK OF YOU. THE HISTORY CHANNEL WAS SHOWING THIS OLD NEWSREEL FOOTAGE FROM ABOUT 1913 BEFORE WORLD WAR I. JUST PEOPLE, REGULAR FOLKS IN ENGLAND, WALKING BY, LOOKING IN THE CAMERA. YOU THINK EVEN ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE HAD ANY IDEA WHAT WAS GONNA HAPPEN TO THEIR WORLD? WHEN THEY SHOT THAT FILM, THE BRITISH EMPIRE WAS THE WORLD'S ONLY SUPERPOWER. THEY WON THE WAR IN EUROPE BUT LOST THE WORLD. THE RESULTS OF THAT WAR LED TO NATIONAL LIBERATION MOVEMENTS ALL ACROSS AFRICA, ASIA, THE MIDDLE EAST. DO YOU THINK ANY ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE IN THAT NEWSREEL FOOTAGE THOUGHT THERE WAS A CHANCE IN HELL THE BRITISH EMPIRE WOULD BECOME NOTHING BUT A MEMORY INSIDE THEIR OWN LIFETIMES? YOU THINK ABOUT THAT, DARWYN. THE NEXT TIME YOU GET YOUR MARCHING ORDERS... FROM GOOD OLD UNCLE SAM. Judy: NO, MARCUS! WE'RE DONE WITH THE TRUCK. YOU ARE GOING TO BE COLORING NOW. [GROWLS] EXCUSE ME? DID YOU JUST GROWL AT GRANDMA? DON'T TAKE IT PERSONALLY. IT'S JUST SOMETHING NEW HE'S DOING. HOW LONG HAS THIS BEEN GOING ON? UH...A FEW WEEKS. THINGS HAVE BEEN A LITTLE TOUGH LATELY. IT'S HIS WAY OF BLOWING OFF STEAM. [GROWLS] MARCUS! STOP IT. THAT SOUNDS LIKE THINGS HAVE BEEN MORE THAN JUST A LITTLE TOUGH. I TRY MY BEST, YOU KNOW. BUT IT'S JUST... THINGS AREN'T EASY. SINGLE MOM, COLLEGE DROP-OUT, BAD AFFAIR WITH A BLACK EX-CON, HOW CAN YOU EXPECT IT TO BE? WHAT? THE POINT IS RON AND I WANNA HELP EASE THE BURDEN. WAIT...I'M SORRY. HOW THE HELL DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT? WE HIRED A PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR. MARCUS, CAN YOU GO TO YOUR ROOM? BUT I'M COLORING. PLEASE. MOMMY NEEDS TO TALK TO GRANDMA IN PRIVATE, OK? FOR A MINUTE. AND YOU CAN TAKE YOUR TRUCK. [* PIANO INCIDENTAL] YOU WANNA HELP EASE THE BURDEN? WHAT DOES THAT MEAN EXACTLY? IT MEANS MY LAWYER SAYS WE COULD PROBABLY WIN IF WE PETITION THE COURT FOR CUSTODY OF MARCUS. HE SAYS YOUR INFIDELITY GIVES US A LOT OF LEVERAGE REGARDING HOW FIT YOU ARE TO BE A MOTHER. HOW FIT I AM?! ARE YOU KIDDING ME? THE ONLY REASON WHY IT'S INFIDELITY, JUDY, IS BECAUSE YOUR SON REFUSES TO SIGN THE DIVORCE PAPERS! IT'S NOT MY CHOICE. NO! YOUR CHOICE IS TO ABANDON PEOPLE WHEN THINGS GET TOUGH. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN MARCUS MAKES A MISTAKE WHEN HE'S OLDER? YOU'LL THROW HIM AWAY TOO? JUDY, YOUR SON WAS A MEAN AND A RECKLESS DRUNK AND A DRUG ADDICT. I DIDN'T LEAVE HIM. HE PUT HIMSELF AWAY WHEN HE CRASHED INTO THAT FAMILY. WHAT'S YOUR LAWYER GONNA SAY ABOUT THAT, HUH? I GUESS WE'LL SEE. I THOUGHT MAYBE WE COULD HANDLE THIS CIVILLY BUT I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN IT WAS BEYOND TRASH LIKE YOU. I MAY DIE BEFORE I SEE MY SON A FREE MAN AGAIN BUT I'M DAMN SURE GONNA LIVE TO SEE HIS SON GET THE LIFE THAT HE DESERVES. [RAPID BEEPING AND CRACKLING] [RAPID BEEPING] SO? NO RADIOACTIVE PENETRATION FROM THE AM 241. I TOLD YOU I HAD EXCEPTIONAL SKILLS. EXCELLENT. SOUNDS LIKE WE'RE READY TO PICK UP THE SHIPMENT, RIGHT? THE TRUTH? WE SHIELDED WHAT WE PUT IN THERE TODAY. BUT NOTHING'S GONNA COMPARE TO THE REAL THING. MR. ROSSMAN. DID YOU FORGET SOMETHING? NO. I...UH... I HAD TO LEAVE WORK EARLY. I WAS TOO PREOCCUPIED. ANYBODY ELSE HERE? MRS. ROSSMAN HAS JUST BEEN IN AND THE KIDS ARE AT DAY CAMP. THOSE PICTURES YOU SAW, THEY'RE JUST... FANTASY. YOU KNOW THAT, DON'T YOU? I UNDERSTAND. THERE ISN'T A RED BLOODED MALE ON THE PLANET DOESN'T HAVE A DRAWER LIKE THAT. MR. ROSSMAN, IT'S FINE. I'M SORRY I WENT INTO A PRIVATE AREA WITHOUT PERMISSION. IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN. GOOD, GOOD. [SIGHING] I WAS WORRIED ALL MORNING I'D HAVE TO TALK TO YOUR AGENCY AND THEN I REMEMBERED THAT YOUR VISA'S ABOUT TO EXPIRE. AND ALL THE "HE SAID SHE SAID" WOULD ONLY END UP IN YOUR BEING DEPORTED AND I DON'T WANT THAT. NO, NEITHER DO I. I WASN'T GONNA SAY ANYTHING. I LIKE WORKING HERE. [LAUGHS] WE SHOULD FORGET IT HAPPENED. FORGET THAT IT HAPPENED? EVERY TIME I SEE YOU I'LL KNOW YOU THINK I'M SOME KIND OF PERVERT. I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR FOR ME TO BE THAT UNCOMFORTABLE IN MY OWN HOUSE. MAYBE YOU SHOULD GO. I...I DON'T THINK YOU'RE A PERVERT. DID THE PICTURES... EXCITE YOU? YOUR WIFE IS GONNA BE HOME VERY SOON. I'D HATE FOR HER TO WALK IN ON THIS MESS. RIGHT, RIGHT. MY WIFE. SHE IS VERY PARTICULAR. AND YOU KNOW THE WAY I CAUGHT YOU RUMMAGING AROUND WHERE YOU DON'T BELONG I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF WE FOUND SOMETHING WAS MISSING. LIKE THOSE DIAMOND EARRINGS OF HERS THAT YOU LIKE SO MUCH. SHE CAN HAVE A VERY ITCHY TRIGGER FINGER WHEN IT COMES TO CALLING THE COPS. I DON'T WANT ANY TROUBLE. [WHISPERS] THEN TELL ME THE TRUTH. TELL ME HOW THE PICTURES EXCITED YOU. THE PICTURES EXCITED ME. [SIGHS] THAT'S ALL I WANTED TO HEAR. TAKE OFF YOUR SHIRT. THERE'S GOTTA BE SOMETHING YOU CAN DO. THE FBI DOESN'T GET INVOLVED IN CIVILIAN CUSTODY BATTLES. IT ISN'T OUR FUNCTION. YOU OWE ME! I...I SIGNED YOUR FUCKING NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT! OK. I TOLD YOU STUFF ABOUT MINA, SHE CAME TO MY WORK FOR CHRIST'S SAKES. AND I APPRECIATE HOW YOU'VE COOPERATED BUT IT'S JUST NOT HOW WE USE OUR RESOURCES. AND WHAT YOU NEED IS A GOOD LAWYER. [SCOFFING] I CAN'T AFFORD A GOOD LAWYER. I'M LIVING FROM PAY CHECK TO PAY CHECK. PLEASE? I CANNOT LOSE MARCUS. I CAN'T HELP YOU. I'M SORRY. WAIT! WHAT IF I GIVE YOU WHAT YOU WANT? IF I...UM.... WATCH DARWYN FOR YOU? YOU KNOW... ASK HIM QUESTIONS. WHAT IF I... SPIED ON HIM FOR YOU? LIKE YOU ASKED? WOULD YOU MAKE HER STOP THEN? SEE, THE CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE CHANGED. THAT'S NO LONGER AN ISSUE FOR US. LOOK. IF YOU MAKE THIS CUSTODY THING GO AWAY FOR GOOD I'LL TELL YOU DARWYN'S SECRETS. WHATEVER YOU NEED. I'M AFRAID THAT SHIP HAS SAILED. I'M SORRY. *** [MOANING] [PANTING] COME ON. COME ON. [PANTING] COME ON. COME ON. COME ON. COME ON. COME ON. [WOMAN SINGING] [GROANING] PHEW! [SCOFFING] MY WIFE, SHE LOOKS GOOD, BUT SHE MIGHT AS WELL BE SLEEPING WHEN WE MAKE LOVE. TELL YOU THE TRUTH, I HAVE MORE FUN JERKING OFF THAN FUCKING HER. [LAUGHS] BUT WHEN SHE GOES TO PALM SPRINGS THAT WON'T BE A PROBLEM. WE'LL HAVE LOTS OF TIME TO ENJOY OURSELVES. THEN I GET TO SEE WHAT OTHER TRICKS YOU GOT. [DOG BARKING] [KIDS SHOUTING] [MAN SHOUTING] [DOOR BELL RINGING] THE HOUSE LOOKS GOOD. YOU'VE DONE A... GOOD JOB KEEPING IT UP. WE HAD SOME GOOD TIMES IN THIS HOUSE... WHAT ARE THOSE? THEY... I SPOKE TO YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT YOUR DIET, THIS IS STUFF YOU SHOULD BE EATING. HOW MUCH DO I OWE YOU? POP, QUIT IT, PLEASE. I'M JUST TRYING... I SAID, HOW MUCH DO I OWE YOU? YOU'RE MY FATHER, AND I'M TRYING TO HELP. WHY DO YOU HAVE TO BE LIKE THIS? BECAUSE YOU BETRAYED ME, DARWYN! EVERYTHING I BELIEVED, EVERYTHING I'M ABOUT! AND I'M NOT GONNA FORGIVE YOU FOR IT JUST BECAUSE YOU BUY ME SOME SUGAR-FREE GROCERIES. [SIGHING] OH, OK. SO YOU MAKE ALL THESE GRAND SPEECHES ABOUT THE BLACK MAN BEING VICTIMIZED AND YOU'VE WASTED THE LAST TWENTY YEARS PLAYING THE VICTIM! I'M SORRY, POP! I'M SORRY... IF I CHOSE MOM WHEN YOU TWO GOT DIVORCED, BUT MY WHOLE LIFE CANNOT BE ABOUT THAT MOMENT. I WAS TEN FUCKING YEARS OLD! I WAS JUST A GODDAMN KID! DON'T YOU DARE CURSE IN MY HOUSE! IT WASN'T ABOUT THAT MOMENT. IT'S ABOUT EVERYTHING SINCE. THE ARMY. THE FBI. I CHOSE THE ARMY BECAUSE OF YOU! I DIDN'T HAVE A CHOICE! YOU GOT A BOSS, DARWYN, A SUPERVISOR? WHAT COLOR IS HE, HUH? PRETTY PALE, I BET. HOW MANY BLACK AGENTS THEY EVEN GOT IN THE FBI? [GROWLING] COME ON. BE HONEST. YOUR GOVERNMENT'S WAR ON TERROR STRATEGY IS A JOKE ANYWAY! IT'S NOT MY STRATEGY, POP... BUT IT IS MY WAR. AND I'M NOT JUST GONNA AVOID IT. IF I DID I WOULDN'T... I WOULDN'T BE YOUR SON. LOOK AT ME, POP. LOOK AT ME! MY, UH...MY POSTURE WHEN I WALK INTO A ROOM. HEAD UP, SHOULDERS BACK, THAT'S FROM... THAT'S FROM WATCHING YOU. MY LOVE OF HISTORY AND READING CAME FROM SITTING IN THAT LIVING ROOM RIGHT OVER THERE. YOU READING TO ME UNTIL I COULD READ TO MYSELF! [SIGHING] GOD, WE LOST... WE LOST TWENTY YEARS. HOW MANY MORE HAVE WE GOT LEFT? *** [SIGHING] IF GOD COULD SEE YOUR FACE RIGHT NOW, HE'D FORGIVE YOU ANYTHING. NO, HE ONLY FORGIVES YOU COMPLETELY IF YOU DO SOMETHING LIKE TAKE IN ORPHANS OR MARTYR YOURSELF IN BATTLE. WELL, THAT SETTLES IT. TOMORROW, WE'LL FIND YOU AN ORPHAN TO TAKE IN. [SCOFFS] DARWYN, THE SHIPMENT? DOES IT MEAN OUR DATE IS SET NOW? WHAT? OUR DATE OF MARTYRDOM. THIS WILL BE OVER SOON, YEAH? EVEN IF I HAD THAT INFORMATION, YOU KNOW I COULDN'T TELL YOU. RIGHT, I'M SORRY. I...I WAS OUT OF LINE TO ASK. IT'S JUST THAT SUMAYA, THE FIRST MARTYR WHEN ABU JAHL WAS TORTURING HER, THE PROPHET, PEACE BE UPON HIM, CAME TO HER AND SAID, "BE PATIENT "FOR YOU HAVE A DATE SET TO ENTER PARADISE." AND AFTER THAT... NO MATTER HOW HARD THEY BEAT HER, HOW MUCH SHE SUFFERED, SHE NEVER BROKE. AND EVEN WHEN ABU JAHL DROVE HIS SPEAR INTO HER, SHE COULD FOCUS ON THAT DATE AND THE REST WAS MEANINGLESS. WHAT'S GOING ON? DID SOMETHING HAPPEN? IT'S ONLY FOR GOD TO KNOW. Darwyn: NO. NO, IT'S FOR ME TO KNOW. WE ARE AT WAR, MINA. YOU DON'T GET THE LUXURY OF KEEPING SECRETS FROM ME. IF I HAVE A SOLDIER AND SHE'S NOT READY IF SHE'S NOT STRONG THEN I AM... I AM STRONG! I'M A GOOD SOLDIER! THAT'S WHY I GO WITHOUT MY HIJAB AND RUB SHOULDERS WITH MEN. IT'S WHY WHEN MY BOSS SAYS HE'LL HAVE ME DEPORTED IF I DON'T DO WHAT HE WANTS I DO IT. MINA? WHAT DID HE MAKE YOU DO? [SIGHING] IT'S FUNNY, YOU KNOW. BEFORE I REVERTED, IT WAS MY JOB. I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW MANY MEN. I DID IT EVERY DAY, FOR MONEY, DRUGS, I DIDN'T CARE. I AM A MUSLIM WOMAN NOW. I'M A WIFE. I SHOULD HAVE TAKEN A KNIFE AND DRIVEN IT INTO HIS INFIDEL HEART BUT I DID NOT! BECAUSE I'M A GOOD SOLDIER. HE FORCED YOU TO HAVE SEX WITH HIM? [SIGHING] YOU WON'T GO BACK. YOU'LL QUIT YOUR JOB AND STAY HERE. NO, NO, HE... HE COULD REPORT ME, MAKE UP A STORY, HAVE ME ARRESTED, NO. I HAVE TO PROTECT THE MISSION, I HAVE TO... MINA, MINA. WHEN THE...WHEN THE ANGELS TAKE THE SOULS OF THOSE WHO DIE IN SIN, THEY ASK, "IN WHAT STATE WERE YOU?" AND THE SOULS REPLY "WE WERE WEAK "AND OPPRESSED IN THE LAND." AND THEN THE ANGELS SAY, "WAS GOD'S EARTH NOT SPACIOUS ENOUGH "FOR YOU TO GO SOMEWHERE ELSE?" THIS IS WHAT THE HOLY KORAN SAYS, THERE IS NO EXCUSE. THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR BEING SOME PLACE WHERE PEOPLE ARE DOING EVIL TO YOU. IF YOU'RE ABLE TO LEAVE IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY, AS A MUSLIM, TO DO SO. DID SUMAYA LEAVE? [MOUTHS] NO. NO, SHE DIDN'T. THANK YOU... DARWYN... FOR WANTING TO PROTECT ME. BUT I HAVE TO GO BACK. WE'RE HERE. ALMOST HOME. YOU KNOW, FIRST THING I'M GONNA DO WHEN I COME TO SARAJEVO, I'M GONNA GO SEE A FOOTBALL GAME. YOU LIKE FK SARAJEVO? I HAVEN'T BEEN TO A GAME IN A LONG TIME. AH, WE GO TOGETHER, BUDDY. I'LL TAKE YOU TO ASIM FERHATOVIC HASE STADIUM, WE WILL SIT, DRINK VERY, VERY MUCH AND SING HASE'S SONG FOR OUR TEAM. IT COME BACK TO YOU JUST LIKE WHEN YOU RIDE A BIKE. [SINGING IN BOSNIAN] [SINGING IN BOSNIAN] [BOTH SINGING IN BOSNIAN] HA, HA! [SINGING IN BOSNIAN] [SINGING IN BOSNIAN] [SINGING IN BOSNIAN] [LAUGHING] READY TO GO? WHY DO I HAVE TO WEAR THESE CLOTHES? I LIKE MY OLD CLOTHES. [SIGHING] WELL YOU CAN WEAR YOUR OLD CLOTHES WHEN YOU'RE ALONE WITH FAMILY BUT FROM NOW ON THIS IS HOW YOU'LL DRESS WHEN YOU'RE IN PUBLIC. I BOUGHT YOU SOMETHING. THE HOLY KORAN. YOU MUST KEEP IT IN A PLACE OF RESPECT AND... NEVER PUT ANOTHER BOOK ON TOP OF IT. AND ONLY READ IT AFTER YOUR ABLUTION, YEAH? THANK YOU. YOU BETTER PUT IT IN YOUR CASE FOR SAFE KEEPING. DID YOU DRAW THESE? OF COURSE, DADDY. IT'S YOU, RIDING YOUR HORSE. I WANT YOU TO COME WITH ME. SIT DOWN. ASMA, YOU'VE BEEN VERY GOOD, VERY BRAVE. AND I HAVE ONE LAST THING TO ASK OF YOU. I WANT YOU TO PROMISE ME NEVER TO DO SUCH DRAWINGS AGAIN. WHY? DON'T YOU LIKE THEM? HOW MUCH DO YOU LOVE YOUR FATHER? MORE THAN ANYTHING. NO. NO, YOU MUSTN'T LOVE ANYTHING MORE THAN ALLAH. [SPEAKS IN ARABIC] THERE IS NO GOD BUT GOD. THESE DRAWINGS, THEY DISTRACT YOU FROM THAT TRUTH. TO LOOK AT THEM IS TO WORSHIP A FALSE GOD. ISLAM FORBIDS IT. WE LIVE ON THIS EARTH TO SERVE ALLAH. THERE'S NO ONE GREATER, NOT ME, NOT YOUR MOTHER, NO ONE. [SPEAKING IN ARABIC] DO YOU UNDERSTAND? YES. GOOD. NOW I WANT YOU TO TAKE THEM AND THROW THEM IN THE FIRE. GO ON. I'M SORRY, DADDY, I THOUGHT YOU'D LIKE THEM. I PROMISE I WON'T DO IT AGAIN. ASMA, ALLAH EXPECTS YOU TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR PRAYERS, TO KNOW HOW TO BE A GOOD MUSLIM. YOU WANNA BE A TRUE BELIEVER LIKE ME, DON'T YOU? YES. THEN SHOW ALLAH YOUR LOYALTY AND THROW THE DRAWINGS INTO THE FIRE. IF YOU DON'T DO THIS, YOU'RE TELLING ALLAH THAT YOU'RE A MUSHRIK THAT YOU'RE A KAFIR THAT YOU WOULD RATHER SPEND ETERNITY IN HELL THAN JOIN YOUR PARENTS IN PARADISE. WELL IF YOU WON'T BURN THEM THEN YOU MIGHT AS WELL BURN THIS. NO! THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ALLAH! [WHIMPERING] NO. ALLAH WILL NEVER FORGET THIS. AND NEITHER WILL I. [SOBBING] HERE. WHAT'S THIS, THEN? FORGED UNION CARDS, WE'RE GONNA NEED 'EM TO GET INTO WHERE WE'RE GOING. UNITED JIHADIS OF AMERICA. I'M UNIONIZED, BRO. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS? ONLY PERSON WHO CAN FIRE MY ASS IS BIN LADEN. [MUMBLES] YOU STILL GOT A FAVOR LEFT WITH THE MARAVILLA? YEAH, MAYBE. WHY, WHAT'S UP? I NEED SOMETHING. IT'S...IT'S FOR MINA. *** OK, LET'S STAY SHARP, PEOPLE. IT'S ALMOST OVER. Radio: AGENT RUSSELL, THE SUBJECTS ARE ENTERING THE PORT FACILITY NOW. Agent: GHOST TEAMS ARE IN PLACE.

[SNIFFING] [CLEARING HIS THROAT] [SIGHS] OK, WE NEED TO TURN A BAD SITUATION INTO A GOOD ONE. WE NEED TO START GATHERING EVIDENCE SO WE CAN IDENTIFY THAT UNIDENTIFIED MALE, THE ONE THAT JUST GOT OFF THAT SHIP. I NEED THE COASTGUARD TO DO A ROUTINE BOARDING OF THE VESSEL, I WANT A PHOTOGRAPH OF EVERY CREW MEMBER. I WANT A COPY OF THE SHIP'S MANIFEST. WE NEED TO IDENTIFY EVERY PRIOR PORT VISITED.
