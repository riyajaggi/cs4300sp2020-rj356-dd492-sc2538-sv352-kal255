 HE TRIED TO SELL US A FUCKING PAPERWEIGHT! WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME THE BATTERY UNITS WERE MESSED WITH? ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND? WE'RE NOT GONNA GIVE 'EM A WORKING SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILE, YOU KNOW THAT. THE YMCA IN HOPE STREET, DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES, LOCKER 67. THIS IS FARIK'S SAFE HOUSE. I WANT FORENSICS TO GET EVERYTHING. SAFE HOUSE WASN'T SO SAFE, HUH? PICK HIM UP, GET HIM OUT OF HERE. [YELLING] I THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE QUICK THIS TIME BUT--BUT IT'S NOT. *** *** NOT BAD. WE'VE CLONED THE NEW AUTHENTICATOR BUT THE URL IS NO LONGER WORKING. SORRY. DIGITAL FORENSICS TEAM IS TRYING TO TRACK THE HOME SERVER BUT IT'S PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE SO FAR BOTH OF THOSE WEBSITES HAVE SHUT DOWN IMMEDIATELY AFTER YOU'VE ACCESSED THEM. MY GIRLFRIEND SAID YOU DROPPED BY. RAILROADED HER INTO SIGNING AN NDA, THREATENING CRIMINAL PENALTIES. NOW SHE'S SCARED OUT OF HER MIND. GOOD. SHE SHOULD BE. SHE'S A CIVILIAN, DARWYN. YOU PULLED HER INTO THIS WORLD. NOW SHE NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND THE CONSEQUENCES. YOU WENT BEHIND MY BACK, MAN. [SIGHS] YOU SHOULD'VE JUST ASKED ME TO BRING HER IN. YOU COULD'VE GIVEN IT TO ME AND I COULD'VE GIVEN IT TO HER TO SIGN. WHY? YOU'VE GOT ENOUGH TO WORRY ABOUT, OK? Russell: BACKGROUND INFO ON YOUR NEW PLAYMATES. CHARMING GROUP OF DAMAGED HUMANS. WILHELMINA VAN DER HULST. AND THAT IS A HEALTH CERTIFICATE FOR LEGALIZED PROSTITUTION IN AMSTERDAM. SHE WAS A HOOKER. MM-HM. WELL, A PRIVATE CLUB ESCORT. YEAH, THAT'S THE FANCY KIND. Russell: BENITO VELAZQUEZ. NOW, YOU ASK ME, THE JIHAD IS JUST ANOTHER GAME FOR OLD BENNY. PRETTY SLIM STUFF ON SALIM HERE. YEAH. WELL, PARENTS WERE BAGHDADI PHYSICIANS WHO EMIGRATED TO LONDON DURING THE WORST OF THE IRAN-IRAQ WAR. BUT MI5 IS STILL INVESTING SHOE LEATHER TO GET A BETTER HANDLE ON HIS PATH TO RADICALISM. DO WE HAVE REMOTE AUDIO AND VIDEO SET UP IN THE HOSPITAL YET? TECHS ARE ON IT RIGHT NOW. GOOD. [BIRDSONG] [POLICE RADIO] THIS WAY, MA'AM. MOVE FORWARD, PLEASE. HI. I.D., PLEASE. WHAT'S THE PURPOSE OF YOUR VISIT? I'M HOOKING UP WITH MY FIANEE IN VANCOUVER. GONNA MEET HIS PARENTS FOR THE FIRST TIME. GOOD LUCK. THANK YOU. [ENGINE STARTS] Woman: HEY, MARTIN. HI, BUDDY. HOW ARE YA? Man: ALL RIGHT, ALEX, DON'T FORGET! BABY, WAIT FOR YOUR MOMMY. OK, I'M COMING. MM! SEE YOU LATER. BYE! BYE! *** [ENGINE STARTS] YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT IS RELEASING ONE OF THE MOST DANGEROUS TERRORISTS IN OUR CUSTODY. WE'RE NOT RELEASING ANYONE, SPECIAL AGENT SALEH. WE ARE SIMPLY TRANSFERRING CUSTODY OF THE DETAINEE TO A MORE APPROPRIATE FACILITY. SAAD BIN SAFWAN, A.K.A. FARIS AL-FARIK, WHO IS WANTED IN HIS HOMELAND FOR MULTIPLE CRIMINAL ACTS INCLUDING HOMICIDE AND TREASON. WE ARE EXTRADITING HIM AT THE REQUEST OF HIS GOVERNMENT. Saleh: SO WHAT DID THEY PROMISE IN RETURN? INCREASED COOPERATION ON THE GLOBAL WAR ON TERROR? OIL AT $70 PER BARREL FOR ONE MONTH THIS SUMMER? YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THIS KIND OF MOVE DOES TO MORALE ON THE FRONT LINES OF THE REAL WAR ON TERROR, THE ONE WE'RE OUT THERE FIGHTING 24/7. DON'T LECTURE ME ABOUT THE FRONT LINES, I STARTED MY GOVERNMENT CAREER AS AN OPERATIONS OFFICER AT CIA. I ONLY AGREED TO THIS MEETING AS A COURTESY. BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS, WE WOULDN'T HAVE SAAD BIN SAFWAN TO EXTRADITE TO THE SAUDIS IF IT WEREN'T FOR YOU PEOPLE, SO I FIGURED WE OWED YOU THAT, BUT YOU HAVE NO DOG IN THIS FIGHT. THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HAS NO JURISDICTION OVER THE DETAINEE AND LAST I HEARD, FBI HAS NO JURISDICTION OVER ANY PRISONERS OF ANY KIND. THIS IS A MATTER OF NATIONAL SECURITY, PLAIN AND SIMPLE. DOD AND CIA HAVE USED ALL LAWFUL INTERROGATION TACTICS, AND A FEW HIGHLY QUESTIONABLE ONES AS WELL. BUT THIS SON OF A BITCH IS LIKE THE ROCK OF GIBRALTAR-- IMMOVABLE. SO WHAT'S YOUR PLAN? KEEP HIM INCARCERATED FOR 40 YEARS? IT'S TIME TO THROW THE RULEBOOK AWAY AND GET HIM TO TALK. SO YOU'RE SENDING HIM TO THE SAUDIS TO BE TORTURED. YOUR WORD, NOT MINE. *** [INSECTS CALLING] [TWIG SNAPS] HELLO? ILIJA? ILIJA? ILIJA? OOH! [LAUGHS] [SIGHS] YOU SCARED THE HELL OUT OF ME. [GRUNTS] [HE LAUGHS] [BOTH LAUGH] WE DID IT. VANCOUVER HERE WE COME. AH. [ENGINE STARTS] FUCK YOU, EVIL EMPIRE. FUCK YOU, USA. Ilija: MMMMM! *** Man: WHOO! ...YOU KNOW? HERE YOU GO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MM-HM. OK, WHAT DO YOU GOT? THE NETWORK HAS ORDERED ME TO SECURE 100 POUNDS OF RDX. IT'S AN EXPLOSIVE THAT-- NO, I KNOW WHAT IT IS. IT'S JUST ABOUT THE MOST POWERFUL MILITARY EXPLOSIVE WE HAVE IN OUR ARSENAL. YOU PACK ENOUGH OF THAT SHIT TOGETHER, THE SHOCKWAVE ALONE WILL BRING DOWN A BUILDING. YEAH. WELL, IT'S NEXT ON THE AL-QAEDA SHOPPING LIST AND I NEED YOU TO GET IT FOR ME. [LAUGHS] AND DON'T FUCK AROUND WITH IT LIKE YOU DID WITH THE MISSILE, IT'S GOTTA BE PURE, UNADULTERATED, OTHERWISE IT'LL BLOW MY COVER. WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, LISTEN. WE CANNOT PERMIT A TERRORIST GROUP TO ACQUIRE EXPLOSIVES OF THAT MAGNITUDE. DARWYN, WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS. IF WE PLAY THIS OUT A LITTLE BIT LONGER, WE CAN FOLLOW THE TRAIL ALL THE WAY UP THE CHAIN OF COMMAND AND POSSIBLY BREAK THIS NETWORK WIDE OPEN. OK, MAYBE I CAN SUPPLY SOME INERT EXPLOSIVES. NO. WE CAN'T FAKE THIS, MAN. OUR FEMALE SUBJECT IS AN EXPLOSIVES EXPERT, SHE CAN SEE THROUGH ANY BULLSHIT. NO. IT'S JUST TOO RISKY. TO THE CASE? OR YOUR CAREER? THE ANSWER IS NO. ARE WE CLEAR? CRYSTAL. *** Woman: THANK YOU. HOW CAN I HELP YOU, MY FRIEND? DO YOU HAVE AN ARABIC MAGAZINE CALLED JANATULLAH. EXCUSE ME? JANATULLAH. GOD'S PARADISE. I WAS TOLD I COULD FIND IT HERE. WHO ARE YOU? MY NAME IS ILIJA KORJENIC. I WAS TOLD TO COME TO YOU IF I NEEDED HELP. WHO WAS YOUR AMIR IN BOSNIA? HAMZA BIN ALI, BEFORE HE WAS KILLED BY THE SERBS. WHAT WAS HIS SON'S NAME? HE HAD NO SONS. HIS DAUGHTERS WERE NAMED ZAYNAB AND HANEEFA. WHERE DID YOU TAKE YOUR BAYAT TO THE JIHAD? AT THE RENDEZVOUS POINT IN ZENICA. HOW CAN I HELP YOU, MY BROTHER? I NEED NEW PAPERS AND A WAY OUT OF CANADA. OF COURSE. YOU'LL BE ON A PLANE BACK TO EUROPE TOMORROW. I WILL NEED SOME TIME TO GET MY AFFAIRS IN ORDER. YOU DO NOT HAVE THE LUXURY OF TIME, MY BROTHER. TIE UP ANY LOOSE ENDS AND BE BACK HERE TOMORROW NIGHT. I UNDERSTAND. I NEED A PHOTO FOR YOUR NEW PASSPORT. SMILE, BROTHER. AFTER ALL, YOU DON'T WANT TO LOOK LIKE A... TERRORIST, AH? *** YO, RELAX, MAN. WHAT YOU WORRIED ABOUT? FUCKIN' EVERYTHING. SO WHAT'S UP, BRO? [SIGHS] WE GOT ORDERS FROM THE BROTHERHOOD. WE HAVE TO SECURE RDX. THAT'S AN EXPLOSIVE, RIGHT? YEAH. MILITARY GRADE. BUT, UH, IT'S ALSO USED IN CONSTRUCTION WORK, URBAN DEMOLITIONS. LIKE THE EAST L.A. INTERCHANGE. THE CITY'S TEARING DOWN 3 SQUARE BLOCKS WITH NOTHING BUT BROWN PEOPLE JUST TO MAKE WAY FOR A NEW RAMP ONTO THE 10. THE MARAVILLA HAS GOT BOYS WORKING ALL OVER THAT SITE. HOW DO WE GET TO 'EM? *** IT'S NOT TOO LATE, YOU KNOW. YOU START GIVING ME SOME USEFUL INTEL AND I'LL TAKE YOU BACK TO THE STATES. HAJJAJ IS A REAL PROFESSIONAL. THEY SAY HE CAN TORTURE YOU TO WITHIN AN INCH OF YOUR LIFE AND NOT GO OVER THAT LINE. YOU WON'T DIE. BUT YOU'LL WISH YOU WERE DEAD. [ELECTRICITY HUMMING] [SPEAKING ARABIC] [REPEATS IN ARABIC] [SCREAMING] [ELECTRICITY BUZZING AND CRACKLING] [CHOKED SCREAMING] *** [CELL PHONE RINGING] HELLO? Man: OH, HELLO, SON. OH, BABA, LISTEN, I'M SORRY I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO CALL YOU BACK. Salim: LIFE HERE IS VERY HECTIC, VERY BUSY. YEAH, I CAN IMAGINE. BUT I'M NOT CALLING TO HEAR YOUR EXCUSES. WE HAVE GOOD NEWS. Father: WE FOUND SOMEONE. EXCUSE ME? Father: A GIRL. YOUR MOTHER AND I HAVE FOUND A GIRL FOR YOU. SHE'S A SWEET GIRL. SHE'S A MEDICAL STUDENT. HER NAME IS FARAH AL-ASKARI. SHE WAS RAISED IN AMERICA. HER FAMILY IS VERY PROMINENT IN BAGHDAD. AND THEY HAVE GOOD RELATIONS WITH THE NEW GOVERNMENT IN IRAQ. [LAUGHS] YOU MEAN THE NEW AMERICAN PUPPET REGIME. Father: NOW, NOW, I DON'T WANT TO TALK POLITICS. SHE IS A GOOD MUSLIM AND A MARRIAGE WILL BRING HONOR TO BOTH FAMILIES. BABA, LOOK, I'VE TOLD YOU A THOUSAND TIMES, I AM NOT READY FOR MARRIAGE RIGHT NOW. Father: NOT READY OR NOT WILLING? BABA, LISTEN. NO, NO. YOU LISTEN TO ME. Father: IT HAS BEEN DECIDED. YOU WILL MEET FARAH, AND IF THE TWO OF YOU GET ALONG, OUR FAMILIES WILL ARRANGE THE WEDDING. FINE. I'LL SEE HER IF IT MAKES YOU HAPPY. *** Darwyn: HOW COME YOU'RE SO SURE YOUR BOY'S GONNA COME THROUGH? I DROVE HIM ON HIS FIRST ASSIGNMENT FOR THE GANG. HE WAS SUPPOSED TO TAKE OUT THIS JOTO FROM MAIN STREET. FLACO TOOK HIS SHOT AND MISSED. SUDDENLY 3 MORE CABRONES ARE SHOOTING BACK. SO I RAN MY WHEELS INTO THOSE DUDES, TOOK OUT THE TARGET, GAVE FLACO THE CREDIT FOR THE KILL. HE OWES ME, MAN. HEY, BRENDA, DON'T GO TOO FAR. ELISA, PLAY TOO, ALL RIGHT? TAKE CARE OF YOUR SISTER, COME ON. HAVE FUN, GUYS. ELISA, GO WITH BRENDA, ALL RIGHT? Â¿QUE TAL?, FLACO. Â¿QUE TAL?, AMIGO. HOW YOU DOING, MAN? HOW YOU DOING, MAN? GOOD. THIS IS MY FRIEND DARWYN. DARWYN. I LIKE YOUR NAME, MAN. SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST, RIGHT? YOU MUSLIM LIKE BENNY? IS THAT A PROBLEM? NO, MAN. BENITO TELLS ME YOU GUYS LIKE JESUS TOO. WE'RE COOL. GLAD TO KNOW THAT. SO, WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU, HOMES? I NEED TO BORROW SOME OF YOUR CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT. BORROW? LIKE, WHAT KIND OF EQUIPMENT? RDX. RDX. I DON'T NEED AN ECHO, MAN. YOU HEARD ME. HOW MUCH WE TALKING ABOUT? 100 POUNDS. [OPENS CAN] YOU'RE CRAZY, MAN. YOU KNOW HOW MUCH SECURITY THEY GOT AROUND THAT SHIT? Benny: ON THE CONSTRUCTION SITE, YEAH. BUT NOT AROUND THE SECRET MARAVILLA STASH. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, MAN. WORD IS, HOMIES WORKING THE SITE HAVE BEEN SNEAKING OUT BITS AND PIECES OF RDX FOR THE PAST 18 MONTHS. MARAVILLA HAS GOT ENOUGH IN STORAGE TO BLOW UP AN ENTIRE BLOCK OF 8TH STREET HOMEBOYS IF THEY START ACTING UP. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE ASKING ME, MAN. I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I'M ASKING YOU. THE ONLY REASON YOU'RE STILL ALIVE IS COS I NEVER TOLD MARAVILLA HOW YOU FUCKED UP. YOU OWE ME YOUR LIFE, PUTO. *** [CARLI MOANING AND PANTING] OH, OH, OH. OH, OH. OH-- MM, MM. [HE GRUNTS] * ...BREATHE OUT SO I CAN BREATHE YOU IN * * LIKE THE HOT SUMMER DESERT WIND... * [CHUCKLES] THANK YOU. [LAUGHS] YOU'RE WELCOME. NO. I MEAN THANK YOU. NOT JUST FOR THAT BUT FOR EVERYTHING. FOR A VERY LONG TIME... I FELT NOTHING AT ALL. I WAS LIKE A DEAD MAN. YOU MADE ME FEEL ALIVE AGAIN. THAT'S A GREAT BOOK. IT SHATTERS A LOT OF STEREOTYPES ABOUT MUSLIM WOMEN. COOL. WELL, I'LL CHECK IT OUT. IT'S REALLY INSPIRING. FOR ME, THAT ONE... UM, WELL, SEALED THE DEAL. YOU--YOU'RE A MUSLIM? I REVERTED TO ISLAM 3 YEARS AGO. OH. YOU'RE SURPRISED. [LAUGHS] SORRY, I-- YOU JUST-- YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE, UM-- AN ARAB WOMAN IN A VEIL. YEAH. I GUESS I HAVE MY OWN STEREOTYPES, HUH? I'M GAYLE. MINA. PLEASURE. YEAH. HI. [CAMERA CLICKS] I ACTUALLY WAS GONNA GO DOWN THE BLOCK AND GET SOME COFFEE. DO YOU WANNA COME WITH, OR-- YEAH, I'D LIKE THAT. OK, GREAT. YOU BETTER PAY FOR THE BOOK. YEAH. DEFINITELY GONNA PAY FOR THIS BOOK. [WHIP CRACKS] AH! [WHIP CRACKS] AGGH! AGGH! [SCREAMING] [WHIP CRACKING] SO WHERE ARE YOU FROM ORIGINALLY? [CLICK] HOLLAND. A TOWN CALLED AMSTELVEEN. IT'S A LITTLE SOUTH OF AMSTERDAM. IT'S LIKE, HOW DO YOU SAY THAT? A SUBURB. UM... CAN I ASK YOU A PERSONAL QUESTION? GO AHEAD. WHY DID YOU BECOME A MUSLIM? I GREW UP IN A VERY LIBERAL FAMILY, WE HAD MONEY, CHOICES. THERE WERE NO RULES TO SPEAK OF. EVERYTHING WAS ALL RIGHT AS LONG AS IT FELT GOOD. SO, UH, WELL, I DID WHAT I WANTED. PARTIES, DRUGS, SEX. I HAD A GREAT TIME. BUT IT TOOK OVER MY LIFE. SO, UH, AFTER A WHILE I STARTED TO FEEL LOST. ONE DAY I MET A MUSLIM WOMAN. SHE WAS A TURK, AN IMMIGRANT, SHE WORKED IN A GROCERY STORE DOWN THE STREET. I USED TO FEEL SO SORRY FOR HER, WEARING THAT HEADSCARF. HOW COULD SHE BE SO BRAINWASHED? AND SO, KIND OF LIKE YOU, I STARTED ASKING QUESTIONS, AND TALKING TO HER. AND THEN I BEGAN TO REALIZE THAT MAYBE I WAS THE ONE WHO WAS BRAINWASHED. I MEAN, ALL THE SO-CALLED FREEDOM IN THE WEST DIDN'T BRING ME HAPPINESS. IT JUST MADE ME A SLAVE. A SLAVE TO FASHION, A SLAVE TO THE COSMETICS INDUSTRY, A SLAVE TO MEN. AND THEN I READ THE HOLY QUR'AN AND I SAW THAT ISLAM GAVE DIGNITY TO WOMEN. IN ISLAM I LEARNED THAT MY VALUE COMES FROM WHAT'S INSIDE, FROM MY HEART, MY SOUL. AND THAT'S WHEN I BECAME TRULY FREE. *** ASSALAMU ALAIKUM. HI, I'M FARAH. LIKE FARRAH FAWCETT. YOU MUST BE SALIM. CAN I GET DRINKS FOR YOU? UH-- A SPARKLING WATER, PLEASE. A VODKA MARTINI. HOLD THE OLIVE. PLEASE. YOU DRINK. UH, I KNOW, IT'S AGAINST THE RULES, BUT I JUST FINISHED THIS 12-HOUR SHIFT IN THE E.R. UP AT CEDARS. THIS GUY HAD A BICYCLE HANDLEBAR RAMMED UP HIS NOSE HALFWAY THROUGH HIS SKULL, SO... [LAUGHS] YEAH, TRUST ME, I NEED A DRINK. [CHUCKLES] WELL... UM... MY PARENTS TELL ME THAT YOU'RE WORKING HERE BUT YOU STUDIED OVERSEAS. YEAH, UM, I'M AN ELECTRICAL ENGINEER. OH. I RECEIVED MY DEGREE AT IMPERIAL COLLEGE IN LONDON. OH, I LOVE LONDON. HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO, UM-- OH, UH, VEERASWAMY ON REGENT STREET? THEIR CHICKEN CURRY IS AMAZING! I DON'T THINK THAT RESTAURANT IS HALAL. Waitress: OK, WE HAVE A VODKA MARTINI AND A SPARKLING WATER, SIR. THANKS. UH-- Woman: GAYLE. FBI. GET IN. GO. WHAT'S GOING ON? YOUR NEW FRIEND IS ONE OF THE TARGETS OF OUR INVESTIGATION. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. Russell: SOMEHOW SHE FOUND OUT ABOUT YOU. WHICH MEANS SHE'S SUSPICIOUS OF DARWYN. OH, MY GOD. NOW, THE NEXT TIME SHE CONTACTS YOU, WE'RE GONNA HAVE YOUR PHONES TAPPED. WE'LL BE LISTENING-- OH, NO, NO, NO. I AM NOT DOING THIS, OK? I'M GONNA TAKE MY SON, WE'RE GONNA LEAVE, WE'LL GO TO... FUCKING OMAHA, OK? WHERE MY SISTER LIVES NOW, AND--AND WE'LL-- NO. WE WON'T COME BACK UNTIL THIS IS OVER. IF YOU DISAPPEAR NOW, THAT'LL SEND UP A THOUSAND RED FLAGS. YOU MIGHT AS WELL SHOOT DARWYN YOURSELF. IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT. YOU'RE WORKING WITH US FROM HERE ON. *** I'M SORRY, I NEED TO KEEP AN EYE ON THE TIME. I'M JOINING SOME FRIENDS FOR THE FOOTBALL GAME TONIGHT. YOU MEAN SOCCER? BARCELONA VERSUS ARSENAL. [LAUGHS] I LOVE RONALDINHO. HE'S SUCH AN AWESOME PLAYER, HE'S-- WAIT, YOU FOLLOW FOOTBALL? I LOVE THE GAME. I'VE BEEN PLAYING SINCE FIRST GRADE, AND, UM, I EVEN MADE THE WOMEN'S VARSITY TEAM OVER AT DARTMOUTH. [BOTH LAUGH] I THINK YOU'RE THE FIRST GIRL IN AMERICA THAT I'VE MET THAT CARES ABOUT FOOTBALL. DO YOU STILL PLAY? NO, NOT ON A TEAM. BUT I MIGHT COACH A GIRLS' TEAM AT A MUSLIM YOUTH CAMP IN PASADENA THIS SUMMER. THEY HOST WOMEN'S FOOTBALL AT A MUSLIM YOUTH CAMP? THIS IS AMERICA, SALIM. I MEAN, ISLAM IS THRIVING BECAUSE WE'RE INTEGRATING. YOU KNOW? WE DON'T NEED TO CUT OURSELVES OFF FROM MAINSTREAM SOCIETY THE WAY MUSLIMS DO IN EUROPE. FIRST OF ALL, MUSLIMS DON'T CHOOSE TO BE SEPARATE IN EUROPE. WE'RE FORCED. AND YOU TALK AS IF THE AMERICAN WAY OF LIFE, WITH ITS HEDONISM AND MATERIALISM, IS ON EQUAL FOOTING WITH ISLAMIC VALUES. I MEAN, LOOK AROUND YOU, FARAH. TRUTH IS, AMERICANS ARE ON A SELF-DESTRUCTIVE PATH AND ISLAM IS THE ONLY THING THAT CAN SAVE THEM. DO YOU... REALLY BELIEVE THAT? COURSE I DO. THEN, UM... EXCUSE ME FOR ASKING, BUT WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE IN THE U.S.? IN L.A. OF ALL PLACES. I MEAN, TALK ABOUT HEDONISM AND MATERIALISM. THE TRUTH IS, I'M-- I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A BIT OF A MASOCHIST. [LAUGHS] SO STEER CLEAR FROM ME IF YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOOD FOR YOU. [LAUGHS] [BEEPING] Farah: IS EVERYTHING OK? YEAH. UM... THAT WAS JUST MY MATES CALLING. BLOODY HELL. I'M SORRY BUT I REALLY DO NEED TO GET GOING. NO, NO. YEAH. NOTICE I DIDN'T, UM, OFFER MY HAND. I DIDN'T WANT TO UPSET ANY OF YOUR DELICATE FUNDAMENTALIST SENSIBILITIES, SO-- ALL RIGHT. THAT SHOULD COVER IT. [LAUGHS] I HAVE A SURPRISE FOR YOU. IT'S CEVAPI. I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT ENJOY A LITTLE TASTE OF THE BALKANS. WHERE DID YOU GET THIS? I FOUND A BOSNIAN RESTAURANT IN VANCOUVER. THEY HAVE CEVAPI, BUREK, ALL YOUR FAVORITE DISHES FROM BACK HOME. IT'S A SIGN, ILIJA. WE WERE MEANT TO BE HERE. TOGETHER. [SIGHS] MMM. I'M SORRY. I HAVE TO. I HAVE TO. [CHOKING] I HAVE TO. I HAVE TO. [CHOKING] [GASPING] [GRUNTS] I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY. [SOBS] I'M SORRY. *** [SPEAKING ARABIC] HAJJAJ IS STERILIZING THE WIRE. HE WOULDN'T WANT YOU DYING FROM SOME NASTY INFECTION AFTER HE SHOVES IT UP YOUR URETHRA. BUT YOU'LL PROBABLY PASS OUT AFTER A FEW SECONDS. MOST PEOPLE DO. BUT EVERY TIME YOU URINATE, YOU'LL FEEL IT AGAIN. YOU'LL BE PISSING FIRE FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THIS WAY. YOU CAN END THIS ANY TIME YOU WANT. TAKE AWAY YOUR FUN? I WOULDN'T WANNA BORE YOU. YOU THINK I FUCKING ENJOY THIS? AMERICANS HATE THIS SHIT. IT'S NOT WHO WE ARE. BUT TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, I DON'T CARE BECAUSE YOU TOOK OFF THE FUCKING GLOVES. I DO THINGS I HATE MYSELF FOR, AND I BLAME YOU FOR THAT. ALL OF YOU. IF YOU WOULD JUST COOPERATE, I CAN GET HAJJAJ TO STOP. I--I UNDERSTAND HIM. WHAT? HAJJAJ. I UNDERSTAND HIM. HE DOES WHAT HE BELIEVES IS NECESSARY. BUT YOU AMERICANS ARE SO OBSESSED WITH YOURSELVES THAT YOU CARE MORE ABOUT ANALYZING YOUR GUILT THAN ACHIEVING VICTORY. THAT IS WHY WE WILL WIN AND YOU WILL LOSE. NICE SPEECH. I BET THE JAPANESE SAID SOMETHING LIKE THAT JUST BEFORE WE DROPPED THE BOMB AT HIROSHIMA. [SCREAMING] [SIZZLING] SO, WHAT'S GOING ON? Man: THAT'S WHAT I'D LIKE TO KNOW. WAS THIS MEETING ON THE BOOKS? NOT THAT I KNOW OF. I'LL TELL YOU IN A SECOND. [CLICK] [WHITE NOISE] WHAT THE HELL'S HE DOING NOW? I CAN'T HEAR A GODDAMN THING. CALL RUSSELL. [WHITE NOISE] COOL TOY. SOMETHING I PICKED UP FROM MY FORMER SHAYKH. WHAT, DO YOU THINK WE'RE BEING BUGGED? THESE DAYS YOU CAN NEVER BE TOO CAUTIOUS. SO WHY ARE WE HERE? THE ULA HAVE ORDERED US TO SECURE AN EXPLOSIVE CALLED RDX. THROUGH BENNY, WE'VE LOCATED A SECRET STASH BELONGING TO SOME OF HIS OLD FRIENDS, THE MARAVILLA. WE'RE GONNA TAKE IT. TONIGHT. DO YOU HAVE YOUR FIELD KIT WITH YOU TO DO AN ON-SITE TEST OF THE MATERIAL? SO WHAT'S IT FOR? EVEN IF I KNEW, I WOULDN'T TELL YOU. WHITE-NOISE GENERATOR? *** WELL, WHERE THE HELL'S HE GOING? NO, I DIDN'T AUTHORIZE ANY-- YOU FOLLOW HIM AND GET BACK TO ME! YOU UNDERSTAND? GET OVER IN THE LEFT LANE, THE FAST LANE. NOW PUT ON YOUR HAZARDS AND SLOW DOWN. JUST ABOVE 30. [CAR HORN BLARING] WHAT'S HAPPENING? I THINK WE'RE BEING FOLLOWED. [HORNS BLARING] Man: SHIT. WHAT'S HE DOING? I DON'T KNOW. [HORNS BLARING] GET IN HIS LANE. I CAN'T. IF I STAY BEHIND HIM AT THAT SPEED WE'LL GET MADE FOR SURE. WE LOST HIM. NO. HE LOST US. TURN OFF YOUR BLINKERS AND GO BACK TO NORMAL SPEED. I DON'T SEE ANYBODY. I PROBABLY JUST IMAGINED IT. SO FLACO TOLD ME THAT THE BANGER WHO PULLS GUARD DUTY TONIGHT IS A NOTORIOUS PARTY DOG, RICHIE THE PIG. HE'S ALWAYS SNEAKING OFF TO SOME CHICA'S PLACE TO DO BEER, WEED... HER. LEAVES THE EXPLOSIVES TILL THE MORNING. HE KNOWS HE'S NOT REALLY TAKING MUCH OF A RISK 'CAUSE NO ONE'S GOT THE BALLS TO RIP THE MARAVILLA OFF ON THEIR HOME TURF. NOBODY BUT US. YEAH. [CAR HORN BEEPS] *** [MUSIC PLAYING, FAINT] WAIT, GUYS, MUSIC. AND SOMETHING ELSE. KILL THE LIGHTS. Woman: OH, BABY! Salim: HEY, I THOUGHT YOU SAID THIS PLACE WOULD BE EMPTY. Benny: FLACO DIDN'T LIE, MAN. RICHIE THE PIG IS STILL PARTYING LIKE A FUCKING HOG HE JUST DIDN'T LEAVE HIS POST THIS TIME. *** [WOMAN MOANING] I THINK WE SHOULD BAIL, MAN. EVERY MARAVILLA KNOWS WHAT MY FACE LOOKS LIKE. FUCK THAT. LET'S JUST KILL HIM AND TAKE THE EXPLOSIVES, THAT'S ALL. NO. WE PILE UP TOO MANY BODIES, DRAW ATTENTION FROM THE COPS. MINA, YOU GOT YOUR HIJAB? YEAH, I DO. [WOMAN MOANS] LISTEN UP, ALL OF YOU. IF YOU CAN'T SPEAK SPANISH, DO NOT SPEAK AT ALL. [RICHIE AND WOMAN GRUNTING] [SPEAKING SPANISH] RICHIE! RICHIE!

I HAVE GOOD NEWS, ILIJA. I PREPARED ALL YOUR DOCUMENTS THIS MORNING BUT I JUST GOT AN EMAIL FROM THE ULAMA. THEY WANT YOU TO STAY IN VANCOUVER FOR THE TIME BEING. BUT YOU SAID I HAD TO LEAVE IMMEDIATELY, YOU SAID I HAD TO TIE UP LOOSE ENDS. PLANS CHANGE. THE BROTHERS HAVE DECIDED YOU'RE MORE VALUABLE RIGHT HERE. THEY HAVE SOMETHING NEW ON THE WAY IN LOS ANGELES AND THE NETWORK MAY NEED YOUR EXPERTISE. RELAX, MY FRIEND. HUH? YOU MAY BE IN VANCOUVER FOR SEVERAL MONTHS. MAYBE LONGER. GIVE ME MY FUCKING PLANE TICKET! [COUGHS] YOU'RE A STRONG MAN, SAAD. HAVE TO ADMIT, I'M IMPRESSED. BUT I WONDER... HOW MUCH OF THIS YOUR WIFE AND DAUGHTER WILL BE ABLE TO TAKE. HMM? [SIGHS] *** [SOBS] [ALARMS BLARING] *** YOU TOLD ME ONCE THAT THERE IS NO GOD, THAT WHAT I FOUGHT FOR WAS A LIE. NOW YOU'LL FIND THE TRUTH. [MEN SHOUTING IN DISTANCE, GUNFIRE] NO, NO. [COUGHING AND CHOKING] *** YOU GAVE THEM THE RDX? ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND? I CAN'T RISK DROPPING THE BALL WHEN WE ARE THIS CLOSE TO BREAKING THIS CASE. SINCE YOU WOULDN'T HELP ME, I HAD TO GO OFF THE GRID. DARWYN, NOW, I MAY NOT HAVE A TON OF FIELD EXPERIENCE, OK? BUT I KNOW ENOUGH TO SEE THAT YOU HAVE MADE SOME BAD FUCKING CHOICES HERE. NOW WHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING TO YOU? HUH? YOU. YOU ARE WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME, MAN. YOU'VE ONLY BEEN ON THIS CASE FOR A FEW WEEKS, YOU'RE ALREADY FUCKING THINGS UP. I CAN'T KEEP YOU IN THE LOOP. SO FAR, THE ONLY THING YOU'VE PROVEN TO BE GOOD AT IS GETTING PEOPLE KILLED, AND THAT SCARES THE SHIT OUT OF ME. IT'S BAD ENOUGH I GOTTA WORRY ABOUT THE BAD GUYS, I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT YOU TOO. HEY, LET'S CUT THE HORSESHIT. THIS ISN'T ABOUT ME OR ABOUT THE CHOICES THAT I HAVE TO MAKE TO EFFECTIVELY RUN THIS CASE. THIS IS ABOUT YOU AND YOUR MISGUIDED SYMPATHY FOR YOUR LITTLE MUSLIM BROTHERS OUT THERE THAT HAVE STARTED WAR WITH THIS COUNTRY. FUCK YOU. DON'T YOU EVEN FUCKING GO THERE WITH ME. DO YOU UNDERSTAND? IT IS MY LIFE THAT IS ON THE LINE EVERY FUCKING DAY. EVERY FUCKING DAY. DON'T YOU DARE QUESTION MY LOYALTY, EVER. I'M A MUSLIM. I AM A MUSLIM AND AN AMERICAN. AND WHAT I DO-- WHAT I DO EVERY DAY I DO FOR MY GOD AND MY COUNTRY. YOU TELL HOW GETTING THE FUCKING SOCIOPATHS ENOUGH RDX TO BLOW A MASSIVE HOLE IN DOWNTOWN L.A. SERVES YOUR GOD OR YOUR COUNTRY. RADIATION CONTAINMENT FACILITIES. WHAT? I DID A WALK-THROUGH OF A HOSPITAL THAT WE SECURED AND COMPARED IT TO THE SPECS OF THE OTHER TWO THAT THE BROTHERHOOD WANTED ME TO CHECK OUT. THEY ALL SHARE ONE THING IN COMMON-- RADIATION CONTAINMENT FACILITIES. THEY'RE PLANNING A NUCLEAR ATTACK. NOW YOU UNDERSTAND? WE HAVE TO FIND OUT WHERE THE NUKES ARE COMING FROM AND INTERCEPT THEM. AND I HAVE TO KEEP THE BROTHERHOOD HAPPY UNTIL THEY GIVE US A SHOT AT GRABBING THAT INFORMATION. WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST TELL ME? IT'S LIKE YOU SAID, MAN, I'M IN THE CENTER OF THIS SHIT STORM, SO I'M IN CONTROL OF THIS CASE. ALL RIGHT. WELL, THEN, SINCE YOU'RE SO IN CONTROL OF THE CASE, MAYBE YOU CAN TELL ME... WHY ONE OF YOUR CELL MEMBERS IS TAKING AN INORDINATE INTEREST IN YOUR PERSONAL LIFE. Tannoy: VANCOUVER AIRWAYS FLIGHT 1612 TO HUMBOLDT BEGIN BOARDING IN 5 MINUTES FROM GATE C12. Woman on TV: ...BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN RELEASED BY AL-QAEDA, CLAIMS TO SHOW A RAID ON A SAUDI ARABIAN DETENTION FACILITY OUTSIDE JEDDAH. SOURCES HAVE CONFIRMED THAT A GUN BATTLE BETWEEN MILITANTS AND SAUDI SECURITY FORCES DID TAKE PLACE EARLIER THIS WEEK AT A GOVERNMENT INSTALLATION IN THE COUNTRY'S WESTERN PROVINCE WHERE JEDDAH IS LOCATED. THE ATTACK WAS MEANT TO FREE SOME OF THE KINGDOM'S HIGHEST-PROFILE AL-QAEDA PRISONERS INCLUDING TERRORIST SAAD BIN SAFWAN, CAPTURED AND DETAINED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AFTER LEADING THE FAILED CHEMICAL ATTACK ON DODGER STADIUM IN LOS ANGELES LAST SUMMER. THE TAPE PRAISES BIN SAFWAN'S HEROISM BEFORE ANNOUNCING THAT HE WAS KILLED DURING THE RESCUE ATTEMPT. Woman on TV: BECAUSE OF HIS HIGH RANKING IN AL-QAEDA, BIN SAFWAN WAS CONSIDERED AN EXTREMELY VALUABLE SOURCE OF INFORMATION. CRITICS ARE CALLING HIS DEATH A SERIOUS SETBACK IN THE WAR ON TERROR. THE IDEA THAT A HIGH-PROFILE TERRORIST DETAINEE, BELIEVED TO BE IN U.S. CUSTODY... *** *** * THE SIGNS ABOVE MY HEAD ARE * CLEAR TO ALL * AN UNDERACHIEVER BUT A TRUE BELIEVER * * WHO NEVER HAD A HOPE IN HELL * I AM THE SOLIDER, I AM THE SOLIDER * * WHO FOUGHT A WAR FOR NOTHING * I AM THE DAMAGE THAT A DREAM DOES * * I AM THE DAMAGE THAT A DREAM DOES * * SING IT OUT, SING IT OUT, YOU'RE NOT ALONE * * YOU ARE NOT, YOU ARE NOT THE ONLY ONE * * YOU WERE LOST AND NOW YOU'RE FOUND * * SING IT OUT, SING IT OUT * SING IT OUT, SING IT OUT, YOU'RE NOT ALONE * * YOU ARE NOT, YOU ARE NOT THE ONLY ONE * * YOU WERE LOST AND NOW YOU'RE FOUND * * SING IT OUT, SING IT OUT * SING IT OUT, SING IT OUT, YOU'RE NOT ALONE * * YOU ARE NOT, YOU ARE NOT THE ONLY ONE * * YOU WERE LOST AND NOW YOU'RE FOUND * * SING IT OUT, SING IT OUT...
