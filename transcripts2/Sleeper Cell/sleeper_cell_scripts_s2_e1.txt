 *** Man: ARRRGH! YOU ARE FUCKED, SIR. *** CARLY, I WAS WONDERING IF YOU MIGHT KNOW A PLACE THAT I COULD STAY, JUST FOR A LITTLE WHILE. I HAVE WON A BATTLE. THE WAR WILL GO ON. *** [CALL TO PRAYER] [BUZZER] I HAVEN'T FINISHED MY PRAYERS YET! YOU FUCKING INFIDELS! I HAVEN'T FINISHED MY PRAYER YET! I HAVEN'T FINISHED MY PRAYER YET! I GOT A CALL THIS MORNING, WHILE YOU WERE IN THE SHOWER. THE BUREAU'S OFFERING ME A TEACHING JOB, QUANTICO. FBI ACADEMY? THEY WANT ME TO TEACH COUNTER-TERRORISM, UNDERCOVER TECHNIQUES, RELATE MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE, THAT SORT OF THING. HEY MARCUS, DON'T GO OUT TOO FAR. OKAY. WELL, THAT'S GREAT. I MEAN, THAT'S--LIKE A NORMAL JOB. REGULAR HOURS, BORING. SAFE. WHAT DID YOU TELL THEM? I DIDN'T. NOT--NOT YET, I DIDN'T. I JUST SAID I'D THINK ABOUT IT. WANNA KNOW WHAT I THINK? I THINK IT'S PERFECT. WE GO SOMEWHERE NEW, START OUT FRESH. YEAH. BESIDES, YOU'D MAKE A GREAT TEACHER. *** Man: WOW! LOOK AT THAT BIRD! [SIREN] [KNOCKING] *** [KNOCKING] *** Man: HELLO? ANYBODY HOME? *** [GULLS CRYING] [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] YOU WANT SOME COFFEE? NO, I'M...I'M GOOD. I'M GOOD. [SIGHING] HOW'S DECOMPRESSION TREATING YOU? IT'S GOOD. IT'S GOOD. [SIGHING] ANY NEWS ON MY BUDDY FARIK? DID THEY BREAK HIM YET? THAT INFORMATION IS COMPARTMENTALIZED. I HAVEN'T BEEN READ IN ON THE PROGRAM. BUT THE ANSWER IS NO. CAN'T SAY I'M SURPRISED. SO, WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN SAN DIEGO? DO YOU REMEMBER BENITO VELASQUEZ, FROM LAMBROOK? BEN? MM-HM. MARABI? MM-HM. GANG MEMBER, CONVERTED IN PRISON, STUDIED WITH THE LIBRARIAN, YEAH. WELL, RIGHT AFTER YOUR RELEASE, HE STEPPED UP TO THE PLATE, FILLED YOUR SHOES AS THE LIBRARIAN'S RIGHT HAND MAN. WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH ME? VELASQUEZ WAS RELEASED A FEW MONTHS AGO. MOVED IN WITH HIS PARENTS IN BOYLE HEIGHTS, AND HE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN STAYING OUT OF TROUBLE AND KEEPING HIS NOSE CLEAN. BUT...? BUT...YEAH, BUT. HE WAS RECENTLY SPOTTED AT THE ISLAMIC CENTER HERE IN SAN DIEGO ATTENDING THE MOSQUE. SO WE PUT A TAIL ON HIM, IT TURNS OUT HE'S BEEN DRIVING DOWN FOR SERVICES EVERY WEEKEND. SO WHY DOESN'T HE ATTEND A MOSQUE IN L.A. UNLESS HE'S BEEN ORDERED TO STAY AWAY FROM THE LOCAL ISLAMIC COMMUNITY? MM-HM, WHICH IS THE FIRST OPERATIONAL RULE OF AN ISLAMIC EXTREMIST SLEEPER CELL. NO PUBLIC DISPLAYS OF FAITH SO AS NOT TO DRIVE THE ATTENTION-- ATTENTION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. SO YOU WANT ME TO CHECK HIM OUT? [SIGHING] PATRICE, WHAT YOU SHOULD DO, BRING IN A NEW U.C., START FROM SCRATCH, AND HAVE HIM BUDDY UP TO BENITO MAKE FRIENDS, GO FROM THERE. UH, YEAH. BUT THAT WOULD ALL REQUIRE TIME, MONEY AND EFFORT THAT HAVEN'T BEEN ALLOCATED. YOU'RE ALREADY HERE. YOU'RE THE BEST WE HAVE. *** I'M DONE. GAYLE BROUGHT MARCUS DOWN HERE ON VACATION. YOU ALREADY HELPED SAVE THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES, DARWYN. YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAVE GAYLE BISHOP. THAT IS NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS. AND I'M NOT TRYING TO SAVE HER. I'M TRYING TO GET MY LIFE BACK TOGETHER. YOU KNOW, AND TRUTHFULLY, I...I REALLY DON'T NEED YOU OR ANYBODY FROM THE BUREAU TRYING TO TELL ME HOW TO DO THAT, YOU UNDERSTAND? YEAH. YEAH, I DO. THAT IS YOUR BUSINESS. BUT BENITO VELASQUEZ IS FBI BUSINESS. HE WAS IN PRISON WITH YOU, SO YOU'RE LEGIT IN HIS BOOK. HE'S IN SAN DIEGO, YOU'RE IN SAN DIEGO-- I DON'T KNOW. ALLAH WORKS IN MYSTERIOUS WAYS. *** OKAY. OKAY. ONE CONDITION. MM-HM? GAYLE'S SISTER AND HER FAMILY ARE IN TOWN, SO I'M GONNA NEED THE BUREAU TO HOOK ME UP WITH A STACK OF PLATINUM PASSPORT TICKETS TO SEA WORLD, AND DINNER WITH THE SHAMU SHOW. MARCUS LOVES WHALES. [CALL TO PRAYER] [IMAM SPEAKING ARABIC] *** [SPEAKING ARABIC] DARWYN? [CHUCKLES] WHAT THE FUCK, MAN? GOOD TO SEE YOU REMEMBER ME, BENNY. PARADISE IS IN THE SHADOW OF THE FUCKING SEWERS, MAN. HOW'D YOU FIND ME? I SAW YOU PRAYING AT THE MOSQUE BUT I DIDN'T WANNA TALK TO YOU THERE IN CASE THE COPS OR THE FEDS WERE WATCHING. SO I FOLLOWED YOU. WHICH MEANS I SHOULD BE A LITTLE MORE CAREFUL. LOOK, BENNY [CLEARS THROAT] THE SHIT THAT I WAS DOING IN L.A. A WHILE BACK, IT WAS-- IT WAS BIG AND-- YOU MIGHT HAVE READ ABOUT IT, SEEN SOMETHING ON THE NEWS? YEAH, I KNOW. THAT THING IN L.A. DARWYN YOU'RE HOT, I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE SEEN TOGETHER. JUST...JUST LISTEN TO ME. I GOT A PLAN, AND I NEED YOUR HELP. I GOT A LINE ON THE FBI BASE CELL IF I DON'T FUCK UP THAT THING IN L.A. NOW, I CAN GET TO HER, MAKE HER AN EXAMPLE. PAYBACK. BUT I CAN'T DO IT ALONE. JUST HOLD OUT, BRO. YOU GOT TO ME ALL WRONG, MAN. ALL THAT RADICAL HATE THE LIBRARIAN WAS PREACHING BACK IN LAMBROOK, I BOUGHT INTO THAT SHIT TO SURVIVE PRISON. I RAN WITH THE BROTHERHOOD TO KEEP MY ASS SAFE, ALL RIGHT MAN? BUT NOW THAT I'M OUT, MAN, I TURNED THE PAGE. I'M A PEACEFUL BROTHER. [WHISPERING] WE COULD STRIKE A BLOW FOR THE CAUSE. SORRY, DARWYN, YOU GOT THE WRONG GUY. DON'T COME SEE ME AGAIN, BRO. I MIGHT HAVE TO CALL THE COPS. THE WEEKEND OF SEPTEMBER 2ND THROUGH THE 4TH, 2005, YOU MET WITH TWO MEN IN LAS VEGAS. THE LEADER OF THE NEW YORK CELL WAS ADIS SAHILA, ALSO KNOWN AS DIMITRI GONEZ, TRUE IDENTITY RASHEED WAMAR AL-TUFAH, BASYAD EGYPT. AND LEADER OF THE WASHINGTON D.C. CELL, OPERATING UNDER THE NAME OF JULIO TORRES. WHAT'S HIS REAL NAME? IS HE KNOWN BY ANY OTHER ALIASES? WHAT'S HIS COUNTRY OF ORIGIN? DID HE DO JIHAD WITH YOU IN AFGHANISTAN? YOU WANNA GO BACK TO THE WATER ROOM, SON, HMM? [SNICKERS] YOU ALMOST DROWNED THE LAST TIME. COME ON, MAN, WE'VE BEEN GOING OVER THIS SAME SHIT FOR MONTHS. GIVE ME AN ANSWER. JULIO TORRES GOT AWAY, HUH? YOU GOTTA HAND IT TO THOSE HISPANICS. BUT IN A WAY, UH, WE CONQUERED SPAIN AND MADE IT AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE MUSLIM WORLD FOR WHAT, CLOSE TO 800 YEARS, SO I'M NOT SURPRISED SENOR TORRES OUTSMARTED YOU. LET'S CHANGE THE SUBJECT. WHO IS THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN MEMBER OF YOUR CELL? HIS NAME WAS, UH, HIS NAME WAS MARTIN. MARTIN LUTHER KING. [SAHAD SCREAMING] COME ON, SAHAD! OH, WAIT, EXCUSE ME. FARIS AL-FARIK, PUNK! ACT LIKE A FUCKING JIHADI FOR GOD'S SAKES! NOW DO ME A FAVOR, BOB. BABY-SIT THIS RAG HEAD FOR ME WHILE I GO TO THE BATHROOM. I GOTTA TAKE A SHIITE. OR IS IT A SUNNI? [SAHAD GROANING] COME ON. [SAHAD PANTING] COME ON. ALL RIGHT? [SAHAD PANTING] FUCK! WHY DO YOU SIT THERE WITH YOUR PEN AND PAPER, DAY AFTER DAY? I KNOW THIS IS BEING RECORDED. AUDIO, VIDEO. WHAT'S THE POINT? *** [LAUGHS] IT'S MY PROCESS. I'M SURE YOU HAD A PROCESS. MAYBE YOU STILL DO, EVEN NOW. I KNOW I WOULD. [SLURPING TEA] SO, NO BITES FROM VELASQUEZ? NO. I THINK HE'S CLEAN. ASKED TO LEAVE HIM IN PEACE. KEEP AN EYE ON HIM, JUST IN CASE. SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN. I THOUGHT YOU'D BE AT SEA WORLD USING THOSE PLATINUM PASSPORTS WITH GAYLE AND THE KIDS. YEAH. [CLEARS THROAT] YOU SEE, GAYLE'S SISTER HAS THIS HUSBAND. HE AND I DON'T REALLY GET ALONG. MIGHT BE AWKWARD. THOUGHT IT'D BE BETTER TO HANG BACK. THAT'S VERY DIPLOMATIC OF YOU. [SNICKERS] SO, THAT'S IT? THAT'S IT. YOU'RE OFF THE CLOCK. I'M GOING OVERSEAS FOR A FEW WEEKS. I'M GONNA DO TDY WITH THE JOINT TERRORISM TASKFORCE IN THE SUDAN. THE LAGAT UNCOVERED A RECENTLY DISMANTLED AL-QAEDA TRAINING CAMP JUST OUTSIDE KHARTOUM. SO I'M GONNA GO WITH THE EVIDENCE COLLECTION TEAM, CHECK IT OUT. LISTEN, I'M TAKING, UH-- GAYLE AND MARCUS TO DINNER A LITTLE BIT LATER. YOU WANNA TAG ALONG? I HAVE A PLANE TO CATCH. I THINK IT MIGHT BE AWKWARD. PROBABLY BEST TO HANG BACK. THAT'S VERY DIPLOMATIC OF YOU. MM. *** [KNOCKING] *** PERFECT TIMING. DINNER IS SERVED. WHO ARE YOU LISTENING TO? *** MM. NOW WE'RE PLUGGED INTO EACH OTHER. COOL MAN, BUT THIS ISN'T REALLY PLUGGED IN. * SAY YOU WANNA BLOW SOME TREES WITH ME * * YOU SAY YOU WANT A SIMPLE EASE WITH ME * * BUT YOU SAY YOU DON'T WANNA SLEEP WITH ME * * COZ YOU KNOW MY RECORD IS PLAYING A ROUGH RIDE * * SAY YOU WANNA BLOW SOME TREES WITH ME * * YOU SAY YOU WANT A SIMPLE EASE WITH ME * * BUT YOU SAY YOU DON'T WANNA SLEEP WITH ME * THIS IS PLUGGED IN. Sahad: YOU ALWAYS DRINK TEA HERE. AMERICANS, THEY NEVER DRINK TEA. I STARTED DRINKING TEA IN THE MOUNTAINS OF A TOWN CALLED RU-YE SANG, IN THE COAST PROVINCE OF AFGHANISTAN WITH MY MUJAHADEEN BROTHERS. I GAVE THEM STINGERS. THEY GAVE ME TEA. IN THE LONG RUN, I'M NOT SURE WHO GOT THE BETTER DEAL. *** [SPEAKS ARABIC] I WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE A CUP OF TEA. [DOOR OPENS] ALL RIGHT, TIME TO PICK UP WHERE WE LEFT OFF. WHO WAS THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN MEMBER OF YOUR CELL? AND I SWEAR TO ALLAH, IF YOU SAY MALCOLM X I'M GONNA KICK YOUR BALLS UP INTO YOUR THROAT AND HOLD THEM THERE UNTIL YOU CHOKE ON 'EM. NAH, IT WASN'T MALCOLM X. IT WAS COLIN POWELL. *** [SAHAD MOANING] [SAHAD GROANING] NOTHING EVEN CLOSE TO THE FRONT PAGE. I'M HAPPY TO SAY I'M NOT A STAR ANYMORE. YOU'RE A COOKING STAR. YOU KNOW EVERY TIME WE HAVE SEX IT'S LIKE THE ULTIMATE "FUCK YOU" TO BUSH, CHENEY, AND THE WHOLE 9/11 PLOT. I JUST KEEP PICTURING GIULIANI AND THE REST OF THOSE ASSHOLES SUPERVISING THE WHOLE THING FROM THAT $15 MILLION BUNKER ON THE 23RD FLOOR OF BUILDING 7. YOU KNOW THAT'S WHERE THEY BROADCAST THE HOMING SIGNAL FROM TO MAKE SURE THE PLANES WOULD HIT THE TOWERS. I KNOW, AND THE PENTAGON WAS ACTUALLY HIT BY A CIA GLOBAL HAWK DRONE SO THE ADMINISTRATION COULD START AN ENDLESS WAR AND TURN AMERICA INTO A POLICE STATE. AND WHAT IDIOT COULD BELIEVE THAT OSAMA BIN LADEN AND HIS CAVE-DWELLING MUSLIM MILITIA MANAGED TO OUTSMART THE C.I.A., THE N.S.A. AND THE PENTAGON UNLESS UNCLE SAM WAS BEHIND THE WHOLE THING? NOT ME. *** [CAR ENGINE STARTS] [TIRES SCREECHING] GET IN THE FUCKING CAR! *** Darwyn: I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU GUYS ARE BUT... Man: SHUT THE FUCK UP OR I'LL SHOOT YOU.

THIRD BATTALION, 75TH REGIMENT. SURVIVAL, EVASION, RESISTANCE, ESCAPE. I WAS FUCKING TRAINED TO DO THIS SHIT. I FIND IT DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE YOU'RE THAT GOOD. TO ESCAPE THE AUTHORITIES AND NO ONE GOT A PICTURE OF YOU? IT WAS WHAT THEY TAUGHT ME IN AFGHANISTAN. I GOT THE HELL OUT OF L.A. AND I'VE BEEN HIDING OUT EVER SINCE! DID YOU KNOW WE HAVE PEOPLE AT DODGER STADIUM WATCHING YOUR EVERY MOVE? SHALL I BRING THEM HERE TO TELL YOU WHAT THEY SAW? IF THAT WAS FUCKING TRUE YOU WOULDN'T BE HOLDING A GUN IN MY FACE. FUCK. YOU EITHER KILL ME OR YOU'LL BE KISSING MY ASS. I'M TELLING YOU THE FUCKING TRUTH. GET OUT. [TIRES SCREECHING] *** *** TELL ME SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW, SAHAD. TELL ME SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW SO WE BOTH CAN GET SOME SLEEP. I WOULD LIKE... A CUP OF TEA, PLEASE. [SLURPING] YOU GOTTA GIVE BEFORE YOU GET. WELL, IN THAT CASE, GIVE AGENT SERXNER MY REGARDS. Man: ISN'T THAT THE NAME OF YOUR LEAD AGENT IN THE L.A. OPERATION? YEAH, PATRICE SERXNER. JESUS CHRIST! AREN'T YOU BUREAU PEOPLE FAMILIAR WITH EVEN THE MOST BASIC TRADE CRAFT? EVER HEARD OF USING A PSEUDO NAME OR INFORMATION DISCIPLINE? YOU'RE JUMPING TO CONCLUSIONS. JUST BECAUSE HE KNOWS HER NAME, IT DOESN'T MEAN IT CAME FROM US. BESIDES, WHERE'S THAT INFO GOING ANYWAY? *** Velasquez: YO, DARWYN! *** MOTHERFUCKER! YOU DIDN'T THINK I'D RECOGNIZE YOUR CHOLO ASS UNDERNEATH THAT MASK? I WAS THE FUCKING DRIVER, MAN.

EVANGELICAL BIBLE THUMPERS FROM SANDUSKY, OHIO. THAT'S RIGHT OUTSIDE OF CLEVELAND. MY PARENTS DRAGGED ME TO CHURCH EVERY SUNDAY. BIBLE SCHOOL, THE WHOLE WORKS. AND THEN WHEN I WAS 9 YEARS OLD, JUST BEFORE CHRISTMAS, I FELL THROUGH THE ICE ON PICKEREL CREEK. I WAS DEAD FOR 21 MINUTES. NOTHING HAPPENED. THERE WAS NO LIGHT, NO VOICES, NO ANGELS. JUST NOTHING. AND THAT'S WHEN I FIGURED IT OUT. THAT'S WHY I CRACKED THE ORGANIZED RELIGION CODE. I REALIZED IT WAS JUST A MIND GAME. GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD. A PURE FUCKING HUSTLE. IT STARTED TO HELP PEOPLE WITH THEIR FEAR OF DEATH AND THEN SNATCHED UP BY A FEW AS A POWERFUL TOOL TO CONTROL THE MASSES, FEAR OF GOD, INVISIBLE MAN. PURE FUCKING GENIUS. HELL, IF MY OLD MAN WAS A MUSLIM INSTEAD OF A CHRISTIAN AND I HADN'T FALLEN THROUGH THE ICE, I'D BE LOOKING TO SLAM A PLANE INTO A BUILDING TOO. FACE IT, MY FRIEND, THERE'S NO PARADISE WAITING FOR YOU. NO VIRGINS WAITING TO SUCK YOU OFF FOR ALL ETERNITY. WHICH MEANS THAT EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE, ALL THE PAIN THAT YOU'VE INFLICTED AND ALL THE SUFFERING YOU'VE GONE THROUGH AND ALL THE SUFFERING YOU'RE GONNA PUT YOURSELF THROUGH FROM HERE ON OUT, ALL OF IT -- IT'S FOR NOTHING. *** *** BROTHER AL-HAKIM.

IT'S AN HONOR TO MEET YOU, DARWYN. BROTHER KHALID SAYS YOU'RE A VETERAN MUJAHID. MAYBE SOMEDAY YOU CAN SHARE SOME OF YOUR EXPERIENCES WITH US. GERMAN? DUTCH, ACTUALLY. I THOUGHT SHE WAS FRENCH. SINCE WHEN DO WE INVOLVE WOMEN IN OUR OPERATIONS? SINCE WHEN DO WE NOT? THE FIRST MARTYR IN ISLAM WAS A WOMAN, SUMAYA... SUMAYA, I KNOW. SHE WAS KILLED IN FRONT OF HER CHILDREN FOR REFUSING TO WORSHIP IDOLS. SHE WASN'T SOME WHITE CHICK FROM AMSTERDAM. IT'S VERY SIMPLE, MY HUSBAND IS-- WAS A DEDICATED HOLY WARRIOR, EXPERT IN DEMOLITIONS. HE DIED A MARTYR'S DEATH, FIGHTING THE AMERICANS IN IRAQ. BUT NOT BEFORE HE TAUGHT ME EVERYTHING HE KNEW ABOUT ISLAM AND HOW TO BLOW THINGS UP. Khalid: BROTHER DARWYN HAS SECURED THE FUNDING FOR US TO CONTINUE OUR OPERATIONS. OUR ATTACK.

IT'S TIME FOR ME TO GO. THERE HAVE BEEN NO NEW REPORTS ABOUT THE DODGER STADIUM ATTACK FOR A LONG TIME, THE STORY IS FINALLY DYING DOWN. I THINK IT'S FINALLY SAFE TO RISK TRAVELING. I CLEANED THE APARTMENT. NO FINGERPRINTS, NO DNA FIBERS, IT WILL BE AS IF I NEVER EXISTED. I'M GONNA TRY TO MAKE IT TO CANADA. I PACKED A SUITCASE FOR YOU. I COULD DROP YOU OFF AT HOME, AND YOU'LL NEVER SEE ME AGAIN. OR...? OR YOU CAN COME WITH ME. *** SO WHAT'S UP? WHAT ARE WE... WHAT ARE WE DOING? SCOUTING TARGETS OR...? PATIENCE, PATIENCE. I JUST... I WANT YOUR HELP RUNNING A FEW ERRANDS, THAT'S ALL. FLASHY WHEELS. YOU KNOW, FOR A BELIEVER WHO'S CRYING ABOUT NOT HAVING ACCESS TO ENOUGH FUNDS, YOU CAN DO AN ENTIRE OP AT THE COST OF THIS RIDE. [SNICKERS] IT'S MY ONE INDULGENCE. BESIDES... A LAND CRUISER IS THE VEHICLE OF CHOICE FOR HOLY WARRIORS AROUND THE WORLD. [SNICKERS] SO TELL ME ABOUT YOUR, UH, FORMER LEADER, BROTHER FARIK. Darwyn: WHAT'S TO TELL? HE WAS HARDCORE, ALWAYS TWO STEPS AHEAD OF EVERYBODY ELSE. SMARTEST GUY IN THE WORLD. A TRUE BELIEVER. BUT HE GOT CAUGHT. YOU DIDN'T. HM? MAYBE ALLAH WAS TOO BUSY TO WATCH OVER US BOTH THAT DAY. MAYBE I JUST GOT LUCKY. *** Darwyn: IS THIS THE ERRAND? YOU GET ME OUT OF BED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT TO WASH A CAR. [CHUCKLING] RELAX. MY VEHICLE NEEDS TO LOOK GOOD FOR WHERE WE'RE GOING. *** COME ON, I LOVE THIS CAR. YOU KNOW IT'S EQUIPPED WITH A GPS TRACKING SYSTEM. I PROGRAMMED IT WITH ALL THE CELL PHONES OF MY MUJAHADEEN. I TRACKED YOUR CELL PHONE TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS. IT GOT ME THINKING, WHY WOULD AN EX-CON BE MEETING WITH HIS PAROLE OFFICER WHEN HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE HIDING FROM EVERY COP IN THE COUNTRY. *** [DARWYN GROANS] *** [CELL PHONE BEEPING] [SIRENS BLARING] Man: LAPD IS COOPERATING WITH US, AND WE'RE FEEDING THE STORY TO THE LOCAL NEWS THAT OUR CORPSE WAS THE VICTIM OF A LATE-NIGHT CARJACKING. WE GAVE THEM THE NAME ON THE DRIVER'S LICENSE, KHALID NUR AL DIN. AND THAT'S WHERE IT'S GONNA STAND TILL WE CAN LIFT PRINTS, RUN THEM THROUGH THE SYSTEM, FIND OUT WHO HE REALLY WAS. YOU'RE GONNA HANDLE THAT GRAND JURY FOR ME? I'LL COVER IT. WHAT ABOUT THE CARD? TECHS ARE TELLING US IT'S A SECURE I.D. AUTHENTICATOR. IT'S A MICROPROCESSOR CARD RUNNING ON A VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORK. THE LED SHOWS INFORMATION DOWNLOADED TO THE CARD, INFORMATION THAT CHANGES EVERY FEW SECONDS. Darwyn: THE NUMBERS LOOK LIKE A URL. MIGHT HAVE BEEN KHALID'S WAY OF RECEIVING COMMUNICATION FROM OVERSEAS. Darwyn: WHAT ABOUT THE NEW CELL, ARE YOU GONNA ROUND THEM UP? NOT YET. THE LONGER WE PLAY THIS OUT, THE MORE COMMUNICATION WE CAN GET FROM WHOEVER'S ON THE OTHER END OF THAT AUTHENTICATOR CARD... AND THE HIGHER UP WE CAN MOVE ON THE AL-QAEDA CHAIN OF COMMAND. OKAY. Darwyn: BUT IF WE'RE GONNA DO THIS, WE'D BETTER GET OUR GAME FACES BACK ON. WE'VE BEEN TREATING THIS HALF ASSED. GET MY CASE AGENT BACK FROM THE SUDAN AND LET'S GET FOCUSED. *** * I'M A BELIEVER * ARE YOU A BELIEVER * I'M A BELIEVER...

IT WAS THAT FANCY LAND CRUISER HE TOOLED AROUND IN. OH, BLOODY FUCKING HELL! GOD! I CAN'T BELIEVE IT! WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO NOW? HUH? WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO?! KHALID WAS OUR LEADER. HE WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO KNEW THE TARGET. HE WAS IN TOUCH WITH THE BASE. HE WAS OUR MOST EXPERIENCED GUY. WITH HIM GONE... DARWYN, WHAT DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD DO? I THINK WE SHOULD KEEP GOING. IF WE GIVE UP NOW AND ABANDON THE MISSION, THEN... ALLAH IS JUST ANOTHER DEAD MUSLIM KILLED BY AN AMERICAN BULLET. Darwyn: HE WOULD, UM-- HE WOULD WANT US TO STAY STRONG. HE'S RIGHT. WE HAVE TO STAY ON THE TRUE PATH. BUT WE NEED A NEW LEADER. I KNEW KHALID BETTER THAN ANY OF YOU. I WAS HIS RIGHT HAND. IT SHOULD BE ME. Benito: I DON'T KNOW. DARWYN IS THE ONE WITH THE MOST EXPERIENCE, MAN. I STILL HAVE CONTACT WITH THE BASE OVERSEAS. I KNEW KHALID BEST. HE TRUSTED ME. Mina: NO! I TRUST YOU TOO, SALIM, WE ALL DO. BUT YOU'RE NOT READY. I ALSO THINK IT'S BEST DARWYN IS THE ONE. [SCOFFS] *** COME HERE, ALL OF YOU. *** I WANT YOU TO REPEAT AFTER ME. "I PLEDGE MY ABSOLUTE FEALTY TO A LIFE OF STRUGGLE, "TO A LIFE OF JIHAD, AGAINST ALL THE ENEMIES OF GOD." [ALL] I PLEDGE MY ABSOLUTE FEALTY TO A LIFE OF STRUGGLE, A LIFE OF JIHAD, AGAINST ALL THE ENEMIES OF GOD. "I KNOW THAT ANY WHO BREAK THIS OATH "BREAK IT TO THEIR OWN HURT." [ALL] I KNOW THAT ANY WHO BREAK THIS OATH BREAK IT TO THEIR OWN HURT. "BUT WHO SO FULFILS THIS COVENANT WITH GOD, "GOD WILL GIVE THEM A MIGHTY REWARD."

BUT I WANT SOMETHING. I WANT A CUP OF HOT TEA. IS THAT ALL? *** TARIQ ABDULHAKEEM. HE IS A SAUDI LIKE ME AND EVERYWHERE THAT THE ARAB MUJAHADEEN WENT IN AFGHANISTAN FROM THE START OF THE ANTI-SOVIET JIHAD TILL THE END, HE WAS THERE. *** THANK YOU. YOU'RE WELCOME. YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT WHAT YOU TOLD ME. WHY YOU THINK EVERYTHING I'VE DONE IS BULLSHIT, WHY YOU THINK IT'S A FACT THAT THERE'S NOTHING MORE TO EXISTENCE THAN THIS CELL WE'RE LOCKED IN, WHEN THE TRUE FACT IS THAT WHEN YOU WERE A BOY YOUR FAITH WAS TESTED... AND YOU FAILED. JUST LIKE YOU'RE GONNA FAIL WITH ME. [SAHAD SCREAMING] [CHUCKLES] JESUS! HE'S A POP STAR. Man: WHAT? TARIQ ABDULHAKEEM. HE'S LIKE THE BOB DYLAN OF SAUDI ARABIA.
