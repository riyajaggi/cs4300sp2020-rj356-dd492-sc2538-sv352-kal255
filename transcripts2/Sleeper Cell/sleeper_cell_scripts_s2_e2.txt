BESIDES, THE BIG PROBLEM IS, EVERYONE IN THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY, THEY ALL KNOW HOW HARD THE USG HAS CLAMPED DOWN ON LIVE STINGERS. SO? SO, THIS MAY BE A TEST, AND I DON'T WANNA PASS. I MANAGE TO COME UP WITH A LEGIT FIM-92B, I'M EITHER THE LUCKIEST TERRORIST ON THE PLANET OR... A GOVERNMENT AGENT. RIGHT, RIGHT, GOT IT, OKAY. SO, WHAT DO YOU DO?

I KNOW HOW THIS GOES, OKAY? MY JOB IS TO CONTROL THE U.C. AND CONTROL THE CASE BUT WE BOTH KNOW YOU'RE THE ONE RUNNING THIS OPERATION, RIGHT? AND THE REAL REASON THE DIRECTOR BROUGHT ME IN IS BECAUSE EVERYBODY IN THE L.A. OFFICE THINKS THIS JOB IS CURSED BUT YOU AND I, WE'RE GOING TO PROVE THEM WRONG. *** [BUZZER] [LOCK CLANKING] AS-SALAAM ALAIKUM. ALAIKUM AS-SALAAM. I'M LIEUTENANT HAYAT. I'M A MUSLIM CHAPLAIN.

OKAY, HIS NAME'S SARAB HASSANI, HE'S A PAKISTANI NATIONAL. HE USED TO SELL ARMS TO THE MUJAHEDIN AGAINST THE SOVIETS IN AFGHANISTAN. HE'S LIVING IN L.A. NOW AND OUR INFORMANTS SAY THAT HE'S BACK AT WORK, BROKERING DEALS FOR TERRORISTS. NOW, ITOS HAS AN OPEN INVESTIGATION ON THIS GUY AND THEY'RE LOOKING TO DO A STING. SO, HE SELLS YOU THE MISSILES, THEY PICK HIM UP, EVERYONE'S HAPPY. NO WAY. IT'S TOO RISKY. THERE ARE AGENTS EVERYWHERE, CAMERAS, RECORDING DEVICES, IT COULD BLOW THE ENTIRE OPERATION. WELL, THE DECISION'S ALREADY BEEN MADE FROM ON HIGH. SO, I'M SORRY, THERE'S JUST NOTHING I CAN DO ABOUT IT NOW. RUSSELL, YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE MY BACK, MAN, NOT TRY AND LOAN ME OUT TO OTHER CASES. FUCK. OKAY. HOW DO I FIND HASSANI? HOW IS SAMIA? Hayat: SAMIA? MY WIFE. SHE'S IN U.S. CUSTODY. I THOUGHT PERHAPS YOU SPOKE WITH HER. HOW MANY MUSLIM CHAPLAINS CAN THE U.S. POSSIBLY HAVE? WE COULD ALWAYS USE MORE. I COULD PROBABLY LOCATE HER FOR YOU, BUT YOU HAVE TO DO YOUR PART AS WELL. AND HELP THE AMERICANS? IF THEY CAN'T GET ANYTHING FROM YOU HERE, THEY WON'T HESITATE TO SEND YOU OVERSEAS, WHERE THE INTERROGATORS WON'T BE SO HUMANE. ONCE YOU ARE OUT OF AMERICAN HANDS, I CAN'T HELP YOU. I HAVE A DEATH SENTENCE WAITING FOR ME IN SAUDI ARABIA. DON'T GIVE THEM REASON TO SEND YOU AWAY. NOTHING GOOD CAN COME OF IT. Darwyn: I'VE BEEN IN COMMUNICATION WITH OUR SENIOR BROTHERS. THEY WANT EVERYTHING RUNNING SMOOTHLY AS IF NOTHING EVER HAPPENED TO KHALID. Darwyn: WE HAVE NO TIME TO WASTE. THEIR JUDGMENT WOULD BE UPON US VERY SOON. BENNY, I NEED YOU AND MINA TO SECURE A NEW BASE OF OPERATIONS. THERE ARE 3 DECOMMISSIONED HOSPITALS ON THAT PLAN. I THINK I'VE GOT AN IDEA OF HOW WE CAN RENT ONE OUT FOR A FEW MONTHS. SALIM... YOU'RE RIDING WITH ME. *** HEY, DARWYN. BLACK GUY AND ARAB GUY DRIVING AROUND L.A. WHO DO YOU THINK THE COPS WOULD RODNEY KING FIRST? YOU GOT ME. WELL, IN THE U.K. THEY ALWAYS GO AFTER THE PAKI. PAKI? I THOUGHT YOUR FAMILY WAS FROM IRAQ. NO, IT DON'T MATTER. I'M STILL A FUCKIN' PAKI TO 'EM. DO THEY CALL YOU THAT TO YOUR FACE? ALL THE TIME. ONCE, BACK IN SECONDARY SCHOOL, I GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT WITH A MATE OF MINE AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT IT WAS ABOUT. AS HE TURNED AWAY, I HEARD HIM SAY UNDER HIS BREATH... "BLOODY PAKI." SO I SHOVED HIM TO THE GROUND. AS HE'S LYING THERE, I THINK TO MYSELF THERE'S SO MANY WAYS I CAN HAVE THIS FUCKING GUY RIGHT NOW. WHAT WOULD HE REMEMBER MOST? BROKEN BONES HEAL, RIGHT? BUT TEETH... TEETH DON'T GROW BACK. SO I USED MY BEST PENALTY KICK AND I KNOCKED OUT 3 IN ONE GO. *** IS THIS YOUR FRONT? FRONT? THIS IS THE FINEST HALAL BUTCHER SHOP IN AMERICA. I COULD RETIRE FROM THE PROFITS ON MY SHOP ALONE BUT I HAVE A LEGACY TO UPHOLD. YEAH, I HEARD YOU HELPED TAKE DOWN THE SOVIETS IN AFGHANISTAN. I DID MORE THAN HELP. I WON THE WAR FOR THE MUJAHEDIN. WITHOUT HASSANI, THEY WOULD HAVE HAD NO GRENADES, NO MACHINE GUNS, NOT TO MENTION TANKS. THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO. WHEN I OPENED MY BUTCHER SHOP IN THE U.S., I THOUGHT I LEFT THE ARMS BUSINESS BEHIND, BUT ISLAM IS UNDER ATTACK, THE WORLD IS AT WAR, AND ONE CANNOT FIGHT A WAR WITHOUT THE PROPER WEAPONS. THAT IS WHY HASSANI HAS COME OUT OF RETIREMENT TO OFFER HIS SERVICES. I'M GONNA NEED SOME VERY, UH, SPECIALIZED EQUIPMENT. NO PROBLEM, I'LL HAVE IT TO YOU IN 48 HOURS. YOU REALIZE I'M TALKING ABOUT A SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILE, RIGHT? OF COURSE. I STILL HAVE CONTACTS IN THE ARMS WORLD THAT BELIEVE IN THE RIGHT PATH. I WILL NOT LIE TO YOU. THE MISSILE WILL BE EXPENSIVE TO OBTAIN, BUT HASSANI CAN. I'LL NEED 10% IN CASH UP FRONT. BRING IT TOMORROW OR THE DEAL IS OFF. [KNOCK ON DOOR] MS. BISHOP? YEAH. HI, I'M WARREN RUSSELL WITH THE FBI. I'M A COLLEAGUE OF DARWYN AL-SAYEED'S. HI. HI. DARWYN'S NOT HERE. OH, I KNOW, I KNOW. DID ANYTHING HAPPEN TO HIM? OH GOSH, NO, NO. NO, HE'S FINE. HE'S FINE. NO, I'M ACTUALLY HERE TO SEE YOU. MAY I COME IN? YEAH, YEAH. THANK YOU. COME IN. COME THROUGH HERE. SIT DOWN. THANK YOU. OH, SORRY. OH, THAT'S-- THAT'S OKAY. SORRY. I'M JUST CATCHING UP ON SOME PAPERWORK THAT INVOLVES YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH SPECIAL AGENT AL-SAYEED. WHAT, YOU GUYS ARE NOT GOING TO ALLOW US TO DATE ANYMORE? IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS. NO, BUT THIS IS, THIS IS AN NDA. NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT. FOR YOU TO SIGN. SO YOU'RE THE ONLY CIVILIAN THAT HAS ANY KNOWLEDGE OF AGENT AL-SAYEED'S UNDERCOVER WORK. SO YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY WE WOULD WANT TO SAFEGUARD AGAINST ANY INFORMATION LEAKS. OH, WELL, I WOULD NEVER SAY ANYTHING TO ANYBODY. OF COURSE NOT, I UNDERSTAND. ALL THE SAME, THOUGH, WE GOT TO HAVE IT IN WRITING, SO, YOU KNOW, JUST PUT YOUR SIGNATURE ON THE LAST PAGE THERE. THIS IS JUST A WRITTEN GUARANTEE THAT YOU WON'T REVEAL ANYTHING THAT YOU KNOW ABOUT AGENT AL-SAYEED'S ACTIVITIES. YOU WILL BE SUBJECT TO CRIMINAL PROSECUTION IF YOU DO. WHAT--PROSECUTION? MM-HM. BUT THERE IS NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT, NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. UNLESS YOU PLAN TO GO ON OPRAH OR SOMETHING. HA! JUST ON THE BOTTOM THERE. OH, OKAY. OH, HERE. Woman: OKAY, WATCH YOUR STEP RIGHT HERE. SEE, AFTER THE QUAKE IN '94, A LOT OF THESE BUILDINGS FAILED INSPECTION AND SOME COMPANIES FELT IT WAS EASIER TO JUST MOVE THAN TO TRY TO, YOU KNOW, RETROFIT THE WHOLE STRUCTURE. BUT NOW IT'S THE PERFECT LOCATION FOR YOUR HORROR MOVIE. DON'T YOU THINK? YEAH. YEAH? OKAY, SO WHAT'S IT CALLED? BECAUSE I LOVE SCARY MOVIES. IT'S, UH, IT'S CALLED KILL TEAM. IT'S SORT OF A HORROR/ACTION FLICK. THAT'S THE WORKING TITLE. YEAH. IT'S ABOUT HOW THE GOVERNMENT'S BEEN GENETICALLY ALTERING SOLDIERS TO BECOME ELITE KILLING MACHINES. THE ONLY TROUBLE IS THEY DID TOO GOOD OF A JOB. SO WHEN THE CIA COMES IN AND TRY TO TAKE 'EM OUT, TRIES TO EXECUTE 'EM, THEY COME BACK TO LIFE. AND WHO DO THEY GO FOR WHEN THEY WAKE UP IN THE MORGUE? HUH? THE NURSES. OH! YEAH. COULD WE SEE THE ROOF? NO PROBLEM, JUST FOLLOW ME. Hassani: YOU ARE SURE YOU DON'T WANT SOME RUGS? PERSIAN, ANATOLIAN, WHATEVER YOU LIKE. I CAN GET YOU GENUINE SEIRAFIAN. NO, I'M FINE, DAD. YOU'LL NEVER FIND A WIFE IF YOU DON'T LEARN TO DECORATE. SHOW PEOPLE YOU HAVE TASTE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? I KNOW YOU WOULDN'T HAVE DRIVEN ALL THE WAY OUT HERE JUST TO VISIT. A FATHER CAN'T MISS HIS OWN SON? COME ON, DAD, WHAT IS IT? IS THE SHOP OKAY? SO-SO. [HELICOPTER PASSING OVERHEAD] EVERYBODY IS A VEGETARIAN NOW. YEAH. MAYBE I'LL SELL IT SOON. BUT YOU LOVE THAT SHOP. HOW ELSE CAN I PAY FOR RETIREMENT? I'M IN DEBT. HOW MUCH? HOW MUCH? IT'S NOT YOUR WORRY. I HAVE DECIDED TO GO BACK TO THE OLD BUSINESS. NO. NO, DAD. DAD. I'M A U.S. MARINE. I DON'T EVEN WANT TO HEAR IT. JUST ONE DEAL, ONE DEAL, AND I CAN RETIRE. VISIT MY SON. ONE DAY MAYBE EVEN SEE MY GRANDCHILDREN. I DON'T EVEN WANT TO HEAR IT. RUSSIAN SA-18 GROUSE SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILE. ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND? IT'S FOR A COLLECTOR. BIG ESTATE IN ARIZONA. TO MOUNT ABOVE THE FIREPLACE. HE'LL NEVER USE IT. IT'S FINE. IT'S FINE? IT'S FUCKING ILLEGAL. AND IT'S IMPOSSIBLE. WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU GOING TO GET SOMETHING LIKE THAT, ANYHOW? I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU COULD HELP ME. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT YOU ARE ASKING ME? I KNOW THE U.S. MILITARY HAS STOCKPILES OF FOREIGN WEAPONS. OH, YOU HAVE COMPLETELY LOST IT. DO YOU KNOW, I ALMOST DIDN'T PASS MY BACKGROUND CHECK BECAUSE OF YOU AND YOUR FUCKED-UP PAST? AND NOW YOU'RE HERE AND THREATENING MY CAREER ALL OVER AGAIN. WHAT I SHOULD DO IS PICK UP THE PHONE AND REPORT YOU TO THE FBI. PLEASE, OMAR... FOR YOUR FATHER. I'LL NEVER ASK ANYTHING OF YOU AGAIN. I HAVE WORK TO DO. YOU CAN LET YOURSELF OUT. FOR YOUR SAKE AND MINE, THIS CONVERSATION NEVER HAPPENED. WHAT'S COOKING? OH-HO! MACARONI AND CHEESE WITH SLICED HOT DOGS IN HONOR OF OUR LAST NIGHT IN AMERICA. I'M SURE YOU'LL MAKE IT TASTE GOOD. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? HEY! WHERE DID YOU GET IT? FROM A BACKPACKER DOWN THE TRAIL. SOME GERMAN GUY. IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL. YOU'RE A FUCKING IDIOT. WHAT IF A COP SAW YOU BUYING DRUGS? WHAT IF THAT WAS A COP SELLING IT TO YOU? COME ON, IT'S JUST POT. IT'S ENOUGH TO GET US ARRESTED AND IT'S ENOUGH TO FUCK EVERYTHING UP AND WE'RE 5 MILES FROM THE CANADIAN BORDER. SHIT. JESUS, ILIJA. SEE, THIS IS THE KIND OF PARANOIA THE U.S. GOVERNMENT PUTS INTO PEOPLE. YES. U.S. GOVERNMENT, CORPORATIONS, THE CHURCH, THEY ARE ALL OUT TO CONTROL YOU THROUGH FEAR. WE'RE JUST HAVING A GOOD TIME. WE'RE NOT HURTING ANYBODY. THAT FEAR SPOILS EVERYTHING. BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUY INTO IT. I DON'T. COME ON, GET HIGH WITH ME. ONE LAST CHANCE TO TELL THIS COUNTRY TO KISS YOUR ASS BEFORE WE LEAVE. OH... WHERE ARE YOU GOING? HELP ME PACK UP. WE'RE LEAVING. WHAT? YOU PUT US IN DANGER. WE HAVE TO GO. YOU'RE CRAZY. NO! JUST DRIVEN BY FEAR. GOT THE BEST DRY CLEANER IN THE CITY SO THE BILLS ARE UNTRACEABLE. VERY GOOD. WHO'S YOUR ASSOCIATE? MY BACKUP. CARRYING TEN GRAND IN CASH IS RISKY BUSINESS. WE'RE STILL ON SCHEDULE? THIS IS A VERY HARD-TO-FIND PIECE YOU ASKED FOR. MY SOURCES IN CALIFORNIA ARE TEMPORARILY SOLD OUT. YOU'RE SOLD OUT? BUT... I HAVE ANOTHER SOURCE WHO WILL SHIP THEM IN FROM OUT OF STATE, ESPECIALLY FOR HASSANI. THERE MAY BE SMALL DELAY BUT THEY WILL BE HERE VERY SOON. YOU HAVE MY WORD. YOUR LAST WORD WAS 48 HOURS. RELAX, HASSANI WON THE WAR FOR THE AFGHANS. HE WILL WIN THE WAR FOR YOU. REMEMBER, THE BEST PRODUCTS ALWAYS TAKE A BIT LONGER. MY SUIT, 8 MONTHS. MR. DARWYN, A GIFT FOR YOU. OUR MOST SELECT HALAL LAMB CHOPS. THE FINEST IN THE COUNTRY. GRILL THEM UP, YOU WILL SEE. HASSANI DOES NOT LIE. I MADE SOME INQUIRIES FOR YOU ABOUT YOUR WIFE. AND I FLOATED THE IDEA OF A MEETING BETWEEN YOU AND HER. AND? THEY SAY THEY WOULD CONSIDER IT IF YOU'LL FINALLY COOPERATE. BROTHER, REMEMBER WHAT THE HOLY QU'RAN SAYS. REPEL EVIL WITH THAT WHICH IS BETTER, THEN YOUR ENEMY WILL BECOME YOUR TRUSTED FRIEND. MY WIFE IS INNOCENT. SHE'S DONE NOTHING. LISTEN, THE PROSPECT OF SEEING HER AGAIN WOULD HAVE BEEN UNTHINKABLE A MONTH AGO. NOW IT'S A REAL POSSIBILITY. THIS IS A VICTORY FOR YOU, SEIZE IT. [ROARS] [SHRIEKING] THERE WAS A CONTINGENCY PLAN IN PLACE. IF WE EVER NEEDED TO HIDE OUT OR FLEE THE COUNTRY. THE YMCA IN HOPE STREET, DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES, LOCKER 67. YOU WILL FIND EVERYTHING IN THERE. [SPEAKING ARABIC] [SOBBING] *** HI, MOM. LISTEN, JANET, THE KIDS JUST GOT HOME. I WILL SEE YOU AT THE BENEFIT. OKAY, BYE. YOU TOOK THEM SHOPPING? I THOUGHT YOU SAID THEY COULD USE NEW OUTFITS. YOU GOT THEM TO SIT STILL LONG ENOUGH TO TRY ON CLOTHES? WELL, I BRIBED THEM WITH BEN & JERRY'S. MINA LET ME HAVE A BROWNIE SUNDAE. I KNOW. YOU HATE THOSE, DON'T YOU? I HAD LOW-FAT FROZEN YOGURT. LENNY ROSEN'S MOM SAYS ICE CREAM GIVES YOU HIPS. THEY HAD A GREAT SALE IN BURBERRY'S. I GOT A KILT FOR DAKOTA AND A NOVA CHECK BUTTON-DOWN AND KHAKIS FOR CODY. THAT IS TOO CUTE. IS THAT EVERYTHING, THEN, MRS. ROSSMAN? OH. YOU'RE NOT COMING WITH US TONIGHT? COME ON, MINA. IT'S GOING TO BE SO BORING. PLEASE. I CAN'T. I HAVE A DATE. OOH! WHO'S THE LUCKY GUY? WELL, IT'S MORE LIKE A FIRST MEETING. COFFEE. WE MET ONLINE. BE CAREFUL, MINA, THERE'S A LOT OF PSYCHOS ON THE INTERNET. I WILL. THANK YOU. Mina: THERE ARE SECURE STORAGE FACILITIES, MEETING ROOMS, PLENTY OF BEDS IF YOU NEED TO SLEEP HERE. THERE IS ALSO A COURTYARD ENTRANCE HIDDEN FROM THE STREET WHERE WE CAN LOAD AND UNLOAD CARGO. AND THE ROOFTOP, IT'S VERY DEFENSIBLE. WE CAN MAKE A LAST STAND THERE IF NEED BE. HOLD OFF AUTHORITIES FOR HOURS, MAYBE DAYS. THESE LAMB CHOPS ARE THE SHIT, MAN. AT LEAST HASSANI IS GOOD FOR SOMETHING. HEY, BOSS. YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR BOYS DOES AFTER HE LEAVES THE BUTCHER SHOP? DON'T REALLY CARE, AS LONG AS HE GETS US THE GOODS. DRIVES A CAB. HOW MANY ARMS DEALERS DO YOU KNOW WHO DRIVE A FUCKING CAB? HOW MANY HOLY WARRIORS DO YOU KNOW WHO WORK AS NANNIES, OR RUN A GROCERY STORE IN EAST L.A.? HMM? IT'S CALLED A COVER. AND, INSHALLAH, YOU BETTER HAVE A GOOD ONE. FOLLOWING HIM AROUND AT NIGHT, HE'S PROBABLY MADE YOU ALREADY. LET THIS BE A LESSON TO ALL OF YOU. WE CANNOT AFFORD ANY MISTAKES. UNDERSTOOD? YOU TOO BUSY TO RETURN MY CALL? MR. DARWYN, PLEASE. WHERE ARE MY GOODS? GOODS, BADS, INDIFFERENT. IT IS COMING, MY FRIEND. JUST SOME DELAYS, VERY SMALL. I WORK NONSTOP TO GET THEM FOR YOU. I KNOW YOU WORK NONSTOP IN THIS CAB TILL 2 IN THE MORNING. HOW THE FUCK DOES THAT HELP ME? I... HOW?! I AM LEGITIMATE, I SWEAR. SHIT! WHO'S YOUR SOURCE? WHO'S SUPPLYING THE MATERIAL? I CAN'T TELL YOU. THESE MEN ARE VERY POWERFUL. THEY WILL KILL ME. I OUGHTA KILL YOU RIGHT NOW. IF YOU KILL ME THEN YOU WILL NEVER GET YOUR WEAPON, OKAY. IT'LL MAKE ME FEEL BETTER. NO! NO, PLEASE! PLEASE. I--I NEED TO MAKE THE SALE. WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU BEING A BIG-TIME ARMS DEALER? I WAS. AMERICANS HELPED MAKE ME RICH. SO, I TAKE MY FAMILY TO U.S., OPENED A LEGITIMATE BUSINESS. BUT THINGS DON'T WORK OUT THE WAY I PLAN. WE WERE WEALTHY IN PAKISTAN, WE'RE POOR IN AMERICA. I WAS AN IMPORTANT PERSON, MR. DARWYN. NOW I DRIVE A TAXI AND SELL LAMB CHOPS BECAUSE THAT IS ALL I CAN DO IN THIS COUNTRY. THIS IS NOT HASSANI. I CAN HELP YOU. PLEASE, JUST GIVE ME THE CHANCE. FUCK. FUCK. MY CONTACTS ARE STILL GOOD. MY--MY SON, HE IS A U.S. MARINE, VERY HIGH RANK. HE'S GETTING THE MISSILE FOR ME. YOU WILL HAVE IT, I SWEAR. I JUST NEED A LITTLE MORE TIME, PLEASE. * WHAT ISN'T CRIME IS LIKE WHAT ISN'T RHYME * * SO PASS THE JOINT-- [RAP CONTINUES, INDISTINCT] HE'S A DUD, A FRAUD. HE IS A CON ARTIST. DID YOU EVEN CHECK INTO THIS GUY? WHAT? INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM OPERATION SECTION SENT HIM TO US. DID YOU CHECK HIM OUT PERSONALLY? LOOK, RUSSELL, THE WAY THIS WORKS IS YOU'RE MY LAST LINE OF DEFENSE. WHY DIDN'T YOU CHECK INTO THIS GUY'S BACKGROUND? HE CLAIMS HIS SON CAN SLIP HIM AN SA-18, NO PROBLEM. DOES THAT SOUND CREDIBLE TO YOU? OUR INFORMANT SAID HE'S STILL A BIG-TIME ARMS DEALER. YOUR INFORMANTS ARE GIVING YOU BULLSHIT INFORMATION AND WE'RE THE ONES GETTING FUCKED. MAYBE 20 YEARS AGO THIS GUY WAS A PLAYER BUT THESE DAYS HE'S LIVING IN A FANTASY WORLD. YOU'LL BE LUCKY IF HE CAN BUY A FUCKING HANDGUN. WHY THE HELL DID HASSANI AGREE TO BROKER A DEAL FOR YOU, THEN? THIS POOR MOTHERFUCKER STILL THINKS HE CAN GET BACK IN THE GAME. EVERY DAY THAT GOES BY WITHOUT THAT MISSILE, I'M LOSING CREDIBILITY. BUT, HEY, EVEN IF HASSANI ISN'T THE REAL DEAL, MAYBE WE CAN TURN HIM INTO THE REAL DEAL. [DOOR SLAMS] YOU'VE GOT TWO MINUTES. STICK TO ENGLISH OR WE'LL CUT YOU OFF QUICKER THAN YOU CAN BLINK. SAMIA. SAMIA, HOW ARE THEY TREATING YOU? I'M FINE. THEY HAVEN'T MISTREATED ME. I STILL HAVEN'T SEEN A LAWYER YET. WHY HASN'T SHE SEEN A LAWYER? SHE'S DONE NOTHING. Samia: ONLY YOU CAN HELP US. I HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO ASMAD IN MONTHS. THEY WON'T TELL ME WHERE SHE IS. I KNOW THAT YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU, BUT OUR FAMILY HAS BEEN DESTROYED. YOU HAVE TO BE STRONG, SAMIA. Samia: THINK OF OUR DAUGHTER. SHE'S JUST A CHILD. IMAGINE WHAT THEY CAN DO TO HER. DON'T LET THEM USE OUR DAUGHTER AS A BARGAINING CHIP. SHE LIVES IN ANOTHER COUNTRY. THEY CAN'T TOUCH HER. ALLAH WILL PROTECT HER. YOU'RE HER FATHER. YOU SHOULD BE THE ONE PROTECTING HER. IF YOU HAD MARTYRED YOURSELF ON THAT DAY, AT LEAST WE COULD BE IN MOURNING. [SOBBING] BUT NOW WE ARE LOST. I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S DAY OR IF IT'S NIGHT. THEY KEEP ASKING ME QUESTIONS I CAN'T ANSWER. ONLY YOU CAN STOP THIS. SAMIA, YOU'RE LETTING THEM POISON YOU. SAMIA, LOOK AT ME. LOOK AT ME, LOOK IN MY EYES. DID YOU EVER THINK YOU WOULD BE LOOKING AT MY FACE AGAIN? NO. NO, IT'S TRUE. I DIDN'T. 10 SECONDS, SAY GOODBYE. BE BRAVE, SAMIA. Cop: TIME'S UP. SHE'S A GOOD-LOOKING WOMAN. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT SHE SEES IN YOU. SO YOUR FATHER EXPLICITLY STATED TO YOU THAT HE INTENDED ON COMMITTING A FEDERAL OFFENSE, ONE THAT COULD ENDANGER THE LIVES OF HUNDREDS, EVEN THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE AND YOU FELT NO NEED TO REPORT IT? YOU DON'T KNOW MY FATHER LIKE I DO. THERE IS NO WAY HE COULD GET HIS HANDS ON A SA-18 MANPAD. SO WHY WOULD I SEND MY OWN FATHER TO PRISON FOR SOME CRIME HE COULDN'T POSSIBLY COMMIT? BECAUSE WE'RE POST-9/11, SERGEANT, AND WE CAN'T AFFORD TO TAKE ANY CHANCES. NOBODY IS TAKING ANY CHANCES, HE'S HARMLESS. HE LIKES TO TALK. HE DOES MORE THAN TALK. WE HAVE SWORN STATEMENTS FROM ASSOCIATES OF YOUR FATHER WHO DESCRIBE HIM AS AN ACTIVE PLAYER FURNISHING WEAPONS TO KNOWN TERRORISTS. THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE. HE RUNS A BUTCHER SHOP ALL DAY. HE DRIVES A CAB ALL NIGHT. HAVE YOU EVER EVEN SEEN HIM SELLING A WEAPON TO ANYONE? I'M NOT AT LIBERTY TO ADDRESS THAT, BUT I WILL TELL YOU THIS-- UNDER THE PATRIOT ACT, JUST BEING WILLING TO ABET TERRORIST ACTIVITY IS ENOUGH TO WARRANT HEAVY CRIMINAL PROSECUTION. SO, SERGEANT, BY ALLOWING YOUR FATHER TO PURSUE HIS TERRORIST ACTIVITIES, YOU'VE TURNED YOURSELF INTO AN ACCOMPLICE. WHICH CAN MEAN COURT-MARTIAL AND PRISON TIME. ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME? I SERVED IN IRAQ. THE ONLY WAY THAT YOU CAN HELP YOUR FATHER, AND YOURSELF, IS BY HELPING US. *** I'M HEADING EAST BEFORE I CROSS THROUGH THE MOUNTAINS. THE BORDER IS UNPROTECTED OUT THERE. AFTER YOU CROSS OVER, MEET ME AT THE WAY POINT I PROGRAMMED INTO THE GPS. WHEN WILL YOU GET THERE? WAIT AT THE MEETING PLACE FROM 10:00 TO MIDNIGHT. IF I DON'T SHOW UP THE FIRST NIGHT, COME BACK TO THE COORDINATES EVERY NIGHT FOR A WEEK. I DON'T MAKE IT BY THEN, I'VE EITHER BEEN CAPTURED OR EATEN BY A BEAR. EITHER WAY... GO BACK TO LOS ANGELES AND FORGET ANY OF THIS EVER HAPPENED. EASY FOR YOU TO SAY. I'LL SEE YOU IN A FEW DAYS. WE'LL CELEBRATE IN CANADA. [POLICE RADIO] IT'S CLEAN. ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO AND GET THIS TO THE TRANSLATION TEAM RIGHT AWAY. IS IT TRUE? YOU HAVE IT FOR ME? WHY ELSE WOULD I BE HERE, DAD? GIVE ME A HAND. [CAMERA CLICKS] ALLAH BE PRAISED. WHERE DID YOU GET THIS? I CAN'T TELL YOU. CAN YOU PLEASE JUST HELP ME GET IT OUT OF HERE? [CAMERA CLICKS] DAD. I... AM SO PROUD OF YOU, THAT YOU WOULD DO SUCH A THING FOR YOUR FATHER. DAD... TELL ME THE TRUTH. THIS IS THE ONLY DEAL YOU HAVE DONE SINCE WE CAME TO AMERICA, RIGHT? OF COURSE. WE WILL HAVE A GREAT CELEBRATION FOR YOUR FATHER'S RETIREMENT, HUH? SURE, PA. YES. [ENGINE STARTS] *** Hassani: SEE... HASSANI IS A MAN OF HIS WORD. MISSILE. LAUNCHER. BATTERY. IT'S THE REAL SHIT. OF COURSE IT IS. OKAY, THEN. WELL, OUR TRANSFER IS READY, I'LL PHONE IT IN NOW. HANG UP THE PHONE. WHAT? OH SHIT. THIS FUCKER IS A THIEF. THIEF? MR. DARWYN, THIS IS RIDICULOUS. I'VE DELIVERED... UHH! SHIT! AHH! THE TRADITIONAL PUNISHMENT FOR THIEVERY IN THE QU'RAN. ARE YOU FUCKING CRAZY? Salim: I'M NOT CRAZY. THIS BATTERY COOLANT UNIT IS FROM THE FUCKING '80S. THE COOLANT LASTS FOR 10 YEARS AT MOST, AFTER THAT THE BATTERY IS WORTH SHIT. WITHOUT A WORKING BC UNIT, THE WHOLE THING IS USELESS. HOW DO YOU KNOW THIS SHIT, MAN? I SPENT TWO SUMMERS TRAINING AND FIGHTING IN CHECHNYA. I'M TELLING YOU HE BETRAYED US. HE'S TRYING TO SELL US A FUCKING PAPERWEIGHT. HE'S DEAD, MAN. HE'S FUCKING DEAD. HE'S FUCKING DEAD, MAN. THIS BASTARD TRIED TO SWINDLE US. I HAD TO MAINTAIN OPERATIONAL SECURITY. COME ON, GET UP. YOU DON'T THINK THIS COMPROMISES OPERATIONAL SECURITY? LOOK AT ME. WE GOT BLOOD AND FINGERPRINTS EVERYWHERE. STUPID FUCKING-- [SCREAMS] I'M SORRY. OH, FUCK. BENNY, MINA, GET THIS MISSILE BACK TO THE HOSPITAL. MOVE. I'LL STAY AND WIPE THE PLACE DOWN. Salim: HEY, LOOK, DARWYN, I CAN HELP YOU IF YOU... SHUT THE FUCK UP. YOU'VE DONE ENOUGH. GO. LOOK, DARWYN, I'M SORRY. GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE. I'M SORRY. GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE. *** *** HEY, MAN-- HEY, WHY DIDN'T TELL ME THE BATTERY UNITS WERE MESSED WITH? ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND? WE'RE NOT GOING TO GIVE 'EM A WORKING SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILE, YOU KNOW THAT. IF YOU HAD TOLD ME THE PLAN, I WOULD HAVE KEPT SALIM OUTSIDE OR AT LEAST AWAY FROM THAT MISSILE. NEITHER ONE OF US KNEW THAT YOUR BOY CAN IDENTIFY AN OLDER MODEL BCU. IT WAS AN UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCE. UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCE GOT A MAN KILLED. DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT? HEY, LOOK, I WASN'T IN THE BUTCHER SHOP, OKAY? YOU WERE. YEAH, YOU WERE THE LAST LINE OF DEFENSE THERE. OKAY? NOW I'LL SHARE THE BLAME WITH YOU, BUT DON'T FUCKING PILE IT ALL ON MY PLATE. Darwyn: DO YOU SEE? DO YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GO AND DO THINGS BEHIND MY BACK? I CAN'T CONTROL A SITUATION IF YOU LEAVE ME IN THE DARK. FROM NOW ON, YOU HAVE TO KEEP ME IN THE LOOP ON EVERY LITTLE LAST THING YOU DO. AND YOU HAVE TO GET ME SOME SORT OF REAL INTEL ON THE SUBJECTS THAT I AM SURROUNDING MYSELF WITH, OR YOU CAN GET ANOTHER U.C. I FOUND OUT HOW YOU REALLY GOT THIS JOB. YOUR UNCLE'S DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE BUREAU, NICE. NEXT TIME YOU TALK TO HIM, TELL HIM I DON'T HAVE TIME TO BABY-SIT HIS FUCKING NEPHEW. *** Man: BE EXTRA CAREFUL WITH THE EVIDENCE, ALL RIGHT?
