 WE HAVE TO FIND OUT WHERE THE NUKES ARE COMING FROM, AND INTERCEPT THEM. *** * I CAN'T ESCAPE CRITICISM * THERE'S SOMEONE ALWAYS TALKING * * A SMILE ON MY FACE, I TURN AROUND... * NEW INTEL ON FARIK? ALL THE CHATTER HAS HIM DEAD, BUT WE'RE STILL TRYING TO GET CONFIRMATION. I'LL BELIEVE IT WHEN I SEE HIS BODY. I MADE A REQUEST TO RELOCATE GAYLE AND HER SON TO ANOTHER CITY FOR THE DURATION OF THIS CASE. MM-HM... AND IT WAS DENIED. GAYLE IS NOT A BUREAU ASSET. THAT DEPENDS ON HOW YOU DEFINE IT. SHE WAS EXPOSED TO THE CELL. THE TWO OF YOU CAN'T CHANGE YOUR PATTERN NOW. IF SHE SUDDENLY DISAPPEARS IT'LL RAISE A RED FLAG. WORRYING ABOUT HER ONLY GETS IN THE WAY OF MY JOB, RUSSELL. WELL, MAYBE IF YOU STOPPED HOLDING OUT ON ME AND WERE A LITTLE MORE FORTHCOMING WITH CRUCIAL INFORMATION THINGS MIGHT GO YOUR WAY NEXT TIME. YOU'RE USING HER TO KEEP ME IN LINE. IT'S CALLED RUNNING THE CASE. YOU KNOW I HAD A BUDDY IN THE BUREAU, OLD-TIMER IN U.C. ONE TIME, HE GOT STUCK WORKING UNDERCOVER WITH A LAME-ASS, KNOW-IT-ALL CASE AGENT. DROPPED THE BALL A FEW TIMES AND PUT MY BUDDY IN SOME SERIOUS SHIT, SO ONE DAY HE JUST FUCKING LOST IT, THREATENED TO KILL HIS CASE AGENT. MAYBE HE WAS JOKING. BUT STILL, YOU'VE GOT TO COVER YOUR ASS. SO, THE BUREAU STEPPED IN AND... MADE HIM SEE A PSYCHIATRIST EVERY DAY UNTIL FINALLY, THE PSYCHIATRIST GOT FED UP... AND ASKED HIM, "WHY ARE YOU SO STUBBORN? "WHY CAN'T YOU GIVE YOUR CASE AGENT SOME RESPECT?" AND HE SAID, "I'LL GIVE HIM SOME RESPECT..." "WHEN HE EARNS IT." [RAP MUSIC CONTINUES] *** [SPEAKS ARABIC] WELCOME, MY BROTHER. YOU ARE TRULY BACK FROM THE DEAD. WE THOUGHT WE HAD LOST YOU. ARE ALL THESE YOUR CHILDREN? MY VIRILITY IS LEGEND, BUT THAT WOULD BE BEYOND EVEN ME. I HOST AN ORPHANAGE HERE IN MY HOME. MANY ARE CHILDREN OF PARENTS WHO HAVE DIED IN THE STRUGGLE. AND IT WILL BE TOO MUCH COLLATERAL DAMAGE FOR THE PUBLIC TO DIGEST IF WE WERE ATTACKED. CHARITY BENEFITS US ALL. POOR HOST THAT I AM, I HOPE YOU WILL UNDERSTAND, THE COLONEL'S WISH TO SPEAK WITH YOU AT THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY, AND MY RUDENESS IN NOT BEING ABLE TO INTRODUCE HIM BY NAME. WE KNOW YOU WOULD LIKE TO BATHE, BUT NOTHING GOES STALE FASTER THAN INFORMATION. I HAVE BEEN DEBRIEFED IN FAR LESS AGREEABLE SURROUNDINGS. [SPEAKS ARABIC] SEEING YOU HERE, I NOW KNOW WHO TO THANK FOR MY FREEDOM. IF ANY HELP WERE GIVEN, THAT WOULD BE TREASON. AND THUS WILL NOT BE FURTHER DISCUSSED. HOW ARE YOUR INJURIES? TO BE HONEST, I'M IN A LOT OF PAIN, BUT THEY'LL HEAL. I WOULD BE INTERESTED TO LEARN HOW YOU CAME TO BE SHOT BACK IN LOS ANGELES. YOU MEAN HOW SUCH A PERFECT PLAN CAME TO RUIN UNDER MY COMMAND. ALL PLANS ARE JUST PLANS. THEY REFLECT THE WISHES OF MEN, NOT THE FINALITY OF GOD'S WILL. I HAD A LOT OF TIME TO THINK IT OVER. A WOMAN, AT THE FRINGE OF OUR GROUP, VERY BEAUTIFUL, LAPSE OF DISCIPLINE BY ONE OF MY MEN, WHO COULDN'T STAY AWAY FROM THIS KAFFIR WHORE. WHEN HE QUIT HER, AS I ORDERED, SHE BROUGHT IN THE LOCAL POLICE. SO YOU SAW THE THREAT AND YOUR FAILURE TO COMPLETELY TIE UP LOOSE ENDS WAS, IN RETROSPECT, A FATAL MISTAKE. WELL, IF I ELIMINATED THE WHORE, SOMEONE WOULD HAVE MISSED HER. I COULDN'T ELIMINATE ALL OF LOS ANGELES. AND YET YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO TRY. I GAVE MY OATH AS A MARTYR. IF MY DEVOTION OR COMPETENCE IS SUSPECT, THEN SEND ME TO BAGHDAD, GIVE ME A TRUCK BOMB, AND I'LL DRIVE IT STRAIGHT INTO THE GREEN ZONE, OR BETTER YET, A SHI'ITE NEIGHBORHOOD. THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY, MY BROTHER. YOUR RELATIONSHIPS IN CHASMA ARE TOO VALUABLE. NOW, TELL ME MORE ABOUT THAT UNFORTUNATE DAY IN LOS ANGELES. MARCHING ORDERS, MINA. YOU'RE GOING SHOPPING. SALIM, I NEED YOU TO DO SOME OVERTIME AT THE LIGHTING STUDIO TO START FABRICATION IMMEDIATELY. BASED ON THE ITEMS MINA DELIVERS TO YOU. YEAH, AND WHAT ABOUT ME, DARWYN? MORE IMPORTANTLY, WHAT ABOUT OUR GREAT LEADER? WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WHILE WE TOIL AWAY FOR JIHAD? WHAT I DO IS I TELL YOU WHAT TO DO. THIS ISN'T A DEMOCRACY. WE'RE TRYING TO PUT AN END TO THAT, REMEMBER? THEN CONSIDER IT DONE, DARWYN AL-ABD. THE REST OF YOU, GET OUT, NOW. I AM NOT YOUR SLAVE. YOU MISUNDERSTOOD THE ARABIC. IT DON'T MEAN SLAVE. IT JUST MEANS BLACK. I KNOW WHAT IT MEANS. AND THERE IS NO ROOM IN THIS UNIT FOR YOU QUESTIONING MY AUTHORITY, ESPECIALLY NOT ON THE BASIS OF YOUR OWN FUCKING COCKNEY-ARAB RACIST BULLSHIT. AAH! AAH! AAAH! YOU GOT A PROBLEM TAKING ORDERS FROM A BLACK MAN, TELL ME NOW. I WILL PUT A BULLET IN YOUR FUCKING HEAD, AND I WILL FIND SOMEONE TO REPLACE YOU. YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE THAT IS THE ONLY WAY FOR THIS OPERATION TO GO ON, AND THIS OPERATION IS THE ONLY THING THAT SHOULD MATTER TO ANY OF US. NO, I HAVE NO PROBLEM. AAH! GOOD. GOOD. [SPEAKING ARABIC] [SPEAKING ARABIC] ABDULLAH, YOU ARE A GENEROUS MAN. BUT I AM IN NO MOOD TO CELEBRATE. WHAT IS TROUBLING YOU? THEY BROKE ME, MY BROTHER. IT WAS ON THE TIP OF MY TONGUE TO TELL THEM EVERYTHING, TO GIVE UP ALL I KNOW ABOUT THE NETWORK HERE, IN THE KINGDOM. YOU, THIS HOUSE, THESE CHILDREN. IT MIGHT ALL BE GONE HAD MY RESCUE COME HALF AN HOUR LATER. IT'S PURE, PURE CHANCE THAT SAVED ME. THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS CHANCE. YOU SHOULD BE STRENGTHENED, TO RECEIVE SUCH A STRONG AND UNMISTAKABLE MESSAGE OF INTERVENTION ON YOUR BEHALF. IT WAS NOT THOSE COMMANDOS WHO RESCUED YOU. IT WAS ALLAH HIMSELF. THEY WERE BUT THE INSTRUMENTS OF HIS WILL. START WITH THE LIVER. YOU MUST REGAIN YOUR STRENGTH. [SPEAKS ARABIC] THESE ARE MY NEPHEWS, LATIF AND SARHAN. THEY MUST EAT HEARTY AS WELL. IT IS A LONG TRIP BY SEA FROM TEHRAN TO KARACHI. THESE TWO ARE GOING TO MAKE THE PICK-UP? THEY CAN NAVIGATE AN OCEAN OF WATER, AS WELL AS AN OCEAN OF SAND. JUST REMEMBER, ALL THAT MATTERS IS THE CARGO. RIGHT UNDER THE L.A. FLIGHT PATH, BABY. LET'S SEE. BBBZZZ... BOOM! MAN, I CAN DO THAT SHOOT IN MY SLEEP. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? I BET, WE CAN HIDE THE SA-18 IN THE BACK OF ONE OF THOSE. ROLL ON UP IN HERE, WE'LL BLEND RIGHT IN. WE'LL CUT A HATCH IN THE ROOF. WE'LL GET A CLEAR SHOT, MAN. NICE IDEA. IT'S ALL ABOUT TO HAPPEN, MAN. OUR LIVES ARE FINALLY GONNA MEAN SOMETHING. YOU KNOW, I REMEMBER BACK IN LOMPOC, WHEN THE LIBRARIAN GAVE ME THE QUR'AN TO READ. IT WAS LIKE THERE WAS A VOICE IN THE BOOK THAT WAS TALKING TO ME PERSONALLY, YOU KNOW. IT SAID I WASN'T SOME DUMBASS GANGBANGER, BUT I WAS A KHALIFA. GOD'S AGENT ON EARTH. IT SAID THAT GOD WAS JUST IN THIS WORLD. BUT THE GRINGOS AND THE JEWS ARE THE MASTERS, AND THE BLACKS AND THE BROWNS ARE THE SLAVES. JUSTICE REQUIRES JIHAD. THE WEAK HAVE TO TAKE THEIR RIGHTS FROM THE STRONG. AND THEY NEED WARRIORS TO DO IT. JUST LIKE YOU AND ME, BRO. WHAT'S WITH THAT MASK THE MOM'S WEARING? THAT'S NOT A MASK, CODY. SHE JUST WANTS PRIVACY, IS ALL. SHE MUST BE SWEATING LIKE CRAZY IN THOSE CLOTHES. THEY'RE MUSLIMS, STUPID. THEY COME FROM A PLACE WHERE IT'S SUPER HOT, SO THEY DON'T EVER SWEAT. YOUR SISTER IS RIGHT, CODY. THEY ARE MUSLIMS, BUT IT'S NOT TRUE THAT THEY DON'T SWEAT. THAT'S JUST SILLY. *** I FOUNT 'EM, MINA, I FOUND 'EM. ARE WE GOING ON A PICNIC? NOT TODAY. MAYBE IF YOU'RE VERY GOOD, I'LL TAKE BOTH OF YOU WITH ME WHEN THE TIME COMES. COME ON. WHAT'S THAT FOR, MINA? HERE. IT'S FOR YOUR MOM'S TRIP TO PALM SPRINGS. IT'S PERFECT. COME ON. [GERMAN ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] [SPEAKS GERMAN] *** THE ACETONE SPRAYER. THE TECHS TELL US IT'LL NEUTRALIZE THE RDX WITHOUT TIPPING OFF THE EXPLOSIVES CHICK. I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT. HEY, WHAT WAS... WHAT WAS THAT TRIP TODAY ALL ABOUT AT THE BEACH? WAS THAT JUST A COUPLE OF JIHADIS GETTING A TAN, OR-- SALIM MANAGED TO GET THE SA-18 WORKING AGAIN. SON OF A BITCH. YEAH. AND I GOT INSTRUCTIONS TO RECON THAT LOCATION FOR POSSIBLE ATTACK ON A COMMERCIAL FLIGHT. NOW, HOW DOES THAT JIBE WITH YOUR NUCLEAR SCENARIO? I DON'T KNOW YET. PROBABLY COORDINATED ATTACKS. BUT STILL NO DATE. NOTHING. THE URL'S KEEP COMING AND THINGS ARE RAMPING UP, SO I'M BETTING IT'S SOON. WELL, HEY, THANKS FOR KEEPING ME IN THE LOOP. IT'S MY JOB, ISN'T IT? [DOORBELL] I HOPE I'M NOT INTERRUPTING. IT'S A WELCOME INTERRUPTION. BUT IT'S PRETTY LATE. I'M NOT STALKING YOU, HONEST. IT'S, UMMM-- WELL, YOU'RE NEVER HOME AND-- I WAS IN THE AREA, AND I SAW YOUR BIKE. SO-- SO, ARE YOU THE TYPICAL H1 VISA TYPE, PUTTING IN THE LONG HOURS ABROAD? IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR? A TYPICAL GUY? APPARENTLY, IT'S WHAT MY PARENTS ARE LOOKING FOR. OH! YOU'RE GETTING PRESSURE ABOUT THIS TOO? SO MANY CALLS. I MEAN, IT GOT EVEN WORSE ONCE I TOLD THEM HOW DEVOUT YOU ARE. I BROKE MY PARENTS' HEARTS WHEN I DIDN'T GO TO MED SCHOOL. THEY'RE BOTH DOCTORS. YOU'RE THE ANSWER TO THEIR PRAYERS, WHEN THEY REMEMBER 'EM. SO, IF WE REPORT THAT WE TRIED AGAIN, MAYBE THAT'LL AT LEAST GET THEM OFF OF OUR BACKS. WHAT DO YOU HAVE IN MIND? A SOCCER GAME? THAT WOULD BE COOL, YES. BUT... I HAVE A DIFFERENT IDEA. [GERMAN ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] [SPEAKS GERMAN] ASSALAMU ALAIKUM, BROTHERS. I AM ASKING ALLAH TO FORGIVE YOU FOR TAKING IT UP THE ASS FROM YOUR BOYFRIEND NEXT TO YOU. AAH! AAH! [SPEAKS GERMAN] AAAH! AAH! [SPEAKS GERMAN] *** *** [PRAYING IN ARABIC] YOU BROUGHT ME TO HEAR AN IMAM? IT'S NOT JUST ANY IMAM, IT'S SAFIR HAMDI. MILLIONS OF MUSLIMS WATCH HIM FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD. HE JUST RELOCATED TO AMERICA FROM OVERSEAS. THANK YOU. *** [APPLAUSE] [SINGING IN ARABIC] MANY OF YOU KNOW I'M A MEDICAL DOCTOR, AND MANY OF YOU HAVE SUPPORTED A VERY SPECIAL CAUSE. THE ONGOING REBUILDING OF THE AL-SHAYANI CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL IN DORA, A MIXED SUBURB OF BAGHDAD. THE DISEASE, VIOLENCE, AND BLOODSHED THAT AFFLICT OUR YOUNGSTERS DO NOT RECOGNIZE SECTARIAN BOUNDARIES AND SO THE HOSPITAL WILL TREAT ALL YOUNGSTERS WITHOUT REGARD TO WHETHER THEY'RE SUNNI OR SHI'A. IN MY VISION, THE HOSPITAL SHINES AS A PLACE WHERE STAFF FROM THE TWO SECTS CAN WORK AND HEAL TOGETHER IN AN EFFORT TO OVERCOME THE VIOLENCE BETWEEN THEM, TO EMPHASIZE THAT WE ARE NOT SO DIFFERENT, AFTER ALL. WHEN YOU SEND YOUR DONATION TO THE HOSPITAL, YOU ARE REALLY SUPPORTING AN END TO THE SHARED MENTAL DELUSION THAT KEEPS US APART. THE DELUSION IS CALLED THE NARCISSISM OF MINOR DIFFERENCES. THIS IS THE HATRED WE FEEL WHEN OUR NEIGHBORS ARE SO MUCH LIKE OURSELVES, BUT JUST DIFFERENT ENOUGH THAT WE MUST HATE THEM. BUT IF WE SUNNI AND SHI'A WORK TOGETHER, AND NOT BLAME EACH OTHER, THEN WE WILL FINALLY ACHIEVE THE SELF-RESPECT THAT WILL ALLOW OUR PEOPLE TO MOVE FORWARD. WHAT'S WITH YOU? YOU ACTED LIKE I INSULTED YOU SOMEHOW BY BRINGING YOU HERE. NO, IT'S NOT ME YOU'RE INSULTING. IT'S OUR FAITH. YOU'RE SAYING THAT HAMDI ISN'T A GOOD MUSLIM? HEY! IMAM! HOW LONG BEFORE SOMEONE BLOWS UP YOUR PRECIOUS HOSPITAL? THE JIHADI BLEW IT UP ONCE. THEN YOU SHOULD HEED THE MESSAGE, IDOLATOR. WHY DO YOU CALL ME THAT? I WORSHIP NO IDOLS. BECAUSE YOU INVITE WORSHIP OF YOURSELF AT THE EXPENSE OF THE WORDS OF THE PROPHET. BROTHER, I AM ONLY TRYING TO BRING PEOPLE TO GOD. THESE IGNORANT PEOPLE VENERATE YOU. JUST AS THE SHI'A BROTHERS VENERATE ALI AL-HUSSEIN OVER THE SHARI'AH, OVER THE TRUE WORD. AH, I SEE WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. YOUR PREJUDICE IS SHOWING. HEY, YOU NEED TO APOLOGIZE. APOLOGIZE? FOR WHAT? BECAUSE I ABHOR PRACTICES THAT MAKE PROSTITUTES OF GOOD MUSLIM WOMEN? YOU SPEAK OF MUT'AH. I SPECIFICALLY CONDEMN ANY FORM OF TEMPORARY MARRIAGE, ESPECIALLY FOR MONEY. BUT YOU PREACH TOLERANCE TOWARD THOSE FUCKING SHI'ITE HERETICS WHO PROMOTE THESE PRACTICES. I FEEL SORRY FOR YOU, BROTHER. I TRULY DO. A KEY MESSAGE IN THE QUR'AN IS THAT MUSLIMS SHOULD NOT JUDGE OTHERS. THEY SHOULD ONLY IMPROVE THEMSELVES. ONLY GOD JUDGES. DO NOTHING. SHUKRAN! SHUKRAN! HOW COULD YOU SAY THOSE THINGS TO HIM? YOU TOTALLY EMBARRASSED ME. I JUST TOLD THE TRUTH. OH, YOU ARE SO FULL OF SHIT, SALIM. YOU KNOW WHAT? FINE, FINE, GO FREAK OUT, OVER SHI'ITE TEMPORARY MARRIAGE FROM THE 7TH CENTURY. YOU KNOW IF YOU TOOK THAT STANCE A THOUSAND YEARS AGO, IT WOULD MEAN THAT YOU WERE A MAN OF CONVICTION. TODAY, ALL IT MEANS IS THAT YOU'RE A FUCKING NUT. NOW, I SEE THE REAL YOU, THE ONE WHOSE MOUTH IS IN THE GUTTER, THE ONE WHO ISN'T BOTHERED BY LEGALIZED PROSTITUTION. WHY AM I NOT SURPRISED, SARAH? WHAT GOOD MUSLIM MAN WOULD EVER MARRY YOU? YOU TALK WESTERN, YOU DRESS WESTERN, AND I'LL BET YOU FUCK WESTERN TOO. YOU'LL NEVER KNOW. YOUR TELEVANGELIST'S A HERETIC! AND YOU ARE A WHORE! A GAHBAH! I WOULDN'T TAKE YOU IF YOU WERE THE LAST WOMAN ON EARTH! *** IT'S NOT TOO LATE TO CHANGE YOUR MIND. WE COULD GO PICK UP MARQUES, PUT YOU BOTH ON A BUS TO BAKERSFIELD TONIGHT. OR YOU COULD HOP ON A PLANE ANYWHERE YOU WANT TO GO. YOUR BOSS SAID WE'D BE SAFER IF WE STAYED IN TOWN. HE'S NOT MY BOSS. WHATEVER, DARWYN. JUST BE HONEST WITH ME, ALL RIGHT? DOES IT MAKE THINGS SAFER? YES OR NO? *** MIYAN AZIZ, ARE YOU GONNA STAND THERE ALL NIGHT WITH A BAG OVER YOUR HEAD OR ARE YOU GONNA JOIN ME FOR SOME TEA? FARIK! YOU'RE THE ONE WHO HAD ME KIDNAPPED, DRAGGED FROM MY HOUSE LIKE A CRIMINAL? KIDNAPPED? SOMEONE IS GIVING YOU THE WRONG IMPRESSION. YOU ARE A VERY HONORED GUEST. COME. I'LL POUR YOU SOME TEA. THESE PRETENSES ARE INSULTING. TELL ME, WHAT MAKES ME SUCH AN HONORED GUEST? THAT WE'RE GOOD FRIENDS? THAT WE BOTH FOUGHT AGAINST THE RUSSIANS TOGETHER? MY NICE TIE? NO. NO, OF COURSE NOT. IT'S BECAUSE I'M AN ENGINEER IN CHASMA. AND MY ANSWER IS STILL THE SAME, FARIK, EVEN WITH YOU ASKING. IF IT'S A QUESTION OF MONEY-- IT'S NOT MONEY. IT'S THE FUTURE OF ISLAM. IF I DO WHAT YOU ASK, IF I GIVE YOU THE FUEL RODS AND YOU USE THEM, YOU HAVE JUST OPENED A DOOR FOR THE WEST TO DROP A NUCLEAR BOMB ON MECCA. YOU KID YOURSELF, AZIZ. YOU THINK THEIR MISSILES AREN'T POINTED THERE NOW? ALREADY THE AMERICANS AND THE ZIONIST DOGS HAVE BEGUN THE PROPAGANDA FOR A PREEMPTIVE STRIKE. WE MUST STRIKE FIRST. WE MUST BE HEARD. YOU'RE ESCALATING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION, FARIK. AND I REFUSE TO BE A PART OF IT. FORGIVE MY LIMP. IT'S THE PRICE OF HAVING THE FAITH IN ALLAH TO FIGHT IN THE FRONT LINES, PERHAPS YOU REMEMBER. JUST BECAUSE I DON'T WEAR A GUN TO WORK, DOES NOT MAKE ME ANY LESS DEVOUT. WE ALSO NEED TO STRENGTHEN OUR COMMUNITIES FROM THE INSIDE. I'M GLAD I COULD BE OF HELP TO MAKE SURE YOU SURVIVED TO DO SO. I WILL NEVER FORGET THAT YOU SAVED MY LIFE IN AFGHANISTAN, BUT THIS CANNOT BE HOW YOU EXPECT THAT DEBT TO BE PAID. CAN'T IT? LOOK AT US STANDING HERE. AND ALL THE THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED TO MAKE IT SO. I SAVED YOUR LIFE FIGHTING THE SOVIETS, SO THAT YOU COULD LIVE TO WORK IN A NUCLEAR FACILITY. I ENDURED CONFINEMENT, TORTURE. WAS SENT BACK TO MY NATIVE LAND FOR EXECUTION, AND SURVIVED AND ESCAPED, SO THAT I COULD BE JOINED WITH YOU AT THE EXACT SAME MOMENT YOUR FAITH HAS FALTERED. NOW, HOW COULD ALL THAT BE ACCOMPLISHED BY ANYTHING ELSE BUT THE WILL OF GOD? TELL ME, IS IT THE WILL OF GOD TO INITIATE THE DEATHS OF MILLIONS OF OUR OWN? DID I TELL YOU, AZIZ, THAT I HAD A DAUGHTER BORN TO ME SINCE WE LAST SAW EACH OTHER? CONGRATULATIONS. OH, I SHOULD EXTEND THE SAME TO YOU. CHILDREN, YOU KNOW, THEY ARE A CONSTANT SOURCE OF WORRY, ESPECIALLY DAUGHTERS. WONDERING WHERE THEY ARE, IF THEY'RE SAFE. YOUR DAUGHTER, SHE'S LOVELY. LITTLE ON THE PLUMP SIDE. I WOULD KEEP HER AWAY FROM SWEETS. MAYBE SHE SHOULD COME AND VISIT WITH US. I CAN MAKE SURE SHE GETS SOME PROPER EXERCISE. OF COURSE, SUCH A VISIT WILL BE STRICTLY AT YOUR DISCRETION. * TOO MUCH GOING ON * TO PROVE WHAT'S SO MUCH RIGHT OR WHAT'S WRONG * * TOO MUCH GOING ON AAH! OH! I'M SORRY. DID I SCARE YOU? I SHOULD'VE TIGHTENED THE LID. OH, IT'S TOO BAD. IT WAS A PRETTY COLOR. AND I WANTED TO GET MY NAILS DONE. AH, LOOK, MINA, UM... IT'S REALLY GREAT TO SEE YOU AGAIN, BUT I'M REALLY BUSY AND IN FACT I'M, UM, BOOKED SOLID ALL DAY. I'LL WAIT FOR YOU. WELL, I GUESS I COULD SQUEEZE YOU IN NOW. I HAVEN'T DONE THIS IN AGES. WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST? UMM... HERE. THESE LOOK QUITE BEAUTIFUL. I LIKE THIS ONE, THE TULIPS. GREAT. IT'S FUNNY, YOU KNOW. I STILL FEEL NAKED WITHOUT MY WEDDING RING. ARE YOU MARRIED? I USED TO BE. LIKE YOU. HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT? I CAN TELL. SCIENTISTS SAY THAT MARRIAGE PRODUCES PHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES, BUT I THINK IT GOES DEEPER THAN THAT. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? IN ISLAM, MARRIAGE IS THE HUMAN STATE CLOSEST TO GODLINESS. IT'S A METAPHOR OF UNITY WITH GOD, EXPRESSING OUR TOTAL IMMERSION IN THE ALMIGHTY. REALLY? SO, WHEN YOUR HUSBAND GETS DRUNK EVERY NIGHT AND TAKES A SWING AT YOU, WHAT'S THAT A METAPHOR FOR? LACK OF FAITH. SO, YOU SAID YOU WERE MARRIED BEFORE. WHAT HAPPENED? HE DIED. SORRY. THE OTHER GUYS IN MY LIFE UP TO THEN, THEY ALL USED ME OR ABUSED ME OR CHEATED ON ME. MY HUSBAND WAS TRULY DIFFERENT. HE CARED FOR MY SOUL, NOT JUST MY BODY. YOU DON'T NEED A MUSLIM FOR THAT. MAYBE, BUT THE AVERAGE MUSLIM MAN DOESN'T SLEEP AROUND. OR IF HE DOES, HE PAYS FOR IT. ADULTERERS ARE TREATED VERY HARSHLY. ISLAMIC LAW SPECIFIES STONING TO DEATH. SEEMS A BIT EXTREME. IT IS EXTREME. BUT MARRIAGE IS TOO IMPORTANT. MY KIDS WILL LOVE MY NEW NAILS. YOU'RE A MOM? AN AU PAIR, A NANNY, BUT YOU KNOW HOW IT IS. I SPEND MORE TIME WITH THESE KIDS THAN THEIR PARENTS DO. NOW, ANYTIME YOU'D LIKE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT ISLAM, I'M ALWAYS HERE. THANKS, THANKS A LOT. [BANGING] YO, SALIM? THIS CONTAINMENT ROOM? WALLS ARE PRETTY THICK, YEAH? OFFHAND, I'D SAY SIX INCHES OR SO OF STEEL COVERED WITH A COUPLE OF FEET OF CONCRETE. AND THAT'S PROTECTION AGAINST RADIATION AND SHIT, RIGHT? THERE ARE THREE KINDS OF RADIATION. ALPHA, GAMMA, BETA. THIS ROOM IS DESIGNED TO HANDLE ALL THREE. DOES IT PROTECT AGAINST... ATTITUDE? EXCUSE ME? I JUST WANTED TO KNOW IF IT PROTECTS AGAINST ATTITUDE. BECAUSE RIGHT NOW YOU'RE EMITTING A TOXIC DOSE, BRO. ARE YOU MOCKING ME? BECAUSE I'M STARTING TO GET SICK OF YOUR JOKES, AND YOUR LACK OF SERIOUSNESS. COME ON MAN, JIHAD CAN BE FUN. JIHAD IS NOT FUN. HEY, STAND DOWN, YOU TWO. YOUR JIHAD CAN BE FUN AND YOURS CAN BE MISERABLE. HEY, COME ON, DUDE. WHAT'S BUGGING YOU? IS IT GIRL TROUBLE? IF IT WERE... I WOULD BE SURE TO ASK YOUR ADVICE, WITH ALL THE EXPERIENCE YOU'VE HAD, FUCKING DIRTY WHORES, BEFORE YOU FOUND GOD! HEY, BACK THE FUCK OFF, MAN, BACK THE FUCK OFF. YOU'RE RIGHT, I'M SORRY. I SPOKE OUT OF TURN. FUCK! I'M A BLOODY WRECK. I WENT THIS WEEK AND I SAW SAFIR HAMDI, THE TELEVISION IMAM. YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE WORSHIPPING THAT SHI'ITE FUCKING APOLOGIST. AND WHO KNOWS HOW MANY MORE TUNE IN TO THIS GUY ON CABLE OR SATELLITE... THEY'RE DILUTING THE MUSLIM PURITY JUST BY WATCHING. WAS YOUR MUSLIM PURITY DILUTED BY WATCHING IT? RELAX! FORGET ABOUT THE TELEVANGELIST. WE'VE GOT BIGGER TARGETS COMING OUR WAY. WHAT THE HELL! CLOSE THE DOOR. WE NEED TO TALK. YEAH, GOD DAMN RIGHT, WE DO. YOU KNOW, WHEN I AGREED TO HELP YOU OUT, I DIDN'T THINK THAT OSAMA BIN DUTCH CHICK WOULD BE ABLE TO WALTZ INTO MY JOB ANY TIME SHE GOD DAMN FELT LIKE IT. JUST RELAX, OK, WE HAVE THIS WOMAN UNDER MULTIPLE LEVELS OF SURVEILLANCE, 24/7. WE CAN STEP IN AT ANY TIME. NOW, WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IF SHE BUMPS INTO YOU AGAIN IS JUST ENGAGE HER, MAKE SOME SMALL TALK, BUT REMEMBER EVERYTHING SHE SAYS TO YOU, OK. EVEN THE TINIEST PIECE OF INFORMATION THAT YOU BRING BACK CAN HELP THIS CASE... AND DARWYN. YEAH? WELL IF IT WERE UP TO DARWYN, I WOULDN'T EVEN BE DOING THIS. HE TOLD YOU WE'VE HAD WORDS ABOUT THIS? HE DIDN'T HAVE TO, OK? HE WANTED ME TO GO OUT OF TOWN, BUT I TALKED HIM OUT OF IT. [SIGHS] YES, THIS ISN'T THE FIRST DIFFERENCE OF OPINION THAT WE'VE HAD. YOU SEE, YOUR BOYFRIEND THINKS HE CAN DO WHATEVER HE WANTS, BUT HE CAN'T. YOU KNOW, I SAW WHAT HE DID BEFORE. I WAS THERE. HE SAVED MY SON AND A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE TOO. SO, IF I WERE YOU, I WOULD TRUST HIS INSTINCTS. YOU KNOW WHAT? I JUST HAD A THOUGHT THAT MIGHT HELP US BOTH. SINCE YOU'RE IN THE PICTURE NOW, MAYBE YOU WOULDN'T MIND ACTING AS A GO-BETWEEN. YOU KNOW, KINDA KEEP THE LINES OPEN BETWEEN HIM AND ME AND JUST LET HIM TALK ABOUT THE CASE, AND LET ME KNOW IF ANYTHING ELSE COMES UP. YOU MEAN SPY ON DARWYN? NO, NOT SPYING ON HIM, OK. YOU MISUNDERSTOOD ME. NO, I DIDN'T MISUNDERSTAND YOU. I'M SORRY, DOES IT LOOK LIKE I HAVE "FBI BITCH" TATTOOED ON MY ASS? THE ONLY REASON WHY I GOT INTO THIS WAS TO WATCH DARWYN'S BACK AND NOW YOU WANT ME TO GO BEHIND HIS BACK? NO FUCKING WAY! *** GET OUT! *** [SINGING IN ARABIC] [PRAYING IN ARABIC] ANOTHER DOZEN BODIES WERE DISCOVERED TODAY IN BAGHDAD, HANDCUFFED AND EXECUTED, IN A STRUGGLE IN WHICH TWO WORDS HAVE BECOME ONE, SECTARIAN STRIFE. IT'S MY LIFE'S WORK TO BREAK APART THESE TWO WORDS FOREVER. AND TO THAT END, I'M GOING TO LEAD A GROUP OF MY FELLOW SUNNIS TO PRAY ISHA WITH OUR BROTHER MUSLIMS AT THE SHI'ITE MOSQUE IN CULVER CITY, CALIFORNIA THIS FRIDAY NIGHT. WE WILL MAKE AN EXAMPLE TO THE ENTIRE MUSLIM WORLD THAT RECONCILIATION IS POSSIBLE. AAH. [GASPS] OH. COME ON. AAH. THANKS. HEY, YOU'RE GONNA BENCH THAT KIND OF WEIGHT, NEXT TIME, ASK FOR A SPOT, BRO. JASON. SAM. I'M ALL DONE HERE, HOW ABOUT YOU? ACTUALLY, I GOT A FEW MORE IN ME, BELIEVE IT OR NOT. OK. LATER. I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU HERE BEFORE. I'VE SEEN YOU. I'M GONNA STEAM. *** [WHISPERS] FUCK. FUCK. CALL ME? AAAH! [SCREAMS] [SPEAKING ARABIC] [SCREAMING] *** SALAAM ALAIKUM. WU ALAIKUM AS-SALAAM. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE, MAN? I, UM... I NEED TO TALK TO ONE OF YOUR HOMEBOY BUDDIES. FIRST OF ALL, THEY AIN'T MY BUDDIES ANYMORE. SECOND, THEY'RE MIGHTY SELECTIVE ABOUT WHO THEY TALK TO. I NEED TO BUY A GUN. A GUN? WHAT KIND OF A GUN? WHAT KIND IS NONE OF YOUR FUCKING BUSINESS. YO. IT IS MY FUCKING BUSINESS, HOMES? THIS IS COMING FROM DARWYN? NO, NO, IT'S JUST THAT... YOU KNOW, SHIT'S GONNA HIT THE FAN SOON. AND DARWYN'S GOT A GUN, SO... I FIGURED I SHOULD GET ONE TOO, JUST IN CASE. LOOK, I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE GETTING YOURSELF INTO, BUT YOU NEED TO STAY FOCUSED, MAN. IF YOU GET CAUGHT BUYING A GUN, YOU BRING DOWN THE COPS, YOU COULD FUCK UP OUR WHOLE OPERATION. SO, YOU'RE SAYING YOU WON'T HELP ME. AFTER EVERYTHING WE'VE BEEN THROUGH. EVERYTHING WE'RE ABOUT TO GO THROUGH. LOOK, SALIM, WHY WOULD I DO ANYTHING THAT COULD BLOW MY BEST CHANCE OF MEETING MY 72 VIRGIN HYNAS IN PARADISE? MORE IMPORTANTLY, WHY WOULD YOU? [BELL] I THINK THIS WILL BE A GOOD CHOICE, OLD WEST MODEL REPLICA. ACTUALLY SHOOTS .22 CALIBER BLANKS, MADE FROM FORGED GERMAN STEEL, NOT POT METAL. IT'S GOT A SMOOTH ACTION, LIKE A REAL GUN. I HEARD THEY'RE TAKING THESE OFF THE MARKET. TRUE, TRUE, YOU'RE GETTING IN JUST UNDER THE WIRE. THEY FIGURED OUT YOU CAN CONVERT THE BARREL OF THESE THINGS TO WORK WITH REAL BULLETS. IF YOU HAD THE RIGHT TOOLS. WHAT YOU WIND UP WITH CAN'T RIGHTLY BE CALLED A GUN, ANYWAY. MIGHT LAST FIFTY ROUNDS, TOP, BEFORE IT BLOWS UP IN YOUR HAND, BUT, HEY, FOR 69.95 AND NO BACKGROUND CHECK, YOU CAN'T REALLY COMPLAIN, CAN YOU? GUESS NOT. [CELLPHONE RINGING] YEAH, BENNY, WHAT'S UP? DID YOU GREEN LIGHT SALIM TO TAKE SOMEBODY OUT? LIKE HELL! HE WAS JUST HERE. ASKING ME TO GIVE HIM A PISTOLA. ALL RIGHT. THANKS FOR THE INFORMATION, I'LL HANDLE IT. YOU'VE REACHED SALIM, LEAVE A MESSAGE. FUCK! *** SALIM! [CELLPHONE RINGING] DARWYN! LOOK, WE GOT AN EMERGENCY. SALIM'S GONE AWOL. HE'S ALREADY TRIED TO ACQUIRE A WEAPON. HE'S BEEN RIGHT ON THE FUCKING EDGE, MAN. WE MIGHT HAVE TO PULL HIM IN. ALL RIGHT, HANG ON A SECOND. LET ME JUST GET WITH THE AGENTS IN THE FIELD. I'LL GET RIGHT BACK TO YOU, OK? [CELLPHONE RINGING] WHAT DO YOU HAVE? SALIM VISITED A GUN STORE ON WASHINGTON BOULEVARD, BUT HE DID NOT FILE A FIREARMS APPLICATION. THEN HE WENT TO THE LIGHTING FACTORY, STAYED THERE SEVERAL HOURS AND THEN HE LEFT. HOW DOES HE SEEM TO YOU? SEEMS REAL EDGY, MAN. SOMETHING'S EATING HIM UP FROM THE INSIDE. WELL, I HAVE BEEN STAYING ON MI5'S BACK ABOUT SALIM AND... FINALLY, I GOT SOME NEW INTEL THAT MIGHT BE RELEVANT. IT SEEMS HE CAUSED QUITE A SCANDAL IN THE LONDON IRAQI COMMUNITY OVER A LITTLE LOVE AFFAIR THAT HE GOT INTO, APPARENTLY SOME HUSH MONEY WAS PAID, AND HE WAS SHIPPED OFF TO A FUNDAMENTALIST MADRASSA IN TORONTO. IT'S JUST LIKE SENDING A FUCKED-UP AMERICAN KID TO MILITARY SCHOOL, THESE PEOPLE ARE ULTRA CONSERVATIVE. CAN'T JUST GET IT ON WITH THE GIRL NEXT DOOR, MAN. YEAH, WELL, IN THIS CASE, IT WAS THE BOY NEXT DOOR. DARWYN? TELL YOUR GUYS TO GET BACK TO ME WITH THE LOCATION OF SALIM, AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. *** [CELLPHONE RINGING] RUSSELL, WHAT HAVE YOU GOT FOR ME? HE'S AT THE SHI'ITE MOSQUE IN CULVER CITY. SON OF A BITCH! [TIRES SCREECH] [SPEAKING ARABIC] I FEEL TRULY WELCOME HERE, AS IF A GREAT PERSONAL QUEST HAS BEGUN, A QUEST FOR PEACE IN ISLAM. PEACE WITHIN THE SOULS OF ALL OF US. DEAR BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN ISLAM, I ASK YOU TO REMEMBER THE WORDS OF GOD, OF THE HOLY QUR'AN, AND HOLD FAST, ALL OF YOU TOGETHER, TO THE ROPE OF GOD, AND BE NOT DIVIDED AMONG YOURSELVES. CAN ANY COMMANDMENT BE CLEARER? GOD HAS ASKED MUSLIMS TO UNITE AND NOT ALLOW THEMSELVES TO BE TORN INTO SECTS AND YET THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT WE HAVE DONE. WE CALL OURSELVES SUNNI OR SHI'A. AND IN MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD, MUSLIMS ARE KILLING EACH OTHER JUST OVER THESE DIFFERENT LABELS. [SPEAKS ARABIC] I ASK YOU TO THINK, WHO OF THE HOLY PROPHETS, SALLA ALLAHU ALAIHI WA SALLAM, CALLED THEMSELVES SUNNI OR SHI'A? WE BOTH BELIEVE IN THE ANGELS ON JUDGMENT DAY. I'M GONNA FUCKING KILL YOU, I WILL. YOU'RE ABOUT TO BRING A TON OF HEAT DOWN ON THE REST OF US. THINK IT THROUGH. THE POLICE GRAB YOUR ASS, YOU'LL RUIN THE ENTIRE OPERATION, AND THAT IS THE ONLY THING THAT SHOULD MATTER TO YOU RIGHT NOW. KILLING THIS HERETIC IS WORTH IT. SALIM, LISTEN TO ME. I SPOKE TO SOME PEOPLE IN THE BROTHERHOOD BACK IN THE UK. I KNOW ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED. BEFORE YOU LEFT LONDON, WHY YOUR FAMILY SENT YOU AWAY, I KNOW EVERYTHING. GOING TO SHOOT ME? YOU KNOW I THINK YOU'LL MIND IT. YOU CAN BLOW HAMDI AWAY, BUT IT WILL NOT CHANGE WHO YOU ARE. AH! AAAH! AAH. AAH.
