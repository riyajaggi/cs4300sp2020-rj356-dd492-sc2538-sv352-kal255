RUSSELL MADE ME GO TO THIS MEETING WITH MINA AND I'VE BEEN STUCK WITH THE PSYCHO FOR HOURS. [GASPS] *** BISHOP AND VAN DER HULST HAVE BEEN IN THERE FOREVER. I WISH WE HAD ANOTHER TEAM HERE. THIS CASE HAS TOO MANY DAMN SUBJECTS. YEAH, WELL, AT LEAST WE HAVE AN AGENT INSIDE. SHIT! MINA! YOU SCARED ME. SORRY, I-- UH, I GUESS I SHOULDN'T BE CURSING IN A MOSQUE. ASSALAM ALAIKUM, SISTER. OH, HI. I SAW YOU IN THE MEETING TONIGHT, YOU'RE NEW TO THE GROUP. WHY DIDN'T YOU INTRODUCE YOURSELF? NO, UM... I WAS JUST CURIOUS. I'M NOT REALLY A MUSLIM. YOU KNOW, THAT'S HOW I STARTED MY JOURNEY, HONEY. CURIOSITY. I NEVER IMAGINED... I'D ACTUALLY ONE DAY EMBRACE ISLAM. BUT ALLAH GUIDES WHOM HE WILL TO THE STRAIGHT PATH. YOU KNOW, THE BOOK STORE IS STILL OPEN. THEY'VE GOT A WHOLE COLLECTION OF MATERIALS WRITTEN SPECIFICALLY FOR NON-MUSLIMS TO INTRODUCE THEM TO THE FAITH. YEAH, I DON'T THINK I CAN... COME ON. IT'LL JUST TAKE A MINUTE. OKAY, SURE. JUST FOR A MINUTE. WHO WERE YOU TALKING TO? UM...I WAS JUST CALLING MY BABYSITTER TO CHECK UP ON MARCUS. HE'S...SLEEPING LIKE AN ANGEL. SO YOUR BABYSITTER KNOWS YOU WENT TO THE ISLAMIC CENTER TONIGHT. YEAH, YEAH. I... I WAS JUST TELLING HER WHAT A GREAT TIME I HAD AT THE WOMEN'S...GROUP. THANKS FOR TAKING ME. WE SHOULD GO AGAIN SOMETIME. I'M AFRAID THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN. [GAYLE GASPS] DON'T SCREAM. I DON'T WANNA USE THIS, ESPECIALLY IN A SACRED PLACE. WHAT DO YOU WANT? WE'RE GOING FOR A DRIVE. I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE WITH YOU ! [GAYLE GASPS] IF WE DON'T WALK OUT OF HERE IN THE NEXT FIVE MINUTES, TOGETHER MY BROTHERS WILL BE PAYING A VISIT TO MARCUS. [GASPS] PLEASE, MINA. JESUS! DON'T DO THIS. [GASPS] GET MOVING. OKAY. THIS WAY, OUT THE BACK DOOR. Agent: WHAT DO WE DO NOW, AGENT RUSSELL? Russell: [SIGHS] WE WAIT FOR THE CALL. [CLICKING] [PHONE RINGING] RUSSELL. Agent: THIS IS D.S. WE GOT THE GREEN LIGHT. YES, SIR! GOT IT. OKAY. RAISE H.R.T. AND SWAT TEAMS TELL THEM TO GET READY TO MOVE. [STARTS ENGINE] WHERE ARE WE GOING? GET ON THE 10 EAST. I'LL TELL YOU WHERE TO GET OFF. MASHALLAH, BROTHERS. EXCELLENT WORK. KARRAR, ISN'T IT TIME YOU TELL US THE PLAN? YOU'RE RIGHT. IT'S TIME. Karrar: DARWYN AND BENITO WILL DRIVE TO L.A.X. WITH THE SUITCASE. YOU WILL GIVE THE SUITCASE TO LITTLE RENZO, BENITO'S FRIEND. HE WILL PUT IT ON A FLIGHT 365 TO LONDON WHICH DEPART AT 8:10 PM. BY THAT TIME YOU TWO WILL BE AT VISTA DEL MAR BEACH WITH THE SA-18. Benito: WHEN THE PLANE FLIES OVERHEAD THE MISSILE LOCKS ONTO THE JET ENGINES AND BOOM. KILLING EVERYONE ON BOARD. TURNING NUCLEAR FUEL RODS INTO RADIOACTIVE DUST. TO BE SCATTERED BY THE WIND OVER SANTA MONICA... VENICE BEACH... THE PALISADES... WEST L.A. WHAT ABOUT ME? YOU AND I WILL BE AT THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL. Karrar: AT EXACTLY 8:17 WHEN OUR BROTHER DISPENSE GOD'S JUSTICE FROM THE WEST, WE WILL DETONATE THE COOLER. AND THE DIRTY BOMB WILL DISPENSE GOD'S JUSTICE FROM THE EAST. SIMULTANEOUS COORDINATED ATTACKS. BLANKET THE CITY IN NUCLEAR FALLOUT. THE IMMEDIATE DEATH TOLL WILL BE IN THE THOUSANDS BUT THAT NUMBER WILL RISE WITH RADIATION POISONING. CANCER, BIRTH DEFECTS. AND THE ECONOMIC DAMAGES WILL BE CATASTROPHIC. THE REAL ESTATE LOSSES ALONE WILL BE TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. THIS 4 OF JULY WILL BE OUR INDEPENDENCE DAY. ALLAHU AKBAR. Others: ALLAHU AKBAR. [MAN SPEAKS ARABIC] TODAY IS THE DAY WE HAVE LONG PREPARED FOR, MY FRIEND. THE GREAT FITNA. THE CHAOS THAT WILL CONSUME THE WEST. A NUCLEAR ATTACK ON LOS ANGELES WILL NOT GO UNANSWERED. WHATEVER THE RESPONSE IT WILL ONLY STRENGTHEN OUR CAUSE. I SHALL MISS THE CHILDREN. I HAVE BEEN THEIR WALI FOR MANY YEARS. THEY ARE LIKE MY OWN FLESH AND BLOOD. IF THE AMERICANS ARE STUPID ENOUGH TO ATTACK A BUILDING FULL OF ORPHANS, THESE CHILDREN BECOME MARTYRS AND WE WILL HAVE A GREAT P.R. VICTORY TO RALLY EVEN MORE BELIEVERS TO THE WORLDWIDE JIHAD. *** Agent: WE'VE IDENTIFIED A SERIES OF UNDERGROUND TUNNELS THAT LEAD DIRECTLY TO THE MAIN FACILITY. ALPHA TEAM WILL ENTER VIA THE SUBTERRANEAN PASSAGEWAY, WHILE BRAVO TEAM WILL BE AIRLIFTED ONTO THE ROOF AND FIELD TEAMS WILL ENGAGE THE PERIMETER. ALL TEAMS WILL CONVERGE ON THE MAIN CHAMBER WHERE THE TARGETS ARE LOCATED. Diaz: OUR FIRST AND FOREMOST PRIORITY IS TO SECURE THE NUCLEAR MATERIAL. ONCE OUR TEAMS HAVE DISABLED THE TARGETS, THE HAZARDOUS MATERIALS RESPONSE UNIT WILL SUPERVISE CONTAINMENT AND DISPOSAL OF THE FUEL RODS. OUR TARGETS ARE PRESUMED TO BE ARMED AND DANGEROUS. YOU'RE AUTHORIZED TO USE ALL NECESSARY FORCE. BUT TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT OUR U/C. NEXT TO SECURING THE NUCLEAR MATERIAL, HIS SAFETY IS TOP PRIORITY. AGENT AL-SAYEED IS WALKING OUT OF THIS RAID WITHOUT A SCRATCH. IS THAT UNDERSTOOD? EXCUSE ME, SIR, BUT WHAT'LL PREVENT THE TARGETS FROM DETONATING THE DIRTY BOMBS ONCE WE'RE INSIDE THE PERIMETER? OUR U/C HAS NEUTRALIZED THE EXPLOSIVE MATERIAL. THE R.D.X. IS INERT. WHAT ABOUT THE FEMALE TARGET? SHE'S OFFSITE AND OUR S.O.s HAVE A LOCK ON THAT SUBJECT AND WILL APPREHEND HER THE MINUTE THE RAID GOES DOWN. Gayle: WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS? FOR MY HUSBAND. YOU SAID HE...HE DIED. HE DIED IN IRAQ. WE WERE DRIVING ON A SMUGGLING ROUTE BETWEEN DAMASCUS AND BAGHDAD. GOING TO JOIN THE MUJAHIDIN IN FALLUJAH. WE WOULD FIGHT AGAINST THE ENEMIES OF GOD WHO HAD INVADED THE MUSLIM WORLD. INSHALLAH, WE WOULD DIE AS MARTYRS... TOGETHER. WE WERE IN SEPARATE VEHICLES. HISHAM, MY HUSBAND, WAS IN FRONT DRIVING THE MAIN TRUCK THAT CARRIED MORE MUJAHIDIN. I WAS FOLLOWING IN A JEEP WITH SOME LOCAL WOMEN. WE'D JUST CROSSED THE BORDER INTO IRAQ WHEN AN AMERICAN HELICOPTER GUNSHIP APPEARED FROM OVER THE SINJAR MOUNTAINS. WE TRIED TO TURN BACK. [SIGHING] THEY FIRED ON US. I SAW HISHAM'S TRUCK EXPLODE. MY JEEP TURNED OVER AND I WAS THROWN FROM THE WRECK. I WAS BLEEDING. NOT FROM A BULLET... FROM INSIDE. FROM BETWEEN MY LEGS. WHEN I FINALLY MADE IT TO THE HOSPITAL, THE DOCTOR TOLD ME I HAD LOST THE CHILD. I'M SORRY THAT HAPPENED TO YOU, MINA. I'M SURE YOU ARE, GAYLE. JUST KEEP DRIVING. Benito: SO THIS IS IT, MAN, THE REAL THING. MARTYRDOM VIDEOS. I'VE NEVER BEEN ON CAMERA BEFORE, I'M A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS. BEFORE WE DIE... TOGETHER... WILL YOU TELL ME YOUR REAL NAME? KARRAR BASHIR AL-ABBADI. THE KHALIFA'S COMMUNICATIONS CHIEF. MAHDI'S SUDAN IN THE 1890s. [SIGHING] MY NAME DOESN'T MATTER, DARWYN AL-HAKIM. ALL THAT MATTERS... IS THAT WE FULFILL OUR DESTINY. READY? Agent #1: THIS IS FIELD TEAM 1, WE'RE CLOSING IN ON THE EAST WALL. Agent #2: COPY THAT TEAM ONE. Agent #3: THIS IS ALPHA TEAM, WE'RE ON THE MOVE. Radio: AIR SIX, HOLDING. [BEEPING] Agent #3: MOTION SENSOR! FALL BACK! SHIT! ALPHA TEAM, COME IN. WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT? ARE THEY THERE? DO YOU READ, ALPHA TEAM? WHAT'S GOING ON? OH MY GOD. WE HAVE VISITORS. BENNY GET OUT WITH THE MISSILE AND PROCEED WITH THE PLAN AND IF YOU CAN'T MAKE IT, USE THE MISSILE! DON'T LET THEM TAKE YOUR LIFE! SALIM! YOU GO BACK TO THE CONTAINER ROOM AND YOU WATCH OVER THE BOMB. AND IF THE ENEMY REACH YOU, YOU WILL TAKE US ALL TO PARADISE. ALLAHU AKBAR. GO! GO! GO! YOU COME WITH ME. COME ON! FUCK! *** I'M FBI, KARRAR, IT'S OVER. PUT YOUR HANDS ON YOUR HEAD! I SAID PUT 'EM UP! [* RAP SONG] P.A.: THIS IS THE FBI, YOU'RE SURROUNDED. PUT DOWN YOUR WEAPONS AND COME OUT WITH YOUR HANDS ON YOUR HEAD. P.A.: THIS IS THE FBI. YOU ARE SURROUNDED. PUT DOWN YOUR WEAPONS. [* RAP SONG CONTINUES] P.A.: THIS IS THE FBI. YOU ARE SURROUNDED. P.A.: THIS IS THE FBI, PUT DOWN YOUR WEAPON! [CLICKING] WHAT THE FUCK, MAN! [PANTING] WHAT THE FUCK! AARGH! [GROANS] P.A.: SUSPECT'S BREAKING AWAY. CHECKING SOUTH PERIMETER. YOU MOTHER...FUCKER. Man: CLEAR! [PANTING] [WHISPERS IN ARABIC] [BEEP] [PANTING] [BEEPING] FUCK! ARRGH! [GROANING] ALL RIGHT... I SABOTAGED YOUR MISSILE AND YOUR R.D.X. SO YOU'RE SHIT OUT OF LUCK, ALL RIGHT? [PANTING] DID YOU KNOW PATRICE SERXNER? SHE WAS FBI TOO, WASN'T SHE? HUH? SHE WAS TOUGH, NOT AFRAID TO DIE, HUH? Patrice: FUCK YOU! SHUT UP. [COUGHS, PANTS] ARE YOU UPSET THAT WE CUT OFF THE PRETTY HEAD OF YOUR CRUSADER WHORE? Patrice: FUCK YOU! COME ON, GO AHEAD, KILL ME! COME ON, THAT'S WHAT YOU WANNA DO NOW! [MUFFLED SCREAM] YOU'RE RIGHT. BUT ALLAH SAYS IN THE HOLY QUR'AN... THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ME AND YOU. WHAT KIND OF TRUE MUSLIM WORK FOR THE AMERICANS? I DON'T WORK FOR THE AMERICANS. I AM AMERICAN. UHH. Agent: FREEZE! PUT YOUR HANDS ABOVE YOUR HEAD. SECURE THE WEAPON! FBI! FBI. [PANTING] Agent #2: GET READY TO BLOW THE CONTAINMENT ROOM DOOR. Radio: [INDISCERNIBLE INSTRUCTIONS] FIRE IN THE HOLE. [CLICK] LET'S GO! MOVE! MOVE! MOVE! ALL CLEAR! SECURE! WHERE'S SALIM? WELL, HE'S GOTTA BE SOMEWHERE IN THE BUILDING. FUCK! WHAT? WHAT IS IT? THE COOLER, IT...IT'S GOT THE OTHER FOUR FUEL RODS! OH SHIT! WE'RE GOING TO VEGAS? JUST KEEP YOUR EYES ON THE ROAD. WHY ME? I DON'T QUESTION MY ORDERS. PLEASE, I JUST WANNA LIVE FOR MY SON. YOU AFRAID, GAYLE? [SIGHS] GOOD. FEAR IS ALL AMERICANS UNDERSTAND. ESPECIALLY FEAR OF DEATH. YOU THINK YOU CAN FORCE ALL OF MANKIND TO DO WHAT YOU WANT BY MAKING THEM AFRAID TOO. AFRAID OF... YOUR MILITARY MIGHT, AFRAID OF YOUR LASER GUIDED BOMBS, AFRAID OF YOUR WHITE PHOSPHORUS. BUT YOU NEVER UNDERSTAND WHY MUSLIMS REFUSE TO SURRENDER. IT'S BECAUSE WE DON'T FEAR DEATH. THAT'S WHY YOU'LL NEVER TRULY CONQUER US. *** THAT WAS L.A.X. THEY ARRESTED THE BAGGAGE HANDLER WHO WAS GONNA SMUGGLE THE SUITCASE PACKED WITH THE FUEL RODS ONTO THE PLANE. LORENZO RIVERA, FORMER GANG MEMBER, ACTIVE CRIMINAL TIES. APPARENTLY HE THOUGHT HE WAS GONNA BE SMUGGLING COCAINE. JESUS CHRIST! WHO CAN'T GET PAST THE T.S.A. FORGIVE ME, MADAM COMMISSIONER BUT THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO BE POINTING FINGERS. THE L.A.X. SITUATION IS UNDER CONTROL NOW AND WE'RE AGGRESSIVELY INTERROGATING ABUD HAMID MUSA, A.K.A. KARRAR, REGARDING THE WHEREABOUTS OF MINA VAN DER HULST AND SALIM AL-DULAIMI. WHAT HAVE YOU GOT OUT OF HIM? NOTHING YET BUT AS FAR AS WE KNOW, VAN DER HULST IS UNARMED AND THE EXPLOSIVES SALIM NEEDS TO DETONATE HIS DIRTY BOMB HAVE BEEN NEUTRALIZED BY OUR U/C. BUT YOU STILL GOT A BAD GUY AT LARGE IN L.A. WITH A COOLER FULL OF SPENT NUCLEAR FUEL RODS. WELL, WE PUT OUT A NATIONWIDE BOLO ON AL-DULAIMI AND VAN DER HULST. THE SECOND ANY OFFICER SEES ANYTHING, OUR PHONE'S THE FIRST TO RING. BUT I TELL YOU, IT'LL BE A HELL OF A LOT EASIER TO LOCATE THESE GUYS IF EVERYTHING APPEARS NORMAL AND THE CITY IS NOT ON LOCK-DOWN. WELL, WHETHER YOU GO PUBLIC OR NOT I'M ACTIVATING A W.M.D. NUCLEAR THREAT PROTOCOL FOR THE GREATER LOS ANGELES AREA. IT WON'T INVOLVE MAKING AN ANNOUNCEMENT OF ANY KIND. WE JUST QUIETLY DEPLOY RADIOLOGICAL SNIFFERS AT THE CITY'S MOST LIKELY TARGETS. YOU SHOULD DO A GRID SEARCH TOO, JIM. START CRISSCROSSING THE CITY WITH THE AIRBORNE UNIT. SO LET'S DO IT NOW. Radio: [INDISCERNIBLE] [SIGHS] IS THIS WHAT FATIMA WOULD HAVE DONE? [SCOFFS] WHAT? A BOOK YOU SHOWED ME. I READ HOW MUHAMMAD'S DAUGHTER, FATIMA USED TO GO HUNGRY HERSELF IN ORDER TO FEED PRISONERS OF WAR. SHUT UP. OR MUHAMMAD'S WIFE, AISHA? SHE ALWAYS TOLD THE TRUTH EVEN WHEN THE WHOLE WORLD WAS AGAINST HER. STOP. YOU KNOW, YOU CALL YOURSELF A MUSLIM, YOU'RE NOTHING LIKE THOSE WOMEN IN THE BOOKS. THEY WERE HEROES. YOU'RE JUST A PSYCHOTIC BITCH WITH A DEATH WISH. I SAID SHUT UP. [TIRES SCREECH] UHH! [GUNSHOT] *** UHH. [COUGHS] [GASPS] [SPLUTTERING] Man: 911 EMERGENCY. [BREATHLESS] HELP ME. I'VE BEEN SHOT. Man: CAN YOU TELL ME WHERE YOU ARE? [PANTING] THERE'S... THERE'S A WOMAN. THERE'S A WOMAN, SHE'S A TERRORIST. SHE'S HEADED TO VEGAS. CALIFORNIA LICENSE PLATE 5-I-S-G...

ESE, YOU GOT ANY M-80S? FOLLOW ME. *** [SPEAKS ARABIC] [SPEAKS ARABIC] *** ILIJA! ASSALAM ALAIKUM, MY BROTHER. ALAIKUM ASSALAM. FARIK, I CAN'T BELIEVE MY EYES. THIS IS A MIRACLE. IT'S TRUE! WE WERE TO MEET IN PARADISE. THIS WORLD WILL HAVE TO DO FOR NOW. SO HOW WAS SARAJEVO? NOT THAT MUCH HAVE CHANGED SINCE THE SIEGE. IT HAS. YOU KNOW, OF COURSE YOU COULDN'T STAY THERE. A WARRIOR'S PLACE IS ON THE FRONT LINE. YES, YOU'RE RIGHT. I JUST WANTED TO SEE MY COUNTRY AGAIN... ONE LAST TIME. LOOK AT YOU. YOU LOOK LIKE A SURFER FROM VENICE BEACH. I LEAVE YOU FOR A MOMENT AND YOU GO AND CHANGE EVERYTHING. NOTHING HAS CHANGED ON THE INSIDE. I ADMIT...WHEN THEY TOLD ME YOU DISAPPEARED I...I WAS WORRIED. MY CONFIDENCE WAS SHAKEN. YOU WEREN'T JUST ANOTHER SOLDIER TO ME, ILIJA. EVEN THOUGH I KNEW YOU WERE ALIVE, I MOURNED YOUR LOSS. FARIK, THERE WAS NEVER A NEED TO DOUBT OUR FRIENDSHIP OR MY LOYALTY. NO. WHEN I LOOK AT YOUR FACE I KNOW I LOOK AT THE FACE OF MY BROTHER. I FORGIVE YOU AND I WELCOME YOU BACK. *** COME. MY BROTHERS. I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE TO YOU A LOYAL AND DEDICATED HOLY WARRIOR. A TRUE BELIEVER AND MY RIGHT HAND IN ALL MY MOST DIFFICULT BATTLES. THIS IS ILIJA KORJENIC AND I PROCLAIM HIM MY KHALIFA. MY LIEUTENANT, MY STEWARD AND MY SUCCESSOR ON THIS EARTH UNTIL WE MEET AGAIN IN PARADISE. [CHEERS] L.A.P.D. GOT A REPORT OF A CAR JACKING EARLIER TODAY. SUSPECT FITS SALIM'S DESCRIPTION. ANY SIGN OF THE CAR? FOUND ABANDONED IN EAST L.A. ABOUT AN HOUR AGO. AND IT GETS WORSE. NEAR THE HOME WHERE THEY FOUND THE CAR L.A.P.D. DISCOVERED THE BODY OF A MAN KNOWN TO BE A FIREWORKS DEALER IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD AND HIS VAN IS MISSING... ALONG WITH HIS FIREWORKS. SALIM IS RIGGING HIS OWN BOMB. THAT'S IT. I SAY WE SHUT DOWN THE WHOLE CITY. SALIM AL-DULAIMI'S GOT THE FUCKING EXPLOSIVES TO SET OFF A DIRTY BOMB IN THE MIDDLE OF LOS ANGELES! THAT'S NOT GONNA SOLVE OUR PROBLEM! THE SECOND SALIM HEARS ABOUT A SHUTDOWN HE'S GONNA WALK INTO THE NEAREST PUBLIC PLACE AND BLOW HIMSELF UP ALONG WITH THE NUCLEAR MATERIAL. SHOULDN'T WE AT LEAST SHUT DOWN THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL? SALIM DOESN'T KNOW THAT WE'RE AWARE THAT THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL IS A TARGET. I'LL BET THAT'S STILL WHERE HE'S HEADED TONIGHT. SO YOU WANNA SET A TRAP FOR HIM? USING 17,000 PEOPLE AS LIVE BAIT? WE'LL MAKE SURE HE NEVER GETS INTO THE BOWL. WE'LL TAKE HIM OUT BEFORE HE HITS THE TURNSTILE. I MEAN WE'LL STILL HAVE OUR U/C. HIS COVER'S INTACT WITH THE TARGETS AND HE CAN HELP US PUT DOWN SALIM. IT'S OUR BEST OPTION. IT'S WORTH THE RISK. JESUS! THERE'S A CAPACITY CROWD TONIGHT. IT'S THE 4TH OF JULY, FOR CHRIST'S SAKES! THE MAYOR, IS NOT GONNA WANNA HAVE BULLETS FLYING AROUND. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, THE MAYOR'S OFFICE WON'T APPROVE ANY OF THIS. THEY'RE GONNA BLOW THE WHISTLE ON THIS WHOLE OPERATION IN ORDER TO COVER THEIR ASSES. THIS IS BULLSHIT. I HAVE TO TELL THE MAYOR. OF COURSE, MA'AM. JUST TAKE YOUR OWN SWEET TIME DOING IT. *** [WHISPERS] FUCK. [BREATHES HEAVILY] YOU LOOK LIKE SHIT. YEAH, I KNOW. I'VE BEEN UM... I'VE BEEN UP ALL NIGHT TRYING TO THINK OF SOMETHING TO SAY THAT WOULD KEEP YOU FROM SLAMMING THE DOOR ON ME. *** GO ON. I'M SCARED, JASON. AND I FEEL LIKE I'VE GOTTEN WRAPPED UP IN SOMETHING THAT'S COMPLETELY OUT OF MY CONTROL. AND I KNOW IT'S WHAT I WANT BUT... NOW THAT I'M SO CLOSE ALL OF A SUDDEN I'M FUCKING TERRIFIED. IS THAT SUPPOSED TO BE AN APOLOGY? NO, I'M JUST TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO YOU WHAT I'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH. OKAY? I'VE BEEN HIDING WHO I AM FOR SO LONG. YOU KNOW, I LIED TO EVERYONE... AND IT'S FINALLY TIME TO DO WHAT'S RIGHT. THEN ALL THESE THOUGHTS COME RUSHING OVER ME, MY FAMILY, MY FRIENDS BACK HOME. I'VE GOT TICKETS TO THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL TONIGHT. YOU KNOW, I EVEN GOT A COOLER FOR A PICNIC. IT WOULD BE GREAT IF YOU CAME WITH ME. * SWEET... HELLO, MA'AM, WELCOME TO LAS VEGAS. HI. HAVE A HAPPY 4TH OF JULY. THANK YOU. NEED HELP WITH YOUR BAG?

MORE LIKELY THAN NOT, MORE THAN ONE. SO WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO? [CROWD, BAND PLAYS] THIS IS AGENT AL-SAYEED, I'M IN POSITION OUTSIDE THE SOUTH GATE. HERE, I'LL GET THAT. OH NO, UH...NO. I'VE GOT IT, REALLY. RADIOLOGICAL SNIFFERS JUST GOT A HIT IN THE PARKING LOT. OKAY, HE'S HERE. ECHO TEAM'S GOT A VISUAL OF THE SUBJECT. IS THAT SALIM? Agent Russell: YEAH. HE SHAVED HIS BEARD OFF. WHO'S THAT WITH HIM? DARWYN, THE TARGET'S HEADED UP THE SOUTH EAST ENTRANCE THROUGH THE PICNIC AREA BUT HE'S GOT AN UNIDENTIFIED WHITE MALE IN HIS TWENTIES WITH HIM. Jason: ARE YOU NERVOUS? Salim: YEAH, A LITTLE. Jason: WHAT FOR? YOU'RE DOING GREAT. WE'RE DOING GREAT. SEE, LOOK AROUND. WE'RE HAPPY TOGETHER, NOBODY GIVES A FUCK. YEAH. I GUESS IT'S ALL RIGHT. COME HERE. THANKS. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS TO ME. Darwyn: I SEE SALIM. WHAT ABOUT THE UNIDENTIFIED MALE? Darwyn: HE'S NOT A TARGET. I REPEAT, THE UNIDENTIFIED MALE IS NOT A TARGET. Russell: THEN WHO IS HE? [SIGHS] JUST TRUST ME, I'M POSITIVE. HE DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON HERE. LET'S TRY HARD NOT TO TAKE HIM OUT. THIS IS GONNA BE GREAT, TRUST ME. THIS IS DELTA TEAM, I'VE GOT A SHOT. EVERYONE HOLD YOUR FIRE. WHAT? HOLD YOUR FIRE. HE'S RIGGED A DEAD MAN'S SWITCH TO GO OFF THE SECOND HE RELEASES HIS GRIP ON THAT COOLER. IF YOU SHOOT HIM, WE'RE ALL FUCKED. JESUS CHRIST!

WHAT HAPPENED TO KARRAR AND BENNY? THEY DIDN'T MAKE IT. LET ME GRAB THAT FOR YOU. IT'S ALL RIGHT. NO! LET GO OF IT! TAKE HIM OUT NOW! WHAT ARE YOU DOING? Darwyn: TAKE HIM OUT! [GUNSHOTS, SCREAMING] Agent: WE HAVE IT SECURED. WHAT'S GOING ON? WHAT'S HAPPENING? OKAY, CLEAR THE AREA NOW. GET THE BOMB SQUAD HERE. NOW. NOW. Agent: ALL RIGHT, LET'S CLEAR THIS AREA. [BAND PLAYS STARS AND STRIPES FOREVER ] *** Diaz: THE STORY THE MEDIA IS GETTING IS THAT SALIM WAS OFFICIALLY SHOT BY AN H.R.T. SNIPER. HE WAS CARRYING CONVENTIONAL EXPLOSIVES, WEAK ONES, IMPROVISED FROM ILLEGAL FIREWORKS. NOTHING ABOUT THE FUEL RODS. NO REASON TO SET OFF ANY MORE OF A PANIC THAN WE'VE ALREADY GOT. YOU KNOW, THE TRUTH ABOUT THAT IS GONNA GET LEAKED EVENTUALLY. SOME BIG SHOT IN WASHINGTON IS GONNA WANNA BRAG ABOUT IT. [PHONE RINGING] EXCUSE ME. [LAUGHTER, INAUDIBLE CHATTER] SMEARED IT ALL OVER. YOU SAW HIM. [LAUGHTER, CHATTER] CONGRATULATIONS. GOOD JOB. IT WAS A LOT OF WORK. Russell: THANKS, BUDDY. THANKS VERY MUCH. [DIALING] [RINGS] Gayle: DARWYN, WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU?
