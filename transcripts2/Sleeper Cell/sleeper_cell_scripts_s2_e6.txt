 Narrator: PREVIOUSLY ON SLEEPER CELL. NOW ANY TIME YOU'D LIKE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT ISLAM I'M ALWAYS HERE. SOMETHING ABOUT BEING STALKED BY A PSYCHOTIC YOU-KNOW-WHATORIST STRESSES ME OUT. YOUR BOYFRIEND THINKS HE CAN DO WHATEVER HE WANTS. BUT HE CAN'T. YOU WANT ME TO GO BEHIND HIS BACK? NO FUCKING WAY! DON'T YOU EVER THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE DOING, HOW YOU MAKE IT UP TO GOD? I HAD NO IDEA YOU WERE A BIBLE THUMPER.

 I'M NOT A BIBLE THUMPER! I NEED NEW PAPERS AND A WAY OUT OF CANADA. SARAJEVO. DIFFERENT WORLD, BROTHER. BEFORE, I KILL YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE A MUSLIM, YOU'LL KILL ME FOR BEING SERB. NOT ANY MORE. MY LAWYER SAYS WE CAN PROBABLY WIN IF WE PETITION THE COURT FOR CUSTODY OF MARCUS. WHAT IF I...SPIED ON HIM? WATCHED DARWYN FOR YOU. WOULD YOU MAKE HER STOP THEN? WELCOME MY BROTHER. YOU ARE TRULY BACK FROM THE DEAD. WE MUST STRIKE FIRST. WE MUST BE HEARD. ORDERS ARE TO PICK UP THE SHIPMENT WEDNESDAY NIGHT. PORT OF L.A.

 THINK IT'S A NUCLEAR PAYLOAD? THAT'S WHERE MY MONEY IS. MY NAME IS KARRAR BASHIR AL ABBADI. I AM THE SHIPMENT YOU'VE BEEN WAITING FOR. SON OF A BITCH! WHERE'S THE NUCLEAR SHIT? SITUATION'S CHANGED. BECAUSE OF THAT, I'M PREPARED TO TAKE YOU UP ON YOUR OFFER. DO WE HAVE A DEAL? YEAH. YEAH, WE HAVE A DEAL. *** [* DRUMMING] Man: PRIVATE FIRST CLASS. MARIO ORTIZ. *** I'M IMPRESSED. EVERYTHING SEEMS TO HAVE GONE SMOOTHLY IN PREPARATION FOR OUR DAY OF MARTYRDOM. OF COURSE, THIS SHOULD BE CREDITED TO YOUR LEADER, BROTHER DARWYN AL-HAKIM. YET THINGS MUST CHANGE, AS THEY ALWAYS DO IN LIFE. YOU WILL NO LONGER BE TAKING ORDERS FROM BROTHER AL-HAKIM. BECAUSE FROM NOW ON, YOU WILL BE TAKING THEM FROM ME. ALLAHU AKBAR. BY THE WAY, BROTHER FARIK SAYS HELLO. [CHILDREN SQUEALING] MY COURIER HAS BROUGHT YOUR E-MAILS FROM RIYADH. [SPEAKING ARABIC] [SPEAKS ARABIC] WHAT'S WRONG? THAT FAITHLESS DOG, AZIZ! HE'S DEMANDING 10 MILLION DOLLARS TO COMPLETE THE NUCLEAR TRANSFER. I SHOULD HAVE KILLED HIM AND HIS WHOLE FAMILY. WHAT IS THE PROBLEM? HE WANTS THE CASH WIRED IN THE NEXT 48 HOURS. WELL, THAT IS DEFINITELY A CONCERN. WHAT AZIZ IS ASKING IS IMPOSSIBLE. WITH ALLAH, ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE. MY COUSIN ACROSS THE BORDER IN YEMEN HAS BEEN COMPLAINING ABOUT A PROBLEM IN HIS HOME TOWN. SO? SO HIS PROBLEM MAY BE OUR SOLUTION. SALIM AND OUR NEW BOSS HAVE BEEN IN THERE FOREVER, MAN. ANY IDEA WHAT'S UP? HE'S PROBABLY GETTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE ATTACK. OR HE FUCKED UP AND KARRAR IS SLOWLY TORTURING HIM. WHAT THE HELL IS UP WITH THE RECEPTION? SORRY. IT'S THE BEST WE COULD DO. THE RADIATION SHIELDING'S INTERFERING WITH THE MICROWAVE. IT MAKES IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO TRANSMIT OUT. AND THE WALLS ARE TOO DAMN THICK TO DRILL THROUGH AND INSTALL A HARD LINE. [DOOR OPENS] SISTER MINA, PLEASE JOIN ME. [MAN SPEAKS BOSNIAN] [* ARABIC SONG] [CHATTER AND SHOUTING] SO HOW ARE YOU ENJOYING MY COUSIN'S HOSPITALITY? HIS HOSPITALITY KNOWS NO BOUNDS. AND HIS HOME IS AN OASIS IN EVERY WAY. [SCHOOL BELL] NOT EXACTLY YOUR TYPICAL SCHOOL IN THE MOUNTAINS OF YEMEN. IT IS AN ABOMINATION. YOU DON'T SEE VALUE IN OFFERING YOUR CHILDREN EXPOSURE TO MODERN TECHNOLOGY, WESTERN SCIENCE, PHILOSOPHY? WHAT HAS BEEN TAUGHT IN OUR MADRASAS FOR CENTURIES HAS BEEN MORE THAN ENOUGH FOR THE BELIEVERS. I AM SO HAPPY YOU ARE HERE, THAT THE BROTHERHOOD HAS FINALLY TAKEN THIS THREAT SERIOUSLY. I TRUST YOU WILL CLEANSE THIS STAIN OFF OUR LAND. YASSER, MY FRIEND! SUHEIL! AS-SALAAMU ALAIKUM. WA-ALAYKUM AS-SALAAM. AS I PROMISED, NAIF AL-FALASI. AS-SALAAMU ALAIKUM. WA-ALAYKUM AS-SALAAM. IT'S TRULY AN HONOR. YOUR FAMILY IS WELL RESPECTED IN THE PENINSULA. NO, THE HONOR IS MINE. I MUST SAY I'M VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE REMARKABLE WORK YOU'RE DOING FOR THE CHILDREN OF YEMEN. IT IS ALL VERY EXCITING. LOOK AT OUR MOST RECENT ADDITIONS TO OUR CURRICULUM, INTERACTIVE CD-ROMS, DEALING WITH THE GREAT PHILOSOPHERS, ARISTOTLE, SOCRATES... THIS ONE IS ON PLATO. HUH? WHERE'S THE ONE ON OSAMA? I'M JUST JOKING, OF COURSE. SADLY, THAT'S ALL THE WEST KNOWS OF OUR INTELLECTUAL HERITAGE. GREAT MUSLIM PHILOSOPHERS SUCH AS IBN RUSHD AND IBN SINA ARE VIRTUALLY UNKNOWN IN AMERICA AND EUROPE. BUT NOT HERE. WE EXAMINE THE TEACHINGS OF ALL THE GREAT MUSLIM SCHOLARS. THE MYSTICISM OF AL-GHAZALI, THE HISTORICAL METHODOLOGY OF IBN KHALDUN. OUR WESTERN CURRICULUM DOES NOT SUPPLANT THE TRADITIONAL STUDIES. IT COMPLEMENTS THEM. WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE COME TO MEET WITH YOUR BUSINESS PARTNER. OF COURSE. YES, OF COURSE. TYLER IS ANXIOUS TO MEET WITH YOU AS WELL. EXCUSE THE MESS. BEEN DOING SOME LAST-MINUTE CONSTRUCTION ON THE FACILITY? MM, MM. IT'S JUST THE PLUMBING BUT... WE CAN DO WITHOUT IT FOR THE TIME BEING. [SPEAKS ARABIC] *** BROTHER BENITO. I NEVER THANKED YOU FOR WHAT YOU DID FOR ME. WITH MR. ROSSMAN. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. WELL, THANK YOU ANYWAY. YOU'RE MY BROTHER. AND I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU AS MY BROTHER. [SPEAKS ARABIC] EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT, BROTHER DARWYN? YEAH. SURE. GOOD. PLEASE, COME WITH ME. [CHATTER] PLEASE. RIGHT THIS WAY. MR. GRANGE, GOOD AFTERNOON. OH, CALL ME TYLER. MY PLEASURE, TYLER. PLEASE. MAY I? OH, YES. ABSOLUTELY. SO, UH...HOW CAN I HELP YOU? WELL, IT'S MORE LIKE HOW I CAN HELP YOU. OK, WELL, I'M ALL EARS. 114 EMPTY LOTS IN YANBU, SAUDI ARABIA WHERE YOU CAN EXPAND YOUR EDUCATIONAL ENDEAVORS INTO THE KINGDOM. WELL, NOW, THOSE LOTS IN YANBU, AREN'T THEY PRIME REAL ESTATE FOR COMMERCIAL VENTURES? WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO DEVELOP THEM INTO NON-PROFIT SCHOOLS? MY FAMILY'S BECOME VERY SUCCESSFUL DUE TO THE OPPORTUNITIES PROVIDED BY OUR PATRONS IN THE SAUDI ROYAL FAMILY. WE FEEL IT IS OUR DUTY TO GIVE BACK TO SOCIETY. I SHARE YOUR PHILOSOPHY. I DON'T BELIEVE IN HANDOUTS, BUT I DO BELIEVE IN SPENDING MY MONEY BUILDING SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES. EDUCATION IS THE WAY TO END POVERTY. TYLER IS A MUSLIM AT HEART. THE PROPHET MOHAMMED, PEACE BE UPON HIM, HAS MADE IT VERY CLEAR IN ONE OF HIS HADITHS. "SEEK KNOWLEDGE, EVEN IF YOU MUST GO TO CHINA." WHAT A COINCIDENCE. MADE IN CHINA. [LAUGHS] WITH YOUR PERMISSION, I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO MY FATHER AND BEGIN DISCUSSIONS ON USING THOSE LOTS AS POTENTIAL SITES FOR MORE OF YOUR SCHOOLS. OF COURSE. THE MORE SCHOOLS I CAN BUILD THE BETTER. BUT ASSURE YOUR FATHER THAT I NEED HIS CONTACTS, NOT HIS CASH. I HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO FINANCE 1,000 SCHOOLS IN ARABIA. I WOULDN'T SAY THAT TOO LOUDLY, TYLER. YEMEN IS FAMOUS FOR TWO THINGS. ITS COFFEE AND ITS BANDITS. [TYLER LAUGHS] *** HOW DID SHE MANAGE THIS? I CAN'T DISCLOSE THAT. I SIGN AWAY ANY FUTURE CLAIM OF CUSTODY, YOU TAKE FIVE YEARS OFF MY SON'S SENTENCE. THAT'S NOT SOMETHING A MANICURIST CAN JUST DO. YOU'RE ASKING ME TO CHOOSE BETWEEN MY SON'S FUTURE... AND MY GRANDSON'S. YOU DO ME A FAVOR. YOU TELL THAT BITCH DAUGHTER-IN-LAW OF MINE I HOPE SHE CHOKES ON ALL THAT BLACK COCK SHE'S BEEN SUCKING. [CHILDREN'S CHATTER] Teacher: YOUR MOM'S HERE! [INDISTINCT DIALOGUE] HEY, MINA. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? THOUGHT I'D COME BY, SAY HELLO. MAYBE SET A PLAYDATE WITH THE KIDS I TAKE CARE OF. OH, YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT'S REALLY NICE BUT HE'S A LITTLE YOUNG, SO... I'M SIX AND THREE QUARTERS! OH, RIGHT! WE REALLY SHOULD BE GOING. GAYLE... I KNOW I CAN BE VERY DIRECT SOMETIMES BUT... PLEASE DON'T BE MAD AT ME. I'M NOT MAD AT YOU. NO, ARE YOU SURE? YOU'D TELL ME IF YOU WERE, RIGHT? WE DON'T KNOW EACH OTHER REALLY WELL AND I'D LIKE YOU TO BE HONEST WITH ME. OF COURSE. ALWAYS BE HONEST. ISN'T THAT RIGHT, MARCUS? HONESTY IS THE BEST POLICY. WE HATE LIARS. [LAUGHS] SO, UM, WHAT DO YOU WANT, MINA? NOW, DON'T SAY NO UNTIL I'M FINISHED. BUT THERE ARE OTHER WOMEN JUST LIKE YOU. AND THEY COME TOGETHER IN A GROUP TO DISCUSS THINGS. EXPLORING THE QU'RAN FOR ANSWERS TO THEIR PROBLEMS. WELL, MY BOYFRIEND ISN'T ASKING ME TO CONVERT TO ISLAM. WELL, NEITHER AM I. I'M JUST ASKING YOU TO LISTEN, AND BRING AN OPEN MIND. WELL, I DON'T KNOW, MINA. LET ME SEE IF MAYBE I CAN GET A SITTER FOR MARCUS. OK. BYE! BYE, MARCUS. BYE. COME ON, BABY. LET'S HURRY UP. PULL OVER HERE, DARWYN. *** NICE VIEW. HOW DOES IT CONNECT TO OUR ATTACK OPERATION? [CAMERA SHUTTER WHIRS] [CAMERA SHUTTER WHIRS] LISTEN. YOU NEED TO START LEVELING WITH ME ABOUT THE PLAN. I HAVE BEEN RUNNING THIS CELL FOR WEEKS. AND WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED EVERYTHING THAT THE BASES ASKED FOR, MAN, EVERYTHING. YOU MARCH IN HERE, TALK TO MY PEOPLE BEHIND MY BACK, YOU KEEP ME OUT OF THE LOOP. HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO HELP YOU WHEN YOU DON'T TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON? YOU CANNOT DO THIS ALONE. I WAS ONE OF BROTHER FARIK'S LOYAL SOLDIERS. HE TRUSTED ME. YOU ARE RIGHT, DARWYN. YOU HAVE PROVED YOUR LOYALTY TO THE CAUSE. I CAN'T TELL YOU EVERYTHING. BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT WE ARE GETTING THE RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL WE NEED FROM SAN ONOFRE POWER PLANT. WE HAVE A CONTACT THERE. WE WILL BE SMUGGLING OUT IN THE NEXT 48 HOURS. AND THEN...WE SHALL BEGIN THE FINAL PHASE OF OUR OPERATION. NOW, NO MORE QUESTION. WE HAVE AN ERRAND TO RUN. [AIRPLANE OVERHEAD] Woman on PA: MAY I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION, PLEASE? THIS IS A GATE CHANGE ANNOUNCEMENT. FLIGHT 233 ARRIVING FROM... LITTLE RENZO. HOW'S IT HANGING, BRO? BENNY V. WHAT'S UP, MAN? I AIN'T SEEN YOU IN A WHILE. YOU STILL BOOSTING CARS IN BOYLE HEIGHTS? SHIT. THAT'S OLD NEWS. I MOVED UP A LITTLE, MAN. I'M MAKING SOME SERIOUS COIN THESE DAYS. MOVING SERIOUS SHIT IN AND OUT OF THE COUNTRY. PROBLEM IS, THERE WAS A LITTLE GLITCH IN THE SYSTEM. I GOT THIS SPECIAL SUITCASE NEEDS TO MAKE ITS DESTINATION ON TIME, OR A WHOLE LOT OF SERIOUS MOTHERFUCKERS DON'T GET PAID. NOW, I CAN PASS SOME OF THAT SERIOUS MONEY ONTO YOU, MY MAN. IF YOU CAN HELP ME PUT THAT SUITCASE ON THE FLIGHT IT NEEDS TO GO ON. I DON'T KNOW, BENNY. I MEAN... SECURITY'S EXTRA TIGHT THESE DAYS. LORENZO. I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO SMUGGLE A BOMB IN A BOTTLE OF GATORADE. [LAUGHS] IT'S JUST SOME DRUGS IN A SUITCASE, BRO. SERIOUS MONEY? JUST HOW SERIOUS? *** GO BACK TO THE HOSPITAL AND WAIT FOR ME. [* MAN RAPPING] ILIJA? [SPEAKS BOSNIAN] Man: READY! [GUNS COCKED] AIM...FIRE! READY! AIM...FIRE! [* THE LAST POST] READY...AIM...FIRE! [GUNSHOTS] MY DEEPEST CONDOLENCES, MRS. ORTIZ. AND THANKS FROM A GRATEFUL NATION. [SOBS] ANY MORE BACKGROUND ON KARRAR? Russ: NOTHING. FUCKER'S HIGHLY TRAINED. HE'S RUNNING PROFESSIONAL COUNTER-SURVEILLANCE PATTERNS ALL OVER US. IN OTHER WORDS, YOU LOST HIM. THAT'S FUCKING GREAT, RUSS. HEY, DARWYN. WHENEVER YOU WANT TO HELP US OUT, GIVE US A LITTLE MORE INTEL ON WHAT'S GOING ON, THAT WOULD BE GREAT. SHUT UP AND LISTEN. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I'M ABOUT TO DO. THE NUCLEAR MATERIAL'S COMING OUT OF SAN ONOFRE. THE POWER PLANT? THAT'S RIGHT. KARRAR'S GOT A MAN ON THE INSIDE WHO'S GONNA BE SMUGGLING SOMETHING OUT SOMETIME WITHIN THE NEXT 48 HOURS. I'M GUESSING FUEL RODS OR ENRICHED URANIUM OF SOME KIND. NEED TO SET UP ALL OVER THAT PLANT, MAN. LOCK IT UP TIGHT... AND WAIT FOR KARRAR TO MAKE HIS MOVE. Russ: RIGHT. I'M ON IT. THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE. MAKE SURE YOUR SURVEILLANCE OPERATIONS GUYS KEEP AN EYE ON MINA. THEY NEED TO WATCH HER LIKE A FUCKING HAWK. SHE SAID GOODBYE TO ME TODAY. SHE SAID IT LIKE IT WAS FOR GOOD. *** [CHATTER] WHO CAN TELL ME WHAT RIGHTS THE FIRST AMENDMENT TO THE U.S. CONSTITUTION GUARANTEES? YES, MARYAM? FREEDOM OF RELIGION, FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND THE PRESS AND FREEDOM TO ASSEMBLE PEACEABLY AND PETITION THE GOVERNMENT FOR REDRESS OF GRIEVANCES. [LAUGHS] EXCELLENT. YES, YOU HAVE A QUESTION? [SPEAKS ARABIC] NOW, THE HOLY QU'RAN SAYS THERE SHOULD BE NO COMPULSION IN RELIGION. THINK ABOUT THAT. MUSLIMS BELIEVED IN THE FREEDOM OF RELIGION 1100 YEARS BEFORE THE U.S. CONSTITUTION WAS EVEN WRITTEN. ONLY PEOPLE WHO HAVE WEAK FAITH ARE AFRAID TO LEARN ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE'S CULTURES AND RELIGIONS. AND WHEN YOU LEARN MORE ABOUT OTHERS, YOU DISCOVER THAT THEY ARE NOT AS DIFFERENT AS YOU FIRST BELIEVED. HUH? I WOULD LIKE... CHEDDAR CHEESE ON MY HAMBURGER. I WOULD LIKE... CHEDDAR CHEESE... ON MY HIJAB. [SPEAKS BOSNIAN] I WOULD LIKE... PRIVATE LESSONS WITH PROFESSOR VOISLAV! [LAUGHTER] [SPEAKS BOSNIAN] IN ENGLISH! [LAUGHTER] MLADIC EATS ASS. All: MLADIC EATS ASS! MLADIC EATS ASS! MLADIC EATS ASS! [* TECHNO] YOU SEE SOMETHING YOU LIKE? I HEARD YOU RENT SPECIAL-INTEREST VEHICLES HERE? SHOPPING FOR A RIDE, HUH? CAN YOU BE A LITTLE MORE SPECIFIC ABOUT THAT SPECIAL INTEREST THING? DO YOU WANT THE ZOMBIELANCE? OR THE SKULL-ROD? THAT'S NOT NECESSARY. I JUST, UM... I WANT TO RENT THE ONE YOU HAVE OUT BACK. EXCUSE ME FOR ASKING, BUT... ARE YOU PERSIAN? LOOK, I KNOW THAT COMING OUT OF THE CLOSET IS REALLY HARD FOR YOU IRANIAN GUYS. BUT YOU'RE AMONG FRIENDS HERE. HONEST. LOOK, YOU'VE GOT THE WRONG IDEA ABOUT ME. I JUST WANT TO RENT THE VEHICLE, IS THAT ALL RIGHT? SUIT YOURSELF. I JUST NEED A VALID DRIVER'S LICENSE AND A CREDIT CARD. *** Gayle: MINA CAME TO VISIT ME AGAIN. AT MARCUS'S CAMP. WHAT HAPPENED? NOTHING NEW. SHE STILL WANTS TO BE FRIENDS. LOOK, GAYLE, I'M SORRY. FOR PUTTING YOU AND MARCUS THROUGH ALL OF THIS. I NEVER WANTED THIS TO HAPPEN. THE TRUTH? I DON'T KNOW WHEN I'M GONNA BE ABLE TO TAKE THAT TEACHING JOB AT QUANTICO. THE MORE I THINK ABOUT IT, THE MORE I REALIZE THAT THAT ANSWER'S PROBABLY NEVER. YEAH. I KIND OF FIGURED. YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DO IT. I MEAN... KEEPING IT ALL TO YOURSELF. LIKE, I JUST HAD A TASTE OF WHAT YOU GO THROUGH EVERY DAY AND I CAN BARELY STAND IT. YOU MUST BE SO ALONE. WHO CAN YOU TALK TO WHO CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH? AND...YOU HAVE TO HANG AROUND ALMOST EVERY DAY WITH A BUNCH OF PSYCHOPATHS WHO ARE FUCKING UP YOUR RELIGION. I MEAN, I KNOW THAT THEY MUST SAY AND DO ALL SORTS OF SHIT THAT MAKES YOU ANGRY. AND YOU CAN'T TELL ANYONE, JUST HAVE TO KEEP IT ALL BOTTLED UP INSIDE. I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE. YEAH, YOU DO. YOU CAN TALK TO ME. I MEAN, NOT EVERY SINGLE THING YOU DO CAN BE TOP SECRET. I GUESS NOT. OK. SO TELL ME... HOW YOU SPENT YOUR DAY. ALL RIGHT, I, UM... I TOOK A DRIVE... UP TO AN OVERLOOK. ON THE WESTSIDE. GREAT VIEW OF THE CITY. HOW HARD WAS THAT? [SIGHS] IT'D BE NICE IF, UH... WE WAKE UP TOMORROW AND THE WHOLE WORLD WOULD JUST... CHANGE, YOU KNOW? YEAH. [DESPERATE PANTING] OH! [YELLS IN ECSTASY] [BOTH GASP AND SIGH] JESUS CHRIST. WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU, JULIA ROBERTS IN PRETTY WOMAN OR SOMETHING? NO, I'M SORRY, IT'S JUST, ER... FUCK, YOU KNOW THAT MAKES ME UNCOMFORTABLE. LET'S TALK ABOUT IT. DINNER TONIGHT. I KNOW THIS GREAT THAI RESTAURANT IN LARCHMONT. FOR CHRIST'S SAKES, MAN. EVERYTHING'S FINE... AS LONG AS WE'RE FUCKING. THAT'S IT, HUH? NOTHIN' ELSE. CAN'T BE SEEN WITH ME IN PUBLIC, AFRAID YOUR BUDDIES FROM THE MOSQUE WILL CATCH US AND REPORT YOU TO ALLAH? HEY! YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT, OK? ABOUT MY RELIGION, ABOUT ME. AND DON'T YOU EVER TAKE GOD'S NAME IN VAIN IN FRONT OF ME AGAIN, NOT IF YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOOD FOR YOU! HOW CAN I KNOW ANYTHING MORE ABOUT YOU? YOU WON'T LET ME! THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO CHANGE. IT'S NOT LIKE THAT, JASE. OK? IT CAN'T BE. NOT WITH ME. I'M SORRY. ME TOO. LISTEN, I'VE GOT TO GO. BECAUSE YOU'RE PISSED OFF AT ME. NO. NO, IT'S JUST, UM... I HAVE TO ATTEND A FUNERAL, THAT'S ALL. [* RAPPING IN BOSNIAN] [SPEAKS ARABIC] [PHONE RINGS] YASSER? IT'S THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, MAN. WHAT'S THE PROBLEM? Yasser: TYLER, LISTEN. I'VE BEEN KIDNAPPED. WHAT? THEY WANT YOU TO TRANSFER 1O MILLION DOLLARS U.S. BEFORE SUNRISE. IF YOU DON'T DO THIS, THEY SAY THAT I WILL BE KILLED. ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME? IS THIS SOME SORT OF JOKE? TYLER, DON'T DO IT. DON'T GIVE THEM ANY MONEY-- AH! I WOULD ADVISE YOU TO IGNORE YOUR FRIEND. UNLESS YOU COMPLY WITH OUR REQUESTS, WE WILL KILL HIM. WHO THE HELL IS THIS? I HAVE A BANK ROUTING NUMBER AND AN ACCOUNT NUMBER. UNLESS YOU WANT TO LOOK FOR A PERMANENT SUBSTITUTE TEACHER, I SUGGEST YOU WRITE THEM DOWN. Russell: GAYLE. GET IN. SO... WHAT DID YOU GET OUT OF OUR BOY? NOT MUCH. HE TOLD ME HE WENT DRIVING AND...STOPPED AT SOME OVERLOOK. SAW SOME VIEW OF THE CITY. SCOUTING POSSIBLE TARGETS? JESUS, I DON'T KNOW! GAYLE, NEXT TIME, YOU GET DETAILS. WHAT PART OR PARTS OF L.A. WERE THEY LOOKING AT SPECIFICALLY? WHO WAS HE WITH? OK, YEAH. I'LL JUST COME OUT WITH, UH, "HEY, HONEY!" "THE FBI'S GOT ME SPYING ON YOU "SO YOU BETTER TELL ME EVERYTHING OR ELSE!" WHY DON'T YOU ASK HIM YOURSELF? I MEAN, YOU GUYS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE WORKING TOGETHER, REMEMBER? YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU'RE RIGHT. THAT'S GOOD ADVICE. THAT'S WHAT I'LL DO. MEANWHILE [CLEARS THROAT]... WE'VE GOT A FEMALE UNDERCOVER TO WATCH YOUR BACK TONIGHT. AT THAT ISLAMIC SISTERHOOD MEETING WITH MINA. YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME. MM-MM. ANYTHING THAT KEEPS MINA DISTRACTED FROM DARWYN IS GOOD FOR HIM AND YOU, IF YOU WANNA KEEP CUSTODY OF YOUR CHILD. RIGHT. "OF COURSE IN THE END, WHEN THEY LET THEM FLY AWAY TOGETHER, "OUR LAST GLIMPSE OF HER SHOWS HER AT THE WINDOW, "WATCHING THEM RECEDING INTO THE SKY "UNTIL THEY WERE AS SMALL AS STARS." JUST ONE MORE STORY. PLEASE, MINA. NO, NO. BRUSH YOUR TEETH, GET INTO BED. IF YOUR MOM GETS HOME AND YOU TWO ARE STILL UP I'M IN TROUBLE. OK. HEY, GUYS. COME HERE. YOU BOTH KNOW I'M VERY FOND OF YOU, RIGHT? WE LOVE YOU, MINA. SURE WE DO. YOU'RE, LIKE, TOTALLY COOL. ALL RIGHT. GO AND CLEAN UP FOR BED. HEY, AND CODY? PUT TOOTHPASTE ON YOUR BRUSH TONIGHT. I'M GONNA SMELL YOUR BREATH AFTERWARDS, MISTER. [GRUNTING] AAH! AAH! WHO ARE YOU? ANSWER ME! ARE YOU CIA? *** [WOMAN SPEAKING SPANISH] NOTHIN' YET. JUST HAVE TO BE PATIENT. WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE, MAN? WHAT HAPPENED TO SAN ONOFRE? I FUCKING HATE CEMETERIES, MAN. THOSE HADITHS ABOUT HOW SINNERS ARE TORMENTED IN THEIR GRAVES SCARE THE SHIT OUT OF ME. ANGELS WITH COPPER NAILS SCRATCH THEIR FACES AND PULL THEIR EYES OUT FOR ETERNITY WHILE THE WALLS OF THE GRAVE, THEY CLOSE... STAY FOCUSED. WE HAVE AN IMPORTANT JOB TO DO. THE CONTENTS OF THIS GRAVE ARE OF GREAT VALUE TO US. YOU FUCKING LIED TO ME, DIDN'T YOU? I'M SORRY, DARWYN, BUT I WAS ONLY MAINTAINING OPERATIONAL SECURITY. THE SAME WAY YOU'VE BEEN DOING ALL THIS TIME. WHERE'S MINA? WHY ISN'T SHE HERE? SHE HAS HER OWN MISSION. DISTURBING THE DEAD IS HARAM. HE AIN'T GONNA COMPLAIN. *** THIS IS ALPHA STATION TO ALPHA REMOTE. DO YOU HAVE EYES ON THE ASSET AND THE TARGET? [WHISPERS] CHECK. COME ON IN, HONEY. WE'RE MUSLIMS, NOT ALIENS. [LAUGHTER] Gayle: OH, I... I WAS JUST SURPRISED TO SEE THAT NOT ALL OF YOU ARE WEARING THE HEADSCARF. HI, GAYLE. HI. THE HIJAB IS ONLY WHEN WE'RE OUT WITH STRANGE MEN. COS WE MUSLIM WOMEN ARE JUST TOO SEXY FOR OUR OWN GOOD. OK, THEN. AS-SALAAMU ALAIKUM. SISTERS. WA-ALAYKUM AS-SALAAM. I WANT TO WELCOME OUR NEW PARTICIPANT TO OUR GATHERING. GAYLE? HI. I REGRET TO INFORM YOU THAT YOU ARE NOW TRAPPED WITH THE MUSLIM FANATICS. THERE'S NO WAY OUT. JUST A LITTLE ISLAMOPHOBIA HUMOR. I GOT A MILLION OF THEM. BUT TONIGHT WE'RE HERE TO DISCUSS SOMETHING SERIOUS. PATIENCE FOR THE AMERICAN MUSLIM WOMAN. NOW, SISTER, YOU WROTE THE E-MAIL THAT PROMPTED TONIGHT'S DISCUSSION TOPIC. PLEASE SHARE. AFTER 9/11, PEOPLE WOULD LOOK AT ME AND STARE. SOMETIMES I WANT TO STOP WEARING MY HIJAB WHEN I GO OUT, BUT I FEEL LIKE I'D BE BETRAYING MY FAITH. WHAT DOES IT SAY IN THE HOLY QU'RAN ABOUT PATIENCE? HMPH. FUNNY YOU SHOULD ASK. "O YE WHO BELIEVE, "SEEK HELP WITH PATIENT PERSEVERANCE AND PRAYER "FOR ALLAH IS WITH THOSE WHO PATIENTLY PERSEVERE." *** Tyler: YASSER. YASSER! ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? YES, YES. THANKS TO YOU. OH, MY GOD. I THOUGHT YOU SUPPORTED OUR SCHOOL! I DO SUPPORT YOUR SCHOOL, MR. GRANGE. BUT IF YOU'RE GONNA TEACH SCHOOL IN THE DESERT, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO IT OUR WAY. I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW THAT I AM A FRIEND OF THE CHIEF OF THE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIVE DEPARTMENT OF THE YEMENI NATIONAL POLICE AND I PLAN ON REPORTING THIS CRIME TO HIM PERSONALLY. AS YOUR NEW BUSINESS PARTNER, I WOULD STRONGLY ADVISE AGAINST DOING THAT. IT'S BETTER YOUR SCHOOL STANDS HERE GATHERING DUST THAN IT BECOMES DUST. ARE YOU THREATENING ME? THERE ARE NO THREATS IN ARABIA, TYLER. JUST PROMISES. THINK OF YOUR DONATION AS AN ACT OF PHILANTHROPY. MAYBE YOUR ACCOUNTANT CAN USE IT AS A TAX WRITE-OFF. [SPEAKS ARABIC] *** [PHONE RINGS] RUSSELL. WAIT A MINUTE. A CEMETERY? WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? *** PRIVATE MARIO ORTIZ WENT TO IRAQ SEEKING GLORY. BUT WHAT HE FOUND WAS AN I.E.D. GUIDED BY GOD'S HAND. HE WAS JUST A FOOT SOLDIER FOLLOWING ORDERS. IN ANOTHER LIFE, I COULD'VE BEEN HIM. THEN THANK ALLAH THAT YOUR BOOK OF DESTINY WAS DIFFERENT. CAN WE JUST GET THIS SHIT DONE? AND GET THE FUCK OUTTA HERE? PLEASE? ONE, TWO, THREE... *** THE TOWNSPEOPLE, THEY'RE STAYING AWAY. THEY MUST HAVE HEARD THAT THE BROTHERHOOD IS AGAINST US. [CHATTER] *** I STILL SAY WE SHOULD HAVE BLOWN THAT DAMN SCHOOL UP. WE TOOK 10 MILLION DOLLARS OF HIS MONEY. PUSH A MAN JUST FAR ENOUGH AND YOU CAN GET WHAT YOU NEED AND DECLARE VICTORY. PUSH HIM TOO FAR AND YOUR ARROGANCE WILL TURN THAT VICTORY INTO DEFEAT. AZIZ? DID YOU GET THE MONEY I WIRED? GOOD. NOW, HOW DO I GET IN TO DISNEYLAND? [PHONE KEYPAD BEEPS] Darwyn: I'M NOT HERE, LEAVE A MESSAGE. DARWYN, WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU? RUSSELL MADE ME GO TO THIS MEETING WITH MINA AND I'VE BEEN STUCK WITH THE PSYCHO FOR HOURS. THIS SELF-RIGHTEOUS BITCH TRIED TO LECTURE ME ON MORALITY, CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? CALL ME AS SOON AS YOU GET THIS, OK? I LOVE YOU. [SPEAKS IN BOSNIAN] AIDA. WHERE IS GOD'S PARADISE? PARADISE IS IN THE SHADOW OF THE SWORDS. HOW IS MY ENGLISH NOW, PROFESSOR VOISLAV? YOUR BROTHER HAS BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU, ILIJA KORJENIC. WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? MY BROTHER IS DEAD. MY WHOLE FAMILY IS DEAD. YOUR BROTHER IS STILL ALIVE. AND WE ARE YOUR FAMILY. AS-SALAAMU ALAIKUM, ILIJA. I'VE MISSED YOU, MY BROTHER. THE CAUSE HAS MISSED YOU. THEY SAID YOU WERE DEAD. [LAUGHS] YOU SHOULD KNOW BY NOW, MY BROTHER. A MARTYR NEVER DIES. [SPEAKS ARABIC] DOESN'T EVEN LOOK OLD ENOUGH TO VOTE. BUT HE WAS OLD ENOUGH TO KILL MUSLIMS IN IRAQ. AND OLD ENOUGH TO DIE THERE. [CRACKLING] THIS, MY BROTHERS, IS THE NEXT SEPTEMBER 11TH.
