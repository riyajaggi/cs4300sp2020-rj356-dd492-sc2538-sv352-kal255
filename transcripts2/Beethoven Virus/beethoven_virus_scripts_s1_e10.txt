 {\an8}I'm referring to the other Gun-woo. Not the young, cute, nice, and handsome Gun-woo. But the old, nasty, selfish, twisted, and mean Gun-woo. I'm sorry, I wasn't trying to eavesdrop-- Say it again. Who? What's going on? She doesn't like you anymore. She likes me. What is it? Ask her later. Documents. Why are you here? Is it about conducting? Yes, I needed to ask you something about conducting.

 {\an8}FORTE CHOIR LEADER {\an8}It's the choir leader. Yes, sir. Did you leave? Sorry? You can't come? Look over here! - Pose for us! - Sure. - Move over. - Let's take it together. - Yes. - Hang on. - Okay. - Thank you. - Pose for us. - Look over here. Good grief. I can't believe it. It's been pouring for three days nonstop. Seriously.

 Look at that. Your heart must be torn, Mayor Kang. Look. The concert banners are all ruined. You can't even see the date. Everyone already knows about it anyway. You're right. But there's a weird rumor going on that the choir members fought with the conductor and quit. That you're performing the "Choral" without a choir-- Well, the better a business does, the more rumors fly about them. True, but I know of a restaurant which went out of business that way. Gosh, it's so sad. - Sir. - Yes? We're done here. Let's move out! Okay. All the orchestra members are highly qualified, right? Of course. All of them auditioned for the positions. They have award-winning experiences on their resume. Right. KIM GAP-YONG, AGE 65 HAS DEMENTIA BAE YONG-GI, AGE 35 PLAYED TRUMPET AT A CABARET Gosh. This got all wet. Thank you. Look into it. They misheard that the choir part will be determined after the rehearsal. Their ego won't allow it. Phone. I can't get a hold of him. His phone is turned off. Keep calling him and let me know once you get through. Should I go meet them? I heard they're gathered in the studio. Aren't you conducting the first score? Don't think of running away. Go change into your tux and let me check it. Excuse me. Hang on. Please let us perform. You took a tractor? How dare you take a tractor from the flooded area, you jerk! Let me take down my instrument! - It's rotting because it got wet! - Is your instrument all that's wet? - Our whole houses are submerged in water! - Hey. Please let us perform-- People are devastated because they lost their houses, but you'll sing and dance? Are you taunting us? Who's singing and dancing, you ignorant man? - It's a classical music performance! - Ignorant? Fine, I'll show you what real ignorance is. - Destroy their instruments. - Hey! Hey! Hey! WAITING ROOM - Is Gun-woo in? - Yes, he is. Hello? You saw my attitude earlier, right? I'm not interested in you, Ru-mi. So don't you dare mention anything to Gun-woo. I'm glad you're here. I need to call the choir, but my battery is low. May I borrow your phone? Sure, after I'm done with my call. I'm not saying to pretend to be nice to him. You need to stop liking me. Love? Emotions? It's all a hormonal prank. It can be controlled by trying. Okay. You know Gun-woo's conducting today, right? Act appropriately. Thanks. Who was that? Isn't it urgent? Oh, my. Where did the children... How's the concert preparation coming along? Was there any conflict with the flood victims? No. What's going on here? Shouldn't majority of the seats be filled up if it's 30 minutes before the show? Weren't the tickets all sold out? Well... Seokwu Industry bought group tickets but-- Seokwu Industry? I've heard that name before. It's Choi Seok-gyun's company! Yes, I think he deliberately bought the tickets to screw you over. That bastard... Sir, there's a fight outside. Sir! Sir! Sir! Come on! Come! You jerk! You're full of energy even though you didn't have anything to eat. Did something good happen to you? What? Sir, leave before something bad happens to you. Or you can't wait to see our performance? From your appearance, I doubt you've ever seen a classical music performance. Mr. Kang. Look at this jerk. Fine, then. Come watch. Each ticket is over 30,000 won. I'll consider it a donation to the flood victims. You bastard. - Hey! - Who the hell are you? Or should I consider it as charity? You... - What about almsgiving? - You bastard! - Mr. Kang! - Are you okay? How could you hit people? - Get out of my way. - Just talk it out! Get off! - How could you do that? - Doctor. - How long will it take for me to recover? - Let go. - Sorry? - Three weeks? Okay. He says it'll be three weeks. Do you want to go to the police and go through the boring process, or do you want to settle here? He needs to go through the boring process at the police station! I'd prefer settling. If you let us remove our instruments, I'll forget what happened. Let's go. I'm not interested in you, Ru-mi. So don't you dare mention anything to Gun-woo. You need to stop liking me. Yes. Try. It'll be fine if I try. The person you have reached is not available. Please leave... The choir leader is still not answering? Yes. What were you discussing with Mr. Kang? What? I got scolded. Why? For not practicing hard. Call the choir leader again. You're lying right now. I am not. You're watching, right? The theater isn't even half full. It's 20 minutes before the concert. We postponed it, so we have about an hour left. We can't rehearse, and we don't have a choir. Yes, I know you went through a lot to compose this piece. It took over ten years, and while you were deaf. Is that why you want me to suffer too? Are you testing me to see whether or not I'm qualified to conduct this piece? I want to ignore that jinx, but this is way too harsh! This time, so many things are happening left and right! What's that? I swear I heard something by the restroom. - That's mine. - You're here to party, right? My dad said you people are very bad because you're the ones who are preventing us from getting our food rations. Who's your dad? Joo Hyeon-cheol, the flood victim leader. So? Did your dad say you could steal everything from us because we're bad? Dad. Is it true, kid? - Did you go into his room to play hide-- - It's not that, Dad. I saw the sandwich and-- Did you steal it? He didn't steal it. I gave it to him. Who told you to eat that? Are you a beggar? Didn't I tell you to hold your head high no matter what happens to you? A man should keep his pride. How dare you... Stop crying! How much is the sandwich? Come and watch the concert instead. Tell me how much the sandwich costs. Whom are you asking to be seat fillers for your concert? I wouldn't say this if I were only trying to fill the seats. I would rather get nicely dressed extras. Why would I invite you? You might make a ruckus and make noise-- Good thing you brought it up. Should we make a ruckus? Should I whistle and yell? It'll be easier if I donate a portion of the proceeds to the relief fund. But if I do, does it eliminate the hunger pangs? Will that repair your hurt ego? Who's the one that's pissing me off? It's you. I'm referring to your son. Would you excuse us for a second, kid? Go ahead. Hang on. Did you see that? Do you think that's normal for a ten-year-old boy? He lost his home, he's hungry, kids tease him and he's miserable. But his dad tells him to keep his head high. It's a contradiction to the child. It's confusing! Your son didn't lose his house. Goodness. It's absurd to be lectured by a person who probably never hammered a nail in his entire life, Conductor. I have hammered a nail before. I don't mean hammering a nail to hang up a painting worth tens of millions of won. I lifted bricks and took out books from my demolished home. I couldn't save my house, so I lived in a container. I'm not just talking about your son. It happened to me too. Gosh, I'm going nuts. - Seriously. - Oh, no. The sound is terrible. I think you need a new instrument. I have to perform first! - Oh, no. - It won't work with glue. - Should I tape it? - Tape is no good. I need a temporary fix! Just our luck. - What's the matter? - I need to perform. Try this. Who is this, Yeong-ju? Is he your school teacher? Who is Yeong-ju? How would I know? It must be his secret lover. Mr. Kim. I should have stood up to greet you. My apologies. Mr. Kim Gap-yong! Have you heard of death breath? I found out what it was while handling an accident as a police officer. Death breath is a harsh breath that can be heard right before you die. If that happens, a person dies within three days. But I've seen someone live as long as a month. That's how important your mental determination is. Do you understand what I mean? Mr. Kang! How did your talk with the flood victims go? The mayor was very happy. We can fill in the empty seats and say it was a concert for the flood victims. That wasn't my intention. Most definitely. So are the flood victims coming to the concert? No, they're not coming. Is that so? Just in case, don't lock the doors during the concert. Sure. Did you get a hold of the choir? No. Where's Gun-woo? I haven't seen him either. Excuse me, sir. Gun-woo told me to wear this and get your approval. I'm so embarrassed. FORTE CHOIR LEADER MEAN GUN-WOO How could you just give him your car keys? Are you out of your mind? The person you have reached is not available. Please leave... He's not picking up. Make sure you get a hold of him and tell him he doesn't have to come. Tell him to pack up his things and go to Myeong-hwan. Are you okay? It's nothing. Is that the arm... Get out. Can't you see I'm changing? Why is your arm so swollen? They're muscles. Get out. You fell earlier. Are you sure it's not broken-- I told you I'm fine! You don't have to watch my every move. I'm fine. What's wrong with your foot? Did you sprain it? What? Yes. I slipped in the restroom and sprained it. Have a seat. I can fix this. - What's the matter with you? - Didn't you sprain it? What's this? It's for pressure points. I have neuralgia. What kind of pressure do you put on your feet to make it bleed? Are you trying to use pain to stay alert? Grandpa, what's wrong with you? Even a mosquito bite affects us from performing. How can you perform like this? I've performed all my life. I'm fine. - You made a mistake last time! - I won't make the same mistake twice! Yes. I know my mind has been coming and going, and I'm forgetting things one by one. But I've played the oboe for 50 years. I may be losing my mind, but it can't engulf all 50 years. I won't make a mistake, so don't worry. What's that? It's insurance. Even if you've memorized the score, you'd feel better with the sheet music in front of you. It's the same thing as that. It's okay. Lean on me. It doesn't hurt at all. It just tickles. What if you really get a sprained ankle by limping? Hurry, lean on me. - It's almost time to start. - He's here. Oh, my. It's so empty in here. Well, a nasty person bought all the tickets and wasted a good show. How's that possible? It must not have been publicized enough. Right, let me introduce you. Mr. Choi Ki-bong, the editor-in-chief of The Classic, the music magazine. He was the one who wrote a special article about Mr. Kang. I see. Thank you for coming. Please write a nice review of the concert. What are you asking me to do? Sorry? It's just a figure of speech. I didn't mean it that way. I evaluate according to how I see and feel. This is my job, so I hope you understand. Yes, I understand. - Sir! - Why are you... Didn't the concert start? The "Choral" is after the intermission. We have about an hour left. There was a misunderstanding about the rehearsal. It wasn't about testing the choir, but me. - He wanted to know if I could accurately-- - Let's... drop it. It's my fault. I should've worked harder. I know you did your best, Gun-woo. The problem is with the maestro. Yes, Mr. Kang is-- Let's just say he wasn't satisfied with us during the rehearsal. What happens to us then? Isn't it like, "You did great, but go home"? Oh, my. Bo-ra. What's wrong with your dad's instrument? What's that? Is that a new way of accessorizing your instrument? It's probably a temporary fix to bind his instrument. He must not take care of his instrument. I see. That's like a soldier not checking his gun before going off to war. It seems careless. The instrument arrangement is interestingly off and the mood is unsettled. I don't think they had a rehearsal. This isn't like Maestro Kang. Wasn't he thinking of not having a choir? Just perform without us. Sir. Gun-woo, what are you doing? I'm ashamed to say I've never really done anything right in my life. I did whatever I liked in school. I've never thought of majoring in trumpet. I did whatever I liked in the army and while I was looking for a job. That's how I always was. "I'm not the only one living like this. Everyone lives like this." So I thought it was fine to live like that. But Mr. Kang was the one who opened my eyes. He told me I could achieve something and shine. Maestro Kang is the one who had faith in me when I gave up on myself. But he's in a tough spot because he put me in charge. I'm begging you. Can you please help me? I know how you feel, but it's already too late. Everyone has already left. They left a long time ago. Gun-woo, where have you been? The first half of the concert was terrible! We messed up. We're totally ruined. Do you know why I hit you? I'm sorry. I went to see the choir... They had already left, right? Did you know? - Mayor Kang, the choir... - What? What? The choir! By the way. What happens if there is no choir for Beethoven's "Symphony No. 9 'Choral'"? It makes no sense. Beethoven is the first composer who added people's voices to an all-instrumental score, and that's the "Choral." A choir has to be present. I see. Just like how Beethoven made a remarkable attempt, can you consider the choral symphony without a choir a remarkable attempt-- Yes, it's a very remarkable attempt. It's so remarkable, that once the music world finds out, that musician's career would be over immediately. The musician's career... The musician's career is over? The choral symphony will be performed without a choir. The choir leader said he'll contact the others, but they've dispersed a long time ago, so most likely, they won't come. They say the performance on stage is worse than the worst practice. We don't have many guests, so it's not as exciting. Our instruments aren't in good condition, and we even have a patient. In other words, our concert may end as a complete mess. Then wouldn't it be better to tell the audience and stop the concert? - You have a jinx-- - Do you know why a jinx exists? It's to break it! I would've stopped the concert if you were regular orchestra members. But I'm pushing forward because it's you! Why? Because you're weeds! Haven't you experienced this before? And didn't you overcome it? God gives suffering only to those who can prevail. Therefore, we're God's chosen people. Let's go. Let's go and show them what kind of wonderful and amazing people we are! Let's go! We can do it. We can do it. Sir. - We can do it. - We can do it. - What are you doing? - Man, it's true. Give me your arm. What did you hear? I'm-- Ru-mi ran outside and bought this for you. I thought she was lying, but it's true. Excuse me. May we go watch the concert? - My child wants to-- - Why would you go there? We can't go fill in empty seats for a guy who pissed us off. Maybe if we go to make a ruckus. Make a ruckus. I don't care. You either watch the performance or make a ruckus. Do whatever you want. The doors are open. Really? You gave us permission, right? Did you hear that? Let's go! Let's go. But still, it's a concert... I'm not just talking about your son. It happened to me too. What are you saying? You used to be like a flood victim like me, so you want my understanding? No way. I wasn't a flood victim. My family was poor, but I was very smart and did well in school. I was the class president many times. There's one bad thing about being smart. You realize how the real world works at a very young age. One day, it just hit me. People who work hard don't get respect. The rich become richer and the poor get poorer. Therefore, I'll be in this rut for the rest of my life. That's why I became pompous. I held up my head higher than a President's son. I think this is what I wanted to tell the whole world. I wasn't poor by choice. Poverty wasn't originally mine. That guy was the conductor? - Yes. - I see. Why? Do you want to go see? What? No. I endured it, but it was useless when my house was flooded. No longer was there a studious and arrogant child. After that day, I lived in a container. I was dirt poor, but I was too prideful to receive any type of help. Back then... Yes, I tried to kill myself. And I resented my mom for throwing me into such an awful world. There was one way out. Leaving this despicable world with my mom. My mom was completely paralyzed. I had to remove her phlegm every three minutes, so she could breathe. I didn't have to do anything. I just had to sit and wait ten minutes. That very moment... I heard something from the other room. It was the most beautiful music I've ever heard. It's true. I don't know if it was a dream or a fantasy, but I saw an orchestra. I also saw myself conduct the orchestra in the far future. It was salvation, consolation, and strength. And I... became a conductor. Weren't you going to create a ruckus? I will. You can clap. No, I won't. It's etiquette to clap after a performance. It's also a response to the impression you received. Your dad was moved. I hope you could all feel the same consolation and strength that I received that day. Gosh. Great job, everyone. It was incredible! Where's Mr. Kang? The editor-in-chief wants to meet him. Wonderful! It was incredible. Mr. Kang, are you sleeping? He must have been exhausted. Mr. Kang, Mayor Kang and an editor-in-chief want to see you. Mr. Kang. Mr. Kang. Mr. Kang! You fractured your arm. You fainted as soon as the concert was over and Gun-woo carried you here. Are you awake now? Did the choir perform? Yes, they did. Your memory must be fuzzy because you passed out for so long. Didn't everyone leave? How did you-- I called everyone. They must have felt bad about refusing to perform. They came running as soon as I called. Six or seven people were missing, but you couldn't tell. To tell you the truth, I really didn't plan to perform. But... You have a really good pupil. He keeps sleeping. Did you give him the wrong medication or something? He must have been really tired. We gave him the correct medication. He has been sleeping for 36 hours. That's a day and a half! It's not like he's a bear hibernating. How could a person sleep that long? I slept that long? See? He's up. How was the concert? I heard the choir performed, but I don't remember. The editor-in-chief who wrote bad things about you came. He must have been excited to say something bad again. He even wrote an article in the paper. ...WITH SEOKRAN ORCHESTRA "The performance level was impeccable. Kang Gun-woo's Seokran Symphony Orchestra faced many obstacles head-on and won. He'll be remembered as a role model for putting on a touching performance and giving hope to the flood victims." Aren't you going to study? You've read that numerous times. - Take this. - No, I don't want it! It's good for your throat. If you take it a few times, your cough will die down. Here. Man... - Here. - Thank you. - Thank you. - What about me? You need to lose weight first. I'll lose the weight slowly. I'm short. - Give it. - Thank you! Give it. - He's going to give it to Ju-hui. - Oh, my! Isn't this part really good? "For putting on a touching performance and giving hope to the flood victims." - It's so sweet. - You'll memorize it soon. I hear magazines and TV stations are calling to interview him. Yes, but he refused them all. It's evident what Maestro Kang will do on TV. He'll point at each camera and say, "C-R-A-P." True. - By the way, Ru-mi. - Yes? Can you select some CDs in the conductor's office for me? - Sure. - Thanks. Gun-woo. - He's coming. - Okay. What's up? Did you fight with Ru-mi? No. You guys looked pretty serious that day. At the concert? Oh, that was nothing. Did you celebrate your 100-day anniversary? What 100-day anniversary? See? He doesn't know because he's a guy. Teach him. He's dense when it comes to those things. - Hurry. - Listen to what I say. We have something planned. - No way. - Listen to me. This will work for sure. - It'll seal the deal. - No, I can't do it! Would you rather be embarrassed once and keep her or lose her willingly? - Make a choice. - I won't do it. - Hey. - Hey. - Why can't you do it? - What's wrong with you too? - Come on. - This is for your own good. - Girls like this. - No. - How can I do that? - Girls like it. - They really do? - Absolutely. Can I get some CDs... I read your article, but if you called to hear a thank you-- That's not it at all. I don't expect you to. I was concerned with what Assemblyman Choi told me. Was one of your members involved in a 300-million-won scandal? He said it was a former city employee. - Not only that, - I'm going to go upstairs - to get more CDs. - I heard something about dementia, cabaret, and high school something. The most important issue is the 300 million won. You probably aren't worried because you have nothing to do with the money, but it's a huge problem if one of the members embezzled 300 million won. It wasn't embezzlement. That person was scammed. You knew about it? It wasn't intentional. It was a mistake. That person is working harder than everybody else. That performance's value exceeded 300 million won. But that's not what others think. Money problems will damage your image and the orchestra's image. I don't care about my image. Most of all, it'll be bad for that person. Assemblyman Choi is preparing to report it to the Prosecutors' Office. You should get rid of that person from the orchestra. Mr. Kang. I'll get going now. Ru-mi. You've performed once, right? Please leave. Most of all, it'll be bad for that person. Assemblyman Choi is preparing to report it to the Prosecutors' Office. You should get rid of that person from the orchestra. If it's because of that incident, I'm making an effort right now. I'm offended! The more I think about it, I feel like I'm covered in garbage! You're too frivolous. Are you trying to hit on everyone with your looks? Besides, it's Gun-woo. Are you trying to make me a scumbag who steals his pupil's girlfriend? I feel nasty to know a person like you is in my orchestra. Get out. Submit your letter of resignation by Monday. He's so mean. Aren't you going to come out? I'm not feeling that great. Is that right? But still, in a little bit, Ru-mi and Gun-woo... Never mind. You don't like childish games like that, right? Just rest. I'll bring you some meat once it's done. Ru-mi, where were you? I was looking for you everywhere. Mr. Kim Gap-yong has lost his mind again. - What? - Hurry. Let's run. - Where is he? - Hurry. Hurry. - She's coming. - She's coming! You used me, didn't you? Why do you keep doing that? - I can't do it. - Come on. Ru-mi. Do you know how long we've been dating? About 100 days? Can you be a little bit more romantic? What the heck is that? Are you collecting debt? - Please be quiet. - Then kick it up a notch. Are you pissed off at me because I didn't know we were going out for 100 days? - Be more romantic! - Seriously. Don't pick a fight. Okay. What's that? If I were her, I would've thrown it. Come on. - Accept it. - Kiss. Kiss! - Can you please knock it off? - Kiss! Kiss! Take it. It's embarrassing. Thanks. Ru-mi is crying. She must have been touched, right? She's crying a lot. She's crying way too much. Why are you crying? She must be happy. Isn't the meat done? Why aren't you giving me any? Oh, that's right. The meat will burn. - Please sit and wait a minute. - Please sit down. A little later. You need to leave. I just got fired. Who else should I fire next? What are you doing? I need to live. I'm planning on reporting Ru-mi. He's going to report Ru-mi? She'll go deaf while in prison. Will you resign when you get back? I don't deserve to be called that. What do you want? The person Ru-mi likes. We eliminated that policy. Thanks for everything you've done. Did we just get fired? Mr. Kim! Maestro said he'd find a way somehow if your evaluation results are good there. Let's have fun practicing. We decided not to participate. These are the characteristics of a beggar. I was wondering what those people looked like, and that's you! This is the last time I'll be seeing you. Your master is just imitating music. He needs to be honest. You're doing well, right? Maestro Kang likes you. Mr. Kang, I think I like you.
