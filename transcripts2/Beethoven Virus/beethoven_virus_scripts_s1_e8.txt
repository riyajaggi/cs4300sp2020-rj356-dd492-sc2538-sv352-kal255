 Do you know what it means to be deaf? {\an8}People next to you will be mute. {\an8}You can't converse! {\an8}You can't hear the birds in the mountains and can't hear the waves in the sea. {\an8}You can't hear thunder and cars will ram into you! {\an8}Most of all, music will disappear! Your violin! Acoustic neuroma? It's the perfect illness for you! Hey, stop right there! Who are you to lecture me? What did you learn all these years?

 You don't even know what a real setback is yet you act cool as if you've overcome it. You're tacky, simple-minded, and vain to think you're an amazing woman. It didn't hit me yet, that's all. You were in denial. I really didn't know what to do. Then I'll tell you. Jump in. Do you see the lake? Isn't it blue? It's very deep, and there's no end to it. On top of that, it's murky. No one's going to help you, and you'll just have to die. That's despair, tribulation, and reality. You need to go through all that in order to face your illness. Why don't you jump in? See? You're all talk.

 Fine, I'll do it. Hey! Ru-mi! What's going on here? That stupid Ru-mi! Ru-mi, where are you? Hello? Hello? Is anyone there? What's wrong? - Did someone fall in? - Yes. Someone fell in. It's been over a minute. How can you just stand there? Can't you swim? Hey, Ru-mi! Ru-mi, snap out of it! You know how to drive. You can't swim? You're so mean. You made me jump in the water, and you didn't even save me. If it weren't for that guy, I could've died. Why were you holding a pole? Did you poke it into the water? So I can grab it? Did you faint? I'm not sure whether I passed out or was dreaming. I saw a string quartet concert. But I couldn't hear them. Perhaps because I was in the water. It must have hit you now. It was similar to what I had imagined. It was deafening, and I felt like I was in a cave. I liked it because it was quiet. I felt at peace. But it was a bit lonely. It was very lonesome. I felt like I was cut out from the rest of the world alone. Right this way. Why do you have so much wine? It varies depending on the grape, weather, and soil. Is this the most expensive German wine? Yes. - How much is it? - It's 145,000 won. I see. How much is this? That's 135,000 won. Is this not it? How much is this? It's 95,000 won. Would you like that? That can't be it. It must be this one. How much is this? If you're looking for cheap wine, I have 18,000-won wines over there. Really? Come take a look. - Excuse me? - Yes. I'll just take that. The 145,000-won bottle? Yes. Are you buying it for someone important? Yes, please gift wrap it for me. I have to serve and learn from him for the rest of my life. Should I divide it into 12 payments? No. Yes. Did you make this? I can't believe you made soup for me. It was worth falling into the water. Were you always this stupid? How could you jump in just because I teased you? Didn't it occur to you that you could die? Didn't you say to jump in? If I didn't, you would've given me a hard time about it. You believed me? It was just a slightly harsh warning. Why did you warn me? Why should you care whether a mere orchestra member goes deaf or not? You usually couldn't care less. Are you done? What were you thinking when I didn't surface? You looked around, right? So you could run away if there weren't any witnesses. You panicked when someone showed up, right? In case you'd get arrested for assisted suicide. Were you thinking of my requiem by any chance? "I should conduct a beautiful funeral march during the funeral. Then I could be absolved of my sins." Am I right? I thought I'd never see you again. I mean I had fun teasing you, but I wouldn't have been able to anymore. Why are you so tense? I see. Isn't it warm in here? I've been sweating... Why don't you take a shower? Pardon? Shower? You jumped in crap water. The smell is permeating throughout the whole house. Wash up. What should I do? My clothes are wet. It's a little big. What are you doing here? Well... I took a shower and my clothes were wet. A shower? Here? Why? Well, I fell into the water and lost my keys, so Mr. Kang lent me his clothes-- There was a car accident. An accident? Don't let him take it the wrong way. Shut your mouth. That's right, accident. I went to go pick him up and suddenly... A car came up from behind and didn't you say you couldn't hear again? Yes. I couldn't hear because of the ringing in my ear and the other car hit me. Did you get hurt? No, I didn't get hurt, but... She was thrown into the water. That's right. I got wet because I fell in the water-- Isn't your car parked outside? It looks fine to me. Well... She borrowed her friend's car, and that's the car that got hit. What's with the questions? Are you saying we're lying to you? No. I was just concerned. - What happened to you? - Sorry? Why did you come back? Did Myeong-hwan kick you out already? This is the cost of tuition. Of course, this is nothing, but I want to learn from you. Why? Well... Did you hear something? Yes, Mr. Jung told me... Why that jerk. That you bad-mouthed me. That I was ignorant and pompous. You told him to teach this cocky jerk a lesson. I came back because I was bitter. I wanted to show you that you were wrong. I'm going to learn all your conducting techniques by staying right next to you. I'm even going to make you admit, "Gun-woo's a pretty good kid." So watch out. Why must I do that? I'm going to study to go to college while being a backup orchestra member. I'm going to debut as a conductor, receive awards, and get recognition. Who said I wanted to hear your plans? What will I gain-- After becoming a wonderful conductor, I'm going to go see Mr. Jung and say you were the one who taught me, that you were the reason I am what I am. That the best conductor in the world isn't Jung Myeong-hwan, but... Maestro Kang Gun-woo. I'm going to tell the whole world. Don't smile. Let's have some wine. I'll get the glasses. It's still morning. Forget it. Gun-woo. My oldest brother is your age. I just wanted to call you that once. I have an older sister. I'm the only son. I don't have any younger siblings. I'll assist you forever, sir. {\an8}CULTURAL LIBRARY OPENING COMMEMORATIVE PERFORMANCE Wow, Yong-jae O'Neill is so amazing. Mr. Kang recruited him. They must have worked together before. Is he famous? Yes, he received the prestigious Avery Fisher Career Grant. He performed with the London Philharmonic. He was the first Korean violist at Julliard. He's teaching at UCLA right now. Talk to me in lay terms. Anyhow, he's very impressive. Impressive? That's easy. Impressive. What are you doing? Did you not practice? How did you not improve at all since last year? Have you been slacking off on your tours? I'm sorry. Let's do that again. Again. Even Yong-jae O'Neill gets criticized. How could Mr. Kang be pleased with commoners like us? "Symphony No. 9 'Choral.'" It's time for us to part. My butt is calling you to be my cushion. Mr. Kim is a backup member, but Maestro Kang asked him to play. So we-- He was with the Seoul Philharmonic for 30 years. I played at a cabaret for ten years. The difference is like a marathon, 42.195 km. It won't happen. Besides, Mr. Kim is temporarily taking the place of the first oboist whose dad has passed away. I don't see him. - Did he go somewhere? - You're right. He said he was going to the restroom. Why hasn't he come back yet for the rehearsal? - That was a long time ago. - What? I'll look for him. Mr. Kim! Mr. Kim Gap-yong! Where are you, sir? Mr. Kim! Mr. Kim! What are you doing here? You need to rehearse. Yes, sir. It's my first day, so I don't know where the practice room is. Where is it? We're not in the practice room today. We're performing at the library. We're performing on the first day? I knew the Seoul Philharmonic was going to be different, but this is unexpected. Sir, this isn't the Seoul Philharmonic. It's Seokran... Why are you suddenly being so formal to me? I must have dozed off. It brought back old memories... We're rehearsing? Move over. It's not like you rented this spot. Why did you come? You should be studying. Aren't you taking the GED? This is a library. I was studying until now. That guy is Yong-jae O'Neill? He looks decent. Be quiet. Really? I have dementia. No, not yet. I had brain damage, so the possibility of me getting dementia is high. What are you doing, Grandpa? Aren't you coming out? By the way, this is the ladies room. I thought something happened to you because you wouldn't come out. What are you doing? Should I wash your hands for you? Why aren't you studying? I'll leave once you give me an answer. What's my name, Grandpa? I'm fine. Don't treat me like a moron over a foolish mistake. I know, but you haven't said my name all day. Do you remember my name? Your name? Vivaldi. It's a joke, I-deun. I'm still fine. You scared the hell out of me because I thought you lost your mind! I don't have dementia yet. Why would I? Who am I? I'm Kim Gap-yong. I know. You're Kim Gap-yong. They're so absurd! What? Did someone say I have dementia? No. Just because of your age, Grandpa. You. Does that look like the ladies' room? The ladies' room was full, that's why. Pee in the grass if you really have to go. He didn't hear, right? Isn't it fabulous? Beethoven's "Symphony No. 9 'Choral.'" My heart starts pounding whenever I hear this. Seokran Philharmonic's start. Rejoice. It fits perfectly with that concept. Yes. According to a survey of the people of Seokran, this was selected as the piece they want to hear most. Sir, are you listening to me? I'd like this score to be the main theme song for... That's impossible. It's a big-scale score. What do you mean it's a big-scale score? Are you underestimating Seokran's abilities? The orchestra members just started to play together. We need to go with smaller scale scores with substance. But the "Choral" will require me to oversee the choir practice and I'll need guest performers-- Don't you have guest performers? The ones who pulled off that amazing concert. They're not even close to being guest performers. They were quite good. Why... Yes, I heard. Something bad happens whenever you perform the "Choral." What was it? When you were performing the "Choral" at Carnegie Hall with the New York Philharmonic-- Yes, it was in 2001. The concert was canceled due to the 9/11 terrorist attacks. It was a tragedy. Yes, but didn't that happen again? One of the members suddenly had a heart attack - right before-- - I said it was an accident. Yes, but if accidents keep recurring, doesn't it become a jinx? A fate? That wasn't all, right? Last year... I'm a lucky charm. I don't believe in bad luck. If there is such a thing, it avoids me. So don't worry about that. I'm not worried about it. I believe you're more concerned-- That's right. I don't believe in jinxes, but I always keep my members' abilities in mind. That's why I can't perform the "Choral." Didn't I tell you I'm short on members and the skill level of the guest performers are not-- Why don't you test them? Don't you think if it's a performance to kick start the Seokran Philharmonic, we should play something the people of Seokran want to hear? It's not like we don't have the budget. That's right. - We can get a choir. - That's right. - You're talented. - Absolutely. The jinx is a bit of a concern, but since you don't believe in it... - Pass. - Pass? Can't you perform that piece if you have talented guest performers? Yes, my point exactly! Why don't you test how good the guest performers are? If they're good, then okay? Hey. Maestro Kang wanted to see us. What's going on? A test? Do you know anything? I don't know either. That's right. This is a gift for you. It's from Ru-mi and me. Hang in there. Relax. I just wanted to see how good you are. I don't expect you to do well, so those who aren't confident can either rest or leave. - Do whatever you want. - Okay. You wouldn't be taking this test if it weren't for me. Just so you know. Do your best. Break a leg. It's the "Choral." It's the "Choral"! The "Choral." It's the score we practiced like crazy. You're going down. Grandpa, you're a prophet. This is totally-- Be quiet. Is there a problem? Well, isn't this the "Choral"? How can we play this difficult score at one try? I'm sorry, but can you change this to something else? Gosh, it's so complicated. I can't do it. This is so unfair. The "Choral" is too difficult. Let's do something easier. Do we have to sing as well? Just play it. I don't expect much, so don't worry about it. Okay, let's begin with the fourth movement measure 156. They practiced. They've been practicing for a month since they came in as backup members under Mr. Kim Gap-yong's guidance. According to my notes, they practiced - from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. every day. - Oh my gosh, unbelievable. That traitor. That snake. He acts exactly like how he looks. I want to know what they practiced. - Pardon? - Did they practice this and that? Or did they practice only Beethoven's "Symphony No. 9 'Choral?'" Well, so... They just practiced the "Choral," right? Hang on... Here it is. Beethoven's "Symphony No. 9 'Choral.'" "Pomp and Circumstance March," Vivaldi's "The Four Seasons 'Autumn, '" "The Marriage of Figaro." They practiced the "Choral," but they only played it once on October 30th. Just once. Aren't your sheet music worn out? I heard you practiced this all month long. Hyeok-gwon didn't tell me. That was my guess, so I threw it out there and you took the bait. She refused to get surgery. She said if she's going deaf anyway, she wants to play for an orchestra while she can still hear. If she doesn't do anything about it, she'll hear for maybe another four months. Fine, let's do it. I took note that you practiced one month, not that you practiced just one score. It's not easy to do this well in a month. You've improved. Great job. Excuse me. Does that mean we can perform? Yes, I'll believe in your potential. Why? Don't you want to do it? Maestro Kang is the best! - Tell Mr. Kim we'll do the "Choral." - Yes, sir. - And add them to the list of musicians. - Yes, sir. Practice will start tomorrow morning. - Yes, sir. - And... Mr. Kim Gap-yong. You know you can't perform, right? Why not? Don't you have dementia? What do you mean dementia? Ru-mi, do you get what he's saying? There's no way Grandpa... What's wrong? What rumor has been going around that you're like this? Are you saying Grandpa really has dementia? That's right. You're the first one who brought it up in the restroom. Don't you remember? Thanks for everything. You don't need to come anymore starting tomorrow. I'm fine. Tell the doctor. I don't know what to say because I'm only a conductor. No, I promise you I don't have dementia. Let's just say you have hemorrhoids. I still need you to quit. I'm well aware of your talent. I asked you to be a regular member of the orchestra even with your age. But now, I'm asking you to quit. Why do you think that is? I wonder. I have no idea. You know about the library incident. I made a mistake at that performance. I-deun was mistaken. I'm not talking about that. Weren't you lost right before the concert? You even spoke formally to Gun-woo. You thought the library was the Seoul Philharmonic and went back 30 years in time. Isn't that clearly dementia? Did you take a time machine or something? I dozed off on a bench. - And in my dream-- - What if that happens during a concert? Can you guarantee you won't jump up in the middle of the concert? You're a ticking bomb to me. I can't keep you. Give me another chance. If I make another mistake, I'll quit right then and there. I can't do that. I'd rather use a street performer than you. They're fine after performing ten hours straight. Talent is important, but so is the ability to perform. I need someone who's talented and physically and mentally healthy. But you're not, sir. You have dementia, right? No, I don't! Would it be different if I say I do? I'll be kicked out anyway. My son and daughter-in-law living in Japan will come and put me - in a hospital until I die-- - What will change if you resist? I can at least fight. I'm an educated man. I don't care about money, but dignity, pride and honor are very sacred to me. But you think I'll lose my mind? You're saying I'll be pooping and peeing in my pants, cursing people for no reason, starting fires, and getting lost? And you're saying I won't remember what I did? That's hell! How could I become no better than a dog... I don't have dementia. I won't allow it to happen. What can you do? It's reality. He's the same as me. What's the difference between me going deaf and Mr. Kim getting dementia? I just thought it was over for Mr. Kim... Man, I'm the worst. - You idiot. - Hey. I feel so terrible. Is there any way? - Ru-mi. Look over there. - What? Grandpa. Grandpa. You're driving me mad. What are you trying to pull? Do you think this will change anything? Grandpa. I can't do that. I'd rather use a street performer than you. They're fine after performing ten hours straight. Grandpa! I need someone who's talented and physically and mentally healthy. But you're not, sir. Don't tell me he's going to perform on the street for ten hours. Mr. Kang. Mr. Kang. Great. I finally fell asleep for the first time in two days. Thanks for waking me up. What's the matter? Do you know that Mr. Kim Gap-yong is performing on the street right now? You just hesitated, right? You felt bad, right? You know, people's true character can be seen while they're sleeping. But you looked really nice. What will you do now? You got caught. You got caught red-handed for being nice. You get hurt easily, right? You're very tenderhearted, right? You think about something somebody said all day, right? But it's embarrassing because it doesn't seem very manly. Isn't that why you guard yourself so people won't see that side of you? "I'm scary. Don't come closer. I don't want to get hurt. Stop bothering me!" Slap. That was amusing. Now, leave. Am I wrong? There are many different kinds of people. There are people like you who are full of sentiment, so you can't help but sugarcoat people like me and there are people like me who hate words like loyalty, sentiment, and love. Tell Mr. Kim Gap-yong to not only play for ten hours but for a month, a year. I won't bat an eye. Really? Then I'll applaud you. There may be people who try to be mean. But no one in this world is purely evil. Especially not people who look sweet when they're sleeping. Fine, next time I'll show you me grinding my teeth as I sleep. Don't wait a month or a year. I want you to withstand the ten hours Mr. Kim Gap-yong is enduring. If you really don't bat an eye, I'll dance outside naked. Saying, "Hurray for Maestro Kang!" Yes, that will be amusing. Hope you succeed. Good luck! Thank you. - Thank you. - Did you call these people? - Why did you do that? - You must be upset. Please love us. The weak need to help each other out. We called and asked what happened. Mr. Kim, ten hours is too long. How about a 70 percent discount and do just three hours? Did you call your children-- What? Still, his children ought to know-- Hello? Hi, Gun-woo. - Maestro Kang? - Maestro Kang? What about Maestro Kang? Okay, bye. - Maestro Kang's coming. - What? Maestro Kang? - Excuse me. - You're leaving? - He's coming. - You too? You're such cowards. I don't care if he comes. I won't run away. He doesn't scare me! - Take her and leave. - I'm not leaving! Same here. I can't go. I won't go. I'm a very loyal guy. I'll be by your side. She didn't eat breakfast. Buy her something to eat. Take her. Yes, I'll take her, but I'll be here in spirit. Let's go. - No, I'm not leaving! - You're not running away. - It's a strategic retreat. - I'm not leaving, Grandpa! I'm not leaving! - It's a strategic retreat. - I'm not leaving! - Grandpa! - It's a strategic retreat. Do as I say! I swear it was around here somewhere. Where are you taking me to eat? We're almost here. Which way was it? Is it this way? Mr. Kim Gap-yong's over there. I wonder what he's doing there. What about over there? It looks good. What are you trying to pull? I made a bet with Ru-mi. Ru-mi said you'll crack and accept Mr. Kim Gap-yong. I said you couldn't care less. We bet 50,000 won. It's a lot of money for unemployed people like us. So you need to resist, okay? What are you doing here all day? Please pack up and go. You're pushing it. - You didn't say anything earlier. - No more. Please pack up and leave. - Hurry up! - That's mean of you. People complained about the noise. - I need you to pack up and leave now. - Where can I perform? Go over there or somewhere, but not here. Take your stuff. Hurry up. Please go. I heard he was playing since 11 a.m. My, it's already been eight hours. Did you see him lose balance? I bet it's exhausting. I can't get him any water, right? No, don't get it for him no matter what happens to him. What do you think you're doing? There are plenty of other spots. Why here? Please leave! I'm sorry. Just a while longer. Customers are coming right now. I won't give you a while longer! We're creating a fun mood, and you're ruining it! I'm sorry. I need to keep a promise. I'll play somewhere else after 30 minutes. - I'm sorry. - Is it because of money? Should I give you 10,000 won? You made a lot of money. You're richer than I am. How much is all this? Please don't kick it. I've had this bag for 30 years. What? I can't believe this! Hey, come here! Yes, sir. Do you want to leave on your own or do you want to be dragged away? Well... Let's do this. I'll play for 30 more minutes, and I'll play for you inside. It's Mozart's oboe concerto. Who plays classical music at a bar? It's a complete buzz kill! I'll play you an upbeat song instead. - Hey, take him. - Yes, sir. - Come here. - Don't do this. Get rid of this too. Take your hands off of him. Move your feet too. Even my dog doesn't walk over instruments. How dare you kick that? Didn't you learn any manners? Who are you? I conduct classical music that kills your buzz. This gentleman is the first oboist in my orchestra. What the heck is he saying? Do you have a permit to blast music and solicit people with go-go dancers? Do you? I can't believe the nerve you both have. Hey, get rid of him too! - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. There's no permit for this. It's 100 percent illegal. He's an ex-cop. He's an expert regarding these things. - Report him. - Sure. Thanks for your hard work. This is Kang Gun-woo. I'm at Taepyung Road in the 88th district. They're blasting music and illegally soliciting people with go-go dancers. Why aren't you reporting him? He was noisy too! Why don't you report him? They'll mobilize now. They want to know our exact location. Tell them to look it up on the map. Why would I tell you? Why don't you answer the phone? You're not the only one who has a phone. I have one, too. Tell them I'll call! Is it the Seokran Police Station? Just you wait and see. I'm going to call. You played for exactly 9 hours and 35 minutes. Tomorrow's practice starts at 9 a.m. It'll be pretty strenuous. Be sure to rest up. Are you accepting me? I'm keeping the back door open. The hardest is yet to come. Do you have dementia? No, I don't. You have 25 minutes left to perform. Thank you, sir! Persistent bastard. Hello. Hi. I'm Bae Yong-gi who'll play the trumpet perfectly during Beethoven's "Symphony No. 9 'Choral.'" Nice meeting you. Hi. - Let's make an awesome ensemble. - Hello. I'm Jung Hui-yeon. Pardon me. I look forward to working with you. Concertmaster-- Hello, I look forward to working with you. Stop! What's wrong? Horn, you need to rest half a note and play slower. Flute, come in on time. Don't hesitate. Okay. - That is tutti sforzando! - Yes. Trumpet, pose accurately or don't do it at all. We received the music today. For you to expect a perfect performance-- You've never heard of the "Choral"? Is it the first time you've ever played it? What makes someone a professional? You're paid to perform! Do you consider yourselves to be professionals right now? You're worse than the guest musicians! We must have been good. "What makes someone a professional? You're paid to perform! You're worse than the guest musicians!" Wasn't Maestro Kang wonderful today? He was the best. - Not because he scolded the pros? - Most definitely. What other reason could there be? Don't we have practice tomorrow night? What time should we meet? What about around 5 p.m.? Sure. Where? My battery is dying, Ru-mi. I'll call you right back. Okay. So where should we meet? At home. Home? Maestro Kang is at home. What's wrong with me being at my own home? Maestro Kang? You call me that instead of "Mr. Kang"? Mr. Kang. - So... - What are you doing tomorrow? Sorry? My music sheets got detached. Come tape them if you have the time. - How about 5 p.m.? - Well... I have plans tomorrow with Gun-woo. Really? I can postpone my plans... Oh, but Gun-woo can't make it during the day. Let me give him a call-- Hello? Hello? Hi, it's me. - Our call dropped. - Yes, I hung up. I see. I don't think I can make it tomorrow because I have plans with Gun-woo-- I know, don't come. But your sheet music... What about now? Why? It's good. The part you were just conducting is good. The conducting I did in my head? You heard that? Well, I felt it. Which part did you hear? Aren't you conducting the third movement andante moderato 3/4 time? Am I right? Am I really? That's cool. We were thinking the same thing. I must be psychic. How was it? How was what? You said you heard the music I was conducting. How was it? Well, let's see... It sounded lonely and sad. Kind of like looking at someone's back. Strong but lonely. But cool. And cute. Also pitiful. So I want to hug... Not you, the music. Keep on taping. Okay. Why don't you smile? We haven't been on a date in a long time. Sorry. What? Date? Isn't it? We had dinner and watched a movie. Am I mistaken? Of course, it is. Are you mad? Ru-mi, what's wrong? Are you okay? The ringing... I'm okay now. That scared me. Who is this guy? He's so awesome. Right, Ru-mi? Ru-mi. Ru-mi. Ru-mi! Gun-woo. Where did he go? Ru-mi! Ru-mi! Gun-woo! Gun-woo! Mr. Kang, did Ru-mi come-- - What? - She isn't here. What are you talking about? She had some problems with her hearing, and then she vanished. I can't reach her. She doesn't have a phone. Don't you remember it's broken? She's gone. I looked for her everywhere. It's been over an hour, and I can't find her. You must have missed each other. Wait inside. You don't know. Her hearing-- I know. She's going deaf. She's not deaf yet. She's fine now. Why are you overreacting? She'll either call your cell or our home phone. It's almost time for practice. She might be heading there. Doesn't Ru-mi live at your aunt's house? What's the number? Didn't you say this before? That the hardest thing to know is yourself. It's true. I know now. What do you mean? I just thought she was cute and pretty, but I realized after she disappeared. Ru-mi must have occupied a huge part of my heart. I'll go look for her some more. Are you really okay? Yes, except for a slight headache. Actually, I didn't even hit you. I slammed on my breaks, but you passed out. How long was I passed out? Well... About an hour and a half? Oh no, Gun-woo... You're really fine, right? Yes. You can go. - Okay, I'll go then. - Bye. - Take care of yourself. - I will. You haven't found Ru-mi yet? Did you go to the spot where you first lost her? I went there twice, and she wasn't there. Did she go home? Your aunt stopped by, but she wasn't there and she isn't in the practice room. I'm going nuts. Gun-woo, calm down. Why don't you file a police... Hello? Gun-woo? Are you still there? Hello? Gun-woo. Did you find Ru-mi? How is she? Is she okay? Where did you go? I was looking for you. Where the heck were you... I'm sorry. You must have been worried sick. My Gun-woo must have been really scared. My bad, sorry. I thought I was dying. I... I couldn't breathe. Isn't this a bit too much? It's bad as it is those people joined us, but that old man supposedly has dementia. Seriously, and Maestro Kang is too mean. This is ridiculous. How much longer must we put up with it? Let's wait and see. - Let's-- - We need to do-- Thanks for gathering so late at night. Okay, let's have fun. Second movement. What are you doing? Are we the North Korean army? That was emotionless! Can't you read English? Don't you know crescendo and decrescendo? Beethoven was completely deaf when he wrote this motif! Can't you do any better? Concertmaster, did you not check the violin bowing? Did you make a bet who's going to be the first to poke a hole in the ceiling? Let's start that part going up. We started it going down. Okay, I'll go up. What the hell is his problem? Hey, you. What did you just say to the concertmaster? First horn, sit down and talk. No. Aren't they way too disrespectful? I'm going to dismiss you if you keep standing up. Why do you keep looking at the time? Yes, we practiced for ten minutes. Do you want to go home even though you're terrible? How can you sleep? We'll practice until we get it right! - I have a class. - Postpone all your lessons and classes. How can you teach when you're so horrible? After practice, I want the first leads to stay and synchronize. Got it? Why aren't you answering me? Let's start again with the fourth movement presto. Clarinet, how long have you played? Can't you distinguish A clarinet from B flat clarinet? Why are you changing it? Just leave! You're way too harsh! You leave too. I said I'd dismiss you if you stood up one more time. This... - This isn't right! - Jung-jin! Let me be! I need to say what's on my mind! We auditioned fair and square. You have no right to treat us like this! Didn't I tell you every performance and practice will be like an audition? But still, this isn't... Sure. I'll leave. I wanted to resolve this through communication, but I don't think we'll get anywhere. Inexperienced guest musicians and a disrespectful conductor... My patience ran out. Isn't this concert supposed to kickstart the Seokran Philharmonic? I wish you luck with half the official members gone. Hey. Concertmaster. Hey. Hey! Holy cow. "I'm positive the members will start a strike." Third, we would like an apology of your insulting remarks and a promise that it will never happen again. You didn't expect this from us, right? You're in no position to lecture him. Didn't you think the choral symphony can't continue without the choir, so I had to listen to your requests? All you need to do is apologize. What's so difficult about saying you're sorry? I didn't do anything wrong to apologize for! He's going to lead your choir practices from now on. The concert banners are all ruined. You can't even see the date. Maestro Kang has never beaten us. He never once tried to beat us. So I'm planning on apologizing. Satisfied? Don't cry anymore. The concert will work out. It'll be fine. It's so remarkable, that once the music world finds out, that musician's career would be over immediately. Maestro Kang is the one who had faith in me. But he's in a tough spot.
