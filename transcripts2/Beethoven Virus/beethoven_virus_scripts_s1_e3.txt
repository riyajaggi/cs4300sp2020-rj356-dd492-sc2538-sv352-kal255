 - They're all good people. - Jung Myeong-hwan is coming. He's the one who always hindered me from my goals. You can teach us nicely. {\an8}Anyhow, I'll have to conduct those people in front of him. {\an8}Do you think that makes sense? {\an8}Don't you know a carrot works better than a whip? {\an8}I don't know! I'm not even pleased with professionals. But I have to go on stage with those people out there. Does that make sense? Isn't a successful performance a fun one? Listen to me!

 I have to perform with that trash in front of a jerk who became the best conductor on a whim! All because of you! Trash? We have a week. Now that I've made up my mind, there's no slacking off. I'll go all in for a week. I'll throw in the towel if there's no hope. I'll tell the mayor after. Work hard if you don't want to get kicked out. Do you think you're any better than them? I'll just quit. Ms. Jung. I mean, Hui-yeon.

 If you quit now, you'll really be crap. You need to show Maestro Kang what you've got. I'm not sure. You can't improve in a day. I come here after closing the hospital at six. How can you quit? We haven't even started! But he's too intimidating. What kind of conductor is like that? He'll end up beating us. It's rumored that he has a needle and pokes you if you're out of tune. Those are only rumors. Can you endure it for a while longer? I can't face Gun-woo. And I'm scared of my husband finding out. I might be a nuisance, just like Mr. Kang said. I'm scared to death. I came here to relieve stress, but it's stressing me out more. I want to quit. Sorry, Ru-mi. I have to go. - Don't go. - Ma'am. Ma'am... Hui-yeon. Oh, man... Again! How can we perform if not one of you can play properly? Start practicing with Do Re Mi. Practice it a hundred times. I'll skip the strings, the cello, and so on and so forth... You've practiced for so long, but you can't do this short piece? Do you feel better? Are you filled with joy after criticizing everyone? Not really. You can't change even if I criticize you a million times. It's a waste of energy and strength. It's the same for us, too. It's a waste of our time if the conductor doesn't even explain our mistakes. Do you talk to your trumpet while you play it? "Can I press you, first piston? What do you think, third piston?" Do you perform by asking, teaching, and explaining? What do you mean? - Talk in layman's terms. - You're my instrument. I'm performing an instrument called an orchestra, and you're the parts! Old instrument, young instrument, crybaby crap instrument, office worker instrument, cabaret instrument, wise guy instrument! We're human beings. No! You're just dogs! And I'm the master! So, shut up! Bark when I command you! Time's up. Practice is over. We're dogs? Have you ever been bitten by a dog? No. A dog ran toward me once, but I kicked it. It whimpered. Gun-woo, he has a sharp tongue. Just let him be. Why are you out of tune? Can't you play correctly? I got nervous because he kept pressuring me. Everyone feels the same. We're too intimidated to play. This is a huge problem. We won't be able to accomplish anything. Have you heard of Mazinger Z? He has arms and legs of steel. You're no different from him. You have thick legs. You have chubby arms. Is music made using one's strength? Do you use fat to make music? How can you laugh? I want to laugh. You're a dog and I'm the master! Bark when you're told to bark! What are you doing wasting my time? It's because of Maestro Kang. We're so intimidated, we can't even show our capabilities. So you want to have fun and put a comedian on the stand? Is our performance some kind of psychodrama? Do you think psychological therapy solves the issue? We were having fun. Must you ruin the mood? Aren't you the one who couldn't say a word in front of the real Maestro Kang? Hey, I'm old enough to be your uncle. Do you think being rude and talking back make you cute? That's exactly it. Why don't you be Maestro Kang? What did you say? You're hurting my feelings. I'm far more charismatic than that wimpy little fellow. That's right. I wanted to ask you before. Why do you dress like that? You should practice playing the trumpet instead of ironing your clothes. Do you perform with your clothes? It's none of your business whether I perform in pajamas or a bikini! Just let me be me. That's a lame answer, Yong-gi. Think of him as Maestro Kang, and then say something cooler. Let's just practice! We're already practicing our hearts and souls at home. Good. But say something after that. "We're practicing our best at home..." And say anything that comes into mind. We're practicing our hearts and souls at home. We practice day in and day out. If you tell me what I'm doing wrong, it will be of tremendous help. Don't hesitate to tell me what my problem is. Play for me, and I'll tell you. Okay. Can you see why I don't say anything? Yes. Sorry. Me too? You press too hard on your bow because you played the electric violin. The same goes for the rest of you. You need to listen to not only your instrument, but the other instruments as well, in order to create harmony. Am I right, sir? Yes. Let's try it. - Give me the beat. - Sure! Okay. I can't believe you. It's midnight! What are you still doing here? I need to go home, too! You're so inconsiderate. You look like a robot. What's up with this? You'll end up breaking your arm. Should I conduct instead? Even if it's only practice, you need a better form. Claudio Abbado conducts like a bird. Do it like him. And don't look so serious. Let's see... Jeez, it's all in English. BASICS OF CONDUCTING Why are you snooping around my bookcase? I can't fall asleep. I hid these here before. Don't you have insomnia? I'll leave them with you. I don't need them. Take them. I'll leave them. Oh, it's cold. ECSTASY TILL DAWN {\an8}BASICS OF CONDUCTING {\an8}Vienna Philharmonic. Correct. Next is... Mendelssohn. Correct. Dvorak. Correct. Yes? This is I-deun. I'm here to discuss something with you. Can you open the door for me? I wanted to talk to you from before. I can't trust anyone, but I wanted to discuss something with you because you were nice to me. My family is struggling financially. We have nowhere to live, so we live in a shed at a nursing home. My mom used to work at a restaurant, but she's suffering from diabetes. My dad works at a construction site, but he has a limp. I have no tears to shed because I have so many heartaches. So what is it? Well, I wanted to discuss with you whether or not I should drop out of school. And you don't need money? Thanks. That would be so great. I'm so happy that you're the one who brought it up. If you would lend me 200,000 won-- I never said I'll give it to you. I only wanted to see if money was what you were really after. But I get really scared sometimes. You're nervous, but so am I. I know how you feel. You're trying to beat it. I try not to think about it, but I worry when you're late for practice. I wonder if I should tell people so we can help you-- - Tell them. - Pardon? Didn't you say it was a secret? Tell them. Tell them the former Seoul Philharmonic Orchestra oboist has dementia. That's way better than being threatened by a low-life punk! Why are you yelling at me? I'm not senile yet! How dare you threaten me when I'm not sick yet? You already took 20,000 won from me, you ignorant wench! "Wench"? Gosh, you're annoying the hell out of me! Who brought up money first? It was you! Besides, did I ask for millions of won? All I'm asking for is 200,000 won. And I'm not asking for a handout, just a loan. - Is that so-- - Get out, you bitch! Get out! How dare you be disrespectful to an adult? You really must be senile. Are you in denial? Oh, no. Should I call the doctor for you? Why, you... This is the tempo Maestro Kang designated for us. We can't change it. The conductor determines the tempo, but this is only practice. Do whatever you want. Let's speed it up a bit. Your breathing is much better, and you're in tune. But why are you so fast? Are you playing a waltz? Look at me and slow down. Again. Stop! What's wrong with you? Why aren't you looking at me? So you want us to keep this beat, right? Can't you tell? You have to look at my hands. Why are you clapping? Yong-gi wasn't too sure. Is it this fast? That's it, right? Much slower than that. Like that. I see! It's this fast, Yong-gi. Got that? I got it. Okay, let's do it again. Once the mood finally gets better, he ruins it. Once we get it right, he says it's wrong. He's no conductor. He's our enemy. Still, he said we've improved. Good work. It's all thanks to you. Well, you're the one who gave me guidance. Be careful. It will be a problem if Maestro Kang finds out you're conducting our practices. We have to worry about that? The conducting part, that is. Like earlier. We were so used to Gun-woo's conducting that we couldn't follow Maestro Kang. In the future, we should practice according to Maestro Kang's interpretation. Honestly, he doesn't do much. Why should we care that much-- But still, it's not right. The difference in interpretation and having another conductor on the podium are pride issues. What's a maestro? President, general, maestro. Those are the jobs men aspire to have. It's a very important position. So be sure that Maestro Kang doesn't find out. Sure. Are the concertmaster and oboist having some kind of summit? It has only been three minutes. Let's just start. Let's take it from the top. I-deun, where are you? How dare you quit school? Do you know why I'm working so hard with a crippled leg? - Please, honey... - What? Let's go out and talk, Dad. Please? Let's go out and talk! I heard you're threatening innocent people as well! - Are you a thug? - Who said that? I don't know what you heard, but why are you doing this? Someone called and told me you're up to no good! Why did you quit school? Don't you know I work at construction sites to pay for your music school? - Is it you? - Let's leave. Let's go out and talk! Are you the one who sweet-talked my daughter into dropping out of school and earning money by doing this? It's not what you think, Dad. Let's go out and talk. So why would you do such a thing? She was studying the flute just fine in school. Why did she suddenly quit school to be here? I'm curious as well. What is your daughter doing here? Why are you yelling at me? And why do I have to feel this discomfort? Did I give birth to her? She seems too unsophisticated to be my child, right? She's your daughter, right? Your daughter is a thorn in my side. She goofs off although she isn't even good. She texts like crazy and counts down the end of practice. I wondered what kind of parents raised her, and I see it all now. Like father, like daughter. You must be proud of her because you're exactly alike. Hey, how dare you talk to my dad like that? Apologize now. Did you hear that? She's disrespectful to someone who's twice her age. How did you raise her? Hey! Come here. Did you hear what that bastard said? He insulted you! You bastard. You're just a conductor. How dare you speak to my dad like that? I said come here! Honey. Honey. Honey. Dad, don't you have the guts to say anything? Tell me why you quit school. Why did you barge in when you couldn't even talk back to him? You only humiliated me! I-deun, how can you say that to your dad? Why did I quit school? Don't you know why? You went bankrupt. We live in a shed at a nursing home because we have no money! How can I attend music school? Play the flute? Are you kidding me? Didn't I say you had talent? If you just go to school-- How can I go to school when I can't pay my tuition? Yes, I lied to you. I said it was only 500,000 won because I was sick of you struggling, but it's over a million. Even without private lessons, it's 500,000 for training and 120,000 for food! Did you know I starved the entire time there? Who called you? Let's go back to school and ask them to take you back. I already dropped out. - Did you ask her parents to come here? - No! No, I only called them. We have nowhere to live, so we live in a shed at a nursing home. My mom used to work at a restaurant, but she's suffering from diabetes. My dad works at a construction site, but he has a limp leg. I-deun, you need to graduate from high school. Let's go to school before your teachers go home. Let's go and beg, or go and borrow money to bribe them. - I'm not going! - Let's go! I don't want to! - Unbelievable. - Honey. Honey... I'm going to quit. No, I'm not quitting. Maestro Kang, that douchebag, kicked me out. So give me the 180,000 won you promised. Sorry, I can't give it to you. Gosh. Are you screwing me over as a team now? You're the ones who breached the contract, so I should get the money. The contract states that you need to work hard during rehearsals. But all you did was text on your phone. And you skipped the extra rehearsals. You were always late, but also the first one to leave. When you do show up for practice, you either not have your music sheets or complain that your flute was banged up. Would you pay up if you were me? Fine, I don't want that stupid money. Instead, let me ask you a question. Who called my parents and ratted me out? Was it you? Yes, it was me. I called them! Was it you, Old Man? I said it was me! Who are you trying to blame? I can't believe you tattled on me. Are you ashamed? Why did you do something so shameful? I called them because I was worried. You're like a granddaughter to me. You disrespect people and curse them. But moreover, what will happen to you if you quit school? Your life can't be repaired! You're the one who made it that way. Don't you remember the 200,000 won? That was for my school tuition. I removed posters, typed documents, taught kids how to play the recorder, but I was short 235,000 won. Damn. I was going to ask her for 100,000 won and you for the remainder, but both of you gave me the cold shoulder. Who's the one who kicked me out for being ignorant? It was you, Old Man. You know what? I didn't tell anyone about your secret. She doesn't even know. But look at you. Did you rat on me so your secret will be safe? Is that why you tattled on me? So that I'll get the boot? "Granddaughter"? As if. I can see right through you. You make me want to barf. Old Man, you, and that Maestro Kang jerk. You had better watch your backs. I'll make sure your concert is spectacular. Hey, I-deun! I'll give you the money. I-deun! How are you supposed to play the second measure? - What's the melody for that? - It's like this. Oh, you need to rest for half a beat. You forget that, so you're offbeat. No, I always rest half a beat. You rest a full beat. Everyone has a different sense of beat. - What about this? - Is Gun-woo your private instructor? - I get confused here. - For me, here. I can't believe you two. I asked him first! You need to wait for your turn! Except you, Ju-hui. You can ask him. Move out of the way, Ju-yeon. What are you doing? Nothing. We're discussing our dinner. Gun-woo is responsible for collecting the money. We were complaining that it was too expensive. You don't have to pay, sir. Don't collect money from him! You will absolutely not! There are no exceptions. I'm sorry, sir. Wasn't I supposed to play like that? You play. Sorry? Everyone seems to think you're their god. I want to see how good you are. Play from section C. What are you doing? What's the melody? What? I can't read music. What? You can't read music? Is that for real? Yes, it's too complicated. It's faster just to memorize it. "Memorize"? Yes, after listening to it. But it's not like I got in the way of our performance. Reading music is basic, man. Play it. Cool. If this is a big problem, I'll learn how to read music starting tomorrow. But... All this time, you played from memory? Yes. You're gifted. Sir, he's a genius. It's hard to memorize parts. It's not the same as memorizing scores. He's gifted just because he plays without looking at the music sheet? My daughter can sing the Sgt. Frog theme song without sheet music. Does that make her gifted? - So many people are gifted, then. - It really is remarkable. Can you memorize all your parts, especially when you come in and out? What about the motif? You can memorize the tempo and dynamics after listening to it once? Wow. No wonder he seemed different. It all makes sense now. No wonder a guy like you could teach us what we're doing wrong! - "Teach"? - Oh, no. Gun-woo used his good memory during our extra practices. He would say exactly what you had told us during our regular practices. Good, that's a good talent. But you should still learn how to read music. - Hey, you did well. - Watch it. I'm proud of you. How can I become as good as you? Stop. Why don't you give me private lessons? This is your late-night snack. Since when? Since when did you know you could memorize music? You can memorize everything if you hear it once, including the other parts? Yes. That's why you didn't learn how to read music? Yes. Even at the age of 25, you didn't know your talent and lived as a traffic control police officer. Even though you ended up playing classical music, you don't really care about it. So you're answering my questions emotionlessly, without realizing that gift you have. It's like pearls before swine. It's like the donkey in the lion's skin. You're one or the other! You're either pompous or stupid. You know how to boil water, right? Enjoy. Where are you going? I'm going to get a late-night snack. I see! It's this fast, Yong-gi. Got that? No wonder a guy like you could teach us what we're doing wrong! I could just tell it was off by 1/8, which required this much adjustment. Sir, he's a genius. It's hard to memorize parts. It's not the same as memorizing scores. - Can you do that? - She did it earlier. Oh, Ju-hui! Can you do that? Let's get back to practice. Pay attention to the parts you had trouble with. Mr. Genius, just do it for us once. Our beautiful Ju-hui connected the speakers to hear you play. If you don't do it, she's going to be terribly disappointed. - Then I'll be hurt even more. - Jeez! Am I right, Ju-hui? You have a strand of hair on your shirt. - Hey, I'm going to tell your mom about it. - Go ahead. It's late. Let's stop goofing off and get back to practice. You don't like practicing until late. Let's hurry and finish it up. I'm good. I can't even breathe while practicing with Maestro Kang, but I'm so at ease practicing like this, I can probably play the trumpet with my nose. Everyone's in a good mood. Let's try to play it through without making any mistakes. - Let's begin. - Okay. Don't you think we're faster than Maestro Kang's tempo? Who cares? It's just practice. The title is "Light Cavalry Overture." It needs to feel like a horse is racing. Enough with the feelings. You should say that your emotions just disappear. Emotions or feelings. They're the same thing. Let's go home already. Don't you agree, sir? What's so good about Maestro Kang? Our true conductor is Gun-woo, don't you think? Mr. Bae can't even say a word when Maestro Kang's around, but he's so talkative at practice. I totally prefer the faster tempo. We need to go with the conductor's interpretation for the performance. Who cares if it's fast or slow? Let's go home. It will be a huge problem if Maestro Kang finds out. Let it be. If things go wrong, we can make a President step down. Making a conductor step down is easy. Is he going to shoot a canon or hose us down with a fire extinguisher? All he has is a tiny baton. We have bigger instruments. Oh, my god! Didn't you go out for a late-night snack? Are you eating with everyone? Why do you look surprised? Were you discussing a secret independence movement over dinner? Sir... It's good that you stood up. Come outside. Well... Go back in. I started it. I'll resolve it. How? What should I do? Leave. - Sir. - Kick him out. If you don't, I won't conduct. - Okay, I'll leave. - Gun-woo. You need a conductor for the concert. I'll look for a replacement trumpet player. Wait. Sir, Gun-woo can't leave. What? Gun-woo was the one who persuaded everyone not to quit, and got us to this level by making us practice. He can't leave. I made myself clear. If you don't kick him out, I won't conduct. I won't! That's why... If you make me choose, I'll choose Gun-woo. What's the matter with you? He's learning how to conduct on his own. He can most likely perform on stage. He can't compare to you, but the performance can happen. It seems like you're burned out. We can make it somehow if I said you were replaced because you're sick. "Somehow"? Do you think this is a circus? You always try to weasel your way out. Yes, I'm superficial. I don't care about the quality of the performance as long as we do it. But it won't be mediocre. I won't be at risk if you lead our performance. I can endure your condescending remarks and insults, but... But what? You can't stand it anymore? I can bear with it because I caused all this. I have nothing to say if you were to kick me or spit at me. But I can't stand it when you... mistreat the other orchestra members. You're talented and experienced. That's a good thing. I want someone who has faith in us and is nice to us. That's the conductor we need right now. And that's Gun-woo. Not you. Are you finished? If it's okay with you, I would like to go. I'm a bit tired. I'm sorry, sir. I don't know what to say. Here you go. Thanks. - It looks good. - Thanks. Why couldn't you fry more fish? Isn't it bland? Mine is always so tiny! Yes, this is where I belong, not in an orchestra. My husband and kids couldn't do anything without me. It's best to be where I'm needed the most. Wasn't it tough? I bet it was tough for you because I wasn't at home at times. I'm really sorry, honey. I'm really sorry, kids. But I snapped out of it. Honey, that's why I plan on being better. I made it uncomfortable for you all because I leave the house at night to volunteer at the church, but that won't happen again. - You were away? - Weren't you at home? I've been coming home late recently. I came home past 11 p.m. two days ago. Two days ago? Weren't you sleeping in the master bedroom? Oh, that was me, Dad. I was lying in bed because it's cooler in there. No wonder I thought your mom shrunk. Pick out the fish bones for me. Okay. Didn't I tell you I would come home late because I was volunteering at church? Why would you stay out late at night? So no one really knew I was coming home late at night? Consider yourself lucky that we didn't know. If I knew, I would've had a fit. Volunteering at church? As if. You need to take care of your family first! And what's with the rice? How can you volunteer when you can't even make rice properly? The rice is watery. Let's have mallow soup. Go buy some mallow. Here you go. What else? - I need mallow. - Mallow? - Hi. - Give me some bean sprouts. - Sure. - I was here first. Give me mallow. I don't have any. Take some groundsel instead. They're very fresh today. - Be generous. - Didn't you want bean sprouts? Sure, hang on. Here it is. What else do you need? - Two dozen quail eggs. - You have mallow here. Wait, I'll take care of you after her. You have mallow! Why did you lie that you didn't have any? It's right over there! How could you forget? Isn't mallow green? Why are you overlooking it? I'm not overlooking it. It's just that I didn't see it... How could you not see it? How could a store owner not know what she has? You don't care whether you have mallow or not? How sad would the mallow be? Why are you disrespecting it? Why? - We're really late. - Seriously. We too engrossed in learning how to read music. How was Maestro Kang when you left home earlier today? I didn't see him. I think he must have packed up and left. Did he buy his own plane ticket? Hurry up! Did you see a ghost? Why are you so shocked? Today is the last day I promised to conduct the orchestra. I need to wrap things up. Sit. You don't need your sheet music. Do you have a pencil? Write this down. "Nella Fantasia" was composed by Ennio Morricone in 1986. It was composed in 4/4 time. The original title was "Gabriel's Oboe." It was used in the film The Mission. Although the sheet music doesn't go into detail about the composer, you'll get a sense of how to play this if you listen to the CD. You'll often have to play in legato. In order to play this piece well, you must hit the triplets accurately. You have to maintain the syncopation, too. Even though this is in 4/4, you'll have to play as if it's alla breve so that it sounds like a legato. Also, be sure to pay attention to the coda and segno. GIVE UP In the movie, the priest pays a visit to the scary natives. By playing the oboe, he's able to change the hearts of the natives who were about to kill him. In other words, the audience is like the natives and you're the priest who has to perform. But do you know what your performance sounds like? Wasn't that horrible? If I were the native, I would've killed the person who played like that. So how should you play? Oh, I think I get it. I can completely feel the difference. Of course. If you don't, you're an idiot. I'm not an idiot. Okay, let's become like the priest and play. Close your eyes, everyone. Keeping the tempo and being in tune are not really important. You can achieve that if you practice on your own like crazy. The important thing is what you want to convey to the audience. The emotions. Don't open your eyes. You hear the sound of birds somewhere. You hear the trickling of the brook. You feel the warm rays of sunlight through the trees. You hear the squirrel's footsteps. The wind blows back and forth. In the midst of the wind, you smell the leaves and grass. Can you feel it? This is a world that hasn't been tainted by man. Welcome to "Nella Fantasia." Relax, everyone. No need to worry about the notes and the tempo. Just feel it. But you can't play on your own, so I'll give guidance from time to time. Just follow my lead. Play as if it's coming from afar. Connect the melodies a little bit more. Louder! Fantastic and dreamy! Play slowly, as if you're nearer. Start fading away. Slowly. Great job. Just by his conducting... Look at how we've changed. Nice! Maestro Kang, you're the best! It's touching! So touching! This is it for me. I hope you do well on your own, though I don't know how well you'll do. You know Kang Gun-woo, the upcoming star who sits in the back, right? He's the lazy genius who memorizes everything because he's too lazy to study. From now on, he'll be conducting you. Coincidentally, he has the same name as mine. But I wonder if his conducting abilities are the same as me. I'll leave that up for you to resolve. What are you talking about? I'm leaving tomorrow, so buy me a plane ticket. For first class. Where is he going? He's leaving? Where is he going? Is he quitting? Sir! Where are you going? Don't go! How can you leave us? You can't leave, sir! I'll buy you everything you want, sir! What's going on? Are you planning to help me? Don't worry. I already packed everything. Send me my other stuff to that address. One of my conducting books is missing. Did you take it? My gift. Memorize it inside and out, so you can conduct one day. I don't know if memorizing will help. But I bet it will because you're special. I have to go to bed. I'm tired because I had to put on a show for people who were substandard. I hate you. That's a pretty harsh goodbye. You didn't have to come all the way here to tell me that. Don't we know that already? You're hurting people by being sarcastic, by boasting about yourself beyond what people can handle, and by cruelly putting down someone who talks back at you. It all bugs me. I hate your character completely. Yes, there are people like me, and there are people who are like this, untalented people who leech onto other people and suck out all their blood. You'll miss me after dealing with those people. I'll take that as a compliment. But you're amazingly talented. I acknowledge that. I'm embarrassed to say this, but... this was the first time in my life I felt that music was beautiful. I don't know if you'll believe me, but it's true. You're scaring me. Weren't you the one who danced around my podium and changed the tempo? You're scaring me. Please conduct for us. And please teach me. I want to learn how to conduct. I doubt you want me to say yes. What is this? Did you expect a twist in our conversation? Amusement? Wit? But what do you know? That was too cliché to be amusing or witty. I was pompous. Seeing you conduct... I realized I was out of line. Oh, I see. You were pompous. Thanks for clearing that up for me. I'm also stupid. I realize how lacking I am. In what way? Tell me in what way you are lacking. If I'm convinced, I'll reconsider giving up my post. I'm lacking in so many ways. I lack in every single way. Fine, I know how you feel. But I can't conduct. An apology is separate from punishment. Don't you think that you, the orchestra members, and the concertmaster need to pay? Did you know Mozart was a commoner, you jerk? According to your theory, Mozart should've milked cows and sold cheese all his life! If you were a conductor back then, you would've destroyed many great talents! You're like Salieri! I want someone who has faith in us and is nice to us. That's the conductor we need right now. And that's Gun-woo. Not you. Why isn't she calling to apologize? FEISTY CHICKEN - This is the concertmaster. - I know. - Did you buy my plane ticket? - Yes. - Bye, Mr. Kang. - I had a great time. Thank you. Goodbye. I'm tipsy. I drank every drink they offered. That wasn't smart. - Let's go home. - I'll open the door for you. - No, I can open it. - Okay. It doesn't matter who opens it. Jeez, I'm dying! Close it! I'm dying. Let's hurry home. Let's go. - Sorry. She jumped in front of the car. - Who is that? What are you doing? What the heck are you doing? What are you doing? Let go! I waited a long time for you, Mayor Kang. Are you drunk? Would it be okay to hear out something important? What is it? I bet you'll sober up once I tell you my story. It's juicy. I booked it for tomorrow afternoon. It's the earliest flight available. That's it? You don't have anything to say? I want you to stay, but I'm too ashamed to ask you. Go on. Babble anyway. I'll hear you out. I know you won't stay even if I ask you to. And, even if you stay, I can't guarantee that this won't ever happen again. I know you put us into our places by showing how beautifully you can conduct. But that was only once. It will be difficult for you to continue like that because it's not your style. The members' abilities can't suddenly change. It will be tough for you even if you were forced to say. Get to the point! Aren't you saying he's the best conductor in your eyes? I'm the one who got Gun-woo and the other orchestra members involved. At first, the concert was important, but now, they're more precious. But... I do apologize for underestimating and questioning your abilities. And having Gun-woo conduct us without your permission. You push all my buttons and then apologize. You have a lousy excuse. I learned a lot from you. Thank you for everything. Hello? - Who's this? - Is the orchestra fake? Pardon? What did you say, Mr. Kim? Is the orchestra fake? Did you blow 300 million won, Ru-mi? The mayor is furious right now! Come here right now! Hello, Mr. Jung Myeong-hwan. You're saying Jung Myeong-hwan can make an outstanding brew using this. Look forward to the concert. My age... No one accepted me... My mom fell in love with dancing. Be selfish! You're way too nice. Run back to the practice room! Your arm... Are you hurt? If you do as I say, you'll learn a minute aspect of conducting. "You're the bomb, Maestro Kang. I love you." What's with the way they talk? Get out! I told you to sit! She's my employee! She's my concertmaster! She's my concertmaster and they are my orchestra members! I'm the only one who can disrespect them! They're mine!
