 {\an8}YEAR 1998 You have ten minutes left. I can't do it. Sir, please! If you would conduct just this once-- I can't do it. The audience is all here. It's ten minutes, no, nine minutes before curtain! Tell them to go home because we're ill-prepared. No, even if they practice, they still can't be called an orchestra. I can't do it.

 Just do it! You're ruined if you don't conduct! Your career is over! Do you know whose piece is being performed today? It's Brahms'. If I were to die and go to heaven, I would see him. I won't be able to lift my head out of shame. Heaven? Bastard. You will end up in hell. Most likely a fiery hell, you son of a bitch! {\an8}WORLD FAMOUS CONDUCTOR MAESTRO KANG {\an8}YEAR 2008 Gun-woo, I'm here. Hello. - Did you have a son or a daughter? - A son who looks just like me. Where did Sang-tae go?

 He's on traffic control duty because the signal light is out of order. I couldn't wash up because I've been working for three days straight. Thanks, man. - I'll see you later. - Get some sleep. Bye. {\an8}Officer Kang Gun-woo? Calling officer Kang Gun-woo. {\an8}Yes, this is Officer Kang Gun-woo. {\an8}Go check on an accident in Danja. Yes, sir. Sorry, there's huge traffic backup and you're the only one who's available. Stop by before heading home. Over and out. Yes, sir. Keep up the good work. Why the hell would I move my car? So you do know you're at fault. Don't you know - that you rear-ended me, you jerk? - Hey! Move your cars already! You hit me while backing up, man. When did I ram into you? Knock it off. Are you going through insurance? - Will you go through insurance? - Oh, god, honey! You were the one who hit me. Why would I go through my insurance? I can't believe such nonsense, you bastard! Why you little... - Don't fight. - Hey! Move your car! Would you move if it were you? Go around! Go around where? My wife is in labor right now! Move your cars! - You'll have to move your cars. - What? I might end up paying for something that wasn't even my fault! Why in the world would I move my car? - So you do know you're at fault. - Get in. - What? - Give me your contact details! - Hell no! - Fight at the police station. - I need you to move your cars now. - It hurts! I can't! I won't! - What a jerk. - What? I won't either. Hey! Move your cars now! Let's get to the bottom of this even if it takes all night. You idiot. You're going to do what, you butthead? I'm telling you, you have nothing left to say. I won't move my car! KP-PLUS 3 PACKING AND MOVING You listen to me... Shut up! Fine, let's bicker all night long. I won't move my car. Must I use violence? Why you little... You fool! I said move your cars! This is your last warning. Move your cars! - That psycho. - He's crazy. Do you know what you just did? What will you do about my car? I'm Traffic Police Officer Kang Gun-woo. I'm sorry. Contact me. Go. Hurry up. Thank you. Thank you! {\an8}FUTURE CONDUCTOR KANG GUN-WOO Here's to Seokran City's Culture and Art Department! - Cheers! - Cheers! - Drink. - Nice. Cheers. - Help yourselves. - Yes, sir. - Help yourselves. - I have to run. You're so dedicated. You're busy at work, yet you play in the orchestra. It's only a hobby. - Goodbye! - Play something for us before you leave. Did you really major in music, Du Ru-mi? Actually, I've never heard you perform. - Play something for us. Just one song. - Oh, come on! - One song! - One song! - One song! - One song! - One song! - Applause! I don't mind playing the violin for you, but... Yes? Did you do anything to help me out? Shit. That's right, I went to a music college to study the violin. Every orchestra I got into ended up getting disbanded! Recently, one took off without paying me! So I unwillingly became a civil servant. I, who only played classical music for ten years, now have to find typos, make copies, and check for office supplies! That pisses me off. On top of that, you want me to play for you while you're drinking? Why should I? Am I crazy? You're all unbelievable. - One song! - One song! - I'll get fired if I do that, right? - One song! - One song! - One song! Hurry up! Applause! - Du Ru-mi! - Du Ru-mi! There's nothing to life. Who cares about classical music or my dream? I'll die eventually anyway. C'est la vie. {\an8}CONCERTMASTER 63 DAYS LATER DU RU-MI {\an8}-Du Ru-mi! - Du Ru-mi! - Sir, here are the documents you wanted. - Thanks. - Du Ru-mi. - Yes? Didn't you say she graduated from your school? She must be good. I don't know why, but I'm into classical music these days. Do you think you can get me a ticket? She's terrible. Really? Didn't she graduate from Tchaikovsky Music Institute? There are so many schools in Moscow named after Tchaikovsky. She probably paid money to hold her own recital! The audience is made up of her relatives and friends! - She's just flaunting her money. - Hey! Submit your ideas for the Seokran City Cultural Center! The deadline's in 30 minutes! That's odd. She graduated from Tchaikovsky Music Institute. Hurry, submit your ideas. Thank you. Please hurry. Thank you. She's good. What a douchebag. Did everyone submit their ideas for the Cultural Center? I'm going to end the deadline early. Wait! I didn't submit mine yet. Give me ten minutes. CITY OF MUSIC - SEOKRAN TURN SEOKRAN INTO A CITY OF MUSIC WITH A PROJECT ORCHESTRA CONCERT - Are you confident about this? - Absolutely. Don't you trust me? - Do you know how much it'll cost us? - Don't worry about a thing. - Let's go take a look. - Sure. - Please clean that up. - Okay. Please work hard. This. This is all tax money. You need to work hard. - Du Ru-mi. - Yes? Are you sure we can use this church? Of course. I talked to the priest. He gave us permission. How cool... Practice. Ru-mi, delivery! I never imagined - that it would completely change my life. - Okay. Why are you so late? How did you get all those talented people? I couldn't go in because I was so intimidated. Can I really perform with those people? Even if I keep my job a secret, my talent can't compare to theirs. What's wrong with you? Do you have money? - What? - You don't? I doubt you do. What the... Ru-mi, you said the conductor will come later, right? Should we practice among ourselves first? Ku Jeong-ae, a famous classical music producer, was arrested at her gallery earlier today. She's charged with embezzling over five billion won from concert performances. SCENE OF THE ARREST 5 A.M. AT GALLERY SU I'm sorry for causing such public disgrace. Ku said she graduated from Juilliard, but she's only a high school graduate. The police will... Ru-mi, don't tell me... The mayor doesn't know yet. The prosecutors won't disclose the embezzlement until the investigation is over. I've played the violin since elementary school. My older sister played the cello, so I wanted to play out of jealousy... I was in awe when I first heard Beethoven's "Romance." I liked it so much, I listened to the cassette tape till it was worn out. That's why I included that in our performance. You know how hard it is to make a living after graduating from a music school. Even if you play in a good orchestra, your pay isn't that great. You can't even play for a good orchestra if you didn't study abroad. That's why I've never performed before. I'm working as a civil servant right now, and it's killing me. I'm happy whenever I hear Beethoven's "Romance." I'm reminded that there's more to life than just eating and taking a dump. I had music. I become so happy. I won't be able to give you money for the performance. But can you please help me out just this once? Ru-mi, I'm sorry. I'll contact everyone and tell them to not tell people you were scammed. By the time I realized something was wrong, it was already too late. There's only one way out. I'll kill myself. I'll kill myself and leave this place. Some say... every cloud has a silver lining. But what I need... is money. A way to get money. It was 300 million won. I blew a whopping 300 million won. I really didn't want to do this... but I have no hope. MAYOR KANG CHUN-BAE Hello, Mayor Kang. Yes, rehearsal starts at ten o'clock. Yes, of course. Everything has been prepared. Gosh, I should meet everyone during the first rehearsal, but I have to attend an important meeting this morning. - My gosh. - No, you don't have to come. I contacted all the performers. We'll have a good rehearsal. There's absolutely no need for you to come. I know how hard you're working. Some people say I gave a huge task to a rookie civil servant. But you're the one who submitted the idea. Your idea of promoting Seokran City by holding a concert is great. You graduated from a music school. Who cares if you're a rookie? The important thing is that it's a 300-million-won project. - Yes. - Most definitely. An orchestra concert for 300 million won. Absolutely. Seokran, the city of music, right? You'll be the first one to open with that statement. Our city's reputation is on the line. There's no room for mistakes. Understand? Yes, I know that very well. - Really? - Yes. Bye. Silver lining? I'll have to find one. PROJECT ORCHESTRA MEMBERS WANTED I'm removing everything. Lady, you're not being clear. How much are you paying me? Are you kidding me? That's so little! Forget it. Bye! What kind of glue did they use? It won't come off! A free orchestra? Give me a break. These people try to make money for free. They're crooks. Look here. What kind of milk is this? Sorry? Is it strawberry milk? It can't be... It is strawberry milk. It's red. No, I had regular milk yesterday and the day before yesterday... I've had regular milk for the past five years. No, this can't be. My regular milk has to be somewhere. What the... Let's see. I drank it after breakfast yesterday. It didn't taste sweet. A smell? There wasn't any. There wasn't any... Do you get it delivered? They could've made a mistake. No, the delivery lady is very diligent. The problem is with me. You can make a mistake even if you're diligent. Be quiet! I'm thinking! Why are you yelling at me? Did I ask you? You're the one who asked me... Look, this is red. It's red. What's going on? - Give me cold water. - Sure. Oh, my, I spilled some. Mom, my socks. It's in the fridge... I mean, the dresser in my room. I can't find the new ones. - What about dinner? - Coming right up. Check the washer. I'm late for my prep class. Help me look for it. I need to make dinner. - I'm home. - Hi, Jin-su. Honey, dinner! - Okay. - Find my socks! - I'm hungry. Mom, feed me. - Okay. Aren't you going to feed me? I'm going to be late! I'm looking for it! I found it! Mom, I'm off! I'll be home past 11 p.m.! Okay, sure. PROJECT ORCHESTRA MEMBERS WANTED Can you help me gather people? Do you know anyone who can play the trumpet or horn? Goodness. Man, I'm going crazy. Should I go ask a school band? Jeez! Who's playing the trumpet in the middle of the night? Can you help me out? What? Trumpet? It sounds awesome. Ma'am, did someone new move in? Move in? No, not that I know of. - This sound? - Yes. It's not from here. It's from the new community. - New community? - Yes. Thank you! Ru-mi. Ru-mi! Yes? Hello. I'm here about the trumpet. Sorry, I won't play late at night. Ru-mi! Ru-mi! My name is Du Ru-mi, and I play the violin in a private orchestra. We hold a charity performance annually regardless of the difficulties we face. However, our trumpet player quit, and because of the lack of funds, we'll be having our last performance. My nephew Gun-woo lives here. The person who was playing the trumpet? Is he a musician? He's a police officer. A police officer? How can he live in such a huge house? It's only temporary. The owner of this house suddenly had to go to San Francisco and asked me if I knew anyone. Gun-woo was just assigned to this post, so he mows the lawn and stuff, and lives here for free. He must have lots of free time if he could even mow the lawn. But his current situation is a bit... - He got suspended from police duty. - Suspended? - He must have a lot of time on his hands. - He's not on vacation. He's suspended. Exactly. He can reflect by doing nothing but the performance. I asked him already, but he doesn't want to. He feels like he'll be showing off by performing on stage. - But if I were to ask him- - I doubt it. He's pretty stubborn. He rarely changes his mind. But you never know if you plead with him. He's a softy. He can't ignore a person in need. So if... Because I lost my hearing, this will most likely be my very last performance. For those of you who love classical music, please donate money for a good cause. P.S. We're in dire need of a trumpet player. Please help us. Thank you. Thank you. - Is that an instrument? - Yes. You said yes, right? I can read lips. Is it a trumpet by any chance? I see... He's a softy? As if. He even lied to me. He's no softy. He's leaving? He's just leaving? How can a police officer just leave a citizen in need? How can he be so cruel? Man, he disappeared in a flash. Hey, you jerk! Is once okay? Pardon? Do you really play the trumpet? Yes, I'm not good, but if you're okay with it... I'm sorry, but I can't hear. If you don't mind, can you enunciate your words? I learned on my own! I'm not that good! I see... Can I hear you play? Didn't you say you can't hear? I can feel it if I hold the end of the trumpet. Please. Oh, yes. Nice. Bingo! You're good. Can we make an... Can we make an appointment? Your cell phone's ringing. You didn't put it on vibrate? You're right. I only read text messages. MAYOR KANG CHUN-BAE Yes, Mayor Kang! Why did you call me in person? Yes, of course. Everything is going as planned. Hey. I forgot this is a customized cell phone. I got it yesterday. - If I hold it like this, I can hear-- - Hey! Get lost. Excuse me? Do you want to go to the big house? He's tougher than I thought. What should I do... Yes, sir. He wants to see the orchestra practice. Sorry? The mayor wants to watch it in person? He has high hopes. Is the week after next okay? Week after next? PROJECT ORCHESTRA MEMBERS WANTED Talk to you later! QUALIFICATION: MUSIC SCHOOL GRADUATE QUALIFICATION: AT LEAST 10 YEARS EXPERIENCE QUALIFICATION: AT LEAST 8 YEARS EXPERIENCE QUALIFICATION: AT LEAST 5 YEARS EXPERIENCE QUALIFICATION: AT LEAST 2 YEARS EXPERIENCE QUALIFICATION: AT LEAST 1 YEAR EXPERIENCE QUALIFICATION: ANYONE - Can we really go? - Yes, come. You can practice and stuff as usual. But there's no pay. Who cares? We get to perform at a huge concert. Can amateurs like us really play? Yes, please come. But it's a huge concert held by the city. It's okay! It's totally okay! Can you hold an instrument? Then you can make sounds, right? It's okay, so please come! Just do it! Art doesn't discriminate. Please come. Ta-da! I'm here to put this on for you. Your trumpet case had a hole in it. This should hide it. That's right, I'm the psycho who illegally solicited. I should get locked up! But can you perform just once before you lock me up? Can you play the trumpet... Please? I know you've been suspended! You need to reflect for two months. How can a person reflect all day long? I heard what happened. You didn't do anything wrong! If you were to perform, I'll put you at the very back, so people can't see... You could've majored in the trumpet with that kind of talent. Why are you refusing to play? You always play at home. I didn't graduate from college. So you really taught yourself? And you're that good? Are you gifted? So you couldn't go to college even though you wanted to? Why don't you take this opportunity to make friends and learn classical music... I don't like classical music. - But you played... - That's a patriotic piece. It's "Radetzky March." Johann Strauss Sr. composed "Radetzky March Opus 228." Oh, you didn't know? No wonder. Who cares? We can learn together. No. Why not? It's boring. It's snobbish and annoying. Why? If you're good at playing the trumpet, you must have played classical pieces. Why don't you like it? I hate classical music and I hate people who play classical music. So why? And you're the most annoying among them. Wait a minute! What? Can you please help me? I don't have a trumpeter, oboist, flutist, - cellist-- - You need to help me. - Please. - I'm really busy right now. I'll get everyone, so can you please play the contrabass? - Ru-mi, I'm really busy right now. - Begone! - Hey, I have to go. - Step down! - Step down! - Step down! Evil corporations, begone! - Begone! - Begone! Guarantee minimum wage! - Guarantee! - Guarantee! Evil corporations, begone! - Begone! - Begone! Evil corporations, begone! - Begone! - Begone! Step down, Kwon Tae-min! - Step down! - Step down! Evil corporations, begone! - Begone! - Begone! They'll barge in any minute, so keep your guard up. - Yes, sir. - Not one person can get in. Got it? - Yes, sir. - Hey, Hyeok-kwon. You're young. Why are you in the back? Come over here. Come here and guard the front door. - Okay, stop them. - Sure. Okay, everyone! - Raise our pay! - Raise our pay! - Step down, Kwon Tae-min! - Step down! No. Hyeok-kwon, isn't that your wife? It's okay. Don't cry. I went to your office. They said you'd be here. I didn't know it was this bad. Bo-ra, stop it. Stop it! Knock it off! I told you to stop it! No crying! I'm thinking about playing in the orchestra again. Ru-mi cried and begged. She knows people will follow if she gets me to join since I know a lot of people. Didn't she just want you to play the contrabass? Were you listening to me or what? Who managed Hanyang University's orchestra? Me. I was in charge! Who created the music association? I did! Yes, you were its president, too. Exactly. I wanted to retire, but I guess I should help out a fellow alumnus, right? Of course, you should. Ru-mi is young. She can't do it on her own. You need to lead her. You're right. There aren't many people who play the contrabass. And even if there are, they're not good. Bo-ra, hang on. See? It's Ru-mi again. - Hello? - You bastard! You call yourself a friend? You're not even human! - She's bawling again. - It would be nice if you'd do it. Don't worry about the others. I'll gather up everyone. - Just tell me when the audition is. - What? What did you just say? - You'll do it? - Don't cry. It's not a problem. You don't need to thank me. - Don't cry. - The audition is this Saturday at 1 p.m. - Will you really do it? - You can count on me. I'll get everyone, so be sure to buy us some drinks and snacks. Bye. The concert is in two months, right? I haven't seen you play in a long time. Let me see... What will you wear? Don't worry, I have my college uniform. You already got a facial massage. Contrabass. What? You're so smart. What is Dad going to play? - Contrabass. - Contrabass. - Contrabass. - Contrabass. - Contrabass. - Contrabass. - Contrabass. - Contrabass. SEOKRAN CITY OF MUSIC ORCHESTRA AUDITION The door's not locked, right? We checked earlier. Gosh! Do I have to abduct people? I can't believe no one showed up. I put up so many posters. You're hard at work. Did you eat? Well, not really. - Do you still need a cellist? - Sorry? Oh, my! So, I'm here because of the poster. So, this is the right place for the auditions, right? - Yes. - Yes. I majored in cello. If the time permits, I'll do my best-- You should've told me sooner, ma'am. - Do you know her? - She's my landlady. Hello, ma'am. I'm Park Hyeok-kwon, Ru-mi's senior. I'm Jung Hui-yeon. You don't have to call me "ma'am." Please, just call me Hui-yeon. Oh, I'm sorry, Hui-yeon. You graduated quite a long time ago. Have you been practicing? Yes, I have. Can you play something for us? Well, I sold my cello when I got married. Can you rent me one? No, we can't. You graduated from Hanyang University? Us too. What year did you graduate? Did I put down Hanyang University? I used to go to Hanyang University, but I transferred to Joong-ang University. Just do it. Can you play for us? Which movement of Haydn's "Trumpet Concerto" will you be playing? My music sheets aren't that thick. I'm referring to the movement, not music sheets. There are three movements. Of course, there are three movements. Who doesn't know that? Are you putting me down? No, it's not that. Can you just play for us? The solo trumpet in the third movement, correct? No, I'll play the first movement. I only like to do things that are first. So, the first movement! - That's the third movement. - Precisely. I made a rare mistake because I'm not feeling it. Don't you think it's too bright in here? - It's amazing for your age. - Wow. You were with the Seoul Symphony? Yes, I played the oboe for 30 years and 5 months. I was the first oboist for 18 years and 2 months. After retiring in 2000, I worked out and played the oboe on a regular basis. If you want, I can give you my medical records-- Oh, no. There's no need for that. Please give us your guidance. I'm Kim Gap-yong. I look forward to working with you. I called you yesterday. Is it true I can get paid depending on my talent? Yes, if you're really good. How can you determine what's really good? Really good, not bad, and wonderful all have different meanings. We'll pay you if you're good enough to be a first... Forget it. Excuse me! Hang on! How much do you want? My rate is pretty high. I don't think you can afford to pay me. So how much? We rehearse three hours thrice a week for two months. That's 72 hours. If I add the cost of public transportation, dinner, instrument maintenance, interpretation, and practicing at home... It's about 200,000 won? Then 180,000 won? Deal! - Really? - I can give it to you right now... I mean, after the concert. Show me what you've got. Ju-yeon, you played the violin till you were in junior high. - Yes. - I played till I was in high school. I see. Why did you start playing an electric instrument? It's cool! - Hey! - Ouch. We picked up bad habits by playing only electric instruments. That's why we want to fix our bad habits by playing in an orchestra. Can you play your electric violin for us? Can we go change? - Oh, sure. - Sure. Mother, I have a favor to ask of you. For eight years, I took care of you when you couldn't care for yourself. I would turn you over and massage you so you wouldn't get pressure sores. I'm not asking for a pat on the back. I was too busy to realize it when you were alive, but now that you're gone... I'm so frustrated. You know your son. Mother, don't look at me with such a stern face. This is the money... left over from what you gave us for your funeral. Like you said, I bought the best hemp for your shroud and the most expensive coffin. This is what's left. May I... buy a cello with this money? Please, Mother. Let me, Mother. Please? That's you, right? You gave me permission, right? I'll buy a cello, then. Thank you, Mother. I'll buy it. Hello, my name is Jung Hui-yeon. I look forward to playing with you. Wow, this looks beautiful. - How much did you pay for this? - I won't move. There are plenty of seats. Why do you insist-- That's what I'm saying! The older person should sit elsewhere. I was the first one to arrive. I came here earlier than the church custodian. I opened the doors, turned on the lights, set up the chairs, and got a seat. I prefer sitting in high chairs. Come early if you think it's unfair, or make me come late. How dare you boss me around? - This is my seat. - What? Brass instruments are at the back. You should've told me earlier! Do you want a taste? Try it. Don't you remember me? I'm not sure. Why? Do I look familiar to you? We must have known each other in our past lives. We must have been the wind at the beginning of time. Don't you know Kim Ji-hun's famous poem, Destiny? "You and I were the wind at the beginning of time. You crossed mountains and oceans to see me." You're crazy, right? Did you figure out what happened with the strawberry milk? Do people know you're senile? Did you tell them? - Well, the thing is... - Hello! Nice to meet you! Wow, everyone's here early. You're supposed to be here by eight but... - Ru-mi, are you okay? - I'm sorry. Are you all right? Thank you. I'm okay. We need to kick off with a fanfare. Was that good? Nice to meet you! We haven't gotten everyone yet, but don't worry, we're still looking. Let's begin rehearsing. Did you receive the sheet music? - Yes! - Yes! I'll lead till we get a conductor. I play the violin. I'm Du Ru-mi, the concertmaster. I look forward to playing with you. What movement are you? Third? - Sorry? - Fourth movement? - Did you tune your instruments? - Yes! I'll assume you practiced ahead of time. Let's start with the first piece. Yong-gi, you can't embellish while you're playing in an orchestra. Ladies like it when I play the trumpet like this, and it's cool. Do you think this is a cabaret? Let's take it seriously. What? Cabaret? You keep testing my patience! I guess you do work at a cabaret. Just continue. Just continue? No, stop! Cabaret? Who works at a cabaret? How many notes do you play? My music sheet is filled with notes! - Excuse me! - How dare you? - Excuse me! - Are you a thug? - You... - A thug? Should I beat you up with this? - Stop it. - A thug? - Fine, if you're not. - Want to go to the hospital? - No, I don't. - Do you want to be in the ICU? - I can't believe you. - Why are you pissing me off? - Can you hold this? - Hit me. Do you want me to hit you with a viola? Do you want to feel what it's like to be hit with a viola? Why you little... Why did you pick a fight? He's not being serious. I know he plays at a cabaret. If he leaves, we won't have a trumpeter. We'll find another one! Do we really have to play "Bugler's Holiday" in front of the mayor? You need three trumpeters. Every piece requires a trumpet. We can't have just one trumpeter! Our trumpeter works at a cabaret... When is the mayor coming to watch? Next week. Man, Jeong-Il and Seok-Gyu can't play for us now. Seek and you will find, right? Are you going to do it or what? - How did you get in here? - I asked your aunt. How can the password be 1234? Are you dumb? Get out. If I leave, are you going to join the orchestra? This is trespassing. Do you want me to call the cops? Just shoot me. See if I care! I'm already dead. Why you... - No! - Let go! Hello? Why won't you do it? Why do you hate classical music? Why? Tell me why! If I tell you, will you leave? Well, I may go if it makes sense. Songs like "Wasp," "Soyang River Girl," and "Only You and I Forever" are short and sweet. But classical music is complex and the titles are too long. It's irritating. - That's... - Plus, you wear gowns and suits for performances. - Is it some formal party? - The clothes are-- Why do they use so much English? It's not English. It's Italian. See? You snob. Are you showing off that you're a musician by not speaking in Korean? They're in the process of changing that, but people are used to-- I only met two people who played classical music in my life. One of them is you, and the other one is... Anyhow, I won't play classical music because of that bastard. That bastard? I was interested in classical music, but he totally pissed me off. Who is it? - Go back. - Let's go! - What are you doing? - Just drag him out there. - Why don't we be civil? - Take him to the podium. Do you want me to make a fit on stage? Let go! Let go of me! - Sir. - Wait! Five minutes. Give me five minutes to think. That's impossible. The performance can be completely different in five minutes. Shouldn't you think about the quality of the concert? It's remarkable as is. Please go on stage. I'm here because of a school assignment. I need to ask the conductor a few questions. - I'm really sorry, but he's busy-- - No, it's okay. Come here. - Sir! - It's for his school assignment. I need to help him. What do you want to ask? This is for my music class. Let's say classical music is blank. Fill in the blank for me. I don't think it's blank. No, the blank is what you think of classical music. What do you think it is? I'll give you ten minutes to think about it. Well... Since long ago-- The ten minutes aren't up yet! What do you mean by "long ago"? The Stone Age? Is "uga-uga" classical music? No. The instruments... No, the form of civilization that appeared-- Is the blank long? I guess it's a meter long. Be concise. So what I mean is that Mozart, Haydn-- What about Bach, Handel, and Vivaldi? The people before them weren't musicians? Were they chefs? - He's busy, so... - No, it's okay. I have time. - Sorry, I wasn't prepared. - Then why did you come here? Did you think you'd get a free lecture? I came here to fill in the blank. The blank you're referring to is a word that has many meanings, but you don't seem to even grasp that. See? It's not only the orchestra, but the level of the audience is horrible. Why did you bring a kid like him in here? Sir! We have three minutes left. I need to calm down and think. CLASSICAL MUSIC IS BULLSHIT How can someone... What was his name? The funny thing about his name is... Forget it. It upsets me. No, there really aren't weirdoes like him... No? You're a weirdo. You're selfish just like him. When was I? You got mad and threatened a person who refused to play. You're doing it for yourself, so you don't get fired. If you were swindled of 300 million won, you should pay the price. Why are you pestering me when you were the one who made the mistake? Are you proud of yourself? I would just go to jail if it were me. Sorry. It's not only because I don't want to get fired. Yes, I'm scared of being fired. I can earn money by giving private lessons and get married when I can't. But I can't perform. I played the violin for 17 years, but I hardly ever performed. It's not just me. A majority of the orchestra members are like me. I thought it was a good thing. It may be a group of inadequate musicians, but I wanted to show others that we can do it and that we're good. I don't know if you'll believe me, but that's how I feel. It will be 1.5 million won for three times a week. You only charge 300,000 to 400,000 won for other concerts. If the others are amateurs, then I'll have to cover for them. On top of that, you're practicing thrice a week. That's 1.5 million won. No, you'll just come for the mayor, the dress rehearsal, and the day of the concert. It's 1.5 million won. Didn't you say you were desperate? Okay, I'll wire the money by tomorrow. The other trumpeter I'll bring is more experienced. His rate is two million won. Two million won? That's 3.5 million won. Why? Why isn't he here? Didn't I wire him the money? Ru-mi, relax. How can I relax? Shouldn't he show up if he received the money? It took me forever to save that up. How can he not be here? Mayor Kang is on his way. He'll be here in an hour. Why isn't the trumpeter here? Aren't you short? Should I go? No... That way... Hello. Gun-woo. He's here. - We've got more than enough trumpeters. - There are four of them. Hi. Sorry, I'm late. The trumpeter that I was going to bring can't make it. Is it okay if I'm the only one here? Are you okay with being third? Gun-woo will be third, Yong-gi will be second, and Mr. Kwon will be first. You can send someone home. I can totally cover for two parts. Wait a minute. Hello? I'm at practice. Someone wanted my help. - Just follow my lead. - They're just amateurs. The mayor will be here in 40 minutes. Let's hurry up and practice. If you're not confident, you can pretend to play, okay? - Mr. Kwon, we're about to start. - Go ahead. I'll follow your lead. No, don't hang up. Go ahead. - Mr. Kwon, join in as soon as we start. - What was that? Gun-woo, you got the gist of it, right? Yes. Okay, let's begin with "Bugler's Holiday." Yes. Really? - First... - Count on me. - First... - Is that right? Oh, no. That son of a bitch. Wow, that's a free ride, man. Mr. Kwon, can you take the call later? I can catch up. I'm not like you guys, so just play! Why, I ought to... It's the first trumpeter. Oh, it's Gun-woo. I'll call you back. Okay, bye. Okay, I'm done. Let's start again. Concertmaster, let's start again! What the heck are you doing? Should I go? I'm leaving! Fine, good for you. Really good. Good luck. Good luck, everyone! My goodness! You were going to put it on anyway. Wow, you're fantastic! You performed so well in such a short period of time. All of you are truly professional. It's wonderful. Thank you. We'll be even better with a conductor on the day of the concert. Oh, no wonder I thought something was missing. The conductor isn't here. Why isn't he here yet? Oh, he's arriving today. He usually performs in Europe. Oh, Europe! Excellent! Europe. I told him a month ago and gave him his fee, but due to his busy schedule, he's just arriving now. He'll arrive this afternoon. I'll be picking him up. Oh, I see. That's super. Who is he? Mr. Jung Myeong-hwan? He's booked for the next two years, so I asked someone else. What's his name? Mr. Kang Gun-woo. Most people have not heard of him because he conducts mainly abroad. But he's renowned among musicians. Kang Gun-woo? - Maestro Kang? - Yes. You know of him. - Do you really know him? - No... Yes, I know him. He's an amazing person. Maestro Kang. We called him Maestro Kang. He was very talented. But do you know what his nickname was? It was "orchestra killer." He only wanted the creme de la creme of orchestra members. He'll break up the orchestra if they don't meet his standards. Not one orchestra endured his tantrums. The orchestra Maestro Kang led was one of the top five orchestras in Korea. But he wasn't satisfied with them. I thought he would cancel the concert again, but the President and First Lady were in attendance. He had no choice but to stand on the podium. But... Ladies and gentlemen. Mr. President and Madam First Lady. Aren't you bored? Of course, you are. Because the piece you just heard was trash. I can't endure how lousy they are. You bought expensive tickets to watch this concert. Right. Get a refund from the promoters and buy a Brahms CD. I can't tarnish Brahms' reputation with this kind of performance. Be sure to take a shower when you go home. And especially wash out your ears. That lunatic. So what happened? It caused a sensation. The promoters paid reporters to keep the debacle from the papers. Maestro Kang was pretty much finished after that. But he might think he left on his own. And you're saying that a person like him will be conducting our orchestra, right? His first time in Korea after ten years. Because you invited him. Ru-mi. Classical music is blank. He's the jerk. They say even the rivers and mountains change after ten years. But nothing has changed here. What do you think classical music is? I think it's bullshit. What? You need a chance to perform too. Let's perform. Pay attention. Jung Myeong-hwan's coming. He's the one who always hindered me from my goals. Aren't you happy to meet again as conductor and audience? I suck at the flute. No, you can do it. Let's make a miracle. I'll be your Anne Sullivan! Me? Which cabaret do you work for? Don't Tell Papa. Do you know what they call people like you? C-R-A-P. Why, that son of a... Isn't a successful performance a fun one? Listen to me! I have to perform with that trash in front of a jerk. All because of you! Subtitle translation by Jeong Lee
