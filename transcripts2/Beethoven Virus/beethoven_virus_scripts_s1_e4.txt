 Gosh. I didn't know why they kept making me drink yesterday, but I get it now. {\an8}Are you all right? {\an8}You had more drinks than usual last night. {\an8}Do you think I'm like this because of the alcohol? {\an8}Our City of Music project... {\an8}Are you okay? What's that? Is that music? What kind of music is that boring? - Turn it off at once! - All right.

 I knew this would happen. I will never drink again. You reek of alcohol. Are you already celebrating Seokran's Orchestra concert? How much do you know? The concertmaster planned the concert, but was scammed out of 300 million won. That's why she gathered anyone who ever played an instrument. She forced me to lead those people. That's all I know. Why didn't you tell us sooner? She threatened to kill my dog. In addition, she wanted to replace me with a mere trumpeter. She may be trying to save face, but she says he is the best conductor. On top of that, her biggest goal is to put on an enjoyable concert. She's such an amusing girl.

 Ru-mi, I guess you've been doing many things behind my back. I'm truly sorry, sir. I apologize on her behalf. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. It's all over now. Are you quitting? I'm leaving today. Don't just stand there. Escort him! Do you have a parking slip? Let me validate it for you. Sure. You should save whatever you can. You'll probably get fired. You'll blow your savings in no time. Hello? Hello, Mr. Jung Myeong-hwan. Yes, Mayor Kang has been waiting for you all morning. Let me transfer your call. Mayor Kang, it's Mr. Jung Myeong-hwan. Gosh, Mr. Jung Myeong-hwan! It's an honor for me to receive your call. Yes, your schedule's free? What a relief. {\an8}Moreover, I'm utterly grateful you're coming in person. Okay, I'll see you then. I'll clear my schedule for the day and wait for you. Yes, I'll see you soon. Bye. Sir, let's go. Okay. What... Did you leave something behind? Did you just talk to the conductor, Jung Myeong-hwan? Yes. Mr. Kim recommended him as soon as you said you'd quit. I'll find someone else for you. Whoever it is, he'll be better than Jung Myeong-hwan. But Mr. Jung Myeong-hwan is the best-- We're deciding on my replacement. I need someone who can accept my interpretation and style. Jung Myeong-hwan isn't the man. By someone with your style, do you mean an orchestra killer? I've been very suspicious after this debacle. I did some research on you last night. - Mr. Kim. Bring it. - Yes. You're one of the top conductors in the world, but you've never stayed with an orchestra for more than six months. You're a perfectionist many professionals want to work with, but they avoid you at the same time. You're very picky with performances. You made a violist clinically depressed, and made an internationally acclaimed bassoonist quit music completely. How can our orchestra be worthy of your stature? Even your replacement. We're sorry. What about Mr. Jung Myeong-hwan? Wouldn't he be the same? You created this whole mess. How dare you chime in? Mr. Jung Myeong-hwan pulled it off before! What's that Italian island called, where they couldn't play an instrument? Wait a second. He performed a marvelous concert with children living on the deserted island of Sicily! How can Sicily, with a population of over five million be a deserted island? It's not? Anyhow, it's only an analogy. I doubt things will get better even if Mr. Jung Myeong-hwan conducts for us. Since you made such an effort so far, I wanted you to get some rest-- This is green tea. Oh, I wasn't feeling well this morning, so I had some. The tea bag's all drained. It has to be tossed. Would you like to have some green tea? You're saying Jung Myeong-hwan can make an outstanding brew using this. That's magic. That's amazing. Luckily, there's some flavor left. It's all right. It can be possible. I'll show you some of my magic. I'll show it to you myself, not my replacement. Look forward to the concert. Excuse me. I've already asked Mr. Jung Myeong-hwan to conduct. Sir! Something went seriously wrong. - Gosh. - He's not supposed to be that. Hey, be sure to clear things up with him! Why doesn't this work? You need to take this elevator for odd floors. - How many days until the concert? - Sorry? Oh, it's in two weeks, so 14 days. Postpone the concert as much as possible and call everyone to meet at once! - Are you really going to-- - Are you still dreaming? Drop the fairy tale gibberish about enjoyable rehearsals. Will it be fun to mess up the concert after goofing off during rehearsals? It'll be a nightmare for the rest of our lives! I'll tell them to come to the practice room. No, meet me at the rooftop of the new church building. I'll give you 20 minutes. Run down! What are you eating by yourself? If they're vitamins, pass them around. This is war. It's for headaches. My head is aching. Why do you even keep your useless head if you get headaches? Get rid of it. - Mr. Kim Gap-yong. - Yes. You played for the Seoul Philharmonic. Why did you retire? - My age-- - How can you just leave at the age of 57? The rules-- Why didn't you play for another orchestra? - My age-- - That's an excuse. Why didn't you play for an orchestra after graduating from college? No one accepted me-- That's an excuse. Why didn't you go to music school? My dad was sick, so I had to work. What does your mom do? What did your siblings do? I'm the only son, and my mom fell in love with dancing. - My dad was bedridden. - He can't work if he's sick? - He can't make ramen if he's in bed? - But he was bedridden. How could-- Why is it your responsibility? Children? Parents? You don't need them! Think only of yourself! Why didn't you go to college? What should I expect from a pompous moron? Be selfish! You're way too nice. You're not nice, you're stupid. You made a sacrifice because of your parents or your children? You're mistaken! Look what happened to you! You can't do what you want, you struggle financially, and you have a complex because you sacrificed yourself for others. You're neither nice nor stupid. You're cowards! You could've done it if you tried, but you made hundreds of excuses and ran away! You have nowhere else to run now. As you can see, you're at the edge of a cliff, a rooftop. If you still think you can't do it, I won't stop you. Go. I'll give you one last chance to run away. But I locked that door. If you want to run away, you'll have to jump off. I'll give you three seconds. One, two, three! No one? Good. It was your choice, so there are no objections, right? - Well... - As of today, the main piece will be Rossini's "William Tell's Overture." It's completely different from the warm and fuzzy feeling "Nella Fantasia." Exercise for an hour morning and night to increase your lung capacity. Join a gym and ask the trainer to set you up an oboe course. Oboe course? - Is there such-- - Get some private trumpet lessons. We don't have time. We can't practice only at night anymore. We have to practice all day long. - Quit your job. - Pardon? Request a leave of absence or use your vacation days. I'm in no position to request a long vacation-- Why are you just standing there? We don't have time! Run back to the practice room! Run! Run faster! I'm sorry about that. I must've assembled it wrong. Contrabass, your tune is unstable. Make sure your bow is straight. This is what I mean by keeping your bow straight. Grab the strings firmer with your left hand. Sure. Check your sound post. It must be crooked. Flute. Your high notes are unstable. Didn't you tune your instrument? I did. The flute's pitch is always somewhat-- Press your lips as much as possible and blow harder. Isn't it piano? You need to make the sound soft by... It works. What did you have for breakfast? Dried pollack soup. - What about dessert? - Melon. You probably have a seed stuck in your reed. Take it out. What's with that look on your faces? You're so cool, sir! Have you no pride? I wouldn't do this if I were conducting professionals. I couldn't. How can a conductor tell a professional how to hold the bow, to check the reed, and change techniques? You should be offended. I can't tell you to boost an ego you don't have, so I'll continue on. By tomorrow, bow 100 times, play high notes in piano 100 times, and brush your teeth 100 times after eating. I'm going to check. Mr. Kim's going to lose all the enamel on his teeth. Why don't you ask him to gargle instead? Do you know why I didn't say anything to you? You're unworthy to talk to. Let's take it from the top! What are you doing? How can you not even play a note accurately? No lunch! Practice on an empty stomach! I'll come back in an hour! Don't come in. Sorry, I came in. I'll leave soon. Wow, you have your own office. Nice. I thought you were practicing under a tent in the countryside. - Did the mayor call you? - Yes. And you came running? Someone who won a medal has nothing better to do? I don't. I'm bored. Where are the orchestra members? That way? Let me see how good they are. Don't go. They're practicing. Leave them alone. I hear they're second-rate. They practice hard. Practice isn't enough. That's why I turned down the offer. How could I make it work with a cabaret worker, a stay-at-home mom and a senior citizen? On top of that, the concert is in two weeks. That would be difficult even if they had 20 years. You did it. Oh, the elementary kids? That was a children's song. Even if kids never played an instrument, they pick it up fast. They're flexible and they listen to you. And they're adorable. The audience ignores it if they make mistakes, but these are grown adults. Who would tolerate mistakes? Their hands are stiff, they don't listen and they can't play confidently. Bad habits learned at the cabaret can never be fixed! It will last for life. You know that. Besides, you don't pay attention to detail. What are you talking about? You know exactly what I mean. You're not considerate to the orchestra members. You don't act according to others' feelings. You can't do it. That's the most important thing! Gun-woo. How's my tune? Is it still off? It's okay. What do you mean, man? It keeps echoing. I won't ask you to conduct, so tell me how it sounds. It's vibrato. Go slower in slow songs. Slower? Hey, it works. Okay, let's try to play together. What about me? Am I really not even worth talking to? Is it utterly terrible? Don't ask me. I won't butt in anymore. I must be horrible. I wouldn't say anything if you were completely bad. You're doing great. - I want to ask too. - Really? Me too. Stop it. I won't say anything, so don't come. Don't go. He's not going to conduct anymore. - Just tell me how I'm doing. Please? - Please take your seats. - You're good. You keep speeding up. - Let's see how we sound. - Me next. What about me? - You're perfect. Ju-hui! This is an emergency. Am I okay? Can I continue to play like this? Yes, but you need to be a little more confident. - Gun-woo! - You're too soft so-- Kang Gun-woo! What about me? What do I need to improve? You have to work on many things. He knows you. You need to compliment them too. They're amateurs. You need to be like a mom cheering them on. But can you do that? No way. We just have different styles. Exactly. Did I say otherwise? That's why you bring out the best in professionals. I acknowledge your style, the beauty in anxiety. But it won't work with amateurs. Amateurs mess up when they're nervous. Gosh. It's not like you can change your life-long style overnight. It's a match made for disaster. I feel sorry for both your orchestra members and you. - Leave. - Already? I canceled a dinner party to hang out with you. Let's go. Don't waste your time on something that won't work anyway. Why don't you come and have some sashimi with me... Your nostrils are flared again. You're about to burst. I'm off. Call me if you change your mind. Hang on. Isn't this part awkward? Maestro Kang said something like it has to feel like morning. It has to sound more upbeat and clear. Are we really going with Maestro Kang's interpretation? Of course. It has to sound-- My neck hurts. Talk from the front. I'll just say it here. William Tell is Swiss. So like a shepherd tending sheep on a prairie. Especially the English horn. Like that? Don't you want to slap that kind of sheep? What about a sheep like her? You're making me want to hurl. What about a sheep like me? You're the best. I want to be held by a sheep like you. It's this mood. Refreshing, cheerful and clear. You're doing well, so cheer up. Shall we give it a try? You need to compliment them too. They're amateurs. You need to be like a mom cheering them on. But can you do that? No way. Yes, sir. Your arm... - Are you hurt? - Have you been a class president before? - No. - What about a club president? Have you been a leader of anything? Then why do you like butting in? You must be dying to lead in front of people. Fine, I'll let you do it. Orchestra leader? Conducting. As you can see, it'll be difficult for me to conduct. I'll be fine in two weeks, so I'll conduct at the concert, but not the practices. So you lead the practices. Are you really allowing me to conduct? You'll have to appease everyone like an assistant and relay my messages. I think of it as a puppet, interpreter or designated driver. Other people might think you're conducting. If you do as I say, you'll learn a minute aspect of conducting. Make a choice. Do you want to be an assistant or a trumpeter? If you'll allow me, - I'll definitely-- - Fine, I'll take that as a yes. By the way, how did you hurt your arm? I just hurt it. Why? Do you think I'm making it up to make you conduct? Not at all. I was just... Follow me. Let's begin. What did I say you needed to express in that part? Like the Swiss Army March. Yes. Express that through music. Why are you getting excited? Are you dancing up there? You need to look more serious. Think that you have heavyweights on your arms. - Okay. - And in the last movement, bar 455, letter Q, Tutti Sforzando. Everyone has to come in together in sync. But they're all over the place. One, two! Can't they keep the beat? If you mess up one more time, they can't go home today. I'll make them practice until they get it right. Tell them. Good. Mr. Kang says we're much better. But you know the last part, bar 455, letter Q? This part is when we have to sound like a victory bugle call. Let's make sure we come in all together in one mind and soul. I'll give you a sign, so watch me closely. Okay. Not bad. What are you so excited about? You just started to crawl. - How do you do? - How are you, Mayor? - Nice to meet you. - Likewise. How are you? Thank you. - We can't cancel it? - Dad. - Dad. - The posters are already up, and we already sent out all the pamphlets. We can take down the posters and take back the pamphlets. What's so hard about that? - We already scheduled interviews. - Hello. We'll be criticized if we cancel it now. Pay them off. Whatever it takes to keep their mouths shut. - How are you, Mayor? - Hello. - My business is doing great thanks to you. - Is that right? I'm glad. - I wish you good health. - Thanks. Thank you. Mayor Kang. Didn't you always say not to do such a thing-- I said it because I was mad! Seriously. What is that young fellow doing here? Hello, Assemblyman Choi Seok-gyun. What brings you here? It's long before the elections. Are you campaigning already? What do you mean? As a politician, you have to always be interested in the people's affairs. The poster looks great. Seokran, the City of Music. - I have high expectations. - I see. But-- Making Seokran a City of Music during your current term and pledging a cultural zone designation during the elections. What a wonderful idea! As a cultural zone, people's home prices will go up, and you'll get reelected. I'm no competition for you. Sometimes, plans do not always go as-- My pledges can't compare to yours. What use is it for me to raise my approval ratings? I respect you. If I weren't running for mayor, I'd be helping your campaign. There are rumors you're having problems with the concert. It isn't true, is it? I'm just concerned as a citizen of Seokran. Are you really having the concert? THE ELECTION IS APPROACHING. WHAT IF... Didn't he cancel it? What happened to his ambitious plan of Making Seokran a City of Music during his term? He blew 300 million won of your hard-earned tax money and canceled the concert! Mayor Kang Chun-bae shouldn't be running for re-election! He needs to take full responsibility of this fiasco and step down immediately! Number Two Choi Seok-gyun! Number Two Choi Seok-gyun! Number Two Choi Seok-gyun! I, Choi Seok-gyun, will save the city of Seokran! I'll revive this city that was ruined by a certain someone whom I will not name! Kang Chun-bae! Kang Chun-bae! Number Two Choi Seok-gyun! - Number Two Choi Seok-gyun! - Kang Chun-bae! Number Two Choi Seok-gyun! I'm sorry. Mayor, they're practicing. Mayor Kang! We need to do this concert no matter what. Who said we weren't? Please leave. What are you doing in the middle of the rehearsal? I came because you were rehearsing. Here. Please continue. I'm going to postpone the concert as much as possible. But I need to hear how good you are. Go ahead. Are you saying you're going to evaluate me? I don't know how to apologize to you, sir. But the skill level of these people are so... You know what I mean. Ready, cue! Do you know who wrote this? I've heard it before. It's Schubert's "Die Forelle." Oh, I know Schubert's "Die Forever." It's famous. But he never received any recognition during his time. He couldn't afford to buy a piano, so he had to compose with a guitar. It's because of people like you who only care about one's experience. It's common for young people not to be recognized. But... There aren't that many young people here-- He never got recognition his whole life! He died of poverty. And Rossini who composed our main piece "William Tell's Overture." He was so poor. He played the piano at a theater. Chopin was malnourished. Schumann attempted suicide because he was mentally ill, and Vivaldi died in a slum in his final years. You'd kill all these incredible people, Mayor Kang! Well, it was inevitable during those difficult times-- I was poor too. I didn't have any experience. I never had private lessons in high school because I had no money. I didn't have a piano, so I'd go to school in the middle of the night to practice. I sold my bicycle and books to compete, but I didn't win. So? Do I have to kill myself then? Are you saying I don't have the right to do music? - Isn't Maestro Kang from Gangnam? - That's right. I thought he was from crème de la crème because he always mentioned aristocrats. I don't care what you say. However, a layman like me thinks experience is important. It's not just me. Everyone is like that. Many people think that way. How can I resist the flow and make a change? Well, Mr. Jung Myeong-hwan's conducting career is a little better than yours-- He only won a few more awards. And our orchestra members are doing their best. How dare a low-level employee talk back to me? Who created this whole mess? How dare you? Get out! And bring me your letter of resignation now! Sit down. What are you doing? I told you to sit! - She's my employee! - She's my concertmaster! She's my concertmaster and they are my orchestra members! I won't stand for you disrespecting them! I'm the only one who can disrespect them! They're mine! I don't care if you're the mayor or the President. Are you confident? Will you take responsibility? Apologize for barging in during our rehearsal. Mr. Kim, can you jot this down? Yes, of course. - Write it. - Write what? He said the orchestra members are all his. Write an affidavit. How much did we spend on this concert, 300 million won? - Tell him to pay all of that! - Mayor Kang. Write down that he's the one who got all these pitiful orchestra members and that he'll take full responsibility for the concert! That's right. Should I add that you'll quit conducting for the rest of your life? Of course, only if the audience response is pathetic, that is. Have you ever gotten a foot massage? I worked part-time doing that while studying abroad. If we're not well received by the audience, I'll massage your feet for the rest of my life. I'll quit music too. Satisfied? Place. Seokran Art Hall at 6:00 p.m. - Music interpretation notes? - I've handed them out. I burned CDs and gave them out. - Tomorrow, the first players-- - What about the ones who need help? Gun-woo will give private lessons to Bae Yong-gi. The woodwind section will practice at Kim Gap-yong's house starting tomorrow. Park Hyeok-kwon can take care of the cello and double bass. What about the violin chatterboxes? Chang Yeong-sik and I will... Oh, that's right. They wanted me to give this letter to you. Read it. "Dear Maestro Kang. You were super ultra cool today. We really didn't know how much you cared for us. You rock. You're the bomb, Maestro Kang. I love you." What's with the way they talk? They're young. They use a lot of slang. But sir. You know how you said "my concertmaster, my orchestra members"? Does it mean you've begun to acknowledge us a little tiny bit? I'm your conductor, aren't I? Conductor and orchestra members, we're one body. That's why if the concert goes wrong, you'll massage Mayor Kang's feet. Who's going to open the second act with the solo for "Libertango"? I asked Mr. Kim Gap-yong... Sir, is your arm all right? It's getting better. What did he say? He said it would be an honor, but he doesn't think the tone is right. The oboe isn't strong enough. Who else? Mr. Kim Gap-yong suggested Gun-woo. Is Gun-woo the cure-all master key that opens all doors? Sorry, I'm late. Still, Gun-woo's the second best after Mr. Kim Gap-yong. He didn't go to music school, he can't read music, and has never led anything. How can he play a solo? Do you think that makes sense? Sir, he can read music now. Right, Gun-woo? You can play "Libertango" right? He just started to read music. Ru-mi, did you see the new posters by any chance? The print's wrong. The date is wrong. {\an8}AUGUST 21, 2008 It's the 21st. Isn't it the 14th? - Did it get postponed? - Yes. Mayor Kang wanted us to practice more. Wait. Do you have to go back to work? Yes, that's my first day back. What's the big deal? Postpone your reinstatement. That'll be difficult. I was on probation. I don't think I can-- What kind of work is so inflexible? Resign! Quit! So what are you going to do? Miss the performance? Write down that the second opening act solo is Kang Gun-woo. Sir! You used Thoven to get me to conduct. How can you weasel out now? You can't. That's unacceptable! Don't just stand there! Go beg the Police Chief or cause trouble to extend your probation! You have to do something! Gun-woo! Don't go too far. Our performance is a one-time gig. It doesn't make sense to risk your job. What about you? You got fired. Well, I messed up. Do what you can and drop out if you need to. I'll take care of it. Postpone your reinstatement? Do you not want to work? Are you the Kang Gun-woo I know? What happened to the hardworking Gun-woo in just two months? Hey, can't you see we haven't been able to go home covering your schedule? When you come back, it'll be during APEC. One hundred percent of our workforce will be working two full shifts. We can't exclude you! Isn't there any way? There's one. Leaving the force. Right. I understand your situation. But can't you play the trumpet on any given day? Call them now and say you're dropping out of the concert. I'll go meet with the Chief. Hey, are you out of your mind? - Why that... Hey, stop right there! - Stop it! It'll be two million won. We're going to audition for trumpeters, so we can't-- Anyhow, it'll be two million won. I added on 500,000 won as insurance to prepare for something that can happen like last time. And what? Audition? I'll tack on another 100,000 won for the audition. Mr. Kang Gun-woo? How are you... It's an honor. I can't believe I'm meeting a person who perfectly reconstructs classical music true to its time. It's truly an honor. Thank you. I'm very well aware of your strive for perfection, sharp tongue and spirit. It'll be greatly appreciated if you were to teach and criticize me! I'll do my best! You tried your best, but I'll see you next time. Great job. Yes, I understand. Thank you. Here's the money you mentioned-- It's okay. It was an honor just to play for you, sir. I'll come watch the concert. Thank you. Didn't I tell you not to get another trumpeter? Why did you do such a thing? Gun-woo can't come, sir. I wouldn't be able to come if I were Gun-woo. Then we'll just play the accompaniment. Tell the audience the trumpet solo is busy giving out parking tickets as we speak. Sir. I wouldn't be as angry if he hadn't butted in! He lectured me about conducting, and now what? He didn't know the date? Are you kidding me? An orchestra is an ensemble. His talent aside, we can't find someone who can replace him because everyone's accustomed to him. I'm sorry. I should've told you sooner. This all happened because of me. I'm really sorry. If something does go wrong, I'll be sure to massage Mayor Kang's feet. That won't happen! As long as I'm the conductor, I may stop the concert, but I won't mess up. That can't happen. I'm the conductor. Hey, Feisty Chicken. Chin up. A dejected feisty chicken is useless. Hello. Where's the strawberry milk? Are you senile? It's right under your nose. Give me bread too. Aren't you curious as to what happened after you tattled to Mayor Kang? I know already. We found your replacement. She's pretty good. You must have brought in a pro after cheating me of my money. But she's not good as you. You're giving me the 200,000 won now? Are you kidding me? But too bad. I quit the flute. Because of whom? Because of you. My life's totally ruined because of 200,000 won. You completely screwed up this young person's promising future. Who? You. ANNIVERSARY CONCERT Why that annoying old... Are you still at the police station? - The Chief's office? - Yes. He's not in. Yesterday, he went home straight from the field. The Chief will be out all day today as well. Tell me where he is. If you don't, I won't leave. Sorry about that, Ru-mi. Did you spend the night there? I have to meet with the Chief. We're looking for a trumpeter. It will all work out. So Gun-woo-- This is Du Ru-mi. I called before regarding a trumpeter-- I see. I know it will be difficult... Your daughter is a senior in high school and your son is studying to go into oriental medicine, and what? - It's just a hobby... - Hobby? What kind of hobby requires you to go out at night and come home at dawn? Are you using orchestra as an excuse to go out dancing? No. She really played in an orchestra with me. If there's nothing to be ashamed of, why did you keep it a secret? All the church members knew about it. Why did you keep it from me? I looked like a fool! You said that women shouldn't... That's why I quit. You kept it a secret. How can I believe you that you quit? Why did you play in an orchestra anyway? Where did you get the instrument? Well... She bought a cheap one with the money she got from her late mother-in-law. What? You feed your husband, son and daughter nothing but rabbit food, and you bought yourself a cello? With my mom's money! - Why, you little... - Sir! I won't hit her. I'm just pretending to hit. Why did you play in an orchestra? Tell me! Well... So... - I felt-- - You felt what? I felt frustrated... - My name-- - Blurt it out already! No! I was frustrated just cooking and cleaning. The kids always... You... How dare you yell at me? That's why I did it! How much longer do I have to wait? Your mom passed away and you retired. How much longer do I have to wait? I'm Jung Hui-yeon. Why am I crap? You didn't even know I wasn't home. - What are you talking about? - I... My heart... Say something, will you? Go towards the hill. Ma'am! Why should I? Why should I look for someone who voluntarily left home? For what? SOLO 7D KANG GUN-WOO Speak of the devil. Why are you so late? We couldn't practice-- Is Gun-woo home? My nephew Gun-woo. He's not in? Did you have a lot to drink? I drank a little. Move out of my way. Wow, the house looks a lot better. So comfortable. What's with that look on your face? Are you upset because the crap came in? You hold grudges. "Crap" was brought up with regard to work. I guess you don't know how to distinguish work - from personal life-- - Hey, how old are you? I'm 52. I've lived ten years more than you. I'm like a big sister. We are not related, so you are not my sister. Really? Then... Little sister. Okay? I like that. I'll be your little sister. Is this the way to Gun-woo's room? The cello I hid should be there. But you know what? I can play the cello really well. SWEET GUN-WOO Your phone keeps ringing. Is it your girlfriend? DU RU-MI HOW CAN I HELP YOU? How can someone who has a girlfriend do this? The Captain and Sergeant are pissed off you're undermining their authority by directly talking to the Chief. Won't your girlfriend leave you if you're fired from work? Even if you talk to the Chief, - your direct supervisors will-- - Gosh. Thank you! I wish you good luck! He's coming. The Chief was going to go home, but he's stopping by because I asked him to. So please don't do anything that'll get me in trouble. Officer Kang Gun-woo, you can do it! - Why do you keep calling? - Leave a message after the beep. Come here and listen to your little sister play the cello. Is it the police station? Some lady is creating a ruckus. Give me a freaking break. Yes, my address is 94-1 Daetongmyeon, Seokran-- Hello? It's no use. People think you're nuts because you reported Gun-woo last time. The police won't come. Knock it off and come have a seat. I'll play you good music. What's the title? Right. "Crap." "Crap." You must've been deeply hurt. Okay, I'll tell you why. Your fingering, vibrato and bowing are all terrible. But I can endure all that. Why? Because you can practice. But you're bottled up. - What is? - The sound. It's frustrating. Something's pushing it down. It won't come out and it's circling around-- It's because of you. Didn't you tell me to leave because I'm crap? Yes, you're right. I'm frustrated. I'm bottled up. Why? You know, I went to music school. But people say I'm insane. They say it's crazy to join an orchestra after going to music school. Does that make sense? We're going off on a tangent. It's just once. I wanted to be in an orchestra just once in my life. Is that so crazy? Is it something I need to be yelled at for? My husband and kids do whatever they want to do. Why must I always give up what I want to do? Discuss your family problems with your family. I kept enduring and tolerating! For years, I cleaned my mother-in-law's urine and feces. Have you done that before? It makes you want to kill yourself! Then, my husband said he may lose his job and that I should wait more. So I gave it up again! But he got fired anyway. I don't know why I gave it up. I should've done it back then. I had to tolerate it because Jin-su had to go to college. After that, Min-ji entered high school. And Jin-su is going back to college again. Why is he going back to college at his age? I kept making sacrifices for years! At this rate, I'll never be able to play in an orchestra! Why do I always have to make the sacrifice? Why? Let's get back to the point. - Why is it my fault? - I just told you! I came to rekindle my love of playing the cello, but you blew out my flame, you jerk! You're the stupidest of all! I'm in this wreck because of you. Why don't we talk after you sober up? I'll get some rest in the meantime. Hey, you bastard! I'm talking to you. Take that off. Take that off right now! I'm talking to you! Hey! Take that off now! Can't you hear I'm talking to you? Your call has been forwarded-- How can he turn off his phone all day long? Is Gun-woo home by any chance? There's poop in there. Sorry? I'm talking about the cello crap. Get rid of her. Ma'am! Hui-yeon! Are you okay? Ma'am. What did you do here with Maestro Kang? Maestro Kang? I don't know. Gosh, what am I doing here? Let's go. Your husband is waiting for you at home. Yes, sure, I should go. What time is it? My, it's time for the orchestra rehearsal. You're planning on coming back? Absolutely, I'm fine. May I, Ms. Concertmaster? Ma'am, I think you're acting weird. I'll call your home. Look here, Ms. Concertmaster. Hello? Hi. It's Ru-mi from upstairs. Hello? It's me. I'm at the airport right now. Ma'am! I'm going to leave for Vienna to study music. Hey. What's wrong with you? - Are you crazy? - No, I'm not. The third drawer in the fridge has the side dishes, so have that. I was planning on making rice cake soup for dinner, so I soaked the rice cakes. Don't let it get too mushy-- If you come home, you're dead meat! Why are you doing this, ma'am? I told you my name is Jung Hui-yeon! Why do you keep calling me ma'am? I turned the house upside down and left home anyway. I want to perform just once in my lifetime. Why won't you let me? Who's the one who selected me at the audition? It was you! You're the one who told me to do it. Why are you stopping me? After the concert's over, I'm going to go home and beg. So don't try to stop me. Do you have a place to hide? Don't go far. Stay at Gun-woo's room upstairs. Your husband will never think of checking here. - Hello. - Long time no see. Thanks for keeping my seat. Hello. Sir, who's playing the "Libertango" solo? Why don't we randomly choose who'll play it? I'm going to draw someone's name from a hat. I want to volunteer my name! Me. I'm joking. Why isn't Gun-woo here? He's going to do the solo. How did it go? You'll do it, right? I'm sorry. I met with the Chief, and he said absolutely not. I have to drop out of the concert. I'm sorry. The performance repertoire will go as planned. If the concert is a failure, it's all because of you. They worked day and night for two months, skipping meals, but you would've ruined it. I'll see you at the concert. I'll be waiting for you. Hey! I-deun! I suck at flute. No, you can do it. I'll just keep it as a dream. I'm not telling you to realize your dream. At least dream of realizing it. Forget it! I'm going to quit the orchestra, the concert, and the contrabass. - Who is it? - Honey! There's a person... Hey! Stop right there! What are you doing here? We're performing on the first day? It's not for the Seoul Philharmonic... Did someone say I have dementia? Have you heard from Gun-woo yet? There must be a problem with the soloist. That Hui-yeon lady! That Hui-yeon lady was dragged away by some guy without her cello. As long as I'm on the podium, I won't ruin the concert. What? What's wrong? My ears... I can't hear.
