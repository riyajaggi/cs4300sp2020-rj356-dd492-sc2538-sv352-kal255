 He'll do it. I know he will. He has to do it. He should be here. Sir. I'm no Karajan. Please sit. May I ask you straight? What happened with the orchestra... You were great today. You did way better than expected.

 That's why they're planning to start a city orchestra. I've agreed to lead it. You totally rock! I'm totally moved! You're truly amazing. Thank you. I'm glad you're so excited about the city orchestra. Thank you. I'm very thankful for your passion for music. If you would support me as enthusiastically, my orchestra can be the best. As citizens of Seokran and classical music lovers, please support my orchestra and come watch us perform often. Sir, it sounds like you're talking to us in the third person... As orchestra members, what are we supposed to go see?

 The new orchestra will be comprised of top musicians from across the nation. Thanks for all your hard work. Don't tell me you thought you were going to be part of the orchestra. If you forgot, let me remind you one more time. You're amateurs. You enjoyed playing music, didn't you? As I told you before, you can't enjoy it once you're a pro. When music becomes your job, it's no longer enjoyable. Well, that's for us to decide. Aren't they starting up an orchestra after seeing our performance? That was us. We did it. That's right. Why did you wait for me? Weren't you wondering whether or not I was going to conduct the orchestra? In other words, you're very aware that it was created because of me. Not because of you, but because of me. The Seokran Philharmonic Orchestra that will be created is my orchestra. Is it difficult to comprehend that I want to make my orchestra the best by filling it with the best musicians? Don't you understand? Anyhow, you did a great job. If there's a performance, I'll be sure to ask the coordinator to distribute discounted tickets to you. From now on, I'll see you in the audience. Excuse me, sir. But... Sir! I can't believe he's pissing me off until the end! - Why should I-- - Sit down. I'll go. What? - Discounted tickets? - Sit down. Not even complimentary tickets, but discounted? Sir! No need to see me off. You can stop acting like the concertmaster. Then give us a chance. - At least a window of opportunity. - Auditions? Of course, I'm going to hold them. By invitation only for the top musicians. You people don't qualify. I know what you're capable of, and I'm sick of it. The skills you're sick of pulled off that performance. - Why do you think that is? - I'm not sure. Why? Did the heavens help? Did Mozart possess your souls? No, right? I think it's because of the conductor. We're not asking you to hire us because we're why the orchestra is being formed. We're not that shameless. But it's upsetting to give up like this. It's unfair! You worked with us for the past two months. You saw how hard we practiced! Do you still not understand how we feel? What do you want? Sugar-coated excuses? "I feel bad, but I can't do anything about it. You're adequately talented. You should succeed elsewhere and seek revenge." Is that what you want to hear from me? Sure. Other people, especially Jung Myeong-hwan, says things like that. Why? They don't want to be the bad guy. They don't want to feel uncomfortable. But what happens to the people who hear that? They'll waste years of their lives auditioning. "But Jung Myeong-hwan acknowledged my skills. He cut me although he didn't want to." They'll believe the lies. But that's not the case. When someone in charge fires someone, there's only one reason. Skills. I don't intend to be someone good in other people's eyes. But I think deceiving someone is far worse. That's the reason why I told you that you guys have no talent. Especially you, you can't do it. How can someone who is deaf do music? Don't you remember? You told me you couldn't hear. - It only happened once. - It's the beginning. If you don't believe me, get a doctor's note from this place saying there's nothing wrong. Don't try to deceive me. The doctor's my friend. If I do, will you accept me? I'll treat you as a normal person. ENT DOCTOR KIM DONG-JIN "I CAN'T HEAR" Mr. Kang Gun-woo referred me to you. You can't hear? It happened only once. I've been getting headaches, but they would get better with medicine. I only heard some ringing in my ear only once as well. He didn't believe me, so I wanted to show him I'm fine. There's nothing for you to examine. I'm completely normal. Don't say anything and don't move. I can hear everything. I went around all over Bulgwang and Miari today and asked around. He did. Is there a business that doesn't hold auditions? - Is there? - No! - Of course not. - Gosh. Even cabarets hold auditions to choose their musicians. How can the city orchestra... - Tell me about it. - We need to sue. - Hello. - Hey there. Will the police department take you back? I went there to submit my letter of resignation. - I ran into Hyeok-gwon on my way here. - Look at him. He quit his job as a police officer because of Maestro Kang. What's going to happen to him? Oh, my poor Gun-woo. How are you going to make a living? Who gave her so much to drink? How can she not drink after what happened? Our only hope is alcohol. - Let's drink, - Drink! barge into the auditions and compete fair and square. Cheers. He told Hyeok-gwon to go to the audition. I bumped into him and he told me he got a call from Maestro Kang. Park Hyeok-gwon? Double bassist Park Hyeok-gwon? The hot-tempered Park Hyeok-gwon who didn't even perform? Park Hyeok-gwon whose skill is at most par with mine? He talked about talent and that's all he could find? Hyeok-gwon is talented. He was famous during school, and he kept it up even while working. But still. How could he just call a few people and alienate us? That's why I turned down his offer. He called you too, sir? Yes. He said to audition if I was interested, but I'm too old. He said he understood and that he'll give it some more thought. But at least Maestro Kang is cordial to you. I suppose with your talent, he would want to eliminate the age requirement. He probably wants to recruit you. It's obvious he called you since you're talented. My phone is fully charged. But still. If he was going to call, he should call all or none. Isn't that the proper etiquette in the world of music? I'm so pissed. I hate being discriminated against. Hello? Yes, sir. Audition? I can't guarantee you anything, but I applaud your courage for giving up your job to perform, so seize the opportunity. Okay. This isn't an audition for a conductor. It's for a trumpeter. I don't teach lazy imbeciles who don't read music, so focus on the basics first. Conducting comes after that. - Okay. - That's all you can say? You could thank me, you know. Yes. Thank you. Is that all? Aren't you going to do your best? Yes, I'll... I'll do my best. It's like I'm begging for a thank you. Right, the day of audition and location is top secret. I won't tolerate old orchestra members barging in crying and begging me. Don't you dare tell Ru-mi. Got it? Yes, sir. Bye. You should audition. What's wrong with the mood? Gun-woo should audition. He even quit his job. Don't you agree? Yes. Of course, he should audition. Naturally. Didn't you already tell Maestro Kang how you feel? "Thank you. I'll do my best. Yes, sir." But you know what? I'm the one who covered for you while you were absent during the concert. While you were debating between conducting or being a cop, I was the one who quit the cabaret months earlier to play. What's the matter with you? I was the soloist and I'm not saying anything. She's the one who filled in for you. And she was incredible! Should I pass up on the audition? - What, punk? - Hey, what's wrong with you? I really don't know what to do. Why do you keep looking at Mr. Kim? You're in the same boat, is that it? You're very drunk. Stop drinking. Yes, it's not like you pleaded with Maestro Kang. You have to do what you have to do. Tell me one thing. When is the audition? Right, when is it? We want to go try out. But... He said it was a secret. Gosh. Gun-woo's inflexible. Come on, Gun-woo. Still, tell us. It's not like we're going to barge in and create a scene. Gosh, I have a sudden urge to drink. I'm going to drink until I drop tonight at a place where I don't have to see someone I hate. I know it's rude, but I'm going to excuse myself. I'm sorry. Mr. Bae. What is this mess? Gun-woo, you know Yong-gi isn't really mad at you, right? Stop it if you're going to say you're not auditioning. If you don't audition, he's going to be embarrassed for making a scene. Just audition. Humble all those talented people Maestro Kang likes. That's the only thing you can do right now. Mr. Bae! Mr. Bae! Mr. Bae, why are you doing this? Why are you taking it out on Gun-woo? He said thank you and that he'll do his best, right in front of us. You know Maestro Kang hates Gun-woo, but he called Gun-woo anyway. He acknowledged Gun-woo for the first time. But how can he say the hell with it? Would you if it were you? He could at least tell us when the audition is. We're like sailors without a captain. Our boat's about to sink. Who cares about his promise with Maestro Kang? The auditions start next Wednesday at 10 a.m. I really don't know the location. He says he'll text the morning of the audition. He says it's next Wednesday. Satisfied? All we have to find out is the location. RECEIVED MESSAGES DU RU-MI Where are you? My mom sent me some side dishes. If you're home, should I bring some over? I'm busy. Where are you? Are you out? I'm having dinner with 20 musicians you can't compare to. I'm busy, so stop texting me. Weren't you having dinner? Is this why you texted me? So you could confirm where I am and go through the trash? Well... Not really... You're outrageous. So can't you just tell me the location of the audition? Mr. Kim is so neat, he didn't even doodle anything. What are you doing? Tell me why you're doing this, on the count of three. - One. - Well... I know our skills are terrible. - Two. - So... We need to grab any little chance we have. - If we hesitate and lose it-- - Three. I don't want to make any excuses later on! Do you know how many excuses I have for not getting into an orchestra after music school and becoming a civil servant? I blame my mom, my friends and crappy teachers! They're all excuses! That's how big a coward I am. Whose fault could it be? I am to blame. Because I was lazy and I didn't try hard. But I realized that after I became a civil servant. I hate myself too. Why am I always a step behind? Why didn't I do it when I was supposed to? Why do I always regret it? I don't want a life of regrets anymore. I feel really pathetic and humiliated right now, but who cares? It's better than regretting not begging and pleading with you to let me audition. You don't want any regrets? No. You may end up with completely nothing, let alone regrets. You may lose everything. Sorry? It's next Wednesday at 10 a.m. at the cultural center practice room. I'm telling you because you were so determined to do it. Don't resent me later. - We're getting more food? - Wow, looks good. - Come join us. - Be careful. - You didn't have much. - Come join us. - Hang on. - Sure. - It's delicious. - We should come more often. She's such an amazing cook. We should come more often. - Ma'am! What is Mr. Park doing? - Yes? Tell him to wrap up the meeting and hurry back. - Okay. - Tell him to hurry up. - Help yourself. Let's have another drink. - All right. I love you, man. I know you're a good person. It's not easy for someone to throw a party for their junior associate who beat him to a promotion. I know it isn't easy. I know. I know. You didn't beat me to it. It's because you're more qualified. I hate it when you cut me off. Can't you just hear me out? Have you seen me cut someone off who's above me? I just listen. I listened to your nonsense when you were my boss. I think that's why I got promoted at a young age. Aren't we supposed to start off with the basics? Yes, you're well-equipped with the basics. Sorry? Yes, I know. I know. I'm cocky? Well, I don't know about that, but you think I'm cocky for distinguishing work life and personal life? Then I'll be cocky. I have no choice. Because it is important. - Don't you think? - Yes. Personally, this is my daughter's bed. My wife cleans this room spic and span-- Let's talk about work. Work! What are you going to do about the project draft? You're going to drop it and rewrite it, right? Why would you drop it? It's actually a good idea. You don't think it'll work? It won't work. No. Hello. Ru-mi? It's Hyeok-gwon's wife. How are you? Are you free to talk? Well, Hyeok-gwon received a text. About an orchestra audition... Oh my, really? He really asked my husband to audition for the orchestra? Hyeok-gwon didn't mention it to me. What happens if he's chosen? Does it have job security? How's the pay? I'm so upset these days. Hyeok-gwon was passed up on a promotion. For a younger friend, too. But he threw a party for him at our house to act like he's fine with it. Shouldn't he be worrying about himself? Right, you got a text earlier. They're going to hold the orchestra auditions at the cultural center. Why didn't you tell me about the city orchestra? Don't tell me you're not going to audition. Even with bonuses, it may be just two million won a month. Why would I go there for a two-million-won pay cut? Who works for the city orchestra for money? It's about honor. You'll be able to utilize your major, so you'll enjoy your job. You'll get requests for private lessons if you're in the city orchestra too. High school kids need extra lessons for college entrance, - so moms-- - Who said that? And besides, even if it were true, don't you know how much I detest that kind of education frenzy? You want me to make money off of that? What do you take me for? How much do they pay? What? Private lessons. It's quite a lot. It depends on how much you work, but they say you'll make much more than what you're making now. And you'll be a freelancer, a professional. I was thinking, it'll be great if you joined the city orchestra. It'll give you more job security compared to your current job. At your current job, you'll start to get pushed out once you hit 45. Unlike now, you don't have to worry - about your younger-- - What about now? What about my younger friend? Didn't I tell you I passed it up? There are tons to do, but he's twiddling his thumbs. I recommended him for manager, so he can take on responsibilities. Can't you tell from how I threw him the party? I know. I do, but can you at least audition? I'm not going to. It's such a great opportunity. You never know, - so why don't you-- - I said no! Mister, what a cool screen name. I bet you have killer biceps from golfing. Do you get muscles from golfing? Just say everything's cool. Guys are simple, so they'll do anything for you if you compliment them. Wow, you're so cool. So awesome. Super cool. Man, I don't want to do this anymore. This is so annoying. It gives me the chills. What's his username? "I'll buy you everything"? Kiss my ass. Why? He says he'll buy me everything. Would a guy who can buy you everything be chatting you up? I bet you he's broke. Tell him your price and drop him. - How much? - Per hour, 100,000 won. Definitely for 150,000 won. What's for 150,000 won? That? Idiot, 100,000 won is for that too! You're so naive. Are you proud of yourself for sleeping around? Look at you. Didn't you beg me to teach you how to make a fast buck? - You didn't tell me it was this. - What's wrong with this? Idiot, you scrape off posters, collect papers, and work at a convenience store all day. How much do you make a month? Do you even make a million won? You'll make that in five days with this. You can make five million won in a month. What better way can you make money? Forget it. Move. I didn't say I wouldn't do it. I won't do it for less than 300,000 won. What will you do about it? Hey, don't overcharge him. There are rules in this world. Who cares? I want to make money fast-- HOW ABOUT A MILLION FOR THREE HOURS? - A million won? - What? Hey, what? A million won for three hours? Who is he? Give him to me. - I'll-- - What's wrong with you? He's mine! Let's meet now. Where are you? RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU You brat! Let go of me! What are you, Grandpa? A stalker? Didn't you want to meet now? I can buy you anything. I'll buy it for you. Let go of me. Are you embarrassed? And yet you do something like this? Why are you so weak? Did you not eat? Hurry up with the sausage and seaweed wrap! It has been over 20 minutes. When are you going to relieve me of my shift? Give her money. You said to order whatever I wanted. I'm sorry. I'll make this quick and send her in. Man. How did you get my username? Her. You said one million won for three hours, right? You have two hours left, so say what you came to say. Why are you so desperate for money? What? Money's the best! You don't like money? Don't be absurd. If you don't, give it all to me! Your family may have financial woes, but they make enough to get by. Why did you drop out of school only to skip meals and be obsessive with money? I want to be a tycoon. Money is the goal of my life. You like to talk in English, right? Goal. So why? In your eyes, I'm young and despicable, right? But I'm pretty meticulous. I've already planned out what I'm going to do for the next 15 years. How? I'll start an online business with five million won. A fortune-telling site. What do you think? Not bad. Good, right? Everyone has their fortune told at one point or another. I don't need much capital because I'm not selling products. It'll be free at first, then I'll start charging when it takes off. I'll do that for five years. Then it'll be 50 million won. Yes, so? I'm going to invest that money in stocks. But I have a rule. I'll only aim for five percent every month. I'm not going to invest more money. I'm going to take the safer route by reinvesting my earnings. At a five percent rate of return monthly, it'll be 100 million won in 16 months. After 5 years and 4 months, 800 million. After 10 years and 8 months, 12.8 billion. Isn't that awesome? I'm going to be rich in no time. I never asked how you were going to make the money. I don't care. Sure, 12.8 billion won is nice. So? What are you going to do with that money? I'm going to buy pastries. Why? Why are you so obsessive about it? I'll buy pastries, a house, a bed-and-breakfast, travel, set up a foundation... - I have tons to do. - Foundation? For what? Your vocabulary is bad, isn't it? Are you sure you didn't mistake that word for something else? You must be confused-- Yes, foundation! I'm going to set up a scholarship foundation. I'm going to use 10 billion out of the 12.8 billion won to help kids. I'm going to find all the kids who gave up on music because they didn't have money and pay for their school tuition, food, books and private lessons. I'm going to support them like royalty and give them their own private studios. I'll send them overseas to study too. Then... I'll support a really gifted flutist. "You can do music even if you don't have money." I'm going to make that person a legend. You're right. You do have to become a tycoon. Gosh, this... Gosh. This 400-million-won item is just lying around. What are you doing? Leave it! You know your flute? It's made out of nickel, but it's worth 400 million won. Sell it. You need capital. Why? You can't sell it because there's no buyer? Should I buy it then? Give that back! What about this? I'll pay you twice as much. Let's break it. Whatever your plans are, they all sound immature to me. But you don't like hearing that, right? So let's break this. The end of your music career and the beginning of your tycoon dreams. How about it? Should I break it? Yes? Yes, do it. Break it into pieces! What? You can't do it now? Hey! Hey! I-deun! Satisfied? Are you happy now? There's a contest for young gifted people. Shut up. They choose poor kids like you and send them off to college and even overseas. - If you practice a bit more-- - Shut it. I suck at flute. No, you can do it. You have a solid foundation, and lately, you've been sleeping just four hours to work. Why don't you practice like that for just three months? Contest for gifted kids? You can win that. Who am I, I-deun? I used to be the first oboist for the Seoul Philharmonic. I've judged many contests like this. I guarantee you. You'll make it. You can do it! Legendary flutist? Why let someone else be that? Why spend your hard-earned money for someone else's success? You can be the legend yourself. Be a legend to the kids who gave up music because they didn't have the money. Okay, you may begin. I have a confession to make. I didn't really ask you here to audition. - Pardon? - I was going to scold you for disappearing two days before the concert. But you weren't bad. You're not at your best though, right? Did you have a lot of things bottled up inside? If you take a look at my resume, I received a few awards in college. And I've been practicing continuously. - I never quit playing. - Anyhow, you gave your best performance today. You know you have to quit your job if you're chosen, right? - Sorry? - You may leave. Next! Mr. Kim. What? I haven't made up my mind yet. About what? I didn't really come here to play for the city orchestra. - Okay. - I wanted to test the waters. What? I left work saying I had an appointment to come today. But I don't know if I could quit work right away. - What do you want me to do? - Come here for a second. - What? - Just a second. Just a second. - He's good. - He's so good. - He's so good. - What should we do? He's good. - Don't be nervous. - It's okay. It's okay. Is she here for a party? Her outfit is so fancy. That shows she isn't confident in her skills. She's scared, afraid, frightened. Musicians need to dress moderately and modestly. - Simply. - Be quiet. - Why are you being mean to him? - What did I say? You look very pretty today. - Be quiet. - Okay. Look at that person. - He's looking at our concert pamphlet. - You're right. I have the urge to tell him I played in the concert. I know. If we show off our skills, we'll crush them all. That's right. Sure. Gun-woo. - Hello. - Gun-woo. Why are you so late? Mr. Kim was looking all over for you. That's right. Gun-woo was invited to the audition. If you don't make it, I'm going to scold you. - Do well. Good luck. - You're so lucky! Yong-gi, I'll go audition now. I'm sorry, do I know you? You must have me confused with someone else. Hurry up and go. Do well. Good luck. - I'll be back. - Good luck. Why were you so late? Hurry up and go in! Ru-mi and all the project orchestra members, hurry up. Mr. Kang says to come in and watch. Hurry up. - Mr. Kang wants us to go in. - Hurry! Move out of the way! Move! Go ahead and play. Stop. Classical music is "blank." What do you think it is? Why are you laughing? I don't know much about classical music, but music is... No, an orchestra brings happiness because you're together. That's boring. You need to be wittier. On your way out, stop by the office to hear your schedule. Next. Did he make it? What is she saying? She keeps saying first. Does that mean she's been the lead many times? I don't know. She should speak Korean in Korea. Who doesn't know English? He can't accept a person like her. No way. She's good. She's even better than Mr. Kim Gap-yong. Ru-mi, I'm sorry. I have a family emergency. That's great. Where are you going? It's your turn. Come and try out. What's wrong, Hui-yeon? Do you feel sick? What should I do? The people here are all so good. I'm terrible. I'm nothing compared to them. I'm so stupid. What should I do? I totally humiliated myself. Enough. Next. I'll play my heart out. Stop! I played my best! You were the last one, right? Tell everyone to come in. Didn't you guys insist on coming to the audition, but is this everyone? Fine then. The average score of the people who auditioned before you was 7.2. As you know, I'm pretty harsh. I'll call out your scores. Hong Jun-gi 1.7, Jung Hui-yeon 2.8, Kim Ju-hui 2.3, Kim Ju-yeon 2.5, Kang Ju-mi 1.5, Park Jung-gwon 1.8, Du Ru-mi 2.9, Nam U-gil 2.6, Bae Yong-gi 1.1. Any objections? From your expressions, I see your passion to continue doing music has vanished. What do you think, Ru-mi? Do you feel good hitting rock bottom? Didn't I say you'll end up with nothing, not just get rid of your regrets? You brought this on yourself. Wasn't 1.1 too harsh for me? This is so humiliating. Didn't you hear me? Was I a 1.1? Ladies totally dig me. This isn't right. How could I only be a 1.1? - How? - Don't talk to me. I'm not a 1.1, right? Are you cheering me up? Okay, I need to energize myself. Give me some of your beef too. It looks delicious. What did they say? Weren't you supposed to stop by the office to hear announcements? Yes, I had to fill out and sign a letter of intent. Next Wednesday is the first day of practice. You made it? Wow, congrats-- What's wrong? Are you hurt? I pulled my neck a little. I've been practicing like crazy for the audition. I got over a two only because I practiced like crazy. I would've gotten a zero otherwise. Why don't you try out for a music club? I was part of one, but it got dissolved. Look online. There are many clubs that perform once or twice a year. That's too far away. I need to perform in four months. Why? Because after four months I'm going to go deaf. What did you say? Why would you go deaf? The doctor told me I have a tumor in the auditory nerve or something. You know I get headaches often. I guess that's why. Hey, are you... Come out. I haven't finished eating! How could you eat? I'm not full yet. It'll be a waste if I don't finish it. Eat. It's good. The tumor's big, so they have to remove it, but I'll still go deaf. If I'm going to go deaf anyway, I'm going to hold out for as long as I can hear and get surgery then. Is there another way? There's no other way? The doctor said he'll look into it, but he didn't look too confident. People die if they have tumors. Don't you think I'm lucky? I'm only going to go deaf. Is this your personality? Do you make a huge deal out of nothing and brush off things that are huge? You're way too calm. This isn't normal. I wondered the same thing, so I wanted to get wasted and cry by myself. But I felt better because I was buzzed, and I couldn't cry at all. So I tried to think sad thoughts and be emotional, but I woke up in the morning and realized I had fallen asleep. Don't you think I'm ridiculous? Well, I guess it's like this. You don't know when you have a cut at first. You know when it bleeds or stings. I don't think it hit me yet. See? People are laughing and talking. It's the same. Nothing has changed. I feel better since I have someone who's worried about me. Maestro Kang... You can't tell him, okay? I only went to see a doctor because he nagged me to. He'll jump for joy if he finds out. I hate his guts. Is there a place I can join? I want to play in an orchestra while I can still hear. Why are you leaving? Is there someone here you can't stand? Hey, can we get non-regular members? Who? Are you referring to the old orchestra members? Did you see their scores? No, even if you didn't see, don't you know their abilities by now? And Ru-mi has problems with her hearing. Her ears were ringing during the concert. You turned her down knowing that? Is it really bad? No. She got examined and she's fine. I hear there are backup performers you call when there aren't enough musicians for the concert, like interns. Can we do that at least? I wonder. It's the same as guest musicians. You don't have to pay her. Interns work for free anyway. She knows you, so she'll do as you say. That's a good idea. I don't have to pay her. I only have to call her when she's needed, so no hassle. Not bad. Then-- Why doesn't she do a bit more? She can observe every rehearsal. Sorry? Tell her to stand from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. The practice room is small. She just has to listen to the practice. Oh, it's okay if she takes notes from time to time. I'll assign her homework to write down what she felt during practice. I'll fire her whenever I want. She can't quit since she's technically a member. She won't get paid, can't practice, and she'll stand all year long. Okay, that's good. I welcome anyone who's willing to do that. Sir, what I'm saying-- Right, I already chose what we'll perform for the next year. The people we have in woodwinds are more than enough. They'll never perform on stage. - That makes no sense. - That makes no sense. Who does he think we are? Why make us observe if he's not going to pay us or allow us to perform? Are we cattle? Totem poles? I thought it was ridiculous too-- - Why? I don't think that's so bad. - What? It's still an opportunity. We'll be first in line if they're short on people. He already has the year's schedule, - and they're all two woodwinds. - That's right. Mr. Kim, what does that mean? It's how the orchestra is comprised. You take the woodwind section as the basis, so two woodwinds. Four means four woodwinds. It increases the number of musicians in each section. Then we can be included somehow. See? Will he choose a piece that'll require more than two woodwinds? There's no hope. If it's two woodwinds, that means classical pieces like Mozart or Haydn, - but Koreans like romantic music. - That's right. Beethoven requires at least three woodwinds. What do you mean by that? Stop with the jargon and talk in lay terms. Seriously. What's your favorite symphony? Tchaikovsky's "Pathetique" and Dvorak's "From the New World." Part of those pieces require at least three or four woodwinds. You can't play with two woodwinds. That means we might be needed. Really? Does that mean we can perform? We have hope! You never know with Maestro Kang's personality. He might just stubbornly play Haydn and Mozart. Oh no, we have no hope. If it's a city orchestra, he needs to mix it up with the audience's taste. He can't do whatever he wants. Okay, let's analyze this. Which pieces only require two woodwinds? Beethoven's "Symphony Number Five" is two woodwinds. - Beethoven? - Wait, in the fourth movement, you need a flute, piccolo, bassoon and double bassoon, - so technically, it's three woodwinds. - Then it's not. - That's three. - Then... Going somewhere? Yes, practice. I have to master a piece Maestro Kang told me to play. You can play after hearing it once. Why do you need to practice? Sit down and help us come up with a plan. Tell him to leave. He's an official orchestra member. We're on totally different levels. He's high level, we're low level. Stop. Gun-woo, get going. Professionals are different. You need to practice hard. - Hurry. - Stay a while longer. Tell us what Maestro Kang said. - Stay a little longer. - Go, Gun-woo. I can't believe you're leaving. - Cut it out. - Sit down. - He's going to practice. - Go. Come on. Here, let's get back to the discussion. What else is there? Hey, Ms. Kim. Good to hear from you. Of course, I got promoted. - Man. - It's no big deal. Okay, I'll go. Bye. Mr. Kim! Mr. Kim! I asked you to sign all of these. You need to approve it so I can go home. The layout isn't right. Can't you change it so it's easier to see? This is clear enough. Okay, can you take a look at the other one? AWAITING APPROVAL What's this? I put it there this morning. Didn't you see it? I'm not sure. I can't believe you! Where are you going? Mr. Kim, just sign this for me. What's so hard about signing your name? I need to review it in order to sign it. Did I stop you from looking at it? - I put it on your desk this morning-- - One more thing, stop talking down to me. We're at work right now. I told you. You need to be professional. I know you speak with respect in front of others, but you can't change like this just because everyone's gone. It makes me feel uncomfortable. Does this place change into a cafe at night? You need to be consistent. Where are you going? Aren't you going to sign this? I'm going to have coffee with someone. I'll be right back. Okay? Yes. Yes, well. Sure. And you know... Why hasn't he gone home yet? What is he doing there? You know I'm the president's favorite. Just leave it to me. Okay? Anyhow, thanks for dinner. But I don't feel too good about this. Hey, you. Sign this. - Mr. Cha. - Yes? - Go ahead. - Sure. Did you just say, "Hey, you," to me? Yes. This is the last time I'm going to say this. Sign it. Look here, Mr. Park Hyeok-gwon. I really didn't want to do this but-- You won't? Fine. Hey! What are you... Hey, you douchebag. If you become a manager, does that give you the right to dump your work on your subordinates and go for coffee? Is this a cafe, you bastard? If you got promoted because you kissed ass, you should work harder. You mistreat those under you, kiss up to those above you, avoid responsibilities, and ask for wining and dining. Aren't you ashamed to face your family, you hyena scoundrel? Hyeok-gwon. Hey, you seem to be very angry. Yes, I'm pissed off. That's why I'm going to tell the bosses that I'm quitting because of you, and to fire you in order to save the company. Satisfied? What? Hey... Pick it up. - Throw it away. - Yes, sir. - Isn't it clean? - Yes. You lead a clean life too. Female workers hate you the most because you stink and you're annoying. Also why do you take off your socks anywhere? Wait, Hyeok-gwon! Are you really quitting? What will you do? I'm going to play for an orchestra! So? Take this. My arm hurts, man. Do you know what that is? - It's a sordino. - Punk. You're pompous until the end. You said you couldn't practice because you didn't have one, so I bought it for you. It's expensive, so handle it with care. Are you happy you're an official orchestra member by yourself? You need to practice like hell since you're the only one who made it. Take it everywhere you go, practice like hell, and live in prosperity, you cruel jerk. I'm going to be cruel and leave. Nice meeting you. There's one thing I'd like to say to you. Don't think the city orchestra is a guaranteed job. If you do, please leave right now. If you're not the best, I'll fire you and replace you. Every concert will be an audition. And... Whose seat is that? {\an8}KANG GUN-WOO Kang Gun-woo. Kang Gun-woo isn't here? Hello, sir. Why are you here? We're the backup performers. - What do you mean, backup performers? - I don't have to pay her. I only have to call her when she's needed, so no hassle. Not bad. Why were you so late? I'm sorry. Take your seat. - Look here, Ru-mi. - Yes. My place is here. I want to be together with these people. What? With your skills, if you got into the city orchestra... What I want to do is conduct. How much aspiration is burning inside of you? Mr. Jung Myeong-hwan? Please mentor me. This time it's a bit special. But I'm being lenient because I know you have an inferiority complex. Are we crap? Beggars? Don't look down on us, and bring it on! Get out. She refused to get surgery. She wants to play for an orchestra while she can still hear. Ludwig van Ru-mi. What's this? I heard Mozart did that, too. Did you try to do it like Mozart? - What's this? - Do, so. What are you doing? Give me a chord! Ti, do, re, mi flat, fa sharp, la flat! Do you know what it means to be deaf? Music will disappear! Your violin! Hey, stop right there! What did you learn all these years? Don't you know how to look past the curtain and into people's hearts? Hey! Ru-mi! Subtitle translation by Jeong Lee
