 He's going to do the solo. I'm sorry. I met with the Chief, and he said absolutely not. I have to drop out of the concert. The performance repertoire will go as planned. If the concert is a failure, it's all because of you. They worked day and night for two months, skipping meals, but you would've ruined it. I'll see you at the concert. I'll be waiting for you.

 Let's begin. I bought too many. You really don't want any? Don't worry about it. We already have five prospective trumpet players. I guess we look important, with all the posters and the promotions. We're going to hold an audition and choose the best one. But... Aren't you going to learn how to conduct? Did you lose interest? No, I don't mean conducting at the concert. Are you not going to do it at all? You were so into it.

 It stinks. It needs to be sprinkled with soju after grilling it the first time, but they grilled it without that. Ingrate. It tastes good to me. I used to sell this a few years back, but it didn't last long. I went to the army right after high school and I had nothing to do when it was over. I did all sorts of things. I thought I could take on the world. But money is so... I haven't snapped out of it yet. I fought tooth and nail to join the force, but I got into trouble and I was put on probation. My only thought while waiting for the Police Chief was, "Don't let this happen again. Concert? That's useless. Let's just lead a quiet life." But conducting? Conducting is nice. My heart pounds just thinking about it. But there's a time for everything. How can I, who didn't even go to music school, compete with hotshots who studied abroad? Don't you think it's worth a try? I'm not ambitious. I just want to live happily with my wife and kids in a condominium that is around 20 pyeong. I think that's the best. But does that sound easy? Not to me. Even that is tough for me. Why are you being so hard on yourself? I really didn't want to say these things to you. I'm being honest with you. I just feel like I should. Go. Yes, a trumpet player. Sorry, it's an emergency. Can you send a few people over? Isn't your leave only until today? Thanks for everything. Starting tomorrow, practice like crazy in the evenings. My company is moving two days from now. Really? You'll be busy. Oh, yes. Yes, thank you. Bye. Oh, my head hurts. Do you have anything for a headache? - We're starting an hour earlier tomorrow. - Two days from now? - Don't be late. - The day of the concert? - Okay. - Yes. So? I can't perform. So look for a contrabassist, too. The concert is in two days. How can I find one on such short notice? Isn't it just a move? Can't the movers take care of it? Are you that stupid? Haven't you ever worked before? Companies save money by making the employees do the moving. But isn't it just a move? I'm an entry-level manager! I rule my employees with an iron fist and kiss up to my supervisors! I have to look like I'm moving desks at the very least. I have no power! That's what I've decided after contemplating about it all day, so don't try to persuade me. I won't change my mind. Drink. I'm buying because I felt bad for being mean to you all this time. We're the same now. We're both dropouts. I'm good. Don't be intimidated. There's no need to be scared, man. It's not like we betrayed our country or sold out a patriot. You didn't want to be in the orchestra to begin with. It's the same for me. I only helped out because I felt bad for Ru-mi. I'm leaving because the time has come. Don't you agree? Let's be honest. I have a kid and a job. How can I ignore all that and perform? That's what you call crazy. Talents? Dreams? Are we teenagers? High school kids these days go to college according to their grades. They end up doing better later on in their lives. Who cares about your talent? Who cares about your dream? It's hard to put food on the table as it is. Should we get another bottle? No, it's okay. I have to go to work tomorrow. I can't work if I'm hungover. I want to get buzzed, but I can't even get drunk today. {\an8}2008 COMMEMORATION CONCERT 2008 COMMEMORATION CONCERT It's my first time seeing you in uniform. It's nice. You look great. It's your first day back at work. Good luck. Did you find a trumpet player? Yes, he's really good. He's a lot better than you. Your shoes don't match. I had to go to the dry cleaners early this morning. I got nervous as soon as I woke up. Bye. Did you really find a trumpet player? Yong-gi has improved a lot, and we can take out the solo. I'm more worried about you. Are you sure you won't regret it? We're on emergency duty starting today. I'll be busy. Should we have another one? Let's not put any soup in it. No soup in it. Here. Eat your breakfast, sweetie. Drink the soup slowly. Here's paprika. You're going to work like that? Without wearing a suit? Didn't I tell you we're moving? I don't want a dusty suit. Oh, can you stop by the dry cleaners on your way home from work, sweetie? I'm busy. I have to go to the OBGYN today. Got to the dry cleaners? For what? The tuxedo for your concert. I got it tailored. What do you mean? It's in the closet. That's old, so I bought a new one. Why did you waste money on that? I told you I'm not going to perform! Even if you don't today, maybe-- That won't happen! I was criticized for using up all my vacation days and for taking unpaid leave! You want me to do that again? There are music club concerts... Why are you getting mad? You're pestering me right now! It's hard for me as it is. What more do you want from me? - I only bought a tux-- - Forget it! I'm going to quit the orchestra, the concert, and the contrabass. - So either sell it or throw it away. - Stop it! Bo-ra, don't cry. It's okay. Daddy isn't mad. - Stop it! - Daddy isn't mad. It's all right. - Stop... - Okay. - I hate Daddy! - You hate Daddy? Where? Aren't you talking about your wife? I saw her earlier at the community center. There was a crowd of people going to the concert tonight. What's this? Why are there so many kids? Mayor Kang minimized the promotion of the performance. Naturally, the tickets didn't sell, so we gave out the remaining tickets - to elementary schools-- - Why not junior high or high school? He said the elementary school kids' reactions are positive. 2008 COMMEMORATION CONCERT Please look at me! Stop! Attention, everyone! Let me ask you a question. Where are you? - Art Center! - Art Center! That's right. You're wonderful. You're the best audience! Today is Seokran's Music Day. What are we going to play today? - Classical music! - That's correct. Who comes to mind when you hear classical music? Like... - Beethoven! - Beethoven! That's correct. You're amazing. Cool! Then... - Mozart! - Mozart! Mozart! That's correct. Everyone, you're so smart. Then let me ask you a question. Can you clap during the concert? - You can't! - You can't! That's right. Then... Can you talk during the concert? - You can't! - You can't! That's good. You need to brainwash them really well. I'm not brainwashing them. The customers are king, after all. Where in the world is Maestro Kang? Why isn't he here? Nice form. Are you using the baton technique I taught you? Since you're too dumb to remember the time of the concert, it starts at 6 p.m., and your solo is the first song of the second part. Are you happy? Are you happy being a replacement for a broken traffic light and inhaling fumes? Oh, I do admit that people are all different. Some think money is the best. Some are okay with just kimchi and plain rice. Some save all their money and donate it to charity in order to sleep at night. There's a variety. There's no right or wrong. Everyone lives according to their values. So Kang Gun-woo, are you happy right now with living according to your values? Let me ask you one more thing. Didn't you want to learn how to conduct? - I wanted to learn. - But? - I'll just keep it as a dream. - A dream? How can it be a dream if you don't strive for it? That's a star. That's something high in the sky, something out of reach and unattainable. Who said I wanted to talk about fantasies? You have to do something. You need to make an effort. At least come up with a plan and follow it to find your sense of style. That's how you can say it's your dream! Is your dream anything you want it to be? Then why don't you say your dream is to be a doctor, scientist, lawyer, and judge? I'm not telling you to realize your dream. At least dream of realizing it. What I'm saying to you is useless. Why should I care? You're the one who will regret it your entire life. This is all I can do. "I have no dream. I've never dreamed. I'm exhausted from life." Let those thoughts eat you up for the rest of your life. You'll conduct right before dying? Who cares if you scream on your deathbed? Hello. It's good to see you. Thanks for taking the time to come. 2008 COMMEMORATION CONCERT Hey, can't you do your job correctly? I'm sorry. Go ahead. - I'm sorry. - I almost got into an accident! I'm sorry. Go ahead. Jeez... Three minutes until curtain. Get ready! Why are you taking so many pills? You'll get addicted to them. I was so busy recently. I'll be fine. We're missing one person. Raise your hand if you know who it is. That lady! That Hui-yeon lady! I can't believe she's not here. - Hui-yeon. - Move. Ms. Jung Hui-yeon! Hui-yeon, pretty Hui-yeon. Don't be nervous. Just do what you've always done. Oh, my. Look at the time! Oh, my. Oh, no! Oh, gosh. What is wrong with me? I must be crazy. I must be out of my mind. I'm super late. - You just realized you were crazy? - Oh, honey... A concert? How can you perform after abandoning your husband and kids? - Come here! - Oh, my. Honey. I need to perform. - Come here! - My cello! - What are you doing? Who are you? - My cello! - Stop! - Get lost! Did you just push me? You can't do that! - Let go of her! - Stay out of this! Are you using violence? I won't tolerate it! You can't run away like this! What should I do now? Concert! The cello! Oh, no. We have a huge problem. What should we do? We have a huge problem. That Hui-yeon lady was dragged away by some guy without her cello. What are you talking about? I brought the cello, but I couldn't bring her. - Come in. - Oh, no. What should we do, Ru-mi? Go in first. Go in. - Let's go in. - Go in first. Go in. - Who dragged her away? - Some guy! I could only bring the cello. Should I go in? What should we do? What's this? What's wrong? Do you feel okay? Yes. I'm okay. You're okay? Let's go in. We're about to start. We deliberately asked children to come to the concert for the future of music in Korea, not because we couldn't sell tickets. I see. I can't hear. Hey, Feisty Chicken. Where are you looking? Look at me. Just follow my lead and you'll be fine. A bit smoother. A bit softer, as if it's from far away. Yes, that's it. You're doing fine, Feisty Chicken. Mic test. Feisty Chicken, mutt, idiot, moron. I can hear now. Have you heard from Gun-woo yet? No. That idiot. After everything I said, he still didn't get it. Gun-woo's solo is the opening piece after the intermission. What should we do? It was off today. I think it sounded fine. The violins didn't sound right. My husband and kids do whatever they want to do. Why must I always give up what I want to do? I kept making sacrifices for years! At this rate, I'll never be able to play in an orchestra! Why do I always have to make the sacrifice? Why? - Cell phone. - Sorry? Oh, Gun-woo? Want me to call him for you? Honey. Be quiet! All you'll do is talk about the concert anyway! Let's go. Let's go home and talk. RU-MI Hi, Ru-mi. I'm... Hui-yeon? Your husband took you? Where are you? Well, we... We just passed the Dongsin Intersection... You're still close. You'll be doing the solo, Hui-yeon. Come back at once! Pardon? Come and perform the solo. I'll relieve your frustrations. You have a pretty name, Jung Hui-yeon. Who was that? Are you really cheating on me? - Who was that? - Honey! There's a person... Hey, you! This happened because you keep talking nonsense! Hey! Hey! Stop right there! PART 2 The pieces have been swapped. They skipped the solo. They're performing the piece after it. Why is that? Is that so? But does the order really matter? Yes, it does. There must be a problem with the soloist. I guess it does matter. What the... What happened to the solo? Mr. Park, we're going home. If Gun-woo couldn't make it, they should've found a sub! - They're so frustrating. - Yes, spend the night. Hello. Hey, Mr. Park! Oh, yes... - Daddy! - Jeez. - What the... - Let's go! Let's go and watch it. I have the tickets Ru-mi sent me. The concert started a long time ago. How can we go now? If we go now, we can hear at least one piece. - Let's go. - How can I go looking like this? Who cares? Who will say anything? My husband was the lead contrabassist until yesterday. Let's go. Bo-ra, let's watch a concert with Daddy. What's wrong with you? I'm not going. Do you want to die? Why are you messing with my stuff? It's mine! - It's mine! - Mine! Stop it. No! Stop it! Sit down. What an amusing concert. Kids are crying and the pieces got switched. Ms. Jung is close. She's almost here. If you could buy us some time... "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star"? What's this song, everyone? - "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star"! - "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star"! Yes. That's what most people know it as. But this is actually a classical music piece called "Variations on 'Ah Vous Dirai-je, Maman'" which was composed by Mozart. Isn't it beautiful? - Yes! - Yes! Where are you right now? - Theater. - Concert hall. - Art Center! - No. We're in the land of classical music. Where are we? - The land of classical music! - The land of classical music! No, this is the Art Center! If you don't listen to adults, you'll go to hell. You'll burn to death in a fiery hell. Now, you tell me. Where are we again? The land of classical music! You're right. In the land of classical music, fairies die if you talk during the concert. Do you know the story of Peter Pan? - Yes! - Yes! It's similar to that. Do you want the fairies to die? - We don't want them to die! - We don't want them to die! What's the land of classical music? Please open the door for me! Pardon? I'm the cellist. I have to perform. - At this concert? - Yes, the cello. The cellist is entering. Thank you. Have you heard people say, "Bravo" while clapping after the music ends? - Yes! - Yes! "Bravo" is supposed to be said when one male performer did well. Since we have many male and female musicians, instead of "Bravo," please shout out, "Bravi." What should you say? - Bravi! - Bravi! Good. The traditions in the land of classical music are a bit complicated. That's dirty water. I gargled with it. You're supposed to clap when the music ends. Clap with all your might. - Okay! - Okay! But you can do whatever you want today. You can clap if you want, or not clap at all. Got it? - Yes! - Yes! - That lady is performing the solo? - Why? She's terrible. That lady is the soloist? They're completely insane. Oh, man. What the heck? Say something, will you? Blurt it out already! Didn't you want people to call you Hui-yeon? Do you know what that means? You need to own up to your name. Do you think you own up to your name? I'm Jung Hui-yeon. Why am I crap? What are you doing? I got you a trumpet. Go and get changed! Quickly! Took you long enough. Sorry, I'm late. Don't just stand there. Go in. Do you want to enter after the conductor? I'm glad you're here. This is the last piece. We're about to perform the overture from the opera William Tell, which is set during the 14th century, when Austria ruled Switzerland and when the Swiss farmers revolted. Our concert is the same. We don't have anything to offer, but we're going to stir up a revolution to show how good we are. I know you can do it well. I have faith in you. It's time. It's here. - Here. - Here. The part where we always messed up. Don't play a bar. Everyone, sforzando. This is it. Right here! Bravi! Mayor Kang, what did I tell you? - I told you it would be a success! - Yes. I told you to trust me. Didn't I tell you to trust me? It was the best! The best! You guys were amazing. Mr. Yong-gi. - Nice to meet you. - This is Mr. Yong-gi. - I'll take care of Ju-hui. - What are you saying? - Take care of Ju-yeon, too. - Ju-yeon too? I'll do my best, Mother. - "Mother"? You're crazy. - Sorry. - Yong-dae! Man-gu! - Sir! How was I today? - You rocked! - You rocked! - Should I show you again? - Yes! Come on. In one, two, three... Cheese! Mr. Kim, did you see my police uniform? - No. - Gun-woo! Come over here. Get in the picture. Hey. - It's in cabinet 7. Cabinet 7. - There? - I'll be right back. - Hurry back. - Hello. - Hi. Mr. Nam! Did you hear me? I was awesome. - Let's take a picture. - Sure, my pleasure. Are you ready? Hey, get in there. I'll take a picture of you two. The background isn't good. Come over here. Yong-gi, move out of the way! - Let's go. - Let's go. Get in the picture. No, I'll ruin the picture. No. Just the two of you. Take their picture. One, two, three! Did you come after work? I'm unemployed now, so you have to take care of me. Look at the camera. Don't you think we look like a married couple? Hey. It was great, I tell you. Okay, hold on. Hold on. Can you tell that I played an important role? - Absolutely. - Is that right? Grandma, come in. Tell the boss that I'm sorry and I'll be back soon to save the cabaret. No flowers? - Yes. - Mom, get in. - Grandma, sit down. - Okay. Dad, sit here. - Okay. - Mom, you too. Grandma, look this way. - Okay. Look this way, everyone. - They look good. Smile for the camera. Ready? One... One, two... Honey... You haven't eaten yet, right? I'll go home and make dinner right away. Just let me get my cello. Hey! Make dinner. Make our meals, pack lunches for Min-ji, support Jin-su who's applying for school, do the laundry, and clean the house all by yourself. I'm not going to lift a finger. And if you still have time after, then go for it. If you think you can. Why didn't you tell me? People think I'm a jerk. Honey! Wait. Let's take a picture together, too. What's wrong with you? We need to take a picture to commemorate this moment. Look at the camera. One, two, three. What's this? You need to smile. What's wrong with you? One more time. Okay, one, two, three. Smile! The waiting room is over there! - I want to get an autograph! - Let's go to the waiting room. You practiced with them until two days ago. You're an orchestra member, too. You should see them and take pictures with them. Forget it. I'm not going. Why didn't you perform, Daddy? Daddy's company moved. Why didn't you work hard at the company move? Because I was worried about the concert. Then why didn't you perform? Because of the move. Why didn't you work hard at the company move? Bo-ra. Because of the concert. Then why didn't you perform? Hey, Feisty Chicken. Where are you looking? Look at me. Just follow my lead and you'll be fine. Yes, that's it. You're doing fine, Feisty Chicken. Where is my sheet music? It's over there. No, send it to Vienna. It will just be dead weight. Are you leaving now? Yes, as soon as I load up my luggage. You don't have to see me off. I called a car. You did a great job. Can't you stay a while longer? - Gun-woo, have you seen Maestro Kang? - Have you seen Ru-mi? No, I haven't. If you see him, bring him to the VIP waiting room. There's big news! Big news! Hurry up and bring him. Why? Why should I stay? Well, it's been a while since you came to Korea, so you should travel and see your family... I don't need to travel, and I've already talked to my family. May I go, then? No. Give me 12 reasons why I shouldn't go. I want to know more about you. Second. I want to know you, sir. Can't you be more original? Third... Sir, I want to know you. Sir, Mr. Kim wants you to come to the VIP waiting room. Aren't you close to her? She said she wants to know me three times. What does that mean? - What does he mean? - What? Nothing. Let's go and celebrate. The others must have left already. Oh, my. Come on in! Sir, please have a seat here. This seat has the best view in the VIP room. It will be comfortable. This way, please. My bed is the most comfortable. Tell me what you want. If you're considerate, you would know how exhausting it is after a concert. You may be tired, but it was so touching for me. I've never been this moved in my 50 years-- Being moved is an obvious by-product of my conducting. So? It's not only me. The city councilmen and all the sponsors are in a frenzy. Sir, I'm so sorry for not knowing how incredible you are. I want to apologize. Can you cut to the chase? Okay, I will. That's why I discussed something important with the city councilmen and the sponsors. We're planning on creating a Seokran Philharmonic Orchestra. What are your thoughts on it? - A philharmonic orchestra? - Yes. That's what I heard from a conversation between Mayor Kang and the city councilmen. How? Why all of a sudden? Is Mayor Kang crazy? - Will we continue to play? - Who will be conducting us? - Is it Maestro Kang? - Will we get paid? How much? Will we be civil servants? Hang on. That's not what's important right now. It's not for sure yet. Didn't you say you were sure earlier? Well, I'm 99% sure, but there's a 1% chance, so... It depends on the conductor. Am I the conductor? Yes. I won't do it. Please think about it. I won't do it. How could you pull off such a magnificent concert with those members? This is all because of you. If you don't do it, I won't create the philharmonic orchestra. No, I can't. Then don't do it. How can an artist like you be so black and white? Don't limit it to whether or not you'll do it. Please answer it. {\an8}FEISTY CHICKEN I'm under a contract to do two concerts in six months with the Trondheim Symphony Orchestra. After that, I'm planning to go on a sabbatical. If we were to schedule-- Most importantly, I'm exhausted from this concert. I feel like I've worked for ten years. I won't do it. Can you please think about it constructively... Excuse me. Yes, Mr. Kim. Everyone has gathered? Okay, I'll be right there. Bye. Sir. Sorry, I have to go resolve an issue. Don't go. You cannot leave! Stay. Wait for a while. They're offering great conditions. Do you think I'm like you who works depending on the conditions? How can they start a city orchestra after one concert? But that's exactly what they're going to do. The city councilmen weren't that approving of Music Day, but they went wild after seeing your concert. They're the ones who brought up the creation of a city orchestra. Go ahead. Make it without me. It will be your own orchestra. Of course, I know people are lining up to recruit you because you're talented. But working six months here, one year there... Isn't it hectic? Be like Karajan. Be just like Karajan who had a lifelong contract with the Berlin Philharmonic, you can-- Is this Berlin? Their talent cannot be compared-- You can make it that way, man. I think they'll be offering you way better conditions than Karajan. Karajan asked for a lifelong contract, but they're offering it to you first. They're not going to interfere or bother you. They're going to support you and let you do whatever you want! Don't you want an orchestra that can read your mind? Choose the musicians you like, train them with your style, and create an orchestra that's yours forever. Won't that be great? Isn't that your longtime dream? If it's so great, why are you telling me to do it? I would do it in a heartbeat if I wasn't under a contract, man. Want to trade places? Do you want to take over my ten-year contract, and have me conduct here? Please... He'll do it. I know he will. He has to do it. He should be here. Chinese food isn't good when it's cold. Hold your horses. Just wait. Where is Gun-woo? He's at the police station. He wanted to formally apologize for abandoning his post, and resign. I feel bad for him. He was so happy about getting promoted next year. If they start up a city orchestra, then it's a blessing in disguise. Right? Will the city orchestra be practicing at the Art Center? Mayor Kang said he'll give a place for us to practice at the cultural center. How is the pay? Will we have set hours? Is there an educational requirement? Do high school graduates qualify? I know I'm good-looking, but do they look at appearances? Well, the basic pay should be at least 1.3 million won, right? That's it? That's less than what I got paid at the cabaret. It's a lot. The Seoul Philharmonic is paid higher, but we're just starting off. If you include the bonuses and allowances, it will be about two million a month. You can teach private lessons, and you'll get benefits as a civil servant. My father has always wanted me to be a civil servant. Our concertmaster is hired as soon as she's fired. You know that a city orchestra isn't created that easily, right? It all depends on Maestro Kang. I'm worried because he's already booked with other engagements. Sir. I'm no Karajan. Please sit. May I ask you straight? What happened with the orchestra... You were great today. You did way better than expected. That's why they're planning to start a city orchestra. I've agreed to lead it. You totally rock! I'm totally moved! You're truly amazing. Thank you. I'm glad you're so excited about the city orchestra. Thank you. I'm very thankful for your passion for music. If you will support me as enthusiastically, my orchestra can be the best. As citizens of Seokran and classical music lovers, please support my orchestra and come watch us perform often. Sir, it sounds like you're talking to us in the third person... As orchestra members, what are we supposed to go see? The new orchestra will be comprised of top musicians from across the nation. Thanks for all your hard work. From now on, I'll see you in the audience. But... Sir! The skills you're sick of pulled off that performance. I told you that you guys have no talent. How can someone who is deaf do music? What did you say? Why would you go deaf? They have to remove it, but I'll still go deaf. You're really quitting? What will you do? I'm going to play in an orchestra! So? Audition? I can't guarantee you anything, but I applaud your courage, so seize the opportunity. Classical music is "blank." What do you think it is? An orchestra brings happiness because you're together. Hey, Hyeok-gwon! You have an inferiority complex from being cut after your concert. What? An inferiority complex? How much aspiration is burning inside of you? Desperation. That's one thing you lack. If you want, I'll show it to you. You think you're always right. Subtitle translation by Jeong Lee
