 {\an8}Nice car. {\an8}You're so famous. I rented a nice car just for you. {\an8}I'm being sarcastic. Please get a different car, ma'am. One that's all black. Okay. Also, I'm young. You can speak casually with me. You look young. RESUME I thought about it. I can't play for him. Look for another trumpeter. Kang Gun-woo?

 Oh, he has the same name as you. - He's a trumpeter. - Seoul Arts High School, Seoul National University, Juilliard. Is that all? What about awards? If he graduated from Juilliard-- What's so remarkable about graduating from Juilliard? I booked a top hotel for you. - Is that okay? - Can I take my dog? Will you be sleeping with him? Not on my bed, but by my side. I doubt the hotel would permit that. I'd prefer staying in a house with a yard that's next to a park to walk my dog. Two bathrooms. One for me, one for Thoven. Don't even think of bathing Thoven in some plastic bathtub.

 Thoven is allergic to plastic. What about bed and breakfast? Do you work in a place where people barbecue and drink? - Sorry? - You're bad in Korean. It's an analogy. I can't concentrate in hectic places like bed and breakfasts. Sir, this way. This way, please. This is my friend's house. Stay here for a minute. I'll go ask the realtor down the street to find a place for you to stay. I'll be back. Why isn't he answering his phone? Where did he go? Sir. I'm told there's a huge villa over there. There's no yard, but it's quite big. - Open it. - Pardon? Why? Sure. Did he change the password? - What about personality? - Me? The owner of this house. Is he complicated? No, not really. You need to take off your shoes. Not bad. Oh, but the owner of this house... It's a pig pen, but the interior and furniture are nice. Get me my suitcase. But this house is already-- I'll put a grand piano there, so clear it out. Is the kitchen over here? It's dirty. Clean it. Where's the bathroom? Aren't you relying too much on your memory? - Write it down. - Someone's already living here! I'm disappointed. Didn't you say you knew the owner? Influence is key as a civil servant. How did you manage an orchestra without persuasion skills? Is something wrong with you? Kitchen and bathroom. Should I clean the entire house and make it simple? NO TRESPASSING! BEWARE OF DOG! Please try again. Hand on your head. Who are you? I'm the owner. Why? Who are you? Wait! Let's say classical music is blank. Fill in the blank for me. I don't think it's blank. You're the owner? She didn't contact you ahead of time. She's unreliable. Go to the second floor. You haven't aged in the past ten years. Do you know me? What do you think classical music is? I think it's bullshit. What? Gosh, Gun-woo! You've already met. I was going to introduce you. You saw his resume earlier. He's Kang Gun-woo. Right, Gun-woo? Introduce yourself. This is our conductor-- I know. The conductor. Get rid of him. Gosh, you're such a kidder. He didn't mean that. He mistook you for someone else. He's just sensitive about sharing his home with somebody else. Is that so? Then you'll have to live alone. Get out. Sorry? I can't share a house with a rude bastard like him. Kick him out. Sir, please open the door-- Hey! Everything worked out. He finally agreed. He'll let you use the second floor, but you have to be quiet. Wait. Is that not a good thing? Do you want to use my room? Let's swap for two months. I'll pay you rent! Is my room too small? Do you want to stay at an inn? If not, you can stay at a motel or hotel. Don't worry about the money. I can tap into my savings. Come here for a second. ABSOLUTE SILENCE He's a musician. Who are you calling? Hi, this is Gun-woo. There was a breaking and entering and trespassing. - Please send-- - Wait. There were no breaking and entering. Backup is not necessary. It's nothing! Do not come! Over! Hey! I know I'm pushing it. You helped me out as it is, and for me to ask you to share a house with him... I know I'm out of line. Fine. I'll do whatever it takes to find him another place. That's right. There was some scratchy noise while I was moving your stuff. Man, is my trumpet messed up? The movers weren't careful when moving your things. - If it's an instrument-- - Which box is it? Where is it? - Hey! - Gun-woo, I'm sorry. I know I'm being completely shameless, but I need to save myself. The house and trumpet... There aren't trumpeters. You know what I had to go through to find one. Yes. You said I was a bitch, right? You're right, a bitch. So please, Gun-woo, help me out with the house and trumpet. I'll count to three. Gun-woo, why are you such a jerk? - One. - What's so hard about sharing your house and playing the trumpet? You can pee and poop out there. Gun-woo, please. - Two. - Let's take revenge on the conductor after the concert is over. I'll do it for you. I'll perform the Chinese water torture and ask him what the blank is all night. So just for two months, please? No, a month. No, a week. Three! - Hey. - Three days. I give you three days to find a house and new trumpeter. - Really? - Until then... Fine, I'll endure it. Thanks. Gun-woo, thank you so much. - I'll never forget-- - I'll never help you again. Okay. Yes, sir. I'll hang the shower curtains right now. Gun-woo. You can do it! Thanks for coming, sir. I'm Du Ru-mi, the coordinator and concertmaster. Why are we practicing so late at night? Well, this is a project orchestra, so everyone does other jobs... Then is this a part-time gig? Oh, no. This is what they do full-time. They're still in the process of transferring... Let's start with woodwind. Lady, when did you last play? Me? - My name is Jung Hui-yeon. - Seems like more than 20 years ago. Why do you grab your bow so tight? Do you play the electric violin? Flute, how old are you? - I go to a music college. - You're at a high school level. Oboe. Did you keep exercising after you retired? - I go hiking for an hour-- - You need to breathe longer. Oboe has breathing intervals, but aren't you way out of breath? - And you. - What? Me? - Which cabaret do you work for? - Don't Tell Papa. Sir! What's going on? Well... The members aren't at their best because they're with other orchestras too-- Give me the honest truth. What's going on? You must have heard rumors about me. Did you hear I quit conducting while the President was attending the concert? That happened a long time ago. I'm 40 years old now. I get too tired to throw a tantrum like that. Don't do it. Let's sit down and talk. Come here. It must have been hard for you. Just tell me everything. I took a ten-hour plane ride here, I can't just leave empty-handed. Well... If I tell you, - will you conduct-- - If there's a valid reason, absolutely. Hey, Ru-mi! What's wrong with him? I don't get it. That's an act. Don't do it. Sir, well, the thing is... I was conned. Conned? What kind? Well... Her name was Ku Jeong-ae. Oh, Ku Jeong-ae? She's very famous. It must have been hard for you. Yes. We've already paid her, but the scandal surfaced afterward. The orchestra members all quit because we couldn't pay them. No, I can totally understand why they quit. The problem was that I was conned. Right. She's such a terrible person. How could she steal the performance fee? It's not that much money. We live on pride. She took advantage of innocent people. Right. So how did you get those people? Well... People wouldn't come for free in the beginning. So I opened it up to everyone regardless of experience, and that's when we got college students, a cabaret performer and people who haven't played for decades. We were horrible in the beginning, but we've come a long way. I'm leaving tomorrow. Buy my plane tickets. Pardon? Excuse me, sir. Why did you pretend to be nice when you were going to leave anyway? Pretend? There are many dimensions to a person's character. I just showed one aspect, that's all. And above all else, I'm not convinced. That's all! - If you were to hear me out-- - Forget it! A bastard like that can't create good music. - Come in. - Hey, wait. Let go of me. Don't you remember how terrible you were on the trumpet? You've never played in an orchestra, have you? It's ridiculous of you to lecture me about good music. Sir. Hey, what's the matter with you? I see. Can you ask your guest conductor? Please. Yes, thank you. Bye. What did he say? It will be tough. He's too busy with the Jeju Philharmonic Orchestra performances. Hey, do you know any conductors? What's wrong? Why did he piss the conductor off? You need to have self-control. It's a shock for him, too. He lost his house and got reported-- The things you do! Gosh. It must be nice being young. Are conductors that hard to come by? Don't worry. He's just upset. I should've listened to you and bluffed until the end. Hey. I have a friend who's in a marching band. Should I call him? No. You can tell just by seeing how somebody holds the baton. I also need to introduce him to the mayor. There's no way out of this. I'm completely trapped. I'll have to tell Mayor Kang the truth tomorrow. Will I get arrested? Will I go to prison? Well, it's a mistake you made at work, so no. Still, I'll have to pay the money back, right? It's the taxpayers' money. If I tap into all my savings, it'll be 20 million won. Seven million won for my car. This is about 30 million won, so... You're going to sell that? Of course, I need the money. Hey, pretty girl. Let's get a makeover today. I'll fit a new bridge, sand the fingerboard, and polish you up. What? Okay, fine. The pegbox. Was it tight? I'll use peg paste. I'll make you pretty, so you can meet a wonderful new owner. You need a chance to perform too. Don't you think? Gosh. I can't believe you want me to sell you off. I guess you didn't like me much. Let's perform. And make money. Are they going to play? - It looks like it. - I think they're playing. Really? How can I perform here? It's embarrassing. - Pretend it's the subway. - That was... Hurry up. Forget it! A bastard like that can't create good music. {\an8}See how good it is. It's enjoyable. Maestro, my butt. You pompous freak. You're so dead. Hey. I was very patient. I'll die either way anyway, from bursting from containing the rage or blowing up. I'm going to play the violin in the lawn all night, so he can't sleep. What the heck? Thoven, what did you eat? Hey, Thoven. Thoven, open your eyes! Open your eyes, Thoven! Thoven, open your eyes. Open your eyes, Thoven! Thoven. Thoven. Thoven! What was that? I need an ambulance. My dog is sick. He collapsed after taking sleeping pills. - You need to pump his stomach. - Don't make prank calls. Excuse me? It's not a prank call. My dog is really sick. Send an ambulance-- Hello? I thought you loved me. I never said that. Why do I have to sacrifice so many things in the name of music? Sir, are you okay? Sir, is something wrong? Sir. Do you have a car? Thoven, don't fall asleep or you'll die. - What happened to your dog? - I don't know. - Why did he eat the sleeping pills? - To commit suicide. He had no choice but to take his life. Look at his owner. Legs, Thoven's legs. I doubt any veterinary hospitals are open right now. Find one! Be it an ER or a university hospital. I need to save him. Okay, I'll be sure to look everywhere in the middle of the night. Thoven. Thoven. - What? - Don't fall asleep or you'll die. Don't just stand there! Let's go! Go ahead. Are you going to go to the ER? What is she doing? Where is she going? We have a veterinarian in our orchestra. Clarinetist Hong Jun-gi. That's great. Why did she go alone? Conduct for us. You don't want to? Hey, come back. Do you think this will make me conduct well? I'll give you 15 minutes. What did Gun-woo mean by not treating the dog? Nothing. Don't worry about it. This is the only thing you can think of? I thought about conducting as a form of gratitude if you took care of my dog. But... Gun-woo, it's me. He's getting his stomach pumped. - He'll be okay. - What? He's about to die? Okay. You have ten seconds left. My dog is big. It'll be difficult to bury it. Even if you sell it, who would want meat of a dog that overdosed? Time's up. Summer is long gone. Who-- Hey, kill it. Fine, I'll do it! I'll write up the content of the contract later. Just sign it. I just can't trust you. Thoven. Where's my Thoven? Thoven. Thoven... Thoven. Thoven, my boy. You made it. Let me take a look at your face. Are you okay? You did well. You made it. Thoven. I'm so glad you made it. Thoven. You made it. I have no recollection. CONTRACT It's a piece of paper. What about it? Okay, I'll do it! Just save my Thoven and I'll conduct for you! - Who's that? - You're pathetic. Pathetic? The most pathetic thing for me to do in life is conduct a trashy orchestra. It's tarnishing classical music. On top of that, you threatened me using Thoven who's like family to me. I won't ever forgive you. I don't care. Just conduct. What? Gun-woo! Not you, sir, him. Keep quiet. Sir, I'm sorry. You do know Thoven was already receiving treatment, right? Who came up with the plot? You or him? Who's the brains behind it? It was me. I'm the concertmaster. I did it. You already received the signing bonus and I got you a place to stay, but you refused to conduct for us, so I came up with the plan. I'm sorry. Even if you refused, you know we would've saved Thoven. So if you would be kind enough to help us out-- I can't drive. - Sorry? - I need a driver. And a maid who cooks and cleans. I can definitely do that for you! Someone needs to walk, bathe and feed Thoven, do the laundry, organize things, and run errands. - I'll do everything! - Man! What are you doing? You said to work. - Are you two going out? - No, we're not. You guys take the blame for each other and you help each other. It's beautiful. But this is work. I got how young and immature you are, so get a room and show off your love elsewhere! What else do you need besides dog food and water? The issue at hand is who will take responsibility-- Gosh, you never stop talking. What else do you want me to do? Give me a list of things. Sir, be patient. You must do it on your own. No help from your fairy godmother. Okay. - You're dead. - What? When did he want you to finish cutting the grass? Two o'clock. Just mow the lawn. He said to do it by hand. It will take forever to organize his stuff. Can we finish everything before the rehearsal? Were you able to sleep? Why did you help me? He's mean, but he's older than me. - I was out of line to threaten him. - No, I mean me. You said you'd never help me. But you rented me the house, stopped the conductor from leaving, helped me with chores. And then you're playing the trumpet. You're going to keep playing, right? You're not going to leave, right? - Hey. - Yes? If you don't have anything to do, cut the grass over there. I wonder why you're helping me. It's putting me in a good mood. Why did you help me? Why did you help me? - Why did you help me? - Hey! - It's cold! Stop it. - Why did you help me? I was going to wash these anyway. I'll do it now since my clothes are dirty. I was going to wash them. Gosh, it feels good! You should go now. After I finish with the dishes. Sir. I wasn't helping. I just did the laundry. No, I didn't even do the laundry. I didn't help him one bit. Do it all on your own. I-deun, the reason I wanted to see you... Don't come closer. Talk from there. I'm not insane. I don't care. I'm going to tell. It gives me the creeps to be sitting next to a nutcase! I have dementia. No, not yet. Insanity and dementia, same thing. Two weeks ago, I went to the hospital because I wasn't feeling well. The doctor said I had a couple of strokes that I didn't even know about. I thought I dozed off for a second, but I had brain damage, so the possibility of me getting dementia is high. I think it already hit you. I was mistaken about the milk. I was anxious about getting dementia. I got nervous. But one thing's for sure, I don't have dementia now. - Not yet. - See? You already have it! I can prevent myself from getting it if I make an effort. If I exercise, move my fingers, play the oboe, and use my brain to do things. I'm going to tell. I don't like it! Hey. Hey, I-deun, wait! Isn't it difficult to juggle working and studying? I'll give you some money to buy books. This will only buy me one book. What can I do with 10,000 won? Really? Here's 20,000 won. Buy a couple of books. Take care of yourself. Losing your mind when you're old is the saddest thing in the world. Right, okay. Thanks. What are you doing over there? Hurry, the conductor's coming. Do you remember what I told you, everyone? Don't take Mr. Kang's words personally, and be sure to smile, okay? You look nice today. I dressed up to look good for you. He's going to criticize you soon after. That's his style. Don't let him get to you. You look sharp yourself. I'm here with an open mind. Your musical abilities aren't up to par, but I praise your passion for music. Yes, classical music needs to be enjoyed within our daily lives. Let's start with the first piece. Let's have fun. Great. Do you get the beat? Let's try one more time. Mr. Kang. Mr. Kang. Mr. Kang. Oh my, what time is it? It's 9:55 p.m. I'm sorry. I have to run. How can you leave when you were the last one to get here, lady? I have to make snacks for my husband at ten. Why do you keep calling me lady? - Call me Hui-yeon. - Hui-yeon can leave. For the rest of you, let's practice until 10:30 p.m. If I practice 30 minutes more, are you going to pay me overtime? How can you say that after texting throughout the rehearsal? Mr. Bae. Why do you keep pissing me off? You're not the concertmaster! You're unbelievable. Who cares if I text while practicing? - Hey, everyone. - Hang on. The reason for the confusion is because we don't have a set of rules in place. - Why don't we select a leader-- - We have a concertmaster. Mr. Bae, why don't you be quiet! A leader's different from the concertmaster. Ms. Du is our concertmaster, which focuses on musical elements-- - I'm off! - You can't leave! Go blow in the back! Gosh! So... The leader should be in charge of strengthening our teamwork. Ten o'clock! - Sit down! - No! Sit down. Blow outside! The cacophony of those sounds was wonderful. That fits your level. Continue on. It's very good. Mr. Kang. Sir. Sir. Sir, I'm sorry. People will calm down... Why don't you change the piece? Like Beethoven's "Wellington's Victory." It'll be perfect with the sound of canons. I know it annoys you. I'm annoyed, too. - But-- - Let him go. They're improving little by little. Let's do it on our own. I suppose as long as you get the job done. The question is, will you? A conductor only waves his arms in the air anyway. Just put him on the podium the day of the concert and forget about him. They say ignorance is bliss. - Conducting is-- - Hurry, come in. Where are you going, Hui-yeon? Why don't we practice a little longer? - Are you okay? - Yes. - Are you hurt? - No. - I have to go. - Go take your seat. Go home if you're going to text. Why? I'm supposed to get 180,000 won. You wanted to choose a leader, right? Any volunteers? Okay, applause! - Then let's-- - Hey. Are you the concertmaster? Why are you in the front? I'm only regulating. Would you like to do it? Just regulate. - Okay. - Here. Okay, then... Let's take it again from where the strings come in. Let's go! Wait! Hey. Don't you think we're off pitch? They're even off pitch. What could I possibly do? - We tuned our instruments earlier. - Precisely. They have the confidence and courage to play even when they're slightly off. It's great. Which instrument was off pitch? It's okay. You guys can't even tell. I'll still try. Can you distinguish these two sounds? Right, just think of it as the sound of a snack. It'll be easier. Don't you think the orchestra members are dedicated? They're all here to practice even though they have-- Practice. Who's stopping them? Just play at home, not on stage. If not, play at a playground or by the river. Consider yourselves as an outdoor band. Why do you want to perform at a huge venue? That's vanity. Yes, I know. But the circumstances... We were given an opportunity. - To throw that away-- - No, they can throw it away. They need to have the courage to know their abilities and accept it. "I'm of humble birth. I have no right to play classical music. I only belong in the audience. I should go to concerts and listen to famous people perform." There are many great musicians out there. Leave it to them. They need to make dinner for the husband, go to work and make money. Why bother when they don't even have the time? Classical music is for aristocrats. The times have changed, but the essence doesn't. Answer your phone. Hello? I'm calling from Mirae Fund. I'd like to give you some investment advice. What, you son of a bitch? Why would you tell me that? How dare you give me crap, saying it's advice? Shut up, asshole! I make the decision to buy or not! The times have changed, but the essence doesn't! Yes, we don't have the time or money. We're sad incompetent souls. That doesn't mean we need to kill ourselves! Who said commoners can't play music? Is it against the law? Humble birth? Aristocrats? Are you still living in the Joseon Dynasty, asshole? - I know they hung up. - What is it to you if they hung up? Did you know Mozart was a commoner, you jerk? According to your theory, Mozart should've milked cows and sold cheese all his life! If you were a conductor back then, you would've destroyed many great talents! You're like Salieri! Your name is Du Ru-mi? Your parents named you wrong. Durumi means crane, but you're like a chicken. A feisty chicken. I like how you are straightforward. It's much better than talking behind my back. I see. Yes, Mozart was a commoner. That's true. Yes, and he was a genius. Yes, a genius. That's why I hate Mozart. Not all commoners are alike. There are commoners who can determine accurate pitch and there are commoners who can't even tune their instrument. Tune them again. Let's start with woodwind. Thoven, I'm letting you in on a secret. I don't know which instrument is out of tune. I just know it's slightly off. What? You know? Of course, you're a dog. You can hear better. My Thoven should lead this orchestra. Don't you agree? Is something wrong? - How did you do it? - Sorry? You're in tune. What did you do? I turned on the air-conditioning. The wind instruments' pitch got higher because it was hot in here. I lowered it by turning on the air-conditioning. How? How did you know how high it went for you to adjust it? I could just tell it was off by 1/8, which required this much adjustment. Hey, apologize, man. Go on. No, let him be. I could just tell it was off by 1/8, which required this much adjustment. Can't you just tell it was 1/8 degrees off which is about this much? Hey, Gun-woo. It's about 1/4 degree off, so this much. How did you play an off-tuned piano? Stop shooting. Make up an excuse for me in exchange for tuning the piano. I'm going to go out and have fun. - Hey, let's go. - Okay. Gun-woo. Why do you practice like there's no tomorrow? That's so dumb. Enjoy yourself. It's a song, music. I'll announce the grand prize. The winner is... Kang Gun-woo. It's amazing. We have two grand prizes this year. Jung Myeong-hwan. Come in! What happened? Why is Myeong-hwan conducting our graduation performance? Well, Gun-woo. He started to learn how to conduct after me. He picked it up because he thought I looked cool. He switched to conducting without much thought. This is a school. Please lower your voice. I heard I had the highest score two days ago! What happened all of a sudden? I'm the one who's supposed to conduct the graduation performance! - I don't understand. - It's because of your attitude. If you were pleasant to your professors and if you were social, this wouldn't have happened. You were only off by a point. After receiving the Bruno Walter Emerging Conductor Award, gifted conductor-- Jung Myeong-hwan conducted the Dresden Philharmonic and Vienna Philharmonic. He conducts famous European orchestras and has received worldwide reputation. Gifted conductor from Korea-- World-famous conductor Jung Myeong-hwan will be honored with the Golden Crown Order of Merit-- I could just tell it was off by 1/8, which required this much adjustment. Water. Gosh, it's in the fridge. Where's the water? Spring water! I stocked it in the fridge. Don't act cocky. If you're from a humble birth, you need to bow down! What the hell is he saying? {\an8}SEOKRAN MAYOR KANG CHUN-BAE {\an8}Mayor Kang? Hi, Mr. Kang. I should've gone to greet you first, but I heard you were still practicing. It's nice to meet you. Please have a seat. Please get us tea. It's a bit messy, isn't it? I have a lot of work. I keep on getting more work to do. As mayor, I should be more organized, but the work keeps piling up. The city of music... What do you think? Doesn't it fit our city's image? A pastoral symphony fits perfectly given all the farms. A pastoral symphony? I know that piece. It's wonderful. That's a drama theme song. Are they different? - It's a joke. - What did you want to say? Right, through this concert, I have high hopes of developing Seokran into a city of music. Why a city of music? I heard the government plans on selecting a cultural zone. And Seokran is one of the candidates. That's not the only reason-- You need something unique to be designated as a cultural zone. Busan is for movies, Gangwon is for plays, Bucheon is for animation. That's right, but no city claimed music yet-- - You don't need to spend money. - Is that true? Instead, you'll need something more. - Time. - Oh, time. It's okay. I have plenty of time. Take your time filling me in on your opinion of how to make Seokran into a city of music. But first, please take a look at this. This is the list of guests I've invited to the performance. It's best that you don't invite them because the performance won't be that great. Why are you being so modest? I know you're very talented. Didn't you perform for the President? I'm glad you mentioned it. That was actually-- That's why I invited someone of your caliber as an esteemed guest. This person. Him. I don't know how he knew about it, but he arrived in Korea just in time for the concert. Actually, he's here to receive an award. My former political leader's in-law's uncle knows Jung Myeong-hwan. That's how I was able to invite him. He promised to come. Aren't you good childhood friends? Aren't you happy to meet again as conductor and audience? You didn't get a conducting job yet? Want me to hook you up? I'm sorry. We decided to hire Mr. Jung Myeong-hwan as the conductor instead of you. How much did you weigh before? Ninety-three kilograms? What are you doing? Let's practice! Do you know who Helen Keller is? She was blind and deaf, but she overcame her disabilities to graduate from college and become a miracle social activist. Let's do that. Let's make a miracle. I'll be your Anne Sullivan! What's with that look? Do you think you're better than that? At least Helen Keller was smart and received support from her family. You don't have money, talent, experience or flexibility. To pull off a performance in 20 days is a miracle, isn't it? Try to be like Helen Keller. Close your mouth and eyes, and open your ears. Only pay attention to the music and my voice. I'll make you at least say "water." I don't know if it'll be water, bean paste or dung, but... Let's begin. Oboe. That's not it. Again. Throw your breath more. Again. Expand your diaphragm and tighten your stomach muscles! Did you run up the stairs? Do you smoke? Again! That's not it! He's criticizing Mr. Kim who played the oboe for more than 30 years. What's going to happen to us? Should we quit? Let's skip the oboe part and go with the strings. What's wrong? Tell us what you didn't like about the oboe performance. Shut your mouth. Play for me, lady. Did you really graduate from music school? Yes. Then what's the problem? I haven't played in a long time. Do you know you're just a nuisance? Didn't you want people to call you Hui-yeon? Do you know what that means? You need to own up to your name. Do you think you own up to your name? I'd be too afraid to say my name with talent like that. You're one brave woman. You don't practice, your pitch is off, but you're cocky about attending music school, so you'll only perform in an orchestra. You're so selfish. Tell us what we're doing wrong, so we can fix it! Gun-woo, be quiet. I'm sorry. I have ways to go. Do you want me to cut you some slack? Do you know what they call people like you? Incorrigible, nuisance, obstacle, and the list goes on. There's one thing I want to call you. C-R-A-P. Why, that son of a... Shall we recognize your lack of talent? Repeat after me. C-R-A-P. Why are you suddenly being like this? You don't want to practice? You're not going to perform? They're all good people. Even though they're not getting paid, they're here in hopes to perform. Must you treat them like morons? Jung Myeong-hwan is coming. He's the one who always hindered me from my goals. Anyhow, I'll have to conduct those people in front of him. Do you think that makes sense? You can teach us nicely. Don't you know a carrot works better than a whip? I don't know! I'm not even pleased with professionals. If I don't hear the sound I want, I hold auditions and fire existing members. I keep changing the first and second performers until I'm satisfied. But I have to go on stage with those people out there. Does that make sense? Isn't a successful performance a fun one? - If you create fear-- - Listen to me! I have to perform with that trash in front of a jerk who became the best conductor on a whim! All because of you! Are you drunk? Would it be okay to hear something important? What is it? How can you not even play a note accurately? By someone with your style, do you mean an orchestra killer? You're saying Jung Myeong-hwan can make an outstanding brew using this. Look forward to the concert. You have to do something. I'll just keep it as a dream. I'm not telling you to realize your dream. At least dream of realizing it. So... I need you. Me too. I'll show you some of my magic. I'll show it to you myself, not my replacement. The important thing is what you want to convey to the audience. The emotions. Maestro Kang, you're the best! This is it for me. Hope you do well on your own. Subtitle translation by Jeong Lee
