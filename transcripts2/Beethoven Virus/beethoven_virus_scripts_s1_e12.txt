 {\an8}You're just going to head back? {\an8}Since you came all the way, let's eat-- How did you make the coffee? Pardon? {\an8}You know, the espresso you make me every morning. What's the coffee and water ratio? I came to ask you that. Really? You came all the way here because of coffee and-- Once you get used to a certain taste, it's hard to change your preference. You get addicted. Forget it if you don't want to tell me.

 No, I'll tell you. But can we grab something to eat before we go? I haven't had lunch, so I'm starved. Eat at the station. We don't have time. Aren't you going to perform? Perform? You really didn't call anyone else besides me? You don't know what's going on? They were all fired? It's only temporary. If they get good evaluations at the festival, they can come back. It all happened because of me. Everyone got mixed in because of me. Yes, it's because of you.

 Why did you get conned? Why did you gather people? Why did you submit the proposal? Why did you go to music school? Why did you start playing the violin? Why were you born? Why did your parents give birth to you? Why did your parents meet? Your parents' parents? Your parents' parents' parents? Do you want me to continue? The ancient kings are to blame. Without them, you wouldn't exist or that con artist, for that matter. Those bad kings. If you have time to regret, you should practice. That's how you get revenge on those jerks who looked down on you. Okay. Take out your violin. Here? Why? Are you embarrassed? How did you perform if you're scared of a small crowd like this? Take it out. But still. Skip one day of practice, and you know. Two days, and the audience knows. Three, and a dog walking by knows. But how many days did you skip? Take it out now! What is that? It's terrible because you haven't played in so long! Can't you play the notes right? Where did all your calluses go? Vibrato. Why's your bow floating around? Keep it close to the strings! Loosen your hand and use your arms! KANG GUN-WOO Oh, I'm sorry. Lean on me. Your head, I mean. It must be light because it's empty. Lean on me. No, it's okay. Are you saying the window is stronger than I am? Lean on me. {\an8}PUPIL Yeah. Where are you, sir? I went to buy coffee. Did you eat? I'll be home soon. First violin, second violin, viola, cello, contrabass, and then... Yong-gi's here. Let's see. The tympani will go here. And this is me. When did you get here? What are you doing? I'm practicing conducting. Is that what you call conducting? Not ballet? I dance according to the beat. I'm planning on narrowing down-- Why are you dancing like a fool and not doing what I taught you? Come down. This is a more comfort-- Your hand should jerk like you touched something hot. Like this? I saw Ru-mi. I see. Is she back from her trip? No, I went to her. I went to go ask what the ratio for this was. She's going to practice with you guys starting tomorrow. I see. Is that it? Didn't you go because of the coffee? Are you stupid? Did you believe that? Mr. Kang, there are many girls in this world. Of course, there are many guys and many teachers. But the real deals are hard to come by. I choose you over Ru-mi, so don't worry about me. Are you really okay? Then should I cry? You're too nonchalant about it. Because I'm nice. I'm not a twisted person like you. I'm a really cool guy. Don't you think I'm doing well? You're doing well. Way too well. Okay, I'm going to take this mood all the way up to the concert. Cello. Cello... Ru-mi! Long time no see. When did you get back from your trip? Yesterday. It's so good to see you. I'm glad you're back. Hello, Hui-yeon. You decorated the practice studio. It must've been tough. Gun-woo did it all. I see. I unclogged the toilet. You can use the restroom now. Hey there. Can you hand me the bulb? Ru-mi. How did you put up a light way up there? That must have been hard. Shall I hold it steady? No. It's dangerous. I'll hold it steady. Go get ready to practice. Gun-woo, what's going on? The orchestra festival said no. They said we can't even enter. I called them, and they said we can't participate. Not qualified, they said. This must be the office. ORCHESTRA COMMITTEE I'm here to enter the orchestra festival. I'll call you back. What's the name of your orchestra? Name... Well... Mouse Philharmonic. Never heard of it. When were you formed? Last week. Did you perform? We're planning to this time... Are you kidding me? Look here. These are the teams that are confirmed to perform. Only the best can perform. Seokran Philharmonic. We're original members of the Seokran Philharmonic. Don't you know the famous conductor, Kang Gun-woo? He personally-- Forget about Maestro Kang. - Do you have a preliminary round? - This isn't a competition. It's like a concert for the public by the best orchestras. Maestro Kang intended to screw us over. Shit. We need to perform. Is there a way? There's a small outdoor concert hall. But they're fully booked with vendors and play performances. There aren't any openings. If you want to try to squeeze your way in, bring me a recorded performance. Make a demo tape. There will be a farmers market. How can we perform where people are eating-- You know where the New York Philharmonic performs every summer? They perform at Central Park where people lay down and have picnics. We're not the New York Philharmonic, and this is an important concert for us. Critics will be busy watching the main performances. Who would come-- If the flower is good, a butterfly will fly miles to find it. You have to make them come with your abilities. But this is too hard. Do you want something easy? Then don't perform. Instead, collect ten million won. With that money, you can bribe the critics and wine and dine them. While hanging out with them, beg them to write you a good review. Although I doubt they would. You won't accept us then. Absolutely! I'll do it with my abilities. I'm not done yet. Which score are you performing? Tell me what you're considering. First, Tchaikovsky's "1812 Overture." You'll have to ring bells and blow canons. How are you going to do that? No. Next. The second is the sixth movement of Mahler's "Symphony No. 3." Out of your league right now. Maybe when you're 60. Next. Stravinsky's "The Rite of Spring." That's modern music. You need to go with the basics! Why... Go with this. It's Beethoven's "Piano Concerto No. 5 'Emperor.'" Concerto? Why this... We don't have a pianist. That's why I want you to do it. You can't do it alone. You need help from a soloist. I still want to do it by myself. Do you think Mozart was once a police officer? Do you think he did traffic control until he was 25, and suddenly one day started busting out good scores? Mozart received training. He was taught how to conduct from the age of five and trained heavily. What about you? You just started learning how to conduct. You think you can catch up to those people who have done music for years? Okay. I'll listen and interpret it. I'll tell you tomorrow. No need for interpretation. I've already written it down. Just do exactly what it says. No need for interpretation. I've already written it down. Just do exactly what it says. - Yes? - Mr. Kim Gap-yong won't play, right? - I'm contemplating. - Are you Hamlet? While you're thinking, Ophelia and you will die, and the performance will bomb. What did I say you lack? Didn't I say it was determination? Become a bit tougher. Forget it. Before you leave, take my card. Sorry? You'll need money to prepare for this and that. Use my credit card. You said not to take the easy way. I never said to starve yourself! Would you take it if you were me? I'll keep my pride even if I have to starve. I thought of a way. I'll handle it. - Be careful. - The leg may break. Watch out for the step. - Okay. - Good. - Turn it. - Turn. Push it over here. Wait, should we... Move this further... - Move it to the left. - We moved it too much. - Push it back? - Yes. Okay. - Thanks. - Thanks. - Here. - Have some gimbap. Here's milk. - And bread. - You should've bought ramen. - I don't have money. - Sorry. - No rice wine? - Shake it before drinking it. - Rice wine? - We did physical labor. - Doesn't it look nice now? - Just drink this. - It's dirty. - It stinks. Do you know what I did to get this place? That's good. Thanks for coming. I don't have anything to give you... but gimbap. Thank you. Enjoy. - Oh, no. - It's okay. You did well. - Didn't Kim Jin-ju do well? - Yes, she did. - Let's go. - Goodbye. Not even her? She's the best pianist at my school. Well, how should I say this... You're too picky. I don't have anyone else. Those were all my friends from school. Me neither. Why are you being so nitpicky? Are you really trying to depend on the soloist? It's not that. I really wasn't feeling it. Everyone plays according to the music. But... they're missing soul. And the students need more practice. Soul. Finally, he mentioned soul. Gun-woo's about to ascend into the world of art. You're giving me goose bumps. Hey. Are you looking for a piano soloist? You must be here because of the listing online. - Nice to meet you. I'm Kang Gun-woo. - Hello. I'm Seo Yeol. I run a local piano school. I see. Would you please play for us? Sure. - Can I loosen my fingers? - Sure. - Okay, I'm done. Shall I start? - Sure. How... How could you play so dynamically... She's got soul all right. Did I pass? - Yes. - Yes. Absolutely! You're amazing. Ma'am, you... You're so powerful and wonderful. But can you loosen up when you play? Beethoven was a classical music composer, so I interpreted this score to be precise and accurate. This is a classical music score, but I thought it would be good to play it in a romantic way. Okay, I'll think of it in a more romantic manner. You look like pianist Seo Hae-kyeong. - I get that a lot. - Right? - You look so much like her. - Hyeok-gwon. Why would Ms. Seo Hae-kyeong come here? Would you please play it in a slightly romantic manner? Sure. Kang Gun-woo is pretty good. He's young, and he has a good ear. I like the way he interprets music. He's very dedicated and unique. He's my pupil. Look at you, all proud. - Don't you like him a little too much? - You can stomp all over him. You may relieve all the grudges you have against me on him. I'll have to increase the frequency. Meeting up once a week won't be enough. By the way, please keep this a secret. He's pretty stubborn, so if he finds out I referred you, he won't do it. Sure thing. Don't worry. - Bye. - See you. We have practice at 10 p.m. Don't be late. - Okay. - Thank you. - Bye. - Bye. I think the first note for the brass is a bit strong. What do you think? That's what we were discussing. - Ru-mi! - Ru-mi! Come here. When are you free in the evening? We're going to do a part-time gig. Gun-woo was going to pay for renting this place and the piano. But we can't let him do that. Definitely. I'll join you. Where is it going to be at? It'll be at a restaurant Mr. Bae knows, but the pay isn't that great. It's better to play at weddings. - Wedding? - No, we shouldn't. Money isn't the objective. We need time to practice. The timpanist is so lucky. They get 10,000 won per beat. Whereas we get like ten won for every stroke. Brass is going to offer private lessons. What about the woodwind section? Mr. Kim Gap-yong isn't going to do it? Must you make an old man work? He has a cold and isn't feeling well. Can't you tell he didn't make it to practice today? Let's get the strings together. I'm down. I can do whenever. Can you play today? I have plans today. I can start tomorrow. I'll leave my calendar open. Okay, you're playing full time starting from tomorrow. - All right. - Go. Don't you have plans? I'll see you later. I think... - Can you watch out for that? - Sure. These are the books you wanted. Mr. Kang, I haven't seen you in a week. Are you just going to read? I don't have much time either. - I have practice at night-- - I'm busy too. I don't even have time to interpret music. We met even though we're busy, - so we should enjoy-- - Enjoy what? Do you want me to play with you? You should study. You need to be efficient with your time. You were confused just now, right? What are you talking about? You don't know what to do because it's awkward and embarrassing, right? See? You haven't flipped a single page yet. I was about to flip it. This book is a bit difficult. You're so cute. Let's go. I'll entertain you. - I need to interpret-- - Just for ten minutes. Please? Let's go out for a walk. Isn't it nice? Don't you feel refreshed? Don't you know there was an ozone warning today? I can't breathe. Let's go back. Just for ten minutes. You can go back. I'm going to stay here for a while... Aren't you going to head back? I can do whatever I want. Aren't you busy interpreting a score? I'm doing it in my head. Hi. These are our performers for today. - Hello. - It's a pleasure to meet you. Don't they look nice? These two women are pretty. They're great, so you should pay us more. They all played for the city orchestra. - Nice to meet you. - Hi. What's a city orchestra? It's short for the municipal philharmonic orchestra. It's like the Berlin Philharmonic, New York Philharmonic, and London Philharmonic. We're the Seokran Philharmonic. Say hello. This is Kang Gun-woo, the conductor. - It's a pleasure to meet you. - Likewise. A string quartet is supposed to have a viola, but the contrabassist is filling in for today. Viola is good to hear when it's raining. A big violin like that is much better for a place this big. Have you seen a big instrument like that before? No, right? That one instrument can replace ten violins. Didn't you want your son to learn how to play an instrument? Mr. Kang Gun-woo is a really good trumpet player. Private lessons. - My son is now four. - That's late. You need to start young for wind instruments. And I'm promoting your place like crazy. I told Mr. Kim at City Hall, so upper-level executives will come. The Mayor, Vice Mayor, Chief Director... You'll have to expand. Maybe open up a franchise. Let's go over there to discuss the private lessons - in detail. - Wait. How much do you want to pay for the lessons? He's four? How is 400,000 won per lesson? He doesn't give lessons for less than 300,000 won. We're brothers. We're blood-related. Left turn. Aren't you going to the practice studio? Aren't you going to eat? Mr. Kim said he made reservations. How can we eat at a place like this? Go ahead. I'll go to the ladies room. Please follow me. It's good for his future. I'm starved. Be patient. We're almost done. Gosh. Wouldn't it be good for both of you? Sir. Aren't you going to sit? It's Ru-mi. Ru-mi. Let's go, Mr. Kang. What are those people doing over there? Why are they selling music? Let's go, Mr. Kang. I'll have to listen to how well they play. What's going on with those two, man? Why did she come with Maestro Kang? Are they going out? What's going on with those two? They look serious. This isn't right. Let's continue. Set A. When did they start? You knew they were doing that, right? Why didn't you tell me? Who are those people? Do you not like their performance? We've never had classical music performers before. Mr. Kang. Mr. Kang. Mr. Kang. Would you tell me what's wrong? The performance is horrible. What's with the string quartet? Where did the viola go? Why is the contrabass here? Mr. Kang, I referred them here to play part-time. The viola wasn't appropriate with the weather... I mean since we're at a restaurant, it can be more carefree. You can ignore the rules at a restaurant? Can music change depending on the location? Since when were you so arrogant? How much are you getting paid? That's none of your business. Hyeok-gwon. You're not going to participate in the orchestra festival? You're not going to join the city orchestra? You don't have enough time to practice, but you're doing this? How can I... I told them to do it, sir. Didn't you come here to eat? Finish eating. Is this your way? You refused to receive the money I gave you, and the best thing you thought of was this? Money? What money? It's not Gun-woo's fault. We decided to divide into groups and-- How can you exploit your orchestra members to make money? Are you a pimp? Excuse me, sir. Thanks for the performance. Keep this up. Mr. Kang. Mr. Kang. This is so much. I dropped one. It fell in. - It was a 100,000-won bill. - Get out! Hey. - Get them out of here! - Sir. Bro! Bro, this isn't right. Come here. What's going on? Go. Boys should go. She came with Maestro Kang. It looked like they were going out. Then Ru-mi... Yes. She left Gun-woo for Maestro Kang. Ju-hui. Is it that amusing? Should I get you a mic? I'm not the only one gossiping. How could she do that? What about Gun-woo? - Poor Gun-woo. - My goodness. Why didn't you take the money? Maestro Kang offered it to you. If we keep receiving help from him-- Then what? Will the sheet music fly away? Will the music get twisted? No, it won't. Who fired us? It's Maestro Kang. If I were you, I'd steal his wallet-- I think there's a misunderstanding. Mr. Kang isn't the one who fired us. - It may seem like that but-- - I know! I know that he was protecting us and stuff... Yes, I know. But it's just money. Don't you need money? I need money to put food on the table. I got fired from all my private lessons, but my wife thinks I'm still in the city orchestra. If I want to keep up the facade, I have to give her a paycheck in two days. Stop it already. Do you know how long it's been since you lectured him? We haven't started practice yet. Come on. Let's go in. Why are you letting your anger out on him for getting fired? - I didn't let my anger out on him. - Go on. - Hurry up and go in. - Gosh. Why did you do that? Gun-woo's acting weird. - He's doing his best. - Is that the best? He refused the money I gave him, and he's working to make money. Can't you tell he's pretending to be polite, but he's rebelling? Can't you see how much he's enduring? That's why I'm saying that it's odd! He tolerates when he should burst, is stubborn when he should be tolerant. Must everyone act the way you think they should? Gun-woo even called me. He's the one who said things were hard for you and to take care of you. Gun-woo called you? Personally? Yes. How do you think he felt? He sincerely admires you, so for you-- Everything's clear now. Everything makes sense. For me? It's not like we're father and son. How can a human being be so altruistic? He let his girlfriend go and was publicly humiliated, but he called you to take care of me? Who in their right mind would do that? - Because it's Gun-woo. - You know nothing about guys. Do you think a guy's ego is that insignificant? I got it, so you may leave. What? Did you know? - About? - About Ru-mi and Maestro Kang dating. I hooked them up. I didn't know Ru-mi was so conniving. How could she... I wasn't in a deep relationship with her. - We were friends and-- - Hey. Do you know what people are saying behind your back? She embarrassed you by crying when you gave her the flower last time. And now what? Maestro Kang? Aunt. Gosh. Hey there. Come in. - Is it true? - Yes. No way. That's so messed up. It's absurd. Ru-mi, are you going out with Maestro Kang? Hey. Hey. What do you mean going out? I-deun, you're not only disrespectful, but you're presumptuous. Going out? Absurd. Can't she have dinner with Mr. Kang? A guy and a girl can eat together. They can miss each other, want to hold hands... - Seriously. - Hey. Sit down. Ru-mi. - What's going on? - Come on, lady. Hui-yeon, you can ask her later. Yes. It's uncomfortable for me to ask you in front of Gun-woo. I really adored you. It's just that I don't want to talk behind your back. Tell us what's going on. I tend to like conductors. That's why I went after him. Honestly, he's amazing. He's talented and has charisma. Besides, a lot more people know who he is. A lot more? Yes. - A lot more than Gun-woo. - Hey, how can you... Gun-woo, you know she's deliberately being like that, right? No, Hyeok-gwon. That's what I really think. Sorry, Gun-woo. I played you a little. Sit. Let's practice. Let's have fun practicing and pull off an amazing show. - Okay? - Okay, sounds good. Your practice ended early today. The troublemakers are gone. That's right. You must be happy. Why is he here... What can I do for you? Let me ask you a question. Where is the orchestra practice studio? Pardon? What are you talking about... Which orchestra are you referring to? The Seoul Philharmonic. The conductor is Jung Je-dong. Sorry? I keep hearing a weird noise from somewhere. - Yes? - Where are you, Grandpa? You didn't answer your home phone. Are you on your way to practice? You're not even answering me. Are you that sick? Why are you being stubborn and you refuse to go to the hospital? You won't let me visit you at home. I'm worried because I haven't seen you for a week. Let's go to-- Hello? Grandpa? Grandpa! Where are we going? You were looking for the Seoul Philharmonic. We're going to its practice studio. Oh, I see. It's really late. After practice, I'll be arrested for violating curfew. They'll take you home by car after the practice. Is that so? The President passed away not too long ago, so things are a bit chaotic and tension must be high. Man. Please come out. What's this smell? It looks like a pig pen. It suits them perfectly. This way. Come this way. What terrible conducting skills. Mr. Kim. Are you okay? Mr. Kim, are you sick? How are you together? Do you know me? Sorry? Mr. Kim. I'm Yong-gi from Bulkwang. I think there must be a mistake. The Seoul Philharmonic never practiced in a shabby place like this. I've never seen them before... Weren't you at home because you had a cold? There were some changes. Some members have changed a bit, but they're all talented, so you won't have any problems. - I see. - And the practice studio is currently under construction. This is only temporary. Is that so? Gosh. I look forward to working with you. I'm Kim Gap-yong. Yes. Nice to meet you, sir. I'm the new conductor, Kang Gun-woo. This is the vice conductor of the Seoul Philharmonic. He may be young, but he graduated from Juilliard. He's very talented. I see. I look forward to working with you. When did you come, Grandpa? Did you just arrive? I was worried about you, so I swung by your house. Yeong-ju, what are you doing here? Not again. Who in the heck is Yeong-ju? Yeong-ju, come here for a second. Come here. - Let go. What are you doing? - Come on. - Let go! Grandpa! - Take her away! Why are you playing along? I-deun. Aren't you supposed to help him if he can't snap out of it? But what's wrong with everybody? Why are you acting? Mr. Kim has dementia. Right now, this is reality for him. - He was fine three days ago! - But it's gotten to him now! How do you know? He came back last time after a short-- That was temporary. It'll only become worse! There isn't a way. Then there's only one solution. Playing along. We need to make him feel comfortable. Don't you agree? So... You want me to act like I'm someone else? Let him just forget who I am? I was so close to him... You want me to let him just forget who I am? I really don't know what's going on. It's okay. Didn't you say you had a cold? Doesn't life look somewhat different after you've been very sick? You'll get accustomed in no time. I see. That's true but... Things are a bit rowdy today. Why don't you rest at home and come back... Sure. Sir, why don't you do that? Let's go. Sir, this way. Sir. Sir, this way. - Are you taking him home? - Yes. Sir, come this way. Take him home safely. - Act appropriately. - Let's go. Hurry. - Hey, hop in. - Hurry. Don't cry. Are they taking Mr. Kim home? - Yes, they just left. - Gun-woo. Didn't Mr. Kim say his children live in Japan? - I think it's best to contact them-- - Yong-gi will take care of it. He's going to look for their number at Mr. Kim's home. Aren't you going to practice? Aren't you going home? How can I go home without a car? Didn't you see him leave with my car? You can take a taxi. I can't take a taxi because I only have credit cards. Gun-woo, get him a taxi. Why are you trying to get me out of here? You're not sure of yourself? Didn't you practice? Why don't we continue? Let's begin with the incomplete bar 164. Hey, focus. You may find it in the most unexpected places. Man, this... Let's see. His son's number isn't saved in his cell phone. He saved my number. "Ha I-deun." If I called him like crazy, shouldn't he try to remember who that person is? How can he mistake me for Yeong-ju or whatever her name is? I-deun. Take a look at this. Yeong-ju must be Mr. Kim's daughter. {\an8}MY LOVE, MY DAUGHTER YEONG-JU You don't look like her. She looks really sweet. You need to rest. Go back in. What are you doing here? Yeong-ju, what is this man looking for? Who's Yeong-ju? I'm I-deun. I won't ever act like your daughter Yeong-ju. Wait! Why aren't you playing it as a crescendo? If the composer wrote it like that, shouldn't you play it accordingly? Do it again. There's a cafe five minutes from here. Would you wait there? Toscanini said, "Cantabile Sostenere." "Sing. Sing even during the pauses." Don't goof around when it's not your turn. He wants you to maintain the same feeling. Do you know what you're doing right now? Goof around. Keep goofing around. Goof around during my turn. Goof off during someone else's turn. Beginning or end, just goof around. Let's have fun while we can. Is that it? Excuse me, sir. Do you know it's your fault? What happened to these people who were playing just fine? Give me the score. You know the crescendo part? Crescendo changed to sempre piano. What are you doing? Can't a score change according to the conductor's interpretation? Didn't I tell you there's no need for interpretation? You need to know the basics to interpret! You picked up conducting a few months ago! How dare you change... Come with me. Rip it. Get rid of your ridiculous interpretation. Purge it out and go with what I wrote down for you. I can't do that. What? You and I have very different styles. Don't you like Karajan and Toscanini? I don't like people who are so rigid. - I prefer Carlos Kleiber's more liberal-- - How old are you? How long did you conduct? You just started, and you insist on style? Preferences have nothing to do with age! People can have different tastes! Different? Are you sure you don't just want to be different? Pardon? Didn't you call Ru-mi to tell her to take care of me? Did you want to be cool that badly? Did you want to compensate for being dumped by acting cool? You didn't want to be a crybaby because of love, so you pretended to act cool but it was killing your ego, and you wanted to be compensated. Mr. Kang. Didn't you purposely want to force a difference so you can spite me and prevail? - I've been very patient. - Who told you to be patient? Just let it out! Get rid of the notion that you need to be nice and cool! How can you do music when you're bottled up? Do whatever your instinct tells you to do! Just let your determination, desperation, anger, and frustration out! Sure. I'll fight you. Don't come here ever again. Don't interfere with what I do. You don't want to participate in the orchestra festival? It's my orchestra. You can't do it alone. I'm the conductor! Starting now, I would like to do it my way. You're the conductor. Hey, can you not hear? Is Ru-mi sick? I'm not asking for preferential treatment. All I'm asking you to do is to listen to it once. The performance is very good. Who are they? I'm fine with you having a life and performing, but why must you do it now? Your dad got fired. He didn't get fired! Yes. It's true your daddy got fired. Hit me. Then why can't you remember me? I followed you around like crazy. I'll remember you, Ha I-deun. I want to be an amazing woman to him. She's still deaf. She has to quit music. Please do that for her. - We made it! - We made it? We made it! Maestro Kang has raised a tiger. Pianist Seo Hae-kyeong? She's performing with you. For the first time, I want to beat you. Subtitle translation by Jeong Lee
