 What are you doing? That was emotionless! Beethoven was completely deaf when he wrote this motif! Can't you do any better? We'll practice until we get it right! - I have a class. - Postpone all your lessons and classes. How can you teach when you're so horrible? You're way too harsh! - Jung-jin! - Let me be! I need to say what's on my mind! {\an8}We auditioned fair and square.

 {\an8}You have no right to treat us like this! {\an8}Didn't I tell you every performance and practice will be like an audition? But still, this isn't... Sure. I'll leave. I wanted to resolve this through communication, but I don't think we'll get anywhere. Inexperienced guest musicians and a disrespectful conductor... My patience ran out. Isn't this concert supposed to kickstart the Seokran Philharmonic? I wish you luck with half of the official members gone. Hey. Sir... Concertmaster.

 Hey. Hey! Holy cow. Gun-woo. I'm so sleepy now. I must have been really stressed about finding you. Hello? Hi, Aunt. I'm on my way to practice. Something came up. Yes. What? Okay. The orchestra members had a fight with Maestro Kang. They all left. We just want to think about it. Honestly, the conductor has a unique personality, don't you think? I don't like Maestro Kang either, but why are you asking us? Didn't Maestro Kang say something mean to you, too? Your father was taken aback when he came to see you. - Says who? - Well... We just heard... "Taken aback"? He completely stomped all over my dad. He was disrespectful to my dad! My dad didn't do anything wrong. He could come and watch me practice. But he scolded my dad for being an incompetent parent! I couldn't believe my ears. You were out of line back then. Think about what you did to him, too. You were always rude and you texted during rehearsals. Are you saying he did it on purpose? Are you saying he pissed me off so I would practice? Wake up, lady. He has a side like that? A side like... Absolutely. Mr. Kang is very thoughtful. He allowed a person like me to do a solo performance. Are you saying that you think "crap" has a good meaning? I see. Yes. Come to think of it, it's not like Maestro Kang gave me the solo because he was a saint. He was trying to spite me. He must have had his period. He's always PMS-ing. Gosh. Watch your language. He had a legitimate reason to be angry. You were terrible. You deserved the criticism. What did you just say? I deserved it? Deserve what? What about when Maestro Kang said you weren't even worth criticizing? That's completely different from-- What's wrong with our talent? We put on an amazing concert in two months. We're performing Beethoven's difficult "Symphony No. 9 'Choral.'" Why must we feel so inadequate? You're like a battered woman. - Sorry? - Haven't you heard of battered women? They have been abused all their lives, and later think that the abuse was justified. Didn't you say your heart races whenever you see Maestro Kang? And that you have to go to the restroom all of a sudden? Those are all symptoms of the battered woman syndrome. I think there's only one solution. We need to... Enough. Stop talking nonsense! You're going to rebel? You're going against the conductor? Don't be absurd! What's wrong, Grandpa? Didn't Maestro Kang say you have dementia and-- But Maestro Kang accepted us. What are you doing, telling everybody? - And you guys... - I was only worried. By the way, will you really not tell your children... Honestly, what benefit does he get from making our lives difficult? It's only exhausting for him. What benefit does he get? There's just one reason. He wants to make good music. He's fostering us. Did he breastfeed us or give us milk? What do you mean by "fostering us"? A conductor is like a ship captain. How dare you disobey the captain? We'll all die if the ship sinks! - Do you want that? - Grandpa, you're so old-school! - Gosh, you're old-fashioned. - You brat. Hi, Mr. Kim. - Hi. - Hey. What brings everyone here? I asked them to come. Come on in. Thank you. Are you here to help? - What? - With what? She's going to persuade the people who quit to come back. - Where's the list? - Right. Here you go. Their letters of resignation haven't been approved yet. We're really short on members. Can you each take five people and persuade them over the phone? I'm off to my test prep class. Oh, I-deun has to study. See you. Then, can you please call seven people each for me? I wonder if my husband is even eating on time. Why are there mosquitoes in the fall? This is all due to global warming. We need to cool the world. Hello, Mr. Kim. Yes, I know. I'm about to call them. Pardon? The choir, too? - The choir is quitting, too? - Hang on. What's with everyone? What is Mr. Kang going to do? That's what I want to ask! Where in the world is Maestro Kang? He's not picking up his phone! I heard you're not going to do the concert. It's not that. We believe the practice schedule is too tight. To be exact, your methods are a bit-- Are you referring to my sharp tongue that makes you feel bad, annoys you, and hurts your ego, and how I often extend rehearsals? If you're as blunt as that, I... Is there anything else? No, that's about it. I believe it's simply a difference in perspective. How is that simple? I get pissed off as soon as practice is over! In other words, you'll still do the concert, right? Not with you. I tried my best to persuade them, but, as you can see, the choir members are very adamant. I'm sorry, but can we at least have someone else direct our practices? Sure. Kang Gun-woo, come on in. Don't be so shy! Come here. He's going to lead your choir practices from now on. What? His name is Kang Gun-woo. We have the same name. He plays the trumpet in the orchestra. I can't say he majored in trumpet because he never attended music school. Excuse me, sir... Since he didn't attend music school, he didn't major in choir conducting. Just a few months ago, he didn't know how to read music, but he overcame it. Right now, he's learning how to conduct from me. Has it been two months since you started learning? Are you mocking me? No, I'm being sincere. What are you doing? Are you letting a person who just learned how to conduct lead our practices? Are his qualifications a problem? Did you reject me because I'm unqualified? Isn't it because of my methods? That's why I'm recommending him. He's the one who was in charge of Project Orchestra's practices. He was an astounding mediator for the orchestra members and me. What's the problem? But still, we think... Why? Are you surprised your strategy didn't work? My strategy? Didn't you think the choral symphony can't continue without the choir, so I had to listen to your requests? It's ridiculous to have two people conducting the same score... Accepting your proposal is a huge deal for me. I don't know what I'll do if you keep testing my patience. So do well. If Beethoven were to know, he would've called it off. I hope you're able to verify that this ordeal was all worth it. I'm sorry, but... Excuse us. From what you said, you seem to suggest that this is all our fault. - Is that right? - Yes. Who started this in the first place? You did. That's not true. There's no such thing as a bad orchestra member, but there is a bad conductor. You should've brought out our talent. You needed to encourage us and boost our morale. Don't blame this on others. This all happened because of you. You're the one who ruined it. How can the concert go on? Do you know how shocked I was this morning? I stopped by the orchestra office and it was being bombarded with faxes! There were 20 letters of resignation! That was expected to happen. Don't worry. Mr. Kang, I don't think this is the time for you to be arrogant. What did you say when you decided to establish the orchestra? Didn't you say I could choose whoever I wanted and train them to my liking? This is all part of a process. Do you think it's easy to find members who understand each other as if they're married? You're right. But even couples fight. These people aren't that bad. All you have to do is apologize, and they'll come back. That's why I didn't process the letters of resignation yet. If I do, it will be as if a divorce has been finalized. In my opinion, I think that if you were to-- Just process them. We were never meant to be from the start. All you need to do is apologize. What's so difficult about saying you're sorry? I didn't do anything I need to apologize for. I can't do it. Don't they say losing is winning? Losers made that up to make themselves feel better. I can't do it. What about the concert? I already have people from the audition on standby. I can call them. Mr. Kim, do you have the list? Yes, but... I called everyone this morning, but-- - You called? - Well... They all refused. What? Why? Why won't they do it? They feel bad. Things like that. I believe the members who quit are getting everyone to gang up... Please call me back. Bye. What happened to the clarinet player? I called him this morning, but he won't do it. He seems to be close to the members who quit. What do we need the most? A violinist? Yes. Should I play the recordings of the auditions? What about changing the score? Is there a reason why we have to hire more people to perform the choral-- Would that make them come back? Will they say I don't have to apologize? Anyhow, this is war. I want to show them that I'm perfectly fine without them. I won't make it mediocre. Plus, I can't use the backup members if I do. Sorry? Didn't Crap, Cabaret, Dementia, Slacker, and friends practice the symphony like mad? They can't perform if I change the score. Then, because of the backup members... I'll look for replacements, then. - Do you want coffee, too? - No. Maestro Kang is in a bad mood. Leave him alone. Mr. Kang, should I make you feel better? Ta-da! It's a special edition. There's a ten-page article about you. Forget it. Leave. Let me read some of it to you. Let's see... Even the head editor mentioned you. I haven't read this. I'll read this to you first. "World-famous, Korean-born conductor Kang Gun-woo. Although he isn't as renowned as Jung Myeong-hwan, he's very talented, and he's back in Korea to conduct a city orchestra. Some people say it's the return of the king. He's a role model for those who insist on working only with famous orchestras. It will bring an unprecedented change in the classical music of Korea." He said that so well. "But there's one thing I wonder. How long will he last... at the city orchestra?" Read it. "How long will he last at the city orchestra? He has never stayed with an orchestra for more than six months. It was either he left or the members left. The longest he stayed was five and a half months and the shortest was a day." Keep going. Is he an idiot? What he said was true. Continue. "I want to make a prediction. I'm positive the members will go on a strike. They may want an apology because of Maestro Kang's unique personality. Honestly, Maestro Kang could care less about the city orchestra. So, therefore, he'll leave after a month. Actually, this isn't a prediction because this is how Maestro Kang is." One month. I'll have to last at least a month. What's this person's name? How dare he write something like this? Don't blame him. You're the one who bought the magazine. I'm sorry. I really haven't read this before. When do you ever do anything right? You're careless and you're always causing problems. I'm not surprised. I don't feel better, but it provoked me. You may leave. I think two of the people who left will come back. - I met up with them, but... - What? Why did you meet with them? Because we're short on members... I'll take care of... Answer me. Ru-mi, are you still the concertmaster? No. Are you really close to me? What's this? You look like you're disappointed. Don't create a fantasy just because I made you soup and made you jump in the lake. I think you're an untalented and deaf orchestra member who's a troublemaker. Oh, there's one more. You're my pupil's girlfriend. Focus on the basics. Don't stick your nose in everywhere. You look like an airhead. I know you're not in a good mood. Sorry for acting rude and sticking my nose in. But I... I just wanted to cheer you up. Use that energy on Gun-woo, not me! Don't cry. You're not that close. He's the conductor and you're an orchestra member. He just made things clear. You're going to meet soon? Okay, what are you going to say to Maestro Kang, lady? You can't do that. You and Mr. Bae are our negotiation representatives. No matter what, don't give in to Maestro Kang. He has a very strong personality, so... What are you talking about? What negotiation with Maestro Kang? I would like to confirm our demands with you. First, treat the orchestra members with respect. Second, do not make us practice more than the designated time. Third, we would like an apology for your insulting remarks and a promise that it will never happen again. You agree with us, right? It's a bit similar... Are you all out of your mind? How? How could you do this? Ru-mi, tell me what's going on. How could they... Maestro Kang is the one who accepted us as backup members and allowed us to perform! Accept? We got in fair and square! He never would've accepted us if we weren't good... Hey! I might end up hitting you. Sit down if you don't want to get hit. Are you a part of this? I told them not to, but I think they've had enough. It's true that Maestro Kang is mean. Mean? Backstabbers who act nice to your face are worse. Did Maestro Kang do that? Has he ever completely abandoned us? He gave us the boot after the concert. So, did he fire us? Aren't you a member? - That's because... - Do you think we forced our way in? Maestro Kang is the conductor and artistic director. If he wants, he can fire the concertmaster and all the first players. Why would he be scared of the backup members? Why do you think he made sure we came and made us watch the practices every day? He made a way for us to get in. Don't you get it? Who was the one who took responsibility of an orchestra consisted of amateurs? It was Maestro Kang. Wasn't Maestro Kang the one who made up a backup position, allowed us to perform in the choral symphony, and accepted you in the end too? Maestro Kang has never beaten us. He complained all the time, but he never once tried to beat us. He should be nice... He probably thought we already knew because he did us a huge favor. He thought we had an unspoken bond. He thinks we're close? Give me a break. He's just like you, I-deun. You think we're close even though you give me an attitude. That's like Maestro Kang. He's acting just like you. Is he stupid? He is stupid. That's why he got stabbed in the back. Can you say something? They agree with you, right? I would like to talk to them. Go ahead. Excuse me. It will be awkward for us if the leaders leave. - We'll leave it to you. - If you leave... You can smile. Why are you holding yourself back when you have the chance to get back at a person who has always mistreated you? Why don't you jump for joy? You don't have friends, do you? You're an outcast, right? Life is meant to be lived alone. Friends are a fantasy. That's why all you have is a dog. Mr. Kang, we're not here to protest. We're here to make a decision. The concert must go on. So can you please be humble and apologize? Why should I apologize? I just said it as it is. Water is water. Poop is poop. Actually, weren't you crap? And you're... - Unworthy to say anything to? - At least you know. Okay, let's be honest while we're at it. I'm not here as an orchestra member. - Mr. Yong-gi. - Let go. Let's talk. Man to man. Other than conducting, what are you good at? You're stubborn, hot-tempered, foul-mouthed-- I've always heard that. Do you have anything original? I have plenty of original things to say, so hang on. You know you're standing on a cliff. I know you were hurt. Don't act all cool. You're the one who's crap! What's the matter with you? Don't you think it's despicable? You bow down to me when I was strong, but turn against me when I'm vulnerable. What would your children think of you? What? Look here, Mr. Kang. It's inappropriate of you to mention his children. How could you... He doesn't know! He doesn't know what children and friends mean to people. That's why he raises a dog! Despicable? I think you're more despicable! Yes, I used to be so scared of you. I was so nervous. But do you know what else? I felt sorry for you. To be honest, what do you know? Do you know about love, friendship, loyalty, sentiment, or emotions? They make life interesting! They're the most fun and important things! But you don't have anything except for the music in your head! - We have a different view in... - You're pompous until the end. You stink. I need to plug my nose! You didn't expect this from us, right? I'm sure of it because you're a fool. This is what you call a fool. Yong-gi, that's enough. Stop. We're cowards, but you played a big role in this. You won't allow us to say anything, so we have a lot of animosity toward you. You mentioned children, right? You're in no position to lecture him about raising children. I really think people like you should never raise children. What would your child learn? That's why he only has a dog. He knows that, too. Nothing good will come out of this by talking on and on, so I'll cut to the chase. Just apologize. Please? It's only one word. S-O-R-R-Y. Is that so hard to say? That one word can save you, us, the city orchestra, the choir, and Mr. Beethoven! But you refuse to do it. Pretend to give in just this once. I know it's difficult, but that's how everyone lives. They apologize numerous times a day. We have our pride, too. All we're trying to do is make a living. You're the abnormal one. You're being immature, Mr. Kang. Sorry for bothering you. Please think about it. I have a question. Yes? I'm going to ask you three questions. Answer me honestly. Am I a freak? Pardon? Do I have a crappy personality? What's gotten into you? Am I a lowlife jerk? Yes, I am. I most definitely am. Gun-woo, take all of my conducting techniques, but not my temper. My temper? I don't know if I have any temper left for you to even take. Do you want to debut as a conductor? You know the first score? Why don't you conduct it? It's a short piece. You can do it. Why? I'm preparing to retire. Please get out. What are you doing? What's wrong with you? I'll answer your questions, so get out. What's this? What? It's a car, right? I liked this car so much, so I spent my entire savings to buy it. But one day, it said it wasn't a car, but a cuckoo bird. It wants to forget everything and fly away. How do you think I'll feel? You want me to answer your questions? A freak? You sure are. Yes, you have a crappy personality. A lowlife jerk? Didn't you know you were a jerk? You didn't know for the past 40 years? You're 40. Haven't you experienced all sorts of things in life? Aren't you supposed to be more firm about how to live your life? But why are you acting like a crybaby? Are you trying to console me? No, I'm not. It's a warning! Don't run away. If you really want to run away, go quietly in the middle of the night. I would never console you. Why would I console you? You're my teacher, my conductor, my big brother, and a 40-year-old adult. That's it? Why? Should I hit you? That will have to wait until next time. Let's go. Where? The suit is nice, but not the person. You want me to lead choir practice while wearing this? Didn't I tell you about the first score? Aren't you going to conduct it? Sir... Why do you look surprised? I'm only using you. I want the audience to make a comparison. "Oh, the first conductor is okay. But who's the second conductor? He's so amazing. There's a reason he's the head conductor." Prepare well and make sure the choir practices. You know the symphony is being modified to go without the choir, right? Yes. I'm going to make the orchestra practice both ways. If they're horrible during the rehearsal, I'll go with the version without them. I have no choice. I can't ruin the concert. The success of "Symphony No. 9" is in your hands, so do well. Okay. It's the first score you'll conduct as your debut performance. Don't be perfect because I need to shine. Sure. That was a joke. If you do poorly, I'll put a stamp on you and ship you off to Myeong-hwan. Okay. - Go change. - Okay. How are you and Ru-mi doing? We're good. A 40-year-old man. Become more firm? Everything is crumbling away. An airhead? Let's fight! Come to the front office. Cock-a-doodle-doo. Feisty Chicken. I took care of Gun-woo and texted him. I'm done practicing the violin. I have time to spare, so I can take care of... That's so obvious. What should I say? I have time to spare. Did you meet up with Mr. Bae... No, don't even mention that. I have time to spare. An airhead. You said I was an airhead, right? I'll show you what an airhead really is. My mouth... can extend like flour dough. I can stuff seven of these in my mouth. I'll show you the epitome of being an airhead. Can I still do it? I haven't tried it since high school. You can do it, Ru-mi. Make him laugh. Just let yourself go. You really did that in high school? It was because I was bored... Why were you hiding in the corner? In the corner? I'm not sure. You know my dog Thoven? He always goes to a corner when he's hurt or sick. He avoids other animals to prevent being attacked. It's an animal instinct. I'm a mammal, too. I have a headache. Aren't you going to ask about Hui-yeon and Yong-gi coming by? They said I was immature. They said other people live bowing their heads. They told me not to have any kids. They would feel sorry for them. So I'm planning on apologizing. If I don't, we won't have enough time to practice. Everyone wants me to, so, as the conductor, I should listen to them. How hard can it be? I can do it. Tell everyone to meet tomorrow at 2 o'clock. I'll apologize, bow my head, and say I'm sorry. I'll make this short. Let me read this to you. "I'm Kang Gun-woo, the artistic director and conductor of Seokran Philharmonic. I thought about many things when the orchestra members began to defy me. I wondered why this happened, why they didn't trust me, and why I couldn't understand them. Perhaps this happened because of my misconduct. Therefore, I made a decision. Starting today, I, Kang Gun-woo, will be reborn as a conductor and a human being. I want to say this to you from the bottom of my heart... I sincerely... I sincerely apologize..." I can't do it! Why? Because I don't mean it! I wrote this against my will because you pressured me. Your three conditions? I can't accept them. - Mr. Kang. - Ban extending practice? Why not? You should do it if you need it. Practice longer, and you'll get paid more, improve, perform well, and get experience. You'll gain four things by doing so. Why won't you do it? Your rights? I've already gone over this. Third, you want me to... Whatever. You want me to apologize. Let me ask you this. Have I ever scolded you for anything other than your skills? Have I ever been ill-prepared for practice and wasted your time? No, right? So what's the problem? - Don't you see? The way you-- - Talk? Then let me summarize your conditions. "Mr. Kang, change the way you talk." Sorry, but I can't change the way I talk either. With a little exaggeration, I've talked like this since I began speaking. That's why my whole family hates me, too. But what can I do? This is who I am. However, I'll promise you a few things. I'll make sure you get paid overtime and get bonus pay for every performance. We won't play the national anthem for free just because we're the city orchestra. I'll make sure you'll get paid for every note that you play. We'll only perform what's scheduled. No sudden events. We won't accompany the mayor's son, daughter, nephew, or anyone. We'll stick to our scheduled performances. And, above all else, I won't embarrass you. I'll make sure you're confident with the music we perform in front of its composer and the audience. I'll make sure that everyone who listens to our music will find hope. That's my... That's my ultimate objective in leading the city orchestra and my dream. I wish for you to... share the same dream. Ru-mi. Satisfied? Don't cry anymore. He didn't apologize. Forget it. Let's go. Concertmaster. Go ahead. - Goodbye. - Bye. - You're really going to quit? - I started this whole thing. - But still... - It was a tough decision. I'll be unemployed. Practice hard. I wish you a successful concert. But it won't be easy. But he tried to apologize. No, it's the same as apologizing. This is definitely an apology in Maestro Kang's books. - We should accept it. - Are you crying? I've only cried twice in my life. When the women's handball team lost at the Olympics, and when I accidentally ate a spoonful of wasabi. The air is bad in here. We need to air out this room. Jung-jin, I couldn't sleep at all last night. I felt really bad after what I said to Maestro Kang. To be honest, he never said anything wrong. The way he talks is a technicality. Just let it go. He said he can't change it Can we just tell him to rip up the letters of resignation? Oh, my. Thanks, Jung-jin. - Thanks. - He has some charm. That's it. Thanks for practicing an hour longer without any complaints. But starting tomorrow, we'll practice two extra hours. It's not the time to complain. Practice the fourth movement, presto, and I'll see you at 7:00 a.m. tomorrow. I'll do whatever it takes to fill in the empty positions before the concert. Don't worry about that. Let's call it a day. Great job. Great job. Great job! Mr. Kang, happy birthday! You must be surprised. You're at a loss for words. Happy birthday, sir. - We collected money and bought it. - It was 10,000 won per person. Mr. Kang, set aside your disappointment and that feeling of betrayal. We actually love you. This is from me. - What the... - That trader. You act just like how you look. It's cheap. Say something. Are you mute? Today is not my birthday. - What? - What? I follow the lunar calendar. Ru-mi, you should've gotten his birthday right. Gun-woo was the one who prepared all this. She did everything. She bought the cake, the poppers, and a disposable camera to take pictures. - She made us practice the birthday song. - She was so strict. I think it was harder than the symphony. It's a good thing to celebrate more. Please turn off the lights. Here, sir. Blow out the candles on a count of three, okay? All together! One, two... Oh, no... I can't believe a conductor can't keep the beat! Turn on the lights. Sir. Can you say something for us? I don't remember the last time I celebrated my birthday. That's it? Wow, that was long. Taking pictures is the best thing that will get rid of this awkwardness. - Ru-mi, the camera. - She gave it to me and left. - She said she's busy. - Is she seeing someone? I should ask Gun-woo. Is Ru-mi dating anyone? Pardon? No. No! Mr. Kang, who we love and respect, I thought about what I should do with this cake. But there was only one conclusion. I should pay respect, but I should uphold tradition too. There's something I need to do to sincerely celebrate your birthday. The last thing... Sir. Don't do it! Don't do it! Stop it! Are you okay? Oh, my gosh! Gosh, I can't get this right. Hey, Feisty Chicken. Where are you looking? Look at me. Mic test. Feisty Chicken, mutt, idiot, moron. She's my concertmaster! She's my concertmaster and they are my orchestra members! Just follow my lead and you'll be fine. A bit smoother. Yes, that's it. You're doing fine, Feisty Chicken. What will you do? You're in big trouble, Ru-mi. This is war! We're in a state of an emergency! I'll do whatever it takes to postpone today's concert, but after this crazy weather dies down. Turn it off. Hang on. Stop! Fine, then I'll ask you a favor. Many people had to evacuate their homes. I have 50 people staying at the performance center. They're very upset, so please be mindful while preparing for the concert. Hold it tight! Hold that side. Hold it! It will be blown away. THE FIRST CONCERT OF SEOKRAN PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA - Mom, what's that? - Don't look. Rich people who have money to burn are here to play. - You must be rich. - How nice for you. You're rich. It won't work. It's in too deep. I'm going nuts! The wheel is stuck, and it won't budge! What do you mean? Which instruments? Your contrabass, timpani, all the instruments! A tractor? They're all stationed at the flooded areas! It will take two hours for them to come! All the shovels are broken! Hello? You rent out tractors, right? Yes, our instruments are about to get ruined... How can it take three hours? Yes. - What do you mean getting upset? - How long will it take? My contrabass is about to get ruined, man! I'm sorry, hang on. Hello? Hello? He hung up? He hung up on me? - Hyeok-gwon, can you keep it down? - Shut up! What's the matter? - Hello? - Ru-mi. - Yes. - Look here. - It's urgent. - Maestro Kang needs to sign this. Can you get his signature? - Maestro Kang? - Yes. - No, I won't go. - Come on. Maestro Kang is pissed off, so everyone is getting chewed out. He favors you, so do this for me, will you? - No, I definitely won't! - Man... Hello? What? - The water pipe burst? My gosh. - It's urgent. They're spewing water on us from above and below. - Okay, I'll be right over. I'm on my way! - Really? I'm leaving this to you! You have to get this signed! - Yes. - Okay, I'm coming! - Mr. Kim! - I said I'm on my way! Wow, it's so quiet. It's like heaven in here. Oh, man. It looks nice, but it doesn't work. Move. Can you sign these documents... Can't you see I'm working? Wait. People need your approval as soon as... There's an explanation on the back. - Were you sick? - Sorry? I hadn't seen you in a few days. Did you go to your parents? No. Were you hanging out with Gun-woo? It can't be. Gun-woo was too busy conducting the choir. Are you cheating on him? Make sure you get along. He's a good catch. Did you show Gun-woo you stuffing yourself with crackers? Mr. Kang, I think I like Gun-woo. You're dating him, aren't you? But I don't know how Gun-woo feels. He seems to like you, right? I know he likes you. Is that so? Mr. Kang, do you really think so? I'm referring to the other Gun-woo. I don't get it. Where's Mr. Kang? I'm referring to the other Gun-woo. Not the young, cute, nice, and handsome Gun-woo. But the old, nasty, selfish, twisted, and mean Gun-woo. I'm sorry, I wasn't trying to eavesdrop-- Say it again. Who? How dare you take a tractor from the flooded area, you jerk! Let me take down my instrument! Come watch. Each ticket is over 30,000 won. - What about almsgiving? - You bastard! Shouldn't majority of the seats be filled up if it's 30 minutes before the show? Was one of your members involved in a 300-million-won scandal? Who is this, Yeong-ju? - Who is Yeong-ju? - How would I know? I want to ignore that jinx, but this is way too harsh! Are you okay? I told you I'm fine! It's Choi Seok-gyun's company! Aren't you conducting the first score? Don't think of running away. Go change into your tux and let me check it. Maestro Kang is the one who had faith in me when I gave up on myself. I went to see the choir... Do you know why I hit you? But I'm pushing forward because it's you! Because you're weeds! The choral symphony will be performed without a choir. Sir!
