   C'mon! Running like a fugitive, Being chased by something Inside my heart is pounding My throat dry like it's withering For no single one, To none does belong, This time is ours, right now... Unraveling the pain, Unraveling our hearts, Unraveling shadows Stifling our breath, Reaching for beyond, Tearing through the dark In fighting and in love To the distant light above, Yes, we are on the way I wanna rock... Rockin' my heart He's late. Naruto! Stay still. Why's it that only our squad's teacher is late? The other squads have gone off somewhere with their new teachers, and Iruka Sensei's also left. Don't look at me. Hey, what're you doing, Naruto?! Hey! Lt'll be his fault because he's late. Man! You're asking for it! I like stuff like this! A Jonin wouldn't get caught in such a weak booby trap. That's right. You're such an idiot! I got him, I got him... I-I'm sorry, sir. I tried to stop him, but Naruto did it on his own... It's all good. Get real. Is he really a Jonin? How can I put this? As for my first impression of you guys? Well, I hate you. Pass or Fail. Survival Test Let's see. First off, let me have you guys introduce yourselves. Introduce ourselves... What should we say? Your likes, dislikes, your future dream, hobbies, things like that! Hey! Before that, please tell us about yourself. Me? My name's Kakashi Hatake. I don't feel like telling you guys about my likes and dislikes. I've never really thought about my future dream... As for my hobbies, I have many. In the end, isn't all we know his name? Yeah. Next is you guys. Let's start with you. My name's Naruto Uzumaki! I like instant ramen, but what I like even more is the ramen from Ichiraku that Iruka Sensei treats me to. What I dislike is the three minutes after pouring hot water in the instant ramen. My hobby is eating and comparing ramen! And my future dream... is to surpass the Hokage! And so I'm going to get the entire village to acknowledge my existence! I see... this kid's grown up in an interesting way. Okay, next. I'm Sakura Haruno. What I like... I mean, who I like is... And, my hobby is, I mean... My future dream is... And? What about your dislikes? Naruto! Girls at her age are probably more interested in love than the Ninja Arts. And lastly. My name's... Sasuke Uchiha. I have lots of dislikes, but no likes in particular. Oh... And... I don't feel like summing up my ambition as just a dream but I do have an ambition! The ambition to restore my clan and without fail... to kill a certain man! He doesn't... mean me, does he? Sure enough, Sasuke's cool. I knew it... Good! The three of you are very distinctive and interesting! We'll have a mission tomorrow! Yes, sir! What kind of mission? First, we'll do what we can do with just four people. What what what?! A survival exercise. Survival exercise? Why are we doing an exercise even though this is supposed to be a mission? We've had more than our share of exercises in the Academy! This is no simple exercise. Then... then what kind of exercise is it? Hey! What's so funny, Sensei? Uh, well, if I tell you, I know you'll grow disenchanted. What? Of the twenty seven graduates, only nine will be recognized as junior ninjas. The remaining eighteen will be sent back to the Academy. In other words, this exercise is an extremely difficult test with a failure rate of 66% or higher! See, see? You got disenchanted! That's crazy! To have suffered that much! T-Then, what was the graduation test for? Oh, that. It was just to select those who have the potential of becoming Genin. Whaaaat?! Well, that's the way it is. I'll be determining whether you pass or fail. Bring your complete set of Ninja tools! We meet at five in the morning. N-No way am I going to be dropped now! I've got to have my strength recognized for real. I'll be separated from Sasuke if I fail this test. This is an exercise of love! Okay! You're dismissed. Oh... And you'd best skip breakfast. You'll throw up. Morning. Hi, folks. Good morning! You're late! Well, a black cat crossed my path, you see. Ahem! Oh well... Okay, it's set for 12:00! Today's assignment is to take these bells away from me by noon. Those who can't do it won't get lunch. They'll be tied to that... and I'll eat my lunch before your very eyes. So that was the point... for us not to eat breakfast... But, hold on. Why are there only two bells? There are only two, so at the very least, one will have to go to the logs. That person will be disqualified for failing the mission... and will return to the Academy. It might be one person at the very least, or it could be all three of you. You can use your Shuriken. You won't be able to take the bells unless you come with the intent to kill me. But, that's dangerous, sir! Y-Yeah, that's right! You couldn't even evade a chalkboard eraser! In this world, those who aren't skilled enough tend to complain more. Well, just ignore the loser... Begin when I give the "ready-go" signal. Loser, loser, loser. Don't be so hasty. I didn't say start, yet. No way...! I didn't see him at all. So this is a Jonin. But, that's fine. At least you came with the intent to kill me. How can I put this? I feel like I'm finally starting... to like you guys. We're going to start. Ready... start! What do you want to know? I didn't think you just came here to drink tea. The Jonin in Naruto and company's Group Seven... What kind of teacher is he? Is he strict? You mean Kakashi? Does he concern you? I heard a rumor that concerns me. What's this? It's a pass fail list of the junior ninjas Kakashi has been in charge of up until now. Let me have a look. T-This is! Fundamentally, ninja must mask their presence and hide. Okay, everyone is hidden pretty well... Alright! Let's face off fair and square! Oh? That goof. Say, aren't you a bit off kilter? What's off kilter is your hairstyle! I'll teach you the first Shinobi Battle Jutsu... Taijutsu. Taijutsu...? That's ninja hand to hand combat... That being said... he's going to use weapons? Make Out Paradise What's the matter? Why don't you come at me? But hey... what's with the book? Why do you ask? It's because I was curious about what happens next. Don't worry. With you guys as opponents, it makes no difference if I'm reading or not. I'm going to rip you apart! Damn! This time a spin kick! Man! Wha?! Ninja shouldn't let the enemy take them from behind multiple times, fool. The way his hands are positioned... Is that the Sign of the Tiger?! No way! With Naruto as his opponent, that's too strong a Ninjutsu no matter how you look at it. That Sign... It's a fire style skill. That idiot teacher's doing more than just running around? Naruto, get out of there quick! You'll die! Too late. Leaf Village Secret! Ultimate Taijutsu! One Thousand Years of Death! Oh, it's not a Ninjutsu. Those two are idiots. Alright... Even so, isn't that against the rules? What're we supposed to do about his strength? Damn it! It wasn't supposed to be like this. It... can't be! This is more than just a rumor. Kakashi's test might be a bit difficult... Even so, this means absolutely no one has passed! That's right... Kakashi has never had someone pass. They have all... been annihilated... What's the matter? You won't get lunch if you can't take the bell by noon. I know that, I say. You're not very energetic, considering you said that you'd surpass the Hokage. Damn it! Damn it! I can fight even if I'm hungry. I didn't even have dinner last night. I shouldn't have gone on a diet. I just got a bit careless earlier! Damn! I'm hungry, so my strength... But... I've got to take the bell, no matter what. No matter what... I'm... not... turning back now! I'm going to become a Ninja! Security is your greatest enemy! Now for my favorite Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu! Seven... Narutos? What? They're not just images? Are they all real? The real thing? Not the clone, but the shadow clone, eh. If you ever lay a hand on Iruka Sensei, I'll kill you! Show me what you can do, Demon Fox! Those aren't just images but actual clones! That's an advanced Ninjutsu! It's the forbidden Jutsu that did in Mizuki. Judging from your ability, that Jutsu should have a one-minute limit. Even if you talk trash, Naruto is Naruto after all is said and done... You still can't beat me with that skill. W-What?! Behind me?! Ninja shouldn't let the enemy take them from behind. Right, Kakashi Sensei? Using the Shadow Clone, I had one of them come up from the bottom of the river and sneak behind you! Here's one for that attack on my butt earlier! Naruto, not bad! So... a diversionary tactic, eh? Now... allow me to punch you! What?! The one who got punched was... Naruto? Ouch! You! You're Kakashi Sensei, right?! You used the Transformation Jutsu to change yourself, didn't you?! It's you! You're Kakashi Sensei, I say. You smell like Kakashi Sensei! The smell of an old guy! Why you! Hey! For the time being, let's try undoing the Jutsu. If we do that, only the two will remain... so... You should've realized that sooner, you idiot! You're me, you idiot! Just undo the Jutsu! Naruto... You're embarrassing to watch... That was the Substitution Jutsu, you fool. Essentially, it's a skill used to quickly switch one's own body with an object or animal. This makes your enemy think you're being attacked, but then you strike during their unguarded moment. After letting himself get caught by the real Naruto, the Jonin fool switched bodies with one of the clone Narutos. Not only did he make Naruto think he'd been nailed... he used Naruto's own attack on him. A bell?! You really must have been in a hurry. You've dropped a bell! What the heck is this?! Of course it's a trap... H-H-Hey! That jonin doesn't lower his guard even when he's fighting Naruto. The bell! You have to think when using Jutsu. They can be used against you. Also... ...don't get caught in an obvious trap, you fool. A Ninja must see through deception! I know that, I say! You know, I'm telling you because you don't get it. Listen up! Your movements are wasteful. Now! He finally dropped his guard! You're so... No way! You jerk Sasuke! You're overdoing it! Damn it! At this rate, there's no way I can beat Kakashi Sensei. But if I don't take the bell... I won't get lunch... No... I'll fail the test! He says a Ninja must see through deception, but I have no idea what that means. How in the world can I take the bell back from Kakashi Sensei?! Next episode: "You Failed! Kakashi's Final Decision" Don't miss my outstanding performance!
