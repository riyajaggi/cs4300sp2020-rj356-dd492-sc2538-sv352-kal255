   C'mon! Running like a fugitive, Being chased by something Inside my heart is pounding My throat dry like it's withering For no single one, To none does belong, This time is ours, right now... Unraveling the pain, Unraveling our hearts, Unraveling shadows Stifling our breath, Reaching for beyond, Tearing through the dark In fighting and in love To the distant light above, Yes, we are on the way I wanna rock... Rockin' my heart Such intensity... If I take a breath or move my eyes I will be marked and killed - that's what I'm feeling... If I'm stuck like this for an hour, I'll go mad. Facing a Jonin intent to kill... This sensation is like having my life held in limbo... No way! I'd rather die to escape this feeling! Sasuke... Don't worry. I'll protect you all with my life. I absolutely won't allow my comrades to get killed. I don't know about that... It's over. Sensei! Behind you!! Die!! The Water Clone Jutsu...? It can't be. Don't move! The Oath of Pain It's over. W-Wow!! Did you say it's over? You don't understand, do you? You won't be able to beat me just by making like a monkey... No chance. But, I must say you're good. My Water Clone Jutsu was being copied at that point... I absolutely won't allow my comrades to get killed. By letting the clone talk as if it were you, you succeeded in distracting me. And you used Hidden Mist Jutsu to hide yourself to see what I was doing... But... I'm not a fool. That one was a fake too! Now! Makibishi spikes! How foolish! Sensei! Oh, I can't believe that Kakashi Sensei got... kicked away like that... His Taijutsu skills are also extremely good. W-What's with this water...? It's awfully heavy. Humph... Fool! It's the Water Prison Jutsu! Darn it. My temporary escape into the water... was a huge mistake! You're caught... It's a special prison that makes it impossible for you to escape! It makes things harder having you able to act. Now... Kakashi. I'll have to settle things with you later. First, I will finish those guys off. Water Clone Jutsu... Didn't expect this level of skill... You're acting big, wearing a headband like a Ninja... But... a real Ninja is one who has hovered between life and death numerous times. In other words, only those who are worth being listed in my Bingo Book deserve to be called Ninja. Guys like you can't be called real Ninja. He's disappeared again! You're just a kid! Naruto! You three! Take Tazuna and run! You have no chance against this guy! As long as he has me trapped in this Water Prison, he won't be able to move from here. And he shouldn't be able to use the Water Clone Jutsu if he's far enough away from his real body. In any case, just run for now! Run away? You've got to be kidding me. That option was gone from the moment you got caught. Even if we ran, without you, sooner or later we'd be defeated by Zabuza... and we'd all be destroyed. Even if we were to reform the Manji defense, it would be impossible to block his attacks. In the end... we'll have... no options left. In order for us to survive, our only option is to rescue you. We'll just have to do it! There! Too easy. Sasuke! Sasuke... T-This is the Jonin level... A real Ninja... We've got to run... At this rate... Seriously! Seriously! We'll be killed!! I'm going to swear on the pain of my left hand! I'll never get into another situation from which I'll have to be rescued... I'll never be afraid or be a coward. Are you hurt... scaredy cat? I won't lose to Sasuke. Can I borrow that Leaf headband for a while? This? This is worn only by those who have graduated from Ninja Academy. Naruto, come over here. I'd like to give you something. Congratulations on your graduation. That's because you're all squirts who don't have the qualifications to become Ninjas. Missions are all risky assignments. You pass! I'm not that little prankster that you think I am! I'm going to surpass the Hokage! And so I'm going to get the entire Village to acknowledge my existence! That's right... I am a Ninja now. And... I decided that I was not going to run anymore! That I wouldn't run away! Y-You fool! Stop it! Oh, Naruto! What are you thinking?! Humph! Fool... What are you thinking... charging off on your own?! Even Sasuke is no match for him... No matter how hard we try, we Genin are no match for him... Huh?! The headband...?! Hey! You, with no brows... Record in your Bingo Book... about the man who will one day become the Leaf Village's Hokage. Leaf-style Ninja... Naruto Uzumaki!! Naruto... When I first saw that little kid, he seemed so unreliable... Sasuke! Lend me your ear! What is it? I have a plan. You want to discuss plans under these circumstances? This guy! Humph! You are talking of teamwork? W-What is this feeling? Was Naruto so? Now... Let's get wild... Now, let's get wild! Such loud snorting, but do you have a winning plan? T-This isn't good... What are you guys doing! I told you to run! It was obvious what was going to happen once I was caught! Hurny! Run! Listen to me! Our mission is to protect Tazuna! Have you forgotten that?! Old man... Well... This is a seed that I planted... I can't say that I want my life to be spared. Sorry, you guys... Fight as much as you want! You hear that? Are you ready? You guys really haven't learned anything, have you? W-What?! You're still playing at being Ninja? When I was your age, this hand was already stained red with blood! Zabuza, the Demon! Ohh? It seems that you've heard of me. A long time ago, in the Mist Village, often called the town of Blood Mist, Ninja candidates faced their biggest hurdle. So you also know about that graduation exam... That graduation exam? What is it? This graduation exam that you're talking about... The students killed each other. What? Classmates who had shared rice from the same pot formed pairs and tried to kill each other. It didn't end until one of them died. Partners who used to talk about each other's dreams and aspirations... How cruel... Ten years ago, the Mist Village's graduation exam was forced to undergo drastic reform. That was because an evil demon had appeared on the scene the previous year. Reform? What about the reform? What had that evil demon done? With no scruples or hesitation... a young boy who didn't even have the qualifications for being a Ninja, annihilated over a hundred examinees. That sure was... fun... Sasuke! Die! Darn! Shadow Clone Jutsu! Ah... Shadow Clone Jutsu, and there are quite a few of them. Here I go! It's impossible, after all... There is no way that you can defeat the guy! There is only one way left to defeat this guy! Sasuke! I see! So that's your plan, Naruto! That's pretty good for you! Demon Wind Shuriken, Windmill of Shadows... A Shuriken won't work on me. I see. This time it's aiming for my real body... But... It's not so easy! A Shuriken in the Shuriken's shadow! This is... The Shadow Shuriken Jutsu! A second Shuriken in his blind spot! But... Still too naïve... He dodged it!! Here it is! Yes! The plan worked!! That Zabuza had no clue as to what I was thinking, and I fooled him! Ninja must be able to see through the obvious. Did you see that - the Leaf style fighting of Naruto Uzumaki?! Kakashi Sensei, the rest is up to you. Next episode: "Kakashi, Sharingan Warrior!" I'm going to kick butt once again!
