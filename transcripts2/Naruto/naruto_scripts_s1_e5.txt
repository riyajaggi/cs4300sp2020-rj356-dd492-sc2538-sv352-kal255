   C'mon! Running like a fugitive, Being chased by something Inside my heart is pounding My throat dry like it's withering For no single one, To none does belong, This time is ours, right now... Unraveling the pain, Unraveling our hearts, Unraveling shadows Stifling our breath, Reaching for beyond, Tearing through the dark In fighting and in love To the distant light above, Yes, we are on the way I wanna rock... Rockin' my heart You have to think when using Jutsu. They can be used against you. Also, don't get caught in an obvious trap, you fool. A Ninja must see through deception... got it? I know that! You know, you say that because you don't get it. Listen up. Your movements are wasteful. Now! He finally dropped his guard! You're so... No way! You jerk Sasuke! You overdid it. Damn! Another substitution? He must have found out my location with those Shuriken! He purposely lowered his guard! Serves me right... I fell for the trap. So he's over there, eh... Sasuke... Where are you?! Don't tell me, Kakashi Sensei already... No! That couldn't happen to Sasuke, right?! Safe! He didn't notice me. Sakura, behind you. Huh?! What's up with that "A Ninja must see through deception" stuff?! Damn it! I'll never fall for his trap again! I fell for it again! You Failed! Kakashi's Final Decision What was that?! Huh?! Hold on! Where's Sensei?! Huh?! What's going on?! Huh?! What's what?! Sakura... Sasuke?! Sa... Saku... ra... P-Please... help... me... Maybe I went a bit overboard... But it's really something she should notice... Was that voice... Sakura's? Shinobi Battle Skill #2, Genjutsu. Sakura was easily lured. Genjutsu, huh...? An illusory mind controlling technique. I'm not surprised she got lured. However... I'm different from them. Why don't you say that after you get a bell... Sasuke? It's no use just using straightforward attacks. A trap?! What?! This guy's...?! What a guy. There's no time to read "Make Out Paradise." What? I?! That's right! I saw Sasuke on the verge of dying and I... Sasuke! Don't die and leave me here!! Where are you?! So that's what it looks like behind the logs. Oh! There are box lunches on the stone! A Ninja must see through deception... eh? Well! I'll acknowledge that you're different from those two. Horse! Tiger! Fire Style! Fireball Jutsu! What?! That's not a Jutsu that a Genin can do... He shouldn't have enough Chakra yet! He's gone! Is he behind me?! No, above me?! Where is he?! I'm under you!! Wha?! Earth Style: Headhunter Jutsu. Shinobi Battle Skill #3, Ninjutsu. How's that? You can't move, heh? Although, you're... already starting to make your mark. But, oh well. They do say that the nail that sticks up gets hammered down, so... Damn it! I don't have to naively take those bells. I'll just eat in secret right now! Let's eat!! Hey. I was just joking... Too late! Damn it! Is there this much of a difference in strength? Sakura... This time it's a freshly severed head?! What's up with her? Sasuke? You're okay! Hey, cut it out! Don't cling to me! There's not much time left until noon. I'm going. Sasuke, you're still going after the bells?! I was able to touch them last time. Next time I'll be able to take them. What?! I I see. Sure enough, you're awesome, Sasuke. There's no way I can take the bells from Sensei. At this rate, I'll face separation from Sasuke... Uh... say. There's really no time left... So let's just take it easy and try again next time. I'm the only one who can kill that man. Huh? What? You mean Sensei? At that time... I was crying. Crying? My... What? What is it? I'm an avenger. I must become stronger than that man... I don't have time for setbacks here... ... to kill a certain man! Damn it... I wasted my time talking. Sasuke... Oh oh, your stomachs are growling... By the way, about this exercise... Well! There's no need for you guys to go back to the Academy. What? I... All I did was lay unconscious. Is that okay? Love is victorious!! Cha!! Yahooooo! Then, then! That means the three of us... Yes. The three of you... must quit being Ninja!! N No way! Kakashi hasn't passed a single person this whole time... Iruka... Even I don't know if it's good for those kids to become Shinobi right away... However... Kakashi's judgments were correct... Quit being Ninja?! What do you mean?! Uh, well it's true, we weren't able to take the bells. But why do we have to be told to "quit"?! That's because you're all squirts who don't have the qualifications to become Ninja. Oh! Sasuke! I'm saying you're squirts. Don't step on Sasuke!! Are you kids thinking that being a Ninja is easy? Huh? Why do you think you're doing this exercise in teams? Huh?! What do you mean? Put simply... it's as if you guys have no understanding of the answer to this test. Answer? Yes. The answer that determines passing or failing of this test. That's... what I've wanted to ask about for a while now. Man, are you guys brainless or what? Don't you get the meaning of the three-man squad?! Jeez!! What of three people to a squad?! That's... teamwork! You mean, working together? Exactly. But it's too late even if you realize that now. You might've been able to... take the bells if the three of you had come at me... Well, it's too bad. Now wait a minute. Why use teamwork if there were only two bells? If the three of us were to desperately go take the bells with one having to hold back, that wouldn't be teamwork. That'd create internal discord. Of course! This is a test set up to purposely place you against each other. It's under just such conditions where one's own interests aren't the issue. The intention was to select those who could prioritize teamwork... Despite this, you fools... Sakura! You were only concerned with Sasuke and you didn't even know where he was. And you didn't care for Naruto who was right in front of your eyes... Naruto! All you do is run solo... You labeled the other two as hindrances and acted on your own... Missions are carried out in squads! There's no mistaking that Ninjas need unsurpassed individual skills... But "teamwork" is considered more important than that. Individual actions that disrupt teamwork throw the team into crisis and lead to death... For example... "Sakura! Kill Naruto, or else Sasuke dies..." What?! What?! Whaaat?! Is what will... happen. Oh, I was so surpised. On top of having a hostage taken, you're faced with two impossible choices and end up being killed. Every mission is a life risking assignment. Look at this... The many names engraved on this stone... These are all Ninjas who are called heroes in the village. That that that that! I like thaaat! I've decided now to get my name engraved there, too! A hero! A hero! I'm not going to die like a dog! But... they're not just ordinary heroes. No kidding. Then, what kind of heroes are they? Hey! Hey! They are heroes who were killed in action. Killed in action? It means they died performing a mission. This is a memorial. The names of my friends are also engraved here... I'll give you guys one more chance! However, after noon it'll be a harsher battle to take the bell. Those who want to take on the challenge can eat lunch. However, don't let Naruto have any. It's punishment for breaking the rules and attempting to eat lunch on your own. If someone lets him eat... that person will be disqualified on the spot. I make the rules, here. Got it?! I must be going. Listen to me, Iruka. What? No matter what the result, don't hold it against Kakashi... Alright. I'm okay with not eating lunch! No sweat at all! No sweat... Here. H Hey, Sasuke. Sensei just said! It's okay. There's no sign of him now. The three of us are going to go take the bells together. It'll be trouble for me if he becomes a hindrance, so... Sasuke... Sakura... Thanks... Don't thank me. Just hurry up and eat. But... I'm on... a diet... I mean I just eat less than Sasuke. So you don't need to worry. But... See... Wha?! Hurry it up. We don't know when he'll be back... It's just this one time. Okay? You got it?! I got it. You three! Yiiikes! You defied the rules so that means you know what's coming... Do you have... something to say? But you see... What?! But! But! But! You said, Sensei! These guys... We're a three man squad, right? That's right! The three of us are one, so! That's right! That's right! That's right! That's right! The three of you are one, eh... You pass! What?! Whaaat?! You pass! We passed?! Why?! You guys are the first. Up until now, it was always just dunces who would meekly listen to what I said. A Ninja must see through deception... In the world of Ninja, those who break rules and codes are branded as garbage... But... Those who don't cherish their friends are garbage worse than that. He's... He's... kinda... cool... That's it for the exercise... Everyone passes! Group Seven starts their mission tomorrow! Yes, Sir! I did it!! I'm a Ninja! Ninja! Ninja! Let's go home. Cha! I... knew this is how it'd turn out! Untie the rope! Oh, please! It'd been nothing but blah missions until now. And just when I thought I'd finally gotten an awesome mission, to think it'd be bodyguarding this old man. He mocks the heck out of me, calling me a brat. I'll tell him a thing or two. Someday I'll be... Hey, are you listening?! Next episode: "A Dangerous Mission! Journey to the Land of Waves!" Don't miss me kick butt!
