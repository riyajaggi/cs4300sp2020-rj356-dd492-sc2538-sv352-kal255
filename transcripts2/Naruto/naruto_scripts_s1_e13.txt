   C'mon! Running like a fugitive, Being chased by something Inside my heart is pounding My throat dry like it's withering For no single one, To none does belong, This time is ours, right now... Unraveling the pain, Unraveling our hearts, Unraveling shadows Stifling our breath, Reaching for beyond, Tearing through the dark In fighting and in love To the distant light above, Yes, we are on the way I wanna rock... Rockin' my heart Inari! Give me a hand. I'll be right there. This mist... Sasuke! Sakura! They're coming! I knew he was still alive. Making an appearance so soon, eh... Say, Kakashi Sensei. This is his... Hidden Mist Jutsu, right?! Sorry to have kept you waiting, Kakashi. I see you've got those brats with you as always. He's still trembling. Poor thing. I'm trembling with... excitement. Do it, Sasuke. I can see him! Well, well. So you discerned the Water Doppelganger Jutsu. That brat's grown quite a bit. This means a rival has emerged, Haku. So it seems. Damn it! I'm totally late! Well, well... It seems my prediction was right on the money. Prediction? That little mask... Oh! I knew it... Heh! So the Elite Shinobi of the Hidden Mist thing was a bald faced lie! No matter how you look at him, he's gotta be a comrade of Zabuza. Standing together with him and all... How dare he show up like that after what he did! I hate brats who think they're so cool... He's better than you, Kakashi Sensei. Oh... really? I'll do it. Huh? With his bad acting... I hate brats who think they're so cool! Sasuke, you are so cool! That Sakura doesn't take stabs at Sasuke... He's an impressive youth. Hmm... Even though those Water Clones have only 1/10th the strength of their original... To think he went that well. However, you made the preemptive move. Go! Right! What?! Haku's Secret Jutsu. Crystal Ice Mirrors Are you Tazuna's daughter? Sorry, but you're coming with us. Mom! Don't come out! Get out of here, quick! What's with you, brat?! Shall we take him, too? One hostage is fine. Hostage...?! Then... Shall we kill him? Wait! If you lay a hand on that child... I'll bite off my tongue and kill myself! You want a hostage, right? Thank your mom, kid. Oh, man... It's not enough... Knock it off. You just tried out your sword earlier. Forget it already and let's take the woman. Mom, I'm sorry... I'm so sorry! I'm weak, so I can't protect you... I don't want to die... I'm scared! You crybaby... So you're just gonna cry all day like the lead in a tragedy? An idiot like you can just cry forever! You crybaby! He's probably tired of crying. So, he knows the true meaning of the word strong. Like your father. For the things I truly hold dear to myself... I protect them until the end with both these arms, even if it looks like I might lose my life! Inari... Can I... can I also become strong...? Dad! Looking at that beautiful skin of yours makes me want to cut you. Hey... walk faster. Wait! Inari! What? It's just the kid from before. Get... get away from my mom! Man... This brat's hopeless. Let's do it! If you do that, I'll bite off my tongue and Shut up. Go to sleep. I... na... ri. Well, well... He can see that speed, eh... Yes... Sakura, surround Tazuna and don't move away from me. Let Sasuke handle him! Okay. I don't want to have to kill you... I'd like for you to back down. Nonsense... I knew it... But you won't be able to keep up with my speed. Also, I've already made two preemptive moves. Two preemptive moves? The first one is the scattered water. And the second one was blocking one of your hands... Therefore, you'll just be able to defend my attack... What?! With one hand he's...?! A one handed Sign? I've never seen such a thing before... A Thousand Needles of Death! So he doesn't want to kill him... eh. I wonder if that's how he really feels... Sasuke! Remember...that training... Build up Chakra at one burst... The Substitution Jutsu...?! The woman... Hmm? Sorry I was late. Heroes usually appear on the scene late, so... Naruto! Inari, you did well! Huh? Thanks to you distracting them, I was able to save your mom. Naruto... how did you know that those samurai were here? In the forest, there was a boar that had been cut up with a sword. Other than that, there were trees with lots of cuts. They headed in the direction of your house... so I got worried. I see. Well... If it isn't the no good Ninja that Tazuna hired... Let's do it... Yeah... Here they come! Hah! Something like that won't work! Fools. Prepare yourself! W-Wow...! It's done! Naruto, you're just like... a Ninja! You fool. I was a Ninja to start with! Build up Chakra at one burst... to the feet! He vanished... You're surprisingly stupid... From here on... you'll only defend my attack! To think Haku would lose in speed... It seems that I'm faster than you... I can't have you mocking our team, calling them brats... He may not look it, but Sasuke is the number one rookie of the Village Hidden in the Leaves. And Sakura is our sharpest... Hah! Serves you right! And the other one is the number one hyperactive, knucklehead Ninja, Naruto Uzumaki. You have a cold? I'm okay. Anyway... Sorry about yesterday, Inari. Huh? Branding you a crybaby... Forget I ever said that. You're strong! Dang it! I... decided never to cry again, but... Now you'll laugh at me again and call me a crybaby. What're you saying...?! It's okay... when you're happy. It's okay to cry when you're happy! Naruto... Now then. I can leave the rest to you, right? Yeah... Okay, I'm going to hop over to the bridge for a bit. Man, it's tough being a hero! That's for sure! Haku, do you know what this means? At this rate, you'll be defeated by your intended victim... Yes... What...? It's unfortunate... Is this... cold air...? Hidden Jutsu! Crystal Ice Mirrors! What is it? What's that Jutsu? Are these... mirrors?! What... in the world...?! Damn it! I'm your opponent, aren't I? Since that Jutsu has appeared... he's done for. Now then... I'll start. I shall show you... my true speed! Sasuke! Sasuke! If you make a move, I'll kill those two!! I'm sorry, Tazuna! I'm stepping away from here for a bit. Sure. Go! Sakura! Sasuke! Take this! He caught it?! What?! Who is it?! It's that idiot...that showoff... The number one hyperactive, knucklehead Ninja... Naruto Uzumaki... is finally here! Naruto Uzumaki is finally here! It'll be okay. Now that the hero of the story has appeared, I'll smash those stupid funny looking mirrors in no time... Huh? Why won't mirrors made of ice break? Why won't they melt? What the heck is going on here?! Next episode: "The Number One Hyperactive Knucklehead Ninja Joins the Fight!" As for me, will I be able to kick butt once again?
