 IN ALASKA... HOLY **** THICK SNOW... WE GOT A PROBLEM HERE. JESUS, WE JUST DERAILED THE HANDLE CAR. ...AND RECKLESS DRIVERS... HEY! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! PUT THE LIVES OF RAIL CREW ON THE LINE... I DO NOT LIKE IT WHEN THINGS GO WRONG. ...AND LEAVE REMOTE SETTLERS IN DANGER. ONE SCREW-UP AND YOU'RE DEAD.

 IF WE DO MISS THE TRAIN, IT'LL BE DEFINITELY A BAD THING. THE PORT OF WHITTIER... ...BUILT AS A SECRET MILITARY BASE DURING WORLD WAR II, ITS DEEP WATER REMAINS ICE-FREE DURING ALASKA'S HARSH WINTERS, ALLOWING CRUCIAL CARGO TO DOCK AT THE RAILHEAD. BARGES CARRYING CRITICAL GOODS FOR THE STATE'S NORTHERN BUSINESSES AND SETTLERS ARRIVE HERE DAILY. WE'RE IN PLACE. WE'RE ALL LINED UP. IT'S 8:00 A.M. OVERNIGHT, A BLIZZARD HAS BURIED THE PORT'S TRACKS IN MORE THAN A FOOT OF SNOW. RAIL CREW DANNY AND ANIMAL MUST CLEAR IT FAST, SO THEY CAN UNLOAD THESE FREIGHT CARS OFF THE BARGE

 AND BUILD A TRAIN. RIGHT NOW, THE TRACKS ARE KIND OF BURIED, SO WE'RE KIND OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THE HECK WE ARE. SURE BE NICE IF IT WAS CLEAN, THEN WE'D KNOW. UNDERNEATH THE SNOW IS A LAYER OF ICE. IT IS SLIPPERY AS CAN BE. WELL, WE'LL JUST DEAL WITH IT. THEY'RE USING EVERY WEAPON IN THEIR ARSENAL TO ATTACK THE PROBLEM, INCLUDING THIS MILITARY JET ENGINE, WHICH HAS BEEN RE-ENGINEERED INTO A POWERFUL SNOWBLOWER. OKAY, GUYS. WE'LL GET STARTED ON THIS BRIEFING HERE. WE'VE ALREADY HAD A FOOT OF SNOW DUMPED ON US WITH THIS STORM THIS MORNING. THEY'RE CALLING FOR 6-12 MORE INCHES, SO WE NEED TO GET THIS FREIGHT OUT OF HERE SO IT DOESN'T GET DRIFTED IN. WHAT KIND OF HOT LOADS WE GOT ON THIS TRAIN TODAY? WE GOT THIS HEAVY EQUIPMENT FOR ANCHORAGE AND TWO MILITARY HOT LOADS THAT ARE HOTTER THAN THE HUBS OF HELL. THESE MOBILE RADAR UNITS NEED DELIVERING TO ELMENDORF AIR FORCE BASE IN ANCHORAGE. THERE ARE NINE MILITARY BASES IN ALASKA, HOME TO 22,000 PERSONNEL. THEY'RE A CRUCIAL PART OF THE COUNTRY'S DEFENSES. Okay, here we go. ADD 3,000 ON, LET'S BRING 'EM ON BACK. OKAY, ROGER. BACK. THE RAILROAD'S INCOME IS DOWN $12 MILLION ON LAST YEAR. IT'S CRUCIAL THAT THE CREW DELIVER MULTIMILLION-DOLLAR CONTRACTS, LIKE THESE MILITARY CARGOS, ON TIME AND WITHOUT A SCRATCH. JOBS ARE ON THE LINE. THIS KIND OF WORK EITHER KEEPS YOU YOUNG OR IT KILLS YOU. IF YOU DON'T ENJOY IT, THEN DON'T DO IT. THE BAD WEATHER BRINGS EXTRA HAZARDS. DANNY AND ANIMAL MUST TRAVEL 60 MILES FROM THE PORT OF WHITTIER THROUGH THE CHUGACH MOUNTAINS. DEEP SNOW ENCOURAGES SNOWMACHINERS TO DRIVE DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO THE RAILS HERE, WHERE THE SNOW HAS BEEN PLOWED CLEAR. ICE ON THE SEWARD HIGHWAY CAN ALSO CAUSE DRIVERS TO CRASH THEIR CARS ONTO THE TRACKS. THEY NEED TO REACH ANCHORAGE BY 6:00 P.M. WE DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER RAIL LINES CONNECTED TO THE STATE OF ALASKA. WE'RE ISOLATED FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD. SO TO SPEAK, THE BASTARD STEPCHILD, THAT'S WHAT WE ARE. SO, EVERYTHING THAT WE GET COMES IN THROUGH BARGES. TO PULL THE FREIGHT CARS OFF THE BARGE ONTO THE MAIN LINE, THE CREW USE A SPECIAL WAGON CALLED A HANDLE CAR PULLED BY TWO LOCOMOTIVES. WHOA! STOP! CENTER. WE JUST DERAILED THE HANDLE CAR IN SOME ICE. HOW THE HELL DID THAT HAPPEN? WHEN THEY WERE MAKING THEIR SHOVE, IT JUST PICKED SOME ICE AND IT WALKED OFF THE RAIL. BE A FEW MINUTES. All right. Got you loud and clear. THE KEY IS TO STOP BEFORE ANY MORE DAMAGE IS DONE, AND THEN DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO GET IT RERAILED. I DO NOT LIKE IT WHEN THINGS GO WRONG. I GOT TO PICK UP SOME CHAIN HERE. WE'RE GONNA LAY IT ON THE GROUND AND SEE IF WE CAN GET THOSE WHEELS TO RIDE UP, BACK UP ON THE RAILS. THE CHAIN WILL SIT ON TOP OF THE ICE AND LET THE WHEEL CLIMB UP, AND THEN IT CAN FALL INTO PLACE. WHEN WE'RE GONNA MOVE, WE ALL HAVE TO BE CLEAR. RIGHT. Hang tough here. We're just about there. IT'S ALL GONNA HAPPEN RIGHT NOW, REAL QUICKLY. ALL RIGHT. HERE WE GO. 30-09, OVER. START 'EM AHEAD EASY. EASY. EASY! WE'RE DAMN NEAR THERE. A LITTLE MORE. ALL RIGHT. NICELY DONE. IT TAKES 40 MINUTES TO GET THE HANDLE CAR BACK ONTO THE TRACKS SO THEY CAN START BUILDING THEIR FREIGHT TRAIN. THANK YOU. WE'RE BACK IN BUSINESS HERE. THAT WAS A CLOSE CALL. 200 MILES NORTH... ...IN THE SHADOW OF NORTH AMERICA'S LARGEST MOUNTAIN, MOUNT McKINLEY, THE RAILROAD OFFERS THE ONLY LINK TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD FOR OFF-GRIDDERS AMANDA AND KENNY SIMPSON. DANG. THAT AIN'T COMING OUT. GOOD JOB. THE COUPLE LIVE 30 MILES FROM THE NEAREST TOWN, TALKEETNA, WITH THEIR NEWBORN SON, KINLEY. IT LOOKS STRANGE TO HAVE A BABY BED IN HERE. IT FEELS MORE LIKE A HOME NOW THAT THE BABY'S HERE. YEAH. MY WIFE AND I HAD A BABY FIVE WEEKS AGO. IT'S JUST DIFFERENT. NOW THERE'S THREE OF US. ALREADY, THIS LITTLE DUDE HAS MORE THAN I EVER DID. HE'S GOT A MOTHER THAT LOVES TO BE OUT IN THE WOODS AND SHE'S GOT SO MANY SKILLS. IT'S RIDICULOUS. AND HE'S GOT A FATHER THAT ENJOYS BUILDING STUFF AND FEELING ACCOMPLISHED IN KNOWING THAT HIS FAMILY DOESN'T HAVE TO WANT FOR ANYTHING. I THINK ONE OF THE POSITIVE SIDES OF LIVING OFF-GRID, IT SHOWS THAT LIFE CAN BE SIMPLER IF YOU WANT IT TO BE. KENNY AND I HAVE CHOSE THAT LIFE FOR OUR SON. IF YOU TEACH THEM THE SIMPLER PART OF LIFE, THEY KNOW THEY HAVE THAT CHOICE... TO HAVE LIFE SIMPLE OR EXTREMELY COMPLICATED. CRAZY TO ME IS LIVING THE RAT RACE THAT HAPPENS IN CITIES ALL OVER THE WORLD. THAT'S CRAZY TO ME. I'M NOT CRAZY. THEY'RE CRAZY. OUR CABIN OFF-GRID IS VERY SIMPLE. IT IS MADE OUT OF JUST LOGS. IT HAS A KITCHEN, LIVING ROOM, BEDROOM. WE DON'T HAVE RESTROOMS IN OUR HOUSE. WE HAVE OUTHOUSES, AND YOU GO OUTSIDE. THEY'RE JUST HOLES IN THE GROUND WITH SHELTERS OVER THEM. I MEAN, I POOP IN A HOLE IN THE GROUND, BUT I GOT IT GOING ON, YOU KNOW. TODAY, KINLEY IS DUE FOR HIS FIRST CHECKUP AT THE DOCTORS IN WASILLA. IS THAT YUMMY? KENNY WORRIES MORE THAN I DO ABOUT THINGS, BUT IT'S KIND OF NATURAL. YES, I DO WORRY ABOUT KINLEY GETTING SICK. MOST PEOPLE WOULDN'T HAVE CONFIDENCE, YOU KNOW, IN THEMSELVES TO HAVE A NEWBORN WAY OUT HERE IN THE WOODS. NATURE CAN THROW SO MANY THINGS AT YOU. TO REACH WASILLA, THEY MUST CATCH THE PASSENGER TRAIN. IT'S 9:00 A.M. THE COUPLE WILL HAVE TO SNOWMACHINE 2 MILES FROM THEIR CABIN THROUGH WOODS HEAVILY POPULATED BY MOOSE THAT CAN ATTACK TO FLAG DOWN THE PASSENGER TRAIN. IT WILL THEN TAKE ABOUT 90 MINUTES TO REACH WASILLA. WE'RE GONNA CATCH THE TRAIN INTO WASILLA FOR BABY'S APPOINTMENT, AND HOPEFULLY GET SOME OTHER ERRANDS TAKEN CARE OF WHILE WE'RE IN TOWN. **** ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? YEAH. AND THE BABY'S FINE. YOU MADE A MESS ALL OVER YOUR FACE. IN THE RUSH TO STOP AND CLEAR SNOW THAT FELL ON KINLEY'S FACE, AMANDA HAS STALLED THE COUPLE'S ONLY SNOWMACHINE. HURRY UP. ISOLATED 30 MILES FROM HELP, THEY NEED TO START IT FAST. THAT'S NOT GOOD. IS THERE GAS IN THIS MACHINE? THEY'RE STRANDED IN AN AREA KNOWN AS ALASKA'S BERMUDA TRIANGLE. DUE TO THE EXTREME TERRAIN, BAD WEATHER, AND FREEZING TEMPERATURES, MORE PEOPLE GET LOST AND DIE HERE THAN IN ANY OTHER PART OF THE STATE. **** I THINK IT'S BROKEN. 30 MILES FROM THE NEAREST TOWN, TALKEETNA... WANTS TO GO NOW. ...OFF-GRIDDERS KENNY AND AMANDA AND THEIR 5-WEEK-OLD SON, KINLEY, ARE STRANDED IN THE ALASKAN WILDERNESS. IF YOUR SNOWMACHINE BREAKS DOWN ON THE TRAIL, YOU GOT TO FIGURE OUT WHETHER OR NOT YOU SHOULD LEAVE IT THERE AND WALK. WHEN YOU'RE WALKING, YOU'RE MORE VULNERABLE. IT'S A DANGEROUS PLACE. **** THERE YOU GO. I GOT IT. AFTER 20 MINUTES, THE MACHINE FINALLY RESTARTS. THEY MUST STILL RACE ONE MILE TO CATCH THE WEEKLY PASSENGER TRAIN, SO THEY CAN TAKE THEIR SON TO HIS DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT IN WASILLA. IF WE DO MISS THE TRAIN, WE WASTED ALL OF THIS TIME AND ENERGY. IT WOULD BE A BAD THING, DEFINITELY A BAD THING. 40 MILES NORTH, AT CURRY... ...ROADMASTER HUGH EVANS AND HIS CREW ARE WORKING AS FAST AS THEY CAN, CLEARING SNOW TO ALLOW THE PASSENGER TRAIN THROUGH. LAST YEAR, MORE THAN 10 FEET OF SNOW FELL ON THE LINE. HELLO, KYLE. OVER. KYLE TO YOU. OVER. YEAH, KYLE, LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE PUSHING QUITE A BIT OF SNOW. HOW'S IT GOING? OVER. I'M PRETTY SURE IT'LL BE MORE SNOW WHEN WE GET DOWN OVER THE HILL. OVER. YEAH, JUST TAKE YOUR TIME THERE, AND DON'T GET IN A RUSH, THERE, PLEASE. OVER. ROGER THAT. HOLY **** WE GOT A PROBLEM HERE. THE PROBLEM WE HAVE HERE IS THE SLIDES ARE COMING DOWN. ANY SNOW THAT COMES OFF THE HILLS COMES RIGHT INTO THE TRACK, SO, YEAH, WE GOT A POTENTIAL PROBLEM OF NOT BEING ABLE TO GET TRAIN TRAFFIC THROUGH HERE. LAST NIGHT'S HEAVY SNOWFALL HAS TURNED THIS AREA OF STEEP CLIFFS INTO A DANGEROUS AVALANCHE ZONE. SOME SNOW HAS ALREADY FALLEN ONTO THE TRACK, BUT THERE'S A RISK THAT TONS MORE COULD SLIDE DOWN WITHOUT WARNING, BURYING TRACKS AND TRAINS. ALL RIGHT. EXCAVATOR'S STUCK UP NORTH DIGGING ICE, SO WE'RE TRYING TO EXPERIMENT TODAY, HERE. WE'LL TAKE THE BACKHOE AND WE'LL DIG THE CUT OUT, TAKE AND TRANSFER IT OVER ONTO THE MAIN. YOU'LL TAKE THE REGULATOR, KYLE, AND TRANSPORT THE REST OF THE WAY OVER, IF YOU WOULD PLEASE. WE'RE JUST GONNA SEE IF IT WORKS. BEFORE THE PASSENGER TRAIN ARRIVES, HUGH WANTS HIS CREW TO CLEAR THE TRACK AND THEN DIG OUT THE DITCH UNDERNEATH THE ROCK FACE, MAKING SPACE IF MORE AVALANCHES FALL. NORMALLY, WE DO IT WITH AN EXCAVATOR, DIGS IT OUT, SWINGS IT ACROSS. HUGH'S ONLY EXCAVATOR IS BEING USED TO CLEAR ANOTHER SECTION OF TRACK. HE'LL HAVE TO USE A BACKHOE DIGGER INSTEAD. WHAT ARE YOU THINKING, MIKE? I THINK THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT OUR SAFETY HERE, YOU KNOW. THE DANGER OF GETTING THE BACKHOE STUCK. OBVIOUSLY, WE DON'T WANT ANYTHING FALLING DOWN ON US, SO MAYBE ANTHONY CAN BE OUT HERE... YEAH, WATCHING IT. SPOTTING FOR ME. HEY, LET'S GO AHEAD AND GET THIS OVER WITH. MIKE THINKS THEY SHOULD USE THE BACKHOE TO CLEAR THE SNOW FROM THE TRACKS AND THEN WAIT UNTIL THE EXCAVATOR IS FREE TO DIG OUT THE DITCH. THIS IS JUST NOT GONNA WORK. HE'S WORRIED THAT THE WHEELS ON HIS BACKHOE WILL GET STUCK IN SNOW, STRANDING HIM RIGHT UNDER THE DANGER ZONE. YOU KNOW, WORKING WITH HUGH, I CAN TELL HIM WHAT I THINK OF HIS IDEAS AND HE DOESN'T TAKE IT PERSONAL. COME ON UP, COME ON UP. MIKE'S FATHER IS A LOCOMOTIVE ENGINEER FOR THE RAILROAD. MIKE FOLLOWED IN HIS FOOTSTEPS. NOW A FOREMAN, HE OFTEN WORKS UNSUPERVISED, BUT TODAY, HUGH IS IN CHARGE, AND THE CREW WILL STICK WITH HIS PLAN. THE LONGER YOU SPEND UNDER THIS ROCK FACE, THE WORST, POSSIBLY, THINGS COULD HAPPEN. KYLE KEEPS AN EYE ON THE ROCK FACE TO WATCH OUT FOR ANY FURTHER SNOW MOVEMENT. IN 2000, A RAILROAD WORKER WAS KILLED WHEN AN AVALANCHE HIT HIS DOZER. PRETTY SKETCHY AREA. THERE'S A DANGER THAT ROCKS CAN COME DOWN. IT'S NOT A GOOD SPOT TO BE SCREWING AROUND IN. **** DAMN IT. I THINK THE DITCH MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT TOO STEEP. MY TIRES ARE STARTING TO DROP IN. THE BACK END'S TRYING TO GO DOWNHILL. TURN YOUR BUCKET UP, TURN YOUR BUCKET UP. IT'S NO USE, HUGH. I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE. I'M STUCK. **** 15 MILES SOUTH, NEAR TALKEETNA... ...66-YEAR-OLD STEVE DURR AND HIS 54-YEAR-OLD BROTHER, JONATHON, ARE OFF-GRID BACHELORS WHO TOOK THE PASSENGER TRAIN TO THIS REMOTE REGION 40 YEARS AGO AND NEVER LOOKED BACK. I LIVE OUT HERE ON THIS BEAUTIFUL LAKE ABOUT 10 MILES NORTH OF THE VILLAGE OF TALKEETNA, CAME UP HERE IN 1970 WITH MY DAD. HE WAS INTRIGUED BY THE IDEA OF LIVING CLOSER TO THE LAND, CLOSER TO NATURE, AND AWAY FROM THE... THERE'S NO OTHER WAY TO SAY IT, AWAY FROM THE MADNESS. MY BROTHER JONATHON LIVES ACROSS THE LAKE. I REALLY DON'T SEE IT AS BEING CUT OFF FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD. I... THIS IS THE ULTIMATE FREEDOM. LAST NIGHT'S BLIZZARD HAS DEVASTATED ONE OF THEIR OUTBUILDINGS, THEIR LATE FATHER'S OLD HOME. ITS ROOF IS BUCKLING UNDER THE WEIGHT OF 2 FEET OF SNOW, AND IT'S CLOSE TO COLLAPSE. YEAH, SHE'S PRETTY COMPACTED. I LIVED IN THIS CABIN FOR ABOUT 10 YEARS. THIS WAS A REAL GOOD CABIN. OUR DAD BUILT THIS. ME AND JOHN HELPED SOME, BUT IT WAS MOSTLY HIM JUST UP HERE BY HIMSELF. IT'S A GOOD LITTLE BACHELOR CABIN. THIS WAS ORIGINALLY A GOOD ROOF. EVEN THOUGH IT'S DAMAGED, IT'S STILL SUPPORTING A WHOLE LOT OF WEIGHT WITH THE SNOW, BUT EVENTUALLY, ROOFS GIVE OUT. THEY CAVE IN. THE BROTHERS HAVE ORDERED 10 SHEETS OF PLYWOOD AND SIX RAFTERS FROM A SUPPLIER IN ANCHORAGE TO MAKE URGENT REPAIRS. IT'S BEING LOADED ONTO THE RAILROAD'S DELIVERY VEHICLE... THE TUNDRA TRUCK. IT'S THEIR ONLY LIFELINE. IT'S THE ONLY WAY THEY'RE GETTING THE BUILDING MATERIALS AND FUEL, UNLESS THEY WANT TO SNOWMACHINE DOWN THE TRACKS, WHICH IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS, SO... THIS IS WHY WE PROVIDE THIS SERVICE FOR 'EM. MAN. THAT FIBERGLASS IS ROTTED. AND WE GOT A BAD RAFTER THERE, BAD ONE HERE. WE GOT TO GET RID OF ALL OF THIS STUFF. I KNEW IT WAS BAD. I KNEW IT WAS BAD. WE COULD GET 4 FEET OF SNOW TOMORROW. THE ROOF IS IN A MUCH WORSE STATE THAN THEY THOUGHT. THEY MUST REPLACE IT BEFORE TONIGHT'S SNOWSTORM WRECKS THE CABIN BEYOND REPAIR. THE TUNDRA'S COMING AT HALF 10, SO WE SHOULD BE THERE TO GET THE LUMBER. IT'S 10:00 A.M. THE TUNDRA TRUCK IS SCHEDULED TO TRAVEL SOUTH FROM HURRICANE AND SHOULD DROP OFF THE LUMBER SUPPLIES AT CHASE. THE BROTHERS WILL NEED TO GET DOWN TO THE RAILROAD TO PICK IT UP. COME ON. THE BIGGEST DANGER IS ALWAYS WEATHER. ALASKA IS SO CRUEL AND UNFORGIVING. ONE SCREW-UP AND YOU'RE DEAD. I ALMOST LOST THIS FINGER THIS WINTER TO FROSTBITE. I'VE BEEN DOING THIS MY WHOLE LIFE. TO GET WHAT YOU NEED, THE MAIN THING YOU HAVE TO DO IS GO WHEN THE CONDITIONS ARE GOOD. IF ALL OF A SUDDEN, WE GET A SNOWSTORM, YOU CAN'T ALWAYS GET OUT WITH YOUR SNOWMOBILE. YOU HAVE TO TRY TO BREAK YOUR TRAILS SO YOU HAVE YOUR ACCESS, AND IF YOU'RE TRAVELING BY SNOWMACHINE AND YOU BREAK DOWN, YOU CAN FREEZE TO DEATH. ONE GUY DIED BECAUSE OF THAT. HE COULDN'T BREAK HIS TRAIL OUT, AND HE JUST GAVE OUT AND DIED ON THE TRAIL. IT'S ABOUT AS GOOD AS IT GETS HERE. WE NEED TO GET THIS ROOF DONE BEFORE ANOTHER HEAVY SNOWSTORM. 15 MILES NORTH, AT CURRY... ...IT'S NO USE, HUGH, I'M NOT GETTING ANYWHERE. MIKE'S BACKHOE DIGGER IS LOSING TRACTION IN THE SOFT SNOW. THIS IS NOT GONNA WORK. JUST GIVE IT A MINUTE HERE. I KNEW THIS WAS GONNA **** HAPPEN. SON OF A **** OKAY, NOW. COME FORWARD. KEEP YOUR BUCKET DOWN. KEEP YOUR BUCKET DOWN. BRING DOWN, BRING IT D... STOP, STOP, STOP. **** DAMN IT. I'M STUCK. THE SOUTHBOUND PASSENGER TRAIN IS LESS THAN 40 MINUTES AWAY. HUGH AND MIKE NEED TO FREE THE DIGGER, CLEAR THE SNOW, AND GET OUT OF THE WAY QUICKLY, OR THE HOLDUP WILL LEAVE AMANDA, KENNY, AND THEIR BABY STRANDED. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. IT AIN'T GONNA WORK. SON OF A **** WE DO NOT NEED TO DELAY ANY TRAINS AT ALL. PEOPLE IN ALASKA ARE DEPENDING ON US. THE PORT OF WHITTIER. 40-09, BACK ONE-HALF CAR LENGTHS TO A HOOK. DANNY AND ANIMAL ARE HOOKING UP THE LAST OF TODAY'S HOT LOADS, BULLDOZERS AND MILITARY MOBILE RADAR UNITS, TO THEIR MILE-LONG FREIGHT TRAIN. THAT'LL DO, 40-09, THAT'LL DO. THEY NEED TO GET GOING TO ANCHORAGE, BEFORE AN INCOMING STORM SNOWS THEM IN. ALL GOOD. HERE WE GO. HAMMER DOWN. LET'S GET OUTTA HERE. THEY WEREN'T GONNA HOLD THIS TUNNEL MUCH LONGER FOR US. IT'S A GAME OF INCHES AND A GAME OF SECONDS. THIS TUNNEL IS 2 1/2 MILES LONG AND PASSES THROUGH THE MAYNARD MOUNTAIN. IT'S THE ONLY ROUTE IN AND OUT OF THE PORT FOR TRAINS AND ROAD VEHICLES. BUILT IN 1943, IT'S THE LONGEST SHARED HIGHWAY AND RAILROAD TUNNEL IN NORTH AMERICA. UNLESS THESE WHEELS ARE TURNING, WE AIN'T MAKING NO MONEY. COMMERCE BE HAPPENING TODAY. DO YOU KNOW WHAT WFO STANDS FOR? WIDE **** OPEN. 20 MILES UP AHEAD, ROADMASTER BRUCE GOUGH IS CHECKING THAT THE TRACK IS SAFE FOR DANNY AND ANIMAL'S FREIGHT TRAIN TO PASS THROUGH. I WONDER WHAT THOSE GUYS ARE DOING DOWN THERE. THAT DOESN'T LOOK RIGHT. HEY! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! THESE GUYS, I BELIEVE, JUST CUT THIS POLE DOWN, AND I TOLD THEM WHAT ARE THEY DOING, AND THEY KIND OF GAVE ME A BUNCH OF LIP. I'M GONNA CHASE 'EM DOWN. THIS SECTION OF TRACK CAN BE EASILY ACCESSED BY SNOWMACHINERS AND RECREATIONAL RIDERS ARE BECOMING A BIG PROBLEM. FLAT AND CLEARED OF SNOW, THE RAILROAD LINE OFFERS THE SNOWMACHINERS A FAST ESCAPE ROUTE, THAT'S IF THEY CAN OUTRUN BRUCE. TRESPASSERS GOING UP AND DOWN THE TRACKS IS A BIG PROBLEM FOR US. SOMETIMES THEY'LL GET ON THE TRACKS BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO GET BACK INTO THE HEAVY SNOWS. DANNY AND ANIMAL'S FREIGHT TRAIN IS HEADING DIRECTLY TOWARDS THE SNOWMACHINERS. A LOADED TRAIN USUALLY TAKES ABOUT A MILE TO STOP. IF THEY'RE STRUCK, USUALLY THE TRAIN WINS, AND CAN BE LETHAL. 200 MILES NORTH, NEAR TALKEETNA, IT'S 10 DEGREES BELOW ZERO. KENNY, AMANDA, AND THEIR BABY, KINLEY, ARE WAITING FOR THE SOUTHBOUND PASSENGER TRAIN. WE'RE HEADED INTO TOWN JUST TO GET HIS DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT OUT OF THE WAY AND GET SOME THINGS, SUCH AS DIAPERS AND WHATNOT. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO BE ORGANIZED, ESPECIALLY ON TRAIN TRIPS. IF WE FORGET SOMETHING, IT'S NOT LIKE WE CAN TURN AROUND. WE JUST NEED TO HAVE OUR DUCKS IN A ROW, I GUESS. AS THE SNOW STARTS TO FALL, THEY COULD BE IN FOR A LONG WAIT IF HUGH'S CREW CAN'T CLEAR THE LINE. ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. WELL, THAT AIN'T GONNA WORK. THEY'RE FIGHTING A LOSING BATTLE WITH THE WRONG MACHINE. MIKE'S DIGGER IS STUCK IN THE DITCH, AND THE PASSENGER TRAIN CAN'T PASS. I MESSED UP. LET'S MAKE SURE IT'S THE ONLY TIME TODAY, OKAY? ALL RIGHT. WE'LL DO PLAN "B." WE'LL GET KYLE COME UP HERE AND PULL YOU OUT. HELLO, KYLE. COME ON UP. JUST PULL HIM OUT HERE. OVER. WE SHOULDN'T BE STUCK. WE'VE MANAGED TO WASTE THE BETTER PART OF AN HOUR GETTING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING DONE. WE GOT A TRAIN THAT'S GONNA BE HERE ANY TIME. WE REALLY GOT TO GET THINGS GOING. YOU GET THAT CHAIN THERE, ANTHONY. I'M GONNA HOOK IT UP HERE. WE GOT TO GET THIS THING OUTTA HERE PRETTY QUICK. ALL RIGHT, KYLE. BACK UP SLOWLY, PLEASE. HERE WE GO. BACK UP. COME ON BACK. COME ON BACK. COME ON BACK, KYLE. THE STAKES CAN BE COSTLY. THE RAILROAD IS UNDER PRESSURE TO STICK TO SCHEDULES TO KEEP CUSTOMERS HAPPY. WITH FALLING PROFITS, JOBS ARE AT RISK. STRAIGHTEN YOUR WHEELS UP, MIKE, STRAIGHTEN 'EM UP, YEAH. YEAH, THERE YOU GO. THAT WAS SUCCESSFUL. YEAH, I'M CLEAR. ALL RIGHT. YOU WERE RIGHT. I'M A BIG MAN. I CAN EAT CROW. GET AS MUCH AS YOU CAN DUG BACK. WE GOT A TRAIN HERE IN ABOUT AN HOUR FROM NOW. OVER. COPY THAT. TRAIN IN AN HOUR. I'LL DO WHAT I CAN. HOPEFULLY, IT DON'T GET STUCK AGAIN. WITH MIKE'S DIGGER REPOSITIONED ON THE TRACK, HE PILES THE SNOW ONTO THE RAILS SO THAT KYLE CAN PUSH IT AWAY WITH HIS PLOW. HOW'S IT WORKING THERE, MICHAEL? SEEMS TO BE DOING PRETTY GOOD. ALL RIGHT, THEN. WE'LL HAVE KYLE WORK THIS. OKAY, I'M GONNA... I'M GONNA PULL FORWARD. ALL RIGHT, KYLE. GO AHEAD. COME ON DOWN. OVER. WE TRIED AN EXPERIMENT TODAY. IT DIDN'T WORK OUT. AND I LEARNED SOMETHING RIGHT ALONG WITH EVERYBODY ELSE DID. GOT THE BANK CUT AWAY, GOT IT PLOWED OUT OF THE WAY SO THE TRAIN CAN GET THROUGH, SO WE'RE GOOD TO GO. WITH THE SNOW CLEAR, THE PASSENGER TRAIN CAN GET THROUGH TO AMANDA AND KENNY, WHO HAVE BEEN WAITING OVER AN HOUR TO TAKE THEIR BABY TO HIS DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT. YEAH, THERE IT IS. WE'VE GOT OUR TRAIN. THE TRAIN IS DEFINITELY A LIFELINE FOR LOTS OF PEOPLE OUT HERE. SOMETIMES YOU NEED TO GET OUT... COME ON, BOYS. ...MAKE A TOWN RUN. SO, IT'S GREAT. IT'S GOOD. HOW'S THAT LITTLE ONE DOING? GOOD. IT'S A CHANCE FOR CONDUCTOR HARRY ROSS TO MEET THE NEWEST AND YOUNGEST OFF-GRIDDER. JUST SLEEPING AWAY. I KNOW. ALL RIGHT. THAT'S GOOD WHEN THEY SLEEP. I KNOW. ALL RIGHT. 200 MILES SOUTH, NEAR THE PORT OF WHITTIER... ...THE RAILROAD IS ON HIGH ALERT. BRUCE IS TRACKING SNOWMACHINERS WHO ARE TRESPASSING ON THE TRACK. HE NEEDS TO GET THEM OUT OF THE WAY BEFORE DANNY AND ANIMAL'S FREIGHT TRAIN, CARRYING THE MILITARY RADARS, CAN PASS THROUGH. WE JUST PICKED UP SNOWMACHINE TRACKS RIGHT NEXT TO THE RAIL, IN SOME CASES IN BETWEEN THE RAIL, SO WE GOT A FEW MACHINERS OUT HERE. DEFINITELY WILL BE KEEPING OUR EYES OPEN. RIDING ON THE TRACKS IS JUST STUPID. WE HAVE ABOUT 7,500 TONS, ABOUT 6,000 FEET OF TRAIN. WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO STOP THIS TRAIN IN WHAT WE WOULD CALL AN EMERGENCY SITUATION, 'CAUSE IT WOULD SHIFT SOME OF THE PRODUCT THAT WE HAVE BACK THERE. AND THE HOT LOADS ARE VERY IMPORTANT, BUT COMPARED TO OUR LIVES, THEY MEAN NOTHING TO ME. UP AHEAD, BRUCE HAS GOT AS CLOSE AS HE CAN TO THE SNOWMACHINERS. THERE'S FOUR SLEDDERS DOWN THERE. YOU KNOW, IT SHOULDN'T HAPPEN. THESE GUYS KNOW THEY'RE WRONG, AND THEY KNEW THAT THERE WAS SOME DISTANCE THERE AND I COULDN'T GET TO 'EM. THEY ESCAPE INTO THE WOODS. THEY GET OUT THERE JUST IN TIME. THERE'S NOT MUCH I CAN DO. ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO. **** THAT'S NOT GOOD. 15 MILES AHEAD, A CAR HAS VEERED OFF THE SEWARD HIGHWAY, CRASHING WITHIN FEET OF THE TRACK. WE'LL HAVE TO STOP OUR TRAIN. 10 MILES NORTH OF TALKEETNA... LIKE THAT WAS REALLY GONNA WORK. IF IT DON'T HAVE MEAT ON IT, HE AIN'T GONNA GO GET IT. OFF-GRID BROTHERS, STEVE AND JONATHON DURR, ARE WAITING BY THE TRACK FOR THE TUNDRA TRUCK TO DELIVER THEIR LUMBER SO THEY CAN FIX THEIR OLD CABIN ROOF. THAT'S NOT THE TUNDRA. MUST BE KIP COMING. OUR NEIGHBOR, KIP, WE'VE BEEN EXPECTING HIM. HE'S GONNA HELP US HAUL SOME LUMBER TODAY. THE BROTHERS HAVE ENLISTED THE HELP OF THEIR NEAREST NEIGHBOR, KIP, WHO IS AN EXPERIENCED CARPENTER. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. THE PROFESSIONAL HELP HAS ARRIVED. GOT ALL MY HAND TOOLS, SO ONCE WE GET THAT NEW PLYWOOD PUT ON THERE... THAT WOULD BE AMAZING. GOOD. I APPRECIATE THE WORK, YOU KNOW? YOU KNOW, SINCE I BEEN UP HERE THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS, EVERYBODY'S KIND OF BEEN HELPING ME OUT, YOU KNOW, STAYING BUSY. WITH ANOTHER SNOWSTORM DUE TO HIT TONIGHT, THE MEN NEED TO GET THE SUPPLIES SOON SO THEY CAN PATCH THE ROOF IN TIME. BUT, 50 MILES NORTH, IN HURRICANE... OKAY, GET OUT OF THE WAY, HERE WE GO. BACKING UP. ...HEAVY SNOW IS MAKING IT TOUGH FOR STEVE MITCHELL TO GET THE TUNDRA TRUCK, LOADED WITH THEIR LUMBER, ONTO THE TRACKS. SON OF A GUN. WE DON'T HAVE ANY TRACTION. THERE'S TOO MUCH SNOW. THIS IS BAD. IF THE TIRES ARE LIFTED UP OFF THE RAIL, THEN I HAVE NO TRACTION AT ALL. WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH 32, 36 BELOW, IT'S A REAL PAIN IN THE ASS. NOTHING WANTS TO MOVE, NOTHING WANTS TO ROLL. IT'S JUST A CONSTANT BATTLE. I'M GONNA BACK UP AGAIN. WATCH YOURSELF. ARE WE IN? YAY. OKAY, TODD. LET'S TRY THAT. OKAY. ALL RIGHT. HERE WE GO. COME ON, BABY. COME ON, BABY. WE GOT IT? WE GOT IT. I THINK WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT. WELL, NOW WE GOT GRAVITY WORKING FOR US. WE JUST WON'T BE ABLE TO STOP, THAT'S ALL. 220 MILES SOUTH, BRUCE IS ON HIS WAY TO THE SCENE OF A REPORTED CAR ACCIDENT. 12-49 TO DOUG. OVER. THANKS, DOUG. OUT. WE'RE TRYING TO ALWAYS EDUCATE PEOPLE ABOUT STAYING OFF OF THE TRACKS. WE'VE HAD A MOTORCYCLE, EARLIER THIS YEAR, THAT LEFT THE ROAD, ENDED UP ON THE TRACKS, AND THE PERSON DIDN'T MAKE IT. KEEP YOUR FINGERS CROSSED EVERYBODY'S OKAY. 80 MILES NORTH, IN WASILLA... ...KENNY AND AMANDA HAVE MADE IT TO THE DOCTOR'S FOR KINLEY'S 5-WEEK CHECKUP. - HI. - HI. GOOD TO SEE YOU GUYS. YOU TOO. THERE'S MY BIG, STRONG MAN. THERE HE IS. - HE'S BREAST-FEEDING? - YEP, YEP. THAT'S GOING WELL? YEAH. HE'S DOING REALLY WELL WITH IT. GREAT. WELL, HE LOOKS LIKE HE'S DOING VERY WELL. OKAY. SO, WE'LL PLAN ON SEEING YOU IN FOUR WEEKS... OKAY, PERFECT. ...FOR NEXT CHECKUP... AND IMMUNIZATIONS. PERFECT. THANK YOU. OKAY. THAT WAS GOOD. HE'S NICE AND HEALTHY. YEP. THAT'S ALWAYS A POSITIVE THING. HEALTHY BABY, CHECK. YEAH. CHECK. MAKES IT MORE COMFORTING, TAKING HIM WAY IN THE WOODS, RIGHT? YEAH. 100 MILES SOUTH, DANNY AND ANIMAL ARE HURDLING TOWARDS ANCHORAGE WITH MORE THAN 7,000 TONS OF HEAVY MACHINERY AND MILITARY RADAR UNITS. WE'RE RIGHT NEXT TO A MAIN HIGHWAY HERE. SOMETIMES, WE HAVE ISSUES WITH CARS. WE'RE GOING THROUGH A LOT OF CURVES AND STUFF LIKE THAT. IT'S HARD TO SEE EVERYTHING. THE LINE RUNS RIGHT NEXT TO THE SEWARD HIGHWAY HERE. IT'S NOTORIOUSLY DANGEROUS. EVERY YEAR, PEOPLE DIE CRASHING THEIR VEHICLES, AND SOMETIMES END UP ON THE TRACKS. I'VE NEVER HIT A VEHICLE, BUT I'VE COME CLOSE. JUST A LITTLE PUSH, AND YOU'D BE OUT OF THE WAY, YOU KNOW, BUT WE'RE STILL READY TO STOP IF NEED BE. YOU SHOULD BE AFRAID OF THE TRAIN. THEY CANNOT STOP ON A DIME AND THEY WILL KILL YOU. BRUCE REACHES THE SITE OF THE CAR CRASH. MY GOD. SOMEBODY DRIVING TOO FAST ON THE DEADLIEST HIGHWAY CAME THROUGH THERE AND OVERTURNED ON HERE. YEP. MISSED THE TRACKS BY 15 OR 20 FEET, SO I DON'T THINK WE... WE'LL LET TRAFFIC GO UNTIL THEY GET THIS CLEAR, 'CAUSE I DON'T WANT TO SEE IT ROLL BACK DOWN. DESPITE THE SEVERE DAMAGE TO THE CAR, THE DRIVER ONLY SUFFERED MINOR INJURIES. **** WE'RE LOOKING FOR THE TRESPASSERS WE GOT ALREADY, GAWKING. **** THEY NEED TO LEAVE. HEY! YOU CAN'T DO THAT! **** AT THE CRASH SITE BY THE TRACKS NEAR ANCHORAGE, BRUCE IS CHASING DOWN TRESPASSERS. THEY THINK THAT THEY CAN HEAR A TRAIN. SOMETIMES THEY CAN'T. THEY'RE PUTTING THEIRSELF IN JEOPARDY WHERE THEY'RE STANDING. GET ON THIS SIDE OF THE TRACKS. WE'RE GONNA HAVE A TRAIN COMING PRETTY SOON. COME ON. WE NEED TO GET A MOVE ON. A TOW TRUCK HAS PULLED THE CAR AWAY FROM THE TRACKS, SO DANNY AND ANIMAL'S FREIGHT TRAIN CAN NOW PASS THROUGH. I DON'T THINK WE'VE DELAYED THE TRAIN TOO BAD, AND NO TRACK DAMAGE. WE'RE FINE. OFF-GRID, NEAR TALKEETNA, TUNDRA TRUCK DRIVER STEVE MITCHELL IS MAKING UP FOR LOST TIME WITH THE DURR BROTHERS' LUMBER DELIVERY. WE GOT SOME WEATHER COMING IN, SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET ALL THIS DONE BEFORE THE WEATHER GETS TOO BAD. LET'S KEEP OUR FINGERS CROSSED, I GUESS. I HEAR THE TUNDRA COMING. THERE'S OUR STUFF. HEY! THANKS FOR BRINGING THAT UP, FELLAS. YOU'RE WELCOME. YOU'RE WELCOME. WE GOT SOME PLYWOOD AND SOME 2x6s UP THERE, I BELIEVE. OKAY. WHATCHA GUYS DOING? REPAIRING A ROOF. I'LL TAKE FIVE OF THOSE HALF-INCH PLYS AND WE'LL GET THE OTHER ONE ON STEVE'S SLED. OKAY. WELL, WE'LL SEE YOU DOWN THE RAIL. ALL RIGHT. KEEP IT ON THE RAILS. YEAH. THAT'S THE MAIN THING. SHOULD HAVE PLENTY OF MATERIALS NOW TO DO THE JOB. IN THE DAYS WHEN WE WERE FIRST COMING OUT HERE TO START THIS WAY OF LIFE, THE RAILROAD WAS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL, AND WE GOT OUR SUPPLIES IN, INCLUDING HOUSEHOLD THINGS LIKE A COOK STOVE AND LUMBER. YEAH, WE PACKED IT ALL IN. THIS WAS BEFORE SNOWMACHINES GOT GOOD. A LOT OF US OUT HERE NOW, WE HAVE SNOWMOBILES. WE USED TO TRAVEL RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE TRACKS, AND THAT DIDN'T ALWAYS WORK OUT SO GOOD. ALL RIGHT. NICE. LET'S SET THESE ASIDE. WE MIGHT NEED THESE FIRST? WE'LL JUST TAKE A LOOK AT THE RAFTERS. I GOT ROT IN THIS ONE. THAT ONE'S GOT TO GO. YEAH, WE GOT TO TAKE EVERYTHING OFF. YEAH. WE'RE GONNA NEED NINE OF 'EM. WE GOT SIX. **** RUNNING A LITTLE SHORT ON MATERIALS. IN WASILLA, AMANDA AND KENNY HAVE MADE IT TO THE STATION JUST IN TIME TO CATCH THE TRAIN HOME. THANK YOU. IF WE MISSED THE TRAIN, WE'D BE SPENDING THE BETTER PART OF A WEEK IN WASILLA, AND THAT WOULD PROBABLY DRIVE US BOTH CRAZY. IN ALL THAT HUSTLE AND BUSTLE, I'M PRETTY SURE I WOULD LOSE MY MIND. WELL, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THIS IS A VERY GOOD PLACE TO KEEP YOUR EYES OUT, LOOKING FOR MOOSE. WE'VE GOT ABOUT FIVE OR SIX ON THE RIGHT-HAND SIDE. DEFINITELY KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN. WE'RE IN MOOSE COUNTRY. WELL, THERE'S THREE, FOUR, FIVE. MY GOD. THERE'S ONE ON THE HILL UP THERE. THERE'S ANOTHER ONE. GEEZ. MORE THAN 200,000 MOOSE ROAM WILD ACROSS ALASKA. THESE 1,200-POUND BEASTS WILL KILL IF PROVOKED. KENNY AND AMANDA MUST BE ON GUARD AS THEY SET OFF THROUGH THE WOODS BACK TO THEIR HOMESTEAD. WHAT YOU DON'T WANT TO DO IS, YOU KNOW, STARTLE A MOOSE. MOOSE WILL TURN A PERSON INTO A MUD PUDDLE PRETTY QUICK. AND THAT'S NOT PRETTY. OFF-GRID AT THEIR TRAILHEAD, KENNY AND AMANDA ARE WRAPPING UP THEIR 5-WEEK-OLD SON, KINLEY, FOR THE SNOWMACHINE TRIP BACK TO THEIR HOMESTEAD. IT'S OKAY, BUBS. IT'S OKAY, BUBS. THEY'VE SPOTTED A HERD OF MOOSE NEARBY. THERE'S A LOT OF MOOSE JUST WANDERING AROUND. YOU CAN'T REALLY STOP THEM FROM WANDERING AROUND. AND THAT IS DANGEROUS. AS LONG AS YOU LEAVE THE MOOSE ALONE, THEY USUALLY DON'T BOTHER YOU. MOOSE DON'T USUALLY LIKE TO MESS WITH A PIECE OF MACHINERY. RIGHT NOW, THE TRAIL'S NOT THE BEST TO HAUL A BUNCH OF HEAVY STUFF HOME, BUT YOU CAN DO IT IF YOU DO SMALL TRIPS. COMING FROM THE CITY TO THE OFF-GRID, IT TAKES US A COUPLE DAYS, WHEN WE GO HOME, TO JUST BE ABLE TO SIT STILL AND RELAX AGAIN. WE DID IT. OVER AT THE DURR BROTHERS' CABIN, WITH TOO FEW NEW RAFTERS TO FIX THE ROOF, THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO IMPROVISE. WE GOT SIX. WE'LL HAVE TO RECYCLE SOME. I GOT THREE THAT ARE USABLE HERE. THAT IS PERFECTO. STEVE'S DAD SAVED IT, AND NOW IT'S A PIECE WE CAN USE 30 YEARS LATER. LITTLE MODIFICATION, BUT IT'LL WORK. ALASKAN INGENUITY TRIUMPHS AGAIN. I LOVE IT WHEN A PLAN COMES TOGETHER. NICE. LAST RAFTER THERE. WANT TO GRAB THAT END, JON, AND JUST THROW IT ON THE ROOF HERE? NICE. LAST NAIL GOING IN. THERE WE ARE, GUYS. READY FOR THE TARP. TODAY WAS A BIG DAY FOR US. WE SAVED A CABIN. WE'RE GOOD. NOW WE'VE GOT IT COVERED, AND THE WEATHER WILL BE KEPT OUT, AND WE CAN RETURN IT TO ITS FORMER GLORY. GOT IN THERE AND TOOK CARE OF IT AND GOT IT DONE. GREAT JOB. DOWN SOUTH, DANNY AND ANIMAL ARE ALMOST HOME WITH THEIR HOT LOAD OF HEAVY MACHINERY AND MILITARY HARDWARE. WE ARE RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO ANCHORAGE. IT FEELS REAL GOOD. WE CAN ONLY WORK 12 HOURS, THAT'S IT. FEDERAL REGULATIONS, THAT'S A FEDERAL LAW. WE GO DEAD AT 6:00. WE ONLY GOT JUST A FEW MORE MINUTES. JOB WELL DONE. THAT WAS A GOOD JOB TODAY, DAN-O. WE JUST BARELY MADE IT. WE DONE GOOD. SQUEAKED IN ON OUR HOURS, BUT, HEY, WE DID GOOD. YEAH. LET'S GO CHECK THEM LOADS. WITH THE RAILROAD'S INCOME DOWN, DANNY AND ANIMAL CAN'T AFFORD TO ROLL UP WITH DAMAGED FREIGHT. THEIR NC CAT, PROBABLY FOR A MINING OPERATION OR SOMETHING UP HERE. YEP. LET'S GO BACK AND CHECK OUT THAT MILITARY STUFF. EVERYTHING'S LOOKING GOOD. LOOKING GOOD SO FAR. YEAH, NOTHING BUSTED UP. GOOD. OUT OF HERE. WE'RE GONNA DO WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO GET THE JOB DONE, BUT WE'RE NOT GONNA DO IT WHERE WE'RE GONNA GET HURT. YOU KNOW, WE WORK WELL. IT'S A COHESION. IT'S A GOOD COHESION, AND THAT'S WHAT THE RAILROAD INDUSTRY IS. IT'S A FAMILY. THE SIMPSON FAMILY ARE CATCHING TONIGHT'S DINNER. DADDY'S GONNA CATCH A FISH. YEAH, BABY. THAT WAS A BIG ONE. DID YOU SEE THAT? I SAW IT FLYING AT ME. I DID NOT SEE ANY FISH. GEEZ. YOU KNOW, I'M PROVIDING A LIFESTYLE FOR MY FAMILY THAT IS WANTED AND NEEDED. YOU HAVE WATER IN NATURE. YOU CAN GO HUNTING IF YOU NEED MEAT. THE ENVIRONMENT PROVIDES YOU WITH EVERYTHING. YOU DON'T REALLY NEED ANYTHING ELSE. YEAH. GOT A FISH? GOT MYSELF RAINBOW TROUT. I'M JUST REALLY FORTUNATE TO HAVE A WIFE THAT LOVES TO BE IN THE WILDERNESS. I'LL JUST WRAP IT IN TINFOIL AND THROW IT ON THE WOOD STOVE. SOUNDS LIKE A DELICIOUS DINNER. JUST ONE.
