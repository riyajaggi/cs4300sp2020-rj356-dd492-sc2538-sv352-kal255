 WHEN I'M OUT HERE BY MYSELF, THERE'S NO ONE TO CALL FOR HELP. WE HAVE AN EMERGENCY HERE. THE KENAI MOUNTAINS, KNOWN FOR THEIR TOWERING GLACIERS AND DEEP CANYONS. THIS IS ONE OF THE ALASKA RAILROAD'S MOST CHALLENGING ROUTES. CLINGING TO THE MOUNTAIN EDGE, THIS SECTION OF RAILROAD WAS THE FIRST TO BE BUILT IN ALASKA. IT TOOK SIX YEARS TO CONSTRUCT JUST 50 MILES OF TRACK HERE, BACK AT THE START OF THE 1900s. OVERNIGHT, THE HEAVIEST SNOWSTORM OF THE WINTER HAS COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN THE RAILROAD. WE'VE HAD A LOT OF SNOW, SIX INCHES HERE, FOUR INCHES HERE, ANOTHER EIGHT INCHES THERE.

 SO IT JUST KEEPS ADDING UP, AND IT JUST WON'T QUIT. IF YOU DON'T LIKE SNOW, THIS AIN'T THE PLACE TO WORK. THE BIGGEST GUN IN THE RAILROAD SNOW-CLEARING ARSENAL IS THE SNOW FLEET, A 67-TON, THREE-QUARTER MILLION DOLLAR SNOWPLOW. ON BOARD ARE DANNY AND ANIMAL. USUALLY THEY BUILD THE TRAINS AND FIX MECHANICAL PROBLEMS, BUT THE STORMS MEAN THAT, TODAY, THEY'LL HAVE TO WORK CLEARING SNOW, TOO, TO GET THE LINE OPEN. THE ROADMASTER AND BRUCE GOUGH CALLED TOWN AND SAID THERE WERE ISSUES ON THE MOUNTAIN. WE AIN'T GOT MUCH TIME. IT'S GONNA TAKE US A LITTLE WHILE TO CLEAN THAT MOUNTAIN FOR HIM, SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GET WITH IT HERE. WE'RE GONNA UNLEASH THE BEAST. WELL, HERE'S THE SITUATION. WE'VE GOT A LOT OF SNOW UP ON THE HILL RIGHT NOW. THE BULLDOZERS ARE STRUGGLING TO GET THROUGH THE SNOW, SO I ONLY HAVE ONE OPTION AT THIS POINT AND THAT'S TO GET THE BIG WINGS. THIS 67-TON PLOW EQUIPPED WITH SPECIAL SNOW SPREADING WINGS IS PUSHED BY TWO LOCOMOTIVES AND HAS A TOP SPEED OF 35 MILES PER HOUR. WE STAY TOTALLY FOCUSED ON WHAT WE'RE DOING. YOU HAVE CROSSINGS, SWITCHES, BRIDGES. THE FRONT PLOW, IF YOU DON'T BRING THAT PLOW UP AT THE RIGHT TIME, IT'LL PICK YOU UP AND THROW YOU OFF THE RAIL. WHAT I LIKE TO HEAR. LET'S PUT A LITTLE EMPHASIS ON THE AVALANCHE. HOW IS EVERYTHING LOOKING UP THERE? NO RECENT ACTIVITY IN AVALANCHE AT ALL, SO WE'RE FINE. GOT YOU. YOU GUYS READY TO DO IT? READY TO GO. LET'S DO IT. THE FREIGHT TRAIN THAT NEEDS TO PASS THROUGH THE SNOWY KENAI MOUNTAINS IS CURRENTLY 50 MILES NORTH IN ANCHORAGE. IT CARRIES 1,600 TONS OF DIESEL FUEL THAT IS URGENTLY NEEDED FOR SHIPS AT THE PORT OF SEWARD. IF THE FREIGHT IS TO MAKE IT THROUGH, DANNY AND ANIMAL MUST CLEAR 20 MILES OF SNOW BLOCKED TRACK FROM PORTAGE, PASSING ACROSS NARROW BRIDGES AND THROUGH TIGHT TUNNELS. THEIR PLOW NEEDS TO BLAST AWAY THE SNOW TO THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN AND THEN PULL OVER INTO A SIDING TO ALLOW THE FUEL TRAIN TO PASS THROUGH TO THE PORT OF SEWARD. ANIMAL TAKES CHARGE OF THE MAIN LOCOMOTIVE ENGINE WHILE BRUCE AND DANNY MAN THE GIANT SNOWPLOW IN FRONT OF IT. RIGHT SIDE IS READY. LEFT SIDE IS READY. FRONT IS READY. WHEN YOU'RE READY, TAKE THEM AHEAD. READY TO ROCK AND ROLL. LET'S CLEAN UP SOME SNOW. THE WINGS OF THE PLOW REACH OUT 40 FEET, TIP TO TIP, TO CUT A WIDE PATH THROUGH THE SNOW. OKAY. RIGHT SIDE COMING OUT. RIGHT SIDE LOCKED. I THINK THIS IS BRUCE'S FAVORITE PART. I THINK HE REALLY LIKES DOING THIS. MAYBE WE'LL NAME IT THE BRUCE SPREADER. OKAY, READY ON THE NOSE. NOSE'S SPEED, 35, 3-5 M-P-H. IT COSTS UP TO $10,000 A DAY TO RUN THE SNOW FLEET. HEAVY SNOW WINTERS ARE EXPENSIVE. LAST YEAR, THE RAILROAD SPENT NEARLY $3 MILLION KEEPING THE TRACKS CLEAR. 200 MILES NORTH IN SHERMAN, 76-YEAR-OLD MARY LOVEL AND HER 84-YEAR-OLD HUSBAND, CLYDE HAVE BEEN LIVING OFF-GRID FOR 49 YEARS. MICE, THEY GOT INTO YOUR BOOTS HANGING FROM THE CEILING. I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY DO IT UP THERE BUT... I DON'T KNOW, EITHER. UNLESS THEY WERE SITTING ON THE FLOOR BEFORE AND... AND THEY GOT HUNG UP. THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN THE CLOSET. I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'D HAVE TO DO TO KEEP THEM OUT OF THE HOUSE. BUILD A NEW HOUSE, A MOUSE PROOF HOUSE. MARY AND CLYDE'S CABIN IS COMPLETELY CUT OFF FROM ROADS, ELECTRICITY AND WATER, AND LAST NIGHT'S SNOWSTORM HAS LEFT THEM TRAPPED. THIS IS MY SNOW BLOWER, WHICH WE PICKED UP A FEW YEARS AGO. IT DOES A GREAT JOB OF GETTING RID OF THAT STUFF. THIS WHOLE ADVENTURE WAS BECAUSE MY HUSBAND, CLYDE, WANTED TO COME TO ALASKA AND HOMESTEAD SOME LAND AND BUILD A HOME FOR HIS FAMILY. AND SOMETIMES WE GET REALLY SICK AND TIRED OF SNOW, BUT HEY, THAT'S ALL PART OF IT. WE THINK SOMETIMES IF PEOPLE WANT TO LIVE IN NEW YORK OR CHICAGO OR L.A., WE THINK THEY'RE CRAZY FOR LIVING... I MEAN, JUST LIKE SARDINES IN A CAN. TO ME, THAT'S NOT THE WAY I WANT TO LIVE. IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GETTING DONE. I NEED MORE WATER IN THERE. ARE YOU GONNA GO GET WATER NOW? YEAH, MIGHT AS WELL. THEN WE WON'T RUN OUT UNTIL TOMORROW, ANYWAY. THE CREEK IS THE ONLY PLACE WE CAN GET ANY WATER RIGHT NOW. EVERY TIME CLYDE'S OUT OF SIGHT OF THE HOUSE, I WORRY ABOUT HIM, WHETHER IT'S CUTTING TREES OR GETTING WATER. IF HE'S DELAYED FOR ANY REASON, I ALWAYS WORRY. WHOA! YOU KNOW, I SUPPOSE WOMEN ALWAYS WORRY. I TRY NOT TO DO ANY DUMB THINGS LIKE I USED TO. BOY. WELL, I'M GONNA HAVE TO DIG DOWN AND GET TO THE CREEK. THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS IF YOU WANT WATER. YOU HAVE TO WORK A LITTLE HARDER FOR IT HERE. WE'LL LIVE OUT HERE AS LONG AS WE'RE PHYSICALLY ABLE, AND THEN WE'LL JUST GO CAMP ON OUR KIDS. THEY WOULD JUST AS SOON WE DIDN'T STAY OUT HERE. AHA! IT TOOK QUITE AWHILE TO GET THIS. GET GOING DOWN TO THE HOUSE. WELL, WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG? LUNCH IS READY. WE HAD A LOT OF TROUBLE. NOTHING CAN BE TAKEN FOR GRANTED IN ALASKA. THEY MAY NOW HAVE WATER, BUT THERE'S NO POWER. THE GENERATOR BROKE AND THE BATTERIES WERE DOWN BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO CHARGE THEM UP WITH. WE NEED THE BATTERIES FOR POWER AND FOR THE RADIO TELEPHONE, WHICH IS THE ONLY LINK WE HAVE WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD. THEIR SON HAS TAKEN AWAY THE GENERATOR TO BE REPAIRED IN TOWN. I'M GONNA HAVE TO CALL BUD, MY SON. Hello? HELLO, BUD. THIS IS MOM. Yeah. Hi, Mom. WE HAVE EMERGENCY HERE. IT'S BEEN SNOWING, AND WE NEED THE GENERATOR. IS IT FIXED? Yeah, it got fixed. VERY GOOD. ARE YOU GONNA BE ABLE TO COME UP YOURSELF? Well, it'll just be myself and Nathan. ALL RIGHT. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OKAY, HONEY. BYE. Okay. Bye-bye. HE GOT IT FIXED. BOY. HE'S GOING TO BRING IT UP ON THE TRAIN WITH HIS SON, OUR GRANDSON, NATHAN. MARY'S SON, BUD, LIVES 100 MILES SOUTH IN WASILLA. HE AND HIS SON, NATHAN, WILL TAKE THE PASSENGER TRAIN TO DELIVER THE GENERATOR TO HIS PARENTS. IT LEAVES IN JUST ONE HOUR. THERE'S NO WAY TO GET TO MOM RIGHT NOW EXCEPT FOR BY RAILROAD. GENERALLY, I'M THE ONE THEY CALL, JUST 'CAUSE I'M CLOSEST. THERE'S ALWAYS WORRY. YEAH, YOU WORRY SOMETIMES. BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ACCEPT AS PART OF THE LIFE THAT WE'VE CHOSEN TO LIVE UP HERE. THEY LOVE THE HOMESTEAD AND THEIR DESIRE IS TO LIVE UP THERE AS MUCH AS THEY CAN. LIVING IN ISOLATION, OFF-GRID, MEANS MARY AND CLYDE ONLY HAVE THEIR FAMILY TO DEPEND UPON FOR HELP. IF WE DON'T GET THE GENERATOR UP THERE FOR THEM, THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO STAY AT ALL. SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE GET THAT GEN UP THERE TODAY. THE HEAVIEST SNOWSTORM OF THE WINTER IS WREAKING HAVOC IN ALASKA. UP TO FIVE FEET OF SNOW CAN FALL IN A SINGLE DAY IN THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY. THAT'S ENOUGH TO BURY A FULLY GROWN MOOSE. OFF-GRIDDERS, MARY AND CLYDE LOVEL, ARE SNOWED IN TO THEIR REMOTE CABIN AND THE BATTERIES PROVIDING THEIR ONLY SOURCE OF ELECTRICITY HAVE ALMOST RUN OUT OF POWER. SOMEONE MOVED MY SCISSORS. I CAN'T FIND THEM. THEY'RE NOT OVER THERE? NO. NO STRENGTH. WE NEED THE BATTERIES FOR THE PHONE AND FOR LIGHTS. WITHOUT THE BATTERIES, WE'RE IN THE DARK. 100 MILES TO THE SOUTH IN WASILLA... ...MARY AND CLYDE'S SON, BUD, AND GRANDSON, NATHAN, ARE COMING TO THE RESCUE ON THE WEEKLY PASSENGER TRAIN WITH THE REPAIRED GENERATOR. IT REALLY LOOKS GOOD, NATE. THANKS FOR GETTING THAT WELDING AND EVERYTHING DONE ON THERE. IT'S USUALLY $70. 'CAUSE THEY HAVE TO CHARGE FOR A FULL HOUR. BUT I THINK I PAID $5 JUST FOR HIS TIME. I RAN IN TO MY BUDDY, JAMES, LAST NIGHT AND THE NEXT THING I KNOW, IT'S 2:30 IN THE MORNING. MAN. WELL... YEAH. YOU KNOW, YOU'D HAVE BEEN SKINNED IF YOU HAD SHOWED UP AND NO GENERATOR. THE GENERATOR IS IMPORTANT IF YOU WANT TO OPERATE ANY APPLIANCES, IF YOU WANT TO HAVE THE BATTERIES CHARGED. ELECTRICITY IS GOOD. IN 2013 IT KIND OF SUCKS NOT TO HAVE ELECTRICITY. AND MY GRANDPARENTS WILL BE VERY PLEASED THAT WE'RE COMING BACK WITH THE GENERATOR. MY GRANDMA WILL PROBABLY MAKE FRESH BREAD AND COOKIES. THE HEAVY SNOW IS ALSO CAUSING TROUBLE FURTHER NORTH IN CURRY. ROAD MASTER, HUGH EVANS, AND HIS CREW, STACY AND GUY, ARE WORKING AS QUICKLY AS THEY CAN TO CLEAR ICE AND SNOW AWAY FROM THE TRACKS. IS IT ICE AND...? A LOT OF ICE IN HERE. YEAH, MOTHER NATURE IS AT WAR WITH US CONTINUOUSLY OUT HERE, BUT I GUARANTEE YOU, SHE WILL NOT WIN. THE PASSENGER TRAIN NEEDS TO RUN THROUGH THIS STRETCH TO REACH OFF-GRID TERRITORY, BUT IT'S BURIED IN DEEP SNOW. OKAY, WE'VE GOT THE TRAIN COMING HERE. IT'LL BE HERE WITHIN HOURS. WE NEED TO GET THIS TRACK CLEANED OUT. I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW DEEP THE SNOW IS. IT COULD BE 18 INCHES OR SOMETHING. IT'S NOT GONNA BE EASY. ALL RIGHT. WELL, WE'LL DO IT AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN WITHOUT GETTING ANY OF US IN DANGER OUT HERE. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. GOOD. YEP. HUGH JUST HAS A SMALL PLOW AVAILABLE TO HIM. IT CAN ONLY MOVE A TENTH OF THE SNOW THAT THE BIG SNOW FLEET TRAIN BEING USED BY DANNY AND ANIMAL CAN. WE'VE GOT A PLOW ON THE FRONT TO GET IT CLEAR OF THE RAILS AND WINGS ON THE SIDE TO PUSH IT OUT A LITTLE BIT FURTHER. TRY TO GET THROUGH IT HERE. COME ON, BABY. COME ON, BABY. THAT MACHINE'S BOGGING DOWN QUITE A BIT. YEAH, YOU CAN DEFINITELY HEAR IT. She's pushing pretty hard. Hugh, I'm gonna have to stop. Over. ARE YOU **** KIDDING ME? A FEW MILES NORTH AT GOLD CREEK, 49-YEAR-OLD OFF-GRIDDER, JOHN WILSON, LIVES ALONE WITH ONLY HIS WITS TO RELY ON. YEAH, IT'S JUST ME. I'M IN THE SOLE CHARGE OF KEEPING MYSELF WARM AND MAKING SURE THERE'S WATER IN THE KETTLE AND ALL OF THAT, YOU KNOW, IT'S ALL ON ME. I'VE MISJUDGED HOW MUCH FUEL I NEEDED FOR THIS WINTER, AND I'M JUST CUTTING ENOUGH WOOD TO GET ME THROUGH THE DAY RIGHT NOW. I'M GONNA TRY TO DROP IT RIGHT ACROSS THE ROAD. I'M THINKING I SHOULD BE ABLE TO JUST PULL IT OUT. ALL RIGHT. I'M OUT HERE BY MYSELF. THERE'S NO ONE TO CALL FOR HELP, SO I HAVE TO BE EXTRA, EXTRA CAREFUL. WE'VE GOT OUR LOAD OF WOOD. WE'RE NOT GONNA FREEZE UNTIL AT LEAST TOMORROW. I CALL IT A GOOD MONTH WHEN I GET TO THE END OF THE MONTH AND HAVEN'T HAD TO BREAK OUT MY FIRST AID KIT. I NEEDED STITCHES ONE DAY. I DIDN'T LOSE A WHOLE LOT OF BLOOD. I USED DUCT TAPE AND WAITED UNTIL I GOT TO TOWN. MY MOM WORRIES ALL OF THE TIME. SHE WAS THE ONE THAT PUT THE DUCT TAPE ON ME. MY MOM AND MY DAD LIVED RIGHT HERE AT GOLD CREEK, YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS BORN. I LOVE MY MOM. SHE DOESN'T GET UP HERE VERY OFTEN. YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST NOT POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF WHAT ALL SHE HAS TO DO TO GET HERE. DOWN SOUTH IN TALKEETNA, JOHN'S 71-YEAR-OLD MOM, NANCY, HAS LEFT HER HOME AND IS WAITING TO CATCH THE PASSENGER TRAIN TO VISIT HIM. TALKEETNA MAY BE SMALL TOWN OF ONLY 900 PEOPLE, BUT EVEN THAT'S TOO CROWDED FOR OFF-GRIDDERS LIKE JOHN. I'M TAKING IN WINTER GEAR THAT I'VE WASHED UP FOR HIM. I DO IT MORE THAN I PROBABLY SHOULD. IT'S TOWARD THE END OF THE MONTH, SO I FILL IN FOR HIS SUPPLIES AND TAKE IN THE LAUNDRY. THEY NEVER GET TOO OLD TO BRING YOU THEIR LAUNDRY. YOU KNOW, THERE'S NO REASON FOR HIM EVER TO COME OUT. MOST OFF-GRIDDERS ARE OLDER AND DEPEND ON THEIR CHILDREN FOR SUPPORT, BUT JOHN IS A RARE BREED, RELYING ON HIS MOM TO SHUTTLE SUPPLIES. BEING ALONE, IT'S AN INHERENT DANGER. IT'S THE RISK YOU ACCEPT AND YOU LIVE WITH, AND AS A MOM, OF COURSE, I DON'T LIKE THAT. THE BUILDING HE'S IN NOW IS IN DISREPAIR. HE NEEDS A NEW HOUSE, A NEW CABIN. SO I GO IN TO ENCOURAGE AND, OF COURSE, DIRECT THINGS, AS MOMS DO. THE PASSENGER TRAIN IS STILL MORE THAN 30 MILES AWAY. IT WILL ARRIVE IN TALKEETNA IN ONE HOUR. THAT SHOULD GIVE NANCY ENOUGH TIME TO PREPARE HER MOUNTAIN OF SUPPLIES. IS THIS RED BOX COMING? NO. NO, I BELIEVE THAT ONE IS EMPTY. THANK HEAVEN? IT'S GONNA BE ENOUGH. AND THAT IS IT. YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL. THANK YOU. WHILE NANCY AWAITS THE TRAIN WITH CREATURE COMFORTS FOR HER SON, BUD LOVEL IS WELL ON HIS WAY TO RESCUE HIS PARENTS. RIGHT NOW, WITH MOM AND DAD, IT'S 20 BELOW OR 30 BELOW ZERO AND YOU FALL DOWN ON THE WAY OUT TO THE OUTHOUSE OR SOMETHING AND THE OTHER PERSON DOESN'T REALIZE IT, YOU KNOW, IT COULD BE A DEADLY THING. WHEN THE TRAIN IS NOT RUNNING DAILY, YOUR ACCESS TO HELP IS UP TO A WEEK AWAY. SOUTH OF ANCHORAGE, DANNY, ANIMAL, AND BRUCE ARE CLEARING HEAVY SNOW FROM THE TRACKS THAT RUN THROUGH THE KENAI MOUNTAINS. THEY ARE USING A HEAVY-DUTY SNOWPLOW THAT'S CAPABLE OF BLASTING AWAY SNOW AND ICE UP TO FIVE FEET DEEP. PLOWING SNOW. THIS IS THE FUN PART OF THE JOB. WHOO-HOO! LOOKING GOOD. SWEET DAY. GOOD DAY TO MOVE SNOW. THEY MUST KEEP UP THE PACE. NOT FAR BEHIND THEM AND CATCHING UP FAST, ENGINEER BUFFALO IS PILOTING THE FREIGHT TRAIN CARRYING VITAL DIESEL FUEL TO THE PORT OF SEWARD. THE SNOW AND THE SNOW FLEET ARE BLOCKING HIS PATH. WE'RE FOLLOWING DOWN THE SNOW FLEET. THEY WERE CALLED AHEAD OF US. THEY'RE GONNA GO DOWN THERE AND MAKE SURE THE TRACKS ARE PASSABLE. IF THEY'RE NOT OUT THERE DOING THEIR WORK, WE WON'T MAKE IT OVER THE HILL. THERE ARE 12 MILES OF TRACK FOR THE SNOW FLEET TO CLEAR BEFORE THE FREIGHT TRAIN CAN PASS SAFELY, BUT WITH A PRICE TAG OF $10,000 A DAY TO OPERATE, THIS MACHINE NEEDS CAREFUL HANDLING. **** THAT AIN'T GOOD. THE SNOWPLOW HAS LOST ELECTRICAL POWER AND COMES TO A STANDSTILL. WE HAVE PROBLEMS ON OUR SPREADER. UNSURE WHY. IT CAME IN NICE. IT WAS WORKING GOOD. WE STOPPED HERE, AND I AIN'T BEEN ABLE TO BRING IT UP. WHAT CAUSED THAT? HEY, WHATEVER YOU DID, IT COCKED IT UP, AND THEN IT WENT BACK DOWN, SO YOU DID SOMETHING. EVERYTHING'S KIND OF FALLING DOWN. 200 MILES NORTH IN SHERMAN, MARY AND CLYDE LOVEL ARE RUNNING DANGEROUSLY LOW ON POWER. MY GRANDSON AND MY SON ARE SUPPOSED TO BE BRINGING A GENERATOR UP. THEY SAID THEY HAD IT FIXED, I HOPE. WHEN THEY GET IT UP HERE, WE'LL CRANK IT IN AND CHARGE EVERYTHING UP. IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THE RAILROAD, I'M NOT SURE HOW WE'D GET THIS KIND OF STUFF TO AND FRO THE HOMESTEAD. I MEAN, WE'D NEED A HELICOPTER OR SOMETHING. THE ONLY MEANS OF COMMUNICATION UP THERE IS A RADIO PHONE. SO IF THERE'S AN EMERGENCY AND THE BATTERIES ARE DEAD, THERE'S NO WAY TO CALL FOR HELP. UP THE TRACKS IN TALKEETNA, NANCY WILSON IS HEADING OFF-GRID, TOO. HERE COMES OUR RIDE. DON'T TIP IT. MY. NANCY IS TAKING THREE MONTHS OF SUPPLIES TO HER SON, JOHN, WHO LIVES ON HIS OWN. HEY, HARRY, I'M GOING IN TO GOLD CREEK. AIRSTRIP OR...? YEAH, PLEASE. AT THE END OF THE AIRSTRIP. HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN SINCE YOU'VE STAYED IN GOLD CREEK? QUITE A WHILE. MY SON PROCLAIMS, WHEN I BOSS HIM AROUND, THAT HE ENJOYS LIVING ALONE. I THINK HE'S TRYING TO TELL ME SOMETHING. YOU THINK? YEAH. BUT THE LAST TIME I WAS UP, I NOTICED THAT WHEN YOU GOT TO THE OUTHOUSE, THERE'S NO HANDLE TO OPEN IT, WHICH WAS A LITTLE INCONVENIENT. IT WILL TAKE OVER AN HOUR FOR THE TRAIN TO REACH JOHN IN GOLD CREEK. I'M WORKING ON A LIST OF THINGS TO MAKE MY MOM AS MOST COMFORTABLE AS I CAN WHEN SHE GETS HERE. I'M GONNA TAKE THIS HORN DOWN AND USE THE FINGER OFF OF ONE OF THE PALMS HERE AND MAKE A HANDLE FOR THE OUTHOUSE FOR MY MOM. THE LAST TIME SHE WAS HERE SHE HAD DIFFICULTY WITH THE DOOR, SO I'M PUTTING A NEW HANDLE ON. TRY TO MAKE MOM HAPPY AND DO THE BEST YOU CAN, BUT YOU CAN NEVER REALLY ACHIEVE EVERYTHING MOM WOULD WANT YOU TO. SHE GOT MAROONED OUT HERE AND SHE SAYS, "I CAN'T GET THE DOOR OPEN." IT WAS ACTUALLY KIND OF BIG THING. SO THIS WILL BE A BIG THING OFF THE LIST. I MIGHT HAVE TO DO IT OVER HERE. WE'RE JUST FIGURING IT OUT AS WE GO. IT'S AN OUTHOUSE, SO I'M NOT GONNA TRY TO GET TOO FANCY WITH IT. BUT THIS WILL WORK. HER HAND WILL FIT RIGHT ON THERE, AND SHE'LL BE ABLE TO GET THE DOOR OPEN. ONE ELEGANT HOME IMPROVEMENT DOWN, THREE TO GO. AND NOW I HAVE TO FIX THE BULLET HOLES IN THE SCREEN. BACK ON THE SOUTH END OF THE ALASKAN RAILROAD, AN ELECTRICAL FAILURE HAS STRANDED THE SNOW FLEET CREW, BUT THINGS ARE LOOKING UP. WE'VE GOT VOLTAGE NOW. HEY, TRAVIS. WHATEVER HE DID, IT WORKED. LET'S GO. ALL RIGHT. WE GET TO GO PLAY. LIFE IS ALWAYS BETTER ON TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN. NOW THE POWER IS BACK. THE PLOW CAN SPREAD ITS WINGS AGAIN. GOOD JOB. YEAH, IT'S PROBABLY A FUSE. OKAY, PROBLEM SOLVED. THE SPREADER IS READY. STEER THE TRAIN SOUTHWARD WHEN READY. ROGER THAT. EVERYTHING IS GOOD. HERE WE GO. WE'VE GOT THIS SEWARD FREIGHT BEARING DOWN ON US. WE DON'T HAVE ANY TIME TO SPARE HERE, SO WE'RE TRYING TO GET THIS THING CLEANED UP BECAUSE HE'S GOT SOME HOT FUEL. 200 MILES NORTH IN SHERMAN, MARY AND CLYDE LOVEL'S HOMESTEAD IS NOW WITHOUT ELECTRICAL POWER AND ONGOING SNOWFALL HAS PUT THE ELDERLY OFF-GRIDDERS IN EVEN MORE DANGER. THE AMOUNT OF THE SNOW WE HAVE ON THERE NOW, IF IT CONTINUES TO PILE UP HIGHER ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE HOUSE, THEN IT WILL COLLAPSE IT. THAT WE DON'T NEED OUT HERE. JUST 40 MINUTES AWAY, MARY AND CLYDE'S SON, BUD, IS UNAWARE OF THE NEW THREAT TO THE FAMILY HOMESTEAD. THEY'RE GETTING UP IN YEARS, YOU KNOW, DAD'S 84, I THINK, AND MOM'S 76. IT'S PRETTY DANGEROUS WHEN THERE'S NO ONE UP THERE TO BACK YOU UP. BUT 30 MILES AHEAD, SNOW STILL COVERS THE TRACKS AND THE PASSENGER TRAIN WON'T BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH. IT'S BOGGING DOWN PRETTY GOOD, PUSHING A LOT OF SNOW HERE. OVER. IN CURRY... YEAH, HOLD ON. HOLD ON. HOLD ON. ...HUGH AND HIS CREW NEED TO CLEAR AWAY A PILE OF SNOW THAT'S BLOCKING THE TRACK TO ALLOW THE NORTHBOUND PASSENGER TRAIN THROUGH TO SHERMAN AND GOLD CREEK, BUT THEIR PLOW ISN'T POWERFUL ENOUGH TO PUSH THROUGH IT ON THE ICY RAILS. GO AHEAD AND BACK OFF OF IT EASY THERE PLEASE. OVER. UNDERSTOOD. BACKING UP SO I CAN TRY TO GET A BETTER RUN AT HER. OVER. FOR HUGH AND STACY, THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY OUT, SHIFT SOME OF THE ICE AND SNOW BY HAND TO MAKE A CLEAR RUN UP FOR THE MACHINE. YEAH, WE'VE GOT QUITE A BIT OF ICE OVER THE RAIL. YEAH, IT'S PRETTY HARD. OKAY, GUY. WE'RE READY DOWN HERE. ALL RIGHT. COMING AT YOU. HE'S GONNA HAVE TO BE CAREFUL GOING IN. WE'RE GONNA WANT TO KEEP TABS ON HIM FOR SURE. HERE HE COMES. PUT YOUR BIG BOY PANTS ON AND PUSH THROUGH THAT, GUY. That's easy for you to say, you're standing on the ground. THAT'S WHERE THE WORK'S AT. I'M READY FOR A BUMP. THERE WE GO. WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT. ALL RIGHT. THAT'S THE WAY YOU PUSH THE SNOW. THAT LOOKS GOOD. AFTER A THREE-HOUR STRUGGLE, THE TRACK IS FINALLY CLEAR. THE PASSENGER TRAIN CARRYING NANCY, BUD, AND NATHAN SPEEDS BY ON SCHEDULE. ALL RIGHT. THAT WAS A CLOSE ONE. WE GOT THAT ONE, BUD. YEAH, WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT TOO MANY MORE TIMES. ALL RIGHT. APPRECIATE THAT BROTHER. THAT WAS CLOSE, A LITTLE BIT TOO CLOSE. I TRY NOT TO DO THAT ON A REGULAR BASIS. ONE MORE DAY ON THE TOUGHEST RAILROAD IN THE COUNTRY. GOT THAT TRAIN THROUGH HERE. TIME TO GO HOME AND EAT AND WARM UP. NOW THAT THEY HAVE PASSED THE DANGER POINT, NANCY IS JUST EIGHT MILES AWAY FROM HER SON, AND BUD AND SON, NATHAN, ARE NEARLY IN EYESHOT OF HIS PARENTS' HOME. COMING UP SHORTLY, YOU'RE GONNA BE SEEING A BLUE HOUSE. THAT'S THE HOME OF MARY AND CLYDE LOVEL. YEAH, MY GRANDPARENTS WILL BE VERY PLEASED THAT WE'RE COMING BACK WITH THE GENERATOR. HI, YOU GUYS. WELCOME BACK, AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRINGING THE GENERATOR. THAT'S A LIFE SAVER. SEE YOU TOMORROW. COME AND GIVE ME A HUG. OKAY. THANK YOU. WHY DON'T YOU HEAD OUT AND WE'LL FOLLOW YOU UP. OKAY. IF THE RAILROAD WASN'T HERE, I DON'T KNOW HOW ANYBODY COULD LIVE. IT'S 32 MILES TO THE NEAREST ROAD IN ONE DIRECTION AND 28 MILES IN THE OTHER DIRECTION. THAT'S A LONG WAYS TO WALK. ALL RIGHT, NATE. THERE SHE IS. GOOD TO HAVE THE GEN BACK AGAIN. WE'VE GOT TO GET THIS THING CRANKED UP AND GET SOME THINGS CHARGED UP AGAIN SO THE RADIO WILL WORK. SO YOU GUYS READY? YEP. LET'S GET IT SET UP AND SEE IF IT ACTUALLY PUMPS OUT SOME JUICE. OKAY. SUCCESS. GOOD JOB, MAN. GOOD JOB. NEXT TASK, DEAL WITH THE AFTERMATH OF THE HEAVY SNOWSTORM. WHAT YOU GOT THERE DAD? WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GET THAT STUFF OFF OF THERE, BUD. YEP. YEAH, YOU CAN SEE IT'S STARTING TO SAG A LITTLE BIT. DO YOU WANT TO START FROM THE SOUTH SIDE? YEAH, I THINK SO. YEAH. I'LL JUST THROW A SHOVEL UP THERE AND HACK AT IT. SO I THINK WHAT I'M GONNA DO IS GRAB THE SNOW MACHINE AND RUN OVER HERE. OKAY. SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN. YEAH. ALL RIGHT. SOUNDS GOOD. THE ONLY TIME I REALLY WORRY ABOUT MY GRANDPARENTS BEING UP HERE IS IF THE CONDITIONS, LIKE THE WEATHER, GET REALLY BAD. YEAH, WATCH THAT SIDE SLOPE THERE. YEAH, I KNOW. AND JUMP BACK IF IT STARTS TO SLIDE BECAUSE THE EDGE OF THAT ROOFING IS SHARP. YEAH. FINE. HOLD ON. I'M GONNA GET CUT ON THIS WIRE. YEAH. THERE YOU GO. THAT WAS PRETTY QUICK. ALL RIGHT. SO JUST START BACK BEHIND WHERE YOU ARE NOW AND JUST CHOP. NO, FURTHER BACK, THAT WAY YOU CAN GET THE WHOLE RIDGE OFF OF THERE. YEAH, START BACK AT ABOUT A 45 DEGREE ANGLE. AT THE LOVEL FAMILY'S OFF-GRID HOMESTEAD IN SHERMAN, BUD AND SON, NATHAN, ARE TRYING TO CLEAR TWO FEET OF SNOW FROM THE ROOF BEFORE IT CAVES IN, BUT IT'S DANGEROUS WORK. THERE YOU GO. WHOA! **** HEY NATE. GO AROUND THE OTHER SIDE. TAKE THE MACHINE. ARE YOU OKAY? SEE IF HE'S OKAY OVER THERE. ALL RIGHT. HOLY **** **** HEY, NATE, I THOUGHT WE LOST YOU THERE. ALMOST DID. HEY, YOU DISAPPEARED OVER THE EDGE OF THAT SNOW. I KIND OF LEAP INTO THE BANK AS IT WAS MOVING AWAY. GOOD MOVE. YEAH. ALL RIGHT. JUST A FEW CUTS OF THE SHOVEL, AND THAT THING WENT KA-POO! AND SLID RIGHT OFF AND IT SURPRISED ME HOW FAST IT CAME OFF THERE. I'VE RIDDEN THAT SNOW A COUPLE OF TIMES MYSELF AND YOU CAN GET BALLED UP IN THAT STUFF PRETTY EASY, AND I WAS A LITTLE WORRIED ABOUT THAT. THE WHOLE HOUSE SHOOK BACK AND FORTH LIKE THAT AND MADE A LOUD RUMBLING SOUND. THE BOOKCASE OVER THERE CAME RIGHT DOWN... POW... OFF THE WALL, AND IT'S BEEN UP THERE FOR WAY MORE THAN 15 YEARS. BUT THAT'S ALL THE DAMAGE I'VE FOUND SO FAR. EIGHT MILES NORTH, FELLOW OFF-GRIDDER, JOHN WILSON STILL HAS A LIST OF CHORES TO DO BEFORE HIS MOM, NANCY, ARRIVES TO CHECK UP ON HIM. I HAVE TO FIX THE BULLET HOLES IN THE SCREEN. FROM INSIDE THE CABIN, I'VE SHOT OUT AT, YOU KNOW, AT PESTS AND BIRD PREDATORS, RIGHT THROUGH IT AND THERE'S BULLET HOLES IN THE SCREEN. IT WAS A SHOT OF OPPORTUNITY. MOST OF THESE SHOTS ARE LIKE THAT. THAT ONE IS A BB, AS YOU CAN TELL BY THE HOLE, AND IT'S AN ALUMINUM SCREEN, THEY JUST GO RIGHT THROUGH. IT DOESN'T EVEN AFFECT THE SHOT. AND SO I'M GONNA JUST REMOVE THIS SCREEN AND REPAIR IT SO WHEN MY MOM GETS HERE SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO LOOK AT BULLET HOLES. SHE'S REALLY ADAMANT THAT WE SHOOT OUTDOORS. NOW IT'S COMING OFF. I'M GONNA HAVE TO ATTACH THIS AGAIN FROM INSIDE. OKAY. SO WE JUST FIXED THE SCREEN THAT HAS THE BULLET HOLES IN IT. AND I HAVE TO FIX THE NO-SLIP TREAD SO WHEN MY MOM GETS HERE SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO SKID DOWN TO THE DOOR. YOU KNOW, MY MOM IS SPECIAL. I HAVE TO JUST BE THE BEST SON I CAN EVERY TIME I SEE HER. SHE ACTUALLY SENT UP THE LITTLE TRACTION TAPE, SO I'M GONNA PUT IT ON THE PLYWOOD RIGHT HERE. WITHOUT THE TRAIN, I WOULDN'T EVEN GET TO SEE MY MOM AS OFTEN AS I DO. I GET VISITORS EVERY TWO OR THREE MONTHS MAYBE. AND MOST OF MY FAMILY, THEY COME HERE EVERY YEAR, YOU KNOW, BUT IT'S DIFFERENT FAMILY MEMBERS. SO IT TAKES ACTUALLY SEVERAL YEARS FOR ALL OF MY FAMILY TO HAVE COME BY AND VISITED. THE LAST PIECE IS GONNA GO RIGHT HERE. NOW MOM'S GOT TRACTION TO GO SKIDDING DOWN TO THE DOOR. I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO HER VISIT. AND I MARKED ON HERE, MEET THE TRAIN. I HAVE TO BE AT THE TRACKS SO THAT MY MOM WON'T HAVE TO WALK OR WAIT. I MISSED THE LAST TIME MY MOM SAID SHE WAS GETTING OFF THE TRAIN. SHE HAD SOMEONE WITH HER THAT HAD TO SNOWSHOE ALL THE WAY BACK HERE AND LET ME KNOW THAT SHE'S WAITING BY THE TRACKS. I SENT A RADIO MESSAGE, AND I'M HOPING JOHN WILL BE OUT THERE. IF HE ISN'T WE'LL HAVE... WE WILL HAVE... JUST THROW ME OFF. SLOW DOWN TO 40 AND THROW ME OFF. 200 MILES SOUTH IN THE KENAI MOUNTAINS, THE FREIGHT TRAIN CARRYING FUEL FROM ANCHORAGE IS GAINING ON THE SNOW FLEET CLEARING THE TRACKS AHEAD. THE RAILROAD HAULS MORE THAN 12,000 TANK LOADS OF FUEL A YEAR. IT'S THE SAFEST WAY TO SUPPLY THE PORT OF SEWARD WITH FUEL FOR ITS SHIPS. THEY'RE GONNA DO THEIR BEST TO CLEAR THE MOUNTAIN AND THEN GET OUT OF OUR WAY TO AVOID ANY DELAY TO OUR TRAIN. WE'LL KEEP RUNNING OUR TRAIN LIKE THEY'RE GONNA GET OUT OF OUR WAY AND HOPE FOR THE BEST. AS OF YET THIS YEAR, I HAVEN'T BEEN UP ON THE MOUNTAIN. USUALLY SNOW IS AT LEAST CHEST DEEP UP THERE. REMOVING IT IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE SAFETY OF THESE FREIGHT TRAINS. GEORGE, CALL DISPATCH AND SEE WHERE THAT FREIGHT IS AT NOW, WILL YOU PLEASE? You've got about 30 minutes. THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND MOST DANGEROUS PART OF THIS RAILROAD. GUIDING THE 67-TON SNOWPLOW'S HYDRAULIC WINGS THROUGH THE ICY TUNNELS AND NARROW RAVINES TAKES A STEADY HAND. THIS TRACK LOOKS A MITE SCARY. OKAY, TIGHT BANK ALL THE WAY ON THE RIGHT SIDE. TIGHT BANKAGE EVERYWHERE. OKAY, PORTAL TUNNEL COMING UP. Portal tunnel coming up. WE DO HAVE ICE IN HERE, TRAVIS. AS WE ENTER THE TUNNEL, WE'LL SLOW DOWN TO REAL EASY SPEEDS GOING THROUGH. ROGER THAT. Okay, left side in and locked. YEAH. CAN YOU CHECK? ABOUT FIVE CAR LENGTHS, WE'LL BE STARTING THE WINGS OUT. Just throw it all the way out and lock it. Roger. YOU'VE GOT TO BE THINKING IN 18 DIFFERENT WAYS HERE. YOU'VE GOT A LOT GOING ON HERE. UP HERE IS WHERE GOD COMES TO SKI. THE TRAIN IS ABOUT 20 MINUTES BEHIND US NOW. STILL PLOWING. TRYING TO CLEAN THE RAIL AHEAD OF HIM. NEED TO GET A MOVE ON. NEED TO GET A MOVE ON. AT GOLD CREEK, OFF-GRIDDER JOHN WILSON IS WAITING FOR HIS MOM TO ARRIVE ON THE PASSENGER TRAIN. ANY DAY SOMEONE IS COMING, IT'S A SPECIAL DAY AND THE TRAIN'S GONNA BE HERE IN MINUTES. I WANT TO TOUCH BASE WITH HIM AND SEE HOW HE'S DOING. I'M NOT EXPECTING HIM TO DO EVERY CHORE THAT I HAVE DESIGNATED. I DO HEAR IT. THE RUMBLE, THAT'S THE TRAIN COMING. THAT'S WHY YOU CAN HEAR IT SO FAR AWAY BECAUSE THERE'S REALLY... THERE IS NO TRAFFIC GOING BY OR ANYTHING. I HAVE WORRIED ABOUT HIM SINCE BEFORE HE WAS BORN, BUT THAT'S WHAT MOTHERS DO. IT'S PART OF THE JOB DESCRIPTION. IT DOESN'T STOP AT 18. I HOPE HE'S THERE. WE'RE ON THE SIGHTING OF GOLD CREEK, COMING IN TO THE SOUTH END. HE'S THERE. HOW ARE YOU DOING, HARRY? HEY, JOHN. HEY, GORDON. HOW ARE YOU, MAN? NICE TO SEE YOU. HOW'S LIFE? PRETTY GOOD. DID MY MOM MAKE THE TRAIN IN TALKEETNA? THANK YOU VERY MUCH. - HEY. - HELLO. NICE TO SEE YOU HERE. YEAH. I'M GLAD YOU MADE THE TRAIN. BOY, I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT. I BROUGHT YOU A PRESENT. WOW. MOTHERS ALWAYS TRAVEL LIGHT. AWESOME. DOOR CLOSED. SEE YOU TOMORROW. HOW ABOUT YOU START THE GIRL MACHINE. ALL RIGHT. I LOVE MY MOM. SHE DOESN'T GET UP HERE VERY OFTEN, AND AFTER THIS TRIP, YOU KNOW, IT MIGHT BE A FEW YEARS BEFORE SHE COMES BACK. BUT EVERY TIME I GET READY TO GO TO TOWN, I THINK ABOUT, YOU KNOW, I MIGHT RUN INTO PEOPLE. JUST A DAY OR TWO AND I'M READY TO COME BACK UP HERE, YOU KNOW, AND GET OUT OF THE NOISE. WE MADE IT. WE MADE IT. OKAY. IF YOU OPEN AN END, YOU'LL FIND A GOLD PACKAGE. THAT'S THE ONE. THAT'S IT. I SEE IT. YOU WANT ME TO OPEN THIS? YEP, YOU CAN. WOW. YES. THANK YOU, MOM. YOU CAN EVEN EAT A STEAK WITH THAT. YEAH. AND A PHILLIPS SCREWDRIVER FOR TIGHTENING OUTHOUSE HANDLES. YOU PUT A HANDLE ON THE OUTHOUSE! YEP. ALL RIGHT. THAT'S PART OF A MOOSE? YEP. IT PROBABLY NEVER OCCURRED TO YOU TO MAYBE TAKE THAT OFF BEFORE IT FELL IN THE HOLE TOO? I'M GONNA JUST SPLIT IT RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE AND HAVE IT GO OFF BOTH SIDES. WHEN YOU'RE INSIDE AND IT FALLS OFF AND ROLLS IN THERE AND YOU'RE TRAPPED. SINCE YOU'RE NOT THINKING OF YOURSELF, THINK OF ME IF I COME TO VISIT. OKAY. IT'S REALLY SLICK, AND I DON'T HAVE TREAD. BE CAREFUL RIGHT HERE, IT SLOPES DOWN. YEP, SINCE YOU'VE MADE IT IN TO A SKI SLOPE HERE. YEAH. YOU PUT THE STRIPS DOWN. YES. GOOD PLANNING BECAUSE I CAN'T BRING YOU GOODIES IF I HAVE A BROKEN HIP. YEAH. EIGHT MILES DOWN THE TRACK... THERE YOU GO. PERFECT. ...UNDER THEIR FRESHLY CLEARED ROOF, THREE GENERATIONS OF LOVELS ARE ENJOYING LUNCH TOGETHER. REMEMBER THAT OLD, STINKY, KEROSENE REFRIGERATOR WE HAD TO PUT OUTSIDE AND... YEAH, I REMEMBER THAT VERY WELL. DO YOU REMEMBER THE BEAR BANGING THAT THING OPEN AND SPREADING THE CONTENTS, EGGS, EVERYTHING ALL OVER THE GROUND. YOU HAD JUST MADE A BIG STEW FOR ME AND DAD, AND HE HAD OPENED THAT UP AND GOT ALL OF THAT STEW. WOW, WHAT A MESS. I THOUGHT IT WAS ALL IN REALLY AIR TIGHT CONTAINERS. I DIDN'T THINK THE BEAR COULD SMELL THAT BUT, BOY. I HAD MY FACE UP AGAINST THAT WINDOW RIGHT THERE, AND I WAS GONNA SHOOT HIM THROUGH THE GLASS BUT THEM SOMETHING IN MY MIND SAID, "MOM WILL GET MAD AT ME IF I BREAK THE GLASS." THE BEAR WAS PUSHING ON THE GLASS AND I COULD SEE IT BENDING, SO I JUST FIGURED I WOULD UNTIL THE BEAR BROKE IT AND THEN I'D SHOOT IT. IN THE KENAI MOUNTAINS, THE FREIGHT TRAIN HAULING FUEL IS HOT ON THE HEELS OF THE SNOW FLEET. ANOTHER 25-30 CAR LENGTHS, WE'RE STOPPING. 20 feet. 20 FEET. ONBOARD, DANNY AND ANIMAL ARE GUIDING THE PLOW INTO A SIDING SO THE TRAIN CAN PASS. THAT'LL DO. BLADE RIGHT UP TO THE SWITCH. I'LL GO PULL THE WINGS IN AND I'LL GO UP THERE AND FIND THE SWITCH. WE'VE GOT TO FINISH THIS RIGHT NOW IF WE'VE GOT THAT FREIGHT TRAIN BREATHING RIGHT UP OUR REAR-END HERE. The lights are turned off. ALL DANNY, WE'RE ALL CLEAR. All yours. Okay here. WATCH THE POINT COMING BACK. OVER. GOT YOUR POINT THERE, 3010. LOOKING GOOD. Can I get a little stop? 3010 all stopped. WE'VE DONE A GOOD JOB, SO ALL IS WELL WITH THE WORLD. SHOULD BE SEEING A HEADLIGHT ANY MINUTE HERE. HERE THEY COME. HOT RAIL. HOT CARS. HOT FREIGHT. HOT EVERYTHING. I'M SWEATING. BUFFALO! WHOO! WITH THE SNOWPLOW OUT OF THE WAY, ANIMAL AND BRUCE CHECK THE FUEL CARS FOR LOW HANGING BRAKE LINES, FAULTY WHEELS, OR ANY OTHER DEFECTS THAT MIGHT ENDANGER THE TRAIN. EVERYTHING LOOKED GOOD. YOU GUYS HAVE A GOOD, SAFE REMAINDER OF YOUR JOURNEY. All right. Thanks, boys. Have a good day. FABULOUS DAY. I MEAN, WHERE ELSE DO YOU GET TO GO AND DO CHORES WHERE GOD COMES TO VACATION?
