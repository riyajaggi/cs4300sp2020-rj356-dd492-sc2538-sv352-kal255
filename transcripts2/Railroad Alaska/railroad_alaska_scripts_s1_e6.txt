 Railroad Alaska (2013–…): Season 1, Episode 6 - Spring Attacks - full transcript 
 With the spring thaw comes floodwater that threatens to wash away a section of track that Roadmaster Bruce must race to repair. The spring also means bears, which pose a danger to settlers ...

 IT COULD ACTUALLY CAUSE HAVOC. WE GOT TO STOP BEFORE IT GOES BAD. ...IN MORTAL DANGER. I THOUGHT I HEARD A DAMN GUNSHOT. MY HUSBAND DOESN'T THINK OF THE CONSEQUENCES. IF THEY WANT A CONFRONTATION AND THEY COME UP HERE, THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE A CONFRONTATION. THE PORT OF SEWARD, THE SOUTHERN TIP OF THE ALASKA RAILROAD. IT'S SPRINGTIME. OVER THE WINTER, THESE MOUNTAINS HAVE BEEN COVERED IN LAYER AFTER LAYER OF SNOW AND ICE. NOW IT'S MELTING FAST,

 TRIGGERING FLASH FLOODS THAT CAN WASH AWAY THIS VITAL RAIL LINE AND CUT OFF ALASKA FROM ITS PORTS. THIS MORNING, THIS WAS ALL FROZE SOLID. NOW IT'S A LAKE. HIGH LOAD. EXTREMELY HIGH. DANNY AND ANIMAL ARE PREPARING A FREIGHT TRAIN WITH $3 MILLION OF SUPERSIZED CARGO... BOOM TRUCKS, TRAILERS, AND FISHING BOATS ALL NEED HAULING TO ANCHORAGE. THIS IS THE NICEST LOAD I'VE SEEN YET. HIGH DOLLARS HERE. THIS TRIP FROM HERE IS GONNA BE THE EASIEST TRIP THIS BOAT WILL TAKE. SOMEBODY'S GONNA BE A HAPPY CAMPER WHEN THIS BABY GETS THERE. IT'S 1:00 P.M. DANNY AND ANIMAL HAVE A 115-MILE RACE AHEAD. THEY MUST GUIDE THE HIGH LOADS THROUGH A SERIES OF TIGHT TUNNELS IN THE KENAI MOUNTAINS AND PASS THROUGH A SECTION OF TRACK VULNERABLE TO SPRINGTIME FLOODING. THIS WILL MAKE HAULING THEIR 10,000 TONS OF CARGO A CHALLENGE. THEY'RE SCHEDULED TO BE IN ANCHORAGE BY 8:00 P.M. 4320, DEPARTED SEWARD. HAMMER DOWN, BOSS. HAMMER DOWN. AS LONG AS NOTHING DISASTROUS HAPPENS BETWEEN HERE AND THERE, WE SHOULD BE IN THERE WITH ABOUT 12 MINUTES TO SPARE. LOTS TO BE LOOKING OUT FOR. 60 MILES AHEAD OF THE FREIGHT TRAIN, ROADMASTER BRUCE GOUGH IS ON HIS DAILY LINE INSPECTION. IF HE SPOTS ANY PROBLEMS, HE'LL HAVE TO STOP THE TRAIN. A SUDDEN FLOOD CAN EASILY WASH AWAY BIG SECTIONS OF TRACK. NOW THAT SPRING'S HERE, THE SNOW TURNS INTO WATER. AND IF YOUR CULVERTS AND YOUR BRIDGES AREN'T READY TO TAKE ON THIS NEW WATER, YOU COULD HAVE BIG PROBLEMS. HO. THAT'S A BIG ONE. THE BEARS ARE OUT. THERE ARE MORE THAN 130,000 BLACK AND BROWN BEARS IN ALASKA, ONE FOR EVERY SIX PEOPLE LIVING IN THE STATE. NOW SPRING IS HERE. THEY'RE WAKING UP FROM HIBERNATION, AND THEY'RE HUNGRY. A FEW DAYS AGO, THERE WAS A GENTLEMAN THAT WAS ATTACKED BY A BEAR NOT VERY FAR FROM HERE. IF IT CAN HAPPEN THERE, IT CAN HAPPEN HERE. YEAH. THIS IS DEFINITELY BEAR CITY. BEARS ARE A CONSTANT THREAT, SO BRUCE KEEPS A WATCHFUL EYE AS HE INSPECTS THE TRACK. THIS ISN'T GOOD. I GOT TO GO LOOK AT THIS, LIKE, NOW. THIS CULVERT LOOKS LIKE IT'S WAY TOO SMALL TO CARRY THIS MUCH WATER. IT'S NOT GOOD WHEN YOU CAN PUT YOUR HAND UNDERNEATH THE TIES HERE. THIS IS ONE OF THESE DEALS WHERE YOU COULD COME HERE AND FIND YOUR TRACKS GONE. A SMALL STREAM CAUSED BY MELTING SNOW CAN RAPIDLY TURN INTO A RAGING RIVER. IN 2012, WATER WASHED AWAY THIS BANK UNDER A 500-FOOT SECTION OF TRACK, SHUTTING THE LINE DOWN FOR FIVE DAYS. BRUCE TO CHRIS, OVER. ROGER. We can't afford to have that track washed out. IF WE GET EVERYBODY TOGETHER, I THINK WE CAN GET THAT CHANGED TODAY. OVER. ROGER. WE'LL GET THIS GOING RIGHT AWAY. WORD OF CAUTION... A BLACK BEAR CAME OUT IN FRONT OF ME right at our work site. THANKS FOR THE INFO. NO FREIGHT TRAINS, NO PASSENGER TRAINS, NOTHING CAN GET ACROSS THESE TRACKS. 200 MILES NORTH NEAR TALKEETNA... OFFGRIDDERS NANCY AND JIM JAMES ARE ALSO DEALING WITH THE SPRING THAW. **** NANCY, GIVE ME A HAND HERE, WILL YA? YEAH, I'M COMING. AS THE SNOW STARTS TO MELT, IT'S MUCH MORE DIFFICULT FOR HEAVY SNOWMOBILES TO RIDE OVER IT WITHOUT SINKING. THE SNOW IS MELTING. AT NIGHT, IT FREEZES, AND THE TRAIL IS SLICKER THAN CAT SNOT. THE SNOWMACHINE CAN'T GO THROUGH IT. IT'S JUST A DISASTER. WE GOT OURSELVES IN A MESS TODAY, DIDN'T WE? **** THE LAST THING THEY WANT IS TO GET STUCK ON AN ALASKAN TRAIL IN SPRINGTIME. THE GRIZZLIES ARE OUT. AND THERE'S ONE BIG OL' GRIZZLY UP HERE. I MEAN, THAT THING IS HUGE. WE MEASURED HIS FRONT PAW TRACKS ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO, AND IT WAS 12 INCHES WIDE. AND IF YOU'RE IN THE WAY, YOU'RE LUNCH. THE HOMESTEADERS WHO BRAVE THESE WOODS RARELY SEE EACH OTHER, BUT TODAY, A NUMBER OF THEM PLAN TO MEET AT A SPRING PARTY IN TALKEETNA. I WISH YOU'D GO IN WITH ME. I WAS IN TOWN FIVE OR SIX MONTHS AGO. SO, ARE YOU AFRAID TO GO TO THE PARTY? YOU AFRAID YOU'LL GET IN TROUBLE? I MIGHT HAVE SOME CONFRONTATIONS WITH SOME OF THE LOCAL IMPORTED IDIOTS. THEY'RE ALL GONNA BE ASKING ME ABOUT YOU. WELL, LIE. DON'T TELL THEM THE TRUTH. LIE. AMANDA MIGHT BE THERE WITH HER NEW BABY. TAKE A PICTURE OF AMANDA AND THE KID. I GOT TOO MUCH STUFF TO DO, AND THE BEARS ARE OUT. SO, I DON'T NEED ANY BEARS COMING IN HERE TEARING... BUSTING THE WINDOW OUT AND TEARING THE PLACE UP. IN TALKEETNA, THE OLDEST BUILDING IN TOWN IS THE FAIRVIEW INN. BUILT IN 1923 TO SERVE RAILROAD TRAVELERS, IT'S THE PERFECT PLACE FOR A SPRING PARTY. ONE QUIRK OF THE SMALL TOWN IS ITS CHOICE OF MAYOR. FOR THE LAST 15 YEARS, IT'S BEEN MR. STUBBS, A CAT, WHO WILL BE ON HAND TO GREET THE OFFGRIDDERS. HIS POSITION IS HONORARY, AS THE TOWN IS ONLY A HISTORICAL DISTRICT. IT'S 2:00 P.M. THE WEEKLY SOUTHBOUND PASSENGER TRAIN WILL PASS HURRICANE AND START PICKING UP OFFGRIDDERS WHO FLAG IT DOWN FROM THE WOODS. THE TRAIN IS SCHEDULED TO REACH TALKEETNA BY 4:40 P.M. BOY, THESE TRAILS ARE GETTING SLICK. NANCY IS COMBINING THIS SOCIAL VISIT WITH A SUPPLY RUN. SHE'LL STOCK THESE COOLERS WITH FOOD FOR THE NEXT MONTH. HAVE YOU GOT EVERYTHING? I GOT A GUN, TICKETS, KEYS, MONEY. OKAY. THE RAPIDLY MELTING PATH TO THE RAIL TRACKS WILL BE DIFFICULT TO TRAVEL OVER, AND THEY MUST KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR BEARS. WELL, LET'S GET THE HELL GOING AND GET DOWN THERE. YOU NEED TO BE PREPARED. IT DOESN'T TAKE AN 8- OR 10-FOOT GRIZZLY TO DO YOU DAMAGE. 100-POUND BLACK BEAR CAN PUT IT ON YOU. IT'S 2:30 P.M. DANNY, ANIMAL, AND BUFFALO ARE 35 MILES INTO THEIR 115-MILE JOURNEY TO ANCHORAGE. 246 for 4320 north. Over. 4320. THEY'RE CARRYING MORE THAN $3 MILLION WORTH OF FREIGHT, INCLUDING TRUCKS, TRAILERS, AND FISHING BOATS. This is 1206. Roger. We're in the road by you. UNDERSTOOD. AND THANK YOU. IT'S ABOUT A MILE OUT. SUPPOSED TO BE HERE IN A COUPLE MINUTES. EVERY TIME A TRAIN PASSES A TRACK REPAIR CREW, THEY MAKE A VISUAL INSPECTION OF THE TRAIN AS IT ROLLS BY. THEY'RE LOOKING FOR ANY CARGO THAT MIGHT BE LOOSE OR FAULTS THAT COULD DAMAGE IT OR DERAIL THE TRAIN. THEY'RE GONNA ACTUALLY LOOK AT OUR TRAIN AND THEN MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS SECURE, LOOKS GOOD, NOTHING'S SHIFTING. HOPEFULLY EVERYTHING WILL LOOK GOOD. 4320, OVER. ABOUT HALFWAY BACK, APPEARS TO HAVE LOOSENED UP. WE GOT TO STOP BEFORE IT GOES BAD. BUFFALO STAYS IN THE LEAD LOCOMOTIVE WHILE DANNY AND ANIMAL GO TO SECURE THE UNSTABLE LOAD. 4320 IS SET AND CENTERED. WHAT DO YOU THINK? WE GOT LOOSE CHAINS UP HERE. THIS THING'S BEEN MOVING. IF THIS THING COMES APART IN THAT TUNNEL, IT'S JUST GONNA RIP THESE RIGHT OFF OF THERE. GET A LITTLE BIT TIGHTER. THAT **** AIN'T GOING ANYWHERE. YEAH, THAT'S A LOT TIGHTER. WITH THE TRUCK CHAINED DOWN, DANNY AND ANIMAL STOP A POTENTIAL DISASTER. THE RAILROAD'S REVENUE IS DOWN $12 MILLION FROM LAST YEAR. THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO ANGER ANY OF THEIR CLIENTS BY DAMAGING THEIR CARGO, AND THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO BE LATE, EITHER. BUFFALO NEEDS TO STEP UP THE PACE TO MAKE THEIR 8:00 P.M. DELIVERY DEADLINE. WE'RE TRYING TO GET THIS FREIGHT TO TOWN, AND IT'S NOT REALLY ADVANTAGEOUS FOR US TO HAVE TO STOP. WE NEED TO GET MOVING. LET'S GO! OVER 200 MILES AWAY, JUST NORTH OF TALKEETNA... ...54-YEAR-OLD TRAPPER JONATHON DURR HAS BEEN LIVING OFF-GRID FOR 44 YEARS. IT'S A BEAVER DAM. IT'S A REALLY GOOD ONE. MIGHT BE A DOZEN BEAVER IN THAT HOUSE. THE ARRIVAL OF SPRING MEANS THAT WATERWAYS ARE OPENING UP. IT'S THE PERFECT WEATHER FOR BEAVER TRAPPING. THERE'S THE TRAP, AND THERE ISN'T ANYTHING IN IT. I'M JUST GONNA LEAVE IT THERE. AS SOON AS THE WEATHER WARMS JUST A LITTLE BIT, THAT'S GONNA OPEN BACK UP 'CAUSE THE WATER'S RUNNING. MOST OF MY FURS, I MAKE GARMENTS OUT OF THEM. I SWAPPED AN OTTER HAT FOR A FENDER STRATOCASTER LAST FALL. THIS IS THE ULTIMATE FREEDOM, LIVING THE WAY I DO. IT'S VERY ZEN. JONATHON'S BROTHER, 66-YEAR-OLD STEVE DURR, LIVES OFF-GRID, TOO, IN A CABIN HALF A MILE AWAY ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF BACK LAKE. I FEEL LIKE A RICH MAN. EVEN IF I DON'T HAVE 5 BUCKS IN MY POCKET, I JUST FEEL LIKE I'M LIVING IN A WORLD OF WONDER. I'M GONNA TRY AND DROP IT RIGHT BETWEEN THOSE TREES THERE. YEAH, IT LOOKS LIKE IT'LL FALL GOOD. STEVE AND JONATHON WORK TOGETHER EVERY DAY TO DO THE TASKS NEEDED TO SURVIVE OUT IN ALASKA'S CRUEL WILDERNESS. I GOT A FEELING IT'S GONNA GO THIS WAY. IN THE BUSH, EVERYBODY DEPENDS ON EVERYBODY, AND STEVE AND I CUT WOOD TOGETHER. NOT ONLY IS IT MUCH EASIER TO DO, IT'S MUCH SAFER. HERE SHE COMES! YOU'RE GONNA GET IT HUNG UP. COMING YOUR WAY! **** THAT'S EMBARRASSING IN THIS NECK OF THE WOODS. BEING OUT IN THE BUSH COUNTRY LIKE WE ARE, YOU CAN REALLY JUST EMPTY OUT YOUR MIND WITH ALL THESE RIDICULOUS DISTRACTIONS. WE GOT OTHER WAYS TO DO IT. IF YOU'RE WATCHING TV AND ALL THE COMMERCIALS AND JUST CONSTANTLY BEING POUNDED BY OTHER PEOPLE'S BULL**** I CAN JUST TURN MY EARS SIDEWAYS TO THE WIND AND IT WILL BLOW RIGHT THROUGH AND COME OUT THE OTHER SIDE. I WORK UNBELIEVABLY HARD... OKAY, LOOK OUT. ...JUST DOING MY DAY TO DAY WHAT I NEED TO SURVIVE. AND THAT'S THE PRICE PEOPLE LIKE ME ARE WILLING TO PAY. UNLESS YOU REALLY THINK YOU HAVE IT IN YOU, DON'T TRY IT. IT REALLY IS A SPIRITUAL QUEST, I WOULD SAY. MOST PEOPLE WHO COME AND STAY, THEY'RE AFTER SOMETHING ON A DEEPER LEVEL. THE BROTHERS NEED TO CATCH THE PASSENGER TRAIN TO TALKEETNA IN AN HOUR'S TIME TO STOCK UP ON SUPPLIES. THEY ALSO PLAN TO PERFORM IN THEIR BAND AT THE FAIRVIEW INN PARTY TONIGHT. ALL RIGHT. THEY NEED TO HEAD TO THE TRACK BY SNOWMOBILE. BUT FIRST, STEVE NEEDS TO REPLACE A BROKEN DRIVE BELT. SOMETIMES THESE BELTS DON'T JUST WEAR OUT. THEY ACTUALLY KABOOM! SMART GUY ALWAYS HAS AN EXTRA BELT, MEANING THE SMART GUY SOMETIMES HAS TO GO GET AN EXTRA BELT, AND A DUMB GUY'S JUST OUT OF LUCK. DOWN SOUTH IN THE KENAI MOUNTAINS... ...DANNY AND ANIMAL ARE SPEEDING TOWARDS ANCHORAGE WITH THEIR $3 MILLION CARGO, MAKING UP FOR TIME LOST FIXING THE LOOSE TRUCK. BUT UP AHEAD, FIVE NARROW TUNNELS MEAN THEY'LL SOON NEED TO SLOW DOWN TO GET THROUGH SAFELY. WE WANT TO GET THERE WITH AS MINIMAL DELAYS AS POSSIBLY. THEY'RE UNAWARE THAT FURTHER AHEAD, BRUCE MIGHT HAVE TO STOP THEM. IF WE MAKE A CUT RIGHT HERE ACROSS FROM THIS JOINT HERE... HIS CREW MUST CUT OUT A PORTION OF TRACK AND DIG DOWN UNDERNEATH IT TO REPLACE A DRAIN PIPE TO HELP DIVERT FLOOD WATER AWAY FROM THE RAILROAD. YOU KNOW, WE GOT A FREIGHT COMING. WE'VE GOT TO GET ON THE PROGRAM HERE. THE EXCAVATOR WILL LIFT THIS UP OUT OF HERE AND SIT IT OUT OF THE WAY SO HE CAN DIG HIS HOLE, PUT THE NEW CULVERT IN. OKAY. WE'RE GOING LIVE. WE'RE FIXING TO PICK THE PANEL. WATCH OUT. JUST DIG, AND LET'S GET HER DONE. HEY, ROGER! WAS THAT ICE? ICE. YEAH, IT'S FROZEN, THAT SECTION RIGHT THERE. THIS ICE BINDS THE DIRT TOGETHER, MAKING IT EXTRA TOUGH FOR ROGER TO DIG OUT. WHOA! WHOA! WHOA! WHOA! 3:00 P.M. DANNY AND ANIMAL'S FREIGHT TRAIN IS ALMOST HALFWAY TO ANCHORAGE. THEY'VE BEEN DELAYED ONCE DUE TO AN UNSECURED CARGO. NOW THE SPRING THAW MEANS THEY MUST CUT THEIR SPEED GOING THROUGH FLOOD ZONES AND AREAS OF UNSTABLE SNOW. THE WEATHER'S BEEN WARMING UP. GOING REAL SLOW, 'CAUSE WE'RE IN AN ACTIVE AVALANCHE ZONE. THIS IS YESTERDAY'S SLOUGH THAT CAME DOWN. IT'S LIKE EVERYTHING UP HERE. IT'S ALL A CRAP SHOOT. WITHIN HOURS, IT CAN TURN 180 ON YOU AND BECOME DEVASTATING. UP AHEAD, BRUCE AND HIS CREW ARE REPLACING A DRAINAGE PIPE UNDERNEATH THE TRACK TO PREVENT MELTING SNOW AND ICE FROM WASHING AWAY THE RAILS. THEY NEED TO GET IT FIXED QUICKLY SO DANNY AND ANIMAL'S TRAIN CAN GET THROUGH TO ANCHORAGE. WHOA! WHOA! WHOA! WHOA! THAT FROZEN GROUND WAS LIFTING UP THE FIBER. THERE'S A FIBER OPTIC CABLE THAT'S BURIED NEXT TO THE TRACKS. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT WE DON'T DAMAGE IT. A CRUCIAL COMMUNICATION LINE RUNS ALONGSIDE THE TRACK. WE'LL HAVE TO SHOVEL A LITTLE BIT, SEE IF WE CAN FIND IT. YEAH. IF IT'S DAMAGED, IT WILL CUT OFF ANCHORAGE FROM THE PORT OF SEWARD. IF WE BREAK IT, THERE'S ALL CONSEQUENCES THAT GO WITH IT. I HEARD $50,000. THERE'S NO ROOM FOR ERROR, SO IF HE PULLS UP ON THAT PIPE, IT CAN AFFECT THAT FIBER. GOT TO DIG IT BY HAND, OR ELSE YOU'LL RIP IT OUT. WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME LEFT. 200 MILES NORTH... ...OFFGRIDDERS NANCY AND JIM HAVE MADE IT TO THE RAILROAD TO WAIT FOR THE PASSENGER TRAIN TO TALKEETNA. SO, WE HAVE PLENTY OF TIME. MAN. IT'S WET. NANCY'S TRAVELING ALONE TO MEET UP WITH OTHER OFFGRIDDERS AND GATHER SUPPLIES. IT'S A LITTLE SAD TO LEAVE JIM FOR A COUPLE DAYS. A LOT OF PEOPLE NEED A COUPLE-DAY BREAK FROM THEIR MATES, BUT I DON'T HAVE TO HAVE THAT. WE'VE LIVED TOGETHER 24/7 FOR YEARS NOW. WITH THE BEARS WAKING UP FROM HIBERNATION, IT'S DANGEROUS TO WAIT OUTSIDE UNPROTECTED. IF WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY BEARS, I DON'T THINK WE'D HAVE NEAR THE PROBLEMS WE GET INTO. THESE BEARS WILL DEFEND THEIR YOUNG. AND IF THAT MEANS WHIPPING MY BUTT, THEY WILL DO IT. YOU SEE SOMETHING? I THOUGHT I SAW SOMETHING MOVE OVER THERE. NAH, IT'S JUST A BIRD. 30 MILES UP THE TRACK... BASICALLY, WE GOT A PROBLEM. ...MIKE HOADLEY IS INSPECTING THE RAILS. THIS IS GONNA BE A PAIN. HE'S FOUND A FAULTY SECTION OF TRACK THAT COULD DERAIL THE PASSENGER TRAIN IF IT'S NOT REPLACED. JUST AN INTERNAL DEFECT THAT GREW TO THE POINT WHERE A BIG CHUNK OF THE RAIL ACTUALLY BROKE OFF. IT'LL EVENTUALLY JUST KEEP GETTING WORSE AND WORSE AND WORSE UNTIL THE RAIL BREAKS. MIKE IS IN CHARGE OF THE CREW. FORMER ROADMASTER HUGH EVANS AND 28 OTHER RAIL WORKERS WERE JUST LAID OFF BY THE RAILROAD IN AN EFFORT TO CUT COSTS. WE'RE IN A POSITION RIGHT NOW WHERE WE'RE LOSING REVENUE, AND IT'S RESULTED IN JOB CUTS. HUGH'S NOT A ROADMASTER ANYMORE. THEY'RE CONSOLIDATING A LOT OF OTHER JOBS. SO, THOSE CUTS WILL KEEP MAKING THEIR WAY DOWN THE LINE. IT'S DEFINITELY IN OUR BEST INTEREST TO KEEP THOSE TRAINS MOVING AS FAST AS WE CAN. THERE'S MUCH MORE SNOW UP HERE THAN IN THE SOUTH, WHICH MAKES REPAIR WORK DIFFICULT. THE PASSENGER TRAIN IS GETTING CLOSER, PICKING UP OFFGRIDDERS. IF MIKE'S CREW DOESN'T FINISH THE REPAIR QUICKLY, THE TRAIN WILL GRIND TO A HALT OUTSIDE TALKEETNA. IT'S REAL IMPORTANT WE GET THIS OUT BEFORE THIS NEXT TRAIN COMES THROUGH. MIKE MUST INSTALL A SPARE SECTION OF RAIL THAT'S NEAR THE TRACK. WE GOT KIND OF LUCKY. THIS ONE MATCHES PERFECT WITH WHAT'S IN THE TRACKS. WE CAN GET IT DRUG UP HERE WITH NO PROBLEMS. I THINK IT'S FROZE TO THE GROUND. WE NEED TO BREAK THAT LOOSE. YEAH. WE CAN WHACK IT A FEW TIMES WITH A HAMMER. IT MIGHT COME OUT. I ALWAYS PREFER TO HAVE THE EQUIPMENT DO THE WORK FOR ME. WE'RE JUST REALLY PUTTING OUR LITTLE BOOM TO THE LIMIT HERE OF WHAT IT'S CAPABLE OF. TRAIN'S ON OUR ASS. HE'S GONNA BE HERE PRETTY SOON, SO WE NEED TO PICK IT UP, DEFINITELY. THEY CAN'T GET THROUGH UNTIL WE'RE DONE WITH OUR STUFF. THE PASSENGER TRAIN IS NOW JUST 15 MILES AWAY, PICKING UP OFFGRIDDERS NATE AND BUD LOVEL. LET'S GO FASTER, NATE. COME ON. LET'S GET THAT SNOW SHOVELED. **** NATE HAS BEEN VISITING HIS GRANDPARENTS WITH HIS DAD, BUD. BYE, GRANDMA. BE SAFE. WE WILL. BYE, BUD! BYE, NATE! HAVE A GOOD TRIP! SEE YOU ON SATURDAY! WATCH OUT FOR THE BEARS! GOODBYE! WE'RE HEADING INTO TALKEETNA TO HAVE THE SPRING PARTY DOWN THERE. THE DURR BOYS PLAYING. WE'RE KIND OF JUST CELEBRATING THE FACT THAT NOW WE'LL HAVE MORE DAYLIGHT THAN NIGHTTIME UP HERE. I LOVE GOOD LIVE LOCAL MUSIC. SO, IT SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT TIME TO ME. DOWN SOUTH IN THE KENAI MOUNTAINS... ALL'S GOOD. REALLY IS LOOKING GOOD RIGHT NOW. WE'RE DOING FINE. IT'S NICE AND WARM. MY SPIDERS SENSES SENSE THAT EVERYTHING'S GONNA GO AS WE'D HAVE IT. AFTER SOME DELAY, DANNY AND ANIMAL'S FREIGHT TRAIN IS CLOSING IN ON THE NARROW TUNNELS THAT RUN THROUGH THE KENAI MOUNTAINS. GOT THOSE HIGH LOADS BACK THERE. THEY'RE JUST BARELY GONNA FIT THROUGH THESE TUNNELS. THERE'S NO GIVE THERE, WHATSOEVER. IF A TRAIN SEPARATES IN A TUNNEL, IT GETS UGLY REAL QUICK. AS DANNY AND ANIMAL'S LOCOMOTIVE PASSES THROUGH THE FIRST TUNNEL, ANOTHER TRACK CREW BEHIND THEM ARE CARRYING OUT ONE FINAL INSPECTION OF THEIR MILE-LONG FREIGHT TRAIN. THEY WILL STOP IT IF THEY SPOT ANY UNSECURED CARGO. THE TUNNELS ARE ONLY SO WIDE. CARVED OUT OF TOUGH SANDSTONE ROCK BY HAND OVER 100 YEARS AGO, THESE TUNNEL WALLS ARE ROUGH. IF A LARGE LOAD COMES LOOSE, IT COULD CATCH, RIP OFF, AND DERAIL THE $3 MILLION FREIGHT TRAIN. Northbound turnpike. 4320. Yeah, um, there's a strap that's hanging. HANGING? IS IT JUST HANGING IN THE AIR? OVER. It's dragging on the ground. IF WE STOP, COULD YOU PUT THAT UP? Yeah, Roger. Over. THE LOOSE CARGO IS AT THE BACK OF THE MILE-LONG TRAIN OUTSIDE THE FIRST TUNNEL. IT MUST NOW BE SECURED. IT COULD CATCH ON ONE OF THE TUNNEL WALLS AND BE RIPPED OFF THE TRAIN AS IT PASSES THROUGH. YOU CERTAINLY DON'T WANT A STRAP CATCHING ANYTHING AROUND US, BECAUSE IT COULD ACTUALLY CAUSE HAVOC, RIP THE LOAD RIGHT OFF THE CAR. 4320 TRAIN DISPATCHER, ANCHORAGE. ARE YOU ONLINE? HELLO? WE CAN'T HEAR THE DISPATCHER. **** THE SANDSTONE MOUNTAIN CREATES A COMMUNICATION DEAD ZONE FOR THE CREW. I CANNOT HEAR THE DISPATCHER. ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE ALASKAN RAILROAD, DANNY AND ANIMAL'S FREIGHT TRAIN HAS BEEN FORCED TO STOP IN A TUNNEL AFTER A TRACKSIDE INSPECTION CREW SPOTTED A LOOSE STRAP AT THE BACK OF THE MILE-LONG TRAIN. IT'S DRAGGING ON THE GROUND, AND WE DO NOT WANT TO TAKE IT THROUGH THE TUNNELS HERE. THEY RADIO THE TRACKSIDE CREW JUST OUTSIDE THE TUNNEL ENTRANCE. What was that all about? SEE THAT CABLE THERE? WITH THE MOVING OF THE TRAIN, IT WAS ABLE TO CUT THE STRAP. CUT IT RIGHT OFF? YEAH. CUT THROUGH CLEAN. IT WAS DRAGGING. DON'T WANT IT TO GET CAUGHT ON ANYTHING. WE HAD THAT PROBLEM LAST NIGHT. I'LL TIE IT OFF SO IT DOESN'T DRAG OR CATCH ON ANYTHING. NOW I'M CLEAR. YOU WANT TO MAKE THAT MOVE, PLEASE? No problem. ROGER THAT. LET THE BIG DOG WALK. WE'RE STILL ON TIME TO GET THESE TRUCKS TO ANCHORAGE. IT SHOULD BE FINE. Thank you! APPRECIATE ALL YOUR HELP. WE ARE SQUEEZING IN HERE BY THE SKIN OF OUR BEHINDS. HOW LONG WE GET HELD UP THERE, DANNY? 30 MINUTES. 30 MINUTES. NOW LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. ON THE LINE AHEAD, BRUCE'S CREW IS STILL INSTALLING A NEW DRAINAGE PIPE AND REPLACING THE RAIL THAT WAS IN DANGER OF BEING WASHED AWAY WITHOUT IT. PICK IT UP AND SPIN IT THIS WAY. WE GOT A TRAIN COMING THAT'S NOT TOO FAR DOWN THE TRACKS. WE'VE ALREADY BEEN GETTING CALLS FROM THE DISPATCHER. HOW ABOUT WE DO A RAIL CHECK HERE? YEAH, LET'S DO THAT. SUN'S OUT. IT'S GETTING PRETTY WARM. YEAH. I NOTICED THAT. NOW IT'S REALLY CREEPING UP. YEAH. THE TRACK'S TEMPERATURE IS RISING. WHEN STEEL WARMS UP, IT EXPANDS. IF IT STARTS GROWING ON US, THIS SECTION OF TRACK, WE'RE NOT GONNA GET IT BACK TOGETHER. BRUCE WORRIES THE TRACK THEY'VE REMOVED WON'T FIT BACK INTO POSITION. WE GOT TO GET THAT IN THERE WHILE IT STILL FITS. THIS IS REALLY THE CRUCIAL PART. THESE TRACKS HAVE TO LINE UP PERFECTLY. IF IT GETS HOT, THE RAILS CAN GROW AND IT WON'T FIT BACK IN THERE. WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS COME UP JUST A TAD AND SWING THAT WAY A LITTLE BIT. KEEP GOING DOWN. OKAY. I DON'T THINK IT'S GONNA FIT. PRETTY **** UP. OVER 200 MILES NORTH... THIS IS OUR HORSE AND BUGGY HERE. ...OFFGRIDDER BROTHERS STEVE AND JONATHON DURR ARE FIXING THEIR SNOWMACHINE. IT'S A LITTLE WORN. THIS ONE LOOKS NICE AND NEW. IF THEY MISS THE TRAIN, THEY WON'T MAKE IT TO TALKEETNA TO GET SUPPLIES OR MEET UP WITH THE OTHER OFFGRIDDERS FOR THE SPRING PARTY. THERE WE GO! MISSION ACCOMPLISHED. A FEW MILES NORTH, NANCY AND JIM JAMES ARE ALSO WAITING. SON OF A GUN! THAT'S A 50-MILE-AN-HOUR GUST. IT'S A LITTLE PAST DUE, AND I START GETTING MORE ANXIOUS BECAUSE I'M AFRAID WE'VE MISSED IT. THE TRAIN IS 8 MILES NORTH OF THEM, PACKED WITH OFFGRIDDERS, INCLUDING BUD AND NATE LOVEL. GONNA GO TOWN AND PARTY. SPRING PARTY TIME. PARTY HARDY! ROCK 'N' ROLL! AND JOHN SHOULD BE GETTING ON, I THINK. WITH SO MANY PICKUPS, IT'S A SLOW JOURNEY. JOHN, HOW'S IT GOING? PRETTY GOOD. HOW YOU DOING? JOHN'S OUR NEAREST NEIGHBOR WHEN I WAS GROWING UP. FROM WHERE HIS HOMESTEAD IS TO OUR HOUSE IS ABOUT 7 MILES. TODAY'S THE BIG "GOING TO TOWN" DAY. I GET TO SEE REAL PEOPLE AND MAYBE EVEN A FEMALE. THERE'S NO WOMEN OUT WHERE I'M AT. UP AHEAD, MIKE AND HIS TRACK CREW ARE BATTLING THE SNOW AND ICE TO REPLACE A CRACKED RAIL. WE PUT RAIL TONGS ON IT AND WALK IT OVER. YEAH. OKAY, LET ME GET ONE MORE PULL ON IT. WE'RE UP. BEAUTIFUL. THEY NEED TO CUT THE RAIL TO SIZE AND INSTALL IT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. ONCE WE GET THE RAIL CUT, IT SHOULDN'T TAKE LONG. THERE'S DEFINITELY A LOT OF PRESSURE TO GET THIS THING OFF BEFORE THE NEXT TRAIN. SO, HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET THAT DONE. WE HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO DO OUR JOB, BUT THERE'S NOT GONNA BE A WHOLE LOT OF TIME FOR MESSING AROUND OR STUFF TO NOT GO AS PLANNED. **** IT'S BINDING UP! YOU'RE **** ME. NO! **** THAT'S WHAT IT FEELS LIKE. EVERY SO OFTEN, I'LL JUST GRAB. **** THAT'S A PROBLEM. GOT TO GET THAT **** OUT OF THERE. THEIR SAW IS STUCK IN THE CUT. THEY MUST WAIT FOR IT TO COOL DOWN. WE GOT TRAINS COMING. WE DON'T WANT TO HOLD THEM UP. CAN YOU PULL IT OUT? MAYBE, YEAH. ALL RIGHT, WE'RE GOOD. ONE MORE HURDLE THAT WE'RE NOW OVER, I GUESS. HAD ME WORRIED FOR A SECOND. NOW THEY CAN BOLT THE NEW RAIL INTO PLACE. WE'LL GET EVERYBODY PACKED UP HERE AND GET OUT OF HERE. WE CAN GO HOME AFTER THIS TRAIN GOES BY. IT'S A PRETTY GOOD FEELING THAT THEY GOT OVER THE TRACKS SAFELY AND IT MADE THEIR TRIP SMOOTH. FURTHER DOWN THE TRACK... WHERE THE HELL IS HE AT? SHOULD BE HERE ANY TIME. FINALLY. IT'S ABOUT DAMN TIME. YOU GOING TO A PARTY? GOING TO A PARTY. OKAY, SWEETIE. MWAH! I LOVE YOU. NOW THE WIFE'S GONE, IT'S TIME TO PARTY? HEY, NOW. DON'T GIVE HIM ANY IDEAS! BYE, HONEY. BYE, HONEY. NANCY VERY RARELY LEAVES HER HUSBAND ALONE AT THE CABIN. THE REASON HE DOESN'T COME WITH ME IS HE'S THERE PROTECTING THE CABIN. BUT HE REALLY DOESN'T LIKE TO COME TO TOWN ANYWAY. IT'S A LITTLE STRESSFUL. I ALWAYS WORRY ABOUT HIM. ALONE IN THE WOODS, JIM'S READY TO DEFEND HIS DOMAIN FROM DEADLY BEARS. WHEN NANCY IS NOT AROUND, I TEND TO WORRY PROBABLY A HELL OF A LOT MORE THAN I SHOULD. BUT THAT'S JUST ME. I WORRY. I PERSONALLY BELIEVE IT'S TOTAL IDIOCY TO EVEN CONTEMPLATE COMING INTO THE WOODS WITHOUT A FIREARM, MAYBE EVEN MULTIPLE FIREARMS, PREFERABLY A 12-GAUGE PUMP SHOTGUN, TO PROTECT YOU AGAINST ATTACKS. WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT? I THOUGHT I HEARD A DAMN GUNSHOT. IN ALASKA... I THOUGHT I HEARD A DAMN GUNSHOT. ...JIM IS HOME ALONE AND THINKS HE'S HEARD HUNTERS TRESPASSING ON HIS LAND. I DON'T SEE ANYTHING. DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS. COULD HAVE BEEN A TREE CRACKING. THAT HAPPENS OUT HERE WITH THE SNOW LOAD. SOMETIMES WHEN YOU HEAR WEIRD NOISES OR GUNSHOTS, YEAH, YOU GET A LITTLE NERVOUS. IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO BE ON TOP OF THINGS BEFORE THINGS ARE ON TOP OF YOU. DON'T NEED TO HAVE ANY SURPRISES. IT WILL BE A BIG RELIEF WHEN NANCY'S BACK. SHE'S GOT HELL OF A LOT BETTER EARS AND EYES THAN I DO. AND IT'D JUST BE NICE TO HAVE HER AROUND AS AN EARLY WARNING SYSTEM, IF NOTHING ELSE. A FEW MILES DOWN THE TRACK, BROTHERS STEVE AND JONATHON DURR HAVE MADE IT TO THE RAIL LINE IN TIME TO FLAG DOWN THE TRAIN TO TALKEETNA. AND ONE MORE, 4322. One more. AND 4322. THAT WILL DO. WELL, HELLO THERE. WHERE YOU HEADED TODAY, SIR? WE'RE GOING TO THE BEAUTIFUL TOWN OF TALKEETNA, ALASKA. THE BEAUTIFUL TOWN OF TALKEETNA. OKAY. ALL ABOARD. HOW YOU DOING, BUD? I'M DOING REAL GOOD. DOING GOOD. SO, ARE YOU GONNA BE PLAYING AT THE FAIRVIEW? YEAH. WE'LL HAVE A BIG "PAH-TY." ON THE SOUTH END OF THE ALASKAN RAILROAD... EYES ON 53 IN EFFECT. 53 IN EFFECT. ...DANNY AND ANIMAL ARE GUIDING THEIR $3 MILLION, HIGHLY STACKED FREIGHT TRAIN THROUGH THE KENAI MOUNTAINS. LOTS OF ENGINES AND LOTS OF TONNAGE BEHIND US. A LITTLE SHY OF 10,000 TONS. ABOUT 4,400 FEET. MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN OUR HANDS. BUT JUST AHEAD, BRUCE'S CREW ARE STRUGGLING TO GET THE TRACK BACK IN PLACE. WE GOT TO GET HIM TO SWING IT. THE STEEL RAIL HAS EXPANDED IN THE SUN, AND NOW IT WON'T FIT. ALMOST THERE. SEE IF YOU CAN GET HIM TO GO DOWN A LITTLE BIT MORE. BRUCE HAS TO RESORT TO BRUTE FORCE TO SQUEEZE THE SECTION INTO PLACE. LET'S USE THIS BUCKET TO PUT SOME PRESSURE ON IT. ONE MORE. COME ON. WE NEED TO GET A MOVE ON. WE'RE NOT OUT OF THE WOODS TILL THE FIRST TRAIN GETS OVER IT. YEAH, IT'S 100% BETTER. ALL RIGHT. THE TRAIN'S OUT. HE'S COMING. YEP. WE GOT TO GET GOING. OKAY, LET'S DO IT. ALL RIGHT. DANNY AND ANIMAL'S FREIGHT TRAIN IS GETTING CLOSE, SO BRUCE MUST GET HIS VEHICLE OFF THE TRACK FAST. WE ONLY DID IT IF WE CAN GET OUT OF THE WAY IN TIME. I'VE GOT A CROSSING HERE I CAN SET OFF ON. THIS SHOULD WORK OUT JUST GREAT. APPROACHING YOUR VECTOR. OVER. Roger that. WE'RE BY MAINTENANCE WAY. IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'VE BEEN OUT WORKING HERE TODAY ALL CLEAR. LOOKED GOOD, BRUCE. YEAH, IT LOOKED GOOD ON OUR SIDE, MAN. JOB COMPLETE. IT IS SWEET. IT'S A-OKAY. 200 MILES AWAY, THE PASSENGER TRAIN HAS ALMOST REACHED TALKEETNA. DAD, DO YOU KNOW WHAT TIME THEY START PLAYING MUSIC? RIGHT AFTER THIS. THE SPRING PARTY HAS THE TRAIN FILLED WITH OFFGRIDDERS LOOKING FORWARD TO THE RARE CHANCE TO SEE ONE ANOTHER. BEAUTIFUL DOWNTOWN TALKEETNA. ALL RIGHT. OKAY. THANK YOU FOR THE RIDE. AS MUCH AS I LOVE LIVING IN THE WOODS, I DO ENJOY COMING TO TOWN. THERE'S A CERTAIN ENERGY WITH MY FRIENDS THAT I GET. THANK YOU SO MUCH. MY ONLY WORRY IS IF JIM'S OKAY. MY HUSBAND SEEMS TO BE SORT OF ACCIDENT PRONE. HE'S GUNG HO AND GOES ABOUT THINGS LIKE A BULL AND SOMETIMES DOESN'T THINK OF THE CONSEQUENCES. IN A REMOTE WILDERNESS FILLED WITH WILD ANIMALS AND HARSH WEATHER, UNUSUAL SOUNDS CAN OFTEN MEAN TROUBLE. WHENEVER NANCY GOES TO TOWN, THINGS GET A LITTLE BIT MORE TENSE OUT HERE. I HAVE TO RELY TOTALLY ON MYSELF. I HEARD A GUNSHOT. **** AND I DON'T LIKE THIS. I DON'T LIKE SURPRISES. LET ME TAKE A LITTLE BREAK. I GOT TO GO OUT HERE. OFF GRID NEAR TALKEETNA... SOMEBODY THAT'S NOT INVITED, I WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE HELL THEY'RE DOING UP HERE. JIM HAS HEARD GUNFIRE AND IS TRYING TO TRACK DOWN TRESPASSERS ON HIS LAND. IF THEY WANT A CONFRONTATION AND THEY COME UP HERE, THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE A CONFRONTATION. THEY JUST BETTER BE A BETTER PISTOL SHOT THAN I AM. JIM HAS SURVIVED OFF GRID IN AMERICA'S LAST FRONTIER FOR 20 YEARS. NOTHING IS GOING TO GET IN HIS WAY, NEITHER BEARS NOR TRESPASSERS WILL STOP HIM FROM LIVING THE WAY HE WANTS TO LIVE. I'M NOT AFRAID OF ANYBODY. I DON'T LIKE IDIOTS COMING INTO MY YARD, COMING UP TO MY PROPERTIES. I HAVE HAD A FEW INDIVIDUALS TRESPASSING ON ME. I'M STILL HERE, AND THEY'RE NOT. SO, THE RESULTS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES. I REALLY DON'T GIVE A DAMN WHAT ANYBODY THINKS ABOUT THE WAY I LIVE. KEEP YOUR OPINIONS TO YOURSELF. I HAVE LEARNED OVER THE YEARS OPINIONS ARE LIKE **** EVERYBODY'S GOT ONE, AND EVERYBODY'S STINKS EXCEPT MINE. IT'S 8:00 P.M. LET'S RAP. RAP? DANNY AND ANIMAL ARE RUNNING 30 MINUTES BEHIND SCHEDULE AND ARE ON THE LAST LEG OF THEIR FREIGHT MISSION TO ANCHORAGE. THE FREIGHT WILL BE DELIVERED. I'M SO EXCITED ABOUT GOING HOME TONIGHT. DANNY, ARE YOU A HAPPY CUSTOMER? I'M HAPPY WHEN I'M EATING CUSTARD. FEELS GOOD TO BE HOME. WHAT A HELL OF A JOURNEY. HAD A LOT OF THINGS HAPPEN TODAY. IT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE DEALS. IT'S ALL LOOKING GOOD. YEAH. THIS LOAD MADE IT. THIS GUY'S GONNA BE HAPPY WHEN HE GETS HIS $100,000 BOAT. LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. IN TALKEETNA, ALL OF THE OFFGRIDDERS HAVE MADE IT TO THE FAIRVIEW INN EXCEPT STEVE DURR, WHO'S BUYING A SPARE DRIVE BELT FOR HIS SNOWMACHINE. I HOPE THIS IS THE RIGHT SIZE. THAT'S A MIRACLE. IT'S THE RIGHT SIZE AND THE VERY LAST ONE. OKAY. HE SHOULD BE PERFORMING, BUT AS THE LOCAL SAYING GOES, TALKEETNA TIME IS NEVER ON TIME, SO NO ONE'S EVER REALLY LATE. I JUST WANT TO SAY IT'S GREAT TO SEE EVERYBODY HERE TODAY AT THE FAIRVIEW INN IN BEAUTIFUL DOWNTOWN TALKEETNA, ALASKA, THE SOUL OF THE ALASKA RAILROAD LINE. WE'VE GOT A TUNE WE'RE GONNA DO FOR YOU HERE. IT'S CALLED "FLAG STOP TRAIN." IT WAS NICE TO SEE SOME OF THE PEOPLE FROM UP THE TRACKS, WHICH IS THE COMMUNITY ACROSS THE RIVER, ACROSS THE RAILROAD BRIDGE. * AAHHHH * AND IT WAS NICE TO SEE THAT COMMUNITY COME IN FOR TONIGHT'S CELEBRATION. * WHEN THE STEAM... * LIVING UP THE TRACKS, WE DON'T HAVE VERY MANY CHANCES TO CATCH UP ON THE NEWS WITH EACH OTHER. IT'S FUN. IT'S FUN SEEING ALL THE LOCALS. OFFGRIDDERS AMANDA AND KENNY HAD A BABY BOY TWO MONTHS AGO. AND THIS IS THE FIRST CHANCE NANCY HAS HAD TO SEE HIM. HI, KENNY. HOW'S IT GOING? JIM WANTS ME TO TAKE A PICTURE OF YOU GUYS. OKAY. CAN I DO THAT? AWW. TELL JIM WE SAY HI. I WILL. THE ALASKA RAILROAD DOESN'T JUST TRANSPORT PEOPLE AND THEIR SUPPLIES. IT'S AT THE VERY HEART OF THIS UNIQUE OFF-GRID COMMUNITY'S IDENTITY. THIS IS MY BIGGEST TRIP OF THE YEAR. AND EVERYBODY ON THE TRAIN, THEY'RE ALL MY FRIENDS. EVERYBODY. AND IT'S JUST A WONDERFUL TRIP FOR ME, 'CAUSE I'VE BEEN STUCK IN A CABIN. THE TRAIN TAKES YOUR COMMUNITY TO THE NEXT LEVEL. SO PEOPLE STICK TOGETHER. THEY TAKE CARE OF EACH OTHER. AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. IT'S GREAT. I CAN'T IMAGINE THIS TOWN WITHOUT THE RAILROAD. HALF MY FRIENDS WORKED ON THE RAILROAD. SO, I GUESS THAT MAKES IT ALL IMPORTANT. IMPORTANT! * A FLAG STOP TRAIN * * YEAH, YEAH, YEAH *
