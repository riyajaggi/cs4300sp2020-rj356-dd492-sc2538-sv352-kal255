 IT'S THE LIFELINE WE HAVE. THAT'S IT. ...WITH NO CHANCE OF RESCUE. CLYDE, WHERE ARE YOU? THE PORT OF SEWARD... ALASKA'S VITAL TRADING LINK WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD. NEARLY A MILLION TONS OF FREIGHT PASSES THROUGH THIS PORT EACH YEAR, FROM BUILDING SUPPLIES AND HEAVY EQUIPMENT, TO PETROLEUM AND COAL. READY DOWN THERE, DAN? OVER. YEAH, I WOULD ESTIMATE 25... 2-5... CAR-LENGTHS TO THE HOOK. RAIL CREW DANNY AND ANIMAL ARE HOOKING TOGETHER A MILE-LONG TRAIN LOADED WITH A CRITICAL DELIVERY...

 $10 MILLION OF DRILLING PIPE THAT WILL BE USED IN THE OIL FIELDS OF NORTH ALASKA. THE OIL INDUSTRY IN ALASKA IS THE NUMBER-ONE BUSINESS HERE. IT'S PRETTY MUCH THE LIFEBLOOD OF THE STATE. THE OIL INDUSTRY IS WORTH AROUND $9 BILLION A YEAR TO ALASKA. WE PUT A POPPER IN BETWEEN THE ENGINES AND THIS PIPE LOAD. THE REASON WE DO THAT IS BECAUSE THE PIPE LOADS COULD SHIFT. IF THEY SHIFT, THEY COULD DAMAGE THE LOCOMOTIVES. THOSE ARE $2-MILLION LOCOMOTIVES APIECE. WE HAVE SIX OF THEM UP HERE TODAY. SO WE DO NOT WANT TO DAMAGE THOSE ENGINES. WE ONLY HAVE SO MANY ON THIS PROPERTY, SO THEY'RE VERY IMPORTANT TO PROTECT THEM. EVERYTHING LOOKS REAL GOOD. BEFORE DANNY AND ANIMAL BEGIN THEIR FREIGHT MISSION, TRANSPORT SUPERVISOR PAT VOLMER GIVES THEM THE LOWDOWN ON JUST HOW CRUCIAL TODAY'S JOURNEY IS. MORNING, BOSS. HOW'S IT GOING, PAT? HEY, WHAT'S UP, GUYS? I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU, MAN. GOOD TO SEE YOU, MAN. IT'S AN IMPORTANT TRAIN TODAY. YEAH, WE HEARD. HOT, HOT LOADS. YEAH, YOU KNOW THE DEAL. EVERYTHING'S HOT, BUT THIS ONE IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT. I KNOW YOU'VE MOVED LOTS OF PIPE, BUT THIS PIPE IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S A NEW CUSTOMER. LOT OF POTENTIAL BUSINESS COMING UP IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS HERE, AND THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF IT. THIS IS THE TIP OF THE SPEAR. SO, A HUGE SHOT IN THE ARM FOR THE RAILROAD. EVERYONE FROM THE C.E.O. ON DOWN WILL BE WATCHING. SO THE SOONER WE CAN GET THOSE CARS IN ANCHORAGE... YOU GOT IT. YOU KNOW THE DEAL. WE'RE GOING THROUGH SOME BUDGET CONSTRAINTS, SO WE'RE TAKING ON A NEW CUSTOMER WITH THE HOPES THAT HIS PRODUCT WILL LEAD TO FUTURE WORK. MORE BUSINESS WILL CREATE MORE JOBS. THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT. THE ALASKA RAILROAD'S REVENUE IS DOWN $12 MILLION FROM LAST YEAR. THE RECESSION IS HITTING THEM HARD, AND IT'S NO SECRET THAT LAYOFFS ARE LOOMING. THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE WALKING AROUND HERE VERY SCARED. NOBODY WANTS TO SEE ANYBODY GET HANDED A PINK SLIP AND WALK HOME AND HAVE TO TELL THEIR FAMILY THAT THEY CAN'T FEED THEM THAT DAY BECAUSE THEY NO LONGER HAVE A JOB. A LOT OF UNCERTAINTIES THERE. ALL RIGHT, ANIMAL, I BELIEVE THAT ALL THESE LOADS ARE SECURE. LET'S GET THIS OUT OF TOWN. LOOKS GOOD. LET'S GET BUSY. RAILROAD HAULS MORE PIPE FOR THE NORTH SLOPE OIL INDUSTRY THAN ANY OTHER MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION. WE HELP EACH OTHER EXIST. SO, HOPEFULLY, THAT TREND WILL CONTINUE. IT'S NOW 8:00 A.M. THEY HAVE A SEVEN-HOUR JOURNEY AHEAD THAT WILL TAKE THEM THROUGH WOODLANDS NOTORIOUS FOR DEADLY COLLISIONS WITH WILDLIFE AND ICE-PACKED TUNNELS RUNNING THROUGH THE KENAI MOUNTAINS. THEY WANT TO ARRIVE AT ANCHORAGE BY 4:00 P.M. CONSTANTLY ON THE LOOKOUT FOR ANYTHING THAT WOULD AFFECT THE MOVEMENT AND SAFETY OF THIS TRAIN. GOT MIRRORS PLACED ON THE SIDES OF THE LOCOMOTIVE SO YOU CAN LOOK BACK AND SEE BEHIND YOU. YOU LOOK OUT IN FRONT... CRITTERS COME OUT, HUMANOIDS. YOU JUST GOT TO STAY ALERT AND AWARE. IF A CRITTER DID COME OUT OF THE WOODS, WE TRY TO MAKE NOISE AND GET IT TO MOVE OUT OF THE WAY, TRY TO SLOW DOWN. I MEAN, WE HIT MOOSE, WE'VE HIT CARIBOU. WE'VE HIT BLACK BEARS, GRIZZLY BEARS. IT'S KIND OF GORY SOMETIMES. TRAINS ON THIS LINE HIT MORE MOOSE THAN ANY OTHER ANIMAL. THEY FIND IT DIFFICULT TO WALK THROUGH DEEP SNOW, PREFERRING, INSTEAD, TO USE THE SNOW-CLEARED TRACKS. UNUSUALLY HEAVY SNOWFALL LAST YEAR LURED MANY MOOSE ONTO THE RAIL LINE, AND NEARLY 300 WERE KILLED IN COLLISIONS. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE NO INCIDENTS. WE'LL SEE SOME CRITTERS, AND THEY'LL BE A WAYS AWAY, AND THEY'LL LOOK GOOD, AND THEY WON'T GET HURT AT ALL. WATCH OUT! **** ME. JUST HIT A DOG. DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE. HE'S DONE. WELL, WE HIT A DOG, AND... **** DAMN IT. OBVIOUSLY NOTHING WE COULD DO THERE. THAT'S A SHAME, BUT IT HAPPENS. YEAH, IT DOES. DON'T LIKE DOING IT, THOUGH. KIND OF SUCKS. 200 MILES NORTH, IN SHERMAN... ...THIS ISOLATED WILDERNESS IS HOME TO 76-YEAR-OLD MARY LOVEL AND HER 84-YEAR-OLD HUSBAND, CLYDE. THEY'VE BEEN LIVING OFFGRID FOR 49 YEARS. YOU WANT A CUP OF HOT TEA? YEAH. THIS IS A WONDERFUL PLACE TO LIVE. ALTHOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES LIKE THE FIRST WINTER THAT WE SPENT HERE IN THIS CABIN. THERE WAS NO INSULATION. IT GOT DOWN TO 67 DEGREES BELOW ZERO. YOU COULDN'T BREATHE OUTSIDE, IT WAS SO COLD. BUT THAT ONLY LASTED FOR TWO DAYS. AND THEN IT WARMED UP TO, I THINK, 47 BELOW, WHICH ACTUALLY FELT ALMOST SPRINGLIKE BY COMPARISON. GOT TO QUIT THOSE THINGS. I'LL BE EATING THE WHOLE BAG OF THEM. GOT PRETTY CHILLY LAST NIGHT. YOU NOTICED ABOUT 4:30 IN THE MORNING? IT WAS 16 THIS MORNING. 16... OOH. YEAH. WEATHER HERE CAN BE REALLY, REALLY BAD. IF YOU DON'T USE COMMON SENSE, YOU COULD DIE IN A HURRY. WE ARE REAL PROUD OF OUR INDEPENDENCE BECAUSE WE CAN DO WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE CAN'T, A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO DO, WHICH I'M GRATEFUL FOR, TOO, BECAUSE OTHERWISE, IT'D BE AS CROWDED HERE AS IT IS ELSEWHERE. I LIKE MY INDEPENDENCE OUT HERE. IT'S GREAT. I CAN DO WHAT I WANT, WHEN I WANT. BUT IT'S HARDER NOW THAN IT USED TO BE BECAUSE WE'RE OLDER. RECENTLY, BOTH MARY AND CLYDE HAVE HAD MEDICAL PROBLEMS. BUT THE COUPLE, WHO RAISED THEIR FOUR CHILDREN HERE, DON'T WANT TO LEAVE THE FAMILY HOMESTEAD. A YEAR AGO, I HAD A STROKE. MY HANDS STOPPED WORKING. I COULDN'T MAKE THEM DO ANYTHING. I WAS TRYING TO LIGHT A MATCH, AND THEY WOULDN'T WORK. CLYDE CAME OVER TO ME AND SAID, "WHAT'S WRONG HONEY?" AND I COULDN'T TALK. AND OUR SON CALLED THE TROOPERS, AND THEY CALLED A HELICOPTER, AND THEY COULDN'T GET IT OFF THE GROUND BECAUSE THE WIND WAS BLOWING AT 70 MILES AN HOUR. SO THEY CALLED THE RAILROAD. GOOD OLD RAILROAD TO THE RESCUE. THEY SENT A MEDIC UP. TOOK ME TO TALKEETNA, AND THEY SAID I WAS OKAY, EXCEPT THAT IF IT HAD HAVE BEEN A MAJOR STROKE, I WOULD NEVER HAVE MADE IT BECAUSE IT TOOK TOO LONG. IT WAS TWO HOURS. THAT'S THE ONLY BAD THING ABOUT LIVING OUT HERE, IS WE'RE TOO FAR FROM THE HOSPITAL. OOH! HONEY, I FORGOT TO GET MY BLOOD PRESSURE PILLS. BETTER CALL BUD AND GET SOMETHING UP HERE. I WAS TOLD THAT I NEED TO TAKE THEM TO PREVENT HAVING ANOTHER STROKE. MARY HAS A SUPPLY OF HER MEDICINE AT HER SON BUD'S HOME 100 MILES AWAY IN WASILLA. THEY NEED TO RADIO HIM TO CATCH THE WEEKLY PASSENGER TRAIN. IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO BRING THE EXTRA MEDICATION TO THE HOMESTEAD. CAN'T GET THE DIAL TONE. THE TRAIN LEAVES IN LESS THAN AN HOUR. I CAN'T DO IT. IF MARY CAN'T GET THROUGH TO BUD SOON, HE WILL MISS THE TRAIN, LEAVING HER WITHOUT MEDICINE FOR SEVEN DAYS. I HAVE NO IDEA. STUPID PHONE. 9:30 A.M.... SHERMAN. OFFGRIDDERS CLYDE AND MARY LOVEL ARE STILL TRYING TO CONTACT THEIR SON BUD IN WASILLA TO BRING THEM VITAL MEDICATION. THIS IS THE ONLY COMMUNICATION WE HAVE WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD, AND IT'S NOT VERY RELIABLE AT ALL. SOMETIMES WE CAN'T EVER GET A NUMBER ON IT. THERE IT IS. MAYBE. HELLO? Mom? Hello, mom, is that you? YEAH, IT'S ME. How you doing? WE HAVE AN EMERGENCY HERE. I KIND OF RAN OUT OF MY BLOOD PRESSURE MEDICINE. Could you repeat that, please? I NEED MY MEDICINE, BUD. I FORGOT IT. I'M SORRY. IF IT'S TOO MUCH TROUBLE, YOU COULD JUST MAYBE STOP THE TRAIN AND GIVE IT TO THEM TO THROW OFF AS THEY GO BY. I'd better get going. IT'S 9:40 A.M. THE PASSENGER TRAIN HAS ALREADY LEFT WASILLA. IT'S HEADING NORTH TOWARDS THE FRONTIER TOWN OF TALKEETNA. BUD MUST DRIVE TO THE STATION AND BOARD THE TRAIN THERE. IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO ACCESS THE REMOTE FAMILY HOMESTEAD IN SHERMAN. THERE'S ALWAYS WORRY. I MEAN, THERE'S RETIREMENT HOMES WHERE YOU HAVE EVERYTHING YOU NEED, ON-STAFF NURSES AND STUFF, AND THIS IS NOT MY MOM AND DAD'S WAY OF LIFE. AND WE DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO HELP THEM UP THERE. I NEED TO GET THESE PILLS UP TO HER RIGHT AWAY. IF I DON'T GET THEM THERE TODAY, THEN SHE'LL BE EXPOSED TO RISK OF HAVING A STROKE AGAIN. SHE NEEDS THEM NOW. I DON'T ANTICIPATE ANY PROBLEMS FOR THE PASSENGER TRAIN. NORMALLY, WE'RE PRETTY MUCH ON TIME. 70 MILES NORTH, IN TALKEETNA... ...ROADMASTER HUGH EVANS IS READYING HIS CREW FOR A DAY OF TRACK REPAIRS. WITH AN ANNOUNCEMENT OF JOB LOSSES EXPECTED SOON, HE WILL BE THE ONE DELIVERING THE BAD NEWS TO ANY OF HIS WORKERS IF THEY'RE LAID OFF. 24 YEARS I'VE WORKED FOR ALASKA RAILROAD, AND I GOT REAL GOOD CREWS THAT WORK ALONG WITH ME. I MEAN, IT'S A PRETTY GOOD RELATIONSHIP. I WORRY ABOUT MY EMPLOYEES OUT HERE. I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THEM. IT'S A BAD TIME FOR ANYONE TO MAKE A SLIP UP ON THE JOB. WE'VE GOT A LOADER HERE WE USE FOR OUR SNOW REMOVAL UP AND DOWN THE RAIL BELT OUT HERE. WHAT HAPPENED IS SOME EXHAUST LUBRICATING FLUID GOT PUT IN THE FUEL TANK ACCIDENTALLY. LOOKS LIKE IT'S A PRETTY EASY MISTAKE TO MAKE. SOMEBODY'S DONE IT BEFORE. IT'S GOT "NO FUEL" WRITTEN ON THE CAP. WE REALLY NEED THIS PIECE OF EQUIPMENT, AND IT'S HAVING TO GO TO ANCHORAGE TO BE REPAIRED. ALL I GOT TO SAY IS, THIS IS PRETTY DEVASTATING RIGHT NOW. THE LOADER IS A VITAL MACHINE IN THE FIGHT TO KEEP THE RAILROAD CLEAR OF SNOW. HUGH NEEDS TO GIVE EMPLOYEE TODD ROBBINS A WRITTEN WARNING FOR THE MIX-UP. THIS IS THE BAD PART OF MY JOB, RIGHT HERE, WHERE I GOT TO DISCIPLINE SOMEBODY. OKAY, BROTHER. YOU KNOW HOW HARD THIS IS FOR ME, THERE. YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES WE GET COMPLACENT. WHENEVER YOU ACCIDENTALLY POURED THE EXHAUST LUBRICANT INTO THE LOADER, YOU KNOW, IT REALLY MESSED US UP. THAT'S A KEY PIECE OF EQUIPMENT WE NEED OUT HERE RIGHT NOW. AFFECTS US ALL. SORRY I HAD TO PUT YOU IN THIS POSITION, HUGH. YEAH, WELL, I GOT THIS DISCIPLINARY LETTER. **** THAT HITS HOME HARD. IT DOES, YOU KNOW. IT'S KIND OF A BUMMER. HIGH-PRIORITY JOB, AND IT'S A BUMMER THAT IT HAPPENED. IT SHOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED, YOU KNOW? HUGH'S AN AWESOME ROADMASTER, ONE OF THE BEST I'VE WORKED WITH. IT'S REALLY HARD ON ME TO LET A GUY DOWN LIKE THIS. I TREAT MY PEOPLE LIKE I LIKE TO BE TREATED. YOU KNOW, THEY'RE ALL MY BROTHERS OUT HERE. IF I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY TO SOMEBODY, I SAY IT. AND IF THEY GET MAD AT ME, YOU KNOW, I TAKE AND MAKE IT ALL GOOD BECAUSE WE NEED TO MOVE ON. 170 MILES SOUTH, IN THE KENAI MOUNTAINS... ...DANNY AND ANIMAL'S FREIGHT TRAIN IS ALMOST HALFWAY ON ITS JOURNEY TO ANCHORAGE. THEY'RE CARRYING 2,000 TONS OF DRILL PIPE FOR A NEW OIL-MINING COMPANY. CLIMBING THE HILL, BABY, CLIMBING THE HILL. THERE ARE MORE THAN 20 BILLION BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL BURIED BENEATH ALASKA'S NORTH SLOPE. PIPE'S ALL ON STILL. YEAH. PIPE'S LOOKING GOOD, RASCHAD. ALL RIGHT. KEEPING 200 DRILL SITES SUPPLIED WITH EQUIPMENT IN THE EXTREME WINTERS IS A CONSTANT BATTLE FOR THE RAILROAD BUT VITAL FOR THE STATE'S ECONOMY. NICE THING ABOUT THE LOOP IS WE CAN ACTUALLY REALLY LOOK AT OUR TRAIN. WE CAN SEE MOST OF IT NOW. **** BEAUTY THAT'S OUT HERE, THAT YOU GET TO SEE. WE'VE ALL BEEN OVER THIS PROBABLY THOUSANDS OF TIMES EACH, BUT YOU NEVER GET USED TO IT. IT'S FABULOUS. 40 MILES AHEAD, FIVE TUNNELS CUT RIGHT THROUGH THE KENAI MOUNTAINS. THIS IS A NOTORIOUS DANGER ZONE, WHERE 30-FOOT-LONG KILLER ICICLES HANG RIGHT ABOVE THE TRACK. ROADMASTER BRUCE GOUGH AND HIS CREW ARE ON THEIR DAILY MISSION TO INSPECT THIS SECTION OF LINE, TO CHECK IT'S SAFE FOR THE FREIGHT TRAIN TO PASS THROUGH. WE HAVE A NORTHBOUND FREIGHT COMING THROUGH. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THE ICE IS CLEAR OF THE TUNNELS. THE ALASKA RAILROAD RIGHT NOW IS GOING THROUGH SOME ECONOMIC CHALLENGES, BUT YOU CAN'T REALLY LET IT AFFECT YOU. YOU STILL HAVE TO KEEP THE LINE OPEN. YOU STILL HAVE TO GET THESE TRAINS SAFELY TO THEIR DESTINATIONS. **** I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THIS ICE HERE... OVERHANG. IT COULD STRIKE OUR TRAINS. ICICLES LIKE THIS CAN WEIGH MORE THAN 20 TONS. IF THEY BREAK FREE, THEY CAN SMASH INTO A PASSING TRAIN AND DERAIL IT. HERE WE GO. THEY'RE TOO HIGH FOR EXCAVATORS TO REACH. THE SOLUTION... SHOOT THEM DOWN. BOY, THAT'S A BIG CHUNK OF ICE. THAT THING'S MASSIVE. I THINK YOU NEED A ROCKET LAUNCHER. THAT'LL DEFINITELY DO SOME DAMAGE TO A TRAIN OR A HIGH RAIL. YEAH. NOW LET'S JUST THROW ONE ROUND IN IT AND SEE WHAT IT DOES. THIS IS A .45-70 RIFLE, AND I'M THINKING THIS MIGHT BE THE TICKET. LET'S SEE HOW GOOD A SHOT YOU ARE. BRUCE HAS ONLY 30 MINUTES TO MAKE THE AREA SAFE BEFORE DANNY AND ANIMAL'S FREIGHT TRAIN ARRIVES. GIVE HER HELL, BRUCE. LET'S MAKE IT LOOK LIKE SUMMERTIME. THAT'S A TOUGH ONE. YEAH. IT'S FAIRLY THICK ICE. YEAH, I THINK YOU'VE GOT YOUR WORK CUT OUT FOR YOU ON THAT ONE. ONE MORE GOOD ONE. I'M GOING TO TRY TO JUST CUT A LITTLE LINE ACROSS IT. **** THING IS PRETTY SOLID. IT MIGHT BE TOO THICK. WE'VE GOT TRAINS COMING. WE NEED TO GET THOSE DOWN. IN THE KENAI MOUNTAINS... COUPLE MORE LOOKS LIKE IT'LL GET IT. ...BRUCE IS BATTLING TO SHOOT DOWN A DEADLY 20-FOOT-LONG ICICLE AND MAKE THE TRACKS SAFE BEFORE DANNY AND ANIMAL'S FREIGHT TRAIN ARRIVES. I THINK I'M HITTING THE RIGHT SPOT. I THINK YOU MIGHT GET IT ON THIS ONE. THE TRAIN'S GETTING CLOSER. THERE SHE GOES. GOOD SHOOTING, BRUCE. THE TRACK IS NOW COMPLETELY BLOCKED WITH HUGE CHUNKS OF ICE. **** Gough: THAT'S A BIG CHUNK. THAT'S MASSIVE. YEAH. THE HARD PART OF THIS IS TO GET THE ICE REMOVED FROM THE DITCH LINE, CLEAR THE TRACKS UP, BECAUSE WE'VE GOT TO GET THIS TRAIN THROUGH. 120 MILES NORTH, BUD HAS CAUGHT UP WITH THE PASSENGER TRAIN. HE NEEDS TO GET AHEAD TO GET ONBOARD AT TALKEETNA. CUT OFF FROM ROADS, THE TRAIN IS THE ONLY WAY TO REACH HIS PARENT'S REMOTE HOMESTEAD TO DELIVER HIS MOM'S MEDICATION. THERE'S NO WAY TO GET TO MOM RIGHT NOW, EXCEPT FOR BY RAILROAD. WE'RE RACING THE TRAIN TO GET THAT STUFF UP TO HER. WE SHOULD GET THERE IN THE NICK OF TIME. AT THE LOVEL'S HOMESTEAD IN SHERMAN, MARY AND CLYDE ARE WAITING FOR BUD TO ARRIVE. THEY'RE PROUD OF THE HOME THEY'VE BUILT HERE, ALL BY HAND, AND DON'T LIKE TO RELY ON ANYONE. YOU CAN'T PLAN WHAT DAY YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE AN EMERGENCY. AN EMERGENCY JUST HAPPENS. OOP! TRIP OVER MY OWN FEET NOW. YEAH. ARE YOU GOING TO GO GET WATER? YEAH. YOU GOING TO TAKE THE PUMP, TOO? I'VE GOT TO REMEMBER WHERE THE HECK IT IS. I THINK IT'S OUT HERE. I THINK SO. I DON'T THINK MANY OF THE YOUNGER GENERATION COULD LIVE OUT HERE. I'M USED TO IT. THIS IS MY WORKSHOP HERE, MY TOOLS, NAILS, AND HANGING STUFF EVERYWHERE. THE WIFE AND KIDS AND I BUILT THIS. USED TO BE FOR COAL YEARS AGO. WE HAD COAL IN HERE. QUITE A BIT OF STORAGE. BEHIND YOU HERE IS MY SAWMILL AND THE OUTHOUSE. THIS IS OUR SHOWER HOUSE HERE. AND AS YOU CAN SEE, IT'S CLOSED FOR THE WINTER. LITTLE BIT TOO CHILLY. AND THEN MY WOODSHED HERE AND THE MAIN HOUSE. TOO MANY PEOPLE TODAY DEPEND ON SOMEBODY ELSE TO DO SOMETHING FOR THEM. IF YOU LIVE OUT HERE, YOU CAN'T DO THAT BECAUSE THERE'S NOBODY TO DO IT BUT YOU. DOWN SOUTH, IN THE KENAI MOUNTAINS... ...AS DANNY AND ANIMAL'S FREIGHT TRAIN APPROACHES THE FIRST OF FIVE TUNNELS, BRUCE AND HIS CREW ARE STILL CLEARING THE ICE FROM THE TRACK AHEAD. HE IS DOING REALLY GOOD. DID YOU HEAR ANYTHING ON THAT TRAIN YET? WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME. LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. YEAH, LET'S GET THIS THING IN THE HOLE. RIGHT NOW, WE'VE DONE OUR JOB. OUR NEXT BIG THING IS JUST GET OFF THE TRACKS AND GET THIS FREIGHT MOVED. THE MOMENT OF TRUTH. YEAH. LET'S SEE WHAT WE GET HERE. IT'S A CRAPSHOOT. YOU TAKE YOUR CHANCES. THAT'S ALL YOU CAN DO. VIBRATIONS FROM THE TRAIN COULD LOOSEN THE ICICLES ABOVE THEIR HEADS. SEE ALL THAT ICE? **** TO REDUCE THE RISK OF AN ICICLE HIT, THEY SLOW DOWN TO LESS THAN 10 MILES AN HOUR. I GET WAY MORE CONCERNED WITH THIS **** THAN WHAT'S INSIDE THEM TUNNELS. **** THAT STUFF THERE, GREAT BIG ICICLES. IT'S A LITTLE UNNERVING SOMETIMES TRAVELING UNDERNEATH THAT. SOME OF THAT ICE UP THERE IS 30, 40 FEET LONG, FIVE FEET THICK. I'D SAY SOME OF THAT COULD BE EASILY 20 TONS. EASILY. IT COULD BREAK LOOSE, CUT THROUGH THIS CAB LIKE A KNIFE GOING THROUGH BUTTER. WATER SEEPING THROUGH HOLES IN THE TUNNEL'S WALLS FREEZES SOLID, CREATING EVEN MORE ICICLES. I'VE ACTUALLY HAD ICE COME DOWN AND TEAR THE MIRRORS OFF A LOCOMOTIVE. LOOK AT THAT ICE CHUNK. YIKES. I SEE THE LIGHT. YEAH. JOB WELL DONE. WE ARE NORTH OF TUNNEL. Thank you very much. 10-80 out. 150 MILES NORTH, JUST OUTSIDE TALKEETNA, BUD LOVEL IS STILL TRYING TO CATCH UP WITH THE PASSENGER TRAIN. SOUNDS LIKE THE TRAIN'S ALREADY UP ON THE HILL. I'M GOING TO HAVE TO HURRY TO GET THESE PILLS UP THE TRACKS. IF HE MISSES IT, HIS MOTHER, MARY, WON'T GET HER MEDICATION. THE NEXT TRAIN ISN'T FOR ANOTHER WEEK. ALL ABOARD! IN THE NICK OF TIME. MR. HARRY, IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU, SIR. HOW YOU DOING? EXCELLENT. ALL RIGHT. GOING UP TO THE CABIN TONIGHT? YEAH, I'VE GOT TO TAKE SOME MEDS UP TO MOM. SHE FORGOT SOME MEDS, SO... A TICKET FOR YOU. AWESOME. THANK YOU, SIR. AND YOU CAN LOAD UP. ALL RIGHT. 20 MILES UP THE TRACK, NEAR CURRY... ...ROADMASTER HUGH EVANS, TOGETHER WITH BROTHERS ANTHONY AND MIKE HOADLEY, ARE CARRYING OUT A TRACK INSPECTION IN CONVOY. THEY'RE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR ANY PROBLEMS ON THE LINE THAT COULD STOP THE PASSENGER TRAIN. I LOVE MY JOB. SOMETIMES I GET CALLED OUT TO GO CHECK OUT ROUGH TRACK OR GET CALLED OUT TO HELP WITH A MOOSE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, SO I SPEND A LOT OF TIME OUT HERE. YEAH, I DON'T GET MUCH SLEEP. THE TRACK CREWS ARE CRITICAL TO KEEPING THE TRAINS ROLLING DURING THE WINTER. LAST YEAR, THE RAILROAD SPENT $36 MILLION REPAIRING THE LINES. I'D HATE TO BE OUT HERE RISKING MY LIFE ONLY TO, I GUESS, BE THANKED BY LOSING MY JOB. THEY'RE LOOKING TO MAKE A CUT IN THE WORKFORCE, SO I JUST HOPE THAT I'VE BEEN HERE LONG ENOUGH TO NOT BE ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT GETS CUT. **** WHAT HAVE WE GOT UP HERE? I'M STOPPING. OVER. THE NORTHBOUND PASSENGER TRAIN CARRYING BUD IS ONLY 40 MINUTES AWAY FROM HUGH. WELL, WE'VE GOT AN ELECTRIC SWITCH, AND THINGS DON'T LOOK RIGHT, SO I'M GOING TO GET OUT, TAKE A LOOK WHAT'S GOING ON HERE. IF THE SWITCH IS BROKEN, THE TRAIN CAN'T PASS, AND BUD WON'T BE ABLE TO DELIVER THE MUCH-NEEDED MEDICINE TO HIS MOTHER. HOLY **** THIS IS WHAT DERAILS TRAINS RIGHT HERE. JUST OUTSIDE TALKEETNA, BUD IS HEADING NORTH TO SHERMAN TO DELIVER HIS MOTHER'S BLOOD PRESSURE MEDICATION, UNAWARE THAT TRACK PROBLEMS LIE AHEAD. HARRY, HOW ARE WE DOING ON TRAIN TIME HERE TODAY? WE ARE ON TIME. WE'RE RIGHT ON THE MONEY. IN SHERMAN, 84-YEAR-OLD CLYDE LOVEL HAS BEEN OUT GATHERING WATER FOR MORE THAN TWO HOURS. SO I GOT ABOUT 50 POUNDS IN EACH ONE OF THESE. TAKES A LOT OF STAMINA. I'M USED TO IT. I HAD A HEART ATTACK TWO YEARS AGO. THERE. MY KIDS ALL FUSS NOW TO GET OUT OF HERE. "WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU DIE?" CAN'T LIVE FOR SOMEONE ELSE. YOU'VE GOT TO LIVE YOUR OWN. THAT'S THE WAY LIFE IS. HIS WIFE, MARY, IS WORRIED. CLYDE? CLYDE, WHERE ARE YOU? CLYDE HAD A HEART ATTACK NOT TOO LONG AGO. IF HE'S DELAYED FOR ANY REASON, I ALWAYS WORRY. CLYDE, WHERE ARE YOU? WHEN YOU'RE A PARENT AND YOU HAVE KIDS, YOU KNOW, YOU WORRY ABOUT YOUR KIDS. AND NOW, US KIDS ARE WORRIED ABOUT OUR PARENTS. THEY COULD FALL, AND THAT COULD BE IT. SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS THAT COULD KILL THEM. LOTS OF FUN. CLYDE! I THINK MARY WORRIES A LOT ABOUT US, PARTICULARLY WHEN WE'VE SAID WE'D BE BACK AT A CERTAIN TIME, AND MAYBE WE GET ENJOYING WHAT WE WERE DOING, OR WE JUST GET BUSY AND FORGET. THERE HE IS. I THINK A COUPLE TIMES, SHE ACTUALLY CAME OUT ON SNOWSHOES AND READ US THE RIOT ACT. THERE YOU ARE. LUNCH IS READY. COME ON. CAN I GO TO BED NOW? 30 MILES SOUTH, AT CURRY... HOLY **** THIS IS WHAT DERAILS TRAINS RIGHT HERE. THE POINT'S GAPPED. THIS IS AN ELECTRIC SWITCH, AND THINGS ARE NOT RIGHT. ...HUGH'S CREW MUST FIX THIS FAULTY SWITCH FAST, OR IT WILL WRECK BUD'S CHANCES OF GETTING TO HIS PARENT'S HOMESTEAD. HOLY **** YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I SAID. THAT'S **** UP. I KNOW. THE SWITCH IS GETTING OUT OF **** CONTROL. THANK GOD WE'RE HERE TO FIX IT NOW. A GAPPED POINT WILL PUT A TRAIN ON THE GROUND. WE CAN'T DRIVE OVER IT UNTIL WE GET IT FIXED. BACK IN 2004, ENGINEERS INSTALLED A $62 MILLION HEATED TRACK SWITCHING SYSTEM TO MOVE TRAINS BETWEEN LINES. BUT THE HEATING ON THIS SWITCH HAS BROKEN. ICE IS BLOCKING THE TRACK FROM CONNECTING TO THE MAIN LINE, LEAVING A TWO-INCH GAP THAT WILL DERAIL THE TRAIN. I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND CHECK THE HEAT SENSOR TO SEE IF I CAN GET THE HEATER TO KICK ON. OKAY, SOUNDS GOOD. YOU GOT YOUR KEYS? NOT KICKING ON. NOTHING? YES. DOWN IN THE KENAI MOUNTAINS... ...DANNY AND ANIMAL'S FREIGHT TRAIN IS HEADING TOWARDS BRUCE'S TRACK CREW, WHO ARE IN POSITION TO CHECK THAT THEIR LOCOMOTIVES AND $10 MILLION LOAD OF OIL PIPES HAVE NOT BEEN DAMAGED BY FALLING ICE. I SEE THE PIPE. THEY'RE GOING TO CHECK OUR TRAIN OUT FOR US. HOPEFULLY EVERYTHING LOOKS GOOD. ROLL BY LOOKED GOOD. 12-49 TO DAN FORSMAN. OVER. YES, SIR. DAN, YOUR ROLL BY LOOKED GOOD ON BOTH SIDES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. APPRECIATE ALL THE HELP. YOU GUYS HAVE A SAFE DAY. THANKS, DAN. HAVE A GOOD TRIP. BRUCE OUT. IT'S NICE TO HAVE SOMEBODY LOOK AT OUR TRAIN. OBVIOUSLY, WE CAN'T SEE IT ALL. SO IT'S KIND OF NICE FOR THEM TO BE OUT THERE AND BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING'S LOOKING GOOD. MOOSE. MOOSE! **** MOOSE! RIGHT IN FRONT OF US. RIGHT IN FRONT OF US. IT'S 3:00 P.M. DANNY AND ANIMAL ARE ON THE LAST STAGE OF THEIR MISSION... HAULING $10 MILLION WORTH OF DRILL PIPE NORTH TO ANCHORAGE FOR A NEW CUSTOMER. MOOSE. MOOSE! **** MOOSE! RIGHT IN FRONT OF US. RIGHT IN FRONT OF US.! SEE, IT'LL GO RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU HERE. WE GOT LUCKY THERE. GOOD JOB, RASCHAD, SLOWING HER DOWN. SAVED THE LIFE OF THAT THING. IT WAS A HEALTHY-LOOKING SPECIMEN. THAT WAS A BIG MOOSE. IF IT WENT DOWN AND WENT UNDER, WE'D HAVE TO STOP, PULL IT OUT. IT'D PROBABLY BE GROUND UP ON THE TRACTION MOTORS, UNDERNEATH THESE MOTORS, WHICH COULD LEAD TO BIG DELAYS AND LOTS OF UNPLEASANT WORK. IT'S KIND OF GORY SOMETIMES. I MEAN, WE'VE HAD TO GO UNDERNEATH, AND YOU'VE GOT TO ACTUALLY GO GET THEM OUT FROM UNDERNEATH YOUR TRAIN. IT'S NOT A VERY PLEASANT THING TO DO. I PULLED MOOSE WHERE THE SHANK CAME OUT OF HIS SOCKET, AND I WENT OVER THE SIDE OF THE BANK AND WENT DOWN WITH THING IN MY ARMS, SPEWING NASTY ALL OVER ME AND IT, AND THE BOYS THAT WERE THERE TO HELP WERE LAUGHING QUITE HARD ABOUT IT. BUT, YOU KNOW **** HAPPENS, AND THEN YOU JUST GOT TO DEAL WITH IT. BUD IS HEADING NORTH TO SHERMAN ON THE PASSENGER TRAIN, CARRYING URGENT MEDICATION FOR HIS MOM. AWESOME. ON THE TRACK AHEAD... I'M GOING TO START DIGGING IT OUT. ...ROADMASTER HUGH EVANS AND HIS CREW ARE CLEARING ICE FROM A FAULTY SWITCH AS FAST AS THEY CAN. HOPEFULLY THE SWITCH AIN'T BROKE. MIKE CAN'T CLOSE THE SWITCH TO CONNECT THE TRACK TO THE MAIN LINE. THE ICE IS STILL JAMMING IT OPEN. SOMETHING'S HOLDING IT UP. **** LET ME SEE THAT. **** THERE IT GOES. GOOD POINT. IT WORKS GOOD NOW. I'VE GOT A GOOD POINT. WITH THE SWITCH MADE SAFE, HUGH AND HIS CREW MOVE OUT OF THE WAY TO ALLOW THE PASSENGER TRAIN THROUGH. ALL RIGHT. GOOD JOB. WE'RE KEEPING THIS STATE RUNNING. YOU'VE GOT TO WANT TO BE HERE. I GUESS THE GOOD STUFF OUTWEIGHS THE BAD. AND SOME OF THE PEOPLE YOU WORK WITH, I MEAN, IT'S GREAT TO WORK WITH THEM. A GOOD WORKING DAY IS GOING OUT, MY PEOPLE GOING HOME SAFELY AT THE END OF THE DAY. WHEN THEY LEAVE HERE WITH ALL THEIR FINGERS AND TOES, I'M HAPPY. AFTER TWO AND A HALF HOURS, BUD FINALLY MAKES IT TO HIS FAMILY'S HOMESTEAD. SO THIS IS ALL MY YARD FOR ABOUT 100 SQUARE MILES. LIKE THEIR FOREFATHERS, ALASKANS ARE STILL ABLE TO STAKE A CLAIM FOR LAND IN AMERICA'S LARGEST STATE. AND THAT WILL DO, 4-3-2-8. BUT NOT EVERYONE HAS THE RAILROAD TRAVELING THROUGH THEIR FRONT YARD. COME ON DOWN, MR. BUD. ALL RIGHT. WELL, THANK YOU, HARRY. TAKE CARE. ALL RIGHTY. MR. LOVEL... HE RIDES ALL THE TIME. HIS FAMILY GREW UP THERE. I DO ADMIRE HIM. I KNOW I WOULDN'T DO IT BECAUSE I LIKE MY FLUSHING TOILETS AND HOT SHOWERS, AND ALL OF THAT OTHER STUFF THAT THEY DON'T HAVE OUT THERE. HEY, MOM! WHAT WE DO UNDERSTAND OUT HERE IS THAT THERE ARE RISKS. HEY, MOM. MOM HAD A STROKE OUT HERE, AND THAT WAS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. MOM! YOU UP THERE? AND WE FULL KNOW THAT ONE DAY WE MAY GET THE CALL THAT DAD IS NOT COMING BACK FROM OUT CUTTING A TREE DOWN. YOU KNOW, YOU JUST DEAL WITH IT DAY BY DAY. HEY, MOM! YEAH, IS THAT YOU, BUD? YEAH. I'M SO GLAD YOU CAME. I GOT THE PILLS FOR YOU, MOM. ALL RIGHT. JUST MADE IT TO THE TRAIN IN TIME TO GET ON. THANK YOU, HONEY. YEAH. CAREFUL COMING DOWN THERE. YEAH. WELL, I'M GLAD I GOT HERE. YEAH. I WAS PRETTY SCARED. I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO BE IN TROUBLE THERE, BUT IT WAS ALL GOOD. GET YOU SOME OF THOSE IN THERE. I'M REALLY, REALLY GLAD THAT BUD CAME AND WENT TO ALL THE TROUBLE TO PICK THESE UP FOR ME. I'M A HAPPY CAMPER. 150 MILES SOUTH, JUST OUTSIDE ANCHORAGE, DANNY AND ANIMAL ARE ON SCHEDULE WITH THEIR HOT FREIGHT OF DRILL PIPE. THESE ARE VERY HOT LOADS, SO THIS IS A HUGE THING FOR US. WE SHOULD MAKE TOWN JUST BY THE HAIR OF OUR CHINNY-CHIN-CHIN. **** WHAT HAPPENED? DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT'S WHAT. WE'RE GOING TO GET OFF AND TAKE A LOOK. 3:30 P.M. DANNY AND ANIMAL ARE SEVEN MILES FROM THE TRAIN YARD IN ANCHORAGE WITH THEIR 2,000 TONS OF DRILL PIPE. **** WHAT HAPPENED? WE'VE GOT A DEFECT. DEFECT DETECTOR JUST TRIPPED A DEFECT. DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT'S WHAT, SO WE'RE GOING TO GET OFF AND TAKE A LOOK. WOW. A WHEEL. CHECK THE ALARM. GOT HOT WHEELS. ON A MISSION, BOYS. THE ALASKA RAILROAD HAS SPECIAL DETECTORS ON THE TRACKS. THEY MONITOR PASSING TRAINS FOR PROBLEMS, FROM UNBALANCED LOADS TO HOT WHEELS, TRIGGERING AN ALARM IN THE LOCOMOTIVE IF THEY PICK UP A DEFECT. YEAH, I CAN SMELL IT. IT'S **** HOT ENOUGH TO **** OVER HERE. THOSE BRAKE SHOES ARE HOTTER THAN HELL. THE BRAKE PADS ON ONE OF THE CARS HAVE LOCKED ON AND STUCK TO THE WHEELS, CAUSING THEM TO OVERHEAT TO 440 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT. I'LL TRY TO WORK IT HERE, AND THEN HOPEFULLY IT'LL BE OKAY. **** OKAY. THERE WE GO. SOME REASON, THE AIR WAS HANGING UP ON THE CAR A LITTLE BIT, CAUSING THE BRAKES TO STICK. ANIMAL HAS EASED THE BRAKE SHOES OFF THE WHEELS, BUT THE AIR-BRAKE SYSTEM ON THIS CAR IS STILL NOT WORKING PROPERLY. THERE'S A RISK THE BRAKES COULD LOCK BACK ON ONCE THE TRAIN GETS MOVING. HEY, ANIMAL? LET'S CUT THE **** AIR OUT OF IT. YEAH. HELLO, 40-16. THESE SHOES, THEY ARE HOT. BEARINGS ARE NOT. THE AIR WILL BE CUT OUT OF THE 12-6-2-7. You can cut the air out. WE'RE GOING TO CUT THE AIR OUT OF THIS CAR TO MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE BRAKES TO APPLY. THEY'RE CLOSE ENOUGH TO ANCHORAGE TO DISENGAGE THE BRAKE SYSTEM ON THIS ONE CAR. ANIMAL! AIR'S CUT OUT. YOU'RE CLEAR? YOU'RE FINISHED WITH WHAT YOU'RE DOING? YEAH, IT'S ALL RELEASED. WE CUT THE CAR OUT SO NO AIR COULD GO THROUGH THE BRAKE SYSTEM ON THAT CAR ANYMORE AND TOOK CARE OF THAT PROBLEM. ONCE IT GETS TO ANCHORAGE, IT'S GOING TO ORDERED AND BE FIXED. WE GOT IT TAKEN CARE OF. READY AHEAD WHEN YOU'RE READY. AFTER SEVEN HOURS, DANNY AND ANIMAL FINALLY MAKE IT WITH THE DRILL PIPES TO ANCHORAGE. 4,012, ANCHORAGE YARD, ON CHANNEL FIVE. WE'VE MADE IT TO TOWN. A COUPLE MINUTES TO SPARE. PULLING INTO THE YARD NOW. PIPE'S VERY, VERY HOT. THE MAIN THING IS WE GOT THE TRAIN HERE. CUSTOMER WILL BE HAPPY. YES, I THINK SO. BLIND-DOG LUCK ONCE AGAIN. NEVER UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER OF THE PIPE. EVERYBODY CONCERNED WITH THIS NEW BUSINESS WILL BE SMILING. ALL IN ALL, A JOB WELL DONE, AND EVERYTHING LOOKS REALLY GOOD. ANYTHING THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE OIL INDUSTRY IS REAL IMPORTANT TO THIS RAILROAD. IT'S ALL GOOD REVENUE. IF WE GET THE MONIES FROM THAT, MORE PEOPLE HAVE WORK. THIS SHOULD PROVE TO BE VERY VALUABLE TO THIS RAILROAD. IT'S GOING TO BE AWESOME. YEAH. OUT OF HERE, WE ARE. YES, WE ARE. IT'S BEEN A GOOD DAY FOR DANNY AND ANIMAL. **** BUT HUGH'S DAY ENDS WITH BAD NEWS. AFTER MORE THAN 20 YEARS WORKING ON THE ALASKA RAILROAD, HE'S JUST HEARD THAT HE IS ONE OF 29 WORKERS BEING LAID OFF. **** **** IT'S PART OF THE RAILROAD'S BID TO CUT COSTS BY $4.5 MILLION. **** HAVING HUGH GET REMOVED, IT SHOCKED ALL OF US. YOU KNOW, THAT'S... HE'S THE LAST ROADMASTER I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED TO GET CUT. I'M SURE HE'S NOT HAPPY ABOUT IT. I WOULDN'T BE. AT HOME, HUGH'S BREAKING THE NEWS TO HIS WIFE, LAUREN. WE STILL HAVEN'T EVEN TOLD MY DAUGHTER, BECAUSE WHAT AM I GOING TO SAY? YOU KNOW, "SORRY YOU WANT TO GO TO COLLEGE, BUT I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN NOW"? I DON'T... I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO TELL HER, BUT I'VE GOT TO TELL HER BEFORE SOMEBODY ELSE DOES. YOU'RE TOLD YOUR JOB IS ABOLISHED, AND YOU'VE PUT IN 24 YEARS OF BLOOD, SWEAT, AND TEARS OUT HERE, YOU KNOW, MAKING THE RAILROAD A BETTER PLACE TO RUN TRAINS ON, YOU KNOW, TO SUPPORT THE PEOPLE IN ALASKA, AND YOU'RE TOLD YOUR JOB IS NO LONGER. MY FIRST REACTION WAS TO BE PISSED. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? WHY BE ANGRY? I'VE GOT TO MOVE ON. HIS FUTURE ISN'T LINED OUT ANYMORE. HE'S HAVING A HARD TIME. BUT HE'S GOT A BUNCH OF IRONS IN THE FIRE. SHOOT. IT'S ALL RIGHT. IT'LL BE GOOD. IT'LL BE FINE.
