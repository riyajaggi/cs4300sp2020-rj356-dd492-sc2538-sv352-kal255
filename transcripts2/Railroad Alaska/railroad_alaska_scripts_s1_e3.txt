 HOPEFULLY WE DIDN'T MISS THE TRAIN. REMOTE SETTLERS WILL BE STRANDED. IF SOMEBODY DOESN'T WORRY, THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH THEM. THEIR LIVES ARE ON THE LINE. I DO WORRY ABOUT LEAVING MY PREGNANT WIFE AT HOME WHEN I GO INTO TOWN. IF I WENT INTO LABOR, I'M NOT SURE WHAT I WOULD DO. THE PORT OF SEWARD, THE SOUTHERNMOST POINT ON THE ALASKA RAILROAD. BARGES CARRYING FREIGHT FROM AROUND THE WORLD ARRIVE HERE DAILY. IT'S 8:00 A.M. ABOUT 30 FEET.

 RAIL CREW DANNY AND ANIMAL ARE HOOKING TOGETHER A MILE-LONG TRAIN CARRYING TONS OF TIMBER. THERE'S 14 MILLION POUNDS OF LUMBER INSURED FOR $5 MILLION. THAT'S NOT CHUMP CHANGE. FIVE FEET. STOP. THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR PUTTING THE FREIGHT TOGETHER AND FIXING ANY ENGINEERING PROBLEMS THEY MIGHT ENCOUNTER EN ROUTE, ENSURING ALL 76 RAIL CARS ARE DELIVERED SAFELY. NICE AND EASY. I FILL THE FREIGHT, GET THEM OUT OF HERE, GET THEM TO ANCHORAGE, AND BE INVOLVED WITH THE DELIVERY TO THE CUSTOMER. BUSINESS IS BOOMING IN ANCHORAGE. WITH TWO MAJOR RETAIL STORES UNDER CONSTRUCTION, THESE SUPPLIES ARE IN HOT DEMAND. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE GET THIS STUFF UP THERE. GET IT ON TIME AND GET GOING WITH IT. AS I'M WALKING DOWN BY THESE RAIL CARS, I'M DOUBLE CHECKING TO MAKE SURE THEY'VE SECURED ALL THE LOADS TO THE CAR. WE DON'T WANT TO LOSE ANY OF THESE LOADS GOING NORTH TO ANCHORAGE. THESE STRAPS ARE **** SUPER COOL, JUST THE WAY IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE. LOOKING GOOD SO FAR. SO FAR, SO GOOD. THE ONE-MILE INSPECTION COMPLETE, DANNY AND ANIMAL ARE READY TO GO. NEED TO ROCK AND ROLL. HERE WE GO. IT'S NOW 9:00 A.M. THEY HAVE A SEVEN-HOUR JOURNEY AHEAD THAT WILL TAKE THEM THROUGH WOODLAND FORESTS, HEAVILY POPULATED BY MOOSE. OVER THE KENAI MOUNTAINS TO ANCHORAGE, THEY WANT TO ARRIVE BY NIGHTFALL. WE ONLY HAVE 76 CARS, RIGHT? YUP. HEAVY. FEEL IT ALREADY. THIS TRAIN IS SO HEAVY AT OVER 6,500 TONS, IT NEEDS FOUR LOCOMOTIVES TO PULL IT ALONG, THREE AT THE FRONT AND ONE AT THE REAR, ALL CONTROLLED BY BILL, THE ENGINEER. THE STEEP GRADIENTS AND TIGHT BENDS ALONG THE KENAI MOUNTAIN ROUTE MAKES THIS AMERICA'S MOST DANGEROUS RAILROAD. OUR FEELINGS FOR TODAY ARE NOTHING BUT POSITIVE. EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE SWEET ALL THE WAY TO TOWN. WE'VE ALREADY SPREAD OUR BONDING SPELL AMONG US, SO THINGS WILL BE GOOD. I'M STILL WAITING FOR THE BONDING SPELL TO HIT. HERE, MOOSE. WE'VE ENTERED AN AREA WHERE THERE'S LOTS OF MOOSE, SO WE'RE KIND OF WATCHING OUT RIGHT NOW. MOOSE HAVE A HABIT OF GETTING ON THE RAIL BECAUSE IT'S A CLEAR PATHWAY FOR THEM TO WALK. WHEN THEY MIX WITH US, IT'S... THEY ALWAYS END UP ON THE WRONG END. IF THEY DON'T GET OUT OF THE WAY, THEN THEY'RE KILLED OUTRIGHT, WHICH IS A SHAME, BUT IT HAPPENS. MOOSE ARE A REAL DANGER. IN A TYPICAL WINTER, MORE THAN 100 ARE KILLED ON THE ALASKA RAILROAD. WEIGHING OVER 1200 POUNDS, THEY CAN DERAIL TRAINS WHEN THEY GET HIT CROSSING THE TRACKS. AND WE ACTUALLY HIT TWO OF THEM ONE NIGHT, AND THEY ACTUALLY WENT UNDERNEATH THE ENGINES AND SCARED THE LIVING HELL OUT OF ME BECAUSE THE ENGINES ACTUALLY LIFTED UP AT 40 MILES AN HOUR. I THOUGHT WE WERE GONNA DERAIL AND JUST GO... SCATTERED ALL OVER THE PLACE. PRETTY WILD. **** GO, GO, GO, GO, GO. BOY, THAT WAS CLOSE, MAN. TWO HUNDRED MILES NORTH, NEAR TALKEETNA... NEWLYWEDS AMANDA AND KENNY SIMPSON HAVE BEEN LIVING OFF GRID FOR SIX MONTHS. THEY MOVED FROM TALKEETNA, WHERE THEY GREW UP, AND NOW LIVE 30 MILES FROM THE TOWN IN A CABIN OWNED BY AMANDA'S FATHER. ALONG WITH THE USUAL CHALLENGES OF LIVING OFF GRID, AMANDA IS DUE TO GIVE BIRTH IN JUST TWO WEEKS. THE RAILROAD IS THEIR ONLY LINK TO THE MEDICAL ATTENTION SHE WILL NEED. IT TAKES A CERTAIN KIND OF PERSON TO LIVE OUT HERE. YOU KNOW, THE COUNTRY, THE TERRAIN IS PRETTY, PRETTY TOUGH. AND IF YOU COULD FIND SOMEONE TO LIVE IN THE WOODS WITH YOU, YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT 'CAUSE THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN OFTEN. THEY DON'T CARE. JUST PEAS, AND POTATOES AND LEMONS IN THERE. THEY'RE JUST EATING IT ALL. WHO NEEDS A GARBAGE DISPOSAL WHEN YOU GOT TWO DOGS? I'M VERY PROUD OF MY INDEPENDENCE OUT HERE. I'M LIVING MY DREAM. WE PLAN ON RAISING OUR KID OFF GRID. I WAS RAISED THAT WAY. IT JUST KIND OF BECOMES NATURAL, LIKE LIVING IN THE CITY SEEMS LIKE A VERY FOREIGN IDEA FOR US. BUT PEOPLE PAY A PRICE TO LIVE OUT IN THE WOODS. SOME PEOPLE MOVE OUT HERE AND GO CRAZY. SOME PEOPLE MOVE OUT HERE AND CHOP THEIR HEAD OPEN WITH A CHAINSAW. SOME PEOPLE MOVE OUT HERE AND BLOW THEIR HAND OFF. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? IT HAPPENS. IT HAPPENS. WITH JUST TWO WEEKS UNTIL THEIR BABY IS DUE, KENNY IS TAKING ON ONE MORE WEEK OF WORK BACK NEAR TALKEETNA. KENNY'S OFTEN GONE FOR WEEKS AT A TIME DOING CONSTRUCTION. I DO WORRY ABOUT LEAVING MY PREGNANT WIFE AT HOME WHEN I GO INTO TOWN TO WORK. DON'T GO INTO LABOR. DON'T DO ANYTHING TOO STRENUOUS. WHILE HER HUSBAND IS AWAY, AMANDA'S BEST FRIEND, SHANDI, IS VISITING FROM TALKEETNA WITH HER BABY DAUGHTER, KEROINE, TO LOOK AFTER HER. SEE YOU IN A WEEK. BYE. ME AND AMANDA HAVE BEEN FRIENDS SINCE WE WERE EIGHT YEARS OLD. WE WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL AND GRADUATED TOGETHER. WE'RE PRETTY CLOSE. NOW WE ARE HAVING KIDS TOGETHER, AND THEY'RE GONNA GROW UP TOGETHER. I KNOW MY FAMILY WERE ALL WORRIED ABOUT IT WHEN I DECIDED TO COME OUT HERE AND STAY WITH YOU. THEY WERE LIKE, "NO, YOU CAN'T. YOU JUST HAVE A ONE MONTH OLD." IT'S, LIKE, "NO, IT'LL BE FINE." BUT DESPITE HER FAMILY'S WARNINGS, IN SHANDI'S RACE TO MAKE IT TO AMANDA'S CABIN, SHE HAS FORGOTTEN TO PACK BABY FORMULA. DOESN'T LOOK LIKE I BROUGHT ANY. SHANDI CAN'T STAY HERE WITHOUT FORMULA. SHE'LL NEED TO GET TO A STORE. BUT THE NEAREST IS 30 MILES AWAY, AND THE GUYS HAVE TAKEN THE SNOWMOBILES. YOU COULD PROBABLY CATCH THE FLAG STOP TRAIN INTO TOWN. WHAT TIME DOES IT GET HERE? WE SHOULD, LIKE, PACK YOU UP AND HEAD YOU DOWN THERE. YOU COULD STILL CATCH IT. ALL RIGHT. I SHOULD PROBABLY GET GOING? YEAH. I NEED TO GET HER DRESSED UP. SHANDI HOPES TO CATCH THE HURRICANE TURN PASSENGER TRAIN, WHICH IN WINTER RUNS MONTHLY BETWEEN ANCHORAGE AND HURRICANE. IT'S THE LAST FLAG STOP TRAIN SERVICE IN AMERICA. IT'S 10:00 A.M. THE NORTHBOUND TRAIN WILL BE PASSING AT 11:00. IT CAN DROP HER OFF IN TALKEETNA BY 1:00 P.M. WHILE SHE RUNS TO THE STORE, THE TRAIN WILL CONTINUE NORTH TO HURRICANE, WHERE IT WILL TURN AROUND AND HEAD BACK DOWN SOUTH. SHANDI CAN THEN PICK UP THE TRAIN AGAIN AT 3:00 P.M. AND RETURN HOME TO AMANDA BEFORE IT GETS DARK. IT'S 20 DEGREES, AND SNOW IS STARTING TO FALL. BYE. BYE. BE SAFE. YOU TOO. I DON'T REALLY WANT TO THINK ABOUT IT IF I WENT INTO LABOR 'CAUSE I JUST DON'T KNOW... I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT I WOULD DO OUT HERE BY MYSELF. I'M NOT SURE WHAT I WOULD DO. TO REACH THE RAILROAD TRACK, SHANDI WILL HAVE TO WALK WITH HER BABY GIRL, KEROINE, FOR TWO MILES. I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT BEING ALONE BY MYSELF. I'VE SEEN WOLVES. TWO YEARS AGO, A YOUNG WOMAN WAS MAULED TO DEATH BY WOLVES IN WOODS NOT FAR FROM HERE. I HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN STALKED BY A WOLF IN THESE WOODS. YOU COULD TELL SOMETHING WAS THERE. IT WAS REALLY FRIGHTENING BECAUSE, LIKE, I COULD HEAR, LIKE, HIM WALKING THROUGH THE WOODS. AND I COULDN'T SEE IT, BUT I CAN HEAR IT AND I COULD HEAR IT BREATHING. IT WAS REALLY SCARY. STILL GOT A LONG WAY TO GO. SHANDI McEWEN IS ON HER WAY TO THE RAILROAD TRACK TO FLAG DOWN THE PASSENGER TRAIN TO THE NEAREST TOWN, TALKEETNA, 30 MILES AWAY. HER FRIEND AMANDA WHO IS DUE TO GIVE BIRTH IN JUST TWO WEEKS, ANXIOUSLY AWAITS HER RETURN. I'M JUST TRYING TO KEEP MYSELF BUSY, NOT THINKING ABOUT THE SITUATION RIGHT NOW, HOPING SHANDI MAKES IT TO TOWN OKAY AND BACK. AND I DON'T HAVE A BABY. SHANDI NEEDS TO BUY FORMULA FOR HER BABY GIRL, KEROINE. I HAVE TO WALK TWO MILES ON A NOT REALLY WELL PACKED TRAIL. WELL, I'VE ALREADY GONE A MILE, AND IT KEEPS SNOWING SO THE TRAIL IS GETTING WORSE. SO I'M REALLY HOPING THAT IT KIND OF STOPS SNOWING 'CAUSE IT'S GONNA TAKE ME A LOT LONGER THAN I EXPECTED. TEN MILES NORTH OF SHANDI ON THE TRACK TO TALKEETNA, ROADMASTER HUGH EVANS IS ON HIS DAILY TRACK INSPECTION. HE FACES A NEVER ENDING BATTLE TO KEEP HIS SECTION OF THE RAILROAD OPEN, NO MATTER WHAT MOTHER NATURE MIGHT THROW AT IT. IF HE SPOTS ANY PROBLEMS, HE'LL HAVE TO STOP THE PASSENGER TRAIN, LEAVING SHANDI STRANDED. WE'VE HAD LOTS OF RAIN HERE IN THE PAST COUPLE OF DAYS, REALLY PLAYING HAVOC ON THE TRACK OUT HERE, CAUSING THE WATER TO FLOW OVER THE RAIL AND FREEZING AT NIGHT. WE GOT A TRAIN COMING BY WITHIN THE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS THROUGH THIS AREA HEADED NORTH, SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS SAFE FOR THEIR PASSAGE, AND GET 'ER DONE. SHOOT. I WANT TO GET OUT AND TAKE A LOOK AT THIS SPOT. IT'S NOT LOOKING GOOD. OKAY **** WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM HERE. I'M LOOKING AT THE ICE BUILDUP ALONG THE RAIL. RIGHT NOW, IT'S A INCH... TWO INCHES HIGHER THAN THE HEAD OF THE RAIL. WE GOT TO GET IT DUG DOWN BELOW THE BASE OF THE RAIL. WHEN IT RAINS DURING WARMER PERIODS OF THE DAY, WATER POURS DOWN THE MOUNTAINS. IT POOLS IN DITCHES BY THE TRACKS, WHERE AT NIGHT, IT FREEZES SOLID. IF TOO MUCH WATER BUILDS UP, CONCRETE-LIKE ICE CAN GROW OVER THE RAILS, BLOCKING THE TRACKS COMPLETELY IF IT'S NOT DUG BACK. IT COULD DERAIL A TRAIN AS IT'S GOING THROUGH HERE, SO I'M REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS. YEAH, WE'RE STILL HOT. OVER. ON FIVE. OVER. THIS ICE HAS DEFINITELY GOTTEN OUT OF HAND HERE, SO WE NEED TO COME UP HERE AND TAKE CARE OF THIS SPOT. Roger. YEAH, ROGER THAT, HUGH. BE PRETTY SLEEK OUT HERE TODAY. WE NEED TO GET THIS ONE TAKEN CARE OF. OVER. SOUNDS LIKE A JOB FOR THE "DREAM TEAM." TWELVE MILES SOUTH OF TALKEETNA, VETERAN HOMESTEADERS JIM AND NANCY JAMES HAVE MORE CREATURE COMFORTS THAN MOST OFF-GRIDDERS. BUT IT HAS TAKEN THEM NEARLY 20 YEARS TO BUILD EVERYTHING THEMSELVES. THIS IS OUR HOMESTEAD, WHAT WE CALL SOMETIMES OUR CABIN. THIS IS THE BIG HOUSE. WE HAVE TWO BEDROOMS, WHICH IS UNUSUAL FOR THE BUSH. BEHIND THAT WE GOT THE WOODSHEDS, AND THEN THE NEXT ONE WAS THAT POLE BARN. AND THAT IS WHERE WE BUTCHER MEAT. I FORGOT ALL ABOUT THE OLD OUTHOUSE DOWN THERE. WE USE BLUE STYROFOAM TO INSULATE OUR BOTTOMS. IT'S COMFORTABLE. IF YOU PUT A DOOR ON IT AND THEN YOU GET A BIG, BROWN, FURRY-BEAR VISITOR, AND YOU OPEN THE DOOR AND YOU'RE FACE TO FACE, YOU'RE IN TROUBLE. A BEAR HAD COME UP, AND HIS HEAD'S ABOUT THAT BIG AROUND. AND LUCKILY, I HAD A .44 MODEL 29, AND HE MET HIS MAKER. ONCE A MONTH, NANCY LEAVES JIM TO FLAG DOWN THE PASSENGER TRAIN TO TAKE HER NORTH TO TALKEETNA, WHERE THEY KEEP THEIR CAR, SO SHE CAN STOCK UP ON SUPPLIES. WELL, I MIGHT NEED THIS LITTLE PIECE OF PAPER. UPHOLSTERY CLEANER. I GOT TO GET THAT DIESEL SMELL OFF OF THAT LA-Z-BOY. I REALLY HATE THE SMELL OF UPHOLSTERY CLEANER, BUT WHATEVER. YOU WANT TO DOUBLE, DOUBLE CHECK TO SEE IF THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE? I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE. HAVE YOU GOT TRAIN TICKETS? YES. SHOPPING LIST? YES. GUN? YES. I LOOK FORWARD TO GETTING ALL MY SUPPLIES IN. IT'S QUITE A CHORE, BUT IT'S REALLY PLEASANT ONCE I GET BACK HOME I FEEL LIKE I HAVE A THREE, FOUR-WEEK VACATION BEFORE I HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THIS AGAIN. EIGHTEEN MILES DOWN THE TRACK, SHANDI IS STILL BATTLING TO CATCH THE PASSENGER TRAIN WITH HER BABY GIRL. IF HUGH CAN'T CLEAR THE TRACK IN TIME, HE'LL HAVE TO STOP IT. AND NEITHER SHE, NOR NANCY, WILL MAKE IT TO TALKEETNA. AT HUGH'S BASE IN TALKEETNA, TODD ROBBINS AND WALT HAND ARE LOADING UP AN EXCAVATOR TO HEAD SOUTH TO DIG OUT THE ICE THAT IS BUILDING UP TOO CLOSE TO THE TRACKS. THIS HERE'S AN EXCAVATOR. IT WEIGHS 44,150 POUNDS. THAT AIN'T INCLUDING MY FAT ASS. THERE WE GO. YOU GOT HER, BUDDY. TAKES A CERTAIN CALIBER TO DO THIS KIND OF JOB, YOU KNOW? IT'S LIKE THE TRUE SEAL TEAM TASK FORCE UP HERE. PUNCH IT OUT, AND GET THEM THROUGH. IT'S PROBABLY ABOUT 30 BELOW. AT LEAST IT'S WARM, AND NOT WINDY. ROBBINS TO WALT HAND. OVER. WALTER HERE, AT CHANNEL FIVE. OVER. GET UP HERE. I'LL SEE YOU ON THE SITE, AND THEN WE'LL BRIEF. OVER. WE GOT A CREW COMING UP RIGHT NOW. WE GOT A POTENTIAL FOR A DERAILMENT RIGHT HERE. WE JUST NEED TO GET IT DONE. SOUTH OF ANCHORAGE... ...HAULING A NEAR RECORD WEIGHT OF OVER 6,500 TONS, DANNY AND ANIMAL'S FREIGHT TRAIN IS STRUGGLING TO THE SUMMIT OF THE KENAI MOUNTAINS. TOP THE HILL HERE, BIG HEAVY PULL, GOT DOWN TO ABOUT 15 MILES AN HOUR. NOW THEY FACE THE MOST DANGEROUS STRETCH OF TRACKS IN AMERICA. THIS ICY, EIGHT-MILE SECTION IS THE STEEPEST DESCENT ON THE ALASKA RAILROAD AND HAS MANY SHARP TURNS. ALL FOUR LOCOMOTIVE ENGINES ARE NEEDED TO CONTROL THE ENORMOUS WEIGHT OF THE BUILDING SUPPLIES PUSHING THEM DOWN THE MOUNTAIN. THEY WILL NEED ALL OF THEIR SKILL TO MAKE IT THROUGH SAFELY. WE'RE UP OVER THE TOP, GOING DOWN A 3% GRADE. HANG ON, HANG ON, HANG ON. WHAT THE **** WAS THAT? WE JUST WENT EMERGENCY. **** HOLY **** COW. GENERAL STOP. THE FREIGHT TRAIN HAS GROUND TO A HALT ON A STEEP DESCENT. IT'S A DESIRED RELEASE. WE MIGHT HAVE SOME ISSUES. THE AIR BRAKES ON ONE OF THE 76 RAIL CARS HAVE LEAKED AIR AND LOST PRESSURE. THE TRAIN'S EMERGENCY BRAKES HAVE KICKED IN, BRINGING THE ENTIRE TRAIN TO A HALT. WE STOPPED HERE AT APPROXIMATELY 47, WEIRDNESS. I'VE NEVER SEEN THIS BEFORE. THERE'S SOME KIND OF AN AIR PROBLEM SOMEWHERE. WE GOT TO FIND IT. SHANDI McEWEN IS ON HER WAY TO THE RAILROAD TRACK TO CATCH THE PASSENGER TRAIN TO THE NEAREST TOWN, TALKEETNA, 30 MILES AWAY. HOPEFULLY WE DIDN'T MISS THE TRAIN. WE'LL JUST WAIT. HER FRIEND AMANDA, WHO IS DUE TO GIVE BIRTH IN JUST TWO WEEKS, ANXIOUSLY AWAITS HER RETURN. USUALLY, I'M NOT TOO NERVOUS ABOUT BEING OUT HERE. BUT WITH NOBODY OUT HERE, AND BEING THIS PREGNANT, IT MAKES ME A LITTLE NERVOUS. I HEARD IT. I HEARD THE TRAIN. THANK GOD, WE DIDN'T MISS IT. THE ALASKA RAILROAD IS UNIQUE. OFF-GRIDDERS CAN FLAG DOWN AND STOP THE PASSENGER TRAIN SERVICE ANYWHERE IN THE WOODS. WE MADE IT. THANK YOU. WE'LL GO AND GET YOU SOME FORMULA AND COME BACK TO AMANDA. DANNY AND ANIMAL'S FREIGHT TRAIN IS STILL STRANDED 30 MILES FROM THE NEAREST TOWN. THEY MUST WORK FAST TO FIND AND FIX THE LEAKING AIR BRAKE TO GET MOVING AGAIN BEFORE IT GETS DARK AND THE TEMPERATURE PLUMMETS. EVERYTHING WAS GOING GREAT, THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, POOF. YOU KNOW, IT JUST WENT TO HELL ON US. WE GOT TO DEFINITELY FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON HERE. AIN'T LIKING THE LOOKS OF THAT. **** EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT, DANO? WHAT WE GOT? WHAT WE GOT? THE CONNECTION IN THE AIR BRAKE SYSTEM PULLED APART. HOW THE HELL DID THAT HAPPEN? THIS BROKE OFF. YOU SEE HOW LOW THESE HANG, ANYWAY. YOU GET HER, DANO? THAT'S SWEET. WE'RE GONNA GO AGAIN AND GIVE ANOTHER ATTEMPT HERE. WITH THE LEAKING AIR BRAKE SEALED BACK UP, BILL CAN RELEASE THE BRAKES AND START THE DESCENT. LET'S ROLL. WE'RE ON THE MOVE, ONCE AGAIN. BACK OFF GRID, JIM AND NANCY ARE ARRIVING AT THE RAILROAD. THE HURRICANE TURN PASSENGER TRAIN ONLY PASSES THROUGH HERE ONCE A MONTH, SO NANCY DOESN'T WANT TO MISS IT. IF WE FORGET SOMETHING, WE'RE WITHOUT FOR A MONTH. THAT'S WHY I STOCK UP A LITTLE EXTRA EVERY TIME I GET A CHANCE OR AN EXTRA DOLLAR. OKAY. LET'S UNLOAD AND GET GOING. PLEASE, YOU KNOW I WORRY WHEN YOU'RE IN THE WOODS BY YOURSELF, HONEY. KLUTZY **** THAT I AM. I KNOW. I WORRY ABOUT NANCY. UP HERE IN THE WOODS, I DON'T HAVE MUCH TO WORRY ABOUT, WHETHER IT'S A MOOSE OR AN IDIOT BEAR OR WHATEVER, BUT OUT THERE IN CIVILIZATION, MY GOSH. IF SOMEBODY DOESN'T WORRY, THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH THEM. BUT NANCY WON'T GET TO MAKE HER TRIP AT ALL IF HUGH EVANS AND HIS CREW CAN'T CLEAR AWAY THE ICE THAT IS FORMING TOO CLOSE TO THE TRACK 15 MILES SOUTH. WE GOT A TRAIN COMING BY THIS AREA, SO WE'RE UNDER A LITTLE BIT OF A TIME CRUNCH RIGHT HERE. SO WE NEED TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO MAKE IT SAFE FOR THEM AND DIG IT BACK. ROGER THAT. I REALLY LIKE WORKING WITH TODD. JUST ANOTHER DAY IN PARADISE. WE HUNT AND FISH TOGETHER. YOU KNOW, WE'VE TAKEN TO HANG OUT. ON THE RAILROAD, HE LOOKS OUT FOR ME. WHEN IT COMES TO HUNTING, I MAKE SURE HE DON'T GET LOST AND HE COMES BACK TO CAMP SAFE, SO IT WORKS OUT. THIS IS DANGEROUS FOR TODD, SO WE GOT TO BE REAL CAREFUL HERE. RAINWATER HAS FLOODED DITCHES ALONGSIDE THE TRACKS AND FROZEN SOLID. IF MORE WATER POOLS ON TOP, THE ICE COULD GROW ACROSS THE TRACKS, BLOCKING THEM. TODD NEEDS TO DIG IT OUT FAST. BALANCED PRECARIOUSLY ON THE FLATBED, HE MANEUVERS HIS EXCAVATOR SO HE CAN REACH THE ICE. IF HE EXTENDS THE ARM TOO FAR, THE 22-TON MACHINE WILL TIP OVER. I'VE SEEN AN EXCAVATOR GO OFF THE FLAT BED, AND IT'S NOT A PRETTY PICTURE. YOU LAY ONE OF THESE OVER THE RAILWAY YOU COULD CRUSH AND KILL YOURSELF INSTANTLY. WELL, THIS **** IS HARD. GETTING INTO SOME HARD ICE HERE. MAN, THE ICE IS THE TOUGHEST THAT IT'S EVER BEEN. DOING MY BEST, BUT IT'S A LITTLE EXTREME TODAY. **** GENTLE BROTHER, GENTLE. JUST A LITTLE BIT LESS ON THE JERKING AROUND THERE, PLEASE, OVER. ALWAYS ONE THING, IS ANOTHER. **** BE CAREFUL THERE, TODD. YOU KNOW, THE EXCAVATOR'S SLIDING AROUND A LOT ON THE CAR, SO JUST TAKE LITTLE BITES. WE DON'T NEED TO TAKE BIG BITES TO TRY TO TEAR THE WORLD UP RIGHT HERE. LET ME DO MY JOB. THAT BOY SCARES ME. A LITTLE BIT OF SLICK ON THE DECK, SO I CAN'T... WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA! WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA! **** ICE HAS BUILT UP SO CLOSE TO THE TRACKS THAT IT MUST BE REMOVED BEFORE THE PASSENGER TRAIN CAN PASS. BUT IN THE RUSH TO CLEAR IT AWAY, THE UNSECURED EXCAVATOR IS IN DANGER OF FALLING OFF THE FLATBED. WE'RE MESSING UP HERE A LITTLE BIT. WE'RE SLIDING AROUND. GO AHEAD AND SHUT IT DOWN. WE'LL CROSS-CHAIN IT RIGHT NOW. OKAY. OKAY. HUGH AND HIS CREW NEED TO CHAIN DOWN THE 22-TON MACHINE TO THE FLATBED TO MAKE IT SAFE. WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO HERE, WALT? CROSS-CHAIN IT FROM THAT TRACK, TO THE SAME HOLE. RIGHT. AND THIS TRACK, TO THAT OTHER HOLE. HAND ME THAT ONE. WE GOT A TRAIN THAT'S GONNA BE ON OUR LOCATION HERE IN THE NEXT 45 MINUTES. SO WE NEED TO GET THIS TAKEN CARE OF AND DIG THIS ICE OUT. BOY, THAT WAS JUST THE SCARIEST **** THIS THING ALMOST SLIDING OFF ON THE EDGE LIKE THAT. YUP, BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL. WELL, HOPEFULLY, THAT WILL DO HER, WALT. IT LOOKS PRETTY GOOD. OKAY. WE'LL GIVE THAT A TRY. HUGH'S ON MY CASE A LITTLE MORE THAN NORMAL TODAY, YOU KNOW. HE'S ALL WORRIED, YOU KNOW... WELL, LOOKING OUT FOR ME. BE CAREFUL THERE, TODD. OVER. Yeah, Hugh. OKAY. YEAH, I JUST DON'T NEED TO HAVE ANY MORE ACCIDENTS THERE, PLEASE, OVER. Roger that, Hugh. YEAH, THAT DEFINITELY LOOKS BETTER THERE, TODD. APPRECIATE. OVER. Yeah, it feels a lot better. TODD NEEDS TO CLEAR MORE THAN 200 TONS OF ICE BEFORE THE PASSENGER TRAIN CAN PASS THROUGH HERE. OVER A WINTER SEASON, RAIL CREWS CAN REMOVE UP TO 200,000 TONS OF ICE TO KEEP TRAINS ROLLING IN ALASKA. WE'RE IN A REAL RACE AGAINST TIME RIGHT NOW, SO WE GOT TO PICK IT UP HERE A LITTLE BIT. HOW IS IT LOOKING THERE, TODD? OVER. LOOKING PRETTY GOOD. APPRECIATE THE HELP THERE. OVER. YOU GOT IT, HUGH. GOOD TO HAVE A GOOD ROADMASTER LOOKING AFTER US. ALL RIGHT, TODD. LET'S CALL IT QUITS RIGHT THERE, OVER. SOUNDS GOOD TO ME. I'M ON IT. HAD MOTHER NATURE THROW US OUR CURVE BALL THIS MORNING WITH THE ICE COMING DOWN TO THE TRACK. WE CAME OUT HERE AND TOOK CARE OF THE PROBLEM. IT SHOULD BE ON TIME FOR OUR TRAIN TO GET THROUGH HERE. GOOD JOB. YOU BET. EVERY DAY IS A CHALLENGE. I FEEL GREAT, YOU KNOW. WE'VE GOT A MOUNTAIN OF ICE MOVED. WE GOT THE TRAINS ABLE TO COME THROUGH NOW, AND EVERYTHING, AND LIFE IS GONNA BE GOOD. IT'S COMING. WITH THE ICE CLEARED, THE PASSENGER TRAIN CAN PASS THROUGH TO PICK UP NANCY. I THINK I HEAR SOMETHING, JIM. THERE IT IS. 4319. TWO COACHES. I'M GOOD. HOW ARE YOU DOING? ALL RIGHT. NOW, YOU JUST STAY OUT OF TROUBLE. HELL, YES. I CAN SURE GET INTO A LOT OF TROUBLE UP HERE BY MYSELF. WHAT'S IT LIKE BEING A NEW MAMA? IT'S NICE. I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL AMANDA HAS HER LITTLE BABY. I'M SUPER EXCITED. YEAH, IT WON'T BE TOO MUCH LONGER. YOU'LL GET TO MAKE SURE AMANDA'S OKAY. YEAH. I'M SURE SHE WILL BE, AND I FINALLY GET TO LOOK AT HER. IN THE SOUTH, DANNY AND ANIMAL ARE HEADING DOWNHILL THROUGH A SECTION OF TRACK KNOWN AS "THE LOOP." IT WAS BUILT IN 1951 TO BYPASS TWO HUGE GLACIERS AND COST $1 MILLION. THIS IS KIND OF NICE. I'M GETTING A REAL GOOD VIEW OF MY TRAIN RIGHT NOW. AND IF IT TURNED OUT IT SHIFTED OR WEIRD... SOMETIMES YOU GO IN A UNDESIRED EMERGENCY, YOU GET A LITTLE BIT OF SLACK, AND IT COULD SHIFT THE LOAD, SO THAT'S WHAT I'M REALLY LOOKING AT. IT'S 2:00 P.M. ENGINEER BILL BIVINS IS TRYING TO MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME AND GET TO ANCHORAGE BEFORE IT'S DARK. Six, two, one, nine, you have a stop. **** WELL, THIS TRAIN IS BEING A PAIN IN THE ASS TODAY. WE'RE JUST GETTING HAMMERED BY ALL KIND OF THINGS. SO NOW WE'VE GOT TO STOP THE TRAIN AGAIN AND GO CHECK IT OUT. COMING TO A STOP. IT'S 2:15 P.M. NANCY AND SHANDI ARE ARRIVING AT TALKEETNA. ALL TALKEETNA PASSENGERS, WE WILL BE UNLOADING THE TRAIN FROM THE "C" CAR. THIS SMALL TOWN IS THE NEAREST STOP FOR OFF-GRIDDERS TO STOCK UP ON VITAL SUPPLIES. IT'S ALSO A BASE CAMP FOR CLIMBERS ATTEMPTING NORTH AMERICA'S TALLEST PEAK, MT. McKINLEY. I HAVE ONE MORE, JACK. BYE, EVERYONE. NANCY FACES HER OWN UPHILL STRUGGLE. SHE'S 25 MILES AWAY FROM THE GROCERY STORE. SHE OWNS A CAR, BUT IT'S NOT BEEN STARTED FOR A MONTH AND IS BURIED UNDER SNOW. THIS IS MY PARKING SPOT. WE ALWAYS HAVE TO SHOVEL OUR CAR OUT WHEN WE GET TO TOWN. THIS IS ONE WAY TO GET EXERCISE. THIS ROAD IS VERY IMPORTANT. WE COULDN'T SURVIVE WITHOUT IT. IT'S ALWAYS A PLEASURE TO GET OUR FRESH, COLORFUL VEGGIES HOME. NAGLEY'S, THE LOCAL STORE, HAS BEEN IN TALKEETNA FOR ALMOST A CENTURY. HI, CHRIS. I'M JUST GONNA GET FORMULA AND GET BACK TO AMANDA BEFORE ANYTHING HAPPENS. THAT'S IT. HOW'S AMANDA DOING? SHE'S DOING GOOD. HOW ARE THINGS WITH YOU? PRETTY GOOD. WAITING FOR SPRING. I KNOW. I CAN'T WAIT. I'M GONNA TRY AND DO A GARDEN THIS YEAR. THE ONLY THING YOU CAN GROW IN TALKEETNA, IS GOLD. BYE. GOT TO GET BACK TO AMANDA. I SHOULDN'T HAVE LEFT HER OUT THERE FOR SO LONG. I HOPE NOTHING BAD HAS HAPPENED. I FEEL GUILTY SOMETIMES LEAVING JIM, BUT I DO WORRY ABOUT HIM, YOU KNOW. WE'RE HARDLY EVER APART. I LOOK FORWARD TO THESE TRIPS, THOUGH. I KIND OF NEED TO SOCIALIZE WITH SOMEBODY OTHER THAN JIM. BUT I'M ALWAYS FEARFUL THAT HE MIGHT HURT HIMSELF IN SOME WAY OR THE OTHER. WELL, WHEN NANCY'S NOT AROUND, I TRY TO KEEP AHEAD OF THE FIRE SITUATION. IT'S ENOUGH TO KEEP YOU GOING ALL THE TIME. AS YOU CAN SEE, IT'S HARD WORK FOR AN OLD MAN, BUT THE HARDEST THING IS LOADING THEM. WHEN YOU GOT TWO HANDS, IT'S NOT SO BAD, SO I'VE DESIGNED ANOTHER WAY. I SCREWED UP MY DAMN KNEE. I'M OLD. **** WORE OUT. I DIDN'T THINK I WAS GONNA LIVE THIS LONG. I FIGURED 21, 22 YEARS. THAT WAS IT. I SURPRISED MYSELF AND A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE, TOO. A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE WISHING I'D HURRY UP AND DIE. NOW, THEY SAY, "YOU RUST OUT BEFORE YOU WEAR OUT." AW **** I HURT LIKE HELL. FEEL LIKE I BEEN KICKED BY MULE. HI, NANCY. HI. WHEN DID YOU GET HERE? I'M GONNA GET BY YOU. WELL, AS YOU CAN SEE, I'VE BEEN HERE FOR A WHILE. HOW IS JIM? YOU KNOW, HE'S A LITTLE STRESSED BECAUSE I'M HERE. RIGHT. WELL, GIVE HIM MY LOVE. I WILL, I WILL. OKAY. AND I'M SURE HE'S... HE RETURNS HIS LOVE TO YOU. OF COURSE, BECAUSE HE LOVES ME. WELL, YOU'RE MY FAVORITE. IT'S VERY BAD IF I COME TO THE GROCERY STORE WHEN I'M HUNGRY. I TEND TO BUY SO MUCH MORE THAN WHAT IS REALLY NEEDED. MUST HAVE SUGAR. YOU DON'T NEED TO GO THROUGH LIFE SO RIGID, SOMETIMES. WE LIKE OUR TREATS, ALSO. RON, COULD I HAVE YOU UP FRONT FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE, PLEASE. I VERY MUCH LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING NANCY ONCE A MONTH. ONCE YOU LIVE THAT LIFESTYLE, OUT IN NATURE AND BEING VERY QUIET ALL THE TIME, IT'S MILDLY TRAUMATIC TO COME BACK INTO THE HUSTLE AND BUSTLE. EVEN COMING TO TALKEETNA, IT'S IMPACTING. $560.57. OKAY. THANKS FOR COMING IN. SEE YOU NEXT MONTH. ALL RIGHTY. ANIMAL AND DANNY'S FREIGHT TRAIN HAS COME TO A HALT AT THE BOTTOM OF THE KENAI MOUNTAINS. ONE OF THE BRAKES HAS OVERHEATED. HOT WHEEL GOT US. WE'RE STOPPED. WE'RE GONNA INSPECT AND FIX, AND I WILL LET YOU KNOW WHEN WE'RE OUT OF HERE. ONE BRAKE LOCKED ON SO HARD DURING THE DESCENT THAT THE WHEEL HAS OVERHEATED. HERE WE GO. BUSY WE BEGIN. WELL, WE GOT HEAT HERE, JACK. YEAH. HOLY **** LISTEN TO THAT. THOSE WHEELS ARE WAY TOO HOT TO FOOL WITH. I BET I COULD FRY A EGG ON THAT RIGHT NOW. THEM BRAKE SHOES ARE HOTTER THAN HELL. THEY NEED TO LOOSEN THE BRAKE PADS AND ALLOW THE WHEEL TO COOL DOWN BEFORE THEY CAN GET MOVING AGAIN. RAILROAD WORKERS HERE HAVE BEEN BATTLING THIS PROBLEM FOR ALMOST 100 YEARS, AND THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO COOL THE WHEELS DOWN. THESE THINGS STICK ONCE IN A WHILE. I AIN'T GONNA GET THAT. YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO TO THE OTHER SIDE, DANO. IT'S WHACKED **** I'M JUST HITTING IT WITH THE **** MALLET. LIKE, DANO? CRACK IT AND SEE. ANY BETTER? I THINK IT IS. GOOD TO GO. IT'S GONNA BE TIGHT GETTING TO ANCHORAGE NOW. WE'RE A LITTLE UNDER THE GUN. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO GETTING THIS THING THERE AND BEING DONE WITH IT. WE'VE BEEN FIGHTING THE DILEMMAS ALL DAY LONG, BUT WHAT THAT WAS, WE GOT BY LUCKY THERE. BACK AT TALKEETNA TRAIN STATION, ITS 3:00 P.M. AND 20 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT. WELL, NOW THAT I GOT WHAT I NEED, I'M JUST WAITING FOR THIS TRAIN TO GET HERE. I REALLY WANT TO GET TO BACK TO AMANDA. GETTING A LITTLE NERVOUS. HOPE SHE'S OKAY. HEY, NANCY. HEY, JACK. ARE YOU READY FOR THIS? ALL THESE EXTRA HANDS REALLY MAKE IT A LOT EASIER. GIVE ME THAT, HIT ME. ALL RIGHT. I THINK THAT'S GOT IT. SO YOU GOT IT? YEAH. GOOD. THE BARS OPEN. I GOT TO GO. THE TRAIN IS COMING. NOW YOU CAN QUIT WORRYING ABOUT AMANDA. I KNOW. THE ALASKA RAILROAD TRAIN IS NEVER LATE, AND TALKEETNA TIME IS NEVER ON TIME, SO WE WORK WELL TOGETHER, ALL OF US. WELL, WE JUST MADE THE TRAIN. HOPEFULLY, I'LL MAKE IT BACK BEFORE IT GETS DARK. WE'RE GOING ACROSS THE BRIDGE, AND WE'RE JUST ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILE OUT. EACH OFF-GRIDDER HAS A SIGN POST BY THE SIDE OF THE TRACK SHOWING WHERE THEY LIVE. CONDUCTOR HARRY ROSS KNOWS THEM ALL AND TELLS THE ENGINEER DRIVING THE TRAIN WHEN TO STOP. HI, HONEY. SEE YOU NEXT TIME. HAVE A GOOD ONE. THANK YOU. ONE HUNDRED MILES SOUTH, DANNY AND ANIMAL ARE APPROACHING ANCHORAGE WITH THEIR FREIGHT LOAD OF TIMBER AFTER AN EVENTFUL JOURNEY FROM THE PORT OF SEWARD. YOU KNOW, WE JUST AIN'T HAD MUCH LUCK TODAY. IT'S PUT US BEHIND, YOU KNOW. SOMETIMES YOU WIN, SOMETIMES YOU LOSE, BUT AT LEAST YOU GET TO PLAY. ALL RIGHT, BROTHER, WE MADE IT. I'M ECSTATIC. IT'S A TAD LATE, AND IT'S BEEN QUITE A LITTLE ADVENTURE. BUILDING SUPPLY MERCHANT, KEVIN STARNES, HAS COME TO PICK UP HIS ORDER THAT'S WORTH OVER $5 MILLION. ANIMAL, DANNY, HOW'S IT GOING? GOOD. HOW YOU DOING, KEVIN? GOOD, GOOD, GOOD. GOOD TO SEE YOU. YOU GUYS HAVE A GOOD TRIP? NO AVALANCHES, A LITTLE TRAIN TROUBLE UP ON THE TOP, A LITTLE BIT SPOOKY BUT... YOU KNOW. I GOT SOME HOT SHEET ROCK ON THERE FOR A CUSTOMER UP ON BASE, AND THEY'VE BEEN SCREAMING AT ME FOR ABOUT A WEEK NOW, SO I'M GLAD YOU GUYS HAVE GOT HERE. WELL, I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU GOT A SMILE ON YOUR FACE WHEN WE GOT IT HERE. YUP, THAT'S WHAT COUNTS. THAT'S THE MAIN THING. GOOD TO SEE YOU GUYS. GOOD TO SEE YOU. YEAH, I'LL BET. ALL RIGHT. THE TERRAIN IS TREACHEROUS, THE WORK IS DANGEROUS, AND WE JUST DO THE BEST WE CAN WITH WHAT WE GOT. BACK OFF GRID, THE LIGHT IS FADING FAST. SHANDI IS CARRYING HER EIGHT-POUND BABY DAUGHTER, KEROINE, AND IS EAGER TO GET BACK TO AMANDA'S CABIN BEFORE NIGHTFALL. TRAIN'S GONE. IT'S ABOUT ANOTHER TWO MILES TO THE CABIN. STILL GOT A LONG WAY TO GO. I WISH I HAD BROUGHT MY SNOWSHOES 'CAUSE THIS WOULD BE WAY EASIER. IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO WALK WITHOUT SNOWSHOES ON A TRAIL THAT HASN'T TOTALLY BEEN PACKED DOWN. NANCY AND JIM ARE ALREADY AT HOME ENJOYING COOKING VEGETABLES WITH JIM'S FAVORITE CAJUN SPICE. YOU CAN TAKE A NASTY ASS BEAR AND COOK HIM UP WITH THIS MIX, AND HE'S GOOD. WOW. AND THE CARROTS PUT NICE COLOR TO IT. WELL, HOW IS IT? DAMN GOOD. WARMING YOUR BELLY UP AFTER SUCH A TOUGH DAY. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE UGLIER THE ANIMAL, THE BETTER THEY TASTE. I DON'T HAVE ANY DESSERT TO FEED YOU. YOU DON'T HAVE ANY BROWNIES, THE LITTLE BROWNIES? WELL, THOSE IN THE BOX IN THERE. YOU WANT ONE OF THEM? SURE, I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THEM. BUT SOME PEOPLE ARE MORE TROUBLE THAN THEY'RE WORTH, AND I'M JUST GLAD YOU'RE WORTH SOMETHING, SO YOU'RE NOT SO MUCH TROUBLE. WELL, THANK YOU. AMANDA? IS EVERYTHING OKAY? AMANDA? HEY. HI! I'M STILL PREGNANT. YEAH. COME IN AND DRY OFF. HOW HAVE YOU BEEN? GOOD. IT'S BEEN GOOD. YEAH? YEAH. EVERYTHING WENT FINE? YEAH. I'M GLAD YOU'RE BACK, BUT IT'S GOOD. I'M GLAD WE DID NOT HAVE A BABY WHILE YOU WERE GONE. YOU KNOW, I WAS, LIKE, WORRIED THE WHOLE ENTIRE TIME. AND I SAW NANCY, AND I WAS, LIKE, "I'M SUPER WORRIED." AND SHE'S JUST, LIKE, "I'M SURE EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE." EVERY LITTLE MOVEMENT, I WOULD THINK... I WAS, LIKE, "NO, NO, YOU CAN'T COME YET." I'M SO HAPPY THAT I GOT TO GET FORMULA FOR HER AND COME BACK, ALL IN ONE PIECE. SO GLAD SHE MADE IT BACK, AND EVERYTHING WORKED OUT. THERE WAS A COUPLE MOMENTS. IT WAS LIKE I REALLY DON'T WANT TO HAVE A BABY UP HERE BY MYSELF. CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS
