 ...RISK SHUTTING DOWN ALASKA'S LIFELINE. I HOPE TO HELL THEY GET DOWN HERE, 'CAUSE I'M FREEZING TO DEATH. THE PORT OF WHITTIER. IT'S 9:00 A.M. A BARGE CARRYING RAILCARS LOADED WITH $30 MILLION WORTH OF FREIGHT IS DOCKING. RAIL CREW DANNY AND "ANIMAL" ARE EAGER TO GET THE FREIGHT CARS OFF THE BARGE SO THEY CAN BUILD THEIR TRAIN. ALL RIGHT, GUYS, IT'S 34 DEGREES OUT. THEY GOT FOUR TO SIX INCHES ACCUMULATION FORECAST, BUT I THINK WE'RE GONNA GET MORE THAN THAT. JUST WATCH YOUR FOOTING OUT THERE. YEAH, AND THE WEATHER'S JUST GONNA PROGRESSIVELY GET WORSE. IT'S LOOKING LIKE IT'S STARTING TO COME DOWN PRETTY GOOD NOW. IT'S GONNA SWITCH AROUND AND BLOW WESTERLY. PROBABLY HAVE A NEAR BLIZZARD... AGAIN. EXACTLY. YES. HAVE THEY RELEASED THE BARGE TO US? YES, SO WE'RE READY TO GO. I'M READY. HERE WE GO. LET'S GO. ALL RIGHT. GO! BEAUTIFUL DAY IN WHITTIER. IT'S SO **** IN WHITTIER THAT EVEN THE RAVENS ARE LEAVING. YEAH, MAN, I'M ITCHING TO GET ON THAT **** BARGE SO I CAN ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING. DANNY AND ANIMAL MUST QUICKLY ASSEMBLE A TRAIN FROM THE FREIGHT CARS ON THE BARGE SO IT CAN TRAVEL FROM THE PORT OF WHITTIER THROUGH THE AVALANCHE-PRONE CHUGACH MOUNTAINS TO ANCHORAGE BEFORE BAD WEATHER LOCKS THEM DOWN. THE COMMODITY ON THESE CARS IS HOT, HOT, HOT. I MEAN, THESE PEOPLE WANT THEIR PRODUCT NOW, NOW, NOW. THE ALASKA RAILROAD SHIPS MORE THAN 5 MILLION TONS OF FREIGHT ACROSS THE STATE EACH YEAR. IT WAS BUILT TO SHUTTLE CRUCIAL SUPPLIES, INCLUDING COAL, CHEMICALS, AND CONSTRUCTION GEAR, TO AREAS IMPOSSIBLE TO REACH BY SEA, AIR, OR ROAD DURING THE EXTREME WINTERS. THESE DUMP TRUCKS, THESE ARE A HOT LOAD GOING TO THE MUNICIPALITY OF ANCHORAGE FOR SNOW REMOVAL. THEY SAY SNOW REMOVAL, BUT YOU DON'T NEVER REMOVE IT. YOU JUST PUT IT SOMEPLACE ELSE TILL IT MELTS. TIME IS MONEY. MONEY IS TIME. WE DON'T TURN RAIL CARS, THE WHEELS AREN'T ROLLING, WE'RE NOT MAKING ANY MONEY. BETWEEN ANIMAL AND MYSELF, THIS IS PROBABLY THOUSANDTH OR MORE BARGE THAT WE'VE WORKED. BUT I'M 60 YEARS OLD. IF I CAN KEEP MY HEALTH, I'LL WORK HERE TILL I'M 70. WE'RE READY. ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO. 3009, LET'S BRING THEM ON BACK. HERE WE COME, "DANNO." AND I'M READY, ANIMAL. ONE ON THE STERN. OKAY, DANNO, ONE ON THE STERN. THANK YOU. OVER. HOT RAIL. 20 FEET. DANNY AND ANIMAL WORK AS A TEAM FROM OPPOSITE ENDS OF THE BARGE. FIVE FEET. DANNY RELEASES ALL THE HAND BRAKES ON THE FREIGHTS CARS. ANIMAL HOOKS UP THE LOCOMOTIVE TO THOSE CARS SO THEY CAN BE PULLED OFF THE BARGE ONTO THE MAIN LAND TRACK. 3009, STOP. EACH FULLY-LOADED CAR WEIGHS MORE THAN 100 TONS. CLEAR AND READY UP HERE, DAN. OVER. Thank you, 3009. WHEN YOU ARE READY, START THEM AHEAD, GENTLY AT FIRST. All right. Easy. HERE WE GO. GOT THEM ALL MOVING. EVERYTHING OUT HERE IS DESIGNED TO BITE YOU ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. IF YOU'RE NOT PAYING ATTENTION, YOU CAN GET CRUSHED. WE HAD SOMEBODY, HE GOT IN THE WRONG SPOT AT THE WRONG TIME, AND HE DID GET ROLLED BETWEEN THE CARS JUST LIKE A HOT DOG, YOU KNOW, AND HE SURVIVED IT, BUT, YOU KNOW, IT SURE MESSED HIM UP FOR A FEW YEARS. 3009 OFF THE BARGE. ALL RIGHT! FIRST RAIL PULLED. GOOD JOB. 200 MILES NORTH OF THE PORT OF WHITTIER... CUT OFF FROM THE REST OF SOCIETY IN A REMOTE CABIN, 66-YEAR-OLD JIM JAMES AND HIS 60-YEAR-OLD WIFE, NANCY, LIVE IN THE WOODS. THEIR NEAREST TOWN IS TALKEETNA, 14 MILES AWAY. THEY'RE TOTALLY DEPENDENT ON THE RAILROAD. FOR THEM, IT CAN MAKE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH. WE'VE BEEN OUT HERE SINCE 1995, ENJOYING THE BUSH LIFE. YOU SURE GIVE ME AN EASY JOB WHEN IT COMES TO GETTING WATER. I JUST STAND HERE AND WATCH YOU WORK. ISN'T THAT NICE? IT IS VERY NICE. THE REASON THAT I MOVED UP HERE IS BECAUSE I LOVE THE OUTDOORS AND I HATE SOCIETY. OUT HERE IN THE WOODS, I AM KING OF MY DOMAIN, SO TO SPEAK. WE LIVE OFF-GRID, ROUGHLY 13 MILES NORTH OF THE NEAREST ROAD. THE ONLY WAY I CAN REALLY GET TO TOWN IS VIA THE ALASKA RAILROAD. HE DOESN'T LIKE TO GO TO TOWN, AND TOWN DOESN'T NECESSARILY LIKE FOR HIM TO COME. RIGHT. I TEND TO **** UP WHEN I GO TO TOWN, YES. I LET MY ALLIGATOR MOUTH OVERLOAD MY CANARY BUTT, AND I DON'T TAKE ANY **** WITH JIM, HE'S KIND OF LIKE A BULL IN A CHINA SHOP. SOMETIMES, HE GETS HURT. ABOUT 3 1/2 YEARS AGO, HE ACCIDENTALLY LOST HIS HAND. WELL, I WAS TAKING A SHOTGUN OFF THE FRONT OF A FOUR-WHEELER. IT WAS LOADED, AND WHEN I GRABBED AHOLD OF THE END OF THE BARREL, I PULLED IT TOWARD ME, AND EVIDENTLY, IT KNOCKED THE SAFETY OFF, AND IT BLEW MY HAND OFF. GIVE ME A HAND WITH THIS, HONEY. GET THAT SHOULDER. I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T SEE THAT. THANK YOU. YOU CAN'T FIX STUPID, AND I'M PRETTY DAMN LUCKY. HELL, THERE'S PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT AIN'T GOT NO ARMS, SO CAN'T BITCH. THERE IS A CERTAIN SATISFACTION ABOUT BEING ABLE TO SUBSIST OUT HERE ON OUR OWN, BUT IF SOMETHING DRAMATIC HAPPENS, IT'S LIFE-THREATENING. WE CAN'T JUST GO NEXT DOOR, IN OTHER WORDS, AND GET HELP. YOU JUST HAVE TO BE TOTALLY AWARE THAT YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON YOU CAN DEPEND ON UP HERE... YOU AND YOUR SPOUSE. WE GOT TO GET THIS STUFF IN. I SMELL PROPANE. WHAT'D YOU SAY? I SMELL PROPANE. THAT ONE'S EMPTY. WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT. WELL, I KNOW. WE DAMN SURE DON'T NEED TO RUN OUT OF PROPANE NOW. WHY DON'T YOU GO AHEAD AND GET IN AND CALL THE RAILROAD? SOMETIMES, WE HAVE TO WAIT A FEW WEEKS BEFORE THE TUNDRA TRUCK CAN ARRANGE TO DELIVER OUR PROPANE. IT'S GETTING LIFE-THREATENING FOR US. THE RAILROAD DELIVERS SUPPLIES ON A SPECIALLY ADAPTED TRUCK THAT RUNS ON RAILS. THE TUNDRA TRUCK CARRIES FUELS AND OTHER LOADS THAT CAN'T GO BY PASSENGER TRAIN. WE'RE OUT OF PROPANE UP HERE, AND THINGS ARE STARTING TO GET TENSE. I HOPE WHEN HE COMES BACK, HE HAS GOOD NEWS. WHEN DO YOU GOT A TUNDRA TRUCK COMING THIS WAY? TODAY, YEAH? WELL, HELL, I'LL HAVE THEM BOTTLES LOADED UP AND TAKE THEM DOWN TO THE TRAILHEAD. BYE-BYE. YEAH, WE GOT TO GET THE HELL GOING AND GET THESE TANKS DOWN THERE SO THE TUNDRA TRUCK CAN PICK THEM UP. THANK GOD FOR THE ALASKA RAILROAD. JIM AND NANCY NEED TO LOAD UP THEIR EMPTY PROPANE TANKS AND GET TO THE RAILROAD FIVE MILES AWAY. THEY DON'T WANT TO MISS THE TUNDRA TRUCK. IT'S ABOUT 20 BELOW, SOMETHING LIKE THAT. EVERYTHING FREEZES. OUCH! YOU **** **** NANCY, GIVE ME HAND HERE, WILL YOU? YEAH, I'M COMING. LET'S GET THIS SON OF A **** LOADED. DO YOU HAVE ANOTHER ONE TO GO IN? YEAH, WE GOT A COUPLE MORE TO GO. **** WHAT NOW? I DON'T KNOW. IT'S PROBABLY A **** SPARK PLUG. IF ANYTHING ELSE COULD GO WRONG, IT **** WOULD GO WRONG. DEEP IN THE ALASKAN WILDERNESS, OFF-GRIDDERS JIM AND NANCY JAMES ARE STRUGGLING TO GET THEIR SNOWMOBILE STARTED. THEY NEED TO MEET THE RAILROAD'S TUNDRA TRUCK TO GET MORE PROPANE. HOPEFULLY THIS **** IS GONNA START AND GET THE HELL GOING. YAY! I DON'T THINK WE MADE IT. IT'S COMING FROM THE NORTH? RIGHT. THE ONLY THING WE CAN DO IS JUST SIT HERE AND WAIT, AND I HOPE TO HELL THEY GET DOWN HERE, 'CAUSE I'M FREEZING TO DEATH. 30 MILES AWAY, RAILROAD BOSS HUGH EVANS IS ON HIS DAILY MISSION TO INSPECT THE TRACK. THE ICE AND SNOW IN ALASKA WREAKS HAVOC WITH THE RAILS, CAUSING THE STEEL TO BUCKLE AND CRACK, INCREASING THE ODDS OF A DERAILMENT. THE TUNDRA TRUCK WON'T BE ALLOWED TO PASS THROUGH HIS SECTION UNTIL HE'S SURE IT'S SAFE. I GOT 135 MILES OF TRACK TO MAINTAIN OUT HERE. THE RAILROAD'S A GOOD PLACE TO WORK, YOU KNOW? A LOT OF GOOD PEOPLE I'VE WORKED WITH OUT HERE. YEAH, THEY'RE LIKE MY FAMILY. CAL'S UP AHEAD, PLOWING THE SNOW OFF SO THAT WE CAN DO A VISUAL INSPECTION OF OUR TRACK, AND I'M LOOKING TO MAKE SURE THERE'S NO DEFECTS, BROKEN RAILS, ANY OTHER CONDITION THAT MIGHT CAUSE A PROBLEM. WHOA. DR24 TO 1237 CHANNEL 5. OVER. 1237. OVER. Yeah, I ran over something. IT MADE A GOOD CLUNK. I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S A CRUSHED HEAD OR A BROKEN RAIL, BUT I'M GONNA STOP UP HERE AND CHECK IT OUT IF YOU WANT TO EASE UP TO ME. OVER. **** WE'LL FIND OUT WHAT WE GOT UP HERE. TAKE A LOOK AT IT. ANOTHER DAY IN THE TROPICS. YEAH, WELL, WE GOT A CRACK. **** WE NEED TO CUT IT OUT, ROLL THIS PIECE OUT, PUT THE NEW PIECE IN, SPIKE IT DOWN, AND HOPEFULLY WE'RE DONE BEFORE THAT TUNDRA TRUCK GETS HERE. I NEED TO GO CALL MIKE AND SEE IF THEY GOT THAT BOOM TRUCK GOING. WE NEED THAT THING TODAY. BACK AT BASE IN TALKEETNA, BROTHERS MIKE AND ANTHONY HOADLEY ARE TRYING TO FIX HUGH'S BROKEN-DOWN BOOM TRUCK. HE WON'T BE ABLE TO REPAIR THE TRACK WITHOUT IT. IT HAS A BOOM ON IT SO HE CAN LIFT HEAVY STUFF... YOU KNOW, CHANGE RAIL AND PICK UP THE BIG STUFF THAT THE SMALLER TRUCKS CAN'T GET. WITHOUT IT THE TRAINS STOP, BASICALLY, SO... THESE FILTERS ARE FINE. THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THEM. SO WE'LL HAVE TO TRY SOMETHING ELSE. HUGH EVANS TO MIKE HOADLEY. OVER. YEAH, MIKE, WE JUST FOUND A RAIL THAT'S GOT A CRACK IN IT. HOW ARE WE COMING WITH THAT BOOM TRUCK? OVER. **** OKAY. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU. OVER. BASICALLY, WE'VE GOT A REAL PROBLEM HERE. IF WE DON'T GET THAT BOOM TRUCK GOING, THEN WE'RE GONNA HAVE A BROKEN RAIL OUT HERE TONIGHT. IT'S 2:00 NOW. WE'RE GONNA HAVE A TUNDRA TRUCK IN OUR AREA ABOUT 5:00, SO WE NEED TO TAKE AND GET THIS DONE ASAP. THE TUNDRA TRUCK'S AT HURRICANE, TRAVELLING SOUTH TOWARDS HUGH AND ITS FIRST DELIVERY OF THE DAY AT GOLD CREEK... WHERE 42-YEAR-OLD OFF-GRIDDER JOHN WILSON LIVES BY HIMSELF. HOW YOU DOING, PRETTY BIRD? THIS IS THE CABIN I'VE LIVED IN MY WHOLE LIFE, SINCE I WAS 2 YEARS OLD. AND I'VE GOT GOLD CREEK, ALASKA, ON MY BIRTH CERTIFICATE. I'VE ALWAYS LIVED IN THE WOODS. BEING OUT HERE BY MYSELF, IT'S EASY TO LOSE TRACK WHAT DAY IT IS. YOU KNOW, EVERY DAY IS KIND OF THE SAME, AND THEY BLEND TOGETHER, AND I USUALLY KNOW WHAT TIME OF DAY IT IS, BUT NOT NECESSARILY WHAT DAY OF THE MONTH IT IS. WATCHING THE BIRDS IS WHAT I DO EVERY DAY. THEY KEEP ME COMPANY. THEY HAVE THEIR OWN LITTLE SOCIETY GOING ON OUT THERE. THEY'RE ALMOST AN EXTENSION TO THE FAMILY. IT GETS REALLY QUIET, AND CABIN FEVER IS A REAL PHENOMENON. IT CAN GET REALLY BAD. YOU GO A LITTLE NUTS. I'LL BE TALKING TO THE BIRDS. I'LL BE TALKING TO THE, YOU KNOW, THE VOLES AND SHREWS THAT ARE RUNNING AROUND OUT THERE, AND THEN I'LL REALIZE, "YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M TALKING TO MYSELF," AND YOU WOULDN'T DO THAT IN TOWN, YOU KNOW, WHEN THERE'S ACTUAL PEOPLE TO TALK TO. JOHN NEEDS TO MEET THE TUNDRA TRUCK TO COLLECT DIESEL TO RUN HIS SNOW MACHINE AND POWER HIS CABIN. THE RAILROAD IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING OUT HERE. WITHOUT THE RAIL, THERE WOULDN'T BE NO PEOPLE HERE. IN CONVENIENCE STORES IN TOWN, IT'S 24/7, YOU KNOW, AND ANY TIME YOU COULD GO DOWN THERE, YOU JUST GO DOWN THERE, AND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, YOU CAN GET YOUR HOT DOG OR WHATEVER, BUT THIS IS THE STORE. WAITING AT THE TRACKS FOR THE SHIPMENT... THAT'S OUR STORE. I'M GONNA CHECK THE FUSES INSIDE TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY BREAKERS TRIPPED, OKAY? I THINK IT'S JUST THESE FUSES HERE. THIS TRUCK'S GETTING ON IN YEARS. ANYTHING CAN GO WRONG. LET'S CHECK THE FUEL SENSOR. YEAH, I GOT A LOSE WIRE UP HERE. THAT MIGHT BE IT. I GUESS WE'LL GIVE THAT A TRY. HERE GOES. **** ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. WE GOT IT. I THINK WE'RE IN THE CLEAR NOW. EVANS, OVER. OKAY. ALL RIGHT, Y'ALL GAVE ME A SIGH OF RELIEF. WE'LL SEE YOU UP THERE. THANK YOU. OUT. ALL RIGHT. I THINK YOU'RE ON. LET'S GO FIX THE RAILROAD. RAILROAD CREWS HAVE HAD TO REPAIR OR REPLACE UP TO HALF A MILLION FEET OF WORN OR WEATHER-BEATEN TRACK A YEAR TO KEEP THE STATE'S TRAINS ROLLING. HERE COMES THE CAVALRY. WHOO! YEAH, THAT'S A REAL BIG RELIEF, HAVING THE TRUCK RUNNING. WE'RE GONNA TAKE AND GET THIS RAIL PUT IN NOW AND GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE. ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY STAND CLEAR. THE SPARK GETS SO HOT IT'LL BURN RIGHT THROUGH THE LEATHER OF YOUR BOOT, RIGHT DOWN TO THE SKIN. YOU CAN'T GET YOUR BOOT OFF FAST ENOUGH WHEN THAT HAPPENS. WE'RE GONNA TAKE AND USE THE BOOM HERE TO BRING ONE OF THE RAILS DOWN. MEASURE TWICE. CUT ONCE. ROLL OUT THE OLD ONE, AND PUT THE NEW ONE IN PLACE. READY? NOW SWING IT THE OTHER WAY. COMING DOWN. OKAY. ALL RIGHT, ROLLING THE RAIL. IF WE'RE GONNA DELAY THE TUNDRA TRUCK, IT'S NOT GONNA BE ON MY WATCH. IN THE PORT OF WHITTIER, ATROCIOUS WEATHER HAS PUT DANNY AND ANIMAL BEHIND SCHEDULE. THEY'VE PULLED 55 FREIGHT CARS OFF THE BARGE, LINKING THEM TOGETHER TO BUILD ONE LONG TRAIN. THEY'VE GOT 15 MORE TO HAUL OFF AND HOOK UP. WE WATCH OUT FOR EACH OTHER ON THAT BARGE, AND THAT'S WHY WE STAY IN CONSTANT COMMUNICATION. ALL RIGHT, READY FOR A HOOK ON TRACK SIX. HERE WE COME. Thank you. YOU KNOW, WE'RE DEALING WITH BIG, HEAVY EQUIPMENT, SO MY FIRST PRIORITY IS ME. MY SECOND PRIORITY IS HIM. 3009, STOP. 'CAUSE I'M GONNA SLITHER MY WAY DOWN BETWEEN THESE CARS AND KNOCK SOME HAND BRAKES OFF. IT'S WEIRD, BUT I LIKE DOING THAT **** YOU KNOW, I REALLY LIKE TO GO HOME WITH EVERYTHING THAT I CAME WITH. READY HERE, DAN. ALL CLEAR. OVER. Thank you. 3009, WHEN YOU ARE READY, GET STARTED AHEAD, GENTLY AT FIRST. AND YOU GOT THEM ALL MOVING. Moving. AND THERE THEY GO. DANNY AND ANIMAL ARE EAGER TO LEAVE BEFORE THE WEATHER DETERIORATES. DURING THE WORST STORMS, TRAINS CAN BE SNOWED INTO THE PORT FOR DAYS. WE GOT HER DONE, BABY. WHOO-HOO! 30 MILES UP THE TRACK IS A NOTORIOUSLY DANGEROUS AVALANCHE ZONE. DANNY AND ANIMAL'S FREIGHT TRAIN CAN'T GET THROUGH UNTIL THE CREW, LED BY ROADMASTER BRUCE GOUGH, MAKES SURE THE AREA IS SAFE. THIS PAST YEAR, WE DID HAVE A TRAIN THAT GOT HIT BY A FAIRLY LARGE SLIDE AND KNOCKED OFF A FEW OF OUR RAILCARS. IT WAS PRETTY ROUGH ON US. AVALANCHES ARE THE BIGGEST THREAT TO THIS STRETCH OF THE RAIL LINE. A QUARTER OF A MILLION TONS OF SNOW CAN ACCELERATE TO OVER 80 MILES AN HOUR IN JUST 5 SECONDS, BLOCKING THE LINE, WRECKING TRAINS, AND KILLING CREW. BRUCE HAS SENT DAVE SHAFER AHEAD TO CLEAR SNOW FROM THE TRACK AND CHECK THE AVALANCHE DANGER ZONE. WHOA, LOOK AT THAT! **** 25 TO BRUCE GOUGH. OVER. HOW'S IT GOING, DAVE? YEAH, BRUCE, WE'RE ABLE TO GET UP THE HILL. WE'RE DOING PRETTY GOOD, BUT WE DID SEE A NATURAL AVALANCHE HERE AT THE SLIDES. OVER AND OUT. COPY. JUST GOT NEWS FROM DAVE. HE JUST SAW A NATURAL AVALANCHE COME DOWN, AND THAT'S PRETTY CONCERNING. MOTHER NATURE IS NOT GONNA TAKE KINDLY TO YOU IF YOU'RE NOT PREPARED. BACK UP, BROTHER. BECAUSE THE SNOW IS ALREADY FALLING DOWN THE MOUNTAINS, BRUCE'S ONLY OPTION IS TO ACCELERATE THE AVALANCHES SO THEY LAND BEFORE THE TRAIN PASSES. HE SHUTS DOWN THE TRACK AND BRINGS OUT A CANNON. WITH THIS LONG-RANGE 105 HOWITZER, THE TEAM WILL FIRE SHELLS INTO THE DANGER ZONE TO TRIGGER THEIR OWN MAN-MADE SNOW SLIDE. I LIKE CONTROL OF THE MOUNTAIN INSTEAD OF HAVING THE MOUNTAIN CONTROL ME. WE'RE NOT GONNA TAKE ANY CHANCES. WE'RE GONNA MAKE **** SURE THESE TRAINS CAN GET THROUGH HERE SAFELY. YOU CAN SEE DOWN HERE WHERE THERE'S NO TREES. THAT'S WHERE WE'RE SHOOTING. AND YOU CAN SEE THE TRACK RUNNING UNDERNEATH IT. EACH HIGH-EXPLOSIVE ROUND CONTAINS FIVE POUNDS OF TNT. LOCK AND LOADED, TIGHTENED UP, AND READY TO GO. LET'S STAY FOCUSED ON OUR **** HERE. LET'S GET MOVING. HEY, CHEESE, SUPER QUICK! TUBE IS CLEAR. TUBE CLEAR. LOADED. CLEAR, RED HOT. CLEAR, READY TO FIRE! REPORT! WELL, WE JUST PUT A GOOD ROUND UP THERE, BUT NOTHING HAPPENED YET. A LITTLE BIT HIGH. SOMETIMES, THE MAGIC WORKS, AND SOMETIMES, IT DOESN'T. WE'RE GONNA SWITCH THE GUN POSITION. READY? GO, GO. LET'S GET THIS DONE. HEY, CHEESE, SUPER QUICK! LOADED. CLEAR, RED HOT. CLEAR, READY TO FIRE! OKAY, GOOD. REPORT. OOH. THAT'S A GOOD SHOT. I HEAR A RUMBLING. HERE IT IS. GOT ONE. LOOK AT THAT. THAT'S BIG. HOLY **** WELL, I GUESS IT NEEDED TO GET SHOT. NEEDED TO GET SHOT, DAVE. HECK, WE GET TO BLOW UP A MOUNTAIN... PRETTY SWEET. CAN'T BEAT THIS JOB. THE AVALANCHE IS EVEN BIGGER THAN THEY EXPECTED. IT WOULD'VE COMPLETELY DESTROYED A PASSING TRAIN, BUT THE TRAIN STILL CAN'T RUN. THE TRACKS ARE NOW BURIED IN 30 FEET OF SNOW. HOLY MACKEREL! THAT'S NOT GOOD. LET'S CLEAN IT UP? OKAY. LET'S GO! WE'VE GOT A LOT MORE WORK AHEAD OF US. BUT WE'VE GOT THE RIGHT EQUIPMENT TO GET ON IT AND GET IT DONE. THEY MOVE IN THE RAILROAD'S BIGGEST EXCAVATOR. IT'S JUST ONE OF 200 SPECIALIST MACHINES CREWS USE TO MAINTAIN THE STATE'S 656 MILES OF TRACK. HEY, JIM, I THINK YOU CAN GET THIS CLEANED UP FAIRLY GOOD. IT'S JUST MORE LONG THAN STACKED UP HIGH. I'M PROBABLY GONNA HAVE TO MAKE A COUPLE PASSES ON THIS. JUST REAP IT OUT, GET THE TRACKS OPEN, AND WE'LL GO. THE TEAM IS DEDICATED TO CLEARING THE LINE EVEN THOUGH THERE IS A RISK THAT MORE AVALANCHES COULD FOLLOW. THE TRACKS ARE SHUT DOWN. THAT'S GONNA TAKE SEVERAL HOURS TO GET CLEANED UP. NOTHING COULD GET THROUGH THERE NOW. IN THE PORT OF WHITTIER, IT'S 3:00. IT'S BEEN SIX HOURS SINCE DANNY AND ANIMAL STARTED UNLOADING THE BARGE. FINALLY, THEY ARE READY TO ROLL, WITH THEIR FREIGHT TRAIN CARRYING URGENT SUPPLIES AND SNOW-CLEARING EQUIPMENT. THEY NEED TO GET TO ANCHORAGE BEFORE NIGHTFALL TO AVOID BAD WEATHER THAT'S MOVING IN. WE GOT TWO LOCOMOTIVES, BOTH 3,000, SO WE HAVE 6,000 HORSEPOWER. HOW ARE WE DOING FOR TIME, DANNO? IT'S GETTING CRITICAL, BUT WE'RE STILL ON THE GOOD SIDE OF IT. WE AIN'T GOT MUCH TIME. IT'LL BE CLOSE. ALL RIGHT, WELL, LET'S GO DO IT. LET'S GET ON AND GET OUT OF HERE. TURN AND BURN. HERE WE GO. READY TO TOW? SURE WAS GOOD TO GET OUT OF THAT HOLE BEFORE THE WEATHER STOPPED US, RIGHT? YES, IT IS. GETTING A GOOD EYE VIEW OF THEM HOT LOADS. HOT LOADS. THE FREIGHT TRAIN IS 1 1/2 MILES LONG. ITS 6,000 HORSEPOWER ENGINES ARE POWERING IT TOWARDS BRUCE'S AVALANCHE ZONE AT 25 MILES PER HOUR. TIME IS RUNNING OUT. IF HIS CREW CAN'T CLEAR THE TRACKS IN TIME, DANNY AND ANIMAL WON'T MAKE IT THROUGH TO ANCHORAGE. WE HAVE TWO HOURS LEFT. NEED TO GET A MOVE ON. THE TRAIN'S COMING THIS WAY, AND I STILL HAVE A LOT OF SNOW TO REMOVE OFF THE TRACK, SO THE PRESSURE'S ON. HEY, JIM, A LITTLE UPDATE FROM YOU, PLEASE. IT'S GONNA BE TIGHT. I DEFINITELY NEED THE DOZER HERE. MIKE, LET'S JUST GET OUT OF HERE AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE AND GET BACK HOME SAFELY. OVER. ROGER THAT. WE GOT TO GET ON IT AND GET IT DONE. THE TRAIN'S 17 MILES AWAY, BEARING DOWN ON US. NOTHING LIKE A BIG DOSE OF PRESSURE. WHEN YOU'RE PUSHING SNOW OFF AND YOUR VISIBILITY IS BAD, YOU CAN'T TELL WHERE THE EDGES ARE. YOU JUST GOT TO WATCH TILL THE SNOW FALLS OFF YOUR BLADE AND THEN BACK UP. 200 MILES NORTH, IT'S 20 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT. OFF-GRIDDER JOHN WILSON HAS BEEN WAITING AT THE SIDE OF THE TRACK FOR OVER AN HOUR, BUT THERE'S STILL NO SIGN OF THE TUNDRA TRUCK WITH HIS DIESEL. THE TUNDRA WILL NORMALLY COME JUST ONCE A MONTH, SO I ORDER MY FUEL IN ADVANCE. A GOOD PORTION OF IT WILL GO IN THE GENERATOR, YOU KNOW, FOR ELECTRICITY. I CAN JUST IMAGINE WITHOUT THE RAILROAD, TRYING TO GET IT UP HERE. IT'S GONNA BE IMPOSSIBLE. FURTHER DOWN THE TRACK, JIM AND NANCY JAMES ARE ALSO WAITING FOR THEIR PROPANE TO BE DELIVERED. YOU OKAY? YEAH, YEAH, I'M JUST GONNA WARM MY HANDS UP. THERE'S A MOOSE UP THE TRAIL. A LITTLE ONE. THAT'S ALL WE NEED TO RUN INTO TODAY. THIS IS GETTING PRETTY SCARY RIGHT NOW. WITH THE TEMPERATURES AND LACK OF PROPANE, IT'S GETTING LIFE-THREATENING. THE TUNDRA TRUCK WON'T GET THROUGH UNTIL HUGH AND HIS CREW REPLACE A CRUSHED RAIL ON THE ROUTE TO JIM AND NANCY. THE TUNDRA TRUCK'S GONNA BE HERE IN ABOUT AN HOUR. AN HOUR? YEAH. OKAY. WE'LL TRY TO GET IT DONE BY THEN. I THINK WE'RE READY TO DRILL. I'LL GIVE YOU SOME JUICE HERE. THE TRACK IS MADE FROM CARBON-STEEL ALLOY. IT'S NOT AS TOUGH AS TOOL STEEL. IT IF WERE, IT WOULD BE FAR TOO BRITTLE FOR ALASKA'S ICY CLIMATE, AND TRACKS WOULD CRACK MORE OFTEN. MAKE SURE WE'RE GETTING ENOUGH FLUID THROUGH THERE. THERE'S NO WATER COMING OUT. WHAT THE HELL? SHOOT. SOMETHING IS PLUGGING IT UP. LET ME LOOK AT THAT BIT. WHAT DO WE GOT? IT LOOKS LIKE THE BIT'S GETTING **** YEAH, IT'S WEARING ON THE SIDE THERE. SEE? WE NEED A NEW BIT. THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING, I GUESS. **** WE GOT TO GET OUT OF THE WAY HERE, 'CAUSE WE GOT THE TUNDRA TRUCK GETTING PRETTY DAMN CLOSE THERE, SO WE NEED TO GET THIS TAKEN CARE OF. HUGH EVANS AND HIS MAINTENANCE CREW ARE SCRAMBLING TO FIX THEIR DRILL SO THEY CAN REPLACE A DAMAGED RAIL. THE TUNDRA TRUCK CARRYING DIESEL FOR JOHN AND PROPANE FOR JIM AND NANCY WON'T GET THROUGH THEIR SECTION OF TRACK UNTIL THE JOB'S DONE. THIS IS ABOUT AS REMOTE AS YOU GET. THE PEOPLE THAT STAY OUT HERE YEAR-ROUND, THEY TOUGH IT OUT ALL WINTER, AND THEY DEPEND ON THE TUNDRA, YOU KNOW, TO COME. SO IF THESE PEOPLE RUN OUT OF PROPANE, THEY'RE NOT GONNA LAST VERY LONG OUT HERE. IT'S GONNA BE TRAGIC, ACTUALLY. WE'RE THE ONLY ONES THAT CAN BRING THIS OUT TO THEM. I BET IT'S 15, 20 BELOW DOWN HERE. IT'S ALWAYS COLD DOWN HERE. WELL, AT LEAST THE WIND STOPPED A LITTLE BIT. I THINK IT'S SPUN ALL THE WAY AS FAR AS IT NEEDS TO GO. JUST NEED TO GET IT OUT, YOU KNOW? YEAH, JUST NEEDS TO COME OUT. IT'S STARTING TO GO. YEAH. EVERYTHING'S A PAIN IN THE BUTT OUT HERE. SNOW GETS IN EVERYTHING. WHAT'S REALLY BAD... THE SNOW ALL MELTS, TURNS TO ICE, THEN YOU GOT ICE IN EVERYTHING. THAT CAN MESS EVERYTHING UP. GOT IT. MY GOD. LET ME SEE THAT. YEAH, IT WAS RUBBING HARD ON THE OUTSIDES THERE, AND IT'S BASICALLY SUPERHEATING IT. WELL, WE ONLY GOT ONE MORE HOLE TO DRILL HERE. YEP. WE'LL FIX THIS ONE. OKAY. WE NEED TO OIL THESE THINGS UP. YOU ALWAYS NEED LUBE WHEN YOU STICK SOMETHING IN A LITTLE HOLE OR SOMETHING THERE. EASY, BROTHER. IT SHOULD WORK GOOD NOW. TWIST IT AND TURN IT BEFORE THAT TUNDRA TRUCK GETS HERE, PLEASE. HERE IT COMES. IT LOOKS GOOD. WE GOT IT PUT TOGETHER. ANTHONY, GO AHEAD AND DO YOUR THING THERE. ALL RIGHT, WE'VE STILL GOT A BIG GAP AT THE OTHER END. GET THE FireSnake GOING. WE HEAT THE RAIL WITH THE FireSnake TO EXPAND THE RAILS SO THAT THE JOINTS COME BACK TOGETHER. THE SMOKE'S TOXIC, SO YOU WANT THE HEAT. YOU DON'T WANT THE SMOKE. IT COULD BE BAD. ANYTIME YOU'RE NOT SWINGING A HAMMER OR BREAKING YOUR BACK, I GUESS YOU COULD CONSIDER THAT BEING FUN. WE'RE GONNA ABLE TO HAVE EVERYTHING BOLTED UP AND SPIKED IN, SO IT'S A REAL RELIEF. ALL RIGHT. WE'RE ALL SPIKED UP. OKAY. IT'S LOOKING GOOD HERE. IT LOOKS REAL GOOD. **** YEAH, IT LOOKS GOOD. I GOT THAT GROUND DOWN THERE, TOO. OKAY. GOOD. WE'RE DOING GOOD. ALL RIGHT. WE GOT THAT TUNDRA TRUCK SITTING DOWN THERE WAITING ON US. WE NEED TO GET OUT OF THE WAY HERE. ALL RIGHT. LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. OKAY. ALL RIGHT. GOOD JOB. A FEW MINOR MISHAPS THROUGHOUT THE DAY. YOU KNOW, EXPECT THE UNEXPECTED... THAT'S PRETTY MUCH THE STORY OF MY LIFE ON THIS RAILROAD, BUT WE GOT THROUGH IT. **** THE FITTING'S STUCK OPEN. IT WAS JUST FREELY DUMPING HYDRAULIC OIL IN MY LAP. IT LOOKS LIKE I PISSED MYSELF. DEFINITELY BE WASHING SOME CLOTHES TONIGHT. WE HAD A PRETTY HECTIC DAY TODAY. BROKEN-DOWN TRUCKS, A BROKEN RAIL. THE CREW DID A REAL GOOD JOB. THEY PULLED THROUGH FOR ME. I GOT TO GET GOING. IT TAKES A STRONG BREED OF PEOPLE TO TAKE AND BE OUT HERE, DEALING WITH THESE CONDITIONS. TWO MILES SOUTH, LONER JOHN WILSON IS BRAVING FREEZING CONDITIONS, WAITING FOR HIS FUEL DELIVERY. I CAN SEE IT ON THE FAR END DOWN THERE. WELL, YOU'RE BASICALLY CONFINED BY THE WINTER TO THE CABIN. IT'S LIKE BEING IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT FOR SIX MONTHS. YOU LITERALLY GO NUTS. WHEN I SEE SOMEONE, I RAMBLE REALLY FAST, 'CAUSE I HAVEN'T SAID A WORD TO A PERSON IN LIKE A MONTH. HOW YOU DOING? GOOD. HOW YOU DOING? GOOD TO SEE YOU. YOU GUYS ARE MY ONLY VISITORS. BY THE WAY, YOU KNOW? YOU KNOW, YOU GUYS ARE LIKE THE ONLY HUMAN BEINGS I'VE TALKED TO IN LIKE TWO, THREE WEEKS, YOU KNOW? I DON'T HAVE PHONE SERVICE, SO I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHEN A LOT TIMES RIGHT BEFORE YOU GET HERE. YEAH. SO YOU'VE GROWN UP HERE YOUR WHOLE LIFE THEN? THIS IS WHERE MY PARENTS LIVED WHEN I WAS BORN. YEAH. AND MY MOM WENT INTO TOWN TO THE HOSPITAL FOR ME TO BE BORN. AND SHE HAD ME IN A LAUNDRY BASKET WHEN THEY WERE GETTING READY TO GET OFF HERE AT GOLD CREEK, AND THE BAGGAGE MAN THOUGHT I WAS LAUNDRY IN A BASKET AND JUST THREW ME OFF IN A SNOWBANK. THE TRAIN WAS STILL ROLLING TO A STOP, AND HE JUST THREW ME OFF. MAN, THAT'S AMAZING. BUT I MADE IT. I'M HERE. YEAH. YEAH. I'M GONNA FIRE THIS UP. GOOD. PRETTY HANDY SYSTEM. ALL RIGHT. THERE WE GO. PUT IT RIGHT IN. JUST LIKE THAT. ALL RIGHT, JOHN, YOU TAKE CARE. YES. THANK YOU, SIR. YOU'RE WELCOME. WE GOT A FUEL STATION, AND I'LL JUST GET HER GOING. THAT'S ALL I NEEDED. HAVE A FRESH BARREL OF FUEL. DO YOU HEAR SOMETHING? I THINK I HEARD SOMETHING. I THINK I HEAR SOMETHING COMING. IT'S HARD FOR ME TO HEAR THINGS WITH THIS HAT ON. THERE IT IS. ALL RIGHT. FINALLY. I'M GLAD TO SEE THAT UGLY THING COMING. I WAS JUST ABOUT READY TO GO HOME. HOW YOU DOING, JIM? HOW'S IT GOING? THANK YOU FOR COMING. YOU'RE WELCOME. GOOD. FINALLY GOT THE DAMN PROPANE, AND IT IS ONE HELL OF A RELIEF. IT'S A GOOD THING. WE HAVE PROPANE. YOU CAN NEVER TAKE ANYTHING FOR GRANTED WHEN YOU'RE BUSH RAT. YOU HAVE TO COUNT ON THE UNEXPECTED, BECAUSE I GUARANTEE YOU, THAT'S WHAT WILL HAPPEN. THANKS A LOT. WE WILL SEE YOU ALL NEXT TRIP. BACK IN THE AVALANCHE ZONE, BRUCE GOUGH'S CREW IS STILL BATTLING FREEZING TEMPERATURES TO CLEAR SNOW FROM THE TRACKS SO THAT DANNY AND ANIMAL'S FREIGHT TRAIN TO ANCHORAGE CAN GET THROUGH. LET'S CHECK THIS OUT REAL QUICK. THERE'S 10 FEET THERE. SO WE GOT 30 FEET HERE. LOOK HOW HARD THAT IS. THAT'S HARD AS A ROCK, LIKE CEMENT. BEFORE BRUCE CAN GIVE THE ALL CLEAR, HE MUST MAKE SURE THAT THE FORCE OF HIS MAN-MADE AVALANCHE HASN'T DAMAGED THE TRACKS. IF THEY'VE BEEN PUSHED APART, THE TRAIN WILL DERAIL. WHAT DO YOU GOT THERE, BRUCE? I GOT 56 1/2. PERFECT. OKAY. BRUCE MAY HAVE GOTTEN A MAJOR AVALANCHE OUT OF THE WAY, BUT THERE'S ALWAYS A CHANCE THAT MORE COULD FOLLOW. JUST BECAUSE WE'VE SHOT AN AVALANCHE DOWN DOESN'T MEAN THAT ANOTHER AVALANCHE CAN'T HAPPEN. NOTHING IS CERTAIN UNTIL DANNY AND ANIMAL'S FREIGHT TRAIN PASSES THROUGH THE DANGER ZONE. WHEN THAT TRAIN COMES THROUGH, WE'VE DONE OUR JOB. DANNY AND ANIMAL'S FREIGHT TRAIN IS ON ITS WAY TO ANCHORAGE, WHERE THE HEAVY EQUIPMENT THEY CARRY IS DESPERATELY NEEDED TO CLEAR SNOW AFTER A STORM, BUT THERE'S DANGER AHEAD. AVALANCHE CONDITIONS ARE RIPE. IT COULD HAPPEN REAL EASY. THE POSSIBILITIES ARE HIGH. I'VE BEEN IN TWO ON THIS RAILROAD IN MY CAREER. AND I **** WELL DON'T WANT TO BE IN ANOTHER ONE. I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA SEE GOD FIRSTHAND. AT THE SLIDE ZONE, BRUCE AND HIS CREW ARE ON STANDBY TO WATCH THE TRAIN ROLL BY IN CASE ANYTHING HAPPENS. THE TRAIN CREWS ALWAYS APPRECIATE WHEN WE'RE OUT THERE GIVING THE ROLL-BYS. IT GIVES THEM A "YOU'RE GOOD TO GO." DANNY AND ANIMAL'S TRAIN IS ABOUT TO ENTER THE SLIDE ZONE. THEY SLOW DOWN TO REDUCE THE RISK OF TRIGGERING FURTHER AVALANCHES THAT COULD WIPE THEM OUT. HERE WE ARE. LOOK AT THAT BABY. THERE'S QUITE A BIT OF SNOW ON THAT SLIDE. HOLY SMOKE! GLAD WE WEREN'T UNDER THIS WHEN IT CAME DOWN. ME TOO. PRETTY IMPRESSIVE. EVERYTHING LOOKS GOOD RIGHT NOW. YOU ALWAYS WANT TO TAKE CLOSE ATTENTION TO UNUSUAL LOADS LIKE THIS. LOOKING GOOD. SUCCESS. AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE LIKE TO SEE. SLIDE ZONE'S IN GREAT SHAPE. THE BOYS CLEANED THEM UP, SO WE GET THIS FREIGHT HOME AND WE GET OFF THIS "MOFRAPPER." YES, WE DO. ANOTHER ADVENTURE, ANOTHER DAY. THIS SHIPMENT TO ANCHORAGE IS JUST A SMALL PART OF THE 5 1/2 MILLION TONS OF FREIGHT THAT THE RAILROAD WILL DELIVER THIS YEAR. ANIMAL, WE MADE IT, BROTHER. YES. BRING THAT FREIGHT HOME. GOOD JOB. IT WAS. BROTHER, WITH YOU, IT'S ALWAYS A GOOD TRIP. A LOT OF THIS FREIGHT THAT COMES UP HERE THAT'S HOT, THEY WANT IT TODAY. IN MOST CASES, THEY WANTED IT YESTERDAY. BOTH THE TRUCKS ARE HERE. TOMORROW, THEY'LL BE UTILIZED. MAKES US HAPPY. PAYS MY BILLS. IT'S BEER-THIRTY. BACK OFF-GRID, JOHN WILSON HAS FILLED HIS GENERATOR WITH DIESEL AND CAN ENJOY ONE OF LIFE'S LUXURIES. SHOULD I TURN IT ON? AND WE HAVE LIGHTS. AFTER A TOUGH DAY, JIM AND NANCY HAVE ALSO MADE IT BACK TO THEIR CABIN. WELL, WE FINALLY GOT SOME PROPANE, AND I'M VERY EXCITED AND HAPPY, AND I THINK JIM CAN GET CALMED DOWN NOW. STARTING TO GET A LITTLE TENSE THERE FOR A WHILE, BUT NOW THE TRAUMATIC PART IS OVER WITH. I'M GONNA LEAVE THE COOKING TO JIM. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S GOING TO MAKE UP, BUT I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT. CAJUN STEW à LA MOOSE. IT'S NICE HAVING THE PROPANE BACK, ISN'T IT? YOU'VE GOTTEN SOFT IN YOUR OLD AGE, MY LOVE. I KNOW. NOW HERE COMES THE FUN PART. YOU WANT ME TO DO IT? NO, I'VE GOT IT. WELL, I GOT MOST OF IT **** I'LL CLEAN THAT UP. ALL RIGHT. THE BIRDS WILL EAT IT. ALL RIGHT, SWEETHEART. IT NEVER DID WARM UP TODAY. IT'S JUST BEEN VERY COLD. THIS HAS BEEN A LITTLE TRAUMATIC FOR US ALL. THERE'S ALWAYS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT ON LIFESTYLE. AND IF YOU GO ABOUT THINGS THE RIGHT WAY, IT'S A NICE, SMOOTH TRAIL. EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE, THERE'S GOING TO BE A BUMP THAT COMES ALONG, AND THEN LIFE IS NOT BEAUTIFUL ANYMORE. IT BECOMES WORK. IT BECOMES AGGRAVATION. AND I DON'T NEED AGGRAVATION. I'M TOO OLD FOR THAT. THAT BIRD CAME. THERE'S ANOTHER ONE. I SEE HIM. NOW HE'S SURE CHECKING IT OUT. HERE HE COMES. THERE HE GOES.
