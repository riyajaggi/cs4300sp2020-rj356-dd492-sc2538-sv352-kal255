 Sanford and Son (1972–1977): Season 1, Episode 9 - Coffins for Sale - full transcript 
 Lamont brings home a pair of old wooden coffins that he bought at an auction, but superstitious Fred wants nothing to do with them. Attempting to sell them to a funeral director, Lamont and the man can't agree on a price. When Fred finds out that the coffins are going to spend the night in the front room, he decides to sleep out on the truck. After the house gets quiet, Lamont gets a little edgy himself and eventually ends up joining Fred outside.

HOW WOULD YOU LIKE ONE ACROSS YOUR LIP? SURE. THAT'S ALWAYS YOUR ANSWER. JUST DON'T CALL ME NO LIAR. DON'T GIVE ME THAT NONSENSE ABOUT D-DAY AND VIVE LA FRANCE AND ALL OF THAT. WELL, I WAS IN THE ARMY. I COULD'VE BEEN IN THE AIR FORCE. THEY WERE LOOKIN' FOR A TAIL GUNNER AND I TURNED THAT DOWN. - WHY? - I AIN'T GONNA SIT IN THE BACK OF NO PLANE. WOULD YOU STOP. YOU WASN'T IN NO ARMY. YOU TALK THAT OLD STUFF. COME ON OUT HERE AND HELP ME UNLOAD THIS TRUCK, YOU OLD FAKER. FAKER? THAT'S RIGHT. YOU JUST DON'T KNOW. YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE I'VE BEEN.

THAT'S RIGHT, AND CONTINUE ON DOWN FROM THERE. WHEN HE WHIPPED, HE WHIPPED FROM THE LIPS TO THE HIPS. AND YOU THINK THAT'S THE ANSWER? IT MIGHT NOT BE THE ANSWER, BUT IT SURE WAS NO QUESTION WHEN HE FINISHED. POP, THE KIDS TODAY DON'T WANNA HEAR NONSENSE. THEY WANT THE TRUTH. THE TRUTH SHALL SET YOU FREE. YEAH. YOUR UNCLE EDGAR THOUGHT THE SAME THING. TRUTH WOULD SET HIM FREE, AND HE TOLD THE TRUTH, AND THE JUDGE GAVE HIM SIX MONTHS. OH! OH, MY HEART! I THINK I'M HAVING A HEART ATTACK. YOU HEAR THAT, ELIZABETH? I'M COMING TO JOIN YOU, HONEY. AND YOUR DUMMY SON, HE'S BROUGHT ME A WOODEN OVERCOAT. OH, ELIZABETH. - WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU? - THEM COFFINS, AIN'T THEY? OF COURSE THEY'RE COFFINS, BUT THEY CAN'T HURT YOU. COME OVER HERE. DON'T BOTHER ME. DON'T TOUCH ME. I'M NOT GOING NEAR THEM THINGS. JUST TAKE IT EASY. NOW, LISTEN. LISTEN. THERE'S NOBODY IN HERE. LISTEN. ANYBODY IN THERE? [ High Voice ] NO. DON'T DO THAT. HAVEN'T YOU EVER SEEN COFFINS BEFORE? YEAH, BUT NOT IN MY OWN BACKYARD. GET 'EM OUT OF HERE. I PAID $25 FOR THESE. I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU PAID FOR 'EM. GET 'EM OUT OF HERE. LISTEN TO ME. WE CAN MAKE OURSELVES A NICE LITTLE PROFIT ON THESE THINGS. I BOUGHT 'EM AT AN AUCTION. NOBODY ELSE WOULD BID ON 'EM. NOBODY WOULD BID ON 'EM BUT AN UNDERTAKER AND A DUMMY. AND YOU AIN'T NO UNDERTAKER. WOULD YOU STOP THAT AND START THINKING LIKE A BUSINESSMAN. I'M TELLING YOU, WE CAN MAKE A HUNDRED PERCENT PROFIT ON THESE THINGS. WHAT'S WRONG WITH 'EM? I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE THEY LAST YEAR'S MODEL. COFFINS ARE LIKE BATHTUBS. THEY NEVER GO OUT OF STYLE. I DON'T LIKE BATHTUBS. I TAKE A SHOWER. JUST GET 'EM OUT OF HERE. WOULD YOU LISTEN TO ME? WE ALL HAVE TO GO SOMETIME. SOMEBODY'S GONNA NEED THESE COFFINS, AND THEY'LL COME AND TAKE 'EM OFF OUR HANDS. I HOPE IF THEY NEED 'EM, THEY COME AND TAKE 'EM BEFORE THEY NEED 'EM. THAT'S WHEN WE'LL MAKE OURSELVES A NICE LITTLE PROFIT ON THE DEAL, OKAY? OKAY, BUT THEY AIN'T STAYIN' OUT HERE IN THE YARD. OF COURSE NOT. THEY'RE GOING IN THE HOUSE. WHAT? YOU DON'T THINK I'M GONNA LEAVE 'EM OUT HERE. THEY'LL GET RUINED OUT HERE. THEY AIN'T GOING IN THE HOUSE. THEY'RE NOT STAYING OUT HERE. AND THEY AIN'T GOING IN THE HOUSE. OH, YES, THEY ARE. NO, THEY'RE NOT. OVER MY DEAD BODY. WELL, THAT'S ONE SALE WE GOT. WHICH ONE DO YOU WANT? I THINK THEY'RE BOTH THE SAME SIZE. AND THEY'RE A GOOD COLOR. BROWN WILL GO WITH ANYTHING. SO WILL THIS BROWN GO WITH ANYTHING. WOULD YOU GRAB THE OTHER END WHEN I SLIDE THIS OUT, OKAY? I AIN'T GOING IN FIRST. MAKE ME FEEL LIKE A PALLBEARER. THAT'S A BAD SIGN, HAVIN' COFFINS IN THE HOUSE. YOU BELIEVE ALL THEM SILLY SUPERSTITIONS, DON'T YOU? DON'T OPEN AN UMBRELLA IN THE HOUSE. DON'T YOUR SHOES ON THE TABLE. DON'T PUT YOUR HAT ON THE BED. PUT IT RIGHT DOWN HERE. AND WHAT'S THAT OTHER ONE YOU TOLD ME THAT TIME? OH, YEAH. A CAT YOWLING AT MIDNIGHT MEANS THERE'S GONNA BE A DEATH IN THE HOUSE. COME AND HELP ME GET THE OTHER. YOU CAN THINK WHAT YOU WANT TO, BUT IT HAPPENED. HAPPENED TO MY COUSIN RICHARD. CAT YOWLED AND YOWLED... AND YOWLED OUTSIDE THE HOUSE ALL NIGHT. THEY FOUND HIM THE NEXT MORNING, DEAD. POP, THE CAT WAS YOWLING 'CAUSE HE NEVER SAW ANYBODY THAT LIQUORED UP. AND AS FOR YOUR COUSIN RICHARD, THEY FOUND HIM DEAD, ALL RIGHT. HE WAS DEAD DRUNK. GRAB THAT OTHER END. I SURE DON'T LIKE TO TOUCH THESE THINGS. WOULD YOU GET IN THERE? I AIN'T GOING IN FIRST. HAVEN'T YOU EVER HEARD OF THAT OLD SAYIN', “THE SECOND TIME THROUGH YOU GOTTA GO FEET FIRST”? - OH. I DIDN'T... I DIDN'T REMEMBER THAT. - YEAH. OKAY, YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU SEE THAT? I JUST MADE THAT UP AND YOU BELIEVED ME. THAT'S HOW SUPERSTITIONS GET STARTED. YEAH, BUT WHAT ABOUT WHEN ALL THEM PIGEONS... GATHERED ON TOP OF MISS JOHNSON'S HOUSE, AND I TOLD YOU THAT I WAS A BAD SIGN? I SAID MISS JOHNSON'S NOT GONNA BE AROUND LONG. AND WITHIN A YEAR, SHE WAS DEAD. POP, MISS JOHNSON WAS 97 YEARS OLD. WELL, THE PIGEONS KNEW IT. THEY KNEW THEY HAD TO TAKE A REST. PIGEONS CAN'T FLY FOREVER. WHY'D THEY HAVE TO REST ON TOP OF HER ROOF? YOU CAN'T ANSWER THAT, CAN YOU? I CAN'T ANSWER THAT 'CAUSE IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. THAT'S PART OF THE NONSENSE THAT WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT. AIN'T NO NONSENSE. IT'S A BAD SIGN. YOU GET THESE THINGS OUT OF HERE. YOU TURNED THIS HOUSE INTO A PLACE OF MOURNING. AND I SUPPOSE UP UNTIL NOW THIS JUNKYARD HAS BEEN FUN CITY. I THINK THESE COFFINS KIND OF CHEER THE PLACE UP. DON'T SIT DOWN ON THAT. THAT'S A BAD SIGN. SOMETHING AWFUL WILL HAPPEN. POP, IF THAT WAS THE CASE, THERE WOULDN'T BE AN UNDERTAKER ALIVE. THEY'RE SURROUNDED BY THESE THINGS ALL DAY. YEAH, BUT THAT'S DIFFERENT. THAT'S THEIR JOB. AND IT'S NOT A BAD ONE. THAT'S NOT A BAD BUSINESS TO GET INTO. LISTEN. YOU'D MAKE A REAL FINE UNDERTAKER. YOU GOT COLD HANDS. DON'T TOUCH ME. AND A NICE SAD KISSER. YOU'D DO REAL GOOD. I CAN SEE IT NOW. “SANFORD AND SON, FUNERAL DIRECTORS”" “IMMEDIATE FAMILY, RIGHT THIS WAY TO THE FIRST ROW, PLEASE.” YOU STOP TALKIN' LIKE THAT. YOU WATCH AND SEE. - SOMETHING AWFUL'S GONNA HAPPEN. - DON'T WORRY. JUST RELAX. WE'LL HAVE A CUSTOMER FOR THESE THINGS BEFORE THE DAY IS OVER. ON THE WAY HOME I STOPPED BY THE BARBERSHOP TO SPREAD THE WORD. WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO IN THE MEANTIME, STRETCH OUT IN 'EM AND WATCH TV? YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT'S NOT A BAD IDEA. SHUT UP. LISTEN. IF WE CAN'T SELL THESE, WE COULD CUT THE BACK OUT AND MAKE A SOFA OR A COUCH. HUSH. IF WE ONLY SELL ONE OF 'EM, WE CAN CUT THE OTHER ONE IN HALF... AND WE CAN MAKE MATCHING END TABLES. THAT'S RIGHT. WE AIN'T NEVER HAD MATCHING END TABLES. - WHAT DO YOU SAY, POP? - DON'T CALL ME POP. YOU DON'T SOUND LIKE NO SON OF MINE. YOU SOUND LIKE THE SON OF FRANKENSTEIN. YOU REALLY ARE RIDICULOUS. [ Knocking On Door ] YOU SEE? THERE'S A CUSTOMER ALREADY. WELL, THERE GOES OUR MATCHING END TABLES. YEAH? MR. SANFORD? I'M NELSON LEE DAVIS OF THE DAVIS FUNERAL HOME. OH, YEAH.

WOULD YOU STOP THAT. WHY DO YOU ASK, MR. DAVIS? I AIN'T SAID NOTHIN' TO YOU. WELL, I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW A LITTLE ABOUT THE CONSTRUCTION. FOR EXAMPLE, ARE THEY LINED WITH COPPER OR ZINC? - IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE. - NOT TO THE ONE WHO'S GETTING IN 'EM. WOULD YOU STOP IT. BESIDES, THEY ARE RATHER PLAIN, AREN'T THEY? WHAT WERE YOU THINKING OF ASKING FOR THEM? FIFTY DOLLARS APIECE. FIFTY DOLLARS? NO, NO, NO, NO. WELL, WHAT WERE YOU THINKING? I WAS THINKING $25, FOR THE TWO. YOU KNOW SOMETHING?

COME ON BACK IN THE HOUSE AND WATCH SOME TV. I'M NOT COMING BACK IN WHILE YOU GOT THOSE TWO THINGS IN YOUR LIVING ROOM. I DON'T WANNA GO IN THERE EITHER. DO YOU KNOW ANYBODY AROUND THAT MIGHT BE ABLE TO USE ONE? IF HE CAN USE IT, HE AIN'T NO LONGER AROUND. ON THE OTHER HAND, IF HE'S AROUND, HE CAN'T USE IT. IT'S A TOUGH ITEM TO SELL. SORT OF LIKE SELLING CHRISTMAS TREES THE DAY AFTER CHRISTMAS. YEAH, I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT. WHAT'D YOU LET HIM BUY THEM THINGS FOR ANYWAY? I DIDN'T. YOU KNOW HOW KIDS ARE TODAY. THEY GOT WHAT THEY CALL “DOING THEIR THING.” HE WON'T EVEN LISTEN. I GUESS WE WERE THE SAME WAY WHEN WE WERE YOUNG, FRED. YEAH. DID YOU LISTEN TO YOUR FATHER?

YOU MEAN YOU'RE ACTUALLY GONNA SLEEP OUT THERE ON THE TRUCK? THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. ALL THAT SMELL OF GASOLINE AND STUFF OUT THERE. GASOLINE CLEARS MY SINUSES. BUT WHAT ABOUT YOUR ARTHRITIS? THAT'S BAD FOR YOUR ARTHRITIS. I'VE SLEPT UNDER WORSE CONDITIONS IN THE TRENCHES. THE TRENCHES? THAT'S RIGHT. THEY HAD TRENCHES AT FORT DIX. THIS IS REALLY RIDICULOUS.
