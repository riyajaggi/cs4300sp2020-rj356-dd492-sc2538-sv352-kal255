WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? I'M TALKING ABOUT A NEW TV. WITH THE BIG SCREEN. AND REMOTE CONTROL. AND COLOR. I ALREADY TOLD YOU, WE CAN'T AFFORD A NEW TELEVISION. AND I'M NOT SPENDING MY HARD-EARNED MONEY SO YOU CAN SIT AROUND ALL DAY... WITH YOUR BUDDY, WATCHING TV AND DRINKING BEER. WELL, I GUESS I BETTER BE GOING. STAY, MELVIN. YOU CAN'T BE THROWIN' MY FRIENDS OUT THE HOUSE. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? THROWING HIM OUT. MELVIN WAS LEAVING. LET HIM LEAVE. GOOD-BYE, MELVIN. STAY, MELVIN. THIS IS MY HOUSE. I GOT SOMETHING TO SAY TOO. SAY GOOD-BYE. YOUR FRIEND IS LEAVING. DON'T MOVE, MELVIN. COME ON BACK IN HERE. MELVIN, IF YOU WANNA GO, GO. STAY, MELVIN. GO, MELVIN. NO, MELVIN. YOU GUYS FIGURE IT OUT, AND I'LL SEE YOU LATER. THAT'S A TERRIBLE WAY TO TREAT SOMEBODY... WHO COME OVER TO SPEND THE EVENING WITH YOU. YEAH, AND KEEP YOU AWAY FROM DOING YOUR WORK. I DID MY WORK. WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO? WHAT DO I WANT YOU TO DO? WHY DON'T YOU CLEAN UP OUTSIDE? YOU KNOW WHAT THAT JUNKYARD LOOKS LIKE? A JUNKYARD. JUST LOOK AT THIS HOUSE. IT'S A GOOD THING THERE'S A WALL OVER THERE... OR I WOULDN'T KNOW WHERE THE YARD ENDS AND THE HOUSE BEGINS. THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES TO MAKE A HOME. YOU EVER HEAR THAT SAYING? “IT TAKES A HEAP OF LIVING TO MAKE A HOME.” WELL, YOU LOOK IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS HEAP, THERE'S NOT ONE DECENT TELEVISION. I ALREADY TOLD YOU, I AM NOT BUYING NO NEW TELEVISION. WHY NOT? WE CAN AFFORD IT. WE GOT MONEY SAVED. BECAUSE I'M GONNA BUY SOMETHING THAT'S MORE IMPORTANT. LIKE WHAT? STICK AROUND AND YOU'LL FIND OUT. HELLO. GAIL? HOW YOU DOING? THIS IS LAMONT. HEY, GUESS WHAT. I BOUGHT A CAR. A WHAT? A CAR. A LITTLE CONVERTIBLE. OH! I KNEW YOU'D BE SURPRISED. OH, THIS IS A BAD ONE. THIS IS THE WORST ONE I EVER HAD. WOULD YOU MIND WAITING UNTIL I GET OFF THE PHONE BEFORE YOU HAVE A HEART ATTACK? HE BOUGHT A CAR. HE BOUGHT A NEW CAR. LISTEN. IT'S NOT NEW. IT'S USED. BUT IT'S JUST AS GOOD AS NEW. A CAR. WHAT DO WE NEED WITH A CAR? SO ME AND YOU CAN GET AROUND, SUGAR. LISTEN. YOU KNOW, I WAS JUST THINKING. SATURDAY MORNING, MAYBE WE COULD GET TOGETHER... AND PACK A LITTLE PICNIC BASKET... AND RIDE UP THE COASTLINE A WAYS, WITH THE WIND IN OUR HAIR. YOU WOULD? TERRIFIC. I'LL PICK YOU UP SATURDAY MORNING. CIAO, BABY. I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU. I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'D BUY A NEW CAR AND I NEED A NEW TV. - YOU ALWAYS THINK ABOUT YOURSELF. - WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? - YOU'LL BE ABLE TO RIDE IN IT. - AND LET THE WIND BLOW THROUGH MY SCALP. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO TELL YOU 'CAUSE I'VE ALREADY PAID FOR IT. AND NOT ONLY THAT, I'M PICKING IT UP TOMORROW. YOU SELFISH. THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE. WHAT ABOUT ME? POP, LET'S FACE IT. I'M GETTING A CAR BECAUSE I NEED A CAR. I CAN'T CONTINUE TO TAKE OUT GIRLS IN THAT OLD BROKEN-DOWN TRUCK. WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE TRUCK? IF SHE WANTS HER HAIR TO BLOW IN THE WIND, LET HER TAKE HER WIG OFF AND HOLD IT OUT THE WINDOW. THERE'S NO USE. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND NOTHING. DO YOU REALIZE THAT EVERYBODY HAS A CAR TODAY? AND EVERYBODY HAS A COLOR TV. ARTHUR MATTHEWS'S SON BOUGHT HIM A COLOR TV. THAT'S A GOOD SON. GOOD AND KIND AND THOUGHTFUL. POP, ARTHUR MATTHEWS'S SON IS A CROOK. YOU TOLD ME THAT YOURSELF. HE'S A GAMBLER AND A HUSTLER AND A THIEF. IF A BUM LIKE THAT CAN BUY HIS UGLY FATHER A TV, WHY CAN'T YOU GET YOUR HANDSOME DAD ONE? SO NOW I'M NOT EVEN AS GOOD AS ARTHUR MATTHEWS'S SON, HUH? I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU COULD GO ON LIVING WITH SOMEBODY LIKE ME. WELL, I AIN'T, I CAN'T, I'M NOT, AND I'M LEAVING. WHY DON'T YOU GO OVER TO ARTHUR MATTHEWS'S HOUSE? YOU CAN WATCH TELEVISION WITH HIM AND HIS UGLY WIFE. BE LIKE A ROSE BETWEEN TWO THORNS. I'D RATHER BE OVER THERE SITTING BETWEEN TWO UGLY PEOPLE WATCHING TV THAN TO BE HERE WITH YOU. - I'M LEAVING. - WELL, GO ON, ROSIE. I'M LEAVING. AND YOU KNOW THAT TRIP YOU MENTIONED ABOUT GOING UP THE COASTLINE? WHEN YOU START OUT THERE, I HOPE YOU RUN OUT OF GAS... ON A MOUNTAIN. AND THE FILLING STATION IS TEN MILES AWAY... UPHILL. AND WHEN YOU GET THERE, I HOPE IT'S CLOSED. THANKS A LOT. THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THIS TV. I USED TO WATCH A WHOLE LOT OF GOOD SHOWS ON THIS SET. JUST TURN IT ON. [ Honking ] HEY, POP, I GOT IT! WHOO! HEY, POP! HEY, POP, I WANT YOU TO SEE THE CAR. IT'S A BLUE CONVERTIBLE. IT'S A STICK. IT'S GOT... POP, COME OUT HERE AND SEE THE CAR. HEY, POP. HEY, SMITTY, OFFICER SWANHAUSER. WHAT'S UP? WE HAVE SOME UNPLEASANT NEWS FOR YOU. WHAT? THE IMPORTANT THING IS TO REMAIN CALM AND NOT GET TOO ALARMED AND PANICKED. THAT WON'T HELP ANYTHING. IN SITUATIONS LIKE THIS, YOU HAVE TO MAINTAIN CONTROL. SO TAKE IT EASY. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? JUST TAKE IT EASY! OKAY, WHAT HAPPENED? YOUR DAD IS IN THE HOSPITAL. - WHAT? - I'LL HANDLE THIS. YOUR DAD IS IN THE HOSPITAL. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? WHAT HAPPENED? YOUR OLD MAN GOT PICKED UP WANDERING AROUND ZONKED. - ZONKED? - IF YOU DON'T MIND, I'LL READ FROM THE OFFICIAL REPORT. “UNIDENTIFIED MALE, BLACK, APPROXIMATELY 60 TO 65, “LATER IDENTIFIED AS FRED SANFORD. “PRELIMINARY MEDICAL REPORTS INDICATING EXHAUSTION AND OVEREXPOSURE... “AFTER SUBJECT WAS DISCOVERED WANDERING AIMLESSLY IN DOWNTOWN AREA. - WHERE'S HE AT NOW? - HE'S IN THE COUNTY GENERAL HOSP... “THE SUBJECT, FRED SANFORD, WAS ADMITTED TO COUNTY GENERAL HOSPITAL, WHERE HIS CONDITION WAS TERMED SATISFACTORY.” - THEN HE'S ALL RIGHT. - YEAH. HE'S COOL. THE REPORT MAKES NO REFERENCE TO BODY TEMPERATURE. I THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO SPEND THE NIGHT AT A FRIEND'S HOUSE. I NEVER REALIZED HE'D END UP IN A HOSPITAL. I GOTTA GET TO HIM. HEY, SMITTY, WHAT'S THE FASTEST WAY TO GET TO THE HOSPITAL? GET RIGHT ON THE HARBOR FREEWAY TO THE SAN BERNARDINO AND GET OFF AT MISSION. - HARBOR, SAN BERNARDINO, GET OFF AT MISSION. - [ Swanhauser ] HOLD IT. YOU'RE GOING TO COUNTY GENERAL HOSPITAL. FASTEST WAY IS TO GET RIGHT ON THE HARBOR FREEWAY TO THE SAN BERNARDINO, OFF AT MISSION. AND REMEMBER, EASY NOW! STAY COLD! COOL. COOL! IN HERE, PLEASE. - DOCTOR? - [ Man ] YES? MR. SANFORD'S SON IS HERE. OH. THANK YOU, NURSE. HOW'S HE DOING, DOCTOR? WELL, HE'S COMING ALONG. WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH HIM? YOUR FATHER IS SUFFERING FROM LOSS OF MEMORY. AMNESIA. AMNESIA? HE'S NEVER HAD ANYTHING LIKE THAT BEFORE. HOW DID HE GET IT? WE REALLY DON'T KNOW. AMNESIA'S ONE OF THOSE MYSTERIOUS THINGS THAT CAN DEVELOP VERY QUICKLY. HMM. DOCTOR, I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SAY THIS, BUT MY FATHER'S BEEN KNOWN TO PLAY SOME PRETTY STRANGE TRICKS ON ME. IS IT POSSIBLE THAT HE COULD BE FAKING THIS WHOLE THING? ABSOLUTELY NOT. HOW WOULD YOU EXPLAIN A MAN WALKING THE STREETS LIKE THAT ALL NIGHT? AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, THIS IS YOUR CLASSIC AMNESIA. [ Fred ] THAT YOU, ARTHUR? TURN ON YOUR SET AND LET'S WATCH SOME COLOR TV. THAT'S WHAT HE DOES EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE. CALLS OUT FOR SOMEONE NAMED ARTHUR. THAT MEAN ANYTHING? I'M AFRAID IT DOES. IS THAT YOU, MELVIN? COME ON IN. LET'S WATCH SOME COLOR TV. ARE... ARE YOU HIS SOLE SUPPORT? YES. I WISH I HAD A COLOR TV. MAYBE I'LL GET ONE WHERE I'M GOING. YOU HEAR THAT, ELIZABETH? DO THEY HAVE COLOR TV UP THERE? WHO'S ELIZABETH? MY MOTHER. SHE'S DEAD. HE TALKS TO HER WHENEVER HE GETS UPSET. UH-HUH. WELL, THERE'S YOUR STORY. AN OLD MAN ALONE AT HOME. THE SON HAS TAKEN OVER AS HEAD OF THE FAMILY, REPLACED HIM. HE FEELS UNLOVED, UNWANTED. HIS LIFE AT HOME HAS BECOME INTOLERABLE. SO HIS UNCONSCIOUS MIND FINDS RELEASE BY BLOCKING OUT ALL MEMORY OF IT. YOU'LL FIND THAT A CORRECT ANALYSIS. ARE YOU THE PSYCHIATRIST? NO. I'M THE EAR, NOSE AND THROAT MAN. BUT I KNOW AS MUCH AS THEY DO. HE'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT, ISN'T HE? THAT'S UP TO YOU. HIS RECOVERY AND WELL-BEING IS ENTIRELY UP TO YOU. YOU'RE ALL HE'S GOT. YEAH.

BUT MY POP'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT? YES. HE'S A VERY HEALTHY MAN. HE SLEEPS WELL, EATS WELL. LAST NIGHT HE CHASED A NURSE OUT ONTO THE FIRE ESCAPE. WHAT KIND OF DOCTOR DID YOU SAY YOU WERE? EAR, NOSE AND THROAT. HOW DO YOU TREAT A PATIENT THAT HAS AMNESIA? WELL, THERE'S NO SPECIFIC CURE. BEST THING YOU CAN DO IS TAKE HIM HOME. TAKE HIM HOME? AND YOU THINK THAT'S THE BEST PLACE FOR HIM? ABSOLUTELY. HE SHOULD HAVE FAMILIAR SURROUNDINGS. HE SHOULD HAVE LOVING CARE AND ATTENTION. HE NEEDS A FEELING THAT LIFE ISN'T OVER FOR HIM, THAT THIS OLD WORLD IS STILL A PRETTY WONDERFUL PLACE TO LIVE IN. BESIDES, WE NEED THAT BED. OKAY. I'LL COME AND GET HIM IN THE MORNING. THAT'S THE BEST THING. HE NEEDS THE SOUND OF FRIENDLY VOICES AROUND HIM. I'LL BET YOU HE'S LISTENING TO US OUT HERE. IT'S PUT HIM IN A NICE, RELAXED MOOD. DO YOU THINK SO? ABSOLUTELY. YOU TWO GUYS HOLD IT DOWN SO I CAN GET SOME SLEEP. YOU GO BACK TO BED. YOU COME TOMORROW MORNING. I'M SURE THAT ONCE HE GETS HOME, HE'LL FEEL MUCH BETTER. THANKS. MR. SANFORD, YOU'RE NOT GOING HOME UNTIL TOMORROW. I DON'T WANNA GO HOME. I WANNA GET OUT TO THE FIRE ESCAPE. OH! WELL, HERE WE ARE, POP. HOME AT LAST. I DON'T LIVE HERE. THIS IS A DUMP. LISTEN.
