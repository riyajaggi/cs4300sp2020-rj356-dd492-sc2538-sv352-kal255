 Sanford and Son (1972–1977): Season 1, Episode 6 - We Were Robbed - full transcript 
 Fred is sweeping the floor when he accidentally elbows Lamont's valuable glass and porcelain collection. He sweeps the broken pieces into a dustpan and hides it in the refrigerator out in the yard, then knocks over some things in the house to make it look like a robbery had occurred. Lamont reports the "robbery" and Fred receives a commendation. While he is away, Lamont discovers the dustpan in the fridge and fakes a robbery himself, claiming that the crooks broke into his piggy bank and stole his money. He reveals the ruse, which forces Fred to confess to what he did.
