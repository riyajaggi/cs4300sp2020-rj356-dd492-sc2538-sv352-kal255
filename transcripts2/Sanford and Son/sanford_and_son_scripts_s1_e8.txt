I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU, POP. I WORK LIKE A FOOL OUT THERE. AND I BRING THE MONEY HOME. HAVEN'T YOU BEEN KEEPING A BUDGET? WHAT GOOD IS A BUDGET? IF YOU WANNA KNOW IF YOU'VE GOT ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY YOUR BILLS, YOU LOOK AT THE BUDGET. THE BUDGET TELLS YOU EVERYTHING THAT YOU NEED TO KNOW. I CAN PUT MY HAND IN THIS POCKET RIGHT HERE, AND THAT TELLS ME EVERYTHING I NEED TO KNOW. IF THERE AIN'T NO MONEY IN THERE, THEN THE BUDGET IS IN SERIOUS TROUBLE. DO YOU REALIZE THAT WE GOT BILLS HERE THAT RUN OVER 200 DOLLARS? THEN WE'RE IN SERIOUS TROUBLE. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? TO ASK THESE PEOPLE FOR MORE TIME.

THEY'RE GONNA BE THE FIRST ONES TO GIVE US TROUBLE. WHAT DO YOU WANNA CALL THEM FOR? THEY DON'T WANT NO CONVERSATION. THEY WANT SOME MONEY. WELL, YOU'RE THE PERSON THAT KEEPS ALL THE MONEY IN THIS FAMILY. WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE? AN EMPTY POCKET. THAT'S WHY I SAID PUT 'EM BACK IN THE MAILBOX. THE PHONE IS DEAD. EVERYBODY GOTTA DIE SOMETIME. YOU GO IN THE KITCHEN AND CHECK THE WATER AND THE GAS... AND I'LL SEE IF THEY DONE TURNED OFF THE ELECTRICITY. - WELL? - WATER'S ON. GAS OFF. WE'LL BE HUNGRY, BUT WE'LL BE CLEAN. I'M GOING UPSTAIRS AND FILL UP THE TUB WITH WATER BEFORE THEY TURN THAT OFF. OKAY. [ Knocking On Door ] SEE WHO THAT IS, BUT DON'T LET 'EM IN. NO MATTER WHAT THEY SAY, DON'T LET 'EM IN. YOU GOT THAT? GOT IT. ALL RIGHT. MR. SANFORD? HUH? I HAVE A SUMMONS FOR FRED SANFORD. UH, NO HABLE, SENOR. YOU'RE MR. SANFORD, AREN'T YOU?

SAY, POP, IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S GONNA STAY FOR A WHILE. HE'S EATING HIS LUNCH. THEY GOT US TRAPPED. BUT THAT'S ALL RIGHT. WE GONNA OUT-WAIT 'EM, JUST THE TWO OF US. YEAH. I GOT A IDEA. GO TO THE DOOR AND MAKE A LOT OF NOISE AND GET HIS ATTENTION. AND THEN I'LL SNEAK OUT FOR HELP. OH, THAT'S TERRIFIC. I SAW IT IN A MOVIE ONCE. RANDOLPH SCOTT AND HIS WIFE SURROUNDED IN A MOUNTAIN CABIN. INDIANS ALL THE WAY AROUND 'EM. ARAPAHO, SIOUX, CHEYENNE. AND RANDOLPH SCOTT SAY, "HONEY, YOU GO FOR HELP AND I'LL HOLD 'EM OFF." HE TOOK OUT BOTH GUNS AND STARTED SHOOTING ALL OVER THE PLACE. AND HIS WIFE CAME BACK A LITTLE WHILE LATER AND HAD 10,000 TEXAS RANGERS. YOU THINK THEY'LL ALL FIT IN THIS LIVING ROOM? YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. YOU DRAW THEIR ATTENTION... AND I'LL TAKE THE BILLS AND GO SEE IF I CAN GET SOMEBODY TO LOAN US THE MONEY. I GOT A BETTER IDEA THAN THAT. YOU HAVE? WE GO DOWN IN THE BASEMENT AND GET A COUPLE OF SHOVELS... AND WE'LL START DIGGING A TUNNEL. WE'LL DIG A DEEP TUNNEL ALL THE WAY DOWN INTO THE GROUND, UP THROUGH THE SEWER PIPE AND OUT INTO THE STREET. I LIKE YOUR IDEA BETTER THAN I LIKE MINE. I THOUGHT YOU WOULD. I'LL TAKE THE BILLS WITH US. AND ONCE WE GET OUT INTO THE STREET, I CAN PUT 'EM BACK IN THE MAILBOX. - IS HE STILL OUT THERE? - YEAH. LOOKS LIKE HE'S GONNA BE THERE FOR A LITTLE WHILE. IS THAT ALL THE FOOD WE GOT? IT'S ALL I COULD FIND. CAN OF PORK AND BEANS AND A CAN OF ZUCCHINI. AND THAT'S IT, HUH? THAT'S IT. I CAN'T EVEN GET TO THE MARKET WITH HIM OUT THERE. SO YOU CAN HAVE A LITTLE PORK AND BEANS NOW AND A LITTLE ZUCCHINI LATER... OR A LITTLE ZUCCHINI NOW AND A LITTLE PORK AND BEANS LATER. OR YOU CAN HAVE A LITTLE PORK AND BEANS AND A LITTLE ZUCCHINI NOW... OR A LITTLE ZUCCHINI AND A LITTLE PORK AND BEANS LATER. OR IF YOU LIKE THE PORK AND BEANS, YOU CAN HAVE THEM... AND I'LL TAKE THE ZUCCHINI, OR I CAN TAKE THE PORK AND BEANS... IF YOU LIKE THE ZUCCHINI, AND I'LL JUST KEEP THESE. SO WHAT WILL IT BE? THE ZUCCHINI OR THE PORK AND BEANS? HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN WE HAVE NO WAY OF HEATING THE FOOD? WELL, IN THAT CASE, YOU CAN HAVE SOME COLD PORK AND BEANS NOW AND SOME COLD ZUCCHINI LATER. OR YOU CAN HAVE... WILL YOU STOP THAT.

I'M FROM THE HAMLIN COLLECTION AGENCY, AND I'VE GOT AN ORDER TO REPOSSESS SOME FURNITURE... FROM THE LUAU LAYAWAY FURNITURE COMPANY. NOW, OPEN UP. [ Lamont ] YOU MUST BE OUT YOUR MIND. THEN I'M GONNA HAVE TO FORCE MY WAY IN. YEAH, AND YOU'LL BE IN A LOT OF TROUBLE. YEAH, YOU'LL BE IN A LOT OF TROUBLE... 'CAUSE WE GOT A LOT OF FRIENDS IN WASHINGTON, D.C. THAT'S RIGHT. WE HAVE?

ROBINSON SAY, "NYAH." AND JAMES CAGNEY SAY, [ Imitating Cagney ] "THEY WON'T BE BACK. I KNOW THEY'RE NOT COMING BACK." THEN HE RUSHED OUT THE FRONT DOOR... AND GOT CAUGHT IN A CROSSFIRE OF MACHINE GUNS. EDWARD G. ROBINSON SAY, "NYAH." AND WALLACE BEERY SAY, "OH!" ALL OF A SUDDEN, JAMES CAGNEY SAY, "THEY GOT ME, DIRTY RATS. THEY GOT ME." SEE? THAT WAS THE NAME OF THE PICTURE. "THEY ALWAYS COME BACK." I DON'T BELIEVE YOU. HERE YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT SOME OLD DUMB MOVIE... AND WE STUCK HERE IN THIS HOUSE WITHOUT NO GAS, NO HEAT, NO ELECTRICITY AND NO FOOD. WE GOT FOOD. WE GOT PORK AND BEANS AND ZUCCHINI. WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE?

WELL, DON'T YELL AT ME. YELL AT THAT GUY OUT THERE BLOCKIN' THE MARKET. HE'S NOT THE ONE THAT GOT ME INTO THIS THING. YOU DID. AND IT'S ALL BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO TAKE CARE OF NO BUSINESS AROUND HERE. WHO DON'T KNOW HOW TO TAKE CARE OF BUSINESS? CAN YOU DO BETTER? A SIX-YEAR-OLD KID COULD DO BETTER. WHY DON'T YOU GET A SIX-YEAR-OLD KID? BECAUSE I'M STUCK WITH YOU. IS THAT WHAT YOU ARE, STUCK? STUCK. WELL, YOU WON'T BE STUCK MUCH LONGER. ANY DAY NOW, I'LL BE GOING TO JOIN YOUR MOTHER.

AND WE'LL PAY HIM A LITTLE BIT EVERY WEEK UNTIL WE GET IT ALL PAID UP. IT'S A SHAME JUST TO WASTE A GOOD ACTING JOB LIKE THAT. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT THEN. WE WON'T GO OUT TO DINNER. WE'LL JUST STAY HOME AND EAT HERE AND YOU CAN SAVE THAT MONEY. WELL, WHAT ARE WE GONNA EAT? PORK AND BEANS AND ZUCCHINI. ARE YOU SERIOUS? UH-UH. JUST ANOTHER ONE OF MY GREAT ACTING JOBS.
