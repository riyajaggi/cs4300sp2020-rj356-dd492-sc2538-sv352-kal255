 Sanford and Son (1972–1977): Season 1, Episode 7 - A Pad for Lamont - full transcript 
 Fred busts up Lamont's romantic date with girlfriend Darlene, causing Lamont to decide that it is time the he get a place of his own. Moving out, he finds that living on his own is no picnic either. First, he has trouble finding a date, then he has trouble with an intruding landlady. Meanwhile, Fred has a string of dates, mostly widows, coming through on a nightly basis. Lamont comes back home and, too prideful to admit what really happened, tells his father that he is moving back home because he was worried about him being home alone.
