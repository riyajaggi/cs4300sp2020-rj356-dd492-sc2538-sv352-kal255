 Hey, hey! Clippity-clappity, clappity-clap! I've gotta tell you guys, when I'm not doing this show, I play a lot of video games. I don't know if you guys are into them a lot, but I love video games, anytime, all the time. I make love to my wife: "Get off me." Turn on PlayStation. I just want points, man.

[machine gun firing] The name's Chappelle. Bye, baby, I'll see you later. I love ya! [applause] I was recently overseas in Japan. I'm not braggin'. I got a lot of respect in Japan. I've never been treated so well by people. I would say that I was loved and feared at the same time. I have footage of my vacation, and I would like to share it with you right now. [melodramatic music playing] [loud rumbling] [screaming] Ahh... [Funkier music playing] Ohh! [coughing] All y'all right here, I got something for ya. I got something for all y'all. Oh, no, he pull his pants down! ♪ Ta-daaa ♪ That's no snake, honey. ♪ It's raining It's pouring... ♪ [siren blaring] Oh, snap! I thought you was locked up. [roaring] You have a problem, huh? Ooh! Oh, no! [squish, Godzilla roars] Yee! [electricity buzzing] Yah! Yeah! I'm from the streets, bitch! Oh, no! Oh, ooh! Hot, hot! Oh, no, not stick. Ahh! Ahh! Ah! [romantic piano music playing] Um... I'll call you sometime or come around or something. I'll be back. [roar] We're gonna take a quick commercial break. We'll be right back, folks, with more Chappelle's Show. So don't go anywhere. Man, I'm bored. I gotta go to the Chappelle show. You know, folks... Tonight is actually a very special night. I was in negotiations with Comedy Central to do a one-hour special-- much like I did on HBO. Very excited about it, and then, suddenly the negotiations fell apart 'cause they didn't have the money that I wanted. They won't budge. But they did, they did come up with enough money for me to do a two-minute special. Yes, and tonight, you are the lucky crowd that gets to see it. So everyone, just sit tight. I'm gonna go in the back and we're gonna start shootin' this puppy. All right, let's get it goin'. [funky music plays] [announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, give it up right now for Dave Chappelle! [cheers and applause] Whassup? How y'all feelin'? I gotta get right into it, I don't have a lot of time now. I wanna talk about the war. I wanna tell y'all how I really feel about the war. Y'all ready to hear how I feel about the war? Y'all ready to hear how I feel about Bush? Well, this is how I feel-- [buzzer] Thank you very much, good night! Fuckin' pay me! ♪ Chappelle's Show ♪ ♪ Better not bring your kids ♪ Hey, guys. Do any of you guys watch those documentaries on HBO ? Those, uh, Hookers and Johns ? [audience] Yeah. Did anybody see that one, Pimps Up, Ho's Down ? [applause] I just seen their new one, and I got an advanced copy on it, you're gonna love it. Check it out. Yeah, you know what I'm sayin'? Like, real hatin', man, that's like an art form, man. You know, it's like, you like a born hater. You know, like myself, a lot of cats think they hatin'. I mean, I'm mad at everything, man. Brother got a nice car-- "Man, why you got a car? I only got one car. "Why you got three cars or a wife or all that? Man, that's played out." I hate on a nigga 'til he's totally broke, and ain't got nothin' like me, you know what I'm sayin'? 'Cause, yeah, that's what real hatin' is all about, man. Hey, what's poppin', everybody? The evil star here, wanna welcome you to The Fifth Annual Player Haters Award, uh, ceremony. This gala affair, we, uh, we host this once a year. We honor the most prestigious verbal abusers, uh, on the planet. [heavy Korean accent] Again, I'm hating all them Koreans. [speaking Korean] Is that a cut on beauty? The Player Haters ball gives us an opportunity to hate on a diverse array of Mark-ass marks, trick-ass marks, punk bitches and skip-scap skanks and scallywags... Hos, heifers, hee-haws and hula hoops. Man, you oughta take that cane and beat whoever made that suit to death. [laughs] Why don't you vacuum that coat, man? Well, well, well! The most diabolical haters this side of the Mississippi. Buc nasty, what can I say about that suit that hasn't already been said about Afghanistan? It looks bombed out and depleted. And of course, the so-called "beautiful." Why don't you click your heels together three times and go back to Africa? And as for you, Boss Hogg, very insulting what you said about my coat. It's made out of your mother's pubic hair. Quite shitty. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go take my throne 'cause I'm a shoo-in... For hater of the year. The Player Haters ball is not always about hating on one another. We play games with each other, too. Like our annual photo flip. -[man] Oh. Damn. -[man1] Oh, my God. [man2] Little-ass teeth? Nigga got dolphin teeth. Arsenio hall teeth! He always says he doesn't want anyone to see him shine, but the nigga looks shiny to me. Looks like Malcolm X before he converted to Islam. [Effie] Next. [man2] Thank you, Miss Effie. Good lord, almighty, it's Osama bin Laden. That motherfucker pumped my gas in my car on the way over here. [man2] That's ironic, because I take yoga classes from him. Next picture, please. I like the song the girl sings, Papa, Don't Preach. I got a song for you too, bitch. It's called, Daughter, Don't Sing. Next picture, please. [man] It's boy George! Now, that man right there I'd hate to fight. She wears underwear with dick holes in 'em. [man] Now to present the award for Player Hater of the year-- Ice T.! [booing] You look like Bill Cosby on crack! I'd like to welcome all you ignorant-ass bitches, critics, complainers, disgruntled rappers, ha, and racists especially, to the Ninth Annual International Player Haters Ball! Oh, man, hate, hate, hate... [audience chanting] Hate, hate, hate, hate... Hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate. Oh, man, you corny! Next nigga say somethin' while I'm talkin' is gettin' shot, please believe that. [audience] Hate, hate, hate, hate, hate! So without further ado, let me give you the nominations for Player Hater of the year. Y'all ready? First up... Buc Nasty! [booing] Clap for me, bitch! Buc Nasty is nominated for... Getting his best friend's wife pregnant, then tricking his best friend into raising the little motherfucker. Yeah, holla at your boy. Damn, that's hateful! The next nominee is Pitbull. [booing] Pitbull is nominated for calling the police on the drug dealers that moved next door to his house, not because it was the right thing to do, just because he was jealous of all the money they was makin'. Pitbull! [barks] Finally, the one and only... Silky Johnson! [boos and applause] Silky Johnson is nominated for calling in a bomb threat to the special Olympics, man! [audience] Hate, hate, hate, hate, hate! The winner of The Ninth Annual Player Hater of the year award is... [man] Look like a bootleg Ice T.! Silky Johnston! [booing] Kiss my ass! I'm the biggest hater! Silky mink made out of 100% rat ass! Hit me, baby. That, of course, was beautiful talkin'. Beautiful on the weekends does stunts for little Richard in gay movies. [laughter] First off, I would like to thank God almighty for giving everybody so much... And me so little. I hate you, I hate you, I don't even know you, and I hate your guts. I hope all the bad things in life happen to you and nobody else but you. [booing] Hate, hate, hate, hate, hate! And as I sip my soda that I'm sure somebody spit in I just would like to say to all of you, kiss my ass, you rotten motherfuckers. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go home and put some water in Buc Nasty's mama's dish. Good evening. [laughter] Hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate... [cheers and applause] I will be right back, I will see you shortly. Come back, don't go anywhere.
