 you don't know what I'm talkin' about. Here's the highlights from the first season. [hip-hop music] [man] Congratulations. Y'all made it inside the house. You did good. Alright, this is what's up, you can live here, you can record here. you can be Bad Boy artists here, but if you wanna do it, first y'all gotta walk to Queens and get me a sugar cookie. A sugar cookie? Man, this is crazy. We got it. Come on, man. Bad Boy. A sugar cookie, man. Look, this is not what I got in the music business to be doing, to be a sugar cookie-getter. You know, I'm a rapper. Who are the five best rappers of all time? Think about it. Dylan, Dylan, Dylan, Dylan, and Dylan, because I spit hot fire. That's a good-ass sugar cookie. You guys are official now. Welcome to Bad Boy. It's Bad Boy, baby. Can't stop. Won't stop. Uh-uh, uh-uh. I'm sending y'all to the studio. I want you to turn Daddy out a hit, but I need you to be a family unit and love each other, or this will never work. That's right, man, that's right. Go out there and get Daddy a hit. I'm gonna take a nap. [audience laughing] [Dylan] What'd you do? [all shouting] [woman] Let 'em fight! Let 'em fight! [all clamoring] [woman] Let them fight! I'm shuttin' the studio down. [all scoff] The only way I could keep the studio open is if y'all go out and walk through Northern New Jersey, get me a set of left-handed golf clubs. I also need you to take a picture with a midget holdin' these balloons. Take a picture with a midget holdin' these balloons... Holdin' these balloons. You did it. You went out, you found my man... You found a midget, man, and you got the pictures, you got the golf clubs. Here's the keys to the studio. Now, if y'all excuse me, I'm going scuba diving with Chris Tucker and Aquaman. You be cool. Giddy-up. [people clamoring] [Dylan] Oh, my God! What's happening? We're supposed to be a family. What are you doing? Not like this, man! Y'all not workin' like a team. I gotta shut the studio down, yo. Alright, the only way I'll open the studio up now, y'all gotta walk Uptown to the Bronx and get breast milk from a Cambodian immigrant. I only drink the finest breast milks. Go out there and milk a Cambodian. [sighs] It's 100% Cambodian, yo. It's the real shit. [bottles clinking] ♪ Breast milk ♪ ♪ You made my day-ay ♪ Not only am I gonna open the studio up, I'm sendin' you in there with a legend. That's right, Wyclef, playboy.

This takes hard work. If I had my way, I'd never work. I'd just stay home all day, watch Scarface 50 times, eat a turkey sandwich, and have sex all fuckin' day. Then I'd dress up like a clown and surprise kids at schools. Then I'd take a dump in the back of a movie theater and just wait till somebody sat in it, hear it squish. That's funny to me. Then I'd paint, and read, and play violin. I'd climb the mountains and sing the songs that I like to sing. But I don't got that kind of time. Playboy? Playboy? You just gonna comb your hair, Playboy? Sarah, you just gonna talk up all your anytime minutes? Is this anytime? huh? Babs, you just gonna sit there and chop onions right now, huh? Good time to chop onions? Look at this nigga.

[audience cheering and applauding] You know, folks, I don't know about any of you guys, but I'm a parent, alright? There's a lot of wild things going on in the world, and it's very hard to explain these things to your children. That's alright, 'cause tonight, I'm going to help you. I have created a show that helps to explain the evils of the world to youth in a way that they can understand and that's palatable to them, and I hope you enjoy it. Here it is.

Hey, you better be careful when you're handlin' those things. That's not a dagger at all. It's called a syringe. People use it to inject a drug called heroin directly into their bloodstream. Why? Probably because you get higher that way than sniffing it. Bobble, why do people get high? Oh, very good question, young lady. For all kinds of reasons. Some people think they need it just to get through the day, and some people just like to party and can quit whenever they want, like me. Ah! Oh!
