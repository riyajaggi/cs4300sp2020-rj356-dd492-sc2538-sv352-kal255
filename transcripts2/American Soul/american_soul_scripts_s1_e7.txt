 ♪ Oh, baby, give me one more chance ♪ ♪ To show you that I love you... ♪ - What's good, dawg? - What's up, man? Here, take your stuff. You owe me 75 cents. Uh, actually, can you take that for me? I got to go drain the river. Way too much information, man. I second that emotion. Well, look what we have here. How you doing? My name's Fresh. Whoa, whoa. Where the hell - you think you're going, son? - Got to use the bathroom. Not here. Come on, sir. I'll only be two seconds. Colored bathroom's around back. Just dig a hole and squat. I said put that down! You're gonna pay for everything you touch, now, put it up on the counter where I can see it. Uh-uh. You heard Don, no drinking on tour. - Reflects badly on the brand. - Uh-uh. You cannot take that from me. I'm legal. - It's my constitutional right. - Call your congressman. You booze, you're benched. End of story. 16 hours on a bus playing glorified babysitter? This isn't drinking, - it's survival. - I like your hair. - Yeah? I like your hair, too. - Hey. The hell do you think you're doing, - talking to this boy like that? - Boy? Who you calling a boy? I'm a full-grown man. Calling you a boy, boy. Yeah. Take this boy away, boys. I'm-a catch you later. Get the hell back inside. Guys, come on. On the bus, come on. Afternoon. You people never listen. Where you going? - Kendall's not on the bus. - Hurry up. Last call, everyone on the bus! Wait, wait, wait. Hey, Wally, hit the horn. We got company. Kendall, what's taking so... Everybody settle down. Settle down. How about you get off the bus now, boy? Come on. I'm talking to you. Get out here! Outside now. Both of you. Outside! Move. We got to roll. This shit's getting hot. - What about Kendall and Simone? - Everyone settle down. I'll show these crackers what's up. Back up! Get back! - Back up! Back up. - Let's get out of here. - Won't be no trouble. - What's going on out there? Get away from the bus! Damn it, Fresh. Give me that. What are you, nuts? Get out of here! Oh, shit. Everyone down! They're leaving us! We got to get the hell out of here, Simone! Come on! We'll go back for them, I promise. ♪ ♪ Red, I'm home! Don! Welcome home, baby. Mm! Hmm. - Huh. Oh... - Merry almost Christmas, baby. I know you didn't wrap this. It's an answering machine. If I call, and you're out, it will record my message on the tape. That way, you'll never miss me. Well, no machine in the world can't stop me missing you, but thank you, baby. You gonna tighten me up later? Don't I always? So when's the bus getting here? Mm. Few hours. Got to stop by the station to meet Phil. But I wanted to get in early to see you and the boys. Maybe go house hunting. Well, now, that's my gift to you. I've already bought the perfect place. - You...? - Yeah. Where? Ta-da. You bought this house? - With my money? - Our money, Don. Red, this place is good for the insurance peddler and the grocery girl, but we aren't those people anymore. Look, I like working at that store. And I like this place. It's been good to us when times weren't. I did what was best for the family. And don't ask me to be sorry about that, Don. Mwah. Ugh! You want to walk a little faster? Those fools might still be coming. What? So now you're not talking to me? Look, I was not about to piss my pants - for some country-ass Klansman. - You think this is a joke? We are in the middle of nowhere, it's freezing and if we don't make it to Chicago, we might lose Soul Train. Hey. Where you going? What do you think you're doing? Gonna ask for a ride. And what if he's one of them, huh? How are you gonna outrun bullets? I am not gonna miss this tour stop, Kendall. I'll take my chances. It's gonna be a cold day today, sis. Why don't we get you something to eat, huh? Uh... Stay right here, okay? Shh. Just keep walking, man. Uh, excuse me. I'm Simone. This is my brother Kendall. Nick. If you guys are here to rob me, two cats in Wichita already beat you to it. You a musician? All my life. Folk and rock, mostly, - but I gig all over. - For real? We're actually about to cut a record out in L.A. - Gonna be gold, for sure. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. - Well, what are two future gold album recording stars doing in the middle of hickville? We were on our way to Chicago, but we missed our bus. You wouldn't happen to be headed that way, would you? Nah, I'm not going that far. But I could take you as far as McLean, if that helps. - Yes. Thank you. Yes. - Yes. Yes. You sure you're not gonna rob me? Only if you don't rob us first. That your Chevy Nova out there? - '63 blue Chevy Nova? - Yeah. It ain't for sale. That's cool, 'cause I ain't buying. I've been looking for that car for a long time, Mr. Tucker. Who the hell are you? Detective Patrick Lorraine. Gonna need you to come with me down to the station and answer a couple questions. Officer Wills! She'll take care of Aiya. You should go ahead and put that down. What's this all about? Let's not start off by lying to each other. Are you coming quietly or do you want to get your sister upset? ♪ I'm so tired of being alone... ♪ Hard to believe that this is where it all began. Still remember the day you pitched me the idea. You said that a show called Soul Train would never work. Boy, was I wrong. Don, you know I'm a straight shooter. - Mm-hmm. - Sit. Sit, sit. So I'm just gonna come out and say what's on my mind. Wouldn't have it any other way. 25% of Soul Train belongs to us. ♪ I want to come back, show me where... ♪ You suing me, Phil? Well, hopefully, it doesn't come to that. That whatever you create, we own a piece of it. ♪ So tired of being alone... ♪ I didn't sneak it into the fine print, Don. It's always been there. ♪ Soon as you can... ♪ If you want a fight, we can fight. But it'll drain you financially, and you'll still lose. ♪ I love you so... ♪ Do what you got to do, Phil. ♪ You don't want me no more ♪ ♪ Hey, hey, hey... ♪ This is Sandy. This is Jamie. Okay, but why do I care? Because John McMartin was Sandy's father and Jamie's husband. You murdered him. I didn't kill nobody. All right, then who did? Your vehicle matches the getaway car. You have ties to our known lead suspect. We found this in your bumper this morning. Confession's good for the soul, Jeffrey. Talk to me. Okay. But you might want to call somebody to pick up Aiya. You'll be here for a while. Thank you, thank you. Okay, okay. Oh, by the way, man, uh, here's a little something for gas. It's all I got on me. Forget the bread. Karma. It's what pays us back one way or another. Well, I called ahead to the hotel, - let everybody know we're okay. - Oh, great. Well, now we just got to catch the bus. And pay for it with what, Kendall? Well, if you guys are up for it, there's a little club in McLean, we can make some quick cash. If you're good. - Yeah? - You want to...? Do it. ♪ So darling, darling, stand ♪ ♪ By me, oh ♪ ♪ Stand by me ♪ ♪ Won't you stand by me? ♪ ♪ Stand by me, stand by me ♪ ♪ Stand by me ♪ ♪ Oh, stand ♪ ♪ By me ♪ ♪ Just as long as you stand ♪ ♪ By me. ♪ Ooh! Well, cats and kittens, it looks like we got ourselves a gig. - Yes! - Well, all right! So I'm going shopping with Joyce tomorrow. - Joyce? - Uh... you know she your favorite. - Raymond's doing good in school. - Mm. Good. Real good. You're pretty quiet tonight. - You okay? - Yeah. Ah, it's just work. That's all, baby. - Hmm. - Mm. - Not too tight. - Well, the tighter the braid, the bigger the fro. Now, what's wrong? Phil is trying to shake me down for a piece of Soul Train. Yeah, that smells like Phil. I talked to Miles. He said their case is strong. I could lose, Red. Now you listen to me. Nobody can take Soul Train from you. You are Soul Train. Yeah? - That's why I love you. - I love you. Mm, that's why I love you. What's wrong, baby? - I heard that noise again. - What noise? It's like a possum or a raccoon or something that's scratching - inside the walls. - Tony, go back to bed. There's nothing to be afraid of, all right? Look at me. Do I look worried? All right, when I look worried, then you can worry. Now get your butt back to bed. Look, I'll put him down. Come on, baby. Mac, I'm telling you, these guys are the real deal, man. And-and, I wouldn't have brought 'em here if I didn't think this crowd wasn't gonna love them, man. I almost fell out of the car, man, they're so good. Nick. These boys will chew them up - and spit them out if they soft. - Mac! Have I ever lied to you? Hey, you of age? This here ever work before? You heard of Dugan's in Hollywood? - Yeah. - Stop by next time I'm there. If you can get a seat. Three songs, 20 bucks. $30 for an hour, you got a deal. You won't regret it, Mac. We got a show. Now get backstage. - Have a good show, guys. - Come on. Dugan's, huh? So that's how you got so rich. - JT know? - He knows. JT and I don't have secrets. Hey, man, you hungry? Nah, I'm good, man. Hey, look, I know where you coming from, JT. I grew up a few blocks from here. I know exactly how hard it is to get out the streets. Especially with a mom on drugs and a dad in prison. How about we stick to subjects you actually know about? All right, fair enough. I think that Latch's boy, Reggie Michaels, was the triggerman. And I think you know that. I'm not after you, JT. Just give me Reggie and you can go back to making music. Living life with your friends. Hi, I'm Simone. Uh, this is my brother Kendall, our friend Nick. And we're gonna sing some songs for you guys.

Hey. How old are you, really? 17. Wow. There's a whole world waiting for you when you're ready. Yeah. You could be a star, Simone. You just got to be willing to put you first. What's up, little man? Man, what is this? Maurice here is up for parole in 18 months. I told him I'd put in a good word if he set you straight. It's been a long time. How's your mama? I got a baby sister now. Oh, yeah? Got to send her a card or something. You think a few letters make you a better father? How about writing when you not looking to make parole? What kind of trouble you in? - I'm not... - About to be in more trouble if you don't start telling me the truth. How do you do it? How do you live a life with blood on your hands? Everybody got blood on their hands. It's just a matter of degrees. I... I can't sleep. Always looking over my shoulder. I got caught up in this robbery... Keep your mouth shut. Don't make the mistakes I made, 'cause once you do, ain't no going back, now, you hear me? I would tell you don't do the crime, and stay out of here. Seeing as how I'm too late for all of that, I'll just say this: whatever you do, you got to lie. Go on the run. You got to out every last man in your crew. You do whatever it takes to stay the hell out of here. I'd rather you die first. Prison don't reform nobody. All you can be in there is the worst version of yourself.

Feels like everyone's mad at me. I wasn't mad. I was worried. I was worried about you, too. Still am. Okay? Talk to me. Back in Texas... ...my baby brother was gunned down in front of our house. He died in my arms. Being on that bus, seeing all those guns... - Hey. Hey. - I didn't know where you... Hey, I'm here now. Okay? You're not alone. I like you, Kendall. And I haven't liked someone in a really long time. - Shut up. - No, I-I promise you. Hey, baby. What are you still doing up? Too scared to sleep in his room. Tony. Aw. Now, what did Mama tell you? Hmm? It's probably just a squirrel or something, but it's nothing... - Come on, Tony. - Don. I got it. What did I tell you? Come on. Don't be scared. It ain't nothing but a possum. Now, you took a train across country trying to be a man. This is what manhood is, defending what is yours. No matter what it takes and no matter who tries to take it. Hold it. Shoot. Pull the trigger, Tony. Now! Give me that. Go upstairs. Hey, Captain, I'm in the middle of... I know what you're doing, Detective. But I thought you might want to have a look at this first. You're a good detective, Patrick, and you'd make a great lieutenant. First Negro lieutenant on the force. But I'm not up for promotion. You are now. I need men I can trust with the future of this department. As far as the public is concerned, the men responsible for Officer McMartin's death are dead. This case is closed. Lieutenant. Mr. Cornelius is here to see you. Mm. Great party last night, Don. - Great party. - Well, I'm glad you had a good time. I think the tour ended on a high note. I'm headed back to L.A., but I wanted to give you your cut. Glad you came around. Nice when things end the way they started, two friends - wanting the best for each other. Mr. Stewart, -you've got a call on line three. - Excuse me, Don. Oh, please. - Phil Stewart. - Hi, Phil. Hey, Ted. Good to hear your... Yeah, well, maybe not so much. We're pulling the plug - across the board. - T... N-No. - W-Wait a minute, Ted. I... - No, you wait. We had a deal, and you broke it. Now that's not the kind of arrangement -we want to deal with. Have a good day. - I see. That was Ted Banks from Woolworths. They just pulled their ads. Mr. Stewart, Sears and Marshall Field's are holding, and Mr. O'Hare is on line two. Thanks, Cindy. Um... What did you do? Well, they know what I know, Phil. I'm Soul Train. If I go, it's over. You'd really burn it all down? I gave you your shot, Phil. You turned down my offer to go national. Keep the Chicago show going, and we'll all make money for a long time. Or... we can watch it burn together. JT. Thought I was under arrest. Not today. Come on. Thanks again for all your help, JT. Ready? You wanted to see me, Marty? Yeah. I wanted to, uh... Well... Go to page 80. I didn't want to put them out before... Aw, hell, Delores. I'd trash them all if I could afford it. Listen, maybe... maybe you go home early today, huh? My shift's almost over. I'll be fine. Hi. Hello. Oh! - We love you, Simone. - Aw, thank you. You're so sweet. Thank you. Aw, I love you, Chicago. Bye, Simone! Girl, quit showing off. Bye, guys. Oh. Thank you so much. Bye, ladies. My little sister's growing up. It's got to happen sometime. Cool with that. Just stop the lying. You don't want to be that person. No guns, no booze. You all know the rules, right? Hey, kids. Chop-chop. Hey, baby. Can you hand me those shirts? Who the hell is Ilsa DeJarnette? - Hmm? - What are you talking about? Who is she, Don? She's nobody, Red. It's just business. - All right? - No, are you sleeping with her? It's not what it looks like, Red. - Okay? - No, I need the truth, Don. And you know what? It ain't even about you cheating, because I've lived with that for years. But you embarrassing me in front of my coworkers?! The whole damn country, Don?! - I can't deal with this right now, Delores. I will no-Oh, no. he - I got to catch a plane. - Oh, no. No. - We deal with this now. - Like I said, - we'll deal with this... - You hear me, Don? I knew this was gonna happen. Don't walk away from me. - You hear me talking to you. - I said it's not what. - Baby, I said it's not what it looks like. - W-Don, wait a minute.d. - All right? Already said it. - Don! If you walk out that door, you are choosing Soul Train over this family. We'll talk about this later. Don. Don! Don. - Next time on American Soul... - So, you're willing to do six cities a week for a year, - but the thought of us... - This has nothing - to do with you. - It never does, Tess. I will not let him drag you into everything your father and I fought so hard to keep you out of. You and Jeffrey are over. Just looking out for your mom, Kendall. She wants you to stay. And if you really cared about my mom, I wouldn't be the only one leaving. There's a lot of talk in these streets, JT, -and most of it says you a snitch. - And what do you say? - You should have taken the deal, Don. And I got no problem with the competition, but this? This is war.
