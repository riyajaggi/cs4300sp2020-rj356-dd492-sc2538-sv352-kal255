 KATE: Who pays your bills? Nice try. By the way, this phone... ...it's bugged. By you? Would I tell you if it was? Take care, Ms Ashby. (ENGINE STARTS) (MESSAGE ALERT) (MESSAGE ALERT) Where am I?

 Sorry. I was, er, in a meeting. Phone was switched off. - You OK? - Yeah, you know. I didn't expect you to still be here. Ah, well. Those are my absolute favourite. Any excuse, huh? In the country, I mean. I have some things to clear up first. Such as? You want to order? I'm not sure any of this is to my taste. You have not looked at it. You were set to go back immediately after your triumph in Paris.

 Yes, I was. But then suddenly Patrice Ganimana arrived here and you decided to stay. Why was that? Something tells me you already have an opinion on that. Tell me about Bibi Mundanzi. What do you want to know? You were brought up together? Yes. My family adopted her. So, like a sister? Like that. And now you want to bring her down - your sister? - Ah. - And you're waiting for the perfect moment to do it. You had one in France, but this one, this looks even better, doesn't it? At least you're not trying to tell me I'm wrong. - I am not trying to bring her down. - Then what? Ijust... I want her to make an adjustment. To what? Our constitution. To stop her running again? Too late. To ensure others can run against her. They can already. No, Kate, they cannot, not really. So how are you going to do it? Hmm! Erm...pick my moment... ...very carefully. And Michael's helping you to do this? You are going to have to ask him about that. I have. He keeps telling me to wait. But I've started to figure it all out by myself. You want the Ganimana extradition to fail. It has nothing to do with him, not really. Oh, I think so. You are waiting for your sister to look weak on the same international stage on which you just looked so strong. That's your moment, isn't it? Oh... - It is only a part of it. - But it's a part. You don't... ...you don't look too good right now, though. No, I, erm... -Idon't... - Did Michael put you up to this? - Hmm? - Get you to confess. No. So why did you call me? I did not. You sent me a text. Only to say that you were late. - Do...do not eat it. - What? - Don't eat what? - Did you eat anything? - No! - What did you ea...? - (ALICE RETCHES) - Nothing! Yes. Hello? Hello? Hello! Call an ambulance. Now! So, So, SO... C'est magnifique! Isn't it? Surprisingly, it's pretty good. How is she? Ripped out the lining of her stomach. - You're sure you didn't...? - No...Michael. - Why were you so late? - Iwas with... I was with a friend. Who? You think President Mundanzi runs a one-party state. De...de facto, yeah. So how the hell do you think you're going to change their constitution? Alice told you. You didn't tell me you two were lovers. A long time ago, yeah. - Don't lie to me, Michael... - I'm not. ...ever again. Oh, keep it. I have copies. Kate! Mr Viner? This is Kate Ashby. I am so sorry I didn't manage to get out to you last night. I was...unavoidably detained. But if it's OK, I could come now. I'd really like to see that file. Thank you. (DOOR CLANGS) - The other one first. -Hm? That one first! Hm! It's not exactly Fort Knox. - And what if there was a fire? - There wasn't. These are people's lives. (CHUCKLES) You know, the older you get, the more you realise... ...no-one gives a shit. There. 2..D. (MONITOR BEEPS) They're optimistic? Yes. Colostomy bag! Kind of takes the strain out of things, wouldn't you say? And guilt-free use of the disability loo. Except if it was the three of us, we'd have to stand in line. You not good? They're not too happy with my ovaries. Me neither. Got me a 30-year-old still living at home. You don't have kids, Eunice. Two things - never let the truth get in the way of a good gag and yet another reason to hate my ovaries. You're right. About Kate. Let her go to Rwanda. It'll raise her profile over there and that's what we need. Good. But she can't be out there alone. She won't want to go with me. She doesn't need you, Mikey. I've got someone else. He's been with her for a while. Shit. (PHONE RINGS) (RINGING CONTINUES) Pick her up. And you're sure that's everything? No, those are just the headlines. The bulk of the files will be - where those headlines say they are. -Hm. - In the UK? - No, no. Your mother did it for the ICTR, - so I guess they'll be in Arusha. - (PHONE RINGS) - (RINGING CONTINUES) - Tanzania. That's where the trials were held. There's no guarantee they won't have been destroyed either. The case never made it to an indictment. Why was that? Good question. Which only your mother could answer. (RINGING CONTINUES) You'll need to sign for it. Strict protocol. I liked your mother. She was strong. Too strong, maybe. Why? Well, storms come, weeds bend, oaks fall. Bit of country lore there, ol' timer? Whatever it is, young lady, I'm guessing it's what killed your mother. You just be sure it doesn't do the same to you. Are you expecting someone? Milkman. Too fast for a milkman. Do you have another way out? (KNOCK ON DOOR) Hi. Kate Ashby. Can I speak with her? Not here. It's one way in and one way out. If you give me no choice. We just going to stand here all day till you fall over? No need. Shit! Yes! Yes! (PHONE RINGS) Agh! Agh! Fuck! Shit! Shit! Fuck! (HORN BEEPS) (TYRES SQUEAL) - Why didn't you pick up the phone? - You bugged it. - What? - When you put your number - in my phone, you bugged it. - No! How else did you know I was here? Because I knew you would not call. So why are you wondering why I didn't answer? - Cos I could've killed him! - Yes! Yes, you could! You saw him first. - Huh?! -So? So why didn't you pick up the phone? How...? How can I begin to even get the logic of that? - Excuse me... - No! No! Not now. You are lucky to be alive. Where are you going? Oh, that's right, now you haven't got a phone to follow. I am trying to help you! Oh? Really? By flattening Lance Armstrong here? Thank you for that. What's in the box? You wish. He tell you where to take it? Who? David Runihura. Who do you work for? KATE: You. No. Eunice Clayton. - Eunice? -Mm. You work for the Americans? I work for Eunice, who happens to be one. And an Assistant Secretary, State Department. I do not work for them, just her. You knew about this? Just today. Why'd she want it? Well, after what happened to Alice. No, he'd been on me long before that. Since your mother got killed. You gave me that priest, his photo, in the catacombs. Did Eunice know about that? Yeah. Did you? No. Right, so we've both been screwed over. How does that make you feel?! Beginning to get used to it. Some of the things... - ...I do, methods I use, are... - Illegal. Tell me about it! Well, that's the thing, Eunice didn't want to. What's it to do with her? You know that photo that Alice gave you? Of her and Eve and me and Ed from all those years ago? Eunice took it. She and Ed worked at the same NGO. Oh. She wants to keep you safe. Not me - Alice Munezero. - Both. - Bullshit! Your employer is backing Alice Munezero to topple a sitting president. Give us a minute. (MICHAEL CLEARS HIS THROAT) (DOOR CLOSES) - I know how this looks. - Yeah, me too. You lot go to secret meetings with your trouser legs rolled up. Alice isn't looking to topple Mundanzi. Just to change the constitution. Yes, I know, we've had this conversation. The only way she can do that is to make Mundanzi look weak. And the best way to make her look weak is to make sure Patrice Ganimana is not extradited. No. So why didn't you give Runihura that file? - It was a mistake. - How many more? Fingers of my left hand, not including the thumb - it stops there. You should go to Rwanda. What, just to prove you right? Well, like I said, I'm not sure the Rwandan judiciary has the capability of trying a case like this, but if they do, Ganimana should be extradited, and I want to help. Why? We all make mistakes, Kate. Even you. You were wrong about your mother. She wanted to pursue Ganimana just as much as you do now. So why did she stop? Why anyone does. When there's no chance of success. Well, there is now. And if there is, I want to help... ...but on one condition. KATE: A Yankee spy?! No fucking way. Actually, I was born in Rwanda, just like you. I don't actually know where I was born, thank you very much. Ah, hence the weird accent. They'll know what you are. So what? Whatever it is they don't want being known, they're not going to tell you, whether I'm there or not. They're not going to tell me anything with some killer by my side. Who says I'm a killer? Something in your eye. You want to know the truth? I'm coming whether you like it or not, so do yourself a favour, at least let me carry that box. This your first time here, since...? You mean you don't already know the answer to that? Yah, it is. "Yah, itis." Me too. You know, you haven't even asked me my name. (FRENCH ACCENT) Florence. F-Florence! No. (FRENCH ACCENT) Florence. Oh? You got a problem with that? Baby, I've got a problem with everything. Florence Karamera. Florence Karamera. - So strange. - What is? To hear my name. What, since they gave it to you at spy school? Out loud. Here. Since I was a little boy. Never thought I'd come back. But here I am. (POLICEMEN SHOUT) Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop! Stop! Stop the car! (HORNS BEEP) Sorry. 0K? Hmm? Yeah. Your dress. DAVID: Are you well? I'm fine now, thank you. It has been a long journey for you. - But I'm here now. - Yes. You are. Welcome! Please. This looks new. It's a copy. - Not the original? - No. But everything in it's been copied across. Where is the original? Safe. And there is not more? Apparently, these are just the headlines but they should indicate where all the files are. In the UK? No. In Arusha, I believe. Ah! Fine. Very good. Excellent! We have everything we need. Ms Ashby, thank you. You have done us a huge service. Monsieur, how are you today? - You know who he is? - Yes. I know. I've been reading about you. Oh? Yes. And how does it feel to finally return to the country of your birth? It's OK, there is no need. I understand. So, this is Dirk Schreiber, an advisor on international crime working within our prosecution unit. - He will be the one to show you around. - Good morning. Dirk, this is Ms Kate Ashby, adopted daughter of the famous Eve. - And this is... - Florence Karamera. I'm... He is here to watch over us. So, I am Dirk Schreiber. As is my name, so is my job. Yeah. So, come, please, it is my duty now to show you Rwandan justice. I am employed entirely by the German government. Before that, I was at the ICC for seven years as an investigator. Now it is my job to offer an expert opinion on the ability of the domestic system here to prosecute international crime for whomsoever makes the request. - And what's your view? - For you to see things for yourself. The President. Who's that? I'm not informed, I'm sorry. I know him. DIRK: What she has done for this country. Allo! Allo! Why do you go crazy every time you're here? Cos I'm crazy wherever I go! Saw it in Lie-chester Square. Got the taxi to stop and everything. And why do you always take taxis? Ah! Hmm? Because I'm married to a national hero! (LAUGHS) Ah! I had a girlfriend like this once. This one's more lively, though. Hee! Di-di-doo! Maybe because you have your hand stuck up its arse. Oh? No, I tried that on the girlfriend too! - (LAUGHS) - Frank, I'm already ill. OK. The doctors say you can come home soon. Hmm? Police come up with anything? No. You? I've never lied to you. You know that. You have that girlfriend after we were married? But only after you decided to give yourself to your country. You did pretty well out of it. Did? Why the past tense? I, erm... I have something to give you. Open it. Do not play it. What is it? Something that must be heard... ...that people do not want to hear. That why they did this? Take it back. Keep it very, very safe. And when I finally return, bring it to me at the airport. This is real, Frank. If they look through your accounts, is everything clean? I mean everything. I took that Land Rover. Then you have to find yourself some insurance. What do you mean? In the accounts of other people? Oh, Alice! What's this all about? Is that what they teach you? Hmm? Wear a shirt like that? Weaken the female defence? - Will you shut up? - Hmm? It's a shirt I have. I did not think of you when I put it on. And yet you're here at all, when I didn't ask you. Have you ordered? Apparently, they drank the pool water here. Hmm. Everything around them. Whistles, pangas. Pool water. Tomorrow they want us to visit the memorials... Not me. I'm not going to be a tourist to my own history. Hello. What can I get for you? - Nothing. - Yet. Don't answer for me. Please, take your time. Yeah, I'll take what I want. I'm just out of sync, that's all. Sure. You probably know more about my past than I do. I'm guessing you've been given a file or some... - Not really. - Hmm? No? Well... ...not much to say. Then don't. Bellboy saw me to my room... ...showed me around, was a bit slow, I gave him a couple of dollars and as he turns to go, there's this huge scar right down the back of his head. Back home, I'm special. Here, I'm just one Tutsi amongst millions. His story, mine, theirs... ...all individual, but all the same. So, what's yours? Nothing you'd want to hear. Don't tell me what I want to hear. I'm Hutu. My father, erm... I'm not really sure what he was, but... ...he was pretty bad. Anyway, erm, as Mundanzi came in, we got out, into Zaire, in '94. Erm... Sorry, I... I don't really remember, like you, but... ...three years later they were dead. That I remember. Cholera. I was on my own and that's when things... - You...you were in a camp? - Everyone was in a camp. No. I became part of...a militia. First Congolese War. How old were you? Not old enough. But a few years later, IL... ...I got lucky. I got caught. I thought they were going to kill me... ...but, er, instead they... ...put me into this educational programme funded by your Yankees. And, er, when Iwas 13, they shipped me over there. High school, college, military. And...now here you are. Hmm. What's Eunice to do with it? She sponsored it...me. Well, that sounds familiar. Still the same story, just... from the other side. The wrong side. It wasn't your fault. Are you going to help me with this, erm...? Are you going to help me with this report? Yeah. - Yes? - Yeah. OK. OK. I, er, I think I'm ready to order. (PHONE RINGS) -Yo? - Michael? Kate. - Are you all right? - Yeah. Well, it's been two weeks. I haven't heard from you. We've been busy. And what have you found? The case construction is organised, purposeful and, I'm repeatedly told, unimpeded by any political intervention of any sort. Records are held in paper files, but are organised, safely kept and easily accessible in a unit specifically created for this purpose. I have been shown a singular case file on an Erik Mutsinzi - an ex-government officer accused of participation in the genocide, and whose trial I was given the opportunity to visit. Over the last few years, the law has been updated to match international standards. Death penalty's gone, guarantee of fair trial, unimpeded choice of defence lawyer, guarantee of cross-examination, guarantee of witness protection. All these appear to be present and standard. The central prison is old, but access to the defence team and a telephone is regular and unsurveilled. I've seen it for myself and believe it to be true. There is no evidence, and none has been suggested by the prisoners themselves, of torture or any form of maltreatment. Now, when you set this in the context of what these men are accused of, the level and extent of their injury to the people of this country, the State's restraint professionalism and even respect for the rights and wellbeing of these individuals is nothing short of remarkable. Listen, I know it's only been a little while, but based on the evidence I've been presented with so far, Patrice Ganimana could well stand trial here, in Rwanda. (MELANCHOLY MUSIC) (CRIES) (WALLS) She's coming. His birthday. KATE: Hm. You didn't say. His first here in many years. Happy birthday. (WHISPERS) Thanks. Much to celebrate, I think. (KNOCK ON DOOR) Just there! - (KNOCKING) - You go on down, I'll be there. (KNOCKING) I am a friend of Erik Mutsinzi. The man whose trial you visited. Right. The witness you saw giving evidence against him, she was lying. Answer no more. Yego, nabikubonera mu kwezi kundi. Well, that was pointless. The only reason people talk is if they're more afraid of you than the other person. She's not afraid of you. Go wait in the bar. FLORENCE: Sit down and listen. She will withdraw the evidence. Did you coerce her? Just went further up the food chain. Where? The factory used to be owned by the Mutsinzi family. And the new owner is worried that if he's released, he'll claim it back. So, he's got a worker to testify against him? Not only her. He did it himself. Shit. Perjury. - Hm, but that's not the problem. - Then, what is? The whole community knew he was doing it. So why didn't the defence counsel find out? Exactly. That's the problem. I've only just started, but I doubt if I can catch up. Why? Look about you. I do not have the resources. It is why the last man left. Why? They have changed the way we are paid. It is now a fixed fee. So? When it started, it was 30,000 francs per hour, but now it is 15 million, period. What's that? About $18,000. -So? - It is four years' work at least! Right. I can hardly afford to pay for a phone. Why didn't you say? They are still being paid. When you set it in the context of the average wage here... This...this isn't the average activity. It's a job that sits on the world stage. Do you realise how expensive that would be? Do you realise how necessary it is? You have to understand how far they have come. Don't. Don't infantilise this country! I'm not. I'm telling you this country could not afford what you suggest. So, this makes me very happy. So you can prove me wrong? So I can offer you help! How? The extraditing country - like, say, the UK - would also agree to foot the bill for a defence team of the accused's choice throughout the trial. A very interesting idea. Which you might explore? We do already have a provision for Western lawyers to work within our system. But not for defence counsels to be paid for directly by an extraditing state. It is just that, wherever possible, we are looking to cut our imperial apron strings, not...tighten them. Forgive me, but I thought you wanted to see justice done and for the whole world to see you do it. Madam President. This is Kate Ashby, the daughter of Eve, the lawyer. Thank you for everything that you are doing. Oh, I'm... I'm not sure I am. I am sure you are. - David, in five minutes, yes? - Of course. Have you seen the gorillas? Er, no, I haven't had the time. Isn't that what you all think we are here for where you come from? Erm, I... To protect the gorillas. Actually, I was born here. Oh, yes, I understand. But now from the UK. Yes? Yes. And in the UK, have you met your prime minister? No. And yet, somehow, you expect to meet me. Oh, no, I didn't, I just... Thank you for everything that you are doing. Five minutes, David! She can be a little...spiky. Perhaps I should not have set that up. You set that up? I must go. But there is one problem. Your mother's file, it has been very helpful. We are managing to locate everything we need, except for one article. This. That is the number for a file we cannot find. When you return to London, might you perhaps take another look? Well, I'm not sure where. What is it? That is what we would like to know. Please. What about the funding issue? Oh, feel free to approach whomever you wish. I couldn't do that. Then, who could? STURRIDGE: Can't think the issue of defence funding hasn't already been discussed. Only as a pro bono committee through the Attorney General's office, and that was before we had Patrice Ganimana holed up in a prime bit of London real estate. So, will you show this to the Minister? Who opened the doors for you in Rwanda? David Runihura, Special Advisor... Yeah, I know who he is, Michael. You know Rwanda is of particular interest to the Secretary of State. - Yes? -Hm. He was a junior at the FCO during the genocide. It caught him out. Wasn't exactly alone. But he's a great admirer of how the country managed to pick itself back up. Who isn't? I prosecuted one of the first cases at the ICTR. Yes, of course. Actually, we had Eunice Clayton in here the other day. Did you? Didn't realise she had her boots on the floor, as it were, during the whole horror of it. She was with an NGO. That how you met? Yeah. She has a very particular way of speaking, don't you find? Direct? Gynaecological. In, er, quite some discomfort, actually. I had to offer her a paracetamol. Perhaps that's what made her so ill-humoured. - I'm sorry to hear that. -Hm. Well, that and the fact that I'm not sure she and the Minister share quite the same...vision for that region. Which is? That Mundanzi went for a third term is, of course, a matter of deep regret for the democratic cause. However, after the salutary lessons of Libya, and with the scorch of burnt wool still permeating the Minister's wardrobe, the presence of a strong man, or woman, of Africa is, for the time being at least, felt to be far preferable to yet another descent into intertribal insanity. Which no-one is looking for. Of course not. How is Alice Munezero? She's not looking to topple the President. Hm. Although I applaud your directness, it is, of course, quite impossible for me to have heard what you just said. Though I'm bound to wonder what it is, exactly, this is really about. Oh, well... That's simple. It's about justice. Really? Absolutely. What else? David Runihura. You realise he's rumoured to be the Earl of Leicester to Mundanzi's Elizabeth? Yeah. And with Alice Munezero as Mary, Queen of Scots, you might just care to ask yourself, where does that place you? Fella named David Rizzio, I believe, was Mary's chief advisor and sometime lover. I'm presuming that didn't end well. But stabbed 56 times, Mikey, with a knife that long. They found almost as many divots in the floor beneath his body. Makes you wonder just how much he must have pissed people off, doesn't it? But then, perhaps, people like that never quite understand the true nature of their game. Safe journey. MICHAEL: (LAUGHS) Fuck you!
