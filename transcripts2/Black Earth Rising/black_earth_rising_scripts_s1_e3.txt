 (SINGLE PIANO NOTE) - Found you. - Didn't know you were looking. - Didn't realise you were leaving. - Just for the weekend. (COMPETENT BLUES RIFF) (TAPS OUT A TUNE) Oh, were you expecting money for that? I'll settle for appreciation. (SIGHS) A vent shaft? I thought it might be how he got away and... Yeah. What about the front door?

 Mm. Tat Picot. Exactly. Our little ex-French security operative... ...leaving your "hotel". - When? - Not long before you... ...locked horns with the manager. He thought I was crazy. Whatever gave him that idea? Although finding you semiconscious, covered in blood and mouthing off about a ghoul stuck in his air conditioning might have momentarily confused his judgment. Mm. But it's all right.

 Our friend just managed to spook you. Which can only mean one thing. You hit a nerve. (QUIET METALLIC TAPPING) (LOUD CLATTER) (DOGS BARKING) (TRANSLATED FROM FRENCH) (TRANSLATED FROM FRENCH) Mm. (SCALPEL SCRAPES) (DOOR OPENS) (DOOR CLOSES) You eating? Mm, thinking about it. - You? - No. Got something to do in the morning. Yeah? What? So, I'm going to try and get this judge to subpoena - our Mr Picot to appear before him. - Mm-hm. You think he'll do it? He should. He's the investigating magistrate, needs to hear both sides. He seemed keen to. Except we're talking the French secret service here. Except we're not. Interesting thing about this Picot fella - he was sacked from the secret service at exactly the same time as the first judge was retired. You think there's been a change of guard? Yes, Ido. And they're using us to weed the old ones out? Well, it'd be interesting to see if anyone else offers us any help. Hmm. (PHONE RINGING) KATE: Yes? MAN: You want to know what happened to that priest? Who is this? I can show you. OK. Where? Paris catacombs. - Catacombs? - Two hours. No. I'm not comfortable with that. - You are afraid? - Well, yeah. Duh. That I will hurt you? Why do you say that? You are staying in room 2189. The lock is easily slippable. You walked through a subway last night alone. So if I wanted to hurt you... Why... Why are you watching me? Because you are in danger. Who from? Everyone. I won't come alone. You are alone. That is why I have to help you. How will I find you? I have found you already. (LINE CLICKS) (PHONE RINGING) Please leave a message after the tone. (BEEP) Michael, I just had a very weird call from a guy. Says he can help. Says I'm in danger. C-Call me back. Morning, Michael. Here we go again. You ready? For the chance to piss blood for the next two weeks? Who wouldn't be? (CHUCKLES) You'll be home by tea-time. And dead in a year. - Oh, give me some credit. - Give me six months. Please. You'll be fine. You've said that before. Yes. And you're still here. KATE: Michael. This is my third message. I'm here now, and not totally sure what to do. Give me a call. (FOOTSTEPS CRUNCH) I did not think you would come. Then you're a man who makes mistakes. Yeah. Many. And, er...what is this? You do your laptop work here, too? Millions of people down here. Maybe six. You know that? Sorry. With all the cloak-and-dagger, I forgot to pick up a fact-sheet on my way down. Almost as many were killed in the Congolese wars. Did you know that? Well, no-one knows exactly how many for sure. Or cares. At least, up here. MAN: If only the dead could talk, eh? What do you think they would say? "Hurry up, we've got a steampunk convention here at midday"? Nothing you have been told is true. Nothing. Everything you have heard is a lie, from everyone. Everyone. (WATER DRIPPING) (UNZIPS BAG) Except this. The priest, Father Patenaude. He's alive. PRIEST: Gloria Patri, et Filio, et Spiritui Sancto. Sicut erat in principio, et nunc, et semper, et in saecula saeculorum. (HELICOPTER APPROACHES) Amen. (DOGS HOWLING AND BARKING) (HELICOPTER RUMBLES OVERHEAD) (DOGS BARKING) (FLIES BUZZING) (DOOR BURSTS OPEN) (DOGS SNARLING AND BARKING) (CACOPHONY) (DOGS BARKING) (TRANSLATED FROM FRENCH) Regardez! (IN ENGLISH) Look at what I've done. Look at what I've done! (FLIES BUZZING) (BUZZING INTENSIFIES) (FLY BUZZES) KATE: Is this your son? INTERPRETER: Elle veut savoir si c'est Pascal. MADAME PATENAUDE: Je... Je suis pas certaine. Je peux pas dire. Je sais pas. - INTERPRETER: She cannot tell. - KATE: Mm-hm. I know this must be very distressing. Itis. But if there's anything about this man you recognise... Elle veut que tu regardes de nouveau. Tu es certaine, vraiment pas? Non, je sais pas. WHISPERING: Je sais pas, je sais pas. Je sais pas. Please, my aunt is not well. This is not good for her. Please. - Please, if you can... - No, please, enough! (CHURCH BELLS CHIMING) (DRIPPING WATER ECHOES) I'm sorry. You don't recognise him? I recognise all who answer the call of Saint Benedict. But this one, individually? In the brotherhood, we are all one. Is that why you're protecting him? Who? Pascal Patenaude. You'd have to lie to answer that, wouldn't you? Actually... ...in, er... ...Exodus 1:19... ...the midwives lie to the Pharaoh. - To save the children. - Yes, yes. You know your scripture. No. Then how...? I don't know. I just...knew. The Lord...is always here. And here, always. Not in mine. Not me. I kicked him out a long time ago. No-one's beyond the reach of the Almighty, mademoiselle. Or the law, Monsieur Abbot, if you are found to be obstructing it. - Why are you so...? - Angry? - Suspicious? - Mm... - Of you? - Yes. I'm a genocide survivor. Rwanda? I'm told I was found outside one of your churches. One of mine? No-one is beyond the reach of the Almighty, Abbot. Although of the hundreds they found in there, apparently I was the only one alive. I see. If you really did... ...you would help me identify that man. (SCRUBBING) (BELL CHIMES) (BELL CHIMES) (PHONE RINGING) (HE ZIPS UP) (WHISTLES TUNELESSLY) MICHAEL: And your flight was OK? And your hotel? I'm so sorry we had to fly you all the way over here, but I have a medical condition which means I can't travel long distances at the moment. And I understand you have a very interesting story to tell us. It is not a story. She is a witness. Of course. I'm so very sorry that you have to revisit such a dreadful part of your past. But we're so very grateful that you're willing to do it. So, please... ...whenever you're ready... You realise she cannot speak? - Yes. - She has not spoken since that day. Since April 8th 1994? The first days of the genocide? But she can sign. A British charity taught her. I will interpret. That is OK? That is exactly the reason I've asked you here today. Where do you want to start? You were 11 years old? A Tutsi? You and your family sought shelter from the killings in the church of the Grey Fathers, the one run by Father Patenaude. Correct? So... ...wherever you want to start... What happened to you, Juliana? TRANSLATOR: I was born... ...in Sake. Beside the lake. I had one brother... ...and two sisters. My father was a farmer. Our field was our world. The sun shone, the water fell. The crops grew. Everything that came, also it would go. And then...it would come again. Until one day... ...the thing that came... ...it would never leave. (ROARING) That night... Iran ...to the lake... ...and hid amongst the reeds. And did you see Father Patenaude again? Yes. (RUNNING FOOTSTEPS) (FIRE CRACKLING) Thank you. Why ask me, when I cannot speak? Because words would fail. VOICE MAIL: Just leaving you a message, returning your call. It's not a problem but it's the only slot I have got so if you could give me a call to confirm, it would be great. José, 07700 900 864. (BEEPS) AUTOMATED MESSAGE: Next message. Message received today at 10.05am. VOICE MAIL: This is Mrs Beattie, Eve's sister. I'm hoping someone might be able to help me... (WATER LAPPING) MRS BEATTIE: So, what do we do? KATE: Throw them in. MRS BEATTIE: Is that what you did to her? - Yes. - Here? KATE: At low tide. MRS BEATTIE: Amongst all this... KATE: Life? Yes. MRS BEATTIE: It's a terrible thing to do to a human body. Why? Because we need our bodies for the resurrection. Oh. Really? Is that really right, Sorcha? So, which bit will, you know, say, Alfred the Great get to use? Because I'm guessing by now, most of him is part of the Winchester bypass. - Don't be cheap! - I'm not. I'm just being... ...factual. Where I come from, what you believe is who you are. If you don't believe, you're not complete. I think if you'd seen what your sister saw in Rwanda, you might think differently. It wasn't God's fault. You didn't see what happened in his churches. No. God's word is clear - “Thou shalt not kill." It's only when men fail to obey His word that these dreadful things happen. Men razed those churches, men killed your family. Not God - men. And those are the men Eve was prosecuting. Then she should have given herself up too. Why? What did she tell you about us? About what? Why we didn't speak. She'd lost her faith. Huh! Not it. Her accent, then. She was a bright girl, she got herself a scholarship. And she got out. No shame in that. Then in what? She had herself an abortion. Oh. You didn't know? - When? - I knew I shouldn't have come. - No, when, tell me when. - Before you. - And she...and she told you? - No. The doctors... She got an infection, and I was next of kin, seeing as how she wasn't married, an' all They wanted me to come, but I couldn't. Or wouldn't? She was your sister. And it was my niece she murdered. Oh...Sorcha... So there it is, then. Did you get my postal orders? - I sent one every Christmas. - Yes. Thank you. It wasn't about you, you know. If you were my kin, I would have loved you with all my heart. Iam. Oh, darling... ...you're not. Blood is blood. She murdered mine. I could never forgive her for it. She took it to her grave. And so will L (SHE SIGHS) (LOUD SPLASH) MICHAEL: You found it. Guess this must be how the Victorians felt. KATE: Before it all went to shit. Good weekend? I haven't stopped laughing. Me neither. This case... - ...better than a box set of Seinfeld. -Mm. - Can I ask you something? - Not about Seinfeld. Really funny one was the guy that came before. What was his name? Ran a chat show. Do you keep secrets? From who? From me. About what? Did you know Eve had a termination? When? Just before me. Yes, I did. Do you know why? Would you like me to guess? Uh... - Right relationship, wrong time. - With who? Ed Holt. When? Just after the genocide. They'd both gone to Rwanda, and it was all very unfortunate. I wouldn't have heard about it, but there were complications. She got very ill. Before me. Don't be thinking you were some kind of a guilt thing. Your mother would have taken you on no matter what. I'm sure of that. It just made you that much more special. Gerry... Gary... Fuck was his name? Why do you think she didn't tell me? Who did? Her sister. Oh! God's own Praetorian Guard, right? Nothing can happen if it's not in His name. Let me tell you something about her. During the Troubles, she had so many IRA guns under her bed it's a miracle she could walk in the morning. And when your mother became a prosecutor, the old Boys, they started to lean on her, to get her to help them out. As much as anything, that's why your mother never went back. And more than anything else, that's why her sister never forgave her. The termination was just the excuse. Sorcha Beattie was a nationalist down to her marrow. Once you know that, you know everything about her. And that's what we need to find out about this case. What this prosecution is really about. Cos that old monk, he's just the excuse. So...I got given this this morning. Who by? Couriered over to the office, PO box pick-up. I'm thinking it's your graveyard friend. - No. - Well, whoever it is, it's our second wish granted. So we'd better make it count. (CLOCK TICKING) (CLOCK CONTINUES TICKING) WOMAN: My mother. She's very beautiful. So I am forever told. And that's my brother. Oh! He's in the army. Was. Do you wonder why there is no picture of me? Because I'm not dead. My father only worships what he has lost. He'll see you now. (CLOCK CONTINUES TICKING) - JACQUES: I'm glad you came back. - KATE: Why? JACQUES: I wanted to apologise. Last time I think I may have seemed... ...insensitive to your personal tragedy. KATE: This isn't about me. Despite what happened to you, this is purely professional? I'm only here on behalf of Alice Munezero. To do what? Establish her innocence. Ah, yes, that's me, with Patrice Ganimana, taken in Rwanda about 27 years ago. A man accused of complicity to genocide. But at the time a serving officer in a legitimate government army. Which later went on to support a genocidal regime. - (SIGHS) We've had this conversation. - We have. And I'm not convinced by your argument. I didn't think this was about you. It's not. It's about him. Ah, yes. Tat Picot. You know him. Yes. How? when I was working for the Elysée, I was assigned a personal security agent. Him. You realise we can connect him to both key witnesses against Alice Munezero? I should imagine you can. Once we launched this case it was his job to extract them both - from Rwanda. - Why? - To protect them. - Who from? Anyone who didn't... ...doesnt want them to speak. I was attacked by him. Really? Mm. Why? Did you try and interfere with the witnesses? I spoke to them. But had they asked to speak to you? Then what do you expect? The Tutsi government of which your client is a part has a little black book. Did you know that? No. No, I didn't. And... ...anyone who speaks up against them will be on that list. I should imagine they're near the top. I know I am. And seeing as we are playing Top Trumps, I think I have a better card than you. (HE SIGHS) This is the world you're defending. Who took it? (TRANSLATED FROM FRENCH) - Personally? - Oui. When? Le 25 juin 1994. Er, in English, please, for the benefit of the defence. I took this photo on the 25th of June 1994. And... ...why were you in Rwanda at that time? My unit was part of Opération Turquoise, a humanitarian effort on behalf of the French army - to help bring the genocide to a close. - Well, that's contentious. Mademoiselle, please. I only wish to hear from the witness. Thank you. Continuez. Continue. We had heard there was a French national, Father Patenaude, - stranded in rebel territory. - Rebel terr...?! Again, I'm sorry, this is a very contentious comment. You are not free to cross-examine the witness. This is not - the UK here. - OK, OK. But please, just for the record, there is an argument that the true purpose of Operation Turquoise was to help perpetrators of the genocide escape in the face of an advancing Tutsi army, who was, of itself, singularly responsible for stopping the genocide. If you speak again, I will have you removed. Excusez-moi. I apologise. Continue. We took a helicopter and flew into the village where he was said to be. And...that is what we found. - Patenaude's remains. - Yes. Er... ...when was this? A week after Munezero's rebel army unit passed through the area. Alice Munezero. Yes. How can you be sure this is Patenaude's remains? - Apart from what you see? - Mm-hmm. The villagers confirmed it. - As they did the cause. - Which was? That he was shot in cold blood by Alice Munezero. And I say that with the full weight of my authority as a général de brigade. You've got to button up, Kate, that's the way they do things here. I know him. What? I've seen him before. Do you know Jacques Antoine Barré? The man who started this case. Non. No. But you do know his son. Pardon? He was in the army with you. I've seen a photograph of you together. I mean, you're younger, but, yes. It's definitely you. Non. - No. - It's not possible. Oh, but it is. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) (CLOCK TICKING) (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) And here you are again. Last time I was... (SIGHS) Last time I was here... ...there was a picture. You changed it. No. Mm. You changed it. No. SHOUTS: Yes! Because I'm right! This is perverting the course of justice. Only in your mind. You are clearly very disturbed. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I go that way whenever I'm sensing a lie, and this one is so fucking big, I'm surprised I'm not bouncing off the fucking panelling! I think you should leave now. (CLOCK CONTINUES TICKING) You. KATE: Oh, and by the way... ...thank you for the swimming lesson. My breaststroke is coming on a treat. - You're welcome. - Oh! No, no, no. Forgot to sign in. How rude. Forgive me. (PEN SCRIBBLING) Thank you. It's me. I've got it. Sophie Barré, his daughter, gave it to us. And now... ...I'm going to flush out that fucking priest. (ALARM BLARES) What are you doing? What does it look like? (ALARM STOPS) (TRANSLATED FROM FRENCH) OK. (TRANSLATED FROM FRENCH) - They won't speak to you. - It's OK. I just needed them to listen. ABBOT: Allez. (TRANSLATED FROM FRENCH) (SCRUBBING) (BELL CHIMES) (GRUNTS) (BELL CHIMES) Frank! I told you not to come. Why not? I'm not on the indictment. You get a parking ticket, and they will blame me. You don't trust me to behave. I just don't want you to be compromised. I couldn't let you go through all this on your own. Iam not on my own. Not any more, you're not. Cos now Frankie's here. (HE LAUGHS) Hello, Frank. - Michael. - Everything OK? Ah... ...apart from having a wife on the front page of every paper I pick up... (LAUGHS) If I wasn't such a big man, it might have shrunk my Johnson. (LAUGHS) How are things back home? You've got to see it to believe it. In Kigali, there are 1,000 people outside the embassy, at least, night and day. All chanting for your release, all carrying your picture. You're a superstar, baby. They love you, Alice. Could have been anyone. Ah, but it was you. You chose to make the stand. I may still lose. Oh, you've got the love of your country. You'll never lose that. I mean, I had someone come in and see me last week, offered me the keys to a brand-new Land Rover, just to get a shot of you driving it. (LAUGHS) You did not accept it. No... No! Of course not! Of course I didn't! But...you've become one powerful lady, baby. Mm? One powerful lady. (FRANK SIGHS) - How's Hana, Mikey? - The same. She'll stay that way now. At least, that's what the doctors say. - Oh. - She's still in there, so... ...it's not over yet. Everybody at the bank misses her. Sends their best. Thank you. still... ...you know... You did everything you could. It wasn't enough. You got her back home. There's nothing else you could have done. Now, let's try and do the same for your wife. (INDISTINCT METRO ANNOUNCEMENTS) (MUSIC AND CHEERING ON TV) (ANNOUNCEMENT ON TV) Garry Shandling. Oh, fuck. - Ah, here we go. - (CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS) (CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS) Got him. (DOORBELL RINGS) (DOORBELL RINGS) Bonjour, Maman. (UNHOOKS CHAIN) (PHONE RINGS) Come on, Michael. (PHONE RINGS) (TV IN BACKGROUND) (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ON TV) What to do, what to do, what to do. MAN: Well, nothing. You got the shot you need. Just pick him up tomorrow. He's leaving. Oh, hello. What? Tat Picot? Shit! Hey! (RUNNING FOOTSTEPS) Fancy that. - You can't take that train. - Oh, yeah? This little macaque is going to stop me? No - this one is. (KNIFE SCRAPES) (THEY GRUNT) I watch her, I watch him. And if I see anything happen to either of them, you will not see the end of that day. You should go to the hospital now. - Why? - Because when you are a genocide denier, you do not see straight. (PICOT SCREAMS, YELLS IN AGONY) You should catch that train. Now! Aidez-moi! Aidez-moi! Cet homme est blessé! Cet homme est blessé! (SHOUTS OF PAIN CONTINUE) (SHOUTS OF PAIN ECHO) (SCREAM ECHOES) MICHAEL: On the left of this photo is Alexandre Lesage, taken 25 years ago, when he wasn't a general. The man in the centre is Clément Barré, the son of the man who initiated this whole prosecution, Jacques Antoine Barré. So? When asked, Monsieur Lesage said he'd never met Clément. Clearly that's not true. You're trying to establish the witness as unreliable? I think I can go further than that. Are you OK? (INHALES) Never better. So... (CLEARS THROAT) ...I had the military record of Clément Barré checked. He was a lieutenant in a French marine parachute regiment. Records show he was killed during a training exercise in the Central African Republic in March of 1993. But the thing is, that can't be true. You see, a month before, Monsieur Lesage was made up to a captain. That's the rank he's wearing in the photo. But he was only made it specifically to lead a small group of paratroopers on a special operation into Rwanda. In February 1993. Over a year before the genocide. Their mission was to train troops for the Rwandan government, the Hutus, to resist the advancing Tutsi army. The army in which Alice Munezero was serving. But Lesage and Clément and the unit were under strict instructions not to fire any of the weapons themselves. Except... ...for some reason, Clément Barré was killed. But officially, that never could have happened, because if it had, it would have exposed the fact that the French military - in effect, the French president - was standing shoulder to shoulder with what would turn out to be a genocidal regime. So Clément Barré's death was covered up, and Brigadier General Lesage had to have been a part of that. That's what the photo shows. (SIGHS) But... ...even if all this could be corroborated, none of it undermines the central accusation levelled against your client. Namely, she murdered a French national the following year. Except she didn't. (TRANSLATED FROM FRENCH)
