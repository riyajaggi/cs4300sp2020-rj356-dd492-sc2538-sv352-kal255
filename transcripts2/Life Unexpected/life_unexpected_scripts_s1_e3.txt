 When Baze tells his parents about Lux (Britt Robertson), they insist on planning a dinner at which they can meet their granddaughter and Cate. Cate reluctantly agrees to go to the dinner and is further annoyed when her overbearing mother and neurotic sister show up unexpectedly. Meanwhile, when Cate hears about a gang fight at Lux's school, she immediately decides to have Lux transferred to her and Baze's alma mater, Westmonte.

 You gave up that kid. I am that kid. And now I'm applying for emancipation. Um, Cate Cassidy-- that's your mom. I am Cate Cassidy. Ryan and I have been up since 5:00. And as usual, arguing since 6:00. What are you doing? Will you marry me? Cate... meet Lux, our daughter. You never even told me I've got a kid out there! Why would I?! You wouldn't even admit that she existed! I am not granting you emancipation.

 I'm releasing you back into their temporary joint custody. Coffee, two sugars. Blueberry waffle, lightly toasted. Mm, thank you. Good morning, Portland. It is 7:00 a.m., and you are listening to Morning Madness with Cate and Ryan. It's the morning after Cate's big announcement. For those of you who missed it, a quick recap may be in order. Real quick. Cate adds one more impressive role to her ever-expanding resume.

 Some may call her "emotionally crippled, commitment-phobic," but there is one lucky person out there who now calls her-- now wait for it, people-- "Mom." Thanks, Ryan. You ever think you'll start calling me "Dad"? Yeah. Dads are meaner, tougher, hairier. And thank you, Portland. Um, the phone lines have been lighting up. I have been inundated with... with e-mails, advice, encouragement... you know, even gifts. Dude, watch it! God! Hey, are you okay? Yeah. Who are those guys? Some bags from juvie. Tasha, Baze. Baze, Tasha. Hi. Cute. Tasha likes older guys. Older, not ancient. He's, like, 30. Wow, thank you for that. Hey, where's it at? Uh, do you want me to walk you in? Is everything cool? Ah, don't worry about it. If the state prison had a feeder school, this would be it. Come on, man. Hey, hey, give it up, man. Okay. Later. Peace. Later. It's parenting, okay? I mean, how hard is it gonna be? Every dummy out there is doing it. Hey, we've got Abby on the line. Abby, long time, no talk. It is Crazy Abby, everyone. Uh, where have you been? Uh, out of town too long, apparently. God, Cate, you must be the most narcissistic, self-involved, selfish person I know. I go on a spiritual retreat to cleanse my soul, curb my emotional eating, and this is what I come home to? Your kid jus t-just reappears out of nowhere. Have you told Mom yet? It's so nice to hear from you, Abby. I mean, what judge in their right mind would give you custody of a kid? Actually, you want to make that joint custody. With Dewey Johnson? The wasp. Who? What wasp? What? No one. Um, it was this, like, really rich guy. No, our school mascot, AKA the dad. How do you not know this? Well, unless Dewey Johnson's name is really Nate Bazile, I don't. And we have got Donna on the line. Donna, how you doing today? Don...? Wait a minute. Quarterback, popular, hot Nate Bazile? Cate, I loved Nate Bazile! You had sex with Nate Bazile? You and Nate Bazile have a kid together? I can't believe... Okay! What are you doing? What? Me? What do you mean? Yeah. Why-Why don't you ask Abby? She's the therapist. God, no matter... no matter how many times I say that, it never gets less terrifying. Really? I'm getting coffee. No, Cate, come on. All right, look, just... What? Let me get this straight. So you-you slept with a guy that your little sister had a thing for? Everyone had a thing for him. It's not exactly like she's some special case. And even so, it doesn't give her the right to call in and say that I'm some selfish parent. I mean, come on. I've had Lux one week. What haven't I done? I've dressed her, I've fed her, I've watered her, I... Hey, doesn't Lux go to Longfellow? Yeah, why? It's shut down. It's on the local AP here. Oh, my God. A gang fight? Do you have any idea where Lux is right now? Okay, um, just... will you cover for me? Tell Jenny it's an emergency. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Open Bar. Oh, my God, thank God you're there. We need to get you a cell phone. I heard what happened. I tried the school. I called Baze. I left him a zillion messages. He never called me back. Cate, it's fine. Baze picked me up. This kind of thing happens all the time. I guess this time there was just more blood. Yeah, we're closed. Look, I need to talk to you about something, okay? Uh, can I call you right back? Yeah, but just hurry. Oh, Ms. Merman, hi! Oh, my God, it's been forever. I was actually, um, just coming into the main office to talk to you. Oh, I'm Cate Cassidy, Class of '94. Valedictorian. Oh, Abby's sister. Or that. Yeah, um, I'm actually here to enroll a new student to start tomorrow... Well, sure. Come on. Oh, great. Uh, stare much? Sorry. I'm looking for Nate Bazile. He's not here. He's out doing laundry. Hmm. That wasn't a euphemism. I didn't get your name. I didn't give it to you. My parents said that I shouldn't speak to strangers. Can you let him know I came by? Sure. You got a name? I'm his father. What do you eat over there in that loft of yours? It seems every time you come over, you've been starving for days. I store it up, like a food camel. Oh, I hear your dad. You know what? I got to go. What? Thank you. Oh, well, here. Wait... Hey, Dad. You leaving? So soon? Yeah, the bar. I got to... I got to work tonight, so... Nothing you want to mention first? The rent for the bar. Okay. Oh. Dad, I know I'm late this month, but I will get you the money... I was talking about your daughter. What? Tell your mother, Nate, about the girl you got pregnant in high school. I'm still a little fuzzy. My secretary didn't quite get all the details of what was said on the radio this morning. Okay, you got to understand, I was gonna tell you... You have a daughter? Yeah. We have a granddaughter? Do we know the mother? Cate. Cate Cassidy. How did that happen? Well, you know, the-the normal way. And, uh... you just found out about this? Lux-- she just showed up at my doorstep last week. That-That's her name-- Lux. Wait a minute. Let me get this straight. You never knew that Cate was pregnant? Uh... no. No, she never told me. But hey, you guys always said you wanted grandkids, so there's that. You think this is funny, huh? You can't handle paying rent. How are you going to handle having a kid? Okay. Like everybody else doe s- I'll figure it out. I need to meet these people-- Lux, Cate-- find out what's really going on. We'll have dinner tomorrow night. Oh, that's not a good idea at all. You pull a stunt like this, you lose the privilege of having an opinion. If we' gonna bail you out, I need to know how deep the mess is. I never asked you to bail me out. You're not asking me to pay your rent, either, but I'm doing it. Would you give me a break? It is a brand-new business. I'm just starting it up. You take the building I give you, and you turn it into a bar? I like it. Here's a fact. You act like a kid, we'll treat you like one. So come to dinner, or I'll take back the bar. Your choice. Sync by honeybunny www.addic7ed.com I don't get it. How could you just transfer me to Westmonte just like that? How? Um, well, because it's my alma mater. I have connections, so... We also live in the district. I meant, without even asking me. Okay, look, I know that it's scary to think of a new school and new friends... I don't care about new friends. I care about Natasha. I know you do, but there really was not much of a choice. I promise you, I am just looking out for your best interests. My best interests are to be with Natasha. I'm the only reason she even goes to school. It's the only time I get to see her, now that she's at Sunnyvale and I'm across town. I know. I know. See? That-- ooh-- that is why I got you this. Now, the two of you, you guys can keep in touch. Not really. She used to have Gavin's cell, but now she has to use the payphone at Sunnyvale if she wants to talk. Okay, well, then, it's... It's not just for Natasha. It's for us, too. That way, we can, you know, text during the day, and I've already programmed my number in here and Ryan's. Baze's. I'll be in the attic. But thanks. God, high school. It's like your whole life is ahead of you. And there's the band room. My classroom's right past that. What am I going to get Jones? I can't show up empty-handed. Brynn, just relax. The party's, like, two weeks away and he's going to be... And that's the main office. You can grab your schedule there. Hey, Mr. Rogers still in guidance? Maybe he can give me some free career counseling. He's dead. Wait. Wait. Is that... Is that you? Yeah. 1993 city champs. That was a great game. He called the QB sneak to win. I had a guy mashing his cleat in my ear. I'm gonna go grab my schedule. Oh, your dad would go on about that play. Yeah, he was actually proud of me back then. God, what the hell happened? Besides hearing you have a kid on the radio? No wonder he's pissed. No. He was pissed before that. Look, if Lux is what pushed him over the edge enough to threaten to take the bar back, do something to fix it. That's a great idea, Doc. Why don't you fire up the DeLorean, I'll grab the condoms, and we will head back to the 90s. All right, funny guy. Then bail on the dinner. Yeah, I would if I could. But I can't. Right. So make the most of it. Go over there with Cate and Lux. He'll see you're getting your life back in order, taking care of your responsibilities, stepping up and doing the right thing. The rent isn't his issue. He'll cut you a break. Just show him you're trying to be a good dad. He wants to be proud of you again. Just... give him a reason to be. So, you good? You all set? Know where you're going? You, uh, want me to introduce you around? Uh... Or not. It's fine. I-I got it from here, really. Yeah, no. It was hideous. Don't even pretend like it wasn't. Hey, Brynn. What's up? Uh, hey. So, are you guys going to that party or what? You mean Jones's? Yeah. Who else? Actually, Brynn was just stressing out about what to get him. Well, just 'cause his birthday's our three-month anniversary. I need, like, a double gift. Oh. Well, you know, Jones is a tough one. He's-He's practical, but sentimental deep down. So, you're friends with Jones? Not, like, with benefits or anything. You know, I-I think we've met once before. A while ago. Like, a movie theater, bowling alley... Ice rink? Well, I used to take skating lessons. Yes. That was it. Oh, yeah. Me, too. You weren't there. Anyway, so, I've been at boarding school in California. I got kicked out for doing it with my boyfriend on the lab table. Wait, seriously? Oh, I'm sorry. I don't remember anyone asking to hear about your life story. I'm going outside. Come on. She's kind of a bitch. Thanks. Hello? BAZE : Finally. Geez. I've left you, like, 20 messages. Yeah. Well, now you know how it feels. Hey, I see you. What are you doing here? I'm signing up for cheerleading. What do you think I'm doing here? I'm picking up Lux. No. I wanted to pick her up today. Nuh-uh. School's my gig. Listen, we have to have dinner tonight. That's why I was calling. At my parents' house. You, me and Lux. Yeah. No. Come on, Cate. No, I'm sorry. You should've asked me earlier. Well, I was trying, but I was too busy getting reamed out from my father. Turns out he heard what your dumb fiancÃƒÂ© said on the radio. Oh, well, my dumb fiancÃƒÂ© and I are having dinner with Lux. Next time, give me a heads up. Oh, okay. Like the heads up you gave me when you yanked her out of Longfellow and enrolled her here? Yeah. To get her away from criminals and gang members. People like that. ("Yeah Alright" by Richmond Sluts playing ("Yeah Alright" by Richmond Sluts playing Hey. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Get your lips off of her! You with the bike! Back away from the girl! Are these your parents? Let's say no. Yes. I am her dad. So back it up, little dude. Baze, relax. We were just hanging out. Just "hanging out"? That's how you hang out? You let some random guy suffocate you with his mouth? He's not some random guy. Wait, wait. I'm sorry. Wait. What? Is this Bug? The boyfriend? Yes. Wait. You knew about this? No. Only that his name was Bug. Okay. A guy named Bug didn't raise some concerns? No offense, pal. Nobody needs to be concerned. Okay, he just came to pick me up. We're going to go hang out, grab some dinner. I'll have her home by 10:00. I am making dinner tonight for your first day at Westmonte. What about my dinner? Uh-uh, I have spent the entire day on Epicurious. I have been to three different grocery stores. I'm knee-deep in ingredients. Okay, come on, let's go, we're having dinner like I planned. Okay, what am I supposed to do about my parents? Bring Bug. Ooh. Okay, so Bug following us back here-- that's not what I had in mind. What's going on here? Lux! Did that guy have a spider web on his neck? I didn't think this through. Yeah, maybe we shouldn't have given her the attic. Cate? You here? Neither was forgetting to lock the front door. Hey, uh... Ryan. This isn't the way it's supposed to be. Cate just telling you what to do and you doing it? 'Cause why? You've been on your own your whole life. You've grown up, you've taken care of yourself. I mean, I know you always wondered who they were, and now you know. Maybe that's all it's supposed to be. So Natasha called me; she brought up Mexico again. Natasha and Mexico. She loves the idea-- the four of us on a beach sipping piÃƒÂ±a coladas. She's never even had a piÃƒÂ±a colada, and the only Spanish word she knows is "nachos." Okay, fine, so it doesn't have to be Mexico. L.A., Vegas, Seattle. We go somewhere where no one'll find you guys till you're 18. You and Gavin would really leave Portland for us? If it meant no more foster care, no more group homes, social services, yeah. Where's the three grand you saved, the money to get emancipated? My life savings? Well, I have it, but... it's not enough for the four of us to live on. Yeah, but Gavin-- he's got some cash. I got leads on some quick money. Seriously, all we need is the cash to get there. We'll pawn stuff if we have to. Stuff like what? There's tons of junk in this house no one would miss, stuff like this. No, that's from Baze. That actually, like, means something to me. Okay, so something else. Let's just do what it takes so we can be together, okay? Or... we can just be together now. Would you hear me out for two seconds? Why, why? So you can talk me into going to dinner at your parents' house tonight? You know, and I'm gonna set myself up to be, you know, ripped apart and criticized-- thank yo u- by a couple of judgmental, elitist snobs like your parents, who think they're better than everyone else. So w-wait, you've met them? No, but I know their type. You are their type. You just described you. Ryan, how do you, how do you date her without killing her? Is something burning? Oh, my God. God. You see? It's a sign. Does "no means no" mean anything to you? Look, Cate, my dad is pissed, and if I don't show up tonight, he is going to take back the bar. I didn't make rent, he found out about Lux-- hey, thanks for that-- and he thinks that we can't handle a kid. We? How did we become a "we"? And since when do your parents, who know nothing about me, have an opinion on whether or not I can handle a kid? Cate, I think you should go. Hmm? No, I mean, Lux deserves to know her grandparents, whether she wants to or not. Thank you. The voice of reason. And I'm sure Baze's parents want to meet you, too, now that they know what you've gone through with absolutely no help from their son. Thanks. Besides, if you stick around here, you're just going to be worrying about what's going on in the, uh... attic. Uh... wait, what is going on up in the attic? BAZE: Lux, we're leaving! We're going to Baze's, after all! Lux? Can I bring Bug? CATE AND BAZE: No! So, is this being a good parent? What, ripping you out of the clutches of some tattooed freak? I don't know, is it? Yes, it is. Making me do things that I don't want to do with people that I don't even want to meet without the one person who could have made it better. Okay, the point is to make a good impression, and... bringing Bug, it would have just been an... an impression. And what is wearing a prom dress? What? I'm sor-- wait, what, is this too much? No. Is it? No. Oh, my gosh. You must be Lux. Oh, you're gorgeous. Oh, my God, just look at you. Oh, God, I can't believe how much you look like Nate, and you have my hair. Um, Mom, this is Cate. Nice to meet you. Hi, and you. Oh, good, here they are. Oh, sorry, Costco was a zoo, but we got the wine! Oh, my God. Who are those people? Hi! My family. Oh, it's like looking in the mirror. Hi. Hi, I'm Ellen. How you doing? Oh! Oh, you must be, um... Hi, I'm Laverne. Hi, Laverne. Well, come on in. Come on, I want to show you around, sweetie. Okay, okay, so, um, what are you two doing here? Uh, Baze's mom invited us, which is more than I can say for you. Hi! Hey, it's been, what? Hey. It's been like forever. Oh, um, Annie, right? No, it's Abby. Oh, sorry. Um... Yeah. Do you know what a sense of relief I have? I know. Mom, I know, Lux, she's a great kid... But honey, not just that. All these years I thought you lost your virginity to that giant wasp. But the quarterback? I mean... You know, he's single, right? Okay, no, Mom. Mom, Mom, look, you are here to meet your granddaughter. So, can you please, please, please keep the trolling to a minimum? Yeah, yeah, that would be... that would be really messy if Baze was my high school crush, your baby daddy and mom's fifth husband. All right, come on, you guy... I was aski for you, sweetheart. For heaven's sakes, give me a little credit. I still can't believe that you slept with Baze behind my back. Okay, I'm sorry. Did we just witness the same moment? Because he doesn't even know who you are. Uh, he was being discreet. Uh, and here's the other woman of the hour. They call her the Voice of Portland. And actually, Lux, uh, grew up listening to Cate on the radio. Right, um... Lux, why don't you tell everyone how you grew up listening? I grew up listening. That's so sweet! I never do. You are so teeny. I just want to put you in my pocket. I can take over. Thanks, honey. Yep. Actually, I prefer radio shows with a stronger emphasis on good moral s-- values, you know-- like being upfront when other people's lives are at stake. So, Baze, you own a bar? He doesn't own anything. Um... Dad, I said I was going to get you the rent. I won't hold my breath. If you don't have $3,200 today, you're not gonna have it tomorrow. You know, I haven't had the chance to tell you this yet, but, uh, Lux is going to Westmonte. Yeah, we enrolled her yesterday, didn't we? Yes, we did. Well, how do you like it? You made any new friends? Well, I already had friends. But Cate doesn't want me to see them. So... Um, you know what? We, um... We... will you excuse us for a second? We're gonna go have a little family pow-wow, 'cause, you know, like, families, it's what we do. Okay, team, we are here to make a good first impression. So, let's focus up and save the cat fights for later, okay? Mm-hmm, I just, I don't know even know what I've done that's so wrong. What, is it that I got you into a good school, or I didn't let you dry hump, you know, um, spider neck guy? I was at a school that I was perfectly happy with. I have a boyfriend that I love. I've spent my whole life in foster care where no one has given a crap about what I wanted. So, I guess I just pictured that if I ever got a mom she actually would. But you don't. I'm not you, okay? I don't want what you want. You want me to sit at this dinner and pretend like these people are my family? They're not. You're not. I'm sensing some tension here. As a trained professional, would you mind if I...? Oh, my God. So, we-we've come together as your families to intervene. What? Intervene with what? We-We just want to talk calmly and rationally about what's best for Lux. Hmm... You two are-are... are morons if you think that you can raise a kid. I think what Abby is trying to say is that we have some concerns. The two of you are, you're not ready to be parents. Oh, my God. This should be really good, coming from the woman that's on her, what, fourth husband? So, I've learned to take life's lemons and make lemonade. Mm-hmm, with vodka. Look, look, you two... you screwed up big-time. But the way to rectify it isn't to dig in deeper. This is a kid's life we're talking about. Would anyone like anything? Water? You can never over-hydrate. Lux needs a family. Or at the very least someone who is qualified to care for her. Yeah, we know. We're the someones. No, no, you have no concept of what it takes to be a parent. And-And you insisting on this makes absolutely no sense. We're just wondering if you've explored all of your options. There are no other options, that's the point. If there were, do you think a judge would've given her to us? Cate, come on. You leave for work at the crack of dawn. Y-You're out at events every night. Plenty of people do it. I'm just saying, you know, there's... there's plenty of people here to help, you know? People more capable of raising a child. You? I mean, are you... are you seriously proposing that you take her? I don't think anyone's suggesting that. Actually, I was. If your daughter's any reflection of your parenting skills, I don't think I'd be comfortable with that. And your parental skills are so stellar? Have you met your son? It's abundantly clear that Ellen and I are the only people in this room qualified to parent anyone. You two are whack jobs. My son, well, that goes without saying. And you, you never told him that, uh, that you were carrying his kid. Instead, you just gave her away. Are you kidding me? Who-Who knows who he would be today if he'd just known? Huh? Stop, Dad. I knew. When you asked me yesterday if I knew she was pregnant, I knew, I lied. Okay, I knew she was pregnant, and I knew it was mine. So, you haven't grown up, huh? You haven't changed. You know what, Nate? You can kiss the bar good-bye. I'm done. You know what? What? I'm done. You can take your bar, because I am done with you, and I am done with all of this. Sixteen years ago, I was afraid to tell you. And you know, it seems funny, given everything, because I didn't wanna disappoint you and let you down. But somehow I have managed to do that every day since. You were never going to believe that I was responsible. You were never gonna believe in me. So, I don't, I don't know why I agreed to this dinner. Oh, no, I do know why. It's because you threatened to take away the one means I have of actually supporting my kid. Because that's what I'm trying to do here, Dad-- whether you believe it or no t- is support my kid. Because that's what I thought parents did. I supported you every day of your life. Not in the way that counts. You call me crazy, but I thought tha t-that loving your kid meant that you actually made them feel like you did. You know what? You ask me why I want to do this, why I want to be a dad? It's because I don't wanna turn my back on Lux the way that you... The way, what, huh? Come on, say it, Nate. Like I did to you? That's the story you tell yourself? To keep from thinking that you're a screw-up... you blame me?! Wait, where's Lux? So, this is great. Our teenage daughter just drove off on the back of her boyfriend's motorbike. Yeah, we thought the attic was bad. Yeah. Screw 'em. You know what? Just screw all of them. I mean, you know, if they had done a better job raising us, we would be better qualified to raise Lux. So, really, if you think about it, this whole thing, it's their fault. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. And kind of mine. I shouldn't have enrolled her in that place without talking to you. I just read that article, and I pictured her in that school, and... I really just wanna make every bad thing go away. But it just seems like the more I try, the worse it's getting. Maybe that's the problem. Not everything in her life was bad. Like... I don't like the looks of him, but Bug, Natasha... What? I don't know. To Lux, they're the good. I mean, if you... if you think about it, we both had families before Lux. So, maybe she just wants you to realize that she had a family before us. Pretty insightful, for a quarterback. Thanks. I don't know what's worse. Having foster parents that treat you like crap or having your own treat you that way. Maybe we've been the lucky ones. Maybe. That it? That's all of it? Yeah. You think I'm doing the right thing? Yeah. Me, too. All right, you should go before Cate gets home. You gonna tell her? No. Just pick me up in the morning, okay? Lux! So, you... you got it? The perfect gift? Jones is gonna love it. How much? Well, it's a collector's item. Belonged to Jerry Garcia when it was just a bong, not a lamp. It's worth, like, a thousand bucks. But I could give you a good deal. You know, as a friend. Well, 200's all I got. Two hundred? Yeah, that's perfect. Cool. Here. Take care of it. Okay. Well, thanks. See ya! Hey. Hey. What's this? It's what's most important, right? $3,200 cash, rent for the bar? From Baze. What, did he rob a bank or something? I'm no expert on parents, but I always thought they just wanted their kids to be happy. I do want my son to be happy. You want your son to be you. You're not mad at Baze because... because he... he made the building a bar or because he can't pay his rent or even because he had me and didn't tell you. You're mad because... ...because he looked at you and decided that he didn't want to be you. Now, I've only known you for a few minutes, and I've known Baze for less than two weeks, but I know that he's twice the dad that you are. Hey. What are you doing here? I'm just looking around. You know what, this place is going to be yours soon enough, all right? Yeah? Well... not this month, at least. I don't know how you came up with the rent money that fast. You hit Cate up? Lux... she came by and gave me the $3, 200 this morning. You must, uh, really trust her-- to deliver that kind of money. Yeah. I mean, of... of course I do. So, the bar-- hang on to it. As long as you can keep the rent up, it's yours. And tell your daughter that she's welcome to come by the house anytime she wants. Yeah, I'll tell her. Hey. Hey. So, I got a parenting book. Yeah, it's pretty helpful. Well, except there's not a chapter on what to do when your boozehound mom shows up and wants to take your kid. Yeah. So, I figured apologizing would probably just be easier. Lux, I am sorry that I have gone about this mom thing all wrong. Okay, from... from now on, um... ...any decision that we make, it is going to be a group process. It's going to be you and me and Ryan and Baze. Kind of like a family. Yeah. And I'm sorry for not accepting yours. Okay, the jury's unanimous. I suck at this mother thing. Well, maybe I suck at this daughter thing. I'm used to people telling me what to do. I'm just not used to caring enough to listen. Okay. Um... I know this is going to sound a little bit crazy, but I'm thinking that we should do another family dinner. No, no. No, no, no. No, no. Not with my family. Don't worry. This time, with yours. We could have Tasha and Bug and whoever else you want to have over, and I can cook. I can order in. Actually... I think I have a better idea. If you're up for it. Where are we? On the top of Bug's apartment. This is where I was going to live. Hey, um... I know what you di d- paying my rent-- and-and I'm going to pay you back every penny. Listen... you're the kid now. You don't have to take care of me. I know. I was just trying to support you. That's what you said parents are supposed to do, right? Well... I don't know.
