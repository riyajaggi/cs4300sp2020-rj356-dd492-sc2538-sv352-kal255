 After learning that Tasha may have to move three hours away to a new foster home, Lux decides to help her find her mother who is still in Portland. Baze and Ryan compete in a radio station contest as Cate worries about whether she should tell Ryan the whole truth about sleeping with Baze. After Tasha's mother rejects her, Lux asks Cate to take Tasha in, but she refuses.

 Ryan and I have been up since 5:00. And, as usual, arguing since 6:00. You have met the qualifications as foster parents and will be granted temporary joint custody of Lux. Cate, you will be Lux's primary caregiver. That means that Lux is only allowed to live at Cate's. Oh, my God, tell me this didn't happen. It happened twice. CATE: He kissed me. Baze did. Did you sleep with him? I did not sleep with him.

 Of course I didn't sleep with him. Ryan wants less of you in our lives. So do I. CATE: Okay, okay, "Look Away" by Chicago- best break-up song ever. RYAN (over radio): "Take These Broken Wings"- Mr. Mister- that's, that's a break-up song. CATE: Oh, no, no, no, I will see your Mr. Mister, and I, I will raise you Roxette- "It Must Have Been Love." RYAN: If you're a 14-year-old girl in the '80s. CATE: Breakups turn us all into 14-year-old girls in the '80s. âª With an aching in my head, I lay motionless... âª

 RYAN: Well, personally, I like to focus on the positive side of breakups. Wearing your sweatpants all day and eating your weight in ice cream? Rebound sex. Wow, life gives you lemons, you make skank-ade. Uh, and when we get back, get your dialing fingers ready because we will be selecting the 19th contestant for this weekend's "Hands on a Hybrid" contest. Oh, and if you're still not sure what the hell that means, stay tuned. âª And slept right through the dawn âª âª And the world... âª (groans) Here. This will help. I promise. Rocky Road? It's a metaphor... that you can eat. âª I watch the stars âª âª From my windowsill... âª Bug's gone, and I'm the one who drove him away. He drove himself away... on his motorcycle after you asked him to treat you better. It's all just kind of a blur. That's what breakups do. They confuse things. They make you doubt yourself and get back in bed in the middle of the day. That is why you need this. Hmm? Retail therapy. Hmm, I guess some arm warmers could take the edge off. Exactly. Cate. Boyfriend leaving aside... this has all been pretty great lately. Thanks. Of course. âª And where you'd gone, and the world... âª A- And you probably know this by now- I mean, if you don't, you should. Whatever you need, I'm here. âª And the world spins madly on. âª TASHA: Cate Cassidy, the perfect mom. You're bummed and she gives you cash for clothes. What happens when you get a case of the frownies? Is she going to buy you a pony? Bet you won't be complaining when Cate's cash buys you a scarf. Or that. Some prospective foster parents are coming to meet me tonight. Last thing I want is to get picked by two flakes just looking for someone to baby-sit their other kids. Then get it. Nothing says "low-maintenance, lovable teen with no issues" like a dress with metal studs. It looks expensive. Don't. Why not? We used to do it all the time. What, are you, like, above it now? I'll wait here. You'll need someone to be your one phone call when you get arrested. Wimp. (bell jingling) (indistinct chattering) (laughter) (knocking) BAZE: Lux! Anybody home? Cate? What is he doing here? Hey, I can see you guys. Okay, don't say anything. About him trying to kiss you? Yeah. It happened. We're past it. There's no need to stir things up. It's open! Please. Hey, hey. Little grocery shopping? How observant. What are you doing here? I was gonna see if Lux wanted to grab a bite, maybe hit the arcade. Whack-A-Mole does wonders for a break-up. She's not here. She's shopping with Tasha. Oh, I can wait. Well, that's probably not a good idea. What, you got big plans? You gonna bore her to death? Actually, I'm taking her driving. Wait. Don't you think that's more of a dad type duty? Well, when she's here, I kind of fill that role. I'm sorry. What? You heard me. Okay. Why don't you just come back tomorrow? Uh, you guys can whack moles then. Because right now we're sort of in the middle of a whole family thing, so... Yeah. Don't let me intrude on a family thing. Nerve of that guy. Okay, just let it go. Look, he got a pass today. Next time, I say something. (no audio) (door opening) Oh, I love shopping. Why is your face all scrunched? Nothing. Let's get out of here. I mean, I'm not wrong, am I? Driving lessons are a rite of passage for a dad. No, you're not wrong. Seriously, that's your best move? And then the guy basically runs me out of the house. Are you sure that's what he did? You're not exaggerating just a little? Get him. Get him. Get him. Get him. Get him. Damn it! You know what it is? This controller's broken. You want to switch controllers? Because I'll switch controllers. Okay, I need you two to listen. I actually have a legit problem here. Cate and Ryan want less of me in their lives, but the only way I get to be with Lux is to be over there. How am I supposed to be a good dad if I can't even get any time with her? Okay, let me drop some knowledge on you. Ryan is like the new silverback in the jungle. Like the gorilla? Yeah. Primal dynamics. He sets up shop, moves in against the females, and asserts his dominance over the chump gorilla. That's you. No, it's not. What are you talking about? You're not even making sense. Okay, before you know it, you're on the outs, picking out your own fleas, looking in on their banana party. Maybe Ryan's just trying to be helpful. Yeah, I'm sure that's what the chump gorilla thought, too. Ryan is moving in on his dad role. He's already giving Lux driving lessons. What's next? Parent-Teacher Night? Dropping her off at college? He's walking her down the aisle? Jamie's right. I'm the chump gorilla. I got to out-gorilla him. I got to stand up, beat my chest, and wreck his banana party. Or you could just talk to him. No, man, no. I cannot just sit back and watch this guy replace me, that is for sure. I'm gonna teach this guy that Lux has one dad. And that's me. Transcript by Addic7ed.com And now, we're back with Cate and Ryan. Good morning, Portland. We're so glad that you could be joining us on this Friday morning. Especially since today is the last day to win the last spot in K-100's "Hands on a Hybrid" competition. Now, for those of you who are unfamiliar, this is a contest where 20 K-100 fans engage in a battle of will to win a top-of-the-line hybrid by keeping one hand on the car for as long as possible. Final hand on the car wins. Now, last year's contest set a record 39 hours. We have 19 contestants lined up already. Plus me, your favorite radio host and incidentally, last year's champion. Wow, it suddenly got really cramped here in the booth with me, Ryan, and Ryan's humongous ego. Come on! Come on, if I win, the car goes to charity. Oh, right, correction: Ryan's charitable ego. So, be the 100th caller right now for your chance to win a car. Or, you know, as I like to think of it: beating Ryan. What will Cate and Ryan say next? (phone ringing) What? You tell your hotshot fiancÃ© that starting this afternoon, I'll be giving Lux driving lessons. And if there's any other dad stuff to be done, I'll be the one doing it. That's what I'm talking about. Okay, I'm at work right now. Let's talk about Lux later, all right? Is that Baze? Not anymore. Dude, she just hung up on me. Call her back. I'll call her back. Hey, it's Cate. Leave a message. She just turned off her phone. Call the station. I'm calling the station. (busy tone beeping) It's busy. Keep dialing. Come on. Tash? What are you doing here? That family wants me from last night. The foster family. Okay, what's it this time? Eight kids, want a live-in maid? Or they just want the government check? They're three hours away. I'd live three hours away. Wait. What? I told my case worker... You can't go that far. We've never been that far. She said I didn't have a choice. How soon are they coming? I've got two days. Well, you have to get out of it. We have to find someone else. Lux, you know how it is. Once you're assigned to a foster home, you're gone. You're going to think I'm crazy. I think I saw your mom. What? Yesterday. Outside that store. Where you stole the dress. There's no way. Last time I talked to my mom, she bailed on rehab and was serving out a two-year sentence for whatever. It looked just like her, Tash. I swear. And you didn't... you didn't say anything? Was she that bad? No, that's the thing. She was with this guy, like-like in a suit. There was a minivan, kids... Okay, definitely not her. Now if you told me she was with a doper ned Double Wide and holding a meth pipe, then I'd believe you. It was her. I know it. I wanted to say something, but it all just happened so fast. And-and I-I wanted to check it out before, you know, you-you got your hopes up. But this could be the answer you need. What if instead of going three hours away to another crappy foster home, you stayed right here? With your mom? Lux. Wake up. She's a junkie, not a soccer mom. I'm not you. No one's gonna appear out of nowhere and save the day. Some of us don't have anyone. You have me. And I'm not letting you go. RYAN: And we're back. And we have our 100th caller on the line. And congratulations! You are the 20th and final contestant for tomorrow's "Hands on a Hybrid" competition. Cate? How do you feel about being stuck... Baze?! (chuckles) That's right. What are you doing? I'm calling to finish our conversation. Why don't you call back later, Baze? Uh, the adults are working here. You know what? There's no need to finish our conversation. The contest sounds like a much better way to finish things. You count me in. And you know what else? You can tell your pretty boy fiancÃ© to get ready because I am going to kick his ass. Baze in the contest? No, this is a disaster. Do you know what's going to happen if Baze and Ryan are trapped on a car for any length of time? Okay, Baze hasn't said anything about the drunken sex for this long. So I doubt he's going to say anything now. Right? I did something else. Oh, God... Okay. Last week, you know, after Baze was on the show, Ryan- he confronted me, and asked if anything's ever happened between us since high school and, um... I lied. I know, I told Ryan that Baze made a pass at me and I pushed him away. (sighs) You are so Days of Our Lives. I'm gonna have to start tuning in at 1:00 to watch you. Radical thought here. Why not just tell Baze that you lied to Ryan? Tell Baze that I threw him under the bus to save my relationship and that's why he hasn't been seeing his daughter? He's just going to tell Ryan the truth. And what about you, Cate? Are you ever going to tell Ryan the truth? Hmm? I don't know. I... (sighs) Alice, I have just made a mess out of everything. And I don't know how to get out of this without losing everything that I care about. Oh, sweetie. I have to tell him. I just... I need to figure out how and when, and I will. But in the meantime, could you just pull Baze out of the contest? Oh, Cate, I love you. But the station- they're already promoting a Ryan/Baze showdown. And people- they're excited. I'm people. And I'm not excited. I know. And I'm sorry, but Baze is in. Okay, I'm here. What's the 911? Good news. I did some recon. I called that rehab place your mom bailed on, and they said that she eventually completed her program at another facility, so I called that place and I got her address. Seriously? Yeah, it wasn't that hard. I just to pretend that I was with her insurance company. No, I mean... you have my mom's address? She's still in town, T. I went to the house to confirm it. Same minivan and everything. I pretended to be on the phone. I took a picture as I walked by. My God, it's her. She looks really good. I know. This is the answer, T. If she's recovered, then she can take you in and-and you won't have to move away. No, it's not. If she's recovered and she hasn't tried to get me back, she doesn't want me. You don't know that. And-and the last time you saw her, didn't you tell her you hated her and never wanted to see her again? 'Cause she was high on dope on my birthday. Yeah. Well, maybe she hasn't tried to get you back because she thinks that you don't want her. Think about it. You haven't taken any of her phone calls or ansred any of her letters. Maybe she'been waiting aund for you all this time. What if I go over there and she doesn't want me? Okay, then what? Then you're no worse off than you are now. JAMIE: What you need to do is train. Put your hand on the bar. All right, now, imagine yourself deep in the competition. You and Ryan are head-to-head. Your feet are tired. Your back is sore. And you smell funky, then suddenly... Dude! You got to work on your focus, man. Math's girlfriend's here. Hey. Can we talk? Yeah. Um... I need you to drop out of the contest tomorrow. What? You afraid your hotshot fiancÃ© is gonna lose? 'Cause you should be. All right, look, I- I know that you and I- we're not in the best place, but Ryan and I, we finally are. And for as cool as he seems, you're an issue for him. So it would just be great if you could you know... back off. Do you even care that that guy's bogarting my fatherly duties? Because he cares about Lux. You know, he is going to be in her life. He wants to provide for her, and give her things that she's never had. Things you don't think that I can give her? That's not what I said. But that's what you meant. God, Cate, I am so sick of you and Ryan acting like I can't be a good parent to Lux. She's been in our lives the same amount of time, Cate. You don't have any more experience than I do. Well, last time I checked, giving birth to her counts for something. Then you gave her up. What-what does that count for? Let me be clear. I'm not dropping out of that competition to make you happy. You are the one keeping me from Lux. You are the one with a douche fiancÃ©. And you are the one coming here yelling at me. So, the only way I am walking away from that contest is with the car. âª Still ugly on the inside. âª CATE: Good morning, Portland! (all cheering) Hi, I am Cate Cassidy, and on behalf of K-100 and Massad Motors, I would like to welcome you to the annual "Hands on a Hybrid" competition! (all cheering) The rules are very simple: Ten-minute breaks every two hours. No leaning on the car, no squatting down. And you take your hand off for even oeven one second, you will be... disqualified. You're really going through with this, huh? How observant. Get ready to be even more of a loser. Now let's get your hands on a hybrid! (all cheering) (whistle blowing) I can't believe you convinced me to wear this dress. All I said was lose the black. What if my mom laughs when she sees me in polka dots? She's not going to laugh. Tash, she's gonna be so happy to see you. This is it? You sure? Told you. She's a different person. It worked out for me. It can work out for you. Come on, Tash. We should go. Yes? Oh, my God. Mom. Oh, my God, Natasha. Oh, sweetheart. Hey there, Portland. We are live at our "Hands on a Hybrid" competition. We're four hours in, going strong, and, uh, yeah, not much has changed. Then again, what do you expect from a competition where people stand still for days? But at least our crowd seems to be enjoying themselves. Am I right, people? (cheering) Let's show 'em, Baze! You chumps are going down in a Baze of glory! Let's Baze it up! And Ryan. Go, Ryan. And let's check in with our defending champion. How you feeling? Great, great. Prepared to stand here for days if that's what it takes. All right, well, you keep it up, babe. Yeah, the more days you're here, the less nights I have to hear you snore. âª Sweet Lord, Saturday's child... âª And then there's our other crowd favorite. His name is Wang Zu, and he is rocking those black shades. Little poker face going on. How are you feeling about your chances there, Wang? âª My little continental girl... âª Wang? BAZE: Excuse me. I'm sorry. (clearing his throat) Maybe he's blind. He would still be able to hear, genius. You're gonna have to interview me eventually. I mean, that is, after Ryan drops out because he misses his hair products. (blows whistle) And it's break time. We are back with Jeremy in the studio. âª Yeah, here she comes âª âª Sweet Lord, Saturday's child âª âª Child âª âª And while your friends are busy paying âª âª On the morning after, oh, yeah âª âª You're drinking your mimosa âª âª While you're planning your next social disaster... âª (laughter) Oh, yeah. Round one... Let's go. Good stuff, man. (Baze groans) Oh. Talk to me, buddy. What's wrong? Oh, I don't know if I can win. My dogs are barking. Oh, you got to put those hobbit feet away. Okay, listen to me. You are a bartender. You stand for a living. You're a professional stander. You let yourself get beat by one of these weekend amateurs? I don't know. Ryan looks pretty formidable. He's got calves the size of hams. I'm gonna scope the situation out. How you feeling? Piece of cake. Can you, uh...? Yeah. Yeah. Ooh. Yeah, fifth hour's where people start dropping like flies. Ah, well, thank you for being so cool about Baze you know, and not making an issue. Yeah, I won't... unless he gets in my face. CATE: What do you mean, gets in your face? Well, I can't stand the guy, but as long as he stays away from me, I'm fine. (Ryan sighs) All I'm saying is, it wouldn't hurt to use a little pumice every once in a while. Math is right about Ryan. Calves of steel, but he has a weak spot. Okay, his kryptonite: his Achilles' heel. What is it? You. My suggestion? You stand right next to him, get all up in his business. He'll drop out just to get away from you. All right, now, come on. You can take this fool down. You get out there. You show 'em what you got. Yeah. And you come at me with pumice. (door squeaks open) What happened? Wait. Tasha! Leave me alone. Tash, wait! Stop. What did she do? What did... What did she say? What do you think she said? She said no. What?! She's worked hard to-to get sober, to-to rebuild her life. She can't risk relapsing. She has two new little kids. They need her. Wh-What do you have to do with relapsing? 'Cause she says that I remind her of the past, of my dad. Of course, you do. You're her kid! No, no, no. We have to go back there. I'll talk to her. I'll convince her. No, Lux, forget it, okay? Don't do anything. You've done enough. Ryan? Ry-man. The Ryanator. What say we get to know each other a little better? RYAN: Let's not. Get a little up close and personal. Back off, dude. What? You can't take a little friendly competition? Hmm? Cate, I need to talk to you. It's an emergency. Why? What's wrong? I want this car, so you might as well give up right now. Mm-hmm, you're not even gonna make it through the night. Is that what you think? Well, for some reason, you don't strike me as the kind of guy who stands by something all the way to the end. What was that supposed to mean? Well, let's see. You got Cate pregnant in high school, and you denied you did it. And then, 16 years later, you try and take advantage of her again, and again, you want to act like it didn't even happen. What are you talking about? The night Lux took off, and you and Cate went back to your bar. I know what happened. The thing is, if I don't find another way, then, she's gonna be gone. Look, man, I'm really sorry. I didn't know she told you. I mean, I can understand why you'd be pissed, but I didn't take advantage of anybody. You know, blame the tequila, high school nostalgia, whatever, but it was pretty mutual. It's not mutual when somebody pushes you away. What do you mean, pushes you away? What-What are you talk...? Who pushed who away? Cate pushed you away, you jackass, when you tried to kiss her. Come on, man, the night Lux went missing. Stop playing dumb. She told me. Like, three hours away gone. I'll never be able to see her. Yeah, you're right. Oh. I tried to kiss her. What can I say, Ryan? I mean, you know, I had to... wonder. Did she get any better after 16 years? (grunts) (crowd groaning and sighing) Ow, my nose. I can't believe he punched me in the nose. Oh, my God. Baze. Oh, God, my nose. Did he break my nose? Oh, my God, I can't believe he hit me in the nose. CATE: Ryan, I am so sorry. Honestly, it meant nothing. No, it meant less than nothing. It was drunken and stupid, you know? And I've never regretted anything more in my life. If I could take it back, I would. Wait. What? I swear. Sleeping with Baze again- it was the biggest mistake of my life. When did you sleep with Baze again? Okay, Ryan, just listen. Just give me a chance to explain everything. When did this happen? The night I told you he kissed me. Oh. No. We were... You know, we were talking about Lux. Then we started talking about the winter formal, and it... Cate, I asked you if you had slept with him, and you told me no. Yeah, because I didn't want to hurt you. You know, Ryan, you and I- we weren't together. Not together? I proposed! Yeah, but we got in that fight on the dock and broke up, and I just thought that Lux was gonna be a deal-breaker for you, so... No, don't put this on me. I'm not. I am just saying that, you know, technically, you and I- we were not together. I'm sorry. Are you seriously trying to argue that you didn't cheat on a technicality? You said that love was understanding, being honest. I am being honest. Because you got caught! Do you get the difference? (Cate sighs) Okay, Ryan, where are you going? I'm leaving. No. Okay, I'll come with you. Let me just find somebody to cover for us. Cate, I'm not just leaving the contest. I'm leaving you. No. Ryan, listen, listen. We can get through this. Listen, this is you and me. Just listen, please. No. Cate, I've been listening. I listened to you mock my proposal. I listened to you give me my ring back. I listened to you say you wanted to be a family with me and Lux. I listened to you swear that there was nothing to worry about with Baze. I am done listening. I am done understanding. I am done being the good guy. No! Ryan, no! , no! No, Cate, it is your turn to listen. This relationship? It's over. No. Ryan? Ryan! âª Is it then that your soul starts to bleed? âª âª Have you ever seen the president âª âª Who killed your wounded child? âª âª Or the man that crashed your sister's plane âª âª Claiming he was sent of God? âª âª And when she died in your arms âª You okay? âª Late that night in the dark... âª No, not really. Um... Ryan- he just found out about... about everything. That I slept with Baze again. Oh. God, I'm sorry. Okay, I'm gonna get Scotty from DriveTime to cover for me. Let's go. I just... I cannot be here. Cate, I-I know this isn't the best time. I need a favor. A- A big one. What? And I wouldn't ask you if it wasn't incredibly important to me. I need you to take Tasha. Yeah, take her where? No, I mean, take Tasha in to live with us. With the extra stipend from the state, it wouldn't cost anything, and she and I can share thom. Wait, Lux, just... will you slow down, please? Just slow down. There's just... There's just not a lot of time. That's a really big decision. If we don't do this now, they're gonna send her away to another crappy foster home far away from everything. Far away from me. The timing of all of this right now... Yoand I- we're just starting to figure things out, and right now, with Ryan... I st... This is just a lot. I have never asked you for anything before. You said that I uld come to you. That you would be there and-and do anything to help. Well, this would help. This would fix everything. I've already lost Bug. Tasha's the only friend that I have left. So, please. This is the only thing I'll ever ask you. I swear. The only thing. âª Crash this train... âª Please? âª So, God, if you can hear me... âª Lux, I can't. âª I said, God, if you can hear me... âª Not right now, not like this. I... I'm sorry. âª I said, now, God, if you can hear me âª Me, too. âª Crash this train âª âª Oh... âª I called Cate. I told her you were gonna chill here tonight. (grunts and clears throat) So, we're a mess, huh? None of us getting what we really wanted. You, Tasha. Me, the car. You're really more of a truck guy. I couldn't have pictured you, that, you know, low to the ground. I didn't want to win the car for me. I wanted to win it for you. Look, lately, it's just... it just seems like it's you and Ryan and Cate. This family. I don't think that's gonna be an issue anymore. It's not just that. Cate. She can get you stuff that I can't. She can buy you whatever you want. And a few weeks ago, you were paying my rent. And I just wanted something to give you. Something to show you that I... You know. You never need to get me anything. I know. It still would have been a cool dad move to give you your first car. There is something I want way more. It wouldn't cost anything. Thank you for, uh, coming on such short notice, Fern. My pleasure. You said you wanted to discuss a custody issue? Yeah, yeah. Uh, we've really cleaned up the place. Bong lamp's relocated; sheep's been put out to pasture; smoke detectors have new batteries, and tomorrow I got a guy putting a railing on the roof deck. It's quite an improvement from the last time. Yeah, um, well, I know you have my paperwork from before, but I printed you an updated bank statement. My bar has started turning a profit. There's actually money in my account now, so that's better. Very good. And over here... This would be Tasha's room. Uh, Tasha? I'm sorry. I assumed you wanted to talk about custody of Lux. No, no, it's Tasha we're worried about. Oh. What you've done here, it's impressive. But for you to take in Tasha is simply not possible. A single man taking in a teenager who's not a blood relative, the courts would never approve it. However, when we first met, I told you that while Lux is still a ward of the state, if things improved, I would consider you for joint physical custody of her. I think that time is now. What does that mean? It means that you can now live here, too. Here and Cate's. Are you serious? Mm-hmm, it's always preferable to grant custody to both parents, assuming that they're capable. And given what I've seen, you certainly are. (chuckling) Wow. âª So many times âª âª I've heard the runaround âª âª I walk the line âª âª âª âª Come tomorrow âª What are you doing? Packing. Baze is waiting for me outside. Fern just approved this morning for 50/50 custody. What? And since I've been living with you for the past month... But when did you meet with Fern? This morning. I'm gonna chill at Baze's for a while. Lux, I don't understand. Is this because of Tasha? It's because of you. You said that I could come to you for whatever I needed. That you'd be there. You weren't. Baze... he was. âª Come tomorrow, there's gonna be a change âª âª âª âª It's time to rearrange âª âª And I'll get all of my ducks in a row âª âª Come tomorrow âª So, uh, you met with Fern to get custody? Is this your way of getting back at me for lying about you to Ryan? It was for Tasha. No, this is for you. Don't act like this isn't what you wanted this whole time. To be with my kid? Yeah, Cate, yeah, I did. I'm sorry. Of course you want to be with Lux. I do, too. I'm getting what I deserve. You don't deserve this, Cate. Yeah, you screwed up with Ryan. But so did I. I mean, not with Ryan, with you. Things will... they'll be okay. Nothing's permanent. You know, maybe we could all use a little change. I didn't want a change. I didn't want to lose him. I don't want to lose her. Not now. I know. I know, and you won't. âª I woke up and wished that I was dead âª âª With an aching in my head âª âª I lay motionless in bed âª âª I thought of you and where you'd gone âª âª And let the world spin madly on âª âª Everything that I said I'd do âª âª Like make the world brand-new âª âª And take the time for you âª âª I just got lost and slept right through the dawn âª âª And the world spins madly on âª âª I let the day go by âª âª I always say good-bye âª âª I watch the stars from my window sill âª âª The whole world is moving âª âª And I'm standing still âª I didn't even get to say good-bye. âª Woke up and wished that I was dead âª âª With an aching in my head âª âª I lay motionless in bed âª âª The night is here, and the day is gone âª (sobbing) âª I thought of you and where you'd gone âª âª And the world spins madly on âª âª And the world spins madly on âª âª And on and on. âª www.addic7ed.com
