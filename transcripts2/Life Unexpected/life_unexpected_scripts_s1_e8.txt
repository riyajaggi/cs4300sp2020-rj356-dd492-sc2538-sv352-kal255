 Previously on Life Unexpected: You and someone had a kid. You gave up that kid. - I am that kid. - Cate cassidy, that's your mom. I am Cate Cassidy. Ryan and I have been up since 5:00. And as usual, arguing since 6:00. What are you doing? Will you marry me? You've met the qualifications as foster parents and will be granted temporary joint custody of Lux. Oh, my God! Tell me this didn't happen! It happened - twice. What are you doing here? I was going to see if Lux wanted to grab a bite. I'm taking her driving. Don't you think it's more of a dad-type duty?

 Well, when she's here, I kind of fill that role. Bug left. I did what you said. I told him the truth and he left. That family wants me. They're three hours away. We've never been that far. Sleeping with Baze again- it was the biggest mistake of my life. When did you sleep with Baze again? It's over. I need you to take Tasha, to live with us. Lux, I can't. This is the only thing I'll ever ask you. I'm sorry. Me, too. First and foremost, you have to take care of yourself. Because nobody else will.

 Get a mani-pedi, wax your lady business, you know, whatever it is, do it for yourself- not for him. WOMAN Thank you, Cate. I know you're right. Yeah, or else, before you know it, you're wandering down the aisles of supermarkets scrounging for free samples in your give-ups. Give-ups? Yeah, sweatpants. Sweats in public are give-ups. No matter how cute they are or what they say across the ass, because that's what you're telling the world- "I give up and I'm hungry." Hey, sweatpants are a perfectly comfortable option. I wear them, Michelle Obama wears them. Baze wears them. The point is, Cate, you have Ryan so it doesn't matter what you wear. You're right, Lucy, it doesn't matter. But for the record, I call my sweatpants move-ons, because that's what I'm doing when I wear them. And right now, I'm going to be moving on to weather with Hazy Daisy on Morning Madness. Daisy, take it away. Is this what it's going to be like every morning? You taking snipes at me and making swipes at Baze, because that's not making this any easier. Well, it sure as hell can't make it any harder. You guys are doing great. Better than I thought. This isn't awkward at all. If Bug wanted to work things out, he would've called by now. Same with Gavin. Can you believe what jerks our boyfriends turned into? Yours takes off when you ask him to treat you better and mine dry-humps a skateboarding tramp behind my back. I can't believe he did that to you. Though for all I know, Bug could be doing the same thing. Or maybe he's laying in a ditch somewhere, left for dead. Comforting, Tash. Like a warm blanket. Oh, whatever. He'll be back sooner or later; you'll see. Bug's a good guy, deep down. Just feels like everyone I know is disappearing. I'm here. No, you're three hours away. What happened with Cate? Did you guys talk? Why bother. She doesn't get it. No one does. What about Baze? Baze is... milking a cow? Hold on, Tash. What? I thought we were going to squeeze in some driving lessons before school. I'm not feeling it. And you suck at miming. Well, how about school? Are you feeling school? 'Cause I'm feeling it. Maybe Monday. I got to admit, I was psyched about having Lux stay with us, but she's so depressing. And how long can she cry over a guy with a web on his neck? She'll get over him. Yeah? Like you got over Cate? You and Jamie really need some new material. I don't want to dampen your new adventures in Daddyland, but you can't keep letting Lux skip school. That's two days in a row now. I'll have her back Monday. I don't want to push her too hard, you know? Kids need to be pushed. And Lux needs friends, which she can't make if she's never at school. She has friends. Name one. Tasha. One that lives in Portland. Come on. How can my kid not have friends? She does. There's um... The... The beer delivery guy- what's his face. Manuelo? Manuelo. Always chatting it up. Oh, what the hell...? Hey. I thought I'd drop by on my way to school. You okay, little dude? Yeah, it backfires now and then, but... You're Lux's dad, right? I think I remember you yelling and screaming. Bug stole your car. I remember. What are you doing here? Um, I have stuff for Lux- homework. I thought she might want it. Math could have done that. I, uh, I volunteered. You're checking up on her. I saw how that Bug guy was to her. I just thought she could use a friend. So, uh... y-you consider yourself a friend... of Lux's? Yeah. I don't know if Lux told you about the bike thing and Bug... Bug- Bug's out of the picture. Exterminated, so to speak. But not dead. He just took off. So we should be seeing a decline of auto theft soon. And Lux, is she okay? If "okay" means "moody and antisocial," yeah, she's okay. You know... ...you could do me a favor. And seeing that you clearly want an excuse to see Lux, maybe it's not that much of a favor to ask after all. Now, I know a great mechanic who can check out your wheels, no cost to you. All you have to do is say yes. What's the question? You're asking me out? Like, on a date? Why? What do you mean why? 'Cause I want to go out with you. What do you have in mind? I stand in the cheering section at one of your games? We share a milkshake at the Dairy Hut? Don't hate on milkshakes. You know what I mean. You're... you're Abercrombie. I'm the Foster Freak Bong Girl. There's an inherent compatibility issue. Really? I thought it was the classic story. Boy meets Bong Girl. Boy tries to kiss Bong Girl. Boy awkwardly asks out Bong Girl... How about this: You and me, tomorrow. No cheering section, no milkshakes. I think I know something you'll love. How do you know what I love? I have my ways. But you won't find out unless you say yes. I love my job, I do, especially since Lux is gone, Ryan dumped me, and my job is all I have left in the world. That's the spirit. But you can't realistically expect Ryan and I to keep pretending to be engaged and in love, when our entire relationship has fallen apart. What I can't do is keep changing the show to match your latest crisis. I'm not even a producer anymore- I'm a janitor. I mopped up the Lux thing, the engagement thing, the Baze thing- with corporate and our audience- and now everyone loves Cate and Ryan, the happy couple, so until further notice, that's who you are, okay? Right. I made my bed, now I have to lie about it. Awesome. I know that it's tough, but, hey, maybe you guys will work things out. Or hey, maybe we won't. You know, as long as Ryan is baring his teeth at me, it's not like I'm gonna say, "Hey, here, here, here's my heart. Why don't you chew it up again?" You know, between him calling off the engagement, and Lux leaving me for Baze... None of that. I need you to buck up and keep it together, okay? Breaking down is not an option. I know. I won't. I just need the weekend off, so I don't have to think about Ryan and engagements and weddings. That's funny. You're kidding, right? Do you know what tomorrow is? Saturday. Okay, I'm going to try again. Do you remember, after we announced your engagement, you and Ryan agreed to be the celeb hosts at the bridal expo? Wait, you didn't cancel that?! No, I didn't cancel that. I can't just cancel it, Cate. There is a lot- a lot- of money involved, and we're using the expo to launch the new marketing campaign. What new marketing campaign? Remember, you said it yourself, you love your job. Transcrypt by www.addic7ed.com Who knew Hell was a bridal expo? I kind of did. And I don't want to add any unnecessary pressure 'cause I know you're on the verge of going postal, but... Oh, ballroom dancing, bridal photo shoot, "Nearlywed" Game? What, no practicing for the wedding night to dial this day up to completely insufferable? Okay, let's think more bubbly bride, less unbridled bitch? It's fine, it's fine. I can do it. It's only eight hours. How hard can it be? Hey, they're asking for the happy couple on stage. That's us. You can do this. Remember- bubbly. Jones, my man. Hey, how's the car? Running great. Yeah? You really didn't have to do that, man. Hey, just helping a brother out. Okay, now, do you have everything you need? Gas money? Road sodas? Tofurkey jerky? Yeah, we're good. Okay, let me go get her. Hey. What are you doing? Jones is here. I know! Right on time. This is already a disaster! Who goes on dates at 9:00 a.m.? Well, apparently, little dude's got big plans. Yeah... Yes, he says it's a surprise. Surprise! Worst date ever. Bug never would've picked me at 9:00 a.m. And when the waiter brought my nachos, there it was around a jalapeÃ±o- my engagement ring. And then the mariachi band was playing "Here Comes the Bride," and I was, like, " SÃ­, Oscar! SÃ­, SÃ­, SÃ­! Um, Yeah. Muchas graÃ§ias, Ashley. Okay, now, please welcome our radio hosts, from K-100's Morning Madness, Cate and Ryan! We can do this, right? Well, if anybody can lie, it's you. And they're gonna share their engagement story while we tally the votes. What up, Portland! And congratulations, you girls are a tough act to follow. Uh, right, the classic nacho story- how charming is that? So, if you're a fan of Morning Madness, you already know our story. Proposing to Kate was like... going on a Japanese game show - there was a lot of yelling, a lot of things being thrown at your head. Oh, it was one remote. I felt ambushed. Or, as some women say, "surprised." I tried again. It was touch and go there for a while, but, uh... she finally said yes. Well, actually, I asked you back. And you said yes. Yeah. I sure did. I think that Philip has our winner. Philip? Okay, you guys want to know who won? All right! Yeah! If you were lost, would you admit it? 'Cause we seem really lost. It seems like we've been driving for, like, two days. We're not lost. MAN One, two, three... Shut up! What? Wha...? Who gave you this mix? What do you mean? I made it. Change it if you want. No, no. I love it. The Shaky Hands, Red Fang, the Dirty Mittens! We have pretty much exactly the same taste in music. And me and my friend Tasha saw the Shaky Hands at Pop Now. No way. Mm-hmm. Last July? Mm-hmm. I was there. But that place was tiny. I probably spilled a drink on you. I'd remember that. I can't believe you like them. If this was a cheesy romantic comedy, this would be when we fell totally in love, realize we were soul mates. Or not. You might be the only father in America who's actually encouraging his daughter's dating life. Okay. Here's a reality check- you see that couch? No Lux. Why? Because Lux is out having fun with her friend, the high school quarterback. Now, what do you think about that? Huh? Whoa. Your phone was on vibrate, and... why is Ryan texting you? Huh? Maybe he's finally apologizing. For what? For punching you off the car. I mean, what was that about? What'd you ever do to him? Yeah, who knows? That's not my phone; that's Lux's phone. Let me look at this. Dude, invasion of privacy. No, no, no. Why is Ryan texting Lux? "Hang in there, kiddo. "Sorry to hear about Bug, but Jones sounds like he's a good guy-" Okay, why is Lux talking to Ryan about Jones? I'm the Jones connection. There would be no Jones without me. Baze, put it down. Seriously? Okay, okay, listen to this. "I'm at a bridal expo all day, "but how does next Saturday sound for car shopping?" He's buying her a new car? Are you kidding me? She won't even let me give her driving lessons. I try to get her a car, he knocks me off of it. She... She doesn't talk to me about boys. I mean, no wonder I can't get any traction- I'm being secretly undermined by Captain Jerk Sauce. Whatever you're doing, don't. What? What? What single guy doesn't love bridal expos? I mean, I'm just gonna go, and I am going to do a little drive-by, take in the new tuxedo trends, peruse a new china pattern or two. I am gonna show Ryan that just because he punched me off of the car does not mean that he won the fight. This is not a good idea. I now pronounce you... husband and meringue. Oh, sweetie, it's... one photo for a Web site. We don't have to find the gown, just... one that's not hideous. Oh, they're all hideous on me. They really are. That? Not helping. Look, if you want to cry, now's the time to do it- you've got... four minutes. I'm not gonna cry. I just keep thinking how... how I am supposed to be one of those girls. You know? Meeting with a florist, tasting cake... I love cake. Do you, uh, do you want me to get you a tissue? No, I'm fine. Because now I'm not one of those girls, and I'm not gonna be, and I just... I just have to be okay with that. Are you sure? You've still got three and a half minutes. Stop timing me! All right. Well, eyes on the prize. If you can get through this, you can get through anything- the show, alienating your loved ones... being alone for the rest of your life. âª Full of possibilities âª âª Suddenly, suddenly... âª Hello, albino mermaid. Oh, this is impossible. Just... just choose one and meet me out there, okay? âª...like today, I could âª âª Fall in love with you âª âª On a day, on a day... âª What the hell is this place? I told you, you didn't have to come with me. I wanted to; to support you. Where's Cate? Hi. Uh, we're looking for, uh, Cate and Ryan. Yeah, who isn't? They're backstage. All right, we'll find 'em. Uh, I'm sorry. You know Cate and Ryan? Yeah. I'm the father of Cate's kid. And this big guy wishes he was. You're Baze. Baze from the show. Yeah. Heard you were quite the spectacle at the car show last week. You're becoming a K-100 staple. That's me. Just can't stay away. Uh, Alice, never mind the super fans- I got something much better. Do you want to... come with me? Come on. This is it? Yep. Hm. Am I meeting your grandparents? 'Cause that would be really weird for a first date. Oh, my God. Tasha! You made it! How did you know? I called her and got the address. I mean, we could still go to the Dairy Hut, if you'd rather. Hey... I missed you so much. âª Without any fear and âª âª It's not all darkness âª âª Not all light... âª Is anyone out there? Alice, if you are out there laughing at me, I'm gonna kill you. âª Sit with me tonight... âª I can help. âª The sound of our breathing âª âª In the TV light... âª Okay. âª I don't want to fight it âª âª Just sit with me tonight âª âª Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh âª âª Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh... âª Wow. Hate it, right? What a joke. I mean, it just took me a little while to find a dress. This is the only one that doesn't make me look... totally marshmallowy. You don't look marshmallowy at all. You look beautiful. That's exactly how I imagined. Not that I... was thinking about it for hours, it's just, you know, yeah, I had this image of what I thought you might look like on our wedding day. I'm glad I got to see it. Well, now you can go back to hating me. I don't hate you, Cate. And if I hated you, this... wouldn't be so hard. You're not the only one trying to make it through the day. Is that what we're trying to do? âª Just sit with me tonight... âª I mean, I know that we're over, and... I'm moving on, and that's fine... but if you don't want to... âª Sit with me tonight... âª Uh, Cate... I mean, if we can pretend like this for the world, act like nothing happened... can't we just do that for ourselves? It doesn't work like that. But we can try. Can't we? What is taking so long? Ryan, you're supposed to be getting her. Yeah, right. Cate, we have a photo shoot. Just forget it; we'll do it later. We're behind schedule. Wait, wait... We'll talk later. Are you still good? Hm? Good. Here. Put this on. Couple of things, real quick. One- this will be over soon. Two- I had nothing to do with picking out the contestants. What contestants? And you look so pretty. K-100 welcomes you to our main event! Featuring our blushing bride-to-be Cate Cassidy and her fiancÃ© Ryan Thomas! Now, you two are just months away from your big day, but Ryan, how well do you really know Cate? Well, I'd say, I'd say it's around 70 to 85% on a good day. What am I, a pie chart? Now, today, you're gonna have to prove that you know the person you're about to marry better than anyone else. If I can have you sit over here. And to give Ryan a run for his money, please welcome our contestants, two superfans of Morning Madness, Cate's high school stalker Matthew! Math? I'm, I'm not a stalker. I'm a longtime fan. Okay. Then tell them I'm not a stalker. And you know him from the show, Cate's high school crush, Baze! What the hell's going on? What are you doing here? Oh, you know me, K-100 superfan. I just love these contests. Best of luck to you, Ryan. And welcome to the "Nearlywed Game." Now remember, just because they look like the perfect couple doesn't mean they are... Listen to me. I have been doing well, really well, until this happened. You need to makehis the opposite of happening. ...really knows Cate as well as he thinks he does. And I'll take it from here. Thank you, Phillip. Thank you. Well, this should be fun and brief. Since everyone knows that Cate and Ryan are a match made in heaven- right? Aw... So I'll ask a question, guys, you'll write down an answer. You know, you're unbelievable. You don't know any boundaries. You're one to talk. What's next for Lux, a starter ho? Excuse me, guys? Huh? You'll write down your answers. and whoever matches Cate's wins the point. Bring it. So it's okay here? Eh, it's whatever. I was right. They just wanted a babysitter. Yeah. Like, the Owens, do you remember Chuck and Rachel? Oh, yeah, the Children of the Corn, mm-hmm. Didn't they, like, try to set you on fire? I still flinch whenever someone strikes a match. So, Jones... he's cuter than I remember. You know, he was at that show, the Shaky Hands, the one we snuck into. Hm! You know, Bug never would've done anything this thoughtful. Not true. He would've driven you here. In a stolen car. Speaking of- he, uh, he called. He's in Sacramento at some hostel- "Rose" something- I wrote his number down, and I told him if he talks to Gavin, tell him to suck it. I don't know if I want it. I told Bug he was a moron to leave. Take it anyway, in case you change your mind. And we have Matt at zero, and Ryan at two, and surprisingly, Baze at three. Okay, let's switch it up for the last question, and Cate can match. Pens down. Everyone ready? The question was: "What is Cate's favorite song?" Math? What does that say? "I couldn't remember the name, but she sang it "in a talent show, sophomore year. "Something about the snow coming down in June and the Sun going around the Moon." All right. Baze! What is "Bitchin' Camaro." It's the name of a song and it's also the name of my first car which my father gave me. Not some freak fake stepfather figure, but my actual father. That's what this is about? Oh, it's not just about the car, dude. I saw the texts. Way out of line. Can we just keep this moving? Okay, Ryan... Hello. What's on your card? "The Luckiest," Ben Folds Five. Finally, an actual answer, and if Cate's card matches, Ryan wins the round. Cate? Did you scratch your answer out? All right, game over, people. Let's go cake-tasting. No, no, no, no, no! Not so fast. We have one last question for the tiebreaker. Right? Here we go. What is your number one relationship deal breaker? Listen, I get that you and Cate have issues. I just don't care. I wasn't buying Lux a car, you jackass. I was buying myself a car. I told her I'd give her my old one. Yeah. You feel stupid now? No, 'cause it's still not okay. Listen, you have no business chatting with her about boys, either, okay? I am the one responsible for her date with Jones. I made him ask her out. Oh, right, that's not gonna come back to bite you in the ass. Good job, dad. That's right. I'm her dad. Me, okay? So until you stop stepping on my turf, I'm going to be all over yours. Time's up! Math... ...what is your relationship deal breaker? Well, I was trying to decide whether you meant my deal breaker or a general deal breaker. Uh, then I realized that if I were dating Cate, there'd really be only one thing that would end our relationship. "The apocalypse." Sure. Baze? Wow. No car. Okay, perhaps you misunderstood the question. And Ryan, if you've written actual words on paper, you win. My relationship deal breaker? Baze. Okay, that was awful. I know that was awful. Dude, Ryan, wait up. Go away! You want to be the parent, go be one. What's going on? Look, Baze is a deal breaker for me, too. Oh, this, I love this. I'm the bad guy now? I'm the deal breaker? You're mad. I get that. Your relationship with Cate fell apart, you're upset, but you cannot keep taking it out on me by sabotaging my relationship with Lux. If anyone is going to give Lux a clunker, it should be me. And in fact, I was going to give her a new car, but you punched me off of it. I wouldn't have punched you off of it if you weren't such a sleazebag. Sleazebag? Yeah, you know, the kind of guy who sleeps with another man's fiancÃ©e? What? Oh... that is what I am talking about, dude- keep it separated! I didn't even know you existed when I slept with Cate. It wasn't like she was calling out your name. She asked me not to say anything, and I didn't. So if I did anything wrong, it's that I listened to Cate. What the hell is the matter with you? Ryan's right, you are a sleazebag. Math, come on, man. Get your own ride, Nate. You know what? Baze is right. For once, he said something that makes sense. It's not his fault. The real question is what the hell is wrong with you? Ryan... Ryan... You know, earlier you asked me if we could put this all behind us, if we could just go on pretending, but that's all you ever do. You pretend like nothing's happening, when it is. You act like everything is okay when it's not. And then you lie to protect whatever twisted reality you've created for yourself. No, I told you the truth. I told you about Baze. Accidentally doesn't count. You want to be honest? You tell me why you did it. Why was he worth trashing our relationship? Oh, God, Ryan, he wasn't. It was stupid. It was a mistake. I don't even know why I did it. Yeah, you don't know. If you risk everything, everything that we had on something stupid, some mistake, then you're even more screwed up than I thought. No, don't bother trying to fix us, Cate. Just fix yourself. You just had to put this song on. Now it's gonna be stuck in my head for days. Well, it's something to remember me by. I could drive you again sometime, to Tasha's or wherever. You know it's only, like, seven hours to Whistler? Um... don't take this the wrong way, but I thought today was gonna be a disaster. It's sucked so bad since Tash left. And Bug. But today was the first time I felt like someone else got me, you know? That sounds corny. Even the word "corny" sounds corny. But what you did today was really thoughtful. I want to tell you something. Okay. Earlier, when you asked me how I knew about Tasha's, I didn't say 'cause I don't know, I wanted you to think it was my idea. Well, whose was it? Your dad's. When I brought you your homework yesterday- my lame excuse to see you- I ran into Baze first. I was, I was having car trouble, and he offered to hook me up with his mechanic if I asked you out. I'm sorry, what? He-He just wanted me to get you out of the house, get your mind off Bug. In exchange for a tune-up? No! I-I mean, that was, that was a bonus. Not-Not that I needed a bonus. I just... I-I was worried you'd get the wrong idea if you found out. And that's why I wanted to tell you myself, because... I like you. But Baze had to tell you to ask me out. He told you about Tasha. Did-Did he give you a list of bands I like, too? No! I was up till 2:00 a.m. making this mix. Look, Lux, the only reason why I told you is because it's not a big deal. It is a big deal. And if you don't get that, then you don't get me. Hey, you're back from your date. You mean your date? What's wrong? What happened? Really? What happened? You know what happened. You know where we went, you know who we saw. You probably had the car tapped and were listening to our conversation the whole time. Ooh. You know, I didn't think of that. Oh, come on, Lux. Lux, I'm sorry. All right, you have just been so bummed. About everything. And then Jones shows up, and I could tell that he liked you. He just needed some tips. So I was like his... dating Google. God, you're lame. I wanted you to be happy. Jones seemed like a good kid. Then you date him! He's available! And the next time that you want to cheer me up, don't. Hello? Hi. I- I'm looking for a guy named Bobby. Bobby Guthrie. I'm sorry? He also goes by Bug. Oh, Bug. He's not here right now. But I can take your number. It's all right, I, um... Actually, can you leave him a message? Just say that Lux called and... tell him to come home. Listen, if you talk, this is just gonna take that much longer, and neither of us want that. âª Another night with nothin' to do... âª You were right. I was overstepping with Lux, and I'm sorry. I- I get that you're her father, all right? And I want to respect that. But she's part of my life now, and if she wants me to be there for her, I'm gonna be. She's had enough people disappoint her. Can I say something now? Buy you a beer? It's the least you could do. So, listen, uh, if I promise to step off your dad turf, will you please stop showing up at the radio events? Gladly. Gladly. It's big of you to come down here and admit you screwed up. And you, and you were right about Jones. Definitely bit me in the ass. Mm. Lux found out, huh? Yeah. Now she won't talk to me, she won't talk to Cate. I'd ask Math to help, but, uh... You think you could help a brother out? Hey. Ryan? Hey. What-What are you doing here? I'm just, uh, checking in on you. Wow. Nice shower curtain. You must be really angry at Cate to want to crash here. I've had worse. At least I don't have to deal with Cate's cooking. What, you don't miss waking up to the smell of burning bacon? Or burning oatmeal? You... You remember when she roasted a duck with the plastic bag of guts still in it? Another reason I don't eat meat. It looked like the guy from Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Yeah. So I hear you have, uh, been putting Baze through the wringer. He lied to me. Jones did, too. I felt so stupid. Bug may have not been perfect... but he never lied. He just yelled at you and took off. Look, Lux... maybe you should give some credit to the people that are here. If you want people to really get to know you like Bug did, and Tasha, you have to give them a chance. And you really think this guy Jones is only interested just because Baze asked him to be? I mean, no matter how screwed up the way they did it was, you have two guys in your life who went out of their way to make you happy. Two guys who really care about you. Three, actually. You okay? I've been better. I miss the smell of burning bacon, too. "Best wishes to the happy couple." Lux. I want to go back to before you knew me as Bong Girl, before Bug stole your car, before Baze told you whatever he told you to make you go out with me. He didn't make me do anything. Let me finish. I... want to get to know you. And I think you're someone I want to get to know me. So I want to start over. As friends. Friends. And how do we do that? Hi. Hi. Uh, I'm Jones. I'm Lux. www.addic7ed.com
