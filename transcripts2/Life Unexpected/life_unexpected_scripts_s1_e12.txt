 With her wedding on the horizon, Cate decides to take a road trip with Lux to find her father, Gordon, who abandoned her when she was a little girl.

 I lied. I don't have feelings for Cate. The fact that that was your go-to lie? There's probably more truth to it than you think. (Greg Holden's "the chase" playing) Ryan: I warned you. It's a mistake. Cate: No, it's not. It's eco-friendly. It's insane. It's green. It's insane! Look, evites are for... they're for barbecues. Or the Super bowl, okay? They are not for weddings.

 That are six days away! We're in a time crunch, remember? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Will you please just look at the upside? What? That our replies come with comments? (Chuckles) "Reply now or forever hold your peace." And for those of you who have yet to RSVP, it's an evite. It couldn't be easier. What's the holdup? Baze, aka Beerdrinkr420, I'm talking to you. Okay, well, that's, uh... that's it for us. Stay tuned now to "mix it up" with Jeff and Christy. It's looking like a great ride today, Portland.

 Baze: It's a yes or no question. Why can't I decide? I mean, I keep going back and forth. Yes, no, yes, no... All right. If I tell you something... you know, big dude to little dude... can you keep it on the dl? Sure. All right. You remember Cate's sister? She thinks that I have a thing for Cate. Which I don't. I mean, I know I don't, but she got this idea stuck in my head, and now I'm all screwed up. I mean, I don't know. Lately, whenever Cate's around, it's like she's changed her shampoo, or her dryer sheets, or something. (Sighs) Is it weird to want to smell someone? Yeah. See? And I don't... I don't want this feelings, you know? I don't want to do or say anything that is going to make it weird. 'Cause I've already messed her life up enough as it is. (Groans) I say keep your distance. At least until you figure things out. Lux: Are we done yet? No, we are done when we find my grandmother's brooch. It's my something old. So just keep looking. By the time we find it, everything will be old, including us. Oh, my God. What is this? Ooh, it's my old headgear. Just seeing it fills me with loneliness and self-hate. Who's Kirk Cameron? Hmm? Oh, he's an '80s tee idol turned born-again. Wasn't really that into him. Well, there's lipstick on the picture... Okay, enough. Just keep looking. The quicker we find the brooch, the sooner we're out of my mom's attic. What are these cards? Who's grant? Cate? Mom! Yo! Where's my money? Gav, what the hell? - Hey, you owe me. - Man, you need to back off. You steal my stash and sell it? Think I wouldn't notice? You bailed. You stuck me with the whole rent. Who screwed who? I need that money. Give me that money. Or I'll make you pay. You need to back off. (Grunts) (Grunts) (Clattering) Hey, hey! What is going on? (Coughing) Hey. You all right? Better get some ice on that. Wasn't that your friend, Bug? What was that? Just some guys from my past. Hey, listen to me. If you want to work here, they cannot be coming around. Do you understand me? So, if they're in the past, you got to keep them that way. Okay? Okay. I don't know why you're getting so upset, okay? So your father sent you some birthday cards. Big deal. No, it is a big deal. You know, you said that dad left you when I was six, and he never contacted us. This one is for my ninth birthday. This one is for my 11th. That's contacting us! Barely. No, you lied to me. Okay. Getting... getting those cards, it would, you know... It... it just would've given you false hope. That dad remembered my birthday every year? And he thought about me? That kind of false hope? I did what was best for you, okay? You did what was best for you. You... you always said that dad was a womanizer, you know, a slacker that couldn't hold down a job. That that was why he left. Did you lie about that, too? You did. The problem wasn't him. The problem was you. He left you. So, what, mom? Did you get back at him by keeping him away from us. You don't know him. (Chuckles) You're right. Thanks to you. Cate: Who knows what else she's hiding from me? What if he... he called or tried to visit? I mean, I never even called him back. He's your dad. I mean, nothing should've stopped him. Even your mom. Yeah. But what if she lied to him like she lied to me? Who knows? Okay, you know what? Don't let me talk about this anymore. I'm just going to focus on the wedding. You know what might calm you down? A seating chart. It says here your mom is a plus zero. So, is Carl coming or not? - I mean, what... - Not. She says weddings are a great place to meet men. My own father doesn't even know that I'm getting married. If Lux was getting married, and I didn't know, I'd kill myself. I will be sure to send you an invitation. I've spent 26 years wondering where my father is, and my mother knew that he was in Tahoe. I mean, do you know how close that is, in, like, comparison to the rest of the world? It's not too late to have a relationship. I mean, look at us. There are phones I. You know what? You're right. But I'm not gonna call him. Before we get married, I'm going to see him. I'm gonna see my dad. corrected by chamallow35 Transcript by addic7ed.com Okay, how bad... Is it? Bug? (Lux sighs) I know. It's payback from Gavin. Baze hasn't seen it, right? He's still in bed. He could sleep through a demolition derby. He said if they showed up again, I was done. Lux, I can't lose this job. I'm not going back to the guy who steals car radios and sells weed. - I need your help. - As soon as Cate's done with the show, we're taking off for Tahoe. Well, maybe you can buy me some time. Keep Baze away from the bar. Him and everyone else who works here? I mean, unless it's... it's closed down, someone is gonna see it. Think you could get him to close it down? You need me to what? Come with me and Cate on this road trip. Baze? On the road trip? Mm-hmm. Ryan can't go. He's got wedding stuff to do. And... and it'll be good to have another adult around. Sorry, kiddo. The less time I spend around Cate, the better. The last time we hung out, he used his fake feelings for me to dump my sister. Look, it's just that lately, we haven't had a lot of time together. Well, we can fix that. We'll make time. It's not that easy. I don't want Baze to think that just because you and Ryan are getting married, that he's not a part of my life anymore. Yeah, but Baze on the road trip? Cate and Ryan are getting married in six days. This is the last and first chance that... that we could actually do something as a family. A family road trip. I've never been on one, obviously, and it would mean... A lot to me. I'd have to ask Ryan. I'd have to shut the bar down for a day or two. And if he said that it was okay? I can't believe I'm saying this. If it's that important to you... Being a family? Mm-hmm? Then, yeah. Fine. I'm in. Baze can come. Ryan: Uh, you know, maybe I should come, after all. I mean, you... are you sure about this? No. You're helping me so much more by staying and dealing with wedding stuff. Thank you. Are you sure you just don't want to call him? I want to see my dad. Face to face. You know, it worked for Lux. And a wedding... I mean, it's the perfect excuse. You know, every girl pictures her father walking her down the aisle. I can barely picture my father. What's that? This is a way for you to become a better driver. It's got safety tips and everything. Help you steer clear of the flower pots. And I am making us a road mix. Got the, uh, monster ballads of the '80s. A little starship thrown in... (Imitates rocket blasting off) You owe me. - Yeah. Big time. - Ryan: Thanks, Baze. Just be careful. Hey, dude. You're staring. (Chuckles) So, I guess avoiding Cate's out the window. Big truck. Plenty of room. I'll be able to keep my distance. So, thank you for stepping up and looking after the bar. The guys are gone, so I really, you know... I appreciate you holding down the fort. Yeah, no. The closed sign's up. I'll take care of the beer guy. It's all good. Well, it means a lot to me. I really appreciate it. No worries. All right. Let's go! Come on, let's do this. Everybody in! Party truck out! Cate: Bye, bye. (Horn honking) Baze: Now, you may not know this, but starship used to be Jefferson airplane. Well, for cocktail hour, I'd like sliders. You know, those little mini burgers? Does anyone have to pee? Then they became Jefferson starship. ("Nothing's gonna stop us now" plays) You just went. And then finally, finally, they became... Let me guess. Starship? No, mini burgers. Could you just turn that noise down? Oh, this is not noise. This is art. How about mini lobster rolls? (Music stops) Oh, do you have those little wieners in the puff pastries? (Tires squeal) Did you see that possum? That little sucker came outta of nowhere. You made me drop my phone. (Sniffs) - Did you just sniff me? - What? No! I heard you. You just sniffed me. No, I smelled, um, I smelled feet, and I thought it was you. What? I don't smell like feet! You smell like feet! You just keep your distance, woman. You want me to keep my distance? Where you want me - to go, the trunk? - I don't have a trunk. Okay, okay, no one smells like feet, no one's going in the trunk. We're gonna find Cate's dad. So let's just... let's focus on that. Just focus on that. Okay. (Escape club's "wild, wild west" plays) (Truck horn beeping) (Laughs) Ooh, corn dogs! Cate: Oh, no, we're on a schedule. We're not stopping. Yes. We've taken a dozen pee breaks. We can take two minutes to enjoy some local cuisine. All right, one, two, three. Baze: Get in here! Come on! Do one with... All right, come on, come on, come on... Ready, ready, ready? I'll get in it... Ready? One, two, cheese! Cheese. (Horn honking) Baze: Come on, Cate! (Honking continues) (Tires screech) (Baze laughs) Come on! No, come on, seriously. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Seriously, com. We gotta go. (Baze laughing) Come on! Let's go! (Lux laughing) Lux: Go! Baze: When you're behind the wheel, you can't ford to let anything distract you: Cell phones, texting.... Cate: Can't you just go any faster? I'm not getting any service. Pushy passengers. You gotta keep your eyes on the road. Lux: Okay, I got it. When can I drive? Okay, you're clear. - Just pass the chicken truck. - Cate? I just have to call my florist before they close. Cate, relax. You're on a road trip. Can you put your phone away and just, like, be in the moment? Now remember, driving is a privilege. - It is not a right. - And just because my wedding isn't important to you doesn't mean that it isn't important to me. Why haven't you RSVP'd? What? You haven't? I have a scheduling conflict. Please, your life is like summer camp. I'm sure you can squeeze it in between, I don't know, canoeing and not bathing. Yeah, no, I've got the bar. I can't just shut it down. - Cate: Why? You shut it down for this road trip. - You know what? I'd be uncomfortable. Does Ryan even want me there? - Ryan is fine with you there. - You guys. (Horn honking) What is this really about? Bus! (Tires squealing) Okay, even though it appeared that I was distracted, I was still completely aware of my surroundings. (Gasps, tires screeching) (Hens clucking) All right, so if you get into a minor accident, what you want to do is exchange information. - And then... - Lux: You go for a hoagie? What? No. That's the wrong card. Then you call your friendly state farm dude. Then you go for a hoagie. All right, brother, what's the damages? Well, damage isn't so bad. But your radiator's punctured. We can patch it up for you, but it'll take till tomorrow... probably midday. No, no, no, no, no. We're supposed to be in Tahoe tonight. Yeah. That's not gonna happen. You know what? It's fine. I will find us a hotel. A warm bath, and a break here from toonces would be great. Yeah, good luck finding a room. Placer county toddler pageant's in town. Most places are booked up. Hey, you know what? This bed and breakfast... I dropped a customer off there earlier. They may have one room left. Well, they better have more than one. I mean, we can't all stay in one bedroom. Well, beats sleeping in your truck. (Sighs) (Cate gasps) All right, Lux is a kicker. - Scoot over. - (Mumbling): What? (Clears throat) What? She kicks. Uh... why don't... why don't I sleep on the floor? No, don't be ridiculous. It's freezing. No. See? A pillow wall. You won't even notice I'm here. I had fun today. I mean, besides the near-death experience with the chicken truck. Us spending time as a family. It's been nice. I have a confession to make. You know, part of the reason I'm so bang over about finding my dad? I see the relationship you have with Lux. I want that. I mean, she wanted you to come on this trip so badly. And I know that you've been wanting her to see you differently. I kinda do, too. See you differently. (Lightly snores) (Birds chirping) Oh, my God! What happened? - Uh... - Where is the pillow wall? It was made of pillows. It probably moved. Um, this is not good. The sharing of the bed, the face in my armpit. - It's weird. - Yeah. So, you and Lux should go see your dad. And I'm gonna... I'm gonna take a bus home. No, no, no, no! You... you can't go anywhere. We're... we're a family. We're gonna be miserable together as a family. This is definitely it. I don't know, maybe this wasn't a great idea. You know, Ryan was right. I shouldn't have just shown up like this. You don't have to do this if you don't want to. Can I help you? Hello? Catie. Grant: So, how... how are you? Good. Are... are you okay? Yeah... yeah, I'm good. - I'm good. - How's... how's your sister? - Abby's great. Yep. - Yeah? Yeah, um, I mean, a lot's happened. You know, since I've seen you last. But, um... I don't really know where to start. Um... (Laughs) Well, uh, I'm sorry. - Why don't we sit? - Okay. Um, yeah, you know, I quit piano. - You did? - Yeah, in the third grade. (Clears throat) Couch... Sit down. And, um, I had these... I had braces. It was kind of like a whole, like... kind of contraption. Cate, why don't you, uh, skip to the big stuff right. I was high school valedictorian. Terrific. Mm-hmm. And when I was 16 I had a kid. Your grandkid. Lux. Oh. With Baze. It's kind of a long story, but I gave her up. And, uh, this year, she... she came back and she found us. Isn't that something? Oh, and I'm getting married. Wow. That's... that is terrific. You know, Cate is a radio host. Baze: It's true. It's, uh... the show, it's a big deal. And she's huge. She's like a celebrity in Portland. You know, she, uh... she always was an overachiever. Even when she was little. - Really? - Oh, yeah. I told her mom that, uh, you know, one day... one day Catie was gonna take over the town. Sounds like you did. Cate: Speaking of mom, she's, um... she's kind of why I came. I found the birthday cards that you sent. She never gave 'em to me. And I always thought that you didn't want to be in touch with us, but, you know, now I know that you did. (Chuckles) - Well, I... I... I didn't know that she didn't give you the cards. - I know. I... I know. And... and, I mean, it changes everything. Um... There's just so much to talk about, you know... like all these years that we've missed. (Stammers) Would you like to have dinner tonight? - I mean, if you're free. If... - Sure. But why... why don't we fix something here? Um, you... you and... and... - Lux. - Lux. Lux. Oh... Yeah. You and Lux could do a grocery run and that way I could have a chance to get to know your fianc?e and we could have... Whoa, no, no. Baze, no uh, no. I will explain everything when the girls go shopping. Oh, great. Yeah. Okay. Good. You know, uh, did you see the grocery store coming in? Yeah. It's kind of on the way. Okay, we'll see you. Okay I know, huh? (Chuckling) It's something when they just show up on your doorstep like that. It kind of, uh... it's kind of nutty, right? (Water running) So, do you have any other kids besides Cate and Abby? No, two is plenty. I know how I felt when Lux showed up. I mean, it's like I missed so much. Her whole childhood. They're a lot of work when they're little. More than people tell you. That's lucky for you Cate' kind of past the diaper stage. Can I pour you one? Yeah. Here you go. Great. Um, to second chances. Mmm, this is delicious. Macaroni and cheese is kind of hard to screw up. You'd be surprised. Fine, I'm not much of a cook. I get it from mom. You always wanna have one or two dishes up your sleeve. Best way to a man's heart is through his stomach, right? Oh, it's no wonder you left. (Baze laughing) So, um, this Ryan, right? Ryan. It's the guy you're marrying, right? - Mm-hmm, Ryan. - Sounds like a great guy. He is, he's really, he's really great. Yeah, wish you could meet him. You could, you know, meet him. I mean, I know this is gonna sound like a really crazy idea, but you could come to Portland, hang out for a few days, and come to the wedding. Uh, I don't know. Oh, are you worried about mom? Because don't be. She will get over it. - Cate, um... - Dad. Look, I've always acted like not having a father wasn't a big deal. But it was. There hasn't been one important moment in my life where I haven't imagined what you would say or do. My graduation, um, the first day on the radio. The day I had Lux. I'm getting married, and it would just mean the world to me if this one time if I didn't have to imagine... If you were actually there. Wow. What kind of a dad would I b if I said no to that? (Crickets chirping) Ooh! It might just be us and starship driving back to Portland. Cate's making plans with grant to meet up in the morning - to drive back with him. - We'll see. What? I get a bad vibe off that guy. I mean, hell, I used to be that guy. And he doesn't wanna be a father, and I feel like Cate should know. If you butt in, if you say something that she doesn't wanna hear the person Cate will be mad at isn't gonna be her dad. It'll be you. Anyway, Ryan, I just, I can't wait for you to meet him. You know, I want to, um, I want to change the place cards. I wanna put my dad at our table. I know, you know, I'm actually thinking that tomorrow. Yeah, tomorrow I'm gonna ask him to walk me down the aisle. You know what? My battery's dying. I'll call you in the morning. I love you, too. Okay, bye. (Hangs up) Wow. Walking you down the aisle. It's happening pretty fast. Did I take my phone charger? You know, we had an interesting conversation, me and your dad. I left it right here. Where... It kind of reminded me of me when Lux showed up, you know? Freaked out by the dad thing. What? Look, uh... you know what? Um, I don't know, never mind. I'm staying out of it. Okay, well, you're obviously not, if you're bringing it up. You don't even know what you're talking about. Then let's not talk. If my dad was so freaked out, how come he's coming back to Portland with me? I don't know, maybe the same reason that he sent all those cards... not to feel like a bad guy. God, why, why are you doing this? Why are you trying to mess things up? Look, Cate, I know that this is the last thing that you want to hear, but I'm looking out for you. By what, telling me that my father is gonna disappoint me and let me down? The only person in my life that consistently lets me down is you. You know what, you can blame me all you want for not being there, but I am here now. And if you took Lux from me tomorrow, I would not eat, I would not sleep until I found her. So what is your father's excuse for staying away? I am trying to warn you, Cate, that you may be looking for something that's not there. Get out of here. Get out! Bug: Lux, I'm gonna need more time. What do you mean? You're not done? The graffiti, I mean, it's everywhere. I've tried everything. The dude at the hardware store thinks I need to rent a sandblaster. I need more time. Oh, I gotta call you back. - Baze? - You were right, Lux. I should've kept my mouth shut. You know what, I thought that I was doing the right thing. But to Cate, I will always be the guy who left. You know what? Um, you should go with Cate when grant picks her up tomorrow because I, I just, I gotta, I gotta get going tonight. I'm sorry. Wait, no, no, no, you can't go. I'm sorry, kiddo. I don't mean to ruin a family trip. I just... I, um, I will make it up to you. That's not it at all. Oh, you're gonna find out, anyway. I might as well tell you. The bar's been trashed. - What? - They did it to screw with Bug... that's why I asked you to come on this trip. Bug, he wanted to repair the damage before you saw it. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you. (Chuckles) No. This is good. 'Cause here I was feeling guilty that I'd ruined this family thing, but it turns out that that's not what this trip was about for you, anyway. (Engine starts) (Birds chirping) Cate: Hey, dad, so, I just wanted to let you know that we're still waiting. Left you a couple of messages. I hope everything's okay. Um, call m my cell when you get this. I left you the number. Okay, bye. He's... he's not picking up on his cell or at home. What... what if he got into an accident or something? Oh, do you think that maybe I should call the hospital? I'd hold off. Hi, are you Cate Cassidy? Oh, uh, yes, I am. Your father just called. He... he called the front desk? Uh-huh, he said he can't make it. Something came up last minute. Fishing, huh? Is that what came up? (Sighing): Cate... Look, I'm sorry. You're sorry that catching a fish is more important than walking your daughter down the aisle? No, no, I'm sorry because I can't be who you want me to be. No, it's not who I want you to be. You are my dad. It's who you are. When Lux came back, I was really scared that I was not gonna be the perfect mom. That she was gonna have all of these expectations for me, but she didn't... I mean, she doesn't. All she wants me to be is exactly what I am... her mom. All I really want you to be is my dad. But you don't want to be, do you? You don't want to be my dad. Look... I married your mom because she was pregnant. We had Abby because she thought it might save the marriage, but it didn't. Being a husband and a father... never being free to do what I want... (Mutters) I love you, Cate, I do. But you're looking for something in me that I just can't give you. It wasn't the life I wanted then, and it's... it's not what I want now. Hmm. All this time, I have been blaming Baze. Like he's the only one that left me. I thought he was the one that wrecked me. You were. Lux: Oh. You're here. I never left. I slept in my truck. I couldn't leave Lux or you. It's okay, Cate. (Cate sobs) It's okay. (Starship's "nothing's gonna stop us now" plays) We should talk. About the bar... Bug... We'll deal with us later. Right now? This is Cate's favorite. * and we can build this dream together * Both: * standing strong forever * * nothing's gonna stop us now * * and if this world runs out of lovers * * we'll still have each other * * nothing's gonna stop us * * nothing's gonna stop us now * * whoa! Whoa! * * and we can build this dream together * * standing strong forever * * nothing's gonna stop us now * * nothing's gonna stop us * * and if this world runs out of lovers * * we'll still have each other * * nothing's gonna stop us * * nothing's gonna stop us! * (indistinct voices) (Clears throat) Will you grab my red bag? Yeah. (Women humming) (Laughter) (Sighs) Okay. Here we go. (Sighs) Ladies... (Sighs) Oh, I think I dropped the dog part of my corndog. I'm gonna get that, before a raccoon does.  Hey, Baze? - Yeah? - Look, I'm sorry. You know, for so long I took out everything I felt about my dad on you, and... It's not fair. Thank you for trying to warn me and being honest with me. I always want you to tell me the truth. You know, even if I don't want to hear it. Thank you. For being there. Always. Hey. Hi. (Kissing) Ryan: Here. I'll take those, Baze. - Thanks. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right. Good trip. Oh, um, maybe I'll go back to the loft with you. If you're gonna talk to Bug, I want to be there. Cate: You know, and I used to make up all of these reasons for why he wasn't around. That he got, you know, kidnapped by... (Laughs) Pirates or communists, his secretary. I just think deep down, I always blamed you. Well, I let you think he wanted to leave me, 'cause I never wanted you and Abby to know he wanted... to leave you, too. Were you ever going to tell us the truth? You know, that he just didn't want to be a dad? I... I meant to, you know. Yeah. I mean, when you... when you got older. I thought it would hurt less then. But then I realized, you're never old enough for that to hurt less. I mean, however old you and Abby got, you were always gonna want a father who... Who wanted you. I wanted him to walk me down the aisle. Oh. And I was going to ask him. But I... I... it really should be somebody who... Somebody who cares about me. Someone who's here for me now. Sweetie, I'm not sure if Kirk Cameron's gonna be available on such short notice. Will you walk me down the aisle? (Sighs) (Laughing) Well, we're making progress on the graffiti. Instead of "asswipe," it says "ass." Is that an improvement? Hmm. Uh, Baze, I just wanted to say I'm sorry again. See you tomorrow. Wait. You're not firing me? (Laughs) Look, I don't want to be punished for who I was in the past. And I'm not gonna punish you, either. We're just a couple of dudes trying to change, right? (Sighs) I owe you. Big time. (Laughs) For what it's worth, you have changed. Cate sees it, and so do I. You know, the more dads I get to know... yours, Cate's... you're a really good one. Hmm. (Laughs) How long has it been? (Sniffles) How long... how long has what been? Since you've had feelings for Cate? (Laughs) I just... I thought that if I gave it time, the feelings would go away, but after the last two days, I don't know if I want the feelings to go away. We felt like a family, the three of us, for the first time. It felt really good. To me, too. Baze? I'm ready. (Graham Colton's "love comes back around" plays) You know the papers that you gave me after the meeting with fern? You told me to tell you when I was ready for you to be my parents, officially. And I am. I'm ready. Because of something that I realized while we were on the trip. That you love starship? (Laughs) That I love you. Both of you. Mmm. I love you too. (Relieved laughter) (Sighs) corrected by chamallow35 Transcript by addic7ed. Com www.tvsubtitles.net
