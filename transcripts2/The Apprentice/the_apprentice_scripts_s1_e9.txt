 [Trump] Previously on The Apprentice, the candidates set out to sell the latest Trump venture. I've decided to open up a water distribution company. [Ereka] Trump Ice! - That's a lot of Trump Ice. - [ Trump ] Even though Heidi's mother was diagnosed with cancer, Heidi's courage inspired Protégé. - [Amy ]I think we need to dedicate our effort and task tomorrow to your mom. - Aw, thank you. [Trump] And Omarosa continued working despite being bumped on the head. - How's your noggin? - I'm actually used to the pain now. -1 think I've been a trouper throughout the situation. - [ Trump ] At Versacorp, project manager Freka fell apart in front of Carolyn.

 - [ Bill ] Ereka had a slight problem with organizing the papers. - [Ereka ] I'm really upset, guys. She was extremely flustered, just panicking. She did it in front of Carolyn, which I think was not a smooth move. -[Trump] And Versacorp came up short. - Carolyn? Well, I'm afraid our group didn't do as well. [ Trump ] Ereka was honest with Nick and Bill about who she would take into the boardroom. I'm taking you and Bill. It's not personal. - 1t's not anything. - Just because you preface something and say it's not personal, doesn't mean it isn't. -[Trump] And the men stuck together. - Who would you fire of the two, Bill? My problem with Ereka was that many of my ideas were dismissed. - You think Ereka should be fired. - Yes, I do. - Who do you think, Nick, did the worst job? - Ereka. [Trump] Ereka, you never had a strong game plan. You were frantic under pressure. - Don't say it, Mr. Trump. - You're fired. [Trump] Eight candidates are left. Who will be fired this week?

Bad? Good? Why do you look pissed? - [ Kwame ] It didn't go well? - [ Katrina ] I supported Freka against the guys, and the guys then turned on us, and it was, like-- [Kwame ] So it was guys versus girls? - [Heidi] I dor't think it'l] be Freka. -1 really, really don't think so. That was a bad move. She probably should've brought just me and Katrina in there. Probably would've worked out better, you know? I don't think Nick gave Ereka enough credit, and I don't think Bill gave Ereka enough credit. [ Omarosa Screeches ] What are you guys doin'? Where did she go? She's gone. Oh, my God! She's gone! [Troy] Gentlemen. - [ Heidi] Oh, my God. Oh, my God. - [ Kwame] Ohh. Oh! [Kwame ] Into the woods. The game has just changed significantly. [ Troy ] There you go. [Katrina ] 1 think Omarosa's quite happy now because Freka's gone, which makes me sick to my stomach considering Omarosa should be the one gone. [Kwame ] Wow. Whoa, baby! - [ All Chattering ] - [ Heidi ] How was she when she got-- Was she okay? It was not pleasant, that's for sure. It wasn't pleasant? It was bad. It was bad. She wouldn't shake our hands when she left. [ Kwame ] Oh, that's not good. Ereka was one person that I stood by because I believed in what she stood for. Now it's really all about the game and the job. I told her. I was like, “Freka, take me in with you. Take me in with you. Take me in with you.” [ Nick ] If she would've taken you in, 1 would've been fired. [Bill] Yep. One hundred percent. I"m a little annoyed she didn't shake Bill's hand. Me-- 1 don't care. But Bill's a nice guy. She wouldn't shake my hand. [ Phone Ringing ] [ Ringing Continues ] Hi. It's Mr. Trump's office. He wants you to meet him... on the steps of the Metropolitan Museum in one hour. Thank you. Okay. We're gonna start by evening out the teams. Versacorp, you people have gotten clobbered, so that means you're gonna have to make a choice. You're gonna have to choose somebody from Protégé. Who's your team captain? - All right. Nick, again-- You're gonna have to start winning, Nick. - I know. -[Trump] Your're losin' a lot. -1 know. - All right. Who do you choose? - We're gonna take Amy. [Bill] Welcome home. [Omarosa] Bye, honey. -[Amy] Bye. - Don't you think you're giving Amy a little too much power? - Absolutely. - would've never chosen Amy-- ever. Maybe what you're telling me Is I should just give her the job right now? [ Think you made a mistake, but if you wanna take Amy, that's okay with me. Now, behind me is one of the great institutions of the world, the Metropolitan Museum of Art. You're gonna be given a choice from a group... of young, emerging, brilliant artists. Each team is gonna choose an artist. You're then gonna take this artist to a gallery in Manhattan, and you're gonna sell his paintings. And, as always, George and Carolyn will be observing you throughout the task. The team that comes up with the most money for the art wins. This is a tough one, because what makes good art Is entirely subjective. There is no set market value, so you really need to think this one through. Good luck. [Kwame ] 1 was nominated the night before to be project manager, and so I knew the challenge was gonna be very different because art is very subjective, and it's not something that you can kind of push as a normal product. And it's gonna be all about, really, which artist we choose. [ Heidi ] Hi. [ Troy] Hi, I'm Troy, and what was your name? Giles. I'm Omarosa. When we walked into Giles's, I thought, “Okay. Here's this quintessential New York artist... with splatter against the wall, and he calls it art,” but this guy had a different edge. Yeah, you know, I don't normally allow this, but if you get up close and touch it-- particularly here, for example-- if you run your finger over this-- these mounds start out as hair in my paint. If you run your finger-- [ Omarosa ] He wanted to insert his D.N.A. into each of his pieces, so essentially, he's, like, shaven under his arms and his legs... and put hair droppings and toenail clippings in his artwork. - Every painting is authenticated by genetic materials, and it's just-- - What is this clear? [Omarosa] I've been here for 10 minutes, and I've already connected with your work. - Well, you know-- - [Kkwame] You got to touch his work. I got to touch his work. Check, please. Would I choose to work with Omarosa in the real world? Absolutely not. I don't agree with her style. She doesn't agree with my style. 1 don"t like her technigue. Some people might find it offensive. 1, for one, was like, “Oh, my God.” [Jackhammer Pounding ] Andrei? Yeah. Hi. I'm Katrina. Pleasure to meet you. How are you? From the minute I walked in, I knew that Andrei was the man, and I really... felt strongly about him and his work. I'm a nature-based abstract painter. Sometimes the background could look like the inside of an old cave-- [ Nick ] Right. And on top of it, some really gestural effects. What we liked was he was very sincere. He has beautiful artwork. And he was explaining it to me, who doesn't know much about art, and I think that would be a real selling point. I'm not using any trickery. I'm using good old paint, and I'm weaving a story with it-- [ Nick ] Gotcha. In avery intelligent, sophisticated way. [ Nick ]1like it. [Katrina ] 1 love it. [ Nick] 1 like the way you explain it. That's phenomenal. [ Bill ] The next artist we saw was Leah, a cute little Italian girl who lived in Brooklyn, worked out of her house. - Nice to meet you. Come onin. - Basically, she painted snapshots of her life. - [Amy] Ooh, I love it already. - For people who don't know so much about art, it's-- you know, they can easily relate to the photograph. You look at it and you like it, or you don't. I personally loved Leah's work. I thought it was fun, and I thought that she'd be successful, I love it. Hi. Nice to meet ya. [Troy] This is beautiful. [Heidi] Troy, here you go. When we first walked in to Meghan's, I was so excited, I mean, I thought her apartment was amazing. She seemed passionate. I mean, she seemed a little creepy. [Meghan] This is a series called Psyche and Smut, - and it's about a young girl, Psyche, and her twin sister, Smut. - Huh. [Meghan] And Psyche is this very prim and proper pinafore little girl, and Smut is this rather aberrant, naughty little girl. And by the way, the city's ruled by frogs and their concubines. She has a lot of different genre... and has this weird kind of theme goin'on. I don't know if our customers'll like it, but I'll tell you what-- she's a home run hit, because her average price per item is 4,000 bucks, where everybody else's average price is only 1,500 bucks. [Kwame ] Meghan, what's the average price point of one of your pieces? [Meghan] 1 would say about 4,000. [ Kwame ] What we liked about Meghan was-- Meghan's got 20 pieces. We knew her work was extreme. We knew it was risqué. But we looked at her price points and ability to deliver. If we sell three to four of Meghan's work, we're gonna win this easily. - [ Kwame ] And the price point on these? - [Meghan ] These are 7,000. [ Kwame ] Okay. [ Heidi ] These are great. [Trump] You've gotta believe in what you're selling. If you don't believe it-- If you don't really believe it yourself, it'll never work. It'll never sell, and you're gonna be miserable. [Kwame ] It comes down to Meghan and Leah. Five minutes, we need to make a decision. All right, so let's just discuss. [ Omarosa ] Go ahead. I think Meghan has her-- [ Beeps ] together. She's weird as hell, but I'm not an artist aficionado, so [ don't really care about that. She's risky. If she can get the people out she says that she can get out and we can get more-- If she doesn't, we're gonna be-- We're gonna be at zero. We're screwed. [ Kwame ] I didn't come on this game to be practical. I had a nice job on Wall Street, an easy life. But I said I had my whole life to be ordinary and wanted a chance to be extraordinary. [ Took the same philosophy when it came to being project manager on this task... and making the critical decision as to which artist we were gonna go with. You're absolutely right. We would be taking a calculated risk. I'll take two positions. The first: I have some concerns about going with Meghan. -1 will tell you that. The medieval artwork is-- - [Kwame ] Her stuff is weird, [ could never explain it. You're right. You're right. From the art perspective-- I'm Just giving you the art perspective-- you all can do the numbers-- 1 have big concerns with Meghan. Leah-- love her. She's got a great product. She's got something that's whimsical. That's from an artistic perspective. [ Heidi ] You cannot look at this task in an artistic way. If you do, you're screwed, You have to look at this as a business task, and to be honest, I don't think Mr. Trump gives a rat's ass about the art. He wants to see who can make the most money, and that's what we do. You asked me to be the art expert. [Kwame ] All right. Go ahead, Now, let me flip to the business side. I had to break it down that way. Tomorrow, Meghan's the only one who's gonna drive in the numbers we need to win. [ Heidi ] Exactly. - That's my whole spiel. - Good spiel. - Good spiel. - [Omarosa ] Kwame wanted to take this major risk, and this was just not the task to do it. The art world is very finicky, and I informed him of that. - Because art is all about risk. Artis all about risk. - [ Troy ] I'm just kiddin'. - [ Kwame ] We are officially selecting Meghan. Let's take a risk. - We gotta break Amy's luck. Risk on three. [All] One, two, three. Risk! [ Kwame] We're gonna take a risk. Let's do it. I'm gonna sell the frog smoking opium. - [Katrina ] Andrei's established. He has a client base. -[Bill] He does. He has two pieces that are practically already sold. He's been in New York for 35 some-odd-- [ Phone Beeps ] - Here they are. - [Nick ] So it's between Andrei and Leah. What do you say? I mean, they're two totally different artists. Leah's stuff-- It's paintings of her and her friends at the beach... and at picnics and-- [ Beeps ] like that. - It's pretty unique. - Bill and Amy wanted Leah, and I didn't get to see her work, and, quite frankly, just from hearing about it, I didn't think it was the way to go. This is a critical decision we're making here. [ Nick ] We need to make a decision. Amy, what do you say? [ Katrina Over Phone] We're on 10th Avenue. I support the team, but I think I'd go with Leah. I'll call you right back. I'm making an executive decision at this point. I think Andrei's the man, and either we knock the cover off the ball or we strike out. [ On Phone] It's Nick. All right, Nick. What's goin' on? - I already made a decision. It's Andrei. - What? I said I already made the decision, and I'm gonna go with Andrei. -1 think it's a good move. - Wait. Can we pick Leah, oris it too late to pick Leah? No. It's too late. It's done. [ Think it's important to choose a good artist. In my opinion, that was a very critical decision to be made. But Nick made an executive decision to go with Andrei, and we had to stick with it. Yeah, I just have a sick pit in my stomach,'cause 'm not feeling really comfortable... with the decision. Hi. How are you? Hello. How are you? [ Heidi] How are you? [Omarosa ] Team Protégé was up around 7:00 this morning. Kwame and Troy were going to head out handing out invitations. Heidi and I had the task of working with the artist at the gallery... so that we can hang her art and make the exhibit a success. Okay. So should we get goin'? Unpack the work? - Yeah. Let's get goin'. - [ Omarosa] Heidi, it's George. Meghan Boody. Okay. So how did you pick out this artist? [Omarosa] Our thought is that she had an extensive following already, and we needed to build a crowd that would be more likely to purchase her art. And she has just been so cooperative, and that's why we selected her. Yeah. [ Think art s a business. And art is very subjective. Omarosa characterized the art she picked out as somewhat provocative, which is really a gamble, one way or the other, but it's a business gamble. [ Heidi] Thank you for stoppin' by, George. [ George ] We'll see you later. See you later. These two faces with the blood dripping down-- What's that supposed to represent? It's about reconciling oneself with that dark territory... and align yourself with it, because once you finally harness those forces, then you're stronger. Okay. [ Heidi ]I asked Meghan about the artwork. I wanted to know the story behind it, because you need to know the product before you sell it. [ Heidi] 1/ had some crazy nightmares [last night. I'm like, “What the hey?” They were weird. And now I'm just remembering-- the artwork. Her artwork is-- Her artwork is freaky. It's weird, but you know what? 'M just gonna sell it and will learn to like it. [Heidi] Bye, Meghan. We'll see you later. [Omarosa] Bye. Bye, Arthur. Thank you. Thank you. My head is killing me. I've gotta eat something. The thing is, I can't wait for 20 minutes. My head is killing me right now. All right. Um, you wanna grab a sandwich right there at the vending? [ Phone Ringing ] Hey, Kwame. We don't have time to sit down for two hours. No. I'd like to sit down, if that's okay. We do have time. [ Heidi On Phone ] We have to market. I mean, if you wanna-- Omarosa? Then tell Kwame, but we're not gonna have time. I can't run like this with a concussion. [ Kwame] Hello? I need to take my time and take care of myself. Well,sodo . I mean, this is ridiculous. [ Heidi ] She always has a headache when it's a task time, but when it's reward time, she never has a headache. - She's an absolute lunatic bitch. - [ Omarosa] Heidi doesn't wanna stop and eat, and I need to sit down. - You guys figure out the eating thing, and we'll move forward. - [Omarosa Laughing Over Phone ] - [Omarosa ] I think you're being really rude, Heidli. - I'm not being-- [ Beeps ] rude. You always have to sit down. Don't curse at me. You can curse at other people. Don't curse at me. What are you gonna do about it? What are you gonna do about it? Don't be childish. Oh, you're childish. I don't have to sit down with you at all and try to play the game. Whatever. You don't scare me, Omarosa. I could give two--[ Beeps ] about you. Heidi has a trash mouth, and 1 just was not going to be on the receiving end of it. And I made it very clear to her she needed to clean up her act and shut her mouth. You can go wherever the-- [ Beeps ] you want. I can't-- [ Beeps ] stand you. [ Beeps] You whine and complain. Bitch, bitch, bitch. I don't really take anything that Heidi says to heart at all. I mean, look at the source. [Kwame ] All right. Thanks, Omarosa. Talk to you later. “My head. I wanna eat.” [ Troy Laughs] “Dude, it's my head, and if I don't get some catered service pretty quick-- Al right. 'm callin' the president” [ Troy ] Heidi and Omarosa are never gonna change. Heidi doesn't gel well with Omarosa, and Omarosa doesn't wanna put forth the effort. It keeps the team on an emotional roller coaster. [ Distant Chatter] [ Nick ] Give me a sip of one of those. I need to take the edge off. [ Bill ] 6:00 to 7:00, Amy and I are gonna do greeting, food and beverage. [ Nick ] Right. [ Bill ] It's pretty limited-- who's gonna come in and actually buy. Your're talking about getting someone to come in here and spend $4,000 onapainting. There aren't too many people I know that shell out that kind of money on paintings. I certainly don't. - [ Nick ] Come on, baby. Let them come. - [ Bill] They say the first hour is always slow. 'M worried. Should I change my shirt to black? You think that makes a difference? No.? Even when things look like they're in shambles, you can never, ever let anybody see that you're concerned, because once they see the leader-- the head of the thing's-- cracking, they no longer believe. We'll be all right. Yeah? I think we'll be all right. [ Bill ] Two things I wanna let you know about tonight. One: It's studio pricing. - And-- second thing-- he will hang the artwork and light it for you. - [Woman ] I know. You said so. So what is your price range? I didn't think, but I would love to own one of his pieces. Okay. Well, number one-- Let's go to number one. 1 went over to this young lady, and she really liked the personal attention, bought the painting on the spot. You got a deal, Let's shake on it. Absolutely. Very nice to meet you. I'll write this up right now. - [Woman ] Please do. - Once they sold that painting, I knew it was gonna be a great night. I want you to buy me that one. I want you to buy me that one. You wanna buy me the one I want? Uh-oh. - Buy the painting tonight. Buy the painting tonight. - [Amy ] If you're ever considering... buying a piece, I think tonight's the night. You know what? I sold your painting. [ Man ] You did? You-- Yeah. [ told you it was gonna move. Dawn, number 11. Ten percent discount. Great job, man. 'm really happy for you. I'm very happy for you. This whole competition Is not about marketing. It's not about real estate backgrounds. It's not about M.B.A's. It's about leading people. Why do employees come to work every day? Because they believe in something. I bring energy, enthusiasm... and a sense that everything is gonna be okay and that we're gonna win. [ Chattering ] [Troy] Welcome to Meghan Boody's show. [ Heidi ] Hi. 'm Heidi. Pleased to meet you. Pleased to meet you as well. - Thanks for comin' out tonight. - [ All Chuckling ] I"m learning this. Look at that. Omarosa showed me that. [Indistinct Chatter] [Omarosa] Everything fell into place at the gallery. And we're very excited. Everything looks fabulous, and I feel very confident we're gonna sell lots of art today. Again, her thought process is far beyond my comprehension. Just the little “induendos”-- the snake in the grass over there. The skull of Henry VI, I mean, she is amazing. [ Heidi ] Okay. [Troy] Art. I mean, if you wanna hit me in my weak spot, you found my Achilles' heel, because this old kid doesn't know nothin' about art-- not a darn thing. [Troy] You know what that picture is-- What it is is everybody wants avirgin outside of the bedroom; everybody wants a whore inside. - Ah, yes! - That is what I see. Ah, what a wonderful dichotomy. That is fantastic. Oh, man. I'm seeing-- 'm seeing the genius in her. Okay. [Omarosa] Troy and Heidi really are not into art, and it's kind of funny... to hear them talk about it because they really have no appreciation for this particular genre, and so they seem to be fish out of water. [ Heidi ] You know what? Really, what I love about her artwork... is she takes a picture, and then it's all digitalized. So it's really, like, unique artwork. It's not your typical painting. Right. Did you see that? I have to show you those. Which one? No, I didn't. Okay. You ready? Someone comes into your house. You got a toilet tank here. What do you do? [Heidi] It's kind of cool. It's different. [Woman] Yeah. So you're supposed to put this over a toilet? Oh--no. Artis-It's all subjective. It's how you see it. This is a cast-iron fireplace cover. [ Heidi ] So what? I made a mistake. 1 didm't know. I'm gonna sell it as a toilet bowl. It looked like a damn toilet bowl to me. I've messed up on some pictures. I messed up on the toilet seat, but, hell, that looked like a damn toilet seat if I ever saw one. - [Heidi I ?/a'/ ] Troy? This is some hard work to sell. What's that? Did you sell anything? No, dude. This is the hardest-- [ Beeps ] sell. This is the hardest-- [ Beeps ] sell I've ever had in my life. Dude, I go in for-—- The biggest complaint-- I go in for the close, and it's like-- I"m trying to sell this, and I'm doing my damnedest, and this lady who put up her art gallery for us to use-- Madalyn-- she said it the best. You guys have MB.As or whatever, and she's an artist. This is a gallery. Mm-hmm. - There needs to be some more communication in how you guys operate. - Okay. Communicate more. Okay. 'M keepin the faith. We have another two and a half hours, and hopefully we have some people who are gettin' more and more interested, and hopefully we can sell a few of these big pieces. I think it only takes two to three pieces for us to win. It's very different art. It's very esoteric. It's very tailored to a different set-- you know, very small group of people. I took my time, and I did what people do in art galleries: I allowed the patron to explore the piece... and to express to me their interest, and once they'd expressed their interest, that's when I zeroed in on the sell, The only thing we have that's not even provocative is-- is a picture of a cat or a picture of a little girl standing alone. - This one-- - Essentially, we introduced her... to a piece called “The Hollowed Pussy.” [ Meghan] I actually photographed this... in a taxidermist studio in Paris. It's not quite clear if this is an undead kitty or not. It went for $869. Thank you very much. You're welcome. - I enjoyed meeting you. Appreciate that. - Thank you so much. You're welcome. [Kwame ] Thank you. I hope we can sell one more piece, "cause $869 is cuttin' it close, given that the other team probably played more of a volume game. So we'll see. We'll see. It's on the edge. - How you doing, folks? - Good morning. [Trump] So before we hear the results, I have a few questions to ask. - Who chose the artist on the two teams? Who was responsible, primarily? - [ Nick ] We went to see a few artists, and then in the end, we were pressed for a decision, so I made a decision. - We were torn between-- - [ George ] Who's the “we”? Who was against you? Oh, no. Nobody was really against me. 1 was particularly fond of one artist and decided we were gonna go with him. I was for Leah initially, as well as Bill, - but as soon as we made the decision, we were ready fo go with Andrei. - Were you happy with your artist? Yes. Extremely happy. Extremely. - Good talent? - Amazing. - Talent or salesmanship? What do you think? - Both. [Trump] Nick, you went against the advice of your team and went with your gut. Let's see if it paid off. Kwame, who picked your artist? We chose our artist as a team. We came down to a vote. - We actually went with a high-risk artist with a high price point. - Why did you choose the artist? We decided that-- because of our limited knowledge in the art world-- her average price point was higher than all the rest of the artists, so we looked at it from a pure numbers standpoint. Okay. Kwame, were you happy with the artist? We actually really never liked the artist's work, but we felt that the artist... had a ready-made fan following that she could turn out quickly, that she could just turn the switch. - Did you like the artist? Heidi? - Her artwork? I wasn't particularly fond of it. All right. Carolyn, what are the numbers? It looks like Versacorp, which is Nick's group, sold $13,600, and they sold eight pieces. -1 thinkit's the first time I saw Nick smile. - [Troy Laughs ] - Go ahead. George. - Uh, Protégé sold one piece for $869. Wow. That's awful. - That's getting creamed. - Yes, itis. They loved their product. They loved their artist. They loved everything they were doing. And they killed you. You tried to sell something that you didn't believe in. You didn't like your product, and you'll never be successful selling a product that you don't like and don't believe in. And that was your biggest mistake. All right. Nick, as project manager of the winning team, this is your chance to impress me one-on-one. So as a reward, you have 10 minutes with me. You know, a lot of people would like that opportunity, so take advantage of it. Protégé, I'll see you back at the boardroom, folks, where somebody has to get fired. Hello. I have an appointment with Mr. Trump. [ Nick] 1 knew I needed to win, otherwise, I would've been fired. I was the project manager. I needed to make a decision, and I stuck with my gut and chose Andrei... and it wound up being the right one. Mr. Trump, how are you? Come on in, Nick. Come on in. Sit over here, Nick. This is beautiful. Oh, my goodness. This is beautiful. [ Nick ] Basically, what I wanted to do in that meeting with Mr. Trump... was just ask him, “What do you see or what are you looking for in a young executive coming up?” Well, it's energy-- I mean, assuming the brain. Number one is the brain. But you need the energy. If you don't have the energy, forget it. Now, you have energy. You have a lot of energy. Uh-huh. It's an honor. Can-- Can we-- Yeah. Come on. Let me show you around a little. Mr. Trump, do you have a mentor that you learned from-- Was there a few people, oris it just one? To me, my father was my mentor. I mean, I learned more from my father than anybody else. Okay. See, these are pictures. This is a picture of my mother in her last years. This is my father in his prime. Great people. [ Nick ] He stressed the importance of the relationship with his mom and dad. Without a good support system and a close family, you really-- you can't do anything. I think there's a connection. [ think he can see me running one of his organizations. You just keep it goin'. I will. You just keep it goin'. You're doin' well. Even when you in theory weren't doing well, I thought you were doing well. - Thank you. -1 think you have a certain spirit. - Thank you. - Regardless of how this turns out, [ think you're gonna be very successful, [ Nick] The main goal is to be workin' for you. You have fun. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Very nice to meet with you. [ Heidi] Hey, Mom. How you doin'? I know. I figured you would need treatment. Just-- You know, the next year's gonna be rough for you. Are the doctors optimistic? Are the doctors optimistic? [ Heidi] My mom is doing well-- knock on wood, She's still in the hospital now, and they're just doing extra tests on Tuesday. I know. I just hope that-- You are at the best doctor, right? Are you with the best doctor? [ Heidi] 1 mean, definitely the game has changed. I wanna do this for my mom. That's why I say I'm not compromising my ethics or values on this. I love you, love you, love you. I know. I'll do anything for you. All right. Love you. Bye. Okay. Bill, I'm off. Kwame is absolutely taking me to the boardroom. I'm prepared. If he takes me, he takes me. I think he'll take me and Troy. I truly do. Or, for strategic reasons, he might pin me and Omarosa against each other. I always like watching Troy go from one person to the next. He couldn't stand Heidi two tasks ago. Now they're best friends. Yesterday, Kwame and / worked very closely together. He insisted on doing something with Kwame. But he offered nothing. Do you understand? All he did was carry alcohol into the gallery. That's it. I dor't know what significant contribution Troy made to this task. I mean, he helped carry liquor into the gallery and mopped the floor afterwards. -1 don't know how that leads to avictory. -1 was finance manager. I was the art advisor. I got the caterer. [ Omarosa ] Kwame will not take me to the boardroom... because I was his artistic advisor on this task. He did not go with the artist I selected. He went with what Troy and Heidi wanted to do. I'm always nominated by default. [ Katrina ] Just because you're nominated doesn't mean you're going. I think if I was the project manager and we lost, I think I'd have to nominate myself... just because I'd have to be consistent. [Omarosa] Just for the strength of the team, I'd like to see Heidi go, plus I'm tired of hearing her say that she'd rather sell Tampax than artwork. She's pretty much supporting my theory that she's the least classiest person in this game. Kwame could take me, but if he does, I'm gonna have to eat my “brotha” up. [ Omarosa ] Kwame's gonna have to assess everyone's role in this particular task and make the decision. I just hope he does not choose me, because I am ready to go into that boardroom fighting. I'm not bulletproof, but I'm preparing. That's what I"m sitting over here doing. He can take me in if he wants to. [ Elevator Bell Dings ] Well, we've had some disasters, but this is the worst. Fight hundred dollars versus over $13,000. So that's called a defeat. There's no doubt about it. - Kwame, you're the captain. What happened? - We basically made a calculated risk that did not pay off. Meghan was a very esoteric, high-risk artist-- you know, very edgy work-- but she had very high price points. Three of the folks on the team decided to go with Meghan. One person still wanted to go with Leah. - So we went ahead and went with Meghan. - Who was the one person? - Omarosa. -1 think you're to be commended. You know, there's avery great businessman in this country named Kirk Kerkorian. He bought tremendous amounts of Chrysler stock, and the stock went up like a rocket ship. And he made a tremendous amount of money. And I said to him, “Kirk, how did you do this? Why did you do this?” And he said, “ loved the look of their new products.” And I say, here's a case where you hated the look of the work of the person you were selling. And I don't get it. 1 hoped and wished that we could certainly succeed at the task, but 1 knew in my heart that we couldn', which is why I expressed very early on, before we decided on the artist, that this was not the right choice. [ George ] I'm not sure in my own mind whether or not you picked another artist, you would've had a different result. What I am concerned with is how you operated as a team, and from what... -1 have seen and what I understand, there was a lot of dissension among the ranks. - [ Trump ] What happened, Heidi? Omarosa, she wanted to sit down to eat. I wanted to grab a quick thing at the deli, get in a cab and go. - And it turned into a fight. - Can I just tell you? I've been walking around for a week with a concussion, and I needed a moment, and I asked you for that, Heidi. And you just ignored me completely. Well, because the headaches were coming and going. I mean, you were fine in the morning, and it was just getting a sandwich to go. I mean, there was no need to sit. I've been a trouper for this team. What does a concussion have to do with sitting down for lunch when you're supposed to be working? You got hit on the head with a little piece of plastic that-- By the way, all my life I've been hit on the head with plastic. Omarosa-- 1 mean, you know, give me a break. Let's not-- I'm not being dramatic. I've had horrible-- Because you have this horrible concussion, you took lunch instead of working, right? ls that the excuse? Mr. Trump, if you believe I was lazy at any point-- - [ Trump ] I'm not saying that at all. - I"msorry. I didn't know I was gonna be attacked for being hit in the head. - You're not being attacked, 1 just domn't get it. - Okay. And I still don't know really what that has to do with taking lunch when you're supposed to be working. I wanted to take five minutes to eat. I called the P.M. first, and he can tell you. - And I asked him if that was okay. - Kwame, do you think that Omarosa makes excuses? I will say that at times, she tends to exaggerate-- at times. And she does tend to be somewhat dramatic, and that, I think, is a sentiment many folks have within this team and the other team. It seems like I keep hearing this every time your team is in the boardroom. Okay. Kwame, it's time. You have to make a decision. Who are the two people... who you feel didn't perform as well as they should have? Once again, I always have to compare people to my all-star, and that's Troy. And sol"m gonna take the two ladies with me to the boardroom. - Troy's gonna go up to the suite. - [ Trump ] All right. So, Troy, you're going up to the suite. Heidi, Omarosa, you wait outside with Kwame. Enjoy the evening. Beautiful building-- Trump Tower-- the best. I'm trying to hold it together. I've been runmnin' around with my head killin' me, Kwame. [ Sobbing, Speaking, Indistinct ] I understand. [ Omarosa Continues Talking, Indistinct ] - Let me ask you a question, if/ may. - Mr. Trump, I've worked for the last two weeks. -[Trump] Omarosa, I didn't call for you yet. - I've been running around for a week. We all have problems. Life is full of problems. I mean, I understand. - My problem-- cancer. - [ Trump ] All right. Sit down. Omarosa. - [Omarosa ] Can I grab a tissue? My nose is running. - Go ahead. Grab a napkin. [ Sniffling ] Omarosa, come on in. Sit down. Kwame, what do you have to say? I think I did a good job as a leader. It was a calculated risk that went wrong, and I'll stand by my decision. But, you know, at the same time, if it would've paid off, we would've won, and it didn't, so now I'm here. - Omarosa, what would you say? - Yesterday, I worked so hard. I was finance manager. I helped distribute supplies. Did you think it was unfair that they criticized you for taking time out for lunch? - Yes. - Which is something people do. They take time out for lunch. But in this case, you're given a very small amount of time. - I've pressed for the last 48 hours nonstop. - [ Trump ] What happened, Heidi? My concern was, to be honest with you, sitting down in a restaurant... could take, in New York-- it was a busy day-- I was concerned that would take longer than 25 minutes. Yourre right. Everyone takes lunch. I'm just used to-- on the go. If she explained it that eloquently to me yesterday, we probably wouldn't have had a problem. - You didn't let me get a chance to. - She likes to drop the “F” bomb every five minutes. - Oh, my God. You gotta be kidding me. - That's why we fought, to be frank. - The what bomb? - The “F” bomb. - What is the “F” bomb? [ Curse too much. So that's gonna stop me from going to lunch? That's excuses. I don't have time for these catty games. I wanted to get the job done. Well, do you think Omarosa did a good job or not such a hot job? - She did an okay job. - [ George ] In your mind, is okay good or is okay not good? -1t's not good. - Okay. - What do you think of the job Heidi did? -1 didn't see Heidi make a significant contribution to this task. Kwame entrusted me in doing a lot of responsibilities in this task. When my team was unable to do something, you know, I went ahead and stepped up. Okay. 50 it's time. [ Exhales Strongly ] Heidi, you have an edge to you that really gets people a little crazy. - That's so. - And you've been drivin' people a little nuts. You know that, right? - Yeah, yeah. - This is not the first time this has happened. No. [Trump] Omarosa, this competition st about how much you know; it's about leadership and getting along with your team. It's not about distracting your teammates from the task at hand. You know, our team leader did a terrible job, but, Kwame, at least you took a risk. And even though it didn't pay off, [ think you learned your lesson. And, besides, I've been known to take a few risks myself once in a while. But what really makes me nuts ls the fact that there's constant fighting in this group. And it's always one excuse after another. I don't like the fact that you two argued over whether or not to have lunch... when you have a small amount of time, and you were the one that wanted the lunch. Omarosa, go out and sell paintings or whatever the hell you're doing. I don't like excuses. In this case, Omarosa has to go. You're fired. - Thanks for the opportunity to be here. Thank you all. - Thank you very much. And good luck. - Thank you. - 'l try to stop from driving you nuts. Thank you. [Trump] Okay. Thank you, Kwame. [Trump] Omarosa has a huge chip on her shoulder. She felt that she was superior to the other people. She's very smart, but I think her attitude was terrible. I was a little tough with her, but she's always makin” excuses. I agree with that. I leave this game with no regrets... and with only the pride that I did the very best I could... and that [ am a good person who knows how to fight for what she believes in. For all of my housemates, I'd like to say it was a pleasure to get to know each of them. I would encourage them to open their minds and hearts to differences and diversity... and more importantly, to remember no man is your friend, no man is your foe and every man is your teacher.
