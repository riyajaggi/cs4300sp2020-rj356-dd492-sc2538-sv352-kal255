 [Declan] Previously on Bad Blood. Running things all alone comes with problems you can't even imagine. I don't work for anyone. They want us to move to fentanyl. A few grains of this can kill someone. [Nellie] You're married to the one capo who wants to share his feelings with his wife. - What do you have for me? - Nothing. We are now in possession of Declan's entire shipment. Good work. - I need you to find two people for me. - Let me guess, twins?

 We took your drugs. We're gonna take your city. We have heard of your little problems. Our payment deadline is still the same date. Understood. If you reconsider our offer, we will return your shipment. You've read me all wrong. Get down! I'm suddenly needing a place to stay, Rose. No one's gonna look for me here. We need to find Declan. I want him dead. We need to end this. [grunting] [tyres screeching] Where's Declan?

 I don't know. [gulps] [shallow breathing] [shouting] Where is he? I don't know. Tell us where he is, and all this can be over. I don't know. Declan doesn't leave much of a footprint, as you can imagine. So we have people who locate others for us, and all they could find was that this year, out of nowhere, he starts visiting you in prison, every week. And then he arranges for you to live with him during your parole. That is quite a lot for a nephew, hmm? [sizzling] Where is Declan? Where is he? Stop. Stop! Stop! Stop! I don't know! He just told me that he's moving around. I don't know where he is! I don't know! [theme music] - This is the only time I've seen them. - You lost them. - Declan, I... - You lost them. I followed them after the meeting. They each had their own car and a decoy. It was like an eggshell game. I wasn't expecting that at all. I'll find them. Don't worry. Not that I've ever seen you worry. - Or blink or sleep. - What else you got? Domenic and Enzo meet daily, usual mobster stuff, a lot of food and coffee. And Luca, he works out, and he gets laid. The single life. And Nats, he stays home to watch their baby, so his wife can go to yoga or get a manicure. Next time I have eyes on them, I'll find them. - That's for you. - Alright. I'll upload new stuff to my private server when I have it. Alright. How's Reggie? He's good. Thanks for doing that. Saw the meds he's taking. Had a girlfriend who was on a lot of that stuff too. It's hard to deal with. You can't take that all on yourself. Thanks, Mum. [phone beeps] [line ringing] [Teresa] It's a touching story, your nephew just told us. Your sister dies at 18, overdose. You have no one left. Then years later, Reggie contacts you from prison. He didn't know her, and you didn't know he existed. But he found you. And just like that, you're no longer alone. I've rarely been apart from my brother for more than a few weeks. I can't imagine what that must have felt like. What do you want? I want this mess between us to be over with. I promise, our bond, our word, he will live. Our family reputation is built upon the honour of our agreements. Shut up. I don't, I don't give a crap about that. I'm gonna, I'm gonna kill you, then I'm gonna kill your brother, then I'm gonna take everything you've got. No, you won't. Andiamo. You will be receiving coordinates shortly. If you want him to live, you have three hours to present yourself. Until then, the torture continues. [phone beeps] Oh man, oh man, oh man... What is it? [phone beeps] Declan, what is it? I've got three hours to save Reggie. Declan, what's going on? How old is Nats' baby? Uh, about a year old? Why? You trust me? Of course, whatever you need. I need your car. The car seat. [Lisa] There are lines no one should cross. Yeah, and they crossed it. It's almost been three hours. If you're gonna do this, you gotta go. [birds chirping] [Adamo giggling] [Nats] You listen to me now, OK? I'm talking. Yeah, three months ago, you promised me it was gonna stop when I spoke to your manager on the phone. Well, two months ago, I was in your location, OK, and I spoke to a Brianna or something like that. [thudding] [echoing voice] Hey. Hey. Can you hear me? Nod your head if you can hear me. [breathing heavily] You know who I am? - Do ya? - [grunting] Listen to me. Teresa and Christian... they kidnapped someone very important to me. [phone beeps] Reggie. Did you know about this? [grunting] - Did you? - [muffled] No. You know what? I believe you. Now, if this is just about the drugs that they stole from me, I wouldn't be here, Nats. But they went too far. Domenic and your papa, would they do something like this? No. No, they wouldn't. And now I have to stop them. And there's only one way your family is gonna listen. So, here's what I want. I want Reggie back alive. I want five million for the drugs you stole. Do as I say, and this will be over fast and easy. Nats... I do not wanna be here right now. I don't. I don't wanna do what I'm about to do. This is gonna be tough on me, but nowhere near as tough as it's gonna be on you. Pop. Let's call him. [line ringing] Hello, my son. I was just thinking... Enzo, don't talk. This is Declan. - You listen to me very carefully, Enzo. - Where's my son? Those twins, they kidnaped my nephew. - What are you saying? - And they're torturing him. - What are you talking about? - You call them and tell them to stop. - I want him back. - It has nothing to do with any of us! - What's happening, Declan? Please... - Or you'll never ever... gonna see your grandson alive again. Don't touch him! You son of a bitch! - What are you doing? - Don't touch him! Pop! Pop, he's taking Adamo. - Stop! Stop! - Get back on the phone! Stop! [Nats screaming in distance] No! No! No! [boat horn blaring] [seagulls squawking] Diapers, formula and food. Ah, he's still calm. That's good. OK, so, what's the plan? You can't just drive around with a baby. There's a crappy motel five miles east. Mainly truckers and hookers, but... No. No, even crappy hotels have security cameras. I'm staying at Bobby's reserve. I can hole out there. This is gonna go down fast when it goes down. Shelley, I need that car seat, and I could use your car. I'll get them both back to you, I promise. Declan, it's a two-hour drive. He's gonna need to eat. He's gonna need to be changed. - Well, I... - You're a badass gangster who I totally trust with my life, but you're not a mother. - [Adamo babbling] - Let's go. Why are we still here? Why are we even still talking? We'll give him what he wants, and that's that. So please tell me where this ass is so we can get this over with, please. Ignazio, we cannot let Declan dictate the terms. Yes, we can. No, he's dictating the terms, OK? He's got my son, and he wants what? His nephew and his money. So, guess what, we're gonna give it to him. This is a negotiation, OK? We made an offer, he countered, and now it's our turn. It's not negotiation. It's a war. And you started it, OK? We told you not to, and you did anyway. Now Declan has hit back, and he hit back hard. So now you're gonna tell me where Reggie is. - Wait. Wait. - Where is he? Dom, we can get two mil from the sportsbook. - I got a mil in the safe. - I got your back. I'll cover the rest. - OK. That's done. - Spend your money however you wish. But you have nothing to negotiate without the nephew. You son of a bitch! You son of a bitch! Nothing to negotiate? Nothing? Hey. This isn't your decision, OK? Declan is not going to harm your son. - How can you say that? - Because I met the man. I looked into his eyes. He doesn't have it in him. I don't care what you have to say anymore. I don't wanna hear anything out of your mouth except for where Reggie is. You are not thinking rationally right now, OK? And that is why we, we will be handling this negotiation. We are impartial. Oh, what did do you say? You're impar... [whispering indistinctly] Impartial? Impartial, yeah? - Are you impartial now? - Nats, calm down! You still impartial now? Cos now you're in it. - You take that gun out of my son's face. - Where's Reggie? Where is Reggie? Now you're looking in my eyes. Do I have it in me? Enzo, Enzo, Enzo. Under any other circumstance, your son would already be dead. You don't talk to me like that. Nats, please don't make things worse. Put that goddamn gun down. Not until he tells me where Reggie is, Pop. I'm not putting this gun down until you tell me where Reggie is. Good for you, Nats. Good for you, bravo. Do what you think is right. Stop. What are we gonna do right now? We're gonna shoot each other? Do you see what this animal is doing to us? This is not what family does. Do you understand that? Now, both of you, listen to me. You take a goddamn breath. Lower your gun, please, Siro. We will try this your way. Down. Come on. Save your son. Save your son. Finally. I was pleasantly surprised when I got your text. Did you just feel like having some girl time or... do you have something to tell me? [sighing] The family was being asked to move into fentanyl. What do you mean, "being asked?" This didn't come from Domenic? He said Dom and his father don't wanna do it. So, who's telling them? Teresa and Christian? Yeah. So they're giving the orders now? I think so. I don't know. Maybe. - What else did Nats say? - Nothing. That was it. I tried to get more, but he didn't wanna talk about. Look, he doesn't wanna do it, alright? He is totally against this. This is good work, Val. But I need more. Get it out of him. Act curious, ask about the twins, what they wanna do, where they are, what their plans are. I know how to ask a f... [chuckles] I know how to ask a question, alright? That's all I got for you. Well, this is good. I'm proud of you. There's just one more thing. For Adamo. I know his birthday is coming, and it was my favourite growing up. Are you sick? [chuckling] What, do you think we're friends? Honey, I wouldn't let my son take a dump on that book if it came from you. [Enzo] You know, he's never gonna forgive himself. [Domenic] Oh, give him a beat. Relax, alright? He just, he needs to calm down. Yeah. You'd calm down if someone kidnapped Luca? Enzo, he pulled a gun on 'em. He was hot. It was... It was a mistake. I know, he crossed a line. There's blood in the water. Um, here. Yeah, that's good. [sighing] Oh. [Adamo cooing] This, my friend, is a very good baby. - Can I use the washroom? OK. - Yeah. Hi. Hey, hey. [giggling] It's gonna be OK. Yeah. [giggling] [sighing] [nostalgic music] [phone beeps] [line ringing] - Declan. - Do we have a deal? I wanna see him. [phone beeps] Nats, focus. Do we have a deal? I wanna see my son. Put it on speakerphone. See, he's doing just fine. Listen to me. In three hours, I'll pick up Reggie and the money at the location I just texted you. Do you see it? Now, if I see one cop or any of your men, if I get a whiff of an ambush, if I so much as think the colour of the sky is wrong, your baby is gone, am I clear? Yes. Once I have Reggie and the money, I'll tell you where you can get your son. He's just a baby. You can't leave him some place, OK? He'll be safe, Nats. You have to trust me. We don't agree to your conditions. What the hell did you just do? This is not going to work your way. [phone ringing] If you answer that, I will never tell you where the nephew is. We will call him in one hour, make him wait. We are not just going to give him everything he wants. You could've just killed my grandson. Declan needs something. This isn't over. It's not your call to make. It's exactly our call to make. You must be crazy if you think I'm gonna let you decide the fate of my grandson! We told you to find Declan, and you haven't! So we did something. Now, if you let us do this our way, I guarantee you would have your son, you would have your money, and we would be rid of this man! This is a process. And right now, everyone needs a little break. [phone ringing] To calm down and clear their minds. Calm down and clear my mind? Are you crazy? - Nats! - Clear my mind? - Come on. Come on. - Nats, let's go outside. Hey, hey. Let's go outside. Come on. [phone ringing] [line ringing] Just got him changed. - [phone beeps] - They agree to it? [Adamo giggling] [door opening] Hey. Who's this? That's Shelley. - Is this your baby? - Uh, no. Is this your baby? We'll be out of here soon, OK? Why aren't you answering a very easy question? Should I leave you alone? - Oh no. - What the hell is going on? Rose, let's take it outside. - I don't wanna disturb this. - I can't believe you brought someone. I know. I'll tell you. Hey, hey. The Italians, they kidnapped my nephew, Reggie. Whose baby is that? Nats Cosoleto. - Nats Cosoleto? - I know, I know, I know... Shit, Declan. This is not what I signed up for. You gotta leave, and you gotta take that baby with you. - Soon. Can't. - Now. "Can't" is what people say when someone suggests kidnapping a baby. "Sorry, I can't do that." Hey, look at that. It's my nephew. He's completely innocent. They're holding him somewhere. They're torturing him. I had to do something. - What do they want? - They want me. [sighing] This is not what I signed up for. I know. I know. OK, truth be told, I'm not gonna harm that baby. If they call my bluff, I lose. I had to do something, Rose. I, I had to stop it. I had nowhere else safe to go. It's a shitty position to put you in, I know. Yeah, it is. What would you have done? Tell me, what would you have done if someone kidnapped Bobby or Twix or Wes? It's gonna be OK. I'm gonna get Reggie back. I'm gonna get it all back. We should just kill Reggie and be done with it. If we do that, we lose them completely. It's not like you to be so compromising. We have a lot to get done here. We can replace them later, not now. They're unreliable. They're predictable. Declan knew exactly what to do. He didn't kidnap Nats or Luca. He took a baby. Everyone goes soft for a baby. [phone dinging] Here, the church. Good. Get some men over there. Got it. Declan is finished. Hey, babe. Nats? I don't trust them. They don't give a damn about us. They don't give a damn about Adamo. - I'm calling. - No. - I'm calling Declan. - Don't. Don't. Don't. - [phone ringing] - Give me my phone. It's Val. What do I tell her? Don't answer it. You wait until we know something. I gotta tell Val. It's been hours. It's been hours. We have no deal, no plan. We got no clue. If she finds out now, she's gonna completely lose her shit, so I'm keeping this. Here. Smoke. Breathe. - Yeah. - Breathe. It sounds crass cos we're talking about Adamo, OK? But it is a negotiation, OK, and not only between us and Declan, but between us and them. Look... I swear to you, I'll put a bullet in their heads if that boy gets hurt. He took him. He took him right in front of me. I watched him walk out the door holding him. It's the first time in his life I'm worried. You don't think... You don't think Declan would hurt him or nothing, eh? - No, we're gonna get him back. - He won't hurt him or nothing, eh? We're gonna get him back, OK? I promise you. Everything's gonna be fine, OK? OK? Everything's gonna be fine. [sobbing] OK. OK. Everything's gonna be fine, OK? I'm gonna kill him. I'm gonna kill him. Yeah, I'm gonna kill him. Hey, hey, hey... I'm gonna kill him. [insects and birds chirping] [blowing a raspberry] Do you think he's hungry? He's OK. Maybe take him outside and get some fresh air. It's a little cool. I have a kid's blanket at the house. Is it wool though? Is it itchy? No, fine. You guys are cute. It's like a sitcom in here somewhere, you know, two gangsters and a baby. [phone vibrating] [phone beeps] Yeah? We are going to do the exchange face to face in public. You bring the child. We bring your nephew and the money. Fair for you, fair for us. - Where? - A church. There will be enough civilians to keep everybody calm, and the eyes of God to keep you honest. I want Domenic to bring Reggie and the money alone. If I see anyone else, the deal is off. The family has made it clear that they want this matter settled. But it will not be Domenic. It will be Nats. It is his son after all. Alone. I'll be alone. Outside on the steps. Alone, Nats. No. My son is not gonna do this. I'm going, Pop. You know I understand, but you don't gotta do this. Not like this. [Christian] You said you wanted to do things his way. This is his way. No, you can't do this alone. I'm going with you. Everybody stop telling me what to do. Zio, I'm gonna go get my son back. OK. Text me Reggie's location. I've known Declan a long time. I'm not going to give you a dead kitten story, but he's helped me out a lot. And I just want you to know he is a tough mother but he's got a code. You know, you do right by him, and he'll be your cavalry. Yeah, well, let's hope he doesn't need it today. Keys for the truck? Um... Here, I'll put the seat in. [Adamo cooing] I'm sure Nats will play along. He's not gonna risk his child. Thanks for everything, Rose. I look forward to meeting your nephew when you come back. - [Nats] Val. - Where's Adamo? Val, just don't say anything. Let me finish. [Val] Stop talking. Just tell me where he is! Someone took him. He had a gun, and he tied me up, and he took, he took Adamo. I'm sorry. [gasping] [crying] I'll... I can, I can... You let someone take your son? What kind of man are you? - He had a gun, OK? - Where is he? It was retribution because the twins took this guy's nephew. Who? Who? Who took him? His name's Declan. It doesn't matter what... You hid this from me all day while I'm here by myself? No, I had to make arrangements, but it's taken care of now. I'm gonna go get him. Where are you going? Stop. I'm going to get our son. Where? An Anglican church outside of Odessa. OK, I'm calling the police. Are you crazy? You're not calling the... What are you doing? Why you calling the police, huh? What are you gonna say to 'em? "My family kidnapped this guy. Then they took my son. I need help." Look, look, look. It's OK. It's OK, OK? I'm gonna go get him. I will call you the second I have him. I promise you. I promise you, OK? No. Wait. Stop. I'm going with you. You're not coming with me. You are not going with me. OK? You need to listen to me for once, please. - He told me to come alone, so I'm going. - He has my son! You don't call me all day. I'm losing my shit, and you think I'm not gonna go with you? I'm not just gonna sit here. I'm going to get my son. I'll wait for you in the car. [door opening, slamming] [phone beeps, line ringing] [safe beeps] [breathing heavily] [phone ringing] - Hey. - I have 30 seconds. You gotta help me. My son's been kidnapped. What? This guy Declan took my son cos those twins kidnapped someone from him. We're making the exchange at some Anglican church in Odessa. - Who you talking to? - My mother. Got her all worried cos I couldn't reach you, so I called to tell her everything's fine now. No, nothing's fine. What's going on? Val just called. Declan kidnapped their son. She and Nats are on their way to an exchange. Whoa. Why? She only had a few seconds to talk. I think the twins took someone from Declan. She said they're doing the exchange at an Anglican Church in Odessa. Call local PD, get them over there. [seagulls squawking] [grunting] Hi. [line ringing] [Declan] Yeah? This is a no-go. I see at least three different cars. Two cops, one not. Thanks, Shelley. Sorry, I gotta get off the train here. Have to think about my family at this juncture. You did more than enough. See ya. [Adamo crying] - What are you looking at? - Nothing. Declan takes our son for a piece of shit like you? In what universe is that a fair trade, huh? - It isn't. - Not even close. - I completely agree... - Shut up. Shut up. OK. [phone ringing] Yeah, hello? Hey, Nats. You on the road? Yeah. I wanna talk to Reggie. You're on speaker. Hey. Hey. You OK? I, I've been worse... Do you have the cartel's money? It's beside me, yeah. Reggie, I want you to look out the window right now. Try and find a road sign so I know where you are. Anyone else in the car with you? Yeah, his wife. Nats, Nats. I told you to go alone. I'm his mother. You think I'm not gonna get my child? - Val. - I tell you what, if you hurt him, if you touch my boy, I am gonna rip your heart out. Mrs. Cosoleto, I can appreciate that. Nats, I won't hold that against you. - Go to hell. - Are you done? I'll be done when I get my boy back. We're on Highway two, and we just passed Exit 43. OK, Nats, take the next exit. Get off. No, we make the exchange face to face. - That was the deal. - It still is. How do we know you have him? Oh, I have him. He's just fine. He's with an animal, he's not fine. Look at your phone. I just sent you a pic. [phone chiming] See, he's fine. You're gonna get him back soon. Adamo, Mama's coming. Papa's coming, honey, OK? OK. OK, we're getting off the highway now. OK, Reggie, look out the rear window. How many cars do you see? Declan, no one is following me. Three cars. OK, keep watching, see if they follow. OK. Nats, turn left. You should be on Lewis Street. Reggie, anything? There's two cars now, a red one and a black one. Turn left again, Nats. Reg? The black one is still there. Pull over, Nats. Declan, this is ridiculous. We came alone. We didn't do anything. We did whatever you said to do. That would be a lie. Pull over. Who is that? Declan, he stopped. Declan, I, I got no idea who that is. I promise you we came alone. Say goodbye, Nats. Say goodbye to your boy. No, wait. Wait. No. Please, I don't know who that is! You gotta believe me! You broke our agreement. - No, he didn't! - Wait! Wait! I'll get him to go! I'll get him to go, OK? I don't know who that is. I'll get him to go. [Reggie] Declan. What? I believe him. Alright, Nats. Get out of your car. Go back and tell that car to turn around. Yeah, OK. OK. Don't hang up, OK? Don't hang up. [breathing heavily] Hey! What are you doing here? You think I was gonna let you do this alone? He knows you're following us. Reggie's on the phone with him, - telling him everything. - I'll lay further back. He won't see me. If you don't go, I don't know what he'll do to Adamo. You gotta turn around. I know you wanna help, but you gotta turn around right now. You don't know what's waiting for you there. Listen to me. Turn around right now. Get this through your head. He will not give me Adamo if I'm not alone! [tyres screeching] Declan, it was my cousin, Luca. I promise you I didn't say nothing to him, and he's gone now. - Reggie? - Yeah, he's taking off. OK, Nats. Start your car. Go straight ahead. Turn right at the next street. That'll be Brookdale Avenue. You stay on that. It's gonna seem like forever, but you're almost there. Wait, why aren't we going to the church? Because those freak twins sent people there, Nats, which means they have zero, zero regard for your beautiful baby boy. I'm making this safer for us. Mind the speed limit. I'll call you back. I'm telling my mum we're going out for a late dinner, in case she passes by. [message app whooshing] OK, this is where they must be. Call off the others. Get local black and whites over there. [camera clicking] OK. It's almost over. And then what? What about the next guy your family pisses off? Can we just be a team for, like, five minutes? Try and imagine if I had been the reason Adamo was taken. You think you'd be talking about team, then? - I just wanna tell you I'm sorry... - Shut up. Shut up. [phone ringing] - [phone beeps] - Yeah? [Declan] You're gonna be coming up to Taylor Street. Make a right, keep driving, then turn left onto Daly. [phone beeps] Daly Street. Is there any other information? No, that's it. [gun cocking] Big day. You wanna see him? Adamo. Adamo. Your mama and your papa are here, buddy. Get your hands on the wheel. Nats, don't move 'em. I know you want to, but don't move 'em. Reggie, let's go. Bring the money. Sit by me. Come on. Come on. You tied him up? Gimme your hands. [crying] Open up the bag. Look through the top of the bills. See if there's any stuffing and filling or tracers. There's nothing in there, Declan. Let me come get him. How's it look? It just looks like money. It's OK. Come get your boy. Not you. Her. No! No! No! - Val! - It's fine! [gasping] - You think I'm gonna forget this? - You should. This was me and you, fixing their mess, your family. Bye-bye. [tyres screeching] [gunshots, glass shatters] [horn blaring and woman screaming] [screaming] Oh, my God. [Val] Nats. [Adamo crying] [whispering] Come here. Come here. Come here, come here. [sighing] It's OK. It's OK, sweet boy. It's OK. It's OK. - [sirens wailing] - It's OK. It's OK. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. [Christian] They didn't want to listen. Look what happened.
