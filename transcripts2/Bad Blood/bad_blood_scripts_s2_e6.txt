 We want you to only buy from us. No more Declan. We get a tip like this it's from a competitor. The bust will barely cause a dent. They'll have another up and running in no time. You will work with the Irish. Declan is no longer welcome. We gotta hit 'em, keep 'em off balance. When something like this happens, we eliminate everyone involved. Nobody's gonna touch my son.

He didn't tell you that his wife was snitching. I wonder what else he hasn't told you. You talked to the cops! You tell me what you said! But I know these people, and their love of family.

 The only way we win is to get them to rip themselves apart. This is where it starts. There you are! Hey, hey! I was looking for you. Hey! - How you doing? - I've just been thinking, you know, maybe I should just go. - Go where? - I don't know. Like, I could still get into a halfway house. Like, that's what I was supposed to do. I was supposed to go, and I didn't go. You're not going anywhere. You're with me. I can't stop thinking about that cop. His family never gets to see him again. You gotta stop doing this to yourself. Okay, stop it. That was an accident. He's dead 'cause of me. Reggie, I've been there. It's hard. But that one moment does not define who you are. - I'm sorry. - No, come on, stop it! You don't have to apologize to anyone for anything. I'd be dead if you didn't do what you did. You ever thought about that? Or we'd be in prison. Well, maybe I should be in prison, all right? 'Cause my whole life, everything I do, I just make things worse. I want you to stop thinking like that. Hang on a sec. I gotta take this. - Yeah? - Did you get my photos? Give me a minute. All right. Look, we don't have anything linking the twins to the church operation. It's basically just chemistry equipment. We searched the place high and low. That lighter... That's Teresa's. How do you know that? 'Cause I know! Dust it for prints. You'll match it to hers. You'll get yourselves a warrant. I don't think her prints are gonna be in our system. Well, they're somewhere! You wanna play with the big boys, figure it out. Reggie! What did you say? Just-just about the two, Christian and Teresa. You tell me your exact words to them, exactly what you said to them. Just about the fentanyl, but that they wanna do it, and you don't want to, and your family doesn't want to and... Where'd you get this? My doorstep. There's another recording of when you went to see Nats. He lied to you, Enzo. He knew all about this, and he didn't tell you. So, you don't know who sent this to you? No, what difference does it make? What if it's Teresa and Christian? I mean, they could be testing us to see if we're loyal. We're not telling them squat. This stays in the family. I agree with that. You don't say a word. Listen, this could be a fake. A fake? What is this, Mission Impossible? Who-who could record them in prison? I don't know. We gotta stick with the issue at hand here. You know what we gotta do. We're not touching her. Enzo, if this was anybody else but Val, it would already be done. We're not touching her. Nats is gonna be in prison for the next 20 years. I'm not leaving my grandson without a father or a mother. Enzo, come on! You know where this is gonna go. It's Adamo's birthday tomorrow. I don't wanna talk about knocking off his mother. I can't believe she's even having a party. Husband's in prison. It's an embarrassment. I mean, I'm not going. - What? - What am I gonna do? Enzo, she's a rat. You're coming! Luca, you're coming! You're gonna smile, eat her food and sing goddamn Happy Birthday. This is about my grandson. Okay? She's my daughter-in-law, not some bum in Gore Park. End of story. - Pop, are you serious? - Don't start! I mean, you go behind my back. You talked to those twins. You don't... you don't get a say. It's between me and my brother. Play one of the best new FPS shooters, search Steam for PROJECT WARLOCK That's 90%. Perfect. Come on! They beefed up border security on the river. - So be extra careful. - Don't worry about it. I got you. It takes 26 minutes to get across. Engine quiet, lights out. Water pigs stick to the same route. So we know how to avoid 'em. I'm your guy! Just do it right. I'll see you on the other side. Let's go! I had a lot of spinning plates in the air. I was keeping the business running, going after the twins and trying to take care of Reggie. So I couldn't be in all places at once. Everything on the reserve ran smoothly under Rose, so I wasn't looking at the people around her the way I usually would, but I should've. I've always found that when things are going off without a hitch, it means that someone on the inside is working extra hard to make sure you don't look twice. What are you doing? I had to drop off my tools. That couldn't wait? We're dividing it up in the garage. Hurry up! Declan's gotta meet his buyers. No problem. Everything's cool, sis. You don't recognize me? Well, if I recognize you, I'm not gonna go: "Who are you?" Who are you? You gave us up. Your children. You gave up me and my beautiful little sister so you could get high. Call your dad. Hello? Hey, Papa, it's me. Nats? You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Bobby gave me a phone to call you. Oh, good. I need to talk to you about something. Why didn't you tell me about Valentina? I know she cheated on you. I know she snitched. That goddamn cop came to me, and tried to flip me! I'm sorry, Pop. I know... I know I should've told you, but she screwed up so bad. And you swore. You swore on Mom's grave you'd protect her, remember? And I will. And don't say a word to Dom, please. 'Cause you know what he's gonna say. Hey, hey! Don't worry. It'll be fine. But you gotta be careful what you say from now on. That cop's got you bugged. She even played me the damn recording. That's why I had Bobby give you his phone. Okay, Pop. I'm sorry for all of this. Hey, you wanna talk to Adamo? Hang on! There's my little birthday boy! Very excited about his big day. You wanna speak to your daddy? Oh wow! Nats, Adamo can hear you now. Is that my beautiful boy I hear there? It's your papa! You're one years old today! You came... you came into our world one year ago. You made your mother and I the luckiest 2 people in the world. Sorry I can't be there for you, big guy! I love you, buddy. I love you so much. - Okay, Adamo. - "Bye-bye, Papa!" I wanna talk to him. You wanna talk to Val? No, I gotta go, Pop. I love you. Oh! Wow! I wanted to talk to him. Why would he wanna talk to you? Sorry. Let's just get through today. We're gonna need some more chairs. I'll get them from the garage. Enzo. - Who else knows? - What? Did you tell Domenic? - No, Val. - Okay. What if the cop gives the tapes to Domenic? They tried to squeeze you. They might try to squeeze him. - I don't have time for this! - What about the twins? I don't like talking to the cops about you. I don't like talking to my son in jail about you. We have one job to do today, and that's to have this party. Can you do this without making it all about you? I don't wanna raise this boy alone by myself for the rest of my life! And I don't have to do that because I made a mistake, Enzo. It's your job! I have to do that because your son killed somebody. And he did that because you sell drugs and you beat people up and God knows what else for a living. That's why! Careful. I know how much you love your grandson. So, you're right, let's just get through this day. The chairs are in the study. - Where's the stash? - Trunk. Boys! You know, the absence of your usual sunny disposition is telling me you got a bug up your ass. I bet I know what it is. Can I guess? Now that the Irish are no longer playing this game... you're welcome... you've just inherited a whole new swath of territory. I was expecting a thank you. But instead, what do I get? I get this Gandalf scowl from you? You should be walking on the sunny side of the street, Alex. You're thinking: "Well, if he's wiped out the Irish, maybe he's coming for me next." The answer to that question is no. We are in this together. We are the only 2 guys who know what the hell is really going on. We're not the Irish. So if I wanna talk to someone, I talk to who I want. You wanna negotiate with me? I mean, you've got the sweetest deal in town. Our numbers stand! No, I just wanna remind you this is and will always be our home. No one, no one will push us out. Très bien! Bon! But you're tense. I feel it in your bones. Your boys can feel it. Relax, get a massage, paint your toenails red. How's the purity? 90% as always. See you next week, I guess. Yeah. Hey! Stay smart. Mm-hmm. Rose! Hey! Um, I hate to ask, but I need you to do something for me. I want you to go to Bobby and ask him for me to break his protection on Nats. Um, Bobby won't break protection. That's his word. I need him to do that. Why do you need that? You wanna get Teresa and Christian for what they did to Wes? This is how we're gonna do it. Don't play me. Don't make this about Wes. It's about your business. I don't play, Rose, and I don't lie. This is about me, but this is the piece that'll knock their legs right out from underneath them. And we both will get what we want. Well, Bobby won't talk to me. He won't even see me, so I'm no help there. You're gonna have to ask him yourself. Sorry. Sorry to hear that. Listen, no trouble. Enz, take it ease, all right? You were right. This is the first grandchild in the family. Let's celebrate. There she is! Valentina, wow! Look at you! You look beautiful. Thank you. - This is for you. - What's this? Well, I don't want you worrying about anything. You got a lot to deal with. So we're gonna take care of you. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Thank you. - Val! - Luca! You're a knock out! Look at you. Now, where's my godson? Outside with Lucia. Let me take your coat. No, coat's good, thank you. I'll get you some wine. Yeah, maybe later. I'm good. I can take care of myself. You, uh, you enjoy your day. You see? Everything's fine. My brother and I are happy you are open to a discussion. All right, what are you offering? Well, we are opening 5 fentanyl-production locations, and we want you and your men to run them, protect them, and control distribution across Quebec. I heard your first batch didn't go so well. Understand what we are offering, Alex. I can hire chemists, too, you know. Yes, but you are now only purchasing cocaine from Declan. Now that the Irish are gone, you are well-positioned to control distribution across all of Quebec. We were here before you and we'll be here after you. So don't think about doing to us what you did to Declan. Am I clear? We want partners, not, uh, adversaries. When we settle on numbers, we'll give a try. For both of our businesses, we want you to take care of Declan. You know the roads. The territory is yours. If anyone can find him, it's you. You do this, and everything we promised will be yours. Deal. We'll be in touch. Mmm! Valentina, you gotta tell me this recipe. Insomnia! - It's beautiful. - I stirred it off and on since dawn. Come over here. Try this. Valentina made the risotto. - No, no, no. - It's fantastic. I'm dairy-free. I can't do it. Try it! Have some respect! Try it! Beautiful! Mmm! Que bueno! It's really good. You didn't make this. Yes, I did! No, you didn't. It's too good! What are you guys doing here? There's a birthday in your family. Where else would we be? No, no, no, you shouldn't be here. This isn't a good idea. Is that them? - Yeah, it's them. - No, I don't want them here. - No, calm down. - Please, get them out! Just be nice. Val... Uh, this is Teresa and Christian. It's a pleasure to meet you finally. I know this is a difficult time, but my family has been through the same thing. And if we all stick together, we can get through this. For, uh, Adamo. Please, eat, make yourselves at home. Thank you. Ain't this a surprise! And this must be the birthday boy! May I hold him? Val, is that okay? Sure. Thank you. - Ah! - Oh, hello! You are very handsome! He has your eyes. So beautiful! Lovely home you have. I'm really sorry about Wes. Really sorry. How you managing? Keepin' on. What did you come by for? I want you to break protection on Nats. You know I can't break protection. - I know, but this is different. - I gave my word. I haven't told Nats you're hiding out on my reserve, and his family would really like to know that. I wouldn't ask if we didn't need it. This is how I'm gonna get the people who killed your son. The day that Wes died, Nats was sitting right here next to me in jail. It's not about Nats. It's about his family. They're responsible. You wanna see them just walk away? I didn't ask you to do anything. Bobby, if I didn't know you personally, or Rose or Wes, I'd still ask you the same thing. This is not an offer of charity. Your beautiful boy is dead. He's not coming back. You help me with this, and I'll get 'em all. I promise you that. All of them. Protection don't mean anything if someone can buy it out from under you. I'm sorry, brother. I'm not gonna talk about this anymore. Okay. From me to you, though, friend to friend... Talk to Rose. She is in a world of pain. This ain't on her. You gotta let it go. I've known you a long time, Declan. The one thing I know is you don't let anything go. That's why you are who you are. Thanks for the licorice. No problem. We made a partnership with the Devil's Kings. We will be setting up our new fentanyl labs in Quebec, and they will be in charge of protecting them and distribution So, you're going outside the family? When everything is in place, Luca will move to Montreal and be our go-between. You will coordinate with them on whatever they need. You think I'm gonna work for the bikers? If you want to be involved, yes, we do. You must be out of your goddamn mind, 'cause I'm not working for no bikers! You make a deal with them without talking to us? We need to move forward. And since you all failed at the job we gave you, - we found other options. - Can't trust the bikers. Well, they have agreed to find and kill Declan for us. They are eager partners now. And if they're no good, we replace them just like we would any employee. Simple! Why don't you have them over for dinner? Give them the house too! Okay, it's my godson's birthday in my cousin's house who is in prison because of you two. I don't wanna hear about any of this no more. Luca! Hey! I might have something here. - What am I looking at? - This was at the church lab. Now, remember the first time we saw the twins? I think that's the same lighter. If it is, we can get to them. Call the RCMP liaison in Italy. They have passports, so their fingerprints will be on file there. Good work, Kenny! Thank you! What are you doing here? You left our conversation early. I'm not gonna take no orders from no dirty bikers. You are not taking orders from them. You are taking orders from me. - Hmm... - Luca... you are the one that I trust, not them. I know the future that you see for yourself. The reason I am giving you a second chance is because I see it too. This reaches me and only me. If you have problems, you call me. If I call you, you answer. Now, I'm not forcing this on you. If you want, you can walk away. Do you want to walk away, Luca? ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Okay, how about some cake? I'd like to say something. - Maybe a little later. - No, I wanna say something. Thank you, everybody, for coming, my friends, my family... - Let's go. - No, let's stay. You all know these past few weeks have been very, very hard. It's true. And it's hard to be joyous in a time like this, uh, but we have to. We have to, I have to, for my son, because he needs everyone in this room. And we all love you and Adamo very much! And I'm sorry. I am so sorry. I'm... I'm not perfect. You know, I made mistakes. But I swear, the only thing I care about in this life is you. And your father loves you so much. You know what, I've never known a man who loves his child as much as he does, except maybe his father. No, that's where he learned it from. But your father's not here, so, uh, I will be both mother and father to you. I'll protect you... ...love you, and never ever leave you for the rest of your life. I promise. Okay! How about that cake, everyone? Kids first, come on. Hey! Thank you. - Guess who came to dinner? - You got them? Family's having a party, and they showed up. And they're only in one car today. The tide turns, my friend. Don't lose 'em! Ah, I won't. He's on his way. What's the matter? Ah, it's all good. Just wanna have a quick chat. - What is it? - Yeah, close the door. So, you're watching what I'm watching, right, Enzo? She's losing it, you know, a little bit. Wait a minute. We're not doing this, okay? I'm just saying she's gonna cry again. She's fine! What are we talking about this again for? I made a promise to Nats. That's that! No, your son lied to you. So any promise you made, it doesn't hold. Listen, Enzo, let me talk to you for a second. I know this is an impossible situation for you. I know. I'm your brother. I understand that. I'm just saying let me take this burden, this decision, off your shoulders. Listen to me, if we kill her, it's gonna look like we tried to shut her up. What? Look like it to who? - The cops! - The cops? Why would the cops think that? We just make it look like an accident. Enzo, why'd you say... why did you say that? They're gonna know. Why are they gonna know? - Why are they gonna know? - The cops... Yeah? Why are they gonna know? They know we know Valentina's a snitch. How do they know, Enz? How do they know, Enz? Valentina's cop paid me a visit. She told me. What? Pops, I swear I don't know nothing. Wait a minute. So, you already knew that Valentina was a snitch? The cop wanted to flip me, and I told her to kiss my ass! When I played you that awful tape, what did you do? You just pretended you didn't know? Enzo, is that... are you... Enzo, is that what happened? She didn't say anything to hurt us! Well, how do you know that? Answer me! Answer me, Enzo! How do you know that? I confronted Val! Tell me you're joking. You can't be serious. He can't be. He's not serious. Dom, I went at her hard. I'm telling you! She gave them nothing! They have nothing, trust me! We just have to, like, leave it! That's it! You lied to me? - You're not looking at it the right way. - You lied to me for her? - Not for her, for everybody. - Our whole life, you never lied to me. - That's true. - So what do you do? I needed to! - You're choosing her over me. - That's right! You're choosing her over my son, over our family? You don't understand! It's my family! Shut up and listen. Lower your voice! Lower your goddamn voice, Enz! If we don't go to jail because of her, what do you think is gonna happen when the big bosses back home find out? Do you understand? What are you not getting, Enzo? We're all gonna be dead. Dead! Got it? Ah! - Dom... - Enz. Please, Enz. I've never gone against your word my whole life, even when I disagreed. This is the one time you gotta listen to me. We will not touch her. Come on, Dom. I gotta hear you say it. I'll tell you what, um... When they come for us, and believe me, Enz, it's just a matter of time, I hope they kill you last so you can see all the damage you've done. You broke my heart, Enz. Luca, let's go. All right, let's go back to the party. Enzo, let's go. What do you want, boy? I'm not here to help you get clean, Lonny. I'm here to help you suffer. Hey! Declan. Hey! I tried talking with him yesterday. He doesn't seem all there. Yeah. He's been through a lot, but I'm gonna help him out of it. Hey! We're going for a ride. - Where? - Get in. Thanks for coming. Drive safe. I'm gonna put him to bed. It was a great party. Everything's gonna be all right, Val. I saw you guys. Talking. Always talking. You think you're so smart? Val, what are you talking about? What were you talking about in the garage? Nothing. Nothing. When you guys say "nothing," it's always a something. What is it? You know, don't you? You should go to bed. You all know. Be quiet, Val. - What's gonna happen to me? - Nothing's gonna happen to you. - Luca! - Go to sleep.- Luca, don't bullshit me. I know what's going on. Don't talk about anything. You don't know anything, okay? Come on. Come on. Go lie down. I miss Nats. You think he misses me? Of course! - He loves you! - I know. What are we doing here? My old man, he died a few days ago. - I'm sorry. - Don't be. That piece of shit was the reason me and you lost your mom. Be happy he's dead. I didn't see him for 25 years, at least. I didn't think about him. I forgot about him. He was nothing to me. But as I got older, I realized I never forgot about him at all. And he was still right up in there. I saw his face, heard his voice, his stink. Five years ago, I looked for him. When I found him, I went to visit him. Not to get amends, no apologies. I wanted to make him suffer. And that is when he left up here. Poof! Gone, like a crumbled up piece of paper. And now that he's really gone, I don't feel nothing. The man who ran the foster home that you grew up in, the guy who beat you and abused you and spit on you, he lives right over there Reggie, in that house. Why are we here? 'Cause you're gonna go in there, and you're gonna make him take back all the shit he did to you. Speak of the devil! That's him, right? Is that him? No, I don't want to. It's okay, I'm right here. You go do what you gotta do. - I wanna leave! - No, no! - We can go! - No, you gotta go in there, Reg. You gotta show him who you are. You gotta show him what a piece of garbage he really is and make him regret his whole useless life. He's just an old man! He's not just an old man. He's a monster. Reggie, are you scared to look at the house? Don't be scared. I don't want you to be scared anymore. It was a long time ago. No, it's not. It's now. You gotta fix it. - I can't. - Yes, you can. - I just can't. - Yes, you can! You don't even know me, man! I'm not like you! I'm sorry. Look, I know you're trying to help me. I totally get it. But listen to me. Just having somebody want to help me, that's the best thing that's ever happened to me. Okay? That's all I need! Thank you. I mean that. I'm so sorry for everything you had to go through. That must've been so hard. I wish you had someone like I got you. Hey... Come on, let's go home. Come on. Sleep it off. You'll feel better in the morning. You know what? Marrying into your family didn't turn out the way I thought it would. Gotcha! Val, you okay? Val? Pop, what are you doing in here? Shhh! Shhh! Don't wake the baby. Is she okay? Val? Val. Val, are you okay? Val! What... what did you do? - I'm not gonna... - What did you do? I'm not gonna let anything happen to you. NO! - What's going on? - No! What's wrong with her? Is she okay? I had no choice, Enzo. It had to be done. You need to go home. You're gonna come back. Gotta change your clothes. And, uh... call the cops in the morning. Report her missing. I did it for all of us, Enzo. You have every right to be angry with me. I promised you I'd take care of Wes. But this isn't about that. I already told Declan I made the commitment. You don't think if Nats had a chance to reunite with his son, he wouldn't sell you out? They know which side they're on. Declan and I know which side we're on. Declan is not doing this for us. I know.- We have to do this for us. You messing with my flowers? They needed a little help. I spoke to Bobby. Really? - Couldn't have been easy. - It wasn't. Probably never will be. But he sees things our way now, and you now own Nats's protection contract. So whatever you got planned better work. It will. I want you to get rid of her car. All right, you take it to Sammy's yard. He'll take care of it. I'll never forgive you. Yeah, you're gonna forgive me. Listen, when you're old and you're Grey, and you're not rotting in jail, you're gonna forgive me. Let's go. Come on, you can think later. Uh, my daughter-in-law's missing. I... I don't know where she is. I'm at the house right now. She's gone, and her car's gone. But her baby's here all alone, and she would have never have left the baby. Something must've happened! Send the cops! Send someone! Walk back to your car. This is private property. I just wanna talk. What about? We got some mutual interests to discuss. Like what? Kidnapping? Fentanyl house? Take a seat! If you wanna be my CI, we can continue this down at my office. It's not my style. What do you want? One day soon, a gift will be presented to you. It's gonna drop on your lap. Don't question it. Are you offering me a bribe? I wouldn't dare. Just here to tell you that you're on the right track. Everything's gonna happen for you soon. You didn't have to tell me any of this. Why are you really here? I wanted to meet you, see what kind of a person you really are. And what kind am I? Just like me. The kind that likes to win. Next time on Bad Blood... - Security's top level. - How do I get in? You two children are the reason for this mess. There's only one way to fix this. A missing persons report was filed by Enzo Cosoleto for Valentina. You know, who does this? Leaves a baby alone? Does she have any issues with mental illness? Oh yeah. She's depressed. Hi, Enzo! I came to talk to you. 'Cause I believe you're the last clear-thinking man of your family. I know where they are. Okay. What's next? I got one shot at this. If I miss, then they're gonna send an army at me.
