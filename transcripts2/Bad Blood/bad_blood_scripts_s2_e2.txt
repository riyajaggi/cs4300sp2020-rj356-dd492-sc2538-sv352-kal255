 [Declan] Previously on Bad Blood. All of you are now gonna buy your drugs from me. Declan. There is Jorge. [Declan] One of the most feared cartel bosses in the world. One hundred kilos to start. You'll have seven days to come up with my money. But if anything goes wrong, you know what'll happen to you. - Who's that? - [Nellie] The 'Ndrangheta bosses. Every month, they gather to report on their businesses. I have a CI who told me about the meeting. I wanna know about the newcomers.

 They're cousins from Calabria. [Valentina] Teresa and Christian Langana. We are here to help us all grow. - We gotta go along with it. - They kinda scare me, Domenic. They will be easy enough to replace. Domenic wants to set a meet with Declan. - New family here from Italy. - Keep me posted. We want you to be our partner in Montreal. I don't work for anyone. I got the address for the rooming house I'm staying at. You're my nephew. You're staying with me. [Rose] I've run contraband for over a decade. I'm wondering if you're up for moving something other than cigarettes. I'll think about it.

 My driver is standing by. Standing by? They just picked it up already. - We will hold onto your shipment. - Where's my load? Our offer is still on the table for another 24 hours. You wanna tell me how the hell this happened? Go ahead. Tell me. They had the PIN numbers. Once they were on the docks... Stop! How... did... this... happen? This. It's a remote-access receiver. And, Frank, my port supervisor got turned by the twins. [man] That greedy bastard slipped the device into our server. Once this was plugged into the computer, someone must've been nearby with a laptop. They had full access to the system. They just lifted the PIN number. They took your shipment. Declan, I'm so sorry. This is state-of-the-art stuff. - The city spent 10 million installing it... - State-of-the-art stuff? A $4 piece of plastic and a rat beat your system. You, you went against me for some extra cash. You went with them against me. [whimpering] You don't get to go that easy. You keep a hold of him. He'll be useful to me later. - But Declan that's my car... - This happened on your watch. You be grateful you're not in the trunk with him. Okay, I'll take care of him. [Declan] Five million dollars of product gone? It didn't just disappear. I'll pay 100 grand to anyone who gets me a location on my load. These freaks are in from Italy. A brother and sister. Yeah, that's right. Domenic is now taking orders. Tell the Russians I'll let them have full access to the dock, they've been begging me for it, if they find me a location. - Wanna get a smoke? - Not now, Reggie. Not now. I pay you to get me information. I don't care. Shake down your CIs, right? Get police records, wiretaps. Just do your job. [phone ringing] Hola. [Declan] I was expecting your call. I'm just calling to remind you the payment is due in seven days. You received everything? - Yeah. - Good. We will be in touch with the details where to bring the money. - You got it. - Very well. I'll let you go now. I'm sure you are... very busy. Bye. [phone vibrating] [phone beeping] What? [Teresa] Hello, Declan. I know this must all feel a little, uh... heavy-handed, but... time was of the essence. If you've reconsidered our offer, we will return your shipment, no hard feelings. I still think we could do great things together. You haven't been doing this very long, have you? This job. Because if you had, you'd know it's all about how you read people. How hard to push, when to play nice. And you... you've read me all wrong. [phone beeps] [Reggie] Hey, man. You okay? Yeah, yeah. [sighs] [gunfire] [Reggie] Ah! Reggie! Stay down! [panting] [yelps] Reggie! Get in the back room! [panting] You okay? Come on, down in the hole. I need you to focus. We're getting out of here right now. Go around. This is the only reason why I bought this house. Come on, come on. [Siro] Christian, clear. [Reggie panting] Stay low, stay low. Keep moving your legs. Come on, come on. That's it. Come on, come on. Head over to the trees, all right? [Christian] Declan! Come out! You wanna go in? Let him burn. [explosion] [theme music playing] [breathing heavily] Oh, not again. No! Hey. What are you doing? Why'd you stop? Come on. [grunting, breathing heavily] Hey, man, are you hurt? What's going on, Reg? Look at me. Hey, hey. Hey, come on. You're okay, you're okay. - Yeah. - Just... Just breathe. Breathe. You're all right. Hey, hey. Look at me. Look at me. - Yeah. - Well, what's wrong? I get attacks. I got meds for them. - You got them on you now? - They're at the house. Okay, we'll get you more. Don't worry about that. Look at me. You're safe now. You're okay, man. You're all right. Look at me. You're with me. There's no one following us. Listen, I got a car not too far from here. - We gotta get to it. Walk with me, yeah? - Yeah. - Follow me. Come on, keep it up. - Yes. Yeah.

[Domenic] You do it for the both of us. ♪ I believe that I'll figure it out ♪ ♪ I'll figure it out till I'm done ♪ [Teresa] Good day, everyone. [Nats] You ever been here before? [Luca] Why would I ever be here? The fruit here, it's terrible. Well, there's not a lot of orange groves near Hamilton, so... All of it. Everything I've tried. Dry, tasteless. It's like taking medicine. What are we, uh... What are we doing here? First, let's take a moment to celebrate. We are now in possession of Declan's entire shipment. Good work. Ah, we can unload that all in a week. What a profit. We are not going to sell it here. Why not? We are going to sell it back to its original intended buyers. And with Declan now eliminated, we are going to flood the market in Montreal with Declan's own supply, cut the going rate by ten percent, make us a welcome arrival. [Christian] We'll go over the details later. But, uh, now, we have another matter to discuss. Teresa and I, we want to know why it is that you have not expanded into fentanyl. [scoffing] - I've been saying the same thing. - Take it easy. Is there a problem? It's, uh... It's too hot right now. It's in all the papers all the time. Hundred people overdose on heroin, no one cares anymore. One kid... on fentanyl? Front-page news. And another reason. I don't like it. It's dirty. It's not for people like us. [Teresa clears throat] A ball of fentanyl this size is worth... 20 million. Now imagine five of these. You can produce it locally and fit it in a backpack. Wait. What about our coke and heroin? A gram of cocaine, on average, sells for... eighty dollars. If you do the calculations, and we have, with your bulk-purchase price, your export fees, the bribes to police, customs, and so forth, your remaining profit on that is $12. Fentanyl is 100 times more potent than cocaine. We will cut 80% of the cocaine out of that gram, add two grains of fentanyl to make up for potency. The rest is filler. Our profits just went from $12 to $50 a gram. That's a 400% increase. Diversify product, increase profits. Any questions? - Well, when do we start? - [Enzo] Wait, wait. People are dying from this because it's too strong. You're gonna kill off our customers. There will be some casualties because of the potency, but this is nothing more than a simple manufacturing adjustment. This is the future. Where are you gonna make it? You're standing in it. [Domenic] A church? [Teresa] No one will notice a thing. [Luca] Can you believe it? They killed Declan. [Domenic] Yeah, I'll believe it when I see it. Yeah, this fentanyl business, I don't care how much money is in it. Coke, heroin, that's one thing. People know how to use that. [Nats] Mint? But selling them coke and giving them this, that's just asking for the cops to come down on us. - I don't want any part of this. - Good. Let me and Nats run it. We'll make a fortune. - I dunno about that. Pops made a point... - Take a beat, shut up. You're not gonna do anything, and you're gonna do what I tell you. Enzo, one thing you're right, it's a dirty drug. I agree with you. I don't like it. But this is what the bosses back home want, right? So we're gonna do it right if we do it. Hey, don't forget, I gotta stop by the hardware store on King Street, - pick up some light bulbs. - I got light bulbs with you two weeks ago. Yeah, I need more. You got a problem with that? Zio, he likes it bright all the time. I'm not kidding. I go for dinner, I leave with a tan like George Hamilton. - A dark house is depressing. - You're throwing money down the toilet. If you're not in a room, turn off the lights. Is it your money? Are you paying for it? Shut up about it. Hey, according to the Wonder Twins, money's not gonna be an issue anymore, Zio. Don't be so quick to trust them, Luca. Those ice cubes didn't come here to make you rich. [siren wailing] - [Reggie] What are we doing here? - You're gonna check in. - What about you? - No, not yet. Those guys are still looking for you, right? I know. Don't worry about those guys. It's gonna be fine. Everything's gonna be just fine. - But I got some business to handle. - No. No. I wanna stay with you. - No. - Can I just stay with you, please? Not yet. Take this money, check in. Text me what meds you're taking. I'm gonna pick 'em up for you, all right? I'm such a problem for you. - I'm such... - No, you're not a problem. - I'm so sorry. - No, look at me, look at me. You're not a problem. This is all gonna work out just fine. Now go check in. [Reggie sighs] Just get a room? Yeah. I'll see you soon. Go on. Fine. Text me those meds. Okay. [bird squawking] [shop bell jingles] [indistinct chatter] You gotta give me more notice. - How many goddamn manicures can I get? - Sit down. What do you have for me? [scoffs] Nothing. I just saw you. Nothing? He's talked about nothing? You wanna know about his sore back or his bloated feet? We have an arrangement here. Yeah, well, you know what? I'm getting sick of it. - Hmm. - I did my research. What you're doing is illegal. And if anything happens to me, you'd go to jail. I don't think you have a clear understanding of your situation. What do you think happens to mob wives who cheat on their husbands and rat on them to the cops? If I choose to tell Nats, they kill you. Your mob family won't think twice. You think Dom and Enzo are gonna stand by the whore-rat wife? So, when I say jump, you pole-vault Olympic heights. If you don't have anything, you get something. You're married to the one capo who actually wants to share his feelings with his wife. Consider yourself lucky. Most of them just screw you on Sunday and beat you on Monday when breakfast is cold. But you're right about one thing. I don't wanna have to keep calling you. Next time, you call me with something. Now go. [door opens] [door closes] What? That was good. [streetcar bell clanging] Sorry I'm late. I need you to find two people for me. Let me guess, twins? Word travels. Everyone's talking about the new bosses in Ontario, but no one has seen 'em. You have any pictures, names? Teresa and Christian Langana. I got no pictures, but you can't miss 'em. They're Prada Euro-punks. Follow the Cosoleto brothers and their sons. They're gonna have to meet. That's triple your rate. Find those twins. - You got it, boss. - One more thing. I got a nephew. He's holed up in a hotel. He's out of his meds. These are what they are and the address. Get them to him. - Didn't know you had any family. - Neither did I. This cream smells like grapefruits. Why would I want my feet to smell like some sour fruit? Citrus is good for your skin. This bottle was 18 bucks. I could just rub oranges on them, then, no? - Get a whole bag for, like, 5.99. - I don't know, Nats. I don't know. Something bothering you? Just... Just have a headache. You wanna hear about a headache? The prince and princess, they want us to move into fentanyl. You know what that is? It's like heroin, but a million times stronger, okay? A few grains of this stuff can kill someone. Pops and Domenic don't wanna do it, but Luca thinks it's a good idea. - Of course, he wants him and I to run... - Stop! Stop telling... Stop... Stop talking. - Why, what's wrong? - [sighs] Just stop telling me about your business. I don't wanna know. Where's this coming from? Nobody tells their wives about their business. There's a reason for that. You know? I'm not supposed to know. But I tell you everything. I mean... I like to talk to you, you know? Well, maybe you shouldn't. Well, then, who should I talk to, huh? You're my wife. I don't wanna keep things from you. [Valentina clicks tongue] - I appreciate that. - Yeah? What's wrong? You grew up with this shit. I didn't. I... It's stuff normal people don't have to think about. Look, you knew about my family before we even met. And I've never kept anything from you. And I think you even used to kind of like that, no? Some days, don't you just want... just a normal, regular life? Isn't that what we have? Hmm? [inhales sharply] [dog barking in distance] [lighter clicking] Goddammit. [siren wailing in distance] [whistling] Hey, Domenic. You need a guard dog. You're looking good. Yeah, I been working out a little bit. How about you? I heard you were dead. Nah. [smacks lips] We've known each other a long time. You stayed away from my city. I've stayed away from your city. Everything was okay, right? So... I can't figure out why you're going along with all this. You can't figure out why I'd wanna run you out of business? Maybe you need a new accountant. That's funny. 'Cause I know you. I know that you don't like headaches. So if you don't give me back my drugs, then this whole thing's gonna turn into a headache that rips your head off. Now, that's funny. You know, from where I'm standing, looks like you're the one with the problem. Why are you taking orders from these two? I don't take orders. Domenic, come on. Everybody knows that those two beauty freaks are in control now. That can't taste good. After being the boss for so long. But maybe I'm wrong. Maybe you... have expanded your palate... into kissing ass. We took your drugs. We're gonna take your city. I'm here because we have history, you and me. So, let me give you some advice. You know me. You know what I can do. Walk away, Domenic. Walk away. You can do that. Otherwise, they're just gonna march you straight into the fire and watch you burn. Allow me to give you some honest advice. These aren't some rich, spoiled brats who are, you know, here to party with the Kardashians. Their father is the boss. I mean the boss of it all. You understand? He gave 'em a job to do. They're not gonna fail him. They just made your 100 keys disappear. So if we go to war, Declan, that decision, that's gonna be all you, my friend. This ain't Vito you're dealing with. These people, they don't... they don't got soft spots. They don't lose. Neither do I. [tense music playing] [Declan] The twins took my drugs. They tried to kill me. But I'll be damned if I let them take my town. So if I didn't get my drugs back, and back fast, the cartel would achieve what the twins couldn't. So, how's things at home, Declan? - [Declan] That's funny. - Why are we here? - [thunder rumbles] - I know... Teresa and Christian have offered to sell you all of my shipment. - And at a damn good price. - [Declan] Don't buy from them. - [chuckles] - They're not here to sell. They're here to take over. You buy, you open the door for them to walk right into our house. They're coming for you, not us. I'm not getting involved in your shit. I need product. You can't deliver on what you promised, so I'm gonna get it somewhere. Well, I can't deliver because they stole from me, which is like stealing from you. Those twins are here to divide and conquer our city. If we don't hold 'em off now, in six months, you'll all be dead and gone. So now it's "our city"? The way I see it, you're the only one with the problem here. No one is running me out of my town. You need a friend, get a goddamn dog. It's because of that winning personality, you're really gonna go places. Screw you. Junior? Why should I get into your war? Hey, it's your war, too. You just can't see it yet. If I don't have product to move, Liam or Alex are going to do it on my territory. You got good product, call me. But I got to stay open for business, man. Sorry. Why so quiet, Alex? Well... You and me are not friends. I don't give a shit about helping you. But you're right on this one. And it's me they'll be coming for after you. Yeah. But I also need product to move, so what are you gonna do about that? When are they delivering it to you? In a few days. They're handing off to everyone at the same spot. I got a plan. It's gonna work for you and me. Big time. [Ken] I can't get this thing to print. Do I need a password or something? [Ken] Nellie. Nellie! You're cutting my funding? You have a problem, follow protocol. Take it to your supervisor. Why? All he's gonna do is put it in a memo for you. Tell it to my face. I have the most significant CI in the Mafia in the last five years, and you wanna cut me off now? You've been running this for how long and what have you gotten? - A few drug busts... - You gave Mike more money in his division. You gave Patrick more in his division. Terrorism and cybercrime. No one cares about gangsters killing gangsters. But they care if their subways get blown up or their bank accounts get hacked. You want more funding, bring me something the mayor can campaign on, something the commissioner can hold a press conference about. That's all they care about. Now get out before you say something I have to suspend you for. What do you want? Have a nice day, sir. [door buzzing] [door buzzing, opening] [Rose] I've missed you. Yeah. So, where's my boy? Where's Wes? He didn't wanna come. [sighs] - He said he was... - It's all right. Just... Just fill me in on the business. How'd the meeting go with Declan? I made a deal. He's giving us good terms. But he just got into a war with the 'Ndrangheta. Yeah. Yeah, I heard. You're running the show now, sis. It's your call. But, you know, if I was gonna bet on any horse, even odds against him, I'd bet on Declan. - Gabriel, let's go. - Where? The drop, getting our load from the twins. Give me your phone. Why? I said no phone. No phones. [Declan] Everyone is brought down by someone on the inside. But I couldn't let that happen. I needed the bikers. And if I had a hope in hell to make this work, I also needed reinforcements. Boys. - So, what's the gig? - I'll tell you when we get there. What gear d'you bring? Heavy metal. Precision action. - What do we need? - All of it. Let's go. - [Junior] What time you got? - [sighs] Five more minutes. [motorcycles approaching] Looks like we're all in. [Liam] So? [Alex] Can't stop the winds of change. Or the smell of shit. [Liam] You met these twins? [Alex] No. - [Liam] Think they'll show up? - [Alex] I don't know. [phones ringing] They gave me a new location. Two miles south. - Me too. - [Alex] Where? Three miles west. [Liam] What about you? Nothing. They're splitting us up. You gonna go? Don't have much of a choice. [sighs] [Liam] See you on the other side. What the hell? [Declan] What's going on? - What do we do? - We wait. We still have our target. [Declan] That must be them. [tense music playing] So, where did the others go? Don't worry about their business. We got your stuff. Teresa and Christian coming? [man] No, you get me. So you guys got the money? Mm-hmm. Bring it over. Get ready. I'll take it on good faith that it's all there. It's all there. - Now. - [gunshot] [shouting] [motorcycle engine revving] Let's go. Let's go. [groans] Don't move! Goddammit. - Where's the rest of it? - I don't know. What? What? I don't know! - [Declan] You don't know? - I swear on my mother, I don't know. - I don't know, I swear. - I'm done with you. All they said was they were gonna switch up the drops on everyone. That's it. It's all I know. I swear. Please. [groaning] [Declan] It's your lucky day. You are gonna go tell Teresa and Christian... - Mm-hmm? - ...that this was Declan who done this. - And I'm coming for them. - [grunts] - Got it? - [grunts] Go. Go. Go, go, go, go, go, go. [running footsteps] Is this sexy enough for you? Because that looks like a terrorist attack to me. Shootout in a cement plant, two bodies, including my informant. This is just the beginning. This is war. Oh, and the owner of the cement plant is friends with the Minister of Finance. You got four weeks. Show me something. [suspenseful music playing] - [Alex] You saw? - I did. They changed everyone's drop points at the last minute, split us all up. - Lucky they didn't move us. - That right? - What did you score? - A fifth of my load. - And we still got a deal? - Yeah. Sixty percent of our original cost. That's what we said. I know what the deal was, Alex. It's all there. C'est beau. Best part of the night was you taking out Gabriel, by the way. Thanks for tipping me off about him. He could have really hurt my operation. Goddamn rat... Snitching to the cops. So, now what? You saw what I did. I sent them back a witness. He's gonna tell them everything. He's gonna tell them I took out one of your guys too, so you're gonna look clean. Hey, they're gonna come back to you. You stay open to them. I need somebody to stay close with them. - All right. What about the Irish? - What about 'em? - The Haitians? - Who cares? They're gonna believe you were planning to rip them off too. I'm just saying, you're not making any friends with this play, Declan. I don't need any friends. I got guns. Everybody out. Let's go. Wait here. Tell them what happened. We went to the drop like we were told. It was just us and the bikers. And then bam. Someone started shooting. They blew away one of the bikers, then they killed one of my guys, Marco. Me and Gino fired back, but they had machine guns. How did you get out? Declan let me go. To send you a message. He told me to tell you that, uh... he's coming for you. How many men did Declan have with him? I don't know. I saw maybe two or three. But there must have been more hiding. Who was shot first? The biker, then Marco. Did the bikers shoot back? Yeah. What is this, you don't believe me? - Domenic. - I want you to take it easy. All right? We just wanna know what happened. No one's questioning your loyalty here. Am I right? So, how did Declan know about the drop? [Domenic] Sounds like one of the gangs, but that could've been anybody. You think the bikers were in on it? No, he was trying to kill them, too. [Teresa grunts] [Teresa pants] I want you to find Declan. This needs to end. I want him dead. [cell phone ringing] - Hello? - [Declan] Hey. How's it going, sunshine? I'm... I'm good. I'm good. - Uh, where are you? - Oh, I'm moving around. - You got your meds? - Yeah, yeah. Um, your friend came and left them at the front desk. So I got 'em. Easy. Thank you. Um, are you gonna come get me now? Ready to go. Hey, look, you gotta hold tight, okay? Yeah, but, like, why don't you just come get me? I'll help you. I don't wanna be here anymore. You okay? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I'm totally cool. It's just, um, you know, it'd be better if I was hanging with you again. Reggie, tell me something. In the woods, what happened? What's going on with you? I have, like, a condition. I got a few of 'em, actually. I take my meds and that helps. It's gotten a lot better. The gu... gunfire and shit didn't help. [chuckles] I'm sure it didn't. Look, I'm gonna come get you soon. I promise, all right? Yeah. Hey, you got that parole meeting. You can't miss it. You go and you get right back to the hotel. You stay put. You got it? Yeah, got it. What about you? Where are you staying? Hey, I'm taking care of things. It's gonna be okay. I'll see ya. [sighs] [tense music playing] [crickets chirping] Wes. Hey. You gotta go see your dad. Prison is a lonely place. [Rose] He really misses you. The least you can do is go see him once a month. Go inside. [car door opens] In the neighborhood? I'm, uh... I'm suddenly needing a place to stay, Rose. No one's gonna look for me here. I'm not asking for something for nothing. Extra half percent on our deal. All right. You can stay in that outbuilding over there. Thanks. [gun cocking] Don't move, Declan. We have heard of your little problems. My employer sent me to remind you that our payment deadline is still the same date. Jorge Ramirez does not listen to excuses. Not a day late, not an hour, not a minute. Understood. Good. Very good. I'll be around. Just to make sure that you stick to our agreement. And if you don't, we're gonna be seeing each other soon. Adios. [phone vibrating] [treadmill beeps] [sighs] Yes, Domenic. [Domenic] You wanted a war with Declan, you got one. I just found your port contact's head in my barbecue. Did you hear what I just said? Yes. I will take care of this. Started looking for a job? What? - You started looking for a job? - No, uh, not yet. I'm going to, though. All right. Keep a log of every place you apply to, okay? Business name, address, phone number, contact. - I'll be checking it. - Okay. - Taking your meds? - Yeah. Klonopin, Effexor, Norpramin? - Mm-hmm. - Mm? All right, okay. Sign there. See me in four weeks. [grunting] [muffled yelling] [tires screeching] [Declan] Next time on Bad Blood. Teresa and Christian, they kidnapped someone very important to me. Now I have to stop them. Tell us where he is, and all this can be over. Teresa and Christian? - Yeah. - This is good work, Val. I'm not putting this gun down - until you tell me where Reggie is. - Do what you think is right. What are we gonna do, shoot each other? This is not what family does. You see what this animal is doing to us? I want this mess between us to be over with. Until then, the torture continues. You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna kill you and your brother, and then I'm gonna take everything you've got.
