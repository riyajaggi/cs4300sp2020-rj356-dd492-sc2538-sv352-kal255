No. [clears throat] They're trying to steal my graphics and steal my look, and now they're trying to steal my people. - [reporter 2 laughs] - [producer] In three... two...

 [reporter 1] ...pushing his theme of the week, - which is... - [baby fussing] [newscast continues indistinctly] [Dianne] We need to talk about O'Reilly. Ugh, all right. How much is that gonna cost us to settle? 150 K. 150 K for a junior producer, really? What, did he get handsy or something? No, just talk. She gets that 'cause she can't handle a little newsroom banter? That's... Look, I know O'Reilly is a pain in the ass, but look at his numbers. Just take care of it. - I'm on it. - [cell phone ringing] Yeah? [Jon Scott] Can you think of any reason for a pilot to slam into a building of this height on a day like today if it wasn't intentional? [NTSB investigator] Well, it could've been, uh, some inattention. I-I wouldn't rule that out. [Jon Scott] Um, I am reminded of a couple of things that happened recently, Dr. Gross, not long ago, uh, just a couple-- within the last couple of weeks, in fact, uh, there was a pilot... Look! Look! There goes another one. We just saw... We just saw another one. - We just saw another one... - [Roger] What the fuck? - ...apparently go... - Jesus Christ. Another plane just flew... Second plane... - Roger? - [Roger] I know. I know, I know. Get Judy on the phone. J-Judy, get Beth. Get Beth on the phone. Just tell her, just don't move, just stay where she is. I want to get a camera on the roof. I want Shep... I want to get Shep up there on the roof. Just get everybody downstairs, everybody downstairs right now. Right away! Right away! [Jon Scott] Eric, I know you have a lot of sources at the FBI and other agencies... Sports scores are still running. Kill the sports feed! [distant siren whooping] [distorted newscast] [distorted, overlapping voices] [reporter] ...the two towers of the World Trade... [overlapping chatter] [reporter] And there is smoke pouring out of The Pentagon. It would appear that there has been another major... [indistinct newscast] [sirens wailing] Uh, step in so we can frame up. [jet engines whooshing] This is Islamic terrorism, al-Qaeda. None of us know for sure yet. W-W-We're trying to get confirmation... [Roger] Somebody just flew two jumbo jets into the World Trade Center. Another one into The Pentagon. The biggest suicide bombs ever. Who do you think it was? The fucking Quakers? Roger, let the other networks say al-Qaeda first, like we did with Lewinsky and Clinton. This is not about blow jobs getting us ratings, John. - We're under attack. - [Roger] He's right. We don't know what else can happen today. There could be more planes, could be subway attacks, dirty bombs. We have to be prepared for anything. It's not over. We need a new graphics package. Splashy. I want it to say "America at War." Chet, talk to me about on-screen updates. Uh... There's a lot of noise, uh, panic. Flights grounded, Air Force scrambled. [Roger] Get it all up there. [Shine] There's only so much room on-on-screen, Roger. Well, let's do it like we do sports scores, uh, but keep it moving, like it's a Wall Street ticker tape. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - Yeah, update after update. Everybody needs to know what's happening. Who we got coming in, John? Uh, some phones are down. We're having trouble getting in touch with anybody in D.C. or south of Houston. You know what? Just get every NatSec expert we've got. You just put them on hold for the whole goddamn day. You make it an exclusive hold if you have to. This is gonna be a day that defines us, as a country and as a people, and we just all need to be at our very best. [indistinct chatter] - Bill, just give me a minute. - Yeah. I need you to back up Chet today. All right? You know I love the guy, but I think he's lost a step, so just make sure we don't drop anything. - I'm on it. - Thank you. Roger, you need anything? [door closes] [door opens] Rupert. It's madness. All of it. Madness. Are we ready? We are in control. Everything's up and running. If we lose power, the D.C. bureau is ready to take over. - Dear God. - [woman on TV] Oh, my God! [reporter] We're not sure exactly what happened, but there was another explosion on the far side of one of the buildings... [newscast continues indistinctly] [reporter] It appears that the World Trade Center... [overlapping, indistinct newscasts] [indistinct newscasts continue] ♪ tense music ♪ ♪♪ [reporter] ...could be, as-as a consequence of, uh... of perhaps something falling from it. It certainly looks like an awful lot of smoke. There's another plane. Where? United 93 is down in a field in Pennsylvania. And we're watching that? [stammering] Things are moving pretty fast. Look, just put up a shot of the tower. That's what everyone needs to see. Just run it on a loop all day. We can't just show the same thing over and over. It's not a regular news day. This is Pearl fucking Harbor. [frantic chatter on TV] - [sighing] - [Chet] Fuck. Do we even have anything else? [Shine] They, um, uh, shut down Pennsylvania Avenue, evacu... No, not words. Images, visuals. What do we got? [Moody] Uh, jumpers. What? From the North Tower. Jumpers. Let's see that. All right, patch it through to the war room. [gasping] [Brian] Oh, Jesus. Does anybody else have this footage? [Moody] If they do, they haven't aired it. We can't put that on the air. At least not yet. It's too soon. Run it. We need everyone in the goddamn world to see what these animals have done to us. Run it. [Roger] I'm leaving the office now. I'll be there as soon as I can. Just keep the windows closed. Don't open that door till I get home. All right. I love you, too. Judy. I need a fresh shirt. I got to freshen up. I'm going home. Judy!

I told him he could stay here. I, uh, hope I'm not an imposition. - Come in. - Of course not. Here you go, Rupert. Oh, thank you. I'll just make up the guest room. Thank you. Ah. Thanks for this, Roger. I know it's a little unorthodox, but... Oh, no, not today. The ground shifted. I'm just gonna go and check on my boy. Yeah, of course. [gasping] Why did you bring him here? Why did you bring him here? Beth, he's got an apartment downtown. What did you expect me to do, make him camp in the office? - [Beth] What if he's a target? - [Roger] Come on. [Beth] People, Roger, there are people that want to hurt him and hurt you. - We need protection. - Beth, calm down. - Calm down. - You're in Manhattan every day. Zac and I are just here by ourselves. He's just a baby. - Nothing can happen to him. - Beth... I'm gonna keep you safe. Both of you. Okay? - Okay. - Come on. Okay, you take Zac. I'm gonna go and see Rupert. Just stay calm. - Sorry about that. - [Murdoch] That's okay. Always so perfect when they're asleep, eh? [chuckles] Always. Yeah, but wait till they get older, mate. Women, drink, power. They see everything that we've got, and then they want it all. They're gonna need our help, you know. To get through this. If we get through this. Oh, we will. I tell you, those dirtbags, they've got no idea what they started. They're gonna get obliterated, crushed. We're gonna turn their fucking cave houses into sand. Fox News... ...we got a big job ahead of us. Yeah, but this is no time for politics. It's way past politics. It's war. And I'm gonna make goddamn sure that my son... he doesn't have to inherit some fucked-up towel-head terrorist world. We got a big part to play. This is our time, Rupert. This is our time. [George W. Bush on TV] And I want you all to know that America today... America today... [Laurie] So, for Fox News Sunday, I was looking at booking James Clapper. He's a Democrat who only dresses like a Republican. I'm not interested. - Ex-head of the DIA. - Next. I think booking him would be help-- Fine. Um... We can get Richard Clarke, NSC's counterterrorism lead. Oh, you mean the guy who didn't know that Osama bin Laden was gonna hijack four planes and fucking crash 'em into shit? - No, thanks. - [cheering on TV] [George W. Bush on TV] I can hear you. The rest of the world hears you. - And the people... - [people cheering] And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon. - [crowd cheering] - [knock, door opens] - [Judy] Roger? - Not now. It's Karl Rove on two. [crowd on TV] USA! USA! USA! Go. [sound muted] - [sighs] - [door opens] [door closes] Good morning, Karl. [Rove] Hello, Roger. You watching the speech? I am, actually. Optics look great. I spoke with the president. We'd like your help moving forward. Whatever you need, Karl. [Rove] Now, this event is a national tragedy. But it is an opportunity to achieve a strategic objective. - Iraq? - Yes. You want to go back? The president feels there's unfinished business. I agree. Now, we'd have to message this correctly. It's a new kind of war. It will be an international mission. A worldwide hunt to destroy terrorism. - Exactly. - You know, Rove, my take on this: If the president steps up, if the president takes the harshest possible measures... ...the country will back him. Fox News will back him. Can you put some thoughts down on paper for the president? I think your messaging would help move things forward. Absolutely, Karl. Be my pleasure. Thank you, Roger. Have a good day. Judy, bring a pad. [Roger] The way I see it is that we are actually in the middle of a war. A war whose parameters we're only just beginning to fully understand. I think, uh, previous administrations left the job undone, which gives this administration a chance to reverse that. This is a war that needs to be fought on all fronts. Whoever harbors terrorists, they share the guilt for any acts they commit. - Roger, good to see you. - Mr. Vice President. [Roger] It is an honor to be here. I want to thank you for all the work you're doing. I appreciate that, sir. - You're a patriot, Roger. - [chuckles] September 11 was a day like no other. We are dealing with evil people who hide in the shadows planning unimaginable violence and destruction. And I know there is not a man or woman in this room who does not wait on the day that justice will be delivered. And it will be delivered. There is... There is no neutral ground. Those who harbor terrorists share guilt for the acts they commit. This is a worldwide hunt to destroy terrorism. Whoever supports terrorists will be regarded as hostile to the United States. We have no alternative but to meet the enemy where he dwells. We did not ask for this trial, but it has come, and we will see it through to victory. [cheering] [Roger] Everybody? Everybody listen up. Gather round. Everyone. Come on. Come on. Come on. We may potentially... have anthrax in the building. Now, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Please wait. A package was delivered upstairs to the New York Post on the tenth floor; an envelope with an as yet unidentified white powder. And, Kasima, go and tell the control room I need somebody outside. We're gonna go live as soon as possible. You, you had an anthrax expert. What's his name? Simone? Whatever the fuck his name was, get him, all right, book him. He was good. Reach out, Anders, to the National Enquirer. They got an envelope, too. I want to just get a human angle on it. - Mr. Ailes? - Yeah? If there's anthrax, shouldn't we clear the building? No, it's o-- Look. I have been reliably informed that we're okay down here. Roger. Anthrax, Lachlan. We have a situation. Yeah, I know. It's being handled. Handled? I just walked in here. Nobody here knew anything about it. Roger, the letter was received at the Post, a dozen floors away, and it's been sealed. The authorities have been notified. Is that right? You leaving my people down here, unprotected and uninformed in an emergency? We have protocols to follow. You need to calm down. Calm down? You're telling me to calm down? We have the situation well in hand. We?! We don't have anything. I run Fox News, not you. I am the deputy chief operating officer of News Corp. News Corp owns Fox News. I don't care if you think you're Jesus Christ Almighty. - I will do anything... - [bangs table] necessary to protect my people. [chuckles] We all care about the safety of our people, Roger. Yelling about it doesn't make you a better manager. This is my operation, my people and my responsibility. One thing I don't need is some schoolboy coming down here, telling me how to do my job. You need to pull yourself together, mate. [Beth] You're a hero, Roger, protecting your people that way. That was chemical warfare. You did the right thing, but you need to get ahead of it now. How's that? Rupert will give you all the rope in the world, but he won't stand for someone disrespecting his boys. What, so you think I should apologize? For doing the right thing? No, not apologize, but you need to go to Rupert, remind him of your value. What about Lachlan? Oh, forget Lachlan. You have all the leverage. Fox is about to pass CNN. You're giving him the number one cable news network on the planet. That's all he cares about. Yeah. Good. That's good. What about next time? What if it's biological or nuclear? [sighs] We're 20 miles from the city. Please. 20 miles is nothing, Roger. You know that. The wind and the river. We're just... we're too close. [Zac crying over monitor] Nothing can happen to him. [elevator bell chimes] No snacks? [chuckles] [Murdoch] I eat in the dining room. Right. So, Lachlan. You were out of line, Roger. It was exceptional circumstances. This is a family company. My father passed it along to me, and I intend to do the same for my children. [sighs] Lachlan's young. He has ideas. He wants to do things his own way. When he tries to prevent me from doing my job, uh, what am I supposed to do with that, Rupert? You're supposed to get along with him. I've tried. Oh, come on. [chuckles] Your boy just doesn't like me. I think he hates me. Uh, I hardly think he hates you, Roger. But I'm-I'm not gonna get between you two. Okay? Well, you shouldn't. I mean, he's your son. I respect that. [exhales] Rupert, I think, given the circumstances, uh, maybe he should run things. I can take a step back. He'll be able to get Fox News over the line. I'm-I'm sure he will do a fine job. Uh... I'm not suggesting he take a lead role. Just do your job. I'll talk to Lachlan. I'm sure the whole thing is just a misunderstanding. Oh, well, I'm not... I'm not s-sure about that at all. No. No one underestimates what you mean to this company, Roger. Not me, not Lachlan. It would be nice to hear him say that just once in a while. Not, you know... I don't need continuous praise, but... Lachlan understands that the company comes first. I'm sure he's gonna talk to you. Just stay focused on Fox. All right? All right. [horns honking, sirens wailing] [Roger] When they brought those towers down... ...I believe they thought they could inject so much fear into our hearts that they would shut us down. And that our great country would become impotent. That's not gonna happen. This is a war between good and evil, and we... we are not gonna be afraid to call it exactly that. And we should never be afraid of patriotism. Now, I want all of you to start wearing one of these. You step into the building, you're wearing a flag. You go on air, you're wearing the flag. You're screwing a hooker in a cheap motel? Wear the flag, Phil. [laughter] - Okay. - Now, I got this today. CNN have had a spike in the ratings, and that is just not good for us. Now, they have three times as many employees, they have five times as many foreign bureaus, but we have something that CNN don't have. Resolve. We're gonna be fair, we're gonna be accurate, and we're gonna put American values first. CNN are gonna want to please and appease the rest of the world. And we don't give a fuck. Let them do that. Let them do that, because we stand with America! - [cheering, applause] - Yeah! We're gonna tell people what they need to hear, we're gonna bring them the truth, and we're gonna fucking win! We're gonna win! [cheering] Get those flags. Take those flags out. [Roger] We need to drive the news. Not just cover it. I need you to focus on al-Qaeda, and I need you to focus on Iraq. [Moody] Oh, but there's... there's no connection there. N-Not between Saddam and al-Qaeda. You know, there's new information coming out of the White House every hour. Roger, we... we cannot be seen to be running Bush's propaganda machine. That's just not our job. If anybody's got a problem with anything I just said, you need to go for a stroll through Lower Manhattan. It's still burning. These discussions, they stay in this room. Leakers will be punished. Don't make me doubt you. Not now. ♪ tense, atmospheric music ♪ [Roger] You hear anything, a negative thought, a negative whisper, a negative cough, you let me know. Of course. See, press this button, you can toggle between views. Uh-huh. Anywhere I can't see? [Warren] Private offices and bathrooms. Everything else is covered. Why not the bathrooms? It's sort of inappropriate? What about if a suicide bomber decides to barricade themselves in the bathroom? What are we gonna do about that? I guess we'd have to send in a remote camera. We have those? We can get them. Yeah. Do it. I'll let you know if there's anything else I need. [door opens] [door closes] [protesters clamoring] [Hannity] These people do not believe Saddam Hussein is a threat. Now, they're turning away from the facts. They don't believe that we should do anything about these weapons of mass destruction which everybody knows he has. - There may be more? - I'll show you the classified, uh, documents right here. This is a huge, massive development. It is dangerous to allow an evil dictator to remain in power. [Hannity speaking indistinctly] ...between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda, which some people are saying stretches back 15 years. [Colmes] There's no evidence of that. Nada. Zip. Nothing. [Hannity] So, what are we supposed to do, then? Just wait for the next attack to happen? The terrorists are here, and we're just supposed - to ignore it? - Of course not. [Colmes] But the U.S. must proceed with care and caution. - [Hannity] Care and caution?! - Yes. -You want to wait till Saddam Hussein... -No. ...detonates a nuclear weapon in Times Square - just to prove he's got one? - No. That... If we wait until you liberals get a spine, America will be a pile of rubble ruled by sharia law. - Oh, come on, Sean. - We'll be right back. - Good, good. - And cut. Back in three. So, uh, Alan's starting to sweat. I think we should see him sweat. Yeah? No powder for Alan. [producer] Cut the makeup for Alan. Cut. Great. [chuckles] Shvitzer. I need protection. It's as simple as that. Not from, uh, just terrorists, though the intelligence community have made it quite clear to me I am a target. And if I go down, well, you know, it all goes down. Yes, sir. - You carry? - Yes, sir. Give me a look. Oh, that's very light these days, - yeah? - Yeah, very light. Bernie Kerik tells me you're a good man. A man who can be trusted. That true, Jimmy? I've never known the commissioner to lie, sir. [laughs] You know... [clears throat] a man in my position, a very private man with a very public job, I need absolute discretion, absolute loyalty.

[Beth] I love it. [Roger] Oh, that's good, 'cause I bought it. - [Beth] You bought it? - I bought it. - [Beth] Roger, you did not. - Uh-uh. You know what that is? That's West Point. You ever have any problem, the entire cadet corps can be here, one, two minutes, max. Thank you, Roger. Hey. You have no idea how much this means to me. Thank you. Thank you. [newscasters speaking indistinctly over TV] [phone ringing] [Brian panting] - [Brian] What? - [Moody] We got to talk. [Moody] Uh, Geraldo fucked up. Okay. Fuck. All right. I'm on my way. [Geraldo] Uh, that area where the friendly fire hit, and, uh, it was, uh, y-you know, it was just breathtaking. It's just so awful, the-the whole area kind of vaporized, little tatters of uniform everywhere. It was the saddest place I've ever been in my life. I-I... - This is a fucking disaster. - It's not that bad. It is that bad. Tora Bora's 300 miles away from where that happened. Baltimore Sun's got it. Everyone's gonna run with it. [Brian] We have to issue an apology. We have... No, no, no. What, no apology. Roger, he lied. [Moody] Worse than that, he got caught. It's journalistic malpractice. We don't apologize. If you need to get out in front of it, Brian, get on the offensive. Just say it's the fog of war. An honest mistake. [chuckles] "Honest." Hey, Geraldo came here from CNBC because he wanted to cover the war. Because he is a patriot. Because he's loyal. Anybody in this room ever been shot at? Hmm? Anybody in this room ever covered a war on the ground? Fine. Honest mistake, then? Yeah. He's our guy. Go with that. Anything else? [Moody] Uh, we need to talk about the Iraq WMD coverage. - [Roger] What about it? - Well, we are way out in front on this, and it's totally unsubstantiated. So? - So we need to pull back. - Pull back? What are you, a fucking cheerleader on a first date? - [soft laughter] - Come on, Roger... We got half the goddamn country tuning in to see if Saddam blows up the world tomorrow. It's a great fucking story. "Pull back." - Fuck you. Fuck you. - Roger. Roger, they're-- What, are you getting cold feet 'cause the competition is starting to realize "fair and balanced"? Yes, they're shifting to attract our audience, - but that doesn't mean-- - CNN would've shit three babies to run that first. Roger, the details aren't even sketchy. They are nonexistent. All right? There isn't any there there. I see what I'm dealing with. John Moody, fucking philosophy major. John, we're giving the people what they want. Okay? This country needs to heal. We need to see who we're fighting. No more of this faceless enemy bullshit. Current face of evil is that motherfucker. And his name is Saddam Hussein. And when we rub his fucking face in the dirt, America wins. And when America wins, Fox News wins. Hmm? Judy, anchor room. [clears throat] 40 years. It's not a bad run. [Chet] And it almost didn't happen. Right after you started at Douglas, I almost laid you off. You never told me that. Well, we were getting killed in the ratings, and the suits needed heads. You were just a fucking prop boy. But you didn't. I canned a junior producer instead. Poor bastard's wife was expecting. He was a drunk. So said you. [exhales] You got to play it straight now, Roger. You're putting everything at risk. You're a newsman. You want to play politics, go run a campaign. Otherwise, stick to making television. You control the number one cable news network. That's enough. You're right. And I could never have done it without you, my old friend. - No shit. - [both chuckle] Saddam Hussein-- how do we deal with him as Americans? He threatens America by his existence. One of the most dangerous megalomaniacs on the planet. This footage shows you that we have a Hitler in the Middle East. ...threat of Iraq must be confronted. - Joint resolution has passed. - Joint resolution has passed without objection. ...'cause the risks of inaction would be far greater. The day of your liberation is near. What the hell is that? Now it's gonna take us more work to stay here than it took to get here in the first place. We can't get complacent. - Take it down. - Okay. We have a situation. Woodward? I thought he was dead. What are you trying to get me to believe, Karl? That you didn't suck up to this sycophantic scumbag - and leak my memo? - [Rove] Roger, I do not know how Woodward got that information. Oh, you don't? I do. He got it from you! I wrote that memo to you. Only you and 43. Now it's in fucking black and white in Woodward's book. Hey, I understand you're upset, Roger, but there's nothing I can do about it. You can climb out of your shit-stained pajamas and put out a goddamn press release saying Woodward is lying! That's what you can fucking do, Karl! I can't get involved, Roger. I'm a newsman. This is making me look like I'm playing both sides against the middle. You are playing both sides. You fuck me on this, Karl, I will fuck you right back, and I promise you, you will not enjoy it.

This is about the book? You're damn right it's about the book. I mean, come on. Jesus Christ on a roller skate. If he's gonna talk to Woodward, what other ears is he bending? Karl denied that it was him. Oh, come on, you think I give a fuck about what he denies? - Please. - I understand you're upset. You should be, too. You're about to go to war, Dick. All right? And the rest of the country outside New York City, they don't know how they feel about that just yet. Fox News, we can tip that either way. The president and I value your support. We know we can't do this without you. Well, that's very nice to hear, Dick. But why don't you just start acting like that? I'll talk to Rove. You won't have any more problems. [automated voice] Please deposit 50 cents. I don't think that's gonna be enough. [Cheney] I'm listening. We want full access. No more bullshit from your press shop. If I ask for someone, I want that someone. - Whoever it is. - Fine. I want Rumsfeld one-on-one with Brit Hume. - Done. - Thank you. One more thing. Look, you know, no more Rove.
