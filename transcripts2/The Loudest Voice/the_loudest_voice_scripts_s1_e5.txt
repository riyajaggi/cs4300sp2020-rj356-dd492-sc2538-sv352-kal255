 ♪ up-tempo, dramatic music ♪ [static] [indistinct chatter] [knock on door] Oh. Hey, Roger. I was just, uh, getting ready to come see you. Yeah, well, I thought I'd come and see you first. What did you want to talk about? Well, uh... I was thinking I'd like to branch out a little. You know, polish the brand.

 I feel like I could do better. What does that mean? -Well, I-I don't mean better... -You know, Fox & Friends is the golden ring of breakfast television. You should be very, very grateful you got a hand on that coattail. Oh, I am. You see, it's just, um... [chuckles] The View called me. -Hmm. -Asked if I'd like -to guest host, so... -Hmm. [inhales deeply] Let's not be naive about this. That's how they audition for new people, right?

 Well, I-I don't want another job, Roger, just a chance to build my profile. Are you happy here, Gretchen? Yeah. Of course I am. Sure. Do The View. -All right? -Okay. -That make you happy? -Mm. Great. At the very least, you know, we'll learn something. You know, it could well be you fit in better over there. I have a lot of people saying to me all the time, they say, "Gretchen, she's not really a Fox girl. She's a little too smarty pants, and you know." I mean, I've always believed in you. Always. But they might be right. I don't know. Well, I could try harder to connect. Your voice. I can help you with that. You know, help you keep it in a more attractive tonal range. Yeah. You know I was a Broadway producer, right? Hot L Baltimore. That was my show. It was a big deal at the time. It was a big success. I learned a lot about breath control. And I have helped actors and political candidates harness that power, you know? Hey. Come on, let's you and me talk breathing techniques. -[laughs] Oh, come on, Roger. -Get up. Come on. -I know-- I know how to breathe. -This is gonna be great. That's what they all say till they meet an expert. -[Gretchen inhales deeply] -Yeah. Okay. Now... Oh... Just breathe into my hands. -Come on. -Roger... Right where my hands are. Just breathe into my hands. -Uh... [sighs] -Come on, I want to feel it. Breathe. -And again. -[inhales] Uh-huh. -Breathe into my hands. -[inhales] Now what we have to work on is rhythm, relaxation and control. -Breathe into my hands. -Roger, I... -Breathe into my hands. -[inhales] You know, in television, the audience, they want you to be their friend, their mother and their lover, all at the same time. You've got to give all of that. You know, I think we should spend more time together, you and me. You need some one-on-one mentoring, maybe over a bottle of wine. You know, I know how busy you are. -I wouldn't want to take up your time. -No, no, no. Come on, it's no trouble. Anything for my people. Judy'll make the arrangements. Yeah. [sighs] [door opens] [whispers] Motherfucker. [Brian] Yeah, that situation is no longer a situation. Yeah, I blew a Scud up his ass. [laughing] [knock on door] Oh, hang on. So, Gabe, what can I do for you? [static] I'm doing a book about Fox News. A book? Isn't that something. I'd really love the opportunity to interview Roger. I'll call you back. Gabe, I know your work. We both know you're not exactly a fan of what we do here. I want this to be well rounded. The rise of Fox, from fighting underdog to cable behemoth. Tell it from all sides, all perspectives. Hence Roger-- it's not Fox's story without Roger's story. You know how many people want to write about Roger and Fox? Look, I'm not a hack, Brian. I'm gonna do a real book, and a real book is good for both of us. [scoffs] Gabe, we both know there is no book without Roger. Absolutely. That's why I'm here. There would have to be ground rules. Of course. Understood. But you can't vet it. I write what I write. All right, let me talk to Roger, see what I can do. I'd really appreciate that. -Well, you should. -[both laugh] Thank you. All right. [clears throat] [Brian] So I'm talking to Gabe Sherman over at New York Magazine. He wants to write a book about Fox. Well, I think we should control the story. I think you should sit down with him, off the record, charm him, push the narrative we want. I'd rather go down on a five-dollar whore. Roger, we have to get ahead of these kinds of things. This is... I don't want anybody poking around. Period. You talk to Gretchen lately? [scoffs] Not if I don't have to. She's gonna guest host The View. -I didn't know that. -Exactly. I think she's getting too big for her britches. She doesn't appreciate what I've given her. You want me to call over there? Work some magic? Already did that. Called the EP. I said just make sure he allows extra time for makeup, use the calmest wardrobe person you have, expect lateness, and don't make things too complicated -because she doesn't respond well to that. -Perfect. Put a little stink on that pretty face. [laughs] Sure. [Laurie] Roger was thrilling. From the moment that I introduced myself to him on the Bush campaign in '88, he... he listened to me, gave me advice. He got me a job at Fox. Booking. It was exciting. I was at the center of everything. It was a great opportunity for me. Well, sounds like he was your mentor. That's what I wanted him to be. You know, I-I shouldn't be talking about any of this. None of it. That's what therapy is for. To talk about it. That would... [sighs] That would make Roger very, very angry. -Roger's not here. -You don't know that. You do not know that. What about this, write it down. Like a, like a letter to Roger. All the things you feel you can't say out loud, just write it down. The point is to bring all that darkness out into the light. Can you do that? [footsteps approaching] [door opens] [door closes] [footsteps approaching] [refrigerator opens] -Where's your bread? -Top left. -Top left. -Oh, yeah. Okay. Whew. You know, Beth says I should only eat at mealtimes, but a man's got to eat when a man's hungry. I like that, uh, editorial you did on Romney. -Liked it a lot. -Thanks. But I think it's time to back off, you know? He's our guy now. Our guy? You hate Romney. You called him a blow-dried Mormon cult leader. Well... he is. [chuckles] He is. He's our only chance of getting that Muslim out of the White House, so let's not make perfection the enemy of the good, Joe. Oh, come on, eat. -Come on. -You know... -You want me to cut it? Okay. -No. You know, I-I've been working 24/7. I was thinking about taking some time off, going to see my sister. That's a great idea. Yeah. Family is the most important thing. You know. The absolute foundation of our society. -Mm. -Mm. Why don't you invite her to come stay here? Beth and I would love to meet her. It's a much better idea. Thank you for that. Good night. Good night. [door opens] [door closes] [phone ringing] Hello? [ringing continues] Hello? [Beth] Let them quit. We don't need them if they can't support what we're doing. We will hire new staff. Sure. [chuckles] I guess so, right? [Beth] People will betray you, Joe. They will work against you. They will fight to keep a status quo. Roger and I are prepared for that fight. We have to be. You can't let moments like this bring you down. And you must always truly prepare for the worst. Come with me. I have something I want to show you. Come on. [quietly] This way. You see? We're prepared for whatever happens. Natural disaster, political turmoil, terrorism. We need to be protected, we need to be safe. So you're just gonna hide out here and wait? Of course not. There's a tunnel that leads straight to the Hudson. Quick getaway. Roger... has enemies, Joe. People hate him. Al-Qaeda targeted him for assassination, did you know that? Our CIA source told him. Well... sure there are people who don't like Roger and what he does, but isn't this a bit much? I mean, they're not gonna come at the house with fire and pitchforks. They're out to get us, Joe. You see that. Um, liberals, welfare cheats, jihadists, they want what we have, and one day they're gonna try and take it. And, until then, we need your help to reclaim this country for the real Americans. Don't you want that, too? Of-of course. Roger believes in you. And so do I. And when he's gone... ...you're gonna have some awfully big shoes to fill, Joe. ♪ dramatic music ♪ ♪♪♪ Kids are out. [static] It's just you and me. Oh, you got to stop watching that. I know how much you wanted it. Yeah. My agent talked to every outlet in town, and nothing. Gretchen, you can't go there. Roger made me toxic. Poisoned the well. Babe, you got to let it go. You're on the highest rated morning show on cable. You make great money. You are a success. At Fox, and only at Fox. -Honey... -You're a success right here. -I'm gonna head back up. -Okay. [Kat] Are you sure there's nothing -I can do to help? -[Beth] That's sweet of you, but we're almost ready. Young lady, why don't you tell us a story about when Joe was a young man. Oh, something we don't know. I don't think there's... Shh. Um... Oh! In high school, Joe broke the state record in the mile, -close to four minutes. -[Roger chuckles] -I was a runner, too. -Joe, that's amazing. -Well, not really. -[Roger] Joe. Don't denigrate yourself. Celebrate your accomplishments. Be proud. You won, that's the important thing. [Joe] Honestly, I wasn't the best runner. I could just tolerate more pain. [laughter] Join the club, son. Join the club. [chuckles] -[Kat whispering] -[Joe] Okay... [Beth] Bless us, O Lord, and these, Thy gifts which we are about to receive through Christ, our Lord. -Amen. -[others] Amen. Let's eat. [chuckles] Joe, did you see the polls? Two weeks out and Romney is ahead by a point. Yeah. -Good news. -[Roger] Good? It's great. Four more years of this anti-American socialist, unthinkable. We'll just have to wait and see. [chuckling] No, no, Kat, that's not what we do, we don't wait and see. Every single day is a battle between good and evil. [Kat] I can't say that Obama is evil. He's a good family man, loves his wife, his daughters. Well, he may well love his family, but he sure don't love this country. He's not even from this country. He was born in Hawaii. Joe, I thought you told me your sister was smart. [laughter] [Joe] Roger, she's on our side. Yeah? Could've fooled me. You could've fooled me. You know, this is exactly the problem in this country, the so-called conservatives have no idea the danger the country is in. It's just ignorant. Plain ignorant. Uh, Mr. Ailes, I... It's okay, you don't have to apologize. It's fine. I wasn't going to. You know, I'm surprised that you can sit here at my table and propound these kind of views. Did you vote for Obama? Did you fall for the sob story? The poor, white mommy and the missing black daddy? Welfare hustlers, all of them. You know there's gonna be a revolution. Armed IRS goons kicking down doors. Tell her, Joe. It's-it's a dangerous time. [Roger] You have any idea what four more years of this Kenyan means? A socialist police state. It's gonna be a disaster, but you're okay with it because he loves his wife. You know, Hitler, he loved Eva Braun. Didn't do much for the Jews, did it now? Am I right, Joe? Yes, Roger, -you're right. -Goddamn right I'm right. You think about it, young lady. You're either part of the solution, or you're part of the problem. Hear, hear. [Joe] You don't have to leave. You've got to be kidding me. After that? [Joe] Just used to being the boss, -being listened to. -I was talking about you. You live with him, you agree with everything he says, you even look like him now. It's like you're in a cult. [engine starts] [Roger] I'm sorry about that, Joe. When family disappoints, I know it's hard. Sometimes you just got to cut the apron strings. I think I'm gonna turn in. Good night, son. ...that loyal Americans must vote. You either respect America or you don't. [newsman] When they see President Obama vulnerable with national polls showing him below 50%... [newsman 2] Pennsylvania is now in play for the Republicans. [newsman 3] It's all about the economy. Pushing his vision of lower taxes and cutting spending. The math doesn't work, but he continues to claim that he's gonna do it. He then wants to spend another $2 trillion dollars... [static] And we're on in five, four... Welcome back to Fox & Friends. Let's talk a little about President Obama's campaign slogan, "Hope and Change." We decided to take a look back at the president's first term to see if it lived up to "Hope and Change." [Obama] When you decide it's time for change to happen, guess what? Change happens. Roger would like to see you after the show. Jobs must be our number one focus. [reporter 1] Instead of concentrating on job creation, President Obama is concentrated on growing government. [reporter 2] We are becoming a society that makes poverty more comfortable. We can't just drill our way to lower gas. The price of gas is going up. That's the change we seek. Instant pushback, White House and all the networks are calling it -Republican propaganda. -Surprise, surprise. [chuckles] Brian's drafting a release: upper management didn't know. Blames it on a rogue, low-level producer -who didn't clear it with us. -Good. You know what matters? It aired. -[knock on door] -Yeah? Roger, I have Gretchen. [Roger] Thank you, Suzanne. Gretchen, come in. Come in, sit down. Bill Shine, you're a patriot. -You're not wrong. -[laughs] Sit down, come on. I watched you on The View. [door closes] You looked right at home with those ladies. [chuckles softly] And it got me thinking, you know, maybe you're right. Maybe you're ready for your own show. You're right. I've been ready. You are gonna shine at two o'clock in the afternoon. -An afternoon show? -Mm-hmm. Now, some would say it's a graveyard shift, but you can work your magic, and everyone who has ever become big in their own right, here at Fox, they all proved their value in the afternoon. A little "thank you" is always nice. -[laughs] -Thank you, Roger. Now, we've got a lot to do to get you ready. Your, uh, audience connection still needs work. You got to find a way of giving them more of you. But this is an opportunity to build your own thing, very different from having Doocy and Kilmeade on the couch there to temper you. But I tell you what, nobody's gonna tune in to watch an ice queen all alone. You happy? It's what you wanted, right? -Yeah. -Your own thing. -Are you happy? -Yeah. Are you happy, little Gretchen? -Yeah, Roger. -That's nice, that's nice. Congratulations. Mm-hmm. [door opens] [door closes] [static] We're closing in on the first results in the battle for the White House. It is gonna be an exciting night and how close it will be. [reporter 1] Ohio and Wisconsin, President Obama leading in those states... [reporter 2] The Obama team have built a real machine to try to get out their vote. [Obama] We feel confident. We've got the votes to win. And I expect that, uh, we'll have a good night. How do you think it got this tight? Demographics are changing. It's not a traditional America anymore. The white establishment is now the minority. ♪ somber music ♪ ♪♪♪ [Joe] Um, Roger, hi. I know you're getting ready for the election party, so I just wanted to say... I'm not sure what I'm doing here.

Donald's noncommittal? He doesn't like to lose. [static] [Roger] Come on. Who's out there? Rubio? Bush three? If he commits, and you put the right team around him, he can win the nomination.

Abusive father, overbearing mother and hemophiliac who spent his childhood in and out of hospitals? -That-That's a story. -I'm just telling you, you keep digging down this rabbit hole, and things are not gonna go well for you. Is that a threat? [Brian] All I'm saying is, if you keep talking to unreliable sources, if you keep writing biased stories, it's only gonna get messier for you, I promise. -Yeah? -You go after Roger, and there's gonna be hell to pay. I'm not going after anyone, I'm reporting. Bullshit. You have an anti-Fox, anti-Roger agenda, and you know it. No, the truth is my only agenda. You're reporting on his demeanor in meetings, you're reporting on his temper. I'm reporting what I'm hearing from credible witnesses to Ailes's abusive behavior. These-these are two-faced insiders with an axe to grind, okay? You're not gonna get the truth from disgruntled employees. Why don't you tell me who you're talking to? All right?
