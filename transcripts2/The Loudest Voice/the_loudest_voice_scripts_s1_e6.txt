 Leaking urine? - Um... - Just the littlest bit. Difficulty urinating in general? - No. - Any erection problems? [chuckles] No. It's normal. There are many treatments available... The equipment's fine, Doc. The equipment's fine. Okay, Roger. But he's cancer-free? For now. Regular blood tests to track any reoccurrence are essential. As for the day-to-day, you're getting your strength back,

 but you need to stay active. Some daily exercise. A short walk. And you still need to improve your eating habits. Doc, you're making it sound like death was the better option. [both laughing] - I'll be fine... - It's not funny. [woman on TV] Okay, here we go. We'll see. - Here comes a big wave. - [man laughing] - [man] There you go. - Oh, there's my... The dead flowers go into the garage garbage, - Mercedes. - Yes, Mrs. Ailes. The smell is awful. [indistinct chatter on TV] Elizabeth is so much better than Gretchen ever was. She's a lot easier on the eye, that's for sure. - What time are you going in? - Oh, I don't think so. - The doctor said that you need-- - Oh, that doctor, for God sake. The guy that wants me to eat cardboard and live like shit; what's the point? Roger, you are the captain, and the ship cannot sail without you. - Okay. - Let's get you dressed. You know what? Stop. Just, uh, grab me my cane, please. [woman] Are you gonna try, Maria? [indistinct chatter on TV continues] I'll get Jimmy to put the chair into the car. No, no. I don't think anybody should see the captain in a wheelchair. Oh, come on, just push a little. [grunts] - Lachlan. - How are you, Roger? I didn't know you were heading back stateside. I'm here for the board meeting. Getting back up to speed after being away so long. Lachlan, so nice to see you again. - My wife Beth, of course. - Of course. Pleasure. After you, mate. [newswoman] Good morning, everyone. With a crowded field of potential Republican presidential candidates... [newsman] ...it's still very early, and this contest is wide open. ...leading national polls, Jeb Bush faces challenges... ...Florida senator Marco Rubio hit the so-called invisible... ...seven present or former governors, five sitting or former senators, two business leaders, a renowned surgeon, and a former U.N. ambassador. [newswoman] And for the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, Tom Suarez, Vice President Joe Biden, Senator Elizabeth Warren... Bernie Sanders... We're still 20 months out, and a lot can happen to a candidate over the course of 20 months... Beth. Give me a Danish. You had lunch already, Roger. Come on, just give me a goddamn Danish. Please. One. [newswoman] ...I think this is sort of a normal vetting that's happening. [newsman] Kevin, to you, is it... Why did she put 'em in here, anyway? But they're cut in half, so one is... - Have half. Half. - Two is one. [newsman] Thank you, Kevin, thank you, Marge... - And you know why. - [sighs] - [Gretchen] Sometimes people - Oh, Gretchen. - look at public figures... - Oh, here we go. ...and think they haven't had to struggle, that everything's always come easy. - [mouth full] Because it has. - In my new book, Getting Real, I get very real about the failures in my life, from struggling as a fat kid, - Oh, boo-hoo. - ...living with the guilt of giving up the violin... - Oh, please. - [knock on door] ...to getting fired - a week after getting married. - Yeah? The editorial meeting's about to start. Right. Hey, uh, call Gretchen. Tell her I want to see her. - And what about the meeting? - I'm doing the fucking meeting. Just make her wait. [groans] Thank you, Judy, I've got him. - [grunts, groans] - Come on. I'm fine. Come on, come on. And if she complains about waiting, tell her to take the opportunity to practice the violin. [Moody] We couldn't get anything else out of Michael Cohen, just that Trump has formed the exploratory committee. Roger. I didn't know you'd be here today. Well, I've got to keep everyone - on their toes, now, don't I? - [laughs] Come on, why don't you, uh... No, no, no, I'd-- This is fine. Go on. Well, Cohen insists that Trump is serious about the run, but who knows. Mm, he does this every election cycle. [Roger] Cohen doesn't say boo to a goose without Trump's say-so, so... Well, since he hasn't officially announced... Is he really going to? What people on the coast don't seem to realize is that between the Hudson River and the Sierra Madre, real people love Donald Trump. They love him. And when he runs, he will make an impression, and our ratings... [whoops] Through the roof. And that's all that matters. [chuckles] More than the country? I don't run the country. I just run this little old news network. [phones chiming] [Roger] What? Kim Jong Un decide to push the button or something? It's a... an alert about a new corporate structure at News Corp. Right. Right. All right, well, this was good. I'll see you all soon, yep. Good to have you back. Uh, all right, guys... Not yet. "Lachlan Murdoch will become executive co-chairman of 21st Century Fox, and James Murdoch the new CEO." And I'm learning about this from the Internet? We saw Lachlan this morning. He looked me in the eye, didn't say a word. "The new structure means Fox News chairman Roger Ailes will now report to James and Lachlan Murdoch." Like fuck he will. Fucking Rupert, the coward. No call, nothing. You know what? Fuck these guys, fuck 'em. Mark. I need you to add something in after the next commercial break. Well, I'll wait while you get a fucking pen. It's been misreported by other news outlets that Fox News chairman Roger Ailes will report to James Murdoch. In fact, Roger Ailes will continue to report directly to Rupert Murdoch, just as he has for... - The last 19 years. - [Beth] Bravo. Well, let's see how Rupert deals with that. - [Beth chuckles] - What about some coffee? - Judy? - No, no. You make it best. [door opens] [door closes] Gretchen. Yeah. Send her in. Roger's ready for you now. - [Gretchen] Hey, Roger. - [door closes] Sit. Stop pushing your book on air. Bill pushes his books on every show. You are not Bill O'Reilly. You're not even close. Hell, you're not even Dana Perino. Her book went to number one on the New York Times Best Seller List. First week. You didn't even crack the top 20. - You got me there, Roger. - Getting real? I'll give you some real. You come across as fake. As stiff. Always performing, never natural, never yourself. And that is in real life. On camera, a teleprompter with a fucking wig would connect better with the audience than you do. You keep saying you've had a hard time. I mean, please, please, come on. I don't buy it, your audience doesn't buy it. Your looks got you the world, and you should thank your lucky stars, because there's not a lot of women of your age still on TV. [chuckles] Okay. So, uh... no more pushing my book on air. I got it. Yeah. - Is there anything else? - Yeah. Go to the gym. You're getting bat wings. [exhales] [exhales] [Beth] What's up with Gretchen? She didn't even say hello. [Roger sighs] Fucking menopause. I don't know. Hey. Everything's fine. Any chance you can meet me? In an hour? Okay, great. [Casey] Hey. Why the sudden plan, hmm? Good news about your book? What's up, Gretch? Well, you know how bad things have been with Roger. I thought you said things were better. No. That wasn't honest. It's worse. The bullying, humiliation, constant belittling me, and... ...he's been sexually harassing me for a while. Like... what? Long hugs, cheek kisses turned mouth kisses, grabbing my ass. Okay. I was thinking it was gonna be even worse. What? That isn't enough? When your boss is trying to stick his tongue down your throat? See, this is why I never told you because how it sounds is nothing like how it feels. Okay, you're right. I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry. Forget I said that. I'm sure it was awful. It was. It is fucking awful. Just give us a minute. So why haven't you quit? Because I'm not gonna let that fucking asshole get away with it. I needed proof of what he did, something more than he said, she said. You have proof? [exhales] I've been taping him. What? For over a year. A year? And this is the first I've heard about it? Well, I didn't know what I was gonna do with them, but now I do. Okay...? I'm gonna sue Fox News. - You're gonna sue Fox News? - Yeah. They have the most brutal lawyers in the business. - I know. - It'll be a media spectacle. - Probably. - My clients are the ones that are supposed to be in the spotlight, not me. It wouldn't be you, it'd be me. Oh, come on, Gretchen, you know better than that. Of course the press will drag me into it. You know they'll mention I repped Jeter and whoever else - they think will help... - What do you want me to do? Just drop it? I wouldn't want to upset Jeter. Look, I'm so sorry. Okay? - Jesus. - [sighs] Look, look, these tapes... a-are they even legal? I checked. In New York State, it's one-party consent. And you really want to do it? Yes. [knocking on door] Rupert's office, on one. [door closes] [Roger] Hello? Fine. I can do that. Rupert and the boys would like a meeting, so I have to go downstairs. [grunts] [chuckles] No, no. I'm fine. Stop. [grunts] See? [Murdoch] So the upshot is I'm stepping away from the day-to-day for a bit. I've got a beautiful new yacht, beautiful new girlfriend, so I want some time with them. - Why wouldn't you? - The problem is Wall Street is less understanding. They need a clean line of succession for everyone to relax. Well, I'm not gonna be reporting to your sons. - I'd rather quit. - Quit. [static] Please. [Murdoch] Publicly, for the stability of the company, which I know we all care about, I need people to think that you report to James and Lachlan, but in reality, you can continue to report directly to me. Nothing will change, okay, Roger? But I am the CEO, Roger, and I need you to respect that. I will have directives. In fact, here's one, no getting behind any one candidate during the primaries. Equal coverage for all of them. Got it? [Murdoch] Well, thank you for accommodating my travel schedule. I knew you'd understand, mate. Fucking directives. Roger Ailes. Hello, Donald. Yeah, Roger Stone sent me the plan for the announcements, and, yeah, I got a few comments. You know, the escalator entrance is a great idea, it's great, but you got to have that atrium full. It's got to be packed. Well, you know you can hire people. Yeah, you just get some out of work actors to fill in the background. [chuckles] It does cost money. Yes, it does, but that first shot has got to be powerful. Now, you're Donald fucking Trump, you're a TV star, and this announcement is like a TV show. That's the way you have to think of it. [dog barking in distance] [Nancy] We're small and scrappy... [static] ...but we do this type of case better than anyone. That's why I'm here. Yeah, the problem is your contract. It's restrictive. You waived the right to sue Fox when you signed it. How is that even legal? Almost all corporations do it. [static] That way complaints can be automatically moved into forced arbitration. They can settle and require ironclad NDAs. [Nancy] All the dirty details stay secret. They don't have to admit any guilt. Okay, so what are the next steps? Well, sadly, you can't sue him just because he's an asshole. [chuckles] We need to prove his-his harassment meets the legal criteria for either hostile work environment or as sexual harassment. I'll need all e-mails and text exchanges you had with him. I've got tapes. Tapes of him harassing me. How much tape? Over 20 hours. Is there a specific offer for career advancement - in exchange for sex? - I-I-I think so. I know it's hard, but a quid pro quo makes all the difference in proving sexual harassment. I just want to be clear. I'm not trying to bring down Fox News. I just want Roger's harassment to stop, so I can do my job. I love my job. I'm a journalist. It's... who I am. Thank you, Nancy. You should know, in cases like these, there are usually other victims. Based on the culture at Fox I can see from my own TV, Roger isn't the only harasser. Yeah, but this isn't about Fox. Fox isn't gonna get rid of Roger. They're gonna pay you to be quiet - and go away. - Yeah. I get it. It's hard. Take your time. Listen to the tapes. See what you come up with, then let's talk. [Beth] Why won't you let me wheel you in? Because I'm better and I just don't need that fucking wheelchair anymore. Roger, for the days where you aren't feeling 100%... Take it back, okay? I never want to see it again. - But you're not actually... - Beth. Get rid of the motherfucking chair. Hmm? I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I just... I'm better. And you can return the chair now, please. Of course. [newsman] Add real estate mogul and Celebrity Apprentice host Donald Trump among a growing list of potential 2016 Republican candidates. Is Donald Trump making a run? [newswoman] ...businessman and TV personality has hinted several times... [Trump] ...very serious. I've been very serious. I see what's going on with the country. A lot of people would say it's going to hell. [newsman] Trump is the political equivalent of a shark attack. [newsman 2] He's great at being noisy. He's sort of a very noisy clown. But he's something that people will watch. [newsman 3] Trump is going to be a big personality if he does get into the race. [Shine] Oh, he does know how to make an entrance, doesn't he? Twelve years of television's gonna serve this guy well. [newsman 4] And Donald Trump is about to make an announcement. What it is, we don't know. That is some group of people, thousands. - [audience cheers] - So nice, thank you very much. It's great to be at Trump Tower, it's great to be in a wonderful city, New York, and it's an honor to have everybody here. This is beyond anybody's expectations. There's been no crowd like this. He needs more air cover here. You think he has a chance? He's a better communicator than Reagan. - He's already twice as famous. - They're laughing at us, at our stupidity. I would say anyone who underestimates him is a fool who doesn't understand the average American, - not like we do. - But they're killing us economically. - No, I see it. - [Trump] The U.S. has become a dumping ground - for everybody else's problems. - [Roger] Our people love him. And the rest love to hate him. But you know what, Bill? Everybody's watching. When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. - Hannity loves him, right? - Oh, yeah. They go back a long way? They do. Yeah. [Roger] Tell Sean he's gonna be Trump's guy. He's gonna be the major voice of support. - Sean'll be thrilled. - They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're rapists, - and some... - [Roger laughing] ...I assume are good people. - Did he just say that? - Yeah. He's just giving the people what they want, Bill. He's gonna make a mark. [Trump] They're sending us - He will. - not the right people. It's coming from more than Mexico. - Bye! - Bye, bye, bye, bye. - Good night, Grandpa. - I love you. - [Neil] I love you, too. - Bye! We love you! - Bye. - Sorry, I hope I'm not early. - Oh, come in. - No, you're great. - You're perfect. - [chuckles] - Bye. - Drive safely. - Bye, sweetheart. - Our family dinner ran over. [Gretchen laughs] [Hannity] ...Star Wars. And Reagan said "nyet" and he walked away from the table, and eventually, it led to peace. And that's just like Trump's Art of the Deal. Reagan to Trump. Nice. [Nancy] Love you. - Roger, it's late. - Yeah, I'm just watching Hannity. - You need to relax. - I am relaxing. - I'm watching Hannity. - [Hannity] ...you walk away. I'm not wearing those fucking things. - The doctor said... - The doctor... he says a fuckload of things, Beth. A fuckload. All right? Doesn't mean he's the voice of God. - He's a good doctor. - ...it becomes a bad deal, - Hey, come on. - I'm willing to walk away. You've had plenty. And that's Trump. The strength and leadership this country needs. - It is, right? - He's not wrong. [Nancy] We have some news. We found a loophole. Now, you can't sue Fox, but you can sue Roger Ailes personally in New Jersey. - In New Jersey? - The New Jersey courts are friendlier to plaintiffs in these cases. But Roger doesn't live in New Jersey. He moved to Garrison years ago. Yeah, but he still owns a house in New Jersey, which technically makes him a resident. It's a bold move. There's a risk they could throw out the suit, but I think the odds are good. Okay... It's just... suing Roger personally. That's a lot. We only pursued this because a public fight - is what you said you wanted. - I know. I did. But after really thinking about settling... [exhales] It's my family. I just-- I don't want to drag them through this. It's a media fucking spectacle. Well, what do you want from this, Gretchen? Specifically? Validation. Of what happened to me. And a public apology. Well, we could still pursue a settlement if you'd rather. But I wouldn't encourage you to go down this trial road unless I thought the odds were in your favor. And this is the only way this goes public. This is the only way that people know what Roger Ailes did to you. [Nancy] Did you find the quid pro quo in the tapes yet? [Gretchen] Not yet. [Nancy] Keep listening. We need all the ammunition we can get. [Roger] It's my news network, Gretchen. Rupert pays the bills, but what I say goes. Megyn plays the game. She's funny, she's loose, she knows how to take a joke, how to take a compliment. You could learn a lot from her. [Gretchen] I do my job well. I have nearly 20 years' experience in broadcasting. That counts for something. [Roger] People don't watch Megyn because of her experience, because of her journalism. She's a star. She's a natural. And Fox viewers can eye-fuck her with their wives sitting right next to them. She's family-friendly porn. And you? Ah, come on. You're not worth a fraction of what Megyn Kelly is. Now, that's a tough call, but that's real. [static] [newsman] ...first major debate. In the center of the stage tonight, businessman Donald Trump. Mr. Trump, one of the things people love about you is you speak your mind, and you don't use a politician's filter. However, that is not without its downsides-- in particular, when it comes to women. Should've been you, babe. You've called women you don't like fat pigs, dogs, slobs, and disgusting animals. - Your Twitter account... - Only Rosie O'Donnell. - [laughter] - [mutes sound] - He's such a pig. - Yup. [newsman] Safe to say it was the Donald Trump show tonight, for better or for worse. [newsman 2] A shouting match that at times bordered on - bedlam. - Their leaders are stupid. He's trying to con people into giving him their vote... The real con artist is Senator Marco Rubio... [Ted Cruz] That's a matter of principle... You are the single biggest liar... You probably are worse than Jeb Bush. [Jeb Bush] You're never going to be President of the United States by insulting your way - to the presidency. - Well, let's see, I'm at 42 - and you're at three, so... - Doesn't matter. [Trump] What I say is what I say. And honestly, Megyn, if you don't like it, - I'm sorry. - [Megyn] When did you actually become a Republican? [crowd cheers] [Trump] She hits out, and she starts asking me all sorts of ridiculous questions, and, you know, you could see there was blood coming out of her eyes, uh, blood coming out of her... wherever. But she was, uh, in my opinion, she was... - [mutes sound] - What is Trump doing? [Irena] And tweeting non-stop. In one, he called Megyn a "bimbo." [static] [Shine] Hannity said Trump called him, and he's pledging never to come on Fox again. Well, we're dealing with a fucking egomaniac, all right? I mean, God, if he thinks he can win without us... He'd better get in line - or he's fucked. - Isn't he already fucked? It's only August and Trump's goose might be cooked. [Irena] If he keeps coming after Fox, he'd better be prepared for the consequences, right, Roger? I just don't think this is good for anybody. Bullets for the statement? I want it to come from me personally, not just Fox News. Uh... Donald Trump's attacks on Megyn -are unacceptable... - and disturbing. - [knock on door] Mr. Murdoch is here to see you. [Roger] Okay. [grunts] - I'm all right. - You okay? Okay. Come on. Rupert. [chuckles] Roger... this Trump situation is getting out of hand. - I agree. - He crossed a line with Megyn. We need to back off on his coverage. Yeah, I'm, uh, I'm putting out a statement in support of Megyn, uh, condemning what Trump said. Funny thing, though, you know, because it's all anybody wants to talk about. Yeah, neutral coverage, equal time with the rest of the candidates, like, uh... we've already asked, Roger. They just don't bring the eyeballs that Donald does. Every single thing out of this uptown redneck motherfucker's mouth is ratings gold. - [chuckles] - Enough. No more Trump favoritism. [sighs] Is this coming from you or is this coming from James? It's not a request, Roger. It's a directive. [door closes] [knock on door] - How'd that go? - Great. Ha. Great. You know, there's just a little imbalance going on at the moment. Right now, Rupert hates Donald. But Donald's ratings are lining his pockets. And also right now, Donald hates Rupert. And he also hates Fox News, but he can't win without us, and he knows that, so I've just got to get everything back in-- on track. Get everyone in line, that's all. Oh, fucking James. Little shit. Didn't have the balls to come and see me himself, so he had to send his daddy. Yeah. Look at that. Look at that. Tell me that mouth hasn't sucked a cock. [laughing] Right? [Roger] If there's a physical connection, it gets you through the rough patches, you know? Like when you're getting on each other's nerves. This could've worked, even with all our conflicts. [Gretchen] What are you saying, Roger? [Roger] I'm saying that you and I should have had a sexual relationship a long time ago. Then you'd be good and better, - and I'd be good and better. - Yes! Got him. Fucking got him. [exhales] [grunts] [exhales] Fuck. [grunts] Fuck. [Beth] What is it? Wh... Fuck it. - What's wrong, Roger? - Nothing. Go back to sleep. [sniffs] Oh... [Roger] Prostate cancer. Impotence. [water running] And now incontinence. I'm sorry. Roger, please, it's nothing. It's... It's a lot for you to deal with. I'm s... I'm so sorry. We all age. You don't. Not in my eyes. It's just a bump in the road. People go through this sort of thing all the time, and they get better. I'd always imagined doing things with Zach. Achieving things together. And you will. He's so young. Why don't we go and get some ice cream? That sound good? Yeah. [static] [Trump] The fact is, she asked me a very inappropriate question. She should really be apologizing to me. I certainly will not apologize for doing good journalism. [newsman] Is this the behavior of the leader of the free world? [newswoman] The stage is set for tomorrow's Fox News debate, and Donald Trump, he's not gonna be there. Well, Fox is playing games, yeah. Fox is gonna make a fortune. Is Donald Trump going to show up? I don't know what games Roger Ailes is playing. What-What's wrong over there. Mr. Trump, we'll see you Thursday night, right? And so I'm gonna be making a decision with Fox, but I probably won't bother doing the debate. Well, that press release didn't do squat. You want me to start going after him? There's a rumor about him and that porn star. No, that's not gonna work. Because he's utterly shameless. He's absolutely shameless. You almost gotta admire it. I do admire it. [chuckles] You know what? Just... Keep some time on Fox & Friends and Hannity tomorrow. Keep me posted. All right. We're calling Donald. [clears throat] [Roger] Donald. Roger. No, no, no. I understand. Look, I'm still willing to support you and I'm still willing to get the Fox News audience to support you. You just got to stop biting the hand that feeds. No. Don... [clears throat] I'm gonna tell you something that is a fact and you need to hear it as a fact. Fox News can make or break you. That is a fact. No, I don't give a shit about-- Look, hey, if you don't want to apologize to Megyn or to Fox or me, I don't give a fuck. All right? That's not my agenda. But you bashing Fox News has got to stop now. Yeah. Well, look, the way this works is that you'll get more time than the other candidates, all right? We'll give you softball questions, nothing hard. We'll even feed them to you in advance if you want. And you know what? I can craft a couple of snappy comebacks for you myself. [laughs] Well, I know you don't need any help in the zinger department. The one about Mexican rapists was a knee-slapper. Yeah. [chuckling] Okay. Are we good? We all kissed and made up? Uh-huh? Great. I'll have the booker call your guy, and you can just work out some times. Fox & Friends, Hannity, whatever you want. Tomorrow? Well, look, that will be very difficult because it's a lot to ch-- You know what, for you... I'm gonna clear the schedule. Yeah. Bye. [chuckles] It's back on track. You know, sometimes I'm sad that I'm the only one who gets to witness this. What? You. Running everything. Eh. What else have we got? What's on? [newswoman] Breaking tonight, Trump wins big in South Carolina, and Bush suspends his campaign. This election is over. You watch. [newswoman 2] Donald Trump with a commanding lead... [newsman] The clear path to a Republican nomination... When you win, it's beautiful, and we're gonna - start winning for our country. - [Rachel Maddow] Donald Trump, -projected as the winner. -Today my campaign is suspended. [newswoman 3] It's hard to say where Trump gets stopped now. Donald Trump dominating Super Tuesday - from coast to coast. - We are suspending - our campaign. - [newswoman 4] Donald Trump has reached the magic number to clinch the nomination. We are going to make America great again. [cheering] Yeah, he did it. Yeah. Oh, come on, you said it, too. [newsman] And now Donald Trump prepares for the general election as the Republican nominee. - Roger Stone. - Oh. [Roger] No, congratulations, and, uh, thank you, too. No, she's right here. Oh. Hello, Roger. That would be great. When you get back in town. All right, bye. [newsman] ...who pushed him past the 1,237 needed for the... Republicans don't know what hit 'em. [chuckles] You know, I think Donald is about to prove that television has replaced the political party. Oh, just like you said it would when you elected Nixon. Yeah, back in the bad old days. If he listens to me and Roger Stone and Manafort... we'll get him in the White House. That means you and I get to spend a night in the Lincoln Bedroom. [newsman] Trump, seizing on the State Department's... You really think he can beat Hillary and the Clinton machine? Well, you know what we got to do is just drag out every goddamn skeleton in the Clinton closet. - Hmm. - His and hers. Vince Foster. Whitewater. Paula Jones. Monica. - Ugh. - Benghazi. [both laughing] I mean, we've got some ammunition here. And the e-mails. The e-mails. Yeah. I swear to you, Beth, in your lifetime... there'll never be another Clinton in the Oval Office. [car horns honking] [Dianne] Roger. - Dianne. - Hello. We need to talk about Gretchen's contract. It's almost up. I can't keep putting off her agent. We're not gonna renew. You sure you want her outside the tent? She's no threat. Nobody else wants her; it's time for her to go. So she's done. She's done. [Gretchen] As always, thank you for spending some of your afternoon with me. We'll see you back here tomorrow. We are out! Bill needs to speak with you. Oh, okay. I'll just get my purse. You won't need it. - But I need to get my-- - Now, Gretchen. He needs to see you now. [knocking on door] - Yes. - [door opens] Gretchen, hi. Hey, Bill, what's up? Uh, please. No, I'm good.
