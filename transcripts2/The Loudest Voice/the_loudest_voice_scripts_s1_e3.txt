 Thank you, Minnesota. God bless you. God bless the United States of America. [cheering and applause over TV] ♪ loud, cacophonous music ♪ ♪♪ [Roger] I had my first job at your age. I think it's time you took some responsibility. So every morning, you're gonna hoist the flag, and every evening, you're gonna take it down. Most importantly, respect the flag and never let it touch the ground. ♪ optimistic, dramatic music ♪ ♪♪ [Beth] Hi, boys! Mom. [Beth] Did you know Hello, Dolly! - was filmed here in Garrison? - [Roger] Mm-hmm. Streisand and Matthau took over the whole town. They shot here for a month. Hmm. There's a local historical society. I'm thinking about joining. Good. - Are you even listening? - Dolly. Streisand. Historical. - Hmm. - Jesus Christ. The Democrats have nominated an African socialist who wants to redistribute the country's wealth, and the biggest news around here? - Potlucks and yard sales. - Well, it's a community paper, Roger. - What do you expect? - News in the newspaper. Actual news. Annual invite from Warren, Ohio. The Veterans' Memorial Association - inviting you to speak. - Annual rejection. - What? - We should accept. Go back to Warren, show Zac where you're from. It'd be good for him. You haven't been back in over 20 years. One day. [McCain] ...the old me first, country second Washington crowd: - change is coming. - Fox News/Opinion Dynamics polls are out, and they have Democrat Barack Obama out in front of Republican John McCain by three percentage points. [O'Reilly] I don't have a problem with Barack Obama, by the way... All right, so where are we? In "The Obama Chronicles" segment... O'Reilly added .3 in the demo - last night. Best in weeks. - [Roger] Of course he did. What is Obama's strongest foreign policy? He's got a new book coming out, so he's not just phoning it in. We should be charging the fucker a commission. [laughter] The American people aren't stupid. [indistinct chatter] What does this all mean for November? Was Obama doing everything right, or is McCain doing something wrong? Where are we in the race? Gallup's got McCain down by six, and even Rasmussen has it outside - the margin of error. - Look, I understand that. I like John a lot. He's a goddamn war hero. But his message, it's about as limp as Liberace's handshake. [laughter] Morning. Carry on. [Roger] It's not his only problem. They got George Soros and all of his hard left media buddies. They've decided they're gonna put an affirmative action hire into the White House. Now, we got to be on top of that. Where are we with Obama's Islamic education? [woman] The madrassa? Still nothing confirmed. You got to keep digging. He 100% was raised in a Muslim school. I have that on very, very good authority. Where are we with the Michelle Obama tape? Oh, my guy's still chasing it down. He swears he's heard the audio. Michelle saying, "I hate whitey." [laughs] Come on, that's solid gold. - It really is. - I mean, it won't be sourced. Well, it doesn't matter. You just frame it as a question. "Does a new tape reveal that Michelle Obama hates white people?" - That's one way to do it. - Yeah. Roger, that's... - that's pushing it. - No, it's not pushing it. Barack Obama has managed to trick the entire media, except for us, into getting behind him and his socialist ideas and manifestos. The last two guys who did that? Hitler and Stalin. Okay? That man is a danger to this country, and it is on us to make sure the voters know. All right. Let's just make sure we're at our very best. [clears throat] - All good? - Yeah. Roger, why hasn't O'Reilly's deal closed? I don't know where you're getting that from. His agent responded to the counter and agreed to $45 million dollars - over four years. - Oh, good. I just wanted to make sure we're on track. You know, I'm out of town for a bit, um, but I'll see you at the Fox Business launch. Rupert just asked me about O'Reilly's contract negotiations. That means somebody's pissing outside the tent. Find out who that is. This is off the fucking record. We clear? There's gonna be layoffs. [scoffs] Names. Yeah, I'm gonna give a fucking reporter names? What am I, Santa Claus? Well, but you know what? This just might be your lucky day. Marty Dibari in legal. Check him out. You remember this: I am not your source. All right? You fuck me on this, and I swear to God, I will fuck you back so hard you'll be coughing up my dick. [Roger] Everything ready for the FBN party? [Laurie] I sent the final guest list to your office for sign-off. Venue and vendors all confirmed. Good. There can't be any complications. Nothing short of excellence. Rupert's been riding my ass to launch this business network for two years. I told him there's no room in the market. Nobody in the goddamn world - wants another CNBC. - [phone ringing] Hey, Beth. No, I'm in a meeting. How much? Jesus. Well, it's the Garrison Historical Society. It's not the Smithsonian. Well, if it means that much, we can write a check. Okay, I got to go. I think about her sometimes, Roger. - Don't. - I feel guilty. You know, she loves you. - I just... - Laurie. - Don't you ever think-- - I'm a multifaceted man, and my family is only one part of me. ♪ tense, ambient music ♪ ♪♪ Go and get your uniform.

[Laurie] Roger is... He's brilliant. - Brilliant. - Yeah, yeah, I know, but people say he can be brutal. You know, 20 years ago, Roger Ailes told me that he would change the world. And he did. The man is a genius. People kill to work at Fox. You should remember that. ♪♪ [Zac] Damn it. ♪♪ Brian. Marty. Marty, what am I doing here? I got a party to go to. I just got a call from the Daily News asking me to comment on a story about me being fired. Okay, calm down. Just tell me what the reporter said. Just... that I'm about to be laid off. What am I supposed to tell my wife? She's gonna kill me. Fuck! I can't get fired, not now. I need this job! Look, sometimes reporters get bad information. So I'm not being fired? Well, not yet. But, um... leak again, and you will be. Brian, I didn't leak. I would never. You didn't leak? You didn't go down to Langan's and get drunk? You didn't tell that secretary in corporate you're trying to bang about O'Reilly's stalled contract? - You didn't do that? - She works with us. She works for News Corp, not Fox. Just because Murdoch signs all the paychecks doesn't mean we jerk each other off in the shower. Anyone outside Fox is the enemy. And we do not talk about what we do. I understand. Good. Lighten up there, buddy. It's a nice night. [car door closes] ♪ upbeat, light jazz ♪ ♪♪ [band playing upbeat, light jazz] He has black eyes, which I love. [laughing] Roger, Beth, uh, welcome, welcome. Wendi's just telling us about Diller's fund-raiser for Obama in East Hampton. [static] What a surprise, Beth, we weren't invited. [Wendi] And Michelle. So beautiful. Like Jackie, but black. [laughter] She asked me to lunch next time she's in Manhattan. [Murdoch] Roger, Prince Al-Waleed, our second biggest shareholder. Mr. Al-Waleed. Mr. Ailes, it's a pleasure. His Highness flew in from Riyadh just for tonight. Well, I'm just glad you didn't hit any buildings on the way in. [Beth] [laughing] Oh, Roger. What a sense of humor you have. [Roger] I'll be back in a minute. [indistinct whispering] How many years have you worked for me now? How many years have you known I do not like to walk into a room and get surprised by guests I wasn't expecting to see? They were Wendi's guests. People I've not approved, people I've not invited. This is my party, my room, my guest list. Let me know if there's anything else I need to remind you about, Laurie, 'cause I wouldn't want to see you fail so abysmally again. Just let me know if you need any fucking help. [light jazz playing] [laughter, indistinct chatter] Gretchen. Roger. [static] You know, little Miss America here is gonna be the queen of morning television on Fox & Friends. I had to break a couple legs at CBS to get her, but it was worth it. [laughter] So, McCain's coming on Fox & Friends next week. Doocy's had the last three interviews. I want this one. Gretchen, I'm quite sure you should be speaking to your E.P. I don't do the bookings. I have. And you thought it was okay to just go over her head and talk to me directly? Well, I think we should give you a shot. [laughs] Thank you, Roger. You won't regret it. [laughing] Oh, I better not. [laughs] You know I've fucked two Miss Americas? - Not that one yet. - By the way, you can sleep tonight. I plugged the leak. You should have seen him, too. He was shitting himself. He was like, "Oh, my God, what am I gonna do? My wife is gonna kill me. Why am I such a simpering asshole?" It was beautiful. - Brian fucking Lewis. Well done. - Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. [Beth] I caught Jenna Lee on Happening Now yesterday. I thought she was just phenomenal. Really popped. I agree. I've been telling Roger the same thing. Telling Roger what? Oh, we were just talking Jenna Lee. Beth thinks she's a talent. I agree. I-- Ah, you got to watch this one. She's got a good eye. -Oh. -You see what she's done with the house? Yeah. Impressive. Fantastic. There's Judy. I need you to keep an eye on Laurie Luhn. How close? Siamese twins close. Telephone, e-mail, everything? [song ends] Consider it done. [applause] Thank you all for coming. This is a big night for News Corp. After revolutionizing news, we are now taking a bold step into financial news and information with Fox Business Network. We live in an interconnected world and we need to embrace this openness as true global citizens. [applause] I'd like to thank everyone who made this evening possible. Most importantly, there's one person to whom I owe the success of this evening. My wife Wendi. [applause] [Roger] Sycophants. Ass-lickers, parasites. Outrageous. [Roger] Did you see them? Just lapping up every word that Rupert and his concubine said, like they're some kind of robber baron power couple with the keys to the kingdom. Enjoy the night, and thank you for coming. [Beth] Well, unfortunately, they sort of are, aren't they? You heard what he said, right? - "Global citizens." - Yeah. What does that even mean? What, to just let the immigrants invade? We'll all just stand down and watch while every jihadi gets to decide whether he wants to live in Pittsburgh or Peoria? Scary. That's what it is. I was wrong about Warren. We should go. We should show Zac the real America. Yes, we should. [newsman] With America wondering just what this new presidential candidate needs to say in order to make markets recover, Barack Obama, still ahead in the polls, today blamed Wall Street for the financial crash. With markets in turmoil, some experts wonder if Democratic candidate Barack Obama will issue a call to break up the banks. With unemployment now at six and a half percent, and 240,000 Americans newly unemployed... - [Mark] Control room. - Mark. [newsman] ...was going to say anything decisive... His name is Barack Hussein Obama. Always use his middle name. [Mark] We don't have to worry about pushback? No, it's respectful. It's like... Martin Luther King. Okay, you got it. - Or John Wayne Gacy. - [knocking] Killed it in the overnights. Beat CNN by 300K in the demo. I'm telling you, Obama is great for ratings. Yeah, says you, the Democrat. [newsman] Market fell almost 120 points just on Thursday and Friday alone. - There goes my 401(k). - You wait. See what happens with the markets if he wins. He wants to share the wealth. That old chestnut. Take from the rich, give to the poor. He's a fucking communist. I need us to look into somebody. I'll call Dietl. Who is it? I think she's fucking around on him. [Brian] Okay, look, Rog, let's think fir-- She's pushing him to the left. Bad for business, fucking dangerous. See all his new celebrity friends and his hair dye. She controls everything he eats, everything he drinks. But it's not about his health. Mind control. I agree with Brian. This is an unnecessary risk. I don't care about the risk. I will not have her undermining the work we do here. For all we know, she already works for fucking Obama. Or the Chinese government.

Oh, thank you, Martha. I can't wait to get started. Oh, thank you, Beth. We're excited to have some new blood in the society. And please thank your husband for his generous contribution. Of course. It was our pleasure. [indistinct chatter] [Beth] Excuse me. [receptionist] May I help you? [Beth] I'd like to speak with the editor. He's out. Okay, then the publisher. Our publisher is the editor. We have a lean staff, as you can see. Well, I'd like him to know that his employees are making blatant political statements with their bumper stickers. It's a breach of journalistic integrity, it shows bias, and it's wrong. Ms....? Ailes. Mrs. Roger Ailes. Mrs. Ailes, we don't take political positions at the paper.

[Obama] People suggest that I pal around with terrorists. [McCain] You launched your political campaign - in Mr. Ayers' living room. - That's absolutely not true. [Palin] He was a domestic terrorist. [newsman 3] This is desperate, it's dishonorable... [woman] I can't trust Obama. - He's an Arab. - No, ma'am. [Obama] I think tax policy's a major difference between - Senator McCain and myself. - [McCain] I've got a plan for cutting spending, for keeping taxes low, for, uh, making sure that people can keep... stay in their homes, and a long-term plan. But to show leadership... there's 35 days left till this election, and undoubtedly this entire thing's gonna come down to the economy... so to show leadership, Senator, what will you do? [McCain] I am confident we will have a bill, and it will rescue the American economy. But remember, all it's gonna do is stop the bleeding. We've got a long way to go to get our economy and our prosperity going again, which we can and will. Sounds like a winning message to me. Well, we have to leave it there. Thank you, Senator McCain.

It'll just be a few more minutes. You know how it is in the heat of a campaign. Yeah, I know a bullshit power play when I see one. The donor breakfast ran long. It screwed the entire day. Or maybe you're making me wait as payback for the Paul Simon-Lynn Martin race. It's 30 years ago, man. - Get over it. - You called my guy a weenie at a live press conference. - He was a weenie. - And Martin was hands down the worst candidate I've seen. No wonder you quit politics when she lost. She was batshit crazy. [laughing] Hmm. You know, I have to say, I was surprised about the Biden decision. You know, lovely man, but Joe is as dumb as an ashtray. He-he plays well for us where we need him to. - Uh-huh. - Uh, Catholics, union guys, - military. - With white people.

Then why have I been waiting outside with my dick in my hand - for the last hour? - I just thought it would be productive if we could all get on the same page. - And what page is that? - [Axelrod] Cut the shit, Roger. What you're doing at Fox is dangerous. We're reporting the news. Both sides of the story. You're stirring up racial hysteria. Fanning conspiracy theories. Calling Obama some kind of Muslim - Manchurian candidate. - Don't be so dramatic. If your candidate doesn't like his coverage, tell him he can come on Fox. That's enough, Roger. We need to come to some sort of understanding. I told Barack there'll be no more of this Hussein business. From now on, Fox will cover his campaign fairly and respectfully. He may well be the next president. We better start treating him as one. Okay? ♪♪ Dianne? Tell Brian to get going on the Wendi file.

It is from Alaska that we send those out to make sure that an eye is being kept -on this very powerful nation... -Oh, Jesus. Russia, because they are right there. [groans] This is not an interview, it's an assassination. McCain's team of morons, they've given him an Achilles' heel. Now, she is supposed to make McCain look young and vital.

Yes, it's Hello, Dolly! It's very exciting, of course, but... but Garrison is so... small. Well, you always said you wanted to bring Zac up - in a small town. - That's true. And now that he's in school, I feel like my talents are being wasted. I... I was thinking about asking Roger if he needs any help down here at Fox. Help doing what? Programming, maybe.

Did you hear that? Hear what? I... I don't hear anything. I'll see you tonight. Yeah, the same spot. Outside, right? By the car rental stand. Well, I'll see you tonight, sweetie. Bye. [dog barking] [indistinct chatter] [businessman] Ah, Mr. Ailes, thank you for coming. - My wife Elizabeth. - Pleasure to meet you. - My son Zachary. - Hi. It's their first time in Warren. So, what do you think of our city? Any town that made Roger Ailes is great in my book. - [laughs] - [phone ringing] - Excuse me. - Oh, of course. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Good. Who was that? Rupert blinked. I have full editorial control. I knew it. There is no Fox without you.

How do you know where I'm going? [static] [Suzanne] Roger wants you to review the contributor list. He needs it Monday, first thing. [Shine] Tell your mom. Come home another time. Come on. ♪ pulsing, dramatic music ♪ [cheering and applause] [Roger] My friends, I am a simple man. To the extent I've had any success in my life... it is because I never forgot the values I learned growing up right here in Warren, Ohio. [cheering and applause] When I grew up, Warren was a symbol. A symbol of American strength, American prosperity, and American opportunity. [cheering] My father spent his whole life here. He didn't go to college, but he had a good job at the Packard plant and he lived out his days on his pension. But today those jobs are gone. - That's true. - [man] That's right. The elites have taken them away. - [shouts of assent] - For years, they have shipped your good-paying jobs overseas, while importing foreign immigrants who will work for less. We don't need 'em here. And it's not just Warren. All over the country, towns are being stripped of their wealth and their identities by so-called Americans who are trying to dismantle the greatest country on Earth by erasing the things that made us great: God, country, family, - and manufacturing. - [cheering] The war our fathers fought was won on the beaches of Normandy and in the skies and waters of the South Pacific. The war of our time, for American families and American values, will be fought right here, in small towns across America. In Garrison, New York and Warren, Ohio. - Yes! - And we must band together and stand together and vote together and take our country back, block by block, town by town, city by city. Together, we can win this war. Together, we can make America great again! [cheering and applause] ♪ intense, dramatic music ♪ ♪♪ [cheering and applause continue] ♪♪ ♪♪
