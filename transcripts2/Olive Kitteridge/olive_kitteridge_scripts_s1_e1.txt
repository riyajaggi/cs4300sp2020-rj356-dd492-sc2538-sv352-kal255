 Happy Valentine's Day, Ollie. Yeah. You too, Henry. - Morning, Lois. - It's cold. I'd like to get in. I have places to be today. Could you just let him know that I'm here? He'll be with you in a minute, dear. No need to stand right in front of me. Hey, Rachel. What can I do for you? I need this filled. Okay. Lois? Why don't you go get a cup of coffee? I'll take the register.

 Suit yourself. - Rachel, this isn't your regular doctor. - That's right. Well... Well, I'll have to let him know that we already have a prescription for Valium for you on file. Why would you have to do that? Well, you know I can't double up your dose. I don't feel like coming in here to pick up more pills. That's the whole point. Maybe a couple extra trips into town's just the thing you need. It's good to get out when you're feeling blue. Christ, Henry. Blue is what I feel on the good days. Let me ask you something. How much wattage do you use in your light bulbs?

 I don't know. - Sixty watt? - Yeah, probably. Yeah, not enough in the winter. If you have a gloomy house, you never get out of your funk. You wanna pay my electric bill? I want you to go next door to Harmon's and get a couple of 100-watt bulbs, and use 'em till the days get longer. And then you can switch back to the lower watts. Yeah. You're not gonna fill my prescription, are you? No. Sorry, Rachel. I cannot. You know, I'll just go to a pharmacy in another town. Well, maybe the drive will do you good. Henry, we need you out here. Lois took a spill. Oh, dear God. Excuse me, Rachel. She came in to get a coffee. She seemed just fine. Then she walked out and she just kind of crumbled. Lois? Lois, you hear me? You want me to slap her, Henry? No. She stopped breathing. Call an ambulance. What happened? - Who is that? - It's Lois! - I just saw her walk past. - Oh, my God. I didn't see! I turned around and she was on the ground. She's dead, Henry. She's left the building. Oh, sweet Jesus. Oh, dear God. You should fix that. You know, her panties. Christopher? I've got some very sad news to tell you. What? Mrs. Granger died today. She went to the donut shop to get a cup of coffee, and on the way back, she had a stroke. She was alive this morning. Now, she's gone. She's gone, son. Who's Ms. Granger? Chris, for God's sake, you know who she is. She's been working for me since before you were born. Stop, Henry. You couldn't stand the old bat. Enough. Let's be respectful. - Don't pretend to be sad. - What? She was due to kick, and now you're free. Well, she wasn't a pleasant woman. But all the same, she was once someone's child. And kittens grow into cats. Poor Lois. Let's hope she's at peace. Well, now you can hire someone young and cute who thinks you're a God. Won't that be nice? It will, actually. So, how's school, son? Fine. He's getting a C in English. O'Casey doesn't grade fairly. I always do my work. I'm never late. And he gives me a C? - Well, that doesn't sound quite right. - It isn't, Dad. Your son doesn't understand subtext. Well, I don't really understand subtext either. Oh, God, Henry. Well, I think if Christopher is putting forth his best effort... I read your son's paper. It is lazy, slapdash crap. That's a little harsh, Ollie. You don't know. You're not there. Jim O'Casey understands your son's abilities more than you do. Well... He understands when they're being squandered. You want your kid to grow up to be a dope? Go ahead. We're not finished yet. Would you like me to help you with your homework, son? No. May I be excused? Yeah. Go ahead. Go. Go! Ollie? No, I don't need to talk about it, Henry. I'm done. All right. You threw away my card! I already read it. You don't want to save it? Don't be hurt. You know I don't like clutter. There. It's up now for all to see. Give me a kiss. You look great today. - Do I look okay? - Yeah, you look beautiful. - Morning, Denise. - Morning, Mr. Kitteridge. You all set for your first day? I sure am. This is my husband, Henry. Hey there, nice to meet you. Henry, what a fine name. I'm a Henry, too! Oh, gosh! I have two Henrys in my life now! How about that! That's some nice looking wood. Yeah. Everything's seasoned. Starts easy, burns long. I'll have to order a cord. Well, talk to Denise. She handles the books. That Denise. What doesn't she do? - Darned if I know. - Stop, you two. All right, you take care of my girl, Henry. Let me know if she gives you any trouble. Will do, Henry. - Bye! - Bye, sweetheart. I'll see you tonight. Come on, after you. - Thank you, Mr. Kitteridge. - Call me Henry, for gosh sakes. Thank you, Henry. I had an idea, if you wouldn't mind me saying. No, not at all. Go ahead. You could put up a greeting card display, so while people were waiting for their prescriptions, they'd say to themselves, "Look at that. "I need to get a birthday card for my granddaughter, "or a get well card for my Aunt Betty." You know? I think that's inspired, Denise. - You do? - Yeah. I'm so glad! Jerry, you could help us put up the racks. Sure, I can do that. There you go. And you know people love to give cards to each other. - Yeah. - Yeah. Sometimes, I'll put a note in one of Henry's shoes. - Do ya? - Yeah. He'll stick his foot in, and get all grouchy, and say, "What the heck is this?" And then, he'll see the note, and he'll laugh. This one time, I tried to put my gloves on, but he had filled all the fingers with jellybeans. Oh, my gosh. I had no idea what was going on. I just kept jamming my fingers in. I just want to say one thing. Don't be scared of your hunger. If you're scared of your hunger, you're one more ninny just like everyone else. Doyle? Sweetheart, are you ready? Sorry, Louise. He's got 20 more minutes. He has an orthodontist appointment. Detention is over in 20 minutes. Really, Olive? Don't be ridiculous. You can have a seat while you wait. No, thank you anyway. Doyle, sweetheart, I'll be back. Mrs. Kitteridge? May I speak to you for a moment? I'll be out in the hall, and I'll know if you're talking. Tell me something. "Two roads diverged in a yellow wood. "And sorry I am, I could not travel both "And be one traveler, long I stood "And looked down one as far as I could "Until it bent... "...in the undergrowth" - You gonna pick that up? - Nope. Aren't you the brat? Olive, is Kevin Coulson in detention with you? Yeah, what's up? His mother called, and said she won't be able to pick him up. I can give him a ride if you want. We'll take care of it, Janet. All right, then. I'll let her know. She'll let her know. Thanks for the ride. No, stay. I'm gonna go check on your mother. Ma, let's just go. I want to get home. - I'll just be a minute. - No, it won't. Oh, dear God Almighty. Why don't I just walk? Be my guest. Do you good. Rachel? It's Olive Kitteridge. You're scaring your boy. Christ, I can't climb out of this. Well, get off the pills for one. They're doping you up. I'm not taking 'em. Are you collecting them again? I just want to go to sleep. You'll soil your pants when you die, you know. You want your son to see you like that? I wasn't gonna let Kevin find me here. I was gonna go out on my boat. That thing in the yard? - The hull looks cracked. - Well, then, let it sink. The cod can nibble my ears while I drift away. It'll screw him up for life. I'm a rock around his neck, Olive. He can't stand me. Yeah, my boy can't stand me, either. Doesn't mean we should oblige them by killing ourselves. Come on. Get up. Get up! Gotta start thinking about dinner. You set for something? Come on. I can... I don't know, make some chops. And what's your vegetable? - I can cook up some peas. - Good. And make some coffee while you're at it. - It'll perk you up. - All right. Gotta get going. I have my own dinner to make. Thanks for coming by, Olive. By the way, your son got a 98 on his math test. You could praise him for that. - See you tomorrow. - Bye. What are you doing? Stop that! That's what hoodlums do! What else am I supposed to do when you make me wait? I should have been home hours ago. Don't be selfish. Christopher, your friend needed a ride. He's not my friend! He's trash! Why would he be my friend? Don't you ever use that word, do you understand me? - Shame on you! - Sorry. Well, you should be! What if he heard you? Ma? You slapped me. Good God, Christopher. The world has seen worse. Why are you nicer to the bad kids than you are to me? Because you're my son. Poor you. Denise is bright. She's got a lot of good ideas. She's mousy, looks just like a mouse. Yeah, but a cute mouse. No one's cute that can't stand up straight. You know, her husband's a nice young fella. I think we ought to have 'em over for supper. Not keen on it. - He's a Henry, too. - Doesn't mean I want to cook for him. Sit up straight. You look like a thug in a pool hall. - What if I do? What's it to you? - Excuse me? Okay. All right. Chris, sit up. - I haven't done anything. - No, no. No, no. Let's just have a nice meal. She's the one who made me sit in the car for an hour with a smoker. Smell my shirt. - What smoker? - O'Casey. Smokes like a chimney. And he keeps the windows up. We took Kevin Coulson home. Rachel's not leaving the house again. You have to watch what you give her, Henry. Believe me, Olive, I am. Give her what? Never mind, son. You can talk in front of me. I know Kevin's mom's a whack job. - You are done here. - Why? You do not call people "whack jobs." You say it all the time! Rachel Coulson has depression. Do you know what that is? No. Not really. You should. It runs in our family. No, it doesn't. Henry, are you nuts? What do you think was going on with my father? That was a different thing. No, it wasn't. My mother had it, too. Well, not the same. I mean, she had her moods, but... She was clinical, Henry. What's depression? It's bad wiring. Makes your nerves raw. Is that why you're so mean all the time? Absolutely. Your mother is not depressed. Yes, I am. Happy to have it. Goes with being smart. All right, Ollie. We might as well discuss it, Henry. He might have it, too. But you don't think I'm smart. - Of course I do. - No, you don't. You think I'm average. You are plenty complicated, Christopher. Average is someone like Denise the Mouse. For God's sake. No, nothing wrong with it. Average people are happier. Are happy, happy, happy- You should try it sometime, Ollie. Can't, I'm too depressed. - Morning. - Morning. Jim. There you go. - Thank you so much. - You're welcome. Here, let me show you out. Have a good day, Mrs. Merriman. - Thank you. You, too. Bye-bye. - Bye. Watch your step. Thank you! Henry, guess what? - What? - Jerry has some news to tell you. - No, not a big deal. - Yes, it is! Jerry's been taking a night class in business, and he got an A on his test! That's wonderful, Jerry. I went to mass and prayed that I'd pass. Well, I think you passed because you studied hard. But I believe in prayer. Do you pray a lot, Jerry? I sure will now. I gotta get going. I got another delivery. Of course. Off you go. Thank you for your help, Jerry. Sure. Bye. You're a very good influence on him. I'm just trying to get him to have a little bit more confidence in himself. You know, his mother used to call him a dimwit. No! - Isn't that awful? - That's not right. My mother used to call me her skinny pencil. I was, I guess. I eat like a bird. I think you're the perfect weight. Thank you. Henry doesn't have an ounce of fat on him. He's all muscle. He was a football star. - He was? - Yeah. And the cheerleaders had a cheer just for him. "Let's go, Thibodeau! "Let's go!" Every time. - How do you like that? - Yeah. Oh, my goodness. That must have been something, I tell you. He was. Why he ever chose me... No. No, none of that. Stop it. Lucky to have you. - You know what we did last night? - What? Henry and I drove out to his parents' farm, and we dug potatoes. - Did you? - Yeah. Henry put the lights on in his truck so we could see, and we were all out there with our spades, seeing what we could find. It was like an Easter egg hunt. That's wonderful. And then when I got cold, Henry put me in his truck so I could warm up. And every time he found a potato, he'd hold it up for me to see. And I kept thinking to myself, "This is all too good to be true. "I don't deserve this." Course, you do. Well, I was always told not to expect too much. Well, whoever told you that was wrong. No, you have many years of happiness to come. You enjoy it, Denise. - Thank you. - Yeah. I will. You know, I think it's about time for you and Henry to come over for dinner. Well, we'd love that, but we don't want to put you out. Not at all. Olive would be delighted. There you are. I'm so glad you could make it. - Hello there, Henry. - Henry, hello. - Henry brought you some of his firewood. - Yeah, here you go. - Super. - We were gonna bring you flowers, - but we thought you'd like this better. - Yeah. Henry's wood burns like heaven. It'll make the warmest fires you'll ever see. Yeah. You don't see warmth. You feel it, dear. Oh, gosh. I guess you're right. Yeah, we all know what you mean. Come in, you two. Come on in. Okay. Thank you. You have a nice piece of land here. Well, there are two lots, actually. And we're planning to build on the other parcel if Christopher decides to stay. He'll have a house by the bay. Aw, isn't that neat? Christopher, do you like to go out on the water? Christopher. Answer, please. No. Not really. May I be excused? Go. Rinse your plate, please. Chris? Henry, leave it. For God's sake. So, Henry, what are your plans for the weekend? Me and my buddy Tony are going hunting. It's off season, isn't it? Yeah, but Tony got us a special license. He got this farmer to sign a thing saying the deer were eating his crops. It's not really fair, the poor little deer. Well, deer are pests. They're garden killers. Do you hunt, Henry? My father used to take me hunting. I was good at tracking. - Yeah? - Yeah. Well, tracking's the hardest part. Yeah, you gotta learn to think like a buck. Yeah, their main objective of course, is to find a fertile doe. And so, I used to be able to smell the droppings, and I could tell you if a deer was in heat. - You never told me that. - Yeah, it's true. Honey, can you do that? Smell a deer in heat? No. No, I usually just track by sight. Well, yeah. My Henry has eyes like a hawk. And apparently, my Henry has a nose like a wolf. Yeah. Well, Henry, why don't you come hunt with us? Tony's an easygoing guy, I'm sure he'd be glad to have you along. I haven't shot a gun in years. I'd be so rusty. That's all right. Tony's an awful shot! Tony only hunts to get away from his wife, right? Yeah, well, she's a nagger. She only nags because he still acts like a teenager. I never have to nag at you, honey, because you're a grown up. Hey, not always. I like to get a little crazy once in a while. Yeah, but when you do, it's so cute. He likes to dance in his underwear! Hey! Hey! A fellow needs to let go every once in a while! That's right. Henry, what do you do to let go? Hops trains. Really? Yeah. He disappears for weeks, comes back filthy dirty. I have to strip off his clothes and scrub him down. Oh, my gosh! She's playing with you, Denise. On! Can I help you, Mrs. Kitteridge? Sure. Thank you. Oh, my God. My goodness. So, I say to Marlene, "if you think I don't do enough, then make me a list, "'cause frankly, I don't got a fucking clue what you want from me." And she starts to cry, and says she's pregnant. I say, "Are you sure?" She says, "I might be." Which of course, she's not, she just does this to test me. Tony, will you shut up? You're gonna scare off the deer. Yeah, okay. Here we go. - Did you find something, Henry? - Yeah. Fresh scat. I'd say that's from a rabbit. Yeah. Yeah. All right. You two take this spot. - I'm gonna go check out that other trail. - Okay. - Jesus! - Oh, my fucking God. No! Shit, shit, shit. Henry, are you okay? I feel something. Here. All right. Let me look. Let me look. - Oh, Jesus Almighty! - Go get help. - Oh, Jesus! - Go get help! Go! No! No, no, no. Be calm. Just be calm. Okay. All right, just be still. Don't move. Keep your eyes open. Look at me. Look at me. Keep your eyes open. Tell Denise... ...that the oil in the truck needs to be changed. Okay. Stay with me. Come on, stay with me here, Henry. Stay. Henry? Stay with me, buddy. Henry? Oh, my God. Oh, sweet God. Oh, my God! They've been working there for a while. Here, sweetheart. His last words to me were so ordinary. Why would he want to talk about his truck if he knew he was dying? Well, he was in shock, Denise. He didn't know what he was saying. But still, wouldn't he want me to know that he loved me? If you need proof that you were loved, then you are in for one big, fat disappointment. Well, gosh. Mrs. Kitteridge, I guess you're right! I killed your only son! Hit me! I have nothing else to offer you! Do what you have to... - Someone remove this man, please? - Get away from him! An eye for an eye! Hit me! Get the hell away from me! I need to be punished! Shut up, son! Shut up, son. Tony! Henry, take her somewhere! Come on, Denise. Denise, come here. Okay. All right. All right. Nothing frightens God-fearing people more than when a good-natured man gets kicked into the abyss. She's completely helpless. People are never as helpless as they think they are. She doesn't even know how to drive a car. How the hell can you grow up in Maine and not know how to drive a car? I don't know. Somebody's gonna have to teach her. You're not. Oh, God, here we go. What? What? Just don't let her strip the damn gears in the car. No, no. Here you go. No, no. Wait, okay. - Sorry! - No, no. - Sorry. - It's okay. Yeah, yeah. Okay, easy. No. Just ease the brake. That's good. Yeah, yeah, yeah. On the road. Stay on the... Yeah. - Sorry! - It's okay. You're doing good. You're doing good. Stop. - Whoops! - Excellent. - Like that? - No, put it in park. Perfect. There you go. - I'm sorry. - Why? I'm just so awful at this. You're doing fine. It just takes practice. I hope I didn't hurt your car. No. Don't worry about it. You know, you should start this up every couple of days, keep it running. - I guess I should. - Yeah. You have the keys? They're still in there. We'll let it run for a minute. Would you like to have these? Oh, no. No. No, you keep them, Denise. You know, whenever you want to come back to work, just let me know. 'Cause you're missed. I'm just so tired. That's 'cause you don't eat. I mean, you're wasting away to skin and bones. I don't like to eat alone. Well, then you come to dinner. Yeah. - I don't want to put Mrs. Kitteridge out. - Don't be silly. That's what we're there for. I wonder if Henry was ever gonna get tired of me. No. Never. He loved you so much. He'd get impatient if I took too long brushing my teeth. Well, you know. Every couple gets annoyed with each other. But nothing about Henry ever annoyed me. He was perfect. Here. No. No, no. Sweetheart, no, no. Yeah. That'll do it. So, dinner then? Yeah. Thank you, Mrs. Kitteridge. This looks delicious. I don't know if it's delicious, but it'll fill you up. Thanks, Mom. So, how was school, son? - It was all right. - Just all right? That's what I said. Well, I have a story. Denise, you'll be interested in this. Marlene Bonney came in to pick up her prescription... - How's she doing? - The spots are all gone. I'm so glad. Yeah, yeah. So anyway, while she was waiting, she was over by your card rack. And, all of a sudden, I heard a yelp. And I was like, "Goodness, Marlene. Are you all right?" And she said, "Tomorrow's Ed's birthday, and I haven't done a thing about it!" Did she buy him a card? She bought him three. Oh, no! I don't have anyone left to send cards to, except my Aunt Jean. But she's blind. Okay. Go ahead and eat, Denise. I'm not very hungry. Well, you have to try. I know. Just one bite at a time. Here. Come on. Open up. Come on. Ready for another? - Yes, please. - Okay. Hot potato. Here you go. Here you go. Hey, carrot? Go ahead. All right. I'm enjoying your stew, Mrs. Kitteridge. Happy to hear it. You can clear your plate when you're done. Here. You're doing fine, Denise. You are. Another bean for you. Come on. Warm night for a fire, isn't it? Yeah. They're Henry's logs, so... - Well, he knew his wood. - Yeah, he did. Is she spending the night? Looks like she is, yeah. Give her a pillow so she doesn't drool on the couch. Here. Here, Denise. Put your head up. Henry, what are you doing? Well, it's Denise's first day back after three weeks, so, I thought I'd do something to cheer her up. Don't just start cutting things pell-mell. What in the hell's wrong with you? Why can't you allow me one simple act of kindness without making me feel like a sap? I was looking forward to the blooms, Henry. It's been a long winter. It's been a long winter for everyone, Olive. - Here. - No, take them. You cut them already. The deed is done. I don't want 'em. Suit yourself. - Good morning, Henry. - Morning, Denise. Welcome back. Oh, my God! Oh, my gosh! Is that for me? Yeah. Look at him! Look at his little face! Henry, how do you know how to do exactly the right thing for me? It's easy, Denise. Jerry, look! Look! Isn't he darling? Look at his tiny feet! Awful cute. Feel that. Feel it. His little heart is beating so fast. I'm gonna call you Whiskers. You like that? I think he likes it. - Do you? - I think he's perfect. That's your new home. You like it? Do you like it here? He will. I hope he does. I hope he does. Hey. Hey, Tony. What are you doing here? Tony's gonna teach me how to drive Henry's truck. Yeah. I know trucks. Yeah, I grew up on a farm. I know trucks as well. Look what Henry gave me! Isn't he just darling? - His name is Whiskers. - Yeah? Say hi! You wanna hold him? He'll cheer you right up. Denise, you want me to set up the litter box for you? No thank you, Henry. I can do it. Look at that. He's purring. Can you hear it? He likes you. Denise? Can I have a word with you? Sure. Yeah. I'll be right back. - Here okay? - Yeah, that's fine. Okay. Listen... I don't think you should drive with Tony. I don't know how stable he might be, you know? Oh, no, he's fine. And it makes him feel better if he can do things for me. Well, that's kind of you, but you need to be smart about this. You can be nice to anybody, but as long as it doesn't put you in danger. Well, gosh, I know that. I'm not a child, for gosh sakes. Well, okay. Let's hope you pass your driving test. I'll see you tomorrow, then. All right. Yeah. What in the hell ails you? Nothing. Nothing at all. What's new, then? Well, I got Denise a kitten. You got the mouse a cat? Don't call her that. What's the matter with you? Mom says it. It's unacceptable! Do you hear me? From now on, I don't want to hear either one of you ever calling Denise a mouse again. Do you understand? Yes, sir, Mr. President. So how was your day at school, son? O'Casey made me carsick again. Why's that? He drives too fast around the curves. I don't like the sound of that. I had a talk with him. That won't happen again. You know he's a reckless driver. Why do you let him drive our son? I'm sorry I'm such a rotten mother. Maybe when the mouse gets her license, she can drive us both places. Enough, Olive. Enough! Quit yelling. You think that makes you a man? How pathetic. You know what's pathetic? Your attitude. Don't you dare scold me! Where are you going? I'm gonna mow the lawn. Jesus, Ma. What's the problem? Morning, Jim. Henry. So, how are Irene and the kids? Yeah, still filling the house with endless noise and mirth. Irene stopped by the other day. I gave her something for Sean's cough. - Sean, the little one? - Yeah. Listen... I think it'd be a good idea if I took Olive and Chris to school. Yeah. Yeah, I think you're right. Just a second. Tony's here. Better be going. Mr. Mott will be in for his diuretic. You should remind him to eat a banana for potassium. I will. Hey, Mr. K. Hey, Denise. I have some news. I got accepted into U of M. - That's great news! - Good for you, Jerry. I'm gonna be majoring in business. Terrific! Excuse me, Jerry. I just thought I'd let you know. No, it's great news, Jerry. See you later. Henry? I asked Tony to take me to my driver's test because I didn't want to keep imposing on you. It's no imposition. You should know that by now. Tony has been having a really hard time. He needs someone to talk to. Well, Tony certainly didn't do your husband any favors, now did he? That was a horrible thing to say. I don't want to fight with you. I'm sorry! Neither do I. It's been horrible not talking to you. You poor girl. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I really do wish it was you who was taking me, Henry. I know. I know, I know. - I do. - I know you do. Denise, you're gonna pass that driver's test with flying colors. Yeah, 'cause I have faith in you, Denise. - I do. - Thank you, Henry. Thank you. Thank you! Thank you! Okay! Go get 'em! Henry! Henry! I passed! I knew it! That's so marvelous, Denise. Hi! Whiskers and me are gonna drive to the Foster Freeze and have ourselves an ice cream. You have a wonderful night. You've earned it. - Thank you. - Drive carefully. I will! I will! Say bye-bye. Bye! Bye, Whiskers. - Bye-bye! - Bye, Denise. Bye. Did young miss pass her driving test? Yes, she did. I expect you'll ask me to bake her a cake. I expect nothing, Ollie. If that's a sales person, hang the hell up. Hello, Kitteridge residence. Henry! Oh, God! - Denise? Denise, is that you? - Oh, God! Denise? Is that you? - I can't believe it. - Hello? Whiskers got out. I was backing up the truck and didn't see him. Oh, God. Stay where you are. I'll be right over. Okay. Okay. I'll be right over. Be right over. What's going on? Denise ran over her cat. Oh, Jesus. Go, Henry. Go. Go over and comfort your girlfriend. Stop it. That's unnecessary. She's a young widow who ran over her cat. Where in God's name is your compassion? She wouldn't have run over any goddamn cat if you hadn't given it to her. Here. This'll help you sleep. I talk to you in my head all the time. I'm sorry. - For what? - For talking to you in my head. No. No. What's going to become of me, Henry? I'm gonna take care of you, Denise. Come take my hand You should know me I've always been in your mind You know that I'll be kind I'll be guiding you I don't know if she has any. - Does she have any? - Doesn't she have her ex-husband on... No. I did not want it! Sometimes these things just happen. - It's magic. - Don't sing.
