The need for an urgent trip to bathroom find Olive stopping in at the local hospital to use their facilities but leads to something far more serious when two gun-toting addicts arrive looking for drugs. It leads to Olive and Henry having a major argument, blaming each other for Christopher having left home. She also reveals that she was once going to leave him. Christopher suggests they have counseling after their ordeal but Olive won't hear of it. After Henry suffers a stroke some months later, he is in home care.

 Mr. Kitteridge will be by once a week to mow the lawn, and I need to stop by to dead-head those roses. All right. Don't worry. I won't be talking to you. I do my job and then I go. Can we play with your dog? No. He doesn't like children. Don't throw balls in the flower beds, please. Keep the screen door closed. We have flies when there's no wind, and they bite. Towels and linens are on the bed. Any questions, phone number's right there. We do not answer the phone after 9:00 at night. All right, then. There you go.

 Clancy, come on. Let's go. Clancy! Come here. They all settled in? Like bugs in a rug. I'm gonna start lunch. You come in when you're done. Okay. What do you think? - Henry, that's nice. - That's a beautiful piece of wood. Henry Thibodeau gave us that wood. I think I'll give that to Denise. Yeah. Ol' What's-His-Name won't like that. Eating salad out of dead Henry's bowl? Well, Jerry doesn't need to know.

 That's right. To hell with him. Afternoon. Kitteridge residence. Pop, it's me. Chris! How are you, son? I need to talk to both of you. Is Mom there? Yeah, she's right here. Is everything okay? Yeah. Just, why don't you both get on? Okay, hold on. I'll get on the other line. He wants to talk to both of us. - What's going on? - I don't know. I'll pick up in here. - Hi, Christopher. It's your mother. - Hi, Mom. Is Dad on? Yeah, your father's getting on the line. - Henry, are you on there? - Yep, yep. Okay. All right, go ahead. Did you and Suzanne try going to counseling? Yeah, we went for a couple of months, but we knew it wasn't gonna work out. I'm just... I'm so sorry. I'm okay with it, Pop. Really, I am. Did you fall in love with someone else? - No. - Did she? I don't know. So she was having an affair. Ultimately, that is not really the point. We were just a wrong match. - I don't know what to say. - I'm fine with it, Pop. It is what it is. Well, you come home then. You can have your house. It's only rented till the end of July. I'm staying here. I like California, and my practice is doing well. Well, you have a good practice here. Everyone asks if you're ever coming back. I don't wanna come back, Pop. Do as you wish, Christopher. It's your life. I have something on the stove. Okay. Mom, I... Jesus. - Chris, you there? - Yep. I'm sorry, son. I... Well, I really liked Suzanne. She liked you, too. Maybe come visit? We'll see. I'm pretty busy right now. Listen, I have to call you back. I'm at the office. I'm sorry. I don't wanna keep you. - Okay, so you take care of yourself, son. - Thanks, Pop. You, too. All right. Bye. Well, I did not see that one coming. Did you? - What do you think happened? - The bloom wore off. She thought she could do better. That's the type she is. He married an opportunist. I thought he was calling to tell us Suzanne was pregnant. Well, not to be. We should sell the house. I don't want any more renters. Well, he could change his mind. He's a grown man, Henry. Why should he want to live next door to us? Yeah. Why should he? Are you going to eat that? Not right now, Ollie. Go do something, Henry. All right. I Will. Henry? Henry, where are you? Oh, my God. I'm so tired of yelling my brains out. Henry? What are you doing? You know, I always thought that someday I'd bring the grandkids up here, show 'em their dad's old train set. We'd dust it off and put the tracks together, get it running again. Maybe I'll set it up anyway. - Henry? - What? Snap out of it. Thank you. - Hi, Henry! - Hey, Ed. - Hi, Carol. - Hi, Henry. - Thank you! - You're welcome. - Thank you, Henry! - Hey, Stan the Man. You're welcome, buddy. You in line? I am. It's not like the old days, is it? Excuse me? Well, the service isn't what it used to be. You know... No, it isn't. Okay. All set? No. I don't know what in God's name is going on back there, but... - Hello. - Hi. Henry Kitteridge. My pharmacy used to be here. Of course! Yeah, we used to use you. You did, yeah. - Jack! - Yeah? This is our old pharmacist. Do you remember? Yes! Hi, hi. Listen. Henry, we're taking a cruise to Belize next week. Can you recommend something for sea sickness? Well, I always recommend Dramamine. Would you like me to get it for you? Thank you, Henry. That's very kind. Sure. Oh, boy. I forgot it was that time of year. Excuse me? Father's Day. Yeah. Did you send yours off yet? - My what? - A card to your dad? No, hadn't thought about it. No? I'm sure he'd appreciate it. It's a made-up holiday. I don't think he cares. Well, everybody likes to get a card. It's a nice reminder that you're thinking about 'em. My dad doesn't want to know what I think about him. Gee, that's too bad. No, it isn't. Attention, pharmacy. You have a call holding on line three. Line three, please. Clancy, no! Oh, God. - Clancy! Come here. Come on! - Don't reward him for running at the car. He's okay. Oh, my God. He's okay. Yes. - What's this? - I thought they were unusual. Thank you, Henry. I love you, Ollie. Yeah, you too, Henry. Clancy, come on. Clancy! How much do I love you? I'll tell you no lie Does Christopher have a lawyer? He didn't say. We didn't ask. Well, if she's a greedy gump, he's gonna need one. We think it's fairly amicable. She wanted out. She thought she could do better. - Well, you don't know that, Ollie. - Well, sure I do. Good riddance. What about the house here? It's under his name. That's good. One less thing to grab. You think he'll move back? - He still could. - Not in a million years. Well, thank God they didn't have kids. That could have been a real nightmare. Who has the crab cakes? Right here. Over here. Thank you very much. - Anyone mind if I start? - No, go right ahead. So how are your grandkids? They're spiteful. Really? You know what the little one said to me the other day? She looked me right in the eye and she said, "You may be my grandma, but that doesn't mean I have to love you." Then the other one looked at me and she said, "Me, too." Oh, gosh. That's rotten. - Ha! - Did you talk to Julie about that? Well, she encourages it. She wants them to be able to express themselves. - For God's sake. - That's no good. - She needs to teach them better manners. - Yeah. Well, that's not gonna happen. She's rude to me as well. Can't win. Even when you do your best. No, you can't win. Well, to hell with her. To hell with all of 'em. - Yeah. - That's what I say. How high is the sky? - That was great. - Sure was. Just awful. Those rotten grandchildren, talking to Bonnie like that. It's just... They sound like real hellions. That Julie's not much. Bonnie always talked about her like she was God's gift. - You never really know what goes on. - No, you do not. I ate too much. - Want a Rolaid? - Yes, please. But you know, if you think about it, Suzanne would have raised her kids the same way. Well, I don't think Christopher would have allowed any rudeness. But it's the mother they listen to. I'm sure you'd have straightened them out, Ollie. You bet I would. You know, I was thinking. We should take a trip together. Wouldn't that be nice? Yeah. Someplace warm like Bermuda, maybe a cruise? I'd rather go someplace on our own. You get a lot of dopes on a boat. Yeah. No, you're right about that. And we'd see a lot more on our own. Godfrey! - What's the matter? - I need a bathroom. Well, we'll be home in 10 minutes. Can you hold on? My bowels are about to explode. Just try to hold on. I don't think I can. You need to find something, Henry. Well, I'm trying. I'm looking. Let's go. Yeah. - Hold on. - My bowels are about to explode. - Just hold on! - Go to the hospital, go to the hospital. Are you sure? - Yes. Run the light, Henry. Run the light. - No! - Henry, run the light! - I can't! Go! There's nobody else around. Go! Oh, God. Go to the emergency entrance. What are you doing? There, there. - All right, all right. - Go, go! Go on! Go on, Henry! Go, go, go. Wait, don't hit the lady! Go. - Okay, stop, stop here. Stop. - Hang on. All right, I'll wait. I'll wait here for you, but if they want me to move, I'll come in and look for you. Yeah, right! All right. Go, go, go. I need a bathroom. It's right across the hall. Godfrey. How much do I love you? I'll tell you no lies You all right? All clear. Diarrhea? Explosive. I had dinner with friends, and I ate everything in sight. - I'm fine now, thank you very much. - Any vomiting? Excuse me? - Did you have any vomiting? - No, none of that. You seem pretty short on business tonight. Well, weekends, we pick up. Well, I'm sure you have a lot of fools that pass through here who drink and drive and crash into trees. We get all kinds of situations. We had a man come in who sawed off his finger with a chainsaw. I mean, he was smart enough to put the finger on ice, so we got it back on, good as new. Good. I was born here in the old wing. That's so neat. Welcome back. And they brought my father's body in here. I don't know why. He couldn't have been more dead. Well, people can be revived after a heart attack. We've done that. No, he, blew his head off. He was dead, dead, dead. I'm sorry. No, no need. It's just a fact. All right. Going home now. Thanks much. But the doctor's ready to see you. No, I don't need to see a doctor. I just needed a john. Are your ears always that red? Why, am I getting ready to die? Did you have any shellfish? Just a couple of crab cakes. We lost a woman in here just the other night. She had been out to dinner with her husband and had crab. She came in here with diarrhea, and three hours later, she was dead of anaphylactic shock. For God's sake. - Are you allergic to shellfish? - Never have been. Well, that can change. Do your palms itch? Not that I can tell. Well, we better have the doctor take a look at you, just to be safe. All right. Let me just tell my husband. Henry. They want to check me out. - Are you all right? - Yes. Some dumb woman died of crab meat here, and they're afraid they're gonna get sued. - You want me to come in with you? - No. I'm fine. You better park the car, though. God knows how long they're gonna take with me. Seems business is slow in there. How long ago did you have the crab cakes? About two hours ago. Did you have anything else? A steak, a baked potato, creamed spinach, a puny little salad, but with a nice dressing on it, and a lovely piece of cheesecake. Your blood pressure is a little on the high side. - Are you on any medication? - No. I'm just gonna check your lymph nodes. I don't see any sign of a rash. - You having any more abdominal pain? - I'm just a little queasy. This could just be a case of gastro reflux. But we should examine you. If you could put this on, everything off, open in front. For heaven's sake. Do I have to? We want to make sure you're all right, Mrs. Kitteridge. Better safe than sorry. For God's sake. Have you ever been to the Florida Keys? They have boat trips where you can swim with dolphins. Wouldn't that be something? I'll have to look into that. And have you ever thought about going to Cuba? You'd have to fly out of Toronto because of the restrictions and all, but I hear it's really neat. All the cars are from the 1950s. Well, that'd be a fascinating trip then, wouldn't it? I think my wife would enjoy that. I love Cuban music. Do you? Do you and your wife like to dance? Well, we haven't in years, but you know, it's always something... Don't fucking move! Stupid. Stupid, stupid, stupid. This is just ridiculous. Hello? I'm ready. May we please proceed? For God's sake. Well, it's about time. - Get down! - Hey, now! Get down! I said get down! Down where? Be clear! Come on, just grab this shit! He said fucking move, you bitch! Move! Where the fuck is it? - Come on! Come on! Let's fucking go. - Shit! Fucking move it! Come on! Fucking go! Go! Hurry up! Come on, hurry the fuck up! Fucking go, you bitch! Hurry up. In there! Get in there! In there! Olive! Olive, did they hurt you? Shut the fuck up! Hands behind your back. You, hands behind your fucking back! Don't say another word, old man, I will fucking blow your head clean off. No, don't wrap her hands too tight, please. You're gonna cut off the circulation. Quiet. Don't wrap it so tight. Shut the fuck up! Get down. Get down! On the fucking ground! Get down! I'm trying, I'm trying. Well, help her, for God's sake. Fucking help her. Any of you fucking move, you will get shot in your fucking head. Don't anyone look at me, or I'll shoot your fucking heads off. Sir? Sir? Would you please cover up my wife? She's all exposed. - God, Henry! - Oh, Jesus, lady. Well, what was I supposed to do? These stupid people wanted to have me examined. - Don't look at me! - Okay. That's the first decent thing you've done tonight. Shut up! Get your fucking head down! There's no need for that. You don't have to speak so filthy. What'd you say to me, old man? What the fucking-fuck did you say? You'll get us all killed! What the fuck did you say to me? Answer me! What the fuck did you say to me? I said you don't need to talk so filthy. You should be ashamed of your mouth. Please! Please, please, please! He got that from his mother. Just ignore him. - This guy your husband? - Yes. Well, he's a fucking nut. He can't help it. He can't help it. You would have had to know his mother. She was just full of pious crap. Oh, God. Oh, God. Okay, no. No, Patricia. - Oh, God! - It's gonna be fine. Shut up! This young woman needs some comfort. Please allow me that. Are you a fucking preacher? No. He just can't help himself. He has to give comfort to cute little mice. He'd risk his life to save a mouse in distress. Fuck is that supposed to mean? My wife is scared. She's just saying things, just saying things. I want both of you to shut up, okay? My son used to have acne also. There are things that you can use - to clear it up, you know. - Shit, lady! The main thing is you've got to stop touching your face. That aggravates it. Okay, lady. Just shut up, all right? Everyone, just be quiet. What the fuck? What the fuck are you doing? What the fuck did you take your mask off for, you retard? Well, it's too late now, you dumb shit! Fuck! Listen to me. Tape their fucking mouths shut. Yeah? Any of you fucking move, you will get shot in your fucking head. Tape their mouths shut, fucking do it. I'm gonna be right back. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen. Quiet. Stop it. Stop with that. Olive, leave her alone. Henry, really. Who are you trying to impress? You have known this girl for less than an hour, and you're trying to show her what a saint you are? Enough. Enough! Mr. Perfect, that's who you are. Hey, you wanna know why our son left? He couldn't live up to his father's perfect record as a perfect man. No, no, no. No, he left home because she made his life unbearable! Unbearable! You and your terrible judgment! Both of you stop, please! Do you know what your saintly mother said to me when my father committed suicide? She said that he'd committed a sin and was going to hell. How's that for judgment? How's that for Christian charity, Henry? Jesus Christ, shut up! Let's try and be calm. Let's try and be quiet! - Shut up, you. - Why are you so hateful, Olive? Because you were too goddamned simple for me, Henry. I should have left you years ago. Well, why the hell didn't you, then? I was going to, but he's dead. You wouldn't have lasted two weeks with him. His drinking would have disgusted you. And you wouldn't have lasted two weeks with your little mouse. She was half your age and dull as a rock. - Well, ain't I a sap? - We both are, Henry. We're just both big saps. Please. She won't be able to breathe. Please! Just shut up. Put the gun down. Freeze! In here! We're in here! Help! Oh, Christ! Fuck. Oh, Christ. Oh, no. Oh, no! Don't! Drop your weapon! Drop your weapon! Okay, easy, easy. My guess is they weren't going to shoot us until they finished stealing whatever drugs they were looking for. But a male nurse was coming in for his shift, and he called the police before they could do the deed. - Jesus. - Yeah. Yeah. But... I talked to the fellow afterward, and he told me that... - Really? - Yeah. And he said he saw your mother's clothes thrown all over one of the cubicles, and so you know, he knew something was wrong. Is Mom okay? - I'm sorry. Say it again, Chris? - Is Mom okay? No, no, she's fine. She's fine. - She's here. You want to talk to her? - Yeah. Here, it's Christopher. He wants to talk to you. - Hello, Chris. - Mom, how are you doing? I'm doing fine. I'm alive. - Are you gonna talk to someone? - What do you mean? You and Dad should get some counseling. Especially Dad. He's acting like everything's fine, but he's gonna crash, and get really depressed. Well, it's just ducky you're worried about your father at this point. Excuse me? Good night, now. I'm going to bed. - Chris? - What the hell, Dad? What the hell? It's not you, son. It's just your mother's been through a terrible ordeal. She's not herself. All I was saying to Mom was that I think you should get some counseling. - Well... - That's all I was saying. You know, I think we're gonna do some traveling. Yeah? Maybe we'll come out and visit you! Sure. Well, we'll see. Your mother doesn't like to leave her garden this time of year. - Sure. - All right. - Was that the dog? - Yeah. Having his midnight snack. That's nice. Look, son. We'll be fine. Your mother and I will be... Don't worry about us. Okay, Pop. I'm glad you're okay. - Take care of yourself, all right? - I will. Okay, good night. Hey, buddy. There's a good boy. That's my good boy. Such a good boy. I know. Ollie? Want something to help you sleep? No. I do not want to get started on those things. They're mild enough. You won't get hooked. Well, you go ahead. Knock yourself out. You like something to help settle your stomach? Yes, thank you. Please. Thanks. Olive... Let's not. Let's not talk about it, Henry. Let's just erase it from our minds. I'll take this out. Henry, what are you doing? Just looking at the bay, Ollie. Is that all right? I saw Harmon at the post office. Why don't you call him? I will. Would you turn that thing off, please? It's depressing. Listen, Henry. I don't remember what I said that night, but I could not stand that little nurse and all her Catholic mumbo-jumbo. And then you started to defend her, and I knew that you knew better. You know what, Ollie? I don't think in all the years that we've been married, in all the years, I don't think you've ever, ever apologized to me, for anything. Sorry, sorry, sorry. I'm sorry I'm such a hell of a rotten wife. Olive... Listen. We were so scared that night. It was a situation that no one should ever, ever have to be in. We were frightened. We said some things. We'll get over it in time. No! Hey! Hey! No! Ollie, did you hit the dog? He was running straight at the wheels! For God's sake, he's got to learn sometime, Henry. All right. You didn't even see him, Henry. You could have run him right over. All right, Ollie. See? He's fine. Did you get my mulch? Yep. Watch your back. Don't carry it yourself. For God's sake, let me get the wheelbarrow. No, no. I can do it. Well, suit yourself then. Quiet! Those aphids better not come back. Jerks. Quiet, you! Henry? Dear God. What happened? Henry, what happened? Henry, can you hear me? Henry? No, don't close your eyes, Henry. Henry, look at me. Look at me, Henry. Henry? Christopher's here. Jesus, Ma. Christopher, he can hear you. For God's sake. Henry, Christopher is with me. We just got back from the airport, and the traffic was lousy. Hello, Pop. The more you talk to him, the more he responds. How you doing, Pop? Hold his hand. He likes to be touched. Hiya, Pop. Here you go. I'm gonna let you two have a visit. Mom, where are you going? Godfrey, Christopher. How old are you? He's your father. Just talk to him. Okay. Here. His toenails need clipping. Move his chair so he can see the flowers. He misses the garden. I saw a bunion on his right foot. There's some swelling here on his metatarsal phalangeal joint. How long has he had this? I don't know. He never let me near his feet. Well, I see a couple of corns. You need to keep better care of his feet. Well, that's your department, mister. I'll be back, Henry. Come on, come on! Let's surly down to a stoned soul picnic There'll be lots of time and wine Red, yellow, honey... How are you doing, Mrs. Kitteridge? - Doing just fine. - I wanted to tell you we have a wonderful support group that's meeting here tonight. My son is visiting. I'm not gonna leave him at home to go talk to a bunch of strangers. But he's welcome, too. It's for the whole family. Thank you, we're not those types. Well, we're here if you need us. Sap. And from the sky Come the Lord and the lightning I don't know how you can stand that place, Ma. I can't, Chris. It's lousy. What can I do? I can't take care of him on my own. No, of course you can't. He's a big guy. It would be too much for you. Well, I do what I can for him. I take him food from home, and then when I'm there I give him an extra wash. Just for the record, your father's the only one in the place that doesn't smell like a dirty sponge. I'm thinking of selling your house. All the upkeep. It's a lot of upkeep, renting it to all the summer people. Unless you want to keep it in the family, of course. No, you should go ahead and sell it. Well, go over there tomorrow and see if there's any furniture you want. No, you can keep it. Didn't What's-Her-Name clean you out? No, she didn't. And you can say her name. She's not Satan. Are you dating yet? No. I'm in therapy. You can't do both? It's not advisable, no. I'm sure you talk about what a rotten mother I was. We talk about a lot of things. There was nothing wrong with your childhood. The biggest trauma you ever had was when Sparky got hit by a car. It's not just about trauma. I think it's stupid to dwell on the past. Let's not have this conversation, all right? You had a normal, happy childhood, just for the record. Okay, Ma. I'll let my therapist know. Dad's sight is gone. Not necessarily. I'm afraid it is. I flicked my fingers in front of his eyes, and he didn't respond. Is that what you were doing instead of talking to him? I did talk to him. How do you think he feels, you flicking at him? He wasn't even aware, Mom. He barely responds. - You don't know. - The stroke really fried him. You're not a doctor. You don't know. Excuse me? You're a podiatrist. It doesn't count. - Thank you. - Don't be offended. It's a fact. I am offended. That was a shitty thing to say. And who are you to go snapping your fingers in your father's face? Who the hell are you? I wasn't snapping my fingers. Jesus Christ! Did you even bother to say three words to him? - Yes! - What? Do you want a transcript? I want to know what you said that was so goddamn wonderful. Nothing, Mom. Nothing. I'm a fucking idiot, all right? No, you're just selfish. You're just selfish. You couldn't bother to come right out and see your father. You're the one who told me that I didn't have to come. Because it was very clear from your calls you didn't really wish to. Oh, my God. Admit it. You know I'm right. No, Ma. No! You need to admit that you say these horrible things to me that make me want to crawl into a hole and die. - So dramatic. - You do! All the fucking time! You never call me, so how could that be true? I don't want to fucking call you, because you make me feel like shit. Stop with the horrible language. Screw my language! You know what my shrink says? He says it's a fucking wonder I'm even standing after all the crap you said to me when I was a kid! - What crap? Give me an example. - Abusive crap! Putting me down! You say crazy, destructive things, and you then act like nothing fucking happened. Just admit it. Admit it for fucking once. Admit that you were a horrible mother! Christopher, please. You've got to stop yelling at me. I almost got murdered and I've just lost my dearest companion. I need someone to be nice to me. Okay, Ma. Okay. There's ice cream. Sure. Yes, please. Bye, Mom. Bye. Take care. Travel safe. I will, Ma. Have your tickets out, please. - Here you go. - Thank you. Thank you. Watch your step boarding the aircraft, sir. Thank you. All right, that's it. Let's go. Thank you. Look who's here, Henry. Chris is on his way home. He says he'll be back real soon. And he is just crazy about you, Henry. Kept going on about what a wonderful father you are. Say again, Henry. Go ahead. - Hello, Olive. - Cynthia. I am so, so sorry about Henry. Nothing to be sorry about. We all know these things can happen. Not many are lucky enough to just drop dead in their sleep. How are you doing? Just fine. You know, my daughter Andrea, she's got a degree in social work now. I told her about everything that happened to you, and she said she would be glad to talk to you. I remember Andrea in my class. Not too bright with the math. Glad she found her calling. All right, Olive. It's nice to see you. Doyle? Sweetheart, are you ready? Sorry, Louise. He's got 20 more minutes. He has an orthodontist appointment. Detention is over in 20 minutes. Really, Olive? Don't be ridiculous. You can have a seat while you wait. - Hello, Olive. - Hello, Louise. Do come in. I've set up tea in the living room. You can leave your purse here, if you like. Can't stand a quiet house. Tick, tick, tick. I'm sure you miss having Henry there. It's an adjustment. He was always such a kind and pleasant man, a pure delight to be around. I wouldn't go that far. I've always enjoyed your candor, Olive. Let me pour for you. I hear that one of your young men is staying at the same facility as Doyle. What young man? The one who tried to rob you? If you ever pay him a visit, I'm sure that Doyle would also love to see you. Why on earth would I pay him a visit? There's something about being held captive by someone. You get attached. Nobody believes this now, of course, but Doyle is the sweetest soul alive. Quite a day, Henry. I went to see Louise Larkin because she sent me a note. I thought she was reaching out to me, but it turns out she's completely out of her mind. She's not just crazy, she's wicked crazy. She despises her husband. She despises everyone. The nicest words she had to say about anyone was about you, Henry. She said you were the kindest man in the world, which is true. You were born kind. You grew up kind. And then you married a beast and loved her. You had a son who has grown up complicated, but at least he'll never bludgeon a girl to death. You were endlessly kind to townspeople who came to you for their medicine. You soothed their ills in your clean white coat. You've had a good life, Henry. You have. You can die now, sweetheart. It's all right. I'll be right here. You won't have to do it alone. Love you, Henry. I hear that one of your young men is staying at the same facility as Doyle. The one who tried to rob you? If you pay him a visit... Why on earth would I pay him a visit? There's something about being held captive by someone. You get attached. I haven't given that boy a second thought. I've always enjoyed your candor, Olive. How is Christopher? He's living in California. He's doing very well. Does he get out here much to help you? Sure. Sure, he has. Sure. Sure, he has. Come now. He was always such a sensitive boy, just like Doyle. I'm sorry. I'm not setting a very good example for you. What do you mean? On how to cope with being pitied. But still, you're here for lessons. No, I came because you wrote me a nice note, Louise. I've always enjoyed your candor, Olive. But did Christopher? It's a fucking wonder I'm even standing after all the crap you said to me. You and your terrible judgment! I don't wanna fucking call you, because you make me feel like shit. You've probably thought about killing yourself. Killing yourself. I hardly see how that would solve anything. But it would. It would solve everything. But the question is of how to do it. You, I don't see you as a pills person. Something more aggressive. The wrists. But that would take so long. I think I'll be going now, but I do appreciate that you sent that note. You came for a nice dose of schadenfreude and it didn't work. Sorry. Sorry. Thank you for the tea, Louise. I'll see myself out. What have you got in that purse of yours? It's as big as a suitcase. What are you hiding in there? What are you hiding in there? I have always wanted to have a neighbor. Mrs. Kitteridge? Mrs. Kitteridge? Mrs. Kitteridge? Mrs. Kitteridge? You need to wake up. Mrs. Kitteridge? - What? - If you could get up, please. Mr. Kitteridge needs to be changed. Excuse me, please. I'll be back later, Henry. I'm gonna go home and feed the dog. All right, let me give it a try. - Hello, Olive. - Angela. You caught me. I know you've told me a million times to quit. Well, who am I to tell people what's best for them? Who the hell do I think I am?
