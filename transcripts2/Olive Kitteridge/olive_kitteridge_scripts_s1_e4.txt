 - Henry: Morning, Lois. - Lois: It's cold, I'd like to get in. Woman: I have places to be today. Could you just let him know that I'm here? Lois: He'll be with you in a minute, dear. No need to stand right in front of me. Hey, Rachel. What can I do for you? - I need this filled. - Okay. Uh, Lois, why don't you go get a cup of coffee? I'll take the register. - Suit yourself. - [Henry grunts] - Rachel, this isn't your regular doctor. - That's right. Well... Well, um... I'll have to let him know that we already have a prescription for Valium for you on file. Why would you have to do that? Well, you know I cannot double up your dose. I don't feel like coming in here... to pick up more pills, that's the whole point. Maybe a couple of extra trips into town is just the thing you need. It's good to get out when you're feeling blue. Christ, Henry. Blue is what I feel on the good days. Oh. Let me ask you something. How much wattage do you use in your light bulbs? - I don't know. - Sixty watts? - Yeah, probably. - Not enough in the winter. If you have a gloomy house, you'll never get out of your funk. Wanna pay my electric bill? I want you to go next door to Harmon's and get a couple of hundred-watt bulbs and use them till the days get longer, and then you can switch back to the lower watts. Yeah? You're not gonna fill my prescription, are you? No. Sorry, Rachel. I cannot. You know, I'll just go to a pharmacy in another town. Well, maybe the drive will do you good. Henry? We need you out here. Lois took a spill. Oh, dear God. Excuse me, Rachel. She came in to get a coffee. She seemed just fine. Then she walked out, she just kind of crumbled. - Lois? Lois, you hear me? - You want me to slap her, Henry? No. She stopped breathing. Call an ambulance. - Man: Who is that? - [Henry exhaling] Woman: It's Lois. I just saw her walking... [Woman speaking indistinctly] [Henry exhaling sharply] She's dead, Henry. - She's left the building. - [Bone cracks] Oh! Oh, sweet Jesus. Oh, dear God. Oh, you should fix that. You know, her panties. Oh... [Siren approaching] [Sighs] Christopher? I got some very... sad news to tell you. - What? - Mrs. Granger died today. She went to the donut shop to get a cup of coffee and on the way back, she had a stroke. She was alive this morning, now she's gone. She's gone, son. - Who's Mrs. Granger? - [Olive laughs] [Chuckles] Chris, for God's sake, you know who she is. She's been working for me since before you were born. Oh, stop, Henry. You couldn't stand the old bat. - [Christopher laughs] - Enough. Let's be respectful. - Don't pretend to be sad. - What? - She was due to kick, and now you're free. - Well, she wasn't a pleasant woman. But all the same, she was once someone's child. And kittens grow into cats. Poor Lois. Let's hope she's at peace. Well, now you can hire someone young and cute who thinks you're God. Won't that be nice? It will, actually. Mm... So how's school, son? - Fine. - He's getting a "C" in English. O'Casey doesn't grade fairly. I always do my work, I'm never late, and he gives me a "C"? - Well, that doesn't sound quite right. - It isn't, Dad. - Your son doesn't understand subtext. - Oh. Well, I don't really understand subtext either. Oh, God, Henry. Well, I mean, I think if Christopher is putting forth his best efforts... I read your son's paper, it is lazy, slapdash crap. That's a little harsh, Ollie. You don't know. You're not there. Olive: Jim O'Casey understands your son's abilities more than you do. Well... Olive: He understands when they're being squandered. You want your kid to grow up to be a dope, go ahead. Uh, we're not finished yet. [Dishes rattling] Would you like me to help you with your homework, son? No. May I be excused? Yeah. Go ahead. [Dishes rattling] Go. Go! Ollie? Olive: No, I don't need to talk about it, Henry. I'm done. All right. - Henry: You threw away my card. - Olive: I already read it. Henry: You don't wanna save it? [Sighs] Don't be hurt. You know I don't like clutter. There. It's up now for all to see. _ - [Ship horn blares] - [Birds squawking] ♪ _ [Woman speaks indistinctly] Give me a kiss. Mm! Mm! Oh! - You're gonna do great today. - Do I look okay? You look beautiful. Mm! - Good morning, Denise. - Good morning, Mr. Kitteridge. You all set for your first day? I sure am. Oh, this is my husband, Henry. - Hey, there. Nice to meet you. - Henry, what a fine name. - I'm a Henry too. - Oh, gosh! - I have two Henrys in my life now! - How about that? [Laughs] That's some nice-looking wood. Yeah, everything's seasoned, starts easy, burns long. - I'll have to order a cord. - Talk to Denise. She handles the books. Oh, that Denise. What doesn't she do? - Darned if I know. - Stop! You two! - Come here. - [Kisses and chuckles] All right, you take care of my girl, Henry. You let me know if she gives you any trouble! - Will do, Henry. - Bye! Bye, sweetheart. I'll see you tonight. - Come on, after you. - Thank you, Mr. Kitteridge. Oh, call me Henry, for gosh sakes. Denise: Oh, thank you, Henry. [Bell jingles] [Church bell tolling] I had an idea, if you wouldn't mind me saying. No, not at all. You could put up a greeting card display, so while people were waiting for their prescriptions, they'd say to themselves, "Oh, look at that. I need to get a birthday card for my granddaughter." Or "a get-well card for my Aunt Betty." You know? I think that's inspired, Denise. - You do? - Oh, yeah. - Oh, I'm so glad. - Jerry? You could help us put up the racks, huh? - Yeah, sure, I can do that. - Oops. [Laughs] There you go. And you know people love to give cards to each other. - Oh, yeah. Yeah. - Yeah. Sometimes, I'll put a note in one of Henry's shoes. - Do you? - Yeah. [Laughs] He'll stick his foot in and get all grouchy and say, - "What the heck is this?" - [Laughs] And then he'll see the note, and he'll laugh. [Chuckles] This one time, I tried to put my gloves on, but he had filled all the fingers with jelly beans. [Laughs] - [Laughing] - My gosh! I had no idea what was going on. I just kept jamming my fingers in. [Laughing] [Continues laughing] I just want to say one thing. Don't be scared of your hunger. If you're scared of your hunger, you're one more ninny just like everyone else. [Door opens] Doyle, sweetheart, are you ready? Sorry, Louise. He's got 20 more minutes. He has an orthodontist appointment. Detention is over in 20 minutes. Really, Olive, don't be ridiculous. You can have a seat while you wait. No, thank you, anyway. Doyle, sweetheart, I'll be back. Man: Mrs. Kitteridge. May I speak to you for a moment? I'll be out in the hall, and I'll know if you're talking. Tell me something. "Two roads diverged in a yellow wood." [Laughs] "And sorry I am I could not travel both and be one traveler. Long I stood and looked down one as far as I could. Until it bent... in the undergrowth." - You gonna pick that up? - Nope. [Apple crunches] Mm... - Aren't you the brat? - Mm-hmm. Woman: Olive, is Kevin Coulson in detention with you? Yeah, what's up? His mother called, said she won't be able to pick him up. I can give him a ride, if you want. - [Apple crunches] - We'll take care of it, Janet. All right, then. I'll let her know. She'll let her know. ♪ [Knock on door] [Rock music playing] ♪ Then you ask why I don't live here ♪ - Thanks for the ride. - No, stay. I'm gonna go check on your mother. Ma, let's just go. - I wanna get home. - It'll just be a minute. No, it won't. Oh, dear God almighty, why don't I just walk? Olive: Be my guest. Do you good. [Match lights] [Door slams] [Knocks] Rachel? It's Olive Kitteridge. [TV playing indistinctly] Listen to this first prize. It's a car! You're scaring your boy. Christ, I can't climb out of this. Well, get off the pills, for one. They're doping you up. Rachel: I'm not taking 'em. Are you collecting them again? I just wanna go to sleep. You soil your pants when you die, you know. You want your son to see you like that? Rachel: I wasn't gonna let Kevin find me here. I was gonna... go out on my boat. That thing in the yard? The hull looks cracked. Then let it sink. The cod can nibble my ears while I drift away. - It'll screw him up for life. - I'm a rock around his neck, Olive. - He can't stand me. - My boy can't stand me either. Doesn't mean we should oblige them by killing ourselves. Now come on, get up. Get up. Gotta start thinking about dinner. You set for something? Come on. [Sighs] I can... I don't know, make some chops. And what's your vegetable? [Sighs] - I can cook up some peas. - Good. And make some coffee while you're at it. It'll perk you up. - Rachel: All right. - Olive: Gotta get going. I have my own dinner to make. Thanks for coming by, Olive. By the way, your son got a 98 on his math test. You could praise him for that. [Door closes] - Olive: See you tomorrow. - Kevin: Bye. What are you doing? Stop that. That's what hoodlums do. What else am I supposed to do when you make me wait? I should've been home hours ago. Don't be selfish. Christopher, your friend needed a ride. He's not my friend. He's trash! Why would he be my friend? Don't you ever use that word. Do you understand me? - Shame on you! - Sorry. Well, you should be. What if he heard you? Ma, you slapped me. Good God, Christopher, the world has seen worse. Why are you nicer to the bad kids than you are to me? Because you're my son. Poor you. Denise is bright. She's got a lot of good ideas. She's mousey, looks just like a mouse. Yeah, but a cute mouse. No one's cute who can't stand up straight. You know, her husband's a nice, young fellow. I think we ought to have them over for supper. - Not keen on it. - He's a Henry too. Doesn't mean I wanna cook for him. Sit up straight. You look like a thug in a pool hall. What if I do? What's it to you? - Excuse me? - Okay, all right, Chris. Sit up. - I haven't done anything. - I know. Let's just have a nice meal. She's the one who made me sit in the car for an hour with a smoker. - Smell my shirt. - What smoker? O'Casey. He smokes like a chimney. Christopher: And he keeps the windows up. Olive: We took Kevin Coulson home. Rachel's not leaving the house again. You have to watch what you give her, Henry. Believe me, Olive, I am. - Give her what? - Never mind, son. You can talk in front of me. I know Kevin's mom's a whack job. - You are done here. - Why? You do not call people whack jobs. - You say it all the time. - [Chuckles] Rachel Coulson has depression. Do you know what that is? - No. Not really. - You should. - It runs in our family. - No, it doesn't. Henry, are you nuts? What do you think was going on with my father? - That was a different thing. - No, it wasn't. - My mother had it too. - Well, not in the same way. I mean, she had her moods... She was clinical, Henry. Christopher: What's depression? It's bad wiring, makes your nerves raw. Is that why you're so mean all the time? Absolutely. Your mother is not depressed. Yes, I am. Happy to have it. Goes with being smart. - All right, Olive. - We might as well discuss it, Henry. He might have it too. But you don't think I'm smart. - Of course I do. - No, you don't. You think I'm average. You are plenty complicated, Christopher. Average is someone like Denise the mouse. [Scoffs] Henry: For God's sake... Nothing wrong with that. Average people are happier, happy, happy, happy. You should try it sometime, Ollie. I can't, I'm too depressed. [Laughs] [Ship horn blares in distance] - Good morning. - Good morning. Jim. [Car doors slam] - There you go. - Thank you so much. You're welcome. Here, let me show you out. Come on. Have a good day, Mrs. Merriman. Thank you. You too. Bye-bye. - Henry: Bye, watch your step. - Mrs. Merriman: Thank you. - Oh, Henry, guess what? - What? Denise: Jerry has some news to tell you. - Not a big deal. - Oh, yes, it is. Jerry's been taking a night class in business. - And he got an "A" on his test. - Oh, that's wonderful, Jerry. I went to mass and prayed that I'd pass. Well, I think you passed because you studied hard. Oh, but I believe in prayer. Do you pray a lot, Jerry? - I sure will now. - [Laughs] Oh, I gotta get going. I got another delivery. Oh, of course, off you go. Thank you for your help, Jerry. Yeah, sure. Bye. You're a very good influence on him. Oh, I'm just trying to get him to have a little bit more confidence in himself. You know, his mother used to call him a dimwit. - No. - Isn't that awful? Oh, that's not right. My mother used to call me her skinny pencil. [Laughs] Denise: I was, I guess. I eat like a bird. I think you're the perfect weight. Oh. Thank you. Henry doesn't have an ounce of fat on him. He's all muscle. He was a football star. - He was? - Yeah. The cheerleaders had a cheer just for him. Let's go, Thibodeau! - Let's... go! - [Laughs] Every time. - How do you like that? - Yeah. Henry: Oh, my goodness. - That must have been something, huh? - Oh, he was. Why he ever chose me... Oh! Oh, no! No, none of that. Henry: Stop it. - Lucky to have you. - Oh... - You know what we did last night? - What? Henry and I drove out to his parents' farm and we dug potatoes. - Did you? - Yeah. Henry put the lights on in his truck so we could see, and we were all out there with our spades, seeing what we could find. It was like an Easter egg hunt. - That's wonderful. - Then when I got cold, Henry put me in his truck so I could warm up. And every time he found a potato, he'd hold it up for me to see. [Laughs] Denise: And I kept thinking to myself, "This is all too good to be true." "I don't deserve this." Of course you do. Well, I was always told not to expect too much. Well, whoever told you that was wrong. No, you... you're gonna have many years of happiness to come. You enjoy it, Denise. Thank you. Yeah. I will. You know, I think it's about time for you and Henry - to come over for dinner. - Oh, well, we'd love that. - But we don't wanna put you out. - No, not at all. Olive would be delighted. Oh, there you are. Oh, I'm so glad you could make it. - Hello there, Henry. - Henry, hello. Henry brought you some of his firewood. - Here you go. - Oh, super. We were gonna bring you flowers, but we thought you'd like this better. - Oh, yeah. - Henry's wood burns like heaven. It'll make the warmest fires you'll ever see. Henry K.: Yeah. Olive: You don't see warmth, you feel it, dear. Oh, gosh, I guess you're right. Yeah, we all know what you mean. Come in, you two. Come on in. Thank you. You, uh, you have a nice piece of land here. Henry K.: Well, there are two lots, actually. And we're planning to build on the other parcel, if Christopher decides to stay. We'll have a house by the bay. Denise: Aw, isn't that neat? Christopher, do you like to go out on the water? Christopher, answer, please. No, not really. - May I be excused? - Go. Olive: Rinse your plate, please. Chris. Oh! Olive: Henry, leave it. Olive: For God's sake. [Clears throat] Henry K.: So, Henry, what are your plans for the weekend? Uh, me and my buddy Tony are going hunting. It's off-season, isn't it? Yeah, but Tony got us a special license. He got this farmer to sign a thing saying the deer were eating his crops. Oh. It's not really fair for the poor, little deer. Deer are pests. They're garden-killers. Do you hunt, Henry? Um, my father used to take me hunting. - Henry K.: I was good at tracking. - Henry T.: Oh, yeah? - Henry K.: Yeah. - Henry T.: Tracking's the hardest part. Yeah, you gotta... you gotta learn to think like a buck. - [Denise chuckles] - Henry K.: Yeah, their main objective, of course, is to find a fertile doe. And so I used to be able to smell the droppings and I could tell you if a deer was in heat. - You never told me that. - Yeah, it's true. Denise: Honey, can you do that? Smell a deer in heat? No. No, I usually just track by sight. Well, my Henry has eyes like a hawk. And apparently my Henry has a nose like a wolf. - [Laughter] - Henry K.: Yeah. Henry T.: Oh, Henry, why don't you come hunt with us. Tony's an easygoing guy. I'm sure he'd be glad to have you along. I haven't shot a gun in years. I'd be so rusty... Henry T.: Oh, that's all right, Tony's an awful shot, huh? Tony only hunts to get away from his wife, right? Yeah, well, she's a nagger. Denise: She only nags because he still acts like a teenager. I never have to nag at you, honey, because you're a grownup. - Hey, not always. - [Laughs] I like to get a little crazy once in a while. Yeah, but when you do, it's so cute. [Laughs] He likes to dance in his underwear. [Laughs] Hey! A fellow needs to let go every once in a while. Huh? - Henry T.: Mm! - [Denise laughs] Denise: Henry, what do you do to let go? Hops trains. Really? Olive: Yeah. He disappears for weeks, comes back filthy dirty. I have to strip off his clothes and scrub him down. Denise: Oh, my gosh. - She's playing with you, Denise. - Oh. [Laughs] [Denise, Henry T. chuckle] Can I help you, Mrs. Kitteridge? Olive: Sure. Henry T.: Thank you. [Henry, Olive moaning] [Bed creaking] [Moaning continues] [Laughs] [Panting] Oh... My goodness. So I say to Marlene, "if you think I don't do enough, then make me a list, 'cause, frankly, I don't got a fucking clue what you want from me." And she starts to cry, and says she's pregnant. I said, "Are you sure?" She says, "I might be," which, of course, she's not. She just does this to test me. Tony, will you shut up? You're gonna scare off the deer. Yeah, okay. Uh, here we go. Did you find something, Henry? Yeah, fresh scat. [Sniffing] Oh, I'd say that's from a rabbit. - Oh. - [Henry T. chuckles] Oh, yeah. ♪ All right. You two take this spot. - I'm gonna go check out that other trail. - Okay. ♪ Oh! [Exhales] [Insects chirping] [Birds chirping] [Branch cracks] [Henry T. yells] - Jesus! - Oh, my fucking God. - Come on! - Oh, no! Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Henry, you okay? I felt something here. All right, let me look. Let me look. God! Jesus almighty! Go get help. Oh, Jesus! Go get help! Go! - [Moaning] - No, no, no! Shh, shh. Be calm. Just be calm. Okay. All right, just be still. - Don't move. - [Moaning] Keep your eyes open. Look at me. Look at me. Keep your eyes open. Tell Denise... [Panting] - Yeah? - The oil in the truck needs to be changed. Okay. Shh... Stay with me. Come on, stay with me here. Oh, Henry. Stay... Henry? Stay with me, buddy. Henry? Oh, my God. Oh... Oh, sweet God. [Panting] Oh, my God. Oh... [Indistinct chatter] Here, sweetheart. Denise: His last words to me were so ordinary. Why would he wanna talk about his truck if he knew he was dying? He was in shock, Denise. He didn't know what he was saying. Denise: But still, wouldn't he want me to know that he loved me? If you need proof that you were loved, then... you are in for one big, fat disappointment. Oh! Well, gosh. [Laughs] Mrs. Kitteridge, I guess you're right! [Laughing] I killed your only son. Hit me! I have nothing else to offer you. Do what you have to do. - Someone remove this man, please. - Get away from him! An eye for an eye! Hit me! - Get him away from me! - Come on! Hit me! I need to be punished! Man: Shut up, son. Shut up, son. Henry, take her somewhere. Come on, Denise. Denise, come on. [Denise sobbing] Shh, shh... Okay. All right. All right, all right.

I'm sorry I'm such a rotten mother. Maybe when the mouse gets her license, she can drive us both... - Enough! Olive, enough! - Oh, quit yelling. You think that makes you a man? How pathetic. You know what's pathetic? Your attitude. Don't you dare scold me. Where are you going? I'm gonna mow the lawn. [Door closes] Jesus, Ma. Oh, what's the problem? Morning, Jim. Henry. So how are Irene and the kids? Yeah, still filling the house with endless noise and mirth. [Chuckles] Uh, Irene stopped by the other day. I gave her something for Sean's cough. - Jim: Sean, the little one? - Henry: Yeah. Listen, um... Um... I think it'd be a good idea... if I took Olive and Chris to school. Yeah? Yeah, I think you're right. [Taps roof] [Engine starts] [Knocking on door] Just a second. - Tony's here. - Better be going. Mr. Mott will be in for his diuretic, you should remind him to eat a banana for potassium. I will. [Door opens] Hey, Mr. K. Hey, Denise. I have some news. - I got accepted into U. of M. - Oh, that's great news. Good for you, Jerry. - I'll be majoring in Business. - Terrific. Excuse me, Jerry. - I just thought I'd let you know. - No, that's great news, Jerry. See you later. Henry, I asked Tony to take me to my driver's test because I didn't want to keep imposing on you. It's no imposition. You should know that by now. Tony has been having a really hard time. He needs someone to talk to. Tony certainly didn't do your husband any favors, now, did he? [Sobs] Well, that was a horrible thing to say. - I don't want to fight with you. - I'm sorry, neither do I. It's been horrible not talking to you. Come here, you poor girl. - [Sobbing] - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I really do wish it was you who was taking me, Henry. - I know, I know. - I do! I know you do. [Both sigh] - Denise. - Yeah? You're gonna pass that driver's test with flying colors. Yeah, 'cause I have faith in you, Denise. I do. Oh, thank you, Henry. Thank you. [Laughs] - Thank you! Thank you! - [Laughing] - Off you go. - Okay! [Sighs] - [Bell jingles] - Go get 'em! Henry! Henry! I passed! Oh, I knew it! I... Oh, that's so marvelous, Denise! Hi! Whiskers and me are gonna drive to the Frosty Freeze - and have ourselves an ice cream! - You have a wonderful night. - You've earned it. - Thank you. - Drive carefully. - I will! I will! - Say bye-bye! Bye! - Bye, Whiskers. - [Laughs] Bye-bye! - Bye, Denise. [Laughs] Bye! - Did young miss pass her driving test? - Yes, she did. Mm-hmm. I expect you'll ask me to bake her a cake. I expect nothing, Ollie. - [Telephone rings] - [Henry clears throat] If that's a salesperson, hang the hell up. Hello, Kitteridge residence. Denise on phone: Henry! Oh, God! Denise? Denise, is that you? - Denise: Oh, God! - Henry: De... Denise? Is that... is that you? Hello? Denise: Whiskers got out, I was backing up the truck... I didn't see him! - Oh, God! - Oh, oh... Henry: Stay where you are. I'll be right over. Okay. Shh, shh, shh. Okay. Shh. Shh, shh, I'll be right over. I'll be right over. [Sighs] What's going on? [Sighs] Denise ran over her cat. [Laughs] Oh, Jesus. Go, Henry, go. Go over and comfort your girlfriend. Henry: Oh, stop it. That's unnecessary. She's a young widow who ran over her cat. Where in God's name's your compassion? She wouldn't have run over any goddamn cat if you hadn't given it to her. Here. This will help you sleep. [Sighs] I talk to you in my head all the time. I'm sorry. - For what? - For talking to you in my head. No, no, no. Mm-mmm. What's going to become of me, Henry? I'm gonna take care of you, Denise.
