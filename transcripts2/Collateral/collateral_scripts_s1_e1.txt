 No. Not this time. It was Mikey's. And now it's yours. Can I have a chicken special, please? 12-inch chicken special. I'm still waiting on the Caribbean, get off the phone and get moving, please! PHONE RINGS Who is it? Pizza. DOOR BUZZES BABY CRIES I paid on the phone. Wait a mo. No special topping? Oh, forget it. Thanks very much. BABY CONTINUES CRYING DOOR BUZZES GUNSHOTS

 BABY CRIES DOOR OPENS God, I'm a mess. PHONE RINGS Yep. OK. Is this a case? It's a murder. Are you sure it's a good idea? Yeah, I want to do this one. Good luck. RADIO CHATTER SIREN SWITCHES ON Is that it? Don't say it's still open. Turn around. What the hell is this? You're still serving?! I've got your margherita there for you, mate, OK. What are you doing? Close the place down. I've got targets to meet. Yeah, so do we. Where's my pizza?! It's coming. No, you're not! No-one's getting their pizza, are they? Cos you're shutting down. Excuse me. Close the place down. What? Where's my pizza? Did you see anything? He gave us our pizza. And then I closed the door. Then we heard gunfire out in the street. Maybe, 30 seconds later. How did you know it was gunfire? Because I was brought up in Beirut. OK. You were alone? Yeah. With the children. She fell asleep afterwards. I think she had a reaction. Reaction? To what happened. I think it was fear. When did you order? Erm, 9.30pm. We have a pizza every Monday. At the same time? Yep. By phone? What did you order? Quatro formaggio. It's her favourite. Elfie. Isn't that a bit late? How old is she? Seven. Elfie's on her own clock. You said "children". Yeah, yeah. How many? Two. Tell me your second child's name. Lucy. But she doesn't come into it. She's a baby. SIREN WAILS OUTSIDE SIREN STOPS You threw it in the corner, the pizza? SHE LAUGHS You live by yourselves? Apart from the au pair, who's not here. You're not married? I don't understand, I just ordered a pizza, my marital status has nothing to do with it. All right, if you have to know, the baby's not my husband's. Are you arresting me for that? Did the pizza man say anything? Apart from thank you when I gave him the tip, no, nothing at all. Thank you? Yeah. That's all? Then he went. Do you have the receipt? Did you pay cash? I don't have cash. I didn't have cash. I paid over the phone. SHE CLEARS HER THROAT SIREN WAILS We've got to sort this out. We can't go on like this. I know. We've been on three dates. The first one, we never even made it to bed, you had to take a call from your leader. Tell me about it. And then tonight, like the last time, I'm sitting in a restaurant, eating fucking breadsticks. You don't even call me. I tried. The reception's terrible. Look, David, you just have to decide what you want. Has it never occurred to you that Labour may not even get back? That there might not be another Labour government? DOOR CLOSES I don't understand. You're going to have to ask me again. What I'm saying, I thought there was a rota. Sort of a rota. Meaning what exactly? People take turns. So it was Mikey's turn? Yeah. In fact, you'd already told him, you go to Bramham Gardens with a quattro formaggio. Yeah. So why did you decide not to send him? I changed my mind. I sent Abdullah. I can do what I want. I know. I am in charge. I understand that. My question is, why did you do it? Why? Abdullah was killed delivering a pizza. I don't know anything about that. I'm not saying you do. I'm not accusing you of murder. However, the murderer was waiting. Why didn't you send Mikey? I'm asking, is the system random? How could a gunman know who he was going to kill? And if he wanted to kill anyone in particular, was it just chance that you changed your mind? Well? I don't know. Did you see anyone outside? Anyone following him? No. Was there a reason? Was there a reason that you sent Abdullah? He hadn't had a run all night. Abdullah hadn't had a run all night. So you felt sorry for him? Yeah. You sent him out of the goodness of your heart? Who owns this place? I manage it. I know that. The owner changed. When? Last month. I've never even spoken to him. They're in Boca Raton. Right. So this is a south London pizza parlour owned by a man in Boca Raton? Yeah. This is Mikey Gowans. Yeah, we met. Mikey's just realised it might have been him. Mikey, you're going to have to tell us why anyone might want to kill you. Look, it doesn't make any sense. Are you sure about that? Did you know Abdullah? Not really. Did you know his second name? He'd just started. I think, erm... I think he was Syrian or something. Syrian? Mm, that's what he said. How do you get paid? By the delivery. Cash? Yeah. Any paperwork? It's not a paperwork kind of place. What did you do before? I was a bouncer. In a night-club. Till I got hit. Which night-club? The Turbine. Then I'm not surprised you got hit. Rakhee, take Mr Gowans back to the station? I'm going to the scene. Can I say something? Yeah, you can say whatever you like. The system is the system. Disliking it isn't going to change it. It carries on, regardless of what you feel about it. And what has that got to do with my being late for a date? You know, you're a really nice man, David, but you are so lost in things that you can't do anything about. You no longer have any idea who you actually are. Where are you going? Just stay. No. I can't stay here. Come on, you'll feel differently in the morning. I don't think so. Well, at least let me order you a cab. Oh, for fuck's sake. Look, if the Labour Party makes you angry, what do you think it does to me? It makes you boring. DOOR OPENS DOOR CLOSES SIREN WAILS SIREN WAILS IN THE DISTANCE SHE CLEARS HER THROAT Nathan, OK? Are you making any sense of this? I don't get it. There's no way a gunman can know which delivery person's coming. What do you think it is? Random shooter? Does it for the hell of it? I don't think so. What, then? Why would anyone kill a pizza-delivery man? Well, have you ever eaten their pizza? Amusing. Something else odd. What? So, you know I spoke to Karen Mars, the woman who ordered the pizza? Well? She talked about her baby. She said "Oh, she doesn't come into it." So? "She doesn't come into it" - what does she mean by that? What did she mean by it? Probably like how a pizza delivery man was just murdered outside her door, and, as a mother, she feels her baby was not involved. That's probably what she meant. "She doesn't come into it" - it's an odd way to put it. Evening Standard. Yeah, we know that. I got here before you. Congratulations. Can I get past the tape, then? What, so the Evening Standard can fuck up the scene? It's a Muslim killing, right? No, it's a killing. But the victim was a Muslim? I know what the press want to make of this. What, a mind-reader, are you? No, a newspaper reader. Why didn't they kill him on the way in? Why did they wait till he was on his way out? I'm just saying, they could've killed him five minutes earlier. You need to go on a communications course. Why? That's not how to handle public relations. They write what they want. Do you think being nice to them makes any difference? It's true what he's saying, though. Why wait? It means we've got a calm killer. Semi-automatic. Two rounds of two. Each time with perfect accuracy at 20 yards. We're thinking a professional? Maybe a robbery gone wrong. Robbing what? Pizza drivers are the most-robbed people in London, do you know that? What about drugs? You tell me. There was a witness in the street but a long way away. Is that her? Hanh Giang. Make of her what you can. She was in a K-hole. Where had she been? She says taking a walk. We asked her to turn out her pockets. Is that all she had? It's enough. Does she have a description? Thin. Average height. She only saw him for a second, she said his face was obscured. Obscured by? She says a diving suit. How stoned was she? More likely some sort of balaclava. What she saw was the hood. Round his face. Have a look at this gate. Good chance our killer went over there. Any footprints? No, nothing. Who's the SIO? Kip Glaspie. I'm the new area forensic manager. My name's Gupta. People call me Fuzz. I don't think this scene's going to make you happy. Really? Why not? The witness saw something. Sounds like the guy may have been wearing rubber. He's a professional, then? Never mind. Every contact leaves a trace. Can I ask you a question? Sure. Weren't you an athlete? Didn't you do pole vault or something? Yeah. I jumped for a while. Wasn't there some kind of famous incident? Yeah. She landed badly. Still. Kip Glaspie. Pretty impressive. You're Hanh Giang? Yeah. Where did you get this? Er, I went to a club. Do you have any ID? Er, not on me, no. Do you have any at home? Yeah. Where's home? Er...Stockwell Park Road. OK, someone's going to take you down there in a few moments, OK? As far as we can tell, you're the sole witness to a murder. When your brain is functioning again, think back. Think about if there's anything that you might have overlooked. Can you do that? Yeah. OK. Come in first thing tomorrow morning. Thank you. Abdullah's phone. Tell me. I went into "frequent locations". I'm thinking if that's work, that's home. Let's go. "Dear David... "I think it's easier for me to write an old-fashioned, proper letter, "because when I'm with you I never seem able to say what I mean. "It comes out cruel, and that's not what I want. "You've had so many failed relationships, you don't believe "that anyone could possibly find you worth the effort. "But believe it or not, I do. "That's why I get so angry. "Because if you just stopped for five minutes, "there's something I can see and you can't - "the truth is, you're a very good soul." David! What are you doing here? Well, it's my constituency, Rob. Is that the only reason? What do you know? They're saying it's a hate crime. Immigrant shot in the street. I'd love a quote if you can give me one. David Mars. Is everything all right? What happened? Sorry. I didn't mean to call. I got frightened, that's all. I don't understand. Well, I won't say it again. It was me who ordered the pizza. Did you hear the shot? Of course I heard it. Quite like old times. You were the last person to speak to him? Well, I suppose. I don't get it, you don't seem very upset. I thought I had a bottle of wine. I must have drunk it. Is that a new shirt? You called me to come over here. Sorry if that was a drag! I'm sure you're busy. Don't worry about it. Too busy for the mother of your child. Karen, you know that is not fair. I know what you're thinking - I was only married to her for three months, am I going to have to look after her for the rest of my life? Four. Four months. Well, the answer is yes. Yes, for the rest of your life. Get used to it. HE SIGHS What's that? This is a letter somebody wrote to me. You mean, as in the 19th century, that kind of letter? Don't politicians have e-mail? Well, you seem in good shape. All things considered. You've had a shock. Well, that's why I called you, David. Do you mind staying over? For Elfie's sake? Don't look at me like that. You chose this job. You could have done anything. I was a teacher. I gave it up, remember? Why? Too violent. HE CHUCKLES Home? Do you want me to do it? No. I'm good. We're from the police. Can you tell me your names? Do either of you speak English? We were just called to a situation not far from here. Do either of you know Abdullah Asif? I'm going to assume you understand a little, while we get someone here to help. As I said, we were just called to an incident nearby, where a male has been shot in the chest. We believe it to be Abdullah Asif. You shared a space with him so we're going to need to see your paperwork, whatever you've got, any documents you happen to have - it doesn't matter what they are, what language. I'm going to get an interpreter and we're going to ask you some questions. We're here to help. For now, all I can say is sorry. That's how it ends up, is it? Escape war, make your way to England and start your new life in a garage? That's the best we can offer, is it? Well, we've seen it before. Yeah, we've seen it before - doesn't make it better, though, does it? No views? Oh, yeah, I've got a view, two hours in and things are already out of control. What are you getting? At first glance, absolutely nothing. Footprints? I knew the moment I came. You can always tell. It's a set up. Look... Perfect place to hide, perfect darkness, giving him a perfect view across the street, perfect getaway. They want it to look random but it isn't - there's nothing random about it. First thing tomorrow. Yeah. Thank you. Where have you been? I was out. It's three o'clock in the morning. Were you with someone else? I want you to tell me. Honestly. I... I'd rather know the truth. I wasn't with anyone! Then what were you doing? I'm not gonna tell you if you're going to get angry. I won't get angry. Even if... Look, you're free. You can do what you want. Of course you can. I wanted to get high. And did you? Yeah. I needed some air. I need some space. You can be so clingy. Linh, you're much the best thing in my life. SHE SIGHS HEAVILY Something's happened. Just tell me what's happened. I went to a club. Which club? I can guess. And then I walk home and I felt quite weird. So I sit down on the pavement and I don't know how long I'm there. And? Someone got shot dead, across the street. A pizza man. Fuck! And then the police arrive. I was frightened, I panicked and... You spoke to them? Yeah. They emptied my pocket. And what did they find? Ketamine. MDMA. I was scared. I panicked. But I didn't give them my real name. You made up a name? Yeah, and address. Why did you do that? Why do you think? If they know who I am, I'm in trouble. I panic. I was terrified. I don't want to go home. I want to live in England. I know. People do. Also, there's something else. Something I didn't dare tell them, cos... Cos I was off my head. I told them the killer had a hood on. And that was true? Yeah. But what I didn't say is, er... ..I thought it was a woman. They're terrified. I'm sorry to ask this but how do we know they're his sisters? They've got no papers. They're paperless. Why would they lie? All right, why would they lie about that? They must have money. They did. Abdullah Asif had a driving licence, remember? Well, he must have paid for that. Syrian refugee. English driving licence. That's not cheap. Provisional. How long have they been here? She doesn't want to say. Well, she's going to have to. SHE SPEAKS ARABIC THEY SPEAK ARABIC She doesn't know. Of course you know. Think of it her way. Her brother's just been killed. She doesn't know who to trust. Look, can you tell her we understand she's in grief, but she has to stop fucking about and tell us the truth? Whatever that is in Arabic. TRANSLATOR SPEAKS ARABIC WOMAN RESPONDS IN ARABIC Maybe weeks. Do you have a job? THEY SPEAK ARABIC She works in a hotel. Where? TRANSLATOR SPEAKS ARABIC SHE RESPONDS IN ARABIC She can't say. It's dangerous for her. What, they don't pay the National Minimum Wage? Tell her there's a reason for what happened and we need to find that reason. If this woman is remotely serious, she has to help us. Has to. SHE SPEAKS ARABIC She says she fears this is going to have a bad outcome. How can it have a worse outcome? Her brother is dead. So, did it work? Women only. Stuff pour out of them, did it? Not much. In the all-female environment? What we did discover - turns out they lived in Aleppo. They worked in a tourist hotel. In Aleppo? Well, that's a triumph. Sure. Before it was destroyed. Abdullah was on reception. They feared for their lives in Syria. The war is never going to end. Assad's a ruthless dictator who'd rather see his country destroyed than yield power. That's their view, is it? It's Fatima's. Mona's not speaking. Nothing? Not a word. They're what our leaders call genuine asylum seekers. They had to get out or they'd be killed. So she'll give us her political views, but she won't actually give us any names, like who got her here, how her brother found his job. Why not? Because they're frightened. What, frightened of us? No. More like one of them's been killed and they're asking who's next. They don't feel safe. You should go back to the station with them. We're going to need you later. OK. What do you want to do now? Can we just think this thing through? Please. Can we? Like normally how you have a body and then you work out who they are and who might want to kill them. Yeah? That's the procedure? If you say so. Only as I understand it - let me know if I'm going too fast for you - this time we don't know who's meant to have been killed. Yeah, I'm onto that. So working out why seems more than normally difficult. That's very good. You've got your speech ready for the superintendent. Anything to add? Nothing. You? Yeah. There's nobody here. Nobody except us. Why would there be? Because these people are Syrian. So? They're Syrian. What I'm asking - where's MI5? Where's counter-terrorism? Where are they? Yeah. Anything of this nature from the region, they're like flies round dead meat. Why aren't they here? My guess is they're still in bed. OK, it seems we're finished with you. Do you want to go? I can't sleep here? It's not a hotel. I'm just a bit shaky, that's all. I'd got to know Abdullah a bit. And? He was a decent bloke, I liked him. And? That's what I wanted to say. DOOR BUZZES Well, you've said it. Yeah, I guess I have. We're privileged to have the Leader of the Opposition, Deborah Clifford, here in the studio. Good morning, Suki. Obviously, you're aware that seven immigration bills in the last eight years, 45,000 changes to those immigration rules since 2010. That's right. And Labour has opposed many of those changes. We support control of our borders and we always have. We've been very clear about that. Well, nevertheless, these days, you seem to be taking a different approach. Well, sometimes, in the past, Labour's given an impression of caring more for newcomers than for the resident population. That was wrong. You regret that? Look, Suki, my grandparents were immigrants, immigrants have done this country a lot of good. But we also believe in a proper control of numbers. This seems to be part of a whole shift from Labour, though, on all sorts of things - nuclear weapons, human rights, prisons. On Thursday, the Labour party's got a big vote, in support of the government's new surveillance measures which many people see as a real threat to freedom. That's an exaggeration, if you don't mind me saying so. Oh, for fuck's sake! Hi, Dad. Hello, beautiful. Where's your mother? Is she getting up? Isn't she going to work? She lost her job. OK. How did she lose it? Was she fired? When did that happen? Last week. Come on, let's get you something to eat. Mum says you run the country. Well, that's not quite true, actually. I'm in something called Opposition. Which means moaning about the people who run the country. I'm with Mum all the time. I know you are. She's really difficult. Well, your mother's a difficult woman, that's just a fact. I think she doesn't like me. She loves you, sweetpea, we both do. Come here. There. Well... So, tell me, what's the view from the cheap seats? We're just putting it together. How long's that going to take? We're just gathering facts. If you see something we're missing, give us a shout. Not on the face of it. Do you want coffee? It's proper. No, thank you. You on an all-nighter? Well, you know the drill. Detention's been out-sourced, it's now in the hands of our privatised colleagues. I've had to report the Asif family as illegals. They've only just begun to tell us what they know. Yeah, well, look at it from their point of view. There's not much profit in going into detail about how they got here. Why take the risk? We're finding that already. The younger one doesn't talk at all. I'm wondering if she's pregnant. Really? Well, you'd know. Have you asked? Anything we get has to be dragged out of them. They just don't want to talk. That's it, isn't it? We don't have any leverage. How do we get some? I've already had a morning call from Millbank. I was wondering when that was coming. Rubber balaclava, professional marksman, asylum seeker. It's MI5 country, isn't it? No doubt they'll turn up and give us some professional advice. MI5'll come and patronise the country cousins, tell us how useless we are. That's how it usually works with the security services. Do they know Abdullah Asif already? If they do, they're not telling us. With MI5, it's always one way. They want your information, but they don't want to give up any of theirs. Yeah, I've met people like that. Karen! Karen! What's happening? You said you were taking Elfie to school! I am. Well, you're late. What day is it? Tuesday. To take her to school, you have to get up! Where's David? He's gone. Now you still have to get up to look after Lucy. Oh, fuck off! Grrr! Who's taking me to school? I don't know. Mind your own business. Now get down and get dressed and get a move on. I don't have to do everything, do I? Is Mummy getting up? I have no idea. KNOCK AT DOOR This had better be important. It is important. I've had a hell of a night. Me too. Is Linh still with you? Why wouldn't she be? Is the bishop going to get rid of you? He's going to try. Isn't he a bit of an LGBT himself? He has a boyfriend who runs a sauna in Brixton, if that's what you mean. But the difference is he's not out and I am. ON TV: Perhaps we should ask ourselves whether the vicious rhetoric that's used against people who come here legitimately to seek asylum encourages exactly this kind of violence. There are too many people who believe that hate speech doesn't have... Do you know you come across as a bit of a tosser? Now we... SHE SWITCHES TV OFF Are you doing any work on that? What did you need me for? I've got a dilemma. Linh was witness to the murder. Linh was? Yes. The only witness. I'm assuming she talked to the police? Sure. But the problem is she was high. And they found the gear on her. That's more serious. They've asked her to go to the police station this morning. Well, I hope she's going to. She's scared. Last night she gave a false name. Well, that was a pretty stupid thing to do. She was trying to protect me, David. I'm out on a limb here. Also, ah, you'd better speak to her in person. Because you helped her. You signed her application for a student visa. I was happy to. She respects you. Jane, there's something you're not telling me. Because I... I don't know how to say this. Say it. I love this girl and I don't want to lose her. Christ. Please don't use that word. I love swearing, I hate blasphemy. I really hate it. If that makes me a fucking hypocrite, so be it. Do you love her more than me? You were an episode. She's a whole chapter. Or she was going to be. David. Linh. Er, Jane thought you might have a minute for a chat. Er, yeah. Jane told me what happened. You've got no choice, you have to go into the station. Not going in will only make matters worse. Yeah, I know. And Jane says you have vital evidence. You thought it was a woman. You've got to tell them that. There is one other thing, David. Tell me. Well, you remember you signed her application? To renew her student visa. I do. Are you still at that stupid college? Sometimes. Oh, only sometimes? It's a legitimate place of education, David, it's approved by the DoE. Oh, well, in that case, that's a stamp of excellence. What's it called, Kennington Poly? But what we didn't tell you, er, when I asked you to sign... Her first student visa had already expired. What? Hang on. I didn't think to mention it. You mean she's here illegally? It's a grey area. Jane, I'm a fucking MP. I signed. You didn't sign it knowingly. No! Because you didn't tell me! Well, we're telling you now. Oh, thank you VERY much! Fuck! Jane! How could you do that!? You see, that's why it's difficult. You see why she doesn't want to talk to the police? Ugh. Give that a look over, will you? Do you want to slip home? I can take over for a while. Bit late for that, isn't it? Where are you off to? I thought, one more word with our friends. Look, I don't have any say in the matter. You may well be detained. After that, you may be sent home. You should take the chance to talk, right now, today. TRANSLATOR SPEAKS ARABIC I'm interested, for instance, about your transport, through Turkey from Syria, a boat to Greece, a lorry through Europe, then through the tunnel. How long did it take? TRANSLATOR REPEATS IN ARABIC SHE REPLIES Under a month. That's impressively quick. What are we dealing with, club class? TRANSLATOR SPEAKS ARABIC WOMAN RESPONDS She says that's all she knows. Murder cases can get bogged down. Bogged down in bureaucracy as much as anything. That's just a fact. TRANSLATOR SPEAKS People lose sight of the victims. And in this case, you're among the victims. You should make use of a sympathetic ear whilst you've got it. TRANSLATOR SPEAKS Well? Mikey, haven't seen you for a while. No. But I wanted to warn you, yeah? The... The police are all over us. Yeah, but have you got what we want? Not yet. Why don't we go round the back? I don't want to go round the back. Come on. Please. Come on. Come on. I have to go out for a bit, Mum. I'm leaving you water. The council'll be around in an hour. Mum. Mm. You are a good girl. Yeah, I wish. I wouldn't be alive without you! I'll see you later, all right? Bye, love. Hut! MAN SHOUTS OUT COMMANDS Right...turn! Left...turn!
