 This programme contains some scenes which some viewers may find upsetting and strong language MUSIC PLAYS: Big Yellow Taxi by Joni Mitchell # They paved paradise And put up a parking lot # With a pink hotel, a boutique And a swinging hot spot # Don't it always seem to go # That you don't know what you've got till it's gone # They paved paradise And put up a parking lot # Shoo-ba-ba-ba-ba # Shoo-ba-ba-ba-ba # They took all the trees And put 'em in a tree museum # And they charged the people A dollar and a half to see 'em

 # Don't it always seem to go... # Come on. Quickly. I don't understand. Where are we? You're in Harlsfleet, darling. Are we in prison? Hardly. Bags! Don't worry. You can pick them up the other side. Are you a guard? We're not guards, we're custody officers. Come on. Come on! BUZZER You've everything you need. No locks on the doors.

 The bathroom's down the corridor that way. You'll be processed later. The legal aid solicitor comes in twice a week. How long will we be here for? Ah, well, if we knew that! No-one in this place knows when they're getting their ticket. Ticket? Airline ticket. To send you home. Right, if you want to clean yourselves up, we'll see you in a couple of minutes. My brother was murdered. I need to find out what's happening. Yeah, I'm sure there'll be somebody to help you with that. Captain Shaw. BELL TOLLS Ah, there you are. Safely returned to us. I'm sorry, sir? I wondered where you were, Captain. I was on leave, sir. I know. It was a leave. I was due leave. We've missed you. Welcome back. It's started again. You should do something about it. Make a complaint. What for? You know what for. He's smirking. Exactly. I go to the CO and say, "The Regimental Second-in-Command's "always looking at my arse when I walk out the room?" I just don't see why we should have to put up with it. You know the answer. Because this is the Army? SOLDIERS PERFORM DRILL You fell asleep, didn't you? Did I? You should have gone home. Maybe. I started thinking about those two sisters. What bothers me - they weren't surprised. When their brother was killed. Maybe they were expecting it. Where are they now? In the hotel. Wake them up and let's start again. HE UNLOCKS DOOR What happened to you? What, me? Yeah. Oh, this. I fell over. Where? At home. Where's home? I'm staying with a mate at the moment. I'd had a bit of a drink. I got up in the night for a piss. I'm looking for Laurie. She's not coming in. Where is she? I don't know. Well, have you heard from her? Well, she rang me and asked me to fire up the oven. I wonder, have you got the credit card slips? Yeah, sure. From last night. They're here. You got nothing for Mars? Karen Mars? I don't know. You'd have to ask Laurie. So it's just Mrs Mars said she'd paid in advance. Yeah, it's possible. If it's all right, I'm going to take these. CAR ENGINE IDLES CHURCH BELL TOLLS You're Laurie, aren't you? I'm wondering if I can be any help. No. I just stopped by. Is that all right? Of course it's all right, it's a church. I've seen you here before, with your mother. The lady with the oxygen. We shop around. We go to the Catholic as well. Good. Our church says there's no one truth. Actually... ..I wouldn't mind talking. Come in. This is my friend Linh. This is Laurie. Hi. Linh helps us out with the homeless, so she's always in a rush. Sit down, please. You're still here. You really need to go in and speak to the police. You have to do what David told you. Well, can't you get David to speak to them first? I've got a home visit and then I'll come back and find you. It was nice to meet you. I'll make tea. I'm sorry, I feel like I'm taking up your time. SHE LIGHTS GAS Oh, it's no problem. Are you having a thing with her? What makes you ask? Picked up on a vibe. Do you have a problem with that? Sorry. It was wrong of me to ask. It's been a struggle. The authorities are cracking down on foreign students. I'm surprised. I mean, that the church doesn't mind. And you? No. Nothing in that department. My mother's my life. I look after her. She's dying. She hasn't got anyone else. The council come in, but you can't depend on them. They don't have the people. They don't have the money. Same thing. Erm, where do you work? Regal Pizza. I'm the manager. Strange. Linh saw the murder. KETTLE STARTS TO WHISTLE She saw the actual shooting? She was out in the street. Is it the killing that's upset you? Is that why you're here? Tell me. It's hardly your fault. Do you have an idea of him? You mean God? Yeah. I prefer to say her, but him if you insist. Very clear idea. You? I woke up this morning and I thought I'd just get out. Escape. But if I do that, I'll just feel guilty. Perhaps that is why I use the Catholic more often. They are better on guilt. Laurie, what did you do? I sent a man to his death. It was me that sent him out. Not knowingly. Did you? I sent him. Laurie, did you know? Well, then. There's knowing and knowing. There's...feeling. CHURCH BELL TOLLS I'm going to have to make my visit. I'd like to feel you'll stay here if you want. I'm not going to be long, and you're very welcome. Thank you. Good. SHE PICKS UP KEYS See you later, OK? Oh, fuck. This isn't going to work. What isn't? Avoiding Deborah. Her office is going nuts. Oh, well, if it's just her office. It isn't. It's herself in person. Gosh, you spoke to the leader! And that breakfast television woman called you. Really? What does she want? Bit out of your class, isn't she? I'm not going to tell you. Remember, information is power. And The Standard wants a comment. On what? On your dead Syrian. You need to reassure the public. Reassure them about what? That the killer's going to be found. What am I, Sherlock Holmes now? You're not saying you're going to find him. Listen, people have a higher chance of catching malaria than they do of being shot dead by a killer in a rubber balaclava. Rubber? How do you know that? Because I happen to be a very good constituency MP. I have to say something to Deborah. Why? She thinks you're planning to break ranks in the surveillance vote on Thursday. Where on earth did she get that idea? David, I can't hold her off for much longer. I'm sure you will lie beautifully. Oh, by the way... Yes? Can you please find the detective in charge of this case? Why? I just told you - information is power. PHONE RINGS David Mars' office. ..No, I haven't seen him, he isn't in yet. Of course, I'll let you know when he is. For fuck's sake! I don't believe this. How the hell did this happen? What's going on? Only now they've taken our witnesses away. Who? Fucking JDG, who else? What happened? We put them in a hotel for the morning, Border Force talks to JDG, JDG turns up, takes them away. Apparently their paperwork was perfect. It happens all the time. You have to admit it's kind of impressive. At least it's efficient. I suppose you know where Harlsfleet is. I do. Essex. Down the A12. 90 minutes in traffic. I can tell you right now, you're going to have to make an appointment. What? You have to call ahead. You have to have a letter of instruction. Signed. I thought we were the police. So to them, we're just one more agency. They're suspicious. They're suspicious of everyone. They think I have a hidden agenda? Works for Panorama, goes in with a camera in my fucking hat? KNOCK ON WINDOW I called by the pizza place on the way in. Oh, yeah? Laurie was due in for work but she hasn't appeared. Oh, one day after she sends a guy out to be killed and she's not there? That's what I'm saying. Is she at the dentist? Isn't that what we do now? Find her? You should get some sleep. I'm not going to sleep until we make some progress. Mm-hm. What? What?! Well, you may be awake for a very long time. What's this about? What's what about? Working through the night. Just because it's your first big case? Or trouble at home? It's just stupid, over-working. When it comes down to it, it's inefficient. This case means something to you, doesn't it? Are you going to say what? So you have to talk to me, Sandrine. If you don't, then you know the problem. I fail. I don't pass. It's not a test. Don't think of it like that. It's not a hurdle. It's a precaution. And it's in everybody's interest. You can't redeploy on operations and you certainly can't go back to Special Duties until I'm convinced you've put away the past. Yes. I know that. Well, I'm really feeling much better. Since? Since we started this process. It's helped. How's Regimental HQ? Good. You're comfortable there? Completely. No problems? None. I, erm, I want to hone in and talk about anger again. The notes from Camp Bloodhound say you arrived in Cyprus very, very angry. Not angry. When you came back from the tour? Straight after? No. Distressed. They specifically say angry. I felt responsible for what happened in Helmand. In particular? The Afghan women who were working for me. You get close to them. And losing your colleague? That too. Do you sleep? Perfectly. But it's about respect. Explain? My best friend was blown up in front of my eyes. Elizabeth? I picked up the pieces. Yes. Bits of her all over the ground. Bits on my kit, bits in my hair. Even when I cleaned my weapon, wiping bits off. I feel that if I forget her that would be disrespectful. You were fond of Elizabeth? Everyone was. It's...it's a balance, isn't it? Returning to normal life doesn't mean you're betraying the dead. Sometimes that's how it feels. And you see danger everywhere. You're trained for it. Everything makes you suspicious. You become like a...an animal. What do you play off? Sorry? Your handicap? Oh, erm... 17. HE CHUCKLES Why, do you play? I played with my dad. Well, perhaps we should play a round together. SHE CHUCKLES Take your mind off things. Perhaps. HE KNOCKS It's open. We're police. We're looking for Laurie Stone. TV AUDIO Are you her mother? I don't know where she is. I haven't seen her. Since when? Regal Pizza say she hasn't appeared for work. Well, she's not here. Do you have any idea where she might be? No. You have a choice. You can either let us look round the place, look through her stuff. Or we can come back later officially. How do you suggest I stop you? Kip! How much? It's about a thousand. So how long exactly since she left? She left as usual this morning. Did she? And did she say where she was going? I thought she was going to work. But then she rang me later and said not to worry. Have you seen this money before? Do you know why she might have had it? No! Why, does she usually have a lot of cash? Does anyone? I haven't seen that much in years. The point is this - there was a killing. Yeah. I heard about that. What did Laurie say about it? She was very upset. Nothing more than that? She made my breakfast early and then she went out. OK. We're going to keep in touch. And we'll send someone round to look after you. Are you going to take her money? As a matter of fact, we are. But she's going to get it back. My dad said never let the police in. They bring bad luck. Your dad was right. We do. Well? What do you think? Something's going on. A thousand pounds in a sock drawer seems strange to me. You don't kill someone for a grand. This postcode, killing's two grand at least. A thousand might be for helping to kill. The place was employing illegals. They paid everyone in cash. If you think about it, it's not surprising Laurie's doing a runner. But she didn't own it. No. She was just managing. And even that's a big word for it. All right, so she was caught in the middle. It was all going fine till it wasn't, sort of thing. Another way of looking at it - intentionally or not, she sent a man to his death and, hey, now no-one can find her. The two things have got to be connected. Karen Mars says she paid on the phone, but there's no record of any transaction. There's no credit card slip. So now we suspect mother of two Karen Mars, do we? Murderess, is she, because she didn't pay for her pizza? Well, no. Because she lies. And I suppose you think she's innocent because she's married to an MP. Not any more she isn't. That was years ago. Oh, flame gone out, has it? And have we found out who owns Regal Pizza? Yeah. A person in Boca Raton. And does this person have a name? Well, they have a registered office. So, no, we don't have a name? Meanwhile, I'm going to go check on Mikey Gowans. You do that. He's covered in bruises. He claims to have fallen over the crapper. And you don't believe him? Do you? And where the fuck is Boca Raton?! You're new. I saw you at roll-call. I don't understand. What is this place? Harlsfleet Removal Centre. It's meant to be detention, but it isn't. It's removal. When did you get here? I've been here two years. I've been living in England since I was three. My mother brought me here. She died. Now they've decided they don't like my paperwork. I'm what they call an over-stayer. By about 30 years. Is she all right? She's fine. Whatever you do, don't go to the clinic. Don't do anything medical. They're a different company, they're even worse. Still, it's better than getting your ticket. Every day you stay here, you win. SHE WHIMPERS TRAIN PASSES OVERHEAD SPEECH INAUDIBLE I'll fucking kill you. SPEECH INAUDIBLE We're in business. Now fuck off! Steady on there, mate. Sorry, mate. I'm just delivering a pizza. All right, straight in and out, yeah? Is that all right? BUZZER Oh, I see. Now I get it. You're getting what you didn't get last night, because Mikey didn't deliver? Am I right? Cash only? I wouldn't do that if I were you. And as for you, you're a fucking barefaced liar. Why didn't you tell me about this last night? This is nothing. It's recreational. It's not heroin. It's not even illegal. Yeah, using you might get away with. Dealing's a different matter, isn't it, Mikey? Bung him in the car. Who was that? Nobody you know. What did they want? It's so easy being a child, isn't it? All you do is ask questions all day long. "Why, Mummy? Why, Mummy?" You never have any answers, do you? I really don't think you should smoke in front of the child. Oh, don't you? I thought you were the au pair, not Health and Safety. It's not right. Just so you know - by the time I was her age, I'd already been bombed out of my house by Israeli shelling. I don't think a stray B&H; is going to do her much harm. Yeah! Yeah, well, we all want to get away.... You all right? Yeah, I'm all right. What's bugging you? Is it the sex-pest? SHE LAUGHS You should be careful. The last girl he hit on, he broke into her e-mail account. He read all her private stuff. I have no private stuff. No? TV: We have some breaking news regarding the shooting in South London. Do we know the name of the victim? We're not yet confirming the identity of the murdered man. All we are saying is that he was Syrian. Do we know that for a fact? Well, all the signs are that he was from Aleppo and that he'd recently arrived seeking political asylum. Arrived legally? I don't want to say any more. It wouldn't be right at this point in the investigation. I don't want to say anything that might prejudice that process. So thank you very much. SOLDIERS DRILL, BELL TOLLS I need to know - did I get the right one? HE PANTS Ah, as usual, Sarah, you're always ahead of me. As you expect. Did you have a nice evening? Don't you have a new one? Yes. This one's a banker. Very good. Aren't they all bankers? Not always. Investment fund managers sometimes. I've even dated private equity. There's a message on the answerphone. I'll make coffee. Thanks. ANSWERPHONE: Enter your password. You have one new message. SANDRINE: I need to know - did I get the right one? Message deleted. I've got Mikey downstairs. He's running a nice little drug distribution business. Well done! Before we go in - Fuzz, do you mind telling Nathan exactly what you told me? Er, yeah, first thing, obvious, the man's an expert, knows about forensics. Also... Yeah? A shell was found at the scene which we identified as military. The bottom of the case has the letters RG - Radway Green. That's the manufacturer that makes stuff for the armed forces. So the shooter's a soldier? Well, all I'd say is had access to military ammunition. But it's British military? I'll give you more as soon as I have it. Doesn't sound like it's got much to do with Mikey. Well, why don't we find out? Do you recognise this? Do you know where we found it? No. How much is it? There's a thousand in there. What I do is £20 packets. I don't see that kind of money. Is it just certain customers? They say they want a special topping. Special topping? Who do they say it to? Who do they say it to, Mikey? It was my idea. I...I thought of it. Sure. But it's not you on the phone, so who is it? Is it someone who needs money to look after their mother? It's me. I distribute. I...er...I take the risk. Yeah, but she gets a cut? Look you can't expect me to say. Rakhee, we need an All Ports Warning out as soon as you can. For Laurie Stone? Yeah, Laurie Stone, and someone needs to go to her flat, just in case. I'm on it. "Dear Jane. I'm going to go now. "I've got to sort things out for myself, whatever that means. "Funny how you're never ready when the moment comes. "You think you'll be ready, but you're not. "I knew what was right and I ignored it. "What can I do? Thanks for listening. "It means the world to me to talk to a priest. Laurie." Sandrine! Take it up, Amanda! Come on... Get it! Push forward...Sandrine! Here! Here! Sandrine! Pass it back, pass it back! Over here, over here. Sandrine...forward...to the right...Sandrine! For fuck's sake. Seriously? PHONE RINGS Pimlico Travel. Hello? Hello? Is that you? Ah, excellent. The phone rang again. I heard you answer it. I told her to throw it away. Well, she hasn't. Why not? Parmesan? I don't like what's happening. I smell panic. We can't find Laurie. She's gone missing. The flat's up there. Yeah, OK. The police are after her as well. We just have to wait. Right, you two, upstairs. Sure. Whatever you want. No problem. Well, this is an honour. Hardly. We don't get many Members of Parliament. David Mars. Kip Glaspie. Kip Glaspie. Are you the... Yeah. I was. Goodness. The athlete. I remember watching you on the telly. That was...that was a bad one. Yeah. And you're the guy who wants to let everyone out of prison. I did, until they moved me. That's why they put me into Transport. Listen, this is rather tricky. Do you mind if we speak outside? Yeah. Well? This is difficult for me. I have to guess whether it's possible to talk to you. It's a character judgment. I'm trying to guess what kind of person you are. Guess away. Is this about your ex? No, as a matter of fact, it isn't. It's about your witness. Which witness? The Vietnamese girl. Hanh Giang? Well, she gave you a false name for a start. What's her real name? Linh Xuan Huy. Why did she do that? A whole bunch of reasons, nothing to do with the case. Where does she live? I'm going to find out anyway. In fact, I can't see what you're doing here. All you're doing is kicking her problems down the road. She knows that. Her residential status is uncertain. We're all very keen that the focus of the investigation remains on the murder. You know I can't promise anything. No. But she's frightened. Linh lives with a priest. You're going to find all this out. Am I? Yeah, the priest, she's already in trouble with the bishop. Why? Because she's a she. So what's your connection? I'm very good friends with the vicar. Actually, I'm more of an admirer. In this community, there are very few practical people who do more than just talk about doing good. That's Jane. I hope you're not leaning on me. I'm not. I'm briefing you. Good. These are good people. That's all. Now, because she was on drugs, Linh was reluctant to tell you. She can't be sure, but she thinks the killer was a woman. A woman? Yeah. Did she see clearly? No. OK. I need to see her. Get her to come in, quickly. I will. Is there anything else? Yeah, you should know... I signed her student visa application without knowing she was here illegally. Then at last I've met someone whose problems are worse than my own. SHE PANTS EXPLOSION, MEN SHOUT GUNFIRE Let's go and see what the guv's saying. See you later. See ya. I hope you're not coming in, sir. I'm waiting outside. I'm allowed to wait here. I am your superior officer. I can do what I want. I think this is yours. Will you fuck off? Will you fuck off and leave me alone? Sir? What was all that about? What? Outside. Oh, I'll tell you later. Will you? We're late! You didn't want me to hear. What were you up to? Nothing. Nothing, trust me. Fuzz. Yeah. The Vietnamese girl, the witness. Yeah? She's now saying the shooter could have been a woman. When did she say that? I'll tell you in a minute. Is it possible? Yeah, I don't see why not. I was going to tell you. When? Straight away, as soon as I heard. I thought the witness was meant to come in. She was. She's coming back. She gave us a false address. What are you saying? She's an illegal? Oh, I see. Now I get it. That's what the wanker MP was doing. I didn't promise him anything. Oh, like hell. And you don't care that he was the husband of a principal suspect? Karen Mars? Is she a suspect? What's the one thing everyone knows? Every week, on the same day, at the same time, the same person orders the same pizza. With dope. And you don't think that person's implicated? You don't think they set the killing up? I have to be honest, I don't. Needless to say you don't want to prosecute the girl. Oh, come on, be serious. I am. If you'd asked me, "How will Kip react to a drugged-out illegal?" I could have written the answer. "How she always reacts!" This is little stuff, Nathan. We're on a murder case. Policing isn't scorched earth. No, and it isn't doing deals. I think it is doing deals. That's exactly what it is. I'm Kip Glaspie. This is Nathan Bilk. This is a colleague from the security services. Do you have a name? Sam Spence. MI5. I'm here because we believe there's a national security dimension. Yeah, I think we've worked that out for ourselves. Always the same. Police can't get a result on their own. We always have to step in and save the situation. Like you did with Iraq. They're really nice women. Truly. Most of them. They all get on pretty well. You don't have much trouble? It's a lot like a slaughterhouse. You need to calm the animals. They'll be down in a minute. I thought you were bringing an interpreter? We're conducting this interview in English. My English not good. Don't start this meeting with lies. You're an intelligent woman. You have money. How you know that? Fatima, we need to know everything that's happened to you since you've arrived. You say you've been working in a hotel? Yes. Why were you living in a garage? We were hiding. Hiding? So you're saying your brother was killed deliberately? The bullet was meant for him? Because? Because he knew something. What? He had papers. What papers? Papers he found at sea. What happened exactly? Abdullah took over the boat. There was a fight with the captain. We had to look out for ourselves. We had to find a way to survive. What way? No. I don't want to say. All right, I'm going to tell you something, Fatima. You say you came through Turkey. Yeah? Where? Izmir, I'd guess. Am I right? I know Izmir. I know Basmane Square. I know every shop on the port that sells inflatable boats. I know where you can buy engines, where you buy petrol, where you buy life jackets. I know where you buy balloons. Did you buy balloons? Keep your possessions dry, right? I probably know the beach where you landed on and the beach where you arrived. Was it Lesvos? Chios? Samos. Samos. OK. You're going to have to tell me something I don't already know. We set out. Yes? The boat was over-loaded. There were too many of us. And we were packed together. I was worried for Mona because she's... Because what? Abdullah decided we did something. There was a fight. The captain was killed. That's all I know. How was he killed? I don't know. I didn't see. HE SCOFFS Fatima, I'm trying to make sense of this. Did the captain have a gun? Yes, I think so. So, somehow, probably what you're saying is Abdullah must have taken the gun from him? Abdullah was defending himself. He had the right. He used the gun? And when we got to London, they murdered Abdullah because he had papers. He knew who the smugglers were. Oh, so you can give us their names? I can't. No. I bet you can't. I'll tell you one thing. One thing only. They were English. You're telling us the people smugglers were English? HE SCOFFS I don't think that's very likely. It's true. Englishman owns the boat. Englishman runs everything. Everything. Passports, trains, tickets. This is A-grade service. All right. You said you came from Aleppo? Yes. You worked in a hotel before the city was destroyed. Can you name the hotel? The Baron. I know the Baron. What street is it on? Al Mutanabbi. No. Try again. I may have made a mistake. Yeah, you did. It's on Al Khandaq. No. The Baron Hotel... is on Baron Street. Your whole fucking story is a lie. You're no more Syrian than I am. You lost your papers. Please! We all know Syrians automatically qualify for asylum. Suddenly everyone's Syrian. What are you? I'm just a mid-level English racist, but I do know the difference. You're fucking Iraqi. Therefore, you have no right to asylum, and if you think you can blackmail us by withholding information, you're wrong. I don't trust you. Not till I have papers. A residence permit, for me and for my sister. That's not how it works. Information first and then we'll consider. And we don't do promises. Oh, by the way, I don't believe in your Englishman. An English people-smuggler and we don't know of him? Then why was Abdullah killed here? She's a fucking liar. She'll say anything. I didn't believe a word she said. She'll say the Archbishop of Canterbury's running day trips from Aleppo if she thinks that'll get her a visa. They're all the same. Who are "they"? You know perfectly well. Her brother was shot in the street because he knew the name of the smuggler. Think about it. What's your problem with that? Who shot him? We haven't even had 24 hours! You people are utterly pathetic. You've no balls. You want to hand out visas like confetti. You're not even police. You're social workers. They know that. They'll hook you. Tell you exactly what you want to hear. We don't even know their real names. Could be anyone. Have you thought about that? There's no deal until she gives us the identity of this so-called English smuggler. Or until we find the killer. Oh, yeah. Call when you do. Here, you seem smarter than her. Keep in touch. Help us both. LOUDSPEAKER: This is the final call for the 21:58 West Coast Service to Portsmouth Harbour. Now leaving from Platform three. DOORS BEEP What a depressing place. Where? Harlsfleet, of course. What's depressing about it? It doesn't bother you? Why should it? It's clean. It's warm. It's decently run. What's your problem? You want them all staying with you and Gerald? If anyone does come to this country to do harm, then I want them behind bars. But I want the innocent ones treated like human beings. Oh, you know how to tell the difference, do you? Not always. But I think I'm better at it than your new friend Sam. CHATTER Right. Good night, everybody. Mwa! Mmmwa! Try not to be too late. I shan't. Mwa! Or drunk. That's more difficult. Mwa! Good night. # Bring me by bow # Of burning gold # Bring me my arrows of desire # Bring me my spear # O clouds unfold # Bring me my chariot of fire # I will not cease from mental fight # Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand # Till we have built Jerusalem # In England's green and pleasant land. # CHEERING AND LAUGHTER Of course, not all of us can be in Special Reconnaissance, can we, Chips? What's your point? Well, Special Reconnaissance is sort of an elite. Special, you see. Not for the likes of regular soldiers. I mean, what you're doing in Special Reconnaissance isn't really what I'd call soldiering, is it? Because it's spying. Spying's not soldiering. It's girls' stuff. Enough, Dyson.
