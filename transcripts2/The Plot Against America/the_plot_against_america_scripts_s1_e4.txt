 ♪ (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS) ♪ HERMAN LEVIN: This is my country. Jew haters want a country, they got plenty to choose from. This one they're not getting. MAN: Isn't that something? To see the American president shaking hands with Hitler like he's any other fella. So, we need to be absorbed, do we? I'm not American enough? You're scared of anywhere you haven't been or anyone who isn't Jewish! I wanna go to Kentucky, and I wanna live on a farm.

 Truth is, I loved my wife, and now very quickly, I find that I love you in the same way. HERMAN: What's our luggage doing here? There are no vacancies. Take your family and leave. Immediately. Because we're Jewish. That's what this is about. MAN 2: You are aware of radar? I signed on to kill Krauts. Not to rummage around machine parts. I'm not over here because I'm an American. Shit, my country's gone to hell. ♪ (MUSIC INTENSIFIES) ♪ Since the election, only Jewish kids are having fight or flight dreams.

RABBI PRINZ: As we remember the life of Dora Finkel, it is meaningful, I think, to admire the great journey that she represents in beginning her life in a Russian shtetl, coming to this new country as a young girl, and making a life for herself and her family in a new land. Our parents are the generation that risked all to make us Americans. And we are, indeed, now Americans. And now, the Mourner's Kaddish. (RABBI AND MOURNERS RECITE HEBREW PRAYER) Dodgers beat Braves, four‐two. Indian takes White Sox, two‐one. Reds clobber Cubs, two‐nothing. How ya doin', Little Robert? ‐How're you, Herman? ‐Yanks keep pace? You bet, beat the Athletics, seven‐two. Come on. Dodgers beat Braves, four‐two... Does he have a last name? Do you? So does he. What is it? To tell you the truth, I don't know Robert's last name. ‐CASHIER: Good morning, Mister L. ‐Uh, two of the cinnamon babka, four dozen of the rugelach, assorted, ‐and a jelly for my valet here. ‐CASHIER: Of course. NORMAN PARETSKY: Herman... I saw the obituary for your mother‐in‐law. Her memory should be a blessing for you and Bess. HERMAN LEVIN: Thank you, Norman. Are you picking up for the shiva? All but a couple dozen rugelach. Those, I'm taking up to my nephew in Montreal. He's, uh... He's recovering from wounds in a hospital there. Well, in that case, it's all gratis. Norman, you don't have to do that. Yes, I do. Give Bess my condolences. LITTLE ROBERT: ...five‐four! Can I go with you to Canada? You have school tomorrow, Philip. Can't miss two days in a row. LITTLE ROBERT: ...seven‐two! Dodger beat Braves... ‐Dad? ‐HERMAN: Hmm? What is Alvin going to do? What will he do? LITTLE ROBERT: Reds clobber Cubs, two‐nothing. HERMAN: He'll find his way, kiddo. I'm glad Herman agreed to have you and Lionel over for dinner on Friday. I'm glad for that, Ev. Wait till you see what came today. So grown up, isn't he? BESS LEVIN: Uh... It was nice of you to think of Sandy, ‐but I don't want‐‐ ‐You hate it. I'll use another boy. It's just, he's such a good‐looking kid. We would feature him on the brochure, and we could even have him talk to small groups of people ‐about the program‐‐ ‐It's all too much, Ev. I‐‐ I don't want him getting full of himself. Thank you. EVELYN FINKEL: It's a good thing she let me keep her accounts in order these past few months. You know she didn't want the help. BESS: For the insurance policy, I‐‐ I'll‐‐ I'll take it to Herman's office. They'll notarize and process it faster than if we... HERMAN: Well, I certainly got enough for more than you two ladies. BESS: The Tirschwells were here, and the rabbi and his wife. ‐And Mrs. Steiner. ‐They may be back tonight. You're gonna have to make a minyan without me. I'm sorry for that, but I have to get on the road if I'm gonna get there and see Alvin and get back in time for my Friday collections. Have you heard anything from Alvin? HERMAN: Not a word. I don't understand. I've been writing him for weeks. Well, maybe he's unable to write. It's a leg, Ev. Whatever he has to say, I'll hear it soon enough. Travel safe. ‐(NURSES AND PATIENTS CLAMORING) ‐PATIENT: Nurse? (BELL DINGS) Please... I need a doctor. Skipping dinner again? Do you need me to empty the pan? ALVIN LEVIN: Kill me first. (CHUCKLES) It's my job. Don't let it bother you, Corporal Levin. Or can I call you Alvin? You know, you can call me Jenny. It's Jane Reedlaw, ‐but I go by Jenny‐‐ ‐I know your name. Seeing as you haven't used it yet, ‐I just thought I'd remind you‐‐ ‐Yeah, what should we do now? You wanna go dancing, Jenny Reedlaw? I used to manage a pretty good jitterbug. Or maybe we could Lindy Hop. ‐Do you want‐‐ ‐No. I don't want. (GRUNTS) ‐(RADIO PLAYS INSIDE BUILDING) ‐(GAS PUMP DINGS) ‐(RADIO STATIC) ‐(VOICES OVERLAPPING) ‐(TELEGRAPH PULSES) ‐WALTER WINCHELL: New York. FDR is said to have sent the following telegram to President Lindbergh: "Mr. President, ‐Rescind the White House state dinner invitation... ‐(GAS PUMP DINGS) ...of German Foreign Minister von Ribbentrop for the sake of all freedom‐loving Americans, and particularly the tens of millions of Americans of European stock, whose ancestral countries must live beneath the crushing yoke of the Nazis." FDR is the latest to join the chorus: Rescind. Rescind. ‐(TELEGRAPH PULSES) ‐Flash: Washington. A resolution drafted by House Democrats against Lindy's dinner date has stalled in committee. ‐Word is Republican... ‐(RADIO CHANGES STATIONS) DELI MANAGER: ...in honor of you having taken all your meals with us during your stay here in the islands, we'd like to present you with this. JACK BENNY: Oh, well, that's‐‐ Well, of course, I‐‐ I noticed that the other passengers received leis of, uh, of ginger and orchids. What is this one made of? DELI MANAGER: Chicken livers. (AUDIENCE LAUGHTER) JACK BENNY: Chicken livers? ROCHESTER VAN JONES: You better not wear it on board, boss! The seagulls will drive us crazy. (AUDIENCE LAUGHTER) JACK BENNY: Never mind. Thank you. Thank you very, very much. (DOOR CLOSES) PHILIP LEVIN: Were you afraid? SANDY LEVIN: Of what? PHILIP: Of being away from home. No. PHILIP: Did you like the family? The Mawhinneys? Yeah. ‐Did they like you? ‐Yeah, I think so. PHILIP: Did you eat one of those? SANDY: No, these are piglets. They've gotta fatten them up first. Is that Mr. Ma... Mawhinney? Yeah. That's the pig we ate the Sunday before I left. Keep your mouth shut about it, though. ‐Why? ‐Pigs aren't kosher, remember? But we don't keep kosher. Only Grandma did that. Even so, Dad would make a big deal about it if he knew. So zip it. (WHEELCHAIR CREAKS) You have a visitor. Alvin, I've known you since you were born. You're a fighter. You got your father's strength. (CHUCKLES) Your father could take the hardest blow, and still keep going. Our home is your home. Always. ‐(DISTANT CHATTER) ‐(WATER TRICKLING) (BELL DINGS) NURSE JENNY: They're all angry in some way. But no one like him. (GURNEY CLATTERING) (MARTIN WISHNOW COUGHING) HOSPITAL ATTENDANT: Lock it down. ‐(MARTIN COUGHING) ‐(SELMA WISHNOW PANTING) Oh! I forgot my keys. BESS: I have an extra set. Use our door, go down the stairs if I'm not here. I'll come home from work early. I'll take Seldon if you're still at the hospital. ‐SELMA: Thank you, Bess. ‐BESS: Go with Martin. ‐SELMA: Okay. (TOOLS CLINKING) DRIVER: Landsman? Landsman. Need a hand? ‐(BABY CRYING) ‐(WOMAN SHUSHING) I got it, thanks. If you're headed back to New Jersey, zay gesundt. Safe travels. Zay gesundt. SANDY: This, too, was new to me. The way time slows down in the country, so there's time to think or just be. We worked hard, yes, but when the work was done, there were moments of quiet calm. My favorite moments came in the evening, when we would walk the long dirt road to bring the horses in for the night. I hope Just Folks gives you, too, the change to walk a similar road and meet the kind people of our great country, the people of real America. Thank you very much. (APPLAUSE) Now, I would like to introduce our associate program director, Miss Evelyn Finkel. Thank you, Recruiting Officer Levin. I cannot emphasize what a valuable experience Just Folks has been for Sandy. ‐WOMAN: No. ‐So consider it a mitzvah to send the best young men of Anshe Emeth ‐to America's heartland. ‐(THUNDER BOOMS) MONTY LEVIN: And at least twenty bushels of the Rutgers, not Romas. PRODUCE WORKER: Won't get the Romas from Chester again... Monty, you don't have a clean shirt around here somewhere? You know, it's late, Herman. Why don't you go home, call it day? If I can just get presentable, I can still make my day's collections, leave them for Karl in the morning. Drive took a hell of a lot longer than I thought. But was it worth it? He's family, Monty. We have to bring him home. Even when Canada's gonna pay him to sit on his ass, which is the best job for a schmuck like him. You know, if Jack was alive, he would've never gotten out the front door. In fact, you shouldn't have let him go. I didn't let him go. Right, he ran away to become a war hero, and where did it land him? A goddamn invalid for the rest of his life. ‐Over what? ‐"Over what?" Alvin can't bear your Nazi‐loving president, that's why he left. You know, not so long ago, you couldn't bear the man either. But now what? Stock market is up, profits are up, business is booming. Everything else about Lindbergh, what he stands for, is forgotten? What else matters to you, a businessman, if the money is right? Boy, you know, you sound just like the stupid kid. "What else matters?" Do your boys matter? Hmm? Sandy? You want him to come home one day like that? How 'bout Philip? You want him to wind up in a grave in France or wherever the hell else? What are out of the war! We're staying out of the war! Lindbergh, he's done no harm to any of us as far I can see. You know, that's the thing, Monty. You don't see much outside of your own little world. ‐Okay. ‐(PHONE RINGS) ‐There were Germans who voted their pocketbooks, too. ‐Oh, please! You give these people an inch, you see what they take next. Okay. All right. I'm waiting, Herman. (THUNDER BOOMS) DETECTIVE WOMAN: (ON RADIO) ...picked up Sam and drove over to the Coroner's Office in Long Beach. It was the usual routine. Questions, answers. I testified. So did Sam and everyone else. But there was only one opening: Miller Gray at the Harbor Hotel in San Pedro, ‐and that's where I went. ‐♪ (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYS) ♪ HOTEL CLERK: Who? DETECTIVE WOMAN: I'll say it again. Gray. Miller Gray. HOTEL CLERK: I don't think we have anyone registered here under that name... (SIGHS) Are you hungry? No. ‐HOTEL CLERK: Yes, of course. ‐DETECTIVE WOMAN: Well? HOTEL CLERK: I'm terribly sorry... ‐And Alvin? ‐(RADIO SHOW CONTINUES) Eh... He's not the same. But when we get him home... (SIGHS) And Canada? Bess, I was there for six hours. ‐And how did it feel to you? ‐Bess... I'm asking about Canada. It's another place. Another country. It's not my country. (RADIO SHOW CONTINUES) DETECTIVE WOMAN: ...the body of what had been an attractive man in his early twenties sprawled out on the floor on the other side... DOCTOR: Oh. Keep massaging the scar tissue. Let's take a look at this. ‐It's healing nicely. ‐NURSE 1: I'll be back. Before long, you'll be back home. Where's home for you, son? ‐New Jersey. ‐NURSE 2: How are we feeling over here? Be wise to call Canada home. We take care of our own. You have served king and country here. Just make sure he gets in to see the benefits administrator. ‐(NURSE 3 LAUGHS) ‐PATIENT: Uh, yeah, okay. You may find that your countrymen in New Jersey do not have the same high regard for your sacrifice as we do. RABBI LIONEL BENGELSDORF: Well, it's always a delight to be in a well‐tended Jewish home on a Friday evening. Bess, your Sabbath home brings to mind a phrase from the Yiddish tongue. HERMAN: Balabusta. BENGELSDORF: You speak Yiddish, Herman? A phrase here and there, not really. Well, balabusta is the correct phrase. HERMAN: Roughly translated, it means a woman who keeps a good Jewish home. I thank you both. EVELYN: Sandy, why don't you tell the rabbi about your time in Kentucky. Yes, where was the farm exactly? Uh, Perryville. It's near Lexington. EVELYN: And tell him what you learned there. I learned a lot about my country, sir, and a lot about growing tobacco. BENGELSDORF: Did you know, Sandy, that tobacco was the economic foundation of the first English settlement at Jamestown in Virginia? SANDY: No, I didn't. But I saw how much money Mr. Mawhinney made after only a couple hours ‐of selling it at the market. ‐(BENGELSDORF CHUCKLES) Well, tobacco and cotton built the South. That's a region for which I have some special affection, having been born there. Indeed, my father, after emigrating from Germany, went south with a horse and a wagon. He was a peddler, mind you. He fought for the Confederacy. He was wounded at Chancellorsville, and he also fought at Sharpsburg, which you in the North call Antietam, bloodiest day of the war. He was with the sharpshooters in Toombs' Brigade when they held off a whole wing of the Union army for six hours. Once, we were slaves in Egypt, says the Haggadah. But your father, he fought with Pharaoh. BENGELSDORF: Hardly the only one. Did you ever hear of Judah Benjamin? SANDY: Was that your father's name? BENGELSDORF: (LAUGHING) No, no. Mr. Benjamin was not my father. He was a very prominent and respected Jewish lawyer. Before secession, he served as a senator from South Carolina, and during the war, he was second only to Jefferson Davis in the government of the Confederacy. A Jew supporting an immoral cause, on the wrong side of American history. BENGELSDORF: Well, I certainly agree, Herman. The cause for which the South went to war was neither legal nor moral in my judgment. And yet, I've always held Judah Benjamin in the highest regard. And a Jew was a rarity in America in those days, and Mr. Benjamin came very close to the pinnacle of political success. Well, this is all very interesting, but if you'll excuse me. Sandy, come over here. Why don't you show the rabbi your sketches. BENGELSDORF: Hmm. This is a barn and a hog shed that Mr. Mawhinney built with his own hands. You do have a talent, Sandy. (EVELYN CHUCKLES) HERMAN: But Rabbi, you make it sound as if... Europe's young men are less valuable, that‐‐ that European Jews are less important... ‐A life is a life. ‐BENGELSDORF: I abhor all war. And Europe is a charnel house and will be so forever, I fear. But America has freed itself of that vile history, and in doing so, becomes our best possible future as Jews. You abhor war, but not Hitler. This madman is making a war such as no one has ever seen before. BENGELSDORF: I have only contempt for Adolf Hitler, ‐and‐‐ ‐All right, boys, time for bed. No chores tonight. I have Ev to help me. Go on. BENGELSDORF: Delighted to see you again, Sandy. And you, too, Philip. HERMAN: There are men and women who don't feel as you do, Rabbi. They see evil, wherever it is, and they act. War is an evil. I am acting on that. HERMAN: A necessary evil, in some cases. I have a nephew fighting with the Canadians, volunteering against Hitler and his kind. He's been wounded. Your brother's son. Evelyn told me. The loss of a leg. It will require all the love and patience you have to deliver him to a place that he can again resume a useful life. His life never ceased to be useful, Rabbi. ‐To me... Alvin is a hero. ‐And to me, a tragedy. This country is not at war. We do not require our young men to sacrifice life or limb. And some of us have gone to great effort to make this so. I guess Alvin counted himself a citizen of the world... and a Jew. And since everywhere he goes, Hitler beats down and shoots the Jews... there may be a time where he comes here to America to beat down and shoot us. And what will our president do then? Defend us? Or have he and Herr Hitler reached another understanding? PHILIP: Sandy, do you wanna see my stamps? Sandy, did you hear me? I was at the White House talking to the president just yesterday morning. And I informed the president that any number of my own congregants who had voted for Roosevelt were now his strong supporters, grateful that he had spared our country the agonies of yet another Great War. Admittedly, before becoming president, Mr. Lindbergh made some statements grounded in anti‐Semitic cliché, but he did so out of ignorance. And I can assure you, today, that he privately acknowledges this ‐in so many words. ‐Privately. This is not an evil man, Herman, not in any way. And I was proud to tell him that Just Folks and programs like it were beginning to convince the Jews of America that he is anything but their enemy. BESS: Evelyn. A hand, please. BENGELSDORF: It is ignorant to think of our president as some sort of American Hitler when we know full well that Mr. Lindbergh attained power in a free and fair election... Why did you send the boys to bed? Because it's bedtime. And because I don't want Sandy turning into a know‐it‐all. BENGELSDORF: ...of the Nuremburg laws that deprive German Jews of their civil rights and membership in their nation. But I have encouraged President Lindbergh to invite Jews to make this country our own as much as any other citizens. BESS: ...a hand with the drying, please? Tell me, Herman... is that beginning to address your fears? Not for a moment. And to hear someone like yourself talk like that... frankly, it alarms me even more. ‐(DISHES CLATTERING) ‐EVELYN: This has been cleaned. BESS: Just put the silverware away. More tea, rebbe? I'm just fine, thanks. (FOOTSTEPS) (GRUNTS) (WINCES) (GROANS) (BEDPAN SLOSHING) (PANTING) (BEDPAN SPLASHES, CLANGS) PATIENT: Huh? What was that? (GRUNTING) NURSE JENNY: Oh, dear. I'll be right back. (BREATHING HEAVILY) ANNOUNCER: (ON PA) Change for northbound train 332, the Ambassador, ‐with station stops in St. John's and Montreal. ‐(TYPEWRITERS CLACKING) This train will now depart from track one. The Ambassador to Montreal, train 332, now arriving, track one. Levin. Levin! How did you lose your leg, Levin? ATTENDANT: Climbing accident. In the Laurentians a few months ago. Mountain climbing in Quebec? FBI AGENT: Under the Neutrality Law, Mr. Levin, citizens of the United States are prohibited from engaging as combatants in any conflict overseas. Where exactly were you climbing? Norway. Norway. What happened there? An accident. I tripped... over a dead Nazi. War's done for me. I'm going home to Jersey. You wanna grab up a cripple, and wheel him away, you have at it, Mr. G‐man. BENGELSDORF: So, now we find ourselves at the brink of initiating the second phase of this great undertaking. First, we gave our Jewish youth a taste of the American heartland. Now, we open the country to a permanent migration of Jewish families. Last week, Congressman Vogel and Secretary Ford had the privilege of hosting, here in Washington, distinguished leaders from JP Morgan, Chase Bank, Coca‐Cola, Dow Chemical, Metropolitan Life, Woolworth, International Business Machines, of course, Ford Motors, and, as much as it pained Secretary Ford, General Motors. (ALL CHUCKLING) These American businesses will lend direct support as the new Homestead Act moves through Congress. OAA OFFICIAL: What does direct support mean? BENGELSDORF: Well, these are national companies and financial institutions, each with a presence coast to coast. To the extent that Jewish employees need to be relocated, these employers will service that need. To be clear, the Homestead Act involves voluntary participation in the program, correct? How could it be otherwise? This is a free country. SANDY: Alvin! ANNOUNCER: (ON PA) Last call on track three for southbound train 170 making stops in North Philadelphia, Wilmington, Baltimore, Washington. All aboard train 170 on track three. HERMAN: You're here, you're home. ‐Thank you, sir. ‐ATTENDANT: Compliments and gratitude of the Canadian government and people. Good luck to you, corporal. ALVIN: Bess... HERMAN: Philip. ANNOUNCER: All aboard train 170 on track three. ‐WOMAN: Okay! ‐MAN: Come on, come on, let's go, let's go. All right, let's go. HERMAN: I thought you'd be up by now. I thought they couldn't discharge you otherwise. ‐What's happened? ‐Stump broke down. ‐What does that mean? ‐What it sounds like. You got any luggage? Sure. In the baggage car. Where'd you think my leg is? ♪ (SWING MUSIC PLAYS ON RADIO) ♪ (ALVIN GROANS) ‐(DOOR OPENS) ‐♪ (MUSIC CONTINUES DISTANTLY) ♪ It's all right to be upset. PHILIP: I'm not upset. Philip, you've lost your grandma, and Mr. Wishnow downstairs is also very sick. And now... (SIGHS) ...our Alvin has come back to us in a bad way. It's a hard time, I know. (WHISPERING) Alvin is ashamed. He is ashamed for us to see him hop around. Ashamed for us to see him in a wheelchair. When he left, he was strong and independent. And now, he probably wants to hide and scream. But it won't be long until he realizes there's nothing about the way he looks or... about what happened to him to be ashamed of. I'm not thinking about that. Philip, what if Sandy moved back from the sewing room to‐‐ to his own bed? Then Alvin could sleep in your bed, and you could have the sewing room all to yourself. It's my bed. My room. I'll be fine. ‐(PHONES RINGING) ‐(OFFICIALS CHATTERING) WOMAN: ...files. I'll have them on your desk within the hour. But, so, you've reached out to various Jewish organizations‐‐ ‐ANNE LINDBERGH: Yes, I've‐‐ ‐Oh! My‐‐ Mrs. Lindbergh. ‐I‐‐ I didn't realize‐‐ ‐No, no, no, no, no. We've summoned you for a reason. Please, join us. It is such a pleasure to finally meet Rabbi Bengelsdorf's fiancée. And the director of the New Jersey office as well. ANNE: I have heard such good things. EVELYN: Oh... (STAMMERS) Thank you. So, Miss Finkel. Duty again calls. I'll let the First Lady explain. Well. As you know, we are planning for the upcoming visit of Herr von Ribbentrop, the German minister. And while I can assure you Charles and I in no way agree with all the policies of von Ribbentrop's government, particularly in regard... to Jewish matters, we nonetheless realize the great importance of normalizing our relations and maintaining the understanding my husband came to with the Germans in Iceland. For peace. ‐Yes. F‐‐ For peace. ‐ANNE: Just so. But we are also aware that to host a state dinner and not highlight some representation among America's Jewish leaders would send the wrong message, not only to Americans, but to the Germans as well. BENGELSDORF: It would be valuable to show von Ribbentrop that Jews are as much a part of this country's political and social landscape as anyone else. Yes. Well, the problem thus far is the Jewish leaders we've asked to attend this state dinner have declined. BENGELSDORF: It's been suggested that in addition to Secretary Ford, we would represent the US Department of Interior at the dinner. And of course, you would both be featured prominently as representatives of your community. But, in doing so, mind you, we would, in no way, be endorsing all of the Nazi policies, ‐particularly those that affect our community‐‐ ‐Can we bring Sandy? (STAMMERS) Evelyn, this is a state dinner. Who is Sandy? Sanford Levin. My‐‐ My nephew. He's wonderful. He's‐‐ He's become the New Jersey poster boy for the administration's Just Folks program, and he just spent the summer in Kentucky. (CHUCKLES) ‐And how old is this young man? ‐Fifteen. Oh, no. He got caught. SELDON WISHNOW: Doing what? PHILIP: Playing spy. You're Philip? Is your ma home, Philip? She's upstairs in the kitchen. PHILIP: Earl, what happened? ‐Who is that man? ‐My father. Teacher's been asking about you. I have to go live with my bubbe in New York City. Because of our spying on people? No, dummy. Because of Louise. What did she do? She went crazy. They took her to Marlboro. To the looney bin. Is that your dad who saw the Hawaii stamp? Yeah. That reminds me... NEIGHBOR 1: I would love your chocolate cake recipe! My David loves chocolate cake. MAX AXMAN: Philip. I gave your mother the address of where Earl will be living in New York City. You can write to him every now and then, if you'd like. PHILIP: Okay. ‐(ENGINE STARTS) ‐Bye, Philip. Bye, Earl. Am I your best friend now? NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER: And with his first public appearance in several months, Roosevelt addressed the rowdy crowd protesting the upcoming state dinner. (CROWD CHEERING) FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT: This shameless courting by President Lindbergh of a cruel and barbaric tyrant is unparalleled in the chronicle of man's misdeeds. We Americans do not wish to see Nazis... THEATERGOER 1: Get off the stage, Jew lover! ‐(AUDIENCE SHUSHING) ‐(SCATTERED LAUGHS AND APPLAUSE) ROOSEVELT: We Americans... THEATERGOER 2: Shut up, I'm trying to watch somethin'. ROOSEVELT: ...will not accept a Hitler‐dominated America. We Americans will not accept a Hitler‐dominated world. ANNOUNCER: At the conclusion of his speech, the demonstrators continued their march down Broadway, where New York City Mayor La Guardia made additional remarks in opposition... MONTY: Spit it out, kid. ALVIN: We were on the beach... waiting to get out. Just waiting for the boat. Someone shot a German. He was out there in the dunes, screaming for a while. I listened for about as long as I could, then I crawled over to where he was. Maybe 50 yards. By then, he was dead. But I got out my rifle and I shot him twice in the head. And I spit on the Nazi son of a bitch. In that second, just... (QUIETLY IMITATES EXPLOSION) Grenade. ‐MONTY: Christ. ‐(CLEARS THROAT) So now what? You gonna lay around here like a... like a sharpie out of luck? Or would you consider supporting yourself like the rest of us dumb mortals do? There's a job for you at the market. I mean, it ain't driving Abe Steinheim around in a pretty suit and tie, but... it's honest work. Six days a week. Monty. Think you could give me an advance on that first week? Just a fin or two till I'm able. Any other questions? Okay, if you'd like to apply, you can sign up over here. Thank you. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) GIRL: Stacy, wait up! Aunt Ev, I thought you were in Washington. I was. I took the Streamliner all the way back because I wanted to see your face when I gave you this. ‐BOY 1: Billy, come on, we're gonna be late. ‐BOY 2: Yeah... I kinda, um... didn't do it, so... can I just copy what you have? ‐I mean, at least that way... ‐(LAUGHS) ♪ (MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO) ♪ ALVIN: What's your hurry, kiddo? (CAR HONKS) (CLEARS THROAT) SHUSHY MARGULIS: Hey, soldier boy. ‐Oh, fuck you, Shush. ‐(LAUGHS) (ALVIN GRUNTS) So. Where's the game? ‐BESS: What are you thinking? ‐The man is a Nazi. ‐I'm going. ‐Absolutely not. No. Never. I'm going, and I'm never coming back. ‐Sandy! Sandy! ‐Sandy! Sandy! Come on. Come on! Hard eight! ‐Hard eight! ‐Nah, I can't bet with this guy. How do you expect any fucker with one leg to ever be lucky? ‐Come on. ‐I'll cover that. MAN: No, he's crapping out here. ‐Bang! Yes! Yes! ‐(ALL EXCLAIM) ‐Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme. ‐How the fuck did that hit? All right, fuck it, new shooter. ‐SHUSHY: Let's get outta here. ‐Come on! ‐You ain't gonna give us more of a chance to win it back? ‐No, I'm thirsty. Catch. All right, where's the drink? Let's go downtown to The Empire. I want you to meet Abie. It's the guy I run numbers for. I told you, Abie's my guy. He introduced me to Longy. (LAUGHS) You met Longy Zwillman? While you went away to get your leg knocked off, I was busy gettin' ahead. ALVIN: Huh, no kidding. (DOORBELL RINGS) (SIGHS) I'm here for my son. EVELYN: No one is trying to take your son away from you, Herman. He came here, and we opened the door. ‐And then we called you. ‐HERMAN: Sandy, let's go. Bess. ‐This is such an honor. ‐You should have asked us first. This is our son. We are his parents. ‐We are his family. ‐I‐‐ I couldn't imagine‐‐ HERMAN: That what? That his mother and father might not want him to shame himself in front of the entire country by welcoming a vicious criminal? No one is a criminal. This is just a great opportunity. ‐For an opportunist. ‐EVELYN: Herman! Bess, this invitation came directly from the First Lady. Anne Lindbergh wants to meet our Sandy. To refuse the honor after your sister went out of her way‐‐ You must know why this is impossible. But this is the White House! HERMAN: I am not impressed by the White House. But it's the president. And I'm even less impressed with the man who lives there. ‐He's a Nazi. ‐Charles Lindbergh is a hero! He has saved thousands of lives. He has brought peace and prosperity‐‐ He's let Adolf Hitler walk across Europe, murdering thousands. But never mind the flyboy. Are you gonna stand there and tell me that Herr von Ribbentrop isn't a Nazi? ‐EVELYN: Oh, you are a coward! ‐BESS: Evelyn! ‐And you're dragging everyone down with you! ‐But not you, Evelyn. You're headed straight to the top. It may have taken you years to bang your way into this new role ‐as a great man's soon‐to‐be wife. ‐Mr. Levin. But now that you've made it, all the Nazis they want to parade through the White House are not gonna ruin it for you, are they? Enough, Evelyn. We're not important. We're ordinary people. ‐Come on. ‐EVELYN: Ordinary? Let go. ‐No, Sandy is extraordinary. ‐SANDY: Let go! HERMAN: Let's go. Come on, we're going home. ‐Bess. ‐You had no right. (DOOR CLOSES) HERMAN: Read about von Ribbentrop. Every dirty scheme Hitler has foisted on Europe, every filthy lie he has told other countries has come through the mouth of that man. Read. ‐Or listen to Winchell. ‐I don't care. HERMAN: Sandy, you know nothing about von Ribbentrop, about Goering, about Goebbels, about Himmler and Hess. I don't care. HERMAN: Do you know what the Treaty of Versailles is? Did you ever hear of Mein Kampf? Ask Mr. von Ribbentrop. He'll tell you. I'll never forgive you for this. BESS: But you will. One day, you will understand that what your father wants for you is actually what's for the best. I let my aunt down. She's the one who's let us down, Sandy! She's part of something dangerous and ugly. That's not true. That's bullshit! BESS: Stop it. Stop that talk right now. You're ghetto Jews. Narrow‐minded ghetto Jews. Don't mimic your stupid aunt. Don't ever talk back like that ever again! You're a dictator. You're worse than Hitler. BESS: Do you know what your father has done for you? Do you understand what you are going to do to your life? To your reputation? ♪ (PIANO PLAYS) ♪ ♪ (PIANO MUSIC CONTINUES) ♪ ♪ (PIANO STOPS) ♪ Oh. Does the jewelry bother you? I understand if seeing your wife's jewelry‐‐ Absolutely not.

We will soon be together on the other side of this terrible war in a moment of peace for Europe. May this understanding between our countries bring our people ever closer.
