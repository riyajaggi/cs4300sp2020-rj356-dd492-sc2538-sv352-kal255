 DON MCCORKLE: Master Philip, Don McCorkle, FBI. If you wouldn't mind, I'd like to ask you a few little questions. ♪ (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS) ♪ So, that shithead was an FBI agent. Tells me, "You're a red, you're a communist. You're marked." We are planning for the upcoming visit of Herr von Ribbentrop, the German minister. LIONEL BENGELSDORF: We would represent the U.S. Department of Interior at the dinner.

Herman, Lindbergh wants to meet our Sandy. -He's a Nazi. -Charles Lindbergh is a hero. You are a coward, and you're dragging everyone down with you! Now, we open the country to a permanent migration of Jewish families. To be clear, the Homestead Act involves voluntary participation -in the program, correct? -How could it be otherwise?

You finished your collections early. SANDY LEVIN: (DISTANTLY) Why are you always messing with my things? PHILIP LEVIN: Sandy, I didn't touch your things! What's the matter? ♪ (SOFT MUSIC PLAYS ON RADIO) ♪ SANDY: Stay on your side. Stay out of my stuff. PHILIP: I didn't do it. I didn't! SANDY: Then how else did this move over there? -When did you get this? -Yesterday. I tried to find out more before I rattled everyone, but... it seems to be real. The company's already signed off, so... This is my sister... and the rabbi. I'm no fool, this is just revenge. I saw Karl. He said the request that specified me came straight from the Newark office of the OAA. (THUNDER BOOMS) I don't know what we can do. -Hey, Dad. -Philip, go back upstairs. HERMAN LEVIN: Bess. He has a right to know. Philip, where's Sandy? In our room. HERMAN: Sandy! Come down. I gotta dry off. (TRUCK ENGINE RUMBLES) (WORKERS CLAMORING) Come on, Alvin, let's blow. -Settle, Shush. -Yeah, settle where? All the grifts and rackets in Philly or Camden or down in Atlantic City, and my uncle dumps us here with the spare change and broken pieces. ALVIN LEVIN: Yeah, to start. He tells us to show up and do whatever Mr. Schapp needs. So... we do as we're told. -SHUSHY MARGULIS: Pinball Billy Schapp. -Uh-huh. Who gives a goddamn about this shit? I need a sit-down with my uncle... You had a sit-down with your uncle, and he put us here. We're on the payroll. We have nowhere to go but up, so sit your own ass down and show some patience. Like Mack here. Hey, Mack, how long you been hauntin' this warehouse? -Eleven years. -See? That's not so long. I'll bet Mack gets promoted any day now. (LAUGHS) It's easy for you to make jokes, Alvin, but I had a good ride running numbers for Abie in Newark. I'd still be there if not for you. No, no... if not for Longy Zwillman, you mean. Wh... Can I help it if that asshole throws you over -just for knowing me? -It's not like I'm a red. Yeah, well, me neither, Shush. But I think that Lindy and Hitler are both shitbags, and that's close enough, ain't it? (PINBALL MACHINE CLANKS, DINGS) Sorry, Shush. You got dragged, too. (WORKERS CHATTERING) WOMAN: Grab the dolly and bring it around. Mack, you got a paperclip? Yeah, look over there. (MACHINES CLANKING) (WORKERS CHATTERING) -MAN 1: John Gaver... -(TOOLS CLANKING) MAN 2: Said after last year's Triple Crown, Eddie knows best. MAN 3: No, that truck's going to Delaware. Come on, move, guys. Where'd you learn that? I'm from Jersey. See these scratches? I'm not the first to pop this baby open. Come on, Shush. (THUNDER AND RAIN CONTINUE) It so happens that the Levin family has been selected to be participants in a new program, Homestead 42. Which is... (PAPER RUSTLING) "...designed to give us a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to move to a region of America previously inaccessible to city dwellers like us." And once there, chances are good that we will be able to afford to buy a place of our own, where you two will have separate bedrooms and a big backyard to play in. On the other hand, you will be changing schools. And we will be saying goodbye to Summit Avenue. Where are we moving to? Danville, Kentucky. It's the county seat of Boyle County. I know where that is. It's a town near where the Mawhinneys live. It's nice. It's quite a coincidence. Of all of the towns in all of America... What is the population of Danville? Uh, it is 6,700. And how many Jews... in Danville? Well, they don't provide that information, but... you already know, Bess. -Is there even a synagogue? -A synagogue? I'm sure there isn't a minyan. -They cannot just... -Boys. This is a big surprise, and we're all a little dumbfounded, so... Ask whatever's on your mind. BESS: And never mind Evelyn, I cannot believe the company would do this to you. With all the work that you have done for those people, all the hours you put in, the effort. It's not the company, Bess. They're not the ones that are forcing this. They aren't? They picked seven Jews. The entire government of the United States is leaning on them. The administration of a popular president is telling them to cooperate in a new program of national importance. You think a life insurance company can stand up to Charles A. Lindbergh, the big man in a little plane? BESS: We have rights. Yes, we do. I can quit my job. Short of that, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company does what the President of the United States asks. That's how this happens. Everyone is afraid. How could she? I lost my head with your sister and that goddamn rabbi. This is all to punish me. You were angry. Your son was being pulled away. I'll go see her... apologize. Don't you dare. You did nothing wrong. You will not apologize. Who do people in Kentucky root for? Excuse me? Dad and Sandy root for the Yankees. (HERMAN HUMMING) I like the Dodgers, but we could also be Giants fans. What's the team in Kentucky? Seldon, you hungry? Can I get you something for breakfast? Oh, I just ate earlier downstairs. Thank you. Philip, I'll wait for you -on the stairs, okay? -Mm. (DOOR OPENS) -Morning, Seldon. -SELDON WISHNOW: Good morning. Dad, who do they root for in Kentucky? Uh, baseball? Um... Cubs or Cardinals, probably. Maybe the White Sox. They're all in Kentucky? No, they're all a couple states away. It's the best they can do. -What's the Klan? -Excuse me? The Cooducks Klan? Ku Klux Klan. Yeah. That. Are they in Kentucky? -No. -Yes. They are. They are in Kentucky and Ohio and Indiana and Missouri -and all over that part of the country. -Bess. What are they? HERMAN: They are a group that doesn't like Negroes or Jews or even Catholics. They, uh... They're certified idiots that you don't need to worry about, Philip. PHILIP: But if we move to Kentucky... Eat your breakfast, Philip. I don't want to go. Why can't we stay here? Because the company is transferring your father. Why? Did you do something wrong? -No. -SANDY: Such a baby. It's just a part of working for a big company like Metropolitan Life. Well, it's wrong. Yes, because everything right with America is right here in Newark, New Jersey, and everything wrong is somewhere else. Ignore him, Philip. Until your brother learns to be civil, we will just continue to ignore him. -MAN 1: Come on! -(TRUCK RUMBLING) (WORKERS CLAMORING) MAN 1: Okay, stop. ALVIN: No, there he is. Don't say anything stupid. You got a minute, Mr. Schapp? What can I do for ya, kid? Uh, we're hopin' to do for you. Uh, Shushy and me, we just went to six of your bars, um... South Philly, West Philly, Center City... And I'm paying you for this? (CHUCKLES) Uh... maybe. But that's up to you. Shush? -I've seen one before. -Look at the keyhole. No, look. You see those little scratches? So what? They're from the key. No, the key doesn't make marks like that. (MAN 2 LAUGHING) WOMAN 1: Sorry, Mrs. Lewis isn't available. May I take a message? WOMAN 2: I got it. WOMAN 3: (LAUGHS) Come on. What are you telling me? You're leakin' silver. MINNA SCHAPP: Papa, I found those invoices -that you need... -Minna. WOMAN 4: Got a phone call for ya! (MAN 2 LAUGHING) Meet the smart little macher from Jersey who's telling your old man he's being robbed. Alvin... -Levin. Uh, sorry. (CHUCKLES) -Minna. Pleasure. WOMAN 5: Phone call for you! Phone call. (WORKERS SHOUTING, CLAMORING) BESS: I apologize. Bess, you have said nothing for which you need to apologize. Herman was understandably angry. He was, but that's of little moment to what's happening. Bess, we haven't gone to the trouble of recommending the Levins for Homestead because of any dispute between us. I'm not so petty as that, and neither is your sister. ♪ (SOFT PIANO MUSIC PLAYING) ♪ Please. Don't do this. Herman has worked a long time in New Jersey, working his way up at Metropolitan Life, he knows these neighborhoods, he has regular clients. -Bess. -And our boys are happy at their school. They've come up year after year with the same classmates. -Please, Bess... -And when we are gone, Evelyn will regret this. As angry and hurt as she is now, she will have sent away her only sister and her nephews, who she loves and who love her. And there will be no way to repair... Bess, your sister realizes that this is an opportunity. You will not be set back in the slightest. You'll be given a government stipend to cover the cost of the move, and with Herman's salary intact, the cost of housing and other living expenses are such in Kentucky that you will soon be homeowners and saving off your every paycheck. We have enough money. And the personal growth inherent in getting your children out of the insulated culture of Weequahic? Insulated? -We are Jews. -As am I. We are comfortable living among other Jews. And I am comfortable living anywhere in this country with anyone. And isn't that... the purpose of this program? In fact, isn't that the essence of the American experiment? Our family is an experiment to you, Rabbi? Sit. Bess... Your family was also selected because Herman has come to the attention of law enforcement for sheltering a young man who went overseas in violation of the neutrality laws. Now, this move... will do much to mollify the FBI and their current concern about the Levins. It's true, Bess. In so... many ways, what is happening here is for your own good. And in three months... you will be writing your sister from Kentucky to thank her for opening a new world to you. You will see. Above all, you and your children are always welcome in my home anytime. In fact, Evelyn and I hope to see you all at the wedding. And my husband? RABBI LIONEL BENGELSDORF: I'm sure he and I will speak again. -♪ (MUSIC CONTINUES) ♪ -(CLOCK TICKING) (CARS HONK) WOMAN: I'll meet you wherever you wanna go... MAN: ...the place just right around the corner. (CAR HONKS) (COMMUTERS CHATTERING) -WOMAN 1: You're gonna need some form of identification. -(PHONES RINGING) -(EMPLOYEES CHATTER) -(TYPEWRITERS CLACKING) -Looks good. -Thank you. WOMAN 2: Yes, Mr. Elia. Right, I understand what you're saying... WOMAN 1: ...because we don't have enough information. WOMAN 2: But we need to have the documents. -(EVELYN FINKEL MUTTERING) -PHILIP: Aunt Evelyn! (GASPS) Oh my God, Philip! I am so happy to see you. This is Leroy. This is my nephew Philip. Pleased to meet you. -I'll take care of this. -Okay. Let me look at you. You have grown at least an inch. Did you come from school. Is your mom with you? I came by myself. On the bus. All the way downtown? I'm impressed. Come on. Let me show you this way into my office. -(PHONE RINGS) -WOMAN 3: Got it. EVELYN: In here. Can you keep a secret? Oh. Yes! I went alone to the Newsreel Theatre to see you at the White House. What was it like to eat dinner with the president? Well... This is the reception line. On your way to a state dinner, the guests file past the president and the first lady, and when you're introduced, they photograph you, and then the White House sends this to you. -WOMAN 4: Russ! Line two. -(EVELYN GIGGLES) Did the president say anything? He said, "It's very nice to have you here." Did you say anything back? I said, "It's an honor, Mr. President." I saw you dancing in the newsreel. Yes, I did dance. Evelyn Finkel of Dewey Street at the White House. (CHUCKLES) Isn't it unbelievable? Sure is. Aunt Evelyn... Do you know that we're moving to Kentucky? Uh-huh. No thanks. I don't want to go, Aunt Evelyn. I wanna stay at my school. Who sent you here, Philip? Sent me? Nobody. You can tell me the truth. Nobody sent me. Can't Seldon and his mother go instead of us? Seldon? Is that the boy from downstairs? His father died. His father also worked for the Metropolitan Life until he got sick. And now, his mother works there, too. How come we have to go to Kentucky and they don't? Did you father send you here, Philip? Nobody evens knows I'm here. Please send Seldon to Kentucky and not us. Philip... (SIGHS) you can't go through life being afraid of things that are unfamiliar to you. I mean, suppose I'd been afraid of going to the White House or of meeting the foreign minister? Hey. I don't want you to grow up and be frightened like your parents. You won't do that, will you? You promise me you won't? -Not you, huh, Marty? -Not me. And it's not like I'm foolin' anyone with the last name of Lefkowitz. So, who did I piss off? -Montana? -(MARTY LEFKOWITZ SIGHS) -You're kidding me. -Missoula, Montana. Compared to that, Kentucky's gonna feel like you're working the Manhattan office. This is so fucked up. How does a government tell a private company where to send its employees based on their religion? FREDERICK: It's no help to Met Life. Who's gonna do a better job of selling and collecting on policies to Jewish families than you guys? Or the colored? You guys do better in the colored neighborhoods than anyone. I'm sure the cowboys in Missoula will love Sy Hershberg making his home where the buffalo roam. (CHUCKLING) EVELYN: I almost forgot, I have a treat for you. It's an after-dinner chocolate, a chocolate wrapped in gold paper. And see what's on it? That's the presidential seal. It's what's waiting for you on the tables at the White House. When I saw it, I thought, "Who is the boy I wanna make most happy in the whole world?" Here. (HORNS HONKING) (EVELYN SIGHS) Seldon's last name is Wishnow, right? -That's right. -And he's your best friend? -MAN 1: What'd he say? -MAN 2: He said one more week. (MUFFLED CONVERSATION CONTINUES) -(SHOWER KNOBS SQUEAK) -(WATER POURS) ♪ (MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO) ♪ (GRUNTS) You sure you don't got the shell shock? (CHUCKLES, COUGHS) My dad got it from the war. Ma said he was never right in the head again. Head's fine, Shush. It's my leg. I don't know, Alvin. I saw ya eyeballin' that little mouse. -That mouse? -Yeah. You're talking about the boss' daughter. I don't care if she's Pharaoh's daughter, she's not for me. Besides, you already made a splash with that thing -about the coinboxes. -(SHUSHING) Trust me, Shush. -I know what I'm doin'. (LAUGHS) -(SHUSHY GROANS) Damn! (WINCES) All that walkin' yesterday broke down the fucking stump again. (WINCES, CHUCKLES) I sure miss Philip. He figured out how to wrap the bandage so tight. Better than the Canadian nurses ever fucking did. That little pisher. (SHUSHY CHUCKLES) (NEIGHBORS ARGUING DISTANTLY) DEPUTY SECRETARY: Please justify the increased spending on the considerable resources it took to move them... Secretary, apologies. The trains are all delayed this morning, a problem on the tracks in Baltimore. DEPUTY SECRETARY: Not to worry, Rabbi. We tabled the reports on Just Folks and Homestead until you arrived, and Mr. Stedman here was just concluding the quarterly reports on Park Service and Fish and Wildlife. I'll just conclude by referring everyone to the quarterly status reports, uh, for licensing and parkgoing, which show us as staying in the black through the third quarter. -ALL: Here, here. -(THUMPING) Rabbi, you have the floor. BENGELSDORF: Well, I won't waste anyone's time -on what is working well... -(CHUCKLING) because what is working well requires considerably less attention, and the Just Folks program is a national success. Voluntary participation now involves more than 8,000 teenage boys in 34 states, and the numbers are growing. This summer, we may see increased enrollment of more than 50 percent. City youth are being connected to the values and authenticity of the heartland. -ALL: Cheers. -(THUMPING) On the other hand, I would be remiss if I claimed that Homestead 42, as the second phase of the president's initiative to absorb American Jewry into the mainstream, has found similar favor. -There are problems? -There are. The fact that the program is not truly voluntary has led to some considerable dissent. This was anticipated. We sought to overcome any skepticism by ensuring that the transfers came with fundamental economic incentives, but thus far, what Congress has approved is only a stipend to cover the cost of the moving. Salary increases for transferred families were omitted from the bill... HENRY FORD: We can hardly expect a Republican Congress to pass legislation that has government mandating raises for private employees just because their companies transfer them to different posts. -MAN 1: Right. -BENGELSDORF: But without that... And speaking as a businessman, I can hardly expect private companies to pay employees more for doing the same jobs at new locations. But Secretary Ford, sir, absent an actual economic incentive, what we are then asking of these families is to accept an involuntary transfer to another city or town with no benefit to them. Involuntary in what sense? Well, we're moving them and they get nothing, save for the fact that their salaries go a little further in more rural economies. Well, that's meaningful. -Secretary, sir, I was told... -Rabbi. When I build an auto plant, -I build it where I want. -MAN 2: Right. And if the workers want those jobs, they come to my plant. Or they don't. Now, if the Jewish people want to keep these jobs, they have the opportunity to move to where the jobs will now be. Or not. That seems voluntary to me. (ALL MUTTER) (THUMPING) (WORKERS CHATTERING) ALVIN: I'm telling you, this guy's right hand... -SHUSHY: (SCOFFS) Go on. -MINNA: Hey, Mack. These? -MACK: Yeah, that's all of 'em. -Yeah? ALVIN: No, no, no, I got it! -I got it, I got it, I got it. -What? -Oh. -ALVIN: Uh... -Where's it go? (CHUCKLES) -To the, uh, the office. -Yeah. -(CHUCKLES) Thanks. Oh, geez. Are you okay with that? I'm fine. It's just every now and then... (GRUNTS) ...I just forget that I'm a cripple. Oh. I don't think you're a cripple. -Oh. That's sweet. -(MINNA CHUCKLES) But, um... when my stump breaks down, I'm a cripple. MINNA: What do you mean it breaks down? -ALVIN: Uh... -What... You... you got it? ALVIN: Yeah, yeah, no, I got it. Uh... Every now and then, if I overdo things, it gets swole, and then the... prosthetic doesn't fit right, and then it gets more swole, and it's just... -'round and 'round like that. -Yeah. Yeah. You... You should soak your stump in Epsom salt. It makes the skin tough. -Yeah. -ALVIN: Epsom salt. WOMAN: I'm gonna go to the power room. MAN: These are a little bit higher. BESS: Boys not home from school yet? School just let out. BESS: My bus must've been early. Bess. Where exactly is the company sending you in Kentucky? -Danville, near Lexington. -Danville... In today's mail. Why would they send two of us to the same little town in Kentucky? Why send me at all? I'm not a Met Life agent. My husband was. I'm drawing on his pension and insurance and working part-time in the regional office. Why bother with me at all? -(DOG BARKING) -(NEIGHBORS CHATTING, LAUGHING) The one thing I can think, the one blessing, is that Seldon and Philip will still get to be together. At least there's that. The first thing will be to apply for an injunction in U.S. District Court to see if we can stop the transfers while the case is adjudicated. Because that will take a while. What are our chances? Well, better if we go in with plaintiffs from a variety of New Jersey corporations. You three will be suing for relief from Met Life, but I'd like to dig up plaintiffs from Hess Oil, Prudential, as many of the other companies that are cooperating with the OAA. How long might that take? Give me a week before I file. If we sue, can Met Life go hard at us? Could we be fired? I can't prevent your company from being punitive if they want to be punitive. In the event that we prevail in court, they would be liable for damages if they go that way. If we prevail. Any lawyer who claims a guaranteed outcome in a civil action is a liar, Mr. Levin. I'm out. -(PHONE RINGS) -(WORKERS CHATTERING) I'm in. Fuck Montana. In. This is still America, and I want my day in court. HERMAN: Glad you're with me, Sy. AGENT MCCORKLE: Levin. What now? You've failed to contact the OAA field office and confirm your transfer plans. If you want to keep your job at Met Life, the deadline's this week. Why wait? I dunno. Keeps slipping my mind. How's your nephew doing? We haven't seen him around lately. -Limping right along, I'm sure. -We done here? MCCORKLE: Have a fine evening. But if I was you... I'd save the time and money taking things to court, and I'd report to OAA. (CAR ENGINE IGNITES) BESS: Sandy. Is Philip with you? No, he's outside playing. Good. I wanted to talk to you alone. What did I do now? You knew your aunt was sending us to Kentucky. You knew before your father even opened that letter. Don't lie to me, I know you knew. I'm not lying to you. Okay. But you did know, right? Aunt Ev said it was for own good, that she was protecting us. Protecting us from what? She said we were already in enough trouble from the government. Because of Alvin, because of him coming to live with us after being in the war. And what did you tell her? Did you tell her Seldon is Philip's friend? No, I... I don't think Philip even likes Seldon all that much. Well, someone said something because now the company is transferring the Wishnows to Danville as well. Mom, it wasn't me. So... We've started modifying the coin boxes. And at some cost. Meaning I hope you're right, and I hope like hell I see a profit. I am, and you will. Is that all you're gonna do? What do you mean, kid? ALVIN: Well, they've been robbing you for years. So they should all pay. Jack up the price. A Lincoln per pinball and vending machine, a Hamilton on each slot. Ain't that easy, kid. I raise the rent, and they'll kick up a stink. Then make an example of one of them. I'm not into rough stuff. And if I go to Margulis and cry help, he'll have to get the okay from Waxey Gordon. And then, both of them will take a bite out of my ass for making it happen. That's how things work. Just point to the mutt with the loudest mouth. Me and Shush'll do the rest. My take goes up, I still gotta ante up to Margulis and Gordon. Yeah, but now, you got the whole pie, so how you slice it is up to you. Farshteyn? You don't rattle, kid. Let me give it a little thought. I see you sniffin' around my daughter. ALVIN: Is that a problem? You got intentions? It's too soon to know. WALTER WINCHELL: Well, that's it for now from the editorial room of the Jergens Journal and yours truly, Walter Winchell. -(RADIO TURNS OFF) -That's a month. And not one word about Homestead 42. God, I hope they haven't bought him off. I'm sure they haven't. He still attacked Lindbergh and Wheeler. Yeah, I know, but still. What are you doing? I'm gonna write to him. Tell him we need him to speak out. I mean, the government telling companies where people of this race, that religion, where they can and can't work? You let them get away with that, what's next? That's how fascism works. You're sitting there, writing to Winchell? -Walter Winchell? -(AGGRESSIVELY) Yes, I am! And you're predicting that these people will stop at nothing once they know what they can get away with, and yet, you don't think they can do what they want to the mail? Come on, Bess, it's one letter. It's not just one letter. You're also planning to sue the government. As you said, we have rights. How can you see what these people are and have so little sense of what they are capable of? We have already had FBI agents harassing us, we have had our children questioned! Let someone else write to Winchell. Someone else? -The next guy? -Yeah. Let the next guy step up. And I just sit here on my ass? Keeping quiet, waiting for the worst to happen? No. I don't see Shepsie sitting around writing letters, waiting for the worst to happen. -Not Canada again. -Yes, Canada. This is my country! Not anymore! It is Lindbergh's. It is the Jew haters'. It is the America Firsters'. It is the people who chase children down the street, asking questions, and then deport their families to Kentucky. It's their country. And if we run? If we quit? Then they win. And they do not get to win. -Herman. -We have done nothing wrong. (DOOR OPENS) Mrs. Lindbergh. I just wanted to congratulate you personally, as the president and I will regrettably not be there on the day. Oh, so kind... As it happens, we'll be flying down to Caracas that week for the Pan-American Conferences, but it was kind of you to favor us with an invitation. Oh, not at all. You both have our very best wishes. Rabbi, I'm sure we will talk further. I'm sure. Thank you. Thank you. (WHISPERING) Thank you. (CLOCK CHIMING MUSICALLY) Well, that was unexpected. Yes, when she heard you were outside, she wanted to give her regrets personally. Oh, so kind. She's so gracious. -Mm-hmm. -And did you see the president? I did not, but as you can surmise, I had a good bit of time with the First Lady. And as I suspected, the opportunity to push more funding through Congress will have to wait until after the midterm elections. What would appear to be salary bonuses for relocating Jewish citizens are... for rather obvious reasons, politically untenable before then. But the promise I made to people will be kept. I am assured. MAURICE SILVERMAN: As you know, we applied for an injunction in US District Court. Unfortunately, we were denied. But, as we drew a conservative judge, I saw merit in immediately appealing to the Third Circuit. How long will the appeal take? SILVERMAN: I will do what I can to expedite on my end, but the reality is, at least a year. -(WORKERS CHATTERING) -(PHONE RINGS) There's only so much I can bring on this first trip down. Once you're settled, we can send the things you don't have room for. Or, when we come, we can bring some of your things. I suspect Herman's going to hire a moving company. Herman's made the decision? Not yet. But for all his years at Metropolitan Life, I don't see him walking away. And you? What do you think? What do I think? Does it matter what I think? More and more, he yells. He doesn't talk. If he wants to fight, he fights, and if he wants to quit, he quits. NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER: And the powerful Russian offense pushes back against the German assault on the Crimea. Finally, the Russians learned how to fight. They stopped them outside of Moscow in December. -Remember that? -That was the winter. SHEPSIE TIRSCHWELL: Either way... the Russians are the only ones making it hard on Hitler. The British, too, in Egypt. It's a sideshow. That's a couple of divisions running around the desert. The Russians are making the bastards bleed. Thank God. ANNOUNCER: ...and back beyond the invasion's starting line of three years ago. Herman, we gotta get outta here. All of us. ANNOUNCER: The Soviet Separate Coastal Army sweeps in and takes back the ancient city of Kerch. You sure you got enough room? Car's already packed to the brim. You, Estelle, and the kids need to fit in there somewhere. We'll manage. Oh, Herman. Uh, Benjamin here's gonna be taking over for me. Happy to meet ya. Can I, uh, give you a hand? No, no, no. You stay and mind the store. ANNOUNCER: Marching in this haul here are Germans and Romanians. They surrender easily and completely, with their weapons... So. Winnipeg. Yeah, it's quite a trek. Estelle is putting the youngest in his pajamas so we can drive right through the first night, get over the border before we stop. My brother says Winnipeg's nice. He's an idiot, but that's what he says. Seriously, though, Herman... you gotta think about things. If you go to Kentucky, you don't know what you're getting into. And if you don't go, if you refuse... Then the Cossacks come for me. They came. When Alvin was staying with you, didn't they? They questioned you, the kids. They leaned on your brother until Alvin was gone. Yes, Herman, there are Cossacks. There are. They're out there. Travel safe, friend. Next year, in Jerusalem. -Or Saskatchewan. -You mean Manitoba. Nu, there's a difference? (CAR ENGINE IGNITES) REBECCA: Oh. (GIGGLING) Can I see? SANDY: (CHUCKLING) No, not yet. (DOG BARKING) REBECCA: You're so serious. (PENCIL SCRATCHING) Look. Wow. This is...

(SIGHS) No. WINCHELL: Good evening, Mr. and Mrs. America, and all the ships at sea. -Let's go to press. -(TELEGRAM PULSES) Flash. The phony moniker for phase one of organized Jewish persecution in the land of the free is Homestead 42. -Give 'em hell, Walter. -Aided and abetted by the most respectable of America's robber barons. Item: 225 Jewish families have been told to vacate their homes in America's northeast cities in order to be shipped hundreds of miles from family and friends. This first shipment has been kept strategically small so as to escape national attention. Why? Because it marks the beginning of second-class citizenship, if not outright persecution, for the four and a half million American citizens of Jewish descent. That lying prick. How can you listen to that shit? -This is the great US of A... -Not in this house! ...instituting illegal actions against its natural-born and naturalized citizens. And who's next, Mr. and Mrs. America, now that the Bill of Rights is no longer the law of the land? And who's next under the Wheeler-Ford plan for government-funded removals? The long-suffering Negroes? The hard-working Italians? The last of the Mohicans? -Stay with me... -Good night, Mr. Winchell, and good luck finding a new career. EVELYN: Why do you say so? Because that guttersnipe just accused me of persecuting my own people, of making them second-class citizens. Well, he didn't name you. He slandered my program. EVELYN: Well, what are you gonna do? Well, it's been a while since I've written a sermon from scratch, but at this moment... I feel the fire. A sermon? For Saturday? For tomorrow. And a newspaper page is going to be my pulpit.

At ten o'clock, the controversial radio personality and presidential hopeful Walter Winchell took to a makeshift stage for his fourth campaign speech and repeated the need to take back America, thus provoking his hundreds of supporters in attendance to lash out at the small group of residents peacefully observing from the outskirts of the crowd. Dozens from both sides are injured, and one man has died from his injuries. The mayor has enforced a curfew, which is largely being ignored, as reports of escalating violence, rock throwing, window breaking, and fires perpetuated by Winchell's mob continue to multiply within Paterson city limits. A downtown hardware store owner told police earlier today that several men wearing Winchell buttons bought handsaws, ice picks, and hammers. When another group entered to make similar purchases, the owner called the police. We return you now to this hour's program. ♪ (MUSIC PLAYS) ♪ (EVELYN SIGHS) You... You can't do this. Not to us.
