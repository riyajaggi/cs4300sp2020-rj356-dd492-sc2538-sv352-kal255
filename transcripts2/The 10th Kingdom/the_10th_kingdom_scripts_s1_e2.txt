 WELL, THAT EXPLAINS IT. IT EXPLAINS NOTHING. WHY HAS THE PRINCE MADE NO REFERENCE TO THE TROLL KING CRISIS? WELL, PERHAPS HE HASN'T HEARD ABOUT IT. A TWISTED ANKLE CAN BE EXCRUCIATING. THE TROLL KING HAS CHALLENGED WENDELL TO FACE HIM IN COMBAT. MEANWHILE, HE'S BEEN KILLING FOURTH KINGDOM CITIZENS AND NOTHING'S BEING DONE ABOUT IT. WE NEED A PLAN. WE HAVE A PLAN. MY SEATING PLAN. THE CEREMONY

 IS BARELY THREE WEEKS AWAY. I NEED THE PRINCE FOR A FITTING AND I NEED PEOPLE TO AT LEAST COMMIT TO A BASIC COLOR SCHEME. I'M WORRIED ABOUT WENDELL. I SHALL GO TO THE HUNTING LODGE BY THE FASTEST STEED IN THE KINGDOM AND TELL HIM OF THE TROLL KING'S CHALLENGE. JOLLY GOOD IDEA. ONE FURTHER THING... THE QUEEN IS STILL AT LARGE. SHE HAS SPIES EVERYWHERE. NOTHING THAT IS SAID HERE MUST GO BEYOND THIS ROOM. AGREED? AGREED. WE MUST CONSIDER MILITARY OPTIONS OTHERWISE, WE WILL BE PERCEIVED AS BEING SPINELESS IN WENDELL'S ABSENCE. WOULD IT HELP TO... SUMMON MY HUNTSMAN. OH, WE HAVE PROBLEMS. WENDELL'S COUNCIL DOESN'T BELIEVE MY LETTER. THEY HAVE SENT A MAN TO WENDELL'S HUNTING LODGE. HE MUST NOT RETURN. IT WILL BE DONE. IF YOU WERE KIDNAPPED IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ALL RIGHT BUT VIRGINIA? OH, HAVE I LOST MY ONE TRUE LOVE? OH, STOP IT WITH THE ONE TRUE LOVE. YOU'RE SOME GRUBBY EX-CON. YOU'VE BEEN NOTHING BUT TROUBLE SINCE WE MET. DON'T TALK TO ME LIKE THAT! I'LL BITE YOU IN A MINUTE! DO YOU WANT TO DANCE WITH ME? BECAUSE I'VE HAD... SHH, SHH, SHH. LISTEN. ( whooshing ) ( whooshing ) HALT. WHO APPROACHES? FORGIVE US, NOBLE WOODSMAN BUT HAVE YOU SEEN A GORGEOUS GIRL WITH VERY LONG HAIR? I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING. I'M BLIND. ( whooshing ) A BLIND WOODSMAN? HAVE YOU EVER SEEN A TREE MOVE? TONY. WHAT? LOOK AT HIS AXE. IS THAT AXE, BY ANY REMOTE CHANCE THE MAGIC AXE THAT CUTS THROUGH ANYTHING? COULD BE. OH. HOW MUCH DO YOU WANT FOR IT? YEAH, HOW MUCH? OH, YOU CAN HAVE MY MAGIC AXE IF YOU CAN GUESS MY NAME BUT YOUR FRIEND MUST KNEEL BY THIS BLOCK AND IF YOU HAVEN'T FOUND MY NAME OUT BY THE TIME I'VE CHOPPED ALL THESE LOGS INTO FIREWOOD I WILL HAVE HIS HEAD. WHAT IS IT WITH YOU PEOPLE? WHAT KIND OF TWISTED UPBRINGING DID YOU HAVE? WHY CAN'T YOU JUST SAY, "OH, THAT'LL BE 100 GOLD COINS." WHY DOES IT ALWAYS HAVE TO BE "NO, NOT UNLESS YOU LAY A MAGIC EGG OR COUNT THE HAIRS ON THAT GIANT'S ASS"?! DO YOU WANT THE AXE OR DON'T YOU? YEAH, WELL, LET'S JUST CARRY ON LOOKING FOR VIRGINIA. OH! I KNOW THIS. IT'S ALL RIGHT, IT'S ALL RIGHT. WE ACCEPT. DON'T ACCEPT ON MY BEHALF. OH, NO, IT'S FINE. NO... IT'S OKAY, IT'S OKAY. I SWEAR, IT'S OKAY. VERY WELL. LAY YOUR HEAD ON THE BLOCK WHILE YOUR FRIEND GUESSES. JUST FOR VIRGINIA. YES, DON'T WORRY. JUST TO MAKE YOU SECURE. I KNOW THIS. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT AT ALL. ALL RIGHT, MR. I- DON'T-HAVE-TO-LOOK- BUT-I-CAN-CHOP-WOOD YOUR NAME IS RUMPELSTILTSKIN. NO. OH! I SAID "RUMPELSTILTSKIN." IT'S NOT HIS NAME. GUESS AGAIN. OH, RUMPELSTILTSKIN, JR. RUMPELSTILTSKIN THE FOURTH. NO. ( whooshing ) DOES IT HAVE A RUMPEL IN IT? Virginia: PLEASE LET ME GO. I'M NOT INVOLVED IN THIS. WHERE'S THE DOG? I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. DON'T MAKE ME ASK AGAIN. I THINK HE'S DEAD. I THINK YOU'RE LYING. AND YOU'RE NOT LYING. IS HE HURT? YOU WERE DRAGGING SOMETHING ON WHEELS. YET THE TRACKS WERE TOO DEEP FOR THE WEIGHT OF JUST A DOG. WHAT ABOUT THE OTHERS? WILL THEY COME LOOKING FOR YOU? THEY DON'T GIVE A DAMN ABOUT ME. SO THEY WILL COME. DO THEY HAVE ANY WEAPONS? YES. NO WEAPONS. UH... TOM. UH, DICK. VAN DYKE. COLD. UH... UM. OH! ELVIS? FRANKIE. JOHN, PAUL, GEORGE. RINGO. RINGO? COLDER. WAY OFF. WELL, COME ON, LOOK, LOOK. JUST GIVE ME A CLUE. WHAT KIND OF FUN CAN IT BE JUST TO KILL HIM? QUITE A LOT OF FUN ACTUALLY. IN FACT, YOU COULD SAY THAT IS THE REASON FOR MY EXISTENCE. SIT. I WAS BORN HERE IN THIS FOREST. WHEN I FIRST SAW THE QUEEN I WAS STILL A FORESTER. SHE CAME TO MY VILLAGE. SHE STOPPED HER HUNTING PARTY TO WATER THE HORSES. THEN SHE CALLED ME FORWARD AND SHOWED ME THIS. SHE SAID "WHEN THIS CROSSBOW IS FIRED, THE BOLT WILL NOT STOP "UNTIL IT HITS THE HEART OF A LIVING BEING. IT CANNOT MISS." SO I SAID "WHAT MUST I DO TO WIN THIS MAGIC CROSSBOW?" AND SHE SAID, "JUST CLOSE YOUR EYES FIRE WHEREVER YOU WISH AND IT'LL BE YOURS." SO I DID. THE BOLT LEFT THE BOW LIKE GOSSAMER AND SPED A MILE THROUGH THE TREES THEN KILLED A CHILD WHO WAS PLAYING. I REMEMBER THE QUEEN'S FACE AS I PULLED THE BOLT FROM MY SON'S HEART. AND SHE SAID "YOU WILL BE MY HUNTSMAN." SO YOU UNDERSTAND. THE HUNT IS MY PURPOSE AND ONLY PLEASURE. I HAVE NO INTEREST IN MERCY. OH! WELL, HOW DO WE KNOW YOU'RE NOT LYING ABOUT YOUR NAME? HEY! THAT'S RIGHT. I COULD HAVE SAID IT ALREADY. YOU HAVEN'T GUESSED MY NAME... NOT BY A LONG WAY. LONG WAY. MY NAME... IS IN MY HAT. ( no audio ) I MAY BE BLIND BUT MY HEARING IS EXCELLENT. MOVE ANY CLOSER... AND I CHOP YOUR FRIEND'S HEAD OFF. OH... OH... YOU'RE A SICK PERVERT, HUH? YOU'VE DONE THIS BEFORE. HUNDREDS OF TIMES. AND, UH... APPROXIMATELY WHAT WAS THE PERCENTAGE OF CORRECT GUESSES? NO ONE HAS EVER GUESSED. OH! YOUR MAJESTY? ARE YOU THERE? ( horse whickers ) HELLO? IS ANYONE THERE? ( high-pitched whine ) PRINCE WENDELL? WHO IS THIS QUEEN? HOW CAN YOU SERVE SOMEONE THAT MADE YOU KILL YOUR OWN SON? IT WAS MY DESTINY TO KILL MY SON. IT WAS HER DESTINY TO ASK ME. YOU'RE CRAZY. EVERYBODY IN THIS WHOLE PLACE IS CRAZY! WHATEVER IS MEANT TO HAPPEN WILL HAPPEN NO MATTER WHAT WE DO. IT IS MY DESTINY TO KILL YOU NOW. WHO ARE YOU? I'M NOBODY. I SWEAR, I'M NOBODY. I WILL KILL YOU. ( clanging ) I HAVE A LITTLE BUSINESS TO ATTEND TO. WE WILL CONTINUE OUR DISCUSSION LATER. "THE MAD AXEMAN." ( growls ) I TOLD YOU YOU'D NEVER GUESS. OH, UM... UH... UH, WAIT! UH, UM... Wolf: OH, HURRY UP. IT'S FORMING IN MY MIND. RUNNING OUT OF LOGS. UM, UH... JUST A SECOND. IT'S COMING, IT'S COMING. TOO LATE. NOW, I WILL HAVE YOUR FRIEND'S HEAD. ( Wolf yells ) JUST A MINUTE... JULIET! ( groans ) ( horse neighs ) ( Virginia grunting ) ( breathing heavily ) HI. BECAUSE YOU HELPED US, WE WILL HELP YOU AGAIN BUT THIS REALLY HAS TO BE THE LAST TIME. YOU'RE SUCH A LOT OF TROUBLE. OKAY. PLEASE GO AND FIND MY FATHER AND WOLF AND TELL THEM WHERE I AM. TELL THEM TO COME AND GET ME. BYE. Wolf: AH, WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT? JULIET, THE AXEMAN! YOU KNOW WHAT? IS IT ANY WONDER HE TURNED INTO A SICK SADIST? I KNOW. PSST... YOU, DOWN THERE. IT'S ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE BIRDS. I KNOW WHERE VIRGINIA IS. WHERE? SHE'S IN A TREE THAT IS NOT A TREE... IN A PLACE THAT IS NOT A PLACE. ALL RIGHT, HOLD-HOLD-HOLD IT. CAN WE JUST STOP WITH THE RHYMING CRAP? TAKE US THERE! OH! OH, COME ON! MOVE! SHE'S INSIDE THIS TREE. BYE. WAIT A MINUTE. INSIDE A TREE? HOW COULD SHE BE INSIDE A TREE? VIRGINIA! VIRGINIA! ARE YOU UP THERE? WOLF? WOLF? OH... IT'S HER. IT'S HER. UM, HOW DO WE GET IN? THERE'S A DOOR. UM, ALL RIGHT. A DOOR? UM.... A DOOR? WHERE? I DON'T SEE A DOOR. I DON'T SEE A DOOR. THERE'S NO DOOR. THERE'S DEFINITELY NO DOOR! OH, IF HE'S CONCEALED IT WITH MAGIC IT COULD TAKE WEEKS TO OPEN! WHY CAN'T YOU JUST COME DOWN-- LET US IN FROM THE INSIDE? WELL... HE'S CHAINED ME UP. I CAN'T. CAN'T YOU CLIMB UP THE TREE? WELL, THERE ARE NO FOOTHOLDS. WELL, GET A LADDER OR SOMETHING. WHERE AM I GOING TO GET A LADDER? HOLD ON A SECOND. IF THIS IS A MAGIC AXE MAYBE I CAN CHOP THE TREE DOWN! VIRGINIA, CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION? WHAT? HOW LONG IS YOUR HAIR NOW? UH, IT'S, UH, LONGER THAN EVER. IT'S... NO. NO! THAT'S A GREAT IDEA. NO! I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO SAY THIS. LOVE OF MY LIFE LET DOWN YOUR LUSTROUS LOCKS. OW! ( grunting ) OW! LOOK OUT BELOW.

( yells ) SORRY. WILL SOMEBODY MOVE THIS DOOR? MY ARM IS SQUASHED! VIRGINIA, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? YES. WHAT IS THIS PLACE? IT'S A BAD PLACE! LET'S GO. GOOD IDEA. OH, WAIT, WE CAN'T JUST LEAVE HIM LIKE THIS. YOU'RE RIGHT. GIVE ME THE AXE. I'LL DO IT. WAIT! WE CAN'T KILL HIM. OF COURSE WE CAN. HE'D KILL US. HE'S HELPLESS. EXACTLY WHY WE SHOULD KILL HIM NOW! WOLF, NO! HE'S GOING TO COME AFTER US. I DON'T CARE. WE'RE NOT KILLING HIM. ( grunts ) YOU'RE GOING TO REGRET THIS MOMENT. COME ON. AW! ( delighted laughter ) HEY, BOY, WELCOME BACK. TIME FOR WALKIES. OH, HEY. HOW DID THE HAIRCUT GO? WELL... UH... I THINK I MIGHT HAVE OVERDONE THE AXE TRIM A LITTLE. WH...? I DON'T... WHAT'S...? DON'T SAY A WORD. OH, MY... W-WHAT...? ( yelling and screaming ) WHAT DO YOU WANT? YOU ARE INVITING TROUBLE. I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING... WAR IS GREAT FUN WHEN THERE'S NO ENEMY. YOU'RE VERY STUPID. EVEN FOR A TROLL. WENDELL'S KINGDOM BORDERS ALL THE OTHERS. THEY WILL NOT LET IT FALL WITHOUT A FIGHT. THE OTHER KINGDOMS WILL SEND IN TROOPS AND CRUSH YOU! THEN I'LL KILL THEM ALL. I'M NOT SCARED OF ANYBODY. LISTEN TO ME. I WILL GIVE YOU EVERYTHING YOU DESIRE BUT YOU MUST LEAVE BEANTOWN NOW! BEANTOWN'S OLD NEWS. WE'VE GOT CONTROL OF EVERY VILLAGE 20 MILES FROM HERE AND IT'S NOT STOPPING THERE. I'M TAKING MY HALF OF THE KINGDOM RIGHT NOW. WANT TO MAKE SOMETHING OF IT? ( laughs ) I DON'T BELIEVE IT. THAT'S ACORN'S WAGON. THAT'S IT, THAT'S HIM. WE'RE GOING HOME. BRING PRINCE. Virginia: OKAY. YOU TALK. AH, HI, ACORN. HI. REMEMBER ME? ANTONY. YOU GOT OUT OF PRISON. HOW, UH... UNLIKELY. WHERE'S OUR MIRROR? MIRROR? IT BELONGS TO US. WAS IT VALUABLE, THEN? NO, IT'S WORTHLESS. YOU'VE COME AN AWFUL LONG WAY TO GET BACK A WORTHLESS MIRROR. IT'S A MAGIC MIRROR. WE TRAVELED HERE THROUGH IT AND WE'VE BEEN TRAPPED HERE EVER SINCE. LOOK, ALL WE WANT TO DO IS GO HOME. WE WON'T TAKE THE MIRROR, OKAY? WE'LL JUST USE IT TO GO HOME AND THEN, YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT WITH IT. I'M MOVED BY WHAT YOU SAY. THEN PLEASE, LET US GO HOME. BUT I DON'T HAVE IT ANYMORE. I'M AFRAID I SWAPPED IT WITH SOMEONE IN THE VILLAGE NOT HALF AN HOUR AGO. SWAPPED IT? SWAPPED IT FOR WHAT? ( baaing ) Queen: WOLF... WOLF. WOLF... WOLF, DO YOU THINK YOU CAN SIMPLY IGNORE ME? I'VE CHANGED. I AM NO LONGER UNDER YOUR INFLUENCE. YOU CANNOT TOUCH ME. OH, REALLY? IT'S A FULL MOON TONIGHT. YOUR BLOOD IS ALREADY HOT. YOU ARE A WOLF. WHAT WILL YOU DO WHEN THE WILD MOON CALLS YOU? WHAT WILL YOU DO THEN TO YOUR NEW FRIENDS? I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD GO INTO THIS VILLAGE. THIS IS WHERE ACORN SAID THE MIRROR WAS. A WOLF GOES BY HIS INSTINCTS AND I DON'T LIKE IT. I MEAN, THIS IS FARMING LAND AND FARMERS DON'T LIKE WOLFIES. HUFF PUFF, NO SIRREE. WHY DON'T WE STOP FOR BREAKFAST AND THINK ABOUT WHAT TO DO? YOU HAD BREAKFAST. THEN I WANT ANOTHER BREAKFAST! WHAT ARE YOU, MY MOTHER? YOU TELL ME WHEN I CAN EAT OR NOT? WHY DON'T YOU JUST DRAW UP A LIST OF THINGS I CAN AND CAN'T DO. WE'RE GOING INTO THE VILLAGE. END OF DISCUSSION. YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU LIKE. VIRGINIA, PLEASE FORGIVE ME. I DIDN'T MEAN TO BE SO RUDE. IT'S JUST THAT MY CYCLE IS COMING ON. ONCE A MONTH, I GET VERY IRRATIONAL AND ANGRY AND I WANT TO PICK A FIGHT WITH ANYONE WHO COMES NEAR ME. SOUNDS FAMILIAR. I'LL BE PERFECTLY, PERFECTLY ALL RIGHT IF YOU JUST KEEP ME AWAY FROM TEMPTATION. YOU KNOW, I GET LIKE THAT, TOO, SOMETIMES. OH. LOOK AT THOSE SHEEP. TROLLOPS. IT SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED. ( gasps ) MORNING. MORNING. MY NAME'S SALLY PEEP. I'M A SHEPHERDESS. THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT. MY, WHAT HAIRY, STRONG ARMS YOU'VE GOT.

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IN AN HOUR'S TIME I'LL ANNOUNCE THE WINNER OF BEST CHEESE IN THE VILLAGE. ( applause ) EXCUSE ME. CAN YOU TELL ME WHO'S IN CHARGE AROUND HERE? I AM THE VILLAGE IDIOT, AND I AM IN CHARGE OF THE WISHING WELL. DO WE HAVE MAGNETS IN OUR POCKETS? HOW DO WE ATTRACT PEOPLE LIKE THIS? IT'S A NICE DOG YOU GOT THERE. HE REMINDS ME OF SOMEONE. Tony: WHAT'S THAT FOR? Idiot: THAT'S THE VILLAGE'S PRESENT FOR PRINCE WENDELL. IT'S TO BE HIS CORONATION CLOAK. I HOPE HE LIKES IT. AREN'T YOU GOING TO MAKE A WISH, THEN? IT'S VERY BAD LUCK TO PASS WITHOUT MAKING A WISH. THAT'S MONEY WE SHOULDN'T BE WASTING. OH, YOU ARE SO PRIM. BUT MY WISH WILL CHANGE ALL OF THAT. ( coins clank ) IT DON'T WORK. IT USED TO BE A REAL MAGIC WISHING WELL. AND FOLKS, THEY TRAVELED FROM ALL OVER THE KINGDOMS TO HAVE THINGS BLESSED IN IT. IT'S ALL DRIED UP NOW. IT HASN'T FLOWED FOR YEARS. I HAVE MADE IT MY LIFE'S WORK... AS FASCINATING AS YOUR STORY IS WE'RE ACTUALLY LOOKING FOR A MIRROR. ABOUT SO BIG, BLACK. WE WERE TOLD THAT SOMEONE BOUGHT IT OFF OF ACORN THE DWARF. MM-HMM. I HAVE MADE IT MY LIFE'S WORK TO WAIT BY THIS WELL UNTIL IT FILLS UP AGAIN. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT? IT'S NO USE, THE MAN IS A COMPLETE IDIOT. IF ONLY. NOW MY FATHER, HE WAS A COMPLETE IDIOT. I'M STILL A HALF-WIT. EVERYWHERE IS FULL, WHAT WITH THE ANNUAL VILLAGE COMPETITION. BUT YOU CAN STAY HERE, IF YOU LIKE. MIGHT NOT BE POSH, LIKE WHAT YOU'RE USED TO. OH. IT STINKS. IT'S GREAT. THANK YOU. BY THE WAY, DO YOU KNOW OF ANYBODY THAT'S BOUGHT A MIRROR FROM A TRAVELING TRADER RECENTLY? OH? AH! YOU'LL WANT TO TALK TO THE LOCAL JUDGE. HE BOUGHT A LOAD OF THINGS OFF THAT DWARF.

I AM CALM AND SERENE. I AM VERY, VERY SERENE. ( gasps ) I AM VERY, VERY SERENELY... HUNGRY. THREE BEAUTIFUL GIRLS AND THREE BEAUTIFUL LAMBS. THIS IS THE HARDEST COMPETITION TO JUDGE SO FAR BY A LONG CHALK. I GIVE MARY EIGHT OUT OF TEN AND A WELL-EARNED THIRD PLACE. ( applause ) BOTH THESE LAMBS ARE SO BEAUTIFUL. HOW DO I MAKE A DECISION? I'VE GOT TO GIVE SALLY PEEP TEN OUT OF TEN. ( screams ) BUT THEN, I ALSO HAVE TO GIVE VIRGINIA LEWIS TEN OUT OF TEN AS WELL. ( cheering ) Man: A TIE? WE CAN'T HAVE A TIE. SOMEONE HAS TO WIN. Sally: I HAVE TO WIN. PEEPS ALWAYS WIN. HOW ABOUT IF YOU GET A TROPHY AND I GET THE MIRROR? THEY'RE BOTH MINE! SHE SHOULDN'T EVEN BE ALLOWED TO TAKE PART. IT'S NOT FAIR. WHY ARE YOU GIVING AN OUTSIDER TEN OUT OF TEN? SHE'S A DIRTY CHEAT. GIVE THE PRIZE TO MY GIRL. BACK OFF! BACK OFF, I SAID! NOW, LOOK... THIS IS A SHEPHERDESS COMPETITION. WE SET UP AN OBSTACLE COURSE. AND WHOEVER GUIDES HER SHEEP INTO THE PEN IN THE SHORTEST TIME IS THE WINNER USING ONLY SHEEP DOGS AND COMMANDS. SOUND FAIR ENOUGH? YEAH, ALL RIGHT. NO. I DON'T HAVE A SHEEP DOG. 'SPECT I'LL WIN THEN, WON'T I? ( laughing ) DAMN, DAMN! WHERE AM I GOING TO FIND A SHEEP DOG? Man: EXCUSE ME. PLEASE, ALL RIGHT? I'M TRYING TO THINK HERE. YOU'VE GOT A DOG. I DON'T HAVE A... THAT DOG? I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE NOTICED BUT THAT DOG... THAT'S IT. YOU'RE AN ABSOLUTE GENIUS. GO, GO. MAGIC WISHING WELL, PLEASE USE YOUR MAGIC... WHATEVER... WATER... TO BRING BACK TO LIFE THIS POOR DOG TRAPPED IN A GOLD BODY. OH, NO. NOT YOU AGAIN. Judge: EACH GIRL STANDS THIS END OF THE VILLAGE AND CAN ONLY USE HER SHEPHERDING SKILLS WITH HER DOG. ARE YOU READY, SALLY? STARTING... NOW! ( whistling ) ( crowd cheering encouragement ) ( bleating ) MOVING UP TO 30. LET IT HAVE WORKED, GOD, PLEASE. LET ONE THING HAVE GONE RIGHT. OH, NO!

YES, YES, YES! WELCOME BACK PRINCEY BOY! ( snarling ) OW! MORON! OW, OW, OW, OW! WHY DID YOU TURN ME INTO GOLD? IT WAS A HEAT OF THE MOMENT KIND OF THING. I WAS TRYING TO PROTECT YOU FROM THOSE TROLLS. OH, YOU REALLY ARE THE MOST INCOMPETENT MANSERVANT I'VE EVER HAD. YOU ARE A COMPLETE IMBECILE. WHAT ARE YOU? ALL RIGHT, I REALLY NEED YOUR HELP HERE, OKAY? TIME STARTS NOW. COME ON, LAMB! COME ON, LAMBEY. COME ON. COME ON. ( bleating ) ( snapping fingers ) ( whistling ) COME HERE, LAMB. COME ON, LAMBEY. COME ON, LAMB! COME ON, LAMB! COME HERE, LAMBEY! COME ON! COME ON! COMING UP TO 30. COME HERE, LAMB, COME ON, COME ON. COME ON, LAMBEY, COME ON! COME ON! AW... ( whistling ) TOUGH LUCK, HARD CHEESE.

NO ONE PERSON COULD DO IT. BYE-BYE. Sally: NO! YOU LIED TO ME, GRAMP. YOU SAID I COULDN'T FAIL TO WIN. WELL, THAT LITTLE WITCH MUST HAVE GOT TO OUR WELL SOMEHOW. IT'S THE ONLY EXPLANATION. YOU'VE MADE ME LOOK A FOOL IN FRONT OF THE WHOLE VILLAGE! I CAN MAKE YOU SUFFER FOR THIS, WILF! ( sobbing ) ( growling ) ( snarling ) Tony: COME ON, COME ON, COME ON. HOW COME IT'S NOT SHOWING OUR WORLD? I DON'T KNOW. I WAS TALKING TO PRINCE. Prince: BECAUSE IT'S NOT TURNED ON. THERE'S PROBABLY A SECRET CATCH SOMEWHERE. HE SAID IT'S PROBABLY NOT TURNED ON. WELL, HOW DID YOU GET THROUGH IT IN THE FIRST PLACE? I FELL ON IT. IT CAN'T BE THAT HARD TO FIND. I DON'T... WHAT'S THIS? IT'S CENTRAL PARK. THAT'S WOLMAN RINK. Sally: WOLF! WOLF! ( screaming ) SALLY PEEP'S BEEN MURDERED! CAUGHT HIM RED-HANDED! Wolf: I WAS TRYING TO GET THOSE SHEEP TO THE SIDE. I DIDN'T DO NOTHING! SALLY PEEP'S BEEN MURDERED! ( groaning ) MAKE WAY FOR THE MURDERER! BURN HIM! VIRGINIA! VIRGINIA! VIRGINIA... I DIDN'T DO NOTHING! VIRGINIA! VIRGINIA... ( grunts ) Soldier: HALT! ( groaning ) ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? YOUR MAJESTY...? MIRROR... MIRROR. FIND ME A MIRROR. FIND A MIRROR! THE MAN IS AN IDIOT. HE'S CAUSING ME SO MUCH TROUBLE. YOU'RE DEAD! YOU HEAR ME! NEXT TIME I SEE YOU, YOU'RE DEAD! CEASE FIGHTING IMMEDIATELY OR YOU WILL BE OVERRUN AND WE WILL LOSE THIS KINGDOM! DO YOU UNDERSTAND?! I'M TAKING THE KINGDOM! THEN I'M COMING FOR YOU, YOU EVIL PIG! BEHOLD THE TROLL KING'S LATEST ADVANCE. HE'S RAVAGING THE KINGDOM. IT LOOKS LIKE SOME AWFUL DISEASE. SURELY THE TROLLS ARE NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO... TO SEIZE THE ENTIRE KINGDOM. WELL, WHO WILL STOP THEM? IF NO ONE ELSE WILL SAY IT, THEN I WILL. WHERE IS WENDELL IN OUR HOUR OF NEED? WHERE IS HE? HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE PERFORMING PREARRANGED ACTS OF BRAVERY BEFORE HIS CORONATION AND NOW THERE'S A REAL CRISIS, HE'S JUST RUN AWAY. HE'S... HE'S NOT FIT TO BE KING. WRITE THAT DOWN. PUT IT DOWN. PUT IT DOWN! SIRS, FORGIVE ME. I HAVE THE MOST DREADFUL NEWS. WHAT IS IT? VISCOUNT LANSKY'S HORSE HAS RETURNED FROM THE GREAT FOREST RIDERLESS. GENTLEMEN, WE HAVE RUN OUT OF OPTIONS. WE MUST ACCEPT MILITARY ASSISTANCE FROM THE FIRST AND NINTH KINGDOMS TO PROTECT OUR PEOPLE. THE PRICE OF THEIR AID, HOWEVER, IS INDEED HIGH. THE FOURTH KINGDOM WILL BE DIVIDED INTO QUARTERS AND RUN BY THE COUNCIL OF THE NINE KINGDOMS IN PERPETUITY, AND WENDELL WILL FOREGO ANY CHANCE OF EVER TAKING THE THRONE. NO! NO! I WILL NOT ACCEPT IT! I'VE BEEN PLANNING THIS CORONATION FOR 3? YEARS! FORGET THE CORONATION, LORD RUPERT! WE MUST SIGN AWAY SOVEREIGNTY OR LOSE EVERYTHING. All: BURN HIM! BURN THE WOLF! BURN HIM! BURN THE WOLF! VIRGINIA, THERE'S BEEN A TERRIBLE MISTAKE. LOOK, WOLF WE'RE GOING HOME. HUFF PUFF, YOU CAN'T! LOOK, WE DON'T BELONG HERE. NO! AND WHATEVER MESS YOU'VE GOTTEN YOURSELF INTO IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH US! ( whining ) PLEASE, DON'T CRY. LOOK, NOTHING YOU CAN SAY IS EVER GOING TO CHANGE MY MIND. ( whining weakly ) THAT'S HOME, FRITZ. WELL, IT'S NOT HOME FOR ME, TONY. AND YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY THINK OF GOING HOME WHILE YOU REMAIN MY MANSERVANT. ALL RIGHT. LET'S GET SOMETHING STRAIGHT YOUR ROYAL DOGNESS. I AM NOT YOUR MANSERVANT. AHA. SO, DID YOU BREAK THE NEWS TO HIM? YES. WELL, SORT OF. ( cow moos ) WHAT'S "SORT OF"? SORT OF AGREED TO REPRESENT HIM. VIRGINIA! I DON'T THINK HE KILLED ANYBODY. THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO THINK. THERE'S A DEAD GIRL OUT THERE! IT COULD HAVE BEEN YOU. HE'S A WOLF. THAT'S WHAT WOLVES DO. THAT'S THE FIRST INTELLIGENT THING YOU'VE SAID, ANTHONY. Virginia: LOOK, WE HAVE THE MIRROR. WE CAN GO HOME ANY TIME. SO, LET'S GO RIGHT NOW. LET'S GO RIGHT THIS MINUTE BEFORE WE'RE TURNED INTO GIANT PIGS OR TRAMPLED BY GOBLINS OR WHATEVER'S NEXT IN THIS MADHOUSE. I AM NOT GOING ANYWHERE UNTIL I TRY TO HELP HIM. HOW...? HELP ME HIDE THIS THING UNDER THE STRAW IN THE WAGON. YOU NEVER USED TO BE THIS OBSTINATE, YOU KNOW? THAT'S SOMETHING HE'S TAUGHT YOU. SOMEBODY HAD TO, DIDN'T THEY? WHAT ARE YOU WEARING? I HAD NO CHOICE. YOU HAVE TO. YOU KNOW, VIRGINIA, YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE LAWS AROUND HERE. AS A MATTER OF FACT, YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT LAW AT ALL. MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE REPRESENTED HIM. EXCUSE ME. WHO GOT YOU OUT OF THE PARKING TICKETS? WHO TOOK THE POLAROID OF THE BROKEN METER? VIRGINIA, THIS IS A MURDER CASE. JUSTICE IS UNIVERSAL. IT'S NO GOOD. IT'S NO GOOD. WE'VE LOST ALREADY, MY CREAMY COUNSEL. THE LOCAL JURY IS CERTAIN TO BE BIASED AGAINST ME. NOW, THAT IS WHAT I DON'T WANT TO HEAR... NEGATIVE THINKING. ANY JURY CAN BE SWAYED. ALL YOU NEED IS A... ( all bleating ) OH, MY GOD. ( crowd clamoring ) Bailiff: ALL RISE FOR THE HONORABLE JUDGE. IT GIVES ME NO PLEASURE TO SENTENCE THIS WOLF TO DEATH ( bleating ) FOR THE TERRIBLE CRIME... OBJECTION, YOUR HONOR! WE HAVEN'T HEARD ANY EVIDENCE YET. OH. ALL RIGHT. WELL, UM, MOVE IT ALONG NICE AND BRISK, EH? LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY, EWES AND RAMS BEFORE YOU LEAVE THIS COURTROOM TODAY I WILL NOT ONLY HAVE PROVED MY CLIENT'S INNOCENCE BEYOND ANY REASONABLE DOUBT-- OW. BUT ALSO UNMASKED THE REAL KILLER. Judge: JUST A POT OF LEMON TEA AND A SLICE OF ROSIE PEEP'S GINGER CAKE. THANK YOU. LOOK AT THIS POOR MAN BEFORE YOU. IS HE A WOLF? NO. BUT HE IS A STRANGER AND STRANGER EQUALS WOLF. AND WOLF EQUALS KILLER. IS THAT WHAT WE'RE SAYING? Judge: VERY WELL PUT! NOW TO THE SENTENCING. YOUR HONOR I'M ONLY JUST BEGINNING. I WOULD LIKE TO CALL MY FIRST WITNESS. WILFRED PEEP, YOU SAW MY CLIENT RUNNING AWAY FROM THE SCENE OF THE CRIME IS THAT RIGHT? CLEAR AS DAYLIGHT. IT WAS HIM. OOH, THAT WAS ME. THAT'S HIM! BURN HIM. BURN HIM. I'M WONDERING IF YOU CAN READ THIS. OF COURSE, I CAN. IT SAYS, "NO TRESPASSING ACCORDING TO..." THANK YOU. I WONDER, MR. PEEP, IF YOU CAN READ IT NOW AT THE SAME DISTANCE YOU SAY YOU CLEARLY SAW MY CLIENT RUNNING AWAY FROM THE MURDER SCENE. "...ACCORDING TO LITTLE LAMB VILLAGE COUNSEL RULING NUMBER 714B. AND BYLAW 21-A." NO FURTHER QUESTIONS, THANK YOU. ( crowd laughing derisively ) YOU CRIPES! WE GOT TO DO SOMETHING TO HELP HIM. HE'S A WOLF. WHAT DO YOU EXPECT? HE'S ONLY DONE EXACTLY WHAT I SAID HE'D DO ALL ALONG. VIRGINIA BELIEVES IN HIM AND I BELIEVE IN VIRGINIA. NOTHING YOU CAN SAY WILL MAKE ME HELP HIM. YOU WANT TO EAT TONIGHT? MISS PEEP, WHAT IS YOUR PROFESSION? I'M A SHEPHERDESS. OH, A SHEPHERDESS... OR TEMPTRESS? OH, YEAH, TEMPTRESS. SHE'S A TEMPTRESS. I'M A GOOD GIRL. THAT WOLF CAME UP TO US GIRLS AND HE KEPT TRYING TO TOUCH US AND SHOW US HIS TAIL. OH, THAT'S A LIE! THEY PROVOKED ME! PROVOKED YOU TO WHAT?! P-P-PROVOKED ME TO NOTHING. BUT THEY SURE WERE TRYING. MISS PEEP! MISS PEEP, I SUGGEST THAT YOU AND SALLY PEEP WERE THE EASIEST SHEPHERDESSES IN TOWN. ( crowd clamoring ) ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT AN INNOCENT YOUNG GIRL FROM THIS VILLAGE MIGHT KISS A MAN BEFORE SHE'S MARRIED? WELL, A BIT MORE THAN THAT, YOUR HONOR. OH, YOU TRY MY PATIENCE. YOU ARE JUST THIS FAR FROM BEING THROWN ON THE BONFIRE WITH THAT FILTHY MURDERING WOLF! WHAT CAN YOU SMELL? ( sniffing ): YOUR BODY ODOR. YOU HAVEN'T EVEN TRIED. GO ON. SEE WHAT YOU CAN SMELL. WHY DON'T YOU GET DOWN ON ALL FOURS AND SEE WHAT YOU CAN SMELL? IT'S MAINLY FEET AND EXCREMENT AT GROUND LEVEL. HAS THAT OCCURRED TO YOU? CAN YOU PICK UP A SCENT? THERE'S HUNDREDS OF SCENTS. WELL, YES BUT ONLY A GREAT HUNTING PRINCE LIKE YOURSELF COULD DISTINGUISH THAT SPECIAL SCENT WE'RE LOOKING FOR. CORRECT. YOU GOT IT? LET'S GO. Judge: HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE SALLY PEEP? OBJECTION. SALLY... VERY CUTE. SUCCULENT. NICE GIRL. A VERY TASTY LITTLE BIRDY AND NO MISTAKE. NICE ENOUGH TO EAT? OH, YES! WHAT? NO. NO, I DIDN'T MEAN THAT. SHE WAS ASKING FOR IT, IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING? SHE WAS BEGGING FOR IT. I MEAN SHE WAS GAGGING FOR IT. NO, NO. I JUST MEANT THAT SOME OF THESE GIRLS ARE VERY PROVOCATIVE. THEY KNOW THAT A WOLF... WELL IT'S, IT'S LIKE THRUSTING A STEAK IN FRONT OF A STARVING MAN. IS IT, INDEED? OH, NO, I DIDN'T MEAN THAT, EITHER. SEE? I'M TWISTING EVERYTHING I'M SAYING! HE'S SUFFERING FROM POST-MENSTRUAL TENSION, YOUR HONOR. WHO'S MENSTRUSENT? PEN... WHATEVER IT IS? THE NIGHT BEFORE THE MURDER, THERE WAS A HENHOUSE HOMICIDE RESULTING IN THE DEATH OF TEN CHICKENS. ANYTHING TO DO WITH YOU? NO, SIR. YOU DIDN'T KILL THOSE CHICKENS? NO, SIR! YOU DIDN'T GO NEAR THE HENHOUSE? ABSOLUTELY NOT, SIR. THEN HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THIS? THAT IS A PIECE OF YOUR SHIRT RECOVERED FROM INSIDE THE PEEP'S CHICKEN COOP. ( recalling ): OH, THE CHICKENS! LET ME THINK. YES, YES. I MIGHT HAVE EATEN ALL THE CHICKENS. AND THEN YOU KILLED SALLY PEEP. OH, A COUPLE OF DRUMSTICKS DOESN'T MAKE ME A KILLER. I HAD CHICKEN FOR DINNER, I ADMIT IT BUT I DIDN'T TOUCH NO GIRL, I SWEAR! THEN WHY DID YOU LIE? YES, WHY DID YOU LIE? BECAUSE IF I SAID YES TO THE CHICKENS THEN YOU'RE GOING TO THINK I WOLFED DOWN THE GIRL AS WELL! THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT WE THINK. BUT I DIDN'T DO IT! I DIDN'T DO IT, VIRGINIA! OF COURSE, HE DIDN'T. I DIDN'T DO IT! Virginia: OF COURSE, HE DIDN'T DO IT! OF COURSE, HE DIDN'T DO IT. BUT IF HE DIDN'T KILL SALLY PEEP THEN WHO DID? Man: WHO DID? I HEAR MYSELF ASKING MYSELF... BECAUSE THE TIME HAS COME FOR ME TO POINT THE FINGER AT THE REAL KILLER... BECAUSE... BECAUSE LAST NIGHT THERE WAS ANOTHER MAN WALKING AROUND DRESSED AS A WOLF. YES! THE MAN IN THE WOLF MASK IS THE REAL KILLER. AND THAT MURDERING PIECE OF FILTH IS THE ONE THAT SHOULD BE ON THIS WITNESS STAND NOW. THE HONOR OF PLAYING THE WOLF IN THE ANNUAL FAIR HAS ALWAYS GONE TO AN UNIMPEACHABLE MEMBER OR OUR SOCIETY. I DON'T CARE. BRING THE SLEAZEBAG IN. LET ME CROSS-EXAMINE HIM AND I GUARANTEE WE'LL HAVE OUR MURDERER. AND WHEN THAT HONOR WAS BESTOWED ON ME LAST WEEK, I WAS ONLY TOO HAPPY TO ACCEPT. I'M MOST DREADFULLY SORRY, YOUR HONOR. THE PEEP'S BARN. ( sniffing ) COME HERE. COME HERE. I'VE BEEN HERE, ALL RIGHT? I KNOW ABOUT THE WELL. THIS IS WHERE SHE CAME FROM. SHE WAS HERE JUST BEFORE SHE WAS MURDERED. I CAN SMELL HER HERE. MEMBERS OF THE JURY, YOU HAVE HEARD THE EVIDENCE MOST OF IT QUITE RIDICULOUS. SOME OF IT. NOW, THOSE WHO BELIEVE HIM INNOCENT ALL GO INTO THE LEFT-HAND PEN. THOSE WHO KNOW HIM TO BE GUILTY GO INTO THE RIGHT-HAND PEN. THE RIGHT-HAND PEN IS FULL OF FOOD. Wolf: YEAH, IT'S FULL OF FOOD! ( Wolf howling ) THE GYPSY WAS RIGHT! A GIRL DEAD, A WOLF BURNS. SO WHAT IF THIS IS WHERE SALLY CAME FROM? I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU EXPECT TO FIND. THE WELL. SOMEBODY'S DESTROYED THE MAGIC WELL. WHO COULD... SHH! I'M GETTING A NEW SCENT. I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING IMPORTANT HERE. BY A UNANIMOUS VERDICT, I PRONOUNCE YOU GUILTY OF MURDER MOST HEINOUS. NO, NO! I SENTENCE YOU TO BE BURNED AT THE STAKE. LET'S DO IT RIGHT AWAY BEFORE THE MARVELOUS MARROW CONTEST. ( howls ) IT'S NOT FAIR! ( crowd yelling ) WOLF! ( crowd continues yelling ) I DIDN'T DO IT! I DIDN'T DO IT! ( Wolf howls ) YOU CANNOT DO THIS. YOU HAVEN'T GIVEN HIM A FAIR TRAIL. VIRGINIA, I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER ME ALL NICE PLEASE FOREVER. SEEMS ONLY RIGHT THAT FAMILY SHOULD DO IT, WILF. I'LL BURN HIM. STOP! STOP! STOP! STOP! WOLF DID NOT KILL SALLY PEEP AND I CAN PROVE IT! HE'LL SAY ANYTHING. DON'T! LISTEN TO ME. THE PEEP FAMILY HAS CHEATED YOU FOR YEARS. THEY HAVE THEIR OWN MAGIC WELL. THEY'VE STOPPED THE REST OF YOU FROM GETTING ANY OF THE WATER. WHEN SALLY PEEP LOST THE COMPETITION SHE WRECKED YOUR WELL, DIDN'T SHE, WILFRED? YOU FOUND OUT WHAT SHE DID. YOU FOLLOWED HER UP INTO THE FIELD AND YOU KILLED HER, DIDN'T YOU? I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. WE DON'T HAVE NO MAGIC WELL. WHY DO THINK THEY'VE WON THE COMPETITIONS YEAR AFTER YEAR? WHY DO THINK THEIR FOOD TASTES BETTER? I BELIEVE HIM! YOU PEEPS HAVE CHEATED US FOR TOO LONG. OH, WHERE'S THE PROOF TO ANY OF THIS? PROVE THAT I KILLED SALLY. THAT'S RIGHT. PROVE IT. WHERE'S YOUR COAT, WILFRED? THE ONE YOU WERE WEARING LAST NIGHT? ( whistles ) THE DOG. HE'S GOT WILF'S COAT. BLOOD. ( astonished exclamations ) BLOOD! IT'S BLOOD. ( all gasp ) POOR SALLY, SHE WASN'T YELLING "WOLF" AT ALL WAS SHE, WILFRED? SHE WAS SCREAMING YOUR NAME. WILF...! WILF...! SHE'D RUINED THE WELL. DIRTY LITTLE VIXEN. SHE'D DESTROYED ALL THE MAGIC. YOU KILLED OUR SALLY?! I OUGHT TO KILL YOU! ( crowd shouting and screaming ) Wolf: MY THREE FRIENDS! HOW COULD I EVER THANK YOU ENOUGH? YOU SAVED MY BACON. OH, THANKS, OLD CHAP. OH, I OWE YOU A VERY BIG BONE. I'M ACTUALLY DISGUSTED THAT YOU'RE STILL WITH US. YOU REPULSE ME. WHY DID I HAVE TO SAVE YOUR LIFE? OH, YES, FROM NOW ON, WE ARE FRIENDS FOR LIFE. AND AS FOR YOU-- VIRGINIA, WHAT A COURTROOM DRAMA. SO, UM, YOU CURED NOW? OH, COMPLETELY. BACK TO MY OLD SELF. YEAH? I CAN'T REMEMBER MUCH ABOUT IT BUT I DO REMEMBER THAT YOU AND TONY-BOY LAID DOWN YOUR LIVES FOR ME. IT WAS THE MOST AMAZING THING; SO DRAMATIC. WH...? WHAT HAPPENED TO THE WAGON? AND OUR MIRROR? OH, MY SON JOHN HE'S JUST TAKEN HIS PIGS TO MARKET. LEFT A COUPLE OF HOURS AGO. OH, WHICH WAY AND HOW FAR? WELL, IT'S NOT A JOURNEY YOU'D WANT TO MAKE ON FOOT. BYE-BYE. BYE-BYE. DID YOU ENJOY YOUR STAY AT OUR VILLAGE? NOT EXACTLY. WISH I COULD REMEMBER WHO THAT DOG REMINDS ME OF. LET ME MAKE A SUGGESTION: PRINCE WENDELL, YOUR RULER. PRINCE WENDELL? DON'T BE SO DAFT. ( whines ) NO, IT WAS A PUPPY I ONCE KNEW CALLED MR. FLEAS. AH, SPLENDID... MR. FLEAS. ANTONY, CAN WE LEAVE THIS VILLAGE? ONE IDIOT IN OUR GROUP IS QUITE ENOUGH. LET'S GO. AREN'T YOU GOING TO MAKE A WISH THEN? WHY DON'T YOU MAKE IT FOR US? YEAH. BYE. ( loud splash ) THAT SOUNDS LIKE OUR WELL'S GETTING SOME WATER BACK IN IT. OH, JOY! OH, YAY! OH, YAY! THE WATER IS BACK ON! ( crowd cheering ) FINALLY, I AM A COMPLETE IDIOT! Virginia: "ASK YOURSELF THESE QUESTIONS: "DO YOU FREQUENTLY CONCEAL YOUR EMOTIONS? "DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU DO EVERYTHING FOR OTHER PEOPLE AND THEN RESENT IT?" "EVERY DAY IN EVERY WAY I AM BECOMING A NEW AND BETTER MAN." I'M ON THE FINAL PAGE OF THE FINAL CHAPTER OF MY FINAL BOOK. I NOW TOTALLY UNDERSTAND WOMEN TOP TO BOTTOM. I HAVE PERFECTED A TECHNIQUE OF NOT LOOKING AT HER ALL THE TIME. VERY DIFFICULT. I THINK I'VE SUCCEEDED. "I AM LISTENING TO MY EMOTIONS AND I AM AT ONE WITH MYSELF." HANG ON, I HAVEN'T FINISHED THAT PAGE YET. TURN BACK. I'VE MANAGED TO STOP MY TONGUE FROM LOLLING WHEN SHE AROUSES ME. I'VE TRANSFORMED MYSELF INTO A NEW MAN SOON, SHE WILL BE MINE. ( soft harp music playing ) Tony: WHERE EXACTLY ARE WE? WE HAVE ENTERED THE MOST ROMANTIC TOWN IN THE WHOLE OF THE NINE KINGDOMS. THE KISSING TOWN WHERE EVERYONE FALLS IN LOVE. TRULY, FATE HAS LED US HERE. DREAM ON. YOU'LL SEE. Tony: YEAH, WELL, WE DIDN'T COME HERE FOR THAT. WE CAME FOR THE MIRROR, ALL RIGHT? HELLO, I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU ALL DAY. I CAN SEE LOVE AND FORTUNE COMING YOUR WAY. WELL... WELL, IT'S SLICE THE FRUITCAKE TIME AGAIN. DAD. GREAT ROMANCE, GREAT WEALTH BEFORE THIS VERY NIGHT IS OUT. AH, AND WHICH ONE OF US MAKES THE MONEY? YOUR AURA IS CLOUDY. JUST GIVE ME A COUPLE OF COINS. IT'S THE OLD CLOUDY AURA BIT. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? YOU ARE SUCH A SOFT TOUCH. YES; SOFT, SENSUOUS... CREAMY TOUCH. NOW, IF YOU LOOK OVER THERE YOU MIGHT FIND WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR. GOOD-BYE. WAIT... GO GET... THAT'S THE PIG WAGON. THE ONE THE MIRROR WAS IN. IT WAS, WASN'T IT? HOW DID SHE KNOW THAT? YEAH, COME ON. COME ON. IS THIS YOURS? WHERE'S OUR MIRROR? I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS YOURS, NOW DID I? WHERE IS IT? YOU WOULDN'T WANT IT NOW, ANYWAY. IT'S COVERED IN PIG SWILL. WHERE IS IT?! I DON'T RIGHTLY KNOW. WHAT? FELLA GAVE ME FIVE COPPERS FOR IT THIS MORNING. FIVE COPPERS? WHAT FELLA? PASSING THROUGH WITH A WHEELBARROW FULL OF BRICKY BRAC. PROBABLY COME FOR THE ANTIQUES MARKET. BRICKY...? YOU'LL NEVER FIND IT NOW, ANTONY. WE'RE NOT... THIS PLACE IS FULL OF OLD THINGS. YOU'D DO BEST TO SPLIT UP. YEAH. SHAME YOU WON'T HAVE ANY TIME FOR ROMANCE, THOUGH. BRICKY BRAC. BRICKY BRAC. YOU KNOW SOMETHING? YOUR TROUBLE IS THAT YOU'VE NOT HAD TO DO A HARD DAYS WORK YOUR ENTIRE LIFE. WHAT WOULD YOU KNOW ABOUT THE SUFFERING OF ROYALTY? YOU SEEM TO HAVE BEEN SOME KIND OF CLEANER IN YOUR WORLD. YEAH, WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT? ALL RIGHT? NOTHING SHAMEFUL ABOUT CLEANING. AND I HAD MONEY ONCE, YOU KNOW THAT? I WAS RICH. YOU? RICH? YES. YES. I HAD A THRIVING PLASTICS BUSINESS. I WAS MAKING 55 GRAND A YEAR WHEN I WAS 21 YEARS OLD. OH, SO LET ME GUESS... YOU LOST IT ALL. NO, I JUST... KIND OF OVER-STRETCHED MYSELF. I PUT ALL MY MONEY INTO AN IDEA THAT JUST DIDN'T PAN OUT. AND WHAT WAS THAT? BOUNCY CASTLES. WE HAD THE ROBIN AND MAID MARIAN. JOLLY JESTER, THE HAUNTED CASTLE. YOU KNOW, WE HAD THE COWBOY AND INDIAN BOUNCER. ONE OF OUR MOST POPULAR ITEMS. AND THE ZIGZAG BOUNCE. OUR MOTTO WAS: "PUT THE BOUNCE BACK IN YOUR LIFE." OH, PLEASE, STOP, ANTONY. OH, NO. IT CAN'T BE. THE TROLLS. NOT A VERY ATTRACTIVE WORK I'LL GRANT YOU BUT FULL OF VITALITY AND LIFE. FROZEN RAGE. DOES IT TICKLE YOUR FANCY? NOT EVEN A LITTLE BIT. ACTUALLY, THOUGH I AM LOOKING FOR A MIRROR. IT'S ABOUT MY HEIGHT, BLACK... I SEEM TO REMEMBER A JOB LOT OF JUNK. IT'S IN THERE. WOLF, DO YOU REALLY THINK WE'RE GOING TO FIND THE MIRROR HERE? I THINK WE SHOULD GET BACK TO TOWN. REMEMBER THE STORY OF SNOW WHITE WHEN SHE SWALLOWED THE POISON APPLE AND EVERYONE THOUGHT SHE WAS DEAD? THE SEVEN DWARFS, THEY BROUGHT HER HERE AND PUT HER IN A GLASS COFFIN... HERE? IN HOPES SOMEONE MIGHT BRING HER BACK TO LIFE. IN THIS TOWN? TO THE TOP OF THIS VERY HILL. PRINCE'S GRANDMOTHER. Virginia: OH, MY GOD. LOOK. IS THIS THE REAL GLASS COFFIN? I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS. I JUST-- I JUST FEEL SO GOOD. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS. YOU REALLY DO. EVERYONE DOES IN THE KISSING TOWN. EXCUSE ME. EXCUSE ME. THAT'S IT. THAT'S IT! THAT'S IT! PSST... DON'T ATTRACT ATTENTION. LOOK AT THAT. "10 TO 15 GOLD COINS." IT'S PRICED REALLY LOW. NOBODY KNOWS WHAT IT IS. DON'T TURN IT ON IN HERE, YOU MORON. EVERYONE WILL SEE. HMM... WHAT DO YOU THINK? OH, WHAT? THIS? OH... I WOULDN'T EVEN WASTE MY TIME. JUST A PIECE OF JUNK. AT FIRST, I THOUGHT IT WAS A REPRODUCTION. LATE NAKED EMPEROR AT BEST. BUT, I THINK IT'S OLDER THAN THAT. QUITE A LOT OLDER. MAYBE EVEN EARLY CINDERELLAN. AND QUITE A LOT MORE SPECIAL. RIGHT, SO, MISSY WHITE IS LYING HERE FOR YEARS AND EVERYONE THINKS SHE'S DEAD. CLOSE YOUR EYES. SLOW DOWN YOUR BREATHING SO YOUR CHEST IS ALMOST NOT MOVING AT ALL. THAT'S NICE. AND ALL THESE-- THESE HANDSOME CHAPS COME ALONG AND TRY TO BRING HER AROUND BUT NONE OF THEM WERE GOOD ENOUGH FOR HER. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? HMM. AND THEN ONE DAY THIS DROP-DEAD GORGEOUS PRINCE COMES PAST AND HE STOPS, THINKS... OH, WHAT A QUIRKY GIRL. WHAT A SWEETIE PIE. BUT SHE'S FROZEN... COLD. SHE RESISTS HIS EVERY CALL WITH HER FROZEN COUNTENANCE AND HE REALIZES THAT THE ONLY WAY HE CAN MELT THIS ICE QUEEN IS TO MASSAGE THE LIFE BACK INTO HER SOFT, CREAMY LIPS WITH A KISS. Tony: HEY! HEY! WOULD YOU TWO STOP CLOWNING AROUND! I FOUND THE MIRROR. COME ON. IT WAS RIGHT HERE; IT'S GONE. HEY, WAIT! HEY... THE MIRROR THAT WAS HERE WHERE IS IT? OH, YOU MEAN THE MAGIC MIRROR? WHAT A FIND. WE'RE ALL TREMENDOUSLY EXCITED ABOUT IT. IT'S IN THERE. NOW IT'S 5,000? WE'LL NEVER RAISE THAT. Wendell: OH, ANTHONY, THIS IS THE MOST TERRIBLE MESS. LOOK AT THAT-- "WENDELL'S DISGRACE." THEY'RE CANCELING MY CORONATION AND ALL YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT IS FINDING 5,000 WENDELLS TO GET YOUR STUPID MIRROR BACK. HOW MANY WE GOT ALTOGETHER? EXACTLY 30 GOLD WENDELLS. ( sighs ) HOW ARE WE GOING TO CHANGE 30 COINS INTO 5,000 BY TOMORROW MORNING? GIVE THEM TO ME. COME ON, COME ON, COME ON. COME ON, I GOT AN IDEA. COME ON. I HOPE THIS IS GOING TO GET MY CORONATION BACK ON AGAIN. Tony: TRUST ME. TRUST ME. THIS IS ONE OF MY BEST IDEAS. HERE, HERE, HERE. HERE'S THE PLACE. MAY I REMIND YOU THAT ALL YOUR IDEAS HAVE SO FAR RESULTED IN TOTAL FAILURE. LOOK, HERE WE'VE GOT TEN COINS APIECE, ALL RIGHT? NOW, ONE OF US HAS TO WIN A FORTUNE BY DAYBREAK. THERE, THERE, THERE. THANK YOU. AND I MADE SOMETHING FOR PRINCE. OH, NO, NO. TELL HER I REFUSE. HE SAYS HE LOVES IT. IT'S SO HUMILIATING. Virginia: EVERY LITTLE BIT HELPS. WE FOUND HIM LIKE THIS FIVE MINUTES AGO. NOW HE WON'T COME DOWN. KEEP AWAY FROM ME, OR I'LL JUMP! I'LL JUST JUMP AND THEN YOU'LL BE SORRY. HA, HA, HA, THAT'LL SPOIL YOUR PLANS. IS THERE SOMETHING YOU WANTED TO GET OFF YOUR CHEST? I REFUSE TO BE A MAN. I WON'T DO IT ANY LONGER. I INSIST ON BEING A DOG. ( panting ) WELL, ANY PARTICULAR REASON? WELL, HOW CAN I STROKE MYSELF? AH. HOW CAN I MISS MYSELF LIKE I MISS MY MASTER? I DEMAND TO BE A HAPPY PUPPY! WOOF! WOOF! WOOF! ( panting ) WELL, YOU'VE CERTAINLY MADE YOUR POINT. NOW, PLEASE ALLOW ME TO MAKE MINE. ( coughing ) THERE ARE NO MASTERS HERE! AND ONLY ONE MISTRESS. DON'T FORGET THAT, DOGGY. I BOOKED YOU A RIDING LESSON. OH, DEAR. ( crying ) PLACE YOUR BETS, PLEASE. EXCUSE ME, MISS. WHAT'S THE HIGHEST RETURN POSSIBLE ON ONE GOLD WENDELL BET? WELL, SIR, YOU'D WANT TO BET ON THE GRAND JACKRABBIT JACKPOT. 10,000-TO-ONE ODDS. OH, YEAH... BUT IT'S ONLY EVER BEEN WON ONCE. THAT'S THE GAME FOR ME. I'LL RAISE YOU... 20. I SNEER AT YOUR 20. RAISE YOU 50. PLACE YOUR BETS. PLACE YOUR BETS. WOLF WILL WIN THE JACKPOT AND THEN VIRGINIA WILL LOVE HIM EVEN MORE. BUT IF WOLF WINS, THEN VIRGINIA GETS THE MIRROR... AND THEN VIRGINIA GOES HOME. OH, CRIPES! 160. BAD LUCK, SIR. ( relieved sigh ) THANK YOU. TICKIE-POO. ANOTHER. CALL IT. HAVE YOU GOT... MR. BUN THE BAKER MAN? ( chuckling ) READ 'EM AND WEEP. OH, POOR BABY. LOOK AT MY HAPPY FAMILIES! ( sniffing ) DOGS DON'T LIKE HORSES. BUT PRINCES DO. UP YOU GET. COME ON, UP YOU GET. HERE WE GO. ( whimpers ) THAT'S IT, NICELY. TAKE IT EASY NOW. UP YOU GET! ( horse neighing ) OFF YOU GO. THERE WE ARE. THERE WE ARE. ( whimpering ) THE HORSE ISN'T GOING TO MOVE UNLESS YOU GIVE HIM A COMMAND. HIT HIM. ( taps ) ( shrieks ) ( exasperated sigh ) HA! ( horse whinnying ) HELP ME! SOMEBODY HELP ME, PLEASE! AAH! STOP, HORSEY! SLOW DOWN! YOUR MAJESTY... THE PRINCE HAS ESCAPED. ( footsteps running off ) ( sighs ) IT'S GONE WRONG. IT'S ALL GONE WRONG. ALL MY GREAT PLAN. COME TO ME. COME TO ME... AND YOUR MIND WILL CLEAR. YOUR MAJESTY. I CRAVE YOUR GUIDANCE. THE TROLL KING IS OUT OF CONTROL THE DOG IS STILL MISSING AND THE PRINCE HAS ESCAPED. PLEASE, I NEED YOUR HELP. KILL THE TROLL KING. BUT HOW? HE IS SO STRONG. HE HAS AN ARMY TO PROTECT HIM. HOW DID I KILL SNOW WHITE? THE OLD WAYS ARE THE BEST. ( cackling ) ( galloping horse approaching ) ( horse neighing ) WHOA! ( grunts ) MOM! MOM! MOM, MOM! WHAT IS IT? COME SEE, MOM. SEE WHAT? THERE'S A MAN WITH OUR ROVER. THERE'S A MAN? Girl: LOOK.

( screaming ) OH! "DWARF MINES." THIS MUST BE WHERE THEY MAKE THE MIRRORS. WHOA. CAN'T EVEN SEE THE BOTTOM. I CAN'T GO DOWN THERE, NOT WITH MY LUCK. I THINK IT'S THE ONLY WAY. OH, NO, NO, I DON'T THINK SO. COME ON, JUST GET ON BEHIND ME. LOOK, IF DWARVES CAN DO IT, IT MUST BE SAFE. COME ON, PRINCE. HOW DOES THAT FOLLOW? YOU KNOW WHAT? IT COULD HAVE A VERY LOW CEILING. YOU KNOW, VIRGINIA, IT MIGHT NOT EVEN BE A SLIDE AT ALL. IT COULD BE A DRAGON FEEDING TROUGH... ( both screaming ) OH, DEAR. COME ON, DAD, YOU CAN DO IT. SEE? YOU MADE IT. GOOD JOB. GREAT. Dwarf Leader: ATTENTION! ATTENTION! COMRADES, THIS IS A GREAT DAY! THE TIME HAS COME TO... BEHOLD THE BIRTH OF THE MIRROR! NO ONE HAS MADE A TRUTH MIRROR FOR OVER 500 YEARS! BEHOLD PRINCE WENDELL'S CORONATION GIFT! ( cheering ) ( whispering ): SEE THAT, PRINCE? THAT'S FOR YOU. OW! OW! OW! OW! OW! DO YOU REALIZE THE PENALTY FOR ENTERING OUR SECRET MIRROR MINES, COMRADES? IS IT A HEAVY FINE? IT IS DEATH. THIS IS OUR MOUNTAIN. YOU KNOW WHAT? AND YOU CAN HAVE IT. WE'RE JUST TRYING TO GET BACK TO THE FOURTH KINGDOM. YEAH, WE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WE WERE TRESPASSING. IGNORANCE IS NO EXCUSE. YOU HAVE ILLEGALLY ENTERED THE UNDERGROUND NINTH KINGDOM AND ANYONE WHO TRIES TO STEAL OUR SECRETS WILL DIE. SECRETS? NO, NO, NO, YOU CAN KEEP YOUR SECRETS. WE ACTUALLY NEED YOUR HELP. RIGHT, RIGHT. YOU SEE, THERE WAS A MAGIC MIRROR RECENTLY... WELL, IT HAD A LITTLE ACCIDENT. Leader: YOU? IT WAS YOU? DO YOU REALIZE WHAT YOU HAVE DONE? YOU HAVE DESTROYED ONE OF THE GREAT TRAVELING MIRRORS. WE WEREN'T EVEN... WAIT. DID YOU JUST SAY ONE OF THE TRAVELING MIRRORS? AS IN, THERE ARE OTHERS? DO YOU WISH TO SMASH THE OTHER TWO? NO, WE NEED THEM. WHERE CAN WE FIND THEM? YOU WILL FIND ONLY DEATH HERE. TAKE THEM TO THE OLD SHAFT AND THROW THEM IN! ( dwarves clamoring ) NO, NO, NO! LOOK, LOOK, WAIT! WAIT! LOOK! LOOK IN THE TRUTH MIRROR. LOOK! IT'S PRINCE WENDELL GRANDSON OF THE GREATEST WOMAN THAT'S EVER LIVED. THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S THE GUY. AND I AM HIS INDISPENSABLE TRANSLATOR. Dwarf: WHAT MAGIC IS THIS? WHO ARE YOU STRANGE TRAVELERS? WE'RE, UM... ON A SECRET MISSION TO RESTORE PRINCE WENDELL TO HIS ORIGINAL FORM. I'M A VERY IMPORTANT PERSON. LONG HAVE THE STORIES BEEN TOLD OF THIS DAY WHEN A PROUD PRINCE WOULD STAND BEFORE US ON FOUR LEGS. YEAH, WELL, THIS IS THE DAY. OH! I'VE BANGED MY SUCKING ELFING HEAD 200 TIMES. YOU SHOULD BE CAREFUL. OH, I HATE DWARVES. FIRST DWARF I SEE, I'LL KABOB HIM! YEAH! IF THEY SEE A TROLL THEY'LL BE ON YOU LIKE A PACK OF HOUNDS AND THEY'LL TEAR YOU LIMB FROM LIMB. SHUT UP! WHAT ARE WE, TROLLS OR MICE? WE'RE TROLLS! TROLLS AFRAID OF NOTHING! NOTHING! DWARVES HAVE MINED IN THESE CAVES FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS. IN THE EARLY DAYS WE SUFFERED TERRIBLE LOSSES BECAUSE THE CAVES WERE OVERRUN WITH DRAGONS. YOU SEE, THESE CAVES CONTAIN QUICKSILVER WHICH, I'M SURE YOU KNOW, MALE DRAGONS ARE ADDICTED TO. AH! THIS IS EXTREMELY QUICKSILVER. ORDINARY QUICKSILVER IS MUCH TOO SLOW FOR MAGIC MIRRORS. MOST ATTEMPTS TO MAKE A MAGIC MIRROR FAIL COMPLETELY. THEY JUST REFLECT. BUT SOMETIMES, WITH THE HELP OF GREAT DWARF EXPERTISE... OW! YOU'RE NOT SUFFERING FROM BAD LUCK, ARE YOU? WE'RE LOOKING FOR A TRAVELING MIRROR TO REPLACE THE ONE THAT WAS BROKEN. YEAH, WHICH WE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH. TRAVELING MIRRORS... I DOUBT IF OUR RECORDS GO THAT FAR BACK. YES... JUST AS I THOUGHT. THERE IS ONE OTHER SLENDER CHANCE. LET'S SEE IF WE CAN RAISE GUSTAV. COME. HE'S OVER THERE. GUSTAV, YOU HAVE A VISITOR. YOU HAVE TO SPEAK UP; HE'S RATHER DEAF. ( speaking loudly ): UM, GUSTAV, WE NEED TO ASK YOU A QUESTION. HMM? A QUESTION! ABOUT TRAVELING MIRRORS! AN ANSWER ONLY WILL I CHIME WHEN QUESTIONS PUT ARE ASKED IN RHYME. Librarian: ALL EARLY MIRRORS TALK IN VERSE. YES, OF COURSE. WERE THERE ANY OTHER TRAVELING MIRRORS MADE THAT COULD HELP US WITH OUR ESCAPADE? "ESCAPADE." THREE FINE MIRRORS THERE WERE MADE TO MAKE THEM, SUCH A PRICE WAS PAID. FINE, FINE. WHERE ARE THE OTHER TWO? HMM? UM, OUR MIRROR'S SMASHED; WHAT CAN WE DO? WHERE THE HELL ARE THE OTHER TWO? MIRROR ONE SHATTERED BIG... BY AN OAF CALLED ANTOPY. ( mumbling ) MIRROR TWO IS ON A BED WITH BARNACLES UPON ITS HEAD. A BED... WITH BARNACLES. THE SEABED. YES, ONE FELL INTO THE GREAT NORTHERN SEA. I THINK YOU CAN SAFELY DISCOUNT THAT ONE. WHAT YOU SEEK HAS NOT BEEN SEEN SINCE IT WAS STOLEN BY THE QUEEN. THE QUEEN? THAT'S ALL WE NEED. ANTHONY, UH... ANY CHANCE OF A LITTLE BISCUIT? NO, NO, NO, UM... UH, VERY, UH... VERY HELPFUL YOU HAVE, UH... UH... BEEN. JUST TELL US WHERE WE CAN FIND THE QUEEN. NEAR SHE IS BUT NOT ALONE IN A PLACE THAT'S NOT HER HOME IN A CASTLE OUT OF SIGHT WHERE ONCE THE QUEEN WAS CALLED SNOW WHITE. THAT'S PRINCE WENDELL'S CASTLE. ( hoofbeats approaching ) OH, I KNEW IT. I DON'T THINK... OH, NO, NO! MURDERERS! YOU'VE MURDERED MY MIRRORS! MIRROR MURDERERS! KILL THEM! KILL THEM! ( dwarves clamoring ) Virginia: GET OUT OF HERE! Librarian: QUICK! SOUND THE ALARM! ( alarm whistling ) ( whistle blowing ) WHAT WAS THAT? ( blowing louder ) ( panicked screaming ) WE NEED TO DISAPPEAR. COME ON, GO DOWN HERE. THEY WON'T FOLLOW US DOWN HERE. I'LL BE RIGHT BEHIND YOU. ( screaming ) OW! YOU OKAY? NO, I'M NOT OKAY! I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH MORE OF THIS I CAN TAKE. YOU'VE GOT TO BE MORE CAREFUL. IT'S NOT MY FAULT; IT'S MY BAD LUCK. ( hoofbeats approaching ) UGH! HOW MUCH WORSE IS IT GOING TO BE NOW? ( screaming ) DAD? DAD?! ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? ( groans ) I-I DID SOMETHING REALLY B... S-SOMETHING CRACKED. I CAN'T MOVE. ALL RIGHT, I'M GOING TO HELP YOU. TRY... AH, NO! NO! I MAY HAVE BROKEN MY BACK. OKAY. OKAY, UM... WELL, WE'RE GOING... WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER WAY OUT OF HERE. WE CAN'T GO BACK THE WAY WE CAME, SO, UM... I DON'T WANT TO DIE IN HERE. WE'RE NOT GOING TO DIE. WE'RE GOING TO FIND A WAY OUT OF HERE. I CAN'T HELP YOU. I CAN'T MOVE. WELL, THEN, I'M JUST GOING TO GO ON ALONE AND I'M GOING TO FIND A WAY OUT AND I'M GOING TO COME BACK AND GET YOU. OKAY? MAYBE PRINCE CAN SMELL OUT FRESH AIR, AND... TOO MANY TUNNELS. TOO MANY TUNNELS. YOU WON'T FIND YOUR WAY BACK. I WILL FIND A WAY OUT AND I WILL COME BACK AND GET YOU, OKAY? I PROMISE. I'M GOING TO LEAVE A TRAIL OF BREAD CRUMBS... SO THAT I CAN FIND YOU. VIRGINIA, VIRGINIA... MAKE SURE YOU GET YOURSELF OUT. I'M COMING BACK. ( whimpers ) ( Prince whines ) "FOR SEVEN MEN "SHE GAVE HER LIFE. "FOR ONE GOOD MAN... "SHE WAS HIS WIFE. "BENEATH THE ICE BY SNOW WHITE FALLS "THERE LIES... THE FAIREST OF THEM ALL." Snow White: VIRGINIA... HELLO, VIRGINIA. YOU LOOK TIRED. ARE YOU DEAD? WELL... YES. I THINK YOU'D HAVE TO SAY SO. I'M MORE INTO THE FAIRY GODMOTHER OCCASIONAL APPEARANCE SORT OF THING NOW. BUT I STILL HAVE INFLUENCE OVER THINGS AND I'VE BEEN PROTECTING YOU IN OTHER WAYS SHIELDING YOUR IMAGE FROM THE MIRRORS OF THE QUEEN. BUT SOON, VIRGINIA YOU'LL HAVE TO SEE AND BE SEEN. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. ( Prince barks ) HEY! ( laughs ) WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MY GRANDSON, HUH? I LIKE HIM. YES. I THINK BEING A DOG HAS BEEN VERY GOOD FOR HIM. BUT HE'S LOSING HIS MIND. THAT IS WHY YOU MUST NOW TAKE CHARGE. HE NEEDS YOU TO SAVE HIS KINGDOM. WE ALL DO. ME? NO. I THINK YOU HAVE THE WRONG PERSON. MMM... I HAVE THE RIGHT PERSON. I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU, VIRGINIA. YOU SEE MY MOTHER WAS A QUEEN AND EVERY DAY SHE WOULD SIT BY THE WINDOW, SEWING STARING AT THE FALLING SNOW, LONGING TO HAVE A BABY GIRL. AND ONE DAY SHE PRICKED HER FINGER ON A NEEDLE AND ONTO THE SNOW FELL THREE DROPS OF BLOOD AND SHE KNEW THEN THAT SHE WOULD DIE GIVING BIRTH TO ME. MY FATHER WAS SAD FOR A VERY LONG TIME BUT HE REMARRIED EVENTUALLY BECAUSE HE WAS LONELY AND MY NEW MOTHER BROUGHT NO POSSESSIONS TO THE CASTLE EXCEPT FOR HER MAGIC MIRRORS AND EVERY DAY SHE WOULD LOCK HER BEDROOM SHE WOULD TAKE OFF ALL HER CLOTHES AND SHE WOULD LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND SAY "MIRROR, MIRROR, ON THE WALL, WHO'S THE FAIREST OF THEM ALL?" AND THE MIRROR WOULD REPLY "MY LADY IS THE FAIREST OF THEM ALL." AND THIS WOULD SATISFY HER FOR SHE KNEW THAT MIRROR SPOKE THE TRUTH. BUT I WAS GROWING OLDER AND BY THE TIME I WAS SEVEN, I WAS AS PRETTY AS YOU. AND ONE DAY, WHEN THE QUEEN ASKED HER MIRROR THE MIRROR REPLIED, "MY LADY QUEEN IS FAIR TO SEE BUT SNOW WHITE IS FAIRER FAR THAN THEE." AND MY STEPMOTHER CALLED HER HUNTSMAN AND SAID "TAKE THIS CHILD INTO THE FOREST. I AM SICK OF THE SIGHT OF HER." CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT MOMENT, VIRGINIA? WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT YOU ARE SO AWFUL THAT YOUR OWN MOTHER WANTS YOU MURDERED? WHEN THE HUNTSMAN RAISED HIS KNIFE I FELL TO MY KNEES, AND I BEGGED HIM "LET ME LIVE. PLEASE... LET ME LIVE." AND HE PUT HIS KNIFE AWAY. I WAS SO TERRIFIED I RAN STRAIGHT INTO THE DARKNESS. I RAN UNTIL I WAS EXHAUSTED, AND THEN, RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME THERE WAS THIS LITTLE COTTAGE. OH, THE COTTAGE WE FOUND. YES, OF COURSE. AND WHEN I WENT INSIDE EVERYTHING WAS THE PERFECT SIZE FOR ME. ON THE TABLE, THERE WAS SET SEVEN PLATES AND, WHEN I WENT UPSTAIRS THERE WERE SEVEN BEDS, ALL IN A ROW. I WAS SO TIRED, I FELL FAST ASLEEP AND, WHEN I WOKE UP THERE WERE THESE MEN COMING UP THE STAIRS AND THEY HAD LAMPS. THEY WERE MINING LAMPS, SWINGING BACK AND FORTH LIKE FIREFLIES IN THE NIGHT AND I WAS FROZEN WITH FEAR AND, WHEN THEY SAW ME, THEY ALL SAID AS ONE "WHAT A LOVELY LITTLE GIRL." THEY TOLD ME THAT, IF I KEPT THE HOUSE CLEAN AND I DID THE COOKING AND THE WASHING AND THE SEWING AND THE KNITTING AND KEPT EVERYTHING SPOTLESS, THAT I COULD STAY AND I WOULD NEVER WANT FOR ANYTHING. I TOLD THEM ABOUT MY STEPMOTHER AND THEY BECAME VERY PARANOID ABOUT HER. THEY TOLD ME NEVER TO GO INTO TOWN AND NEVER TO OPEN THE DOOR TO STRANGERS. HER MIRRORS FOUND ME EVENTUALLY. SHE DRESSED AS AN OLD PEDDLER AND CLIMBED OVER THE SEVEN HILLS TO MY HOUSE. TWICE SHE CAME-- ONCE WITH A CORSET TO CRUSH MY RIBS AND THEN WITH A POISON COMB TO DRUG ME. BUT THE LAST TIME SHE CAME SHE BROUGHT THE MOST BEAUTIFUL BASKET OF APPLES THAT I EVER SAW AND THIS TIME SHE STAYED TO WATCH ME DIE AND TO BE SURE, SHE HELD ME IN HER ARMS UNTIL I DIED IN FRONT OF HER CHOKING ON A PIECE OF POISON APPLE. AND I OFTEN THINK... WHY DID I LET HER IN? DIDN'T I KNOW SHE WAS BAD? I DID. OF COURSE I DID. BUT I ALSO KNEW THAT I COULDN'T KEEP THE DOOR CLOSED ALL MY LIFE JUST BECAUSE IT WAS DANGEROUS JUST BECAUSE THERE WAS A CHANCE THAT I MIGHT GET HURT. TELL ME WHAT ALL THIS HAS TO DO WITH ME. EVERYTHING. YOU'RE COLD. YOU'RE COLD, VIRGINIA. HOW DID YOU BECOME SO COLD? YOU ARE STILL LOST IN THE FOREST BUT LONELY, LOST GIRLS LIKE US CAN RESCUE THEMSELVES. YOU ARE STANDING ON THE EDGE OF GREATNESS. NO, I'M NOT. I'M NOT. I'M NOTHING. I'M USELESS. YOU WILL ONE DAY BE LIKE ME. YOU WILL BE A GREAT ADVISER TO OTHER LOST GIRLS. NOW... STAND UP. STAND UP. THIS MIRROR WILL SHOW YOU WHAT YOU DO AND DO NOT WANT TO SEE. POISON IS THE WAY THE QUEEN WILL STRIKE AND THE WAY SHE MUST BE DEFEATED. YOU MUST FIND THE POISONED COMB SHE TRIED TO KILL ME WITH. BUT WHAT CAN I DO ALL BY MYSELF? DO NOT CLING TO WHAT YOU KNOW. DO NOT THINK... BECOME. OH, MY LIGHT'S GOING OUT. LET YOUR LIGHT GO OUT. EMBRACE THE DARKNESS. NO, BUT I CAN'T FIND MY WAY OUT IN THE DARK! YOU MAY ASK FOR ONE WISH AND I WILL TRY AND GRANT IT BUT BE SURE TO ASK FOR THE RIGHT THING. OKAY. I WISH... I WISH THAT DAD'S BAD LUCK WAS OVER OH, AND THAT HIS BACK WASN'T BROKEN ANYMORE! STRICTLY SPEAKING, THAT'S TWO WISHES... BUT IT'S DONE. ( chittering ) YOUR FATHER IS IN GREAT DANGER. YOU MUST GO TO HIM. OKAY, BUT HOW DO I FIND...? NO. GO TO HIM NOW. IMMEDIATELY. ( footsteps crunching ) OH! OH... VIRGINIA! I WAS JUST ABOUT TO LOSE MY MIND. I'D JUST ABOUT GIVEN UP ALL HOPE. THAT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. ( whispering ): OH, MY GOD. I MOVE SLOWLY BUT I ALWAYS GET WHAT I WANT. WHERE'S THE DOG... CALLED PRINCE? WHERE'S THE GIRL? JUST GO TO HELL. ( gasps ) I WILL NOT ASK YOU AGAIN. GO AHEAD, KILL ME. I DON'T EVEN CARE ANYMORE. YOU WILL TELL ME... EVERYTHING LONG BEFORE YOU DIE. ( groans ) GET UP AND COME WITH ME. BUT I-I CAN'T GET UP. MY BACK IS BROKEN. NO, IT'S NOT. WHAT DO YOU...? HEY! IT DOES FEEL BETTER. OH, MY GOD, HOW DID THAT HAPPEN? I HAVE FOUND THE MOST WONDERFUL THING. WHAT? YOU FOUND THE WAY OUT? BETTER. BETTER? WH...? YOU MEAN, THERE'S SOMETHING BETTER THAN THE WAY OUT? YES. WHAT? OH, UH, COME ON. LOOK. WHAT? NO. IT-IT-IT... SHE WAS HERE. BUT IT WAS... WHAT? SO DID YOU FIND THE WAY OUT? YES. WELL, W-WAIT-WAIT... WHAT ARE YOU DOING? SHH! LISTEN. ( distant rumble ) CAN YOU HEAR THAT? HEAR...? ( water dripping ) OH... ( rumbling increasing ) ( Virginia laughing ) WE DID IT! OH, TERRIFIC! COME ON. OOH! I THINK... I THINK WE'RE BACK IN THE FOURTH KINGDOM. OH. WHERE'D YOU GET THAT? MIRROR, MIRROR, IN MY HAND WHO'S THE FAIREST IN THE LAND? IT'S... CHRISTINE. NO. NO. IT CAN'T BE. WHAT? IT'S HER. MY GOD, THAT'S YOUR MOTHER. OH! SOMEONE IS WATCHING ME. IT'S MOM. THAT'S MOM! UH, BUT WAIT! ( echoing ) WAIT, WAIT... SOMEONE IS SPYING ON ME. NO, NO, NO. IT CAN'T BE. THAT PER... THAT WAS MOM. SHE'S HERE? HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE? I THOUGHT YOU SAID SHE WAS LIVING IN MIAMI. I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE SHE WAS. I HAD TO TELL YOU SOMETHING. YOU WERE ALWAYS ASKING ME. AND WHY DID YOU THROW THE MIRROR AWAY? I MEAN... WELL, BECAUSE, IF WE COULD SEE HER, IT MEANS... MAYBE SHE CAN SEE US, AND... AND-AND WHAT? W-WHAT DO YOU THINK SHE'S GOING TO DO? I DON'T KNOW. HOW DID SHE GET HERE? SHE'S GOT THE OTHER MIRROR. Repair and Synchronization by Easy Subtitles Synchronizer 1.0.0.0
