 Mrs. Garrett, would you like some avocado spread? Oh, no, thanks, dear. I have my own avocado spread. Sue Ann, aren't you coming up? I need help with this history test. Nancy, what are you going to do when your boyfriend proposes? Call Sue Ann for the answer? I can't help it. When it comes to schoolwork, Sue Ann is my security blanket. Come on, Nancy. We'll study together. What subject should we start with first? Good morning, everybody. Where is everybody? Upstairs studying, Mr. Bradley. Oh. What are you reading? How to Fly an Airplane. You? Why do you want to learn to fly? 'Cause I'm scared of flying, and I'm ashamed of myself. As a kid, I was absolutely fearless. When I was nine, I won a bet jumping off the top of the barn into a pile of hay. You must have been a fun date. I was. Blair. Studying. Bye. So I took my "trip to Hong Kong" money... and signed up for flying lessons. And, Mr. Bradley, I'm having one heck of a time. I'll bet you are. I've already logged 20 hours. And tomorrow I solo. Good luck. Good morning. Good morning, Miss Mahoney. Mr. Bradley, here's a copy of my history exam for tomorrow. Ah, yeah. And I think this is yours. It was delivered to me by mistake. Oh! Thank you! These are the girls' I.Q. scores from their previous schools. Oh, I am so proud. Our girls have the highest I.Q. of any prep school in the state. Mr. Bradley, how can you put so much importance to an intelligence test... that was taken way back in grade school? Mrs. Garrett, if you were in the education biz, you'd understand. You see, by fifth grade, every child has reached his or her permanent I.Q. level. I'm not going too fast for you, am I? It's not that coldhearted, Mrs. Garrett. It's only a guideline. And the child never sees the I.Q. score. Mr. Bradley! Tootie! Tootie! Are you all right? Yeah! I landed on my soft part. Miss Tracey's giving a geometry test... and she sent me to find one of you. - What's the problem? - She has to go to the bathroom. I didn't know we were on the buddy system. Mr. Bradley, I would love to be able to help out, but I've got to get back to my biology lab. I've got eight rabbits in trouble. I'll be glad to go for you, Mr. Bradley. No, you're a little softhearted to play a watchdog. I'll do it. But would you cover the phones in my office? Glad to. ♪ Off we go into the wild blue yonder ♪ "Stanford-Binet I.Q. scores." For everybody in school? Sure didn't know she was the smartest. Or she was the dumbest! Sue Ann, can you fill me in on the Louisiana Purchase? Sure. The Louisiana Territory was purchased on April 30, 1803. It cost us almost $16 million. Wow. That's a lot of money! They probably just charged it. I have a secret that none of us is supposed to know. What is it, Tootie? I know who the smartest girl in the school is. Wait a minute. That's no secret. Everyone knows it's Sue Ann. Oh, well, not necessarily, Nancy. Sue Ann's right. It's not her. See? Didn't I tell you? Who is the smartest? Well, it couldn't be me. I've got too many other things going for me. You're right, Blair. It's not you either. Oh. It's Nancy. No. I'm not the smartest. Don't be so stupid. I just told you so. How do you know all this? I found a confidential list with all of our I.Q.'s on it. I wrote 'em down. Let me see it! Not so fast! Sheesh! I'll show you your scores one at a time. That's not fair. Why should you know all our scores and not us? 'Cause I can keep a secret. Cindy. All right! Molly. Nancy. And Natalie. You and me have the same I.Q. score. I knew we were soul sisters. Hey, Blair, you want to see your I.Q.? Great. My I.Q. is higher than my weight. I don't believe it! Sue Ann has the lowest I.Q. on the list! May I see it? Congratulations, Nancy, on being so smart. Sue Ann, it's not that big a deal. That's easy for you to say. Sue Ann, don't be upset because you're the dumbest girl in school. I have a friend whose brother has even a lower I.Q. than you. He got all the way through junior college, and now he's the most successful dog catcher in Paramus, New Jersey. Thanks. Maybe I can work my way up to being manager of a lemonade stand. Sue Ann, you're being ridiculous. You've always gotten good grades, and this isn't going to change anything. Yeah, and if you need help, to study, Tootie and I will be glad to tutor you. It'll cost you. Hi, girls. Sue Ann, you're so good at math. Could you help me with this flying problem? Boy, did you come to the wrong person for help. Sue Ann. That's real funny, isn't it, girls? Sue Ann? Girls, what's going on here? What is this? Uh, it feels like a piece of paper, Mrs. Garrett. Tootie. This couldn't possibly be the list of I.Q. scores, could it? No, Mrs. Garrett, not possibly... Definitely. Tootie, is there something you think you should do about this? Yeah. Make a break for it. Okay, let's go to Mr. Bradley's office. All right, honey. I'll roll you down that last mile. Oh! Excuse me. I'm sorry. Was I interrupting your homework? No. Of course not, Sue Ann. It's time for a little maintenance anyway. For both of us. Let's taxi over to the bed. I'm sorry about the way I acted before, Mrs. Garrett. I was really rude. No, you weren't. I heard Tootie's gonna be punished for peeking at the I.Q. scores. She sure is. She's gonna have to write "I shall not be nosy" 500 times on the blackboard. That'll keep her busy for a few minutes. What's the matter, Sue Ann? Oh, you're not still worried about that silly I.Q. stuff, are you? It's not silly, Mrs. Garrett. I was the dumbest on the list, and everybody knows it. Oh, Sue Ann. Tomorrow I solo. I'm gonna be up there flying all by myself. If Tootie should suddenly hand me a low I.Q. score, what do you think I'd say? You'd say, "Tootie, what the heck you doin' up here?" For sure. Sue Ann, you're an excellent student. You always do beautifully on your exams. This I.Q. thing... There's nothing to it. It doesn't mean a thing. It doesn't if you're at the top of the list, like Nancy. And I don't hear her complaining. Come on, Nancy. Don't be so selfish. Share your brain. Blair, you're the fifth one that's come to me, and I can't help you. I'll be lucky if I pass this test myself. Check with Sue Ann. She knows everything. When I want help I go to the best, and that's you. I don't care what my I.Q. is. I don't wanna be the smartest girl in school. You should be proud to be number one. I liked it better when Sue Ann was number one and everyone went to her for the answers. Now everyone's coming to me, and I can't take the pressure! Now, Blair, will you please leave so I can study? Well! You don't see me getting all upset when people tell me how gorgeous I am. Oh, uh, didn't Miss Mahoney post the exam scores yet? What are you asking me for? You've got eyes. Can't you answer a simple question? I mean, you are the smartest girl in school. Get off my case, will you? What are you so uptight about? A girl with your I.Q. shouldn't have had any trouble with that simple test. Are you kidding? I panicked. I had to guess at half the answers. I hope I guessed right. Okay, come off it, will you, Nancy? We all know you're a brain. I hate people who pretend like a test is hard for them... just so the other people won't feel so dumb. If you don't like it, tough. Okay, Sue Ann? And I'm sick and tired of hearing how high my I.Q. is, so just cut it out! I'd give anything to have your problem. You're on top. How would you like to know you're gonna spend the rest of your life in the basement? I'd trade with you in a minute. Show me how, and you've got a deal. Sue Ann, I like the way it used to be. So do I. I can't handle being up there all by myself. It's pretty miserable being down here too. I wish they had never invented I.Q.'s. What are you two looking so intense for? Hey, exams come and go. Worry lines stay with you forever. I wasn't talking about you. Well, girls, wish me luck. I'm off to the airfield for my first solo. And I've got a beautiful day for it too. What's the matter with you two? We took our midterms this morning. Well, you always do great on exams. I'm sure you did well. Well, midterms are over. You can all relax. You've got nothing to do for the next three months but study for finals. Miss Mahoney, please do me a favor. Tell these girls they did okay on their exams so they can relax. I wish I could. I even double-checked your scores. - We didn't do so hot, huh? - You failed. Nancy, you obviously guessed at half the answers. I tightened up. I couldn't think. And, Sue Ann, I don't know where your mind was. You gave answers where there weren't even questions. I don't know what to say. With all this I.Q. fuss, no wonder you had a rough time taking that test. Don't worry. Next time... There won't be a next time, Mrs. Garrett, because I'm gonna leave Eastland. - What? - Who am I kidding? It's just gonna keep getting harder, and I'm not up to it. Nancy, will you help me talk some sense into her? I don't think I'd be very convincing, Mrs. Garrett. I'm going to leave Eastland too. ♪ Toot-toot, Tootie Good-bye ♪ ♪ Toot-toot, Tootie Don't cry ♪ ♪ Toot-toot, Tootie Good-bye ♪ ♪ Toot-toot, Tootie Don't cry ♪♪ Tootie. Dittos are not satisfactory. Dittos don't slice it, huh? Start over. Can I help it if I'm years ahead of my time? Mr. Bradley, I've been looking all over for you. Well, you've found me. What do you want? These girls are so upset with your I.Q. foolishness... that they're packing to leave school. Nancy and Sue Ann? What's the matter? - I'm not smart enough to be at Eastland. - I can't handle the pressure. They both flunked the midterms, thanks to you. I am sorry the girls did poorly on their test, but I don't think we should go overboard and blame their I.Q.'s. It would be dishonest to say that I.Q.'s meant nothing. And I don't see any great harm in the girls knowing their scores. Does that mean I'm free to go? Make it a round trip, Tootie. We all can't have the same I.Q's. If a girl has a lower score, then she knows she's gotta push that much harder to get the same results. It's simple. I'm not going too fast for you, am I, Sue Ann? See? You're just like the rest of 'em, Mr. Bradley. I'm ashamed of my I.Q., and I hate that everybody knows what it is. - That's why I'm leaving. - Me too. All of a sudden, everyone expects too much from me. ♪♪ Hello. What's going on here? We're just having a little discussion about I.Q.'s. Yes, the girls are upset. It all started when everybody knew about everybody else's I.Q. I'm comforting them. You're making great progress. Mr. Bradley, you know what would be really comforting to the girls? If you would share your I.Q. score with them. Well, gladly. I'll write away to my grade school tomorrow. What? I.Q.'s are so important, and you don't know yours? Well, not offhand. Really? Well, then we're even. I doubt that. One score is bound to be higher than the other. Or lower. Anything is possible. Tell me, Mr. Bradley. Would you be bothered if my I.Q. were higher than yours? - Of course not. - Good. Let's take our I.Q. test together, right now. Well, I'd love to, but that's impossible. - The school doesn't have any I.Q. tests. - Yes, we do, Mr. Bradley. They sent a sample I.Q. test with those scores you sent away for. Thank you, Miss Mahoney. Let's get started! This is usually a written exam. It'll be harder taking it orally. - It's all right with me, Mr. Bradley. - Child's play. Very well. I'll administer the exam. Uh, no, Mr. Bradley. Sit there, please. An open seat prevents temptation. I'm going to read a set of five words. I want you to write down the two that are most similar. Ready? - Ready. - Ready. "Pen. Chicken. Gold. Rifle. Paper." - Uh-huh. - Uh-huh. Next set. Remember the two that are most similar. "Tearing. Melting. Running. Burning. Canoeing." Of course! - Ready? - Ready? Pick a pair. "Singing. Coughing. Marching. Eating. Sleeping." They get easier. Do you mind? Yes, Mr. Bradley? Was that, um, singing, coughing, melting, canoeing? No, Mr. Bradley. Melting and canoeing were from the previous set. Uh... Do we have wandering eyes, Mr. Bradley? We are now moving to the vocabulary section. Write down the meaning of the following words. "Sudorific." Ah. I never knew that word would come in handy. Mrs. Garrett, I object to your little murmurings. I'm trying to take a test here. Could we continue? Write down the meaning of this word: "octillion." Octillion. Now, there is a word. Easy. Don't put down, "A kind of dance," 'cause that's a cotillion. That's all. That's it. This is over. It is totally ridiculous. This test does not mean a thing! I.Q. tests don't mean a thing, huh? Interesting theory. Well, I was under pressure. This is not a normal testing situation. Okay, I choked. You may be right. It is possible for people to do poorly on an I.Q. test... Even those of us who are exceptionally gifted. You see, girls? I hope you were really listening. You can't live life by the numbers. And that's all an I.Q. really is. I have to admit it. You might be right. Especially after this. In all the years that they have given I.Q. tests, no one has really been able to prove that a high or low I.Q. score... has anything to do with what a person can accomplish. There you go. Girls, what really counts is how you use your abilities... and how hard you try. Isn't that right, Mr. Bradley? Or are we going too fast for you? What? Oh, of course not. Okay, Mrs. Garrett. You're finally getting through, even to me. Me too. Maybe I could take the test over and do as badly as Mr. Bradley. Don't expect to equal this, unless you're willing to go without sleep for weeks. Well, Mrs. Garrett, if it'll make anybody feel any better, you can post that test on your bulletin board. I'd like to have another chance at that test under normal conditions. Great idea. And I assume the girls could take their midterms exam over again, under normal conditions? Oh, yeah, could we? Please? Oh, really? Wonderful. I'm glad we thought of it. Miss Mahoney, you'll do the honors? Girls, it would be my pleasure. See me at 3:00. Gotta fly. Gotta fly. Fly? I'm late for my flying test. I gotta take off... all by myself. Oh, that's right. Nancy, if Mrs. Garrett has the courage to fly a plane all by herself, we should be able to retake that history test with no problem. Yeah, we'll ace it. Right. Thanks, girls. You've inspired me. Watch out, Red Baron. Here I come! Oh, dear. Oh. Bye-bye! I bet this time I'll get a 95 on the test. And I bet I'll get a 96. Oh, great. Things are back to normal. - Will you help me study? - Sure.
