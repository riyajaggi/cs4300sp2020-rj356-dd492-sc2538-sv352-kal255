No! Who was in this when you got it? Nobody. That would've spoiled the fun.

 Tootie, you still have a lot to learn. Natalie! Tootie! My goodness. Blair! Blair! Oh, I missed you so much. Look at you... uglier than ever. I don't believe what I see: Blair Warner with only one suitcase. What do you mean? This is just for my makeup. My wardrobe is coming later in a truck. Did you hear about Mrs. Garrett's new job? She's been promoted to school dietitian. Wow. What an honor... runnin' the whole "barfeteria." Arnold! Come back here. Arnold! You've gotta give the cook back his lobster. Nobody's gonna boil my friend Claude. He's too cute to die. Cute? With those beady little eyes and all those wiggly claws? Mrs. Garrett, you just insulted my pet. Claude, I'd cover your ears, but I don't know where they are. All right, Arnold. That's enough. Uh... Natalie. Blair! Tootie! Mrs. Garrett! Mrs. Garrett! - Goodness! You've grown! - You are so thin! Yeah. What happened to the other half of you? I lost 25 big ones. Whoo! You look terrific. How did you lose it? It's the new inflation diet. You eat what you can afford. Hi, Arnold. What are you doin' up here? Ah, Tootie. It's about time you noticed me. Yeah. Well, school's out for a couple of days in the city, so my boyfriend came up to pay me a visit. Now, cool it, Mrs. Garrett. Tootie might get the idea that I'm not available, which I definitely am. Uh, would you like to help me feed my friend Claude? Sure. Okay. Good. Maybe you can help me find his mouth. - What has gotten into Arnold? - Well, you've had biology. Figure it out. What on earth's goin' on out there? Sounds like The Wild Bunch. Uh, is this where I'm supposed to be? Uh, delivery boys usually use the rear entrance. Delivery boy? Gimme a break. This is where I'm supposed to check in? I don't believe this. You don't? I was gonna ask him to the fall dance. Ooh! Hi. I'm Mrs. Garrett, the school dietitian. You must be... Jo, the new student. - Right. How'd ya know? - Easy. I've never seen... a motorcycle parked in my flower bed before. Oh. I thought they were weeds. She must think we're into nostalgia. She's still wearing flared jeans. Uh, in a minute, you're gonna be wearin' flared teeth. Wait, wait, wait. Don't punch a total stranger. Introduce yourselves first. Hi. I'm Natalie Green, and I wear flared jeans myself. In fact, all of my clothes are flared! Blair. Blair Warner. Charmed. Gloria Vanderbilt. Oh, hey, your hand's dirty. You better go have it steam cleaned or somethin'. Why, you little... Uh, speaking of dormitory assignments... - Huh? - Well, they're up on the bulletin board. I thought you'd like to see who you're rooming with. I can't even pronounce the one they put me with. "'Joanne' Pol-nee-ah-zek." I hope she brings along an interpreter to help me with that name. It's "Polniaczek." You? And I got your interpreter right here. Nobody jokes about my name. You know, they really don't have to. There's enough laughs in the way you act. Would you girls care for a bowl of Meow Mix? Natalie, show Jo a better place to park her motorcycle, huh? Why don't I just park it on Blair's face? She's a breath of fresh air, isn't she? This must be an unlucky day for Geminis for me to get stuck with "Cheryl Thug." Luck had nothing to do with it. I'm the one who suggested it. Mrs. Garrett, I thought you were my friend. How could you? Because you're very special. Well? And so is Jo. Her? Special? At what, mud wrestling? She's very bright. Oh, she did really well on her entrance exams. That thing's a breeze. I got a 96 on it. She got a 98. Jo was doin' really great in public school, till her dad left home a couple of years ago. That's when her problems began. Her mother had to work double shifts, and Jo met a boy who got her into trouble. Not that kind of trouble. Truancy... staying out till all hours, cutting class. Great, and I get to be her keeper. Her friend. Blair, you know, I've always felt that when someone's got their act together, they ought to help someone who doesn't. Oh, I don't know. I don't think I can live... Oh, come on. Blair, she can learn so much from you. You're so... so warmhearted, compassionate, sensitive. Oh, let's face it, Blair. You're just about perfect in every way. What can I say? When you're right, you're right. Really, I'm sorry I mashed your flowers. Ah. Here. You wanna use some of my electric tape on those daisies? Oh, no, thanks, honey. Oh, by the way, they were marigolds. Right. Marigolds. What do I know about flowers? In my neighborhood, the state flower's asphalt. Not a bad place ya got. Well, thank you. I'd rather even be with you than with, uh, Blairsy in Snob-o City. But it's good to learn to live with new people. That's what school life is all about. But she's not for real. She's a Barbie doll. I mean, you wind her up, and she says, "I love you" to herself. Don't jump to conclusions about Blair. You don't even know her. Hi. Am I interrupting anything? Oh, no. Come in. Come in. Um, I have to check the dinner menu. Besides, you two roomies must have millions of things to talk about. So, I hope you're gonna stay. I'm sure we'll make great roommates. So Garrett's been workin' on ya, huh? Ah, okay. Mrs. Garrett did say a few words in passing, but it was only to remind me of that Eastland spirit. And what's that... "Slumming builds character"? No. It's "honesty." Look. I'm not saying you're my idea of the perfect roommate. That'd be Prince Charles. Yeah? Well, you don't win any popularity contest with me neither. Good. I see we agree on something. Yeah. That, and I'm wearin' last year's jeans. I apologize for that remark. I admit I sometimes do pay a bit too much attention to fashion. And me, not enough. How about it? Wanna try bunking together for a while? Well, it wouldn't kill me. Okay. My jeans are kinda old and ripped. What's the difference? My Jordaches are your Jordaches. Oh, thanks. You mean, you don't mind me takin' 'em in? And this is where me and Mrs. Garrett bunk together. Uh, excuse me. This room is taken. You're gonna have to see the manager. Hi, Blair. I haven't met your new roommate. Let me do the honors. Tootie, new roommate. Bye-bye. Oh, Arnold, are you leaving? Good. Us girls can have some girl talk. Now, how'd that happen? Bye, Arnold. It's been fun seeing you. You touched my hand. I'll never wash it again. That's sweet, Arnold. No big deal though. I wasn't gonna wash it anyway. Later, baby. Willis told me to say that. That's mine. Hi. I'm Tootie. Hi. Jo. Uh, sorry for spoiling things with you and your boyfriend. Boyfriend? Puh-lease. I'm only helping Arnold through his delusions of maturity. So, uh, what do you do for men around here? Just in time for the good stuff. Blair, tell her about Bates Academy... preppy heaven. It's our brother school. It's only a mile away. I'll fix you up. Gimme a break, huh? I'm talkin' about men, not high school boys. These aren't boys. I happen to be dating a senior who happens to be 19. He's slow, but cute. You're gonna make the perfect roommate. I'll take the men, and you can have their little brothers. - Oo-oo-ooh! - Not that this is worth discussing, but since we are roommates and being so frank and honest, there isn't a man around who wouldn't prefer a Rolls-Royce to a motorbike. This is gonna get good! You know, you are kinda like a Rolls-Royce hood ornament, but guys don't dig little angels dipped in chrome. Did I lie? Fortunately for you, we don't move in the same circles, or I could show you which one of us a real man would go for. Oh, it'd be easy to show her, Blair... at the Chugalug Bar on the highway. - It's just loaded with college guys. - Perfect. - Thanks, Tootie. - Don't mention it. Listen. I'd go in a minute, but we can't get into the bar. We're both underage, and they ask for I.D.'s. So? We'll give 'em I.D.'s. You're not 18. That I.D. is faked. Yeah. I do beautiful work, don't I? And I always carry a spare that I can fake for you. All's I need is a picture. It's simple. Simple for you, but... my goodness, which picture will I use? This one's nice. I'm smiling without being too toothy. Ah, this one's at the height of my tan. Coconut oil. No, no, no. This is it. This is it. I'm wearing sizzling pink Lip Quencher. I don't know. This one's pretty marvelous. Maybe... Who cares? Is it a deal or isn't it? It's a deal. Oh, good. Then you decided to room together? They're gonna do all kinds of things together. Great. I'm willing to bet that before long, they'll be double datin'. Bet, bet! I think we better be getting back to the dorm. Oh, so long. Bye, Mrs. Garrett. Bye-bye. Wonderful to have you back. See you later. Kids. They fight, but when they make up, it's worth it. We'll sneak out tonight after dinner, okay? Okay. Yeah. We'll be ready. We? Would you like to explain that? Sure. See, "we" is the first person plural pronoun. Me and Nat are a "we," and we are goin' with you. Hey, we cannot pass the two of you for 18. I know that. We'll spy through the window. Yeah, like watching "R" rated television. My first shot at voyeurism. Absolutely not. Now just forget it. Okay, Blair. It's your decision. Just remember: Leave me behind, and you also leave my mouth. - Would she squeal? - Are you kidding? Around here she's known as Speak Up, America. - I think we better take 'em. - That's okay with me. Wait a minute. I just thought of something. We can't go through with this. Why not, Blair? The Chugalug Bar is five miles away, and I'm not riding on the back of your motorbike. Oh, that's no sweat. I noticed the van parked outside. The cafeteria van? The keys are never in it. Who needs a key? Tonight you're gonna get your first lesson in hot-wirin'. Hot-wiring? Don't be stupid. The van already has a heater. I'm talkin' about touchin' a couple of ignition wires together. You mean, steal the van? Wow. This is gonna be some kind of semester. ♪♪ The van is fine there. Would you hurry? Hurry up. I am hurryin'. I never walked in four-inch heels before. Who told you to wear jeans with heels anyway? Very tacky. Boy, there's some cute guys in there. Send out the leftovers. I'm ready if you are. Why don't you go first? Sure, unless you want to. No. No, no, no. It's not that. I just... You know... Will you two stop yakking? Go in there and get some studs! ♪♪ Hi. Hi. Hi. Um, I guess you wanna see our I.D.'s, huh? Yeah, well, if you wanna come inside. Okay. Oh, well. Here's mine. I didn't take speed reading. - Wait a minute. - Why? What's the matter? I've never seen such a good picture on an I.D. before. Great tan. Oh. Thanks. Coconut oil. ♪♪ - Waitress? - Not bad. Gorgeous. But I'm afraid he might be a little old for you. Are you crazy? Two brews. One brew. I'll have a beer. Hi. I'm Brad. Hi. Blair. Jo. Well, now, who says the beautiful ones never travel in pairs? Hey, Arnold. Why the long face? I've been here six hours, and I only spent six minutes with Tootie. At this rate, I'll be 90 before we get it on. Well, now, we could have gone bowling together. I told you Tootie was gonna be busy settling in with the other girls. Hmm. Settling in? Those girls? Huh. I'd laugh, but I've made previous plans to throw up. What are you talkin' about? Those girls settlin' in. They're not even here. Well, where are they? In the fast lane, enjoying life, treatin' me like I was a little kid on a bike path in a kiddie car. Arnold, slow down and park it. Now, what's goin' on? Tootie told me you knew about it. - Well, I'll tell you after I hear it. - Okay. I was downstairs in the kitchen with my lobster friend Claude, makin' sure the cook didn't commit thermidor, when all of a sudden I hear someone outside messin' with the van. Messin' with the van? Who? Tootie and company. They got the motor started without a key. - Hot-wiring? - You saw it on the Today show too, huh? Oh, I don't believe it. They wouldn't do a thing like... It's gone! In 60 seconds... give or take 20 minutes of fussing and cussing. I don't believe it. Did they say where they were goin'? It was the strangest name I ever heard. It was called the "Thingamajig" or the "Slugabug." The Chugalug. Maybe. That's close. Watch TV. Watch something happy. ♪♪ So what college you girls from? It's nowhere near here. You know, the one up the road. Ah, different schools, huh? Well, let me guess. I'm pretty good at this sort of thing. You're easy. 'Ey! Yeah. Sure. You got last year's jeans, that "couldn't be bothered" hairstyle, just a touch of punk in those high heels. You go to Sarah Lawrence, right? Oh, really. Right. For sure. Hmm. Now, Blair, here... She's much tougher to figure out. If you only knew how many men have told me that. You got great makeup, perfect hairdo. Everything you're wearin' is straight out of Vogue. You're in secretarial school. Secretarial school? Gimme a break. Then it's beauty college. I'm never wrong about these things, babe. Well, you happen to be wrong this time, you low-class creep. Blair? Blair, this is not the way to come on to a guy. Uh-uh. Have you ever heard of Warner Textile Mills? Oh. That's why you're so sensitive. You're a workin' girl. So what do you operate... a loom or somethin' like that? You jerk. I own the place! Uh-oh. That guy's giving Blair a hard time. She's freaking. He must have said something awful. I'm going in. They won't let you in there. We'll tell 'em we're very small Avon Ladies. Hey! Okay, turkey. What did you say to our friend? Tootie, Natalie, get out of here. Who are these kids? Uh... Oh! Oh, they're my little sisters. - Girls! - Mrs. Garrett! Will you tell me what's goin' on here? Group sleepwalking? Blair, I want an explanation. Well, Mrs. Garrett, we were just lettin' off some steam. You know how tough the first day of school can be... Getting settled and meeting new people. And now comes Miller time! I don't think so, girls. It's, uh, time for a full introduction. Officer Shuler, Peekskill Police. - Police? - Oh, no. - What blew our cover? - It was probably those ridiculous shoes. Don't blame her, honey. I was on your case... the minute you came through that door with your fake I.D.'s. Officer. Officer, um, uh, these girls are from Eastland School. Now... you know the nutty things high school kids can do. I'm sorry, ma'am, but sometimes a lesson at this age is just what they need. Come on, you two. Wait a minute. You can't just say, "Book 'em," and forget it. Lady, nobody says, "Book 'em." That's Hawaii Five-O. They're not criminals. They're harmless high school kids. Okay, so they sipped a little beer. That's an offense. Oh, I know it wasn't right, faking their I.D.'s. That's another offense. But it's no crime to sneak away from school. Of course, to steal the school van is a crime. They stole the school van? Borrowed. Borrowed. Don't put words in my mouth. By the way, girls, where is the van? Don't worry, Mrs. Garrett. I-I'm sure that wasn't it. Yeah. We parked it real carefully right outside. Hey, that's no street. That's a one-way alley. We are in trouble! Harmless high school girls? Ha! I gotta take these two in before they do any more damage. Come on. Oh, no. Wait a minute. You can't do that. It's entrapment. - Leave my friends alone! - Yeah, creep! All right. That's it! I'm gonna put you all in jail. Let's get goin'. Come on.
