 Sit. The sooner we begin... the sooner you can start. What do you want? Good. Yes. All right. Sit. Here... are the questions. Your answers must be honest and simple, yes or no,

 unless otherwise directed. Hm? What is this? Why am I here? I've been watching you, Jill. You seem to have the qualities required. For what? Let's begin. James Baxter. James Baxter. Hey. James Baxter. That's the name? Yeah. Yeah.

 That's the name McCullough gave me. Is that him? I don't know. McCullough didn't show me a picture. He said he was a naturalist. Vanished a decade ago. I have to go see if he's the Earth Wu. Hey, uh... turn up the heat, please. - It's up. - Higher. I haven't been cold in 15 years. So how're you gonna do it? Handling the, uh... Earth Wu? None of your business, until I tell you it is. You better be prepared to kill him. You're not invincible. You can be defeated. I defeated you. You had an advantage. I didn't want you dead. You walk in there without a plan... you won't walk out. That's all I'm saying. A pristine landscape is destroyed by fire. This is a tragedy. Agree... or disagree? - I don't know what you're asking. - Do you agree? Uh... No? You find a fissure in a large rock. Inside that fissure is a colony of ants. Do you... Jill! Jill! Wait... What? Wait, where are you going? You can't leave me here! You can't just hold me here! If you make another sound, I will have to bury you alive. Hey, you trying to hit every bump? Slow down, you're making me nauseous. You're still recovering from the Gu. Okay, let me drive. I don't think so. Why, you don't trust me? Even after I let you rip that thing out of my chest, you don't trust me. - I'm working on it. - Huh. You just can't let go, can you? Now that you've got control. You don't know what Chinatown was like before I took over. I saw you kill a man. I know what that was like. I did everything I could to shield you from that life. Yeah, I killed men. Bad men. To keep you and everyone in Chinatown safe. I made all the hard choices, so you wouldn't have to make 'em. You know, I didn't choose to become the Fire Wu, Kai, any more than you chose - to become the Wu Assassin. - You didn't choose the power. You chose how to use it. When we find the Earth Wu... you're gonna have to kill him. I know. Killing changes a man. It will change you. Stop the car. Stop the car! You okay? Yeah. Yeah. It's just the Gu. Hello? Hi, I'm, uh... looking for my girlfriend. I think she's lost. Oh. - You have a phone, or... - No. Oh. You don't have a phone? Doesn't work out here. No. It wouldn't. How long has she been gone? Couple of hours now. We're camped down that way, about a half mile south of West Loop. - You haven't seen anybody? - No, nobody. No. Okay. Mind if I come in and just take a look around? Look, I'm gonna need to see inside your place, okay? - Jill's not here. - What? How do you... How do you know her name? Voices carry. I heard you calling. She's not... here. Well... Why don't you come on in and see for yourself? Well, come on. - Okay. - Hm? They'll come looking for me, you know. My boyfriend, the police. Whatever it is you think you're doing, they'll find you. You can't do this to people. You're sick. You need help. Let me help you. Let's resume, shall we? [Uncle Six[ Order me sausage and eggs. I'm gonna get some clean clothes. Right here... Couple of foreigners, too... Oh! Did they? Yeah, these guys must be lost or somethin'. It's all they got. Just get a side order! You know, I dated him. People do that... It must have put him in a different environment. I know, but sometimes when we're with a friend, you know... Besides... Because... Let me talk.. Oopsie. Forgot your side. - Sausage, right? - Yes, thank you. If you'd like anything else, we can have the cook whip up something in the kitchen. No, we're good. Thank you. He could probably do an Asian chicken thing, if that sounds good? We've got some rice back there. We can have that... We are fine. Thank you. Suit yourself. Just trying to be nice. Obviously, you're not from around here. Oregon, you mean? America. I do have one question. You calling me a hick? The Chinese came to this country in the 19th century, originally as railroad workers... and then to work in the mines. Those were the only jobs open to them. Now, we weren't accepted as Americans, so much so that Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act, as well as the Geary Act, the only US law ever to prevent naturalization on the basis of race. It wasn't until World War II, 61 years later, that we even had the option of becoming citizens, owning land, and marrying a white person. It may surprise you to know I'm as American as you are, as well as my son. Despite how we may look to you. So we're gonna stick with the eggs and sausage. Ass. Sorry, did you want the Asian chicken? I can't believe what he said. Hey! How you feelin' there, Al? Did the lady really need a history lesson? Sir, I strongly suggest you return to your table, and finish your breakfast. Or what? You don't want to know. So, we're measurin' dicks, is that it? From what I understand... this about sums you people up. Actually... this seems more accurate. Okay, that's enough. What? You're gonna bust out some chop-socky? Son. Here. For the food and the mess. I've never seen such rude people in my life. Us either. Now, if you can sit right there... It had 15.1 per cent... ...uh, 15.5 per cent... ...magnesium, and of course, most of this iron is actually down in the core of the Earth. If you could actually get down and sample the core, uh, it'll be 88 per cent iron. 40 per cent... No, sorry, 47% of the Earth's crust, it consists of oxygen. Now, 70% of the Earth's surface is covered in water. Right? Uh... When astronauts first went into space, uh, they looked back at the Earth with human eyes for the first time, and they called it... Just a few more questions. Not until you tell me what this is. The future of the planet. If you're selected... you'll carry my legacy forward. As I did my father's, as he did his, and so forth. My son was a disappointment. So I've been forced to consider outsiders. You. I don't want it. I don't want to give it up... but I must. Before it's too late. Becoming one with what we love is the price we pay. I am dying. The Earth is struggling... but... with this power... you could return the world back to Eden. When I fall, you will take up the mantle. You will restore my good name. You're crazy. This is not how you save the world. The pace of nature is everlasting. Agree or disagree? - I don't know. - Agree or disagree? I can't help you. I wanna go home. Let me leave, please. Let me leave right now! Quiet! Sit. Sit! Now... is the pace of nature everlasting? Uh... No. Half-truths are not acceptable. - I need a definitive answer. - Yes. Yeah. Hmm. Well, thank you. There'll be no more questions. You're free to go. I won't tell anyone. I know. Is that the target? This is the perimeter. If we step across this line, he'll feel us coming. How do you know that? I'm the Wu Assassin, and I had a good teacher. Now, Wu Assassin, if he can feel us coming, how're we gonna get him? We have to be careful. Okay. I'll follow your lead. I've always wondered... why me? You took me in, raised me. You could've had your own kids. You could have saved somebody else. I was sold to the Triads. Did you know that? My father couldn't pay his gambling debts, so I was shipped to San Francisco. And like you, I... arrived with nothing but my spirit, and a will to... take this world. When I found you in the container... you wouldn't let anyone near your father's body. Do you remember that? You said this one word, uh... yat dien. Yat dien. Over and over. Yat dien. Just a little boy. So fierce. I had to promise to... bury your father, to get you off that ship. Then a week later, my men found you sleeping on his grave. So I, uh... I took you to the neighborhood center. Told them to... find a place for you. Then a week after... they called. They said you kept running away. By that time, I found out that yat dien means... "no father," in Indonesian. So I took you... so you wouldn’t be yat dien any longer. Ayah sayang kamu. Was I wrong about you? All those years? It's late. You should rest. Get the fuck up. I know you need to do this. And it's okay. - It's okay. - Yeah? All my life has been a lie, because of you! What you did. What you took from me. This monster you created. You are not a monster, Lu Xin. Look. Look at it. Fucking look at it! - You see it? - Yeah. 'Cause I do. I look in the mirror... and that's all I see. Just get it over with, then. Do it. Do it. No one's gonna fuckin' miss you. Shit. Oh, shit! Is the pace of nature everlasting? The pace of nature is everlasting. Agree or disagree? Hm? Do you agree? McCullough send you? Keep... Keep the gift away from McCullough. He wants to... He wants... He wants to... reunite with his family. You must stop him.
