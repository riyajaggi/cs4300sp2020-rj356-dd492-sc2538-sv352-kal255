 LADIES NIGHT Hi. I'm taking Rayshawn out of school. - We're going to my mom's. - What? - When? - Today. When and if you figure out your shit, we can talk. - By "shit," you mean my job? - I can't worry about you anymore. I can't wait up for you anymore, praying you walk through the door in one piece. You don't text you. You don't call. You just assume we're in suspended animation when you're not around.

 Well, we aren't. I talk to Ray every day, Pam. You call and help her with her homework for 15 minutes. That's not enough. What do you want me to do? Quit my job? - Come on, baby. You know I love you. - No! It's too late. I'm serious this time. - We're leaving. - Pam! I'll call you when we get to my mom's. Let you know we got there. You're not even gonna let me say goodbye to her? She won't even know the difference. I'm sorry, Frank. Boyd's got your suspect in interrogation. Thanks.

 Good job finding that gun, Riley. Everything okay there? She looked upset. You're one hell of a detective, Inspector. Slow night, Torres? Molasses, Cap. Hi, can you help me with these? Jenny, pick up. Hi. You've reached Jenny Wah. Leave a message. Hey, it's me. - Uh, I think I'm about to get arrested. - Tommy Wah! SFPD! Call a lawyer and come and get me. Yeah, I just... Just come and get me. Come here. Tommy Wah. I'm Captain Fletcher. You know Inspector Boyd. Yeah, we're old buddies. You know, if I were arrested and taken into custody... - I think I'd like to know why I'm here. - You're wasting your time. I don't know anything. About anything. - Hm. - I don't. Hm. What the fuck, man? Why are you showing me those? You knew these guys. Six people, including some of your Triad boys, got shot up at the KTV bar on Pelton. This gun... was used to kill three of the victims. BayRide driver found it in the back of his car. Serial number filed off, but your fingerprints... all on it. Now, you're looking at triple homicide beef, unless... unless you talk to me. I'm thinking we book him on unlawful possession of a firearm. With your background and your priors, man, not a long walk - to get you to murder one. - Why would I kill those guys? - I don't know. - Huh? Six's guys? - Come on. You'd have to have a death wish. - I know. So tell me who did it. - I don't know. - Come on, Tommy. He doesn't know. I... I got that piece off a dead guy. - A dead Russian. - Who I did not kill. You not gonna tell me about that either? Oh, my fucking gosh. How am I gonna explain this shit to you two bozos? - It's so fuckin' stupid... - What? Tommy, you care to share that with the rest of the class? It doesn't matter. - None of this shit matters. - You know what? It matters to the people you killed. Okay? It matters to us. You know, I can see it. It's all over your face, and your body language. You're not a bad guy. Whatever you're afraid to tell me is eatin' you alive. Come on! This is... This is some good stuff, man. Yeah, yeah... The world is about to go up in flames, and... and all you're worried about is some... some gang shit? You don't have a clue. If you know something's happening, you need to tell me. You wouldn't believe me. - I'm more gullible than you may think. - You can't do shit against these guys. They've got superpowers. For real? Superpowers? Like Batman superpowers? Batman doesn't have superpowers. Try Thanos-level shit, dude. I mean, I know that's mixing DC and Marvel, but these... these guys are... are evil motherfuckers, with supernatural powers, like... like fire, and metal, and water. You... You... You can't stop them. They're unstoppable. All he's missing is the tinfoil hat. Maybe. But he's not our killer. Doesn't mean we can't use him. - Cap! - What's up, Johnson? We got some perp in holding wants to see you. Busted her trying to boost a car. Says she knows you. Shit. You're supposed to be a good car thief. Shit happens. What are you doin' here? I couldn't just walk through the front door. You know, we have a way for you to talk to me. You don't have to go get yourself arrested. I had to improvise. I needed to find someplace... safe. What, you're in trouble? Look, it... It's all handled. It's all... taken care of. - For now. - What is? You can talk to me, Christine. I had a crazy couple of days, Frank. Know where I've been today? Downtown. Downtown had some questions about your investigation and your methods. Two hours. Missed lunch with my wife and my kid. You don't wanna know what happened after that. I'm sorry. Christine, stop fuckin' around. I'm not asking you anymore. I'm ordering you, tell me what the hell is goin' on. I need you to trust me on this. Damn it. Frank, wait. Something's not right. No shit, Sherlock. Sit tight. - Gunshot, Captain. - Frank, wait! Open the door! Stay on the door. Put it somewhere safe, till I get back. Don't lose it. Don't touch it. What will happen if I do? You really wanna find out? Sounds like fun, but... - I'll pass. - I'll call you when we're headed back. You got the kids? Yeah, took them to Ghirardelli’s for sundaes. My man. You know they charge a four percent fat tax? Mm-hm. They call it the Healthy San Francisco Surcharge. - Supposed to pay for healthcare. - Mm-hm. You know, like the lottery? - Supposed to pay for school? - Pay... Yeah, right. I'm already paying nine percent sales tax in this city. So, I walk out and I'm paying 13 percent for some hot fudge f... What the fuck? You seein' what I'm seein'? What are we, invisible? Turn around. Aaah, you just ruined my coffee break. Here we go. We got a 10851, Sarge. - In broad daylight? - Mm-hm. Silly me. What's your name? CG Dill. Someone didn't like you. Date of birth. Eight, 19-none of your fuckin' business. Hey. You be nice. Eight-24-1983. See? That wasn't so hard. Huh. Bit frisky, this one. Picked her up in the act. You'd think she would have seen our Cruiser, but... sure enough, she decides to jack her a ride right there. I mean, she could've run when she saw us. - Mm-hm. - Didn't. Easiest collar ever. I'm thinkin' we should run a 5150 for her, Sarge. Okay. Sign this to confirm contents. You need this to get your bag back, when they haul your ass off to County. 5150. Maybe I am crazy. Whatever. I need to talk to your captain. He's a bit busy right now. - Tell him CG Dill is here. - And watch him do what? Run. To wherever I am. Look, Christine, stop fuckin' around. I'm not asking you anymore. I'm ordering you, tell me what the hell is goin' on. I need you to trust me on this. Damn it. Frank, wait! Something's not right. No shit, Sherlock. Sit tight. - Gunshot, Captain. - Frank, wait! Open the door! I know what this is! Someone's after it! - God damn it! - Come on! Move! Hey, Mom, Dad. So, uh, we had a pipe break in the dining room last night. And... And I'm gonna have to close for a few days while we get it cleaned. You know, in case if you... read anything online. There's water leaks and... I gotta go. I love you. Bye. Mr. Young. I brought you some seasonal herbs and vegetables you could put on your menu. Thank you. But I get produce delivered twice a week. Ah, old habits. I used to deliver to your parents. Is everything okay? Yeah. Yeah, we... we hosted an event last night, and I'm just cleaning up. Oh. Was Kai at the event? Why? Did he seem okay? - Yeah, he seemed fine. - I'm worried about him. Something's goin' on. And that would be what? Oh, it's probably nothing. You know where he is? Yeah, he, um... he's on a road trip with Uncle Six. Road trip. Yeah. They're working some things out. - Father-son stuff. - Mm. Should be back by tomorrow. Ah, I see. Okay. You know, I can help you. With what? Whatever's going on with Kai. Clearly, you're involved. Goodbye, Mr. Young. I'll let you know. Okay. Hey, it's me. Uh, I think I'm about to get arrested. Yo, we got a tire print... Tommy Wah. All right, have a seat. I'll inform the arresting officers. They'll let you know - when they're done with him. - Thanks. I'm going to use the little boys' room. It's in the corner. Yeah. Tommy Wah's lawyer. Hey. Nice to see you. And who are we this time? This is Natalie. What do you think, Woody? You look bonny. Take a seat. You'd be a fun vessel. I got a job for you. Uncle Six is no longer in possession of the Fire Wu Xing. The Wu Assassin. He gave it to some undercover cop for safekeeping. I need you to find it. The cop's name is CG Dill. You want her dead or alive? I want the Wu Xing. Her... I don't care about. I'll let you know when I find her. Soon as you can. She's nothing special. Oh, trust me. He is all that... and so much more. So, what's up with the decaf Americano? - Puts a little jump in my step. - Oh, yeah? Also keepin' it slim and trim. Watchin' the waistline. - Sure. - Nice shoes. Inspector. Hi. Latte, seven pumps of chai, no water, almond milk. - Inspector Riley, your usual. - Thanks, Maryn. See you tomorrow. Bye. Maryn, Maryn... Excuse me. Inspector Riley? Yes. Can I help you? Well, can I... I need to talk to you. In private. My office okay? Yes, thank you. This way. Yeah... Hey, can you check one more time? As far as you can see. Okay... Hey, Alice. Just got a call from a CI in Chinatown. He says he's got eyes on Tommy Wah. You really need me for this? - I'm, uh... feeling a little off today. - What? You're... You're right. What was I thinking? Let's go. Whoa, whoa. Riley. We do this by the book or Fletcher'll have our asses. All right, let's go. Tommy Wah! SFPD! Hands in the air! Hey. Tell Fletcher I'll stash him in interrogation. Sounds good. Thanks. All right. Not right there. I think he's right. Yeah? Boyd's got your suspect in interrogation. Thanks. Hey, good job finding that gun, Riley. Stop! Let's go! Stay down! Don't move! CG! Fletcher sent me. Jesus. We have to get my bag out of the property room. Bag? This place is a wild West. We're under attack here. And that bag is the reason. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Easy. Easy. Easy. Easy. Easy. Here we go. Leave him, Christine. We gotta go. Now! Let's go. Fuck it. Hey, man! Uh, get out! Go down! Come on. Tommy Wah. Isn't it? No! No, fuck it! No! We gotta get in there. The Wu Xing’s in there. Yeah. Alice! Come on. Come on, come on. Come on. Let's get you on your feet, Riley. Come on. Slow, slow. Easy, easy. Come on. Don't touch it. Jenny? Come out. Please. - He wants to talk to you. - Tommy. I believe you have something I want. You think I'm stupid enough to bring it here? I think you're smart enough to. Bag. Please. Let him go. Give me the Wu Xing. Tommy, let's go. Uh-uh. Zan. Wait. There it is. That's what you were wanting, Zan. Take it. I will say this... because this is something to mention. It is so nice that I can still be surprised by a wee little something. Let my brother go. Oh. I remember that feeling. A sudden surge of power. But until you learn to control it... you're just a child behind the wheel. My dear. And accidents do happen. Frank? Not any more, sweetie. And two Wu against one? I don't like your odds. - Tommy! - One more outburst out of you, and I will gut him like a sow on Auld Handsel's Monday. Zan. Come. Now... Now, I can let... your dear, sweet brother die... or you can choose to save him. Entirely up to you. Gideon... while she's weighing up her options... the Wu Assassin entrusted the Wu Xing... with this one. - That means she's valuable to me. - Wait. Take her. Really? Look at this. - You want me to trade this for that? - For Christ's sakes. Just do it. What the hell? What just happened? What's it gonna be, Miss Wah? Life... or death?
