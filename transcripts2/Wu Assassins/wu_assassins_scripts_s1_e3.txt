 Danny Lo. Weihan Ng. Uncle Six’s entire counterfeiting operation. IDs on the girls? Most likely trafficked in from Fujian. These animals will just have them replaced in the next shipment. Fucking hell. We got a witness. But he's not talking. Doesn't speak English, and when I ask him in Canto, he seems not to speak Chinese, either. Look at this shit. I said there wasn't gonna be a gang war. God damn it. Hands.

This morning. Ho Yuen. We could sell these at Master Wah's. Charge a big markup. How many times are we gonna go through this, Tommy? You wouldn't go to the support group. You dropped out of the outpatient program, you stopped seeing your sponsor. - How many times, Tommy? - I... You know, I... I messed up, okay? But I'm fine now. - It's all good. - Tommy. If you keep going like this, you're going to die. That was the last time. I'm done. What? Seriously. I don't ever wanna feel this shitty again... Don’t bullshit me, Tommy! I'm not! Do you know what happened last night? Somebody shot up a KTV parlor. Six people died. That could have been you. Come on, Jenny, why would I go to a KTV parlor, huh? I can’t sing. We need to check you in somewhere. Get you some help. Some real help. Cool, okay. I'll look into it. Mom and Dad are here tomorrow. Remember that? Try to keep it together until they leave, please. We don't need them to know about this. Buns are in the fridge. I am going to the TCM doctor later. I'll pick you up some herbs. Jen... Nobody gets out of the Triad. And a little sister shouldn't have to take care of her goh goh like this. I'm sorry. ♪ Doubtless ♪ ♪ Why does it feel like We're just in sin now? ♪ ♪ Why don't we bring me down Something bigger ♪ Bigger pieces. - We want them waddling out. - Okay. Yeah. Hey, stranger. Hey, Jenny. You forgot to drain the fat. Fat's the best part. Maybe in the '90s. Crazy boy. - You got a sec? - Yeah. I'll finish up. - Thank you. - Crazy man. You taken on any business partners lately? What? New manager? Investor? Someone older? Not Chinese. Why, you been spying on me? There's some stuff going on. That's all. You know... I'm worried. Is this about what happened the other night? With you and Tommy? That job offer still open? Are you gonna answer my question? My truck’s dead, Jenny. I need a job. You're not telling me something. - I’m being mysterious. - No, you're not. You’re being weird. What is it that you’re not telling me? Six offered to set me up in a new restaurant. When? - A few days ago. - And? I said no. Like I should have the first time. I'm sorry... for what I put you through. Is that it? Is that why you've been acting all squirrelly? Yeah. Okay... you're hired. I'll get Jimmy to get you the menu. It's all right. I remember it. It's been a long time. Try me. I... I mean... if you can keep up. Okay. Um... Laziji. Fire chicken. I'm ready. Pass me the wine. ♪ Hey, lion, you're not ♪ ♪ Hey, lion, you're not my king ♪ ♪ And I don't want your worship ♪ ♪ I'm already tall ♪ ♪ Hey, lion, you keep your gifts ♪ ♪ I've got many of them ♪ ♪ And I'm already full ♪ ♪ Hey, lion, please save your breath ♪ ♪ You've already spoken And I've heard it before ♪ Excuse me, Chef. ♪ Hey, lion, here comes our death ♪ ♪ It's time to silence your sermon ♪ ♪ And to go back to war ♪ How is it? Not bad. ♪ Hey, lion, you're not ♪ ♪ Lion king ♪ - Thanks, Jimmy. - Yep. ♪ Hey, lion, you're not ♪ ♪ Lion king ♪ I took a loan from Six. That's how I paid for the remodel. I should have told you. Do your parents know? I did what I said I'd never do, when Six offered to bankroll our restaurant, and... here I am. Things change. You haven't forgiven me. And don't pretend like you have. It's... been a thing between us, and... after all these years, I still feel like I'm trapped in that building. - He saved us. - And now he owns us. I didn't realize how much, until these last few days. Maybe I can change that. You can't go up against Uncle Six, Kai. No one can. I got your text. Pam and I are fighting. Slept on the couch last night. I had to sneak out this morning without my coffee, so... got this shit. See, that's why I live alone. You should try it sometime. House about to float away. Only friend Bruce the goldfish? No, thank you. So what's up? You wanna tell me what the hell happened last night? Pfft. It was nothing. Some creep. Perks of living on the docks. A freak occurrence, huh? I'm a big girl living in a big city, Cap. There are perverts everywhere. This has nothing to do with the case, if that's what you're thinking. Thinkin' of pullin' you. I told you, this has nothing to do with the case. McCullough iced six people at a karaoke bar last night. Uncle Six is gonna retaliate. I don’t wanna add a dead cop to that body count. You brought me in to close this case. I am close. One week. They'll be in bracelets. You smell anything wrong, even a whiff, you get out. It’s all roses, Cap. We've looked everywhere. Nobody's seen the bald chef. It would be impudent to introduce oneself so boldly to Chinatown without desiring my attention. He's here. Thousand apologies, dai lo. But the chef only hurt Chen and Lau. The Scotsman killed our brothers. Shouldn’t our energies be on him? Of course. My apologies, brother. A single spear and a single horse. I will tend to the Scotsman when I see fit, personally. But this chef... This chef is a threat to me. Which means he's a threat to you... and to Chinatown. If you can't find me this one bald chef... bring all the bald chefs. - Yes, boss. - Yes, boss. - What are you doing? - Shut up, old man. Where are you, Wu Assassin? Mustard greens in the red bin. Bok choi in the blue. Ah. I heard there was some excitement a few nights ago. Eh... Triad think I'm some old man, but they were wrong. Ow. - You all right? - Yeah. Lost two days of business. Tomatoes went bad. Yeah. Do you need help, or anything? What's wrong, Kai? Nothing. Well, nothing means something. Come inside, have some kok fa, huh? I have things to do. You know, an inconvenience is a unrecognized opportunity. Tony Robbins? Mm-mm. - Steve Jobs. - Oh. Oh, no, uh... Wait. Confucius. Young man like you have a long life ahead of you. Go appreciate it. Now, me... okay, it could be over in an instant. Especially when Eugene is trying to give me a heart attack! Hey, you ever have any problem with the Triads, you know, or anybody, just come to me. Oh, no. I don't want your death on my conscience, okay? Now, you go enjoy life. Let this old man take care of those assholes, huh? - All right. - Mm-hm. It was open. That would be a bad idea in this building. I need to talk to you. I'm busy. There have been complications. New ones, and ones very old. Someone, a rival, is after me. It's the life you have chosen. You misunderstand. I have no quarrel with the consequence of my vocation. It's... It's you I'm worried about. Considering our... association... I'm concerned this rival, or his people, might get to you. Use you to get to me. And I can't allow that. Don't worry about me. This is your opportunity, Wu Assassin. When the time is right, do not hesitate. When did things go wrong between us, Kai? What happened? I saw you for who you are. And realized what I didn't want to be. And what's that? A monster... pretending to be a man. This is for you. - If anything happens to me... - Keep it. One day, you might see the world for the mass of gray it is. Maybe then, you won't judge me with such harshness. There are no true heroes or villains. We are but two sides of the same coin. Business owner and Triad alike pray to Guan Gong. This is a Mizuyaki Honyaki. Ten times... more expensive than your other knives. Why haven't you used it? Because... you gave it to me. Yet you didn't throw it away. Strike. - Strike! - I heard you! Strike! Actions have consequences, Kai. And so do inactions. That was your opportunity to kill the Fire Wu, and you missed it. What are you doing? Hey, hey, who are you? What are you doing? - What happened? - The Triad. They took Eugene. Why? They said I was protecting him. And that he was beating up the Triad. I told them he didn't do it, but they wouldn't listen. They're rounding up men! Wait. Wait. My sister. If you lay a hand on her, I'll fucking... You swear too much. Fuck. Fuck! What? - They took Eugene from Mr. Young. - So? Get out of this, Tommy. If you’re involved in this, just get out of it. Re... Really? You start some peanut shit in my restaurant, Chen and Lau go missing, Six goes on the warpath, and suddenly you're all up in my grill? Like, what the fuck, Kai? No. Please. I didn't do anything. What are you doing? Zan! Let him go.

Free drinks for life. ♪ Oh, but I say safety first ♪ ♪ Please don't let 'em take from me ♪ You're from the church? Hm. Oh. St. Peter's across the street. They send people in here time to time, to try to save our souls. - Is it working? - Oh, yeah. Yeah. You on the job? - Inspector Christine Gavin. - Yeah. Bayview. Ah, you're a little out of your jurisdiction, Inspector. Well, how can I help you? I wanted to ask you a few questions about your time in Chinatown. Well, that was a long time ago, and my memory... ain't what it used to be. Tell me about the Hwa Song fire. - How did you find me? - News reports. I checked with the precinct, and they said you hang out here. Yeah, well. What happened that night? - What did you see? - Nothin'. Come on, Jack. There's a war in Chinatown. I'm working on something. Come on, Jack. You've got a story. I can tell. Tell me... and I'll tell you one. Well, it ain’t pretty. Most aren't. I was off that night. I should have minded my own fucking business. Sure, yeah, okay, I... I liked to have a few drinks now and then, take the edge off, loosen up. But I was a good cop. And when you're a good cop, and you hear a 904B, don't matter if you had a few drinks or not, you go and help. When I got there, that fire was already ragin'. I mean, that heat was somethin' else. You could feel it from across the street. The... The arson inspector said that that fire was so hot, it melted the bricks. You believe that shit? Melted the bricks. But there was somethin'... wrong, somethin' different. What? You know, I've seen a lot of arsons before. Up close. In a fire, it starts in one room, and then it spreads to the next room, and it goes to the next room, like that. Boom, boom, boom, like that. But this one, it was different. There was something all wrong. It was different. It... It moved like a snake. It ate up that buildin' like that. I mean, Jesus Christ, I thought it was gonna burn down all of Chinatown. Maybe even San Francisco, but it didn't. It just stayed there in the Tong. And that's when I heard 'em. The kids... screamin'. I wanted to help, but I just... There’s nothing in the file or the news reports about dead kids. That’s because they didn’t die. The way that fire was burnin', they should have. But they were saved by the monster. What do you mean... "monster"? The fire monster. I saw it. I saw it separate the flames... and control it. That's how those kids got out. They all got out, except for one. He was... He was pretty fucked up, and I wanted to help, but somethin' like that, that can control fire, what the hell would it have done to me? So I just... I froze. I just... I... Is this the monster you saw? I can't see that. I don’t have my glasses. No. Uncle Six started the fire, didn’t he? - You had to have seen him there. - No. Did he threaten you? Pay you? The monster was real. Hi, it's Kai. Leave a message. Hey, it's me. We need to talk. Call me. Hoods off. Where are we? Eyes ahead, old man. You were at Master Wah's that night. Let him go. You want me. Well... All this trouble you caused. You could have just come to say hello. Take them back. You, too. Do you know who I am? You're the man... I have to kill.
