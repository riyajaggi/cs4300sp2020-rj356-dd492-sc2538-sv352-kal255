 - Hm. - Anything interesting? Paid one point five million for it at auction. A guidepost to the afterlife. Three thousand years old. So they say. Hm. One point five million. I underpaid. Doesn't matter. Show me. To the victor.

 Perfect way to spend... thirteen hours. Well, it's part of a set. - What is? - Your guidepost. The relic. I would imagine the trip to the afterlife would have a few twists and turns. Well, you'll have to let me know. Goodbye, Miss Jones. After me, the flood. You're late. You're still waiting. Enjoy the trappings while you can. You won't have them long. The Triad follows me now. As long as you're a servant to McCullough.

 Your day is done. The slightest taste of power, and you believe yourself untouchable. There are still those loyal to me. Let's get to it. What does McCullough want? A negotiation. Kai's friends have been corrupted. He has no leverage in this equation. Jenny Wah is the Fire Wu. Her brother, Tommy, is close to death. And the cop has been taken by the Metal Wu. If he wants to see his friends again... Kai will do exactly what McCullough says. You made your choice... and you'll suffer for it. Spoken like someone with no vision whatsoever. The next time I see you... I'll kill you. Look, we can't change what happened while we were gone. We have to deal with what is happening right now. Why are we still discussing? It seems clear to me. We give him what he wants. He takes the Earth thing, and does whatever the fuck he's gonna do with it, - and we get our friends back. - I told you, that will not happen. - Why? - We'll be dead. Kai must not acquiesce. What's your idea, then? - We hold. - Hold? He has all the cards! - Not the one he needs to end the world. - Kai... I know I'm new to all this supernatural shit, but I know how to negotiate. Okay? What you need is a position. You don't have one. Killing McCullough is tomorrow's problem. You get that, right? I know you, and if we don't do everything we can to save our friends right now, you are never going to forgive yourself. This is Alec McCullough. Do I have the pleasure of speaking with the Wu Assassin? Yes. And do you understand the situation? Yes. Good. I have what you want, and you have what I need. - Yes. - So you bring me the Earth Wu, and everyone can go home to the bosom of their loving family. Yes? The Earth Wu is dead. Then bring me the Wu Xing. No. - No. - Come on. No? "No" will not save your friends. I suggest that you rethink your... That's it? What the fuck? Who are you? A servant of the Dao. Like you. I've seen your face... - on mine. - Indeed. I'm one of the Thousand Monks who protect you. Guess you could say... we are the Wu Assassin. Where's Ying Ying? Ying Ying is in your past. As she told you she would be. You face the future now. The Wood Wu seeks to control the world. No. He wants to reunite with his family. This is what I've been told. Is it possible? He would have to get here first. But that's impossible. As you know... only the Chosen One can reach this place. What if he got here? The gate. It's the only link between your time and this place. And this place is the only possible link between Alec and his past. If he were to make his way here, his presence would disrupt the flow of the Dao. Time, space, reality. All flow through the Dao, like a river. - The repercussions would be... - Bad. Catastrophic. Every moment Alec is out of time, the Dao is further corrupted, the universe further out of balance. You must stop him, Kai. How do I do that? There's only one way. - Kill him. - What are you doing, dude? - That was negotiating. - Negotiating? - He just killed our friends... - I have to stop McCullough! Good. What do you need? An army. Get your Triad back. Let's go. Hey. We need to talk. - I'm the Wu Assassin. Not you. - What the fuck does that mean? - So what? - This all falls on me. I may not understand any of this, I may not even agree with the way you're doing it, but I'm here. Doesn't mean I won't call you on your bullshit. And just so you know, I don't trust Uncle Six. At all. Thank you. For what? Not killing him. He deserved it. After what he did to us. Maybe. But I'm still glad you didn't do it. If I may have a word? Ouch! Oh! There's nothing like a good burn to stimulate growth. You might want to hear this. I have what you want, and you have what I need. So you bring me the Earth Wu, and everyone can go home to the bosom of their loving family. The Earth Wu is dead. Oh, this is the good part. Then bring me the Wu Xing. No. No? "No" will not save your friends. So I suggest that you rethink your deci... Well... apparently, he's willing to sacrifice you for his noble quest, given him by a thousand monks, dead for millennia. This is bigger than me. Kai knows that. - I'm surprised you don't. - No. You see, you represent everything that he is trying to save. Only by thinking small can he achieve the monumental. And I'm sure, ultimately, he'll come to the same conclusion... in time. But, unfortunately, time is not our friend right now. Says the man who enjoys immortality? Miss Wah. I need you... to convince Mr. Jin to give me the Earth Wu Xing. You don't know him like I do. So you're prepared to sacrifice your dear, sweet brother? For this fool's quest? Because... I will kill him, Jenny. What you're asking me to do is impossible. Ah, I see. There comes a time... when words lose all meaning. That word for me is, uh... "impossible". I witnessed it. Watching this world fuck along for hundreds of years. Impossible to me, it just means inevitable. Crossing of the oceans. Conquering continents, curing disease. Leaving this Earth to walk on other planets. Everything man believes impossible today... it's just inevitable. Biding its time. On its way. I know you're capable of reasonable, rational thought. And you know as well as I, that if Mr. Jin doesn't get me what I want now, I'll simply take it later. The only difference being... is the depth of blood that I walk through to get it. I'll leave you with that. Success? A lot of trouble for an expensive paperweight. Yeah, you've done well. I never do otherwise. You promised me a Wu Assassin. Aye. There's no greater fraud than a promise not kept. I hope you don't mind if I kill him, then. Careful. He took out Baxter. Where's Gideon? Oh... Gideon. He's a... peripatetic one. I think you'll like his new host. Who has he gotten into now? Someone useful. I can't wait to meet him. Her... you mean. The fuck? I wouldn't move, if I were you. No. Hold on. Please. Screaming won't help. Fuck you. I'm not talking to you. You need to stop that. It's annoying. What? What's happening? You know, you really need to stop that. It's annoying. Who are you? I'm the Metal Wu. Or Gideon, if you prefer. - Where the fuck am I? - Oh, well. That is a question. This is a mind cabinet. It appears to you as something you're familiar with. Except here, there is no way out. Until I let you out. I've taken over all the metal in your body. Calcium, iron, copper, zinc. Ergo, I've taken over you. You're mine to move, shake, salsa if I want to. Get out. If I had a nickel. Get out of my body. Okay. La-di-da! Get the fuck out of my body, you piece of motherfucking shit! You know, I've heard it all. And that rates pretty low. Really? Just relax. I'll be out of here before you even know it. Wait. You should have paid more attention in chemistry class. And why is that? Hemoglobin. One of my favorite things. It contains 70% of iron in the human body. Hm, and? And... if what you're saying is true... you need that to control me. Mmm. And? I'm anemic. Always have been. CG? - You know what's going on? - Yes. The Metal Wu is in me. I'm fighting it, but it's a bitch. - Please tell me you get this thing out. - I can. Where are you? Some abandoned timber mill. West Oakland. Get here quick. Alec's about to move us. Tommy? Uh... - Alive. - Sh! If we can get him to the hospital, he might even stay that way. It's okay. I gotta go. Someone's coming. - Shit. - Hold tight. I missed you. I... I've missed you. Come on. Alec wants us. For what? Are we all here? We're all here. You were always ambitious. - You turned your back on us. - There are larger things at stake than these dogs who don't know their place. And a lonely orphan girl who doesn't know hers. I would have done anything for you. I told you what would happen when I see you again. Do you doubt me still? Many have tried. I'm still here. But if that's what youwant, I'll give you your chance. Shall we get started? Yes. Let's get started. Come on. Yep. You find 'em, text me. - And watch your back. - Let's go. - You find 'em? - No. - You? - No. Shit! - Hey. - Hey. What? I told you not to touch the Wu Xing. If I didn't, Alec would have gotten to it. If you want to relitigate it, that's fine. But we're here now, and that's that. Yeah, we're here. But he's not. Why? Because that's what he wanted. Look, he wants you to meet him. Tomorrow morning. Here. If you don't show up, he'll kill Tommy. And if I don't go back now... he'll kill Tommy. It's over, Kai. You can't win. I'll win. We'll win. Alec is powerful. He knows every move you're going to make, before you even make them. CG's on our side. Does Alec know that? We're gonna need a plan. It's me, Jenny. And I'm with you. I've got control of this thing. I know. Kai told me. So, what's the plan? Don't tell him. Don't you dare tell him. Jenny. Jenny. Jenny, listen to me. Jenny! Jenny! - You can scream all you want. - Jenny! - But no one's gonna be able to hear you. - Jenny! Tommy... - Hey. - Hey. - Jen. - Hey, come here. Every time I feel myself slipping... Alec comes and heals me... just enough. Fuck that guy. I did it again, Jen. With that gun. No. This is all my fault. - No, it's not. - Yeah. I never... I never should have been at that police station. You never would have been if I... If I... Listen, I'm gonna tell you something. Ever since I remember, I blamed you... for everything. For not getting in with the right people. For not taking care of yourself. For not being more like Kai or Lu Xin. More like how I thought you should be. As if who you wanted to be didn't matter. I never listened to you. I'm sorry. No, no, no, it's... It's on me. I don't blame you. You know, when this is over... Yeah, when do you think it's gonna be over? No. When this is over... things are gonna be different, okay? Ow. Shit! I knew we couldn't trust him. Son of a bitch. He set us up! He went back to the Triad, Kai. - You don't know that. - I know it. Watch.
