 - Kai? - Lu Xin, please, just... - Listen... - Why? Kai can't do shit about this. This is a fucking mess. - What is wrong with you? - Just listen to me. I am going to tell you something, and I need you to hear me. I'm a cop. What? - I am after McCullough, not you. - What the fuck is goin' on? I swear to God. I will explain everything. No, no. No. Fuck! Don't fuckin' move! Stay where you are, and don't fucking move. We need to call Kai...

 right now. Kai, what's wrong? Have you seen this man? It's important. No, I... I don't think so. Why? CG? Your... Your prophecy came true. Where are you? Lee's Wheels. All right. I'm on my way. I need you to come with me. During prime rush? Are you crazy? Is everything okay? I need you to come with me. Both of you. Now. Chinatown belongs to me. There's nothing for you there, but a spectacular end to your life. You'll be leaving... today. Oh... I know you Chinese like your liquor. Just like the Scots. You and I... we have a lot in common. I'd like to offer you an alternative... - to your problem. - You are my problem. I have to admit... that does make me a wee bit gleeful. Tell me somethin'. Why do you care so much for Chinatown? - Why do you? - Well... It's not even a town, is it? It's just some slum on prime real estate in San Francisco. Whereas the world... Well, in a word... it's everything. I'll leave the world to you. Chinatown is mine. Yeah, well... Like the Mad King... I'm contrary. So I think I'm going to stay. That's, uh... quite the parlor trick you have there, mate. But that... won't get you out of here alive. Just sayin'. Like I say... you and me... we have a lot in common. Who are you? Seeing as I know you are who I thought you were... maybe it's worth telling. If you've got a few minutes. I'm all ears. Well, then. Since you're asking... I'll start at the beginning. I've been looking for you, Alasdair. How do you know my name? You can fight. Good. Take it. Devil take ye, witch! Don't be afraid. It's a force of good, not evil. It'll help you defeat the Wu. I will strike you down where you stand. You have been chosen. By who? The Dao. I know no one by the name of Dao. Get your demon trinket away from me. Be gone with you! This is the Monk Piece. It will make you stronger. Aye, or kill me, more like. If you die, it will be by the hand of a Wu Warlord, not this. Only after your death will it leave you. If my death rids me of you, I'll happily welcome it. Accept your calling, or everyone you love will die. My... My mercenary days are over. I want no part of your war. War is coming. You have a family now. This... will protect them and others. You are the Wu Assassin, Alasdair. You've been chosen. Take it. Take it. Don't be afraid. I'm not afraid. But this Monk Piece, it gives you power? And Uncle Six has some other kind of power? He's the Fire Wu. Yes. Kai, seriously? We've got three dead guys here. This shit right here is real. He's telling the truth. I saw it with my own eyes. Trust me. Trust you? We don't even know you. And just for the record, I've seen this "Wu Assassin" with my own eyes. It ain't him. It's some old bald dude. I told you. The faces protect me. Okay, come on, man. I'm not that high. Holy fuck! Whoa, okay. Shit. Stop doing that. Look... Everything he said is true. We're all in this. Whatever this is... it's playing out. We have to figure out what we're gonna do, how we're gonna help Kai... and how we're gonna survive this. - We have three dead people on the floor. - I know. Get it together. - Next time, it could be you. - Get it together? I don't know how you did that with your face, but what you're saying is... it's not possible. You sound crazy. And... And this is not how the world works, right? People with... magic powers? I don't know what just happened or why you're backing him up, but... I don't believe it. I'm sorry. - It doesn't matter. - I believe it. Shit, I... I... I've seen it. I believe it. - What shit have you seen? - Did you not just... - I've seen some shit, Jenny. - God! I got blood on me. I had a dream, Maggie. And I saw her. And I saw you and Liam. You were drowning. A dream is what's got you running us through the night woods? We're safe here. Far frae the sea... and safe frae her. And who is this "her"? You know the water spirit? Kelpie? - Shape-shifter? - Aye, well enough. It's not a story. She exists. Oh, she exists, does she? Is that right? She exists. And she knows who I am. And she knows what I can do. Are you trying to make me jealous? No, I've got the ring, and the ring says you're mine. Aye, if she can find me... then she can find you. I'm not gonna let that happen. I'm not scared of a kelpie, Da. Of course you're not, laddie... 'cause you're a McCullough. Brave, like the boar. But the rest of you, aye? Sh. Well, we all know it's impossible to kill a kelpie. So if what you say is true, Alec... I guess we'll be runnin' forever, will we? I've been given mystical powers. Oh, Alec. Stop now, love. Maggie, please. I've been given mystical powers, so I can defeat her. But I can't do that till I know you're both safe. I fear you're coming down with a sickness, love. Have I ever lied to you? I'll have your tongue should you try. You best believe me now. Da, I'm hungry. When can... Liam! - Liam! - Run away! - No! Liam! - Maggie, it's the kelpie! Take him! Water Wu. Get away from him, you kelpie bitch! "Saving the world... has a cost," she said. "Not everyone you love will survive. But you must." And I have. And I have. We're gonna be okay. I didn't start that fire. Isn't that crazy? This whole time I thought it was my fault, that I was responsible for Lu Xin getting burned, and... now... Shit's crazy. You have every right to be mad. Actually, I'm not. I'm more relieved. Is that weird? No. It's the least weird thing I've heard tonight. Is this really happening? What Kai's talking about? If it is... - then we'll get him through it. - And if it isn't? We'll get him through it. Did you know about Uncle Sixbefore this? No. Aah. All this time, I thought he saved us. I thought he was a hero. He paid for my surgeries. Did you know that? No. He looked out for us. For me. Makes sense. He started the fire. We should be dead. I mean, imagine the guilt. You are right about one thing. He has to die. Uncle Six has to die. - I'll take care of it. - Bullshit. I know you. You're not gonna be able to do it. - I have to. - Then I'll help you. - No. - Then give me the power. - I'll kill Six. I'll do it all. - It doesn't work that way. How do you know? You don't know shit about this power, do you? Look. The guy you're working for? McCullough? He's part of this. I think he's going to kill Jenny. Jenny? Why? I don't know yet. It's not clear. - And you want me to look out for her. - I want you to look out for yourself. I think the only way McCullough can get to her is through you. What about CG? She's a fuckin' cop. She's gonna cover her own ass. You know that, right? I trust her. Well, I don't. Then trust me. The bodies aren't gonna move themselves. BMW X5. Parked out front. Bring it around. Why? Gotta put the bodies in it. Oh, of course. And then what? We get rid of the car. How? I know a guy. Yeah. Okay. All right. I'll go do that. What are you gonna do? Take you home. You best tell me this is one of your tricks. That my family are still alive. Death is part of the Wu Assassin's life. I've told you this. Bring them back. I can't. That's the cost of saving the world. You have magical powers. You can bring them back. No one has the power of resurrection. Then send me to them. Let me be with them. Channel your pain, Alasdair. You need all your strength to defeat the Wood Wu. His healing powers makes it difficult to kill. You must finish this, Alasdair. You can finish this. Aye. I'll finish this. And when I'm done... I'll come back and finish you. Why you? Thanks. I mean, the Dao could have picked anyone. A Navy SEAL, a cop, Lu Xin. You. Exactly. Maybe you should go to Hong Kong with your parents until this is over. Maybe you should think again. You didn't tell Tommy or Lu Xin to run away to Hong Kong. They're not you. You ever see me run away from a fight? I stayed here to run my parents' restaurant. I stayed to take care of Tommy. I stayed to... We fight together. This is different. Didn't you just say the Dao should have picked me? Well, it did. It picked all of us when it chose you. We're supposed to fight this together somehow. I know it. And you need help. You've always needed help. You're right. I have to kill the Fire Wu. You mean Uncle Six. He's not Uncle Six anymore. Well, then you better have a plan. He doesn't know I'm the Wu Assassin. That's not a plan. It's all I've got. You can't just go and kill the head of the Triad. He's... He's got soldiers. And... And Zan. And he's Uncle Six. He's your father. And I've got you. My secret weapon. Yeah, exactly. That's what I've been trying to tell you. Took you long enough. We're gonna figure this out, Kai. You and me. And we're gonna do it tonight. Aryan Bob's in. But it's gonna cost me. And Tommy hit me up. Garage is clean. What the hell am I doing? Cops don't destroy evidence, cover up crimes. We catch bad people. Like me? Yeah. Like you. You know, maybe I'm not the bad guy you think I am. When I was a kid, all I ever wanted to do was earn my family's respect. Be my own boss, make a name for myself. So you became a car thief? Things changed... after the fire. Everybody kept pretending they couldn't see the scars, so... I pretended, too. But I still felt like a monster. Do you know why I like undercover work? Because when I'm pretending to be someone else... I don't have to be me. I gotta tell you somethin'. When I pulled that trigger today... it felt good. How sick is that? I don't think it matters anymore. What's your real name? Christine. Christine Gavin. It's nice to meet you... Christine. She said killing the Wood Wu would be difficult. That its healing powers would make it so. She was right. But I had a secret weapon. The desire to bring my family back to me. That was my plan. That is what drove me from break of day to nightfall. Day in and day out. It fueled my battles against the Wu. That singular, fleeting desire. Please hear my prayer. Give me back my love. Give me back my life. Let the sun shine again... on their souls. On their souls. I learned many times over, in the many years since I myself became the Wood Wu... that no amount of desire, no depth of love, sacrifice, nor grief, can breathe life back into a corpse. There is no returning from death. Only from near-death. That has been the abiding lesson I've had to endure over and over, these past 500 years. Bring them back! Bring them back! No one can live 500 years. And yet... here I be. Does that mean I'm... - immortal too? - No. That's the providence of the Wood Wu alone. The power to heal. Like you, I can bring death... and other miseries. But the fly in our ointment is the Wu Assassin. Though he wouldn't be if you... held on to your Monk Piece. Aye. I gave it up, in hopes of resurrecting my beloveds. And the curse... of that miscalculation... has left me with an even longer life without them. So... we make do. The Wu Assassin is here, you know. In San Francisco. I can feel him. And that makes us vulnerable. So that's what this is about. Killing the Wu Assassin. You think too small, friend. You're consumed by ruling Chinatown, when you could rule China. Your fire power... is magnificent. But it's not enough to stop him. Join me. Join the others. - Others? - There are five. The Assassin? But one. I challenge you... to imagine yourself as one of the rulers of another world, outside the borders of your precious Chinatown. Join me. Kai? What time is it? I need your help. Toilet or stove? - I'll get my tools. - Neither. Can't groceries wait till I open tomorrow? I need them now. Okay, I'll get my keys. Raw bitter almonds? Aconite? Potassium chloride? Yeah. Poison makes it easy for a man to kill. But not easy for a man to die. Look into a man's eye and watch him die, you don't forget that. When I was in Vietnam... I was stationed at the Ia Drang Valley. It was the most terrible, beautiful place I ever saw. To this day. You know, we had this kid in my squad. He was from Cedartown, Georgia. And, boy, he hated K-rations. And he would say... "It's not the VC that killed us. It's the food." So one day, this kid... bought some soup from an old woman in a nearby village. Yeah, the soup smelled good like that. We were all so jealous, watching him slurp it down. But that night... we weren't so jealous watching him puke his guts out. Hundred degrees outside. There he was. Cold sweat. Trembling. Talking crazy. He died in my arms. I watched the light leave his eyes. I don't know what you're doing, Kai, but I strongly suggest you don't do it. I'm doing what I have to, Mr. Young. I'm an... accessory now. I know. I'm sorry. It's time for you to find another grocer. Call Zan. You don't call Zan. Tell her she owes Jenny Wah a rematch. Come in. I brought you something to eat. In the middle of the night? Winter Melon Soup. Your favorite. A peace offering. You couldn't sleep? A lot on my mind. Oh. You never were a good sleeper. I've been thinking about the restaurant. And your offer. Is it still good? Oh, I thought you said you were a food truck guy? People change, right? People do. But not you. Wu Assassin. If you're gonna kill me, you'll have to do better than this. How did you know? I saw you. At the casino. So, what now? We fight? It is our fate. Unless we choose to change fate. I have much to tell you. The question is... are you prepared to hear it?
