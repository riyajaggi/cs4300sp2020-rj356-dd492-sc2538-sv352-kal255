 Hey, yo, Kai. How much longer are we gonna wait? He just texted me. He's outside. - 'Sup? - 'Sup, Lu? Huh. Where were you last night? You good? Yeah. Just needed to clear my head. Hit the rooms. See some kindred spirits. Hm.

 Got what you asked for. So, where do you want it? All right. Have fun with the bugs, guys. Wait. I still need your help. No. I'm not down with this, uh... black magic business. I'll leave that to you. We were all touched by the Fire Wu that night. It has to be our blood, so this can work. Tommy and Jenny's, too. Really? Dude. Look, it's crazy. But I trust him. An exorcism? J, come on. I'm here, aren't I?

 Guys, my offer still stands. Just pop, to the skull. - Six is dead. We move forward. - I have to try this. If it doesn't work... we'll do it your way. When it doesn't work. Happy? I have much to tell you. The question is... are you prepared to hear it? His name is Alec McCullough. He's a... Well... I thought he was an aggressive business rival. He's a criminal, like me. And like me... he's special. I'm learning to deal with all this new knowledge, just like you. Tell me what McCullough wants. Better question is, what doesn't he want? Because as near as I can tell... he's a monster who wants it all. I look into my own eyes every night... and I see the flames that rage behind them. When I look into the eyes of Alec McCullough... I was scared. He was a Wu Assassin once. So everything you know, he knows. He now holds the Wood Wu, and has for 500 years. You can't go after him alone, Kai. He will kill you. That would be convenient for you. No, it wouldn't. Why can't you... Look... McCullough's already made arrangements with the Metal Wu and the Water Wu. As a loyalty test, I'm to recruit the Earth Wu. Once we're all together, the world as it was yesterday... will no longer be. Here. That's the location of the Earth Wu. Kai... Kai, we have a chance to take a piece off McCullough's chessboard. We can stop him. Me and you? Team up? - To kill the Earth Wu? - Yes. You expect me to trust you? I don't. - You did once. - A long time ago. Before you were the Fire Wu. I... I can't change the past, Kai... or who I am today. I'm just asking you. Please trust me on this. I mean, if I can remove this thing inside of me, I will. But I can't. You know that I can't. Unless you die. Come here. Look at this. This ancient scroll says we are fated to fight to the death. This is what you really want? Do we not have a choice? - Why does he have to die? - He holds the Fire Wu Xing. Death is the only way. That's not what it says on the Monk Piece. The markings on the shell... - Can't be translated. - But can be interpreted. Somehow. Alec can give up the Monk Piece without dying. Why can't Six give up the Fire Wu Xing? Tell me the truth. Is it possible? What you're getting at, it's been attempted before. A long time ago. Once. There is a poison made from the venom of various animals. It's called Gu. If you bless each animal with the blood of someone touched by the power of the Wu, a still living victim... it will enhance the Gu. And Gu, if ingested, will force a struggle within the body of the Wu Xing holder. A struggle for the soul. The culmination of that struggle will cause the Wu Xing to be expelled from the body. The last Wu Assassin who tried this failed, Kai. It cost him his life. And everyone who blessed the animals, and their family, were slaughtered. Are you willing to risk the lives of your best friends? I have to try. I know. Where are you going? Our time together has come to an end. You're on your own path now, Kai. Would you really give up your Wu power? Well, if you're asking me if I will sacrifice my life for you... the answer is yes. Then trust me. So, like, these powers... 24-seven, you're Wu'd up? Or only in, like, the heat of battle? Tommy. Quit bullshitting. What do you want? Her name is Alana. I met her last night. I've got two years now. But, man, as we all know... it can go away any time, anywhere. Except lately for me, it's not... any time, not anywhere. It's getting to be every night. At my place, just... just... getting that urge when my boyfriend walks through the door, because I just... I don't know what he's gonna do. Ignore me. Fuck me. Hit me. I have to walk away, but I can't. I don't have anyone who can help me. I... I don't have the cash. I mean, I'm still paying down the insurance from a car accident, and... Uh... Uh... I'm sorry. I ju... I'm sorry. Thank you. Anyone else? Hey, uh, what's up? I'm Tommy. - Hi, Tommy. - Hey. I'm an addict. Used to think I just kind of chipped. But... I'm an addict. Heroin. But I haven't used for the last two days. Thanks. I once had eight monthsa couple of years back where I was stone-cold sober. Man, it was... it was good. Just, like, whew! Clear. Um... Be nice to get back to that. So, um... last night... I got in a situation... and I ended up literally finding some scag. It was in my hands, and... and I already started feeling warm. I could even feel my gag reflex... um, flaring up. Just the anticipation of this shit would... would make me puke. I... I mean, it... it looked so fucking pure. It... It was beautiful. But I... I didn't want it. For the first time in a while, I'm feeling like maybe I'm not the fuckup that I thought I was. That... That everyone I know thought I was. And, uh... that's... that's pretty cool. Or, uh... God, this sounds so dumb when I say it out loud, but I have this friend. He's like my brother. He... He's... He... He's like a... a real-life hero, no bullshit. And... And I think maybe I wanna be like him. I wanna help myself first... and then... who knows? Maybe I can be someone's hero. So, uh... Yeah, that's it. I liked your share. - It was good. - Thanks. Yours was bullshit. Dude. You're white-knuckling it. Head's maybe saying no, but every other part of you... I'm just saying, be honest with yourself. This boyfriend? What's his deal? Look, I'm not trying to hit on you. I'm not some weirdo stalker... - I'm just... - Stalker? Nah, definitely not. Not sure about the weirdo part, though. He's a driver for that app, BayRide. You know, the one you can pick your driver on. Well... when you pick Ray, you can get some party favors for your ride. Jesus. What happened to just copping from the corner? The internet happened, old man. - You're kind of a dick, you know that? - Takes one to know one. Listen. If you need anything... I mean... If you wanna talk... or... I can give you my number. Usually the one with more time offers to sponsor. Not to mention the whole guy-girl thing. - Hey, I'm just trying to be... - A hero? Like your friend? Somethin' like that. She needs help, Kai. The kind of help a guy in your position might be able to offer. Doesn't work that way, does it? No. I get it. It's cool, bro. All right, I'm gonna go see what Jen and Lu Xin are cookin' up in the kitchen, okay? You're close. Almost time to rest, my love. I haven't rested... since they took you and Liam away from me. And I won't rest until I see you again. I know I say this all the time. That this isn't real. You're in my head. But it's always good to see youse. Hello, my boy. Da. I found him, Maggie. The one who wields fire. He's going to help us. We need just one more. Five hundred years. No sleep. You're just livin' a dream now, aren't you? Don't. Don't try and convince me otherwise. It's not me trying to convince you. Time to drown out my thoughts. Your thoughts? Or your conscience? Ah, Maggie. I lost that long ago. I'll see youse after, my loves. First one's on the house. Next one... you pay. Ah. Let me ask you something. When you needed money for this place, why not come to me? I couldn't put that on you. Put what on me? Come on, Lu. I take money from you... something happens, I can't pay. If I take money from Six, and something happens, it's between the Triad and me. Mm. Aah. You mean, you can't pay, they take your restaurant? That's what you want, huh? They take it, you walk away. Get out from under your family obligations, the only way you know how. Like I said... I couldn't put that on you. I'm hoping we can all find some closure tonight. Especially you. No such thing. Believe me... I got the scars to prove it. Hey, man. - Yeah. - How you doin'? Just chillin'. Looks like we're in between rounds. Yeah. I think you should come by the shop more. Why? More bodies to take care of? Too soon? - Too soon. - No, it's just that, uh... I thought it'd be cool to kick it like back in the day. Ever since Kai... dropped the bomb on us about, you know... Look, I owe you an apology. For what? Tommy... I blamed you. For the fire. We all did. Now that we know the truth... You carried that blame. And I'm sorry. Y'all just decided I was enough of a fuckup that it could've been me. It should have been me. We didn't know. Oh, shit! Hey, yo, Kai! Jen! Looks like we got ourselves some Gu. Here. Why are you giving me this? To sell. In case this doesn't work. And I'm, uh... Well... I won't need it. Make sure the Tong gets the money. Why are you doing this? Why are you trusting him with your life? You won't understand. You don't have family. I have never, nor will I ever, justify the choices I make to anyone. Especially you. I sit back here. You sit up there. And even if I do die, you will always sit up there. There will always be a Big Brother back here... Maybe it's time for a Big Sister. I may control fire, Alec McCullough may have power over wood. And my son may be the Wu Assassin. But the thought of a Big Sister? You're living in a fantasy world. A Big Brother sees the entire chessboard. If this is what I must do in order to prevent Alec McCullough from destroying us all... You ready? Are you? Aah... Whoa. Oh! Oh! Oh... Kai... Fucking A. It's happening. How long is it going to take? I don't know. All right, well... I'll watch him first. I'll join you. He dies, you die. The only thing we need to exorcise is him. Out of our lives. - People can change. - No. Not him. I meant you. Ah, fuck. Is he dead? No. He knows I'm the Wu Assassin. He knows what happened here. Why the fuck would you tell him that? I have a plan. To get the Wu Xing out of him. This is your plan? It'll work. This is the only thing that's gonna work. He needs to be killed, that's what you said. That's what you know. You just can't do it. I know what I'm doing. - Just give me that stuff. - Just let me do it for you. No, he'll kill you! He tried once. I'm still here. Can you get me that stuff or no? I'm not asking your permission. Stay out of my way. You wanna help me kill the Fire Wu? That's the way we do it. Look. I don't care if you're the Wu Assassin. I don't even know what it means. As far as I'm concerned, you're still the kid that showed up at Chinese School, scared, alone... and with no friends. Until I met you. Help me. Don't help me. Your call. What are you praying for? A good outcome. I joined the Triad when I was 13. I went to prison for the Triad. At 20, I fled the country for the Triad. I came here with nothing. Not even my name. Uncle Six saw my potential, gave me purpose. He's always needed me. And I'll always be valuable to him. I would, and I will... die for him. And him for you? Until you've been stripped of everything that makes a life, you'll never know what nothing is. Am I supposed to feel sorry for you because I grew up here? And because my parents loved me and always made sure I had everything I needed? Because that comes at a cost, too. Perfection is expected. And that makes you very bitter. You smile... but the rage builds. You're the lucky one. No responsibility. No expectations. Just freedom. Hold on to that rage. You may need it someday. It'll be all very different, once that thing is out of your boss. I know. But I'll be the same. No biting. No knives, no kill shots. One of you goes down, can't continue, I'mma call it. All right, go. Stay down. Help me. Please. Are you thirsty? You need water? I need... I just... I need to get out of here. I think they... they want you to stay. I'm talking to you, you fucking little grease spot! Get me out of here. They're trying to kill me. I don't think I can, uh... You've... always wanted to be a gangster, haven't you? Hm? You want to be like me? Work for me? Walk around this neighborhood, and people step aside to let you pass. Cross the street... because they're afraid. That's what you want, right? People to fear you... like they fear me. I can give you what you want, Tommy. Just... get me out of here. Help me, please. You can do it. Fuck Kai! Fuck Kai! Kai doesn't know what the fuck he's doing. This is a mistake. I didn't agree to this! You know, your sister, Lu Xin... they're trying to kill me. You crying piece of shit! You weakling. Do you know who I am? Oh, I forgot. - I'm talking to Tommy fucking Wah. - Oh, fuck! - You are a disgrace. A runt. - No! Let me go! - An embarrassment. - You're burning my arm! Fuck! If I killed you right now, you think anyone would care? No one would. You wanna change that? Huh? You wanna change that? Do something! Step up! Be a man! Let me go! Be a man! Tommy! No! Fuck. Put this someplace safe. What is happening to him? Let it go. Let it go. Let it go. Father. Let it go. Aaah! Is that it? Yes. Let me help you. No. Only Kai can help me now. All that evil in a to-go box? It's what people do with it that makes it evil. Not the thing itself. How long will you be gone? Three days. Maybe four. And this is not gonna be as easy as it was with Uncle Six, right? Like... you have to kill it, him or her, to get the Wu Xing out? Yes. Here, take Tommy's gun, just in case. You okay, man? You look like you could use somethin'. Like what? You tell me. What's your poison? Oh, um... Got any molly? Yeah, man. You know it. How much you want? How much for, like, four pills? Four for a hundo. - Fuck! - What was that? Open the fucking door! Christ, man. The fuck? I'm callin' the cops, asshole! Yeah! You're gonna pay for that, - you piece of shit! - Fuck you! Put it somewhere safe, until I get back. Don't lose it. Don't touch it. What will happen if I do? You really want to find out? Sounds like fun, but I'll pass. Call you when we're headed back. Good morning, Zan. You're up early. The Wu Assassin took the Fire Wu Xing from Uncle Six. I saw it with my own eyes. - Saw the Wu Assassin? - He's Six's son. Kai Jin. Well, my dear. That's a fascinatingly complex detail. And the Wu Xing? This Kai Jin has it? No. But I know who does. Aaah. Aaah. And you want something. What? Power.
