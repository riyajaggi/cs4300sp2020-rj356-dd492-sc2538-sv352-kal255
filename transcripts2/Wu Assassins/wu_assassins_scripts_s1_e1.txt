 Hey, Lu. Heads up. Listen, if you don't want it, I will give it to John Kang, or the kid from Shanghai. Ten o'clock, tomorrow morning. Yes, the white one. Oracle lights, Asanti wheels. Perfect. We'll see you at nine. What are you still doing here? I'm helping Tommy. - Just for tonight. - No, I mean what's happening with the... the food truck idea? You know, traveling around the music festivals. - I love that. - I'm working on it. - It's happening. Don't worry. - If you need help on the money part,

 I could, uh... help you. Dude. Do I look like I need help with the money part? You rea... You really want me to answer that? - I know. - You're the sorriest looking jungle rat I've ever seen in my life. Are you sure you're Chinese? Half. Which half? The one you can't see. Take this to table three. Uh... Eh. Table three. Thank you. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Listen, man, I'm serious. If you need help with the money, I got plenty of money. You, my friend, you have a dream. I'm good, thanks. Okay. But when you're ready, let me know. I'll get you a deal on a truck, we'll trick it out at the shop. It'll be the envy of food truck owners everywhere. As soon as we... explain to them what the word "envy" means. You're not funny. The girl I was with last night, she said I was. - You know where to find me, right? - Hey, stay out of jail. You too! Where's Kai? Kai! I told you no peanuts. In anything. No, you didn't. I told you, right? What? - No peanuts! - There are no peanuts! Come here. Apologize. What did I do? No! I won't do it again. No! Apologize to her, not me! I didn't use any peanuts! Jimmy, get out of here! - Take off. - Fuck! Jimmy, leave! Wait a minute. Whoa, seriously. Hey, put that away. It... It was a misunderstanding. Come on. Okay, come on. Hey, guy. Come on. Come on. Nobody got hurt. It's all good, it's party time... - Let's go! - Bottoms up! What's the matter with you? Are you stupid? Those guys are Triad, they'll fuck you up. They'll blow your brains out, asshole. Get out of here, go. I'll take care of it. Go. You're still awake? Hey, what's up, bro? Kai. Early morning? Late night. Thank you. What is it? Yuet Guk balls. - What is it for? - Stagnation. Why do I need this? You said you're gonna buy your own food truck, hit the road. You're still here. Twice a day, till you're gone. Good night.

Was it someone at the party? Were people fighting in here? No, Kai just... uh... Kai was here? He was doing me a favor, and got into it with that guy Chen... He... He's fine. I... I got him out of here before anything happened. You have to fix this. I don't want Kai to... Kai can take care of himself! And those guys, they won't mess with a friend of mine. They're my brothers. No, they're fucking criminals! And I don't want them in here, okay? This is my restaurant, too. I don't need my... my sister's permission to have a... a little... You know? They're my family. I'm your family. Don't worry about it. I'll clean it up. Have you ever heard of Little Pete? He was the first Chinese millionaire in the United States. The, uh... The first Chinaman to refuse to carry papers required by the Geary Act. The first dragon head in Chinatown. People said crossing Little Pete was like... erasing your name from God's journal. Do you believe in God? Hm? Everybody wanted a piece of Little Pete. Hatchet men were... were imported from China to assassinate him. The Irish tried to burn him out of the docks. The police came after him with clubs and silly ordinances, designed to kill his soul and drive him out of Chinatown. Everything failed. You know why? Because, like me... Little Pete was willing to do whatever's necessary to protect his business, his people, his territory. I want you to tell Alec McCullough... where he'll end up, should he continue his incursions into Chinatown. Okay? Yeah? Okay. Oh, wait a minute. On second thought, I think he'll get the message. Two bodies were found in a shipping container this morning. Shot, execution-style. Triad's fingerprints are all over this. The victims were known associates of Alec McCullough. Operates mostly in Europe. Six months ago, he relocated to San Francisco. Now, McCullough's already tried to squeeze into Chinatown, but the dragon head, Uncle Six, ain't havin' it. My Spidey sense says we're gonna have a gang war if we don't calm things down. Let 'em take each other out. Less work for us. There's not gonna be a gang war in Chinatown, Bendix. Don't you wanna know why? 'Cause we're gonna be all over this shit before McCullough gets any more situated. That's why. McCullough's number two... Grisha Babinov. He's recruited Uncle Six's own guy, Lu Xin Lee, to put together a crew. Six catches wind of that, it ain't gonna sit well. Inspector Gavin. She's from Bayview. She's been workin' Vice over there. She's gonna embed in Lee's crew. Chinese ain't gonna hire a girl to steal cars, boss. Gavin's here because she speaks fluent Russian, just like Babinov. She's got experience liberating cars from their rightful owners, just like Babinov. She's a fresh face. Sorry, Cap. You fuck up in Vice, you go home with a canker sore. You fuck up in Chinatown, you don't go home. Or I don't. You don't have to worry about me, Bendix. The only thing that you got on me... is a smaller dick. All right, all right. Let's go. UC assignments are there in your files. You got eyes and ears on the Triad. You hear anything ugly, I wanna know about it. One more thing. This McCullough... He's a jaundiced motherfucker. Watch yourselves. ♪ Do what you, do what you ♪ - ♪ Do what you do - ♪ Do what you do ♪ - Kung Pao Sting and Happy Family. - Thanks. - Hannah. - What's up, Kai? - Dragon Shrimp? - Is there any other kind? Hey, boss. How we doing on shrimp? Uh, I'll go get some more. - Start pushing the squid. - Okay. Uh, Hannah... - how'd you like to try the squid? - No. All right, no squid. Most people knock, bro. I'm aware. What we got here? Mm, it's good. Moo goo wrap, and lemon chicken salad. Seriously, how much money can you make in a food truck? Not as much as my boss. How much you make selling cars? Not enough, which is why I also steal them. You know what I don't get? You live like a king, but I never see you working. I live like a dog, bro, and all I do is work. Yeah, but that's your problem right there, brother. You think if you don't work like a dog, you're never gonna get anywhere. You gotta... You gotta un-Confucius that brain of yours, man. But, listen, uh... put a pin in that, 'cause I heard about what happened last night with Chen and Lau. After you left... those guys took it out on Tommy, who tried to tell them you're protected, but... who listens to Tommy, right? Fuck. Yeah. You might wanna call Uncle Six. No. Hannah! - Thanks, Kai. See you tomorrow. - See you tomorrow. They're not gonna let this go. The Triad will come for you. So be ready. - How about you just talk to them for me? - Doesn't work that way, brother. Come on. Take it. For what? Who am I gonna shoot? How about you just don't get shot? Shit! Shit! Don't move. Stay put. Hang up. Hang up! I've been looking for you, Kai. This is the Monk Piece. It holds the power of a thousand monks. Those powers are yours now. What was that? That is what's going to kill you, if you don't listen to me. Those warlords were the first to be corrupted by the elemental powers of the Wu. Earth, Water, Metal, Wood, and Fire. They waged war against ancient China, leaving the land awash in blood, until a thousand holy monks sacrificed themselves to empower a Chosen One to stop them. What's this got to do with me? Where are we? This place is the Path. It exists between Heaven and Earth. You're here because the Wu Powers are still with us. Five new warlords are converging on San Francisco as we speak. You will stop them. - How? - By killing them. I'm not a killer. I'm a chef. No, Kai. You are the Wu Assassin. You are the Chosen One. The Monk Piece is in you. It gives you the power of the Thousand Monks. Their strength flows through you. Their faces protect you. - I'm going home. - Yes. And when you do... you'll find the Wu and kill them... before they destroy your world like they did mine. Where am I? You're in the hospital, sir. Just had an accident. - Something... Something happened to me... - Yes. You were found on the street. We're gonna take care of you. You've been imbued with the power of the Thousand Monks. You are the Wu Assassin. Their faces will protect you so you can do what they could not. - Jenny! Hey. - Hey! What happened? - I had an accident. - Yeah, I know. The hospital called me. I'm in your phone. Emergency contact? Oh, sorry. Are you okay? Tommy asked me to cook. - I'm sorry if shit happened. - Shit did happen. You know shit happened. Tommy? What's... What's the matter with you? You don't just... take on the Triad like that. What were you thinking? I was thinking they broke Jimmy's nose. And, you know, Tommy never told us not to put peanuts in the... This isn't about peanuts. It's so like you. Just can't get out of your own way. I know. Thanks for the lecture. Could you come work for me? You don't belong in a food truck, and I could really use you in my kitchen. Sorry... but I've got my own problems right now. Thanks for coming to get me. Yeah. She looked mad. She's always mad. "There's no friendship without love, and no love without friendship." Hm? I don't have time for your Confucius bullshit right now, Mr. Young. Confucius? - Tony Robbins. - Oh, my God. He's my human potential thought leader. I'm doing this cleanse, right? Clear my mind, you know, and then Tony said... Mr. Young... I don't care what Tony says. Have a good day. - Here you go, Lu Xin. - Thank you, DeeDee. - So, what are you doing later tonight? - Dinner with the hubby. Yeah, you tell him I'll bring the wine. Hi. A little birdie told me that you're looking to hire some people. Hm? Short, Latino dude? Works on auto parts? Ring a bell? The same irritating little fuckbird... also told me that you got a problem with women. That true? DeeDee. Do I have a problem with women? No. I think that, um... I think you're at the wrong table. I'm at the right table. Can I get you anything to eat, hon? Mm-mm. No, thanks.

Chow's. Tell the guys. This used to be the Song Garden. Well, they couldn't pay their rents. Well... What do you think? About what? What it could be. What could it be? Yours. Here. Bar could be here. Kitchen behind the glass. Hm? I'm gonna make the terms very favorable. Ten years... it'll be yours. What do you think? No, thanks. I'm good. Don't tell me you still feel you don't belong here. You're my son. Everyone accepts that except you. - I don't need your help. - Everybody needs my help. Not me. No, not you. Never you. You see, that's what I don't understand. I plucked you out of the bowels of a ship. Saved you from a life of bondage. Raised you in my home. Sent you to school. Introduced to you... - families whose children are your best... - I've heard this story. You talk as if your father could've done any of it for you? Look! My father loved me and he got me here!

They're lined up around the corner. It's insane. I owe you an apology. It's in the past. - Already forgot about it. - Don't... - What? - Don't... - Don't do that. - Don't do what? Can you just accept my apology without making me feel like shit? Okay. I accept your apology. - That it? - I want you to know, if Kai hadn't fucked everything up last night, you never even would've known we were here. That's the way I do things, okay? I'm not a total fuckup. I don't... I don't think you're a total fuckup. I need money. It's for rent. - For rent? - Uh... I'm clean. Look. Seriously, I don't know what I spend my money on. I don't. It just, you know, just... poof. I get paid on Friday, rent's due tomorrow. I just need you to float me for a couple days. - What are you doing? - I'm... Can you just please forget about the Triad? You've been talking to Mom and Dad? No. No! Mom and Dad think I'm a fuck-up. Who cares what Mom and Dad think? You can just work here. With me. - In your restaurant. - Yes, in my restaurant. Our restaurant. You took a loan from Uncle Six. - You didn't think I knew, did you? - You're a fucking sneak... What would Mom and Dad say if they knew their beloved golden child borrowed money from the Triad, - to renovate her beloved restaurant? - Tommy... No, bullshit! Come on! It's just $1,200. That is nothing to you. It's just 1,200 bucks for two days. That's it. - For rent. - For rent, yes. For rent. Shit! Friday. You better not be fucking with me. I'm not fucking with you. Thank you. By the way, your two new servers are illegal. Be careful. And, uh... Angela, the new girl? She's too easy on the campers. She's gotta turn those tables. Can you stay tonight? I could really use your help. Friday. Don't lie to me! Which key is it? Where's the key? Tell me where he is! What's your business, old man? What's yours? Leave! Walk on, old man. Are you deaf? I said, "Are you deaf?" Where is he? Huh? You need to kill them. I told you. I'm not a killer. The Wu Assassin is a hero and a killer, Kai. And you are the Wu Assassin. - No. Find another way. - There is no other way. The Monk Piece is in you. Evil is attracted to it. Evil will find you now. If you don't kill it, it'll kill you. And not just you... but all who stand close to you. Mr. Young. How many more? Two... outside. Asshole! Who are you? I'm a chef. There's an old proverb. "It is better to be a dog in peaceful times, than a man in times of unrest." The good people of Chinatown have come to embrace this axiom... as the Triad has come to rely on the feud and vendetta code of old China to enforce it. The streets of Chinatown are ruled by face, fate and favor. They flow from my hand, to the tongues and fists of my soldiers. Chinatown understands us. I thought you did, too. But then, you took matters into your own hands. We didn't know he was protected. We thought he was a chef. A cook. Nobody special. Everyone is someone special until I tell you they're not. The chef... He did this to you? And what did you do to him? Nothing. We waited, but he never came home. So, who worked you over? Some old guy. Bald. A monk. Never seen him before. But he was strong. We should be on the lookout for him. Pity he's not here to protect you now. Shit! What is that? Just give me a second, all right? Yeah, you guys are... How did you do that? Huh? Oh. I have never seen anyone... do what I saw you do. Hey... who are you? I'm the Wu Assassin.
