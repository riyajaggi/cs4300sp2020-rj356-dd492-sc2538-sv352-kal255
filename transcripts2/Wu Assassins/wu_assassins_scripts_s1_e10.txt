 I'm going to fucking kill her. And I'm going to fucking help you. After we finish this. Brother... I know how you feel. Don't lose yourself like I did. There's too much at stake. I'll meet you downstairs. This is for you. - If anything happens to me... - Keep it. Good day to you, Mr. Jin. Nice to meet you.

 You know the deal. You give me the Earth Wu Xing, and I give you little Tommy boy. Drop your weapons. Or the next shot won't miss. Trust me. Trust the plan. Now, show me the Wu Xing. What? I was just thinking about that time in Chinese School, when those kids were laughing at you, calling you a jungle rat. You told them to. Yeah. I know... but I'm not laughing anymore.

 Whatever happens, I got your back. Mr. Jin? Fuck! Hush. Mr. Jin. I'll take that Wu Xing now. Heal him first. I can see it, behind those eyes. Someone's daddy issues swirling around. All that rage... pain, loss. Poor Six. Dead and gone. And you couldn't save him. Just understand this. He was a means to an end. As are you. And when this is over... You'll be dead. Fuck. You really bought into that Ying Ying bullshit, didn't you? "Inhale death, exhale life." I remember that shit like it was yesterday. You're not the only one whose family had to be sacrificed for the greater good. Heal him. Right now. Okay. Easy. Easy. Easy. You see? I'm not a total monster. You like games, Mr. Jin? 'Cause I fucking love them. Occupies time. Let's be honest. I've had a lot of that. There's one game I quite like. It's called Go. Ever play it? See, most modern civilizations think chess is the ultimate game of strategy. Chess has only 20 opening moves, whereas Go... has 361. And I have played them all. I know what you're thinking. You're thinking about your next move, aren't you? Miss Wah there... using her fire power to take out my men. Alas... she won't get far. Because water beats fire. Doesn’t it? Meanwhile... your big friend over here... He's gonna shepherd wee Tommy away to safety. How do we defeat those pesky snipers? And let's not forget about your double agent. Thing is... she's not feelin' herself right now. Which does not bode well for you. Every angle you've contemplated, every move that you're considering... Done it. Forgotten it. All your best laid plans, they're just my memories, Mr. Jin. So why do you bother? Look. I have Water... Metal and Fire under my power. What've you got? A car thief and a junkie. Give it up. And give me... the fucking Wu Xing... now. Sorry. No! Thank you, Kai. What's happening, Kai? You've played an excellent game. The five Wu Xing... need human hosts to activate the gate. At last... I'm going home. Kai! What the fuck is goin' on? What happens now? Something's wrong! Kai... - Alec. - He's going to his family! I have to stop him. I have to fix this. - No, we'll help you. We're here. - You can't help me. Go! Go to that gate! It's the way home! - Go! Go to the gate! - We're not leaving you. You fucking bitch! I don't want any trouble. No! Guys! We gotta go through the gate, now! - Christine! Let's go! - Kai! Jen! Come on! Da? Alec? I can’t believe it’s you. I can’t believe I'm really here! - Oh, my beautiful. - Oh... What happened to you? You look different. - Aah... - Your voice sounds different. - I... I don't have time to explain... - What are you wearing? Oh, you’re so beautiful. More beautiful than I remember. What is this? Alec... what's goin' on? We have to leave. - What? - Come. Stop! I dinna recognize you. What's wrong with you? - Margaret. - You've got the devil in you. Margaret... I don't have time to explain to you right now, but we have to go, come. Stop it! Let me go! - Come on. Let's... - Stop. You're hurting me! - I'm sorry. - Liam, run! - Now! - No! Come here, boy, come here! Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here, come here. Look at me. See me. You see me? You can see me. I'm your father. - I'm your father! - Get off him! I'm trying to save your lives! I have to get away from this place! I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. Margaret... I swear to you... on everything that's holy and true. This is me. This is me. You have to believe. You're scaring me. I am so sorry. I have to keep you safe. I have to make this right. I can't lose you again. It's me. Me. Maggie. Maggie! Stay with the boy. Where's Da? I know you're there, Jin! The Wu Xing have gone back to Heaven. Your mission is over. As is mine. Leave me and my family in peace! Maggie! Alec? Hah! Da! Inhale death... Exhale life. - No! - Liam! Look away! Liam, don't look. Please! Ma. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. One roast goose, crazy man! Uh... Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Okay. - I got it. Where's my goose? We need it two minutes ago. - 21 up. - Okay. All right, all right! Food is on point. Tables are happy. You must be doin' somethin' right. Come on, let's go. What are you doing? Jenny and Lu are waiting. - All right. - Come on, they're hungry. What is this? Oh, look what they dragged out the kitchen, finally. - Yeah, for real. This fool forgot. - Wow. Nice of you, Kai. - I didn't forget. - Yeah, you did. We were busy. - You're always busy. You gotta make time. - You know who else is busy? Me. And I'm here. Phone's away. It's family time. Okay. Okay. So, we've got some wok-fried tiger prawn - in lemongrass and chili sauce, okay? - Where'd you find this guy? He's amazing. - That is a plate of vegetables. - Wow, very descriptive. - Did you teach him? - Yeah. I'm on a break. - Really, Tommy? - Doesn’t mean I can't practice. - You're taking it seriously? - Shit. I'm re-learning this place from the ground up. Soon, just watch, I'll be in the kitchen sous-chefing like a motherfucker, with his ass. - We'll skip that part, bro. - All right, whatever, man. Look. Point is, I got this place on lock. You've got nothin' to worry about. - I'm proud of you. - Thank you. - Yeah, me too. - Thanks. Thank you. Thanks. Well, shall we eat? - Yeah. - Yeah. Oh. wait, hold on. Okay, so, um... given that this is the first of many a family dinner to come, I just... I wanted to, um... I just wanted to start by, uh... There's something I wanna give you, Jen, if I can find it. Here. - Oh. - 30 days. I mean, technically, I've got 44, but they don't exactly have a chip for that. Look, the point is... you never gave up on me. None of you did. But, Jen... you, uh... I want you to have this. Thank you. Come here. Word on the street is she's in Macau. Meeting with all the big bosses, paying respects. I wanna know when she's back here. Guys, come on. We all agreed. - No business at family dinner. - You're right. Let's make a toast. - All right. - Who wants to do it? - Kai? - Who wants to do it? Um... Jenny, just do it. This is the good stuff, right? Top shelf. Yeah, skip me, man. - Pour some shots, excluding Tommy. - Yeah, don't give me one. Okay. So... We'll do a small one for you, 'cause I know how you get. I can do this. Okay... Uh... I know that we've spent the last six weeks trying to sort through everything, and... probably spend another six weeks or... six months or, I don't know... maybe even another six years trying to make sense of it all. We can't pretend that we can ever go back to what once was, and I don't think we can go back to who we were, either. No matter how hard we try. But we can move forward. We can learn from our experiences, find some balance. Something... I don't know. I don't know. But can we, um... Let's just... promise that we will always be there for each other. No matter who we are, what we do... or what we've done. Should've wrote that shit down. Cheers. - Gan Bei. - Gan Bei. - Gan Bei. - Cheers. Love you guys. Love you too. Oh! Chinese do a lot of things right. - Whiskey is not one of them. - All right, let's eat, man. - It's getting cold. - I like it. Bro. - What? - What are you doing? Guys... Money never sleeps, right? - Lu, come on. - Actually, um... just gotta excuse myself, I got some business to take care of. - What? Come on. - Oh, man. Hey, you got something going on tonight? Yes, I do. Wanna know what it is? - No. God, no. - We'll save some food for you. - Keep that to yourself. - Better that way. All right, hurry up. Hey, Lu. Maybe one of these days, you'll go legit, yeah? Yeah. Maybe. UNCLE SIX LIVES Those things will kill you. But, then again... you've cheated death a few times. Nice dress. Everyone's inside, if you wanna join 'em. Uh... No. If I went in there, there'll probably be a lot of talk about what happened, and... I've been thinking about it too much, as it is. Yeah. I've been thinking about it, too. Still having trouble getting over it. Is that why you still keep playing gangster? Look, since Six's death, there's been a power vacuum. There's a lot of talk about you downtown. You should be careful. We are who we are. I think I'm gonna take a drive. You know, clear my head, figure things out. See what else is out there. One of those long drives, huh? I'd ask you to come, but... I hope you find what you're looking for... Christine. I hope you find peace, Lu Xin. What was that for? I'll see you around. Uh... That's my car. Was! Hm. - ...it was like $1,400. - Should we pack this? What is that? - Is she new? - What the fuck? - I'll take care of it. - Thank you. - It's on Mom and Dad. - Yeah. - Fire her? Okay. - Yup, please. Thank you. Thank you. So... So. It's good to see you back here again. You too. But... it's also good not seeing you here. Excuse me? - I mean... - I know what you meant. So, we haven't talked much about what happened. Not much to talk about. When you stayed behind... was it because of the Dao, or because you wanted to kill Alec for what he did to Uncle Six? He needed to be stopped. That's not what I'm asking. I'm gonna go check up on Tommy. When you're ready to talk about it, I'll be here. I'll take a Seven and Seven. Jenny Wah. Roland Ong. How are you? Good. Busy. I haven't seen you in a while. Have you been here this whole time? I'm hearing through the grapevine you're trying to get out of the family business, and yet, here you are, back behind the bar. I was looking for my brother. How's Tommy doin'? Good. Great, actually. He's working here, sorting things out. Great. And you? You sorting things out or you got plans? - Maybe something. - She says, coyly. I figure it was time to use my business degree. Got a few meetings with some VCs in the Valley. Nothing glamorous. Well, if nothing glamorous is what you're into... I'd ask if you ever thought about public service. What? You're joking, right? I don't know if you remember this, but back in high school, you told me that I had a terrible sense of humor, and that I should never, ever make a joke. I've heeded that advice for a long time. So, yeah. I'm serious. I'd like to talk to you about what you can do for Chinatown. Hi, Kai. Ying Ying? In the flesh. Sorry, Kai. It's not over yet. The world still needs the Wu Assassin.
