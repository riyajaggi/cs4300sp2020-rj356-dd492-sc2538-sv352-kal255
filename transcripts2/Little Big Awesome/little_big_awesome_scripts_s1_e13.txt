 But I could join you at the top of this here tower. Crane time. Move it up! Okay. A real crane. We both win! Why won't the tower fall, Lennon? I don't know, but I wanna see those crazy falling blocks so bad! Whoo-hoo! - Yes! - That was so satisfying. Sorry about your little tower, boys. Forget the tower. That was one of the best smash-'em-ups I've ever seen! Well, thank you very much.

 Allow me to introduce myself. The name is Sheena, Stunt Disc extraordinaire! Cool! Was your stunt smash-ifying our game? No, I'm trying to break the Planetopolis record for the longest throw. Between you dudes and me, I don't think my partner has the arms for it. Sheena, please, we're blushing. We, Gluko and Lennon-- that's me-- are totally down to help you break the throwing record. Didn't even ask once. I know, but I really want you to! Please?! Please?! You think you're really up for it? We have no much upness. You'll see. Let's go throw! Ha ha! Hurting self.! Sorry. Now that was an awesome smash-'em-up, boys! Go, Gluko, go! Go, Gluko, go! Love that energy. Prepare to be broken, record! Sorry. I was talking about a world record, not you. Here we go! I'm gonna need a little more air than that, dudes. I am gonna totally air-ify you so hard. What is the deal, you guys? I'm gonna be so real with you right now. We totally wanna help you break the record, but we're, um, a little scared. A lot scared. That if we throw you too far, you'll get hurt. Sure, sure. When I was younger, I was afraid to fly, like you're afraid to throw me, but I confronted that fear, and now I love to fly! So do you guys wanna get radical with me, or what? - Whisper, whisper. - Whisper. - Question. - Answer whisper. Confer, confer. Yes, please! We should have plenty of room to throw you out here. Not bad. But I need to fly over Non-Central Park if I wanna break that record. Gluko, slingshot-ify yourself. That'll give us the thrust we need. Kiss that record goodbye. Hey, record. How you doing? Let's fly. Whoo! She's totally gonna break-ify the world record! Flap, flap, flap, flap! We have to go find Sheena. Come on. No! Bounce back! Stop. Please! You coming, buddy? No way. She fell into the Uncharted Territories. I'm not going in there. You've heard the same stories I have. That place is filled with c-callous Comebackatyas and brutal Bouncies. It's too scary for me. But like you just said, those are just stories. No, my jelly-filled BFF, they're not. Flash back with me. All right. It was long ago, but you and I were already the best friends ever. We were playing in the park until you got all tuckered out. Ha ha! I tired. Naptime. While you slept, cuter than anyone has in all time, something caught my eye in the trees that mark the beginning of the... - Uncharted Territories. - Uncharted Territories. This is a very, very bad idea. Silly Stuhven, there are no bad ideas. There are probably new friends in there for us to make. There are no friends! The worst part was that all of my screaming woke you up from your sweet, angelic nap. You were cranky for the rest of the day. Well, the nap and cranky parts check out, but you probably just imagine-ified the rest of it. No way. It was really real. Just ask Stuhven. Hey, Stuhven, we need you! You in there? It's a note. It says... Aww, he said, "Love." He also said he's not going into the Uncharted Territories, and neither should we. - But we have to. - Not this time. How is it that I'm being the responsible one here? It's supposed to be you. Well, let's just do this together. I'm sure it's fine in there. Whoo, sure is dark-rafull. Hey, Mr. Sun! Can you please shine some light into the Uncharted Territories? What?! No way! That place scares my rays. See?! Just come on. It's almost like we're being watched. Don't be ridiculous, Lennon. Nothing to worry about. That's probably just some kind of weird bird. Nuh! I'm outta here! That's dude's got the right idea. We have to keep going till we find Sheena. Sheena?! Can you hear me?! Are you out there? If so, could you come here so we can leave and I don't have to start crying? Run! It's the Bouncies! Duck! It's the Comebackatyas. I don't even know what those are! We gotta get out of here! I need you to be braver-ful. I mean, what are you gonna do, hide your head in the sand and pretend you're not here? Great idea, Gluko! Bye now. Not bad. I already feel better. Come on, Lennon. You can't stay like this forever. Sure I can. I live here now. Well, all right. If you really need to live with your head in the sand to calm-ify your fear, then I will, too. Ooh, great choice. It's awesome down here. Don't freak out, Gluko. I know you don't like bugs, but I'm sure this worm is a great guy. Yeah, it's true. I'm fine. I'm fine! Mostly. Wow, this guy must be a really great friend, 'cause I could totally crawl on his head right now, and he's playing it so cool. Boundaries, dude. You're being so brave for me, buddy. Let's be brave together. Come on. Let's find Sheena. I'll miss you forever! I can't believe I was so scared. There's nothing dangerous here. I would like to please retract my last sentence. What are we gonna do, Lennon? We're stuck in this net, and Sheena still needs help-ifying. Did someone say, "Help"? You found us trying to find you. Figured you boys would try to find me, so I've been trying to find you first. Aww, that's so nice. Now let's get out of here. I know I said I'd be brave, Gluko, but this place still gives me the scares. Not until you conquer your fear like I did with flying. But what about breaking the record for longest throw? That was just for fun. But helping a friend conquer their fear is way more important. Now let's go face your fears. Guys, scary things. We should have left when we had the chance. Scary. You need to face your fear. Face mine, too! I'm too scared to do it. Who dares chart the Uncharted Territories? We do, and, you can't scare us. We're not looking for trouble. We just wanted to find our friend Sheena and break a world record. Did you say, "Sheena"? Cousin Peevy? Is that you? Hey, what's up, girl? You got, like, so big, I didn't recognize you. Hey, come on, guys. It's totally cool. Look, Lennon. The Comebackatyas were just boomerangs. And the Bouncies are just kickballs. And the sea monsters were just regular monsters. I guess I really didn't need to be scared after all. Ooh, yeah, sorry about that. We all got lost in the Uncharted Territories, and no one came looking for us due to all the scary stories about this place. See, Lennon? If you hadn't faced your fear, I wouldn't have found my cousin! Aw, bring it in, man! I meant Peevy, but this is cool. Look, rays. That's not scary. That's love. We certainly turned this place around, didn't we, gentlemen? You were right, Gluko. It's totally nice in here. But no time to rest yet. We've got one more thing to do. Just a little more. Now! She broke the record! Not again! Don't worry, guys! We're okay! Psst, Lennon. Do you know what today is? Lennon. Happy steenth birthday, Gluko! Please tell me there's two of you. A precious Lennon doll. It's a birthday dream. Yeah! Present time. Presents. Ripping and tearing open. A finger gymnastics set. I love it. Finger vault! Finger floor routine. Your hard work finally paid off, fingers, just like I told you. You always believed in us. And I always will. Now it's time to get my goat. - Goat? - You know, the whole being assigned a goat for your steenth birthday thing. No, solids like me don't have steenth birthdays or get assigned livestock. Well, that stinks. It's so cool. You get a goat, you know, and you do stuff with it, and then other stuff happens. Maybe you should research this a little more. Nah. This is my goat rite. It's in my jelly. There are three sure things in a jelly's life. A jelly will take so many naps, it will love sandwiches, and it will get a goat. I'm sure goat-keeping will come all natural to me. My goat! To Grandma's house! Bursting in! Hi, Grandma. Grandma's birthday babka is here. You have a special visitor. My goat. - Whoa! - Beelining, kneeling, embracing. It's happer-ning, Lennon. I'm a true jelly steen. How do I look? Ooh, strike a pose. Very steenly and mature. Hello, Mr. Goat, sir. My hat. Yes. Ha ha! You like that hat? It's sesame flavored. Okay, pat and step away. I'm a steen now. Let's go buy nature calendars. Pump the brakes, boys. Gluko, goat represents first steps into jelly steenhood, but before you play, you must learn goat's ways. This manual say everything to know about taking care of goat. Grandma read you the opening. Gonna read it. Not Gluko! You read! "In the beginning, jelly giants "were just regular giants who lived in a cave "surrounding the great jelly fountain. "And they napped. How they napped." "Then one fateful night, a goat called out." "And again "until one of the giants rose up. "She went to the goat and asked it to please be quiet "so she and her friends could get in some serious naptime. "Touched by the polite request "and the fact that this giant stood up for her friends "the goat granted her and the others jelly powers. "To show their gratitude, the jelly giants cared for the goat. "Now when their steenth birthday arrives, "all jelly giants must prove their jelly-ness "by taking care of a goat. "Only then will the newly matured jelly receive the Great Prize." I get a great prize?! What is it? Is different for every jelly. Read manual. Watch goat's color changes. He turn purple, you do something right. He turn another color, you do it wrong! I'm gonna purple-ize this goat so hard and get that prize. Wait! You didn't read the manual! Don't worry, Lennon. I've got an instinct for knowing what goats need. Pudding rides! Not to be a wet pudding blanket, but according to the manual, goats don't like getting drenched in pudding. You must be reading that book oppositely. Everyone likes getting covered in pudding. Let's ride. Go on, boy. Isn't this fun, Goat? Mehh. Here comes the big drop! Mehh! He's turning green. Gluko, we have to dry him off. Yeah, good thinking. And he must be starver-ing after all that action. Let's let him dry out in the rays while I get us all some taffy. Don't tell Gluko about this. It's his birthday, and I want him to think he's doing a good job. Okay, good. Yep, have some hat flap. Approaching with taffy in hand. Look, Lennon. He's purple-fied. I knew it. Just the sight of taffy is making Goat happy. Good job, Gluko. Taffy for you. Taffy for me. Mehh. Aww. looks like the little guy is bored. Or he's tired. But, nope, it's probably the bored thing you said. Perfect! I know just what to do next! Hey, I've got a crazy idea. Why don't we skip, um, whatever show this is and, I don't know, go home for our birthday naps? I love that idea, but Grandma gifted these tickets to me, and she said they were really hard to get. Don't worry. You and Goat are gonna love the show. What is it, anyway? Shh. It's called "Music to be Annoyed By." No! Don't worry, little guy. I'll help you get some sleep time. Hey, this is terrible! I love it! Goat is so purple. Do I know goats, or what? Heh. Come on. Let's all dance to celebrate. Sorry about this, Mr. Goat. Making the goat dance to save my best friend. Look at this goat so naturally dancing. Yeah! Whoo! Whoa!. Mehh. Lennon, what am I looking at? I'm just, um, taking care of your goat behind your back, but in my defense, I'm a great friend. The best! But why? I was making the goat purple-fied just fine. Well, actually you were doing stuff the manual said not to do, so I had to do other stuff to reverse that stuff when you weren't looking, and those times, the goat turned purple. Lennon, I admit it. I can't figure out what the goat needs. I fail-ified. I'll never get the Great Prize. And this wonderful, delicate, little goat is super sad. Don't say that. I was watching you this whole time, as you know, never in a creepy way, but always a helpful one, and you've been trying so hard, just a little too hard. I think you need to calm down and trust yourself. Lennon, you are so good with the goat. Will you help me? Always! Even when you don't want me to. Not to worry. There are really only three essential steps to taking care of your goat. You've got to feed it... groom it... and nurture its spirit. Thanks for the help, buddy. Got it, Glukster. Watching you take care of that goat was like watching a person carry a very tall cake that they have no business carrying. - Mehh. - No! Goat's still not purple. I'm sorry, Gluko. I really thought all your hard work would have done it, and I know how much you wanted that prize. I don't even care about the prize anymore. I just wanted to prove myself as a jelly giant steen and make this nice goat happy. Congratulations, my jelly fledgling. You have earned the Great Prize. You can talk? Could you talk this entire time? And how did I earn the prize? You were so many colors that weren't purple. None of that matters, my budding jelly. The real challenge was caring enough to try at all, to open thine eyes and see the error of one's ways. As such, I declare you a true jelly steen and bestow upon you the greatest prize of all. A goatee. I love it, Mr. Goat. Please, my name is Jim Ambrose Ambrose. Thank you, Jim Ambrose Ambrose. Now I must go, for another jelly giant awaits! I never would have succeededed without you, Lennon. Hair, you deserve this. Thank you. You're a jelly angel. My little latke is all grown up. Sort of. Chirp.
