 - You're so awesome. - You're so awesome. - Ha ha! Both. - Never leave me. I love picnic day, Gluko, the wind in my hair, the ants in my pants. Me, too, Lennon. My tummy's so jacked for this peanut butter sammy. My dream was to be a cheese sandwich, but I guess that was unrealistic. Gluko, we have to let this sandwich live its dream. I had my heart set on peanut butter. But, okay, cheese, it is.

 I made it! I'm on top of the world! Now I'm a panini. Is the Freak Out 4K race today? Run! I believe in you. Freak out! Maybe it has something to do with that guy. You will never escape. Cool! Mech suit! Aw, thank you! Aren't you sweet? Stop talking to them. We are here for one reason only, to lick the top of every building in town. Then Townopolis will be mine!

 that only works with iced creams and frankfurters. We'll see about that. Lick. We can't let you do that. It's wrong and really, really unsanitary. Yeah. You're gonna have to lick us first. Eww. You want him to lick us? What? Mech Suit, assume battle stance. That was very graceful. It was my dream to be a ballerina. Really? Well, show us some more sweet moves. Well, I am working, but if you insist. Tour jeté! So beautiful. Grand battement. Delivery from the Townopolis Conservatory of the Dance. I got in. My dreams have come true. Yay! Eject. Whoa! I love a good grand jeté. It's so cute. I am not cute! Sorry, little guy. We were just trying to help your suit follow his dreams. "Widdle guy?" You wanna talk about dweams? All my wife, I've dweamed of being a super viwain, the Great Gewemy. But no one takes me sewiously, because I'm twapped in this adowable body. No, no, I was just joking. You are so not cute. Yeah, wight. I'm serious. Right, Gluko? Right. You're definitely not the most precious thing I've ever seen in my whole life. Weally? Then why are you cuddling me wight now? Face it. I should just thwow in the towel. I bet he looks so cute-ified in a towel. Gluko, I think we crushed his dream, his adorable, evil dream. Yeah, but being a supervillain is a terrible dream. I know, but you heard him. He just wants to be taken seriously. Maybe if we help him, he'll realize he doesn't need to be evil to be happy. Or we could snuggle cute animals and eat sammies. Stop. Stop it. No can do, Gluko. It's my dream to help people. If that's your dream, then it's my dream to help you. Well, then, allow me to help you help me. Only if you let me help you help me help you help G-- All wight. We get it. You can be my henchmen. Um, what's a hench-man? I think it's like a helper? Ooh, I love helping. I'm gonna hench so hard. Look, I'm henching this old lady right now. Hey, bad henchman. You bewong to me. Put her down. First things first. If you want to be taken seriously, you'll need a seriously awesome costume. Ha ha! Hahhh! That's it. Fashion show's over. But-- I'm wipping... my costume off in wage. Can I get some help hewe? Thank you. What I weally need is a new evil pwan, one that will command wespect and show the world that there is more to me than my fuwwy extewior. Maybe you could throw a pizza party with day-old pizza. Or hear me out. We can get everyone in town... a present. Sewiously? You guys are tewible at this. Wet's see. We could fill the pwesents with wabid wodents. Welease an awmy of fire-bweathing waptors. Or... steal your gwandma's chair for my thwone. Finawy. The weaction I was waiting fow. If you guys are howified, then this must be most evil pwan yet. No, it's just Grandma's chair, you know, it's-- it's not that comfortable. Yeah, it's lumpy and smells like hot cabbage. Pwease. And I wove cabbage. Let's go. No! What he means is noooo... allow us. We're your helpers. That's what helpers do. Right, Gluko? We can't do this. Stealing is so wrong. And this chair is so heavy. Maybe Grandma will let us borrow it? What's this? Why are my little kugels crying? I can't face her. She'll see my shame-ification. Sorry, Gluko's Grandma. We are in a jam. You may wanna sit down for this. Ooh! Ooh, I love sitting. Yeah. That's what Grandma's talking about. Okay, go. She's so cozyful. The thing is, we need this chair to help someone realize their dreams, even though we know it's wrong. My boys, always helping people. I tell you what. Grandma will sell you her chair so you don't have to take it. Really? You'd do that for us? Of course, my little rugelach. For five watermelons. 2 1/2 watermelons. Three watermelons and a fish in a top hat. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Are we talking about a fish inside a top hat or wearing a top hat, 'cause if he's wearing it, the deal's off. Okay, he no have to wear it. You drive a hard bargain, but deal. Thanks, Grandma. My back.. Don't worry. Maybe now I'll finally straighten my spine on this cold, hard floor... with no cushioning. Why didn't I get carpet? Mwa ha ha. Sweet victowy is mine! Gweat henching, guys. What? I still look cute, don't I? Agh. It's no use. It doesn't matter what I wear or how many chaiws I steal, I'm still nothing but a cutie. Just an idea, but have you ever thought of embracing your cute-itude? Of course you would say that! If you knew what it felt like to be twapped in this body, you would understand. That guy gets it. Gluko's right. Let's face it. You're super cute, okay? You just are. You're the cutest thing in this whole town, and that's never gonna change. Unless you move to a town filled with babies. That's just cwazy enough to work. We did it! We made him good! Yeas, I'll build an infantiwizer way, and turn everyone in Townopolis into babies. Ooh. It's bwilliant. What? No, that's not what we meant. Nope. Too late. I'm doing it. We'll see who's cute then. We have to stop him. Mwah-ha-ha-ha! Ignoring traffic signs? So dangerous. Hug hold. Wook upon me, and despair! He's got a little toy chair. No, don't say that! Cute. Cute. Cute. Cute. Cute. Cute. Cute. Cute. Cute. Cute. You're cuter. Mwah-ha-ha-ha! Hey, they're not babies, They're just dressed like babies, and I am digging it. I'm wearing diapers. Ooh, but they're kinda comfortable. And super absorbent. You look adorable in that bonnet. Food fell out of my mouth, but it stained my bib, not my tuxedo shirt. I feel so free. No, that's not what I wanted. What's happening? It looks like you're a hero. Everyone is loving their diapers. A hewo. I give up. I'll never weach my dweams. Man! I feel terrible. I would feel bad if I didn't feel so cozy and safe. Gentlemen, I cannot believe I'm saying this, but I absolutely love my new paci and diaper. I'm happy for you, Stuhven, but we really let Geremy down. Naturally. You two chaps can't help a villain. You're just too good. Hey, that's wight. You make tewible henchmen. You're fired. I'm gonna do this myself. Well, if that's the case, we're gonna need Grandma's chair back. Ha! Never! Look! Grandma's chair is following his dream of joining the herd. Follow that chair! The chaiw is mine! Mwah-ha-ha. He's so cute when he evil laughs. Don't tell him. Let's just let him have this. - Whoa! Free jelly-filtered hot chocolate. Man, I could really go for another cup. It makes me so warm and cozy-fied. Me, too. You know, if I was a heated beverage, I'd be ho cho. Hiya, Jo. Can we get another-- - Refill? - Refill? No problem, boys. A tofu milk for me, please. All out? Come on, Jo. You're better than this. I gotta get more tofu milk. I don't wanna have to close the shop just to get more. I've never done that before. We'll watch it for you. This shop means a lot to me. You think you can handle it? Or I could ask someone else. No, Jo, no, Jo, no! We can watch the store. I'm so happiful. Well, good for you. Thanks, boys. Your faith in us is even more delicious than your hot chocolate. I still love you. Right back at ya. Anything we should keep in mind? Well, my way of running the place is to always make sure the customer is happy, no matter what. I don't do frowns. I turn 'em upside down. Oop. There we are, little fella. Let me try making a customer happy. Do it. That's hot. There. How's that? Much better. I like where your heart's at, but maybe next time, just use the complimentary cup sleeves. I will be right back before you can shave another sheep. - Just remember-- - Do it your way and keep the customers happy. Thanks, boys. Go get 'em. Now where is that inconvenience store? Hey, wait! I need tofu milk. Stop! Would it kill you to make this inconvenient store a little more convenient? Come on. Really? Hello? This store's always so inconvenient. Why do I shop here? Hello? Hello? I'm in the middle of something. Okay, I'm done now. Well, good for you. Do you have any tofu milk? Yeah, no. But, like, we'll have some soon, in, like, two or six weeks or whatever. But we do have plenty of air fresheners and sausages and bolo ties and kale chips and belt sanders and pianos and stardust and lights and, like, carpet and rubber chickens and eyelash curl--No, you can't have that. That's mine. I guess I gotta go to that tofu farm out in the sticks. Could I get one of those yummy sausages for the road? Sorry. We, like, just sold out. There is no one else even here. Am I inconveniencing you? Yay. That is tight. Job well done, me. I deserve a break. Better call the boys. That tickles. - Hiya, boys. - Hi, Jo! How's everything going over there? Stupendous. Every mug we serve is filled with happiness and hotted chocolate, too. We didn't forget. Good to hear. Hey, you guys okay watching the place for a little while longer? Does a horse snore? Find out in two minutes. Great. See you soon, boys. We were okay watching the shop for a second, but how are we gonna do it for a while? We'll be fine. This is just our first big responsibility, and if we fail, no one will ever trust us ever again. It's no big deal. Wait! We have to do this! It's our first big responsibility! If we don't succeed, no one will ever trust us again! This is huge! Excuse me. Tiny sir, whatever the problem is, we'll handle it. My baby friend here only counts nine marshmallows in his ho cho. There should be ten! You better hurry, fellas. He's about to throw a tantrum. So then I says, "Hey, pal, don't marsh on my mallow." Ha ha! Don't mind me. Ira, Dennis, Caitlin, Sayid, Myles, Kieran, Jack, Mandrake, Sharlene. Yep, no Jerry. I don't get it. Jerry's gotta be around here somewhere. Mallow! Two o'clock! Hey, guys. Say hello to my bro, Carl. We were in the same paintball league. Sorry to interrupt, but I need you to get back to the hot chocolate, Jerry. Duty calls. Holler at me next week. We'll do lunch. We did it! We please-ified everyone. Yes, but we've gotta stay ahead of it from now on. That was too close. Ma'am, on a scale of marmot to bunny rabbit, how happy are you? I don't know. Maybe squirrel? Why only a squirrel? Well, I suppose I could be a little more comfortable, I guess. Okay. Here, here, sit on me. I'm cushy, right? I, need to go f-fishing, Yeah. Man. Not good. Some would even say bad. We need to step it up, Gluko, big time. Hey, buddy. Mind giving me a lift to the tofu farm? Horses really do snore. Looks like you're walking, Jo. I could give you a lift. Not to be a backseat driver, but I'm in a bit of a hurry. Take Henville Road headed east. Not to be a driver, but no. I'm taking Magnolia Boulevard. But that'll take twice as long! Here you go. My hot chocolate is too hot! Here. My hot chocolate is too wet! Run, run, run, run. Don't spill. Don't spill. I used to be hot chocolate. Everyone is leaving! Maybe it's too cold in here? I don't know. Maybe-- Maybe it's too dark in here? It needs to be lightended. Yeah? Well, look at that. Your way was faster. Yeah, yeah. Don't rub it in or anything. Easy, girl. I just need some milk. Come on, now. Foooo. This will be so much simpler if you'd just stand still and do what I say. Stop wiggling, you little stinker. Sorry about that. We'll milk you when you're ready, girl. You wanna talk? Fooo. I hear you. Let it out. Fooo. Fooo. You're right. This is nicer than bossing you around. Any unhappy customers over there? No. Any unhappy customers over there? - Nope. - Yes. I think we're covered, buddy. There's nothing here for anyone not to like. Hi, boys. How's the shoaaaaaa? Surprise! Where--Where--Where's my shop? This is it. Don't you love it? We wanted to make everyone happy, so we decided that getting rid of everything would do the trick. That way, there's nothing left for people not to like. But there's no one here to enjoy my hot chocolate. Also, there's no hot chocolate. This is bad. - This is-- - So very bad. Boys, get a grip! We just tried so hard... to make everyone happy. Now no one will ever trust us again. Boys! It's okay. Just relax. You know what? Having you watch the place was a big responsibility. But even though you dismantled my shop, you did it 'cause you wanted people to be happy. That's what makes you both so crazy special. I'm just gonna have to build a new shop, is all. Wait. Let us fix it. Yes! Let us make you a new shop. Please, please, please. Well, I don't know. Fooo. A new friend helped me realize something today. Sometimes folks need to dance to their own tune. Maybe when I wanna zig, others wanna zag, and that's okay. Listen. You two build me a new shop, but this time, do it your way. Do that, and I'm sure folks'll love it, and so will I. Get ready for... The new Ho Cho Jo's! Welcome to Gluko and Lennon's Hot Chocolate Jo's Fun Time Emporium. This is all the stuff we love! We have a lemon meringue maze. Which you can eat your way out of. And here we have a hot tub ride. Hot tub ride! This is so cool, I guess. Where is everyone getting the hot chocolate from? Wow! It is kinda perfect! For today. Dance, dance, celebration dance. So, can we watch your house tomorrow? Absolutely not. Why? Chirp.
