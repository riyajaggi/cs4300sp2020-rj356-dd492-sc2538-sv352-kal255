 - You're so awesome. - You're so awesome. - Ha ha! Both. - Never leave me. Puppies. Fact or furry fiction? There are those who believe that these adorable beings once populated Planetopolis, until they messed with the wrong ball of yarn. Kitten yarn. After an epic puppy-kitten feud, the puppies went on the run, into space. Legend has it that one day they'll return in a spectacular puppy shower

 to remind us all just how adorable they are. Puppy expert and astronomer Penelope Pitt-Plebop III has been studying the phenomenon. According to my calculations, at precisely midnight tonight, there will be a puppy shower the likes of which Planetopolis has never seen. While some, like Penelope, believe in puppy showers, others believe that they are silly baloney. Stuhven, quit talking over the documentary. Documentary? Please. Don't tell me you're one of those puppy believers. But I have to tell you that, 'cause I am. But how can you believe in them if you've never seen 'em?

 We've never seen lots of cute things that probably exist, like Stuhven's legs. I do have handsome calves. I may not be sold on puppies, but I believe in you, Gluko. Let's go grab us a prime puppy viewing spot. Welcome, citizens of Townopolis. Tonight, may we all be showered with infinite canine cuteness. Puppies! Puppies! Puppies! Yeah. Let's get our puppy on! But first, I'd like to introduce our guest of honor, puppy expert, Penelope Pitt-Plebop. It's really her. I'm picking up high levels of canine activity. Quick! Let the countdown begin. Five, four, three, two, one... puppies! Dear. Um, it's okay. N-Nobody panic. Um, m-m-maybe they're just late. How convenient. Why aren't the puppies showering? I hate to say it, but what if Stuhven's right? What if puppies don't exist? Shut your garbage mouth. I've been studying them my whole life, and I can say without a doubt puppies are real. Maybe they're just off course. No. What if they're in danger? I'm coming, puppies! Aaah! That'll go better next time. Jelly power won't get you into space, but my flying saucer will. To the Space Port. Puppy-rific! Sorry. He's a beauty, isn't he? Bye-bye. Still don't see any puppies. I was getting strong readings before. They can't be that far off course. We need stronger bait. Puppy Num-Nums. Hey, let me have some of those. Sorry, Space Crab, These space treats are for the space puppies we're look-erating for. Have you seen any? Give me one of those Num-Nums, and I'll tell you. It may say "Puppy" on the box, but those Num-Nums are good enough for me. Puppy Num-Nums! Good enough for space crabs. I'm so glad you like them, but have you seen any space puppies? I saw some puppies run by about an hour ago. Wait! Seriously? You saw actual puppies with your own eyes? You guys were right. Which way did they go, Mr. Space Crab? Couldn't tell you. It was the weirdest thing. I smelled breakfast for a second, and then they were gone. Breakfast! Maybe the puppies were hungering for munchables. To the nearest diner, pronto. Space food! Space greetings. What can I get you boys? We'll have the sp-- Yeah, I'll do the Big Bang BLT and a side of Creamy Cosmic Chowder. Jo? Ho Cho Jo's my twin sister. I'm Ho Cho Flo. Pleased to meet you. You look so much alike. Have you by chance seen a shower of befurried pups anywhere? Man, I wish. Always dreamed of seeing a puppy shower, but a huge order came in about an hour ago, and I've had my nose to the griddle all night cooking up some crispy space bacon. Did you say, "bacon"? I have something very important to show you. Here. According to this ancient text, puppies find space bacon irresistible. Do you know what this means? That space bacon is more delicious-er than regular bacon. Yes. It also means someone must have used the bacon to lure the puppies away from Townopolis. Well, who would do that? Yeah, I'm gonna need another 16 orders of bacon pronto. Now, you want bacon or space bacon? Mr. Sprinkles? What are you doing here? Well, hey, guys. I was--was just, you know... Look, puppies. It's impolite to stare. Hey, watch where you're going. Looks like Mr. Sprinkles and his friends are the ones who lured the puppies away. I should have known. The puppy-kitten feud continues. Still? Over a ball of yarn? If we don't stop them, I'm afraid the kittens will try to imprison the puppies forever. We can't let them get away with that. My eyes have been opened to the wonders of puppies, and the rest of the universe deserves that same chance. We need to get on that kitten ship and free the pups! - Go without me. - What? I'm still waiting for my order. Bacon delivery. Bring it to the scratch post. Down the hall to your right. Hear that, Lennon? Could it be the sweet, sweet cry of cute-ified, befurried pups? It's coming from in there. Puppies! They're even cuter than I imagined you imagined them. Yeah, we have to free them. Run, puppies! Run! What are they waiting for? Hey, fluffy dudes, I don't want to alarm you, but you've been captured by mean wittle kittens. They're not getting it. We'll have to speak a language they understand. Bacon! Bacon? About that. Sorry. Hey, wait a minute. You're imposters. Now what are we gonna do? Penelope? Would you believe they messed up my order? I got no L, no T, just a bag of B. Puppies. Bacon! Come on! We've got to get these puppies back in orbit. Come on! Stop those guys! To the spaceship! Space bacon deployed. They're following us. - Yeah! Yeah! - Whoo hoo! Still no puppies? I feel so alone in the universe. Quick! Somebody hug me! Okay, that's cool. I-I'll just hug myself. Dude, these puppy ears are a lie. I want my money back. No, no, no, wait. We can't just give up. If we miss them, we might never get another chance in our lifetime. It's time for you two to go home. I can take it from here. W-Wait. You're not coming back to Townopolis? Thanks to you two, I've finally found what I've been looking for all these years. My home is with the pups. I'll miss you forever. Yay! Whoo hoo! Hey! Sorry, Crab. Got any more of those Num-Nums? Puppy Num-Nums! Mop on some sauce. Throw on some pineapple. It's not a true Hawaiian pizza until you add a volcano. And gummi bears. Gotta bring all the flavors. Here you go, guys. I know you love to cuddle. I declare this pizza to be the world's largest. Wow! It's glorious. What should we call it? I will now name you after my best friend. Therefore, you will henceforth be known as... Glukoha. Actually, my name is Kunu. Nice to eat you. - Wait! He hasn't baked yet. - But-- Trust me. I'm better baked. I'm ready now. It's too heavy. Let me try. Must be all the bowling balls you stuffed in my crust. For extra crunch. Technically, the fourth law of pizza physics states that for proper hoist-to-slice ratio, one must have an equal body of power for every element admitted. Perhaps you could remove some toppings? Stuhven! We can't lose any toppings. My man Gluko needs that flava. Somehow we just need to get strong enough to lift a slice. Who do we know that's super healthy? You want me to train you to lift a pizza? No, bros. Eating lots of pizza is no good for the physique. But it's the world's largest. And it's super heavy. - Heavy? - The heaviest ever. Why didn't you say so? I'm in. I'll do it. But only on one condition, that you both give it 700%. No dancing in the tulips. But I like dancing in the tulips. I don't know about this, Lennon. Plus I'm just all blobby jelly. Let's try, Gluko. - For the pizza. - For the pizza! You ready to get pumped? Yes. I am so ready to get pumped! Chest bump. Welcome to the gym, or as I like to call it, the grunt house. Man, that's a lot of grunting. I don't wanna make that sound. It seems angryful. I've got an idea. Well, looks like I'm buff now. Argh! Yeah? Catch this! So you wanna get buff fast? I like your 'tudes, but this takes time! Okay, but Kunu's probably getting cold. All right, check this out. Terry here has been working on that mountain for days. Watch. Watch in awe. Come on, Terry. Get under that mountain. S'up? Wow. S'up? Did you see that, Lennon? That buff dude totally just made that cute little guy. I wanna make cute little muscle friends that say, "S'up." All right, ready? Let's start you on the atomizer. It always crushes my bloops. Hop on. - Ooh. Ouch! - Ouch! Oof. Ouch. Ha! I'm feeling some jack-tea-fied-ation! I don't know. Getting buff is so tough. Okay, all right. This is not gonna work. You bros are way worse than I thought. Let's start this from the beginning. You wanna flex? Then you gotta be flexible. What, like this? Man, look at that guy go. All right. This is amazing. Yeah. Ha ha! I feel great. This flexersize thing totally works. Yup, totally works. All right, here, bro. Let me help you out. Does that feel good? Think you bros are ready to lift some weights. Weights, bros. Bros, weights. - Yo, bros. - Hi. Now you bros remember, when lifting major poundage, you gotta be each other's spotter. You look out for your friend, no matter what. Just remember, bros. When you wanna get strong, bring your spotter along. Now show me what you got. Lift us, bros. Whoa. Hey, whoa. Easy, man. You don't wanna pull a bloop. Let's try something lighter. We did it! - S'up? - Ha! I totally just made you. Aww. Why are my little guys so little? Hey, not bad, bros. It's a small step. You gotta start somewhere. Train us harder. I wanna make more friends for my little muscle guy. Wow, your sweet attitude is getting me jacked up. Come on, Lennon. Let's get buffical. Ho ho. Check me out. No more blobby jelly. I just love my muscles so much. Hi, muscles. Come on. How come my muscles are so tiny? I lifted like Gluko. Hey, don't do that to yourself, bro, okay? You gave it your all, and you got something to show for it. It's what's on the inside that counts. Mostly. Five me up! We should probably get home to Kunu. No, no, no, no. Not yet, Lennon. I wanna make more muscle friends. Yeah, hey, bro. Hey, bro, wassup? Hey, way to go. Yeah, keep it up. Do five reps of 50 and then three of four, and then 450, okay? Lift that thing. Way to go. Go for the burn. Yes, pain is good. Pain is your friend. Hey, hey, Gia. Back's looking swole. Try a bus now. Yeah. - Kunu. - Bro. Guys, did you forget about me? What? No. We were just-- I'm getting cold. I taste better when I'm warm. I don't wanna go to waste, so I think I'm just gonna have to eat myself. No, Kunu, don't do it. Aloha. It means hello and goodbye, but in this case, it's goodbye. Gluko, come on. Kunu needs our help. No, looks like I have real estate that needs some construction. Ooh, you know what? I'll--I'll catch up with you later, bro. Kunu, stop! I'm here to lift you. Come on, Lennon. You can do it. It's cool, bruddah. I'll just go to waste. Never! I've got more than muscle strength in me. I've got buddy strength. You're getting lifted! Way to go, Lennon. Now eat me. I'm about to say this is a bad situation. 36, 37. Whoo, bro. Bro, a little help, bro. Can't, bro. I'm spotting my boy Terry. Remember, when you wanna get strong... Bring your spotter along. I'm not along with my spotter. Here. Let me help. No! Don't you do it! Don't sacrifice your flava. Never fear. Your spotter's here. - Bro! - Bro! I'm so sorry, bros. Working out is fun, and I love you guys, but I overdid it. Too much of anything can be a bad thing. And when I wanted to get strong, I did not bring my spotter along. Aww. Chest bump? Nah. Hugs. Warm and ready, fellas. I'm starving. You ready to do this? Spot me? You got it, bro. Kunu, you were so delicious. But we may have overdone it. Chirp.
