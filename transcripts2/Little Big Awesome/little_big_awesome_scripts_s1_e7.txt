 - You're so awesome. - You're so awesome. - Ha ha! Both. - Never leave me. Seven, eight... nine, ten. Ready or not, here I come. Found you, Gluko. - Where? - Ha ha. Nice one, Lennon. Okay, your turn to hide. One, two... Three...

 other numbers. This is never gonna work. Shh. Don't blow this for me. And ready or not, here I come. Found you. Told you. Yeah, you did. - Mwah. - Aww, shucks. You know, it's possible that this game would work better if we weren't holding hands. Yeah, but... I need to hold your hand. Can someone say codependent? Why did he call us "cody penment"?

 Does it mean awesome best friends? Well, you know how you gaze lovingly at me while I sleep? That's codependent. But it's so comforting. That way, we're always together. But maybe we shouldn't have to be. Maybe Stuhven's right. We should try to make some new friends. Ooh! Maybe one of them could stare at you for me while you sleep. Hey, wait. Stuhven's our friend, and he lives in your hat. Isn't that coneya penment? Whoa, this is not about me. It's about you. And the word is "codependent." Did you hear that? That's the sound of someone who needs a friend. We have to go to them, Gluko. It's our chance to expand our world. Okay! But we're holding hands. They're not here! Not here. It's not here. There it is again. I think I have something that might help us track that sound. Excuse me, but how is a nose gonna help us track a sound? Hey, look. He's hot on the trail. - Let's go. - Going. Oooh! Cool spacesuit! Aw, man, not you twos. I came here to be alone. Mr. Sprinkles? Is that you? No, it's another cat with an eye patch and bad attitude. Another cranky eye patch cat. You've gotta meet my grandma's kitty, Mr. Sprinkles. I am Mr. Sprinkles, you goons. I was being sarcastics. Now what are you doing here? We heard your yowls, and it sounded like you might need a friend. Apparently we do, too. Why bother? I thought I had friends, but all the cats I've been living with at Grandma's turned out to be aliens sent here to study our culture. They were just pretending to like me. But you guys had such sweet times together. Yeah, I saw a few of them licking your ears. That looked like real friendship to me. He's right. No, he's not. Licking is just how cats take a bath. Those guys were only here to study me, and all I got out of it was this spacesuit they left me. Maybe that was their way of telling you they like you so much and they would love for you to go with them. They'd be totally happy if I did that. So would I. Yeah, right. So you're going, then? No way. Forget those backstabbers. You can just hang out with us, then. We need a third for hide-and-seek. Hard pass. I'll never let myself be suckered in by supposed friends again. Aw, man, you really need a hug. Bring it in. Here, kitty. - No! - You're so slippery. Let me comfort you! I'll think about it, but only if you stop trying to hug me. All right. Deal. I'm so happy. You don't know what you're missing. Come to town with us, Mr. Sprinkles, and let's see if we can't change your mind about friends. Gluko, you should probably let go of me now. We really need to make more friends. Seriously. Townopolis is the perfect place to find friends. - New friend counter. - New friend counter. Yeah, let the friendening begin! You look great in blue. Aww. New friend. Excellent light. That's another friend. Come on, Mr. Sprinkles. Give it a try. What are you looking at? Not a friend. Okay, good first go, but maybe this time, try being less hostile. Kitty in a spacesuit! Mind your business! - Doesn't like babies. - Pfft. Come on, Mr. Sprinkles. You're not even trying. There must be someone around here you might like. I know that dude. He's okay, I guess. Kitty Num-Nums! Then say hi. - Hey. - Kitty Num-Nums. You're doing great, Mr. Sprinkles. Keep going. So, how's it going? Kitty Num-Nums! Enough with the Kitty Num-Nums! Kitty Num-Nums! I don't blame you, Mr. Sprinkles. That dude gets on my nerves, too. - You know what? - No, what?! You taught me a valuable lesson about friendship. Everyone's annoying except my cat friends. And I want to go with them to space and never see any of youse again. We did it! Mr. Sprinkles sort of learned something about friendship. And perhaps we made a new friend? Nope. Gluko and I are gonna prove to you we're your friends by getting you to the cats at the Spaceport. That's so nice. A Triple Friend bonus. Quit hoggin' all the points. That music, it's the other cats. We've been working on that song for weeks. It's called "Cat Planet Polka." We need to get to the Spaceport now. Not in the zero! Go on, Mr. Sprinkles. Talk to your friends. I don't know what to say to 'em. Tell them the truth of your heart. I don't know what the truth of my heart is, except now I feel worse than ever, 'cause I'm too scared to talk to my friends. I should never have listened to youse twos. I just wanted to make some new friends and help Mr. Sprinkles do the same thing. Now everything is ruined. Should we give up and go home for sad naps? I think so. Never! Would I like a sad nap? Yes. Would it feel great? Of course. Do I wish we could get in cozy robes and have cocoa? Obviously! But we never give up. Sometimes you do. Well, not this time. This time, we're gonna fix everything. You stall the Space Cats, and keep them from blasting off while I go convince Sprinkles to talk to them. But that would mean we have to split up. I don't wanna do that. Neither do I, but sometimes you have to do things you don't want to do... for friends. Let's do this. We did it! We separated! Now go stall those cats. My hand's so cold. All right, let's go. We have a launch window to hit. Gotta stop them. Check me out! Hey, we don't have time for this! That does look pretty fun, though. Hold on, let me in there. Whoa, I am loving that echo, echo... echo.... That makes one of us. Just leave me alone so I can yowl in peace. You can still make everything all right. You don't need the perfect words. You just need some words. You really think so? I know so. Now let's work out what you want to say to your friends. Gluko can't stall them forever. Not there! I don't know how much more of this stall-them-forever I can take. Yeah, hey, guys. Mr. Sprinkles! You come here to yell at us again? Never. Y-You're my best friends, even if you didn't tell me about being aliens. I just thought that, you know, since maybe I was gonna, like, miss you a lot and stuff, maybe I could go with youse. Right? Really? You're gonna love it. Well, except for the acid clouds. And the acid lakes. And the eight-foot cockroach tribes. Are they made of acid, too? Of course. Too bad. I'm totally allergic to acid cockroaches. It seems like I can't go with youse after all. But we can't leave you now. You'll be here all alone. Maybe that's okay, as long as I know I have friends out there. And friends here. All right, then. Stand back. They're gone. You can stop pretending to be my friends now. We're not pretending. After our day together, we have very strong emotions for you now. Yeah, whatever. Okay, well, call us if you're down for some hide-and-seek or you just want to hang. Don't hold your breath... new friends. Yes, I got two friends. Make that three. Ha! Let's hold hands and go bananas. Ya heard! Yay! Hey, we're waking down instead of waking up, right, Gluko? Upside-down morning greetings to you, Lennon. You're the best at shaking feet. Ha! Well, you're the best at everything. No. You're the best. Gentlemen, I heard everything you were just saying, and I want you to know, both of you lads are the best of the best! Stuhven's wrong. Only you're the best. Well, if saying you two are the best is wrong, I do not wish to be right. Whoo! Lennon, Lennon Yeah, that's right. I have a secret giant neon sign that says you're the best. Well, I decorated the house in your honor, because you're so great. Well, I've already stocked the fridge with all your favorite food, and I labeled it all with your name, too, so only you get to eat it. Right, fellas? Okay. Stay here being the best while you snuggle these. No. You stay and cuddle this. I don't need adorable animals to prove you're the best. I can show you how much you're the best like this. You rule this much. Well, then I'd have to say you're the best this much. Not fair. Your arms are longer. But wait. That's why you're the best. Or maybe your short, concentrated arms prove that you are. You do realize that you're only doing this because you love each other so much. - 'Cause he's the best! - 'Cause he's the best! Stop using my words to love me. I use these words to love you. There simply must be a way to show that you are both equally the best. Aha! I know! My super computer. I shall crunch the numbers. Data will solve this argument. If you're telling me that I'm better than you, well, that's unforgivable. I can't look at you anymore. You're too wonderful. - I'm leaving. - Me, too. They're gone. Let's get this party started. Yeah, Skate, it's party time. Bring the whole crew. Hey, everybody, Lennon is the most marvelous. How can such a marvelous guy be so wrong about himself being marvelous? I can't believe Gluko can't see how much better he is than me. Like that time he saved me from being licked into a coma. Whoa! No! No! Stop licking me! Hey, wallow in me instead. - He's the best. - He's the best. I don't want to live in a world where I can't talk with Gluko all day. I don't want to live in a world where I can't stare lovingly at Lennon for 23 hours a day. But how can I when we're mad at each other? Unless I wasn't I, because then, I wouldn't be me. What if I wasn't me? I could be friends with Gluko if I was someone else, someone different. The Personality Shop! That's it. I'll get a different personality. Party, party, party, party, party! We lookin' fly. Let's get to Gluko and Lennon's house for that party. What kind of personality should I be? Bossy? Shy? A dude who wears a hat? I look great! I'm not feelin' it. I don't think so. He ain't feelin' it. Ooh, the numbers. The formulae. The mathematics. I need more data. Lennon, bring Gluko. I need more d-- Hey, who turned out the light? Where did the world go? Hello, stranger, I'm, Glendon. I'm a strangely accented astronaut who is not so great. I say, what's your name? I'm, um... Blup... o. Yes, that's my name, Blupo. I'm a heavy metal clown. And--And I'm not that great at all. Shake hands? Yes, splendid. Blupo, I'm looking for a big jelly bloke about your size who has a collection of every lunchbox note his grandmama gave him since preschool. Have you seen him? I don't know anyone by that description. But I happen to be looking for a short guy in a wool pompom hat, has a birthmark shaped like a baby pangolin, man. Have you seen him? No, no, no, no, no, so sorry. But you know, I don't hang out with short guys. Tall chaps like us tend to stick together. Well, maybe we could help each other find our guys. Wouldn't you say that our two lads might be found at the same place? I don't see my guy. And I don't see my chap either. Well, since we're here, might I buy you a hot chocolate? Well, only if I can buy you one. I have often wondered why this town only has one disco skating rink. Dash it all. And the regulations are through the roof. Society, man, you know. Look at this skate. Not to mention the safety suit they make you wear. Hey, you boys mind keeping it down? You're always so loud in here. Why, whatever do you mean? This is my first time here. Come on, Blupo. I know some other places where my friend could be. The dark. The nothingness. Somehow it's making my mind sharper. I cannot see, but I can finally see. Bother. I don't see my friend in here. Yeah, bummer. Me neither. Well, should we maybe just stay and watch a little? Right on. Aw, aw he thinks the pickle is a snake. Jolly good. Ha ha ha. - Whooo! - Whooo! Whoo hoo! Radical! Yippee! I didn't know you played supermarket screamers, old bean. Yeah, blow my mind. I thought only my friend and I knew about it, dude. Party, party, party, party! Well, it's, um-- it's getting kind of late, and I don't have a home. I guess I should buy one. I've got an app, dude. "Teepee & Z's." A home away from home. Blupo, old sport, that was one of the very best days ever. Glendon, we were so rad. We should have our own show, dude. Wow, you know, I didn't see this coming, man, but I think you're my best friend, Glendon. I find myself surprised, too. We haven't known each other very long, and yet you're my best friend, Blupo. Wake up! Sigh. Stuhven, are you okay? At first, I was scared of the darkness, but the darkness helped me to look deeper inside myself. I learned that everything fits together to create infinity. Infinity! I thought I needed all the numbers, and I did, because friendship is infinite. Hey, man, if friendship is infinite, then I won't need to disguise-ify myself anymore. Instead of pretending to not be me so I can be with not you, I can be me and be with you. Gluko? Lennon? Buddy, it's you! Did you disguise yourself in order to hang out with me? You sweetheart. Looks like we both did, you big jelly roll. Aww. Gluko, you're the best this much. And you're the best this much. The circle of friendship. Infinity! Just like Stuhven said. There's only one problem. I'll miss Glendon. Two problems. I'll miss Blupo. Hey, look! You guys can hang out with us any time. You're the best! - No, you're the best. - No, you're the best. It sure is nice to be home. To the peace and quiet. - Whoo! - Yeah! Chirp.
