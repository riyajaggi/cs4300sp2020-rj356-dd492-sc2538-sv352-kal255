 Whoa. That was intense. Ready for our morning routine? Do we have to? Only every morning. [ groaning ] And last, but not least, we make the bed. ♪ And pulling up the covers ♪ - Yeah. - ♪ And tucking in the sheets ♪ ♪ And pulling up the sheets ♪ - Oh, yeah. - ♪ And tucking in the covers ♪ ♪ Place the pillow ♪ ♪ Place, place the pillow ♪ ♪ Place the pillow ♪ - Ahh. [ sad trumpet plays ] All right, I'm ready to be made. [ sighs ] Uh, really? I mean, I already did all that other stuff. Come on. It'll be great. Uh, yeah, you know, I-I'm sorry, Bed. I--I just--I can't right now. I--I got stuff to-- I just don't have it in me. Hey, it won't take long. I promise. [ groans ] But I don't wanna! But I wanna get made! Hey, buddy. What's going on? Oh, uh, my bed wants me to make it, - but I don't want to right now. - Why not? There are tons of reasons to make your bed in the morning. Like what? Well, making your bed gives you somewhere to put all of Grandma's awesome homemade pillows. [ foghorn blows ] And it lets you see if there's anyone hiding in your bed. That's terrifying. Uh, I'll just see you guys later. Heh. Plus, like Grandma always says, [ imitating Grandma ] "Ooh, my little hamantaschen, "you must always make your bed when you get up, [ gruff voice ] or else--else--else--else." She kinda lost the thread on that saying, and it honestly got kinda dark, but it definitely has to do with what to do when getting up. [ gasps ] "Get up," you say? Hmm, that gives me an idea. Loophole. Hah! I never got up, so I don't have to make my bed. Ah, seems a little ridiculous. Oh, does it? What about all the cool stuff we won't be doing while I'm stuck here making the bed? [ gasps ] I never thought about it like that. We could be teaching birds to skateboard right now! [ squawks ] Okay, I am in. Let's get out of here. Surf's up, birdies! Oh, no. Not making the bed could take Gluko down a dark and terrible path. I have to help him. That's cool. I'll just stay home by myself, then. I got stuff to do. Well, mornin', boys. You two look happier than a pig at a birthday party. And that's pretty happy. We're celebrating our freedom! Yeah! I didn't make my bed this morning, and now we have all the free time in the world. High-five! Oh, come on. That's messed up, and I'm not just talking about your bed. If you don't make it, where are you gonna put all your pillows? Oh, maybe we'd better go home and make the bed, Gluko. No, no, no. Stay strong, buddy. We just got to the fun part of procrastinatining. Just smell that hotted chocolate. Mmm. Here's to no consequences for our actions. - Cheers! - Cheers! [ slurps ] [ whispers ] Make me. [ both scream ] Excuse me. Could I, uh-- Could I get a hot chocolate to go? - [ screams ] - The walking bed! Lennon: Run away! Run away fast! - Crawl. Crawl. - Hi, Radish Family. - Crawl, crawl, crawl. - Crawl, crawl, crawl. Hi, Giraffes. Go all-in. [ both yelling ] Bed: Whoa, yeah. [ laughs ] Hey! Come on. It doesn't have to be that big of a deal. Just make me, Gluko. No! You can't make me make you! Gluko, cliff! Ahh! Cliff! Psst. Why not take the stairs? Huh? Running for my life! Running for your life! No more stairs! [ both scream ] [ Gluko groans ] Hey there. Sorry. We never got around to finishing those stairs. The name's Dave. Welcome to Freedomto. Did you say, "Freedomtown"? Freedomto. Freedomtown? Mm-hmm, Freedomto. Mm, it just really sounds like you're saying, "toe," instead of, "town." We just never got around to finishing the na. So, uh, what's this town's deal? - Deal? - Yeah, you know... - [ coughs ] - every mysterious town in the middle of nowhere has a deal. Remember when we found that town where everyone spoke only in hugs? Of course. That's where we became fluent in hug-talk. [ giggles ] You said it, buddy. Well, I guess in Freedomto, our thing is freedom. Here, you'll never do anything you don't want to, and if you get tired of doing something you're doing, just drop it, and move on. Life is too sh. I haven't brushed my teeth since I was a little girl. See? - [ pop ] - Freedom! I haven't combed my hair in decades. Hey, Stuhven. Lyle, is that you? [ laughs ] Yeah, it sure is. I, uh, just haven't hit the gym in a while. Well, I'm running away from the bed I don't wanna make. Hey, well, that's great. I knew you guys were gonna fit right in. Come on. Let me show you arou. [ coughs ] Everything here seems, uh, kinda half-finished. Oh, for sure, brother. It's like I always say, if something's worth doing, it's worth only half-doing. - I don't get it. - [ laughs ] Well, allow me to educate you, my friend. A banjo's just a half-finished guitar. [ playing banjo ] ♪ In life, we all have things to do ♪ ♪ That we really don't want to ♪ ♪ But come on, son, don't be a hater ♪ ♪ That old chore can get done later ♪ ♪ When we go and throw the disk ♪ ♪ We found a way that has no risk ♪ ♪ Quit before the game begins ♪ ♪ Without a loser, we all win ♪ ♪ Half a song is better ♪ [ fading out ] ♪ than one that's ♪ ♪ Come and see our railway car ♪ ♪ Doesn't need to go too far ♪ ♪ Conductor's busy, that's just fine ♪ ♪ Sitting here, it's always on time ♪ ♪ Yes, everything you'll see today ♪ ♪ Is halfway done, and that's okay ♪ ♪ In Freedomto, if it takes too long ♪ ♪ Leave it half-finished ♪ ♪ Just like this ♪ Is that the end of the song? Nah, man, but it's cool. We can finish it later. Okay. Well, hey, thanks for everything, but I think it's about time we headed home now. No can do, brother. We never finished building the road out of town. [ bird squawks ] It's cool, though. There's so much more here for me to. Super nice guy. Gluko, I think this place might not be as cool as Dave says. What? Didn't you hear the song? This place is great. We never have to do anything we don't want to ever again. Come on. I'm getting hungrified. Let's grab a sandwich. Good day, sir. I'll take one cheese sandwich, please. Where's the rest of the sandwich? [ sighs ] I'll make it later. See? This place is messed up. It's okay. I'm just a little very extremely hungrilicious, not a big deal. What I really need to do is sit down and collect my thoughts. [ yelps, groans ] Someday someone will finish putting me together. [ screaming ] Wait! Gluko, come back! Nothing's finished. It won't drive. Ahh! They're not open. [ screaming echoes ] [ townsfolk laughing ] Oh, Lennon, I thought if I didn't make my bed, I'd have more time to do cool stuff, but now we're stuck here forever, and it's all my fault. Don't worry, Gluko. It'll be okay as long as we're stuck here together. I'm just sorry there's so many things we're going to leave unfinished back home. Oh, I'll never finish helping Grandma dig that bottomless pit. Grandma: Hello? And we'll never finish running those numbers for Mike in accounting. Come on, Gluko and Lennon. I need those numbers. - [ telephone rings ] - Oh! And worst of all, I'll never finish making my wonderful bed. [ crying ] I let you down. [ whispers ] Hey, guys. - [ screams ] - Whoa, hey, hey, hey, hey. Don't cause a scene. Bed! I'm so glad to see you. Ah, thank goodness you're okay, Gluko. I tried to warn you about where not making your bed could lead, but-- Shh. So much is said in silence. I'm sorry, Bed. You were right. I see now that a chore isn't a chore when you're taking care of the people you care about. I should have done this a long time ago. Oh, yeah. That is good. Hey, that guy finished something-- [ echoes ] finished something-- finished something. - Let's get out of here! - [ horse neighs ] [ both laughing ] Now they're escaping? They're doing things all the way! - Get them! - [ yelling ] Whew! That's too much effort. - Yay! - Whoo! [ screaming ] [ engine revs ] [ crickets chirping ] Man, that was a crazy day. Maybe tomorrow, though, we can take care of business before we can go out to play. Sounds cool to me. Ah, laying down. Gluko, what are you doing? Oh, I'm just gonna sleep on the floor, Bed. I don't wanna ruin your freshly made covers. But the reason you make your bed in the morning is so you can unmake it at night. Get in here, you big lug. Oh, my. The sheets are so crisp. [ sighs ] I love you, Bed. And also Lennon. - I love you, Gluko. - I love you, Gluko. - [ owl hoots ] - [ snoring ] Guys, they're asleep. ♪ There are animals in the room ♪ Well, what do you think? Looks just like me! Why, thank you. I have been told I am very skilled with a brush. Plus my jelly makes the greatestest paint. [ crowd cheering ] Hey, check out the action over there. Let me guess. You boys are checking out that guy who's got a little version of himself on his head, aren't you? That is so cool. It's almost like Stuhven, but different. Oh, I am nothing like that. Maybe not, but that guy looks crazy interesting! Yeah, no one else I know has a tiny version of themselves on their head. I have so much interestingnessess for that guy. Ho Cho Jo is gonna let you boys in on a little secret. That guy isn't necessarily interesting. Really? That's just a gimmick, a thing he uses to make himself look interesting, because he's actually a big old bore. - That can't be true. - False! Hey, you! [ crowd quiets ] Are you basically boring and that little version of you is just there as a gimmick so people will think you're interesting? Yes. Before I had Gord here, I used to bore people out of their minds. My real interest is the different kinds of vanilla. [ whispers ] Chocolate is better. This little guy's winning me over. I love your little you. Are you free this weekend? I'm having a cake party, and I would love to introduce you and your little mini to all my friends. O.M.Grr, are you free tomorrow? I'm having a game night! This never used to happen. You'll have to excuse us, everyone. We belong to an exclusive club for interesting people, and we're late for a meeting. [ crowd groans ] [ together ] We wanna come! We said the same thing! We did it again! That's a pretty good gimmick. You need a gimmick to get into the club, but I'm sure you could do that, and you'd be just fine. Oh, no way we could keep that up. No way we could keep that-- [ gasps ] See? That's too bad, because there's gonna be a real cool dance party after the meeting. We gotta go. Ooh, I love dance partying. Me, too. Plus he said it was going to be real cool, and that sounds cool. We need a gimmick fast so we can go. Can't we just do what Mard's doing? Sure. Why not? Hmm. [ gasps ] Maybe Stuhven would be willing to dress like me and pretend to be a little mini like Gord. Hey, Stuhven... do you think you could-- No. First, I squeezen into the jelly printer, add photo, press print... and voy-lah. I found a picture! It's my thumb. Little minis! [ together ] I'm good with that. [ both laugh ] High-five! So all we need now is for you two little minis to hop on our shoulders or heads or something, then stroll around town with us. Yeah, well, uh, we were kinda thinking that we'd form a garage band and jam instead. [ rock music plays ] That's valid. I guess we could be in a band, and that could be our gimmick? Mm, yeah, uh... we thought we'd be a duo. Pssh. That's--That's cool. We got a lot going on right now anyhow also for us, so this kinda is perfect. It's kind of a dream scenario. [ plays note ] Hey, really sorry about this, but... Um, we kinda wanna jam, and our songs haven't been, like, field-testeded yet, so... You want us to leave? - [ shouting ] - Both: Huh? Crowd: Ooh! [ whistles ] Walking a giraffe, that's a perfect gimmick! Why didn't we think of that? Let's get a giraffe! There are some excellent examples of giraffeosity here today. [ gasps ] ♪ Mega Giraffe ♪ [ together ] Mega Giraffe. We'll take it! ♪ Wow ♪ [ crowd murmurs ] Is he angerating at us? Maybe we should... ride! Oi! I'm gonna chase you. [ both gasp ] Hey, got you now! Got the apple. Ha ha! Five points for me. Giraffe pellet! Ha ha! Another five. Bonus stage. - [ both gasp ] - Oh! Oi! Now I got you! [ both gasp ] [ Western movie music playing ] [ gasps ] Uh, sorry to bother you, but, um, why are you chasing us? You're trying to steal my gimmick. Steal, or share? Steal. It's not a gimmick if someone else is doing it. I'm the Giraffe Guy around here. [ sighs ] He's right. We can't just steal other people's gimmicks. I guess you can go now, Mega Giraffe. Cool. [ neighs ] So I guess we awkwardly walk away, but in the same direction for a little while. - Ah! - Yah! [ sighs ] We need our own gimmicks. Those other guys were just walking around with something, so I'll walk around with, um... our toaster! Wow! You thought that up so quickly. I'm gonna see if I could thunk up something quick, too. All right, gotta think. Thinking. Nope, I got nothing. Hey, take as long as you need, buddy. You know what? I might need to-- - Don't say it! - I'm sorry! But I can't think of something when you're around distracting me by being so awesome. I might need to be... [ echoes ] a-a-lone. Nope, nope, sorry. Mm-mmm, not worth it. What a great gang of fascinating chums. [ together ] Who?! Well, the people with gimmicks, of course, so interesting. This club is the best. Maybe we could just take a little look? [ laughs ] Good luck. No one gets by Derby. Yeah, nobody. Gimmick? Uh, we're identical twins that look nothing alike. That's impossible. Are you guys trying to squeak by, because you couldn't figure out a gimmick? Well, what's your gimmick? Oh, it's obvious, isn't it? I'm a derby hat named Derby who wears a derby. I would have thought being a doorman was your gimmick. No way. That, well, that's my passion, which also means there is zero chance of you guys getting in here without a gimmick, - so leg it. - Never! Me and my best friend will not be moved! - That's right. - [ cracks knuckles ] It's our choice... to move to the side. - [ sighs ] - Ah, sigh. We'll never carry all of our equipment to the people with gimmicks party in time. We're too mini. We'll carry your stuff. Yeah, if you get us into the gimmick party. - Gluko. - Okay. We'll help you either way. I'm very proud of you. Thanks. [ dance music playing ] Oi, didn't you two try to get in here without gimmicks before? But we're roadies... which is our gimmick. Are you sure? Yeah, think about it. Those guys are mini versions of us, and we're their roadies. It's crazy unique. Eh, well, this better be a real gimmick and not a passion or something. No, no, no, no way. Just a gimmick. We're still working on our passions. [ grunts ] I like those blokes. They've got pluck. [ guitar feedback squealing ] [ coughs ] Everyone's just standing around. This isn't very interesting. Yeah, they must be so focused on their gimmicks that they forgot how to hang out with each other. All right! Let's get this party started! One, two, three, four! ♪ I used to think that I was fine ♪ ♪ Not the greatest, but basically fine ♪ ♪ But someone said, "Hey, you're a bore ♪ ♪ And you gotta get something more" ♪ ♪ I searched over this whole land ♪ ♪ And finally I understand ♪ ♪ Everyone's a critic unless you got a gimmick ♪ ♪ Don't be a mimic ♪ ♪ You gotta get a gimmick, get a gimmick ♪ - ♪ Get a gimmick... ♪ - Whoa!

They have so much passion for their music. Well, sure, but you have Gord. It's true, but Gord's my gimmick. I don't have a passion for him. - [ Mega Giraffe neighs ] - Hurtful! [ elephant trumpets ] Is it weird that I don't feel like I need a gimmick anymore? Yeah, no, me neither. I figured out my passion, though, doing cool stuff with you. Ah, me too, buddy. Guitar me! [ song resumes ] Chirp.
