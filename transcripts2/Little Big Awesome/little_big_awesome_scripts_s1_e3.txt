 - You're so awesome. - You're so awesome. - Ha ha! Both. - Never leave me. It's so hot today. I bet we could fry an egg. Good idea. I always wanted to see what would happen. Yeah. This feels really good. You don't look so good, though. No. You got sunburnt. I'm all right.

 I'm feeling pretty tender. This is the Sun's fault! Hey, Sun, over here. Okay, listen. I know it's one thing to be hot, but you just burnt my friend. He is a puddle. That wasn't chill. I'm a total chiller. All the time with you people. "It's too hot, too cold. You're giving me horrible burns." No one bothers to carry a parasol or wear sunscreen anymore. I'm offended!

 Sorry if you were offended. If I was offended? Well, of course I'm offended! I said I'm sorry. Well, I'm sorry that saying sorry isn't a magic word. Your apology is half baked. Well, if you hadn't fully baked my friend, I wouldn't even have had to apologize. Ha! I knew it. You aren't really sorry at all. I'm sick of being treated like this. I'm outtie. Dude, the Sun is gone! Like, run for your lives before we all bump. Is it just me, and maybe I'm wrong here, but did Mr. Sun seem angry? Nah, he has zero reason to be angry. Yeah, unless your apology was half baked. I don't think so. I'm gonna entertain the thought, 'cause you're my best friend. Nope. See, the thing is I'm a nice guy. I try to do the right thing, and I'm pretty sure I'm just doing it again. Well, there's nothing we can do about it now. We'll see Mr. Sun tomorrow, and we can straighten this out. Either way, it's nighttime, and we should probably be home in our PJs. I mean, I guess it's night, even though it was just morning. Whoa. Cricket. What was that? Was it a bug? Hey, guys. Help! It's-- It's not nice-looking. Go away, please, Mr. Scary bug, as far as possible. "Go away"? "Not nice-looking"? Really? I was supposed to be asleep, but now it's suddenly nighttime, so I had to come out, and now I have to deal with this? Not cool, man. Yeah, but you're a scary-looking bug. I'm scared of bugs. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Here we go. I know you're scared, Gluko, but you probably hurt this guy's feelings when you called him scary-looking. Whoa. What have I done?! I'm so sorry. Please, give me a chance to explain. I don't know. You were pretty harsh. Please, let me get you a hot chocolate and talk this out, okay? Hot chocolate. Nice. A hot beverage. That would be very soothing. So soothing. Nice apology, Gluko, and tasty hot chocolate's really gonna help smooth things over. You and I are great at apologies. To Hot Chocolate Jo's! Watch your step. Is there a problem? Not at all. Eww. Eww. Eww. Where is everyone? Do you think they all went to the same winter sports competition? No, because I shred on the luge, and they definitely would have invited us. But I can't even think about that now. Let's get all hotted up with chocolate. Hot Chocolate Jo's is closed? Why? Why, Jo? Why? Sorry, boys. It's a blackout. Everyone's gonna have to go home, sit on their couches, and remain motionless, or they're gonna bump into things. People are gonna bump into things? It's happening! This will be the night they call the Great Bumpenin'. Just my cricket luck. Invite me to hot chocolate on the night of the Great Bumpening. Is this what counts as a decent apology to you? I bumped. Did you hear that? That's on you. It's not your fault that Jo's is closed. Is he maybe... not nice? Lennon. Watch your language. It can't be that. Cricket probably got his taste buds all ready for hot chocolate. Poor little guy. Don't worry, Gluko. We'll get Hot Chocolate Jo's power back on, and then you can find Cricket and make this right. Hey, let's go to the Mayor. He can tell us how this happened and what we can do to fix it. Well, I don't know how this happened, and I have no idea how to fix it. I want to help you guys. I want to help everyone, but since the town is solar powered and the Sun has gone missing, the whole town is out of electricity. I feel like I'm letting everyone down. If only I knew why the Sun left. If only anyone knew. Do you guys know? No, they left without saying goodbye. You owe me an apology! Whoa! It's the Bumpening. I mean, the Sun must not have realized that I'm really good at apologizing. If we explain this to Sun, maybe he'll see that he was wrong and come back to his spot in the sky. Let's search high and low. High! Hey, you interrupted my workout. And before you ask, yes, all hamsters work out in clouds. Mr. Sun's not up here! Again? You know, is it possible that you can walk any louder? Did you hear that? I think that was coming from underground. Maybe it's the Sun. Time to search low! Look, just what we needed, a hole in our roof. - Thank you a lot. - You're welcome. Hey, don't pay any attention to him, okay? He's irritated about the clocks. That's right. Radishes have enough chemical energy to power a clock. I thought only potahtoes could do that. Hey, Stuhven, not cool. - My bad. - Since the blackout, we've had to plug our clocks into ourselves or we won't be able to tell the time. It's a real situation. It's really itchy, and it is stressing me out. Hey, quit complaining. That is offensive, and I demand an apology. Well, I'm sorry if you're offended. If? I just told you I'm offended. That's the same conversation I had with Mr. Sun. I think Mr. Sun had a right to complain, too. It wasn't his fault Gluko got burned. I was just mad you got hurt. Aw, it's okay. I'm betterful now. And I told Mr. Sun he wasn't chill, but that was truly the unchillest thing to do. I've learned something today. Good for you. So glad our argument taught you a lesson. It is good. Gluko, we've got to keep looking. Another hole in the ceiling? You guys owe us an apology! We forgot. There's someone that always knows where to find the Sun. Who's that? His coworker, the Moon. Hi, Moon. It's you guys. You're the ones who made the Sun mad. Now I gotta work a double shift. It was my fault. I apologized, but I need a do-over. It was a low-quality apology. Do you know where we can find the Sun? I don't know. Are you really sorry? He really means it. Well, in that case. The theater. Look! It's lit up. Mr. Sun must be in there. We're sorry. My popcorn! Mr. Sun, I didn't take responsibility before for saying that you burnt Gluko, and I'm sorry. You keep us warm and also give us light. Every day, you work so hard. So, Mr. Sun, please, will you accept this fully baked apology? That was beautiful. An apology for the ages. You are so good at apologizing. We're sorry about the popcorn, too. It might still be good. Five second rule. I have germs. I'm sorry, too. I snapped at you guys, but you aren't the only ones that take me for granted. It happens all the time. That's why I love coming here. I can take a break from shining, because the projector does all the work. Exactly. I do all the work around here. You complain about that? Try having hard kernels exploding in your head all day. Dudes, I am so sorry. Hey, do you like hot chocolate? Cricket? Thanks for accepting my apology. I apologize for not accepting it earlier. Gentlemen, big news. We almost broke the record for apologies today with 99 apologies. Just one more would be a new world record. Sorry. Yay! Yay! Yeah! Hey, Lennon. Ha ha! You taste like grape jelly today, Gluko. Yummy! Man, you had to mention grape jelly. Now I want toast so bad. Breakfast! Come on, let's go ask your grandma if she's hungry, too. To Grandma's house! I love this part. Gluko and not Gluko. Hello, my little kugels. Muah. Aww, ha ha! You're looking... very round today, Gluko's grandma. Yes. I can roll. I can roll over here. I also go here. Yes! I can roll over here. I no roll there. The floorboard give me the stink-eye. Who could blame you? So Gluko's grandma, we're going to get some breakfast. Bring you back anything? No! I bring you breakfast. Do we have to eat this? Dude, don't be rude. Just eat the fish. Eahhh! It's like my mouth is having a nightmare. We should have been rude. Delicious, Grandma. The kittens are coming. Aww. Slow down. No, that plate. Hey, careful, guys. No. From the wall? No, the silverware. No, put that down. Get. Get. No! Grandma's pyramid. Those are some bad dudes. I can't believe your grandma keeps them around. They're trashing the place. That's just how kittens play. At least that's what they told me. These kittens are taking advantage of Grandma, and I'm gonna tell her. Whoa, whoa, whoa. You better tell your friend here to back off, Gluko. Hey, Mr. Sprinkles. Don't worry about Lennon. He's cool. He just thinks you're taking advantage of Grandma. Y-You're not, right? There's no advantage being taken here, just fun times. Of course, if we don't get some fresh food around here, that fun might end. See? He just threatened Grandma if he doesn't get food. Whoa, nobody threatened nothing. Or did I? Yes. No. Maybe? Look, it's all good here. Just give me and the boys some Kitty Num-Nums. Kitty Num-Nums. Pronto. Meow. Those kittens don't play. We better get their food fast. Blehh! But first, let's brush that nasty fish breakfast out of our mouths. Oral hygiene! I can still taste the breakfast fish. More toothpaste. No. Hey, hey. - Hey, how are you? - Hello. - Hi. - Hey, have you lost weight? Wait for me. Cutest thing I've ever seen. Three, two, one. Launch! Wait up, guys. Wait up. That's not cute anymore. It's so sad. This is really bumming me out. I can't stop crying. I'm a stranger in a strange land, and I don't know how to get home to Bubble Land. His tears are making me have the feels. We need to help him. How 'bout this, Little Bubble? I promise we'll get you to your home if you stop crying. Okay. I just said we'd get you home. Why are you still crying? 'Cause now I can't stop crying until the jelly guy stops crying. How 'bout you both stop crying at the same time? And... done. Blow. Now you blow. Whoa! Little Bubble! New plan. Take Little Bubble home. Then get Grandma some Kitty Num-Nums. Kitty Num-Nums. Are you sure this path is the best environment for a bubble? He'll be fine. Just don't touch anything, okay, L.B.? I won't. Besides, I know whatever happens, you two will protect me. Right?! I mean, right? 'Cause if you didn't, I might cry. Right, okay, whoa, whoa, whoa. No need for the waterworks. We'll protect you. I'm so happy, I could hug a cactus. No! - A witch's hat. - Hug it! - A pineapple. - Hug it! - An artichoke. - Hug it! - A pyramid. - Hug it! We made it. Ouch! I told you we'd be okay. Yowtch! But let me ask you, is it just me, or is there something weird about Little Bubble? Well, he is a talking bubble, but besides that, he seems fine to me. What are you guys talking about? Just the route. We're kind of lost. No, we're not. We're here. Welcome to Bubble Land. That's right, Bubble Land. Gluko and Lennon got your boy home safely? A-a-Are you sure this is the way home? Yes! Come on! Here we are! Okay, then, we're just gonna take off now. Come on, dude. I'm afraid that won't be possible. You work for me now. Ha ha ha ha! You're going to brush for me, and you're not going to stop. The bubbles you create will build me an army that no one can stand against! Ha ha ha. Look, we'd love to help you build an army, but we have to get home to save Gluko's grandma with some Kitty Num-Nums. - Kitty Num-Nums. - Will you stop that? So sorry. - Ha ha ha! - Wha--! You've all made me very unhappy! Work harder! What are we gonna do, Lennon? When L.B. brings the tears, I can't say no. We have no defense against his evil crying power. Wait! Yes, we do. Remember in the bathroom when you made Little Bubble cry? Your sweet, sweet tears of kindness fought his gross tears of evil. Bubbles, too long have we toiled under the oppressive fist of Little Bubble. We must fight back with our own tears of goodness. He can't resist them. Now cry, cry like the wind! Please let us go, Little Bubble. Never! We need more tears of goodness. Let's get some crazy emotional videos up in here. Little Bubble is near breaking. We need you, Gluko. Why haven't you started crying yet? I can't. I'm too proud of you. That is so sweet. You'll never break me. Gluko, think of your grandma. Think about those kittens. Think about those kittens maybe eating your grandma or, at the very least, being rude to her. Rude? But she's so sensitive. Fine, you can all go home. Hooray! We did it! Whoa! Ha ha. Now let's get home quick with the Kitty Num-Nums. Kitty Num-Nums. We got the Kitty Num-Nums! Kitty Num-Nums. Shower time. Stop! We got the food. Not too bad, you guys. In fact, why don't you have a bite to eat, too? I can't believe those kittens made us eat that nightmare fish again. Hello, nice people. I am lost. Will you help me find my home? Really, Little Bubble? Come on. Chirp.
