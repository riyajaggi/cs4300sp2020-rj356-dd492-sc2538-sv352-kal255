Arthur Machen Emma! Emma! Emma! Emma! Hello? Good evening. Home Security Service. Your alarm went off at 04:21.

 Standard procedure call. Who is this? Camille. Okay. You live at 13 Harpoon Road? Was there a break-in? No. Good. Are you alone in the house? Now, yes. I think. Are you feeling safe? I'm not sure. Okay. Here is what we're going to do, Camille. We will call the police, and I'll stay on until they arrive. Are all the doors closed? Not the living room's. Then go there and lock the door.

 Really? Yes, it would be better. Are you there? Okay. I've done it. Okay. Now turn around. Why? To check the living room. You never know. No one's there. Look more carefully. I'm right here. In the corner. Can you see me? I'm here. Right here. I hit my head. - Sleepwalkers? - No. - Alzheimer? - No. - No signs? - None at all. The old bat did this. But how? Like a guru in a sect, she drugged them. - What with? - The kind of drug that does that, that makes people crazy. No drug can do that. Who is that guy? Hello. Hello. Inspector Ronan. Cool. I'm coming over. There are inspectors in Elden? - For real? - For real. Actually, no. I work in town. But when I heard Emma Larsimon was in trouble, I couldn't help myself. I came right over. Emma Larsimon. Sorry. Lots of people must go on like this. No, few people actually go on like this. I promise I won't bother you. I'm no groupie. I'm just here for work. In fact... Any questions? Shouldn't you ask them? They filled me in while I drove over. But I have hands-free. I'm careful. So? You'll issue a warrant? A warrant? - Why would I do that? - To search the Daugerons' house. What for? For clues. She threatened my parents. - It's not a crime. - She drugged them. According to you. Your parents walked into the woods of their own accord. I know, it's strange. They're consenting adults. It's not enough for a search. What is that? Didn't we take that down yesterday? Caroline Daugeron brought a similar one. - It looks like the ones in your books. - It's exactly like in my books. I told you, the old hag is obsessed. She calls here at night. I have a question. But it's quite embarrassing. - You don't say. - Mostly for me. Okay then. Do you think it might be possible for you to sign these? Aren't you here for work? I said it was embarrassing. I'm embarrassed. Okay, Inspector. Here is the deal. I'll sign your books if you question Daugeron. Yes, but no. - I can't do that. - I'm not talking about a lousy signature. I'll write something personal. Even better. I'll write you a note. It's a deal. I will bring her in. But while I locate your parents, you stay safely inside the house. Deal? Do you still see her? All good. She's gone. The cop did his job. Now us. Let's go. Let's go where? We're in someone's driveway. Exactly. Hurry up. What are we doing? A break-in. - Are you nuts? - Come on. Damn it. Stop it. See, it's locked. Damn it, Emma. Stop. She drugged my parents, and I swear I'll find out how. It's useless. We can't climb this. Sure we can. We do it parkour style. No! Are you okay? I messed up my elbow. Enough of this crap. You can't get over this, okay? - You give me a boost. - What? Get down, and I'll climb on your back. You're out of your mind. Move over. Go on. Sure you can hold out? - Do it! - Okay. What are you doing? - Just swing your leg. - Easy to say from your position. Wait, wait! Are you okay? Emma? Are you all right? Yes, all good. I'm in. Okay. My turn now. Go to the front door. I'll let you in from the inside. You mean I'm going to stand out front like an idiot? Don't stand out front, walk around a bit, like nothing's going on, you know. I don't believe this shit. Okay... Break-in. CHAPTER 3 THE BREAK-IN IN CHAINS THE EARTH SCREAMED Okay. Open up! Fuck. Here we are. No big deal. Okay, but it's illegal. You found something odd? Yes, I did. A door. Where did you get it? There might also be a key. - You hear that? - Yes. There's something moving. It smells worse than elsewhere. It's coming from there. - Let's break it down. - On three. One... Two... Do you want a key? You want to see inside? There's nothing. Only my cats and my teeth. - You didn't take off your shoes. - Where are my parents? In the shadows rotting with their teeth chattering. I'll go freshen up. Make yourselves at home. - What is she doing? - I don't know. - What do we do? - I don't know. Look. There are two cats on my floor. What will I do with them? Eat them? What are you doing? I'm hurting myself. I don't fucking believe it. What will people say when they find out you broke into my house just to hurt me? - Stop it, crazy old hag! - I will if you write. I don't ask for much. I just want you to write. Lizzie... and Marianne... once more. Then everything will be fine for you... for your parents, for me. It will all be fine! If you refuse, I will come back to see you. When you sleep... every night... I will be there with you! Darling Inspector Samuel, I have two words for you: Get moving! Instead of reading teen girl literature, do your job. Find my parents. I will dedicate to you my next real book, meant for grown-ups. Meanwhile, you're my Lizzie. You're my savior. Wake up. Hey, Pat. Sam! You're here for a session? Oh, no. I work in the real world now. So do I. Excuse me, sir? What is this monkey paw for? You ask for five wishes by bending each finger. But be careful. You will be cursed. Cursed how? It turns your wishes against you. Cool. I'll think about it. Think it over carefully. So, a game or a cup of coffee? Just your advice. What is this? Where is it from? It's for work. Do you know what it is? I do indeed. Great. It's witchcraft. Like everything in here. No, not like this stuff. This is dangerous. What do you mean? It's a marker. It makes you vulnerable to spells. Evil spells. How does it work? It's kind of like a Wi-Fi router. To cast a spell on someone, you put it near them. Can you move it? If one pretends to be a witch, for example? Or an actual witch. Please take it out of my shop. No problem. Look, I'm leaving. Thanks, Pat. JAILER OF DEMONS Can I take this one? Won't change a thing. Whoever's connected to this stuff isn't just in trouble. She is cursed. Aurore? Emma? Funny, I was just thinking about you. The wreck kids. It's been a while. Why are you here? To eat my snack. You have a snack? - I do. - Can we share it? Still mad at me? What for? For the lighthouse. It was 15 years ago. Kids' mistakes. Yes, I know. So, are you on a break? That's right. What do you do? I mean... maybe you said it online, but I don't remember. I teach fifth grade. Fuck! Mohawk Aurore teaches fifth grade. At the lighthouse? No. In Azay. The lighthouse school closed. I've just released my latest book, Lizzie Larck. - Have you read it? - No. Sorry. I got them. Haven't read them yet. Are the others still around? Do you see them? I saw Caro's mom. Yesterday. At the church. She asked about you. Said you're the last one to see her alive. We'll all be there. - Where? - At the funeral. Are you coming? What? No, I can't. I have to see my parents. Okay. We'll write each other. Bye, Emma. We're only pushing back a week. Next month, then. I know. I'm aware of that. About London, I totally understand. I'll see what can be done. We'll manage... Camille? Are you here? Oh, no. Okay. I'm dreaming. Everything's fine. Emma. Emma, please. Please. Emma. Please. Write, Emma. Please. Dad, is that you? You have to write. Or she'll inflict pain. On whom? Please write, Emma. Please write. You have to write. I can't. I killed Lizzie Larck. Write! Buried on Monday Marianne born on a Tuesday Happy on a Wednesday Married on a Thursday Witch on a Friday Caught on a Saturday Judged on Sunday Executed on Monday Buried on a Tuesday You see? I came. Just for you. Before Tuesday. Write! Mr. Crow ate too much. Way too fat to fly off. He crashed to the ground. Hugo! Did you kill the bird? I swear I found it like that. You know, Hugo, one day, you too... you'll be like that. You too! You witch! Let's be clear. I'm not gonna trust you because you scare kids, pee yourself, or because I can't sleep. You're just going to give my parents back. Okay? Let's go for a ride. - What? - You're coming with me. Where to? To the reunion. CHAPTER 4 THE REUNION Mrs. Daugeron. You weren't here, so we did the lights ritual. Okay, that's good. Oh, no. Any memories? If I spit in her eye, do you think they'll notice? Emma! I knew you'd be here. Stay there. I'm coming. Hi, Séby. That's it. It's been exactly 15 years and 122 days. You're counting? I subtracted. It's good you came. That you were with Caro's mom. - I fled. - We all do at some point. Better do it as a team. - How have you changed in 15 years? - I became rich and hot. I'd say you're softer. I don't think everyone would agree. Let's do a survey. Aurore said Emma wouldn't be here. Aurore lied. Emma Larsimon is here! We are back together. You made me lie. Sorry. It's cool you came with her mom. It's responsible. What would Caro want us to do today? In your opinion? Cry or down some booze? I say guzzle some booze. It's been a really long time. Not long enough. It's bad. It's a tradition. Little brother, glasses, please. Caro. My Caro. Though we don't get why you did this, you brought us together. And we'll celebrate you in a way you deserve. Which means... drink until the sun sets. You came alone? No. I brought my assistant. - You have an assistant? - Yes, dude. Is she pretty? Have her come. Is she pretty? She is pretty. Welcome, stranger. Thanks. - Some booze? - Excuse me? It's disgusting! It's a tradition! Is Camille pretty? Yes. I think. No worries. She's taken. Why would I worry? Nono is suddenly charming again, right? He's bored. You go through everybody quickly here. Nobody's left. You're here. Dude... God, you're nuts. It's disgusting. And I've known him for 20 years. It's cute how you try to hide it. It's been 20 years! He's my friend. Just like you. Like Caro. That's all. She was wild when she was young. - A punk. - Aurore had the mohawk. But Aurore was nice. She wrote in the school paper. You must read the article on mothers. You still have it? Of course. I always thought I'd blackmail her someday. What are you doing? Put that away. Okay. I get it. No. Nono, don't! I'll send it to you. Damn it, Nono! I'm doing nothing wrong. Taking a pretty girl's number. Camille, I forbid you to read that. I'm your boss. Okay. 06 25 37 42 16. Goddamn it, no! Put that away! And send. Help me, you guys! Come on, guys! Aurore! Promise you won't read it. - I promise. - I was young. Everyone was ashamed of me. Want to be ashamed of me? In exchange, I'll tell you some secrets, okay? See that guy? Oh, no, no. Okay. He's always been secretly in love with me. But he couldn't admit it because the other one was officially with me. We were together. The small one had a boundless admiration for me. Thanks, but it's embarrassing. Everybody loved you. Exactly. But that was before. Although Séby still looks pretty good. I'm sure that deep inside there are still twitching particles, like "why not?" You're boasting? I'm confiding. You're my confidante. Emma? I'm leaving. We only just got here. We've been here for five hours. Time flies when you're having fun. Emma, I'm going. Do you want a ride home? Sophie's taking me. Sophie? My woman. You have one? I have a wife. How come a guy like you has a wife? I'm going, babe. Say you'll stay longer. I'm staying here forever. I'll take you home. You want to see my teenage bedroom. No. Really, I want to take you home. Yeah, right. I know you were in love with me. Everybody knows. There you go. I was as in love as one can be at 12. Don't underestimate your childhood loves, Tonio. At 12 it's the best. Then you break everything. Coming? You need to go home. No. Not yet. The sun's setting. Wow. They have all left? Don't lay a hand on my brother, you Gorgon! He's taking me home. Who's taking you back? Me? I'm staying here. With Caro. With Caro. Rabelais High School paper. June. Emma Larsimon: The burden of having a mother. Our generation's curse is dictated by our elders. Mine lives in my mother's head. For her, the meaning of life resides in the absence of questioning. The heart is big, but it drowns in an ocean of foolishness. We are painting here the portrait of an idiot who'd rather hide her stupidity behind smiles and stuffed tomatoes. - You're here? - I am. - I am here. - Alone? Little Tonio brought me home. He was in love with me. Yes, everybody was. Exactly. He didn't want to come in. He just dropped me off. I think I scare him. I scare people now. Okay, I'm... I'm going to bed. - Sleep it off. - Okay. Emma? Yes? Why did you write that? If my daughter wrote something like that, I... You told me you wouldn't read it. You lied! You're a liar. You are a liar. By Tuesday. Write, Emma, please. Write! Write. Dad, I can't. I killed Lizzie Larck. REBIRTH One doesn't come back to life. Not this way. The earth must scream. It must lose balance. But Harrow Bay never liked balance. Its streets are Satan's church. Its woods a snake pit. Lilian is one of them. Lilian did what the night whispered for him to do. He drowned five calves in cresting waters and hanged five children at the fire towers. Lilian sacrificed children and cattle, offered his body and his soul. So how could Marianne have resisted... with such a lovely invitation? Lilian smiles. Others can now endure suffering and torments. The imbalance is here. The earth is screaming again. So in her casket, Lizzie Larck opens one eye. She's ready to do dead what she did while alive: Hunt down Marianne. Again and again, come what may. And then, only then, can the reunion take place.
