 A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES "And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side, Of my darling, my life and my bride, In her sepulcher there by the sea, In her tomb by the sounding sea." WRITE FUCK YOU WELCOME TO ELDEN [Ronan] I don't know how we're gonna kill this witch, but first I should tell you how I've gotten here. Here's what I noted while I read over the last two nights. I should say re-read.

 They weren't as fun as the first few nights. It's a matter of context. Follow me. Lizzie Larck's first book, Lizzie In Chains, is sold in four European countries. Chapter 16 is titled "Tom Splashes About." It starts like this: [man] Tom is naked, as he often is before he's dressed, and dried off, too. His feet are in the water, his back is out. He's waiting for Mommy. Here she comes running in. "Weird," thinks Tom, shivering. Her smile is too big. So are the large hands that seize him.

 His mother shoves his face into the bathwater. Tom splashes about, trying to breathe. But it hurts when icy water enters his throat. [Ronan] A month after the book's release in France, a mother abandons her car on the Noirmoutier Gois, leaving her 3-year-old son in it. His name was Tom. It might seem like a coincidence, but barely a year later, you release Marianne Bites, translated in 22 countries, including the United States, Japan and Russia. In Chapter 13, one reads: [man] In the mighty white bear's body, Marianne feels at ease when, coming upon Harrow Bay's cross-country team, she rips, tears and chews. [Ronan] After its worldwide release, this occurred in the Novaya Zemlya region of Russia. "A crazed white bear attacked and devoured a local basketball team. The sole survivor, a boy, told rescuers that the bear yelled something. It spoke." The third Lizzie Larck book, The Earth Howled, will add a Korean translation. Chapter 3 has these lines: [man] Tristan is just old enough to make a decision. He waits for everyone to fall asleep, then sneaks into his parents' bed. Plunging his penknife into their throats and teeth, he remains calm, happy. He has protected his sister. From whom, by the way? Yes, from Marianne. [Ronan] That year in Seoul, a boy stabs his sleeping parents to death. It is explained by sleepwalking. Lastly, three days ago, on the Lizzie Larck official website, you wrote: "Lilian did what the night whispered to him to do. He drowned five calves in cresting waters and hanged five children near the fire towers." Over 300,000 people read the post that night. The following night, five children in Elden attempt to... I'm doing this. Listen carefully, Emma Larsimon. You have no more power over this than Mrs. Daugeron as she tortured her husband. You understand? She is a witch. She manipulates. She possesses. She hurts. That's what she does. You're only a tool. Why me? I don't know. What we do know for sure is... you shouldn't write anymore. Ever. [Sébastien] Or the reverse. Why don't you write Marianne's death on the website? Write that she gives my son back, and then kill her. You make her disappear forever. Booyah! Isn't it a bit too easy? You're forgetting... I'll kill the bitch. Why don't you also write that I win the lottery? Or you could end world hunger. No! I know. Turn all firearms into wildflowers! Good idea, right? Hey. We're not talking about Aladdin's lamp. We're talking about a witch ruled by a demon. Don't play on her turf. - What do we have to lose? - Right. - No pain, no gain. - Too few words. - Please note, I firmly oppose this idea. - Noted. Goodbye, Marianne... She's trapped. We bury her alive? Edgar Allan Poe style. She has my son. We dismember her. - We could do this my way. - Meaning? Not playing into the hands of devil worshipers and... [electricity buzzing] Don't worry. It's common. For real? No. Guys? [necks crack] Okay. I'm dreaming. She can't hurt me. [screeching] [caws, screeches] [screams, gasps] Black crows. ...tore her face to shreds. I dozed off? Yes. About two minutes. [Ronan] You literally collapsed on your keyboard. What does doing it your way entail? Hardly a thing. Light bulbs. An animal. And a remote location. Okay. We'll do it, right? - I'm coming with you. - I don't think so. Why not? I have nothing left to lose. Apparently, neither does he. But I must get your kid back. Take care of your other kid and your wife... - who must be freaking out. - What else can I do? [exclaims] If you insist, you can kiss me. What? I'm off to battle. I need strength, courage. - That's worth a French kiss, mister. - No. Okay. Then just a smooch. Emma, no. - Okay. A peck on the cheek. Come on. - Pfft. [chuckles] Bravo. You're a jerk, Larsimon. - Take care of yourself. - Of course. - Nobody's more important than me. - [engine starts] So, obviously I do. - How will you do it? - His way. For the memories? Totally. We went to school there. We took the ferry at the harbor. The school closed after Lucie. Nobody's here now. The lighthouse, it's... Automated? Yes. Within the hour, it becomes an island. No way in or out. Prisoners for the night. Perfect. What are they doing here? Seb told us the plan. We want to contact the dead. You have no reason to go there. She's using my sister. Tonio still isn't back. She has my son. Don't mess with the Shipwreck Kids. [both] Amen. You know who we're contacting? - You know who she is? - We do. This thing will lie. It will get into our heads, hurt us. [all] We know. Cool. Spiritualism. It's been a while. QUAY OF THE DROWNED WATCH FOR THE TIDES Awesome. [door creaking] [lighthouse lens creaking] [Ronan] All right. Let's get to it. I will summon her with her name, her actual name. She won't resist it. She will have to leave the place where she hides in order to come here. She will figure she has a real opportunity to hurt us, to go inside one of us. Then I will force her to speak. She'll tell us where the child is. She won't be able to lie. She can't lie to her name. Then I will summon her. I will trap her inside a body she won't ever be able to escape. - [Aurore] No! - [Emma] What? Well... isn't this the priest's dog? [barking] Aurore, we won't hurt the dog. We'll just put a witch inside him. Okay? He won't even notice. Sit. [Ronan] We trap her inside this body. Then we keep the body away from anyone. We keep it alive. This will be her new prison. A living jail... - Crap. - [chuckles softly] [Sébastien] What is this? Yes, I was once young. I was gullible then. - [Sébastien] That's why. - But they're opposing ideologies. Young people don't know how to believe. Stop acting stupid. Now's the time for a last smoke. We'll start in 15. Okay. [creaking] Did she contact you again? Who, Aurore? What? No. Why Aurore? Sorry. I don't know what you're talking about. I meant the thing. The witch. You spoke to her? Yes. [screaming] How is she? She is evil. Evil? - How? - Really evil. Whenever I imagined something, she did worse. She hurts. That's all she does. So, it's brave to come here, right? All of us here, like the old times. It was cool. Now I don't feel like going. Tell me about it. When all this is over, talk to Aurore. She has something to tell you. [Ronan] It's time! [creaking] Don't mess with them. They're sensitive. To what? There's a thermostat. The temperature shifts during such events. If she's here, they'll go on. I've never felt a shift in temperature. Well, I go with my beliefs, okay? Come sit down. [Aurore clears throat] I feel so old. I don't believe it. [dog whimpers] [Ronan] So... from now on, we all play the game. - Don't be cynical... - [Sébastien] We know. Shall we begin? If you say so. Hold hands and close your eyes. [lighthouse lens creaking] [Ronan exhales sharply] Let's start. CHAPTER 11 SÉANCE [speaking in Latin] [in French] Marianne Basselin, wherever you are, whatever the distance, on command of these words, tear yourself away from your misdeeds. In the name of Adonai, El, the Elohim, Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh, and Zobroth. In the name of St. Dunstan, jailer of demons, whose image protects me. And by the power... [muffled soundscape] [muffled indistinct dialogue] [growling] [door creaking] [normal] I am summoning you. By order of these words, whatever the distance, traverse time and space. Appear in my presence. I summon you. - Come now. - Close your eyes. [Ronan] By Tetragrammaton's almighty name, Jehovah, whose name rules all things in this world and the next. Come. In the name of Adonai Sabbaoth. Do not linger, Adonai Shadai. - [creaking] - [Ronan] Marianne Basselin. Wherever you may be, I summon you. By command of these words, whatever the distance, traverse time and space... - [overlapping incantations] - ...appear in my presence. Marianne Basselin, come right now. Obey my will in Tetragrammaton's almighty name. Jehovah, whose name rules over all things in this world and the next. Show yourself here right now, so I see you face this circle. Marianne Basselin, speak! - [creaking] - Whatever the distance, appear here before me. I summon you. Come right now. [creaking] - Obey my will. - [barking] By Tetragrammaton's almighty name, Jehovah, whose name rules all things in this world and the next. Come. Speak to me plainly, without lies. The king of kings commands it. Marianne Basselin. Speak. Speak. Speak! It's not working. What? I'm sorry. You can open your eyes. It's not working. No. We'll try a bit longer? We've been here quite a while. I mean, this sort of thing requires patience, right? [Ronan] It's not a matter of patience. I gave her orders. I summoned her by her actual name. She won't obey. It's not working. What about my son? I thought you'd help me. Well, I can't. I thought I could, but I can't. She won't obey. I can do nothing. It's like teaching a lion to sit. If it doesn't fear the whip... We're screwed. - I disappointed you. Sorry. - [Emma] This isn't your fight, Samuel. We'll find something else. [Arnaud groaning] Meanwhile, what? We use the sleeping bags. I won't sleep in the same room as the dog. [whines softly] Good boy. Slow down. - [whines softly] - Shh, shh, shh. Here. Let's get settled. [dog whimpering] - [whines softly] - Are you okay, doggie? You feel better? I feel better, too. [sighs] I don't know if it's okay, but I do. I like it when nothing happens. CHAPTER 12 THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY - [Emma] I got to you. - [Aurore] Not at all. - Without saying it. - Stop it. - Shall I drive you back? - You both live here. Stop doing this with your fingers. Stop it or I'm going to... [Emma] Wake up. Please. [monitors beeping] [beeping accelerates] YESTERDAY [alarm wailing] [baby crying] [woman] What's going on? [metal clanging] [gasping] [Philip breathing heavily] [breathing shakily] [Philip breathing heavily] TONIGHT [reggae music playing over headphones] It's nighttime. You should sleep. [Philip gasping] Stop moving. I'm trying to fix this. [monitor beeping rapidly] [Ronan] By the power conferred by knowing your true name... Marianne Basselin, I am commanding and compelling you. [soft roaring] Show your face, servant of evil. Wife of the mighty and awesome Beleth, great king of hell, queen and slave in his bosom, show yourself. You have no choice. I am compelling you with your true name. Marianne Basselin, speak. [Arnaud groaning] [creaking] - [Arnaud] There. - [Aurore clears throat] We're cool here. - Are you sure? - Not at all. I won't sleep where a Satanist's ghost was invoked. And in Latin, to boot. It's creepy here, too. Yes, but here... there's two of us. That's why I'm here? - Obviously. - [laughs] [clears throat] Otherwise... you didn't have anything to tell me? Well... no. Why? Nothing. I just thought you had something to tell me. - [stammering] - No. Like what? - Like... - Yes? I don't know. You're the one who has to tell me. Well, no. I don't know... I'm thinking, but I have nothing special to say. Emma said you did. She's a jerk. Why did she say that? I've got nothing special to say. What would I have to tell you? I don't know. Emma said... Fuck Emma! We haven't seen her in 15 years. What makes her think I have something to say? - Okay. - I mean, seriously! She thinks she can guess things about people. She doesn't know me. Just because we're stuck here doesn't mean it's time to say... Anything at all. - Such as? - Nothing. Honestly. [sighs] How could you sleep with her? [chuckles softly] We were 15. - I don't think we even... - What was it about her? She wasn't special. I had a Mohawk. She did nothing all day. I played music. - Not exactly. - Okay. I never played. But I had a guitar. I don't get why I'm not likable. Less than all the girls you see. How many have you seen? "Seen"? Kissed. Dated, you know. Had sex with. I don't count. Right. Thirty-nine. I'm actually worse than 39 girls? Would I rank 40th, at least? Even for a marathon, 40th sucks. To be behind... What's her name again? With the highlights? - The highlights? - The blond tips. - Vanessa? - Vanessa. [scoffs] I quite liked Vanessa. You quite liked Vanessa? Yes, she was funny. She wasn't. She never made me laugh. - She was nice. - No! Yes, she was. A little bit. - But that's it. - I was in love with her. But not with me? Because I like you. There you go. You're dumb, not funny, you drink, you're unbearable, but I can't help it. Always liked you. Why don't you? I don't not like you. I quite like you. No, you don't. Not the way I like you. Not as I like you as an adult. I care about you. That's where Emma's dumb. It's way better to be in love than not. Since when can't you love someone in secret? And what if I secretly love someone? If I'm okay with it and want to handle it like this? Or maybe I don't want to know. Or I'm afraid to find out. But I could ask you. So, you know what the deal is about me now. What about you? Do you love me? A little bit? Every time we were together, you were waiting for something? What? You... You weren't just the Aurore I could see? You always had something in mind? No. This whole time? Wait. That's silly. I was just normal, and you pretended to be... just a friend? You always had something in mind. The entire time? Aurore, it's ridiculous. Isn't it ridiculous? I'm going to give the dog water. [lighthouse lens creaking] [sucking teeth] [breathing heavily] [squeaking] [shouts] Someone's freed the dog. I'm sorry, kiddo. [lighthouse lens creaking] [Sébastien moans] [Marianne] Samuel! I'm not here. I'm in your hand. Bullshit. [breathing shakily] [door creaking] [yelling] [gasping] Someone freed the dog! - [Emma] What? - [Aurore] The dog was freed! She's here. - [Sébastien] Who's here? - Her! It worked. She came. I saw her right here. - [Arnaud] When? - [Ronan] From the beginning. She's been here all along. She must be one of us now. - Who freed the dog? - I never went outside. [Sébastien] Where were you? With me in the car. The whole time. But you went for the dog. I found the door open. [Ronan] Stop it. It's useless. - [gun clicks] - Whoa, whoa, whoa. I know who freed the dog. I saw it. I did. [creaking] I saw myself do it. I went and freed Quentin. [growling] And then I sat here. A long time. With my eyes, she watched you. She is me. She has taken me. [distorted] And she will become you all. [in normal voice] One by one. [distorted] And one by one... you will die. [creaking] [Ronan] Like me. - No! - Don't! - [shouts] - [gunshot] [screaming] [closing theme playing]
