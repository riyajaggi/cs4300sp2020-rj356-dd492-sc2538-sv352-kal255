 A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES "She let her hands play in the hair of the tragic boy. She was not a little girl heart-broken about him: She was a grown woman smiling at it all, but they were wet-eyed smiles." James Matthew Barrie Come. Lend me your ear. It's time to learn. YOU ARE PUNISHED I'm being punished. May I sit down now?

 Why? Because I peed myself again. Nightmares? No. I drank too much. I know you're joking. I should start to emulate Hemingway. You don't need to drink to write. All great writers are alcoholics, or they're not great. Let me deal with my shame. Leave it. I'll do it. You're late. Thanks, Mom. Tie up your laces. I will. WELCOME TO ELDEN Seriously? It's 10 past already. I had to do a wash. I peed myself. - Nightmare? - Yes. - Hey. - Hey. Running late? Emma peed herself? Who's got a hangover? I must admit I don't even know how I got up this morning. Or how I got into bed. If we get caught, we're dead. We're only dead if the priest catches us. What's wrong with Séby? The priest! Scram! I see you, little shits! Go, fetch! - Run! - Go! Fast! Tell me about last night's nightmare. I might be able to help you. It's always the same. Different dream, but the same thing chases me. Like an entity, or a witch. She inhabits people, the people I love, to hurt me. She has a name? Marianne. At least, she says that's her name. An old lady's name. If it's the same entity and has a name, we can summon it. What do you mean? As in summoning spirits? Exactly. As shamans have for millennia. Victor Hugo used to hold séances. Victor was a loser. That's bullshit. I'm a scientist. Science is important. It explains nature, but not our world's underpinnings. What hides under the surface is for real and it's powerful. As a Catholic, you believe that? I am a Catholic because I believe that. And precisely because I'm Catholic, I have made this. What is it? Spiritualism? Cool. No, it's not "cool." It's not a game. It's a dangerous tool. So, why do you have it? You must understand. It's against nature to contact these things. They hate being disturbed. But one of them is preventing our friend from sleeping. Let's tell her to quit messing with the Wreck Kids. Amen. I'm out. Why are you out? I don't mess with spirits. Spirits don't exist. So, why try it? One, it might be fun to be scared. And two? Two, I'm not sure. It might have a psychological impact. After three months with Nono, I still can't sleep with him. I'd like to sleep with him, but not if we wake up all wet. I'm 15. I'm fed up with wetting the bed. Hi, Emma. Hi, Nana. Hey. Were you eavesdropping? No. I heard that Emma wet the bed. I stopped four years ago. You want Doody's opinion? No! No tickling. You are pretty. Oh, I am thrilled. Thrilled. Thrilled. Your monkey's kind of ugly. You're the ugly one. Find me to get it back. You sister's a jerk. She's seven. She's playing. It's not a monkey! This soup is delicious. Go on. She wants to play with you. Find her, and I'll do the séance. I love you. Okay! Here I come. It doesn't matter what you think, or what you think you believe. For the next hour, no cynicism, teasing or kidding around. - Got it? - We could have used my garage. Forbidden places work best. - Bullshit. - What did I say? Okay. We're breaking into our old school. Sorry, but we're not breaking in. Light, please. Sorry. It slipped. You idiot. All right. Can we make a circle? From now on, nobody talks except when I ask you to. Okay? No cheating. No giggling. Your eyes stay shut. No questions. Don't break the circle till the end, or it could be dangerous. We'll go all the way. Give me your fingers, shut up and close your eyes. With me. Listen. Listen. Listen. Marianne. Marianne. Marianne. Show yourself. I know you can hear us. Marianne, I am asking you... to speak to us... to guide us. Marianne, show yourself. Guide us. Marianne, I am calling you three times. Speak to us. It's an order. - Speak. - Me, speak? Show yourself. Guide us. I call you three times. - Marianne, you have no choice. - Guys... Emma, shut up. I know you are here. Show yourself. Guide us. Speak to me. Marianne... Look! Emma, don't be a jerk. What's wrong? She's here. There's nothing. - Don't be a bitch. - Don't you see that? Right behind Caro. You don't see it? No. I'll shut the door. Don't break the circle before the séance ends! - Nothing's in here. - Not in. Next to it. Here. Do you see? - Emma, stop it. - But, Aurore! You are giving me orders, virgin little witch? You think I'll spell my answer? You'll hang like a bitch. And you... Love your brother better. Soon you won't be able to. You, son of a sow, no child for you. They will all be mine. We'll lick and eat them all, my husband and I. You get crow, toad and cat. And you, little whore, I never leave empty-handed. - Aurore, stop! - Go fuck yourself! All of you! And you, I'm doing this for you. We all are, and you're playing around. - It wasn't me speaking. - Really? Then who said it? Calm down, you guys, okay? It's complicated with these things. I won't calm down! There are no spirits or ghosts. It's her! What were you trying to do? A fucking joke? A set up for your crappy stories? You're a fucking liar! Let's stop fighting. It was just a game. She just terrified us. - No kidding. - She spat in my face! - The bell rang. - I'm not done. Teacher's pet. No smoking in here. Mrs. Dutrait will kill you. You'd tell on me? I'll take you home on the ferry. You just want to talk to my sister. She's still mad? Totally. She even said you're a jerk and a real fuck-up. That's a lot of bad words. She's really mad at you. - She'll get over it. - I doubt it. I'm done. We can go now. Cool. But first... Damn it! No! Find me to get it back. No. I don't feel like playing today. Little bitch. I'm coming, little jerk. You can't play here, little pest. When I catch you, I'll make you eat your parrot, I swear. You better not be in here because it's dangerous. Okay. I saw you. You're a little pest. You got me! You are pretty. No tickling! - The soup is delicious. - Shut the fuck up. Come get your thing back, or I'll smash it. Mine. You're mine. Only mine. Lucie. Look at me. Lucie! Where are you? Tell me you're not in here. Sid residence. Yes. What? Mom? Mom, what's up? Mom? Tell me what's going on! Mom, what happened? What happened? Mom! But how did it happen? How did she do it? We don't know. She was alone. That's my point. Who lets a child play alone in the hallways? Where was the teacher? Nobody noticed anything. She suffocated, can you imagine? Let a child play alone, and this is what happens. You punished her. No. You left her. You left me! I'm sorry, Lucie. I will take everyone. Your parents, your friends. Everyone. Hello, my child. Hello. Larsimon? Yes. All right. You know how to confess? You must ask for forgiveness for your sins. - I have sinned. - Yes, you did. You must confess all your sins, one by one. Starting with turning my church into a fucking nightclub. I was there when Lucie died. I didn't find her in time. I should have. I must tell someone, you know? I must say everything, even if you don't believe me. Can you listen to me? Please? I'm listening. And speak up. I'm deaf in one ear. Marianne... Look at her! You punished her. You smoke, my child? Yes, sometimes. Then smoke. Do you know why every village has a priest? And every town? To keep vigil. To watch out. Because anywhere on Earth, however small, even here in Elden, something may decide to rise up against God. That's why it happened? I provoked God by partying here? You provoked me by doing that. God is not offended easily. No, your problem is much worse than God. The thing you summoned with your friends... is real. And it is evil. Its aim is to offend God and break His rules. If it can do that, its strength is boundless. It will do what it told you. Take your friends Then your parents. Elden itself if it wants to. What do we do? There's no "we" here. Only you. This thing attached itself to you. You have to take it away. - Where to? - Far away. How long for? Do you understand what I mean? If you truly love your friends and want to save them, you have to leave them and go away. How could I? My parents won't let me. Except if you hurt them. You must hurt everyone, Emma. You must earn your exile. Only you can do this. You must organize your own downfall. CHAPTER 10 HER DOWNFALL THE BURDEN OF HAVING A MOTHER Go inside! Go on! She's in here! So, Father, am I unforgivable enough? ELDEN IS SATAN'S CHURCH THE LIGHTHOUSE PRESS Our generation's curse is dictated by our elders. Mine is located in my mother's head. For her, the meaning of life resides in the absence of questioning. Here is the portrait of an idiot who'd rather hide her idiocy behind smiles and stuffed tomatoes. She has to go. I can't handle this. We can't. We may get over it, but right now, at this moment... she has to go. WELCOME TO ELDEN You still have time. Very well. Wait. You'll come back to see us? During holidays and Christmas? Sure. You have anything to say? What do you want? A kiss? I would like a kiss, yes. Why are you so mad at me? It's not aimed at you. Then at whom? Whatever you may think of me, I did what I could, you know. As a mother. Sorry if it wasn't enough. I don't want you to suffer. Saying you're sorry is healing. My bus is leaving soon. Bye, Mom. Move your car. Emma. Why are you on my bus? It hasn't left yet. It will soon. We need to talk. You and I. Alone. There's a driver. I don't care. I'm leaving to flee your stupid morals. I'm not here for that. Why are you here? To tell you I know it's not you. Not me, what? All this, it's not you. All you've done since Lucie... Since the night at school. I don't know why, but it's not you. How do you know? Because I love you, as we all do. "As we all do"? Okay. More than all the others. More than Nono, or anyone. I love you. More. I'm trapped here for a declaration? Pretty awkward. I know. What do you want? Nothing. You'll get that. I know. I just came to say I know who you are. I thought you would appreciate knowing, when you're far away, that I know. How are you feeling? Sad. Okay. You can let me go now. Okay. If that's what you want. Hey, dummy... And now? You'll get off this bus and let me go. I don't want to. I'll come back. When? When I'm famous. From that point on, I wrote everything down. I wrote all of high school. I wrote Marianne. I created Lizzie Larck in order to fight her. I wrote and wrote. That's what she wanted, right? So, she's been here all along. She's been in my head. She used me my whole life. She's not alone. I know. I saw this in my dreams. How do we kill this bitch? Can we even kill something that's already dead? Even with all this. Emma. She took my son. Okay. We'll find a way to crush that bitch.
