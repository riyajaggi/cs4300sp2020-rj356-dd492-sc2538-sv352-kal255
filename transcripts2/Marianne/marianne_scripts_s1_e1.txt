 A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES "Hail, hail! Wilt thou go with us tonight? There will be a merry company in the forest, and I well-nigh promised the Black Man that you would be among us." Nathaniel Hawthorne Emma Larsimon, interrupting a saga like yours as it's taking off, some will say is a rash move, as you well know. Incorrect. Sorry, but I've done 10 years of Lizzie Larck, 10 years of horror. I think I'm entitled to... Mom? Mom, are you here?

 You have to be patient. Mom? Open your filthy mouth. See? That wasn't so hard. You just had to... go through here. Mom, are you okay? My dear Catherine. I'm Caroline, Mom. Everything's okay. Just... I just have to... Right... there.

 There you are. Here. It's for Emma. "Lizzie yells, 'You're not my father, you're Marianne, the witch, and you can't hide from your name.' The laughter of thousands fills the church. The father looks at his daughter. He opens his bathrobe. There are foul-looking mouths sprouting from each joint of his body. 'I'm Marianne, demon's wife, and I'll possess your father forever.' Lizzie shouts the psalm, brandishes the wooden bat marked with the cross. This is her fight, her sacrifice. At that, the world breaks open, releasing a wave of disgusting, crawling horrors. Marianne, the witch, yells out from within the father's body, 'You know I never leave empty-handed. Never!' But Lizzie Larck smiles, because she knows and she can see closing in around her and her enemy the tide of innermost shadows." LIZZIE LARCK AND THE INTIMATE DARKNESS You've just read the end. You asked me to read my favorite part. - Why buy the book? - I couldn't care less. You'll save some of your allowance. Emma Larsimon will answer a few questions. Over there, with the glasses. We get that Marianne and Lizzie are dragged into the shadows at the end. But it's really over? What does it say here? FINAL CHAPTER Lizzie and Marianne have had ten years of my life. I was barely out of high school when Lizzie popped out of my head. It's time to write something else. A real novel, for example. It's not a real ending. It's open-ended. Mrs. Larsimon, when are you marrying Pierre? - No personal questions. - But I'm... Actually, I'll keep doing him a bit longer, and then I'll marry him. I like that better. Could we get back to questions about... You're hiding here. - Aren't you signing? - I need a break. Come on, let's walk. I canceled Lille, Lyon and Montpellier. Mügen is upset. They want you to do London. No, not London. You have to go. You said you would. Did you get what I asked for? That's what I'm talking about. Okay. I'll do London. - It's the responsible thing to do. - If you go out with me tonight. What? No. After the signing, I'm done. Right. You're done. Go home, pick out a pretty dress and come out with me. I'm exhausted. I've been working two weeks non-stop. I'm tired. I need to sleep. Okay, then. What are you doing? Asking if Rachelle wants to go out. Why? Because she's my agent. I work for your agent. Don't you want to become an agent yourself? I'd rather go with you, but since you don't want to... - Is this emotional blackmail? - No, it's professional blackmail. Okay. - Just one drink. - Girls' night out. - You're not too old for that? - First, you sign. It won't take that long. Next. There you go. There you go. Here you are. Next? Alexandra. Alexandra. I admire you. It's cruel to leave us without an ending. Make up your own. Imagination's cool. Nice change from scrolling. Next. There you go. - Next! - What's in there? Have a look. It's only 1 p.m. Man, you know my secret. - What's your name? - Joseph. Okay, Joseph. This stays between us, right? Have a sister? Two? You can resell them. It's signed and worth a lot. You're the best. No, you're the best. Next! - It's for? - My mother. Cool. What's her name? Don't you recognize me? Caro. CHAPTER 1 CAROLINE Caroline Daugeron. Wow, it's been... Fifteen years. You still live in Elden? Yes. The Shipwreck gang, do you still see them? My mom told me to come. She's read all your books 10 times. That's flattering. You don't understand. She's read your horror stories 10 times over. Okay. So, she's a big fan. No, she's sick. Because of you. She hurt my father. She says they argued and he left, but that's a lie. She hurt him. Okay, Caroline, slow down. I don't know what you're talking about. She says she is Marianne. Marianne doesn't exist. I'm making it up. She wants you to go see her in Elden. She sent me here to tell you that. And you will go, all right? You will go back because you created this. Marianne exists because of you. It's fiction, Caroline. I don't have to explain. I do this for money. You don't make it up. You dream it. In junior high, you'd tell us. Remember the lighthouse, the nightmares? This is ridiculous. It's not ridiculous. Look. My mother gave me this for you. What is this junk? Open it! Goddamn it. Can we get security? At night, she watches me sleeping. She opens my door and stays behind it. She watches me for hours. She does this all the time. I only closed my eyes one time. She did this to me. - Come with us, miss. - I'm scared. Go back, or she will continue what she started. You know what that means? You know what that means? I'm going to be next. I don't want to. It's not fair. It's your nightmare, not mine! Go back there, please! Pierre is waiting for you. Yes, but I've earned this one. Who was the girl this morning? A friend from junior high. We were a whole gang of kids. You don't have real friends when you grow up. You only have acquaintances. And connections. What about your nightmares? I used to have recurring nightmares when I was a kid. There was always the same thing in them. What thing? Marianne. It stopped when I started to write. Then I invented Lizzie Larck to kick their ass. And I became rich. No, thank you. - Pierre is waiting for you. - I will have dinner with Pierre. After this one... I'll go see Pierre. EMMA, YOU STOOD ME UP. YOU'RE NOT HERE. YOU'RE PROBABLY DRUNK. DON'T WAKE ME. - PIERRE I am not drunk. Sorry. Sorry. I'm getting very small. Emma. Emma. Emma. Pierre, wake up. Pierre! Pierre! Wake up! Give me your foot. A nightmare? Yes. It had been a long time. Good. You deserve this. I'm sorry. Pierre, turn around. Want me to turn around? - Yes. - Are you sure? Yes. So, here I am. I have to wake up. You'll wake up when I decide. Come back. Come see me. Pierre? EMMA, I TOOK MY MOST IMPORTANT STUFF. THE OTHER STUFF WILL WAIT. I LEAVE YOU THIS POST-IT. - PIERRE MÜGEN PUBLISHING - Had a good night? - So-so. Because of Pierre? Not only that. The girl from yesterday is here. - Who? - The girl with the tooth. What? You let her in? She arrived at 7 a.m., before me. Fuck. She's crazy. Not as crazy as the Americans waiting for us. Damn it. She told reception you knew her. Emma! I'm here! Holy shit. Caro. Emma. She wants you to continue writing. She said she would take your parents. After she takes me. Okay. I will talk to her. Come down, will you? She said this from the beginning! At the lighthouse, since the beginning! Please stop this. Come down. You hear me? Come on down. You'll be fine. Bring this back... to my mother. Okay? No, Caro. Please stop. She never leaves empty-handed! The police are here. Maybe you should call your parents. She threatened your parents before jumping. No, no. I'm sure they're okay. You could call them. I don't feel like it. What do you mean by that? Sorry, but I don't understand. I know they're fine. I'm not calling them. No need to worry over nothing. I know they're fine. Worrying doesn't help. CALLING DARONS Mom? Hi. You've reached the Larsimons' voicemail. If you leave us a message, we will call you back. Talk to you soon. What is this tank? My father's car. Should have rented one. - I'm supposed to be on a break. - You got my stuff? Cool. - What do I put in? - E... L-D... E-N. Elden. We're off to Elden. CHAPTER 2 ELDEN Hi. You've reached the Larsimons' voicemail. The neighbors? I've tried everyone all weekend, even the neighbor. He went to check. The house is empty. Don't worry. I'm sure they've gone somewhere. We'll find them safe and sound. You've reached the Larsimons' voicemail. This will be the first time I'm happy to see them. Well, reassured. "Happy" is a bit of an exaggeration. - They're unbearable. - When was the last time? Christmas. Not the last one. Two years ago, I think. They must miss you. If you send your kid to boarding school 300 miles away you're not going to miss her much. I'm going to have a nap in the back. Okay. I'll pull over. What are you doing? You're putting your feet on... Damn it. Don't worry. - If you nod off, I'll flick you. - What? I'll flick you. Okay, stop it! Okay. I got it. Stop! What's Marianne like? In your books? You don't read them? I don't like horror. You've been working for me for six months and you haven't read one? They keep me up at night. Marianne looks like you and me. She's a witch. Deprived of a body, she wanders. She enters your soul, warps your body. She takes you over. She possesses you. The only thing Marianne cannot do is lie about her name. She can avoid the question, change the subject. But she cannot lie about her name. She is the wife of a demon. And how does Lizzie get rid of Marianne? She dies. Welcome to Elden. WELCOME TO ELDEN Come back to see me. Marianne born on a Tuesday Happy on a Wednesday Married on a Thursday Witch on a Friday Piece of crap. Emma. Bring this back... to my mother. Emma Larsimon. The priest. It's not yours. How would you know? I gave it to Caroline. To protect her. It worked really well. I'm not surprised to see you here. Why is that? Whenever something horrible happens here, you're around. I haven't been here in quite a while. Exactly. What brings you here? Keep it away from me. I can't help it. It's his instinct. You're staying for the funeral? Nobody wants you here. - Relax, priest. In two hours, I'm gone. - Very good. Do as you did 15 years ago. And don't come back. Go fuck yourself, asshole priest! Drive! What? Are you nuts? That was the Americans. I know. We'll call them back. Let's wrap up here and leave this town. Are we going to your parents? Caro's mother first. I'll wait here for you. No way. You're coming with me. Nobody's here. Hello. Emma. My goodness. I'm so happy to see you. It's been so long. Well, what is it? Ma'am... We're here to offer our condolences. What for? For your daughter. Oh, yes. It's sad. That's big cities for you. Come in, Emma. I'll make you some tea. Here. Sit here, both of you. There. It's unbelievable, all the stuff I keep. I just pile it up. I accumulate. Ma'am... Mrs. Daugeron? Here. Take it. Why? Caroline asked me to. She said you should have it. That's why we are here. Thank you so much, Emma. It's very kind of you... to fulfill the last wishes of the dead. She's totally crazy. I don't know. Let's get out of here. Catherine admired you a great deal. - Catherine? - My daughter. She devoured your books. I must admit I liked reading them, too. All those things, horrible and exciting at the same time. I don't know. They keep me alive. Do you want me to sign a copy? You would do that? That would be so nice. Of course. This one? I... Who do I sign it to? To Marianne, Emma. That would be perfect. It's for me. I can't wait to find out what happens next. Nothing. I'm done with Lizzie Larck. I'm going to write something else. Are you able to? Tell me the truth, Emma. Your nightmares are back, right? I've known you for so long. As a child, you would squeal and scream blue murder when you came here to play with Catherine. It's Caroline. It was. She hanged herself. - We have to go now. - Stay seated! I've prepared a feast for us. Ma'am, are you okay? Well... I had an accident, that's all. Now I'm soiled. Do you have a towel? I'll help you clean up. Try it! Put your hand here. You're scared? I'm filthy. Believe me, girls. You know nothing of filth. Actual filth. But you will, dear little Emma. I hope you're going to stay in Elden a while. You could write more about Marianne. The more people read about her, the better I feel. Okay. We're leaving. Go and see your parents, Emma. I went to see them first. Start the car! Before Catherine. Keep on writing. Or I'll visit the others as well. All of them! I never leave empty-handed, Emma. Never! Fuck. Where to? My parents'. Stay here. I'll be quick. What the hell? Dad? Dad? Mom and Dad? It's me. Mom? Mom? Mom? Oh, shit. - Emma? - Mom! - Oh, fuck. - Emma, wait! Fuck! - Emma! Emma, wait! - Shit! Emma, wait! Emma! Emma! Emma, wait! Emma! Let's get out of here. - Are they okay? - What do you think? Listen to me! Mom... you're in your bathrobe. Sorry. Embarrassed? Not embarrassed. I'm traumatized for life. Look, we didn't know you were coming. We're sorry you saw that. But your mother's right, Emma. No news for over a year, and you show up like this. We go about our lives. - Everybody makes love, Emma. - Fuck. Thanks, I know. I've tried calling all weekend. We were away. Why were you calling? Because of Caro. We know. The funeral's Tuesday. Let's have dinner, okay? We can talk over dinner, and your friend can join us. It's Camcam, my assistant. You like stuffed tomatoes, Camcam? Yes. - It didn't ring. - What? Because it's unplugged. What didn't sound? The alarm. Your father put in an alarm. You did, did you? You don't trust people now? Not at all anymore. When I watch the news, I feel I'm in a horror movie. Like your stories. I've stopped writing horror. I want to write something else. Really? What will you write about? I don't know. I'm waiting for a revelation. Speaking of revelation, I saw the priest. He was quite unpleasant. What do you expect after what you did? I thought forgiveness was an important part of his job. Maybe to be forgiven, you need the decency to ask for it. - Starting with your mother. - Give me a break. I said I was sorry, didn't I? Mom knows that I was young, okay? - Mom knows I said sorry. - Let's talk about something else. It's been a long time. Let's forget. Everybody makes mistakes. That's life. What matters is now. We are all here. I'm serving a meal. I'd like to have a nice, harmless conversation like anybody would. Is that too much to ask? - No. - No. Who will start talking about something nice and harmless? Okay. Think about it. I'll get the flan. There's enough for 10 people. We've had lots of cherries this year. You said they were unbearable, but they're not. They're just sad. They didn't want you to leave. You left. Seems you have a lot to be forgiven for. You're in no position to get involved in my private life. I'm on the floor in your childhood bedroom. After having had dinner with your parents. After walking in on them having sex. Everyone is cross with me. But you're here with me. Thank you. Light off? It's the old lighthouse. You get used to it. Good night. Oh, shit. Emma? Are you asleep? Someone's in here. Sorry. Screw it! Ma'am? Are you... Look at me! This is not us. Do you understand? Camille! It's me. Look at me. What happened? Your parents... What about my parents? Mom! Mom! Dad! Mom! Wait for me! Dad! Mom! Dad! Forgive me! Write!
