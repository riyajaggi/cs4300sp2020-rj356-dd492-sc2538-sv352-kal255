 [theme music] Play one of the best new FPS shooters, search Steam for PROJECT WARLOCK [music continues] [music continues] [intense music] [music continues] [music continues] Data parameters almost complete. We'll be up and running before our guest arrives. I think Dr. Quest will find this a most impressive demonstration. (male #1) 'Forget about Quest!'

 This thing has to prove itself to me first, Dr. Karel. Frankly, I think it's been a colossal waste of the army's time and money. I know your opinion, general. Believe me, my Geno Processor may prove itself 'more valuable for military defense than you think.' And sooner than you think, sir. It better, or I may have to call my friends at the Pentagon. This is a defense research facility not some mad scientist's lab. [electrical distortion] (Dr. Karel) 'Don't worry, Matthews.' Dr. Quest will understand what we've accomplished. (Matthews) 'The most advanced DNA based computer ever created.'

 [seagulls squawking] zap [whooshing] (Hadji) 'So, is my V.R. knight fight game challenging enough, Jonny?' (Jonny) 'Uh, not bad.' 'Yeah, how 'bout that broadsword?' - Right away! - ' Draw it economy size, Hadj!' (Hadji) 'Oops. Sorry.' [swords clanging] [grunting] (Jonny) 'Yes!' 'And now Knight Quest takes Red Queen.' [roaring] [grunting] 'Whoa! But the queen has dragon breath.' [roaring] (Jonny) 'N-o-o!' [whooshing] He he. Game over. Hell, not bad for a first try, huh, Hadj? Heh. Sooner or later, I'm gonna beat the program. (Dr. Quest) You sound like Leo Karel, Jonny. For years, he's been ahead of everyone in the field of bio-technology. And if this new DNA computer he's-- Did you say DNA computer? Leo calls them Geno Processors. 'He uses genetic material to replace silicon chips.' You see, in our bodies, DNA stores information just like-- The microprocessor in this laptop. I am most interested in seeing this cyber-hybrid. Making computers from living tissue? Sounds like playing with fire to me, doc. (Dr. Quest) 'I'm sure Leo knows what he's doing, Race.' [electrical discharge] (Dr. Karel) Program initiate. [electrical discharge] Impressive access speed. It's taking to the program with a vengeance, doctor. Hmm. Perhaps too well. I'm worried about sensory overload. [crackling] The output is indicating hightened cognitive response. [dramatic music] (Dr. Karel) Oh, no! - 'Maybe we should.' - 'An accident. That's all.' We'll just clean up and-- [dramatic music] (together) A-a-h! No! [screaming] [crackling] What's that? [intense music] Dr. Karel! [crackling] [screaming] [crackling] [dramatic music] [pleasant music] Dr. Quest, General Conrad Axton. Welcome to Fort Latimer. Tightest security in the South Pacific. Thank you, general. So tight, I thought about denying you port when I heard this slacker was aboard. [both chuckling] Good to see you too, general. The general, then colonel, was my C.O. Back in my enlisted days. We'll catch up later. I suppose you're anxious to see your friend the mad doctor, Karel. What is his DNA computer like, general? Costly, son. Costly. [engine revving] (Dr. Quest) 'Maybe, you should rename this place' "Fortified Latimer", sir.' Why the need for such high security, general? (Axton) 'There's some sensitive research being done' 'on this little atoll, son.' Even got a live nuke here. There's a prototype for a sub-oceanic missile silo right under our feet. - What a comforting thought. - You said it, Hadj. I love hearing "nuclear missile" 'and "right under your feet" in the same sentence.' Ah, you kids got nothing to worry about. Missile control is in Security Level Alpha. (Jonny) 'Electrified fencing.' (Axton) 'All sizzle, no steak.' 'Heck, I could hardly get into Level A myself. He he.' 'And I've got the launch codes.' [Bandit whimpering] Alright, Bandit. Now I'm worried too. [owl hooting] [Race gasping] - What the.. - This is Axton to Base Op. Possible intruder. We've got two down at biotech lab. 'Need medevac assistance on the double.' [intense music] - There's barely a pulse. - Leo.. Better let me go in first, doc. [music continues] Whatever happened, it's over now. [gasping] [dramatic music] (Dr. Quest) Leo.. Nothing to report. [rustling] Hold it. Thought I heard something. Nah. Just the wind. Everything's quiet. Yeah, check back in five. [gasping] [guard screaming] [crackling] [dramatic music] (machine) 'Authorized access only. Enter palm and retina print.' [music continues] 'Access approved.' [music continues] Well, doctor? Yeah, just like the others, I'm afraid. Faint pulse, no neurological response. And the limb rigor? Would indicate he's been this way for over a day. Can't be. Stood talking to him myself, just an hour ago. I'll know more when I get them back to base medical and run some tests. Let me know what you find, doctor. (male on radio) 'Base Op to General Axton.' 'We have a guard down in checkpoint Alpha 6.' 'Retina and palm I.D. show Dr. Karel just entered Alpha.' But that's impossible. Put Alpha on alert. Whoever it is, it ain't Karel. Up for a little security duty, Bannon? - Sure you trust a slacker, sir? - He he he. - Race, can we-- - You kids stay with the doc. [intense music] [engine revving] (Jonny) What is going on, dad? There appears to have been an overload. [sniffing] (Dr. Quest) This container obviously held the Geno Processor. 'And when it malfunctioned--' Some of the DNA stuff leaked out. 'Maybe onto Dr. Karel and his assistant.' 'But how does that explain--' That is what I need to find out. Dad, maybe we can find out what Dr. Karel was working on 'before his computer crashed.' It will certainly put our hacking powers to the test. (Axton) Computers don't lie, Bannon. Karel's hand and retina print were used to open this gate. (Race) 'But we just saw him at--' (machine) 'Authorized access only. Enter palm and retina print.' 'Access approved.' Maybe he had an accomplice who faked his I.D. All I know is, someone got in here. We're gonna find him. No one in or out without my permission. Yes, sir! (Dr. Quest) 'This genetic material' 'consists of highly energized DNA fragments.' Designed to receive electrochemical impulses. [intense music] [watch beeping] plop [crackling] - Dad.. - Just as I surmised. The DNA has become so highly energized it's able to drain the energy from my watch. Or a man. Yes, Dr. Quest. I'll begin administering an I.V. solution of electrolytic salts to all of them. Well, that should keep 'em stabilized until I can find a way to reverse the process. Dad, we're online. Accessing last program entered by Dr. Karel. '"Determine weaknesses in island security. "Attempt to breach security and launch sub-oceanic nuclear missile." But this is just a simulation, right? Unless the Geno Processor didn't think so. I believe it's decided to check out the security, itself. Do you mean the DNA computer walked out of here? For want of a better word. But first, it must have absorbed all of Leo's genetic information to get through the check-point. (Jonny) 'I hope you're calling General Axton.' He'd never believe that story coming from me. [intense music] (Axton on radio) 'Bannon, anything?' No, sir. Everything's quiet. Too quiet. (Race on radio) 'I'll check out security monitoring.' [music continues] [crackling] 'General Axton, I have Dr. Quest.' (Dr. Quest on radio) 'General, Dr. Karel's Geno Processor' 'is what's been breaching your security.' Are you serious? That bowl of jelly is moving around? Next thing you'll be telling me it's programmed to launch my nuke. 'It is. It's headed for--' Barracks 12. (Axton on phone) 'What! That's my launch team.' - 'Is there any way to stop it?' - I'll think of something. Meet me at Barracks 12. I'll send a chopper. 'We'll be ready.' [dramatic music] [intense music] [music continues] [alarm ringing] (male on radio) 'This is Base Op.' 'General Axton has ordered' 'Security Level A evacuated immediately.' [ringing continues] [dramatic music] Base Op, Bannon. I've got two more down. - Level A, monitoring. - 'Bannon, evacuate at once!' - But-- - 'That's an order!' Good thing I'm not still enlisted. Maybe the remote will give me some answers. [people screaming] [engine revving] [music continues] [chopper engine whirring] General Axton has ordered this entire security area evacuated. Guess he wasn't as hard to convince as I thought. But if, I mean when we stop the Geno Processor what will happen to Dr. Karel and the others? That's the good news, Hadji. Since the processor replicated Dr. Karel's retina print 'I believe this stored all electrical information' 'from its victims, intact.' (Jonny) 'So we've got to stop the processor.' 'But keep it in one piece.' [crackling] [dramatic music] [music continues] [intense music] [music continues] Axton! Base Op, where is Axton? (male on radio) 'Bannon, you're supposed to be--' Where is he? 'He's meeting Dr. Quest at Barracks 12.' [music continues] (Jonny) Dad, Bandit's on the DNA trail again. [Bandit whimpering] [ominous music] (Dr. Quest) 'They're part of the missile launch team.' We're too late. (Axton) 'Quickly, Dr. Quest. In here. We can still stop the launch.' General! We can stop it together. Doc...no! [Dr. Quest screaming] Dad! Race, no! Don't ' do it! You'll destroy dad too. [dramatic music] What do you mean? What does that thing want? The Geno Processor intends to launch General Axton's nuclear missile. It must have lured dad here because it knew he was smart enough to stop it. So, now, it's up to us. What's the fastest way to missile command? Special elevator at the end of the barracks. But only Axton and the button team have access. [intense music] (Race) Right behind you, Jonny. Get a medivac unit here right now. - What do I tell Base Op? - As little as possible. What we don't need are a bunch of trigger happy G.I.s down there. [Bandit squealing] With this DNA computer, we are always one step behind. First try, Hadji. Sooner or later, we're gonna find a way to beat the program. (machine) 'Authorized access only. Enter palm and retina print.' 'Access approved.' [Bandit whining] (Race) I don't like it either, boy. [dramatic music] This is General Axton. (machine) 'Voice spread confirmed.' 'Control room lockdown. Complete access denied.' [intense music] (machine) 'Control room lockdown.' 'Access denied on General Axton's command.' (Jonny) Race, he's starting the countdown! [dramatic music] [beeping] (computer) 'Target locked Washington, D.C.' 'Enter access codes to commence countdown to launch.' (Race) Abort the program, General! It's just a computer simulation. Don't think you can get in here to stop me, boy. That door can withstand a thermonuclear blast. Heh heh. - Access denied. - My program cannot be stopped. It's about time it earned its keep. It may look like a monster, Hadji but it's still just a computer. If we could get inside, maybe.. We cannot even get inside there. (Race) That control room is air conditioned. There must be access through the ducting. Thought you guys could use some help. (computer) 'Access codes confirmed.' 'Missile launch in T minus 30 minutes.' [dramatic music] The underwater missile silos. Knowing Axton, the abort codes must be in here too. Then we'll just have to get them out. I've got an idea. If we can temporarily short-circuit its electrochemical-- You sound just like your father. And I bet it'll work. Well, if it doesn't, we'll both be drained batteries. [Bandit whining] Hadji, I'm gonna need my V.R. and your laptop. And I'm going to need a fast ride. You're there. [chopper engine whirring] [intense music] (computer) 'T minus ten minutes.' [music continues] [crashing] [intense music] [music continues] [electrical discharge] [whooshing] (Jonny) 'Hadji, I'm in.' [zapping] 'I can feel the energy. You getting anything?' It is Dr. Karel. I'm scrolling his data. (Hadji) 'That is Matthews, Karel's assistant.' 'Hadji, each one of these neuroclusters' 'is a separate personality.' (Hadji) 'Try transferring their energy to disk.' (computer) 'T minus two minutes.' [whooshing] (Jonny) 'Got them!' (Race) Jonny, we're running out of time! Find Axton, get those.. Doc? (Jonny) 'It's dad. I can feel his warmth.' 'A-a-a-h!' (Hadji) 'Jonny, I did not get him.' [whooshing] (Jonny) 'I'm under fire!' 'Must be the Geno Processor antibodies.' 'Hadji, I need a shield!' 'A-a-h!' (Hadji) 'Jonny, that's Axton. I've got it!' The abort codes are 2-5-4-6, 7-5-9-8, 4-3-9-6. Jonny! [crackling] (Race) A-a-h! Jonny, abort codes.. [computer beeping] (computer) 'Countdown aborted.' Hadji, looks like I'm really gonna have to stop this thing from the inside. (Jonny) Don't run out on disk space. [zapping] Do not worry, I'm still here. I'm going to try rearranging this thing's DNA. Reverse my polarity and cross your fingers. [dramatic music] [crunching] [exploding] [whooshing] splat Do you really think this will work? It must work, doctor. This is my family. zap [intense music] [Bandit whining] C'mon, Jonny. [music continues] [Bandit barking] (Hadji) 'Jonny, you beat the program.' [grunting] First try, Hadj. (male #2) Now, we'll use the same process to the revive the others. [theme music]
