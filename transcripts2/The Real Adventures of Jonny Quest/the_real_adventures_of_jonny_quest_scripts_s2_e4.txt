 (male #1) 'Ha ha ha. I'd advise you to keep moving, Mr. Clark.' (Clark) 'Who are you? What's going on?' Ah! Ah! Ya-wo! Aah-whoa! (male #1) How disappointing. They didn't make it very far at all. I hope, Mr. Race Bannon will provide more amusement. zap [upbeat music] [pleasant music] (Corbin) 'There's the obstacle course I told you about.' Our country uses it to train all types of military and intelligence personnel. It looks very challenging. Gosh, Race, did you ever run it? You could say that, Jonny. (Corbin) 'Actually, boys..' ...your friend, Race holds our all-time speed record. - Still? After all this time? - I'm afraid so. A sad comment on my new breed of recruits but...what can I do? Good to see you again, sir. You remember Phil Corbin! - Hello Agent Corbin. - Dr. Quest. Boys. Well, you guys are still breathing. So, my man Bannon must be doing something, right? Oh, yes. Race is an excellent bodyguard. I'll say, we think he's just like a member of the family. woof woof Well, that makes it unanimous. Thank you for assigning him to us. Hey, Corbin, can we get on with it. You are right, Race. Sanderson, activate Sequence Alpha. beep (computerized vocalization) 'Activate cloaking mask. Desert mode.' Would you look at that? What do you make of it, doctor? Hmm. Some sort of holographic camouflage, I guess. Very good. That's exactly what it is, doctor. beep beep Look everyone! (computerized vocalization) 'Rocky to rainbow.' 'Snowfield mode.' 'Jungle mode.' 'Deactivate cloaking mask.' Amazing! Frightening too. What do you mean, Race? This technology could hide a whole army. Hide it until it's too late to defend against. Isn't that the whole idea to give our boys in the field an advantage over the enemy. Come on, I'll show you around. Actually, we owe this all to you, Dr. Quest. My quantum optical research was only theoretical. Maybe so, doctor. But those theories enabled your American scientists to develop the cloaking mask. Don't you mean, our American scientists? No. Not really. [hissing] [coughing] Corbin, why? Please, Race. Try to be more imaginative. This wonderful cloaking mask has more application than disguising jeeps. beep - Creed! - You remember. I'm flattered. (Jonny) 'Race! Race, wake up!' Jonny! I think we're in some real trouble here. You don't know the the half of it. That wasn't Corbin. It was Lucius Creed. An old enemy of mine. (Race) 'Where are the others?' I don't know. I just woke up too. So, who is this Creed jerk, anyway? Someone who shouldn't be alive. (Race narrating)  We met 12 years ago  on my first field assignment. Intelligence One  managed to trace him to an ancient castle  in Greenland. You guys would've liked  my partner, Greg Temple. He's the man that taught me  everything I know. He treated me  more like a kid brother than a junior officer. He'd seen it all.  Could handle anything. thud Creed was.. ...is a dealer in arms,  drugs, assasins, you name it. The renaissance man of scum. But his specialty  is stolen technology. This is it. Not a bad setup for a creep. This low life has expensive tastes. (computerized vocalization) 'The experimental nerve gas you requested' 'will be in your operative's hands' 'within six hours of payment.' (Dr. Zin on monitor) 'Excellent, Mr. Creed.' Your reputation for efficiency is well deserved. Thank you, Dr. Zin. I look forward to your future business. Now you beauties are gonna keep me in caviar for some time. What's next? boom Intelligence One, Creed. Give it up. We're taking you in. Not bloody likely. [gunfire] boom [gunfire] [firing continues] Temple, get your head down! boom Aah! [coughing] Racer, we better get out of here. [coughing] - Temple! - Race, get out of here. Now! That's an order. Hyah! [explosion] boom boom (Creed) 'You were lucky that day, Mr. Bannon.' I suppose, we both were. Alright, Creed, what's your game? Game, Mr. Bannon? This is deadly serious, I assure you. Where is my family, you creep? Safe for the time being, my boy. You see, I've gone through all the trouble of taking over this island eliminating its troublesome personel and acquiring "the cloaking mask" technology but to sell it at a worthy price I must record a compelling demonstration. Let me show you what I mean. Aa-a-ah! - That's Clark and Hill. - You know them? We trained together. Good men. No! (Hill on TV) 'Oh, man!' (Clark on TV) 'Who are you? What's going on?' 'Aah! Ya-ow!' Aa-a-h! (Creed) 'Hmm-hm-hm. Pity.' Those two barely lasted a minute. Hardly enough time for a proper demonstration for my prospective buyers. - Get to the point, Creed. - Certainly, Mr. Bannon. I've used the cloaking mask to disguise your old friend the training course which I modified and-- Sorry Creed, I can see where this is going. We're not about to jump through hoops for the likes of you. - Oh, not for me. - Let me guess. (Race) 'We've to run your little maze of death' or you'll hurt Hadji and the doc. Am I in the ballpark? A homerun, Mr. Bannon. This is old business between us, Creed. Let the boy go! (Creed) 'Sorry, Agent Bannon. He is your handicap.' Besides, I can't make things too easy for you. Why don't you leave your little toys at home and fight me, man to man? (Creed) 'Ha ha ha.' We can do it, Race. Come on, Race, let's find my dad. - Are you up to this, kiddo? - As long as you are. How do you think I got my nickname, Race? - That's not your real name? - Nope. It's Roger. Let's move! Roger? - So, this part is safe? - Not at all. Aw! Aah! - I get the message. - Hang on. Yah! Race, wait! I think I see something we can use. (Race) 'Good thinking, Jonny' (Race) 'These should come in handy.' Behind you! Oh! Uh! Aah! Argh! zap boom Great work. What did you do? Remember the film of your friends they fought these same vines. Clark's knife made a metal sound against the vines. Just like that spike. I knew they're fake, made out of metal. Smart kid. You disabled the control mechanism. Get out! [theme music] boosh boosh clink boom crackle crackle boom I think we damaged the camouflaged circuitry in the whole area. (Jonny) 'Good. We can see the tracks easier.' Race, slide! swish Good going, Jonny. Impressive, Mr. Bannon. But I do not appreciate it when you and that brat destroy my toys. whoosh [gunshots] We have to escape somehow to help Jonny and Race. [Bandit whimpering] I think I've found something. Nice work. But that crawl space is too small. - Even for you! - For me? Yes. woof (Jonny) 'What a show-off?' 'Creed disguised the course to look like a desert.' This must be the old climbing tower. Let's go! zing [rumbling] [gasps] [laser gunfire] Ha! Almost there. Aah! [rumbling] Uhh! Jonny, you can be my handicap anytime. (Jonny) 'I think that's the only way.' 'I guess we'll have to shimmy down.' No. That's what Creed wants. A couple of slow-moving targets. Let's surprise him. Ready pal? Waah-hoo! zap zap zap Uhh! Aah! thud Oh, this looks fun. No! That brat is actually helping Bannon. (Hadji) 'Hello! Excuse me!' Ah, pipe down. I'm sorry to distrub you, Mr. Goon. woof But would you please return our dog? How did you get out? And now Dr. Crest is gone, too. What? Okay smartmouth, stand back. Hey, where is everybody? gnash Aw! bang - He has a very hard skull. - Oh, he certainly does. Now, let's find the others. This complex is very big. How will find Jonny and Race? I think I know how to find out. As I suspected, the power source to run these supercomputers is some kind of fusion reactor. You see, Hadji. (Dr. Quest) 'Our host is using the cloaking mask' 'to turn the para course into a killing ground.' Oh, no! Can you shut down the program? Not from here but I have an idea. [gunfire] bam [firing continues] Race, I have an idea. [firing continues] Race, help me! There is not much time. - Hang on, Corbin. - Race, wait! It's probably a trap. - I must take that chance. - No. You can't! No more games. Ha ha ha. boom Jonny! Race! Ah. We are glad to see you. (Hadji) 'Yes. Very glad.' We managed to escape Creed's hospitality. Where is Bandit? Sorry, Jonny, he couldn't make it. (Creed) 'I'm sorry, you two, but this ends now.' 'I guess its true what they say, you Racer.' 'You always hurt the one you love.' [machine gun firing] So much for them. Time to deal with Quest and the other brat. bam - Going somewhere, Creed? - Its not possible. - Sure, it is. But I saw you killed, both of you. (Dr. Quest) 'You saw what we wanted you to see.' When I couldn't shut down your program I decided to send false information to your control board. You were watching your holograms fight our holograms. While the doctor here was faking you out Hadji got us out of your twisted little fun house. I guess that wraps it up. Not entirely. I got lots of friends but only one guy ever called me "Racer." crackle (Race) 'Isn't that right, Temple?' You were always a bright one, Racer. When Creed was killed all those years ago you took it as an oppurtunity to assume his identity. Why did you do it, Greg? Why do you think, you overgrown boy scout? The excitement, the thrills, all that money! I think it was the nerve gas. It killed the real Creed and warped your mind. That's your opinion. I think it gave me clarity of thought. Ha ha ha. Temple! No! - Race, there is no time. - We've to get out of here. You did all that you could, old friend. (computerized vocalization) 'Ten, nine, eight, seven' 'Fusion reactor detonation paused at seven seconds.' That's better. We'll meet again, Bannon. In the meantime, I've got buyers waiting to purchase this cloaking technology, you seem to left behind. What's this? No! [gunfire] (computerized vocalization) 'Countdown recommences at seven seconds' 'Six, five..' I've engaged the EMP counter measures and I've given this baby all she's got. It should've happened by now. Everyone, brace for impact. boom Well, that's that. I've filed a full report with Intelligence One. Poor Temple. It really wasn't his fault. We know, Race. The effect of that old nerve gas is well documented. You made it through those traps safely. That is the most important thing. That's thanks to Jonny. Cut it out, Race, before you embarrass me to death. - Okay. On one condition. - Name it. Once in a while, I'd sure like it if you'd called me, "Racer." Once upon a time, my very best friend in the world called me that. (Race) 'I can't see a reason why my new best friend can't do the same.' (Jonny) 'You got it, Roger.' [all laughing] (Iris) 'Welcome to Questworld.' 'Please specify desired data.' 'Commencing deletion of saturn file.' [upbeat music] 'Searching.' [music continues] 'File found.' 'File deleted.' 'Thank you for accessing Questworld.' [theme music] [music continues]
