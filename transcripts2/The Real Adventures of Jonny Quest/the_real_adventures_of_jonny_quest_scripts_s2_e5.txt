 - My serve. - My dog. And Bandit won't give up the ball unless I say so. Oh, really? Bandit. Give. [whimpers] Traitor. [creaking] What's that noise? Shutters open. (Iris) 'Opening shutters.' [Bandit barking] Oh, no, it's that racoon again. Shutters closed. (Iris) 'Closing shutters.'

 [Bandit barking] (Jessie) 'Here, Bandit.' [barking continues] (Jonny) Garage door open. (Iris) 'Opening garage door.' (Jonny) Bandit, come back here! [barking] [wind howling] [whistling] Bandit, come! Yeah, before we all freeze out here. Let me try a little trick I learned in India. [rope whooshing] (Jonny) 'Must've been Western India.' 'Hey, nice ropin', Hadji.' Now come on, Bandit. (Jessie) Yeah, give the raccoon a break. [wind howling] [chuckles] What a watchdog. (Jonny) Close garage door. (Iris) 'Closing garage door.' [intense music] [growling] [music continues] (Iris) 'Disturbance in engineering room.' [alarm blaring] What? Must be Bandit chasing that raccoon again. [intense music] [clattering] Sounds like he might have caught it. Or the other way around. [Bandit whimpering] Bandit? Then...who's.. [growling] Unh! [dramatic music] [Bandit barking] [Bandit growling] hyah [growling] [clattering] Bandit! Race, what in the.. [groaning] - Race, are you hurt? - Just my pride. That thing jumped me. Whatever it is, I'm goin' after it. Jonny, wait! [intense music] [wind howling] [gun clicks] [gun fires] [growling] [guns firing] [growling] I think we winged him, Kane. Not good enough, Deke. To prove we bagged the Bigfoot we need to bring in a body. (Deke) 'There he is!' [gasps] [guns firing] [gasps] Wait! [Race grunts] - Kane, there's two of 'em. - One for each of us. (Jessie) What do you creeps think you're doing? [speaking foreign language] [grunting] (Deke) Hey! That's my property. And this is my property. I don't allow hunting on the Quest compound. Pretty high-end weaponry for a couple of hotshots who don't know what they're doing. I beg to differ. My name is Kane Klemper. And I've hunted big game all over the world. Believe me, I wasn't hunting you. Deke and I were tracking Bigfoot. Bigfoot? Think I got him, too. (Jonny) You almost got us. An unfortunate mistake, my boy. Poor visibility. You did appear right after the Bigfoot disappeared. Luckily, so did Race. How can you be so sure this Bigfoot you're chasing is real and not some elaborate hoax? Hunter's instinct. The kind that led me to the last red rhino in Africa. And thanks to you, it's extinct. I beg to differ, young lady. It still exists.. ...in my trophy room. Now, can we have our rifles back? Race.. Do your trophy hunting somewhere else 'before someone besides an innocent animal gets hurt.' 'Now get lost.' Thank you for the warning. Again, our apologies for the mishap. Come, Deke. Think I'll escort the great hunters back to the road. [engine revving] Dad, look! It's a piece of my prototype stabilizer. The hunters must have shot it while they were chasing after-- (Jessie) Bigfoot! This track must be almost two feet. (Jonny) But Bigfoot's just a legend, Jess. Legends often have a factual basis, Jonny. Hadji's right. Researchers have compiled over a hundred credible Bigfoot sightings going back 50 years or more. But weren't they all in the northwest, Dr. Quest? Until recently, Hadji. Over the last few weeks, there have been a rash of sightings. That explains those vultures with guns. With any luck, those vultures are headed back to Boston. (Race) As for the footprint, maybe it was Bigfoot. Or just a thief trying to pretend he's one. [sighs] What a mess. [scraping] Hello. [Bandit whimpering] What a brave watchdog you turned out to be. Sure nothing else is missing, doc? (Dr. Quest) 'I'm positive, Race.' The only item stolen was the prototype for my Deep Space Navigational Shield. And it will be useless without this vital circuitry. So Bigfoot got away empty-handed. (Race) 'If it was a Bigfoot.' I'm still not convinced, Jonny but maybe this surveillance tape will change my mind. (Hadji) 'Incredible!' 'That creature appears to be at least eight feet tall.' Huh! Felt more like ten. (Jessie) 'Look at the glowing eyes.' - A nyctalope. - A what? Humans that can see in the dark, dad. My daughter, the brain. What would a missing link want with one of your prototypes, dad? What's this thing do, anyway? Well, the navigational shield was designed to screen out electromagnetic disturbances.. ...which are disruptive to a space probe's advanced guidance system. Oh, yeah, that explains it. But what does Bigfoot need a widget like this for? Too bad we cannot find him to ask him. Perhaps we can, Hadji. I've been installing a tracking device in all my prototypes in case they should fall into the wrong hands. I get it. If the snow stops by morning, we might just be able to track-- Yes! Tomorrow we're going Bigfoot hunting. Uh, without guns, of course. Oh, no. We'll be doing the hunting, young lady. You and the guys will be staying right here. [helicopter whirring] [helicopter whirring] (Race) 'Forget the Bigfoot, doc.' He couldn't have gotten this far, this fast. What do you think those big feet are for, dad? [all laughing] The signal's coming from up there. 'Near the summit of Mount Washington.' The Killer Mountain. Figures. [rattling] Why do they call it a killer mountain, Dr. Quest? Winds at the summit often exceed hurricane force. (Race) 'Hang on!' The only way we're gonna reach the summit is in the Questcat. [clears throat] So that is the last trap. [helicopter whirring] Hey, we've got company, Kane. (Deke) 'It's those guys from last night.' 'What are they doing here?' I don't know. But they better not get in the way of our hunt. We're not on their property this time. [intense music] We'll plow our way up and check out the signal. Jonny, you stay here and watch Jessie. But Race, we can follow on snowmobiles. Race is right. The weather is too rough up there. (Hadji) Do not worry, Jonny. If we find Bigfoot, I will get him. [engine revving] [sighs] Well, what do we do now? You might have beat me in ping-pong.. ...let's see how you do on a snowmobile. [engine revving] If that's a challenge, I accept. Come on, Bandit! [Bandit barking] [engine revving] [sniffing] (Jonny) Bandit, come back here! (Jessie) He must have gotten wind of another raccoon. (Jonny) 'Great! We'll be chasing Bandit while Hadji finds Bigfoot.' [Bandit barking] (Jessie) You're such a hot dog, Jonny Quest. (Jonny) Jess, look at these tracks. Bandit's gotten wind of something alright but it's no raccoon. [Bandit barking] [Bigfoot groaning] [Bandit barking] [Bigfoot groaning] - Jess, it's.. - I know. (Jessie) 'But not the same one who broke into the compound.' 'It's too small.' Bandit, pipe down. [groaning] Don't be afraid. Yeah. We won't hurt you. [Jonny and Jessie grunting] I can't see a thing. Hold it, Race. We're right on top of it. [footsteps] Amazing! The creature was intelligent enough to find the homing device and detach it. But why leave it way up here? Unless-- (Race) They were using it as bait. [intense music] There. See? We said we wouldn't hurt you. [breathing heavily] [gun fires] (Jessie) 'It's those jerks again.' I'll try to stop them. You get Bigfoot out of here. [guns firing] [engine revving] Out of the way, kid! It's the Bigfoot we want. Now move! Anything you say. [engine revving] Aah! (Jonny) Yes! [engine revving] [gun firing] [intense music] [chuckling] I have a spot all picked out on my trophy board for you. Aah! Ooh. [engine revving] [intense music] Guess this one's all mine. And I'm not taking any chances. Not the elephant gun, you fool! You'll cause an.. [gun fires] (Kane) 'Avalanche!' [rumbling] (Race) Stick close, guys. This could get ugly. Race, perhaps, they mean us no harm. [rumbling] Back to the QuestCat. Come on! [intense music] [rumbling] [engine revving] [rumbling continues] [rumbling] - Hang on! - We'll never outrun it. Wait, look! He wants us to follow him. (Jonny) 'Through a solid wall?' (Jessie) You got any better ideas? [rumbling] (Jonny) Guess it wasn't so solid after all. (Jonny) Must've been some kind of hologram. (Jessie) Definitely. But why? [growling] (Jonny) 'I hope that's a hologram.' [growling] [grunting] Definitely real. And real unfriendly. [speaking indistinctly] [growling] (Jessie) 'I'm not fluent in Bigfoot, Jonny' but I think the little one's trying to save us. Yeah, but I just wish he was a little bigger. [speaking indistinctly] [speaking indistinctly] (Race) We were lucky to survive that avalanche. (Hadji) Looks like our luck is running out. Hang on! I'm gonna try and back this puppy up. [engine revving] Oh! It seems our luck has returned. Yeah, this Questcat must have nine lives. - Whoa! - Aah! (Race) Stop! [intense music] Oh! Doc doesn't stand a chance against those creatures. We-we gotta help him. Somehow, I have the feeling they will not harm him. Our little friend spoke the same language as that other creature and yet, they're different species. [intense music] That explains it. I think I liked him better with fur. [intense music] [music continues] [speaking indistinctly] I cannot wait to leave this cursed planet with its hostility. Huh? You speak our language? (Dr. Quest) I see you've met my son, Tala. - Dad? - Dr. Quest? These two young ones helped my son escape from hunters. As I tried to explain, you can't judge all humans by the actions of a misguided few. How about explaining something to me? Like, what you're doing in this spaceship with all these-- Extraterrestrials? Tala and his fellow space explorers need my help, Jonny. (Dr. Quest) Even though they used a somewhat unorthodox method to bring me here. Forgive us, Dr. Quest. But our contacts with your species over the years have been fraught with danger. whoosh We were exploring this galaxy a century ago when a malfunction caused us to crash 'shattering vital circuitry beyond repair.' 'We were forced to wait until mankind' 'had created technology for the repair of our ship.' (Jessie) Why couldn't you just ask us for help? At first, we tried, but the pollution and ozone depletion of your planet necessitated genetic adaptation to protect our sensitive bodies. So that explains the fur. (Tala) 'Ironically, it was that fur which caused us to be 'constantly hunted by your species.' (Jonny) 'They thought you were some kind of missing link.' It does not matter now. We will soon be gone thanks to your father's device. (Kane) I beg to differ. You are coming with us. [laughs] Who needs Bigfoot? We got aliens and a flying saucer. Books, talk shows.. We're going to be rich, Kane! How did you get in here? We followed you, my boy. Our guard would have stopped you. Ha ha, couple of darts stopped him. [aliens growling] [guns firing] [aliens groaning] [intense music] [Deke chuckles] Wait till we march this menagerie into town. Let them go. They've waited years to go home. Not my problem. [dramatic music] [guns firing] Get this mongrel off me! - Eh! - Ah! [Bandit growling] Uh! No! These things cause too much trouble on your world. [Bandit growling] hya [grunting] [intense music] Thank you for your help, Dr. Quest. You too, Bannon. - Good luck, Tala. - Take care. Guess this is goodbye. Yeah. Thanks for saving us from that avalanche. Welcome. [pleasant music] You fools! You're letting a fortune get away. Let who get away? Did you see anything, Hadji? - I did not see a thing, Jonny. - Me either. [instrumental music] [music continues] See? You should have been shooting video instead of guns. [whirring] (Iris) 'Welcome to Quest world.' 'Warning. Warning.' 'Virus detected. Warning.' 'Warning.' 'Acknowledged. Running anti-virus program.' 'Searching.' 'Searching.' 'Virus imported by Jeremiah Surd.' 'Terminating virus.' 'Surd virus destroyed.' 'Thank you for accessing Quest world utilities.' [theme music] [music continues]
