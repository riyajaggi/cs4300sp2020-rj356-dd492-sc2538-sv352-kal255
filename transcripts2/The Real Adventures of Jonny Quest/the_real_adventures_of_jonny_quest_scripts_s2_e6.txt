 [theme music] Play one of the best new FPS shooters, search Steam for PROJECT WARLOCK [music continues] [pleasant music] [music continues] Attaboy, Bandit! Keep chasing me.

 Nah. It works fine. See? [boom] Whoa! [yelps] bam Ugh! Oh, no! Jonny. Uh, I'm sure it'll buff out. (Dr. Quest) 'Jonny, didn't I tell you that that hoverboard' was off limits until I got the glitches out? But, dad, it was working great. Forget it. Accidents happen, doc. I just hope Jess didn't get into any.. Well, Hadji, how did she do? Quite well.

 She will pass her driving test with no problem. Hadji is a great teacher, dad. I don't see why you didn't let Race teach you. He's the best. Compliments will get you nowhere. I don't know, he-he makes me kinda nervous. One day though, I want to take this for a spin. - Hey, is this a ding? - Don't ask. Uh-oh. You're in trouble now, Jonny Quest. Jesse...still interested in helping me and Hadji in the V.R. lab? You bet! Later, guys. Later is right. I won't even get my learner's permit for another year. Thanks, Bandit. But I'm done. Time for a little R and R behind the wheel. My day off, you know. - Have a good time. - Oh, I will. - Here catch. - What? B-b-but I thought you were.. Mad? Get in. Unless you're nervous to drive this thing. No way! [barking] Sorry, Bandit. No dogs allowed. Nothing personal. [engine idling] I do not believe it. (Jesse) 'He didn't have a permit.' (Race) 'Now, take it easy.' Alright, Race. [tires screeching] [upbeat music] He never lets me drive his car. All things come to those who wait, Jesse. But Race knows waiting is not one of Jonny's strong points. (Race) I'm letting you drive till the end of the property. (female automated voice) 'Please fasten driver's shoulder restrain.' Huh? That's Jesse's voice. Dr. Quest and I synthesized it when we started converting this baby into a smart car. Cool! 'So, how am I doing?' (Race) 'Well, I haven't ejected, yet.' (female automated voice) 'Please do not ride the brake.' Jesse's just learning, and now she's telling me how to drive. That's the public road, Jonny. Better pullover. [engine idling] I'll take it from here. [helicopter hovering] (Race) 'Jonny, get back!' [firing] Drive! [dramatic music] Bannon's not alone. A boy is with him. Just stop the car, Lorenzo, and bring them both to me. And remember, we want Bannon unharmed. (Jonny) Race, we've got a problem. We're not on private property anymore. I know. Keep your eyes on the road. [gun firing] [gunfire] (Lorenzo) 'Surd, Bannon's got armor plated tires.' That does it! I spent a fortune on this paint job. zap [music continues] [explosion] Sunroof shield! [firing continues] (female automated voice) 'Sunroof shield deployed.' Ah! Ugh! [tires screeching] Steady, Jonny. [music continues] [tires screeching] [horn blaring] [horn blaring] - Race! - Evasive action. Emergency. (female automated voice) 'Radar indicates clearance.' [whooshing] Whoa! (female automated voice) 'At maximum acceleration.' 'Reinstating manual control.' (Race) 'Take over, Jonny.' I'll do a choper check topside. [music continues] zap - Argh! - Aah! (female automated voice) 'Electrical system loosing power.' (Jonny) 'Race, we're slowing down.' Ohh! [horn blaring] crash [tires screeching] Race? Lorenzo, you fool! I said we wanted him unharmed. Hey, I was just trying to stop the car. click [whirring] [glass shatters] You can relax now, Julia. I got him. Both of 'em. (Julia on radio) 'Don't take any chances. You know what to do.' [intense music] Whoever did this, better have good insurance. Lorenzo. Still a lackey for that maniac, Surd? Or has he finally promoted you to toady? Ha. Wise guy, huh? Pleasant dreams, Bannon. [both coughing] [helicopter whirring] [dramatic music] Wake up, Bannon. It's time to play. Ugh! Please, Mr. Bannon don't waste your energy on these restrains. Let the boy go. It's me you want. But of course it is. After all you were the man responsible for my being like this. No, Surd. You're responsible. I didn't tell you to threaten Chicago with nerve gas. 'If you hadn't, that SWAT team wouldn't bust into your lab.' That SWAT guy's orders were shoot to kill. Race saved your life, Surd. So, I could spend the rest of my life in a metal shell? Thanks you so much, Mr. Bannon. But now, it's pay back time. We're going to play a little game in Quest World, Bannon. (Surd) But I've added a new wrinkle to my cyber playground. And all you get to do, is watch, kid. In this game, winner takes all. And I do mean all. [dramatic music] I hate computer games, Surd. Ugh! Uhh! Uhh! [grunting] bam Arr-r! Aah! (Surd) 'Only a game, yet the pain is real.' Thanks to my new Neuro-Cyber Optics program. But you ain't felt nothing, yet. bam Race! Aah! I'll let you watch, boy.. ...but don't think you can stop me. I'm on a roll! [engine revving] Uhh-ohh-ah! (Surd) 'Enjoying my version of Quest World, Mr. Bannon?' 'Don't worry, it will all be over momentarily.' [laughing] zap [Race screaming] thud Race! Are you okay? Never felt better. [gasps] Jonny. Jonny.. No! No! (Race mumbling) Jonny.. No! (Race) It can't be. [Surd laughing] Welcome to my nightmare, Mr. Bannon. That's amazing, Surd. You actually swapped bodies with the guy. I prefer to call it a Neuro-Cyber transfer, Lorenzo. But yes, it did work perfectly. And you couldn't have picked a finer body. Control yourself, Julia. We can celebrate later. Now, release me. There's work to be done. [dramatic music] You'll never get away with this, Surd! [laughing] I already have, boy. And now, I must get rid of the one person with enough intelligence to reverse the process. Dr. Benton Quest. No! Yes. I'm going to pay Benton Quest a brief visit. His last. You see, the good doctor will never suspect his loyal and trusted friend.. [clearing throat] ...Race Bannon. - No-o-o! - 'Ha ha ha.' [intense music] [engine revving] Keep him in camera range. But stay back, Lorenzo. We don't want Quest suspecting anything. Until it's too late. Roger. And don't worry, Julia, I'll keep an eye on Surd. Uh, Bannon, for you. [helicopter whirring] - Nice set of wheels. - Likewise. [engines idling] (Race) He's not gonna stay with you, Julia. He doesn't need you anymore. Shut up, Bannon! You don't know him. He's loyal to me. Once, you and Quest are out of the way we'll be together the way I always dreamed we'd be. [somber music] I'm getting worried, Jesse. Jonny and Race should've been back. Don't be paranoid, Hadji. They'll be back. We could go out looking for them. 'You could drive.' Oh, well, if you put it that way. [engine revving] It won't be long, now. Fall back, Lorenzo. You're going to lose him, Julia. - He doesn't need-- - He needs me! He's always needed me. Yes, when he was in this chair, Julia. But he has a strong, healthy body now. He can have any woman he wants. Yeah, the girls are always falling for Race. You keep quiet! Both of you! Ugh! Guess I must have pushed the right buttons. And not a minute too soon. Dad, are you okay? What happened to your car? Nothing. [clears throat] Nothing. It drives fine. Fine? Look at these dents. Where is Jonny, Race? I dropped him.. ...at the movies. The movies? He's probably glued to his seat. He could've at least called, asked us to come. Now, I must see Quest.. ...alone. Quest? He's right where he's been all day. In the lab, of course. No, the lighthouse. - Dad, what is-- - This won't take long. [intense music] Hurry, Jonny. [music continues] click (Race) Surd's heading for the lighthouse. You have to warn the doc that I'm...not me. If he's still at a computer, maybe I can hack into it. 'There's not much time.' - Jonny, he's in. - So am I. Dad, watch out. [clicking] [intense music] Surd is in Race's...body. Surd! You're son is resourceful, doc. Whoa! Ooh! But too late! thwack [grunts] I intend to stay in this body. With you gone, no one will be able to stop me. [Bandit barking] Ow! Stupid mutt! [yelps] Argh! Race, what are you doing? (Dr. Quest) 'It's Surd.' He's inhabiting Race's body. Ugh! - Ohh! - Uh! Hah! Dad, don't! bam thud [music continues] Aah-h! You'll have to do better than that. thud - Sorry. - Thanks, Hadji. Ho! I think I broke my hand. Where did you learn those moves, Dr. Quest? Well, can't spend all those years with Race Bannon, and not pick up a few pointers. If Surd is in dad's body, then that means my dad is.. [gasps] Dad, please respond. "Thanks for the warning. We're all fine." [Race sighs] Nice going, Jonny. My dad. Dr. Quest, can we reverse the process? If I can access Surd's programing.. "Can you download Surd's Cyberswitch program "into the lighthouse computer?" I think so, dad. Well, can you? Give me a few minutes, Jesse. You and Hadji prepare the V.R. helmet. [intense music] Logging on. We're going hot. I hope this works. Your dad's never let me down, yet. [intense music] [groaning] Dad? Ah! Hey, who clipped me on the jaw? Sorry about that, Race. But I had to defend myself. Ah! My head. I-I'm regretfully responsible for the head. Just untie me, guys. And you'd better warn, Jonny. If I'm back, then, so is Surd. "Transfer complete." Yes! I'm outta here. [somber music] Huh? Off! Where do you think you're going, boy? Just sit there, and shut up. And this is for you, Bannon. [groaning] Julia, no! It's me, Jeremiah. I'm back in this twisted shell. [helicopter whirring] [whirring continues] - So, is Quest dead? - As a doornail. Old guy put up quite a fight, though. (Julia on radio) 'Lorenzo, return at once.' 'The body swap failed, but we still have the boy.' Not for long, you don't. Aah! [helicopter whirring] - Be careful, dad. - Don't worry, Jessie. (Hadji) 'Our worries have just begun.' 'Look at this! Surd's transmitting something.' "You managed to spoil my new choice of body. "You'll be pleased to learn I've made another selection. - Your son." - Huh! (Surd) A little young, perhaps. But I trust you'll wait for me, Julia. [beeping] Surd's blocked access to his mainframe. (Julia) 'All secure.' Instituting V.R. program...now. [beaming] (Jonny) 'You won't defeat me as easily as Race, Surd.' - This is my turf. - We'll see about that, boy! beep [Surd chuckling] whoosh clank Argh! [swishing] You can't escape me, boy! [engine revving] vroom clink [engine revving] [screaming] Aah! [helicopter whirring] crash (Julia) Lorenzo, what took you so long? - Ohh! - I had to find the place. I'll make you sorry you came back, Bannon! Those things are dangerous, lady. Ye-aah! Aaah! Ugh! [engine revving] Game over, boy. You lose! No! You lose. whoosh Take that, Surd! And that! [groaning] What do you know? Jonny's kickin' his butt all over cyberspace. Oh, Race, I was just about to clean his clock. Give him a break, Jonny. He's finished. Besides, we have to leave something for the police to arrest. [chattering on radio] I'm sure glad I ended up with you and not Jeremiah Surd for a father. I should have let him keep my body a little longer. Like until he paid to fix my head my jaw and my car. Hey, look at it this way, Race. It couldn't get any worse. (Race) 'Yeah.' [hissing] (female automated voice) 'Tire pressure, low. Oil pressure, low.' - 'Steering fluid, low.' - Oh, man! (female automated voice) 'Brake fluid, low.' [sirens wailing] [theme music] [music continues]
