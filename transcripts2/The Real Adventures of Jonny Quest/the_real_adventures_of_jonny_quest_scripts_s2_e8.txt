 in space as it did in his lab. Don't worry, General Yala. Doc's system can pick off signals better than a first base coach. Then, beam 'em back with pinpoint accuracy. Thanks for the vote of confidence, boys. Everything's A-okay, President Horkarno. We should be getting to the command center, sir. 'Launch is only 15 minutes away.' They are gone. Cutting it kind of close, aren't we? Bandit, come back here. [barking] Hadji, head him off.

 [dramatic music] [barking] - Ah! - Ah! (male #1) 'By the time command center discovers they can't control' 'the satellite-- it'll be too late.' Ha ha ha! Hadji, something's going on. - What the.. - It's the Quest kids. [dramatic music] - Where'd they go? - Forget them. We are getting too close to launch. And put that away, before you blow us both up. [dramatic music] Surprise. [screaming] thud Aha, you have the best seat in the house. The boys should have been here by now, Race. They're gonna miss the lift-off. (Race) 'No offence, doc. But they're probably out joy-riding. 'Let's say, Jonny finally talked Hadji into taking him surfing. - Help! - Over here. - Help! - Help! It's no use, Jonny. They cannot see us. They've gotta, because in less than five minutes 'we're gonna be toast.' There's no way out of here, Hadji. Even if we stood on each other's-- [barking] (Jonny) 'Bandit, where have you been?' Come on, Bandit, show me. 'Come closer. Come on, Bandit.' 'Attaboy! You see, yeah. That's it, boy!' Come on, closer. 'Closer.' Good boy! Good hunter! But we've gotta haul. [whirring] (Jonny) '20 seconds and counting.' We will never clear the blast area in time, Jonny. Hang on! [tires screeching] Whatever those creeps did to the satellite it's too late now. Unless we can get dad to abort the mission. You will never reach him in this vehicle. Then we'll reach him on foot. Come on! Orbital trajectory is excellent. boom [grunting] What are you doing? Quiet! [dramatic music] Stay down, doc. Hold it right there, gentlemen. thud Lucky for you. I'm on your side. General Yala, what is the meaning of this? I guess you could call it a military coup, Mr. President. But it is so much more. Instituting system override. Telemetry parameters, complete. And now it begins. They've transferred control of the satellite to another location, Mr. President. But why? Dr. Zin. Yes, Dr. Quest. Because now I am in control. (Dr. Zin) 'It has been a long time, Bannon.' Well, look what the cat dragged in. I see you are as rash as ever. (Dr. Zin) 'And as you can see, I have not been idle--' [beeping] (man on radio) 'Code Red from Missile Command Center.' 'Dispatching armored units.' (Dr. Zin) 'I have been waiting and watching' 'for the right opportunity.' With a partner like Dr. Zin, who needs democratic elections. You will never take over Melanesia. My army will stop you. Even if you kill me. Let them try. Most of the commanders are on my side. Only a few divisions are still loyal. And those have already been targeted. [whirring] boom No! Bravo, Dr. Quest. Your system does deliver with pinpoint accuracy. (General Yala) 'Though, not in the way you intended.' (Dr. Zin) 'A very impressive visual acuity, too.' boom My troops. In disarray, Mr. President. Before they even know what has happened to them. General, the tank unit has already been dispatched. But how? [panting] vroom - Stop. - Over here. Something big's going down, Hadji. Come on. [dramatic music] boom zap boom Ah! [screaming] [explosion] So much for securing Melanesia, general. But as you know, I am interested in more global entertainment. Leaders of the western world, this is Dr. Zin. You'll soon witness proof that I am in control of a satellite that can destroy anything on earth, I choose. I demand five million dollars in gold bullion delivered within 48 hours. Or there will be dire consequences. (Dr. Zin) 'You have been warned.' Doc, isn't that the U.S. Airforce Base in Hawaii? [whirring] boom Satellite approaching orbital transmission factor secondary target. [intense music] Ah-h! thud Enjoying the show? The leaders of the world will never agree on anything, Dr. Zin. Oh, I know that. And if I were them, I would be scrambling missiles to take out this installation. We've gotta move, Hadji! (Hadji) 'Since when do you know how to drive one of these?' Tank Leader 2. Highest score ever recorded. Only this time the enemy is real. woof General, look. [firing] Estimated time to impact, ten minutes. Plenty of time. Bring Dr. Quest to me. - Ugh! - Come on. As for you, Bannon, enjoy the fireworks displayed. We shall not meet again. I wouldn't count on it, Zin. Zin. Farewell, Mr. President. You're right about our country entering a new era. The era of the ironed fist. [whirring] In seven minutes, I will be President. [whirring] Who is that? Not one of ours, Gen.. Mr. President. We warned our men to stay away from this road. Take care of them. [intense music] Missile attack! boom [grunting] Run! [barking] boom - Now? - It's game over. moo Time to play by my rules. Two minute warning, sir. I do not fear death, Mr. Bannon. I just fear what a man like Yala will do to my country. Jonny, what in the world.. Thanks, guys. You got in here just in time. [whooshing] Now, where to run? We are at ground zero. (Johnny) 'Then we need to get below ground zero.' Help me, Hadji. It's a drain pipe. Ah! [whooshing] boom - Ah-h! - Ah-h! boom Everybody down. Where's Bandit? [barking] Okay, Race, what's going on? Where is dad? Zin. Why are you keeping me alive? (Dr. Zin) 'So you can witness my final triumph, Dr. Quest.' I am relieved. For a moment I thought you might be letting greed overshadow you megalomania. A pity. - Zin. - At last, we meet. Face to face. Forgive me if I don't shake hands. The command center is destroyed. Race, Horkarno-- And your son and his little friend are also dead. I don't believe you. Really, general. You are cruel. I was hoping to spare the good doctor that blow. But since you let the cat out of the bag. I am sure you understand, Dr. Quest. I could not allow them to spoil the launch. No, Jonny, Hadji, no. The doc's definitely on that freighter. Then, let's move. Oh, no, we've been lucky this far but I'm going solo from here on in. You and Hadji wait with the President. Hang on to this, Jonny. Just in case. Ah! [grunting] Hurry up with those supplies. You there, why aren't you on watch? 'I said--' thud Bannon? Stop that man! [gunshots] [firing continues] boom Put out that fire and find that man. Yes, general. A cheap trick, but it worked. Quick, in here. - Jonny, this was-- - Another rotten idea. [sniffing] Hmm. zap Dad's in there. (Hadji) 'Of course, guarded by two well armed neanderthals' 'Any bright ideas, my friend?' You mean, ones that don't stink? Give me a minute. What's that? What's this? Ah! Ah! [beeping] Ah! - Jonny, Hadji-- - Don't even ask. Right. What matters now is disabling that satellite. (Dr. Zin) 'I think not, Quest.' Uh, your dog put up quite a fight. I told you it was a mistake leaving Quest alive. Yes, perhaps I let my vanity get the better of me, general. So I give you my full permission to rectify the situation. (Race) 'Jonny, hit the deck.' [firing] Zin dynasty cannot be stopped. [firing continues] Argh! Dad? Zin is not gonna destroy half the world using my technology. Ah! Ah! Doc, we need to abandon this ship. Not until I reprogram the satellite. [beeping] Cutting it kinda close aren't we, doc? Zin's takin' the easy way out. As usual. Jump for it! boom Maybe, now you can get your country back, sir. Yes, with General Yala-- Gone? I am still alive, Horkarno. Which is more than I can say for you. [barking] Stupid mutt! Oh! That was a pretty impressive right hook there, Mr. President. Oh, what's that? Empirical evidence that Zin did not remove my self-destruct failsafe. boom (President Horkarno) 'General Yala promised his men untold riches' now their loyalty to him has disintegrated. Just like the satellite. We'll rebuild that satellite, President Horkarno. I promise. I know. Thank you, all of you. [barking] You too, Bandit. [whooshing] Melanesia sure is a beautiful country. I do not believe I have seen the best of it, Race. Maybe not this time, Hadji. (Jonny) 'Look at those beaches, and those waves.' I'm telling you, Hadji, next time-- Next time you will not be so fortunate, Bannon. You and Quest have only thwarted me temporarily. We will meet again. And we'll be waiting. Count on it. (female automated voice) 'Welcome to Quest World.' 'Please specify desired data.' 'Acknowledging detailing Quest World Pets.' 'Quest World parameters allow for pets' 'of all shapes and sizes.' 'Ranging from swimming instructors to fire protectors.' 'Quest World pets are completely vectorized' 'and come fully trained.' 'Exercise caution with pets, they tend to smither away.' 'Thank you for accessing Quest World.' [theme music] [music continues]
