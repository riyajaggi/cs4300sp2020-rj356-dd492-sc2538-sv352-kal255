 (male #2) 'We got us a live one, with a camera.' 'I think he's from the ranch.' This is gonna be the worst day of his life. And his last. But make it look like an accident. [intense music] [gasps] [engine revving] [dramatic music] In my sights. Now, keep this bucket still. No problem. bang [tires screeching] bam

 boom swoosh boosh (Doug) 'Hah! That's it, Jonny boy. You got the hang of it.' (Jonny) Are you sure this doesn't hurt them? (Doug) No, they don't feel a thing. [device hissing] I'd rather be breaking in one of those broncos. Maybe next visit, kiddo. Since you only manage to drop by every couple of years I figure you'd be about the right age by then. Well, I hope we visit sooner than that. (Hadji) 'I enjoy this ranch very much.' Yeah, easy for you to say, Hadj. I'm doing all the work over here. [cows mooing] Geez, Grandpa Doug. How many of these cows are there? Only twenty million or so. Oh, great. Black hoof disease is nothing to trifle with, kiddo. - Boss! Hey, boss. - What's the problem, Hank? It's Felipe. He went out to poke around at that dome. Argh! I warned him about.. Okay, how long ago? Before sun up. I can't reach him on the radio. I hope you fellas like choppers. (Jonny) There it is! Yeah, nothing but trouble since they built the blasted thing. [whimpers] How could it be? It is supposed to be a sealed environment. Think about it. It's a perfect place to hide something. (Doug) 'Something fishy going on there.' 'A month after it went up' 'the local Hopi natives started moving from the area.' - 'They say the water went bad.' - Did you test it? Sure did. It's irradiated. My own stock started dying until I got 'em on an alternative water supply. Radiation? Yeah. We confirmed it last night. Reporting at first thing Monday when I get all the evidence together. Hey, I think I see smoke. (Doug) 'Hang on. I'm taking her down.' [phone rings] - Von Romme. - 'It's me, sir.' 'Doug should be at the crash site any minute.' What does he know? 'He's been runnin' some test but I don't think' he's had time to blow the whistle yet. (Von Romme) 'It's not your job to think, farmer Clem.' 'I can't afford to take any chances.' Okay, sir, uh, Mr. Von Romme. I'll, uh-- 'You'll hightail it to the crash site and keep him there.' You want me to take down the old man? Not yet, Mr. Corey. Just fetch him so we can find out if he's been flappin' his big mouth to anyone. You got it, chief. This wouldn't be necessary if your little leak didn't get so much attention. I-I've got a clean-up crew on the spill. Too little, too late, Ryan. I'm sorely tempted to make you clean up your own mess without a radiation suit. [gulps] I'm sorry you guys had to see this. Felipe was a good man. (Jonny) I'm sorry, grandpa. I came as soon as I could, boss. Listen, Hank. I don't think this was an accident. It-it doesn't add up. Looks like he had a blowout and lost control. Nah, I don't buy it. Felipe was too good a driver. - So now what? - Simple. I'm going straight to the feds and demand a full investigation. Sorry, boss. I'm afraid I can't let you do that. How much are they paying you, Hank? Enough. [Bandit barks] Uh, grandpa? Enough chatter. You're coming with us. Sure. As soon as I take care of something. thwack Ah! Okay, now we can leave. (male #3) 'Enjoy the daylight, boys.' It'll be the last you ever see. (Jonny) I've heard that one a few times. [rumbles] [all exclaiming] Ha ha, aw. Did I scare ya? Hey! Wha.. [grunting] Hey, look! A-ah! thud swoosh boom Heads up, Hadj. That was a tough thing you did, guys. - It was them or us, grandpa. - As long as you realize that. Come on, we have to leave before more of those creeps show up. [swooshing] Here they come. Turn off your flashlights and head that way. Quick! You got it. swoosh Von Romme wants the old man taken alive and those kids eliminated if they're a problem. (male #4) 'Hey, come on. I see a light.' swoosh [rumbling] - Huh? - What do you mean escaped? Oh! Ow! It's just an old man and a couple of kids, you idiot. 'Send everything you got.' - Ow! - And get this door fixed. [phone ringing] Von Romme. (man on phone) 'The intruders are spotted in the southeast tunnel.' Good. Make sure you get them this time. Alright, tough guys. You got us. Don't shoot. [snarling] [barking] Keep that mutt quiet or I'll shut him up for you. [whimpering] Bandit! crack - A-ah! - Jonny! Oh-h! thump [grunting] You okay, fella? [barks] Let's go, boy. We have to take one of these buckets down to look for him. Face it, old man. He's gone. Don't worry. You'll be with him soon enough. swoosh [footsteps] (male #5) 'Shipment of processed ores is nearly ready.' Yeah, well, that's the first good news I've heard all day. Von Romme's international customers will have enough high-grade uranium to build whatever weapons they want. Ha! Look, as long as they don't nuke my bank they can use the stuff to build playgrounds. (Von Romme) 'First off, it's important for you to understand' I'm not a nice guy. Not too bright either, from where I'm sitting. Secondly, understand that I'll do anything.. ...anything at all to find out what I want to know. Don't you dare hurt him. Sure thing, old man. Just tell me how much you know about my little operation here. Then tell me what you blabbed to the authorities. Romme, you're personally responsible for what happened to my grandson. You better be more concerned with what I'm gonna do instead of what I know. You have much to answer for. Shut up, kid! The only reason you're still alive 'is to get gramps here to co-operate.' (Von Romme) 'I'll give you two some time to think things over.' They get away again, and the both of you go skinny dipping in the uranium processor. Why don't you find out what they know? Wise up, Corey. They're too steamed about the other kid to co-operate. If I press 'em now, they'll clam up just to spite me. My men're more afraid of me than angry. We'll see co-operation, believe you me. [Bandit barks] Quiet, boy. That boss of yours is some piece of work. He has no respect for anything except his own greed. Ha! You are quite unimportant to him. Shut up! What's so darn funny? [scraping on door] [barking] Ugh! Ah! - Jonny! - You're alive! - We thought you-- - Guys, please. We don't have time for this. That looks like the only way out. Hey.. thwack Intruders. Sound the alarm. [grunting] [glass shattering] [alarm wailing] Let's move it. (male #6) 'Get them!' (Jonny) Get down! (Hadji) Wait here. (Jonny) 'Hadji!' - 'Get him!' - 'Come on..' boom [beeping] boom After them, you idiots. Take jetpack units. I'll take the express freight. - Don't screw up. - I won't, sir. Your life depends on just that. swoosh We've got company. They won't shoot the elevator. - Forget what I just said. - Hang on! boom - Ugh! - Oh! - Are they insane? - They're history. boosh [screams] Automatic! bam - Ah! - 'Hadji!' Hang on, kid. I do not believe these elevators are good for combat. Get ready to move the moment we're topside. They are not getting away. We're too close for missiles. Use your guns. pew pew pew I've had enough! boosh [creaking] (Jonny) Let's go! Ha! End of the line. crash (Jonny) Almost there. Look out! crash boom boom boom (Hadji) 'Very impressive.' Yeah, for a front. zap swoosh After them! (Hadji) This way. zap Keep your eyes open. They're cornered here somewhere. [grunting] crash Take him down. Now! thwack boom - Look out! - Watch out! Step on it. zap zap zap Curse you! Hold still. zap zap zap We gotta jump! boom A-ah! crash [grunts] I wouldn't waste that, even on him. Well, we have more than enough to go on. Our clean-up boys can handle it from here. Hey, guys, look who we have here. (Doug) 'Plenty of chores where you're going, Hank.' - Where is Von Romme? - Over there. Check out the radiation level on this guy. It's gotta be some kind of record. (male #7) 'At least it'll be over quick for him.' (Doug) Well, you kids did alright. Thanks, grandpa. You too. [barking] You tell that egghead dad of yours I think he did a pretty swell job raising you. (Iris the computer) 'Welcome to Quest World Archives. 'Through the work of Jonny Quest and friends' 'Quest World, the consummate laboratory' 'was augmented to create the ultimate virtual reality game.' 'Caution. Escape is recommended.' 'Impending explosion is inevitable.' 'Danger. Enemy speeder ambush.' boom [engine revving] 'Wheelblades activated.' 'Obstacle ahead.' 'Firing cannon.' 'Enemy motorcycles closing.' clang thud 'One bogey on your tail.' 'Alert. Incoming missile has locked on.' swoosh 'Exercise caution when gaming in Quest World.' 'It usually ends with a bang.'
