 Help! Need our assistance, senorita? [sinister laughing] Help me. Unh! Thank you. No, thank you. [sinister laughing] [gasps] [gasps] - 'Jonny.' - Hang on, Jessie. Yaah! Unh! Yenh! Unh! Up to your neck in trouble, I see.

 Good to see you too. Now, how about getting me out of here. [gunshot] [gasps] Huh? Ha ha ha. Heads up. (Jonny) 'Race, look out.!' [intense music] Ya-a-ahh! Dad. - You two, okay? - Mm-hmm. (Race) 'Now, what's going on, Jess?' We fly to Malenque to pick you up, your mother can't find you-- They're after this medallion, dad. [gunshot] [machine gun firing] (Race) Watch out! [intense music] [panting] - Aah! - Aah! [music continues] Just hold on. [laughing] Argh! Dad. Race! No. snap [music continues] Hang on, Jess. [helicopter whirring] The natives do not look friendly, Dr. Quest. Better hit the sonic blaster, Hadji. [zapping] [all screaming] [glass shatters] [indistinct chatter] [music continues] Come on, Jonny, reach. [grunting] Aaah! Hey, nice catch, Jessie, I owe you one. Let's just call it even. [barking and whimpering] [laughing] Hey, who's dog are you anyway? It is only natural, Jonny. After all Bandit hasn't seen Jessie for two weeks. [instrumental music] [birds chirping] Ah, come on, Estella. Couldn't you find a less dangerous place for a mother-daughter vacation? Dad. I come to pick up my daughter, my ex-wife has lost her and I find her chin deep in quicksand. [sighs] I just love it when you play the over protective papa, Race. I suppose, you've never taken her anywhere dangerous? Mom. Besides, the ruins of Malenque happen to be one of 'the pre-Columbian architectural wonders' 'of my country.' - Isn't that true, Dr. Quest? - I agree, Estella. At least you can appreciate how important it is to stimulate a young person's intellectual curiosity. And the Malenque were not only skilled builders as these impressive ruins show, but also years advanced in their scientific and medical skills. Fascinating people. Okay, I surrender. I know when I'm outnumbered. Whatever happened to the Malenque anyway? I am only a policeman, not a scientist. But as far as I know they just died out suddenly. Colonel Salazar, is correct, Jonny. No one knows why the Malenque disappeared. A plague, perhaps. I just wish I could've examined the medallion Jessie found. Well, I've got the next best thing. - A rubbing? - Right. You taught me to always make one whenever dealing with dealing with rare artifacts. I'd just finished it when those creeps started chasing me. How's your grasp of ancient Malenque, Estella? (Estella) '"The mummies have their home beneath the weeping stone.' '"Their tears have come too late' to avoid their wicked fate." I have been patrolling this area for years. No mummies have ever been discovered. Can you show me where you found it, Senorita Bannon? Sure. 'It was behind this crumbled wall.' This frieze depicts the ancient Malenque medicine man. (Dr. Quest) 'They appear to be making elixirs' 'to defeat their enemies.' Unfortunately their enemies still exist. Like the thieves who are constantly trying to steal our ancient artifacts. Dad, I wanna go to the river and wash off. Think you can stay out of trouble for 10 minutes? Hmph. Don't worry, Race, we'll protect her. woof [barking] Wow! No wonder your mom took you here for vacation, Jess. This place is cool. (Hadji) 'Yes, it appears Bandit thinks so too.' woof There you see, those colored boulders indicate their high copper content. Hmm. Mom says there used to be copper mines around here. [Bandit whimpering] Bandit. What is it, boy? [growling] Run! [intense music] [growling] Quick, in here. Whew, he's too big. (Jessie) 'Now what? This is a dead end cave.' Perhaps I can calm his raging spirit. [dramatic music] [growling] I see it, but I don't believe it. You gotta teach me that trick, Hadji. [grunting] - Jess, what're you doing? - Help me. The medallion inscription beneath the weeping stone. [growling] Aaah! So much for cat hypnosis. [growling] Jump! [intense music] - Aaah! - Oh, no! Whoa! [all screaming] Hang on. thud Go, Bandit. Give me your hand. Guess I better see where we are. That was some ride. [rats squeaking] [gasps] Mummies? (Jessie) 'They're mummies of Malenque.' [gasps] [footsteps approaching] Something's alive down here. woof [intense music] How many more of these before that doctor gets what he needs? Who cares! The doctor maybe loco but his money is good. Heh, this is a regular mummy mercoda, eh, Miguel? [laughter] [grunts] Hey, Louis, grab another one. [grunts] (Jessie) We're in one of the old mining tunnels. They must have a way out. Now, if we could just avoid those thugs and their mummy snatching employer, perhaps we can-- Avoid them? I wanna find out exactly what this doctor is up to. I'm right behind you, Jonny. Coming, Hadji? [sighs] Why am I always out voted? Jessie, Jonny, Hadji! Sometimes I wish I had an electronic collar on those kids. Jessie? I tracked them to this cave, but they're not here. Unless. What're we waiting for, dear? I wonder how normal families spend their vacations? [intense music] [indistinct chatter] (male #2) 'Hand me that. Careful!' Aah! Careful, you fool, you could kill us all. Isn't it ironic? Centuries ago my ancestors developed a plague 'to wipe out their enemies.' 'But instead were wiped out themselves.' 'The antidote came too late.' But now, I, one of the last descendants of the Malenque will fulfill the destiny to rule the world. Rule the world? With this? This is fate, my friend. The fate that drove me to become a biochemist. The same fate that led my brother to find the mummies. So I could use their preserved intact tissue to resurrect the plague. No! [coughing] [groaning] (male #2) 'Within one hour he will be dead.' Just a small sacrifice for the good of my people. And now the rest of the world will learn that not only do the Malenque live but live to conquer! Jonny, it is imperative we sneak out of here. - You've got my vote, Hadj. - It's unanimous. clang It's those kids. (Jessie) The cart. [Bandit barking] [grunts] Don't breathe. You fool, the sound might cause a cave in. [intense music] [barking] Bandit, get help. Jonny, I think it's the end of the line. We've gotta jump. Come on! [coughing] Oh, no, Jess. Quick, Hadji, grab an arm! crash It's gonna be okay, Jess. [laughing] [intense music] Aah! Unh! [barking] Thanks for finding us, Bandit. If you're gonna keep saving me, maybe we should get remarr-- Jessie! [Bandit whimpering] Jessie, what has happened to you? Race, do something. Jonny, what's wrong with her? Some crazy doctor cooked up an ancient plague from the Malenque mummies. And she will die within one hour without the antidote. It is in the medallion that Jessie found. - Race, we have to-- - Don't worry, Estella. I'll get it. Race¦! Wait for me. [barking] [gun cocking] Don't even think about it. He's gone, Race, and he's got the medallion along with a whole box full of plague globules. Aah! Went to steal a helicopter. Stop him. Dad's chopper. Colonel Salazar! Boy, are we glad to see you. [panting] We need your help. A mad man has poisoned my daughter and he's on his way-- I'm afraid I cannot help you, Mr. Bannon. You see, that mad man is my brother Dr. Rabel Salazar. We are the last of the Malenque. Aah! Unh! Thanks, Bandit. You'll probably need a rabies shot. [dramatic music] Ow. Dad! I'm alright, Jonny. Just stop them. - Jonny, take the wheel. - Got it! [music continues] Ha ha ha. (Race) 'Not this time, goldy.' Aa-a-ah! Yaaah! [intense music] Argh. [intense music] Unh! [music continues] [grunting] Aah! Nothing will stop me. Do you hear? Nothing. No. Keep your hands off me. Did you think you could stop me? The Malenque will rise again. [growling] Race. 'The mummies are alive.' No, it can't be. It was our own evil that wiped us out centuries ago. We will not let you do it again. Race. (Race) 'Unbelievable.' This place is gonna blow. No. I've got to get the medallion. It's Jessie's only hope. No. [doctor coughing] [laughing] You can't stop me. I have the antidote. What? No. Argh! [intense music] No! [explosion] Come on, Jessie. You can make it. [groaning] Oh, Jessie. (both) Yes. [whimpering] Bandit. No, go ahead, Bandit, I'm not jealous. We're on the same team here. I'm just glad we all made it. [rumbling] (Iris the computer) 'Welcome to Quest World.' 'Please specify desired data.' 'Acknowledged detailing Quest World Pets.' 'Quest World parameters allow for pets' 'of all shapes and sizes.' 'Ranging from swimming instructors to fire protectors.' 'Quest World Pets are completely vectorized' 'and come fully trained.' 'Exercise caution with pets.' 'They tend to slither away.' 'Thank you for accessing Quest World.' [theme music]
