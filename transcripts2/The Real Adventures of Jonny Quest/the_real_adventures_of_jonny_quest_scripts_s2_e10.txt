 [theme music] [music continues] [music continues] (Hadji) 'The weather gods must be smiling.' I predict smooth sailing for the Questor II's maiden voyage. And I am holding you to it, buddy. I predict a delicious lobster dinner in Nova Scotia. [barking] With a doggie bag. - Ready to cast off? - Aye, aye, Captain Quest. [pleasant music]

 [engine revving] [chains jangling] Canada, here we come! [engine revving] [beeping] [whimpers] Wind's coming up. Hadj, you promised me smooth sailing all the way to Nova Scotia. Weather sat is showing a small trough of low pressure. Nothing the new Questor II cannot handle. Yeah, she does steer like a dream. Huh! Well, we wouldn't know. You've been hogging the helm since we left the compound.

 Sorry, Jess. Here you can.. [gasps] Huh? Better let me get us out of this first. Hey, does your low pressure trough include a dense pea soup? Well, the Canadian coast is always unpredictable. Still, this fog is.. [crackling] Ah! Jonny, all my instrumentation is down. Radar, sat-nav, LORAN. Great, I'm sailing blind. I'll hold her on course. You try to get us back online before.. [woman screaming] - What was that? - It came from over there. [dramatic music] Watch it! [engine revving] thud - A-ah! - 'Jess!' [screaming continues] splash [gasps] [ominous music] [barking] Jessie! Jessie! [gurgling] (Jonny) 'Jessie!' Over here. A-ah! Ah! Hang on! [dramatic music] splash Ah! [music continues] [coughs] - Gotcha. - Jonny. - That scream.. - I know. (Jonny) I heard it too. (Jessie) No, I saw her. It was a woman. She jumped into the waves and.. - I'll go back. - No. I tried. She just disappeared. It was as if she wasn't even real. Real or not, better send out a distress call, Hadj. I'm gonna secure the Questor. We are still off-line, Jonny. Could be due to the strange atmospheric conditions. Strange is right. Look at our course. We shouldn't have run aground. [shuddering] Thanks. Well, maybe it is an uncharted island. But we are most definitely here. (Jonny) 'Not for long, guys.' Looks like we only sustained some minor damage. (male #1) You are quite fortunate. The fog this time of year can be quite treacherous. - Is anyone hurt? - No, sir. Good. Welcome to Mornay Island. - I'm Paul Mornay. - I'm Jonny Quest. These are my friends, Hadji and Jessie. [barking] (Jonny) And Bandit. Charmed. We don't get many visitors, regretfully. Mr. Mornay, I saw something out there. It was a woman, she-- I'm the only one who lives on the island. But the fog can play tricks. And then of course, there are the ghosts. - Ghosts? - You're kidding, right? The island has an unsavory reputation with the locals. But you're shivering, my dear. I have a warm fire, up at the manor. Come, unless you're all too frightened? Fear isn't in our vocabulary, Mr. Mornay. Speak for yourself, my friend. [ominous music] So your father investigates supernatural phenomena? I wonder what he'd make of this place. Uh, Dr. Quest always likes to keep an open mind, sir. But most hauntings just turn out to be a clever parlor tricks. Indeed. I wish that were the case here. 'When I first inherited the manor' I too did not believe.. '...that those who meet violent ends can become ghosts.' [whimpering] meow [barking] Even pets. Bandit. arf arf arf [whining] Easy, boy. [tapping] It's solid, Jonny. - That cat is-- - 'Is a ghost.' Ruby once belonged to the lady of the house. Her picture hangs in my upstairs studio. Come. (Hadji) Don't all these manifestations bother you? They did at first. Then I found the tragic history of the island was somehow.. ...inspirational to my work. You're a painter. Uh-huh, when the spirit moves me. [gasps] That's her. The woman I saw in the water. (Mr. Mornay) 'The tragic Lady Caroline.' She jumped from the widows walk almost 200 years ago.. ...to the day. Why? For love, so the story goes. Her fiance drowned at sea, and the heartbroken Caroline could not bear life without him. How tragic. Oh...how romantic. Whatever. Hey, who turned off the heat? Oh, sudden temperature drops often precedes psychic disturbances. arf arf arf Look at that light. It's Lady Caroline. She's beautiful. For a ghost. I think I know how this ends. [intense music] A-ah! She seemed so, so frightened. She will return again and again this night until the dawn puts an end to her troubled wandering. A very impressive display of paranormal phenomena, Mr. Mornay. I wish my dad were here to see it. Hey, there's a new digital video gear in the Questor. Maybe we can capture an image of Lady Caroline. With your permission, of course. Uh, of course. [sniffing] arf meow arf [snarling] arf arf arf meow Bandit! I'll get him. Bandit, come back here. arf arf arf splash [intense music] Easy, boy, I'll get you out of there. Hang on. [intense music] A-ah! Ah! Who is that? [beeps] We better use the night scope. I don't trust the lights in here. Wise call. Can you walk toward the doors, Mr. Mornay? Yes, of course. [whirring] (Jonny) 'Perfect.' 'When Lady Caroline appears, motion detectors will turn on' the camera and send a direct feedback to our computer in that bedroom. Oh, such a waste. You were so young and beautiful. Life would have gone on, even without the one you loved. (Jonny) 'Hey, Jess. How's the digital link-up?' Um, clear as a bell. "Dearest Caroline, you know the hours spent on the mainland "away from you seemed endless. "But soon we'll be together. "I hope the new kitten will ease your loneliness. With all my love, Jean." [gasps] [zapping] Jess, I think Lady Caroline is about to make another appearance. Jess, ready? [Jessie screaming] Jess? thud What are you doing? Jean? No! [mumbling] [Jonny screams] [dramatic music] Argh, argh! [waves lapping] Argh! Nice timing. Where's Jessie? She ran off. Mornay went after her. Something scared her out of her wits. Scared her enough to almost jump. Look at this. Love letters to Caroline from her boyfriend. Now, I'm starting to get spooked. Hadj, let's find Jess. [wind whooshing] [ominous music] Jonny? [Jessie shrieking] Jess? [Bandit barking] Oh, no. It appears we have captured Lady Caroline. 'And she has possessed Jessie.' (Jonny) 'But why?' Perhaps it had to do with those letters from her boyfriend Jean. (Jessie) 'Jean, no!' Jean. That's what Jess called me out there. And look at this. - 'A wisp of fog?' - 'Or another ghost form.' Let's see what the digital image enhancer can do. 'High res close up. Enhancing.' 'There!' [gasps] So Lady Caroline did not jump off the widow's walk. She was pushed! Can you make out the writing on the ring? Freeze frame. Increasing magnification. "L-E-G-E-R." Leger. Come with me. Lady Caroline's fiance, who drowned at sea. 'Jean Leger.' Do you see the resemblance, Jonny? 'No wonder Jessie, uh, Lady Caroline' 'was so afraid of you.' But why would Leger come back to kill the woman he loved? Yes. And what does Lady Caroline want with Jessie? I do not know, but this is my fault. I should never have let your friend come to this house on the anniversary of Caroline's death. Don't blame yourself, Mr. Mornay. But we must find her. Yes. There's no telling what that ghost might make her do. [intense music] Just make sure Jess stays away from that widow's walk, Mr. Mornay. Of course. Be careful. - I will check the Questor. - Come on, Bandit. We'll search this whole island if we have to. [ominous music] [sniffing] What is it, boy? [whining] swoosh meow [barks] Bandit! Argh! Don't you ever learn from your mistakes? poof [whining] Okay, Bandit. You've had your fun. Now-- Jean! I knew you would return. 'It has been a long time since you and I stood here.' Jess, uh, Lady Caroline. Look, listen.. No! You listen, Jean. For centuries my soul has been tossed from the ramparts, because of you! But I'm not Jean. Look, this is all a mistake, you.. 'The mistake was mine, Jean.' Falling in love with a man like you. 'Do you deny you wrote that?' "My dearest Marie." A little shop girl from the mainland. Uh, easy. Look, she.. That girl, uh, look, she meant nothing to me. You said it then, you say it now and you shall say it for all eternity. - No! - Calm down, Jessie. Look, I'm not going to hurt you. [grunting] [barking] [both grunting] This is where you belong, Jean. [mumbling] I'm...I'm not Jean! [intense music] Jonny, Jonny, catch! (Jessie) 'No, you belong here.' (Jonny) 'Ah! Jean Leger?' [gasps] So he did not drown at sea. I always loved you, Caroline. That other girl meant nothing, but you wouldn't believe me. Liar! You betrayed me. You deserve to die in this fog. You left my soul in torment. My vengeful spirit returned to push you to your death. Over and over and over. You must believe me, Caroline. I have regretted it for centuries. - But I was doomed to-- - No! Please! You must end this cycle of spiritual violence and forgive each other. Or your spirits will never rest. The boy is right, Caroline. Time is running out. You have only until sunrise then the nightmare will begin again. Let it end tonight. Oh, Jean. I was wrong to kill you. But my jealousy drove me to the brink of insanity. I loved you. I still love you. Forgive me. [thunder rumbling] Ahem. [both gasps] - Hey! - Hold it! I can, uh, explain everything. It w-wasn't, um.. I know. Me too. Sorry, I overreacted. Yeah. Guess you were just a little preoccupied. Now that I have learned the truth about my ancestor Caroline, I too can finally rest. The fog is lifting. If you want to leave, you must leave now. Mr. Mornay? Wait! [wolf howling] [all gasping] Whoa! Mornay was a ghost too. [wind whooshing] [rumbling] I think he was right about leaving. Let's move! Jonny, where are you going? I'm not leaving without our evidence. Oh, hurry, guys. [dramatic music] (Jonny) Cast off, Jess. - Push.. - 'Push!' splash [engine revving] [beeping] Good news. We are back online. We can call Dr. Quest. Though I think he would have a hard time swallowing this story. But we've got the proof. - What proof? - Why am I not surprised? - Look at the time. - 9 o'clock? Our watches must have stopped right when that fog rolled in. Yeah, time stood still for me too, Jonny. [laughing] Very funny. (Jonny) 'Maybe the whole thing was just a dream.' Maybe. Except for this. The letter that started it all. "Dearest Marie.." Hey! Oh, man. Now we've got zip. (Iris the computer) 'Welcome to the Quest World Archives.' 'Downloading archival footage.' 'Phase 1.' 'Dr. Quest developed the computer system' 'to partially vectorize the human body' 'which he termed hyperrealism.' 'Phase 2.' 'Wire-o-matic stasis.' 'Phase 3.' 'Block mannequin naturation.' 'Phase 4.' 'Cerebral chrysalis.' 'Phase 5.' 'Mellifluous resonance.' 'And finally, phase 6.' 'The fully developed body of current day Quest World.' 'Thank you for accessing Quest World Archives.'
