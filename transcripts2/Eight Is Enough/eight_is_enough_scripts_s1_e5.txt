 Dad, is growing old catching? Oh, yes, very contagious. Does it hurt? At your age, no. At my age, yes. Is that why everybody thinks David's new girlfriend is too old for him. Oh. Well, no, it's just because people feel the man should be older, stronger. How come? Because... - Have you brushed your teeth yet? - Yeah. - Have you washed your face? - Yeah. Go eat breakfast.

 Every time I ask something no one wants to tell me, they say, "Go eat." I'm gonna end up being the fattest, dumbest kid in California. Hey, Tommy, do you believe in God? Yeah. Think he knows everything about everything? Well, he's supposed to. Think he ever does anything about what he knows? Hmm, I don't know. If he knew I was the one who spilled chocolate syrup on the rug... would he do something? I don't know about him, but Mom sure would. It wasn't me. I was just kidding. Tommy. Oh, listen, you, in the kitchen. KP duty. And you, anywhere but here. Quietly.

 Daddy, how long is Mom gonna be on the phone? Sandy Watson's supposed to call me about tonight. Oh. Well, I presume Sandy Watson would know enough... to hang up and call again at a reasonable interval. - What if he calls someone else? - Then he's a jerk. You're better off doing your homework and hoping for a brighter tomorrow. Daisy, now listen, don't forget to mark it down on your calendar, okay? Oh, I know it's exciting, I can't wait. I'll talk to you in a couple of days. Okay, bye-bye. Ooh, she took the bait. And I want all you kids at the party. Every last one of you. Just what did you use as bait? I told her that your boss got us four tickets, four box seat tickets... to the production of Mame. Oh, terrific. Two weeks from tonight, the Maxwells are gonna come here... expecting an extravagant evening on the town. Instead, they're gonna walk into a homesy folksy: "Surprise! It's your 25th anniversary!" Well, Tom, what else was I to say? I mean, she could've canceled out at the last moment. I mean, isn't it a little like promising someone caviar... and then giving them tuna fish signed "With Love"? I got it. It might be... Sandy Watson. Will you tell me something? What did 15-year-olds do before the invention of the telephone? - I think they got married. - Oh. Uh, use the phone as much as you want. What, what? Take your time. Of all the lame... Sorry I yelled, okay? If you're so smart, you turn it over. Go on. Start the bloody thing. If you hadn't been so horn-happy, I wouldn't have stalled. All right, all right. I'm sorry I honked, okay? Why don't you let me give you a shove, so we can get out of this mess? Yeah, yeah, there's a gas station about a mile down. - Sorry I yelled, okay? - Okay. - Sorry I yelled. - Hey, what's your problem? The lady made a mistake. You never made a mistake? Will you take a look at that? Well, the mechanic won't be in till Monday morning. Sorry. You mean you can't fix it? Oh, we don't need a mechanic. We need new distributor wires. I can fix it. I don't carry anything here but fan belts and radiator hoses. Call one of the parts stores. They're closed. Till Monday morning. Oh, for the I... This is the capital of California. You'd think a person could go out without worrying about getting stranded. Well, can I fill her up for you? - What are you looking for? - Cab company. Hey, listen, uh... if you're not married, or, uh, engaged, or, uh, living with a linebacker... or celibate... I'd really like to take you to dinner. Celibate? That is the weirdest line I've ever heard. - I'm starving. - Great. My name's David Bradford. Any relation to the man that writes the column? Just by blood. He's my dad. I'm Jennifer Linden. Pleased to meet you, David Bradford. Even if you do honk your horn a little too quickly. Yeah, it's a character failing. I'm, uh, trying to correct it. Well, maybe you could help. Well, I'll try over dinner. Uh, first, a detour by my place, all right? All right. We don't have much time to get things ready. Would you remind me to call David to make sure he's gonna come? Why don't you just open the door and shout? I saw him doing his laundry out there when I put out the trash. Uh, he was doing his laundry. He just split a few minutes ago. Hey, what do you mean, who split? David. Soon as his shirt and pants dried, he jumped in them and took off. He didn't wanna be late for a game. We're gonna be late. Mary, didn't you tell David we needed a ride? I thought you were gonna tell him. What...? Mom. What...? Oh, Mary. Um, okay, the keys are on the dining room table. - Thank you. - Thanks, Papa. I think we better take a picture of the car. - So we remember what it looks like? - Yes. - You live here all alone? - Uh-huh. There's, uh, an open bottle of wine in the wine rack. Just take me a second to change. You're an artist. No. Just a hobbyist. Really? You know, I bet I haven't ridden in a van in 10 years. It's just as awful as I remember it. Let's go sit down. - So, uh, you're not an artist. - No. And I am not a divorcée collecting alimony, either. And I'm not independently wealthy, and I'm not... All right, all right. Uh, I confess I'm curious. Since by now I've, uh, figured out... that my dinner budget probably doesn't, uh, stack up to yours. I can cook us spaghetti, okay? Okay. I'm a construction worker. I'm an assembly committee consultant... on legislation relating to finance, commerce and insurance. Very impressive title. Are you impressed? Only if you can cook too. Well, hang on to your appetite. Oh, hi, ladies. How was the game? It was great. Uh, David wasn't there. Hmm? No, no, no. I meant, uh, who won? If one of us didn't show up where we were expected... it would register 10 on the Richter scale around here. Amy Vanderbilt would pick silver, she can afford it. What for? Traditional 25th wedding anniversary gift. We have to get something for the Maxwells. Something nice and dignified. Oh, Dad, not too dignified. I mean, dignified's expensive. Tasteful even is probably a little high-priced. I would, uh, suggest appropriate. Appropriate you might be able to afford without cutting back on our allowances. Boy, oh, boy, I never knew you two girls were so centimental. That's centimental with a C. So, what's it like, being in politics? It's terrific, if you can get past all the bull-flinging. And if you're a woman, there are a few special problems. Like? Like, if you're even reasonably attractive... they talk business to the other men... while they try and play footsie with you. You're putting me on. It's real. Believe me. My shoes have the scuff marks to prove it. You don't have to do that. Oh, it comes from being brought up in a big family. You know, uh, every man for himself. How many in your family? Seven, besides myself and, uh, Mom and Dad. Eight, wow. I was an only child. - That's another difference between us. - Yeah. Well, uh, I don't mind being poor, if you don't mind being rich. David, there is a slight difference in our ages. I never noticed. Still don't. Flatterer. I'm over 30. Well, you're not exactly ready for Medicare. I'm 22. Well, I knew there was a difference, I just didn't think it was that much. I never cooked for a man your age. Tell you what. You don't call me "baby" and, uh, I won't refer to you as my old lady. Are we heading for trouble? Tell me to back off, I'll back off. I'm listening. Mr. Bradford... Yeah? You talk too much. Oh, uh, hi, Dave. You're early. Only Nicholas and I are up. That's Tommy. Tommy, meet Jennifer. - Hi, Tommy. - Hi, Jennifer. No Tusch-Bowl for me today, Tommy. We're driving out to West Creek. Hi, squirt. - That's Nicholas. - Hi, Nicholas. Tommy, you know where that spare picnic basket is? It looks like a super breakfast. - Ah, here it is. David and I are going cave exploring. Have you got any advice that might be helpful? Watch out for worms and snakes. - Come on, Jen. - Makes sense. Snakes and worms. I'll remember. - See you later, guys. - Bye, Dave. Hey, that was mine. Tommy, what do you mean you know where David was last night? I just know, that's all. Do we have to guess, or you gonna tell us? You remember those series of lectures they had at the college last semester? You printed up the pamphlets with all their names and pictures. So what? He was with one of them. The one named Jennifer something. With the brown hair and the sexy smile. Jennifer Linden? - Let me see. - Tommy, let me see that. Yeah, she's really foxy, if you know what I mean. Oh, you don't even know what you mean. Yeah. That's her. - Hi, kids. - Hi, Dad. Dad, Dad... what do you think of her? It's David's new girlfriend. Oh. I, uh, didn't know he was interested in political science. All right, now, my point is if we wanna make the Maxwells' party a real success... and not too accessible on the pocketbook then we have to get in there and pitch. Oh, Dad, please not Saturday night. It's a date night. Dad, couldn't you and Mom just take them out to dinner or something? Good idea. We could buy them a real nice card... - and get some flowers. - Yeah. - Absolutely not. - I think Dad's right. The Maxwells are practically family. I think we'll all live. Mary, you're just saying that because you don't have a date Saturday night. Nancy, if I was seeing the guy you've been going out with, I'd consider myself lucky. - Oh, really? - Really. All right, that's very funny. Ha, ha. Okay, now, girls, please fight on your own time. I wanna dish out these assignments. Now, your mother is handling the invitations and the caterer. Mary, you are in charge of decorations. Joanie's on cleaning detail. Susan is gift-wrapping. And, Nancy, you make sure that the crystal and the silver are out and clean. I think he's forgot someone. Who? GIRLS: You. Me? I didn't forget me. I'm paying the bills. Come on, girls. Troops dismissed. - What's wrong with the guy I'm seeing? - Nancy, you're so sensitive about it. Hi, I'm home. Hey, Tommy, I thought you were out hanging 10 with Billy. I was, but, uh, Billy crossed up on a spinner and wiped out... chipped all his front teeth. - Oh, no, that's terrible. Is he all right? - He is, but his father won't be. Uh, explain that. Well, you see, the dentist just took Billy's braces off yesterday. Oh, his poor father. Dad, did you ever go out with older women when you were young? That is a loaded question. Well, I mean, I thought since you might have gone through it... and David's going through it now... it was just a phase I could look forward to. I can hardly wait. Could you give me some tips on how to handle myself first time at bat? Yeah, sure. Dig in, keep your eye on the ball, and don't forget to bunt. Well, I'm serious. You... Don't be precocious with a full mouth of food. I swallowed. Well, there's no subtle way to say this... but, uh, my birthday's in a couple of weeks. I was gonna forget about it. We'll have a party. I'll invite lots of people and send them to the wrong address. Week from Saturday? Every other night I can wring out of you before then? Wring, friend. Wring as much as you want. I think I'm in love with you. Don't say that. It's too soon. Okay. Uh... I think I'm madly in like with you. David isn't home yet. - How do you know? - I just called. I'll bet he spent the whole weekend with her. I'd really rather not talk about it, Elizabeth. Why not? Because this whole male fantasy trip about older women is really infantile. Here. Hey, Nance, tell me more about those fantasies. He's still not home. Oh, honey, you're worrying too much. It's just an interim thing. You know what? You're placing too much emphasis on this whole thing. I mean, men date younger women. Some of them even marry them. But that's different. I mean, women's lib may not approve... but nature has set it up so that men are biologically capable... of reproduction with a younger spouse and women aren't. I think I'll forget you said that. She is not Methuselah. She's not. I just don't understand... how a mature, healthy woman can be attracted to someone David's age. Men can appreciate a firm, young bod, why should women be any different? Of course, I just happen to fall for weekend athletes... with bad backs and graying at the temple, but, uh... Mm. Hi. Mom around? Where have you been? You haven't been home for days. I work, remember? And I moved out so I wouldn't have to clock in. Hey, Dave, before you go in... - will you tell me something? - Shoot. Is it really true what they say about older women? I mean, you know... Tommy, uh, older women are definitely older and definitely women. Anything else is for Hugh Hefner to tell you. Well, the way I see it... state money leads to one thing. State control. If you want your appendix removed... you'll have to make an appointment with your assemblyman. This new malpractice bill is really wicked, Tom. There's some broad in the assembly... who actually believes that what she's doing is right... and if anything, her bill is worse than the last one that bombed out. My insurance rates have tripled in the last year. Tripled. I'm paying more for my insurance than I paid for my home. It's more than I can stand, alone. Nice try. Oh, David, this is beautiful. Where did you find it? I got the glass in a junk store and I made the frame. - Aren't you clever. - Hi, what's that? - Isn't it pretty? - It's a birthday present. - Uh, anybody we should know? - I doubt it. Boy, living in this family is like living in a small town. Well, you can't blame them for being curious. All right. Her name is Jennifer Linden. She's 30 years old. She's involved in politics and works at the capitol... and I think she's the most beautiful woman I've ever met. Thanks, Mom. If you like it, I know Jennifer will. I think she will too. - Bye-bye. - Oh, David. - Yeah? David, honey, uh, did anyone tell you about the Maxwells' anniversary party? No. When? A week from Saturday night. We're sworn to secrecy and attendance. I'm sorry, Mom, that's Jennifer's birthday. I already promised her. Look, any reason I can't spend the evening with you and with Jennifer? - Bring her to the party? - No. I'd really like to meet her. You're terrific. Bye. I tell you, this malpractice bill is putting off a lot more than my putting. The bill is proposed by some woman. Not a doctor, not even a nurse. Probably some closet voodoo queen. She sounds like the Mata Hari of Medicare. I don't like to get worked up over things. Yeah, I can see that. But I would love to get my hands on that Linden broad. I would love to wring her little neck. Linden? - Wait a minute, is that Jennifer Linden? - The same. To have her on my examination table just once... I think I've heard that name somewhere before. You watch out for her, Tom. She could be dangerous. I don't think I should go to this party with you. It's family, I just feel awkward. Why make waves? It's just an appearance. Besides, you're, uh, practically famous in my family. Don't you mean infamous? No, they all know you from that lecture series last summer at the college. Sandy, can you see Mary Ann and Chuck anywhere? She said they might show up. Hey, anyone ever tell you that you look just like The Fonz? Yeah. Everyone. Hey, isn't that your brother back there? What a fox he's got. I didn't know your brother got it on with older chicks. She is one hot number. Shh. Joan, listen, if David shows up with Jennifer... we're gonna lose our best friends. And we're gonna have a war on our hands. If she keeps a low profile... - How do you think our son is gonna react... if I tell him to keep his girlfriend... His woman friend in a corner? With her mouth shut? Now, don't worry. I mean, we still have a few days left. I'm sure you'll think of something. Me? Why me? Well, because you were always much better than me at thrashing things out with David. Besides, lately he seems to be relating better to older women. Thank you. Why can't we go someplace I can afford? Because in spite of my love for spaghetti... sometimes the animal in me craves a good, thick steak. Now, enjoy it. It's my treat. I think my old-fashioned upbringing just reared its ugly head. The man's supposed to pay. Otherwise, he's a louse. Wrong. Now who's self-conscious? Hey. That's nice. A bottle of, uh, Châteauneuf-du-Pape. I have to see your ID, sir. I could've died. The whole movie, all Sandy did was try and play touchy-feely... while he made dumb hints about how much older women know. As if he knew. Like he was challenging me to prove how much I knew. You'd think they could at least have been a little more discreet. It's sick. ELIZABETH: Really. Old enough to be his aunt. I could have just died. You know, I just don't understand how you can blame David, uh... for your friend Sandy Watson being some kind of a shallow creep... with a Casanova complex. I agree with you, Mary. Excuse me, didn't mean to eavesdrop, I was just passing by. Look, I do not condone his love life, but it is his to live. Well, I think his head is screwed on backwards. I bet she even pays when they go out. Elizabeth, our brother is no gigolo. What is a gigolo? What could they possibly find to talk about? Hmm? Well, probably a lot more interesting things than you young ladies are talking about. I really don't believe you. Really. Products of an era of women's lib, my own daughters. Sitting around like a caucus of male chauvinist pigs. Mom, he is our brother and I just think in our own ways, we don't want him hurt. - That's right. - Oh. Sure. Morning. Mind if I borrow your rod and reel? I'm, uh, taking Jen fishing Sunday morning. - Oh. Yeah, sure, that's fine. - Thanks. But, David, about Saturday... Bye, David. Hey, Dad, listen, I've been thinking a lot about this David thing... and I just might have figured it out. See, David is really in love with Mother. - What? - Shh. It's a classic textbook case. An Oedipus thing. He could've been suppressing this for years. But now that he's acting out his fantasies... Please. That's like saying there's a leper in the family, but not to worry, it's curable. That's right. It's curable. Have a nice day, Dad. David. Are you sure you wanna bring Jennifer Saturday night? What's to be unsure of? I've brought dates to family gatherings. Okay. Okay, evade the issue. Mary, I'm not evading any issue. Look, we're not engaged, or going steady, or, uh... We're not even in love exactly. It's hard finding someone you like without everyone meddling... and everything else this family's famous for. You got it? Is she nice? She's wonderful. I borrowed your tackle box too, all right? Sure, no problem. Uh, how is your relationship with Jennifer coming along? Oh, man, not you too. All I did was ask a question. Yeah, you, and Mary a second ago, and Tommy before that. Why don't you just leave me alone? Why don't you stop whining like Nicholas? Stop treating me like Nicholas. I don't live under your roof anymore, remember? I'm entitled to a little more privacy and less third degree. I'm sorry if I offended you, son. Yeah? Well, you've done a good job of it. I just don't like people butting into my life all the time. Full of advice, you could put "Dear Abby" out of business. Look, this didn't start out as an argument, it started out as a pleasant chat. But if... Yeah? Then why don't we chat about something pleasant? If you think that you can talk to me with anything less than simple human respect... we may have more of an argument than you bargained for. What I do is my business, take it or leave it. I don't need your meddling. I don't need your lousy gear, either. David. We'll talk about this later. More bills, from the caterer, bakery. Why does Mrs. Bradford have all the bills sent here? Oh, yes, to allow a sufficient cooling-off period... between mail time and getting-home time. Clever. Mr. Bradford, why don't I hold your phone calls... so that you can make the one that you've been breaking pencils over all morning? Well, it wasn't easy calling you, Miss Linden. Ha, ha. And actually, what I'm about to say... Sit down. Well, what I'm about to say is even more difficult. The point is, I wish you wouldn't come to our house on Saturday because... Mr. Bradford, I think the real point is you don't want me to continue seeing David. No, I didn't say that. No, not in so many words, but I can get the hint. Do you have any idea how difficult it is... to find decent male companionship my own age? If they're not cheating on their wives... they're divorced with three kids on Saturday and guilt feelings on Sunday. Yes, I... Hi. What would you like? I'm not ready yet. I'm sure... I haven't mentioned the mama's boys yet... with more neuroses than psychiatrists' bills. Your David isn't like that. He isn't jaded. He isn't after something. Well, I'm glad to hear that, but that... Look, I was against coming to your party too. David was the one who turned me around. He said our age difference would be old news. I was foolish, Mr. Bradford. I guess I wanted to believe him. Miss Linden, before you go any further let me say one thing... and I won't bother you anymore. My reasons for disinviting you have nothing to do with David. They have to do with a very dear friend of mine... who happens to despise your politics and... Tom. I didn't know you were lunching here today. Uh... Looks like I should have made a reservation. Uh... Yes, it is crowded here, isn't it? How do you do? I'm Jennifer Linden. Dr. Maxwell. Linden? Excuse me, my table seems to have been cleared. Well, that was strange. Yes, uh, that was the friend I was telling you about. I didn't know what to think. I mean, there you were with a woman. I mean, she is rather attractive despite her deplorable politics. You had me worried, Tom. I'm a doctor. I know about these things. Younger women are nothing but trouble. So are older women, depending on your perspective. Then when she introduced herself I thought: "You're kidding." He's interviewing her. My best friend, with my enemy. And all the time, it was just a family crisis. It's a small world, isn't it? And to think it could've gotten a lot smaller. Well, I'll race you. You said we'd talk later. Well, now is late enough. You had no right to call her like that, behind my back. You blew it. Look, I botched it, all right? I'm not apologizing. If you hadn't flown off the handle this morning... and talked to me, the whole thing wouldn't have happened. Dad, do you have any idea how she must feel now? David, try to understand. Max and I go back 20 years. Long, lean years. We struggled together, had sick kids together. Why didn't you use that base and deal with him instead of with Jennifer? All right. Look, David. Do you want me to call her and apologize? No. This whole thing is my fault. I'll take care of the repair work. Dad, I'm sorry about this morning. It's all right. We all make mistakes, son. All right. If you're not going, I'm not going, either. This is getting to be absurd. Look, I really think I overreacted. Your father was very charming. David, it's not just the thing with Dr. Maxwell. I found myself trying to justify our relationship. I've paid my dues. I've earned my own way in life. I don't need to put myself on display for approval. Anyway... I made another date for Saturday night. Not out of spite. I just don't want to cause you any more problems. That's your birthday. We're going to Chubby's. I'll be fine. So will you. - What's this? - I picked it up as our contribution... to the anniversary party. The man at the antique store didn't have any idea how much it's really worth and it... Oh, you're right. I thought if we gave something really exceptional, they'd have to like me. Look, have your parents give it. I mean, it's really a nice gift and it doesn't exactly fit with my decor. You know, we were fine until everyone else started getting into our heads. I know. Goodbye. It's handsome, isn't it? Yes. I'd say it's definitely in the dignified category. I gave Jennifer credit for having the good sense that you seem to be born without. Considering the source, I can ignore that. I was kind of looking forward to meeting her. David, when you go out, who pays? Not that I care. I mean, I'm just curious. You're just nosy. What do you expect, David? All we know about Jennifer is what Elizabeth tells us. She's not exactly one of your fans lately. Honey, um, I can't just accept this. Couldn't we pay Jennifer something? It's sort of her way of making amends for, uh, being so unacceptable. David, listen, I was very impressed with Miss Linden. She's a nice girl. Why don't you have her come over when it's not so hectic? Dad, when is it not so hectic? Everything's pretty cool. I'll be here for the party. It's them. Act very casual. Okay. Hi. DAISY: Hi, Joan. - Oh, is that pretty. - Thank you. Ha, ha. Come on, have a drink. - Okay, sure. Fine. I'd love it. - How are you? Why don't you just stop in the living room a second? - Okay. Everything okay? - Yeah. Yeah? We'll have time for one quick... Surprise! - Happy anniversary! Happy anniversary! - Here's to you, Dr. Maxwell. Daisy, Daisy, look over here, look over here. - Happy anniversary. - Oh, darn it! Come on. - Didn't work? - It didn't work. Hi. WOMAN 1: Congratulations. - Happy anniversary! - Happy anniversary! It's over here. - Perfect. - It's beautiful. That's good. There's the knife. "Happy 25th anniversary to our friends, the Maxwells." Dibs on corner piece. - Make a wish. One wish. Okay. Here we go. Ready? And go. One... - Did you make a wish? - I made a wish. Yes. Yeah. MAXWELL: Now let's see this one. Oh. - Look at that. Look at that. - Let's see it. Do you like it? And I'll say it. You shouldn't have. Oh, I'll say it, we didn't. I think more legislation's decided here in this room... than over at the capitol building. I see much bigger things in your future than committee proposals, love. If I can open a few doors... A little mutual give and take? Hey, lady, wanna dance? Why don't you bug off, kid? The lady has an escort. Do you mind? He's a friend of mine. Nicholas. Nicholas, there you are, you little rascal. I've been looking all over for you. Why? I've been right here. Don't you think it's time you hit the sack? I'm not tired. - It's getting late. - For what? For little boys to be up. Dad, why do grown-ups drink champagne? Oh, that's a good question. Because it's expensive and... No, hey, hey, what are you doing? Ew. It tastes creepy to me. The bar is closed, champ. You've had your limit. You've gotta hit the sack. Go to bed when you're not tired, drink stuff that tastes creepy. Grown-ups. - What's the matter with half-pint? - He's just had too much bubbly. I think so. Dad, have you seen David in the last half-hour? In fact, no. David, he's staring daggers at us. Look, I thought we agreed... It doesn't matter one way or the other how we feel about each other... or whether we see each other again. What matters is, if you don't get rid of that dipstick... and come to the party with me... we'll have knuckled under to a double standard neither of us believes in. It has nothing to do with double standards. - Oh, no? - No, no, it's Dr. Maxwell's feelings. Yeah, over our feelings. We're committed to making other people happy, right? Not ourselves. David, I can't just walk out on him. Okay, then we'll have admitted, openly and freely... that we've done something to be ashamed of. Your politics are wrong, our relationship is wrong... and I'm wrong asking you to be with me. Fair enough? Make up your mind, lady. The iceman cometh. David just got back and he's got her with him. I'm gonna get some cake. Hi. This is the best evening I've spent in years... and your family, the best friends a man could have. Can I give you a hand? Everything's under control. Let's go back and party. - Well, sure. - Okay. - Well, come, join the party. - Thank you. Dr. Maxwell, is something wrong? Tom didn't tell me Miss Linden would... I mean, I didn't expect... I don't know what to do. I can't leave now after you've gone to all this trouble... but I can't go back in there, either. Susan. This is Jennifer Linden. This is my sister, Susan. She's very attractive. Oh, yes, but I feel there's a cloud of war building on the horizon. Dr. Max. Mom and Dad broke their backs to throw this party for you guys... because they love you both. We all do. And your feelings were so important to us that we ignored David's. She's not here to upset you. She's here because David wants her here with him. But she knows that I can't stand what she stands for. And she's probably just as scared meeting you as you are to go out there and face her. Are you ready? What do you say? Come on. - Max, I don't know how to tell you this... - Dad, it's okay. Don't worry about it. - Dr. Maxwell, Jennifer Linden. - Yes, we've met once, briefly. Hi. Happy anniversary, doctor, to you and your lovely wife. Thank you. It is a happy anniversary. Jennifer picked out the statue. - Oh. No lobbying intended, I'm sure. Maybe just a little bit. You know, you two should get together. David tells me you're an artist... and, uh, aren't you and Mrs. Maxwell... co-sponsoring a big charity auction next month? So you're an artist. It's just a hobby. Just a little painting and sculpting. - Lovely. - I enjoy it. - Would you like a little, uh, champagne? - Thank you. - Happy anniversary. - Thank you. - Truce? - Yes. truce. It's been very nice. It was just a surprise. - Was it a surprise? - Hi. - Hey. For what it's worth, I know how you must feel. I mean, I guess it's terrific having a woman like that on your arm. Well, it might have been that at first. The status thing. Now, it's just her. It's funny how things evolve. First, she was the older woman, then the younger woman. Now, she just looks like one of the gang. Yeah. JENNIFER: Hey. What happened to the champagne? It's dry as a desert. - I'll bring it in a minute. - Okay. Sandy Watson was right. She is one hot number.
