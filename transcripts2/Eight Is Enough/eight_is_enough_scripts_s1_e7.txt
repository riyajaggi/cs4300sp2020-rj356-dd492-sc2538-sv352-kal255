 Hi, Nicholas. Elizabeth's alarm clock broke and it's not my fault. Oh, yeah? Well, then, why are you trying to fix it? She said she'd mess up my face if I didn't. Did Aunt V ever mess up your face? Oh, sure. You don't think I was born looking like this, do you? - How did you get even with her? - I put a spider in her bed. The only trouble is, your Auntie V is not afraid of spiders. I bet she's not even afraid of a snake. No, snakes are afraid of her. What did you do to this thing anyway? Nothing. I was playing Bomb Squad...

 and I held it underwater until it stopped ticking. Now, listen, we're not gonna change the way we do things around here... just because we're gonna have a guest. After all, it is my sister and she's family. However, we should get the panty hose out of the bathroom... the skateboards off the stairs... get the trash away from the front of the house. I moved my things, so Auntie V can have her room. We're doubling up. Like one big slumber party. Oh, and somebody better get that tennis sneaker off the garage roof. Tennis shoe off garage roof. Your Aunt V is coming here for a little quiet, so she doesn't want special treatment. Is she coming to live with us? - Just for a little while.

 - Will I like her? - Oh, yes, you'll be fascinated by her. She's a combination of Vince Lombardi and the tooth fairy. If you're lucky, she'll leave a football underneath your pillow. She's rich and beautiful... and she wears black lounging pajamas to breakfast. I remember the last time dear old Auntie V paid us a visit. Ha, ha. Yeah. Mm. I remember too. We were moving, and she put a circus in front of the house. She had four acrobats and a real elephant. She just wanted us to get acquainted in the neighborhood. We got acquainted. With the Police Department, the Sanitation Department. And, wow, look what time it is. Listen, I'm gonna hit the sack. We have a lot to do tomorrow. You should go to bed too. - I wanna watch The Late Show. - In your dreams, champ. In your dreams. It's an airport limo, Dad. It can't be Aunt V. She's not supposed to be here... Tommy Bellybutton! That's your Auntie V, all right. Nobody else ever called me... Never mind. It's a long story. I'll tell you about it later. V? Is that you? Tommy Bellybutton! Oh, it is Auntie V. Oh, are you a sight for sore eyes. You haven't changed a bit, you poor thing. And Mary. No, no, no, I'm Joanie. That's Mary, there. Are you sure? Yes, Auntie V, I'm sure. We have tattoos we check out every morning. - I'm Mary, she's Joanie. - Ha! - Uh, ah! Then, you're Elizabeth? - Right. - And you're Nancy? - Yeah. - And you're Susan? - You got it. Then you must be Tommy. - And you're Nicholas. - Yep, I am. Oh, listen, Tom, pay the man, will you? All I have is that tiresome lira and nobody knows what it means. Sure. I've got all these American dollars and everybody knows what that means. Oh, Daddy. Let's all go inside. I'm famished. It's breakfast time. Breakfast? VIVIAN: What have you been doing? Breakfast time? Oh, my. Oysters and eggs. Libido power. Oh, gosh, that's just what this family needs. - Mary, where's the Tabasco sauce? - I'm Nancy, Auntie V. And it's on the counter. - Ah. I will never understand why your father gave you such ordinary names. Now, if he'd listened to me, you'd all be Adriennes... and Valeries and Roxannes... Roxanne Bradford. That would've made a great stage name. Tom, you didn't tell me you had an actress in the family. - No, Joanie studies drama in college. - I'm gonna direct a play next spring. I always found the performing end of the theater to be the most exciting for myself. - I worked on Broadway, you know. - On Broadway? Well, what's a few blocks? Auntie V, what does the V stand for? The V stands for Vivian, darling. Vivian Bradford Davis Poletti Von Manfred. Wow, three husbands? Three that I'll admit to. Your Aunt V is just being very flip. She does not take marriage that lightly. In fact, how is he? It's Horst, isn't it? Uh, yeah. Horst is in, uh, Switzerland at the moment. Some kind of international banking venture, I think. Whatever happened to that play you were gonna write? Daddy, you never told me you wanted to be a playwright. Oh, just one of my teenage dreams, sweetie. Don't disparage dreams, Tommy Bellybutton. - Bellybutton. - Daddy. Don't start calling me Tommy Bellybutton, I'll never hear the end of it. - It needs beer, I think. - Yeah. We're all gonna have a lot to dream about if we eat that stuff. Nightmares. Those who dare, do. You should each have a dream, a goal. It's the only thing that separates us from beasts of the field. Oh, I've got a dream. I'd like a CB base station. Go get a job. That's not a dream. That's a... That's an item. A stepping-stone. I'm disappointed in you. Doesn't any one of you have a lofty dream? - Skydiving. That's what I wanna do. - Ah! Skydiving is insane. It's a sport, Daddy. Oh, come on, skydiving is a sport the way Russian roulette is target practice. It's not as risky as jumping a motorbike over a river. All right, quiet about that. A motorbike? Would you believe that your father was once the Evel Kneivel of his day? No. Daddy? I'm so lucky I didn't break my neck. It's those who dare who do. You know, it's easy for you to talk... you're gonna leave here, then I'm stuck picking up all the pieces. Well, all I know is that people should dream and dare... and be as wonderful as they can be. Mary, we haven't heard from you. What's your dream? My dream is not to be suckered in by oysters and eggs... in the middle of the night. Oh, good morning. - What are you doing here? - Typing an ad. - What are you buying? - Nothing. - Then what are you selling? - Me. I got laid off. How do you spell "industrious"? - "Hard working" is how I would spell it. - Better. - Well, how long will you be laid off? - They don't seem to know. Your Auntie V arrived last night, you know. Yeah, I do know. How? She just got here last night. Simple. She called me this morning from her car. - Again, please. - She called me this morning from her car. - But your Auntie V doesn't have a car. - She rented one. She rented one with a telephone? With a phone. She called me to invite me over for dinner tonight. She's cooking dinner? - Did she say what we were having? - Nope. Though she did ask if anyone in the family was allergic to eel. I better get this in. Well, I'm sorry that you got laid off, David. Yeah, me too. If I was working, I could afford to turn down the free meal. See you tonight. Eel? - More blue. - Don't you think I have enough on? You can't be too thin, too rich, or too attractive. I know that's blasphemy in this day and age of women's lib, but it's the truth. - You think you're liberated, Auntie V? - Of course I am. But I'm just too smart to think that being equal means being the same. Vive la difference! Mary would say, "All this makeup is catering to infantile male fantasies." Well, it seems that Mary and I don't see quite eye to eye on a number of things. For instance, what did she say about your skydiving? I don't really think she has anything against me going skydiving... but she doesn't think I ought to unless Dad says okay. Oh! So unless you have approval... of the dominant male figure in the household... you are not free to express yourself as you wish. Now, how liberated is that, hmm? Really. Oh, Auntie V, this is really special. You can borrow it sometime, if you like. - Really? - Yeah. For the tryout tonight? If you wear that, you'll be a shoo-in for the lead. It's not the lead, but it's a good part. When you're dedicated, you take anything you can get. My first role was just a walk-on... but I used to thank God every day that I was a part of the theater. Tell me about this company. Well, they're on tour here for six days and then they move on. But the ingénue walked out on them. My drama teacher recommended me to the director. Experience, that's the real teacher. I dropped out when I was 17... and ran away with a boy my parents didn't approve of. Eventually, we found ourselves in New York City... and I was drawn to the spotlight like a moth to the flame. You take that and wear it to the audition tonight... as a talisman of good fortune. A family tradition of creativity carried on from me to you. - Thank you, my lady. - You're welcome. One, a bill for 12 pounds of smoked eel. Lots of luck. Two, a bill in advance for a week's rental from the Klassic Car Rental company. And three, my report card from last term. Why am I looking at your report card? Because I got a C in Introductory Philosophy. The only C on the card. Mary. You know, when I was a kid and I tried that stunt on the motor bike... I broke both ankles and fractured my kneecap. The doctors told my folks... that I would come out of it with a very pronounced limp. Well, as you can see, I do not limp. I do not limp because my sister Vivian worked with me eight to 10 hours a day. She wouldn't let me quit, no matter how much I begged her. You see, you know her as a flighty, erratic, slightly maddening lady... but I remember her as Vivian, the girl who wouldn't let me quit. She's family. And I'm not gonna do anything to hurt her. I understand that, Dad... but we're family too. Geronimo! - Hi. - Hi. Geronimo! Why? Oh, hi, Mary. I'm getting a tan in a hurry. - Why? - Because Auntie V says... models are supposed to have healthy-looking tans. Ah. Is the beautiful dreamer inside? She took Nicholas and Tommy shopping. - Shopping for what? - "Dreams," she said. Geronimo! Yeah. Why is it I feel that I may have forgotten to play golf with you this afternoon? Because you have. Oh, gosh, Greg, please forgive me. In the middle of the night, my sister came in unexpectedly. Lord knows what time we got to bed. Precisely the reason you should take the afternoon off. If your sister's the problem you've been telling she's been all these years... you're gonna need all your strength. Strength is found on the golf course. That is this doctor's prescription. Yes, but you're not my doctor. Picky, picky, picky. Come on. Let's go to your house. Change clothes, check on your sister, and have time for nine holes of golf. I don't have to change my clothes and I don't have to play golf... but I do have to check up on my sister. Okay... Thanks, Auntie V. I'll go plug this in and we can talk to truckers... and see who's got their ears on. That's exactly what I've always wanted to do. I think. Come on, Auntie V. Let's go shoot some baskets. Come on. Hey, wait for me. Come on now. Okay, let's see you make one. Super. Oh, Nicholas, it's my turn. Geronimo! Watch this. Geronimo! I am very impressed. Permission or not, Auntie V, I am ready to do it. I'd be out there now if I had some wheels. Susan, I just rented some wheels. Yeah? You wanna watch? - What are we waiting for? - Well, let's go. - Oh, boy. - Ha-ha-ha. This basketball works good, Auntie V. You keep practicing. - Where are you going? - To the airport. I certainly hope no one thinks I influenced you. What is this? Truck, Tom. Big truck. - Roger. - Okay, good buddy. You eyeball that county mountie in the plain wrapper by the Edgemont turnoff. - Over and out. TRUCKER: Nice, little buddy. Over and out. Tommy, what's going on here? Hi, Dad. How do you like the new CB setup? Oh, no wonder the front of our house looks like Tony's truck stop. Oh, that's old Homer the Roamer. He needed a spot to get some shuteye. He's gonna take a shower later. Did you lose a bet? Did Auntie V give you the money for this? She didn't give it to me. It was more like a loan. I'm gonna pay her gradually. I'm gonna tell you something. First of all, turn that thing off and keep it off. You're supposed to have a license for a rig like that. - But, Dad. - Second, get Homer the Roamer out of here. We don't want semitrailers parked in front. Third, I'm gonna have a talk with Auntie V. Where is she? She and Susan went to the airport. - Aha! She's leaving. - I don't think so. Susan had her skydiving helmet. No, she had her skydiving helmet... Skydi... Oh, no. Oh, Lord. Is there a Halloween for grownups? Tommy Bellybutton, you're just in time. - Tommy Bellybutton? - Where is Susan? About 3000 feet. Oh, no. I can't believe that you'd let her do such a thing. Give me that thing. Susan, get down here this instant! I think that's her plan, Tom. Tom, don't panic. This is Susan's instructor, Leonard. Well, I'm Susan's father. What good are you doing her down here? They don't like us jumping with casts. Oh, nice plaster work. What happened? Even pros have occasional bad landings. Look, I want this thing to stop right now. This is nonsense and I want it to stop now! Mr. Bradford, try to understand. This is a highly specialized sport. Every precaution has been taken. Even if something happens and Susan's main chute fouls... she has a reserve chute packed by a licensed rigger. And if she uses it, she has to pay the man who packs it a case of beer. Isn't that cute? Ha! - What if the reserve doesn't work? - Then the rigger owes her a case of beer. Please, don't worry. I've already made out her certificate. - What kind of a certificate? - Jump certificate. Look. She's climbing out on the wing. Oh, no. Stand by. Go. Aha! A piece of cake. The wind's changed direction. - Huh? Turn left, Susan. Left. More left. Yeah, she's drifting off target. Toward the fence. Well, help her! Help her! I did it. I did it. I did it! All right! Wasn't it divine, Susan? Didn't you just love it? Did you see me? Did you see me? I did it! Yes, you did it, all right. You defied gravity and you defied me. Oh, but, Daddy, I really did it. - Aah! - What's the matter? Daddy, my ankle. It's okay, honey. It's okay. Take it easy. There's a doctor in the house. Yes, I wish that's all we had in the house. More squid sushi, anyone? I've hit my limit, Auntie V. - Where did you get this stuff? - Oriental food is very healthy. I never travel without my wok. It's okay to walk when you're older. But I'd rather travel with my skateboard. Oh, my back is killing me. I tell you, I feel like I fell off your skateboard. Don't worry. Susan will loan you her crutches. Everybody forget about it. It's just a little sprain. It's not what you got, it's the way you got it. Daddy, I broke my leg learning to ski, hit my nose playing softball... jammed my finger playing basketball. This is nothing. A 3000-foot jump is nothing? No, it is a very big something. Now, her ankle will heal in a week. But her memories will last forever. So will Dad's anger. Oh! David, I understand you have joined the ranks of the unemployed? Bad news travels fast. Don't despair, dear. I have a friend in architectural design who may take you under his wing. Well, I'm more of a builder than an architect. Keep your sights high and keep in mind what I said. I shot 10 baskets in a row today with my new basketball. - Oh, yes, that reminds me, Vivian... - Uh-oh. Whenever your father calls me that, he is serious. When he was little, he couldn't say Vivian. That's how V for Vivian was born. Isn't that cute? I am serious, so don't change the subject. Now, the point is, Vivian, I don't want any more of this expensive gift giving. But, Daddy, Auntie V was gonna get me that party dress I wanted. Nancy, in this house, we have to work for luxuries or we don't get them. Don't worry, we'll work something out. - Vivian! - Work. Work. She'll earn it. I got it! I got it! I got it! Oh, I'm so glad. I knew you would. Well, I'm glad somebody around here got a job. It was Auntie V, really. She helped me, she coached me, and she loaned me her lucky brooch. Well, I hope you will remember me in your first Oscar acceptance speech. How could anyone forget her? Oh, Auntie V, guess what. The director said that if it works out with me... there might be a permanent spot for me in the company. That means you'd have to travel with them. The smell of the greasepaint... - the roar of the crowd. - Roar of the crowd. Wait, Joan, I thought you were gonna go to college for two more years. That play you wanted to direct? Well, one problem at a time, right? I mean, he hasn't even offered it to me yet. Oh, he will, dear. My, isn't it nice to have so many choices? Well, let's hear it for our star. - Right, Joanie. - Yay. Star! Star! You know, Nicholas, this takes me back a lot of years. I can remember tucking your brother David in when he was your age. Only he didn't have so many freckles. Auntie V, how come you don't have any kids? Heh. I guess it's because... they could never compare with your daddy's kids. - Gee, I never thought of that. - Ha-ha-ha. Good night, angel. Auntie V? You can tuck me in any time. I'd like that, Nicholas. Till I'm bigger, I mean. Oh, yes, of course. What could be so wrong? Fathers. Sometimes Dad's so straight, you'd think I was still a child. What gives? Daddy absolutely refuses to let me wear the makeup you gave me. He said someone my age shouldn't be trying to look like someone your age. Oh, he did, huh? Turn around, let me look at you. Come on, turn around here for a minute. Oh, I think you just need a little more practice with your face. Makeup should enhance your features, not hide them. Come on, I'll show you how. Come on. When we do it right, your father will love it. - You really think so? - Trust me. I know so. And I know just the time we can try it. Good evening. - Where's the party? - Right here, sir. - What? - Will you be staying long? I doubt it. - Welcome home. - This is not my home. I waited for the other shoe to fall. I didn't think it was gonna be a combat boot. - Surprise! - Surprise! Surprise, that's an appropriate word. Vivian made us promise not to say a word, Tom. I've been chatting with her all evening. She is a remarkable woman. Oh, I wish V would give my big sister a few lessons. All Grace ever does when she visits us is watch TV and eat doughnuts. Some people have all the luck. If you're in the mood for surprises, there are a few others. Oh, and if I'm not in the mood? Better get into it quick because here comes surprise number one. - Very glamorous. - Thank you. Nancy, I thought I told you... I earned every penny for this dress, Daddy. - I hope you can tell me how. - I can do better. I can show you. Auntie V helped me get this modeling job over at Dellwoods. I never dreamed it would be in the latest edition. - Isn't that a cute bikini? - What there is of it. My own paper, and they never even told me. - Let me see it, Tom. - No. Come on, I'm a doctor. Well, then you can afford to buy your own paper. Here comes surprise number two. - Listen, if I tip them, will they go? - Uh-uh. I tried it, it doesn't work. I'm gonna go show off my new dress. Come on, Daisy. - Hey, Dad. MARY: Hi, David, you're late. And Auntie V is looking for you. - In a sec. Dad, I think I got a job. - Really? That's good. With a friend who's building this place on weekends. Not much bread, no overtime, but it's work. I'll be able to pay the rent. David, there you are. I've been looking all over for you. I have the most wonderful surprise. - Let's see, number three. - Great. I love surprises. I spoke to an architect friend... and talked him into taking you on as an apprentice. - An architect? - Not just any architect. The best. Oh, it's a wonderful opportunity, David. He'll even pay you while you learn. Someday there are going to be David Bradford buildings all over our skyline. Heh. Well, I said I love surprises. Well, we'll settle the details later. Right now, I have got to take care of the champagne. So how do I get out of this one? I don't know. This is something you have to work out for yourself. If you can get anywhere with your Aunt Vivian... please let me know how you did it. Hi, Daddy. Well, I recognize the voice, but I can't place the face. Let's see, surprise number... I lost count. Yeah, I've got a surprise for you. Go upstairs right now and wash that face. Dad, Auntie V wants us all in the living room. She says she's got a surprise for us. I don't know about this one. Attention, everyone. Attention. Attention. May I have your attention, everyone, for just a moment? Thank you. I would like to have you meet Mr. Dale Travers... of the Travers Repertory Company. He has a very important announcement to make. Dale? Thank you very much, V. Be careful when you give an actor center stage. I may just go on and on and on. But seriously, our company has enjoyed its visit to your fair city immensely. Among other reasons because it's given us a chance... to meet a very beautiful and talented young lady with a great future... Miss Joanie Bradford. I regret to say that we'll be leaving shortly to continue our tour. But it gives me great pleasure to announce that when we do... Joanie will be joining us as a permanent member of our company. All right, that's music and champagne for everyone. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Thanks. Oh, Auntie V, thank you. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Joanie, don't we talk things over anymore? I wanted to tell you privately, Dad... but Auntie V thought it would be more fun to save it for the party. Yeah. She has got a flair for the dramatic. Well, you have to admit, it's an incredible opportunity. I thought we agreed that you were gonna finish school. But I can always finish school. I might not have another opportunity like this. Leaving your family, doesn't that mean anything to you? Of course it does. I'll miss you all very much. But it had to happen sometime. You're old enough to lead your own life. I mean, I can't stop you. But I can tell you if I think you're making a mistake... and I think you are, a big one. Why don't you wait a few days, and then maybe you might change your mind. I've already made it up, Dad. Excuse me, I found these on the sun porch. I guess Auntie V's caterer must have missed them. Has everyone left? Well, everybody except for Auntie V and those theater people. They're going dancing. Sounds like you don't approve of my new job, Mary. I think you're crazy. It's just great having your whole family backing you. What a fabulous party. Everybody had the most marvelous time. Not everyone. TOM: Mary. You know, Mary, sometimes I get the idea that you don't quite approve of me. Oh, Auntie V, as a child, I adored you. I even wanted to be like you. But now, my approval or disapproval is no big deal. What's happening to this family is a very big deal. I guess your visit just brought out the worst in all us. - Mary, please. - And I guess I'm no exception. I don't usually act this rudely to houseguests. Excuse me, please. I'm sorry, V, it's just that Joanie's news has been quite a shock to all of us. Well, of course it has... but we should be happy for her and celebrate her good fortune. The evening has just begun. Are you coming, Joanie? Go on, Joanie. - Mary... - Dad, I know your feelings about Auntie V. How you don't wanna hurt her, and why. But if you don't do something now, it's gonna be too late. And if I have to hurt her... I have to hurt her. Good morning. Good morning, Nicholas. You're sure up early. Couldn't sleep. Are you really planning to go away? You bet I am. Don't you think I should take advantage of my big chance? Yeah, kind of. But I kind of wish you wouldn't too. - Well, why don't you think I should go? - You tell stories better than anyone else. You act them out for me. I can act them out for you. Yeah, but you won't be here forever. Oh. No, I guess you're right. There's your father, impatient as ever. I gave him so many surprises last night... that he promised me a surprise of my own today. Oh, don't pack too much. You'll be amazed at all the new things you can pick up on the road. I'll see you later. Here, help me pack, okay? Hi, folks. Ha! David, is this your office? Why not? Lots of fresh air, the smell of wood. The smell of good hard work. Well, not quite the same as a high-rise in New York with your name on the door. No, as you can see, my office doesn't even have a door. Here, I'll show you around. Well, is this what it looks like before the wallpaper is hung? Just open spaces and plenty of studs. - Why, you terrible child. - No, no, these studs, Auntie V. Hardly my type. They're the skeleton of this building. They're what's underneath the design that your architect dreams up. They're put here by guys like me who like to work with their hands... find satisfaction in making a structure come to life... true to the plans. On the level, if you know what I mean. That's what I am, Auntie V, a craftsman, and I'm proud of it. That's what I want to be. Maybe someday I'll have a construction company... but for right now, this is a good life. Honest, physical, important. Even this job, it pays less than I usually get... but I'd take it with no wages rather than be chained to a desk. You dig? I dig. I won't say I'm not disappointed. What am I gonna tell my friend? Tell him to design you a house. When you need a good builder, I just might wanna do business. I just may do that someday. Settle down. Well, I gotta get busy. Thanks for coming. One of the worst things that parents can do, I think... is to try to live their life through their children's lives. I have to keep pinching myself once in a while... so that I don't fall into that trap. You love the children like they were your own, so... Please don't do that to them, V. Please let them live their own life. Uh... I think, under the circumstances... I'll be leaving tomorrow, after Joanie goes. Why don't you stop running, V? - What do you mean? - You've come to visit me twice. Both times you were breaking up from a husband. I didn't think it showed. I don't mind your seeking refuge here. The only thing I mind is your trying to shape us up... to be what you want us to be. I'm never gonna be a famous playwright. David is happy building houses. Why can't you accept us the way we are and let it go at that? And Joanie? It's probably too late now for Joanie to change her mind. I only hope that you can face her if everything doesn't work out all right. It's what she wants. Isn't it what you want, V? Yeah? It's me, dear. You all packed? You don't seem very excited. Oh, I am. Really. It's just that I've, uh... had another talk with Dad and he still doesn't want me to go... although, he's not gonna stop me. I'd say you were a very lucky girl. You see, when I wanted to leave, your grandparents said, "Absolutely not." Of course, I went anyway. But it would've been nice if they'd agreed. I have something for you. Oh. I'm sorry, Auntie V. I can't accept that. I have a confession to make. No, I have a confession to make first. I know this is gonna let you down, and I'm sorry. But I've thought about it... I mean, I've acted it all out in my head and everything. I'm sorry, Auntie V... but I just can't go out on the road. I'd be making a giant mistake. There seems to be a lot of that going around. - Well, you said I had some talent, right? - Mm-hm. Well, if it's true, then, with a little luck, it will still be true later. What I won't have... later... is this family... the way it is now. I guess I have to finish this play... before I can go on to another one. - Please try to understand. - I do, I do. I do understand. That's my confession. I want you to take this anyway. Because it's liable to come in very handy someday. - Oh, thank you, Auntie V. - Ha-ha-ha. Don't you thank me. We all make our own luck. And right now, I'd say you're on a winning streak. - Hi. - Oh, Susan. Hey, look at that. No more crutches. I'm a fast healer. - You ready for your next jump? - Oh, no, Auntie V. I may be a little crazy, but I'm not a fool. I don't make the same mistake twice. I mean, it was really fun and everything, and like you said, I'll remember it forever. It's just I don't wanna risk my forevers on a jump. Your father is in his study. I'm sure he'll be very happy to hear that. Yeah. I wonder what he'll think about my new sport. I'm getting into motocross. Next week's my first race. I wonder what he's gonna think about that. Ah, hello, Mr. Bradford. Is Joanie ready? Just a second, Mr. Travers. I'll see. Oh, V, would you tell Joanie that Mr. Travers is here. - That won't be necessary. - What? We had a talk and everything is all straightened out. I don't understand. Joanie's not going! Wait a minute. I thought we had an agreement. I'm sorry, Mr. Travers, but it looks like Joanie has a prior commitment. - But, Mr. Bradford... - Thank you anyway. Have a nice trip, and break a leg. - We mean that. - Let's help unpack. I was hoping she'd go. Even up the boys and girls around here. You know something, V. For a big sister, you're not so bad. Not so bad, not so good. But always Auntie V. Sure saves on red caps. Thanks for sharing them with me. Oh, thank you, V. They'll never forget what you gave them. - I wish it could have been more. - I don't just mean things, V. I mean, a zest for life... an appreciation for style... a desire to do things. You know, little brother? It's nice having you for a big brother too. - Give my regards to Horst. - I will. Tell him to shape up. Big brother will be watching. Auntie V, can we watch your plane take off? Of course you can... With your father's permission. - Sure, have fun. - All right! Yes! You know, it's... It's gonna be awfully quiet without you around. Around here, that's really saying something. I love you. Okay, we're off. Bye. See you on Monday? - Yes.
