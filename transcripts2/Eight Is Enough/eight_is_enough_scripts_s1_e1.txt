 TOM & MAXWELL O! say can you see By the dawn's early light What so proudly we hailed At the twilight's last gleaming Whose broad stripes and bright stars Through the perilous fight O'er the ramparts we watched Were so gallantly streaming? And the rockets' red glare The bombs bursting in air Gave proof through the night That our flag was still there Mom, sometimes when Daddy and Dr. Maxwell do that, I could just die. Oh, every now and then, you can put up with it. It's family tradition. Other families get reunions or old-time recipes for their traditions.

Over there. Break. ALL: Break. Hut one, hut two, hut three. Okay. Go. JOAN: Come on, Tom. Come on. Come on, Tom. Goals are down there. Oh, Tom. Hurry up and throw the dumb thing. Hey. Where were you throwing that thing to? I was wide open. You were not wide open. Danny was coming in on you and he would have intercepted... if I had not known enough to throw the ball away. Yes, yes, yes, throw the ball away. The same thing that Sonny Jurgensen knew how to do so well. - Yeah, he knew when to retire too. - Ha-ha-ha. Too much time in the huddle. You're telling me. Mother, nobody wears a bra anymore. Really. Elizabeth, you are gonna wear a bra, and that's all there is to it. Daddy? I hear a voice in the wilderness. What do you want? Do any of the young secretaries down at the newspaper wear bras? How would I know, sweetheart? I'm a married man. Daddy, you're not blind. I ain't dumb, either. I'll be on the porch. Elizabeth. - Where's Joan? - She just went upstairs. She's trying to extinguish a burning bra. - Another drink? - No. I'm fine. - Dad, I'm going down to the Pit. - Oh. Good, enjoy. Listen, tell me about Dave Harris. How is he coming along? Oh, good. Well, as far as I know. It wasn't what you'd call a major coronary, Tom. - It was more a warning kind of thing. - I know, but knowing Dave... - Going to Johnny's. - Be back by 9:00. Yeah, yeah. Knowing Dave, knowing that he's such a driving kind of a guy. He was so uptight about everything. I think he ought to take it easy. Dad. I'm going to the show. What show? TOMMY: Brother Blood Sucker. - That sounds R. - It's G. No kidding. Take a silver bullet and call me in the morning. - Okay. - Dave is so nervous. And from what you read about the effect of tension on the heart... - Nancy's coming with me. - Oh. Thank you, thank you. Anybody as nervous as Dave, I would have to think... that he should really rethink his whole way of reacting to everything. Don't you think so, shouldn't he? I haven't the faintest idea of what we're talking about. About Dave Harris and his heart attack. What else? Oh, Dave will be fine. As long as he never has occasion to set foot in this house. Ha, ha. What are you talking about? She's wearing a bra, not wearing a bra? It's a compromise. Not wearing a bra... but neither is she wearing that blouse. She's going topless. Clever. No, no. She's wearing her Washington Redskin T-shirt. Anyone who would make a pass towards George Allen's nose... is no friend of democracy. Why shouldn't Dave Harris come to my house? Well, it's just that it's a little hectic, Tom. I don't see how you ever remember their names. Never try eating nectarines since juice may dispense. - I beg your pardon? TOM: Never try eating nectarines... since juice may dispense. Never, Nicholas. Try, Tommy. Eating, Elizabeth. Nectarines, Nancy. Since, Susie. Juice, Joanie. May, Mary. Dispense, David. It never fails. Hardly ever. Well, our oldest two are married and on their own now. Believe you me, that takes some getting used to. - I can hardly wait. - Oh, I bet. Oh, just listen. Listen to what? The silence. The absolute silence. It's terrific until you get used to it. Then it's not so terrific sometimes. - I'm sorry. - Hmm? - For what? - Filing my nails. - I know you don't like that sound. - Oh. Thanks for the consideration... but the fact of the matter is... it bothers me less and less as the years go by. I suspect I'm growing deaf. Oh, don't be asinine. - What? - I said you're not growing deaf. The country's not going to the left. Anything but. Hello? Yes, this is Mrs. Bradford. Thank you, officer. We'll be right there. - Who? - Elizabeth. - What? - Possession of narcotics. Damn. It's just so super dumb. Just unreal. Unfortunately, it's very real, Elizabeth. So tell me about it. Slowly and without any editorials. Okay. - We were coming down Central Avenue... - Who is we? - Me and Stanley. - Go on. Anyway, we were coming down Central Avenue... and Stanley went through the stop sign at about a 100th of a mile an hour... and this pig on a motorcycle was hiding behind... Now, just hold on. If you wanna enlist my sympathies at all... you better start out by telling me about this man on a motorcycle... or this officer on a motorcycle or this guy on a motorcycle, whatever. But if you go on calling this motorcycle man a pig... your old dad is going to have a hard time rooting for the home team. You always call yourself old Dad when you wanna be charming. - Do I? - Yes, you do. It's really super dumb, Daddy. Let's debate my personality some other time. You're in jail, I'm not. Oh, Daddy. It's not jail. It's just JDH. Juvenile Detention Hall. - Elizabeth. - Tom. Tom, go ask the desk sergeant if we can get Elizabeth out of here by tonight. - You're so much better at this than I am. - Oh, yeah, all right. I'll be right back. I'm sorry, but I don't think I did anything wrong. Well, if that's the case, Elizabeth, then you have nothing to be sorry about. Now, you ran a stop sign. The policeman pulled you over. Next. Officer Reardon observed the suspect vehicle failing to heed a stop sign... at the intersection of Central and Western. He halted the suspect vehicle at the intersection of Willoughby and Central. As Officer Ryan approached the vehicle... he observed the driver and passenger engaging... in an attempt to hide some object under the front seat. Lord. Mom, I didn't even know he had the junk in the car. I mean, I knew he smokes pot... everybody smokes pot, but I didn't think he was doing pills. When he started shoving the stuff under the seat... well, what was I supposed to do, make a citizen's arrest? I mean... when did I get to be Goody Two-Shoes? - Never. - Officer Reardon... acting on probable cause, instituted the search of the suspect vehicle... and located a clear plastic bag containing... Skip the containing. I'd rather not know just now. Mom, listen to me, I mean it. I never would've gotten in the car if I knew he had that kind of stuff. Amphetamines are a bummer. I know that. Amphetamines are a felony? Boy, I didn't know that. Your daughter's not just charged with possession. She's charged with obstruction. She tried to hide stuff from Officer Reardon... with the kid who was driving. That's the felony. Well, what kind of a fall does that have? What's the possible penalty? Oh, I'm not supposed to say so... but first offense, she might get off with a token sentence. How long would that be? Six months. Not more than a year. - Where's the phone? - Outside the entrance there. Hello, Sam. It's me, Tom Bradford. I'm sorry to call you so late, but I... Our family has some legal problems that I'd like to talk over with you. Bad night, huh? It was a terrific night, it's just a bad morning, is all. Where is the reefer fiend? - Dad. - She wanted to sleep in late... so I said she could. I don't suppose I have to fill any of you in on our little adventure last night, do I? Is there gonna be a trial? Well, hopefully not. I called Sam Bostleman and he is going to arrange... at one hell of a legal fee, I'm afraid... for Elizabeth to have the finest lawyer on the coast. In these kind of cases, anyway. His name is R. Palmer Wright. Very imposing name. Anyway, Mr. Wright is flying in from L.A. tomorrow... and he's going to try to have Elizabeth's charges dismissed... on some grounds or other. Frankly, I don't understand all the ins and outs. How much money are we talking about, honey? Fifteen hundred dollars, my love. And $1500 is enough to be my love. Come on. Garbage. Give me a hand. Daddy, he's your own son. Don't call him garbage. No, no, no, I didn't call him garbage. I was speaking to him of garbage. The same garbage that has to be picked up in 15 minutes. Let's go. - Okay, anybody want jelly on their toast? - There's no more jelly. Well, I wasn't offering, actually, I was just taking a survey. Dad. This lawyer you got, is he gonna handle Stanley's case too? Who is Stanley? - The kid that she... - Oh. The kid that she was with. I don't know who's handling Stanley's end of things. - That's up to Stanley's family. - Are you gonna let him hang? I know we've got a lot of kids in that house. I don't recall Stanley as being one of them, David. Aw, Dad, that's just dumb. - Why is that dumb? - Because if they reduce the charges... for Elizabeth and not her boyfriend, it'll look like she finked on him. - That's ridiculous. - No, I'm serious. You don't have the right to make her look like that. - No right at all. - Hey, wait, hold on. - No right, did you say? - Yes. I have no right to keep a felony conviction off my daughter's record? My daughter who will shortly be applying to colleges for admissions? - I have no right to try and help her? - Did you ask her if she wants help? No, I sure did not. Just as I did not ask you when you were 7... if you had converted to a belief in faith healing. No, your mother and I just arrogantly took you to the doctor's... and told him to take out your appendix before it burst. - You're missing the point. - Oh, really? Instruct me, please. All right, the point is, Elizabeth isn't 7 years old. She's got a right to make her own choices. I think Elizabeth has made her choice. She chose to break the law. Or are we skipping over that item? What about when you broke the law, that sit-in? That was a bad law. - So is the law dealing with... - And I paid the penalty! Which is what you ought to let Elizabeth do... instead of making her look like some cop helper. A, since when is it a crime to help the police? And B, why are you so worried about what people think Elizabeth did... when you know she did not help the police? You're not listening to a word I say. - Toby's dead. What? What did you say, Nicholas? I said, Toby's dead. Who is Toby, Nicholas? Who was Toby? Toby is the guinea pig in Nicholas' class. He choked on a carrot, the teacher said. Oh. Oh, I'm sorry, Nicholas. I think I did meet Toby once at a PTA meeting. He appeared to be a very nice guinea pig. We get to bury him after lunch. Good, it's always nice to have something to look forward to. Why are we talking about poor old Toby? So you and David won't yell at each other anymore. - You've got a very smart brother. - It runs in the family. I'm gonna finish my breakfast, excuse me. I wanna talk to you. Mr. Bradford, I don't think it's any of your business. Oh, no, no, let me rephrase the question. Do the majority of women working here wear bras? It's a family matter. It's my responsibility as a father to find out. Some do and some don't. My daughter will not be satisfied with that answer. What am I signing? Group insurance forms for Nicholas' tonsillectomy. Insurance pays 50 percent. Oh. Maybe we should get the doctor to just take out one tonsil... and then they would pay for it all. A hundred dollars or so won't hurt you. It won't help either. - Okay. Anything else? - Yes. Yes, a Mr. Wright may be calling me. Not Mr. Right like in the Warner Bros. love stories... - but a Mr. W-R-I-G-H... - I understand. Okay, you understand. Well, anyway, if Mr. Wright calls, he's my lawyer. Put him through no matter where I am or who's here. - Regardless, all right? - Okay. Dr. Maxwell wants to know if you can play hooky... - for golf this afternoon. - No, I can't. Joan and I are taking Nicholas to the hospital for a sightseeing tour. They didn't do that when I had my tonsils out. It's a good idea. Did you wear a bra during the operation? Goodbye, Mr. Bradford. Farewell, my heart. You got ink all over your hands. Oh. Well, to, uh, what do I owe the honor? Listen, I've only got about 15 minutes before I have to be back to work. What can I do for you? If you get out of there... I'll do something for you like fix that ribbon. Actually, I could do it myself... but your mother wants me home before autumn. Listen, uh... I've been thinking about that set-to this morning. Remember? Yes, I remember it. Then let's face it now. This isn't the first time we've gone around together like that, right? I mean, we had words when I dropped out of Cal... you weren't too crazy about me getting that motorcycle. Anyway, the point is... I've been thinking about it all morning. I can't seem to get it out of my head. Especially what Nicholas said... about you and me yelling at each other all the time. What do you recommend, David? I think I should move out of the house. I mean... we'll both be better off this way. Okay. And I was feeling so smug. I thought he had come up to apologize. Well, do you think he really was that definite? Oh, yes, he was that definite, all right. Well, Tom, we always said we wanted our children to be independent. Don't quote me to me. Fight fair, please. Hi, can I help you? Oh, yeah, we're Mr. and Mrs. Bradford. Doctor Nagel's gonna be doing a tonsillectomy on our son. I see. You'd like the get-acquainted tour. Wait here and I'll find Dr. Himmler, okay? Dr. Himmler? That's comforting. Hi, Mrs. Bradford. How are you? Hi, Mr. Forrester. I'm just fine, and you? Holding my own. You're the Bradfords? - Yeah. - Hi. I'm Bill Himmler. - Hello. - And this is Nicholas, our patient? - That's the guy. - Hi, Nicholas. - Hi. I'm Dr. Himmler. I understand you're coming in here on Thursday... so we can take those tonsils on out. Yes, sir. Did Dr. Nagel explain to you just why we wanna take your tonsils out? Because of infections, he said. That's pretty much correct, Nicholas. We don't know exactly why some boys and girls do get infected tonsils... and some boys and girls don't. But we can be pretty sure that once yours are out... you'll be having a lot fewer colds and sniffles. And I imagine that makes you feel pretty good, huh? - Yes, sir. It does. - Well, come on. I'll show you the recovery room. Joan? Who's Mr. Forrester? He's an architect. He's an architect I commissioned to, um, draw up plans to expand our bedroom. Is he visiting somebody here? I didn't ask. What do you mean, commissioned? I mean that, uh, he's dropping the plans off Friday... and we owe him $575. I know we don't have $575... because we owe Elizabeth's lawyer $1500... plus a hundred or so for Nicholas' tonsils... and we don't have that kind of money in the bank. And that's what I wanted to talk to you about. Hey, Dad? Hey. What do you want? The doctor told me when I breathe into a balloon, I won't feel anything hurt me. Dr. Himmler, do you have one of those balloons in a 39 regular? Yeah. Come in. I brought you some more boxes in case you need them. Oh, I could sure use them, thanks. How are you gonna get all these things over to your new place? Mm. Willie's coming over. We're gonna use his truck. David... - tell me about your new apartment. - Oh, it's nothing special. Just a small place with a little kitchenette. But it's close to stores and stuff like that. Oh. With your cooking talent... I doubt if that kitchenette's gonna see much service. I'm writing a book: A Thousand Ways to Serve Scrambled Eggs. We're gonna miss you, David. There's gonna be a lot less hassle with me in my own place. Easier on everybody. If you need any more boxes, let me know. Okay? Will do. Okay. Okay. Mom, Mom? Is Daddy still awake? I don't know, I was talking to David. Well, um, we wanna talk to you, if we can. To both of you, please. One day they're on the potty, next day they're smoking pot. Mom? Dad? Can we come in now? Okay. What were you watching? Uh, just some slides of people we used to know. - Ah. What can we do for you? MARY: We wanna talk to you about David. About his moving out. Wait a minute. I figured that this would come up. Going in, there's something that you ought to know. Ought to know what, Dad? When your mother and I became parents, we had to give up certain privileges. We had to give up staying out all night if we felt like it... or sleeping in till noon if we felt like that. Bear in mind, I'm not complaining. I mean, what we received far outweighs anything that we gave up. Because what we gave up were privileges. But... being a parent does not require me to give up one right. And among the rights that every human being on the face of this earth has... is the right not to be hypocritical, not to have to apologize for something... when he doesn't feel that he's done anything wrong. Accordingly... if you expect me to apologize to your brother for the argument we had... I am afraid that I will have to give you a flat refusal. Because remember, parents are citizens and citizens have rights... and the answer is no. Why don't you find out what the question is before you give us an answer? You mean, you don't want me to apologize to David? Frankly, Dad, um, most of us think that you should... but Elizabeth doesn't think that you should. She's the one that got busted. If you don't feel you should apologize, don't. Do you think we're doing the right thing arranging for this lawyer? Yeah. And I told David that too. - How come you didn't tell us? - I just did. It wouldn't do any good to apologize. - I mean, David's still moving out, right? - Oh, yes. Agreed. - Go on. - Well, then what is the question? We wanna know who's gonna get David's room. Dad, listen... What are you doing up? You first. Well, I'm up because your father is grinding his teeth so loudly... it's enough to move the San Andreas Fault. So I thought I would look at these football slides again. - Did they turn out good? - Yeah, they're really good. What are you doing up so early? I have to be at the lab by 6:30 to watch the bats. Watch what? The bats. We're doing a study on the waking cycle of the gray bat. And I've got the 6:30 to 9:30 bat shift. Is that cold pizza? You're eating cold pizza and you're gonna watch a bat wake up? Your generation is so much stronger than ours. I mean, we woke up to hot cocoa and marshmallows. You really think there's that much difference? - In generations, I mean. - Yeah, don't you? Uh-uh. No... except for... - This is really good pizza, it really is. - Except what, Mary? Except the size of the families kids wanna have... when they get married. - Well, you can't compare 1950 to 1976. - I'm not. Not really. Sometimes I get a little needling from the kids at school. Oh. Well, Mary, when your father and I got married... we were only planning to have a couple of kids, you know, a boy and a girl. And we had a boy, we had a girl... and another girl, and another girl, another girl... Why didn't you do something? I don't understand... Mary, what I'm trying to tell you nicely is that about four of you were accidents. Accidents? Yeah. It's not very flattering to be an accident. That doesn't mean you're not loved, it just means that you weren't planned. There's a big difference. Okay. I gotta go. Do you have any words of advice for the kids at school? Yeah, tell them to, um, stay cool, relax, I've got everything under control. I've joined the Pregnancy Anonymous Club. Never again. I'll see you later. He's doing just fine. I'll be back in a few minutes. Tom, would you relax? It's just tonsils. It's Nicholas' tonsils. It's not just tonsils. I'll have them bronzed for you. Come on, sit down. I'm gonna check the office, see if there are any calls. Got a better idea. Why don't you go to the office? Suppose something goes wrong. If something goes wrong, I promise you, I'll call you. Hello, Donna, it's me. What's going on? Him, I'll call back later. Oh, yeah? Hmm. Yeah, all right. Yeah, I'll be back this afternoon. Goodbye. Our good lawyer, Mr. Wright, flew into town this morning. He dropped a writ off at the courthouse that will get Elizabeth's charges reduced. Then he went to the office and picked up my check... which will get our bank account reduced. He is now on the return flight to L.A. For that kind of money, you'd think we'd at least get to meet him or kiss his ring. Sweetheart, maybe someday the meek will inherit the earth... but if they do, you can count on the fact... that there'll be a lawyer there to handle the probate. Amen. What about Mr. Forrester's $575? I will simply, uh, call Mr. Forrester... go over to his house dressed as a bloodless turnip... and tell him that we'll pay him over a period of time. - There's nothing else we can do. - I'm sorry, babe. Let's see now... one daughter being charged with felony drug offense. One small son just out of surgery. One large son leaving home for good. Half a thousand further in debt. So far, so good. Hey, Dad. TOMMY: Hi, Dad. - See you. - See you later. Anybody home? Silence. Sometimes not so terrific. I'll get it. Oh, hello, I'm Mr. Bradford. Is your father home? Ah, right here, Mr. Bradford. Right here. Ben Forrester. Come on in. You'll freeze out there in the cold. This is my son, Billy. - Hi, Bill. - Hi, Mr. Bradford. Den's right around the corner. Can I get you anything? Uh... - Drink? Beer? Coffee? Anything? - No. No, not a thing. Thank you. No? Well, then, sit down. Go ahead. You know, first off, Mr. Bradford, heh... you don't have to worry about my ego. - Please? - Well... the plans, they're not engraved in stone. I don't have the money to pay for the plans. That's why I'm here. I wanna work out, like, a time payment schedule... something like that, if that would be all right. Wow. You know, Mr. Bradford, I spent a lot of time... working on those plans, and frankly, I wasn't obligated to deliver the plans. The telephone is ringing. Dad. Excuse me, Dad. Dr. Cooper's on the phone for you. Oh. Yes, doctor. Ben Forrester. How are you? Yeah, good, good, good. Well, listen, uh, have you found out anything that you can tell us? Yeah, yeah, yeah, I... Uh, well... Right, right. Yeah, yeah. Uh, well, thank you very much, doctor. Well... no change one way or the other. Okay. I'll be upstairs. Well, where were we? Uh, working out a time payment for the money that we owe you. You know, Mr. Bradford, I pay my bills. I'm not a deadbeat, and frankly, I didn't think you were, either. I'm not a deadbeat, or I wouldn't be here now, would I? You wanna know what the problem in this world is, Mr. Bradford? Is that people don't realize that they have to pay as they go along. You see, they wanna mortgage their future. If I could get $100 a month together, would that be all right? My son, Billy, has leukemia. A hundred dollars a month, uh... see, that would be about, uh, six months, then. Is that agreed? Sure, sure, that'd be fine. Yeah, yeah... six months. Mr. Forrester... could I use the phone, please? Yeah, yeah, sure. Hello, Joan, it's me. What's the new address of David's apartment? Yeah, just a second. Coming. - Hi. How are you? - Cold. Oh, yeah. Come on in. Come on. - The place is okay. - Yeah. It'll do. What do you want, Dad? Oh, yeah, well, uh... the reason I came here... fell by. That what you say? - No. - Oh. Well, um... it's hard to know exactly how to phrase this, but... Either you're a transvestite, or I'm intruding. The latter. I came here to tell you I love you, David. Loved you when you were a baby and every day since then. I loved you when I agreed with what you were doing... and I loved you when I disagreed with you. I loved you when I came this close to knocking your head off... for some arrogant, thoughtless thing that you did. From the day one, David... you have been loved. I don't know if it's important for you to hear that... but I know that right now, it's important for me to say it to you. Oh, and please remember... I have no wish at this point in my life to become a grandfather. I'll keep it in mind. Thank you very much. Tails. We receive. - We'll defend the east goal. Play ball. JOAN: All right. - I feel silly. - Don't worry about it. We'll kill them. You'll be another Joe Namath. - Only the pantyhose are the same. - Ready! Come on! I got it. I got it. David! Tom, are you okay? - Huh? Yes, yes, I'm all right. I'm all right. Don't worry about me, I'm fine, I'm fine. I lost it in the sun, that's all. What sun? Hi, Mom. JOAN: Hi. Well, at least I got one play in. That's better than last week. All right. Let's have a huddle. Put the ball on the five-yard line. All right, come on. Okay. All right, come on. Don't worry about your mother, she's got a no-cut contract. All right, now, listen, Elizabeth, you go short over the middle. Nancy, you go to the left flat. David, you go long down the sides. - Tommy... - No, no, no, wait, I don't think so. - What do you mean? - I'm always going long. Why don't you go long for once? It's my team. It's everybody's team. - Yeah. Really. JOANIE: Hey, Dad, you don't own us. You're right. I don't own you. So Dad goes long? - You think you can? - Sure, I can do it. Don't worry about me. I'll be all right. All right, now, everybody, on three. Whoa, whoa, whoa. - You're not passing, I am. On two. Break. TOMMY: Break. All right, here's our touchdown. Hut one. Hut two. Hike. Come on, come on, come on. Tom, dog dirt down there! Dog dirt! OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
