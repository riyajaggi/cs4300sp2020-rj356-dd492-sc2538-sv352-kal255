 ?10,000. I found it in William's wardrobe. Last month it was ?5,000 in his kitbag. So, what was his excuse this time, then? He hasn't said a word, and he knows I've taken it. But it's like he's pretending it hasn't happened. His name is William Joseph Mortimer, aged 36. He's married to the client, Sally Mortimer. He earns 40 grand a year, most of which goes on the mortgage, and he stashes ten grand in his sock draw. Why? I mean, where's it coming from?

 And why ain't he missing it? He works 2-3 days away a week. This week he's supposed to be working in Scotland. But the fact is, he's booking three days out for a holiday. - Have you told the client that yet? - Hold on a minute. - Just find out what he's doing first. - Industrial espionage? - Well, let's find that out. - Industrial espionage. Sorry. I just like saying that. There's a woman involved. Treated himself to new clothes. - Yeah. - So, you don't think it's industrial espionage. Sorry, boss. It's a picture of modern domestic bliss, eh? Hunter-gatherer goes off to forage while homemaker curses under her breath.

 Is that what it's like in your house? Oh, no, no. Miss World would never come to the door. She'd call from the comfort of her armchair. Sometimes it sounds like you don't like her. I love her. - Yeah. - Gess where I am. I give up. The airport. - What do you think? - It cold still be Scotland. Glasgow, Edinburgh. I don't know, Inverness. What if he's not? Wouldn't he need his car for his work stuff, his samples and his clipboard? All right, well, keep on it. Yo got yor passport? Never without it, mate, me and Simon Templar. Hello. - Hey, it's me. He's going to Madrid. - Madrid? Yes, Madrid, in Spain. I didn't tell you, love, cos I've only just found out. Cos I'm the only one carrying a passport. Cos it makes me feel important. It'll only be for a couple of nights. I'll bring you back something nice. Something Spanish - like an omelette. Vincent, there's something coming through from John. My old hombre John. Right, I've picked him up. He's with a woman. He calls her Julia. They're sharing a room. They're very, very friendly. She calls all the shots. Boss, should we be er... should we be sitting together? You can go and sit over there, if you like. Well, I'm just saying. The target and his bird are 35,000 feet over Birmingham at the moment, so I think we can take a chance. - Have you ever had a girlfriend, Robert? - Non-inflatable? Preferably, yeah. - Are you offering, Gillian? - You wish! Oi, do you two kids want to go and have a wee-wee before Uncle Johnny's aeroplane lands? - Yeah, me. - Me, too. - Does that make me mother? - If you like. Surreal! Hola. Just landed. Right, he's wearing a pale blue suit and Julia's complementing him very nicely in a black top and a cappuccino skirt. They're back to pretending they don't know each other. He's on his way through to you... now. He'll be with you in seconds. Back in a minute. John, I'm still waiting here. - Is he still on your side? - No, he's gone. - He must be somewhere between us. - Cstoms? - What's Julia up to? - She'sjst got her bag. She's here. I'll call you back. You got her? I think you'd better come with us, sir. Cheers. Saved me the bother. - I've not seen you before. - No, I work away a lot. Oh, right. - Doing what? - Minding my own business. Sorry. Being nosy. What floor? 11, please. - Hello. - Sal, it's me. - Where are you? - Sally, I've been arrested. They found cocaine in my suitcase. Honest to God, I swear I've got no idea how it got there. Are yo still there, Sal? Just about. I'm in cort tomorrow. Can yo be there? Please. Yo being there might help me with getting bail. If I find ot yo're involved in drgs, I'm leaving yo and I'm taking the boys with me. How much cocaine, I wonder? Mm. Cos that explains the ten grand. Yeah. Do you think he's selling it? Well, he's either selling it or he's laundering the money. If he travels around a bit, he can change a grand here, a grand there. Mm. Either that or he's telling the truth. Huh! And I'm teetotal. - Have they got a back door to this place? - No, there's a fire exit. I put a bleeper there. If anyone opens the door, we'll hear it. You are so good. Yeah, well, watch and learn, kid, watch and learn. - You're here all night, then. - Yeah. - Unless you're volunteering. - You've got no chance. I don't mind sitting here. Since I sold the flat, it's not like home any more. - You'll have to start looking for a new place. - Yeah, I will. - Right, well, I'll leave you to it. - Don't bump your head. Yeah. - Good night, Vincent. - Good night. Good night, Beth. Beth, she's coming to you. - Hi, can I help you? - Yeah, function rooms and menus... - Private or corporate? - It's a wedding. - Oh... - No, not me, it's my sister. - I'll just get those for you now. One sec. - Great, thanks. OK, thank you. That's room 448, which is on the fourth floor. Out of the lift, turn right and right again. OK. - Perfect. - We are, aren't we? Keep away from that mini-bar. - See you later. - See you later. She's had two separate visitors. Both female, both attractive. They stay for abot 15-20 mintes, that's it. Hang on, hang on. It's gone from a cheating husband to what? - Are we interested in these women? - No, not really. Julia's the key. You're looking for a way into Julia? No, into Mortimer, so we know who she is. Jlia Kerr. K, E, doble R. That's the name on her credit card. It might be on her credit card, Beth. It doesn't necessarily mean that's who she is. Yeah, hang on. Someone's coming. Another woman. Early 30s, smartly dressed. God, it's like The Stepford Wives. Beth, look, if Julia leaves, follow her. Whatever you do, don't lose her. - I could do with someone outside in the lobby. - Right, I'll sort it. - I was in a band. - You was in a band? What was you called? St David's Marching Band. Yeah, we were good. Yeah, I'll bet you was. Right, I want you to wait here and watch that door in case Julia comes out. - Where are you going to be? - I'll be in there, in the warm. Yeah? Beth? - Vincent, she's on the move. Where are you? - We're outside now. Listen, we'll pick her up, yeah? Come on. Is she the other woman? She doesn't look too happy, does she? Listen, get on the blower to Beth and tell her where we are. Yeah. Where are you going? - How long for a cab for the airport, mate? - About half an hour. What about the one sitting outside? It's out of service. Oh! Oh. How much is it going to be, then? About. You know, roughly? - To the airport? - Yeah. About ?30-?35. Well, do you want one? - Yeah. - Right. - What's the name? - Muggins. Charlie-2? When you're clear, base job, Charlie-2. Listen, you haven't got a toilet I could use, have you? No. Then I'll need a car with a big ashtray. Come on, mate. - You must have a khazi I can use. - There's a pub across the road. Oh, well, thanks very much. You've been a great help. - Were you laughing at us? No. - I think you were. - No! - You thought we were stupid bastards. - I'm really sorry. Only, it turns out we're not stupid. But you... You're gorgeous, you know that? Isn't she? I wouldn't say no. The thing is, you cut me and it's just another scar. I cut you, Amanda, and that would be a pity. That would be a shame. Get up, I hardly touched you. Get... up! It's all right, love, it's all right. What's your name? - Amanda. - You come with me, Amanda, come on. You're not the police. Who are you? I'm Special Agent Smith, this is Special Agent Johnson and the lad over there is the office gimp. That's John, I'm Vincent. And I'm Robert. - Amanda. - Mandy. Amanda. How long have you been working for Julia? I don't know a Julia. Julia. You met her in the Midland Hotel. You travelled together to the cab firm. In a taxi. Sorry, boss, I felt left out. No, you're right, we're not the Old Bill. But I don't mind calling the Old Bill. And tell them what? You know, you're right again? There's nothing to tell them. I'll tell you what. You drink your tea, and then you can go. Get rid of that. - Go where? Will you be all right? - Who are you? - No-one special. Want a biscuit with that? - No. Thank you. Look, will you stay with me while I collect my gear from my flat? We could do that. I've been working for her for just over a year. Doing what? Courier. Every couple of months I take five kilos of cocaine from A to B. I give the coke to Julia, she checks it and gives it back to me. And I distribute it to five clients. One kilo each, no more. But you're not the only one, are you? Julia's got other girls. How many? I don't know. We're not allowed to meet. - Who runs Julia? - Nobody. Julia's head girl. The geezer at the taxi firm, is he one of your clients? Yes. So, how did you piss him off? Did you get greedy? Yeah. I cut my five bags by a fifth to make my very own kilo. He was the only one who noticed. I think because he cooks it. What, crack? Yeah. You can make a lot of stones from a kilo. A lot of money. What's Julia got to say about that? Nothing. She took me there and she walked away. She'll hear about what's happened. She'll be wondering who you are. - Do you recognise this geezer? - That's Billy. Billy. Julia likes to have a boyfriend. For the last couple of months he's been it. - They never last. - Why not? I don't know. You'll have to ask Julia. So, how does Julia find her boyfriends, then? She got a favourite place, like a bar, a club? She met the last two in a hotel. I'm sorry. I laid down and I shouldn't have done. Beth, we've all done it. It was Superman here saving the girl Amanda that spooked her. I'm sorry. We should have had someone outside. We'd still have struggled, Vince. It was early hours. Empty roads. We'd have needed three cars at least. Look, she's clever. Now we know it. OK. Besides sitting outside a flat which she has probably already abandoned, how do we go about finding her again? Your sign says you're looking for drivers. - Might be. Got your own car? - Got my own furry dice. It's ?110 a week, settled. That's for rent of the radio. If anything goes wrong, your responsibility. Sounds reasonable. If you're interested, take a seat through the door marked "dickheads". Sorry, "drivers". I'll dig you out a form. Thank you. All right? 110's a bit steep, isn't it? Don't bother with it. With what? Taxis. Not my thing. OK, we're ready for you now. This is Joel. When he used to talk to me. Now all he does is eff and blind. We don't know what else to do. I tried following him myself, but he saw me. Went ballistic, didn't he? Sure. So, all you really want to know is what you're dealing with, yeah? Yeah. That's right. - Spying on your own kid? That's sick. - Why is it? - Just is. - Not if they're worried about him. - He's 15. Why don't they just talk to him? - Because he's 15. Don't you want to be involved in this case, then? I'm a professional. Course I do. Cos you're the one who'll follow him to school every morning. - What if he doesn't go? - Stay with him. - Do I get the van? - What for? He's only got a skateboard. - All right? - Got the money? Let's see it. It could be anything, John. Every one of these pictures is a deal. - So? - It's the gear that Julia brought in. Her gear out on the streets in what, 36, 48 hours? We could find Julia through the cab office. No, it's a long shot. It's too long. Hotels are the best bet. She's got unfinished business and she likes five-stars. Plus, if it's how she meets her boyfriends, then, you know, it could be a way in. What, as her boyfriend? Honey trap. If it's either you or me, mate, it must be Marmite. So who's it going to be, me or you? - It's got to be me, innit? - I disagree. I saw her first. You're married. We might have to give her one. It would be work, it wouldn't count. - Do you think she'd go for me? - Don't see why not, mate. She went for Mortimer. It's not as if she's fussy. - Thank you very much. - You're welcome. I need a pee. - Yeah. Vincent. - It's Alan at the airport Radisson. I think your lovely is checking in as we speak. Right. Cheers. You look smart and you're casual. That's exactly the look I was going for. - Would you go for him, Beth? - No. You could have lied. You look very nice, Vincent. Very clean. I need one of them squirty things for my mouth. It's all dry. You'll be all right after a couple of beers. - Are you not wearing a wire? - He might have to get naked. Oi, steady. Might have to wear something else later. How far are you prepared to go? What sort of question's that to ask someone? One you should have asked yourself before you became a dollop of honey. - Dollop? - Oh, I just mean you're very... sweet. Yeah? - I hope she don't laugh at me. - You look lovely. Do I? Robust. Jesus Christ, Beth, I mean a barn door is robust. - Yes, sir? - Bottle of lager, please. - Are they cold? - They're in the fridge. Just cos they're in the fridge doesn't mean they're cold. That's still warm. Can I have one off the back shelf, please? Not asking too much, am I? Not at all, no. Thank you. Where are you flying to? Yeah, you, where are you flying to? I'm not, unfortunately. Except home, you know. I came in a car and I'll leave in a car. So, where's home? - Well, it was London. Now it's Essex. - So, what are you doing here? You're very nosy. Do you mind? Nah. So, what are you doing up north? Business. Property? No. Rubber. PVC, leather, all kinds of kinky fabrics, you know. I import clothes from Asia, mostly China. And then I try and knock 'em out. What about you, where are you flying off to? Nowhere. So, what are you doing here, then? Are you on business? - Business? - Mm. Are you suggesting I might be some kind of erm... a call girl? Well, I was. But I wish I wasn't now. - Sorry. - I'm here for business meetings. Nine to five. And er... fully clothed. Well, I'm sorry. Do I look like a call girl? No, you look very nice. And that's all I'm prepared to say. I'm sorry. Accepted. So, you drove to an airport hotel? Yeah, I like aeroplanes. I could have gone into the city, but I like aeroplanes and airports. Romantic. No, it's anorak. Do you fancy a peanut? No, thank you. Ruin my appetite. So, you haven't eaten yet? Not yet, no. Me neither. - That's something we share in common. - You care to join me? Er... Yeah. Yeah. We can either stay here or we can erm... have a stroll round Terminal 2 and have an all-day breakfast. I've already had breakfast. Can't get wine with breakfast. Well, you obviously haven't been to Essex. How's it developing? Very well. It's all very civilised. They're on coffee and brandies. What are we on? - Toblerone. - Oh, yes. The chocolate of travellers. He won't sleep with her, will he? Not unless he has to. And what if I did that, hm? What would that make me? A lesbian. When you said you fancied a walk, I thought we'd be using our legs. Did you? What made you think that? What are you looking at? You. Deciding if I want to see you again. You'd better make your mind up. I'm only here for a week. - Have you got a business card? - Yeah. Vincent Devine. Yeah, sounds like a pub singer, don't it? ? Come fly with me ? Come fly, let's fly away... - I've got another question to ask you. - Go on. If you were flying instead of driving, where would you take me? Venice. ? Once I get you up there ? Where the air is rare... Yeah? - So, how did it go? - Yeah, it was all right. It went well. Are you seeing her again? Well, I dunno. It's up to her. Did you kiss her? Do you know what, John? Sometimes I really worry about you. - Beth wanted to know. - No, Beth didn't. Tell Beth I've still got my cherry. What's that, the room phone? Look, I'll call yo back. - Hello. Hi. I'm looking at your website. Nice smile. Yeah, well, warmth and sincerity is hardly my strong point. So I practise. Although... I really am missing you already. I had a good time. You sound surprised. I only popped out for a cold beer and ended up with a hot flush. Shall I come down and see you? To talk. That's all. Yeah, I'd really like that. I'm in Room 702. I know. It's me again. Come in. - Could you take that? - Yeah. - What's in the basket? What's in the basket? Thought we could have a picnic. - Deli round the corner does 'em. - Bit cold for all that, innit? Put roses in your cheeks. Be good for you. You sound just like my mum. No. I sound just like my mum. Can I have a sip of that? No. - No? - No. What? You've got a milky moustache. Come here. You're not happy, Beth. I can sense it. What he's doing isn't right. What we're doing isn't right. What she's doing is worst of all, so I shouldn't worry about it. Who's the only person that knows all about William Mortimer, apart from William Mortimer? Julia. Which is why Vincent's getting so close. I need some air. You've just had some. Beth, he's free and single. Where's the problem? Oh, dear. Latte, skimmed milk, to take away. Please. Beth? - You came into the caf?! - She didn't see me. She had her back to me. - Unprofessional. - Robert, shut up! - We're all being bloody unprofessional! - Meaning me? - Yeah, especially you. - I'm just doing a job. You like her too much to be doing a proper job! - Sounds like you're jealous. - Grow up! - Been there, done that, had the acne. - So, shut up. Get on the phone and get John back now! - We'll have no-one watching Julia. - I don't care! From now on, this is my job and my job alone! Is that wise? Don't tell me how to run my business! - Right? That's what I want! - Are we cramping what's left of your style? Get on the phone to John now and tell him to get back here! Liven yourself up. What's happening with this kid, this Evans boy? Joel? Him and his mates met up with a dealer again. It's another dare, boss. Dare you to smoke crack. Your dealer is two steps from Julia and that's Vincent's bag. If you've got nothing constructive to say, go home now! Right. I will say this one last time and then I'll be quiet. I do not agree with what you're doing and I'm worried about your judgment. I'd be worried if you wasn't worried. My judgment's fine. End of! Finished! John's switched off. Well, it would be, wouldn't it? What? It's me. Hold on a minute. Hello. - Where are yo? - I'm in a meeting. - Is it going well? - Not really, no. - Where are yo? - Somewhere between a rock and a hard place. Ask me why. Why? I've been checking up on you, Vincent. You don't exist. Wold yo care to comment? Well, I haven't been very well. Listen, I'll explain it all to you when I see you. Are you expecting me to meet you? Yeah. I'd really like that very much. - Where? - Anywhere you like. Hiya. Hi. You look lovely. Thanks. I bought you a beer. It's cold. Thank you. Where is everyone? They've gone home. I know the owner. So, you're not into rubber after all? 'Fraid not, no. Pity. What are you into? You. That's a good start. I'm a private investigator. Ah. I'm working for Sally Mortimer. Billy's wife? At least I was until er... ...five seconds ago. Make that a week ago. How is Billy? I'm not interested in Billy. I'm interested in you. I want to keep seeing you and I think you want to keep seeing me. Otherwise you wouldn't be here. You can talk if you want to. I mean, I'm not wired. There's no-one listening. It's just you and me. You're right. I enjoy your company. I knew it. I'd like to carry on seeing you, if that's possible. I'm not a mug like Billy. - I mean, I don't want to be a part of it. - Part of what? - I know what you do, Julia. - And you disapprove? Yes. - You still want to go on seeing me? - Yes. Give it up. Not yet. Soon. I can make obscene amounts of money. I don't hear you complaining. I'm not. I'm not apologising either. I don't want to work for a living. I've tried it. People will always take drugs. They don't like the pain. All right, lads? Doing some or what? So, you're not Vincent Devine. No. I'm Vincent Gallagher. Pleased to meet you. Julia Violet Lorimer. Violet. - That's nice. - After my nan. Julia Violet... ...I want you to stop it. Do something else. You can do anything you want. And what about... What about the obscene money? Well, I've got money. I've got a jar full of 50-pence pieces. I must have a fortune. Give it up. Or, at least, try and give it up. Come home with me. Cheers, mate. Thank you. It's very nice. I like it. Cost a lot of 50-pence pieces. Thank you. Morning. Hello? Is this a kitchen or what? Can't find anything I recognise - like food. Julia? Got any cereal? I was going to make you some breakfast. I don't eat breakfast. Where are you going? Going out. - Out where? - Out. - Yeah. Where? - My business. Where are you going? What do you want me to say? I dunno... um... Is it a deal, this business? Look... if you're giving me a blank here, Julia, just say so. Do it properly, kick me out. I'll go and sit in the car and start watching you and following you again. What do you want from me? I want the woman I was with last night, not you. I want to keep seeing you. So, give it up. It's not as simple as that. All right. So, what do we do? Eh? What do we do? All right. Come with me. I've got to get someone's agreement before I can stop. Who? He's an American. That's all I'm telling you. What, so we're going to America? Didn't think it was as big as this. I've got to make a phone call. I'll be with you in a minute, all right? Come here. I'll be with you in a minute. He ain't going to show up, is he? Yeah. No. Do you think he's all right? I mean, without backup? No. Would he let any of us do it? No. - Why don't we find him and follow him? - No. - Why not? - Because he's got eyes like a shithouse rat. He wears glasses. Only for reading. Welcome to New York, Ma'am. How you doing, sir? Oh. Thanks. Have a good one. Well? All done. All done. That's it. Honestly? - Yeah. - No problems? Other than being unemployed - no. What did you say? Vincent... it's done. That's fantastic. Fantastic. How do you feel? I feel like celebrating. ? UP-TEMPO MODERN JAZZ Yeah! You feel lovely. I do feel lovely. I love it here. Love it. I won't be a minute. We'd like to do one now. It's one of our favourites. Hope it's one of yours. It's The Man I Love. The Man I Love Two large gin and tonics, please, mate. Plenty of ice. - There you go, sir. - Table No.6. Hi. Sorry. - Is that mine? - Yeah. Thanks. - Cheers. - Cheers. Who was that? Some guy I used to know. He wanted to know who you were. Oh, yeah? What did you say? I told him you were my boyfriend. - That's right, isn't it? - Hm. Well, it's been a long while since I've been called a boy. Is that all he wanted? It's over. It's over. Here you are. What is it? It's a good-luck note from the guy at the club. What, The Man With No Name? It's Tommy. I think you just made that up. I'm not going to argue. All done. All done. That's it. - Honestly? - Yeah. Still at work? Did you find anything? I'm sorry. What were you looking for? I didn't look inside, I promise you. I promise. I heard you in the bathroom on the phone and I saw you talking to that geezer in the club and... ...and I just saw how much you loved it all. No. You saw how happy I was tonight. I came here to be with you. And I've given it up, like you've asked me to. I've done nothing wrong. That phone call was to the club, to make sure we got in. Sorry. I can't show his mother that. It would kill her. - Morning. - Morning. How are you feeling? Positive or negative? Humble. Ever so humble. I'm sorry about last night. You're forgiven. I thought we could eat out for breakfast. - Fancy it? - Yeah. I'm up for anything. Julia? I'm just going to get some papers. - None left? - What? - Newspapers. - No. You'll have to spend the rest of the day uninformed. You going to be much longer? I'm nearly done. - What's that for? - I missed you. Sir, would you mind if I had a quick look through your bags? - Yeah, all right. - Won't take a minute. Would you mind bringing your bag to the table? Sure. Pack the bag yourself, sir? Yeah. - Did you pack your bag yourself? - Yeah. Has it been with you at all times? Yeah. Have you been away on business or pleasure? Pleasure. - Had a good flight? - Yeah. What's this here? That's a device. Tells me if anyone's opened my bag. Neat. Yeah. Thank you, sir. That's fine. Thank you. Simon? So, you're back. Of course I'm back. Can't stay away. It's a habit. Give us one of them. Cheers. You look nice. Thanks. You look... less robust. I'm broken-hearted, actually. Again? Yeah, again. What you said about my judgment, you were right. It's dodgy. So, next time, do me a favour - shout louder. What happened? In your own time. Yeah? Beth. Yeah? In my own time. Thanks.
