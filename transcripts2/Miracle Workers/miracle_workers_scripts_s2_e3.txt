And that's just allowed? {\an1}Eh, they never check.

One second -- just setting up the music. {\an7}Bard, play "Party Mix." {\an8}♪ Party, party, party ♪ {\an8}♪ Everybody's at the party ♪ {\an8}♪ We're all at the party, party, party ♪ {\an8}Skip. {\an8}♪ A bear has a long, long tail ♪ {\an8}♪ He lives in a -- ♪ {\an7}Skip. {\an8}♪ Party, party, party, ev-- ♪ {\an8}Stop. {\an8}Prince, when we meet Prince Ya-Shayn, {\an8}you need to say a traditional greeting. {\an8}Repeat after me. {\an9}[ Speaking Valdrogian ] Hush may-nah. Hush mah-nu. {\an8}I mean, I think he'll probably speak English. {\an3}No, you can't just assume that everyone speaks English. Important people do, though. First of all, yikes. Secondly, I have no record of them {\an3}speaking anything other than ancient Valdrogian. {\an3}If you want to survive, you need to keep your mouth shut. -You are the expert. -[ Sighs ] [ Whip cracks, horse neighs ] Bard: ♪ Party, party, party ♪ ♪ Everybody's at the party ♪ Stop. {\an3}Remind me again why we're taking the morning off. I'll give you two hints. It's awesome, and you're gonna love it. {\an8}♪♪ {\an1}What's ShitCon? Only the biggest event in the entire shit-shoveling industry. {\an1}We're talking info booths and demos and networking. -Cool. -Eddie! Gary, you son of a bitch, get over here. [ Laughs ] Rebecca, what are you doing here? -I thought you died. -[ Laughs ] No. -How do you all know each other? -Are you kidding? {\an1}Your dad is the best damn shoveler in town. Oh, come on. Yeah, when termites ate my cart, he helped me build a new one. Wow. Last winter, when my knee exploded, {\an1}he covered my roof for me. {\an3}Yeah, and he's not just good with a shovel. {\an1}Your dad is the most fair, the most honest man in this business. Dad, I had no idea you were so awesome. I do my best. [ Trumpets playing ] [ Indistinct chatter ] -What's that? -I don't know. Ingenuity. The future. Disruption. Move fast. Break things. Break the chains. Today, I present to you a simple yet revolutionary innovation that will make the act of shoveling completely obsolete. -What the hell is this? -You're missing it. Introducing the hole. [ Audience gasps ] It's a hole in the ground that you shit in, so you just put the shit in the hole, and then you don't have to shovel anything. [ Cheers and applause ] Right? {\an1}So cool. I can't believe no one's thought of that before. It's really gonna change things, huh? {\an8}♪♪ Vexler: Remember, follow my lead, and don't say anything. [ Horse whinnies ] [ Metal clanging ] {\an8}♪♪ [ Metal scraping ] {\an8}♪♪ [ Chains clinking ] [ Inhales ] [ Speaking Valdrogian ] Hey, brah, I'm sorry to interrupt. Um, do I know you from somewhere? Uh... Um, I don't -- I don't think so. Ah, this is killing me. Um... {\an3}[ Clicks tongue ] Uh, do y-- uh, no. Do you ever go to Falcon Island? {\an1}Yes, my father has a stronghold there. We summer there every year. I've 100 percent seen you around. Wait, were you at Princess Alison's barbecue last year? [ Laughing ] Oh, my God. Yeah. Oh. Oh, me and Alison go all the way back. {\an1}Me, too. We met at baby ski camp in the Forbidden Mountains. My uncle owns those mountains. He's the one that made them forbidden. {\an1}This -- This is wild. [ Laughing ] This is crazy. So dope. {\an1}Aww! Yeah, man. {\an1}Delightful. Hell yeah. Come on in. Man, let's kick it. Chauncley: Yes. {\an1}[ Speaks Valdrogian ] So, this is the crib. Wow. {\an3}How was the trip, man? Did you travel private? Oh, yeah. That's what's up. {\an3}Okay. So, wait, back up. Your cousin knows my cousin? No, no, no, my cousin knows Princess Alison... -Who's friends with my cousin. -Yes, exactly. -Holy shit! -This is crazy. Oh, my God. Lord Vexler, isn't this crazy? Uh-huh, yeah, it's crazy. What a coincidence. Should we return our focus on the treaty? Dude, what is up with your butler? N-No, I'm -- I'm not a butler. I'm a lord, the minister of the realm. Okay, dude. [ Laughs ] Yo, Chauncley, do you drink blood? {\an3}'Cause my dad's got this, like, sick-ass blood cellar. [ Scoffs ] Yeah, I got nothing. {\an3}Uh, could we get a bottle of that '93, please? Thank you. [ Laughs ] It's dumb, huh? I mean, why would you shit in a hole {\an1}when you could just go on the floor of your house {\an1}and pay someone to remove it after a couple of days? I don't know, Dad. {\an3}Holes seem like a pretty drastic improvement over the current system. Oh, plenty of bells and whistles, if you ask me. It'll never catch on. Trust me. {\an1}[ Chuckles ] Gladys, Eddie here. Morning pickup. Hello, Eddie. {\an3}No need. I've just got one of those new holes installed. {\an3}It's easier, cheaper, and better for the environment -- a total game-changer. [ Indistinct chatter ] Bard: ♪ Party, party, party ♪ ♪ Everybody's at the party ♪ Ya-Shayn: Yo, I love this song! Turn it up! Bard: [ Louder ] ♪ Party, party, party ♪ ♪ Doing things inside the party ♪ ♪ Now they're scooting at the party ♪ ♪ We are bouncing everybody up and down at the party ♪ [ Sighs ] Frank, come on. Even you? I'm sorry, Eddie. I'm sure you understand. {\an3}The hole is a great money-saver, and the kids love it. {\an1}It's -- It's fun for them. I understand. Your mind's made up. Just do me a favor and kiss me on the mouth. What? Why? Because that's the way I like being kissed when I'm getting [bleep]! {\an1}Whoa! Okay, Dad, you've got to calm down. If the business is changing, {\an1}that just means we have to figure out how to adapt. No way! {\an3}I'm not gonna let this newfangled technology replace me. If they're gonna fight dirty, so am I. [ Chicken clucks ] [ Cow moos ] Ya-Shayn: Hold on, brah. I'll be right back. [ Indistinct chatter ] {\an8}♪♪ {\an8}♪♪ [ Knock on door ] Frank? Gladys? What are you doing here? We need your dad. Hey, what's up? Trouble in paradise? [ Sighs ] You were right. Eddie, those holes didn't work out. {\an1}[ Scoffs ] Oh, no. Really? [ Chuckles ] What happened? {\an3}We all came home from work to find snakes living in them. They bite -- so sharp -- and they're laying eggs. {\an1}Please, come back. Well, you're lucky I'm generous. -I'll be back. -Oh. [ Laughs ] I'm not sure when. My schedule is just crazy, you know, people shitting left and right, but I'll see what we can work out. [ Chuckles ] You see, Al? {\an3}Now, aren't you glad we didn't do anything rash, {\an1}like change our business? {\an1}Dad, did you put those snakes in those people's holes? {\an3}Eh, I may've had a little something to do with it. You tricked people, Dad! That's not right! {\an1}What was I supposed to do? They're the ones who started playing dirty. {\an1}No! No, you did. I thought you were the most fair, honest man in the business. {\an1}Guess I was wrong. Ally, sweetheart. Oh. ♪ Two steps back a little jauntily ♪ ♪ And that is how you do the Chauncley ♪ Hey, hey! [ Cheers and applause ] Oh, my, you're too kind. You're too kind. Say, it's getting a little late. Just to get it out of the way, what do you say we, {\an1}uh, sign this treaty? All right. Yeah, sounds good, bro. Hey, but first... {\an8}♪♪ {\an1}Thank you. ...let's finish this. {\an1}Yes, cheers. {\an1}Vexler: Aah! [ Everyone gasps ] Oh, what the hell, man?! -Vexler, what was that? -This is poison. They're trying to poison you. No, it's not. {\an1}Then why does it say "danger" on the side? That's "dan-gur." It's a brand of high-end rhino blood. {\an3}Mmm! Notes of copper and some very playful tannins. Yes. I -- I overheard you in the kitchen. You said the last person they had at a blood tasting died. Yeah, our buddy Brandt died. He got really drunk on blood, and he climbed up on the roof {\an3}to do a backflip into the pool, but at the last second, it turned out that there was no pool. I'll never forget his last words -- "Shit, bro. No pool." [ Sighs ] [ Crying ] I miss Brandt. We all do, Brian. {\an8}♪♪ Well, this party has officially been fouled. It's time for us to go. -No, no, no. Uh, w-w-we have to sign the treaty. {\an3}Nah, bro, that's done. Your butler really shit the bed. Sorry, war's back on. {\an8}♪♪ ♪ Party, party, party ♪ ♪ Everybody's at the party ♪ {\an3}How could I have made such a big mistake? Your father is going to be furious. {\an1}Maybe it'll be fine. In my experience, when you make a mistake, {\an1}things have a way of just working themselves out. For you. You can screw up a million times, and there's never any consequences, but I'm gonna lose everything. Honestly, it's what I deserve. No, no. It wa-- It was an honest mistake. I was completely lost back there. {\an8}♪♪ I've been trying to make it in the castle, but who are we kidding? I'm a peasant. I always will be. {\an8}♪♪ [ Knock on door ] {\an1}Got a sec? I'm reading. {\an1}You were right. I shouldn't have snaked up those holes. {\an1}It's just, seeing all that change, it made me... Angry. {\an1}...scared. {\an3}Shoveling is all I know, and it's the only way {\an3}I know how to take care of you and your brother. If it goes away, I... {\an1}I don't know what I'll do. Maybe I can teach you how the holes work. Easier said than done. {\an3}I mean, you're young. You pick up things no sweat. It's a lot harder at my age. I've been doing this a long time. I mean, I'm 31 years old. Don't worry, Dad. We got this. {\an8}♪♪ {\an1}[ Sighs ] {\an8}♪♪ [ Clink ] {\an8}♪♪ {\an8}♪♪ "War commences. We return our peace with fury and death. In Brandt's name, we recommence the battle." What the hell happened? And who the [bleep] is Brandt?! Um, Your Highness, uh... this isn't, uh, easy to admit, but the -- the truth is that I -- I screwed it up. {\an3}I blew it, the -- the -- the treaty...thing. The treaty was prearranged. How could you possibly have blown it? Right. How? [ Exhales slowly ] {\an3}Well, what happened is that I -- I -- I grabbed the treaty, and I pulled down my trousers, and I -- I rubbed -- I rubbed my butt on it. And why would you do that? I'm very dumb and stupid. Okay. Let's backtrack a little, shall we? Yeah, sure. You're at the negotiation table. {\an3}Mm-hmm. You took out your butt, and... you physically rubbed it on the treaty. Yeah. Out of nowhere, with no provocation? No, just did it. That's what happened. This is a new low. I mean... [ Scoffs ] ...you suck. -Mm. I will say, it would've been a lot worse were it not for Lord Vexler. Undoubtedly. Vexler, come with me. I'm gonna need your help to sort this mess out. {\an1}Ah, yes, Your Grace. {\an8}♪♪ Oh, hi, Eddie. I guess you're here to shovel. Actually, I'm here to remove the snakes from your hole. Huh? Look, we're expanding the business. That's great! How much? {\an1}This one's on me. {\an8}♪♪ {\an1}Your dad's a good man. Yeah, I'm pretty proud of him. Eddie: Here, snakey. Ow! There's a man-sized snake in here! Got my whole face! [ Snake hissing ] Gonna dump out the last of the snakes. Thanks, kiddo. [ Snakes hissing ] Aah! Oh! Aah! Oh, my God! I'm so sorry! Ugh! {\an1}Prince Chauncley? [ Grunting ] {\an1}Are you okay? Oh, yeah. I'm fine. What are you doing down here? {\an3}Oh, just steering clear of the castle for a bit. My dad is kind of mad at me. {\an1}How mad? {\an3}Well, he told all the servants to keep me from his sight and rid the rooms of "my scent." Yikes. Sounds like you're having some rough luck. Yeah, but, you know, as a prince, I've had nothing but good luck since birth, so I'm probably due for a bit. [ Both laugh ] Eddie: Al, everything okay over there? {\an1}Coming! I should go, but it was nice running into you. Oh, and you, as well. [ Snake hisses ] Oh! Aah! One more. [ Grunts ] [ Exhales ] Right. {\an8}♪♪ Bard: [ Echoing ] ♪ Party, party, party ♪ ♪ Everybody's at the party ♪ ♪ We're all at the party, party, party ♪ {\an8}♪♪ ♪ What's it gotta do with you? ♪ ♪ What's it gotta do with me? ♪ ♪ How can I lose control ♪ ♪ When you're driving from the back seat? ♪ {\an8}♪♪ ♪ When you're driving from the back seat ♪ {\an8}♪♪
