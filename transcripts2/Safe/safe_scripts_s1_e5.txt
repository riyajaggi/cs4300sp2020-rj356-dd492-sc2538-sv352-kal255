 That was the lady from the house on the corner. She made some food. Maybe we should eat something. I'm not hungry. Just come and sit down at the table, and see if you can manage something. Mum? Zoe, please. How is he? Are you all right? He's stable, but... he's lost a lot of blood. We'll have to wait to see if there's any lasting damage. How the hell did this happen? I was trying to find Jenny. Can I have a quick word? Tom, seriously... you've got to leave the investigation to us before you get someone killed. What's gonna happen to Carrie if you end up in intensive care or worse? Just ease up. Stop running at things head-on. Look, we are doing everything we can to find her. It's not enough. What's going on? He's fine. I thought I saw him struggling to breathe, but I think it might just be fluid on his lung. I'll leave you to it. I'll see you in the morning. Yeah, okay. Thanks. See you tomorrow. - Tom? - Who is she? Emma? Emma Castle. Why? Why does it feel like I know her somehow? Darren. Yeah, hold on a sec. Uh, I'm sorry. I've got to take this. I'll meet you at the car. I was looking for Sophie. She's taking a call downstairs. Corrina Castle. Is she related to you? - She was my mum. - "Was"? - Corrina's... - Four years ago. Cancer. I'm sorry to hear that. The three of us were great friends in med school. Until... she left one day... without warning or explanation. It's not a coincidence that you're here. Is it? In this town, in this room. What are you doing here? What are you looking for? It's Pete... isn't it? He's... my dad. I know she stayed in touch with Pete for some time. She never told you about him? I started finding things out after the funeral, from my auntie. I moved here with the intention of just watching him from a distance, figuring out a plan, waiting for the right time, but... he became a suspect in Jenny's disappearance within hours of me joining the department. It might be too late now. I might have lost my chance. Look, he's bruised and damaged right now, but he'll make it. There simply is no other option, okay? And you're gonna find the right time, and you're gonna tell him everything you've ever wanted to. That is gonna blow his mind. But once he's got his head 'round it all, you're gonna find you got yourself a Pete Mayfield for life. They're a loyal breed. It's Sophie. If she finds out I used the databases... I won't tell anyone anything. You're entitled to your secrets. Who were those guys? Who stabbed Pete? I don't know. I swear. I came to see how he was. Who were they? You live around there. - You know them. - Really, I don't. Yeah, I live 'round there, but I keep my head down, just like Rachel told me. I... I found this. Look, that's him, right? - Yeah. - A few cards are still in it. - There wasn't any cash when I found it. - Okay. You saw Jenny the night of the party, right? You spoke to her, right? What did you talk about? I, um... She wouldn't want me to say. You think by not telling me, you're protecting her? She didn't even tell me what it was. Just that she'd found something out. What "something"? Something... Something to do with Rachel. A secret she told Jenny the night she died. What kind of secret? I don't know, man. But it sounded serious. She said you can never find out. That's all I know. Look, man, I really hope you find her, yeah? What are you talking about? A secret. Something Rachel told Jenny on her deathbed set all of this in motion: Chris' death, Jenny going missing, Pete getting stabbed, all of it. What kind of secret? I don't know. I should have been there, Sophie. I should have been there. Where the fuck have you been? Sophie. Hey! - How you doing? Everything all right? - Yeah, yeah. Hey, how's Rach? Not good. And how are you? Come on. The girls... They're astonishing. Handling things much better than I am. All right, enough of the vandalism. Learn how to knit instead. I know how to knit, thank you. Shut up. - No, you don't. - Seriously. I learned when I was doing my residency. I had to improve my manual dexterity, or I wouldn't make it in surgery. So... you want the golden hands, you learn to knit. Wait a second. What? "The golden hands"? The golden hands. Shield your eyes. Mmm... Do you need to go? No, I'm having fun. Hey, excuse me? Is that tequila up there? It is, yeah. - Mmm. - Wow. And again. - Could you pour another one for my friend? - No. Cheers. Wow, Doctor, whatever happened to your golden hands? I usually play better the drunker I get. Move out the way. I'm trying to do my shot. Don't mind me. Seriously, Tom. Just going down the stairs. You're putting me off. Oh, my God! - You're so good at this. - Yeah, really good. I'm sorry. Sorry. - Um, sorry, this isn't... - No, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have. You shouldn't worry... No, it's me. It's me. It's me. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, okay? Shit! Where the fuck have you been? - All right? - Hey. They're in bed, but they definitely aren't asleep. Question: Do 12-year-old girls actually ever stop talking? - No. - Okay. - You coming in? Want a beer? - No, thanks. - Sorry to be so late. - That's all right. - She got a free babysitter, this one. - Yeah, well, babysitters don't usually swan around the house with a beer in their hand, so... She doesn't know the babysitters I know. Any news? I'm afraid not. We'll hear something soon. - Speak tomorrow? - Yeah. Is Uncle Pete gonna be all right? Yes. It feels like when Mum died. Hey. It's not like that. He's... He'll be okay. Carrie... did Jenny ever mention anything about that night when Mum died? Like what? She ever mention a secret? Something Mum might have told her? - A secret? - Yeah. Mum didn't tell me anything. I don't know if she did Jenny. Helen came to see her that night. What? Helen Crowthorne? Yeah. The night Mum died? What was she doing in our house? She was in Mum's room, talking to her when I went in. I couldn't understand how she got in there, but... Mum said it was okay and not to worry. I owe you an apology. - Yeah? - Yeah, your story checks out. - You were helping that girl. - That's what I told you. Wait, why? What did... What did you do? Well, I sent Darren down there to speak to her, and explain that you were being investigated as part of a murder inquiry. Are you fucking serious? You can't... Oh! - What? - Tom. I'm not daft. - Aren't you? - I'm just saying. I'm cool with it. Okay, I don't know what the "it" you are referring to is, but I can promise you one thing. You're definitely not cool. Helen? ♪ One little cig break ♪ ♪ Just give us one little cig break One cigarette... ♪ Oi, Pavarotti! Knock it on the head. Let the rest of us get some peace. You know what? You're absolutely right, pal. He's a genius, this one. What's your name, neighbor? Alan. Alan? My name's Alan, Alan. You are a genius. Can I buy a cig off you, Alan? I've got money. Where's me pants? I've got all me Bitcoins in that... Who's nicked me pants? Give 'em back. Hold up. Did you have pants on when they picked you up? Maybe that's why they picked you up. That's right, Alan! You're right! I said you were a genius, didn't I? What've they got you in for, Alan? I stole an ice cream van. Alan... I really didn't expect that of you. Still, could be worse. They had a bastard in earlier who killed a kid. - What? - Drowned him in his swimming pool. Where'd you hear that? Word gets around. The boy wouldn't give him what he wanted, - if you get me meaning. - What? No, it wasn't anything like that! I heard it was just an accident. It wasn't a kid. He was a teenager. - He was more of an adult. - Listen, this guy's loaded. Big house, swimming pool... But it's never enough, is it? He wants what he can't have: This young lad. And when he's told no, he loses it, drowns the poor lad, so he doesn't tell. Don't you worry, Alan. He'll get his inside. Them types... They never last long in jail, do they? Once word gets out... And word always gets out. I will never understand how a man gets to 44 years old, doesn't know how to tie a tie. I just like you doing it. Voilà. Tilly? How are they treating you, Mr. Marshall? Right then, Mr. "Two Hundred Quid An Hour," we're about to find out just how good you really are. "I, John Joseph Marshall, born 18th December, 1971," of 12 Dockton Lane, Chelton, make this statement freely, admitting my sole responsibility for the death of Christopher Chahal at my home, in the early hours of September the 3rd. Around 11:00 p.m. on the night of the 2nd of September, while spending the night away at Callow Hall Hotel, a celebration of our wedding anniversary, my wife and I received a telephone call from our daughter, concerning a party that had spiraled out of control. "We returned home." Okay. "Leaving my wife in the car,." I arrived through the garden gate, where I encountered Christopher, who appeared to be intoxicated and was acting in a belligerent manner. When I asked him to leave, Christopher became aggressive towards me. A physical altercation ensued, culminating in Christopher losing his balance and falling into the swimming pool. By the time I managed to pull him from the water, Christopher was, regrettably, limp and unresponsive. I attempted to resuscitate him, to no avail. In a complete state of shock, I moved Christopher's body to the garage to spare my wife and daughter the trauma of what I had just witnessed. In the subsequent days, I experienced what I believe to be post-traumatic stress disorder. Anxious and unable to sleep, I... I disposed of Christopher's body at Whitdon Reservoir. My wife and daughter remain, to this day, unaware of my actions. I acted alone. "I wholeheartedly regret my reckless and appalling decisions." So, what are his bloods saying? Okay. Thanks for the update. I'll speak to you later. Was that about Uncle Pete? Yeah. How's he doing? He's... as expected. Is "as expected" good? Yeah. You need to get ready. Carrie, if you're gonna come to the vigil, you need to get ready. - Now. - Okay. - You all right? - Yeah, I'm fine. She'll be down in a sec. Can we get you a drink? - No, thank you. - No. You're early, aren't you? Yes, we needed to come and talk to you both about a development in the investigation. Would you mind taking a seat, please? So, we have someone in custody who claims to be responsible for Chris' death. They've confessed, claiming it was an accidental death, but we would urge caution. We've yet to corroborate their version of events. Who? Who's confessed? Uh, not that. I don't give a shit. It's mine. I'm taking it. This is a hard drive. It's hardly a murder weapon, is it, you jobs-worth tool? I'm a singer. Do you understand? So, obviously, I need this for my music. You can't keep it from me! Will you, for once in your life, stop thinking only of yourself? Your father is in a bloody prison cell because of you! Mum... I'm sorry. I... I'm sorry. Did you do it? Did you, or someone you know, kill that boy? No. No, Mum, I swear to you. I don't know anything about it. "Thank you, everyone, for coming." Zoe, Tilly, and I have been deeply moved "by the affection that you have shown Chris..." "Our..." "hearts..." "Our hearts are broken," but it is a comfort to know we are not alone in our grief. Tilly thoughtfully asked if she could put together this gathering, and we thought it a fitting gesture. We're going to release some balloons shortly, "and welcome everyone to fill out a card with a message for Christopher." To have a child taken from you is truly cruel and awful. Perhaps we should all take a minute... to silently hold Christopher in our thoughts. I don't believe Jojo Marshall's story. No. And if I'm right, then that means that Chris' killer... Could well be here. I need a moment. Zoe? I just need a moment where no one is looking at me. Hey. Henry? Hi. Can you talk a minute? Uh, yeah, I suppose. What's up? I just wanted to ask you about Sia's party. - You were there, right? - Yeah. And you saw Jenny there? Yeah. That was the night she went missing, you know. You talked to her? Uh... A bit. Did she ask about the blood? Blood? On your sweater. Um... Hey, don't walk away from me. I'm talking to you. Let me go. Back in a minute. There is a picture of you, the night of the party, with blood on your sweater. That's odd, right? The night a person gets killed, another goes missing. Wouldn't you say? You're stretching my hoodie, Tom. I don't know anything. Do you remember now? What the hell is going on? It's your son, covered in blood, at Sia Marshall's party, the night Jenny went missing and Chris died. I asked you about that jumper. Mike and Chris got into a fight at the party. Hey! Hey! - Stop. - What's wrong with you, man? I tried to stop it. I pulled them apart. Mike and Chris had a fight? Well, why didn't you mention this before? Henry! It is hard enough trying to fit in and pretend I am normal without having my mum arrest the popular kid because I snitched on him. Look, I'll talk to Mike about this. I'm sorry. I don't know how we missed this. But, Tom, was it really necessary to grab my child and pull him around at his friend's vigil in front of everybody? Carrie! I should go. Sophie. It's Darren. Pathologists have ruled on a time of death for Chris. It's between 10:30 and 11:00 p.m. Lauren and Jojo Marshall were seen on CCTV leaving the hotel at 11:16. He couldn't have done it. Yeah, I'm coming back now. Bye. Hello? Is someone there? Hello? Hello? - Mama? - Tilly. Everything okay? Everything's fine. We're going back home. We're going back home. I overreacted. I'm sorry. I'm a bit, um... I'll apologize to Henry. It wasn't you. Agnes suggested sending off a balloon with a message to Jenny, saying, "Come back home. We love you." But Izzy said, "Don't. She's a murdering cow." Sometimes in life, mean people can say mean things. I'm not upset about what they said. I'm upset that they might be right. This is your sister we're talking about. We're family. It's us three against the world. We know she didn't do it. Do we? Where is she, Dad? It's Ellen. Can I go 'round? Yeah, sure. You and Lauren were recorded leaving the hotel on their CCTV at 11:16 p.m. Right? Our pathologist concluded that Chris Chahal drowned between 10:30 and 11:00 p.m. that night. Which means you were 94 miles away when he died, Jojo. No comment. Why would you confess if you didn't do it? No comment. Because you're her father. And a father would do anything to protect his daughter. It's Sia, isn't it? You're protecting Sia. Chris persuaded her. She didn't want to. He persuaded her. To do what? To sell him the drugs. She didn't know he'd go into the pool. Sia sold Chris drugs the night of the party? And you think what? Chris drowned because of what he'd taken? Chris Chahal's death wasn't drugs-related. He was deliberately and forcibly assaulted. Held under the water until he drowned. But Sia wouldn't... She couldn't. How about you start telling us the truth? Hello? Ben? It's Tom Delaney. I've got an emergency here. Any chance this can wait until next week, dude? I'm in Miami at a convention. No, it can't wait. I wouldn't call if it wasn't an emergency. How do you find where a message came from? Like, immediately. Well, what kind of message? Like a text, e-mail thing. Right, well, e-mail it to me. Okay. Sent. What the fuck? What's happening? You see something? Well, I got the IP address. Well... what is it? How do we track it down? Yeah, I don't need to do that. Ben, I don't... There are 4.3 billion IP addresses in the world. What are the odds that I'd recognize this one? What are you talking about? That IP address. It's yours, dude. That message came from your home network. She's in the house. Are you sure about this? There's no one in the house. I never said "in the house," dude. I said "home network." She's not here. As long as they're in range and have the password, then they can access your signal. Check your phone. You see the little Wi-Fi triangle? That's how you'll know you're in range. Shit. Ben, I'll call you back. Watch out! Sorry. Jenny! Jenny! Jenny! ♪ Lonely shadows following me ♪ ♪ Lonely ghosts come a-calling ♪ ♪ Lonely voices talking to me ♪ ♪ Now I'm gone, now I'm gone Now I'm gone ♪ ♪ Oh, gimme that fire ♪ ♪ Oh, gimme that fire ♪ ♪ Burn, burn, burn ♪
