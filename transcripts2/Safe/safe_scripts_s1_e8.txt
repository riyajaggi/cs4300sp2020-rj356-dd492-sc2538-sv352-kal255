 We just wanted revenge. Rachel, Bobby, come on. We only went there to mess up the classroom. Just stupid fun. But it went too far. Bobby took it too far. It got out of hand. Burn it. - We need to stop it, Rachel. - How? Run! - Oh, shit! - What? Look, camera. Fuck, what do we do? There'll be a tape. It's here. Go. Go.

 Oh, God. There's kids in the school! Fire! Get out! Where's Craig? Where's Craig? Sophie. Sophie! Eight children died that night. We were just kids ourselves. And we were scared. We were so scared. Rachel wanted to go to the police. Helen did. - And you? - I didn't know what to do. Rachel lived with this her whole life. Kept it from me. We vowed, Tom. Once we'd got away with it, once things had moved on, we vowed never to talk about it ever again. Rachel and I spent our lives trying to be... We could have run away, but we didn't. We stayed here and we put something back into the community with our work. And Bobby left. Bobby thought we were mad, sticking around here. Watching the parents of those children that died. We were kids, Tom. We were stupid kids and we made a terrible mistake. We didn't wanna lie to you. Rachel... how could she tell you? How could she tell your girls? She was trying to protect them. How could we tell our children... That we were responsible for that? Jenny found out. She must have. She'd been looking through Rachel's things, and Rachel had been trying to tell us something before she died. Maybe I deserve this. Karma. For what? Oh, just being stupid. Jenny must have known, started digging around. She went to Helen and Bobby. She was going there that night, with Chris, to Heaven, the night he got killed. And now, Helen's dead. You think Bobby killed them? Don't you? So, if he's got Jenny... - He wouldn't. - Why not? What's one more? We have to find him. You have to help me get to him. Okay. Just let me think, all right? Hello? Bobby. Hi, it's Sophie. Sophie Farnbrook? - I need to see you. - About what? About Helen. I know it was you, but I can make it go away. We've got a problem. She kept the tape, the CCTV from the school. Now it's... - No. I've got it. - What? Yeah, I've got it. I'll bring it. Don't worry. The only problem now is Jenny Delaney. - Do you know where she is? - Yeah. She's here. - Where's "here"? - My apartment. Okay, can I come over? I'll text you the address, but like you say... she's a problem. Don't do anything until I get there, okay? We need to figure this out together. Listen to me, Sophie. If you don't come alone, and if you're bringing... I'll be alone. Yes? Could I talk to you? - About what? - My mum. You were at school together. I've been reading Mum's old diaries. Sort of a way to feel close to her. She wrote a lot. I idolized her. Rachel. I wanted to be like her. She was one of those... boys liked her, girls liked her. You look just like her. - A bit. - A lot. When she was your age. Look. There. You're the spit of her. There's me. Do you have a photo of Craig? What? Craig. She talks about him in her diaries. That's him. Was Mum... involved in something? Her diary's kind of cryptic, but she talks about an incident. Says she can't live with it. Remember your mum as you knew her. Anything before that is her business. You spoke to her the day she died. Why did she call you? To say goodbye. She was saying things, after you left. Things that scared me. What kind of things? About people dying. Her mind was confused. Tea? What's Jasmine? Leave me alone. Go home. Hi, babe, you know you found your dad's old porn tapes? Does he still have a VHS player? That's school security footage. 1990. May 17th. Why would she have this? There must be some reason. Stop. That's Helen. That's my mum. And the others? She's kept this all these years. Hidden in her crazy house. This is evidence. Evidence? Of what? School was closed, but there was a sponsored stay-awake on the night of the fire in the common room. Fuck. Fuck. My mum... and the others... they set the fire. But a guy was arrested, wasn't he? Some drunk. Ray Barton. Drug addict, vagrant. Seen near the area. This makes no sense. Look, if your mum and the others did it, if... It looks like they were never caught. Wait, hang on. Look at this. "Craig Pratchett, 16-year-old student", risked his own life by entering the burning building to try to save the younger children. "Critical condition." Craig. Him? Okay, third from the end. "Archie 'Bobby' Roberts." I think Mum mentions a Bobby in her diary. And then there was one. It's hard. They're all so blurry. They're the only ones with hair like that. Okay, give me both their names. All right, middle row, three in... - Cassandra Wyatt. - Mmm-hmm. And then, bottom row, second to last, Sophie Farnbrook. - Sophie? - What? Oh, my God, it is. Sophie. Henry's mum. The cop. The bitch that arrested me? We should talk to her. And say what? "Did you and my mum burn down the school?" - She's a cop. - Exactly! She's a fucking hypocrite. She lectures me for possession and she's involved in this shit. - We can't. - Why not? Chris, we just can't. She's seeing my dad. They're shagging. Okay. You've already tried Helen, so let's start with Archie Roberts. We'll go to Sia's party for a couple hours, show our faces. Then we'll head to the train. - You think he'll be there? - He's the owner. We'll leave him a message if not. - I saw Sophie this morning. - What? - I swung by her house. - Chris! She needs to know we know. Did you speak to her? No, but I will. - She killed kids. - Yeah, with my mum. Your mum wasn't a cop. - Chris. - She's a liar. She's pretending to be something that she's not. Look, we are finding this out for me. Not for revenge or justice. Because I need to know. I know. But she's there, on our doorstep. She knows the truth. I don't understand why you won't let me ask her. - I... - I want to ask her. Where are you going? Just out with some friends. - Have you seen Chris? - No. - Have you seen Chris? - No. Sorry, babe. Where the fuck are you? Excuse me. I'm looking for Bobby, the owner. Why do you want him? He's a friend of my mum's. He's not around. You want my advice? Stay away from him. Will you give him a note? Hi, this is Jenny. Leave a message after the beep. Jen, it's Dad. Where are you? I know the truth. About you and Mum. About the fire. You're the only other person in the world to have seen that tape. I told the others I'd destroyed it, but I couldn't. Something made me keep it. The best I can explain is... things in the past... if you push them away long enough, if you say they never happened, then... they never happened. You convince yourself. But the tape... that was proof. That always told me what we'd done... was real. My mum, it haunted her to the end. Excuse me. Have you seen this girl? Sorry... Round here? Today? Yesterday? - I don't remember her, no. - Okay. You should go home. I can't. My dad hates Chris. He's been bugging my phone. I don't know how to tell him about all this. My mum. I can't do it yet. Helen, hi. We're asking everyone when they last saw Jenny Delaney. Why? Has something happened? She's been reported missing. Children have so much freedom these days. Have you seen her in the last couple of days? No. I don't know, last week? That's fine, thank you. - If you see or hear anything... - Is she in danger? We found her boyfriend's body today. We're obviously very worried about her. Oh, dear. I had nothing to do with it. I swear. He had a fight that night at the party, but who would do this? Who would kill him? Did he know what you knew? About our secret? Hello? Zoe, Tilly, and I are deeply moved by the affection you have shown Chris. Hello? Hello? - Where is she? - Inside. She knows the truth. Rachel's gone. I don't care. I'm telling you so you can run, if you wanna run. It's coming out, Bobby. I want it to come out. I want people to know. There's a woman here. She's dead. I've been to Bobby's apartment. I know the layout. I'll admit to the fire, Tom. When we get Jenny back, I'll go and admit the truth. But whatever happens, promise me you'll help out with my kids. If I'm not around. - Soph... - Please. Promise me. You'll help Josh. I promise. Thank you. Come on up. Bobby? Bobby? Here alone? - Yes, of course I'm here alone. - Where's the tape? It's safe. Put the fucking gun down. Are you out of your mind? What the fuck are you doing? Why should I trust you? I've got as much to lose as you. More. Where's Jenny? Bedroom. All right. Look, she's the only person still alive that knows the truth. You think I wanna do this? But what's the option? I can't go down, Sophie. Helen wanted it to come out. I lost it with her. All right, she's missing, yeah? She's been reported missing. Jenny. Everyone thinks she's run away. So she doesn't come back. Because kids disappear all the time, right? - So, how? - Um... Quick, painless. She won't even realize it's coming. Then we get rid of... If we're gonna do this, we should do it. You distract her. Hey. Your dad's worried sick. So we need to talk. Can I sit with you for a bit, yeah? - I want to go home. - Definitely. But first, we should talk about what you discovered. And the fire. She kept a diary. And I went to see Helen. She had the tape, the CCTV. And that's when me and Chris started... And then someone killed him. The school fire was a terrible thing, and me and your mum and Bobby never wanted it to get out. We were so scared. But that doesn't mean we haven't paid for it. Every single one of us. Having that guilt. Seeing those families. It doesn't leave you, Jenny. It never leaves. No! Dad! Dad! Dad! No! You fucking lied! I'm sorry, Bobby. - I never wanted to kill her. - I know. You should never have come to me. What did you hope would happen? I don't know. I don't know. No! Bobby, please. Please. She's Rachel's daughter. How did we get here? Nothing stays hidden forever. The truth always comes out. No! Oh, God. Oh, God. It's okay. You're okay. It's okay. It's okay. Don't confess. What? What good will it do? I can tell them the truth, but keep your name out of the fire. Tell them it was all about Bobby. - Maybe it's time. - Why? Think of Henry, Ellen. I never wanted you punished. I've hidden the tape. I'll say it was destroyed in Helen's fire. Bobby then pointed the gun at Jenny Delaney, her father, Tom Delaney, then at me. I had every reason to suspect that he would use the weapon against Tom and Jenny Delaney. The night Chris Chahal died was the night that you planned to visit Bobby at Heaven Lounge. But at this point, Bobby had no inkling you knew about his involvement in the school fire. You'd stolen the tape, the CCTV tape, from Helen. Yeah, she might have told him. So, the tape was destroyed in Helen's fire? Is it possible Chris contacted Bobby before you planned to visit him? He was getting pretty crazy about the whole thing, wanting to confront people. But I don't think so. We had a plan. What I'm struggling to understand is how Bobby, assuming that he knew about the CCTV tape, would know you were at Sia Marshall's party, and why he would choose to confront Chris there. It's such an unlikely place. Especially if he planned to kill him. I should never have got him involved. If I hadn't dragged him into this, he'd still be alive. Okay. I think that's enough for now. She needs to rest. I'm sorry. It's too soon. - We can pick this up tomorrow. - No, you're right. It makes no sense. It doesn't make any sense. Why would he come to the party? Can I ask you one last thing? Mmm-hmm. Do you recognize this pendant? It was found at the crime scene. I changed my mind. Hey. You need to confess. What? To the murder of Chris Chahal. Am I right? No more lies now, Sophie. Just say the words. Did you kill Chris Chahal? They found your pendant at the scene. It was you, wasn't it? I didn't mean to. You know I would never... Like you didn't mean to kill those kids in the fire? - What? Let's just back up... - You killed a boy! Someone's child. Zoe's child. You saw her. It destroyed her. He was gonna tell everybody. I had to stop him, but he wouldn't wait. And he wouldn't listen to me. - So you killed him? - No, I didn't mean to. What if it had been Jenny? What if she'd confronted you? Tom, I love you. You... I didn't want anyone to find out the truth about me. I didn't want you to know because we had a shot at something. And my kids, how could they know? Did Jenny really wanna know about Rachel? No one wants to know that about their parents. I was just trying to keep them safe. I only went to the party to get Henry. He'd sneaked out and I knew that he'd been drinking. That's why I went, because I didn't want him to get worse. You have to believe me. I just went there to get my boy. Hey. What do you want? Is Henry inside? Yeah. You been fighting? Ease up on the weed and whatever else you've got inside you. Fuck off! About time you went home, isn't it? Or what? You gonna arrest me? It's crossing my mind. Big fucking cop. I know about you, about all your shit. So fucking arrest me, I dare you. School fire? You and the others. Sorry. I've got no idea what you're talking about. Thought that one was gone, didn't you? Thought no one would find out. Except, she confessed, Jenny's mum, on her deathbed. Whatever she said... Don't fucking lie to me. Don't look me in the face and lie to me. I know. I've got proof. What proof? A tape. Security tape from that night. Showing you all, all five of you, in the school, running away after you set that fire. - There is no tape. - Yeah. Helen had it. She kept it all these years. Souvenir. I'm gonna show it to the police. - Look, Chris... - People died. Kids died. You can't just get away with that. - It was an accident. - Bullshit! You started a fire. To get back at a teacher. - We were stupid. We were kids. - And other kids died. Chris, you can't, all right? It's done, it's over. Okay, I've got children, a sick child. It would destroy him. He needs me. Just think what good would this do, Chris? Really? Please. The tape. A confession. I've got everything I need. Chris, please. Come on. God! How could you just carry on? And act like you didn't just kill a kid? Because I had to. To hold my family together. But every night, in my house, on my own... The guilt. Knowing what I'd done. God, I'm not... I'm not a killer, Tom. I'm not. And if I go to prison, who's it gonna help? It could so easily have been Rachel. No. It couldn't. Tom, look at me. Look at me. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you, too. So Rachel would want us to be happy, wouldn't she? Wouldn't she? - I'm sorry. - What? What? No, Tom, please. Please. No, please, Tom, please. We have to put this right, Sophie. No more secrets. This whole mess was caused by things being buried away. I can't be a part of it anymore. Emergency. Which service do you require? Police. I'm with someone who has confessed to the murder of Chris Chahal. Oh, God. They're obviously not here. Zoe, can we come in, please? A physical altercation ensued, culminating in Christopher losing his balance and falling into the swimming pool. Lauren and Jojo Marshall were seen on CCTV leaving the hotel at 11:16. He couldn't have done it. We've got a kid at the front desk. He wants to confess to the murder of Chris Chahal. We know you hit Chris, but it didn't kill him. He died from water inhalation. He drowned.
