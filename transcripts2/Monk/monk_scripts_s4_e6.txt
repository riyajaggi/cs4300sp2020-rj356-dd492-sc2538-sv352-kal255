 [Ticking Loudly] [Ticking Continues] Excuse me. It's 2:00. The doctor's just running a little late. Okay. No problem. How late is he running? Did he say? Just a few minutes. It won't be long. All right. Listen, does he- Does he know I'm here? Maybe I could just pop in and tell him- Uh, l- I don't think that's such a good idea, Mr. Monk. No. Where's Natalie? She's out.

 She's running some errands. Would you like to call her? Let's call her. [Phone Ringing] Hello, Mr. Monk. Natalie, it's me. Adrian-you know, Monk. - Yes, Mr. Monk. I know. - Doctor Kroger's running late. Then you'll have something to talk about, won't you? Do you need me to come over? I'm five minutes away. Where are you? You know, I don't even know. I'm at some coffee shop. Did you find that toothbrush? Yes, sir. Had to go to about five drugstores, but I found it. The Gertler 4000- [Whispering] With the extra-soft polyurethane bristles?

 Yes, and the blue rubber handle. Yes, sir. Thank God. What about Trudy's picture? I just came from the frame shop. I got that too. How does it look? - You know, they did a really good job. You can't even see that scratch. - Excellent. She really was pretty. - Yes, she was. - Are you sure you're okay? Maybe I should just come over. No. No, no. You know what? I'm okay. In fact, I'm gonna be fine. Okay. Well, have a good session. And I'll be there when you get out. Thank you. [Bell On DoorJingling] Trudy? Tru-Trudy. [No Audible Dialogue] Hi. How are you, Zach? Nice to see you. Sorry I'm a little late. ## [Up-tempo Folk] # It's a jungle out there # # Disorder and confusion everywhere # # No one seems to care # # Well, I do Hey, who's in charge here # # It's a jungle out there # # Poison in the very air we breathe # # Do you know what's in the water that you drink, well, I do # # And it's amazing # # People think I'm crazy 'cause I worry all the time # # If you paid attention you'd be worried too # # You better pay attention or this world we love so much # # Mightjust kill you # # I could be wrong now # # But I don't think so # # 'Cause it's a jungle out there # # It's a jungle out there ## Adrian, I'm sorry to have kept you waiting. Maggie said that you were getting a little anxious out there? That's true. I'm pretty excited. Hmm. I have some news. Really? As you know, yesterday was Trudy's birthday. I went to the grave. Then I came home, and I reread some of her poems. There was this one passage that really got to me. [Stammering] L-I just kept rereading it. It goes, "The snows that burn away... "like tears of God reveal the world anew. "We are reborn. Nothing is lost forever." It's beautiful. Yeah. Nothing is lost forever. [Sighs] It was as if... she was speaking to me. Mm-hmm. Like she was saying, I'm here without her... for a reason. I think- I think she wants me to let go. Wow. I know. Yeah. [Chuckles] Wow. And then yesterday, the radio was playing a song, but it wasn't the radio. It wasn't the radio? #There are chicks # #Just right for some kissin' # #And I mean # #To kiss me a few ## You know what it was? It was me. You. It was me. I was singing. Right. [Chuckles] I think I'm happy. [Sighs] Is that possible? Why not? It's so long overdue. [Chuckles] Happy! Yes. I'm happy. Yes, yes. And then this morning, I looked up- There was a picture on the wall. It was a little crooked. I just kept eating. I didn't get up and fix it. L-I know. Because the glass here on the table? You still haven't put it back on the coaster. What do you think? What do you think? Every time I say "What do you think?" You say "What do you think?" Well, what do you think? [Chuckling] I'm almost afraid to say it. I think I might be getting better. Adrian, reading the poem- the reaction you had to it- it-it's what we call a threshold event. It's a big first step. First steps are the hardest. You okay? Yeah, yeah. It's just been, like, such a long time that I've been waiting. Just so- Oh, thank you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm crying. I'm sorry. Does it make you uncomfortable? Yes, it does. Hmm. But what doesn't? Did you tell anybody about me? Where's our waitress? She just disappeared. Zach- Mr. Ellinghouse, this is very important. Did you tell anybody else about me? Who would I tell? Janice is gone. She's all I had. I don't like this cloak-and-dagger stuff, Trudy. Well, believe me. It's for your own good. And... remember I asked you not to call me Trudy. Call me Lisa. Oh, yeah. I'm sorry. Lisa. I still don't understand why you had to fake your own death. I was protecting my family. I was writing an article about an extremist group in the Bay Area, and they were looking for me. They would have killed me and my husband for sure if they'd found me. The only way to stop 'em was to pretend I was dead. Oh. Here we go. Tuna fish sandwich, and a coffee and one cinnamon stick. Cinnamon stick? Yeah, to sweeten it. It's a little trick I picked up in Madrid. Oh, that's right. You and Janice went to Madrid. I have all the letters she wrote. I kept everything. I know you did. That's why I'm here, Zach. Hey, great sandwich. They got little pieces of celery in this. Do you want some? No. I can't. I'm allergic to fish. Oh, that's right. I remember. I remember everything... eventually. We need to talk, Zach, about the key- the key thatJanice left you. Do you have it? Oh, I still can't believe she's gone. Yeah, I know. I know it hurts. I miss her too. This is-This is very important. Do you have the key? Look, I looked for it. I couldn't find it. I'll look for it tonight. I prom- I'll find it. I promise. Okay. I'll meet you on Keep Street, in front of the library tomorrow. Do you know where that is? Yeah. 10:00. 10:00. Zach, don't let me down. It's my key. Janice wanted me to have it. [Monk] #There is wine all ready for tastin' # A little mayonnaise. #And Cadillacs so shiny and new # Some lemon juice. A little salt-just a pinch. Just a sprinkle. # Da, da, da ## Oh, Kevin, I really appreciate this. Oh, stop. This is what neighbors are for. [Chuckles] Is that enough? How many people are coming? I... don't know. Well, the captain has this barbecue every year but, uh, I've never felt like going before. Oh, so this is like your coming out party. Like my coming- Natalie, are you okay? Yeah. I'm just tired. Yeah. Okay, for the record, this one is a little uneven, but I don't care. I'm gonna use it anyway. Okay. The old me would have obsessed with making it- So hold on. All right. Okay. But now I'm gonna let it go. Lettin' it go. I'm lettin' it go. It's gone. It's done. All right. Just one second. One more. Done. Done. Done. Mr. Monk? Yeah. I spoke with Julie's doctor today, and he said she might be allergic to fish. Oh? Oh. Poor kid. Yeah. Do you know anybody else who's allergic to fish? I think the man who lives across the street from my sister... is allergic to fish. Not right across the street. Actually, you know what? It's not even really a street. It's more of a cul-de-sac. That's great, Kevin. How about you, Mr. Monk? No. Well, Trudy was. Oh, I didn't tell you the best part. Here's the best part. Hmm. Dr. Kroger is gonna call the department and recommend me for reinstatement. That's-That is- Great. Congratulations. Hey, I know. Later, let's get my old uniform down and see if it fits. I'll tell you something. It's not gonna fit if you eat too much of this. [Both Laughing] It's never gonna fit. Hey, I met somebody who said he knew you. Zach Ellinghouse? Ellinghouse? Right. Oh, Trudy used to work with his daughter. How's he doing? He's fine. Good. Mr. Monk? Yeah. There's something I have to tell you. Okay. It's good potato salad. What do you mean you don't have it? I thought we had a deal. Trudy, don't get mad. I'm just talking about some compensation. [Sighs] I don't know where that key goes. Maybe it's to something really valuable. No, no. It's not valuable, Zach. I told you. It's- It's just some research that Janice and I did together, okay? It's just some old papers. - [Shutter Clicks] - [Ellinghouse] You're really anxious about it, and- [Clears Throat] L- I have expenses, you know? I mean, bills. - [Shutter Clicks] - Janice isn't here to help me. Who's gonna help me? Okay, you want some money. - So, tell me how much. Give me a number. - A thousand dollars. It's not that much. Fine. I'll have it today. I'll be at your house at 3:00. And, Zach, I am not leaving without that key. [Gasps] What are you doing? Who are you? Natalie Teeger. I work for your- I work for Adrian. I need that camera. Just please tell me what's going on. Have you told Adrian about me? Don't. You can't. If you care about him at all, you can't tell him. We both know this would kill him. I'm dead. I have to stay that way. Understand? ## [Rock] [Chattering] [Man] Sweetheart, let your sister have a turn. [Stottlemeyer] Whoops. [Growls] Okay. How about that one? That one? Yeah. That one. ## [Continues] Now what was wrong with that one? Oh, that was lopsided. Here, you do the buns. Switch. Hey, guys. Well-done, please. Well-done. Bun. Need a bun. The bun. Thanks. Okay, that- That's a little off center. I could- I could reposition that for you. Or you know what? I'm gonna- I'm gonna l- I'm gonna let it go. You enjoy it. Life is too short. [Chuckles] We're- Let's let it go. Okay. Thanks. You know, the commissioner asked me... what I thought about bringing you back on a contingency basis. I told him I thought we should try it. [Whispering] Captain- No. Don't say anything. Okay. We'll take it one day at a time, okay? Excuse me. [Sighs] Oh, listen. There's a- There's a few things that I should say that I don't. I mean, I've been working on a few things myself. Well, you're not perfect, God knows, but... you're still probably the best cop I've ever met. And working with you has been one of the great honors of my life. You're the man. And I mean that. Right back at ya, sir. I love you, man. Yeah, I love you too. Oh, yeah. He said I was the man. He was getting all teary. Really? Wow. [Disher] Not that it's competition or anything, it's just nice to be number one. Excuse me. Hey, Paulie? It's a red alert. Tell Karen that we're almost out of beer. Captain, do you have a minute? Sure. Uh, gosh, I know this sounds weird, but... were you there when Trudy died? Who? Trudy Monk? No, no. I got there an hour later. Why? So, you didn't actually see the body? What are you getting at? I met her... this morning. I talked to her. Finally. Here's your money. You can count it if you want. [Clears Throat] I've changed my mind. What are you talking about? We had a deal. MyJanice gave me this key. She didn't leave it for you. Why do you think she did that? Well, she couldn't leave it to me, could she? Huh? She thought I was dead. I've decided to leave all her papers and her notebooks to the university. Zach-Zach- Janice and I worked on that story together. Those papers belong to both of us. [Sighs] L-I don't know. I have to think. This isn't a game! Give me the key! Trudy, what are you doing? Give me the key. Stop it! Trudy! Just give it to me! - [Groaning] - Zach? [Stottlemeyer] It's not possible. It's impossible. She said she faked her own death to protect him. She talked to a paramedic before she died. Okay, but maybe he was lying. Or-Or maybe he was in on it. Captain, I've been following her. She's been meeting a man, this older guy named Zach Ellinghouse. Do you know him? Ellinghouse? No. Yeah, they've been arguing about a key. He has some key that belongs to her. How many of those have you had? Captain, I saw Trudy Monk. Did you take her picture? Yeah, but she took the film. [Disher] Captain.! Yeah, okay. We just caught one in Mission Hill. - Now? - Neighbor heard a fight. Door was open. She went in, found a body. Karen's gonna kill me. But, all right, uh, grab Philby and Dietrich. All right, uh, 418 Vinton, Apartment 3-D. - Victim's name was Ellinghouse. - Ellinghouse? Yeah, Zachary Ellinghouse. Why? You know him? Hey, what's going on? Nothing. We're rolling. There's a fresh one in Mission Hill. All right, let's go. I'm in. No. Hey, hey, hey, Monk. Look, we don't need you on this one. I want you to stay here. Look, uh, clean the grill. The grill is really greasy. Yeah. What? Yeah, yeah, come on. It'll be fun. What are you talking about? I'm getting my badge back. I'm back on the team, right? Come on, uh, let's go. I'm in. Let's lock and load. [Coughing] Oh, it's really dusty in here. Mr. -Mr. Monk, maybe you should wait in the car. No, no, no. I'm fine. You know, Monk, we can't pay you for this. Oh, it's on the house. Least I could do. Yeah, here we go. Body was here? Yeah. Looks like he was on the desk, face down. Uh, he fell onto this thing, rolled over onto the floor. What do you call that thing? Spindle. Spindle. God, that's it. Finish my report. The rug was like this. Yeah. Looks like he tripped. Wasn't premeditated. Oh, there was a struggle... with a woman. A woman? How do you know that? Heel marks in the carpet. Oh, she had very small feet. A lot of women have small feet. She wore perfume. Shalimar. Trudy wore Shalimar. Wait. No reading glasses. I think he kept something stashed in this book. - A key. Did they find a key? - No. No, nothing. Maybe they were fighting over that. [Disher] Look at this. It's her mug- lipstick. Oh, yes. [Sniffing] Cinnamon- to sweeten the coffee. Trudy used to do that. Is this the victim? Yeah. His name's Zach- Zach Ellinghouse. Oh, no! I knew him. Ellinghouse, Natalie. You were just asking me about him. Captain, his daughter, Janice, used to work with my- Trudy. It's weird you keep mentioning Trudy. There was a witness who heard a struggle. L-Lieutenant, let me- let me- What's this? "Witness distinctly heard victim say, 'What are you doing, Trudy?"' [Whispers] Trudy. That was Trudy's name. Mr. Monk, there's something I need to tell you. Yeah. Lf... Mitch were... somehow still alive, I'd want somebody to tell me. Tell you what? What? What are you talking about? It's Trudy. She's not- She's not dead, Mr. Monk. Trudy? I've been following her. I talked to her. [Scoffs] Well, this is- I mean, that-This is just- Monk. Hey, Monk. Monk, I don't believe it either, okay? But we don't know what's going on. Captain- Look, M-Maybe if we just got- if we got a sample of her D.N.A. No. No! No, that way we'd know where we stand. Trudy's D.N.A.? What are you saying? Maybe we could just exhume the body. Look, we're miles away from exhuming anything. She said she faked her own death to protect you. She's alive, Mr. Monk. [Gasping] Trudy. Trudy! [Tires Screeching] Trudy. Monk, was it her? He's not sure. She was too far away. Did you make the car? S-Sedan. Gray sedan. What kind of sedan? Did you see the driver? The license number? He doesn't remember. [Sighs] Is there anything I can do? Is there anything... I can do? [Sighs] Okay. Excellent. [Disher] Good. How's he doing? How do you think he's doing? I have never felt more helpless in my life. Well, I just spoke to Hank Merchant at the D.A.'s office. Wait. Did I authorize that? No, sir. I figured you wouldn't mind. I'm the man, remember? [Sighs] I laid everything out for him, and he thinks we have enough to exhume the body. You just have to say the word. Look, hey, no, no. We're not digging anything up without Monk's okay. Look- Let's just give him a day or two, okay? Captain. Doctor, thank God you're here. Oh, Natalie called my service. What's going on? [Stottlemeyer] There is some evidence to suggest... that Monk's wife, Trudy, may still be alive. Excuse me? We think she faked her own death and has been hiding out ever since. And we're pretty sure she killed a guy earlier today. Trudy's our primary suspect. All right. All right. So he's having a psychotic break. He's delusional. No. He's not delusional. We have two eyewitnesses... and some physical evidence. This- Th-Th-This is big. Excuse me. Dr. Kroger. Mr. Monk, look who's here. It's Dr. Kroger. Natalie, give us a minute, please. Adrian, um- Here. You have to drink something. Did you drink something? You got it? You got it? Okay. Adrian. Okay. [Whispers] Good. Adrian, I'm not going to believe anything until I hear it from you. Is Trudy alive? I don't know. But if it's true, then nothing is true. If this is true, nothing is true. Why didn't she contact me? I don't know. I don't know. Maybe she's in trouble. She's in trouble. A-Adrian, where are you going? [Kroger] Adrian? Hey, Monk? Monk, where are you going? I have to find her. We'll go with you. No. I have to do this alone. This is between me and my wife. [Sobs] She's not you. It's not you. [Exhales] Hi. How you doing? Hi. My wife is buried back there. [Sighs] She's still dead. [Exhales] She's right where I left her. Okay. And I am so... relieved. I mean, I love her with all my heart, but- [Sighs] Who's this? This is my husband. Ah. I'm sure he's dead too. And he'll stay dead. Don't worry about that. This is an excellent cemetery. They know what they're doing. Everybody here- probably dead. Nice talking to you. [Phone Ringing] That's it, there. Trudy's desk? For five years. She loved this job. I did that. I was leaning in to kiss her, spilled some coffee. [Chuckles] I bet it was the last time you spilled anything in your life. Oh, I spilled something seven years later- January 12, 1999. January 12? You mean during the earthquake? Earthquakes count. I don't make the rules. Mr. Monk, could I ask you something? What happened yesterday in the cemetery? How do you know the woman we've been seeing isn't Trudy? We still have one or two copies in the archives. You can keep that one. I don't understand. Why would anybody want to impersonate Trudy? I don't know. I wish some of these kids would impersonate her a little bit. She was the best reporter I ever knew. Here it is- "Peer Pressure" byJanice Ellinghouse and Trudy Monk. It was the only article they ever wrote together. It's a hell of a piece. It should have won a Pulitzer. Yeah. - It was on the dockworkers' union? - Ed Lindley, the union president, was indicted because of that. He's still in jail. That's right. The guy was untouchable. But Trudy and Janice never stopped digging. That article made history. Lindley's second-in-command, Jack Bollinger, became the union president because of this. He's still there. Seems to be running a pretty clean shop. Whoa, they are really naming names here. Look at all these payoffs. How did they get all this? Hard work and a secret informant. Deep background. Trudy never told me who it was. Well, they never told me either. Where was Janice's desk? Over there. Still haven't cleaned it out yet. It's, uh, hard to say good-bye. Yes, it is. - "Pay rent." - Yeah, so? She was already paying a mortgage. What could she be renting? What-What-What can you rent for a hundred and five dollars? I rent a storage locker. It costs about that much per month. The missing key- the one from the book. It could have opened a locker. Mr. Monk, there are hundreds of storage lockers in San Francisco. Where would we even start? Well, Natalie, how about Trans-Cal Moving and Storage, 13025 Third Street? What? Th-This storage place- what time does it open? [Trudy] 8:00. I'm gonna need you to come along with me. Why? You said once I got you the key, I could leave. Change of plans. I don't know what kind of security they're gonna have. If we're stopped, I'm gonna need you to pretend to beJanice. Oh, and bring that along. She was a blonde too. I hate this thing. Why? It looks pretty good on you. Then, you looked pretty good as the redhead in that show. What was it called again? A man is dead. Yeah, I know that. And I am sorry. It was a terrible accident. And that other guy-Trudy's husband. I will never forget his face. I mean, he was really hurting. Look, things happen. We're moving on. This is all about self-preservation now. Do you understand? If whatever is in that storage locker ever gets out, I am a dead man. I can't do this. Yes, you can. Look-Look. You're an actress, aren't you? Well, our little show is not over yet. [Chattering] [Stottlemeyer] Good morning. What's going on? Organizing a task force. Out of my office? Yes, sir. Well, I figured you wouldn't mind. I'm the man, right? Yeah, that's right. You're the man. Don't worry, sir. I am all over this one. I've reassigned Rudner and Sergeant Hyden. They're already on their way in. The report from the lab. There were no identifiable prints in the apartment. Trudy must have wiped everything down before she left. I'm running off 5,000 of those- "Wanted for Questioning." I put a photo of her up on the hot board, and I've been trying to contact her parents. W-Wait, are you- Wait. You've been trying to contact whose parents? Trudy's. In case she tries to call them. No, Randy. Wait, wait, wait- And I'm, uh, releasing that to the press. It's a press release. Oh, uh, I called the deputy commissioner too. Just want- Lieutenant! Excuse me, gentlemen. [Groans] Randall, when I said that about- about you being the man, I thought I was talking to Monk. Oh. Okay. Well, that explains it. Randy, it doesn't mean that I don't appreciate- No, l-I understand. No problem. Why don't I just get you a cup of coffee? Won't be needing that. [Sighs] It's number 12. Number 12. How do you know? I saw the list. The security guard just showed you the list? Not exactly. I caught a glimpse of it as he was bending over. Why was he bending over? To help me look for my earring. [Gasps] I lost my earring. Oh, my God. It's irreplaceable. It was a gift from my Aunt Lisa on her deathbed. I think it might have fallen over there. Maybe she's already been here. No. There's water in the handle from the rain last night. It would have spilled out if she lifted the door. Listen. Listen. [Monk] That's the car I saw. It's gotta be her. Come on. It's her. It's her. Mr. Monk, they're gonna see you. What are you doing? Get down. I had her back. [Sighs] For an hour and a half, I thought she might be alive. Psst. [Exhales] I had hope. Isn't hope the worst? No, Mr. Monk. Hope is a good thing. You're very young. I know this guy. I've seen him before. Do you have the article that Trudy and Janice wrote? Yeah. [Natalie] Yeah. That's him. Jack Bollinger. - The union boss. - He was their anonymous source 10 years ago. Now that they're both gone, he must be panicked... that all of their research material will be made public. And his old friends will know that he ratted them out. What about the woman? Bollinger must have just found her. It was a con game to trickJanice's father into giving up that key. I don't get it. How did she know so much about Trudy? Bollinger must have coached her. He spent time with Trudy when they were writing this, so he knew a lot about her. I'm calling the captain. [Stottlemeyer] Lieutenant, we're rolling. That was Natalie. Monk broke the case. They're at a storage locker right up the street. Randy. Randy! Let's go. Oh. Oh, I'm sorry. Were you talking to me? [Sighs] It's just hard to tell sometimes. Randy, you know how fragile Monk is. I have to stroke him all the time. But you're tougher than that. Come on. You're the man. Let's go. Oh, so everybody's the man. No. Just you and Monk. You're my two men. Let's go. If we were both drowning, who would you save? I don't know- both of you. No, if you could only save one of us. I'd probably save Monk because he can't swim, and I know you're an excellent swimmer. Suppose I was holding an anchor? You're holding an anchor? Uh-huh. Who would you save then? Well, why don't you let go of the anchor? It's a family heirloom. I'm leaving. Mr. Bollinger, can I go now? Go start the car. No, no. Mr. Monk, it's not Trudy. Let's just wait for the captain. Just- Stay here. What the hell are you doing? I found some notebooks and some tapes, but they're not all labeled, and... I can't afford to miss anything. So we... are going to Plan B. Oh, Mr. - - Mr. Bollinger, you can't do that! I don't want anyone else getting hurt. - Start the damn car! Trudy? - What the hell is he doing here? - I'm her husband. Son of a bitch, it never ends. H- How did he find us? Who else knows we're here? Hey, I'm talking to you. Your hair- hair was more like- like- [Stammering] Look, l-I didn't know, okay? L-I thought this was just a job. First row, number 12! [Tires Screeching] You, freak show, get away from her. No, Mr. Bollinger, don't. Trudy, listen. Okay, that is enough! No, no, no! Don't! Don't.! They're gonna find a body in the ashes here.! I have no choice! He knows too much! - Oh, God. - [Stottlemeyer] Hey.! [Yelps] [Groaning] [Panting] Oh, I'm so sorry. You loved her. I'll tell her. [Natalie] Well, I think it stinks. What stinks? The department deciding not to reinstate you. They didn't even give you a chance. You can't really blame them. After what happened, I'm kind of back to- What? Normal? Well, to- to kind of normal. Uh- What? Wait a second. Uh, I touched that one twice. I have to- You know, Mr. Monk, you never told me. What happened in the cemetery? How did you know that that woman wasn't really Trudy? Well, I went to the grave, and it still hurt. So I knew. Yeah, I know that hurt. It's never wrong. Nope. It isn't. Neither are you.
