 # 'Cause it's a jungle out there # # It's a jungle out there ## Okay, this one is... okay. This one- This is good. Okay, Mr. Monk, really. You don't have to wash 'em. They're just gonna get recycled. They're just gonna get all smushed together. You may be right. This one's still sticky. We'll wash that again. [Doorbell Rings] Are you gonna get that? [Chuckles] Natalie? [Doorbell Rings] Hello. Mr. Monk- There's someone here to see you. She says she's an old friend. SherryJudd? [Can Clatters] Sherry? Sh- She's here? What does she want? I don't know. Who is she? Someone I knew in the eighth grade. Is she here to apologize? I don't know. Well, tell her it's too little too late. No, wait! Uh- Tell her about Trudy. Tell her I married Trudy. Tell her Trudy loved me. Tell her how pretty Trudy was. Uh, wait. Tell her Trudy and I went all the way. Mr. Monk, I think she needs your help. With her homework? No. With a case. We're all... grown-up now. Oh, yeah. Right. Uh, Sherry? Hello. It's- I'm Adrian... Monk. Adrian. Oh. You-You look great. Um, y-you probably don't even remember me. Is that Trudy? She was beautiful. Um, Natalie told me what happened. I'm- I'm so sorry. Thank you. We went all the way. Please. Won't you have a seat? Can I offer you anything? Um, we have bottled water and, uh- Pushin' the bottled water. I'm fine, thanks. Um, where to begin? Uh, I've been living in Seattle. Um, we just moved back three years ago. We? My husband and I. - Ah. - Michael. Um, we're recently divorced. Oh! I'm so sorry. No, no, it's- it's- It's for the best, believe me. So, it's, uh, just been me and my housekeeper, Gladys. That's why I'm here. Sunday night, someone broke in. I guess Gladys woke up. Um, there must have been a fight. And, um, they killed her. Oh- Oh, my God. Are you okay? No- I wasn't home. Adrian, I'm the only family Gladys had. I just want justice, for her. L- I wanna make sure that the best people are working on this. And l-I've been asking around, and everyone says you're a genius. But, of course, I already knew that. Adrian, um, helped me out of a jam when we were kids. - Oh. - About, uh, what? Thirty years ago? April 12, 1972. You remember? I only remember the date. And what everybody wore. And what everybody said, and what everybody did. Here it is. WestoverJunior High, 1972. Natalie, don't- don't open that! Natalie, put that back. I command you. [Gasps] Sherry, you were so cute. Okay, now where is Mr. Monk? Natalie! Just close the book! I mean it. Natalie. Natalie. Okay, that's it. You're fired. [Gasps] She's fired. No, that couldn't be me. It says "Adrian Monk." [Laughs] Oh! Oh. Oh- Adrian! Mom, everyone's watching. Here's your lunch. It's cut into 10 little squares, just the way we like it. And your first aid kit. And your toiletry bag. Mom- You'll thank me later. Remember, don't share your food with anyone. Sit near the fire doors. I'll pick you up at 3:04. I'll be wearing an orange blouse. Mom, I know what you look like. I'll be fine. I love you, Mom. What are you doing? Right, sorry. Here he comes. He's like the real-life Eddie Munster. He can hear you. He won't even know what it means. I heard they don't even have a TV. I heard his brother never comes out of the house. I heard they have to memorize the dictionary, one letter per month. I heard that they take four showers a day. [Bell Rings] [Softly] Excuse me. Oh. Hi, Sherry. I, uh, wanted to thank you for recommending that rock-and-roll record. It was very... groovy. I didn't recommend anything. Yes, you did. You were wearing a Led Zeppelin T-shirt yesterday, which is the same thing as recommending them. [Clears Throat] So, uh, I went out, and I bought their record. The, uh, "Stairway Up To Heaven"? What did you think? Well, you know, I haven't actually listened to it yet. We don't have a record player. I assume it's excellent. I mean, uh, groovy. Yes, you can tell from the cover. They look so... groovy. Well, I gotta go. You always turn your lock back to zero. I noticed that. I do that too. So later it's easier to open. Uh-huh. Actually, there are a lot of things we have in common. "Things Adrian Monk and SherryJudd have in common." You made a list? "One, our lockers are right next to each other. Two, we both like The Patty Duke Show." Even though she has to be lying, because they're supposed to be identical cousins, which is biologically impossible. "Three, perfect attendance records." And, uh, four- [Exhales] "Neither of us has a date to the Spring Fling." How do you know that? I happened to catch a glimpse of your weekly planner, and I noticed that you have a babysitting job lined up for that evening. Unless I'm wrong, which, you know, I'm not. Hey, Sher. Hey, Jimmy. Hey, I'm goin' to art class. You wanna be my model? Yeah. Cool. Good-bye, Adrian. Bye. Yes, I will help you. What was he like as a kid? Uh, pretty much the same. Careful. Smart. Sad. L- I don't think people change really. At least, I've never seen it. I waited 10 years for my husband to change. Mr. Monk? Mr. Monk? Mr. Monk. Let's- Let's come over here. Strange. Fingerprints but no palm prints. There were two of them. Housekeeper surprised them. There was a struggle. She pushes the alarm, she hits her head and falls here. This painting- Is it valuable? Not really, except to me. It's my great-grandmother. Why would someone do something like that? Did you have spray paint in the house? No. So they must've brought it with them. Thank you. This is the housekeeper's blood. So, they defaced the painting after they killed her, after the alarm sounded. They risked everything, they risked life in prison... to deface your great-grandmother? I think that's why they were here- to do this. To draw glasses and a mustache? And a little goatee. She was your great-grandmother? Tell me about her. Well, I never met her. She was a famous suffragette. Went to jail for the right to vote. Maybe they were making a statement. You know, like a political thing. You mean, they broke into the house, and they beat a woman to death, then defaced the painting because they had trouble with the 19th Amendment? Yes. I mean, no. It's a mystery. Okay. It's my house. Sherry. Michael? How did- How did you get in? It's still my house, Sherry. At least, uh, technically. That is not true. You can't just come over, Michael. It's- It's in the agreement. It was on the news. I had to come! I'm sorry about Gladys. L- l- I really am. Are you okay? Were you here? I was in San Diego, visiting my sister. Ah, that's right. I knew that. Um, Captain Stottlemeyer, this is my ex-husband, Michael Norfleet. Yes. We've already spoken to Mr. Norfleet. Adrian Monk and Natalie Teeger. Monk? From junior high? That's right. Sherry told me all about you. About how you never took a single gym class. I had a note. [Chuckles] Oh, my God.! They did that too? Animals. Did- Did they take anything? Michael, please, just leave. Sir, she asked you to leave. Yes, okay, I'm going. But before I do- Figured I'd save myself a stamp. Here ya go. Your monthly pound of flesh. Mail it next time. I'll pay for the stamp. Yeah, well, good luck on this. See ya around. Thank you. How much do we have? [Coins Rattling] $18.25. [Chuckles] How do you do that? I don't know. [Chuckles] It's kind of funny raising money for a dance... that neither of us is going to. Uh, Leo, here's the thing- You gotta pay for that. Mmm. Pay for what? Where's your evidence, Columbo? Leo, I'm telling Principal Thicket. I'm not kidding. You don't wanna do that, Sherry. You'll be sorry. I mean it. Are you gonna pay us or not? Hmm. [Gasps] [Laughing] Leo, I'm telling. I'm serious. Here. It's okay. It's only chocolate. Here. Thanks. You should carry these with you. Now, that's a list of people that have worked at her house over the past year. Do you recognize anybody? No. Neither do we. Monk, Natalie and Sherry are downstairs waitin' for ya. Oh, yeah. They're taking the painting to the museum. A guy named James Duffy works there as a restoration expert. What, you're going with? Yeah. Well, keep your eyes open. What? What do you mean? It's just that your friend SherryJudd... just got a homeowner's policy worth a million dollars two weeks ago. That's pretty convenient, isn't it? Well, that's ridiculous. Y-You think she did it herself for the insurance? No, no. She was in San Diego like she said, but she could've hired somebody. No! No? Well, she doesn't need the money. I got a look at that alimony check. She's getting 20 grand a month. That's a lot of dough. Thank you. But, Monk, you and I have put enough rich people in jail to know that a lot of dough is never enough. They always want more. Not Sherry. You don't know her. What? It's just that I haven't heard you talk about a woman like this... for a long time. [Sherry] How did you get all that chocolate out? My mom makes me keep a backup shirt in my locker. [Exhales] Listen, Sherry. [Clears Throat] I, uh- I really like you- Hey, Judd. Here. Let me help. What are you doing? Mr. Thicket said I have to act more like a gentleman. He said that just before he gave me two weeks' detention. Thanks for ratting me out. Well, you know, Leo, you were stealing from the decorating committee. Man. Which means that you were really stealing from everybody. Relax, Charlie Brown. I learned a lesson. I'll never steal again. For example, I'll never do this. Uh, hey, Leo, that's mine. Would you please give it back? And I would never, ever dip this into the toilet. Please, not the toilet. Not the toilet. Come on, Leo. Be cool, man. This is none of your business, Jimmy. I'm just sayin' there's already enough bad vibes in the world. We don't have to add to it. Come on. Give it back. What would MickJagger do? He'd give it back, wouldn't he? Here. This isn't over. So, what's the name of that dance? The Spring Fling. It sounds stupid, but if you wanna go, I'll go. Yeah. That'd be cool. [Bell Rings] Are you okay? Oh, I'm fine. Are you sure? Because I could get Natalie to carry it. Hello. We have an appointment with, um, James Duffy, Art Restoration? Sure. He'll meet you in the main gallery. Thank you. Mr. Monk. Mr. Monk, can I give you some advice? Yeah. And I'm only saying this to you as a friend. As someone who's dated. A lot. What? Some wine spilled. Where? Over there. It's a painting. It's driving me a little crazy. Then don't look at it. Okay, it's about Sherry. I've been watching you, and l- I can't not look. Maybe they could fix it. This guy we're seeing restores art, right? Mr. Monk- Maybe he could just paint over it. - Turn that a little- - Forget about the painting! I think you should ask her out. Take her to dinner. Sherry? No. No, I can't. Yes, you can. I know you want to. I do? Yes, you want to. Trust me on this. What about Trudy? I'm a married man. Oh, Mr. Monk, it's... not really a date. You're old friends, right? You're just catching up. Mr. Monk, she likes you. No. There's no way. Why not? She knows me. Just think about this for one second. There are over 200 private detectives in this city. But she came to you, didn't she? She likes you. I'm not gonna ask you again, Miss Judd. I want you to open that locker. This is crazy! Principal Thicket, I didn't take anything. Open the locker. - What's going on? - Somebody stole the bake sale money. Mr. Thicket got an anonymous note. Whoever wrote it said they saw the money in Sherry's locker. That's impossible. [Murmuring] L-That's not mine. That's not mine. How did that get in there? Where's the money, Sherry? I don't know. I swear. I didn't take it. Well, how did this get in there? Does anyone else know your combination? No. Let's go. To my office. I think we need to talk to your parents. Back to class. Everybody, back to class! I love this one. Look at their faces. I wonder what they're thinking. She's planning to murder him. What? She's about to feed him amanita mushrooms. You can tell by the little white spots. It's a deadly poison. Well, maybe she doesn't know. Oh, she knows. He's been hitting her. She's swollen. See the bruises on her arms and her left eye? She knows what she's doing. Must be hard... to be you, to see everything. It's awful. [Mouths Words] Sherry- Mm-hmm? I was wondering- Later, uh, when we're done here, if you're not too busy, maybe, um, we could- You know- Hello. James Duffy. Hi. My assistant, uh, told me you have a canvas... that you need me to- Sherry? Yes? [Chuckles] It's Jimmy Wagner. Jimmy? Yeah. Oh, my God! I don't believe this. Adrian, can you believe it? It's Jimmy Wagner! You still wear a flower in your hair. You look great. Oh, no, you look great. You look great. They both look great. Oh. Oh, do you remember Adrian Monk? Yes, of course, Adrian. Supersleuth. I read about you all the time. Jimmy! Yeah. Oh, and Natalie Teeger. They're, uh- Hi. They're helping me out. I've just had a terrible week. Somebody broke into my house, my housekeeper was killed. I heard about that. I am so sorry. - I didn't realize that was you. - Oh, well, it's confusing. Sometimes I'm Sherry Norfleet. I was divorced in April. Oh. Well, how about you? Divorced. You know, a lot of that goin' around. Oh, and you changed your name? My mother remarried when I was 15. Oh! You- You really look great. So, I guess I should take a look at the patient? Oh. It's over here. Oh. You've come a long way from tie-dyeing T-shirts. Oh, I still do that on the weekends too. Don't tell anybody. I remember this painting. It was in your parents' dining room. - Yeah, that's right. - Excuse me, Jimmy. Jim. Jim. Uh, is there anything peculiar about that spray paint? Uh, I'll have to run some tests. But it feels like an oil-based spray enamel. You can get it at any hardware store. So, uh, what do you think, Doc? Is she gonna make it? She'll be fine. I'll take good care of her. Sherry, are you busy? Yeah, I would- I would love to show you my studio. It's just around the corner. L- I'd love that. [Laughs] That sounds like fun. You look great. ## [Slow Rock] Sherry was here. Cash box was here. Leo comes in. "Put that cupcake down." [Girl Laughing] ## [Man Singing] Adrian Monk, is that you? [Exhales] You're not allowed in here until after the dance. Oh, I'm not here for the dance. I'm trying to figure out who stole the money from the bake sale. They said it was that girl. The honor student, SherryJudd. Oh. I made these for the after-party. Here. Tell me what ya think. [Groans] Here. Here, take this one. It has 10 chocolate chips. Exactly 10.Just the way you like it. You're an excellent cook, Mrs. Ledskey. It's a gift and a curse. Here, I'll send some more of these home with you. For you and your brother. I've got some boxes left over from the bake sale. Blue icing. What is it? It's a clue. Oh. I'm so sorry, Mr. Monk. No. I'm happy for her. They seem like a great couple. Well, they're not a couple yet. They will be. She's gonna go out with him. How do you know? Oh, I noticed little things. Like the way she said, "Yes, I will go out with you," as she wrote her phone number on his hand... and didn't let go of his hand for 27 seconds. [Motorcycle Starts] Natalie. Look at his gloves. - Yeah, so? - No fingers. You remember the handprint on Sherry's wall? They were bikers? They were bikers. Captain. You know that list of all the people... who worked at SherryJudd's house in the last year? Yeah. Cross-checked it against registered motorcycle owners. We got two hits. Well, good. Let's take one, give one to Monk. Yes, sir, which one? Doesn't matter. Oh. Just pick one. One potato, two potato, three potato, four. Five potato, six potato, seven potato, more. Randy. A woman is dead. Yes, sir. My mother told me to pick the- ## [Jukebox: Rock] Hey. [Whistles] You okay? You look uncomfortable. Why don't we leave? No, Mr. Monk. I'm fine. Okay. But, uh, if you get uncomfortable, you let me know, and we just leave. Okay. But w-w-wait. Or if you feel like you're about to get uncomfortable- Mr. Monk, why don't we call the captain? Just let him handle this. No. No, no. We can do this. Who are you trying to impress? Nobody. Sherry. No. Natalie, I'm a private detective. This is what I do. I don't care what SherryJudd thinks of me. She's just a girl who sat behind me in homeroom. Hey. You alone? No. I'm with him. So you're alone. You know what, buddy? You don't wanna do this. Just... back off. [Chuckles] [Chuckles] Hey. How ya doin'? We're lookin' for Travis and George Baptiste. Never heard of'em. Okay, let's go. That's funny. 'Cause we heard they're in here all the time. [Coughs] [Coughing] Waiter, he's- He's- Excuse me. Sir, there's no smoking. It's okay. He can smoke. [Coughs] [Coughing] New rule. No spazzes in the bathroom. Okay, if I see any spazzes, I'll tell them. You're a regular Flip Wilson, ya know that? Where's the money, Leo? What are you talkin' about, Monk? Monk the punk? [Chuckles] You took the money from the bake sale. You put it in a cake box so nobody would see you leaving with it. Hey. They found the empty cash box, remember? It was in your girlfriend's locker. Which was locked. - You framed her. - How? Tell me. She's the only one who knows the combination. I don't know how, but you did it. - You're the guy. - I'm the guy. I'm the guy who's about to stuff you in your own locker and lock the door. [Clears Throat] You, uh, lookin' for us? Travis Baptiste? Yeah, I'm Travis. This is George. Your neighbors said we might find you here. You guys did some roofing work for Michael Norfleet last year? Yeah, that's right. I wonder why you're asking. I wonder if you wonder. Where were you Sunday night, Travis? - You a cop? - Are you... the killer? Whoa, whoa. [Crowd Murmuring] [Man] Hit him.! - Damn it! - Time out. Time out. Let me get that. - Mr. Monk, get back.! - Broken glass. Get back.! Get back.! Get down. Get down. [Siren Wailing] [Man] Guys, guys, guys.! It's the cops. [Man #2] Come on.! Let's go.! Drop it! Everyone on the floor now! Officer. Officer. Officer, I'm Adrian Monk. I want you to put out an A.P. B... on two homicide suspects thatjust ran outta here. Names are Travis Baptiste and his brother George. Got it? Yeah. Mr. Monk, look. He left his wallet. 109 Vinton Street. That's Sherry's house. Enter here. Somebody must've hired them. What? Why are you making that face? Why are you smiling? Stop it! [Children Gasp] Kid, you all right? Huh? Adrian, are you okay? He'll be scarred for life, psychologically. Nah, he'll get over it. What did he say? He said he solved the case. He knows how Leo did it. Mike Norfleet. Captain Stottlemeyer wants to see me. [Chuckles] Yeah, I know. I gotta go. Whatever it is, I didn't do it. Sherry? Captain? What's going on? Oh, good! Ah, you fixed it. It's as good as new. Sir, sir. Please don't touch that. That's evidence. W- Evidence of what? Mr. Norfleet, you're under arrest for the murder of Gladys Aquino, your wife's housekeeper. Son, this'll be a lot easier on everyone if you just confess. I know you took the money. That's crazy. It was in her locker. Nobody else could've opened it. The cash box was in her locker because you put it there. And I know how you did it. Here's what happened. You hired two men, Travis Baptiste and his brother, to break in to Sherry's house. - Ridiculous. - We found this in Travis's wallet. Anyone could've written that. It's true. The letters are printed. There's nothing special about them. But look at the house number. Look at the zero. There's a little line through it. I noticed something yesterday... when you were stuffing me into my locker, which, by the way, wasn't very cool. My lock was set to zero. I remembered that Sherry always set her lock to zero as well. But the day before, when Principal Thicket found the cash box, her lock was not set to zero. This was all about the zeros. You don't see a zero written like this very often, but I saw four of them. The day before, when you were writing Sherry's alimony check. I've seen other people write zeros like that. True, but how many of them also know the floor plan to your wife's house? Here's what happened. When you pretended to help her with her books, you pocketed her lock and replaced it with yours. It was a perfect plan. You took out the money. Then, when nobody was watching, you came back and planted the cash box. Then you put her lock back on the locker. Why would I hire somebody to break into her house? - There's nothing in there that I want. - [Monk] Ah, yes. The motive. I knew it had something to do with this painting, but I just couldn't figure out what. Then, I remembered how you resented paying all that alimony. I believe you called it "your monthly pound of flesh." Her alimony? You'd be paying her alimony forever, unless she got remarried. This wasn't about stealing anything, or hurting anybody. This was about them. You were fixing them up. He knew aboutJimmy. I talked about him all the time. You tracked him down. And you got lucky. He was single and still living right here in the city. [Monk] But you had a problem. How were you gonna get them together? You couldn't just call her. You and Sherry were barely speaking. And she would have resented any suggestion you made. So you played Cupid. You hired Travis and his brother... to break in to her house and to deface the painting, a painting she loved- one you knew she would want restored. You were betting that eventually she'd bring it toJames. He is the best art restorer in the city. They would discover that they still had feelings for each other. And you were right. Nice story. You can't prove any of it. You can't prove any of this! Are you gonna believe Adrian Monk? He's a freak. Ask anybody. Let's empty out all your pockets. Come on. That's my money. Travis and George werejust picked up this morning in Las Vegas. They will be here tomorrow. And these boys are gonna talk. I could promise you that. Their fingerprints were all over that room. This money's from the bake sale. That's my handwriting. I wrote "good luck"... next to "Honest Abe" Lincoln. Why don't you and I have a little talk in my office? I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Nobody was supposed to get hurt. What was Gladys doing there? It was supposed to be her day off. Lieutenant Disher, book him. The crazy thing is, it worked. Congratulations, darling. Thank you. You're amazing. You're still amazing. Adrian. Bye. Repair and Synchronization by Easy Subtitles Synchronizer 1.0.0.0
