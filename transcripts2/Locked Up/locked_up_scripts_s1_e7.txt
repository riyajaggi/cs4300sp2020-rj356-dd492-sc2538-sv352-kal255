 Stop! Civil Guard. Don't move. Turn around. Put the gun down. Hands on your head. Please don't shoot. I'm pregnant. 10 DAYS LATER The weight is fine, so is the size. It's a normal ten week embryo. I'm so happy that you've changed your mind.

 Hey, Blondie. You ate Yolanda's card and they're looking for it, right? Where are you going? The Governor's waiting. My head hurts. I've got a migraine, Doctor. - Can I get some aspirin? - Once I finish this. It's like a prawn. - What do you mean? - It's not ugly, it just doesn't look too great right now. - Do you want to know the sex? - Can you tell already? I'd say it's a boy. I'd hedge my bets on it being a boy. Look, you can see his little dick. - You're right, it's a boy. - That's amazing. Quiet now, let's listen to the heartbeat. Fuck,

 the kid's really going for it. You survived a shootout kid. You're a strong man. Like your mum. Put the gun down. What happened? Where are the others? Where is Inspector Castillo? Four, two. How are you, darling? They wouldn't let us see you. - Where's Mum? - She's in Viveiro with her sisters. She was very upset, but you know she feels happier there. Dad, I'm pretty sure they'll be listening to this. And recording it too. I was at the shootout in the woods, just like the police told you. I found something. I found it by accident. Then they took me for identification. Maca, how are you? I'm good. Really good. It was... it was awful. But all of a sudden, it was like someone shook me. And it was all a dream. I woke up. You look tired, Dad. You need to sleep. You shouldn't worry about me because I'm fine. You have to believe me, really. Now I just want... I want to wait for the trial. I want to defend myself. I don't want to do anything else crazy. I don't want you to, either. Do you understand? Dad, do you understand? Things were looking pretty hopeless. Now it's different. Don't worry, darling. We're seeing the lawyer later to see if he can speed things up. Maca, how's your health? Have you had any problems? No. I'm really good, Román. Really good. Now I want you to request another visit and bring Mum. I have something important to tell you all. OK. I love you all so much. Does prison change your life? It does. Of course it does. It doesn't really change the way you think. It was something else that changed me. The gunshots. Being there and not knowing whether they were dead or alive. When you see... death so near, you see life differently. Without fear. Two weeks have passed since the shootout at Sierra de Ayllón. As you can see, the investigation is ongoing. Nice one, Zule. You'll be famous after all. Hanbal Hamadi, aka the Egyptian. Hey, Chacha. He's just a kid. Sh! Is he your boyfriend or your nephew? I'd love a toy boy. What are you doing, you Muslim bitch? These are some of the crimes that police have been investigating for four years. They won't get him. As we were explaining, the investigation is ongoing. The ticket out. Linchún. Linchún. Linchún! Macarena, Macarena. Go and check on them. - He's dead. - Fuck. - Fabio's hurt. - Check if there's an exit wound. Yes, there's one. That's good, right? It's good, because he can be saved with some stitches. But it's bad, because if they don't pick us up in twenty minutes, he'll bleed to death. - You've reached Emergency. - Inspector Castillo, Chief of Police's office. There's been a shootout. One dead and two injured. What's your location? Where am I? How the fuck should I know? - Fancy a book, darling? - No. Oh, you can't read. - A book or whisky? - A whisky. Hello, boss. Here you are. Hi, Sole. Why are you reading so many books? You can't learn how to give birth from books. - Really? - No. Women in the jungle stand up, hold onto a trunk and get ready to shit. Sole, I'm not having my baby while hugging a tree. Sole, she doesn't realise that having a baby... - is like shitting a melon. - Sure. It seems almost impossible, but trust me, it comes out eventually. - You're right. - Seriously, - you're making me dread it. - No. Have you told your mum? Here's what you asked for. Pregnancy and labour. Sole. It's a boy. A baby boy. A beautiful baby boy. You look happy, Blondie. Anything we should know? Or is it just the pregnancy hormones? You should try it. Maybe you'll lose that frigid face. Yes. I'm happy. Really happy about my son. And because... I don't want to leave here, at just any cost. Not right now. Sure. It's fucking great here. I suppose you won't mind that I have the money. Macarena's experiencing something much more important - than 9 million euros? - Says who? A homeless woman? You know what? I hope your boyfriend has found the money. I hope he's got it. If that means you leave here. That'd be a bonus, for all of us. Careful with the blonde one, she was firing shots in the woods. - Really? - Silence. Who've you been shooting? No one. It went off by itself. That kid'll know how to say whore before it can say mummy. Enjoy your baby, surrounded by murderers. Bitch. May God hear me and keep her pussy dry. And itchy. Did you know there's a cell block for mothers? You should request a transfer. Block 2 is no good for you or the baby. The judge is about to end the search. As we told you earlier, the 9 million euros is presumed to be in the hands of Hanbal Hamadi, the Egyptian. What the fuck do we do if he's taken it? He hasn't taken anything because he doesn't know where it is. The police think he has it. They found the hole we made, and it wasn't there. OK. When they leave, we'll go back with spades. We can't go back, the police are there. - Did you not hear your sister? - Yes. And I didn't recognise her. She was like a robot, talking about them recording us. She was like that because she's in the middle of an investigation. - Or because they're pressuring her. - Román, she's right. This is a dangerous situation, and we have to get out of it soon. - What are you talking about? - We'll talk to the lawyer later. We'll see if he can speed things up. It's not enough. Your sister was in a shootout. What do you want? For them to kill us? This family is crazy. We can't sleep. Your mum leaves, comes back for two days and leaves again. There's no God in this house. Don't you think that's enough? Hello. Who's speaking? Who's speaking? Why didn't you say you were coming? I would have picked you up. I just spoke to my cousin Paca, the one from Badajoz. - She told me the news. - What news? You're getting married, Gypsy. I told her there's no chance. Since when are you getting married? Since when, Antonia? Since my first period. Since I was 14, since my dad told me I would, and now I am. How can you get married? You have to suck dick to get married. And you've been eating pussy your whole life. Honey, he must be absolutely tiny... because you're not going to know what to do with it! If it's any good send him to me. You're getting married? How? Why? Tell me. Because they're a good family and they have a lot of money. And I don't want my family to suffer. You don't understand. - I don't understand? - No. Do you know where I come from? They tried to make me get married too. To someone old and revolting with two wives. - What did you do? - I ran away, I was just a kid. Then I fell in love with someone. Do you understand? You can be whoever you want to be. You're a lesbian, so tell your parents. Nobody can change who you are. Not you. Never. Never. The assessment board have met. They're prepared to award you third grade. Yes. Fuck. I'll see the sun without any fences in the way. Fuck, I'll have a fucking beer without going to solitary. If you get it, you'll go to a special semi-release block. You can only leave during working hours. OK. Do you understand what that means, Estefanía? - What? - You have to find a job. Anything. It doesn't matter what. But if not, you can't enjoy third grade. Sons of bitches! Fuck! You've tricked me, bony. So they're not going to let me leave. Just another fucking lie. Are you here to talk to the Governor? Yes. We just need to see a job offer in your name. It's procedure. How do I get a job to leave if I can't leave? Explain that. Fuck. You lied to me, man. Wait here if you want. Now that Fabio isn't here, I'm assisting management. Congratulations on your baby. Thank you. They told me what happened in the woods. That your gun went off. Don't worry, it happened to me on my first day. Embarrassing. No worries. To be honest, you could have ran away. Why didn't you? You won't run, right? I'm not a silly bitch. I guess, right? Estefanía, calm down. Calm down. I'll be at your side. I'll help you. There's a social worker who'll help you out. Look, Governor. I've never had a job. I've never even had the chance, OK? I've got no chance now. Thank you. They don't give a shit. - Listen, keep it up and... - What? You'll end up in solitary instead of outside. May I remind you that this release is a gift. And you haven't earned it all on your own. Don't you think betraying my best friend is "all on my own"? Ferreiro. You're up. - Good morning. - Hello. I imagine you already know, but I wanted to tell you I'm pregnant. Happily pregnant? Yes, very. Thank goodness. Great. Take a seat, please. I'm delighted, Macarena. This well help you a lot. - In life, but particularly in here. - Yes. I want to know if there's any chance of a transfer. I've been told there's a maternity block. No. That block is for women who have given birth. But... Let's see. Listen. What I can do... is I can put you on laundry duty. You'll do fine there. Right. But is there no chance of a quicker transfer? No. It's just that after the woods, the shootout and everything, honestly... It's been tough on us all. Honestly, I fear for my baby. I don't want him to get ill. Have you talked to Sandoval? I just... I thought that, being a woman, you'd understand better. Of course. - Yes. - We'll see what we can do. For now, we'll fill out the forms and I'll talk to you in a few days. - Thank you. Thank you very much. - Fill out the form. You were very brave in the woods. He's bleeding a lot. How long will they be? 20 minutes, 50? What the fuck do I know? Fabio, listen to me. You need to get out. If you lean on Macarena you can reach the road. I'm fine. I'm blocking the wound. Is that right? Get the fuck out of here. Do you hear me? Come here, kid. You won't run, right? I'm not a silly bitch. Can I trust you? What the fuck are you whispering about? Where are you going? What the fuck are you looking for? This baby's mine. And no one else's. There's someone in here now. He'll be a tiny person. He'll depend on me. I don't know. It feels like he was put there for a reason. I no longer feel lost. I do think about leaving here. Now I want it, but not just at any price. I only have one fear. That something happens to him. How do I look? Like a Moorish Queen. Seriously. What's wrong? I haven't seen Hanbal in four years. It was like a fairy tale. He was nineteen. I was 30. We had so much sex. And now I'm 40. It's not such a fairy tale anymore. - Has he called you yet? - No. Well, Zule, he took a big risk at the shootout. He has to stay hidden. He can look after himself, right? Come on, Zule. He's mad about you. For the person you are. If not, why would he be searching high and low for the money, to get you out of here. What's wrong is that now he's 28 with 9 million euros. Look at this shit. Covered in hair and toothpaste. You haven't cleaned anything, you pig. Clean it with your tongue. Lick. Lick. That's right, with your tongue. You think you're of use to me? You think what you earn has any use? It doesn't. I only do it so you'll react. React. React. Aren't you going to react? Shit! Zule. Zule. Relax. He'll call you. I've hired lots of waitresses. How do you serve drinks? - I'm better at drinking them. - Well, you can learn. Maca, she's not a waitress. She's a whore. You'd have to pay me a lot for that, darling. Look at the black princess. Locked up and fucked. But she still has her dignity. Keep looking. The offers will flood in. Listen, calm the fuck down or you'll be eating that polish, OK? Do you speak any languages, Curly? Yes, mine. And God speaks it perfectly. You must have some experience. You'll have to write a CV. Well, let's see. I can drive any car without a licence. Stolen or not. I can also jump, tune and burn them, if needed. There's my fucking CV. Great CV. You'll get any job you want. Hey. Maybe I can help. My uncle could sort out a job for you. He manages the motorway tolls. I worked there one summer. It's an awful job. You spend all day in a booth saying: "Three-fifty, please." All day. - It's a shit job. - What are you talking about? - It's shit! - Really? Three-fifty. Three-fifty. You meet lots of people. "Three-fifty, baby. I finish at 3, come get me." A whore since the day she was born. Thanks, babe. If I have to give your uncle a blowjob, I will. OK? No. My uncle is married, with children. My uncle has no interest in your blowjobs. But if you do, he might make you his secretary. - I'll do it. - What? Curly, no. Please. If he can get me a job, I'll suck his dick too. - Curly, listen. - Cock sucker. My God, that's awful. You're so amazing. You're so amazing that when I'm in third grade, my life will be shit because you won't be around. - Kabila. - My God. Why are you interrupting something so personal? Ask first. The Chief Jailer is looking for you... to get the uniforms ready for the new prisoners. At your service, for now. Go on. Let them know who you are, Kabila. Kabila! Kabila! I was visiting my sisters, Aunty Eugenia and Anselmo. Everyone wants to help. There's nearly 120,000 euros. Your brother said he'd make a transfer today or tomorrow. You told my brother? What's wrong? Are you worried about what they'll say? No. That has nothing to do with it. Your brother's loaded and he offered. My brother is middle management at the motorway concession. He's not a multi-millionaire. Where did they get all this money from? Under the mattress? How should I know? People save what they can. Do you think helping us is more important to them, than saving for their kids' education? They spend their whole lives saving. People want to help, just as you would for them. We're going to Viveiro now to take it all back. What will you pay bail with, Dad? What with, Dad? If we're not going for the money in the woods? Hello. Who's this? - My darling. - That's enough, Mum. Madam. Enough. See? Can a mother not kiss her daughter? Yes, but not in front of everyone here. Are you eating well, Saray? Are you OK? I'm fine. And yourselves? How are you all? It's been a while since you came to see me. Has something happened? The head of the clan wants us out. There was a problem at the market. He says he wants us out in two weeks. And there's only one way to fix it, Saray. - How, Dad? - You get married, Saray. - You marry his son, now. - Saray. We're beating about the bush. - You know the wedding was discussed. - We arranged it when you were a girl. Once we apply for an appeal, in three or four weeks you'll be transferred to the court for a hearing. Great. Do it. Zulema, I've heard nothing from your boyfriend. He's not going to head out looking for a signal to call you. Are you sure? Have you thought about it? Jesus Christ. Are you really going to charge this crazy amount that you're asking for? Because sometimes I wonder, why am I paying this idiot? Why am I paying this idiot when I'm doing all the work? I bet your wife gets sick at the idea of fucking you. Have you thought about that? We'll request the appeal. Good. When they call me to court, everything will be done. It's no secret that you've got months left until you leave. He says he doesn't care. You can get married in here. Dad, I don't want to get married in prison. In here or out there, what's the difference? We can request a transfer to Badajoz. Then you'll be closer to one another. - I can't. - Didn't you hear your father? They're kicking us out. We'll be out on the street. Mum, I can't. You'll marry whomever and whenever your father says. Just like your mother and grandmother. That's the way it is. How's it going? - What's going on? - Who's this gorgio? Not a gorgio, or a gypsy, or a Muslim, or a Christian. Here, we are all women. Our own women. Can you leave? No, I'm not leaving. - I'm not leaving. - Go. Please. I wish someone had done this for me before. Pardon me, but Saray can't get married. She's a lesbian. A lesbian. An adult. Free to live her own life. Got it? Come on, clear off. Let's go. Is that true, Saray? You're a lesbian? Yes. What difference does it make? Mum, what difference does it make? Mum. Look at me. - What? - Goodbye, Saray. What do you mean? Mum. Mum. Fuck. - Not going to the yard? - No. I'm waiting for Curly. Have you got a thing for her? - What do you mean? - You know! She's my friend. I like her a lot, but that's it. Well, Maca, here in prison... there's a fine line between having a friend and getting laid. A fine line that gets broken. It's perfectly fine. You haven't been the same since the woods. You're changing, Maca. For the better. Let's get some sun in the yard. Up you get, Blondie. Come on. OK. Suit yourself, Snow White. Are you crazy? What the fuck are you doing? I'm not leaving. What? I'm not leaving you in the middle of the woods with the crazy Muslim and his gun. The Egyptian's gun was a Glock, wasn't it? I think so. A Glock 37. Then he's emptied the magazine. He's out of bullets. Get the fuck out of here. You're assuming he hasn't reloaded. You could pass out, anything could happen. And they'll never find you, dickhead. - I'm staying. - Fabio. Let's go to the road and ask for help, please. Don't be a stubborn fuck. Your lady can't see and you're to blame. For your fucking decisions. - Now you'll leave her widowed. - Will you shut the fuck up? I'll shut up whenever I want. You have to leave, got it? You son of a bitch. Shut up, both of you. Shut up! You're going to lose blood. Block the exit wound too. How do I do that? Stick your little finger in. Real hard. Until he groans. Ready. Ready. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Relax, relax. Relax, relax. It's Carolina. Hello. Hi, it's Maca. How are you? Tell him I don't mind taking plenty of hours. Great, great. Listen, I don't have much time. Tell him about the blowjob. I'm calling to ask you for a favour. It's for a friend who... Well, she needs a job. Yes. A friend from in here. She needs a job to get to third grade. I was thinking maybe you could put her on one of the toll roads. Yes. A girl from in here, yes. No... Uncle... No, she stole a car. But... It was a long time ago. She's finished with all that now. You can trust her, look... OK. Great. Thank you very much. See you later, bye. My uncle says he wants to give you the job, but you have to have an interview. It's company policy. OK? All right then. Great. Fabio. Hello? Fabio, can you hear me? Yes, darling. Listen, I can't talk now. I'll call you when I can. OK. Sorry, I love you. Love you too. Can't you tell her the fucking truth for once? What the fuck do you want me to tell her, dickhead? That I'm bleeding to death from a bullet wound? Relax. You promised her you wouldn't get involved in this shit ever again. You owe it to her. You owe it to her to go home. I also promised her I would love her forever. And I don't anymore. But you're right, I owe it to her. Help me. Wait, wait. Grab this. Fabio! Fabio! Fabio. Fabio, no! Fabio! Get help at the road. Run. Run. Hurry. If you don't hurry he'll die. Run. Please, give a round of applause for a colleague. One who's shown that we're a family at Cruz del Sur. Where we don't just have some of the finest professionals. We have heroes too. - How's the wound patch? - Stuck on strong. - I'm going to... - Be strong. Fabio, don't be stupid. I miss you. Me too. The nurses are worse than the prisoners. Whatever. - Hello, Carolina. - Hello, how are you? Fabio. You had us all worried sick. - Is this your wife? - Yes. Carolina, this is Miranda. - Hello. - A pleasure. Likewise. Darling, the taxi's outside. Fabio, I'm very proud of you. Very proud. I love you. I love you too. Come on, for Christ's sake. Fuck. Mum, don't go. Don't hang up. For God's sake, let me speak for a second. What do you want? For me to get married? I'll get married. Yes, whenever you like. Tomorrow, if you want. OK. OK. And Mum... Everyone, that's all. Back to work. Fabio. Welcome back. Come on, back to work. I'm sick of doing both our jobs. Shameless. - How is she? - Who? Macarena. - Ferreiro, how is she? - Good. She's happy about the baby and integrating better every day. - If you know what I mean. - Integrating better? Do I have to spell it out? She spends all day with Curly. One, one. I thought she was straight, but here you never know whether they like pork, fish... or whatever the fuck they like. Keep still. Fucking hell. The number you are calling is switched off or out of range.
