 What's up, darling? Yes, he's here with me. Palacios! - My wife wants to talk to you. - Me? Yes. Hello? Yes, it's me. Of course, sure. I'll be there. OK, thank you. See you. - She invited me for dinner tonight. - She's wanted to do that for a while. Let the one among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone.

 Go in peace and jump the wire fence. Will you stop? And stop playing that fucking piano! - What should I bring? A bottle of wine? - That's fine. No, champagne. Champagne is classier. Champagne? Do you think my wife is Princess Letizia? She's the Queen. And I don't know. We've worked together for over a year, I know nothing about her. - Or why the fuck she's invited me. - Fabio. It's me, Paloma. Go ahead. Find Palacios, and go to the Warden's. It's urgent. - What about these guys? - Valbuena is heading to the chapel. OK, we're on our way. WE WON'T FORGET YOU, YOLANDA

 - What are you doing, bitch? Share it! - It's delicious. What the fuck are you doing? It's the Body of Christ, not a snack. Sole, chill out. They're not consecrated yet! Come on, you think you own them? I haven't seen one of these in ages! Hey, Sole! Give it to me, come on. Give it to me! Drinking alone brings bad luck. Yeah, right! And you're drinking it all! Give it to me. - The Blood of Christ. - I want some! - Excuse me. - Yes? Can I work in the greenhouse? No, no way. Take time off sick. - What's the problem? - I'm allergic to polyester. - And this is polyester underwear. - You should've warned us. We won't make you wear something that hurts you. Come in. Pull your trousers down. And your pants, too. Ferreiro, I'm your doctor. Let's see... My mother's a nurse, and she gives me cortisone. For the rash... That'll do. I'll prescribe you a corticosteroid cream. Thank you. Just smiling and saying thank you is useless here. I'll tell you how you can thank me. What do you mean? Can you sew? Sandoval, Sandoval! She isn't breathing. It's a cardiac arrest. Put her over there! I need space. Checking! Have adrenaline ready. - Defibrillators! Clear! - Ready. - Clear! - Ready. Again. Clear! Yes! That's it! Well done. Well done, Sole. Thanks, Miranda. You should have told us about your birthday. - We would've brought you a present. - Bullshit! You've been planning a surprise party for three days. - No, thank you. Happy birthday. - Thanks, Paloma. OK, I'm lying. But I'm upset because someone's given it away. Nobody has, Palacios. I just watched 11 hours of CCTV with the police. I summoned you because the police believe that Yolanda's murderer must have had an officer as an accomplice. The three of you were on duty that night. That means one of you is an accessory to murder. A threat... a bribe, or perhaps someone just crossed the line. What actually happened? Well, right now it seems that we are all... innocent until proven guilty. Don't you agree, Warden? Of course. You have been summoned to testify before Inspector Castillo tomorrow. We'll have to wait and see. A judge will clarify this. We'll just wait and see. Well, if you've nothing else to say, you can go back to your duties. Thank you. Authorization. - Fabio! - What's up? Maybe this is not the right time to go to your house for dinner. - Why? - Fuck, man! We're under criminal investigation. We could be accused of accessory to murder. So? How can you fucking say that? This is not the best time. - Excuse me! - Hang on, will you? You don't want to come for dinner because I could be an accessory to murder? - It sounds stupid the way you say it. - It is! Well, I don't know, Fabio. I don't know much about you. Why were you fired from the police? I said wait! I wasn't fired. I decided to quit. - Any more questions? - No. Are you coming, or shall I ask Carolina to wait until you know if I'm a murderer? I'm coming. But if it wasn't me, because I know it wasn't me, and it wasn't you either... then Paloma's switched sides. Shit. Look, it's nap time for the dangerous ones. If you wake them up, I'll stick your horn up your ass, you moron! I wouldn't stay here, move! You've suffered a cardiogenic shock. You know damn well you can't drink with your heart condition. As a precaution, you'll be moved to the 12 de Octubre Hospital. No, thanks for the trip, but I'm staying. You have no choice. I'll only leave to have my transplant surgery. But it seems that'll never happen. Am I right, Warden? You're on the waiting list. That's all we can do. Would you give me a donor's heart? The National Transplant Organization considers medical issues, not moral ones. So they'll do a transplant on a criminal sentenced to 22 years for murder. Do you really think so? Do you think that... if a donor shows up, they won't check the records, and they won't say, "Listen, Doctor, we have a criminal on the waiting list who killed her husband and his lover. She burned them with gasoline. And we also have a housewife with four children..." What do you think they'll do? Miranda? How can I regret something I didn't do? You'll always regret it. But it doesn't mean you won't do it again. I guess I deserve it. So I accept it. No problem. People think, "She took a life. You can't play God taking a life." No. Some things are worse than killing. Because they can kill you slowly. That man was killing me slowly. I didn't do anything! I defended my child! What would you have done? I don't regret it. Is that what you want me to say? I won't. I only feel guilty for my mother. Poor woman. She felt ashamed in the village because I misbehaved. - I'd do the same again. - I'd do it differently. Do the ones outside regret what they did to me? I put up with it for a long time, until it happened. Don't use it. Don't. Thanks. How's it going with my girlfriend? Sorry? Cool tattoo. "Curly love". Curly is my girl. It wasn't easy, you know. It took me a year and a half to seduce her. I watched her sleep and wake up every day. Until she finally left the girlfriend she had at the time. And when I finally made it, I was transferred to Alicante. I had to hurt myself several times so that they'd bring me back here. Look! Love won in the end. How romantic. Our love isn't over. If you leave her alone, she'll come back to me. But listen... if you don't leave her alone, I'll make sure you do. Don't worry, I will. But I think you should talk about this with her... Why are you here? You should be celebrating your birthday at home. I went home. But I came back. What about the tests? Any news? Tere's toxicology test was negative. She's clean. Why so many tests? It would be helpful if I knew why. As soon as we get a positive result, we'll know there's a new heroin shipment. And I know who has it. Do you? Who? Anabel. Why am I not surprised? May I surprise you? They belong to Tere. How's this possible? I have no idea. - I'm sorry. - No, it's OK. It was my fault. I forgot to lock the door. I'm leaving. Actually, I wanted to talk to you. Neither Palacios nor I deleted the security records. And you've just become a mother. Paloma, if you did it, don't say a word. Anyone could get into the control room and put the magnets anytime. They can't prove anything. I didn't know they were going to kill Yolanda. I swear I didn't. I thought it would be a jailbreak or something, but I never... They sneaked into my home and... and they recorded... They recorded my... my children. At nighttime, in their cribs. They've got someone outside watching me. I'm being watched, Fabio. Forget it right now. If the police ask you, you haven't seen anything. How can I forget this and look away? What kind of person would I be? You can be someone who confesses, abandoning her twins to serve a sentence, or someone who turns a blind eye and gets on with her life. Who asked you to do it? - No. - Paloma, who was it? - No. - Paloma. Zulema Zahir. In this time of grief... Yolanda should be remembered by those who were her best friends. WE WON'T FORGET YOU, YOLANDA I think about you all day, Yolanda. Every moment... Every second... Sometimes... it takes... many years... to find a lifelong friend, but... in just a few months in jail... Yolanda, you'll have a place in here forever. I will always admire you. Always. There are tons of things I wanna do when I get out: I wanna work... I think I'll take an aviation course. It's kind of crazy, but it's cool. I'd take my daughter, and get out of here. I'll leave this place in a coffin. No time off for good behavior. And why would I leave? Outside is no better. I want to go outside, travel and see the world. I want to have a happy life with my child. Go far away to a sunny place, to the beach. I've forgotten what the fuck was I saying. I had this friend, One-Handed Luis, who had a flamenco bar. I'd go with him to Japan or anywhere. First of all, I'd eat some cured ham. I'd party. And then I'd go to the beach. Even if I were alone, I'd party. Just for her to know, and give her some time. Sure, you do what you have to do. She's blind. What? When I was in the police, she thought my partner was my guardian angel, that's why she wants to meet you. I'm not sure I'd be a good guardian angel. Let's go in. - Hello? - Hello, darling! Hello. Palacios is here. - Nice to meet you, Palacios. - Nice to meet you. Welcome! Give it to me. Come on, I'm serious. It's mine. - Hi there! - Hi, sweetie. How are you feeling, Sole? Shooting up with oxygen while I wait for my transplant. Sole, if Yolanda had left those 9 million euros to me, I'd buy you a heart. I bet you can buy hearts... Well... in India or China. In Chinatown would be better. In the sales. If Yolanda had left those 9 million euros to me, I'd use the money to hire the best medium in the world. I'd like to talk to my husband to know if he's still mad at me. In the end, I'm going to share eternity with him. I'd like to tell him it was only... an impulse. A bad impulse But still, just an impulse. - What would you do, Blondie? - Me? - I would return it. - You would return it. - What? - You can't be that silly. I don't own that money. It's been stolen. - How are you doing? - I'm cool. Can't complain. - I wanted to thank you. - Why? Getting hurt helping a nice girl is not that bad. This is better than solitary. If you're going to fuck, please, tell them to disconnect me. - Curly, to your bed. Now. - Good to see you, Doctor! - Come on, go. - How do you feel? Like a drop dead diva, Doctor. - Waiting for euthanasia. - I'll give you a prescription. - Is the favor still on? - Yes. Well then, here you are. Some little wings. And the dress is still unfinished. My wife started it, but she's ill. You'll have to finish it. It's sewn up. Will you? - I can sew it for you. - Me too. You stay in bed. Can you two do it? - Sure. - Then, there'll be a prize. Not now. You can only smell it. One for you. - Fucking awesome. Thanks. - Bye. - Bye. - See you. It must be hard to start from scratch. I mean, you weren't born blind. Well, that depends on your perspective. People who were born blind can't imagine things, like a color or the sunset. I still have the same dreams I used to have. Only now I'm much clumsier. Just take one step at a time. - Samy, go to the kitchen. - He's not bothering you, is he? No. He's just sniffing me. I have a cat, you know... - I guess Fabio told you I'm single. - No, he didn't tell me. Well, I am. A hopeless bachelor. My cat, my mother, and my Tupperware on me all the time! You're a very nice guy. One day, you should leave your cat with your mother, and get out and meet girls. But I meet new girls every day. Murderers, drug dealers... A bit of everything. I was only kidding, of course. I figured as much! - So you like your job? - Some days are better than others. I guess Fabio told you there was a murder. Now we have to put up with the interrogations, the pressure... We're freaking out. A murder? Well... No, Fabio didn't tell me at all. I guess he forgot about it. We've got a lot on our plate right now. He didn't want to upset you. Right? Yes, an inmate was murdered. But I didn't want to worry you. Sorry I didn't tell you. I wasn't in the mood to talk. Of course, I totally understand. You get home in the evening, you sit down on your couch, and you can't find the right time to say, "A woman was murdered at work." It's just natural. How did it happen? In the middle of a fight or something? Not exactly. Actually, we don't know yet... - So nobody knows how she died? - Well... We've to wait for the autopsy. Otherwise, it'd be guesswork. She was tortured and fried with a steamer. Right... Inspector Castillo is still investigating, but that seems to be it. Castillo? Your partner from Homicide Division? My parents came to see me today. First time they've seen me in jail. And how did it go? Actually, it was fine. Well, I had this horrible conversation with my dad. But it felt like the most real conversation we've ever had. - He's a former Civil Guard, you know. - No fucking shit! Those were the ones who caught me. Two bastards beat the shit out of me. Fuck, I'm sorry... - I got a bit carried away. - It's OK. I guess there's all sorts. And my father's no better. Did Fabio tell you why he changed jobs? Why he moved from the police force to the prison? No. I can't remember him talking about it. Well, two years ago someone broke into this house. I was alone. Fabio was on duty. I thought they'd look for cash and, once they saw I didn't have any, they'd just leave. But they didn't. They took my cards. They asked for my PIN number, then tied me up. They stopped at each and every ATM, and took everything I had. I was tied up for at least three hours. At one point, I managed to untie myself. I tried to call the police. Unfortunately, they caught me and beat me up. Fucking bastards! And it all could have ended there: a broken nose and two broken ribs. But it didn't. Fabio had to move heaven and earth. He set all the crime units to work. And I asked him not to. I begged him not to do that. At a dinner, just like this one. When I still could cook. And he swore he'd let it go. But he lied to me. He kept investigating. And when he arrested the first one, the others came after me. The beating was so brutal... that my optic nerve was smashed, and I lost my sight. Then, Fabio promised two things. The first being that he'd leave the force. The second, that he'd never lie to me again. Ever again. So I'm sorry if I'm... a bit dramatic. But, well... I just wanted you to know that I have a good reason. - No, it's your turn to spin around! - I can't. My wrist hurts. Then use the other hand! Hey, by the way... I talked to your girlfriend. I don't have a girlfriend. Right, whatever. Your ex-girlfriend. And I get the feeling that there's still something there. I mean she still seems to have feelings. I wouldn't like her to get any wrong ideas. Right, but I'm not going to take her back. Because she's the worst. Do you have any doubts about that? No, no. I get it. If I didn't think that, I'd never ask you to be with me. Sure, I get that. But I'm not sure you understand my position. Look... I've been put in jail, I'm not thinking about a relationship. Let alone getting in the middle of one. I don't care if it's gay, straight or any other kind. Do you understand? OK. Shall we go to the TV room? Will you come with me? Sure. Cool. Look, Thailand! I almost went there, but then I had to work. - A friend told me it's beautiful. - You! Fucking nutcase! Don't fuck with me, I'll never take you back. - I wouldn't even go near you! - Will you shut up? - Leave me alone! OK? - Shut the fuck up! We can go now. Sorry. No... God... Hello? Yes? May I? What are you still doing here? Anything wrong? Nine years of marriage, and that bastard leaves me in a letter on my birthday. "I know it's despicable to write you this letter on your birthday. But this morning I felt I couldn't take it anymore. Miranda, we've been together for nine years. Some of them were wonderful. And when they were not, we always knew how to keep going. But not this time. That's why leaving now is the best for us. Without saying goodbye. I hope that, someday, we'll get to talk about this. Goodbye." Why don't you come home with me? Sandra and the girls will be happy to see you. He took three shirts, his toilet bag... everything he could fit into three bags, and he left. Do I disgust him to the point of running away like that? He couldn't even wait for me to get out of work. What will you do? Will you talk to him? I will accuse him of desertion, and I will suck him dry. I will fuck up his life. I will destroy him. I will. Have you seen that film where it's the same day over and over again? God, what was it called? We watched it here once. That's what happens here. It's the same day over and over again. Well, we learn to do stuff. Gardening, mechanics... stuff like that. This is like university! I didn't even go to school, but here, I got my degree. - I'm learning languages. - I heard there's a drama group. Here you learn how to keep quiet. You learn how to behave and understand things. You learn how to hold back your temper and your guts... You learn how to live, dear. - Come in! - Hello. - The costume's ready. - Come in. It's so beautiful! What about these ends? Are they supposed to be like this? - Yes, the pattern's like that. - Then, it's gorgeous! Wait, I have something for you. Let's see... This... and an ointment. So go behind the folding screen to apply it and get changed, too. Thanks, but I'd rather do it in my cell. No, you can't do that. Medicines can't leave the infirmary. I'm done. When you need new cotton underwear, I'll sign a note. - Do you want a cookie? Come on! - You're such a drag! I said no! Suit yourself, Sole. How did it go? - That guy's really weird. - Why? He made me put on my underwear and the cream in his office. Bingo! Now you found his weak spot. He likes young jailbirds. Obviously, now you're his little muse, he fancies you! Listen, the more he loves you, the better you'll live here. You'll get sweet-dream pills, chocolate bars... And for free, too! - You're saying I should play along? - Let yourself be loved! - What? - Open up! I mean, your heart. Open your heart. - Open up? - And your life here will be easier. What are you talking about? I don't care if my life isn't easy! - That guy is disgusting! - Disgusting? My drunk husband asking for sex in the morning, that was disgusting! I won't suck up to this guy! Not to him, not to your gypsy or to Zulema! By the way... I reported her to the Warden. I told her she came after Yolanda. But... Are you fucking crazy? Don't run. Those are the rules. That woman is the queen of this prison. She's the wife of the Egyptian, a murderer on the loose, he's even wanted by Interpol! That man has killed about 20 people! And she doesn't care if she serves 100 or 200 years, Macarena! He's like a dog at Zulema's feet. - I'd rather talk to you in private. - Saray is like my sister. Don't diss her. All right. They've opened an investigation regarding Yolanda's murder. I will be interrogated. But I want you to know I won't say a word. - I'll keep my mouth shut. - Good. I just wanted you to know that. Zulema, I need to talk to you. You lucked out. I have something to tell you, too. I have one reason for you to keep quiet. Actually, I have two. Leopoldo and Encarna. Does it ring a bell? I heard they have this beautiful backyard, where your dad built a beautiful trellis. It'd be too bad if he didn't enjoy it after so much hard work. He will enjoy it. I've told the Warden you came after Yolanda the night she died. Inspector Castillo has been informed about this. If you harm me or my family, you'll be harming yourself. You'll prove yourself guilty. They only know you went for a cigarette with her. They have nothing on you. Let me go! I told you they have nothing on you! Leave me alone! I did this to be safe. You may feel safe, but we'll see if your father is. Go. I have two loose ends. One says she won't speak. The other one says she already did. - Which one will screw me over first? - That fucking innocent-looking bitch! If you let her, she'll destroy you. I'll take care of her. Stop. I'll deal with this the quick way. - Hi, darling. - My love! We have a problem. Who's the last one? - Who's the last one? - There's the line! - I need to make a call! - Ferreiro, do you have a card? - A card? - You need one. Put your name on the list and management grants you two calls a week. - How long will that take? - A day. - I need it now. It's an emergency. - Sure. It always is. - It's a matter of life and death. - Then do it as soon as possible. Rules are rules. I'm getting tired of rules here. Especially when they're stupid! I totally agree. But there's another list for filing complaints. Hey! No running! Anabel! I need a favor. You can get things, right? Could you get me a mobile, please? Sure. Don't expect it to be a smartphone, though. I'm your friend, not your bank. Those things are expensive. Unfortunately, more expensive than on the street. I have money. How much do you want? 400 euros, with a 10-euro credit. Right... Here. 400 euros. Thanks, darling. - Do you want anything else? - No. So when will I get my phone? When you pay me back the 2600 euros you still owe me. You lost my drug, darling. You need to pay for it, obviously. Please, I need to make a call. It's urgent. Urgent? How urgent is it? Ten chocolate bars urgent? A pack of cigarettes urgent? How much do you want? 20, 30 euros? 150 euros, and I'll give you two cards so you can use the phone. - And my spot in the line. - OK. 100. Fine. 100. Here, girl. If you want to pick up, don't mind me. The tire's changed. No, don't worry. It's not important. Fuck! Are you calling or what? - Ferreiro, are you OK? - I'm sorry. - I'm really sorry. - Do you want to talk about anything? You can go to therapy with Dr. Sandoval. Yes, I know. And I'm going to sign up. But I needed a hug. - Tere! - Yes? Go to Sandoval's office. They're looking for you. - I can see you're a father. - That's right. Of two. I'm a father, too. And I'd like to ask you a question. Pick up. - Hello? - Dad! Listen to me! You're in danger! - Maca? - They know where you live! A murderer is after you! She knows where you and mom live! I screwed up! You said, "decide." I did, and I screwed up! You're in danger! I put you all at risk! Dad, please! Listen to me, Maca. I'm not in danger. Yes, you are, Dad! Maca, I want you to do something right now. I want you to call Simon. Simon? - Why? - Call him now. Thanks. As you told me before, pick it up. - Hello? - Simon. It's Maca. Don't hang up. This will take a second. I just want to know one thing. I want to know what happened. I'll be in here for seven years, and... I want to know if you ever really loved me, or if it was all part of your plan. Honestly, I don't care about the rest anymore. But I need to know the truth. I'm so sorry. I wanted to run away with you, but... everything was falling to pieces: my family, my company... My kids... So I had to choose. I just hope you can forgive me someday. My daughter may forgive you, but I won't. Everything's fine, sweetie. - I love you. - Dad? You'll take one million euros of the money you stole, and, in 12 hours, I'll come pick it up from your house. Things will start falling into place. First: my daughter, back home. What do you think? Dad! Dad! Have you fixed the tire? - That's my family. Please... - I have a family, too. Don't try to mess with me. I have nothing to lose. Gonz?lez Largo, Teresa. Tere. Let's see how you explain this. Your tests are positive, but not for drugs. Don't worry. - You're pregnant. - What?
