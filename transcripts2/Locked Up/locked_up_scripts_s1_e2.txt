 Ricardo Guzman. - How do you do. Macarena? - Yes. I'm Anabel's lawyer. Well... I skimmed through your case. You're charged with four crimes. You were placed in pre-trial detention. Is that right? Yes, but I'm innocent. You have to get me out, please. First, I need you to tell me how you got into this situation. I don't know what we're going to do with Lupe. With your wife? What do you mean?

 In the divorce, she'll do anything to clean me out. Mistreatment, marital abandonment... I don't care. I'll start from scratch. Again. As long as I'm with you. No. It's not fair. What? You've spent your whole life working. You can't just lose it all. - It wouldn't be fair. - What do you want me to do? Change asset ownership? I don't know. No. Well, some people do it.

 Macarena. You'll get me out of here, right? Maybe a bail reduction... - A pardon. - Pardon? You're charged with fraud, concealment of assets, money laundering and theft. Two million euros. I'm surprised your bail isn't twice as much. I'm telling you I'm innocent. Listen, I'm innocent. That's irrelevant now, Macarena. Do you have one million euros or not? No. No. I don't have one million euros. I have nothing. My house, my account... Even my canary's cage was seized. If you don't have the money... I'm afraid you'll have to stay in prison. I'm not feeling well. I'll see you another day. All right. No problem. Darling, you know I love barbecues. OK. Saturday at lunchtime. Perfect. Listen, if you see Carmen, tell her I'll prepare the kid's gymkhana this time. All right. I love you too. I must hang up now. I'm busy. Bye. I'm sorry. I'm Carlos Sandoval. - I'm your doctor. - Macarena Ferreiro. Nice to meet you. Well, what happened? I felt dizzy and I couldn't breathe. - Did you feel pressure in your chest? - Yes, I still do. - Those could be anxiety symptoms. - Yeah. Take your shirt off and sit on the table. Let me see... Macarena Ferreiro. Cell 225. Pre-trial detention for fraud, concealment of assets and theft. It seems the D.A. thinks you should be here. Yes. I'll check your lungs. Inhale through your mouth. OK. Your lungs are all right. I'll get you a tranquillizer because your pulse is fast. Are you allergic to any medication? - No. - And to injections? Well... All right. Close your fist. There we go. That's it. Done. All right. Lie down. That's it. You can count on me for whatever you need. If you change your lawyer, a medical report to avoid a new trial... Maybe ask for release privileges or a reduction. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Or drugs to feel better. Anxiolytics, sleeping pills... A healthy diet... A cell with a sea view. I could be your Santa. You, one of my reindeer. Yolanda Montero. With reductions, only three weeks left because of release privileges. I'll get to the point, who the fuck was on duty last night? Fabio and I were in the control room until noon. Then we did the usual rounds until we found the corpse. That's it. A girl was killed while you were watching the monitors and "that's it"? No, I was watching the monitors. I was extracting milk and I didn't notice anything weird. Warden, the question is how that girl could take a stroll at 1 a.m. Don't stray from the subject, please. I'm not straying from the subject. Why are the cells open at night? Is this a student dorm, a pajama party? The guidelines advise a controlled free movement policy. We have the lowest suicide rate. We can't lock them up for 20 hours. You think you're Gandhi for prisons? No. But I believe things can be done differently. If you think making a documentary and listening to the violin will make them happier, you have no fucking idea what's going on. Dignity! That's what I'm trying to give them. Right to privacy without having to defecate in a tiny cell. You'd be better trying to protect them from themselves. They're not exchange students, they're murderers. You've seen it. Don't ever tell me what to do. Colleagues, please... We won't get anywhere by shit slinging all day. It won't help us find a solution. Can we focus on this? - What happened to the security cams? - They put magnets on the hard drives. The police are investigating. They were deleted deliberately. Only officers can access the control room. I hope not, otherwise one of us would be an accessory to this crime. Fabio. - What do we know from the autopsy? - They seem to have a vague idea. The girl was boiled at 194 degrees with a clothes steamer. - Why would anyone do that? - To torture her. The question is did she tell them about the nine million euros? Stop it! I'll smash your face! Take her away before I get into trouble! Bitch! Are you OK? You look pale. I need to rest. You want a joint? Anabel can get you anything you need. If you want a job when you get out, with that face I can get you 10,000 a month. - And with this one? - A turd. Whore. - What's wrong with her? - Well... Somebody stole somebody's girlfriend... No way. - Curly. - No way! In the showers. You pulled it off on the first attempt. Hold on. I didn't steal anybody's girlfriend. They can get back together for all I care. I just want them to leave me alone. Besides, she can't be my girlfriend because I'm heterosexual. In prison, you'd rather be somebody's girlfriend than everybody's. How did things go with the lawyer? Bad. He won't be able to help me. I'm sorry, honey. - But I did you that favor. - Yes, and I appreciate it. You know what you could do for me? At 9:10 p.m. you must go to the yard. Someone will give you something. Bring it to me. But it's closed at nine. - I can't be there. - That won't be a problem. - What is it? - A little something. I have to know what it is and who's gonna give it to me. Don't ask so many questions. Take this. Use this card to open the yard door and come back to the cell... with my package. No. I won't do that. No. Yes. Yes, you will. Do you know why? Because I can tell Zulema that you said she came for Yolanda last night. Before she was found dead. Do you know what Zulema does to snitches? She kills them. You'll do great. Get ready! In the dining room in five! The convicts already know about Yolanda. It's all they're talking about. Check number ten. I think they passed a spike or something. - Look. - Shit! I'll stop this right now. Thanks. Don't even think of trying the peas. They're big as hell and fluorescent. They must import them from Fukushima. Attention! Inspection! Everybody stand up! Do not move. Hands on your head. Single file. If you have a spike, you'll go to solitary confinement. - You're fucking brave, Paloma. - Even though she's small. Governor, I have nothing, you know it full well. - I've been behaving very well lately. - Shut up and turn around. What is it? Do you have a spike? No, worse. I have a card for opening the doors. And it looked like butter wouldn't melt in your mouth. On three, you'll get rid of it. - What? - One... Two... What are you doing? What are you touching? - Fucking bitch. - Attention. Fight in the dining room. You hurt me! Abuse! This is abuse! Fuck! Let go of me! Abuse! Silence! Everyone get in line! - Governor. - What? What the hell is this doing here? A key card. Let me see... - Do I cut the zucchini? - Cut it in slices. - Like this? - Yes, that's perfect. Your daughter is lovely. - How old are you? - Seven. Dad. Take this. Mom. Although Macarena isn't here, Lidia and I wanted to tell you that... ...we're getting married. That's great, honey. Let's toast then. To the happy couple! My dear... - Did you tell your sister? - When could I? We were meeting for lunch, but she didn't think it important. Yes, yes. He'd be so excited if it was Macarena's wedding. - Listen... - It's OK. - This way we can practice weddings. - Well, this is my second practice. Why don't you answer? Hello. - Mom. - Macarena, honey. - How are you? - Do you have a minute? Go on. Do you remember when they put a dead bird... ...in my school backpack? And... ...when they used to stick the pages of my books with chewed gum? - Of course I remember, honey. - And do you remember you always got angry because I didn't tell you about it? Yes. But what's wrong? Mom, I... I did that because... - I couldn't see you suffer. - Why do you talk about that now? Little by little, I got used to telling you half of my life. The small beautiful part of it. But there's nothing beautiful left to be told, Mom. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Mom... I'm in prison. Mom, say something, please. I fell in love with a married man... - and he tricked me. - We'll get you a good lawyer. He'll be your lawyer. You must keep calm and trust me. In the hearing, I'll take responsibility for embezzling the money. - You were tricked. We'll appeal. - Go on. No, Mom. No. I got seven years. Four crimes. But you'll explain it all, honey. The transfer has already been made. This 200,000, raise it to 1,800,000. But, Simon... We're bankrupting the component branch. I know, Maca. But we must do all we can to save this company. You were tricked, you'll explain it to them. No, Mom. I won't be able to explain it. I'll never be able to do it. - Hello? - Hi, Maca. - Where are you? - In the car park. - Bring me the money from the safe. - Now? I made illicit transactions by proxy. - It'll be easier taking it to Panama. - What do you mean? I embezzled the company. Put it in a bag, bring it. I took the money out myself over several days. Maca. I love you. Almost two million euros disappeared. They proved I stole them. But how could you steal two million euros? Just by looking in your eyes, anyone can tell how sweet you are. No, Mom. I'm not. If you ask for a favor, make sure you can pay it back as soon as possible. How could the convicts get this? - I don't have a clue. - You don't have a clue? If cons can get cards and delete tapes, how can I guarantee safety? It's your job. And this means you're not doing it right. Paloma. Paloma, what's wrong? Do you need two more weeks off? No, I'm fine. It's hard, but I can handle it. I need you to organize an inspection of all the cells. Tonight. Right away, Warden. Attention. All Cell Block 2 inmates must line up in front of their cells. An inspection will take place. Where's Macarena? Attention. All Cell Block 2 inmates must line up in front of their cells. An inspection will take place. Everyone still in front of the doors. Attention, inspection! - What? - Let me through. There's nothing here! - Ferreiro, come out! - What if I search your underpants? Ferreiro! Where's Ferreiro? - Ferreiro is missing. - Don't fuck with me, Fabio. I'm going to the laundry. Go find her immediately. Two, two. Palacios, go to the yard! Help! Help! - It's okay. - Someone locked me up. - Calm down. - They locked me up. I couldn't get out. Can you walk? Let's go, then. Where's the man who tricked you? Who is he? Were you in a relationship with the accused? That's absolutely false. - Where was she? - They had locked her up. - Where? - In the yard. In the ball crate. Search her. She fell in love. Then she got obsessed. Do you mean the theft and the embezzlement were motivated by your refusal? Yes, Your Honor. Out of spite. That's what I think. Solitary confinement. No! No... Please! No! I can't stay here for two weeks. Nine million euros. Do you have one million euros or not? If you don't have the money, I'm afraid you'll have to stay in prison. Attention, all inmates, today is the last day to enroll on the IT course. The rooms are better than I expected, Mom. They change the sheets every week and everything is clean. It's like a boarding school. The food is okay. It's similar to what they gave me at the Jesuit school. I usually work out in the morning: jogging, gymnastics... We have lots of free time, so I'm reading a lot. They have a huge library. With classical authors, mainly. LIFE IS A BITCH There's three of us now. Because there's a vacancy. One of the girls left. Soon we'll be four again. Mom, I'm keeping away from those who committed violent crimes. These are... ...nice people. Hey! - Hey! - I also made some new friends. - Anybody there? - We spend our free time chatting. Hello? You're new in the hole, right? Yes. Last night was my second night here. I've been here for a week. Do you know what time it is? No, I guess it's morning. These motherfuckers turn the lamps on every two hours for their rounds. You don't know if it's day or night. I usually guess by the meals but they keep changing them too. Why are you here? They caught me with 300 grams of drugs. On my first day. - A strong start. - The drugs weren't mine. Yes. That old chestnut. Same one as always, right? She does her business and we pay for it. If you don't want to, you don't need to tell me. Just don't say a word to the officers. It was my cellmate, Anabel. I owed her a favor. Would you like some advice? - Don't sit on the floor all day. - But that's all I feel like doing. If you don't move, you'll end up needing to be carried, like those astronauts coming back to Earth because your muscles have wasted. I know. Try to exhaust yourself, jump, walk, do push-ups... Whatever. You need to be tired or you won't sleep. All right. I'll try. I think they're coming to take me out. Take care! Hey! Thanks. See you soon. Good luck. It's a sprained wrist. A small ligament rupture. - Does it hurt here? - Yes. I'll prescribe you an anti-inflammatory. We don't have any here. I'll be right back. I don't feel like it. - You know it's a compulsory checkup. - Why a checkup? I'm clean, Doctor. Warden's orders. If it's not coming, drink more water. Asshole. Hey! Do you use, newbie? - Do you use? - No, of course not. Then piss in here. Or I'll be caught and put in isolation. Thanks for the confidence, but I'm not pissing anywhere. They caught you with the drugs, but they'll screw me. - You owe me this. - No, I owe you nothing. Losing the drugs wasn't my fault. Come on. If we don't help each other, they'll lock me in a hole without codeine or methadone. Blondie... Please, help me out here. Thanks. Hurry up, Sandoval is about to come back. If you rush me, it won't come out. Sure. Yes. Estefania, let's take the X-ray. You're the best, Blondie. They may ask me for another one tonight. How did you get out of isolation? - No one caught with heroin does. - Yes. I'm injured. A sprained wrist. - That's a good excuse. Right, Tere? - What? Should we give the spoiled brat a bandage so nobody knows she's a rat? What do you mean, a rat? A rat is a snitch. You're wrong. I didn't snitch on anyone. You and I were the last two people who saw Yolanda alive. I was asleep. Let me see. I'm a real bitch. You won't trick me with bandages. Nobody sleeps the first night. Listen, newbie. I'm not saying I'm guilty. But they have it in for me here. And if you tell them that, they might even accuse me of murder. Do you catch my drift? - I guess you're threatening me. - Let me think... Yes. Zulema... - Are you okay? - It's my period. I need a painkiller. You'd better go to the yard, squat and press your kidneys with your fingers. Here. You won't go back to solitary, you'll stay here under my watch. Here you are. That's it. Doctor, I just pissed. I can see that. Leave it there. - You'll see I'm fit as a fiddle. - As a fiddle, right. Done? I'll take this. Four, two. Take your time. Thank you. I don't know what to tell them. Your parents are supposed to be there no matter what, without explanations. Trouble is I told them I was sailing in the Mediterranean. I've never done anything to worry them. This is the first time in my life I've done something unpredictable. - And look how I ended up. - Come here. Take the sling off and hide the bandage. Here, take some chocolate. If you go in eating chocolate, they won't think this place is that bad. Thank you. Four, three. - Hugging is not allowed. - What? For more than five seconds. No exchanging of goods, clothes, or food. Those are the rules. Move away, please. How are you, honey? - Do they give you chocolates in jail? - Yes. They are thoughtful sometimes. Do you want some? I'm all right, Mom. I had so much to tell you and I've just gone blank. Tell us about it. How many women in your cell? There's three of us now, but... A girl just left so there's a vacancy, soon we'll be four again. Are you grouped according to your crimes? Mom, I'm not living with violent felons or anything... They are... ...nice people. Honey, your brother is getting married. To the judge, you know. They haven't set the date yet, of course. She's a good girl. - You look skinny. - Mom! I've only been here two days. I look the same as when I got in. Did you do something bad? The only bad thing I did was getting involved with a married man who was also my boss and who deceived me. But I can't get out of here because they set a one million-euro bail. - One million euros? - Yes. - We don't have one million euros. - Darling... Even if we sold our house or three houses. Darling. I'll go to the hall for a second. I need some fresh air. Mom, please. I've had enough of this bullshit, Maca. I don't believe a word you said. I've been in the Civil Guard long enough to know nobody is charged with four crimes for nothing. So start talking. We changed the ownership and I falsified the accounting. I liquidated the company withdrawing the cashflow and the money disappeared. But he stole everything. I didn't do it. That's the truth. The truth? Same as when you told us you were sailing on a boat? Or when you said you'd met a wonderful man we couldn't meet because he was in Barcelona? Or the same truth as telling your mother jail is like a summer camp? - I don't want to hurt her. - You've already hurt us. Look, young lady. I've tried to teach you what is right and what is wrong. And when you know something's wrong, you can't stand idly by, like a wimp. You make a decision and act. Maybe that's why you're here. You haven't made a decision in your whole life. Listen, Dad. And then leave. I'm innocent. Whatever you think now is up to you. By tomorrow, I'll know if that's true. - Can you make a ponytail? - A ponytail? - Can you? - Yes. Then make it. Now. You can solve any problem in here with money. You'll find 500 euros under the table. Take it discreetly. Wait, hold on. Go on. Put it inside your ponytail. Liver or fish? - Fish. - I don't have any here. They'll bring you some from the kitchen. Next! We need the mackerel right now! When you know something's wrong, you make a decision and act. You can't stand idly by. You haven't made a decision in your whole life. Maybe that's why you're here. Yo, newbie! Here's your fish. Give it to her. Your food, rat. Eat it. No. Eat it. Now. - No. - Eat it! Who's the first one to go to solitary confinement? Stop it now! What's going on here? I can't eat the fish. I swear I can't. Fuck's sake. Eat it. Then you can throw it up in the toilet. Those are the rules. - I won't make it to the toilet. - Come on, eat. They spat on her food. Were you really going to eat it? Yes, I guess so. Why? Because I'm a wimp. Tell me to take two million euros of dirty money to a car park, and I do it. Want to register properties in my name? Give me the papers. I'll sign them. And if I fall in love, it has to be a married man with children. Same thing with the fish. Have you ever let down someone you care about you? This is more than enough for my father. He's had a bypass, I don't think he'll survive any more shocks. Keep calm. If you knew... If you knew that something was happening here... what would you do? Rat them out or keep it to yourself? - This is not high school. - Of course it's not. Instead of sending you to the thinking corner, they kill you. And I only have two options. Telling the truth and ending up sliced open... Or shutting my mouth and ending up the same way. What do you know about what's happening here? The night Yolanda died was my first night here. I know. Nobody sleeps the first night. Yolanda was holding my hand when Zulema showed up. She called her out and they went to have a smoke. A couple of hours later, I started hearing noises. Doors, lights... Rushing footsteps. I guess that was when they found her. And... Did you see or hear anybody else in that period of time? I didn't see anyone, but I did hear something. Footsteps and things like that. Then, the cells were sealed. You've been brave telling me this, Macarena. I'll inform Inspector Castillo and ask him for maximum discretion. I don't care if you are not discreet. I witnessed something and I hope justice will prevail. For that girl. For Yolanda.
