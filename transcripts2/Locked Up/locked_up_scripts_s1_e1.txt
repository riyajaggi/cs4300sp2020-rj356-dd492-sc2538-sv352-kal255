 - Mom? - Macarena? - How are you, honey? - Good. Hey, I'm going on vacation, on a boat trip. Really? Who are you going with? Simon, the guy I talked to you about, remember? - You just decided to do it? - Yes, I have some free time. - So I was like, "Why not?" - What about tomorrow's lunch? - Dad was so excited about it. - I know. Can you tell him? You'll know how to break it to him. Don't worry, honey. Hey, be careful. The ocean is dangerous.

 Yes, Mom, but it's the Mediterranean, not the Atlantic. We'll go to Formentor, Cerdena... Good luck. Okay, honey. Have a good time. Call me whenever you can, all right? Coverage will be spotty. Okay. How long will you be away? Macarena Ferreiro... do you understand the charges against you? Do you understand you're facing a seven-year sentence? Macarena, honey? I don't know. We haven't decided yet. About a month tops.

 Okay. Have fun, darling. - Mom? - Yes? I love you. I love you too, honey. Take many pictures, dress warm, and eat a lot. Good-bye. - Regards from Dad. - Okay. Bye. Whenever you're ready. CORRECTION OFFICER INMATE ENTRY Our girl just called. She's going on vacation with some friends. An unexpected trip came up. She's not coming for lunch tomorrow? Turn it off and remember the PIN number. You'll probably forget it in seven years. Everything here is size eight, and there are six changes of underwear. Thank you, but I brought my own underwear. I'm allergic to polyester. That's a resistance band. For stretching. Anti-lice shampoo? That's not drugs. It's nothing weird, just royal jelly. For body's defenses. Forty pills? - What will you do when they run out? - I hope to be out by then. I'm here by mistake. I'll change my lawyer and clear up everything. This is a private prison, no personal items are allowed. You'll wear the clothes we give you. A contact number, please. A relative's or friend's, in case of an emergency. What kind of emergency? Accidents, heart-attacks... - Getting shivved. - Hey, curly! Do you mind? I'll give you my parents', but please call them only as a last resort. I didn't tell them I'm here. What did you say to them? That I'm on a boat trip. You kidding me? Number, please. 91... 253... 3223. Follow me. My name is Paloma Garrido, I'm the unit chief. But all the inmates call me "Governor." Take off your clothes, please. Leave them in the numbered trays. Here, at Cruz del Sur, the day begins at seven. When you hear the alarm tomorrow, you'll have 15 minutes to get dressed, make the bed, and line up for the count. Then you'll have breakfast and do a prison job that will be informed to you. Any questions? Can I make a call? You need a formal request approved by the head office for that. Can you put me down for it? Anything else? They didn't let my toiletry bag in. Will you give us soap and toothbrush? You got a basic kit. For anything else, there's the commissary where you can buy things. What about the money? You took all the money I had. You'll get prison checks in exchange for your work. - Anything else? - Do the cells have toilets? No, dear. There's one communal bathroom for each unit. No chatting in the hallways. You're newbies. As soon as you go through that door, you'll be humiliated into submission. They'll make you hide their drugs, carry them, pick them up at fake face-to-face meetings. Don't do it. Stand behind the yellow line. Turn around. Hands on the wall. Spread your legs. They'll ask for money and favors in exchange of protection. Don't give in to them. I recommend you show good behavior. Crimes in here will only increase your sentence. And they will immediately ruin any chance of sentence reduction. I'm having my period. Fabio. Come in. Next time, you won't get a 20-day suspension without pay. Next time you'll get the axe. Is that clear? Yes, ma'am, it's clear. Good. Now I want you to apologize, patch up your differences, and start behaving like workmates. All right? Listen, Valbuena. I was wrong. I shouldn't have punched you. Yes? Yes, I called you. Next time, it won't be a punch. I'll rip your head out and bury it in a pile of shit. Now that we're good, please, accept my apologies. Damn it, Valbuena. Valbuena, come on. What happened? He'll get over it. We're surrounded by violence, Fabio. We should set a good example for those women. - That guy is an asshole. - Out. Clear the hallways in Unit Two. I repeat. Clear the hallways in Unit Two. Attention to all serious offenders, proceed to courtyard in five minutes. I have three for Unit Two, and one for Unit Three. Hey, bitch! Do you have a stick up your ass? Get out of here, Governor! Juana Rodriguez, cell 202. See you in the showers! See you in the showers! Clara Gomez. Cell 233. Quiet! Macarena Ferreiro, cell 234. Governor, this must be a mistake. We're full here. Macarena Ferreiro was assigned to this cell. Ferreiro, put your things on that shelf and make your bed. - Hold it, newbie. - Do as I said, Ferreiro. - Don't. - Do it. - No. - Do it, Ferreiro. No. You can keep your pet, but you can't do whatever you want. I'm just informing the unit chief that we're a bit crammed here. One more inmate and she'll have to sleep on the floor. Right, girls? - Answer, bitch. - Yes. Good. I'll take her before you drag her down. You're wrong if you think you have the upper hand here. Be careful. Let's go. Why don't you check your cell? Governor. And we'll see who has the upper hand and who should be careful. I'd like to change the phone number for emergencies. I'll give you my brother's. My dad has a bypass. You can ask for that tomorrow. - Back in duty? - It seems so. Good. Fabio, do me a favor. Take the new one to cell 225. Ferreiro. Thanks. - Let's go. - Blondie! Are you hungry? We're having pussy here! Macarena Ferreiro. Cell 225. No. I can't. What's wrong? I don't know. I think I'm having an anxiety attack. I need to see a doctor, please. Any trembling? - No. - Blurred vision? Dizziness, cramps, chest pains? - No. - Then you're all right. Macarena Ferreiro. Cell 225. Hi, I'm new. My name is Macarena. Welcome, honey, to Cruz del Sur's presidential suite. She's so pale, as if she'd seen a ghost. - Snow White. - I... And the seven dwarfs. - I'm just tired. - She's tired. You'll have plenty of time to rest here. - Is that my bed? - Yes, right under mine. We used it 24/7. That's where we all masturbated together, but now it's private property, girls. - I'll lie down. - Your hair is so blonde. Does the carpet match the drapes? Clam color defines eyebrow color. Right, you'll fuck her in no time. - She's too skinny. - Get some rest, honey. - You must be beat. - She's cute... BLOCKED NUMBER An interview? What for? Ready? Shut up! I'm doing an interview here! Okay, I'll tell you. I'm here for personal reasons. Because I'm innocent. When I got home, I found my cousin, One-eyed, trying to fuck my kid. I whipped his ass. We beat the hell out of each other. I completely lost it. Several homicides. We took a friend's car. It was stolen. Suddenly, all the alarms went off. It was wild, hell broke loose. They caught us. My first day here? You don't believe you'll be here for such a long time. You get here, they put you in, they... They frisk you. They get you naked, they frisk you... Like getting raped. I'm more sorry for them than for myself. You know what's like to stick up your finger in all these bitches' asses? The first day I felt like a queen. They gave me clothes, towels. Even buffet lunch. It's like being at a resort, but surrounded by mega-bitches. No, Macarena, darling, you're doing it wrong. You have to tuck in both the sheet and the blanket. If you leave it hanging, you'll get a penalty. What's your story, girl? Me? I come from downtown Madrid. She meant what brought you here. I shouldn't be here, it was a mistake. How many years did you get for that mistake? - Seven. - Must have been a very big mistake. We're all here by mistake. Do you believe in God, hon? I went to a Catholic school. I became a believer here. Nothing beats praying before sleep. Oh, Lord, please, help the newbie. - What a pain. - Please. Help her show repentance. - No one gets seven years over nothing. - Don't mind that shit. - Hey, I'm fucking praying here. - Sorry. - And help Yolanda. - Thanks. She's leaving in three weeks. Don't let us meet ever again, please. You'll fucking miss me, you'll see. And, please, help Anabel as well. Because if I needed a light to find my way, she's going to need all the Christmas city lightning. - Amen. - Amen! That good Samaritan burned his husband. Can you keep quiet? You burned your husband? After 16 years of beating, kicking, spitting, and general abuse, I caught him in bed with my best friend. Know what a burned man smells like? No. Like streaky bacon. Bacon. - Nice. - Rotten bacon. Do you like bacon, Macarena? SILENCE Do you know what Allah and Jesus have in common? No. They're both everywhere and can see everything. That must be the feeling up there. Up where? In the CCTV control room. Do you have an extra toothbrush? - No, I don't. - Really? You got lucky. With the cell they gave you. Could've been way more shitty. Get away from me, nutjob! I said get away. Why are you here? I ran a business with my mom. - A go-go bar. - Big deal. I also ran a little business. I sold coke. - Why don't you take a hike? - I don't feel like it. Men hate seeing women succeed from the bottom. And you two started right from the bottom, sucking cunt. She's a madam. She had 11 whorehouses, she brought Romanian girls by bus. Hard-working whores. But they were free, they kept their own passports. Yeah, right, a fine businesswoman you were. You just had a market of hot pussies. Yoli is the real deal here. Yolanda? She's the smartest in the house. In three weeks, she'll be in Brazil at a five-star hotel. Brazil! Why are you here, hon? Theft, trafficking, prostitution? No, I'm here by mistake. Seriously. I need a new lawyer, but I have to wait until Wednesday. - I can get you one. - Really? - For tomorrow. - That would be... First rule in prison. Never ask for favors, right, Anabel? Well, I'll ask for favors. I will. I'm desperate here. I need to get out. Tomorrow morning you'll have your lawyer. Just leave it to me. Thank you. Good night. Night, girl. The first night is the worst. You can't help hearing everything. Everything. The footsteps, the doors, the flushing, the snoring. Everything. Then you get used to it. Relax. It's okay, girl. We all cry on our first night. Here. For protection. The Virgin of Macarena. For Macarena. Thank you. You're welcome. That's cool. The infinite. Nah, it's just an eight. The Chinese lucky number. If it works in China, why not here, right? You can hold my hand to sleep. I don't mind. You'll feel calmer, you'll see. That's okay. It's okay now. But that's not enough. As you know, we're still in a very delicate situation. It's imperative to increase our capital. Now our finance manager will inform us about the recapitalization process. Macarena, please. As the president said, we need an injection of capital. Cash, to pay creditors and banking entities. The forecasts for the next six months... suggest that the company won't survive without new capital investments. Here's an example. As you can see... Yoli. Yoli... Are you asleep? Sort of. Let's have a smoke in the bathroom. I've had a bad day. - I don't have any tobacco. - I do. The warden had it in for you. She made you hold hands with him like good boys. - Like in a school yard. - You have to cool it with Valbuena. Smooth things over. I just let his bullshit go in one ear and out the other. Don't play his game. It's not worth it, Fabio. Promise me. Fine, I promise. What's with you and rules? I'm the only guy you get along with and we've never had a beer together. - Is that normal to you? - Don't give me that shit. Why is the laundry room door open? Hello? Anybody there? How did you get in? You'll get solitary confinement for this. Fuck. Shit. What the hell happened to her? Her eyes are completely white. Look away. Let's get out. Paloma, lock down the cells, we have a situation. Miranda, sorry to wake you up. I wasn't sleeping. All right. Listen, I think you should come here. Something serious just happened. Obviously, she didn't die a natural death. - Of course not. - Oh, God, oh, God... - Why is she pink? - All right. It's okay. Everybody out. The police are on their way. I want to have kids, I love kids. I want to have a house with a nice garden. Travel around. I haven't been abroad. I've only been to Ceuta. Maybe... Maybe fall in love, but... I don't know. Have kids. Count is clear. Go to the showers. Are you blind, man? Yolanda's missing! Where is she? I saw her leaving last night with that brunette girl. - Which one? - Zulema? Yes. Let's go have a shower. I don't feel good, I'll stay here. Honey, you're in jail, nobody feels good here. Careful with what you say. Or you'll end up being a servant. What's a servant? A miserable girl who didn't pay back a favor in time. Or betrayed a big shot. If you ask for a favor, make sure you pay it back right away. Okay? Let's go. Come on. I left her. My wife. At last. It's over. I love you. Put some cream on me, come on. Harder. Zulema... Zulema, what about what I asked? Give me. You. Come on. Please, Zulema, don't. "Please, don't." Come on. Go on. It's not that big a deal. Hi, blondie. Hi. - Can I have some gel, please? - Sure. Thanks. I'm Estefania. - They call me "Curly" here. - I'm Macarena. Macarena? - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. How many years did you get? I'm waiting for my trail, but they're asking for seven. Seven years here without a partner is a long time. I broke up a couple days ago. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. It was a shitty relationship. I needed a change. You wanna be my girlfriend? - What? - Do you want to be my girlfriend? Thanks. I mean, no. Thank you, I'm very flattered. But I can't because... I don't like women. I'm straight. That's okay, we're all straight here. I don't need an answer today. You can tell me later. Think about it. - Okay. - Cool. - Teresita. - They asked me the question. What question? About my sex life. Just don't bitch about anyone, okay? See you. Women get cozy. You miss hugs, kisses, I don't know. There are a lot of new dykes here. I've been one all my life. They want love, that's it. Are you a lesbian? There are only women and officers here. And... if you compare them, you'll pick women. People don't want you. So you feel free. From the waist down, I'm dead. I don't have any sexual feelings. Not even... Look. Not even Mr. Finger. Look. I even got a callus. - Please. - Don't take it off! - But my hair is a mess. - I'll look terrible! It's mine. Tere. Fucking junkie. I wish she was dead. Cut. POLICE LINE DO NOT CROSS How's your wife? Not that bad. She's getting used to her new life. We miss you at the station. They gave me a damn Chinese man as a partner. He wouldn't see evidence even if it were inside a glowing circle. Go fuck yourself, Castillo. - There you have it. - What can you tell me? She was boiled. Boiled? With steam. At 195 degrees. Thanks. - What the fuck are you doing here? - What does it look like? - That's my fucking seat. - What's your fucking problem? - Get off my seat. - Don't touch her. Cool it! All right. Hey, come join us. Sit here. No, thanks. Thanks, anyway. I'm not hungry. I'm not on a hunger strike. I just can't get myself to eat all this. You can stick your fingers down your throat later, but now you have to eat it. It's mandatory. I can't even hold the spoon. Eat it up. Good. Excuse me. I made a friend last night. Well, kind of. Her name is Yolanda. She was missing this morning. Is she being punished? Something happened to her? She died. What do you mean? - Was it an accident? - They're investigating. By the way, did you see her leaving her cell last night? Oh, gosh, sorry. Good morning. Sorry. Finish your breakfast. Do you mind? Just ten hours ago, my friend was up there saying stupid things. Could you take her stuff later, please? I need a bit more time to mourn. Beds have to be available. The newbies won't come until tomorrow. Please. Just a bit of humanity. Yolanda's life ended up in a 60-centimeter box. All our lives will. We should keep this picture. What is it, girl? I heard Yolanda is dead. What happened to her? If it's not disease, there are only two other options. Suicide or homicide. Many people here wanted Yolanda dead. Why? Yolanda did an amazing robbery. Sorry, I'm not familiar with all the details. Everything is specified on the report. Yolanda and her boyfriend bought two totaled cars at a junkyard. They set them on fire on the road where an armored truck was carrying nine million euros. It was the perfect plan. Everybody robs banks with a gun and a sock on their head. But not her. The officers saw a lethal accident and two victims. A man with blood on his face carrying an agonizing woman. - Help! - Let's go. Help me, please! Help! - Don't move! - It was Yolanda. They made the guys open the door, pointed a gun at them, and took nine million euros. They had the dough. But also two patrol cars on their heels. So they caught her? But she kept them entertained for a while first. The chase lasted 39 minutes around local roads. And it ended up in a shootout. Her boyfriend died. When we arrested her, there was no sign of the money. They buried it somewhere between Madrid and Segovia. They never found the money? And not for lack of searching. She took that secret to her grave. She outsmarted the police... their dogs... the inspectors... everyone. Yolanda switched her SIM card at the last minute, when she realized they were about to get caught. I assume she swallowed the other one. - She ate it. - What makes you so sure about that? Because the SIM card in her cell was different from the one she used to download data and find her way during the chase. We didn't know that until we talked with the phone operator. The card she took must have the location of the money. Maybe coordinates, pictures. Who knows. Everybody thought she was keeping some clue in here. Those bitches would get into our cell and rummage through everything, making a total mess. Are you telling me an inmate killed her to get that information? That's what I'd like you to understand, Director. Somebody's setting up a jailbreak.
