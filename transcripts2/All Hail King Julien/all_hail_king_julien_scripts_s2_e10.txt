 ♪ Y'all tell me who's the king ♪ ♪ Whoa, oh, whoa, oh ♪ ♪ All hail King Julien! ♪ And done... Are you making a statue of Mort, Your Majesty? No! Even better! I've encased Mort in sand! Mainly so the royal eardrums can get a break from all his annoying Mort-ness. Hey, Mort, say something annoying like you do. [Mort mumbling] [giggles] See? Works great. [laughs]

 You next, Mo-Mo. Let's see... gonna need a lot more sand. [groans] [grunting with effort] [exclaims in pain] [clinking sound] Look, Maurice! A message! [gasping and coughing] [inhales] A message? What's it say? Yes, Maurice, what does it say? "Dear Sir, Madam, and my dearest friend..." Oh! It's from my dearest friend! "I write you today in very honest sincerities. I am a king that has lost my kingdom. Please send me one thousand mangoes to help me regain my throne. Whatever you send will be returned to you four times more back in return." Four times the mangoes in return! I don't know, King Julien. Sounds kinda like a scam. Always so suspicious. What has made your heart so cold, Maurice? Who hurt you? [gasps] It's so exciting. If we send 1000 mangoes, we'll get, um... five... eighteen... bracket, unbracket... It's like a lot of mangoes, people! Let's do this! [grunting] Bye-bye, mangoes! [laughs] [exclaims] [grunting] Object acquired. Huh. A map. [chuckling] Color me intrigued. [grunts] This is the spot... wait! There! Could be an unknown explosive device. [chuckles] Defusing. Pull the red ribbon first... or the blue... Blue or red? Blue. No, red! [grunting] Throwing stars? They're so... Beautiful. Oh! "Clover, these are for you. More gifts await if you can find them. Embrace the danger! Your Secret Admirer." I... I've got a... a secret admirer? [snoring] [raft thumps] Wait? Look! [laughs joyously] It worked! [exclaims in delight] We got four times as many mangoes back! Just like the poor king said. I don't get it. Something's off. [shivers] Why did it suddenly get so cold? Did someone leave the door to Maurice's frozen heart open? [exclaims] Ow! King Julien! You got another message. [laughs] Give it a read, Iceman. "Dear exquisitely handsome and generous sir, and or madam..." [grunting] Bye-bye, bananas! [grunting] Bye-bye, pok poks! [grunting] Bye-bye, birthday cakes! [grunting] Bye-bye, trees! [grunting] Bye-bye, huts! -[grunting] -Bye, King Julien! Bye-bye, all the lemurs in the kingdom! You gave away the whole kingdom. I know, isn't it great! We're gonna get four times back in return! That's four kingdoms, Maurice! Count it! One, two, four! Eh... And now, all we have to do is wait. [clock ticking] [crickets chirp] [rooster crows] [crickets chirping, rooster crowing] Ugh! We forgot to send these bones! [grunting] [exclaims in awe] A traditional recurved crossbow with laser sighting and belt-fed bolt action? Whoever this guy is, he really gets me! "If you would like to meet, I will be waiting atop this mountain. Come alone." [sighs] That's pretty far. But so worth it! I gotta meet this guy! [Maurice] I don't think anything's coming, Your Majesty. Don't be hatin', Mo-Mo. I'm sure there's an explanation. That poor king probably needs help loading all those return rafts. Let's go so Mort can give him a hand. [exclaims] [crickets chirping, rooster crowing] Good call bringing the bones, Maurice! I didn't wanna bring the stinkin' bones. They give me the heebie-jeebies. [shudders] Look! An island! [shouts] [Maurice] I don't know, King Julien. This place gives me the creeps. [Julien] Hello. Hello? My dearest friend! It's me! Your sir or madam! [shouts] -Crimson? -Hi, pookie-wookie. Miss me? [sighs in relief] For a second I thought we were in trouble. Give me a hug, sister girl. [Julien groans] Crimson, I'm sensing a little anger on your part like there's some kind of rift between us. Have I done something to upset you? You promised to marry her and then broke it off leaving her standing at the altar sad and alone. Remember that? Come on, I do that kind of stuff all the time. It's nothing personal. You escaped me once, but you won't escape me again. [grunts] Pull it inside! [all exclaim] [all grunting in effort] Welcome to... Prison Watch! This just in... Spring break is canceled forever! [sobbing] Sprang break... I was framed, I tell ya! Framed! Everybody is so miserable. This is like the worst place ever. I guess it's the maid's week off because that shower is F-O-U-L filthy! And it's full of monkeys. And one of them snapped me in the heinie with its wet tail! We, we're all gonna die! [laughs maniacally] Weight lifting? Forced labor? A dubious shower situation? It's like a prison or something. Your Majesty, it is a prison. Oh! Well, that-- Oh... Okay, Crimson, I get it. You're upset with me for some reason. But why take it out on my people? Oh, I'm not the one interested in your people, shmoopie bear... he is. Meet your Secret Mystery King. [sing-song] Hello, Nephew. [exclaims] Uncle King Julien? You are correct, sir. I want to thank you for giving me my kingdom back, one raft at a time. [laughs mockingly] I can't believe that you fell for the old "king in trouble" thing. [continues laughing] What a mook. Huh? [groans] Nephew, welcome to your new home... Feartopia! [sinister music playing] Gonna go out on a limb and say that name is not gonna draw the crowds. Well, I don't need to draw the crowds. Everybody is here! And guess what? That's the only gate. And I have the only key. So tough brownies! Nobody's leaving! My kingdom, my rules. And you're all going to obey them. [scoffs] Please, my booty doesn't play by the rules. Yeah. Well, it's gonna learn! Bring forth the Iron Booty! [disco song playing] ♪ Iron Booty  It's a booty made of iron ♪ [exclaims] ♪ Iron Booty  Gonna cage you in desire ♪ ♪ Iron Booty  Once you're in, you're never out ♪ ♪ Iron Booty ♪ ♪ Watch out! ♪ Meet your new best friend there, Nephew, the Iron Booty. Seven layers of cold rolled steel. That looks like it chafes. How do you go pee-pee in that? Iron Booty killed my cousin, man. Looks like a metal diaper. Yeah. We wanted metal jean-shorts but they were just too expensive. You're wasting your time, Uncle. Nothing can contain this booty. This booty is a force of nature. Wild. Unpredictable. Fierce. We'll see about that. Crimson! [grunting] [exclaiming in fear] Let's see you "move it, move it" now. [sobbing] My badonkadonk! I can't see it! [screaming] My heinie needs sunshine! Without sunlight, King Julien's booty is gonna die! He can't live without his booty! [crying in exasperation] I'm coming, King Julien! We're going to break you completely, Nephew. Put him in the box! [crowd gasps] [sadly] King Julien. [crying] You'll never get away with this! Clover's still out there. She'll rescue us! Hmm, not so much. I used a little inside sister knowledge to trick her into waiting for a secret admirer who not only doesn't exist, but is coming to kill her. [laughs cruelly] Right about now. [shouting] Hello? Secret admirer? I'm here! -[vulture squawking] -[screaming] [both grunting] [grunting] Sage? Hey, Clover, didn't know it was you. I don't like to put eye-holes in the mask. Keeps my skills sharp. Why are you here? Why does the shark swim forever in the moonlight? That's not an answer. Answers are just questions with different punctuation. [angrily] Why are you here, Sage? You hired me to kill somebody named Clover. What? That doesn't make any sense. I'm Clover. Why would I do that? I didn't think it was you you. I thought it was another Clover. Clover's the name society forced upon you. I only know you as the name I gave you in my mind... [speaking gibberish] So, I hired you to kill somebody named Clover, which is crazy, 'cause I-- [exclaims] Crimson! [exclaiming] That's my favorite color, too. Sage, focus. Where was I when I asked you to kill me? Right... about here. [sighing] Did I give you anything? Yeah, these sweet clams-- -She paid you in clams. -Yes. Wait a minute... I know this clam. Hm. This particular type of mollusca bivalvia heterodonta can only be found on that little atoll to the southwest. Gotcha, Crimson. You are so gonna pay for this! Mm... Oh, he is really baking in there. Yeah. Let's stick a toothpick in him and see if he's done. [whimpers] Hello, sunbeam, my only friend. Tell me a story. Oh, yeah! I love that one! Where are these lines coming from? [exclaims] Whose hand is this? Come on, Escondido! Come on! Oh, dirty tricks! Oh, dirty bug jockeys! Not bad. [laughing crazily] I am a naughty rainbow and I need a spanking! [laughing insanely] [bawling in fear] [laughing hysterically] [chuckles] Oh, yeah! He's ready! Bring him out! [whimpering] [exclaiming in pain] I promised I would break you, Nephew, and that is what I did. I made you fear me. [meekly] How... [coughs] How many years have I been in the box? Fifteen minutes. Hey, dumb-dumb? You want some more? [crying] No, Uncle, no more. I'll do whatever you want... I got my mind right. Please don't put me back in the box. How do I know that you're telling me the truth? I don't want any backsliding now. I won't slide in any direction! I got my mind right. [dance music playing] [gasps] Uh-huh. Uh-huh! I don't believe your dancing booty can resist such a badonkalicious beat. Huh? Am I right? Badonkadonk? Badonkadonk! A donka? And a donka? I sound German! You've done it. He's broken. King Julien? No! You monster! You've destroyed everything good and beautiful! [shouting] [crying] It's too hot to sleep, slave. Fan me. Whatever you wish, Uncle. Ah, it's so good to be king again, Nephew. Aren't you glad that I'm king again? Yes, Uncle. Of course, Uncle. You hear that, Uncle? That's the sound of my booty tunneling to freedom! And it's coming for you! [laughs] [whispering] Psst! Mo-Mo, wake up. But, Henrietta, I love you, baby! Maurice, wake up! Who-in-the-what-hey-who-ha? Your-- Your Majesty! You're back! Keep it down, Maurice. I have the key. [laughs] I thought they broke you. I was faking it so I could grab the key. I know my uncle. [laughs] [whispers] I mean... [laughs softly] Now, wake the peoples. We are leaving. [both exclaim] [rooster crowing] Uh-uh-uh. Where do you think you're going? Oh, right. You're not going anywhere. [laughs] With a laugh like that, no wonder I didn't want to marry her. [Clover] Clover from above! [grunting] The key! [panting] [exclaims in pain] Looks like we're right back where we started, Nephew. [laughs] I told you, you will never leave Feartopia! There's been a change of plans, Uncle! I'm not afraid of you! You can't keep me down! And you can't keep my peoples down! We're gonna grab that key and go home. Whaddya say, my peeps? [all] Yeah! Stay away from me! Stay away from me! What'cha doing here, sister girl? Thought you'd be half-past dead by now. I should be after you sent me fake love letters, hired my sort of ex-boyfriend-- well, not really, but he had really big arms so there was that but anyway-- to kill me! [both grunting] Oh, Clover fights herself. I wish I had a second me to wrestle into submission. I would hold me tight in my rippling arms. [grunting] Well placed. [exclaims] Ah, nice. [panting] Maurice! The Mort-o-rang! Whee! Yes, please! Hurl me! [grunts] Hurray! I'm a projectile! [exclaims in pain] This just in! I got it! I got it-- Update. I don't got it. Mine, mine, mine, mine, mine! No! Mine! [shouting and choking] -Mine! -Mine! -Mine! -Mine! -Mine! -Mine! -Mine! -Yours! -Okay. -Psych! How could you send someone to kill your own sister? We're family! How could you ruin your own sister's wedding! -Admit it. You were jealous. -No, I wasn't! Yes, you were. You've always been jealous of me! Well, I wouldn't have been jealous if you would have just included me! How could I? You were always off doing martial arts camp or wilderness survival training. You didn't have time for me! I would have made time! -You would have? -Of course. You're my... You're my sister. [sobbing] -[crying] -I'm sorry. -[wailing] -I'm sorry. No, I am! [all cheering] [exclaims in pain] King Julien! No! I told you, you would never leave here! I'm the king! Me! Not you! You weren't even supposed to survive the foosas when I made you king. Well, I'm gonna fix that right now, you tub of lard! Tub on this, Uncle! Todd! Hit it! [plays up-tempo music] Huh? Here comes the Underground Butt Railroad! [imitates train chugging, then whistle] Let my cheeks go! [jiggling] [moans unsteadily] [groans dazedly] And I told you! You will never break this booty! Prepare to get cheeked, Uncle! [slow motion] Booty power! Stay down. I don't want to butt slap you again, Uncle. Now, who's got the key? I swallowed it. Okay, Mort, open wide. Aah... Surprisingly roomy in here. Okay, got it. But that was kind of, uh... grody. [shudders] So I've decided you get to stay here in your Feartopia. Alone. Forever. You're welcome! Let's chat about this. Please. [shouting] No! [indistinct chattering] Wait. Where's Crimson? Oh! I saw her go off with Sage. They were totally holding hands! I think they're in love! No. No, she wouldn't. Not Sage, my almost one-time ex-boyfriend. Just sort of, almost. Anyway, typical. This is so typical. So-- [growls] [angrily] Crimson! [cawing] -[vulture squawking] -[exclaims] Any of you fellas know how to play the harmonica?
