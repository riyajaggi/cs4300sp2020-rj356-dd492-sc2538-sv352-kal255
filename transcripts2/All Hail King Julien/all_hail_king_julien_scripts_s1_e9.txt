And more importantly, why wasn't I invited? Junk, junk, bill. Todd? I don't know any Todds. Junk, junk. [groans] Fine! I know when I'm not wanted... Todd, whoever you are. But while I'm here, might as well have some cake.

 Todd won't miss it. And it's gonna go bad anyway, so... [buzzing] Shoo, fly, don't bother me. [grunting] Not the face! Not the face! [shudders] My eyes! What kind of demon bug are you? - [grunting] - [crash] Hmm? Hmm? [gasps] Stop! Drop the bat. Turn around slowly and keep your paws where I can see 'em. - [all gasp] - King Julien? Okay, I'll be the first to admit this looks pretty bad. Did King Julien do this? - He hates Todd! - [whimpers] Hold on, everybody. Let's not jump to crazy conclusions. I'm sure King Julien has an explanation for all this. He better. [chuckles] Yes, thank you, Maurice. There is, of course, an explanation, and it is... [croaks] - Gecko! - A little gecko did all this? Ha ha ha ha! Of course not. That would be so ridiculous. No, a really, really big gecko did all of this. - How big? - Huge. Like, bigger than really big... stuff. So big, you need 12 eyes to see all of it. I didn't know geckos could get that big. True, most cannot, but this one can. Because it eats lots of... uh, cake. And... lemurs! - [all gasp] - We're all gonna die! Yes, that's right. The mega-gecko... That's what I'm calling it... It's a party-pooping, lemur-cake-ivore. - A lemur-cake-ivore! - [all gasp] I've never heard of a mega-gecko. That's because no one except your brave king has lived to tell the tale. How did you get away? I fought it off with... nuts! It eats nuts, too? Don't be ridiculous, Clover. It has a... very serious nut allergy. So I just shoved these nuts in its allergic face, and it ran away. King Julien is better than everybody! [stomach rumbling] What does it look like? It has big... red eyes. And it, uh, breathes fire! It only comes out at night. But it's daytime. And during the day... sometimes, when it's really hungry. And the scariest thing of all... The mega-gecko could be hiding among us... right... now! [all chattering and screaming] King Julien, you've saved us. Uh, yes. I... saved you. I saved you all! [murmuring, sighs of relief] I heard the mega-gecko is taller than the tallest baobab and still growing. I heard the mega-gecko ate all the animals in Africa and then swam to Madagascar for dessert. I heard the mega-gecko likes to roast lemurs over fire and put them between graham crackers and chocolate! He calls them "lemores"! Well, I heard it eats our hearts to absorb our power. [Mort] King Julien, look at your poll numbers! 130%! They love you more than ever. Of course they love me. I defeated the mega-gecko. That's right, you're the one who's going to protect us from the mega-gecko. Easy, Maurice, you're hurting my arm. [Maurice stammering] Aaah! [mega-gecko snarling] [screaming] [yawns] Aah! Masikura, I'm indecent! Apologies. This could not wait. Okay, I'm decent. You were saying? We have a problem. Your subjects are convinced that there are lizard spies among them working for the mega-gecko. Spies? They're rounding up any lizard they can for questioning. These don't seem so bad. Kind of brighten the place up. There's more. Dorothy organized a nut drive. Give your nuts for victory! Hmm. Because of the mega-gecko's allergy. Again, what's the harm? Collecting nuts can be a very bonding experience. Oh? O-M-G, is it cake o'clock already? That's right, people. All cake is a security risk and must be destroyed. Destroying cake?! Has everyone lost their minds? Maurice! [Maurice] Thanks for seeing me on such short notice. It's just this mega-gecko. It's giving me powerful heebie-jeebies. I haven't been able to sleep, and when I do, I see bone-chilling things. Well, in the dream, I'm runnin', and it's chasing me and... Oh, Maurice, there you are. What are you doing here... with Amelia? I swallowed a... uh, uh, the bathroom. Nature call. Hey, that was kind of weird, right? What did you say to him? Enough about Maurice! I've got my own problems, too, okay? Everyone's gone amok in the brain! They're wasting perfectly good cake! This mega-gecko is the worst thing that's never happened to me. But-But if I tell them that I lied, they'll think I'm a liar. Yeesh, for a skeleton, you give really bad advice. You know who gives great advice? Maurice, that's who. He always knows what to say. Wait, that's it! Okay, everybody, as your leader, it is my job to facilitate two-way communication between you, my loyal subjects, and me, King Julien. So, Maurice, come on up here - and, you know, communicate. - What do you want me to say? Tell everyone that everything's okay, it's fine, they have nothing to fear. You know, you do... Do like you do. Uh, hi, everybody. Well, I guess I'll start by saying that... I've been having this nightmare that the mega-gecko is chasing me through the jungle before he finally swallows me whole, where I see all the other lemurs he's eaten. And you were there, and you, and especially you, Todd! [crying] Okay, uh, ignore everything he just said, people. Maurice was never here. Maurice who? That's a good question. Heh heh, no idea. Don't worry, King Julien. I've got this. Listen up, people. There is no reason to be afraid. There is only one thing to do now, and that is to hunt the mega-gecko! But we don't know the first thing about hunting. We are gatherers. Well, it's time to become hunter-gatherers! [cheering] Just out of curiosity, Clover, what happens if you don't find the mega-gecko? Impossible. I won't sleep, I won't eat, I'll neglect important personal relationships. Okay, uh, good. That's what I thought. - Hold on. - Timo, can you build me this? [laughs] Well, probably. Yes. But I have a few questions. I will not be taking any questions at this time. Xixi here, reporting live from the baobab tree as Clover prepares to lead a hunting party into the jungle to find and defeat the mega-gecko. Clover, can you tell us a little about your team? Well, I have gathered the best of the best. Ow! Or the best of the... very small pool of options I had available to me. Yeah. Ten-hut! We are going deep into enemy territory to find the mega-gecko! We will be cruel, we will be merciless, we will do things that we can never, ever tell our children about! Sound good? - I don't know. - I'm scared. Do we get to wear uniforms? I just love a man in uniform. [sighs] Uh, are you done yet? I'm in kind of a hurry. So, why did you want me to build you a giant mechanical gecko, set it loose at a specific place in the jungle and not tell anyone about it? Well, uh, it's... You know Todd? Sure, cute kid. Loves bunnies. I was supposed to go his party, but I became consumed with my own scent and lost track of time. [laughs, snorts] I have to remember my yearly bathing. Okay, first, gross. And second, how come everyone was invited but me? I mean, aah! Just... aah! Anyhoo, because it's Todd's birthday, I wanted to get him something, you know, special, as a surprise. Oh. Okay, done. Uh, no, no, no. The ears have to go. But I thought since Todd loves... No, the mega-gecko does not have ears. - The what? - That's what I'm calling it. I named it, and that's its name, and so... that's the name. [clattering] [whirring] Ahh, ha ha. [sniffs] Hmm. It went this way. Does anyone have to fear-tinkle? I have to fear-tinkle. Shh. [all grunt] King Julien? What are you doing out here? It's not safe. I've never been to a hunting party before. The decorations are a little sparse. It's not that kind of party. Who's watching the kingdom? I left Maurice in charge. [teeth chattering] So, just FYI, you're going the wrong way. - But the tracks go... - Trust me, Clover. I know exactly where the mega-gecko is. Call it a fifth sense. [sighs] Okay, shh, we're here. Okay, everybody, prepare yourself for something pretty hideous. And try not to make any sudden movements. Behold... the mega-gecko! Yep, that's it. Now, let's capture it, bring it home, I'll slay it and put this whole thing behind us. But, King Julien, there's nothing there. What? I told Timo to leave it here. - What? - What? - You said something. - Yeah, exactly. I say a lot of things, Clover. [humming] These tracks make no sense. Like it's going in circles. [gasps] We're not tracking it, it's tracking us! We're all gonna die! At least I can tinkle now. Oops, too late. Someone get some beavers, we need a dam for this stream. Ha ha ha ha! Ha. No one is going to die. We need a trap to catch this thing. Which means we need... - bait. - Hi. - Perfect! - Hey! I was saving that for my cheat day. - Well, that ought to do it. - Can I have my cake now? - No. - [groans] - [rustling] - [all gasp] Ha! Gotcha. [thumping and growling] [all] Huh? Hmm, I had low blood sugar. Heh heh. [sighs] All right, everyone. We're making camp for the night. Mort? You just volunteered to stand guard. [groans] [snoring] King Julien loves me. King Julien loves me a lot. King Julien loves me. King Julien loves me a lot. [snarling] [groans] Oh, no. Help! [roars] Look, I'm just saying, "hunting party" is a bit misleading. Mort? Mort? He's gone. It was the mega-gecko. And it looks like it went that way. I can't see where you are pointing, Clover, the kingdom is in the way. It's the kingdom I'm pointing at. Oh. Heh heh. Oh. Oh. We have to hurry! They're all gonna die! We should be okay, though. [thumping] No. [roars] He-e-e-e-elp! [roaring] [all screaming] - On it! - No, Clover, I've got this. Have no fear, my peoples, I will face our enemy and slay him but good. I just need to find the off switch. Yeah, there's no match for me! Aah! Ooh, it's hot. Too hot! Timo! Aah! I ordered one giant gecko, and you gave me this? There must be a glitch in the circuitry or perhaps an errant line of code. - In words I can understand. - It's gone kaflooie! In {\i1}other {\i0}words I can understand, Timo. [all screaming] - We're all gonna die! - What he said. Come on, Maurice, find your courage, man. You're better than this. Your king needs you. [grunting] I can't move! I... can... do... [grunting] [all screaming] Huh? I looked for a weapon, but all I could find was this thingamajiggy. Wow, that's really great work. - Hit it! - Take this! And also that! Furthermore, this! Shoot her. Shoot her! What am I supposed to shoot her with? Aah! Just switch it off. I, uh... Well, uh... You did build an off switch, right? Of course I built an off switch. - Then what's the problem? - The off switch was on the bunny ears. So, then we just... Ohh, you've got to be kidding me. [laughing] I know, right? Wait, the manual override! The who's-your-mama-drive? No, manual override. Here, inside the mega-gecko. It's virtually impossible to get to. Pretty cool, if I do say so myself. King Julien, it's not safe! What is that? Nothing. What did you do? Uh... nothing. He had me build him a giant mechanical gecko, which unfortunately has gone berserk and is going to destroy the kingdom unless we can turn it off. [chuckles] Sorry, I laugh when I'm nervous. And also when I'm sleepy. And sometimes... Stop! You did this? There's no time to play the blame game, Clover. I think we can all agree that if it weren't for Todd and his super top-secret birthday... How do we turn it off? Only way to access the manual override is to enter here... The bypass unilateral torque thruster. The bypass unilateral... Doesn't the initials of that spell out... Yes. "Butt". Which also happens to be my mother's maiden name. Heh heh! Your mother's maiden name was Butt? You want to stop the mega-gecko or poke fun at my mother, who just happened to be a saint? No, of course not. I'm so sorry. Please continue telling us about your... [laughing] butt. As I was saying, you get to the manual override through here and hit the button here. So, um, what you're saying is, someone has to go into... the butt? - Yes. - As king, it should be me. I can't let you do that. I'll go. Whew! For a second there, I thought you were really going to let me do it. This just in. Clover has volunteered to go into the belly of the beast to put an end to the mega-gecko menace. Clover, how does it feel to be facing almost certain death? Also, and more importantly, who are you wearing? Uh... - [roaring] - [screaming] [Maurice grunting] Ah! Tail cramp. Tail cramp! Trampoline in place. Ready for launch. Over. [screaming] Hey! Hey, over here! Okay, now what? Aaaaah! Oh, right. Run away screaming. I remember now. See? [screaming] [both panting] Where did it go? Where are you? [snarling] Hmm? Clever girl. [screaming] Clover! [roars] Timo! Come back! I still need help with your butt! Uhh! Ohh, Maurice. Oh, thank the gods. This time I really thought I was going to have to do something. Why are you lying there like a stiff pill bug? I'm paralyzed with fear. Well, un-paralyze yourself. I need you to get into the mega-gecko's butt. Kind of important. I'm sorry, King Julien. I really can't move. Huh. Then it really is up to me. [gasps] [yelling] [thunk] - Ooh. - Ohh. [echoing] I did it. I'm in. Wait, no! I'm stuck! Whoa! No, it can't all end this way. Must find a way to fight fear to save my friend. I'm coming, King Julien! [Julien grunts] Thank you, Maurice. I was impacted pretty tight. [Maurice] What's the plan? [Julien] Find the override switch and end this nightmare. - [clatter] - [Clover] Ow! - [Mort] That tickles! - [Ted] Hello, nurse! [Julien] Maurice, I don't think we're alone in here. [Clover] Of course you're not alone. Make your way to my voice. I'm standing on the override, but I can't reach it. [Julien] Hold on. Almost. [powering down] - [Clover] Whoo-hoo! Yes! - [Maurice] You did it, King Julien! [Julien] What's happening? - [all screaming] - [Mort] I'm puking! [Julien] Quick, hand me that harpoon thingy! We're all gonna live! [cheering] [music playing] [croaks] Now, {\i1}this {\i0}is a party. [laughs] Hey, bud, just want to say thanks for, you know, un-stuffing me from the mega-gecko's butt. Gotta admit, pretty brave overcoming your fear like that. Thank you, Your Majesty. I'm just glad that thing is gone for good. [snarls] [music playing]
