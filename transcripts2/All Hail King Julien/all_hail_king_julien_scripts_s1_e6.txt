Ladies love that hint of danger. [growls] But that doesn't mean I'm not right. So you're, what, suspending me? No! We're just asking you to take a few days off. Yeah, you've been a scary stress-monster who's totally cramping the king's royal style. I haven't got a clue what you mean. Well, off the tippity-top of my head...

 He's got a knife! Ow! Owww! Owww! Uhh! King Julien, you've got to taste this. It'll blow your mind! He's got a bomb! It's a beverage! [thud] Oh. I spilled it. No telling now what he's got! - Your Majesty, you're safe. I admit I may have misjudged a few situations recently, but you know what they say, you can't make an omelet without breaking a few arms. Nobody says that. - Maybe they should. - Maurice is right. You can't run around like a footless chicken. Headless chicken, Your Majesty. Uh, no. How's a chicken supposed to run around without a head? How's it run around without feet? I'm not a chicken, Maurice! Why are you asking me all these questions? Oh, I hate it when Mommy and Daddy fight! - [crash] - Waaah! Clover, you need a vacation. Vacation?! Ohh. Where are we going? What do I need to pack? Where'd you come from? Someone mentions vacation, I'm there. Same goes for when a celebrity adopts an exotic baby. Sheesh. Great timing. Clover's a ticking timebomb that needs a vacation, and you are just the toucan to show her the best time ever. Your Majesty, the last thing I need is a holiday. La-la-la-la! This means I can't hear you because I'm out of good responses! Xixi, help Clover get to Cove Park. - I don't... - I'm making it a law right now! Clover has to take a vacation. All in favor? Aye! Aye! Aye! Oh, me, too! Hey, great law, King Julien! Boom! And that is how a bill becomes a law. It's a joy to watch you work! Yeah, that reminds me, take Mort. Me? But I will miss you the most! - [grunts] - Aah! Vacation emergency! This is not a drill, move it! [sighs] I thought I'd never get rid of them. You know, I think a vacation might really do Clover some good. Maurice, you're so blind to the back door of politics. That vacation wasn't for her, it was for me. - Say what, now? - I needed a break. She won't stop following me around. She's following you around because it's her job to keep you safe. Now {\i1}you {\i0}sound like Clover. Is she working you like some sort of puppet? - What are you doing? - Never mind. I want to see how Clover accesses your puppet mouth. Oh, come on. Stop it. No, {\i1}you {\i0}come on and stop it. I'm perfectly capable of taking care of myself. If you'll excuse me, I'm headed to the Cove of Wonders to find things that are explode-able! For your own safety, Your Majesty, the assistant captain of the Ringtailed Guard will be watching you. Reporting for duty, sir! Has anybody seen my spear? Shoot, I feel like I just had it. [cheering] Oh, this is the life, huh, Clover? If it's all the same to you, if I can't be working, I'd rather focus on my writing and not spend too much time doing... whatever all this is. - Well, whatcha writing? - It's nothing. Ooh, come on, let me see. Ha ha! Got it! Oh, no! Uhh! Back off, or it's going in the ocean. Fine. Truce. [Xixi] Ooh! Who's this fella? Oh, he's very muscley. - [mutters] Norj Grendelfist. - Who? Norj Grendelfist, okay? He's the one true love of Thysander Plunderhorse, the heroine of my series of self-published fantasy novels. He's a brave warrior, strong and... - [blows whistle] - Hey, everybody! Limbo contest is starting at 0-now-hundred hours! - [blows whistle] - Get that whistle away from me before I feed it do you. [gulps] Sorry. Just trying to make sure everyone has a good time. What do you think? Should we see how low we can go? I want to go so low, I hit rock bottom. Yay! Oh, that's the spirit, Mort! Come on, Clover! Hmm? That looks dangerous. Really dangerous! Maybe this holiday won't be a waste after all. [Julien] Let's get one thing straight, substitute Clover. You can't tame this wild stallion, and you can't tell this wild stallion what to do, because I speak a strange horse language that even {\i1}I {\i0}don't know. [neighs, snorts] What did I just say? No idea. Heck, Your Majesty, I wouldn't boss you around even if I did speak horse. Permission to offer refreshments, sir! Homemade smoothies, yum! [gulping] This delicious smoothie changes nothing, by the way. Ooh! Is that ginger I'm tasting? To give it a little zing. Ah, so that's your angle. Get me hooked on your tantalizing smoothies, and then do mind control on my brainy parts! Ha! Nice try. I should tidy up before the stain sets. You're cleaning up my mess? Clover never does that. Well, there's a new sheriff in town, and he is declaring marshal law on all spills, whoopsies and uh-ohs. All right. Well... I'm going out for a bit. Laters. - Have fun. - Okay. Uh, don't you want to stop me? I can be quite dangerous... unattended. I trust you. I'm just here to make sure everything runs smoothly. Or should I say "smoothie-ly"? Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha! Oh, holy cannoli! Did you just make that up? It's my nutty sense of humor, I guess. You're telling me you're gonna let me do whatever I want? Suresies! I'm just tickled to be so close to a real live king. I want to do whatever makes you happy. Really? Well, if you want to hang with a real live king, you could tag along. - [chuckling] - From a safe distance. Mmm. Ha ha! Clover would never let me eat this much. I'm just glad this is my cheat day. You sure about this, Your Majesty? Just do it before I lose my nerve. Aah! Oh, fumble-rooskies! I've killed the king! Ha ha ha ha! That was pretty epic! Ha ha ha ha! Now let me do you. Ohh! Hmm. I've always wondered what was under those rocks. Let's go. [grunting] [straining] [sighs] Nothing. Mystery solved. [both screaming] I can't believe you let me do that! Best captain of the Ringtailed Guard ever! But seriously, that was a little dangerous, buddy. I know. My heart is going like a hummingbird. Here, feel it. Hmm. Hyah! You're... a lemur. Technically. But I'm not big on labels. We're all children of the universe. [grunting and shouting] If I let you loose, are you gonna punch and kick me? [groans] Not immediately. But I cannot guarantee I won't feel the urge to later. Norj? What? Is it my hair? Pretty great, right? I use a leave-in conditioner I make myself from fire ant larvae. You, uh, remind me of... someone. Well, whoever that is, he must be pretty special. By the way, my name is... [shouting gibberish and barking] But you can call me Sage Moondancer. What are you doing out here? Just grabbing a fistful of this world. Same as you. [sighs] Are you alone? Do you have dreams? That's not even remotely an answer to what I asked you, so, um... I disagree. You're never alone when your dreams grab your reality in a headlock and say, "You let me down, brother." Eyes open, goddess. The future you is painting a final goodbye on a cloudy bathroom mirror in a hotel owned by the past. So, are you a local or what? Uh... I was on this dreadful vacation. Everyone was happy and relaxed and playing games. It was a nightmare. Vacation is a tool the ruling class uses to enslave us. I don't think I've ever met anyone like you. I have. My reflection played out a million times on the dew of a leaf, a leaf attached to a tree I planted with these paws. A closed circle. Your friends are probably wondering where you are. - [all cheering] - Limbo! Oh, yeah, get it, Mort! Spring break, yo! Whaa! I'm sure they haven't even noticed I'm gone. Perhaps you could, uh, show me around? On it. That's my favorite phrase. Mine, too. Oh. Right there on the, uh... On the lower back. Heh. Forever. Okay. Wow, I've never seen this watering hole before. Clover had it declared off limits. Something about it being dangerous, I don't know. She's such a worry-pants. [snarling] Foosa! Right, that's what she said. What do we do?! You're here to protect me, remember? Just take them out! You're totally gangster, Ted. Way tougher than Clover. Really?! No, seriously, really? I don't know. Stuff comes out of my mouth, no idea how it got there. We gotta do something, or one of us... You... is gonna get eaten. So use your training. Oh, yeah. My training. Okay, Ted, come on, see if you can hit me. Charge! Ay! Hey, you big jerks. You need to get the "H" out of here! I'm the captain of the Ringtailed Guard, and now you... You're just so... Shoo! Get out of here, you bullies! - Clover gone? - No Clover? That's right. There is nothing standing between you and every tasty lemur haunch in the village but me! Yeah! Wait, what? You nasty boys. Charge! Ohh, goodness! I was afraid I was gonna tinkle. Oh, turns out I did tinkle a little bit. Sorry. [groans] No more Clover? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Foosa attack! [snarling] Spring break! See how much better this is than that dumb book, Clover? Oh, yeah! Spring break! [Mort] Spring break! [gulping] Brilliant. Really hits the spot when you're tired of drinking your own pee. Your life is absolutely fascinating. A strong, rugged survivalist fighting against the elements, killing your own food. Yeah. Actually, um, the Moondancer's not really into the whole... hitting and killing thing. But the way you fight... My sensei once taught me aggression is a boil on the fishmonger's nose. But through nonviolence the cobbler becomes a trout. What if your life is in danger? Danger is a house built with fear-wood and worry-nails. Would you mind doing that... heroic standing thing again? The thing with the hair? How's this? [sighs] That's better. And if you could, I don't know, just talk a lot less. No problemo. I once took a vow of silence that lasted three years. I broke it when I got into a shouting match with a fern. - [growls] - What's wrong? Nothing. Just, um, a bit of reality sinking in. [hissing] Oh, quick! Protect me, Norj! - Who's Norj? - Sage! I said Sage! Aah! [hissing and screeching] [hissing] [shouting] You almost got us killed. Huh! Oh... hello, guv'nor. I am so sorry that snake forced you to lash out in anger. Quite all right. You're a strong one, aren't you? Did it become incredibly warm all of a sudden? Hmm. Hmm? Ha ha ha! This is darling! Look how he drew you! It's funny because you don't expect to see a king in a bikini. Heh. Yeah. So much fun. I'll be right back. You gotta save me, man! Ted is the worst! It was a mistake for you to send Clover away! {\i1}You {\i0}sent Clover away. I thought you liked Ted. What happened? I remembered how freaky dangerous I am when I don't have Clover to remind me how freaky dangerous I am! I need a firm hand, Maurice. And Ted's hand is so... soft. It's like French cheese or something. Okay, I get it. Lucky for you, Clover should be back tomorrow. Good. Because I saw some foosa lurking around - and Ted maybe told them Clover was gone. - He what?! I want to know everything about me. You. Tell me your secrets, your hopes and dreams. You've been talking to that butterfly for almost an hour. I know. He has so much to teach me. Thank you, friend. Your wisdom is a gift. So, anyway, while you were communing with a butterfly, I found something. These look like fresh foosa tracks, right? [sniffs, slurps] Ugh. Yeah. Why? They're headed for my village. Cool. Company. Not cool. If the foosa attack and I'm not there, the kingdom could be in real danger. Oh, there's that word again. - Danger? - No. Real. It's such a trap. We're all just ventriloquist dummies and fate is a cruel puppet master sticking his unwashed hand up our... What is wrong with you?! You're supposed to be brave and heroic and virile and attentive and romantic and everything I wrote in my stories! Look at your abs! You don't deserve to have those abs! The Moon-dizzle just believes violence never solved anything. Maybe not, but it sure does feel good. [groaning] Where am I? [gasps] Xixi! Wake up! Wake up! Stay with me! Don't go into the light! No-o-o-o-o! Spring break! Spring break! Oh, yeah! We're never gonna die! [sighs] This place is beat. We should get home. Hey, Clover, you ready? Clover? Uh-oh. Interim assistant captain of the Ringtailed Guard coming through. Oh, why the frowny faces? Did you tell the foosa Clover was gone? Hmm? I... Oh, my. Is this... Are you firing me? [wailing] - Uh... - Nice. What? But you told me... But-but-but... As my advisor, I had hoped you'd handle this more professionally. Put your arms around him or something. He's getting First Class all wet. There, there, Ted. Nothing personal. I just wanted to do a good job! [sobbing] You smell really good. [wailing] - We got a... - Aaaaaaah! - [thud] - We got a problem. We lost Clover. Relax. As long as the foosa don't use the information Ted gave them about Clover being away to plan a full-scale attack, we have nothing to worry about. [screaming] Okay, nobody panic. It sounds like it could be the foosa, but we don't know yet. Yeah, it's the foosa. Ted, you're re-hired. I, unlike Maurice, always believed in you. Oh, boy. Come on! Lemur up, Ted! Oh, thank you for the second chance, King Julien. Yeah. [inhaling] All right. Here I go. Maybe if we wait a bit, they'll tire themselves out. They look kind of sleepy. [screaming] Ted, the kingdom is counting on you. If you don't go out and fight, we're all doomed. Me, you, everyone. Me again. And also, me! Well, sounds like everything's under control. So, uh, I'm just gonna... I think I can get the drop on them and use the element of surprise. [grunting] On it! Hyah! Oh, thank goodness. I thought for a minute there... Oops, too late. Tinkle again. [snarling] - Sage? - I felt bad about the way we left things. So not {\i1}muy bien{\i0} on my part. I said some pretty harsh stuff. Hyah! I didn't mean it. [grunting] And I'm here breaking my vow of nonviolence for you. [shouting] Could we maybe... Hyah... Discuss this later? [grunting] [Sage] Join me. Yaaay! We did it! Probably should've cleaned up the tinkle before I hugged you. I'll go do that now. I'm really not the type of guy to say I told you so, but... I told you so! Hope you learned your lesson about begging the king to let you go on vacation. It was your idea to... I mean... yes, Your Majesty. And also... there's no easy way to say this, but... you're pretty okay at your job and you were missed. That actually seemed pretty easy. But my point is... it's no fun to do fun stuff when there's nobody trying to stop you. And, Clover, you make it almost impossible to have fun. Um... thanks? And, uh, who's the man candy? The name is... [shouting gibberish and barking] Cool, I can remember that. Thanks for saving the kingdom. I don't know what we would've done if you two hadn't showed up. Probably just a lot of... Ah! A foosa's eating my face off! Why would Clover abandon her lemur family? [wailing] Why?! And then the... [wailing] Something like that. [laughs] Totally. You should stay and hang out with us. We have an unreasonable amount of trampolines. I just came to give Clover a proper goodbye. I spoke to her in anger earlier. It was totally not Moondancer. Oh, you really didn't have to... - Okay. - Huh? So, am I supposed to, uh... Shh. There. We have closure. [whistles] [squawks] Hmm. What was that? Hopefully, my last vacation for a very, very long time. [squawks] [music playing]
