King Julien, we have a problem with the royal to-do list. What kind of problem, Maurice? Ah, I see, yes. There does appear to be a lot of "do" unattended to. Crime is up, housing is a mess, royal proclamations are unsigned... Okay, I get it. You're behind on your duties.

 I forgive you. They're {\i1}your {\i0}duties! - Ha ha ha! - Whee! Hello. Why is Mort tied to the end of your fishing line? Why, you ask? Because of this. Yeah? So? So? Did you not see the words "king"... Of which I am... And "magic"... of which I want? King Julien, can I take a break? This squeezy rope is making my inside parts feel all poppy. Are you holding my magic sack? Um... no. Aah! Tell me this isn't more important than a lot of king chores. Aaaah! I got it, King Julien! I... - Mort! - My sack! I'm okay. I was only partially digested. What... Huh? Hmm. That doesn't look like magic. Looks like beans. Clearly, Maurice, these are magical beans. The sea gods have bestowed them upon me. Your Majesty! [chuckling] Quiet. Something is happening. Oh. [coughing] Ah! I'm choking! The magic doesn't seem to be working. King Julien, look at this. What is it? I'm frightened by what I don't understand. Of course. The magic must be locked inside the beans, and this tool is the magic juicer. But we don't have anything that looks like that. No. But I know someone who might. Timo, I need your science-y help. I require a tool for my beans. - Huh? - It's his show, baby. I'm just a co-star. Ha ha ha ha! Okay, the instructions on the bag were vague, and by vague, I mean nonexistent. [laughs, snorts] But, uh, this should work. Or it will explode, killing us all. I'm willing to take that chance. [bubbling, hissing] Ooh, listen to the magic screaming with joy at its release. I wonder what powers it will give me. Flight? Superior thigh strength? Hmm. Ah, yes. Ahh. Aah! The royal tongue is on fire! Here, here, here. I'm blind! That's better. King Julien, how do you feel? I feel... nothing! Timo, what's wrong with your machine? Might need an adjustment to get the mixture right. More or less. I heard the word "more". [gargling] Aah, that burns! Here we go. Come on, magic. Show the king some love. Doesn't have to be a lot of love. A limp handshake would be fine. [sobbing] The gods are mocking me, Maurice! Let's give the king a few minutes. I hate it when King Julien is sad. It makes me so... [sobbing] Don't start crying, or I'm gonna start... [sobbing] Really? Come on, guys, this is not what King Julien needs. King Julien? He's left! [laughing hysterically] This is amazing. Feels like there's a dance party of Juliens powering my brain! [echoes] Oh, even my echoes are better. We know you stole the boombox, Willy. Give it up, you're surrounded. [Willy] What? I'm not even in here. - He's bluffing. - You think? [Julien laughing] [Willy] Hey, hey! Stop it! Aah! Rampant crime, check. Welcome to the new secret headquarters of the Lemur Alliance Liberation Army. You know, I like it. But where's the rest of it? [laughing] Housing shortage, check. Ha ha ha! - He knows! - Evasive maneuvers! [alarm blaring] How could you let him drink it? It was Julien and magic beans. What was I supposed to do? Clover, Maurice, there you are. Your Majesty, we've been looking all over for you. Are you... reading? Yes, I have read the entire history of our kingdom. We are so messed up! King Julien, have you slept? Nope. It's amazing what you can accomplish without sleep. Ha ha ha! All the "dos" are "dones" now, Maurice. And with the free time left over, I had time to start work on something called a rock opera. Check it. [music playing] That's the act one outro. I call it {\i1}Musings {\i0}o{\i1}f a Sad Pineapple.. King Julien, this is... incredible! No, Maurice. It's coffee. It's brought out the truly kingly potential buried underneath my Julien layer parts. I have been peeled. If that's true, where can I get a cup? This kingdom would be crime-free in a day if I didn't have to sleep. Clover, you psychotic genius! I'm having an ide-e-e-a! [playing music] I have an announcement. King Julien is dead! [all shriek] Zombie! [sighs] I'm not a zombie! It's a metaphor, people, look it up. - Huh? - I'm still me, but improved. Imagine a me sandwich stuffed with me. That's a pretty good sandwich, right? I'd eat you, King Julien. Yummy. Hmm. Now, what if I told you I had a drink that could improve you all the same way? That sounds pretty far-fetched to me. Where did this drink come from? Magic beans the gods left me in the ocean. Oh, okay, I buy that. Uh, uh, what do you call it? I call it Brown Julien. Who's first? [all stammering] Clover! Thanks for volunteering. What? [blows] Mmm. Burns! I like it. How do you feel? Wait, before you answer, drink five more cups. Just five. Yes, go ahead. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. Oh, yeah, baby! Lift-off! [screaming] [all clamoring] Ahhh... Soon the kingdom will be super-charged on coffee. With no need for sleep, imagine what we will accomplish! I'm still a little unclear on the "no sleep is a good thing" theory. That's because your tiny brain is not yet Brown Julien-ized. Drink up. Uh... Yechh! Tastes like foosa burps. Wonder how long it takes before... [grunting] [sobbing] Mort, what's wrong? Isn't it obvious? I have a drinking problem! Aww, that's because you're chewing instead of swallowing. Oh. Mmm! It's a miracle. Brown Julien has cured my drinking problem! [sighs] In 24 hours, this kingdom will be unstoppable. Without sleep, we will pick more fruit, build more huts, dodge more foosa, and still have time left to... Wait for it. - [music playing] - Party-y-y-y-y! [laughing] Whoo! All I'm saying is we should increase security. The way Brown Julien affects people is unpredictable. It nearly vibrated my fur off. Cowboy up, Maurice. Brown Julien has opened my eyes. It's like I can see the jungle behind the jungle. You understand? I understand you're scaring me. [music slows and grows distorted] All I'm saying, Masikura, is someone pulling the strings? Am I even talking right now? Or is someone moving my tongue for me? Ahh. Oh, that's a bug. [music slows and grows more distorted] Hey! Ha ha! [grunting] Aah! Refill before it's too late! Give us your cup! See if he's got any more in his pockets! Lemurs don't have pockets, you bumpkin! I'll check anyway. Get him! Get him! I knew it, I knew it, I knew it! Fact: Super-intelligent foosa are trying to control us from the center of the planet. Fact: King Julien might already be corrupted... Aah! Hey! Time to quit the conspiracy theories and start doing your job. A conspiracy theory is just truth without facts. All I'm sayin'. Please tell me we're almost out of beans. - Just poured my last cup. - What?! We're out of... Unless you want a bunch of Brown Julien-crazed lemurs tearing this place apart, let's keep that on the down-low for now, you dig? King Julien? [groaning] Your Majesty! [mumbling] [British accent] King Julien will be fine. Huh? - [Maurice] Mort? - [Clover] Mort? Sorry for startling you. As you know, coffee's effects vary. In my case, It made me incredibly intelligent and gave me a smashing accent. Okay, Maurice, you've convinced me. Coffee must be stopped. If coffee's what King Julien needs, we have a problem. The kingdom is officially out! What? What?! Ohh! Why do I have a splitting headache? That's from lack of coffee. It's depleting your cerebral blood flow. Your brain is drying out. I can't run a kingdom with a dried brain. I need more coffee! How can we be out of Brown Julien?! Your Majesty, please keep it down before... Out of Brown Julien? They're trying to keep the god juice for themselves! I say tear the kingdom apart! [all growling] [Karl] Please... everything is going to be all right. [gasps] It can't be. There's no need for violence. Not yet, at least. Hello, Karl. King Julien, you remember me. One should remember his arch-nemesis. Oh, is that what you are? I thought you were the guy who failed to defeat me once with his evil genius plan. That's an arch-nemesis. Huh? Enough mind warfare! Why are you here? To defeat you, of course. And this time, my plan is working perfectly. What plan? To bring the lemur kingdom to its knees. No! Using a simple cup of coffee. Since our last encounter, I've had Chauncey {\i1}watching your every move.{\i0} {\i1}I discovered you were fond {\i0}o{\i1}f taking breaks{\i0} {\i1}to gather{\i0} {\i1}your brilliant thoughts, {\i0} {\i1}at your Cove of Wonders.{\i0}. Uh... yes, that {\i1}is {\i0}what I do there. [Karl] {\i1}Once I knew where you'd be, {\i0} {\i1}I spent months training {\i0}c{\i1}rocodiles to carry coffee{\i0} {\i1}along an underwater rail {\i0}s{\i1}ystem to your cove.{\i0} {\i1}I knew the moment you saw {\i0}t{\i1}he word "king", {\i0} {\i1}you would take the bait.{\i0}. Pretty elaborate plan, Karl. Unfortunately, it doesn't make any sense. I hope. Oh, but it does! Your kingdom is now in the grips of horrible coffee cravings. They need coffee, coffee which I have. Drink up, suckers! [groaning] Ah! [kissing] What do you want? The removal of Julien as king of the lemurs. In exchange, I will make sure this kingdom has all the Brown Julien it needs. How does that sound, Julien? - Julien? - [snoring] I'm conscious. Sorry, Karl. But you're a two-time evil-plan failer. Because there's no way my adoring people will choose Brown Julien over the real thing. Right, people? Hmm... [all screaming] They cast me out? Over coffee?! That's the last time I share. Thank you, guys, for standing by me. We weren't actually stand... Of course, Your Majesty. Smart Mort? You, too? I'll always love you, King Julien, no matter how intelligent I am. Oh, hey, thanks, Smart Mort. I don't know what it is, but I find your British accent very soothing. He has the same accent as me. You have an accent? I believe I have something that will make you all feel better. - Brown Julien?! - I stole grounds out of the trash, and made one last batch. It's got a kind of mushroomy, old-feet infusion that's not bad. Whoa, yeah, that's the feeling! [slurps] Take me to the moon, mama! Oh, zing-a-ding-ding! There must be a way to get the kingdom back. There is. Find Karl's supply of beans. You've faced him before. Julien, what do you remember? [snoring] Poo coffee! Uh... that's what I remember. Karl liked showing up in my bed and whining about his family's poo coffee business. That's it! That's where he's getting his supply! From my bed? It's only a twin, Maurice. No, from his family's poo coffee business. And there's only one part of the island where you could grow enough beans to supply a kingdom. - [all gasp] - Whoa! [Mort] Karl's poo coffee fields. Look who's working them. Giant jumping rats. Semi-intelligent, vicious, loyal. I've been semi-intelligent before. I'll handle them. Look over there! Karl's lair! Okay, let's take a knee. Okay, our mission is clear. [snoring] Huh, what? To reclaim my throne, we must destroy. Karl's coffee stranglehold on my kingdom and replace it with my own coffee stranglehold on my kingdom. Or we could just stop drinking coffee. Last of the Brown Julien. It will hopefully get us through this fight. This is where I leave you, my friends. Good luck to us all. In the end, he was the best of us all. Right, King Julien? [sucking] [groaning] Come on! What? Sorry, I wasn't listening. I was trying to suck the last, you know, moisture from the coffee grounds... like you do. Look at this fine morsel here. Let's eat him and make a wind chime with his bones. Hmm, you could. But before you consume me, I'm curious... Are you happy with your healthcare benefits? Huh? Why? Ugh. This is a ten-pin lock. Could take me hours to get through it. That's okay. I have a plan. - [banging on door] - Who is it?! [Julien mumbling] Special delivery for Karl! - That's your plan? - Shh. I've got orders! "No open the door unless it's an emergency." [Julien] Oh, okay. Uh, emergency! - That's better. - Hyah! [Clover] Hmm, place looks deserted. [Karl] Not completely. Did you really think my brilliant criminal brain couldn't predict your brilliant king brain would go after my fields? - Uh... maybe? - Hmm? [all grunting] - Hmm. - [yelling] I hope you're applauding your own downfall, Karl. 'Cause that's what's happening here. You're falling down! Did you really think I wouldn't have a backup plan? Can I use another "maybe"? [Karl] It's over... former King Julien. Despite your genius, you've never been able to take care of your people. So now I will. And no falling balloon is going to save you this... Uhh! Chauncey! - Speak to me! - [chattering] Who? What is this? This, dear boy, is the United Bean Workers of Madagascar. And they are officially on strike. We want a working wage! Whatever that is. And a retirement plan that doesn't involve being tied up in a sack and drowned in the ocean. - Mm-hmm. - Hold on! If they're getting paid, we should get paid, too. Enough of this! Get back to work. I can offer you more money, a competitive rate and stock options. All I ask is that you help me take out the trash. [all mumbling] - Well done, Your Majesty. - Thank you, Maurice. Where's Smart Mort? He was right behind us? He couldn't have gone far. [Karl] No. Not far at all. I'm sorry, my friends. As the Brown Julien began to wear off, I found myself getting distracted by a single thought. Feet! I'm not even sure what that's about. Oh, I know what it's about. But... the jumping rats. How? Please. A rat doesn't know what a stock option is. I promised them something they could understand. Free bagel Fridays every other month. Now, step back so I can incinerate your king. [all gasp] Ow! Now, King Julien! The weapon! Put it down, or I'll end him. - [groans] - King Julien... you know what you have to do. [normal voice] No! I love you, King Julien. [British accent] Don't listen to me. Take the shot. [stammering] [chuckles] [powering up] Good-bye, Smart Mort. No! My parents' poo coffee fields! When my brother Bruce gets back from vacation, he's gonna kill me! Smart Mort! Wait. If the coffee is gone, that means... well, you'll be Stupid Mort again. I've been stupid before. [normal voice] Fruit hat! You made the right decision, Your Majesty, for Mort and the kingdom. We'll be fine without coffee. Yeah, tell that to my splitting headache and my desperate need for a scone. Well, Karl, it appears your evil plan has failed... again. Yes, you are indeed a brilliant and worthy opponent. Fortunately, there will always be other evil plans. Oh, by the way, that weapon takes several minutes to recharge. Did you think I wouldn't have a backup plan for my backup plan?! This isn't over, Julien! Not yet, at least! Uhh! Feet! [Julien] I miss Smart Mort already. [Mort laughing] [music playing]
