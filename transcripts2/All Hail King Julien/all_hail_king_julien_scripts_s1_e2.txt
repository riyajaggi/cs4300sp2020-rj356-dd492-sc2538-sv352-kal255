 Presenting Your Royal Highness, our illustrious King Julien XIII, who drove away the foosa and... Do I really have to say this? Yes, you do really have to say this! Taught us how to dance like no one's watching and love like we've never been hurt, et cetera, et cetera. - Hurray, everybody! - [all cheering] Delta Echo Foxtrot. Perimeter's clear. Booty-quake is taking the stage. Repeat: Booty-quake is on the move. Over. - Who are you talking to? - That's classified. You don't even have a radio... [yelling] Roger that, we've got a troublemaker causing a disturbance. Bringing him in. Over.

 [cheering continues] Yay! [cheering] Listen to all the hand-clapping! This is all I ever wanted: To be adored by everybody. People do seem to be digging their new king. Thank you, thank you. I, your king, have decided that in order to keep you all safe, we need a really great navy. I present to you, our fleet! [buzzing] I call her Old Porcelainsides. Uh, she's a her because apparently all boats are girls for some reason. [crowd cheering] I love you, I love you, I love you! [mimicking drumroll] I hereby christen you, Old Porcelainsides! - [bottle vibrating] - [Julien exclaims] Put your paws together for the captain of this fine vessel, Willie! [cheering] [Maurice] Come on, let's go. Uh... are we sure this ship is seaworthy? Well, it's pee-worthy. Believe it or not, that was my next question. [yelps] [hollering] [whimpering] Yes, being king is so easy. I don't know why everybody doesn't do it. Well, it's not all fun and games. You have responsibilities now. [giggling] "Responsibilities." Good one, Maurice! [laughing] [laughing] Good one! That's a good one! I love it! - Why are we laughing? - I'm serious. You're supposed to be catching up on current events right now. Current events? [music playing] Good afternoon. As always, I'm Xixi, and this is your news. Mango lovers across the island rejoice. The recent rainfall should mean a great mango harvest this season. Come on, give me the good stuff. - Moving on to local gossip. - Finally! Sources saw Pancho looking cozy as he canoodled with a new mystery lady. - Is love in the air? - I sure hope so! - Pancho needs it! - [chuckling] And in politics, the latest polling numbers find King Julien's popularity soaring. Ooh, "soaring" is a goodly thing for my popularity to be doing. I loved him first and I love him forever-ever-ever-ever! [continues, muffled] [crashing] In a recent survey, over 99 percent of the public approve of the job the new king is doing. Huh? Hey, that's great! The big nine-nine! Up top, both hands! Don't leave a lemur hanging. [chuckles] Turn it off! Turn it off! - Wait, what did I say? - Yeah, what's wrong? [moaning loudly] Do you not see, Maurice? This glass is not half full, it is one percent empty. Ninety-nine percent full is actually a lot better than half. Eh-eh, your so-called "numbers" and "reason" and "understanding of math" are of no comfort when there are lemurs who do not like me. Lemur. As far as I can tell, there's only one. You hear that? Just one. Big deal. Everybody else likes you! [Clover] You're the king. Just make it illegal not to like you. And I will happily enforce that law. I can't wait to see the fear in their eyes as they lie about how great they think you are. Ooh, I can make a law like that? No. Well, I guess, yeah. But you shouldn't. Everybody... and, again, by "everybody" I mean one lemur... Will come around eventually. Unless the one holdout recruits more lemurs to his side. This could be the start of a revolution. Think about it. - The gnashing teeth. The blind rage. - [yelling] We need to stamp this thing out now! [panting] How long was I out? I didn't hurt anyone, did I? Yeah, instead of worrying about one disgruntled citizen, why not focus on all the stuff you do have: A great kingdom, and an abundant supply of food... Me! Hey! Like I was saying, you got a lot going for you. And don't forget that great new ship. [Willie screams] I'm sinking. Oh, no! Sharks! Oh, oh! Wait, they're... they're just dolphins! - [dolphins chittering] - [Willie screams] Really aggressive dolphins! [groans] This is literally the worst thing of all time that has happened to me ever. Oh, I would've assumed it was having half your family eaten by the foosa. Ha-ha! Good one, Xixi. But we all know they were sent away to a farm. [clearing throat loudly] Yeah. Hey, I've got something that'll make you feel better. - Check it out. - Oh, fruit on a stick! I feel so much better, Maurice! It's a visual aid I put together. I call it the "Kumquat-ometer." The pole is the kingdom, and these kumquats are all the citizens who like you and the job you're doing. See? Filled all the way to the top. No. It is short the one kumquat who does not like me. If I truly have a hater, you have to tell me who it is. Please! Before you were the most trusted toucan in news, you were my most trusted toucan in friendship. Oh, yes, we do go pretty far back. Which is all the more reason for you to do what I want you to do instead of what you think is right. Oh, I'm sorry but I've gotta protect my sources. If they don't trust me, the info pipeline's all dried up. Yes, there's no reason for me to be worked up or to make a big, huge, giant deal about this. - Masikura! - Yes, Your Majesty? Use your lizard psychic tongue to get inside Xixi's mind - and tell me what's inside it! - Oh, no, I couldn't. There are nine kinds of ethical... [shrieks] [yelping] Please stop, please stop! Please don't! [gibbering] Grape jelly, a funnel, a pair of women's shoes? - What did I just see? - It was Spring Break, OK? [Xixi yelling] [grunting] Come on. Come on, come on. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on! No can do. Sorry. I'll be in touch. King Julien, you're safe... for now. - May I have a word with you? - Eh? I've begun doing a little recon, and just as I feared, we're looking at a real security issue. [Maurice] Oh, come on! Because of one unhappy lemur? This is a private intelligence briefing. This thing's not soundproof. How private can it be? He's gonna tell me everything later anyway. True dat. I'm really bad at keeping secrets. As I was saying, it starts as one. But one bad mango can poison the entire kingdom. That's a big, bad mango. Pretty soon, you're losing support left and right and looking at a full-scale bloody uprising. Best-case scenario. That's the best-case scenario? What's the worst? You don't want to know. Trust me. That's why I need to interrogate every lemur in the kingdom. Interrogating everyone will cause a panic. Back me up, King Julien. You're doing eenie, meenie, miney, mo in your head, aren't you? Mo! I mean, no. But if I were, I would have landed on Clover. You may go investigate to see if anyone wants to uprise all over me. On it! [Yelling] You really believe there's an uprising? Couldn't hurt to be safe. Super embarrassing to get assassinated my first week on the job. In the meantime, we should get a small group of average lemurs and ask them what they think. That's... actually not an awful idea. And I get to wear a disguise! Now it's awful. First off, thank you all for coming. [chuckles] I'm gonna jump right in. Now, if you could improve one thing about the kingdom, what would it be, specifically? You, sir. Well, if I had to pick one specific thing, I'd probably say... nothing. Hey, that's great! How many people are happy overall with how the new king's been doing so far? Hard to do worse than the last few idiots. OK, Hector, I'll go on ahead and put you down for "happy." [laughing] Oy vey. [disguising voice] Hello, hello. Sorry I'm late. Uh, traffic was a nightmare. Uh, what are we talking about? Our favorite things about King Julien? OK! Uh, let's go around the room and, uh... spitball. Uh, there are no wrong answers. I can't be the only one who notices this is just King Julien with a bad fake moustache. What? I wish I was King Julien! I'm just an average everyday lemur, whose name is... Chair... Lemur... Table. Yep, Chair Lemur-table. That's me. Nope, we're not doing this. Wait, nobody wants to stay and, uh, chew the fat with Chair Lemur-table? - [groans] - It's me, Maurice! [laughing] This is not my real moustache! Wow, I can't believe my eyes. So I think that went pretty great. Really? We didn't get past the first question. Yes, but don't you see? The one-percenter, the one we've been looking for, it's Hector! Hmm. He does seem to hate pretty much everything and everyone. Now all I have to do is convince a lemur who hates everything that he likes me. It almost seems too easy. The truth is out there! And when I find it, I'm gonna make it beg for mercy! - Knock, knock! - [Hector yelling] Oh! Who's there? It's me, King Julien! What is it now? Getting right down to business. Nice. I wanted to stop by and say it was great seeing you earlier, buddy. Two friends like us should check in on each other, make sure we're having a good day and that we both like me a lot. Day's fine. See you. Oh, Hector, I love the way we joke with each other. Always with the fun times and the laughing. Ha-ha-ha-ha! Oh, see? I'm doing it right now. - Doesn't that feel good? - Nope. You have a lovely place. - What is this you're building? - My masterpiece. It's taken me over a year, but I'm almost finished. Good talk. There's the door. I am very good with my paws. You know, there is a nobility in the act of creating. The world would be a much better place if everybody made art and nobody worked. [shrieking, blowing] [Hector yelling] I think that went great. The witch doctors are pretty sure he'll make a full recovery. [gasps] [groaning] Mmm! - Yum. - [gasps] But... How can... Why... [gasping] [screaming] Eighty-three percent approval? How is it getting worse? That is the opposite of what I am wanting! Hector has a large family, honey. They aren't your biggest fans right now. But, hey, 83 percent! That's still huge. Up top! I don't even know why I try. On the bright side, at least now we know Hector was the one-percenter. And we know we're never ever gonna change his mind so we can now move on with our ever-loving lives. Uh, actually, Hector refused to answer the question. He's clean. And I checked him out all the way back to his ancestors. - What's up with all this? - This is the start of a rebellion. I told you all it takes is one. And now, these new poll numbers? By my calculations, we're looking at a full-on conspiracy. Don't do that thing with the eye again. Ooh, a conspiracy! That sounds so dangerous and exciting! - And overblown, and paranoid. - Yes, exactly! Keep up the good work, Clover. Thank you, and on it! - Is she always like this? - She's usually worse, baby. On to much importanter issues. It's been brought to my attention by my own brain just now that we need to do something for the 17 percentage who don't like me to let them know I am on their side. I don't know, Your Majesty, maybe we should just let this blow over. Yeah, that sounds a lot like waiting. The problem is annoying me right now! I guess it couldn't hurt to do something simple that plays to your strengths. Yes, my boyish good looks. My mind-blowing dance moves. Yeah. My double-jointed thumb. Check it. Eh? Eh? - [thumb cracks] - Ow! Too far! Too far! Maurice, don't you see what the problem with your first idea was? - It was actually your idea. - I was hiding, instead of being in front and center. I need to make a real connection with my adoring subjects and show them that I am a simple down-to-earth lemur of the people. Now, go get my tuxedo! [crowd cheering] - King Julien! - Yeah! All right! Hello, loyal subjects and fanboys. I, King Julien, would like to make a personal connection with you by kissing your offsprings. And listening to your opinions because I "value" them. Eh, now bring to me the low-hanging fruits of your loins! [baby crying] This is actually going pretty good. I know. I am like a genius of baby-kissing! This is so easy! - Here you go. - Keep it going. They're loving it. Ahh! Everything I imagined it would be. Mort! I am busy winning everyone's approval. Well, you've got my vote, Mr. President. [giggling, yelps] I'll never wash this forehead again! - [gasping] - No! [lemur] Eww, the king just kicked a baby! Ah! No. No, no! That was no baby! That was an annoying, little weirdo! [lemur 2] He just called that baby a weirdo! [lemur] The king hates babies! [groaning, gulps] Eating my weight in kumquats was my dream job. [belching] The dream has become a nightmare. Why does he have to eat all the kumquats again? Because it's the only thing that brings me joy anymore, that's why. [Julien sighs] Ever since I was a little lemur boy, people have always liked me. "That adorable child has star quality," they'd say. "My own child is a disappointment next to how likable little Julien is." Is it too much to ask for my citizens to like me as much as I like them? Oh, here I am, doing all the talking. You're welcome to jump in. Is Clover right? Is there a bad mango poisoning everything? Let us be honest, is there even such a thing as a bad mango? What kind of weirdo doesn't love mangos? Is that the point you are making? That if I give mangos to everyone, they'll be all, "Hey, check out the free mangos! Great job, King Julien! We like you, buddy!" Amelia, you are more than just a pretty face! [Clover] Icepick. Fat Carmine. Skinny Carmine. Vinnie Tickles. And The Yam-burglar. Think, Clover, think! It's all right there in front of you. You just... You have to connect the dots. It can't be. [sighing] Guess I still have a few more dots to connect. [Julien] My idea is brilliant. There should be a word for giving people things to win their approval. - You mean, bribery? - Bribery. Ooh! Sounds so noble. Uh, Mort, have you collected all the mangos for the bribery? I have collected them! And I saved the sweetest one for you, King Julien. Oh! [laughing] [grunts] [snoring] - I should wake her up. - I wouldn't. - [grunting] - I killed the king! [groaning] Oh, no. But... But I can't feel my... anything. Oh! Sorry, I've been up for two days. My mind is free from mundane distractions. I love how dangerous I feel right now! Would you like to hear what I've found? - OK, sure! - Go right ahead. I started with the simple idea that everyone's a suspect. From there... I can tell if somebody's lying. Her mouth was saying, "Yes," but her twitchy eye was saying, "Maybe." That, my friends, was a game-changer! It's always the quiet ones, you know? Just... Just... [exclaiming] And I'm all... [vocalizing conflict] A bigger conspiracy? The New World Order? The Old World Order? So, in conclusion, - I've learned that the hater... - [all] Eh? - The one-percenter... - [all] Eh? The citizen who truly has it out for King Julien is... [all] Eh?? - That's all I got so far. - [all groaning] Uh, you really need to get some rest, girl. You're sounding a little... cuckoo, cuckoo! [giggling] Bird noises. Yeah, can't we just call off the investigation and move on? But I'm so close to solving this thing! Give me one more day. Please. - Yeah, knock yourself out. - On it! [yelling, grunts] [groaning] Let us bribery the kingdom with mangos! - [dance music playing] - [crowd cheering] - [grunts] Hey! - The king's A-OK with me! [grumbling] Like mangos are gonna help the situation. He's a strong leader I can really get behind! It is raining mangos! Hallelujah! [laughs] Mort! Go long, buddy! [panting] Oh! I can't believe King Julien convinced me to go out in this stupid, leaky, potty boat. He's the worst! Sweet mango! You're the best, King J! - [all chanting] Julien! Julien! Julien! - See? You were worried for nothing. - I told you they like you. - Uh, I got some bad news. Looks like we're just about out of mangos. Well, maybe they've had enough mangos already. More mangos! More mangos! More mangos! More mangos! More mangos! More mangos! OK, OK. Be patient. Everyone will get a mango. You know that's not true! Shh! Maurice, it's called stalling. [tree creaking] Fellas, I'm not sure this tree is going to hold much more weight. Oh, you worry too much. [yelping] OK, maybe you worry the correct amount. Folks, we need everyone to back up. - [giggling] Oh! - [all yelling] - Uh-oh. - [gasping] [yelling] [crowd gasping] Yes, yes! Look at me! I have saved this mango! I think they're a little more impressed you saved a baby! Oh, but that is ridiculous, Maurice! You can't even eat a baby! [yelps] Yes, yes. Love me! The savior of this adorable, little mango! And also a baby, I guess. [laughing] Everybody loves you again. You're back on top. I have learned a valuable lesson today. You realized the folks closest to you are the ones whose opinions really matter? I was going to say I learned any time things are going bad for me, I can publicly rescue a small child. But maybe you're right. Besides, what do I care about one dummy who doesn't like me? I bet I like that dummy even less. [laughs] I'm over it! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, that's it? You're over it? But what about my investigation? I can easily make up for the one hater. I'll just have to love myself twice as much. Maurice, make sure that's reflected in my schedule. - But I haven't solved the case yet. - I know. But I've totally lost interest, so who cares now? [sighing] [Mort straining] - [Clover] Hold on a minute, Mort. - [stammering] Me? All the clues pointed to you, but it didn't add up. I thought I was cracking under the pressure, thought I was going crazy. - Well, um... - Why'd you do it, Mort? Why'd you say you don't like King Julien? I don't like King Julien! I love him! [Giggling]
