 {\i1}♪ All hail King Julien! ♪{\i0} Welcome to our biannual nature ceremony, the Soggy Solstice! Raise your empty water barrels to the sky so that Kevin, the god of precipitation, will fill them with moist riches. For if we do not have water, what will happen? [all] Our insides will dry out! Exactly. And to perform the traditional rain dance... King Julien!

 Your Majesty, that's your cue. Bow, left foot over right foot, kick-ball change. Or is it running man then kick-ball change? Ah! I can't follow steps! I go where my heinie takes me. It's a gift. Your Majesty, please. The king has to perform the dance as choreographed or it won't rain. Fine, but I'm not going out there alone. I need a friend by my side. Oh, your Majesty, I would be honored... Where's Boombox? Aw, yeah! That's right, Kevin.

 These moves are all for you, baby. Prepare to have your god mind blown and bring the rain, baby! - What the... - [murmuring] Mystic music Boombox! What's wrong? Speak to me, old friend! [cries] Maurice! There's no tune. I'm sorry, your Majesty. Boombox is gone. [crying] No! Tragic. Well, back to making it rain. Rain? Boombox is dead, you heartless lizard! I will never dance again, which means no one will dance again! But your Majesty, the nature gods require the king to dance. Can the gods give me back my mystic music Boombox? They don't work that way. Then what good are they? Find another chorus boy to get jiggy for you, Kevin! Come on, Boombox. That was intentional! Wait, wait. Where's the king going? We need rain! Oh, I can already feel my liver turning into jerky! What if we drink our sweat? Everyone put their barrels under their armpits. Go! This is really not good. He'll come back... I hope. I'll stall. Hey, uh... Sorry, deities... and everybody else. We are experiencing technical and metaphysical difficulties. Please stand by for the... The comedy stylings of... this guy! - He kills me. - Whoa. Uh, so... Where's everybody from? [all] Madagascar! Right. Should've known that. It should have been me. I mean, not really, I'm far too important. But still, you will always be in my heart, mystical Boombox. Ashes to ashes, junk to junk. Ouch! Boombox? Is that you? Are you haunting me already? Help me! Excuse me, but why are you masquerading as Boombox's ghost? Hello? Are you unconscious or just being rude? I'm trapped. True dat. Aren't we all in one way or another? Oh, you mean literally. You need to be careful around here, little fella. Try wearing something reflective perhaps. Wow! It's been years. That voice. That space between your eyes. No doubt there is royal blood coursing through those veins. Yup, I can smell the inbreeding. A Julien King, am I right? I'm right, right? Right. No, of course. Yeah, of course I'm right. Timo. And what is a "Timo"? Where do I start? The beginning? The end? Nope, can't start there. We haven't arrived yet. I'm a tenrec. Yeah. And, uh, seeing as I am not paralyzed, I think I can help you. Yep, figured her for a set of D's. It's a "she"? The minx never let on. There! Now for a quick transplant. It's... a miracle! Why, thank you, kind sir. Thank you, thank you, and... Oh! Where are my manners? Welcome to my laboratory. You're a little weird, aren't you? Comes with the territory when you're a scientist like me. Scientist, you say? Is that how you revived Boombox? Are you some kind of god? I always thought you guys were taller. Did you just call me a god? Hm, charmer. You're being weird again. Uh, sorry. Not a god. Science revived Boombox. Actually, it created Boombox too. Science can pretty much do anything. Anything, you say? Hmm... Tell me more about this... science. [lemur] The rain is never gonna come! [Ted] Oh, we're doomed! And now for my big finish! Sun! Uh, we're going to take a ten-minute intermission, but don't go nowhere. [Mort] I'm okay. This is a disaster. The King must return soon or Kevin will take his rain and go! Hah! Huh! Why didn't anyone call me when the King left? I should be with him. He's alone out there. That's dangerous for everyone. Listen here, girlie, don't be layin' this on me. You, me, and my all-seeing tongue know the ugly truth to why you weren't here. [Clover narrating]{\i1} "The warrior princess {\i0}T{\i1}highsander Plunderhorse{\i0} {\i1}came upon{\i0} {\i1}the Unicorn cautiously.. {\i1}But the great beast was {\i0}n{\i1}ot an enemy, for it said, {\i0} {\i1}'I am not a true unicorn, {\i0} {\i1}but an enchanted prince {\i0}n{\i1}amed Norge Grendelfist.. {\i1}Kiss my horn, Thighsander, a{\i0}n{\i1}d I am yours.'".{\i0} My fan fiction is private, and it better stay that way. But where is King Julien? My insides are dehydrating! And I just coughed up a handful of dust that used to be my lungs! We're all gonna die! Please, everyone, calm down. [Julien] What is going on here, people? You're acting like someone died. Wro-o-o-ong! - King Julien! - He's back! Boombox is alive! It's a miracle! Or Boombox isn't alive and he's a zombie come to eat our brains! So the gods came through after all. Oh, Maurice, you poor, simple-minded person. The gods had nothing to do with it. My peoples of Madagascar, I have had a vision of the future, and that vision is called science! What the gods once provided, or didn't, if we were late for our "sacrificial appointment," can now be provided by these science magic devices, which are so much more convenient. And this is the tenrec who made it all possible. Timo! Take a bow, science magic guy! Uh, full disclosure, absolutely none of this is magic. Timo the Science Wizard! Let's give him a hand, people. Although I do love role playing games, but you have to bring your own dice 'cause that's how I roll. Your Majesty, these trinkets are fine, but the kingdom is more concerned about rain than silly distractions. Hoo-hoo-hoo! You gotta feel this! Ah! It's like someone breathing their hot breath on you, only it doesn't stink like old mangoes. I can feel the science spirit moving through me! It's a miracle! Oh-ho! It appears the people have spoken. You were saying, Masikura? - [machine dings] - [all] Science! Science! Science. [Burps] [whimpers] Don't eat me! Science! [chuckles] Now this is progress. Feeeeeet. Eh, why has my vibrating foot fantasy wand ceased its vibrating foot fantasy? Could you wear a bell or something around your neck so I know when you're around? A word, King Julien? Ugh, out of magic again. Someone fetch me the royal Sci-zard! That's what I'm calling Timo. It means "Science Wizard." You wouldn't get it. Eh, you just explained it. Yet there you are, with that totally-not-getting-it look on your face. The only thing I don't get is you refusing to honor sacred traditions! Without rain, this kingdom cannot survive. No. Without this baby hand fan, we cannot survive. See? Timo, my royal wizard! You've met Masikura, the King's maybe once but not-so-much-anymore mystical advisor? Wait! Are you firing me? It's more of a "fire-tunity." A whole new life that doesn't involve working here. What a gift I'm giving you. You're welcome. Generations of your ancestors put their faith in me and my ability to commune with the nature gods. And, hello, look what it did for them. Dead from "natural causes." Timo's science can actually make stuff. Stuff called panini! You will be sorry, King Julien! You requested to see me? Yes. My foot wand needs more magic. Should just need a charge. Whatever you say, Science... Warlock? - No. - Witch doctor? No. Enchanter? Necromancer? Spell caster? Mage? No to all of those. Eh, you'll figure it out. What a team we are. With science as my copilot, nothing could possibly go wrong... ever! For many seasons, I served as mystic advisor to the royal court. - Where did it get me? - Where you goin'? Oh, hello, Mort. I am going... Well, I don't know. Really? Well, um, I got some extra space in my stump. Well, I don't... Aw, come on! Where else you gonna go now that no one wants you? Sorry. Word gets around, you know. Well, I could use a place to regroup for a few days. Yay! New roomie! Wait, weren't you already rooming with Horst? Oh, yeah. That didn't work out. He had a problem with my sleep hugging. Your sleep hugging? Yeah, you know. It's like sleepwalking only I end up in your bed hugging you. I get so scared at night. Sometimes it's nice to be held. Only a few days ago, we had no idea how science magic and its offspring appliances, would change our lives. No longer do we have to wait for the gods to blow stuff up. Science can do it for us. Standing around while the gods grow our mangoes? Forget that! Science shoves mangoes right into our mouths. I love you, science! [burps] Instant gratification. [giggles] King Julien, look at this! Woo-hoo! Science totally owned that jungle. Could Kevin destroy a rain forest with a bunch of food processors? - I think not. My blender has stopped. I can't drink my smoothie. It's too chunky! What happened to my food? I'll starve! King Julien, what's going on? Do I look like tech support, Maurice? Sci-zard! Oh, my... Uh, yeah. We're having magic issues again. Don't make me regret that I'm paying you. Are you paying me? Would I remember that? Yes, I'd remember that. No, you're not paying me. Really? Hey, nice work, K.J. Oh, don't mention it. Looks like a power surge. Wha... A power...? Magic surge. Probably tripped a breaker or breaked a tripper, which by the way is the name of my fictional band. I'm gonna need to make a trip down to my workshop. Not alone, you're not. You're taking Clover with you for protection. You're family now, Timo. Haven't I always wanted a brother, Maurice? I can't remember you ever wanting... Don't listen to him. You changed my life, you glorious, little Science... - Sorcerer? - No. Elf? Wow! You really have rough, dry skin, roomie. You know, I have a lotion made from my own tears. My skin is rough because I have scales, Mort. Oh. That's so sad. Don't worry, I'll keep your secret. - Eh, I'm going to take a bath. - Ow! Okay. No water. You know, you try to warn them. Try to be the good lizard. Do they listen? No! They... Wah! Oh, this is so much fun. I feel just like we're sisters. You're not a girl, Mort. I'll never be alone because you're here. Roomies forever. So, you must be pretty smart to know about this science magic stuff. Eh, it's a blessing and a curse. For instance, I can smell the pheromones secreting from your musk gland and know that you don't have a mate. That's the blessing. The curse is that I just said that out loud. Here we go. Uh! Oh! Ah! Timo, get out of there! All hope is lost! What's happening?! Your Majesty, you have to tell the people everything will be all right without science. But without science, how will I use my fondue fountain? What will become of my garment steamer? We've been though worse! Clearly you have not experienced my fondue fountain. Everything tastes so much better covered in chocolate. We've got a problem. - Really? - Where's Timo? Science has abandoned us, Clover. This is no time to have misplaced him. He's back at the Cove. The magic making generator is on fire, and a flame is headed this way! But we will get our appliances back, right? - Julien! - Yes, all right, I know! The kingdom before melty goodness. To the royal water reserves! - Oh. - [Maurice] Empty. No problem. To the royal hot tub! Oh. I've hit worse bottoms. No problem. To the... - Oh, wait, that's it. Your Majesty, that flame will be here any minute, and if it catches the baobab tree on fire... Oh, buckle-up your worry pants, Clover. Our kingdom is in a natural rain forest. We wait for the sky to make rain, and voosh... Rain beats fire. Except we haven't had any rain for days because you never did your rain dance! Wait. That's what the dance was for? You know that was what the dance was for! I must have forgotten. It was years ago. - It was yesterday. - I was in shock, Maurice! Boomy-box had just died. Clearly you have never loved with passion! It's still not too late. A five, six, seven, eight... Kick-ball change, jazz hands. Ah! Why isn't it working?! The gods must be mad you chose science over them. Yes. Besides being the god of moisture, Kevin is also the most sensitive. Perhaps if I offered him a yogurt maker... Or you apologize to Masikura and she makes this right. You're leaving? [gasps] Yes. I've had a... vision of what will happen if I stay here. It's not pretty. But I had so many plans. I was hoping you would braid my hair. Mort, you don't have any... Look again, girlfriend. Just a little something I picked up in the cove of wonders. Roomie, do you like? Okay, then... Buh-bye! What if I don't want you to go? Well, then I'd be forced to do this. Wha...? You can keep the security deposit. King Julien, what are you doing here? No clue. Bye! Your Majesty, don't you have something to say to Masikura? Oh, yes, right. I wanted to say... [muttering] sorry for mocking your rain ceremony. Please come back to work for me. - What? - What? I didn't say anything. - King Julien! - Fine! [loudly] I wanted to say I'm sorry for mocking your rain ceremony. Please come back to work for me. Oh, really? So you're apologizing? Well, that's too bad because I'm very happy where I am... Hi. Uh, yes. I... love it here. Like you said, my new life is a gift. Please, Masikura! A fire is heading toward the kingdom! It's too late. The time for rain has passed. I warned you not to forsake the gods, King Julien, and now, science has doomed your kingdom. [Timo] Not necessarily! Science created a little thing called a "garden hose"! Yeah. Makes big tinkle-tinkle to put out the fire, which is almost here! Wait. Don't we need water, which we are out of, to make Timo's hose work? Oh, yeah. Fortunately for science, the gods may know a way to get your hose working again. - Fire! - It's Armageddon! One of nature's greatest tricks is disguise, but the gods always leave a sign where water can be found. Moist decaying matter rich in insect droppings. Wow. I would love to rut here. This is the sign. If we dig, we will find water. Hold the cow. Are you saying that a super power wonder twins team-up of science and the gods could make it rain and save the kingdom? [both] Yes. You, go! Bring on the rain, baby! The hose! It's all swollen! We have to "un-swole" it! I can fix it! - You can? - Yes! - How? - With dance! My rain dance! Somebody drop me a beat. {\i1}♪ Body, body, body, body {\i0}M{\i1}ove your body ♪{\i0} {\i1}♪ Make sure you don't {\i0}h{\i1}urt nobody ♪{\i0} [sighs] Well, Maurice, it appears your king has brought the rain after all. Ah, no. Timo and Masikura brought the rain. Uh, I did the dance, man. Those steps weren't easy, you know. Hey, everybody! Undead Boombox has something s{\i1}he w{\i0}ants to tell you.
