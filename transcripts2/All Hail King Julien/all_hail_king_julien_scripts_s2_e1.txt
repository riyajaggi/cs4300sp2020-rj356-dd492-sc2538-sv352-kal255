[foosas snarling] [Mort panting, yells] - Thank you, Clover. - Only doing my job, Mort. I almost went fear pee-pee. Whoopsie. I just did. Ha ha ha ha! [lemurs screaming] Okay, now, everyone line up. I'm calling this the food pyramid.

 King Julien, how is it supposed to keep us safe from the foosa? The foosa get full by eating all the tastiest lemurs on the bottom and won't be hungry when they get to me at the top. - Hmm? - [snarling] Hold. [growling] You on the bottom, remember to look extra delicious. - Hold! - [growling] [lemurs scream] Where are they all going? This is a disaster, Maurice! - [growling] - Aah! Tell me when you've been eaten, I can't look. You can't look? I can't look. [foosa shrieks] [howling] Foosa in trouble? Blech! Foosa run away! Foosa run away! [all chattering] [all cheering] The foosas are leaving! And I survived! Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! Whew! Thank the gods that Clover put that net trap there. It really saved us. Just doing my job. And thank the gods even more that I was genius enough to put my food pyramid in front of that net trap, eh? You didn't even know it was there. Hmm? Uhh. Maurice, are you even listening to yourself with your, "Clover's net trap, ooh!" And all your doubt and stuff. You never support me. You kidding me? You were just standing on my shoulders so I could be eaten first. I was literally supporting you. Ha! Let's face it, Maurice. You've never really believed in me or any of my ideas. [stammering] But that-- That is not true. I've always supported you, no matter how crazy the crazy. Might I remind you of your reaction to my backward whistling experiment? [blowing raspberries] You see? Right there, right there. The lack of support is all over your face! What do you want me to do with this one, Your Majesty? Hmm, let me think. I want to make an example of this foosa. Now you're talking my language, Your Majesty. Where do we start? With a little bit of this? Hyah! Or a little bit of this? Ah-yah-ta-ta-ta-ta! Huh! Huh! Huh! Or this one. I really love this one. [grunting] Uh, dial it down, Clover. I don't want any of whatever that was you were doing. I want to lemur-ize this foosa. Ha ha ha! You're gonna what-erize the who now? Lemur-ize the foosa. A very scientific term which means "to make something lemur." Why would you want to do that, Your Majesty? Mostly because certain Doubting Debras around here don't ever back me up. I'm not gonna lower myself by naming names. [coughing] Maurice! I'm talking about Maurice! [coughing] By disguising it as a cough! [coughing] Maurice! Maurice! Maurice! - Subtle. - I know, right? But you can't turn a foosa into a lemur. That's a terrible idea. Ohh! Right there! You see that? Way not to be back me up yet again... [coughing] Maurice! You two aren't seeing the B-I-G picture here. A lemur-ized foosa could return to her peoples and tell them how fun and awesome we are and to stop eating us. Think of it. Peace in our time zone. Wow. That actually is a good idea. Let the lemur-izing begin! - [foosa roars] - Maybe with a little help? [roaring] I will now lemur-ize this foosa through the magic of science. Timo, thank you for volunteering. Actually, I-- I believe I tried running away. The unknown is always frightening, especially when it will most likely eat you. [roaring] Okay, here goes. Synaptic functionality should be-- - [Timo screaming] - [foosa roaring] [Timo] Oh, that's my toe! Ow! You go after the toes?! Of all things-- [screaming] My head! I'm gonna feel that later. Uh, I was hoping that would go better, but I did warn him. New plan! I will now lemur-ize this foosa through the magic... of magic. Uh, I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to be doing here. Work your magic. Lick her tiny foosa brain. Meld with her mind. I really don't-- [grunting] - [Julien] Heh? Come on! - [foosa growling] Tongue that foosa full of brain magic, lady! - [roars] - Aah! [crashing] [sighs] Not going well at all. King Julien, I think maybe it's time to stop all of this. While it is sad that some lemurs must get mauled to bring about peace, and prove you wrong, Maurice, I will not quit! I just need a new plan. I will now lemur-ize this foosa through the magic of interpretive dance. Ted, let's stomp this yard. - I am a little bird... - [roaring] ...who cannot fly. But lo, I am the mighty wind, breaking beneath your wings to lift you skyward! Uh... huh. Feel the power of the breaking wind! Feel it! [growls] Oh, hey, aah! Oh, I felt it, Ted. I felt the power of your breaking wind. [Julien groaning] [foosa snarling] Why are the hard problems so hard and not easy like hard problems are supposed to be? [foosa growls] [sniffing] Halt! Who goes there? It's me, Horst. I smelled something. A perfume I haven't smelled since... [sniffing] - Aah! - If you don't stop smelling me, I will rip your nose off and shove it up your... nose. That doesn't really make sense because if I ripped it off, I can't really... It's a bit confusing. Or somewhere. You get the idea. Right, fine, fine. It just doesn't make sense. [sniffing, slurping] Clover, what's all the noise? Who was that strange guy inhaling your lady musk? - That's Horst. - Who? I've done a full dossier of every member of the kingdom. Let's see. Horst. Not much is known about him. Kind of a loner. Fears change. Often seen holding a beverage. Yeah, sounds like a freak. Please keep the freaks away! I'm thinking in here. [growling] I know there is more inside of you than just a lot of lemur bits. [roaring] Aah! Uhh! [growling] [screaming] Don't eat me! The world would be an uglier place without the luscious booty of these royal cheeks. [grunting] [piano music playing] Hmm. What just happened? [music stops] [roars] [piano music resumes] Ohh, you saucy minx. You are digging my tuneage. [growling] - [jazz music playing] - Oh, you like jazz. - [music changes] - No? Rumba. Saucy sauciness. - [music changes] - Let's do the mambo. Oh, snap, here comes the bossa nova. - [music changes] - Ha ha ha ha! [panting] - Look at my fair foosa. - [purring] All sweet. [grunt] Mary Ann. Ooh, you have a name? [growling] Mmm. Foosa name Mary Ann! Well... [growling] Mary Ann... I believe it is time to... let the lemur-izing begin. For reals this time. [dance music playing] If you want to be a lemur, you need to shake... shake that booty! Shake it like you're gonna break it! Then break it like you're gonna make it! Then make it like you're gonna take it. Take it, Mary Ann, take it, it's all yours. [panting] Oh, uh, I like the outside-the-box thinking. Ahem. I guess we can start with the-- the alphabet. Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhh! Oh, I know this! Let me! Let me! "A" is for "feet," "B" is for "feet." - What? Huh? - Go to "F." Because what's "F" for? "F" is for "feet"! - Ow! - Stop it. [Julien] Some of us are trying to learn here, Mort. [muttering] Hmm. Madness. Utter madness. [slurps] [speaking clearly] You know what they say, King Julien. The only thing worse than being eaten by a foosa is not being eaten by a foosa. - [spits] - [laughing] [chuckling] You realize you're laughing about our people being eaten. Ha ha ha! I know, isn't it great? Ohh, Mary Ann, you are a treasure. Mary Ann, this is called a hot tub. It's something traditionally used to relax after a long day of being chased and eaten by your people. It's also fun to toot in. [straining] [water bubbles] [giggles] [straining] [boom] - Aah! - Aah! Was that good, King Julien? Good? Uh, no. Not good. That was amazing! Mary Ann, I believe it's time you met the entire kingdom. Celebratory bubbles! [straining] Wait. All right. I had one earlier. Hold on. [straining] [bubbling] Okay, it's time for us to get out of the Jacuzzi. This will end badly. [slurps] Ahh. [overlapping chatter] Hello, all my wonderful peoples! You all love me, yes? - [crowd] Yeah! - [female lemur] Affirmative! And now I will give you one more reason to love me even better. - [cheering] - Yes! Yes! I give you my greatest, bestest and most amazing creation ever, other than the 80-foot shaved ice statue of my butt, which was pretty amazing, right? No, it melted before I could eat it. [giggles] I give you... Mary Ann. [purrs] - Foosa! - [all screaming] We're all gonna die! Huh? Cut to the musical number. Cut to the musical number. A-one, a-two, a-five, six, seven, eight. [dance music playing] ♪ Three little maids from school are we ♪ ♪ Pert as a schoolgirl well can be ♪ ♪ Filled to the brim with girlish glee ♪ ♪ Three little maids from school ♪ ♪ Oh, yeah ♪ - [cheering] - Yes! Yes! - Huh? - Ha ha! [lemur] Mary Ann! Mary Ann! Thank you all for embracing me so warmly. It can't be easy, since I have no doubt killed and eaten many of your relatives. But over the coming weeks, I look forward to helping the kingdom any way I can. [cheering] [slurping] I gotta admit, King Julien, your idea worked. You actually lemur-ized that foosa. - Now what happens? - Ha ha! I have no idea. I didn't think my idea would actually work. Isn't that great? I'm even backing me now. [Mary Ann] "...regarding Machiavelli's idea that anyone who was strong enough to seize power was entitled to keep it. The king saw this as an open invitation to rebellion and regicide." I'm not so sure she's teaching them the right stuff. She's teaching them big words, Maurice, like "regicide." "Regi--" Say it, it rolls off the-- Such a fancy word. Uh, you do know that "regicide" means "the killing of a king," Your Majesty? See? That is one extra-fancy word. So royal, so regal. Your Majesty, you're the king. Yes. Oh. I'd like to field some questions right now as to how to judge if King Julien is a good king or not. Okay! Thank you! Thank you, Mary Ann. What? Mary Ann, sweetheart, you know you're my favorite foosa. But maybe, just maybe, before you start teaching the huddled masses about killing kings and stuff, you could, uh, run it by me first. Someone has to stop this. [slurping] [snoring] [Julien] Maurice, stop snoring. King Julien, are you awake yet? - [snoring] Maurice, stop snoring. - Hmm? Hmm. Hmm. [mumbles] Maurice, stop snoring. King Julien? King Julien?! Because, Madam, my tushy has a mind of its own and it will kiss whomever it likes! What? Oh, I love that dream. [yawns] Mary Ann, why are you pounding the royal eardrums at this early hour? I couldn't wait. I made a list of ways you can run the kingdom better. See? I think we'll start with the suggestion box. Then we can set up a judiciary system. Mary Ann, please, you're hurting the royal brain stuffings. I'll give you a chance to approve those while I get the suggestion box set up. That's what education and intellect get you. - Aah! - Free will. Mm-hmm. Free will gets you opinions, opinions get you suggestions, and suggestions, well, they get you killed. Now, uneducated and complacent: that's what really makes for a happy kingdom. Oh, Clover, you're overreacting. Am I? King Julien VIII, he had a suggestion box. Until rebellion broke out and they buried him in it... alive! [whispering spookily] Anarchy, rebellion, destruction. They'll burn it all down. Burn it. Burn it all do-o-o-own! Okay, stop talking like that in my ear, Clover. You're really creeping me out. [muttering] Yeah, this one isn't so bad. Yeah, I've actually thought about this one as well. [muttering] Aah! "Increase productivity by removing redundant holidays such as King Julien's All-Lemur Dance Party Week"? [buzzer sounds] "King Julien's Lady Lemurs Night Week Dance Party Week"? [buzzer sounds] "King Julien's Baby Lemurs Just Gotta Dance Dance Party Week"? What? [buzzer sounds] Uhh! I've created a monster, Clover! A monster! We have to get rid of her, Your Majesty, for your own safety. Yes, but how? My people love me for creating her. You need plausible deniability. Let me handle it. But I'll need a fall guy to take the blame in case, you know, it all goes horribly wrong. [both] Mort! So, everyone puts their suggestions in the box, and we decide which ones King Julien should follow. Hmm, what if he doesn't want to? Well, then we just implement them ourselves. We definitely need more community theater. This is a nightmare. Community theater? You see what happens when I am not supported by you, Maurice? For the record, I never told you to turn a foosa into a lemur. - Maybe not in so many words. - Not in any words. - Pretty sure there were a few. - No. - One? - None. Pretty sure. Pretty... sure. I can hear you. You did this all on your own. We'd better just hope Clover has come up with a clever plan to fix this mess. Pretty sure. Now everyone will see the truth of what that foosa really is. - Operation: Cooking Spices is a go! - Ha ha! And once our suggestions are implemented, we'll be free to decide if we even need a king. We'll make our own rules. And-- [crowd gasps] What? What is this stuff? [sniffing] Spices? Cooking spices? Cooking spices? We're-- We're being marinated?! People, it's really more of a dry rub than a marinade. Mmm, it smells so good. So... very... hungry. I have to... [all scream] [muffled shouting] - [screaming] - [roaring] I will set you free! Free to think for yourselves by... eating you! [lemurs screaming] [Mary Ann growling] Ow! Ah ha ha ha ha! Aah! Is there time to construct another kingly food pyramid? No! Just run, King Julien, run! No! No, you can't get away, King Julien! Over here, Your Majesty! - Take Maurice! - What?! Huh? You're going down, Mary Ann. Or should I say, going up. Hyah! [all scream] Please, Clover, I changed out your traps days ago. So smart, Mary Ann. Ha! Uh, I'd be incredibly proud right now if you weren't about to eat me. [snarling] Ha ha ha ha! [Julien] Cooking spices? Really, Clover? This was your big plan? Phase one of Operation: Cooking Spices was meant to show everyone what a savage animal Mary Ann is. I got so excited about phase one. Really didn't plan a phase two. But you gotta admit, phase one really worked. - Look at how savage she is. - [growls] I mean, she's gonna eat us, which kind of really makes my point for me. You know? With the, uh... with the eating. [all gasp] Less talking, more basting. I would like to say one thing, Mary Ann. This is all Mort's fault. I regret nothing! Then I shall eat you first. Hooray! [all groaning] [Horst] Mary A-a-a-a-ann! - Huh? - Mary Ann. [slurps] Horst? Is it really... you? You there! Freak! What is his name again? - Horst. - Right. Freak! You know this foosa? Yes. This foosa... is my wife! - [all gasp] - Scandal! [playing ominous tune] Mort, where did you get an organ? [giggles] I'll never tell. Horst, I thought when I mauled you that last time, I killed you. That's... why I ran away. I survived and everything grew back... except for my broken heart. [slurps] But now you've broken the broken pieces. To see you like this... uhh. Horst! I've missed you. Come back to me. Oh, Horst. ♪ It starts in the night I get this feeling ♪ ♪ Thinking 'bout you My mind's all reeling... ♪ [screaming] [Julien laughing] Let's drop in on our little lovebirds, Horst and Mary Ann, and wish them a very good morning. - [crunch] - Uhh! You're on my small intestines! Horst? What happened? She left me. She mauled me and she left me again. - But why? - Oh, it was... never our lack of communication that broke us apart before. It was my snoring. I snore like a monster. It makes her really crazy. She's gone, gone back to her own kind. Well, even though Horst may never walk again or tinkle properly, at least we know, because of me, there is one foosa out there who will be able to lead a more fulfilling, happy and peaceful life. [Mary Ann] My fellow foosas... hear me! I return to you much changed. I have seen beneath my savage hunger and discovered my superior intellect. I will teach you. I will lead you. Not only will we rule Madagascar, we shall rule the world! [confused groaning] [sniffs] [sighs] This is gonna be a lot harder than I thought. [upbeat music playing]
