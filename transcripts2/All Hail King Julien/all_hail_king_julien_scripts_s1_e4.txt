 [Julien groans] [moans] Aah, so parched! The royal tongue needs moisture. Maurice! I need liquid. [sniffs] And why do I smell like your armpit? Oh! [Shrieks] Who are you? Why are you in my chambers? Oh, you're me. Hello. Not cool to frighten the king. [yells] The royal eyeballs appear to have been ridden hard and put away extra veiny. Maybe a certain someone needs to dial the nightlife down a smidge - now that he's... - [chanting] King Julien! King Julien! - [shrieks] - King Julien! King Julien!

 Maurice, where are you? Get in here now! OK, OK, I've got your water right here. [gargling, gulps] Aah! Forget the water! Oh, it was delicious, by the way. Very refreshing. Why is there a kingdom of peeping Toms out there? - [crowd murmuring] - [Maurice sighs] You don't remember last night, do you? I have no time for remembering. I am a king, remember? [sighs] I was afraid of that. You threw a party last night, Your Majesty. A huge party. [dance music playing] Whoo-hoo! Let me hear it, peoples! - When I say "King," you say... - [all] Julien! - King! - Julien! - King! - Julien! I am the lemur king! I can do anything! [laughing] [yells] [crowd cheers] [sighs] Where is this going, Maurice, besides into my scrapbook of awesome memories I have no memory of? If the party had stopped there, we'd be fine. Problem is, you kept going. And going. And going. Aah! I love you, my peoples! Did you just fall, Dorothy, or did the floor need a hug? Hey, Masikura, let's get slithered, my lizard! And then you went too far. - [dance music playing] - [laughing] [cheering] You always had my back, Hector! You... You believed in me, Ted. Anything you want, Willie, you just gotta ask me! We're brothers, Mort. [whispers] Brothers! - I love you, man. - [Mort sighs] I decree King Julien will solve all dilemmas, disputes and disagreements. - Just come on by. - [cheering] My throne is always open. [echoing] open ...open ...open. That's why they're here. You promised to solve, well, everything. Not my fault, I was born a giver! Can't we just tell them I'm not here so they'll go away? They already saw you. Then I'll just take it back. I'm the king. This is your first big decree as king. If you take it back, the kingdom will never trust you ag... It's a riot! Everyone away from the windows! This is not a drill! [grunting] [growls] Why are you two just standing there? At least act like you're panicking. This isn't a riot, Clover. [scoffs] Please, I think I know a riot when I see... Yeah, sorry. Apparently, I opened my mouth again, trying to "help people" and that was "wrong." He promised to solve everyone's problems. What were you thinking? That my people were hurting, or at least complaining a lot. And since I guess I can't hide, I am going to honor my decree and help them. This could go south in a heartbeat. Look at them, with their hopes and dreams and ideas of personal freedom. Come on, Clover, it's just a group of ordinary lemurs. A group is just a mob that hasn't turned yet. - That's kinda paranoid, Clover. - Good. Paranoia is just common sense that hasn't turned yet. - [Maurice] OK, OK, I don't think that... - Oop. See that? Tail twitch. That means danger. You should get that checked. I want to set up a security checkpoint down on the ground. Yes, Clover, listen to your tail and do... - that thing you just said. - On it! I am the first in line! I must see the king! - Mort, you do not have a problem. - Oh, but I do. I need a royal hug real bad. Eh, Clover needs you to help her sniff out the riffraff. Doesn't that sound fun? I will separate the riff from the raff... for King Julien! Does he know anything about threat assessment? Uh... No. [lemurs chattering] [gulps] OK, spread 'em. [grunts] [gasps] - What's this? - Offering for the king? Nice try. Everyone knows the king hates bananas. - Yes, I, uh... - Oop! That's what I thought. - Mort, you're up! - What do we got? - Commence secret phase four. - I'll put on the rubber glove. Let's do this thing. Bring on the Resolution Day wisdom seekers, Maurice! [clears throat] Your Majesty, Abner and Becca. All right, what do I have no memory of promising you? - It's our watering hole. - It smells. Can't drink it. Can't even swim in it. It's mucky. What? I go to the watering hole every day. The water is clear like crystal and cold and yummy. Smell my breath. [Exhales] It's minty. [Exhales] [Maurice clears throat] You have your own watering hole. The royal watering hole. And the place they're talking about is...? - [whispers] Crosstown. - Oh. The one with the brown water and the random dead things floating in it? [disgusted moan] I know well this watering hole of which you speak. - You do? - Can you fix it? I, King Julien XIII, do decree that this watering hole shall be made fit for drinking, swimming and other water-related good times! - Righteous! - When? Work will begin a very special day. I call it "someday." Thank you big, Your Majesty! This is so easy, making promises! You know you have to keep them, right? One thing at a time, Maurice. Next! Your Majesty, we have a super bad gecko problem in my tree. [male lemur 1] Yeah, and then he said, "No, that's not a mango, that's..." [male lemur 2] Is it too much to ask for a little privacy? I don't watch her. All night long, talking and talking and talking... - [sighs] - and talking... How long have we been at this, Maurice? - Mm... Twenty minutes. - [moans] Other people's problems are so boring! - No offense, Ted. - Oh, no, no, none taken. I was about to doze off mid-sentence there, myself. Sorry to bother ya. I guess I'll bring in whoever's next. Please don't. I cannot do this, Maurice. It's so hard to relate to everybody's issues! All I hear is, "Blah, blah, King Julien, blah, blah, Your Majesty, blah, blah, blah, blah." I can't relate to my subjects because they are so far below me. I need to lower myself way down to their level. You know, to see what it's like in the streets with my own eyeballs. I will start by going down to that watering hole. Uh, wait. - [stammers] No, I still need you here. - [chainsaw whirs] [sawing] Huh? Huh? Check it out, Maurice: Substitute king. Made it myself. Can you tell which one is me? I'm the one talking! Right now! I can... No! This is a bad idea! [Groans] - You did not just leave. - [Julien] Yes, I did! Oh, come on, no one's gonna believe that's... - [male lemur] King Julien? - Oy. [laughs] [giggles maniacally] Right this way. [Julien grunts] If I am going to escape Mort and his glove, I'm going to need an ingenious disguise. Ugh. Bananas. Nature's pasty mistake. [grunts] Wait, wait. Everyone knows I hate bananas. So if I carry this demon fruit with me everywhere, no one will ever suspect it's me. Empty your pockets! I-I don't have pockets. - I've heard that one before. - Aah! [Mort] Freeze! Uh... [lower-pitched voice] Uh, hello, Mor... Mister. - King Julien? - No, no! No. You see, though I am clearly as handsome as your beloved king... I do belove him. But, uh... I got no crown, and check it out: Banana! Oh! The king wears a crown and hates bananas. Yes. Uh, good luck guarding King Banana Hater. Gotta go! [male lemur] Your Majesty? Uh, are you gonna say anything? Uh... Um... What King Julien is suggesting with his silence is... That I need to talk less and listen more? Uh, sure. Uh, yeah! [chuckles] That's exactly what he's saying. Gosh, I can't believe I didn't think of that sooner. Thank you, Your Highness. - [curtain flutters] - Hm. This might actually work. Next! [sniffs] - [fly buzzing] - Ugh. Hey, a guy with a banana. Come and sit a spell if you like. What's your name, banana guy? My name? [Chuckles] Right. Uh... Yeah! Banana Guy... uh, Mike. Fair warning, Banana Guy Mike, if you came by our watering hole for a drink or a swim... [disgusted groan] King Julien promised to fix it. Yeah, "someday." But we've heard that before from kings. [softly] Snap. The normal lemurs are onto my tricks. It's even worse than I thought. Hm? Forget about that "someday" proclamation! I say the time for action is now! Here's your problem! You've got a clogger. [grunts] Uh, you really shouldn't be up there! Becca's right. You'd better come back down. Oh, right, yeah, because the king is gonna come along "someday" and "fix" this. [crocodile grunts] No, because of the crocodile that lives up there. I'm gonna miss Banana Guy Mike. [gasps] [whimpers] [whimpers] [yells] [whimpers, screams] [splashes] [whimpering] Huh? [yells] That is way better than anything King Julien coulda come up with. Oh, yeah, totally. That guy is the worst! - Hey, who fixed the watering hole? - Banana Guy Mike did! Hey, everybody! Banana Guy Mike fixed the watering hole! [all gasping, chattering] Yes, yes, go ahead, be impressed. [chuckles] Banana Guy Mike gets 'er done. You eyeballing me? Is he eyeballing me? Lady asked you a question! Don't want to talk? Fine! This is about to get real. - [neck cracking] - I hope you're wearing underwear, 'cause you are gonna make a poopy. - What's with you two? - Hey! - I was just walking home. - Oh. You, uh... You weren't going to see King Julien to have your problems solved? Are you kidding me? I love my problems! Might as well tune him up as long as he's here. [grunts] No, please! Please, that tickles! That tickles too much! [grunting continues] Hm... Doo-dah-doo. Last one on the list... Mort! Interrogation. Party of one. - [Mort] Hi. - [gulps] I will be your invasive inquisitor. [laughs maniacally] OK, we've got a family feud that's been going on for ten generations, and... OK, that should be enough to go on. - Oh, I wasn't finished. - What say you, King Julien XIII? Is the king all right? He looks a little... well, not alive. Shh! Shh! - Ah. Yes. Ooh, that is wise. - Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! What's he saying? What would you say to you if you were the king? Oh. Uh, I'd probably tell me to let go of the past and live in the present? That sounds like the kind of smart advice we could all use, doesn't it? All right, don't forget to help yourself to a complimentary lychee on your way out. [Maurice chuckles] Whoo. We make a pretty good team, dummy. Pound it. Hit that rock. Next! - That's everybody. - What do you mean? There is no one left to search. But I couldn't have met with more than half the village. Um, Maurice? What's going on? King Julien said he'd be back in a few minutes, but he's King Julien, so... You let the King leave with no supervision? It's been going pretty great without him. Nobody's noticed this isn't King Julien? [scoffs] Surely everyone's not that dumb. The feet seem different today. This explains my tail twitch. This is the trouble I was sensing. What trouble? I'm really helping folks. Everybody who's come in with problems has left happy. You mean "half of everybody." Which has me wondering where the other half are. But that's not fair! Why have you not told the king about this? We did. He promised he'd fix it... someday. [softly] Snap. These normal people are so depressing. I want to give them all a big hug... but they're so dirty. Banana Guy Mike has an idea. I will speak to the powers that be. They will listen to me. Why will they listen to you? Uh, because... uh... It's not important! What is important is, King Dummy doesn't care about you! [excited chatter] I know, right? Pretty bad, huh? That's what we're up against, lemurs. I say enough talk, it's time for action! [excited chatter] Banana Guy Mike, everybody. Our true leader! We are the Lemur Alliance! Oh, really? I like Lemur Liberation Army. We could be the Lemur Alliance Liberation Army. Or LALA for short, 'cause who has the time? If we all go and tell King Dummy Pants and Maurice we want action, he can't say no to everybody! Who's with me? [crowd chanting] LALA! LALA! LALA! LALA! [grunts] [chanting continues] - [inhaling] - [squeaks] [yelling] We've waited long enough. I'm gonna find him. [Mort sighs] - [crowd chanting] LALA! LALA! LALA! - What is that noise? Judging by the chant, I'm gonna say politically motivated and majorly hostile. [crowd yelling] Loyal LALAs, you know the plan. If I'm not back in five minutes... [screaming] [crashing] [Julien] I'm OK! I'm just badly injured! [cheering] OK. Let her rip! This time at the plane, because that hurt quite a bit! All right, Banana Guy Mike, I've done all the necessary calculations, - and as long as we nail the timing... - Huh? [screams] - [crashing] - Mulligan? [chanting] LALA! LALA! OK! I've got a really good feeling about this one. [nervous chuckle] Don't worry, Banana Guy Mike. This time we got... [shrieks] [Abner] Man, I'm starting to feel a little bad. [Becca] Oh, don't be so hard on yourself, baby. This is not a drill, people. We are in lockdown. - Who is she talking to? - Maybe she has an invisible friend? Nobody panic! I've trained for a variety of lockdown-related scenarios. [Julien screaming] [slow-motion screaming] [grunting] Your reign of terror is over, dummy! [shrieks] LALA! LALA! LALA! [Julien grunting] - [grunting continues] - [crashing] - What are you doing? - Uh, raging against the machine? King Julien, we got trouble. Big time trouble. Oh, yeah, it's probably the bloodthirsty angry mob coming to overthrow the king. Why do you know so much about this angry mob? Wait! You're the one who started this uprising! No, I didn't. Banana Guy Mike did to finally get some justice and... Oh, wow, I started an uprising against myself, didn't I? [moans] This is why I should never be unattended. - Agreed. - Why would you do that?! Hey, you'd be mad at the king, too, if you heard some of the stuff I was saying about me! It's unflattering. [crowd shouting outside] OK, I can handle this. Cooler heads will prevail. We can avoid violence. I'm gonna grab the first one in the door and make an example of him. I'm talking real messy. The rest'll back off. Nobody will be making an example of anyone! I created this problem, so Maurice will handle it. Nope. Sorry. You've used up your "handle it" points for today. You're on your own. [female lemur] You better get up here! [overlapping shouts] [female lemur] Don't be a chicken! - [crowd gasps] - Loyal subjects, please! I decree you guys should chill out. - I think he's right. - Got a point. I mean, he's the king. So we're, like, legally required to chill, right? Is that a requirement? Now, today was my first Resolution Day. And you people turned it into a Revolution Day! Sorry, I was pretty proud of that... that wordplay. Didn't want to squander it. At first, it seemed boring, and all of your problems were hard to, you know, care about. Can't wait to see where he's going with this. But a good king must be able to relate to everybody in the kingdom. I realize that everybody's problems are important... to them. I'm going to try to fix everything I can, even if it'll take hard work and tough decisions, which are two things that I hate. Where's Banana Guy Mike? OK, I have to come clean and make a confession. The truth is... Banana Guy Mike was a fake phony. [all gasp] He wanted to make everyone think the king didn't care about their problems. Which I obviously do, and always have. - Right, but where'd he go? - Uh... Yeah, he, uh... he said he didn't care about you guys the way the king does, so... he bounced. I can't believe we got duped by that Banana Guy Mike. The good news is, from this day forward, I will be a king who listens to his people and does what needs doing. A king of action! Unless I change my mind or get distracted or I'm double-booked that day. Yeah. Firm but fair. I like it. And I already have a thought about my first royal action as the action king. - [dance music playing] - Party time! [crowd cheering] King Julien, please don't let this get out of hand again. Mo-mo, have a little faith in me. Hey, what's everyone standing around for? Let's raise the roof and set this jungle on fire! - [fire whooshing] - [screaming] [music continues in distance] Oh, no. - Is that...? - Banana Guy Mike. He... sacrificed himself. Banana Guy Mike must be avenged! Agreed. How we gonna do that, Becca? We will become an army of two, living in the shadows, striking out against tyranny wherever we may find it. - Did you just make that up? - Yep. Dang, Becca, that's good. I know, right? I'm ready. We will not rest until King Julien is off that throne! [chanting] LALA! LALA! LALA! LALA! - LALA! - [Abner] What's that stand for again? [dance music playing]
