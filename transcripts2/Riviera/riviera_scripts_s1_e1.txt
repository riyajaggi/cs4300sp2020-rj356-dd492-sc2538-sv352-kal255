 - He says he won't see you. - He won't see me? Why not? - Hello. - Hello. What are you doing? I'm watching you sleep. Is that something that you do a lot? From time to time. I didn't know that. Well, that's because... you're asleep. Not any more. You made me breakfast.

 Well, Patrice made you breakfast. But I carried it up the stairs, and I have to tell you, it was extraordinarily heavy. My hero. Unfortunately, I can't join you. I've... got to go to work. What? No. Why? You have to go to work and you have to go to New York. Hey. Thanks for making me breakfast. What is money? What is money? Why do we covet it so? Money, money, money, money. What is money?

 Come on! Sold at three million dollars. Oh, it's been too long. What a nice surprise. Are you well? You want the Malevich. Well, that depends on the price, don't you think? Couldn't you just buy him a vineyard instead? Or a small Pacific island? There is nothing as rigorous as money. Nothing as fluid. Nothing as tensile. Money desires nothing so much as to be itself. Where is money most itself? So, where you gonna hang it? It needs special place. It's very beautiful thing. Argus and Io. Do you know the story? Some god fucked a maiden. Greek kind of thing. Jupiter fucked Io. His wife found out. Everyone fucked everyone then. Money is most itself in the last unregulated great bazaar... the art market, where money can do what God intended-- accumulate. Here, as in Alice's looking glass, a thing costs what some putative free-spending Mad Hatter says it costs. A very exciting bid, ladies and gentlemen. Next, we have lot 12A. - Will he be bidding? - Oh, no, I doubt it. Robert Carver is what we call... a voyeur. You do know the nicest people. From the collection of John Brandeis. We trade Picasso, Rembrandt, Degas, Duchamp. We bundle them the way subprimes are bundled. We sell a Warhol short one day. We hedge an old master the next. We get in there before regulation tames the last Wild West. So, are you convinced? - Him, I don't know. - Araikov. He's a dealer, heavy machinery. Syria, Iraq, Congo, places like that. All the places that need heavy machinery. How do you know all the others? Excuse me. - Hi. - Georgina. - It's up next. - The Malevich? What's my limit again? Did I hear you say Malevich? It's my wife. It's really stunning. I'm telling you, this is like the missing link. Every Russian wants a Malevich. Every oligarch. Just be one second. Where are you? I'm at a friend's house in Nice. Which friends in Nice? Do I know them? Are you still there? Will it take my breath away? - Absolutely. - Wrong. Only you can do that. Why has every redundant stock trader been prowling the galleries? Because they know there is value there. Ungoverned, unregulated... value. Ladies and gentlemen, I shall commence the bidding at $15 million. Fifteen million we have. - We have 16 million. - I bid 16. Sixteen million dollars. When are you coming back? - Twenty million dollars. - It's up to 20. Why don't you come back tonight? You know how badly I sleep alone. Are you even listening to a word I'm saying? What is my limit? It's gonna go to 23. We have $23 million on the floor. Hello? All this drama is bad for my blood pressure. Twenty-five now, ladies and gentlemen, on the floor, against you on the phone, sir. It's like a feeding frenzy. Can we go to 30? Can we go to 30? Tino, sweetheart. I can't hear you. My love, you know I trust you implicitly. - Can I go to 30? - Thirty. Thirty. Thirty million dollars. Thank you. Hello? Hello? Fair warning, at $30 million. Sold at $30 million. Congratulations. Argh. - Horrible. - You used to love these. I didn't know any better. You look great. So do you. - It's been too long. - It has. - One more? - Oh, no. I have to fly back tonight. But won't the private jet wait for madam? You still live in Villefranche. I could give you lift. A lift. Wow. No, thank you. Thank you, but I still have business to attend to here. Yeah, that's probably better. I would have put you in coach. Thanks. Come on. Come on. One more. You're not flying the plane. - All right. Twist my arm. - Great. - Excuse me. Sorry. - Yes, sir? - Two more of these, please. - Sure. Thanks. Hi. You've reached Constantine Clios. I'm not available right now, but if you leave a message, I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Well, sweetheart, Anderton beat us to the punch. Maybe next time answer my calls. Sorry. Never mind. I love you. I'll call you when I land. Talk to me. A yacht. Yes, Major. But whose yacht? Alexei Litvinov. But that's not all. Constantine Clios was also on board. - Clios? Villa Camella? - Yes. Are you sure? Nothing confirmed yet, sir. It's OK. Let's go. Madame Clios. No, no, no. Not again. No. I'm so sorry, Adi. I'm so sorry. Haven't you got work to do? I want you to come home now. I want you to come home now. I want you to come home. Sounds better in French. It's your father. I know. If it's true. Does she know? Where's Christos? Christos, what is going on? Is it Constantine? - Yes. - What happened? Is he all right? What happened? He was on a boat. There was an accident. He's dead. No. No, no. That's not right. Georgina... There's something down there. Can you get closer? She moved. She's alive. It could be the waves. No. She moved. - Georgina. - Adam. What-- - I can't... - It's so hard to take in. Georgie, I missed you. Ada. My mother's here. Here she is. Commissioner. First reports are of some malfunction in the fuel tank. We don't know yet whether it was an accident. Litvinov's yacht sank in the main sea lane. Luckily, there are protocols in place for that. For now, the investigation is in the hands of the Department of Maritime Affairs. We'll step in if the findings show anything other than an accident. Which I'm sure they won't. And the girl? Still unconscious. No ID yet. And the Clios family? It'll look bad if we don't show ourselves. You're right. You should go. Thank you for offering. The body was found by the Police Maritime of the Principality of Monaco. For now, they're keeping it in their hospital. It has been identified through dental records as the body of your husband. No. No, there has to be some mistake. I spoke to him last night. He wasn't on a boat. He was at a friend's house in Nice. Christos, did you talk to him? Did he say anything about a boat? No, but that's not to say he wasn't there. We are 100% sure, madam. It doesn't make sense! As I said before, we are still waiting for the report. I want to see him. I'm not sure this is wise, madam. I will meet you there in an hour. - Christos, we should go too. - Sure. He was burnt, wasn't he? He was close to the impact. I've been told the body suffered significant trauma. I'm not coming. I don't want to see him like that. I want to go see him. Can I go see him? No. He was my dad. I have the right to see him! Don't be so stupid. Of course you're not going. Why? Because he's gonna look like a burnt piece of meat, that's why. - Christos! - Stop it! Both of you! Christos. When you told her, what did she say? Nothing, really. She... didn't want to believe it. None of us do. Did she cry? - No. - Not one tear? No. Why? I thought she would. Her husband just died. Hello? Of course. Hold on. Right. Well, I'm getting the impression that if he wasn't, you wouldn't be considering this. No, I understand. I just want you to think it through. That's all. - I can't. - You can. I want to see him, and I don't want it to be the last time. I know. Stay here with me, Ads. Trust me. You don't want to go. Georgie? She says I'm not allowed to go. No. It's not that you're allowed or not allowed. He's your father. Then I should be there. Is that how you want to remember him? That's not what he would want. I'm going to stay here. OK. Christos, you should go. Yeah. I'll meet you there. It's odd, but I find myself liking what you've done to the house. You can think about that now? I have to think of something. I must leave you in their care from here. You're not coming with us? I shall be waiting. Sorry I'm late. Here. Take my arm. Now? - Oh, my God. - Pardon. Christos. They say marriage ends with divorce. But with a man as vital as Constantine Clios, my ex-husband, nothing ever ends. He was the best of me for many years. And I of him. He lives on in his philanthropy, his charitable work, his art foundation... and his children. Beautifully expressed, my dear. Thank you, Commissioner. If I can do anything to help. Yeah, you can walk me out of here. There's only so much sympathy one can take. You're coming back to the house, Mother? - I think not. - But I need you there. I know you do. You always need me, but not today. It's your home, too. Is it? You can come back for a while, can't you? You've as much right to be there as her. I don't, actually. But I'll be moving back in very soon. There's nothing for her here but the memory of Constantine and when that sours, which it most definitely will, she'll leave. There you are. I came as soon as I heard. Oh, Robert. Hey. I can't sleep in our bedroom. There's too much of him. It's going to be all right. No, it's not going to be all right. It's never going to be all right. OK. OK. We should go back downstairs. Yeah. I should go down first, though, cos you look like shit. There she is. I'll wait for you downstairs, OK? I tracked that down for him. The Louvre owns most of them. Juno Confiding Io To The Care Of Argus, 1660. - How much? - Does it really matter now? My father always wanted the one of Lorraine. Your father? Pardon me, madam, Grigory Litvinov. I, too, am in mourning. Alexei Litvinov was my father. I'll leave you two to talk. Excuse me. So, you know what it feels like. One can't believe it. - That such a terrible thing has happened. - Yeah. You know, it didn't just happen, right? - What? - The explosion. Somebody did it to us. To both of us. Someone very close. What exactly are you saying? That whoever did this thing... could well be here. Don't trust anyone. You came here to tell me this? No, madam, I came to pay my respects. Are you OK? I'm in mourning, remember? They come and go. Christos spends most of his time in London, and Adam lives in Cap d'Antibes. But they consider this their home. And your stepdaughter? She splits her time between her mother's and here. Do you know if your husband was alone when he went to Mr Litvinov's yacht? Why do you ask? A young woman was found, she had been washed in from the sea near Cap-Martin. A young woman? - Dead? - Unconscious. She is in hospital. Do you have any idea who she might be? She was undressed. An escort, you think? How long have you been married? A year. Not long enough, I think, for him to be scouting a younger version. I understand your grief. No, you do not. Excuse me. Can I see her? This young woman? Can I see her? Where is the girl? Hey! Stop! Wait here. Doctor, get in there now! Stop! Police! Stop! How is she, Doctor? The patient has stabilised. Her vitals are good. Can I talk to you? What the hell is going on? Did that guy just try to kill her? - Do you recognise her? - No. Does the name Jakob Negrescu mean anything to you? No. He ferries girls back and forth to the superyachts. Party girls. He used to work for your husband, before your time, as security. Your husband maintained residence in Monaco. No, we live at the Villa Carmela. You know that. So the address, 340 Impasse de Montaigne means nothing to you? What are you saying? Forgive me, madam. I shouldn't have mentioned the apartment. How cute. Thanks for coming. Your speech the other day, it was lovely. - It was important to me. - I couldn't follow it, I have never... been one for public displays of emotion. I'd like to think it wasn't just a public display. No, I didn't mean to be rude. Martini, madam. Merci. Do you know this girl? Who is she? A survivor from the yacht. - A whore? - Possibly. Is that why you asked to see me? Let me see. She's beautiful. Definitely his type. Nothing like you, really. I wasn't his type? Never. And that's what hurt the most. Well, there must have been something he liked. I can't decide, you see, how much you knew about who and what he was. I'm learning. Let me help you then. Ask me a question. Any question. 340 Impasse de Montaigne. Does that address mean anything to you? His pied a terre in Monaco. Or, as some would some have it, his love nest. I had to force the entry codes from him. He took you there? - No. - So, he kept secrets even from you. 12th floor, apartment 195. ID - 44574. The entry code. But maybe he changed it. But you were so trusting, maybe there was no need. Come on. Jesus. Fucking jerk. What do you want? OK. Do you have a problem? Constantine! She's found the apartment. What should I do? I think someone else just came in. You... broke my heart.
