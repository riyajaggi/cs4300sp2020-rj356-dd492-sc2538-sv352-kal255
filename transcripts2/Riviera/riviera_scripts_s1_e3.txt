 You can shoot. I didn't expect that from someone like you. Why come here? I think you were right, about the yacht. That it wasn't an accident. And I think we can help each other, share what we know. I found this in Constantine's things. - I think it says... - Ellena. She's the only survivor from the explosion. Do you know her? I want to know what kind of business my husband did with your father.

 Whatever it was... ..if my father was involved... ..it would have been malignant. I see it in you now... ..that look. What look? Revenge. You're awake. Do you understand me? Do you remember your name? You're in hospital. You've been in a coma since you got here. Stay still. I'm going to call a doctor.

 I need to call the doctor. Oh, you're still using the master bedroom? I can stay where I am. No, no, it's fine, you can have it. Patrice will move my things in the morning. Georgina... I can't imagine what you must be feeling right now, and being stuck in this madhouse won't help. What I'm trying to say, rather... ..inelegantly, is, erm... ..I'm happy you're here. We're not all mad. I know it really seems that way. All the posturing that goes on is just Clios bravado. It's what passes as emotion around here. Well, we don't all feel that way. Some of us actually... feel. Whatever you need, just ask. I'm glad you're here... ..but I'm good. Penny, where have you been hiding? Well, I hope you're free right now, because I'm going to swing by and see you. Well, cancel them. I need to see you. Thank you. Baby, the things I'm going to do when I... Listen, I've got to run. I'll see you in a bit. Did you want something? We need to talk. It can't be easy, right, being the strong one when everything is going to shit. - I don't have time for this. - I want to help. I don't need your help. We need to work together. I barely know you. I think your father was murdered. I need to find out why. Murdered? I just need to get into the safe room. - Unbelievable. - You have no right to stop me! It's a Clios matter. What's in the safe room is our business, not yours. What are you trying to hide? Ever wonder why Dad never gave you the code? He made me promise not to give it to anyone, especially not to... To? What? A gold-digger? Especially not to you. Perhaps Jupiter thought that his wife would discover the truth. Perhaps he wanted her to. Robert? That forger of yours. I need to talk to him. What do you mean, you can't? You can't or you won't? I'm running out of options here. Christos won't give me anything. The level of deception in this family is... I can't trust anyone. My husband is dead. You don't get to decide what I know and what I don't know. All right. Text it to me. Only one of Negrescu's girls would do something like this. All due respect Karim, but not every sex worker belongs to him. Go talk to the girls, ask some questions. I can't vouch for the taste, but it's warm at least. Thank you for being so quick to take up my invitation, Mr Clios. We asked your father along here a year ago. Well, maybe you forgot to include an RSVP. Well, we should get started. There's a great deal to cover. The Brandeis art transactions, the Cayman loans, and various financial instruments that give us cause for concern. Where do you think we should begin? We advise our client not to engage in this line of questioning unless you can provide concrete evidence of some wrongdoing. Otherwise this is a monumental waste of Mr Clios's time. OK, fine. Our people are making good progress with Constantine's money laundering trail, but it will take time, and the longer it takes, the longer the bank stays closed. Once again, we advise our client not to engage in this line of... There are tens of thousands of pages of documents we've requisitioned from your office. Boxes, hundreds of them. Yeah, well, I hope you have a good filing system. Is that what you came here to say? Are you telling me you won't even talk to me about John Brandeis? On behalf of our client, we would suggest that you direct queries on the subject of John Brandeis in the direction of John Brandeis. Or you could show us some evidence. Until then, we will not respond. And this meeting is adjourned. Really is bad. You forged a painting for my husband. No, no, no. I just want to talk. Please. Well? Your work has a certain energy. I'm glad you like it. But I'm afraid I know nothing about your husband or any forged painting. Do you know who I am? I'm Georgina Clios, of the Clios Foundation. I've heard of you, yes. But I haven't heard of you, Lucas... ..Carlsson? Is that why you got into this line of work? Get out. How many paintings did you forge for my husband? I don't have to tell you anything. One word from me and no gallery will touch you. Who do you think you are? Some stuck up bitch, spending money for entitled rich fucks. Sometimes that's true, yes. But success requires talent. Maybe you need to try harder. Get the fuck out of my... You're not going to shoot me. You're gutless. Just like the rest of all the art world phonies around here. You wouldn't know real art if it came falling... OK. OK. Your husband had the copy made for some oligarch to put in his yacht. OK? Really, that's all I know. Hey, Georgie. Hey. I have known Lucas for years. - He trusts me! - You went behind my back with Constantine. - Oh, that was business! - Went behind my back, forged my painting. No. Your husband did that, I simply made the introduction. You make it sound like it was nothing. All right. I'm... I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I should have told you about Carlsson. No more secrets. No more secrets. Do you mean that? Yeah. So, did he... ..tell you anything useful? He says the painting was for Litvinov. But the fake is on my wall, which means the real Lorraine was on that yacht. $15 million at the bottom of the Mediterranean. God, what a waste. What was Constantine doing with Litvinov? Who knows? He had a safe room installed a few months ago. Really? He never told me about it, but I know there's something in there. Yeah? So, what are we waiting for? - I can't get in. - Why not? Fucking Christos. The staff wouldn't dare say a thing. Since when did you care? - Your father might see. - Well, he's not here. He left for work this morning, or something. Wait a minute, you want to see my father? Yeah, I need to talk to him. Oh, my God, that's why you came. Sorry. Hey. Babe. Listen, I will make it up to you. I promise. Will you tell your father that I want to speak to him? That depends. Impress me. No. Absolutely not. That... No fucking way. That's a terrible idea. And even if it works, are you sure you want to open that box? There is something in there that Constantine didn't want me to see, I know it. Exactly, because once you see it, you can't unsee it. Some things are best left alone, Georgina. Robert, you don't understand. I can't sit around and wait for these investigations to be over. I have to get there first. This is the only thing I have that they don't have. I will get the family out of the house, you break into the safe room. I'm sorry, but what part of no fucking way do you not get? Robert, I need to know if I made the worst mistake of my life. And when I get caught? When it goes tits up? Are you going to admit to the family and the police just how crazy you have become? You will be fine. Blue like cornflowers. - Azure blue. - Yves Klein blue. Almost. My father had one of his paintings. I like your hair today. You OK? Yeah, I'm fine. We had breakfast together, all three of us, my brothers and me. And for a moment I thought it was nice, and then I remembered... ..it never was like that. We never sat around a table back then... ..I just imagined we did. Maybe things are better. Yeah. It's not just about power, you have to choose the appropriate serve for the situation. Respond to what your opponent puts in front of you. - Nice. - No, it was poor. I wanted to talk to you about a venture I'm working on. A new private equity fund. You're starting a fund? Sounding out investors at the moment. It's had a lot of interest already. It's a business strategy that offers a great opportunity to generate alpha returns. You would like me to invest? As an early buy in. 1.5 million euros. You would be a priority client. You are bloody joking, of course. No. There's an investigation into Clios Bank, your reputation is shot to shit, and you're asking me to give you money after what Constantine did? The investigation will clear my father of any wrongdoing. That's not what I'm hearing. Tell me, what was it like knowing your father was a crook? Having to carry a secret like that all these years. Quite a burden. - I'm not my father. - No. He was a crook who misjudged his opponents. Serve the same way too many times, it gets predictable. They start to see you coming. Whereas you are merely a deluded loser. Don't ask my daughter for favours again. Hey. What's going on? Are you OK? So, I was thinking... ..what if we all went out for dinner tonight? All of us. - All of us? - Yeah. Yeah, why not? When was the last time we went out? Well, I know it's not the same. And Christos won't even come, he doesn't like you. Oh, he will, eventually. We're going to fix this family, right? Talk it out like grown-ups. Yeah. OK. You wanted to update us. Yes. Unfortunately, I couldn't get Christos Clios to talk. He has an army of lawyers that could drag this out for years, the prick. So myself and the team are pursuing a different line of inquiry - the Clios art collection. We've turned up a number of art transactions relating to a John Brandeis that may be of interest. If you study the data illustrations, you see suggested links between Brandeis and the Clios family. And we get to him via Georgina Clios. You disagree, Commandant Delormes? People died on that boat. Forget your pretty pictures and Georgina Clios. This girl is the key. And you've come up with...? John Brandeis is our man. Getting to Miss Clios is the key. Excuse me. You know, I always had a thing for nurses. Want to make some extra cash? Of course you want to. You should take the night off. Christos, where have you been? Georgina's taking us all out for dinner. She's giving everyone the night off. - Not tonight, I'm busy. - Come on. It's for the good of the family. We've got to get out of the house at some point, show everyone we're pulling together. I said no. If nothing else, it will keep Georgina happy. Adam, I really don't give a fuck about that that bitch's happiness. Don't call her that. You think you're hurting more than the rest of us? Or is it that jumped up execs don't like taking orders? Let me tell you something, little brother, the only reason you got where you are is Daddy, and he's not here any more. Stop it! Just for the sake of one dinner, can't we put our usual bullshit aside? Fine. 9pm. Don't be late. Robert, we're about to leave, you've got three hours. So, how's your novel going? Fine. It's... ..going fine. You mean, you're actually writing something? Christos! Sorry, go ahead. Well, it explores the negative impact of marketization on contemporary human relationships. Sounds great. Yeah, it sounds like a real page turner. Yeah. You know, your dad told me that he used to take you here as kids. Really? Yeah, he did, when mother wanted us out of her hair. Kind of stuffy, you know? Well, Dad liked the wine list. Ha, wine list. That's not why we came. He... He fancied one of the front of house girls. - No way! - Oh, yes. He'd have them set the table, check baby Ada in with his coat. Shut up. Then he would go to one of the private rooms with the girl. - Christos. - No, no, it's OK. I... I want to know these things. Why? Because I'm a masochist. Were there other women like that? I mean, more recently? You mean, since you were married? No, he wasn't having an affair. - I would have noticed. - I don't think so. Christos? Can't we talk about something else? Sure. How about the safe room? - Safe room? - Dad's den. The place he got fitted in the basement. Oh, yeah. Well, Christos has been in there. Christos is the only one who can go in there. He's only one with the code. Yeah. Come to think of it, you use it a lot. - What do you do in there? - Answer the question, Christos. She is head of the family, after all. Head of the family? Mother, you made it. You weren't expecting me. We're all telling Georgina what we know about father. Oh, fun for all the family. More fun than a will reading, in any case. Well, I thought the will reading was great fun. Who doesn't like being threatened by law enforcement? What do you think, Christos? What would you recommend? No, no, something special. Of course, the 73 Romanee-Conti. Very good, sir. 8,000 euros. - Bring it. - Of course. Liquidating what's left of the family assets, then? What? Only the best for us. Well, we do have to be careful. Why come here, then? You could have shopped at Carrefour and cooked as all some hamburgers. Don't fucking decant it, just... You know, this Domaine is overrated. It doesn't warrant this kind of mark-up. I want a fucking discount. You wouldn't have the balls to act like this if Dad was still here. Well, if Dad was still here, I wouldn't need a fucking discount. I want a fucking discount. - L'addition, s'il vous plait. - I want to go home. - L'addition, s'il vous plait. - Can I come with you? Ada, I think it's better if you go home with your mum tonight. No. I want to come with you. Georgie, please let me come with you. OK. OK. I'm very sorry to say, sir, but it is declined. Who's lucky night is it, then? Fuck this place. Fuck you all. - Yeah. - Are you in yet? - No, I need more time. - The meal's over. What?! How long have I got? - They're leaving now. - OK, It'll be OK. Christos, Christos, can I...? Hey. Get out. Sortez. Your mother was grateful for the favour I did her, moving the Negrescu account to Clios Bank when other investors were running scared. Yeah. No, I'm sure she was. That makes us business partners now, and as such I'm going to offer you some partnerly advice. Quit while you're ahead. Yeah, erm... ..I'm not done yet. In fact, since you're so keen to hand out favours, I want to increase the house maximum bet. Favours are for your mother, not for you. Right. You're going to regret that. Really? And why is that? Well, Interpol has frozen all the bank's assets. You haven't heard? Yeah, all that money that you put in... ..good luck getting it all back. - Adriana? - I should have told you I invited Mum. It's OK, really. I'm just sorry it had to go that way. It's not your fault, we're just ..messed up. Every family is messed up in their own way. Not this bad. It was nice of you to try, though. You really didn't have to. - What's your family like? - It was just me and my dad. You don't talk much about your dad. He passed away. I'm sorry. It wasn't easy for him, raising a daughter alone. One time he took me to the Philadelphia Museum of Art and left me there because he couldn't afford a baby-sitter. - Really? - Yes, really. I was 12. But I spent the whole afternoon looking at a Monet, at the most beautiful thing I had ever seen. So, in some ways I guess he gave me my love of art. I'll always be grateful to him for that. Blackjack. The house wins. He's really going for it. He wants to bet his Lamborghini. What do you think we should do? Will you accept? Let him do it. Thanks for the ride. Oh, if you ever want to talk, I'm here. OK, thanks. Is something wrong? No. No, it's just been a long day. How much is he in for? Four hundred and twenty thousand. You sure about this? We could call his mother. Let him go for broke. You're good at this, you know? You should have kids. Can you stay with me until I fall asleep? Sure. Sweet dreams. Thank you. You too. It's way past his bedtime. I'll deal with him. Christos... Hey, what are you doing here? I figured this place might be on the list. - What are you doing? - Well, I'm reviving our fortunes. Chip by chip. Can't you close this down? The wager's legit. You pig. Ah, I need more credit. How did you become vice president of anything? Because he believed in me. Adam... Come on, I know you've got some cash on you. - Come on, bro. - Maybe it's not your night. Come on. Of course it's my night, OK, I know what I'm doing. Get your hands off me, Adam. Oh, fuck, it's her. Is he all right? Sleeping Beauty's going to regret this one in the morning. Off to his hidey-hole. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, you don't. - Get off me! - Christos. Fine. OK, there you go. Oh. Right, well, I'm going to go to bed. Me too. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. You never did have any class. Business is business, Irina. How much is he in for? 600,000. He doesn't have that. What is this really about, Jakob? I know about the asset freeze. So, you're punishing Christos to punish me. No. I'm entitled to be angry. When you took my account, you knew the authorities were coming. - You did. - I didn't know about the investigation. But this is what I do know, I know your investment is safe. And I know the investigation will end because it will get to nowhere. Constantine's dealings were as murky as the sea. They'll never get to the bottom of it. Everything my husband did, everything he said... ..was intended to obscure the truth. To make bad things sound good. In his world... ..up was down, black was white... ..and the bank was merely... ..leverage. But in the end, leverage is just a respectable word for debt. And debt is bad. I'm alive. Should I be dead? I want to meet. Hello, this is Robert. Please leave a message and I'll get back to you. What? What is it? The 600,000. It disappears. All of it. Come here.
