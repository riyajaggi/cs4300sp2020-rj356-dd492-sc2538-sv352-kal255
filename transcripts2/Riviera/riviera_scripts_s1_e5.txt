 Choosing a blind man?! That is the Constantine Clios touch. A blind art dealer? There is no John Brandice. It was just Constantine moving money around. We don't know that, Georgie, we don't know Constantine's side. He wasn't the only one using the safe room. - Christos was, too. - No-one is who they seem, are they? Christos is an addict. Do you think he's capable of this? There is no John Brandice.

 You're right, I have to talk to Christos. Hello? Hi, yes, this is Georgina Clios. I'm here to see Christos. He still isn't here, I'm afraid. Can you tell him again that I'm trying to reach him? Of course. Goodbye. I've collected a witness who needs protection. I'm listening. She was trafficked here. Trafficked for prostitution? She's ready to testify against Negrescu. How many times do we have to discuss this? You can't save every girl in a brothel.

 - For fuck's sake - What do you want? Wait What? Provide her with a safehouse? Who is this girl? All I'm asking... Is that we put her through rehab So she can be a reliable witness in court Rehab? Take her back where you found her. No. No. Fine, take her to St Paul's. No one will find her there. St Paul's? - What's her name? - Fatima. Hey, thanks for meeting me here. Well, I thought we'd better speak face-to-face. - What? What is it? - I checked the Brandice account. - And? - The money, the 30 million. It was in the account until a few days ago. What do you mean? It's gone. - Gone? - Uh-huh. But that means that someone had to take it. After Constantine died. - All of it? - Yes. And if Constantine didn't take it, then...? Christos. He's the only one who had access to it. What do you want to do? I'm gonna get some answers. The whips and nipple clamps are on offer No I'm good thanks. - Is it cash or card? - Cash. Wouldn't want my husband to find out. No, those should go in the back. You take all of those in the back. This is good, good, good. I like all this. Here is the important part. It's like here we want them. This, this is what they see. The rest? Who looks back here? No-one, right? That is where people come in. People see it. No, this is wrong. It's 03, that's not 03. You are pretty, you have a pretty mouth. All the pretty girls in the hallway, you know? And you can come with me. It's good, you look good. What the fuck? It's gonna be a long day. My sources say Elena is staying at The Imperial. Don't be fooled by her appearance. She's killed before. She might have killed everyone on my father's yacht. She's a tough bitch But I think it's going to be fun. No Sophie, I'm not discussing this... I've made my decision No, it's no. That's final. Good, we'll talk later. 'Nadia.' Hello boys Oh, I look awful. Can we try something new? What kind of statement would you like to make? Something that says - "Don't fuck with me." Perfect. Just sprucing up for some marathon schmoozing. Sorry, I'm just looking for an earring. I think you look perfect as you are. Very funny. It's nice. It suits you. Is it new? You don't remember? I was wearing it the night we met - at the opera. Oh, yes, of course. How can I forget? You looked very handsome that night. And I remember thinking, "Wow, my new stepmother is about ten minutes older than me!" Hm... Whatever is going on, whatever trouble he has left us with... ..I'm here. Is it that obvious? You're not alone, you know. It's all so confusing. You smell like him. I feel like him. No, Adam. Oh, hello. - Sophie, you came! - Yeah! My dad is going to kill me. If you see your brother, send him my way. Yes, Mother. Whoa, whoa, whoa, Georgina. Hey, Georgina! Georgina! Aargh! Where the hell is Christos? Someone needs to be in the main room and the hall. Originality thrives in the non-commercial sector. The survival of the elite depends on resistance, on the anti-institution, it is a beautiful symbiosis. We feed off them, commodifying them, using them and then turn up at splendid balls like this. Excuse me. Well, you could have made an effort, Georgie. - Kill me now. - Ha-ha-ha. Hey! Oh, hey. Funny little dress. Such a little bitch, Dom. OK, who wants to get high? That's not very much for three, is it? We can do blowbacks. Blowbacks? What? - Blowbacks. - What is that? - Who's got a light? - I've got a light. Thank you, thank you, thank you for coming, everyone. Thank you for supporting the Foundation. As you all know well, this auction is part of the Clios' heritage and we are so glad to see the same familiar faces every year. Thank you, thank you, thank you... And of course... ..we thank Georgina for the pleasure of this beautiful location, which is very dear to my heart. Let's celebrate our beloved Constantine by having a good time tonight. Adele, leading light of the international opera scene. Georgina? Is everything... Georgie? What is it? Is this live? Oh, my God, you are fucking hard-core. - How long has he been down there? - Not long enough. Adam. The auction is about to start. Cristos hasn't turned up. What an idiot. What is he playing at? You have to run the auction. Me? - Oh, hi. - Yes. Fucking Cristos. Are you serious? Yes. You are the oldest, it has to be a Clios, naturally. That's the way things are done. This night, this gala, it's about the reputation of every one of us. Great. You haven't seen this before. No. This is all very impressive. A vision. Oh, forgive me, I had a few things I had to tie up. Please, not another word. So impressive of you to hold such an event so soon after your terrible loss. - I'm sorry, I hope that... - No, not at all. You look like you could use a top-up. This is the centre of the collection. You will find this in the main room. All the artworks are to be removed and all of them handled with the utmost care. We enter the property at midnight on my command. - Is that clear? - Yes, sir. All right, let's go. Evening. Good evening, everyone. Erm... OK, let's, let's, um, not stand on ceremony, let's... ..jump straight in with, er... ..item number one in your catalogue. A drive around the Circuit de Monaco. Beginning bidding at... ..50,000. Now, don't be shy. Do we see 50 anywhere? 50, do I see 55? 55, I see 55. Do I see 60? Is that 70, sir? 70! Thank you very much. Auctions can be pretty torrid affairs. Yes, I believe the last time you and I saw each other we were both bidding on the Malevich. You won that one, I guess. Have you still got that Mondrian, study with a Composition Number Two? Red and blue, yes, of course. That's one of our favourites. Constantine hung a Rauschenberg next to it and we would talk about the unbroken tradition between the two. Yes, your son was saying a similar thing. Stepson. I didn't realise that you two were close. We were talking about the collection. I was interested, of course. - Sorry? - I was just saying... No matter. Georgina, have you seen Dom and Sophie? - I've lost them. - No, sweetheart, I haven't. I'm sorry, you were interested...? - Are you ready to talk? - You can't do this. - Christos... - You're psychotic. - Maybe. - Give me the bloody key. - First, tell me... - Tell you what? Give me the key. Give me the fucking key! - Christos. - What is it? What do you want? OK, for starters I have Jeffrey Anderton upstairs eyeing up my collection like it's a fucking yard sale. Anderton, is that what this...? Fucking idiot, it's called a valuation, you are insane. - Those are my paintings. - Give me the fucking key. I met John Brandice. - Good for you. - Not really what I expected. Well, who is? Huh? You, for example, no-one had you down as such a cunt. I see. 90,000 euros for this gentleman here. 95! 95,000 euros here. Now, do I see 100,000 euros? Get it out! 100,000 euros? 100,000 euros, sold to the man in the fine spectacles and after - the most coveted soprano in the world! Have you got him to talk yet? It won't be long now. Mrs Clios. We're nearly there? Wait until the service gate is open. Enter the property from both sides. Hello. Are you crying? No. - So, boy trouble? - Not exactly. Why don't you come back to the party? Your brother's doing a very fine job, I just lost out a dance with a beautiful woman. Maybe I could have one with you. No, thank you. Well surely there's something we can do to cheer you up, pretty little thing like you should be enjoying herself. Do you like to get high? - Naughty girl. - I only have this much. But we can do blowbacks. It's been a while since I've heard that. I don't think so. Do you have a light? Oh, sure. I knew I could be of some use. Stupid fucking bitch, you don't know anything. Isn't it time you fucked off, back to Wisconsin or whatever fucking hole you came from. Brandice was a front, obviously. To launder money, right? So, what, your dad didn't think he had enough? The bank was fucked. Dad compartmentalised, he was trying to save the bank. - How? - Fuck. How? Elena. Who is she? You're missing a fantastic party. What are you doing? Relax, Mum. Adriana, go back inside. - Irina, hold on. - Don't, she's a child. I'm not a child! - What are you doing? - What are you doing? Adriana! I'm just trying to be normal for once. God, you ruin everything, it's like you live to fucking embarrass me. You don't need any help with that, whoring yourself. No, because I learned from the very best. You never strike me as the jealous type, Irina. How dare you. What? She was crying, I just sat next to her. She's my daughter. I don't want you anywhere near her. Oh, what makes you so upset? You were never the most scrupulous mother, it doesn't suit you. I think you should leave. I'd like that very much, Jacob. - Leave? - Yes, leave. I'm sorry for our misunderstanding. Beautiful piece of work kindly donated by Lorenzo. With the added bonus that he will personally hand-deliver it to your home! And maybe stay for dinner? Excellent, let's start the bidding at 90. Do I have any advances on 90? Sorry, any advances on 90? Thank you, madame! Do I see 95? Why did you do that? - What? - Dominique. - I didn't do him. - You know what I mean. Well, why'd you come on to that creepy old guy? To get back at you! Sorry. Fuck, I'm so high. You're so beautiful, you don't know what it feels like to be outside of everything. I think you're scared. That under it all - you're boring, like everyone else. 'Sophie's phone, leave a message.' Sophie Get out here now I know you're not a child anymore But while you live with me, you follow my rules. I'm at the service entrance, get here now What the? What are you doing? My job. What are you doing here? My daughter, she's inside. What's happening? Why am I not informed? I have a warrant. We're seizing the Clios collection. Sold! To the gentleman at the back for 200,000 euros, thank you all very much and goodnight! Thank you! Christos. Christos, stop it. Stop it! Fuck. There's water, there's water under the bed, fucking get it! Hurry the fuck up. Check camera 2C Fuck. Help me. Please... Here. Just find a vein. Shhh... Just fucking do it, just fucking do it. Please, come on, come on. Shh. Elena? - Elena. - Who is she? No, it. It's a file. Where is it? Think Panama Papers, international fucking dangerous men, heads of state, Elena isn't fucking around. - Blackmail? - Dirt right up to the Kremlin. Dodgy dealings, corruption, lies... Christos, where is it now? The bottom of the ocean in smithereens, with father and files and lies. What about the bank account? What bank account? The Brandice account, the $30 million, do you have it? I don't have any money. Is there money? I don't know what you're talking about. Where is it? Where's Elena? Adam. Adam... I never meant for any of this to happen. I was trying to save the bank, I was trying to fix it, but Dad made so much mess. I fucking hated him. That's why I hated you. Mr Jukes, the service gate is opening. OK, gents, let's go. - You coming? - Of course I'm coming. Move away. - What's going on? - Madame Clios, by order of Interpol, all the art is seized and you are to stay exactly where you are. Fucking awful night. What doesn't kill you... etc. - Monsieur! - What now? A body sir. There's a body!
