 A witness remarked upon you seemed to be absent for much of the night. Absent from my own gala? Were you? I don't believe so. There was a lot to attend to. Tell me again the last time you saw Antal. I did... I think I recall seeing him early on, when the guests were arriving and... then... nothing.

 How will this look, the family being kept here like this? Anyone would think you had a grudge. Can you think of any reason why someone might want Antal dead? I have no idea. It wouldn't do for anyone to suspect this was something personal, would it? Nothing? As in you saw nothing, or you didn't see Antal for the rest of the night? I was involved with the auction most of the night. I don't recall seeing him again. Is this attack in any way related to our collection being seized? Well, we were hoping you might be able to help us with that, Madame. I wish I could. I wish I could. I'm going to get a coffee.

 Anyone? What the hell happened to you last night? Gentlemen, please. We are still waiting for CCTV footage, but that's her. The girl on the yacht. She has killed twice now, at least. We should take over the case from the Maritime Authority. Yeah. OK. I told you, I'm sorry. I stayed late at the bank, had a few drinks and passed out. I didn't know this was going to happen. That may be the story you told the police, but I don't believe you. This incident changes things. There may be something in what you suggested before, that your husband's death may not have been an accident. That's no good to us now. Antal's dead, isn't he? If you had listened to what I said... She's gone to bed, at least just for a nap. - What about Christos? - Asleep too, I imagine. We have reason to believe that it is the girl we are tracking. Her name is Elena. Elena? Why would she do this? Does this have anything to do with Constantine? We don't know yet. We think she's responsible for a previous homicide, and we have a video that puts her in the scene of your crime, yet no-one seems to have seen anything. What...? I don't feel safe here. I don't think my children are safe. I'll take Ada with me. The boys can stay at a hotel unless new arrangements can be made, or until this monster is caught. I will be placing officers here just in case, and I'll be contacting you. Excuse me. Where is Elena? I didn't get it. What? I know. I will get it, just give me more time. You're dead. Bright and breezy, even after last night's events. Don't you ever sleep? Not if I can help it. Vampiric. I hear there was more drama after I left the party. I hear there was murder most foul. Word gets around quickly. It is a body, Jukes, and not a girl. That's pretty top gossip. - I need more from you. - More what? More information, more evidence. I'm afraid you've squeezed all you can from me. See, if I can't press charges, then I have to release the collection, and that means you won't be buying any of it on the cheap from a closed police station. All right. I believe you might want to have a look in the Principality Art Freeport. Beyond that, I really cannot help you. You are most welcome! I didn't thank you. Irina, there's something else I need to talk to you about. Go on. Christos, he's... He's an addict. You knew? I suspected. It's not the first time. He needs help. It's the stress, the business going under, the funeral, it's... It's just a relapse. He'll snap out of it. Heroin? You don't snap out of heroin. The... Yes, yes, you're quite right. He promised me the last time that...that would be it. So he has a history? He has his troubles. I'd rather not discuss them with you. I'm not judging. No, you don't have children-- you can't. There's a place just past the university. I'd prefer a private facility. State facilities are much more strict. If you put him in a private facility, he'll have himself checked out in a week. We're so lucky you're here, Georgina. Christos. Christos. - Come on. - What? What is it? You're going to rehab, my love. You're fucking kidding me. I'm not, my love. Get up. Did she put you up to this? Christos, your mother and I agreed.... - Agreed what? - Christos... That you'd talk about me when I'm not there? - What did she say? - It's for the best. She's lying, Okay?! It's not what you think. A few lines of coke is not a big deal. - She's had it in for me since she... - It's for the best. Did you see his wrist? Do you think there's more he's not telling me? Uh... We're here, honey. Let's go. Hey, um, can you come over? I'm at my mum's. Christos, I'm going to ask you something, and I don't want you to lie to me. What are those marks on your wrists? I want the truth. No, you don't. Does Georgina know anything about this? Ask her. I'm asking you - I'm still your mother. She's nothing. What is this big secret? It doesn't matter, Okay? It actually doesn't. She wanted something and she got it, so fair fucks to her. What did she want? It doesn't matter. I don't want to hear this right now. You know, you weren't concerned with my wellbeing before. Why do you care so much all of sudden? Oh, Christos... You've never made an intervention in your life. My whole life is a fucking intervention. Do you think it's easy to see you like this? - A fucking junkie... - Yeah. Whose fault is it? Hmm? Who kept pushing and pushing? Who turned a blind eye when I've clearly been snorting everything under the sun for the last three years? I've always treated you like a grown-up. - Yeah, since I was a fucking kid! - Christos! Good job, Mum! You know, I don't even know why you're here. - I really don't. - Oh, Chris... I'm trying. Yeah, well, don't. Christos Clios? Christos. Christos... Follow me, please. Yeah. Yeah, sure. Hello. Hello, is that Georgina Clios's secretary? No, I'm her executive assistant. My name is Brigitta Moss. I'm a legal representative of the Principality Art Freeport. We haven't been able to get hold of Madame Clios and she left your details. We have a duty to inform Madame Clios that a request for a warrant has been lodged with the court. A warrant? Yes, to search the Clios' vault. We have, of course, been less than helpful, but it's Interpol, so I imagine it will only take a few hours. Right. As normal protocol, the warrant will also allow access to inventories, manifests, CCTV, etc. Yes, of course. Well, thanks for letting us know. Fancy one? A small one. Have you slept? Not a wink, even though I'm shattered. I didn't know you had a taste for whisky. I don't. After Negrescu left, I remember us not liking Antal at first. We were just kids. He was really cool. He taught us how to fight. He was trained in martial arts. Christos wanted to be a ninja. Did you see anything? (HE EXHALES) Poor Christos. Yeah, I know. He'll be furious. Was he OK? Not really, but that's the hard bit, isn't it? Adam, do you fancy a walk? Buddy. Oh, come on, Lucas, don't be like that. I apologised for all that business. It's water under the bridge. Maybe you should try having a gun pointed at you by a madwoman. Actually, you make it sound quite sexy. All right, look, the madwoman has had a change of heart. Ever since she met you, she's talked of little else except your work. She wants to buy my work? Very much so. Which one? She's hoping to acquire a set of five, in fact. - Five pieces? - Mm-hmm. She wants you to curate her selection yourself. She's got very specific requirements. Very specific. This woodland goes on for miles. We used to roam it as kids, Christos and I, building dens and stuff. Sorry, was there something you wanted to talk about? I think your father was using me. What do you mean? Christos told me about the trouble that the bank was in. The money-laundering, did you know about that? I knew enough, I suppose. Dad always kept me out of the business side of things. Did you know about Elena? The girl? Whoever that girl is that they're looking for, that's not Elena. Elena's a code name for a file. It went down with the yacht. But it was blown up. I think so. So... why kill and Antal? - What would they be after? - I don't know. That's what I'm trying to figure out. I cannot square the man that I married with everything that I have learned. If he knew that Christos was on heroin, if he knew that dirty money was being laundered through that bank, maybe he never... What? ..loved me. It's like he died twice. Christos, you've got group now, and we'll start you on my therapy. Listen, um, I'm just here to take a break from everything, and rest. I'm happy to do a few group sessions or whatever, but I'm not staying. - Okay? - Okay. No cellphones. I don't have one. I just heard it. Hand it over. If you must know, my company is essentially collapsing, and you're asking me to sit in some circle and talk about my feelings, I need to make some calls. Great. Later. I'll wait for you outside, right? Fuck. - Hey, you. - Hi. Is that everything? After the yacht explosion, the Maritime Division no longer hold any evidence. - Good luck. - Wait. Have the families been contacted about collecting the victims' effects? Ah, not yet. I'm OK. I'm OK. In a weird way, I always felt more at home here than in the villa. There we were Clioses-- here we were just normal kids. It's a lot smaller than I remember. Oh, believe me, I have lived in much smaller and worse, and with more bugs. In New York? Hmm. Do you want to go back? Yeah. I do, actually. Seriously? What is here for me now? Everything is telling me to leave. Why don't we? Let's go. Where would we go? Anywhere. New York, London, anywhere. There's no-one keeping us here. You're sweet, Adam. You've always been really kind to me, even when I know you didn't have to be. You do know I think the world of you. You've been great with Adriana... You can't help it if Christos is a prick and mother is an ice queen. Ha! Do you really think she killed Antal? That girl? She did. I... I saw it. I saw her kill him. What? There is nothing I could do. I was drunk and... It... It was so quick. Why didn't you say anything? I don't know. She was on the yacht with Dad. I... I thought maybe it would be bad for you if I did. I'm so sorry. I would like to go back now. Yeah, of course. Let's not rush things. I can't believe I'm here with Mum. Yeah, at least you have one. Yeah, I guess so. You know, it's kind of her job to be a killjoy. It's so hard to believe. What? Antal's dead. Are you scared? I don't know. I mean, it's so surreal but real at the same time, like I'm in a nightmare and I can't wake up. Ever since Dad died, everyone's gone mad. I'm going nuts. You know you haven't. - You know you're just... - Mental. You're fucking crazy, but that's what I like about you. The gala was weird. Yeah. Everyone turned into strange versions of themselves. I liked that. Want to go to my room? - Yeah. - Yeah? Yeah. - Bonjour. - Bonjour. I have a delivery for the Clios vaults. I'm the artist. Delivery for number 2. Okay. Okay... Christos, would you like to say anything? Anything at all? No. It's Okay, Christos. It's hard at first, but it's really good to just break the ice and say, well, whatever comes into your head. Whatever comes into my head? Okay. Go fuck yourself, I guess. Ignore him. Asshole. Ok Sam, I'm leading this discussion group. If Christos is not ready to speak, we must respect his decision. Just as he must respect this group. Okay? Okay. Thank you. In for a penny, in for a pound. Hello, mum? I'll be back as soon as I can. Can you put him on please? Yes, my love. How are you, sweetheart? What did you do today? Really? I miss you too my love. Yes You'll be good, won't you? No misbehaving, okay? I miss you my little one. Fuck. Kisses my love. So I've tried everything. It doesn't work. Something is missing. Missing a key. A key? It's encrypted. Everything on the hard drive is encoded. If I don't have the key I can't access the content. Where is it? Someone must have it. I half-expected you to be packed by now. You weren't really serious, were you? No. I wasn't. Look, there's something I need to tell you. I wasn't going to because I didn't want to hurt you. Do you understand? The girl from the yacht - the one the police are after. I do know her. You said earlier that you wondered if Dad ever loved you. But I've met her before, once, at Dad's apartment in Monaco. Her name is Nadia. Nadia? I caught them as they were leaving. They were... together. Are you fucking kidding me? I'm sorry. He didn't love you. There's nothing for you here now. You know what? I'm not going anywhere. This is my home now. Don't be stupid. Oh, yeah? Watch me. People are getting killed. You'd risk your life. Yeah. To know the truth, yeah. - You're not thinking straight. - Oh, I've never been more clear. You know that last little shred of hope that I was hanging on to, that he did really love me? That is gone now. No-one fucks me over. No-one. Is Madame Clios here? What's going on? Madame Clios, we'd like to take a look in your vault at the Principality Freeport. OK, but you're going to need a warrant. This is just a courtesy. We don't need you there. All right, just give me a second. Georgina... No, it's OK, thanks. Asshole. What did you say? We all have problems here. Except you, your problem is that you've been dropped off by mummy in a very big car. Isn't life beautiful. It's funny because, um... I paid for your mother once. - Hey. - She was good. - She was cheap. - Hey. Excuse me, excuse me. Can you show me to the nurse's station? Hey. Can you show me the nurse's station? Christos, right? Do you know where it is? It's literally over there. Where? Can you show me, please? Send her my love. I don't know why you need me to show you. - It's there. It's got a sign on it. - I don't. I thought you would beat up that guy. Yeah, well, he deserved it. I've seen enough punching and kicking for a lifetime, and I like it here. It's quiet. Robert? Anderton, will you do me the honour? Well? Anderton. - These are junk. - What do you mean junk? They look pretty good. They're by a local artist. Worthless. His name's Lucas Carlsson. I happen to think he's quite talented. Hold on. These are bank statements. Your husband's account. Georgina Clios, you're under arrest. Wait. - Take her out. - No, hang on. Just hang on a second. Hold on! Wait. Get... Get off of me! Robert! Robert! Look at me! Look at me.
