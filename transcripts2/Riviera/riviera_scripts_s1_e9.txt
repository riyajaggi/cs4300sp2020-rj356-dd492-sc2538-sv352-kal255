 Hey. Start in the kitchen, I haven't looked there yet. We go room by room, tear the place apart if we have to. The Russians think that the key is somewhere in the villa. So all we have to do is find it before they come looking for it, hand it over to them, and I get the hell out of here. And what about the family? Have you told them they're in danger? The family can go fuck themselves. Patrice! You didn't say on the phone, but what did Adam do?

 It doesn't matter. Patrice! It clearly does. I can take care of myself. Madame Clios, how can I help you? I need you to deliver a message to the rest of the staff. Of course, whatever you need. The message is that you're all relieved from your posts. You'll get a generous severance package, but you have to be out by the morning. But Madame Clios, who will look after the house and...? It's not up for discussion. Thank you. It's for their own safety.

 - Georgie, you... - I don't need anyone. - Then what am I doing here? - You don't count. Oh, now, that is charming. Is that a smile or... No, it's not. You'll get a smile when we find that fucking key. Hello. Go for it. - Is she ready? - This is Delphine from the rehab centre. There has been an incident, Fatima was attacked. What are you talking about? By whom? Let me speak to her. I'm afraid you can't. She's gone. She fled with another patient. Gone? We checked the CCTV footage and it appears she was attacked, but managed to escape. I'm very sorry. OK, we can get a taxi from here. Just listen, I still think I need to go on my own. OK. No, listen, it's... It's safer this way. It's me they're after. That's just crazy, where are you going to go? Wait, Fatima, listen. No, just let it go, OK? I'll be fine. No, I know you'll be fine, I won't be. You know, I don't even think about using when I'm with you. So, what, I'm your sponsor? Right, and it's against... It's against so many laws of rehab if you just abandon me right now. It's really bad. Don't abandon me. Please. - I'll think about it. - OK. I have to... Sounds like someone's trying to get your attention. Friend or foe? Does it really make a difference these days? Can I help you? Is this where Christos lives? So someone took him? Yes. You're the one, aren't you? You're the one my son talked about, helping him? Is it your fault, all of this? I think I know who's responsible. What? What is going on? Here you are. English breakfast. It's a cure for everything, I swear by it. I don't need anything. Go on, it'll make you feel better. - How could you be so stupid! - I didn't create this! If you want someone to blame, look at your ex-husband. You know what kind of man you married. Oh, and you were clueless? Just another dumb blonde? The minute you knew about this fucking key, you should have told me. So what? So you could get your face blown off? I was trying to protect you, all of you. It's my job to protect my family. Did they threaten my kids? Yes. Yes, they did. It's customary to knock, Ads. What's the occasion? I'm not really in the mood for company. Tough. 'Hi, this is Christos Clios, please leave me a message.' Christos, please call me back as soon as you get this. He's not going to answer. I know. I have to do something. Adam, I saw you last night. It wasn't how it looked. - Have you asked her? - You're my brother, dickhead! If there's a side to be on, it's yours. I love her. You love her? Adam, she's our stepmum. - Thank you. - Sorry, it's just fucked up. - Adriana? - Yes, Mother? - Are you OK? - Yes, Mother. Where are you? Adam's. And Adam, is he, is he OK? What's the concern? Listen, don't come back to the villa, you or Adam. They think we have a key, something your father left. Who? Some Russians, the big bad wolf, it doesn't matter, just promise me... ..you will stay away. OK. Hello? Delivery for Madame Clios. - Sign here please? - Yes. - Thank you, goodbye. Goodbye. Does it say who it's from? It doesn't have to. It's from Litvinov. This is a declaration of war. 32. The number of teeth an adult has. That's 31 more chances to get to the truth. Please. Please. You know how to stop this. Tell me where the key is. I don't have it. I don't have it. Tell me. Tell me. I don't have your fucking key, OK? I don't fucking have it! Your choice. - Please. - Your choice. Please. Hold his head. No, no, no. Listen to me, listen to me, I don't have it, OK? I don't have it. Please! Please, please, please, no, I don't have it! Commandant Nadia Dubois. She was working for the French General Directorate for Security six years ago. Then it would seem she went freelance. Look at this. What is that? A GPS tracker. Manufactured in Voronezh. Used to keep track of spies working for Russian agencies. It would seem that they have forgotten about her. Our work has been done for us. There is one other thing. Fatima. She was due to testify against Negrescu today. Someone tried to kill her, but she escaped. This is bad news. What would be bad news. Is if she had been killed. - Robert. - Yeah? Do me a favour, take her to your place. She'll be safer there. Georgie, what are you up to? Scratch it and you're a dead man. Fatima, let's get you somewhere safer. So what do you propose we do exactly? We have no power, no pawns, nothing. We tell them the truth. Tell them we don't have the key, and neither does Christos, and then you beg for your son's life. Appeal to his humanity. He's not a man, he's a fucking animal, and he's taken Christos. No, think about it. He doesn't want a dead body on his hands. He certainly doesn't want a dead Clios. And he knows you. Go to him in person, show him some respect. And get your son back. The girl is still alive. She has escaped from the clinic. Which means she can still testify against you. I'll take care of it. It's your problem now. I told you. I'll take care of it. - How did you know he was here? - I was invited. A Riviera wedding this important doesn't happen without an invitation coming my way. Well, you weren't invited to our wedding. Exactly, darling. Are you coming with me? No, no, it has to be one parent to another. - All you have to do is say... - Thank you. I know my lines. Let's greet our newlyweds with applause. Anna and Dimitri. We ask you for a wedding dance. Sasha! Oh, I'm so happy to see you! I was at your piano lesson, remember? The cake looks good, doesn't it? Shh. Forgive me for the intrusion. You have what I want? No, no. But... - Get out, please. - Er... Please, please. Gregory. I am here as a mother. Let my son go. We can't give you what we don't have. If only I believed you, Madame Clios. Now, please... You are ruining my sister's big day. Christos hasn't done anything to you. - He is innocent. - A Clios, innocent? Until one of you starts telling the truth, your beloved son will bear the consequences. Well, your dad asked me to take care of you for a little while. And I was thinking, the adults are going to be talking and talking and boring and boring, and we should just get out of here, right? What about my mommy? Oh, well, she's going to come and tuck you in later, OK? I would so hate for a happy occasion like this to be ruined. Tails of torture... Violence. Murder! Shut your mouth or I'll shut it for you! Tanechka, go dance. This has nothing to do with you. Bitch! Go dance, go dance. Go away, get her away from here. What the hell are you doing? Forgive me friends. Let's move on with the celebration. I'm sorry for that incident. You just signed his death warrant. Irina. Irina! Get in. Hi, are you...? Hello, little man. My name's Robert. - What's yours? - Sasha. Sasha. Litvinov. - What...? - OK, well now the introductions are done, I'll leave you to it. Filthy junkie! You're all gonna die, bastards! You used me. It was necessary. I needed a distraction. It wouldn't have worked otherwise. Abducting a child? It's a new low, even for you. He is not a child. He is a bargaining chip, and one that we can't do without. Don't you understand? You've only made things worse. - He'll kill Christos. - No, he won't. All he wants is his son back safe and well. At whatever cost. If that means releasing Christos, then so be it. And something you'd be wise to remember is that we didn't cross this line, Litvinov did. We're only responding in kind - in language that only a psychopath like him can understand. An eye for an eye. Or a tooth for a tooth. Yes? I asked you politely and in good faith. 'You turned me down and your sister called me a bitch.' So I'm not asking politely any more. Bring Christos to the football stadium tonight. '15 minutes before kick-off, you will get your son back.' Hurt Christos again, or try anything stupid, fuck me around in any way, and you'll see how much of a bitch I can really be. She's the first person... ..who ever me feel like... ..I'm enough as myself. Stupid, I know. No, I get it. All that's done with now. And do you know who I blame? Dad. He did kind of get in there first. Because he always landed on his feet. Whatever he wanted... ..the next minute, it was his. Including her. You get old and he tosses old toys aside and get a new one. The only thing he stuck with was us. You can't say that. OK, he was hardly a model father, but... ..he loved us. I really do believe he did. Of course you do. I was his great disappointment. You can't trade your kids in for a better model. You're just drunk. Hey, guys, here we go, chef's special. Thank you. Capacity is 30,000, so we'll have plenty of witnesses. And weapons aren't allowed anywhere near the stadium, so at least it's a level playing field. - Here we go. - I don't like cheese. You live in France, how could you not like cheese? - It's OK. - No. You are not getting up from this table until every mouthful is gone. Do you understand? Huh? Good. Bon appetit. And I'm the bitch? Adam, what the fuck?! I always wondered why he did it. One sheer moment of pain and everything just fades... Sit down. You know the real tragic thing? All I ever wanted was for Dad to treat me like a real son. Instead of treating me like a little errand boy. The last thing he said to me was... .."Look after this for me." And yet you still have it. It's the last thing he ever gave me. I just can't let it go. She must seem like the Wicked Witch of the West, right? I hate her. I've known Georgie for more years than you've been alive, so I know what she's really like and, honestly, she is so not the wicked witch. I think she's more like the Tin Man. - Really? - Yeah. But she doesn't want it to be that way. She wants her heart back just as badly as he did. What happened to it? Well, uh, a horrible man took it and broke it, and so now she does things and says things that she doesn't really mean. Like with you, tonight. - Do you see? - Can't you get it back? I would, if I could. Go on. - Georgie. - Oh. Thanks. Remember when you first met me? - At the institute? - Yeah. I remember looking at you and thinking, "Wow, "now that girl looks about as shit scared as I do." I was shit scared. I remember walking into that big old building with history staring me in the face and feeling like a total fraud. No, I think anyone worth their salt felt like a fraud in that place. No. I didn't belong there. I don't belong here. I used to think that these people were so much better than me. Because they had... What? But if I could just get a little bit of what they had, it would make me classy. Right? It's bullshit. Look what it's made me. Why are you still here, Robert? Let me tell you something, if I were you, I wouldn't want to be anywhere near me right now. I'm still here because of that girl I first met. The one I think you really are. I'm not that girl any more. I'm so angry. And I'm scared that it's never going to go away. I don't want to be like this. Then don't be. Sasha. Sasha. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. Let's get you home, OK? Come on. I want you to remember this moment. Look at me. Look at me. Get him up. See what you can do about the mess. All right. Let's get you... - Got it? - Yeah. Good. You're going to bring Christos back, right? We will, don't worry. Do not let him go until we have eyes on Christos. - OK? - OK. Where's my boy? Where's my boy? How is Sasha? A lot better than Christos. Oh, my God. I'm here, darling. Hold on. Wait a minute. What I gave you was a fake. And the man who now has it... ..works for certain elements within the Russian government. They'll think you fucked with them. Which is, for you... How do you say in English? Game over. Bring me the key... ..and I make this all go away. Bring me the key. Could you do some research on this file please? - Commissioner? - Yes. Can I see you in my office please? I'm coming. You have no idea how delicately I had to play with him. Getting him to trust me, getting him to open up. And now you jeopardise all that work. You were the only one who knew where Fatima was hiding. You want my job, is that it? I don't give a fuck about you or your job. Negrescu tried to kill my witness. He did kill her sister. My wife. She nearly died because of him. I want Negrescu, and you are going to help me. I think I've had one too many to handle Mother. What happened, did you find your key? 'Christos has been hurt. 'Georgina is driving us to the hospital right now.' What, is he OK? 'He will be. Just get here, darling. 'Both of you.' I'll call us a cab. What key? Earlier, she was rambling about needing a key. Something of Dad's? I don't know. Maybe. What? Give it to Georgina. Tell her I'm sorry. Hey! Oh. - Where's your brother? - He's not coming. Can I go and see Christos? Yes, of course, darling. Go. He looks a lot worse than he actually is. Georgina. Yeah? Thank you. Twice in one day. To what do I owe the honour? I've done the job. I've found the girl you were looking for. This is the one, right? Which girl? The girl you were looking for. There is something I am wondering. Have you included anyone else in our little investigation? No. I understood this was between us. Yes. This was my understanding too. Good. I have something for you. Fuck, shit! Drop you gun. - Drop your gun! - It's good, it's good, it's good. Are you OK? What a surprise. You aside, there is nothing I despise more than rats. But if you don't deal with them... ..they can quickly become a problem. Goodnight gentlemen. Goodnight asshole! Fatima. He did like you, you know. Who? Constantine. It was me. I'm the reason that we lost touch for so long. Georgie, you don't have to do... Just let me finish. I thought I didn't need you. I mean, I thought that I didn't need my past. - I'm sorry. I thought... - It's... It's OK. We're OK. Georgie, I almost forgot, I've got something for you. From Adam. - From Adam? - Yes. He thinks it might be the key. I cannot believe it. After all this time, Adam? Maybe you can finally put a stop to all this. Do you remember where you parked my car? Do you know, I can't rightly remember. - That's old age for you. - I'll have you know I'm in my prime. I'll try this way. - Georgie. - What?
