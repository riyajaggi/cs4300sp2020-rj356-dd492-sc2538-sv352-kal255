 You have blood on your face. Do you have any idea who did this? Whatever this is, whatever you're mixed up in, if you have any chance at all... ..walk away. Sir. Please. There's a lady in a state of shock, over here. Hello. Oh, my God, Georgie, I thought you were dead. I'm OK.

 We are at the hospital. Mum is taking Christos home. Where are you? - Robert is dead. - What? Georgie, come home with us, please. - Tell everyone I'm safe. - Georgie. - Did you get through? - Yes. Robert's dead. Get in the taxi, call Adam, tell him to come home. Now. There's not enough room in the ambulance, you go with your sister in the cab. Jakob, I need your help. Robert! Who are these guys? It's Jakob's men. There'll be more tomorrow. Just keep patrolling.

 Send another two to search the house. - That's good work. - What about the girl? No. This is more important now. I'll call you. Gentlemen. Patrol the area. Hey. Mm. Are you OK? - Yeah? - Yeah. Have I kept you from something? No, no. No, you're my only priority, my love. They're here. The men who killed my sister and chased me, they're here. - What? Tell Negrescu. - No. Shit. Shit, OK. Erm... - No, no. You can't. - We need to get you out of here. No, no, they're everywhere, they're all over the villa, they have guns. - Do they know you're here? - I don't know. I don't... Hey, listen. Listen, I'm not gonna let anyone hurt you, OK? I promise. It's OK. It's OK. - I was worried. - Are you alone? How did you know I was here? I didn't. It was just one of the number of places I checked. Did you tell anyone? Does anyone else know that you're here? No. No-one knows. - Where are you going? - I'm gonna put an end to this. I didn't know the bracelet was important. I swear, if I'd known... ..I'd have given it to you sooner. And then, maybe... ..maybe Robert... I'm so sorry. It wouldn't have mattered. The hard drive was a fake. The one that I gave Nadia, the one that Litvinov gave me, he didn't want Nadia's people to have Elena. He wants it for himself. That's why he needs the key. And he knew that that would make whoever has it give it up. I just gave him an excuse to want me dead. Instead, he got Robert. So what are you gonna do? When to buyers want the same piece, who wins? The dealer. Georgina, I have Dad's money. The 30 million from the sale. I thought the money was the least he owed me, but it's yours, take it, go. Clearly, he planned to. Please. You owe this family nothing. You can't fight them on your own. I won't be on my own. - Hi, Jakob. - Hey, Adriana. - Want some? - No, thank you. You used to work here, didn't you? Yeah, I did. Well, before you were born. Why did you leave? Things change. Were you and Mum close? She was the boss' wife, I see her every day. We were familiar. Was she pretty back then? Yeah, she was. Elegant and kind, mostly like she is now. Kind? No. I should get back to work. Do you have any children? I... I do have a daughter. What's she like? Why do you ask these questions, Adriana? Why do you avoid the answers? So? What's she like? She's bright... ..and funny. Beautiful. She's very... ..very special... ..to me. You should bring her around. I really should get going. Negrescu murdered my sister. Who was to testify against him. What? He'll kill her if he finds her here, he's already tried once. But then... ..go to the police if you believe all this to be true. There's no safety with the police. God. Do you know what kind of man Negrescu is? I do. And that's why he's perfect for our protection. Not hers, obviously. I don't even know who she is. Well, I do. Mum, please. He'll kill her. He will kill her. As long as you stay in this room, you're safe. I will let you know when there's a window for you to leave. - Thank you. - After that, you're on your own. And you go alone. Are you sure Litvinov will come? Are you afraid I'm gonna let them kill you? You have the key? - Is that it? - Yes. Looks like I was entertaining the wrong Clios. How's your brother? You should smile, Mrs Clios. I've done you a favour. Don't tell me to smile. Neither your husband's death, nor my father's shall have been in vain. Does it work? How's it going there? Da. So we're good? Yeah. You're just going to give it to them? They're gonna take it. You will help them... And in return, they're gonna make you suffer. Why? Because you murdered my best friend, you fucking piece of shit. You... You really think it was me? It's all done You coward! They killed your husband, your friend. If you give them what you want, you're a fucking coward. You coward! You fucking coward! You could have told me what you had planned. Georgie! Georgie! Are we save? Are you coming back home? The greatest threat to the Clios family is once again the Clios family. And Litvinov? If he isn't dead by now, he'll be wishing he was. I've never been in here. You're not missing much. What did he keep in here? Secrets. This family could build a whole new villa out of those. She was responsible for the explosion on the yacht. What? You can't recognise her from the news, but that's her. I recognise her, I only saw her once at a party, but she was there with Adam. - 'Ms Robbins.' - 'Mr Clios.' Is this it? Yes, I thought it would be perfect for your collection. I wanted something... When I looked at it, I wanted something that would help me escape to another world. This is just another Greek myth. It's Roman, actually. You think I'm missing something. I think you're missing everything. Every myth has been painted a thousand times, yes, but that's what makes them special. It's how the painter chooses to retell the story that makes it interesting. This is the myth of Jupiter and Io from Ovid's Metamorphoses Jupiter seduces Io, the beautiful, young daughter of Inachus. And then he transforms her into a cow, to conceal her from his wife, Juno. But Juno's not easily fooled. She places Io in the care of Argos. Of all the scenes from that story, that's the one Lorraine chose, Juno confiding Io to the care of Argos. It's not just beautiful, it's fascinating. Hm. Well... No matter how well concealed a man's secret, his wife will always find out the truth. I wouldn't call that well-concealed. It's in an open field. Hidden in plain sight. I think that Jupiter underestimated his wife. Perhaps Jupiter knew that his wife would discover the truth... Perhaps he wanted her to. 'Georgina.' Sorry, do you want to be alone? No. Actually...I want to ask you something. You said that Nadia was having an affair with Constantine. Yes. She told me she wasn't. I'm sure I would, too. Facing you down, you're quite terrifying. Adriana said the same thing. She said that you were with Nadia. She saw you at a party. Why are you asking this? Is it true? Was she with you? You need to understand something about your late husband. If there was no chance of being caught, it wouldn't be as much fun. He'd bring Nadia and others, beforehand, to family things, events, so he could fuck them at his convenience. And I would be the cover. Pretend they were mine. He expected me to... Demanded that I do that for him. He had a phrase, "Hidden in plain sight". I wish it was a lie, Georgie, I do. Get out! Get out. Get out! Your middle name is Marjorie? I have my grandmother to thank for that. So you're saying there's no gallery with that name in all of Nice? The Riviera? OK. Thank you. Starting route guidance. I talked to Adriana this morning. - Did you? - Yeah. I'd like to see more of her. She is my only family, I'd like to take care of her and you. Yes. Yes, you're right. We need to take better care of our families. Maybe we should tell her. She's old enough, she has the right to know. I'll think about it. OK. I'll just go and tell my boys to clear off. Bye, dear. I heard a peculiar rumour this morning. About a Syrian girl who was killed. Irina. You know what I am. And you know what I would do and not do. Where did you hear this from? From the girl's sister, Fatima. She's in Christos' room - down the corridor. I think he's in love with her, so he's blind. She's dangerous. If you want to take care of this family, maybe you should start there. Mum? Fuck. Go. Christos? What the fuck are you doing? She's in there. You've reached the voicemail of Commandant Delormes. Please leaves a message. Get your hands off me! Fatima! Get off me! What the fuck's going on here? - Stop it! - Out of the way. Get off! Adam, they're gonna fucking kill her. Go! Stop it! Stop it! Take care of her. Don't move! Don't move! Get out! Get the fuck out. - You're under arrest. - Yeah, on what charge? What the fuck you think, asshole. Are you OK? That's not my car. Fuck. You sure you're OK? We are gonna need you to make that statement now. - Of course. - You ready? 'It's OK. I'm so sorry.' You whore. Get out of my house. I said... get the fuck out of my house. What is it you think I've done? You fucking told him. You picked him over your own family again, your rancid fucking pimp. Yes, I told him! I also told the police. That bitch would never have been safe as long as he was free... ..so I laid a trap. And I did it for you. I've saved you... ..time and again, Christos. The only reason you live... ..the only reason you live... ..to lead this family is because of me! Speak to me like that again... ..I may not save you next time. You have reached your destination. 'My beautiful Georgie.' 'Lorraine, where it all began. 'Where we began. 'Begin with me again, my love. 'My Juno. I love you, 'always and forever... '..your Constantine.' You all right? Your text was, erm, oblique. You know, after all we've been through today, I thought, fuck it, let's just go for a little trip. Now? Yeah, the sea air will do us some good. Here, give me a hand. I never thought I'd set foot in a boat again. Thank you for this, Georgina. No problem. I want to show you something. I always suspected he may try and run from everything. I suppose it is comforting knowing that he planned on taking you with him. Not really. "I'm gonna implicate you in all my crimes but don't worry, "I will get you out of it." It is not really that comforting. It proves he loved you, though, doesn't it? You wanted to show me this, why? Because... Because I thought that maybe... ..we should get out of here, you and me. We know people who can make Constantine's passport yours and you have his money. What is stopping us? All we have to do is never turn back. It takes nothing. There's... I don't... I can't. Why not? You said I owe the family nothing. Neither do you. I just need to understand why. I thought this was what you wanted. Georgina, it's my fault he's gone! You were right, Dad was never with Nadia. I thought Nadia and I were in love. She told me that Dad had something that people she worked for wanted. I did not know what it was but I knew if I told her where the deal was taking place, I could humiliate him. I wanted that, I wanted to hurt him. So I told her he'd be on the yacht that night. I thought they would arrest him. I never thought they would... I can't leave my family now. I did this to them. To you. I love you, Georgina. I always have. We were the same. I'm sorry. Thank you. For telling me the truth. I knew that when I called you, I just wanted to hear you say it. I lost everything because of you. I doubted the only man I ever loved in my whole life. Your dad was right, you are pathetic. He saw right through you and so do I. You are weak. You are nothing! And I am nothing like you!
