 Please. Please! I told you, the wife, she must have Elena. Georgina. Georgina! - Morning. - Morning. Mmm. You've moved the Gauguin. Yeah. I think it looks better there. - What do you think? - Yeah, I suppose it does. It catches the light. Exactly.

 - Hmm. - Where do you want this? Bottom of the stairs. OK... I'll move that later. Let's put the Lorrain down here in a corner somewhere. OK. What about these? Oh. Those are your dad's. I'll find somewhere appropriate for them. Later. I should have left. I'm going out today. - Where to? I just thought I would treat myself. Quite right. - I'm so sorry for the wait. - Oh, no. Not at all. There.

 Please. - Very good. So much tension. - Yeah. But you've been through so much. Tell me, do you know Place Massena? - Who are you? - Do not raise your voice, Mishka. - You will regret it. - What do you want? Please. Please. Shh. You have something that does not belong to you. - Elena. - No, that is at the bottom of the sea. It survived. And someone removed it from the police station. - We believe that someone was you. - No, it wasn't! No matter. At 3pm tomorrow, you will meet me at the fountain and give it to me. - But I can't-- - Or I will kill someone close to you. Why should I believe you? Why, indeed? Why should you die for the sins of your husband? Why should Adriana, Christos, or your dear friend Robert? Please believe me, I do not exaggerate when I say I know where each of them are right now. There are eyes all over the city, and all I have to do is give the word. It would be a shame if I had to kill innocent people. 3pm, at the fountain. Very good. Don't move. Hello! Adriana? Dom! You're back! - Dom! - Go away. Come on. I've called you a million times. Didn't you get my messages? OK, I'm sorry. I don't even really remember what happened. - No shit. - Dom, what did I do to you? I think you've done enough. - I just got out of hospital. - I didn't know. Yeah. I don't care about you and Sophie being... you know together, or whatever. But those guys were taking advantage. I don't think they were. Don't you know what guys like those are like? Jesus Christ, Adriana! Wake up. You're not a kid any more. The way they look at you. And you... You're just asking for it. But why would they hurt you? - It was Negrescu. - What?! No, he wouldn't do that! - Are you kidding? - What do you mean? What?! Nothing. It's a mistake. He wouldn't do that. My God, how are you so naive? Adriana! Your mother was fucking him when he worked here. Everyone in the house knew it. Everyone. What are you talking about? - Are you OK? - I'm fine. I just... The way he behaved, it was like he was playing with me. He threatened Adriana and Christos, all of us. OK. - I need to go to Litvinov. - Do you think that's wise? Somebody took it from the police station. It had to have been him. Trust me, if Litvinov has what we need, I'll make sure he gives it to me. Negrescu. Salut. What are you doing here? She could have died. She was right to leave. I could not stop it because of you, you son of a bitch. I'm going to kill him. If you carry on like this I can't do anything for you anymore. You don't have the balls to do anything. My witness is ready. Is she clean? Yes. Give me your agreement. Ok. But rest, take a few days. Seriously. Okay. Where are you staying? I'm sorry about Isobel. OK? Your turn. Excuse me. Madame Clios. - Your son? - Yes. Music lessons. Important for the soul. Please. Not that it isn't always a great pleasure, but what can I do for you, Georgina? It's time for all this to be over. I heard about your security man. It was that girl. The Russian girl from the yacht. I heard. What else have you heard? That the investigation moves slowly. That some... Tried to do you harm, but you put him in his place. That's great. You're learning. I was approached today. Approached by who? A Russian man. I couldn't see much more than that. I came here because we share an enemy. And I want them to stop. What did he want? The girl in rehab, Fatima. Here's the address. I won't be able to keep my men from you if it turns out you had anything to do with Delormes' assault. Don't worry, Commissioner. You won't find anything. I don't know if you're aware, but the debris from the yacht has been returned. - To you? - Yes. There is something. A hard drive. - It's encrypted. - Well, then, that's it. That's what they want. That's Elena. The question is, what should we do? No. No question, Grigory. We give it back to them. - Why? - Why not? It's not going to do you any good now. Your father is dead. My husband is dead. End this once and for all. Give it to me. I'll return it to them tomorrow. Perhaps. No perhaps. I give it back to them, or I tell them where it is. - Your choice. - My man will do it. No, he said only me, or people will get hurt. OK. But we will come with you. These people are ruthless. We must have no more blood spilt. Agreed? - And nobody else must know. - OK. Agreed. Hey. How are you? - Is everything all right? - Oh, yeah, totally! Antal was murdered, Dad's dead. Oh, wait, the man who pretended to be my dad. - What? - Haven't you heard? I thought everyone knew. Mum was shagging that gangster who runs the casino - and used to work here. - Negrescu? The one and only. Or should I say, Daddy Negrescu. That's... Who's been saying that?! It's hilarious, right? Right?! When did he even work here? 17, 18 years ago? It's the funniest thing ever. And everyone knows the punch line is me. That's... Lying bunch of fake fucks. But the least I know I'm a Clios of some sort, right? Completely dysfunctional. She's already in the centre? Yes. At St Paul's. Perfect. What have you got on her? Are you sure she'll do it? She'll do it. She is... Influenceable. I can always count on you, Huc. Fatima, right? Fatima, that's right. You look better. - Are they good to you here? - M-hm. Good. And how are you? I'm...OK. We've been summoned to make the statement tomorrow. - Tomorrow? - Yes. - You are ready? - Yes. Good. If we do this, we're safe, right? It's the only way. Are you OK? Is Dom here? Gone home. - Is he OK? - He looks like a punch bag. What if it's true? He's a monster. Maybe you should just ask her. Yeah. You know, I never thought I would say this, but I'm starting to quite like the coffee here. - I still miss espresso. - You're an espresso girl? - M-hm. Small and strong. - Aha, just like you. Wow, that was so cheese. - Cheesy. - Yes, cheesy. Yeah, thanks. OK, so, plan for tomorrow, shall we go on the hunt for real espresso? I'm on a day release tomorrow. Really? How come? I'm making a statement about my sister for the police. I'm not supposed to talk about it. OK. And you are OK with everything? Yeah. I'm good, actually. For the first time in a long time. Good. - Them? - Her. She doesn't like me. How are the voices today? Have they calmed down? I'm sorry my poor Petra. This should help. Remember what I told you. She is dangerous. Take care of yourself. - Lost your key? - I threw it away. Sorry? I threw it away, I'm not coming back here! Do you want to come in? Did you shag that man Negrescu? Or do I come out and talk to you like this? Did you? That's preposterous, why would I have anything to do with...? Years ago, years and years and years ago. - What is this? - He beat up Dominique. - Why? - You tell me. Sophie, what's...? What's going on? I don't know, Dominique had to go to the hospital and... we were at his club, Negrescu's club. You went to his club? I told you to stay away from him and you go to his club. Adriana? Adriana! Did you sleep with him? This is nonsense. You're lying. You're fucking lying! I'm sorry. When I was 15 years old I wasn't exactly... I mean I had girlfriends but I wasn't confident. You know, I wasn't sporty. My mother kept pointing it out, little remarks. I built up a bit of an attitude, that helped, but... I still wasn't exactly, you know, shaping up to be the son that she wanted. One day this girl starts talking to me and she's... beautiful. I can't believe she's interested but she's laughing at all of my jokes. We go back to mine, we have sex. It felt amazing...and real. A few months later, I see her in a club and... I hadn't heard from her so I go over and say, "Hey, I missed you," or something, but she's acting really weird. Her friends are laughing. I realise they're laughing at me. It turns out she's a prostitute. Yeah, it turns out someone paid for her to sleep with me to make me more of a man. What a thoughtful mum, right? I mean I can't work it out. Does that mean she loves me? I hated the prostitute. It never occurred to me to hate my mum. Look, these were the same people that killed your father. I'm putting an end to it. I just wish you'd let me come with you. - I can stay out of sight. - I have protection. Besides if they see you, they'll kill you. If they see that, they'll kill you. You're right. Wait for me. Don't lecture me about single parenthood. I just saw the girls, I know they are here. Adriana? Adriana! Adriana! - Could you come with me, please? - No. - Adriana... - I don't want to. - I won't ask you again. - What are you going to do? Call the cops? Sophie, go inside. - What? I haven't done anything. - Come on, come on. I'm sorry. Tell me the truth. I was unfaithful to your father. We both were near the end. Our marriage was broken, darling. I am so sorry for that. But... you must believe me when I tell you not Jacob Negrescu. That old rumour has been going around the villa staff for aeons, but it's not true! I thought you'd credit me with a little more class! - How did you know I was here? - Sophie. Don't be upset, she was worried about you. - You've been hurting yourself. - I haven't. We're fine, really, Mum. Well, good, I'm grateful to her, she's a good girl. She's the best. You like her? I'm happy someone makes you happy. I'll call you. Leave the call running and I'll have it in my bag, that way you can hear everything that's going on. OK. So this is it? - Elena? - Yes, it is. All this trouble for something so small. Perhaps we should have given her the real hard drive. - They will kill her. - By the time they see it is a fake, we will have followed them. She will be safe. Fuck. Shit. - Nadia? - Yes. It's her, isn't it? The girl from the boat? - Yes. - Was it you? Did you blow up the boat? Yes, I did it. Can you make a shot from here? No. I have to be closer. What happened to Constantine? - Did he die? - Yes. - He was on the boat. - Were you sleeping with him? Is this important to you? I have what you want, I just need to know. No, I didn't know your husband that way. Where's the key? - Where is the key? - What key? It doesn't work without a key. - I don't have a key. - Someone will see me. - I can't believe this. - Nadia. - He's going to kill us. - What? Who? OK, OK, look. Tell me what it looks like, I can help you find it. You were searching for it, right, at the house? I can help you. I'll search the house, the bank. For fuck's sake! Nikolai, I believe her, she can help us. Tell him it's OK. Tell him I will help you. Please. Please, I want to see my son again. Bring Mrs. Clios to me now. - Thank you. We're OK? - Yes, yes. - We are OK now? - We must go. Come. Georgina! Come on! Go, go. - It's OK. It's all over. - They killed her. I know. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! They executed her! - Georgina. - What happened to the case? Stay calm. They said that they would kill us all if we didn't give it to them. - We have to go back, we have to go back. - No, we don't. Right now we do nothing. OK, it's OK. Whoa, whoa, whoa. ... Get off her! Are you OK? The voices! I had to do it! I had the voices on me! Bullshit! Stop. Stop! - Who knew you were here? - She's just crazy. - No, no, Fatima, who knew? - No-one, just... Just the policeman. - Then you can't trust them. - I do trust them, he's a good man. No, he's not. Let me out! OK, we need to go. Let me out! Let me out! - Could you buzz us out, please? - No. Sorry about this. But what are you doing? Stop. Stop it. What are you doing? Thanks. Come back. I understand Adriana visited your club. - Yes. - You should have told me. You're right, I apologise. Some piece of shit was trying it on with her. As I understand it, he was a friend of hers and he was badly beaten. Well, you can't blame me for being protective. She doesn't need your protection. What is it, Irina? Hmm? Have you said something to her? You must tell me if you have. No. I haven't said a word. And I'm not going to. Look Irina, I've been doing some thinking. If we are going to do this, we are going to do this properly. And if I'm helping you get everything back that's yours... I want to get back what's mine. You. How are you feeling? I can't stop seeing it every time I close my eyes. It's OK. It's OK to be afraid. I'm not. At least she's gone now. She killed my husband. She got what she deserved. You're right. She's gone and we're here. Nadia's dead, there is nothing to be afraid of now, we're free. It's just you and me. - What? - It's OK. I'm here now. - No. - I'm here. - Adam, we talked about this. - Stop! Whatever it is that you're feeling it's a mistake. It's not a mistake. It is a mistake and I don't feel the same way. You're lying to yourself or you're lying to me. - I'm not, I haven't. - I saved your life. - Hey! - Why do you do this? Look, Adam, you are my stepson. Stop saying that! OK, give me two seconds. OK. - Oh, get the pink ones I like. - OK. - If you just give me a chance. - Get...! - Georgina. - Get off! I love you. You are fucking with my head. - Get off me! - I thought you were going to die today! I love you. - That was quick. - Just drive. Drive. Let's go. What the fuck did you do that for? You're just like the rest of them. You think that you can just take whatever you want. Well, you can't. This family is a cancer, it is poisoned at the root! You sick entitled fuck!
