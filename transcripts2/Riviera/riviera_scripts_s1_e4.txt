 - Yes? - Why not? I've been trying to pin you down for quite some time. - I'm flattered. - Well, I mean, every time I see you, you're bidding on some artwork that I want. Except that I never get to beat you. That does not stop you from trying. I gamble on other people's ignorance. Not everybody understands the value of what's for sale, and sometimes you get lucky. So, this is a... - This is your passion? - Is that a surprise?

 No, it's just that, you know, art in the Riviera is a financial investment. It's men finding more ways to make more money. Oh, but you're different, right? Not as different as you. He won't see me. Why not? - What's your ambition? - I want to own my own collection. And you weren't born into it, you didn't inherit it, it's just you. - It is an obstacle. - No, you are young and very good, and your competitors are old and rich. You are our worst nightmare. Crazy bastard. Look, it's how they do things around here. Breaking and entering, Riviera style. Using a sedative gas is more efficient than hitting people over the head.

 What were you thinking? I mean, it could have gone wrong. Badly wrong. But it didn't, did it? And you got what you wanted. So, you had a look around? Yeah. I might have had a peek. Nice drug stash. - Do you think Constantine knew? - No. No, there's no way. Though that does explain how Christos has been acting lately. I also found something you may not have seen. What's all this? My entire life. You been here all night? Here, take this. - You look like you need it. - Thanks. So, how's it going? Fine. What is it about this case that has got you so hot under the collar? Come with me. This is Bello. Have you met? Bello earns 12,000 euros a year. 12,000. And somehow he supports three children and seven grandchildren. He buys food, toys, pays his mortgage. He even manages to take his wife out for a meal once a month. And all the while Bello pays a percentage of everything he earns, 2,000 euros, to the state, to the nation. But the Clioses of this world, they get away with paying almost nothing. And every penny in tax they don't pay is taken away from Bello's hospitals, his schools, his police service. Look at him. Here he is toiling away in the bowels of society and paying his fair share. Where are they? Well, most of Constantine Clios is in pieces at the bottom of the sea, but I take your point. His wife, his entire family are still living on the proceeds of his corruption. I thought you were only after the bank. I'm after all of them. Everyone who steals money from me, from Bello, even from you. Georgina Ryland, class of '97. I've never even seen my birth certificate. Fingerprints, our marriage license, medical records. My mother's death certificate. - Why do you think he did this? - He never asked me for any of it. Your middle name is Marjorie? I have my grandmother to thank for that. There's also this. Bank statements. I never knew about those bank accounts. There must be thousands of transactions here. All for tiny amounts. From the Cayman Islands, Liechtenstein, the Bahamas. There is a pattern, here. Look, look. The payments build up over a month until the total reaches several million, and then the entire amount is transferred out of the bank. See? Balance drops to zero. A few months later... an even larger amount is transferred back in. And these transactions go to and from... Jon Brandeis. I do know what that money was for. There. The Picasso? I bought that. $27 million, a record sale. The seller? Jon Brandeis. The Rubens? We sold that to Jon Brandeis. The Gaugin, the Schiele, all bought or sold at Constantine's request, to or from Jon Brandeis. Dukes was right. They were laundering money on a massive scale. And I was helping them. He used me, Robert. He never loved me. I was just... useful to him. My marriage was a sham. A fucking...sham. Back so soon? I thought you might be taking stock. I want my car back. I should ban you for your own good. Like you're going to do that. You think throwing your car keys onto the table makes you some bigshot? Nobody wants some miserable car junkie crying on their shoulder, and I'm not sure I want one for a partner. Listen, just because we're taking your dirty money doesn't make us partners. As you wish. But you know what they say, never gamble more than you can afford to lose. That's not fun, right? You don't gamble to win money. It's the risk of losing everything, that's the thrill. Spare me the pep talk. How about an IOU? The debt is 600,000. No-one ever walked out of this casino with an IOU. No-one. So why should I take one from you? Your mother... paid your debt for you. You can pick up your car keys at the office. I hear your mother runs your bank now. I've come to take you to lunch. Irina, you should have called. Come back in five minutes please. It's a surprise. We can't. Not here. - Your place is free. - We can't. It's us. We need to cool things down. I'm sorry. Why? Why?! You're the ex-wife of a possibly murdered billionaire having an affair with the chief investigator. What do you think? Not to mention this whole financial scandal with Dukes. - What about the girls? They're friends. - I'll talk to Sophie. So, this is it? Is this what you want? What I want is not to lose my job over a scandal I can avoid. You're a small man, Jean. In all the ways that matter. Your mum's kind of hot. - If you say so. - It's not up for discussion. She's stunning. I can see what my dad sees in her. If you like her so much, go fuck her. - She slept with a girl once. - Really? Yeah, she told me, she fucked some actress when she was younger. - She told you that? - She tells me everything. Oh, my mother barely speaks to me. - Lucky you. - Yeah, I guess. So, are you going to do it? - Do what? - Get with my mum. No. What do you think of Dominic? He's kind of hot. I'm grooming him. Oh, can you groom someone who is older? Sure, why not? - Want to smoke weed? - Fuck yeah! Do you remember that number you wrote on me? 15072014? That was the day that Constantine and I met. Nobody would ever know that but us. I saw it and for a second I thought... maybe he is still alive, maybe it's some sort of message. And I remembered the man who loved me. What sort of sick fuck uses his wife like that? It doesn't look good, but... let's think about it for a moment. None of those transactions actually implicate you. They implicate Constantine and Jon Brandeis. Maybe he had to go into hiding to protect himself and protect you, but he left evidence that you weren't complicit in a place that he knew only you would find. Georgie, maybe... He's dead. Maybe he deserves to be. Murdered by the same drug dealers and war criminals that he was helping. But how do I know? How can I ever know? Well, there's one man you could ask. Jon Brandeis. Irina. This is a surprise. I'm here to see Ada. Do I need an appointment? Of course not. - Where is she? - Playing with the gardener and that awful girl who is always following her around. Are you staying long? Would you like a drink? A juice? What is this? Saudi Arabia? I'll have a martini. I know you don't give a shit about girls like us, but I'm telling you the truth. OK, if you can just take a seat... I already told you, I cannot wait. If they see I'm gone, I'm dead. When the duty officer arrives... - Please, just remember, Amira Sayed. - Okay. Amira Sayed. Commandant? I've been looking for you. - They've found a body. - Wait, I'll be with you in a minute. Is everything ok? Oh yes. Just a prostitute looking for her sister. Who has supposedly disappeared and is a prostitute too. Disappeared... Where was she last seen? I have no idea. Another Negrescu girl. - Come on, I'll take you there. - Thank you This is actually a very good martini. Were you once a barmaid? Thanks. Yeah, I used to make cocktails at a bar in New York. It was good money. It's always good to have something to fall back on. You must be stressed, with the police investigation? I've got nothing to hide. But none of us are on firm ground. Your marriage through this Dukes microscope will seem very convenient. - There was no convenience. - Of course. Love's dream. So, no skeletons in your closet? No. It must be nice to be the innocent one. I understand that it must be difficult for you to have another woman living in your home with your children... but there's only so many insults I can take before lunch. Georgina, I'm sorry. I've come to ask you a favour. His name is Louis Follet. We've arrested him before for soliciting. - How long has he been here? - We don't know that yet. Why even bother hosting a gala? Tradition. We always used to have it here. Constantine and I would host it together. The children would be allowed to stay for an hour and then be taken to bed. You'd always see them, like little birds, perched in line at the top of the stairs, peering down. Adam used to send down Christos to steal canapes. Who are you thinking of inviting? Bored people and guilty people. Then why do you host them? Because I'm both guilty and bored. I could think of a few names I would like to add to the guest list. - Anyone in particular? - A business associate of Constantine's. Jon Brandeis. Do you know him? No, actually. - But the more the merrier. - Of course. - Who is it? - I am here to see Grigory Litvinov. He's not here. Tell him his life is in danger. Drink? No. Suit yourself. So, who wants to kill me? The girl that survived the explosion. Do you know her? Look around you. There are so many girls that come and go. Did you know this girl attacked a nurse and killed a man that gave her a ride? No. She's either very scared of someone... or she's fucking ruthless. If she is involved in the explosion, then who's to say you are not on the same list as your father? This all sounds like a grand fuck up on your part for not arresting her when you had the chance. I am not going to make any more mistakes. Hi. There are not both for me. I'm entertaining. She's outside. Look, you're welcome to join us if you're at a loose end. You don't have to pity me, Adam. I didn't think I was. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be rude, I... It's just I've been feeling more and more like a widow these days, and not much else. I don't like it. You know, you learn so much more about people after they're dead than when they were alive. I'll let you get back to, erm... Natascha. Well, you're welcome to join us. I mean it. It does no good sitting here on your own here dwelling on things. Trust me. Sun, gin, swim. That's a remedy. Thank you. No. Maybe in a second. All right. I could never pity you, Georgina. She's new. What happened to the last one? Who could remember? Hello, yes, I'm calling from the Clios Art foundation. We have a vault with you. Yes, thank you. In light of his recent passing, I'm going to need to come down and review the collection. OK. So, what do I need to bring again? I'll bring some ID, a copy of my passport... marriage license, our certificate of incorporation. Yes, yes, I've got all that. Great. How does first thing tomorrow morning sound? Great. Wonderful, thank you. Do you want a drink? Yeah. Why not? Thanks. You want to choose which girl brings it over? Can I look? Go for it. It's 200 euros. Ah, yes of course. Hello. - English? - Mm hm. - What's your name? - Cherie. Do you want to party? Yeah. Please stop, I don't want to do anything. I'm just here to talk. You want me to talk dirty? No. I'm a policeman. I saw you at the police station this morning. The girl you're looking for. Is she still missing? Yes, my sister. You recognise her? - No, I'm sorry. - She may be in danger too. If you help me find my sister, I can ask the girls. Maybe one of them knows her. Wouldn't that get you in trouble? It might. My sister? She was sent to a private party a week ago and never came back. OK. I'll see what I can find out. - Where was the party? - I don't know. Do you have a picture of her? You don't need one. Just take a good look at me. She's my twin. - Hello? - It's me. Why don't you put that thing down? If I wanted you dead... - you'd be dead. - You were meant to give me more time. - These things happen. - Not to me. Why are you acting so fucking rattled? It makes you look weak. Put it down. Ugh! Argh! What were you thinking? You forget who you are working for? - Wait. - I have no choice. Elena is still out there. I know where. How? I heard them talking. - Who? - On the yacht. The father. He had the sense to split it. Only half of it was destroyed. - And where's other half? - I think it's in the house. I'm the one who fucked it. I will put it back together. Be sure that you do. It is worth more than you. Or I. Ow! Argh! What the fuck is that? Insurance. Just a little tracker. You know, it would be terrible if me and you were to lose each other. It's like Fort Knox in here. It is far more secure. Mrs Clios? I would shake your hand if the computer would permit it. And it finally does. - Welcome. - Mr. Schneider. This is my secretary. Executive assistant, actually. This way, please. Artwork that doesn't leave the free port is exempt from all tax and customs duties. Art sales conducted within these walls can be considered tax free. Due to this, we hold many of the most expensive paintings in the world. You've probably witnessed their sales at New York and London's most prestigious - auction houses. - I probably bid on them. Yet, here, a sale merely involves the movement of a canvas from one vault to the next. It is almost comical. If not a little bit tragic. That may be true. Like most things, it depends on one's perspective. This is the Clios vault now. I'll leave you here so you can view in privacy. Discretion is our modus operandi. Come back to reception when you're done. Thank you. There's not much in here. Georgie, this looks like the real deal. But these don't belong to me. They belong to Jon Brandeis. I should know, I sold them to him. Well, what are they doing locked in a vault belonging to Constantine? What's this? The details of a bank account. Jon Brandeis. His passport. - There's no address. - Look, a lottery ticket. Piazza Grande. From a lottery booth across the border. Christos Clios. - What are you doing here? - I heard you were in town, though rumour has it you hate Monaco. A rumour is a circulated story of questionable truth. My disdain for Monaco is fact, a fact that I do my utmost to remind people of at every juncture. Could we talk in private? Of course. Excuse me. I'm so sorry. Your father. My most sincere condolences. - It's fine. - No, it's not fine. - Do they know what happened? - No, not yet. It's been difficult. Lawyers, litigation, freeing up my father's estate. That's why I'm here. In light of what's happened... The Clios collection is coveted. Yes, it is. And expensive. And even for these vulgarians, 400 million is not a steal. Let's not be too stuck on the collection as a whole. Will Georgina not be upset? No. No, she and I would accept offers on single items and be reasonable. Reasonable? Make some sales. We need to sell some paintings. And let's keep this between us. Don't want to create too much noise and start a frenzy. This is the girl we found by the train station. Fuck, fuck, fuck. - What is it? You found her? - Put this on. - Why? - We're leaving. We have to get you out of here. - You found her, didn't you? - We have to get you out of here first, then we can discuss this somewhere safe. Oh, my God. No, you need to tell me. They found her. Next to the train station. She had overdosed. - I'm sorry. - But she didn't even use. She didn't take anything, even when they said it would help. - She was the strong one. - Please, we have to get you out of here before they do the same thing to you. Let them. Negrescu is evil. Listen, if you want me to catch the man who did this to your sister, then you must come with me now. Whoa! Hello. I'm fine. Now? What makes you think I have the time? I don't like surprises. That is the investor who was threatening to pull out of the Clios bank. Frederic Dumont. The one you asked me to look into. Luckily for us, he's got a wife and kids, and my guess is he wants to keep it that way. - So...? - When do we show him the pictures? Go. Now look there. There. This is my favourite bit. So, do I get a kiss? Maybe. We're having a gala at the villa for the foundation. I'd like you to be there. All right. When do we pay him a visit? He's got my number. Oh, and he's very efficient. Hello? Who am I? Just a helpful friend. They've frozen my personal account as well as the business account. How the fuck am I supposed to live? - I can lend you a card. - Well, I don't want Mummy's credit card, I want my fucking life back. I think with the way you're acting at the moment, not having access to money might not be such a bad idea. If you've come here to lecture me, just... - What? - A friend of mine discovered an awkward situation with one of your investors. - And...? - Fortunately, this friend spoke to this investor and reassured him that because he's a business associate of yours... his little indiscretion would be forgotten. As long as he's in business with me, he's safe? Something along those lines. Huh. Is that a smile? I've not seen you smile for a while. So, once all this has blown over, we won't need Negrescu's account any more. Why do you think the investor changed his mind? Yes. Ah! Aren't you supposed to be good with your hands? What's going on? We lost one. The twin. It was a cop. Oh, sorry. - Adam? - Georgina, hi. Is now a bad time? I thought maybe we could go for a drink. Um, it's not actually a good time. - Is everything OK? - Yeah, yeah, of course. I just... - Adam, are you there? - Yeah. Sorry, don't worry. I'll see you later. It doesn't look like the kind of place a billionaire would call home. He must have left this ticket for a reason. Maybe he won. Maybe it's a winning ticket and he was too embarrassed to collect it. I am not embarrassed. I think that means no. You know, it could have been worse. How could it be worse? You could have had children. Maybe I was wrong, Georgie, maybe there was no message after all. I've found him. I've found Jon Brandeis. My love, you know I'd trust you implicitly. You know how badly I sleep alone. Everything I have is yours, hidden in plain sight. Georgina, I love you and I always will.
