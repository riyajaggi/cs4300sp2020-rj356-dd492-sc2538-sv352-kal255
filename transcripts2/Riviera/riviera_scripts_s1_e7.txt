 I know what you're trying to do! Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it! Cold night. Localised power cut, I'm afraid. I'm sorry about that. It seems there was a bureaucratic oversight, and they forgot to return your clothes after you were searched. Here we are. Can I ask someone to fetch you a coffee? Well, you'll want to phone your family, of course. - Adam... - Hello?

 - Irina. - Yes, Georgina. Is everything all right? I've been arrested. Darling, what a nightmare. It was Jukes, I can't get hold of my lawyer, I've been here all night. I'll get a lawyer down there right away. The very best. Stay strong. - What's going on? - Jukes arrested Georgina. - What?! - She spent last night in a cell. We need to get down to the station. That will only make things worse. I'll arrange representation. Anyway, we promised we'd see Christos. Go see Christos, if you want. I'm going to the station.

 Constantine's off-book art market transactions all involve Brandeis. Now we have bank statements. - It's building to a strong case. - Against Brandeis, perhaps. - Not enough to charge her. - I haven't interrogated her yet. And you will not, Jukes. Put your efforts into catching Brandeis, but you can't go after people like her just because they piss you off. A strip search? For fraud? It was all done perfectly correctly by a female officer. And playing games in the night? Yes, I've heard. - She could sue us for that. - Look, she's tired, she's strung out. - If I talk to her now... - Let her go. And walk carefully, Jukes. Remember, you have no authority here without my approval. Let's go. Are you all right? I came as soon as I heard. You're out, now. That's the important thing. Yeah. They arrested her, can you believe it? - I wonder if she's out yet. - Who did you put on it? - No-one. - No-one? I was getting round to it. Of course, it's possible they do have something on her. None of us really know how involved she was in Constantine's business, - do we? - She's one of us. Really? Listen. I know I was a pain last time you visited, and I'm sorry. I was going through a hard time, but it's better now. And besides, there's someone here who's really helping me. - Who? - Just a friend. Yeah, right. That's wonderful, of course. Feeling better? Do you know what I was thinking about, in that cell? No. My father. He ripped people off a thousand ways, and I was part of the con. He used me. It made him seem more wholesome to have a little girl. I came all the way to Europe to get away from him. But there I was, sitting in a jail cell. Just like him. Jukes should never have done that to you. Jukes? This one's on Constantine. Constantine did this to me. He did it to all of us, in a way. Well, I'm going to do something about it. - Thanks for the tea. - Where are you going? I'm going to get some answers. Hey, Georgie. Do you want to... The vault, that statement wasn't there before yesterday, you planted it. Yes, there was a good reason. You wanted to get me arrested and take my paintings. I know it looks bad, but it wasn't like that. OK. So where are they? Remember, I know what you do, Robert. Why don't you come inside and I'll show you? When I heard about the warrant, I knew I had to do something about the Brandeis paintings. - You switched them? - No, not quite. There wasn't much time. I didn't want to pin them too securely... ..in case I damaged the paintings underneath. But I needed to throw them off your scent, and so I left the bank statements as a smoking gun... ..so that they wouldn't look at the paintings too closely. Your Schiele. I couldn't just walk out of the vault with them, so I decided to hide them. You see, I was trying to lay a trail to Brandeis, and shift attention away from you. That was smart. And it worked. So, do you think you can trust me again? I'm sorry. It was a bad night. You have no idea how humiliating that was for me. I'm sorry, Georgie. I didn't think Jukes would arrest you, I had no idea he'd got that far. If we don't stop him, that's going to be the next few years of my life. What do you want to do? The only way to get me out of this mess, is to make sure that Brandeis takes the fall. So we make him real. But then what? Is that going to work? Yes. Listen, if Brandeis donates a painting, it'll cause a stir. Art world recluse turns up to gallery unveiling, it'll be all over the papers. Jukes sees his photo, is on his trail, and leaves us alone. Are you sure you want to sacrifice the Schiele to the cause? It's a lot of money to lose, it's worth millions. - I could help you sell it. - Robert, breathe. It'll be worth it. But what about one of the other works? No, it has to be that one. I know that Sonya Roche is dying to get her hands on a Schiele. All right. Do you speak Italian? - I'm afraid I don't. - Then let's hope he speaks French. Let's use the Hotel King Philippe. Oh, he'll love that. Mr Luigi. Yes. Excuse me. When was the last time you took a holiday? We have a proposition for you. - Hello. - Hi. Well, actually, Sonya, Mr Brandeis is a great admirer of the work you're doing here at the gallery, and so he wanted to donate the Schiele. We would consider that an extraordinarily generous gesture. Follow me. You'll forgive the formality, Robert, but you never can tell these days. Between you and me, Sonya, Mr Brandeis is looking to get a bit more recognition for his philanthropy. A public unveiling would be perfect. I'd be happy to discuss that with him directly. Mr Brandeis has designated me his intermediary. Pardon me for being blunt, Robert, but you're a fringe operator with a certain reputation. I wouldn't invite you to a party, why would Brandeis? He has his peculiarities. I have to warn you, Sonya, Mr Brandeis has attached two requirements to the donation. I am one. And the other is that the unveiling needs to happen tomorrow afternoon. And, I'm afraid, it's take it or leave it. How'd it go? She nibbled, just as you predicted. Are you still coming out to this old place? Or is it happy memories of Constantine? Constantine hated it. It belonged to my parents. They didn't come from money. I used to love it as a child. Constantine never could understand it. I suppose some small part of me wanted to hold on to what life was before him. Is that why you used to bring me here? Perhaps you reminded me of life before him, too. An old house, that's me now. You've gone up in the world. Not as much as you. I'm rapidly falling back to nothing. - Come on. - It's true. The kids, they don't need me any more. The only thing in my life that's always here for me is this place. Irina, self-pity doesn't really suit you. You should do something, you should get the Villa Carmela back. Oh, you think it's that simple? She'll never give it back, not the villa, not the art, not my daughter. Why'd you invite me here? No, truly. Why am I here? I never brought Adriana here. Do you know why? No. I think she was conceived upstairs. What do you mean? I want my life back. You have to help me. It's lovely to see you. Just look straight down there. See you later. - Sonya! - Hi, Sonya. I knew you'd come. - Jukes. - Anderton. Looks like Brandeis is in town at Gallery Roche. He's unveiling a donation, some sort of impromptu thing. My invitation arrived this morning. - I'm here now. - Right. Mme Roche. Mr Brandeis, such a pleasure to meet you, and to be able to thank you for your wonderful donation. Christophe, ici! May I? Here we are. Our pleasure. Schiele, such expressive use of line. It's absolutely perfect in the space, would you agree? Georgina! Oh, darling! Oh, it's so good to see you back in the thick of things again. Absolutely awful, what happened. How traitorous to take your collection. Unbelievable, what you're going through. Thank you. If there was anything at all I can do? - Shit. - Are you all right? Excuse me. Gentlemen, it's time to go. - Now, yes, now. - Excuse us. Robert, what are you doing? I'm sorry, but I was just... Get Carlsson out the side entrance, and see if you can delay Jukes. - But Jukes isn't... - Police, quiet, everyone! - Silence! - John Brandeis. - I'm looking for John Brandeis. - Lucas, it's Robert. They're on their way. We know he's here. Brandeis. Then I will take the name, address and identification of everyone in this room. You, downstairs. Upstairs. Get that camera out of my face! - Andiamo, yes. - Si, ma dove, dove? Fuck, fuck, fuck fuck! Hold this. OK... Here we go. You don't have a light, do you? What the hell do you think you're doing? Brandeis. John Brandeis. He donated the Schiele painting. - Where is he? - Mr Brandeis, he isn't here. Apparently not. Then I think we can assume he has left. Oh, quelle surprise! Meet with Brandeis, did you? I came to an unveiling, just like everyone else. Well, I was invited. Oh, are you Anderton's plus one? That's sweet. He's checking the provenance of your collection for me. Boss. We tracked him to Hotel King Philippe. Good work. Squad, with me. He's not here. Let's go. Let's go. You could stay for a drink. Hm? Litvinov is here to see you. He's waiting for you. OK. Ah, our guest! Looking for a private game? As it happens, I'm here to talk business. There's something I want. And I think you can get it for me. What is it? Constantine Clios' hard drive. It contains sensitive information, but now it is locked up in a PlayStation. I have my own problems with the police right now. Delormes? You're well-informed, my friend. Perhaps together, we can resolve my problem and yours. Excuse me. Officer Jukes, Interpol, Mr John Brandeis, please. Brandeis, Mr John Brandeis, open the door. Police! Police! Boss. Have a look at this. - Brazil. Call the airport, now. - Yes, sir. - Monsieur. Telephone copy. - Thank you. There you are. They are saying flight left on schedule 45 minutes ago. Looks like he's gone. Shit. Uh-huh. Yeah. Uh-huh. Great. So he made his flight. Then we did it. I wonder what he's thinking. How he managed to get away with it for so long. What are you doing in here anyway? I thought since the room wasn't being used anymore I could take it over. Pick up my book again. Trouble is, I'm not sure if I can work with him disapproving over my shoulder. Then he goes. You sure? Yeah. - Here. - Yes, I've seen it. What the fuck you think you were doing? Storming like that into a gallery as if it was some terrorist cell. I had reason to believe... - You overreached yourself. - Look, we're that close. There is no extradition where Brandeis went. - So we talk to the Brazilians! - It's over, Jukes. If you want to keep investigating Constantine Clios, you'd better find another angle, or find another job. Boss. Call Georgina Clios. - Hello. - Hey. Adriana. Morning. - Jacob. - Yes, it's me. I haven't seen you since the gala. Mm-hm. Would you like to come to my club tonight? I'll get it. - Hello! - Hello, Madam. - Karim Delormes? - Yes. A signature please. There you go. Thank you. - It's heavy. - Yes, I know! Have a good day, madam. Thanks. Bye. Karim, there's a parcel for you. I need to check this out for court. Sign there. We are live at the scene of the explosion. It is difficult to determine the exact number of deaths and injuries. As you can see behind me, the emergency teams are currently intervening. The police said it was too early to rule out the possibility of a terrorist attack. Investigations are underway. We will come back to you as soon as we have more information. Thank you. What's that? That's my mum's when she married my dad. Oh, no, try it on. No, I can't. You cannot. Come on, Adriana. You're going to look great in this. No! Come on, do it. OK, honey. Great. Come on. OK. What are we doing tonight? I want to have some fun. Well, there's somewhere I think I can get us into. - Yes? - Special invitations. And it's this older guy's place. - Insane man. - What older guy? You'll meet him, it'll be fun. Yeah, better be. OK. Mum. What are you doing? I'm... I'm sorry, we were just messing around. - It was my fault, Madame Clios. - No, I wanted to put it on. Sophie's being loyal. Do I look like you? I mean, when you married dad. Yes. Very young. We got lucky, huh? We're alive. Negrescu did this. When I get my hands on him I'll destroy him. I promise you, he's going to pay for this. I promise. Yes. Yes, my love. Leave me. Go away. What are you saying? I don't want to see you ever again, Karim. Go away! Go away! Go back to your fucking Negrescu! Go away! Go away! Go away! Go away! Go away!!! Enough now! You played me. I have no idea what you're talking about. I was meant to go charging into the gallery, wasn't I? And Brandeis, what, sneaks out the back into a waiting car? Leaves the country with a false passport and flies straight back with a real one? Oh, wow, you must be imagining him sitting in some cafe in Nice laughing his ass off reading about your fuck-up in the paper. You know about the false passport then. Just a guess. I suppose I shouldn't be surprised, given your origins. The investigation into the bank will be ongoing. Anything else? We've decided not to pursue charges against you for the time being, although if any fresh evidence presents itself... You can go. What is it? The collection, my paintings, I want them returned. - In due course. - Immediately. Or perhaps you'd rather I sue for mistreatment. You can keep the Lorraine, it's a fake anyway. Brandeis screwed us too. - What? - Didn't Geoffrey notice? He always did have a terrible eye. Hang it on your wall, if you like. It'll be returned along with the rest. Fine. Now you can go. God, I thought you said it wouldn't be a problem. I'm trying, I've texted him, he hasn't answered yet. - OK, we should go and... - No, I told him to meet us here. Adriana! Actually your mother has forbidden me from seeing you, so... Well, you know her, she's just overprotective sometimes. And besides, I'm old enough to handle myself. So I see. Anything you want, you ask. Anything. Thanks. Anything we want! Shut up, OK? - He's your genie. - Genie? He grants you a wish and all you have to do is rub his lamp. - I told you, it's not like that. - Uh-huh. Oh, thanks. Is something up? No. Just thought you might want to celebrate. Come on in. We should take him for a ride more often. We absolutely should. To him. Are we OK? - What do you mean? - I mean... - Are we OK? - Yeah, of course we are. We didn't even toast to Jukes, the bastard. The bastard. God, I wish we could have seen his face. And to Egon Schiele. And his expressive use of line. She... - Adam. - Celebrating something? Every day is an escapade. I think I've mentioned Robert before. We met at the Institute. - Pleased to meet you. - Yes, me too. Georgina has mentioned you, I think. Come on, join us. Well, it's getting late, so I thought maybe I should be heading off. Oh, OK. Oh, nice to meet you. Bye, Georgie. You both have a great night. Hey, you! What the fuck, man? Come on! We've got to go. OK. No worries. We have to go. No, he's being a fucking arsehole, right. He deserved to be thrown out. It's our night. Don't let him ruin it. Fuck. I can't believe he's out of my life. Dad? No. Jukes. Well. I've got something I've got to do. - Georgina? - Yeah. When the book's done, I'm going to dedicate it to you.
