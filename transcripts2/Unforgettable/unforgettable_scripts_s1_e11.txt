 Hey, what are you doing? I'm telling the ward nurse! I'm telling the ward nurse! Whoa, nice bail. You totally nutted that. I hit something. Yeah, a pile of you-suck. What the hell? Must have schralped yourself good. No, it's not me. We gotta get out of here. Is there anything creepier than an empty mental hospital? - A full one. - How long has this place been closed?

 A dozen years, at least. There was some kind of investigation. Psychiatrist running the place was an actual lunatic. - Doctor-- - Dr. Helen Mostow. You a fan of the creepy too, huh? No, her name's still on the directory out front. Rumour is there's a mass grave buried under the basement... ...but Dr. Helen disappeared before anybody could ask her about it. Time of death? The MLI said around midnight. - Appropriate. - Clean edges on that wound. So we're probably looking for a knife or at least a manufactured blade. No broken bottles or torn metal. I'll tell the boys in blue. I found this in a room down the hall. Vic is Peter Suderman. According to his licence, he was 42 and a partner at Spirit Trekkers, Inc.

 - A ghost hunter? - Yeah, looks like. Find out if Inc. means there are other people in the office. - Stay out of my room. - I'm really-- - You're not supposed to be here. - Step aside. Nurse said only me and the nurses can be in my room. Nurse said. Nurse-- This is Gordon. He lives here. I think he's lived here since before they closed the place down. And this is his room. Okay. Let me.... - Hi, Gordon. Hey. - No. I'm Carrie. It's okay, it's okay. I'm one of the new nurses here. Did you take your pills today, Gordon? - No. - No? Well, I have an idea. Why don't we go into your room just for a minute... ...we'll settle you in, and you'll be ready when the cart comes, all right? - Okay. - No one else. Just me. Right this way. It's right.... Well.... I like your collections, Gordon. - Well, it's okay if I keep things. - Of course. Sorry I didn't have a chance to make the bed. I didn't know.... I have all these things going on. All this.... That's why I built this. All this mail belongs to the staff. They haven't picked it up in a long time. And this is my mail. I'd been sorting it before you came in, and it-- So I heard it was pretty busy here last night. They shouldn't let kids in the hospital! I-- I agree with you. I agree with you, Gordon. I agree with you. I actually have two people out there telling them right now. - No more kids in the hospital. - Okay. Did anything else happen here last night? Happen? Only Dr. Helen. - And she was angry. I keep telling-- - Dr. Helen? She's here every night. Walks up and down the halls with a black stick. She blinds you with it. That's what she does. Gordon, there was a man. He was attacked here last night. She's wicked fast. She jabs you with her stick. Sucks your brains right through your eyes and-- It's okay. She's not here right now, okay? Gordon. All right, you wait right here for me. - Okay. - Okay. Thanks. He see something? Yeah, but he's never gonna think it's anyone but Helen Mostow. I say we find the calmest EMT we can, get him over to Queens Hospital Centre. All right, well, I'll take care of him. Take a look at this. Whoever did this wasn't interested in his equipment. This is what you call a thermal-imaging camera. Standard tool of the ghost-hunting trade. As anybody who watches the Discovery Channel would know... ...ghosts give off heat just like people. - Probably didn't know that, did you? - What do you got for us, Scooby? Looks like our vic was in the middle of recording something. The guy heat-sensed his own murder. The camera represents thermal energy by converting it... ...to the colour scale we know-- Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, whatever. --with the red spectrum calibrated to be consistent... ...with the heat emitted by a human body... ...or, in this case, a spectral entity or a spirit. Tanya, can you turn that into a person? Not a recognisable person. I would say a fairly distinct blob is what we could hope for. But your dead guy did have a digital recorder in his pocket, voice-activated. He was pushing the low end, so I did some basic EQ work. - And...? - I have audio. It's not synced to the visual, but.... Well, listen for yourselves. - Sounds like a sneeze. - Can you do any better? I thought you'd never ask. Denny, is that you? Denny, is that you? Finding Denny would be your job, but I will keep working on the footage... - ...and see what else I can get out of it. - Thanks, Tanya. - Really good to be back. - You have fun with the feds? Totally. The digital evidence lab they have down there is ill. - Well, we missed you. - You did? - I mean, you did? - Yeah. I mean, how are we supposed to tell a mega from a pixel without you, right? Guys. Happy ghost hunting. - "You did?" - Yeah, what? It's purely professional, guys. Come on. All right, so who's Denny? A ghost of somebody that was killed in the hospital? Or a living person who may have killed Peter Suderman. - You don't believe in ghosts. - My family's from New Orleans. - Place is crawling with ghosts. - Ever see one? One time there was this guy, got shot by someone breaking into his house. Now he's this ghost in his old apartment. He's living there, trying to talk to his wife, but-- But let me guess. There's just this one little boy who can see him. So you know the story too? I saw the movie actually. The Sixth Sense. No, it was nothing like that. I don't care what you say. I think ghosts are real. I see them all the time. Nina, there's one right behind you right now. There actually is something back there. Really? You think I'm gonna turn around now? - Wow, is anybody else seeing this? - It's.... - Too bad. It's gone. - Yeah. It's too late. Mature. Very mature. How long have you and Peter Suderman worked together? We went to PS 41 7 together in Bayside. Lost touch over the years. We reconnected when he was looking for financing for Spirit Trekkers. You believe in ghosts, Arthur? I believe in people who believe in ghosts. - Who'll pay you to look for them? - They're the best kind. People pay to have their palms read, to walk on coals. My cousin shelled out 2 grand for a pomegranate enema. Nothing illegal. There was something illegal about selling diet pills... - ...made of sugar and baking soda. - That was 10 years ago. Look. When people pay for a fortune teller or for a ghost hunter... ...what they're really paying for is happiness. Peter, bless him, he understood that. With all the tragedy in his life-- He lost his wife and son in a car accident. --he understood how powerful that drive for happiness can be. - What was he doing at the sanitarium? - He heard about how haunted it was. - He couldn't resist. - Did he find anything? - Not that I know of. - You know someone named Denny? Yes, Denny Moskin. He's a kid from NYU who's helping Peter at the sanitarium. We had to let him go. He came to the office last week super T'd off. Yelling at us that we owed him money. We're gonna need his contact information... - ...and for all your recent clients. - Sure, but... ...nobody would kill Peter over money. Okay, me? I'm a huckster basically. But Peter was different. It was never about money for him, not for a second. He just wanted to help people. Tenants were hearing noises and threatened to withhold rent. So I called Spirit Trekkers. Suderman shows up with equipment. Kids were taunting our children, said the house we moved into was haunted. Trent and Jane couldn't sleep in their bedrooms. It's the only haunted B and B in the area. We thought it would be an asset to get certification, make it official. - What did Suderman say? - He went through the house. Couldn't find a thing. And he talked to our kids too. No more sleeping problems. Cheaper than the $1 75 an hour I spent on that child psychiatrist. - Suderman wouldn't certify us. - So, what did you do? Went to another guy. He signed off right away. You must have been upset. At first, but Suderman found the problem. Faulty radiator caps. You believe it? Anyway, a few changes later, no more chains clanging at midnight. - Not looking like one of his clients. - You talked to everybody? All except a doctor and his wife in Richmond Hill. Wife's been sick. A couple other clients are out of town. See if they were during the murder. - How about the partner, Arthur Greene? - Alibi checks out. Meeting with his lawyers, then dinner until late. I got Gordon admitted at QHC. He's still going on about Dr. Helen. But he's not being violent, he's got no history of violence. - I don't think this is the guy. - Suderman's cell and financials? Nothing much. I got his credit card charges for the last two months. A couple months? I spend more than this in two days. But I pay my bill in full every month. "Walker-Dunlap." What's that? Bunch of charges to them. It's a forensics lab out in Jersey. Suderman used them from time to time. Did anything else happen here last night? I don't know. - Dr. Helen? - Oh, she's here every night. Gordon had an envelope addressed to Walker-Dunlap in his room. Maybe he got it off of Suderman's body or out of his backpack. Yeah? - We gotta look at that envelope. - I'll get Roe to pick it up. NYU knows where Denny Moskin might be. - I'll grab Nina and head there. - Great. - Let's talk to that doctor and his wife. - Sure. Dr. Barlow, I'm Lieutenant Burns. - This is Detective Wells. - Carrie. We called. I already told the other detective, my wife's not well. That's why we came to you. Thought we'd save you the trouble. Just wanna ask you about Peter Suderman. Sure. Come in. Thanks. That's terrible. Suderman was a good man. He was conducting an investigation for you? We had an issue. We thought we had an issue. But it's resolved now. What kind of an issue exactly? This is an old house. Lot of creaks and groans, wind through the cracks. Things that could be mistaken for something else. Like ghosts. My wife thought she heard something coming from the basement. Some kind of voice. - A voice? - A woman's voice. So we called Mr. Suderman. And he came, found nothing, we thanked him and that was the end of it. Was that the end of it for you, Janine? Of course. How are you feeling? Better, I hope. Sorry? Anything else we can do for you, detectives? I was wondering what kind of medicine you practise. Thoracic surgery. But I developed a slight tremor. Nothing big, I just had to close my practice about a year ago. - Early retirement. - Right. We're planning a long-overdue trip to Paris. That's nice. I was asking because I was hoping you weren't a psychiatrist. Don't want you to laugh when I ask if you mind if I look at the basement. Why the basement? You heard something in there, right? You don't believe me. Oh, no. It's not that at all. I just thought I'd take a look around. The basement's not Janine's favourite place... ...but I'm happy to give you a tour. Interesting place for a nap. That. Ever since Janine's been talking ghosts... ...our nieces and nephews have tried to sleep down here. No one's made it through the night. Yeah, not sure I would either. Detective, I feel like there's something I should tell you. For years, my wife and I have been trying to have children. Our last attempt ended in a miscarriage. We learned it was a little girl. I'm sorry. I think Janine never really fully recovered. This fixation, of course, has to do with the baby. She thinks it was her fault. That's why I called Suderman. - Thought maybe it would help. - And did it? I think so, yes. Do you think it's possible Suderman was having... ...something related to your case tested at a forensics lab? Sorry? No. Maybe we should go back upstairs. I'm a little worried about Janine. Freeze! Cut. Cut. What is happening? Since when are there police? - Dennis Moskin? - Is it about the permits? - Abby, did you file the permits? - Everybody, let's take a break. - I'm not budgeted for a break. - Are you budgeted for bail money? Take 10. This look familiar? - Sure, that's Peter. - He's dead. - For real? - Very real. He was murdered last night in the Queens Park Sanitarium. Audio makes it sound like you were there. And a witness saw the two of you getting into it the other day. - I didn't kill him. - Then why were you at the sanitarium? It was a joke. Oh, I love a joke. How does it go? I went to the sanitarium because I was pissed at Peter. Because he fired you, right? Now, why did he do that? - I don't know. - You are five seconds away... ...from a long, expensive break in production. - Okay, I borrowed some equipment. - So you stole. I was gonna use it in my film, then give it back, but he got angry and fired me. So I took some stuff out to the sanitarium. Neoprene suit, some fibreglass. Scatter the heat signature, create some very kick-ass ghost effects. When he realised it was me... ...he dropped the camera and came after me. So okay... ...this-- This is you. Well, yeah. That's actually pretty good. Wait a minute. Go back a little bit. Wow, there. That's not me. It's moving. What is that? So this is you, but this is not you? So who else was there that night? Just the kooky homeless guy who lives there. You realise how lame this story is sounding? I swear, I just scared him. He was alive when I left. Look, I shot my own film of the whole thing. You can look at it. Now, that is even lamer. I must inform you gentlemen... ...whatever was or is in this envelope may have been contaminated. There's no chain of custody here. Just need to know what Suderman wanted tested. Criminologist Tanya Sitkowksy. I'm opening evidence bag marked 1 7-Alpha-591 ... ...containing one padded manila envelope. Approximately 20.3 centimetres by 25.4 centimetres. Gives new meaning to the word "approximately." - Removing one synthetic bag-- - What's inside the bag? - That's what we care about. - You can't rush science. I believe Archimedes said that. And I believe you say it every time we come down here. - It's a bone. - What kind of bone? A human bone, if I'm not mistaken. Give me a moment. Or two. Yes. A human finger would be more precise. I would say the fifth distal phalanx from the right extremity. Pinky finger. Hard to determine much more without complete skeletal and subdural remains. As you might say, I need the dead guy. Suderman found a pinky. Where's the body? And who's the body? My guess, we find out, we find who killed him. "A brief assessment of the dorsal surface indicates non-granularity... ...lack of macroporosity, lack of striations," yada, yada, jeez, Tanya-- "Almost certain identification of the subject as female... ...aged approximately 15 years." Great. Maybe those rumours about a grave under the sanitarium are true. This girl never would've been admitted to Queens Park. Run the DNA through the index system, see if it ties to any open homicides. Suderman could've picked up that bone anywhere. Our film boy, Denny, seems like he's in the clear. I watched that stuff he shot. Suderman was scared, but they end up laughing. Wait a second. This-- This bone has trace amounts of zinc phosphide. Zinc phosphide. Of course. - Really, Roe? - All right, go ahead. Zinc phosphide is one of the key ingredients found in rat poison. The Barlows had rat traps all over their basement. You think Suderman found the bone in their basement? Janine heard a woman's voice from the basement. Maybe he found the bone there. We're not getting a warrant based on rat traps and a ghost. I'll talk to Arthur Greene and see if he knew anything. I'm gonna head to the Barlows, see what I can find out. We should actually confirm Suderman found the bone in their house. You're absolutely right. - You should confirm that. - Carrie. I'm not gonna try to get into the house without a warrant. I'm not. You heard that. Dr. Barlow. - Carrie Wells. - I remember. Yeah, is Janine around? I wanted to ask a few more questions regarding the Suderman investigation. Detective, my wife, she heard voices. - A voice, actually. - The man came to the house. He didn't find anything. I'm sorry he died. I don't see how I can help. We have a piece of evidence from your basement... ...that could be connected to Peter's murder. - What piece of evidence? - I'd like to talk to your wife. She's inside, with a headache. Asleep. She gets terrible headaches. Migraines. A piece of potentially crucial evidence was found inside your basement. Me? I'd want to get to the bottom of that as soon as possible. I'm not gonna dignify that with a response. I thought we had an understanding. I'm gonna go into my house now. I suggest you get off my property. - Hey. - Where the hell are you? Outside the Barlow house. - Good. - How we doing on that warrant? - DA says were close. - Close? You know, Al... ...I think I'm hearing an argument going on inside. No, you're not. Yeah, it's getting pretty heated in there. Carrie, don't even think about it. - See, now I hear glass breaking. - No, you don't. Sounds like she might be in trouble. We got exigent circumstances here. - Carrie, you can't go in there. - AI? Al? I think I lost you. No, you didn't lose me, listen to me. Damn reception. Please wake up. Please wake up. - Oh, thank God you're okay. - Where am I? What happened? Sam. He was afraid you were gonna tell someone. - That I was gonna tell someone. - Tell them what? About her. Are you gonna untie me? - Wait a sec. Where's my gun? - He took it. After he knocked you out. He was furious. Then he made me come down here. - Oh, God. - He knows I can hear her crying. That's why he locks me down here. To punish me. He's done this before? For days, sometimes. You gotta help me up. You shouldn't have come back here. We're gonna get out of here. All right. Do you hear her? No. It's so dark where she is. She's afraid of the dark. - She's crying. - Janine, listen to me. Look at me. No one's gonna hurt you, okay? - We're getting out of here. - We're gonna die. He's going to kill us both. The ME got a DNA match on that bone. It's a runaway from upstate, Lily Mueller. She was 1 4 when she left. Her mother's on her way. - A shame. - Yeah. Anybody heard from Carrie? I tried her cell, went to voicemail. Wanted to tell her Janine Barlow's... ...medical records don't say anything about a miscarriage. Roe, get over to the Barlow house, make sure Carrie's not in it. I can't get it open. I'm sorry, Carrie. I deserve to be here, not you. That's ridiculous. I knew what he did. In my heart... ...I always knew. And I never said a word. The girl. Who is she? Her name was Lily. I met her in the park. She was living there, she ran away from home. I know I should've called the police... ...but we started talking... ...and she told me about her life and I felt sorry for her. So I asked her to come here and help around the house. Have a roof over her head. She was so sweet. She made this old dead house feel alive. I always wanted a little girl of my own. But Sam wanted her too. And when I confronted him, he was furious. He denied it... ...but I knew. The next day she was gone. He told me he fired her. But he didn't. I found a pair of sneakers in the garbage behind the house. There was blood on them. I think it was his way of telling me... ...without telling me. I know it sounds crazy... ...but ever since then, I've been hearing her cries. - But you don't hear them. No one does. - Janine, Janine. I'm gonna get us out of here. We're gonna get out of here. There's always a way. I wish I had some light. Here. I keep this hidden because sometimes he cuts out the light. This is great. Okay, this'll help. Let's see. - Oh, boy. - See? He's trying to kill us. Janine, Janine. Look at me. Stay focused on me. I want you to think, really hard. Is there any way out of this basement? - There's gotta be some way out. - Yes. - Okay, where? - Yes, there is. There. There. It's a crawl space that runs under the entire house. - But I've been afraid to use it. - It's all right. Take this. Hold on. All right. Okay. Okay. Come on. - All right. All right. - No. That's not gonna work. No, no. no. - Listen to me. I'll find another way. - There is no other way. Give me a second. These old houses were built for coal, right? Question is how do you get the coal to the basement? You use a coal chute. Hold this. Lily! Come on. This way. Go. We gotta go. - Isn't that your husband's car? - I guess. Why is his car still here? That doesn't.... He's still inside. It's not possible. I want you to stay here and call 911. - No, no. Where are you going? - I'm going to get him. Call 911. - Stay. - Carrie. Hey. Come on. Wake up. - Carrie? - Come on. I'm over here. Come on. Sam Barlow's still in intensive care. When he's up to it, they're gonna transfer him to the prison. So husband kills a girl. Suderman found part of the body. Guy sets fire to take out his wife, destroy the evidence. What's he doing in the house? Had to get liquored to do it. Never got out. Findings on the doctor's bag in Sam Barlow's trunk. Got a bloody scalpel. Their checking for prints. Gonna match the blood to Suderman's. Mud on his tyres looks like a match to the mud outside the sanitarium. Why's the guy hire a ghost hunter... ...to look around right where he's buried the girl? Classic arrogance of the non-believer. See, Barlow's a doctor, man of science. He thinks Suderman's a quack. Gonna let him come in, sniff around a little... ...calm the wife down, send him on his way. Then the bone shows up and it's like, "Katy, bar the door." But you gotta admit there's no ghost in this story. - Yeah? - Yeah. What's the wife hearing down in the basement? - Did you just say, "Katy, bar the door"? - Yeah, it's an expression. Like, "Get out of my face." Like, "Talk to the fist because the hand is pissed." - What the hell are you doing here? - I'm okay. Turns out you don't use the back of your head for very much. Mike tells me you went back in to save Barlow's life. I went back in to get my badge and gun. Barlow happened to be there. Least he won't be around Janine anymore. We got her in touch with a friend from school. - Put them both up in a hotel for now. - Good. Look, I know you're gonna do what you're gonna do... ...but going back into a burning house? Sometimes it feels like you wanna get hurt. He was in the house just lying there. What was I supposed to do? You could've died. But I didn't. - I didn't know you cared so much. - Hate to lose a good detective. - Really? - Yup. Hey. I did more work on the thermal footage. That other shape in the background. I called my friend at NASA who gave me this algorithm-- Tanya. Sorry. I was able to enhance it. Turns out, it's a flashlight. It's thermal. Wouldn't it show up bright? Yeah, if it was on. This one was off. What you're seeing is the vestigial heat pattern. - What are those spots? - Multiple bulbs. LED, halogen. - It's one of those new ones. - Can you tell what kind? Ahead of you. Based on bulb placement and light source... ...there are a few that could produce this pattern. But based on size and design of the head chassis, there's really only one. The Powerstream 4800. I keep this hidden because sometimes he cuts out the light. She walks up and down the hall with her black stick. She blinds you with it. That's what she does. Janine had one of these flashlights in her basement. Can I borrow this? - Why the basement? - You don't believe me. Please wake up. Thank God you're okay. - I'm going inside. - Don't. Carrie, don't. Please don't. Hey, its Carrie. When we processed Dr. Barlow, did you check his blood-alcohol level? Zero. Just like I thought. Thank you. Listen to this. Janine Barlow was a surgical nurse. Dismissed from her last position because of a violent incident. It wasn't him. She knocked me out. She's the one who set the fire. She was trying to kill him. And herself. She locked herself in the basement. Without you, she would've died. There's a crawl space that runs under the entire house. No, no, no. She thought she had a way out, but the fire spread too quickly. She was surprised. Call Nina. Tell her to get to the hotel where she put Janine. She won't be there. She tried to kill him once, she's gonna finish the job. We'll call security on the way. Excuse me, where is Sam Barlow? Louis took him downstairs for inhalation therapy. - Are there other elevators? - Around the corner. Down the hall. - I got this one. - All right. - "Louis." - Yeah. Where is Sam Barlow? The other nurse told me to come back and she'd take him. Nurse. This way? - Yeah. - Okay. Janine! Janine. Janine. Janine, listen to me. Put the knife down. He was gonna tell you everything. - No, he was trying to protect you. - No. Janine, hey. Okay, put the knife down. I loved him. I loved him and he just wanted her. He lied for you for years. Think about that. That's gotta mean something, right? - I just wanna go home. - I know. Put the knife down and we can all go home together. All right? Just put the knife down. That's all you have to do and we can go. - I can't. - Yes, you can. She's waiting for me. No. Janine, no. She's waiting for him. No. I got her. - Are you okay? - Yeah. I just wanna get out of here. - How about him? - He's okay. - Get a little help over here? - I'm all right. - It's just.... - You're gonna need stitches. - Did I mention I hate needles? - Quit being a baby, will you? - I'm not getting in that thing. - I got this. You could be a little more rude to him. Thought I'd find you up here. So Barlow's awake and talking. He confesses to hiding the body of Lily Mueller, but not to killing her. That was Janine. Jealousy. According to Barlow, there was no reason. She made it all up. What about Suderman? When Barlow realised she killed him... ...he didn't have the heart to cover for her again. He told her as much, that he was gonna come clean to us-- So he had to die. Do you know she told me she loved him? Strange way of showing it, burning him alive. I'm more of a red roses kind of girl. The weird thing with Janine... ...she didn't know the body was down there... ...but she was hearing things. Let me ask you. After all these years... ...since your sister died... ...do you ever feel...? I don't know. You ever get a feeling? Are you asking me if I believe in ghosts? Yeah, I guess I am. I wanna believe... ...that there's more after we die, you know? I wanna believe that Rachel... ...is still here in some way. And sometimes I can feel her so close, like she's all around me. I can feel her like I could just reach out... ...and touch her almost. And I know she's there. I do. I just-- I wish.... What? I wish she'd say hello.
