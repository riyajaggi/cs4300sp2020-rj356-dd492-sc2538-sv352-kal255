Show us your hands! This way out, boss. Hey! (siren wails in distance) (phone rings) Good morning. Morning. Where are you? At my desk. Where are you really? I'm actually at my desk. Hey, look, pigs are flying. Very funny. I got a new alarm clock, you know. It brews coffee and picks out my outfit. Where are you? Headed to the Morganson Rec Center. We got a fresh one at the Youth League basketball tournament. (groans) All right, I'll, uh, I'll see you there in 15. Bye. Hundreds of people around, nobody will admit to seeing it go down. ROE: Welcome to the neighborhood. The Rec Center was sponsoring a tournament for all the borough's youth league teams. First game had just started when the shooting happened. Which was when? Uh, 20, 25 minutes ago. ROE: We got the perimeter locked down? Security on the scene did the best they could. I'm sure they lost some people after the shooting. Let me guess. That camera's not working. Yeah, apparently, the neighborhood kids use it for target practice. Marisa Perez. She's a freshman at CUNY. Without video, we're gonna need I.D.'s on all these spectators, full interview with everyone. And I think I'm on the last page of my notebook. (gunshot) (multiple gunshots) (people screaming) (gunshots continue) Steve? Steve... Don't move. All right, you're gonna be all right. - I can't believe they shot me! - It's just a graze. It's just a graze. Hey, I want you to look at me. Look at me. Look at me. What's your name? Beverly. Beverly...? Beverly Jackson. Okay, Beverly, you're gonna be fine, all right? It's just a graze. These guys are gonna help you right here. - Oh, my God. - You're gonna be fine, Beverly. - Okay. - I gotta go help other people. Beverly, you're gonna be fine. Okay. Caught these guys running away. You got anything on 'em? You. Yeah, you had a gun. But if he pulled the trigger, I didn't see it. Okay. Get a residue test on his hands, see if he fired the gun. I want you to get all these weapons here and hand-deliver 'em to the lab ASAP. Go. Do we know who this is? No, but he's wearing QB-6 gang colors. Yeah, we got guns dumped all over the place. Seven so far. Looks like some were fired, some weren't. Smart. Don't want to get caught carrying here. Ballistics will be working overtime tonight. This is officially a nightmare. Wait a second. There-there was a guy running towards Marisa's body right before the shots were fired. White, mid-40s, about six-one, six-two wearing a blue-collared shirt. Red shoes, by any chance? Yeah. How'd you know? You see him? One of the other vics, he had red shoes. WOMAN: Let me go! Let me go! She's my daughter! Hey, hey, let her go! I got this! Let her go! Let her go! Let her go! Mrs. Perez, Mrs. Perez, I can't let you touch her right now, okay? We can't let you. No! No! (sobbing) She's my baby! I'm sorry. OFFICER: One shooting victim DOA. Another seriously injured. Several others being triaged. What's the vic's name? Jim Clayburn. His boy told me he's some kind of community activist. Works with kids. That the son? Got a name? Jim, Jr. Goes by "JJ." He give you anything else? Nah, he wasn't up to talking. JJ? Yeah. I'm Lieutenant Burns. This is Detective Saunders. How are you? I can't believe... I mean, how did this even happen? (sobs) That's what we need to figure out. Did you see who shot your dad? No. One of our people saw him running into the crowd just as the shooting started. Any idea why? What? Your dad. He was running just before he got shot. I was here with friends. I didn't even know that my dad was gonna be here today. He usually works on Saturdays. What kind of work does your father do? He's, uh, he works with gang members. He tries to get them straight, I guess. We'll talk more later. Go be with your father. Clayburn works with gang kids. We've got at least one gang shooting. Maybe we can cross "accidental victim" off our list. My neighbor called to tell me Marisa had been shot. So, you live nearby? Just three blocks. I yelled at her this morning... for using the last of my shampoo. Hilda, is there anyone you can think of, anyone at all that might want to hurt Marisa? She's a good girl. She's going to college. She's a good girl. Was Marisa in trouble? Hilda, listen to me, okay? All I care about is finding whoever did this. I need you to help me. When she was 13... that gang, DKK... they got her to join. She didn't know what she was getting into. And she was trying to leave them. Trying? She was going to school, to college. And then a couple of weeks ago, she went back to them. I don't know why. And now she's dead. So, according to her mother, Marisa Perez knew Jim Clayburn. He helped her get into college. When she got into CUNY, she told her mom she was quitting the gang for good. Leaving a gang's hard if those were her friends and if it was all she knew. But if she was one of his victories, Clayburn might not have give up so easy. Could be he was going after whoever shot her. Clayburn's out of surgery. - They think he's going to make it. - Good. What do we have on the two guys we grabbed at the scene? Well, one guy's gun hasn't been fired, and the other one had a .45, and none of the rounds removed from the vics are a match. What about the other body... the guy from QB-6? Fingerprints peg him as Oskar Mendoza. Not the kind of boy you want to bring home to mother. Wow. Guy was dedicated to his chosen career. Which is what, general dickishness? Maybe. But if QB-6 killed Marisa and DKK killed Mendoza in retaliation, QB-6 is not going to let it go. This whole thing could spin out of control. So what are you thinking? Time to call in the cavalry. This is Detective Ben Cortez with the gang squad. He's going to give us a better idea of what we're up against. All right, these are arrest photos of known members and associates of DKK, Dominican Killa Kings. That's the gang that Marisa ran with. They recruit mostly out of high schools. They're carving out their territory in Northern Queens and now the Bronx. What about that other gang, uh, QB-6? Queens-Bronx Six. Let me put it this way. DKK traffics narcotics and occasionally shoots somebody. QB-6 traffics narcotics, guns, people. They do hits for hire, arson, and that's on a good day. Well, did you have any warning that these two gangs were about to start shooting at each other? No. We made progress recently. We just started to get some better intel. Hey. Sorry we're late. We were finishing up on-scene interviews. This is Ben Cortez. Yeah. You were at the rec center. Yeah, I was just getting to that. We got tipped that some DKK members were going down to watch the tournament. In QB-6 territory? You didn't think to mention that? Look, I was there. I didn't see who shot the girl. The girl? Marisa... her name is Mari... But you know that, don't you? That's why you were upset when you saw her on the ground. You knew her. As a matter of fact, I did. She was my CI. She was your better intel? Yeah. You used a 17-year-old girl as a confidential informant? She was helping us build a case against DKK. She was informing on her own gang? For about a month. Yes. Well, no wonder you looked so shocked when you saw her on the ground. You got her killed. I am all for taking down a gang, but using a 17-year-old girl as an informant... Maybe her gang never found out. I mean, we don't know - that's what got her killed. - Yes, we do. She was turning her life around, Al, and Cortez came in and screwed it up. Then the best thing we can do for her is find out who killed her. Okay, but I'm not working with him. So take Roe, get out to that Rec Center and see what you can put together. We got ten shots to account for. Okay, yellow markers are for shell casings. Red are guns. Cones are victims. (gunshot, people screaming) (three gunshots) (two gunshots) (four gunshots) (one gunshot) Okay, let's start with the first shot. It came from over... here. (gunshot) Sound was muffled. Had to be point-blank range. So that would make our first victim after Marisa, Jim Clayburn. Yeah, found him right here. So maybe we're right. He knew who was after Marisa and confronted him. Okay. What's next? (three loud gunshots) (two more gunshots) Five shots from over here, three from a bigger caliber gun. Six shots so far. That's one of our guys we picked up. .45 automatic. But none of the victims were shot with a .45, so he's just shooting. So, from this angle, one of the bullets could have hit our bystander, Beverly Jackson. Bullet like that'd do some damage. No, it was just a flesh wound. I mean, I'm sure it stung a little, but she was kind of dramatic. Wow. Your empathy's overwhelming. Then the only thing we've got is the gang kid, Mendoza, standing. Four shots left. (four gunshots) CARRIE: Four shots. (four gunshots) And Mendoza's still alive. (two gunshots) Crime scene only picked up ten shell casings. Yeah, so? (one gunshot) So there was an 11th shot. It killed Mendoza. I heard it. Yeah, where from? Right back... here. There was a Parks Enforcement guard near there. He might have had a front-row seat. CARRIE: Yeah, he was there. He give a statement? Herb Waters, age 51, 16-year veteran of the Parks and Recreation Department. His statement, and I quote: "I didn't see any of the shooters." Mm-hmm. Yeah, well, we should talk to him again. Even if he didn't see a shooter, maybe he saw someone picking up the casing or at least looking for something on the ground. Maybe. Hey, quick... what'd I have for lunch yesterday? I don't know, Roe. What'd you have for lunch yesterday? I don't know. I was hoping you'd remember, so I could order something else. I just... Like I said, I heard shots, then I saw that guy go down. Well, which one? There were... there were two. Um, one of these? Him. Older guy. - Okay. Jim Clayburn. - He okay? It's too soon to tell. So you saw Mr. Clayburn get shot. Did you get a look at who did it? No. Everything happened so fast. I went to go help him. You know, let's go over this again. Let's see. All right, so where were you standing? Here. Okay, so you ran from here to here. All right. Did you see this kid get shot? No. I didn't actually get to Mr. Clayburn. There were more shots. It was chaos, kids running everywhere. I was just trying to keep them safe. Mm-hmm. Uh, what about afterwards? You see anyone scrounging around, looking for something on the ground? What do you mean? Looking for what? A shell casing. We got an extra shot, no casing to go with it. Wow. How do you know that? So did you see anyone or not? Look, I-I shouldn't have even been there. I don't know the area. I work out at Spring Creek Park. I'm just trying to pick up some extra overtime before I retire next month. I get it. I get it. You're dealing with a gang guy. Seems scary to come clean. Hey. But if you got something to say, I need you to say it. It looked like he was reaching for a gun. Who? You shot Mendoza. He was reaching to his waistband. And all those punks were pulling out their weapons. I was just trying to protect the other kids. What was he reaching for? A cell phone. A lousy cell phone. I got to take you in. I wasn't even supposed to be there. ROE: Guy was just scared. I mean, he didn't have the training to be in that situation. Hopefully, the DA will cut him some slack. Clayburn awake yet? Last I checked, he was just out of surgery. Carrie! Talk to you a second? I don't care. Just get me access. There's got to be a doctor with some parking tickets he wants fixed. - Okay. - Hey. Hi. Uh, I'll go check on Clayburn. Close the door. Yep. No problem. What's up? I just got a call from a lieutenant in the Three-Eight. Why were your fingerprints lifted after a raid on an illegal poker game in some Chinese restaurant? - They have good dim sum. - You're a cop. Yes, whose annual salary doesn't even begin to cover my mother's care. That's your excuse? You needed the money for Alice? Oh, come on, Al. - It was a harmless card game. - It's illegal. Yes, and I'm sure they arrested a lot of very bad people. And you're lucky one of them wasn't you. You'd lose your badge and you'd go to jail. How would your mom be then? What do you want me to say? - I don't know what... - Ballistics came back. None of the weapons we recovered at the scene are a match to the victims. But get this... the gun that shot Marisa is the same gun - that shot Jim Clayburn. - We just don't have it. - NINA: We just don't have it. - AL: But if they're connected, - we're looking for one guy. - CARRIE: Oh, look at that. Beverly Jackson, the woman with the arm wound, she's finally ready to talk, so I'm going to go - talk to her. - We're not done here. I am. - I should go. Um... - Yes. Just go with Mike, see what you can dig up about Clayburn. MAN: The kids are taking it hard. That's what they call them... "Jim's Kids." Jim poured everything he had into this mission. When his wife died back in '98, he decided to bring all these lost kids into his family. To turn his grief into something powerful. But... and I'm sorry, Father... but they're not all going to turn out to be success stories. There's got to be somebody who had a grudge against him. Look, this neighborhood has seen gang reformers come and go for decades, but Jim, he was... he was in a class by himself. People respect him, and that's half the battle. So no threats, calls, letters? No, these kids love him. They wouldn't have hurt him. Or let anybody else hurt him. Had you seen Marisa around lately? No. She was back with the gang. And Jim knew that? Yeah. He was upset. He asked me a bunch if there was something he could do to get her to come back. So maybe he tried too hard to convince her, one of the DKKs started to question her loyalty. What else you got, Estella? (sighs) Some of the girls from around here, they were saying that Marisa was in trouble with the DKK. For what? I didn't ask. No one told me. But I bet you got an idea. In this neighborhood, having ideas will get you shot. Detective. Detective Wells! I'm gonna sit in on the interview, if that's all right. What did you have on her, Cortez? She was getting out. She was on her way to college, she had a full scholarship. You dragged her back in. What did you have on her that was so terrible? She was in a car with a kilo of coke in the trunk. Was she driving? No. Then no way that sticks. But she wouldn't know that, would she? (sighs) What'd you do, threaten to call the admissions office if she didn't do what you wanted, - then bye-bye scholarship. - Listen. I did pick her up, but I didn't threaten her. When she found out I was in a gang unit, she offered to go back in to help us. Said she didn't want any more kids getting trapped like she did. You could've said no. And believe me, next time I will. There isn't a next time. She's dead. ROE: Thanks for coming in, Ms. Jackson. I would've come in sooner, but I didn't think I could be much help. Well, you never know. Yeah. Even if you didn't see who shot you, maybe you saw someone running away? No, I didn't see anything. I was just walking back from the cheese shop on 31st Avenue, and heard some loud sounds, and... I didn't even realize I was the one shot till I saw my arm bleeding. One of the ones... who was shot. A girl died. I don't appreciate your attitude. I know about the girl. You're a lawyer, right? Mulligan & Waters? Yes. We're at, uh, 40th... 40th and Park, on the 59th floor, I know. So you didn't see anything. Nothing at all. What about when you were walking to the cheese shop? Do you remember which route you took? Before you answer, you should know that we are going to use all of our resources to verify your answer. You should be easy to remember, you were wearing that burnt orange jacket, turquoise scarf, and those earrings that were, frankly, way too big for the outfit. So what if I was? So what? So... just because you didn't see anyone, doesn't mean someone didn't see you. Maybe someone in a gang. CARRIE: It also means that if you're lying to us, we're going to charge you with hindering the prosecution. Want to take a peek at these pictures again, ma'am? I saw this girl. She was arguing with a man, I don't know what about, but he was holding her arm, and she was trying to get away. Describe him. Hispanic. Early 20s, brown sweatshirt. Cap with a lot of metal and stuff on it. Wait a second. Yeah. How'd you know? (sighs) Who's this? Tito Alvarez. - He's DKK... - DKK. I didn't see him at the rec center. I did. You're thinking he's the doer? Look, I was, uh... I got a witness who saw him manhandling Marisa right before she was shot. Hey. We've got some stuff on Tito Alvarez. The DKK practically runs in his family. He's got a brother that went away for a drive-by in '08, he's got uncles and cousins been wearing the colors going back a decade or so. Any specific history with Marisa? - Well, none that I could find. - How about him and Clayburn? Well, Clayburn's program reached out to all the gangs, so Alvarez would've known about him, but that's, - that's all I got. - All right. Good. You... you want I should close the door? Why would I want you to... Oh. Sorry about that. It's none of my business, but is there something going on with you and our star reporter? No. Same as usual. Yeah. Let me ask you: that buddy of yours in Vice, in the Three-Eight? You guys still close? Yeah. Jim Parsons. He's a good guy. And he's... discreet, right? Sure. I mean... depends what we're talking about. Maybe I'll give him a call. All right. Like I said, it's none of my business, but... back in the day, when you two were... Was she...? Was she always so... original? Yeah. I think I'll give Jim a call. If nobody's dead, he can probably help. (phone rings) Yeah. Yep? I'm heading over. That was the hospital. Clayburn's awake. AL: Clayburn's conscious now, but he's still touch and go. This is our chance to get his statement, and make Tito as the shooter. I should be out looking for Tito. Detective Cortez has the whole gang squad out after him. Oh, he's taking time out from recruiting teenage informants. How nice of him. JJ, how you doing? Fantastic. Mr. Clayburn, are you able to answer some questions for us? He can't talk yet. The tube. He's been using this. They're cops, Dad. He wants to know if "his kids" are okay. Yeah. They're having a vigil at the church for you. "Marisa"? No, I'm sorry. "She was so brave. A hero." CARRIE: I know. That's why we're here. We want to catch whoever did this. We think the person who shot Marisa is the same person that shot you. Do you recognize anyone in these photos? Tito Alvarez? Is this the man who shot you? Yes. (phone chimes) Okay. I think that's all we need. Thank you. Ben knows where Tito is. Girlfriend's house. Great. Thanks. ♪ ♪ (knocking on door) Can I help you, Officers? We're looking for Tito Alvarez. He here? Oh, I don't know any Tito. I think you must be mistaken. Mrs. Garcia, please. Is your daughter at home? My daughter? Police! (laughs) Where you going, Tito? Right here... Oh, I love what you've done with the place. Why Marisa? Why Marisa what? She was a good girl, Tito. Hey, man, I wasn't even at the game that day. Sure you were. I saw you there. Well, baby, you must be mistaken, 'cause I just told you I wasn't there. Brown sweatshirt, blinged-out baseball cap, little mustard right here from the hot dog you were eating. Okay. Okay, I was there. But I didn't shoot nobody. So what were you and Marisa arguing about? - What? - Don't "what" me. You were slapping her around right before she got shot. Hey, Marisa was hauling off on me, man. Why? 'Cause I didn't want to get with her crazy ass anymore. You and Marisa were involved? No, baby. Me and Marisa hooked up. She got clingy. I don't want to be locked down. Supply can't meet demand, you know? AL: Sure. And Clayburn. What's your beef with him? - Who? - Don't play dumb! You mean Mr. "Jim's Kids"? Wait, hold up. You guys think I shot him. Yeah. We think you shot him. Right after you shot Marisa. You used the same gun, baby. What? No, no, no. I didn't have no beef with that guy. - I didn't shoot him. - Then why'd you run from the scene? I didn't run! I stayed there. I left a statement with the cops. - Funny, I don't remember seeing that. - I used a fake name. I don't want you all calling me, trying to get me to testify. - You're full of it, Tito. - The cop was a white dude. Big fat-ass dude, all right? He frisked me and everything. You gotta believe me. All right, look, dont give me any leak. Show me some ID. You got ID? What's your name? Cop made you take your sweatshirt off, didn't he? Right? Yeah, before he frisked me. So what? I need to talk to you. Hey, yo... this ain't right, man. I want to talk to my lawyer, and I still want my phone call! Why don't you shut up, Tito? Tito's telling the truth. He wasn't armed, - and he didn't run. - You sure about this? We didn't find the murder weapon at the scene. I saw that officer frisk him. At that point, he did not have a gun, which means he couldn't have shot Clayburn. So Clayburn was wrong. Either that, or he's lying. Okay, assuming you're remembering right, and Tito didn't shoot Clayburn... She's remembering right. It still doesn't mean he didn't shoot Marisa. He could've handed the gun off to somebody afterwards. Hey. When we brought Tito in, he took his phone call. Another perp overheard him ordering a hit on the amigo who got him locked up. What amigo? Tito didn't mention a name. If Tito handed his gun off to someone else, that someone can tie him to Marisa's murder. We better figure out who it is and find them before Tito's people do. We know Tito didn't shoot you. Why do you keep insisting that he did? Look, I'm not making this up. Tito's a killer. Look at me and tell me who really shot you. I don't know. Who are you protecting? One of the kids in your program? ♪ ♪ "I forgive you." JJ shot you, didn't he? Your son? Why? Did he shoot Marisa, as well? What? No. Look, you don't understand. Then make me understand. It was an accident. It's my own fault. I spent so much time with my kids... my other kids... that I neglected my own son. I think that JJ wanted me to feel the pain that he felt. JJ wasn't there with you, he was there with the gang, wasn't he? He's not in the gang, but they let him hang around. He does it to get back at me. You're saying that shooting you was some kind of teenage cry for attention? He didn't mean to shoot me. I saw him there with his friends, I went to grab him, and when I did, I felt he had something under his jacket. I was afraid it was... what it was. A gun. He's so much smarter than that. I tried to take it away, and it went off. So JJ fought you? I didn't know that Tito had given JJ the gun to get rid of it... you know, give it to the white kid; he's a lot less likely to get frisked by the cops. But JJ didn't know that Tito had killed Marisa. He thought he was just helping out a friend. But you knew. You knew that Tito killed Marisa. That's why you said he was the one who shot you, right? Marisa called me in a panic. She said that her gang buddies had found out she was working with the police, and Tito was going to kill her. I raced down to the park to try and pick her up. But she was already dead. I told you... I'm not lying about Tito. He's a murderer. Yes, he is. And he knows JJ can prove it. That's why he sent the gang out looking for him. What? Where is JJ right now? I-I was sending him out of town. He went home to pack his stuff. We got to go. Those guys were at the Rec Center. Al, there's JJ! Stop the car. (sirens approaching) (handcuffs clicking) This is the gun Tito gave you? Yes. And you'll testify to that in court? Yes, of course. Then we're done here. Hey, Burns, let me ask you a question. Wells... what's her deal? AL: Her deal?! You know, is she seeing anyone? Yeah. She's in a relationship. (knocks) Hey. Look, I just wanted to set the record straight on Marisa. I told you that if had to do it over again, I would've said no. But the fact is, I'm not so sure. You're not so sure. This is a hellish job, trying to stop children from killing children. And I say, God bless Jim Clayburn for everything he does, but unless those kids see things another way, it's never gonna stop. And you and I can't show that to them. Only the Marisas can do that. Not anymore she can't. Don't be so sure. Anyway, I just wanted to be honest with you. Cortez. I appreciate that. How is JJ? Well, he's not completely off the hook. He did discharge a firearm in public. But with his testimony against Tito, D.A. should go easy on him. So, uh, about this harmless little card game. Do we have to talk about that? I get the money part... your mom... not saying it's right, but I get it. And, since nobody was injured, I'll square things with the Three-Eight, tell them you were undercover on a case. Thank you. But you and I both know, this stuff you do, it's not really for the money. Maybe not. See, I think you get a little bored sometimes. You like to push it a little. Maybe more than a little. Except, there's this whole badge thing, you know, what we do here. Right. I know. I'm gonna work on that. Just say you'll be careful. (sighs): Hmm. That a promise? That's a "hmm." Oh. So you're on a waving basis now? (laughs) Yeah, it would appear that way. He's not your type. Really? Absolutely. How can you be so sure? Because I don't like him.
