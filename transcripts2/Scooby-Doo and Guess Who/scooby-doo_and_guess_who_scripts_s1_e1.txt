It's the Swamp Monster! You big scaredy caddy. That's just a bird. Fine! I'll finish by myself. Lord Subs presents Scooby-Doo and Guess Who?

Who'd send Shaggy a private helicopter? - An old friend. - A rich old friend. Then let's see who this Beeman of Alcatraz really is.

 - Quickly! - Bob the Beekeeper! Yup, didn't see that coming. All yours, boys. Take him away. And I would have got away with it... - What did he say? - You know, the usual! Shaggy, where are we going again? Lost Springs Golf Course, Florida. Why does that sound familiar? Right. Here it is. Several golfers have gone missing in freak accidents there this week. Not surprising. Golf is like the most dangerous sport there is, man. The horror! Dude, the horror! Well, the rumor is, some horrible Swamp Monster is taking them. Swamp Monster! Like, gulp. Heads up! Basketball legend Chris Paul? Throw me some heat, Shaggy man. What's up, C.P.? I'm so glad you're gonna caddy for me 'cause I gotta bring my A-game in this tournament. No way! That was before I heard about some gooky Swamp Monster. No, no, no. Ain't no backing out now. I saved your life once. Remember? I need you, Shaggy! Quite right. Copy that. Well, you called the right mystery solvers, Mr. Paul. We'll find the truth behind your Swamp Monster. It's what we do. So, this is the school. It means a lot to me. So, Mr. Paul, this art school is funded - by the golf tournament? - Yeah, and if it doesn't happen, the school will be forced to close. And that can't happen. Better get used to it not being here, Mr. Paul. With half the golfers missing or having quit because of that horrible Swamp Monster, we might as well pack up and go home now! Boy, she's a negative Nelly. You know it, Fred. But listen here. - She is not why I'm doing this. - We are! It's kind of my thing to promote healthy activities for kids. - Like teaching them basketball? - No. - By golfing? - No. Bowling! Let me get this right. Basketball legend and assist king, Chris Paul... - Is playing in a golf tournament... - To save an art school... So he can teach them bowling? Now, you're getting it. I invented these outdoor bowling lanes so everyone can enjoy bowling and be outside at the same time. Is it bowling time, Mr. Paul? Yeah, she knows. - Thanks, C.P. - It's always bowling time. Look at me, C.P., I'm bowling. Chris! - Help! - Hang on! Yikes! No! - Like, what was that? - It's a sinkhole. Sometimes during droughts or bad weather, sinkholes will collapse. This school is doomed! Doomed, I say. Welcome, everyone, to the last 18 holes of the Lost Waters Fundraiser Tournament. Let's meet the top three remaing golfers who haven't been taken by the Swamp Monster. Burt Friendly, professional nice guy and local land developer. Land developer? Okay, it's probably that guy. Our local curmudgeon and self-proclaimed child hater and art despiser, Arthur C. Habernackle. Angry child hater and art despiser? It's probably that guy. And the owner of the golf course, Hadlee P. Jones, who's been trying to buy the land from under the art school for years. So, it's probably, definitely him. Let's see if we can find any clues about these crazy Swamp Monster sightings. Good luck in the tournament, Mr. Paul. Thanks, Fred, but don't need luck. Got my swag on. And I got Shaggy. Here you go, C.P. No, this one. No, this is good. No. Here, try this one. Wait, this one's good. Kidding. This is it. Right. Check. Wait! Man! Like, shake it off, C.P., it's still early. You can still win this thing, dude! Man, I couldn't hit a ball into the ocean. - Any advice, main man? - Golf is like a sandwich. It's important to have the right balance. You know how the bread sits exactly on top of the corn beef and sauerkraut, but you need just the right amount of mustard on top and the bottom. You know what I'm saying? Right amount of mustard, yeah... Shoot, Shaggy, that was some sick advice. Advice? Like, what advice? Like, I'm just hungry, dude. I was making a sand-wish. It's like when you're wishing you had a sandwich, but you don't. I called that a "sand-wish." Pretty sand-wish. It's been a solid day of golf here at Lost Waters because there is not a Swamp Monster in sight. I'm still hopeful this tournament is actually going to finish and the school will get the charity money. Swamp Monster! Where'd they go? Squirrels, hello? We are continuing now. I see guys. They have sticks. They're hitting the ground. No, they're hitting a little white ball. Wait a minute! The Swamp Monster is out of the water. Wait now. He's on the green in two steps. He's chasing that golfer. Mr. Paul is in the weeds. And Shaggy is hiding. Look out, Shaggy. Look out! The Swamp Monster has turned. This looks bad... For me. Help! Get him off me. Help! Swamp Monster! Get him off me! Where did he go? Gang, looks like we've got a real mystery on our hands. Not one clue. It doesn't make sense how the Swamp Monster comes and goes without leaving a trace. It doesn't make sense how they leave these hotdogs uneaten at the end of the day. It's like a crime or something. - Let's smash 'em. - Pass me the dog, dog. - Yeah! - You got it. Scooby, behind the back, ankle breaker, double crossover, wide step, in and out, wrap around, spin move, between the legs, wide open, he takes the shot. It's good. Heads up! It's a scuba divers regulator, for breathing underwater. I think I just got an idea. Time to do a little cave diving. This water trap is what they call a blue hole. And it's connected to the underground aquifer system. These caves go on for miles. Look. What's that? Scuba tanks? And they're all full. Why does a monster need scuba tanks? Probably because he isn't a real monster, Scooby-Doo? You said it, Mr. Paul. There are no such things as monsters. Like, run. Run for your lives! I mean, like, swim. Swim. Swim for your lives! Guys! Up there! We're at the Art School. And so is that monster. There you are. Like, hurry up, dude. You're late. Sit down, sit down. All right, class. Settle down. This is an art school, so I'm teaching art. In painting, as in life, the secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. We never make mistakes. We just make happy accidents. What you'll got going on back there? Is that you? That's cute. Yikes! Run! Fire drill! Some people just don't understand the value of staying in school. Something dropped out of his pocket. - He's got pockets? - It's a compass. Not any old compass. A prismatic compass. - A kind used by geologists. - And land surveyors. Interesting. Boys, girls, and famous basketball legends, this mystery is really starting to come together. Well, folks, we're down to our last holes of golf, and our last remaing golfers. Seems that Swamp Monster has been very busy. So let's hope at least one of our golfers can survive till the end. - Yikes! - It's just me, Mr. Rogers. Dude! I can't believe I'm standing next to Shaggy Rogers! Legend of Shaggy pants! Like, whoa, man. Like, whoa! Like, okay, dude, take it easy. I'm just a regular dude. I just came by to warn you, dude. This place is cursed, man. That Swamp Monster is real, and it's gonna get everybody. Get out while you can, Mr. Rogers. Dude, it would be a terrible shame if the world lost a caddy like you. Yeah, shame. I don't think I can go through with this. What? You have to. Those kids are counting on us. I, I... I can't. Shaggy, remember, I saved your life. Okay, that's it. I need to know how Mr. Paul saved your life. Fine, Velma, but I warn you, I warn all of you. Like, it's a pretty challenging story to hear. The day Chris Paul saved my life was possibly the scariest day of my life. And that is saying something. I was in a tough fix. I didn't know how I was gonna survive. Things looked so bleak. It was the end of the road, and that's when... Chris Paul saved my life... by sharing his pizza with me. Wait. What? - That's it? - Makes sense to me. That saved your life? Dude, I was so hungry. - I hadn't eaten in like three or four... - Weeks? Hours! And, man, that was one crazy great pizza. - Boy! - Shoot, yeah. That pizza was bomb. And sharing it with my guy right here meant I made a friend. A friend for life. You're right, C.P., I'm in. Let's do this thing. Okay, here's the plan, Scooby. You stay with Shaggy and Mr. Paul, Velma, Daphne, and I will get the trap ready. Remember. It's vital you make it to the 18th hole. Hold on. Sorry there, Fred. What were y'all saying? We were just doing our fist bump thingy. Okay, the trap's set. - Nice shot, C.P. - Yeah. He's right there. The ball's right here, Scooby-Doo. No! Monster! Man, I don't know about you all, but I think we better pick up the pace. Why is that hat floating out there? Where did all the other golfers get to? Hello? Golfers? Golfers? There's somebody. - Or something. - Swamp Monster. Like, run! Run for our lives. I am not quitting. I'm the last golfer standing and I'm gonna finish this game. So, like, golf. Golf for our lives! Hit it! Hurry, Scoob, he's gaining on us. Speedy-Dooby-Doo! It's coming right at us! I got this. Chris Paul has the ball and he is driving for the hole. Like an ankle breaker. Yeah. Foul! That was totally a foul. Scooby, Shaggy, pull the flag. Run! Now, let's see who this Swamp Monster really is. The caddy? Searching local university records, I found our caddy here had been attending night school - as a land surveyor. - He saved all his tips and had accumulated a large sum of money. Working on the golf course gave him extensive knowledge of the underground aquifer system. You're darn right it did! I knew if I could make the school go under, I'd pick up the land for cheap and build a bunch of really expensive condos on it. I'd be rich. But what about the crazy monster strength? - How did that work? - It's all him. The costume made him look bigger, and years of caddying and swinging golf clubs - made him freakishly strong. - Total truth. Like being in a golf job gets you totally ripped, dude! Where did you think I got this hot bod? And I would have gotten away with it, too, if it wasn't for meddling basketball legend and assist king and bowling aficionado, Chris Paul, and caddying legend, Shaggy Rogers. It seems that the local police have rescued all the golfers taken by the Swamp Monster. Let's go live now to the moment we've all been waiting for. The final putt. All right, C.P. Sink that putt and save this school. I got this. Man! Man! Man! It's good!
