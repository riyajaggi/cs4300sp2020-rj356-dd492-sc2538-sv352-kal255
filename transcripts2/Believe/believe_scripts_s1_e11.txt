 Previously, on Believe... Look out! Put the gun down! Give me the gun! That bullet needs to come out, Miss Channing. - Who are you? - Dani? Her readings are the strongest we've seen since Bo. She's had a difficult past, Roman. Most of our subjects here have. Most of our subjects didn't kill their brother. Truth is, we don't know what she's capable of. Bo's a candidate to degrade, Roman, you have to admit that.

 Stop it! The more she channels, the more likely she is. To end up like her mother. Don't let me lose you just when I found you. Milton, do you hear that? Tate. Bo, help... Help me. Milton! Tate! What's going on? Why is she getting sicker? Her wound isn't healing. Is she going to be okay? She has an infection, Bo. What we've got to do is get her fever down. Oh...

 What? It's 104, almost 105. It's four degrees up since last night. She needs a hospital. No, no, I don't want to go. Miss Channing, you need a doctor. Or what? What's going to happen? Hey, you all right? I don't want her to die, Tate. Don't say that. And I can't stop thinking about what happened to... To who, Bo? Mom. She died because of me. Hey, don't think like that, okay? That's not right. But it's true. If I wasn't born, mom wouldn't be dead. You guys would be together, happy. Everyone would be safe. Channing wouldn't be shot. No, hey, look at me. Everything that's happened to us, all of us, we would do it all over again. That's how much we love you. That's how much. We believe in keeping you safe. But what's going to happen to me, if something bad happens to you? What are you talking about? Nothing's going to happen to me. Everyone who takes care of me gets hurt. Here, lay down. Nothing's going to happen to me, all right? - Tate? - Yeah? I don't want to run anymore. Sync & corrections by wilson0804 www.Addic7ed.com 104. Barely gone down. What are we going to do? She's going to die if we don't do something. That will not happen. Not again. What? What do you mean, "not again?" Winter? What do you mean, "not again?" What are you talking about? I have to go. I'm going to get some help. Yeah and how you planning on doing that, huh? You can't take her to a hospital, she'll spend the rest of her life in prison. We're checkmated, man. We're done. We are not done, Mr. Tate. Miss Channing will survive this, and I will be back. You have to trust me. When did you first notice it? Last night. It started leaking through my shirt sleeve. What are you doing? Just taking a little sample so we can send it away. And get it analyzed, dear. Notice it anywhere else? No. What the hell is going on? I don't want to speculate. You're worried I'm going to get worse. It's not polite to read people without their permission. Let's just wait for the results. Get me Dr. Skouras. - Ah! - Coffin nails, Brad. I thought you knew better. You're a doctor, for God's sake. Geez, you scared the crap out of me. What the hell are you doing here, Melvin? I need a favor. You're a fugitive. You're all over the news. The FBI is looking for you. Why would you put me in this kind of position? Because I don't have a choice, friend. Brad, please. Please? I'm sorry, sorry I just... I just, I can't do it. Yeah, I was hoping you wouldn't say that. So I've been thinking... We should go talk to Dr. Skouras. Talk to him? And what would we say? We would ask him to leave us alone. Yeah, I don't think he'd go for that. Why not? We'll appeal to the part of him that used to be good. So let's just go talk to him, eye to eye. Tell him how we feel. So you think it's a bad idea? No, I think it's a beautiful idea. So let's do it. Trust me. All right. I'm with you. It's time we take a stand. Sorry to bother you, Dr. Skouras. I've gotten results back from Dani Sullivan. How far has she progressed? Stage four. And I must say, I have never seen the disease come on this quickly, in any particular subject. As you know, the degrade is like a cancer... Slow in some subjects, faster in others. But the onset in Dani is remarkably aggressive. What have you told her about what was wrong? I said very little, per the policy with our subjects. If her condition changes in any way, let me know. Hey, no, no, no, no. Miss Channing, Miss Channing... Miss Channing, listen. This is Dr. taussig. He's a friend, he's here to help. Nice way to treat a friend. I'm sorry. So is she on anything? Uh, yeah. Vancomycin and morphine. Where'd you get that? I can be resourceful when I have to be. Well, it's a good thing. She'd have sepsis otherwise. Hey, I'm just going to have a look, okay? There are probably some pieces of the bullet. That are still in there, and that's what's driving the infection. So I'm going to need a maglite, towels, forceps... Where are Tate and Bo? Isn't Winter going to wonder where we are? Of course he is. That's why we've got to do this now, before I come to my senses. Well it says here Dr. Skouras is speaking at a gala. For the National Science Foundation. I bet it's some fancy hotel somewhere. You're right. It's at the hotel Naya. And if it's fancy, we can't go like this. How is it? It's great... If I could breathe. What's going on in there, by the way? I've never worn a fancy dress before. Well come on out, let's take a look at you. Why aren't you saying anything? You look beautiful, just like your mom. Thanks. Dani? How's my star pupil? Really? Your star pupil? Is everything okay? I heard you went to the infirmary today. - Yeah. - Everything check out okay? What's happening to me? I'm going to tell you the truth, Dani. I don't know. We've had some subjects come down with similar symptoms. We don't know what it is. We're working on it diligently. Don't worry. Okay, Dr. Skouras. I trust you. Well, kid, you ready? Last chance to back out. No, I'm ready. - You nervous? - Yeah. Yeah, me too. At least we're together. Hey kid, look, before we move on, I just wanted to say that... I wanted to say that... You love me? I can read your mind, remember? Oh yeah. All right, first thing we need is some credentials, so we're going to look for... All right, you see that guy right there with the briefcase - and the blue I.D.? - Mmhmm. That's our guy. We need to get that badge. Go do your thing. - Hi, are you Lilah's dad? - Uh, yeah. - How did you know that? - Oh, I go to school with her. St. Avenue Christian? In Florida? Yeah! In, um, Tampa. No kidding! That's a small world. What are you doing in New York? Oh, geez. I'm so sorry about that. - Let me help you with this. - No, no, it's fine, I got it. Apologize for that. I'm a little clumsy today. - Tell lilah I said hi. - I will. Hey, you have a good time in New York, okay? I will. Hey, what's wrong with your hand? - This? Oh, it's nothing... - Are you sure? Because I think I have something just like it. Thank you. The man I'm about to introduce likely needs no introduction. All right, look. See those guys. Right over there in the suits, and right over there? - Mm-hmm. - That's his security. - How do you know? - You see the earpieces? That's how they communicate with each other. - Hmm. - Are you listening? - This is important, Bo. - I'm listening. And has helped raise billions. For nonprofit organizations worldwide. Wait, wait, wait. Hey, hey, hey, it's okay. It's okay. I thought I could do it, but I'm too afraid. I'm afraid too. But we've got to stand up to this guy together. Before it's too late. I'd damn sure rather do it on our terms than his. Tate... Yeah? I love you too. I forgot to say that before. That... feels nice. Dr. Roman Skouras. Great. Where are you? I took the kid out for some fresh air. What is that noise? A, uh, street performer? You're out on the street? I'll be careful, okay, Winter? Just get Channing squared away, and then call me. Bo's too upset to see Channing in that much pain. All right. - Milton? - Yeah. We're good for about an hour or so. Thank you, Jim, for that very kind introduction. I'd like to take a moment. And talk about the human mind, if I may. Consciousness... One of the most complex and perplexing aspects of human existence. What is it? Okay, showtime, kid. You know, there are some who think that conscious experience. Lies outside of the main of scientific theory all together. Consciousness, simply put, is an awareness of who we are... At the moment, there is a great discussion. In the scientific community, called the "mind-body problem." She has an abdominal infection that's spreading, Milton. She needs antimicrobial therapy, surgery, long-term care. I mean, it's amazing that she's alive at all, but she needs to be in a hospital, now. We don't have that option. You have not changed at all. You are still so stubborn. Please, Milton, please, I beg you, just get her to a hospital. Look, if you won't, then at least let her decide. It's her life, not yours. Now I know you may have a healthy dose of skepticism. Some of these things I'm discussing seem a bit fantastical. There are those who believe that the conscious mind and the brain. Are the same. Go ahead, call it in. We are poised on the edge of a brave new world. This is an area that Skouras worldwide. Is exploring with great interest. So I leave you with this tantalizing thought... The future will exist beyond your wildest dreams. The impossible will become ordinary. Thank you very much. Oh, yeah. Thank you very much. Dr. Skouras, we've some communication malfunction. And we'd like to escort you to your vehicle immediately, sir, as a precaution. Of course. No, let go! Let... let go! You're hurting me! Please! You're hurting me, please! Ow! No, I don't want to go. I don't want to... Ow! Ow, no, I... I'm gonna be fine! No. Come on. I don't know what's wrong with this thing, sir. Maybe we should take another one. Yes. Hey, doc. 'Bout time we had a chat. Hello, Bo. Tell him what's on your mind, kid. And don't hold back. It's really so good to see you. We want to end this. We want to be normal. A family, with my dad. So can you please leave us alone? I want this to end as much as you do, Bo. Okay, then stop chasing us. You have a gift, Bo. A gift I need to help you understand. I think we've had enough help. Mr. Tate, do you realize how significant your daughter is? All I've tried to do... All I've ever hoped for... Is to give her a place where she can be protected, where she can belong. I belong with my dad. Of course you do. But this life... Running from the police, sleeping in bathrooms, that's no life for a family. You need to be with others like you, Bo. Who share the same gifts as you. Oh what, so she can be an experiment? So you can figure out a way to use her? I just want her to be safe. I can provide you a place where the two of you. Can be together as a family. You're a wanted man, Mr. Tate. I could have you exonerated. As long as you both come and live at orchestra, the government would be happy to drop any outstanding charges, as long as they knew she was safe. I can help you. Winter was right. You will say anything. I'll never take anything from you, you understand me? Winter. What has he done but put you in jeopardy. And force you to live like fugitives? He's taken care of me. I took care of you, Bo! Have you forgotten that? I created orchestra for you. You killed my foster parents. You shot Channing. And you pushed my mom too hard, so she died. Is that what he told you, Bo? That I pushed Nina too hard, and that's why she died? Do you really believe that's the truth? That Nina died because of me? She did, right, Bo? Because of him? Let me tell you something... Something I think you suspect. Deep in your heart... Winter was responsible for your mother's death. Don't you sense that to be true? Winter had nothing to do with it, she was sick because you pushed her too hard! No, I was trying to protect... You didn't protect her! You killed her. Just like you're trying to kill me. You come near my kid again, I'm gonna kill you. - We should go. - Yeah. Where? Quickly, quickly... Nothing out here. Where is she? There's no sign of anyone, sir. All right, downstairs, everyone. Downstairs, come on! Come on! I didn't know you could do that. - I didn't either. - Come on, let's go. Hey. You have to make a decision. You need more help than I can give you. No, no, I don't want to go. I know what they'll do to me. They're going to find out who I am, and they're going to arrest me. I don't want to spend the rest of my life in prison. You won't survive. If we don't get you to a hospital. Then find me one. Not here. Somewhere off the grid, where all of us can be safe. Somewhere far away. You can do that, right, Winter? It's not true, is it? Bo, I'm talking to you. Winter couldn't do that, could he? I don't know. I don't. - Yeah, it's me. - Change of plans. Don't go back to the houseboat. I need you to meet me at the Atlantic heliport, west 34th street. Heliport? Why? We need to be in the air, A.S.A.P. Miss Channing needs us. Just get there, right now. Well, what do you want to do? We could just leave, and not show up. No, we can't. We have to find out what the truth is. We picked up their vehicle. They're heading west towards Manhattan on the L.I.E. Have you contacted Zepeda? He's en route to intercept. What are you doing here? What are you hiding here? You can't be here! This is a restricted area! This will have to be reported to Dr. Skouras. I know what's happening to them. Let me go. Say it. I want you to say it. They're sick. Like this? Like me? We don't understand it. Once it starts, the sicker you get. - Until... - Say it! Until you die. Storm will be here any minute. Pilot says we've got to take off soon, or else we're not going to get out. He's got to wait five minutes. Here, I got her, I got her. You okay? - Zepeda, what's the update? - Half a mile back. I'll have them soon. Confirm the moment they're in custody. Slow down. What's that? Stop, stop. Dani? What are you doing out here? Waiting for you. I need to talk to you. Dani, there's a storm coming. Come into the car. We'll take you to your room. You lied to me. What are you talking about? You knew I would get sick. You knew, and you still pushed me to do more. I thought you cared about me. I do care. No. You only care about the little girl. I'm just something to be thrown away, like all the others in there. You're just like my parents. That's not true, Dani. I am working on a way to cure you. Stop your lies! What are you afraid of, Dr. Skouras? You're afraid of seeing. Everything you've built collapse. You're afraid of something happening to the little girl. Dani. Who the hell does this guy think he is? Go around if you wanna go! Out. Long time, no see. Bo, Bo, please, hurry, hurry, hurry.. Oh, sweetheart, come on. Where have you been? Hey, we've got to go. Otherwise the pilot won't fly us, come on. Where have you guys been? We went to see Dr. Skouras. You did what? Why would you do that? Why would you put her in danger like that? Winter, Tate, Bo, come on. The pilot says. We have to take off right now. I need to do something first. What's the matter? What's wrong? Is it true? My mom died because of you? Dr. Skouras, I'm just giving you my honest opinion about Miss Adams. I do not advise going forward. The drone test is in ten minutes. It's a risk to both the mother and the child. Do you realize who's downstairs? What it took to get the joint chiefs of staff here? Please, don't shoot the messenger. The bloodwork is conclusive. Her degrade is directly tied. To the use of her ability. Decay at the molecular level... You've made your opinion very clear, thank you. What do you think, Milton? I think we should think much more clearly about what we're doing here. We just need one more positive example of her ability. We'd be on our way, with everything we want. The generals are ready, sir. It's time. So we're going to go ahead with the test, agreed? Agreed. It's true, what Dr. Skouras said. So Nina died because of you? I don't know, and I'll probably never know. But what I do know. Is that I could have stopped that test, maybe saved your mom's life, and I didn't. So I will share the blame. For that terrible, terrible decision. But you have got to know... Both of you... Everything that I have done since that time... Getting you away from orchestra, putting you together. With your dad... Everything has been to atone for what I did. Listen to me. Before your mother passed, I promised that I'd take care of you, and I'd protect you, and I've done that. And I will till the day I die. Now, you know that if I could change the past, I would. And you know how much I care about you. But right now, we've got to get on that chopper. Bo, sweetheart, we've got to get in that chopper right now. We've got to, Bo. We've got to! Whatever you want to do, kid. I've got your back. I forgive you. But I'm not going with you. I'm going with my dad. - Milton? - Yeah? Take care of Channing. We've got to go. We've got to go. Go. Milton, it's Roman. I need your help. Sync & corrections by wilson0804 www.Addic7ed.com
