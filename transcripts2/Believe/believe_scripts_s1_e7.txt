 Previously on Believe... Bo is a very special little girl. Bo is a candidate to degrade, Roman. You have to admit that. Stop it! The more she channels, the more likely she is to end up like her mother. Do you have a problem with what I'm asking you to do? - Winter took her. - Enough. And I intend to use every resource at my command to recover Bo.

 You felt it when you first met her. So she has an effect on people, so what? She's your daughter. Bo is your daughter. She... she doesn't know? That'll be your privilege. What are you drawing? A children's story. That makes sense, since you're a... A child. Yeah. I know my audience. Look. Who are they? A king and a princess. They're trapped in their castle. Don't they have a knight or guards or someone

 who can bust 'em out? Blue. No. The monster ate them all. There's a monster? What kind of monster? One that lives in the chimney. Oh, you mean like... like Santa claus. Uh, no. Santa claus doesn't live in a chimney. So what... what happens to the... The king and the princess? Not sure yet, but I think they get out. Good. That's good. Five minutes, no more. We've put enough distance between us and Hudson. We've definitely lost the feds. Maybe we can set up a new safe house while we're here. Is that the McKenzie farm? Why did she draw that? I don't know. Proximity, maybe. We're not too far. We can't go there. I know that. I know that. [Toilet flushes] You're overwhelmed, you know. I understand. Really, Winter? Do you? You break me out of death row. We've got assassins gunning after us. And, oh, yeah, the little girl with the magic powers turns out to be my damn daughter. Why would that be overwhelming? Your daughter doesn't know she's your damn daughter. - Tell her. - Yeah. Here? At the gas 'n sip? Yeah, that's a good idea. Yeah, hey, guess what, Bo? I'm your dad. Yeah, that's... that's a great idea. You know what? I have a good idea. Why don't you tell me why you didn't think I should know? 'Cause I didn't know if it would work or not. I mean, you and her together, whether it would help or hurt, make her weaker or stronger. That's why. So which is it? Bo needs her father, and you need her. You mean, you need us. Excuse me. "Sprouted oat cake"? No trans fats. Lots of fiber. You make me sad, kid. Here. This is road food. No, you are not eating this poison, Bo. Please, Milton? - Just this once. - Yay! - Out the back now. - Come on. Come on. Go. Channing. Channing! Other side. Other side. [Screams] Get her in! Come on. Come on, Bo. Let's go. - Get in! - Come on, let's go! Let's go! Let's go! [Crying] It's okay. It's o... it's okay. - How's she doing? - I don't know! - My leg. - What is this, Channing? Channing, what is this? Zepeda hit her with a tranquilizer. Pull it out. I'm sorry, Bo. Hold on. - It's too slow in here. - Hey, hey, hey. No, no, no, no, no. Hey, hey, hey. Listen to me. Bo, listen to me. Stay awake, okay? Do not fall asleep. [Echoing] Not fall asleep. Keep your eyes open. The monster takes them away. [Monster growling] Then I'm all alone. The monster takes them away. [Airy, mysterious music] ♪ Sync & corrections by wilson0804 www.Addic7ed.com - Bo! - Bo, Bo, Bo, listen to me.. Stay awake, baby, okay? - Stay awake. - Keep talking to her, Mr. Tate. Zepeda. - Down! Down! - Keep your head down! We all good? We all good in the back? We good?! Winter, get us the hell out of here. [Gunshots] Hit the brakes! Hit the brakes! [Tires screeching] [Crash] Whoa! We got him. We should leave him here to rot. - We're not doing that. - Fine. It's better that he's with us. We can control him that way. Hey. How you feeling? It's too hot. She has a fever. - This is my fault. - This is not your fault. I let her go around the car by herself. You did nothing wrong. Do you understand me? We need to get off the road as soon as we can. I know a place close by. The wife is a nurse. - Winter. - Look, we don't have a choice right now. This is about Bo. It's a little excessive, don't you think? What's an innocent little girl gonna do, slip out in the middle of the night and run? This isn't about Bo. Oh, so Roman hired you because he thinks someone's going to get through fences, guards, rings of surveillance and security and climb through that window? It is my job to think of all possible angles of attack. Right. Head of security. Holding a little 9-year-old girl captive. Protecting a very important little girl. Don't you think she's important, Mr. Winter? I think she's very important, miss Channing. Maybe too important. Meaning? Meaning, all this isolation, testing demands, trials... don't you ever wonder? Wonder what? If a little girl should just... Be a little girl? Bo is a federal asset. She doesn't get to be a little girl. Oh, my God, Bo. She's in and out of consciousness. - What happened to her? - The guy in the back hit her with a tranquilizer dart. - Sarah. - Oh, my princess. I missed you. I missed you, too. Follow me. Hurry. Orchestra. We didn't have a choice, Karl. I'm sorry, Karl. We didn't... we had to come. - This is my room. - Yes, princess. Just the way you left it. I never stay very long. 99.6, low-grade. Has she been sick? She never gets sick. A sedative shouldn't trigger a fever. It could be a allergic reaction. Do you know what was used? No. Pulse is a bit slow. - Tate. - Yeah? I'm right here. Make sure to check on the chimney. Oh, don't worry, kid. I'm not gonna let the monster get you. I run and I hide, but the monster finds me. Bo, listen to me. It's gonna be okay. I won't let the monster anywhere near you. It's gonna get me. Tate, it's gonna get me. - Hey, hey, it's okay. - Shh. It's all right, sweetheart. Tate. - Channing. Channing. - Tate. Listen. Listen, he'll be right back, sweetheart. Tate. What'd you hit her with? [Thud] [Groans] - What was in the tranq?! - [Laughing] I think you just answered your own question. [Groans] You're not gonna win this. What was in the dart?! I don't know, all right? Some kind of a sedative. - Stop! - [Groans] Stop. He's no good to us dead, okay? Stop! Did the monster find him? No. There's no monster here, sweetheart. There's no monster here, Bo. There's no monster. No, no. There is. In the chimney. He gets us all eventually. He gets us all eventually. He gets us all. - Bo? - What's going on? Bo, I need you to stay awake. Okay, open your eyes, sweetie. - Stay awake, Bo. Come on. - Open your eyes, Bo. - Stay with us, honey bun. - Open your eyes. Keep your eyes open. You're okay. - Keep talking to us. - Can you hear me? - Keep talking to us. - What's happening? Get some water. - Okay. - You're okay. Okay? Milton? [Overlapping voices echoing] - Keep your eyes open. - Milton. Milton? Come inside, quick. - Where's Karl? - Milton! Sarah! Where are you? [Echoing] Where are you? We were worried when it got so late. Karl went out to look for you. We didn't know if you'd made it out of orchestra. Is Bo okay? She's fine. Hi, Bo. I'm Sarah. And I promise you, we are gonna take such good care of you. I know you are. So is Stanley. Oh, hi, Stanley. [Laughs] You guys rest now, okay? And don't worry about anything. You're safe now. What happened? Doesn't matter. We're here now, and Bo's protected, someplace where Skouras can never get to her. - Then you weren't followed. - No. - The plan worked. - Barely. I know it was difficult, but she's safe. [Gasps] You think I haven't failed in life? Failed her? Hmm? Think I haven't... I haven't hated myself for not anticipating a threat or seeing around the next corner or being just a second too slow... I sent her right to him, Winter. Right to him. - This is on me. - No, no. You can't see the future, Mr. Tate. Very few people can. [Sighs] We need to send her to a hospital. - No. - Why not? - We're not doing that. - Why not? Because they can't help her. She is beyond their science. They... she is beyond their science. Don't you know that? What aren't you telling me? Winter. We call it the degrade. It's what happens to people like Bo when they've overused their powers. It's like a... Car engine overheating. And that's what she has? Possibly. The symptoms mimic a coma with a very, very high fever. Okay, so if you know what it is, why the hell don't you fix it? Make the call. Winter. Oh, no. Whoever it is, you're gonna make the call. Right now. If you can get help, you're damn well gonna get it. All right. But not here. They will trace this phone. Go. I'll secure the farm. We have no other option. All right. All right, come on. Come on. I never stopped thinking about you, princess. So many reminders. Sometimes it's a sound or a smell. [Laughs] Every time I see a butterfly. We never talk about that night, but it's always there, no matter how hard we try to forget. I had to let you go once. I can't let you go again. Please, Bo, come back to us. [Eerie music] ♪ [Shattering sound] I shouldn't have skipped those juggling classes in college. [Laughs] What class didn't you skip? [Laughs] Sarah, Karl. They won't hurt me. Just don't fight them, okay? [Whooshing] Don't hurt them. Don't hurt them! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Watch your speed. We can't help Bo if we get pulled over, right? Go ahead, ask me. It was Nina, right? Bo's mom. Nina Adams? Yes. Was she like Bo? No one's like Bo. She was. Everybody loved her like they love Bo. They were drawn to her. So what happened? Nina died in childbirth. We far enough yet? Almost. Almost. [Cell phone rings] Yes? Do you recognize my voice? My God. Milton. Zoe, I need your help. I can't. Roman wants you dead. Well, I'm not dead yet. But if I don't get your help, Bo will be. Zepeda hit her with a tranquilizer a few hours ago. She's unresponsive, unconscious. She has a high fever, pulse is weak, blood pressure is low. A tranquilizer should have worn off by now. - Is it the degrade? - I don't know. Zoe, please. Please. I believe that Bo is dying. I don't have anybody else to turn to. Where are you? Should be everything you need in here. Is that my doorbell? Was. I need the wireless transmitter to set up an alarm in the perimeter. Mm-hmm. Never thought we'd see her again. We got word from Winter she was safe, but we couldn't risk contact. I can't believe he brought her here. Put us, put her in that kind of danger again. Hey, monkey. I got a good ol' game of chutes and ladders for you. As soon as you're up. As soon as you're up, okay? [Door slams] - Karl... - They found her. Go. No, Karl! Don't fight! [Grunting] No! Karl! [Coughing] No! [Echoing] Four months ago, was it you that took Bo away from us? Attacked my wife? Left me for dead? You really have no idea, do you? [Laughs] I know it sounds cliche, but... [Laughs] Boy, have I got a story for you. I don't need to hear your stories. No scar. It wasn't you. No. No, it wasn't, but I can tell you who it was. Hey. We're secure. - Thank you. - Yeah. I'm sorry. About before. I understand. Don't be. Sorry isn't for tomorrow. Sure you can trust this chick? Zoe helped me raise Bo. She cares about her very, very deeply. Bo is our common ground, you know? Now. So what was your common ground back then? Killing people? No, Mr. Tate. Roman Skouras and I built orchestra to stop the killing, force tyrants down, sway minds and to save the world. Think, you know, no more war, famine, disease... those were our dreams. [Scoffs] Well, doesn't seem like that worked out. At all. So this doctor, you think she's gonna show up? She's already here. [Line rings] [Ringing] Yes. Walk towards the station. You have 20 seconds. - Or what? - Zoe, please. You're being followed. Roman wouldn't do that. Every time you walk out of orchestra he has eyes on you, don't you know that? - How is she? - Not better. If it's the degrade, why don't you just let me take her home? Orchestra is not her home. I can take care of her there. We have doctors. We have a medical facility. Five seconds. Go inside, walk to the platform, turn right at the overlook. So what the hell just happened? [Knock on window] Magic. Hello, Zoe. Roman trusts me. Why would he have me followed? He used to trust me, too. No one cares. Can you help Bo? It was your people that did this to her. Can you help her or not? Mr. Tate. Zoe, if it wasn't the tranquilizer, and if it is the degrade, what would trigger that? Extreme emotional stimulus. Oh, you mean, like someone shooting at her? Please. Did she display any powers? After she was shot, no. Did you consider that maybe her condition's a manifestation? Is that possible? Milton, with Bo, anything's possible. Wait a second. Wait, you're telling me that Bo's in a coma that she created? Like it... like it's one of her spookies? Why the hell would she do that? She can't control her gifts. How they manifest is completely unpredictable. Tate, Bo is connected to the world on a level that... You can't understand. The pain that she felt when she was shot or the fear that she felt when she slipped from consciousness, those heightened emotions, those are triggers for her powers. So how do we help her? This is an expressive monoamine transporter. It's still improving, but we've run some trials attempting to bring victims of the degrade to the surface. If you can get through to her, give her a reason to come back... so once we give that to her, how long does it take? If it's just one of Bo's manifestations, and if it works... instantly. But if it is the degrade, we'll just have to wait and see. Please, Milton, just let me take her to the campus. Please. It's the safest place for her. I'm begging you. I can take care of her there. Yeah, but what will Roman Skouras do? Do you know what he will do? The Bo that you love, the Bo that we both love, he will exploit her gifts, just like he did to Nina. And Bo will die, Zoe. Zoe, you gotta trust me. Trust me. We gotta go. Thank you. Gotta go. [Beep] 103. They'll be back soon. If her temperature gets above 105 or 106... [cocks rifle] She's the one, the one who attacked us that night, the one who took Bo. - What? - I saw the scar. I'm not that person anymore. I don't care. Move away from Bo. Was it you? I don't understand what's going on here, but as soon as Winter gets back, I'm gonna tell him. Winter already knows. He knows everything. [Bo whimpers] And he knows I would never hurt Bo. [Heavy breathing] [Shuffling footsteps] What are you doing? Helping you. Why? Because I know who you are. You don't know me. I know who you're going to be. I'm so sorry. Don't be sorry. Why? Because sorry isn't for tomorrow. Bo just came up with that one day. Sorry isn't for tomorrow. It was sort of her catchphrase. Winter was on our tail. He was minutes behind me... And then he took us away. He saved my life. Bo changed my life. I love her. We love her, and you have no right. You have no right! I can't change what has happened. But Bo showed me I can change what will happen. What's her temperature? 105, half an hour ago. Is it supposed to start working right away? - Yes. - If it works. - It will work. - No, Zoe said that it would... it would... it would only bring her to the surface. Whatever the hell that means. She should regain enough consciousness to where she can hear or feel us. If we can reach her or contact her... wait, wait. So what, we're suppose... we're supposed to just ask her to come back? Exactly. Bo. Princess, open your eyes, okay? Karl and me, we're all here waiting for you. Winter, Tate... all here for you, honey. - Nothing's happening. - Give it time. No, Winter, it's not working. We need to bring her to orchestra. We will not bring her to orchestra! They will not save her. 106. Winter. What does that mean? Brain damage, organ failure. She cannot survive like this. We can't just... Winter, we're outta options. We're never out of options. We are never out of options. You gonna tell me where I can find orchestra? I can't do that, my friend. Yeah, didn't think so. My friend. I didn't mean the girl any harm. Just so you know. That's great. I don't really care. Right now... I need your help. - Help you do what? - Save Bo's life. You're taking us to orchestra. Turn around. What's the plan? The plan is, you don't try anything. Oh? Or you're gonna kill me? But then you'd lose your ticket to orchestra. And you lose your chance to be the hero... the guy who captured Bo. So it's a zero sum game. And honestly, I really enjoyed our time together. Shut up. Let's move. - What the hell are you doing? - Wait, Channing! Are you insane? You can't trust him. Okay, stop! I'm sorry. Go, get Bo. Go! [Thud] [Grunts] [Groans] I'm so sorry, sweetheart, that I can't just blink and take all your pain and put it on my shoulders. But whatever happens, I know that you understand, that you'll forgive me, my failings. You'll get through this, Bo. I believe that. I believe you. Touching. Really. - Channing! - [Grunts] Uhh... ah! Channing. Get out of my way, Tate. I'm not gonna do that. - Get out of my way! - That's not gonna happen! Put her down. You don't want to do that, Karl. You people are not taking her away from us again. Put Bo down. Or what? [Hammer clicks] What is that, a 12 gauge? 5 feet between us no choke in the barrel, that's a 3-, 4-inch spread. I'd say there's a good chance you'll hit the girl. - [Grunts] - [Screams] [Screams, groans] - No! - Ah! Aah! Tate! Tate! [Grunts] Ah! Ah... Karl. Karl, no. No, don't do it, Karl. Don't shoot him, Karl. Don't do it. Don't do it. Back away. Mr. Zepeda, you have one shot left in that gun, and there are three of us. I'm well aware of that, Winter. But there's only one Bo. Like I said, back away. What the hell are you doing? This wasn't the deal. Sue me. [Panting] Move. Move! Don't make me say it again. Move.. You can't shoot us all. Oh, God, no. No, Bo, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't know what else to do. I didn't know what else to do. Tate, I thought you left me. Where are we? Where the monster lives. The monster takes everything from me. Bo... You've already lost more than anyone ever should. But you're not gonna lose me. You're not. You're my dad, aren't you? [Air whooshing] Don't let me lose you just when I found you. Don't let me lose you. Don't let me lose you. It's okay. It's okay. You're okay now. [Sighs] - Hey, feeling better? - Yeah. Good. Did you brush your teeth? Yeah. One minute, each side. Excellent. Does it hurt? No. Sorry. Hey, it's not your fault. It's not. Into bed, sweetheart. It is late. [Groans] [Both laughing] All right, I'll see you in the morning, okay? All right. Miss Channing. We almost lost her. You know what? Mr. Tate saved her life. Bo just needed to know that Tate was her father and that he'd always be there for her. That's what brought her back. - Well, you were right. - About? About picking the right moment. For Tate to tell her? That wasn't me, miss Channing. I really wasn't sure. Bo was. She picked the moment, not me. Get some sleep. - For Bo. - Great. Hey, Tate. About Zepeda, what you were trying to do... I didn't understand. Would you have helped if you did? All right. I'm gonna get good at these tuck-ins. I'm gonna get good at these. There you go. Thank you. You're welcome. When we first met back at the hospital, you said something to me. That you remembered you were good once. Yeah. Listen, if I was good, when I was, that's where you came from. Not the bad part of me. I know. Sleep tight. Don't let the bedbugs bite. Tate. Yeah? It's gonna be okay. I believe you. Good night, Tate. Good night, kid. Sync & corrections by wilson0804 www.Addic7ed.com
