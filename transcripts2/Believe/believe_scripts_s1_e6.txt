 - Previously on Believe... - Inexplicable phenomena have been part of Bo's life. People who try to kidnap her, they think that whoever controls her abilities will control the world. I want you to take good care of her. You're gonna be raising her now. How's Joshua? It's too early to say. I couldn't help what happened. He was bleeding. I did it. Sean has suffered severe behavioral

 and emotional problems due to his ability. But over the last three years, we've worked hard to help him harness his gifts. How's that? You have such a long history of violence, Mr. Tate. Now you're being executed for two counts of felony murder. You know what happens when you believe in people? - Your so-called friends? - Enough! Why do you think I'm here? I keep reading in the papers about how I'm a murderer. Yeah, well, some day the truth's gonna come out. And then there's gonna be hell to pay. - Tate? - Yeah. I know you have to leave.

 So you can go now. Nah. What the hell's going on here, Patty? - Yo, man, I don't know what that was. - This was supposed to be easy. Nobody was supposed to be here. The money's in the safe. The safe's in the back room. Remember you telling me that, no trouble? What the hell happened? There was supposed to be - no problem. - We gotta figure it out, man. - We gotta do something. - What are we gonna do? There's two... there's two bodies in there. Dead. And our fingerprints are all over the place. Look, I know, I know! But we didn't do it, all right? But nobody's gonna believe us. Your own mother would toss you over, for crying out loud. We gotta get rid of the bodies, man. We gotta toss them in the river or something. - Are you nuts? - I'm serious, man. We gotta wipe it clean, everything... wipe it all down. - We'll never get everything. - Then we burn the place down! - The whole bodies and everything. - Shut up! People know that we were here. Okay? Half of our friends know. You were over at dead Tommy's last night blabbing about everything, remember that? How we had this easy job to get? You're not gettin' it. We can't hide. Then what are we supposed to do, bro? Oh, my God. Tate, talk to me, man. Tell me what to do here. Look, it's just us two. You and me, right? We gotta tell them like it happened. - I'm not going down for this! - No, no. We take the hit for the breaking and the entering. Okay? Good behavior, we'll get out in two years, Max. - No, no, no. - Listen to me! Listen! The only way we're getting out of this mess is if we have each other's backs. All right? You understand? Hey, don't worry, Billy. I got your back. "Watching the occasional light dart "in random directions across the walls... "As long as I can remember, our house has always been filled with pictures of me." Hey, Tate? Tate's gone. And somehow he got his tracker off. Did you do this? Yeah. You want to tell me why? Tate needed to go home. Bo's gift is unique, yes. But I assure you, we are working with other very gifted individuals. The program has not been hindered by her absence. In fact, we have one subject, Sean, who is showing great progress and is a leading candidate to replace Bo. Dr. Skouras, thank you for making room in your schedule to update this committee. I don't need to tell you how time-sensitive your project is. I understand the requirement, general. Hey, pop. Get the hell out of my house. All I want's a gun and to know where Pat Farnsworth is. That's all? You plan on going after Patty and getting yourself... Empty. Still too cheap to buy shells, huh? Get out. You made my life hell then - and ever since. - I made your life hell? You killed two men in this town. You have any idea how people look at you when - they think your son's a killer? - I didn't do it. Well, the whole town and a court of law thinks otherwise. Where's Patty? Where is he? Patty and your old crew hang out at Flynn's. You wanted to get dead, you should've stayed on death row. That painting is so pretty. Maybe one of those men did it. This is Tate's hometown, Bo. It's called Hudson. Turn left at the next light. I'm all out of Halloween candy. Uh, Mr. Tate, my name is Milton Winter. My associate, Ms. Channing. We're from the Pennsylvania corrections department. Now, if you'd open the door, we just have some questions. Haven't you people pestered me enough? I don't know where he is. We're not like those other people, Mr. Tate. All we want is to find your son and persuade him to turn himself in... that's it. Yeah, so he can go back and get the chair, huh? I want nothing to do with this or my son. - Wait, wait. - You're Tate's dad. I can tell. You're angry like him. - I'm not angry. - That's what he says. - She his kid? - No, she's mine. You don't water your plants, do you? So what's your interest in my boy? All I want to do is find your son and keep him out of trouble. Yeah. It's a bit late in the game for that. Holy hell. Billy, you shouldn't be here. Where is he? Where's Patty? - Don't know. - Just tell me where he is or we're gonna have a problem. Always with the entrances. Jack Callahan. - How you doing, buddy? - Billy Tate. - You okay? - Yeah. I wish I could say I miss having you around, brother. I figured you'd be calling the shots in Hudson. I'm guessing Patty's working for you now. Why don't you give him to me? I can't do that. I need to protect my people. - Besides, he did his time. - Well, not for murder. I did that for him. He's the reason I went to prison. Is this about clearing your name? I had something else in mind. Having your best friend turn on you is tough. I get it. But you need to let that go. You being back here isn't good, Billy, for anyone. Hey, Patty. Ah, perfect. Tate, don't do it. Someone must've called you in. Out the back. Get in! Get in! Get in! Sync & corrections by wilson0804 www.Addic7ed.com Do you think Joshua will recover? I don't know. We've never had a subject degrade this suddenly. No one's ever been a focus of an attack by Bo. Bo didn't attack anyone. I was hoping Joshua's recent progress would satisfy some of our military friends. They're expecting results sooner now. We'll have to concentrate our efforts on Sean. No. No, no. No, Sean is too fragile. You've seen how unstable he is. One wrong move, he could snap in two. He needs to accept and embrace his abilities, Zoe. No, you're pushing him too hard. You pushed Joshua too hard. - You pushed Nina too hard. - This is about Bo, isn't it? We don't know what will happen to her, Roman. She's still growing. Out in the world, we're making her use her abilities prematurely. We are forcing her to protect herself. To protect Tate. Winter is clever. He knew there was a good chance Tate would amplify Bo's abilities. I wonder if Tate's presence is protective as well. But we've got no data to prove that. Let me handle Sean. Right now, he's our only option. I'll push him as far as it takes. What the hell do you think you're doing? None of your business. Do you have any idea the kind of danger - you just put us in? - Well, I didn't ask you - to come looking for me, did I? - I met your dad. What? Your dad. He's nice. - Why don't you like him? - Oh, I don't know, maybe because he's a miserable, angry person. Hmm. Sounds familiar. I'm nothing like him, okay? Maybe he's changed. Maybe he's different. Whatever. It doesn't matter now anyway. It's never too late. Get down. Cops have this entire city on lockdown. Road blocks at every exit. Well, maybe you can get little girl wonder here to use her voodoo powers and throw some cops in the freaking gutter. Why can't I throw you in the gutter? You know what? You're not funny. I wasn't trying. So you're gonna do something or not? - Not. - Why? 'Cause you can't leave. What are you talking about? You can't leave until you know the truth. I know the truth. My dad is a no-good bum. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - And all my friends put me... - blah, blah, blah, blah. - Enough. Miss Channing, we have got to find a place to lay low quickly. Mr. Tate, your father's house? This is the last place we need to be right now. - Do you understand the danger? - Yes, I understand the danger. I'll do what needs to get done. And then I'm gone. I'm guessing you people aren't prison officials or anything official. But my home is not a sanctuary for fugitives, so I want you to get out. Little lady, be careful over there. - Is that you? - Yeah, that's me. Better years. - You taught Tate how to fight. - Yeah. He hit me. I learned to hit him back. It's the best way to train. You look cool, bruiser. Well, I had my moments. You didn't like hurting them. Hey, guys, I was gonna say this place is secure, but we have two agents inbound. Get away from the windows. Bo, Bo, come here. You think he's thick enough to show up around here? Hudson's a prideful lot. Doubt he'd hole up with his old man. Senior didn't take the stand or visit him in prison. No love lost. Oh, the funeral home is down on canter. I haven't heard that one. Agents Martin and Garner. Sorry to drop by so late. We got a call from local P.D. after an incident down at Flynn's bar. Oh, I haven't had a drink in years. Pat Farnsworth hangs out at Flynn's. Farnsworth testified against your son. Sir, we know William Tate is back in town. You're right. He is. After all, I am William Tate. Cuff me now. Shh! Mr. Tate, sir, have you had any contact with your son since his escape? I haven't spoken to my son since his arrest and we had few choice words before that. We don't do family gatherings. Sir, do you recognize this man? He posed as a priest and aided in your son's escape. Yeah. That's the ugly bastard that knocked me out in '86. If you have any contact... Doubtful. But if I do, I'll be sure to ring you right up and get that reward. Tell him we're not going away. Now they know you're here, too. - Thank you. - Don't thank me. You got a day before I make that call. Can't remember the last time you made my life any easier. Everybody, quick! Let's move! Out the back! Out the back! Out the back! Everybody, move! Move! Go! Keep going! Move! Move! Everybody, go! Go! Quickly! This is your fault! Now they're after me and they won't stop! - You did this! - No! But I know who did. If people ask, you held me against my will 'cause that's pretty much what's happening. This is the place from your boxing photo. Yep. I trained here as a youngster. Ran it as an adult. Closed down years back. Hey, hey. Be careful in there. - Don't worry, I will. - Are we safe here? Everything shut down for blocks. Nobody comes by here anymore. Hey! Listen, Mr. Tate, we do this your way, you will end up back in the penitentiary. Do it my way, we'll all get closure and we'll also all get safe. I'll be back. It's a beautiful day, isn't it, Sean? I suppose it is. Days like this remind us how lucky we really are. Don't you think? What do you want from me? I need your help, Sean. Remember when you first got here? Yes. You could barely speak, and now look at you. You've come so far. Do you think you could go farther? I think you can. I can't see anything. To see, we have to believe that we are exceptional. And you're not there yet. Concentrate. Come on! Stop! I don't like this. I don't like the way you're talking to me. Keep trying. Don't be weak. Don't call me weak. Don't ever call me weak. We'll try again when you're feeling stronger. Okay, good. Come on. Is that all you got? Extend your arm all the way in the jab. You want to keep that opponent back. That's it. Good. Okay, now uppercut. And twist. Oh, you've got the moves. Find anything? So there's no initial listings on Pat Farnsworth. No last known, no nothing, but don't worry. - We're on it. - Of course not. He's probably on somebody else's lease. Thank you. Thanks for looking though. The sooner we find him, the sooner we go. Agreed. I'm gonna go get some fresh air. So are you two a thing? What? No! Can we play chutes and ladders? You and Tate can be on the same team. Maybe that will make you nicer to each other. Tate? Tate? Tate? Where'd he go? Thanks, Al. Hey, I'll get you next time. How you've been, Meg? Oh. What the hell you doing, Billy? I need to know where Patty is. I don't want anything to do with this. Meg, he torched my dad's place. He tried to scare me off. Crazy bastards, both of you. Look, I'm sorry about big bill, but this is not my problem. You know I didn't kill those people. All I want is to find out where Patty is, and then I vanish. Does Patty vanish too? I just got to know why. - Hey. - Hey. Any news? There's no way out of town. Police and FBI everywhere. And there is still no sign of our friend, T. Without his ankle bracelet, and there's no way to track him. How's Bo doing? She's quiet. Too quiet. Bo, Bo. Listen. I know you're worried. Let me see if I can explain all this to you. What Tate is doing, I can't really blame him, you know. He's carrying this burden, this weight of not knowing. I felt something similar in my own life. Don't be too disappointed in him, Bo. You said he couldn't leave until he knew the truth. - You said that. - I know, but... I wish he wouldn't do it by himself. I wish he would ask us for our help. And that's what's bothering you, that he didn't ask for help? I want to help him and his dad. Do you know where he is? You know where Tate is right now? Yeah. Ugh! I should burn you up like you did my old man's place! The hell you talking about? Seven years, Pat! Seven years and for what? Huh? For what? In and out! A snatch and grab! You framed me for the murders! You made me take the fall! You told that jury a bunch of lies! After all we've been through, Pat. Why'd you do it? It's a whole hell of a lot bigger than us, man. - Hey! - I didn't do it! I didn't kill those people, and I didn't set you up! I swear to God, it wasn't me, Billy! Billy! I was just doing what I was told! You want... you want some truth? Jack knows. He knows the truth. Please, please don't... I couldn't believe it was Pat that turned on me. We did everything together. Everything. We stole cars together. It was him and me and Jack against the world in those days. And when Pat took the stand, I was sure he was behind it all. And now I just... I don't know. You should sleep. I'm not sleepy. The sun's out. Well, give it a shot. Nap time. I'm too old for naps, Tate. You're bad at tuck-ins. Yeah. Why do you have to hurt people? - Well, sometimes you have to. - No, you don't. Well, he lied to me. He deserved it. You know that's not the truth. Oh, what? And you know? Yeah. I do. You could spot a liar from a mile away, couldn't you? You're like a... Little human lie detector. Break a guy out of prison just so he can come back to settle a score? Yeah, I don't buy it either. Naw, we're missing something. We should update local P.D. After we find out what she knows. Megan Kannird was in Tate's circle of friends. No doubt she's heard something. Hi. Are you out? Want one of mine? Megan? Didn't do anything, don't know anything. I grew up near here. A different neighborhood, same code of silence. Of course, flash a few bills, and those rules start to bend. I don't have any cash on me, but... Do have a badge. Cuffs. Should we search her? What you wanna know? Billy Tate came home. You know him. You know his crew, you know who he's after. I want to know what you know. Why do you care so much about me and my dad? Because you have more in common than you think. You're not exactly like him, but sometimes you feel the way he feels. What are you talking about? Left behind. Alone. Listen. I'm sorry I left you behind. I know. I'm sorry for what you saw me do. With the gun. I don't understand. You're different from them. Uh... Maybe not. But I need your help. Only if you promise not to hurt anyone. Promise? Promise. Promise. Hey. You're still in town. Looks like you found a friend. Hello, there. Jack, Bo. Bo, Jack. It's a long story. But, well, she keeps me honest. Sure. What can I get you, little lady? Shirley temple, please. So you own this place, huh? I took it over after my uncle passed. I thought I'd try going the honest route. You and I should've gone down that road a long time ago. - Here you go, miss. - Thank you. You should be far away, Billy. You being here isn't good. It isn't good for you, for your dad, for this town, and having the feds around ain't good for me. Caught up with Patty. I heard. He didn't have the answers I wanted. Otherwise, I would be gone. Well, what answers might those be? Who did it? Who set me up? Why? Was it you? That's just like Patty to blame someone else. I didn't have anything to do with it. Well, Patty says otherwise. Patty would say anything to keep you from putting a bullet in his dome. Now, you've always been like a brother to me. And you still are. And you know why I never visited you? Guilt. You got jammed up. I've been sailing smooth for seven years, and I couldn't do anything to help you. Now I can. That's 50,000. That's how much your bounty is. That's what's on your wanted poster. That's a new life. 50 grand, huh? I was staking you. You take it... Leave town. Don't come back. I don't want to see you hurt. Thanks. Let's go. Be safe, Billy. He's lying, isn't he? He didn't give you all that money to start over. He gave it to you because he wants you to go away. He feels bad about something that he did. Something that he can't tell you. Son of a bitch. Jack was like a brother to you and he did this. That is hush money, Billy. Ask Bo, Winter. She was there. Jack lied to me. He set me up. I'm not saying you're wrong, but you have it, you have your answer. Why risk more for vengeance? If Bo wasn't with me, I would've settled it - right then and there. - It is settled. No, it's not. I need the whole story. It's just gonna drag me down if I leave not knowing. I need to do this alone. I know what you want to do. I'd want to do it too, but it fixes nothing. Believe me. I don't have time for this. He needs to know why Jack turned rat on him. Hey, Billy! Look. I'm not gonna give you a "I've been a lousy father" speech. But you've been a lousy father. After you went away, I was a damn pariah. In my home, I had a stigma on me. I wanted to leave. I tried to, believe me. This place is all I got. I have to be here. I'll always be here. But you don't. You can go. But settle your affairs before you do. For all of our sakes. Bo. I'm not sure I can keep that promise we made. Look at him, Sean. Look at Joshua, your friend. This is what happens when we fail. Look. What's that? You have no idea how much it hurts. Sean, I can't imagine how you feel, but I believe your extraordinary gifts will prevent untold pain across the globe. Joshua understood that. He believed. He was willing to do what he had to do because he knew our cause was right. I need you to believe in yourself. In our mission here. If you don't, you'll never be able to honor Joshua's sacrifice and his pain will have been for nothing. I need you to show me you have the strength to do what it takes... To do whatever it takes. Sean, end his suffering. You understand me, Sean? I told you to leave town! Don't do anything stupid, Billy. - Drop it. - Put it down now! I guess we're not going out for striper today, huh? No, we're not. What happened to dead Tommy? Dead Tommy? He's dead. All you had to do was take the money, Billy. - You could've gotten out. - I need to know the truth. Tell me why you did it, Jack. Does it matter? I spent my 20s locked up in a cell. And that whole time, all the way up to the dead man's walk, I never thought it would be you. - So, yeah, it matters. - I killed those people. They were stealing from my uncle before I took over. Oh, so you're just throwing me under the bus, huh? Yeah, I told Pat we'd do well if he got in line. Yeah, how's that working out for you, Pat? You got a boat? A bar? You like almost taking a bullet for someone else? - So you choose him over me. - Hell no. I was happy to let you both go down. But Pat turned on you, Billy. Billy's mom was an artist, you know. The two of them would spend hours drawing together. - Tate likes to draw? - Not anymore. I don't know. He liked it well enough when he was your age. He took it pretty hard when she passed. He blamed you. I wasn't perfect. I did love her, though, in my own way. You should tell Tate that. Maybe. Bruiser? That's one scary-looking dragon you got there, kid. Tate's in trouble. - He's always in trouble. - No, right now. We have to go find him right now. There's something wrong! Milton! Channing! What is it? What is it, Bo? It's Tate. What? Does any of this mean anything to you? The water, the boat? Anything? Jack's got a boat he keeps up at the docks. That's where he takes people. - We have to go. Come on. - Let's go. - Are we far? - No, it's not far. I'm sorry it had to be you, Billy. Come on, we have to do this, Jackie? He didn't know. I mean, it's not his fault. You like what he did to your face? You like the feds taking up residence? Now you may not care about yours, Pat, but my standing in this town took a serious hit the second he showed up. Now I gave him a chance to leave. And he chose this. So do it! Don't. Don't do it. Patty, don't do it. It's only a matter of time before it's you hitting the water. You know that. You know that, Patty. You can start making decisions for yourself. Or you can do as you're told. It's your choice. Don't do it. Don't. Don't. Jack's boat... Not there. Cut me loose. It's been eating away at me for years, man. I shouldn't have done it. Yeah, when we get out of this, we'll call it even. Deal? And Pat, sorry about your face. You should be the one to put him down. This how you want to end it, Billy? There. You need to forgive Tate. It's too late for that. He didn't kill anyone. I know. Bo. We have to leave, sweetheart. Come get your things. Tate! - You're alive! - Oh! Hey. Hey. I'm okay. Billy, I thought you were... Yeah, so did I. Patty and I made it outta there. Maybe... Maybe we can do better, Billy. Okay. All right, Winter, can we blow this pop stand? Yes, we can. Wait. We can't leave yet. I know what happened, Bo. The whole story. No. Not your story. Winter's story. All right. What story's she talking about? All of it. Taking the GPS tracker off you, letting you come home. Okay, what is this? Some kind of riddle, Winter? I've been around that little girl for most of the last ten years. And right now I am amazed. Okay, so what's the damn secret? You don't feel it? I'm feeling a lot of things right now. What she's talking about is a burden that I've been carrying for many, many years. It's a burden of truth. But she's right, it's time that somebody else carried that burden... you. So? Enlighten me. You felt it when you first met her. You must have. Okay, so she has an effect on people. - So what? - So what? It's different with you. Okay, then just spit it out. She's your daughter... Mr. Tate. Bo... Is your daughter. Does it make sense now? She... she doesn't know? That'll be your privilege, Mr. Tate. Dr. Skouras, you're back. What's the update? Don't worry, General. Everything is being taken care of at Orchestra. The candidate that I told you about, Sean, has just been given his first field assignment. Let me remind you that your project exists at our discretion. And yet you haven't used a dime of taxpayers' money. Not the point. Let me remind you, general, that this is my program. You are building a weapon, Dr. Skouras, that falls squarely under our purview. So... Do we have our weapon or not? Beyond a shadow of a doubt. You will have your weapon, General. Very soon. It's okay. What is? Whatever you're worried about. I'm sorry about what happened before. You never should've seen me like that. That's who you were. It's not who you are now. Tate, I forgive you. Sync & corrections by wilson0804 www.Addic7ed.com
