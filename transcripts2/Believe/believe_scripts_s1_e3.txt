 Believe (2014): Season 1, Episode 3 - Origin - full transcript 
 Roman Skouris invites his onetime partner and friend Milton Greene to a coffee shop and suggests they set their differences aside and start over. Milton will have nothing to with him and accuses him of just using Bo and her powers for his own self aggrandizement. Flashbacks to 10 years ago show how they began their work together with Bo's mother, Nina Adams. She had powers similar to Bo's and tells Milton she is pregnant. Milton promises Nina he will always protect her child. In the present day, Tate and Bo arrive in New York City. The FBI are quickly onto them and they're forced to leave the safe house. Tate stole a woman's wallet and then returned it for a reward. In the process, he stole a valuable necklace that once belonged to the woman's dead son. When trying to pawn the necklace, Bo comes to understand why she was drawn to that particular shop.

 Feds have made a move. It's an Amber alert. Milton Winter. He's cunning, he knows your move before you do. Well, then he knows you should back off and let me do my job. You keep thinking like that you'll never find her. I can't believe you used to be partners with that guy. Well, the past is a very tricky place, my dear. [Bell dings] I wasn't sure you'd come, Milton. I almost didn't come after yesterday. I supposed our approach has been a bit aggressive. They're mercenaries, Roman, going after a little girl.

 They wouldn't have harmed her. They almost killed her father! Which is why I felt it time for a truce. Well, here we are. Here we are. How's Bo? Exhausted. Does she know Tate's her father? You're asking me that because... You like your secrets, don't you, Milton? What are we doing here, Roman? Really. Remember this? Yes. That was the beginning. Just the three of us... you, me, and Nina. Now don't you think she knew about Bo? She knew that her daughter was gonna be very, very special. I'm sure of that. So doesn't Bo deserve a chance to be truly extraordinary? You forgotten what happened to Nina? No. Of course not. You don't care about Bo, Roman. You're using her like a... a pawn. We've had this argument a thousand times. And that's why I left! With Hayden and Gilman and Leeds. We couldn't abide any of this. I didn't come here to pick old wounds. Our time has passed. What do you want? What do you want, Roman? I'm offering you a final opportunity. To do what, to turn myself in? To do what's right! To honor what we built... you, me, Nina. To honor her, Milton. I am honoring Nina by protecting Nina's daughter, by protecting Bo! [Bangs table] And that's the reason why you will never get your hands on her ever again. Never. Then we both know how this will end. Nina Adams. I'm Roman S... No, no introductions necessary. It's better if I know nothing. You work in medicine. A scientist. Genetics. So far so good. Many people admire you... Though not all. They think that you only care about your own ideas and that you'll do anything to achieve them. Guilty. Anything else? You didn't come her for a reading. No. I didn't. I've looked a long time for someone like you. You're different, always have been. Always... Felt things, sensed things that others couldn't. You struggle, mostly. In and out of treatment centers, depression. - How do you know... - Like you said. I'm a scientist. I research. My turn. Your gift. How do you do it? I just do. Must be a burden, I imagine. I know why you're different. You have something special about you. A gene. It's the source of your burden. I can make it a blessing. Hey. Wake up, we're almost there. - I had such a good dream. - Yeah? About what? My mom. Thought you never met her. I didn't. All right, we're here. Where's here? The big apple, kid. New York City. Cool. You know what I like about you, kid? You aren't jaded. What's "jaded" mean? It's what I am. I mean, you still see things fresh. Well, there's a lot to see. Maybe if you're gawking at everything. I'm looking. I mean, your head's on a swivel. You're... [Laughs] Like, oh, look at that tall building? Oh, look, that guy's got a nose ring. I don't know why there's so many tall people. I've never been to New York City. Yeah, well, we're not sightseeing, okay? You need to remember that... I'm a fugitive, and you're an Amber alert. You've said that 50 times. Yeah, and you know when I'll stop saying it? When we get here... the address Winter gave me. Why here? I don't know. Winter doesn't tell me anything. All I know is we get here we're safe. Out here with... Cameras and the cops and... God knows what else, we aren't safe, got it? Agent Farrell, traffic cam caught Bo Adams and William Tate at the tollbooth at the Lincoln tunnel approximately two hours ago. But get this. They get to the tollbooth, they don't throw anything in. No coins, nothing. But the gate goes up anyway. So I rewind, expand, and look at this. Right as the thing goes from red to green, look at the kid... thousand-yard stare, then bam. Her eyes roll over and I get three frames of static. Did you put out an apb on the rental? Yep, car found ditched in Chelsea. All right, repump the Amber alert, and get Manhattan to crowdsource our fugitives. What about Martin and garner? Just landed at jfk. All right, let me know when they're in the city. We got 'em trapped on an island, 22.8 square Miles, no mercy this time. [Horn honking] Did you do that? Hey! Don't you know you have to watch your kid? - Oh, you're yelling at me? - Yeah, I'm yelling at you. You almost flattened the kid and you're yelling at me. Try looking at the light, dumbass. Yeah, the light was yellow, dumbass! What is the matter with you? You should watch your daughter. Oh, God, get back in your Bentley, Leona. Tate, we have to go. You're lucky my driver didn't hit her. - Tate, we should go. - Oh, yeah, I'm lucky. You almost kill the kid, but I'm lucky. Seriously, we should go. People are looking. Let's get outta here. [Line trilling] Hello? Why aren't you at the safe house? I think a better question is... Why are we in New York? The plan is to keep Bo away from the government and away from Skouras. It's called hiding in plain sight. Just go to the safe house, Mr. Tate. Right now. That guy isn't the boss of me, you know. Doesn't make the rules, he's not... God. - Is that... - This? Oh. - It's called a wallet. - Did you... lift it? I did indeed. We were down to our last 20. I figured Leona wouldn't need it, so... - You stole it. - Isn't that what I just said? It's not yours. Well, that's what stealing is, yes. Look, let me give you a little advice. You think that lady got all that money by playing fair? You think she got that gold watch and the... Fancy car by playing by the rules? No, she didn't. That's not how the game's played. That's how it should be played. You and her aren't that different. Oh, no, she's a lot different than me. You're both angry. I'm angry that she... Doesn't carry any cash. Serves you right. This is her home. Everything in her life is here, just waiting for her to come back. Her room hasn't been touched. It's exactly as it was the day she left. Winter has you worried that Bo might get sick like Nina. Bo's a candidate to degrade, Roman. You have to admit that. [Sighs] Look, the more she channels... The more likely she is to end up like her mother. No, that will not happen. [Mysterious music] ♪ Sync & corrections by wilson0804 www.Addic7ed.com __ Thank you. Thank you for coming, Dr. Winter. Do you know why I asked for you here? I read the material that you sent, and... Other than that I haven't the slightest idea. [Laughs] You read about Nina Adams? She's quite remarkable. Represents an enormous opportunity. - For your company, or... - For humanity, Dr. Winter. That's why I'm doing this. I don't need money. I've isolated a very rare, very unique gene. It's inherited through the maternal lines. It provides an ability to... move objects, read minds, and... Project the future. I've read your work for DARPA, MIT, the CIA. You're the global authority on the conscious and unconscious mind. Nina needs you, Dr. Winter. She can't control her gift. And if I did... Decide to help her... Right now there are 47 active conflicts around the world. Nina could end them... all of them. Why not peace? Where are we going? You said you wanted me to return the wallet, didn't you? Be a good samaritan? Really? [Laughs] Yeah. I thought I'd follow your advice for once. Excuse me! [Inhales] I found this lady Delkash's wallet, and I wanted to return it. Great. I'll make sure she gets it. Oh, no. Think we were born yesterday? We need to give it to her personally. Personally. Is that a fact? It is. Well, I'm not supposed to let anybody upstairs without permission. [Electricity crackles] [Elevator dings] You two stay right there for a second. Lights were a nice touch. [Elevator dings] What have we here? [Clock ticking] Hello? Anybody home? Sorry to bother you, ma'am. Remember us from this morning? How did you get in my apartment? No, no! I just... I... I found your wallet and I wanted to return it. Me and... My little girl here. I like your house. You want a reward, don't you? I wouldn't turn it down, ma'am. Things are a little tight. No, you're polite. You. Come with me. You stay here. [Mouthing words] We've got them narrowed down to a 20-block radius. Are Martin and garner on the ground? En route to the Upper East Side. [Phone ringing] Garner. Targets last seen 19 minutes ago at the corner of 63rd and park moving north on foot. Coordinate a response. - Copy. - Garner... Try not to blow this one. Wait here. Here. This is all you are going to get. Where's your son? Where's your son? I lost him and my husband. In the fighting in your country? Yes. Why couldn't they come? I came first. They were to follow. They didn't make it. I'm sorry. Watch her more closely. Oh, I will, ma'am. She could be gone. Take care of yourself. Thank you. Why are you looking at me like that? You have a problem. Mind your own business. You stole something from that nice lady. Again! Ha. What's nice about her? She lost someone she loves. Yeah, well, join the club. - You lost someone too? - Yeah. - Who? - You don't know her. Okay, people, listen up. We got 'em isolated in a 40-block radius. We've had two sightings... one here and here. Now I wanna flood this area with every resource we got. I want interface with the NYPD, with air support, with all our tracking intel. This is a realtime situation. These fugitives should be considered armed and dangerous, and Tate will not let down without a fight. Okay, folks? Let's get after them. Hello, Nina. Just describe yourself. __ What do you mean? How do you think about yourself to yourself? That I'm not like anyone else. You feel isolated? Sometimes. No... Family or close friends, a boyfriend? Boyfriend, yeah. Had one, anyway. No more? Well, Dr. Skouras insisted that I end it. Wanted me to commit fully. Now Dr. Skouras can be very, very persuasive. - [Laughs] - After all, he persuaded me. [Laughs] My mom taught me that. That's beautiful. - Was your mom like you? - Mmhmm. - Too much. - How so? Uh, she was very sensitive. Were you guys close? Mm-hmm. When I was younger. What happened? Well, she went to an institution... When I was 15. Wow, that must've been really terrifying for you. It was. I'm still scared. Especially now. Why? Because I'm pregnant. I'm worried for the baby because of me, because of my mom. Hey, Nina... Don't you worry. About anything. I'm gonna help you. [Helicopter flying] Suspects were last seen here, crossing Madison at 101st. That was about 17 minutes ago. Okay, we're gonna put checkpoints on every street and Avenue in a four-block radius. And what, go building by building? - You said it. - You got the manpower? Big chief said I got all I need. All right, let's go tighten the noose. Come on, gentleman! Two-man teams! We need to find this guy! Hey, gimme that! No, it's something special to her. Really? With all that fancy crap she's got shoved in her apartment you think she's gonna miss it? - Her son gave it to her. - Yeah, well, too bad. - This means something. - Hey, look, kid. Everybody gets dealt a joker every now and then. That old lady just got hers. She'll get over it. You're just like her. No, I'm not. This is us. Come on. Hey. Pardon me. Nice. Another suite at the Waldorf. Oh, look, Winter left us a care package. Great. Fake I.D., new passport, a little story about who I am in case I get arrested. But no cash. You must be starving. "Don't worry, I'll bring dinner." Wow. Deluxe. It's not that bad. Why are you doing that? It said "burn after reading." I read... So I'm burning. Okay, they reached the safe house. Good. It's about time. Now we should assume that Skouras knows they're in the city. Hayden, how's the malware to disable the Amber alert progressing? Working on it like I told you. Can you give me a time frame? It's not an exact science. Well, I know that. I'm just asking question. That's all. To which... I gave an answer. Is everything okay with you? No, it's not. When we started this there were ten of us. Now there's six. We all knew that there were going to be risks. We wouldn't have signed on if we knew this was the outcome. No one would have. To protect Bo we have to be willing to make the sacrifices. Are you? No... I'm not. Then go. Richard... Track him. Excuse me, ma'am. I'm a federal agent. Have you seen this person? Tate! Look. I see 'em. [Panting] We gotta get outta here. Let's go! - Wait, no! - What? - That way. - Come on! Check every unit! Second floor. She said second floor. What are you waiting on? Let's go! I hate heights! It's not heights, it's a ladder. Don't yell! We don't have time for me not to yell. I don't like it when you yell. Well, I don't like it when you don't move. You're still yelling. Bo, get down here now! I can't! I can't! You're too angry! Okay. Do me a favor. Just look at me. It's just you and me, together. Both: FBI! William Tate! All right, just one foot and then the other. I'm right below you. So you don't have anything to worry about, all right? Atta girl. That's better. I like it when you're nice. Come on, you're right here. It's just you and me. There we go, come on. All right, let's go! Why can't you be like this all the time? Someone... Forgot to take out the trash. [Sirens blaring] That's an alias legend... fake name, fake backstory. Can you read the name? "Dean Miller." [Phone ringing] What do you want now? - Where are you going? - The safe house ain't safe. I just watched to feds make the place, and now there's six cops out front. And everywhere I go I'm seeing pictures of the girl. I thought you were working on that. I am. We've had some setbacks. Setbacks? My setback is prison. Stay in the wind for an hour? Now can we do that? How the hell should I know? It will take us that long to get to you realistically, Mr. Tate. Hell of a plan you got here, Winter. He's doing his best. Sometimes plans change, Mr. Tate. An hour. Where? - Winter! - 79th Street Boat Basin. - We'll be there. - Where we gonna go for an hour? I don't know. We'll figure it out. We don't have an hour, you guys, we do not have an hour. Okay. 45 minutes till the meet. 45 stinking... - Dammit! - I can't feel my fingers. Why don't the batteries ever last? - Ah! Now he's not answering. - They're headed midtown. - [Grunts] - Why were they going midtown? Mr. Tate will keep her safe, Channing. You should never have gotten him out, Winter. - She needs her father. - Her father's the problem. She's stronger when she's with him. I made a promise. About Tate? To whom? I made a promise. Hope you painted the room pink. Congratulations. She's gonna be like me. Like my mother. - You don't know that. - No, I do. I can feel it. But that'll be a blessing. - No! It isn't. - Nina, Nina! Nina, your baby will have you. Promise me... Promise me that if she's alone ever, if the... if I'm gone, that you'll take care of her... - Come on. - You'll help her. Please. Milton look at me. Please promise me. Tell you mean it. Promise me. I mean it. - I will protect her. - Okay. I promise. Okay. What are you doing? I'm gonna pawn this necklace. Unless you wanna stand out here and freeze to death. You're selling it? Yes, that's what "pawn" means. - Why? - Well, 'cause... I don't know about you, but I'm not having the best day today. Or yesterday, or... Since I got sprung, to be honest. These last three days have been, well... Hell. Prison was a vacation compared to this. And what I really want is some money so I can get outta here and... No offense, stop babysitting. Without some scratch I ain't got nothing. You got me. Yeah, well... I appreciate that. You're not too bad. Okay, we got empire pawn. That's too far. Staley Bros. Pawn downtown, half moon pawn midtown. Wait, say that again? I said Staley Bros. Pawn, and then half moon pawn midtown. "Half moon." There. All right. Half moon it is. Let's go. We are gonna see what this necklace is worth. You all right, Mrs. Delkash? I can't find your necklace anywhere. When I first came here, I bought this place and waited. One day, three days, one week. Relatives called, Shahrad's body had been found. But my son... Nothing. No word. Not a trace. I looked for years. Hired private Detectives, waited. Nothing ever came. Eventually... I couldn't bear it. To hear he was dead. So I stopped looking. So we're asking for public help to catch this very dangerous fugitive and to return a little girl to her family. She won't catch her the way she's doing it. - How's she doing it? - A simple manhunt. They have no idea what Bo can do. How could she? Only you and I and Winter know that. Even if she gets lucky and finds her, she'll never be able to hold onto her. What are you thinking, Roman? Fight fire with fire. Joshua Carpenter. Been with us for... Almost three years. Steady improvement on material manipulation. 59% degree of accuracy on day-of prognostication. I'm gonna be upfront, Joshua. I'm considering you for a field assignment. Does this have to do with Bo? Yeah, it does. Then I'll do whatever I have to. All right, I want you to concentrate, and tell me in detail what it is I'm thinking about. You're thinking about Nina. That's impressive. [Bell dings] [Hip-hop music playing] ♪ How you doing, man? How much... For this? 90. 90? - 100. - 100 bucks, man? That's real gold. Fool's gold. No, no. That's the genuine article right there. I could melt that down and get ten times that much. No, no, my friend. You cannot. This is not gold. This is a stone. This is called "pyrite." Here, take a look. Oh, here... yeah. This isn't my first rodeo, okay? I know how this works, you lowball me, and I give you an actual dollar value and then we meet in the middle somewhere. Can I help you? You and I are a lot alike. And how are you like me?

This color-you see, it's... Changing. Yeah. Oh, ye-under the light. It's... Yes. This belonged to my mother. I'm sorry, honey, I don't know when. Probably late. Have we found the kid yet? No. We haven't, but we will. 'Cause we're the good guys. All right, honey, I gotta go. I love you too. Don't wait up. Bye. - Sasha okay? - She's fine. She just misses her mom. What's going on? You know they're on a 14 to 20 block radius? I got road blocks going up at every Avenue and major cross street. Plus I got 15 more cops on foot. Attaboy, Martin. Let's get after it. Let's go, guys.

It's 40 minutes from the drop. - He will be there. - How can you be so sure? I trust Bo. Just like I trusted her mother. Just... Still the pool of your mind. Flow towards your unconscious. You're not asleep. Nor are you awake. Now... Bring your true, true self forward. You there? [Very soft] Yeah. Good.. Help create, for me, that which makes you most afraid in your life. Yeah.

Got to hand it to you, kid. About what? About the necklace. It all seems like a coincidence, but with you... there are no coincidences. This is it? Yeah, come on. Here to see Mrs. Delkash. Who's calling? Her son. Oh. Don't forget this. [Elevator dings] [Sob-laughing] If I hadn't stolen the wallet... or the necklace. Don't forget you stole the necklace.

That's not necessary! Keep your mouth shut! No talking. I don't understand. Why the hell are you doing this? Why are you doing that to him? Got a call says he's the guy that ripped off the apartment upstairs. Guys, this is just a big misunderstanding. I... Yeah, it always is. - [Whispers] You can do this. - [Laughs]. Yep.

Understandably so. She's never attempted an event of this significance. Now the army has been kind enough to provide us a drone, and cleared the airspace over the city. You can just see it approaching there. A drone? Over Manhattan? A testament of my belief in Ms. Adams. You should know... The drone is armed. I will ask Nina to concentrate. The missile will launch.
