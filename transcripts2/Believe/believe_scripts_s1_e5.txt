 Previously, on Believe... Now you're being executed for two counts of felony murder, and you have nothing to confess? I'm innocent. They said it was just a smash and grab. They framed me! Bo is a very special little girl. Your job is to protect her, keep her safe. That man, Milton Winter, took Bo. He believes wrongly... That the program was inflicting emotional trauma on the girl.

 It's 3:00 A.M. Hello? Hello? Good morning, Ben. - Check your computer. - I'm sorry, what? - The laptop, now. - Who is this? I'm gonna make you famous, Mr. Wooten. Julian Assange and Edward Snowden are going to wish they were you. Go to your laptop. There's a reason you were chosen, Ben. I'm a fan of your blog and your work for the New York Times. You are fearless. You woke me up to tell me that? I have something to show you. Whoa, how'd you get into my system? Does it matter? You should be more concerned with what you're about to see. This little girl may be the most important person alive today. What the hell is this? It's called project orchestra, a government-sanctioned program designed to weaponize individuals with psychic abilities, including this girl. The people behind this program are dangerous and must be exposed. I'll be in touch. Hey, sleepy, we're the next building down, double-time. There's a guy watching us in that window. Well, then get away from there. - It's not a cop. - Yeah, but he can call one. No one knows we're here. Yeah, well, let's not let some rando ruin our otherwise perfect evening. I know what sarcasm is. Great, that's one less vocabulary word we'll have to study in the morning. Jeez, kid, you're out like a light. Hey, it's me. Not good. I keep reading in the papers about how I'm a murderer. Yeah, well, someday the truth's gonna come out, and then there's gonna be hell to pay.

My stomach's growling. Tate? What, you're banging on the door - like you're the "po-lice." - Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Just giving myself a little trim. You could use one yourself, shaggy. Caveman. Tate, I'm starving. Yeah, I heard you the first time. We need more food, you know? Well, I'd get more food if we had cash for more food, but we don't. Then we need money. Yeah, we need money from Winter. And for him to tell us what we're doing here. Winter doesn't know. I know. So if you know, explain it to me. Why? It's just we wouldn't be here if we weren't supposed to be here. Which means you don't know. Get your feet off the couch. What are you doing? You have scars. Yeah, I know. Don't. This is actually pretty good. Who's the girl? I don't know her name yet, - but she needs help. - Yeah. That's a thing with you. Stay put. Get me a drink from the machine? Drink water. It's organic. A guy calls in the middle of the night, and that's a big story? You do realize how insane you sound? Yeah, I do, and I'm saying it anyways. This is legitimate and compelling, Jill. And a huge get for The Times. All right, you know what I'm gonna say, right? You can publish whatever you want on your blog, but... - get confirmation. - On the record this time. That's the plan, yeah. Warm up my Pulitzer, Jilly. Don't scare me like that. You're so jumpy today. Well, you would be too if you read all this stuff. What stuff? A latent gene for telekinesis. Is that what you're blogging about? I know, I know. This is not some crackpot conspiracy theory. There's documentation, there's research. I mean, it just feels real. Go with me on this, please. Ben, there's something... Just don't do anything stupid, okay? - Hi. - Roman Skouras. Thank you. You have a problem. Nice to see you too, Director Lofton. There's a leak. That's highly unlikely. Unsubstantiated information is surfacing on the Internet, Roman. Some blogger is posting about a government program, codenamed "Orchestra." We vetted our side. There are only four possibilities in the administration. It's not us. I'll handle it. Did they mention my name? Mr. Zepeda... Plug the leak. Hello? It's me. - What the hell are you doing? - Where's Bo? - She's back in the apartment. - You left her? Tate, that's the one thing you're not supposed to do. I'll be in the car. Whatever. Did you bring money? - Who were you calling? - People I have business with. Oh, right, your friends who set you up for murder, right. Yeah. Your vengeance is gonna have to wait, Mr. Tate. - I could leave right now. - Leave. - Then what? - Hey, look, I'm not a damn babysitter, all right, Winter? I was locked up for seven years, man. I was this close to being put down. I want to leave. And go where, back to death row? I can return you just as easily as I freed you, if that's what you want. Is that what you want? And what about Bo? You've grown fond of her. She needs you, Mr. Tate. Shall we? Taryn, hold up. Taryn! I can't deal with this again, Ben, not now. - This is totally different. - How? You're already getting threats on your blog. The phone hasn't stopped ringing. Taryn, our government is creating supernatural soldiers. You have no proof this isn't some elaborate hoax. It's not a hoax, babe. Don't you care about our reputation, and what it will do to us? I care about putting the truth out there. What happened to "trust but verify"? I am gonna verify. He said he'd be in touch. Listen, just let me do my job. I can't focus on anything else right now, please. I swear to God, Taryn, I cannot. I think it's broken. Of course it is. Super. Hi. You shouldn't have soda anyway. And why's that? It's bad for the baby. I just took the test yesterday. How do you know that? You have a glow? What's your name? Bo. I need this to be a secret for a little while, okay, Bo? A secret from who? - Where are your parents? - I don't know. Here, have mine. No caffeine, that's semi-okay. Thanks. What Joshua did to Mr. Gore, it's lucky his brain still functions at all. Clear and irreversible damage to the amygdala and the hippocampus. Both regions crucial to memory. Exactly. Joshua has unexpectedly developed the ability to target and destroy memory cells. What are you thinking, Roman? Joshua's getting stronger. That gives me options. Ben Wooten. Are you ready, Mr. Wooten? My interest is piqued, but if you want The Times to run this story, I'm gonna need... You'll need proof. I'm ready to deliver it. Yeah, well, I'm getting pushback on my blog post. I'm gonna need more than proof. I'm gonna need you, on the record. I can give you that. This one's my favorite. Oh, yeah. Oh, these are beautiful, Bo. - Thank you. - You have a gift. It's, like, amazing how you see. Who's the girl? She's not clear yet. I think she's a grown-up, though. I like this one with the car too. Is she your mom? I don't know. It could be, I'm not sure. Well, she must have been really lovely to have a daughter like you. She was. I think she was. She passed away? Yeah, she died. But I still feel her. I feel like moms and daughters are always connected. But I'm sorry she passed away. Why won't you tell Ben about your daughter? Well, that is kind of hard to understand. See, we're going through a hard time. Right now we don't have a lot to offer a baby. You have everything to offer. I have to pee. Hey, Bo. How do you know it's a girl? Bo? Who are you? Hi. I'm Taryn. I'm your neighbor. - Where's Bo? - The bathroom. Are you her dad? - Yeah. - I found her out back by the soda machine. I thought I'd wait until you got back. - I appreciate that. - No problem. She's a pistol. She's always running off. Are you okay? Yeah, never better. I promise, I double and triple-checked. So what you're telling me is, it's the same address. This blogger lives right here. Apartment 4D. It's not a coincidence. No, can't be. Keep working. How is Wooten getting his information? My question exactly. Well, if we know Wooten's here, Skouras does too. We're leaving. Go get Bo's things. I'll secure the next location. Winter, it's not ready yet. I still haven't... I will make it ready. Miss Channing, you know what the stakes are. - Yeah. - Do what I ask you to do. Okay. - Pack up, we're leaving. - We're eating. Tate, this place is about to be compromised. Please. Let's go. Bo, grab your things. - We have to help her. - Who, sweetie? Taryn. I think she's gonna be just fine. No, we have to help her now! - Bo. - We have to go. Whoa, hey, hey, easy. No! I have to go! I have to help Taryn! - Okay, just calm down. - No! All right, this is it, babe. He's gonna give me everything. I'll have my cell phone. Wait for my call. Tea? - What's going on? - Who are you? I'm a friend of a friend. Well... Hey! Now, I'm new to your blog, but I love it. Vivid. I'm wondering where all that fine detail comes from. Somebody's leaking information to you, and they need to stop. So... You're gonna give me your source. Hurry up! I know where their apartment is. Come on. Hey, ho, ho, ho. Hold on a second. I'll be right back. - Stay here. - Seriously? Hey, how are ya? Where do they live? Stay with Bo. I won't divulge. - You won't divulge your source? - No. But you're a blogger. You're a fake journalist. - I can't. - Right. Journalistic integrity. Who's more important, your source or your wife? There are too many, Tate. Channing needs help. Stay. Hold her still. Drop it. Drop it! - Where are Taryn and Ben? - They went out back. We'll meet them round the corner. - Get in the back. - Okay. - We're calling the police! - No, no, no! No cops! No cops. Get in the car, go! We have to get off the street. We've got to get to Winter. Get in! So "no guns" is more of a guideline. Did I fire the weapon? No. God! I could've taken that guy. I'm sure you'll get your shot. Everyone okay back there? Bo? Yeah. Who are you people? What the hell have you landed us in now, Winter? I think Ben can answer that question better than I. Wait, what? I don't... no. I don't know what's going on. You're writing about Project Orchestra. I need to know where that intel came from. Why don't you tell me who you are first? The man who came to you this afternoon meant to kill both of you. You process that. We are here to help you, Ben. We can protect you. Why? Why would you do that? Ben, just trust him, please. I can't do that. I don't even know who the source is. - I have to tell this story. - We wouldn't have lived to tell this story. You have to stop. - I can't. - Ben, please. She's gonna have a baby. Sorry. Taryn, wait. - Wooten had help. - What do you mean? Asian woman, trained, a fighter, and a Caucasian male, shaved head, built. - Did you see a child? - Glimpsed as they fled, why? Listen carefully, Mr. Zepeda. Find Ben Wooten. When you do, do not approach. Wait for my instructions, understood? Why? Why should I wait? I have an ace up my sleeve. Sir? Let Joshua know I have a job for him. Yes, Mr. Skouras. How, um... how far along are you? Six weeks maybe. I don't know. I haven't been to the doctor. What does it matter? You've a choice to make, Ben. Make it now. You don't know how important this is. I wish you could understand what this means. Tell me what it means. They wouldn't be after us if this wasn't real. This is my chance to tell a story that really matters. I love you, Ben. Do you love me? Of course, I do. I just... I want to do the right thing. Ben and Taryn, we have to help them. Last thing I'm thinking about right now is Ben and Taryn. They're why we're here, though. No, a wanted poster is why I'm here. But they're gonna join forces, and they'll write stories together that change people's lives. Well, he can do that alone. He can, but he won't. Some people can't be apart. They don't work. Like you. I work. I work fine. No, you don't. You lost someone, remember? That's why you're so angry all the time. - That's not why. - Then why? Because you piss me off. I'm not angry, I... you know, I hate to break it to you, Bo, but we're not here to help Ben and Taryn. Angry. Ben's gone. - What? - He left. We have to go after Ben, Winter. - Jill, it's Wooten. - Hi, Ben. I'm hammered with a deadline, so this better be good. - They tried to kill us. - What? Who tried to kill you? Did... did you go to the police? Listen, Jill, this is real, and it is huge, like front page, above-the-fold huge. What about your source? I'm on my way to meet him right now. He's gonna give me everything, Jill, he's coming in. All right, Ben. Good work. Look, try not to get you and Taryn killed before you deliver. Yeah, you're a sweetheart. Did you put Joshua in the field without telling me? Did you put Joshua in the field? - You want Bo back? - Of course. I thought Zepeda was handling this. It's an exercise, Zoe. We have a leak. You saw what Joshua did to Mr. Gore. Aren't you worried about what might happen to Bo? Yes! It's necessary, Zoe. What are we doing here, Roman? If it goes sideways, Zepeda's there to pick up the pieces. So you're gonna do this? With Bo there? Yes. My God, Roman. You know you're wrong. Your husband had the right idea. Abandon his pregnant wife? Run. Find higher ground. You have money on you? No. Everything's at the apartment. All right, then let's go. I'm not going anywhere with you. No? You wanna stick around? You feel safe here? There's no safe place right now. Well, think of one. Out of town, out of state. I'll get you to it. Look, the folks who came at you, they're not going away. And the people we're here with right now, they want to move us towards those people. Why can't we go to the police? Because they won't let you. You think I'm here by choice? You want to wait until they slap one of these on you? What about your daughter? She's not my daughter. She belongs to them. Come on. I wanna get Stanley, my turtle. Forget about Stanley. He's in the apartment. You're going there. - No, we're not. - Yes, you are. - God, Bo, stay. - I'm not a dog. Stay with Winter. I'll be right back. - We need to find Ben. - He's gone, Bo. He left. Not forever. He's not gone forever. I'm sure that's true, okay? Just, Bo, let me take care of one thing at a time. Bring Stanley. I need him. Tate. The keys are under the seat. Oh, she a miracle worker? Hey! She's something. Yes? My sources at the New York Times tell me they're holding the late edition. They won't have anything to print, Director. I will hold you to your word. Unbelievable. Our buddy Tate decided to make a pit stop. Went back to the apartment? You think Skouras didn't leave someone there? We have to go. This way, come on, come on. - Okay. - I'm gonna kill him. Kill him! All right, grab your purse. And anything else you think you might need. Looks like no one followed us. So if you're not Bo's father, then why are you traveling with her? Long story. She may not be your daughter, but you still care about her. I can tell. I barely know her. You feel the same way I do. She calms. She's like a perfect, even chord. Yeah, nails down a chalkboard. Get your crap, please. I don't believe you. About what? The whole "nails down a chalkboard" act. I saw your face when you said good-bye to Bo. Bo is special, Tate. She's just a kid. Don't pretend like you don't know. She knew I was pregnant. She knew where the car key was. Did she warn you about those guys that attacked us? Yeah. Can you pack your stuff, please? What are you running from? Most people spend their whole lives looking for a connection like that. It's just voodoo. It doesn't mean anything. Really? You really believe that it doesn't mean anything? I'd want my child to know that people like Bo are possible. That anything is possible. Yeah, well, she doesn't need me. She's got Winter and Channing and whoever the hell else helping them out, - and it's... it's... - Well, she didn't ask them to bring her turtle, Stanley, back. She asked you. Are we doing the right thing here? You know where Ben is? Yes, and he's at risk out in the open. We can't run. Yeah, I got 'em. Tate's left the apartment. On the move, headed east. My asset should be arriving momentarily. Yeah, they're rolling up now. Listen, let me take Wooten. Do not interfere, Mr. Zepeda. Let Joshua do his job. He will deliver the leak. You think you could run? You think we couldn't catch you? We're not running. We're helping Ben. Train station. This is a train station. - Yeah, I know. - We're looking for Ben. He always comes here to meet his contacts. He likes the crowds and the white noise, so he can hide in plain sight. There. It's Ben. Taryn, what are you doing here? You have to come with us. Please. So... Can you find him? No doubt. Just give me some space. It is not safe here. You gotta go. I put you in danger, and I'm trying to fix it, all right? Please let me. Okay, but you need to calm down, because we can run, we can go. No, we'll be running forever, okay? I'm meeting my source right now. He has hard evidence that the government has programs like Orchestra. Once I tell this story, once I put it out there, then we are safe, our baby's safe. There's no need to hurt us. People need to know this. They have to. This story does need to be told. But not yet. Everything that you've been looking for, every single thing this source has promised you is right here. Bo is your story. You can't leave. I can. I have to make this right. You can't. Not without Taryn. Not apart. You're supposed to be together. Once orchestra's exposed, Taryn will be safe. But it's the wrong story. What do you mean? There's a better one coming. A bigger story. And you're gonna tell it. Both of you. You're with Taryn when the baby's born. You're with her then. She has to be with you now. If you're apart, the baby doesn't come. Because Taryn gets hurt. What's going on? - Ooh. Oh, wow. - Are you okay? - What's happening? - What the hell is this? - Something's in my head. - Where? Open your eyes, open your eyes. Something's happening in my head. - They're here. - Who's here? Orchestra. Okay, now come... come... okay, okay. Everybody walk to the lobby. We've got to get him outta here. Do not stop. Come on, let's go. - Taryn... - Come on, Bo. Dr. Skouras, we've accessed the train station security camera. There's my girl. What's happening to him? They're looking for the source. Keep going. You're gonna make it. Oh, God. Oh, my God. What's happening to him? Help us! - Help us! Help us! - What do we do? Winter, what do we do? Get him up on his feet. Help us, please. I got him. Get him on his feet. Get him on his feet. Baby. Come on, move, Taryn. We've gotta get him up. We've gotta get him up. Come on. Stop! Stop it! Stop it! Leave Ben alone! Stop! Stop it! She's getting stronger. What you saw can't be reported. The world's not ready. Bo is not ready. You understand? I understand. If she's taken by these men, they'll abuse and exploit her gifts, and no one is safe. What about, us? Are we safe? Do we have to run? No. I can make sure they know it's a dead end. I have contacts. I will make sure you're both safe. Move on with your lives. Have your baby. Raise your family and wait. When this little girl is ready, she will find you. Then you're gonna write a story that changes the world. Bo. Thank you. You saved us. It's time for bed, Bo. Are you gonna tuck me in? Of course. Let me just get this. I couldn't help what happened. That wasn't your fault. That was them. They did something bad to Ben. Yes, they did. And you stopped it. You protected Ben and Taryn. But someone got hurt. I did it. I hurt someone. But it wasn't your fault. He was bleeding. I did it. Did he die? You don't kill people, Bo. You don't kill people. Now when you're stronger and you can control this gift that you have... I don't want to control it. I don't want to use it. If I don't use it, I'll never hurt anyone. I just don't want it anymore. How's Joshua? It's too early to say. Are you all right? Of course. And you? Yes and no. I'm frustrated we don't have her. But thrilled by her strength. She's everything we hoped she would be. But... It's easy enough to suppress this footage, coordinate a cover story, get out in front of it. But we still have a leak. And that angers me. I abhor being lied to. Who doesn't? When I find the traitor, I'll make them beg for mercy, but I will not grant it. You awake? Yeah. You should sleep. My brain's moving too fast. Yeah. Yeah, I know that feeling. I wasn't coming back, Bo. When Taryn and I left, I wasn't coming back. You were coming back. I wasn't, Bo. I lied. You just thought you were lying. Tate? Yeah. Are you scared of me now? No. You're just a kid, no. Yes, you are. It's okay. Everyone gets scared eventually. I know you have to leave. So you can go now. Sync & corrections by wilson0804 web dl sync snarry
