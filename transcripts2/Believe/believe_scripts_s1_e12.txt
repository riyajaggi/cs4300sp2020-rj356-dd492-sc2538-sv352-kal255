 Previously on Believe... - Bo, who is that? - Dani. Her readings are the strongest we've seen since Bo. She's had a difficult past, Roman. Most of our subjects here have. Most of our subjects didn't kill their brother. This heavy bookcase at our house, it fell on top of him. Dr. Winter did a good job with you, didn't he? Taught you to meditate to prevent anyone from getting inside that mind of yours.

 I don't care who she is. You may feel differently soon. Look out! [Gunshot] You won't survive if we don't get you to a hospital. Then find me one somewhere off the grid. Winter was responsible for your mother's death. Is it true? My mom died because of you? I will share the blame for that terrible, terrible decision. I'm not going with you. I'm going with my dad.

 As you know, the degrade is like a cancer. The onset in Dani is remarkably aggressive. You're afraid of seeing everything you've built collapse. You're afraid of something happening to the little girl. Milton, it's Roman. I need your help. Well, it's not the four seasons. For some of us, Roman, luxury is not an option. Yeah, well, I didn't come here to debate philosophy. What do you need, Roman? I'm an open book, Milton. I came alone. I'm unarmed. I'm at your mercy. What circumstance could be so dire that you would risk walking in here and asking for help from somebody you tried to kill? Her name is Dani, Dani Sullivan. I believe she means to kill Bo. [Airy, mysterious music] ♪ Sync & corrections by wilson0804 www.Addic7ed.com [Rock music blares] Turn it down! Stop it. [Chuckling] Where are we? We are just outside of the city on the highway of life, kid, headed south to greener pastures. How south? Well, we're almost out of New Jersey, and once we get some fuel, hit the road, next stop... [Whispers] Ixtapa. Ix-what-a? [Whispers] Ixtapa. That's how you got to say it. [Whispers] Ixtapa. [Giggles] It's a little beach town in old Mexico. My Uncle Donny took me there once when I was a kid. I've always dreamed about going back there. To be honest, it's kind of what got me through being locked up. Figure it's a great place to start over. We have nothing to start with. Come on, kid, you think I don't have a plan? The lottery? You go do your thing, get us the winning lottery ticket, and then we'd have more than enough to start over, and you wouldn't have to do one of your little spookie things ever again. We'd be left alone forever, and it'd just be you, me... and Stanley. Stanley, a palapa, and some cold beer. No mas problemas, señorita. [Both laughing] All right, go in there and buy whatever junk food you want to get. I got to get some gas. This girl? Dani? Tell me about her. She's 19, a runaway, estranged from her family. She's untrained, undisciplined, and very, very gifted. How gifted? Right now, I wouldn't bet on Bo. Dani's anguish has made her very powerful, but she's suffering from the degrade, the most rapid onset I've ever seen. She's gonna die soon, and she knows it. She blames me for her condition. So she wants to kill Bo to make you suffer. She knows I care about Bo. That's what this is about. She wants Bo, orchestra, me. She wants to destroy the very idea of orchestra. She wants to eliminate any possibility that a person like her or Bo could ever... Be exploited again. All right, Milton, whatever has happened between us, I am begging you, set it aside, please. I will do anything. I have exhausted my resources. Milton, I need your help now. We've got to protect Bo. - That could prove difficult. - Why? Two days ago, you told Bo how her mother died, said that I shared in the blame. You left her only one choice, Roman, and it wasn't me, and it sure as hell wasn't you. What are you saying? I'm saying she chose her father, and I don't know where they are. Ask her about the dove. Mom, what are you doing here? Ask her about the dove. Who am I asking? Mom? I like your bracelet, especially the dove. Oh, this? Thanks. My best friend gave it to me. It was hers. That's nice. Are you still close? She kind of had some real rough things happen to her, so... I'm sorry. Yeah. Do you mind if I look at it? Yeah. Knock yourself out. What are you writing about? None of your business. John! Hey, stop. [Rattling] [Screams] Oh, my God! John! You all right? I'm not used to more than a few seconds of silence with you. I just saw something, something I was meant to see. You were having one of your little moments. I could see it in your face. I can't just stop them. Hey, look at me. I know you can't, and I don't expect you to. Did you see something you wanted to talk about? I don't think so. What I saw was pretty confusing. Yeah, well, we could sit around here and try to figure it out, but we got a date South of the border, so what do you say we just, I don't know, let those little moments go? Think you could do that? It's not just a coincidence. No, and I'm sure it's not, believe me. I just... I got to move on. I can't keep going on like we've been going, you know? So do you think maybe you could please just pretend it didn't happen, for me? Sure, I'll try. That's my girl. [Sobbing] I'm sorry, John. Maybe someday you can forgive me. Are you insane, Winter? Give me one reason I don't strangle him with my bare hands. Look, until we can neutralize this threat, we've got to work together. - Someone, please, wake me. - We have a plan. Dani has no way of finding Bo, not directly, so she'll start using the information she does have, information she read from you. What's that supposed to mean? Milton discovered years ago that when a subject makes a telepathic connection... you mean messes with someone's head. Yes, that subject retains an imprint. It's like an echo of the target's consciousness. It means that Dani can find you. So you want to use me as live bait? I need you to let me hypnotize you. So are we staying here tonight? Negatory. We're just staying long enough to grab a shower and get cleaned up. [Phone rings] Who is it? It's the chief baby-sitter. He's been calling nonstop. The inbox for this voicemail is full. Nothing. So why do you think this girl Dani is stronger than Bo? Because she's driven by hate, Miss Channing. These extraordinary abilities are intimately connected to emotions. The stronger the emotions, the stronger the power. Dani's convinced she's been betrayed by the world, forsaken by her parents, lied to by me, dying because of her gift. We found her too late. She needed orchestra. Bo was nurtured there, loved. Dani never had that, and she hates me for it, hates orchestra... Hates Bo. Sir, Mr. Zepeda for you. What's the update? Coming together as discussed. Have your people checked in? Everything's on schedule. She'll never see it coming. No, I think you're gonna dig it. It's got miles of white Sandy beaches, the locals down there are chill, and the best part is, nobody down there's gonna be looking for us. So we can get you enrolled in an actual school. Shh, I'm trying to hear the TV. We interrupt this program to bring you breaking news. There was a fire in Brooklyn earlier this morning. The blaze started several hours ago, and was reported by a group of kids using the abandoned parking structure across the street. Dani did this. Dani? The girl I saw at the gas station. Okay, so you saw a girl in your vision at the gas station, and you're saying that she's responsible? Tate, look. Don't you recognize that building? It's Winter's loft. And we're being told that full knockdown is expected shortly. What? No. According to fire department sources, these buildings are unoccupied, though some are host to... I knew it. What? There's something else. I saw mom. She warned me about this girl Dani. Has that ever happened before, you seeing your mom? No, never. Why didn't you tell me that in the first place? Because I knew how excited you were to go to Mexico. I don't think Mexico's in the cards anymore, not if you're seeing your mom. I'm sorry. Don't. There's nothing to be sorry for. So this girl Dani, we need to find her. Yeah, but how are we supposed to do that? We don't have any idea where she is, or... you're seeing this, right? Yeah. Good, just checking. Get your stuff. ♪ Borders and horizon lines ♪ ♪ we're alone but side by side ♪ ♪ half awake and almost dead ♪ ♪ keeping empty beds elsewhere ♪ ♪ we're yet to bleed ♪ ♪ we're yet to bleed ♪ ♪ all the time and energy ♪ ♪ we're yet to bleed ♪ ♪ we're yet to bleed ♪ ♪ all the time and energy ♪ Just relax, Miss Channing. This technique is very well established, and it will work. If this girl is as strong as Skouras says, she will hear this signal, and she'll be drawn to it. Close your eyes. Breathe in very slowly. More slowly. Open your mind to your past. Breathe out. Slowly, evenly. You feel yourself becoming lighter. Every cell in your body is floating, weightless. Your body isn't your body anymore, only a thought, only a consciousness. Let her find you, Miss Channing. Let yourself radiate a beacon of bright light. Let Dani find you. [Breathing heavily] Now, Mr. Zepeda. This isn't right. She should be unconscious by now. Is she neutralizing the gas? No, that's impossible. Roman, you should know by now, nothing is impossible. Go, Mr. Zepeda. Go, now. [Gunfire] Mr. Zepeda. Damn it. Wait. Wait! [Groans] No. Dani, stop. Dani, stop hurting her. Enough, Dani, enough! Enough. Winter. Yes. Tell me where Bo is. - I don't know. - Yes, you do. Tell me! I don't know. Don't try and resist. Dani, please. [Gasping for breath] This... this knows where they are. You tracked their phone. I'll make sure Bo knows you're the reason I found her. Looks like this is the place. Routledge house, a therapeutic home for girls. So I'll pick you up next Tuesday? I'm playing. Doesn't look like anyone lives here anyways. [Knocks on door] Well, there's only one way to find out. Come on. This is her, the girl. Well, at least we know we're in the right place. Yeah, now we just have to figure out why. What is that, writing? What does it say? "Forgive me, John. "Forgive me, John. Forgive me, John." Over and over. All she wants is for her brother to forgive her. That's all she cares about. Yeah, but isn't that proof that she did it, that she killed him? I mean, you don't ask for forgiveness for something you didn't do. She needs a second chance. Yeah, well, I hate to break it to you, Bo, but some people just aren't worth saving. They're just too far gone. It's not worth the time or the energy to try and salvage them. You know they could've said that about you when you were in prison. The only difference is that you got a second chance. She was good once. I can feel it. That sounds familiar. Yeah, that's what I said about you when we first met. Kind of changed your whole life around, didn't I? Oh, is that so? Pretty much. Listen, Bo, I hear you, really, but there's one big difference between me and this Dani chick. What's that? I never actually killed anyone. She did. You really think someone like that can be saved? I don't want to be saved. All right, I think that's close enough. Tate! Tate. Wake up, Tate! Don't try and stop me, little girl. You're not strong enough. There's nothing you can do. I'm gonna take you to Dr. Skouras, and I'm gonna show him that you're not worth his love. Please, you don't have to do this. I know you didn't mean to kill your brother. [Screams] Come on! Go! Bo? Bo! - Zepeda? - Yes, sir. - I assume he's... - Dead. Who found him? Anonymous tip. Director Lofton. Roman, look familiar? Found with the body. Who else has seen these? No one outside the agency, but I want you to know, Roman, if these documents go public, the agency will deny any and all involvement. You'd be completely on your own, you understand? Don't worry, sir. We can handle this. Don't let this rattle you. I'm going back to orchestra. We have to erase everything, every trace before the story breaks. Sir, what we should really... you see what Dani's doing, don't you? She wants everything out in the open. She could send the originals to the times, the guardian, hundreds of outlets. I want a complete evacuation, subjects, staff, security. Every person at orchestra, I want gone. Of course, sir. There is no story if orchestra doesn't exist. I didn't know what else to do. No, you did the right thing, Mr. Tate. - Did I, Winter? - You did. Nobody is alone in this world, do you understand? You're not alone. Neither is Bo, ever. She's alone right now, Winter, somewhere. If that Dani girl hurts her... that is not going to happen. How do you know that? 'Cause I think I know where Dani took her. Come on. Wait. We want the same thing, you know. No, we don't. To be normal, ordinary. I missed that boat the day I was born and every day since. Everything's been taken from me... my parents, my brother, my chance to fit in. Skouras promised me that, then he took it away. I want him to see what it feels like to have everything he cares about destroyed... his company, his program... You. This is the last of it, sir. Sir? Yes, that's fine. Thank you, Cory. Make certain it's all shredded, then get yourself out of here. Yes, sir. What's the rush? There's nothing left, Dani. All the files, all the records, all the data. You got what you wanted. Orchestra is no more. Not all of it. I'm still here, Dr. Skouras. You're still here. Yeah. And Bo... Your favorite. It's over, Dani. It's finished. All of this... records, files... it's just stuff. This. This is real. Bo! Tate! I'm sorry, kiddo, we're here. Hey, Bo. Roman, where's Dani? Waiting for you. All of us together at last. We're gonna experience the end of orchestra. Isn't that what you wished for, Winter? Not this way, Dani. Nobody needs to die to see orchestra finished. What's happening? It won't open. Milton, please, please will you untie me? Bo, sweetheart, can you do anything? Whoa, hey, hey. Whoa, I got you. It's all right. - I can't do it. - No, it's okay. It's all right. It's all right. It's all right, baby. Come on. Hope you're proud of yourself. It's not gonna help, Mr. Tate. It's not gonna help. You already dug us too deep in a hole, huh? Dani's more powerful. I wonder whose fault that is? I love you, Bo. I love you too. I'm sorry we couldn't be together all this time. I know. Mom, I don't know what to do. You can save everybody. You can save Dani. How? Dani needs to know that her brother forgives her, that he doesn't blame her for what happened, and that he loves her. Will you tell her that? That's my girl. Mom. Why can't you stay with me? I'll never be far. And you have your dad now. Now it's time to be strong. What'd your mom tell you? To save Dani. If she said you have to save her, then that's what you have to do. This is who you are, Bo, and I get it, and I got your back 100%. I love you. I love you too. Dani, stop it! You can't do this! Please! You don't need to do this! Bo, Bo, Bo. No, no. No, Winter, no. There's nothing we can do. None of us can. You've got to trust Bo. Dani, listen to me. I have a message for you, from your brother, from John. He forgives you, and he loves you. How could you know that? My mom told me. Your mom told you? - Please, Dani. - No! Listen to him. It's true. I told you. John loves you, and he forgives you. Now you can stop fighting. Thank you. Everyone deserves a second chance. What happened? What'd you tell her? I didn't tell her anything. She talked to her brother. Bo. Bo, you have to go. Are you coming with us? No. You go with your dad. You don't need me anymore. Thank you, Milton. That's my girl. Go. You got to go. You got to go. Go. [Sirens approaching] Roman. Milton, please, just go. [Slams door] [Gasps] [Sighs] Were you dreaming? I don't think so. No visions, no premonitions? You're not seeing anybody that might need our help, nothing like that? Just sleeping. All right, just checking. You know, you never held up your end of the bargain. What are you talking about? The lottery, I totally forgot. Guess it's not too late. Just messing with you. Thought I'd do it the old-fashioned way, be normal. I like that idea. Yeah, me too. See, we're getting more normal by the minute. Mm-hmm. Sync & corrections by wilson0804 www.Addic7ed.com
