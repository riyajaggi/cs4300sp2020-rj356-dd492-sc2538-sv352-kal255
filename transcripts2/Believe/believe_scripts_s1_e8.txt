 Previously, on Believe... Bo is a very special little girl, but she can't control her gifts. How they manifest is completely unpredictable. Bo Adams must be located and recovered. I don't care about William Tate, only Bo, and I intend to use every resource at my command to recover her. Your telekinetic event sensor is now fully operational. We are now able to track any telekinetic activity within moments of the event.

 We can find Bo. You should never have gotten him out, Winter. - She needs her father. - Her father's the problem. She stronger when she's with him. She's your daughter, Mr. Tate. It was Nina, right? - Bo's mom? - Yes. - Was she like Bo? - No one is like Bo. So what happened? Nina died in childbirth. You're my dad, aren't you? Attagirl, Bo. Just concentrate. All right, now, change the shape. Good.

 Good. How about a pyramid? All right, come on, Bo, come on. Just focus. You can do this. You can do this! I'm trying. Come on, Bo, you can do this, come on. Hey, take it easy, will you? Hey, look, I just need to increase her ability to do what she's doing, that's all. Yeah, she's been at it all day. Bo, who is that? Try again. Let's try again. No, let's not. Bo, go bug Channing for a little bit, watch some TV, eat some junk food. You're done for the day. It's okay, sweetheart. - You need to let her be a kid. - We don't have that luxury. We have to be proactive. Not really your choice, though, is it? See, now, I'm her father. Your daughter needs more control. If she can't master this beautiful ability that she has... she'll what, have an actual life? She won't be able to take on Orchestra. Do you understand? Oh. Okay, so that's the plan, huh? We're just gonna confront 'em? It is, actually. She almost died a few days ago. She was in a coma. Do you remember that? - Yes, I remember that. - Then she needs a breather, some time to actually be normal. She's not normal... And she never will be. Sync & corrections by wilson0804 www.Addic7ed.com I got your message. Are the machines fully operational? It's 100% accurate. We can identify and locate any telekinetic event and the person it came from. Every subject's signal is unique... like a fingerprint, I know. It's Bo, Roman. It's definitely Bo's signal. Point of origin? North Philadelphia. We have it triangulated to a one-block radius. Krakauer been mobilized? I... per your orders, yes. How Krakauer accomplishes his objective is not your concern, Zoe. Things are different between me and Tate now that we both know. I think he just needs some time, time to get his head around things. But at least he's trying. Why didn't you tell me sooner? Winter wanted Tate to get to know you first, so he'd be comfortable. Then he'd want to stay. They found us. They found us. There's two more coming this way. To the roof. Come on, let's go. Let's go! The roof! Go, go. Quickly! - You sure that thing's safe? - No, Mr. Tate, I'm not. But we have no choice. Come on. Come on! I'll take you. Come on! - Did you do that? - Uhhuh. - Nice job, kid. - Come on, you guys! - Let's go! - Thanks. The telekinetic event sensor is fully operational, isn't it? You tracked Bo. Just a yes or no, Zoe. Milton, you can't keep running. I was there when it was developed, Zoe, remember? And I know that Orchestra has the means to locate a telekinetic event. I know this. And now, you've found a way to use it at a distance outside of Orchestra. Yes or no, Zoe? I'm not gonna answer that. You just did. Any clue how they found us? Unfortunately, yes. Bo. Come and see me. Ahh! You're not leaving already, are you? We have to, sweetheart. Miss Channing and I have some things we need to take care of. But before I go, I need to talk to you, okay? - Okay. - Come here. Oh! Bo, do not use your ability, no matter how much you're tempted. If you do, those people will find you. Do you understand? You understand, Mr. Tate? Yeah, got it. Be careful, Channing. Of course I will, sweetie. Don't worry. We'll be fine. Well, Mr. Tate, you wanted to be normal... Just a regular father and daughter? Yeah. You give it your best shot right now. Ferrell. I have some information you might find relevant. - William Tate is alive. - No fault of yours, I assume? I don't wish the man dead, Agent Ferrell. I've heard nothing through official channels, so... you will soon. Just wanted to give you a heads-up, in the spirit of cooperation, of course. You want to tell me how this hot tip came to you, doctor? - Not especially. - Right, I didn't think so. Good day, Dr. Skouras. - Home sweet home, huh? - Tell me a bedtime story. - Seriously? - Yeah, seriously. - Like... like, kid-friendly? - Yes, kid-friendly. What about how you met mom? Um, well... I was a lot younger and, if you can believe it, a lot dumber than I am now. And I'd come down to Milford for a job. To rob someone. You gonna let me tell the story? Came down to Milford, and I'm waiting for a buddy of mine, and all of a sudden, it just starts pouring rain. And I look up, and I see this sign, and it says, "psychic advisor." And so I figure I can duck in there and wait out the storm. And so I go inside, and there was this girl. Woman. This beautiful woman, Nina. Hello? Story. So I don't have anywhere to be right away, so she starts giving me this reading. So she takes my palms like this, and she starts telling me things about myself, like where I was from and who I was, and... Then she tells me I'm gonna meet the love of my life, my soul mate, "the one and only girl for me." That's how she said it. She knew right at that first moment about me and her. And that was it. I fell for her. I guess she fell for me, even though she knew all about me. Maybe because she knew all about you. I don't know. So? Uh, what happened then's not so kid-friendly. - What? - Go to bed. Only if you promise to tell the rest. Deal. Get some shut-eye, all right? Continue your search. They didn't just disappear. - Understood. - Thank you, Mr. Krakauer. Keep me informed. - Trail's gone cold. - I'm sorry. Don't be. The machine has Bo's telekinetic signature. Next time she channels something significant, - we'll catch it. - Mmhmm. Don't you think? I hope. I built a chip which can stop Orchestra from tracking Bo's signal. So how does it work? It's like a phone scrambler. Bo does something big enough, uses her powers, that machine can pinpoint her location. This chip hides her. And why not just blow it up? Skouras would just build another. This chip prevents Bo's signature from showing up on their sensors, but Bo only. So they won't know the machine isn't working. Exactly. Are you positive this is gonna work? I was on the team that developed the prototype machine, so I'm reasonably positive. There's a catch, miss Channing. This chip has to be inserted directly in the machine. At Orchestra? Yes. That's not a catch, Winter, that's suicide. Orchestra upped security since our escape. They expanded surveillance, electrified the fence that runs the perimeter. They have armed guards that patrol every inch of that campus. So you're saying there's no way in at all? There is. There's an abandoned sewage line that runs underneath the facility. It was never put on the grid, so there would be fewer eyes than going topside. Good. Miss Channing, understand before you take this on, if you're caught, there'll be no one coming to rescue you. I know I'm on my own. Look, there's no telling how long we're gonna be here, so we're gonna have to get some ground rules going if we're gonna play daddy/daughter. Okay, like what? Like you can't keep living like such a slob. You're gonna have to start doing some chores, basics at least, like taking out the trash - and cleaning up your room. - We don't have a house. How can I take out the trash? And no mind stuff either. You remember what Winter said. Deal? I should probably go to school. You can't go to school. They'd find you. They'd find me. Okay? - What grade are you in anyway? - No idea. No idea? Great. Well, maybe we could do that... what do they call that thing? Uh, we could homeschool. You could... hello? Bo? I'm right here, talking. What are you doing? You're doing your mind thing, aren't you? I can't help it. Sometimes I just feel what these people feel. What's she feeling? That she's not pretty. That ridiculous. That girl's beautiful. She doesn't think so. What about them? That family over there. The one that looks like they belong on a catalog cover. They look normal. They aren't. The dad's ashamed. Ashamed? Of what? He's got a hot wife, couple of cute kids. He's doing all right. He's made some bad choices. That guy, right there? Get outta here. He's gonna do something bad, and he's gonna regret it. Can we help him? Bo, we spent the entire morning attempting to fake being normal. We can't just... Bo, don't do that. Do not do that. You promised Winter you wouldn't use your powers. Bo, I'm serious, if you're doing one of your little spooky things, that is not normal. Bo, okay, okay. Just stop, just stop. What do you want me to do? Thank you. You have a good day. Thank you. Nice looking crew you got there. You too. Nice to have family. Yes, it is. Okay. Hey, man? This is gonna come out of left field, but... Well, my little girl here, she... how do I put this? She... she has an instinct about things, and... Well, she's worried about you. She's worried about me? I am, I'm worried about something you might do. Okay. What do you think I'm gonna do? Can I hold your hand, Gary? - Please? - You know my name? Please? We don't want that to happen. Um... Listen, my family's waiting for me. Okay, Miss Channing, if we're right and the Orchestra event sensor control room is located on the second floor of the technology building, then your closest access point is a vertical tunnel 120 yards southwest of here. We'll hijack the security feeds, guide you from there. We're tapped in. Orchestra. I never thought I'd be back here. Makes two of us. You picking me up okay? You hear me? - Okay, let's do it. - Go. All right. Entrance is right down there. I got it. I'm good. We went over it 20 times. You're gonna need that. If something happens, Winter... Keep her safe. I will. Don't let anything happen. Go. He's gonna make a mistake, Tate, like you did, but it's gonna cost him his family. And what about our family, Bo? You and me. You heard what Winter said. We have to lay low for a while. I know where he works. No, I said no, and "no" means no. Are you gonna do something or do I have to do something? Look, I'm doing my best here. Can you give me that much? We have to help him. It's not normal to go helping everybody you meet, Bo. Why isn't it? - Hello, hello. - Hey, guys. We just got back from the mall. Daddy, I got a new sweater. - Hey, you. - Mmm. What's your day like? Oh, well, "B" has ice skating, and Oscar has his math tutor. I have to head over to St. Brendan's because for some reason, I agreed to be on the easter committee. Dad, don't forget, I need poster board. - It's due Tuesday. - Yeah, I'll bring some from the store. Don't worry about it. What's the matter? Who is that? Um, could you take the kids back to the office, please? - Gary... - Please. Okay. Come on, let's go. What are you doing here? You came to us, so now we're coming to you. My children are here, my wife. I appreciate that, I do, but we had an agreement and you have not done your part. I'm gonna get it. I told you. It was due yesterday, Gary. What do you want me to say? Uh, dad, where'd you move the bubble gum? Hi, I'm Oscar. Hi, Oscar. I'm Mr. Stimson. - It's nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too. Doing some business with your father here. It's in the back by aisle three. Go on. That's a nice kid. Nice family. Would hate for anything to have to happen, you know? Lucky for you, Mr. Balfour's feeling generous. You got 12 hours. Miss Channing, you're about to be directly underneath Orchestra's technology building. Make your way to the connection point. I'm under the access shaft. Climbing. I'm in. Good. Halfway home. Sorry, closed for lunch. You didn't do it, did you? I'm sorry, what? The man came. But you didn't shoot him. Did you? No, I didn't. Great, problem solved. Let's go. But he still wants the money. Yeah... He does. Who are you people? This place has been in the family for two generations. Mom and pop, you know. But we really can't compete anymore, not with the big box stores. They just undercut us, and there's no way we can win. Been borrowing against the place since '08 till I finally ran out of options, so... I took some money from a guy that I shouldn't have, 'cause he was my last option. If I hadn't, we'd have shut down a year ago. What do you got to come up with? Almost 100 grand. Whew. How much time you got left? Got about nine or ten hours. Said if I don't come up with the money, he's gonna... he's gonna hurt my wife... My children. I don't know what to do, 'cause I love my family... More than anything. Winter, I'm about to enter the second floor. I'll be vulnerable to their security systems now. No problem. Accessing your current location. - We've got you covered. - Very good, Miss Leeds. Surveillance loop has gone live. I can hold it for the next 15 minutes, tops. Copy. Direct me to the control room. Security cameras show the room is empty. I really am having doubts. Well, that makes two of us. This could just be a really bad idea. It's not. We have to do this. Maybe you should take my gun. Mm-mmm. We don't use guns. Milton said so. Yeah, we don't use guns. Well, this guy, Balfour, he doesn't feel that way. Look, man, I know what it's like to have nothing but tough choices. - This is why you're helping me? - No. I'm helping you 'cause I'm being blackmailed by a ten-year-old. - It's true. - Look. I've dealt with these kind of guys before. I'm just gonna go in there and see if I can't buy you some time. Can't tell you how much I appreciate this. Don't mention it. I'm proud of you, Tate. I'll be back in five, I hope. - Sir. - Thank you. Mr. Balfour? Thanks for seeing me on such short notice. I know why you're here. Pleading mercy for Gary Wise. More time, am I right? - Yes, sir, I was... - Wise came to me of his own free will. I gave him a loan. The note's due. Yeah, a deal's a deal. I understand that. Do you? Because I didn't get all this letting guys weasel out of an obligation. No, but you're a businessman, obviously. Sometimes a deal can be improved to the benefit of both parties. You got a pitch? I'm waiting to hear it. - I'm an idiot. - What happened? How do I get myself into these situations? - He wouldn't budge, would he? - All I wanted to do was lay low, be normal, and let the kid be a kid. Tate, stop. Just tell us what happened. - Did you work something out? - I knew there was no chance. No, we worked something out, okay? - We did? - Yeah, we did. What? We got to get a horse. A horse? - Yeah, a horse. - I love horses. - I'm confused. - Apparently, this guy Balfour's a breeder, and some jerk won a horse off of him in a bet, and the guy thought the bet was rigged, so he wants the horse back. So we get this horse, and the debt's forgiven? Yeah, if we get the horse in the next... Six hours, yeah. So let's go get a horse. - Why are you so excited? - 'Cause I really love horses. Okay, I'm at the access console. Pass code is zero, three, one-niner, seven, two. Nothing's happening. Are you sure? I think so, as long as the encryption software is working properly. Oh, God, please don't tell me that. Oh, wait, no, I'm in. Hey. I love horses. Love horses. I love horses. Yeah, I think you mentioned that. - You don't like them? - Hate 'em. They scare me. Horses are smart and sweet, like people. You sound like your mom. - Were we alike? - Yeah. Both crazy. Remember, you have to finish the story. Yeah, I remember. Next tuck-in, okay? Okay. You sure you want to do this? No, but we're gonna. Ground zero. Here we go. Do you read? All corridors are clear. Miss Channing, you're in. Yeah, not for long. Okay. Okay, Leeds, I have access to the panel. See the blue wires? First thing you're gonna do, gently pull out the ends of the blue wires. Blue wires. I do not see any blue wires, Leeds. I have purple, yellow, green, red. Teal? Do we have teal? - Is periwinkle an option? - Okay, okay, I'm on it. Channing, trouble, trouble approaching, coming towards you. Here we go, I got you. You see a wire, orange and white, but entwined? Pull that out. Yes, I have orange and white. - Are you sure, Leeds? - Positive. It's Skouras. It's Roman Skouras. You've got ten seconds. Now, attach the wires to the scrambler chip. - Is that it? - That's it. It does not sync with my office. For some reason, the signal is getting fractured. No, maybe the mainframe. There's something wrong with the mainframe. Would you check it, please? Would you, please? Hey, wait. It's back up, it's back up. What can I do for you, missy? I want to ride a horse. - Is that so? - Yes, sir, it is. Well, I'm afraid you've come to the wrong place, 'cause we don't have any horses here you can ride. What do you mean? You have tons. These are racing horses, young lady. I can race. Hey, can I help you? Hey, damn right, you can. I just checked the stalls one row over, and they don't pass muster, not by a long shot. They were mucked this morning. Yeah, okay, whatever. Look. My owner comes down here, sees the stalls looking like that, heads are gonna roll, my friend, and yours will be the first. - You got it? - All right. - I'll get on it right away. - Yeah, I know you will. Let's go! Chop chop! This is what we call a Tennessee Walker. Over here, we have Arabians, and that's what we keep out here. - I got a few more you might like. - What about the next page? - Aw! - Ooh, pretty. Okay. White horse, stable 16. I swear, if you bite me, I'm gonna punch you. Oh, what about the red ribbons? - What are those? - Well, there are three prizes in horse racing, and the blue one, that's first, that's called "winning." Then there's "place," and then there's "show," and if you really want to see a winner... excuse me a minute. What's the matter with this thing? Jammed up on me. I got a key back here somewhere. Think twice before you do that, Zoe. - I know things about you. - What are you doing here? You know what I'm doing here. You should've came with us. It's a little late for that, I think. But it's not too late for Bo. I know you care about her. Okay, we all do. Just remember who all this is for. I never saw you. Tell me you didn't do something - you weren't supposed to do. - Okay, I won't tell you. Come on. That tip Roman Skouras gave you about our favorite fugitive William Tate - being alive and well? - Yeah? Guy matching Tate's description... 6'1", shaved head. - That's a million guys. - In the company of a little girl matching Bo's description, identified stealing a horse in Delaware. A horse? In Delaware? What, they're cowboys now? Security camera caught Tate and Bo in action. I've alerted the local P.D. they're on it. Okay, so far so good. Keep that thing away from me, all right? Okay. Hey. Don't speed, okay? Don't do anything that's gonna attract attention to us, - and we'll be all right. - We'll be all right when we deliver this horse. Okay, so we got an hour or so till the deadline, and we're about five minutes away from Balfour's place. Good. All right. She likes you. Yeah, well, she's confused. We should get a horse. I knew you were gonna ask me that. You're a mind reader, like me. - So can we keep it? - No. I knew you were gonna ask me that too. - How do you do that? - What? Get along with everything? I don't get along with you. All right, hey, hey, whatever you do, you do not use your powers. You understand me? - Okay. - Got it? Yes. - What do I do? What do I do? - Okay, just take it easy. Pull over, nice and easy. If you put your foot on the gas, there's gonna be 500 cops on us in no time, you got it? Yeah. Have a visual on suspect and in process of pulling him over. Copy that. Advise if you need backup. License and registration. - How you doing, officer? - Fantastic. License and registration, please. Stay in the vehicle and take the keys out of the ignition. Hold on, Tate. Hold on! - Hold on to what? - Hey! Hey! I need backup. Hey! No. No. - Winter, I'm blown. - What do you mean? They welded the grate shut. They know I'm here. They must have seen her before we cut the feed. All right, don't panic. We'll get you out of there. - Head back to level two. - Did you hear that? - Winter... - Level two. Stop where you are! Miss Channing. So nice to see you again. That is a long way down. You're not gonna fall. This horse doesn't like me. He wants me to fall. - He's a she. - Whatever. Where do we go? Doesn't matter. We're totally lost. You know what, I'm not digging this. I'm not... I'm off. Uh, whoa, hey. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. - No... okay, I'm down. A little too late to help Gary anyways. Don't hold it like that. You have to be in control of the horse. Yeah, well, it weighs a ton, so I think it's pretty obvious who's in control. You're jerking it too much. You do not know how to guide a horse. Will you stop lecturing me on the horse and get down? Stop! Hey, whoa. Whoa, hey! Hey! Hey, whoa! Stop! Halt! Oh! Ugh! Don't say anything. I don't need any lectures on how I was the problem, you got it? Look. - I think I broke my rib. - Look where we are. Dislocated my knee. - Look where we are. - What? The Balfour estate. Okay, let's go. Good girl. - That was funny when you fell. - Yeah, it was real funny. It really was. Mr. Balfour appreciates doing business. So Gary here is all square? All square. Hey. Who is that? Um, some folks I'd like you to meet. This is my wife, Monica. This is Tate and Bo. - Hey, nice to meet you. - Hey, nice to meet you. Hi, Bo. Nice to meet you. And this is my daughter, Bridget, and my son, Oscar. This is Tate and Bo. Okay, just so we're clear, what happened today is not a good example of normal. So from now on, when you want to help somebody, the answer is absolutely no. It's nice to help people. Not if you almost die. Not when you break a rib. No, what Gary does from now on is Gary's problem. - You understand? - Gotcha. Okay. Second thing: I'm the dad, you're the kid. Kids do what their... their parents say. You're thinking about mom. Why didn't you guys stay together? You really want me to jump to the end of the story? No. It can wait. She loved you. I know she did. Hey, Bo. Hi, Leeds. Come on. Hey. Hop in, honey. Milton! Ohh! My princess. Hey, Bo, why don't you take the tour, check the place out? - Hey, right there. - Okay. What happened? I can tell something's wrong. They have miss Channing. You sure we're safe? There's no way they can locate Bo? The scramble chip worked. Bo is untraceable. She's safe. All right. Bo, it's time to practice. So give it your best shot. Pyramid. We have a signal. Stand by for exact location. Can I help you? Who are you? Dani. Sync & corrections by wilson0804 www.Addic7ed.com
