 Previously on Believe... Bo is a very special little girl. She is starting to become the person she's going to be. Tate is suspected to be in the company of this little girl. Roman Skouras runs the top secret project "Orchestra." Skouras is our partner. We consider him erratic and not to be trusted. I intend to use every resource at my command to recover Bo. Promise me that if I'm gone you'll take care of her. I am honoring Nina

 by protecting her daughter, Bo. You don't care about Bo, Roman. We wouldn't have signed on if we knew this was the outcome. Then go. Tate's in custody. Where is he taking her? Hey, on the ground, Tate, right now! Honestly, have you ever? The gun just fell apart. I mean, what are we dealing with here? So they fled on foot this way? Yeah, rounded the corner and headed for the subway station. That's where you caught up with us.

 Director Lofton, I can't fulfill my objective without all the information. I gave you permission to raise the terror alert to yellow. You have ample resources. Sir, I put out an Amber alert on a child and I don't know who her parents are. That is a disadvantage. There are leads we could pursue. The mother's name was Nina Adams. - Was? - Died in childbirth. The father is your fugitive. Wait, wh... William Tate is... The girl's father. So who are we returning Bo to if she's already with her parent? Bo Adams is a ward of the U.S. government, Agent Ferrell. She has no parents. We're just arriving on 105th and the west end. - We're at 79th and Broadway. - We'll be waiting. Not another one of your so-called safe houses. Temporary till we can get you guys off the island. Which begs the question... New York was a mistake, okay? Yeah, it's funny how they look for convicts, isn't it? You can go back to prison if you'd like to, Mr. Tate. You know what? I might take you up on that. I'm about at the end of my rope. Three days with no sleep. None of us have slept. - Do you understand that? - Me either. And I'm starting to get the feeling that you don't have a plan. The plan will be revealed in good time, Mr. Tate. Yeah, and I'm getting pretty sick of hearing that line. You know, you complain a lot. How does it feel to be given life lessons by a ten-year-old? Feel pretty good? We should go. Steady progress. He's come a long way. Not far enough. If we push him much harder, he's gonna get sick. I don't care about Joshua except insofar as he's able to help me to recover Bo, something he won't able to do unless he's stronger. Am I making myself clear? Do you have a problem with what I'm asking you to do? No. Keep pushing him. We're almost there. It's right here. Come on. Come on. Come on. It's a little makeshift, you guys, and I apologize. But you won't be here long. - You're kidding. - I'm not kidding. It's an icebox in here. Look at this dump. This is no place for a kid. It's not that bad. Well, you have low standards. You'll be safe here for 12 hours or so. 12 hours? That's it? Don't unpack. Why can't we come with you? Because if we're all together and we get caught... - Hey, there's a backyard. - Bo. Bo, I need you to stay inside, sweetheart. You got to stay inside. Mr. Tate. Don't move until I say. I move when I want to move, chief. Look... I know the last few days have been difficult... But I need everybody to stay strong. I will find a way out of this. And you will be safe. All of us will. Promise? You know I promise. Keep your phone on. Bo is your only responsibility. Got it. I'm the babysitter. Of a very important baby. Her mother's dead. Her father's a criminal. What do you think? A foster home? I just want what's best for her. Me too. But having some foster family raise her out there? She needs parents, Roman. She needs you. I'm... I'm not a father. She has a connection to you, Milton, just like Nina did. Think of what she means to the world. She's the beginning, Milton. We could start a program with her and the others we found. Department of defense is on board. They saw Nina's test. They recognized the potential. It's everything we've hoped for. We can do it... change the world for the better, starting right here, right now, with her. - synced and corrected by chamallow - - www.addic7ed.com - - I'm cold. - Yeah, me too. Hey, there's a fireplace. We can't start a fire. It's a dead giveaway. Don't even think that thing works. Tate? What? Why were you in prison? I shouldn't have been. But what did they say you did? Thought you could read minds. I want to hear what you say. They said I killed someone. Did you? No. I believe you. I appreciate that. God, even prison had central heat. Here. Take these. No, I think those would look better on you. Okay. These telekinetic events are linked to stress. You panic her, it's only a matter of time before people are gonna get hurt. You need to call off the Amber alert. And then what, cross my fingers and hope she wanders into a precinct? You're not gonna find her using conventional tactics. Dr. Skouras, I don't tell you how to fold proteins. Don't tell me how to capture fugitives. Keep your focus on Tate, Winter, and the Orchestra fugitives. Use your people to find Bo. Corral her, but do not approach. Leave that to me. And why the hell would I do that? Because the girl is stronger than you are, because you might not be the one to walk away, and because I'm the only one who has any chance... real chance... to bring her in. Bo? Bo! Bo. What? New York's gone to yellow alert. What's that mean in English? It means all traffic on and off the island will be searched thoroughly. So we're screwed. I prefer operationally challenged. How's Bo? Bo's fine. Do not let her out of your sight, - do you understand me? - Yeah, no problem. Got it covered. Can I use your phone? Thank you. Tate's ankle bracelet has him two blocks away from the safe house, Winter. He's gonna blow the plan. Enough. Enough. Miss Leeds, where are we? They're allocating extra resources at the ports, tunnels, anywhere in or out of Manhattan. Winter, I know you think he's important to her... If we're gonna be successful, he's critical. But you have to acknowledge what's happening here. Tate only cares about himself. He doesn't listen. We're gonna lose her. We're not going to lose her. Where'd you get those? - What? - The mittens. Haven't I seen you somewhere before... Last chance. Where? Some kid, five minutes ago. I was cold. She gave them to me. She asked how to get to an address. I told her to take the bus, get off at 75th. This is your stop, honey. 75th and Broadway. Thanks for the help. It's unacceptable. I don't care how you do it. Just get the signature. Hold on. I'm not buying any cookies, subscribing to any magazines, or donating to any causes. - I'm not selling anything. - Great. Good-bye. Wait, I need to talk to Katherine. I have something for her. Katherine, get that. Hiya. What's going on, sweetheart? Hi, I'm looking for Katherine... Katherine Zalben. I'm Katherine Zalben. Where are your parents, honey? I have something for you. Where'd you get this? I found it at your old address in the backyard. I'm sorry, but... are you sure it's for me? Yes, ma'am. I'm sure. How... Look in the envelope. There's more. Matt still loves you. Command center? I need everyone's attention, please. Excuse me, who the hell are you? Special Agent Elizabeth Ferrell, FBI, taking command by federal order. You don't have the authority to come in here and take command of anything. I don't have the authority. I have permission, straight from Director Lofton, so unless you want to be a rent-a-cop in Yonkers by the end of next week, sit down and listen up. Put this up, please. As of now, the NYPD has one solitary objective: Find these fugitives. William Tate, Milton Winter, Janice Channing, Luke Hayden, Lila Leeds, Robert Gilman, and most importantly, this little girl named Bo Adams. I need this message communicated to all officers in the five boroughs immediately. Am I clear? Are you okay? Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay, I think. Who's Matt? Can... can I ask that? Who is Matt? Well, that is a good question. Matt is a guy I used to, um, well, be in love with. We started dating back in high school. I was so proud when he joined the army. But then he broke my heart. He sent me a letter from Afghanistan. He said he never wanted to see me again. And you never knew why? My parents were glad. They thought he wasn't smart enough. Wanted me to marry a doctor or something. Do you... do you think they... Hid this letter? You should ask them. They passed away, honey. Oh. Well, then, you should go talk to Matt. Maybe you can be together now. You are sweet and so nice to bring this all this way, but... I can't go see him. Why? Because I'm already engaged. - Is that Joshua's signal? - Yes, sir. Your telekinetic event sensor is now fully operational. We are now able to track any telekinetic activity within moments of the event. How much range does it have? 75th and Broadway. Next stop, 75th and Amsterdam. Kid, you scared the crap out of me. You can't just run away like that. Don't ever do that again, you understand me? Sorry. Yeah, well, sorry doesn't cut it. Now, let's go. Did you not hear what I just said? Yes. I'm not coming. Am I... am I losing my mind here? No. I'm just not coming. Okay, then where you going? Matt's house. And, if you don't mind, who the hell is Matt? Katherine's boyfriend. Oh, yeah, Katherine's boyfriend Matt. Of course. Him and Katherine were in love, but they got broken up. But they have to be together, so I'm here to help them. Look... I understand that you have these little moments. You're a little different, and that's hard sometimes. But I don't have the luxury of worrying about your little charity missions. I care about me not going back to prison. But she still loves him. You mean like this kind of love? Like that? Yeah? Let me tell you something about that kind of love. That kind of love is cooked up in Hollywood, where everything's fake and happy. It's not real love. Real love is grittier. It comes and it goes, and it works out, like, maybe 30% of the time, and even then it's... it's a lot of work. It's gut-wrenching, pride-swallowing work. How do you know? 'Cause I'm not as unlovable as I look. Somebody loved you? She said she did, anyway. And you loved her too. Thought I did, yeah. She left you though. Yes, as a matter of fact, she did. I'm sorry. Thank you. Come on, we got to get back to the safe house. I'm not coming. Yeah, you are. Come on. Hey, don't ever do that again. I have to help them. What the hell's wrong with you? Bo, wait. Got it. Ferrell. Luke Hayden, get on your knees right now. FBI! Get on your knees right now! Cuff him, guys. We got one. Kidnapping, theft of government property, attempted murder. Wh... attempted murder? March 16, 2013. You pointed a weapon at a private security contractor during the kidnapping of Bo Adams. I have his statement here if you'd like me to read it. No, I wouldn't. I can see why you feel that way. But you know what I don't get? You're part of this top secret program, you're working all this hocus-pocus, and then you gamble your career, your life, everything. I mean, what is so special about this kid? As I lift my hand, you're gonna rise from the chair. I can't do it when I'm awake, only when I'm asleep. Let's try again. - As I raise my hand... - Yes. Minimal intensity, doctor. Ow! Why are we doing it like this? Negative reinforcement's a strong motivator. But I'm trying. - I'm really trying. - I know. Good. You'll get there. Again. Ready? When I lift my hand... Ow! That was harder. Yes. Yes, it was, Bo. You're doing so good. Okay? I know it hurts. You can do this, Bo. What's this? Just a different motivational technique, Milton. - I wasn't informed of... - We know stress triggers a telekinetic event, do we not? That doesn't mean we should abandon... - I'm not harming her. - She's not a lab rat. Do you think any scientific advancement was made by someone who didn't have the stomach to explore the truth? Truth? I... I can't let you do this. It's not your choice. This is my program. If you don't like it... be a scientist, for God's sake. Let's try again. You can do this, okay? I don't want to do it like this. Just a few more times, all right? Just breathe and stay calm. As I raise my hand... Get away from her. Get away! It's all right. It's all right, sweetheart. Okay, come on. Come on. Come on. That is... enough. It's okay. Bo. Bo? We got to get our act together. We're not gonna make it like this. Go away. Come on, kid. Give a guy a chance. Why should I? Look, I'm... I'm trying to apologize here. You're mean. You're right. I am mean. I'm sorry. You should be. What else? What do you mean, what else? That's it. I apologized. Take back what you said about love. No. Can't do it. Can't lie. It's not my style. Not good enough. Where you going? Matt's house. His address is right here. Good lord, you're stubborn. You remind me of me. - I'm going. - Okay, hey, wait. What if we go find this guy Matt? Then will you do what I say? Look, I know I'm a bad babysitter, okay? Can we just make a deal and help each other out? You are a lousy babysitter. Probably the worst in American history. Okay, that's a little much. Actually, no, you're worse than a wolf or a drunk cowboy. All right, you're just gonna pile it on. That's fine. Telekinetic GPS up and running. Subject in position. Location unknown. Go ahead. We're ready. Okay, Josh. I want you to read Mr. Gore here. Read his thoughts. Mr. Gore, I want you to think of something specific. That's crucial. Just a singular idea. Begin. Might be too far out. Mr. Gore? Are you okay? My head is killing me. Joshua, stop. You're hurting him! Triangulating. Boom, got a fix. Southwest Pennsylvania, somewhere in a five square mile radius. If the signal were stronger, the location... It works. That's what matters. We can find Bo. Or a zombie that only eats kids. Better. Or someone with chicken pox. They'd be a better babysitter. This is the place, right? Yep, that's him. You Matt Railsback? Yeah. We have something for you. Take it. Where'd you get this? We're friends with Katherine. She misses you. You should go see her. See her? Would if I could, you know? Katie and I, we were never supposed to be together. Her parents had this idea that she was gonna marry some doctor or Wall Street guy. You know, it just wasn't me. But what are you gonna do? I fell in love. Hard. Six months in Afghanistan, and she was all I thought about. When I woke up, everything was dark. I figured Katie shouldn't be stuck taking care of a guy who can't see, so... didn't tell her what happened. Just ended it. She still loves you, Matt. You're thinking it over. I know. Should I turn state's evidence, save my own ass? It's a lot to consider. But we are talking about life in prison, my friend. Are you really willing to go down for Milton Winter? I mean, what has he ever done for you? All you need to do is give us something actionable... And then you go back to your life, back to normal. Winter has set up a command center, a place to track the pursuit. That's why you haven't caught him. Okay, we're gonna need a location. Let's go in, guys. Let's go in. Katherine. Hi. Wow, I didn't expect to see you here. Someone told me you worked here. Yeah, who's that? Go. Go talk to him. Told you. True love. Yeah, yeah. Come here. Happily ever after. Oh, come on! Told you not to do that. I wish you'd told me. I wouldn't have cared. I loved you. I wanted to spend my life with you. But it's too late. I'm engaged to someone else. I get it. I want you to keep this. I'm sorry. What's she doing? Looks to me like she's leaving. But she can't. They have to be together. They're supposed to. Hard truth. Life ain't a movie. Come on, we gotta get back to the safe house before Winter blows a gasket. Look, sometimes things don't work out like you want 'em to. - Trust me, I know that story. - Sure. Let's go, come on. We gotta get back to the sa... Bo, I'm not gonna sit here and argue with you... - No! I have to help them. - Oh, great. That's just what we need. Come on! There you are. Confirmed: Address registered to Milton Winter. Time to earn our paycheck. Go, go, go! Take the door. FBI! Milton Winter! Federal agents! FBI! Damn it! Hayden. - Ferrell. - We've located the girl. Are you sure? Beyond a shadow of a doubt. Upper West, 92nd and Riverside. We're all over it. Remember what I told you. Contain but do not approach. If Bo becomes angry... Don't tell me how to do my job. Any blood spilled will be on your hands. You know what, Dr. Skouras, I don't get that. I didn't come up with this program. I didn't find Bo or develop her. You did. So whatever happens, it's not on me. Get me the command center. Winter, I'm having a lovely day. Get to the 79th Street boat basin. - Your boat's about to leave. - My boat? I have a small window, Mr. Tate. About 15 minutes. There's a massive police response headed toward the Upper West Side. - You don't say. - 15 minutes. The whole city's on wide alert. We got to move. Now. Didn't expect you home already. Me neither. Never guess who I ran into. Matt Railsback. How is he? Not great. He was wounded. Remember, he was in Afghanistan. Yeah, right, right. I forgot he served. Kind of the weirdest thing. He told me that he asked me to marry him back then. He even sent me a letter from the front. Just because a guy sends you a ring doesn't mean you would have married him. What'd you say? I said it doesn't mean you would have married him. No, that's not what you said. Look, you were dating this broke loser who was 3,000 miles away, and I didn't think he deserved you. We were meant for each other. That's why I did it. You took it. Yes, I... I did. I saw it in your mailbox, and I read it, and I was just... I'll be honest with you, I... I was scared. Katherine, I'm sorry, but... It worked out for the best, right? I mean, I make plenty of money. We live in a beautiful home. You have everything you could want. We're happy. Aren't we? Hurry, kid. We got five minutes. Wait, Tate. Taxi, taxi! Come on. Confirmed sighting for William Tate getting into a cab. Cab number B6Z5. We got a possible getting in a cab. 90th and west end headed south. That's not far from here. Come on, man. Step on it. Speed limit's 35. Look, I'll tip you any amount, okay? Just get me over the West Side highway as fast as you possibly can. - Out of the car! - Out of the car, Tate. William Tate, get out of the car right now. Tate, get out of the car! Move slow and nobody gets hurt, okay? - Driver, get on your knees. - Everything's gonna be okay. Get on the ground right now. Let's go, Tate. Don't do anything foolish. On your knees, sir. Get on your knees! Out of the car, Tate. Everyone nice and slow. We don't want anyone getting hurt here. Just do what we say. It's okay, Bo. We're here to help, okay? It's okay. We're not here to hurt anybody, okay? - Easy, Tate. - I'm gonna put my gun away. Okay, Bo? Okay, I'm putting the gun away. Easy, Tate. Get down on the ground. I'm not gonna tell you again! Get on the ground right now! Guys, guys. It's okay, Bo. We're not gonna hurt you. We're not gonna hurt anybody, okay? We're here to help. Everything's gonna be all right, Bo. You all right? You all right? You're late. Do you have any idea what our little friend just did? I mean, besides deliver chicken soup for the soul? She threw a car. With her mind. Yeah. Did she? How about that? You're getting stronger, like she's supposed to. I think you're good for her, Mr. Tate. Come on. I never expected that Joshua would be able to do this. Gore's mind is wiped clean. Bank error in our favor. Joshua's made remarkable progress. He'll be ready soon. - It happened. - What happened? The happy ending. What are you talking about? Matt and Katherine. They're together. How do you know? I don't know. I just do. Must be nice. Sometimes. Not all the time, though. If you want, I can teach you. I don't know about that. I'm pretty slow. And you know that thing you do can't be taught. But I've learned a few things from you already. Yeah? Yeah. You've taught me a few too. - synced and corrected by chamallow - - www.addic7ed.com -
