 Previously, on Believe... Come on, Bo, you can do this. Come on. - You need to let her be a kid. - Your daughter needs more control... If she can't master this beautiful ability, she won't be able to take on Orchestra. - We're just gonna confront 'em? - Yes. Use your people to find Bo. Corral her, but do not approach. Leave that to me. And why the hell would I do that? Roman Skouras is our partner. We consider him a liar...

 Put the gun down! And not to be trusted. What the hell is wrong with you? - Breathe. - What happened? Yeah, stay with me. Stay with me. - Okay. - Miss Channing, stay with me. - Stop hunting Bo. - She is Orchestra, Milton, and I intend to use every resource at my command to recover her. - Zoe, I need your help. - Where are you? Dani's readings are the strongest we've seen since Bo. I know why you're here. Because of what I can do. You know, I didn't tell them everything I read in Channing's head,

 but there's a traitor at Orchestra. You. Hello? Anybody here? Hello! You shouldn't be here. Why not? Because we're all gonna die. Tate! No. Hey, kid. Hey, wake up. Hey. Hey. Looked like you were having a nightmare. Well, that's a first. Bo Adams is speechless. Hold on, let me call the New York Times. Come here. Hey. Hey, it's okay. It was just a nightmare. It's not real. Okay? It's just a bad dream. It's not just a dream. Something bad's gonna happen, something really bad. What kind of bad? I don't know. You don't know. Okay, well, do you know where it's gonna happen? New York. That's kind of a broad area to cover, Bo. Gonna need a little more information than that. It was in the subway, 30th street. You saw the signs in the nightmare? Yes. We have to go. Can we at least get some breakfast first? - No. - All right. Can you tell me what bad thing's gonna happen in the subway? I told you, I don't know. Like, someone's gonna get killed, or... - yes. - Okay, and can you at least tell me who we're helping today? There's a girl and that woman from the FBI. Ferrell? The one who's been chasing us all over kingdom come, trying to put me back on death row? Yeah. Yeah, I'm not so sure I'm on board with this plan. Please. What's going on with you, kid? You don't get all weepy like that. Where's my daughter and what did you do with her? Not funny. What aren't you telling me? Who's gonna die? - How you holding up? - Great. What were you thinking, taking a bullet for me? You're too important. Until Orchestra is dead and buried and Skouras with it, I would do anything to save you. He was really trying to kill me. Yes, he was, and he doesn't care who he hurts or who he kills, he's gonna do anything to get Bo back. - Antiseptic, please. - Okay. - She get the painkiller? - Yeah, I gave it to her. I need you to just... just breathe. - Okay. - In, out. - Breathe in. - Ooh! Out. Okay. Breathe, breathe. Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait. I thought the "Doctor" in Dr. Winter was PhD. It is. That bullet needs to come out, Miss Channing. Otherwise, you're going into septic shock. Just do what you have to do. Okay. They're holding Dr. Skouras under federal protective custody, which is just a fancy way of saying he's not been arrested, but they're keeping him under lock and key until this is all sorted out. Sorted out? Corey, Roman shot someone. He tried to kill Milton. No, it's not even clear anyone's even been hit. That doesn't excuse it. Well, I'm sorry you feel that way, Zoe. Roman knows how I feel. He's acting irrationally. It's out of desperation. He's protecting what we've built. He's gonna destroy it. Corey, why don't you see that? He's so blinded by his hatred for Milton that he can't see the damage that he's doing. Things will stabilize, and then we'll get back to business. - Come on, Tate. - How's Channing doing? - She's stable. - That's good. You didn't tell Bo about Miss Channing's injury, did you? - No, man. - Good. How's Bo doing? - Yeah, Bo's fine. - We have to hurry. But she had one of her dream vision things. It's a good thing, Mr. Tate. It means she's growing. I don't know about that. I don't think a kid should have that much weight on her shoulders. This is her gift to the world, it's who she is. Yeah, well, that gift has got her pretty damn upset, Winter. I've never seen her like this before. - Bo. - You come on! No, I'm not waiting for you. Come on. Something's under her skin. She feels things, maybe even more deeply than we do. What exactly is it that is upsetting her? - Let's go! - I don't know, she won't tell me, just that we have to get down to the 30th street subway station asap, or some people are gonna get hurt. Is that where you're headed now? One of the people we're running to try to help... FBI agent Elizabeth Ferrell. That's interesting. Yeah, that's not the word I would use. Keep her safe, but you let her do what she feels to do, all right? Yeah, all right. Be safe. Hey, Sasha, don't stand so close to the edge, okay, honey? This train is never coming. Yeah, and guess what? Looking for it isn't gonna make it magically appear any faster. Really? You've been my mother for 16 years, you waited till today to tell me this? - I want a refund. - No, can't do. You are stuck with me, dude. - Hey. - It's not our train. Hands over your head, William Tate! Down, now! Get down on the ground now! - Down, now! - Mom? Sasha, get back! Tate, down on the ground! - We came here to help you. - Agent Ferrell, listen, Bo's telling the truth. Something bad is gonna happen to you. Just do what I say and nothing bad's gonna happen to anybody. This isn't how it happened. - Mom, what is going on? - Sasha, stay back. It's a bomb. It's a bomb. It's a bomb, we have to go. It's a bomb! Come on, run! We got to go! Synced by emmasan www.addic7ed.com Bo? Bo? Bo, talk to me, baby. Say something. Bo? Say something. Talk, baby. You okay? Hey, you okay? My ears. I can barely hear you. Yeah, I know. My head's ringing too. - Hey, you bleeding? - I can't tell. All right. All right, you're all right. You're good, baby. Come on, I'm gonna help you up. Come on. Oh. I got you. Oh. Are you okay? We should be dead. Hey, hey, you saved us. Wait, where are they? - Where are they? - They were right here. Ferrell! Ferrell! Come here. What happened? You all right? Come on. Oh, my God! Oh, my God, Sasha! Oh, my God. Sasha, hang on, honey. - I'll help you, I'll help you. Hold on. - Hang on. - On three, okay? - Okay. One, two, three. Oh! Sasha! You're okay, honey. Sasha, talk to me. - Come on, babe. - It's okay. - Is she gonna be okay? - I hope so. She's my daughter. Hey. - Sasha. - Oh, God, what happened? There was a bomb, baby, but you're okay. Okay? You're okay. We're all okay. I think I have a flashlight. - Perfect. Ugh! - Okay. Oh. Guys, I... we're trapped. How do we get out of here? I don't know. You got any tricks up your sleeve? Sorry, we're a little short on miracles today. Here, Bo, take this, will you? Thanks. What is it, honey? - You are all right, honey. - I can't breathe. Just breathe in and out. Just breathe slowly. It's okay, baby. Come on, you're okay. Sasha. Sasha, come on. Sasha! Sasha! - Dani's files. - You're back. - Um... - I have friends in high places. I don't like how fast we're moving with her. She's damaged, Roman. - She had a brutal childhood. - She killed her brother. Imagine if you had her ability but you didn't understand it. What happened to her brother was an accident, and she's suffered for it ever since. She needs acceptance, understanding, love. She is why Orchestra exists. I thought you understood that, Zoe. We're playing with fire. Dani shouldn't be here. So you don't think we can help her, that here is exactly where she needs to be? No, Roman. I'm afraid she'll destroy it all. Dani stays. You make sure Lofton's office is aware that I'm not happy with any of this. - Absolutely. - Hello, Dani. I am so sorry to postpone our meeting this morning. Something urgent came up off campus. That's okay, Dr. Skouras. I'm just so happy to be here. I'm so glad to hear you say that. I have to thank you. In the few days you've been here you have contributed so much. 'Cause I would do anything to stay here, Dr. Skouras. You can stay here for as long as you like. I want you to think of Orchestra as your home, and I mean that. It's like a dream that this place exists, that you found me. Someone wants to help me. And all we ask in return is that you let us explore your abilities... that we can discover how much you're capable of, how much good you can do for the world. Like you wanted for Bo. - Bo? - Bo Adams. Miss Channing told me about her when I read her mind. Of course. Bo is the strongest who's been here so far, isn't she? Honestly, yes, so far. She's your favorite. I cared about Bo very deeply. But she's not with us anymore. You are, Dani. I care about you now. All of us here do. Something's bothering you. I don't think everyone at Orchestra cares about me. Sources are telling me there has been an explosion at the 30th street subway station. Police and fire officials have been deployed to the scene, but some of those rescue workers are having a very hard time making it down to that subway platform. All of that platform has collapsed. 30th street, where Bo and Tate were headed. And he's not answering his phone. You think they could be there? I got... I got to go find out. Mm. I want you to stay with Miss Leeds. I'll check with you later. You need to be careful, Winter. The scene's gonna be crawling with cops. What choice do I have? I'll be back. An out-of-uniform law enforcement officer had drawn her gun, attempting to arrest an unknown male subject when people saw that gun, they panicked, they ran, and that just may have saved many lives. - Her lips are blue. - What's going on here? Sh-she's not breathing. She's not getting enough oxygen. Her airway noises are better on the right. They're faint on the left. She probably has a collapsed lung. The air's getting trapped between her ribs and her lungs. How do you know all that? Everybody gets basic medical training first year at Quantico. Is she gonna be okay? If it's what I think it is, no, she won't. She'll get worse till she can't breathe at all. - At all? - Here, here, help me turn her over. All right, okay. Hold on. Have to find an air pocket that's keeping Sasha from breathing. There it is. There it is. We need to put something in it to release it. I need something to make an incision. - What, like, in her lung? - In the air pocket. They use a large bore needle in the hospital. We're not in a hospital. I could... I could use a pen. I have a pen. - I-I have a pen. - Take out the ink. I just need the plastic cylinder. - Yeah. Okay, okay. - Hold on there, girlie. All right. Bo, look the other way. I've seen things worse than this before. Please look away. Wait, you sure about this? No, I'm not, but I have to try. There has been an explosion at the 30th street subway station. Police and fire officials have been deployed to the scene. There has been a partial or complete collapse of that subway platform. - Hey, how you doing, honey? - My back really hurts. Your mom had to make a hole in your back so you could breathe. I told you not to look. Who are you? I'm Bo, and this is my dad Tate. - Hey. - Hey. I saw you in my dream, so I came here to try to save you. - Seriously? - Mm-hmm. It's a long story, Sasha. Just try and take it easy, 'kay, while we find a way to get out of here and get you to a doctor. Bo, honey, can you sit with her? Yeah. Ugh, my phone is dead. Mine's all right. No service, though, of course. We're not going anywhere. I think our best bet's just to sit tight, wait for them to dig through this crap and find us. We shouldn't move Sasha unless we have to. Hey, what did Bo mean, you came here to save us? She had a dream, a nightmare. Said that she saw you and your daughter and that you were in danger. So she's clairvoyant too? Yeah, I guess. Sometimes. It's kind of... hit and miss with her. But she knew about the bomb? No, just that something bad was gonna happen. And you let her come anyway? Right in the middle of a known danger? The danger wasn't clear. We didn't... but you knew there was danger? Yeah, I guess. Not exactly by-the-book parenting, is it? Says the FBI agent whose entire job every day is running into danger. It's not the same. I'm not putting her life at risk. I'd do anything to keep her safe. Oh. How about that? We both have something in common. Oh, we're never gonna get out of here. Don't say that. My dad will figure something out. He's good at that kind of stuff. So is he, like, a criminal? 'Cause my mom pulled a gun on him. Used to be. He's not anymore, though. He was in jail for a while, but he was accused of something he didn't do. Hey, did he dig his way out of prison or something? 'Cause maybe that would be helpful. No, he didn't, but it would be helpful. I'm scared, Bo. Don't be. Here. This is Stanley. My mom left him for me. Whenever I'm scared, I just squeeze him. I always feel better. What is that? I thought your phone didn't have service. Yeah, so did I. Winter? Thank God. Are you all right? Yes and no. There was a bomb. - How's Bo? - She's fine. She's scared, but she's all right. Hey, winter, remember how Bo said she saw Ferrell in her nightmare? - Yeah. - Yeah, well, we're here with her, and her daughter's here, and her daughter is hurt pretty bad. - How badly? - She can't go anywhere, but we need to get her out of here pretty quickly. Okay. Let me talk to Bo. Please. Yeah, okay, hold on. - Here, it's Winter. - Hello? Hey, sweetheart. How you doing? I'm okay. But Sasha's hurt. She will get help, Bo. I didn't know about the bomb. If I did, Sasha would have been saved. She wouldn't be hurt. It's all my fault. Hey, hey, hey. Look, that is not true, Bo. That is not true. Sasha is alive because of you. Some things you know, some things you don't know. Some things will always remain a mystery, Bo, but you have your whole life ahead of you to work that out. Okay? Okay. Okay, and Bo, I will always, always be with you. Bye, Milton. Let me talk to your dad. - You still there? - Where are you? At the subway, trapped under about... I don't know, a few hundred tons of rubble. - Any way out? - No, not that we can tell. We can't see anything. Emergency services are all over. It's only a matter of time before they get to you. Got it. Thanks. I assume that was Milton Winter. Oh, they only hire the best and the brightest in the FBI, huh? You can't keep running, Tate. I'm not who you think I am. They're alive. They're alive. But they're trapped. You shouldn't be out there alone, Winter. I will save her, Miss Channing. I will. That's why we're here. Yes, it is. - Sir? - We have a problem. Someone's been lying to me, someone here, inside Orchestra. About what? About aiding the enemy. Zoe's been helping Winter. Dani told me. She saw it when she read Channing's mind. I'm disappointed but not surprised, sir. I should have seen it. She's weak... Just like Winter. I'll have her taken into custody. No. I need to see it for myself. Put a 24-hour surveillance on her. Can we afford to wait? There may be a quicker way. We should save the light. No, no. Mom, please? Just close your eyes, baby, and then you won't be able to tell the light's off. I'll know. Sasha. Fine. - Mom. - What? Do you remember when I was 13 and I asked you for advice on kissing a boy? Hey, there's a kid listening. Don't worry, it's P.G. - You remember, right? - Yeah. You said that the secret to a good kiss was keeping your eyes shut. Worst advice ever. Thanks. Why is it the worst advice ever? A great kiss has absolutely nothing to do with the actual kiss. No. A great kiss... a real kiss has to do with your eyes and their eyes. When you get so close, you can almost see inside of 'em. Yeah. Tate! You okay? You all right? Bo, you all right? - Yeah, I'm good. - Ferrell, Sasha, you guys all right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, we're fine. Wait a minute. Where's that water coming from? Perfect. Now we're gonna drown. - We're not gonna drown, Sasha. - You hear that? Yeah, I do, the water's going down somewhere. There must be a drain nearby. Oh, it's right here. It must have been covered in the rubble. Bo, hold on to this. Oh, it's a drainpipe. It's been here the whole damn time. Hey, hand me that piece of rebar right there. Hey, Bo, hand me that flashlight. Whoa. It's big enough for us to squeeze through. - Yeah, but where does it go? - I don't know, but... Station's collapsed all the way to both ends. No, Winter, Winter, we found a way out. There's a storm drain down here, but we need help navigating. - Can you help us out with that? - Yes, I can. - Give me five minutes. - All right, good. Talk in a bit. Winter. Does Leeds have the computers fired up? - Yes. - Good. I'm going to need survey maps of the storm drain system, the 30th street station. - Okay, we're gonna pull it up. - Good. Winter said there should be an intersection up here another 500 feet or so. - Let me carry Sasha. - No, I got her. Let me guess. You made a few mistakes when you were young. Now you'll do whatever it takes to do right by your kid. Been there and done that. You're a fugitive. You and Bo are living on the run. How does that make you a good parent? I screwed up, all right? I was young. Now I'm just trying to do the right thing by Bo, make up for lost time, find a safe place for Bo to live, somewhere Skouras can't find her. Speaking of which, why do you think Skouras is so desperate to get Bo? That's classified information. You've seen what she can do. Skouras wants to control that. That's why winter took her from Orchestra. That's why we're on the run. Bo has the potential to be the ultimate weapon, and Skouras wants that power for himself. __ My God. Go through there. Right there. All right, that's got to be it. Come on. Stop right here. - Easy, easy, easy, easy. - Ow. - I know, I know. - It's okay. - You got her, Ferrell? - I got her. There's got to be a latch or something. - No. - Here. Does it have an opening, or... Come on! God. You think you can do it? I can't. That's okay. Don't worry about it. Let me try the phone again. - Hey. - Hey, Winter, we gotta talk fast. I'm almost out of battery. We found the shaft, but there's a grate blocking it, - so where do we go next? - You keep going, just another few hundred yards. Careful. Be careful, there are drop shafts in front of you. - Drop shafts? - There are open shafts going down to the lower levels. Fantastic. Winter? Winter? Mr. Tate? Wint... Mr. Tate? Damn it! You just shut that off, right? Oh, this just keeps getting better. Flashlight's dead. Okay. What else do we got? - You got a lighter or matches or anything? - Nothing. Well, we can't move if we can't see. - You okay? - I'm scared. Yeah, I know. Hey! We're down here! Can anybody hear me up there? Help us! Hey! Tate, we can't stay here. Sasha needs medical help... - I know. - Soon. - Damn it. Damn it! - Tate. Tate, I think I can help. How's that, kid? Yeah. Kid, you are getting all the ice cream you want tonight. You think you can keep that up until we get out of here? - I think so. - All right, good. Let's move. Come on. Are you doing this? How? Like I said, Sasha, it's a long story. But that ice cream, it's on me tonight, all you can eat. Winter's not expecting your call because Winter didn't send that message. You? Why? Because I needed to see your betrayal for myself. Dani's accusation wasn't enough, not for you. Dani's lying, Roman. It's what I told you. - I mean, she shouldn't even be... - Don't, Zoe. Don't make this any worse for either of us. Bo! Bo! - Milton! - Hey. Right there. They need medical attention. - Over here. - Over here, guys. I got to go, okay? - I'll be right back. - Okay, okay, okay. - I'll be right back, I promise. - Yeah. Okay, okay. Part of her back, it's gonna need to be cleaned soon. You okay? Yeah. Thank you. No problem. So are you, like, an alien or something? No. I'm just like you. What? That man, that guy in the... in the red jacket. Ma'am, please lie down. He was carrying the duffel bag. That's him. That's him! She's right, that's the bomber. Mom, I saw him in the subway, he had the duffel bag. Stay here, honey. Let's go, come on! He's in the elevator. - Go back with Bo. - Seriously? You don't have a weapon. I'm not letting you go after this guy alone. You're not letting me? No, I'm not. Don't push me, Tate. Go back with the others, and hurry. Ah! Ugh! Really? I'm sorry. I have a sworn duty to the U.S. government. Think about it, you put me back in prison, you're putting Bo somewhere a lot worse. You really want that kind of weight on your shoulders? Orchestra is the future. I don't know who you are anymore. I haven't changed, Zoe. You have, Roman. Ever since Milton took Bo from us, you've become cruel. He shouldn't have taken her. Doesn't excuse what you've done. We are nurturing the next evolution of our species. We must succeed before we tear ourselves apart with hatred and strife and war. What we're doing here is the only hope for the world. If this is our only hope... If you are our only hope... Then I don't want to live in that world. That world will come, Zoe, but you're not gonna be aware of it. What? You won't remember any of this. You won't remember Orchestra. I'm not even sure you'll remember who you are. I only did it to keep Bo safe. I only did it because I love her, Roman. And you love her too. None of that matters anymore. Good-bye, Zoe. The suspect has been identified as Vastly Sheresneski. He is being held under heavy guard at the downtown police precinct, but will be transferred to a federal facility tonight. Stay with us for more on this developing story. - Guess who. - Kathy? - No. - Ugh. Lauren? - No! - It's got to be my Bo. - Hi. - Hi. Hey, Bo, you all right, sweetheart? - Yeah. - Yeah. I got some food cooking in the kitchen. Great. It's gonna be okay. I know it is. Is it really gonna be okay? I can't see the future, Miss Channing... But I believe. I just wanted you to know, honey. I didn't quit, but I told Director Lofton that I wouldn't work the Tate case anymore, and he agreed, as long as we both signed a confidentiality agreement. We can never talk about Bo or any of her abilities. When the time comes, I'm not gonna be quiet, just so you know, mom. Neither am I. So how does it work? What? Seeing what's gonna happen? I don't know. I can't really turn it on and off. Can you see what's gonna happen to you and me, to us? - Mm-mmm. - How about Channing and Winter? Nope. But you'd let me know if you did, right? What if it's bad? Well, I'd still want to know. Give me... give us the chance to stop it. You know, like this morning. You saw me in your dream. I know you saw me there, and... And I was there when the bad thing happened. You don't need to hide that from me. I can handle it. Okay. Okay. Do you think Winter was wrong to take me out of Orchestra? No. Besides, you got me now, kid. - Okay, I'm going to sleep. - Good night. First... You're better at tuck-ins now. That mean I don't have to do it anymore? - No. - Aw, great. All right, good night. - Night. - Aw, good night. Synced by emmasan www.addic7ed.com
