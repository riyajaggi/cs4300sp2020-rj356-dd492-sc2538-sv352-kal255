 Believe (2014): Season 1, Episode 1 - Pilot - full transcript 
 Tate is on death row and has only 30 minutes until his execution. He's visited by a priest who tells him he's there to help him break out - as long as Tate agrees to do a job for him. Tate agrees and soon finds himself employed by Milton Winter - who impersonated the priest - to care for a young girl, Bo. She has extraordinary powers - to sense the feelings of others and the ability to influence those around her, among others. There are powerful forces who want to get control of her and her abilities and Tate's first job is to get her out of the hospital after her foster parents were killed by a highly skilled assassin.

 That's, like, a little greener than I thought. Probably just the pictures. Go around. Ah, this guy... - Oh, my God! - What's going on? - Bo? Are you okay, Bo? - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, they're still on us. It's them. They found us. Hang on. Hang on. Maggie. Are you okay? I don't... I think so. Aah! Aah.

 Take Bo. Take her. Take her. Call Channing. They found her. - I'm coming! - She's unconscious. Don't worry. I'm coming! ¶ Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Are you okay? Are you hurt? Call an ambulance. Maybe this will help. Aah. No. She's just a little girl. Please. I don't care. ¶ Put her down! Don't move her! I'm a doctor. - Somebody call 911. - An ambulance is coming. Oh, thank God. - You getting cell service? - Hang on, guys. - Please. - Thank you. Wake up, cave man, your priest is here. Just a little game we like to play. You gonna be okay in here? Fine. Thank you. Good evening. I didn't ask for a priest. You have such a long history of violence, Mr. Tate. First arrested at 14. After that, numerous arrests for robbery and assault. And now you're being executed for two counts of felony murder in 30 minutes. And you have nothing to confess? I'm innocent. I was set up. Nobody seems to believe you, do they? No one ever did. No friends or family have come to be with you today nor in the seven years that you have been in here. It must be very difficult to maintain hope, remember who you once were. I don't need a confession. Well, thank God for that. We live in a world where everyone wants forgiveness, but no one asks permission. What do you want? I'm here to help you escape. Mostly cuts and bruises, right? Yeah, but she's still unconscious. We need to make sure there's no internal injuries. Stop. Please stop. She woke up? That's her brain? That can't be right. - The system's functioning. - Check it again. Stop it! Just one minute, please. Nope, we're good here. That's weird, right? Stop it! ¶ Turn it off! Thank you. So if I say yes, what's the catch? Well, I'm not just freeing you, I'm hiring you. Last night a man and a woman died in a car accident. They were foster parents to a little girl named Bo. Yeah, this is never gonna work. Ah. Winter, careful with the beads. But this wasn't an accident. It was a failed attempt to kidnap this little girl. But now she's at St. Ann's hospital, and we need to get there before the others do. Yeah, well, guess what. I'm not a kidnapper. I'm not asking you to kidnap her. I'm asking you to save her. This little girl is very important. And you have 4 minutes and 54 seconds to decide. What the hell are you talking about, huh? What, you think this is funny? Are you thick or just stubborn? - I am offering you a way out. - Hey, hey! - 4 minutes and 38 seconds. - Away from the priest! Why would I trust you, huh? Huh? You know what happens when you believe in people, your so-called friends? Enough! Why do you think I'm here, huh? All clear? Clear. No rhythm. All right, give me one of epi, one of atropine. All clear. Doctor, are you calling it? No. Doctor. 11:58 P.M. You did everything you could. I'm sorry, doctor. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I shall fear no evil. You have 50 seconds. Look, it wasn't me. They said it was just a smash and grab. They framed me! I don't care. 40 seconds. 20 seconds. Why me? Because I believe in you. Okay. Hallelujah. Lights out. And system's down. Ooh! Get his hands, get his hands. Feet, feet! Good, good. Now hit him, hit him, hit him. Come on, hit me! Son of a bitch! ¶ Here, take this. Now, down to the left. Go left, to the left! Emergency lights! Hurry! Which key? Which key? The red one. Go, radio him in. Lockdown behind you. He went that way. He went that way. He went that way. Peace be with you. Let's go. Aah! Stop! Stop! Yeah, nice to meet you too. All right, knock it off! Knock it off! Good morning. I'm winter. We'll fly for a couple hours, and we'll talk. How's that for a plan? I didn't ask for cuffs. Yeah, she's a bit exuberant. You don't know me at all. Uncuff him. Why him? He's a murderer. Why not me? Let's talk about this later. Hey. You're Bo, right? I'm Dr. Terry. I'm a resident here. That's a cute turtle. His name's Stanley. My mom gave him to me. My real mom. I don't remember her. So you're gonna need a few more tests, but you're gonna be okay. But there are some other things. Maggie and George? It was a very bad crash. They're dead. I'm so sorry. They were my parents for only two weeks. But they were so nice. The man in the other room... it's not your fault. Excuse me? You can't quit. You're a good doctor. - You saved senga. - Who's senga? Come on. You took care of him. You're tired, Bo. I'll check in on you later, okay? - How is senga doing? - I'm sorry. I don't know anyone named senga. Get some rest. - Ms. Moore? - Hello, skouras. The girl's at St. Ann's hospital. I know. I'll be back tomorrow. Tomorrow will be too late. Winter will be back for her. - Milton winter? - Mm. He's dead. That's what he wants everyone to think. I was very clear. Tonight I have to be out of pocket. It's my mother's birthday. Bo is at St. Ann's hospital on the eighth floor. Call me when you have her. Thank you. Inexplicable phenomena have been part of Bo's life since she was born. These events are unpredictable, and seem to be connected to her emotions. For now, she has no control over 'em. But she is starting to become the person she's going to be. There was a guy Jerome in prison. He could bend spoons. This is very real, Mr. Tate. Oh, Jerome was real too. Couldn't bend knives though. We wanna share her with the world at just the right moment. The people who tried to kidnap her are very powerful people. They want all of her talents for themselves. They think that whoever controls her abilities will control the world. Yeah, even if all of it's true, why me? State-of-the-art GPS tracking device. We'll know where you are, plus or minus 2 feet. That's just to make sure you maintain your end of the bargain. And if you want it off, you'll have to chop off your leg. Well, maybe I'll chew it off. - Be my guest. - Mm. Cleared to land in five minutes. You're gonna get me a gun, right? We don't do guns, Mr. Tate. We're the good guys. Ah. Is it true you gave notice? It's not just about this, is it? I'm sorry to hear that. We think she's in I.C.U. Go in through the E.R., bring her back, and meet Santos there. - This is it. - Put him down, let's go. Let's go now. We got a window. - What do we got? - Fell off a ladder. Contusions on his face and arms, but he's stable. Then park him. We have a bus accident. Let's move, let's move. Come on, let's go. ¶ - sorry. - Excuse me. Excuse me. Where's the girl that was in there? She's stable. They moved her. Dr. weinberg, call extension 4291. Dr. weinberg, call extension 4291. You stink. Uh, fell in a sewer, but they washed me off. You still stink. - I don't. - You do. What's your name? Tate. - You were crying. - No, I wasn't. - Yes, you were. - Well, I hit my head. Those bruises are fake. How do you know? Because... not feeling any pain. - Can I touch them? - No. Ow. You see, it hurts a lot. We have to go. Are you my new foster dad? - No. - Good. Because you stink. Yeah. We established that. - I'm not going with you. - Yes, you are. Winter says you have to come with me. - Milton? - Winter. Milton winter. Where is he? I'm taking you to him. Okay. You know why you were crying? - I told you, it hurts. - No. You remembered you were good once. - Come on, let's go. - God! Mm! Where are you going? Uh, I'm taking her to radiology. Of course. I'll walk with you. - How are you feeling? - Good. Don't worry. I'll take her. Uh, I have to do it. Hospital policy. Hey, you know what? I'm gonna take the girl. I could lose my job, doctor... "Elliot"? You all right? You look a little pale. Please, I don't wanna have to hit you back. It's not a problem. Aah! Aah! Ow! Not cool. Come on, come on! Go, go, go, go, go! Whoa! Stop! Stop, please! Do-who? Hink she'- that lady. Kay? I stabbed her hard in the butt. Yeah, she'll be fine. Who cares? - Where are we going? - I don't know. - Where's Milton? - I don't know. Would you stop talking for a second? ¶ High above there's nothing here ¶ ¶ but you and me I know who senga is. What? Senga. She's not an old patient. We have to find Dr. Terry and tell him so he won't quit. ¶ Dying together ¶ live forever your daughter... she's gone. ¶ Love ¶ we love she's not my daughter. ¶ It's all we know ¶ so can I show you love ¶ sweet love ¶ take time to grow swell. ¶ There's nothing here but love ¶ - hi. - You're late. I have a life too, you know? I'm sorry. - Did he eat? - Not much. I tried though. You can pay me on Sunday. Thank you, Carmen. Hey, dad. A man died today. I tried to save him and I couldn't. First time, you know? I don't know. I've seen people die before, but this guy I was sure I could save. I guess you were right. You remember what you used to say to me? No? I do. You said you wouldn't come to me if I was the last doctor on earth. You were right. You were always right, man. You were always so strong, so full of opinions. So when you got sick, I was gonna fix you. I was gonna... I was gonna cure you, you know? I was gonna show you you were wrong. And you were gonna thank me. You'll be happy to know I quit today. See? You always had the last word. Even when you can't say it. - What are you doing? - I need an address. Well, you can't just run away like that! We need to go to 1422 oswalt street. What are you talking about? I need to tell Dr. Terry about senga. Hey, can you shut up and listen to me for a second, you little brat? Nobody cares! No wonder you had 20 foster parents. You're mean. And you're being stupid. And you have anger problems. Hey, you guys, get in, let's go! - Channing! - Come on. We gotta go, we gotta go. Let's go. Where the hell were you? We were supposed to meet back at the ambulance. Yeah, well, we couldn't get there 'cause some guy was beating the crap out of me. It wasn't a guy. It was a girl. Yeah, I just meant... a girl beat the crap out of you? Okay, yeah, but it was a big girl. She wasn't big. In here. Give me that. Milton! Bo! Come and see me. Ahh. Oh! Look at you, you're getting bigger. No, I'm not. I saw you two weeks ago. Miss Channing, go and show Bo her new clothes, would you? I've got some great stuff. Well done, Mr. Tate. The bracelet... I want it off. - It's not that simple. - We had a deal. I said you come work for me. Yeah, and I did your work. Your work has just begun. I'm sure you noticed that Bo is a very special little girl. Your job is to protect her, keep her safe. What, from that woman? That woman, and all the people that woman works for. Is he gonna be my new foster dad? In a second, sweetheart. He's mean. And he stinks. Yeah, I fell in a sewer. I told you. You see, she doesn't wanna be with me either. We'll be helping you. But the ultimate responsibility for her well-being, her health, her education, that belongs to you. Milton, I wanna stay with you. Come here, sweetheart, come here. Now listen. We talked about this, remember? So if I say yes, how many weeks is this job supposed to last? Weeks? So what, months? They'll be the best years of your life. It took us six months to find the Adams girls and you lost her in one day? Come on, twerp, what do you have? The only relevant data in Baltimore is a property that winter bought one year before he died. The address is 6105 newkirk street. It looks like a warehouse. I'm sending the coordinates to your GPS now. ¶ Yeah! Take a spin. - You look great. - Thank you. Do you like it? The adversary is very resourceful. So keep use of cell phones and other electronics to a minimum. Channing will monitor your whereabouts, your progress. You realize I haven't agreed to any of this yet. Oh, yes, you have. You are all over the airwaves. FBI, police, everybody's looking for you. Well, maybe I'll take my chances. You won't last ten minutes out there. They'll shoot you on sight. Uh, but that won't happen, not with our help. We're not superheroes. But we are dedicated and hardworking people. We can protect you. You still haven't answered my question. Why me? That is for you. I want you to take good care of her, educate her. Good, organic food. Comfy accommodations. You're gonna be raising her now. I need a gun. We talked about that already. Mr. Tate, when you first saw her, you felt something, didn't you? What do you mean? What did you feel? I don't know. I don't like kids. - It's them. - How did they find us? Which floor, please? Quickly. - Stanley! - No, leave him. - No, Stanley! - Stop, come on. No, no, no, no, no. - Hurry up, hurry up. - Go, go, go, go. - No! No. - Tate, Tate! Tate! Come on. No, no! They were here, and now they're gone, Corey. Where else would they go? Check for any other properties, people, any other locations, check it again. I'll wait. Just be quick about it. Hello, thumbelina. Let her go. - Aah! - Milton! I thought you didn't hit girls. Well, I do now. Tate! Tate! No! No! Help him! ¶ Aah! Aah. Stop it! Stop it! - No! - Bo! ¶ Go, go, go, go! ¶ - what about the cash? - Forget the cash. Go, go, go, go, go! What happened? I don't understand. It's okay. It's okay, sweetheart. It's just like all the other spookies, just a little bigger, that's all. - Winter... - Faster, go, go, go. Mr. Tate, all our locations, they were compromised. You'll have to keep moving from place to place. We'll divert her. You've gotta get out, right now. - Where do we go? - Bo knows. Get out. Don't trust anyone. We'll try and find you. Milton! Go, sweetheart, go, go. Take this money. Take this money down there. Go, go! ¶ 120 bucks for the next few years. That's swell. Are we there yet? Yeah, we're here. That thing back there, how'd you do that? What do you mean? That spooky thing, that thing with the birds. What was that? Does that happen a lot? I don't wanna talk about it. Will they give us more dough here? - You mean for cookies? - What? - Terry. - No, come on. Bo, what are you doing here? I need to talk to you about senga. - My friend needs help. - Ow! - What happened? - A mean woman shot him. - You were shot? - It's nothing. - I'm fine. - He's a doctor... a really good doctor. If you were shot, we have to report it to the police. Well, can you stop the bleeding first? I'd appreciate that. All right, come inside. I don't have any anesthetic. - Just sew it up. - All right. Have a seat on the table and lift up your shirt. He's your father. He's barely conscious. He's almost gone. He's part of you. No, he isn't. You can't quit. What about senga? I told you I don't know who that is. - I know. - Antibiotic. I thought you knew senga. Sometimes I get things wrong. You don't know her yet, but you will. It's gonna hurt a little bit. Ooh. Try not to move, please. One day she'll be really sick, but you'll save her. She'll live because of you. - She's a singer. - Yeah? Senga's a singer? Yeah. She's really good. When people are having a hard time, her music will make them feel happy. You'll fix her. You're doing great. You'll fix a lot of people. The same way you're fixing him. One more and we got it. Your father thinks you're a good doctor. He knows you tried to save him. He knows he was wrong. And he's sorry he never said it. He loves you. He believes in you. The bullet barely nicked you. Keep it dry. Try not to carry anything. - And the police? - It's fine. How does she know all of this? I don't know, man. She's a pain in the ass. Terry. Okay, get the anesthesiologist, prepare the O.R. I'll be there in ten minutes. They're short-staffed. They need me. Get that sweatshirt. Come on. Hey, Carmen, it's Adam. I know it's short notice, but I need you to come over. I got called into the hospital. Thank you. Thank you so much. - Good-bye, Bo. - Bye. Thanks. Okay. Now where do we really go? Philadelphia. Look, that was very touching. But if this is gonna work when we get to a new town, we're gonna need some rules, okay? Okay. Number one, that doctor guy wasn't your business. You're nosey. - He fixed you. - Yeah. And that's fine and all. But when we get somewhere, you need to mind your own business. You understand me? What a girl falls into a river? I don't care. Now promise. What if a man is walking on the side of the road, and it's really hot and he drops a penny, and it gets stuck on the melting road, and his hand gets stuck and a truck is coming? That's never happening. But what if it did? ¶ ¶ life doesn't wait for long ¶ - what's her name? - Agnes. Agnes. Winter. How's the backhand? She's protected again. You lost your chance. Protected by Tate. I have to admit, that was a surprise. You know it's gonna blow up in your face. ¶ Skouras is closing in. I can't believe you used to be partners with that guy. Well, the past is a very tricky place, my dear. We'll have to move them from town to town. Well, that's incredibly risky. But let's look on the bright side. Think of all the people she'll help along the way. But you put her with a death row inmate. No, I put her... With her father. What if a piece of the moon crashes into a house, and they keep spiders in the cage, but the cage breaks? And then the people who live next to them have a gorilla who's allergic to spiders? I don't know where to start with that one. What's rule number two? - Always do what I say. - Okay. But what if we're in an igloo and you had a cold and couldn't smell anything, and you told me to light a candle, but I smell gas? You know what? Light the candle. ¶ Sinkin' in the undertow ¶ never knowin' where to go ¶ ¶ or how to find something more ¶ ¶ lookin' for a kinder one ¶ ¶ only then the dreams will come ¶ ¶ knockin' at my door ¶ life doesn't wait ¶ for long ¶ It's gonna be okay. ¶ Life doesn't wait ¶ for long ¶ oh oh, it's the winding road ¶ ¶ oh oh, take the long way home ¶
