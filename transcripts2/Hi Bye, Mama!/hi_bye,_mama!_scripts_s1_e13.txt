 Hey, get up! Do you know what time it is? Come on, get up. -No... -Hey, you're already late! Come on. Hurry. Hey! Hey! The soup's spilling... Goodnight... -"Goodnight"? Come on, get up. -Just a bit more... That's so funny. Oh my gosh. I'd prefer a woman who's cold to every guy. I want a guy who's always kind. WHICH GUY WOULD YOU MARRY?

 A woman who's kind to every man? -I'd-- -Then would you... All right. My goodness. Hey, what is this? Should I tell you why sales are so low? The time that had been flowing with us suddenly stopped one day. I... What? I'm doing my best. -It's too salty. -Oh, really? Don't cry. Don't cry. Don't cry.

 Time stopped for the person I love because of me. I prayed that it would start flowing again. -Hey, Gang-hwa. -Bye. Date that nurse, Oh Min-jeong. Think about it the other way around. What if it happened to you, and you left Yu-ri all alone? Would you like it if Yu-ri lives her life suppressing her feelings because she feels guilty about it? Aren't you Yu-ri's friend? I am. I'll always be on her side, and I'll think from her point of view. I'm doing this for her. You idiot. You loser. MIN-JEONG Yes, press it. Call her and meet her. Come on, call her. CALL Gang-hwa, you used to have so much charisma. Where did it all go? I know you like her. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I must've lost my mind. During the time I couldn't see her, what would she have thought? You fool. You idiot. EPISODE 13: A STORY I COULD NOT SEE What's wrong? What's the matter? Did something happen? You've been next to me the whole time... You saw everything? How could you stand it? You saw... all of that? I'm sorry, Yu-ri. No... I'm sorry, Yu-ri. No... Don't cry. Don't cry. Don't cry... Don't cry... GANG-HWA, WHERE ARE YOU? GANG-HWA CALLING GANG-HWA The person you are calling is unavailable-- Are you crazy? Why didn't you tell me earlier? I found out only recently. If Gang-hwa finds out, how is he going to handle it? Cho Gang-hwa. Hey, Gang-hwa. What's going on? -What's with your face? -You knew everything, didn't you? What? Knew what? That Yu-ri was by my side for the past five years. How did you know? Gang-hwa... She didn't remember. She said she just woke up at a cinerarium. What do we do about Gang-hwa? That's why she couldn't tell him. What? After Yu-ri died, Gang-hwa really had a tough time. He blamed himself. Right. He was just living because he couldn't die. Thinking of that just makes me... But Yu-ri saw all of that. That's why she couldn't tell him. Because Gang-hwa would blame himself again. Hyeon-jeong. I feel so bad for Yu-ri. What do we do? Min-jeong. Hello. Did you happen to see Seo-woo and Gang-hwa? Mom! Seo-woo, what are you doing here? Where's your dad? -Did Gang-hwa go somewhere? -He went somewhere. -What? -Well, he went there. Somewhere. Where did he go? You know, right? -The hospital. -Yes. -The hospital. -He went to the hospital. He got an urgent call from the hospital. And I have dementia, so I keep forgetting stuff. -Pardon? -What? The dads were planning on spending time with the kids, but Ha-jun wouldn't let go of me, so the three of them played together. -So that's why you were with Ha-jun. -Right. -Why didn't you say so? -Sorry. Well, Gang-hwa and I had fun with Seo-woo today, but he just got an urgent call so he left Seo-woo with us and left in a hurry. I couldn't get in touch with Gang-hwa, so I came here just in case. It was an urgent call, so he probably can't answer his phone. Why didn't you tell me sooner? What's the point of telling you? It'd only hurt the both of us. Weren't you hurt when you saw me living a happy life without you? Were you okay with that? It hurt. A lot. Someone else was seeing the smile you used to only show me. And someone else was holding the hand that only I used to hold. And someone else was in the place I was supposed to be at. It hurt. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. But it hurt a million times more seeing you cry alone. You woke up alone, ate alone, and watched Seo-woo alone in an empty house without me. And you... cried alone. That hurt so much that I didn't even get jealous of the other person. It broke my heart, but strangely enough, I felt so relieved. I should've endured all that. I should've endured it even if it was agonizing. You felt enough pain, and you endured enough. I can hardly breathe. How could you do this? Bring her back. Bring her back, you jerk. I only wanted one thing back then. I wanted you to put me behind you and go on with your life. So don't blame yourself. You really love Min-jeong. I know you do. Even if no one in the world can tell, I know it. Gang-hwa. I'm not yours anymore. You can let me go now. I wonder why Gang-hwa came at this hour. I don't know. Yu-ri coming back to life is a huge blessing for us. But it might not be the case for Gang-hwa and his wife. I feel sorry for Gang-hwa's wife. You don't need to feel sorry. We're not asking for her place as Seo-woo's mom or Gang-hwa's wife. We're just grateful that Yu-ri came back to us. I know, but if I knew this was going to happen, I should've opposed when Gang-hwa came to us asking permission for him to remarry. No. Even if I go back to that day, I would still tell him to remarry. I can't see him suffering like that again. Is that why you ran away when you first saw me? You never wanted to appear in front of me? Seo-woo's freezer incident happened because of me. How could I do that to you? The freezer? Why is that your fault? Didn't you hear from Hyeon-jeong? Then who did you hear that from? A man who said he was your friend. He was wearing black clothes... -Who are you? -I'm here for your daughter. Why? Who is he? Did he approach you and Seo-woo? Yes. Where's Seo-woo? Where is she right now? At Hyeon-jeong's. Misaeng. Yu-ri. What is it? What's going on? Seo-woo can see ghosts. What? That freezer incident happened because she followed a ghost. What do you mean, Yu-ri? What... Why would Seo-woo see ghosts? I was always by her side since she was born. That's why she can see ghosts. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. It's all my fault. I'm really sorry. Seo-woo has been watching me. That's why... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Good. Gang-hwa? -Why are you here? -I couldn't reach you, so I came to find you. Why do you look so dazed? Well... It's nothing. It's nothing. Is something going on? What? No, I'm fine. You should've taken her home if you were going to the hospital. Seo-woo, come here. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I'm sorry. It's my fault. Yu-ri. It's not your fault. It's okay. It's okay, Yu-ri. Did Yu-ri go out again? Yes. Are you going to pray again? I should. Mom. It seemed like Yu-ri cried all night-- It's fine, you don't need to tell me. I know. I'm going. Okay. Be careful. What is it? Who's visiting so early in the morning? My gosh. Who is it? It's you. What is it? -Where's that exorcist? -What? Where is that exorcist jerk? I'm going to kill him! Is he in here? -No. -Come out! What's gotten into you? Wait, did he actually find your daughter? Oh my goodness. He's begun now. Come on, why don't you calm down first? How can I calm down right now? A shaman? How can you do that to a six-year-old? All right, just come inside. -Come inside. -Did the deities order this, too? -My gosh. -Did they order this? -Did you hear that? -Yes. The exorcist is after Yu-ri's daughter. He's such a heartless monster. So make sure to avoid him at all costs. One mistake, and we'd be sent up before we see Pil-seung get married. No way. No. -That can't ever happen. -Let's go. Yes, let's go. Are you just going to stand there huffing like that? What choice do I have? There's nothing I can do right now. What? What should I do? I was going to go up when Seo-woo became normal. But she can still see them, and there's a weird exorcist after her. But there's nothing I can do. There is something you can do. Like what? Your daughter can stop seeing ghosts. Don't worry. Trust me. -Are you sure? -Yes, I'm sure of it. So you should focus on your job and what you want to do. What do you mean? You're going to leave soon. There are only a few days left. Will you just waste your time and leave? Is there anything you want to do? Whatever the reason may be, this is a rare chance. There's no time to even do everything you want. Since you made up your mind to leave this world, do everything you want to do. But that exorcist-- Goodness, didn't I tell you? I told you Guk-bong would be back again. But why does he keep showing up? To confirm that your daughter can see ghosts. Once he confirms it, we can't undo this. There are fewer people who can see ghosts these days, so he's not going to lose even one. But you're completely against it. You bet I am. Exactly. Just focus on protecting your daughter and hang in there until you leave. Enjoy your time here. What happens once I leave? What will happen to Seo-woo? Don't worry. She can stop seeing ghosts. Just trust me. Yu-ri. Mom. Why are you here? I... She's not crying. She's just roaming around everywhere. Roaming around? My daughter? In this world? No, that's not what I meant. It's... Mom, are you here to pray? Yes. Why are you here? I just had to take care of something. Let's go, Mom. I was just about to leave, too. Okay. I feel like a sinner because I slipped just once. Once she leaves, how is her mom going to deal with that? Your friend? That shaman is your friend? Yes. She looks way older than you. How is she your friend? Age doesn't matter in friendship. She's nice despite her looks. Did you really come here to meet her? Yes. Mom, what about you? Why do you think? I came here to offer my prayer. I thanked him for sending back my daughter. What if he takes you back because I stop coming to pray? Mom, is there anything you want to do with me? With you? Things you regret not doing with me. I am just happy to be with you. I don't want anything else. You already got her ready? Yes. I'll drop her off at the kindergarten. Gang-hwa, what's gotten into you yesterday and today? What? What do you mean? You're practically glued to her. -Where are you going? -To pee. To pee? Let's go. Where are you going? You've been following her around the whole day. -Really? -Yes. Right. About Seo-woo's pick-up helper... What? -Min-jeong. -Yes? Let's get a new pick-up helper. Tell me why you want a new helper. If you don't tell me, I won't do it. There's a room somewhere in Gang-hwa's heart. It's a room I'm not allowed to open even if everyone else in the world can open it. And that was really tough. You don't have to tell me now, but tell me when you are ready to tell me. Can you come to the hospital later in the afternoon? I'll tell you everything. Why we need a new helper. You're going to leave soon. There are only a few days left. Will you just waste your time and leave? Is there anything you want to do? What was that? Hey, you know that dumb friend of yours? What's his name? Bin or Bong? He's following your friend. My dumb friend? Geun-sang? Yu-ri. Are you okay? I heard everything. How did you go through all that? It's all right. Everything will be okay. -Geun-sang. -Tell me. Tell me everything. I'm all ears. What have you been up to? Why is a ghost following you? What are you saying? Don't make jokes about that. You of all people shouldn't. What's wrong with you? No, that's not true. Why are you making things creepy? Where? Where is it? -Goodness. -Where? Gosh. Yu-ri. Where are you going? Don't go! Tell me before you go! I'm scared. I'm... You give me peace like a river You give me peace like a river Hallelujah You give me peace like a river You give me peace like a river -Hello. -Hello. I'm right about this. It's all over the town. Those two were crying like crazy at the playground. Are you sure it was Seo-woo's dad and the kitchen assistant? -Yes. -She said they were. But she has no idea. They are hanging out like besties. Gosh. Hi, you're here. Hello, Seo-woo. -All right. Take off your shoes. -Take off your shoes. Let's take off your shoes and go inside. Let's go. Say bye to your dad. Seo-woo. -Oh, right. -Okay. Bye. Let's go. He's not okay at all. Are you okay? I mean, she should've told you she watched you for five years. No. How could she tell you that? Goodness. Have you ever felt like you did something awful that you didn't want this person to find out, but it turns out that this person had been watching the whole time? That's how I feel. I know. It feels naked. Hey, but what you did wasn't awful. Is remarrying a bad thing? Why is that awful? She saw everything. Were you aware of it? That she'd stay with you as a ghost? Did you know she'd come back? Don't blame yourself. Yu-ri said this is why she didn't tell you. Gang-hwa, Dr. Jang is looking for you. Observe my surgery starting this week. Pardon? When I do my surgery, come into the operating room and watch. We did enough for counseling. Let's try exposure therapy to overcome this. I'm not confident that I can handle the exposure. Bye. -Hey. You. -Doctor Cho. -Hey! -Doctor Cho. -What should we do? -What do you think? He'll have to do it. What other choice does he have? Will he get fired? Gang-hwa, you can let me go now. Those mothers can't even look me in the eye now. I guess we were pretty scary that day. They can't say anything to me now. Thanks to you, living in this town became a little easier. I'm glad. They won't talk about Seo-woo now. Come to think of it, did I hit them too hard? That shouldn't even count as hitting. You know what? You must think this is some kind of a cafe for moms. This is my place of business. My sacred place of business. Hyeon-jeong! I'm just so thirsty. That hit the spot. Why are you chopping so many green onions? My gosh, it's so spicy. My eyes sting. Hyeon-jeong. I was just passing by. Have some coffee. -Okay. -My gosh. You have a lot of dishes to wash. It's nothing. Hyeon-jeong! The weather is warming up now. Those are some huge anchovies! Oh my. These are good. Are they from Tongyeong? Hyeon-jeong. And Do-yeon. This isn't a place you stop by. What is this place? A place of business. I love it. Having a place I can stop by in my neighborhood. I didn't have any place I could stop by in this neighborhood. This feels like a hideout. -I have an appointment. I'll get going. -Okay. Seo-woo doesn't have lessons today. Play with her at home or at the playground. Seo-woo. Mom! I'm leaving now. Play with the aunt and I'll see you at home. Okay? Bye, Ha-jun. Bye. Goodness. Good girl. Go play. I'll get going. Bye, Min-jeong. Well, we are friends, right? Seeing how close we are, I was wondering if I could call you guys friends. Of course. We are best friends. You bet. Hello. Hi. We have a lot of beautiful accessories today. Look around. FRIENDSHIP BRACELET, SHARE YOUR MEMORIES Give me three of those. Are you giving them to your friends? Yes. -How much are they? -50,000 won. -Here you go. -Sell a lot. -Wear them well. -Okay. It's all my fault. What's wrong with you? Why is this your fault? If I didn't encourage Gang-hwa to date Min-jeong back then... I'm sorry. Why would you say that? I was really thankful to you when you did that. There must be a way. I told the shaman to find us a way. I'm trying to wrap my head around it, but I can't have you leave me again. Hyeon-jeong. Yes? Everyone is having a hard time because I came back. I didn't come back to make people suffer. Because of me, Gang-hwa and you are in such pain. I should have hidden from you guys and never gotten caught. This is not why I came back at all. Why did I get caught? I shouldn't have. What is it? Do you have something to tell me? To be honest, I like you. You're cool. So what? That's why I really wanted to tell you this. You should change your pick-up helper. What? Why? Why must I do that? Everyone is talking about it now, saying your helper and your husband are having an affair. Now, you're spreading groundless rumors? Are we done here? No, people said that they were crying at the playground together. It's true. Please go. Goodness. All right. Let's do it one more time. All right. Here. Goodness. -Harder? -Yes, harder! My gosh, look. I caught it. I got it. All right. Let's do it again. Again. Let's do it again. Goodness. -Throw it far this time. -Dad, you must be tired. Stop it. That's nonsense. I'm still going strong. Right, Seo-woo? Grandpa can play with you for 12 more hours. All right. One more time! -All right. -He's unstoppable. Goodness. Give me a few minutes. -I'll go and buy some cool drinks. -Sounds great. All right. You got it. You caught it, Seo-woo. All right. Look. Grandpa caught it too. Seo-woo, do you want to sit down and rest for a bit? Okay. All right. Let's put this here. Goodness. Gosh. Who do you take after? You have pretty eyes, nose, and cheeks. And even your hands are pretty. Look at them wriggle. My goodness. Oh, no. Goodness. My gosh. Oh, no. -Are you okay? Oh, goodness. -Yes. Seo-woo, don't go anywhere. Stay there. -Gosh. -Oh, no. -I know, right? -Sure. -What should we play? -Let's play with Mimi. -Sure. I like that. -Mom. Mom said she'd cook tteokbokki for us. -Here. -Okay. You should be careful. -Thank you. -Sure. Seo-woo. Seo-woo. Seo-woo. Seo-woo! Seo-woo! Dad. Yu-ri, this is bad. Seo-woo... Seo-woo. Oh, no. Seo-woo... Oh my gosh. Seo-woo! Seo-woo. Seo-woo! I'll tell you everything. Why we need a new helper. He can just say he's uncomfortable because she looks like his late wife. Gosh. PICK-UP HELPER DO-YEON Min-jeong. -What's wrong? -Gang-hwa. What are we going to do? What is it? What? -Seo-woo! -Seo-woo! Seo-woo! Seo-woo! Seo-woo! Seo-woo. Seo-woo. Seo-woo. -Seo-woo. -I didn't do that. Seo-woo. -There's one over there, too. -Seo-woo. Where's she? Seo-woo! Excuse me. Have you seen a girl this big? Seo-woo! Excuse me. Have you seen a girl this big wearing a purple coat? Seo-woo! Seo-woo! Seo-woo! Seo-woo! -Seo-woo! -Seo-woo! -Seo-woo! -Seo-woo! Seo-woo! Seo-woo. Seo-woo. Seo-woo! Oh, no. What are we going to do? She'll be okay. No. What will we do? -She'll be okay. -What are we going to do? She'll be okay. She'll be okay. Oh, no. My poor Seo-woo. Oh, no. Seo-woo! Seo-woo! Seo-woo. What are we going to do? Oh, no. Sorry. I am so sorry. How... How could you lose her? Seo-woo. Seo-woo! Seo-woo, are you okay? Seo-woo. You're okay. Thank goodness. Seo-woo! Seo-woo. -Seo-woo! -Mommy. -Seo-woo. -Mommy... Seo-woo! What were you doing here? -Mommy... -Goodness. Seo-woo. -Mommy... -Goodness... -Goodness... -Mommy... I'm sorry. Mommy... Mommy... Mommy... Our little baby son grew up to be this big, honey. Look at how handsome he is. Our son grew up so well all by himself. He's such a kind and handsome man. He won't be lonely once he gets married, right? Then we can go. Yes, once our son has a family of his own, we can go then. Let's go now. He has a flight today. Safe flight, Jang Pil-seung. Son, have a great day! Have a safe flight, and eat well. Honey! The exorcist! -What? -What? Goodness! You jerk! Take this! Seo-woo. Seo-woo? Come here. It's all right. That's it. Come here. That's it. That's it. Good girl. How dare you? Come here! Come! Come! That's it. That jerk. How dare he try to bully Yu-ri? Seo-woo! Mom, take a step back. -We can't be too close to her. -Yes, you're right. Seo-woo, come here. Come. That's it. Good girl. Great job. That's it. We're almost here. Come here. That's it. Gosh, that looks fun. Try going up there. Go up there and stay in that box. Okay? Over there. There. That's it. Seo-woo, we're playing hide-and-seek. You can't come out of there. Make sure you stay hidden. Okay? Good girl. Let's go. Let's go find Yu-ri. Honey. I wonder what you're doing here. We aren't doing anything. We were just hanging out. Where's the kid? I saw you taking her. Where did you hide her? Okay. Don't say anything. Let's go up. Who is it? Goodness. What's wrong? Goodness, why are you going around not eating anything even after you became a human? You're breaking my heart. It's because I'm human. I wouldn't be like this if I were a ghost. Don't be so smart. Why did you come here instead of going home? My mom will be worried sick if I go home like this. What about that tough lady who's supposedly your best friend? Why? Does she keep telling you to take your place back? Yes. Ms. Mi-dong. I think it was a punishment that I'm back to life. It's not a reward. Ever since I came alive again, everyone is unhappy. Goodness, what happened to you? I'm sorry, but could you please leave? I really don't want to see you right now. How... How can you lose her? How? I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. You're shaken up. She's shocked too. That's why. Let's go. I'll take you home. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come. I'm so sorry. What do you mean? Yu-ri, it's not your fault. It's all right. Why do you always say everything is all right? It's not all right at all. You aren't all right. Yu-ri. I shouldn't have come back to life. It's not like you wanted to. And you didn't get caught because you wanted to. Everyone cries, worries, and sighs when they see me. No one smiles. Everyone is tormented because of me. Everyone who's alive is like that. They think more about tomorrow than today. That's why they have a lot of troubles, sigh a lot, and regret a lot too. If they thought they'd live just another day like you or other ghosts here, there's no need to worry about it all. Goodness. Ms. Mi-dong-- Yu-ri! You're here. You came. When did you get here? When? Yes, Yu-ri came. Our dear Yu-ri. You were sick of this place. Why did you come? This is my home too. I'm glad you're here. -I'm so glad. -I missed you. I'm glad you're here. Why do you always say everything is all right? It's not all right at all. You aren't all right. You must've been shocked. Min-jeong. Why are you crying? Don't cry. It wasn't your fault, okay? Then whose fault is this? Is it because you're at the hospital all day long? I hired a pick-up helper to return to work, then lost my child. And Seo-woo is slower and grayer than most children. If these aren't my fault, whose fault is it? Am I not her mother? Min-jeong. When something is wrong with a kid, everyone blames the mother. Why do you always say it's not my fault? You said I'm Seo-woo's mother. Am I really her mother? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Why are you always sorry and fine? Cha Yu-ri. Those three syllables are taboo words to me. How long will you keep that door shut? How long will you keep that door locked up? You have to open that door for me to go in. That's the only way I can truly be Seo-woo's mom. The pick-up helper. That's her. Yu-ri. Cha Yu-ri. What do you... What do you mean? Seo-woo's biological mother. Cha Yu-ri. She came back to life. Why? You can't seem to sleep? I don't want to waste my time sleeping. Mom, can you sing for me? What? Which song? "Pine Tree." "Pine Tree?" You remember that? I used to sing it for you when you were a baby. It has been so long, so I want to listen to it. Sing it for me. Pine tree, pine tree Your light is evergreen On a lonely autumn day And even in a snowstorm -Pine tree, pine tree -Pine tree, pine tree Your light is evergreen On a lonely autumn day And even in a snowstorm Seo-woo's biological mother. Cha Yu-ri. Pine tree, pine tree You are evergreen Anyway, we established the hierarchy in this chaotic neighborhood. That means we're the bosses, right? This is why we should be careful around kids. You already learned. Exactly, she learns very fast. She called us bosses. Don't laugh like that when older ladies are talking. She should lie down head-first on a bottle cap. You can't do that nowadays. You'll get handcuffed. This world is coming to an end. Let's go out and get some eggs. Okay. Goodness, she won't even stand up to see the older ladies off. Unbelievable. -Keep the restaurant safe, will you? -Yes. I couldn't see the time they spent together, but their time has been passing by diligently. It must've been fun to see how much I loved her like some kind of an idiot. You looked so happy when you were around other people. You should take care of yours first. You're a mess. Will you live as a doctor who can't operate? You need to face this to get better. Why did you leave me all alone? Why did you do that? Do you know what's more desperate than saying, "I want to die"? -Cheers! -Cheers! I want to live too.
