 CHA YU-RI Do you think you own this place? Stop crying! Gosh, I can't sleep. Stop crying and introduce yourself if you're new here. She looks scared and startled. You can't make sense of this, and you're terrified, right? Not only that, she thinks this is terribly unfair. She's so young. She probably never expected to be a ghost before she hit 40. Gosh, I know how that feels.

 You feel wronged and frightened. You can't stop crying because you're sad. Right? My husband does nothing but cry. What am I going to do? What am I going to do about my poor mother? I thought death was just about leaving this life after making the most of the time God has given me. PARK HYE-JIN Hye-jin. Hye-jin. I'm sorry. My daughter... My poor daughter. JEONG GWI-SUN

 You should be in the hospital. You're sick. You should stay in the hospital. My baby. But I realized this after my death. My life was not entirely mine. EPISODE 6: EVEN IN THE FACE OF DEATH, FAMILY IS STILL MY NUMBER ONE That's just ridiculous. I know. You should do it then. A marriage of convenience. Is it decided then? Seriously? -Is it necessary? -I guess you really hate that. -A marriage of convenience? -That's so funny. Welcome. What brings you here, Min-jeong? Well... Soju, no. Give me a glass of beer, please. Okay. Beer has too many calories. Okay. -Let's go. -Seo-woo, did you have fun today? -Yes. -That was fun. This way. Let's eat it later. Let's go home. Is Seo-woo that odd? I was wondering if she's that different from Ha-jun. It's okay. I don't think she knows. She'd never imagine that I've come back to life. Hyeon-jeong, I'll get going. -Don't give her more than two bottles. -They look too much alike, from head to toes. How can they look exactly the same? Well... Min-jeong, what are you-- Look. They're different sizes, but they look exactly the same. They aren't even twins though. Oh, the shrimps. You mean the shrimps. Right. They probably look the same to us. But they probably all look different if we look carefully. Right, the shrimps. Is Seo-woo that precious to you? Sure. She's adorable. and she's sweet. Then... you can be Seo-woo's mom. She's drunk, right? Yes. She drank more than she could handle. What... happened? You don't have to give her strawberries. It's all right. -But these are very delicious. -It's okay. Ms. Cha, Seo-woo can't have strawberries. She's allergic -She can't have it. -Allergic? Goodness, I'm so sorry. I didn't know. Did you beat me? No. What? What happened to your face? Don't you know? Me? No, I don't. I slept here last night. What did you do? What happened? I don't remember. What? Are you okay? Doesn't that hurt? What's this stench? Did you drink? I'm so upset. Look at your face. What happened last night? You don't need to know. It's just a nosebleed. It's no big deal. How is this not a big deal? My Hyeon-jeong got a nosebleed! Oh, you. That means the other person might not be alive! Now I'll have to work my butt off to pay the settlement money. Old habits never die. You and your fistfights. Hey. I got hit. Exactly. You got hit. That never usually happens. Did you let her go after you got hit? Right. I shouldn't have let her live. Ha-jun, close your eyes. Okay. Ha-jun, open your eyes. Fistfights? I can't quit because of you! That must hurt and this must be excruciating! Ha-jun, you can open your eyes now. Let's go to daycare. Daddy is fine. He won't cry. Let's go. It hurts. Gosh. Goodness. You wretched bastard. What are you looking at, sir? -Hey! -You're such a jerk! -How dare you? -You son of a... You took our offerings too! You can't give unfair preferential treatments! What did Yu-ri say to become human? Jerk. Bastard. She called him all the names in this world. -You can't do this to us! -What a bastard! -You're a mean punk! -Wretched man! -You son of a... -You should die! -Don't be like that! -What a jerk! -Just die! -You're the worst! -Wretched punk! -You're worthless! They'll be punished by Heaven if they provoke him like that. -Son of a... -What? -Goodness! -No! Goodness. I don't think cursing at him will make them human. Mi-ja. Yes, sir. Were you looking for me? If Ms. Mi-dong gets here, stall her. Gosh. What? Are you going to fight me? What's this? Do you hear the ghosts sing? The song of angry ghosts? It is the music of the ghosts Who will not be slaves again! When the beating of your heart Echoes like the beating of the drums Tomorrow will open And I will become human Do you hear the ghosts sing? The song of angry ghosts? It is the music of the ghosts Who will not be slaves again! When the beating of your heart Echoes like the beating of the drums Tomorrow will open And I will become human What do you think you guys are doing? It's a fight. -Fight! -Fight! -What? -Article 1, Clause 1 of the Constitution. The ghost world is a democratic republic. Sovereignty resides with the ghosts. With ghosts! And all ghosts are created equal. But you fancy only Yu-ri. Only Yu-ri! He means favor, not fancy. -What? -Favor. Fancy means... Forget it. No, that doesn't matter. It makes no sense that only Yu-ri became a human! We can't take this anymore. So we are going to protest. -It's a protest. -It's a protest. A protest, my foot. You guys lost your mind and cursed the deities out. I bet you can't wait to go up there. -Where are my bells? Where are they? -My gosh. Where did they go? Don't get cold feet. She can't send us up there. -What? -Really? -I knew it. -Come on. -Go ahead. -Damn it. You... How much did I drink? I even blacked out. Is Seo-woo that precious to you? Sure. She's adorable. and she's sweet. Then... you can be Seo-woo's mom. I'm sure I said something. What on earth did I say? Hello, Seo-woo. Are you feeling okay? Well... Yes. By the way, your nose... I fell off the bed this morning. I see. Well... Let's go. We should get going. Go. I guess you're going somewhere. Yes. What happened to the three of them? Did they have a fight or what? No, they are on the same side. -What? -What? They all have the same Band-Aid. That's sharp. I think there's something going on. -Hello, Seo-woo. -Hello. Take off your shoes. Well done. Let's go. Can you take off your shoes yourself? -Hello. -Hello. Hello. Bye, Ha-jun. Say bye to your mom. -Bye. -See you later. -Bye. -Bye. See you. Let's go. You're so heavy. Hyeon-jeong. We're going for coffee. Let's talk about the kindergarten and the kids with problems together. I have a lot of problems. I have no time to talk about kids with problems. Oh, right. If you have some time, why don't you talk about your own problems? Let's go, Min-jeong. Okay. -I can't take this anymore. -Let it go. Let go of me. I'm going home. Really? They are so peculiar. What kind of problems would five-year-old kids have? It's the adults who created the problems, right? I agree. The adults create problems. Kids who have problems, who are strange, and who start talking late. That's not what I meant. They are no big deal, but adults think they are problems. I see. By the way, did I make any mistakes last night? The last thing I remember is being in your restaurant. No. You just enjoyed your food and left. -Oh, well... -Why? Nothing. No reason. I knew it. We didn't get anywhere. I can't believe this. Has Ms. Mi-dong always been this cruel? Look what you've done. This is all your fault. We didn't know Ms. Mi-dong would do this to us. You all agreed to do this. Why are blame us? Gosh, it feels so stuffy in here. I should go to see my grandson today. What do I do? He's having a talent show. LEE GANG-HO -Welcome. -Hello. Hello, please come on in. CHILDREN'S TALENTS Look at the drawings over here. They the kids' drawings. SUNSHINE CLASS Gosh, look at this. What's that? What's the name? Picasso. It looks like Picasso's painting. Look at the color combination. There's something profound here. I guess the kid is a genius. CHO SEO-WOO, SUNSHINE CLASS Attention, please. -Yes. -Yes. If a stranger offers you a snack and asks you to go with him, what will you say? -No, I don't want to. -No, I don't want to. -Please help. -Please help. What if he tries to take you with him? -No, I don't want to. -No, I don't want to. -Please help. -Please help. All right. Let's say this man is a bad guy. Can you do this as you have practiced? -Yes. -Yes. What is this? Are you done making lunch? Yes. You know what, Ms. Kim? All famous painters drew just like this when they were young. CHO SEO-WOO, SUNSHINE CLASS Is she a genius? HYEON-JEONG Come with me. Now. No. I don't want to. Please help. Well done. Give him a big hand. Here you are. All right. Seo-woo, do you want to go next? ABDUCTION PREVENTION PROGRAM Come here. Come with me. Sir, you're not supposed to smile. Oh, okay. Come here. Follow me. All right. Seo-woo, you shouldn't do that. You should say no. No. Where are you going? -Seo-woo. -Ma'am. You can stay here. I'll go get her. Come over here, kid. Come here. Now. Come on. Come here. Seo-woo, what are you doing here? -Let's go back to your friends. -Good girl. All right. ABDUCTION PREVENTION PROGRAM How strange. She's so strange. Where's your dad? Dad? Why would you ask me that? He's not answering my calls. Where did he go? He's not a kid. I guess he went out to do some business. My gosh. Suspicious movement detected. Need to come come right away. YEON-JI Is this for me? All right. Well done. All right. I'm telling you. I'm going to be a grandpa. Right, my first daughter. Who else would it be? How many calls are you making? Being a grandpa is nothing to brag about. Of course, it is. Do you know why he didn't go to the school reunion lately? -Why? -Why is that, Mother? Everyone shows him pictures of their grandchildren. He couldn't join them because he didn't have one. He only gets jealous. Why would he want to see photos of someone else's grandchildren? All right. I'll buy you a drink soon. Just wait for my call. Yeon-ji, get me some strawberries. Yeon-ji, why are you eating them? They are for your sister. Come on and help your mom. Yu-ri, all you need to do is give birth. I'll take care of your kid. -Really? -Sure. What? You should've done that when we raised our children. I was busy working to support my family. And my grandchild isn't like my children. Anyway, I will take care of everything as a grandpa, okay? -Father. -What? -Can I record that? -Sure. I'll take care of everything as a grandpa, okay? Why would I raise your child? She's right. She's worried that you'd try to take your own life again. You need Seo-woo. You won't survive otherwise. Well done. All right. Let's play with this now. Come here. Slow down. -Let's do it again. -Seo-woo is adorable, isn't she? She's just like my daughter as a kid. Okay. Let's put this on here. Pull it down. Like this. All right. Did you have to dress up like this on a day like this? You told me to wear a suit. I told you to wear a suit. I didn't tell you to dress up like this. The disciplinary committee can't make favorable arrangements if you don't look pitiful and pathetic. If things work that way, what's the good of having a prison? You've always looked so shabby. You should've worn the same thing. Dr. Cho. Dr. Jang has been looking for you today. Really? I guess I will see him someday. HOSPITAL DIRECTOR PARK HYEON-SU He will see a psychiatrist and get treatment. About 90% of a thoracic surgeon's work is surgery. Why do we need a doctor who can't perform surgeries here? Please wait a little more. Dr. Cho was the best thoracic surgeon in our hospital. He will get his second wind soon once he gets treatment. I don't care anymore. We will abide by the decision of the disciplinary committee. -Director Park. -It's not that I don't understand why you are being like this. I know it could be traumatic for him. However, it's unacceptable that a doctor can't perform surgeries. I would've felt the same if I were him. So why did Yu-ri get a job at the kindergarten? I saw Yu-ri and Min-jeong there yesterday. Hyeon-jeong and I almost got a heart attack. She just came back to life, why does she want to work there? What's up with her? Are you sure you're a psychiatrist? Quit it, you fool. What did you say? Hello, Dr. Jang. DR. JANG IS SO ANNOYING You wait outside. Yes, sir. Please move over. I need to get out. Thank you. I was going to do it right from now on. It was just a joke. Well... I mean... I've been out of my mind recently. You can't imagine what's going on with me now. Choose one or the other. About five years ago. Raise a question about it to get me fired. Or keep acting ridiculous to get yourself fired. You have to do one of the two to feel better. Gosh, why would you bring that up again? Why! Why did you do this to me? What should I do now? What am I supposed to do? I'll get treatment. I can do this. Come in and treat him. -Yes, sir. -I'm not talking to you. Okay. Excuse me. There's no way you can get treated by him. Behave yourself at the disciplinary committee unless you want to get fired. And what's with your hair? You have to look pathetic and pitiful. Why are you doing this? -I told you. -What? -Good. -Shut up. This is crazy. Definitely crazy. Who threw away money on the street like this? It's 50,000 won. They all are money. They are 50,000 won bills. This is amazing. They all are money. Money! Min-jeong. Hey, you're here. Can you help me return to work? -Return to work? -Yes. Not at this hospital. I want to go somewhere else. Well, I can look into it. But isn't your kid too young? Is it going to be okay? Yes. It will be fine. Your husband works here. It'd be easier to work here, but why? I see. Because he's being disciplined? I understand. He might get fired. We will find it out after today. I guess there will be the disciplinary committee today. Did you not know that? What? Where's the Oh Min-jeong who'd drop everything and come running for him. I don't know. Maybe she's dead. I bet you two had a fight. A quarrel between husband and wife is just a quarrel. It's not like you'll get a divorce. Yes. I will get a divorce. One more time. One, two, and three. Ms. Mi-dong! No. Just give up. We did something we shouldn't have done. We all cursed her out. But why are we getting punished when Yu-ri got awarded? Do we have to stay in here until someone shows up? JANG YEONG-SIM -My gosh. -What? What happened? Is someone out? Yes. We're out here. The talisman just fell off. Then you should do something for us. What? We should? -Okay. -All right. I'm on it. -Darn it. -You can't touch it. Damn it! Wait here. We will bring someone. -Let's go. -Okay. Wait here. We'll be right back. Hey, Mr. Ma. Excuse me. Dad, it's not going to work on him. -Shall we go to Ms. Mi-dong? -She will put us back in. Oh, right. Hey, Seo-woo. We will have fun again next time. Make sure not to skip meals. Bye. If Mom finds out about this, she won't like it. What are they doing here again? If you keep being like this, we will haunt your daughter. I can't believe this. Gosh, I'm still not sure. I mean, even ghosts have some ethics. This is the only way we can lure Yu-ri out. I guess that's true. Gosh, okay. You take care of it. Dad, this isn't time to feel guilty. We have to survive. Then... Hey! Come here. -How dare you do this to a little kid? -Get out of here. -Get lost. -Go far away. Get out and don't come back. Why? Did you think we'd try to harm your daughter or something? It's true we were under pressure, but what do you take us for? That's what it looked like. You guys did threaten me too. I had reason to be suspicious. What's the point of sticking together for five years? -You still can't trust us. -Exactly. Fine, I'm sorry. That's why I'm here. What's all this? Gosh, is this how Ms. Mi-dong gets when she's angry? What did you guys say to the deities? Some words I can't repeat. And we did it as a group. I beg you to forgive those ignorant ghosts. I've punished them severely, so please have mercy on them. Gosh, should I just send those idiots up? I take it back. Please have mercy on them. Aren't you guys afraid of being summoned without a notice? That's what I was going for, but you guys want to remain here as ghosts, don't you? -Of course, we do. -We had to try. We can come back to life if we can go back to where we were. And I think I can do that. You killed yourself. I can't take my place back. The deities know that well. All right. Then, can you at least do us favors? -That's a great idea. -Please do us favors. Fine, tell me. What do you want me to do? Please tell my son to replace my portrait next to my urn. It's from when I got married. -It's too old. -I want my portrait to be replaced too. I want one from when I was on my previous team. My new uniform sucks. It doesn't fit me well either. -Please deliver my ledgers to my mom. -I want new music in the cinerarium. I'm getting sick of it after hearing it every single day. -I want alcohol! -I want fried chicken! Stop! Are you asking me to spend my 49 days doing you favors? That's crazy. I can't do this. -Wait! -Where are you going? You, of all people, can't do this to us. No one understands us better than you do. You're our only hope. You know how we feel. No, sweetheart. What should I do? Yeong-hye. Oh, no. I don't know what to do. What should I do? COMPANY EDGE CAUSED A HOPEFUL YOUNG WOMAN TO DIE CLOSED FOR HOLIDAYS, OPEN AGAIN IN 3 DAYS Forget it. There are no ghosts who have no regrets, but you must have forgotten everything in just a few days. I'm disappointed. You hurt me. Who says I've forgotten? I remember all of it. Fine, I'll do each of you one favor. -Really? -Are you sure? -Now you're talking. -Yes! Calm down. Please speak one at a time. Granny, you want new music? Hold on. That's not what I want! Do you want a new portrait? You want chicken and alcohol? Where are your ledgers? I'll deliver them. -You want a new portrait too? -I just said whatever. So what do you want? I can do it for you. -Give us a second. -Let me think. -What should I ask for? -This is hard. -What can she do for me? -Let's see. Gosh, I knew this would happen. That's why I told you not to get caught. You're too nice. Thank you. I can never do them any favors. Being a shaman is a curse. I know all their stories but I'm not allowed to get involved. -But I still feel bad. -Gosh, you're too nice. What did you say? My gosh. You don't even have to tell me what kind of things they asked you to do. Granny, what are you going to ask her to do? Have you decided? Gosh. Why do you keep calling me that? What about you? Me? I was thinking of asking her to deliver a message to my son, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea to remind him of me when he's finally forgotten about me. I'm sure none of the things are for themselves. Isn't it easy for you? You just need your ledgers to be delivered to your mom. -You've been saying it all the time. -Gosh, seriously. Leave me alone. Go away. My mom thinks I was a civil servant. -What? -Gosh. The reason why they're lingering here is their children and parents. What about you? After taking your own life, why are you still here? Is there even anything you want? Just because I killed myself doesn't mean I have no regrets. A funeral for baseball player Gang Bin was held a few days ago. Many friends and colleagues came and paid their respects. Team owner Lee Jeong-hee and coach Park Hyeon-seok were filled with grief. His close friends including singer-turned-actress An Hyeon-sook, -female singers Im Bo-reum and... -My goodness. -...male singers... -A person died, and all they care about is who attended your funeral and who didn't? Man, I sure don't envy celebrities. ...attended his funeral. They only realized what matters in life after they died. Promise me you won't say anything unnecessary. Like what? Don't say whatever comes to your mind. Just say you're sorry and promise you'll be treated. Beg for forgiveness! -"Beg"? -Yes. -How? -Desperately. Show me. Get down on your knees or something. "Please forgive me this once." You're good. It's not my style. Come here. You haven't performed any surgery for four years. That's right. You should have reported your condition and received treatment. What kind of doctor runs away during a laparotomy? Am I wrong? You're right. I see your wife passed away at our hospital. The documents here say your condition was caused by her death. I'm not sure if it justifies you not being able to perform surgery. You're still a doctor, aren't you? Yes. Does that mean you will follow our decision? Yes. If you have nothing more to add, you may leave now. That went pretty well. Is there anything you want to say? Isn't a doctor a person? A doctor declares more than a dozen deaths on any given day. After a while, it doesn't mean much anymore. It's just another unfortunate death, that's all. Yes, that is our job. But have you ever imagined that the person dying unfortunately on the operating table could be your wife? Have you ever imagined it could be your mother, father, or child? "You're still a doctor." But isn't a doctor is a person too? Welcome. You idiot. Gang-hwa, pull yourself together, will you? When are you going to stop being like this? Pull yourself together! Dr. Jang. It's you. Here. Gosh, stop being so angry. Please. Stop being so angry. How could I ever pull myself together? I don't have the right to. She died because of me. I killed her. I did. I killed her. Bring Yu-ri back. Bring her back. Bring her back, you jerk. There's no way I can pull myself together. One iced Americano, please. Mommy got hurt. Blow on it, Ha-jun. Thank you. How does Yu-ri know how much Min-jeong can drink? A divorce? Apparently, she is seeing divorce lawyers to get consulted. -Oh, my. -The thing is, she even went to my brother-in-law's law firm. That's how I heard about it. See? I told you. -Being a stepmom isn't easy. -It isn't. What's going to happen to Seo-woo now? I feel sorry for her. I know. I was right. She married Seo-woo's dad for his money. Now I understand why she's been sending Seo-woo to so many academies. -Could she be seeing a guy? -Oh, my. You're so smart. -Gosh! -Gosh, you startled me. Do you have so much time? So have you found any of your own problems? I wouldn't believe you've had enough time to find all of them. Cut it out and be on your way. You're the one who didn't want to have coffee with us. If you spread groundless rumors in a public place, you may face charges. Did your brother-in-law never mention that? What's the big deal? We were only talking to each other. You think kids have no idea, but they do. They repeat what they hear at the kindergarten. How dare you even mention names in front of the kids? Maybe I should bring charges. It's not like I made anything up. It's a fact. Seo-woo's mom has even written up divorce papers. As Seo-woo's friends' moms, we were only discussing what we can do for Seo-woo. My goodness. I don't know what to say. Let's go, Ha-jun. Come here, sweetie. Hyeon-jeong, are you listening? What? I'm sorry. What were you saying? Ha-jun cried today when he saw a cut of hairtail. Saying he felt sorry for the hairtail, he made such a fuss. Really? Yu-ri. What? Are you really okay with seeing Seo-woo only at the kindergarten? You don't want to raise her yourself? No. I'm happy this way. Why do you keep asking? I already told you. You're keeping a distance from Gang-hwa because of Min-jeong. You can't do anything because Gang-hwa is with Min-jeong. Hyeon-jeong. Yes? I don't belong there anymore. It's where Min-jeong should be. Seo-woo, you've gotten a lot better. We just have to come back here a few more times. Thank you. I don't know anymore. What should I do with those two? Min-jeong is preparing for a divorce. She wants to divorce Gang-hwa. Are you sure you don't want to go back to where you were? Toughen up a little. Forget it. I don't want to ruin their happiness. They may not be living too great of a life. What if their marriage is rotten on the inside? It's 50,000 won. That's right. It's a 50,000-won bill. -Gosh, that hurts. -It's money. -Come on. Please... -It's money. Unbelievable. -It's money! -Catch her. Run! -Min-jeong! -It's money! Wait, Min-jeong! Min-jeong! -Min-jeong! -It's money! -Min-jeong! -Min-jeong! Be careful! -Oh, my. -Oh, no! -Are you okay? -Are you okay? My goodness. Why did you run? -I'm okay. -Gosh. I'm fine. -Bye. -Wait. Wait, Min-jeong! -Wait! -Wait, Min-jeong! -Stop! -Wait! Stop there! Gosh! -My goodness. -Unbelievable. She's completely out of control. She's usually not like that. What's with her today? She can't drink more than a bottle. -Really? -I'm out of breath. -Where are you going? -Stop her! Good. I can't run anymore. I can't. Gosh. Are you okay? -Are you okay? -I'm burning up. I'm scared. Your face... scares me. Yu-ri! Are you okay? Gosh, that hurts. That really hurts! Then... you can be Seo-woo's mom. Can I do it? I don't know what I'm living for. Home, work, home, work... I want to live a little. At least you're single. My wife drives me crazy. She can't stop nagging me. I want to go on a vacation to a deserted island alone. My mom is such a nag too, so I'm moving out. She drives me crazy! I guess it's not a good idea for a woman in her 30s to live with her mom. Those ungrateful bastards. I know. Be nice to your family while you still can, you idiots! You will regret everything later! It took me only one second to regret my decision to kill myself. When you're about to die, they say your life flashes before your eyes, right? Bullshit. All I could think of was this one sentence. "Gosh, what's going to happen to Pil-seung now?" -What are you doing? -Why are you taking it away? Darn it! -Gosh, what a waste! -We're not finished yet! Even in the face of death, there's something that doesn't let you only think about yourself. It's family. Yu-ri or Min-jeong? Is it like, "Choose Mom or Dad?" I choose Yu-ri. Definitely. My dead friend came back to life. Everyone has a friend who came back to life. You want to be her pick-up helper? To scare away the ghost? What can I do? I'm the only one who can protect Seo-woo. Do you like that lady? I like the pretty lady. He's living with his wife. Yu-ri can't be there. What kind of lunatic would say yes to that? No way. Can I do it? I have to.
