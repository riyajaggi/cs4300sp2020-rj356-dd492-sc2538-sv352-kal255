 He can be a doctor his whole life, but he will never get used to his patients dying. Besides, he treated this patient for a long time. Gang-hwa must be having a hard time.

 You're supposed to come and hug me, idiot. How long have you been following me? Let's see. Since the hospital? -Are you a stalker? -A stalker? There was a time when I could light him up when things were dark for him. So he wouldn't wander around in the darkness for long. So he wouldn't be in despair. Watching your loved one lose the light of his life. Someone needs to shine a light for him because he's wandering in the dark, but that person can't be me anymore. When I realized that, I was in despair. You should eat something solid.

 -Ma'am, two bowls of noodles, please. -Okay. I can't be seen eating alone here, by myself this late at night. Don't you want to eat with me? What? Okay. But I don't want any food. -Ma'am, instead of two bowls-- -Wait. That's... Both of them are for me. -Just give us two bowls of noodles. -Okay. Did you skip meals for a few days? Take your time with that. The portions here are small, so everyone eats two bowls. I see. Hey, this is a lot. Jeez. I saw that coming. Here. Is it good? This is my first meal of the day. I didn't have any food. I see. Do you want some? And he started to light up again. EPISODE 9: GOODBYE AND HELLO TO YOUR LIGHT ABDUCTION PREVENTION PROGRAM How many times do I have to tell you we can't show up in front of her? Do you think this is easy for me? I miss them so much... that it tears my heart out! Hyeon-jeong. All I want... is for Gang-hwa not to cry. That's all I want. Yu-ri. Okay. Yu-ri, I understand. Ms. Jeon. Mom. HYEON-JEONG Yes, Hyeon-jeong. Why do you keep... What? Okay. I'm on my way now. Where are you going? I just got a call from the hospital. -At this hour? -Yes. Sorry. Go to sleep without me. She's fine. She just hyperventilated for a moment. She'll be fine. What should we do? Mom has a weak heart. The grieving period for parents is three years as well. I believe it is time for you to let her go. I only fed her good food. I only gave her good clothes when I raised her. There was so much I could do for her. But is letting her go the only thing I can do for her now? Death is the law of this world. That is one nasty law. I had her in me for ten months and raised her for thirty years. How can I let her go in three years? When I think about her, my heart still melts in pain. I miss her. Just once. I want to see her just once more. I desperately want to see my daughter. Take the X-ray again and call Radiology. -I'm all right. -Ms. Jeon. You know, I saw someone. It was... Is that really you, Yu-ri? Mom! Goodness. It really is you, Yu-ri! My gosh. Yu-ri. -Mom. -Yu-ri. Yu-ri. Mom, I've missed you. Mom. Where's the patient, Jeon Eun-suk? Over there. Mom. My daughter. My gosh. I couldn't stop crying. They should have reunited from the get-go. It was bound to happen. Was she going to hide forever? You cried too, right? Hyeon-jeong. Why do you keep crying? Hyeon-jeong. What's wrong? Yu-ri reunited with her parents. It all worked out. Don't cry. She can get her life back one day at a time now. What about Seo-woo? What about Gang-hwa? They were... Yu-ri's family first. Yu-ri belongs with them. Well... I mean... that's... Baby steps. She'll take baby steps and sort it out one day at time. She won't do it. She doesn't want her life back. She just... Just... Hyeon-jeong. Did something happen with Yu-ri? Gang-hwa loves her, doesn't he? You know that. What would be more important than that? Gosh, don't cry. Come here. Don't cry now. -Hey, you're back. -Yes. I'm sorry. Sleep. Mom. Yes? Mom. Yes. Can you see me? Can you hear me? Yes. I can see you. I can hear you, too. Mom. Eun-suk. Can you please look at me? Your daughter is right here. Yu-ri? She's right here. Okay. Where's Yu-ri? I'm holding on tight to her, so she can't leave. Okay. Hey, scoot over. Let me hug her, too. -Hey. -My gosh. You should get off the bed. -Goodness. -My gosh, it hurts. -Oh, no. -Dad. -My gosh. -That was loud. Are you okay? Gosh, you're so cruel! Oh, my. There you go again. Jeez. -Let me join you. -Gosh. -Come on. Get off the bed. -Hey! You're so strong. With the installed camera, it goes around the vast farmland. -In order to evaluate how ripe... -Mr. Ma. Mr. Ma! Mr. Ma. I'm about to die of boredom. Can you put on a TV show that is actually fun? Mr. Ma, switch the channel to Comedy Big League. Mr. Ma. Dad. He's falling back to sleep. Damn it. Come on. What's so fun about the news? Why does he keep watching it? That's what I'm talking about! The news is useless to us, but he keeps putting on the news all day. Here's your next news. The death of the late baseball player, Kang Bin, has resurfaced recently. He was being investigated for the match-fixing scandal. And he ended his own life as an attempt to prove his innocence. He didn't have a lot on his mind. He didn't think much... I mean, he was positive and cheerful to be around. Well, they said they found a suicide note. That's heartbreaking. He was under investigation, so he had a hard time with that. But he wasn't the type to end his life. What? What is it? He tested normal both for depression and bipolar disorder. As for the mental state the patient was in, I assessed that he was stable enough not to make such a decision. So I did not prescribe any medication. I thought you committed suicide. -Pardon? -He didn't show any signs... Yes. You must've been rash after you got drunk, right? That's what I remember. Yes. Seriously? Wouldn't you have to be depressed to commit suicide even if you were intoxicated? Come on. We've seen a lot of ghosts who committed suicide. What's his deal? What? What is it? I killed myself. Forget about that. Are you really gay? Is that true? -I'm more curious about that. -Why? People are always curious about rumors, you know. Rumors about being gay, dating, or getting divorced. And rumors about suicide. I guess that was a rumor, too. So are you gay? My gosh. Why aren't you telling me? Is it such a big secret? GLASS CRAFTS CERTIFICATE CHA YU-RI MARCH 13TH, 2011 BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS ON THE STREET They should've thrown all this away. Yu-ri. What is it, Mom? I was wondering where you were. Mom. Yes, what is it? Well, I want to eat some fern brake. Really? All right, I'll go buy some and make it for you right away. Oh, no. I'm late! CHO GANG-HWA PATIENT: JEON EUN-SUK -Thoracic surgery? -Yes. I heard it's really tough. The doctors barely get any sleep. You should choose an easier one. Is it because of my mom? It's best to have a doctor do regular checks on the heart. I'll take care of your mom from now on. There's nothing else I want to do anyway. -Make sure to take your meds. -Right. Thank you. All right. Take care. Okay, let's see... -Hey. -Let me see. No. She said she'd go to another hospital if I keep showing you. Just don't tell her, then. Are these all the meds she's getting? Yes, she's better so I reduced them. Take another CT scan just in case and show me. All right. But she really is incredible. She's not letting you treat her so you can get remarried. -All right. Thanks. -Right. Bye. DOCTOR: CHO GANG-HWA Is she gone? -Yu-ri! -She's not gone. She's coming back. Mom, Dad. I have lots of things to do, so I'll be back in the evening. You should've kept her here. She left while I was taking a shower. But Honey... Are we dreaming? I've been pinching my cheeks over and over since last night. We're not dreaming. Right. This isn't a dream. But... What about Seo-woo? I don't think it would be good for Gang-hwa, but I want our daughter to see her own kid. She might not be saying anything, but I'm sure she's curious. And she'll want to see Seo-woo. Seo-woo! Should we take off your shoes? All right. Here you go. Seo-woo, come here. -I'll take that. -Okay. -Bye, Ms. Oh. -Right. Let's go. Take good care of her for me. Of course. I'll be home around dinnertime, so I'll see you then. Okay. Well, then... -Hang on. -Yes? Just a minute. Drink these. -Both of them? -Giving just one seems cold. I don't like canned coffee. I only drink Americanos. No, I know you love those. How would you know that? Well... I can just tell. Your face says that you like sweets. How would I know? I saw her drink that every day. She had boxes of canned coffee. Americano, my foot. She hardly knows me. How would she know? -Is that so? -Yes. Ms. Oh! I guess you just brought Seo-woo here. Yes. Bye, then. Why is she so cold? Come on. Let's just go. Anyway, I heard that the kitchen assistant follows Seo-woo around everywhere. Why, though? Why only Seo-woo? I don't know. Don't Seo-woo and that kitchen assistant look alike? What? -Well, I saw her playing with Seo-woo... -And? ...and they both have huge eyes. They really look similar. Is he still not coming out? No. He's never been criticized in his whole life. I guess he was really shocked. You've been bullied your whole life while taking care of him. Just leave him here and go by yourself. And I heard it was because you were overworked. We've been together for a long time. He didn't always just criticize me. He may talk harshly, but he's a good man. I doubt that. If it weren't for Mr. Baek, my daughter couldn't have had a decent life. What do you mean? EMERGENCY CENTER Please, come treat my girl! -This way. -Okay. Don't cry. -It was hot water... -What happened? -It was hot water. -Get disinfectant! Twenty million won? How could we get such a huge sum? Her whole leg has third-degree burns. If she doesn't get surgery... she'll keep living in that state. Please, I promise I'll pay you back. I promise. Hello? Please... Please help us out. Hye-su is just a little girl. Hello? Are you there? Honey, how did it go? Hye-su... Let's go home. I'll... order you some jjajangmyeon. All right. Let's go. Let's go home. Where are you taking her? We're getting the operation room ready. What? Well, we don't have the money... We received the surgery fee. The sender's name was Baek Sam-dong. What? Mr. Baek... Honey! Is that so? Thank you! That jerk really did such a thing? That sum may have been nothing to Mr. Baek, but he's a savior to me. I was born a human, but if I forget things I should be grateful for, I won't be a human anymore. I guess you're right. Even if he seems rude to us, you two must have gone through a lot together. I guess you should take him with you, then. Right? My goodness. Hyeon-jeong cried? Yes. She said you and Seo-woo are Yu-ri's. She's not someone to say such things. Doesn't it seem strange? I guess something did happen yesterday. What are you doing? It's so annoying. Gosh, this won't do. Hey, take some photos for me. You know. Just the body below my head. I've been so preoccupied with you and Yu-ri these days that I didn't get to upload my photos. That's enough. These are good. But look at this guy. Gang-hwa. Look. It took so long to get all these followers, but it only took him two months. Do you think that makes sense? -Yes, it does. -Damn it. I've seen things that really don't make sense. Anyway, so I was going to upload this when I got about 200 thousand followers, but... The guy with a sexy brain. Intelligence is what completes fashion, you know. Even if you buy expensive limited editions, you can't match a man's sexy intelligence. "O. O. T. D. It's a bit embarrassing, but I'm revealing this now." -You're embarrassing me. -"My daily outfit." You're so embarrassing. All right. I think I'll get up to... about 300 thousand followers today. I am now really showing off. All right. -Geun-sang. -Yes? -I wasn't sure about this... -Yes? But now I'm sure that you're crazy. All my doubts just disappeared. You have no right to call me crazy. Doesn't Yu-ri start working today? You should go home as late as you can. -Go after Yu-ri leaves. -Of course. But why would Min-jeong hire a pick-up helper? Was it tough for her? She said she's going to start work again. Right. She didn't work for a while. I guess she'd want to work. -Right. -What will you do about Yu-ri? She's met her family now. You should do something. She just met her parents. What could I do about it? I guess you're right. What could you possibly do? Gang-hwa, wait for me! Wait up! Hey, that's the interview I did yesterday. What do you think? You look like a madman who's doing an interview. Oh, my gosh! What's wrong with him? -He's a judge. -What are you doing? #DAILY OUTFIT #HANDSOME Gang-hwa, he's a judge. You're crazy. Why does he have to be a judge? Shouldn't a judge be busy judging? Isn't he working? YOU HAVE A NEW COMMENT I found the psychiatrist quack! You're that doctor who killed Bin, right? What's all this? You said he wasn't someone who'd kill himself. But he did! -He was always slacking off. -You murderer! Let's go and teach him a lesson. Bring back our Bin! What is this? The person you are calling is unavailable right now. Please try again later. My gosh, Cha Yu-ri... What are you thinking about? You didn't even notice me. Well, just this and that. Are you heading somewhere? I'm like a job-seeker these days. I'm trying to start work again. Oh, you are? I hope it works out well for you. You know... The young kitchen assistant... Are you close with her? Yes, we're close. Very close. She's going to be Seo-woo's pick-up helper, so I'm curious. You were close with Seo-woo's biological mom too, right? She just looks... a lot like her. Well, then. Thank you for this. The assistant gave me that. I wanted to share it. HYEON-JEONG Oh, right. The red beans. Where are they? Seo-woo. A pick-up helper is coming for you, starting today. Seo-woo, shall we go? Her mother said a pick-up helper would come for her. That's me. The pick-up helper. Let's go, Seo-woo. She kind of seems like Seo-woo's stalker now. Don't you think? My goodness. -Thank you. -Enjoy. Ta-da! Seo-woo, what is this? It's a carp! It looks so tasty, doesn't it? Good girl. You're so adorable. Is it good? Your kid looks just like you. Pardon? She's so pretty. Her facial features are all exactly the same as yours. Seo-woo. Can you see that man standing over there? Yes, the man with the hat. I guess she can still see them because of the ghost at home. I'm sorry. I'll make sure you stop seeing things like that. I'll get rid of that jerk. Let's go home now. What is it, Seo-woo? We should go home. CARP BREAD Please take Seo-woo to her English academy at three. Right. She should learn English. She shouldn't fall behind in the global society. Hey, Seo-woo. Seo-woo. -Thank you. -Bye. Did you do well? Let's go home now. Take her to the piano academy at 4:30. Right. She should learn the piano. She might be slow at talking, but she might be a musical genius. That's right! She may become the next Schubert. She's done. Seo-woo, let's go. Again? When can we go home? Are you done, Seo-woo? What is this? Are you giving this to me? Yes. It's you, pretty Auntie. Thank you. Thank you, Seo-woo. BAEK SAM-DONG Hey... Sam-dong. Baek Sam-dong. Baek Sam-dong! -Are you mad? -Oh, my gosh. Mr. Baek, you're here. You don't have anything left in the human world now. Just come with me. Don't be ridiculous. That might be the case for you, but not me. You lived your life doing and having whatever you wanted. Do you still have lingering desires? Just because I did everything I wanted to do... doesn't mean I have no lingering desires. There were so many things that didn't go as I wanted. So give me the shares that you stole from me! How dare you talk like that to me! I took care of everything while you were studying abroad. Why would I give all that hard work away? I earned it all. What did you just say? Take it. What? Right. I'm sorry, sir. -Hello? -Where are you, Dad? Why aren't you home yet? Sorry, I'm going to be a bit late today. Where are you? You might miss the last bus. Should we come pick you up? No, it's fine. I promise I'll take a cab home. Don't worry. Okay. Oh, right. Bring chicken on your way home! All right. I should go now. Bye. Do you know why I bullied you? I was jealous. I know. I've known you for a long time, you know. Everything I left behind was just useless trash. Everyone is fighting over the money I left behind, and my kids are growing up as terrible people, gaining things with the honor I left behind. All I left in this world is trash. Why would you think that? You helped my daughter Hye-su get a better leg. I mustn't break the egg you gave me, so I'll be careful and take good care of it. But, Seo-woo... Whose is that? Mom! You'll fall. Slow down. Did you draw this at the art academy? How was it today? She had a lot of classes today, so it must've been tiring. A little. It was okay. You can go home now. I'll take her backpack. I still have some time left to work. I'm sure you have to make dinner. I'll go in with you and babysit her while you do that. It's okay. I see. I guess you're okay. Okay. Goodbye, then. I didn't even get to see that ghost. Do you want... a tour of my house? Yes! Let's go, Seo-woo. What are you doing over there? Putting the shoes together. Putting Seo-woo's shoes together, and these shoes. My shoes, too. Good. Looks great. She's Seo-woo's pick-up helper. You know her, right? Yes, of course. I know her well. What? Wait, what? I just know her. Right, I have something to research, so I'll be in my study. Her kindergarten stuff is in her room, and her snacks are in the veranda. Why are you still here, Yu-ri? Why? My gosh, what am I going to do? What am I going to do now? This is driving me insane. Forget it. I'll just stay here. Forget it. Don't go outside. I don't have to go outside. Then everything will be fine. Forget it. It's okay. Let's get some sleep. I'll get some sleep. It'll be fine. Did I look like an idiot just now? No, that was pretty smooth... Not. I'm sure that ghost is still here. I'll get you if I find you. Over there. You bastard. Me? Goodness, fruit flies. There are fruit flies in here. Goodness, these jerks. They cause that thing, you know... Right, atopic disease. We have to catch these jerks. Gosh, thank you. It's winter. There are fruit flies? Darn it, where did it go? -Did she leave? -She did. What are you going to do, man? It really isn't good to see them together at home. Gosh, whatever. I'm starving. You idiot. Just die of starvation, will you? Goodness, I didn't get to do anything before I left. Where is that thing hiding? Seo-woo, let's say goodbye to Ms. Jeon. Say, "See you tomorrow." Goodbye, Seo-woo. See you tomorrow. She has no classes tomorrow. You can play with her in the playground. -I'll babysit her at home. -What? Oh, I mean, it's... The fine dust situation is awful. And kids have weak bronchial tubes. Gosh, even adults get choked up like this. Kids shouldn't be outside these days. It'll be really bad. I've been getting this feeling for a while, but it looks like you adore her more than I do. What? Is Seo-woo that precious to you? Then... You can be Seo-woo's mom. The director said you only follow Seo-woo around at the kindergarten, too. Right, that's... She's just that adorable. I'm sorry. You don't have to apologize. Thank you... for cherishing her. Goodbye. Let's go home, Seo-woo. Seo-woo's present. Hey, I tried my best to come home as late as possible. But she was still here. What can I do? This isn't good. I'm signing up for night duty. Did you forget? You're still on suspension. My gosh, that darned suspension. All good. It's all good. What are you eating in the midst of this? Are you hungry?-- My goodness! -What is this? -Why? What's going on? No idea. What is this? My gosh, why? Egg... Why is that egg...? Egg... Why is someone throwing eggs at my car? KANG BIN Who are they? Gang-hwa, hang up for a minute. Why are you coming? Why? What is it? Why? What? What is it? Why? What? What? What's with him? What is this? What's going on? Why is this so good? Is it because I am hungry? These were fertile eggs. That's why. These are expensive. Hey, Doctor. Come on out. Let's have a talk, Doctor! What? Why are they doing this? What? What is it? Who are you? You'll get a good scolding from me! -Why? What? -Get out so we can talk! If you did that interview on him, why can't you talk with us? "That interview"? Wait, Kang Bin? -What's with you? -You said he was fine. If he was fine, why did he visit a psychiatrist and kill himself? He didn't do it right, that's why. "Counseling"? If you had done it right, he wouldn't have died! You murderer! -"Murderer"? -Come out! Get out! -My gosh, no! -You murderer! Gosh, please stop. Throw! Keep throwing! What am I going to do? My gosh! Why are you doing this? Goodness, what's going on? My gosh, what are they doing in front of my restaurant? What are they doing? You gave it to me as a present, but I forgot. I'm sorry. You could just pick it up tomorrow. But still, it was Seo-woo's first gift to me. I should take it home. Right? All right, all done. I've peeled it all. Gang-hwa. You! I didn't even get to see that ghost. Do you want... a tour of my house? Yes! Let's go, Seo-woo. Hello, my light. Where does she keep going to? I only have a few days left. I have to make sure she doesn't see them. You're dead. -Are you a shaman, too? -Yes. Peek-a-boo. Stop right there, you brat! Min-jeong likes her because she looks like Yu-ri? Is Min-jeong by any chance a pervert? I'm here... Your wife is Seo-woo's mom, too. Even after you die, your children will always be... -What is it? -...your homework. -Mommy! -I can do it. So let me. Let me be Seo-woo's real mom. Subtitle translation by Won-hyang Son OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
