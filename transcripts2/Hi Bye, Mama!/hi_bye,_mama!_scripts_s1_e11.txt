 -You want to do what? -Do one favor for each other. We might not have time for each other once our baby's born. We should enjoy our newlywed status before it ends. I wasn't joking. Just tell me, and I'll do it for you. -Really? -Of course. Well, then since it's a rare opportunity... I should really put a lot of thought into it. Pick me up on a rainy day. What? That's it? "That's it"? When I was little,

 mothers would come to school with umbrellas on a rainy day. I envied the other kids so much because my mom never came. Why are you telling me such a sad story so suddenly? She had no choice since she was working. All right. I'll do that. Really? You'll do that for me? Of course. That's a piece of cake. I'll go pick you up whenever it rains. You shouldn't say that so casually. It's raining almost like rainy season these days. Are you sure you'll be okay? -Of course. -Okay. Your turn, then. Tell me what you want. I'll give you anything you want. What do you want? I don't really want much.

 Maybe a diamond. One about this size. You've just crossed the line. I enjoyed spending time with you. I hope you live a happy life. It's raining. Honey, it's raining a lot. What about that promise you made? I'm too lazy to go. My gosh. Honey, I feel so heavy today. Can we just skip today? Of course. My husband! You're here. -My wife. -Yes. I thought you were going to pick me up whenever it rained. I really was about to go... but I felt too lazy. Oh, did you? It's fine. You shouldn't come out. You should take care of yourself. Oh, you're so wet. Yes, I'm totally soaked. You're right. You're all soaked. Maybe our Yeol-mu said you should go pick me up, but you... No, I... Back then, each day arrived so naturally that I thought it was obvious for the next day to arrive. You've fed our sleeping baby so many tangerines again? Our baby really likes tangerines. -Honey. -Oh, Honey! -You came to pick me up? -Yes. -Really? Thank you. -Of course. If I had known that the next day wouldn't arrive ever again, I wouldn't have let each precious day just pass by idly. EPISODE 11: THE SHARE OF LIFE GIVEN TO ME I can't believe we ran out of salt. Still, I'd rather go to the supermarket than peel carrots. Definitely. My goodness. Ma'am. Are you okay? Mister! Wake up! Oh, no... Help. Please save my baby. Help. -How long has it been? -She needs treatment right away! Hurry! Excuse me, the grandmother is in a bad state. -Get a surgery room ready! -It's urgent! You should treat the grandma over there! -The grandmother-- -She was just startled. -We should treat this patient-- -No! She's going to die! Ma'am. No... Please. What do I do? What happened? What is it? Gang-hwa, where are you going? -Gang-hwa. -A car accident. Send her to ER. Please take care of this grandmother! You need to treat her first! Please, she's going to die. Gang-hwa. What is it? Are you okay? Yes, I'm fine. But check that grandmother, please. I think she's going to die soon. Do something, please! We have doctors here, so it's going to be okay. No! She's going to die! Gang-hwa, hurry! -Over here! -Yes? Do a chest X-ray and ECG on her -and contact the Cardiology Department. -What? We... -Come on! It's urgent! -Okay! Hurry! Please... -Here. -Oh, thank you. She's okay for now. She'll get surgery as soon as her family arrives. That's a relief. I really thought she might pass away. -How did you know? -What? Know what? Well... Even the doctors didn't realize the state she was in. How did you know? Well, you know... I had a feeling. A feeling? You know how I can often guess things right. You know, that thing you always mentioned... Right, the golden time. You said it's critical not to miss that period. I could feel that it was the golden time. You felt that from a grandmother who wasn't even showing pain? Yes. I should go to work now. You should go, too. I'll be off. Hey, wait... Yu-ri. Yes? What is it? Is your stomach okay? Yes. You should get some honey water. I feel awful. -Oh, my stomach. -Drink up. Come on. You always feel awful whenever you drink. Why can't you stop drinking? Stop nagging me, I'm about to die here. You should just quit drinking, like me. Come on, drink this. I think I'm going to throw up if I drink that. But you should still drink this. You're going to ruin your stomach. I really can't drink anything right now. Come on. Just a little bit. -Just a bit. -Do I really have to? -Yes. Come on. -It's like drinking poison. Poison? Do you really think your husband would do that? -Okay. That's enough. -Drink a bit more. I'm fine. Don't worry. -Yu-ri. -I'm so happy. DISCIPLINARY NOTICE THORACIC SURGEON CHO GANG-HWA LEAVING OPERATION ROOM DURING AN OPERATION WITHOUT NOTICE, NERVOUS DISORDER Gang-hwa. Wait... Hey... Oh, no... This is awful. What is this? Open up. Ms. Mi-dong. You know nothing will be solved by avoiding me. All right. Let's at least talk face-to-face, okay? Let me at least see your face. Who is that man? What is it? Ms. Mi-dong must be dating someone. Oh, my. Someone so young? It's the trend to date young men these days. -Really? -She's doing well for herself. Wait, that man... He's an exorcist! Exorcist? My gosh. What should I do? That poor thing. You know, the civil servant that got rid of all the ghosts in Seoul. You're dead, so you should go up now. Hand in hand with your friends. He just sent up every ghost he saw without giving them a chance. So he has a success rate of 99.9 percent. Since he took over Gangnam, Gangdong, and Gangseo-gu, all the ghosts have been annihilated. But why is he here? -We should run! -Go! Hurry! Are these rubber shoes or what? This place looks like it's from the Joseon Dynasty. Even the shaman in the north would be more elegant than this. What? What is it? Why are you here? What is a successful elite exorcist doing here? Do you really not know? Why would an exorcist with a 99.9 percent success rate be sent to a cinerarium with a zero percent success rate? Why do you think they've sent me? It's not zero percent. I sent up two people a few days ago. Wow, that is so amazing. You sent as many as two people? That's two in ten years. Isn't that right? LEDGER You couldn't even send up a ghost who died from suicide. How can you not even send up those who were trying to... reset their lives? I'm at a loss for words. I'll take care of everything. Take a little break. What are you going to do... with Cha Yu-ri... and Cho Seo-woo? Wait, I'll take care of-- The deities sent a message a long time ago. Are you going to keep ignoring it? No, don't. I'll take care of it. You can't do such a thing. We should have pity on them. Do you still not get it? There isn't a single ghost that isn't pitiful. Wait... Please. CHA YU-RI So I wonder... What if... What if Seo-woo keeps seeing ghosts? What will happen? It's nothing serious. She will be just like me. A shaman? That can't be right. I can't let it happen. This is too harsh. I was a ghost for five years. I don't want anything else. You're a mom. You know how I feel. This is the only thing I can do for Seo-woo, you know. -Wait, Yu-ri. -If you don't stop, I'll go up right now. Gosh, I'm getting a headache. What am I supposed to do? Oh, my gosh. What... Oh, Ms. Jeon. What are you doing there when it's so cold outside? Well, I just needed some fresh air to think. Did you buy groceries? Would you like some coffee? -Why not? It's been a while. -Okay. Thank you. It's been a while since you came here. You didn't come in case you might run into Gang-hwa. That's true... but it was also because I might be reminded of her. I heard Yu-ri is working as a pick-up helper and a kitchen lady at the kindergarten. Did Yu-ri tell you that? No, I heard it from Gang-hwa. I just couldn't talk about this with Yu-ri. She doesn't mention her kid to me either, whether it's intentional or not. Right... She didn't say much to you either, right? Well... She didn't. She came back from the dead, but her husband isn't hers anymore, and the baby she had for ten months isn't hers, either. She got rid of Seo-woo's things in her room. I guess it upset her. But... you're happy, right? I won't have... any regrets even if I die right now. Hyeon-jeong! Yu-ri! Mom? What are you doing here, Mom? Did Hyeon-jeong call you? Mom, did she say anything strange to you? "Anything strange"? What do you mean? I was just passing by, so I came in. Hey, can't I even give her a cup of coffee? I was just curious. Sorry. Mom, let's go home. I'm really hungry. My goodness. All right. -Thank you. I'll visit again. -Yes, Ms. Jeon. -Let's go. -Careful on your way back. MISAENG -You're that hungry? -Yes. -What did you get? -No, it's fine. -Let me hold that. Come on. -It's fine. You don't want to live? You don't want to live at all? I do. I really do, Hyeon-jeong. SUPERNATURAL POWERS SHAMAN MS. MI-DONG -Mom. -Yes? What? Nothing. I just wanted to call you. Am I annoying you? Of course not. I love it. I missed my daughter's chattering voice. Really? I could remember everything. Your face, your character, and even how your toes looked. But... one day, I couldn't remember your voice. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't remember. I felt so sorry about that. You don't need to feel sorry. They say the first thing that people forget is sound. It's just natural. It's not natural for a mother to forget her child's voice. I don't know what kind of miracle this is, but I pray every morning and night, saying thank you to Buddha again and again. What? Is it pretty? Do you want it? No, there's someone I want to buy it for. Mom, wait here just for a moment. I'll go and buy it. Come inside before I beat you up. Oh, I thought I came to the wrong room. What... Why are you sitting there like that in a room without the owner? I was doing some thinking. Why are you thinking in someone else's room? You have a much bigger room. He felt guilty. I think he didn't seek help earlier because his symptoms were the only reminder of what happened. He didn't want to forget everything. But you're telling me that he's receiving treatment nowadays, right? -Yes, sir. -Why? He wouldn't do it just because I made a fuss. I guess there must have been a change in his life recently. He didn't tell me, though. What is it? What? If you need to scold me, just get it over with. Why are you looking at me with that sad gaze? It doesn't suit you. You were the only one who didn't sign. So that's what this is about. I'm not mandated to sign. You were the one who started this proposal to ban giving priority to VIP patients. Will this change anything? Did it? I see. You've changed. You were dead set against it when I started it. Now, you're on the front line of this. I heard you're getting proper treatment. Why? Pardon? You told me to get treated. Exactly. Why? You've been refusing treatment for five years. You must have made up your mind somehow. Made up my mind? I didn't do such a thing. I just did it. Just because. Why do you always say that? Do you live just because you're alive? Yes. Hey, the old geezer is looking for you. You crazy jerk. He found you. That punk. You punk. Open the door. You jerk. PETITION AGAINST PRIORITIZING VIP PATIENTS These are some lightweight glasses. They will be way lighter than the glasses you're wearing now. Would you like to try them on? You're going home early these days. What do you have at home? Something amazing. What is this? Come on. That brat again. -Gosh, seriously. -Why? Is it your sister again? Yes. She wore my clothes again without my permission. And she always gets my clothes dirty after wearing them. Seriously. She's dead meat. I'll get going now. -Good work today. -Bye. Why is this here? -Yu-ri, this is yours. -Hey, this is yours. Why is that in your hand? Hey, you. Mom! Look at Yeon-ji! Damn it. Put it down. Or I'll really kill you. -Mom! -I told you not to wear my clothes. That's mine, too! When you wear my clothes, you always get them dirty! I made myself very clear that I'd rip all of your clothes if you wear my clothes again. How dare you talk to your older sister like that? Put that down right now! Gang-hwa bought that for me! As if I care! Put down my clothes right now! You're unbelievable. You! -You. -You're unbelievable. -You're done. -How dare you? Fine. It's the end for both of us! -Let go. -You must have a death wish. Yu-ri. My sister. Don't cry. Don't cry, Yeon-ji. You look beautiful. It looks nice on you. Really? You should put this in the center like this. There. -Dad. -Hey. What's wrong, Dad? It's nothing. I'm all right. I'm okay. I'm fine. That fool. I told him not to cry in front of her. My bestie. You're my bestie now. Hey, she's my bestie! She's mine. -She's mine. -Hey. You seem to be in a good mood. You think so? I guess I am. You know Hyeon-jeong? Hyeon-jeong? What about her? I'm going to be friends with her now. She seems like a nice person. Yes. That sounds great. Hyeon-jeong might be bad-tempered, but deep down, she's a nice person. I can't tell if it's a compliment or not. I'm not going to be considerate of you starting now. What do you mean? I want to be good friends with Hyeon-jeong... and... the lady who resembles Yu-ri. Seriously? She has such a strong energy. How many days does Yu-ri have left? I'm not the type to disclose personal information about people. Has it reached a halfway point? About 20 days? She has 20 days? That's less than a month. Find her a way. How could I find her a way? It's not like I didn't try. It doesn't have to be with Gang-hwa. She belongs with her family. That's her life, too. Will that not work? From our point of view, that makes sense, too. But as of now, there's nothing I can do for her. This isn't fair at all! Then you shouldn't have brought her back to begin with. You must be reasonable. You can't bring her back and take her again. Well, I wasn't the one who brought her back. If Gang-hwa gets divorced and Yu-ri goes back to her life with him, she doesn't have to die? Are you sure? Well... Ha-jun, Mama Hippo disappeared this morning without telling us why. -Where do you think she went? -To the zoo. To the zoo? What? What am I seeing? I didn't know she comes out to meet her clients, too. She's so diligent. Ha-jun, do you want to look around the zoo? Are you sure about that? Well, you know... First of all... Gosh, he startled me. Jeez. My goodness. You'd better leave. You... Hey, get lost. Go! Leave. What's that punk doing with him? Pardon? No, it's nothing. What? -It hurts! You're hurting me. -Unbelievable. -It hurts! -Why are you glued to that doctor? No, I was just following him around. That's the same thing. You're harassing him because he didn't diagnose you properly. -Okay, fine. Let go of me first. -Come here. -Come here. -I'll go. Fine. -I've been too lenient on you. -Why are you so strong? -Look over there. -What are you doing? PARK HYE-JIN You're first. You'll leave first. You heard that, right? If you committed suicide to start a new life, we should hurry this up, so you're reincarnated. She's not the only one who committed suicide! He committed suicide, too. Take him with you first. Damn it. Who said he committed suicide? No deaths here... are as wrongful and cruel as his death. Isn't sending the kids to school the hardest? -Tell me about it. -It's hard. It's especially hard for Chi-in. Well, you know. Excuse me. -Yes? -Are you just coming to work? It's not time for me to go home yet. That's true. Wait. I heard you're a kitchen assistant and Seo-woo's pick-up helper, too. Right. Seo-woo's mother is hard to please. It must be very hard. -Excuse me? -Seo-woo is different from the other kids. You know, she's a bit slow. Don't you agree? Hey. Seo-woo... is slow compared to other six-year-olds. However, I've been observing other kids at the kindergarten, and there are kids who are slower than her. -My gosh. -Like who? -Who are they? -Isn't it Ha-jun? Mi-so. -Chi-in. -What? Eun-bi. Seriously. What did she just say to me? My Mi-so is slow? What? Chi-in is slow? Has she gone mad? My daughter isn't slow! They don't want me to badmouth their kids. Only their kids are precious. They are such nasty mothers. You think you'll live forever, right? You know what? Wait until you die. You'll regret wasting time like that. What? Seo-woo's mom is going to abandon Seo-woo. Hello, Mi-so. What are you doing? I'm playing a secret-sharing game. A secret-sharing game? What secret? Seo-woo's mom is going to abandon Seo-woo. What? Who told you such a thing, Mi-so? I heard my mom and my dad talking about it. Goodness. I can't believe those women. -Honey, what are you doing? -Yes? Give me a second. I must tell Chi-in and Eun-bi's mom about Seo-woo and Ha-jun's mom. My goodness. Come on. You must be bored out of your mind. Here's today's update. Seo-woo's mom filed for divorce but didn't ask for alimony. Why? Ha-jun's dad was the late baseball player, Kang Bin's shrink. Kang Bin's fans threw eggs at him for dereliction of duty. Send. What is this? GROUP CHATROOM WITH MOTHERS FROM SUNSHINE CLASS Oh, no. What is it? No. What am I going to do? No, don't read it! -What am I going to do? -What is it? MI-SO'S MOM: HERE'S TODAY'S UPDATE She must think I'm a joke. I can't believe this bitch! Hyeon-jeong. Hey, this is the wrong chatroom. Unbelievable. MI-SO'S MOM LEFT THE CHATROOM -People are awfully mean. -Aren't they? I thought you didn't care. Yes, it doesn't get on my nerves. You keep lying to yourself. Of course, it's concerning when people insult you. Everyone stands up for themselves. We don't pretend like we're okay. -Really? -Of course. Even deities get angry when they're slandered. Should we face them and end this together? They must be out of their minds! How could they say that in front of their kid? Here. Unbelievable. Those crazy bitches. They must have gone nuts! Why don't they just put up a notice at the kindergarten? How should we destroy these bitches? Should we just give them hell? Give them hell? Do what? Why do you always torture people? No, Hyeon-jeong. Don't do that. Honey. Hello? This is bad. There's never a quiet day for you guys. I'm getting tired of that. You have two problems on your hands. What are you talking about? What did she say? Don't you remember Bruce Lee of Yeouido? Didn't I tell you? My life will be over trying to pay the settlement money. You're in the same boat. Gosh, Yu-ri. Have you forgotten how Hyeon-jeong and Yu-ri met? How could I forget? A BOOKSTORE IN 1999 Let go of it. I grabbed it first. Stop lying. I grabbed it first. It's crystal clear that I grabbed it first. I grabbed it first. You're ridiculous. Hey! -Hey. -Let go. Let go of me. I can't believe this. Hey. -Hey! You and your stupid yellow. -Hey. Bruce Lee of Yeouido. Gandalf of Yeouido. Hold on. What is Min-jeong doing in the middle? A sidekick? Seo-woo. Ha-jun. Let's cover up your legs. Hyeon-jeong. Hyeon-jeong, wait. Hold on. Let's talk about this. Hyeon-jeong! I'm playing with your mom. Go over there and play with your friends. My goodness. What is this? Oh, no. Goodness. Hey! You! My gosh. It hurts! Hey, I'm on your side! What is it? Oh, no. -No! -Hey! Did you see their faces? We totally destroyed them. Look at us. I can't believe you two fought them. Really? You had Mi-so's mom in a headlock. You almost killed her. No way. That's not nearly enough to kill her. Min-jeong was amazing. She used a baseball bat to beat them -with a blank look. -Right. It wasn't a real baseball bat. It was a toy. -No way. -My gosh. It was enough to kill people. -You swung it big like this. -Right. -I thought Chi-in's mom was going to die. -Same here. But that felt nice. I thought she was our sidekick, -but she was our boss. -Exactly. The boss? The boss, the leader, and the head. Okay. You two had great teamwork when we fought. Did you rehearse it? We even fought on our first encounter. A fan of Sechs Kies. A fan of H.O.T. Really? I don't think you would have liked any idol groups. -Right. -You only studied, right? I had a favorite, too. Who? Hey, let go of me! -You let go first! -It's mine! -I picked it up first! -Stop it! -I'm going to kill you. -Let me go! -I'm going to tell everyone. -Let go! -I got it first! -They're on the cover! A lackey? Hey. Hyeon-jeong and Yu-ri are Guan Yu and Zhang Fei, but Min-jeong is Zhuge Liang. They lose their temper easily, but they're stupid. Hyeon-jeong is Guan Yu. She's the oldest. Yes, sure. Congrats. Thanks. Darn it. Hey. Is it really okay to let them hang out? What will you do when Min-jeong finds out later? She likes Hyeon-jeong and Yu-ri. Min-jeong never liked anyone this much. How did things end up like this? What do you think? Yu-ri begged us not to tell. That's why. Gosh, Hyeon-jeong doesn't say anything, but she's probably dying between them. She's so worried that she can't seem to sleep. And she's losing her hair too. Cheers! Just thinking about Eun-bi's mom makes me laugh. I feel kind of bad for her. She didn't do anything wrong, but I went in there and did that. She's the nicest, so I feel really bad. Hey, I need to use the restroom. That's not the restroom. She's just going out to get some air. Let her go. I see. Do you want another drink? SEO-WOO'S MOM FILED FOR DIVORCE BUT DIDN'T ASK FOR ALIMONY. WHY? Don't you feel much better now that you made an example of them? How did you hold yourself back until now? I didn't. I vented in my own way. By drinking alone? How did you know? Your physiognomy? You're one strange woman. At times, you seem to know me better than myself. It's not easy for someone to see who they are. We're busy watching over others. Is that so? And that shows how nice you are. It's freezing. -I need to go to the restroom too. -Sure. Min-jeong. Yes? May I... ask you something? Sure. Go ahead. Will you... get divorced? The chat room. No. I'm not getting divorced. Weren't you going to? You caught me. I was going to. I grew too weary. Everyone tried to stop me when I said I was marrying him. But I was confident. I liked him too much. But over time, I began to realize that this is... far from easy. Other couples work together to lay one brick on another to make their own home. But I... felt like I had been repairing a house after it was bombed. Our house had marks from the bombing here and there. It's not a memory one can easily forget. Right. There's a room somewhere in Gang-hwa's heart. He knows he has that room... and so do you. You know, right? I do. It's a room I should never open up even if everyone in this world opens up to look at it. And that was really tough. That's why I wanted... to get divorced. But? But come to think about it, I love him too much. Gang-hwa loves her! Oh, Min-jeong. Gang-hwa loves her, doesn't he? You know that. You like that nurse. Stop denying it. I don't like her. I don't. No, Hyeon-jeong. Will you live your entire life missing Yu-ri? Is your life over without her? What's so bad about liking someone else? You didn't do anything wrong. What's next? What do I do next? Date her? Marry her? Why not? If you like each other, go ahead. Yu-ri would want that too. -Happy? -My goodness. Pretty flowers. -Go. -Yes. Okay. Okay. Hyeon-jeong. Were you talking about something serious? Put it here. Right there. Good job. That's it. Gosh, great job. What else should we put there, Seo-woo? Ta-da. Where should we put this? Hey. Where are you going, Seo-woo? Why did you bring that? Gosh, great job. Did you want to put it there? But Seo-woo, who is this? Cha Yu-ri. Seo-woo. Who? Cha Yu-ri. Gosh, you're so good. Is it fun? Is it? -Is it fun? -Yu-ri. -Gosh, it's so fun. -Cha Yu-ri! What? -We need to go. -Where? -There's something going on. -Let's go. What is it? 00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:30,733 It has been days. You said you'd do it today. I mean, that's concrete, so I can't do it with a normal nail. I need an electric drill and all. You said that yesterday! You said you'd bring it and do it today! I'm feeling heavy enough already. Do you know how hard it is to pick up the vacuum? -I'm sorry. -Darn it. I completely forgot. I'll make sure I get everything tomorrow and have it done, honey. Don't worry. I mean it. If I don't do it tomorrow, I won't even call myself a human. And honey, it doesn't really fall over if you let it stand like this. -Don't worry. -Darn you. My gosh, seriously. Gosh. If I had known the time given to us was this short, I would have treasured every insignificant moment. But life left some more time for me. Are you insane? Why would I call out her name around Seo-woo? Seo-woo knew Yu-ri's name. She called her Cha Yu-ri. -You know who I am, right? -Yes. I'm sorry. Min-jeong, let's get a new pick-up helper. That exorcist will be back. Stay by your daughter and protect her. What's all this? If someone tries to take Seo-woo, spray this in their eyeballs, okay? I'm here for your daughter. Seo-woo.
