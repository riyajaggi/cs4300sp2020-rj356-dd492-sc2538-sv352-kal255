 That's called parting. WRITE A POST MY FRIEND MY FRIEND, THE REST PLACE OF MY MIND MY CHA YU-RI, YU-RI, I MISS YOU At this moment of parting, someone will face the sorrow that's pouring in, as she faces in the reality. Some may turn a blind eye to the grief to protect themselves and to survive from this unbearable parting. However, turning a blind eye, passing of time or all the other things you are trying cannot help you overcome this sadness.

 EPISODE 8: PEOPLE WHO CAN'T SAY GOODBYE Hey, boss. Can I hold the umbrella? No, you can't. You're getting a free ride. You can't take the wheel. Don't you agree? You're right. Let's go. If you take it back, I'll have a little more... Can't you see that my shoulder is soaking wet? Gosh, my hair is wet too. Goodness. Gang-hwa. Hey, nosebleed. Fancy seeing you here. I have to go. Can I share your umbrella? -Wait for me. -You scared me! -What are you doing? -Let's share. -Let me come with you. -Gosh. My goodness. Hold up, ma'am. I mean, lady. I got all the way there from here. Now I'm back to square one. So what? Did I ask you to come with me? Take care of yourself from here. Well, I... What? Nosebleed! You should clean your place! "You should clean your place!" By the way, why were you with her? Well... You don't really like to talk to the neighbors. But you were laughing with her. Was I laughing? I see. Why was I laughing? She's a little odd. Seo-woo. You can't be this rude. Be more careful with these. Hey! My goodness. What are you doing? Is Seo-woo that precious to you? Sure. She's adorable, and she's sweet. Oh, it's fine. It sounded pretty bad, but my forehead is really firm so that blow didn't cause much pain. You look worse than me. You have two injuries. It must really hurt. She says I'm nice. Isn't that weird? What? Yes. You're nice. You don't mean that. Why do you think that? I guess she saw that you're nice. Then she'll have to be our pick-up helper. Okay. Are you out of your mind? You told her to do it? Do you know what a pick-up helper is? What are you going to do now? Should I work in Sri Lanka? Asia won't do. Go all the way to South Africa. Do our hospital have postings in South Africa? Are you kidding? Do I look like I'm kidding? No. Hey, you should've told Yu-ri no straight up. But she wants to do it. How can I tell her no when she wants to be with Seo-woo? This is so frustrating. Hyeon-jeong, call Yu-ri over. We need to discuss what we're going to do. She told us not to do anything, but she is stirring things up. Call her. -She won't come. -Why not? You're right. It's because I'm here. -She's avoiding me. -Why? It wasn't in her plan to meet me. She got caught by mistake. -Why? -Because he has Min-jeong. Yu-ri must've thought she was doing him wrong by showing up. She didn't come to find me. She bumped into me by mistake. Right. Yu-ri told Min-jeong -that she was nice. -Yu-ri said that? How would she know? It's not easy to know that if you aren't close. Hey. What? Have you ever told Yu-ri about Min-jeong? Of course not! She knew it all along. She already knew that I remarried, and that Min-jeong went to my college. What? I guess she could've found those out. But I feel like Yu-ri have known Min-jeong for a long time. Is it just me? She's definitely hiding something. I'm not here to ruin your life. Do you remember anything? Do you remember how you came back to life? No, I don't. But I think there's something I need to do. Something you need to do? What is it? That is... -I know. -You do? Of course, I know. It's even obvious to you. But she asked me to wait. I want to tell Min-jeong and take Yu-ri to her mother or something. But that's just me. For now, I'm going to wait for her. I'm with you. It's Cha Yu-ri we're talking about. Usually, she can never hold a secret. There must be a reason why she's acting this way. There must be a reason. Gosh, why aren't they giving me an answer? I know Yu-ri cursed them out, but I can't believe they revived her for that. She wasn't the first ghost to curse the deities out. There must be something. Hey, Gang-hwa. Is everything okay with Min-jeong? -Of course not. -Why not? Does she want a divorce? Where did that come from? Did Geun-sang make you lose your mind? Why are you being so dramatic? -No? -No. Since Yu-ri came back, I've been feeling bad, and it's hard to look Min-jeong in the eye. I see. Anyway, Hyeon-jeong. Yes? Seo-woo took a psychological assessment because the daycare suggested it. Well, language, cognitive ability, and development... All of those came out underdeveloped. Hyeon-jeong, what should I do? Well, it's not unexpected. Is she much slower than others? What did Min-jeong say? I told her not to be bothered by it. -Because it might not be a big deal. -What? Hey, Gang-hwa. You're unbelievable. What? This isn't something you should talk to me about. How can you tell Min-jeong don't be bothered? Well, I didn't want her to worry thinking that it was her fault. She has to deal with it though. You can't take care of that for her. Gosh. Being too considerate doesn't help. Okay. Gosh. Popo, have you been well? You've missed me, right? I can't go in there to play with you. Do as I say. All right. Down. Sit. Down. Good job. Well done. Popo, you're so smart. It's doing the tricks by itself again. But it's acting like someone is there. Being a human is so inconvenient. CALCIUM, MAGNESIUM, VITAMIN D+ Gosh, this is strange. Can't you really think of anyone? Anyone who owes you a thank you? Nobody. None of the neighbors said it was them. -I can't think of anyone either. -Then who? Who keeps leaving these gifts? How did they know you had bad liver? Supplements for the liver. Supplements for Mom's bad knees last time. Now it's calcium? Then, what are these? These are what's crazy. My friends don't even know that I drink beer with gummies. But how did they find out? I've been in the living room all day, and I didn't hear Popo bark. Not even once. But it always barks at people. This is really strange. Who could it be? They never leave fruit or beverages. It's always health supplements. No, I don't need it. -It's okay. -You said your knees hurt. You need to take calcium and magnesium. Dad has a bad liver, so he needs to take some milk thistle. Everyone takes health supplements these days. It's okay. Don't waste your money. Don't send them, okay? I won't take them. You take them. I'm still young. You and Dad should take them. I'll just send them over. Did you finish that? You finished that, didn't you? -Right? -That's crazy. Where are you going? I'm going out to get some fresh air. Where's the key for the bicycle? Will you ride the bike? It's cold out. -You'll catch a cold. -It's okay. Where's the key? I wonder if they're taking the supplements. I wish I could go check on them. This is so frustrating. Give me one. Gosh, it's cold. You might catch a cold. Put on a scarf. She's so adorable. She's about Seo-woo's age. Mom, you might catch a cold too. I'm okay. It's cold. Get me more pine cones. She likes playing outside. Gosh, she got me this pine cone. Do you like it? My mom has a granddaughter too. Oh, dear. Give me some more. I think she had too many sweets. Let her have some today. You should be careful. She's so cute. Here's one more. There is a lot of it. You're having fun. A BEAUTIFUL START JEONG GYEONG-HUN, KIM HYE-SU KIM PAN-SEOK Gosh, is your daughter getting married? His girl is getting married. What? Really? -Congratulations. -That's true. She's finally getting married. Congratulations. Thank you. It's not like I'm getting married though. You didn't say anything, but you've always worried. Your two daughters are almost 40, but they are still single. Hey, a woman in her 40s is just like a girl. That's true. Actually, he was single before he died. He was way over 40 though. Anyway, I guess you can go up there with your mind at ease now. You said you'd go up once one of your daughters get married. Ms. Mi-dong will be so excited to hear that. I know. Right. Now I can leave feeling relieved. What? Have you been staying here to see your daughter's wedding? Not really. I only had two daughters. There was no man in the family. I was worried that there were only three women in my family. You know it's a harsh world out there. So that's how a father with two daughters feel. Now that I'm having a son-in-law, I can leave without worries. Why? Are you leaving, Hye-su? Hey, let me come with you. By the way, why does the bride-to-be look so down? Gosh, I guess you're right. I know. By the way, Granny is not here. Isn't she here yet? -Granny? -Granny. There will be a ritual today. Come on out. What are you doing stuck in there? Granny? Gwi-sun. Hey, Jeong Gwi-sun. She's not in there, honey. She left earlier. Where did she go without telling me? Honey, do you need some painkillers? Gosh, no. I'm okay. How are you feeling? Is it painful? She rarely got painkillers. Right. She's being very patient. I'm okay, Doctor. It's tolerable. Most people would shout out in pain and ask for painkillers. You're amazing. Of course. She's my daughter. Well done. I'm proud of you. But you should tell us if it's painful. You don't take it too much. Okay. Why would he say that when she's being patient? Gosh, my girl. Well done. Sweetheart. I like things like this. It's simple. It's fancy, but not too fancy. And there he is. He just looks scruffy. -Did you not go to South Africa yet? -Aren't you going back to your planet? Aren't you working? Why are you idling away here? Are you going to South Africa? He wants to be dispatched there as soon as possible. You want paternity leave and dispatch while on disciplinary action? It's not possible, right? Of course not. Unless you are crazy. Thanks. You're so firm and straightforward. You always say your piece. My dad told me to see merits in people. You guys should understand him. He's not in his right mind now. Anyway, did you fail to get the limited edition watch? I didn't know there are things you can't get. I even tried an overseas direct purchase, but I couldn't find it. But I already saw it. It's not like I don't know about it. So I have to buy it. Then you should ask him. Who was wearing it? Gang Bin. -Me? -What? Gang Bin? The baseball player? Yes. Your manic depression and depression levels are low. But where did you buy that watch? What? Oh, that one. He does have an eye for watches. You're classy. By the way, Gang Bin didn't seem like someone who'd kill himself. Why did he commit suicide? That's mysterious. I should get back to work. Have some coffee. Gosh. Darn it. Since you work at the kindergarten, I don't need to see your resume. Please take good care of her from next week. NAME PICK-UP HELPER -Are you leaving? -Don't get up. See you. Seo-woo, see you later. Bye. Well... What? Why? You talked about the psychotherapy for Seo-woo the other day. Do you want to go to the center with me? You told me not to worry about it. What? Well... I did. Never mind. Don't worry. I'll see you later. What was that? Okay. I got it. Once I get there, I will kick out the ghost first. What are you talking about? If you keep cutting them like that, we will end up dying and becoming ghosts here. I understand. My gosh. Gosh, my eyes sting. What on earth did you understand? Gosh. That's not the right way. You should cut them this way. Gosh, this is frustrating. Gosh. -We have mandarins for snack today. -Okay. Ms. Kim, congratulations on your wedding. Thank you. The snack is ready. -Yes. -The mandarins look good. -Come on out. -Let's try this. You are dead! Now that the ghosts are gone, she's playing with other kids. Wait. Look at this. Watch me. Look at the color of this. What's that thing? Damn it. That's strange. What's wrong? What... Gosh. Hey! Don't you dare run away. What? What... Sir. How is this... I had no idea. I've been in and out of it often. I'm sorry about that. It's okay. You didn't know. I also didn't know for five years before it happened. I will never show up at the kindergarten now. Okay. By the way, I didn't know Ms. Kim was your daughter. She takes really good care of my daughter. Really? I didn't know the ties between ghosts can be connected to living people. I know. Both ghosts and people should live the right way. It's such a small world. Oh, right. Congratulations. Ms. Kim is getting married. Right. Now you can go up there feeling at ease. I guess so. Thank you. By the way, about Hye-su. Did something bad happen to her at the kindergarten? No. Why? She's getting married soon, so she's supposed to be happy. But she seems depressed and cries a lot. I wonder if she's sad that I won't be at her wedding. I didn't do anything good for her. I feel bad. Maybe I'm just being sensitive. That's too bad. The dead child is too concerned of her mother to leave this world. -What did you say? -She cries every day because of her mom. So you have your door thronged by evil spirits. Once you perform a ritual, it will get rid of them all. Or you can use this talisman. How dare you say such things? What are you talking about? Who's crying? You foolish lowlife. How dare you come here -and say things like that? -What? Do you even know her daughter? What's this thing? Gosh, this is my talisman. It's not like I'm a fraud. -Who are you? -Me? "Midongs". I'm Ms. Mi-dong. -What? -You just downloaded my talisman. You should pay for this. You can't download it illegally like that. It looks so cheap-looking. What do you think this is? Are you really Ms. Mi-dong? Yes. Don't move an inch. Damn it! -That damn wench. -Don't come. Don't you dare come near here again. Why are scumbags like that wandering around here? Damn it. She's not crying. She's just roaming around everywhere. Roaming around? My daughter? In this world? No, I didn't mean it. It's... You're just like her. I bet you guys make a lot of money performing exorcisms. That's something I've never seen before. Gosh, it's not like that. Gosh. Damn. This crazy mouth. My gosh. What's wrong? Did something happen at the temple? Nothing. That's not true. I'm sure something happened. Some ridiculous people got on my nerves. It's not like I'm a frog stoned to death. No. It's nothing. Forget it. -All right. Cheers. -Cheers. Cheers. -Let's drink. -Gosh, this is nice. Excuse me. I guess you are a drinker. Actually, drinking is my kind of thing. I can drink soju, beer, whiskey, and even kaoliang liquor. Good for you. You can drink a lot. I don't think she gets along with me though. That's not true. We click really well. Did you not know that? I guess I'm the only one who didn't know that. She works in the kitchen, but she roams around the kindergarten every day. We're not supposed to leave the kitchen. People shouldn't be so selfish and care only about their work. I should help the teachers and the director. I feel like the kindergarten is my own home. The problem is you don't even do your job right. Just mind your own business. It's true that she helps us a lot. -I see. -I bet you love children. I think she loves Seo-woo, not children. She only plays with Seo-woo all the time. It's just that I like cute kids. She's so adorable. She'll be so pretty when she grows up. Should she become an actress? I don't want her to be a celebrity though. Gosh, you sound like her real mom. She's silly. Seo-woo is really adorable. I know. Gosh, Ms. Kim. Your wedding is right around the corner. Stop drinking. It's okay. Give me that. I want to drink today. Ms. Kim. I understand. She's sad that she'll be married. -Just drink it up. -Let's drink. Cheers. Ms. Kim. What's wrong? Ms. Kim. Why are you crying before your wedding? Why would I get married? Why should I get married? Is it because you miss your dad? Your dad won't be at your wedding, so you're feeling sad. No. That's not it. Hye-su. My daughter. What's wrong? What's the matter? So I will walk down the aisle alone. But that doesn't matter. I'll feel sad for the moment, but I can deal with it. That's not the problem. I just feel bad for my dad. Why do you feel bad for your dad? If I didn't get married late... If I got married at an earlier age, my dad could've enjoyed the party. He devoted his whole life for his two daughters. But he just left without having a party. "You've raised your children so well. Your devotion finally pays off." He couldn't even hear things like that. He didn't even have a chance to brag about his children. If I look happy tomorrow, people will say this. "I feel so bad for the bride's father. He can't even attend his daughter's wedding." It's all my fault. My poor dad. I didn't do anything for my dad. I didn't even do things that all the other people do. Ms. Kim. Mr. Kim. What are you doing here at this late hour? You can't fall asleep at night after receiving chemotherapy. I know. Patients need to sleep well. Is it painful? You've been patient. It hurts. A lot. But I can tolerate it. Why? I don't know. Whenever I feel pain, I keep thinking of my mom. You may bid farewell to the patient now. Mom. It's me, Yeong-ae. Do you see me? Mom. Mom, please wake up. Mom, please. Wake up. Mom, please say something. Just one word. Mom. Mom, please wake up and say something to me. Mom. It... hurts. Mom. Mom... I'm sorry, Mom. My mom left in so much pain. She died in a lot of pain because of me. Yeong-ae... I insisted. I wanted to try everything that could be done. So I forced her to get treatment. Because of me, she had to leave in so much pain. So whenever I feel pain, I keep telling myself that it would've been a lot worse for my mom. So I have to put up with this. That's how I feel. That's how I endure it. It's not your fault. My gosh. Goodness, you fool. You fool. There's no such thing as a beautiful goodbye in this world. It only hurts more and more. You pretend you're over it, but there's always something broken inside. But it's been a while since her mother passed away. The older she gets, the more it'll hurt. Goodbyes hurt more as you get older and understand life better. If you think about it, how many people get to say goodbye and leave a will before they die? Gosh, those who can do that should know how lucky they are. I bet their ancestors were good people. You're right. Anyway, Mr. Kim must feel so sad. Too bad his daughter is going through this before such a happy occasion. People may say those things to comfort her, but I understand it can bother her. It would hurt her to know people feel sorry for her father. I know. Yu-ri. Mr. Kim. Well... Can you do me a favor? We have some time left before your hair appointment. Take your time. Okay. What is this? Who left it here? To my brightest jewel. It's okay. It's okay. It's no big deal. There, there. It's okay. It's my favorite dress. It's okay. It's okay. It's no big deal. UNIVERSITY REJECTION LETTER NAME: KIM HYE-SU I didn't get in. It's okay. It's okay. It's no big deal. -Stop crying. -I'm sorry, Dad. My goodness. It's okay. I'm sorry, Dad. It's okay. I didn't know my hardships would hurt you so deeply. I'm sorry I was such a poor dad. But my girl, I can tell you one thing for sure. Even though I was poor and powerless all my life, I always worked hard. So instead of feeling sorry for me, please remember me as a strong person. Also, don't think you've done nothing for me. I will always treasure the dental implants you got me. KIM PAN-SEOK Why did you follow me here? We're not here for you. It's Mr. Kim's daughter's wedding. There's no way we'd miss it. -Of course. -Did you think we were here for you? Gosh, you guys are such a bother. What did you say? Oh, nothing. I was just talking to myself. You scared me. Now the bride will enter. Let us welcome the bride! Too bad she has to walk herself down the aisle. I wish her father was here. I know. Mr. Kim! He looks so handsome in that lighting. Yes, even his facial expressions look good. Our friend did a great job raising his daughter, working as a driver all his life. What a beautiful, young lady. I know. She is thoughtful and kind-hearted too. Great job, Pan-seok. There is a reason why you should live an honest life. Your life is not only yours but also your parents'. WRONG PATTERN That's strange. I could've sworn this was the right one. I'm home. You came at the right time. Can you try and unlock your dad's phone? It keeps saying it's the wrong pattern. He changed it the other day. I did it for him. But why? I took a photo of Popo's diagnosis with his phone. The new vet wants it. Here. I'm taking a shower. What is all this? Gosh, why can't I keep my mouth shut? Why did I say something so unnecessary? Of course, she got angry after hearing her daughter's spirit is wandering around. Darn it. It's all that fake shaman's fault. Yu-ri will make a fuss if she finds out. Wait, where's my phone? TROUBLEMAKER MS. MI-DONG -Hello. -Hey, where are you? Me? I'm walking on the street. Why? Come over for a second. I have something to tell you. I-- I can't. I'm hungry, and I'm on my way to dinner. You come over to me. Bye. Hey. Hey, wait! Gosh, I can't believe her. Darn it. MESSAGE TROUBLEMAKER Gosh, is she serious? Whatever, who cares? Forget it. SUPERNATURAL POWERS "Supernatural powers," not "super weird"? Be quiet, you silly. -Are you a friend of Yu-ri's? -Oh, yes. No way. She's just a shaman I know. How could we be friends? She's as old as my mom. That's not true. I'm at least ten years younger than her. Come on, she looks a lot younger than you do. I've been too easy on you lately, haven't I? -Do I look easy to you? -See? She's one mean shaman. "Mean"? By the way, how long have you known her? You don't believe in superstitions. Well, after coming back to life, I started thinking there may be something in shamanism after all. So I went to her to ask about why I came back to life. That’s how we became close. -Right? -Absolutely. Also, it's not superstition. It's humanism. So why did she come back to life? And how? Well, the thing is... Don't. What happened is... It happens sometimes. I'm still looking into it. I'm figuring out why she came back to life. Hyeon-jeong, I'm craving stir-fried pork and mung bean sprouts. Oh, sure. But I'm out of mung bean sprouts. Just a second. No mung bean sprouts? Well, go ahead and eat. Please. I'm going to the supermarket. You're the best. You're the best ever. I bet she was so frustrated that she went to see a shaman. What? My mom? Are you crazy? Why did you say that to her? I mean... I'm sorry. I was just trying to drive away that fake shaman. It was a slip of the tongue. I can never keep my mouth shut. I can't believe you. Explain this to me. What do you mean? You volunteered at Seo-woo's kindergarten? And you even took pictures? Yes. Didn't I tell you to stay away from Seo-woo? Why won't you listen to me? I was just volunteering. What's so wrong with that? Can't I even go and peep at her? How many times do I have to tell you we can't show up in front of her? She thinks her current mother is her real mother. What if she finds out? I know all that. But I can't help it. I think of her whenever I see a toy. There's nothing I can do about it! I miss her so much! Do you think you're the only one? I miss her too. I really do. Do you think this is easy for me? I miss my daughter and granddaughter like crazy too. I miss them so much that it tears my heart out! She may pretend to be okay, but she really isn't. She's just holding it back. -I know that. -Then why did you say that to her? I'm sorry. My gosh. But listen. If you know how much your mom is suffering, shouldn't you do something? What are you trying to say? You should take your place back as fast as you can. Then you can live. -Your mom doesn't have to suffer anymore. -That's enough. We're done with this. I'm not going to do that. I'm going up once Seo-woo becomes okay. I can't seem to find the answer no matter how much I pray, but if you think about it, it may not be so important why the deities brought you back to life. Just take your place back within 49 days, and you won't lose your life again. No matter what the deities think, take this chance and take your life back. I said, stop. I don't want to. What is this all about? Hyeon-jeong. What was she talking about? You have to take your place back within 49 days? Otherwise, you will lose your life again? Hello. Gang-hwa, where are you? Hyeon-jeong? I'm home. Hyeon-jeong, please don't do this. I beg you. Is this it? Is this what you've been hiding? That you'll die again in 49 days? Why would you die again? Why? You can live. You just have to take your place back. So why? There is no place for me anymore. There is. You can take it back. Is Min-jeong what you're worried about? You have to live. Don't you want to live until Seo-woo calls you mom? You're her mom. It's not important that I'm her mom. Then what's important? Hyeon-jeong... Seo-woo is sick because of me. Because of me. I just need her to be healthy. What about you? What's going to happen to you? Don't you think it's unfair? You died at such a young age without getting to hold your own baby once. Even I feel it's so unfair! No. I can't let you go like this. Never. Gang-hwa loves her! Oh Min-jeong. Gang-hwa loves her, doesn't he? You know that. What would be more important than that? Hyeon-jeong. All I want is that Gang-hwa doesn't cry. That's all I want. Gang-hwa, get in our car. You can't drive right now. -I'll pick up your car-- -Don't worry about me. I'll be fine. Just get in our car. All right. Drive safely. We'll come over later. I am happy I am happy I am happy I am really happy The day I've been waiting for has come It's such a joyful day Throw your shoulders back And stick out your chest Wear casual clothes And meet your warm friends With a joyful heart Run around the fields and mountains And sing Let's all sing together I am happy I am happy I am happy I am really happy Yu-ri. Okay. Yu-ri, I understand. Hyeon-jeong. Mr. Cha. Why don't you go inside and get some sleep? I'm fine. Go get some rest. You can go home. You must be tired. I'm okay. I'll be right back. Bring my baby back! My baby. My baby. Bring her back! Bring her back! My baby. My baby. Bring her back! We could never possibly find a way to deal with goodbyes. What should we do? Mom has a weak heart. -Yu-ri? -Yu-ri? Are we dreaming? Is she gone? You know our pick-up helper, right? I'll make sure you stop seeing things like that. -You bastard. -Me? Your kid looks just like you. It belongs to Yu-ri. It's where Yu-ri should be. I think we can let her go now. Mom. Subtitle translation by Young-ju Kim
