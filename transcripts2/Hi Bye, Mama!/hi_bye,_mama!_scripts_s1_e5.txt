 This stop is Dongsung University. You may exit on your right. Your bag... Wait! Excuse me! Hey, what are you guys doing there? -Min-jeong. -Hey. Whose is that? I picked it up on the subway. Should I have left it at the station? Hey, Cho Gang-hwa. -Hello, Professor! -Is that all you have to say?

 Don't you have something for me? What? What should I give you? Bullets of love! Bang, bang! -You little punk. Unbelievable. -I'm sorry. Do you want to fail this semester? You still didn't hand in the report. Oh, my report. I brought it, of course. My bag! My goodness. You're a med school student. Aren't you supposed to be smart? Did you lose your brain after the entrance exam? No, I'm sure I brought my bag when I left home today. That's strange. Where is it? My bag... There are some moments

 when a small coincidence you experience grows into a huge thing called fate. You're really going to tell him you like him? He's known as the med school idiot. He even wore mismatched shoes last time. That's his charm. You know, real geniuses are actually idiots. You're ridiculous. He just seems like a real idiot. He's not a genius at all. Even this idiot got a girlfriend. Why don't we have girlfriends? That's what I mean. Are you happy? Did you say her name was Cha Yu-ri? Is she pretty? Let go of me. Don't be so old-fashioned. You shouldn't judge women based on their looks. Looks aren't important. The heart is what matters. -But she's really pretty. -Back then, I thought that kind of fate could change back into a small coincidence. -This jerk... -My gosh! CHA YU-RI, CHO GANG-HWA EPISODE 5: EVERY MOMENT WHEN CHANCE TURNS INTO FATE Wow, 3,000 won for two radishes... It's scary to even buy food to eat. Yu-ri... Yu-ri... Yu-ri... SISTER'S GRILLED EEL Who leaves... NEW NOTIFICATION CHA YU-RI LIKES YOUR POST Listen. Don't get too startled. Yu-ri... has come back to life. I have to call Hyeon-jeong. Geun-sang, calm down. There are no such things as ghosts. Geun-sang. Ghosts don't exist. There is no such thing. But there is! She's right there! There is a ghost! Hyeon-jeong. Hyeon-jeong. Do you know what I just saw? Yu-ri. It was Yu-ri. Yu-ri! It's Yu-ri! Yu-ri! Behind you, Hyeon-jeong! Behind you... No, don't wave at me. Hyeon-jeong, she's waving... Why is she waving at me? I'm sorry! I'm really sorry! I'm sorry! I missed you. Hyeon-jeong... Hyeon-jeong... PEOPLE COMING BACK FROM THE DEAD Dead... MY FRIEND CAME BACK FROM THE DEAD! There are cases like this! Did you click this, you idiot? You really believed it? Damn it! You little jerk. I should report jerks like this. Is this for real? All the ridiculous things you said are true? What? How did he find out? Dr. Jang told you to wait! Where are you going? -Tell him I couldn't wait. -What? Tell him I was waiting for him desperately. Fist bump? Okay, never mind. What's gotten into him these days? He doesn't get how serious this is. Right. He's doing anything he wants when he's been disciplined. Seeing him just makes me pity Dr. Jang now. He's coming. What do we say? -Bathroom? -Well... He left. He left? Oh, no! Dr. Jang! -Oh, my gosh! -Dr. Jang! That hurt. Is this... Is this even possible? -Where was your honeymoon? -Okinawa. -You got scammed-- -Germanium bracelets. Right. She's right. -It really is her. -You really can't remember anything? No. No way. My aunt definitely said people become ghosts when they die. Ghosts? Don't be ridiculous. I've never even seen ghosts. So what are you going to do now? What? Well... What do you think we should do? Sorry, I... Your mother. Let's go to your mother's house first. -Your mother... -No, I can't. What? I mean... My mom has a weak heart, and... Anyway, not right now. Don't ever tell her about this if you run into her, okay? -You too, okay? -What? All right. Then stay at our house. Why stay at a hotel? Go check out her room and get her stuff here. Will you do that, Hyeon-jeong? I'd really be grateful. Don't do that, you guys. Just for two months. No, just 49 days. Just leave me be for 49 days. And after that, I'll decide whether to go to my mom or whatever. -So just don't do anything right now. -But it'll be better to stay-- I was hiding because I thought you'd worry like this. You really don't need to worry, Hyeon-jeong. Do whatever you want. I'm glad you're back. I'm glad. I'm so glad. I'm so glad you're back, Yu-ri. Thank you. I thought you'd gone mad over the last few days. I'm amazed that you are so calm. It'll be crazy not to go mad in this situation. What should I do now? Don't ask me. I don't know, either. Nobody in Korea would know. Nobody in this world would know. A situation like this can't even be imagined. This is just... Hey, what about Min-jeong? Does she know about this? -She saw her. -What? Did you introduce them? "This is my wife, and this is my dead wife." Don't be ridiculous. They ran into each other at the kindergarten. Min-jeong just thought she looked like Yu-ri. She only saw her photos. Right. She wouldn't believe it even if you told her. Wait. But still, don't you think you should tell her? So what if I tell her? What do I say if she asks what I'm going to do about it? What do I tell her? That would just be overwhelming her to make the decision that I should make. I guess you're right. No need for both of you to go mad when it can stop with one. Anyway, just listen to Yu-ri and don't do anything for now. To be honest, there's nothing you can really do. And Yu-ri asked us to wait for 49 days, didn't she? Let's just watch how things go for now. This should be good news, but why do I feel that something's wrong? I feel guilty. Thank you... Yu-ri... They're still crying. Yu-ri... Are you feeling okay? Hyeon-jeong really cried a lot. She must be really glad. Hyeon-jeong missed me so much. She cried every day. She did. What? How did you know that? Well, I saw my social media. She wrote a lot of posts on mine, saying she missed me. I can imagine how she was. It's a relief. At least she's glad. I feel grateful. Mommy is sorry. I just collapsed with shock instead of showing happiness at seeing you. Yes? No, everything is fine. Yes? Yes, it's working fine. Here. Were there problems in the other rooms last night? -You kept calling my room. -Oh, that? Actually... Do you have any problems with your room? All right, thank you. She answered. She's in her room. All right. Thank you. Can you check just one more time? You checked two hours ago. -We haven't seen her leave. -Just once more. It's not about her leaving the room, it's... How should I explain it? I'm worried she might disappear... I mean... Please, just once more. All right. I'll call her. Is the hot water coming out? Actually, the man who checked in kept asking me to check. He said he was worried you might disappear. You idiot. Just let me off over there. What? I think she's hiding something. Why isn't she going to her parents' house? They may faint, but it's from happiness. She asked us to give her 49 days to think over things. Hyeon-jeong, that's the weirdest part. It's either one month or two. What's with the 49 days? It seems ominous. Will she disappear again after 49 days? -Hey. -But it makes sense. She showed up all of a sudden, she could disappear all of a sudden. My gosh, you didn't have to. You should just eat them yourself. What is it? I got it from Jeongdongjin. They're wild seaweed, so it'll taste great if you make seaweed soup. Is that so? Thank you, I'll enjoy it. All right, bye. What did she give you? What is it? Mom? What is it? Why is she acting like that? My gosh. Not again... PRESS TO START STOCK INVESTMENT Do-yeon? You haven't finished filling this out. -Oh, the kitchen assistant interview? -Yes. Ms. Oh. I'll get going. -Oh, you're leaving? -Yes. -Thank you for your work. -No problem. There's nothing to clean, even if I only come once a week. Other houses are a total mess. The husband makes a mess, and the wife follows him around, cleaning up after him. -My goodness. -I guess other families are like that. That's right. There aren't many husbands like yours. He puts stuff back in their place without you having to nag. There's nothing much to do. But sometimes you feel sad if there's nothing to clean up after. -Bye, then. -Bye. Are you leaving? Do you want to eat something? No, it's fine. This is enough for me. No need to make a fuss preparing food. The photo of Seo-woo's mom... The photo? What about it? It disappeared, so I was curious. Well... I just... The photo... No, there's nothing to explain. I was just saying. I got curious, so I thought I'd take a look at it. They said it's going to snow tonight. Oh, I got an umbrella. Bye, then. Bye, Seo-woo. Seo-woo, shall we go to the kindergarten now? Okay. What are all these, Seo-woo? Hello. RED BEANS It hurts. Why are you hurting me? It hurts! Wait! It stings. Hold on! It hurts so much! No! Who on earth are you? Why are you doing this to us? -How can she see us though? -I guess she's a shaman. Of course. I can see you because I'm a shaman. Let's cut to the chase. Starting today, no ghosts are allowed inside that kindergarten. All of you are old enough to understand what I'm saying, right? Leave when I ask nicely. You can't kick out ghosts! This was my spot long before you came along. I won't leave! Suit yourself! Hey, hey. You know, I believe in communicating whether it's people or ghosts. I don't use violence or anything to sort out problems. And these don't hurt at all. They don't, right? They don't hurt at all. Isn't that true? Damn it. She is a shaman. -Let go of me. -Gosh, what is this? -Let me go. -I was doing fine as a ghost. -Why are you torturing me? -Okay. I'll leave. I'll leave this place. -Really? -Yes. You should have complied from the get-go. We just ended up wasting our energy. Damn it. Damn you! Go far away from here. Go far away. Go! Goodbye! Don't come back! Never come back here! Goodness, you're quite strange. You made a huge mess in the kitchen yesterday. Why do you keep scattering the red beans that the kids use to play games with? I was going to use it just for a bit. Oh, yes. Kids were supposed to feel these and play games with them. Right? I'll go and buy another bag right now. I'm sorry. She seems to be in a good mood. RED BEANS Should I have bought some more? I should put some in Seo-woo's bag too. This will do. DOLLS Pink. Seo-woo loves those. What? What was that? I haven't warmed up my fingers yet. Why can't I get one? This is so annoying. Come on. Hey. -Me? -Yes, you. Can you sell one of them? Okay. Which one? This? Not that one. Something a five-year-old girl would love at first sight. -The pink one. -I see. This one? No. Why would I sell this to you? You have a lot. You don't run a doll shop, do you? It's not like you need them. Sell it to me. It cost you 1,000 won. I'll give you 3,000 won. It's a good deal. What? 1,000 won? I had to stack it, put it up, and support it. It cost me 3,000 won. Also, the cost of my labor. My hourly rate is pretty expensive, so I'm actually losing money. Fine. Okay. Can you help me get that one? Where did he go? He didn't even eat yet. I swear I saw him just moments ago. -Dad. -What? You'd better get this. I have only 1,000 won left. Look. You can't go after this one from the beginning. That one. You have a higher chance of winning that. No freaking way. Seo-woo likes pink! I'm so close getting it, anyway. I just need to push it in. Here I go. -Hey! -My gosh! My gosh, you startled me! You said you were so busy you didn't have time to help us. What are you doing here with my son? Excuse me. What's wrong with you? Who are you talking to? Your son? Him? Right. He's that guy. Me? What about me? What is it? Isn't my son so handsome? He takes after me. He's handsome and all. Can you do us a favor? My gosh. Did something go wrong with his DNA? How could someone like you give birth to a tall guy like him? What are you talking about? You're scaring me. Well, I'm just saying that you look just like your parents. I don't have any parents. My son. What do you mean you don't have parents? Your mother is right here. Right. Hey. Can you cook a meal for my son? It's been over a week since he had a proper meal. He only eats noodles, bread, and instant food. At this rate, he might die before his time. Seriously? That's all you wanted? You're so weird. Really weird. That's a huge favor to ask! Making sure my baby is fed is the most important thing. Come on, you and I are both parents. Can you please do us this favor? I'm begging you. Please do this for us. -Please. Do this for us. -Please. -Hey. -What? What is it now? I'll cook for you. In exchange, give me that doll. You ought to. You failed to win the other one. You can't blame me for that. I messed up because you scared me. Why would you cook for me? The negotiation fell through. -Come on, you promised! -You're unbelievable. -It's just a meal. -Come on. -Do this for us. -You said you'd do it. -Just this once. -Just do it. -You know this was-- -Gosh. Be quiet. Forget it! Whatever! I don't need that. Hey, hold on. Stop looking at me. You're bleeding. It means you're a human. You deserved that. Why did you steal his doll? Darn it. -How dare you steal from me? -Come on. You've been punished for stealing with your nosebleed. Take this instead. Or not if you don't want it. He's a grown man. Why would he like pink dolls? Is he a pervert? No, he's not. Pil-seung is a man. He's super manly! We all saw it. Stop talking. Yu-ri, we're doing this for your sake. People at the cinerarium are going crazy to find you. She's right. What if they all find out about you? Your 49 days will be over, trying to do favors for those ghosts. No, hold on a second. You only have 44 days left already. -Gosh. -Oh, no. What will she do? You guys make such a nice family. Gosh, you're so persistent. -Isn't that true, honey? -That's true. No. Right. Yes. If you don't help us out, we'll stay glued to your daughter. What? You guys are unbelievable! Don't you dare go near my daughter! I won't let that slide! What? What are you... I won't let you slide for this! Okay? Damn it. Oh, darn it. What on earth is going on? You told me not to get caught. They'll make my life very difficult. When Pil-seung's family found out about you, it was over, you fool. Anyway, you all understood what I just explained to you, right? So you're saying that Yu-ri will face her judgment for 49 days as a human. But since she's somewhat like a shaman, she can't help us or get involved in our business? You got it. In other words, don't ask her to do favors for you. She can't help you, anyway. This is so not fair! Why does she get special treatment? I want to face my judgment here and go up. Relax. -Ms. Mi-dong wasn't behind this. -You... She's being punished by the deities for badmouthing them. You! You stupid jerk! -Gosh. -Oh, no. Come over here! We should have a go at each other! It won't work with you. Swearwords take up half of your sentences. You think they'll care? Damn it. Well, it just happened... Gosh. Something must have happened to you. You must have expressed awful resentment for them to allow this to happen. Seeing how they gave her a chance, I'm sure they must have an ultimate plan for her. -Right? -Yes. I'm sure of it. I keep praying to find out what it is, but they won't give me an answer. Did you go see your mother? No. Why would I? Why wouldn't you go? She should've been the first to visit. No one misses you more than your mother. Why? Are you afraid that she would faint out of shock? No. I'll disappear after turning Seo-woo back to normal. What's the point? I'll just end up giving her false hope. Goodness. Can't you just take your place? Yes. Forget it. Once a human or a ghost starts to get greedy, it's endless. I'll be happy as long as Seo-woo doesn't see ghosts and live a happy life. RED BEANS Goodness. Seo-woo, can you look at this? I'm very curious. What letter does the word, "crocodile" begin with? Seo-woo, you know the answer to this. You told me what it was yesterday, didn't you? Seo-woo. She needs to work on phonics, but before that, she doesn't speak. She won't talk at all. After assessing her, she can't get into any English kindergarten, let alone a prestigious English kindergarten. I see. Ma'am. How often do you talk to your daughter? Pardon? I talk to her if I need to. Why do you ask? It's important for children to talk to their moms before the age of six instead of learning by memorization. Best to let them talk as much as they can. I see. Seo-woo. Is it good? Yes. My son. Tell me how good it is. It tastes so, so, so good! If it's so, so, so good, it means it's the tastiest ice cream! Of course. It's better than a hundred ice creams! Mom, do you know what a hundred is? That's a really big number. It's bigger than ten! A hundred? My gosh, you're adorable. Let me try it too. Ta-da. Isn't this awesome? I could cook a meal for you. Not this junk food. What do you mean? Look. A convenience store is as good as a restaurant. Tteokbokki, fishcake, and trotter. I can add an egg in the ramyeon too. This is so amazing. We always say that time flies by. But when we look back, nothing stays the same. A lot of things have changed, right? Of course, things must change. It's been almost five years. You know what? I'm not disappointed at all. I'm glad for these changes. So don't worry about me. Goodness. Seo-woo's stepmother... Don't you want to know who she is? No, I don't. Why not? I mean, I would want to know what kind of person she is the most. Because I know what kind of person she is. You do? A good person. She's a good person. Right? Yes, that's right. She's a good person. -Let's eat. -Fine. Let's eat. Dig in. All right. What is it? What? Where are you going? What? Why... I see. Well... Hello. You must need to buy something. Yes. Yu-ri. Yu-ri, are you okay? I'm okay. She must have run out of alcohol. That's right, Ms. Oh Min-jeong. You know how to drink. You like soju. You totally belong to my club. Thank you. Bye. Bye. There's only one table here. I see. Right. They usually set up more than one table. You don't have a drinking buddy. When people drink alone, don't they drink at home? People in this neighborhood gossip too much. I see. I thought that didn't bother you. Does that bother you? No, it doesn't. I'm not bothered by it. Of course, it bothers her. She's acting tough. Mothers in this neighborhood gossip about kids. What they are doing is truly ugly. Just ignore them. No. That doesn't bother me at all. That's good to hear then. Is Seo-woo that odd? I was wondering if she's that different from Ha-jun. What's wrong with your stomach? Does it hurt a lot? Where? Did you eat something bad? What is it? Is she sick? She says her stomach hurts. Forget about the kindergarten. Let's get her to a hospital. -Let's get changed. -All of a sudden? She was fine just now. Seo-woo, are you okay? Yes. You said your stomach hurts. -It doesn't? -No. In that case, I'll button you up again. She seems to be fine. Exactly. She said she was in pain. She must have recovered quickly because she's so young. Okay. -Shall we? -Yes. Okay, let's go. 2019 SUNSHINE CLASS PARENT PARTICIPATION PROGRAM BRIGHT HAEMIL KINDERGARTEN There's Yul-hee's mom. Hey! -Hello. -Hello. -Hello. -Hello. Your shoulders will get dislocated. Put him down. Son? What completes fashion? Coolness! Coolness! Yes, you have to look cool. Do you think David Beckham worked out his arms to play soccer? He did it to look cool in the parent participation programs. You're such a big talker. Mr. Cho, hello. -Yes, hello. -Hello. Why... Why is he... What is he going to do? -Hello. -Hello. Hi, Min-jeong. Why on earth are you... Hello. What? He should come. Everyone is supposed to. Of course. I was just joking. Of course, he should be here. It's a parent participation day. Gosh, Seo-woo. You're so adorable. Are you insane? Are you crazy? Why are you here? What are you going to do? Let's go. We should go. We're late. Let's go in. They're going to run into her. What's his plan? What plan? I hope she just finds out everything. Let's go. Goodness. We're running out of time. What are you doing? -Aren't you going to take this out? -Right, yes. Whatever. What are the chances of running into her? I just won't leave the kitchen. -Goodness. -Take this to the sensory playroom. I have to get fruit ready. What? I'll... I'll cut up the fruit. It's your first time doing this. You can't do that. Just take this to the room. No, wait, I... Excuse me. Yes? You must use that often. The red beans. Yes, kind of. Excuse me. I'm Elsa. Aren't you jealous? I am. Mi-so, do you want to go next? Who do you think lives between A and C? -O. -No, that's not it. -B. -It's B. -B. -It's B. -B! -B! You're right! -B! -All right! Her mom just told her. Ha-jun, do you want to go next? -You can do it! -Okay. Which letter of the alphabet do we need between B and D to complete this? -C. -It's C. Ha-jun. Hey, Ha-jun. -Look at me. C. -C. Hey, man. C. Ha-jun. Ha-jun. C. It's C. Onion ring. You're right. It's an onion ring. Onion ring. Hey, where's Yu-ri? No idea. I don't see her. I think she's staying in the kitchen. What's with you? I told you to come up with an excuse not to come today. Do you think I wanted to come? Do you think I want to be here? I suggested we go out and tried saying Seo-woo is sick. I tried! If that worked, I wouldn't be here. Anyway, it looks like Yu-ri will stay hidden too. I'm sure it'll pass. Whatever. What are you doing? -Let it pass. -Okay. -Let's go after this is over. -Let's go. -Yes. -We should. Let's go. What are you wearing? Just let it pass. Let it pass. -Let's feel it. -All right! Daddy, look at this! Seo-woo. Don't come to this side. There are more red beans on that side. Mi-so can't play if you keep messing these up. Seo-woo, come over here. -Let's play with these. -Okay. Seo-woo. You can't be this rude. Be more careful with these. Hey! My goodness. What are you doing? It looked like you needed more red beans. This is how you do sensory play. -Everyone! -All right! -Yes! -More red beans! -Let's do it! -All right! Darn it. Mi-so's mom really gets on my nerves. Gosh, I'm so pissed. I thought you'd be back right after you dropped it off. What took you so long? They're going to play with skewers. Three skewers per family. Strawberries. Seo-woo loves strawberries. She'll be thrilled. It's so good. You know what? I went to every corner of Seoul then I had to go to a town right below Seoul to get these strawberries. -Isn't it good? -It is. I just crave strawberries and nothing else. -Our kid will be a strawberry fanatic. -What? A strawberry fanatic? This isn't good. I'll quit working as a doctor to start a strawberry farm. No. Oh, okay. We'll just keep buying strawberries. Yes, that's it. Give the strawberry to Seo-woo. Hey, not that one. Give the strawberry to Seo-woo. My gosh, she likes strawberries. She has no idea what the kid likes. Seo-woo, you like strawberries, don't you? Okay, Sunshine Class! -Yes, yes, teacher! -Yes, yes, teacher! All right, we're going to give you some fruit. -Yes! -You can make some fruit skewers with your mommy and daddy. -Yes, yes, teacher. -Yes, yes, teacher. All right. Okay. Yes. No. -Enjoy. -Thank you. Look at mine. You don't have to give her strawberries. It's all right. I see. But these are very delicious. It's not too sour. It's okay. You don't have to give it to her. But she'll love it. Ms. Cha, Seo-woo can't have strawberries. She's allergic to strawberries. She can't have it. She's allergic? Goodness, I'm so sorry. I didn't know. I'm sorry. -Ouch! -Goodness, Seo-woo. Seo-woo! Are you all right? Goodness, that must have hurt. Are you all right, Seo-woo? That must hurt. Are you all right? MISAENG Are you okay? You couldn't have known what she's allergic to. That can happen. I gave birth to Ha-jun and raised him, but I have no idea everything he's allergic to. Do you think she knows? -What? -That I'm Cha Yu-ri. I think she definitely knows at this point. What do I do, Hyeon-jeong? Things were already risky enough. Why did I suddenly step in? Are you more worried about that? Goodness, Yu-ri. Of course! I can't let her find out. Why not? You have to tell her anyway. Will you continue to live as the kitchen lady? Aren't you going to raise Seo-woo? No. What? Why not? Well, you know... You can't tell anyone else. -Actually... -Actually? I'm... I'm a... A... A... This is Ms. Oh Min-jeong, a new addition to Gynecology Department. I was appointed last week, and this is my first day. Nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you, Min-jeong. We need the Gynecology Department in operating room six. An expecting mother's emergency. The mother was in a car accident, but the infant is breathing all right. -Check the neonatal unit and send her. -Okay. Coincidence was already making itself bigger and bigger unbeknownst to me. -Did you beat me? -Me? Look at your face. What happened last night? It makes no sense that only Yu-ri became a human! I can't take my place back. Stop! You don't want to raise her yourself? You're keeping a distance from Gang-hwa because of Min-jeong. They may not be living too great of a life. They look too much alike, from head to toes. You're getting divorced? You can be Seo-woo's mom. Subtitle translation by Eun-sook Yoon
