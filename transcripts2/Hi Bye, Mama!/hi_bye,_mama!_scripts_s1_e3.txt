 Do you need anything else? -Could we have more sauce? -Okay. He's a fraud, not a husband. Everything he said when we were dating was a lie. He said his senior told him if he's too good to his wife, he'll lose power. So he says he can't let me have my way. How can he be so stubborn over such a petty thing? You left with your stuff over a petty thing too. You can't expect a guy to sit down to pee when he's peed standing up his whole life. Hyeon-jeong, this isn't just a simple matter about how he uses the toilet.

 -This is a matter of pride. -You really are newly-weds. You're so cute. All right. I get you. Cho Gang-hwa, that little punk. He's the problem, isn't he? Eat up first. You said you haven't eaten anything. No, I'm not going to eat. They say that those who die after eating look better as ghosts too. Come on. Eat. I'm so angry. I don't feel like eating anything. Hyeon-jeong. Maybe I shouldn't have married him. All right. Just eat up. Eat. I won't go home even if he comes here and begs on his knees. Okay, I get you.

 Back then, when I never expected my death, I was preoccupied with petty emotions in everyday life and didn't realize what really mattered. Just eat up first. Let's talk after you eat. I really don't feel like eating. I know, I understand. But still, you should eat. -I'm really going to end it this time. -Then break up with him. But even if you do, do it after you eat. Come on, open your mouth. Here, eat this. Being able to eat something and touch the person I love, and being alive and breathing, even in the hardest of times... I only realized how beautiful that is after I died. EPISODE 3: REALIZING THE BEAUTY OF LIFE IS ONLY POSSIBLE AFTER DEATH -Cha Yu-ri! -You're mistaken. What... How... How can this be? I'm such an idiot. How could I have gotten caught like that? Should I just tell him the truth? Oh, that's what happened. I get it now. So you need to go back to your place within 49 days to completely come to life. You need to be my wife. Oh, but there's a problem. The position of my wife is occupied right now. I have a wife already. What? Seo-woo sees ghosts? And you came to get rid of them? Oh, that's what happened. I get it now. You could've told me before. Hang on. But how is Seo-woo able to see ghosts now? Don't tell me... Were you lingering around us as a ghost? That's scary. Gosh, I'm getting the chills. How can I tell him that? I'd be scared too if I heard that a ghost was lingering around. How do I explain this? SPECIALIST DOCTOR EXAM RESULTS Stop chewing the straw. It's bad for your health. Just leave me be. I'm so anxious. I'm the one who should be anxious, you know. I mean, it's not a dream. Whatever. Just pretend I'm not her. There are lots of people who look alike. CHO GANG-HWA IDIOT There was... only one person... around me... who doodled and wrote stuff like this. It's you. I'm sure it's really you, but how... How can you be here in front of me? How is this possible? Tell me. Come on, say something. Come on. Where were you? What happened? What? Oh, sorry. My friend... -My friend-- -Which friend? How can they just take our kid... What's wrong? You look like you've seen a ghost or something. Go home first. I need to go somewhere for a minute. Gang-hwa! You woke up, and you were at a charnel house? Do you remember anything about before you woke up? It's been four years. I mean, do you know it's been four years? I don't know. I can't remember anything. I remember that I died. But I woke up, and it's the present. What... Did you rise from the dead or something? No... That doesn't really make sense either. That's what I want to say. This doesn't make sense. It's so ridiculous. I'm sure I died. How am I alive again? Maybe... What is it? Do you remember something? A vacation as a reward. Maybe I got something like that. For about 49 days. Maybe I was a model soul in the other world, like how there are model prisoners in jail. So you were given a vacation? -By who? -Well... I guess someone like... God? God? Well... MIN-JEONG: WHAT'S GOING ON? I need to go to the bathroom for a minute. Okay. Go. WHAT'S GOING ON? Seo-woo, who were you with today? You weren't with the pick-up helper. A pretty Auntie. "A pretty Auntie"? A woman? Seo-woo, what happened to your hand? What did she do with someone else's kid? I really didn't mean for this to happen. I should just leave for now. What? Where is she going? Yu-ri! Yu-ri. Where are you going? Well... I... What's with you? Why do you keep running away? It's me. It's me, Gang-hwa. Cho Gang-hwa. Right. Cho Gang-hwa. I'm just so startled right now. I really didn't mean for this to happen. I don't know what situation you're in right now. What I mean is that... Well... Maybe we both need some time to think things over. Something like that. Don't go anywhere, and just stay here. I'll come back tomorrow. And use this to buy anything you want to eat. Thanks. -You should go. -What? Right. Don't go anywhere. Stay right here, okay? Don't leave. I'll get going now. Gang-hwa. Yes? What is it? Do you have something to say? I'm sorry about earlier. About taking Seo-woo. Why did I have to get caught like that? What do I do now? Hi. Hey, Seo-woo. Hyeon-jeong, that looks delicious. You know, maybe it's that. What? A ghost. Are you insane? That hurt! Watch what you say. Are you saying Yu-ri's lingering as a ghost? I think I really saw her. I actually saw her for a second. My aunt said I have some psychic abilities. Stop eating them! That hurts! Okay, I'll stop! I'll stop eating them! I'm not going to eat them! -Don't eat them! -You're so mean! -They're not even tasty! -You ate a ton! -Enjoy your food. -You little... My baby... Honey! Ha-jun woke up because of you! -My Ha-jun. -Did you wake up because Mommy yelled like a hippo? It's okay, I'll scold that loud hippo. -What? -Let's punish the hippo. Die, Hippo! -Come over here. -The hippo... -Do you want to get beaten by the hippo? -Sorry. -I won't do that again. -Don't you dare. My goodness. Sorry about that. Eat up. I'm raising two sons right now. That kid is a doctor, though. A neuropsychiatrist. But he has mental problems himself. You hippo! Die, Hippo! Get out of our restaurant, Hippo! Stop talking to the customers and leave, you hippo! -Hey! -Hippo! -Come over here! -Hippo! MISAENG Does this make sense? It does. I saw her with my own eyes. I even talked to her. What do I do now? All right. First, I should tell her mother and father. I tell them, and then say... What should I say, though? What... That I remarried? How can I tell Yu-ri that? Can you see Yu-ri? -My gosh. -Hyeon-jeong. What? How did you know? Your blabbermouth friend lives with me. So many people look alike. Will you act like this every time? -Why are you suddenly acting like this? -Hyeon-jeong. Listen. Don't get too startled. -It's not someone who looks like her. -No? -Geun-sang was just overreacting? -No, I mean... Don't be surprised. Yu-ri... has come back to life. Oh, really? I'm telling you, Yu-ri came back to life. -Right. -What? That's great. Just wonderful, you lunatic. -How ridiculous. -Hey, I wasn't... I mean it! I'm telling the truth, Hyeon-jeong. She must have fallen down. Her hand was hurt. Who was it? What? What is it? -Were you listening to me? -Of course. I'm sorry. I've got a lot on my mind right now. What did you say? I'm sorry. What? What are you sorry for? For losing Seo-woo. It was my fault. What are you talking about? It's not your fault. Well. What happened was... My friend knows Seo-woo well, so they were hanging out. So... It's actually my fault. I should've told you beforehand. I'm sorry. Who's that friend? My friend? Just a friend. We can meet together later. Oh, what time is it? Let's sleep. It's late. You should sleep now too. -What is it at this hour? -What? Well... What... CARD PAYMENT CHICKEN 21,000 WON My goodness. This is a lot. Wow. My gosh. They're my juniors. I gave them my card to use when they're on the night shift. But... My gosh. I guess they were really hungry. They're ordering a lot. Thank you. -Thank you. -Thank you. Oh, it's the pizza. Over here! This is so awesome. It has been so long. What should I eat first? What should I eat? It's hot. Beer. Yes, beer. My babies. My beer. You've been hiding here. That hit the spot. If I go to sleep, I'd be wasting a day. There's no time to sleep. MY MISTER It's starting. HER WATERY KIMCHI Why? Does it taste a bit too familiar? How did you... -At the ER and the restaurant -What? -Who did it? -Let's watch the news. -Damn it. -Shall we? She just splashed the watery kimchi over him. Put it back on. Come on, switch the channel. Hey. Since when did you watch the news? You're a sucker for dramas! You guys are unbelievable! Come on, put it back on. Please? She's about to slap him. This is good. Darn it... Come on. Being a ghost really sucks. Look at that. BEAUTIFULLY COOKED FRIED CHICKEN FLOATS UP BEST LATE-NIGHT SNACK Doesn't that look delicious? Of course, it does. It's none other than fried chicken. Even shoes would taste good if they were fried. Knowing its taste can be more torturous. It'd hurt less if I didn't know. If I could go back in time, I wouldn't leave any fried chicken behind. I left some the day before I died. If you could, don't kill yourself. Will you kill yourself after eating that? I mean, times have changed. But they still serve the same food at the memorial ceremony. They should at least change the menu every year. They've been serving the same food for 54 years! Am I in Oldboy or something? Mi-ja. Yes, sir. Do you need something? How dare you raise your voice? That's no way for a woman to behave. I am sorry, sir. We should go inside now. Unbelievable. What about his son? Why does he always bother his daughter-in-law? He bothers her even when he's dead. Exactly. Who is that family lot really for? That awful man. By the way, given how I haven't seen Yu-ri for the past few days, something must have happened to her. Has anyone seen her lately? Not me. You? Me, neither. I haven't seen her. Have you seen her? I saw. See what? What did I see? -No. -I haven't seen her. For 49 days? Now, I have 47 days. I told you that you shouldn't stay next to a child. Well, children have weak energy. I should take care of him first. I must handle him. I don't have time for this. I turned in a report on you. So get treated. Look. A surgeon is unable to enter the OR because he's claustrophobic. Do you think that is acceptable? The disciplinary committee is in a meeting! Disciplinary committee? Don't be anxious. It doesn't suit you. That's cute. I'll try to get you off with a warning. What are you doing? Are you going to resign? I can't see patients then, right? I'm off now. Hey, Gang-hwa. Hey! Sir, he must be insane. Gang-hwa. Right. I shouldn't handle this by myself. I should explain this to my mother-in-law first. Then-- Have you gone mad? Or are you trying to go crazy? This isn't like you. Where are you going right now? You won't believe me. I confided in your wife, she almost beat me up. She beats me up for breathing. Talk to me. Talk to me. We'll see if I believe you or not. Will you believe me? I doubt you will. I'll try to believe you. Tell me. Go ahead. Yu-ri came back to life. -What? -Yu-ri came back to life. I see. My gosh. -Gang-hwa, come here. -I knew you wouldn't believe me. Leave me alone. Take photos for your online posts. You come back here. Hey! You must be out of your mind. We'll never figure out how she became a human again on our own. We must find and ask her. Where could we find her? There are only so many places she can go. We'll easily find her. By the way, why did you not want to tell the others at the cinerarium? It would be easier if everyone helped to find her, wouldn't it? Listen to yourself. Then, she'll have every ghost following her. What if they ask her a bunch of favors? Do you think she will have time to help us? Right. My gosh, you really thought this through. You're right. She can see both ghosts and humans. There he is. My son, what did you do in that room all night? Gosh, you lost weight overnight. Isn't it obvious? He went inside with a woman. I doubt they just talked. I'm sure they shared more than just words. You little punk. They had a meeting. They were very focused on their meeting. -What's up? Are you sick? -What is it? -What's wrong? -What? -Don't work too hard. -What's wrong? -Hey. -Are you sick? -You tend to focus too much on meetings! -Are you? There are ghosts all over this place. I didn't get this before, but I get it now. -Do something. -What? He must handle it himself. What can we do? Just wait. -Mom. -Let's go. Damn it. Did they put a GPS tracker on me? They are everywhere I go! Yu-ri. I know you can see us. Please? -When was my appointment? -Help us. Yu-ri, please help us. We are at the same cinerarium. Yu-ri. My poor son, Pil-seung. Honey, don't cry. -Please? Don't cry. -Pil-seung. -He can handle it himself. -Oh, no. Poor baby. -Pil-seung. -Oh, no. Are you sure no one is inside? -I'm going in. -Okay. -Go. -Go, go. No, I can't do that. Damn it. I can't believe this. Wipe it well! Thoroughly. Clean it well! Thank you. I was just so worried. My gosh. He's a grown man. You don't need to worry about him. He might be a grown man, but he still can't take care of it well. Right. That's hard for me too. Hello. Why isn't anyone in Room 554? She left earlier. She left? Did you say she left? Why? I mean, when did she leave? It's not like she disappeared all of a sudden, right? She didn't vanish into thin air before your eyes, right? She left the room key with us. And she walked out that door. She walked out. I see. I'm sorry. Thank you. I told her to stay in the room. Where did she go? Judged? You came back to life because you're facing the 49-day judgment here? Why? Why only you? You jerk! -She's gone mad. -I would've gone to hell for saying that. Right. Why did He let you live? She needs to find her rightful place in 49 days. She'll live then. Right. Damn it. Good for you. You should find your place right now. Her husband remarried. Do you think she'd just swoop in and take her place? Right, your husband remarried. When you first came to the cinerarium, he came every day and cried his eyes out. He looked so loyal. But who knew he'd remarry that fast? He stopped coming at once. Why are you bringing it up? It's a long time ago. Then, does it mean you're a human for these 49 days? Yes, I can go up only after the 49 days. Then, do us a favor. We won't tell the others that you became a human. No. I already have a lot on my plate, trying to turn Seo-woo back to normal. If I start doing favors for ghosts, I'll waste all of my time. No. You forgot I just helped you are asking me for another favor. No way. Never! Come on, that was an urgent matter! She's right. Do us a favor! We'll tell every ghost that you can see ghosts! What? No! I have something to tell my daughter. I hid some money in the cabinet. -But my son used all of it. -Tell my wife -it's in the fridge. -You know what he did? -Please help me. -Just one favor. -No. I can't hear anything. -Just this once. -Please help me. -Move out of the way. -Do me this one favor! -I really need to tell him that. Oh, no. My gosh. Please keep my family healthy. Please help us. Great! -I'm begging you. -Great. Keep them safe! Accept our prayer! Have mercy on them! Have mercy on them! Oh, my. Don't you think she's getting better at performing as time passes? She'll be able to stand on a straw cutter soon. Goodness. Be quiet if you want to get some food from her. -Excuse me. -Don't talk to me. I'm not into you. By the way, are you really gay? We're really curious. Gosh, I'm about to starve to death! Stop that nonsense and take out your bells! You're begging for food here. Don't be grumpy. She's performing the ritual. Her customer must get her money's worth. My goodness, there are so many mischievous spirits here. Oh, my. I should just send all of you up. Yeah, right, Ms. Mi-dong. I know you're a softy inside. You can't even send an ant up. By the way, what is Yu-ri up to? Where on earth is she? She's missing the ritual. I haven't seen her for a few days. Did something happen? Should I go look for her? Why would you? She's probably roaming around here and there. -Where are you going? -Stop! -Hey! -Miss! Wait for me! -Where did she go? -Come on! This is what Ms. Mi-dong meant when she said it'd be exhausting. I totally understand how you're feeling. But I already have so much on my plate. This one. And that. Give me two of these. My goodness. Oh, my knees. Where could she go? HEALTH SUPPLEMENTS: 71,000 WON, PAID IN FULL Health supplements? Yes. Both my parents are here, Gang-hwa. There's nothing new around the house. It's all the same. What? The calming pill? Make them take one. Just trust me and do it. And you should take one too. Right? I'm warning you. Something crazy is about to happen. I need you to stay calm. Okay? I'll be there soon. Take it. -What? -Why did you take this out? Take it. And I should take it too. What are you talking about? Did you have a dream? Get that out of my face. Gang-hwa told me to give this to you. He said we should take it and wait for him. You brat. I told you not to stay in touch with Gang-hwa. He's doing well now. Don't drag him to our lives. I didn't drag him here. He was the one who called me first. He said it was urgent. Call him back. Why is he coming here? He'd better not come. Or I'll give you a good beating. He said he was coming! What can I do about that? She's driving me nuts. Is he coming alone? Will he not bring Seo-woo? I don't know. But something is off. He kept asking if something had happened with us, as if something had. Here. I won't take it. Seriously? You touched it. Coming! Gang-hwa. Yeon-ji. Everything's okay? It looks like something happened to you. Did you guys have a visitor? It's... -"It's"? -It's... What? What is this? Did you buy this? SUPPLEMENTS FOR KNEES How did you know that my mom has bad knees? Gang-hwa, don't buy stuff like this. My mom will seriously kill me. So who's coming? You said someone was coming. I guess she already did. Who? Well... Later. I don't think you should hear it from me. It's cold outside. Go inside. Bye. Gang-hwa, who's coming to visit us? Gang-hwa! What was that? Damn it. This won't be pretty. It ended. I hope he didn't follow Seo-woo home. Hey. Come here. It's all right. Come here. Come here. You're happy that I can see you, aren't you? What's your name? Did you come here because you wanted to play with your friends? But you can't. If you stay here, you might hurt my daughter. Actually, you might hurt everyone here. Why don't we go somewhere else and play? Come here. Excuse me. Who are you? Didn't you pick Seo-woo up yesterday? You're her dad's friend, right? Pardon? You should have told me so if you were his friend. I thought you were a pick-up helper. I know I should've confirmed it with you no matter how busy I was, but... Where are you going? -Hey, kid. -Pardon? Who? He can't go inside. Are you looking to hire a kitchen assistant? We can't serve hot beverages here. It's iced coffee. Is that okay? Sure. But the meeting with the parents is taking longer than expected. So the director will be late. Is that really okay with you? She can interview you tomorrow. That's all right. Waiting is my hobby. I can just sit here. What's so hard about that? Okay, then. -The meeting must go well today. -Okay. Just trust me. It's not that I don't trust you. -I'm just worried. -Just trust me on this. -You're here, ma'am. -Hello. -Hello, hello. -This way, please. -Hello. -Hello, Director. I definitely saw him come in here. It's about Seo-woo. I'm sorry to say this, but it's getting scary. This wasn't her first time. I heard she gets kind of gloomy and talks to herself in a corner. We understand your concern, ma'am. We've been keeping our eyes on her too. And we plan on sharing this with her mother soon. Goodness, there's just no talking to her. She won't even budge. Why do you think we came to talk to you? She said she'll manage and that it's none of our business. It's not like we want to be concerned. Of course, Seo-woo didn't do anything wrong, but still, my kids come to this kindergarten. It feels kind of icky with this. We're bringing this up for our children's sake. I knew it would be those mothers. Darn them. Why are they acting so immature over a child? There's nothing wrong with my Seo-woo. "Icky"? Seo-woo. Ma'am, Seo-woo hasn't gone home yet. Could you please lower your voice? See? I knew it. She's always the last to go home. -How can she be okay if she's overlooked? -Seo-woo, let's play over there. I told you that I think she probably married him for money. He's a doctor at a university hospital. She'd get a fortune if she got half of his assets as alimony. KO SEOK-WON LAW OFFICE Yes, this is Ko Seok-won's law office. KO SEOK-WON LAW OFFICE, DIVORCE, CUSTODY, INHERITANCE There aren't any grounds for divorce. He's not liable for anything. -Min-jeong. -Hey. You must be worried about your husband. Are you all right? My husband? No, I was just passing by. I came in to see you. Why? Is something going on? Min-jeong... You haven't heard? Everything hit the fan today. I thought you came because of that. He cut open a patient's belly, but couldn't operate, so he just left. He'll be referred to a disciplinary committee. He might even get fired. JW LAW FIRM, DIVORCE ATTORNEY This is the only place she could be. I'm sorry. Mommy is sorry. Mommy is so sorry. I'm so sorry, Seo-woo. Please stop crying. Mommy is sorry. -Gang-hwa. -Yes? What is it? Do you have something to say? I'm sorry about earlier. About taking Seo-woo. I'll pick up Seo-woo today. Wait, no. -Hello? -No, it's okay. It's okay, Min-jeong. I'll go. You're at the hospital. How can you do that? No, I'm not at the hospital. I've been dismissed as a punishment. So... Never mind, I don't mean that I was punished. Anyway, something like that has happened, so you can go home for now. I'm almost at the kindergarten. See you at home. Hello? Hey... I found this in your study. What? Right. Why was it there? It's okay. I guess it fell off from one of your old books. -You probably didn't know either. -Right. Anyway, it's Yu-ri, isn't it? Seo-woo's mother. Yu-ri. Yu-ri is... This can't happen. What do I do? You're nothing but a darling, Seo-woo. Those adults are fools. Seo-woo, I'll make sure you won't have to see things like those. I'll do that. Anyway, where did he go? No. You were great today. -I told you I can be good. -What has gotten into you? Anyway, who's that other woman? No idea. A new teacher, probably. -She's really pretty. -You and your lookism. -My goodness! -Seo-woo is in there. Wow, that brat. -Put-off. -She's so cool. Hey. -Stop that. -What's with you? I knew you were too good today. Hello, I'm Sella. Hello. Do you want to take a picture? No... Seo-woo, where are you going? Hello, Ms. Oh. Hello. -Don't run, Seo-woo. You'll fall. -Seo-woo. Gang-hwa. Hey. Hello. You never miss a year. Of course, it's her birthday after all. She can't take my present, but I can't let her be lonely. My dear Yu-ri. GLASS: THREE-THOUSAND YEARS OF HISTORY GLASS ART AS A PROFESSIONAL PATTERNS My daughter. My beloved daughter. Are you listening to me? Yes, I love you too. Mom, are you listening to me too? Perhaps the most beautiful thing we can feel in our lives is telling someone we love that we love them and thanking someone who we're grateful for. PREMIUM SUPPLEMENT CHA MU-PUNG, JEON EUN-SUK, CHA YU-RI, CHA YEON-JI SISTER'S GRILLED EEL Who leaves... snacks for drinks in front of a bar? Thank you. Thanks for the food! I realized that it's a great joy to give and that you end up feeling sorry if you always receive. I came to this realization after my death through the people I love. She looks a lot like Yu-ri. Did you do something wrong? Seo-woo's mom came back to life. What is this nonsense? What's going on? -It's a ghost! -A ghost? I'm going to rip your mouth. When will you get your place back? If I get a job there, I can chase away all the ghosts and see Seo-woo every single day. We have no time to see the kids. You don't have much time left. You only have 46 days. It all happened because of me. I'll have to resolve it.
