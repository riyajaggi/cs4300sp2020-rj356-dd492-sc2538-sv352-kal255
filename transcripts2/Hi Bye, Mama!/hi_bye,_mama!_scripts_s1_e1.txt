 GANG-HWA AND YU-RI, AGE 24 My gosh! Come on! Wait! I told you, I'm not going! I'm not going, you crazy jerk! The exams are starting soon, and what? Soccer? You must be out of your mind. And you look like a fly right now. Hey! Hyeon-jeong said she's bringing a friend. She's really pretty! Gang-hwa, we did so much to get into college. You're just going to study? What about dating? I'm not going to date anyone. That's not why I came here.

 Med school students shouldn't slack off. You should be ashamed to face your parents. Hey. Didn't I tell you not to talk about my parents? Gye Geun-sang, that little jerk! A medical student? Gosh, you invited them without telling me? I'm leaving. Hey, wait! We're just going to watch soccer. I'm not telling you to date him. I don't feel comfortable meeting guys. All right, I get it. My goodness. Just sit back down. Come on. -Welcome. -Hello. A player with a good scoring ability... Hey, I'm only staying for 30 minutes, all right? Who told you to date her? We're just going to watch soccer.

 -Okay. Hurry up. -It's your fault we couldn't watch-- Soccer really isn't important right now. Unbelievable. -Hyeon-jeong! -Honey! It's Kim Dong-jin! Hey, I brought my friend. It only took us three seconds to see each other and fall in love. Love approached us at an unexpected moment, pretending to be something ordinary. Yu-ri! -Are classes over? -Yes. FIRST DAY OF DATING WHAT SHOULD WE DO TO CELEBRATE 100 DAYS OF DATING? Look at this. GANG-HWA! YES? I TOLD MY PARENTS... THAT I'M SPENDING THE NIGHT AT HYEON-JEONG'S! SECOND ANNIVERSARY ENDED WITH A FIGHT Yu-ri, I'm so sorry. What are you sorry about? What? You idiot. THREE YEARS TOGETHER ALREADY Hey, put me down. THEY'RE A COUPLE TOO! I'M SO LONELY! As if mocking that short moment, our love lasted years. During that long time together, we believed that our destiny was invincible. All right, the 2010 World Cup, held in South Africa... GANG-HWA AND YU-RI, AGE 28 I was... I was just about to leave, but another patient was... I wonder why the ER is like that. This always happens when my shift is about to end. It's really annoying, right? I'll pour that... Here. Okay, I can pour my own drink. Here. All right. Cheers... Okay, I'll just drink it. All right. I can't do this any more. No, Yu-ri. I'm really sorry. It's my fault. Yu-ri, please. I... Let's just... All right, Park Ji-sung has the ball. Park Ji-sung! Okay, he's going! He's running toward the goal. Park Ji-sung! -Yes, shoot! -Let's get married. Goal! What? What did you just say? I'll live with you! Marry me, Cho Gang-hwa! -Park Ji-sung! -Park Ji-sung! Park Ji-sung! SOUTH AFRICA WORLD CUP 2010 SOUTH KOREA VS. GREECE I love you too I will Love you longer I’ll make you smile forever If we Live together No! I love you too I will Love you more I’ll make you smile forever If we Live together I love you too I will Love you more -I’ll make you smile forever -I’ll make you smile forever -If we -If we -Live together -Live together We believed in the 13 years together, thinking... -Thank you! -...it would be unbreakable. PRESENT TIME GANG-HWA AND YURI, AGE 37 Seo-woo, come and eat. Mommy finished making our meal. Seo-woo. Seo-woo, don't touch that. Mommy's going to get angry. That's dangerous! No, Seo-woo! Cho Seo-woo. You shouldn't touch. It's dangerous. Mommy is going to get upset. Come here. But life didn't turn out the way we wanted, and no one expected our parting. EPISODE 1 LIFE IS FULL OF UNPREDICTABLE SURPRISES Why did you put water there? It's so dangerous! If you were just a second late... Kids her age cause trouble the minute you take your eyes off them. Hey, are you listening to me? She can't see me, right? But why is she showing attitude? What was that about? Seo-woo! Seo-woo, you seem to be in a good mood today. Good girl. I am a ghost. A ghost that people cannot see. One of the things people are mistaken about, something that they can never know when they're alive, is that humans are not the only ones living in this world. There are actually so many beings living together in this world, even if they can't see them. Gye Geun-sang. -You have constipation, right? Drink this. -What? How could you do that to your friend? You jerk. -Mommy said... -Including us ghosts. You almost got in huge trouble today, didn't you? My little baby, you're so adorable! Give Mommy a kiss. Give me a kiss. Come on, hurry! Have a great day! -Bye! -Bye! Bye-bye! Hey, should we go? Ms. Oh? Are you busy? Come join us for coffee today. That's right. Stop rejecting us and come with us. It'll be fun to chat together. I don't enjoy hanging out in groups. She's so rude. Gosh, that Put-off. -What does that mean? -It's her nickname. It's because her daughter must be put off by her. She's just five years old right now, but she's sent to art, English, and ballet academies all day. That's why she's Put-off? I guess that makes sense. She wouldn't do that if Seo-woo was her own kid. She's not her real kid? Seo-woo's dad got remarried after his ex-wife died. She's sending Seo-woo to academies since it's hard to look after her. So Seo-woo's real mother is dead... -No wonder why she seemed-- -A bit dark, right? You felt that too, right? If you watch her closely... She's a bit dark and strange. -Hey, mothers! -Oh, my gosh. I know people are nosy about other families' kids, but you should watch what you say. -We didn't... -We weren't saying... We all die eventually. I heard you're going on a trip to Bali soon. The volcano didn't erupt yet in Bali, right? Gosh, what's up with her? MISAENG She's not dark at all. She just seems that way to them because they think so. How could a five-year-old kid be dark? They just have to die to realize. It's better to have one more look at my own kid than to chat about other people's kids. Do they think they'll live forever or what? They won't be badmouthing this place again, will they? I don't care if they do. Whatever. Nothing I can do about it. I'm not scared of starving. They can curse as much as they want. Damn it. I want to just rip everything. I'll just peel all this with my bare hands. I'm going to rip out everything. Darn it. I should get a knife. CHO GANG-HWA IS AN IDIOT! We got your ECG test results, and you do have an arrhythmia. But it will be a simple surgery, so you don't need to worry. You'll be doing the surgery, right? No, a doctor much more skilled than me will do it, so don't worry. I see. All right. Okay, thank you. All right. Bye. Check Doctor Jang's schedule and give him the patient's data. All right, thanks. -I'm sick right now! -Sir... -I'm sick! I need treatment! -When you're sober... Come back when you're sober. -I... -You're drunk... Come back again tomorrow. -Where's the doctor? -The doctors' schedules are full. -I... -You should head back now. -Come on. -Get me the doctor! -Calm down. -Sober up and come back tomorrow. -No! I'm really sick. -My goodness. Do you get it? Let go of me. I told you, I'm sick! You're just drunk right now. No, I'm not drunk! Hey, come over here. Go that way. I'm going to the computer room. Go that way, okay? You punk. Go on. -I said I'm sick! -Sir! You're drunk! Sir! I told you, I'm sick! Who is he? He's not a doctor! -Come on! -My goodness. My gosh. All right. -Did you eat, Doctor? -Yes. Doctor Cho, Doctor Jang was looking for you. In what way? Was he like, "Did you see Doctor Cho?" Or did he yell, "Where's that bastard, Cho Gang-hwa?" Did he swear? How did he say it? I think it was the latter. Thanks. Thank you. Your manic depression and depression levels are low. -But where did you buy that watch? -What? Oh, I mean... And no obsession or bulimia. -Can I touch it? -Excuse me? AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY Come back again next time. "Come back again"? Don't be ridiculous. How could you say that at a hospital? -Did you see? -What, that man? Is it your first time seeing an athlete? Gosh, is he a baseball player or a celebrity? No, I meant his watch! Did you see his watch? It's a limited edition. I tried to get my hands on it for a year but I failed. How did he get that? Do celebrities get it first? You're a celebrity in our hospital too. You're famous. Come on. Get inside. My gosh. Well, I get it. Did you see how he looked in his outfit? You can't be a popular celebrity just with a good-looking face. The face and body proportions are important. I guess I'm known for that. I didn't mean that kind of celebrity. I meant that you're famous for being crazy. -"Crazy"? -Yes, crazy. Whatever. Just come over here and give me the doctor's note. Doctor Jang is looking for me. My gosh. You're crazy. How long are you going to keep this up? Just tell him the truth and receive treatment for it. How are you, Doctor Jang? -I'm not fine. -All right. You. I've been calling you for three days. Why didn't you come? Well, you know... I had a lot of patients to see, so... As a doctor, I couldn't abandon them. -Patients are the most important-- -Stop the bullshit. You say that, but you're only treating outpatients all the time. Don't you feel guilty at all when you see the others in our department spending day and night performing surgeries? I'm not letting you off now. You'd better begin surgeries starting next month. If you don't want to perform surgeries, why are you at a university hospital? Just open your own clinic! Why would I open a thoracic clinic? It'll fail for sure. That's a crazy idea. Why would you suggest that? What did you say, you punk? Plus, it's not because I don't want to. I give you a doctor's note every month, asking you to understand. What if my hand starts shaking when I'm operating? I might cause a terrible accident. Then we'll all be doomed. He's right, Doctor Jang. I was actually talking to him about it. -Shut up! -Okay. -Bring it here. -Okay. All right. Bring it to him. Give me that. "Difficulty concentrating due to irregular routines and insomnia. Symptoms of hand tremors and bipolar disorder. Seemed lethargic and depressed yesterday, but seemed to be in a great mood after 6 p.m." I'm lethargic when I come to work in the morning -and I feel great when I get off work too. -Right. Me, too. "Felt extreme happiness after drinking and felt extreme pain the next day." What pain? A hangover. Do you call this a doctor's note? It's a best friend's note! You little... You crazy jerks! You jerk... I didn't do anything wrong. Don't say that to me. It's your fault. Do you have a brain to think? -Hello. -Hello. OPERATION ROOM, INTENSIVE CARE UNIT I am happy I am happy I am really happy The day I've been waiting for has come It's such a joyful day Throw your shoulders back And stick out your chest Wear casual clothes And meet your warm friends With a joyful heart Run around the fields and mountains And sing Let's all sing together I am... I am happy I am happy I am... Seo-woo, your dad's here. -You're home early today. -Yes. Did you have fun today, Seo-woo? "Fun"? She went to the daycare center, an art academy, a ballet academy, and an English academy. -Nothing much happened today? -No, nothing. "Nothing"? Hey, your daughter was in huge danger today. She could've been electrocuted and followed me here! Seo-woo. Let's do the dance too. Great! Just can't take your eyes off your handsome husband, can you? You must be wondering how I can be so handsome. Don't be ridiculous. I'm looking at you in advance since I won't be able to see you a lot now. Are you going somewhere without me? When I give birth to our baby, I won't have time to see you. I'll be really busy. Look at my face in advance too. It will be hard to see me soon. All right, I will do as you tell me. Let's see that face of yours. Hey! Stop that! I'll look at you like this... Hey! Come over here. -Let me do that too. -Stay still. Cho Seo-woo. I told you not to spill your food, right? Don't be too harsh. A kid can spill some food. You spilled it, so pick it back up and eat it. Seo-woo, you're five now. You should be able to do it yourself. My gosh. She's only five. What could she do on her own? He said he wore diapers until he was five. How ridiculous. I'm going to tell Seo-woo everything when she grows up. -My baby, what did you have for lunch? -Pork cutlet. -Do you want sausage stew for dinner? -Yes! I'll make you a delicious sausage stew. DECEASED GANG SANG-BONG The funeral of baseball player Gang Bin, who was found dead in his home a few days ago, began today. The police believe that he may have made such a drastic decision due to rumors on the match-fixing scandal and his homosexuality. The team that Gang Bin played for... JEONG GWI-SUN CHA YU-RI Damn it. -Who are you? -Seriously? Did we just scare him? Because we are ghosts? Who the heck are you guys? Excuse my language. Who are you? We're the Grim Reapers, punk! If you're new here, you should try to make a good impression on us. Why are you crying your eyes out? You're being loud! Well, this is his first time dying. He's basically a baby. Everyone dies only once. Aren't you Gang Bin? I can't believe this! -The king of stealing bases? Really? -Yes, Gang Bin. My goodness. Yes, it's you! You're him! I did hear that you were dead. I didn't know you'd end up here. Who is this guy? Do you know him? You know, he's that athlete! The baseball player, Gang Bin! Gang Bin! -Gang Bin! -Come on! -You were good at stealing bases! -It's Gang Bin! -I wanted to ask you. -Everyone, come on out! -He's an excellent baseball player! -Seriously. Guys, come on out! -Everyone, come and see! -My gosh, look at you. -Guys! -This is Gang Bin! He's here! -Hurry up! -My gosh, it's Gang Bin. -I can't believe this. -Gang Bin! -He's really here. -He's so tall. -Come on here. Look. -This is awesome. -It's Gang Bin. -Gang Bin. -Gang Bin is here? -It's Gang Bin. Gang Bin is here. Hey, come over here. -Hey, he's a celebrity. -He looks just like on TV. -Nice! -He's handsome. It's Gang Bin! -I'm a fan. -Hey, Gang Bin. -It's Gang Bin. -Where are you going? -Where are you going? -Hey. -My gosh. -Oh, no. It's my first time seeing an athlete. It's nice to meet you here. Hey, say hi. -Nice to meet you. -Hello. -Hi. -Hello. He's got an awful case of the syndrome for an athlete. -What syndrome is it? -Celebrity Syndrome. What? GANG SANG-BONG You even had a stage name? His real name is Gang Sang-bong. Gang Bin is such a fake name. You're not Won Bin, Hyun Bin, or Kim Woo-bin. Look at him. This awesome celebrity is joining us. But how did you end up here? You're young to be here. He killed himself. The story about his suicide was all over the news. You killed yourself? Damn it. You hang out with her. Hello. I killed myself too. -Oh, no. -Gosh. Is she okay? Are you all right? What's this? Who mopped the floor and made it so clean? Well, the living don't stay here. It's clean since no one comes here. Did you break your bottom? My gosh, you should have gone easy on yourself. Why act all flashy? Good. Everyone is here. Is this the guy? He won't make a scene since it was suicide. Well, we don't make a scene, either. By the way, did Mr. Choe leave after saying goodbye to his family? As if that's true. -Come on out. -What? What? Why is Mr. Choe still here? He said he would leave if he met with his family for the last time. -Right. -My gosh. ANCESTRAL RITES FOR CHOE REST IN PEACE He must've seen it somewhere. He went to say one last goodbye. Everyone, it's me. I'm leaving now. Live a good life. I was happy thanks to you guys. And thank you. My dear daughter-in-law. I'll miss your soup. You punk. Be nice to your wife. My dear second daughter-in-law. Thank you for hard work, too. I love... A wet wipe, please. Where did this butterfly come from? Those brats killed their father twice. Hey. Why are you crying? I already wrote up a report that you were leaving. It's me who wants to cry now. The same goes for you guys. I know that you guys are ghosts. But please keep your promises. My district is the only one with a zero percent accomplishment. Zero! Well... How can my number be a zero? Does this even make sense to you? Where do you think you're going? I wasn't going anywhere. I was just coming back home. Does she have eyes on the back of her head? What did you say? Okay. I won't run away from you. Okay? Let go of me. Come on, let go of me. We can talk after you let me go. -Let go of me! -Goodness. Is that how you want to play this? -Come on! -Chill! Stop it. Come on. Seriously? It's not our fault your number is a zero! It's all because of that reincarnation cycle policy from above. It's because of that weird policy you guys made. Don't you know we live in the world of democracy? She's right. Yu-ri has a point! Times have changed. -I agree! -That's right. I agree! There are fewer people in this world because you won't leave and reincarnate. The number of ghosts skyrocketed. All I see on the street are ghosts! It's already packed here! Do you still think the policy doesn't make sense? If that's what you were going to do, why give us democracy, to begin with? You could have sent the Grim Reapers and taken all of us against our will. You said ghosts also have rights. So you told us to choose whether we'd stay here or get reincarnated. But now you are telling us to go up because the population is decreasing? Deities are no different than humans. When there's a new power group, policies always get changed. -Those policies always change. -Exactly my point. You'll be punished for that! How dare you run your mouth like that? I'm sure they have their reasons. The higher-ups-- Reasons, my ass! Let's be honest. Who would want to go up there when they die? Her son's business failed, so he comes here and cries every day. And she's deeply worried because her daughter relapsed back to cancer. It's not a good time for everyone to leave. I'm sure you know that! Let's go. -Let's go. -Let's get going. See? You always hurt our feelings. Then, why can't you go? Your husband remarried. You've got nothing to worry about. You think I don't know you want to be with your daughter? Well, am I not allowed to do that? She's my daughter! I want to stay by my daughter! That little... All she can do is talk! How many times must I tell you you shouldn't stay by a child? Let's not make this difficult and go up without a fuss! CHA YU-RI Fine. Being dead is already unfair. I know it's hard for you to leave behind your baby. Poor things. CHA YU-RI Goodness. CHA YU-RI Oh, my. Good morning, everyone. You must be over the moon since it's your death anniversary. Your stomach is in for a treat. I know, right? I hope I don't upset my stomach. Is today her death anniversary? Gosh, I'm so jealous. I have six months to go until mine. Well, she's in for more than just a treat on her death anniversary. SEO-WOO'S BIRTHDAY This washes away toxic words spoken by the mouth This is for the gods in five directions I would love to have a sip of alcohol right about now. Can you tell the monk for me? Gosh. ANCESTRAL RITES FOR CHA REST IN PEACE Goodness. I'm stuffed. Gosh. I'm about to throw up. Why was she in such a rush to leave, my baby? My poor daughter. Gosh, why are you crying, Dad? Why would you feel sorry for her? You cry about everything. She left this world before her parents. She doesn't deserve pity. Stop crying. Let's clean up and go home. I know, Mom. I'm sorry. But don't be so harsh on Dad... Mom, did you wash your face? I'm so sleepy. I'll be in the passenger seat. I can't doze off there. Will she be happy or disappointed that her husband remarried? Don't you know how Yu-ri was? She won't be disappointed. She'd be happy for him. True. Mom, you should go easy on Gang-hwa at least on her death anniversary. Shut it! He's not our family anymore. He's living a good life now. Why would he come here? Hurry. Ma'am, you might be experiencing shortness of breath due to micro-dust. Ma'am, you must wear masks when you go out. Everything looks fine. Let's talk when the results come out. They both had the endoscopy under anesthesia. But his wife woke up from anesthesia first. Without knowing that, he kept calling out his mistress' name. -"Mi-jin." -My gosh. Guess what the wife said after hearing it. -What did she say? -"Scalpel." Seriously? BRIGHT HAEMIL KINDERGARTEN It's Seo-woo. What? What is it this time? All right. You may go on with your days. What? I thought you felt bad for me. Why are you doing this? You only heard what you wanted to hear. Didn't you hear me say about being by a kid? She's not just a kid. She's my daughter. Whether she's your daughter or not, you should not stay with her. Come on. Are you seriously going to tie me up here? -Untie me. Untie me right now! -Why are you getting mad at me? -What? I didn't say anything wrong! -How dare you? You think you're so powerful. You're nothing without those bells! No! That's not true! My goodness, you never listen to me. You are so frustrating! Gosh. Oh, no. Poor you. An evil spirit latched onto your family and won't leave you guys! Have you gone mad? This will be enough to keep that spirit away from you. It's 200,000 won. I accept card payments. Unbelievable. Are you here to make money off me? I dare you to write one for them. Hello. Are you... No, it's fine. -Let's go. -Hold on a second. This isn't over. What... Oh, lord. Why are you here? I requested to be on night duty tonight. Did you not see the log? It got switched to me. -Really? -Yes. You can go. I'll do it. My gosh, that's all right. You should go home. Go when you can. Go before I change my mind. I might just kick you out of here. Have a good night. Go home. Your daughter must be waiting. A patient is seizing in the ICU. -Hey. -Move out of my way. I guess Dad won't be coming home today. Let's have the cake first. No. Then, shall we wait a bit more? Dad wished you a happy birthday. Happy birthday, my dear Seo-woo. That jerk. Again? Come on out when I ask nicely. Or else I'll beat you up. I'll punch you twice if I find you. Really? You're not going to come out? Show yourself. You'd better come out. Come out now. I knew it. You ran when you saw me, right? I clearly told you not to set foot in this house. Well, you can't tell a local spirit to leave his land. -Where should I go? -This isn't your land! It's my daughter's! Go find your remains. Well, I don't know where they are. I lost them. What? How? But still. You can't stay here. That's your problem. Kids have such weak energy. -If you stay, you'll soak up her energy. -In that case, the same applies to you. Do you think you're a human? -What? -In my opinion, you're a bigger problem than me. Soon, she might have to be possessed by you. She can see us. You lunatic! I've been lenient because I felt bad for you. You think you can say whatever you want? Goodness. How dare he say such nonsense? Are you up, Seo-woo? Seo-woo. Yes? Did you sleep well, Seo-woo? Do you want some water? Come here. Let's go. I think Seo-woo can see me. It's because of me, right? Well, children have weak energy. But I've been next to her ever since she was born. It is my fault. You should have told me. I recently found out. I told you that you shouldn't stay next to a child. I caused this. It's because I'm a ghost. It's all my fault. You stayed with her because you were a mom first. Seo-woo. What should I do with Seo-woo now? If she can already sense and see you, ghosts will know and swarm around her. Since she's still a kid, she can't tell humans and ghosts apart. So she might be in bigger danger. Seo-woo! -Catch me. -Seo-woo! Where did she go? You haven't seen her, right? Where did she go? Seo-woo. Where did she go? Seo-woo. Cho Seo-woo. Where are you, Seo-woo? Seo-woo. Seo-woo! She's not here. I swear she was playing right here. It's like a ghost is pranking. She's not upstairs. What's wrong? What happened to Seo-woo? Let's spread out and look for her a bit more. -Then, we'll call the police. Okay? -Okay. Seo-woo. Seo-woo! Seo-woo! She's not there? She's not here. Seo-woo! All right, everyone. Gather round. I made this one. No, the one next to it. Since she's still a kid, she can't tell humans and ghosts apart. So she might be in bigger danger. Seo-woo. Seo-woo! Seo-woo... Oh, no. Over here! She's right here! In there! She's in the fridge! Oh, gosh. Can you hurry and get her out? Oh, no. Seo-woo. Seo-woo. Seo-woo. Seo-woo! Goodness, Seo-woo. She's here! Seo-woo is here! Goodness. -Where is she? -She's right here. -Seo-woo. -Goodness. Seo-woo. EMERGENCY CENTER Seo-woo collapsed. Take a look! She's all right, isn't she? Seo-woo is okay, right? Why would she go into the freezer all by herself? Well... Kids don't even know where the kitchen is. I have no idea how she found the place and got in there all by herself. I'm sorry. It's my fault. Mommy is sorry. You're going up? I'll leave. I'll go. I'll disappear. Then Seo-woo will be fine, won't she? She won't have to see ghosts. I don't know that for sure. I'll go up there and beg. I don't have to be reincarnated. I'm willing to fall under. I just... I was going to leave after I see her walking. I just wanted to see her walk. PARENTS: CHA YU-RI, CHO GANG-HWA Then I wanted to see her talk, run, and eat. I knew I had to go. But I wanted to stay just a little longer. Just a little longer... Mom! Su-ah, gosh, my daughter. Did you do well today? -Of course, I did. -Really? Why? Why not? Why can't I do that? Why can't I? Can't I just stay and watch her? Am I not allowed to have that? Why can't I do that? Why not? Who do you think you are? Who gave you the right to do that? CHA YU-RI You said I can stay! You told me that I can stay here! Why not? Why can't I stay? Do you call yourself a deity? Does that mean you can do anything? How can you be a deity? You jerk! We could just have some sujebi on the weekend. Sujebi isn't easy to make. There wasn't even a potato at home. I needed to shop for groceries anyway. What are you doing? Come along. Yes, I'm coming. Let's go. I'm starving. What's with Dad? Hey. It's because he's too weak. He's way too weak-hearted. You're right. I can't do it. I'm sure you can do anything you put your mind to, but I can't do that. I miss my daughter and my granddaughter! It's not that easy to stay determined! He saw Seo-woo again, didn't he? That's why I suggested we move. At least we won't have to see her. Go back to your room too. You're distracting me. Yes. Yu-ri. Yu-ri... Yu-ri... Yu-ri! Why is this cold? I can see myself! Wait, did I just become a human? But why? All of a sudden? If you see them, ignore them. Don't let other ghosts catch you. I'm sure there are people who look awfully alike, who look like twins. -Are you out of it? -Wait, what is this? Have you ever seen a doppelganger? If you return to your place within 49 days, you can continue to stay alive. Hey, Seo-woo.
