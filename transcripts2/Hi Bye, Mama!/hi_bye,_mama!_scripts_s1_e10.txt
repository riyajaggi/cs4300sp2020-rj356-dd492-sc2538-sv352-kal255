 OH MIN-JEONG -You're applying to nursing school? -Yes. With your grades, it'll be difficult to get in. From now on, I'll study... really hard. Quit? Why? After we marry, I'll have to look after Seo-woo, and I want a break from work. No, Min-jeong. It's okay. I'll keep taking Seo-woo to daycare myself,

 and use the pick-up helper. Don't worry. You can do whatever you want. It's okay, really. It's not okay for me. I can do it. So let me. Let me be Seo-woo's real mom. Back then, I was cocky enough to think that  there was nothing I couldn't achieve with effort and passion. You are up. Open wide. Yummy, right? Open wide.

 Good girl. Do you want to try this too? BRIGHT HAEMIL KINDERGARTEN -Hello. -Hello. I'll take that. Hi, Seo-woo. All right. There. Bye, ma'am. Bye, Mommy. Let's go. Don't you think Seo-woo doesn't look like her mom? She isn't her real mom. She's her stepmom. -Really? -Yes. I knew it. How did you find out? But there is a place in life that I can't achieve or reach with my efforts and enthusiasm alone. Are you her guardian? Her temperature is back to normal. EPISODE 10: YOUR PLACE WHERE I CANNOT REACH All right, all done. I've peeled it all. Let's go. -Gang-hwa! -You! Why you... Wait... Stop! Stop it! Guys, wait. Please stop. Hey! It's Hyeon-jeong. It's her. My Hyeon-jeong! It's my Hyeon-jeong! Hyeon-jeong, help me! Who are you guys? Who the hell are you? Just be on your way. Me? I'm the master of the owner of that car you ruined. I'll make it short. Get lost. There she is. Bruce Lee of Yeouido. YEOUIDO BRUCE LEE What? I told you to leave, lady! Hey, throw the eggs. Throw them! -Hey! -Oh. Girls, run away. You stupid fans. Are you okay? Goodness. She's going to kill them. Don't you dare. -Hey. -Yes. -Yes. -Just because a doctor writes a lot of social media posts doesn't mean he doesn't do his job right. -Of course not. -No. Don't ever come back. Answer me. Don't come again, okay? Okay! Does your mom know about this? -No. -Honey. Never again. Okay? Don't cry. You're crazy. You're out of your mind! Gang-hwa, that idiot. He must have a hollow leg. Why did he have to eat that? Why did you eat that? Well, I thought it was just a scribble. I didn't think it was a drawing. For a six-year-old, a scribble is a drawing. Exactly. You're exactly right. She drew so well. Anyway, she was... She didn't have to get mad like that. She even yelled at you. It was something to get mad about. Of course, it was. If I were her, I would've gotten mad, too. I would've done more than just yell. I would've cursed probably. How could you eat it then? Exactly. I know. Yeouido Bruce Lee. Yeouido Bruce Lee isn't dead yet. You only needed three eggs. You finished them all. Finished them all, my foot. Before I finish you, you better explain. Yes, ma'am. So, they're acting like that because you didn't counsel Kang Bin well. Right. He wasn't depressed. He was normal. I checked many times. Then why did he kill himself? It looks like a suicide. Wasn't he under investigation for match-fixing? Yes. They found his suicide note, too. Gosh. I don't understand. You're still here. Yes. Okay. Doctor Gye. Yes? Can't you diagnose me with depression... or manic depression? No. Because you don't have those. Right. What? My club wants it. Just for show, you know. If I do that, I'll have to show my face on the 9 o'clock news. Never mind then. Guess I came here for nothing. He didn't show any signs of suicide. What really happened? KANG BIN, I LOVE YOU KANG SANG-BONG She's been coming here every day. Of course. Her son died. She must be inconsolable. Stay away from my mom! Don't stand too close! My goodness. I guess he's worried about his mom. -Leave! -Goodness. -This is absurd. -Let's go. -Let's leave. -We won't hurt her. -My goodness. -Gosh. I'M SORRY. MOMMY'S SORRY, SON "'Of course. I'll go all the way to the end of the world, then return home.' The baby bear said this in Mommy bear's arms as he closed his eyes softly." BABY BEAR WHO WENT TO TOUCH THE MOON What are you doing over there? She says I'm nice. Isn't that weird? But I feel like Yu-ri has known Min-jeong for a long time. Is it just me? Is Seo-woo asleep? Yes. Min-jeong. Yes? The pick-up helper, when did you first see her? Well... The day we saw her together at the daycare. Seo-woo. Gang-hwa. I see. We saw her for the first time there, together. Yes. That's right. We did. What about her? Should we find someone else? Oh, no. Why would we find someone else? Because she looks so much like Seo-woo's mom. I knew you'd be bothered by that. I don't know. I'm drawn to her. I guess it's because she looks like Seo-woo's mom. Min-jeong. You're Seo-woo's mom, too. Yes, that's right. You should go to bed. I haven't done anything, but half of my days are gone already. Gosh, why does time go by so quickly? It went by so slowly when I was a ghost though. Is this what you've been hiding? That you'll die again in 49 days? You can live. You just have to take your place back. So why? Yu-ri? -Yeon-ji. -Yes? Where did your sister go? She went out this morning. Where to? I don't know. I only saw her leave. Where does she keep going to? Where did everything go? The front door pin number is 0222. Please play with her at home after daycare. You're dead. They're gone. Thanks to Chairman Baek and Mr. Kim, you avoided zero track record. Anyway, I wonder if they went up there safely. Of course, they did. You guys should go up, too. It'd be nice to go up there and be born again. Gwi-sun. I'm hard of hearing these days, and my vision's blurry. -All of a sudden? -What? Do you have a hearing problem? Me, too. Let me go with you. Where are you going? Yeong-sim! What... Where are you guys going? Damn it. Gosh. I guess you've been chewed on recently. You are nagging us more frequently. What? You guys get to stay here because I'm in charge of this area. With this performance, I might be replaced with a new shaman. I know that. If we didn't have you, we would've been sent up there by now. Once things get better for my son, I promise I'll go up there. Damn it. Enough of your son. I will just send you right away... What? Why? -Isn't it in there? -Gosh, she did it again. Damn it. Cha Yu-ri! I will have it out with the damn ghost today. He should go to his remains. What is that moron doing here? Oh, right. He lost his remains. What an idiot. Why would he lose his remains in the first place? Anyway, I'm going to teach him a lesson. Gosh, where is the punk hiding? I'm sure he's somewhere in here. Go tuck Seo-woo in. She might catch a cold. Seo-woo kicked off the covers. Why don't you go to Seo-woo's room? Hey, you should go check Seo-woo. Go to her room and tuck her in. I don't want her to catch a cold. That's right. This way. Get into the room. Go to Seo-woo's room. This way. Hey! Damn it. Hey, you want to go to Seo-woo's room. Go ahead and get into the room. Hurry. Go in. To Seo-woo's room... I can't believe this. Damn it. I'm sure he came this way. What? He's not in here. Damn it. I lost him again. -I got you. -What? Who are you? I guess this is why Ms. Mi-dong likes to shake the bells. It just feels great. Why do you have that thing? None of your business. I told you not to stay here. Why are you still hovering around here? -This is all your fault. -Damn it. Who are you? Are you a shaman? Let go of me. Who is she? Who are you? I knew there was someone else in this house. Why is this place full of ghosts? Hey, who are you? How long have you been here? Are you a local ghost? A local ghost? Don't you dare compare me to that idiot. -Damn it. -Me? I'm a virgin ghost. I thought I finally found a guy whom I could satisfy my desire with. Since he's married, I don't even have to seduce him. But that damn wench... My gosh, there's something different about him. One. Two. Three... It's over. Gosh. Don't put it on. I'll be right there. Wait for me. Let me borrow your body. Gosh, I slipped. What was that? What's wrong? His wife is so strong-minded that it's hard to possess her. Damn it. Gosh, I'm not the problem. She is. You should take her. How dare you try to sponge off Gang-hwa? What? Gang-hwa? Who are you? Are you his mother? -Or his sister? -Why do you even care? I just can't take this anymore. How dare you show your faces around here? Why are you so upset, pretty lady? You know what? You're really pretty. Can I borrow your body just for a day? What? -Please? -What is she talking about? SEAWEED FROM WAN ISLAND Yu-ri. Mom. Mom. THREE TIMES A DAY, THIRTY MINUTES AFTER MEALS Mom. Do you think Yu-ri got rid of Seo-woo's stuff? Yes. Do you think she saw Seo-woo? I think Gang-hwa knew that she came back to life all along. So I wonder if he let her meet Seo-woo. -Take it. -Make them take one. I'm warning you. Something crazy is about to happen. Gang-hwa. Yeon-ji. -Is everything okay? -It looks like something happened to you. Did you guys have a visitor? It's... Well... He's married now. There's nothing we can do about him. But Seo-woo is different. She's Yu-ri's kid. Mom, where are you going? Bean sprout soup. -Good for you. -Why? You drink it every day. My gosh. And... Gosh. Damn it. I'm not eating it. I don't want to eat eggs! Those damn eggs! Chicken eggs. I hate them! I will eat stir-fried spicy pork though. -What's wrong with him? -Doctor. -Yes? -What's wrong? Nothing. Min-jeong likes her because she looks like Yu-ri? Did Min-jeong really say that? Yes. What's in her head? She's supposed to hate your dead wife's look-alike. She wouldn't want to be involved. My point. Hey. Is Min-jeong by any chance... a pervert? How dare you say such a thing, you idiot? I'm just kidding. I just find it strange. It's strange that Yu-ri knew Min-jeong. Min-jeong is being weird too. Gosh, everything's so ridiculous. You're the one who's ridiculous. I'm just saying that because I worry about you. Hey. Just finish your meal and go to therapy. Doctor Jang is coming back from the seminar today. He'll fret and fume again. -I'm back. -You startled me. My gosh. Doctor Jang, you're here. Did the seminar go well? Do you even care about my seminar, you fool? Gosh. The kitchen of the kindergarten? Yes. And she works as a pick-up helper for Seo-woo. I expected she would try to see Seo-woo. But a pick-up helper? Gosh. Does your wife know about it? No. Yu-ri asked me not to tell her. So my wife thinks she's just someone who looks like Yu-ri. She's seen Yu-ri's picture before. I'm sorry. I should... I will have to do something... What can you do? -Pardon? -There's nothing you can do. I knew you'd be like this. That's why I came here. I was worried. Now that Yu-ri's back, you can't just take Seo-woo from your wife for her. Your wife is... Seo-woo's mom, too. Right. Whether she works in the kitchen or as a pick-up helper, I'm just glad that she gets to see Seo-woo. Let's just take some time to think about it. It's not something you can handle on your own. I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner. Raise your head. Why would you apologize? I'm sorry. I really am. Don't touch it. Mom. Leave it there. It's for your sister. Don't touch it. It's moldy. I'm sorry, Mother. Why do you apologize? I'm sorry. I really am. I'm sorry, Mother. I'm sorry, Mother. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I'm sorry. SEO-WOO AT A KIDS' CAFE FAMILY PICNIC -Come here. -My gosh. It really hurts. It hurts. Let go of me. Wait. Gosh, where are we going? If I let you go now, you'll show up here again. I should tie you up so you can't move around. I've been trying hard to avoid Seobinggo. Where did she come from all of a sudden? What? You fool. -My gosh. -Where are you running off to? -I'm sorry. -You're here. Cha Yu-ri! You wench. How dare you tell me to come and go? When did you take my bells? What is this thing? -Who is she? -What? I told you on the phone. She's a virgin ghost, nowhere to go. It will help you improve your performance. My gosh. Are you selling me off now? What a shitty world. What? -Are you a shaman? -Yes. Peek-a-boo. Look who's here. So we finally meet. Hey, it's been a really long time. I heard you've been busy trying to hunt me down. So you lost some weight. Good for you. What? Wait. Stop right there, you brat! Who is she? Never mind. She used to be a good shaman, but she's having a hard time because of some troublesome virgin ghost. She's been looking for a virgin ghost, so I brought her. My gosh. I guess it was her. Oh, right. Did you kick out the local ghost? I sent him someplace else. It will be hard for him to settle in unless the new place is haunted. He settled down here because you kept coming in and out of this place in the first place. So? Where did he go? There's a place crowded with ghosts. I've never seen you before. Where are you from? It doesn't matter. What are you doing in my son's place? Well... It's not like that. Someone sent me here. -I don't care. Get lost! -Who sent you here? -Go away! -How dare you come here? You idiot. Gosh, wait. Let go of me. -How dare you? -Wait. Don't you dare come here again. So you took care of a local ghost. Are you going to kindergarten? Yes. To pick Seo-woo up. I can stay around her all day now. I will stop all the ghosts from coming near her. You're unbelievable. Then Seo-woo won't be seeing ghosts anymore, right? What? I think so. I guess so. Why do you sound so evasive? I've been counting the days. I have only a few days left. I have to make sure she doesn't see them. It wouldn't hurt to see some ghosts. You're a ghost, too. Are you crazy? Take it back right now. What are you waiting for? Happy now? So I wonder... What if... What if... Seo-woo keeps seeing ghosts? What will happen? It's nothing serious. She will be just like me. A shaman? That can't be right. I can't let it happen. MOTHERS OF SUNSHINE CLASS There's a fraud who sells fake home-school materials in front of the kindergarten. Be careful. MOTHERS OF SUNSHINE CLASS Who would fall for such a fraud? We're not fools. We will be okay. Then I will have one set of writing materials. This one? Okay. So you have an experienced eye. With these books, your child will soon begin to speak. -Are you sure? -Yes. Late talkers are caused by not having home-study materials. Seo-woo studied a lot with those materials. Then I will have another set of these too. -This one as well? -Yes. You're a great mother. All right. Here you are. -Thank you. -Have a nice day. Kitchen staff. A pick-up helper. Are you happy to see your kid like that? Yes. I'm just thankful. Just tell me the reason. Why are you being like this? Why... Why do you want to die? Seo-woo sees... ghosts. What? What does she see? Ghosts. What are you talking about? I was a ghost. You said... you didn't remember anything. You said you just woke up at the charnel house. I was a ghost for five years. I was around Seo-woo the whole time. For five years. Because of me, Seo-woo sees... Is that why... Seo-woo sees ghosts? The ghosts that I know? Hyeon-jeong. I don't want anything else. You're a mom. You know how I feel. I'm dead already. And I have no regrets. Just let me take care of what I did before I leave. There was... nothing I could do for Seo-woo. This is the only thing I can do for Seo-woo, you know? Seo-woo is going through all this because of me. It's all my fault. What's all this? Did she ask you to cook bracken? -Yes. -Yu-ri doesn't eat bracken. Gang-hwa didn't like it either. I know. It's strange. She took all of it. I guess it wasn't for her. This kimchi is new. I got it from someone. I see. Who? How is it? It tastes healthy. A little bland. It tastes somewhat familiar. I made new side dishes. Do you like them? -They are too bland. -I agree. This is bland, too. Bland tasting foods are good for your health. -Don't eat them. -Why would you do that? You can't do that while we eat. What? The pick-up helper. I got it from her. I wanted to eat this. You don't like bracken, do you? No. You like it though. Right. So did you know the whole thing about Min-jeong? Yes. I know her well. You're done. Let's watch TV. Oh, no. Seo-woo, you spilled everything. Again? At first, I just wanted to watch Seo-woo for a little longer. Why don't you try to become friends with the other kids' moms? I know they can be quite rude, but wouldn't it be better than being alone all the time? Thank you for today. Should I make some seasoned bracken tomorrow? No, thank you. My husband doesn't like it. Ask her to make it. You love bracken. You're too nice. After a while, I ended up knowing better than anyone else just how nice Min-jeong is. She sure is nice. I wish she was a mean person. -Hyeon-jeong. -Yes? I've never been more grateful to anyone else in my life. I've been watching everything right next to her. I'll never be able to pay her back even after I die. She sure is the spitting image of Yu-ri. So please try to understand. Wait, Yu-ri. If you don't stop, I'll just go up right now. They're fake. What are you talking about? HOME-SCHOOL MATERIALS What? No way. -I paid 350,000 won for them. -You're crazy. They're supposed to make a cooing baby talk. My goodness. You bought all this? They're fake. -My gosh. -That bastard. How many are there? Hello. Do you want to have a drink with me? What? MISAENG I'm here... Leaving. What's going on? What did I just see? What's with you? Are you coming in or not? I can't stay here. Why are the three of them here together? I just wanted to thank you for the side dishes. This was the only way I could think of. You two like drinking, don't you? I think you like it more than we do. You're right. I guess you two really are close. You were together again. Oh, do you want me to leave you two alone? No, not at all. I'm just envious. Since I got married, I've had no friends. I pushed everyone away. I knew it. -Sorry? -Nothing. I wanted to become friends with you, but Gang-hwa seemed uncomfortable. He did? That's understandable. Gosh. Why isn't he here yet? What is it? What's the matter? Gosh, you startled me! Hey, Gang-hwa. Gang-hwa. -Gang-hwa. -Get off me. Gang-hwa. I had no idea things would get this bad. I had no idea I'd have to meet you in the middle of the night. -Guess who's at my diner right now. -Who is it? A celebrity or something? A celebrity, my foot. Hyeon-jeong, Yu-ri... So what? -and Min-jeong. -What? What is Min-jeong doing there? Are you going out? I have to meet someone. Go to bed. Who? A friend. Do I make you uncomfortable? What do you mean? You were very close to Seo-woo's mom, Yu-ri. Well, why would I feel uncomfortable? I feel grateful. I really do. I guess you two were really close. Does this person over here make you uncomfortable? No, she doesn't. I'm just... curious. Like I'm curious about Seo-woo's mom. Since I got married, I've only seen a photo of her. At first, I thought, "So this is what she looked like." And then I wondered what kind of person she was, how she talked, and what kind of thoughts she had. I became more and more curious because Gang-hwa would never tell me anything. So when I see her, I wonder if Seo-woo's mom was like her. I'm sorry. You might not know this, but I'm not Seo-woo's real mom. I'm making you uncomfortable. Let's drink. Okay. Gang-hwa, that jerk. I'm 100 percent sure it's Gang-hwa's fault. I agree. -Right? -That bastard. Listen. -I mean, why? -Exactly. Why wouldn't he tell you anything? He's only making you more curious. -That's what I'm talking about. -Yes. Does he think I'd get jealous of a dead person or something? -I know. -He's always like that. Thinking he's being thoughtful, he keeps everything to himself and decides everything on his own. Gosh, unbelievable. That's exactly what I think. -By the way... -Oh, my. do you know my husband well? What? No, I don't. I don't. She doesn't. Anyway, you look... just like Seo-woo. I'm jealous. You know what? All stepmoms in fairytales are evil. Why? Why? Why are they all evil? Just because they're stepmoms? Stepmoms are moms, too. But why do they have to be evil? I was faster. Gosh, you're incredible. My goodness. Good job. -I did a good job, didn't I? -You did. You saved her. My gosh. Hyeon-jeong must be out of her mind. She wants them to be friends? Are they going to be best friends now? She's crazy. She completely lost her mind. Gosh, you're distracting me. Sit down. You're the biggest problem here. Why did you let Yu-ri be your pick-up helper? You obviously want to screw up your life. HYEON-JEONG My bestie. You're my bestie now. -All right. -What? Hey, she's my bestie! She's mine! She's mine. -No, she's mine! -Hey! -Fine, I get it. -She's my bestie. Let go on three, you both. One, two, three. Did you let go? -Let go! -She's mine! Don't take her from me! All right. Gosh, that hurts. That really hurts. Unbelievable. -I can't believe what I'm seeing. -Fine, I get it. -Do you see that, too? -Don't take her away. That's enough. Pull yourself together. That's enough. I get it. Gang-hwa. My husband is here. Hyeon-jeong. -You're mine. -What happened to these two? -Well... -Why did you let them drink so much? I drank the most. I need to pee. Gang-hwa, take Min-jeong home. -What about Yu-ri? -I'll take care of her. You're mine, Hyeon-jeong. I get it, I get it. Min-jeong, let's go home. Take my arm. Hold here, honey. I got you. Let's go. Hyeon-jeong, please make sure Yu-ri is okay. Don't worry and go home. Gosh, you drink too much. -The thing is-- -Cut it out. Come inside. Geun-sang. Geun-sang! Wait... Yu-ri. Hyeon-jeong. -Yu-ri. -I'm so happy. She can't stop sighing. What happened? Her son must have been here. That must be it. Every time her son visits here, she sits there for hours, sighing constantly. Even if her son was doing well, it wouldn't be easy for her to go up. Even after you die, your children will always be your homework. JANG-HWA AND HONG-RYEON CINDERELLA KONG-JWI AND PAT-JWI ANTS SHIM-CHEONG SNOW WHITE What are these? These books limit children's imagination. -Pardon? -"Stepmoms are evil and out to get you. All children with stepmoms should be pitied." That's what these books teach children. They make all stepmoms look like bad people. I see. I guess you have a point. So they should be put away, right? Pardon? HOME-SCHOOL MATERIALS You bought them? They're fake. I already told her. I bought them for Seo-woo. For Seo-woo? I see. They can make a cooing baby talk? That's nonsense. What kind of moms fall for that? You don't have to give them to me. I already have them. I was also tricked into buying them... last year. EASY HANGUL EASY HANGUL Hey. Min-jeong seems to get wasted every time she drinks. Is she okay? Yes. How is Yu-ri? She seemed very drunk last night. What? Well... Yu-ri doesn't get drunk easily. So how much did she drink to get so wasted? She wasn't drunk. What are you talking about? She was dead drunk. She sobered up when Gang-hwa showed up. No way. Are you drunk? Are you saying she pretended to be drunk... Why does everything have to be... so sad between those two? Of course, she's fine. Come in. -Hello. -What's the matter? Can you sign this? What is it? PETITION AGAINST PRIORITIZING VIP PATIENTS I'll pass. I'm not supposed to sign any petitions while on suspension, you fool. We've been working on this for three months. Please sign it. If things could change so easily, they already would have. All right. Hey. Leave him out. Do you want me to sign it? -I'll sign it. -You already did. I did? I can do it again. I love signing petitions. Again, Doctor Cho is the only one who didn't sign it. She might die. I said "no." Send her over. I can do this. Why aren't you letting me do it? I can save her, Doctor. INSOMNIA, HYPERAROUSAL, HAND TREMORS... It's just like Doctor Gye's diagnosis. Claustrophobia in operating rooms. Is his treatment going well? Yes. So why wasn't he treated... earlier? You still can't do surgery? Why are you surprised? I visit this hospital now and then. There's a way to find out things. Are you still scared of operating rooms? Yes. Why? I thought you were getting better. You were moving on. You even got married again. -Yes. -Then why haven't you been treated? I feel guilty. About what? About getting better. I feel too guilty. He felt guilty. The more stable his new marriage got, the guiltier he would've felt. Even while laughing and feeling happy, he would've felt a sudden pang of guilt. I think he didn't seek help earlier because his symptoms were the only reminder of what happened. He didn't want to forget everything. I can't believe we ran out of salt. Still, I'd rather go to the supermarket than peel carrots. Definitely. YU-RI Hi, Yu-ri. Gang-hwa. -My goodness. -Hello? Yu-ri, what's wrong? A car accident. Send her to the ER. Hello? Yu-ri! Yu-ri! What happened? What is it? Gang-hwa, where are you going? -Doctor Cho. -Yes? Your wife... had an accident. A shaman? That can't be right. I can't let it happen. What's so wrong with being a shaman? It's a way of living. What are you doing here? I never heard back from you, so I came here... to get her. I've been watching everything right next to her. I'll never be able to pay her back even after I die. You don't want to live? You don't want to live at all? I do. I really do, Hyeon-jeong. I can't get out. What should I do? Thank you. Whose house is this? Is it your house? It looks so cute. It's a living room. -Okay. -This is a bathroom. It's a bathroom? Seo-woo. Seo-woo, Hi. Oh, no! Three, four, five. I counted to five. Good job, Seo-woo. You're good at sports, just like me. Come out, come out, wherever you are. Are you done? -Not yet. -Are you done now? -Yes! -I'll start looking for you. I found you! Come out, come out, wherever you are. -Are you done? -Not yet. -No? -Are you here? I found you. Aren't you scared? Are you okay? That's good. Higher and higher. You're flying. Hold my hands. It's scary. Mommy! Did you have fun? What did you do? We played hide-and-seek, doctor, and the airplane game. You played so many games. Seo-woo looks adorable even when she's asleep. Your place where I cannot reach. Mom. I want to be friends with the woman who looks like Yu-ri. She looks like a nice person. How many days does Yu-ri have left? Yu-ri's family. Can't she take her place back? Is it really okay to let them hang out? Min-jeong never liked anyone this much. A success rate of 99.9 percent. All the ghosts have been annihilated.
