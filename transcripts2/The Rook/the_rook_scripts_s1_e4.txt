 ELIZA: Previously on "The Rook"... MYFANWY: "In this envelope, you'll find two keys. "The red key opens a box with everything you need "to return to my old life. The blue key opens a box with a new identity." NARRATOR: This is the quadruplet hive mind, the shared consciousness. MYFANWY: What happened between us... I mean, I know you said it was a mistake. ELIZA: I don't make mistakes. What did you want from me?

 Sell you at auction. AUCTIONEER: Lot number three, sold. GORDON: Here's the drop right now. FARRIER: Grantchester knows. - About my memory? - No, I'm talking about the bridge. ROBERT: I don't know why she protects you. Like it's Bristol all over again. Ask them about Bristol. FARRIER: You're still in danger from yourself. MYFANWY: I need to know who I am. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [PAPERS RUSTLING] Why have you got a cheese label on your wall? I like cheese.

 [PAPERS RUSTLE] Is this a tactic? I don't know what you mean. Having me sit here and watch you read. It's odd. Apologies, your chart only just arrived. I had meant to read it in advance. [PAPERS SHUFFLING] I won't charge you for the visit. I'm sure Her Majesty's Government will have that covered. It was a joke. But yours was better. I'm really not crazy or depressed. Or whatever else it was she said about me. She didn't say you were crazy or depressed. Well, then why am I here? I see you've tried multiple modalities. Sound. Startle response, vasovagal stimulation. None of it works, and I don't know why Linda thinks a psychiatrist is going to help. Emotional balance isn't the Checquy's strong suit, but at some level, they do understand its importance in the big picture. Thing is, I can't do it on command. Ever. It was a fluke. A mistake. Okay. "Okay"? I'm not here to teach you tricks. And honestly, I don't care about your... transdermal neuro-whatever. I'm a therapist. This is your time. Figure out what you want from it. I want to go home. - So go. - Oh, don't fuck with me. Look, what's happened to you is an incredible opportunity. Glengrove House has the potential to change your life in ways I'm sure you can't even begin to dream of.

I took care of the rest, but these are red band, eyes only. - Can I get you anything? - I could murder a coffee. Since when do you drink caffeine? Well, just been nonstop since the bridge. I'll be freebasing cocaine by the end of the week. Oh, I'm gonna need access to the Glengrove House files. Really? Why? A lead on one of the dead Lugat. Of course. I'll contact Archives. - Let me know when they're ready. - Mm-hmm. [TENSE MUSIC] ♪ REPORTER: What was panic and chaos earlier, seems to be dissipating and a large police presence has taken command of the scene. [BUZZING CONTINUES] [PHONE CLATTERS] [BUZZING CONTINUES] ♪ FARRIER: A vehicle transporting an EVA after auction was abandoned, and the cargo went missing. Police have arrested two Russians near the van. Monica's bringing them in for questioning. Why isn't this on the panic lines? I've redesignated it for the time being. And what's Monica got to do with it? [LAUGHS] Ask her. Oh, and turn off the cameras in interrogation. Nobody needs to know about this now. Why the secrecy? Why the questions? If anyone should understand compartmentalization, Gestalt, it's you. Question the Russians, find the EVA, and call me when it's done. ♪ [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [KNOCK ON GLASS] Hope I'm not interrupting. Actually a little snowed under. Can it wait? I've been turning something over in my head, going around and around all night, and I just can't seem to puzzle it out. [SIGHS] Why you? "Why me," what? In all their years of trafficking EVAs, the Lugat have never come after a serving Checquy officer. And then... out of nowhere, they do it three times in three days. And not to kidnap a field agent or an undercover operative... They come for you. Why do you think that is? I can honestly say I have no idea. You never saw these assailants before any of these attacks? - Never. - Never spoke to them alone? - Met in private? - No. But you did speak to Peter... alone. Yesterday, in his cell. After you disabled all the security cameras. I went down there to ask him the same questions that you have. Turns out he just wanted to insult me. Nothing useful. Nothing at all? No, just more antiestablishment ranting. [CHAIR CLATTERS] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] ♪ Myfanwy, if you're in some kind of trouble with the Lugat Syndicate, I flatter myself that I would be able to help. All you would ever have to do is ask. ♪ Archives are ready. Great, I am on my way. We're not done here. Look, I'm really sorry, but I have to go. Believe me, there's nothing more to tell. I'm just as bewildered by all of this as you are. ♪ Okay. ♪ Ms. Thomas? [INQUISITIVE MUSIC] ♪ No food, no drink, no moisture, no heat.

Hi. Um, just doing some research. What are you doing down here? Looking for you. I may have a problem. Depends how we play it. TEDDY: I have to file a report on the Jeep I damaged yesterday. While we were doing... whatever it was we were doing. Cut that out, or I'm gonna have to kick you in all four of your testicles. Does it really take two of you to come down here and ask me a question? The more bodies I have around you, the more it seems to dilute the effect you have on me. I have an effect on you? ALEX: [LAUGHS] It's not funny. I crashed a fucking car. That never happened before. I can either lie to the vehicle depot... Or I could tell them the truth. I was kissing you. You know, I thought I should ask first. Do you... want to come clean? Or do we keep this... unofficial? What do you want? I think if yesterday was anything to go by... [TENSE, INTIMATE MUSIC] You mess with my head. Destroy my ability to... compartmentalize. And if I can't compartmentalize... I can't do my job. ♪ That's a big risk. Maybe we should take it slow.

Hi. It's been a long time. Are you Dr. Andrew Bristol? What? You know me? Um, we know each other? Myfanwy, w-what's going on? I don't know. I was hoping you could help me. Please help me. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Can I come up? It's... it's pure biographical memory loss. No other neurological impairment? Don't think so. And you've absolutely no idea how this happened? Well, I, uh... what I do know is that I was involved in some sort of "Bristol Incident," which, naturally, I assumed occurred in Bristol, and that's pretty much fucked me up. But then I discovered that I was a patient at a vanishing mental hospital that happened to have a Dr. Andrew Bristol on staff. So now I'm thinking it-it's a person; it's you. Why? Because I've got glass birds from this fucking shop all over my flat. [OBJECT CLATTERS] Sorry, um... I sound deranged. About a week ago... [SIGHS] I received this. I didn't open it, but... I did recognize your handwriting. Seems like you knew you'd end up here. I'll be out back. [PAPER RUSTLING] MYFANWY: "Dear you, if you're reading this, "then you've opened a door which is better left closed. "Turn around right now. "Walk away and never look back. "Trust me. Run." [PAPER CRINKLES] [CHIMES TINKLING] What was in your letter? That you are somehow connected to why my memory was erased. [LAUGHS] No, I don't... I need you to tell me everything that happened. Every single thing. [LAUGHS SOFTLY] Does anyone at the Checquy know you're here? Why would that matter? [SIGHS] Fuck. [SIGHS] Okay. It's only fair. Come with me. [CHIMES TINKLING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Where the fuck are you going? To find the missing EVA. You go and eat caviar with your new friends. Yeah, no fucking way. I'm the only one who know what he-she-it is doing. You wouldn't know anything about this EVA if it wasn't for me. The EVA who you watched being sold at an auction... Yeah, that shit was crazy... Then allowed to escape in broad daylight but can't describe. Believe it or not, I was focused on the guys with guns. And at least I was there. I tailed this van through this horrible tangle of streets, and whoever invented roundabouts should be shot. Suffice it to say, I've been ahead of you every step of the way. You got ahead because you were protecting your dead Vulture boyfriend. - [INDISTINCT CHATTER] - [PHONES RINGING] He was not a Vulture. And technically, the seller was Lugat. TEDDY: So Marcus was Lugat. No, he was spying on the Lugat. Ah. When you kidnap EVAs and sell them to the highest bidder, that's not being a spy. That's being a Vulture. MONICA: I'll find him first, and you know it. ALL: Wait. [BIRDS CALLING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] ♪ [INDISTINCT CHATTER] ♪ [SEAGULLS CALLING] ♪ Let's go. ♪ MYFANWY: How long was I your patient for? BRISTOL: About a year and a half. You were having trouble accessing your EVA, and they thought that talking to me might help you sort that out. [BOXES SHUFFLING] [PAPER RUSTLING] What's all that? Remnants of my past. - [BOX CREAKING] - [PAPERS SHUFFLING] Why did you stop practicing? Uh... I guess I got sick of listening to other people's problems all day. [LAUGHS] Isn't that the definition of psychiatry? Well, I somehow thought the work would be more aspirational, like I would be able to... help people tap into their best selves. Naive notion, really. What? Nothing. Found it. Let's take it upstairs, shall we? [FOOTSTEPS ON STAIRS] My aunt died and left me that shop. [GRUNTS] My wife wanted me to get rid of it, I wanted to keep it, so in the end, we compromised. She got rid of me. I took it all as a sign that it was time for a change. Have a seat. [PAPERS RUSTLING] Well, those are my notes on you. Says here I was in quarantine. Yeah, your presenting issue was quite powerful. You knocked out both your parents and a few paramedics. They had no idea what you were capable of. What do you mean, knocked out? - Did I... - Kill them? No, no, no, no, no. But they'd never seen anything like it. So, um, Glengrove was a hospital for EVAs? Well, there was a medical wing, but it was more than that. It was an assessment and training facility for the Checquy. You were their most exciting find in years. [FAINT INDISTINCT CHATTER] [TENSE MUSIC] ♪ [NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE] ♪ ROBERT: The target is male with dark hair and a yellow jacket. Facial recognition's a dead end. We're tracking him manually. - You got a location? - TEDDY: Not yet. He's heading south towards London Bridge. Drive towards the river. Analyze the footage in the two-mile radius. ♪ MYFANWY: [GASPS] ♪ [FOOTSTEPS, SHUFFLING ON TAPE] [BIRD TWEETING] Apparently you have a thing with birds. [CHUCKLES] Well, it's better than rats. BRISTOL: You ready? ♪ Okay, go. ♪ MYFANWY: [BREATHES SHAKILY] Told you. Can't do it. BRISTOL: You can. ♪ MYFANWY: [SIGHS] ♪ [BREATHING SHAKILY] [ELECTRICITY CRACKLING] ♪ [BIRD TWEETING] - BRISTOL: Hold it there. - MYFANWY: [GASPS SHAKILY] ♪ BRISTOL: [EXCLAIMS] Incredible. [ELECTRICITY CRACKLING] [BIRD TWEETING] ♪ [BOTH LAUGHING] BRISTOL: You fucking rock star. MYFANWY: [GASPS] [PANTING] ♪ Look, I know that looks, uh, weird, but given that your EVA had presented after a fall, we thought it might have been triggered by physical pain. Was it? It was a theory, but it didn't hold. Pain wasn't the key. So what worked? In the end... [SIGHS] Nothing. But I'm doing it in the video. I mean nothing that stuck. You couldn't reliably deploy, that's... that's why you're a bureaucrat. [TENSE MUSIC] ♪ [SIGHS] ♪ What's with the cheese poster? [LAUGHS SOFTLY] You hungry? Sure. Double espresso. Thank you. - Why do you do that? - Do what? Pretend to have different tastes in coffee. I mean, it's all you, right? Why the pretense? The illusion of distinct personalities puts other people at their ease. Which allows me to hide in plain sight. Kinda creeps me out, so, you know, don't do it for my benefit. Understood.

Where is he? Where am I right now? Did you bring me here? Fuck. Oh. [LAUGHS] Hello. CONRAD: Your assistant said you'd be back in a second. I hope you don't mind. Of course not. I went to Myfanwy's apartment this morning. Had a look around. Y-you what? She has a key to a safe deposit box in the Lugat Bank. For fuck's sake, Conrad, what are you doing? I'm trying to get some answers. By breaking into her flat? You're not listening. What is Myfanwy's business with the Lugat? Oh, God, stop jumping to conclusions. It's hardly jumping to conclusions. You've always been her protector. This wouldn't be the first time you've covered for her. Oh, Jesus, Conrad, I'm not covering for anyone. [LAUGHS SOFTLY] Out of respect for our friendship, our years of history working together, I am asking you to be straight with me now. Linda. What the fuck is going on? You can tell me. I could help. Despite our differences, we're supposed to be on the same side. And we are. [FAINT INDISTINCT CHATTER] [SIGHS] You know that... I do appreciate everything that you're saying. And I am grateful for you. But I have honestly told you everything that I know. [TENSE MUSIC] ♪ So I'm a bureaucrat. [SCOFFS] Big deal. Why is it that everyone wants me to forget my past? [BIRDS CHIRPING] Andrew. [CHIMES TINKLING] What is the Bristol Incident? I need some fucking truth. There was a fire. But it was entirely my fault. I should never have been overseeing your EVA development. I'm a psychiatrist. I'm trained to sit in a chair and listen. But Linda Farrier approached me about working with you in this other capacity, and it seemed... [SCOFFS] Fun. It was reckless. Why? What happened? [SIGHS] I was pushing you... too hard, and you got sick of it, we had a fight. A big fight. It triggered your EVA... [CHIMES TINKLING] And it set off a small explosion. And the building burnt to the ground. It was an old building. The sprinklers didn't work properly. Did any... How many? [CHIMES TINKLING] Does it matter? Yes... [LAUGHS] Yeah, it does, 'cause I came here to find out who did this to me, and all I found is more evidence to suggest that I hurt people. I destroy things. I have to take pills to stop myself from blowing things up. Nobody blamed you, nobody. But it affected you very deeply. Life is a string of experiences, and even if they're horrible, they make you who you are. Without that, may as well have died. But you didn't. Myfanwy Thomas is sitting right here across from me. I know you. This is you. [MELANCHOLY MUSIC] ♪ [BELL JINGLES] ♪ I'm surprised Farrier hasn't sent her flying monkeys after you yet. I didn't tell her I was coming. Well, she has a way of knowing these things. Be careful with her. I will. I am. And thank you for today. It's the first time anyone's been willing to tell me anything.

But you were still married when we had our fling. It was more than a fling. Did you ever think about leaving her? You were my patient. It was wrong. That's what we were fighting about... - that night. - The night of the fire? I tried to break up with you. I will never forget the look on your face... The anger, hurt. It caused people on the other side of the wall to collapse. You'd never done anything like that before. [FAINT INDISTINCT CHATTER] [SIGHS] It was an experiment that got out of hand. What do you mean, an experiment? Linda noticed that... your abilities seemed enhanced when I was around. Classic transference. A crush. Normally harmless, easily dealt with. But in your case, the emotions were doing something powerful for you. So on her directive... [SWALLOWS] I went along with it. Linda knew about us? She did. It was a conscious, therapeutic approach... Conscious? Are you fucking kidding? But it turned real. Linda had me cut myself with razor blades and fuck my doctor to maximize my potential as an asset? But it didn't work. Pain released endorphins had actually dampened your abilities. The cutting came later. It was your idea. To suppress emotion. And your EVA. [TENSE MUSIC] After the fire, you stopped trying. You swore you would never do it again. I'm sorry to disappoint you sick fucks. - I'll let myself out. - Myfanwy!
