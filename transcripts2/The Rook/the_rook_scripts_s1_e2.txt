The body of the thermal sphere for 12 hours, What do you expect from everyone? There are only two. Qualified employees, And they sometimes need to sleep. I know it's my job. But we're working as fast as we can. As long as we can. THERE ARE NO SHORTCUTS IN THE FOLLOWING CASES: All corpses. The sign is different. The lungs are worn out. Spine fracture, The collapsed agency, Subdural hemorrhage. These would be better. Completely different Crime scene. Shattered ribs. Multiple holes Bilateral. What is normal It means to hit or crush.

It was an easy task. I do not have a good business. Pass the obvious. Yeah, yeah, yeah! Your daughter. Neruk. As you know, Service agencies do not. Their faultless. US BVA Be overly regulated. And trustfully hypocritical. Our Chekki fell into a labyrinth. In politics. But people like you... Cruel and unfounded enthusiasts Leaving millions of profits. From people like me.

Uh, yes. And? Nothing. It was perfect. Waste of time this. You know how to drink? Hurt someone's memory. Do not stalk me. Jean or vodka? I lost my way. Can I have one? I'm getting my foot back all day And nothing came back. Nothing. It's just a huge black hole. Where my life should be. Those bodies... What kind of monster am I? Do not You are not a monster. You are a competent young woman. Devoted to saving lives I will not destroy them. And the core part The survivors of you. What remains Of your memory. Where are my parents? They left the world. A long time ago. You were too young. I'm sorry. Your life was really hard. In many ways. I'll promise It is an advantage of forgetting. So I just have to enjoy it. In a black hole? Try it? Or I could use this. As an opportunity. To reinvent yourself. Now, I have a farmhouse. It's a few hours away. Very far Very safe. There's a duck pond. Private chef. Really, it is lovely. I prepared for your stay. Gustal will take you. I thought you said. If I did not go to work. The sky will fall. Well, ultimately That is my decision. And I'll handle the aftermath. No. I will not find myself. In a fucking resort. I need to know who I am. And the answer is not. Four ducks in the pond. So thanks for suggesting. I remain Reckless rash It is a restrained expression. Those people on the bridge It was not our friend. As far as I know is I do not have friends. I can see it. Follow myself. Oh, do you think so? - Well. - Well. Then take medicine. From tonight. 20 milligrams, Three times a day. What do you know About my medicine? They help you. Stay in control. Oh, trust me.

Industry. The keys. - What? - Your car. - I need a key. - To Paria... I'll take you home. You drank. Yes. So you're not talking about us? You better not. Because... Because if we talk I ask what is happening. Damn things are happening. And you will not like it here. The conversation starts there. Enormous So you're mad at me. This disaster And you're standing on the stage. Goddamn wine tasting It is hard to believe. Where did you come from? Talk about it before? With Alex? With you? Us? - Back to the legs? - No. This is not a private matter. This is about work. When you hold on to your position Even if you do not accomplish anything. About your responsibility. You put us all in danger. You are right. It is good to be silent. Okay, I'll drive. Just take some rest. I did not ask you. He'll take me anywhere. No, I was in Paris. In Manhattan.
