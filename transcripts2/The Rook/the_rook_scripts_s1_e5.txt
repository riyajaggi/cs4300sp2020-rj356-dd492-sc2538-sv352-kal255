 Previously on "The Rook"... This is your time. Figure out what you want from it. We talked about this. Leave Andrew Bristol to his creepy fucking birds. - Linda knew about us? - She did. Linda had me fuck my doctor to maximize my potential as an asset. I went to Myfanwy's apartment this morning. She has a key to a safe deposit box in the Lugat bank. You get Myfanwy, I get Nazim.

 I'll find him for you and bring him to you. Then you give me what I was promised. I've been ahead of you every step of the way. Because you're protecting your dead vulture boyfriend. He was not a vulture. When you kidnap EVAs and sell them to the highest bidder... That's being a vulture. I asked to meet with your employer. Lorik Pernaska is a busy man. Can I help you? I'm the one who wiped your memory. You got a rare talent, kid. You should get paid for it.

 You speak English? Don't worry, Nazim. I'm here to help. Yeah, I know your name. And I know you speak English, which means you understand every word I'm saying. I'm not gonna hurt you. You work for charity? Not exactly. I find people. Now, I've got a client who wants to give you a one-way ticket to England... no jumping on trucks, no crowded boats. What do you say? So who was the client? The person who brought you to England. A woman. Kind, like you. She tell me her name is Bronwyn. Bronwyn? Yes. She tell me she work for British government, that I will go to special school for people like me. But... first I must... help them. She showed me picture. My picture? They tell me it is good thing they are doing... that... that you will be happy. It's not your fault. I'm not going to hurt you. You're freezing. Find him. Bring him to me. I'll keep my end of the deal. You have 24 hours. Do you think it helps to put a fucking clock on it? I just want you to be a bit more focused this time. I am not giving you another chance. I will find him as fast as I can. I must say, you look a lot better in that than I do. Is this your phone? She gave it to me. Bronwyn. For case of emergency. But when I text her yesterday, she tell me to meet her west of Tower Bridge. But when I go, a different woman waiting. A different woman? Come. Do you recognize any of these people as Bronwyn or the woman you saw yesterday? This one. She was waiting. I think to take me away. Right, okay, um, you stay here. And, uh, don't worry. You're safe. No one can come in. Just don't open the door. Where are you going? I'm gonna get answers for the both of us. We're gonna help each other, okay? Shrewd maneuver. You're letting me win. What? No, I'd never do such a thing. Hello, Myfanwy. Lorik Pernaska. Yes? It's 10:00. Ready? Hello. Morning, Ingrid. Coffee? Thank you. Um, this phone... Mm-hmm. I'd love it if you could find out who it's registered to... name and address on the account. Of course. I'll send it down to D & E. Have you got the number? Uh, yes. I called myself. Confidentially, I assume. You assume correct. I always do. If you could sign this... And the other one. Fair warning... the questions are personal, but I assure you, our sole interest is in protecting you from any threat of blackmail or extortion, be it external pressure or from each other. So it really is... Can we just get on with it? Of course. Could I start by asking how long these sexual encounters have been taking place? - Over 18 years. - 11 months. We, um... We have a history. Uh, but we reconnected approximately a year ago after dinner at The Ledbury... 11 months. Have you ever taken recreational drugs as part of your sexual activities? No. Have you ever used departmental property, vehicles, or offices for your sexual encounters? - No. - Yes. The... the BMW isn't yours? Have you ever performed or received oral sex? Yes. Anal sex or oral-to-anal stimulation? - No. - Nope. Have you ever urinated on your partner... Oh, come, for fuck's sake. Why would anyone want to... No! Any history of BDSM? I think this meeting is over. One last question... In line with policy, you have a choice. Do you plan to disclose the relationship or to end it? - Disclose it. - End it. So that's... that's it? Throw it away? Not here. Not now. Yes, yes, here. Yes, now. No. Look, we both knew one day that this could happen. If you're not ready to make a choice about your marriage, then so be it. But that's no reason to throw it all away. - Yes, it is. - It isn't. It... Things have changed. The PM is a wounded animal right now. When someone puts him out of his misery... This could be my time. Well, forgive me for standing in your way. Oh, as if your own aspirations are irrelevant. Lately this relationship seems awfully convenient for you, don't you think? I resent that implication. I've shown you nothing but patience. I've been waiting for you. I never asked you to wait. Waiting for years, just hoping you'd find it in your heart to give me ten minutes between breakfast and your next bad idea. Wow. Jennifer, I d... I didn't... You're right, I've ha... I've had some bad ideas, and this was one of them. And until this is safely behind us, we shouldn't be seen together, even casually. And don't even think about coming to Jonjo's dinner tonight. This is a mistake. Sorry to interrupt. Do you have a moment? I don't suppose I have a choice. How did it go yesterday with Andrew Bristol? You know what? I'm not even gonna ask how you know. But I will say that it was enlightening. Of course I'd have preferred you not to reopen that mess, but it's not up to me. No. It's not. Do you want to talk about what happened? About how you pimped me out for my training? Is that what he told you? Yeah, he said it was a therapeutic experiment. Your therapeutic experiment. That is absurd. You started that all on your own. I mean, Andrew was clearly infatuated with you, but he was married... but I told him to end it. Bullshit. I did. It was wrong, and I knew it. But... then you seemed so happy, that I decided I didn't want to take that away from you. What was I to do to stop you? Not encourage it. Oh, since when did that sort of thing need the encouragement of a third party? Did he... did he tell you about the fire? That's when things went wrong. You were plagued with guilt and self-blame. You withdrew from the world, from all of us. I'll never forgive him for that... or myself. So, when that chapter of your life was erased, I saw an opportunity for a fresh start. That's all. A meeting is convening in your office. What meeting? The Founders' Statement was abundantly clear. "Utilize assets to protect and serve the interest of the country." Instead, all of your time is taken up in what amounts to an arms race. And even that goes to shit. What's going on here? There's another target roving around loose, attracting everyone's attention but ours. On the contrary, we're well aware. Gestalt, will you summarize, please? Oh, j-just the one of you. We don't need the whole song and dance. We received intelligence, somewhat belatedly, of an illegal auction two days ago. EVAs were represented as works of art embedded within a legitimate auction. - Some buyers were aware. - Not buyers. Sick, twisted collectors. I was there. I tailed the target for nine hours in captivity... To central London where he escaped from his transport van. Then the target wiped out a cop at the farmers market. Thank you, Monica, for your intervention. That was very helpful. But back to the target. Uh, subject is male, approximately 16... North African or Middle Eastern heritage. We were close, but, unfortunately, his location is currently unknown. I am beginning to understand why Ms. Reed might think it necessary to work on her own. Oh, by the way, fantastic dress for a field mission. When you consider the lack of protocol on our end... what could possibly be the explanation? Anybody? Gestalt fully responded to orders. It was a judgment call on my part to send them alone. Okay. Give us the room, please. Gestalt, Ops team drops everything. Nobody sleeps till this boy is found. Myfanwy, give them everything they need... blank check on this one. This kid is mine. He should be handed over to my agency the minute that he's capture. Monica, as always, we are very grateful for your assistance, but our soil, our asset. Really, Conrad? So you can chew him up in your freak factory and spit him out on your Island of Misfit Toys? Okay, you know what? He's better off on the run. Myfanwy, was there something else? No. If the gunmen are Russian, I'll link them to the poisoned diplomat in Hampstead last month. They'll be deported before anyone can ask any questions. Conrad? Yes, uh, sorry. I am listening. Soviet nerve agent, perfect cover. Thank you. - Danielle? - Yeah? What are you doing tonight? Well, working. Why? I have a dinner in Notting Hill. Old Oxford set... a political fund-raiser masquerading as a party. It'll be, uh, shepherd's pie and champagne with a side order of public-school asshole. What do you say? Well, those are all my favorite things. So how can I refuse? From what I hear, you weren't even in the bloody building, never mind supervising. You sabotaged the panic lines. It's as if you stopped weighing out the risks and don't give a fuck about the reward. I stand by my decision. You know, perhaps I'm not the only reason you're feeling frustrated today. Honestly? You did me a favor. I could hardly promote Conrad while I was fucking him. But now that you've forced us to... I don't care about your private life. Truly, I don't. The security of this agency is what matters. Exactly, and now that you have forced us to end our relationship... I'm free to make some long overdue changes around here. You're suspended until further notice. Hey. So that target... when you found him, he was roaming the market alone? Even an ordinary boy can be an elusive target. Why do you ask? Just keeping up, that's all. You're buzzing. Is that a burner phone? Yeah, doubling in, uh, drug dealing. Client phone. The number's registered to a Mr. John Comstock. What's this? A list Monica gave me a couple of days ago. Aliases used by Marcus Kevler. So the phone belongs to Marcus? That's right, but it gets stranger. I ran a second check for all incoming calls to that phone, and they're all from another phone also registered to John Comstock. Where's Monica? Whenever you're ready, ma'am. Hi. Jesus. You scared me. You don't look scared. You look pissed off. Perceptive. You people are insane, all of you. I, um, overheard what you said to Grantchester, and I agree. He should give you more respect. He thinks he can keep pushing me to the outside. Like I don't know what's really going on here. What's really going on? I don't understand. Don't play dumb. Linda and Conrad obviously know a lot more about this investigation than they're telling anyone. At least more than they're telling me. You think they're hiding something. I think you all are. So what's the big secret, Myfanwy? How do I know I can trust you? Why wouldn't you? You know why I'm here, and you know what I want. The question is, why would I trust you? Because what I'm about to tell you will give you the ammunition to have me fired... if not arrested. And I'm gonna tell you anyway. I have the boy. His name is Nazim. You're harboring the target? He's in my apartment right now scared out of his mind, and he said he knew Marcus. He did. I just don't know how. So help me connect the dots and get him out to safety. Off the radar. Why me? Why not your own agency? It's like you said. They're hardly being transparent. And you have nothing to lose. Do we have a deal? It's just me. Hi. Um, there's someone outside that wants to talk to you. Don't worry. You can trust her. She wants to help. Just, um, tell her everything... Except the bits about me. Got it? Okay. That's him... John, the one who found me in camp. His name's not John. It's Marcus. And you think he wanted to sell me? No fucking way. Um, this phone is register to a John Comstock. But a text that came in yesterday connects back to Linda Farrier. What? That doesn't make any sense. I've been following Marcus for months, and nothing connects to Farrier. Teddy Gestalt here to see you. I'll get rid of him. Where are we going? I want to talk. Go ahead. Talk away. Can I not come up? Can we walk? It's just... I've been sitting all day. Do you remember back in Glengrove when we hid in the kitchen after curfew? That was a long time ago. Come on. How often did you break curfew? We barricaded the door with milk crates, remember? One of you, two of me, and... some other kid I forget. You hadn't gotten the concept of me yet. Still thought we was all siblings, not all... me. Yeah, well, it takes a while to get the hang of you. Do you remember how I convinced you? You touched Eliza... and asked if I could feel it. It was your idea. Yeah, sorry, I-I-I don't. There's a lot from that time that I've had to block out. Peter Van Syoc didn't kill those people at the bridge... or the bank. I fought him toe-to-toe, and he... well, he didn't even show a trace of that kind of power. But you know who does? Then you're attacked by the Lugat. Massive breach of code. And while we're cleaning up that mess, you fuck off to Bristol, of all people. How long have you been following me? This week has been chaos... full-blown hell. And it all leads back to you. You know you make me dizzy. You've always known. But you never come near me like that till this week. You need to stop fucking lying and tell me what kind of shit you're in. Otherwise, what am I supposed to think, hmm? Except that you fucked me... to fuck with me... to get me out of the fucking way. Yeah. That's all I need to know. Teddy. Fuck. Nazim. If you want to see Nazim, come to Greenwich Park, 8:00 a.m. tomorrow... Jubilee Avenue entrance, blue bench, and don't be late. He'd spent 6,000 pounds in legal fees to fight a 50-pound fine, but still he wants to appeal to the high court. When I politely suggested that it might be a waste of money, he said, "Do you know what, Colin? You're right. I'll quit while I'm ahead." Darling? Are you all right? It's been a difficult week, but... it'll be better tomorrow. Ian, so you must come. Remind me, are we groveling for money or favors? Um, well, it's neither. It's just a mundane obligation. So we're the ones dispensing the favors? - - Funny, that's exactly how it feels. Yep, you're right. Screw the rounds. Let's go for a French exit. Mm. Oh, shit. - You all right, darling? - Yep, I'm fine. This is certainly, um, low-key. Mm, humble is the new ostentatious. And over there is our host... Special Advisor to the Chancellor... Ingratiating himself with the chairman of KCB. So what do all these people think you do? A few assume some clandestine level of service. Mm-hmm. - But know better than to ask. - Mm-hmm. And the others have no bloody idea. So they don't know if I'm here as your colleague or as your date? Let them guess. Well, if you're with Conrad, it must be both. That's fine by me. I have nothing to hide. Spoken like a trustworthy agent of the Secret Service. Home Secretary, good to see you. Trevor Birch, Danielle Wulff. - Pleased to meet you. - You too. I greatly admire your wife. Have since I was a child. Would you excuse us a minute? I would have thought one visit from the vetting office would be enough for the day. The invitation said plus-one. Danielle agreed to join me. I'm sure she has her own agenda. Fine. So do I. Now, contrary to what you might believe, I am not here for you. - Lorik Pernaska. - Mm-hmm. A back alley would have been a more suitable place to meet. No one knows that but you. All anyone else here thinks is that he's the third-largest donor to the party. Best to meet him here on his own territory. You take the sofa. I'm gonna sleep in the panic room. Kind of used to it. Just want to make sure, you... you really want to open this bottle? It's, uh... it's really special. Yeah, actually, I don't remember why I got it. Unwanted gift probably. Unwanted gift, huh? You and I have very different takes on gifts. Thanks. It's actually pretty nice. Mm. So how do you know so much about whiskey? My dad. Are you close? Was, yeah. He was a scotch snob. Mom was a high-functioning alcoholic. They made a great match. Marcus used to say I took after both of them. And how did you guys meet? I was chasing a target for months all the way up the East Coast. They were hiding out in the woods in Toronto. And, um, well, Kevler had high-acuity perception. So we brought him in to track her. We staked her out every night together for two weeks. And, uh... Well... When we finally apprehended the target, I started feeling really fucking sad that I would never see Marcus again. But you did. Yeah. He transferred to my division. 23 mostly happy months. Then he took this mission in Azerbaijan. It was just a simple detect and disrupt. He went dark halfway through. Um... But the BVA looked for him. Well, yeah, at first. You know, at first, he was AWOL. Then he was missing. Then he was missing, presumed captured, then he was missing, presumed dead. What, and then the agency just stopped? Pretty much, yeah. You know, I was tracking the activity of his aliases, and I got a hit in Paris. And all of a sudden, he shows up here... dead. He could have just reached out, you know? I'm sure he had a good reason. Yeah? What was it, then? Sorry, that's just... something people say. English people... we don't really make conversation. We just recycle a handful of polite phrases. Well, what about you? You live here alone or...? No guy or girl or Gestalt? I've noticed the way you guys look at each other. You're always giving each other the, uh... the eight eyes. So how'd that start? And which one did it start with? Was it Eliza? You know, I-I don't remember. Gestalt's always just been there. We should probably get to bed. Big day tomorrow. Do you need anything else? I'm good. Thanks. Good night. Good night. To your ability to maintain a civil facade. It's an impressive contrast to the way you do business. I'm afraid I don't follow. You want the Lugat to be welcome in political circles, and yet you refuse to adhere to our diplomatic code. Apologies. No one sent me a copy. Well, let me tell you what it is. It's really very simple. Keep your hands off my rook. You're the one who called me today. Yes. We didn't step into Rook Thomas's world, I assure you. She stepped into ours. How so? You know, I'm more than willing to help assist safe travel out of the country for a valuable asset in trouble. Myfanwy smuggled someone out? Not someone. Herself. Said she needed an emergency exit in place. A one-way ticket, prepaid. If she paid you to smuggle her out, why is she still here? You know women. They take so long to get ready. Or maybe she just changed her mind. Either way, I still have her deposit. Kindly remember I told you all this asking nothing in return. Consider it a gesture of good faith. Next time, prepare to make a trade. I'm always willing to bargain with the King. I think you're confusing me with Linda. And yet here we are. It's 8:05. She's late. Mm. Whoever it is, she'll be here. I always have trouble fitting these things properly. He did it to you, didn't he? Nazim. He wiped your memory? Okay, don't lie to me now, all right? I just started liking you. So how much did he take? Weeks? Months? Years? All of it. What gave me away? You're always, you know, quiet. Reading the room. Unspoken signals. And you're just making shit up on the fly all the time. I mean, don't get me wrong here. You're good, but... once the kid showed up, I put it together. But right now, stay in the car, okay? No, I'm coming with you. Engage the safety, pop the mag, and check the chamber. Show me you can do that, and you can come. Okay. Stay in the car. Gestalt, what is it? I followed Myfanwy. She's found the target. The boy? Where is he? With her. She's been hiding him in her apartment. Now she's with the American waiting for someone. All right, wait there. And when their contact arrives, bring them all in. Myfanwy and the boy, too. Nazim! Nazim. I-I thought you'd left me. Left the city. Not without you! Come on, you've got a passport. It's all arranged. - Where are we going? - Aberdeen first. And then from there, wherever it's safe. Just hold it right there. She just wants to talk to you. What do you want? Do you know this man? Yeah. I do. I did. How do you know him? He's a friend. What kind of friend? Why is it any of your business? - You really should lock your doors. - What are you doing here? I'd ask you the same question, but I'll wait for the interrogation. - Drive. - Look, Gestalt, please I can explain. - Just wait for Monica and... - I'll take care of Monica. - Start the car. - No! Don't be difficult. Come on, let's go. This woman does not care about you. The hell I don't. I don't think you realize what you're up against. I know exactly what I'm up against, Monica. You and your agencies kidnapping kids, forcing them into servitude. How do you know my name? I know all about you. Marcus told me everything. You're fucking lying. He died trying to take my sister back from you people. Your sister? Myfanwy is my sister. And I'm gonna get her back. Run. Run. Run! Myfanwy! Wait. Please, wait! Myfanwy, no!
