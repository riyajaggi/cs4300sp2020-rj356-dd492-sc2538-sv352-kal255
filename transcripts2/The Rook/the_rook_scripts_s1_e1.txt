God, I hope this isn't ours. [ INDISTINCT CHATTER ] Detective. - Linda. - How can we help? Hell if I know. First call pointed to gang violence. Victims could have been killed somewhere else and dumped here as some kind of message. What about terrorism? Definite possibility. Chemical weapons? Forensics team is here, CTC alerted and on the way. - LINDA: Good. - TEDDY: No, that's not what happened here. Disparate injuries with no use of weapons or external force...

What is happening here? Who did you meet at the bridge? I don't know. Was it a prearranged meeting, an ambush? I don't know. - And at the bank? - I don't know. I woke up. There were bodies. I ran. And I can tell you who the prime minister is and the names of the members of the royal family and the president of Belarus for some reason, but I can't tell you who I am, who you are, or what the fuck is going on. Please, tell me. The only thing that I know is that we need to get you to work... now. - The Checquy? - Yes. Whatever happened at the bridge has become an international incident. You need to be in the office, or people may wonder. Right, so just to be clear, I'm at the center of an international incident that I have no memory of, and you want me to act completely normal in a job I don't know how to do? You're a bureaucrat, not a brain surgeon. Don't talk to anyone, and you'll be fine. You don't have a choice. This isn't a hotel. You can't just check out. You're a government asset, and you need protection. From who? Get dressed, and I'll explain on the way... I'm not going anywhere. I only came here because I thought it might spark a memory... Myfanwy, this isn't the moment. But I don't recognize this life, and I don't want it. You need to stay calm. Where are your pills? Hmm? [ SOMBER MUSIC ] ♪ ♪ These were your idea.
