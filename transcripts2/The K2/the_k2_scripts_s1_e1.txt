Stay still! Stop it. Leave now. Go! Damn it. There's been a mugging on Platform Two. Please, help me. Please! Mister! My dad is in Madrid. Please take me there! I'm telling you the truth! If you take me there, my dad will pay you a lot. -Please! -Hey. I have a lot on my plate right now. Leave me alone. I'm telling you the truth! Bad guys keep on trying to take me away! -Please! -Hey. -Please. -You're saying cops are the bad guys. I'm actually worse than them, understood? Let go of me.

No, it's too hard for you. Yes, sir? TAE SHIN ADS Geez, I'm so damn pissed! The banner is getting loose because of the wind. They want it to be fixed right now. But I won't be able to do that by tomorrow! Can I get your help? It should be easy to fix by yourself. What brings you here, sir? -I'm here to fix the banner. -We are closed now. Someone asked me to come. Do you have an ID? No, I don't. I can't let you in. Please come back tomorrow. Damn it. Wait, young man. Wait a second, please. How could you send him away? The manager wanted it to be fixed immediately! And this man was here last time to hang the banner too. I still can't let him in without an ID. You're in big trouble now. The manager seemed to have been scolded quite thoroughly by madam, too. -Madam... did it herself? -Yeah! Me? How long is it going to take for you to fix it? Well, at least 20 to 30 minutes, I guess. Aw, man. Thank you, ma'am. It was nothing. People like us who get paid daily can't afford to waste a day. My son is struggling nowadays too because of a bad economy. By the way, it's quite windy today. Will you be all right? I'll be fine. Oh, my... What are you doing? Nothing. I was just pouring wine. Wine? -Come on, take it slow! -Slow? That word isn't in my vocabulary. I hate doing things slowly. Oh, just a second. Hello. -Welcome. -Thank you. Madam, you must be as busy as Congressman Jang Se-joon nowadays. Thank you for taking the time to come here. Not at all... Aren't you tired of seeing her face already? You see her every day! Do you know why we invited you today? Let me see what she says. We asked people whom they would prefer as their First Lady. You received the most votes evenly from the 20s to the 70s. What? So you're the most popular pick among all the potential First Ladies! Congratulations! -Oh, really? I am? -Yes! Oh, come now. Everyone is praising you, calling you the perfect supportive wife. Oh, I'm not even close! I just make sure that he eats breakfast. That's all. Wait, so you make breakfast for him? It's a bit embarrassing, but I think I enabled some of his bad habits. He's such a picky eater that he won't eat unless I cook for him myself. Oh, I see! You're famous for being a great cook, after all. Oh, stop it. People might actually believe you! The guests who visited our home just say that to be polite. Then you prepare food for your guests with your own hands? Yes. I'm not that good. You're embarrassing me. Wow, you really are amazing. No more, okay? Look at you, being so naughty. Fine. Eh? I'll go really naughty today. Oh, look at you. Oh? I'll scold you if you keep acting like this! SOCIAL WELFARE PROMO TEAM Get the camera ready and make sure to record it. Yes, sir. Close the curtains. You little... How dare you-- Sleep tight. It'll be over soon. -You're not allowed here. -Yeah, whatever. Ma'am! Ma'am! Ma'am! No! No! Is anyone there? What is it? This is Station One. Answer me! Anybody? -Sir! There's-- -I'm on my way now. -Keep things safe. -Yes, sir. Damn it! Come on! Please get me out! Please, get me out! Hurry! Move away from the door! Ma'am! Ma'am! Hurry. Their men are here. Move out! Ma'am! Ma'am! Are you all right? What about the congressman? Fortunately, the door to his room didn't go down. Call 911. Call 911! We need an ambulance here. Please unlock the door to the congressman's room. It's unlocked! Um, since we're on the topic of you being a supportive wife, some people say that your husband's success is greatly benefited by his in-laws? His in-laws? Well, does he have another in-laws besides my own parents? That's funny. But still, you're the eldest daughter of the owner of JB Group. And it's true that JB Group is the most powerful conglomerate in this country. To tell you the truth, I feel sorry for my husband... for having met a woman like me. If he'd met someone else… he would've been a welcomed son-in-law. Oh... it seems that there were some difficulties in the past. My late father... didn't want a son-in-law in politics. Then, the reason why Chairman Choi, your late father cut off ties with you... was because of your husband? I'm sorry. It seems that I touched a sensitive topic. No problem, it's okay. Both men and women… need to be loyal to the one they love, don't they? You really loved your husband quite a lot, didn't you? You even gave up your right as an heir to the company for him. Yes. And in fact, I still... respect my husband. They're coming out! -What's going on? -What's the current condition? How did the room look like? -Please, say something! -How is the patient? He works at an ads company? Yes, sir. And yet he broke that thick glass? Then you don't have any shares in JB Group anymore, madam? I know that you had quite a bit that you inherited before your marriage. Oh. You mean the shares I had when I was single? I already donated those long ago. Oh, are you referring the Pyeongchang Scholarship Foundation? Yes. However, I heard that there are special relationships between you and two of the board directors. If that is correct, don't you still possess a lot of JB Group shares in reality? Mr. PD, they want us to cut the feed for a second. Anchor Jo, we'll continue after commercials. Well, then. Let's listen to your answer after the commercials. We'll continue after the commercial! Ji-yeon. Yeah, Yoo-jin? I thought I told you that I didn't want to talk about it. Yoo-jin, wouldn't it be less painful for me to do it than anyone else? You know what? Everyone has a weakness. It would be your son in your case. All right, the commercial break will soon be over. We'll be shooting now! Please turn on your mics! All right. Shall we get started? Sorry, Yoo-jin. I went too far. Yeah, Ji-yeon. Let's just follow the script. All right, honey? I am so touched by your interview today, madam. Really? Thank you. I was so nervous. No! You looked so natural and so beautiful! Could you give us a moment? -Excuse me? -It's fine. I'll do the rest by myself. -Thank you. -Yes, madam. Oh, wait. Thank you so much for today. I baked some cookies. Not sure if they're any good, though. Oh, I'm so touched, madam! -Can I take a photo of these? -What? Oh, no! Stop it. I won't eat these and treasure them forever! Thank you. Again? Who's behind it this time? The investigation hasn't been concluded yet, but... it seems like Congressman Park... No doubt about it. Cookies that madam baked for me! Behind them is the bag that madam has used for 20 years. I respect you and love you, madam! Heart, heart! -Hey, what are you doing? -Man, I respect her so much. Madam made these herself! Really? -Give me one! -No! These are my new family heirlooms! Geez, you're so stingy. Let me see the photo, though. Wow! What shall we do, ma'am? Alter the crime scene… so it looks like some unidentified assailants attacked the office. Yes, ma'am. Then... what about the girl? Just leave her be for now. We'll definitely have a use for her later. Yes, ma'am. That's enough. I got more wrinkles. How old is she? -Excuse me? -That... girl. She's in her late 20s. At least she's not a minor. It's me. Am I going to have breakfast that you made starting tomorrow? You looked good on TV. Yes, I believe that you cleaned it up. And... about the banner guy... please take good care of that for me. That rascal happened to see my face. The banner... guy? Okay. Hello, President Guk? Yes. Is there something that you're hiding from me? Excuse me, madam? Of course not! -How could I ever-- -I really shouldn't be like this to you, but I feel rather irritating. No, madam! That's not it! I just didn't want you to bother you with unnecessary burdens. I was going to take care of it myself, and then-- Yes, I apologize. I'll keep that in mind, ma'am. I'll take care of it and get back to you for sure. Yes, yes. Please get some rest. Damn it, how did she find out already? They are on their way, right? Yes, sir. They'll catch him soon. I can't believe a banner guy caused such a big hassle. -Is this the only footage we got? -Yes, sir. Wait. Rewind. Yeah, right there. No way. Chief Joo. Please recall the men. -What did you say? -If you don't... all those men may die at his hands. What do you mean by that? Chief Joo! You sure have gotten funnier nowadays, but that's really a hoot. -Our men are in danger! -Wait. Colonel Joo... I mean, Chief Joo, so you're telling me that he's someone you trained while you were in the Special Forces? That's correct. All right, then. I guess you're trying to say that you trained the strongest agents-- -That's not it, sir! -Chief Joo! I don't think you understand what I'm saying. I even sent the private army to catch one petty banner guy. Do you get that? They are the best private army in Korea, from JSS! You'll understand what I'm saying very soon. How dare you... That impudent bastard! Unbelievable. Let's move, now! Report the situation. Report the situation! Report the situation! Report the situation! Hey! What happened? What the hell had happened? What a relief. Sir? What do you mean by that? Nobody's dead. Why are you still here in the living room? I need to stay up late tonight. There are matters to attend to. Why? Is there someone else causing trouble besides me? Your daughter. What about Anna? She ran away again. She should have matured a bit by now, but it seems not. I guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree, huh? If something bad happens to her... our contract is null and void. You know that, right? What happened? SLEEPING PILLS I didn’t kill her. I didn’t kill her. So you're saying that you lost the banner guy. He's not someone who would be caught by JSS. Who sent you? If I come to see you for the second time, you'll die. You were in the wrong place at the wrong time and saw something you shouldn't have. I'm sorry. You're pretty, just like your mother. I remember everything. Mom didn't commit suicide. She's the reason why I've been forced to indulge Yoo-jin's every whim. Subtitle translation by Hye Young Beom
