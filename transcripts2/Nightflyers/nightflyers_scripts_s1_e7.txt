 Previously, on "Nightflyers"... D'Branin. Initiate playback. - Daddy, look. - You remember on the ship? You ordered a hot dog from Silver Spurs? Downtown Dog, circa 2077. My mom took us there. It was the first time I felt normal. We need to send the probe. It might be the closest we ever get to the Volcryn. Safe travels, little rabbit. Why is the fucking probe in my room?

 You tell me. It's not really hardware anymore. It's actually a being. Volcryn. It's dying. I have a Petri dish full of cells that don't want to die. Wanna take a look? At your space blood? I thought you'd never ask. You let him watch us. Okay, I'm sorry. I really am. Don't come to my room anymore. - Cynthia Eris. - She was fractured into two sub-processors A younger oneuncorrupt... The other broken. We need to find a way to seal her up

 in that world, permanently. Go! Go, run! I was on the "Lunar 71" shuttle. The L on that flight was one of the first. She took our normal fear and amplified it. It turned into a wave. Everyone was ripping each other apart. I know how you feel about telepaths. We've all seen what Ls can do on those vids. Very powerful L1s can do that, but not under suppression. What exactly is the logic of bringing your ex here to deep space? You're an L. Oi, none of that. In your mouth, love. Oi. Looking at me this time, yeah? She pissed herself! My God. That was so good. - Yeah, you're welcome. - My God. That's disgusting. Wow. Well, they're my friends and they like it. Can't you find something a little more cheerful? Cheerful? We've done all that. We went skiing on the Matterhorn, kite-surfing in Fiji. We did Dungeons & Dragons. - I don't know what that is. - It's a game, Agatha. It's a sweet, fun, boring fucking game. They want more. They want something real, so... Well, this isn't real. I see. He's been ignoring you. That's why you're snooping around, innit? I'm not snooping. I just came down here to see you. To see what you're getting up to. All he does is work, work, work? Fucking Boy Scout. Have your fun, Thale. Just remember, they're not like us. Thanks, Mommy. Right, who's next? D'Branin test log Attempt 19 to communicate with the Volcryn. - Recording. - Initiate memory playback. Test failure. D'Branin test log Attempt 34. Connecting organics from the Volcryn-affected probe drives to the sphere core to open communications with the Volcryn. Stop memory playback. Test failure. Biometrics for activity patterns or signs of communication. D'Branin, initiate memory playback. - Test failure. - Stop memory playback. I've increased probe matter integration into memory sphere optical network based on data analysis. Test 79. Memory Suite hybrid with Volcryn-affected probe drives. Begin test now. Shit. God damn it. Chopping down the Terraform? Repurposing. Feels great to be working with my hands again. We're getting close to the Volcryn. We should be picking up real-time data soon. - Karl must be pleased. - I haven't seen him. Everyone's so distracted. Rowan, stop. I'm worried about our team. The mission. Why we came here. You know what they say. All work and no play... Hey, babes. And how's my little mama doing? Starving. Did you get any of those little snacky crackers? I did not. I will get them now, though. Nah, don't worry about it. Stay here with me. Us. I'd love to. Our little bee is buzzing. What's that, little bee? What the hell was that? - You saw it too. - That was a vision. You're not supposed to be able to. You can't... I don't know, Karl. I don't know, it's new. Please. I'm really scared. Agatha, L3s take impressions, feelings. Not... you can't do that. I've been... I've been taking suppressants... for most of my life. Now my regular dose isn't working. Twice that dose isn't working. I don't know what to do. What about the chair? It's my greatest fear. That I'll be locked away for my telepathy. No, no, no. No, no, no. I'll never let that happen to you. Says the man who looked like he was just about to run away. But I didn't. - No. - No. You didn't. No. They're losing sight of the big picture. We are days away from moving into range of the Volcryn, and Rowan is off with Tessia... - Preparing to be a father. - He's a xenobiologist about to make contact with alien life. This is when we should be at our most focused, and everyone is distracted. What about me? Have I changed? I don't know, Roy. You seem more... thoughtful. Reflective. I've been speaking with Agatha. She thinks I might break down any second. She hasn't exactly been acting normal either. - Am I changing? - Hey. You're still perfect. I'm serious. I've been naive before. I keep feeling like I'm missing something. What about Auggie? Still uptight. That much hasn't changed. Maybe worse. And Lommie? I don't know. We don't talk. She moved out of the mission lab months ago. Is she still keeping track of our firewalls in the Crystal? You're not hearing Cynthia, - are you? - No, nothing. That doesn't mean she's not trying to find a way out. And I know my mother... She'll never give up. Lommie won't let that happen. Are you sure we can trust her? She'll keep us safe. - Downtown Dog, Lommie? - Yes, please. And I'll have a lemonade. - Downtown Dog, Lommie? - Yes, and I'll have a milkshake today. Hey! Ooh, yummy. Looks good. We would have ordered for you but I wasn't sure what you wanted. I'm sorry I'm late. I had to run some calculations for Karl. I don't like that Karl. Feels like he's lost track of his priorities. Yeah, well, we've been out here for a long time. Is that why you made us? - You're bored? - You watch that. We're all grateful we can be together every day. Lommie did all that herself. She built all this. Eww. Gross. No, thatthat can't happen. I didn't code it this way. Hold on. Hello? Hello? Hello? Who's there? Hey, rally the troops. I've got a great idea. - What's that, man? - Well, see, you're base-jumping through a big cliff... And you're falling and you're falling and the ground's coming up to meet you, and then your chute doesn't open. Splat, done. Who's gonna like that? Thale, hey. What are we doing next? I'm the guinea pig, right? Whoa, whoa, whoa. You gotta ease up, all right? I'm game for whatever you want. You've gotta wait like everyone else. Well, I need the rush, Thale. - Please? - Willa. Give the man some space. Okay. We'll come get you when he's ready. Okay. Sorry. So tell me, how are things in your personal life? - How's Mel? - I adore Mel. She's everything I could ever want in a partner. So caring, smart... Authentic. But... But nothing. I just... I don't know... I worry she can't possibly really feel the way I do. Why not? She doesn't really know me. We're just different... that's all. I mean, she's perfect. I could never measure up. Because of your mother. Agatha. Sorry. Agatha? Hey. No, don't. No, I'm okay. I, uhl just... We can pick this back up tomorrow. I need to go lay down. I'll have Tobis come check up on you. Lock. - Record. - Recording. After the failure of Test 79, I am reexamining original parts of the probe in case I missed anything. See if I could... It's them. You okay? Good. - Hello. - Hi. Okay. Wow. It's so beautiful. It's quite the bundle. - Sixsix pounds? - That's correct. Two point seven kilograms. And the bub can hear us. Should we test its auditory systems? Play some music? I'm interested in the health of the child. Not if it can tell the difference between Beethoven and Mozart. Well, it'd just be nice to get some empirical data - on our baby genius. - Rowan. Honey, let's let Tobis do her job, okay? It's his first time being a daddy. He is a little baby-crazy. - I see that. - It's my first time too. Our first time. - Rowan. - Karl. Have a look at the most remarkable image. I really need to talk to you about something really important. Yeah, but look. - It's got my lips. - It's okay. Go talk. - Go with Karl. - Rowan. I think the Volcryn is trying to communicate with me. It was like an earthquake. It all just started... - Karl. - You have to come down to the Memory Suite... I did that. I did it for months. It's different now. How? How is it different? The probe is alive again. Okay, I'll come down after the scan. - Yes, thank you. - After the scan. Okay. Incorporating newly-revived probe material into memory sphere. Daddy? Skye? Can you see me? Yeah. Can you? - Answer. - Rowan? Remember your theory about how cells communicate in organic systems? Yeah, of course. Well I think that's what's happening with the probe now that we're getting closer - to the Volcryn. - What, it's... - It's talking to you now? - Yes! I think they're using my daughter to try and communicate with me. I need you to get down here and help, okay? Relax. I told you, I'm on my way. No, no, no, Rowan! Now! We need to start... Yeah, I said I'm on my way. Switch off. Hello? Is anybody here? My code has been corrupted. Someone's in here with us. No! No! Did you miss me? You can't. Howhow did you... Get out of that house? It was your fault... Wasn't it? You were the good part of her. II helped you! I let you be free! And I came back to thank you. No! Lommie, Lommie, Lommie. Lommie... Lommie. Fuck. What? What, what? What do you want? I've been trying to wake you. We're approaching the Volcryn, and you've been in there for hours. I thought you might... I thought you might be... What, dead? Yeah. For a second in there, I thought I was. Can that happen? Can that happen? Hey, why would that happen? When you die inside the Crystal, you're gone. There's nothing left to go in the body. Why would you die inside the Crystal, Lommie? Lommie! Are the firewalls still holding? We're still safe, right? Yeah. Yeah, I'm working on it. - Please, Mel, I need to think. - Wait! Waitwait a second. What is going on? I built a world in there. A place where I can be safe. Inside the Crystal Matrix? Why would you do that? Because... I hate my world out here. I fucked... I fucked up, Lommie. But you have to believe me, I never meant to hurt you. I should have been more careful with your feelings... Mel, it's not about you. I may have made a really big mistake. I don't know. I have to figure out a way... Let me help you. No. Need to do it myself. - Having cravings? - No. Thale, it's good to see you. Look at that belly. You look like a balloon. Come sit with us for a little while. I thought this was a date. It's fine, don't be a grump. Come. - Sit. - Where's your gang of adventurers? Probably looking for me, mate. They never leave me alone. Can you hear the baby's voice? Yeah. What? What is it? Did you hear the baby? Nothing. Um, I've been getting these... These flashes recently. - I've... - Thale, stop. What did you hear? It was like the bees. Millions of tiny voices. All right, thank you, Thale. That's quite enough. - I'm sorry. - Sorry? Sorry for what? Thale! Test 81. I've increased the amount of probe material. Attempting to reestablish contact with Skye. You came back. How are you here? Where are we? I was in my room, but... - Are you a ghost? - No. No, baby. I'm right here. But you left us... on your trip, and then you never came home. What trip, honey? The "Nightflyer." No, Skye. When I lived on the "Nightflyer"... you were gone. No, I was never gone. I was here with Mommy. You were the one who left. No, Skye. You got sick, remember? No, Daddy, I never got sick. No, Skye, the... The celio-virus. When it came through... Mommy took me to Aunt Janey's, remember? You had to keep working. Did you die, Daddy? Is that why you're here? Skye, shh. Please stop. Please. When are you coming home? Soon, baby, soon. I promise. You were right. All these cells communicating to each other. You integrated the probe into the Memory Suite. The Volcryn made the probe different. Memory Suite's special now. - How so? - All our memories, they exist within us, but they're a closed loop. With this, we can reach out beyond them. We can talk to the Volcryn now. To anybody. To the dead. Karl, I know you're very upset. - What are you talking about? - With me. The baby. It must be very difficult for you. For me? Why? What you went through with Skye. I don't want any bad blood between us, Karl. I came here to help you. I'm not the one who decided to completely abandon the mission. I didn't decide to ignore protocol, - and just because I... - Wait. - Have broken through here... - What protocol? Rowan, what's really important right now is that we can use this to talk to the Volcryn, to talk to anyone. What protocol? We can refine this. If we can make this we can reach the Volcryn. What... fucking... protocol? Rowan, we can create a whole new field of science. What fucking protocol? That all pregnancies in space must be terminated. Do it yourself. - I missed you. - I missed you too. I love you. I love you so much, Murph. Why'd you stop? Your face. What? No. No! No burns! We said no burns! No! No, no, the burns! - Keep going! - No, the burns! Please, Murph, I want to go back! It's not supposed to be you! Look at me. I protect you. I keep them away from you when you want to be alone. You owe me! I want to go back. I want to go back like it was before! You lying little shit! Enough! - Stop! - I can't. - I can't. - No, stop! - Stop, Thale, stop! - I can't. My hands! Where are my hands? Thale! Thale, you can turn it off. You can filter it. I can't, it's too strong. I can't. I'm a fucking freak show and nothing more! Attention, crew We are now within range of the Volcryn and experiencing concentrated waves of Teke energy. All nonessential crew, please remain in your quarters until further notice. Sorry we woke you. We just want to check everything's okay. Off-cycle is supposed to mean "off work," but new parents bring new priorities, I suppose. Well, nature doesn't always conform to office hours. I'm just a little nervous. Thank you for doing this, Tobis. Yeah. You might need to reboot the machine. Thank God. Thank God. It's detecting a cardiac abnormality. Your child is in distress. What? Well, there's something wrong with the scanner. I'll do what I can to save it. - "What you can"? - On-call med team to Bay 2, please. This is an emergency. - What do you mean? - We need to induce the birth right away. It's okay, baby. It's okay. I'm right here. They hate me. All of them. Don't come any closer. You get closer, it gets stronger. You feel it too. My suppressors are hardly working anymore. This energy we're feeling, you can't suppress it. I don't know what to do. We should never have come out here. I want to help you. There's no helping us now. Get the oxygen, please. The Pitocin is taking effect. - The baby is coming. - It's too early! It's too early. It's happening, Rowan. If you want to help, hold her down. We don't have equipment for this. It's coming too fast! It's the synthetics working. Just stay with me. There you go! I can see the head! Good, good, good! Just one more push! You can do it! One more push! Push, push, push! You did it, baby. You're amazing, darling. - What is it? - What's happening? What's happening? What? What? Aww, our baby. It's a girl. I'll call Captain Eris. Why? - What for? - It's protocol... When there's a death. Let me hold it. Will you get the blanket we made? I'm just finishing up. TessTess wants... Tess wants to bury... Skye in it. I don't understand. Skye. That's her name. Or was her name. Really? You're the reason that Tess and I met. We wanted to... We wanted to add something joyful to the memory of your daughter. Thank you, Rowan. I'm sorry. I really am. Photos. Take the time you need. We're here for you. Quarantine. Quarantine, now! Tessia! Tessia! Tessia!
