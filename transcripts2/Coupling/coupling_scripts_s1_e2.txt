 Coupling (2000â€“2004): Season 1, Episode 2 - Size Matters - full transcript 
 When Susan calls Steve, he instantly looses all his command of conversation, yet they agree to meet and she offers to cook, according to Sally an offer of free sex plus catering. Steve's report to the mates is treated to Jeff's dubious 'foreplay tips', such as avoiding at all cost to be even a moment, while undressing, naked except for socks, and one the mentioned girls overhear entering the bar: using the girlfriend's first name to call the celebrity one usually thinks of during sex. Jane is absurdly confident her own bisexuality makes her eligible for pure gay hunk Howard and switches all labels and concepts potentially implying any homophobia.

 OH, HI, STEVE. SO WHAT WAS THE PAUSE FOR? I DON'T KNOW.  I PANICKED. WHAT DID YOU DO AFTER THE PAUSE? WELL, THE PAUSE  GOT OUT OF CONTROL. YOU KEPT PAUSING?! IT GOT AWAY FROM ME. AT FIRST, IT WAS JUST  A NORMAL PAUSE, A COLLECT-YOUR-THOUGHTS PAUSE. THAT'S PERFECTLY ACCEPTABLE. BUT THEN... THEN I THOUGHT ABOUT THE PAUSE. AND NOW THE PAUSE  IS TOO LONG TO IGNORE! YEAH, THE PAUSE IS LIKE A WHOLE THIRD PERSON IN THE CONVERSATION. EXACTLY! ONLY NOT SAYING MUCH.

 RIGHT. LIKE PATRICK. NOW I'M A RABBIT IN HEADLIGHTS! THIS PAUSE  IS JUST EXPANDING AND EXPANDING LIKE THIS OUT-OF-CONTROL THING! YEAH, LIKE IN THE BLOB! YES, LIKE IN--  WHAT? THE BLOB, 50s HORROR MOVIE. THIS BLOB COMES FROM OUTER SPACE AND JUST KEEPS GROWING AND GROWING. RIGHT, THANKS. IT EATS PEOPLE! AND IN THE END THEY KILL IT BY ELECTROCUTION. BUT THAT BIT DOESN'T REALLY APPLY HERE. ANYWAY,  I'VE GOT THE PHONE  IN MY HAND AND I'M SAYING NOTHING. RIGHT. NO, NOTHING! NOTHING IS COMING  INTO MY HEAD! I HAVE FORGOTTEN  IN ONE MOMENT  OF EMBARRASSMENT THE ENTIRE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. I HATE IT WHEN THAT HAPPENS! I CAN FEEL MY HAIR  SWEATING! OH, GOD, YEAH. AND THERE'S ALWAYS THIS PUPPY TRAPPED IN A CAR THAT YOU'VE GOT TO RESCUE! WHAT? OH, SORRY. I'M BACK ON THE BLOB THERE. THERE'S ALWAYS THIS PUPPY TRAPPED IN A CAR IN THOSE MOVIES. OKAY. SORRY. SO, UM... THE BLOB FROM SPACE  IS THE PAUSE... YEAH. WHAT EXACTLY IS THE PUPPY? LOVE. WHAT? OBVIOUSLY, THE PUPPY REPRESENTS LOVE. YOU'VE GOT TO RESCUE  THE PUPPY OF LOVE FROM THE CAR... OF CONVERSATION. THAT'S RIGHT, ISN'T IT, JEFF? STEVE? HI, IT'S STEVE. YOU SAID. RIGHT--RIGHT, OF COURSE. UM... UM... THERE SEEMS TO BE A FAULT ON THIS LINE. BRILLIANT! PRETTY GOOD. A FAULT? YOU--YOU COULDN'T HEAR ME TALKING THEN, COULD YOU? I COULD HEAR YOU BREATHING. UH, THAT WASN'T ME. IT WASN'T YOU? NO, NO. UM... MAYBE--MAYBE THERE'S SOMEONE BEHIND YOU. I'M ALONE. LOOK-- I WAS JUST WONDERING, WOULD YOU LIKE TO MEET UP SOMETIME? OR ALTERNATIVELY, I COULD NEVER PHONE YOU AGAIN AND EMIGRATE. HOW 'BOUT TOMORROW NIGHT? GREAT. I SUGGEST NEW ZEALAND. KIDDING. RIGHT. WHY DON'T YOU COME 'ROUND TO MY PLACE. I'LL COOK. YOU SAID WHAT? I'LL COOK. IT JUST CAME OUT OF MY MOUTH. YOU KNOW WHAT "I'LL COOKSAYS?" IT SAYS,"LET'S HAVE SEX." NO. THAT WOULD BE "COME  AND SPEND THE NIGHT WITH ME." "COME AND SPEND THE NIGHT WITH ME" SAYS"LET'S HAVE SEX." "I'LL COOK"SAYS"LET'S HAVE SEX ANDI'LL CATER." SALLY... SUSAN, YOU ARE  OFFERING THIS MAN FOOD AND SEX  IN THE SAME PLACE. IF THERE'S SOMETHING TO READ IN THE LOO, HE MAY NEVER LEAVE. MEN DON'T EXPECT SEX JUST 'CAUSE YOU OFFER TO COOK. OKAY... HAVE YOU THOUGHT  THROUGH YOUR FOREPLAY YET? THEY KNOW ABOUT THAT? WHAT DO YOU MEAN, FOREPLAY?! WHAT DO YOU THINK I MEAN? I MEAN WHERE EXACTLY DO YOU TAKE YOUR SOCKS OFF? MY ADVICE IS TO GET THEM OFF RIGHT AFTERYOUR SHOES AND BEFOREYOUR TROUSERS. THAT'S THE SOCK GAP. MISS IT, AND SUDDENLY YOU'RE A NAKED MAN IN SOCKS. NO SELF-RESPECTING WOMAN WILL EVER LET A NAKED MAN IN SOCKS DO THE SQUELCHY WITH HER. THAT'S YOUR FOREPLAY TIP? SOCKS? MANY MEN HAVE FALLEN THROUGH THE SOCK GAP, PATRICK. UNDER THE SEXUAL ARENA OF EARTHLY DELIGHT, THERE LURKS A DEADLY PIT OF SOCKS. OKAY... FOREPLAY TIP NUMBER TWO... WHOEVER YOU NORMALLY  FANTASIZE ABOUT DURING SEX, START CALLING THEM "SUSAN." WITH YOU--WITH YOU  IT'S ALWAYS, UH... MARIELLA FROSTRUP,  RIGHT? WELL, CALL HER  "SUSAN FROSTRUP." THAT WAY, WHEN  YOU'RE IN BED WITH SUSAN, YOU WON'T SHOUT THE WRONG NAME  WHEN YOU GOT YOUR EYES SHUT. OR YOU COULD CALL HER "GOD." YEAH, THAT'D WORK. ( gasps ) SO IS IT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO THINK ABOUT SOMEBODY ELSE? Jeff: WELL, YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY DOES. THAT'S WHY THERE ARE SO MANY CELEBRITY MARRIAGES. I'M SORRY? WELL, IF YOU FANTASIZE  ABOUT SOMEONE ELSE DURING SEX, AND SO DOES YOUR PARTNER, AND THOSE TWO PEOPLE  THAT YOU'RE FANTASIZING ABOUT HAPPEN TO MEET  WHILE YOU'RE STILL DOING IT, THEY'RE BOUND TO SENSE SOMETHING, AREN'T THEY? BECAUSE THEY'RE CONNECTING  ON LIKE AVIRTUAL PLANE. SO CAN YOU IMAGINE  WHAT IT WAS LIKE WHEN POSH FIRST MET BECKHAM? THEY WERE THE EPICENTER OF A NONSTOP, NATIONWIDE VIRTUAL SHAG! I MEAN IT'S NO WONDER  SHE GOT PREGNANT. WHEN THE VAN COMES  FOR YOU, JEFF,  GO QUIETLY. OKAY. SO I JUST POPPED IN FOR A DRINK WITH SAL BEFORE I GET HOME AND START COOKING. I WASN'T EXPECTING TO SEE YOU. COULD I HAVE A WORD, PLEASE? SURE. YOU GUYS OKAY  FOR DRINKS? YEAH, SURE. CAN I JUST CLARIFY WHEN I SAY DINNER,  I MEAN DINNER. I KNOW THAT. ABSOLUTELY. PLAIN ORDINARY COOKING. WELL, I WASN'T EXPECTING  A FISH COURSE. SO YOU CAN STOP WORRYING ABOUT YOUR SOCKS. I THINK THEY JUST MELTED. A MOTOR SHOW. YEAH. I THOUGHT WE COULD GO TOGETHER. YOU LIKE CARS, RIGHT? EVERYBODY LIKES CARS. WOULD THIS BE  A DATE? I'M SORRY? I'D LOVE TO GO,  PATRICK, BUT STRICTLY  AS YOUR FRIEND. WHAT DO YOU MEAN FRIEND EXACTLY? I WOULDN'T BE YOUR DATE. I'D BE YOUR FRIEND. NO, SORRY, STILL NOT WITH YOU. OKAY. LET'S  TAKE IT SLOWLY. WHAT DO YOU CALL PEOPLE  YOU GO OUT WITH BUT YOU DON'T TRY  TO SLEEP WITH? MEN. NOW, SINCE I'M  ONLY A FRIEND DATE, DO YOU WANT TO  TAKE THIS TICKET BACK  AND GET AN UPGRADE? HEY, NO. WE CAN GO AS THE FRIENDS THING. I'M NEVER GOING  TO SLEEP WITH YOU,  PATRICK-- EVER, EVER, EVER. OKAY, THANKS.  SEE YOU 'ROUND. THAT LOOKED LIKE A DUMPINGCONVERSATION. HOW'D IT GO? SHE TOOK IT OKAY. WOULD YOU CONSIDER A NAKED MAN IN SOCKS? I WOULD CONSIDER ANYTHING  EXCEPT ANIMALS AND TORIES. MAYBE ANGUS DEAYTON.  WHAT? I THINK ANGUS COULD PULL OFF NAKED IN SOCKS. SUSAN, YOU'VE GOT TO  GET PAST THIS ANGUS THING. I'M TRYING! SO HOW'S THE PATRICK THING GOING? IT ISN'T. I TOLD YOU HE WASN'T YOUR TYPE. I'M SURPRISED  HE WAS EVER YOURS. WHAT DID YOU SEE IN HIM. HE'S SO DULL! I NEED PERSONALITY. VERVE, HUMOR. AT LEAST NOW I KNOW WHY  YOU CALLED HIM "DONKEY BRAIN." ACTUALLY, I CALLED HIM "DONKEY." YEAH, BUT I GOT THE POINT. NO, YOU DIDN'T. WHAT? YOU MEAN...YOU MEAN. SOME MEN ARE BORN LUCKY. SOME MEN ARE BORN VERY LUCKY. WHAT WAS PATRICK BORN? A TRIPOD. YOU LET ME DUMP  A TRIPOD! YOU BITCH! OH, COME ON. YOU'D HAVE DUMPED HIM ANYWAY. THERE ARE DIFFERENT LEVELS  OF DUMPING, SUSAN. THERE'S DUMPING,  PLAIN AND SIMPLE, AND THERE'S DUMPING  AFTERWARDS! EXCUSE ME, GIRLS. SEEM TO HAVE  A BIT OF A BALANCE PROBLEM. OKAY. FOREPLAY TIP NUMBER THREE! PLEASE, JEFF,  NO MORE. WHAT, YOU DON'T THINK YOU NEED HELP HERE? SUSAN IS NO ORDINARY WOMAN. I DON'T THINK I NEED THE ADVICE  OF A MAN WHO HAD A PANIC ATTACK AT THE PROSPECT OF SEX WITH HER. LISTEN, DO YOURSELF A FAVOR. WHEN YOU GET TO HER FLAT, CHECK OUT HER REMOTE CONTROLS. HER WHAT? HER REMOTE CONTROLS--YOU KNOW, FOR HER TELLY, HER VIDEO, HER SOUND SYSTEM. CHECK 'EM OUT. WHY? ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT  SUSAN'S REMOTES? OH! OH, YEAH! AMAZING,  ISN'T IT? SCARY!  SCARED ME, TOO! I DIDN'T REALIZE A WOMAN COULD BE THAT SHAMELESS! SO...A MOTOR SHOW,  YOU SAY. I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T WANT TO... GO. I DIDN'T REALIZE  IT WAS SUCH A BIG ONE. SHE'LL BE WITH YOU  IN A MOMENT. WHAT HAPPEN TO PERSONALITY, VERVE AND HUMOR? SOD THEM! AFTER ALL THE MEN  I'VE BEEN OUT WITH, I DESERVE A FULL-SIZE ONE. OKAY. BUT I'M NOT GONNA STAND HERE AND WATCH YOU HUMILIATE YOURSELF. OH, AND JUST ONE THING...  WHAT? PATRICK IS A TORY. WHAT? WELL, HERE WE ALL ARE. I THOUGHT  I'D FIND YOU ALL HERE. HOW'S MY FAVORITE LITTLE EX, HMM? FINE. IT SUCH A GOOD IDEA STAYING FRIENDS WITH EX'S. TAKE IT FROM SOMEONE WHO KNOWS. FRIENDSHIP'S MORE LASTING THAN LOVE, AND MORE LEGAL THAN STALKING. OH! EVERYBODY... I WANT YOU  TO MEET HOWARD. HI. HI.  HELLO. HI. DOES ANYONE KNOW IF THAT BIG GINGER BLOKE IS STILL WORKING BEHIND THE BAR HERE? SOMETIMES. EXCELLENT. HE'S AN EX OF MINE. I THINK I STILL OWE HIM A SLAP. I'LL GET THE DRINKS. OH...ISN'T HE JUST PERFECT? HE'S GORGEOUS! TONIGHT HE'S MINE. JANE, ISN'T HE GAY? FASCIST! NO! I'M JUST SAYING  HE GOES OUT WITH MEN. NOT WOMEN, MEN. DA-DA! I'M BISEXUAL! HOWARD! I DON'T WANT YOU TO GET UNDULY EXCITED, BUT I'M OFF TO COOK. GREAT. YOU CAN COME AND WATCH. IN THAT ORDER. GREAT. ( whispering )  Susan, Susan. HOW TORY? OKAY. HOW BIG? Susan: I THINK WE'RE ALMOST READY. DON'T YOU JUST LOVE OVEN TIMERS? I DON'T THINK  I'VE GOT AN OVEN. THERE'S A SQUARE THING  IN THE KITCHEN, I ALWAYS USED TO PUT BOOKS IN IT TILL THERE WAS  A SLIGHT FIRE INCIDENT. Susan on video:  OH, YES! YES!!! MM! I'M SUCH  A GREAT COOK! OH, I SEE. RIGHT. YOU OKAY? YEAH. JUST, UM... OH, OF COURSE-- A MAN, A TELEVISION. BETTER LEAVE YOU TWO ALONE. IS THERE ANYTHING  I CAN DO? JUST RELAX. SHOULDN'T HAVE GOT YOU HERE SO EARLY. BUT IF SALLY'S GOING TO HUMILIATE HERSELF, I'D RATHER SHE HAD AS SMALL AN AUDIENCE AS POSSIBLE. MY FAULT, REALLY. I TOLD HER SOMETHING ABOUT PATRICK I SHOULDN'T. PROBABLY THE BATTERIES HAVE RUN OUT. YEAH, YEAH. I'LL JUST, UM... THEY'VE ALSO CLIMBED OUT. OH...I'LL HAVE PUT THEM IN SOMETHING ELSE. I'M ALWAYS RUNNING OUT OF BATTERIES. NO...THESE ARE EMPTY, TOO. OH, HANG ON! I THINK I KNOW WHERE THEY ENDED UP. ( loud humming noise ) THERE YOU ARE. THANKS. WHAT AM I THINKING? I'VE JUST BOUGHT SOME NEW ONES! DA-DA! DO YOU FIND  YOUR BATTERIES RUN OUT  REALLY QUICKLY? WELL, I'VE NEVER HAD ANY COMPLAINTS! SORRY? NOTHING. UM, WHAT WAS IT THAT YOU TOLD SALLY ABOUT PATRICK THAT YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE? OH, JUST THAT MY EX  IS A VERY BIG BOY, INDEED. OH... WHY DON'T YOU WATCH THE TELLY. I'M GOING TO  JUMP IN THE SHOWER. THE THING ABOUT BLAIR, RIGHT? THE THING ABOUT BLAIR... IS THIS COUNTRY READY FOR A PRESIDENT? YEAH, I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN. HE WORRIES ME, THAT MAN. THE TORIES HAVE GOT  TO FIND A WAY TO SAVE THE COUNTRY FROM HIM! YES...I SEE YOUR POINT. WHOA. YOU SAID THAT ALL TORIES SHOULD BE DROWNED IN THEIR OWN VOMIT. THAT DOESN'T MEAN  I CAN'T SEE  THEIR POINT OF VIEW. YOU KNOW WHAT  WE NEED NOW? WE NEED  MAGGIE BACK. OH, DEAR GOD!  WHAT'S WRONG WITH  GOOD OL' MAGGIE? YOU CAN'T BE  AGAINST HER,  CAN YOU? PATRICK, IT HAD BETTER BE ENORMOUS! WHAT? THE MOTOR SHOW. IT BETTER BE A REALLY BIG MOTOR SHOW. WHAT ARE YOU SUDDENLY BRINGING UP THE MOTOR SHOW FOR? BECAUSE I HAVE NEVER BEEN TO A MOTOR SHOW WITH A TORY! SO IT HAD BETTER BE A REALLY BIG, ENORMOUS THROBBING MOTOR SHOW! THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING. ( chuckling ) YOU KNOW,  YOU'RE A LOT MORE FUN  WHEN YOU'RE RELAXED. NOT AS FUNNY,  BUT A LOT MORE FUN. THANK YOU. WHAT IS IT ABOUT MEN? I MEAN, YOU'RE SUPPOSED  TO BE THE CONFIDENT ONES. YOU'RE SUPPOSED  TO BE CHASING US. IT TAKES SOME OF  THE EXCITEMENT AWAY IF WE KEEP HAVING TO SHOUT, "HURRY UP!" HANG ON. FIRST DATES ARE MORE STRESSFUL FOR MEN. FOR US, IT'S THE UNKNOWN. FOR US, TOO. NO...YOU KNOW ONE MORE THING THAN WE DO. WHAT? WELL, YOU KNOW... I DON'T. UH...OKAY. UM...YOU'RE ON A DATE, RIGHT? ANY DATE... I'M NOT SAYING THIS DATE IN PARTICULAR. UM, THE GUY IS WONDERING IF HE'S GONNA GET LUCKY. ALL NIGHT THAT'S ALL HE'S THINKING. TRUE. AND THE WOMAN... SHE ALREADY KNOWS. ALSO TRUE. AH, SO YOU SEE... WE'RE DEALING WITH THE UNKNOWN. I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WAS BECAUSE YOU WERE WORRIED  ABOUT YOUR EQUIPMENT. MY--MY WHAT? OH, YOU KNOW... IF HE'S GOING TO FIRE OFF  TOO SOON OR SOMETHING. YOU ARE... YOU REALLY ARE UP FRONT, AREN'T YOU? I MEAN I, PERSONALLY, NEVER HAD ANY WORRIES ABOUT PREMATURE... FIRING. JUST ABOUT THE UNKNOWN. EXACTLY. STEVE?  YEAH? YOU'RE DEFINITELY  GETTING LUCKY TONIGHT. JUST TO TAKE THE PRESSURE OFF. ( stumbling ) WELL...THAT'S GREAT. TH-THAT'S FANTASTIC. THANK YOU. YOU'RE WELCOME. SEE, NOW, I... CAN... RELAX. GREAT. AREN'T YOU GONNA SWALLOW? OH, YEAH, I'M GETTIN' THERE. MAGGIE THATCHER,  IN MY OPINION-- NOW, LISTEN TO THIS, PATRICK, THIS IS THE VOICE OF AN OPPRESSED MINORITY. MAGGIE THATCHER  IS THE BEST PRIME MINISTER THIS COUNTRY HAS EVER HAD! HOW DARE YOU SAY THAT! YOU'RE GAY! YOU'RE ON OUR SIDE! ACTUALLY, SALLY, HOWARD DOESN'T THINK OF HIMSELF AS GAY. YES, I DO. THERE ARE NO HOMOSEXUALS, THERE ARE JUST PEOPLE SEXUALS. NO, JANE. THERE ARE DEFINITELY HOMOSEXUALS. HOWARD! DO YOU WANT GAY MEN  TO BE LABELED? YES. THAT WOULD BE FANTASTIC. MUST BE A LOT EASIER BEING GAY. I MEAN SEX MUST BE A PIECE OF PISS IF YOU'RE GAY. WHY IS THAT? WELL, 'CAUSE, IF YOU'RE GAY, RIGHT? IF YOU'RE GAY, MASTURBATION IS PRACTICE. YOU KNOW... YOU CAN HAVE A GOOD OL' PRACTICE ON YOUR OWN, AND, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU'RE READY, WHEN YOU'VE GOT THE HANG OF IT, YOU HAVE A GO ON SOMEONE ELSE'S. IT'S A PIECE OF PISS. THAT'S A VERY GOOD POINT,  ACTUALLY. NO, IT'S NOT. IT'S HOMOPHOBIC, YOU STUPID QUEEN! IT IS NOT IN THE LEAST BIT HOMOPHOBIC. HELLO!  THERE'S NO SUCH THING  AS HOMOPHOBIA! THERE'S JUST PEOPLE PHOBIA. SEE, IT'S DIFFERENT. IT'S DIFFERENT WHEN YOU'RE A STRAIGHT BLOKE. WHEN WE FINALLY GET OUR HANDS ON THE GEAR, LET ME TELL YOU, IT'S NOT A DRILL. GAYS HAVE GOT THEIR OWN PRACTICE KIT, BUT YOU DON'T GET ANY PRACTICE WOMEN. WE'RE SUPPOSED TO FLY THOSE BABIES THE FIRST TIME WE GET IN THEM. ( laughing ) Sally: THAT'S NOT FUNNY! "GET IN THEM" IS NOT FUNNY! OH, DON'T BE SO P.C.! TYPICAL LEFTY PURITAN. TYPICAL WHAT? COME THE REVOLUTION. WHAT REVOLUTION?  YOU GUYS ARE IN POWER. WE'RE THE REVOLUTION NOW. NO. NO, THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT. YOU'RE  THE EVIL EMPIRE. NO! YES. LIKE STAR WARS, AND PATRICK AND ME  ARE THE REBEL ALLIANCE. ( singing Star Wars theme ) NO! YOU'RE NOT THE GOODIES.  WE'RE THE GOODIES! WE'RE LEFTIES!  WE'RE ALWAYS GOODIES! ( Darth Vader's voice )  NO, SALLY, YOU ARE  THE ESTABLISHMENT! DON'T SAY THAT, YOU BASTARD! YOU CAN'T CALL ME  BASTARD ANYMORE.  THAT'S OPPRESSIVE. OH, YOU'RE OPPRESSING ME! ARE YOU GOING TO THE LOO? YEAH. WAIT AND GO WITH PATRICK. THERE'S SOMETHING  I NEED TO KNOW. WHAT? JUST WAIT AND GO WITH PATRICK! SO WHAT ABOUT JANE? JANE? YOU'RE EX. I MEAN, SHE'S VERY BEAUTIFUL. HOPE I CAN MEASURE UP. I HOPE I CAN MEASURE UP  TO YOUR EX. PATRICK. OH, HE'S SWEET. IT'S ALWAYS KIND OF DIFFICULT MEETING YOUR PREDECESSORS, ISN'T IT? YEAH. I, UH, I USED TO GO OUT WITH THIS GIRL YEARS AGO... HER EX WAS  LIKE THIS BIG,  MUSCLE-BOUND GOD. I WAS REALLY INTIMIDATED TILL SHE TOLD ME THAT EVERY TIME THEY WERE IN BED TOGETHER, AND HE WAS ON HIS WAY IN,  SO TO SPEAK, HE USED TO GO GERONIMO! AFTER SHE TOLD ME THAT,  IT WASN'T REALLY A PROBLEM. YEAH. I REMEMBER PATRICK DOING SOMETHING LIKE THAT. REALLY? WHAT? WELL, EVERY TIME HE WAS MAKING AN ENTRANCE, AS IT WERE, HE SAY, "JUST SAY WHEN." ANYWAY... THAT'S ENOUGH CHAT. ABOUT EX'S. ABOUT ANYTHING. JANE, I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND. THERE'S SOMETHING I NEED TO GET STRAIGHT. NOT AT ALL.  THIS IS MUCH MORE ROMANTIC. YEAH. UM... YOU SEE, I'M BEGINNING TO THINK THERE'S BEEN A BIT OF A MISUNDERSTANDING HERE. THIS IS NOT A DATE. OH...GOD! OH! THERE HAS BEEN  A MISUNDERSTANDING,  HOWARD! THIS IS A DATE! JANE, I'M GAY! NO PROBLEM.  SO AM I. NO, YOU'RE NOT. WELL, I'M A LITTLE BIT GAY. AND IF YOU WERE, THAT WOULD BE TWO PROBLEMS. HOMOPHOBE. NO, HOMOSEXUAL. OH, HOWARD, I KNOW YOU'RE A HOMOSEXUAL. IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU  DON'T GO OUT WITH WOMEN JUST LIKE ANY OTHER MAN. LOOK. LOOK OVER THERE. TWO STRAIGHT MEN-- THEY GO OUT WITH WOMEN. YOU DON'T EXPECT THEM TO GO OUT WITH EACH OTHER, DO YOU? YES, OF COURSE, I DO,  IF IT'S CONVENIENT. NO! NO, YOU DON'T! I EXPECT THEY'RE ALWAYS  NIPPING OFF TOGETHER  FOR A CUDDLE. IT'S JUST YOU  THAT'S NARROW-MINDED. JANE, I AM GAY! AND I'VE ALWAYS,  ALWAYS BEEN GAY. I WAS THE SPERM AT THE BACK, SHOUTING, "NO, DON'T SEND ME INTO THAT BIG, SCARY CAVE!" I WAS THE ONLY SPERM THAT HAD TO BE CHASED BY THE EGG. DON'T YOU GET IT? I'M GAY! WELL, YOU CERTAINLY SEEM TO BE UNDER THAT IMPRESSION. YOU LIKE PORTILLO? I NEARLY CRIED  WHEN HE LOST  HIS SEAT. THAT'S ILLEGAL! HANG ON. DON'T GO YET! YOU'VE GOT TO GO WITH PATRICK!

LOOK, I NEED YOU  TO DO SOMETHING FOR ME. WHAT? WHEN PATRICK GOES TO THE LOO,  CAN YOU GO WITH HIM? JEFF? JEFF? CAN I SIT HERE? SURE, NO PROBLEM. IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE SOMEONE OPEN-MINDED AT THE TABLE... SOMEONE FLEXIBLE. IT'S REALLY WEIRD TONIGHT! PEOPLE ARE BEHAVING A LITTLE ODDLY, I MUST SAY. I'M GLAD SOMEONE ELSE  HAS NOTICED. OH, LOOK, JEFF... PATRICK'S GONE  TO THE LOO. WHY DON'T YOU  GO WITH HIM? HAVE A BIT  OF A CUDDLE. I NEED YOU! UM... I WAS JUST... MM-HMM. BUT CAN IT  MOW THE LAWN?
