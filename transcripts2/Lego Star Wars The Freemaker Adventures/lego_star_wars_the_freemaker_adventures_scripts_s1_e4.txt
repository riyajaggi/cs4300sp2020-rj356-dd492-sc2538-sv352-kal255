 The invasion of Cloud City is a go. Launch all fighters. Attention. The Empire has taken control of the city. I advise everyone to leave before more Imperial troops arrive. Ugh! Why do they hate us? Don't take it personal. It's just part of the job. Don't let me down, Lobot. That cargo must not fall into Imperial hands. Freeze! Focus. You must focus.

 and, with only 50 billion light-years, it's still under warranty. We can buff that out. Ugh! Another sale blown! It's just a little slump. Something will come along. It always does. Oh, it better. Or we'll have to sell Roger to pay the rent. - Pardon? - Sell Roger? Focus! There is nothing more important than this. You must force the pieces together... with the, uh, Force. Not being redundant there. I have to take this. Continue your training. Blast! I just can't do it. Ow! You got a reason for bouncing parts off my tail pipe? Sorry, Zander. It's just... this Force stuff is so hard!

 - And kicking helps? - A little. I just don't want to let Naare down. This is so important to her. This is so important to me. Why haven't you located more Kyber Saber crystals? The boy's skills are weak. He requires training. Eh... Correct me if I'm wrong, Naare, but so far, he's found all the crystals when you were nowhere near him. Isn't that right? Well, yes. I suppose that's true. Maybe it's just my Sith nature that makes me paranoid, but I wonder... Instead of you deceiving the boy, perhaps it is he who is deceiving you. No, I-I'm certain that is not the case. Then prove it. Find those crystals. I will check your progress again soon. Status report! What have you done since we last spoke? Hmm? Maybe you're looking at it the wrong way. Maybe you can't force the Force. - Know what I mean? - No. I mean, maybe you should take your mind off the whole thing for a bit. Ooh, I know! You should do what I do whenever I'm feeling down. Whoo! Podraces! Did you see that, Rowan? I didn't see anything. I know! That BT-310 is blazing fast. You feel better already, right? Actually, I kinda don't know how... To thank me? No need. You're my brother. Just don't tell Kordi I brought you down here. She has this thing about the Lower Ring being dangerous. Ooh! I just don't see it. Aaah! Ha-ha! I'm still alive! Whoo-hoo! - I'm gonna go take a look around. - 'Kay, but hurry back. You don't want to miss the battle lap. Whoo-hoo! I love podracing! It's an easy grab-and-go job. Data reports indicate Cloud City is under Imperial lockdown. Which is why I can't go back there. I left some precious cargo behind, and I'll pay a small fortune to whoever retrieves it. A small fortune? That'd bring a smile to Kordi's face. This cargo is of vital importance to me and the Rebel Alliance. And Chewbacca. Negative. My programming forbids aiding the Alliance. Me too. Forget it. I gotta get outta here. No way. I'm out. Hello. I'm an appropriately tall adult person capable of retrieving this precious cargo. I'm sorry, Mr. Appropriately Tall. I'm only hiring real adult persons. Looks to me like you're not hiring anybody. I've got a ship and a crew, and we could handle your grab-and-go job, no problem. Is that real enough for you? Is everyone on your crew as tall as you? Taller. I know we just had lunch, but you know what I could go for? Uh... second lunch? Yeah! Tell me what I want to hear! Um, everyone thinks you're cooler than Boba Fett. - Nobody laughs at that diaper on your head. Just telling you what you want to hear, Dengar. Twelve systems searched, and we still haven't found the little twerp! What am I gonna tell Graballa? Tell him we found a great snack stand. Good jawa juice. Yeah. Good variety. Oh, and we heard about a job with a big payoff. How big? Any moment now. Any moment. So exciting. - Come on! We've got a job. - But they're just about to... Aw! The pods! I missed them! No point in staying then. Come on! A real job! You took Rowan to the Lower Ring? Why not give him death sticks, while you're at it? It was brother bonding time? And I landed us a job. An easy in and out. Come on, Kordi. We gotta do this! Oh, we're taking this Lando guy's job. You had me at "small fortune." But you ever take Rowan to the Lower Ring again, I'll launch you into hyperspace with my boots! Come on, come on! Into the ship already! - Roger, you mind the shop. - Waah! We don't want anyone getting there before us, so tell no one. Roger, roger. This isn't a salvage mission, so no sense lugging the cargo carrier all the way to Bespin. Right. Keep it lean and mean. Separation in three, two, one. Remember, Roger, tell no one where we're going or what we're doing. - Are we clear on that? - Crystal clear. Your secret is safe with me. Secret? What secret? There's no secret at all. Not on Cloud City. Nuh-uh! We are crystal clear on that. Crystal? On Cloud City? I wasn't supposed to say anything. I can't stop telling secrets. Much better. Has Rowan sensed a Kyber Saber crystal on Cloud City? But why would he keep that a secret from me? Unless... Does he know the truth? Pretty smooth. Aaah! Welcome aboard. This is your captain, Zander. We're off to Cloud City where today's forecast is cloudy... with a chance of fortune! If the Freemakers plan to double-cross me, they will rue the day. Strap in, boys. Next stop, Cloud City. Aw! You're trying too hard. How 'bout you give it a rest and take us out of hyperspace instead? Really? I've never... You can do it. Just push forward on that lever. Easy. Nice, Rowan. Welcome to Bespin. Ha! Snuck in without even being... Halt! This is a restricted facility. You were saying? Detected. I was gonna say "detected." - Freemaker Salvage and Repair at your service. We got a maintenance request for your... Oh, this is embarrassing. Zander, did you forget to charge this? Blast. I did. Sorry, Kordi. And I can't remember what the order was for. Help us out, fellas. What around here needs repairs? Nothing. Get back in your ship and get outta here. Oh. Okay. We get paid all the same, and I like free money. Good luck explaining to the Emperor why he paid us for doing nothing. I understand he's very forgiving. Uh... Sir, the carbon-freezing chamber has been on the fritz. Right! The carbon-freezing chamber. That's what it was. Whew, that was a close one, right? Say, shame what they pay you troopers. How'd you feel about a little donation to your retirement fund? At your service, ma'am. We'll notify the Emperor that you have arrived. You will inform the Emperor of nothing. We will inform the Emperor of nothing. You will go for a long march off a short platform. We will go for a long march off a short platform. Waah! Waah! Aaah! ♪ Whoa. I was not prepared for... this. Naare! Why are you on Cloud City? Taking a holiday? I don't recall signing a vacation request form. It's not a vacation, Master. I'm actively searching for a Kyber Saber crystal. On Cloud City? Hey, is the food court still open? How naive do you think I... - We're not here for food. - We're here for precious cargo. Nothing's more precious than one's health, boss. Right. And three square meals is key to that goal. How did I get stuck with you two knuckle-horns? Well, I'm just saying that my body reacts very strongly if I skip meals or fast. Did you put me on mute? I would never mute you, Master. Okay. What did I just say then, hmm? That... you would blast my midi-chlorians to the four corners of the galaxy if I didn't show results soon? Ooh. She's good. Lucky guess. Oh. Buttons! What are you doing? That's a repulsorlift generator! Messing with that could send the whole city plummeting! We know that. But we can't fix your carbon-freezing chamber if your repulsorlift generator isn't properly calibrated, right? Ah! Looks fine. Good work, Rowan. ♪ ♪ Hello, precious. Who's in here? Eh, sounds like a carbon clog. Hope it doesn't blow, or we'll end up colder than a tauntaun's tail. I don't know. Might be mynocks, in which case we'll have to fumigate. Yeah, it might be mynocks or it might nock be mynocks. They've got this. Want to go do some target practice? Sure! Last time I almost hit something. I wonder how Kordi's doing. Whoops! I'm sure she's got it under control. Just like we do. I thought you heard something. I was following you. Nice quarters. Uh, just what I feared. Itch mites. Uh, itch mites? Yeah. This place is infested with them. I'll fill out a work order, and then we'll fumigate. Let me just grab my tool kit and I'm out. Somebody doesn't look very Imperial. Nice case too. Precious cargo. Hey, Zander? You're not going to believe this, but I think I've actually discovered what's wrong with this chamber. - It's not mynocks? - I know. Weird, right? Look. Somehow that coolant tube got cut in two. Huh. I can reach it from here. Hold on. I got this. Ugh! Why do I even try? I'm just not good enough. Hey. Look, Rowan! You totally did it. I did? I used the For... Aaah! Huh? Rowan, no! What have I done? Hey! Looks like you fixed it. Good job! Great news! I got the goods. sorry, buddy. No, I got the goods! No, I will take the Kyber Saber crystal! - What? - You know, for safekeeping. Kyber Saber crystal? Is that what's in the case? - Isn't it? -Zander, why is Rowan frozen in carbonite? What are you doing here, and why are these guys with you? We're not with her. We're just looking for precious cargo. And lunch. Is this the food court? One Mygeeto burrito, please. Um, maybe it's 'cause I can't hear so good in this helmet, but I'm very confused. Isn't that the kid Graballa wants? It is! Take them both! - Rowan! - The crystal! - The case! -My burrito! - I surrender! First you try to take the crystals for yourself. Then you lose the only link to them? Why would we try to take the crystals? Um... That's a good question. Argue later. They got Rowan. How did they get back there? Naare! What's new? Enjoying Cloud City, hmm? Good, good. Also, where are my crystals? Uh, you're breaking up. Losing signal. Gotta go now! Faster, you slugs! - Hand over the crystal! - My pleasure! Get the kid to the ship! Come back with our brother! All these hallways look the same. Some color coding would be nice. They're getting away! Uh! Not that way! Oh, right. Sorry. They'll figure that out before we get over there. Come on! I've got an idea! Do his ideas ever work? Be honest. Um... 50/50? - Ah! I can't remember which one it was! No time to do this gently. Are you mad? What have you done? Shut down the repulsorlift generator. Seemed like the smart play. - Though I might be wrong about that! What's going on? Best guess... Somebody forgot to pay their power bill. Here they come! We got Rowan! But we still don't have that precious cargo. Aaah! Move aside. I've got this! Oh, Freemakers, what would you do with... Yes! You broke the repulsorlift generator. Can you fix it? Not if I can't reach it. If Naare hadn't picked this moment to visit dreamland, she could "use the Force." - Rowan could do it if he wasn't frozen. - So, unfreeze him. You can do that? Where am I? I can't see anything. You've got carbonite sickness. How did that happen? Yeah, funny story. You'll laugh. But later. Right now we need you to use the Force to reconnect those repulsorlift generator cables. Use the Force, when I can't see? Maybe the Force doesn't need you to see, Rowan. Maybe it's not what you see. Maybe it's what you feel. I told you, I'm not good enough. Or we could just plummet to our doom. Your call. When you put it that way... You can do this, Rowan. I know you can. We're right here with you. Whoa! - You did it! - You saved the city! And I used the Force! You were right, Zander. I was looking at it all wrong. It's almost as if my eyes were, you know, deceiving me. And that's why you're my hero, little brother. Hmm. Well done, Freemakers. You'll be handsomely rewarded, of course. Yes! Handsome rewards make me happy. Though I can also live with ugly rewards. I don't judge rewards. And now to be reunited with... Is it a crystal? My precious cargo! A cape? Can't fight the Empire without the right style. And now I don't have to wear Han's old clothes! That makes you happy too, huh, Chewie? Oh! You like that cape? I can get you one just like it. I know a guy. Well, it wasn't a total loss. I know who the mysterious boy is. Rowan Freemaker. And if I ever get out of here, I might even tell Graballa. Cloud City prison food ain't so bad. Mmm, five stars. I'd eat here again. Huh?
