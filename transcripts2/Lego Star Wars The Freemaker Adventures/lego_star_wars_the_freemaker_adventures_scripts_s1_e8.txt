 (electronic chirping) Good morning. (beeps) (beeping) Leave it! We've gotta go now! Hello? It's Naare. - Everything all right in there? - It's Naare! Stall her. Uh, yes. Everything is fine. Thank you for asking. Um, could you come back in an hour or two? Or tomorrow? Roger, what's going on? Open this door!

 Uh, can't because, uh, we're all, um, asleep. - You're asleep? - Yes. Uh, that's me snoring. Roger! Well, I'm sorry. Nobody programmed me to lie well. Rowan. What's going on? - I know. - Know what? You are not a Jedi. Of course not, Rowan. The Jedi are all gone. Destroyed... by people like me! Whoa! Oh! Whoa! Now save the droid!

 (roars) Go! Go, go, go! I'm trying! (angry screaming) (beeps) - Whoa! - Is that Naare? Who else would be shooting at us? I don't know. Graballa. Dengar. The Empire. Furlac. We are not popular. He's got a point. (explosion) (cackling) We just lost our rear deflector. It's not like I'm trying to get hit! I'll lose her in traffic. - Zander! - I know, I know! I see it. Told ya she's evil. I'll keep it simple, Freemakers. You can't outrun me. You can't outgun me. So give me Rowan, and I may let some of you live. - Here's our counterproposal, Sith. What? (angry screaming) Finish me, Freemakers, or I'll hunt you from one side of the galaxy to the other! Blast her! Blast her to dust! (rapid beeping) (Naare gasping) (grunting, screaming) Naare! How goes the search for my Kyber Saber crystals? Uh, great. Couldn't be better. And the boy? Full of surprises. So what do we do now? Do we keep looking for the crystals? - Where do we even go? - Not home. Not while Naare's after us. I still can't believe it. How can someone that beautiful be that evil? I mean, a little evil, I get. I even... I even like a little, tiny bit of evil. But that evil? It's like my whole galaxy has just been turned upside down. I told you, you can't trust Jedi. They were the bad guys in the Clone Wars, after all. Roger, Naare's not a Jedi. She's a Sith. And in the Clone Wars, battle droids were the bad guys. We were? But I... Wait. This is overheating my logic circuits. I'm gonna stop thinking about it. Gah! Hey, guys. What's new? Wish I could forget all this so easily. I had a bad feeling about Naare from the moment I set eyes on her. Not me. She told me I was gonna be a Jedi. She told me I was going to save the galaxy. She made me feel... Special? Yeah. But... that was just another one of her lies. I'm not special. I'm not... anything. Rowan... - Aaah! It's Naare! - She found us! No, but it's almost as bad. We just lost the quantum field regulator! Hang on! This could get bumpy! Come on! You can do it, baby! (shouting) No, no, no, no, no! Brakes! Brakes! Where are the brakes? Come on! Please stop! Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop! (all sighing) A near-perfect landing. And you guys were worried. Ha-ha! Zander Freemaker, superstar pilot guy! Right? Hey! Watch where you land that scrap pile! (snarls) Ah... I am so sorry! Ah. Oh, good. It's just a scratch. I can fix your ship, no problem. - It's not our ship. - It's our captain's. And there's your problem. (gasping) Why can't anything ever be easy? Captain, sir. This kid crashed into your ship. "Crashed" is way overstating it. It's more like "tapped," even "kissed," like... Well, accidents happen. What are you going to do? (chuckling) Oh, good. I thought you'd be... You're going to pay. That's what you're going to do. I can't pay you! Oh, good news for you. o money! I accept blood, limbs, next of kin. Let go of my brother! Brave kid. If he was a little taller, I'd add him to my crew. (laughing) Now, Hondo, I know you're not going to start any trouble in my place... again. My dearest Maz, I have no idea what you are talking about. - Maybe a little. - Don't you even! Last time, I was pulling teeth out of the walls for weeks. So work it out, peacefully. Maz, Maz. Be reasonable. What could these poor, broke children ever do for me? We could do business, Captain Hondo, is it? Kordi Freemaker, Freemaker Salvage and Repair. You've probably heard of us. You need something, anything, hire us, and we'll get it for you. Satisfaction guaranteed! Guarantee not actual or binding. You crash into my ship, and now you want me to give you a job? I almost like this one. How do I know you won't just fly off and leave me high and dry? This should be good. You can keep our ship as collateral. Its hyperdrive is broken anyway. This is working out just fine. Very well, Freemaker Salvage and... whatever. I have a job for you. I would like for you to get me a little something from, uh, the third moon. (laughing) Lost, child? Um, no. No one's allowed in there but me. Sorry. I thought I felt a... A what? Nothing. But we're on Takodana. There's not supposed to be a... Never mind. Hmm. Three golden orbs? Yeah. Hondo says there are dozens of them in a sinkhole on the third moon. So, why doesn't he get them himself? Because there's going to be a catch, Rowan. There always is. We just don't see it yet. Hop in. (all grunting) Where am I supposed to sit? May I suggest the roof? Uh-uh. Not doing that again. Hey! Get off my feet! Seriously. Okay. Here we go. Oops. Go! Oh. Perfect. (explosion) Time to settle the score, Freemakers! Well, score's settled. I feel good about it. - You feel good? - Oh, I feel good. Uh, I'm so-so. Who asked you? Shh. All right! So we're all good! We'll just show ourselves out and... You've come for the Freemaker boy. No! Where did you get... You're out... No! Okay, well, yes, but, actually, I don't care about the boy. What I care about are those Saber Kyber crystals. Kyber Saber crystals. As I said, "sabadacas." I don't care. I don't track the details. The point is, they're my ticket to... Graballa's Beachside Resort and Buffet! ♪ You missed your cue. It's my dream. Don't judge. Anyway, dream becomes reality when I sell the Emperor all those rare little crystals. The only problem is, I can't find them without the boy. That makes two of us. Unfortunately, he's gone. Perhaps we can help each other, my friend. You see, my ship is in need of repair. And, sadly, I'm less of a fixer and more of a breaker. Uh-huh. If your men can fix my ship, I'll let you have half of the Kyber Saber crystals. Half? Not bad. Except... you can't find the crystals. Ah, but I can find the boy. Scary lady, you got yourself a deal. Roger, for the last time, get your elbow out of my back! I would, but if I move my elbow, then... Ow! Your knee is in my ribs! Which leads to... Hey, you're standing on my neck! See? There's no winning here. Fine. Zander, set us down. Uh, do you see the sinkhole? No, all I can see is Roger's leg. But if I don't get out of this ship right now, I'm going to scream. (all groaning) That hurt... everywhere. Anybody seen my servo processor? Don't ask where it was. You don't want to know. Guys? I found the sinkhole. Great! And not so great. (roaring) Wild varactyls. Strong. Deadly. Carnivorous. And there's your catch. Oh, how are we going to get the golden orbs out of that mess? Um, this may be a stupid question, but do varactyls... sleep? (snoring) Let me get this straight. You need me to be the "snipe spotter"? Yep! Don't want anybody sniping those golden orbs before we grab 'em. That's boring. Give me Roger's job. Deal! No deal. We need you to do this, Rowan. If one pirate wants those orbs, other pirates probably want them too, and we can't afford to get sniped. So, spot those snipes. Fine. Fire her up, Zander! Yah! If it's any consolation, I wish it were you doing this job too! (sighs) (whimpering) - "Snipe spotter"? -Look, the poor kid's been through a lot. He's shaken. He needs to sit this one out for his own good. - I guess. - Look out! Plus, this is not gonna be a blue milk run. This might be dangerous. - Yeah. - Aaah! It's not like we've got room in here to spare. Zander! - Okay, I can't argue with that. - Kordi! Zander! - (growls) - (both gasp) (sighs) Bored. Bored. Bored. Bored. Bored. Bored. Bored. Bored. Bored. Bored. Bored. Bored. Bored. Roger, you ready? - Does it matter if I say "no"? - Nope. No, it doesn't. See anything? Yes. I see a lot of things. A whole lot of things! Golden orbs? Roger, roger. Grab three. No, strike that. Grab five! Eight! Grab as many as you can carry. Oh! Then grab more! Kordi, didn't Hondo say he only needed three? We still need a quantum field regulator, and those aren't cheap. Okay, pull me up. Yeah, but why get greedy? It's not greedy when you're desperate. Whoa! Whoa! Ah. Ah. Ah! Wh... Whoa! Whoa! (roaring) Bored. Bored. Bored. (Roger screaming) Okay, maybe it was a little greedy. - Thrusters! Hit the thrusters! - I am! I am! Aaah! Oh, no. (roaring) (gasps) Stop! How much of this... Oof... can we take? If I'm being optimistic, not much. Oh! Not much at all. (screaming) Okay, I get you're upset, but that was uncalled for. I hope the Force is with me. Yah! Claws off my family! Look, I don't wanna hurt you. I really don't. So I'm just going to take three of these orb thingies, and... And... and... You've got so many. Why do you even care? I mean, what are they to you? Rowan? I... I feel... pain, fear. This... This... This is wrong, Kordi. The varactyls, they're just protecting their family. Like we do. Rowan! What are you doing? The right thing. I'm sorry. We didn't know these are... eggs. (chirping) Oh. That changes everything. (squealing) You were wrong, Rowan. Kordi, we couldn't just take their eggs! We'll find some other way to pay off Hondo and get the StarScavenger fixed. You didn't let me finish. You were wrong... when you said you aren't special. You're the most special kid in the whole galaxy. Yeah, I'd pat you on the back, but, uh... Working on it. I'm working on it. So, I blasted him out of the airlock and said, "Well, you win. Now you've got all the space you need!" (laughing) Hondo! Those orbs are eggs! - And you knew it! - Of course I knew it. - You didn't? - No! Oh, this is embarrassing for you. Varactyl eggs fetch a handsome price on the black market. So, where are my eggs? Where they belong... With their families! We're not doing that job. I don't care what we did to your ship! Reminder... barely a scratch. We can work out some other deal. Yes, off of the howling success of this one. (all laughing) I don't think you are very good at understanding things. I sent you for three golden orbs. Now, regretfully, I must settle for three broken heads. Gentlemen... Ow! Hondo! Where did she learn to throw like that? Did I hear you say you sent these kids out for golden orbs? Kids! You don't see anything wrong with that? Yes, I do. They didn't bring me any. Can you believe... Ow! Oh! Get out, and don't come back till I'm done being mad at you. But, Maz, Maz, Maz, how can you be mad at me... Oh! When I'm so charming and... Ow! Okay, we're going, we're going! My goodness. We've got to hide the mugs. No decency left in this galaxy, I swear. You three, follow me. Look, I can't have you kids here. It's bad for business, worse for you. So tell me what it is you need. Right now, we need a quantum field regulator. Is that all? - What type? - Um, double-A type? For a Class "D" salvage ship? Double-A type. Take it. Whoa. Hey, what else you got in there? Nothing for you, flyboy. Your little brother, on the other hand, I like his smile. And I love the way he stood up to Hondo. That kind of spirit deserves something. I think you'll like this. A Kyber Saber crystal! Is that what this old thing is? I thought it was just a pretty rock. Found it on Rodia ages ago. How can we ever thank you? For starters, you can leave. Don't get me wrong. I like you. You're nice kids. But two things we don't do here... nice and kids. So off you go. Thanks, Maz. You're welcome, sweetie. Child. The quest for the Kyber Saber crystals is a worthy pursuit. But when you get desperate, and you will get desperate, seek out the Maker of Zoh. The Maker of... Zoh? "Zoh"? Zoh what? Did I say something? Must be losing it in my old age. Bye! The Maker of Zoh. Rowan, keep up! I'm coming!
