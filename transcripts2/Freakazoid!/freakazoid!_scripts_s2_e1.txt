 [GIGGLES] Aw, Freak. NARRATOR: Our story begins like many others... ...here at Harry Connick Jr. High School... ...where Dexter Douglas is about to ask the most important question of his life. Would you like to, you know, kind of go out with me? Like on a date? Gee, Dex, have you ever been on a date before? No. But I've been practicing. [CHUCKLING] Oh, Stephanie... ...that is so funny.

 Teeny weenie? - Well, I guess I could go. - Oh, great. When? When? [GULPS] STEPHANIE: I can't believe you remembered. - I put it in my computer. Ow. Ooh. Great. - Duncan, quit it. - Oh. Am I ruining your little date? - Dad. - Duncan, mind your apples, huh? DUNCAN: Oh, I never get to have any fun. [LAUGHING] Jerry. Don't touch that dial. For the next 60 minutes, I'm in control. [LOBE LAUGHING] - Come on, Kramer, give me the doughnut. - Never.

 The key to the whole show is Newman. We got it plugged in, boss, just like you said. LOBE: Very good, Medulla. Now, with just a flick of the switch, my video sapper will steal every movie... ...every program, every broadcast ever produced. Not only will I be able to flood the market with counterfeit cassettes... ...crippling the entertainment industry... ...but I'll never have to program my VCR again. [LAUGHING] MEDULLA: It's working. [GRUNTING] NARRATOR: Meanwhile, back on Dexter's date: Don't forget your allergy to sheet cakes, hon. - Yes, Mother. - Have a good time, now. - You're allergic to sheet cakes? - Just the pan. Have a good time, now. Welcome to the Washington Gardens. You have a reservation? Douglas. Dexter Douglas. Who put all this in Latin? Ah, yes, your mommy made the reservation. She says you're having a big, fancy first date. Ha-ha-ha. Have a good time, now. And this must be the lucky lady, princess girl. [WHISPERING] Don't worry, my dear. Oh, we'll make this the most romantic night of your life. No, don't. [IN NORMAL VOICE] Unfortunately, your table won't be ready for a few minutes. Why don't you two lovely pigeons wait here in the lounge? There. Oh, that's so nice. [STATIC CRACKLING] Hello? Hello? ! hope someone can hear me. I'm operating the minicam with my tibia. The Lobe has taken over the network. I repeat, The Lobe has taken over-- [LOBE READING ON-SCREEN TEXT] I, uh, gotta potty. I'll be right back. MAN: I'm not finished. - Oh. Sorry. DEXTER: Oh, Freak out. Time to wash my hands. [HUMMING] All that's left is to steal the last season of Bonanza. The ones featuring David Canary as Candy. [COUGHING] Hello? Lobe? Is this the right room? Freakazoid, look what you've done. Sorry. I'm in a hurry. There's a door not 10 feet away. A fine invention. You should try it. Okay. I'm pulling the plug on your little fiendish scheme. But aren't we going to fight? You know, have a struggle of some sort? I don't have time. I gotta get back. I'm on a date. But that's not fair. I went through all the trouble of planning this amazing, brilliant crime. - The least you could do is chase me around. - Next time. We'll make a night of it. - We'll have a really big fight. - Oh, "next time." Pooh. [GRUNTING] [YELPING] [GIBBERING] Sky. Sky. Sky. Lobe. Zapper. Hello, Lobe. - Hey. Freakazoid. - Oh., hi, Cosgrove. The Lobe's inside, all packed up and ready to go. Once we're done here, you wanna get a fat-free yogurt? I can't. I gotta get back to my date. Next time. [GIBBERING] How about you kids? Wanna get a yogurt? All right. Maybe later. The Lobe, he's escaped. What a thoroughly unsatisfying evening this has turned out to be. - Where to now, boss? Back to the hideout? - The hideout? Oh, that's all we ever do. "Back to the hideout." I'm sick of the hideout. Why don't we do anything fun anymore? You wanna go by the video store and see if they got Guarding Tess? No. You're not listening. I want to go out. I want to have some fun. I want to sing. I want to dance. BOTH: Dance? - I know. The Washington Gardens. We haven't been there in ages. Whoa, whoa, whoa. The Washington Gardens? Oh, but, boss, that joint is crawling with people. - You're a wanted criminal. - I don't care. Call Francois. Tell him... Tell him Lobey's coming back. Is the gentleman still going tinky? Yeah. Could you check on him for me, see if he's all right? Of course. MAN: Not yet. - Ooh. Sorry. FREAKAZOID: Freak in. DEXTER: Uh-oh. I think we have a problem here. Zoids! I look like Oprah Winfrey. Oh, Freak out. Okay, let's not panic! Try it again. Freak in. Yes. David Letterman? Oh, Freak out. Why can't I change back into Dexter? Hmm... Of course. The Lobe's video sapper must've shorted one of my circuits. Come on out of there, Dexter. You're on a date. Freak in. Oh, it's me. I'm back. Oh, am I glad to see you. Aha! You have been in here practicing. Come. The girl, she waits for you. I found him. - Who? - Your date. That's not my date. Ha-ha-ha. Of course it-- - Skipper Alan Hale? - What? Oh, no. Goodbye, little buddies. Hmm. But I had him. [YELLING] Oh, Freak out. Dexter, come out of there right now. Hey, what are you doing? The girl, she thinks you don't like her. - Come. - Whaa! - Here he is. - That's not him. Of course it-- Your Honor. - I am so sorry. - Me too. See you. I think I am going crazy! Attention, waiters. I have the most wonderful of newses. This very evening, after an absence of many years... ...we will once again play host to our favorite guest. ALL: You mean...? [SPEAKS IN FRENCH] The Lobe. [CHEERING] - He's here. - All right. You all know what to do. Go greet our guest. [CHATTERING IN FRENCH] Freak in. Aw, Freak out. Meanwhile, as poor Freakazoid strained, grunted and groaned... ...in his feeble attempt to change back into mild-mannered Dexter Douglas... ...The Lobe, that super-smart, sinister villain with the pink, fleshy head... ...arrived at the Washington Gardens and was about to do the unthinkable.

FREAKAZOID: Psst. Freakazoid. Happen to catch my little number? Look, you gotta help me. That video-sapper thingy of yours shorted me out. I keep popping into different people. I can't change back into my alter ego. It's ruining my date. Ah, yes, that would be a consequence. - It's easily rectified, however. - It is? How? Before I tell you, you have to do something for me. - What? - We have some unfinished business... ...from earlier this evening. - I want you to chase me. - You gotta be kidding me.
