 - Previously on - Previously on "Family Karma"... - Our parents basically founded this community. They had arranged marriages. We have arranged friendships. - Ew! - Please have a child. - I've moved home and regressed 12 years. - I check all the boxes for my parents. But the most important box, bringing a daughter-in-law-- nope. Option C, Nicholas.

 - I think it would be nice to be engaged within the next 12 months. - Uh... You know, sometimes you love the person but you want, "What else is there?" Like, "Is there something else out there?" - You're not wearing flannel. - You don't put all of this in flannel. - Are you guys getting married? - Definitely in our future. - What are you guys talking about? - Not you. - Are you guys dating? - These past couple months, I just started looking at her differently. Look at this new and improved Brian. Are you saying there's no shot?

 - I see you as a friend. - Monica's like the daughter my mom never had. She cooks. She's veg. She doesn't have sex. I know how to do all those things--I just don't do them. - The person to your left-- predict where they're gonna be at 2:00 a.m. tonight. - Monica will be in Brian's room. Oh, sh--! - Right now, Anisha, I kind of don't like you. - Good to know. - Oh, my God. - Richa is the love of my life. I want to plan a traditional engagement ceremony. - Why don't you call my mom and ask her first? - I wish we could just brush everything underneath the rug. - I was really taken back by Lopa. What was she thinking? - I have tried my best to be civil, but I feel like she doesn't give a sh-- about what's important for the kids. - What do you think I should do when your mom comes to my house? - Let your balls drop and become a man. - What? - If I tell you to leave Vishal, are you gonna leave him? Marriage means two families together. But they try to cut me out. Two things I don't tolerate-- lies and disrespect. - I've had it. - He did nothing but plan this engagement ceremony. - One, two. Wrong foot, left foot. Yeah. - For your centerpieces, I would go with hydrangeas. - Hy-- - Drangea. - He stopped working. He could have done many more deals. He didn't do it. He was very focused on the party. - One step at a time. - So this is the oceanfront deck. It can feel like you're really in the ocean. - That was my one requirement. Now if she's happy, I'm happy. I've definitely taken the wheel in planning. I'm creating this as a reflection of myself and my capabilities. - Pffft. - We should do as much light as possible all over here. - They're not best friends. - This is one of the first events that you're doing? - So this is just for the engagement party. - Okay. Did you want the groom's name? - Sure. I was gonna do my dog's name. - That's fine too. - Cheeni. C-H-E-E-N-I. - Okay. - Cheeni Malai Sadana. I'm mama. This is boyfriend. - I'm Cheeni's boyfriend. She does order me around like, "Get the ball for me, boyfriend." Barks at me to play. So yeah, I guess, she's a strong woman too. - Hi, Rich. - Hello. - You're so pretty. - Are you excited for the engagement party? - No. - No? - What excited? I'm not gonna get drunk like your friends are. - His whole family's here. Whoever from our side is here. So I'm just asking if you're excited. - What is that supposed to mean? I'm not a child. - There's still ups and downs there. I don't want that friction anymore. But at the same time, when I'm here, I don't want them to treat me like a piece of crap. What is Vishal doing today? - Finishing up everything. He put in a lot of effort. He did most of the planning. Almost all of it. What's that face for? - You should be nervous about it. You should be--you're getting into a new life, I'm not. - You're the one that said engagement parties are when the families join together, no? - We'll see what happens. - I'm very happy--Vishal asked me to be part of the dance. And what a chance for Monica to shine, you know? Is this where we're going? - Hey. - Hey. How are you? - Thanks for organizing this. - Of course. - Hey. - Hi. - No. The last time we spoke, you said you didn't like me. - I kind of don't like you. Like I kind of-- - Okay, good to know. But I'm going to be a team player. Vishal is getting engaged, and I just want to be there for him. - What up, guys? - Brought wine. - I brought whisky. - Vishal brought whisky. - Wait, wait, wait. No, no, no. Practice, practice. - Seven drinks later and I'll be ready. - We're all like sloshed. - That's the least of my concerns. - You said it's the least of your worries. What are the most of the worries? - Yeah, what's going on right now, 'cause, you know, Indian weddings come with a lot of drama. - It's not a wedding. It's my engagement party. - Do we have to do a different dance for your wedding? - Like, three dances at my wedding. During a wedding or an engagement ceremony, the girl's side and the boy's the side, they always do dances. And it's just a way of showing love and appreciation. Initially, Monica's gonna teach me a solo dance. - You're gonna do a solo dance? - Get her turned on. Maybe make it a little excited for what's gonna happen afterwards. Besides being a stripper/pole dancer... - Look at the form. - Oh, my God. - I can pull off some other dance moves. - Okay, ready? - Let's go, from the top. - One, two. One, two. One, two. And one, two, three. Vishal. - Yeah, I got it. - One, two, three. All right, ready? Fingers together. And one, two, one, two. Now one, two. One, two. One, two. One, two. And jump. And one, two, three, four. - One, two, one... - Forget it. - Left first. - Guys, you got to make me look good in front of my future family-in-laws. - Yeah. - Family. - My future family. - Your fam. - You're supposed to refer to Richa's mom as Mom from now on. - Mom. - Mom. - Do you want all your fingers? - I just want simple, like, laced-looking fingers. Like, if I can do too much here, then I won't be able to function, so-- - Remember when Vishal asked you if he could get engaged? I think he pooped his pants like 10 times. He told me that after. I didn't know that he was asking you that day. - He was nervous-- I could see he was, like, little stammering. - I wanted to ask for your blessings that we can have the engagement ceremony. - Right. - Is that a yes? - He's like, "I literally cannot breathe without her." - All right, let's chill. - Wine break. - So... nervous, excited? - Honestly, dude. I've been stressed out of my mind like the past month trying to arrange like every little thing to prove to Richa, to prove to her mom-- - But more so Mom-in-law. - More so Mom-in-law. - 'Cause you've already got Richa on your hands. - I haven't got Richa on my hands. I'm surprised, honestly, like, she's with me. - As a parent, I need to know how much he makes or how is he gonna keep you and all that stuff. I still do not know the answers. Reshma does not even like my asking how much he makes. Guess what her answer was. "Oh, even I don't know what he makes." She writes the check for him because he works for her. And she tells me, "I don't know what he makes. I never bothered to ask." So that's a big lie. - Don't completely put yourself down like that. - No, but she has like her sh-- together, And I'm like--I'm a **** up. - You're not a **** up. - I see what my fundamental problem with Lopa Auntie is. I just need to have confidence in myself. - Let your balls drop and become a man. - What? So I'm gonna show her, listen, "Lopa Auntie, here are my balls." - Metaphorically. - Let's just say, hypothetically, he wants to be a house husband, then what? That would bother you. - Yeah. As a parent point of view-- - And Daddy was technically a house husband. - No, he wasn't. - He was a professor, but he still took care of the house. - He wrote so many books. And he was a doctor. - He was simple, docile type of person. I always like strong men. Any time he saw me making more money, he was like, "Whatever." Some men cannot take it and some men can take it. Some men love it, women making more so they don't have to worry and they-- they can go enjoy it. - Vishal, he would love for me to be like the top of what I do. In that sense-- - He gets to travel with you. He's gets to go everywhere with you. - But he's one of those, like in his mind he's like, "I get the perks of it, so why wouldn't I want her to be--" - Yeah. So he gets to go free travel with her. - I mean, but it works in our relationship. I'm not saying that that would work in everyone's relationship. - I'm not gonna say anything. Happiness is important. But that's not everything. After five years, those things wither away too. - We've been dating for seven years. - Okay. - We've been through plenty of ups and down. - Okay. - So you can ignore all the questions that you don't have unanswered and actually just enjoy. It's the Punjabi blood in us. - Feisty blood. - Let me know what I can do, and we'll make it happen. You'll make it happen. - Maybe you can make out with Lopa Auntie. - Whoever you need me to make out with. You need me to make out with Lopa Auntie, I will make out with Richa's mom. - Do me a solid, bro. - Done. Done. - Coming up.... - Want to double date? - Yeah, let's do it. I'm gonna set you up if you're gonna set me up. - While I'm alive, I want to see how much our child loves her. - Yesterday. Hi, Hector. I gave up everything for this business to succeed, but it hasn't happened. I want to see our new fabrics. You know how much this is? - It's expensive. - I'm going to be 35 this year. Like, I should be living on a yacht. Possibly with a husband and the one daughter I'd like to have. So what the **** am I doing? - I have no idea. I don't know where my life is headed. - Hope they have a sale going on. - Mm-hmm. - Hi, welcome. - Hi. - You need help today? - Yes. - Yeah, going to an engagement party. - Not too bling-bling. But something nice. - Okay. - I want something bling-bling. - I like this. - I love this. What's that silver one? It's the same one in silver. We can be twins. - I like this. - I do tag along with my mom everywhere she goes. Mom, this has high potential for camel toe. - Yeah, I--you actually look good, Mom. But it has camel toe potential. Actually, buying things is a luxury right now. - My mom. - Oh, dear. See, Anish. - Oh, I like it on you. - I love the skirt on you. - Totally pretty, right? All right. Mom, there's a few things I wanted to talk about. And I do have a confession to make. Kind of embarrassing. It's been like a month, but it's weighing on me that I kind of lied to my dad. - How do you plan to get this funding? - Well, I have most of it. I got mad at Monica for being fake. Yet here I am behaving like a hypocrite, you know? I want to get this off my chest. - I'm getting a little nervous. What did you do? - I had a meeting with Dad about my business. And I kind of exaggerated a little how much I actually have. - A little? - I told him I had close to like $1/2 million. - Why do you have to say such dumb sh--? - It meant a lot when he told me he was proud of me. - Your dad is proud of you irrespective of the-- - I know. - And we are there to help you. - I'm not even paying rent. - No, no, no, no. I can never dream of taking rent from any of-- - I know. - Because I still live in the hope that whenever y'all have your spouses or, you know, children, that room is there for you to use. - There's something else that's also been weighing heavily on me. And that's, you know... the topic of freezing my eggs. - No, I'm gonna put my bag there and talk to you about this. - Okay. - This is coming from a good place. But I would say to you just have the child in the natural way and have fun. - With who, Mom? And when and where? - You know with whom I will say. So I'm not going into that subject. - Yeah. I don't want a child right now. - I never thought in my wildest dream she'll say she'll freeze her eggs because I was so sure that she would get back with Vishnu and kind of have a perfect life. We cannot push you to the altar. But my mother helped me so much when I had children, I want to do the same for you. But because I'm getting older, I don't know if I'll be able to do that. And that bothers me. - While I'm alive, I want to see how much our child loves her. She'll be a great mom. - It's just depressing. - I know life is somewhat easier right now because I do have my parents and I do have my grandparents. But when I think of them not being there, I can't imagine-- - Because I tell her, my father, he says the only thing I'm living right now is to see Anisha married. - I really don't want to cry anymore 'cause I know how you feel and I know everyone in the community asks you. - The only reason is it comes from a good place, and I care for you. - I know. I don't know what I'm gonna do, whether I'm even gonna freeze my eggs for sure. But I don't want to miss the boat on that experience. - Yeah. If that's what you want to do, I respect your decision in that. I'm so sorry I upset you or anything. Can I give you a hug, darling? - Sure, Mom. - I didn't mean to hurt you. - I love you. - I'm so sorry. I'm really sorry. And I think with the age and menopause, the tear, all the waterworks are turning on faster. - Oh, this is the spot. - What can I order? - I'll go with my mango. - The reg? - You get something different so I get to try it. We try each other's. - But what if I don't like mine then I'm having yours. Deal? Brian and I have been through so much the last few months. - La-da-da-da. - You want a drink of that water. Like as far as friends, that's where your head's at? - Yeah. Where's your head at? - I think a little more. So are you saying there's no shot? - I feel bad that I don't feel the same way that you feel. I don't think he's my forever person. But I'm so happy that whatever was thrown our way-- - Monica will be in Brian's room. - Oh, sh--! - Oh! - We're like this. Like, we're not gonna be shaken. - Oh, that's money. - Uh-uh. - What? - This is strong. - Oh, yeah. Whose is whose? - Are you excited for the engagement party? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I mean-- - They make such a cute couple. - Yeah. I think they're beautiful together. So how are things going with you and Anisha? - Girls, one, two. - Yeah. - No, no, no. After. Back two, back two. You know, I taught Anisha the dance for the party. So of course, I've had interactions with her. But I'm not gonna force anything, you know? I don't got time for that. - Yeah, on top of work and everything else, your dance classes and all that. - I'm 27 years old. Like-- - We're getting there you know? - Dude, I'm pushing 30. Like, when did we get here? - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Take it easy. No one's pushing 30. - I'm really trying to hit certain goals for myself. I want the big house. And hopefully, one day, I'll start a dance studio of my own. - Why are you pausing on that? - If I could-- - You want me to move out? - No. I don't want you to move out. Just stay, just stay. I'll take care of the kids. - I'm glad that things are moving along in the right path. Enjoy life. - I'm glad that you're kind of dating other girls. - So what are you looking for? - Just looking to hang out with like a pretty girl. - I think you're so cool. Like a terrific wonderful guy. And I'm totally looking for more friends. - Yeah, same, same. But, um... but yeah. You know, I'm still hesitant to certain, you know-- - Just don't go into like nitpicking. - You want to double date? - Yeah, let's do it. I'm gonna set you up if you're gonna set me up. - What do you think is perfect for me? - Someone Indian. - Fact. - You need somebody really pretty, otherwise you're super uninterested. You're really shallow. - False. - Fact. - I'm still gunning for an Indian girl. But you control your own destiny. - That's right. - Right-o, right-o, right-o. - You control your fate. - Exactly. - You can't--you know? - You don't let it come at you. - One more time. - You go after it. - Two times. Both at the same time. No, same time. - Same time, one, two, three. - One, two-- - What's--what's your-- - Who's my setup? - Yeah. - Want me to go down the checklist? - Yeah, let's go down the checklist. - Stable, successful. - Okay. - Someone that can support and be there you. - I can support myself. - Of course. But you don't have to work. You don't like working. No one likes working. - I like-- - Own your own biz kind of thing. - Okay. - I'm just throwing it out there, right? - Uh-huh. - Possibilities. And then someone that gets you. - The type of guy that I would like Monica to be with, someone who's got his act together. - What if like you just answered that question and you're like, "He rides in on a Harley"? - No, you're not gonna go for that anyway. You're a Bentley type of-- - Oh, my--no I'm not. - You like nice things. - Why? Why do you--no, I don't. - Monica, you like nice things. - And you're gonna set me up. - All right, done. - See, if you get a little jealous, give me the side-eye. I don't want to hear it. - Okay, done. - I gave you the first shot. - Coming up... - Thank you very much on behalf of my wife and myself. This is a very special occasion. Thank you very much-- - Lopa. - Lopa. - There's just certain things - There's just certain things that she's very strict on. - Curfews, tattoos, belly button piercings. - I'm panicked about the partying, and I'm panicked about like the no sense of, like, I've got a curfew and any of that. Yeah, I'm nervous. - Look at that. Oh, my God. - Hey, Bal. - Hey, Mommy. - Dad and I are going out for dinner. Where are you going all dressed up? - Well, I wanted to talk to you about something. - Oh, God, what? - You know how Anushka has been wanting to get a tattoo? - She had mentioned it once. I had suggested not to. - Right. - Okay. I'm taking her for one now. - Oh, God--how big? - Very small, Mom. Her and I are just getting little ones on our pinkies. Anushka has wanted matching tattoos with me ever since I can remember. Anushka doesn't even know that we're doing this today. - Right. She's been asking for it. - And I want to do something fun with her for a change. - Yeah. - Like, I'm always the-- - So just do that. - You want to do one too? - No. - On your boob, like that? That's where we're gonna get it, Mom. All right, we're doing it. I'm extremely strict. But she really wants it. And she's almost turning 18. And so if it's special to her, I'll draw blood. - Drive safe. - Ow! - What happened? - The seat is very low. Your boyfriend is very tall? - Where are we going? - I'll give you the address. Slowly. You're reversing very fast. I don't-- - We're going 3 miles per hour. - I look like a hag. I want to look very youthful and radiant at the engagement party on Saturday. - I'm gonna wear the butterfly sari. I don't know how many years I have left in me where I can wear a blouse like that. You know what I mean? - That's how I feel about the belly button piercing. - Why does it always come back to that? So where is everybody going? What is everybody deciding? - For school? - Hmm. - Decisions don't come out till the end of this month. - Where do you think that you are geared to? Maybe even University of Louisville? - I would like to go to Northeastern. - That makes me sad, Nush. Ask O'Malley. - Are you serious? - Yeah, I get really sad and I cry about it. It's very bittersweet for me because her going to college means I start a new chapter with O'Malley that I'm really looking forward to too. - I'm gonna miss home. - Your grandparents will be here, our home will be here. - Yeah, but still. It won't be like, "Okay, I'm gonna go visit like Mom at home." - That's my only concern about moving to Louisville. It's gonna be hard. - Why are we here? - So we're here to get tattoos. - You're kidding. - No. Do you really want to do it? - Yeah. This is so crazy. - I have an appointment. Bali. - Is it for both of you guys? - Like what we want is just like a little A and a little B. You have finger tattoos too? - Yes. - Where is the least painful? Do you have any input on wrist? - Yeah, no, I'm not doing wrist. - I don't want it there. - I want to do it like on that left side of my body 'cause that's where my heart is. So I'll do it--I don't mind doing it here. - Do you want to just like hold off till we research and like get a better location? - Come over here and sit down and talk to me about what's going on in your head. Why are you saying no right now? Because of the pinky situation or because you don't want a tattoo right now? - I'm scared. Sorry, Mom. - Why are you sorry, baby? You don't have to apologize to me. - 'Cause you were like surprising me and stuff. - It's okay. I love you. If I'm gonna be completely honest here, I wish I had a remote control that would hit rewind. It's going to be very hard for me to get used to living without her. - We can text every day. - Text? - Yeah, we text every day at home. - Right. But we're gonna talk. - Yeah. - I want to hear your voice every day. - Okay. - "Text"? - It's go time. This engagement ceremony has cost $40,000. But of course, it's raining. Outfits, here, okay. Mm... - Hey, Julie. - How are you? - Oh, stressing. - Don't worry about it. I heard you were out partying last night. - Yeah. A long night. - Yeah. - Last night, me and my family threw a dinner because we have so much family flying into town. - I don't remember 'cause I was drunk. - Thank you very much on behalf of my wife and myself. This is a very special occasion for us. Thank you very much... - Lopa. - Lopa, to being part of our family. - It was supposed to be, like, sunny and warm. - Yeah. - And we were gonna have it on the rooftop, and now it's gonna be rainy and cold. - And it's never like this in South Florida. It might snow later. - It's Miami. What the hell!? I'm no longer gonna be able to have it on the rooftop. I had to get heaters last-minute, and that's another, like, $2,000. And a tent, which is $6,000. The bills just keep adding up. - Thank you. I wish we got nicer weather. But at least I got you, right? - Vishal, he's thinking in his mind that he's trying to impress me. But it's funny that weather not cooperating. - I like that you think that that's funny that our whole plans have gotten changed. - No, but I mean-- - I don't find it-- - I wanted your wish to come true. - But you're laughing that yours came true. So then? - I didn't mean to. - Perfect. And you can check on them, how the tables are set up and just make sure it's the right way, okay? I am extremely nervous of what I have to do. - All right, so what do we have to do? - Okay. - How long do we have to do it? - I need everything to go smoothly. I want everything done in an hour. - An hour? Okay. - Can I pull it off? - You want me to carry you, Vish? - Can you? - Yeah. - Should I practice? I'm Richa right now. Yay! Let's go have sex. We don't have sex 'cause we're Indian. - I'm so excited. Come on, babe. - Take me through the door. - Babe, you put on some weight a little bit at that engagement. Wait, this is what you did in Key West. I'm having like PTSD, 'cause we actually did this-- All right, hold on, hold on. Richa's calling. Be civilized. - Okay. - Hey, babe. - Are you alive? - Yeah. It's coming along well. What are you doing? - I'm getting my makeup done and hair done. Where are you getting ready, in the other room? - Yeah, I'm in the suite. - They're all scattered a little bit. - I know, I keep thinking they're like cats. - I think it's bad luck if I see you before. - Probably. I'll go get it. - I know, but this is the first step to marriage. - Okay. So you're not gonna see me until we get married? That'll be like four years from now. - Love you. You can say I love you too. But she hung up. - How about you and Nicholas? When's that going to happen? - I don't know. I don't know. It's gonna happen for us. - Sh-- or get off the pot, right? - He actually talked to my mom last night at your dinner. - Yeah. Was he like, "Where is the ring?" - No. No, no, no. He hates when my mom introduces him as like a friend. - Please don't say I'm his friend 'cause I'm not his-- - I'm not his friend. - I'm his boyfriend. - No, no. - She just can't say it-- - No, Ma. You say it how you want to say it. - How did you introduce him yesterday? - I just say, "This is my business partner." - So why aren't you saying, "This is my boyfriend. This is fiancé-to-be." - They're gonna put two and two together. I know what I know inside. I don't need to say certain things out loud. Like, "Oh, my boyfriend and I." Yes, yes, we are together and we kiss all the time." Tonight, I'll introduce him as my sexual lover. Is that okay? - You have sex? - Do you have sex? It's not like Richa's your friend. - She's like my friend with benefits. - Ish. - Ish. - Sometimes she's your friend. - Sometimes just my friend. - Sometimes not even your friend. - Sometimes no benefit. - So how do you feel now? - Pretty relaxed now. Vishal was stressed. All he's saying is like, "I hope your mom is happy with me and with the party." - So tell him to respect me. - But he does. - So he's gonna come and touch my feet? - He would. If you told him, he'd pai lagu, he'd do it to you too. - Pai lagu. He's gonna do pai lagu? - He would. - Okay. - Vishal wants her to say like, "Yay. You did good." - I wish I could tell you what would impress my mom. I've been trying to figure that out for years too. I don't think she's asking for the Taj Mahal, but... she wouldn't mind it if she got it I guess. - Yeah. Coming. Hey. - Hey, how is it going? - Hey, babe. - How are you? - Good. You look great. - Oh, my gosh. - Let me see. - Yeah. - Oh, wow, it fits so well. I love the vest. I kind of feel like I'm getting engaged. This is the first time I'm gonna bring Nicholas to this big Indian community engagement party and show the world that this is my partner. Not a girl, it's a guy. And I also want to show him that I'm not ashamed of our relationship. How did you get here? You took an Uber, right? - Yeah. - Okay, good. How are my parents? Are they getting ready? - Yeah. - 'Cause last night, I was actually not expecting you to bring that up last night. I mean, in an ideal world, I wish you would have told me before you talked to her just so I could have mentally prepared that you're gonna have a conversation with her and-- - Yeah, yeah. - She did feel blindsided, especially at like Vishal's house. You know, maybe that would have been better to like bring up at home. - Yeah. Okay. Meaning like maybe she should have asked me what she would like to introduce me as prior to the engagement? - It's--it's a sensitive topic. - Okay. I knew I was gay when I was four. And I'm 35. And to hear somebody say, "I'm just going to introduce you as his friend and just--" it was not okay. - You and I, we are accustomed to this gay life 'cause this is all we see now, right? - Yeah. - But for my mom to see two men kissing, even though on the outside, she's like, "I love my son. I'll support him forever," and I truly think she believes that... - Yeah. - I'm sure she kind of--she still like shudders inside. - I mean, I already know my own parents have a really difficult time in accepting it. My parents are evangelical Christians with a very literal interpretation of the Bible. They are never rude. They are never demeaning. But there are limits. There are just limits. And I mean, at a certain point, I want to get married and I want to have kids with you. And I think it just makes me put my guard up. It's not like I carry malice with me in my heart towards your parents. - Yeah. - They've always been wonderful to me. - Yeah. Just be patient with them. It's hard for them. They did not see him living this life. - Coming up... - Make some noise for Vishal and Richa. - Whoo! - Richa, are you ready? - Almost. - Richa. You look very good. - Thank you. - Look at you. - Thank you. I need to go and sort of freshen up. - It's like a stress going down? - Yeah. - Go... - I'm like tired. You look good. - She's gorgeous. But when is she not? I'm happy that I found a girl that's like the perfect combination like of inner beauty and outer beauty and just the right amount of naive to be with me. - We're late, we're late. - We're late. - We're 40 minutes late. - They've been engaged for a while now. And the fact that we're actually attending an engagement party is pretty incredible. - I thought it would be a wedding. But it's one step closer, I would say, the engagement party. - Yeah, we're a step closer now. - Yes. - Good. - Namaskar. - I will admit, there are very few Hindi words or Sindhi words that I do understand. And I guarantee you, they're not using words like fart, come, calm down. - Come? - Come, like come here. - Oh! - The bar's open. Oh, my God. - How are you? - You're looking very good. - I need a drink, bro. What are you having? - Typical. I'm stoked for Vishal for pulling this off. - Absolutely. - Planning for next year, Brian's engagement. - Whoop-whoop. I'll do a bourbon and ginger ale. - Honestly-- - You know what, the one thing I'll say is it will be a hell of a party 'cause I have way too many family and friends. And like, we all actually get along. - We're ready. We're ready. - All right, here we go. Done, done. - All right. Ladies and gentlemen, your attention please. Make some noise for Vishal and Richa. - Go, Richa! - I am impressed by the party. If someone had told him we could have elephants, he probably would want to elephants there too. It's ridiculous. - Yeah, I did good. - Shoes off, right? - Yeah. - Can you help me take my shoes off if you don't mind? - Hello. - Hi. - Please kindly stand up. - Stand up? - Yes. And wash your hands. - The engagement ceremony is basically our two families coming together, and we're doing a puja. - It's a group of prayers to please remove all the obstacle and make more smooth their life together. - All together, hold your hands. Yeah, say with me om. - Om! - The girl's parents, they bless the boy first and then bring the bring the fruits basket and the sweets, and we call it shagun. - No one pays attention. First of all, it's incredibly long, so you kind of-- - No, don't. You're not supposed to say-- - Nobody has an attention span. Well, they are long. - You're not supposed to say that. One more time. Now you can exchange your plates. - My parents and Richa's mom are exchanging gifts. It's a big deal. It's just the joining of two families. - Come on. - I put it on myself? - Put it on myself? - Ehh. Ehh! Ehh! Got to make you work a little bit. Got to make you work a little bit. No, no, no! - She's like, "No!" - Oh, he got her a ring. - Yeah! Yeah. - Whoo! - Her saying that she loves me means the world to me. She's probably said "I love you" like four times prior to today. - It's never now and then. It's only special occasions, like every two years. - Babe, should we just quickly do an engagement ceremony real quick? One more. - Hey. - Hey. - Can I have you for a minute? - Of course. - Okay. I wanted to clear the air after last night. I walked away from our conversation at the sofa at the Parvanis' house. - Which conversation was this? - Where you asked me, "Nicholas, how should I introduce you?" When I said I didn't want you to introduce me as Amrit's friend. - Oh. - I walked away, and I went to bed. I didn't feel good. There's negative messages that that brings to the table. - I didn't know you were upset at me. - It's just--it's a source of anxiety for me. - I just feel like how I do I introduce you to everybody right now? - Yeah. - I have to say you're Amrit's friend. I cannot like say this is Amrit, my gay son, and that's his partner. - Yeah. - My mom, she's still coming to terms. She's moved maybe 70% of the way. But there's still the 30%. There's still that a little bit of a hang up. - It's hard for me to go out and introduce you as-- - They're hard words to say. They are. - Because for me, I've just accepted Amrit as it is. - Yeah. - As parents, when you have a gay child, it's more than accepting it for yourself and for your child, it is more for the community. How do I tell people? What will they think? What will they say? But when you get past all of that, beyond all of that, it really doesn't matter. Now I come out and tell everybody, you know what, my son is gay, and I'm proud about him. - I wish I can hear that from my mom. - One day, you will. - Yeah. - I promise you, she will come about. - Yeah. - You and Uncle Suresh have always been utterly wonderful to me. I mean, you've opened your hearts to me. You've opened your home to me. You've exposed me to your whole family. I just know that my mom, this was not what she expected. - Should never worry about it. You know you'll always have a mom... - Yes. - And you'll always have a dad in us. - Thank you. - We do love Nicholas. Maybe I was a little inhibited about how do I introduce him, but I didn't mean anything badly. - I do consider him as part of my family. My third ace in the hole. In India, we consider a son as an ace. So we have three now, full flush. - Aw. - Aw. - Did you meet my son? - Yes, I did meet him. - Coming up... - I really love Richa. I want you to see that I would do anything for her. - Wait, what's in your box? - Oh, these are yummy. - Oh, they're like nature bars, right? - What are they called? - Nature bars. Like when you go on hikes. - Yup, uh-huh, at a Sindhi engagement. - Try it. It's yummy. Yummy. It's like nuts. - I don't know about the Indian culture, but I can tell you, O'Malley definitely doesn't fit into the Indian clothes. - He has to have his Indian outfits custom-made because Indians just don't make sizes like that. - They didn't believe me when I sent his measurements to India. They're like, "What have you done? This is not right." The other day, Anushka told me that she's scared to leave. - Of course. - Now that she's scared, it makes me sad for her. It would suck saying bye, knowing she's excited. But to know that she's gonna be in pain-- I just want Anushka to be okay. - I love you. - Like that first month when she's gone and she wants to come home 'cause she's homesick. - Right. - I want her to like know home is home. - Right. - What if I postponed for like a month or two? I also don't want to move to Louisville when I'm like sobbing about her. - Baby, our plan has always been, when you're ready to move, move. The time period doesn't affect how much I love you. It'll take however long it takes. When it's right, it's right. And that's when you'll move to Louisville. - And you're okay with that? - I love you more than I've ever loved you. - Do you like the party? - More than I've ever had. It's great. - I know. I can't wait for Monica and Brian get engaged. So cute. Let's go. - Two, two, two, two, ha! Ready? - No, no, no. I didn't know you could kick. - Why didn't I do this earlier? - Are you gonna jump with it? Are you gonna jump with it? - At this point in time right now, do I see it? No. She's on her ship. I'm on my ship. If our ships intersect in some way in the future, you know, I can't predict the future. This time, she'd have to come to me though. I'm not going to her. That's for sure. - My God. Your earrings are so pretty. - Thank you. They're from my father. They're from the man who buys me diamonds, my father. - How's the collection going? Were you-- - I'll have coke and whisky. I can't even move forward in my life right now emotionally. And I have so much going on. - party. What are we drinking, shots? - What's next for me? I'm really excited And hopefully, I can move out and begin my new chapter and find a boyfriend, yeah. - Oh, hi, Vishal. - Auntie! How are you? - Everything good, man. Everything turning out good though, isn't it? - How are you enjoying the night? - Pretty good, it was fun. It was fun. - I wanted to say thank you. Like, having Richa, you, my mom, and me, and my dad all together, it made me emotional. And I really, really love Richa. And I want you to see that I will do anything for her. - I know that. I want her to be happy because she's my--my youngest baby. - But after today, how do you feel like everything is-- - Everything is moving on pretty good. - I want us to be like one big family. And like after the engagement ceremony, when we were passing the gifts to each other, I got teary-eyed. - I'm tearing now. - I want you to be happy. - You too. - I really--I felt amazing. And... Richa's mom likes me. - Cheers to our good future. - The best part of it all, I'm engaged. - Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for all of Vishal's friends. That's right, put your hands together, ladies and gentlemen, come on. Put your hands together. Come on. - I dropped my balls. I let them hang loose. Like, this could not be going any better. Yeah! - Well done. - I'm really, really happy how everything went today. I'm really, really grateful for this union. - Everything is great. I think it went pretty well. - It went very well. I think it went well. It was well, extremely well. I am extremely proud of him. - Thank you guys for everything. You guys totally didn't hesitate for a minute when we decided that we were doing the party. We love you both. Thank you so much. - We love you. - Yeah. - And we love you. - You want to? - Yeah. - Okay, he wants to give Vishal a kiss. You got lipstick. - You don't get mine. - Yeah, thank you. - Thank you. - For more information on "Family Karma," Surf the internet with browser of future osdb.link/brave
