Did You Or Didn't You, Huh? Hello. Yeah. Just A Minute. Jerry, It's For You. Yeah, Ok. All Right. I'll Keep You Honest. Good. Two Pair-- 8S And 8S. Whoo! Poor Guy! I Pulled A Third Jack. Yeah, This Is Walsh. I Bet You He Had 'Em Going In. Is That Right, Dan? Draw To 4 Of A Kind? Dan Wouldn't Pull A Dirty Trick Like That On An Old Friend, Would You? Hey, You Bet Your Life I Would. The Name Of The Game Is Win, Am I Right? Yeah, Sure I Won, But Not Tonight. Look, I Put In My 8 Hours Today. That's All I Get Paid For, Right? If He's In Town, I'll Pick Him Up Tomorrow. Next Week. Whenever. Look, I'm Not Going To Spend The Entire Night In Some Armpit Bar Waiting For This Geek To Show Up, Not On The Word Of A Coked-Up Snitch. Look, I'll Talk To You Tomorrow, Ok? All Right. What Was That About? That Was The Watch Commander Of The P.V. Search Unit. They Got A Tip That Sonny Dupree Is Back In Town. He's Going To Show Up At Some Bar Later Tonight, A Place Called Big Ed's On Sebaco Street. They Expect Me To Go Down There And Pick Him Up. Sonny Dupree's Back In Town? Katy, Bar The Door! Ha Ha Ha! Who's Sonny Dupree? Well, He's One Of Jerry's Favorite Boys. What...You're Gonna Adopt Him, Aren't You, Jer? He's A Rapist. He Was Convicted Of A Rape-Murder Of A Coed At U.S.C. A Few Years Back. Isn't That Right, Jerry? Ucla. The Supreme Court Overturned The Conviction. He's Been Up Twice For Rape Since. They Kicked Him Loose On Parole Both Times. So What Else Is New? Weiker, Deal The Cards. It's Will's Deal. If This Dude's As Bad As You Say, I Mean, Why Don't You Go Pick Him Up, Keep Him Off The Streets? Oh, You Got To Be Kidding. I Know This Dude. If He Does Show Up At Big Ed's, He's Gonna Be Wired Tight On Cocaine And Booze, And He'll Be Carrying Heat. I Don't Need That. Uh, You Know, This Guy Used To Be The Most Conscientious, The Most Dedicated Parole Officer In The Department. How About That, Huh? I Learned. Don't Be The Best. Be The Oldest.

You Gonna Be There? Ok, Who Should I Ask For? Nina Sloan. Sloan. Got It. Ok. Thank You. Uh-Huh. Bye-Bye. Uh-Uh-Uh-Uh-Uh. My Case. That's The, Uh, The Walsh Case, Right? The Parole Officer That Got Murdered? Mm-Hmm. You Need Any Help With That? Nope, It's Real Open-And-Shut. The Shooter Was A Parole Violator By The Name Of Sonny Dupree Apparently. All I Gotta Do Is Find The Guy. Missing Persons Could Handle It. Oh, Hunter... Uh, About Friday Night... Friday Night. With Me And Jack? And Jack's Sister From Poughkeepsie, New York. Remember? We're On, Right? Well, I Said I'd Think About It, But I Didn't Say I'd Go. Well, What's To Think About? It's Gonna Be Great. All You Gotta Do Is Show Up. It's Not Gonna Cost You A Dime. Jack's Gonna Pick Up The Check. Now, Look, Jack's Sister Is Really Nice. She's Very Pretty. She's Bright. She's A Lot Of Fun . Yeah, So's A Collie. Hunter, Would I Set You Up With A Dog. Come On! Are You Sure You Don't Need Any Help With That Walsh Case? No, I Told You. It's Easy. It's Just Open-And-Shut. All I Gotta Do Is... Find The...Guy. Yeah, I Probably Could Use A Little Help On The Case, Yeah. Come On. Mccall? Uh, About Friday Night. See, I, Uh, I Promised Gordo I Was Going To Help Him Paint His Mom's Apartment. Maybe Another Time, Though, Ok? Hey, Mccall? What Did You Do? Get Turned Down By Every Single Guy In The Precinct? There Are Only 2 Excuses I'll Accept For Being Late For An Appointment. Either You Were In The Hospital In Intensive Care, Or You Were Already Dead. Do You Understand Me, Boy? Yes, Sir, I Do. You Better, Or You'll Find Yourself Back In The Joint. Now Get Out Of Here! Ms. Sloan Is Expecting You. Right Over There. Thanks. Uh-Huh. He Keeps Doin' That, He's Not Gonna Get Out Of Here With Half His Pension Funded. Well, It's Got To Be A Miserable Job Working With People Like That Every Day. Hunter: Hi, Ms. Sloan? I'm Sergeant Rick Hunter. This Is My Partner Dee Dee Mccall. Sloan: How Do You Do? Hi. Mr. Colson Said You'd Be Stopping By Today. Yeah, For The File On James Dupree. Uh, Did You Get It? Oh, Yes, It's Someplace Here In This Mess. I Started Work On Monday, And They've Dumped Mr. Walsh's Entire Caseload Onto Me As You Can See. Oh, Here. Here It Is. Um...I Don't Know If I Really Should Let You Have This. Parolee Files Are Confidential, You Know, And... They're Only Available To The Parole Department... Give It To Them, Sloan. They're On Our Side. Mr. Donaldson-- Donaldson: My Responsibility, Sloan. Donaldson: I'm Sorry About That. These Kids Come In Here, Fresh Out Of College. Is This All You Got On This Sonny Dupree Character, Is A--A Rundown Of His Arrests And Convictions? And His Parole Record. And If He Reported Regularly And On Time, His Job Record's Like That. We've Got So Many Cases That If We Kept A Full Jacket On Each Parolee, We Wouldn't Have Room For Anything Else. Not A Very Solid Citizen, Is He? If The System Was Running The Way It Should, They'd Have Given Him The Gas Chamber The First Time. Jerry Walsh Was A Real Good Man. So If You Don't Bring Dupree Back Alive, Nobody's Gonna Say Boo. Well, Are You Sure Sonny Did This? Oh, I Know Jerry Was After Him For A Couple Of Months To Throw His Butt Back In Prison For Parole Violation. Got A Tip Last Night He Was Back In Town. He Went Out After Him. You Know What's Weird About This? When Jerry Got The Phone Call, He Said He Wasn't Going To Go After Dupree. Uh, It's Too Dangerous. Dan Kidded Him About It, Remember? So? He Changed His Mind. You Sure About That? Look. He Was Killed Not 2 Blocks From Big Ed's Bar, Which Is Where Dupree Was Last Night. And He Was After Dupree For A Couple Of Months. I Mean, He Had A Real Burn On Putting Sonny Back In The Slammer. He Talked About It All The Time. I Mean, Dupree Isn't Exactly What You'd Call One Of Nature's Noblemen, But, Uh, Jerry's Dealt With Worse. We All Have. But If It Was, Uh, Dan, Then I Could Understand It. Hunter: Dan? Colson. He's A Real Hard Case. Yeah, Where Is Colson? I Called Him. He Said He Was Gonna Be Here. He Went Out A Little While Ago. I Think He Went After Sonny Himself, And I'll Tell You Something. If He Finds Him, They're Gonna Need To Pick Up What's Left Of Him With A Blotter. ♪ Standin' Between These 4 Walls ♪ ♪ Mutiny Surrounds Me ♪ ♪ Witnessing Rat Pack ♪ ♪ And Violence Is Our Enemy ♪ ♪ What Happened To My Human Rights? ♪ ♪ Keep Me At Arm's Length... ♪ Garbage Collector!

Now Just Take It Easy And Drop The Gun Right Back On The Bed. Now Clasp Your Hands Behind Your Head. Atta Boy. What's Going On Here? Who Are You People? Don't Worry About It, Mrs. Dupree. We're The Police. Hey, If You're The Cops, We're On The Same Side. Hey, Put 'Em Back Up. Wait A Minute Now. I'm A Parole Officer. I'm Dan Colson. My Creds Are In My-- In My Right Hand Pocket Of My Jacket. Mrs. Dupree: He Broke In Here. He Didn't Ring Or Anything. He Just Smashed In The Door. You Saw What He Did. Well, Don't Worry. He's Not Going To Hurt Either You Or Your Child. What's The Idea Of Treating These People Like This, Colson? Who The Hell Do You Think You Are? Her Husband Killed A Parole Officer, My Buddy For 20 Years, And She's Harboring Him. Dupree Is Only A Suspect Right Now, Colson. Now, You May Have Probable Cause To Come In Here, But Not To Terrorize These People And Bust This Place Up. He's A Parole Violator. Now, I Have The Right To Bust In Any Place I Want Where I Think He's Hiding. Sonny Didn't Violate His Parole. He's Got A Regular Job. He's Leading A Straight Life. Sure. Can I Take My Hands Down Now? That Still Doesn't Give You Any Right To Terrorize A Woman And A Child, Colson. Listen, Before You Two Start Shedding Tears For These People, You Ask Yourself How Many Cops Are Dead Because Some Parole Officer Was Too Soft On Guys Like Sonny... And His Family. Hey, Colson. More Cops Get Hurt Because Jerks Like You Butt Into Their Business. So Why Don't You Butt Out? [Door Slams] Mrs. Dupree: That Terrible Man. I Mean, Breaking Into My House And Terrorizing Us Like That? Why Didn't You Arrest Him? Well, I Know It Isn't Much Of A Consolation, But, Uh... The Law Gives Him That Right. Look, I Know Sonny Broke The Law, And He Has To Pay For That. But He Never Meant To Hurt Anybody. And To Put Him Under The Thumb Of A Man Who's A Worse Criminal Than He Ever Was-- Mrs. Dupree, Do You Know That Your Husband Hasn't Checked In With His Parole Officer In The Last 5 Or 6 Weeks? That's Not True. Sonny Goes Every Wednesday Morning At 10:00 Like Clockwork. Ask Mr. Walsh, His Parole Officer. Well, I'm Afraid We Won't Be Able To Do That. You See, Jerry Walsh Was Murdered Last Night. Ohh...God... Mrs. Dupree, Where Was Sonny Last Night? He Was Home. If He Wasn't At Home And You're Lying, Don't. You'll Only Make It Worse For Both Of You. Minutes Before Jerry Was Murdered Last Night, Your Husband Was Seen Leaving A Bar Just 2 Blocks Away. Sonny Didn't Do It! He Couldn't. He's Not A Killer. Well, He Did Kill A Girl, And He Did Go To Jail For It. He Was Drunk, And He Ran Her Down, And She Died. Look... I'm Grateful To You For Stopping That Man. But I Don't Have Anything More To Say To You. So Please Go. Please.

Well, If It Isn't Sergeant Hearts And Sergeant Flowers, The Miranda Twins. You Read Any Good Rights Lately? Heh Heh Heh. Hey, Colson. What The Hell You Doing Around Here? My Job, Hunter. Oh, Come On. The County Doesn't Pay You To Beat Up On People Who Can't Fight Back. They're Garbage. I'm Trying To Keep The Streets Clean. Give Me A Break, Huh? Let Me Tell You Something Once, And Once And For All. This Is Now A Homicide Investigation. That Makes It My Turf. You Stay Off Of It. Hey, I've Got Jurisdiction Here, As Much As Anybody. That Scum Killed My Buddy. Now, You Stay Off Me, Or I'm Gonna Run You Over. Hey, Sammy, Let Me Talk To You For A Minute, Huh? Ohh. First Colson And Now You. My Day Is Made. Hey, Look, Man, If You Know Where Sonny Is And You're Covering For Him, You Could Be Up For Obstruction Of Justice. Justice? Guy's On Parole, He's A Punching Bag For Anybody With A Badge To Work Out On. And You Wonder Why Cops Get Killed. Are You Saying He Offed His Parole Officer Because He Got Punched Out? Don't Put Words In My Mouth. I Didn't Talk To Colson, And I Ain't Talkin' To You, So Bug Off, Lady, Huh? You Gotta Be Kiddin'. Jerry Walsh Was Like A Father To Sonny. I Mean It. They Were Like--Like Father And Son. Ahh, Sonny Couldn't Have Killed Him. Sonny Couldn't Have Killed Anybody. Yeah, But His First Conviction Was For Killing That Girl. All Right, He Killed A Girl. He Was Drunk Out Of His Mind, And He Didn't See Her In A Crosswalk And-- Oh, Come On. I Saw Walsh's File On The Guy. He Had Him Down As A 3-Time Convicted Rapist, And One Of The Rapes Included Murder. That's Crazy, Hunter. Jerry's The Guy That Brought Sonny To Me. He Got Me To Hire Him. He Told Me What He Had Done. He Told Me Where He Was At And Said, "All The Guy Needs Is A Job, And He'll Be Ok." And That's Just The Way It Was. Sonny Never Took A Drink, Never Missed A Day's Work. And As Far As I Know, He Never Missed A Single Day's Reporting To Jerry. Yeah, Well, How Come He's Not Here. Where Is He? I Don't Know. Maybe He's Sick. Look, You Want Someone Maybe Who Could Help You? You Talk To Ramos. Him And Sonny Are Real Tight. You Ask Him. Man: Hey, Lubbock. Come Here. So, How'd You Do With Ramos? Not Even Squat. Think I Should Try It? No, It's A Waste Of Time. You Know What Really Bothers Me? What? We Got 2 Sonnys Here. We've Got A Jekyll And A Hyde. Yeah? Yeah, I Mean, Take A Look At This. The Guys In The Parole Office Turn Us On To A Sonny Who Is A Killer-Rapist. He's Been Nailed 3 Times, Violated His Parole, And Killed His P.O. To Stay Out Of The Slammer, Right? Right. And Then We Talk To His Wife And Sam Lubbock And Ramos, And They Give Us This Sonny Who's A Hardworking, Loving, Devoted Father Whose Only Crime Was Committed While He Was Under The Influence. So, What You're Saying Is You Think That Maybe Walsh Is Trying To Frame Sonny? It's Worth Checking Into. Yeah, Go Ahead. I Want To Stick Around Here And See If Sonny Shows Up. If He Doesn't, I Want To See If Ramos And Sam Lead Me To Him. Ok, I'll Get A Cab. See If You Can Get A Tap Put On Dupree's Phone In Case He Calls His Wife. Yeah. Good Idea. Oh, And, Hunter? Listen, Friday Night... Wear A Tie, Ok? We're Going Someplace Real Nice. Oh, Wait A Minute. How Old Is This Lady? Jack's Sister. How Old Is She? [Car Door Slams] I Just Wanted To Know How Old She Was. I'm Sorry To Have Kept You Waiting For So Long, Sergeant Mccall, But I Had To Run This Through The Computer 3 Times, And It's Still Wrong. What's The Problem? Here. You Can See For Yourself. According To This, Dupree's No Rapist. He's A Drunk Driver. Vehicular Manslaughter? Are You Sure This Is The Right James Dupree? I Checked. He's The Only One The Computer Says Is In The Central Files. "Time Off For Good Behavior. No Parole Violations." Walsh Must Have Known That The Rap Sheet In His File Was A Fake. The Computer's Off. It Has To Be. Here, Let Me Run It Through Again, And I-- N-N-No, That's Ok. It's All Right. Thanks. Excuse Me, Sergeant Mccall. Uh... You Work With Sergeant Hunter All The Time, Right? Yeah, We're Partners. Why? Well, I Was Just Wondering. Um...Are You... Is He Attached? Radio: L-56...Dispatcher. This Is L-56. Go Ahead. I Got A Patch Call From Mccall, Hunter. Hold On A Second. Go Ahead, Mccall. Hunter? Did You Get That Tap Put On Sonny's Phone Yet? Yeah, It Didn't Work. But We'd Better Stop Looking For The Bad Mr. Hyde And Start Looking For The Good Dr.Jekyll. Oh, You Mean He's Not A Rapist And All Those Good Things? He's Clean? Just Like His Wife And Sam Said, He's Only Been Up For Vehicular Manslaughter. Well, Then Why Is The Guy Running? Well, When We Find Him, I'll Ask Him. What Do You Mean, "We"? Where Are You? About A Half A Block In Front Of You. Now, Look, Mom, I Appreciate It, But I Think I Can Handle This Stakeout By Myself. Then You Already Know You've Grown A Tail? Tail? What Do You Mean? Colson. He's A Couple Cars Behind Me. Uh, There Goes My Pigeon Now, Mccall. Do Me A Favor And Get Colson Off My Back, Will You? Hey, Look, Hunter, I'll Take Ramos, And You Follow Colson, Ok? If Any Car's Gonna Get Creamed Here-- Be A Pal, Will You? If I Make A Sharp Right-Hand Turn In This Crate, The Front End's Gonna Fall Off. [Click] [Horn Honking] Hey, Where The Hell Did You Learn To Drive, Woman? Mccall? Why Don't You Get That Piece Of Garbage Off The Street Before You Get A Ticket For Littering, Colson? Hey, I'm Gonna Have You Up On Charges, Do You Hear Me? Do You Hear Me-- I'm Gonna Have You Up On Charges! [Tires Squealing] [Car Door Closes] Move One Muscle, You Won't Have Anything Left To Hang Your Ears On. You Have The Right To Remain Silent, Sonny. You Also Have The Right To Your Choice Of An Attorney. You're A Regular Comedian, Hunter. You're Not Being Very Smart Here, Sonny. You're Adding Kidnapping, Assault, Resisting Arrest To Suspicion Of Murder. You're Digging Yourself A Pretty Big Hole Here. I Didn't Kill Him. You Were Seen Leaving Big Ed's Last Night, Minutes Before Walsh Was Killed. I've Got A Witness To That. Don't Talk To Him, Sonny. He's Only Gonna Twist What You Say All Around And Set You Up! Look, Ramos, Why Don't You Go Outside And Get Some Fresh Air? It'll Clear Your Fat Head. I'll Clear Your Head, Man! I'll Clear It Real Good! Look, I Got Enough Problems Without That. Why Don't You Go Downstairs And, Uh, See If Anyone's Hanging Around? Give Me The Gun. He Tries Something, Sonny... Yeah. I'll Holler. He's Good People--Ramos. He Got A Raw Deal, And He Turned A Little Crazy. Look, Sonny, I Ran A Full Make On You. All I Could Come Up With Is A Flock Of 502S And One Conviction For Vehicular Homicide. Now, Since You've Been Out On Parole, You've Been Clean As Snow. Now, Why Does Walsh Have You Down As A 3-Time Convicted Rapist And A Parole Absconder? It Was A Trap, And I Was The Bait. He Said There Was Some Guy Out There Murdering Parolees, Some Nut Who Thought He Was Protecting The Public From The Rapists And The Murderers That The System Was Putting Back On The Streets. Well, Did He Say Who He Thought It Was? No. He Just Said That, Uh, The Guy Had Already Murdered 6 Parolees And That If He, Uh, You Know, If He Could Set Me Up So He Went After Me, He Could Nail Him. And You Went Along With That? Hey, Jerry Turned My Life Around. If It Wasn't For Him, I'd Be Falling-Down Drunk. I Mean, No Wife, No Kid, No Job, Nothing. I'd Have Done Anything That Man Asked. So What Went Down Last Night, Sonny? Early In The Day, Jerry Called Me And Told Me He Thought The Time Was Right. He Gave Me A Phone Number And Told Me To Call At 10:00 That Night And Ask For Him. He Said Not To Pay Any Attention To What He Said Over The Phone. I Was Just To Go To A Bar He'd Mention In The Conversation, A Place Called Big Ed's, And I Was To Be Sure To Leave It At 1:30 On The Nose And Start Heading East. Jerry Said He'd Be There, I Wasn't To Worry. I Thought The Footsteps I Heard Behind Me Were Jerry's, But I Couldn't Be Sure, And What If It Wasn't? What If He Couldn't Make It For Some Reason? [Can Clanks, Cat Snarls] I Wanted To Yell Out. I Wanted To Jump Up And Grab That Guy By The Throat And Bash His Head Against The Walls, But I Couldn't Move. I Couldn't Breathe. I Was-- Like I Was Frozen There Behind The Garbage Cans. Hunter: Did You See The Guy? Yeah, I Saw Him. Almost As Clear As I See You. Was It Dan Colson? He Was Another Parole Officer That Worked With Walsh. He Was Supposed To Be His Friend. I Don't Know. And, Uh, I Never Saw Him Up There, And Jerry Never Told Me About Him. But If It's The Guy Who Killed Jerry, I Can I.D. Him. Get Me Out Of Here, Sonny. Come On. What, So You Can Take Me In? No Dice. Look, There's A Warrant Out For Your Arrest. I've Got To Take You In. Besides, I Need You To Finger Colson So I Can Nail Him. And Who's Gonna Believe Me? Sorry, Hunter. The Guy Who Killed Jerry, He's Out After Me. I'll Take My Chances. On My Own. Hey, Wait A Minute. You're Not Going To Leave Me In Here Hooked Up Like This, Are-- Here. I Don't Need It. That'll Hold You. I Don't Need This. Sorry, Hunter. Hey... Sonny! [Door Closes] Radio: L-56, Come In, Please. L-56, Come In. L-56, Come In. [Trying Door Handle] L-56, Come In. This Is L-56. Over. Stand By For Sergeant Mccall, L-56. Hunter? Where Have You Been? I've Been Trying To Find You For The Last Half Hour. Oh, I've Had A Little Radiator Problem. Then You're Ok? I Didn't Know You Cared. Of Course I Do. Look, I'd Hate To Disappoint Jack's Sister. She's Really Looking Forward To Meeting You. [Click] Hunter? Hunter. I Fold. Me, Too. Natural Flush, All I Get Is The Ante. This Is Lousy, 3-Handed. I Think I'm Going Home. Me, Too. Hi, Fellas. I Just Stopped By. I Thought You Might Need Another Card Partner. It's All Right With Me. Makes For A Better Game Than 3-Handed. Dan? Well, As Long As His Money Is U.S. Of "A." What's The Game? It's Dealer's Choice, Quarter And A Half. New Player Deals. Ok To Check And Raise? Anything Goes, As Long As You Don't Get Caught. How About A Little Pete Loftus Stud? Only Pete Loftus I Know Is A Parolee. Was A Parolee. He's Dead. He Was Murdered About 6 Months Ago. Your Bet. A Kidder. Is That Why They Named The Game After Him, In Memoriam? I Think It Was Pete... Or Dum-Dum Madigan. Or Was It Feets Jackson? Hey, I Don't Get This. All Those Guys Are Parolees. Dead Parolees, Weiker. There Were 12 Of Them. All A Part Of This Tight Little Group Of Yours. All Shot Down In Cold Blood. So, Big Deal. These Guys Are Always Getting Themselves Knocked Off. By Their Parole Officers? Hey, What Kind Of Garbage Are You Dishing Out Here? Well, I'm Just Following Up On What Your Friend Walsh Found Out. I Mean, That Is Why You Killed Him, Isn't It? Because He Found Out It Was You. Hey, Sonny Dupree Killed Jerry Walsh, And Everybody Knows About It. Now, Are We Playing Cards Here Or What? I've Got A Witness Who Saw The Whole Thing Go Down, Colson, And He Describes You To A "T." So Arrest Me. No, No, Not Right Now. I've Got Some Loose Ends I Want To Tie Up First, But When I Do, I'll Know Where To Find You. You're Runnin' A Bluff. Hey, Damn It, Hunter, I Mean, I Don't Know Why You're Doing This Or What You Think You Got Here, But I For One Resent What You're Doing To Dan. Now, Either You Back Off, Or I'm Going To File A Complaint. Well, That's Your Prerogative, Weiker. But If I Was You, I'd Read That Printout First. It's Got Sonny Dupree's Rap Sheet On It Out Of Central Files, Not The One Walsh Dummied Up To Nail The Murderer. See You Guys. What? I Don't Believe This. What? Dupree's A Drunk Driver. Let Me See It. [Telephone Rings] I'll Get It. [Ring] Yeah? Thanks. Dan, When Jerry Got That Call About Dupree, Didn't He Say He Wasn't Going Out After Him, That It Was Too Dangerous? I Don't Know. I Don't Remember. Sure You Do. You Kidded Him About Once Having Been The Most Conscientious Parole Officer In The Department. Well, So He Changed His Mind. Now, Look, I Just Got An Important Phone Call, And I Got To Get Out Of Here. [Tires Squealing] ♪ Lock Down My Tune ♪ ♪ Lock Down My Tune ♪ ♪ Lock Down My Tune ♪ ♪ Lock Down My Tune ♪ Hunter: If You Get A Sighting On This Guy, Give Me A Call, Will You, Charlie? Yeah.

If He'd Let You Bring Him In In The First Place, He Wouldn't Be In Danger Now. Yeah, But He Didn't, And I Let Dan Get Loose. [Telephone Rings] Mccall. Yeah. I've Asked About That Tap Twice Now. You're Kidding Me! What? Ok, Thanks. They Refused Our Request For A Tap On The Dupree Phone. Well, They Can't Do That. We've Got Cause. Colson Beat Us To It. He Put One On About 4 Hours Before We Applied For Ours. I'm Going To Call Mrs. Dupree. [Ring] Hello? Hello, Mrs. Dupree? This Is Sergeant Mccall. Have You Heard From Your Husband? Why, No, I Haven't. You Sure? Yes. I'm Positive. Ok. Well, Uh, If He Does Contact You, Warn Him Not To Say Anything That Will Give Away His Whereabouts. Your Phone's Tapped. Mrs. Dupree, Did You Understand That? Yes. I Understand. Thank You. Uh, That's A Phone, Mccall, Remember? Mrs. Dupree Said Sonny Didn't Call. So? So The Way She Said It, I--I Don't Believe Her. But Why Would She Lie? I Don't Know.

Yeah, That's The Tap That Colson Had Put On The Dupree Phone. Hold It, And I'll Look It Up For You. Thank You. There Was A... Incoming Call To That Number At 2:47 P.M. From An Unnamed Male Caller. There Was A Second Call From A Female, A Sergeant Mccall Whom We've Identified As A Member Of The Lapd. Oh, Yes, Yes, We Already Have That, But Could You Please Give Me The Readout On The 2:47 Call? I Already Gave A Readout To Mr. Colson. Didn't He Tell You? No. Uh... I Was Out Of The Office Then, And He Is Now, But Our Supervisor Would Really Like That Information, So If It's No Bother... No Bother, Miss Sloan. Thank You. Pick Up Line 4. Uh, "Phone Rings Twice. "Female Voice: Hello. "Male Voice: Hello, Trish. "Female Voice: Sonny, Is That You? Are You All Right? Male Voice: I'm Ok. Now Listen." Female Voice Says, "Sonny, Where Are You?" "Male Voice: Don't Ask Any Questions, "Do As I Tell You. Pack A Suitcase With Enough Stuff "To Last You And Cindy A Few Days. "I'll Call You Later Around 5:30 And Tell You Where To Meet Me." It's 5:20. We Got To Roll! Uh, Listen, Uh, That Will Be Just Fine. I Do Have One More Request, Though. If Another Call Should Come In On This Line, Will You Please Notify Sergeant Mccall Via The Police Dispatcher? Thank You So Much. [Ring] [Ring] Now, You Remember What I Told You. No Tricks. [Ring] Hello? Trish? Baby, It's Sonny. Everything Ok? Yes. Everything's Fine. You Sure? You Sound Funny. Well, You Told Me Not To Ask You Any Questions And Only Do What You Tell Me. I'm Waiting To Hear. Ah, Good Girl. You All Packed And Ready To Go? Yes. Just Like You Said. Ok. I'm At The Phone Booth Around The Corner. Meet Me Here And Quick. Ok, Sonny, But It's Going To Take Us At Least An Hour To Get There. What Do You Mean An Hour? I Told You I'm Just Down The Corner. Yeah, Well... Macarthur Park's A Long Way From Here, And With The Traffic And All... Trish, Someone Up There With You, Baby? Is It Colson? Yes. Well... We'll Get There As Soon As We Can, Sonny. Bye. Oh, You Want To Play This Way? That's Fine. We'll Play That Way. Come On, Let's Go Get Sonny. No! You Throw The Gun In Here, Sonny, Or I'm Gonna Kill Her. All Right. Don't Hurt Her.

[Tires Squealing] Drop The Gun, Colson! Hunter, Let Me Get Rid Of This Guy. He's Nothing But Garbage. I Said Drop It. Now. Sonny! Sonny! Drop The Gun, Colson! All Right. Ok! Take It Easy. How's He Doing? He's Busted Up Some, But He'll Be Ok. How's Colson? All The City Has To Do Now Is Pick Him Up With The Trash And Take Him Away. ♪ Lock Down My Tune ♪ ♪ Lock Down My Tune ♪ [Officers Whistle] Ok, Roscoe, Let's Go. Hey, Mccall, What's The Deal Here?

You Could've Had Their Parole Revoked For What They Did To You. Maybe Another Time. Oh, Hey, Wait, Nina. Hey, Look. Ah, Look, I See Mccall All The Time. We Can Have Lunch Or Dinner Some Other Time, And Besides, Her...Her Taste In Food Is Not Really Mine. I'd Love To Have Dinner With You. What Would You Like To Eat? Uh, You Won't Believe This, But... I'd Really Like A Chili Dog. Excuse Me.
