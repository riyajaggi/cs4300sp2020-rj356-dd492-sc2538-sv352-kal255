 Hunter (1984â€“1991): Season 1, Episode 9 - High Bleacher Man - full transcript 
 Hunter and McCall apprehend Gavin, a murdering street punk. They later learn that he made a deal with the D.A. to implicate a mobster, Nate Demarest for four murders. Hunter knows if Gavin is back on the streets he will kill again. When Demarest tries to get Gavin, Hunter suggests limiting the number of people who knows his location and Gavin wants Hunter to be that person because he knows if anything happens to him Hunter will be under suspicion. It's while watching Gavin that McCall recalls she once investigated Demarest for killing a Fed but it went cold. Hunter asks her to reopen it cause it could give the D.A. Demarest without Gavin's testimony.

 You Got A License To Drive This Thing? [Woof] Whoa! Got Your Partner Here Looking Into Her Grave Unless You Do What I Say. It Goes With The Badge. Better You Than Me. It Works For Me. Hunter: I've Been After Gavin For Years. I Know His M.O. I Could Smell One Of His Jobs. That Sicko Is In The Municipal Building, Smiling At His Parole Officer, Swearing Goodness On The Bible, Then He's Marching Out Of There To Some Nearby Liquor Store

 And Taking It Down For A Couple Hundred Bucks And The Thrill Of Blowing The Owners Away. Look, On The Fifth, Gavin Got Out On Parole, And He Met With His Parole Officer For The First Time On The Seventh At 2:30. At 3:34 That Same Day, A Liquor Store 6 Blocks Away Is Robbed And A 66-Year-Old Man Is Pistol Whipped, A Gavin Trademark. Pistol Whipping Old Shopkeepers Is In Public Domain, Hunter. A Week Later, On The 14Th At 2:30, Gavin Meets His Parole Officer For The Second Time. At 3:23, Seven Blocks Away, A Mom-And-Pop Grocery Store Gets Hit, And Pop Winds Up A Vegetable From A Fractured Skull. And, The 21St At 3:44, Gavin Shows Up-- Ok, You Made Your Point. There He Is. Follow Me, But Don't Come In Unless There's Trouble. [Engine Won't Start] [Engine Cranking] Come On, Come On! [Engine Cranking] This Is A Heist. This Is A Bust, Gavin. Drop It. [Engine Starts] Don't Shoot, Hunter! Turn Around. You Have The Right To Remain Silent. If You Give Up That Right-- Come On, Hunter! If I Hear "You Got Rights" Once More, I'm Gonna Puke. No, You're Getting The Full Treatment, Scuzz. You're Not Gonna Get Out Of This On Some Technicality. Come On. Now, Before You Turned In Your Arrest Report On Gavin, You Make Sure You Double-Checked It To See If You Filled It Out Right? Yeah, I Told You. And You Also Included The Fact That I Read Him His Miranda Rights Before I Cuffed Him. Hunter, What Is This? I've Filled Out An Arrest Report Before, You Know? Look, I've Arrested This Guy Twice, Mccall. The First Time, He Crippled A Kid In A Gas Station With A Tire Iron Because He Couldn't Open The Cash Register Drawer. The Second Time, He Wasted A Little Old Lady Who Owns A Liquor Store In The Barrio In A $10 Heist. The Guy's Looking At 25 Years In The Slam For Sure, And I Want To Make Sure He Serves Every Minute. Hunter, Mccall! Oh, No! You Know You're Supposed To Report In Before You Take Your Lunch Break. Well, If The Captain Gave Us A Car With A Radio That Worked, We'd Be Glad To Comply, Bernie. That Excuse Is Getting Very, Very Tired, Mccall. Yes, Well, Uh, Maybe You Should Have That Fixed. In The Meantime, You Two Have Been Assigned To Me Regarding That, Uh, Killer You Brought In Yesterday, Uh, Gavin. That's Jail Duty. The Sheriff's In Charge. No, He's Not In Jail Anymore. He's Been Transferred To The Biltmore Plaza Hotel. We've Been Assigned To Guard Him Till After The Grand Jury. What? We Made A Deal With Gavin: Immunity From Prosecution And Relocation Under A New Name. Hunter: On What Basis? We Had Him Cold, In The Act With A Gun In His Hand. Who The Hell Do You Think You Are Questioning Decisions Made By Your Superiors? Since He Brought Gavin In, I Think Sergeant Mccall Deserves An Explanation, Captain. I'm Mccall, He's Hunter, But That's Ok. I'm Just As Hot Over This As He Is. What We Have Here Is Quite Simply A Quid Pro Quo. Do You Know What That Means? Yeah, I Scrub Your Back And You Scrub Mine, Only, If You Get Into A Tub With Gavin, You're Gonna Come Out Dirtier Than When You Went In. Well, In This Case, We Fully Intend To Cleanse The Entire City... Of Nate Demarest. Gavin's Giving You Demarest? You're Putting Us On. Murder One, 4 Counts. Enough To Put Demarest Away For The Rest Of His Life, Maybe Even Into The Gas Chamber. It's A Scam. Demarest Is In The High Bleachers, And A Punk Like Gavin Wouldn't Even Get Close To Him. Today, Maybe. But 10 Years Ago, Demarest Wasn't Much More Than A Punk Himself, Working His Way Up One Body At A Time. Gavin Knows Where Those Bodies Are Buried, And There's No Statue Of Limitations On Murder. Well, I'll Be At The Hotel With Gavin Going Over His Testimony If You Need Me. I Would Like To Commend You Both On Your Handling Of Gavin's Arrest. Your Conduct, Your Paperwork, Everything Was Perfect. That's Why He Gave Us Demarest. You Didn't Leave Him Any Other Out. So Thanks Again. You Cut Him Loose, He's Gonna Kill Again. He Won't Live Long Enough. Demarest Will See To That. Only Over Your Dead Body, Hunter, And Yours, Mccall. I'm Not Gonna Help Protect This Guy, Captain. No Way. Yeah, Me, Too. I Pass. I'm Not Asking For Volunteers. That's Part Of Mr. Gavin's Deal, That You Be Assigned This Duty, Hunter. Oh, Mr. Gavin's Request, Huh? That's Rich. I'll Bet He's Getting A Real Kick Out Of This. Let Me Pass On A Word Of Warning To You. If Gavin So Much As Catches A Cold, The Two Of You Are Going To Wind Up Directing Traffic. You Clear On That? A Sergeant Terwilliger Has Got The Guard Detail On This. He'll Give You Your Orders. That's It. I Really Appreciate This. Thanks. I Got To Talk To Talk To You, Nate. Sure. Excuse Me. Sure. What's The Problem? Gavin's Made A Deal With The D.A. He's Gonna Rat On You To Save His Own Skin. He's Gonna Rat On Me? He Goes In Front Of The Grand Jury Next Week. All Right, Call Mckay. Tell Him To Get Gavin Out On Bail And Bring Him To Me. I'm Gonna Do That Fink Myself. No, We Can't Do It That Way, Nate. They Moved Him From Jail To A Hotel Downtown. They're Watching Him 24 Hours A Day. I Don't Care Who's Watching Or Where. I Need Him Dead. I'm Taking Care Of It, Nate. Not To Worry. Corpse. When He's A Corpse, Then It's Not To Worry. See To It. How's It Going, Smitty? Well, Compared To Collecting Garbage For A Living, I Give It About A 4. Terwilliger's Idea. Bernie, What Do You Expect Demarest To Come After Him With, A Herd Of Elephants? Gavin: I Was Told To Finish Him Right There In The Car. So While Nate Was Driving Along, Uh, Uh, In The Car And Talking To Him, I, Uh, I Stuck A .22 In His Ear. You Got That? Yes, Sir. Ha Ha Ha Ha. And That Was All She Wrote. The Poor Slob Never Knew What Hit Him. For The Record, When You Say Nate Was Driving, Who Are You Referring To? Who The Hell Are We Talking About? Nate Demarest. It Was Nate Demarest. D-E-M-A-R-E-S-T. And He Paid You To Kill Mr. Caracus? 5 Big Ones. Hey, Hunter, How's It Going, Buddy Boy? It's Real Good To See You, And The Lady, Too. Didn't Catch Your Name, Kid. Oh, Excuse Me. Sergeant Mccall, This Is Elton Gavin. I Know Who The Creep Is. Give It A Chance, Baby. To Know Me Is To Love Me. Well, Even Your Mother Would Give You An Argument On That. Hunter, My Man. You Know, If Any Cop Knows What The Mob's Up To, It's Gotta Be Him. I Mean, It's All In The Familia, Right? Mr. Gavin, Could We Please Get On With This? All Right. I'll Talk To You Later, Kid, Huh? Hands Off. Like I Said, To Know Me Is To Love Me. Duck! He's Headed Down. Well, That's One Down. Yeah, And How Many More To Go? As Many As Nate Figures It'll Take. You Could Have Half The Police Department In Here With Gavin, That Wouldn't Stop Demarest. He Needs Him Dead. And Believe Me, If He Has To Blow Up This Entire Hotel To Do It, He'll Do It. He's Right. We've Got To Move Him. Do You Have Any Suggestions, Captain? Not Right Off The Top Of My Head, No. But I'm Sure We Can Find Someplace To Secure Better Than This. That Won't Cut It. Nate Will Have This Place Cased And Staked Out Before You Can Move Gavin In. What Do You Suggest? Well, I Suggest You Put Him With 2 Cops And Let Them Decide Where To Put Him. Then Only They'd Know. Yeah, I Like That. Yeah, Hunter's Right On The Money. You Know, My Own Experience, When I Had A Contract, The More People Knew Where The Pigeon Was, The Easier It Was To Find Him. So Where Are You Gonna Put Me, Huh, Huh, Huh? Not Me, Scuzz. Yeah, You! Because With Your Family Tree, Nate Nails Me, Your Guys Nail You For Selling Me Out. Now, Ain't That Right, Fellas? Well, You Sure Did It To Us That Time. We're Gonna Have To Baby-Sit That Creep All By Ourselves. Well, If I Were You, Mccall, I'd Bail Out. You Know, Gavin's Right. The Only Way They're Gonna Believe I'm Straight Is If I Get Myself Blown Up Trying To Protect This Guy. You Wouldn't Want To Share That With Me, Would You? I Told You I Don't Want To Share Anything With Any Partner. Let's Go Find A Hiding Hole For, Uh, Gavin. He Missed. He Missed? Damn It, Jullie, You Said He Was The Best. What The Hell Happened? I Don't Know What Happened. All I Know Is He Missed. But The Cops, They Didn't Miss. They Took Him Out Hard. Crazy Gavin. You Know, Everything I've Done For Him, And He Turns On Me This Way. I Need Him Dead, Jullie. I Don't Care If You Have To Take Out 100 People, As Long As He's One Of 'Em. It's Not Gonna Be That Easy. They Moved Him From The Hotel. Aren't We Paying People Who Know These Things? They're Playing It Real Cozy. They Turned Him Over To 2 Cops, And These 2 Cops Are The Only People Who Know Where He Is. One's This Hardball Named Rick Hunter, The Other's His Partner Some--Some Broad-- Rick Hunter? You Mean, Dom's Nephew? Yeah. Well, Get To Him, Set Up A Meet. This Guy Will Not Do Business-- Not For Money, Not Even For Family. Jullie, Everybody Does Business If The Price Is Right. Put It On The Wire I Want To See Him. You Got It, Nate. [Dog Barks] [Bark Bark Bark Bark] [Bark Bark Bark] Hey, Hunter, I Want Lots Of Cream And Sugar In My Coffee When It's Ready, Ok? I Said I Want Lots Of Cream And Sugar In My Coffee When It's Ready! And, Mccall, I Want Eggs Over Easy, Bacon, Crisp, 2 Pieces Of Toast. [Bark Bark Bark] That Damn Dog! Leave It To You To Put Me Next Door To A Mangy Mouthed Mutt. How Do You Think He Feels Living Next Door To You? And Make Sure You Don't Burn The Toast. Mccall: Breakfast Is Served. [Bark Bark] I Don't Know Why The Hell I Agreed To All This. I Should Have Stayed In The Hotel. Maybe It Was Because You Were Afraid Your Old Buddy Nate Might Catch Up With You There. Hey, Don't Give Me That "Old Buddy Nate" Garbage. I Gave Nate His First Joint In Hollywood, And The Hookers, And The Franchise To Peddle Dope In That Area That Went With It. And You Know What My Old Buddy Nate Give Me For It? My Own Street Corner, So I Could Peddle Nickel Bags From. I Feel Sorry For You, Gavin. You've Had A Tough Life. Hey, Hunter, You Got A Big Mouth. [Bark Bark Bark Bark] You Keep Gavin Away From Me, Hunter, Or So Help Me-- Just Keep Telling Yourself That After Trying For Years, Gavin Has Finally Given The D.A. A Way To Nail Demarest. [Bark Bark Bark] Ok, All Right. We Hear You. [Bark Bark] You Know What The Real Twist Is Here? Me And My Old Partner Had Him 7 Years Ago For Murder. Really? Yeah. The Feds Slid A Narc Into One Of Nate's Places As A Bartender. It Was A Guy Name Of Lamasso. One Day, He Showed Up Dead. The Word Was That Nate Found Out Who He Was And Iced Him Personally. Well, Didn't You Go After Him? Well, The Feds Said That They Made A Thorough Investigation And Didn't Come Up With Any Evidence That Would Have Proven That He Didn't Commit Suicide. Mrs. Lamasso Said That's Because They Didn't Look Hard Enough. Well, Do You Think You Could Find Her Now? What's The Point? They Didn't Listen To Her Then, They're Not Going To Listen To Her Now. Look, If We Can Send Those 2 Guys Away-- Demarest And Gavin-- We Gotta Go For It. All Right. Ok, I'll Take A Run On Down To Records And See If I Can Get A Line On Where She Is. Yeah. [Bark Bark Bark] [Bark Bark Bark Bark] Woman: Boscoe! Oh, I'm Sorry. [Bark Bark Bark] Is He For Real? Boscoe, Get Out Of This Car This Minute! Come On, Big Fella. Whoa! He's Never Done That Before. Boscoe. Remember That Dope-Sniffing Dog That Worked Narcotics? Well, The Last Time They Used Her In This Car, She Was In Heat. [Bark Bark] Boscoe's In Love. I'll Get Him Out. Come On, Boscoe. Come On. I'll Take My Car. Boscoe, What's Come Over You? Wherever The Hell She's Going, I Hope She Gets Some Beer, On Account Of We're Running Out. You Know, If You Put On A Cleaner T-Shirt, You'd Make A Much Better Target Standing There Out In The Open Where Everybody Can See You. Mrs. Lamasso, Alma, I Happen To Agree With You. I Think Your Husband Was Murdered Because Somebody Blew His Cover. Besides Me, Only The Drug Enforcement Agency Knew Tony Was An Undercover Narc. Not Even Chrissy Knew. Chrissy? That Was Your Daughter? We Never Had Any Children. Please. My Tony Is Dead. I'm A Woman Alone. Dredging It All Up Again Won't Change That. Now, I Know It's Painful To Talk About It, Even After All These Years, But It's The Only Way We're Going To Be Able To Get The Guy That Killed Him. She Became Like A Daughter. Chrissy. Chrissy Allen. She Was A Singer At That Place, The Golden Grotto, One Of Those Foolish Kids Who Come Here From The Farm, Thinking They Can Become Big Stars Overnight. Tony Took Her Under His Wing, So To Speak. Were...Tony And Chrissy, Uh... No! No, No. Not Tony. He Didn't Fool Around Like That... Ever. He Was There For Information Then? That's What He Was There For. But He Was Really Concerned About Her, And He Did What He Could To Protect Her From The Kind Of Element That Hung Around That Place. Have You Heard From Chrissy Since Your Husband Died? No, I Haven't Heard From Her. After All Tony Did For Her, Not A Phone Call, Not A Post Card. Well, Thank You, Alma. And I'm Sorry. I Know How Painful It Is To Drudge Up The Memories. You Would Think After All These Years It Would Be Easier, But Every Night, I... [Dog Barks] Hunter: Take It Easy, Will You, Boscoe? Yeah, You Were Saying? This Chrissy Allen, I Don't Think She'd Just Ignore The Death Of A Guy That Treated Her Like She Was His Own Daughter, Not Unless She Had A Good Reason. I Know This Waitress At The Golden Grotto. She's Been There For Years. She Owes Me A Couple Of Favors. You'll Be Ok Here With Gavin? [Dog Barks] Hey, Mccall. Did You Get Any Beer? You Know Something? I Forgot. Well, You'd Better Start Remembering, 'Cause When My Throat Gets Dry, I Can't Talk, You Know What I Mean? Hunter: Don't Worry, Gavin, I'll Pick It Up. [Bark] It's Ok, Big Fella, Just Stay Right Where You Are. I'll Need To Borrow Your Car, Mccall. Mine Just Got Married. [Bark Bark Bark] Uh, I'm Warning You, Hunter. Trust Me. Not A Scratch? Not A Scratch, I Swear. [Bark Bark Bark] Hey, Mccall, I Want To Ask You Something. Uh... Is He Going For The Beer? Yeah. Uh-Huh. Oh, Wait, Wait, Wait. This Is, Uh, This Is Something Else. Um... As Long As We're Stuck Here Together, Why Don't We Make The Best Of It? I Mean, Like, I'll Forget You're A Cop, And You Treat Me Like I'm Just Another Guy, What Do You Say? If I'm Gonna Keep You Alive, Gavin, I Can't Afford To Get Emotionally Involved. Woman: A Singer Named Chrissy, Huh? Whatever Happened To Her, Do You Remember? Well, You Know How This Business Is. Kids Like Her, They Come And Go. Yeah. Let Me Speak To Whitey Mcfee. Thank You. Yeah? Whitey, This Is Condon Down At The Golden Grotto. You Asked Me To Let You Know If Hunter Ever Been Around, Right? Well, Bingo, I'm Looking Right At Him. Do Me A Favor, Will You? I Can Be There In 5 Minutes. If He Looks Like He's Leaving Right Away, Uh, Stall Him For A Couple Of Minutes, Ok? Hey, I'll Do The Best I Can. Ok, I Owe You One. Oh, I Know You Do, And I'm Gonna Collect. Remember The Time They Planted That Narc On Nate? Vic Sellers Was What We Knew Him As, But I Never Thought That Really Was His Name. Yeah, That's Him. How Long Was She Around Here After He Turned Up Dead? It Was, Like, The Next Day. She Never Came Around Anymore. Well, You Think There's A Connection? Nate Might Have Known That, Uh, She Was Getting It On With One Of The Bouncers, A Guy Named Whitey Mcfee. Big, Good-Looking Guy, Heavyweight, Used To Box Out Of Nate's Stable? Oh, Uh, Look, Hunter, Uh, My Boss Wants Me. Yeah, Ok. Thanks, Teri. Yeah. What Is It, Eddie? Teri, Can I Talk To You For A Second? Yeah. All Right, Come Here. What's The Matter? [Sobbing] Teri, What's Wrong? What Happened? Yeah, What Do You Want? Well, Teri Wanted Me To Give You Something. Oh, Yeah? Hunter, What Are You Doing? You Can't Barge Into A Man's House Like This. I Don't Like Being Shot At. All Right, Let It Go. Let It Go. I Want To Talk To Hunter... Alone. All Right, Everybody, Get Out Of Here! What The Hell Is This, Hunter? You Gone Crazy? I Told You I Don't Like Being Shot At. Somebody Shot At You, You Saying It's Me? Now I Know You're Crazy. Oh, Not You, Nate. You Don't Do Your Killing Anymore. You Just Put The Word Out And Have It Done. I Put The Word Out I Wanted To Talk To You. If You Had Any Smarts, You Would Have Rang My Bell, Walked In Here Like A Human Being, Instead Of Busting In Here Like Some Animal. We Would Have Had A Little Drink, A Little Chat. You Might Have Walked Out Of Here A Rich Man. You Still Can. For Gavin? Just Tell Me Where He's At. It's Worth 50 Thou. I'd Be Taking Your Money Under False Pretenses, Demarest. Don't Be Stupid. I Could Give Gavin To You, But It Wouldn't Do You Any Good. You Know Why? Because I've Got You, And I'm Gonna Put You Away Without Gavin. You Hear That? He's On To Something. I Want You To Find Out What It Is, And I Want You To Take Care Of Him, Now. I Don't Believe This. The Whole Side Of My Car Is Ruined. Hunter, This Is My Car, Not The City's. I Don't Believe This, Mccall. I Could've Taken 3 Slugs In The Neck, And All You Care About Is Your Damn Vehicle. You Get Shot, You Get Hospitalization. I Don't Even Know If I'm Covered For This Kind Of Damage. [Sighs] All Right, What'd You Find Out? Well, Chrissy Wasn't As Innocent As Mrs. Lamasso Said. She Was Being Kept By Demarest And, At The Same Time, She Was Getting It On With A Bouncer, A Jock By The Name Of Whitey Mcfee. I've Heard That Name. Yeah. He Was A Pretty Good Fighter At One Time-- A Heavyweight-- Until Nate Sent Him Into The Tank Once Too Often, And The Boxing Commission Jerked His License. Oh, So Nate Found Out And Got Rid Of Them Both. No. Whitey Still Works For Nate, But I Think We Ought To Get Ahold Of This Guy And Talk To Him. I'll Call It In. Must Be Boscoe's Dinnertime. You Leave Me Alone With Gavin, And One Of Us Isn't Going To Be Here When You Get Back. You Call In On Whitey, And I'll Take Care Of Gavin. This Is Sergeant Mccall. Patch Me Into R And I. Ok, Gavin, You're On Your Own For A While. Mccall And I Gotta Go Someplace. No Way. It Doesn't Make Any Difference If We're Here Or Not. Your Real Protection Comes From The Fact That Nobody Knows You're Here. I Said, "No Way." You Leave Me Alone-- You And Mccall-- I'm Gonna Call District Attorney Harvey. Well, Call Harvey. Call Nate While You're At It. Maybe If You Get Lonesome, He Can Send The Buddy Of The Guy Who Took A Shot At You From The Roof. Bye, Dear. You Cover The Back In Case Nate's Reached Him. I Told Him Not To Cooperate. I Think I'd Have A Better Chance Of Getting Him To Talk. He Wouldn't Be Expecting A Woman. Look, Trust Me On This, Ok? Better Me Than You. Whitey? Sergeant Rick Hunter. Can I Have A Word With You? Sorry. I'm Busy. It'll Just Take A Minute. All Right. Let Me Get My Stuff From My Locker. I'll Be With You In A Minute. Whitey, Hold Up. I'm Warnin' Ya. Hold It Right There, Whitey. You Were Right, Hunter. Better You Than Me. Why Don't You Call In For A Van For Him? I'll Get His Stuff. All Right, Whitey. Turn Around, Put Your Hands Behind Your Back. This Is Hunter. I Got A Suspect For Ya, Forskey's Gym In The Harbor Marina. Look Familiar? Yeah. The Guy Who Took A Shot At Me Was Wearin' Somethin' Just Like This. How Many Shots Did You Say He Fired? 3. Hmm. Now, Why In The Hell Would You Want To Take A Shot At Me? We Haven't Even Said Hello. What Else Do You Got? Nothing Much, Just Junk. There Is A Wallet, Though. Here. Hey, Come On. That's Personal. You Got No Right To Go Through It. Settle Down, Big Fella. You'll Get This Back When They Kick You Loose. Hey, Mcfee... You Still Live At The Shaklin Hotel On Florita Street? No, No. I Never Lived There, Man. I've Been Livin' At The Claire On Division For The Past 6 Years. Go Check It Out. Then Why Are You Still Payin' Rent On A Place In Pomona? Hunter: So What Do You Think? Same Girl? Yeah. It Looks Like Her, Only She Doesn't Seem To Be Whitey's Type. Let's Go Find Out. Yes? Excuse Me. You Miss Duragaway? No, I'm Not. I'm-- You're Chrissy Allen, Right? Hey, Jullie, Thank Mr. Demarest For Bailin' Me Out So Fast. You Know, I Really Appreciate It. Whitey, Why Don't You Thank Him Yourself? Oh, Come On. What's Up? Nothin's Happenin'. Just Get In The Car. Let's Go. Look, I'd Like To Help You. I Really Would, But I Don't Know Anything, Really. But You've Buried Yourself Out Here In Pomona For 7 Years. Why? I Decided It Wasn't The Kind Of Life I Really Wanted, Being A Singer. Well, Whitey Tried To Kill Me Because I Was Asking Questions About You At The Golden Grotto. That's A Pretty Heavy Rap, Killin' A Cop. He Didn't Risk That Because He Thought You Were Disillusioned With Show Business. You're Hiding, Chrissy, Because You're Afraid Of Nate Demarest. Now, You Know Something About The Lamasso Killing, Don't Ya? Nate Demarest Has His Back Up Against A Wall. He Will Eliminate Anybody He Thinks Can Help Put Him Away. Now, We Found You Easy Enough, And Demarest Has Got A Better Set Of Wires Than We Do. [Sighs] Nate Thinks I'm Dead. Whitey Told Him He'd Killed Me. Whitey Told Him? Why? I Saw It. Well, I Mean, I Didn't Exactly See It Happen. I Mean... I Was In The Car In The Parking Lot, Waiting For Whitey To Take Me Home That Night. We Had To Be Very Careful About Being Seen Together Because Nate Was Terribly Possessive, And He Would Have Had Us Both Killed If He'd Known We Were Seeing Each Other. Anyway, I Saw Nate And Jullie And Whitey Come Out Of The Kitchen Door. Whitey And Nate Were Carrying A Body. It Was Him... Tony Lamasso. Are You Positive? I Saw His Face As Clearly As I'm Seeing Yours. What Did They Do With Him? Well, Then They Put Him In The Trunk Of Nate's Car And Drove Away. And Then What Did You Do? I Went Home. I Didn't Know What To Do. I Just Sat There In The Dark Until Whitey Came. He Said That Nate Had Been Tipped Off That He Was A Narc And Had Him Killed And That I Was Next. Why You? You Didn't Know He Was A Narc. I'd Been Friendly With Him. That Was Reason Enough For Nate. What Did You Do, Then? Well, Whitey Had Me Pack Some Things, And He Brought Me To A Motel, And Then Every Few Days He'd Bring Me To Another One And Then Another Until, Finally, He Brought Me Here. I've Been Here Ever Since. [Coughing] Well? I Don't Know. [Mccall Coughs] Well, I Think We'd Have A Better Chance Of Getting To The Precinct In My Car. When You Get There, Call In. Hello, Jullie. Yeah, Um... Jullie, Uh, Is Nate Still Lookin' For Chrissy Allen? I'm A Friend Of Nate's, That's Who. Um... Yeah, Chrissy Allen That Used To Work At The Golden Grotto? That's Right. If He Still Wants To Find Her, I Know Where He Can Find Her. [Bark Bark Bark Bark] [Bark Bark Bark Bark Bark] [Grr] Welcome Back, Boscoe. Did You Have A Nice Dinner? You Got A License To Drive This Thing? [Barking] Here's Your Beer. Only A Six-Pack? What? Are You Gonna Move Me Someplace? Yeah. To A Security Cell On The County Jail. Mccall's Down There Right Now, Settin' It Up For Ya. Oh... [Tires Squealing] [Squealing] What's Wrong? I Think We're Being Followed. All Right, Just Hold On. If I Was You, I'd Be Worried About My Buddy Mccall And Chrissy Allen. I Saw Her Gettin' Outta Your Car. I Know Who She Is, Man. She's Your Ace In The Hole, Right? Right. Heh. Heh Heh Heh... That's If You Get To Play Her. [Bark Bark Bark] [Dialing] Yeah. This Is Hunter. Patch Me Into Mccall's Frequency, And Hurry, Would You, Please? Dispatcher: Car 24, Car 56 Calling. Car 24, Sergeant Mccall, Will You Please Respond? I'm Sorry. Sergeant Mccall Is Not Responding. Look, Captain, All I Can Tell You Is Mccall Was On Her Way Back To The Precinct With A Very Important Witness Against Nate Demarest When She Disappeared. You've Lost Gavin? No. I Haven't Lost Gavin. I'm Starin' Right At His Ugly Face. It's Mccall That I'm Worried About. She's Bringing In A Witness That's Even More Important Than Gavin. Look, I Don't Know What You're Ravin' About, Hunter, And I Don't Wanna Know. I Want You To Bring Gavin In Right Now, And We'll Hold Him At The Precinct Until More Suitable And Safer Arrangements Can Be Made. I'm Sorry, But I Can't Do That, Captain. No. That's A Direct Order, Hunter! You Thought You Could Sneak In Chrissy Allen Instead Of Me, Huh? You Tipped Off Demarest? A Man's Got A Right To Protect His Interests. If Anything Happens To Mccall, Anything At All, Gavin, You're Gonna Die A Very Slow, Painful Death. You're Already In Enough Trouble. Don't Add Kidnap Arrest Of A Police Officer, Demarest. You Know, If Gavin Testifies, They're Gonna Have Me In For 4 Murders. One Murder More's Not Gonna Make A Lot Of Difference. What About Chrissy And Whitey? Worry About Yourself. Get Hunter On The Phone For Me. [Dialing] [Ring] Yeah? Hunter, Mccall-- Hunter... Nathan Demarest. I've Got Your Partner Here, Looking Into Her Grave Unless You Do What I Say. I Want Gavin. Forget It. No Way. I Don't Think You Understand, Pal. Unless You Play Ball With Me, Mccall's Going Mahula, You Know What I Mean? You're A Cop. You Take Risks. It Goes With The Badge. He Didn't Negotiate? No. Give Me The Phone. [Ring] Yeah. Hunter, Mccall. [Dial Tone] He Hung Up. All Right, You Make Sure You Nail Gavin Outside The Courthouse. All Right, And What About Them? You Know What To Do With Them. Augie! Wait A Minute, Nate. What? Wait A Minute. You're A Cop. You Take Risks. Yeah, Well, Not Me, Not For Slime Like Gavin. You Want Him, You Got Him. Ok. Where? What About Them? Well, We'll Talk About Them When You Give Me Gavin. Where Has Hunter Got Him? I Might Be Chicken, Nate, But I'm Not Stupid. I'll Show You. No, No, No. Show Them. I Got An Appointment. Jullie. I'll See You At The Party, Huh? Don't Bring Any Guests. What Are You Doin'? What Are You Doin' With The Curtain? Hey, Stone Face, What Are You Doin' With The Curtain? Shut Up. What's... What Are You, Nuts Or Somethin'? What Are You Doin' With The Curtain, Man? Tell Me What You're Doin'. Mccall: That's It. The Trailer At The End Of The Street. You Don't Need Me Anymore. You Stay Put Till I Tell You. Hunter! Let's Make It Easy. Hunter! If You Send Gavin Out, You Won't Get Hurt. Ok, Fellas... Hey, You Really Had Me Worried There For A Second. When You Hung Up, I Knew You Hadn't Gone Completely Over The Edge. Here. You'll Need That. Hunter: Ok, Jullie! You've Had Your Fun. Drop Your Guns, All Of You! Hey, Hunter, Get Me Out Of Here Before I Get Killed! Who Are All These People? These Are Vicious Criminals, Bernie. Wally, Call For An Ambulance And A Fire Truck, Will Ya? A Man And A Woman Are Being Held Captive In Lemke's Garage On Brille Avenue. Please Use Caution. The Captors Are Armed. I Certainly Hope You Can Explain This, Hunter. It's Pretty Self-Explanatory. Hey, Hunter, Take These Things Off Me! That's Gavin Handcuffed Over There. Do Me A Favor, Will You, Bernie? Read Him His Rights And Book Him Downtown Under An Open Charge Till We Get Back? Read Him His Rights? Hunter, That's Gavin. He's A Protected Witness. Not Anymore, Bernie. I Guess We're Finished Here. Yep. You Have The Right To Remain Silent, Gavin. Hey, Wait A Minute. What's This Reading-Me- My-Rights Routine? I'm Immune! Not According To Hunter. Don't You Move. I Mean It. Don't You Move. Help! An Officer Needs Assistance. Settle Down Now, Gavin. Stay Back, Or I'll Blow Him Away! You'll Blow Your Immunity, Too, Gavin. Who Are You Kiddin'-- Immunity? You've Already Blown It Away, And I Want Keys To A Car Now! No More Horsin' Around! I Mean It! Ok, Take It Easy. Take Mine. It's Right Behind You. Throw 'Em Over Here! Oh... Nobody Follows Me, Or He Gets It! You Hear What I'm Sayin' To Ya? [Grr] Hunter! [Grr] [Bark Bark Bark Bark] What's Goin' On Here, Hunter? It's A Little Complicated Right Now, Bernie, But We Gotta Go To A Party. I'm Gonna Tell The Captain! [Grr] His Generosity To Our Hospital Fund... As Well As His Unselfish Devotion To The Welfare Of All The People Of This City Are Too Well-Known And Too Limitless To Enumerate Here, Let Me, Therefore, Simply, Give You The Man Himself... Nate Demarest. [Applause] Excuse Me. Mr. Chairman, Honored Guests, Ladies And Gentlemen... I Have A Few Words Of My Own I Would Like To Bestow Upon Your Host And Benefactor Nate Demarest. You're Under Arrest. You Have The Right To Remain Silent. If You Give Up That Right To Remain Silent, Anything You Say Can And Will Be Used Against You In A Court Of Law. I'll Tell You What. This Time He's Got Us Right Where He Wants Us. He's Gonna Nail Us, Hunter. You Think So? Hunter... Mccall... Well, Let's Go Find Out. Heh. No. Don't Sit Down. You Won't Be Here Long Enough To Get Comfortable. Mr. Harvey Has Presented A List Of Charges Against You Two And Given Them To The Department, Including "Willful And Reckless Disregard "For The Safety Of A State's Witness, "Obstruction Of Justice, Dereliction Of Duty," Etc., Etc., Ad Infinitum. The List Goes On And On And On. Well, There Were Some Extenuating Circumstances, Captain. Any One Of These Charges Is Grounds For Dismissal From The Force, But Taken Together, They Represent A Malfeasance Of A Magnitude I Have Never Seen In All My Years As A Police Officer. Don't Drag It Out, Captain. Just Give Us The Bad News. I'm Givin' It To You, Hunter. The D.A. Has Decided Since You Two Enabled The County To Preempt The State's Case Against Demarest And Invalidate The Immunity Of Thomas Gavin, They'll Drop The Charges In Return For A Reprimand. That's The Bad News? Oh, It Is For Me. It Means I Have To Continue To Put Up With The Both Of You. Hey, But I'm Warnin' You, At The Slightest Infraction, You Guys Bend The Rules At All, And I Swear I Will Come Down On You So Hard.
