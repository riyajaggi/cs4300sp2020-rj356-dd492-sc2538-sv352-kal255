I Thought We Learned What A Warrant Was Our First Semester At The Academy. Seems You Didn't Do Too Well On Your Annual Qualifications, Hunter. I Got A 98 On The Target Shoot. But You Didn't Exactly Get A Perfect Score On Your Defensive Driving Course. I Hit One Cone. What's That? Well, Translated Into The Real World, Maybe It's One Parked Car, Maybe It's One Fire Hydrant, Maybe It's One Innocent Bystander. And Maybe You Ought To Let Mccall Do The Driving From Now On. I'm An Excellent Driver. Besides, When You're Out In The Field, Your Adrenaline Gives You That Extra Edge. Can We Talk About This? Why Am I Going To Pick Up The Chief? Because He's The Suspect In An Armed Robbery. Now, That's Not A Logic That Should Escape A Homicide Detective. Look, We Know He's Waiting For His Partner. We Also Know He Doesn't Have The Money. Now, Mccall's Got Him Staked Out, So Why Don't We Just Wait? Because We've Been Sitting On This Guy For A Week. Now, I Want Him Brought In Now, Before All We Got Left Is The Dust That He Kicks Up When He Splits Town. I'll Radio Mccall. No, You Won't. You'll Go Down There Now. That's Crazy. Well, It's Crazy Having You Two For Partners. Now, Your Butt's On The Line If You Don't Round Me Up A Steer On This One. And Don't Slam The Door! Oh, I Wouldn't Think Of It, Captain, But Sometimes It's Just A Reflex Action. [Slam] Sorry, I Don't Smoke. Let's Shag It, Mccall. [Car Horn Honks] Mccall: Get Lost! How Did You Know It Was Me? I'm A Trained Detective. Chief Is Still Sitting, Huh? Hasn't Left. No One's Come In. What Are You Doing Here, Anyway? I Got This Covered. What? Look, I've Already Gone Over This With The Captain. If We Don't Bring Him In, He's Going To Have Terwilliger Do It. Great. All Right, I'll Take The Front. Hunter: Oh, Yeah? Yeah, If I Go In There Dressed Like This, No One's Going To Think Twice. With You, They'll Know It's A Roust. Yeah, Well, Don't Make Any Friends, Ok? Huh. [On Television] I'm Going To Count To 3 And Shoot. One... [Gunshots] Woody Woodpecker: Hope I Don't See Him No More. Woody: And It Might As Well Be You. Woody: Off To Jail, Bad Man. Open The Door! Police! We Have A Warrant! [Gunshot] Yaah! Hold It! Yaah! Aaaah! All Right, Put The Rifle Down. Whoa, Hoss. You Got It. Come On. Get Them Up! Come On Down Here. Anything You Say, Officer. At Least I Hope You're An Officer, Or, Uh, I Just Went And Stepped In It. I Think You Went And Stepped In It Anyway, Partner. What's Going On? Call The Coroner. Now, Just What Was That Little Bit Of Business, Huh? Well, If You Look In My Breast Pocket Inside, You'll Find Something To Explain All This, All Right? Go On, Look. Look, Why Don't We Just Hogtie This Little Beaut And Go Have Ourselves A Brew. What Do You Say? Keep Them Up There. Well, As You Can See, That's A Wanted Poster. It's A $10,000 Reward On The Head Of That Indian For A Murder Back In Jersey. It Doesn't Excuse You Throwing That Rifle Around Like Buffalo Bill Cody, Now, Does It? What, Are You Crazy? Guy Had A Bead On You. I Saved Your Life. I Helped You Out. Oh, Come Off Of It. You Had To Hear Both Shotgun Blasts. He Jumped Out Of The Damn Window. He Didn't Have Enough Time To Reload. Both Barrels Were Empty. Well, I Guess I Just Don't Have The Ears And Instincts That You Do, Hoss, Do I? No, I Guess You Don't. And Now You Don't Have Anybody To Return For This Reward. You See, This Is Why It Reads "Dead Or Alive." [Police Radio] You Buy This Guy's Story? Drop Them Dead In Their Tracks Went Out With Scalping. Yeah, My Stomach's Doing Once-Overs, Which Tells Me This Guy Doesn't Smell Right From The Ground Up. Want Me To Take A Run At Him? What Are You Going To Do? Wave Your Magic Wand At This Guy And Expect Him Just To Spew Out The Almighty Truth? Something Like That. Now, You Want Me To Find Out What His Story Is Or What? Help Yourself. Mccall: I Don't Believe This, I Mean, Like, I Didn't Do Nothing But, Like, Go Answer The Call Of Nature, And You Guys Is Coming Through The Door Like The Incredible Hulk's In The John Or Something. Well, It's All Of A Sudden, The Chief Is Flying Through The Window Like He's Got Some Sort Of Magic Flying Power, Like He's Got Wings Out Of His Back Or Something. All I'm Doing Is Making An Outsider Feel To Home, Right? Huh? You Ever Been Away From Home, Huh? You Know How It Is. You Away From Home, Huh? I Can Tell. Yeah, I Can Tell. I Got A Nose For That. You Know Anybody In This Area? Well, You're A Real Talkative Type, Ain't You? Listen, If You Don't Mind Me Asking, You Got Some Sort Of A Personal Reason For Wanting To Kill The Chief? Nothing Personal At All, Sweet Pea. Just 10 Gs. 10 Gs? What? Are You Kidding? He Owed You 10 Gs? He Owed A Lot Of People A Lot Of Things. Me, I'm Just Upholding The Law. I Go Around Cleaning Up What The Cops Can't, Finish My Business, And I'm On My Way. Well, If You Got Any Business To Finish With The Chief, I Think Your Business Is Just About As Finished As It's Going To Be. You Know What I Mean? Well, Uh, Mr. Man In Black... If You're Going To Be Around, I'm Going To Be Around. Not Unless You Know Somebody By The Name Of Panhandle Pete. Panhandle Pete? Is He A Party Kind Of Guy Or What? Not With You. I Don't Think You're His Type. Of Course...Ha Ha! You're Not My Type Either. Would You Wake Me When We Land? Hmm? [Telephone Rings] Hunter. I Think I Did A Pretty Good Job, Considering The Guy Doesn't Like Women. Doesn't Like Women? Just Because You Couldn't Kick-Start Him, He Doesn't Like Women? Yeah, Give Me Everything You Got. Oh, You Think This Is Some Sort Of Defense On My Part, Huh? Is That What You Think? Yeah. Yeah, Go Ahead. Well, It's Not. Look, It Just So Happens I Can Tell When A Guy Is Interested, And When He Just Doesn't Have The Right Engine. Yeah, Thanks. Got It. So, The Guy's Gay Now, Huh? Mccall: No, He's Not Gay. He's Just--There's A Piece Missing, That's All. Sure. Look, You Let Me Worry About How To Handle Men, And You Worry About Your Driving, Ok? My Driving? Is It All Over The Precinct? Yeah. I Don't Believe It. Anybody Can Knock Over A Couple Of Cones. Hey, It Was Not A Couple Of Cones. It Was One Cone, And It Was On A Practice Test Course, Not Out On A Major Highway-- Forget It. It's Forgot. All Right, What Do You Got On Our Doc Holliday? Well, Apparently, The Guy's Notorious In A Couple Of States. He's Considered Persona Non Grata In Texas And Idaho. Police Departments Never Did Like Bounty Hunters. They're Scavengers. Yeah, Listen To This. In The Last Year, He's Collected Over 20 Bounties... All Dead, Shot In Self-Defense. Thank You. And He's Sticking Around To Waste Another Dude By The Name Of Panhandle Pete. You Think? That's His M.O. Yeah, This Is Sergeant Mccall. Look, I Want You To Run Down Some Information On A Guy Named Panhandle Pete. He's A Fugitive. He's Probably A Bail Jumper. No, That's All I Have. Check The Southwest, Texas Panhandle. It's All I Got. Well, Jimmy Joe, I Guess You're Getting Ready To Ride Off Into The Sunset. Why Don't You Let Me Take You Down To The Airport? My Way Of Saying Thanks. You Know, That's Real Neighborly Of You, But I Wasn't Aiming On Leaving Just Yet. I Hope You're Not Aiming For Panhandle Pete. That Little Twist Done Me In, Didn't She? No, I Ran Your Record, Partner. Believe Me, I Know Your Game, And It's Not Going To Fly Here, So Why Don't You Just Saddle Up And Move On Out? You Got A Piece Of Legal Paper On Me? Because If You Do, I'd Love To See It, You Understand? Well, I Was Kind Of Afraid You Weren't Going To Be Able To Read Anything That Didn't Have "Dead Or Alive" Printed On It. Ha Ha! You're A Very Funny Man. You Make Me Laugh. Except You Know What? Dead Men? They Ain't Funny. Do You Really Think He's Going For It, Even Though He Knows We Know? Yeah, Somehow I Think That Makes It Better For Him. Although, It's Going To Be Pretty Hard For Him With Two Cops Hitched To His Rear Bumper. Yeah, Well, With The Chief Dead, We Don't Have Any Leads To The Second Man In The Robbery. The Case Is Completely Closed. So, Let's Go For It. Yeah. [Door Closes] Hunter: Well, Ain't We Up With The Roosters, Jimmy Joe? You Got The Grip Of A Bull Terrier, Hoss. And You're Cuter Than A Speckled Pup Underneath A Covered Wagon. So Why Don't We Just Drop The Down-Home By-Jiminies And Let Me Help You Carry Your Bags To The City Limits. Yeah, I Do Believe What You're Doing Is Called Harassment. And I Do Believe What You're Planning On Doing Is Committing First-Degree Murder. You Know, If I Was After Somebody, It Would Take A Whole Hell Of A Lot More Than You To Clear Me Out, You Understand? Well, Not Only Am I Going To Clear You Out, I'm Going To Leave A Crater 6 Miles Long And 3 Miles Deep. Back Where I Come From, We Call That A Threat. Works For Me. [Blows Loudly] Y'all Don't Bother To Come On Back Now, You Hear? [Tires Screeching] Come On, He's Leaving. Come On, Let Me In. I'm Driving. No, You're Not. Ok, I'm Not. Mccall! And She's In Drive. Come On! Come On, Step On It. You Want To Compare Driving Records Now? Cut Him Off! Cut Him Off! I Can't Even Go Anywhere In This Junker. [Car Horn Honks] Hunter: He's Getting Away. Well, I Guess You Hit A Cone. What Are You Trying To Say? That It Was My Fault? Huh? It Was That Pile Of Scrap Metal You Drive Around In. It's Not The Fiddle. It's Who's Holding The Bow. Confucius 101. Why Don't You Just Come Right Out And Say It? You Think It's My Fault He Got Away. Just Say It. I Think It's Your Fault He Got Away. No, It Wasn't! It Was That Trash Heap You Call A Car. I Wouldn't Give You 10 Bucks For That Clunker If I Owed It To You. You Do Owe Me $10. No, I Don't. I Sprung For The Pizza, Remember? Hey, Feel Like Testing Your Luck On This Lock? [Sighs] No, Not Really. I'd Rather Find Something To Slam The Lid On This Guy That Won't Get Tossed Out Of Court. Hey, What Do You Say We Try Something Novel Like A Legal Way Into This Room? Fire Regulations? Officers, I Know Nothing From Any Fire Regulations. We're Lucky The Toilets Flush. This Should Have Been Caught A Long Time Ago. Between The Health Department And The Better Business Bureau, This Place Sees More Action Than Beirut. Well, The Point Is, Number 3 On The District Superintendent's Fire Safety Code Is Access To At Least One Fire Extinguisher For Every 12 Occupants. Now, This Is A Definite Infraction. As Far As I'm Concerned, They Can Shut The Dump Down. Give Me Some Time Off. I Suggest You See The Manager. Well, That Would Be A Real Pain In The Tush For All Of Us, But There You Go. Why Don't You Come Downtown, Give Us Your Statement? Downtown? Are You Kidding? Well, Maybe They're Next To The Staircase. Or Maybe A Couple Of Them Could Be In The Rooms. Why Don't We Have A Random Check? Like This Room, For Instance. Maid Service. I'll Check In The Closet. Yeah. Ah-Choo! Oh, Brother. Hay Fever. You Know, For A Guy Who's Not Interested In Women, He Circled 4 Places Here: All Meat Markets And Hooker Hangouts. I'll Hit The Street And See What I Can Turn. Yeah, I'll Try To Find Out Something On Panhandle Pete, And See If I Can Get Myself A New Car. A New Car, Right. [Music Playing] Hi, Baby. Sorry, Tex, I Don't Know Any Panhandle Pete, And I Don't Deal In Long Redheads, Do You Know What I Mean? It Doesn't Suit The Normal Taste Of My Clientele, Dig? Hey, Nobody Messes With Uptown Bill Brown! Hit The Trail, Tex. [Chuckles] And Don't Come Back, Cowboy! You Hear Me? I Was Kidding, Man. Hey, Ain't You Got No Sense Of Humor? I Got A Great Sense Of Humor. Matter Of Fact, Most Of The People I Meet, They Die Laughing. Understand? Unh! Oof! Hey, Hey, Wait A Minute. Hey, I Don't Have Any Redheads, Man, But I'm Sure I Know Somebody Who Does. I Do.

Yeah, Can You Hold On Just A Second? Hunter. [On Phone] It's Mccall. Yeah, Hold On Just A Second, Would You? Sheriff... No, It's Mccall. No, Hold On Just A Second. Sheriff, Hey, Listen, Thanks For Holding. I Appreciate The Information. It Helped A Great Deal. Yeah, Thanks A Lot. [Dial Tone] Mccall? Mcca-- [Ring] Mccall? Are You Nuts? Yes, I Am. What's Going On? This Guy Leaves A Wake Like A Runaway Torpedo. I've Been To 3 Different Places. They All Look Like They've Been Hit By A Hurricane. The Problem Is, Nobody Wants To Admit The Hurricane's Jimmy Joe. Well, Is This Guy After Anything In Particular? Or Is This Just A Hobby With This Guy? He's In The Market For A Long-Legged Redhead. There's One In Particular, But He Doesn't Have A Name. Uh, It Doesn't Make Sense For A Guy Who's Not Into Chicks. Hunter, Will You Give It A Rest? So I Was Wrong. No, No, No, You Weren't. Listen, I Just Got Off The Phone With A Sheriff Down In Alabama Who Knows This Guy Pretty Good, And You Were Right On The Money About This Guy. Chicks Isn't In His Vocabulary. This Guy's Running On Straight Ether. Well, Then, What The Heck Is He Doing Running Around Town, Kicking Over Joints, Looking For A Redhead? Well, When You Find Him, You'll Ask Him, Won't You? All Right, I'm Going To Head On Over To The Body Shop On Alameda. That Was Going To Be His Next Stop. I'll Meet You There. Ok. You Sure You Don't Want To File A Complaint? Does It Look Like I Want To File A Complaint? What? Is This A Joke? Nobody Saw Who Did This? Hunter: Well, Come On. Are You Kidding Me? You Think This Is The Last Place This Guy's Going To Stop? As Long As It's Not One Of His Future Ones. The Guy Who Didn't Do This, Any Idea Where He Was Going? Woman: Ginger. He Wanted To Find Ginger, And He Was Going To Look For Her Pimp. I Take It By Her Name She's A Redhead? He's Looking For A Redhead Who Tricks For A Guy Called Panhandle Pete. I Remember Her Saying His Name. Where? Where Can We Find Her? She Usually Works Out Of The Tickled Pink. Thanks. Man: Anyway, It Sounds Like Someone's Killing Her! No, I Don't Know Who It Is! Where Are They? What Room Are They In? I'm Trying To Call The Police. What Room? 204, Upstairs. [Woman Screams] [Woman Sobbing] Jimmy: What Is It This Time? How About Assault And Battery And Attempted Murder, You Pile Of Pig Slop? You Know, You're Out Of Your Holster A Little Too Soon, Hoss. You All Right, Ginger? Is Anything Broken? What, Is This Gratitude For You Or What, Huh? I Mean, Back Where I Come From, You Usually Get A Big "Yahoo!" For Coming To Rescue A Little Thing Like That. I Mean, She Almost Got Her Butt Kicked In. That Doesn't Wash Here, Pal, So Put It Back In Your Saddlebag. Look, I'm Being A Good Samaritan, Huh? Ain't Nobody In This Room Going To Tell You Different. Am I Right, Ginger? He Tried To Help Me. He Didn't Do Nothing. See? I Didn't Do Nothing. I Told You It Wasn't Him! It Was A Bad Trick. I Don't Know His Name. I Never Saw Him Before. He Just Ran Out. I Hope I Never See Him Again. Look, You Two Better Take Care Of The Little Lady. I Got To Get Going. What, And Play Good Samaritan To Panhandle Pete? [Chuckles] Hey, Honey... Listen, I'll Come Back And Check Up On You Before I Leave L.A. Make Sure You're Coming Along Ok. All Right. Mccall: Yeah, Desk? Police Emergency. I Need A Paramedic Up Here Right Now. Now, Ginger, You Told Him Something, Didn't You? Huh? You Told Him Where To Find Panhandle Pete? Oh, Please. It's Ok. You Had To Tell Him, But You Did Tell Him, Didn't You? I Was So Scared. I Know. I Know. Hunter...What Are You Going To Do? I'm Going To Stop This Guy. Well, What Do You Mean? How? I Don't Know. I'll Think Of Something. But He's Ahead Of Us On Laps And I Just Got To Flag Him Off The Track. [Sobbing] [Car Horn Honking] You Know, I'd Say You Need Driving Lessons, Hoss. You Know, Everybody's Been Telling Me That Lately. You Looking At Anything In Particular? I Noticed You Got A Back Seat. Well, What Did You Expect To Find? I've Got A Couple Of Friends That Were Bounty Hunters Once, And You Know What They Told Me? That If You Took Out The Back Seat Altogether, You Had More Room To Anchor The Shackles Down To The Floor. You Know, To Help Keep The Prisoners That You Picked Up From Giving You Trouble When You're Taking Them In. But Then Again, I Guess The People You Pick Up Don't Give You Much Trouble At All, Do They? What Do You Want? I Want You To Get Out Of The Car. What Did You Have In Mind, Rick? You've Been Leaving A Trail From Bar To Bar All Over This City, Jimmy Joe. Is That What People Saying About Me? Yep. You're A Real Fine, Upstanding Patron, You Are. You Come In, You Order Your Drinks, And Then You Move On. I Don't See Nothing Wrong With That. No, Neither Do I, As Long As You're Able To Walk That One, Single White Line Right There. What, Are You Kidding? What Line? Oh, Now, See, That's Bad. That's Real Bad. We're Going To Have To Give You A Motor Response Test. Why Don't You Shut Your Eyes And Extend Your Arms And See If You Can Touch Your Nose? You Know, I'm Getting The Feeling Like You're Trying To Square Dance With Me. I'm A Little Concerned Where Is This Leading. Downtown, So You Can Submit To A Blood-Alcohol Test. But Don't Worry, Before You Know It, You'll Be Free And Out Of Town Before Rush-Hour Traffic. You Know, You Must Single-Handedly Put A Damper On The Tourist Trade Of This Entire City. We Got Laws In This Burgh. I'm Just Trying To Keep The Streets Safe For Everybody. Who Knows? The Life You Save May Be Your Own. Ginger: It's My Life I'm Worried About, Sgt. Mccall. I'm Worried About You, Too, Ginger. I'm Also Worried About Who This Guy Walker Is After. If You Don't Help Me To Nail Jimmy Joe, There's A Real Good Chance He's Going To Come Back To You Or To The Other People He's Terrorized. The Only Way To Stop This Is For You To Help Me Put Him Away. I Can't. Look, You And I Both Know What Will Happen. You'll Arrest Him, He'll Go Before A Judge, And Either He'll Get Off On Bail Or He'll Be Set Free On His Own Recognizance. And Then What? I've Got No Place To Run To Or Hide. Look, Ginger... I Don't What To Say To You Except This Guy Is Going To Kill Somebody. He Knows That You And Hunter Know. He Wouldn't Try Anything. Look, I Don't Know What It Is That Spins This Guy's Windmill, But He Is Going For It. He Doesn't Give A Damn About Nothin' And Nobody. He's Going To Kill This Guy Panhandle Pete, And When He's Done, He's Going To Kill Somebody Else, And Then If He Feels Like It, He's Going To Kill Somebody Else. Ginger, I Don't Mean To Stand Here And To Yell At You After Everything You've Been Through, But You Are My Only Chance At Stopping Him. Now, Look, Ginger, I Promise I'll Do Everything-- I'll Do More Than Everything To Protect You. I Will Personally Baby-Sit You Day And Night Until He Is Convicted And Sent Away. I'll Move You In With Me. Ginger, You Have To Tell Me What You Told Him. You Just Have To. Panhandle Pete Was Friends With The Chief? Mccall: Yeah, Ginger Says Once Or Twice When She Was Working In The Bar That Pete Came In With A 7-Foot Indian. She Said Jimmy Joe Seemed To Know They Were Friends. Well, If They Both Came Into Los Angeles Together, That Means They're Probably Both From New Jersey. That's Where The Wanted Poster On The Chief Was From. I'll Run It By R.N.I., See What Tips Up. Ginger Says That He Was Staying At The Marquis Plaza, Bungalow 12 On Sunset Since Last Sunday, So I'll Go Over There And Check It Out. Marquis Plaza, Huh? That's A Pretty Swank Place For A Guy With The Name Panhandle Pete. Yeah, Well, I'll Point That Out To Him When I See Him. Hey, Listen, What About Our Alabama Baby? Any Chance Of Running Into Him? No, He's Off The Game Board. I Got Him Out Of Commission, At Least For A While. Drunk Driving? You Know, If You Think You're Going To Get Away With This Thing, Your Elevator's Not Going All The Way Up. Look, Captain, I Was Just Trying To Shut The Guy Down Legitimately. Legitimately? You Call This Beefed-Up Nonsense Legitimate? You Know, Hunter, There Are Actually Times When I Honestly Forget Why It Is I Don't Like You, And Then Boom! Just As Soon As That Happens, You Come Along And Ram It Right Up My Nose. We Can't Go Around Fabricating Charges Like This. It Wasn't A Fabrication, Captain, The Guy Had At Least 3 Drinks, Which Puts Him Over The Legal Blood-Alcohol Limit. Look, All I Wanted To Do With This Guy Is Get Him Off The Bricks Long Enough To Figure Out What His Game Was. And We Did. What's This? It's An Outstanding Warrant From The State Of New Jersey On A Peter Montane. He's A Long-Time Associate Of David Blackfoot's. The Chief? You Mean This Is What He's Been Hanging Around For? A $1,000 Reward Poster? Come On. Look, Captain, He Knows Mccall And I Are On Him. He's Not Hanging Around Town For A Measly 1,000 Bucks. He's Got Something Else Bigger In Mind... Something Like $113,000. The Amount Of Money In The Bank Holdup. Montane's Moniker Is Panhandle Pete, And How He Got That Was By Playing Lookout On Armed Robberies By Positioning Himself Outside The Places They Were Going To Hit. Out Of The Eyewitness Testimonies, Two Mention A Blind Guy Panhandling Out In Front Of The Bank The Day It Was Hit. Now, Panhandle Pete Was The Second Guy In That Bank Robbery, Captain. Jimmy Joe Figures He Probably Still Has The Money. He Was Going To Bag Him, Make Him Turn The Money Over To Him, And Probably Waste Him. Now, Mccall Has A Line On Panhandle Pete. What I Want To Do With Walker Is Keep Him Locked Up Until I Can Get Pete Into Custody. It's Not Possible. Why Not? Walker Was Released Just Before I Called You In Here. Mccall. Radio: Mccall, This Is Hunter. Do You Copy? Mccall? Mccall. You Crazy, Man? I'm A Cop. [Mccall Groans] My God! Are You All Right? That Scumball Took My Gun. Yeah, And As Soon As He Catches Up With Panhandle Pete, He's Going To Take The 110 Grand, Too, And Since He Took The Time To Pound On A Cop, Chances Are He's Going To Fill That Baby Blue Drop-Top Up And Point It Toward Mexico. I Think He Chipped A Tooth, Too. That Adds Character. I Really Think You Should Come Down And Get X-Rayed. Who Knows What's Going On Inside. I'm Fine. I'm Fine, Really. Thank You Anyway. You Did A Terrific Job. Don't Worry, I Won't Let Her Change Any Flats. Whoa... How Come On Ben Casey, They Always Used To Say, "It's Just A Concussion." Hunter: Well, Maybe You'd Better Go To The Hospital After All. Will You Lay Off, All Right? I'm Not Going To Any Hospital. You Guys Can Get Rid Of The Gurney. Ok? I'm Fine, Really. Feel Free To Spill All Over The Floor. All Right, I Didn't Mean To-- Wait A Minute, I Am Not In Any Condition To Have To Apologize To You. Hot News Flash! Looks Like Our Boy Panhandle Pete Envisions Himself Behind The Wheel Of A Brand-New Chrysler. Are You Sure That's Not Too Heavy For You? A Little Bit Of Humor There. Hunter, The Chief And Pete Pulled Off The Robbery, And Pete Made Off With The Money, Right? So? So The Chief's Sitting In A Furnished Armpit, And Pete's At The Marquis Plaza In A Suite. Think Maybe He's Starting To Spend His Share Of The Money? Prestige Motors? You Think? Is This Lady Bait Or What? The Double Plush Mats, Like I Promised. If I Could Afford A Car Like This, I'd Be Divorced In An Instant. Hang Tough, My Man, Maybe You Will Someday. I Wish. Let Me Get This Out Of Your Way, And You're Off. Rocco, Don't Miss Those Whitewalls. Look Out, Mamas... I'm Coming At You. Walker: Get Out. That's Right. That's Right. You A Cop? Heh. You Ain't That Lucky, Hoss. Now, We're Going To Go For A Little Walk, And You're Going To Act Like You're Loving It, Understand? Or You're Going To Make A Mess All Over Your Shiny Car. Move. Well, Don't Bother To Help Me. Ok, I Won't. Here. That's For You. Oh, I'm Touched. Really. What Are You Going To Use? Where Did You Get That? It Was A Graduation Gift From My Dad. All I Got Was A Brand-New Set Of Encyclopedias. Let's Go. Get In There. You Drive. Where? Where Are We Going? Wherever You Got The 100,000 Stashed. But I-- No, No. You Put The Pedal To The Metal, Or I'll Do You Right Here. You Understand? Drive. Excuse Me, I Called A Few Minutes Ago, And I Was Told That Pete Montane Was Going To Pick Up His New Car Sometime Today. Actually, He Was Picking It Up Just Two Minutes Ago. Where Did He Go? Ah! There He Is. Mr. Montane! Hold It, Jimmy Joe. Jimmy: Hit It! Get Down! Police Business. Thanks. Come On, Shake Them! [Gunshots] [Gunshots] Freeze! Spread Them Right Now! [Gunshot] [Gunshot] Hunter! [Music Playing] ♪ Tell Me What's Been Going On ♪ ♪ I Got This Sneaky Suspicion ♪ ♪ There's Somethin' Wrong ♪ ♪ There's Somethin' Wrong ♪ ♪ There's Somethin' Wrong ♪ You Dare... Actually Dare To Put In A Request For Another Vehicle After Arranging It With That Car Company So That We Have To Reimburse Them For Damages Done To Two--Count Them-- Two Luxury Sedans. You Got Some Sense Of Humor, Hunter. Hunter: And He Complimented Us On The Apprehension Of Panhandle Pete In Connection With The Bank Robbery And Locating The Missing $100,000. And Get This, He Was Hoping That You Would Feel Better And That Your Ribs Would Soon Mend. You Are A Terrible Liar. No, I'm Not. I'm A Great Liar. If He Was In Such A Great Mood And So Beholden To Us, Then Why Didn't You Hit Him Up For A Car? Now, You See, Mccall, I Wouldn't Do That. There's Simply No Reason To Ask For Another Car. We Don't Need Another Car. There's Nothing Wrong With This Car. There Was Nothing Wrong With The Other Car. Nothing That Couldn't Be Fixed By A Little Tune-Up. Or A Crusher. You See, Mccall, It's Not The Fiddle... It's Who's Playing It. [Backfire] You Think? [Laughs]
