 Dear Lord, after his sex tape leaked, Governor Love went down. In retaliation, the 18:20 dragged Margret's perfume factory down with him. While Margaret, petty as always, shut down Ginger's trollop site. With the Cyber Sluts out of a job, I expected Ginger to have some trick up her thong. And boy, did she deliver. Margaret Monreaux implicated in a bombshell report. What?

 Implicating Margaret, Townes, and exposing some weirdo I fear may know my brother. My brother is incapable of that. Question mark? I mean, his friends are seeming kind of hinky these days. Get in the car, Yopi. Margaret denied everything, natch, and paid off Ginger to absolve her in public. Neither Margaret nor I had any knowledge of what those men did to my mother. She looked so hot on camera. Not that I would know. I mean, we kissed once,

 but I assure you there was no tongue. It's still not as bad as whatever Eric is doing. Meanwhile, Ginger, turned millionaire, decided to invest in Rose's fashion line, but Rose took off to Colorado with the stoner again. I'm so glad to have met you. I'm pretty sure he's running a cartel by now. Wonder how many dead bodies he's hiding. Speaking of dead bodies, turns out Townes took the whole thing pretty hard and offed himself. Poor Veronica. Another 18:20 member goes down, Margaret gets her factory back, and is armed to spray her stinking stench into the world. Please help us all, dear Lord. In Jesus's name, amen. Townes had so many friends, and this is all that turns up? Well, I am here for you, Veronica. We are all here for you. You've just had a terrible shock. Now, you come out to the camp for as long as you want. I insist. Oh, I just want to bury all this nasty business along with Townes. It's best to not make any decisions right now. Let's just take care of you. - Right, Franklin? - Of course. Rest, and then take it easy. Thank you both. She's so fragile. It'll take time before she's back on her feet. There's no time to waste, Margaret. We got to stop the Reverend from trying to swoop in and buy Townes' shares if the Network. She wants to forget all about Townes Dockerty and we're gonna help her. "A gift for Eric. Thelma, Erika, Marilyn, Ophelia." Eric's whores. Guess the shame was too much for him. You okay? Do you ever think about killing yourself? What? Nothing. Right. Margaret, let's have our own party later. I'll bring my radio. Come on, we both know the dance. I cut the checks for the children. They'll be arriving soon. Margaret? Huh? Oh, yes. Thank you, Franklin. Now, you sure you want to do this? They're already pulling away. Why give them an ultimatum? It's not an ultimatum. It's their future. I want them to fully understand their choices. Yes? Which one of these women is sleeping with my Eric? Good morning. Nice to see you too. Tell me. This is a list of hurricanes, not women. You don't need some paranoid excuse every time you want to drop by. Good morning. A reporter? Seriously? Investigative journalist. This whole ceremonial gathering of the children thing seems like a silly waste of time, considering. Why can't she just mail us our checks? Why all the drama? It's just another one of Mama's little tests. It always has to be about her. Hey, where's Jason? His flight landed an hour ago. So, uh, he... he'll be here. Margaret's ready. Oh, finally. Thank you all for being here, again, and hearing me out. - Six million each. - As promised. If you sign, it will be the last Monreaux money that you ever see. But if you decline, you will be further invested in the Sunshine Network family. So I want you all to think this through, and don't sell yourself short. It's a no-brainer for me. Mama, I'm here to do the Lord's work through the missions, all right? And bring... bring glory back to the family name. Thank you, son. Antonio, I'm surprised. I thought you were fitting in so nicely. I can't discuss it now. Well, I'm taking the money. No surprise there. - Nope. - So is Rose. Is that right, Rose? We're launching my fashion line. Tonight, in fact. Our debut show will be at the Acadian Court Motel right after sundown. I hope y'all can make it. Sweetie, are you sure that you are ready? Well, I couldn't wait for you anymore, Mama. I'm sorry. Jason. - Are you okay? - No. My brother, Mark, he passed away. - What? - I'm so sorry to hear that. Is there anything at all that we can do? I'm just here for the money and then I'm taking off. Okay, can I talk to you for a second, please? Yeah. I'm so sorry about your brother. He was so full of life the last time I saw him. - It's... it's... - Awful, yeah. Look, you can still be Mark. We don't have to lie anymore. Let me tell you about Mark. Not only is that guy broke, but his family's in debt. He just got blackmailed by his two best friends. He could go to jail for impersonating his brother. He's not related to anybody rich or important. He's just the same loser he always was. So, tell me, why would anybody choose to be Mark? Because Mark has me. Why doesn't that matter to you anymore? I'm not a rich kid. Okay, I just can't take cash from a secret hole in the wall every time there's a problem. We need the money. What happened in Colorado? Tell me. People die, Rose. Nothing's stopping us. Do you want to be with me? So now you want to be with me... now? Margaret has a wonderful offer to buy your shares in the Sunshine Network. I think you should consider. Oh, so you're just here to pick the bones clean? You know, I thought she'd try this, but I didn't think you'd agree so easily. She got you wrapped around her little finger. - Excuse me? - Oh, she's cold-blooded. She uses everyone, including you. Our interests are aligned, Veronica. Oh, Franklin. You're her lackey. A man like you, I think it's sad. - Watch your words, here. - I don't care anymore. I'm telling the truth and you know it. You selling or not? Not. Okay, I'm gonna say it. You should not feel embarrassed. Sibling fantasies are a huge part of my online cam business. Any combination you could imagine. - It's natural. - No, no. I do not want to imagine that. Genetic sexual attraction, that's the scientific term for it. It happens most often when siblings reunite. They call it missed bonding, or in these parts of the world, Saturday night. Okay, well, that is not what is going on with Jason and me. - I swear it. - I'm not judging. Just get it off your chest. You promise you won't say anything to anyone, like, ever? We're sisters. Now spill. Veronica, please stay! Don't run off. Oh, drop the act, Margaret. - I see what you're up to. - What? My only satisfaction is knowing that you're not getting what you want either. I don't follow. I'm sure Franklin can explain it. - You didn't get her shares. - Nope. And she didn't get you. - Is that it? - Margaret, let it be. She says I'm a fool to stick by you. Veronica! Can I get a ride to town? We are partners and she knows that. Besides, looks like she's already moved on. Margaret, she's his mother. Ah, those are for the party. You better save us a tray, then. We need the full Cotillion experience. Oh, I need a dress for that. - Margaret? - Hmm? Oh. Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you. So what can I do you for, sweetie? Well, I, um, I heard from my mom, and, um, I gotta head back to town. Oh. But I don't want you to think I'm being disloyal. There's just some things I need to handle. My mom and I, we cooked here in this very kitchen. And we knew what it was to just scrape by. I don't want that for you or Jesus. You promise me that you won't give it all to Yopi. You let Franklin put that money into an account that only you can access. I need to speak to my mom first. You just remember it's Jesus' future too. It looks great, but I'm actually training for a fight. Okay. Well, more for me. Thank you, Margaret. You come home soon. I will. You are the only child who didn't desert me, Eric, and that kind of loyalty must be rewarded. I'm making you CEO. Yes, I am. - No way! - Mm-hmm. - CEO? - Yeah, have a seat! In Daddy's chair? Yeah, Daddy's chair. Oh, my... Wow. Wow. - CEO. - Mm-hmm. So what are you? Well, I guess that makes me, uh, chairwoman. I need you to take Eugene's place with the 18:20. I want you to be my eyes and my ears. Make sure that they never pull another stunt like they did with Ginger. Well, as bad as that was, Mama... I'm afraid that's just the tip of the iceberg. I expect I should probably sit down? Yeah, probably. Managed to not fornicate with anyone on your way to the kitchen? That's actually none of your business. You kissed me. No, you kissed me. Right. I just got confused seeing you with a man, that's all. A person doesn't have to be just one thing, Becky. I am attracted to individuals, men and women. And I let myself act on those impulses. I don't hold back. But you are married to my brother. So if you want to kiss me again, you might want to take that into consideration just for your own well-being. Right. I'm so trapped. Life shouldn't be about surrender. It should be about freedom. There are no rules. Only consequences. Hey, we gotta start packing for the show. Yeah. Do you want to come spend the day with us? We need all the hands we can get, and a day with the girls might be good for you. - Okay. - Okay. Every time I right one of Eugene's wrongs, there's a bigger one waiting for me right around the corner. The Reverend made you install me because he thought I'd never tell you about the graft at the missions. We got rich by intentionally building homes for the poor that were meant to fail. This problem is so much bigger than you and me, Mama. Until I can come up with a plan, let's keep this between us. Mama, I'm afraid I'm gonna disappoint you. How could you ever do that, son? If I end up like Dad. Not just as a CEO... But as a man too. Are there... women outside your marriage? I'm trying to fight it. I am. But what if it's... what if it's in my DNA? You were born of my DNA as well, and we are dedicated to church and family, to decency, and a commitment to true Christian values. The Lord's guidance, it leads us not into temptation. It protects us from ourselves. We must heed His word. Yes, Mama. You're about to have a child, Eric. You can be a better man than your father ever was. We can let it dry and do it again one more time. Thank you, man. Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow... Hey, Ma. Ma, Ma, Ma. My boy won't get punched in the face for a living. - Okay, we talked about this. - Relajarse! - No, we talked about this, Ma. - We're just playing! - Come on! - Where the hell have you been? It's not where I've been, it's where you're going. Get your gym bag. Get your mind ready for war, baby, 'cause you're about to get your shot. - Uh-oh. - Uh-oh is right! Are you serious? - Uh-oh is right! - What? Hey. Where you going? You coming home? I thought we could spend some time together. No, I'm helping at the fashion show. Oh, I don't think that's a good idea. That motel is not a good place for... For a good Christian woman. Yeah, or a good Christian man. Besides, you'll be in your bunker, with your laptop. Oh, well, look at this! Don't I at least get a little peek? Sure. Oh! Oh. - Oh. - You don't like it. It's hard to put yourself out there. People can be vicious. Well, the models can take it. Your girls? They needed the work, thanks to you. Sex workers at a sleazy motel? Oh, sweetie, I think that's sending the wrong message. Remember, you're a Monreaux. They'll already be gunning for you. We're looking for a reaction. Love or hate, that's what sells. You're the one who taught me that, Margaret. Well, this isn't about you, Ginger. Sweetie, do you remember when... When you had that lead in the school play, and you forgot all your lines? Now, this is gonna feel just like that except a whole lot worse. You know, I remember you sitting in the front row judging every move that I made. No! No. - Are you gonna come tonight? - You know I will. Okay. Come on. - Good luck. - Thank you. There will be a point where she'll try and back out. Don't let her. Everything came so easy to my brother. He had perfect pitch, he aced his tests. He knew how to make people feel good, you know? He would say the right things at the right time. Knew when to shut up too. Something yours truly never learned. He was special. He couldn't take being less. Couldn't live with it. It's what he wanted. Death. Peace. Heaven. He didn't want to be trapped on this earth anymore. - It wasn't my fault. - Of course it wasn't. You don't understand. Maybe I don't, but I know someone who will. You need a man of God, a healer. Can I take you to him? Yeah, I'm gonna take you to him. Franklin! Is anyone there? Margaret? Margaret! All right, look at the birdie. Say cheese. Beautiful. Margaret! Get in here, girl! Eugene hasn't come down yet. I want you to take him this tray. - To his room? - Yes, to his room. He needs to see you before any of these other girls. You want to be stuck in the kitchen your whole life like your mother? Don't you dare get shy on me. Margaret, let me do that. I can't. She started a war she can't win. Why should you be collateral damage? If you haven't noticed, Margaret and I are faring well in your little war. You're the ones dropping like flies. We both know there would be no network without you, Franklin. Does she know that? A... Are you trying to recruit me? We've long admired your skills. You can name your price. Good Christian men, we all have to stand together. I'm Baptist, and you damn sure ain't a Christian. So no matter what I choose, it won't be you. Eugene? Ah, bring it over. Ah, yes. You read my mind. Here you go. I shouldn't. Come on. Don't make me drink alone. Okay. Then why don't I want to leave this room? What is it, Franklin? Time to go. Shouldn't you be in the kitchen? We both should. To be continued. Who's wearing the red mini? Which one of you is wearing the red miniskirt? I think it's me. Uh, just, everyone is touching everything. - Rose? - Uh-huh? Your clothes are actually going to be worn. - Deal with it. - Uh-huh. Oh, do we get to keep these? - Uh... - No. No. That's not how it works, but I am paying you supermodel rates. 10k for the day. Each? Consider it SaintWagon severance pay. This is about sisterhood, Becky, not suspicion. Now stop it or I'm gonna have to send you home. Which one is seeing Eric? I promise I won't make a scene. I'm just curious. Oh, oh, oh, that... That's the wedding dress. So that's gonna be the final look of the show. Whoever's the best model should wear that one. Rachel, would you do the honors? Okay. Oh, my gosh! Oh, my... You want to meet him? Here he is. Yo, man! Whoo! Jesus was a carpenter, a muscular man, a warrior. Like all champions, when they knocked Him down, He rose. He conquered. Will he be a solider for God? I don't care if he's a soldier for Bozo the Clown as long as he's making big-money fights. Have you told him we want you to throw the first fight? Not yet. One thing at a time. Made that! Beautiful! Margaret, what the hell? Oh, well, it appears I fell. Should I call a doctor? I had to scuttle my butt over here, and dipped into Eugene's best whiskey. Oh, oh! I got you, I got you. I think it's done the trick. Oh! Oh, Franklin. I've been lying here thinking about us when we were kids in this old house. Oh, that was hard, wasn't it? Mm, you okay? Oh, we've come such a long way. - Yeah. - Well, you have. What the hell does that mean? I'm a wealthy man, but still I feel like a servant here. You are everything to me. Fleecing a widow when her husband is still warm in the ground. Now, we got a lot of history, but that's the first time that I've ever felt dirty. I can't keep doing this. So what are you saying? You have to have trust for a partnership to work. - Trust? - Mm-hmm. Like how you handled all of Eugene's baby mamas behind my back. I guess, uh, that didn't make you feel dirty. I was just trying to protect you. Oh, by protecting Eugene over and over and over. You are right. You are right. I made those choices. Do you regret them enough to leave? Maybe. I feel like our whole world is about to fall apart. I don't want to face that alone. Okay, Margaret, what's going on? Come on, baby. Come on. Yes, get the best seat in the house. - Come on, baby. - Yeah! Hey, Marcus, can I borrow that? - Yep. - Okay. Okay, as soon as that goes live, I want it projected up there. - Got it? - Yeah, sure thing. - Thank you. - Mm-hmm. There is no way I'm fixing a fight. What about my code? My... my... my dignity? It's a planned trilogy! Don't you get it? You lose the first fight, okay. The second fight, you win. And then you fight fair in the third, and everybody gets rich off of the action. It's a win-win-win! I got Margaret's money! I don't need to compromise myself. Six million? Six million? - That's nothing! - Oh, it's nothing? Yeah, you give me the check, I'll turn it into 50. What about the fortune I made you, huh? What are you talking about? Don Bouchard said "I made you a fortune back in the day." You want to talk about that? Let's talk about it. Tell me the truth for once right now. - Tell me the truth! - You want to talk about it? - Yes, I want to know! - You want to talk about it? Yes, I want to know! I'll tell you all about it. When I got pregnant with Eugene's baby, they gave me money, to get an abortion and disappear. A million bucks. But I could feel that something special... Was growing inside of me. Un guerrero. And I couldn't go through with it. So, when they found out I had you... They took my money, and they held me down, and they broke my hands so I couldn't ever fight again. - I'm gonna kill them. - No! You're not gonna kill 'em! That's why I never told you anything, because I know you'd go crazy. Shut the door! What do you expect me to feel? That it was all worth it. You are everything I hoped for. Tu eres mi vida. Mi bendición. And I thank God every day for you. Yes, right this way! Whoo! Come on. Right here! Here's the line! Ooh, baby's kicking. Mm. Do you want to feel it? Uh... Here. It's all right. - Okay. - Uh... here. Oh, wow. It's amazing, right? It's you, isn't it? You're the one who's been sleeping with Eric. Becky, I'm so sorry. I never actually thought about you as a person. I haven't thought of me as an actual person either. I know we're supposed to have a big catfight right now or something, but my feet are swollen, so I can't really kick. Rachel, it's not your fault. It's not. My husband doesn't see me. But if I'm being honest, I kind of like it that way, so. Maybe there is a way for everyone to see you, Becky. That son of a bitch. And if it becomes public, we will be vulnerable again. We will fix this together, like we always do. We've had so much invested in each other for so long. Franklin, Rose's show. Oh, I said I'd be there. No, don't go, Margaret. Let it be. - She needs me! - Let it be. What? Do you think I'm being overprotective? I think you treat your children like employees. No. You bribe them to keep them close, and then you try to control their every move. You are smothering them. Look, birds, they push their babies out of the nest. Let them to learn how to fly on their own. But what if they fall? You didn't, and your mama threw you to the wolves. Welcome, welcome! Are you coming in? I don't see a ring on your finger. Come on. You're single, you're single. I got girls. Come on. Don't you worry. Don't be shy. Come on. You can do it. Let's go, let's go, let's go! Whoo! Yes, baby. Yes. Come on. Rose! This is your show! Yeah, hi. Come on, Rose! Shake it baby, yes! Yeah, shake it! He has risen, and is surrounded by sin. I will save him. Reverend Paul? Okay, he might seem cheesy, but that man's got God on speed dial. Open your heart, clear your mind, and just let him... Let him lift you up. And if you like it, it's yours. Well, 32% of it. - What? - My Sunshine Network shares. They're yours. And that's just the beginning. I want to give you the whole world, baby. I'm just sorry it's taken so long. You just met me. It doesn't feel like that. I was born with diamonds, but all I ever wanted was to know my son, my only child, and here you are. You're my mother? Ladies and gentlemen, live from New Orleans, this is The Word, with your host Reverend Paul Thomas. How are we feeling today, everybody? I want you to put your hands up in the air today because we all feel alive with the Lord. And if you feel alive with the Lord, I want you to say, "Hallelujah." Hallelujah! - Hey. - Hey. Have you seen Mama? I don't think she's here yet. I don't know, but maybe she just, like, got caught up in something and forgot to leave a message. Margaret's told you who she is a thousand times. Believe her. Jason isn't here either. But I am. And so are they. Doesn't that count for anything? This looks so nice. I don't think that I can watch the show. I'll... I'll spoil everything somehow. Mama always said that it's... I don't give a rat's ass what Margaret always said. Think about your dad. Our dad. He believed in you. Reward that faith by standing up for your work. Armoire du Rose. This is your night. Do you think Daddy's watching? He wouldn't miss this. You're gonna make him so proud. Oh, my God. All right! If you can feel the Lord alive in you today, I want you to put your hands together! Everybody here and everybody at home, let's feel alive! This is incredible! Brother Tom, you got a problem with your eyes, don't you? Brother Tom, I want you to close your eyes. Can you see the darkness? The eyes are the lamp of the soul. When the eyes are healed, the body is healed. The body and the eyes will be healed, and the body will see the light of the Lord. Open your eyes and see the vision of the Lord! Hallelujah, Brother Tom! Reverend Paul! This is my son, my only heir. He needs to be healed. "When I looked upon Him, "I fell at His feet like a dead man, "and He put His right hand on me. "And He said, 'Do not be afraid, for I am the first and I am the last.'" God bless you, son. Oh, my gosh, that's... That's Jason, that's Jason. Yeah. Hey, focus on the show. - Okay. - Focus on the show. Yes. We have to go. We have to go. Let's go. The woman clothed with the sun with the moon under her feet, and on her head a garland of 12 stars. She's carrying the Beast. Doesn't she look amazing? Yes. That's my wife. She's gonna have our baby. I don't know what I'm doing. I have no clue what the hell I'm... I... we have to stop... Rachel. I still can't cut you loose. It's not your decision, Rachel. Eric, you two aren't meant for each other. I can feel it in my heart, Eric. You look beautiful. My goodness. My girls. So much braver than their father. Mr. Monreaux. Mr. Monreaux. Eric! Eric, you're the head of Sunny Missions. I'd love for you to... You've been harassing my family for months. If you don't leave us alone, I'm gonna take out a restraining order. I want to testify. It is the Lord's will. You're supposed to be dead. Shh. Shh, shh, shh. "Half sacred, half profane, Rose Monreaux's fashion show was a revelation." "The birth of the modern Christian woman." - Amen. - Amen. I-I cannot believe we pulled this off. Thank you. Whoo! So you did for pregnancy what Madonna did for moles. I don't want to go home. Let's get you out of this dress. Set me free. Rose! Oh, I was worried. How did it go? Well, today was the best and worst day of my life, and you weren't there for either, so you don't have a right to ask me that. Actually, do you remember that school play? I was word-perfect in the dress rehearsal when you weren't there. But that night, when the curtain went up, I was humiliated. I'm the problem? I don't think you will be anymore. I'm gonna sign that check, and I'm going into business with Ginger. I don't know, maybe it's time I move out too. Out of your shadow and into my light. Fly, my little bird, fly. God sees all. If you confess, you can be forgiven. Isn't that what you want? It was my brother. He was in so much pain. He asked me to do it. He asked you to what now? You have to say it. Send him back to heaven. You took your brother's life? I didn't want to. Heavenly Father, Brother Jason comes before you today, bowed and humbled by his sins. We know the wages of sin is death, and though we deserve it not, that death has already been died by your Son, Jesus Christ. And so, undeserving as he is, we ask that you let Jason confess his sins, so that they, too, may die on the cross, so that he may be forgiven! Washed clean by the blood of the Lamb. Take a deep breath now, Jason, and breathe in the Lord's forgiveness. Now, everyone can leave, but not you. You promise? I promise. Margaret? What are we to each other, really? You know that answer. Everything. We do this, it changes everything. I hope so. OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
