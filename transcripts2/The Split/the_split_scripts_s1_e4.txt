 I think I might've dropped my engagement ring here today. Oh, thank you! Oh, my God. The transfers to this account go back about ten years. For your son. He is yours, isn't he? Yeah. So, she brought the man-child. It's like being burgled when we're still home. Night. Not now. Then when? That night before my wedding, we... Slept together?

 Ow! You're on my side! It's controversial, but he's OK. I like you, Nina. Don't be weird! I am the go-to booty call. Bye. I want my share of Defoe's. I want to sell. Nothing. For 30 years. We wrote. No... He left you. He didn't leave us. Hello? Yes. I'm... I'm awake. Yep. Yeah, I know Mrs Graham. Erm, yeah, we did.

 Yes, when I was at Defoe's. Nope. No, who's Indiana Ray? Ramsey Sawyer, Director of Communications for the Government. I'm looking after Mrs Graham. We got the heads-up, thanks to intelligence, that the Indiana Ray site has been hacked. The leaked client list will go online at 7am, which slightly blows their tag line as the place to go for the discreet extramarital affair. Mr Graham is on the list, and we have the Chinese President and his wife arriving for a high-profile state visit later today. As Foreign Secretary, Mrs Graham will be hosting. This will hijack the entire trip. PM's looking for damage limitation. Mrs Graham, however, has other ideas. Mrs Graham, Hannah Stern. We met briefly when I was at Defoe's. Bill. Mr Graham. Yes. Darling, what are you doing up? Go back to bed. Dad's with me. We'll explain when we're home. No, Nana's there. Yeah. He's here. Yeah. All right, little man. No, don't wake Tommy and Gabe - let them sleep. We'll be home soon. You all right, darling? Would you like a diazepam? No, I want a bloody divorce! We do need to get some kind of statement out. The press will be scrabbling for copy as soon as the list goes online. It's a blanket statement, just something to keep them at bay while we... you decide on your next move. "Respect our privacy whilst we rebuild our marriage." I won't say "rebuild". How about "review"? Yeah. Good. Review. "Review" is a little open ended. Well, I thought I was being generous. It was a few meetings. Meetings?! Emma, please, can we talk about this later? How many times? The same woman? Different women? A number of women. I met one in particular several times. It was a connection. I'm sorry. I am so sorry. Did she spank you, or did you spank her? I will contest it, Emma. If you ask for a divorce, I will contest it. We are a family. Whatever you think of my behaviour, and I'm not proud of it, think of our boys. We are a family. You didn't think of family when you went on that site. If I could speak to Mrs Graham? Alone, please. The PM wants to see you in half an hour. Oh, I bet she bloody does. I haven't even brushed my teeth. He used his own name, for Christ's sake. First rule of security, if you're staying in a hotel, if you're booking a car, use a different name. It's basic. Mrs Graham, I'm curious. I no longer work with Defoe's. You usually use my mother. Now I want to use you. OK. So, let me talk you through what that might look like. Mm-hm. Divorce is a process of redrawing all the boundaries. Emotionally. Psychologically. Economically. I've heard it described as open-heart surgery whilst you're still awake, with no reassurances that everything will be put back in the right place. I am not saying this to alarm you, but I want you to be clear. Leaving any marriage is frightening. You've built a life around a person, and when that breaks down... I'm not frightened of leaving. It's staying that I can't stomach any more. It's the lies. I mean, who the hell is Indiana Ray, anyway? Pull in Nigel. Ask Ann and Michael to set up calls. I'm just coming in. Tell Nina! Not in yet or picking up her phone. I've tried her flat and left four messages. Do you want me to try again? Yes. Clear my diary for the morning. I want the entire building ready and online. Bill Graham's on the list. Put in a call. Already have. Emma's gone with Hannah. Don't! It's off! I'm on my way. You're still angry with me. Why would I be angry with you? Rose, please... Don't! OK. I'm stepping away from the milk. See you later. My parents are looking forward to tomorrow. They asked if there was anything they could bring. At the supper? After the church? You finally get to meet? I didn't forget. You forgot. Rose? We had a father who wanted to see us. And if you say you did it for us... I'm... Bye. Shit. The extramarital dating site Indiana Ray has been hacked. 50,000 client names have been released online, including the husband of the Foreign Secretary. As Mrs Graham is hosting the Chinese President and his wife on their high-profile state visit later today, this news could not have come at a worse time for the Government. Hey. Hey. So, how many names are we talking about? 50,000 leaked one hour ago online. The possible threat of another 50,000 over the next 48 hours. Some far-right Christian group trying to bring the site down. Martin Charleston? What THE Martin Charleston? First out of the gate. The press have started to pick up on names. The paps are just swarming downstairs. David Tyle. Sir Ron Massey. We did his last prenup. Lucky for him. Tell clients we can talk to them on Skype. JJ Johnson called in their lawyers at 5am. Find out how they got the heads-up. Next list comes in, I want first pick. Any interesting calls come in yet? Erm, actually...Emma Graham. As in the Right Honourable Emma Graham? I got the call at 4am. She wants a divorce. He's threatening to contest it. Brilliant. Double the hours in court. This could run and run. A letter of engagement? On its way back. And signed. Your mother's going to be... Yes, she is. Press statement's in. "Foreign Secretary reviews marriage in wake of Indiana Ray leak". And the moral of the tale is...? The best affairs are the ones you never had. OK. OK. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Divorce D-Day! Any plans tonight - cancel. Over to you. Jason. Martin, there you go. Becca. If you can distribute these. OK, guys, we're breaking the list down into blocks of 500. Johnny T, Johnny A - I'm putting you both on Ryder Nelson. Call just came in. I know, I know, he's a nightmare but he pays upfront. Maggie, Sean, we've got a number of calls from new clients. Please follow up on those, yeah? And the rest, any names you recognise, ring and call, OK? Two days of the year when none of you sleep - first working Monday in January, and September, when the kids have gone back. And now a third, forever to be remembered as Indiana Ray Day. And, guys, please be discreet, OK? Throughout the day, we will undoubtedly be dealing with high-profile clients. Press are downstairs and they're showing no signs of moving, so use the goods lift if needs be. Get bidding, comrades. Go, go, go! Nina! NINA! You're late. I've worked every day of every week, including evenings and weekends, since Hannah left. And for this you want a marching band and Donna on the kazoo? No. Not there! Not there! Amy, why don't you find something else to do, while I get her back in her cage? Cut the wisecracks in front of my staff. Davey McKenzie. There's still paperwork missing. Go through it with Lola. Pull the accounts. You might be working late. The FDR's not until... Look, just do it, Nina. Please! We cannot afford to lose Mr McKenzie. Incidentally, can you put in a call to Mr Pope? Remind him that he still hasn't paid. Sure. Anything else? Oh, I don't know. How about this cheque Dad sent? Do you think it'll still clear? So, are we going to buy him out? Nina... I'm actually not even talking to you. For God's sake! I understand that you are all upset, that there is a conversation to be had. Yes, you are correct. My intention is to buy your father out. However, this is a business and another working day, so can we please save this for later and make hay while the sun shines? Because if you hadn't noticed, everyone is... Yes, I know. ...everyone is... Everyone is divorcing. Today. Thank you. Thank you. OK, so I've been looking through more of the McKenzie accounts. Notwithstanding the £18 million which has been syphoned through the Daniel Duchy account... That's a lot of loose change for a ten-year-old. Isn't it? Mmm. There's still another £9 million unaccounted for. Interesting. As company secretary, doesn't Goldie have the right to attend company meetings? There's a gathering of the McKenzie board today. Call her. Hannah. Mother. I had a lunch nearby. Have you five minutes? My office is this way. Emma Graham. She's my client. First rule - all bets are off until the letter of engagement is signed. Shall we sit down or shall we stand? Putting aside the obvious conversation that we need to have... Mmm, that you lied to us? That we had a father who wanted to see us? Forever three against one. You need to buy him out. I'll certainly bear that in mind. It is in hand, Hannah. Well, putting all that aside for a moment, Emma and Bill Graham, they have been married for 27 years. They have three adorable boys. The youngest is still in primary school. I can't talk about ongoing cases. I appreciate that this must be a highly original feeling for you, taking one of my clients, but let me bring you up to speed. She can't divorce. No, she can, and she is going to. You really want to break that family up? What, better to live a lie? I don't see it as a lie. I see it as an economy with the truth. And your grandfather was partial to the odd bit of spanking, apparently. That's way too much information. How do you even know? Of course, you know everything. As ever, this has been an enlightening meeting, but I have a very busy day. Talking of spanking and all other things, Defoe's helped take out a privacy injunction for the Grahams against a national newspaper five years ago. One of their journalists was about to break a story that Bill had visited a hotel with a mature lady and several pieces of kit. And you did what? These were two mutually consenting adults engaging in... Wh-Which journalist? Matthew Royston. He's a piranha. Well, to avoid any details of that indiscretion coming out, Emma signed a witness statement stating that Bill had in fact spent the entire weekend with her. Oh, God... No. No. Yes. So, if this goes to court, these details may come to light... You perverted the course of justice. ...and they will come after Emma. And you. How could you do this? How... How could you be so stupid? I was trying to help a client save her marriage. Not to mention the fact you could be struck off. Your first duty is always to the court. Oh, thank you, a fact that had escaped my attention. Oh, really, Mother? You choose sarcasm now? Zander. Twice in one month. Don't you get vertigo? Being up this high? Oddly, no. I'll see you at the church tomorrow. There's a meeting of the tribes. You will be on time? Yes, yep. It's a wonderful thing about Hannah. You can always rely on her to do the right thing. Goldie! You still here, Bobby? They'll have to wheel me out. Ain't seen you in ages. Mum, what...? Board meeting. It's all right, love, I know where it is. Mum, please... I know you're angry, you have a right to be, but this isn't the place. Breathe, Michael. Don't make a scene. Mum, don't. Mum. Overall, we're looking... ...at a flotation figure of 148 million, with a healthy shareholders' net profit of close to 42p in every pound. And you can substantiate that figure? If you'd like to, erm, look at your shareholders' report, erm, page... ...page 12... Can I...? ...I can talk you through the exact figures. What the hell are you playing at? As company secretary, it's important I keep abreast of... You see, a man who can lie about a child... What else are you lying about? You're sleepwalking, love. Well, I'm awake now. And I'm on to you, Davey. See you in court. You go down that road, it won't just be me you're hurting. God... Hey. Hey. That 4am start kicking in? Yeah. Yeah. Oh. It's... And the West Coast just woke up. Emma Graham. They've been together a long time. And...? Well, I didn't, um...you know, fully walk her through the consequences. We're talking about a high-profile divorce. Which we do all the time. We're not...money whores. We're not press hungry. We're not like those other firms. Yes, we are. Sometimes. Often. Mainly Zander. She wants a divorce. Or she just thinks she wants a divorce. It came as a shock, it was left of field. She's under acute pressure. And you've been up since 4am. You're tired. I'm going to...advise her to just hold off. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, wait. It's a long marriage. It has its stresses and strains. At some point, both or one wants to get out. But they don't. They stay. Why? Uh... F-For the children or...or for, um, financial reasons. Because it's expensive. We make it expensive. Yeah. She has a career, a reputation. A-A-And maybe it still works sometimes. In all its dysfunction, maybe sometimes they're happy. Or maybe they're just too terrified to leave. So they stay. And maybe sometimes, maybe forever, they are thinking - no, wishing - that they were with someone else. Is that really what you want for her? That's... What's going on? The Grahams took out a privacy injunction on a newspaper five years ago. In that injunction, Emma lied to protect Bill. And my mother helped them do it. Oh, shit. I shouldn't have told you. Yes, you should have. OK. OK, which newspaper? Matthew Royston. The Mail. I did his last divorce. I'll call him. I don't want you involved. Too bad. You may need to advise her to stay. You don't need to do this. You sit tight tonight. Do nothing. I'll see what I can do. Thank you. I owe you. Yeah. I'll make you pay. You know tomorrow? I don't want children. Not now, no. But we agreed... Ever. ...in a few years. I don't want children ever. I mean, there are too many children in the world. Like, there are a lot. Billions. Like, why add to them? Kids are the things that bind you. No. Not always. There can be other things. You're spinning out. I need to get off. Rose! Rose. Rose! Sorry. In China there's this, erm, place where... ...where women never marry, they just have men dropped through a hole in their bedroom on a kind of fish hook. OK, you're losing me now. Stop thinking about forever. We're getting married until we don't want to be married any more, and then we won't be married. If it's horrible, then we get out. OK, let's just... let's just live together. I don't know why. It means something to me. Being married to you... ...you know, it matters to me. I still don't want children. So I'll have to have them with my next wife. Liv. Mum... I'm gonna kill him. Erm? Never grow up. Impossible. She's upstairs. It's the worst. I can't say anything to make it feel better right now. Except you're...beautiful. And clever, special. And he will kick himself. And when it stops feeling bad, then you'll feel better. And one day you'll meet someone else and... And he'll screw me over again. Or he'll be the one that makes sense of everything. Who sees who you are. Who you really are. Like you and Dad? Yeah. Like me and Dad. Nice. He can't even spell. Rex? Finally, she calls. Well, needs must. Your payment's late, Mr Pope. It worked, then? Rex Pope. May need to charge you interest. Hang on. Night! Goodnight. ...A couple of punch lines over there, so... He breaks up with her by text? Hmm. Maybe it's a good thing. Maybe she gets her heartbreak... ...now rather than later. You know, they call it a crush for a reason. You're heartless. We more than anyone need to be busting the myth of "the one". We need to say there are a million ones. Infinite ones. But instead, we fall into this... ...this Victorian archaic concept called marriage, which, quite frankly... Too many words. ...quite frankly, it was designed for a time when we all died by 40. Or we make a choice. We choose. Like I chose you. You smell of wine. Look at today. Here's to Indiana Ray. Do they know how many more names will be released? Another 50,000 tomorrow. Who knows after that? Some bishop blew his brains out in Glasgow. Ohh. Hannah... It's, uh... Turn it off. Mm-hm. Is that E.T.? What? That? What? No. E.T., phone home! Shut up! E.T., phone home! Right, you lot, hurry up. Last one out's...a biscuit. Biscuits? There's your coats. Got your noses? Got your...? iPad! I'll need one hour with the Foreign Secretary, and her husband has to be there, too. All questions... To be pre-agreed? Forget it. Matthew, come on. You're being given exclusive access to a serving Foreign Secretary who will, on record, discuss her husband's liaisons on an illicit website. In return, we will need to be assured that the nature of those liaisons are not disclosed. Come on. You get the exclusive, Matthew. It shuts the story down for any of your rivals and you'll get the headline of the year. If she's going to do this interview, it needs to happen today. Agreed. And there will be no mention of any past indiscretions? No, the past is another country. I won't go easy on them. They've got children. And you're a good dad, Matthew. Yeah! Tell that to my ex-wife. We'll be in touch. OK, thanks, Christie. I didn't fully walk you through what your divorce will look like. You will stand up in an open court if your husband contests it, and your life will be put on display, every detail designed to shame you. The press will be waiting, capturing your every move, ready to annihilate you and your family. Every detail of every relationship he has ever had will be exposed. Including those you may have tried to hide. You may not want to, but you will implicate yourself and others. It will end your career. Hannah... You lied to me by omission. But worse, you lied on a sworn document. Do you know what that means? Yes. Then how did you think you could divorce and not expect that to find you? Now. In the eye of the storm. I'm a politician. I'm always in the eye of the storm. Noble and Hale have set up a high-profile interview, where you will be able to control your side of the narrative, before this story and your life becomes fair game for every tabloid out there. Hannah... It is the only way you will be able to protect your children from worse, and come out with some semblance of dignity. Mmm. The lies you tell yourself. The small ones... He's tired, you've had a long day, you'll catch up at the weekend. And then the weekend never happens, and the weeks turn into months, years... ...until you roll over, close your eyes, hope it will go away. Well, it's always there. Why me? Why did you come to me? Your mother. She said to me, if I was to ever choose to divorce, then I was to go to you. And you'd do the right thing. She said you always did. Oh... Huh. What, she just woke up this morning and decided to stay with him? Yes. What are you not telling me? In case you need reminding, you work for Noble and Hale. Zander, she's not gone back to Defoe's. Politicians. You can never trust them. Well... Uh, it's... Yeah. New list? Come on, hand over. No, it's not officially out until 7am tomorrow morning. That's impressive. JJ Johnson? Won't get it for another five hours. What? We got Mr Royston an amazing interview. Quid pro quo. Let's... Uh-uh-uh. My assistant's just printing out more. I'll make sure there's one on your desk. You want to take a car or walk to the Graham interview? You'll do a good job. I need to be elsewhere. Nina. Oh, go away. I was drunk. You say things when you're drunk, and the next morning...means nothing. Good to know. Rose. God, give me strength for tonight! Oh... Mother of sod, you forgot. Oh... You know, in some cultures, the entire family walks the bride to the next village. You're getting married in Kensal Rise. Say something funny. I put my hand on the vicar's cock. What? Sorry! Erm...did it feel nice? OK, OK. I'm hanging up on you now! Have you even eaten today? I think I had something with cheese around four. You have to eat. Donna... You have to talk to the girls. Then they'll hate me even more than they do already. I hated my mother. Even when I loved her. Oh, thank you. That's a great comfort. Car will be here in five. OK. Danny DeVito and you were up late last night. Simply going through accounts. And I wish you wouldn't call him that. Is everything all right? Yes, we were just having a little overview. You know? Shifting things about. Yes. Yes. Fine. The car's here. What's going on, Donna? Which accounts are those? Have a good night. Yeah, right. I'll bring Mrs Graham out in a moment. Thank you very much. Foreign Secretary's on a tight schedule. You look beautiful, darling. Thank you. You won't regret this. I've got him onto fly fishing. We might do the odd extra question on it. Clever you. You OK? I'm a state schoolgirl from Manchester at the height of my career. The work it has taken me to get here. It's not without love, our marriage. But I am married to a man whose particular predilection I just can't satisfy. I'm not used to failing. I don't see divorce as failure. I just see some marriages as finite. Mmm. When you are out of office... ...when you are away from the spotlight and all three boys have left home... ...when none of this matters any more... We make a break for the border. Discreetly. Quietly. Emma, he wants to start the interview. Away from the glare. I called your office. The case I'm on is the bitch from hell. Final hearing, and we didn't have half the paperwork. I was going to call you. I have a good lead on the... We got it early. Officially, you've got 12 hours' grace. Unofficially, erm... Unless it's a different Stern. Have you told Hannah? No. But by the end of play today, every paralegal in town will be poringover it. Tell her...before she hears about it from someone else. You wrote my dissertation. No. Did I? I did. Fine, we're quits. I want to not have to do this. When can I stop doing this? Clearing up my family's mess. I left Defoe's. No, you changed your name. That's something different. Hey! Jesus! Sorry. Sorry. Were you hiding? That obvious? I keep saying we need more light. They're all inside. I'm the vicar, Glen. I'm the sister, Hannah. Hi. And peonies all the way down either side. Lovely. Do you even know what peonies are? Not a clue. No. Ruth, I've changed to wearing red, just to give you the heads-up. It's quite bright, so it's probably best not to compete. I wouldn't want you to look washed out. I don't think we'll have that problem. Sorry! Sorry. Oh, good. Did the nice vicar rescue you? Wow, it's...definitely a church. Hi. Nice to meet you. Oh, hello. I'm Nathan, Hannah's husband. We're going to ask everyone to walk from here to the house. Nathan? You're in charge of ushers, so keep them in line. Yes, milady. Coming into the church, groom will be waiting that side, Then me - the bride - this side. Hannah and Nina, you'll be behind me. Hey. And Dad will walk me down to here. Dad's walking you down the aisle? Yeah, yeah. Ah, this must be Annie. Hello. Ah, Miles. Hello. Look at it. Look at it. Hasn't changed a bit. Nope. It's beautiful. They were married here. The frescoes have faded. Like everything. Oh, church makes you so morbid. Why must you be so morbid? Erm, where do I stand? Oh, erm... It's the biggest day of your life... No, cos at the moment we've got 140. I-I think we want to keep it small. I know, darling, but as you only get to do it once... Hopefully! Nina, now, who are you bringing? More wine? Incidentally, Ruth, we were wondering about your cheque? It's just the caterers are getting a bit antsy, that's all. We had over 300 at our wedding. I don't remember any of them. I'm certainly not in contact with any of them. It was hot and cramped, and my dress was too tight. It was such fun. Yes, it was, wasn't it? Cheer up. Miles, would you like a top-up? Why am I seeing roller skates? Roller disco. My ninth birthday. Didn't we, erm...? Roll back the carpets. I broke in my new skates on this floor. Yes. Of course. I have a photo of that day somewhere. Didn't I send it to you? Hmm. You sent him things? Yeah. In the beginning, yeah. For a while. We have a beautiful photo of you and Nathan at your wedding on our mantelpiece. Oh. When Vinnie was born, I knew that would be important. Finally, the Defoes had a boy. The real act of marriage is in the heart... ...but you might as well fill up the church while you're at it. The church isn't paying for it, so... Behave. Don't worry about that now. No? We, er... We almost missed our wedding. Hannah was... Hannah was late, and I, er, got stuck in the loo at the registry office. But, erm, when she did arrive, she looked so... ..red from, erm, running. Even so... It's a five-minute warning, cos we should... Ah. And he pours more wine. Even so... it was the best day of my life. Aww. Now, what about speeches? Yes! Speeches. Well, it's, erm, usually groom, best man, father of the bride, although I know Dad doesn't mind saying a few words. I'm very happy to do it. Mmm, well, I think Ruth was going to... Well... If you'd like to, Dad. Mum's doing it. I know, but... It should be Mum who does it. No, Nina... She hasn't written anything yet, so... Well, give her a chance. Or do you want to take that job too, Dad? I... She's been busy. Weren't you? Ah. Yes. And what will you say, Mother? What will you share on that wonderful institution that is marriage? Please... What? I'm curious, because, despite appearances, I don't exactly trust what we have to say. We're more finishers than starters, the Defoes. You need some air. No, I don't. Nina... You do not speak to me today! I have never had that much faith in marriage. Most people sell out, given half the chance. OK, we're going to step away from the wine. The one I could trust was yours and Nathan's, Hannah. You were so certain. As soon as you finished college, you were getting hitched, and I was so grateful that finally we had a good man who wanted to be in this family, and you two did it. You two did it. I don't think I've actually had a proper relationship. I barely know how to cohabit myself. Barely. But you two... Stop it... Really? Yeah, please, Nina. I'm doing this for you, Rose. You're spending all this money - money I don't think we've got. Enough. Not quite. You worry me, Rose. Really? Because I think you have some fantasy about the whole perfect marriage thing, and we should have told you it's a farce. Our parents were married, and it didn't stop our dear dad from screwing someone else... Sorry. Maya. ...who was in fact our 24-year-old nanny with a brace. She's yet to appear, by the way. Nina, could we please...? Yes, yeah, could we please stop this now? Could we please stop pretending in this whole happy-every-after pile of crap? Because everyone is lying. Everyone is lying. Even you, Nathan. Did you tell her? Tell me what? You put your hand on my arse and you said... Nina, please. "...Why doesn't she want to have sex with me any more?" Like I would have the answer? Why would I have the answer? I don't know who I'm going to screw from one week to the next. How do I know why Hannah doesn't want to have sex with you any more? And I know you care about James. I know you do. But, James, it's not enough to just get on top and hope she feels the same. Is it any wonder you put your hand on the vicar's cock? Rose? What are you doing? Excuse me. Well... No! Rose? James! James. I'm sorry. OK, here we go. I will not have this! I have not worked for the last 30 years to hold this family together just to have it torn apart. I will not do that. We will survive this. We must. I'm done with speeches today. I said the truth. No, the truth is everything around what you just said. You said what would hurt, Nina. Welcome back. Oh... Hannah... I was drunk. Nina? It didn't mean anything. Hannah? I'm tired. But we need to talk. Tomorrow. No. We need to talk now. Tonight. I'm on the list. Oh, my God... I was on my own. Erm, you remember the Brussels case? I... I never met anyone. I never went on any dates. Look at me. Look at me! Nothing, nothing, nothing happened. I just clicked and then suddenly... And that was it. It was just a moment's madness. The first time I saw you... There was only ever you. There was only ever you. No. The first time... Hannah, I... No, Hannah... Hannah, please. I... Please, listen, I love you. No. No. No! Hannah... No... No! Hannah! No... Hannah... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
