[fading footsteps] Come your name again? Piper. Chapman. That's Ms. Rossa. And that's Nichols. Just got out of SHU, a week ago. Told the CO, to kiss her ass. Dumb. Why make trouble for yourself, y'know? SHU... that's solitary? Yep. And you don't want it honey. Trust me. Here's some toilet paper. Gotta take it with you. Thanks. What's that thing? Oh. That's my machine. I need it at night. When I first got here, I had a massive heart attack. You know 'bout the count? Wait, can you go back to the heart attack? I don't like to dwell. How do I make a phone call? You need a pack number. Fill out a form, over the morrow. But maybe Caputo will let you make a call later. It helps, if you cry. [clicks tongue] Don't make your bed! What? We'll make it for you. Oh no, that's okay. You don't need to do that. Honey. We'll... make... The... Bed. You know how? I know how to make a bed. You know how to do it so we'll pass inspection. You can help clean. We clean everything with Maxi pads. Seriously? Yep. It's a head scratcher but... that's what we got. -So we make our beds in the morning, before they count. -No. You sleep on top of the bed, with the blanket over you. What if I want to sleep in the bed? Look. You can do what you want. But you will be the only one in this entire prison that does. You want that? [dusts hands] Be my guest. Count bed! Count bed! Count bedly! [grunts] That light comes on, you need to be where you're supposed to be. And you don't move, until it goes off. Dinner's after. [feet hit floor] Hey blanca. You speak Spanish? A little bit. I understand more than I can speak. You see? Fucking white girl, speaks Spanish. [chain jingles] [counter clicks] [snaps] -So... -Shh... [counter rapidly clicks] Dinner's at 4:30? Recount, ladies! [whispers] Ugh! They alway screw it up! How hard is it to fucking count? Nicky, this is um... Piper. Uh... Chapman. [scoffs] Look at you blondie. What d'you do? Aren't you not supposed to ask that question? I read that you're not supposed to ask that. You read that? What? You're gonna study for prison? [laughs] [counter rapidly clicks] What did you do? I can't understand your French. Mon bag... Bag. My bag hasn't arrived. Oh the bags. They don't make it onto the right flight sometimes. Wait for the next shuttle for Paris. It's probably on that plane. ♪ [buzzer goes off, machine clanks] Oh! Mon bag! My bag. Thank you! Thanks a lot! For your help! Hello. [gasps] Hello. [kisses] Welcome to Belgium. [kisses] All good? [inhales] I was starting to worry. Where did you come from? Over there. You didn't go through customs? No, I just walked out of that door and it brought me right here. You! [whispers]Skipped customs! Holy shit! -That's genius! -Well should I go back? Fuck no! We're going to the hotel! I'm gonna eat you for dinner. Alex, I was so freaked out when the baggage drop off lemmings bailed. Well it's a good thing you didn't. There's over 50 grand in that bag. Kruger woulda had you killed. [whispers] Come on! Keep moving! You're blocking up the works. Okay. Go sit there, she's a nice white lady. Thanks. Hi. Is it okay if I sit here? Sure, newbie. I'm Jones. Chapman. You doin' okay, Chapman? You know, I don't really know how to answer that question. Everything's... pretty surreal right now. Do you know what a mandala is? Um... Those are those round Buddhist art things. The Tibetan monks... Make them out of dyed sand... Laid out into big, beautiful designs. And when they're done, after days or weeks of work... They wipe it all away. Wow. That's... That's a lot. Try to look at your experience here as a mandala, Chapman. Work hard. To make something as meaningful and beautiful as you can. And when you're done, pack it in and know it was all temporary. You have to remember that. It's all temporary. [softly] It's all temporary. I'm telling you, surviving here... Is all about perspective. Don't eat the pudding. What's the perspective on the pudding? It comes in big cans marked "Desert Storm". Sometimes the kitchen has to scrape the mold off the top before they serve it. Hi there. Hey. Hi, sister. This is Chapman. Sister, as in nun? Mmhm. Yep, a killer nun. Oh, now stop it. She doesn't know you're joking. She chained herself to a flagpole at a nuclear test site. Amen. So. Now. Chapman. What's your story? I chained myself to a drug dealer. Piper. Can't be taking advice from a nun and a hippy. By all means. Seek out the supreme wisdom of the junkie philosopher. I pray for you, Nicky. Oh. I pray for you too, sister. I lust after you, yoga Jones. Those sinewy arms... [laughs] Gotta love a yoga body. You should come to class, watch me chaturanga. That whole common room smells like fart. It kinda takes away the magic for me. You like pussy, Piper? Or do you prefer pipes as your name suggests? I'm feeling some sapphic vibes comin' off of you. Oh, leave her alone. [sniffles] Come on, sister. You know you woulda gone my way if you hadn't married Jesus. Thank you, mommy. Thanks, Red. Thanks, Red. She's your mum? Ah, maternal figurehead. My actual mother lives in Brazil with her boyfriend, Paulo... Who destroys rainforests and collects photos of realistic art. She is a cunt. I'm an embarrassment. Heya, Red. Got one of those for me? You got what I asked you for? Uh... workin' on in it. So am I. Treats come when I sleep better. How hard is it to get me a board from the woodshop? Ugh. People. Who's this? Oh, this is Chapman. She's new. Self-surrender. Think she's fancy. Here. Fancy. Have a yogurt. What do I have to do for it? You're new. You're one of us. Consider it a gift. Thank you. Thank you so much! [whispers] The food here is disgusting. What? Red mention that Red runs the kitchen? Shit. I'm sorry. Lie. I know you just got here so you don't know what's what. But I'm gonna tell you. You don't like the food... It's no problem. ♪ Holy shit. That was an epic fuck up. Can I help you? Um...  I'm Chapman. I'm new today. They told me I should talk to you if I don't... have a... pack number... Who's they? Mr. Caputo... Please let me call me fiancée. Let him know that I'm okay. Two minutes. You got two minutes, that's it. Close the door. I don't want to run out my office. [door shuts] [clears throat] Dial 9 to get out. [dial tone] [phone rings] Hello? Larry's phone. -Amy? -Piper? Gimme the phone. One second. Can I say hello? Amy, I only have two minutes to talk. Are you okay? What's it like in there? Howard and I brought Chinese. Larry is so upset. -Let him talk, Amy. Come on, gimme the phone. Amy, please let me talk to Larry. You know, I read that when Martha Stewart was in prison... -She foraged for dandelions. -Okay. Um, please? -I was talking! -Maybe it's not always about you dear. What's that supposed to mean? -Piper. -I only have a minute now. I'm calling from the guard's office. Hey. Are you- Are you okay? What's going on? I love you so much. [laugh] I love you too. Are you okay? I'm wearing granny panties and I've only spoken to white people. Huh. Are you joining the Aryan Nation? I don't know. But there's a nun here and you're not allowed to sleep in your bed. Only on top of it. That's weird. I know, right? And when I got here they gave me these little... uh... Bars of hotel soap and no shampoo. But I think that I can borrow some. From other... white people... I love you so much! [inhales] One of my roommates had a massive heart attack when she got here. Okay. You are not allowed to have a heart attack. What did you have for dinner? Something my folks brought from the palace. Oh... The palace... Did you have a scary liver? And I insulted he chef. And... You're not supposed to eat the pudding because it's been to Desert Storm. Piper, listen to me, you cannot lose your shit. Okay? I mean it, please. Please tell me you're keeping it together, please? [inhaales] Please tell me you're okay? Wrap it up, Chapman. I'm... I'm Chapman here. You're my Pipes. Okay? And uh... I love you. And... [inhales] This is only temporary. That's what yoga Jones said. But it's just been one day and I can't... I can't. Piper, you can. You so can. Okay? You, you, you... Are so strong, babe. You... [inhales] And you love adventure right? That's what got you in there and that's, that's... What's going to get you through this. It's all just a- a big adventure. With liver, and uh... yoga Jones.
