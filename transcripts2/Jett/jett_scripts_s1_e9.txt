 On the platform, the biologist must take his samples, and his chances, among the sharp flensing knives on the blood-slick deck. Running does not help. Teeth are a prime target. More heat lost. Life is subject to the general diffusion of all energy. Concentrated heat was the past. Diffused heat is the future. The young lady's heat, eventually, will be lost in outer space. What time is it? Eight-thirty.

 I fell asleep? - Ms. Kowalski. - Ronnie. Follow me, please. This will be returned to you after. I was starving, so I already started. Please forgive me. Do you want to get yourself a plate? - No. - Are you sure? - Yes. - You know what they say. That breakfast is the most important meal of the day. You seem a little tense. There's something about you that makes me wanna kick your fucking face in, but... I'm all right. I think that you are downplaying it. What you want to do to me?

 Lamar Benjamin, aka Judge. Nasty piece of work. Twice deployed in Iraq, where he had a nervous breakdown at a raid in Fallujah. Came home, beat his girlfriend to death. A week later, he killed Jimarcus Hooks, known dope dealer he believed was screwing the girlfriend. At the trial, they brought in VA psychiatrists to testify, and they declared Lamar insane. He spent six months at a state hospital in Hawthorne, has been killing people ever since he got out. If you know all that, why can't you arrest him? Oh, we arrested him. In seven years of arrests, convictions, plea bargains, and insanity judgments, Lamar spent a grand total of 10 months behind bars. This all before he started his little... side business of killing for hire. I'd say he's murdered... at least 20 people. Tell me about the hotel manager. Hmm, a little squirrelly, - but he's been okay, I guess. - He's a day manager? Executive assistant manager. Parrish is who we dealt with during our surveillance. You want him to set up your guy? I'm not asking for your permission. You're taking a lot of chances walking in there. I don't have a lot of options. Can you get a hold of Parrish? He doesn't need to know any details. Guy could be sleeping, you know? He'll no doubt be surprised to see us. Walter! Honey! Walter! - What's wrong? - Shh! I think somebody's in the house. Don't fall asleep on me. All right. I'm awake. - I'm awake. - Did you not set the alarm? - Of course I did. - You forgot again. - No, I didn't. - Then how come it didn't go off? - Fuck. - What are you doing? - I'm gonna go see downstairs. - We should call 911. Whoa, whoa. Don't get ahead of yourself. Let me check it out. If you hear me raise my voice, then call the cops. That's stupid. - Try to stay calm. - Jesus Christ! - Who the fuck are you? - It's a home invasion! Annie, Walter, keep your voices down. This is not a home invasion. What... What do you want? My associate, Detective Dillon, is downstairs. He would like a word with you, Walter. - Why? - No, no, I know a Detective Dillon. What is this about? Come downstairs and we'll explain. I would've had him come up, but... his face is covered in stitches. It's a little distracting. And for the record, Walter did not forget to set the alarm tonight. Let me tell you a story. After the story, if you still feel like kicking my face in, or worse, well, then, at least you have the information you need to move forward. Please, sit down. Once upon a time, there was a beautiful woman, not your garden-variety beautiful. This woman was dramatically attractive. She had perfect skin, and... full lips, and when she smiled, it could melt an iceberg. And her name was Cristelle. And I was so in love with her. And she loved me, too. I believe that. The problem was that she was pregnant with another man's child. This man, he was a dangerous man. He was a real gangster. He's Charlie Baudelaire. And Charlie, well, he did not take kindly to her telling him that she had feelings for another man while she was carrying his child in her womb. Well, Charlie yelled at her, and he beat her, and he called her a whore. In retrospect, I believe we severely underestimated her power over us. We thought we were tussling over a fashion model. Two young men marking their territory. But I digress. - Sherman Grant Quinn. - No, no, Chin. - Why won't you come in? - Because I'm busy. - Go to bed, Vivian. - Answer me this one thing, but tell me the truth this time. I always tell the truth. - Like fuck you do. - Oh, you see? Yeah, well, I don't care for that kind of language. I don't give a shit what kind of language you care for. If I gave a shit, I wouldn't be talking at all, would I? - You know, you're not making any sense. - I'm making all the sense. Yeah, maybe you shouldn't drink so much. Just because you are in your own world and don't make an effort to understand jack shit of what I'm... How many times do you come to this fuck pad a month? - Good night, Vivian. - Bennie, you understand... Look, leave Bennie out of this! Go get undressed and get in bed! Oh, ho, ho. Now, it comes out. Are we a little horny maybe? We're done here. Good night. Charlie says we're done. Oh, okay, Charlie. Whatever you say. Charlie knows best. No, sir! Yes, sir! Charlie, sir! Get her in bed before I smack her. - Mrs. Baudelaire. - What ever happened to keep Bennie out of this? Why can't you just tuck me in? Good night! - Yes. - Charlie? Miljan Bestic. How'd you get this number? I heard about your son. Nothing I can say will make that better. But I have a proposition for you. More like a gift. Why doesn't he want to tuck me in? Doesn't even want to touch me, he's so tired out from all of his skanky whores. He has no need for this. Vivian... His son was murdered today. Do you know I almost got murdered, too? You told me, yes. He was so close. I almost peed in my pants. - I'm gonna go now. - Help me with this first. Please? She's gonna be fine. Who else do you want me to try? That's it for tonight. When the baby was born, Charlie sent some men to steal it from her... because he knew that if it was raised under her hand, the child would grow to hate his father, and he would not have a proper heir for the business he was building. So, Charlie brought Junior here, and he raised him in the States. And I dated this woman... in the aftermath of this awful tragedy. A mother having her child stolen from her. Can you imagine that? Of course you can. Many years later, I learned that Junior was in Marseilles, doing business in his father's name. He is buying weapons from this... particularly nasty arms dealer that I know. So, I insert myself into this evening. And I watch him, and I talk to him. It's Junior. His eyes reminded me so much of my dearly departed Cristelle. Her death was no accident. Charlie was behind it, bet you didn't know that. Am I boring you? So, I am boring you. Only a little. Well, that evening in Marseilles was one of degenerate debauchery. There were drugs, fucking, beatings, what have you. And I make sure that Junior is roasted and toasted beyond fucking imagination... so that when he wakes up in the morning with three underage male prostitutes chopped in pieces, well, he's beside himself. And I help him. And I counseled him. I clean up his mess. - Do you follow what I am saying? - Yes. I don't think that you do. No matter how Charlie tried to raise his child to do as he was told, Junior grew up spiteful. A snake snapping at its own tail, so you used that. You can imagine the level of gratitude he feels for me. You can imagine the immense debt he owes me, knowing that I have pictures of his misadventures. Pictures that, at any moment, I could give to the task force that is investigating the Baudelaires. You know some of those detectives, I believe. Whatever you think you're doing, whatever provocation you believe will catch me off guard, I'm not interested. I came here to tell you, I will not do what you ask me to do. I won't do anything more for you. I assume you came in the hopes of killing me. But killing me will not solve your problem with Charlie, so why don't you just kill him instead, and settle our account? Charlie and I will work out our differences without you. You can't honestly believe that. We're done, you and I. - We are not done. - We are done. Perfect timing. Charlie. Yeah! Yeah! Oh yeah! Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me harder! Yeah, yeah, yeah, harder, harder! This is the cat. When was this? Two months back, maybe. Cops still have no idea how it was done. - He works independent. - He does. Matter of fact, motherfucker plays better with Eskimos. I don't have time to waste on some hard-on who can't hold a conversation. Oh, you're paying the bills, he'll talk to you. He just can't stand the Italians, or the Mexicans, or the Russians, or the Colombians. - He doesn't work very often then. - Eh. He's eccentric like that, but this is a tough proposition, right? You want somebody liable to not crack up on you. This is a man that can make things happen. Hang on a second. Get out of here! Fuck. It's gonna cost me a few dollars. Goddamn thrill seekers. I blame the Internet. They spend all day staring at free pussy. They figure they can just walk up in here and steal the real deal. Snatch the snatch, get it? How soon can you get a hold of him? Well, how soon you need this done? - Nine a.m. - As in today? As in today. Woo! Everybody's in a hurry. Slow down. You'll live longer, mama. You're right. Wish I could. Must be a fine line playing it close to the vest and staying high enough to wait around this dump. Here's five. The rest when you're done. Whoa, whoa, whoa. You think I'm the cat? Like I told you, I'm only the middleman. I asked around about you, I know you did the same, so let's cut the cute stuff. Is there even a remote chance you're wearing a wire right now? But you're not gonna show me. You wanna see bare-ass women, look around. Here's the exact time and place he'll be at. If you think you're gonna pull a rope and the net's gonna drop on me, mm-mm, don't do it. I won't. Well, that's mighty honorable of you. The point I want to make: I don't fuck lady cops. That makes two of us. You're a girl who's used to calling her own shots, - aren't you? - How'd you pick up on that? What are you doing here? Looking for Eddie. He's not here? - Nope. - Where is he? Uh, last I heard, he was dropping you off. Aren't you supposed to be at work? I got there and my dipshit manager said I got the shifts mixed up. But I didn't. He just double-booked this crackhead junkie he's trying to play daddy to. - Can I come in? - Sure. - What were you doing? - Just watching TV. I like what you've done with the place. Eddie said you did time. Where was that? At Jackson, Michigan. My mom's originally from Lansing. I never need to set foot in that state again, no disrespect to your mom. You're a Marine, too? No, US Army sniper. That's kind of bad-ass, right? It is what it is. Where'd you go to learn to do that? Fort Benning, Georgia. I'm a pretty good dancer. - Okay. - That was kind of random, huh? Sometimes, I skip a beat and think I said something out loud and jump to the next thought. Like I was thinking, wow, sniper. That's a bad-ass skill. Do I have any bad-ass skills? And then I was thinking, I'm a pretty good dancer. Makes sense. Even though I didn't say any of it out loud. I get you. Tonight, I had planned a whole new choreography that I was really excited about, which sounds corny, but, truth is, half the time you're up there, you're thinking about your taxes or... a fight you had with your boyfriend, so it's pretty ironic that tonight, I was looking forward to trying out a new dance. Is that the correct use of the word ironic? I have to think about that one. Do you like getting lapped? - Hmm? - Jail plus Army time means you're, like, a thousand lap dances short compared to your average male civilian. So, why don't I put on a show just for you? Malibu, I don't think that's such a hot idea. Mmm. It's gonna be hot. Watch. Are you on something right now? Why, because I'm being friendly? I don't know that I shouldn't be offended by that. You must've jacked off a lot in prison, huh? - What? - I said, you must've jacked off a lot in prison. You do what you gotta do. Did you have a prison wife? But... a lot of guys do that, right? Get another con to play their wife? I didn't do that. Did you... fantasize about different women, or... how does it work? I always wonder with guys. Do you think about experiences you had in the past, or do you just invent stuff? Both, I suppose. I never really gave it much thought. Tell you what, this'll go in the memory bank. You're sweet. Here. You can touch. I thought you weren't allowed to touch. Regular customers, no. You get your fucking head knocked off by the bouncer, but... private, it's a little more... flexible. Do you like me so far? You wanna get on the train? What train? Open up. - What is it? - Just a little X. To get cozy, loosen you up. It's not like you have to go to work tomorrow, right? I never really done X before. It's so good for you. They used to prescribe it in couple's therapy. It just... cuts out all the bullshit. Makes you more truthful. And this one is so pure, not so speedy. Do you like my ass? - Yes. - My legs? Yeah. - My tits? - A lot. This is so rad. I'm flying right now. Strictly speaking, this next part is not allowed, but... when you're patient, God rewards you. - How does that feel? - I have... mixed feelings about it. Poor baby. You must be so tired of the Vaseline and tissues routine. It is what it is. I feel a responsibility like... like a nurse in World War II. Malibu, I... don't think Eddie would understand. But I wanna support our troops. You kept our country safe. - Fred, open the fuck up! - Shit, shit. - He knows. - How? - I don't know. - You should go in the bathroom. No. But we didn't do anything wrong. Hey! -I don't think he's gonna see it that way though. - Abigail. - What? My real name is Abigail. I fucking hate it, but it's better than Malibu. - The fuck is wrong with you, man? - I fell asleep. With this queer music on? Shit works on my nerves. - Get dressed. - Uh, what's up? I've been calling and calling. I'll explain on the way. I got your 308 out of storage. Uh, what are we doing? We gotta bail Kowalski. Thought you had a broad in here. Excuse me. Yes? I see. Better for you if you sit back down. Yes. What do you want, Miljan? I want to end this juvenile rivalry between us. Consider it done. But first, I want to finish telling Jett the story I was telling her. After that, you can do with her whatever you wish. She will be my personal gift to you. Please. So, when Charlie here, not willing to let old bygones be bygones, hired you to steal from me the engagement ring that Cristelle kept until the moment of her death. A ring that's worth, what, 2,000 bucks? But get this. It once belonged to Charlie's mother. So sentimental. Well, Junior felt obliged to give me the heads up. Do you remember when I told you about Jean Tingley? Who the fuck is Jean Tingley? Jean Tingley once built a machine simply to watch it self-destruct. Viktor Solonik needed proof that Charlie had no power. What are you talking about? You are that proof. You've met Solonik, haven't you? Viktor, meet my dear friend, Jett. Pleasure to meet you, Jett. Sorry if I kept your friend. - Once. - Viktor Solonik runs things here. Not everything. It's astonishing. You better have thought this all the way through. This backstabbing cunt has been stealing right from underneath your fucking nose, Charlie. Gold bricks that you have a stake in. The roadster you stashed in Portsmouth. She was just getting started. He threatened to kill Alice. Do not get me started on your faggot son. He killed the judge that you bought. He pays some speed freak a thousand dollars to memorize a story about heroin shipment, and take a shot at you. This is all amateur bullshit, but you were too blind to see it. Your son, Junior, did this to you, you senile old man. Sit down! To wild cards. Better shoot me now, motherf... As you wish. Who's there? Hello? Where's the girl? What girl? Don't waste my time. I don't know. Oh, I hate when people lie to me. It'd be so much better for you if you'd just simply tell me what I need to know. Or else what? You... should be afraid of me. There is nothing you can do to me. Life already did much worse. You're just a shadow. You have no power over me. Where's Alice? Nurse! Nurse! Nurse! We're gonna drive straight through, if you wanna catch a nap. I'm not sleepy. I'm wide awake. - Why are you smiling? - I'm not. - You look happy. - Do I? Like you just pissed against a church. I feel really good. I don't know about you. Something happened to you in the can. I love you, too, brother. You're a weird fucking dude, you know that? You're... you're my best friend, Eddie. Never known Kowalski to put something together this last minute, so something major must be going down. There's a decoy already in place. She wants you to take the kill-shot. Copy that. This man's simplicity was overwhelming towards the end. It's not your fault, Bennie, so don't make it personal. There are a lot of guys who could use a man like you. Now, go on. Get out of here. This is a one-time offer only. She's staying. You sent this guy? I knew you'd try to pull something. Mr. Bestic, I'm Walter Parrish, the executive assistant manager. We need to get you out of here, sir. There's another gunman in the building. You need to come with me, please. What about my wife? Why... yes, of course, uh, Mrs. Bestic. - I'm fine here. - Sweetheart, there's another gunman. You go. I twisted my ankle. It's better you come. For Alice's sake. - What about Alice? - You'll see. You'll be safe in here. Call your friend, Phoenix. Go on. Phoenix! No! Drive! Alice, run! Run! Phoenix! - Hello? - It's me. He took her. The guy in Maria's photos. He took her. I'm so sorry. Did you honestly think that I would walk into a situation with you without taking out insurance? Oh God! What are you doing? Mr. Parrish. I'll take it from here, thank you. Okay. Where is she? If you kill me, you will never find her. My daughter. - Time to go. - My daughter! I have nothing personal against you. Solonik is cleaning house. I don't know anymore. I am middleman. But don't kid yourself. The Russians will skin you alive. This is not you. You are a professional. None of what you are doing makes any sense! You're letting your feelings take over. I'm not gonna argue with you. You are signing your own death sentence! You keep saying that. Viktor Solonik will never forgive this. He will hunt you down and kill you. I'll take my chances. Clear the lobby! Move it! Go! Fred said things got a bit confusing. He get out? He's out. What time is it? - Eight-thirty. - I fell asleep? What were you dreaming about? What? You were making little sounds in your sleep. Something was upsetting you. That's what you wanna talk about, what I was dreaming? What do you wanna talk about? I don't remember any of my dreams since... I was 9 or 10. Back then, I always dreamed of baseball. Are we really having this conversation? - I'll call you when it's done. - I'm not sure I'll be here. I wouldn't go out wandering, I were you. It's not that simple. It never is. Good luck today. How you doing, partner? Stop the car. Jackie? What's wrong? He... he took Alice. What? I fucked up. Are you okay? No. Where are you right now? Wait. There's more. She's yours. What? I know I should be telling you this in person, but... I got afraid I wouldn't see you again. You're her father. I'm sorry I didn't tell you before. I don't know if she's alive. I'll help you find her.
