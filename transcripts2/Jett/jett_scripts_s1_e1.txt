 No, no, you can't tell me that, man. Well, you would've done the same thing if Mrs Charlie Baudelaire had asked you. No, I would not. Okay, just walk me through it, okay? So, she's... She's in the pool, and she says what, to just, "Come get in with me?" She said she's all wet in there, and I'm so dry. - Would I care to join her for some laps? - Well, that's, um... That's a what-you-call-it... That's a, a, a euphemism. And I politely tell her that I didn't bring my trunks, and just like that, her maid's bringing a pair of surf trunks belonging to the big guy. So, I excuse myself, go to the john, no idea how I got myself into this predicament,

 and when I'm about to slip them on, I notice they got built-ins. What? The fuck is a built-in? What, you mean... he stringy, meshy... No! You did not wear those. - What was I gonna do? - You cut 'em out! You're basically sharing very intimate space with another man's junk. I'm not cutting Charlie Baudelaire's surf trunks. - His favorite, she says. - Okay, well... put your underwear in between you and the trunks. I didn't think about that. What I thought was the man's got a washing machine. A washing machine? A washing machine? You're telling me if you go in with some forensic CSI-type shit, you're not gonna find some leftover dead skin, or some skanky old scrotal...

 Okay, enough! - That his lunch? - That's sweet. Wouldn't mind a wife making me lunch every day. What the...? Who the fuck are you? Felix? That's what I'm trying to tell you. The, uh, intended kidnap victim was having an affair with a neighbor, and he is... or was a jiu jitsu instructor. What are the chances? He overpowered Carl and I shot him. No, the jiujitsu instructor. I know, it took me by surprise as well, big surprise. We're still here. No, nobody heard. If they had, they would've come by now. We're safe, it's... just, well, we got a body to move and it's daylight. Uh-huh. I understand. I do respect your orders. Not a hair. She's, uh... emotionally distressed, understandably so, but in no way harmed. Did I already miss her? A minute ago. You want breakfast? No, thank you. I already ate. - What time's your appointment? - Three. I can pick you up at work. - You know what? I want to go alone. - Why? Easy. I'm gonna talk, you're gonna listen, okay? Just so we're clear, the people that we work for know where you live, know where Alice goes to school, know the address of her teacher Ms Kennedy, know your maid Maria's daily routine, know your bartending schedule four times a week. You understand? Good. Sit down. Last night, you spent some time with Charlie Baudelaire in his hotel suite. Next time you see him, we need a favor. Engage Charlie in a little S&M.; Have him cuffed when we walk in, we'll take it from there. We just wanna have a chat with him, that's all. - How does that sound to you? - Tell her the best part. The best part is you get to walk away, so does your daughter, her teacher, and your maid. You do this for us, you walk out alive. You don't, well... We know where to find you, right? Now, do I need to slap you around a little, make sure you're grasping everything I'm telling you? Do I need to drag your maid in here, hurt her? You got nothing to say? Maria's not my maid. - Ms Kowalski. - Ronnie. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Bennie. Carl. Sight for sore eyes. He's in the sort of mood only you can fix. - His wife again? - What else? It's scary how you read my mind. What's so interesting out there? Thinking about my friend Jacques McCabe. Works as a tour guide in the Keys. That's where you're originally from, isn't it? - Gainesville. - Oh. Right. I forgot. A couple months back, Jacques is driving into Miami after the weekend. Gets stuck in traffic. Uh, some accident or something, the whole freeway's backed up, and he's at the off-ramp, and he gets rear-ended by this cherry 1971 Ford Pantera. - You're familiar with the Pantera? - Not to be a girl about it, but no. Frankly, I'm surprised. Given your line of work, I would have thought you'd stolen more than one. - Former like of work. - Oh, former. Yes. The Pantera was exported to the United States by the great Italian sports car manufacturer De Tomaso. Problem is, they were so temperamental, that even the king himself, allegedly, shot his when it wouldn't start. In any case, Jacques gets rear-ended by one, gets out of his car, the owner of the Pantera is beside himself with grief. Can't believe he's done this. So they inspect both cars, and they realize that there is absolutely, positively no visible damage. I mean, nothing whatsoever, not even a scratch. But then, Pantera guy's wife gets out of the car, and she says, oh, wait a minute. Nobody moves till the cops arrive. We're sticking to the letter of the law. - Even though they're the one who rear-ended your friend? - Yeah! So now, they're out there waiting an hour and a half. Finally, cop comes. They explain what happened, and this cop takes one look at the Pantera and he says, "Are you kidding me? I'm not even gonna write this up, it's so dumb. I suggest you get in your cars, and you go home." Yesterday, Jacques is on the phone with his insurance agent, and the agent says, "Hey, do you remember that guy who rear-ended you a couple months back?" "Yes." "Well, 10 minutes after he got home, he dropped dead from a brain hemorrhage." - No way. - Previous condition. Totally unrelated freak coincidence. But that means that this guy, thanks to his lovely wife, spends his last hour and a half waiting for a cop to write a non-ticket on a bogus non-accident. It's beautiful, right? I could just put these on you, take your mind off such worrisome matters. - Who is it? - Dad? It's me. - All clear. - Come in. - We got 'em. - Both of them? - Both of them. - Dead? Whoa, whoa. Save the shoptalk for later. I don't need all these details. - How you doing, Jett? - Not too bad, Junior. I'm signing off. I'm sure you boys need your family time. Wait, come here. What you did tonight was above and beyond. I won't forget it. - Don't mention it. - Here. For Alice. - Buy her something nice to wear. - You don't need to do that. All it is, is exactly that, a gift for your daughter. Please, take it as a token of my gratitude. Jett? My God, Jett Kowalski. Um... You staying here? In the hotel? No. I'm just... I'm meeting someone. - Oh, business. - I could ask you the same. You could. When'd you get out? - Four months ago. Good behavior. - Good behavior? I'm surprised. But I'm happy to hear that. You working? - Part-time, bartending. - Bartending? Pouring booze in a glass for tips. - You're married? - No. Full-time. Cute. Is that her? Colleague, we're, uh, working. You're not undercover these days, are you? - It's really good to see you. - Hope not. I mean, unless you're disguised as an undercover cops. I'm glad you're out. That's sweet. So long, Jackie. Jackie? Is that what she called you? - Give it a rest, okay? - No. Too glib for me, but I can see the appeal. I owe her a lot. - From your undercover days? - That woman is a world-class thief. Was she also something that you had to do to protect your cover? Ten years ago, I infiltrated the organization of a five-star wacko. Guy named Frank Sweeney, ever hear of him? The drug lord? The one who uses nail guns on his competition? Jett was new to the crew... How you feeling, sweetness? I got a crick in my neck. Oh, you hear that, Murphy? Grace under pressure. I know what you are, so... you might as well get it off your chest. - What are you talking about? - I got a plane to catch, so let's speed this up, officer. Talk to me. Tell me what happened. Only four of us knew about Lafayette. Murphy, Dennon, Blair, and me. But you knew, didn't you? The deal was clean and simple, now it's compromised. Your logic is not tracking. Bring Blair in here. We'll see what's what. - Is he your partner? - What is this, boss? Shoot this piece of shit for me. You see that, Murphy? - What's going on? What'd she do? - Don't worry. You did good. You ever smell flesh burning? It'll make you puke on yourself before you start choking, and then you'll puke some more, shit yourself. It's not a dignified way to go, trust me. It's the way a rat should go, a piece of scum like you. You give me your contact, or get ready to go up in flames like some falafel fuckhead in a protest. Your turn. Ask Murphy where he was last night. Ask him why he wasn't at the safe house. - What are you saying? - Ask him about the phone call he made from the bar. I've known it all along he was a rat. Sorry I had to use you to smoke him out. Dennon! That was my name then, Dennon. The way she played it, I didn't have to shoot anyone. Help her get cleaned up. We leave in half an hour. - Murphy wasn't the leak. - Shh. Breathe. - You're in shock. - It was you. I hate cops, but I hate that son of a bitch worse. I suggest you get out of here, and never let me see you again. And you never saw her till today? I ran into her a couple of times. You mean to tell me you knocked boots with a known felon, Detective? She knew who I was and kept her mouth shut. Why would she do that, you think? I took her advice and quit undercover. I was clearly not as good as the job required. Hmm. And Frank Sweeney? Ended up a quadriplegic. - Mystery shooter. - Saint Jett Kowalski? Nobody knows. Her file says she did a nickel in Jackson. On a Mickey Mouse charge, but they had to get her on something. I tell you, she'd have made a hell of a cop. You gotta go. Use both hands. - You're new, right? I'm Veronica. - Hi. I've seen you here with your nanny. That's my son, Miles. - Hi, sweetheart. What's your name? - Alice. Aren't you just the sweetest little muppet? I thought you might want to join our play group. What do you play? Truth be told, we play sudoku, but... it's really just for the kids to feel safe. You know, this park sometimes has some not-so-solid citizens. Uh, that's Evelyn and Barb. Barb has the most adorable husband. We all tease her that he must be gay because he's so freaking handsome. But you just moved here recently, right? - Yeah. - Yeah, where did you live before? Prison. - Good night, monkey. - Good night, Mom. - Mom? - Yes? Do all monsters live on the moon? Most of them. - Mom? - Monkey? Maria seems a little... I don't know. - That's why she went to the doctor. - She won't tell me what's wrong. I'll talk to her. - Looks like she's done. - I wouldn't mind tucking her in. Hey, where you going? I'm gonna take a piss. You wanna hold it? Nah, come on. Your piece, slowly. On your knees. Easy. Your gun. - Where's Junior? - We left messages. Maybe he's out. Wanna tell me why two dead guys are outside my house? Yes. Let 'em go. - Let them go? - They work for my son. - It was a test. - What test? To see if I could trust you. I have a proposition for you! She's not smiling. Not exactly. I mean, she's not ripping it up either. I want you to steal a ring for me. - A ring? - A ring. It belongs to a man I do business with. Is this what that test was about? Former version of yourself, I would've never doubted. But prison changes people. I had to be sure. I'm sorry. I get the test part, but why have them follow me after? Yeah, it's a good question. I'll check with my son. I'm not going back to prison, Charlie. Not for you, not for anyone, not ever. I quit. You didn't quit. You got caught, there's a big difference. You do this job, you'll have enough to retire with. I appreciate you coming to me, and I mean zero disrespect, but my civilian job pays for what Alice needs... They call him the Russian, but he's not Russian. He's from one of those Eastern European countries, changes names every five minutes. The point is, this bastard has a safe full of all sorts of shit I have no interest in whatsoever and neither should you. If any of that shit were to go missing, this job would be an official failure. Epic disaster. Major repercussions. The only item in this man's safe I'm interested in, the safe I'm proposing that you pick, is a ring, about yea big, worth north of... Aah. Never mind what it's worth, but to you? It's worth half a million bucks. If you need a safe cracked, why not hire a safecracker? Yeah, that's a good point. You see, it's not that simple. This man has many enemies. Now, I've been going around it in my mind, and I can't think of a better way to get into his house, to get to the safe, but through the front door. And that's where you have the advantage over any hotshot safecracker. I'm not saying sleep with him. It's your prerogative. And all you want is this one ring? Here's the fun part. I want you to replace the ring with a replica I'm gonna give you. Now, you do your job right, he'll never know. - Where is this Russian man? - He's in Havana. - Havana, Cuba? - Birthplace of rum and Perez Prado. What size crew? Well, there's the rub. This guy's very well-connected, and it's a very small island. Any kind of crew shows up, he's gonna know. No crew. No weapons. It's gotta be you plus a safecracker. So, you want me to go into a totally unknown situation, with no backup whatsoever with some Russian gangster, in Cuba? You're the only person that can do this job. If you don't do it, it doesn't get done, and I need this done. I gotta pick up my kid at school. Bennie. Only one person I'd even consider doing this job with, and he's got three years left in Atwater. If that's who you need, maybe that can be arranged. - That can be arranged? - For a fee. But if Quinn's the only person you can do this with... He is, and you said if I don't do it, it doesn't get done. See that? I love how your mind works. Let me see what I can do. Who the fuck are you? You ready for this? Go ahead. Chris. - Hello? - Associate Warden Dwight Tucker? - Speaking. - Don't say a word, just listen. - Honey? - Rosalie? I'm okay. Just do what they say. We won't touch her if you do as we say. - Who are you? - I can be your best friend or your worst nightmare. It's up to you. There's an inmate named Rufus Quinton. You're gonna trade him for your wife. You have today to figure it out. Tomorrow, we make the trade. I will call you at 7:00 a.m. sharp. If you contact anyone, I personally guarantee I will personally sodomize your wife every hour, on the hour, chop her up, and mail you the body parts. How's it hanging, Tucker? That was just for effect. Put it out of your mind. If your husband loves you... ...he'll do as he's told, and this whole episode will be an exciting survival story you share at cocktail parties. Except for the part about the jiujitsu instructor. What are you doing anyway, messing around behind your husband's back? Man, he got you good. You make the call? How'd it go? I said "personally" twice in the same sentence, so it sounded stupid. Anyway, I think he got the message. - How'd it go at the apartment? - It's wiped clean. - And Bruce Lee? - He's in a landfill. We're back in business. - How is she? - Emotional. - Infirmary transfer. - Wrong cell, pal. If I were you, Quinton, I'd get up and come with me now without any questions. - None of that is very professional. - You keep your fucking mouth shut. - Let's go. - You gotta admit, it's a conflict of interest, you giving me advice. Do not make me fucking repeat myself. Okay. Don't over react. What's the big mystery... Wear it. - Go ahead. - Okay. The thing about the cops is they're not really good at keeping things quiet. You understand? That's why it's key you don't tell them what we look like. In theory, it seems like that would benefit you, but in... in practice, they would make such a mess of looking into it that we'd hear about it, and then we'd have no choice but to... I will never tell a soul what you look like. That's really the right thing to do. You know, even though it's counterintuitive. I know you're scared right now, but it's really important that you don't forget to breathe. Here we go. Good luck. - Oh God. - Quinn. Bennie? It's okay, it's okay. It's just the tires. Was that great shooting, or was that great shooting? - Living the dream. - You can write that down! - Anybody mind bringing me up to speed? - We're on a need-to-know basis. I tell you what I know. I wouldn't wanna be that chick's therapist right now. It ain't much, but this'll be home for a little while. You'd be surprised what I'm used to. - Got this for you. - Thanks. - And this old thing? - Junior will explain. You won't need this, but just in case. - It's clean. - Appreciate it. - Who is it? - It's me, Charles Junior. I don't wanna come across as ungrateful, but... you could've asked me about the job before getting me out. It wasn't my idea. It was my old man's, and Jett. - And what's she got to do with this? - Oh... Well, I don't feel comfortable being the one telling you... - Telling me what? - You better just let her explain. - I'm here strictly on business. - And what is our business? How long would it take for you to crack that? No tools, no drilling. - Ten minutes. - No kidding? You're that good, even after all this time? Well, for your trip abroad. Jett will fill you in on the rest. - Junior. - Charles Junior. Charles Junior. Since when do Jett and your dad come up with ideas together? - Don't ask me that. - I'm asking you. Well, all I can tell you is... the first time it happened, the old man said that it was hands down the greatest two days of fucking in his entire life. Take care, Quinton. Hold your ground. Don't let him use his looks to distract you. You sound like a fortune cookie. Do I sound nervous? I'm not that nervous. Here's my advice. Unless you plan on having a long conversation before, go with green. It's me. Are you with Charlie? Choose wisely. You wanna talk before or after? Junior says that you're the old man's number one. Junior's got a lot of time to think about things. That a number? That's the first one. So it's true? What is? Charlie's always been there for me. Sent money for Alice while I was inside. Once in a while, he needs a little break from the wife, and I keep him company. That's the second one. Charity then? I forgot talking to you was like trying to solve a fucking puzzle. I'm only trying to get up to speed. No, you're not. You want the gory details, so you can obsess about them. You're right. I'm sorry. - I'm right? - I mean, you did what you had to do. You gave me back three years of my life. Thank you. I hated every minute in that God damn place. - What's the time? - Just under seven. I can do better. You know how many times you said "you're right" to me before? I'm not trying to make it a habit either. You wanna tell me about this deal you made with Charlie? - What? - He's here. Don't turn around. - He's with a man and two women. - What are they like? The man's very talkative. The women are young. The Russian looks bored. Do me a favor. Don't watch. I couldn't help but notice you having dinner over there. So, I was wondering, do you not trust that your drink will make it intact from the bar to the table? - Are you a spy for the hotel? - If I was, I could not tell you. - But you can keep a secret. - It depends. I'm taking a break from the world's most boring dinner. - Are you on your honeymoon? - That would be unbearable. Yeah? Why is that? The friend I came with, he isn't exactly, uh... He plays for the other team, if you know what I mean. - Are you American? - I could be. You Americans always say, "you know what I mean." Why is that? Maybe because we're hard to understand. I'm Maggie. - Miljan Bestic. - Miljan, is that Polish? Close. Maggie, let me buy you another drink. Well, I'd like that, but I can't leave my friend alone for too much longer. Let me buy your boring friend a drink, too. So, what brings you to Havana? - Ask him. - Ava Gardner. - Ava Gardner? Isn't she dead? - Not when we're through with her. - She'll be as alive as you or me. - Oh, you must forgive Maggie. That's how actresses speak when somebody doesn't write their lines. - Spoken like a true writer. - Oh, you're a writer? - He writes movies. - Anything that I would know? - I'm sorry. - What are you doing? - What do you think I'm doing? - You're drunk. Hardly. I've had two drinks. I apologize for my behavior. In truth, William has reason to be offended. - Oh, here we go. - See, in Hollywood, lots of times, writers get hired to write movies - that, for one reason or another... - Usually another. ...never get made, and you can have quite a lucrative career doing that. - But you do develop a slightly... - Cynical? Off-putting air of bitterness about everything. That's Hollywood for you. Another day, another indignity. So, you are an actress? I am. You like American nighttime soaps, Milton? Miljan. - I'm not very familiar with them. - Hmm. I'm sorry. Whatever booze they put in this rum is no joke. - Just have one more round with us. - I'm going to sleep. I trust you will release Maggie from your grip at a decent hour? We have much to do tomorrow. Of course. - Did I wake you? - No. He wants to have dinner tomorrow. Some little family restaurant. - How's that work? - You'll know where I am at all times. - May I come in? - What about your rule? - What rule? - The no-sex-on-the-job rule. First off, it's not a rule. And second, who said anything about sex? So, you just wanna sleep together? No funny business? I'm warning you. I sleep naked. You learn that in the clink? She met him at the Havana Hilton. This is 1959, maybe '60. Now, she thought Fidel made a whole bunch of sense. You know, she asked him flat out if it was true that he hated Americans. And what did he say? That he found Americans to be very sympathetic. He only hated Richard Nixon. It's gonna be a great scene, right? - Little family restaurant, huh? - You should see the family. Tell me something, Miljan Bestic... - Are you married? - Not anymore. - Why? - I'm not looking for trouble. Be honest with me. Do you have a girlfriend? There are a couple of women that I date. Are they over 18? I hope so. I'm fairly sure. How about kids? Never found the time. - You? - Nope. I always thought I'd have a little girl and name her after my grandmother. - What was her name? - Grandma. Her name was Grandma. I wanna see where you live. One armed guard, each gate, front and back. Twenty-second drive from the main gate to the front door. Entry way. Kitchen off to the side. Good view of the courtyard. Outside lights run on a switch, not timer. Three, here, here, here. This one is out. Courtyard leads to a pool or maybe a fountain, I'm not sure. Bathroom is here. Small window. You can fit, but I like the kitchen better. Master bedroom is up the stairs, to the right, right here. Safe is either here or here. - Staff? - They leave by 10:00. - You sure there are no cameras? - None. It's 1959 all the way. - We're one man short. - At least. - What's over here? - Residential street. Not particularly well lit. I need the garden lights out for 30 seconds, - and him out of the bedroom seven minutes after that. - I'll give you 10. - When? - I had a tummy ache. Promised I'd make it up to him tomorrow night. Because you can tell a lot about a man by what he has in his fridge. We are what we eat. Hm, some eggs. Lettuce, okay. Tomatoes, good, good. Very healthy, a little boring. I was expecting a lot more red meat. Stop driving me crazy. Wait, wait, wait, I wanna check the freezer. Make sure there's not a human hand or something! You're not wearing anything under that dress, are you? I hate panty lines. You know, there's something that I've always wondered about. In movies, actors kiss all the time. So, what's that difference between that kiss, and a real life kiss? You really can't tell? Here's a movie kiss. And here's a real kiss. This is a very important room. Wait, wait. What's down that hallway? Do you know who Jean Tinguely was? - An ex-lover of yours? - No. Tinguely was a great Swiss artist. He was a... He was a sculptor. He developed something called metamechanics. In 1960, he built a machine whose only purpose was to destroy itself. - What do you think about that? - I don't know. I think it was a very courageous act. I, too, one day would like to build a machine whose only point is to self-destruct. Let's take this off. Come to bed. You take all of your girlfriends there. Take me somewhere else. Thanks for a great night. You are a true gentleman. May I call you later? I'd be offended if you don't. - Are you okay? - What are you doing? - Did he hurt you? - No, I'm fine. - I packed your bags. Let's go. - Now? But our flight is... I changed it. Fill you in on the way. Let's go. - Really? I'm pretty beat. - I'm sure. Is that what this is about? You're jealous? I just don't remember the part where you and I declared our everlasting vows to each other, so for you to suddenly develop this unprofessional degree... I would've taken the job, too. It was a smart play. Look, I'm not holding any of it against you, seriously. But there's something wrong here. Bestic and Junior know each other. There were blackmail photos in the safe. Junior and boy toys, Junior and dead boy toys. I mean really nasty stuff, Daisy. Wait, hold on. You're going way too fast for me. Wait, wait. Hey, hey, hey! Don't you put your hands on her! Hey! Get your hands off her! Daisy! Will you look at that? Classic paradox. The mind says no, but the body says go. Like an Ava Gardner movie. Isn't that fascinating? Endlessly. William, the bitter screenwriter, could write a great scene of this for your movie. - Where is he? - I wouldn't worry about Mr. Quinton. - Where is he? - Dead. Where is he? I told you. For your sake, you better not have touched him. I'm touching you... And it doesn't seem there's anything you can do about that, does it? Who do you work for, Daisy M. Kowalski? Nobody. Your parents, Fitzgerald fans or Walt Disney's? Let's switch subjects. Who do you work for? I told you. Nobody. Fair enough. Fair enough. Bring him in! Thieves come into my house to steal from me. But when I ask them a simple question, they refuse to answer. Disney. You know how I know? Because you named your daughter... Alice. Daisy Duck, Alice in Wonderland. Am I right? Please don't. I'll tell you whatever you wanna know. - Oh, I know. - Please don't hurt him. Who do you work for? Charlie. - Charlie Baudelaire. - Wrong answer. I know how you feel, but life is like this sometimes. He was an escaped convict, wanted by the authorities, of no use to me. Like a wounded animal who no longer has a purpose. You, on the other hand... are a pet with a new master. There's no need for me to threaten your daughter's life, now. You know that I will kill her if you do not do as I say. You will return home. You will not mention a word of this. You will collect the money from Charlie, and you will await my instructions. My question was simple. Who do you work for? And the right answer, Jett... is that as of today, you work for me.
