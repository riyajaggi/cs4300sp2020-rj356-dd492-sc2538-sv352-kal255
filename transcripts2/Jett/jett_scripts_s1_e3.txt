 I'm sorry, Jett. Close the fucking door. Put it down! Down on the ground. Give me your phone. - Who is it? - It's Scully. - Hello? - It's me. I won't be home for a couple days. Okay? - Okay. - Are you awake? - Are you gonna remember this? - No... Yes. Give Alice a kiss for me. Tell her I had to go out of town for work. Okay. Daisy. Be careful.

 I will. - Good having you back. - I'm not. Hey, this is Phoenix. Leave your name and number. Slowly. And I'll call you back. I'm coming over. Make sure you're alone. What are you doing here? - You're not happy to see me? - No. - I was worried about you. - How did you get in? You can't be here. I left you messages, you didn't call me back. Because I don't wanna talk to you. Well, everything can't be on your terms, okay? - I am tired, Dwight. - Are you? - Yes. - Why is that? Where were you? Okay. You know what? Go. Right now.

 I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - I was just worried about you. - You already said that. Yeah, well it's true. You have no right to worry about me anymore. Rosie, I don't wanna lose you. Where did you go? - I went dancing. - You don't like dancing. I'm gonna call the cops. Good idea. You gonna call Stevie. Or Bud. Call Ralphie, he's a lieutenant now, I have his number. What I do is none of your business. You gotta let me go. It's none of my business that my wife goes out dressed like a whore? We're still married legally. Good times and bad. Sickness and health. - Look what you made me do. - Fuck you. Fuck me? That's not how my wife talks. - Why are you provoking me? - Dwight, get the fuck off me. You should be apologizing, be thankful for a change. - This is Bennie. - Hey man, where you at? - Why? We meeting someplace? - No, but we got a big day tomorrow. I just wanna make sure you get your beauty rest. - Worried about you, man. - You're worried about me? I'm not the one out there stalking some chick we kidnapped when I should be at home sleeping. Christ almighty, you need to get a life. I'm not gonna honor that with a reply. You're outside her house right this minute, aren't you? So what? - You want some advice, gratis? - No. You're gonna get busted, okay? She's gonna recognize your voice, she's gonna recognize your face. I'll see you in the morning, Carl. Good night, Rosalie. - You all right? - No. - You do look a little pale. - I'm gonna pass out any minute. - All right. You need a drink? - After. - How'd you get here? - I'm clean. Sorry. - What's in that coat? - Trouble. Don't look. - Did you get shot? - What do you think? I think I'm gonna need that drink. - God, I hate that smell. - You are such a pussy. - What the fuck is your problem? - This ass-wipe talking to me? Yeah, I'm talking to you, fuck-head. Hands against the wall! You lost a chunk of your deltoid muscle, but it didn't touch bone. Two inches higher would've been your subclavian artery. Now, that's no fun at all. Shirley! That guy that came... That is not your business. - Well, aren't you a pretty sight? - Slicker than a honeymoon prick. What're you flexing? What're you flexing for? You think you're immune to my rules. I think you guys have been watching too many movies. Oh, she's funny. I love funny people. Stop. Stop. Tranquila. I've tussled with big bad bitches before. Convinced they're free to do whatever the fuck they want, without any consequences. Except, I think it's safe to say, usually they are actually, big bad bitches, like Mariposa here. Not skinny little white rat shits like you. So, today, we are gonna get you acclimated to how things work around here. No! No! You don't quit kicking like a mule, that handle's gonna break deep in your ass. - No! - Not gonna lie... You won't walk right for a few weeks. Don't fight it. You're gonna pass out but you're not gonna die. Keep pinching the vein. Get to the infirmary within five minutes. Anybody hears about this, you're the one I kill. Understood? You okay? Get your clothes on. You're not worried they'll come after you? I don't know how this works but, I mean, I have an idea. I look dumb but I grew up in this rough part of Rotterdam and I've dealt with some heavy shit before. I know how that sounds but it's true. I'm not just some dipshit tweaker who sucks dick to fund a habit. I actually did real well in high school and I read books and, you know, my mom was a nurse. I took some classes, I rode with EMT's. Like, I learned all sorts of things, like how an untreated ruptured colon, which is most likely what I would have right now if not for you, can kill you. Other fun facts, too. For example... Hanging yourself with a guitar string is a really bad way to kill yourself. I saw this guy who tried it and first the string cut through his trachea but it didn't kill him so he started fighting it and that severed his carotid artery and followed the angle of the jaw cutting everything along the way all the way to the temporal bone and still it took a while for him to die. Air embolism. I also learned that what you see in movies, when someone gets shot and everybody rushes to take the bullet out? Worst idea. What's important is to clean the wound and repair the damage. Taking the bullet out is the least important thing as it may be acting as a sterilizer for the wound. You don't talk much, do you? You don't talk at all. You're like a mute fucking avenger. All I'm saying is, if there is anything you need from me, ever, you just name it. Hey. - What's that? - Poison. So I can steal those gold bricks you brought with you. It's four times a day. Don't skimp. - What did I ask you not to do? - You told me not to look. But, what you meant was: one, don't be an asshole, two, don't steal them. Three, don't tell my brother. And four, be cool. And that's what I'm doing. And I googled going rates. Four-and-a-half kilogram bars sell for between 180 and 200 thousand. - Do you have a buyer? - Little out of your league, no? You need to fence them? Look, I know people different from the ones you do. And maybe you don't want to go to your regular contacts, seeing as how, clearly, the job went a little sour. - How's that guy doing? Did he make it? - You don't want to get involved in this. Whose bed are you sleeping in? - What would you want out of it? - Nothing. Nobody wants nothing. Well, that's my problem. Not enough ambition. Dinner. Too good to be true. That's me in a nutshell. Not enough ambition and too good to be true. - What does that make me? - A liability. No. It makes me a hooker with a heart of... - A heart of... - Get out of my face. Oh, my... You suck ass at gratitude. Hold on. Are you fixing my hair? It's just astray, mister. Don't wanna blow your cover. - What is it again, Bobby? - Bobby Larcum. - Mr. and Mrs. Castillo? - Please, call me Tiffany. - You must be Bobby. - I am, come on in. So... Kitchen... I love those high ceilings. Great light. - Isn't it? - Yeah. Take a look at this. Boss? Just three minutes, sir. We can do 2025 first and come back if you need a moment. - Do not wake her up. - She won't even know we're there. I'm counting on it. Thank you. Nice tub. Which side do you want? This is what it would feel like to brush our teeth next to each other. I could take a shower while you soak in the bath. I would get out and towel off just enough and sit right here and welcome you with open legs. We're on the clock, detective. I could say, "How about we skip TV tonight?" "I don't really care that much about dare devil chefs." To which I'd say, "If we don't watch home remodeling show, we'll never learn" "about those combination storm windows with the built-in screens." To which I'd say, "Why don't you flip me over the bed..." What do you guys think? - What are those specs again? - The seller is very motivated. - As are we. - Let me show you something else. Well, thanks for coming, guys. Bobby, let us drink a bunch of rose, and discussing this. - We'll get right back to you. - Sounds like a plan. Tiffany. Jack. It's been a real pleasure, take care. It's all you. What if he notices the software? What if we get this officially sanctioned by Carter? - When did you become such a smartass? - I learn from the best. There he is. "CB". Our homicidal gangster likes to text. - How long do you think? - Could be 15 minutes. Tiffany? It's what I wanted to be called when I was little. Hang on. Come here. So, be flustered, but not too flustered. - I'm such an idiot. - It was on the counter. Jack almost killed me. I am always losing my phone. Oh, I'm the worst. Anyway, he's back at the restaurant waiting. - Okay. - You haven't sold it yet, have you? No. But, another couple just left and they seemed serious. - Motivated? - Very motivated. - Call me if you have any questions. - Thanks. See you. - Right up there. - This is where you live? I'll see you around. It'll be sore for a couple of weeks. Main thing is for it not to get infected, so keep taking the antibiotics. Will do, doc. - You can keep that, return it later. - I don't have to. It's my good luck hoodie. I'm done using. Okay. The only reason I even have needles and a kit at home is because some of the girls I work with needed medical assistance and they can't afford a doctor so they all chipped in. It's important for me that you believe me. - Why? - Because I'm trying to change. I racked up a substantial tab when I was hooked on black tar. But once I'm paid up, I'm out. Wild guess: your brother's handling your loan repayment. I'm not asking you to understand I just... I wanted you to know that I don't get high anymore. What are you gonna do? - About what? - When you're out of debt. I wanna go back to school. - You're inscrutable. - What? Nothing. Maria? Welcome back. What'd I miss? - This was yesterday. - Did Alice see him? How long is he going to keep coming around? I'm working on it. What did your doctor say? Humor me. Said that the bill can easily run into several hundred thousands and suggested other facilities with lower costs because self-pay patients are a risk for them. - No. - I told them I have the money. - You do. - But I can't have you worrying. - No point worrying. - That would be a waste of energy. I'm not worried about you if you're not worried about me. Good. - You okay? - Peachy. You know how busy pedophiles are in jail? - Ms. Kowalski. You had us all worried. - I'm fine. Thanks for your concern. It's not your wellbeing he's worried about. How about you? What are you worried about? Now that you're here, I have one less worry. - Why's that? - We weren't sure if you and Blair were in on this together. In what world does that even make sense? Two crew members, knew each other from before. The entire score is missing along with the two crew members who knew each other. Makes you wonder. You're putting me on, right? You picked Blair, not me. - Very convenient for you. - Fuck you. - When was the last time you got shot? - I've been shot before, rest assured. Get the surveillance tapes and look at them. If you still think I'm in on this after you see them... I've seen them. A friend in the force pulled them out of evidence. Well then you know how badly you fucked up. You hired a spidermonkey on crack to handle a lot more than you said we were gonna handle. I wasn't allowed to tell you about the gold. - Why? - I follow my boss' instructions. Sometimes we don't see eye to eye. Let me show you something. Would you mind sitting up front with me? Actually, I would. I prefer the unobstructed view of the back of your head. Suit yourself. So after you left, Blair shot a guard, he's dead. It was a big mess. These two made it out, but we felt they could no longer be trusted. So now Blair is in the wind with the 250 and the ten bricks. In order for you to get back into good graces with Mr. Bestic, he asks that you find Blair and retrieve the score. And if I can't? Want a ride to your daughter's school or to your house? Aretha, Marvin Gaye, Al Green... What? Who would put Minnie Riperton next to Donny Hathaway? Julio Iglesias? What the fuck? Next to Curtis Mayfield? - Who is it? - Boss, it's me. Come in. - Come on. - Are you okay? Some illiterate elf has been sneaking in here at night and moving shit around so now the S's somehow include The Staple Singers, The Stylistics, The Supremes, and The Delphonics? And the P's go: Parliament, The Persuaders, Wilson Pickett and The Chi-Lites? The O'Jays next to Gladys Knight, the Isley Brothers tucked in to the Smokey Robinson section and Dee Dee Warwick next to Eddie Kendricks. - Man, I love Dee Dee Warwick. - Yeah. What's not to love? But that's not the point. And then I found this. That witch smuggled this in here and she put it next to Curtis Mayfield. - I can see why you're upset. - Yeah, God damn straight I'm upset. - How'd everything go? - He'd have to be blind to miss it. I'm not a fan of involving somebody's mother, but these God damn farmers are religious. They won't drink. They won't fuck a whore. Money is all they care about, and this guy, he only reason he's up here is to care for his mother post surgery. When I was younger, I would've killed the bitch. Charlie! You're not smoking in the house, are you? No! But power is as much about psychology as it is about bullets. Let's see how it shakes out. So Colin was like... Can I help you with something? You know where I can score some more of this? - Get the fuck gone, bitch. - Ease up, I'm not a cop. I'm looking for someone to sell me some. - Would that be you? - Ma'am. Honest to God, you gotta get the fuck out of here before you get hurt. Tell you what, you don't call me ma'am, I don't call you Limp Dick. What the fuck? What? Do you wanna find out how limp my dick is? Sure. - Shit fool. She outplayed you. - Okay, okay, we'll start again. And if you still want my dick after we're done talking, I'll take you to my place. - I'm Orlando. You can call me O. - Hi. - This is Slim. And your name is? - Not important, Orlando. You strike me as somebody who knows everything that goes on around here. Am I right? You know Blair in 307? Skinny guy, nervous like a bitch, always fixing his hair. - And what is he to you? - He's my ex. What? What the fuck? You were making time with that deadbeat? - Yeah, we all make mistakes. - Oh, my God. I guarantee you a better time than that guy. I don't doubt it. Seen him lately? No, I ain't seen him for like, a couple days. Ever see him with anyone? - Like a girl? - Sure. Anyone. No. He ain't been here longer than three months. He just keeps to himself. - Seriously, what's your name? - Shardene. - That's hilarious. - Thanks anyway, O. Were you serious about wanting to buy some ice, or what? How much? Careful with this, okay? We saw him with some dude in a wheel chair. - You remember Frank Sweeney? - Sure. Yeah, he's in a wheel chair now. Shitting in a bag, the rest of his life. You sure about that? Yeah, it was real high-tech, too. The wheelchair. - It's like his dad or something? - When was this? Last week. Blair was like, being all respectful. Kissing his ass. Yo, Shardene. What about my dick? No objects of any kind is to pass between you and the inmate, counsel. Not even a cookie. You need Mr. Carlyle to sign for something you call one of us. I must be the luckiest guy in the whole fucking world. Come on, a celebrity hard timer such as yourself? You get lots of visitors. There's none that look like you, Jett. How is the free world? Still nothing free about it, Mr. Carlyle. - How are you doing? - Catching up on my reading. Turns out the Russians were pretty good. - The French, overrated. - You're staying? - I got six more years. - Wasn't my question. I'm too old to pull a crazy stunt like that. No, I'm okay. Give talks AA meetings on self-respect and how to stay alive in this place without taking too much shit. It's all I can do for the fish, you know. The basics. - If you see it coming... - Hit first with something heavy. - If you don't see it coming... - You're fucked. You know the drill. You ever miss the girls with their razor blades and their shanks - stuck in their toothbrush handles? - Not so much. What can I do for you? Miljan Bestic. - Never heard the name. - I met him in Cuba. Lawyer of some kind. - Anything else? - He's dead. Just doesn't know it yet. Don't tell me unless you want to. I got caught in a situation with my pants down. Charlie's son, Junior, set me up. I don't know if or how much Charlie knows, I don't know what the game is. Make no mistake, rattling Charlie's cage is suicidal. No matter how much his power's diminished. And he loves that screwed up kid of his. That's his weakness. - You ever meet Ray Brewer? - Don't believe I have. He's a lawyer, well he's not exactly a lawyer, works for my lawyer's firm. I'll find out what I can about Bestic and I'll get word to you through him. I appreciate it. You know if I could I'd give you a great big wet kiss, Jett. You are an inspiration to men everywhere. I was beginning to think you weren't going to show. Sorry. - I have a favor to ask. - Ask. - I need to find Frank Sweeney. - What's this about? Doesn't involve Charlie or Junior. This is personal. Not very smart, coming to me for that kind of intel. Who says I'm smart? I'll see what I can do. What do you have for me? Nothing right now. Then I have a favor to ask you in return. - Ask. - There was a robbery at the Savoy Club out in Lynnville last week. Know anything about it? - No. You working robberies now? - There was a woman involved. Unfortunately the surveillance tapes have been misplaced. - You guys need to hire better help. - Josie thinks it's you. Josie feels threatened by me. How'd you manage to come without her today? I explained to her you might feel more comfortable talking just to me. Didn't like that one bit, I bet. How's it working out with the two of you? Fine. Some days better than others. - Why is that funny? - Just you. Okay. I wish you'd go away and come back ten years ago. Call me when you find Frank. - Hi, mom. - Hi, monkey. How was your bath? - It was hot. But Maria says it wasn't. - It was not hot. She says it's lukewarm. But that is a load of crap. - What did you say? - A load of crap! What's with this language? - Sara says that all the time. - Who's Sara? She's a girl who... Well, first I thought she was a boy. But, she's a girl. Will you read me a story? Sure. "Once upon a time, in a far away kingdom," "there was a beautiful young girl named Olivia, who wished she could fly." - Who gave you this book? - Maria. She says it's okay. Keep reading. "'But only real princesses fly, ' said Mr. Horn, her imaginary unicorn." - What happened to his forehead? - He's a unicorn. "So every day, she would stare at the big sky" "and call out to Mr. Mingo, the pink flamingo." - What happened? - I got shot. - You got shot? - A shot. I got a shot. At the doctor's. - Did it hurt? - Still does. "What are you thinking about today, my pretty Olivia?" "Mr. Mingo the pink flamingo would ask." - I hate shots. - Yeah, me too. "And Olivia, wide-eyed and true would always reply," "I wish I could marry a prince so that one day I could fly." Oh, please don't stop. This is the best part. Count to 50. I'll be right back. Fifty? One, two, three... - Hi there. - Hey, Jett, how you doing tonight? - Just fine, you? - I'm good, good. Just checking up on me? Yeah, just making sure everything is good and also to let you know that I found that record we were talking about. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah, I have it in my hands right now. My Way, 1972. It's a French edition. Starts with that Paul Anka tune made famous by Frank Sinatra, ends with Here Comes the Sun, by George Harrison. But right here, on side one, track four, is Save Me, written by the late Aretha Franklin. I just wanted you to know. Well then, I'll consider myself invited to your hotel suite. Maybe next Thursday, if convenient for you? I think I can make that work. - Thank you for calling, Charlie. - Pleasure's all mine. - Good night. - Night. Daisy? Was it Charlie? I don't need details, but I need to know who I'm looking out for. Everybody. Always. You know that. - What happens if he finds out? - That's a big if. What if Bestic simply kills you after this job? - Sounds like you're asking for details. - I know what it sounds like. I can't go to Charlie about Cuba unless I know more about Bestic and I can't move against Bestic without any information. And Dillon? If the cops are sniffing around Junior, I need the cops on a short leash. What's happened? Why are you so agitated? - I'm not agitated. - You sound agitated. - Llike you're scared to death. - I'm not scared. I am reasonably afraid. Did the doctors say something else to you? They need to run more tests next week, but no, that's not it. So what has changed? You just said what I think you said? You have a point. Have you been having dreams again? - No. - Because they're only dreams. They don't mean anything. - Forget it. - We're gonna figure this out. - Get some sleep. - Yeah. I'm gonna sleep like a baby.
