 I love you. This was good, but I think we both know. Goodbye, Harry. Do you know what the Poles have got? Bicycles. You know what the Germans have got? Tanks. I'm very fond of your daughter. Keep Kasia safe. Promise me. Tato! You need to get out of Europe. That's not going to happen, Auntie Nancy.

 You might have a passion for me? I'm looking for your brother. If you find him before I do, will you tell him he's in trouble? I just wondered if you'd had any news from Harry. - He told me he loved me. - How very Harry of him. You're worth ten of them and that family. But you're not choosing which girl you love the most, you're choosing whether to save this girl's life or not. - I love you. - I love you, too. - I'm sorry! - Kasia...! Tell me you will take care of Jan. ♪ My baby don't care for shows ♪ ♪ My baby don't care for clothes ♪ ♪ My baby just cares for me ♪

Is that the traditional way in Poland? Jan won't be the only refugee. Not while Britain stands by and let the Nazis rampage over Europe! Is he Jewish? Catholic. I thought it was the Jews who were in trouble. Why isn't he Jewish? Would you like me to go back and exchange him? Warsaw is rubble. All of the children are in danger. That's why I had to do something. Even if I just help one. You're assuming he is going to stay here, are you? Surely nobody is better placed than you to recognise that I have no maternal instincts whatsoever. I have been summoned down to Whitehall tomorrow. I'll get my next posting then. And I can't think much beyond that, to be honest. Why him? Why this boy? I had no idea it would be such a problem to house a refugee here. My problem, Harry, is I know you're lying. I don't know why, and I don't know what about, but there is the unmistakable scent of a lie. You're mustard, ladies. No doubt about that. I'll be in touch. Well, are we in or not? Like I said, I'll be in touch. ENSA has very high standards. So do we. No, it's all right. Leave it. Let the man think. How did you get on, then? Turned out it was for ENSA, Dad. Oh. They go away and entertain the troops. Yeah, I know what they do. I just wondered why Connie had you auditioning for them, knowing that you can't do it, like. Well, I was thinking about that, and... I was thinking, you know, "Why not?" Why not? Here's one good reason why not right here. Either of you started to smoke? I'm dying for a fag. You didn't bring my overcoat, then? I'm joking. I smell like a wet dog. Don't flatter yourself. When are you in court, then? I'm not. You've been on remand for two weeks. They must have charged you with something. They were going to, but then I said I'd join up. The army? No. You'd have been better off in there. I won't actually be joining up, Dad. I'm a conscientious objector. Since when? About half an hour ago. I'll get you some leaflets, then. The German High Command has given Warsaw a peace proposal. If it doesn't surrender in the next 12 hours, then it will be bombed without mercy for the following 12. I remember with fondness my time in Warsaw, and, having witnessed the military might of the Germans first-hand, fear for Warsaw and the people I left behind. _ _ _ _ _ I need news from Warsaw. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ SCREAMING, GUNFIRE Argh! YELLING, KNOCKING CONTINUES Who lives here? Just me and my mother and my brother, Jan. No more men? _ What did she say about men? Stefan, my father, died at Danzig. I'm sorry. The grief, it has driven her mad. Where are you going? Anywhere the bombs aren't falling. The bombs... won't be falling by tomorrow. Warsaw has surrendered, and life will be... _ What did the old bitch say? I said... ...hell. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Out socialising for the evening, I see? I am going to see some old school friends. Of course you are. She came round. The factory girl. Said you hadn't written. I assumed you'd come to your senses. Clearly not. That was the blade he used, by the way. Your father. ♪ The moon above ♪ ♪ Is yours and mine ♪ ♪ The right to fall in love ♪ ♪ Is yours and mine ♪ ♪ The hope of finding the dream our hearts desire ♪ ♪ All this is yours and mine. ♪ I love you. I worried about you so much, and you didn't write. I should have written. I should have told you that I loved you... when you told me. Before you went away. - But you didn't. - No, I didn't. Maybe you should have asked me one more time. Yes. Maybe I should. Lois... - ...when I was away... - What? I know it's only been six months, but so much has changed. Not much has changed round here. Conflict's got a bit scarcer. - Booking's a bit more frequent. - You know what I mean. It's... The war, and me being in Poland... I don't know where I'm going to be next. So by everything, you meant you. You've changed. Your mother was right. My mother... What did my mother say? That you could never really want me. A girl like me. How could anyone not want you? Lois! We're on. Harry. Nice to see you back in one piece. I've got to go. See you after. I have to go down to London tomorrow. For my job. I'll call round when I get back. - We can talk properly then. - Lois! I'm coming! I'll tell you why the Germans are coming. They ain't fond of men that look like us. The sooner we get out, the better. You still here, Webster? I'm not going anywhere, Eddie. Then give me your American passport and I'll get out now. If there is going to be a war, France is going to need good surgeons so I can help. There's no if about it, son. I don't know who I am. Not yet. But I do know that everything that matters to me is here in the city. Including you. Especially you. Your timing truly stinks, Webster. I know. Is that your pacifist face? Might have to try a bit harder. You, too, if that's your happy face. I've got a shirt needs ironing, if you need to take your mind off Harry and that. Oh, come on, Lois, I was joking. He said he loved you, didn't he? That was before he went away. Yeah, and a bloke isn't going to say it more than once, Lois. Not unless he's feeling guilty. So... that's a good sign. If you think about it. Yeah, but it wasn't like before. - There was something. - He'd just be nervous. You know, he didn't write. Temper on you. Bloody hell, who wouldn't be... eh? Why are you sticking up for him? You don't even like him. I'm sticking up for you. Couldn't cope for a minute if you went wobbly. Neither could Dad. Course you could. Pair of you. You'd look after each other. Yeah, but you're the one who can get through to him, Lois. You're the one he needs. Me? I'm just a bloody nuisance. Warsaw is all but destroyed. Warsaw has surrendered and, with it, Poland has fallen. The might of the German army and air force has proved too much, as it may prove too much for any European neighbour that stands in its way. Before the British left Poland, I asked a diplomat how long he thought it would take for the country to be conquered. He thought six months at the very least. It has, in fact, taken the Germans a little over a month. We're late. - My late or your late? - Both. Walk around the block and come in after me. What? We can't be seen arriving together, Webster. Even you must know that. OK. OK. Set list. Carolina Moon, Night And Day, then finish on My Baby Just Cares For Me. Sure. - Which version? - What? My Baby Just Cares For Me. Will you be singing it from the guy's point of view or the girl's? Cos we'll have to change the words, depending on how the mood is taking you. And how is the mood taking you? - Is there something you want to say? - No. Nah, is there something you want to say? The broadcast for tomorrow, I have outlined what needs to change. You're censoring my story about fresh fish? We can't have you reporting that there's a carp shortage with Christmas on the way. The American people would think that the German people are demoralised. But you're happy for the world to hear about the persecution of Jews? Persecution? No. The Jewish question is a matter of national security. I think the American people will understand that. The bombing of Polish civilians? We are at war, Miss Campbell. When you say we do you mean Germany, or you and me? Good afternoon, Frau Campbell. Hilda. You got bigger! No school today? No, my papa says I am poorly. Hilda, kommst du rein, bitte. What do you think? - Ah, Miss Campbell. - Nancy, please. And Hilda's no bother. She's a delight. I'm sorry not to be polite but she's not well today. And the neighbours are gossips and informers. Sh. It's true, Nancy. All true! Claudia, you shouldn't encourage Hilda. Why not? She's a bright girl, aren't you, darling? I will tell you about the neighbours later, Nancy, over a tiny glass of Schnapps, perhaps? Or a large glass. Nancy could write about your laundry, Papa, and talk about it on the radio to America. Yes, bore the Americans into staying out of the war, perhaps. Hilda. Good afternoon, Frau Klopp. I knew you were naive, Chase, but I didn't regard you as stupid. I was clearly wrong. I married Kasia so she could get out when we did. So where is she? She refused to leave. Sent her brother in her place. I know you might say she was dropping a hint choosing German bombs over me and all that, but... Why didn't you just get yourself a local whore like the rest of us? We have done nothing for the Polish people. Nothing! The least we can do is protect the civilians who can't leave. Yes, and there is also, of course, the small matter of defeating Nazi Germany, but I'm sure the War Office would want to prioritise your love life. We abandoned all of Poland, not just Kasia. We haven't lifted a finger. And all this talking, this diplomacy, - what good did it do? - I'll be sure to pass on your feelings to Mr Chamberlain when I see him next. Now, in the meantime, if you could sign the necessary forms. Where are you sending me? I thought you were disillusioned with diplomacy. Italians are still in Warsaw. I could work with them. Don't you understand, Chase? You are not a translator any more. You are not even a civil servant. You are dismissed. Temperamentally unsuitable. Unstable. My secretary has your letter of resignation, so, if you'd just like to sign that, and we can put this whole sorry saga behind us. Mind your step. Cheerio. In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti. Amen. _ _ _ _ _ Are you Jewish? I'm Polish. Well, that's not what I asked, is it? I am Polish. Do you go with Poles or Jews, huh? - I don't know what you mean. - Hey. I've asked you a question, yeah? Huh? Let her go. She doesn't want to answer your question. Or perhaps she just thinks you're a virgin so you wouldn't really understand her answer. Excuse me, mate. Is this the conchie queue? All right, mucker. Stop shaking. I'm on your side. Coward's side more like. I'll fight, mate. I just won't fight for this shit. So, if you do want some, bring your dinner and let's get to it. - Please. This is hard enough as it is. - Yeah, not for me it isn't. Give it back! Hey! Behave yourselves. Could save your life, them things. My dad's going to save us all. He's going to fight. Oh, is he now? Well, he won't want you messing about with your gas mask, then, will he? Your hair still looks nice. I know you had it done for Harry coming back. So if you're going to go and see him again... Of course I'm going to see him again. Men don't know what to do. To find a way back, you have to go to them. And, when it's all sorted with Harry, you'll be all clear to join ENSA! You never give up, do you? No, and neither should you. This is our chance, Lois. We've got to take it. I don't know, Connie. I've got my dad and he's not well, and Tom, well, he's Tom. You can carry on making excuses, or you can do something for yourself for once. You know you want to. I'm afraid Harry isn't here. Oh, I see. Unless you are here to see the boy? What boy? I don't know what boys like. I've forgotten what Harry liked. Poor thing. So far from home. You have a generous disposition, Lois, clearly. Thank you. It wasn't a compliment. It was an ironic observation, as I seem to be the one gifted with the task for which I am extremely ill-equipped. Did Harry say why? I mean, I know it's bad for refugees everywhere over there, and we should all do our bit, but was it just Harry? Who took it upon himself to bring one home? It seems to be the case, yes, that he did rather more than "his bit", as you so elegantly put it. We need another edge. If we find an edge... Do you see? Like this. Like this. Do you see? That's it. Well done, "Jan." Jan. - Jan. - Oh, I see. Jan. Now I've learnt something, too, hey? He seems like a nice boy. He is. He's a very nice boy. He's clearly very fond of you. I stayed with his family when I first arrived. The father Stefan died in Danzig. The brother Gregor's been missing since. The sister stayed behind to look after Maria, her mother, so... I don't know if he's got any family left, to be honest. Lucky him. You aren't serious. Let's get out of here. I'm thinking I might go away, too. How? ENSA. Entertaining the troops and that. Doing my bit, you know. If our troops ever get out there and get stuck in. My dad says we wouldn't be so keen to talk about getting stuck in if we'd seen what it was actually like. Try telling that to the Poles. Sorry. He's your dad. It's all right. I'm like you. I want to do something. I want to do anything. I want to feel like I matter. You do matter. You do matter. Let's go somewhere. Drive somewhere. Anywhere. Are you all right? Yes. Are you? Strange, isn't it? Finally doing this. Yes. But nice. Nice, yes. Now we can stop pretending and get on with our lives. Lois? You were the first man I ever loved, Harry. First I ever kissed, so I wanted you to be the first, and you were, so... I don't think I understand. Are you saying that this is the end? For us? - After what we've just done? - Give the boy a coconut. I'm saying that what we've just done was the end. None of this makes sense. I don't know what you're saying. I gave you my heart, Harry! My fucking heart! And you betrayed me in the snap with some Polish knicker elastic. So please don't get confused about me giving you my virginity, because that was just something I had to get out of the way. - Lois... - "The sister"! What? The family you went to stay with. You told me all of their names apart from the sister. You couldn't bring yourself to say her name in front of me. You couldn't bring yourself to say her name. Where have you been? You look dishevelled. It's fair to say I'm thoroughly dishevelled. Not in a rakish way, you understand, like Clark Gable. Just grubby. Have you been drinking? Yes. I've been drinking to my brilliant future. Good. Because the sooner you get your next posting, the better. There is no next posting. I was asked to resign this morning. The Foreign Office saw through me. This is your career. This is everything! You can't have just thrown it away. I won't hear of it. I was always destined to disappoint you. I just got there a bit quicker than we both thought I would. Is this about that dreadful factory girl... Lois? - Is she your future now? - No. She's not. I will not allow you to fail. I will not allow you to wallow in self-pity, and I will not allow you to mock the chances life has given you, - that I've given you! - Thank you. For your unstinting support. - Sober up and shape up. - Any other words of wisdom and comfort? A keepsake, perhaps, that I could keep close to my heart? Or a letter from my dead father that you've been keeping for just such an occasion? You do not want anything your father would give you, believe me. Why not, Mother? Eh? Why not? You know very well why not. Stop being foolish and indulgent. It's ugly in a man of your age and will get you absolutely nowhere. I'm already absolutely nowhere! GUNFIRE, SCREAMING _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Defiant words from the mayor of Warsaw as he announced the city's surrender. In Berlin, the church bells are ringing, celebrating what they like to call their "counter attack" against Poland. On the streets, one question, What will Britain do next? To which I would add, "What will America do?" "What will America do?" - That wasn't in the agreed transcript. - What can I say? Sometimes I get carried away. Herr Roosevelt and the Jews might want war, but they aren't America. Can I come in? Yes. Hi. You don't have many things, do you? No. I travel light. Hilda. _ _ I am sorry, Nancy. You need to work and... No, no, no. _ We're going to see the new Emil Jannings film. You could come, too. _ I don't know. It would be nice. Well, I love Emil Jannings, and I loved him in The Blue Angel. And, yes, I would love to come. I'll bring the hip flask. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Is she all right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's all right. It's all right. - I'm going to get a doctor. - Oh, no, no, please! Nancy don't. Don't. It's all right. Shall I call the doctor while you settle her? No, no. There's no need for that. _ _ She was having a fit for a long time. - She was not having a fit! - You weren't there. _ _ I think you should call a doctor. We know what to do, Frau Campbell. Thank you. _ _ Where are you going to go, then? Anywhere there ain't queers. Got a bit of news for you there, friend. What's that lad got on you, eh? Why are you doing it? Does he need paying off, is that it? I thought they abolished slavery. I love him. And he loves me. He's got you brain washed, too, has he? Saying that stuff. You can't love a man. Not the way you mean. You just need to get out of Paris and get straightened out. I'm sorry, Eddie. I going to take my chances here. Coloured and queer with Nazis in charge. Good luck with those chances. Eddie. Could you just talk to me for five minutes? Not a chance, lad! The Navy? The bloody Navy? Can't even steer a pedalo. Well, at least it's not the Army, eh? And I'm not going to prison, so... I must be stupid. I thought you'd actually become a pacifist. Really believed in it. Yeah, I don't really believe in anything for long, Dad. And at least I'm fighting on the right side. At least give me that. Oh, everybody thinks that. Every war they ever fight. - Yeah, well, this one's different. - Every war's different. Until it's the same. Lois! Talk some sense into him, will you? Can't do that, Dad. I think he's right to join up. Well, at least he's getting out in the world. Yeah, to get shot or blown up, or do the same to other lads no older than him who have no more idea why they're fighting either. It's better than dying a long, slow death in bloody Longsight. Oh, you can say that, you haven't seen death. That's right. I haven't done anything! And that's why I'm... That's why what? That's why I'm joining up, too. That ENSA audition I told you about. I'm taking it. I can't stay here, Dad. I'm sorry. I thought you were a translator. I am, and the army intend to put my skills to good use. I'll be an officer. Stop right there while I hang the bunting. So where does the budgerigar come into it? Company for Jan while I'm away. I bought it... in a pub. Of course you did. So I have a budgerigar and Jan to look after while you just go like that. - I'm fighting for my country. - It's still running away. - From what? - You're like your Father. He ran away when things became troublesome. For God's sake. Can't you show some generosity to his memory at least? When all is said and done, the man is dead. Death is just another kind of running away in the end. Where are you off, then? Just Southport to begin with. Bright lights, eh? - Dad... - I know I've not been much of a Dad to you and our Tom, like. - No. - And, erm, I just, er... ...think... ...the least I can do is let you go, eh? At least I can do that. _ _ _
