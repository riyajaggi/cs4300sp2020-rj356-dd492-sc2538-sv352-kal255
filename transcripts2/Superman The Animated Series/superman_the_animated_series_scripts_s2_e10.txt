 Hey! You blind? "No electronic equipment." Your watch. You forgot to take it off. I guess I did. Sorry. Hey, Mr. Clean. Yo, Rapmaster Danny? Hey, stupid. I love a man who knows his limitations. -What are you listening to? -My Walkman. Sounded like Voodoo Connection. Oh, I'd sure like to hear a cut off of their new album. I don't think so. I'm not even supposed to be talking to you.

 Yeah? You're not even supposed to be listening to music, but you are. Wait, don't go. Talk to me. It's so boring in here, so lonely. I've been waiting for someone like you to come along. Someone to help me shake things up a little. What do you want me to do? How about a little music for Livewire? Just to get me in the mood. Sure. Why not? Thanks, Danny boy. That's all I needed. Hey, these batteries are dead. Let's see if they're rechargeable. Lights out. -Hey. -Hey, who was that? -You crazy? -Hey, look out!

 Later, chumps. And as I've told Superman, the S.C.U. will be mobilized within the hour... ...and ready to move out at a moment's notice. -Dan. -Hey, Turp. Inspector. Is the S.C.U. really prepared to deal with Livewire? If that short circuit shows her mug anywhere in this town... -...I will personally-- -Pucker up and plant a big wet one... ...right on her lips. What is that? -Oh, my God, it's her. -It's her, it's Livewire. Now, where's my real date? Looking for me, Livewire? Well-timed, Superjerk. Let's rock! You're just delaying the inevitable, Superman. What do you want? That's right. Let's get to the heart of the matter. I want justice. I want revenge. I want your life. Why won't you die? Not this time, Superjerk, but I'll be back... ...and next time, I'll find a way to take you out. Permanently. Okay, folks. Let's see if he'll-- By golly, he's really doing it. He's drinking milk out of his owner's mouth. Rudy. Is this the bone they threw you? A big TV? How would you like to have some real laughs? Poor little Parasite. I've been where you are. Locked away in a cell. All alone, no one to see. No one to touch... ...and all because of Superman. Superman. But we could take care of him, you and l. And then when we're done, maybe I'll give you a little taste... ...of my power, I mean. Yeah, sure. Whatever you say. -Oh, baby! -Hey, good-looking. -Come on to my house-- -Come to me, baby. Over here, come here, kid. I'm the one. Hi, boys. Wanna make sparks fly? -Zap me, honey. -Charge me up, baby. -Try me, Live. I'm battery-powered. -Right over here. -Right over here, kid. -Here, here. I just keep going and going and going.... What the--? Don't play with your food, now. -Do you know how to pilot one of those? -Not yet, but I'm a fast learner. -You know where to go. -Ain't you coming? I don't do boats. -Too loud for you? -No, it's just that every time... ...I see something electric, I keep thinking she's gonna pop out. That sounds like it's coming from Stryker's. I better find a phone. Here, we can use mine. Clark? Clark? Superman. Sorry, Rudy. I'm canceling your early release. Oh, no, you don't. Give it up, Rudy. You're only hurting yourself. So that's the plan, my purple people-eater. I force Superman into your grip, then you drain away his powers... ...Ieaving him just conscious enough to watch me deliver the final blow. You smell like fish. So? Hold your nose. You can look, but don't touch. Don't be afraid. I know how to control my power. That's what they all say. You stupid sleaze. I'm pure electricity, 186,000 miles per second. If I say no, it means no. Now, don't stay up too late, Rudster. Remember, we gotta stay charged for the S-man. How do you like this? The fun couple makes the front page even when they're lying low. How's it look out there? It's gonna get worse before it gets better. Well, I'm going over to S.C.U. Headquarters anyway. See if Maggie Sawyer can give me more than the official line. -Wanna come? -No, I think I'll just stay.... What? All right, maybe it's not the latest word in rainwear... ...but nothing beats a plain old plastic poncho. It won't take long for the cops to get here, even less for Blue Boy. Just enough time to juice up. Knock it off. Can't you see I'm eating? Look, Rudy. Dessert. Get him! Hey, he's covered. Well, what do you know? The boy scout brought protection. -That ain't fair. -I didn't realize there were rules. Tear it off. Rudy. The tank! Super sorbet. Do not use if plastic seal is broken. That's it. Drain him! Not too much, idiot. I want him left standing. I know what I'm doing. Yeah, Blue Boy, this has been a long time coming. Get ready to snap, crackle and pop. Hey, what do you think you're--? I want him alive so I can keep feeding off him, and you too. You've said no to me for the last time, baby. Oh, no, you don't. Hey, Superman, or should I call you Clark? I remember now. In fact, I remember everything about you. How's that pretty little colleague of yours? Lois, right? I was gonna do this nicely, but give him an inch.... The janitor's closet. A dead end, Superman. Believe me, I know. Oh, now I'm scared. No! You bungling idiot! We could have had it all. All. Look at me, you dolt. This is the face that's going to destroy you. You hear me, eggplant? Don't waste your breath, Sparky. Parasite don't even know who he is. It's a good bet he ain't gonna remember you. -Do you think he'll ever remember? -He's oatmeal. You need a lift? No, thanks. I'm feeling stronger, and it's a nice night for flying. [ENGLlSH] OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
