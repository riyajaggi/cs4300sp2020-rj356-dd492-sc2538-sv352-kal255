  [♪♪♪]  My name is Orion.  I fled from the fire-pits  of Apokolips to warn you. He's coming. SUPERMAN:   Who is?   Darkseid. He's already provided  human agents  with Apokoliptic weaponry. Maggie!  We're ready to begin  phase two, Mr. Mannheim.  You may use this to contact me   when you need further help.  Orion was right.

 It isn't over.  HAMILTON:   We've been monitoring   the hot zone by satellite.  The explosion triggered   a meltdown  in the power plant's   central reactor.  It's burning straight through   the substrata now.  And it will get hotter   and hotter  until it reaches   the Earth's core.  What then? As this simulation shows,   it will explode,  setting off a series   of violent eruptions  which will cover the earth   with more burn holes.  I've never seen anything   like it.  Yes, you have.  We all have.

 On Apokolips.  Your plan worked, Darkseid.  Earth is ours. Your enthusiasm is premature,   Kalibak.  Superman will still try   to resist me.  Then send me. I'm ready.  I'll crush him this time.  Don't remind me  of your ignominious defeat.  You'll stay at my side  where I can see you.  Father, please.  No! This prey requires   a more experienced hunter.  Steppenwolf. I look forward to adding   a new trophy to my collection.  The radioactive hole is now only  a few hundred meters deep.  But that's going to increase,   and quickly.  TURPIN:   Shouldn't you be paging your new best friend  the buckethead?  I was just thinking  about Orion.  What's the matter?  Fried.  Must have been   the pulse from the explosion.  We're on our own now.  If the reactor melts  through the top mantle,  we'll never stop it.  [♪♪♪]  [ENERGY CRACKLES] This will be good hunting.  You picked  the wrong time, pal.  Ah!  [CREATURES SNARLING]  Para-Demons, attack!  Argh!  [HORNS HONKING]  Jeez. We've got a meltdown   on Ayers Island,  a war  at Sinnott Air Force Base.  What next?   [GASPS]  Ah!  [SCREECHES]  Whoa.  This wasn't in the forecast.  [SCREAMS]  GIRL: Look at that, Mommy.  BOY: I know.  [GRUNTING]  GIRL:  Superman.  [GROANS]  Superman!  Now, to the kill.  [CROWD SCREAMING]  WOMAN:  Oh, my God!  No!  [GASPS]  Stop him!  [EXPLOSION]  Pull around for another shot.  This guy's about  to be an oil slick.  Looks like the big guy   could use a hand.  Giacoia, move in!  Come on. Thanks, inspector.  Hey, don't you have a fire   to put out?  [♪♪♪]  [PANTING]  You're a magnificent opponent,  Superman.  But even you must realize   it's hopeless.  Darkseid.  I could easily  destroy you now.  And once you're gone,  the pathetic beings   of this planet  won't have the will   to resist me.  The few who survive, that is.  [GROANING]  However, if you join me   as my loyal vassal,  I could guarantee   a modicum of restraint.  Think of it, Superman.  The power you have now,  it's nothing compared   with what I'm offering you.  You know   I can't do that. Pity.  Still,   if you won't be my knight,  you will be my pawn.  [SUPERMAN SCREAMS]  MAN:   Citizens are warned to stay   away from Metropolis Plaza,  where police are still trying   to contain the situation--  Gotta get down there. Whoa, cowgirl,  what are you gonna do?  Hold a gun in one hand  and your IV in the other?  --forces have been mobilized   and are en route to Metropolis. Dan.  Where's those choppers?   I need cover. Now!  [♪♪♪]  [PEOPLE SCREAMING]  Outstanding.  [GASPS]  [HISSES]  [SNARLS]  [WHIMPERING]  Thanks, inspector.  Get back!  What do you think  you're doin', kid? This ain't no stunt show. I'm with the Planet.  I'm their photographer.  That a fact?   Well, get ready to shoot.  Hey, you overgrown parakeets! Take a snort of this!  Royer, Colletta, cover me!  That's right, chief.  Turpin and his boys   are holding their own.  Maybe even more than that.  [BEEPS]  [CARS HONKING] [RUMBLING]  What is it?  It ain't no street sweeper. [CROWD SCREAMING]  What is that thing?  Oh, my Lord.  [WHIMPERS] [♪♪♪]  Holy Joe.  [GROANING]  Okay, back off. I get the point. People of Earth,  I am Darkseid,   lord of Apokolips.  Here is your savior,   cowed and broken.  I have crushed him   as easily as I have crushed  all who have dared to oppose me  throughout the cosmos.  I am power unlike   any you have known:  absolute, infinite   and unrelenting.  You have no choice  but to prepare for a long,   dark future as my subjects  and my slaves.  In a pig's eye!  [CROWD SHOUTING]  This is our world, ugly.  You won't get it   without a fight!  You hear that, Darkseid?  The people of Earth aren't like  your slaves on Apokolips.  They don't take kindly   to dictators.  If they resist, I will not   hesitate to destroy them.  You want a piece of me?   Come on! Come on, rockhead! [CROWD CHEERING] Jeez. Is he crazy? Yeah.  Don't they know this is suicide? Better a quick death in battle  than a slow one under your heel. Darkseid, we've detected  military aircraft  heading this way. I don't care how many crummy   planets you've conquered.  You ain't gettin' this one.  No!  [CROWD CHEERING]  That's one for the home team.  Let's finish it.  Very well.  This world dies now.  Darkseid.  High Father has decreed this  planet is under his protection.  Any further aggression   will breach the peace treaty  and be considered an act of war  against New Genesis itself.  The decision is yours, Darkseid. It is good to see you   after all these years, my son.  I've observed your boldness  and ferocity for some time  not without undue pride. Though you're misguided   in your loyalty,  I won't quibble  over this insignificant speck   in the universe.  I would hate to spoil   our reunion with bloodshed.  Return.  Go on, you mangy buzzards.  And don't come back. Savor your moment of triumph,   Superman.  But remember,   victory has its price.  [SCREAMS]  Dan!  [CROWD GASPS]  [GASPS]  Murderer!  [GROWLING]  [SCREAMS]  [YELLING]  [BLOWS THUDDING]  [SIGHS]  I'm sorry.  [SINGING IN HEBREW]  ♪ Amen ♪  Goodbye, old friend.  In the end, the world  didn't really need a super man,  just a brave one.  [♪♪♪]  [♪♪♪]
