  [♪♪♪]  [SEAGULLS CAWING]  [CROWD CHATTERING]  MAN: My name's on the list.   MAN 2: Let us in.  MAN 3: I'll pay you double.   WOMAN: Triple!  Behind the ropes, people. We have special tickets.  Hey! But I just gave you $100. Thank you.   Now get behind the rope.  MAN 4:   Serves him right. WOMAN:   Some people think

 they can buy anyone.  What do you think?  Uh, well, I, uh--   Oh, my.  I don't have a ticket. Always room for one more.  Thanks, skipper. Mwah.  Hey, what's she got  that I haven't got?  Everything.  [PIANO PLAYING PLEASANT MUSIC]  So, what do you think  this stuff's worth, Clark?  To the right collector?  Millions.  And my mom made me  throw out all my models.  [PEOPLE CHATTERING]

 Now, there's  a camera-friendly face.  Not exactly   newsworthy, Jim. This is for   my private collection.  I hope you   got my good side. Uh...  [CHUCKLES]  Ladies and gentlemen,   the regatta is about to begin.  [SQUEALS]  Out already?  Jeez.  [♪♪♪]  Fire!   Hey!  Somebody get some help!  [CROWD SCREAMING]  Come on, Jimmy.  Time to go.  [COUGHING]  Clark! Clark!  Where are you? [♪♪♪]  [GASPING]  Let's go. Don't move. I'll get you.  [CINDERS CRACKLING]  Gone.  Like a puff of smoke.  MAN:  Move away  from the building, sir.  I'm a reporter.   I was just--  Sorry. My crew's cleaning   hazardous chemicals  from the interior.  You'll have to move back.  Hazardous chemicals? At a yacht club?  Fuel storage.   Petroleum, you know.  The Metropolis Yacht Club  is sail-power only.  There's no fuel   being stored there. I wanna see   what's going on. For your own safety...  I suggest you back off.  [♪♪♪]  Keisha, get me Kurt.  My tax dollars at work.  You're going to love  the merchandise, Donny.  And I'm offering it   to you first  'cause you're  my absolute favorite fence.  DONNY:   Newspaper said a bunch   of boat stuff was missing.  Please. Nautical memorabilia.  Whatever it is,   I'm gonna have to pass.  Really?  [BLOWS WHISTLE]  The whistle was touched   by the president's lips.  What wasn't?  Uh-- Donny, I can give you   a really good price.  I have to get out of town.  Look, Volcana, honey,   I'd love to help you,  but I can't move   that kind of stuff.  Don't you have anything else?  I might.  Yeah? When?  Tuesday.   Meet me at the usual place.  You won't be sorry.  [GASPS]  [♪♪♪]  Where exactly   is "the usual place"?  [♪♪♪]  [WOMAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY   OVER P.A.]  We opened the institute  about 20 years ago.  It was the first school   to offer paranormal children  a place where they could fit in. And you also help them   develop their abilities?  Let me show you.  Like most things, telekinesis takes practice.  This little girl had   a 40-percent accuracy rating  when she got here.  Now it's up to 92. Impressive. But tell me something. Who pays for all this? I-- I thought   you were doing a story  about paranormals.  Just trying   to be thorough. Where does   your funding come from? Why, we have donors and...  The government?  [SIGHS]  Mr. Kent, we do  some very worthwhile work here,  and the government gives us  considerable...encouragement.  But if the public at large knew  that this was how some of  their taxes were being spent--  They wouldn't understand. Exactly.  Keep working, Billy.  It'll come.  Ever have anyone who exhibited   pyrokinetic abilities?  Py-- Pyrokinesis? You know, the ability  to start and control fires.  Oh, dear.   Look at the time.  You haven't answered   my question.  I have another appointment.   Billy will show you out.  I knew he was gonna do that.  MAN:   Now, that went well. I'm doing the best I can.  That's what we're afraid of. Wh--? Where are you taking me? A safe house.   For your own protection. Protection?  Protection from whom?  Just get in the car. [♪♪♪]  [GUNSHOT]  Hey!  [GUNSHOT]  Get down!  You see anyone? [GRUNTS]  Please, don't turn me in. You gonna tell me  what's going on?  You take me someplace safe,   and I'll tell you everything. Deal.  By the way, that was   a nice diversion tactic.  How'd you do it?  Uh, the tires?  A form of kinetic manipulation. As they say,   "I'm also a client."  [SLURPING]  It was about 10 years ago.  A teenaged girl named  Claire Selton came to us  with enormous  pyrokinetic potential.  But I never got to  see her fulfill it.  Why not?  The government men.   They took her.  Took her?  As in, kidnapped?  Mm-hm.  Can I have another?  What did they do with her? Stripped away her past,   code-named her "Volcana,"  and tried their hardest  to turn her   into a living weapon.  Poor kid.  Ah, don't feel  too sorry for her.  If this is the same person   we're talking about,  she could give  as good as she got.  [SLURPING]  Ahhh.  This is almost   paranormally good.  [LAUGHS]  I-- Paranormal.  That's-- That's really good.  [♪♪♪]  Uh, I have an errand   I need to run.  Oh, don't worry about me.  [SLURPING]  I'll be fine.  [BURPS]  Life, liberty  and the pursuit of my happiness. You're gonna make me earn this,  aren't you?  Don't do it, Volcana.  I can help you.  No, thanks. These days,   I help myself. Listen, nobody will blame you   for what you've done.  But the stealing  has to stop. Now.  Stop?   I'm just getting warmed up. Aah!  [♪♪♪]  [GASPS]  You have to trust me,   Volcana.  Do you know how many times  I've heard that?  From my parents  before they shuffled me off  to the institute?  From the institute just before  they turned me over to the feds. And from the government just before   they took away my life!  And that was with my left hand.  [PEOPLE SCREAMING]  [♪♪♪]  Look. Amazing. WOMAN:   What was that?  Donny,  I've got something for you.  It wasn't what I originally   hoped for but--  I guess I always knew   you'd catch up to me, Kurt. Now leave, before I make it  even hotter for you.  You've been bad, Volcana.  You've been worse. And now that we've recapped  the past two years--  You shouldn't have left us.  I don't like being used. All for a good cause.  I'll be the judge  of that.  And if you're thinking you can  make me go back, forget it.  Now, that's where you're wrong.  [♪♪♪]  Aah!  You see, we've had two years  to think about...how to do it.  [♪♪♪]  [HORNS HONKING IN DISTANCE]  So I see cop cars   outside this hotel. Desk clerk tells me she heard   some kind of struggle  in a room she rented   to a redhead.  You call that a story? Here's the weird part:  The room was covered in foam.  The police say it's  a powerful fire retardant,  but get this:  There was no fire.  Oh, now, that's a headline. LOIS:   "No Fire in Hotel Room."  [♪♪♪]  Shred 'em.  And then we're outta here.  Hey!   Hey!  Where did they take her?  [ENERGY SURGING] It's a G-40 blue laser, alien. One shot can penetrate five feet of tempered steel  in 0.3 seconds.  I don't think even-- Argh!  I repeat:  Where did they take her?  [WHIMPERING]  [♪♪♪]  KURT:   No escape, Volcana.  The tank is filled  with an inert gas. The breathing mask   is your only source of oxygen. Not enough   for you to start a fire. And should you try... [COUGHING]  I wouldn't give us any trouble.  Understood?  [PANTING OVER SPEAKER]  Okay, you win.  Who do you want me to kill?  My dear, you can't believe  we'd trust you   with another assignment.  However, it did cost us  a lot of money  to develop your talents, and we'd like   to get some of it back. How?  A foreign government  doing metagenetic experiments   wants to study you.  You mean dissect me. Probably.  When they're done playing.  [WHIRRING] Superman.  Just in time.  [GUNS COCKING]  Really?  You can see  we've shut down Volcana.  As you know,  she's a real loose cannon.  You're the loose cannon. You and your entire operation. Your friends told me   Project Firestorm's funding  was cut off years ago.  This isn't the government.   It's just you.  [♪♪♪]  Yes.  MAN:  Move it! Move it!  [ALL YELLING]  Thanks.  Don't get sentimental.   It's a one-time thing.  [♪♪♪]  [GASPS]  Shoe's on the other foot,  eh, lover?  Volcana, please.  SUPERMAN:   Volcana, no. Let the courts deal with him. You'll understand   if I'm a little skeptical  about the justice system.  [GASPS]  I prefer my own justice.  And if you're not part   of my solution...  ...you're part of my problem.  No!  Hey, I told you last time.   I like chunky.  Adapt.  Food, shelter, sunshine...  Could be worse.  Could be Metropolis  Women's Prison  if you weren't so volatile. Polite to the end.  Your mother raised you well.  I was lucky.  Yes, you were.  I hope you'll think of me.  Especially on   those cold Metropolis nights.  Don't you ever cool down? No.  [♪♪♪] OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
