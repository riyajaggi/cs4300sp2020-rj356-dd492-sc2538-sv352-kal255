  [♪♪♪]  NARRATOR:   Previously on Superman:  There's nothing out there   but death.  A distress signal  coming from the edge  of the system.  I'm too late.  [MACHINES BEEPING]  Maybe not.  Yeah, I saw on TV   that Intergang's back. Oh, yeah?  MARTHA:   They're a bunch of hoodlums

 with terrible weapons.  Don't even blink.  Children,   defend your granny's honor.  A super...girl?  You called, Granny?  GRANNY:   Girls, this ninny noodle  wants to play rough.  Make her last moments special.  [♪♪♪]  Lashina.   Stompa.  Mad Harriet.  Tear them apart!  Run, Jimmy!  [SHRIEKS]

 Aw, poor baby.  Let me kiss it  and make it worse.  Ew!  Hands off, gruesome. Pity we have to kill  the little dumpling. She'd be perfect   for my Female Furies. After a little brain surgery.  Aah!  [BOTH SCREAMING]  Nice teamwork, ladies.  Don't just stand there,   you ninny doodles.  Finish her!  [CHATTERING]  Hey! We can't   let them do that. Are you nuts?  She's dog meat.  And so are we,  if we stick around here.  Come on, Amy.  But what about  Supergirl?  What about her?  I'm outta here.  [GROANING]  [♪♪♪]  That's it, girlie.  Now I'm gonna   have to put my foot down.  Aah!  MAN:   So we can expect   to see quite a display  from Fleischer's Comet   as it passes our orbit.  Not too close, I hope.  Well, two-and-a-half  million miles or so. Quite close   in astronomical terms,  but not close enough   to threaten.  [RUMBLING, PEOPLE SCREAM]  An earthquake   in Metropolis?  MAN:  Run! Move it!  Sorry, doc,  looks like your comet  just got bumped  off the front page.  Right, Clark? Clark?  Heads up, and off.  [ALL GASP]  Kara, I thought I told you   to stay out of trouble.  Who, me?  I'm not in trouble. And by the way,  it's Supergirl. See? Super...girl. Right.  Hello, big boy.  Come to help your little friend? Ain't that a kick.  Superman! Aah!  [♪♪♪]  Aah!  [SCREAMS]  Stop, or I'll fire!  Play with fire,   and you might get burned. [LAUGHS]  Can I cook,   or can I cook?  [ALL LAUGHING]  Well done, my darlings.  He'll make an excellent toy   for the master.  Take him now.  Drat.   I'm such an old pudding head.  Where did I put   my Boom Tube controller?  Allow me, Granny. Thank you, kitten.  Bless you.  Oh, no.  GRANNY:   Good morning, sunshine.  Where's Supergirl?  Still on that mud-ball planet  of yours.  We throw   the small ones back.  [ALL LAUGHING]  What do you want?  No time for idle chatter,   pumpkin.  We've got to get you ready  to meet the master.  Lovely.  [YELLING]  AMY:   I still can't believe   that Granny and all this stuff  are from another planet.  I'm from another planet.  It happens.  Hey, isn't this what brought   that traveling freak show here? Looks like it.  It opens those Boom Tubes  to Apokolips.  If that's   where Superman is, that's where I'm going.  Supergirl, wait. Good luck. Thanks.  I'm gonna need it.  [♪♪♪]  [♪♪♪]  [BEEPS]  What a toilet.  Yow!  Wouldn't wanna meet him  in a dark alley.  [MACHINE WHIRRING]  [♪♪♪]  [ANIMAL GROWLING]  Oi! Got something there, boy?  [BARKING]  [♪♪♪]  [SCREECHING IN DISTANCE]  [♪♪♪]  Oh, great.  Uh, listen.  Um, Amy, I just wanted   to say thanks.  You know,  for helping out.  Well, I helped  make this mess. I figure I should   try to square things. What was Granny  doing here, anyway?  What did she want   with you guys?  She was always sending us out  to get electronics and stuff. So what did she do   with it all?  There's gotta  be more than this.  You know,   there's a room in back she always kept locked. Bingo.  [♪♪♪]  [GASPS]  Geez.  Granny's been busy. [♪♪♪]  Aah!  Yes!  [PANTING]  [HORN BLARES]  [GRUNTING]  Dance, monkey-boy,  dance.  Show a little more spirit. The master awaits you.  Hang on, Clark.  [CONTINUES GRUNTING]  Kneel before   Lord Darkseid.  I said, kneel,   you big meatloaf. Ever proud,   eh, Kryptonian? I must say,   I find it wearying. What was this bootlicker  doing on Earth, Darkseid?  I thought your business there   was settled.  I never settle.  What I cannot have, I destroy.  If you attack Earth,  it'll be a breach  of your treaty with New Genesis. I am well aware  of our agreement.  However, if the Earth  were to be destroyed by a natural disaster, say... a stray comet...  well, then I could not   be held accountable.  That comet isn't coming   anywhere near Earth.  It will now, pork chop. Thanks to my darling  Doomsday Magnet,  which I built   on Earth myself. An old lady   needs her hobbies. [MACHINE BEEPING]  What are you  looking at? It's some kind  of clock mechanism.  [BEEPING]  Don't look at me.   I didn't touch anything. [ENERGY SURGING]  Uh-oh.  This is not good. Definitely not good.  What are you doing? Making up for past mistakes.  Aah!  Where's a superhero   when you need him?  DARKSEID:   The die is cast. Within the hour, the comet will collide with your paltry planet. The impact  will create a dark cloud  that will cover the world,   snuffing out all life.  Ooh, the devastation.  Can you just picture it?  SUPERGIRL:  I can.  [♪♪♪]  I've seen one planet die, and I'm not gonna stand by  and watch it happen again. Noble sentiments, my dear.  Aah!  Kara!  [♪♪♪]  [GRUNTING]  No.  Darkseid!  Aah!  You've got a lot of guts  coming here, blondie.  And we're gonna   spread 'em all over Apokolips. [GRUNTING]  [♪♪♪]  [GROWLS]  [SCREAMING]  Okay, sugar. The main event.  [BOTH GRUNTING]  [♪♪♪]  DARKSEID:   Most impressive... but ultimately futile.  There is no escape.  Maybe. Maybe not.  Superman!  The Doomsday Magnet.  JIMMY:  You know what this is?  Yeah, it's scrap metal.  Supergirl, don't--  Some fireworks, huh? Now, what'd I do wrong? I might have been able   to use the magnet  to repel the comet   back into space.  Oops.  Now I'll have to do it   the hard way.  Wait!  It's entering their atmosphere.  Nothing can stop it now, master. Nothing!  [♪♪♪]  Stay back.   I'm gonna try to deflect it. [♪♪♪]  [GRUNTING]  [GASPS]  Well, girl, you always wanted   to save the world.  [♪♪♪]  Kara!  Awesome.  Oh, great  and powerful Darkseid, I...  Furies, teach Granny   the price of failure.  No, my precious girls.  Don't!  Don't hurt your beloved Granny. GRANNY [SCREAMING]:   No!  [♪♪♪]  You keep staring at your byline,  you'll burn a hole in it.  What?   Oh, uh, heh. Yeah.  It just looks so...good.  It's a big story.  You should be proud.  So tell us, Jimbo,   is she as cute as her picture?  See for yourself.  All right!  There she is. Hey.  [♪♪♪]  That reminds me, Jimmy.  My cousin's in town,  and something tells me  you two would hit it off   just fine.  [♪♪♪]  [♪♪♪]
