  [♪♪♪]  [♪♪♪]  Sawyer. Special Crimes Unit.  [BEEPS]  [TRUCK DOORS CLOSE]  A late-night   deposit, inspector? Yeah, some   freshly laundered money we swept up   in our latest raid. Won't those Intergang bums   ever learn Turpin's first law?  You play in my backyard,  you play by my rules.

 Modest, isn't he? [LOUD BOOM] Please tell me  that's thunder.  Afraid not. I guess they think   they can change the rules.  [ALL YELL]  This is Sawyer.   All units.  We need backup, now.  [GASPS]  [GRUNTS]  Maggie!  [GRUNTING]  Come back, you murdering scum!  Come back!  It would serve him right  if we did come back.

 THUG 1:   Look out!  [BOTH GRUNTING]  Fire the nova bomb.  Hurry!  [GRUNTING]  Fire!  [EMITTING  HIGH-PITCHED NOISE]  [GROANING]  [GROANING]  [GROANING]  [SIRENS WAILING  IN DISTANCE]  [PEOPLE MURMURING, MOANING]  [WOMAN WEEPING]  [SIRENS  GROWING LOUDER]  You shouldn't   stay long, Dan. She's still  very weak. Hi.  Hi, yourself.  Lying down on the job, huh?  Some days you're the windshield, and some days you're the bug.  Forget it. You'll be back  busting my chops in no time.  Any leads on the heist?  Got our best people   working on it.  I-- I mean, besides you.  [GROANING]  Maggie...I swear I'll find  those filthy creeps.  And when I do--  Dan, these aren't   simple street punks.  Punks are punks, Maggie.   I am gonna--!  No! Promise me you'll keep  that temper in check.  Promise. You got it.  Turpin's word.  I'm gonna hold you  to that, Dan,  because it's   all on you now. Yeah. I know.  MAN:   I tell you,  it was beautiful, Bruno.  We jacked the loot  and left Superman  kissing concrete.  A few more jobs like this,   and I'll own Metropolis.  [BEEPING]  Uh...I gotta take this call.  You heard me.  Out!  [BEEPING FASTER]  Darkseid.  We tried out the tank,  just like you said.  I did not return you to Earth  so you could indulge   in petty theft.  Petty?  We cleared   over 20 million!  I play for higher stakes.  Aah!  Do we understand  each other?  [GULPS]  Good. Serve me well, Mannheim,   and I'll make you a king.  [SIGHS]  [REPORTERS   CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY]  So you're saying   not even Superman  could stop   this thing?  I'm saying we can't   always expect one guy to save our sorry butts, even if   he is Superman. This time, we'll have to   tackle it ourselves.  Good luck.  [INDISTINCT CHATTER]  REPORTER 1: Hey, Turpin!  REPORTER 2:   Dan, Northstar Herald here.  [INDISTINCT CHATTER]  It almost looks...  alien.  Sure, Kent.  Maybe it was a Martian  strapped for cash.  MAN 1:   What is that?  MAN 2:   What's going on?  Let's get outta here!   WOMAN 1: Quick!  [CROWD YELLING]  Whoa!  [GROANING]  Superman!  Must warn...  Superman.  [GROANS]  SUPERMAN:   How's our mysterious   visitor doing, Emil?  His wounds are healing  at a phenomenal rate. He's fully conscious,   and in quite a rage to see-- Superman! Get me Superman!  Freeze, bucket-head!  One more move, and you're back  in intensive care.  Hold it,   inspector!  Everybody calm down.  I didn't fight my way through  a battalion of Parademons  to be told to calm down! And they say   I got a temper.  You have me  at a loss, Mr....  My name is Orion.  I fled from the fire-pits  of Apokolips to warn you. He's coming.  Who is?  Darkseid.  Mother Box can explain it  better than I.  She is a living computer   connected to the Source.  MOTHER BOX:   Let us begin at the beginning.  What once was whole   was split asunder.  And in its place,   there arose two worlds.  Worlds as different   as daylight and darkness,  virtue and evil.  One is called New Genesis.  Unparalleled in its beauty...  It is ruled by the wise   and powerful Highfather.  The other is Apokolips,  a ravaged wasteland  ruled by the demonic   and omnipotent Darkseid.  He psychically feeds   on the despair  and misery of others.  Because of   their opposite natures,  these two worlds have been   locked in eternal war.  However, an uneasy truce   was established  when Darkseid and Highfather   exchanged their infant sons.  Unfortunately,   this has not diminished  Darkseid's ambitions.  For years   he has searched the galaxies  for the legendary   Anti-Life Equation,  a formula that would give him   complete control  over all living things.  In his endless search,  he has conquered and subjugated planet after planet.  Now he threatens Earth.  He's already provided  human agents  with Apokoliptic  weaponry.  The hover tank?  Is just a prelude.   [CELL PHONE RINGING]  Turpin.  I'm here to offer  my assistance  in the coming  battle.  Well, strap on your six-gun,   space cowboy.  Your playmates are attacking  Sinnott Air Force Base.  [SIRENS WAILING]  [TIRES SCREECH]  What?   Take cover!  MAN: Down!   MAN 2: Go, go, go! Blue Leader One,  I just lost contact  with the tower.  Cover me.  Roger.  Locked on target.  Fire!  [MEN PANTING]  [GRUNTING]  Scratch one hero.  [YELLING]  [YELLING,  GROANING] By the Source.  [BOTH YELLING]  [GROANS]  Help!   Get us outta here! [GRUNTING]  This ain't happening.  [GROANS]  I take it the battle   is not going well.  It's not my fault. It's that new guy. [GRUNTING]  Orion.  You know that creep?  Doesn't matter. We're ready to begin   phase two, Mr. Mannheim.  You mean   the power plant?  Now?  Now.  Who--? Who are you?  How did you--?  So many questions,  so little time.  [SCREAMS]  [SIRENS WAILING]  [BRAKES SCREECH]  [FIRE TRUCK   HORN HONKING] [GRUNTING]  You know, Superman,  I play a pretty good game,  but, uh,  not in this league.  I don't know what we would   have done without you.  I'm not the one to thank. It was a good thing   you showed up, Orion. It was too easy.  Oh, yeah. A real   walk in the park.  Don't mock me.  Darkseid will consider this  a minor setback, if that.  I know how he thinks.  Oh?  Yes.  I'm his son.  I was the infant   Darkseid gave up  to pay for his...   uneasy truce.  I'm sorry.  I had no idea.  It doesn't matter.  Right now,   I must return to New Genesis  and report Darkseid's   latest aggressions.  You may use this to contact me  when you need further help.  And you will need it.  [BEEPING]  BRUNO:   The island's been evacuated,   just like you ordered.  And the incendiary's all set  to take out  the reactor's   cooling system.  There it goes.  You know, Darkseid,  you and me,   we make a great team.  Hmm. Indeed. You have served me well,  Mr. Mannheim.  And now, farewell. Ah?  What gives? What about me?  You promised   you'd make me a king!  And so you are. The king of fools. Darkseid?  Darkseid.  No!  Gotta be a kill switch. [YELLS]  [MOANS]  Aah!  [GRUNTING]  [SPLUTTERING] Come on.  [GRUNTING]  [RUMBLING]   Yes!  [EXPLOSION]  Holy Hannah! Orion was right.  It isn't over.  [♪♪♪]
