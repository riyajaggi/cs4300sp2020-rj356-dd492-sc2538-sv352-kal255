  [♪♪♪]  [♪♪♪]  [GRUNTING]  You know Cignian fighting  techniques.  I'm impressed.  I'm not, if that's all  you have to show me.  Patience, Maxima. Sometimes the hunter  likes to play with his prey.  Yes. Sometimes she does. [GRUNTS]  [SCREAMS]

 [INDISTINCT MURMURING]  The prey is cornered.  The victory is mine,  and so are you, Maxima.  My queen.  My mate.  My foot.  [SCREAMS]  [MOANS]  [GRUNTS]  ALL:   Oh, no.  Ahh-uh!  Great, another loser.  Isn't there a single warrior   in this whole crummy galaxy  who can take me?

 At this rate,  I'll die a maiden.  My lady, another candidate   has been found.  The scouts have brought   viso-recordings  of his heroic   deeds.  Sure. I could use   a good laugh.  Bring them   to my room. Ow!  [ALL GASP]  Ugh. If I find  one split end,  you'll be in the stables  brushing the horses.  [BOTH GASP]  SAZU:   He lives on the planet   called Earth,  although our scouts inform us  that he's Kryptonian by birth.  The Earth natives  call him "Superman."  Hm, Superman.  I like those shoulders.  And that chin.  Oh. Our children   will be  absolutely gorgeous.  Shall I have   the ambassador contact  him?  No, I'll handle this...  personally.  But,   my lady, your counselors  are waiting, and--  Let them wait!   God knows I have.  And if this one's   as promising as he looks...  you can start ordering   the wedding pattern.  Mistress, wait.  DE'CINE:  So she took the bait?  You knew   she would.  She's young,  headstrong-- Hormonal. Having  second thoughts, my dear?  I feel like... I've betrayed her. No, she betrayed you.  See how she ran off?  That's how much she cares  for her people.  But together,   you and I,  we can change things   here on Almerac.  No, my--  My lady would never  let us be together. Just leave   everything to me.  [MOANS]  Whoa. Not so fast,   legs.  Where you headed?  Costume party?  I'm here to find a mate.  [ALL WHOOP]  Well, here I am,  babe.  Hey!  Did you hear me say   you could paw me?  I don't think so.  Hey, who do you  think you are?  I am the Lady  Maxima.  [SCREAMS] Warrior queen.  Head of the royal house.  And leader of all Almerac.  [GROANS]  Feel free to bow.  [HORNS HONK IN DISTANCE] MAN [ON TV]   Angela Chen's special report,  "Man of Steel,   Man of Mystery,"  continues after these messages. Fifty cents. Ahh!  Where is this coming from?  We're in trouble,   people.  The Superman piece   is coming up short.  We need to fill two minutes.   Anybody have any ideas?  Hey!  I said,   out of my way.  Excuse me?  I am the Lady Maxima:  warrior queen,   head of the royal house,  leader of all Almerac.  And Superman's betrothed.  [WHISPERING]   Thank you.  ANGELA [ON TV]:   You know, you've just   broken the hearts  of about a million hopeful,   single women.  But seriously,   as Superman's wife--  Not his wife.  His betrothed.  His destined mate.  If he proves himself worthy.  Really?  And how's he supposed  to do that?  Why, in battle,   of course.  So where is he?  [GRUNTS]  [CREW SHOUTING   INDISTINCTLY]  [CRASH]  [INDISTINCT MURMURING]  I want him.  And I want him now.  I'm waiting.  Huh?  Superman.  Yeow!  And you are?  Later for that.  Almerac awaits us.  You need only prove  yourself, and--  Listen, I'm afraid   you've got the wrong idea. I'm flattered you've taken  a shine to me,  but my home is here  on Earth.  Are you refusing  the royal throne of Almerac?  Are you refusing me?  Well, yes.  Oh!  [GROWLS]  [GROWLS]  Oof!  I know you're upset, but--  Now, wait a minute. Someone's gonna get hurt. Yeah. You!  [CRIES OUT]  Loser.  And I had such high hopes.  Whoa!  [GRUNTING]  So you have some life   in you after all.  [STRAINS]  Harry, there's a man   and a woman fighting. Stop spying on the neighbors,   Lucille.  [GRUNTING]  Now he's got her   tied up.  No one has ever lasted  this long with me.  No one.  You are...  my equal.  This is the happiest day  of my life.  I'm...glad.  Oh, my goodness.  They're hugging.  Just don't get any ideas.  Of course, now you'll  have to marry me.  Uh, you can't just barge in  and make demands like that. Why not?  On my planet,   I do it all the time.  Well,   this isn't Almanac. Almerac.  Whatever.  Here on Earth, marriage isn't  something you can command.  Marriage is a willing  partnership  where husbands  and wives share the decisions   and sacrifices. What planet is he from?  You can't force me  to marry you.  Watch me.  [SCREAMS]  Sooner or later,  I knew you'd fall for me.  [INDISTINCT CHATTERING]  [GASPING]  My lady.  Congratulate me.   I'm getting married. Congratulations.  [GRUNTING]  Sazu. Call the Minister   of Rituals.  My betrothed and I   are ready to...  My lady.  My throne.  Arrest them at once.  No, Maxima.   I think not.  Guards.  You sure   you're queen? [GROANS]  So this is what you  pick for a mate.  Doesn't look like much.  [GRUNTING]  [GASPS]  You'll die for this.   Both of you.  When my people   hear of your treachery--  Your people were only  too glad for this treachery.  They call it liberation.  Traitorous witch!  [SCREAMS]  [MOANS]  No, my lady.  It is you who are   the traitor.  A spoiled,   self-interested brat  more concerned   with trapping a mate  than the needs   of your people.  Under new leadership,  all Almerac will prosper   and grow.  Isn't that right,  my love?  I couldn't have  put it better.  Mwah.  Guards, send these three  to the catacombs.  Three?   De'Cine?  Please, Sazu.   Don't embarrass yourself.  Just remember how great it was  while it lasted.  [GRUNTS]  [LAUGHS]   No!  All right,   what's for dinner?  [ALL GRUNT]  Forgive me, my lady.   He deceived me.  I-- I was a fool.  A dead fool.  No.  I'm still queen here,  head of the royal house,  leader of all Almerac.  But you can't just go around   killing people.  I have the power   to do as I please. And the responsibility  to do what is right.  As leader, you serve the people. They don't serve you.  Now,   where are we?  Miles   underground.  I used to use these ancient   tunnels as a prison.  No wonder   you're so popular.  Uh...  [SIZZLES]   [SCREAMS]  The tunnels are shielded  to prevent escape.  Great.  Mistress--  Silence, Sazu.  [MOANING]  We should move before   the Carnorite hears us. [GROWLING] I'm betting that's  the Carnorite.  [SIZZLING]  [SCREAMS]  [GRUNTING]  [SCREAMS]  [GRUNTING]  This way.  [GROWLING]  How big   is this thing?  Big.  [ALL GRUNT]  We have to try to  stun him, fast.  Be ready to strike.  [GRUNTS]  [SIZZLES]   [SCREAMS]  [SCREAMS]  Maxima, now!  [GRUNTS]  [SHRIEKS]  [SIZZLES]  [GROWLS]  [GRUNTS]  What a man.  Later.  [ARABIC MUSIC PLAYING]  GUARD:   Halt! Hey! [BOTH GRUNT]  Kill them!  [ALL SCREAM]  [GRUNTING]  [GASPS]  Superman!  [ALL SCREAMING]  [GRUNTS]  This time, De'Cine,   it's no game.  This time, I kill you.  Maxima.  I don't kill him?  I...lock him up?  For a really long time.  Sazu.  Yes,   mistress?  Escort the prisoner to one of  the really nasty dungeons.  One with   plenty of rats.  Yes, mistress.  Well...?  It's a start.  A start.   What about us?  You know I can't   stay here, Maxima. [WHINING]   Oh!  Very well.  I release you   from our betrothal.  You're free to go.  Thanks.  Are there any more at home   like you?  No, but as my mother   always said,  "There's someone   for everyone."  [EXPLOSION] [GRUNTS]  I'm here to get   that fraggin',  scum-suckin',   rat-scratchin' De'Cine,  and nobody had better stop me.  Yeow!  [♪♪♪]
