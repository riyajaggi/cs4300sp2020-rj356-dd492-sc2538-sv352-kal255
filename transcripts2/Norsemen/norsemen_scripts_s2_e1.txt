 -Whoa -Laughs You feeling hungry? Actually...I had a little bitty snack before we started, so I'm fine for now. Do you think you'll be hungry again soon?...or do people think we should make something together later? Or what? I'm not really sure what the plan is. It's just, if people want to have dinner later,

 I guess I'll just grab something now. I feel I need some quick bites or something. Then we can make something together later. -Frøya! -Yeah? What are your thoughts about food? Are you hungry? Arvid is hungry. Ah. maybe we can we defile first? then eat later. I mean...who like to rape on a full stomach. RUFUS: The thing with me which you will experience when we get to Rome It's that I'm the kind of person that fills a room. A magnetic personality, that you can sense has entered the room, long before you see him.

 Wow, I haven't noticed much of that, yet. Well, that's how I am. I just didn't employ it in that stone age village of yours. people wouldn't have understood anyway. Norheim ... I wonder if they miss us. if only they knew how little I missed them. and their horrible culture, all the brutality. I can't wait to be among likeminded people on the continent. Speaking of Rome, Do you think we're getting close? We've been traveling for months Shouldn't we be there soon? If I had been a globe maker or a map drawer... I probably would have been able to answer that question. But all we can do is follow the sun since the sun always points South. We have to trust it. Yes? By Loki, this was nice. What a perfect day, You know what? It's so important to be able to stop and just take it all in. Yeah. Just be present in the moment. Yeah, that's so true. What a place this is, huh? Yeah, we were just talking about it. We should just, Ah... settle here... Fertile soil, weak enemies, lots of treasures. Yeah, that what we should do. We should settle down here and establish a colony, or something. Look at this! The Gods must be so pleased with us This is the third day in a row we find a campsite with a fire pit and everything. See. Once you get just a little further South on the continent everything improves markably. RUFUS: I don't think old Norway sets up campsites and stuff like that for their people. Up there in that pile of rocks it's all about putting as many sticks as possible in people's wheels. Am I the only one who thinks this campsite looks suspiciously like yesterday's? It has to be same place. I slept there. Liv, stop complicating things... Please, I mean... How different can two campsites be? A camp site is a camp site. Yes? We burned their village to the ground. Or what was left of it. It seems like they've been pillaged a good number of times already. Oh really? Actually it seems they've been pillaged so many times that they've stopped rebuilding. They just sat there when we attacked It didn't seem they cared one way or the other that they're being pillaged. This is all the loot we got. Rats? This turnips actually it doesn't taste half bad. This is so miserable, Torstein! Pillaging here in the East is so passé. It has become kind of mainstream. Oh yes. It felt like we just have to steal something just to make it seem like we know what we're doing. Bundle up whatever slaves we have... tonight we sail, for Norway. I dont know ... I'm kind of starting to doubt this whole endeavor. Doubt? Yes. Well, you're going to be famous. The chieftans wife. You decided to abandon a life of fortune to bum around with two outlaws. Yeah It commands respect. The thing is, Im not a chieftan's wife anymore. No? Sure you are. No, The chieftans wife is not a title they can take away from you. Wrong, Arvid kind of did. No, no, no... As strong as the Women's Rights are now... in the Viking Age I think Arvid can not dump you like a bad habit...No You know, If I were you, I would seek legal help. Because, I think you have a pretty strong case. And you tell me me? Yeah...But anyway, that's water under the bridge. Now, as I've decided to start saying because now we're almost there. (A twig snaps.) What was that? Is anyone there? My intuition tells me it's nothing to worry about. It's no one there, we're all alone... Sturla Bonecrusher? Old buddy! You so gave us a fright. This must be the craziest coincidence ever. Old acquaintances meeting by chance in a completely unlikely place. Don't just stand there Sturla... sit down, take a load off. Before I take it off for you. Have some rodent. Or two. Raids are great. But I'm sure it will be nice to come home again too. I think I prefer to be on the raid. -Yeah. -Yeah. I guess the situation at home is a little... Messy, since... We're kind of Boyfriend and Girlfriend. I live together with Hildur and she's pregnant and all that... Yeah... It's... a little messy. -Yeah -Yeah. if that baby in her stomach is mine... I feel like I kind of have to be there. What do you mean, if? the baby's yours? It is isn't it? Loki if I know... I was thinking about it. and when I look back... I don't think she came. Okay. I mean, I...I...I came by the buckets Crazy amounts seed in her... Uh huh. But, I don't think she came. Or climaxed, or whatever its called. And in that case... the baby can't be mine. I don't know if the woman has to cum in order to make a baby. Or maybe she does... That would explain why I never had the baby with Orm Huh? So... How are you filling your days, Sturla? After your little "mutiny" in Norrheim? I capture lawless... and sell 'em as slaves. Human trafficking? Well, I guesss...uh... somebody's gotta do it. We're heading to Rome. Away from the frigid North and to... more Southern climes. You haven't gotten very far. Uhhh...Yeah, we have. Norheim is a three day march from here. -So no. -Three days march? We spent two months on a three day's march? By Odin, you two! Us two? Excuse me... If anyone is to blame here, it almost has to be the Sun. Because, that's what we followed. What are you three actually doing out here in the middle of the forest? Good question...Um... I guess you could say that a number of uh... unfortunate circumstances led to uh... the result of us becoming...uh... -Orm. -...outlaws. But...uh, that needs to remain our little secret. So you have no legal protection? Everyone can do what ever they want with you? In theory yes... but hardly likely in practice. Okay, talk to you later folks. Don't let anyone steal your dreams. [chuckles] No... and uh...Rome isn't a dream... it's a reality. any minute now. Come on... we have to get away from here, before he comes back. Liv, you always think the worst of people. Bonecrusher may be a little rough around the edges... but deep down, there's a heart of gold. You don't have a heart of gold if you're called The Bonecrusher. Liv... You do realize that we have to get away now. what we realize is that we need to sleep. because it's a very long day. I can get real grumpy tomorrow, if I don't get enough sleep. and that's not a threat, it's simply a warning for your own good. By, Thor and Odin, how hard can it be to keep up the pace? Well, several of them are missing a leg, and... This one guy, I think he's missing his eyes, also. This is not good. It's embarrassing Let's get rid of theese slaves before we meet someone we know. ARVID: Well, If it isn't Jarl Varg's men? Long time no see. Likewise. Oh, you're here too? Yeah, yeah...we have this incredible bounty from the West that we're going to try to get rid of. Tell me about it. Yeah, us too, but only from the east. Yeah...Too bad there are limits to how much you can actually bring home from these raids. We had to dump six slaves during our crossing. because of the weight... simply too much boobs and muscles. Ya know, tooo much ballast. By Loki... have you been pillaging in Helheim? Or what? No. They might look a little shabby, but...uh...this is prime merchandise. You're calling him, -'prime merchandise'? -Yeah. I am. Yeah, you know the body compensates. Say, If you lose an arm... the body will make your other arm twice as strong. -Oh? -Yeah. Yeah... So it has nothing to say, so... No, makes no difference at all. So...okay. We're actually very thrilled that we have...defective slaves. They're going to be in great demand. Good for you. Of couse these slaves have a different appeal. ah. -They're more for the connoisseurs. -Yeah? -Yeah, must be. -Not as commercial as yours. So, uh...yeah.... Of course your slaves have a larger range of buyers but...um, if we find the right buyer here we will truly strike it rich. Yeah, we'll see about that. -See you later. -Yeah, yeah we do, okay. Come on. Okay...Let us just go. -Come on! Get moving! Jarl Varg. Arvid. And the hand thief. Having a snack are we? And the prosthesis, are they... working alright? You being fed? Anything wrong with them? No. They're excellent. Cutting edge. Oh great. I See you've got a lot of stash there. Hmm Been out West again, Arvid? Yeah, just got back. Great trip. Maybe it's time you gave me that map, Olav promised me? I'm gonna say 'No' to that. You going to break Olav's promise? Remember, breaking a promise... can bring punishment. Varg, you're sitting there without hands threatening me? Isn't that a little weird? I mean... you're by definition... functionally disabled. Yeah. You can not wage war, You can not row, you can not sail... Can you do anything hand related at all? No. Hmmm...Then what do you need that map for? I get a very 'pearls for swine' feeling here. Anyway...see you later. Arvid! You and I will meet again. Under different circumstances. Yeah, sure. What do you have in mind? Arvid, I can't start explaining that now Mark my works... we will meet again under different circumstances. The next time we meet... it would be pretty weird if it was right there and the circumstances were identical. Just leave, Arvid. Oh...just saying. Hmm. ARVID: It would be strange, right? So big! Yes Sir, once again Tor and Odin have shown that they truly...appreciate the work we do. because if it had been so wrong to ravage and slaughter and rape... We wouldn't be standing here today with all these wonderful spoils of war. So, uh...on the count of 'three' go ahead and help yourselves. One, two, three! Okay, So you are giving it all away? Yeah, Yeah, it was Hildurs Idea. -Yes, it was Hildurs Idea. and you know this stuff. Yes, a chieftan has to buy loyalty. That's how it works. Uh huh, I see. Now it's finished... -Oh it's beautiful. -Yeah? -You making one in the middle? -yeah, a third one. Yes, it's lovely. I will say Arvid... This cape, is lovely. You two...Well pillaged. Thank you. Well, have a seat. -Ah, Thank you. -You should maybe have something to eat. You have to eat for two now. -[giggles] -No? Isn't this great? What? You'd you think this situation would be a little more awkward Not everyone would be able to handle a boyfriend living with a woman he has just sprayed tons of seed into. No. But you do Frøya. and I must say I really respect that. -And very generous. -Mmm hm. You give me room to be the First Lady in the Village. And I give you room to cultivate your relationship. Even though I'm pregnant with Arvid's baby. You just have to respect that generosity. So true. I mean, what the three of us have here is so unique. it is. Håkon? Now it's about time you start to communicate with your family. All you do is sit and stare, all day long. You don't play with the other children anymore. And you haven't worked for Jarl Varg since you came back from Norheim. Will you please tell me if something's wrong? Children, run out there and play. And I'll talk to your daddy. By Thor, Tell me what happened. Did something unpleasant happen on that trip? [mumbling] You know, that trip turned out to be totally... Very, very difficult. How so? Did you have to march with blisters? No. Gnats? Were there so many gnats you couldn't sleep? There weren't that many gnats. Then what was it? We got to Norheim... And the first thing we had to do, Was... to maim and murder a bunch of the people who lived there. -What? -Yeah. And... And then Varg insisted we ravish one of their women. Ravish? As in... Rape? With your willie? Not...lick-rape? No, no...he wanted us to... To rape with our willie. I must say, this is shocking. -And Varg, of all people? -Yes...yes. This time he went too far. Way to far...way too far. He forced us way outside our comfort zone. You have to do something. You can't go on like this. Work is something you should look forward to, not something you should dread. I mean, you should just tell him. I mean. it's all about communication. -Yep -Right? Yep. What's the worst thing that can happen? I don't know. Now tell me, Håkon... Have you ever heard of something called phantom pain? Nnn..no. Me neither. I just had a thought I...I wanted to share with you. A...A suggestion... Um...an Idea. Yes? The thing is, some of the solders feel that things have gone far enough. That things have gone... Gotten a little out of hand. I mean... It's Okay that we're supposed to be...uh a little rough around the edges. But it's kind of...uh... ...the total picture here. With the gruesome leadership style and evil plans... and all that. May...Maybe that's gone a tad too far. Anyway... I was thinking. Maybe we... could organize a seminar? Where we can spend some time discussing where we are, where we want to be. And...and...and things like...yeah that. And even have a value disscussion. Excellent. Excellent! Most people go for young, beautiful slaves, When they want to command someone to milk their lizard. Okay. Not me. Classic mistake. You have to go for experience. This one has spanked the wank since before Fenrir... ...was shackled. Okay. So, if there is nothing else... No, th...th...that was all. Stop! Slow down... Hmm? Keep up. Well... if it isn't Sturla Bonecrusher! Chieftain Arvid. I found something out in the woods that may be in your interest. All right! Huh...that will be a little exciting. Hi, hi. Hi, Frøya, Arvid, Hildur. [Orm] Yes, yes. Uh...Liv? Uh...what happened to her? Liv? I...I...I don't know. She may have been taken by wolves. Wolves and menstruating women, you know. it's not a good combo. Well, that's...uh... That's tragic. My deepest condolences to her next of kin. That's you. Because, you are her husband. No, I'm not. It's not me, so...Nah. So...uh, well... What are we supposed to do with you two? Well... I was thinking maybe just uh... forget about everything...and just s..s..start over with a clean rune stick. No way. No way! Because you back-stabbed the entire village in the back. So... Ain't gonna happen. No. ORM: No, yes...no... Well...I...I...think that you know... many, many unfortunate things have been said and done by both sides. Ya know, but I think that if we feel really deep down, and sense, then I think, ya know... we all are very regretful to what has happened...all of us. -No. -Mm Mm. And besides, none of those unfortunate things that happened were our fault. Because I think we have to blame the Norns. You know, the Norns who rule the destiny of gods and men. -Oh yeah? -Yes because everyone knows th...that the Norns..they... they twine the threads of fate. You know... so every man's life is...is... predetermined. So it was predetermined that we all did exactly what we all did. Orm actually has a point here. It's true that... -Ragnar -What? This is fate, isn't it? Sorry, I just had no control. It's predetermined, right? [laughter] I'm not so strong with the ...laws and rules and stuff like that. So...uh... especially when you bring the Norns into all of this. So...Uh... Lawspeaker, what do you think about of this? Well... Not everybody will like what I have to say. But I am the Lawspeaker, and my judgement must be respected. There's no doubt that Orm has hereditary right to the throne. That's right. That's so true... -So true. -His father was a chieftain... his brother was a chieftain. He has chieftain blood in his veins. Therefore Orm should be the chieftain of Norheim. -Yes...I... -Thank you, thank you. I'm very proud and I'm very humble. And I look forward to digging into my tasks -as sss..soon as I can... -But! he has failed his people. And has thereby disqualified himself. -No! -Yes. I must therefore put the law of inheritance and succession aside, and say that, as long as I live Orm will be placed at the bottom of society as a slave! No, no...No! No! And Rufus... You came as a slave... and you will stay one! No, no! I can do the work of a hundred men intellectually. But zero physically! I'm a creative person! I'm even left-handed! RUFUS: No! No!
