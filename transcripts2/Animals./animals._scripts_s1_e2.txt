I feel betrayed right now, but over the last couple days, I have felt happier than I have - in a very, very long time. - Me, too. I'm gonna have a lot of therapy. It's a real short life, and I guess I'm a log cabin pigeon, because whether he's a male or a female, - I love Phil very much. - Oh... This was gonna be a surprise. To celebrate our love, we're gonna be having a reception at the top of the green lady with - the ice cream thing. - Oh, my God. - Guys, what do you say? - Let's go! (laughing) We're going to the big, green lady with the ice cream thing. That's so wild! All right, who's ready to fly? Let's do this! - Whoo! - Let's do this! Actually, so, how are we gonna get there, we're gonna... - We're gonna fly. - We'll fly there. We're gonna fly, you fucking pussy. Okay. ♪ Pour your gravy in me ♪ ♪ Oww! ♪ ♪ Pour your gravy in me ♪ Whoo! ♪ Pour your gravy in me ♪ ♪ Oww! ♪ Hey, folks, got into a big argument and now you have to prove your manliness to another Little League dad, but you just don't have the time to do it naturally? (chuckles) I know I don't. Hi, I'm Bartholomew Birdman. I'm here to help you with all that stuff that I just said. I have a revolutionary new product that will make you fly faster, farther, and metaphorically further than you ever could have before. It's an all-natural "American made" product called "Illegal Wing Enhancing Steroid Injections." Call now while the syringe is hot. Uh... Instead of calling me, if you could text me. Texting is way better. If it's a number I don't recognize, it's usually like, "no thank you." Could be the authorities trying to trap me. Anyway, I, uh... Text me now!
