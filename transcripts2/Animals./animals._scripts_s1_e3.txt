I live right next door. - I mean, I'm right... - Oh, you're in 103? - Yes. - We've never seen him before, though. Well, Mike, I would say, I've never left the apartment. - Oh, that's true. - So...

Remember the big plane, Shane? - Yeah, the Boeing 747. - Yeah. Okay, so he knows the deal, okay. Yeah, it was huge. And you can't really pass them - because of the side things on its wing. - Right. Mm-hmm. - You get sucked right into it. - Right. That happened to Gary. - Do you remember Gary? - Oh, my... Yes! No, I know. And I remember. And the feathers were flying all over the place. And I said, "Well, Gary has just passed on." - That's right. - You said, Do you remember what I said? I said, "Gary has just passed on." - Guys, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - Yeah, I said that. You just... Can you just stop? Just stop talking? Do you know how many times you've told this story? - It always feels like the first time. - Mm-hmm. Every day! In this exact spot. Aren't you sick of this? Should we move? - There's a trash can over there. - Yeah, it's right there. - It's great. - We've been to the trash can. I feel like there's a whole world out there, and we've never seen it. Aren't you curious? We should head over to the trash can. Let's go to the trash can. I think we just go. Why don't you guys go to the trash can. I'm just gonna... I think I gotta go. Huh. Well, good on Shane, you know? So, anyway, he gets too close to the wing, and he just got... whoosh! sucked right in. Oh my God, it was so disturbing. What the... No way. Swans. Sorry about that. You understand. You can't just let anybody in. Totally fine.

That's always been a dream of mine. Oh my God, it's so nice to see another writer! Insane, right? Yeah, it's a novel about my brother, Mike. - So, it's... - Amazing. Yeah, he commissioned me to write it. I did. So, it's a mixture of Mike history, Mike anecdotes, and just general Mike-isms. - Uh-huh. - 'Cause I think it's... it's such an honor to be with you every day, - and I love you so much. - Oh, thank you, so much. I love you so much. - You are everything to me. - Thank you. I appreciate that. You guys have an intense relationship. - I don't know about "intense." - I don't think it's that...

I don't... - What is your regimen for this? - You know, I do want to ask you, - is how do you...? - Au naturel, yeah. Au naturel. I have a bunch of dreadlocked fur around my asshole. My asshole looks like Rob Zombie. ♪ I am the Astro-Creep ♪ Yeah! Okay, we've got more of the apartment to see. - Why don't we go ahead and... - Okay, cool. I'd love to see more.

Alex, we know you're super busy, and we just thought we'd lay out all this stuff. Look, we have, um, four different types of dry food, and we have eight types of cat toys that we can all play with and share together. And we figured, I don't know, as our new best friend, we should feast together a little bit. Wow. I mean... thank you. I don't know what to say. Don't say anything. Eat. - Whoa. - Okay. Wow. Alex, you're... When's the last time you've eaten, buddy? Okay, gross. He's eating the toys, too. I think he's eating the toys at this point. He's just... He's so... Okay. Whoa, he's just... - Easy.

Before you guys kill me, Phil, would you, uh... Hmm? Would you mind reading from your novel? From my novel? No, I couldn't. - It's still in a first draft. - Wait, Phil, this is perfect, actually. - What? Why? - Well, now you have an audience. I think Alex really wants to hear it. It's just like a last rites thing. It'd be a nice way for me to go. Okay. All right, I'm gonna do it. - Okay, cool. - Okay, okay. Okay, this is the middle of chapter 18. - Oh, I love 18. - Okay, great. Okay, everyone shut up. Hehe. "It was a dark and stormy night last fall. Phil was always afraid of thunder. It reminded him of a vacuum." Easy, easy... "As he cowered in fear like a stupid little baby under the couch," Yes! "he thought that maybe things Peace out, motherfuckers. Weren't gonna be that good after that. Until he saw a paw." Oh, man. "He saw Mike." - Okay, that's it. - Dude! That's all I'm gonna read for now. Was that good? Yes, dude, are you kidding me? Well, you inspired me to do it! Honestly, I bet there's not a dry eye in the house. Uh... You know what, he's gone. 'Cause we were looking at each other. We were making pretty intense eye - contact throughout that. - I can't not. Fuck. Should we... - chase after him? - I don't know. What time is it? It's 3:30. I love you, Phil. I love you, Mike. I love you so much, Mike. I loved it. It was great. Chapter seven... How many of these do we have? I'm getting kind of tired. Parched too. If I could get a water, that'd be great. All right, what's your name, brother? Hi, my name is Max. Hey, Max. I... I... I run "Alex Questions," the Tumblr blog that q... that questions... uh, questioning your book. Oh, you write that?

Did you fabricate... D... Did you fabricate the... the book? No. And I went through a lot of therapy to help me with my PTSD, thank you, and I'm a strong person. Unlike some people that write a blog. You ever written a book? I wrote a children's book when I was 22. What's it called? "The Third Best Tree." "The Third Best Tree"? Hey, everybody, the author of "The Third Best Tree" is here. "The Third Best Tree" is a fiction book, sir, and y... you're claiming this is a memoir, sir. It is a memoir, a good one. A lot of people suspect that you fff... fabricated sss... some portions of the story wholesale. Well, d-d-d-d-d-d-d I didn't. Th-th-th-th-that's all, folks. - Discrimination. - Discrimination? Answer the facts, sir. Answer the question! Don't make fun of the messenger's childhood stutter. Aah! Synced and corrected by VitoSilans - www.addic7ed.com -
