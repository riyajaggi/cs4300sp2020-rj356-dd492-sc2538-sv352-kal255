 -=Oppa calling=- (Oppa - Older brother, boyfriend) Ae Jeong! Ae Jeong! What do I do? What do I do? Nosebleed! Paper towels, paper towels... Oh, what to do? Ah! Why don't you answer the phone? Hey, Ae Jeong! Where did she park the car? Mr. Dok Go Jin, do you have a tissue? Blood. I look like I've been beaten, right?

 Ah, it's a bit obvious. What to do? My oppa might see me like this. Mr. Dok Go Jin, can you give me a ride? Mmm? I don't want my oppa to see me like this. I can't be seen by him. Mr. Dok Go Jin, can you take me out of the parking garage? Ae Jeong! Ae Jeong! Now what the heck are you doing? Get in quickly. Quickly! Quickly! Quickly! Where did she go? In here?

 Her car is here, but where did she go? Drive, fast! Quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly! -=Episode 3=- Oppa, I met an acquaintance. He asked me to have a meal with him. You can go home. Okay? Okay. This is a great car! It must be worth a fortune! It's real leather, right? Not fake, right? It's nice! Here, drink this and stop talking nonsense. It would be less embarrassing that way. Isn't this the Dok Go Jin drink that you endorse? And so? Mr. Dok Go Jin. So, you really drink this every day. The drink you endorse, printed with your very own picture! It must feel really good, right? Don't do it that way. Don't rub your face on my picture. It's very strange when I look at it. Take it off. Put it on the side with words. I know already. I already have other plans. That's why I can't participate in your program. I want to make it clear to you before I go. Hey, I heard you've recently been on blind dates. Our stars are really not bad. Don't go on those blind dates. This will be better. Have you seen these? Take a look. You'll see a lot of good-looking people. Park Yeon Ah, Kang Sun Hye I have seen them. They are really good. Good personality too. Park Shi Yeon, Gu Ae Jeong, Jung Yeon Joo, Ha Ru Mi, Shin Sung Ae... With so many people, there must be someone you would like to meet. You can't buy me with ten billion Won.  I am a National Treasure.  Don't be like that!  I'm coming over. It is indeed Kang Se Ri! You seem indifferent to people. And he even came all the way here to participate. He seemed as if he wouldn't participate. Maybe he didn't mean it? Then, when he didn't recognize me, was he just pretending? I was relying on you, but now I'm in big trouble. I'm leaving. You're Mr. Yun Pil Ju, right? I'm the program scriptwriter, Han Myung Jung. You're more handsome than I imagined you would be. This is my business card. Fine. Sorry, sunbae. (Sunbae - Senior, mentor) How could he just walk away like that? He declined to participate. Mr. Yun Pil Ju. Do you have a moment? Ah! Miss Kang Se Ri. You did not recognize me again? No. I mean, your hair and clothes were different last time. I heard that you won't participate. Yes. You should have informed me first. How will I save face in front of the producers? I didn't think that you would lose face. If it was like that, I apologize. And another thing! Whenever you don't recognize me, it makes me feel bad. In that case, I should be careful. In the future, whenever I see a beautiful woman on the street I'll double check if it's you. You're just going to leave? Yes. Do you have anything else to say to me? No, I don't. Mr. Yun Pil Ju! Did you just let him leave like that? He said he absolutely won't do it? Writer Han, you have to catch that man. Every day I hear people say that I'm beautiful. But he just made my heart flutter. If he can also make the audience's hearts flutter, then he's perfect. I should probably save you from any further embarrassment. I'll take a taxi back. Can you pull over nearby? Good idea. - Give me some money before you leave. - Can I borrow some money? I didn't bring my purse and I don't have taxi fare. I don't carry money because I have a manager. Then can you take me in the direction you're going? Why else would I ask you for money? I'm out of gas. You're really out of gas. What can we do? What use is it to have a nice car if you don't check the gas gauge? Isn't it because of you that I didn't? There's a manager that helps me deal with these trivial matters every day, right? Where else should I be, hyeong? I'm at the studio. (Hyeong - Older brother) Hyeong, how about you? I thought you said you were coming? Where are you? I'm in Yeoido and I ran out of gas. Call me when you're around Yeoido. Call me when you get here. Make it fast. He said he's coming? It will probably take him about 30 minutes, right? You'd better go. I wasn't planning on leaving. Since it'll be a while, I wanted to go to the bathroom over there. How about you go to the bathroom and leave? How could I without any taxi fare and like this...? I got it. Go. How come I have to witness such a scene? Omo, it's redder than I thought! (Omo - Oh My) What should I do? Then, I went around like this? It'll leave a bruise. Excuse me... Could I use a bit of that when you're done? Oh, sure. Thank you! That looks serious. Why would you let yourself get beat up? Break up with him. Right. I saw it in the bathroom. She must have been beaten up. Her face was hit, right? Was the bathroom clean? Not smelly, right? Mmm... You can't go out now. Why? The ajummas thought I was beaten up. (Ajumma - Older lady, aunt) You're crazy. They're looking to see who hit me. Then, they think it's me? They will misunderstand if you go out. Let me go. Let me go. I am Dok Go Jin. That's why you can't let them see you. Hide your face. They keep looking this way. What to do? You want to go to the bathroom and it's inconvenient to stay in the car, right? I'll let you know as soon as they leave. Tummy is bulging already? Maybe reclining the seat will make it better? =Don't think you are so mighty= =that you can think lowly of others.= =Not because you are great.= Is it Dok Go Jin who invited Ae Jeong for dinner? Quick answer to a quick question. Although listening to it gives me goosebumps. Even scandals have various levels. Having the two of them mixed together can only be a margin of error. Dok Go Jin is at this level, Ae Jeong is at that level. Does this make sense? Dok Go Jin is at this level, Ae Jeong is at that level. The two will average each other out. Ae Jeong should increase to this level. Normally, two people together under these circumstances... It falls from here. Perhaps they might end up in the middle? Eat quickly, Hyeong Kyu. Sandwich. Eat quickly. Thank you! Quickly, eat. Chew well. Thank you, mother Jenny. You should call me Auntie Jenny! Dad told me to call you that name. He said one day you will become my mother. Hyeong Kyu's Dad, I told you already. The levels are not the same. We're already late for the recording. Should I wake her up so she can take a taxi? Let her sleep. What's wrong with Gu Ae Jeong's face? Who did this? Don't tell me... Are you CRAZY? Originally, it's because the group of ajummas that wanted to see who hit her were all hell-bent and angry. Then why is it like that? I don't know. I didn't ask. Is she okay? I don't know. I didn't ask. When a woman gets beaten up, it's only polite to ask. Hyeong, ask her why she's like this and if she's okay. If I ask about that, I have to listen to her story. If I listen, then I'll be involved. If I get involved, then that will link us together. You're already linked. Why don't we wake her up? Let's go. Hyeong. Gu Ae Jeong. Gu Ae Jeong! Get up! Get up, quickly now. Get out, get out, get out. Here... This is for a taxi. Thank you! I will surely pay you back. I'll give you a call. Give me the phone. You don't need to pay me back. Don't call me. What the? My name isn't here. Let me find it. I told you last time. Why haven't you deleted my number? What did you save it as? It's not saved under D-O-K. It's under D-O-G. D-O-G? Dog Shit Jin? Dog Shit Jin?! It's because it sounds similar to Dok Go Jin. I can do what I want with my phone. Go. - Thank you. - Just go, already! Here, drink this and stop talking nonsense. It would be less embarrassing that way.  Gu Ae Jeong is also a celebrity. Is it okay if she leaves like this? Let's go, hyeongnim. (Hyeongnim - Respected older brother) Can't you see I'm drinking? Don't go. A taxi is here. Start the car. Yes, hyeongnim. Hyeongnim, your door is open. I'm back. Welcome back. Go wash up quickly and lie down here. That's enough! Ae Jeong has to do it. Doesn't she have a photo shoot? Ae Jeong's face is small, half a cucumber is enough. Half is enough. Oppa can put on a little more. Oh, Ae Jeong! You said you've eaten. Was it delicious? Yes, it was delicious. So you were starving? Don't tell oppa. Don't you have a poster shooting? Skin care is not enough, and you even got hit. I'll take a look. Is it alright, eonni? (Eonni - Older sister) I applied cucumber. Do you think cucumber is enough at your age? Yah! You have wrinkles. Really? That's not good. Tomorrow, go somewhere with me. Where? Eonni, this place looks expensive! Thank you! My mother has their card. I heard their service for the first beauty treatment is exceptional. Hello, madam. Hello. Mrs. Kim and Mrs. Yun, it's your first time here, right? This hospital is really luxurious. It's pretty. The entrance alone has a luxurious atmosphere, so those kind of customers that spend 3 000 Won on acupuncture and drink Samgyetang, (Samgyetang ? Ginseng chicken soup) you won't find any of them here. Please steep some Pu Erh Tea [post fermented green tea] for the ladies here. Yes. Aigoo, here's our Yun Pil Ju! (Aigoo - Oh Dear, Oh My God) These are my Luck Club members. Hello. How do you do? Ms. Kim is here for weight loss acupuncture. Miss Yun needs a fast diagnosis. Ms. Han is here to pick up her husband's prescription. I said you would give them a 20% discount, so just raise the price by 20%. Do you understand? Director Yun, be extra attentive! Yes, I will take special care. Hey... Hey... The director here is really cool! It has to be the best. There are so many ajummas here, aren't there? You might be right. Our Yun Pil Ju will soon be on a television program called Couple Making. Kang Se Ri is the host. That seems very famous! Our Director Yun has grown to be so handsome. - The television station is begging him to make an appearance. - This director here. Looks like he will be the male participant in Couple Making. If I had known earlier, then I would have looked more carefully. I only saw his silhouette. Let's take a closer look. There's no need. If I see him in advance, then on the show I won't act surprised. Not curious? Give them some tea. It's said to be decades old Pu-Erh Tea. I said it was expensive herbal medicine. Lie to them. Yes. But madam! The director told the television station he will not participate. What? I will follow accordingly with your plan. Compared to seeing patients, researching at the institute is more suitable for me. I have only stayed here because of you. But whether I am happy or not, Mom... Then this will be last deal with Mom, okay? It's the last time. Go on the show. As long as you are willing to go on the show, then I will no longer hold on tight and not let you go. What are you thinking? Going on the program will provide the best girls to go on a blind date with. If you become a celebrity doctor, you'll be even more famous. If you can, do it. Can you just enjoy the moment? If you don't like it... Then go do what you want do. You'll let me do what I want to do? Right. Can you guarantee it? Want me to write a letter of guarantee? The director is currently on duty? That's right. Taking this opportunity, please ask the director to see her. Sure, please fill in your information. Okay. Eonni, since we are meeting... Shouldn't I touch up first? That way, the doctor would recognize you in the future. Right? Right. Once I'm made up, he wouldn't recognize me. Of course. How is Ms. Kim's situation just now? Look at this data. Not bad. Yes, right. He really is quite handsome. The next patient? Sitting over there with a hair band. Wait, how come he seems so familiar? Where is she uncomfortable? She has some discomfort at the ankle. Drink this. Calm down.  Don't live like this in the future.  Ah, that time... Okay, I know. Hello. Let's see where you are uncomfortable. You said there is discomfort with your ankle, right? Gu Ae Jeong. Miss Gu Ae Jeong? Don't worry, doctor. Is that really Miss Gu Ae Jeong? - I don't have discomfort anywhere, sorry. - Huh? Gu Ae Jeong! Omo, eonni! What to do? What to do? We have to run. What is it? How can such a thing happen? Why is he here? If he recognizes me, then what? - 100... - Quickly, go! Gu Ae Jeong! I have been really unlucky recently. Run. Is it really Gu Ae Jeong? This director, he's the one with the 100 billion. He's the one that you misunderstood? That's right. You threw water at him at that time? What to do? Maybe he didn't recognize me this time? How can that be? He's going on the show. Wouldn't he meet you then? That's right. What should I do, eonni? If he's going on the show, you'll be the first one eliminated. Even if you give me you ten billion, you're still out! I'm really going nuts. How could I do such a thing? How can you hit the place where you were beaten? Eonni, what should I do? If you want to meet him at the television station, then reconcile now. Would he accept my apology if I buy an expensive set of rare medicinal herbs? I'm certain the person who hit Gu Ae Jeong yesterday was the Candies' Manager Jang. They recorded the same program together. Wasn't Manager Jang the manager for National Treasure Girls? I heard that they didn't get along. Back then, I heard he treated Gu Ae Jeong badly. That girl from Candies, Ha Ru Mi. Isn't she also participating in "Couple Making"? That means she'll run into Manager Jang often. Right now, the new actress is hot. Gu Ae Jeong will be voted out when compared to her. But why are you whispering? Because Dok Go Jin Hyungnim doesn't like hearing about Gu Ae Jeong. I'm trying to read over the script, and you're disturbing me. Go talk outside. Fine. Let's go. Yes, Representative. Gu Ae Jeong... What can we do? That's right, Gu Ae Jeong. Ignored by Ha Ru Mi, snubbed by Kang Se Ri, and slapped by Manager Jang. Might as well use Gu Ae Jeong to farm. We'll get a good harvest. Please enter. Hello. Please have a seat. Miss Gu Ae Jeong, you came back. - Yes. - Doctor, her chart. Okay, thanks. Why did you leave like that, then? I was a bit surprised. Do you think no one will recognize you if you cover your face like that, Miss Gu Ae Jeong? You recognized me? You're Gu Ae Jeong from National Treasure Girls. You do recognize me. It's not like I'm a very famous celebrity... I'm not much of anything, but I'm honored. Why? Didn't you say you were a 10 billion Won National Treasure Girl? Remember me now? I'm really very sorry, Doctor. I entered the wrong room that day, which caused a little misunderstanding. On top of it, you answered me. That added to the confusion. Thinking you were really trying to give me 100 billion and do something to me... I did not say I would give you 100 billion. Yes. It was the amount that I came up with. Anyway, it is good that we could meet again. I have been wondering why you did what you did. And it seemed like I was trying to use money to buy you... That's right... You don't have to go on. It was my misunderstanding, thinking you were a bad person. I'm really sorry. And you left like that... I was afraid that I left you with the wrong impression. Fortunately, the misunderstanding has been resolved. Yun Pil Ju really won't do it? He's already said he won't appear. How about the second-best candidate, Mr. Chan Young? Chan Young said he won't participate if a scandalous celebrity is on the program. Who? Is it Gu Ae Jeong? There are plenty of female stars out there. But as for the unknown male candidate, we don't have a lot of options. I heard you're starring in that show. Oh, sunbae told you that I'll participate in the program? As a matter of fact, I will also participate in that program. If in the future we meet at the TV station, please put away all these bad feelings you have toward me. Just treat me as a stranger. I haven't decided yet if I want to appear or not. Yes? Really? You must think about it carefully. Once you're on TV and everyone recognizes you, it can feel really tiring. If you want to maintain your elegant, graceful way of living, it's better not to appear. Yes? I'm still planning to consider it. You definitely shouldn't do it. Since you know the television industry so well, I will heed your advice. Before I go I will give you a set of promotional pictures, and will leave after signing them. Perfect! Really too beautiful! Perfect. Perfect... Stop. Don't clap in front of me. Why? Yesterday I saw something I shouldn't have and also heard a clapping sound. It keeps on reminding me. Sorry, sorry. Sorry, sorry. Dok Go Jin. The theme of the photo shoot this time is being a couple with Se Ri. We have to match the styles, right? I'll choose the style first and then just have her match it. Dok Go Jin, I always get scared looking at the scar on your chest. Will it always be there after a heart surgery? Haven't I said before to pretend not to see it? Sorry. Sir, Candies' Ha Ru Mi is here. Is that right? Let her wait. Fine. You're still sponsoring girl groups? Of course, they are very popular now. Oh, right. Dok Go Jin, Representative Moon asked us under your company's name to sponsor Gu Ae Jeong. Aren't I kind? So busy and popular. The skirt that you wore last time was very beautiful. This is really beautiful! Yeah. This one is too difficult. Can't I wear something else? Okay, okay. Take a look. This one. That one isn't available. That's been reserved for Gu Ae Jeong. Gu Ae Jeong? She and Dok Go Jin are with the same company. I can't refuse. Can't I wear this? It's not really possible as it has already been reserved. Letting someone of Gu Ae Jeong's level wear the dress, as compared to our Ha Ru Mi... Who will make the dress shine more? It's alright. Gu Ae Jeong isn't qualified to complain. Do you know why? It's because the level is different. Okay, I will let her wear something else. That's right, just pick another! Manager Jang. Ah! Mr. Dok Go Jin! We meet here. This dress. I can take it, right? Dok Go Jin, why? Is it for Miss Se Ri? I want to take it. Okay, this one. Then it's like this. I'll take this one. This too. I'll take this too. Right. You wear something else, okay? Then I'll have this. This too. I'll take this too. And... This one too. I need this one. These too. Of course this one, also. I need to take it. Ha Ru Mi, how about the one we first tried? This? This too. I need it. What do you think you're doing? Seeing how red your face is, it looks like you've been slapped. However, yesterday I saw a face that got slapped looking worse than yours. So I'm numb to yours. I have said that I will take all these away. You are not qualified to complain. Do you know why? The level is different. Why am I doing such things? Dok Go Jin, what's wrong with you? Can you wear any of these? After all, I'm just helping a pitiful worm take revenge. I have to get her to take all these away. Why does the production team suddenly want to see me? Is it because they think that Gu Ae Jeong is different from the rest of the actresses? Yes, right. Your phone is still ringing. I'm not supposed to answer this number. -=Reject Number calling=- This number can't be accessed. -=Reject Number calling=- Why does he keep on calling me? He told me not to answer. =User temporarily unable to connect...= Not answering? =Temporarily unable to connect...= Not answering. Gu Ae Jeong, you're going to regret following my orders. What? If she didn't answer because she knew it was me, does that means she still has my number? This woman... What?! I'm being dropped from the program? The male candidate said he wouldn't do the program if you take part. But why doesn't he want Ae Jeong on the program? The general public's distaste towards a performer is easily felt. It's a matter of the candidate's individual viewpoint. And you left like that...  I was afraid that I left you with the wrong impression.  Fortunately, the misunderstanding has been resolved.  Having said all that... You bad person. Yes, I guess we have been bad to you. I am really sorry... Excuse me, phone call. Fact is, we wanted a male candidate different from the one we currently have, but... Negotiation didn't go well. Please, don't misunderstand. Yes. Yes. Do you have any idea how bad the situation has gotten since you said no? I'm sorry to have brought on so much trouble. I thought about it again. What? Further consideration? Are you agreeing to appear? Give me a straight answer. Yes, I'll appear. I also have an agreement to live up to. I think it will be interesting. Could you please reconsider? I will personally meet the male candidate and convince him. That would be too much trouble. So sorry, Miss Gu Ae Jeong. Let's go. Oppa, please do something. Miss Gu Ae Jeong! Don't go, don't go. Why? It's okay. Miss Gu Ae Jeong, you don't have to leave. Our first choice male candidate said he will do it. He said he will? So instead of that man who dislikes me, a different male candidate will be on the program? Yes, right. We feel that the man who dislikes Miss Ae Jeong, he's not that great anyway. Now you don't have to leave. It works out well for everyone. Yes, yes. Thank goodness. Ah, really. Thank goodness. Thank you! Gu Ae Jeong, you. Since when has she started to listen to me about not answering my calls? Hey, it's Dok Go Jin! Why you little... Scared me, there. Wow, you really are Dok Go Jin! Am I your friend? You're my aunt's friend! How do you do? Could it be... Are you Ding Dong from last time? I'm not your aunt's friend. If you call me on the phone like you did last time, I will deal with you. What are you looking at? Amazing. Of course I am. Why does Ajussi's beard say the word "cow"? (Ajussi - Older man, uncle) What? I asked why your beard is shaped like the word "cow." Cow? Cow! Why, you brat... It really says "cow"! Dok Go Jin? What are you doing here? Gu Ae Jeong. Could it be that my mustache...? Mustache? What's wrong? Nothing. Why aren't you picking up your phone? Did you come here to visit me? You didn't answer because you knew it was me, right? That means you put my number into your phone again. You didn't delete my call records. You re-saved my phone number again, right? That... I marked out the number in order to avoid the calls. Did you come here to argue over this? Isn't this a restaurant? Anyone can come to a restaurant. A celebrity like me coming here, it is a supreme honor! Then have dinner and leave, right? Hyeong Kyu, let's go. Let's go. Auntie... Hmm? That ajussi... Ding Dong! It's my opinion that you should shut your mouth. Do you understand? Don't say it. Mr. Dok Go Jin, do you like bone soup? I don't want it. Please take it. Last time, with the taxi fare, you said it was okay not to pay you back. Can you use this as my payment? Then, eat well okay? Say goodbye. Goodbye. Auntie, didn't you say that's really expensive? Yes, it's expensive. But when I think of that bone soup, I'm reminded of that bad doctor's heart. Auntie can't stomach it. Let's go. What is the matter with her? Everyone else is pretty, but she's an eyesore. National Treasure Girls. She is not suitable. She has been criticized a lot lately on the Internet. She won't last. You should eliminate her first. How do you do? Jae Seok called for me. So why are you here? Jae Seok has something urgent to take care of. I'm here as his substitute. Come in. What are you doing here? I came together with my oppa. Wow, you have a nice house. Come in. How come you have so many clothes? What... Stop... Don't touch. All these are women's clothes! Ah! Looks like he has someone here. There's no one! These are mine. These... These are your clothes? When I'm alone at home, I have a habit of wearing whatever clothes I want, too. So Dok Go Jin has this side to him. I only said these are mine, not that I wear them! If you wear that, you will expose these. Stop imagining! - We won't. - We won't. Wait a moment. I have something for the representative. This isn't it. This is unisex style. You have no sense of fashion. Wow! He has a cool game room. Oppa, what are you doing? Don't! Wow. Don't touch anything! He'll be real angry. It's alright. Don't touch anything down there. It's all very expensive. Fine. Oppa, don't kid around! Get up! Don't play with it. Don't play with it. What's wrong? It won't come off. What to do? Oppa, one, two, three. You aren't touching anything, right? -I will report the damages to the police. -Oppa, what to do? Won't it come off? What are we to do, oppa? I'll go... delay him a bit. What? So this is your bedroom. Gu Ae Jeong. Did you drown your food in water when you ate? (meaning: You completely forgot?) How dare you run up here like it's anyplace. Go down. Dok Go Jin! Are you insane? This... Where did you get this mattress? It's good. Where are you sitting? Stand up. It'll get smelly. Wow, it's even better when lying down. You like it that much? Then do you want to sleep here? With me? Shall we lie together, then? Hurry, go down. Dok Go Jin! What now? That... Can't you let me borrow this? What? For the first show, I've prepared a sexy dance. It'll be more funny if I do it with this on than not, right? Is this your prop room? I won't lend it. Then, I'll go borrow one from the prop room. Gu Ae Jeong. You want to go on the program and wear such a thing, and dance like that? That way I won't be eliminated. Even staying on the show a minute longer continues to get me food to eat and live. I staked my life on the Couple Making show. I could do anything. Okay. Sure, get kicked out by the newcomers, and get trampled by your colleagues. Hang in there. Is this your way of supporting me, Mr. Dok Go Jin? Thank you. It'll be quite an accomplishment. -This... -Ae Jeong! I just need to give this to the representative, right? The manager must be really good! Wow, to get sponsored by this kind of place! Oh, Miss Gu Ae Jeong. Hello. Hello. We came to collect the sponsored clothing. Okay, come with me. Yes. Look here. Which dress is mine? Here it is! Which one? All of them. These are all for Miss Gu Ae Jeong's sponsorship. They are for your selection. Really? Yes, that's right. Wow! All the dresses were packed and delivered. But you brought them back. Didn't you send them to Miss Se Ri? I don't know. She wears a different brand now. Oh, so are you giving them to another person? Who knows. Anyway, we're in the same company. It should be a company arrangement, right? What's wrong? No problem at all. You're the boss. Do everything as you wish. Introducing the "reborn" Gu Ae Jeong. Miss Gu Ae Jeong. Hello, everybody, I'm Gu Ae Jeong. As a new artist, I will work twice as hard. ? Because of you, my chest, my heart goes thump thump. ? ? I love only you from the bottom of my heart. ? ? I dream of you with your eyed closed. ? ? I will reach out with my hand. ? Dok Go Jin? What is it about this song? What is it about you? How can it be like this? We will begin the procedure right now. Don't worry. One more time. The test results show no abnormalities. How does your body usually feel? From the beginning, I thought there was something wrong with my heart monitor device. But that wasn't it. Every time I hear that strange song, my heart starts racing. Therefore... You have pain there, right? Yes. Not long ago, there was some. Then clearly every time I hear the song, my heart starts beating faster and faster. What is going on with me? Do I need an operation? Could it be that the artificial part of my heart has some connection with that song? Are you making a science fiction movie? That's true. When your heart surgery was completed, people called you Iron Man, right? Don't laugh at me! But you have miraculously survived. That is almost the same. That is what I am saying. My heart is beating and it is miraculously letting me live. But now, because of this someone... Er, no. Because of this other reason, it is beating nonstop. This is not normal, right? Doctor, am I really okay? Of course, there's nothing unusual. I understand. I will leave first. Dok Go Jin, I think your pains are like what many of us have experienced. What? Have you thought about the possibility that it's because you're in love? That could be the reason your heart races. Doctor, your brain seems to age a lot as you grow older. Anyway, your heart is doing fine. That is good. Yes. I will leave first. Except for the melodramas that you hate, all the other scripts are here. Representative Moon. Do you like romantic movies? I do. Why? I ask you this for my movie research. To see what kind of movie it would be. Two people liking each other. And looking at each other in a corny way. Then adding the exaggerated heartbeat sound effect. That's right. Is it like this in reality? It can't be like the movie since you can't hear the heartbeats. However, you can feel it when your heart starts racing. Then, if I see someone cry and then laugh, and my heart beats faster... Does that mean I like someone? Not necessarily. That's RIGHT! The heart could beat because you see someone who's funny. It is also possible if the person is pitiful. Of course, of course. Because it is funny or pitiful. I can live with that. However, there are situations where you like someone and that's why your heart beats. When is that? When you see her with another guy and your heart beats faster. Then it's certain. You like her. Representative. Of course it's not. Of course, it's not like that. Season 3 of Couple Making will start soon. Just like the first and second seasons, I hope you will continue to watch it. Kang Se Ri, as former National Treasure Girls, how do you feel about working with Ae Jeong again? Although we're only meeting for the first time in 10 years, it's just as comfortable as though we'd parted yesterday. I feel that with my eonni around, my mind is more at ease. Recently there are a lot of combination groups... Kang Se Ri and Gu Ae Jeong, how would you feel about combining to form a new National Treasure Girls? That would be good. Then we could name the combined group National Treasure Sisters. How about it? Sisters. I'm going to go crazy because of Ae Jeong! Who said she could lump me together with her? What? National Treasure Sisters? This is great publicity for our program. That's why we got her in the first place, right? For the sake of the show, I will endure until the first recording. Anyway, she'll be eliminated in the first show, and save me the trouble of seeing her. Though, do we have to eliminate her? What? Gu Ae Jeong has been on a lot of programs lately. She has thoroughly imprinted the "unlikeable" image. Instead of eliminating her so soon, isn't it more interesting if we keep her on longer? The one who leaves the greatest impression is usually the one who people dislike. How can we just drop her like that? No matter what, Gu Ae Jeong is our biggest asset right now. But that... Since this is a new season, how about we try something new? By getting rid of the one who is not likable. We can take this chance to change everything. How does that sound? Oh, the posters are out, hyeong? No wonder it is so popular. It has five famous and pretty female celebrities. Fifth, fourth, third, second, first. Gu Ae Jeong is the first. Do you like her? First in the ugly ranking. In the Internet voting, Gu Ae Jeong is also first. What? First to be eliminated in the first round. It's from the Internet voting. Is Gu Ae Jeong ranked first? Of course! The first to be kicked off the show. I almost forgot. I should vote too. Who should I vote for, hyeong? I don't know, I'm not interested. I should vote for Gu Ae Jeong, right? Since we're part of the same company. No, I should vote for Ha Ru Mi. Ha Ru Mi? Gu Ae Jeong? Ha Ru Mi? Gu Ae Jeong? Ha Ru Mi? Gu Ae Jeong? Or voting for the young and beautiful Ha Ru Mi! Yeah! What was that about the Taiwanese drama? They've invited you to be part of it. You have some lines in the script, I've already highlighted them in yellow. Yellow makes my eyeballs hurt. I have to watch out for that. Change it to blue. What? You don't want to do it? Of course not, I'll replace it. Don't take the PC tablet. Hyeongnim. Tomorrow is the first recording. The first recording. Will there be an elimination? Yes, at the very end. What will you do when you get eliminated? Even if I am eliminated, there will still be games and interviews. So I will still be on air for two or three weeks. Once the program starts, there will be an elimination in the first five minutes. This will create a tense atmosphere right at the start. Not bad right? Whoever gets eliminated won't even get five minutes of airtime. I guess that Gu Ae Jeong will be the one. Ah! Gu Ae Jeong sees me everyday and shows me her new variety skills. No one will vote for Ae Jeong unnie anyway. The possibility of that scenario happening is obvious. Wow, that's it! So cool. And see? Wow, this is the latest model. Hey, this must be very comfortable to drive, right? Oppa, I first met Dok Go Jin when he was in this van. At that time, I thought it was a foreign car. I never thought I'd get to ride in this van. Just from the likes of you?! This is my private vehicle. Besides, you're not even on the same level as me to have this car. The agency director said I could take it. Besides, this is a company car. It doesn't belong to you. I am the company. Jae Seok, tomorrow this van should be reserved for me. It should be waiting at my door at seven o'clock sharp. There's no schedule tomorrow. I want to take a drive around Seoul in my van. Who wakes up early in the morning just to do that? Hey, Kim Jae Seok, are you crazy? Stop honking! How do you do? Hey! You! Throw this out, will you? Gu Ae... Gu Ae Jeong, you! That van... Hey! I feel so much better! Ae Jeong, since we have our revenge, we're off to the recording studio, then. Fighting! Sure, oppa. How do you do? Ah, hello! Hello, hello. Oh, Gu Ae Jeong. You look so happy today. Haven't seen the script yet, right? Is there something strange with the script? Since it was like this, why would they ask you to learn some special dance? Why is everyone so certain I'll be eliminated first? I know I'll have enough time, I prepared something special. I'll do my sexy dance and then leave. But my first impression isn't that bad. Who knows? Maybe a handsome man will see me and fall under my spell. Gu Ae Jeong arrived at my house this morning and left with my van. After the show, I want you to get her. Immediately. Let her have it just for today, hyeongnim. Once her section in the show is finished, she'll probably be really depressed. Why would she be depressed? Because it's likely that right after her section is done... she'll be eliminated. What? Didn't she say that she'll try her hardest for this program? What's wrong? Hello, I am Gu Ae Jeong. Hello! I am Gu Ae Jeong. -=Reject Number calling=- Yes, is something wrong? Gu Ae Jeong, don't be in the show. Just come back to the agency, now. Do that and I'll get you any other deal, be it a CF or a movie. Just tell the producers you're not going to do it and come back. Dok Go Jin, why would you want me to do that? I'm carrying on. Don't go! Are you stupid enough to continue when you're about to be humiliated? Why is that so bad? Didn't you hear what I said? Are my words that confusing? They're perfectly clear. But I'm already aware of that, so it's fine. I always strive to finish any show, regardless. I'm hanging up. Are you really not going to listen, Gu Ae Jeong?! For this program, I'm going to do my best.  So I must be willing to do anything.  Who is going to be matched up with Gu Ae Jeong? An ordinary man. Looks like I'll have to go myself and match that ordinary man with Gu Ae Jeong. It's unfortunate that you didn't have more time for consideration. I guess you'll have to just choose by first impression after all. But it should be fine. You are on a program with professionals. Even if you don't like them, there's no need to feel guilty. I know. This was my decision, after all. So just choose those with the best first impression, and don't feel bad. Exactly! Hello everyone, I am Couple Making Season 3's matchmaking host, Kang Se Ri. In the wake of the light and gentle spring breeze, blows a secretive love story. The matchmaking has formally started. The time that everyone's been waiting for has arrived. The production team spent a lot of time and energy on the selection for today, and they chose a very handsome man. Now, secret guest, please come forward. Everybody, please give him a round of applause. Hello, I'm the head doctor at an oriental medicine hospital, Yun Pil Ju. Not bad-looking, right? Well, Mr. Yun Pil Ju, please take a look at every female guest. You have three seconds. Okay, the three seconds are over. -=Women's Dressing Room=- Okay, you've had your first impressions. You are now to choose someone based on that moment. Mr. Yun Pil Ju, please offer roses to the female guests you're most optimistic about. Which guest of Mr. Yun Pil Ju will be eliminated? Good. All right. He has now given away three. Now we have the last rose. Who will it be? Top star Kim Hee Jin? Or "National Treasure" Gu Ae Jeong? One of them will be eliminated. Who will be the first to be eliminated in the third season of "Couple Making"? Then, Yun Pil Ju, please give the final rose. When you see her with some other guy, and your heart also beats faster. Only then will you know for sure... You like her.
