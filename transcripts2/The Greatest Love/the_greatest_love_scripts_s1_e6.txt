 Watch the movie by yourself. I'm not going inside. Coming here is the farthest I can go. I'm going to come to my senses and go back. I even bought the coke and popcorn you talked about. I even bought potatoes. Why are you doing this? Those potatoes really scare me. Are you avoiding me because you’re scared I'll catch your chicken and harass you? Yes, I'm scared.

 I'm scared that I don't avoid you. Honestly, I'm scared because I don't feel harassed by you. I want to be cool about this whole situation. I went through a lot during the ten years and I learned my lesson. I'm scared I'll forget what I learned just from getting butterflies at my age. I think you're not afraid of anything since you're mad at me. But what will you do if I ask you to not let go of me? So please just stop now. FIGHTER Gu... I'm not going to let go of you. What are you going to do? Will you let me hold onto you,

 or will you run away? I won't catch you again. It's too embarrassing. What are you going to do? Let go? Should I let go? Why are you touching me in public? What if someone sees us? Let go of me before people recognize us. What are you doing? Stay still. If people recognize us, it'll be because of you. I can't see. Keep your head down so you won't. Where are we going? Be quiet and follow me. I've caught you. That's not it! They were here for sure. There are two drinks, so he definitely had company. Who is she? A celebrity? Who is it? Is she more famous than I am? It was bound to happen. I guess the rumor that they already broke up was true. They won't announce the breakup while our show is running, right? She has a lot going on with Jin, so they’ll try to hide it for now. Wait, but who is the woman he came with? She must be a top celebrity like Se-ri. If news of his new romance is released before his breakup with Se-ri, she'll become the immoral person that caused the affair. "Cause the affair"? But it's not an affair if they already broke up. That's true for her, but to everyone else, it's an affair. People believe Jin and Se-ri are still a couple. No one will misunderstand us. If Shin Min-a or Han Ye-seul was sitting there, it might be different. But it's Gu Ae-jeong. It’s a relief that I’m not a top actress. If you wanted a scandal with me, you should at least try to look the part. Do you think people will think I would date a woman dressed like that? Good thing I dressed this shabby. Despite your shabby clothes and lack of status, you still manage to pain Dokgo Jin. It's very admirable. Jin. Was liking me that painful? I’ve never liked anyone but myself. So it's painful, and the fact it had to be you is truly embarrassing. It must've been painful. Since on top of being embarrassed, you were dumped. Don't say that word. It's bringing back the shock I felt. Were you that shocked? I guess you didn't expect that I'd refuse you. Of course, not in the slightest. I thought you’d grab the opportunity like a great prize. -If I grabbed it? -I'd let myself be grabbed. I thought the pain of being grabbed would wake me straight up. If I grabbed you then, you would've woken straight up and dumped me like that. It would've been easy if you grabbed it, wake me up, and get dumped. Seriously. Grab, wake up, dump. It would've been really easy. Right? Stop picking my words apart and lose the bitter face. Jin. You said you never liked anyone but yourself, right? I guess I'm your first love. Stop it. That's embarrassing. Do you want more? You're so evil and selfish, your first love at that age will never come true. Because I will never ever like you back. Wait. Hey, Ae-jeong! Let go. Let's cancel this and start over. Before you came here, you should've been treated like a princess, with fancy dresses. You needed to lose your wits first, but we skipped that step. Let's do that and come back. I'll make it happen. Don't go. If you have that money, just give it to me. What? Then I’ll react the way you wanted me to. Right here, fast and easy. I'll grab the money, so you can come to your senses and dump me. What is it that I wanted you to do? Dokgo Jin, you look so easy. Do you want to sleep with me? What? You woke straight up, right? I'll be off like that. Hey, Ae-jeong... Holding onto her was a good move... We shouldn't have had wine. I told her that I thought she would be easy. Now it's gotten really difficult. FIGHTER For this shooting, we'll have a contest to determine the venue of your date. Have a look. "A sweet picnic, a refreshing hike, a romantic cruise and a luxurious dinner." Since we don’t know who will get which venue, please make sure to keep your schedules flexible. I don’t think everyone has fully built their character yet. Especially you, Ae-jeong. Your clingy, idiotic character is funny. Why don’t you pursue it? Aren't you worrying too much about your bad reputation? How about this? I'll be more clingy, if the MC helps out. Like Yoo Jae-seok or Kang Ho-dong, liven the atmosphere and encourage the guests to act up. There was a one-legged fight scene here. If I challenge you to a one-legged fight scene, take the challenge. Please. That's a great idea! Okay? It's completely set up for a field day. They’ve gone all out. Win first place, pick the hike, and ask him to teach you to ride a bike. Hiking will have the most to do. How can I make people laugh today? Let's see. Wait. This is helium. Hold on. Ae-jeong. Isn't this funny? Try it. It's awesome! Let me try. Ae-hwan. This is so funny! -If you do this, it'll be a hit! -It's so funny. I'll go tell the director, okay? Ae-hwan! Ae-jeong. Pil-joo. What's with your voice? I drank helium. You must've been confused at the theater. Something came up, so I had to hide. Did you tell anyone? -No. -Thank you so much. Gosh, I'm being serious right now, but my voice is so funny. I need to get my voice back. It's back now, right? Is it okay? This is pretty funny. Let me try. You don’t have to try to be funny. But you want me to share my resource? Just one puff, come on. You'll do it during the shoot? If it's funny, yes. I'm an entertainer now, too. Ae-jeong. Is it funny? It's hilarious when a normal person like you does it! I sound like a sneaky doctor. Who are you again? -It's so funny! -Really? They must've gotten really close. I guess he won't eliminate Ae-jeong the next round either. Is it okay to inhale too much of it? Ae-jeong, I was really worried. Right? My head might hurt if I inhale too much of it. Yes. I was worried you'd get very hurt. I don't want you to be hurt. If you're hurt, come to me. I'll cure you. Okay. I think you're a really good doctor. You really didn't see the woman with Jin? No, I didn't see her. There definitely is someone. Who could it be? Just in case, what if he was dating a low-class celebrity? What would you do? Do you think Jin would do something like that and ruin his reputation? What if, though? What if? I would send him overseas. As for the girl, I'll make sure she never steps foot in this industry again. Do you think he'd let you do that? I would do it behind his back. Isn't that the agency's job? I've worked so hard to preserve his reputation. I can't let some low-class affair ruin it. Last night, Se-ri and her team went to the same theater you were at. -You didn't see her? -No. I didn't even see Jae-seok, whom you sent to spy on me. Se-ri seemed to have been embarrassed in front of her team. I’m going to comfort her by sending flowers and a cake to the studio under your name. You’ve officially been together for one year now, so it can be an excuse. Which studio? -The one for Couple Making, by any chance? -Yes. I'll take them to her myself. -Really? -Yes. I should if I don't want to be dumped like that. That's right. It'll be much more effective if you went yourself. Ms. Moon. Am I really that evil? Why, all of a sudden? Those things never bothered you. That's true. But my personality keeps causing problems. Difficult ones. You find something difficult? Yes. It gets more and more difficult. Let's start right away. Ready. Begin! ONE-LEGGED CHICKEN FIGHT TO PICK THE DATE VENUE -The match has begun. -Yes. -Ae-jeong looks weak. -Yes, she does. I think she will be the first to lose. Go Ae-jeong! She is very skilled. The final winner is Ae-jeong! Ae-jeong, this means that... Her persistence and passion were quite surprising, right? You're still the national chicken leg that you used to be. No. Wasn't the national chicken leg of the National Treasure Girls you? No way. I didn't know that. Is it true? She won all the one-legged fights in entertainment programs. She even landed a commercial with it! -Do you remember, Se-ri? -Yes. Then I guess we can't move on without taking a look at the footage. Let's take a look! Find the chicken commercial. Pretend we saw it. Goodness! That was ten years ago. We were so young. We can't continue without watching their one-legged match, right? -Show us! -If the MC accepts me challenge, why not? If you all want me to, of course I'll do it. But it wouldn't be fun without a bet. Let's make a bet. Shall we? If Ae-jeong wins, we'll double the time she gets on the date. If I win, I'll go on the date instead of Ae-jeong. Guess I'll have to win. Guess I can't lose, either. Let's begin the match. Let’s see which of the two will become the queen of this game. It’s making me nervous. We'll begin the match. Ready. Begin! -Kang Se-ri! -Kang Se-ri! Ae-jeong used a lot of energy today... -Gu Ae-jeong! -Gu Ae-jeong! -Gu Ae-jeong! -Gu Ae-jeong! That's right. I used to be the national chicken leg. But I never got to hold a chicken leg. GEUDAE CHICKEN Because of Geudae Chicken My heart beats faster Chicken is my only love The crunchiness that fills my mouth With two arms wide open You've become my chicken again The best chicken... Cut, cut! Ae-jeong should be holding the chicken leg. Why is Se-ri holding it? Se-ri, take the chicken wing. Se-ri, do you want to stand in front? Forget it. He says you’re the chicken leg. I’m a wing, so I’ll go to the back. Hurry, let's go! The best chicken I'll give it all to you -Kang Se-ri! -Kang Se-ri! Things are different now. I'm the MC, and you're a nobody! -Gu Ae-jeong! -Gu Ae-jeong! -Gu Ae-jeong! -Gu Ae-jeong! Gu Ae-jeong is really strong. -Gu Ae-jeong! -Gu Ae-jeong! Nice! PAIN RELIEVER Here. Thank you. You’re really good at chicken fighting. Right? Another week on television was on the line. It was life or death. Can you ride a bike well? The truth is, I can’t. I have to practice. But since my character is such a clingy idiot, don’t get upset and bear with me when I cling onto you and ask you to teach me. Be as clingy as you want. I’m now an entertainer, too. The doctor I respect the most is the renowned Yi Je-ma. How did I end up as an entertainer? Yi Je-ma? That's a good line. Can I bring it up to you during the shoot? Let me write it down. My pen... Here. I'll give the funny line to you. Yi Je-ma helped the ill, but Pil-joo the entertainer will help Ae-jeong. That's pretty catchy. Thank you. Is this your special pen? Yes. Use it well and return it to me. Excuse me. I have to go see Eun-ho. -Okay. -I'll see you later. Hello. How charming. Oriental medicine doctor... Yi... Ma... Yi Je-ma! You scared me! What do you want? You’re very good at one-legged chicken fights. You were like a rooster. Your chicken act was incredible! "Chicken act"? Is it humorous to watch me make a living? The things you say... It was a compliment. I just said chicken act to be funny. It's not funny at all. You think that corny Pil-joo is hilarious. Can’t you just pretend I’m funny, too? I laugh because Pil-Joo is actually funny and pleasant. Fine. Just keep laughing to look good in front of him. Your clingy, annoying character is a good concept. It really suits you. Make the show hilarious! So, you're saying I'm clingy and I have a reputation for being easy? Are you ridiculing me? They were words of encouragement. It’s not encouraging at all. If you came to bother me, go over there. Over there! I came to impress you. I was trying to support you. It was hard, but I wanted to impress you! I wasn't calling you cheap and easy! If you're going to support me, you could do it nicely. I guess it’s because you have an asshole for a mouth. Anything that comes out of it is poop. But you can still try to hold it in. Even your real asshole holds poop in until you reach the bathroom. So, before you open your mouth, try to hold it in and determine whether to open it by assessing the situation. And then open it. Are you giving me advice right now? If so, you could do it nicely. I want to say it’s because you’re lame and anything you say comes out crass... But I'll hold it in and not say anything. Fine. In any case, thanks for the support. I’ll try my best on the show and last until the last round. And I'll make sure to be a couple with Pil-Joo. What? Be a what with who? A couple. This show is called Couple Making. That’s right. It’s that kind of show. I think things will work out. Pil-Joo thinks highly of me. It will be amazing if I last until the end. Gu Ae-jeong. That belongs to that doctor, right? -Yes. -Give it to me. Isn't it really nice? He said it was a special gift. He’ll probably get mad at you if you lose it. Probably. What are you doing? Tell him you lost it, so he can get mad at you. What? You’re going to have to like me. You need to leave this show. Are you crazy? Stop it! Seriously, Jin! What am I going to do? What do I do? How can I find this? How am I going to find this? Is this an event for Se-ri? Dokgo Jin is so attentive, just like his reputation. Yes, well... He’s always like this to Se-ri. Se-ri is actually feeling pretty down and won’t come out of her van. This is great. Mr. Dokgo can cheer her up before he leaves. Good idea. Hey, Kim Jae-seok, the cake-- -Hello! -Hello! Hello. Hello. I see you were in a meeting. Jae-seok, shall we get going? Mr. Dokgo, please help us. Se-ri is in a really bad mood right now. Do you have a surprise event to cheer her up? We need to continue the shoot. Please save us. Isn't it your anniversary? If you had something planned, please feel free to do it here. Yes, help us out. -Help us. -Please help us. Then, I guess I’ll have to help you. I will plan a special event for her. Thank you! -What a relief! -We're good now! -Seriously. -Let's help him. -I'm so jealous of Se-ri. -She's so lucky! Damn it! What am I going to do? It’s not here! My sneaker! Oh, my sneaker! Dokgo Jin, I'll bury you with in these balls! It’s Jae-seok. Where are you? Jin is waiting in the dressing room. The dressing room? Why, hello? Ms. Gu? What are you doing? I’m throwing an event. An event? -Are you trying to impress me? -You seem upset. Just pause and let me explain the situation-- Shut your asshole! I was going to try to understand and let it go, but I don't think I can. Ms. Gu? I don't need your compliments or encouragements. The pen you lost. What are you doing to do about it? Find it. Ms. Gu-- And stop lurking around me and get lost! I will never, ever like you! What is this? Be careful! Ae-jeong, you seem to be very upset because of all the bad press you've gotten because of me. Is it hard to accept the apology I delivered with compliments and encouragements? As for the pen you lost, I think you meant fan, which you gain through fan meetings or other events with your fans. What good does it do to talk to me? -Could you take this? -Yes. In any case, to hear that you will never ever like me is very regretful. Sorry. What's wrong with her? -What's going on? -What the... -Unbelievable. -She's hopeless. -What is she thinking? -Seriously. -I know. -She's so unlikeable. That was so harsh. What do we do? TOP MALE STAR "A" HUMILIATED BY RIOT WOMAN "C"! "Top male celebrity A is humiliated by a lunatic female C during an event for his girlfriend B. C had always held a grudge against A and made a racket, going as far as to swinging a prop which shocked the staff standing by. C and B are both from the same girl group." “Girl Group C” is the top search keyword. Followed by "Gu Ae-jeong." The internet is really scary. No matter how you read it, it all points to Ae-jeong. Ae-jeong, let’s eat. I don’t want to eat, Dad. My goodness. CAMELLIA FLOWER She must be really upset. AE-JEONG, I SCREWED UP. I'M... "I'm so sorry..." I will never, ever like you. Who told you to come inside and yell like that? Why is this so difficult? I'm really sorry. I told the prop staff to call me when they empty the ball pool. -I’ll look for it then. -Let's find it together. You lost your sneaker, too. I don’t know why I’m so unlucky these days. I think I’m going to explode. Keep hitting that spot. What? This is a pressure point that relieves anger when you hit it. You were instinctively healing yourself. My hand just went to this spot. People are meant to find their own paths. Things will work out. Really? Of course. Having faith is the most crucial part of healing. Somehow, I have faith in whatever you say. COUPLE MAKING 3 The prop staff is here. Okay. It's getting chilly... Why is it so heavy? Sir! Did you find the pen? -What pen? -I called you. I asked you to look for a pen in the ball pool. Okay. You have to be sure to call me. -Alright then. -She'll feel bad if it's not found. You have my number, right? It’s Gu Ae-jeong. Okay. Things are getting too difficult because of our relationship. You should know that I'll be settling things soon through my agency soon. Is it because of the A and B article? Blaming it on C sorted it all out. Yes, C shed all the blood. Ae-jeong really has the worst timing. Why did she explode there? Just like before. -When? -During the National Treasure Girls era. The day Ae-jeong yelled at me a ton of reporters happened to be around. What did you do wrong to her? -What? -You must've done something wrong for her to yell at you. I didn't do much. You didn’t do anything, but she yelled at you anyway. I did do something. What did you do? I was just playing with her. But... do you really hate Ae-jeong that much? What did you do to her? Did you provoke her? It's embarrassing to think that I acted the same way you did. Ae-jeong says she hates you, too. Just avoid each other. After that incident, I didn't see her for ten years. Ten years... That's too long. You and I will be officially over shortly. What? Where are you going? -Please come in. -All right. This is it. Thank you for letting me in. You’re Dokgo Jin! Of course I have to open it. My wife is a fan. I'll ask you for an autograph when you leave? Of course. I don’t know if you’ll find it, since this place is so big. -I’ll get going. -Okay. All right. Search as if your life depends on it. Yes, sir! COUPLE MAKING MBS PROP ROOM Mr. Dokgo! I found them. FOR MY SON Thank you. Is this what you’re looking for? Yes. It's the same one I lost. I'll take this. It's obvious that A is Dokgo Jin, B is Kang Se-ri and C is Gu Ae-jeong. What to do with C? She acts as lame as she is. Her nickname isn't Ankle Girl now, it's Riot Girl. -It's Riot Girl because she caused a riot? -Yes. That is so funny. I should tell my son to stay away from her. Hello. Is Dr. Yun in? It's Se-ri's father. Hello! Why, hello. My daughter went through an unfortunate situation, so I wanted to ask Dr. Yun about it. He stepped out for a moment. I saw the news yesterday. It's about A, B, and C, right? You must be so upset. You look really weak. -Nurse! -Yes? Bring the gongjin-dan. Here it is. Here, you should have one right now. It's very good to have one every day. I feel stronger just by chewing it. Ask your daughter to buy you some. Se-ri makes a lot of money. I'm giving you these because you're her father. These costs 200 thousand won each. It costs 200 thousand won? Wait, then. There are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8... That’s 2 million won! I'm giving them to you because you’re Se-ri’s dad. No... The truth is, my daughter is... Ae-jeong... Well... 200,000 WON TOTAL 2 MILLION WON My daughter is great! Se-ri will be very thankful. Thank you. Hey, Ding Dong! Hello! Your aunt won't pick up my calls. Is she home? She said she would stay home today. When you go home, tell her to pick up my call. If she won't, pick it up for her. Okay. -You can go. -Goodbye. Seeing Gu Ae-jeong's face is basically asking for the moon. She'll feel better if I return this, but I really don't want her to get close to the doctor. Who's that? You’re not supposed to talk to strangers. It’s Dokgo Jin. Dokgo Jin? You’re lying! It really is Dokgo Jin! -You're lying! -I'm telling you it really is Dokgo Jin! -You're lying! -You're lying! He's not lying! I'm Dokgo JIn, and we know each other. If you have a phone, you can take pictures. -Really? -That's right. Take a picture as proof to show how incredible this guy is. Come on. Like this. Like this. Like this. Okay, auntie. I told my aunt to pick me up, so she'll come here. Good. Nice job. Don't your friends know that your aunt is famous? I didn't tell them. My aunt told me to never say anything. I guess that's wise. If you have a bad reputation your family is also mocked. Hey, Ding Dong. You can tell everyone that we're really close. I’ll send your class 100 autographs. Distribute them. Thank you. What's that? It’s a lie detector. Let me see. If you’re lying, the light is red and it tells you you’re lying. You're lying, aren't you? You shouldn't lie. It's a fake lie detector that lies that it's a lie detector. But isn't it a lie to say that we're close when we're not? Can I lie? -Say that we’re close. -We're close. No red light. Since it’s not a lie, you can say it. -Answer me, Ding Dong. -Okay. Very good. Alarm has been disarmed. Where’s Hyeong-gyu? Hyeong-gyu! Let’s go. Wake up. What are you doing? So I didn't pick up the phone. You used him to bring me? That's not it. I was driving by and he kept following me so I had to bring him. Do you really think I waited in front of your nephew’s school and coaxed him to call you over just to make you come here? I’m Dokgo Jin, okay? Just because you said you'll never, ever like me, do you think I would do something like that? -If it's not the case, fine. -It's not! I'm not going to hold onto you anymore. Don't. That's good news. -You’re disappointed, right? -What? You were shocked when I said I wouldn’t hold onto you, right? What are you talking about? I’m not. -Don't lie. -I'm not lying! This is a lie detector. If you’re lying, it beeps and a red light turns on. Tell the truth. What are you doing with a toy? Kids are precious. Swear on your dear Ding Dong. If you lie, then he'll live with that body forever. What? If you want your Ding Dong to end up with an awesome body like mine, don’t lie and tell the truth. Weren't you disappointed? Aren't you disappointed that I wouldn’t hold onto you? No. You're lying, aren't you? -You shouldn't lie. -You're lying! Get that away from me. -So, it’s a lie. -Get that away! Are you all right? I got hit by Pororo's head. It hurts so much. It aches and throbs. Are you okay? No, I'm not. I almost busted my eye. Dokgo Jin got hit by Pororo. It's better than saying you got hit by me. At least Pororo is a top star. It is a bit red. Do you think a vein popped? I have to go to Japan for a promotion. Let me see. Look at me straight in the eye. It looks okay at this angle. This way. This way. It looks okay this way, too. This side is redder. It looks fine up close. What a relief. Ae-jeong. I'm going to talk now. Turn the lie detector on. I think... you are hard to get. You're not someone who is easy. You're a difficult person. If I find that doctor's pen, will you cancel the thing about never ever liking me? If you find it, I’ll at least forgive you. Just forgive? I guess for someone who hates being easy, it’ll be too embarrassing to cancel their words so easily. I'll have to make sure you can cancel them without being embarrassed. I'll be in Japan from tomorrow to promote Fighter, you need to do something for me. Come here... and feed them. Why would you ask me to do that? My security system will be activated when I leave. Only you know the security code to deactivate it. You didn’t change 6090? That's right. Only you can enter. I won't give it to anyone else. Without you, they'll all starve. It's not my fault if they do. Why should I enter your world? Activate... the lie detector in your heart. Then, you'll end up in my world. Activate... the lie detector in your heart. I will never, ever like Dokgo Jin. You’re lying. You shouldn’t lie. You shouldn’t lie. She’ll find it after feeding them a couple times. Once she does, forgiving and canceling won't be so embarrassing. How do I tell her I found it without making it look like a lie? This is hard. I need to tell Ae-jeong I found it. It'll make her feel better. Hey, Hyeong-gyu. Were you all really at Dokgo Jin’s house? Yes, we’re really close. Not you. What did your aunt and Mr. Dokgo talk about? I didn't hear anything. That's what you should've been listening to! Mr. Dokgo's popularity in Japan is no joke. If he appears in your music video when you release your album, you might be able to experience the Korean wave. Mr. Gu, you're getting ahead of yourself. Ae-jeong, I’ve done my investigation. You saved his number as Camellia Flower, so when will that flower bloom? You're tripping over yourself. Se-ri! Let’s take the picture for your post here. Hold on! Give me the eye drops from France. Okay. Will Jin really announce the breakup? Yes. Before that happens, I need to look sad. Then I won't be hated as much. What about the billion won commercial? I don't know. Thinking about that makes me want to cry. It's so upsetting. Take it. Is it okay? I'm so upset. The alarm has been disarmed. Hello. So what if I came? Your owner lost a billion won commercial. Imagine how upset he'd be if you all starved, too. It might be my fault so I came because I feel bad. Eat up. Please don't edit out Ae-jeong. When her album comes out, please air her music video after the show! Ae-jeong is going to release an album? And we’re thinking about... having a top celebrity like Dokgo Jin in the music video. But they don’t get along. That’s not true. Mr. Gu said that? Ms. Moon. I’ve known Ae-jeong since her debut. I’ll give you some advice. Don’t invest in her. If you’re talking about her scandal, I know all there is to know. No. Not the real reason why the National Treasure Girls broke up. Their breakup wasn't... just because of the incident with Se-ri? There were other problems? My past incident with Ae-jeong? Jin asked me the same thing too. He asked about the incident with Ae-jeong? Are you trying to find dirt about me since we’re breaking up? "Breaking up"? Dokgo wants to end our relationship soon. You haven’t heard yet? When did he say that? After the gossip news that came out because of Ae-jeong. What exactly did Ae-jeong say to Jin that day? She burst into the room swearing that she would never, ever like him. Really? The difficult problem Jin mentioned was Ae-jeong? No way. It can't be... GU AE-JEONG Hey everyone! It's time for food. Here we go. I should fill this up before I leave. Since you returned early, you weren't harassed at the airport. Are you okay? I never feel good after a plane ride. -Should we go to a hospital? -Forget it. Take me home. I wonder if there's less fish food. It didn’t go down at all. She didn’t even come once? Did you all starve? SENT BY MBS PROP ROOM The sender is MBS prop room -and the recipient is Gu Ae-jeong? -Yes. Delivery! Thank you very much. It’s Pil-Joo’s pen. They found it! See, I told you so. The staff found it and delivered it to my house. It is yours, right? It really is! I found it thanks to you. You lost it because of me. I felt really bad. Since we found it, you don't have to be sorry. Don't you feel better? I was really worried. It's so expensive. Since you found it for me, I'll treat you to dinner. I'll buy you the most delicious dish at your friend's restaurant. Can I let you treat me? -Remember, it's an expensive pen. -Right? FOR MY SON Do I really have to give this to her directly? Mr. Dokgo, what are you doing here? Mr. Gu, what are you doing here? This is my house. Are you here to see Ae-jeong? I just came because I need to give her something. Ae-jeong is at Jenny's restaurant down the street. -Really? -Are you going there? Well, I have something to give her. Instead of that, you should wait for her inside. Ae-jeong is waiting for the doctor. Who? The doctor she's doing the show with. They're not that close but Ae-jeong found something he lost so he's just buying her dinner. Please, come inside. There's something I wanted to discuss with you. Discuss what? Ae-jeong is preparing an album right now. So, I thought I’d discuss her music video or album promotion with you. That's for Ms. Moon. -Here. -Pil-joo's coming. Put lots of toppings on the pizza! Don’t worry. I’m on Pil-joo’s side. Pil-joo's side? CAMELLIA FLOWER Are you in Japan? What are you doing? -I'm out for dinner. -With who? Pil-joo is buying me dinner. The doctor? You lost his precious pen, but he’s buying you dinner? I found his pen. -You really did? -Yes. So, you asked him to buy you dinner because you found it? Well, since I found it. It’s an expensive pen. You must have impressed him by finding something so expensive. I should impress him. We're on the same show. You really tried hard to impress him. Keep it up. He just hung up. She wanted to impress him so badly, she lied? PLUTO -Ae-jeong! -Hi, Ae-hwan. Did you see Dokgo Jin? No, he's in Japan. Not at all. I just saw him in front of our house. He had something for you. I said you were there. -He's not here. -Really? Anyway, he said he had to see you, be sure to mention your album and the music video. Okay? Stop it already! Bye. Seriously... If he called knowing I was here, why did he hang up? Guess he got upset that I'm having dinner with Pil-joo. I’m leaving right now. I’ll be there in ten minutes. I’m glad that you haven’t left yet. I think we have to postpone our dinner. Really? Next time, I'll buy. -I'm sorry. -It's okay. Bye. I said I’d forgive him if I found the pen, so I'll forgive him. They're selling potatoes. Should I feed him too while feeding the fish? She's made it so difficult for me. But she lies so easily to the doctor. I was disarmed too easily. -What? -Mr. Dokgo. If you see Ae-jeong, please discuss your album and music video positively. -What? -The thing is Ae-jeong can't seem to bring it up herself. He just hangs up like that... Jin! Alarm has been disarmed. Jin, I'm here. What about the doctor? Why are you here? Our plans were canceled. My brother told me you came to my house. So? Since you came all the way over, I thought maybe something was up. I have no business with you. Do you have business with me? Your brother wanted to discuss your album and music video. Are you here to discuss that? Ae-jeong, am I that easy? It's nothing like that. I came to forgive and cancel. Since I found the pen. Stop lying. Just tell me what you need from me. -What's gotten into you? -Should I make it easy? I'll help you release your album and I'll be in your music video. So sleep over tonight. -What? -You're easy to me now. Sleep with me. Let's just end it here, quickly and easily. I shouldn't have come. -Thank you. -Was it good? It was really good. Be sure to come with Ae-jeong next time. Okay. See you. -Goodbye. -Bye. PLUTO Ae-jeong! Please pretend you didn't see me. I’m so embarrassed. What’s wrong? I’m just hurt. It hurts, so that’s why I’m crying. It doesn’t help when I press here, or when I hit here. What do I do when I keep crying? At times like this... This is good. What a jerk. Don't look. You're Dokgo Jin. Don't look. Subtitle translation by
