 The beginning of the new couple. Miss Gu Ae Jeong and Mr. Yun Pil Ju. Everybody, please congratulate the new couple. Mr. Yun Pil Ju's face lights up with a smile. - On becoming Couple Making's third couple, - Since we are on-screen, - our sincere congratulations. - we have to keep holding hands. - The atmosphere is filled with love. - It's embarrassing, isn't it? Let us all truly be in love. Just imagine for a moment that there's no one else here, okay? I was already thinking that. That's what I've been thinking all along. Didn't I say before that I'm sincere? What I'm holding... It's your heart that came to me. I'm really sorry.

 Because of me, you've been pulled into this messy situation. Even so, I was the one who jumped in to hold you. So I will not give up easily. - You've worked hard. - You've worked hard. Goodbye. Be careful. Today wasn't so bad! When Miss Ae Jeong came out, Mr. Yun Pil Ju's reaction was a little strange. Did you say something to Mr. Yun Pil Ju, Se Ri? The microphone was off, so we didn't hear anything. What did you say? Mr. Yun Pil Ju, I like you. After I spoke, what was Mr. Yun Pil Ju's reaction? He was surprised at first but relaxed when he saw Miss Gu Ae Jeong walking towards him. - Mmm. - Mmm. So it's like that? - You've worked hard. That's a wrap everyone! - The shooting has wrapped up. I didn't treat it as a shoot. It was real for me, so I'm just going to keep holding on. Let's go. =I asked Mr. Yun beforehand. Are you in his car now?= Oh... You must really thank him for me then. Something suddenly came up. I had to go to a funeral. I'm here together with Father. Who passed away? What? That... Father's distant uncle's brother, Jang ajussi. (Ajussi- Older man, uncle) Anyway, I will stay here with Father until sunrise. And then... Hyeong Kyu... Jenny's taking care of him, don't worry. Celebrate finishing your first shoot with Mr. Yun. Relax for a bit and have fun. I'm hanging up. He even uses a funeral as an excuse. The people around Miss Gu Ae Jeong are all on Team Pil Ju. That gives me strong support. Did my oppa say something like "Team Pil Ju"? (Oppa - Older brother, boyfriend) No, it was Miss Jenny. Everybody has an opinion. Miss Gu Ae Jeong should quickly join Team Pil Ju too. What are the benefits of joining Team Pil Ju? Well, the benefits of joining Team Pil Ju are... Security, comfort, and stability. And it's solid. It won't break for a lifetime. Hyeong Kyu, your grandfather and father aren't home. So let's go to my house, okay? The kimbap that you need for tomorrow's outing, I'll make that for you too. I'll make it really delicious for you. What about Auntie? Your aunt has a very important date, so she'll be home late. Don't interfere, okay? Welcome! I'll change my clothes at home and come back again. What should I say? Because I'm scared, I can't even call. I just think it's strange. Something's strange because of my broken heart monitor. Ding Dong, you scared me! I thought you were a ghost. Ajussi, are you hurt? (Ajussi - Older man, uncle) I'm in a lot of pain, Ding Dong. Something big happened. Ding Dong, what time will your aunt be back? Eleven or twelve? Why is she coming back so late? - Auntie is back. - Hyeong Kyu. Oh, you're back, Auntie? Hmm, uhh... Omo! (Omo - Oh My) I am Dok Go Jin. Why did you come here? Ajussi is hurt. I let him come in to rest for a bit. How could you let just anyone come in? That's right. "Just anyone" Dok Go Jin was at the door in pain, in a lot of pain. Thankfully Ding Dong brought me in and took good care of me. Your heart? Does it still hurt? Gu Ae Jeong, I'm really in a lot of pain. Ding Dong, thank you for the warm tea. Please leave when you're done drinking. Stay for a while, ajussi. Gu Hyeong Kyu! I play at ajussi's house every day. But it's the first time he's come to my house to play. Don't make him leave, Auntie. Boy... Is this ajussi your friend? Your aunt doesn't seem to know. Tell her we are close, Ding Dong. Tell her because I gave you 100 signed photographs, you became really popular in your class. Because of ajussi, my friends elected me to be the Entertainment Chief during the outing. Good job, Ding Dong. Okay. Then, let your friend play nicely and then leave, hmm? He has to leave before ten. There's not much time left. You have to leave when your friend falls asleep. Well done, Ding Dong! Next time, I'll give you 100 DVDs. Well done! What should I say? Ajussi! Ajussi, why are you always in trouble with my aunt? I made a big mistake. Then, just admit it, so she'll forgive you. Ding Dong. If I was 7 years old, I could easily do that. But I'm already 37. It's not that easy. My father is 38 years old. But every day, he's saying sorry to my aunt. Hey, Ding Dong. I am Dok Go Jin. I am a special man. You know that I am Dok Go Jin, right? So you're not going to admit you did something wrong? I have to admit I was wrong. No matter what, I have to do it. What? The things I did wrong today...? You want me to write an apology in a children's notebook? You little... Ding Dong, you're a genius. Genius. Genius. Is he really hurt? Why is it so quiet? Is he really playing with Hyeong Kyu? Gu... Ae... Jeong... Today, I did something wrong. Gu... Ae... Jeong... I... Hyeong Kyu, it's time to wash up and get ready for bed. Come on. Auntie, I still haven't packed my things for tomorrow's picnic. I'm going to make you some kimbap. Pack by the time I'm done, okay? I did well, right? Nice. When it comes to food, why are you so stingy? I didn't get to eat because I was sick. Why did you give me these? Then don't eat them. Kimbap's ends are delicious. (Kimbap - Dried seaweed rolls with rice) Did you put cucumber in the kimbap? I don't like cucumbers. Instead of cucumber, don't you have burdock? (Burdock - Root vegetable) If you put in three, it will throw the flavors off balance! Hyeong Kyu, have you picked out what you're wearing tomorrow? I want to wear the clothes you bought for me.  It's Spider-Man! What's that, Ding Dong? Where there's a spiderweb, there's Spider-Man? Looks more like a ladybug stuck in a spiderweb! How could you talk to a child like that? Do you know what's fashionable? I'm South Korea's best fashionista, Dok Go Jin. Have you not heard of Fashion Terminator Dok Go Jin? Shut your mouth before I stuff it full of kimbap. Hyeong Kyu, you look awesome! It's okay. I won't wear it. Ding Dong, come here. Fashion is a sense of self-confidence. Straighten out your shoulders. To make the spiderweb look more shapely, tighten your tummy. Whether you look like a ladybug on a spiderweb or Spider-Man on a spiderweb, it all depends on your confidence. Try it out! Spider-Man! Very good! Nice! Nice to meet you. I'm Iron Man. As fellow superheroes, let's sit down and have some kimbap together. Ajussi, when you were little, did you like Iron Man? Yes. When I was young, I wanted to become Iron Man. At that time I thought Iron Man had an artificial heart, so I wanted it to become the world's strongest superhero. I didn't say it to get your pity, really! Who said anything? Spider-Man and Iron Man, eat the kimbap quickly. How do you expect us to eat kimbap that's been cut like this? Spider-Man! Spider-Man! Ajussi, I'm sleepy. Ding Dong, you can't sleep right now. I still haven't found my opportunity. Spider-Man can't sleep yet because he has to save Dok Go Jin. Get up. Drink this, Ding Dong. Come on. Hyeong Kyu, I put your blankets out. Get up. Go to bed. Ding Dong says he's not sleepy. Kids usually don't sleep at all the night before a picnic. I don't know if you were like that when you were little, but in my house, Hyeong Kyu has to sleep at ten o'clock. Insomnia due to excitement before a picnic, is one of life's greatest pleasures. Don't you know that sleepy kids never have fun on picnics? I don't know. I didn't go to picnics. I don't know. Why? You were too sick to go on picnics? Yes. I missed class every day to go to the hospital and didn't get to go on any outings. What about it? Well, that's your past. Tomorrow Hyeong Kyu has a picnic and he needs to go to sleep soon. So stop bothering him. Go home. Gu Ae Jeong. I have never gone on a picnic before. Tomorrow, let's have a picnic. What? Picnic? The picnic that I've never been on, I've decided to go with you. You think I would go on a picnic with you? I couldn't go on a picnic when I was a sick little boy, but I always hoped to. Perhaps a miracle will occur and I can finally go on a picnic? Will heaven let me go? How great that would be, if Gu Ae Jeong's heaven allows me to. Please. No. Dream on. How can you be so cold? Imagine it, a weak and frail boy who wants to go on a picnic, praying by the window in a hospital ward. Then you couldn't bear to reject me like this. Do you think that if you act so shamelessly stubborn, people will agree to your requests? Has no one ever rejected your requests? The only benefit of being sick was that no one would ever reject or criticize me. I would always be forgiven. Gu Ae Jeong. Can't you just forgive me, just this once? I absolutely won't go on a picnic with you. Because between you and me, there will always be rain. So don't even hope for it. Auntie, is it raining outside? No. It's not raining. Can we still go on a picnic? Of course we can, it won't rain. Let's go in to sleep. Get up! Gu Ae Jeong. I'll wait until the rain between us stops. Then there'll be a rainbow. This big. Let's go in. Ah, rain. It should not rain! It's raining. So now we can't talk about going on that picnic, right? Spider-Man! Oh no, it's raining! The picnic is ruined, the picnic is ruined! Is Spider-Man disappointed? Hyeong Kyu, would you like to watch a cartoon DVD with me instead? What are we going to do? Ah, this man. Really. For a while you're sunny, then you're cloudy, and now there's thunder and lightning. What's so great about you? Always acting on your own. What are you doing? What do you want? Sorry. I didn't tell you I was coming. Did I scare you? I'm sorry I hit you. Are you all right? No, I'm fine. It's nothing. I'm sorry. What are we going to do? No, it's all right. Just a small bump. Why are you here without calling? I bought you a present. Present? Yes, it's a souvenir. Wow! What is it? It's a camera. Hyeong Kyu can use this camera to take pictures when he goes on a picnic. I don't know how to thank you. - I'm going to make tea. - Okay. Hyeong Kyu, it's unfortunate you can't go on the picnic. You're already dressed up as Spider-Man. Ajussi! Ajussi, did you like Spider-Man when you were little? When I was little I liked mystery comics more than superhero comics. Like Sherlock Holmes and Lupin. If it's detective comics, shouldn't it be Conan? Oh, you and Conan look exactly the same! Is that so? Then like Conan, I shall make a deduction. That beautiful looking kimbap... your aunt made it, right? Will you give it to me? Oh, it looks like it'd be a great help in solving my case. And... I'll treat you to something better than kimbap. What do you like? Pick out as many as you like and put them in here. Iron Man, I'm sorry. You didn't have to do this. If Spider-Man joins Team Pil Ju, won't the team be even stronger? To get him to like me. Spider-Man, do you like the tent? Come in. Shall I? -=Proper Dok Go Jin=- It's really too much! Why is he always like this? What is it? I wondered if you're ready for a picnic. To comfort Ding Dong who missed his picnic because of rain, I prepared something. Come down. We're already on a picnic. What? You didn't take me? When did I say I would bring you? I am now on a picnic. I'm happy and I like it. Where did you go? Are you playing games with me? No games. I'm not going. I'm in front of your house. In front of my house? You're in your house? I'm coming up. No, you can't. I have a guest. A guest? Is it that oriental medicine doctor? You said that as a patient you were always forgiven no matter how unreasonably you behaved, right? But even if you're sick enough to die, I won't worry. Sorry, I'm hanging up now. It's done. Let's eat. -=Will she appear?=- =Will Miss Gu Ae Jeong appear?= -=Will she appear?=- =Will she accept Mr. Yun Pil Ju's heart?= =Anticipation is high this spring evening.= -=Finally, Miss Gu Ae Jeong appears.=- =Finally, the woman the perfect man has been waiting for has appeared.= -=The nervous two=- =Couple Making Season 3's finalist,= =Miss Gu Ae Jeong.= =Is she walking towards Mr. Yun Pil Ju for a new beginning?= =Or is she coming forward to reject his heart?= Doctor, you looked so nervous! You must've been very excited. Looks like it. I think so too. Very handsome, very photogenic. =Audience, please wait a little longer.= =The Season 3 finale shall begin soon.= -=At last, Gu Ae Jeong's entrance=- -=At last, Gu Ae Jeong's Entrance=- =Miss Gu Ae Jeong has once again started to walk towards Mr. Yun Pil Ju.= =What will her final decision be?= =Okay, Mr. Yun Pil Ju is ready.= =Miss Gu Ae Jeong,= =please make your decision.= You are very beautiful. They are really compatible. -=Confession is successful=- =The beginning of the new couple.= =Miss Gu Ae Jeong and Mr. Yun Pil Ju.= Of course, you are more beautiful than before. =Everybody, please congratulate the new couple.= =Mr. Yun Pil Ju's face lights up with a smile.= =On becoming Couple Making's third couple, our sincere congratulations.= =The atmosphere is filled with love.= =Let us all truly be in love.= =Everybody's Couple Making.= With the subtitles, CG, and background music as well... This is too much for me. Feels like my heart is breaking bit by bit. Se Ri, we hit the highest viewer ratings again! They're only interested because the result was unexpected. Most comments on the official website said they were incompatible or that it was boring. But won't it make more people look forward to the next season? For the time being, we'll just record the both of them. So we can just prepare slowly for the next season. Then what about me? If that's the case, you wouldn't need the MC, would you? You can do the opening and closing, and make a few bridge comments. Help them talk about their feelings and such. Am I some narrator who only makes bridge comments? We're saying that this is only temporary. So we'll focus most of our energy on searching for our next perfect man. I shouldn't have let Ae Jeong eonni join my program. This is pissing me off. But... wasn't it a big hit? What's the use of it being a bit hit? Gu Ae Jeong snatched all my screen time. I have no presence on the show at all. This is exactly the same as when I was in National Treasure Girls ten years ago. Everything was snatched away by Ae Jeong eonni. Mr. Yun Pil Ju is here. I really don't want him to be snatched away from me. Miss Kang Se Ri, can we talk? Did you take to heart what I told you on the program the last time? Did you come to confirm whether that was real? I thought what you said wasn't sincere. If you were sincere, then under those circumstances you wouldn't treat it like a joke. That's what I think. Did you think I was kidding? Then think whatever you like. Ignore it if you want. I cannot ignore it. I don't understand why you, at that critical moment, intentionally said those things to confuse me. Are you criticizing me because at the important moment of your confession to Ae Jeong eonni, I interfered and spoiled it for you? I'm not criticizing you. I just want to know the reason. I hate Ae Jeong eonni. That's why I wanted to screw it up. Happy? Miss Kang Se Ri, you're horrible! Your face is so beautiful, but how can you be so ugly inside? Are you criticizing me? Those who do wrong must be criticized. In the future, don't play such tricks again. I am Kang Se Ri. How embarrassing. He has no insight. Coming over here to scold me. I hid it from the manager and secretly activated the phone oppa bought me. Did you see the heart I drew for you on Music Center last week? That was a gift to oppa from me. I really miss you too. It's still the same as before. Girl group members seeing their boyfriends behind their manager's back. What to do? Oppa is very handsome. What the hell is this? Wait a moment. Ya! What is that? It's chewing gum. Why would a piece of gum be there? Give it to me! Are you okay? What are we going to do? It's my fault. I'm sorry. Are you okay? I'm all right. Is it really funny? It's difficult to wash off, isn't it? We also had times like that. If earlier I'd said I'd help her secretly date Dok Go Jin, then she probably wouldn't have come on the program with Yun Pil Ju, right? How many times must I say it? Didn't I say you can't use your personal cell phone? I'm confiscating this. She got caught. Manager Jang, hello. Go prepare for your next program. My biggest headache about these idols are their love lives. Kids that age are all the same. We were like that too. Kang Se Ri, you were so good back then! It's just that you never caught me. Dating was Han Mi Na's specialty. Mi Na? At that time, she dated one of the most famous male idols. And because of that, I received stuff like razor blades from his fans. You don't remember? I remember that time I cried a lot. Anyway, Gu Ae Jeong was really nosy back then too. She was saying it was the agency's responsibility to protect you girls and even asked us to compromise with the other agency. You don't know how irritated I was because of that. Anyway, if you find Han Mi Na you must definitely tell me. I will rely on you. Did Ae Jeong eonni also help Mi Na date secretly? Well, no surprise, since she loves to meddle. Since it's already been broadcast, I can't just stand by and watch. I have to go in and see how she lives. Why are you here again? Let's go inside and talk. But before that, I have to confirm something with you so that I don't do this in vain. This house is not owned by Gu Ae Jeong, is it? It's a monthly rent. I thought it was on annual rent. She wanted to change it to annual rent, but the price has been going up. Fine, let's go inside. Hello. I'm Ae Jeong's oppa, Gu Ae Hwan. Then this child is...? He's my son, Ae Jeong's nephew. Say your greetings. Hello, I am Gu Hyeong Kyu. Why is this oppa not working and just staying at home? Don't you have a job? Of course, I'm working. I am Ae Jeong's manager. No matter what, you still depend on Ae Jeong, don't you? Why doesn't this oppa live at his own house but rather at his sister's? We live together with Ae Jeong. Live together meaning... she supports her father, oppa, and nephew as well? Since we're a family, of course we live together. How can you say that we all depend on her support? That's right, how is it that she's supporting us? You don't know how much I take care of her as her manager. Gu Ae Jeong and beggars. Aigoo, what to do? (Aigoo - Oh Dear, Oh My God) You are aware that Director Jerry Heimer is coming to the Korean Film Awards, aren't you? Rumor has it that his next movie will contain lots of superheroes. He said for one of the roles, he's going to pick an Asian actor. It seems like he's very impressed with your previous works. They contacted us and said that they want to meet with you. Dok Go hyeong might be going to Hollywood soon. (Hyeong - Older brother) Director Jerry Heimer invited him to star in his movie. Really? So when is he leaving? If everything is okay after the meeting with the director tomorrow, he may go to the United States at any time. But nothing has been decided yet? It's the same as having it all settled already. Dok Go hyeong's dream is to be cast as a superhero. The role is a superhero who protects the Earth. If he's a superhero, that'd be like Batman or Spider-Man, someone like that? He's not a solo hero like them. It's more like the X-Men. He's part of a group of superheroes like them. Does that mean Mr. Dok Go Jin will be like Hugh Jackman from X-Men? If it's a big hit, I guess so? Then he'll really be like Iron Man. Originally, I didn't want to eat the donuts out of consideration for ajussi. Sorry! Ding Dong. Having only lived 7 years, you don't need to put so much care into society's problems just yet. You're just eating a donut. Don't blame yourself for being unable to resist the temptation and subsequent betrayal. Okay... Ajussi, I brought you this. Is this what the oriental medicine doctor gave you? That's right. Having lived 37 years, I've already put in too much care, so I can't eat this. To me, this is a dangerous bait given by the enemy. I'll just eat them then. Yes, eat. Eat a lot and then exercise a lot. If you want to have a perfect body like mine, first, you must be tall. My Ding Dong, when we meet again, you should at least be that tall, right? Ajussi, are you leaving? Hmm... Ajussi is going to become a superhero. This room's a mess! My heart races because I like you. I thought it was an illusion, but I was wrong. Gu Ae Jeong, I'm sorry. Don't mess with me. Just go to Hollywood and protect the Earth. I beg of you. If I leave you here, you'll probably just wither naturally, right? Wow, it's very beautiful. There's no need for changes. We can just get the cameras rolling. I got it! When we reveal Miss Gu Ae Jeong's home, we'll use her friend Jenny's restaurant. And the housewarming date, we'll shoot it at Pil Ju's house. Good. The director we're meeting today, Jerry Heimer, seems quite interested in casting you. China's Jackie Chan wanted to be the lead actor. But he rejected him right away, saying you are his first choice. Wow! They're going on a picnic. Hyeongnim, there's a traffic jam right now. (Hyeongnim - Respected older brother) If we want to be on time, we have to leave quickly. Let's go. Hyeongnim, what's wrong? Is it very painful? Hey, Jae Seok. Let's go to the hospital. Can't you go any faster? Hyeongnim! Hyeongnim, I must tell Representative Moon first. Don't cause any problems. Just say it's a small issue. Let her delay the meeting with the director for a bit. Dok Go. Is it very painful? My heart, it feels as if... as if it's being torn apart, Doctor. Please, think of a way. Let's just do a thorough examination first. Please be prepared. Did you finish washing those? Yes. Your house is very nice. You can come visit even when there's no shooting. If you're uncomfortable, you can bring Spider-Man with you. Spider-Man. You're... broken. The artificial part of your heart is failing. We'll have to do another surgery. So... This situation is the same as the one from ten years ago, right? Correct. If we didn't know your heart was failing, you might have just collapsed. Thanks to the song "Thump Thump," you took extra notice of your heart rate. That's why you were able to realize it before your heart failed completely. I'll make preparations and arrange for your surgery as soon as possible. What is the probability of success? Fifty-fifty. If you don't die, you live. There are the only two outcomes. That's what you said last time too. In the end, after I recovered, you told me that I only had a five percent chance of survival. You kept saying it was a miracle and bragged all the time. Did I say that? Well, all I can say is if you don't die, then you live. There are only two outcomes. So my heart... is really breaking. Isn't that Dok Go Jin? Right? It seems so. It really is, right? Yes, right. - He's really too cool! - That's right. I am Dok Go Jin. Is he really Dok Go Jin? - Dok Go Jin! - So handsome! Wow, Dok Go Jin is really handsome! Mr. Dok Go Jin! You are Mr. Dok Go Jin, right? That's right. I am Dok Go Jin. Oppa, I am your fan. Can you please give me an autograph? Give it to me. Can you please give me an autograph? -Can you please give me an autograph? -Me too. -Please sign. Sorry. I'm very sorry! He has to go now. I'm very sorry. Don't interfere. Give it to me. I'm sorry. There are so many, I can't sign them all. Everybody, please write it down. -Dok -Dok -Go -Go -Jin -Jin Put a heart at the end. You're very skilled in cutting vegetables? I practiced. I want to make potato salad. Do you like it? No, I really don't like potatoes. Really? Then, let's get rid of this. Okay. I'm the most important director in the world, and this movie has the potential to make us so much money. And even though there are a lot of characters, you, you, Dok Go Jin, are by far and away the most important one. Together, you and me, we can bring this movie to the world, and make you an international star. You're the man. So, what do you say? Are you in? Thank you! Thank you so much! That's great! What transpired here, I'll handle with full discretion. Just leave with the director. Am I guaranteed to win Best Actor at the Korean Film Awards? I will leave after I win it. That's right. I want to stay in everyone's memory with my image as the coolest. Our production team put in a lot of effort to get Miss Gu Ae Jeong the opportunity to present an award at the MBS Korean Film Awards. That's right. Even if you treat it as doing it for our program's sake, it's time to change Miss Gu Ae Jeong's image. That's what I told the President in order to get this opportunity. It wasn't easy to come across such an opportunity. An artist can drastically change their image just by wearing the right dress at an awards ceremony. We'll definitely have to prepare with proper dedication. It'll be luxurious and elegant, just like our Representative Moon. I understand. Oh, also. Please use this in the program for indirect advertising. These are Miss Gu Ae Jeong and Mr. Yun Pil Ju's couple cell phones. It definitely has to appear in the program. Please allow her to change her cell phone. Omo, this cell phone is from Dok Go's CF, isn't it? Wow! It's lighter and brighter. Isn't it? Gu Ae Jeong... Did you like taking a peek? Who's peeking? What you're wearing is very nice. I heard you're presenting an award. Don't tell me it's for the Best Male Actor award? It's the Child Actor award. Could it be possible that you'll receive the Child Actor award? When you walk on the red carpet, be careful not to trip on your dress. I'm really worried that because my heels are too high, I'll fall. Walk the red carpet with confidence. Just think of yourself as the most beautiful person in the world. And walk with your head held high. Since I don't look bad today, I will lift my head and be a little bit cocky. Today, I don't look cheap wearing this, right? Even when you wore the frog costume, you were the most luxurious frog I've ever seen. Thank you. Just keep doing your best. Ah, Gu Ae Jeong. Do I look cool today? I have to be the coolest today. You are the only one in South Korea who says I'm not cool. You should also say it. Come on. You're cool. You were cool even when you were Dog Shit Jin. Of course. Remember me as being this cool. Gu Ae Jeong. Ah... I must forget you even if you are cool. -=Korean Film Awards=- Eonni, here is the schedule. Thanks. Today's part... It's the second from last, right? Mmm... But why did you borrow so many dresses and hanboks? I borrowed all the pretty ones so the other actresses can't wear them. Can everybody leave us alone for a moment? What's the matter? My next movie will be shot in Hollywood. In my acceptance speech, I'll mention it. If you showed surprise at not having been told already, it would seem awkward. So I'm telling you beforehand. Hmm, receiving a prestigious award on such a big stage... and mentioning those plans, you certainly will look cool right? Of course. Today is very special. I have to be the coolest. Omo, you are very beautiful! Don't I look too simple? Not at all. You are beautiful. You are really pretty. Really, you think so? Thank you. Even though I am not receiving an award, just presenting one, I still feel very nervous. What award are you presenting? The Child Actor award. I won't be able to face the child who wins the award if I continue to feel so nervous. If you are tense, then do this. It will help. Pressure point, right? Miss Gu Ae Jeong. You are the first one to go stage and present an award. So please wait backstage. Yes. I'll be waiting for you in the audience. Our baby is too cute. Really? Girls, hello. Manager Jang. How are you? Ah, Gu Ae Jeong. You're quite popular lately. And now you have even come to present on this great stage. Was this arranged by the Couple Making team as well? Yes. Girls, keep up the good work. You really have it easy. Because of you, the one I'm managing got eliminated from Couple Making. To say that it was entirely because of me... Manager Jang. Why do you always think everything is my fault? Gu Ae Jeong, Do you think you've become invincible? Gu Ae Jeong, you aren't at the level where, no matter what offenses you commit, you will still be forgiven. Just because you're wearing nice clothes, do you really think your level has increased and you can do whatever you want? Today, I won't bow my head because of your unreasonable claims. Let's go, eonni. Gu Ae Jeong, I'm really sorry! The clean clothes became dirty in an instant, huh? That's why I said such clothes don't suit you. What a shame. Hello, I'm a Film Awards ceremony staff member. Miss Kang Se Ri, there's a problem with an award presenter right now. Can you present the award in her place? I'm here to perform, not to present some award. Please be understanding. It's the first award to be presented, the Child Actor award. Child Actor award? I still need to check my dress. I need to hurry. Where did my stylist go? Miss Kang Se Ri is coming out right now. Wait a moment. Isn't Miss Gu Ae Jeong in charge of the Child Actor award? That was the original plan. Okay, I'll be there immediately. Manager Jang, you did this intentionally, didn't you? No, my hand just slipped. Why are you always making things difficult for Ae Jeong? What's with you? What did I do to Ae Jeong? You went too far. I was just holding the cup and carelessly slipped. On this day, to have this dress stained by this kind of thing... What a waste. You're burned. Yes, but it's not serious. It will be fine after I run it under some cold water for a while. Looks like I'm not meant to wear such grand dresses. I'm more suitable for the frog costume that won't be ruined no matter how much I roll around in it. It's going to leave a scar. Go and put on some medicine, quickly. Korean Film Awards host, Song Yun Ah. I'm telling you, I almost laughed to death. No, no, I'll tell you about it when I get there. Fine, fine, I'll talk to you when I see you. Okay. Manager Jang. Oh, Dok Go Jin? It won't leave a scar, but it will blister and hurt. Eonni, why did you call him? Because of me you couldn't see the ceremony, I'm sorry... I was coming to see you anyway. That Manager Jang, why can't he just leave you alone? It wasn't your fault that the National Treasure Girls separated. Se Ri was partly responsible, and so was Mi Na... Don't say anything. The awards ceremony has ended, right? Yes, right. =At the MBS Film Awards, the Best Male Actor award...= I'm leaving now. Wait a minute. They're talking about Dok Go Jin. =There are rumors that he rejected the award.= There are also rumors saying he did not get along with the director. -=Dok Go Jin unable to attend the awards ceremony=- . =He was expected to win the award for Best Male Actor for his role in Fighter.= =Mr. Dok Go Jin is being swarmed by reporters.= Wait a minute! Mr. Dok Go Jin is not at the agency right now. So everybody please leave. Then... why did he suddenly reject the award? Was there a problem with the movie company regarding his pay? When the movie was released, there were rumors that he didn't get along with the director. Did he leave because of that? I'm very sorry. Right now we cannot answer any questions. I'm very sorry. Yes, Representative. I know. I know. Yes. There are lots of reporters at the agency entrance, right? It's crazy here. Anyway, just tell them that an unavoidable personal matter suddenly came up. I'll have to handle things here before I go. Where's Dok Go? He should be at home, but he won't answer the phone. We must find him. Until the situation calms down, ask him to hide in a quiet place. Before reporters barge into the house. When I press down, let me know if it hurts. Oppa. What's the matter? Jae Seok told me to hurry to Dok Go Jin's house to check on him. During the awards ceremony, it seems Dok Go Jin hit someone. What? Hit someone? Yes. Before the reporters swarm his house, I'm going to try to sneak him out. I don't know if he'll listen to me, though. Oppa, I will go. Why do you have to go? There's something I need to confirm. I'm going. =Security system disarmed.= The password is still 6090. Mr. Dok Go Jin? Exactly what happened? Did you really hit someone? I don't feel like doing an interview with you. I'm very tired. You shouldn't have caused trouble. You have to go to Hollywood and fulfill your dream of becoming a superhero. Saving the Earth? Right? I'm not going. Even without me protecting the Earth, it still spins around fine on its own. The thing I must protect, while looking cool, is right here. I've done too many cool things today. So I'm a bit tired. What are you doing? Don't move. To continue being cool, I need more strength. Recharge.
