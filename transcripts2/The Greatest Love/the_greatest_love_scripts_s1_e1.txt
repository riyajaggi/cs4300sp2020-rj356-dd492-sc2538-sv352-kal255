GU AE-JEONG OF NATIONAL TREASURE GIRLS AT DISCO NIGHTCLUB Are you feeling okay? Maybe it's because of the jajangmyeon I ate earlier. It feels like my stomach is on a roller coaster. Ae-jeong, should we just cancel your schedule for today? No! It's just jajangmyeon, it'll get digested soon. I should go buy some coke. Stay here. You keep forgetting Ae-jeong, but you're a celebrity, too. I'm your brother, but I'm your manager as well. Right, I forgot. Alright then, manager. No, Mr. Gu. Please get me a coke. Something to help my stomach. Okay, my artist. Until the day I die... Hey, Jae-seok. This is the drama I rejected to film Fighter, right? Yes, Kim Jun-seong took the role instead of you. What's the viewer rating for this show? It totally failed. It's not even five percent. "Five percent"? And the reviews were terrible, so Jun-seong is done for. Really? He's done for, I see. I ruined his career because I rejected it. I feel really sorry. Ms. Moon is looking for your next drama. Choose carefully. You should avoid stuff that will ruin your career. Why would I shoot a drama? I have to go to Hollywood and shoot a film with Peter Jason. Well, it's not confirmed yet. What are you talking about? I went all the way to the States myself to audition. So it's confirmed for sure. It's even in the news, isn't that right? Why are you so negative? Wait... Peter didn't turn me down, did he? We'll wait and see. You even sent a 15 thousand dollar wine as a gift. I'm sure he'll favor you. I should call Ms. Moon. Hey, turn that off. Should I get some water for you? What's taking him so long? I need some fresh air. Oh, my back. It's a van. It must be a new model. I wonder if a celebrity is inside? Why isn't she answering her phone? The person you are trying to reach is unavailable. Hey, it's a celebrity! Where? That's the kind of van celebrities use. Wow, she's so pretty. But where did I see her? Right. I may not be popular, but I'm still well-known. I'm so jealous. Where's my manager? I'm so busy, I should be on my way. How ridiculous. My goodness. How dare you lean on this. Stop hanging around and go away. Sorry, I didn't know someone was here. I was just admiring the car. Sorry. You must be a celebrity. Are you a singer? An actor? Hello. Let's say hello. Aren't you a celebrity? Why don't you say hello... Go throw this away. I don't work here... I'll throw that away for you. It spilled all over me! Thank you. Oh, gosh. -Damn it. -My coat... What do I do? This is so annoying. Here. Wipe the car. What? You gave me this to wipe the car? Not for me? You're the one who spilled it all over the car. What? What did you just say to me? Whatever. Never mind. Forget it, just go. I can't believe it! You're so rude! What? You're a celebrity, right? I'm a celebrity, too. You can see me from in there, right? Let me see your face. Don't just stick your arm out. Come out. Come on. Who are you? -Let me see your face. -Go away! Did you just poke me with that? Come on. Who are you? Come out. Where are you? What do you think you're doing? -Go away! -Gosh. Hey! I got you. Let me see who is this rude. Hey. Did you just grab my hand? Let go of me! I'm not leaving until I see your face. Let go of me. You're twisting my arm! You're hurting me. What are you doing? Let me go. What are you writing? Excuse me! Let go. What are you doing? Let go of me. That hurt. What a crazy man! What is this? That's my autograph. You want to know who I am? Try and guess. Hey. Come out. Excuse me. You're not fooling around, right? Open the door. Let me talk to you. Open the door. Hey! What a weird person. You stay right there. I'm not letting you leave. Hey! Hey! What are you doing in there? -Come on out! -Jin! Are you seriously going to stay in there like this? -Get in, hurry. -What? -Hey! -Lock the door. -Come on! -Lock the door, hurry. Okay. Excuse me. Who is that woman? I don't know. She says she's a celebrity, too. Just go. Are you running away? Hey! Are you mad? Oh, my gosh. Hey! Stop right there! Where are you going? Ae-jeong, what's wrong? I should've seen who that jerk was. Hey, do you know whose autograph this is? Is that English or Korean? Signing an autograph like this means he's really a celebrity, right? Who in the world could this jerk be? You're so pretty. Kang Se-ri’s airport outfit is out. Change the displayed product right away. It's finally out. It's so pretty. Make a thousand products with this design. KANG SE-RI'S AIRPORT OUTFIT Your airport outfit is listed at the top most searched on the internet. There's another article saying you and Dokgo Jin broke up. That's because I didn't go to his movie premiere. His agency is going to make a complaint about this. I didn't miss it because I wanted to. It was because my flight was delayed. WHY WASN'T KANG SE-RI AT DOKGO JIN'S PREMIERE? Jae-seok! Sorry, please let them have their meal in peace. I'm sorry. I think they took enough pictures. You can stop now. I missed your premiere, so we should at least get photos taken of us having a meal together to show we're still a couple. Thanks for all your hard work. We don't have to do this much longer. I wouldn't mind leaving our relationship the way it is while you're in Hollywood. The steak is bad, isn't it? The cook missed the right timing and kept it on the fire, ruining the meat. So as we agreed beforehand, we're going to break up naturally, after I leave for the States. Get the facts straight. We broke up a year ago, and we're just revealing that now. Hey, it's Kang Se-ri. The celebrity Kang Se-ri. Don't you know her? I don't know much about celebrities. Where are you? I told you not to go to the bathroom since I won't take long! She's really pretty. What are you looking at? Her pelvis. Her butt? Women who wear high heels like that have a high risk of having an uneven figure due to unstable the center of balance and distortion of the feet. That's what happened to her pelvis. So you're saying she has an uneven butt? You should be careful, too. High heels are dangerous. I saw you coming in, and it seemed like you have a more imbalanced pelvis than her. We're on a blind date, and you're criticizing me for having an uneven butt right now? No. If your symptoms get worse, it could lead to lordosis, -and your back would ache-- -Mr. Yun Pil-joo! You're an oriental medicine doctor, right? Stop giving medical treatment and let's continue our date. Thank you, my artist. It's Dokgo Jin. Grandpa, it's Dokgo Jin. -Tasty milk, GT. -This tastes delicious. He's doing that commercial again. His father must be really proud. Grandpa, my aunt is a celebrity, too. Why doesn't she do commercials like that? It's not because she doesn't want to. She just can't because she has a bad reputation. What does that mean? It means she's not favored among the public. What does "favored" mean, then? Looking nice like that, and doing lots of commercials to earn lots of money. I see. -We're here. -We're here. -You're back. -Hello. Did you have fun today? Auntie, why can't you do commercials like that because of your bad reputation? Hey! Gosh. Hyeong-gyu, I told you not to sit so close to the TV. Go sit over there. I told you to watch from far away. Your eyes are going to get bad. Sit back here. Sit over there. Our huge TV doesn't suit our small house. You're right. Right. Why is there such a huge TV in this small house? That's right. You started a DVD room business but failed and this is all that was left. You should've brought a smaller TV instead of this one. It makes our house look even smaller. The treadmill and the exercise bike take up the most room. You shouldn't have brought them here after your gym went out of business. Before that, I shouldn't have helped you open them in the first place. DAILY MEAL FIGHTER RECEIVES A BAD REVIEW FROM CRITICS DOKGO JIN'S MOVIE FIGHTER WAS OVERRATED FIGHTER WAS A DISAPPOINTMENT -It was really boring. -It's a boring movie. -It was so boring. -So lame. When will Dokgo Jin do real acting? It was fun watching his face, -but it made me yawn. -It's a waste of money. Forget about going to Hollywood. -Why did Dokgo Jin... -It's so boring. -Make some more effort. -It was so boring. DOKGO JIN Okay, Peter Jason. I'm relying on you now. Eating jajangmyeon on a roller coaster! FAIL I could've eaten all that if it hadn't gotten all mushy. Right, that was way too much for one person. Hello, Candies are here. You know Candies, right? Hi, girls. Why don't you say hi? We're acquaintances. -Do you know her? -Who is she? Greeting your seniors will get them to like you, and it will help your career, too. We met several times, didn't we? Come on, say hi to her. -Hello. -Hello. -Hi. -Okay, let's go. Come on. Are you trying to discipline them since you're their senior? You were the same at that age. Mr. Jang still looks at you with hatred. It's because he thinks I'm the reason our group broke apart. Well then, let me tell you your schedule for today, my artist. You have a radio show this afternoon. That's it. That's simple. Then let's go do my one and only schedule with perfection. Hey, this is the scarf you got with Jenny's help, right? Wow, a designer brand item really makes you look more elegant. Radio shows these days also record you on camera, so you have to wear designer items. I have return this later so I have to be careful not to get it dirty. -How much does it cost? -It's really expensive. Wow, the texture is so amazing. Are you okay? -Gosh. -It's Dokgo Jin! I enjoyed your movie, Fighter. I mean, I saw the trailer. -I'll make sure to watch it. -All right. Can I shake your hand? His scarf! Hey, Ae-jeong. He's wearing the same scarf as yours. What? Awesome. -He's so cool. -He's so cool. Put that over there. Hey. Is this something anyone can wear? It's a limited edition. "Limited edition"? It seems like anyone can wear it. My makeup is nice, and I brushed my teeth. Something is missing... My scarf! This is terrible. What do I do? I'm in huge trouble. What do I do? Gosh. What should I do? You should have been careful while in the bathroom. What if they tell me to buy this? A celebrity was wearing it to promote it on a show. They'll let it slide, it's not that serious. I'm not some top celebrity! They'll only let something like this slide if it's a popular celebrity. Ae-jeong. If it's a top celebrity who made the mistake, they'll let it slide, right? A top celebrity like Dokgo Jin? VIP DRESSING ROOM No, again. Go, I'll keep watch. It's really the same scarf. Hide this... You're a top celebrity, so you'll be forgiven for everything, right? You're the top celebrity, Dokgo Jin. Good luck. Mr. Dokgo! Wait a minute! Mr. Dokgo! Mr. Dokgo! Wait, I... I'm a fan of yours. Can I get an autograph? He needs to get ready, maybe next time. No, wait. Just one autograph, please? -Jae-seok. -Yes? -You said you wanted an autograph. -Oh, yes. Where should I sign? Well, it's... I... Here. -What do I do? -Where? Happy? -Can I take a photo, too? -Sorry. -Sorry. -Mr. Dokgo! Please, just one photo. Mr. Dokgo! Mr. Dokgo, just one photo... You can get one if you come back later. All right, why don't you go now? -Bye. You can get another autograph later. -Okay. Sorry. Bye. There are so many weird people. Why don't you talk about the time you ruptured your eardrum while practicing for the action scene in the movie? I told you I don't want to mention that. Getting hurt during a shoot isn't something to brag about. Why? People will think you really did your best and like you more. I can act nice, but I don't want to act like I'm hurt. That's not acting, you really got injured. Never mind. Why aren't there any questions about that film with Peter Jason? It used to be in the list of questions. Well... Rumors already spread about me going to Hollywood. Isn't that what people would be the most curious about? It's not something you necessarily need to talk about. What? Did you tell them to take out that question? -Can't we talk about that after-- -Why? I don't think you're going to film that movie with Peter Jason. Do you think that or do you know it for sure? -Kim Jae-seok. -Yes, sir. Did I really get rejected? Did I get rejected by Peter Jason? I thought it was almost confirmed. What happened? I even sent him that expensive wine. He drank all that and just rejected me? -Why did he do that? -Wine? So he even sent a bribe. I guess he thought the language barrier would be a problem. -So a different Asian actor was chosen. -Who? The actor Wang Ryun, from China. His native tongue is English. So it's because he's bad at English. So you mean I was pushed aside by Wang Ryun and rejected by Peter because I'm not good at English? Ms. Moon and I decided we would delay mentioning this -to the press for a while. -Get out. -Are you okay? -I'm not okay, so get out. Do you want me to ditch the recording? All right, I'm leaving. You should calm down before you begin. Damn it. Dokgo Jin showed off about going to Hollywood. Look at him now! He lost his role because he's bad at English. -He should've studied more. -It was a delusion from the start. He lost his role to Wang Ryun. He's a disgrace to our country. Why don't you study a bit? There were so many articles saying he was going to Hollywood. But it seems he failed. I guess he isn't forgiven for everything just because he's a top celebrity. Oh, my gosh. Who are you? Hello, Mr. Dokgo. Who are you? I was just passing by, and I saw a sign on the door saying it was your dressing room. I'm a fan of yours. I'm a fan, and my nephew is a fan, too. So I wanted to get an autograph... But you don't seem to be in a good mood, so I'll just ask for one later. -Sorry about this. -Hold on. Where should I sign? Here? That's... Are you crazy? Don't! Goodness! My knee. Do you know how expensive this is? How could you do this on this scarf? What's wrong with you? You said you wanted an autograph. What's with you? When did I ask you to sign it here? Do you know how much this costs? How could you do something like that on such an expensive scarf? What kind of autograph is this, anyway? It's just a stupid triangle! And this is a permanent pen! I won't even be able to wash it off. Can I shake your hand? You're the "anyone" that I saw earlier. What did you say? It's the same one, right? Take this and leave. I don't want to wear something anyone can wear around anyway. So just take that. But if you just switch this with mine-- It's fine. Just go. What? Stop hanging around and go away. How dare you lean on this. Stop hanging around and go away. All right. Go and throw this away, too. Go throw this away. Kim Jae-seok! Kim Jae-seok! Kim Jae-seok! Jae-seok! What else do you want? This is your autograph, right? -So what? -Then, this too? That's my autograph. You want to know who I am? Try and guess. I got you. So it was you, Dokgo Jin. I found you easily enough since we're working in the same field. What are you going to do? I've caught you. So what are you going to do about it? Are you going to post something online or what? If you're scared of things like that, you should apologize first. So you like stuff like that. Then listen to my apology. I was rude to you that day. I'm... really sorry. That was a really proper apology. Is that enough for an apology? Well, I have nothing to say since you apologized like that. Also, that was a mistake I made, misunderstanding your request. You'll forgive me, right? This? Sure, I will. Then I get that you're forgiving me. Yes. So I'll take back my scarf. You're taking this back? It's mine. Let go. Let go. -Let go of this. -No. Let go. If you don't let go, it's going to get risky. Fine, don't let go then. This is actually something I really like. Well, then. I have a recording to go to, so bye. Hey... What? What happened? What's up with him? Jae-seok! There are many text messages already. Let's begin with a story from Park Mi-jin. Alright, I'll read the story. My husband prepared a present for our first wedding anniversary. It was a 55-inch TV for our living room. Who is this present really for? We had a huge fight and I cut all the TV cords. Men are always like this. We'd be satisfied with something small and shiny, right? They really have no clue about women. We'll be back after listening to a song. It's a request from Jung Soo-kyung. "Chococat" by Ibadi. When the song ends, the DJ and guest will have a talk session. -You can rest during the song. -Okay. -Go. -Gu Ae-jeong. I watched you as the song was playing. That autograph on your scarf, isn't it Dokgo Jin's? How did you know? I'm a huge fan of Dokgo Jin. -Are you a fan too? -No, I don't really... I mean, a friend of mine is a fan, and she asked me for his autograph. I was on my way to the studio and I ran into him, so I got his autograph. Dokgo Jin, thank you so much. I guess you two are pretty close, then. We're just colleagues, you know. What did he seem like in person? He's not really the same as what people know him to be like. What you see of him in the media isn't really what he's like. Really? What is he really like, then? Honestly, the Dokgo Jin I saw in person is someone really rude, who talks roughly to people. He bosses everyone around, and he has no manners at all. He just does anything he wants to. So to put it simply, he's a total asshole. What? "Asshole"? -How dare she say that? -How could she say that to a colleague? SHE IS SO ANNOYING GO TO HELL What is that? What is this? -How can she say that? -Who is she to say that? -What's wrong with her? -How ridiculous. -What's wrong with her? -I can't believe it. What's up with her? -Who is she to say that? -What's wrong with her? -Unbelievable. -What did you just say? -That was so harsh. -She's so annoying. Just leave this planet. Gosh. -Get lost! -Get lost. What is Gu Ae-jeong saying about Dokgo Jin? So what is Dokgo Jin really like? What did you mean, exactly? The truth is, Dokgo Jin ruptured his eardrum while filming his recent work. The movie Fighter, that's releasing soon. He got injured while learning martial arts for the film. Despite that, he kept shooting. But if news about his injury got out, fans could get worried about him, so he asked his manager not to tell anyone about what happened. So you see, he's really not an honest person. DOKGO JIN EARDRUM RUPTURE DOKGO JIN SCARF AUTOGRAPH GU AE-JEONG This is amazing! How long has it been since you were one of the top searches? The responses are that good? Of course, Dokgo Jin's fans are totally praising you. Really? Ae-jeong. Guess who I listened to that radio show with? Who? Producer Jang of Quiz to Change the World! We were listening to it while eating in the cafeteria. So? You're going to be on that show tomorrow! -What? Really? -Yes! One of the guests couldn't come tomorrow, so I mentioned you, -and he asked for you right away! -Are you serious? I thought I was having a really bad day, but I'm getting so lucky! Right? You know how guests call other celebrities during the show? I said you could call Dokgo Jin. What? You know, they call their friends and do a quiz. I said you could call Dokgo Jin, so the producer said you could come. Ae-hwan... For season one, a sharp-looking lawyer who is 180cm tall and earns 300 million won a year. And for season two, a handsome fund manager who's 185cm and earns 400 million won a year. And the man for season three can't seem any lacking compared to the former guys. I know, but where do we find a guy like that? We have to find one no matter what. Everything from looks, height, education, career, family background, and wealth. COUPLE MAKING We have to find the perfect man who is superior to the men from the previous seasons in every aspect. -Hello. -Hello. Hello. Dr. Yun, your mother is waiting for you. -Hi. -Pil-joo. Where were you? What's this? You were at the medicinal herb market again? Mr. Kim got these ox bezoars. With this size, it would've cost over 100 million won. He specifically asked for you to make them into pills. But doesn't Mr. Kim go to my uncle's hospital? I got him to give them to you. You must be busy lobbying people while playing golf and attending gatherings. If you know how hard I'm working, stop hanging around the market and meeting ginseng diggers at Jiri Mountain. You promised you won't meddle in my work if I went to all those blind dates. But there are no results. I heard you told the last girl that you're closing down the hospital to go study in China. I'll look for a great doctor who can run the hospital just as you want it. And you're going to go to China? You can't go. Never! It's not that I can't go. I'm just not going. I'm not letting anyone say that I got rejected by Peter. We have to say that I rejected him because I wanted to do another piece. First, we have to have something confirmed to work on instead of Peter's movie. Jae-seok. Find a decent program to do within this month. Why don't you just say it's because of your injury? -Since people know about your eardrum. -What? -How do they know that? -Weren't you the one who said it? There were posts all over the internet after Gu Ae-jeong mentioned it. -Who's Gu Ae-jeong? -It says here that you two are close friends who show your real selves. I don't have friends like that. Who's Gu Ae-jeong? GU AE-JEONG That's Gu Ae-jeong. -This is Gu Ae-jeong? -So you do know her. Well, I do, but she has absolutely nothing to do with me. -Who is she? -Don't you know National Treasure Girls? It was a girl group. Se-ri was a member, too. She did something like that? You've been a couple for over a year, but you hardly know anything about her. Anyway, what is this "National Treasure Girls"? Everyone was crazy about the World Cup in 2002. But in 2001, everyone was crazy about the National Treasure Girls. NATIONAL TREASURE GIRLS, NATIONAL POPULARITY Jenny, Ae-jeong, Se-ri, Mi-na. All four members were popular, but Gu Ae-jeong was the most popular. And the youngest member was Kang Se-ri. But... NATIONAL TREASURE GIRLS' SUDDEN DISBANDING After about a year and a half, -Our disbanding... -they suddenly disbanded at their peak. -We're very sorry. -There were all kinds of rumors about them fighting or getting pregnant. They were chaotic. After that, Gu Ae-jeong released a solo album but it was a total failure. GU AE-JEONG'S LOVE TRIANGLE SCANDAL Then there was a huge scandal about her and someone who had a fiancée. And then a drunk assault scandal. -Give us a comment. -I have nothing to say. -Gu Ae-jeong! -Gu Ae-jeong! There was lots of gossip saying she was a mistress of a Yakuza, or that she had a sponsor's baby, all kinds of stuff like that. Now she's just a celebrity with a bad reputation. She's a nobody in this field. GU AE-JEONG'S GOSSIP RUINS HER REPUTATION A Yakuza sponsor? I don't even think she could have one. Anyway, I see she's hit rock bottom now. What's going on between you and her anyway? There's nothing going on. Then why did you tell her you ruptured your eardrum during the shooting? Why would I ever tell her that? She really is strange. She was hanging around my van and dressing room. I thought she seemed suspicious. Then did she overhear our conversation in front of the dressing room? Maybe. What if she also heard about Peter Jason? No way. Jae-seok. Find out her phone number. PLUTO Don't worry. I'll sell this at an auction site if I have to. Dokgo Jin has a lot of fans. Someone will be willing to buy this. Really? I'd be really thankful. But what are you going to do? If you can't call Dokgo Jin on the show, the producer will think you were lying and dislike you. I know. What do I do? Don't you even have his number? If I do, I'd have called him already. Hello? Who is this? Who? Dokgo Jin? What? Are you really Dokgo Jin? Why is there food here? I'm buying, so help yourself. I have a favor to ask, so... -What? -Well... Why don't we talk when we brighten up after eating... Eating that won't brighten up anything, so just say it now. It's a bit weird to be asking you this, but... Do you know the speed quiz in the program Quiz to Change the World? Do you mean that variety show? Yes. I'm going to be in that show. And for that speed quiz, we call celebrities we're close to and get them to answer a quiz. -Could you-- -No. I know what you're asking for, and I don't even want to hear it. Can't you just do it? -No. -Just once, please. It's just a phone call, only your voice will be recorded. I'm Dokgo Jin. You're not at the level to ask me stuff like that. Are you an idiot? Why are you so shameless? Try to understand that I'm so desperate I have to be shameless. You sent Peter Jason that expensive wine because you wanted to be in his movie, so you'll know how I feel. How do you know that? Gu Ae-jeong. You heard what my manager and I said in the dressing room, right? You heard it and talked about it on the radio, right? -How much did you hear? -I heard everything. But I really didn't mean to-- Never mind! Stop! Listen to me carefully. If you ever say anything about Peter Jason to anyone else, I'm going to sue you. Got that? I won't. How could I tell people you got pushed aside by Wang Ryun and that you even gave Peter Jason expensive wine as a bribe, but you still got rejected anyway? I would never say that. Okay. But no matter how hard you try to cover that up, people will find out eventually, and it will just get exaggerated, making you a laughingstock. It's better to just reveal it right away and get it over with. Are you trying to give me advice since you're working in the same field? Then let me ask you one thing. Gu Ae-jeong, are you really a mistress of a Yakuza? Did you have a sponsor's baby? Why aren't you saying anything? It's better to tell the truth right away. Or else things will get exaggerated and you'll just become a laughingstock. I forgot you're already a laughingstock. You're right! I am a Yakuza's mistress. You know what the Yakuza is, right? There's a huge dragon on my honey's back. So you better watch yourself in front of me. If you act like such a jerk again, the next time... Be careful. Do you get what I'm saying? Mr. Asshole? Pay the bill, Mr. Asshole. NATIONAL TREASURE GIRLS So that vulgar woman was really a singer. "HEARTBEAT" FANS SAY THEY DON'T BELIEVE GU AE-JEONG'S EXPLANATION Gu Ae-jeong, are you really a mistress of a Yakuza? What's up with this? What's wrong with me? QUIZ TO CHANGE THE WORLD Fifteen minutes before recording. Start the final check. Number one, okay. Number two has a bit of buzzing. Check it. Number three, okay. Gu Ae-jeong. Please give us Dokgo Jin's number to call later. Dokgo Jin's number? You said you were doing the speed quiz with Dokgo Jin, right? Well... Is it okay if I call someone else instead of Dokgo Jin? I'll call Jenny, she was the leader of National Treasure Girls. She's really good at quizzes. This isn't a quiz show, it's a variety show. Why? Did Dokgo Jin say he won't do it? You know, his film is releasing soon. I think he's really busy going around promoting the film. He wants to promote his film on the show? All right. After the quiz, you can mention the film. And give us the phone number. Well... QUIZ TO CHANGE THE WORLD MR. ASSHOLE What should I do? I'm in huge trouble. None of them are appealing. That one seems okay, try reading it. If I go meet Peter Jason again and beg... No. I would never do such a shameless thing. I guess you really were desperate to film Peter's movie. Forget it, I wasn't that desperate. GU AE-JEONG Goodness, she really is shameless. What is it? Dokgo Jin, I'm at the broadcast station right now. We're going to begin the speed quiz soon, and you're going to get a call from the studio by a number that starts with 789. So, if I don't answer that call, you're going to tell everyone about what you heard about Peter? Did you call to blackmail me? I'm not going to mention that. I was just thinking that you might empathize with me and understand how I'm feeling right now. I just called to beg you for this favor one last time with desperation. Okay, fine. Since you called, I'll listen to how desperate you are. Try begging me. Okay, begin. If you reject my request about you answering that phone call, I'd feel the same as when you got rejected by Peter Jason for your role. I hope you understood my feeling of desperation. Bye. Why? Who was it? -It's nothing. -Okay. Gu Ae-jeong! We're recording now, hurry up. All right, I'm going. Yes, I found her. Sorry. We're going inside. Sorry. Hurry up!

CEO MOON JIN-YEONG -There's no special ringback tone. -You're right. -There isn't much time left. -A world star... If he doesn't pick up soon, Gu Ae-jeong will fail -the speed quiz. -Is she going to fail? I guess he's not going to pick up. Hello? He picked up! -He answered. Hurry, the quiz! -Ask him.

Mr. Dokgo, congratulations. It's the first time anyone guessed all ten words. -Oh, really? -Yes. Am I really the first one? But Jin, what was that about your bribe?

People must recognize you and curse you out on the streets! Tell me how much you're worth first. I'm worth ten billion won, can you afford that? I’m going to round everyone up. I'm going to tell them everything. Doctor, do you have a girlfriend? I guess it worked. Don’t let it hurt your pride and try your best. You still look happy when you have a terrible reputation and are getting cursed at by everyone. I'm going to do Peter's film? You’re like a ghost haunting me. Go away.
