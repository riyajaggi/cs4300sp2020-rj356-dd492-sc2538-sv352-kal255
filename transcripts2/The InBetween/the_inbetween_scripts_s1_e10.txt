 - And that drove you to kill? It was very similar  to Ed Roven's work. - Roven's a ghost. When he talks to people,  they can't hear him. - It might be about time we bust you out of here. - He told me to take your eyes. - [gasps]  - [grunts] - I went home. Baby Crystal was in the bath. And I just pushed. - I think she blames me for what happened. - Oh, my mom's necklace. She never took this off. - Brian has what's called a meningioma.

My most recent will... and, uh, my advanced directive, which explicitly lays out all of my wishes should the worst happen. - Babe, we've been over this. You're going to be fine. - We ran through all  the worst-case scenarios, which aren't going to happen--  knock wood. [knocks on table]  We each have a copy of the prime directive-- - Advanced directive.  - Which we won't need. - The surgery is tomorrow.  - Look, we're all nervous. But you're going  to a great hospital, and you've got one  of the best brain surgeons in the world flying in. - There is a snowstorm coming. I hope that doesn't delay  her flight. Knock on wood.  [knocks on table] - Are you gonna be all right waiting at the hospital during the procedure? I know how upsetting that energy is for you. - I've been going over  every day-- walking around, kind of  inoculating myself to it. By the time you go in, I should be able  to block most of it out. I did want to wear  my lucky sweater, though. They gray one.  Is that here? - Washed, folded, and ready to work its magic on my behalf. It's in the dresser in your room. - Thank you.

He couldn't have killed anyone. - Yeah, that's the guy I saw. [cell phone vibrating] - Is that work? [suspenseful music] - A woman's been murdered. Her throat was cut. ♪ ♪ [indistinct chatter] [sighs] What have we got? - Well, the victim's name  is Suzy Lim, 32. A schoolteacher. - Looks like he caught her by surprise. No defensive wounds on her hands, just a clean, straight cut from left to right on the neck. - Robbery? - Television, computer,  cell phone-- they were all left out  in the open. No jewelry was missing,  but her wallet was gone. - Who found her? - Neighbor called 911 when she saw  an unidentified male exiting through the victim's  kitchen door in a big hurry. - Did she get a description? - Caucasian, bearded,  about 6 feet tall-- blue pants  and a yellow parka. - Just got a call  from Suzy Lim's credit union. Her ATM card was used  at a cash machine just about two blocks  from here. - Did you send unis over?  - Yeah. The guy's gone, but the owner's  pulling up the security tape. ♪ ♪ - I know this guy. His name is Calvin Hayes.  We need to bring him in. Alert all precincts  in the city. - On it. - How do you know Hayes? - He's the man that attacked Cassie in front of Council last month. She had a dream about him last night. - [low growl]  - [scoffs] I don't have time  for you, Ed. - Won't be a minute. Just wanted to say a proper good-bye is all. - Are you finally  going somewhere? - Oh, no. Not me. But give my best to you and yours. [dark music] ♪ ♪ - If Hayes was arrested for aggravated assault, what's he doing out of jail already? - He was released O.R.  due to overcrowding. - Oh, you're kidding me. - We've got every unit  in the city on the street looking for him. We will get him back  in custody. - Well, I doubt that's gonna bring much comfort to Suzy Lim's family. ♪ ♪ - Maria. You're checking into Suzy Lim's  friends and family, yes? - Yeah. - See if she has any connection  to anyone at county jail, and if so, find out if she  has ever crossed paths with Mark Waterman. - On it. - Unis picked up Hayes  at a homeless camp on Burnage. They're bringing him in now. ♪ ♪ - Hey. How's the crowd been so far?  - Good. But we're running out of the cinnamon-infused bourbon, so don't push the spicy Manhattans. - Well, we need to unload some  of that vanilla gin anyways. - Ugh. Good luck with that.  I'm out of here. Bye. [sniffs] [sinister music] ♪ ♪ [bones crack]  [gasps] ♪ ♪ - Hey, there, Cottontail. ♪ ♪ [indistinct chatter] [mellow music playing  over speakers] - I don't know why you brought me in here. I was just minding my own business. - Minding your own business? As in attacking young women  with sharp objects. - [scoffs] You got the wrong guy. - You recognize her? You had her ATM card. - I found it. - Your fingerprints were on  her kitchen door, Calvin. When unis picked you up, you  had her blood on your clothes. - We know you killed her. What we want to know is why. ♪ ♪ [indistinct voices] - I'm just an instrument of the Witch Hunter. Change is brought to the Earth through me, but I'm not worthy enough to know why. [tense music] - Who's the Witch Hunter?  - It's not a person. He's like a... [softly] Spirit guide. - How does this spirit guide  communicate with you? - He talks to me... [laughs] Tells me what I need to know, which road to take. - What did he tell you  about Suzy Lim? - He said she was sticking her nose where it didn't belong. Said she was a snitch. Said she had to die. - [breathes deeply] ♪ ♪ Snitching about what?  - He didn't say. - Last month you were arrested for attacking  another young woman. - Uh-huh. He told me she was hurting people with her eyes. They needed plucked.  [laughs] Bitch hit me  with the pepper spray before I got a chance,  but next time-- - There's no next time, Calvin.

County says Waterman is still safely locked in his cell, but they'll double up security. - Then I don't know  why I keep seeing him. - I think I do. When's the last time you spoke with Ed Roven? - Today. He's still pissed we found  Millie Pierce's body. - Yeah, I don't want to humanize a vicious killer, but Roven was sentimental about Millie. - Yeah. - He wanted to keep her for himself. - Did he threaten you?  - Well, not in so many words. Why? - Calvin Hayes-- the homeless guy that attacked you last month-- he murdered a woman this morning. He cut her throat. - You think Roven told him  to do it? - I don't know. I'm still  putting the pieces together. But listen--I think that Hayes  can hear Roven... and I think Waterman  can hear Roven. Think about it. If someone is just  a little bit perceptive and Roven is persistent, couldn't he start to sound  like a voice in your head? - And if you already have violent tendencies, maybe he can get you to kill. - So you think  that Roven and Waterman... they're planning  something now? - I'm not sure yet. But the woman that you just saw  Waterman murder at the bar, can you describe her  to our sketch artist? Maybe the FBI can identify her.  - Yeah, I can do that. But I need something  from you. There's an FBI file  on Roven, right? - Yeah, field office sent it over during the Waterman case. - Can I take a look at it? - Why? - Because I need to know  everything about Roven... the stuff  you can't find online, that dark stuff. - To what end? - There are places far worse  than the inbetween. It's time that Ed Roven  went there, and I think that that... that could solve  all our problems. - If it's all right with  Asante, it's all right with me. - I'll grab the drive. - And listen, you, I am putting a car  on your house until this is all over. You understand?  - Yeah. Totally okay with that. - And if you need anything else, you let me know, okay? - Thanks.  - Please. - Why don't I walk you upstairs  to Forensics, make sure they send the sketch  to the FBI? - Great, thanks. - Hey, Tom.  - Yeah? - All right, I found Suzy Lim's connection to county. It's her. She volunteers at the jail once a month-- tutors prisoners. See that name? - Mark Waterman  was one of her students. [indistinct chatter] - Brian? What are you doing here? [ominous music] ♪ ♪ - Forensics sent this down for you. Said they emailed Asante's friend at the Bureau, too. - Thank you. ♪ ♪ - Tom, I just hung up  with the warden at county. He said that you requested they  put Mark Waterman in solitary. - That's right. We think he may be connected to Suzy Lim's murder. - Yeah, the warden  thinks so, too. He just learned  that Suzy Lim requested a meeting with him  this morning. She told his assistant  it was about Mark Waterman. - Did she say anything else? - Just that it was  an urgent matter. An hour later,  she was murdered. Waterman is in solitary now, and they're gonna search  his cell. If he was planning something,  they'll put a stop to it quick. Good work. ♪ ♪ [indistinct chatter] - Hey. - Hey. Y-you didn't tell Tom you were meeting me? - I told him I was coming here  to grab dinner. What's going on?  - I have a problem. Uh... right now you're the only person I can talk to. The day that Sally passed away... remember I said I had seen her? I saw the two of you together. - I remember.  Sure. - That wasn't the first time I had seen her. Earlier, I saw her fetch. It's like a premonition. You see a person's spirit, but they're still alive, but usually it means they're gonna die. I just saw Brian. [somber music] I don't know what to do. Should I tell him? Should I tell Tom? - You said it "usually"  means death. - Nothing's ever a certainty, I guess. - So what if Brian  postponed his procedure? - I'm not sure that would take care of it. Or worse, maybe making that change is what brings about the bad outcome. - [sighs] - Do you wish I had told you about Sally? ♪ ♪ Would it have changed anything? ♪ ♪ - No, it wouldn't. ♪ ♪ - So you're saying I should-- I should just leave it. - If telling them  won't solve the problem-- you know, if we can't know which decision's  the right one... ♪ ♪ I guess that's  what I'm saying, yeah. Hey. I'm so sorry  you're dealing with this. - Thanks. [cell phone vibrating] ♪ ♪ You got to go. I'll be okay. - All right.  I'll call you later. ♪ ♪ What happened? - Waterman was in solitary when he began showing symptoms of a heart attack. - [sighs]  He's got to be faking it. - His blood pressure was off the charts. They're rushing him  to the nearest facility with a cardiac unit-- Woodgate Memorial.  - [sighs] That's where Waterman worked as an EMT. He knows that place inside and out. - That was the plan all along. He's gonna try and escape  from that hospital. [indistinct chatter] - What happened?  - We got your call. We came up  to check on the prisoner. He'd already made his move. - Looks like he lured the guard  into his room, disabled him, and then escaped  down a back staircase. - Establish  a five-block perimeter. Start a house-to-house search. He could not have gotten far  without someone spotting him. - Yes, sir. - [sighs] We put out a BOLO  and alerted the news stations. They're blasting Waterman's  picture all over town. - I'm looking over the footage for the last hour. That stairway he went down leads to the basement. Connects the entire complex. There are eight exits he could have used without tripping an alarm. Hold on. What's that right there? That's him. He's had someone pick him up. It's a woman. - No plates.  - Run the make and model. - Yeah, just send it  to my phone. And thanks, man.  I owe you. That sketch Cassie did of the woman she saw  with Waterman-- my buddy from the FBI  just ID'd her. - Who is she? - Her name's Deborah Strong--  552 Bloomfield Road, and she drives  a white four-door, just like the one  that picked up Waterman. - She's Waterman's accomplice. - But when Cassie saw  Deborah being murdered, she was actually alive and well  helping Waterman escape. - Cassie wasn't seeing the past. She was seeing the future. - So maybe we're not too late. [ominous music] ♪ ♪ - [sighs] [knocking on door] - Cassie!  - Hannah. I hope it's all right I came by without calling. - Of course. Come in. Come by anytime.  You're always welcome. - How have you been? - I've been okay, thanks. Some bad days, but mostly good. I still miss Abigail so much. But I talk to her now, and that seems to make things easier. - Mm. - Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night, and I hear Crystal laughing in her room, talking to someone, playing peekaboo. I like to think it's Abigail... come for a visit. - Babies  can often see spirits. They just--they usually  grow out of it. - [sighs] I hope she can always see her sister... or at least feel her near. - The truth is, Hannah,  I'm looking for Abigail. It's important,  and I was hoping that she would be here  with you. If you think  that she visits the baby, would it be okay if maybe  I sat in Crystal's room... for a minute? - Of course. It's just up the stairs. - Thank you. [distant sirens wailing] [indistinct chatter] - What's the story?  - Spoke with the landlord. He says Deborah's car  isn't in the lot. It looks like she hasn't been  home all night. - She and Waterman  are holed up somewhere else. Anyone in the apartment now?  - Yeah, just her mom, Lorraine. Deborah lives with her.  - All right. - I don't understand  any of this. What do you want with Deborah? - We need to talk to her  about a friend of hers. - Did she ever mention the name Mark? - The boyfriend.  Debbie's crazy about him. But she never  brings him around. She's always going to see him. - How long since  your daughter's been home? - She left last night  and hasn't been back. I had to get my own breakfast. I had to remember  to take my pills. - What medications do you take, Mrs. Strong? - Everything under the sun. Pills for pain,  pills for my cholesterol, pills to help me sleep,  pills to wake me up. - Baltoxin? - Well, that one  keeps my heart beating. [tense music] - Excuse us one second. ♪ ♪ Are you thinking  what I'm thinking? - Maybe Deborah smuggled in a few of those pills into jail on one of her visits. - And Waterman takes the pills, makes his healthy heart  start to race. Looks like he's having  a heart attack. - Yeah. - Suzy Lim  was tutoring Waterman. If he and Deborah  were planning an escape, maybe she got onto it. Calvin Hayes said  she was a snitch, remember? - Then Ed Roven gets Hayes to murder her before she can tell the warden. - Exactly.  - Think I found something. Two weeks ago, Deborah rented a furnished apartment in a building on Barber Street. - Mrs. Strong? Was Deborah planning  to move out? - Of course not.  Who would take care of me? - According to the building manager, Deborah only picked up the key yesterday. - That must be  where they're hiding out. - Let's get the marshals  over there.

He said "police," and... [voice breaking]  And then he ran out. - We just missed him. Check  the emergency stairs, now. - Yes, sir.  Let's go. - He knew we were coming.

She's unstuck, too, and I don't know how to find her. I was hoping maybe you could. - The last vocabulary word  I learned before I died was "vast"-- a very great extent  or quantity.

Ed was gonna tell him  what to do next. - Ed Roven? - He didn't give me  a last name. But I heard them talking  this morning in the other room. That was right before  Mark attacked me. I thought the four of us  were leaving together, but then Mark said,  "Plans change, Cottontail." - Detectives, we need  to get her to a hospital. - Hang on, we're almost done. - What do you mean  the four of you? - Mark and me  and Ed and Ed's girlfriend. - Who's Ed's girlfriend? - I never met her...
