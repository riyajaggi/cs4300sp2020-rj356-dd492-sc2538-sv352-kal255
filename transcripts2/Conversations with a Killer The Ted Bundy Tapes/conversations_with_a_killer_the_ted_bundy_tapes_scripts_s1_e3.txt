 {\an8}[man] We're up in Aspen. {\an8}We're scheduled for a preliminary hearing. I think Bundy was the only case on the criminal docket that morning. {\an8}I thought the court proceedings were going very well. We took the morning recess as always. So we went our separate directions. I was out in the hallway smoking a cigarette, talking to one of the deputies... and Ted was in the back of the courtroom, where the law library is. He was doing research. I was sitting out in the hallway, having a cigarette,

 when the Sheriff's deputy came along and asked if I knew where Bundy was. My approach to things like that is usually pretty whimsical, and I thought that was funny. And I said, "It's not really my turn to watch him." And the next thing I know, everybody's running into the courthouse. Somebody from the first floor came up and said somebody jumped out of the second floor window. Before anybody knew, he was gone. And, uh, that was it for the court proceedings for the day. [theme song playing] [opening song playing] {\an8}Good evening. Convicted Utah kidnapper Theodore Bundy has escaped. {\an8}Escaped from an Aspen, Colorado courtroom and remains, at this hour, the subject of a manhunt.

 What happened was seemingly inane but it's what took place. He jumped out of the courthouse and he was gone. [tires screech] And the next thing I know, the Sheriffs were running out of the courthouse and down the street. I mean, they took off trying to find him. It-- It was kind of a surreal experience. {\an8}[Lucas] I was there in Aspen after his escape from the courthouse. {\an8}Obviously, they weren't paying attention to how significant this serial killer was. That was irresponsible. It's one of those things that shouldn't have happened. [reporter] Guards waited outside the room but Bundy was alone inside when he decided to open that window and jump the 25 feet to the ground. In fact, you can still see the indentations in the grass here, where he landed. From here, Theodore Bundy decided to head for the hills. [Leidner] There was nobody looking after him. He wasn't shackled, he wasn't chained, he wasn't handcuffed. They didn't have a waist chain on him and they kind of let him roam freely throughout the, uh-- the courtroom. It was inconceivable to me that you would have somebody accused of first-degree murder, who by that time was thought to be involved in a series of murders throughout the West, and that your security level would be so low. I really don't know what happened this morning in terms of the guard. {\an8}Basically, uh, as I understand it, {\an8}the defendant was in the courtroom and, uh... the guard was at the door and the last time he looked, the defendant was there, and the next he looked, he was gone. [chuckles] So he didn't keep him inside at all times? -Apparently not. -Will he be disciplined for that? [chuckles] I assume so. [Bundy] I remember the beautiful, clear morning. The mountain top shining with the first rays of... the summer morning's light. I remember psyching myself all the way up saying to myself again and again, "You must go. You must go, you must go, you must go. Don't hesitate, don't stop, don't stop." [Leidner] The question is, does he know where he's going? Does he know anything about this area? There's only two roads out of Aspen. How is he going to get out of here? {\an8}[reporter] Roadblocks have been set up all around Aspen. {\an8}City police and Pitkin County Sheriff's deputies are checking every car leaving this mountain community. [reporter #2] So far these roadblocks have turned up no sign of Ted Bundy, but sources report nine others have been arrested in connection with other cases and officers have confiscated 200 pounds of marijuana. [Lucas] It was crazy. The cops didn't know what was going on. We'd go around talking to the police about the escape, "What do you know about it?" And nothing. My photographer and I spent hours driving up and down in the woods, combing the hill trying to-- to locate this idiot. [Leidner] People were showing up on horseback with the bandoleros strung across their chest, with rifles probably half lit, ready to go out and hunt Bundy. [reporter] The Sheriff's department said 150 men and five bloodhounds combed the canyons around Aspen. [Lubeck] This was a catch-me-if-you-can game that he was engaged in, {\an8}and he was interested in one thing, and that is doing what he wanted. [dog sniffing] [Bundy] It certainly did cause a furor. They didn't know where in the world I was. And I was feeling really good. I had nobody helping me, I had no money, I had no nothing. [reporter] Using the scent from a sweater Bundy left behind, dogs did track him to a bridge in town, then they lost the trail. [Bundy] Just ran right up into the mountains and managed to find a cabin. [reporter] The search around Aspen, now in its third day, is being wound down. But the spokesman for the Pitkin County Sheriff's Department says the dragnet will definitely continue. [Michaud] For days and days and days, {\an8}he kept the level of interest and the guessing... uh, going. At that point, the FBI entered the case because Bundy became an interstate fugitive fleeing from justice. They could throw a lot of bodies and equipment at the investigation, manpower, vehicles. But even then, the FBI was not much help. They didn't know anything that the locals didn't already know. [Bundy] If I could've kept on hiking I would have been long gone but a very cold sleet and rain storm hit me and I got very cold and went into a state of shock. Three, four days of high altitude and cold got to me and my mind got weak. I was just totally disoriented. It was like an experience I had never known before. That night I went and walked back into Aspen because I was cold and hungry. And I just said, "Well, let's just see what happens." And a fluke actually, they stopped me. [camera shutters clicking, reporters shouting indistinctly] [reporter] Streets of Aspen are safe again. Suspected multiple murderer Theodore Bundy is back in custody after an absence of nearly seven days. {\an8}Bundy came here Wednesday after spending a miserable night in the rain. {\an8}He told officers he broke into this cabin, where he ate and slept Wednesday night. Then last night, Bundy said he walked into Aspen, took this car which was unlocked and had the keys in the ignition. He was on his way out of town but for some reason made a U-turn. That's when Bundy was apprehended. {\an8}I noted a vehicle driving erratically {\an8}about an eighth of a mile east of Aspen on highway 82. We observed this vehicle for a matter of seconds, and I turned around and pursued it, contacted it, and found Mr. Bundy driving it. [woman] Did you recognize him right away? It took about two glances. He was pretty... altered, his appearance had been altered by glasses and, uh... a minor growth of beard. [reporter] When Ted Bundy emerged from the courtroom, he was barefoot, haggard. He limped from the blisters on his feet and he weighed 25 pounds less than he did last Tuesday, at the time of his escape. [Lucas] When he was recaptured in Aspen, there in the courthouse in the crowd, in that famous shot where Bundy is walking into that crowd of reporters, he came past me, turned to me and said, "Hi, Ward." And two or three of the reporters standing around me said, "Who the hell are you?" It was very odd. But he obviously had been watching or listening paying attention to any time his name was used on the air, or in print. [camera shutter clicks] He was a narcissist along with being a psychopath, so I think he watched every TV newscast he could. I wouldn't be surprised if he saved newspaper clippings. Some people with his mindset do. [Bundy] I know of course the officers believed that I would be depressed. Dejected as well as... in a state of physical exhaustion. And that... the inevitability of it all would shake me and that I was just a... a rotten tomato ready to burst. And all it would take would be this extraordinary circumstance to open me up. But my exhaustion notwithstanding, they were barking up the wrong tree. [Carlisle] Once he got caught and he was in jail, {\an8}he called-- He had a credit card that he could use. {\an8}And he called and we talked and talked for about 15 minutes or so. -[Bundy] How you doing? -Doing pretty good, Ted. How you doing? [Bundy] Uh, well, quite well, quite frankly, yeah. [stammering] There is still the scars from the blisters on my feet. -I'm sitting here bare footed. [laughs] -Uh-uh. [Bundy] From running around in the mountains. Extraordinary experience. -[Carlisle] They treating you pretty good? -Um... They, they have developed this paranoia about me. -Like I am going to escape or something. -[chuckles] I can't imagine where they are getting that. [Bundy laughs] -Yes, exactly. -Uh-uh. [Bundy] You know, we haven't really... [clears throat] you know, talked personally, obviously, since the latter part of January. [Carlisle] Yeah, right. [Bundy] Well, the impressions of all that you have been hearing about me and you know, the... [Carlisle] Okay. How do you mean? [Bundy] Well, like, the escape and everything like that. I wonder what your impression of that was. [Carlisle] Uh... I had mixed impressions. I was wondering if you were really getting uptight. And the pressure looked like it was on. In your own mind, what was happening? -[Bundy] Well... -What was the reason for... [Bundy] I just got sick and tired of being locked up, and... I had-- Over the months, I had noticed a number of opportunities to just walk right out. Just longed for freedom for so long and now I'm like... like I was living my ultimate dream. It was just an incredible experience. [Carlisle] It's almost like he's talking to a father and saying, you know: "I almost did a home run". You know, in the baseball game. It was so friendly. He was really quite proud of that. [Leidner] He talked about how lucky the people were to catch him, and how stupid the people were who caught him... and how... intellectually superior he was to everybody. And I thought to myself, "Those things may be true but you're the one in jail, and those are the ones who are on the outside." [reporter] Theodore Bundy left here in the midst of a hearing concerning his upcoming murder trial. If that's what he hoped to avoid, he didn't really accomplish much by escaping. He's back in jail, that hearing resumes Thursday morning, and now Bundy faces new charges... of escape. [Michaud] This is one of those strange dichotomies with Ted. He liked being the center of attention, but did not understand what kind of trouble came with it. The better known he was, the more he put himself under undue risk... but Ted did not see it that way. [Bundy] This kind of boldness that we see from time to time from this personality, um... it's probably just being willing to take the risk. Or perhaps not even seeing risk. Just overcome by that boldness and desire to accomplish a particular thing. To understand how he thought, you have to be able to project yourself into a sociopath's brain. If you can do that, um... more power to you. [chuckles] I'm-- It's a point of pride with me that I can't. [Bundy] I think we can say that he-- he felt almost as if he was immune... -[Michaud] Mm-hmm. -...uh... from detection, as if he were in a dimension that he just kind of, like, could walk through doors. That he had some supernatural powers. That no matter how much he fucked up, nothing could go wrong. [Michaud] December 30th, 1977, Ted is in prison waiting for trial for the murder of Caryn Campbell. That evening a guard, as usual, brought him his food and left. The next morning, the guard returned to Ted's cell, and found his food uneaten. He looked over and Bundy appeared to be in his cot, asleep. But as he entered the cell and pulled back the covers, he finds nothings but a pile of books, where Ted should have been. There was no Bundy. [indistinct shouting] [reporter] New Year's Eve, 1977. {\an8}In the Garfield County Jail, Bundy walked out. [female reporter] Bundy starved down to less than 140 pounds, slipped through a hole in the ceiling of his cell and was free again. [McChesney] The second escape, Ted was quite creative. Lost some weight, and hacked his way through the ceiling. He managed to climb on some books, lift himself into the ceiling, crawl through the ceiling area, {\an8}into the apartment of one of the jailers, which was above his prison cell. He took some of the jailer's clothing and walked out the front door. [Keppel] Bundy's second escape was pretty much of a nightmare. {\an8}That's the one where he just disappeared and no one knew where he went. [Leidner] Just could not believe it, could not believe that somehow he got out of there. That's what really was a scary situation. [Lucas] I was so disgusted with what had gone on. I think it was a travesty. The county commissioners of course are responsible {\an8}ultimately for the safety of prisoners. {\an8}The safekeeping of prisoners in a county facility. They were derelict in their duty. I can assure you that if anybody has been harmed by Mr. Bundy's leaving Garfield County on the first of January, that I intend fully to follow up uh, and file charges against people who were perhaps criminally negligent. [Leidner] It just brought to mind a little kid who's been denied candy for however much time, and this situation, it was like Bundy couldn't control himself. He had this opportunity and took off. [Lucas] He was this vicious killer who was just a complete and total con man, a psychopath. And he was running around out there. People began looking everywhere, because a serial killer doesn't quit until he is stopped. [Yocom] I got a call from the local authorities saying that Ted had escaped again. {\an8}We were afraid that he might be coming back to the Salt Lake area {\an8}and we certainly didn't want him back there. [chuckles] [woman] I heard about the escape on the news. {\an8}I was concerned with him being loose, {\an8}on what was going to happen to someone else. Just the magnitude of it was just very overwhelming and shocking. {\an8}Well, I'm concerned that this individual has been on the street, {\an8}and we of course take all necessary precautions and, uh... with our witnesses that testified against him in our case here... and of course will assist any way we can with Colorado to... um, see that he's apprehended. [female reporter] Are you worried that he might hurt somebody else? Well, there's always this possibility. [Keppel] There's law enforcement officers in Idaho, Colorado, Utah... all investigating Bundy. So we contacted everybody we could think of. Liz, his friends, his mother. Basically threatened them all with arrest, all in an effort to try and get them to tell us everything they could about Bundy. [siren wailing] Was he coming this way? We didn't know if he was or not. [male reporter] Assistant US Attorney James McConkey approved processing the document, which brings the Federal Bureau of Investigation into the hunt for Ted Bundy. [man] Wanted for questioning in connection with similar type sexual slayings throughout the Pacific northwest and into Utah and Colorado. {\an8}A federal warrant was issued on January 5, 1978 at Denver, Colorado, charging Bundy with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution for the crime of murder. [Lucas] If Bundy is ever recaptured, the Colorado prosecution will continue, and he could be prosecuted for one of the Utah murders before this thing is all over with. But for the moment, Theodore Bundy is merely an escaped convicted kidnapper. And now one of the FBI's most wanted men. [McChesney] Even with the FBI involved, sharing information was a real challenge. There was no central database. There was no Internet. [phone rings] [Michaud] The FBI were limited in their reach to the general public. In those days, there was always a delay between what happened and getting the story. And so Ted was just a legend in his own time zone. [Bundy] The FBI knows that people are creatures of habit... that we have our little things that we like to do. And they just wait for a person to assume those habits again. The person has to examine his life and say, "What parts of my life are distinctive?" And then change them. Creating an identity... is-- is not terribly difficult to do at all. Frightened coeds at Florida State University in Tallahassee walked to class in groups today while detectives tried to track a man who slipped into a sorority house early yesterday and murdered two women. {\an8}[reporter] In the early morning hours, through a backdoor, {\an8}the Intruder came in, carrying an oak tree limb [reporter #2] The killer came in from the night, and then returned to it with an ease that has so far baffled police and left most coeds here terrified. [man] It all began at about 2:30 a.m. A call I'll never forget. {\an8}The frantic nature of the... {\an8}caller on the other end of the phone saying, "Sheriff, uh... we may have as many as four dead at the Chi Omega sorority house, Florida State University." -[sirens wailing] -[indistinct chatter] As I arrived, they were taking girls out on stretchers. I didn't know, and frankly they didn't either, whether they were dead or alive. It appeared that the person was attempting to be organized like it was necessary to do things in order. [reporter] Most Chi Os had come back from their dates and gone to bed. {\an8}That's where the intruder found Margaret Bowman asleep. {\an8}She never woke up. She died in her bed, beaten, strangled, sexually molested. [Katsaris] But you could tell that the person that did this was also losing control. {\an8}[reporter] Further down the hall, Lisa Levy was asleep. She, too, died without regaining consciousness. {\an8}Still further down the hall, roommates Karen Chandler and Kathy Kleiner {\an8}survived their attacks. {\an8}Both were asleep, neither saw their attacker. [Katsaris] When you walk into a room, with the intentions of harming someone but then end up brutalizing one, two, three, four-- It shocked even all of us who have seen... brutalization before. {\an8}When he hit the girls, I just don't think they had a chance to fight back. I think he just went in and hit. I just don't think they had a chance to cry out. [Katsaris] That same night, while I was outside, we got a call that crackled on my radio and said, "There are some real unusual noises coming from a duplex. The neighbor next door is calling in and saying, 'It sounds like somebody is really being beat up.'" And I said, "Could it be? Is it possible? Could the same person have gone to another location?" And I said, "No, in all my studies of criminology, crime, criminals and their methods, they do something like this, they're on the lam. They're gone. They don't want to be around. They're certainly not gonna commit another crime." I sent an investigator to that scene. It was only about six blocks away. {\an8}Sure enough, there laid a young lady, a dance major, brutalized, beaten, laying in a pool of blood. {\an8}Obviously, we had the same individual {\an8}who didn't get but a few blocks and couldn't stop himself. He brutalized them. Two to their death and three to his certainty that he had killed them. But he had not. [reporter] Florida Department of Criminal Law Enforcement crime lab experts are busy sifting through and analyzing evidence that was collected from the Chi Omega house. We were thinking, "Who could it be and how did he get there? And what methods were used and why?" I mean, the questions were just numerous. So I made my way to the morgue. There, as I examined the bodies of the two deceased girls, I saw that there was mutilation by mouth, by teeth. There was a very large, very imprinted, double bite mark. {\an8}[male reporter] What kind of a person do you think is at large? {\an8}Well, I'd rather say {\an8}we've got a very disturbed, sick individual. [birds chirping] [girl] Everybody's scared all the time. Even just walking to classes. And today, we've been keeping our doors locked during the day too, which we don't usually do. [man] There'd never been a crime like this before in Tallahassee. There was a tenseness in the air. {\an8}A nagging fear, a nagging question, {\an8}that could not be just pushed aside. I was a 28-year-old journalist down at WFSU TV in Tallahassee. Across the street from the TV station was a Chi Omega sorority house. We had coeds who were savagely attacked. And nobody knew who was responsible for this, but they were still out there. [helicopter thrumming] You'd hear helicopters flying overhead at night, buzzing across the city. [reporter] Police continue to guard the Chi Omega house around the clock, but the girls who live there haven't slept in the house since last weekend and there's no word on when they'll return. Everybody wanted answers. Obviously, we didn't have any answers. We did call the FBI, but they were not very helpful. They started working on getting together a profile of the type of person we might be looking for, but unfortunately a profile could apply to so many people. It's good when you have the person that did it, and say, "Aha! See? It matches." But you couldn't take that profile and go out and find the person. It just doesn't work that way. {\an8}We are trying to establish the whereabouts, um, {\an8}and if certain people and so on could've been in the Tallahassee area. Yes. It's just running down every lead to the nth degree, rather than allowing anything to slip by. [Katsaris] Every County in Florida was frightened. Window locks, door locks, padlocks. I mean, the stores were selling out of everything, {\an8}because people thought, "Goodness, there's a murderer on the loose." {\an8}[man] Lake City was, you know, small town USA. {\an8}Everybody knew everybody. People didn't lock the front door, left keys in the car in the driveway. Kids just walked all over town. {\an8}And Kim Leach was just a small-town girl. [reporter] 12-year-old Kimberly Diane Leach went to school Thursday, February 9th, {\an8}here at Lake City Junior High School. By mid-morning, she was missing and no one has seen or heard from her since. [Dekle] First I heard of the disappearance of Kim Leach, I was driving to the hospital to visit my wife who had just delivered our third child and I heard about it on the radio. [male reporter] She exited this building and walked across this basketball court. But from then on, the whereabouts of Kimberly Diane Leach is unknown to the Lake City Police Department. [Dekle] It was a real whodunit. We had a missing person to begin with, but we didn't have Kim Leach's body. It was a monumental task. [reporter] A wide search is being made for Leach in Lake City. More than 75 state troopers, Florida Division of Forestry workers, deputies and others are helping out in that hunt. [birds chirping] [Bundy] That day in Pensacola had been one of the best I'd spent. It was sunny, I'd gone to the ocean, laid on the beach. And I said to myself-- I remember saying to myself that day, "Boy, you've got it whipped." You know? "This is the way to start out 1978, laying on the beach in the Gulf of Florida." And just laying there in the sand and getting a bit of a tan. I mean, I was super confident and I was just-- just feeling really satisfied with the way things were. [reporter] Police arrested this 31-year-old man after a high speed chase Wednesday morning in Pensacola, Florida. He claims to be a Florida State University law student. [Katsaris] An officer in Pensacola, doing his job very well, stopped a car that, in his gut, said, "This isn't right, it's going slow." It just didn't look right. [reporter] Who is this man? He was arrested driving a stolen Tallahassee car, and carrying 21 stolen credit cards, many of which belonged to FSU coeds. He refused to give his name to authorities and he resisted arrest with violence. [man] He grabbed my wrist and we had a struggle for control of my revolver. {\an8}After several minutes of fighting, I did manage to subdue him {\an8}by striking him with my revolver {\an8}and completing the arrest by placing the cuff on his other hand {\an8}and taking him back to the patrol car. {\an8}[Katsaris] For the initial period {\an8}that he was being held in Pensacola County Jail, he had another name. [reporter] He told police that he was 29-year-old Kenneth Misner of Tallahassee, and even had ID cards to prove it. [Katsaris] That person heard that he was in jail and notified us and said, {\an8}"Hey, that's not me. I'm here. {\an8}I'm not over there. I didn't do this." [Dekle] Police didn't know who they had in Pensacola. He handed over a driver's license, {\an8}but, you know, driver's licenses in 1979 in Florida {\an8}were printed on a little piece of paper, {\an8}almost like, you know, you'd put the form into a typewriter and type it out. There's no picture on them. [reporter] When the real Misner was located at home, he admitted the IDs were phony. He was ordered held without bond by a circuit court judge this morning after he again refused to identify himself. [judge] Are you acquainted with or are you familiar with the charges against you as outlined by the state's attorney? I would like the court to, um, list them again. I don't believe I picked everything up from the state's attorney. [judge] This is for possession of stolen property, an automobile, possession of a stolen television, uh... possession of stolen credit cards on 21 accounts, possession of stolen tags, that is automobile tags, battery of a police officer and resisting arrest with violence. [public defender] He is entitled to a bond on these cases. [judge] We can't bail him out if we-- We don't even now who he is, he won't tell us who he is. Who would be the principal on the bond? Your Honor, all I know is what they say. I don't know whether he's given his name or not. He's certainly entitled to a bond in any event I would think. [prosecutor] Your Honor, the public defender heard the man admit that he is not the person whose name he gave and he has failed to come forward with his correct name. [judge] Well, until we find out who he is, there's no way we can bail him out. [public defender] All right. [reporter] The mystery man will be kept behind bars before returning to court to enter a plea. Officials say by then, they hope to know who he is. [Katsaris] We have an individual, we don't know who he is yet. So it became an information-gathering process, and we focused on the car. There was no hair fibers. There were no trace evidence of any kind. But we did identify that it was a stolen vehicle, stolen from nearby... the Chi Omega house. {\an8}I thought, you know, this might be our first potential suspect. {\an8}So I sent investigators to Pensacola and we started to learn more about him. [male reporter] Two people who want most to know who he is are Tallahassee detectives Steve Bodiford and Don Pachen. They have now spent several hours quizzing Mr. Mystery about the slayings last month of two Florida State University coeds from St. Petersburg. [Katsaris] We started investigating and talking to him, asked him if he would talk to us, and he was reluctant. He started playing games. He's a very careful thinker, and from what I understand, he-- from the men who've been questioning him-- he says what, uh... what he wants to, and he's very careful about how he says it. [Katsaris] For a while, I let him play his games with my investigators until I said, "Enough." And then it started unraveling. [Bundy] I was being interrogated by the police in Pensacola. And I have no way of measuring... on a scale of one to ten, or one to a hundred even what-- what the traumatic effect on my mind and body was. And I said I wanted to talk to somebody. Just someone to talk to-- I needed a friend, I needed somebody close. I didn't want a cop or an attorney. I was sick and tired of cops. I needed somebody there. Somebody to talk to. Somebody to settle me down and to help me get over this... reaction I was having being back in custody. He finally identified himself in exchange for a phone call to his girlfriend Liz. [male investigator] The date is 2/21/78. The time is 15:20 hours. This will be an interview with Elizabeth Kloepfer. Could you begin on February 16th, '78 and describe the telephone call that you received from Ted Bundy? [woman] Uh, he called collect, my daughter accepted the charges. And he said that he was in custody and I asked him where and he said Florida. He repeated over and over again that this was really going to be bad when it broke. That it was not going to break until tomorrow morning and be in the press, but it was going to be really ugly. And I asked him... if he was referring to the murders of some sorority girls in Florida, and he said that he wouldn't talk about it. He told me that he wished that we could sit down and talk about... things without anyone listening. About why he was the way he is, and I said, "Are you telling me that you're sick?" And he said-- He was really defensive and he told me to back off. Saturday morning at two, he called again... collect. And he said that he wanted to talk about what we'd been talking about. He told me that he was sick and that he... was consumed by something that he didn't understand and that, um... that it-- that he just couldn't contain it. He spent so much time trying to maintain a normal life and he just couldn't do it. He said that he was preoccupied with this force. [Michaud] Ted was identified, and at that point, the jig's up, right? [reporter] The police in Pensacola, Florida, stopped a man driving a stolen car and found to their surprise, and perhaps pleasure, it was Theodore Robert Bundy, one of the ten most wanted criminals in this country. [Michaud] It was remarkable that Ted was able to elude the police for so long. But Ted had that sort of chameleon-like face that could look 100 different ways, depending on the angle that you caught it. He was handsome and smooth-talking. That allowed him to do what he did. And Ted told me that after he escaped Colorado, he got himself on a bus, took the bus to Denver. At Denver, he got a flight to Chicago. In Chicago he got on an Amtrak train and went to Ann Arbor, and was there to watch his alma mater, the University of Washington, play the University of Michigan in the Rose Bowl. He got drunk watching it in a college bar and almost got himself beat to shit by a bunch of Michigan fans. Spent the night in the sanctuary of a Methodist church, stole a car the next day, and got as far as... Atlanta, where he abandons it. He then takes a bus to... Tallahassee and Florida State University. [man] Well, why Florida in the first place? [Bundy] It was the very opposite end of the country from the Pacific Northwest. Not that I disliked the northern climate, but I didn't have the clothing and it was... It'd just be harder to get around and to live in a cold climate when you didn't have any money. I didn't know anybody in Florida, and I thought the likelihood that Florida would know anything about Ted Bundy was remote. [McChesney] The fact that Ted was able to escape and get into Florida through a circuitous route sounds crazy, but back in the late '70s, we didn't have the technology that we have now. [Michaud] The authorities, including the FBI, had a very limited number of tools. No DNA, you know, no teletypes-- They didn't even have fax machines. You know, imagine a world where most of the communication is done by US mail or rotary telephones. And so they were always at least a step behind Ted. And he believed, "I can't get caught doing this." [Katsaris] After all the grief that he created, it was a traffic stop! A traffic stop that we got him on. [male reporter] Authorities say they can place Bundy in Tallahassee in January and he has become a prime suspect in the Chi Omega sorority house murders. [indistinct clamoring] [Keppel] I believe Kathy McChesney read it in the newspaper that Bundy had been arrested in Florida. So we were pleased to know it. We weren't pleased that somebody was murdered, but... {\an8}certainly it was, uh... {\an8}a good start. [McChesney] Ted was a absolutely prime suspect for the Chi Omega, and he was placed just, you know, within miles... of where the offenses occurred. [reporter] Many of the 21 credit cards Bundy had with him were stolen in Sherrod's, a bar next to the Chi Omega sorority, on Jefferson Avenue. {\an8}[reporter #2] Bundy lived in this house, which is four blocks from the Chi Omega sorority. He was there for several weeks before and after the killings. Frances Messier lived across the hall from Bundy and knew him as Chris. What kind of person was he? Um, a quiet-type person. {\an8}Aloof and friendly. You'd gone out to dinner with him one time? We went out to dinner once. Yes, that, that's kinda... [chuckles] {\an8}[Dekle] At this point, Bundy was also a suspect as the potential killer of Kim Leach. {\an8}We tracked a number of stolen credit cards {\an8}that we found in his possession {\an8}and found that he had spent the night at the Lake City Holiday Inn {\an8}two and a half miles from... the Lake City Junior High School the night before Kim went missing. Uh, that's a pretty good indication you might want to look at him as a possible suspect. [male reporter] Bundy allegedly spent the evening after he checked in sitting in the motel's bar, sipping gin while chatting with a man next to him for several hours. Bundy checked out of the Lake City Holiday Inn the next morning at about 7:30, the same morning Kimberly Leach disappeared. But before we could make any kind of a homicide case, we had to find the body. And some time about a month and a half later, we had found what we were looking for. [reporter] Eight weeks of searching led to her body. in a deserted tin shack, next to an empty hog pen. [Dekle] Worst thing in the world a prosecutor can do is get personally involved in a case. And, uh... I had not cried in my entire adult life. I hadn't cried since I was a teenager. I cried the day we found Kim Leach's body. She was just a... smart, intelligent, obedient, little girl who, uh... reminded me of my daughter. [woman] To actually have a 12-year-old child taken from our community and brutally murdered by some monster-- Just grabbed her up and took her away-- It's just shock and disbelief. [Katsaris] I told Ted Bundy, we now have the evidence to charge him with both cases. He looked at me and said, "When you find the person... that committed these crimes that you think I committed... that person... is going to be wanted for... murders of women in the three digits... and... six states." And he put his fingers up like that. {\an8}[Dekle] Ted Bundy was one mad-dog killer {\an8}and I wanted him executed, {\an8}but he had not been indicted in either case. So I spent a good deal of time in Tallahassee conferring with the, uh, prosecutors in Tallahassee about the Tallahassee case. Which case should be tried first. I felt that, uh, Bundy ought to be tried in Tallahassee first, because they had a much more secure jail in Tallahassee. [Katsaris] My goal was to never... ever allow him to kill another young lady. So we put him into a secure portion of the jail. And then we had three locks on the door: the traditional key lock, the big key, the jail key, and then two very large, uh... very, very strong padlocks. One night, I did something unusual. And I went to his cell and I said, "Ted you're coming with me." And he said, "This is a change-up. This is different." I said, "We're going for a ride." And that didn't go over real well. I believe he thought I was going to take him for a ride from which he would never return, that I was going to exercise some kind of authority as the sheriff to do him in. We transported him with a series of cars and as we opened the back door to go up the stairway, the back entrance, doors swung open, and there stood these three doctors their white smocks on, and behind them was a dental chair. And he lost it. He didn't know that what I had was a bite mark from the crime scene, which, I believed at the time, was Ted Bundy's signature, and we wanted to search any and all parts of his mouth including his teeth. Well, he started screaming, "You can't do this without my attorney." I said, "Oh, yes, we can. Ted, we have a warrant and we're serving it on you." We showed him the devices that we could use as a degree of force. Then on a dime, his mindset changed like it was a different person. He looked at me... he turned around... he sat in the dental chair... he leaned back... put a smile on and said, "Ken, you know you don't need all that stuff. I'm not a violent person." He opened his mouth. He said, "Do what you have to do." [Hula] Everybody realized that there was somebody very special being held by the police in Tallahassee. The dots began to connect from all across the country. From Washington State to Utah, through the Rockies to Florida. We became a focal point of criminal justice inquiries in the weeks that followed. [Katsaris] Other investigators came to the jail to try to interview him for other cases they were working on, for which they didn't have evidence. That had to wait, because we had evidence and we had Ted Bundy in our custody, something the other investigators never had the luxury of. So I wasn't going to divert from the path we set. Period. And I will tell you I had a personal vengeance for the person that did this. I wanted to be the one to tell him that the grand jurors of this county have indicted you for murder. [Bundy] Gentlemen, I'm not gonna be paraded for Ken Katsaris' benefit. Step out, Mr. Bundy. [Bundy] What do we have here, Ken? Let's see. Oh, it's an indictment? All right. Why don't you read it to me? You're about up for election, aren't you? -This is how you got it, didn't you? -Mr. Bundy-- You told me, that you were going to get me. He said he was going to get me, okay? You got me indicted. It's all you're going to get. Just read it. Let's go. Theodore Robert Bundy, you are charged, indictment, two counts of burglary, and, uh, two counts murder in the first degree, three counts attempted murder in the first degree. In the name of, and by the authority of the State of Florida, the grand jurors of the State of Florida and panel that's sworn to inquire and true presentment make. And therefore the County of Leon upon their oath do present that Theodore Robert Bundy, on the 15th day of January 1978, in Leon County, Florida, did then there unlawfully kill a human being to wit: Margaret Bowman, by strangling and/or beating her, and said killing was perpetrated by said Theodore Robert Bundy, from or with a premeditated design or attempt to affect the death of said Margaret Bowman, contrary to Section 810-02 Florida Statutes. -Very good. -And your grand jurors being present further give the court to be informed and understand... [Hula] It wasn't a press conference. It was a staged perp walk by Sheriff Ken Katsaris. to make a big deal out of him arresting and charging Theodore Bundy. Katsaris in his black suit, and his cowboy boots on. It was part political theater, part crime drama. Said killing was perpetrated by said Theodore Robert Bundy from or with a premeditated design or attempt to affect the death -of said Lisa Levy... -My chance to talk to the press. ...contrary to section 780-204 Florida statutes. I'll plead not guilty right now. And your grand jurors being present in said court further gives the court to be informed and understand that Theodore Bundy -on the 15th day of January-- -Can I talk to the press when you're done? did then and there unlawfully attempt to kill a human being to wit... [Bundy] It ceased to be an issue whether or not I was innocent or guilty. The issue now is, "Can we pin it on him?" [stuttering] Can we follow through and maintain our reputation as law enforcement officers? The police aren't willing to accept what I think they know, and they know that I didn't do these things. That is the indictment handed down by the grand jury. -Is that my copy? -No, it is not. -Do I get a copy? -We have your copy. You have the copy? Can I have a copy? How about the case? -You get that. -Can I talk to the press? I mean, you had your chance. You've displayed the prisoner, now I think it's my turn. I've been kept in isolation for six months, I've been kept away from the press, I've been buried by you, you've been talking for six months, I think it's my turn now. All right? We got a court order that there won't be any press interviews. Sure there won't be any press interviews. You've given them up. I-- I'm gagged, you're not. All right. I'll be heard.
