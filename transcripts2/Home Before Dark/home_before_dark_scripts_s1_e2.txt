 That's it. No.-What are you doing down there? - Who's that man?-I saw the same weird triangle shoes - on Principal Collins.-That man is your grandfather, and this is his house. Matt, can you drive Izzy to school? I'm sure I'm gonna haveall kinds of papers to fill out. Yeah, I'm kinda busy right now. I think Principal Collins stole somethingfrom Penny - and then killed her.- Just take it easy. What if they have scary clowns there, Mommy? No, they won't have any clowns. You will sing songs and draw, and there'll beall kinds of toys and playtime. What if one of the toys is a clown?

Your grandpa needsa little help right now, okay? Jane! Did I leave my good bootsin the mudroom? -I need my boots. Jane?-Dad. Dad, Mom's gone. She's not here. Okay? Here, Pop-Pop. Two sugars, no milk. So there's this locked cabinet, and I just had this feeling... Where's the damn Chairman? I need the littlest at the frontdoor, fed and ready in ten seconds. - Not right now, Hilde.-There's the Chairman. Right there. - No, don't! Just be careful.-Dad, you're not even listening to me! I solved Penny Gillis' murder! -Hilde, come on! Stop it, Hilde.-Stop. Come on. Let it go. Whoa, whoa, whoa, I know what you're all going to say. - And yes, I have proof.- And I'm out. - We need the Chairman of the Board.- I know. I get it, I get it. Could you just put your arm in the jacket? You're not gonna do it? Learn to read the room, genius. Let's go. Come on. You got it? Okay? You gonna be okay? All right. - Okay. I'll see you later.-Okay. Have a good day. -Good luck.-Hey, it's good to see you. You too, Sylvester. Where's the one with the blue eyes? I always loved the girlwith the blue eyes. Yeah, okay. Come on, Dad. - You okay?-Yeah. Okay, watch your step. -It's cold.-Yeah. No, no. I know. I know. Look where you're going, Dad. Don't take me back to that prison. Hey, come, come on, come on. It's not a prison. Okay? It's your home. You like it here. Dad... what's in the safe in the attic? Huh? Why did you wall it off? I was worried about the house. People killing people again. That's why I escaped, Frankie. No, no. I'm not Frankie, Dad. It's Matt. It's your son. I know. I know. Okay, come on. Come on. Let's get you inside. Come on. Mr. Sipple? I'm gathering some facts for an upcoming storyin The Magic Hour Chronicle. Would you mind if I asked youa few questions about my father? In the yearbookit said you were his science teacher. Your dad's Matt Lisko, right? Now, he was a pain in my butt. Spent most of his time making jokes. The other kids all loved him. I was young and just wanted to teach. Your dad wanted to laugh. My dad? Until... Richie Fife. Everything changed. From that moment on... it was before, before, before... and after. Hey. -Hey.-Um, pro tip. If you have to Photoshop your cool, it means you're not cool. And next time, maybe don't use the first picture that comes up on Google Images. Au revoir. Congratulations. Welcome to detention. You have all chosen to extendyour school day by one hour. - - Aw. If you don't like it, you willmake better life choices next time. Read quietly, do your homework, or you can join me again tomorrow. Hey, guys. How are you doing? -Hey, Hilde.-Hey. Hey. You okay? Well, other than the fact that my life sucks and my sister sucksand the Jessicas suck, sure, I'm great. I heard about the Paris incident. Well, hey, at least your Photoshoppingwasn't bad. - It was stupid.-Nah, you got skills. I'm into that stuff. -Really?-Yeah, you should follow me. You know I need, like, actual information to do that, right? - Oh.- Uh. Here. Whoa, where'd you take these? Right in town. I can show you. Ooh, look at this place. Come on. Let's go. Ooh, do you wanna go sit over there? Hi, um, I'm Bridget Jensen. We spoke on the phone. It was Ginny, right? Wow. Good memory. I cheated. Filled in the paperworkwhen we got off the phone. Oh. Oh, sorry. Uh, I kept my maiden name. She has her dad's last name. It's Lisko. L-I-S-K-O. You know what? Just give me a sec. What's going on? - Clover.-A clover? You should color that more. Oh. I'm so sorry. But your daughter puts usout of compliance with state ratio requirements. But you knew we were coming. You did the paperwork. Yeah. Yeah. There's a great day care on 14th. It was so nice meeting you. You too. Ginny, come on. Let's go. Before Mommy loses her shit. Your older daughter's quite the reporter, isn't she? Yes. Yeah. She is. Is she sleeping? I think she's reading. Those eyes are definitely closed. Ah. Ah. Fire. She's sleeping. Okay, then. What is that? Research. See that little girl? That's Principal Kim Collins. Can't believe she used to bea kid. And you see that kid right there? That's Richie Fife. They're together in every picture. So when Richie Fife disappeared31 years ago, Principal Collins lost her best friend. The guy they put away for abducting him, that's Penny Gillis' brother, Sam Gillis. So Principal Collinsmust have hated Penny forever. Then why kill her now? I don't know. She stole some videothat shows the kidnapping. I think Penny was going to use itto get Sam outta jail. To be continued. We need to go back to Penny's houseto gather more evidence. But... isn't that a crime scene? Exactly. I do not feel good about this. Just sto... Stop pulling back. That's it. That's it. - Let go of my foot.-Just let me do the last bit here. Just relax, would you, please? I'll relax whenthe Chairman of the Board gets here. Yeah, who's the Chairman of the Board? -Hey.-Hey. - What are you doing here?-Who the hell are you? Come on. It's me, Frankie. Remember? Frankie, I don't know who this crook is. He's been cutting on my feet all daywith knives. - Dad, don't tell him that.-He won't let me talk to the Chairman. What? -Who is the Chairman?-Come on. - He's been saying that all day.- Yeah? Well, he loves Frank Sinatra. -Come on, the Chairman of the Board.-Oh. There you go. Attaboy. - Didn't know you were back in town.-Yeah, yeah. I just got in. Been a while. What, 25 years? I thought you were never coming back. Yeah, well, I came when my mom passed, so... Yeah, that's right. Four hours, six years ago. You know, people are supposed to come home, Matt. Visit family, visit friends. Yeah, my sister's great. Thanks for asking. You know, my dad called me "Frankie" today. You been stopping by here a lot? What? There something wrong with that? Someone needed to look after him. No, it's just, you know, cost me an arm and a legto have him here. So... Oh. Yeah, well, you ripped himout of his own home without coming in personto see what was going on. Yeah, I could hear in his voicethat he needed more help. I'm glad you gota thorough diagnosis, Matty. Hey, don't call me that. Who did it? Who killed Penny? Nobody, Syl. It was an accident. A terrible accident. -Whoo-hoo! Come on!-This is so fun! - Let's go!- Whoo! Yay! Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! Slow down! Wait up! Anyone know how to pick a lock? I do. Fun. What is your problem? Are you gonna pay for that? - Did you have any other ideas?- I'm not cleaning that up. Why did you break the glass? This isn't even our house. - Yeah, there's glass on the floor!- Why? Why did you break the glass? - So what?-I know you broke it! -Yeah. I did!-You gonna pay for that? - You see... Boys! Get it together. Just go. Just go. Hilde's always right. Why didn't you just crawl through? I was just giving you options. I was just giving you options. I don't think we should be here. If we get busted, this is gonnago on our permanent records. There's no such thingas a permanent record. That's just what adults say to scare us. Well, it works. Look. Ew. Gross. I can't believe a person died, like, right here. They said she felltrying to change a light bulb. But how could she reach it? Did she use one of those pole things? Well, maybe the police put it awayor took it as evidence. If they didn't think it was a murder, why take evidence? The light's not burnt out. And there is no broken bulb on the ground, so it just doesn't make sense. I'm going to check outthe rest of the house. Whoa. Wow. I wish my house was this coolwhen I grew up. Games! This joystick only has one button. What are you evensupposed to do with that? Oh, okay. We have pets, and we got cemeteries. Is this movie rated R because... Don't ask questionsyou don't want the answer to. Did I do something wrong at day care? You think I'd buy you ice creambefore dinner -if I was mad at you?-No. "No" is right. I will be right back, okay? I just need to take care of this. Hi, um, I'm sorry to interrupt. You ladies wouldn't happen to havea good day care you'd recommend? I'm new in town, and it would really help me out. I'm pretty sure mine is full. Oh. Okay. Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, I want sprinkles! Ginny, restaurant, restaurant voice. But we're outside. Yep, you are. Did I do something wrong? Is this aboutthe article my daughter wrote? I'm sorry. Excuse me. Gi-Ginny? Ginny! Where did you... You totally jumped. Did not. That's so creepy. You want creepy? You should seewhen they wheel out a gurney with a body bag on it, and you know what's inside. I used to go to work with my dada lot... in New York. It's a little sketchy. Well, this whole townis filled with creepy things. Women get killed, kids disappear, and there's weird creatures in the woods. I hear they're a hybrid of wolf-coyotes. And we all know they eat people. Well, they eat cows, but if theycan eat cows, they can eat people. One time, these kids in my brother's class swore they saw Richie Fifeby the boathouse. Well, his ghost anyway. - Go, go, go.- Go, go, go, go! Go, go. This way. Here. You know I have pepper spray, right? You're not gonna spray methough, are you? I don't know. Was thinking about it. I can't believeSylvester's your grandfather. I can't believe you work at his old shop. - Small town, right?- How is he? Uh, I don't know. Fine, I guess. - It really is beautiful here.-This isn't even it yet. Come on. Here, watch your step. - Whoa, whoa, whoa.-Whoops. This is my land. Actually, maybe it's our land now. Yeah. What were you even doing way back here? I don't know. I... I had this fight with my dad. And I-I'd just seen this movie,The Jungle Book. Not the cartoon one. The real one. And I just thoughtl could be Mowgli, you know? Live in the woods. But then I got hungry, so... What was the fight about? It was... Whatever. Yeah. Totally. Sorry. It's okay. I get it. At least you have two sistersto hang out with. More like one sisterand one big, giant attention hog who sucks up all the light and airin the world. I swear, if you and I reallymoved out to the woods, I don't think my family would even notice. Do you want to? Maybe. Do you? Maybe. What was that? Oh, my God. Ethan? Really? Really, Ethan? Oh, shit. Hi. Uh, my, my daughter was... She was just playing outside. - Did she come back in here?-Not since she got her ice cream. - Oh. Okay.- Ginny! Ginny! Excuse me. - Have you guys seen a little girl?- Ginny! Have you seen a little girl? She's about this big. Ginny! Ginny! Oh. Hey, Trip. Hilde, what are you doing here? Oh, thank God. Ginny, you gave me a heart attack. What is wrong with you? I should call your parents. You kids have no business being in here. And who broke the window upstairs? Huh? Neighbor called about a glass breaking. - -Did you bring a partner? I don't have a partner. Stay here. Come on. Hey! Holmes CountySheriff's Department. Get down! -Go!-Go, go, go! Go, go! You didn't catch him? Does it look like I caught him? Well, did you get a good look? Was it a him or a her? -Was it Kim Collins?-What? The Magic Hour Chronicle has reason to believe that... You're ridiculous. No comment. You kids need to go home. - Just go, go.-This is a crime scene. It's not a playgroundor your little secret hideout. So, you admit it's a crime scene. The official stanceof the Holmes County Sheriff is still that Penny Gillishad an accident. But you don't think that. That's why you came here. I'm here for broken glass. Really? Or did you just see thatwhen you got here? No. I'm not having a moment with you. Get outta here! Bye, Hilde! Bye! -I want an exclusive.-An exclusive? - Yes. That means... I know what it means, Hilde. Are you outta your... Do you know how much trouble I can get in? - -Don't worry. I always protect my sources. Oh. What are you? Woodward or Bernstein? I know I'm only nine years old, but I think I can help. Besides, I'm really good at this stuff. Put your bike in the trunk. Peach and cardamom kulfi. Thank you so much. This is great. Do you have sprinkles? Please. Por favor. S'il vous plaît. So I could get extra pointsif I say it in another language. - Wow. - That was way less annoyingwhen I taught you to do it. But yes, we'll get sprinkles. You go sit down. I thought that the stereotype was that everyone in a small townis supposed to be nice, but you're honestly the first one, so... You know that cold shoulderyou're bumping up against? It's not because of that articleyour daughter wrote. It's because of what your husband didwhen he was a kid. I was little, but the whole town knew about it. Did he never tell you? Dad. Dad. What are you doing? You're making paper airplanes. I thought we're supposed to bedrawing a picture. Mmm. He loves origami. Folds his papers no matter what projectwe're supposed to be working on. Uh, Dad, if you want me to lie tomorrow, I will. I'll lie. Why'd you tell me, Frankie? Dad, come on. Frankie's not here. Why'd you tell me... if you didn't want me to look into it? Look into what? You shoulda justkept your damn mouth shut! - Let's get you to bed, Syl.- No need to get upset. Syl? Why don't you finish that one? There you go. You're so good at these, hmm? Hey. Uh, is he in and out like that a lot? Like, you know what might trigger it? Someone changes the channelwhen it's time for Jeopardy! Could be anything. It's just he was talking about Frankie, you know, something that he told him. Any idea what that might be? Sorry. Sometimes he's in his own world. It's hard to get inside. But now that you're back in town, maybe you can spendsome more time with him. See if you can't, you know, break through a bit. Hold this for me. Keep it safe. -Hey.-Hey. Where's, uh, where's the tiny little one? Oh, she's playing out back. You okay? Yeah. Other than getting rejectedby the day care I spent the last two weeksresearching and obsessing over. Rejected? Wh... I thought you spoke to them. I did. Well, what happened? What do you think? I... I don't know. Uh, did Ginny curse at school? -I don't know.-No. What? They found outthat her last name is Lisko... and that you are her father. What do you mean? How could you have not told me? About what? -Really?-What? Damn it, Matt. You know, no. I think I knew that there was somethingyou were hiding. I mean, we never saw your parents. You always just saidyou loved Christmas with my family. But almost every year? And then the few timesl took the girls here alone, I just, you know, I just rationalizedthat you were busy with work. But... - Wait. Did my dad talk to you?-He didn't have to. There is a town full of peoplethat know more about my husband than I do. When you said that a kid was abductedfrom your hometown, you made it sound likeyou didn't even know him. Why didn't you tell me you wereright next to him when it happened? - That he was your best friend.- Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad. Mmm. -Uh, hi.-Bye, Mom. Bye, Dad. Excuse me. Where are you going? Where have you been all day? -At the crime scene.-Crime scene? -Did you find anything?-Yep. - But you're gonna have to read about it.-Come on. - Whoa, whoa, whoa.-Hilde, you've gotta be kidding me. Hey, what's for dinner? Where were you? And what happened to your pants? I went to the woods with a boy, but then a wolf scared him away, so... -Wait. There was a wolf?-There was a boy? I mean, wait. A boy? Yes. A male. -All right. Cool. Cool.-What... Daddy, you're home. Is Pop-Pop still here? No, sweetie. Pop-Pops is not here. He's gone. Listen. You know what? I can cook something if you want. - The littlest ate already, so...- What? - You ate already? Without us?- Mm-hmm. Yeah. - Because Mommy lost me.-Why? What happened? She lost you? What does she mean she lost you? What the hell happened today? I got it. I got it. - Come here. Come here.-I got it. - I'll take her. You get it.-All right. Why did you say that? I got it. Okay. Kim. -"Kim"?-"Kim"? Ew. I'm sorry to just... stop by like this, uh... I've been calling, but no one's answered their phones. - Yeah, it's been really busy. It's been...-Yeah, it's been crazy. Again, I'm sorry. It's just this is very important. Hilde stole from me. You stole from the principal? After she was in my office. I tried to show you this morning, but Pop-Pop was here! And you said, "Wait."And Izzy said, "Read the room," even thoughshe's basically obstructing justice since the principalis the primary suspect! "Suspect"? Wait. What did you say? Hilde, come on. Get upstairs now. -Matt. I got it. I got it.-Upstairs. Now. - But... Now! Oh, God. I'm... I am so sorry. No, I'm sorry. I'm guessingyou haven't watched the videotape? Can we use your mom's bike? Is that your mommy's? Whoa! Whoa! - Hey! Stop! Help!- Get off Richie! - Richie! Help! - Go, Matty! Richie! Richie! Richie. Help me! Kim! Kim! Kim! Where did you get this? Penny. She wanted to give it to you. But she asked me to make a copy for her. She knew I could... use the AV equipment at the school. So I told her I would. Then I left. Um, it's the last time I saw her. Where did she get it? And how comethis has never surfaced before? At the trial, there was never any tape. I don't know. She never told me anything. But you know how Penny was. Why did she want me to have it? She knew she couldn't take it to the cops. I mean, Penny spent her whole lifetrying to clear her brother. Maybe she figuredthat you could help her with that. Do you think Hilde was right? Do you think somebody killed Pennyover that tape? No. No, that wouldn't make any sense. You can barely see anything on it. No, there's no waythat would exonerate Sam. Right? Right. I knew she was the suspect. Hilde, we don't spy on people. - But, Mom, I... Now get in your room. Go to your room. I know it killed youthat your father didn't believe you. But Penny did. Yeah, I wish that made a difference. - Three kids. That's a lotta kids.- I know. It's a lot. They're great. -Hilde's just like you.-Oh, really? -Mmm.-What? A pain in the ass? She's smart. She's really, really smart. -Yeah.-And a pain in the ass. Right. -Well.-All right. -Okay. It's good to see you, Kim.-You too. All right. Take care. Drive safe, okay? Her eyes aren't that blue. Knock, knock. Can I come in? Hey, I'm sorry I yelled. Look, it's not that I don't wanna listento you or I don't believe you. It's just, on this... you're wrong. Wow. Is this an apology? Because it's really bad. Like, I feel like you shouldowe me an apology for this apology. Right. - -All right. Look, listen to me, okay? Look, Kim Collins did not kill Penny. They were best friends. - But the shoe prints, they were at the... The crime scene. I know. Kim went to Penny's earlier that night. She didn't steal the VCR. Penny gave it to her... before she died. Oh. Yeah. "Oh." You know, you didn't have the facts. You didn't have the sources. But you went ahead and printed out a storythat freaked out your grandfather so badly that he got up to check his housein the middle of the night. That's why Pop-Pop was here? And his feet got all cut up? Yeah. Yeah, you didn't even check with me. Kim Collins was a friend of minesince kindergarten. She's a friend of Penny's too. You think about that? You know, it's bad journalism, Hilde. The state calls Matt Lisko. Do the right thing, Matty. I'm sorry, but... it wasn't Sam Gillis. I don't know who it was. But I know for sure, it wasn't him. Come on! Damn it. What is this? I don't know. You know, when we moved here, Matt, it was... supposed to be so thatyou would hide less, not more. - Bridge, I'm not hiding, okay.-What about the safe? I've never seen it before in my life. -Really?-Really. I mean... You know, I asked my dad about it, but... Great. -More secrets.-Bridge, come on. I just wish I... I coulda helped you. I just wish I could help you. Is that why you got so wrapped upin that... story in New York? The missing girl? It's okay. Look, I knowit must've been traumatic, but you... - If you don't share these things with me... Bridge, Bridge. Okay, it was... That night was like the... the worst thing you could imagine. But then what happened after? Everyone wanted me to saythat Sam Gillis did it. They wanted a bad guy, you know? And I didn't geta good look at him that night. But I did hear his voice, and it was wrong. It-It wasn't Sam. So that's what I said. I mean, they just, they sent him to jail anyway. God. Uh, it doesn't matter anyway. None of it's gonna bring Richie back. Come here. - I'm sorry, Bridge. No, I'm so sorry.-It's okay. Come here. I'm sorry. Hey, Scout. Hey, you know, I think I owe you an apology. And, uh, a real one this time. And, you know, the reasonthat you didn't get it right is... Well, it's becausel didn't tell you the whole story. You know, my, uh... my best friend... he was taken right in front of me. And the, uh, the video that you saw. Yeah, well, that's me on the tape. Yeah. I know. I guess I just didn't want you to knowthat the world could be that scary. Dad, the scary thing is not knowing. Yeah. Yeah. Just promise me you'll take a second... just to be a kid. Okay, Daddy. I will. "An anonymous source confirms that some in the Holmes CountySheriff's Department believe this should bean open investigation." We're gonna make this go away. "News desk." At least I'm not a murderer in this one. Take this. Eat it. Dad, why does Hilde get the camera? Okay, what if I want it? And why is she so special? Well, I meant for the camerato be for the newspaper, so maybe you could be the photographer. Your plate. Stop it, okay? You're killing me. - Hello?- Family dinner. Sorry. - Hello?- Hello, this is a prepaid collect call from... Sam Gillis. An inmateat Northfield Corrections Center. This call is subject to recordingand monitoring. - Do you accept charges?-Um, uh, yeah, yeah. I accept. You may start the conversation now. Why are you calling me? I'm not. I'm calling for Hilde Lisko. Dad? I have a tip.
