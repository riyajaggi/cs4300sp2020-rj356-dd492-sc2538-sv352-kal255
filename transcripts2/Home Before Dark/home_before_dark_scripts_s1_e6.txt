 Get out of my bed! - What are you doing in my bed?-Dad, Dad, Dad. Just take it easy! It's okay. It's okay. All right? It's okay. - Mom! I can't find Mr. Peanut.- Have you looked under your bed? I'm gonna kill your dad. Right after I kill you. I know. I'm sorry. Look, I should've asked. I'm not a monster. I would've said, "Of course you should move him back home." I know, I know, I know, and you're right. You're right. I'm sorry. - -Yeah, let me make it up to you. -Yeah? I don't know if you can.-Yeah, okay. No, how can I make it up to you? I don't... It's not there! Dealing with that... would be a great start. - Yeah. -Okay. -All right, I got it.-Oh. I got it. Oh, my God. Hey, sweetie? Did Mr. Peanut climb into your backpack? And coffee. I want all the coffee in the world. Oh. I gotta hurry. I'm gonna be late. I think I made a mistake. You mean running against your dad? It's crazy, right? I mean, it's Oedipal, yeah. You know... I don't think I can remember himever being kind to you. I'm proud of you. -I gotta go.-Yeah. Thanks for coming over. This really is the last time. Time to get up, you guys. Come on. Let's up and at 'em, sports fans. Let's go. Come on. Hey, Hilde? Hilde? The copsreally messed up Sam's case. The sheriff never talkedto some witnesses, and now they're dead. Pop-Pop thought they lost some evidence, and he was right. You been up here all night? Sam's in jail because they screwed up. -Yeah.-They're supposed to be better. I know, and, and you're right. But, um, look, a uniform doesn't make a superhero. You know, cops are just human. They're usually trying to do their best. But that's why we... Right, we? We gotta fight. We gotta fight to make it right. It's reporters like uswho hold the powerful to account. We're like a pain in their butt just tomake sure they're doing their jobs. -You know what I mean?-Yeah. So what do we do now? We go back to the beginning. Right back to 1988, right? We reinvestigate every lead, right? Every lead we've ever had. So we can find out who murdered Richie. -Are you in?-Yeah. Okay, well, listen to me. First, you gotta look after yourself. Right? You can't writeif you die of starvation or lack of sleep. No, no, we-we need you focused. We need you sharp. Okay? All right, good. All right. Dad, do you know a guy that has a tattoothat says "sinner" on it? Pop-Pop made a note about it. No. No, no, I have no idea. I got it. Okay. Go to the dance with me tonight? I think I'm a little too old for you. - Mom, oh, my God. I got it.-You got it? -I got it.-Okay. What are you doing? - Come here.-What? -Check this out.-Oh. Look, I'm so sorry about my mom. She's such a weirdo. - Oh, my God, she's still watching us.- How have I never seen him before? I feel like all I dois drive the girls around and spy on them. -Wait, let me look at the guy.-Okay. Come on. Iz, I wanted to ask you, um... Hold on. Come on. Uh, okay, it was supposed to spell "dance" but the "E" poppedon the way over here, so... I would love to go to the dance with you. You sure? Sam. I got a, um, visitor for you. I waited 31 years... to sit across from you... and look you in the eye. Please tell me where you buried my son. I wish I could give you peace... but I didn't touch him. I swear on my life. Frank. Jack. Listen, that stuff my daughter'ssaying about me, it's not true. Cut down that goddamn tree. I've been studyingsome classical dance moves, like Heavy D from The Arsenio Hall Show and the "Rhythm Nation" video. Who cares about some dumb dance? Hey, my mom and I worked really hardon my costume. Fine. Then let's hustle. Here are the people you need to interview, and we're redoing the whole investigation. Sorry to call again, Mr. Mayor, but we need to talk. Um, and can you call me back at home? I'm running out of quarters. Any luck? Well, Mr. Sipple thinks Sam did it, so, no. Principal Collins says she doesn't knowanyone with a "sinner" tattoo, and she's gonna suspend me if I quote her. Next up are Richie's friends, my dad and Frank Briggs. -It's good, Matt.-Oh, crap. What? I said... I said it's good. Yeah, which means you thought it was crap. Like, if you thought it was good, you'd be doing a weird dance or something. Well, it's a little clinical. You know, I mean, you're writing fiction. It should be emotional. - I know.- But I love you. You know, you're the greatest writer, and you deserve all the awards. -Hey.-Hi. Uh... I'm here to see Hilde. She... She called my... - I don't know. How does she have my cell?-Yeah, she-she's like that. Uh, anyway, she-she's in school. -School?-Yeah, school. She's not a degenerate, Frank. Um... Can I come in? Uh, I... I wanted to say hito your dad anyway. Yeah, yeah. Come on. Come in. -Hi.-Hi. I just wanted to say hi to Syl. Hey, Syl? How ya doing, buddy? I heard you're running for sheriff. So why aren't you at workwith Briggs Senior? 'Cause I, for one, would love to knowwhy he tried to dispose of vital evidence. Well, he must've had his reasons. Thought it was the right thing. Look, he's a good man. Yeah, good mendon't frame innocent people, Frank. Cool, um, glad I stopped by. You apologize to Sam yetfor lying at his trial? Wow. She really doesn't let youget away with much, huh? Yeah, it's the... it's the worst best thing about her. I knew Hilde got it from you. I didn't think she got it from both sides. Well, uh, I'm gonna go. If I wanted to get my ass handed to me, I'd be hanging out with my own dad. Uh, hey, Frank. Look, uh... make amendswhile you have time, huh? Look, you might not get another chance. If Sam gives you that chance, you should take it. Listen to his side of the story. I'm going to see him. You should... You should come with me. Why aren't you happier about this? We have a witnesswho says the sheriff destroyed evidence. Every time I feel hope... You can't say thingsif you're not gonna deliver. -I can't take it.-Sam. Your case brought me back into the law. I am in this with you, and I promisel will never blow smoke up your ass. So what do you say? Okay. Okay. So we move for a retrial. Sorry to interrupt. Sam. I gotta take you back to Northfield. - Isn't Trip driving me?-No, I'm taking you. Something came up. It's okay. Sam, uh... There's something you should knowbefore we head out. What do you have to say in responseto the allegations against you? Look, I love my daughter with all my heart. Kathryn is a very special girl. She's the light of my life. But she's not a very reliable witness. And what would you say to those who might question the integrityof the investigation? Excuse me. Reporting live from Erie Harbor. Good morning. Just the lady I was hoping to see. The workers found Penny's ashesbeneath that tree and word is you put them there. Small town. Where I come from, that's called hearsay. Ah. Well, here in Washington State, we call that improper disposal of remains. And it's a misdemeanor. A thousand dollars? Unless there was someone else with youthat I should be writing up. No. Just me. Thought you were playing hooky today. No, I'm driving Sam. I thought maybewe could catch up on old times. Come on. -Hey.-Kid killer! - Watch it. Back up.- Rot in hell, you asshole. - Back up.-Sam, I'll be in touch, okay? Come on. Come on. Sam, do you believe the claimsagainst Sheriff Briggs? Kid killer! Did you look in his eyes? - Any comment?-Settle down! - You feel like a man now?- Any comment? - Any comment?- Excuse me. - Sheriff Briggs denies the allegations.-He killed him! That's enough. - How do you feel about that?-Can you get out of the way, please? - Sam, any comment?-I see you. - Sam?- I'll find you. Go on. Said your piece. We interviewed eight peoplefrom the original case file. No new leads. You have no messages. Did Mayor Fife call? Uh-uh. I left him three messages. You're the next interview on my list. Yeah, well, I spent a lot of yearsgoing over my memories so I'm probably a dead end. I found no info on Richie's mom. Except for she divorced Mayor Fife. Well, let's see. After the funeral, she... well, she became a shut-in. And a few months after that, she left, and then the mayor remarried, like, a year later. Sounds suspicious. What? Her leaving or him remarrying? Both. Hey, look. You know, on my beatl, uh, I saw a lot of grief. But, uh, but losing a child? That's gotta be, like, the worst one. You know, grief, it's-it's not linear. You know, it's messy. You know, some people need to be alone, some people can't be alone. Dad? Please don't tell meto stop investigating. Hey, no, I won't. I won't. You know, my dad made that mistakewith me. I'm not gonna do that. What do you doif a source doesn't answer your call? Well, I stop trying to appealto the head and the heart, and I focus on the stomach. Hey, Lucy. - -Hey, Matt. Hey. Come on in, guys. Okay. Why did you let them in? We brought you some ice cream. Our friends workat the Waterside Creamery. We thought maybe food would help. I have nothing to say to you two. We just want the truth... for Richie. We know the truth. Just because you don't want to believea thing doesn't mean it's not true. Yeah, well, just because it lets you sleepat night, it doesn't mean that it is. Mayor, we need your help. Please. Dad. Look, um... I... I understandhow hard this must be for you. No, really, you know... You managed to move on'cause of one small blessing and... and that's that the kidnapper... got caught. But what if he didn't get caught? I mean, what if he is still out there? You know, and Sam got locked awayfor something that he didn't do... well, then your life comes tumbling down. We're not gonna stopuntil we find the guy, you know, the right guy. Yeah, we're looking at the case new. We're gonna follow every lead, we're gonnaannoy the crap out of every single person until we get to the truth. Look, you have to at least believe that. I'm not giving up. I never did. Now my daughter, she won't either. Dad, if it's all been a lie, then it's... it's not closure. Be careful what you wish for. You okay? Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay. What are all these? Well, you wanted leads. That's a few hundred of them. After the official investigation ended, Richie's mother set up a tip line. We had so many calls. All day, all night. It was torture. But she was drowning. She needed more. -More what?-More hope. More Richie. After she left, I, uh, had it disconnected. Thank you. Thanks. We're gonna need backup. Can I have your phone? Department of Motor Vehicles. Yes, hi, hi. I need you, um, to pull a filefor case number... -Please hold.-No, no, no, no, no. I cannot hold again, okay? 'Cause I have been on hold for an hourand I have kids, and I can't afford to dieon this phone call. - -You've gotta be kidding me! Legal services for Sam Gillis? - Hey, Mom?-Yeah? -You okay?-I'm great. No, I'm actually... great. What's up? Um... - Well, you know how the dance is tonight?-Mm-hmm. -It's an '80s theme so I was just... Stop. Stop it right now. The '80s is my Super Bowl. It's the last time I was cool. -Come on.-Oh, no. I saw Richie at a gas station. I saw Richie in a field. Richie's with the angels now. He's in a better place. Maybe Richie hated you so muchhe ran away. Anyone got anything good? This guy saidRichie ran off to the circus. So, no. We should listen to itat three-times speed. Yeah, you can't really do thatwith a Walkman. - H... how did you live back then?- We should probably get going now if wewant to make it to the '80s dance, right? I'm not going to that stupid dance. Whoa, whoa, Hilde. Come on. Hey, you... you don't wanna go? Um... Lucy made me come to askif you wanted lemonade. Who's this? Sam Gillis didn't killRichie Fife. And I can prove it. Eh, that's Fernando. He was a psychic. This whole stack of tapes is labeledwith his name. Hours and hours. Well, Richie's mom was desperate. That huckster sold her hopeat 25 bucks an hour. What's a "huckster"? It's like a phony, or a fraud, something like that. Yeah, it's not worth your time. But he's the only one so farthat said Sam was innocent. Maybe he knows something. He's the only lead we've got. You don't look cool, you look insane. - That was cool.- Oh, this is good. Mom, it's an '80s dance, not an ugly dance. You need to embrace the ugly. No. So, Ethan? Is he the same guy that ditched youin the woods that one time? -Yes, but we're good now.-Oh. And I really, really, really don't wanna talk about it. Okay, cool, cool, cool. But if you ever do want to talkabout anything ever... Okay, Mom. Okay. Cool. Why are we here, Frankie? It's Frank. I borrowed the case file. The day that Richie was taken, I saw you here around 10:00. I want you to walk me throughthe rest of your day. Don't skip anything. Where should I start? You were talking to Richie whenwe came in. What did you guys talk about? We were making plansto meet up later that day, watch Back to the Future. My lawyer didn't think that would playwell for the jury, so I didn't say it. Hey, Richie. - Hey.- Hey! How's it going? Good. What should we play? - Oh, let's play Vindicators.- Yeah. Why'd you hang outwith an 11-year-old boy? Richie seemed like he needed a friend. He had friends. I was more like an older brother. There was something sad about him. He didn't tell us you guys made plans. He knew I loved that movie. Built a dumb fake flux capacitor. The whole time travel thing... With the right equipment, driving at exactly 88 miles an hour... I wanted to escape like that. I think he did too. I rented the VHS again. But he never came back to watch it. He ditched me. - Oh, no, you're being hijacked.- Stop it. Stop it. -Oh, no. Oh, look out.-Stop it. Oh. Game over. -High score's still mine.-Probably. So after that you said thatyou bought some marijuana off a friend, ended your shift, and left. That the whole story? Where'd you go next? The road on the north side of the lake. I wish we could go back in time. To see if you're telling the truth. -Hey, Mom?-Yeah? How did you know that Dad was... right for you? Well, you knowhe cultivated me as a source. Well, we were at our third meeting, and I had this really bad painin my stomach, and he... didn't even know me, but he drove me to the ER. And ten hours later I woke upwithout an appendix... and he was still there. That why you gave up your life so Dadcould write his book in the boonies? Actually, that was... my idea. Maybe not my best, but we had no other choices, so... Ooh. This is it. Mom, it's enormous. - Yes, exactly. Wear it off one shoulder.- Oh. The '80s must have been super weird. Yeah, but we didn't know thatwhen we were inside of them, you know? - Come on. Let's try it on.- It'll be totally tubular. - No, don't do that. Please.- Okay, I'll stop. Hi, Matt and Bridget. It's Kim Collins. Um, a few chaperones just dropped out, and I was wonderingif you might be able to fill in tonight. I know it's crazy last minute, but I couldsend my mom over to babysit Ginny. Um, just let me know. Okay, thanks. -No.-I think so. -Mom, no.-Yes. -Mom, no.-Come on! - Mom, you can't.-I promise I won't even look at you. - I just... I won't.-Mom, stop. No. This is my actual nightmare. It'll be fun! Yeah, for you. Um... Hello? Is anyone here? Back here. Hi, are you Fernando, the psychic? Yes, Hilde Lisko. How does he know my name? Oh, I know a lot more than that. Don't worry aboutbeing unpopular at school. It worked out for me. Matt... it seems your father's quite the arsonist. It's in your paper. Oh, right. Except for the unpopular thing. That was an educated guess. You two have really been stirring the pot. Finally exciting around here again. So, you wanna talk about Richie Fife? How'd you know Sam didn't kidnap him? Richie told me so. -When?-I asked his spirit. Hey, you don't have totake my word for it. You can ask him yourself. Dad, is he crazy? Yeah, you know what? I think, uh... I think he might be, yeah. I've seen that before, that jacket... - That was awesome.- That was nice. You've gotta see Eddy about that. Hey. Where did you get that? Richie's mom gave it to mewhen the cops were done. So I can channel him. Did the cops ever test that for DNA? No. No, they didn't have thataround here back then. All right, listen to me. How much do you want for that? I can't sell it. I need it for my séances. It's still a big drawwith a lot of my clients. We need to hurry. Richie only comes to mebefore the hour of his death. I was parked right over there. You said you were hereduring the abduction. On the side of the road, alone, for hours. I gotta be honest. That's the worst alibi I've ever heard. I didn't know I was gonna need an alibiwhen I told them. They checked for security cameras. Yeah, they thought there weren't camerasat the overpass either. So, Richie didn't show for the movie, and you drove here. Why? Didn't have much else to do. Didn't want to go home. After my dad died... it wasn't a great place to hang out. A witness saw your van speed by hereright after Richie got abducted. Yeah. I was going back to the future. Your flux capacitor was just a toy. It was stupid. I was a kid. And very high. I wanted to go back. See my dad. -So, what happened?-What do you think? Nothing. Is there any chance you saw another vanthat could've had Richie in it? Could have. I don't know. I certainly don't remember now. So, then what? I went back to my house. We have come here todayseeking answers from a departed friend. Richie Fife, please come to us. - Matty? -Oh, come on. Jeez, is that you? You're as old as dirt. Shit, is that your kid? Dad, ask him a question. Okay. Um... Uh, w-what is your favorite band? We doing an ID check? Fine. AC/DC. All right, that's easy. Everybody loved AC/DC back then. All right. Uh... What was the name of the girlyou were crushing on before you died? Dude, stop being such a douche. All right, you know what? I'm not doing this. Kim Collins. Ask him another question. All right. What was the prize that I wonat the arcade that day? There was something thatyou told me to get with my tickets. What was it? The first time we've talked in 30 yearsand this is all you wanna know? All right, then. Who killed you? Maybe you shouldn't be asking who... but why. Yeah, this is a waste of time. Matty, wait! Uh, thank you. Bye! Hey! Give that back! Hilde! Get down! Get down! Get down. Hey! Get back here! Okay, I know stealing's bad, but we could test this for DNA. Yeah, but it won't be admissible in court. It might give us a clue. We'll give it back when we're done. Come here. Come here. Come here. Ah. Hey, you know what? You did good, Scout. You did good! Where can we get the test done? Look, I'll figure that out. You know, but you... You got a big dance to go to tonight. Come on, Dad! This could crack the case wide open! I know, and it will. But not tonight. You're a great writer, Hilde. You know, but really great writers, they need great stories. And in order to get a great story, you gotta... you gotta actually live. That make sense? All right. Put it there. Come on. Let's go. Earth to Ethan. Wow, you... you look awesome. Or rad, I guess. You too. You look... shiny. -Yeah, thanks.-Yeah. -You wanna dance?-Yeah, sure. Am I the only parent who dressed up? Should I be humiliated? I... No, screw them! We look amazing. We do. Thank you for having my back. We'll find a new place for her. A better place. Somewhere worthy of her. Look at her. Did she bring her dad? Oh, my God. Hey, you know it's okay to be scared. These things are terrifying. But you know what? You are the scariest of them all. I promise. Hilde! Check it out! Go on. Go on. Go tear it up. Come on, go. Look! I'm selling themfor ten bucks a pop. -What are you doing?-Merchandising. My dad helped. He has his own screen printing business. So we won't be beholden to sponsorsfor cash flow. Hey, guys. I'll take one. Women's medium. Coming right up! Ah, Purple Rain. Nice, Mr. Witherspoon. Thank you, Principal Collins. In the words of Bowie, "Let's dance"! Um... Guys, uh, I'll watch the T-shirts. They'll be fine. Uh, yeah. I'll stay here. Come on. We'll be right back! The most important part about dancingis confidence. You know how people say, "Dance like nobody's watching"? -Yeah.-Well, I dance like everyone is. You look amazing. - Aw.-Yeah, you do, you do. You look amazing. Oh, my God. No, no. Come on. Let's go. I'd kill to see you in a turtleneckand acid-washed jeans. -Oh, yeah?-Mmm. - Yeah, I bet you would.- I'm... I'm glad you came tonight. - Yeah, me too.- There. Hey, I'm sorry about Penny. You need a second? I came right here after the highway. Probably 11:00. All right! Yeah! I was wondering about that. Hey, Penny. She eat anything? What about you? I'll make you something. Don't say anything. When they start asking questions... just say you wanna talk to a lawyer. Did your dadreally crash that plane on purpose? My dad wasn't crazy. He was a good man. Sam, we need everyone. Richie Fife is gone. Good for him. Then I went to the search party... saw you there. And that's that. "Much suspected by me... Nothing proved can be." Queen Elizabeth I wrote thaton a window with her diamond ring when she was under house arrest. Sam, I'm... I'm sorryfor what I said in court that day. I believe you had nothing to dowith Richie. Pity you weren't on the jury. Frank, get your ass out here. Oh, shit. It's my dad. Um... All right, come on. Wrist. I believe you. Doesn't mean I trust you. You know, I think we can getRichie's jacket tested pretty quickly. You know, if Sam's DNA's not on it, I mean, that's... that's huge. You know, it's, it's, it's huge! - What? What?- -Nothing.-What? Just, I haven't seen you this excited... in a long time. It's so... It's nice. I know. Maybe this should be your book. - What do you mean?-Richie's story. Your story. I... I'd read that. -Yeah. I... Come on. I don't know how that ends. It's Trip. Hey, Trip. Hey, so I spoke to my DMV contact. The record for Sam's vanhas been expunged. That's suspicious. Yep, but she did find a sales slipfrom when Sam bought the van. The model doesn't match the vanin the security footage. Oh, my God. I'll keep digging. Okay, thanks. Maybe you will. Will what? Have an ending. You okay? We can... We can get out of here. No, I'm good. Hey, you want some? Oh, my gosh. You're doing drugs? Vaping can kill you. Great, it's the little narc. Iz, my parents can't find out about this. Look, Hilde, I'm begging you, okay? Just walk away. Please don't write about this. You're gonna ruin my life. I'll make sure she doesn't say anything. You know, it is an '80s dance. So what should we do? Jessica. Come on. -A wedgie into a trash can?-Stop. - Maybe an old-fashioned swirly.-Jessica, come on! Ooh! Girl fight. Girl fight. Girl fight. You bitch! Izzy, stop! Just let it go. Yeah! Yo, girl fight! Hilde, run! You're dead at this school! Get back here! Ooh! I am gonna ruin your life! Come on. I think we lost them. Oh, my gosh, Iz. You were so cool. I hate you. You ruin everything, okay? Every time I start buildingsomething good up for myself, you just pop up like a little whack-a-moleand smash it to pieces. Please. Please just stay out of my life. God, I wish you'd just disappear. I checked the GPS on your car. You're supposed to bring him right back. He's got a 48-hour furlough. He's still got a few hoursbefore he's due. Well, what the hell are you doing here? It's none of your damn business. And so what's your goal? Huh? Set Sam free? No matter what you find, he is never getting out. I will make certain of that. He's a murderer, maybe a pedophile too. Do your damn job. You're a dirty cop. You lied to the whole town. - Come on.-To me, to everyone, for all these years. Yeah, Sam is a good man. He's an honest man. And you used me. Yeah, you used me to put him away. How do you know? You got proof? We got the right guy, and we did what we had to doto close the case. Get that animal back to prison. Now! Before he tries to take another kid. Hey, girls. Izzy? Izzy. Matt, hey, she's over here. Hey! -Hey, are you okay?-I'm fine. What happened? Are you hurt? No. What... Where's... Where's Hilde? God, who cares? I hope she's gone forever. Izzy! Oh, my God. Izzy! Iz, come o... Come on. Wait up. He's gone. Sam? Sam! Sam! Sam! Sam! Oh, don't do this. Don't do this. Sam! I saw Richie at a gas station. - I saw Richie in a field.- Richie's gone. I saw Richie by the lake, but he was older. And he looked taller. He's never coming back.
