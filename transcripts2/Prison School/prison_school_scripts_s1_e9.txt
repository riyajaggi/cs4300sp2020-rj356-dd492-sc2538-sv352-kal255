 "Prison School" "Final Episode" The winner here... ...is us. All I hear is the whining of a sore loser. It can't be... Who the hell are you?! Let me go... Madam Vice President. It can't be. Joe? Then who are you? Chiyo-san? What are you doing here, Chiyo? Where is the Dirty Four-eyes? Where did he go? He'll appear soon enough. And when he does, the Underground Student Council will be finished! --Get in here! --Get in! We caught an intruder! --Stop struggling! --Stay still! Morokuzu Takehito hath arrived! Dirty Four-eyes! Stop trying to be cool, you perv! --Get off! --Enough! You two. Return to your class... ...room. Okay! Chiyo, what is the meaning of this? Why were you in the prison? Chiyo! Answer me! Last night, I got in through the jailer's office and hid in the bathroom. What? You couldn't have done that. I locked it! No, it was unlocked. It was a three-way trade! After Chiyo-dono infiltrated the office through the rear... I need to use the bathroom! Me, too. Joe-dono and I took our leave to pee together. We arrived at the bathroom, where Chiyo-dono awaited. Chiyo-dono. Forgive us for troubling you. No problem. Chiyo-dono took Joe-dono's clothing, as the hood could easily hide her face. Joe-dono took my clothing and glasses. And I took Chiyo-dono's clothing. Thus, the three-way trade was completed. But... ...why are you in your underwear? A pants-shitting wretch such as I would never dare to sully the pants of Chiyo-dono. Don't tell me... The wound on your forehead was also... Indeed! I injured my forehead and wrapped it in bandages to better disguise Joe-dono. Are you sure about this? Yes. Stab me as hard-- Blood! Mr. Chairman. We hereby submit a complaint against the Underground Student Council. The Underground Student Council set us up for expulsion! Joe's ants getting attacked by that crow... Andre's jailbreak... And Shingo missing curfew... The Underground Student Council arranged it all. It was their "DTO." Danshi Taigaku Operation! Enough of your wild accusations! There's no proof. Because the plan for the DTO on your computer, and the email you sent about it... ...were already deleted. Is that right? We weren't just playing hide-and-seek with you yesterday, you know. What if someone recovered the data from the computer in the jailer's office? You couldn't have done that. When I went around to check, the jailer's office was locked up tight! The door can be locked from the inside. But when I looked inside, there was nobody there. By then, I had already taken my leave. After the three-way trade, I entered the jailer's office, which Chiyo-dono had left open. After recovering the deleted evidence, I went out through the back door, and hid there 'til morning. By the time you and the Vice President came by, our plan was already complete. He's bluffing! It was only ten minutes from the time Hana contacted us until we arrived at the prison! He couldn't have recovered the data in such a short time! I had downloaded and hidden the recovery software on the jailer's office computer in advance. In advance? Go! While the Vice President was engaged in arm wrestling, I infiltrated the jailer's office, downloaded, and hid the recovery software. Last night, recovering the data and taking my leave took less than ten minutes. But then, where is this data you speak... ...of? Gakuto. Please take it. The five of us... Although we were born and raised in different places... ...we united our hearts... ...overcame trials and tribulations... ...and at last obtained it. This is our soul! This soul of men! I accept it sober... ...ly. Indeed. The behavior of the boys completely matches the plan written... ...here. This is... ...my fault. What? Kiyoshi. The one who unlocked the back door for Chiyo-chan... It was you, right? Yes. I did it then. I got you off guard... ...and unlocked the door. Got me off guard? Was that it? You did that... ...just to distract me? It was all... ...just to trick me? I'm sorry. Kiyoshi, you shithead! Kiyoshi-kun! --Kiyoshi! --Stop it, Hana! --Kiyoshi! Let me go! You bastard! Piece of shit! Damn you! I'll kill you! Stop this! Damn you! Kiyoshi, you shithead! Damn you! Damn you! No! Madam President! Enough. It isn't your fault. Hana and Meiko... I forced them to go along with my plan. Then you accept that the Underground Student Council... That you were behind this. Is that how I should take... ...this? I am truly sorry. This is all my fault. Sis... Acknowledged. Gentlemen. You were originally sent to prison for the crime of peeping on the girls' bath. But... I have decided to remand your sentence... ...to time served. As of this moment, you are all free... ...men. And so, we regained our freedom. I will bring this up at tomorrow's staff meeting. There will likely be punishment... ...assigned. That is... ...all. I'm sorry. I was too careless. No, if I hadn't been provoked into arm wrestling with them... The two of you did very well. I must apologize to you both for getting you caught up in this. No... that's not... Sis! It's all right now. Food tastes best when you're a free man! You pick what you want, and you eat it! This is true freedom indeed! By the way, your wrist still ain't healed? Like it'd heal in three days. But Hana-dono's actions were truly fearsome. That it was not broken is the one silver lining. Oh, please... This is nothing. This much punishment... ...is less than I deserve. Are you okay, Kiyoshi-kun? Chiyo-chan! I was so worried. Huh? Here. Say "ah!" It's hard to eat like that, right? Y-Yeah, but... C'mon. Say "ah!" O-Okay... Is it good? Kiyoshi's changed, huh? There's a glimmer in his eye that wasn't there before prison. What's wrong? Jealous? Anzu... C'mon. I'll do it for you. Say "ah!" Cut it out, dumbass! I ain't some invalid. And who made sure you got out of there, huh? You owe me. You're gonna shove my kindness back in my face? Well, I just... C'mon. "Ah." Is it good? Shingo-dono, as well... You eat that much? What a big mouth! You eat too much! Thank you! I'm sorry! --Let's make him lose weight! --He's so cute! More! Harder! Cowards, the lot of you! Being a man means being battle-ready at all times! --Do not let your guard down after a victory! --Hey, guys! You want some cupcakes? --Do not let your guard down after a victory! A-Are you talking to us? Hi! We're the Home Ec Club! Cupcakes for you! Hey, that's Totally Accurate Three Kingdoms! Can I see? So cool! This is anarchy... Hey! Hey, look at this! "Wet T-Shirt Contests Notification of Unequivocal Abolishment" Wet T-shirt contests... ...unequivocally... abolished?! No! But why? Foolishness! We must oppose this decision with all of our might! "May 18th, 2015 By Student Council Agreement" By the way, what's the student council? There's an Underground Student Council, so there must be a regular student council. We had acquired our freedom. We could eat what we wanted. Thank you! Spend time with girls... Thank you! And even leave school whenever we wanted. You're looking good, Kiyotake. Oh, yeah? You having fun too, Egawa? Me? I'm doing... okay. We could do whatever we wanted with our time. And yet... Begin! I'm definitely a Shiranui girl, I guess. Kiyoshi, do you prefer Unryu? Oh... Unryu, huh? I wouldn't call myself a fan, especially. But he is a good wrestler. I was talking about entrance procession styles. Huh? Kiyoshi-kun... do you really like sumo? O-Of course I do! Hey, it's starting! Go for it! Go! By the way, how are the president and the others? Oh, I heard they're under house arrest in their rooms. I see. They won't be expelled for this, right? Are you worried? Oh, nah. Indeed... What you say is... ...correct. I accept your judgment... ...as the student council. This blows. Abolishing the wet T-shirt contest is such a bummer. Stealing away our most anticipated event... This student council can be up to no good! Madam President! Madam President... What do we have to look forward to now? Isn't there any way to reinstate it? Just give it up. With the Underground Student Council's loss of standing, there's nothing we can do. But then how are we supposed to get to see-through heaven? Yeah... --Hurry! --Wait up! C'mon! Hurry! Everyone's going to see! What's this? What a shameful man am... ...I. Th-This is... The Underground Student Council is being punished? No way! This is anarchy!
