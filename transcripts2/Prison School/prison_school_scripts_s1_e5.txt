 Excuse me... Kiyoshi-kun? Chiyo-chan? You're here, aren't you? I'm moving the curtain, okay? What should I do?! Huh? He's not here... Don't you move. Not one millimeter. And don't you dare make a sound. Where did he go?

 Yes? Pardon the intrusion. I've come to get your approval for my prison code reform proposal. About that... Your proposal is too stri-- The reforms take into account their rather poor influence... ...upon the other students. Excuse me. Hello. This is the chairman's office. Yes. What? I keep telling you, you don't have to plant the sponge gourd. You hear me? I don't like sponge go-- This is why I loathe men. Clearly, we need to escalate the Danshi Taigaku Operation. I just can't shake the feeling that something awful happened back there. Since the next thing I knew, I was asleep under the bed. Hey, where is Shingo? It feels like I set Joe up. So? If you're gonna make me do stuff like that, I'm out. I wanted to ask you about some math stuff. The crow's after your ants! You dirty crow! What would the other prisoners think, I wonder... ...if they knew you alone were eating delicious food and spying for us? You don't seem to understand the position you're in! Ow! I'm giving you permission to leave the facility for two hours. Buy us some root beer and kaki peanuts. God damn it! You really suck. Huh? You're one of our boys, right? What are you doing here? I see bra! Sh-Shut up. Hey, don't go all red 'cause you saw a little boob. Huh? I wasn't looking! Show some respect, okay? I'm a grade higher than you. Anzu! Let's hit the picture booth! Coming! I'm up for a match any time, Kohai-kun. Anzu... Guan Yu-sama! Such a shameful man yours truly is... A coward who takes the figures, but avoids all blame... Tell me, what is yours truly to do, Guan Yu-sama?! Gotta get changed... What's this thing? By using kaki peanuts as breading, one can create deliciously crispy deep-fries with almost no seasoning. Oh, hot! Again, it's too dangerous to do it dressed that way! Well? Do you have anything new to report? Depending on your answer, I might let you go out again tomorrow. Oh, yeah. Here! What's this? I don't know, but it was on the floor in the bathroom. You gave me something that came off a bathroom floor?! These are... ...high-quality kaki peanuts, made from the finest glutinous rice. Brilliantly discerned, as always, Madam President. So good! What is this? Oh no! When I threw it at him, it got mixed in... That thing that was on a bathroom floor... But I can't tell her that! This looks like a falchion. Falchion? Put simply, a Chinese sword. After class, yours truly has a Three Kingdoms society meet-- Not here today, huh? Gimme a bite! Wow, that chocolate's great. She's so close! I can feel her boob, even! So good! She's seriously licking the place I was licking. I can lick it too, right? She won't call me a creep, right? Oh, hey. You wanna go see this with me? What's wrong, Gakuto? Yours truly's falchion has gone missing. Huh? Form a line! The president is pleased with your recent work, and has deigned to offer you a reward. Hands out! It's high-quality kaki peanuts, made using glutinous rice from Uonuma. We're graciously allowing you to have some. Oh, I do beg your pardon. That belongs to him. Isn't that right, Dirty Four-eyes? Is this yours? It's Guan Yu, a character from the Three Kingdoms. You're a Three Kingdoms fan. I'm sure you've heard of him. Is this yours? Verily, yours truly admires Guan Yu. But I am not into figures. Liar! I've learned that this is a limited edition product, sold only in Akihabara on May 7th. That's the day that Kiyoshi broke out. You helped him break out so he'd buy this figure for you, right? Gakuto-kun... You helped him break out? If you admit he's yours, I'll give him back. Don't do it, Gakuto. Don't admit it. If you admit it's yours, it's like admitting you helped me break out! I knoweth not what thou speakest of. Really? In that case, why don't I take a little ride with Guan Yu-dono? Stop it! Don't you know what Gakuto went through to get them? He cut his beloved long hair. He shit his pants in front of girls. He sacrificed his high school life to get those figures! How do you like that? Quite a comfortable ride, isn't it? Maybe I'll start putting my weight into it. How's that? If the vice president puts any more weight on it... ...the figures will break! Red Hare! It's okay, Gakuto. Save Guan Yu. If you don't... I will! Madam President. As you can see, Dirty Four-eyes has admitted to helping with the break-out. It's okay, Gakuto. This is for the best. Yours truly has no interest in such toys. I wish to return to my work. I shall take my lone peanut. Gakuto. 'Twas for the best. But... Kiyoshi-dono! I truly apologize for everything. The others bullied you... ...and I looked the other way. Idiot. You don't have a single thing... ...to apologize to me for. I apologize profusely! Please, punish this incompetent fool! Hana... Yes, ma'am! Th-This is... Madam... Vice President? I can see neither her tits nor her panties! Who left a shovel sticking out of the ground? It was me! Let me lick your boots to apologize! Put it away at once. Please, Mom! I mean, Madam Vice President! Please punish me! Today, you'll be repairing the barricade. Your glasses are crooked, Dirty Four-eyes! Why? May 22nd. Clear weather. I haven't gotten the whip in over a week. "One Week Later" I haven't gotten the whip in over a week. I haven't gotten the whip in over a week. I'm reaching my limit. Please abuse me. Please insult me. I don't understand. Why, when all the others get punished... As predicted. The best way to break Andre is to withhold punishment. DTO. Danshi Taigaku Operation. Let us move it to the final stage. Yes ma'am! Okay! Damn. It's too tight. I can't breathe! As a reward for bringing the slave diary, the president is permitting you to leave the facility again. Thank you, ma'am! Be back by 6:30 for dinner. Punishment... Punishment... Andre. It's time for punishment, Andre. M-Madam Vice President! Please, punish me! O-Oh no... Andre! "My Slave Diary" "My Slave Diary" My diary... What's my diary doing here? "I opened the door, and there was the vice president." "She gave me all the punishments!" This is... My future diary? I opened the door... Andre! Mom! I mean, Madam Vice President! Who are you calling your mom?! It's really you, Madam Vice President! Please, punish me! It looks like you need a lot of punishment! You damn pig! Come... ...closer! Andre! You must desist! Come closer! Andre! --You damn pig! --Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Yes, that's a breakout! This was rigged to break. They tricked him. I see it went very well. The bursting of the too-tight uniform would arouse the mentally worn Andre enough to make him to break out of prison. All went exactly as planned. Indeed, Madam President. Brilliant, as always. Now... ...all that remains is to wait for the dog's return. That movie blew. I fell asleep, like, half an hour in. Half an hour? That's too soon. Th-This is so fun! She's so close. Can it be... It's okay for me to kiss her? 35 minutes left, huh? I'd waste precious time if I went back now. I should take time to enjoy this kiss. Traitor! How dare you betray us! --Stop it! --Liar! --We'll never forgive you! --What's all this? Hey, be careful. You're gonna push him down the steps. But he ditched us to play with some girl! So what? He's your friend, so forgive him. He's our friend, so we can't forgive him. Dummy. When someone's your friend, you forgive 'em. --Shut up, dummy. --Shut up, dummy. Friends are important. Don't betray them, okay? When someone's your friend, you forgive them. Friends are important. You really can't betray them, huh? I'm sorry. Huh? I also... ...betrayed you, Shingo. Hey, where is Shingo? I asked Shingo to pick up some things in town. I've told him to return by 6:30. Oh... it's 6:23. I did tell him that if he was even one second late, I would count it as a breakout. Don't tell me... The president told me to get close to you. If I did, she'd recommend me for a place on next year's Underground Student Council. W-Wait a minute. What do you mean? I'm a spy for the Underground Student Council's DTO. "DTO"? What's that? The Underground Student Council wanted me to keep you busy, so they could expel all the boys. Expel?! Hurry, okay? You don't have much time. Your watch. While you were sleeping, I set it back 30 minutes. Kiyoshi and Andre makes two breakouts. And if Shingo isn't back by 6:30, that will count for the third breakout, and you will all be expelled. We played right into their hands, huh? It's over, huh? Too bad. This summer, we were going to take a class trip to the beach... ...and have a wet T-shirt contest. Wet T-shirts? So cold! Through the T-shirt, as it clings to her bare skin, one can see the hill of the nipple and the valley of the navel... A truly erotic situation! I believe... Shingo will return.... ...and bring the wet T-shirt contest with him! --This is so much fun! --Don't pour that on me! What's with you idiots? We believe in wet T-shirts... No! We believe in our friend! Fifteen seconds left. Now, everyone. Let us unite our hearts! Wet T-shirt contest!!! Shingo! Shingo, hurry! They're gonna hold a wet T-shirt contest! The wettest of T-shirts shall they be! Eight. Seven. It'll be see-through heaven! Wet T-shirts! See-through! Six. Five. Four. Three. Yes! What's wrong? Damn it! It won't open! No, Shingo! That door... Two. One. Zero. Your time is over. But it wouldn't open! It was poorly hinged, so they fixed it to be a sliding door. A sliding door... That's the third breakout. Thus, you are all, hereby... ...expelled. Hair... on his nipple? "Nipple Hair... on his nipple? "Nipple Hair" Hair... on his nipple? Go! Andre! "Fight, Andre!!" Go! Andre! "Fight, Andre!!" Andre! "Who will be #1 in the school!?" "Who will be #1 in the school!?" Why is it so long? "Seize victory!!" "Seize victory!!" Fight, Madam Vice President! Fight, Madam Vice President! The nipple hair... is shaking? "Even the president is..." The nipple hair... is shaking? "...shaken." The nipple hair... is shaking? Prison School... ...is streaming, so you won't miss an episode!
