 This is you, isn't it? Did you have fun... ...at the sumo match? Kiyoshi-dono... Why do you have that picture? You really have some nerve. You tried to seduce my dear little sister? Little sister? Chiyo-chan is... But... I'm glad I found out

 before you could corrupt her much. What's with them? Did you piss her off somehow? Madam President! I found human hair in Kiyoshi's bag. Human hair? These cuticles... You... You used Dirty Four-eyes's hair?! Hey, man, don't tell me... Yeah, looks like it. Madam President. This uniform... It's your sister's. "Chiyo" "Chiyo" Bastard... Kiyoshi!

 You dressed as a woman to escape, didn't you? And you used my sister's uniform! Yes, ma'am. What? Does that mean we all get an extra month in here? You're kidding me. You... ...make me sick. All of you, back to prison! Kiyoshi. You will be informed of your punishment in due time. Kiyoshi-dono, forgive me, but didst thou get my figures? I fought valiantly and even pooped my pants. Do not say thou fail'st to buy them! I got them. I hid them in the supply closet. Kiyoshi-dono. I should ne'er have doubted thee! Hey. You broke out for a date with some damn chick? You selfish son of a bitch! Well, why don't you say something, huh?! I'm sorry. We're way past "sorry"! Shingo-kun! Let's go back. You don't just screw people over like that! Let's go, Shingo. Kiyoshi, you're a real shitlord. "I got a good picture, so I'm sending it to you. Look closely at his nose and cheek." Buddha... ...save me! "Prison School" "Prison School" "Episode 4" Get in! You're spending the day in solitary confinement. Breaking out is bad enough, but to actually lay a hand on the president's sister... You won't get away with this! Chiyo-chan... I... I can't stay here any longer. Chiyo? You're there, right? Chiyo... Let me be alone for a while, Sis. I'll come back later. I will now issue your punishment for yesterday. Kiyoshi, you stand accused. You dressed as a woman to break out of here, didn't you? Yes, ma'am. Did you act alone? Yes. I did it all by myself. What about the wig you made from Dirty Four-eyes's hair? I took the hair you shaved off and made the wig myself. The prisoners share responsibility in break-outs. Therefore... ...the rest of you get an additional month's sentence for Kiyoshi's actions. This isn't gonna stand. Kiyoshi. Your crimes include... ...breaking out, theft, and indecent sexual contact. Your punishment for all this... ...is expulsion. Didn't think he'd get expelled. It was pretty shocking. Tyranny! The Underground Student Council can have no such authority! Let us take this matter to the school! Why are you all fired up? Huh? Shingo-dono, has he not been your companion since middle school? What kind of friend are you?! If we're so tight, then why didn't Kiyoshi tell us he was breaking out? Man's got a point. You know... ...you've been defending Kiyoshi an awful lot. You guys aren't just friends, are you? Oh? The soap... 'Tis invigorating! Of what dost thou speak? Don't tell me... You helped him, didn't you? An absurd accusation! Is it really? Madam President! I sympathize with your desire to expel Kiyoshi, but to decide it without a full staff meeting... That won't be an issue, Madam Vice President. Th-This is... But will he really sign it? Normally, he wouldn't. Therefore... I will force his hand. I'm so hungry! I really admire that about you, Chiyo. You were as pale as a zombie yesterday, but one good night's sleep later, and you want tonkatsu. I feel like it was partly my fault, too. I was so shocked he had my uniform, I just decided he had to be a deviant. But he probably had a good reason for it. Oh, yeah. Chiyo... you haven't heard? What? Heard what? Kiyoshi... He's being expelled for breaking out. What? Excuse me. I've brought Kiyoshi. Sit right there. Please write your name here. "Withdrawal Request" Please write your name here. "Withdrawal Request" "Withdrawal Request" "Withdrawal Request"? You want me to drop out? I would never... Don't speak until you're spoken to. Yes, ma'am. You know, this is partly for your own sake. My sake? Rumors that you stole and wore a girl's uniform will spread like wildfire. You'll be treated like a pervert for the next three years. What? You'd be better off signing it. Take the easy way out. Now, quickly. Sign it. "Withdrawal Request" Sis! What's this about Kiyoshi being expelled? Chiyo... Chiyo-chan! Don't make him sign that! Listen, I'm the one who invited him to watch sumo! Kiyoshi-kun broke out to keep his promise to me! Chiyo-chan... I didn't realize that was your uniform. No fast talk, you pig! Don't do it, Meiko-chan! Don't do it, Meiko-chan! Don't do it, Meiko-chan! Her breasts! I'm directly experiencing the sensation of Chiyo-chan's breasts! Sis. I'm complicit in this. If you're going to expel Kiyoshi, you'd better expel me, too. Don't be ridiculous! Kiyoshi, get away from Chiyo this instant! I'm serious! I'll sign it right now! Chiyo-chan! Stop! Chiyo-san, you mustn't! Why are you being so stubborn over this deviant, Chiyo? Kiyoshi's not like that! He likes sumo, and he's nice! It's out of the question. Kiyoshi, sign this right now! I... ...will not sign it. What? No matter what hardship awaits me in my school life in the future, I swear to straighten up and fly right from now on. So... ...I won't drop out! What did you say? See? He admits that what he did was wrong! Fine. Return Kiyoshi to prison. I'm grateful, ma'am. I've been encouraged. By Chiyo-chan's kindness, by the feeling of her boobs, by the sweet smell of her boobs, and their softness. If I have the chance to experience them once again... Then my reasons for leaving this place... ...no longer exist! This is Watanabe. This is Kiyotake and Egawa. When you take your ants out for a walk, you'll see they have personalities, too. Wow. You can keep ants as pets? You're amazing, Joe-kun. Truly impressive. Guys. There was really no excuse for what I did. I'm sorry! W-We are just glad thou wert not expelled. Gakuto! How about you work with me in the storehouse today? What? You coming or not, Gakuto? Yes... Hey. The guys really seem to hate you. Hana-san... I... I have to clean the bathroom. But you made so much trouble for them when you escaped, who could blame them for excluding you? Why are you ignoring me? That's so rude. You're treating me like a dirty rag! And after I came back and everything. I didn't mean it that way. Hey... You didn't forget what you did to me, did you? What? I'm not a monster, so I won't do anything worse than what you did to me. So I'm going to ask you... I'm... ...not dirty, am I? Not at all! Obviously, you're not even slightly dirty. Really? I'm going to make you prove that. I will see all those boys expelled. But Madam President... Underground Student Council code specifies three break-out attempts before expulsion. We'll find their weaknesses, and force them to cause problems one after another. If we make it clear to the school how dangerous they are, not even the chairman will stop us. I call it: Danshi Taigaku Operation. "Boy Expulsion Operation" I call it: Danshi Taigaku Operation. Code name: Operation: DTO. Yes, ma'am. Operation: DTO... But "Operation" is redundant, given the "O" in "DTO"... Should I point that out to her? If that's what you're doing, I've got some good news. Hana? Shingo's trying to get the group to ostracize Kiyoshi. A rupture in their solidarity? This could be to our advantage. Let us begin it at once. Danshi Taigaku Operation! Also known as... Operation: DTO! There it is again. "Operation: Danshi Taigaku Operation"... Should I correct her, after all? No... Surely she'll realize it before one such as I could even attempt to correct her. Madam President! "Operation operation" is all redundant. Brilliantly noticed, Hana. I was testing you to see how closely you were paying attention. Meiko still has a ways to go. Y-Yes, ma'am. You know what your first job will be... ...don't you? "Shingo Wakamoto" Too bad about Kiyoshi getting your term extended, huh? Yeah. Has anything changed with any of you? Even something that seems very trivial. Is that what you called me here to ask? There's nothing really special. I mean, we're all... It's hot! Are you okay?! It's dangerous to do it dressed that way. Don't you want to eat it? It's A5 wagyu. Now that I think about it, Joe's started keeping ants. He cares about them. Ants? Oh-ho... One time the container they were in fell over, and he started going crazy... I see. He loves his ants that much? Okay. You may eat. Gladly! Well? Delicious, isn't it? Watanabe and Kiyotake seem to be getting along. Egawa, too. Hey. Step on them and you're dead. I'd never do that. Yeah, well. You never know with a traitor. Joe. Could I talk to you? It'll just be a second. I was in the middle of my walk. Oh, really, Madam Vice President! It's unusual for those three to be here at this time of day. The crows, too... I wanted to ask you about some math stuff. Math stuff? Hey! Stop it! Joe! The crow's after your ants! What?! Stop it, you dirty crow! Stop that! That's one of the president's crows! Get out of my way! My ants... You bastard! My ants... Assaulting the Underground Student Council over a few little ants? This is a serious problem. Take him to solitary. Yes, ma'am. "A few little ants"?! Your damn crow started it! Don't do it, Joe! You'll pay! Don't do it! Are you okay? What has transpired?! Kiyoshi. I... Don't worry. We're in this together, right? That's... That is... That's a stick up his ass! Kiyoshi-dono! What is that? It went right in! Wow, look at it! It's right in there! Kiyoshi-kun? Joe. Using a dangerous weapon... Madam Vice President! You're wrong. It's a misunderstanding. I stuck it in myself when I fell. I'm sorry for causing so much trouble! Bowing with a stick up his ass... Such admirable fortitude... ...from trash like Kiyoshi. Madam President! I'm taking Kiyoshi to the nurse's office! Hana-san! I'm fine! I can't let a prisoner go by himself. Damn. Give me back my ants! Your bravado won't last long. Out of the way! You're going to sit here and think about what you did. God dammit! Did you get the stick out? Y-Yes! Put on some ointment and you'll be fine. Thanks. Is it okay to use these without the nurse here? It's fine! I... I'm not done yet! Close that thing! No! I'm going to get you back for what you did to me! What?! First, you're going to p... ...in front of me! I'll take a picture as a memento! I can't do that! No way! Your face is all clenched up! Do it with a smile and a peace-sign! It's not happening! I knew you'd say that! Fine. Face that way. We'll start with the main event. I'll go first, and splatter it all over you! What?! Now, lie down! I'll bathe you in the same humiliation that I myself felt. After all... ...I'm not dirty, am I? But if you do it here... the bed will get all wet... You think I care?! Now... ...I'm going to do it. You'd better not look. If you do, I'll kill you. Here it comes! Huh?! Is she seriously gonna do it? Excuse me... Kiyoshi-kun? Are you here? Chiyo-chan? I wonder if he's resting on the bed. Kiyoshi-kun? Not good. If Chiyo-chan sees us like this... With me and Hana-san both naked from the waist down... You're here, aren't you? I'm moving the curtain, okay? What should I do?! Touching boobs... "Shingo's thing..." Touching boobs... "Andre's doodle..." "Andre's doodle..." My future diary? A comfortable ride, isn't it? "Gakuto's you-know-what..." A comfortable ride, isn't it? "The story... "The story... ...and her boobs..." "The story... ...and her boobs..." Dammit. "...cannot be contained!" Dammit. "...cannot be contained!" It's too tight! I think you need punishment! "Coming up is the next... episode!" The original album CD by our theme song singer, GOOD ON THE REAL... ...and the single CD by HaKU, who sings our opening theme... ...will be given out randomly to ten lucky viewers!
