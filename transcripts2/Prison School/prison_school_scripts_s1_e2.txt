 The five of you will be spending one month in this prison. While here, you will follow the Underground Student Council's orders to the letter. Don't even think of doing anything stupid like trying to escape. If one of you does escape, it will prolong the others' sentences by one month. A month's captivity is a violation of our human rights! What he said. All we did was try to peep on the girls' bath. We're really sorry, too. At least let us talk to the teachers-- Request denied. This prison is our school's traditional student correction program.

 We have the teachers' full permission. School-approved imprisonment? My parents! I request a phone call to my parents! You've got it. Does that mean you'll be telling them yourselves? That you got caught peeping. Either one is fine with me. Be expelled... ...or stay here willingly for one month.

 A barricade? What nonsense is this? After class, yours truly has a Three Kingdoms society meet-- Try not to do anything too foolish. Anything you do from now on will require my permission. Gkh... You get it, don't you? The slightest disobedience from any of you will result in similar discipline. Any objections? No, ma'am! Then get to work already! Yes, ma'am! One, two... You got it? Careful. Chiyo-chan... I bet... you really hate me now, huh? I want to say I'm sorry, face to face... Ow... Who said you could get a drink? Are you absolutely incapable of learning? I'm sorry! I forgot to ask permission! If you can't understand a verbal correction... ...I'll have to get more physical. This has gone way too far! Shh! Calm down, Kiyoshi-kun. I didn't tell you to take a break! Get back to work! Hey, you. Take off your hood and let me see your face. I can't do that. What was that? Don't you realize you're being rude? It's the one thing I can't do. What was that? H-He never removes his hood. It's from an early childhood trauma... Bitch. You think I care about your trauma, scum?! Joe-kun! Are you okay? Andre. Don't. I'm a big guy. I can take it. A show of friendship, eh? I could vomit. Hey, pig. You made me dirty my shoes. You're going to lick them clean. If you do it, I'll let him keep his hood. If you can't do it, you'll be punished. Andre... Andre... Andre-dono... That's enough. Whatever he's done, this is too far. Why, you... It's okay, Kiyoshi-kun. I'll lick them. It's not okay! Tell me why he needs to lick your boots. Work is over for the day! Are you guys okay? You all got it pretty good today, huh? But I'll do my part tomorrow. Kiyoshi-kun. Hey, now. You don't have to thank me. It's the least I could do for a friend. Starting tomorrow... How about you don't talk to me while I'm working? Huh? Why? Kiyoshi. Same goes for me. And yours truly, as well. Me, too. What's with you guys? What did I do wrong? Andre... Don't tell me you liked that. Yeah, I hated it! I hated not getting to lick the vice president's boots! Why did you stop me?! I was just seconds away from licking them! Yeah! I understand! I understand so well! I wanted to lick them, too! You guys... Are you serious? We could ask the same of you! What kind of man feels no pleasure from torment at the hands of such a beautiful woman?! Yours truly has never seen a woman's leg and panties in such close proximity before! And she smelled so damn good, Gakuto! Her spit tasted so good! I got to call her a bitch! I wanted to lick her boots so much! Bitch... These guys... ...are sick. Say it! Madam Vice President! Madam Vice President! Louder! I'm done for. Kiyoshi! What happened to all that bravado from yesterday? Or so I thought... But this is actually pretty damn good! Madam Vice President! Do not punish him so! Punish me instead! Madam Vice President! I'll take one for the team! I'll lick your boots! The vice president's methods appear to be backfiring. This tea is so good! Hana. Would you join her? Oh, yes, Madam President. I'll handle everything. Now, we'll be moving on to the next job. But first, allow me to introduce the Underground Student Council secretary, Midorikawa Hana. Hi there! I'm gonna be helping the vice president watch over you guys! Her cuteness has not lessened! I wanna lick her shoes, too! Now, move out! Today, we're gonna look for four-leaf clovers, all together! Yes, ma'am. The clovers you pick will be made into bookmarks and sold to raise funds for charity. So work hard, okay? Hana-san's nice, huh? She's the Underground Student Council's conscience. Seeking the clovers that bring you good fortune... You like her that much? She's like a kid. No sex appeal. What's all this? Got your clovers yet? Yeah, yeah, we're doing it. "Yeah, yeah"? I think you mean, "Yes, ma'am!" By the way, Hana placed fourth at the Inter-High School Karate Championship. Ossu! Hey. How many four-leaf clovers did you find? Can I see? Y-Yes, ma'am! Oh? Not very many... And why do I see three-leaf ones there? You think you can fool me, huh?! This punishment is less enjoyable than the vice president's! She's too serious about it. There's no erotic tension at all! And she's wearing track pants, so there's no joy to be found in her acts or her looks! I miss the vice president's discipline... ...and her panty shots! I hear the boys are in prison. Don't you think you're being a bit hard on them... ...Madam President? They were involved in an incident that would typically result in expulsion. It's not inappropriate. Everyone was against gender integration in the first place. You forced the matter, and-- Now, now. Traditions are important, but so is the occasional reform... Don't you think? But we're already having problems because of it. I know. I would never attempt to justify their actions. But I hope you'll cut them a little slack. According to prison rules, they're supposed to get free time on weekends. You are aware of the rules... ...aren't you? Perfectly aware... ...Father. Without the vice president's discipline, the work is hard, with no relief. I forgot to mention... Good behavior will result in three hours' free time outside on the weekends. Madam President! Do you speak the truth?! Yes! Yes! Yes! Are you satisfied with that? Yes! Chiyo-chan... I really should apologize for peeping. Chiyo-chan! Wait! Kiyoshi-kun! Um... I... Apologize, man! It's now or never! Kiyoshi-kun... you weren't peeping, were you? Uh... Right. I knew it! I'm so glad. I lied again! I'm total scum. If you're in prison for a month, then I guess... you won't make it to sumo on Saturday, huh? Good behavior will result in three hours' free time outside on the weekends. I can go! The sumo date... Someone's coming! I'd better go, okay? Ch-Chiyo-chan! I-I'll make it to sumo! I promise I'll make it happen! Oh, hell. Is she looking for me? Oh, darn it. I won't make it to the main building. Jeez... I drank too much dandelion tea. No way. Are you kidding me?! No! What's wrong? What happened? Did he attack you? No, um, actually... No! Don't say it! You again, scum? No... I swear... Enough! Work is over for the day! Back to prison, all of you! Truly incredible, Kiyoshi-dono! To reduce the tyrant Hana to tears! No, I didn't... You know how to get things done, huh? Truly, thou art a man among men! Excuse me. "Proposed Revision of Rules" Th-This is... "Ass Jobs" "Ass Jobs" This is why I say... ...all men are scum. Huh? No breaks on the weekend? That's right. Given the delay in work today, I have decided that you'll have to work over the weekend to maintain schedule. Madam President... That's not what you prom-- Stay away from the president! I promised Chiyo-chan that I would go. I can't give up now! No... I won't give up! Madam President, I will wash you. Please do, Madam Vice President. Are you certain about disobeying the chairman? It won't be a problem. Their behavior has been far from good. And the chairman is not always right about everything. Am I wrong? Y-Yes ma'am. You're right. The thought of releasing those peeping monsters after just one month... It simply doesn't feel right to me. Line up, everyone! "7:00 AM Wake-Up" --Sound off! --One! --Two! --Three! --Four... --Five! "7:30 Breakfast" "7:30 Breakfast" After ten days in prison, "7:30 Breakfast" you grow strangely accustomed to things. "8:30 AM 1st Period" "8:30 AM 1st Period" I eat... "8:30 AM 1st Period" ...then study. --Then after class, clearing the wilderness. --One, two! One, two! One, two! Just as I'm told. And all of this is... ...to see my promise through. Madam Vice President. May I go dispose of the trash? Yes, you may. Yes, ma'am! Chiyo-chan! Sumo! Meet me May 7th at 1:00 PM at the taxi stop at the station's north entrance. You can make it on Saturday, right? If I want Chiyo-chan and my freedom... ...I have to get out of here! I only get three minutes each time, but this wall's been weakened by age and humidity. If I work at it every day, then by Saturday... Where do you think you're going? Yours truly was just taking a piss! Don't think you can fool me just because I've been gone a few days. Hey, you. The dump's that way. Oh, sorry. I also had to take a piss... Permission granted. I said, "Permission granted!" I think... I'll go to the bathroom, after all. Oh crap, she's following me! I see right through you. You told the others about it and you all make fun of me, right? Of course not! Then you do it, too. Right here. While I watch. N-No way! You saw mine, after all. It's not fair unless you show me yours. That's crazy! Whip it out already. H-Hey, stop! Please stop! H-Hey, wait! Not good. Now I kind of want to do it! What do I do? Don't push down there! Go on! Whip it out! Stop struggling! N-No! Please let me go! I can't hold it! What?! What happened? What on in the world... Madam Vice President... I... I got all dirty... That was close! What disturbs you, Kiyoshi-dono? Has something transpired? No, nothing. May 7th? A sumo wrestling tournament? And digging a hole as well? No... Kiyoshi-dono. Art thou attempting to escape? If we cannot get it, I shall make it. "In honor of our comrade in battle, Gakuto" If we cannot get it, I shall make it. "In honor of our comrade in battle, Gakuto" No matter how I search for "poop mp3," there are no hits! You fool! "We will never forget your valiant service" "We will never forget your valiant service" Gakuto... I will make it out of here! Gakuto... I will make it out of here! "Thank you, Gakuto." Gakuto... I will make it out of here! Kiyoshi-dono... Forgive me. Ossu! The Underground Student Council has an announcement! We're giving a full set of the original Prison School comics to ten lucky viewers. The president has decided it. All the details are right here! Read them and reconsider your life choices. OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
