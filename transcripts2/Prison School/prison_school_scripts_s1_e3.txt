 Art thou imitating the films of Hollywood? Then I shall assist. Huh? Yours truly... ...shall help you escape, Kiyoshi-dono. "Ass Jobs" Did Mari see this? "South American Educational Facilities: Their Policies and Challenges" That means... ...I must bid you all... ...a very final goodbye. As an educator... As a father... No...

 As a man, I must draw a... ...line! "Prison School" "Prison School" "Episode 3" Kiyoshi-dono. Knowest thou of The Three Kingdoms? Yeah. Never read it myself, though. This May 7th, after an eternity's waiting, the quadrennial Three Kingdoms Figure Festival shall take place in Akihabara. Yours truly must obtain its limited edition figure set of Guan Yu Yungcheng and Red Hare. Huh? You want me to buy it for you? Indeed! That's the stupidest reason I ever... Stupid, you say?! The event is once every four yea-- I get it! Just keep your voice down! Huh? Shingo-kun, you'd better shower. They're locking up in ten minutes. You gotta be kiddin' me. Nobody said anything. Picking so slowly at a hole will never see it opened by Saturday. Yours truly has concocted a plan. A plan? Apologies. The soap... it proves difficult to retrieve. My shoulders are so stiff. Where's that soap... What the hell did I just see? On Saturday, the second-years hold a mock exam. Kiyoshi-dono, you shall use the entrance. The entrance...? Hey. Are you okay? Such pain! This is... These guys are hardcore... Crap! They saw me! Sh-Shingo! Thou must join us immediately! N-No... Better hurry. There's not much time left. 'Tis invigorating! These guys... they're like predators! Not good. Was he... ...eavesdropping upon us? I think I'll... pass this time. So what's this about the entrance? Kiyoshi-dono, you shall become a woman and exit freely, through the front entrance! A woman? No way! It's true! --Really? --Really! Why would you say that? It's true! To her math teacher? --Yeah. --So bad! She's in trouble now. Tomorrow after class... ...thou shalt take a girl's uniform from the laundry room. Before the laundry man collects the hampers... Sir! Yo! Yo! Didst thou just laugh in yours truly's face?! Come forth and fight me! --Hey, yo! Yo! Come and fight me, posthaste! --You starting something, kid? Okay! First, the laundry room! Are the uniforms already in the truck? These are... ...the vice president's... "Vice President's name: Shiraki Meiko" Hey! Hey! Yo! Yo! I shall bring the pain upon thee! Hey! H-Hey! You should value your life more highly. Hurry... Got it! Kids these days... Not good. I'm trapped! Trouble afoot! I must rescue Kiyoshi-dono! The indomitable warrior! Guan-sama, grant me your power! What the hell? Are you okay? In that moment, the spirit of Guan-sama entered my body. I got the uniform. Now, the only question is how to keep the Underground Student Council from realizing I'm gone? Yours truly was once known as the craftiest general in all of Nerima. Have no fear. "Keep Out" "Keep Out" The hell? You gotta be kiddin' me. On the day of the jailbreak, Kiyoshi-dono, we shall say that thou art occupied in the bathroom with diarrhea. But that'll only cover for about an hour, right? Indeed. In all likelihood, the vice president will check to confirm your condition. Thus, during tomorrow's computer class, I shall download an mp3 of poop noises. If I play it through a speaker placed in the stall in advance... ...you can make it sound like I'm straining? Inconceivable! What is it? Despite my thorough search for poop mp3s, I cannot find one worth using. Are you really searching? I have found some, but they are unconvincing! What are we gonna do? This is our only chance! Yours truly... ...thought that at an all-girls academy, a girlfriend might be within my reach. What? These earbuds can act as microphones, too. You... You're not saying... If I cannot find it, I shall make it. You fool... Are you going to give up on your youth?! I have made up my mind. To wait three years is better than to wait four. Those Three Kingdoms figures come but once every four years. Don't do it! Kiyoshi-dono... Forgive me. Gakuto... I will make it out of here! A high school student, shitting his pants? Is your asshole that loose?! He's getting verbal abuse! It's loose 'cause of Kiyoshi's dick. C-Cut that out. Get up, Dirty Four-eyes! I-I beg your forgive-- Ow! You piece of shit! I told you to get up! --I beg your forgiveness! --Ow! Enough! Get away from me, you sweaty pig. What are you doing? Are you okay? It will require but one more push. Madam Vice President-dono! Yours truly begs thy utmost forgiveness! Stay back! What are you doing? Garbage...! You bastard! --That hurts! It hurts! No! --You Dirty Four-eyes! The prisoners appear to have grown rebellious of late. Have you failed to supervise them correctly? Th-They have grown accustomed to the harshness of prison life. They have the vitality of cockroaches. I don't want to hear excuses. Yes, ma'am. If they're the cause of one more scandal... ...you know what will happen to you. Don't you? Yes, ma'am. You think Gakuto's okay? What kind of discipline do you think he's getting? Are you ready? Beep! Beep! Beep! Whoa! Gakuto. Hey... What happened to your hair? To signify my deep regret, the vice president shaved my head. But that hair meant so much to you. Wow! You got shaving play? I am grateful it was so well-done. It looks better now, anyway. Andre, do me next. Gakuto. Are you okay? What? Open it. Gross! Do not call it gross! That is a wig yours truly went to great lengths to create! A wig? You mean, you pissed off the vice president just to get this? 'Tis nothing. If it gets me those Three Kingdoms figures, I will gladly shave my head a time or two. I'll, like, totally make it out of here! Chiyo-chan. I swear, I'll break out of here successfully. "Day of Jailbreak" Be certain to return by 5:00. Got it. Be victorious. Wait for me, Chiyo-chan. I'm coming to the place where you're waiting. I don't see Kiyoshi here. Kiyoshi-dono has shown signs of poor digestion all day. He has taken leave to the bathroom. Go tell him to keep it brief. So I shall. Isabel of Brazil. Your cute hips... I'll never forget them. Chairman? Farewell, Isabel. What's he doing here? Farewell, Evita. Farewell, Claudia! Great! Nobody noticed me! I can do this. I can do this! Smile! Just ten meters left! Excuse me. Exactly... ...what is with... ...your bag? The president! I was one step away from freedom! I'm sorry. You were just trying to hide the rip in your jacket. I'm sorry for embarrassing you. I'll grant special dispensation for today. As you were. I made it out! Chiyo-chan! Sorry for the wait! Farewell, my beloved asses! Father. What are you doing there? I wished to fill in that... ...hole. Hole? Places! Go for it! Go! Go for it! Yeah! That's great! Go for it! Kiyoshi-kun! Kiyoshi-kun! Come on! Okay, pose! It came out really well! You want a copy? Oh, you've got rice on your face. I'm so glad to be alive. What's wrong? I got something in my eye. I'm gonna run to the bathroom. Okay! There. I'll send one to my family, too. Excuse me. I see... Oh no! Oh, I got his bag wet. Oh no... "Chiyo" This is... ...my uniform? Sorry, the bathroom was really far away. It's not like that, Chiyo-chan. It's... You make me sick. Ch-Chiyo-chan! Is Kiyoshi still in the bathroom? Y-Yes. He's been away from his post for too long. I shall check on him. No. I'll give him the warning myself. These boys have the loosest assholes I've ever heard of! Hey, Kiyoshi! How long are you going to neglect your post? Can you hear me, Kiyoshi? If you won't come out, I'm coming in! Answering with a shit? What's the matter with you?! Return to your post at once! Yes! O-Oh no! No! Fifteen minutes yet remain before Kiyoshi-dono's return! Get out of there, Kiyoshi! No response, eh? In that case... I'll do this! I'm sorry. I just felt so sick... If you're there, you can at least answer me! Return to your post at once. Yes, ma'am. That was you just now... ...wasn't it? Madam President! This is you, isn't it? Did you have fun... ...at the sumo match? It's time to initiate Danshi Taigaku Operation: Codename DTO. "The sweat will pour" Danshi Taigaku Operation: Codename DTO. Danshi Taigaku Operation: Codename DTO. How can you be so selfish?! "The tears will flow" How can you be so selfish?! How can you be so selfish?! "And they will..." "And they will..." I'll go first. "And they will..." ...splatter it all over! "...splatter all over!!" ...splatter it all over! "Watch their passion!!" "Watch their passion!!" She really wants to do it? She really wants to do it? Here it comes! Be grateful! Prison School DVDs have a street date. They're full of special features and making-of videos.
