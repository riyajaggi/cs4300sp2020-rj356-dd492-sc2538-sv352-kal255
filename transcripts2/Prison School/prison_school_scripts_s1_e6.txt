 "Hachimitsu Academy" "Hachimitsu Academy" Hey, did you hear? The boys tried to break out twice in one day yesterday! For real? Does that make three, then? --Yeah! --Then they're expelled! Expelled? Oh, wow! Kiyoshi-kun... Hey, Chiyo! Where are you going? My boys. It is a pleasure to meet...

 ...you. A pleasure to meet... ...you. I never expected to meet you like... ...this. Hey! What's all this about expulsion? Chiyo-chan! When someone breaks the rules, punishment is only natural. The Underground Student Council set them up somehow, right? Let me go! Why do you have it in for Kiyoshi-kun and the others? I'll bring the matter up at the staff meeting tomorrow. Once the measure is approved, the chairman will stamp the forms,

 and your expulsion will be official. Mr. Chairman... About what time will you be stamping the forms? Well... At the latest, I hope to receive your stamp this weekend. Yes, that's... ...right. That is all. This weekend, we'll all be... ...expelled. Trailers.to: Watch Full HD Movies & TV Shows Premium Platform "Prison School" "Prison School" "Episode 6" Cheers! Hey, the DTO was a big success, huh? That's our president. A true genius of command. At last, we'll have peace and quiet at our school again. Then, insolent as it may be, in celebration of the success of the DTO, I shall provide brief entertainment. Wow! What are you gonna do? Behold, as I perform fifty chin-ups, using only my fingertips. One! Two! Three! Four! Five! Six! Seven! Eight! I'm sorry! After all the crap you gave Kiyoshi about his girl... Furthermore, the woman in question was a kunoichi in the Underground Student Council's employ. Guys. Just beat me until we're even, okay? Kiyoshi-kun, violence won't... Kiyoshi-dono! Now we're even. What? We prisoners are in this together. There's not a man here who would hit you. Kiyoshi... Kiyoshi's right. Shingo-dono, weren't you tricked by the Underground Student Council, too? In this, you are also a victim. You apologized. That's what matters. Thanks, guys. I wonder how Shingo made it back by curfew! Anzu will be here to explain that shortly. I suspect... ...something unforeseen happened. I'm coming in. I owe it to Anzu. I came back because Anzu told me everything. Oh? You have moved past use of honorifics? It ain't what you guys think, okay? All the arm-linking and cheek-pinching was part of her trap. Cheek... pinching? Did this trap have any other parts? Well... She gave me some bra and nipple glimpses... But in the end, she told me the truth. I think we came to an understanding. Shingo. What?! We prisoners are in this together. But... Your crime of getting a n-nipple glimpse... It's too much to forgive. W-W-Wait, y-you guys... So you got attached and told him the truth. You, the captain of the guard... What were you thinking? I'm very sorry. --Think nothing of it. --What? In the end, the DTO was a success. I see no reason to hound you further for your failure. Take your leave. I truly am sorry. Don't close the door. Um, I'm really sorry. Never mind that. Go. You're not gonna scold her at all? She knows about the DTO. We can't have her saying anything foolish before the boys are expelled. It's better to keep her close, where we can watch her. That's our president. Such brilliant foresight... But Madam Vice President, are you okay? I'm fine. I can easily escape this on my own. Keep going, Madam Vice President! Go! Go! We can't just wait for a miracle. The Underground Student Council trapped us. Have you all just given up? Of course we haven't given up. Shingo. That Anzu girl of yours. She said there was a plan to expel us called DTO, right? Now that you mention it, I saw it in the jailer's office. Excuse me. I'd been called to the jailer's office, and I saw it on the email screen. The letters "DTO." If we could get a copy of that email, it would prove the Underground Student Council set us up! But... How do we get into the jailer's office? The vice president has the key, right? Comrades. Do you think yours truly lacks a plan? Gakuto! Yours truly was once known as the craftiest general in all of Nerima. I have a fine plan indeed. Yes! We'll get that email and prove our innocence, no matter what! For the sake of our wet T-shirt contest! Yeah! And most importantly, for my school life with Chiyo-chan... Kiyoshi-kun... Four straight victories! Andre, you're just too damn strong. Andre-dono is truly strongest in the school! You're awfully relaxed, for men about to be expelled. We just finished the staff meeting. The vote to expel you was unanimous. Now we're just waiting for the chairman's stamp. Forget that, Madam Vice President. How about a little arm wrestling? Be not so ridiculous, Shingo-dono. The vice president is a mere woman. That's right. The vice president may be strong, but she can't beat Andre. She's gonna lose. We all know it. You really think... ...I'd lose to that damn pig? I can't ignore that. The vice president will accept the arm wrestling contest. As Sun Tzu says, "In all fighting, the direct method may be used for joining battle, but indirect methods will be needed in order to secure victory." The vice president has considerable confidence in her arm strength. We must use that confidence to lure her into an arm-wrestling competition and steal the key to the jailer's room. I see! While the four of you are challenging her, I shall use the stolen key to enter the jailer's room and retrieve the email data from her computer. So we engage her from the front, but we're actually going behind her back to get what we want? Indeed! Come on, Andre! First... Thou must defeat yours truly. Don't make me laugh. You think you're worthy of challenging me? Such arm strength as I have acquired through daily physical labor... ...thou shalt now behold. Very well. Ready... go! That wasn't even a warm-up. Now, Andre. Come on! Madam Vice President! Please, let me fight you next. Very well. I'll take you on. Madam Vice President. Allow me to take your coat. Don't bother. Now, come on! Ready... Go! It hurts! Get off! Are you unharmed, Madam Vice President? What's wrong with this rotten desk? I'm sorry! For pity's sake... Now... Andre, come on. W-Wait! You haven't finished things with me yet. Don't be a fool. I won decisively. The desk broke. We can't be sure. No matter how many matches we have, the outcome will be the same. A-Are you running away? What was that? Kiyoshi-dono. Your tactics are splendid. Once I have acquired the key, then the race begins. If I enter the jailer's room and the DTO email has been deleted, I must download restoration software and use it to recover our email. How long will that take? Approximately ten minutes. Ten minutes, huh? If each of you can hold out for three minutes, our plan will likely succeed. You aren't refusing a rematch... ...because you're afraid of losing, right? Play on the vice president's pride and buy me time with a second round. Very well. We'll call that round one. Come on. Ten minutes from now... So our time limit is 7:42. Ready... Go! Kiyoshi! --Kiyoshi! --Do it! Go! "Underground Student Council" --Kiyoshi! --Kiyoshi! The wet T-shirt contest... No, my school life with Chiyo-chan is riding on this arm! Even if this arm breaks... ...I will... Oh! That's... Her breasts sway back and forth like the waves in her bra... And it's so close to showing itself! Standing alone on the ocean of the breast... That tiny island of pink... Its name... N... Ni... Nipp... I think it's time to finish this! As I thought. The email has already been deleted. I must download free restoration software. Kiyoshi-kun! You okay? N... Nipple... Who's next? Madam Vice President. I'll face you next. I hope you're not all talk. Don't underestimate me. You might get hurt. I was once known as Dynami-- I don't care. Let's just get started. Wait, listen, I was called-- --Call it! --Yes ma'am! Ready, go! "3 minutes 27 seconds left" "3 minutes 27 seconds left" Three minutes and change? It appears I have more time than expected. "3 minutes 27 seconds left" "3 minutes 50 seconds left" "3 minutes 50 seconds left" Inconceivable! "4 minutes 16 seconds left" Inconceivable! "4 minutes 51 seconds left" "5 minutes 21 seconds left" Now, Andre. Come on. Don't leave me out of the fun... Madam Vice President. I think you'd better sit this one out. I'd say that's my line. You... With just a little bit of hard labor... How can you have such a defined musculature? Better not judge a book by its cover. "2 minutes 10 seconds left" "2 minutes 10 seconds left" Curses! It's proceeding so slowly... My comrades, hold out just a bit longer! Hey, are you okay? My arm just gave out. So it's finally down to you and me. You damn pig! I'm honored. We're counting on you, Andre. Six minutes left. There's a hair... ...on his nipple? If I may. That hair is... ...growing out of his nipple? Why is it so long? Ready... Go! You're amazing, Andre! Break her damn arm! What's wrong, you hairy fat ass? You may indeed be superior to the others... But is that all you've got? Keep it up, Andre! --Go! --Andre! --Come on! --Go! Andre! --Go! --Almost there! The nipple hair... It's swaying! Stop it! To undermine me in this way... It's like a nameless tree standing alone in the desert, its leaves quivering in the wind. To present me with such a hypnotic sight... The two seem evenly matched for now. At this rate, it could take four minutes... No, five minutes! He could hold out that long! Success. Now, to install it and locate the email. Playtime is... ...over, you damn pig! Damn! Every time I press his arm to the table, his nipple hair comes into view and I lose all my power! What? For a minute there, the vice president seemed to lose all her strength... "Install Complete" "Data Restoration Software Re.Boot" "Run Re.Boot" Three minutes remain until the designated time. That's a dirty trick, you damn pig! It's no use. The vice president's verbal abuse is turning him on! Andre's back in business! Where is that email? Two minutes. Please. Endure it, Andre! Hang in there! All the vice president's spit... sweat... and verbal abuse... If I receive any more rewards like that... I'm gonna... I'm gonna... That's right. Why didn't I think of something so simple? If I don't want to look at his nipple hair... I must merely close my eyes! The vice president closed her eyes and puffed out her cheeks! Does she want Andre to kiss her or something? One minute remains. Go, Andre! Andre! Die! I'm finished! You couldn't even beat me in your dreams. With this, I declare myself #1 in the school. The key is missing. Oh no! Gakuto's gonna... Madam Vice President. You dropped the key on the floor. Just stay quiet until this weekend. That was too damn close. We just barely made it, huh? Great work, Andre! You're incredible. You came at the end there, right? Well? So? The email? I could not obtain it. I did manage to install the restoration software... But I heard Andre cry out, so I hurried to return. I'm sorry! You mean... Then... Our high school lives... ...are over. Asses or breasts. "Asses vs. Breasts" Asses or breasts. Which do you... "With the prisoners' fate on the line..." Which do you... "...the ultimate interrogation begins!" Which do you... "...the ultimate interrogation begins!" ...prefer? This man... What is he talking about? "Which do you prefer?" What is he talking about? "Which do you prefer?" "Which do you prefer?" That's right. "Which do you prefer?" It is asses and... "Mr. Chairman..." It is asses and... "Mr. Chairman..." ...breasts. "You are great." ...breasts. Prison School DVDs will go on sale very soon. Perhaps I'll reward those who buy them with punishment.
