 Oh... nothing. You're lying. I think you need some punishment. Those are... ...boobs! I can't focus on the pain, or my escape, because of those bouncing bosoms... This is... Titty Hell!

 Until last year, it was famous as an all-girls school. This year, they got a new chairman, and now it's co-ed. But once I got here, I found out... Hey. Hey, Kiyoshi. ...I was one of only five guys here. I never thought there would be this many. I heard there were lots of girls, but... I mean, that's why I came here too, but 200 girls to one guy is crazy. Silence, wretches! Do you not know how to focus? Focus on what? Looking down shirts and up skirts. Before I came here, I had so many dreams. I thought I'd say goodbye to my virginity in April. Virginity nothing. I ain't even talked to a girl face-to-face yet. What about you guys? Not a one! "Morokuzu Takehito Nickname: Gakuto" Same as the right. "Nezu Jouji Nickname: Joe" Same as the above. "Andou Reiji Nickname: Andre" What the hell. We just suck, don't we? "Wakamoto Shingo Nickname: Shingo" I'm going for it. "Fujino Kiyoshi Nickname: Kiyoshi" I'm going to talk to a girl! No, no! Content yourself with mere voyeurism! He's right! It's not a great idea! Shut up! I want to do more stuff with girls! I'll show you how I live my life. Excuse me! Aw, man. They smell so damn good... Girls sure are nice. This doesn't feel so bad. Have a minute? Yes, Senpai. Do you see now, the futility? Futility? Yours truly has attempted to engage them in earnest dialogue, too. Yet I was left with nothing. Why? Because the women, you see... They really, really hate us! They hate you, because you're a creep. That is untrue! Since the moment we arrived, have you not felt their hatred in the air? Now that you see, focus your attention down-shirts and up-skirts! Senpai! What's wrong? Didn't you guys see the paper they handed out yesterday? About the Underground Student Council? At the very least, don't talk to boys where the crows can see you. Otherwise, you won't survive at this school. "Year 1 Class 1" Oh, damn. I dropped the weird sumo eraser my mom bought for me. Sorry. Sorry. What? S-Sorry. Raiden Tame'emon? Huh? This is the worst. Chiyo-san, the most beautiful girl in the class, saw my eraser! This is why I didn't want sumo stationery, Mom! Excuse me. I'm sorry about before. Do you like sumo wrestling? Huh? Um... well... sumo is... I have the same one. Raiden Tame'emon. I... I love sumo wrestling. Just love it. Where's Kiyoshi? He's late. You think he's with a girl? He's in the bathroom with an upset stomach. Truly, his was the face of a man with diarrhea. We can wait for diarrhea! Yeah! But there's no way, right? Kiyoshi-kun, you're so funny. I'm really not... Can you stay a bit longer? Yeah, sure. I don't have any other plans. I never knew there was another sumo fan so close by. I can't believe it, either! But I'm getting by on stuff I heard from my mom... Actually, there's a student sumo competition coming up. Do you think... ...we could go together? Sorry. I guess that was weird... I'll go! Definitely! Thank you! What was that little pose? I don't know what it meant, b-but it was cute! Chiyo! Aren't you coming? Mayumi! Sorry. I have to go. S-Sure. Bye-bye! Mom, I'm sorry for saying I didn't want sumo stationery. Thanks to you, I might get to have a date with Chiyo-chan! Thank you for bringing me into this world. --How's your diarrhea? --Was it bad? Diarrhea! I-It's fine. Does your stomach still hurt? Kiyoshi-dono. I have a sacred plan that can ease even your diarrhea. We shall proceed, together, to see it. See what? The girls' baths! Peeping?! --Is that allowed? --Of course not! Kiyoshi-dono, have you ever laid eye upon a maiden's bare buttocks? No. Never, but... Don't you wanna see the girls' boobs? W-Well yeah, but... I refuse to die without ever seeing a real naked lady! Joe-kun, you'll catch a cold. Don't overdo it. Tits... and ass... We'll get to see the full set. The full... ...set? The full... ...set?! We'll get to see the full set! The full... set?! We'll get to see the full set! The full... set?! I'm in. So thou, too, art a man! By the way, what's our target? My research has revealed that Year 1, Class 1, contains the greatest number of cute girls. Year 1, Class 1, huh? That's my class! Thank you! That includes... Chiyo-chan? No! I can't let these creeps see her! Well... I don't know... Good. That will be our watchword. Hey, wait... All for one and one for all! Now, to the battlefield! Yeah! H-Hey! Wait! What should I do? I have to stop them... All of you, halt! My comrades. This mission's requirements are cooperation and self-sacrifice. We must be united in our mission, each man willing to give his life for the others. I do want to see that live T&A;, but... By this, I mean... ...death to traitors! Yeah! But... how are we supposed to peep, exactly? O-Oh, hey. There's no way to see anything from here. Kiyoshi-dono. Stay your fears. Huh? We have come prepared! Phone streaming? Yes. We'll lower the phone through the window on a rope, then watch them in the changing room through our phone on the roof. Now, let us charge to heaven together! This is so not good. They're going to see Chiyo-chan, too! Yes! Almost there! Kiyoshi-dono, take care as you act. It is your own cell phone that you hold. Huh? My cell phone?! Thank goodness! There's no one there! It's a miracle! Kiyoshi-dono! What have you done? This is a failure worthy of seppuku! But... hey... As punishment, you must now retrieve it. Me?! Would you rather leave it there to be found?! You son of a bitch! You used my phone without permission! Yours is the only phone that can stream video to mine! Just do it already, Kiyoshi. Damn it! Cell phone... There it is! I got it! Oh! Now come back! What's wrong? Behind you. Huh? Who's there? Ch-Chiyo-chan? Kiyoshi-dono, forgive me! Hey. Is that... Mayumi? Huh? Ow! I bumped into something. I can't see a thing with my contacts out. I keep bumping into things. Come on, let's get in the bath. What? The bath? She can't possibly mean... Are you serious? Chiyo-chan's getting naked? Just a few centimeters behind me... Wait! Something auspicious has begun. I don't know what happened... ...but good job, Kiyoshi! You're a genius! Mayumi... aren't you getting undressed? If we don't hurry, the bath will close. She'll notice something's wrong! What do I do? If doing nothing just makes her suspect me more... Kiyoshi! Why are you disrobing?! It is the woman that we wish to see! Chiyo-chan... please, go to the bath already. Then I can run away. Nothing but a bath towel! Mayumi. Let's go. Go? Where?! You don't mean... To where are you going, Kiyoshi-dono? It cannot be... Are you mounting a suicide attack? Th-This is... ...the full set! Not good. Chiyo-chan's leading me deeper and deeper in... Gakuto. Shingo. Joe. Andre... I'm sorry. I'll be heading off to heaven before you! Feels so good! Are you embarrassed about being seen naked, Mayumi? So am I... Speaking of embarrassed... I found someone who'll go to watch sumo wrestling with me. The truth is... ...he's a boy from my class. It's a little embarrassing, but... I'm really happy. I'm happy, too. Just don't find out. But did you see that notice in the locker room? A week's punishment just for talking to a boy? What even is the Underground Student Council anyway? Punishment? Underground Student Council? What's that? Kiyoshi-dono is a true samurai. We can't let him play the hero all by himself. Yeah! Indeed! We shall join him. In heaven! Wh-What's that? Wh-Who goes there? We witnessed all of your wicked deeds. I'm so sorry about that! We saw everything! What are you going to do to us?! Damn it! Doesn't this feel nice, Mayumi? Chiyo. Sorry I'm late. I had such a hard time finding this... Huh? Mayumi? Then who are you? I'm done for! There's no way to cover this! Hey... Who are you? Is this the end of everything? Peeping! The boys were peeping on us in the bath! No! Peeping?! Ew! Peeping! Come on, Chiyo. Hey, are you... What? Forget it! Let's go! I'm saved! Where is the other one? The other one is... It was just the four of us! What was that? That can't be true. Tell us, and we'll spare your crotch! You heard her! The same goes for the rest of you. Next! Especially you! Thank goodness. Kiyoshi-kun isn't with them. They got them all... Who are those people? They are... ...the Underground Student Council. It's okay. Don't be afraid. Here. Look at this. Underground Student Council guidebook? The perky one is the secretary, Midorikawa Hana. The one with the pointer and glasses is the vice president, Shiraki Meiko. Their primary job is to crack down on fraternization with the opposite sex. They're a bit like a security force. Then who's the president? The twentieth president, also known as the Crowmaster. Mari. You don't mean... It's... ...you? What's that? President! Oh, President! Welcome back! Kiyoshi-dono! That's our president. Men truly are scum. Let's give them a punishment to fit their crime. Kiyoshi-kun! Chiyo-chan... How funny! Excuse me... Will our punishment be expulsion? These outfits... it's almost like we're prisone-- I didn't ask you to speak. You guys! They look so good on you! Come here! Your disgusting crime against the female students here leaves no room for extenuating circumstances. Thus, to you, the accused... I hereby order one month in prison. Huh? That's going too damn far! Just be grateful you weren't expelled. That is all. Get in! What is this place? Are we really supposed to live here for a month? This is almost like... ...a prison school! And so, our brutal battle began. "Don't you want to see?" One! "A school turned into a prison..." "A school turned into a prison..." --Two! --Three! "A school turned into a prison..." --Four... --Five! Try not to do anything too foolish. I got all dirty... "A sacred and alluring world..." I got all dirty... I'm going to break out of this place. "You'd better..." I'm going to break out of this place. See! "see!!" See! Greetings, everyone. You can watch Prison School on the web, too. Watch the bath scene again. The full set!
