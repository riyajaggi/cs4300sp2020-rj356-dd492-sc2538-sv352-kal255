 Our expulsion couldn't be stopped. You know... I actually feel pretty okay about this. We did everything we could, y'know? Yeah. Guess so. These days have been like a dream to me. Moving my bowels in front of a classroom of girls, and shaving my head were misery for yours truly. Yet through these dark times, for the first time in my life,

 I have obtained that which is known as friends... comrades. Dumbass. You don't gotta say that shit out loud, Dirty Four-eyes.

We no longer felt any anger or defiance. Our spirits were completely broken. Except for one of us... Kiyoshi-dono! Whilst mopping the bathroom, one can kill two birds with one stone by taking care of one's business at the same time! His spirit wasn't broken. It was shattered.

 It appears they've completely accepted their expulsion. Yes, ma'am. Tomorrow, at last, we can purge that garbage from our school. Won't that be a relief? Chiyo? Sis. Are you pleased that you're getting your way? What was I to do? If he remained, Kiyoshi would just continue to cause trouble both for you and the school. What do you know about Kiyoshi-kun?! I don't understand you at all, Sis. Chiyo. You still don't understand the nature of male organisms. You're far too trusting. Tomorrow, the chairman will approve the measure, and your expulsion will become official. In a way, tomorrow is your day of execution. Underground Student Council rules permit you one meal of your choosing tonight. Now. Tell me what you want to eat. Well, then... steak? I'll have hamburg steak, I guess. The usual. And you, Dirty Four-eyes? Yours truly desires grasshopper tempura on rice! With extra grasshoppers! Very well. I'll permit it. Um... for my appetizer, a whipping. For the main course, a round of kicks. And for dessert, your fresh spittle. All non-food requests are denied. That is all. Tomorrow's the last day, huh? It's a letter from Chiyo-chan. If you can write a response, leave some bread with a message inside it. "Chiyo-chan Thanks for everything and goodbye" Is Kiyoshi-kun really going to be expelled tomorrow? This is your last supper. Eat it and be grateful. Madam Vice President! What? "Grasshoppers on Rice" This grasshopper tempura looks the most delicious of them all! Hey. No touching! Don't touch my grasshoppers! I shall eat them at once, lest they be stolen! Gross! How could you feed me something so disgusting?! Gakuto! Are you back to normal? Grasshoppers?! Whose sick joke is this? Shut your face! That's all the sympathy you're getting. There's something I need you to write. Your request to leave school. You'll submit it tomorrow. Fill it in once you've finished eating. Hear me? Hey. Do you guys really want to just give up? We have to do something before our expulsion is official, or it's all over. You got some idea for what we can do? We'll write a petition... ...to the chairman. Like our request to leave school. If we tell him we were set up by the Underground Student Council's DTO... Indeed! We might request more time to investigate that email's contents! If we could get a stay of execution... ...then we might still find proof of the DTO! It's a pretty faint hope, though. Shingo. Can we just leave school this way? If nothing else, we have to hold out until the wet T-shirt contest this summer! Wet T-shirts... Nipples shining through wet T-shirts... Don't you want to see them? You bet your ass I do! I can't hear you. I wanna see the hell out of nipples through wet T-shirts! Me, too! Same! Yours truly does, as well! Don't abandon hope until the bitter end. Wet T... Fight! Yeah! Yes? Excuse me. Did I interrupt your work? Just a few minor duties to attend... ...to. Tomorrow is the day you officially expel that garbage. I request that you be prompt. Yes, I under... ...stand. In addition... I do wish you'd stop attending to your "minor duties" on school grounds. It's repulsive. The enemy was behind... ...me! Finished writing, garbage? Yes, ma'am. What is this? It's a petition. I know it's futile, but I want the Chairman to hear our remorse. Please! This is our last request! Even knowing it's futile? Pathetic... Very well. I'll allow it. Thank you! What? I've never seen that expression on the vice president's face. Could it be sorrow at our parting? It's too sad... Seeing the grasshoppers on rice tossed aside like that, after all my hard work to catch them. Madam Vice President... Wipe away your tears. Ne'er shall we forget these days spent in-- You son of a bitch. Don't waste food! A petition? After you wasted all that grasshopper rice? As if I'd do you any favors! There's no hope left for you. So those boys are gonna be expelled today, huh? I guess I won't get my revenge on that jerk, Kiyoshi. But that thing in the nurse's office... I keep thinking something completely unforgivable happened in there... But I just can't remember! What could it be? What? I feel like I'm about to remember something. This is... Ouchies... I dropped it. Kiyoshi!! As expected, you will all be expelled today. Out of the cell, all of you. "Petition" This is inhumane, Madam Vice President! Did you not give him the letter we wrote? This is counter to our agreement! I didn't ask for your opinion. Shut up and walk. Now it's all over. To you, this is truly... ...thirteen steps to the gallows. Any last words? If they have any last words... ...I will hear... ...them. What is the chairman doing here? I tore up their petition! What the hell did you do? Goodness. What an excellent question. Damn you... Kiyoshi-dono. What measure did you take? I used a decoy. Namely, that petition. I wrote my real message on the request to leave school. A truly shrewd measure! What, then, did you write? Well... I received your message. But as an educator, I will not yield to... ...blackmail. Blackmail?! He interpreted it as a blackmail threat? So he really was doing something he shouldn't have been. "I know what you hid behind the school." I can use this as my trump card, and trade it for a stay of expulsion! You misunderstood. It's not blackmail. I thought it was the only way I could get you to listen. Allow me to say, in advance: this will not force me to cancel your expulsion. That wasn't my intention. But we really were set up by the Underground Student Council! This was mentioned to me before. But you don't have any proof, do you? Three days! Give us but three days, and we shall find proof! Then, you want time to find proof. In other words, a stay of expulsion... ...yes? Yes, sir. With just a little more time, I'm sure we can prove our innocence. In that case... Asses or breasts. Which do you... ...prefer? Asses... Or breasts... ...sir? Yes. Asses or breasts... ...boy. What? What is he talking about? Those little brats. What are they talking about? Where the hell is that bastard Kiyoshi?! C-Calm down! It's just me! Where?! Now... Asses or breasts. Which do you prefer? Um... If I must choose, bre-- Gakuto... Everyone... Let me handle this. Kiyoshi... The chairman is testing us. Remember. Back then... What kind of picture did he kiss? It was... I think... Yes! It was... I know! I prefer... ...asses. We are in agree... ...ment. Allow me to teach you my life's motto. There is no such thing as a bad... ...ass man. I got it right. That was his collection of ass pics. Then, you will permit our stay of expulsion? Yeah, it's all about the ass! Asses rock! I wanna get sat on! No. I cannot allow it... ...yet. I cannot yet be certain that you are true ass men. What is it that makes asses superior to breasts, hmm? What is he... ...talking about? I wish to ask one of you the reason for your enthusiastic preference. Kiyoshi-kun, you said that you prefer asses. But why is... ...that? W-Well... What a fool I was. I didn't expect him to push the ass talk this far. I can't do it. I can't think of anything. Because I... --It's so cold! --...actually like breasts better than asses! The softness, the nipples, the fact that they make milk! I can think of so many reasons why breasts are great. But I can't figure out the appeal of the ass! What do I do? This one answer will decide the rest of our lives. Calm down! I'll kill Kiyoshi!! And myself, too!! If this gets out, the Underground Student Council will be disgraced. I have no choice. Forgive me, Hana! Well? What do you like about... ...asses? Wait a minute. I shouldn't need a reason to like them. The mountain climber, when asked why he climbs, just says, "Because the mountain is there." I can just say, "Because the ass is there." "Because the ass is there." If that is your response... I will consider it an evasion of the question. What? All of the times I have asked this question, in places all over the world, that is the answer that disappoints me the most. You're weren't going to say that, were you, Kiyoshi... ...kun? I'm sorry, everyone. Nothing's coming to me. God... Give me strength! Is that... ...an ass? Why is there an ass in the window? No, wait... No! I'm seeing... Breasts! The Vice President's breasts, which look like an ass! Damn it! What are they talking about in there? They look the same. Human evolution... asses and breasts... Asses and breasts... they look the same! Human... Human evolution substituted breasts... ...for asses! Kiyoshi-dono, what are you-- Quiet. Let him continue. Back when humans walked on four legs, what they saw before their eyes... It was... ...the ass. Then, when humans started walking on two legs, their asses stopped protruding before each other. Instead, what they saw... ...were breasts. Women started developing their breasts as a mere ass-substitute. But the original source of life was the ass! Breasts are just a substitute for that! In other words, from the start, breasts were just imitation asses! If you ask me to choose between the original and a copy, I'll choose the original! The curve of the ass! Its form! It's a miracle created by God! And when a girl gets wet, it's all about the ass! Oh, no, don't pour it on my butt! The ass has the demure eroticism of being hidden far from sight! A refined eroticism lacking in the too-obvious breasts! That's enough. It is clear to me now. You are a true... ...ass man. Thank you... It was a great answer. We are kindred... ...spirits. Do you mean... As I told you. There is no such thing as a bad ass man. I will stay your expul... ...sion. Yes! Great job, Kiyoshi! Asses truly are as profound as you say! Yes! What?! A stay of expulsion?! But! The most I can give you... ...is one day. One day?! That is far too short-- If a man is serious, he can figure it out in one... ...day! A stay of expulsion? What is the meaning of this, Mr. Chairman? I see word travels fast, Madam President. You are... ...correct. There is nothing to debate about their expulsion. Madam President, that is not for a student like you, but for me to... ...determine. Well then, if you'll excuse... ...me. Thank you. You really helped us out... ...Madam Vice President. Madam Vice President! Why are the prisoners thanking you? I don't know! You heard what they talked about in prison, didn't you? That's right. Hana... Madam President... For their last day... ...let me oversee them. I won't let those garbage boys... ...get away with anything. I swear it! "Kiyoshi vs. Hana 'Grudge Match'" "Kiyoshi vs. Hana 'Grudge Match'" Get ready. Your eryngii is the one I won't forgive. "The eryngii..." Your eryngii is the one I won't forgive. "Look at Medusa, and become..." Your eryngii is the one I won't forgive. It's gotten hard as a rock. "...hard as a rock" It's gotten hard as a rock. I wasted your precious first kiss! Let's do it. "All there is" I'll show you... "I'll show you" I'll show you... "I'm going stupid!" I'm going stupid! Hello, everyone. Have you reserved your Prison School DVDs yet? For more information, go here. Chiyo... Sis! OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
