 They were given all of today. The chance I have given them... How will they take advantage... ...of it? We have only today! If we do not forge a plan with haste, we stand no chance of victory! Our trump card today shall be... ...an ass sumo challenge! "Ass sumo" is a sexy and violent sport that consists of slamming butts together. The vice president no doubt takes great pride in her hiney. She will surely accept the challenge.

 In that moment, I shall infiltrate the prison office, and download the secret DTO file. She comes! We must provoke the vice principal! One, two... Go! Andre-kun, put your butt into it! Heyas! I brought lunch! One, two! One, two! Andre-kun! C'mon! --I said... I brought lunch! --Don't stop! Come on! Such stinging! I'll be watching you guys today. So don't screw around, and eat your lunch, okay? By the way...

 I remembered everything that happened in the nurse's office. Your eryngii is the one I won't forgive. My... eryngii? I will make you take responsibility... ...before the day ends. "Prison School" "Prison School" "Episode 8" What a feckless woman I am. Betraying the president's trust and having my guard duties stolen by Hana... You're under a misapprehension. Madam President! I swear I will never disappoint you again! Please forgive me! You have never disappointed me. The reason I gave Hana your duties was because I have an important mission for you. An important mission? That human garbage will surely try something tonight. You must stop them, no matter what. Yes, ma'am! I will! You have such an active metabolism. You just never stop sweating. I'm so sorry! We shall execute the plan tonight. Kiyoshi-dono, have you heard word from Chiyo-dono? Yes. She says she'll help us any way we want. "Okay! I'll help you any way you want." She says she'll help us any way we want. I didn't want to get Chiyo-chan involved if I could help it, but... You have my sympathies, but this plan will fail without Chiyo-dono's aid. What about Hana-san, the guard? How are we to enter the jailer's office with Hana-dono as the guard? That is the one riddle I cannot solve. If it's Hana, then... ...I think... ...I can get into the jailer's office. Huh? Because Hana-san... ...has a grudge against me. Hey, can I take that for you? Chiyo! Thanks, as always. Later! "Tonight at 8, come around behind the prison..." After I unlock the door, I'll knock. Then I need you to get into the prison. Sorry to get you involved. I know it's wrong, but if I want to save Kiyoshi-kun, I don't have a choice.. I see. So that's how you're communicating with the boys in prison. Oh, well. Um... Wh-Who are you? I'm Anzu. I'll help you save them from being expelled. What? What do you mean? Okay. Right here, right? Are you sure about this? Yes. Stab me as hard-- That was the worst possible timing! Sorry! Blood! What? Fighting? And not even in the bath... I-It's my fault! We were fighting, and I just popped him one. Please treat him at once! That's nothing. Just lick it or something. W-What do we do? She's leaving! K-Kiyoshi-dono! Is it true, what happened between you and Hana-dono?! Huh? From what I've heard... Do you think that you can save yourself by seducing Hana-dono?! No! You'll get treatment. Out. "Jailer's Office" I finished bandaging him. Really? Well, you stay here. I have some words for you. What about yours truly? You go back. Thanks to Gakuto's quick thinking, we're back on track. The rest is in your hands, Kiyoshi-dono. Be at the prison's back entrance tonight at 8. For the president's sake, I must crush their plans! It's exactly 8:00 PM. So they are planning something. We're finally alone together. U-Um... Kiyoshi... Don't tell me you told the others about what happened. I... I didn't! It's true! U-Um... Wh-What are you planning to do with those? What am I planning to do? It's just that I have... ...a score I can't seem to settle with you. Prepare yourself. I'm going to make this the most terrifying... ...most embarrassing night of your life. D-Don't! Is this the end of my eryngii?! Huh? Here. Use this. Er? Don't "er" me. Use it already. You mean... ...pee? I cut off the top so you wouldn't spill any. So just do it, okay? Very well. Why did you pull down your pants?! What are you, in kindergarten?! I knew it. Hana-san isn't used to this kind of thing. Great. One layer left. Don't back down, Kiyoshi. If I don't do this, everyone's plans... Chiyo-chan's hard work will go to waste! The best defense... is a good offense! Let's do it. I'm going to show you... ...my pee. Wh-What's with him? He's being so bold... It's working. She's totally dumbstruck. That's the door. If I can just unlock that door... ...Chiyo-chan can get in! Now, hold it. I'm about to pee. Why do I have to hold it? Just hold it yourself! I can't. If a man can't put his right hand on his crotch, and his left hand on his hip, he can't pee well. What's wrong with this guy? Trash like Kiyoshi acting so high and mighty... I can't lose to this scumbag... How do you like that, Kiyoshi, you moron? Now we're on even turf. Or rather... The tide has turned. Wh-What is she doing? Wh-Why? Why did you take off your panties? I'm going to splatter mine all over you, duh. This is all about winning the mind game! In that case... I'll press forward! Well... Make me pee. What's the matter? Let's get this over with. If I can just unlock the back door, Chiyo-chan can... Stay back, trash! Don't get cocky! Yes! The first stage of the plan is a success. Th-This is... Oh no. Look away. If I keep looking, my eryngii will... This is almost... like... ...Medusa! Medusa was a female monster from Greek myth who could turn any man who saw her to stone! If I keep looking... ...my eryngii will... Do it. Huh? You want to get it over with, right? So just do it. Um... It's become stone. Stone? Right now... I can't pee. Because it's like stone. It's hard as a rock! Pervert! Why is it hard as a rock?! I'm sorry! But Hana... your Medusa... Have you no shame?! Getting like that at a time like this... You're disgusting! If you won't do it... ...I'll do it to you. Who's there? Chiyo-chan? What are you doing there? Don't try to resist! Come here! Where are you? That's... ...the vice president's voice! Chiyo-dono has been captured! Our plan is finished! Hold it! Hana! I have the intruder! I'm bringing her to you! No, don't! Everything's normal here! After I finally unlocked it! Let me go! Don't struggle! Come with me! It's a misunderstanding, Madam Vice President. Come quietly, Anzu. We're going to the interrogation room. Anzu-san... you intentionally got caught so that it would be easier for me to move. Thank you. What are you looking at?! I'm sorry. Your Medusa was right in front of my eyes... I'm sorry. I didn't mean to... Why do all these embarrassing things have to happen to me? It's always me. Getting peeped on, getting peed on... Getting an eryngii pressed against me... None of that's ever happened to me before. And "Medusa"? Really?! Don't just name my private parts! It wasn't on purpose! You can hit me if you want. I'm sorry. Sorry?! Is that all you have to say?! That hurt a lot more than I expected! What the... What the heck is going on? Why are you laughing? Why did you do that? Kiyoshi, you piece of shit! There's a girl you like, right? W-Well... Take that! I wasted your precious first kiss! How do you know I've never been kissed? Am I wrong? You're a virgin. You've never even held hands. And you like the president's sister, right? You're... ...right. And if you don't like it, I'm going to keep doing it. This is my revenge against you. Spill it, Anzu. What were you doing there? The silent treatment? You leave me no choice. I was hoping not to have to do this, but... You'll feel like speaking soon enough. No... No! Nooo!! I wonder what's going on in there. I just have to wait for the knock from inside, right, Kiyoshi-kun? There's something weird about this. Why is Hana-san all bunched up? Is this what kissing is like? No, it's not. That's right. The kisses I've seen in movies had lip-linking, tongue-twining, and sucking! This is... ...a child's kiss! I bet Hana-san... ...doesn't even know about French kissing! Why is he putting his tongue in my mouth? Let them cut your flesh, so that you may strike bone! Wh-What is this? This sensation... like electricity running through me... What is it? I'll give you my first kiss. In exchange, I will stop our expulsion! For the others, as well! Thank you! Kiyoshi-dono... I cannot even imagine the tribulations you are facing. But do your best! My head... It's spinning round and round... It's pounding... I'm... I'm... I'm going stupid! The knock! That's the signal to go in, right? I won. It was a grueling battle, yet... Chiyo-chan? No way. It's too soon! Not good. So not good! I can't let her see us like this! Gotta at least get her panties back on! No, I don't have time. No. She's going to see me! No! We're not done yet! Oh, sorry! I can still take more! Whatever. I'm going home. Your pants and panties! You forgot them! Kiyoshi-kun... Huh? He's gone... What's this thing? A message from Kiyoshi-kun? Kiyoshi-dono! Get in. The first stage was a success. Just study on your own 'til nappy time. Ma'am! I need to use the bathroom! Me, too. Make it quick. I subjected Anzu to a rigorous interrogation, but she lost consciousness without confessing anything. In that case... ...we can assume Anzu had no connection to them. Yes, ma'am. It's from Hana. "I locked up the prison." "I'm going to bed." But they must have something else planned. Yes. I agree. They're all here. Both doors are locked. I don't believe they could escape. Yes... The boys and the Underground Student Council... Whichever wins, I face a painful deci... ...sion. There's no way left for that garbage to fight us. The prison is impregnable. And tomorrow, their expulsion awaits them. This is... our soul! "The Men's Soul" This is... our soul! Kiyoshi, you...! "The Women's Passion" Kiyoshi, you...! It's all my fault. "A shocking conclusion" "that defies imagination" "that defies imagination" We've won. We've won. Anarchy! "What will they see on the other side?" Anarchy! Next week is the final episode. You trash who haven't seen it all, watch it on the Internet. Do you hear me? Madam President! OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
