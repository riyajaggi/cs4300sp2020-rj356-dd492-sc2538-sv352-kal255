 Previously on Seal Team... Oh, my God. I got in. Got in what? Tisch. Do they have history and math? No. Then it's not a school. Bye. You should go. They'd be lucky to have you. - What, you're staying here now? - Yeah, you know, I'm just trying to focus on the thing that matters most in my life. Being a Navy SEAL. If that's the case, then you got to come out tonight, meet Swanny. Brett Swann? Dude, that guy's a legend, man.

 Why'd you get out? It was just my time. My time to go. Are you feeling distance between yourself and God, Ray? Makes you wonder if he's anywhere at all, hmm? Maybe going through this will bring you closer to him. Or maybe the distance grows, and the only thing left between me and God is space. Look, I don't want to throw our friendship away on a whim. I also don't want to spend the rest of my life wondering "what if." Are-are you saying what I think you're saying? Hey, I got something to say. I got accepted to Officer Candidate School. This was my last mission with you.

 You're gonna make it. Fuselage has got to be close. Havoc Base, this is Bravo 2. We passed Jaguar. Copy Bravo 2. Passing Jaguar. Proceed with caution. Someone climbed out. Means we got a survivor out there. Havoc, this is 1. We got two dead. Looks like we got a survivor left the trail. Bravo 1, you are clear to track down the survivor. Copy that. - Brock. Get a scent. - Yep? Roger that. Check here. Sonny. Clay. Go with him. Roger that. Find 'em. - Find the survivor. - We'll pull security. - J! - Yeah? They already found us. On the ridge. And they're marking the plane with lidar. They're gonna bomb the site. Copy that, Bravo 1. If this is Chinese Special Forces, this will get ugly. Chinese soldier hasn't fired on an American since the Korean War. That might change today. ♪ I was born on a river ♪ ♪ I was born on a boat... ♪ Mr. Quinn? Mm-hmm? About to have a mutiny down there if you don't serve up soon. The tri-tip wants what the tri-tip wants. God, 12 weeks without your barbecue? Yeah. I'm gonna miss it. That's not the only thing you're gonna miss. I'm gonna miss that a little bit, I think. Yeah. Not as much as your barbecue. Yeah? Well, you know, the time's gonna fly by. Don't you worry. So how do you know when it's done? Well, here, give me your hand. When the meat feels like the-the skin between your thumb and "I'm mad at you" finger. See here? Like that. Yeah, touch the meat. It's done. Let's go feed the wolves. Thank God. Sonny Quinn barbecue. It's to die for, you know. Yeah, literally, he almost died for it. Yeah. Never leave your dry rub recipe in a sniper hide. He's not serious, is he? Why? Serious as sin. Yeah, when I had to go back and get it, I had two dozen Jihad Johnnys trying to light me up. You aren't gonna be getting shot at on this deployment, right? Nah, look... Unfortunately, probably not. All right, Uncle Clay, have some mac and cheese. A little trigger happy right now, okay? Everything's gonna be fine. All we're gonna be doing is training some Filipino SEALs. Yeah. Don't worry about it, sweetheart. Philippines is not Afghanistan, not even a little bit. Dirt, dirt, Gucci. You've been in the dirt twice, now you get Gucci. And it's about damn time. What's up? You hear about this cargo ship off the coast of Japan? Yeah, you really need to work on your party chitchat, Ellis. U.S. Navy ship collided with a... a container ship, in the open ocean. Your people think it's a cyber attack? Likely. Publicly it's an accident, but Langley's on it. Keep me in the loop. I'm gonna grab a beer before the boys kill it all. Hey, girl. You leaving? Yeah, they need a nap. You stay. Tired? Mm-hmm. You sure? Yeah, you should see Davis off. I'm fine. Okay. Well, I love you. I will be home soon. You drinking whiskey now? Babe, it's a celebration. What? It's noon. Have some water, Ray. Come on, sweetie. What is going on with him? I don't know. You know, ever since Mexico, something's been up with him. I don't know what it is. I'm worried. He's, uh... I don't know. Keep an eye on him out there, will you? Got his back, always. All right? All right. Be safe. Hey, can I get next over there? All right. Everybody, settle in. Listen up. Listen up! Kill the music. Today, we say our goodbyes - to Davis here. - All right. Something that's never easy to do. Well, speak for yourself. Whoa. Wow. Yeah, man, that's harsh. You know what, I don't know what I'm gonna miss more, your sarcastic asses or saving them. When's the last time you saved my ass? When I saved your ass? Yeah, my ass. Start with the time that I told you that your fly was down right before you met the president, and then let's just go from there. That was on purpose. I remember that. So while we are saddened to be losing her, this is a rebirth for Petty Officer Lisa Davis, an evolution, if you will, of a bright young sailor. Don't move. Uh-oh. So... Wow. Whoa, what is that? Right? Right? Just something to remember us by. What does that say there? It says, "Lisa Davis. Fair winds and following seas." Okay. Wow. I came up with that. Um... Okay, what to say? Uh... You're my family, and I'm leaving. That's life. Everything comes to an end. Leaves fall. Close a book. You say goodbye. It still feels all kinds of wrong to be, you know, leaving the people that taught me so much. Mandy Ellis. Commander Blackburn. You taught me how to hold focus when all is lost. Clay. You showed me what it is to have a dream, and to fight so hard for it that no one can take it from you. Sonny. You showed me what it is to know who you are and where you're from and to be proud of both. And I know that you really try to convince everybody that you're just a redneck... but you're more than that. You're a redneck that can cook. That's right. And Ray Perry. You taught me what integrity is, and that faith is sometimes the best guide. And Bravo 1. You showed me what real leaders do. They make the hard decisions and they live with them. To not doubt, only decide. And I don't know what I'm gonna do without you guys, But... I'm gonna miss you every day. Stop crying. Don't go there. You know what? I'm not gonna go. Oh, no, no, no, no! I'm not gonna go. I'm gonna stay. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait. Th-This is not a goodbye, okay? This is a good thing. Come on, glasses up. Here's to Lisa. To Lisa! The next step is the right step, and you are taking the right step. Hear, hear. Lers? Sprinklers fall under Mikey's watch. No, no, no. Oh, no. Until Mikey is back from hockey camp, they fall under your responsibility, so... Mikey and I are gonna be parentless for three months, and you're worried about the lawn? I'm worried about a lot of things. I know. It's just nice to hear you say it. I say it. Dad, we handled Mexico. Mikey and I will be okay while you're in the Philippines. We're gonna make up for lost time when I'm back, I promise. By the time you're back, I'll be heading off to school. This is one of the last nights we'll be under the same roof. What's going on, man? You have one too many at the barbecue? That's hard to say. I think that says it all. This is a nice truck. Yeah. Makes a good bed, too. Crashing in it till I land an EMT gig in town. I thought, uh, thought you had some girl down here. Yeah, for a minute. She, uh... well, she gave me the old heave-ho. How come? I, uh... I don't know. I don't really remember. Look, Swanny, why-why don't you stay at my place, man, my apartment while I'm gone. You know, we're gonna deploy. I don't want to put you out, man. I'll find something. No, seriously. I mean, it's no skin off my nose. You should stay there. Are you sure? We're team guys; we got to stick together, right? Hey. Did you get some rest last night? Mm-hmm. Good. Couple things I want to go over with you. First, I don't want any parties in the house, you understand? No kegs. And that boy Noah, he's not even allowed to sniff the grass in front there, you understand? Considering you decided to clean your gun the last time he came over, don't think you need to worry about Noah showing his face at our house again. I didn't know that he was gonna be coming over. Oh, that's a lie. Come on, Emma. Listen, number two: what about the loans, the schools? Where are we with all that? We're not eligible. You're over the income threshold. That's crazy. That doesn't make any sense to me. According to the federal government, you're flush. Okay, that's great. I make too much money to qualify for financial aid, but not enough to pay for your tuition at school? Welcome to America. Well, okay, how about my G.I. Bill benefits? Covers about a quarter of the total tuition. Got to be kidding me. Military subsidized loans? It's too late to apply. It's too late to apply? That means you missed the deadline? You missed the deadline? How could you miss the deadline? I've got school, homework, student government, vocal lessons, my own life and our life I have to keep running when you're gone. I wish I could do it all perfectly. I could still apply for CommonBond, but they have an origination fee. Origination fee, great. How much does that cost? Don't know. I-I don't know what any of it means. Mom would know. Yeah. Mom would've known. You know, I like the "Work Lisa," definitely like me some "Party Lisa," but... I'll tell you what, kind of like this Lisa the best. Oh, you like this sweatpants, no makeup, gorging on strawberries Lisa? Yeah. Why do you have so many strawberries? Oh, well, I needed the crate. The crate? Yeah, 'cause... You see, I thought I'd, uh, well... I-I... I got you, like, a... Well, it's like, uh... Uh, oh, sorry. It's a going-away pallet. It's for you. Uh, the-the big one there, that's-that's, those are, those are top-notch chocolates. I'll bet they're good currency in OCS. It's like cigs in prison. Might save you from getting shivved. I don't think there's a lot of knife fights going down at OCS, but, um, thank you. Keep them boots shiny. Okay. Thank you. Yeah. Are you serious right now? Officer and a Gentleman? It's a damn fine film. Although, now I think of it, it does seem to make OCS, you know, a little ripe for romance. Do you just think that, like, every man is trying to seduce me? Just takes one. Mm-hmm. You trying to say something? No. Uh, well... yes. I-I was thinking, maybe, I would, I would tear up my punch card to the Pleasure Palace in Manila. As long as I don't play "find my car keys" on some hot candidate's body, right? Yeah. I'm good with that. Lisa... Sonny. Uh-uh... Don't say anything else. Okay. Okay. Yeah, okay. Yeah, I'm gonna be down here for a bit. Ring me whenever. I got to go. Yeah. My sister. She, uh... she wasn't too hip on me moving back down here. Love the place. Thanks again. Yeah, no, it's... no biggie. No, this is... this is it. It's not much, you know, and you can kind of see the whole place from right here. But help yourself to whatever you need. Um, plumbing's a little gunked up, so I... I got a, uh, a snake. It's underneath the sink if you... You all right? I think I left my-my phone in the car. You were just on it. Right. It's just my sister, she, uh, she calls a lot. The thing is, my, uh, my dad, he... he died two months ago. I'm sorry, man. I'm sure that's, I'm sure it's hard on her. It's harder for me. Women are better at loss. Men don't have a clue. Women process it. We just want to punch something. She gets worried if I don't answer. She's... she's a good sister. Gucci deployment. Huh? I'm jealous. Yeah, you know. I'm kind of in the mood to fight right now, if I'm being honest. I get it. Keeps the mind occupied. But trust me, a little bit of fun can do a world of good. A PACOM deployment is a terrible thing to waste. Hey, babe, it's about time to get on... There he is. Pastor Mel. Hey, just thought I'd drop by. Oh. Haven't seen you in a bit, Ray. Yeah, well, uh, I've been busy getting ready for deployment. Yeah, well, I guess you're gonna have to content yourself with having Bible study on base then, huh? Yeah, something like that. Um... Uh, what is this? What's... what's going on? Well, we just thought we'd set a baptism date for baby RJ. Uh, I don't know. Well, listen, Naima and I will handle all the details. You know, we'll figure out a good time, after your deployment, of course. No. I-I mean, I mean, I don't know. I, uh... I... You know what, Pastor Mel, this r... this really isn't a good time right now. You think maybe I could, uh, talk to my wife? Alone. Of course. Of course. I have another appointment anyway. I'll be praying for you, Ray. Have you lost your damn mind? Excuse me? You bring him over here to ambush me? No, he dropped in, like he said, because he's worried about you. He's worried? About me? He's not the only one. Y-You're drinking too much, ignoring the family. I mean, what is going on? Nothing's going on, Naima. All right, the team's needed me more than usual. Everyone's going through a lot right now. Well, you won't talk to me. About what?! Mexico. What happened in Mexico? Nothing. Okay, honey? Nothing happened in Mexico. Okay. Well, how about why you don't want RJ to be baptized? What do you care about it anyway? Naima, you don't even believe in God. What does someone like you care about something like that? This isn't you. This isn't the man I married. This is the man I found. The broken sailor who needed six whiskey gingers to sleep. I don't want that man to come home from the Philippines. I'm driving myself to base. You say goodbye to me! You tell me you love me! Ray! Hey. Ready to head to the airfield? I spoke to CommonBond. If we pay the origination fee, they'll process my loan. Okay, um, I have to pay this now? 2% of the total four-year loan. Well, we have three weeks. Emma, I, um, I have to move money and everything. You don't want me to go, do you? You want everything to stay the same, like we're stuck in time. You don't want me to leave when you leave every two seconds. It's not that. Then what is it? It's not... Look, it's the loans. I don't want you to spend the next 20 years drowning in debt and all you have to show for it is a... is an art degree. Wow, Dad. I'll figure it out on my own. Have fun over there. You know, Ray, last time you showed up at the tarmac alone, you were single. Uh, it's... it's Jameelah; she got the flu. Yeah. Yeah. Emma... she must have the same bug. Yeah, must be going around. Yeah. Something's going around. Man, it's hotter than a two-dollar pistol out here. It's way more balmy than Baghdad. There ain't enough talcum powder in the world to keep my boys from chafing. Beats the hell out of that dog kennel we were in in Mexico, though. All right. Welcome to the Gucci, boys. All right. Yeah. Two days till the first training exercise, so until then, your time is yours. Jace and Ray. Standard liberty rules apply. Trent, Brock. Behave yourselves, make sure I don't have to do any paperwork, got it? Whoa, no, bad idea. He's gonna lose that. - That is a good call. - More importantly, Blackburn, how many times a day can I go to the omelet bar? That's all I want to know. Oh, gosh. Come on. I'm out. Be sure to look into that. Yeah. Figure that out later on. Hey, any word from Mandy? Embassy. Anything brewing? Uh, nothing to talk about yet. Mm-hmm. Got the VDR from the container ship. One day here and you're already searching for a new target package? Four maritime collisions in the region the past four months, two mysterious plane crashes? I'd say the target package chose us. Captain, the navigational system isn't responding. We're heading right for that ship. Go to manual. It won't respond. Override. Captain, I tried to override. Someone else has control of our ship. Captain, coming at us, portside! Sound the alarm. Collision alarm not initiating! Brace for impact. A remote takeover of all navigational systems. Who could pull that off? Not many. Hey, I'm gonna go crush the gym. You coming? Man, you never slow down, do you? Why would I? Well... I'm thinking about, you know, heading into town and getting a little massage. Why don't you come? We've only been here 20 minutes and you already want an old-fashioned? I'm talking about a real massage. See, I-I got this kink in my neck, so I called the concierge about them firm pillows 'cause of my slipped disk. Them big ol' pillows here, they're messing with my sciatica. Who are you and what have you done with Sonny Quinn? Huh? Sonny Quinn's happy place used to be kicking in doors. Yeah. Making canoes out of skulls, covered in stripper glitter, and getting drunk. And now it's this? It's... ...it's soft pillows and legit massages? Come on, dude. Hey, you are getting soft, buddy. There's a time and a place for everything, young Jedi. But you ain't ever been on a Gucci mission with Sonny Quinn. I am a man of leisure. Now, if you want to be ready to charge, you got to recharge the mind and the body. Look around, man. Why don't you go chase some tail? Doesn't appeal. Well, what does? The job. All right. All right, well, you enjoy that nice little massage there, princess. I will. Maybe later we can hit Bed Bath & Beyond. What the hell's Bed Bath & Beyond? Emma? You kidding me? Emma, you there? Emma, are you there? I answered the phone, didn't I? All right, look, Emma. Just do me a favor, will you? Just, um, let's breathe this out and be calm. I just want you to e-mail me all the loan applications so I can help you out with it, all right? Whatever. Look, um, I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry the way we left things. And how we got into that whole argument. I didn't like it. You know, I love you, and I... I miss you. I... And I wasn't talking to anybody and she didn't hear a word I said because it got disconnected. Hayes. How you doing? No way. Zell, what's up? How you doing, man? Hey. Good to see you. Good to... God, to be honest, I didn't even recognize you. Wow, look at that. Nice watch. Ah, a little flashy for my taste, but it was a gift from a client. And he has nuclear capabilities, so... You're working private security now, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Six international offices now and opening more every day. It's been quite a ride. Yeah, I bet. Feels like a lifetime since we were, uh, eating sand in J-Bad, huh? Uh, I think we were doing more than just eating sand. So you're still in? You're still grinding? Yeah, yeah. Still in, still grinding. You know, pays the bills. Yeah, well, not as much as it should though, am I right? Yeah. Hey, look, I, uh, I'm gonna be around for a few days; you-you want to grab a beer? Sure. Yeah, I don't think they can handle us, but yeah. Look, I got to, uh, I got to take this. But I'll reach out. Okay, yeah. Good to see you, man. Good to see you, too. Yeah? - My name is - Gunnery Sergeant Miller. I am your enlisted instructor. My mission over the next 12 weeks is to do only one thing, and that is to take what is ordinary, you, and turn you into an officer. If you don't possess the highest integrity and military virtue, know your history, and give nothing less than 100% at all times, you will not make it! If you do not love your country, then you already are a pathetic failure and I will send you back to whatever hole you come from, branded forever as the failure you are. If you D.O.R., drop on request, I won't care, because I'm not your mama or your keeper. You will simply give up, walk out that door, and no one here will ever think about you again! Did I tell you to eyeball my area, Candidate?! No! Shut your mouth! Did I say speak?! I will treat each of you equally until I expect something of you. From then on, welcome to Darwinism. Survival of the fittest, the strongest, and the smartest. I am not supposed to put it in those terms, but that's what it is... real life... which will be quite a change for you safe-space, snowflake, fly under the radar, don't want to be noticed, pajama boys and girls, understood?! Yes, ma'am! Yes, Gunnery Sergeant! That was my first expectation, that you answer a question correctly. Very simple, yet most of you failed. Except for you. You prior enlisted, Candidate? Yes, Gunnery Sergeant, eight years! Thought you looked a little old for OCS. Where you from, Candidate? Detroit, Gunnery Sergeant! Once a decent city ruined by parasites and bureaucrats. Candidate Davis, part of my duty is to appoint a leader to each class. This is a very serious responsibility, and I am giving this responsibility to you. Do you think you are up to it? Yes, Gunnery Sergeant! I have been a marine for 15 years and an instructor for three. And in every class, every single one of them, the first leader D.O.R.'d. Why? Because what all leaders must come to terms with is that they will be treated unequally. And that is the weight that they crack under, the weight of actual responsibility, actual accountability, and it actually being your ass on the line. So, everything that your class does wrong, starting now, is your fault. Nice house. But I know the guy who lives there. I don't think he's the selling type. Can't stay away from me, huh? What's that about? This? This is about... college. That's what that is about. Emma's. Yeah, Emma's. Was trying to figure out how to pay for it. Yeah, I hear you. Mm-hmm. Rate I'm going... I'll have my loans paid off in 2050. Mm-hmm. See, that's the thing. I don't want her to be in debt for her whole life. Right? I mean, you really think that she can make it as a singer? Odds are better in New York than Virginia Beach. Look, Jason, she's got a dream. If she's anything like her father, she's gonna follow it with or without your help. I just wish I could pay for it, that's all. Straight-out. But I can't, you know? Well, if you sell the house... ...put a good dent in the cost. Yeah. Selling the house. It's tough. Lot of memories there. A lot to think about. Yeah. Yeah, it is. Well, you're looking great. You getting out there again? Back in the saddle, you mean? Nothing serious, I would say. Oh. But, uh, yeah. Good for you. How about you? Oh. Whoa, look at that, huh? Saved by the buzz, aren't we? We got to go. Okay. Got this? Yep, I got it. That's for you. Four days ago off the coast of Japan, a Navy supply ship collided with a container ship. One casualty, a billion dollars of damages. The collision was as a result of a coordinated cyber attack. The nav systems of both ships were compromised. Just an hour ago, Filipino tanker in the Sulu Sea was targeted by the same malware. It ran into an underwater mountain. Had that tanker been full, we'd be looking at a massive ecological disaster. We were able to pinpoint the source of the most recent attack to a small aircraft, which appears to have crash-landed here, an island in the South China Sea, Panatag Shoal. We need to recover this technology. Studying it will allow us to defeat it. Well, South China Sea, that's contested territory. Exactly. So no ISR. Zero footprint. Make things more difficult, Panatag Shoal is covered with dense jungle and bamboo forest, so we have no eyes on the wreckage. Any survivors in the crash? Also unclear. The Chinese will be sending its own team to get the tech. You're to refrain from engaging unless fired upon. There's been no movement in or towards the area, so let's infil quickly and get out before the enemy arrives. Let's go. Havoc, this is 1. Passing Redline. Copy, Bravo 1. Passing Redline. Last signal from the HVT was about two klicks northwest of your position. - Copy that. - Proceeding to Diamondback. Fuselage has got to be close. Havoc Base, this is Bravo 2. We passed Jaguar. Copy, Bravo 2. Passing Jaguar. Proceed with caution. Someone climbed out. Means we got a survivor out there. Havoc, this is 1. We got two dead. Looks like we got a survivor, left the trail. Copy, Bravo 1. Stand by. If that person is alive, we need to bring them in right away. He could be a gold mine of intelligence. He might've taken some of the tech with him. Bravo 1. You're cleared hot to track down the survivor. Copy that. Split in three. - Brock. Get a scent. - Yup. Roger that. Check here. Hey, boss. This rear compartment's inaccessible. We're gonna have to cut it out. All right. Fire up the saw. Brock, you got a scent? Yup. Sonny. Clay. Go with him. Roger that. - Find the survivor. - We'll pull security. What is that? Chinese military does regular exercises in the area. Havoc Base to Bravo 1. How long till you have control of the target? How much longer?! How much time? Five minutes. Havoc, this is 1. We got five mikes, Havoc, five mikes. We have a high-altitude aircraft entering your airspace. Could be Chinese military exercise, but we don't know. Be aware. Havoc out. There he is. Come on, get him. Halt! Don't let the bedbugs bite. Havoc Base, this is Bravo 6. I see what appears to be five HAHO jumpers. Copy that, Bravo 6. If this is Chinese Special Forces, this'll get ugly. Chinese soldier hasn't fired on an American since the Korean War. That might change today. Hey. Yeah? They're gonna be able to triangulate our position using our radio signals. We need to go dark until exfil. Havoc, this is 1. We got to go dark on our comms. We'll meet you back at Redline for exfil. Bravo 1, out. Copy that, Bravo 1. Hey, we can't go back the same way we came. Way these guys are dropping in, we'll go right past them, lead them to the exfil point. We don't got time to take the long way home. Y'all go that way, I'll-I'll circle round, meet up with you. I'm gonna take my radio and see if I can create some sort of false trail. It's not a good idea for you to be out there solo. Neither is getting into a firefight with a bunch of Chinese PLA. Spenser. All right. It's good. Let's go. Come on. Spenser. I swear, that kid is not right in the head. I'll grab this. - J. - Yeah? They already found us. On the ridge. They're marking the plane with lidar. They're gonna bomb the site. That's just gonna destroy the tech, keep it out of our hands. Gonna claim that we weren't here. Yeah. Let's move! We got to go! J. How much you want to bet that's a Xian H-6 bomber? All right, we got to roll. We got to move! Turn it off! Let's go! Move! Talk to me. All right, we got to move, Trent, let's go. Come on, give me one. All right, let's go, let's go, let's go. I got your back! Let's go, let's go. Sonny, hey! Where's Clay? He's creating a false path for non-friendlies to follow. You kidding me. How thick can a Texas boy be letting him go on alone? He gave me no choice. Hey, where's your radio? On the hill, so the PLA track away from us. Should buy us a few minutes. It was your responsibility, Candidate, to inspect your class' quarters in advance of the RLP inspection. Yes, Gunnery Sergeant. Items were mislabeled. Summer whites thrown wrinkled into a corner, and sand, sand in Candidate Salmon's dress shoes. Why did you fail? There wasn't enough time to properly inspect the rooms, Gunnery Sergeant. Not enough time. That's no excuse. Something's wrong with you, inside. I can see it. You're defective, aren't you? No, Gunnery S-Sergeant Miller. Oh, you lying to me? Something is wrong with you. I'm-a find out what it is. Hold that leaning rest while all your classmates pass inspection. If you can't get them to do something as simple as clean their rooms, you are worthless as a leader, worthless to me, and worthless to the Navy. Their failure is your failure. Now resume the position, Candidate. Yeah? Let's go, let's go. I spoke to PACOM today. All right, and? Well, they're not exactly thrilled that our boy Clay left an encrypted communication device in the hands of the Chinese. Okay, well, our orders were not to engage, and his move prevented engagement. Yeah, well, I'm not the one that needs convincing. As far as Command is concerned, this falls under the broader pattern of risky behavior. I'm sorry, risky behavior? Okay, like what? Last-ditch raid on Doza's compound. We got him, didn't we? Jason, cut the attitude. All right, this could affect you, me, the entire team. We need Command to be happy with us, or our lives... are gonna become extremely unpleasant. Right. Gotcha. Ray-Ray, where you heading? Yo.
