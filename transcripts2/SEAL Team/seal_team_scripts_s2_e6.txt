 - Previously on SEAL Team... - Graham Kowit, American DEA agent, missing a few weeks ago and I'm guessing you know where to. You must consider the possibility that Agent Kowit might be dead. I can live being afraid for you. I just need you to take my fear seriously. I'm still gonna love Stella, and that's not gonna change. All well and good, Clay. Until you come home in a box.

 Clay! Man down! He took a round directly to his chest plate. Mikey and Emma need a dad, not a team leader. I'm the one who was supposed to die. We're wheels up for Mumbai in 20. Need you on that plane, as Bravo 1. Jason. Standing down. His choice. Adam was killed in action. Gave his life to save his brothers. Now, as a proctor of the Adam Seaver Memorial Open, - I'm just saying, Blackburn... - Yeah. your blood-alcohol level is

 way below tournament requirements. - That's right! Roger that! - Drink up! That's a nice shot, ace! Where's he... where's he going? So this was Adam's refuge, huh? Every chance he got. I wish I, uh, had joined him more. Playing golf. I just didn't... Yeah, I rain-checked him a dozen times. That's the rub, huh? Always think there's gonna be another chance. Blackburn... that is a two-beer penalty - for killing my buzz! - It's crazy! Yah-haw! Mind if we play through? You'd better run, Sonny! Whoo! Get up! You'd better run. Oh! Oh! What do you say we have another one, huh? Ah, you don't have to ask me twice. One more. You know, if things went crazy in here, then I would always end up out there. Your happy place. Yeah. This is my happy place. How's it going with the kids? I'm just trying to stay flexible, you know? I just want to pick my battles. Must be hard alone. Some days it, uh, kind of works. What about our next deployment? Thought about that? What? About me not being here for three months, the kids alone without Alana? Of course I've thought about it, Ray. Any conclusions? I think conclusions is that I don't want to think about it, okay? Well, love you, brother. You just got a lot on your plate. What do you say we go outside and talk the carburetor into working? You think you can do that? Let's get the carburetor working. - Well, it's last call. - Mm-hmm. Shouldn't you be finding a pair of boots - to knock up against? - Mm. Well... tonight's recon yielded no actual targets there, Davis. I see plenty. Based on your high standard of living, what do you need? - Female, breathing, right? - Ooh. Wow, look at that. That was a low blow right there. I happen to have standards, okay? And they're real ones. - Such as? - Well, uh, I like 'em to get my motor running, that's for sure. That's obvious. What else? Well, they got to be able to keep up with me. Sonny, I could keep up with you. That right there, Davis, that's what makes you a rare woman. Right? What else? Heart. Gots to have heart. - Mm-hmm. - Pride. And loyalty. Woop, woop. You know, I like a little... a little fight in a woman, too. - She... - Are you looking for a woman, or are you looking for a racehorse? You see... I'll have you know I was raised by a mama and two sisters that kick the balls off a bull in Sunday heels. Okay? And maybe, I don't know, maybe that spoiled me a little bit. It might have, because that is a lot to ask for at last call. That just depends on what kind of bar we're in, I suppose. All right, so let's say that you find said woman, right? - Mm-hmm. - This is it, this is it. A rare and elusive specimen, I assure you. - Elusive. I like that. - Yes. Who's to say that you could even handle her? No one. You see, that's the fun of it. - Yeah. - Or the trouble of it. Well... it ain't fun... if it ain't trouble. You two done? Yes. We're done. I got this. Actually, that's way too much money. - You get it. - I'm not getting that. Ooh, please tell me that's coffee. I, uh... I stopped by the frame store. We're gonna put it up at the bar on the wall with the, um... The others? Yeah. Nice. Yeah. It's getting better. - Doesn't look like it's getting better. - Well, it was a 7.62 round... I mean, it's... you know, it leaves a little bit of a mark. - It'll heal. - When? It's been six weeks. Stella, it'll heal. Don't move. Please. I'm not putting that stuff on. That stuff smells like an old lady in a tube. - It's terrible. - This stuff makes that go away. Just let me do it. - Mm. - Don't move, please. Well, you know, it's... it's not ink, so it's not - gonna wipe off. - Shut up. Is everything okay with you? Yeah. Fine. See? It's already looking better. Mm. You have to go shopping tonight? Yes, I do. Winter formal is next month. Okay, listen, you have tons of dresses there in your closet. You got a bunch of them. You've got more dresses than - I have socks. - That's true. Seriously? I live with cavemen! Aw, ooga-booga. And I have plans. - It's Saturday. - I don't care if it's Saturday. - You know I cannot... - I can't bail on Franny and Lulu - to watch Caveboy. - Grandma is out of town. She's not here Saturday. House to myself. Party. I'm not taking him to the mall! That's social suicide! I'm not going! And stop! This is all new to us right now. This new situation's been presented to us. We're gonna work through this, you understand me? Emma, you're gonna take Mikey to the movies, so you're not seen with him. I'll leave work early to get him, so you have your night with your friends. Okay. All right, Mikey's with me. Give me a hug. All right? Come here. Hey. It's gonna be all right, buddy. Okay, we got this. One shift at a time. You understand? Okay? We got more eyes in here than usual. Good morning, everyone. Bravo Team is about to prosecute a highly sensitive target package that's taken months to put together. Final approval came from the White House, so we need everyone to be squared away on this one. There's no margin for error. Understood? Andres Doza. He's the head of the most lethal cartel in Mexico, and one of the most slippery fugitives alive today. We've only confirmed four sightings of him in the last decade. His top lieutenants are equally elusive. Doza was born in 1978 in Huaquechula. His parents were farmers. He's exported more dope to the States than anyone in history, amassing a fortune unimaginable. All right, look, we know who this guy is. What's the mission? You're gonna hunt him down. - All right. - "Hunt him down"? We're-we're cleared to operate down in Mexico? Yes. Partnering with Mexican Marines. Might take a while to locate him. Maybe weeks, months. But you're in Mexico for as long as it takes. Excellent. A little R and R south of the border. That sounds good to me. It's not a booty run to Cabo, Sonny. Doza's cartel has thousands of soldiers, a $20 billion war chest, and the most sophisticated weaponry money can buy. If El Chapo was Saddam Hussein, then Doza is ISIS. He's sadistic, vicious and indifferent to innocent life. Well, that's great. He's been that for a decade. Why are we engaging now? He crossed a line. He executed an American DEA agent. From the people of México, remember... only Andres Doza protects you from foreign invaders. Mm. The video goes on for 30 minutes. Wheels up at 0700 tomorrow. I suggest you spend the rest of the day getting your affairs in order. Captain Harrington has the final word. Nobody does us like that. You go to Mexico, you find Doza, you don't come home till he's in cuffs or a coffin. Is that understood? All right, we're done here. - Sync and corrections by ByDem - - www.addic7ed.com - - Master Chief. - Yeah. A word before you shove off. - Pep talk? - More like a watch-your-ass talk. Listen, I don't need a bunch of SEALs making bad headlines in our own backyard, right? Sir, you have concerns? Just want to make sure everyone's focused. Oh, okay. Everyone. You mean me when you say "everyone." Look, given everything that Bravo's been through the last months, some people may think that, you know, this should have gone to Alpha or Charlie. Some? Everything that Bravo's been through has only made us stronger. So the only person that should be concerned is Andres Doza. That's who should be concerned, sir. Music to my ears, Hayes. Look, I hate to spring this trip on you, but you know how it goes. And you don't know when you're coming back? No, buddy. Don't worry, Dad. Grandma Linda will be great. What about hockey tryouts? What about hockey tryouts? You're ready, huh? You're prepared. Where's your first shot go? Straight in the goalie's face mask. Right. Why? 'Cause you want to get in his head. Get in his head. Right? Yeah. I'm gonna try and get back for winter formals. I know. But it will be easier to get a date without you around to interrogate him. - Really? - Mm-hmm. I have drones. They will be overhead. Scary thing is I sort of believe you. You should. If you need anything, Aunt Naima, - she's got my credit card. - Mm-hmm. All right? Get yourself a dress. - Thanks, Dad. - All right. Listen, hey. Make sure there's a lot of material to cover things. I will. Mm. Hey, look at me. You're gonna be okay. - Okay? - Okay. - Okay, you take care of him. - Yeah. I will. - All right? - Like you said, we're figuring things out, as a family. Oh, wait. Um, we made you a calendar. Mm. I marked our schedules so you know what we're doing and the good times to Skype. - You made a calendar for me? - Mm-hmm. Wow. Dad, just... come home safe. That's what your mom used to say. I know. All right, look, group hug. Come on. Group hug. I love you guys. - Love you. - Love you, too. You sure everything's fine? Please be careful. Look, I know I... I know what happened in Mumbai is really bothering you. - I get it. - We don't need to talk about that. What's going on? Everything is fine. Stella, why are you saying everything is fine? Look, I-I can't... I can't be dodging bullets if my mind is back here worrying about you. If there's a problem, I can fix it. - I don't... - Just-just... just get on the plane. - Please. - What? Stella, it's-it's me. Just go. Please, just go. Dude, talk to me here. Come on... Just that... You're everything. All right? You're everything. I-I... I love you more than I thought that I could love someone, - and... - Then what-what is the problem? - I don't understand. - Th-This. All of this. This is the problem. Is that the more that I love you, the harder it gets. Okay? When you leave, I don't sleep at night. I have this constant pit in my stomach. And-and I'm afraid. I'm afraid of every phone call. I'm afraid of every knock at the door. The knock is never gonna come. I'm not... You got shot six weeks ago, Clay. - You can't promise me that. - I'm not gonna... Look, any-anybody could die at any time doing-doing anything. No. Don't bring up Alana's death. Her death was tragic luck. But Adam... that... That was an eventuality. And I don't think I can... I don't think I can live my life waiting for that to happen to you. What are you saying? I think that you deserve someone that will embrace your life, not resent it. Someone that's better than me. I love you. I do. I love you so much, but I don't... I don't think that I can be with you anymore. Hey! We're wheels up, Romeo. Let's go. Come on. I'm so... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Everybody, this is Rita Alfaro, my counterpart in Mexican intelligence and the liaison for our operation here. Bienvenidos. On behalf of Mexican CISEN, welcome. We look forward to working with you in the spirit of cooperation. Yeah, well, I'm more interested in the spirit of air-conditioning. Why so many? We don't want anything to happen to you on the way in. You'll want your weapons hot. Let's load up. Broad daylight. Largest metropolitan city in the world. And they are seriously worried about a hit? I already got a bad feeling, brother. Join the club. So this is what you do, huh? Do? Cartel hunter. Sure. Any wisdom to share? They're everywhere, and you'll never know who to trust. Well, since you brought it up, Doza owns plenty of people down here, Mexican Marines included. No offense, Lopez. The state police, they're all bad. Yeah, the Federales are questionable. But every Marine on this operation was handpicked by Colonel Martinez. I trust him, so I trust them. Why should we trust you? You shouldn't. Well, I can officially say that nothing about this conversation has made me feel any better. Lot of hero worship with Doza. He builds schools, hospitals, provides services the government can't. He buys hearts and minds. Who's that guy? The posters mean Doza's cartel has marked him for death. - What did he do? - A couple of Doza's men kidnapped and raped his daughter. He reported it to the police. Biblical-level wickedness. In America, power is accrued through money. In México, power is accrued through violence. Did you know there have been more deaths here in the last decade than in Iraq and Afghanistan combined? That's madness. Welcome. Doza has his eyes and ears on every military base and police station in the country, so we've made this old factory our unit's home. Lieutenant Commander Eric Blackburn. Colonel Francisco Martinez. - Welcome. - Thank you. Though in the interest of transparency, I was not in favor of your presence here. It's my job to find Doza. How's that working out? We're only here to help, Colonel. Any way we can. Excellent. You can help by following the rules. No alcohol or women in the barracks. Lieutenant Lopez will show your men to their quarters. We will all meet once they're settled. This way. Thank you. Master Chief Hayes, you are Bravo Team's direct leader, yes? - That's right. - Good. Here, I am yours. You understand that, correct? Understood. This place makes our hooches in J-Bad look like Graceland. I've slept in nicer prison cells. No booze. Was he serious? I hope so. Without rules, there's only windows and noses to break. I'm assuming you brought the emergency cache? - You know it. - Ooh. Should last a night or two. Oh, yeah. That stuff's fire, man. Yeah. Aw. Looky here, Ray. You ever seen a cuter couple? Oh, like the couple in the picture frame when you buy it. Saying good-bye never gets any easier, brother. You just remember what you got waiting for you when you get back home. So, a country of 125 million people, and no one knows where Doza is? Nine months ago, he visited a girlfriend in Jalisco. But Doza was tipped off to our presence. He slipped away before we arrived. The man responsible for Doza's security was found skinned alive. Whenever we find a weakness to exploit, Doza eliminates it. Okay. Well, is there anything we can actually go on here? Graham Kowit's execution video. This is Carlos Gonzalez. He's Doza's version of "Jihadi John." He acts as an executioner and a propagandist. I thought we were here to catch Doza, not chase around his little street rats. No way he kills a DEA agent without approval from the top. If we grab Gonzalez, he could connect us to Doza's inner circle. - So where is he? - Telporo. It's a cartel-controlled slum. It's where I was born and raised. Doza's soldados are interspersed among the locals there, so it's impossible to tell who's bad, who's good. We set at the edges of the neighborhood, blend in. And we wait for Gonzalez to come out. Until somebody leaks that we're onto him and then he disappears. I lost five men in a raid there last year. Lopez is right. We take Gonzalez on our terms, outside of that powder keg. Oh, so you want us to sit and wait. There's no chance. We're gonna take it to him. We hope they're gonna want to fight. And you know what we're gonna do? We're gonna punish 'em. 'Cause we're gonna send a message. Five minutes here, and you have all the answers, huh? You want to play cat and mouse, go ahead, play cat and mouse, but you see, we're an assault team. That's what we do. We assault, so that's what we're gonna do. We're gonna go in, and we're gonna grab Gonzalez. Small village, locals on the payroll of a killer. It sounds like Afghanistan to me, right? So let's rip from our own playbook. - Offset infil. - Yep. Patrol to the target on foot. - Combat clear. - Combat clear. - It's like you two were never apart. - No. Neighborhood is gonna recognize us being outsiders. We need to go indig. ¿Cómo se dice "Scooby van"? No. We can't do vans. Gonna need something heavier than 416s in case something goes sideways, you know what I'm saying? You bet your ass we will. IT2, set up the ISR link ASAP. - Roger that, sir. - Right. We believe that this is Gonzalez's home. It's two stories. If Martinez and Lopez give us enough shooters to split in three groups, we'll clear the floors simultaneously. Actually, Lieutenant Lopez is not going on this raid. I'm sorry, what's that? I'm from Telporo. - I'm known there. - It's too dangerous for him. Danger's kind of, uh, part of the whole soldier thing. - Lopez is not going. - Well, then, I don't want him in this meeting hearing the details of our raid. You don't trust me? No. I don't trust you. Hard to trust a soldier who doesn't fight. Lopez. Lopez is a good soldier, but he is a little volatile. Please, continue. Okay. Rules of engagement. Don't fire unless fired upon. The entire community of Telporo is on Doza's payroll. So once we enter, anywhere along the way, whoever we see could kill us. In fact, many of them would love to kill one of you. It would be like a trophy for them, a prize. If we are compromised in any way, Doza's soldados will unleash hell on us, so I suggest placing our set point outside of their territory. Okay, we'll do that. Let's roll. American hero. Thinks he knows how to fight our war. You should show Colonel Martinez a little bit more respect. You should respect him enough to fight next to him. Don't question my loyalty. I question a lot more than that. Telporo's my home. And I grew up with those thugs. Anybody knows that I'm in the Doza unit, they kill everyone I ever knew. Nobody's gonna know, 'cause you're not gonna be there. Ray. Hold up. Uh-oh. This can't be good. Thanks. Can't a girl just say hi? Absolutely, but not this one. - Mm. - Let me guess. You want to talk about my friend? It took months to convince SOCOM to greenlight this op, and with everything that's happened... You're concerned about Jason's headspace. You mean you don't have concerns? Come on, Mandy. The guy's got a lot to deal with. That's precisely why I'm concerned. We won't catch Doza if Jason's head is elsewhere. Tough to doubt a man that comes out on the right side as often as Jason does. But... I'll keep an eye on him. Be enough? I feel like these Mexican uniforms are like the skinny jeans of military apparel. Yeah, well, I'm pretty sure our hosts don't want us flashing Old Glory across the city, right? It's just they're just so formfitting, you know? I-I swear on the Bible, my testosterone count is dropping as we speak. Well, look on the bright side, Sonny, right? At least that uni helps highlight your enormous ass. Well, I sense some jealousy there of my gluteus maximus. See, look at this: the bend and snap. - Hey, wait, wait. - Why's Sonny ass look so big in those pants, huh? - You hear that? - All this talk about my backside is seriously making me reconsider my commitment to Bravo right now. Gentlemen, my men here will drive us to the target. - Eyes open, weapons ready. - All right, let's load up. Oh. It looks like we're not the only ones working tonight, huh? It's good to see you reconsidered. Doza teach Sunday school there? The priest would remove that poster, but he would be killed immediately. Thought this was a no-go zone for police. For Federales and military. They're local, on Doza's payroll. Havoc Base, this is Bravo 2. We pass Black Lab. How copy? Yeah, roger that, Bravo 2. We copy Black Lab. We here to rob a bank or put the hurt on Gonzalez? Anybody working against Doza is killed by Doza. What do you say in Spanish before you go on a mission? Que la Fuerza te acompañe. Okay. Que la Fuerza te acompañe. Let's do this. Bravo 2, this is Havoc Base. You're headed to the two-story pink building half a klick to your east. Roger that, Havoc. Bravo out. Let's hustle, boys. Let's go. Bravo 6, pick up your pace. Bravo 1, this is Havoc. Be advised, we are observing five military-age males forming up one klick north of your pos. Copy, Havoc. Passing Golden Retriever. Copy Golden Retriever. Blow it. My eyes! Reinforced steel. Triple-locked. What do you think they're hiding in there? You hear that? No Gonzalez. The lookouts might have warned him. All stations, this is 1. First deck is clear. Bravo 3, what do you got up top? I need two mikes to figure out what's behind door number two, boss. I hope for a new car. Bravo 6, what's your status? Bravo 1. Could use a couple extra shooters. Prepping for a breach on a door. Copy that. Coming your way. I'm moving now. All stations, this is Bravo 3. I just saw the HVT squirt out of the east side of the target building. Bravo 3, we see one unknown exiting the east side of the target building, moving north of your position. I think that's Gonzalez. Good copy, Havoc. Break. Bravo 1, this is Bravo 3. I suggest we run down Gonzalez. Havoc can coordinate mobility platforms via ISR, - and we cut him off. - Negative, Bravo 3. Not without us. Stand by. Burning! Come on. Holy mother of God. Holy mother of God. Bravo 1, this is Havoc. We still have eyes on the HVT via ISR. Bravo 1, this is Bravo 3. If we don't move now, Gonzalez is gone. Why isn't Jason pursuing? There's enough time to catch Gonzalez if we move now. Bravo 1, this is Bravo 3. We can still get Gonzalez if we move. Am I cleared hot to go after him? 3, hold what you got. Say again your last, Bravo 1. Damn it. Negative, Bravo 3. Set security and hold what you've got. We've got civilians down here who are in bad shape. We got to get them out. I copy. Holding my position. The buildings at the top of the hill are connected. Gonzalez will disappear in that maze, and we'll have nothing to put us on Doza's trail. I'm sure he has his reasons for standing down. Yeah. They're back in Virginia Beach. - What about Gonzalez? - Another place, another time. Not enough guns to divide my force. I didn't say anything. All stations, stand by to exfil and SSE. Collect all phones, anything you can find. So the mission's over? Yeah, but not the battle. Bravo 1, this is Havoc. Be advised that we have what appears to be 20 armed combatants headed to your pos. Recommend you exfil immediately. Copy that, Havoc. We're RTB. 3, we're linking up with you in five mikes. Whoa! Havoc, this is 1. We need immediate extract. Bravo 1, I copy request for extract at target building. Stand by. Our trucks are never gonna get in there. It's too hot. Well, Bravo 1, target building looks too hot for an extract. Advise that you move to rally point one on foot. Trucks will meet you there. Copy that, Havoc. All stations, change of plans. The exfil trucks can't make it to us. We got to hoof it. We're not dodging all these bullets with all these prisoners, boss. Lopez, you're from here, right? Can you get us to those trucks without getting our asses shot off? Go out the back entrance. Do it. Smoke. Move, move, move! Move, move! Go, go, go, go, go. Go. Move. Know what? Whatever it is you want to say, just wait till morning. Your op just lit up every government line - from JSOC to the Pentagon. - Is that right? Hopefully praising us for saving six civilians from being tortured to death. Well, the target was Gonzalez. Dividing my force was not an option. Are you questioning me right now, Mandy? You know what, Jason? Given everything that's gone on in your life, I absolutely understand your hesitancy - to drive deeper into danger. - Hesitancy? The only thing that went into my thought process was the safety of my men. Alpha and Charlie leaders would've made the same call. We don't stand a chance of getting Doza if your head is back home. I didn't come here to lose. Neither did I. Ray? Give me the phones. Here you go. That's from Doza. Turn defeat into victory. You know what? May have come up short, but, you know, it was good having the team back. - Got that right. - Yeah. We're gonna get Gonzalez. That's not gonna happen. Why's that? Gonzalez knows he's targeted. Guy's gonna stay underground as long as he has to. - Missed our chance. - Oh, fun police. Gentlemen, if you insist on breaking my rules, at least don't insult our nation by drinking that donkey water, okay? - All right. - There he goes. Today we saw our enemy for the first time. You earned a drink. Thank you, Colonel. Que la Fuerza te acompañe, huh? Isn't that right, Lopez? You know that means "May the Force be with you," right? So you're a funny guy, is that it? Okay, I see you. It's a two-way street, man. Two ways. Colonel, you and your men are great soldiers. Likewise. Now, let's just make a deal, okay? You lead your men, and I lead mine. Just needed to know what kind of partner force we were dealing with there. - Mm-hmm. - Including your boy Lopez there. Just upset that we didn't accomplish the op, that's all. Well, let's not forget... you brought back farmers from the dead today, okay? And because of you, there are six families who are celebrating, not mourning. That's a victory in my book. Yeah. You know, when you put it that way, - it sounds much better. - Good. - Family is everything. - Salud. Which reminds me, I got an appointment to keep. Yep. You're awful quiet over here, Spenser. - Except when you're challenging Jason. - Mm. I saw your face when he stood us down. You were just as confused by the call as I was. Uh... look, man, I am still sitting here under God's stars because Jason makes the right call more often than not. No need to start us questioning him now. Look, I know this is a tricky one. Right? Whole team back together kind of puts you into the "new guy" mode again when you've more than proven yourself. That what eating at you? That's it. Thanks. Oh. - Howdy. - Howdy. You know, this is my first drink since the other night. - I'm still recovering. - Yep. We drank enough Maker's to kill a small horse. - Yeah. Yeah. - Ugh. And the end of the night, you know... - That's a little blurry. - Yeah, little bit. My memory's wiped cleaner than the Clintons' hard drives. We should probably, though, uh... avoid any... - repeat performances. - Definitely. Yeah. First of all, your top finger, it's got to be wrapped around it. Hold on. All right, try it again. Let's see it. Let 'er rip. That's not too bad. Just got to turn your wrist over a little faster next time. Mikey's getting good, Dad. Soon my shot's gonna be better than yours. No. As we know, if it's a shot, it's got to be a goal, and if it's a goal, it's got to be Bardownski. According to the, uh, calendar you guys made me, same time tomorrow? I think I can make that work, Dad. Wow, I've been gone a day, and you're already in some kind of demand. What was that? "Muerta." Marked for death. Gonzalez identified me. My family. Hell of a first day. - Sync and corrections by ByDem - - www.addic7ed.com -
