 Previously on SEAL Team...I don't want to be at each other's throats forever. I want to put it to bed, bury it. Want to bury it? Yeah, you're pretty good at burying things. Burying people, too. Wait, wait, we need him alive! Go, go! Come on, let's go! Go! Do whatever you need to do to save him. We lose him, we lose Doza. We lose Doza, we got nothing. We're back to square one.

 Martinez didn't rat us out. So who? It wasn't Carla who gave us up. It was you. I can't lose my family. Doza is everywhere. Tell me where he is, you get to live. Where's Doza?! Tell me! It's a safe house for when things go wrong. Hey. If you've come to point out the fact that I was riding you for not having your head in the game while I was sitting next to a turncoat, please don't.

 Look... I'm really sorry about Rita, all right? No one saw that betrayal coming. Led us right into an ambush. I used to think that some people were incorruptible, but... everyone's corruptible. Everyone has their breaking point. Not Martinez. He's a hero. I got to gear up. Jason. What I said in the club, I wasn't just trying to tell you what you wanted to hear. It was the truth. Yeah, I know. Are we good? Yeah, we're good. All right? Time to end this. Time to get Doza. Bravo 1, target building is 800 meters north of your location. Okay, we confirmed HVT's on target? Negative. But ISR shows fighting age males in the area. Havoc Base, blocking force is peeling off. We're coming up on target. All that dirty drug money and this is where Doza hangs out? Well, he knows how to lay low. Doza's a snake. Snake's as low as you can go. Yeah. Well, let's hope it's not another setup. Well, according to SEAL lore, a team can only be ambushed once per deployment. That's not really a thing. Yeah, I know, but I wish it was. Havoc, this is 1. I pass Conando. Copy, Bravo 1. Office building's the last place I thought we'd find Doza. He's smart. Anything ostentatious would draw attention. The team is moving into position. Bravo 1, we're standing by. Havoc, this is 1. Passing Aricebo. That's good copy, 1. Set. All elements, execute, execute, execute. Burn in! Bravo 1 clearing third floor. Bravo 6 clearing basement. Bravo 1 clearing second floor. Hey! Manos arriba! Manos arriba! Dame sus manos. Dame sus manos. Hey. Zip-zip tie her. Zip tie her. Clear! Dime, dónde está Doza? Eagle, Eagle, Eagle! Dó-Dónde está Doza? That's all the rooms. Dígame dónde está Doza ahorita.What's going on? What's she saying?She's not-- she's not saying anything. She says she doesn't know. Dígame, ¿dónde está Doza? What's going on?You understand. She's-she's saying she doesn't understand. She doesn't know.Ask her again. Dónde está Doza? Ask her again! ¿Dónde está Doza? Dígame ahorita dónde está! Si tú sabes, ¿dónde está? Wall charge. Havoc, this is 1. Passing San Juan. Target's not here. Found Doza's safe room. It's a dry hole. That's good copy, 1. We know. If there's a TV there, turn it on. I am Andres Doza, a businessman, and I am the victim of American criminal aggression. I am being hunted, in México, by United States soldiers. I am not a perfect man, but I am not the man that they say I am. It is the Americans who are the criminals, and I would rather give up my freedom than allow them to operate in secret on our soil. I am doing this so that my people will know the truth. I'm doing this for the Mexican people. You know what this is, right? Yeah, I know what this is. This is Doza's escape plan. Doza's lawyers released these shortly after his arrest. It's creating a public uproar. Look at those angles. Doza had men there taking pictures. American Special Forces engaging in combat on the streets of Mexico? It's not something the CIA or the Mexican SEDENA wants public. So say it. What does this mean? What does this mean? It means we're done. Bravo Team has been ordered to leave the country within 24 hours. I thought we had a chance this time. I could see an end to the plague of this man. I should have known Doza would slip away. That's how it always ends. The Mexican government sent us down here to get a job done. Yeah, well, the president, the president of this country, has ordered us out. Okay, so what-what are we gonna do? We just let this guy Doza run his cartel through some farce arrest? Or, better yet, continue to go after this guy and his family? Oh, and-- not to mention-- let them get away with murdering an American DEA agent? Is that what you're saying, Blackburn? No. We finish this. What do you want to do, Jason? You want to go after Doza alone? No military assets, no recon, in his home country. He controls the police. He controls everything here. Yeah, I do. That's what I want to do. I want to...No, it's not happening. Look, Mexican government knows where Doza is now, right? So why don't they just go in there and drop the hammer on him? The Chiapas region is a political powder keg. Capital fears intervention with federal troops will cause civic unrest. Doza cut our legs out from under us knowing that his government wouldn't come after him. Very clever. Guys, the minute that we leave Mexican airspace, this guy, Doza, he's just gonna be right out of jail and he's gonna be terrorizing this country. And Martinez died for nothing. So that's it? There's nothing left we can do? You know, there is. We got 24 hours. Meaning?Meaning, this guy Doza, he's a threat to the Mexican government. They want him just as bad as we do. If there's deniability, that's gonna give us another shot to go after him. That's not a bad idea. If SEDENA's fingerprints aren't on this, maybe I can persuade them. Good. Okay, listen. Feels like we've been on three ops and had no sleep. So let's get some rest. Yeah, if you're hoping for a Hail Mary for the win, you've already lost. C-17's en route. Let's get to packing. Oh, wow. I thought I told everyone to get some sleep. What are you still doing up? Yeah, you know, a little sleep has been hard to come by. Yeah. That seems to be the thing going around these days. No sleep, huh? Hey, I, uh, I shouldn't be questioning your judgment in the field. Forget it, man. You know what? You're frustrated. That's all. Besides, you almost got mudsucked, you know? And that'll do that to people, trust me. We'll try and keep that for the AAR next time. Not when we're, uh, stuck in a church, you know? Bullets about to fly. Yeah, I've just, been a little on edge recently, you know? Stella. Yeah. They told you, huh? Yeah. Sucks, man. I've been there. Eh, it's nothing compared to what you're going through, though, man. Look, Clay, you just... Come on, man. So, look, all we can do is... we just learn from our losses, not let them defeat us. Alana for me, Stella for you. All we can do is be grateful that they were in our lives. Come on, Clay. Good? Let's go. You got it.Yeah-- no. Not hugging, buddy. Took some arm twisting, but SEDENA's cleared us for one last run at Doza. We have till sunrise tomorrow. Let's hope the sun rises on his body, shall we? Let's go. Come on. So they're still kicking us out of the country, but the Mexican government is gonna let us take another crack at Doza? As long as they have plausible deniability, SEDENA's okay with us operating until the president's deadline. But they will not support us with assets or troops. It's a lot of risk, a lot of unknowns. Love risks, love the unknown. We've faced tougher odds.That's for sure. Much tougher. Well, we don't have time to recon. Don't have a Marine base to run the op out of. Yeah, well, C-17's coming, right? I mean, so why don't we just run Havoc out of that, like a million times before? Okay, to be clear: if you're detained, no one is coming after you. You are on your own.J Look, we get into the mansion undetected, I love our chances. But, again, that's up to the team. Shooter's got to shoot. I'm in. I hear Chiapas is lovely this time of year. With the Mexicans giving us their blessing and y'all chomping at the bit, op's a go. I'm coming, too. You get caught out there... I was acting on my own. That's what I'll say. I must finish what Colonel Martinez started. All right. Doza's prison compound is just off the coast, 500 miles directly to our south. Great. How we getting down there? Agency contact of mine managed to wrangle us a helo, off the books. There's one road in to the target, likely to be swarmed with guards and checkpoints. Wouldn't be an issue if we had a force of 60 soldiers. Don't have 60, we got seven. All right? So we got to come in a different route. Any ideas? This mangrove? Yep. This, uh, this mangrove swamp right here off the coast, right? I mean, this could provide some pretty good cover to get into his compound. A natural barrier like that will bog down most forces.RAY: Doza won't expect anyone coming from there. Mm-mm. So we'll chopper in offshore here, and we'll swim to the coastline. All this land between here and Chiapas, and yet, you find a way to get us to swim. Small swim. You're not gonna be eaten by a shark, Sonny. Yeah, but the jaguars in that mangrove, man, they could. What, there's j... there's jaguars? Yeah. Jaguars are the sharks of the jungle. You know that, right? Oh, well, that would make sense, 'cause they, they got them big old teeth and stuff, right? Can we just call in an airstrike? Negative. How far from the coast is Doza's mansion? About a nine-klick hike, inclined. Once you get through the mangrove, you'll hit arid coastal desert. Mm. That's at least six hours to get through that on foot. And no ISR under that canopy, so if Doza's men are patrolling, we have no way to warn you. Well, what about exfil? Whole region's probably gonna be after us. We're gonna need to get out quick. Once we hit jackpot at the mansion, the helo will land at the, the polo fields, and we'll be gone. Solid plan for 30 minutes. Yeah, well, you know what? We got 18 hours till our hunting license expires, so let's move. All right. Bravo 1 to Havoc Base, I pass Vader. Copy that, 1. Passing Vader. Welcome to the jungle. wasn't a jaguar. Want someone to hold your hand, Sonny? What I do want to get a hold of is my rightful place atop of the food chain. I've got six klicks to Doza. We need to be exfiling by midnight. Spend a lot of time in the bush? You know, my father would take me on hikes to Mayan ruins. Told me stories how they'd rip the hearts out of their people. That kind of violence, I couldn't imagine. Not so hard anymore, huh? Not so hard. Got a camp guarding the back door. Five enemy, at least. Havoc, this is 1. Copy that, 1. Enemy's 20 yards northwest of our position. All right, how many combatants? We got six visible. We engage, there might be more. So we'll cloverleaf around them and get back on route. All right, keep the detour tight. You don't have much slack in your timeline. Check. They didn't hear anything. Yeah. Didn't hear anything, but they're gonna miss him. Doesn't have any radio on him. Cache the body. It'll buy us a few minutes. Havoc, this is 1. We're at the target's perimeter. Copy, Bravo 1. We now have ISR above your position. Got that pesky jungle out of the way. I see 12 guards patrolling, regular pattern of movement. Closest two are 20 yards east. Copy, Havoc. We got 'em. Guess word got out about their buddy. Drop them. Let's go. All Bravo stations, six more enemy moving towards your position. We got six tangos coming our way. We holding cover or are we taking 'em from here? Take 'em from here. On me. Execute. Move. Move. Clear! Clear! Knees. Get on your knees. Keep your hands up. I didn't even hear the doorbell ring. Havoc, this is 1. Jackpot. Say again, jackpot. Alive? He's alive. Copy, Bravo 1. Extract helo is 30 seconds out. There's our ride. Clay, Lopez, stay here. The rest of us will secure a path for exfil. Not sure I'd be smiling. You've battled all this way only to condemn yourselves. I hate to spoil it for you, but that's not our plan, pal. I believe your plans have changed. Where'd those shots come from?Looking. Havoc, it's 1. Copy, Bravo 1. We're aware of the helo. We're looking for answers. I got a convoy of vehicles converging onto Doza's property. Who are they? I know who. Havoc, this is 1. Sitrep? Yeah, Bravo 1, this is Havoc Base. Be advised that you have a force of Chiapas state police approaching your position. Watch him. They shoot down the helo? Affirm. They claim the pilot was participating in the unlawful abduction of a prisoner in their charge. They're coming for Doza. And they brought an army. This is Comandante Salas of the Chiapas state police. I am ordering you to surrender Señor Doza peacefully, or we will take him by force. Maybe we should've had 31 minutes to plan this gig. This is Bravo 2 to 4 and 5. Find watch positions. Put guns on our visitors outside. Copy. In position. This is starting to remind me of the ending of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Jason's working on it. Havoc, this is 1. You got anyone higher up in the federal government who can call them off? They're trying. The Chiapas governor insists you're there unlawfully. Guess QRF's off, huh? Look, we knew the rules going in. If this thing goes sideways, SEDENA's position is that Bravo team was acting without their knowledge. Havoc, it's 1. Anyone from U.S. Command telling us to stand down? No. But once SOCOM grasps what's going on, how long you think that'll last, Bravo 1? Long enough for me to figure something out, buy some time. Bravo 1 out. Guys, options. I say we, uh, dress Doza up as a SEAL, duct tape a gun to his hand and kick him out the door. Then we talk to the comandante out there, soldier to soldier, see if we can get his bosses to see the light. His boss is this psychopath right here. Controls them all. Kill all their families if they don't do his bidding. I control no one. I am not a puppeteer. I lay out the options, and people choose. We smuggle him out. Got to be armed police at every door by now. Yeah, this guy's a drug lord. I mean, he's built this place. He's got to have some sort of tunnel getting out of here. There's no tunnel.Want to know where the tunnels are. Where are the tunnels? This goes sideways, you're the first one who's gonna get it. Right in the head. You lead us out, you live. Live? In a concrete hole in America? No, thank you. Besides, you are a soldier, not a murderer. If I catch a bullet, you and your men will go to jail. You will not let that happen, because you care more about their lives than you do about my death. Ironic. I have made you my protector. The tunnels. Where are they? Now! Your way out! You're thinking of Chapo, Pablo. That's the weak way, not my way. There are no tunnels. You will let me go. You have no other choice. Back it off. Come on. Move. You should not dismiss this concession. Oh, it's a hell of a bargain. We let a mass murderer walk, and you're kind enough not to gun down my men. You are foreign soldiers operating in a sovereign state. Doing as I say is the only way this ends peacefully. Your men are outnumbered. Stand them down, or they will die. You have ten minutes. You feel that? That charge in the air? Same feeling before a tornado comes. They're about to hit. If they do, it won't be a happy ending for you.Yeah? I don't know about that. I got a feeling the good guys are gonna win tonight. Havoc, this is 1. Chiapas police are readying for engagement. Copy that, 1. Stand by. They should turn him over. It's not your call, Ellis. Didn't say it was. Havoc Base to Bravo 1. Turn the HVT over and lay your weapons down. We're not losing any of you. Havoc, this is 1. Laying down. Jason, come on, man. Come on, boss. Weapons down. Now. You heard the man. Do it. We're not murderers. Yeah, but he's murdered thousands of people a year. If we stand down, how many more die? I'm more concerned about your blood. Take your weapon off, lay it down. Now. There's no justice in this. Juan, lay down the weapon. He'll face justice, Juan. Someday. Not here. This is México. Men like him own justice here. Lay down the weapon. Lay down the weapon. Now. Havoc, this is 1. Inform Chiapas police that we're disarmed. We're gonna hand off HVT. Ray, cut him loose. Clay, open the door so the Chiapas police can see that we're unarmed when they're coming down that hallway. Roger that. Havoc, this is 1. Inform Chiapas police that we are disarmed. Again, we are disarmed. Bravo 1, this is 4. Heard fire? 4, we're good. Hey. Hey. You shouldn't have done that. Wrong move. He had to die. I had no choice. We can't lie for you.I know. Manos arriba! Show us your hands. Manos arriba! Hands up now. You killed him. You killed Señor Doza. What happened here? My name is Lieutenant Juan Lopez. I killed Andres Doza. These men followed your orders and laid down their weapons. They had nothing to do with this. There's another possibility. What?It's possible, given the current situation, that Señor Doza here knew he was gonna be extradited to the United States. So instead of spending the rest of his life in prison, he shot himself in the head. You will testify to that?No. I can't. But you can. Whatever Doza has over you or this country is gone. No need to take a good man down with him. We just want to go home. Then go home. Look, if you, uh, feel like you need to take your family somewhere safe, like the States, I could always put in a good word for you. Jason Hayes, diplomat. That's right, and it doesn't come easy. Thank you. But this is my home. I'm going to fight for it. Well, there's gonna be plenty of fighting. Always gonna be another Doza in the wings. Yes, so we'll hunt them and kill them, so one day we can say the good guys win. It's been an honor. Take care of yourself, all right? Likewise. Get that hat on straight. Good luck, Lopez. Thank you. Mr. Spenser. Hmm? Nice cold beer for you, buddy. Thanks, bud.Yep. So, I'll bet, uh, returning home without Stella there doesn't make you quite as eager for shore duty, huh? Yeah, after sharing a hooch with you and your little night terrors, I'm actually looking forward to getting a place of my own. Right. Yeah. I'd rather be surrounded by a dozen Jihad Jerrys when I'm Winchester than heading home to an empty apartment. And that is why... we're going from base to the bar, painting the town red. Body glitter, honeys, whiskey and wine, that's the good life right there. I appreciate you looking out for me, brother, I do. Yeah.I'm all good. All right. Whatever you say there, Blondzilla. You are a good friend, Sonny. Easy there, Davis. Don't you get all feely on me. You did good work, Mandy. You did really good. I failed with Rita. Hmm? No, no. No, you didn't. You didn't fail with Rita. Okay? Rita failed herself. Ibuilt the Doza target package, piece by piece. I should have seen it coming. I should be better than that. And if... I stopped the ambush, Martinez would be alive. It's over. Game's over. Doza's dead. Don't beat yourself up. Victory came at a steep price. Always comes at a steep price. You know that. I know that. We also know that this was... supposed to be impossible. Look what you were working with. You had a shred of intel, right? You had a traitor constantly looking over your shoulder. You had a corrupt government that was in bed with Doza, and yet you still managed to get to Doza's den. And he's the one who ended up horizontal. It was worth it, right? Yeah. We saved lives, and... Martinez, he... he's at peace. Died a hero. No regrets. You know what we do, there's always a cost, Mandy. Just want you to know you don't have to hurt alone. Tell you what, I'm not a big hugger, but I'll make an exception this time. Come on, give me a hug. Get over here. Come on. There it is. You did good. Really good. How'd it go? It went good. I'm getting a lot better. Why are you driving Dad's truck? 'Cause Dad's out of town. Dad'll be psyched. First game's coming up. Oh, my gosh, I know. I cannot wait. It's gonna be so fun. All right. Okay. Taco time! Taco time!Oh, my... What? You jerk! What are you doing here?Ha-ha! How did you know we were here? Like I said, I have drones in the sky over you at all times. Oh.I told you that, right? Ha! Wait, whoa, whoa, wait a second. I'm sorry. Why are you driving my truck? That's what I said.Because you're supposed to be out of town. Did you really have to scare the living hell out of us?I loved it. The look on your faces was priceless. I'll always remember that. Taco time! Stop! Wait. Time out.What? What are you... Get out of the car. I'm driving. Let's go. Yo. Where's Clay?Whoa. Thought you guys were gonna paint the town. Uh, yeah, my little buddy bailed. Said something about sleep. Aw. Well, that means staring at the ceiling, thinking about Stella. Yeah, I feel for him.How's he doing? Uh, como ceviche,uh, "lower than a gopher hole"?[laughs] There. Pull up a chair there, Norm. Hmm.Don't make me drink alone. Hey, Tommy, can I get two shots of whiskey? The cheap kind. I didn't bring any cash. You got cash?Mm-hmm. The expensive kind. My pain Is self chosen At least So the prophet says I could either burn Or cut off my pride And buy some time A head full of lies Is the weight Tied to my waist The river of deceit Pulls down Oh The only direction we flow Is down Down Oh, down... Oh, and there I was, butt naked, no passport, in Kuwait with my buddy JT. Oh, man. Here.Oh... It's getting to be that hour. Call me crazy, but the last time we were here, didn't we, uh... What? I mean, not that we would ever... That was a moment. That was a fleeting moment.Fleeting? Fleeting.Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Come here. Everybody's good. I mean, the team. I mean, we're all home safe. Everybody's alive. Mikey is crushing it in hockey. You'd be proud. Emma... Emma, well, you know, she's a teenager, so there's that, right? But, um... she's just like you, Alana. Everything's different with you gone. I don't know how any of this works without you. You know, you know, I'm on the team. When I'm deployed, everything's good. When I'm back home, you know, I can convince everybody that I'm good, but, you know, deep down, I'm not. I'm not. I'm scared. I'm alone. It mixes me up. I don't know what to do next here, Alana. What do I do? Down Oh, down Down Oh, down... How do you unbreak the broke? Down Oh, down... Happy Holidays!!! See you on 10th Jan '19 - Serginho
