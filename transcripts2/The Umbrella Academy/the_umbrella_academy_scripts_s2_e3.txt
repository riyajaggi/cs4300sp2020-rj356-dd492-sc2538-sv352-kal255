I could teach you to shave like a big boy. [sighs] No, I just ran into an old family friend. [soft snoring] You didn't untie him? Was I supposed to?

A storm front? - Sound waves. - Sound waves. [soft beeping] Wow. What... Where are you going? [train horn blows in distance] - [puffing] - [children chattering] [boy 1] Yeah! [boy 2] Yeah! King Kong! [Luther] Allison? [groans] [chuckles] - My bad. - Dipshit. All right. Carry on. [cornstalk snaps] [approaching footsteps] [scoffs softly] Hi, Vanya. Who are you? I'm your brother. I have a brother? Look, you can either stay here and wait for the IKEA mafia to come back to kill you, or you can come with me. Wh... Why are they trying to kill me? 'Cause you're not supposed to be here, Vanya. In Dallas? No. Here, in 1963. Holy shit. Yeah, pretty wild, right? It's good to see your powers are still intact. Let's go. Goddamn sequins drive me nuts. - [flips pedal] - Come on. [sewing machine whirring] There he is. - [dog whines] - Want me to scramble you an egg? You need protein after a run like that. Uh, no, I'm... I'm fine. [Jack] Well, you need to eat something. I need your head in the game for the fight tonight. I got a lot of heavy hitters putting up a lot of dough. [dog whining] Hey. You're up for it, right? What? Yeah, of course. Yeah. You know, just... [sighs] You know people, right? You know, guys in the department? Guys that are good at tracking people down and whatnot? [dog whines] Who needs tracking down? It's just somebody I thought I'd never see again. Turns out maybe she's not gone, maybe I just haven't found her yet. Well, give me a name, I'll see what I can do. Yeah? You sure? Can't have my number-one guy moping around like some sad puppy. [dog whines] Come on, give me a name. [Luther] Thank you, Jack. [Jack] "Hargreeves." What is she, your ex? S... Sorta. Y-Yeah. Sure. [rings bell] Klaus? - Allison. - Oh! [laughs] Allison! - Oh, my God. - [Allison gasping] [laughs] Oh, it's really you. - Oh, my God. Oh, it's been so long. - [Klaus] I thought you were dead. - I thought I was the only one left. - I know. Me too. Oh, God, sit down, sit down. We have so much catching up to do. Yeah. I mean, you want to catch me up on how you ended up in a place like this? Oh... you know, dicks, drugs, debutantes. My holy trinity. [laughs] But, yeah, it's been a wild run. Klaus, you started a cult. "Cult" is a very negative word, Allison. We prefer to call it - "an alternative spiritual community." - [Allison] Mmm... Nope. You definitely started a cult. All right, all right, all right. Enough about me. What about you? - What have you been up to? - Uh, well, I'm living in South Dallas, working as a civil rights organizer. Wow. - With my husband. - [gasping] - [whispers] You're married? - [chuckles] Yeah. Who is this lunatic? [laughs] His name is Raymond Chestnut. Ray. Wait, is he locked up right now? - Yeah. How do you know that? - Yeah, yeah. We did time together. [chuckles] Wow. Small world. We organized a really big sit-in at a lunch counter today. [Klaus] Uh-huh. And then Ray got arrested on some bullshit charge, and... I can't get him out. Hello. Why didn't you just rumor him out? I haven't used my power since... I heard a rumor... [echoing] [Vanya grunts] [Allison] I couldn't speak for a year. [Klaus] Ooh. - Ooh, I'm sorry, Allison. - [Allison] No, it's okay. I actually really like who I am without it. Everything I have, I've earned, and it feels really good. You know? [pedestrians chatter indistinctly] - [door bell jingling] - [tapping loudly] [Handler] Fish don't like people tapping on the glass. - [puppy barks] - [boy] Why not? [birds tweeting] [Handler] It agitates them. Makes them nervous. Life is tough enough being so small... in a world filled with predators... just waiting for some bigger fish to come along and gobble you up. - [chuckles] - What's that on your head? It's called a bullet wound. From what? From getting shot in the head. Is the bullet still in there? [laughs softly] Fragments of it are, yes. Huh. [whispers indistinctly] [door bell jingles] [door shuts, bell jingling] - [low chatter] - [Odessa] All right, Muriel. - We'll see you next week. - [door shuts, locks] How's Ray holding up? Ray is Ray. When's he getting out? I'm working on that. We need to postpone the sit-in. [people muttering] No way. Excuse me? Kennedy arrives in five days. We have to take advantage. We can't wait. [Odessa] I don't know. Something doesn't feel right without Ray. Ray would want us to move forward. [man] Did he say that to you? Those exact words? He didn't have to. Because this movement is bigger than all of us. - Even Ray. - [man] Mmm. I'm calling it. We postpone. [scoffs] [man] We postpone. Why don't we vote on it? We're not voting on it. - Why the hell not? - Because that's not how this works. You trying to tell me how this works? In my own damn beauty parlor? What... you about to start coiffin' hair, too? No, ma'am. I didn't think so. Look, we've been organizing this sit-in for months. When Kennedy gets here, so do the cameras. Now is the time to show the world - what it is really like for us down here. - [murmurs of agreement] And to show the police that we will not be bullied into submission. We will continue to fight for equality, even in the face of persecution. With or without Ray. Because we're ready. All in favor? [Odessa] There it is. "Behind every man..." [people chattering softly] - [phone ringing nearby] - [mutters] Come on. [typewriter clacking nearby] [lights buzzing] [soft squishing] What in tarnation? - [exhales sharply] - [typewriter types slowly] [typewriter clacking nearby] - [Klaus] Don't gloat. - [blows] - Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever. - [Ray] You. You got me out? [Klaus] I told you I had friends in high places. I don't know what to say. [Klaus] Don't say a word. Anything for family, brother. - Well, okay. - [Klaus chuckles] - Yeah! - We are all brothers - beneath the skin. - No. No, literally. You're my brother-in-law. - What? - [chuckles] Yeah, man. Family barbecues are about to get real weird. [laughs softly] Later. Leave the pot, dear. Thank you. Lippy little shit. You gonna tell me what the hell's going on? When you were a baby, you were bought by an eccentric billionaire. He raised you in an elite academy with six other siblings with extraordinary powers, but in the year 2019, in order to avoid the apocalypse, we jumped into a vortex and ended up being scattered throughout the timeline in Dallas, Texas. Any questions? What do you mean, "the apocalypse"? I mean the end of the world as we know it. Yeah, but how? You really don't remember anything? No, nothing before a month ago. Then what do you remember? I landed in, like, a... back alley. Got hit by a car. My head was ringing like crazy. I had no idea how I got there, where I came from. What causes the apocalypse? Asteroid impact. The big kaboom ends everything. Just like the one that got the dinosaurs, except way worse. Bad news is, it followed us here. What do you mean, "followed us"? Eight days from now, the world ends in a nuclear doomsday. It's a different disease, but... same result. That can't be right. I saw it. With my own eyes. [sighs] You were there. We all were. Shit. I need to make a phone call. Vanya. [slow classical music plays on LP] [record skipping] - [screeching] - [faster classical music playing] [Sissy] Oh, God. Let Mama help you, honey. Hey, let Mama help you. It's okay. Here we go. - Okay. - [screeches] - Oh, honey. - Mmm! Honey, just take a deep breath. Deep breath, honey. - Just breathe. Just breathe. - Mmm! - It's okay, babe... - Mmm! Harlan. - Harlan, stop it! - [Harlan] Mmm! Harlan! Harlan, stop it, honey. - Mmm! - Stop it! - [Harlan screeches] - [screams] - [pants] Baby, come on. Relax. I gotcha. - [phone ringing] I gotcha. You're okay. You're okay. You're okay. - Oh, shit. - Mmm! - Okay, here we go. Here we go. - [ringing continues] You're okay. [panting] - Shit. - Mmm. - [phone continues ringing] - [Harlan] Mmm! - Hello? - [Vanya] Sissy? Vanya? Where are you? I'm so sorry I took the station wagon. [exhales sharply] I don't care about the damn car. [gasps, panting] Are you okay? - [Vanya] I'm fine. - What the hell happened? I found my younger brother. [Sissy] What? H-How? It's a long story. Is Harlan okay? [sighs] No, he's... he's... he's not okay. The record player broke, and he just... Just... [sighs] When the hell are you coming back? As soon as I can, I promise. I'm happy you found your real family... - [coin rattles] - [dial tone] - What the hell? - We don't have time for this. That's my friend you just hung up on. Listen to me. [softly] Those people from the field are coming after us. They are never going to stop. Do you understand me? We need to stick together, find the others, figure out how to stop doomsday. Whoever this person is, they can't be more important than the end of the world. We need to go. [faint beeping nearby] [grunts softly] [exhales] You hungry? - Elliott's made moldy tuna. - [Elliott splutters] It's a tuna mold. [Diego] I'll pass. - Where's my shirt? - Where do you think you're going? This is all connected to JFK, and my dad's right in the middle of it. That's why he attacked me last night. [grunting exhale] 'Cause he knows that I'm actually getting closer to... [yells] [grunts] Yeah, you're in such a fit state to fight. You should probably go right now. What is wrong with you? You almost got killed last night. - Take a day off. - [Diego grunts] I can't believe I got shanked by my own father. I know. So rude. Hey, if it's any consolation, he probably didn't know that you were his son when he shanked you. [Diego] Still... he cheap-shotted me. [soft piano melody playing] Man to man, that son of a bitch wouldn't stand a chance. - Of course he wouldn't. [taps skin] - [gasps softly] Why were you following me? [sighs] I thought you were taking off on me. Mmm. What people do. Hey, um... you know, when you were lying there, I... I thought you were dead. That's how I found my parents. Facedown in the living room. It was a home invasion. [whispers] Shit. How old were you? Four. You never talked about that in group. I never talked about that with anyone. If you wanna stay longer... for a bit... I guess that's okay. Yeah? Yeah. Is it okay that I don't hate you like I hate most people? [laughs softly] Yeah. Yeah, that's okay by me. - Jesus! - What the hell do you think you're doing? I don't understand you! [sighs heavily] - Ow. Oh, oh, ow, ow, ow, ow... - Too much? Just... be gentle. Never. [Elliott] Mmm... [inhales deeply] [loud thud] [loud clatter] [sinister instrumental music playing] Don't ever say I never did nothing for you, - you big galoot. - [dog whines] [muffled] You found her? South Dallas. It's a hell of a place. [chuckles] You sure know how to pick 'em.

[Luther] Oh. I'm sorry, I must have the wrong address. I... Who you looking for? Allison Hargreeves. You mean Allison Chestnut. Chestnut? [Ray] My wife. [inhales deeply] Would you mind if I, uh... Knock yourself out. [lid opens] [muffled] I'm sorry, did you want one? [Ray] No, thank you. Allison told me that she had family up north, but... she never mentioned a brother. And she certainly never mentioned a brother that looked like you. I guess we haven't been that close lately. [Ray] Mmm. So you staying here in Dallas? [Luther] I got a room at the Plano Street Rooming House for Solitary Men. [Ray] Oh, yeah? How you like it? Not bad. Clean. Reasonable rates. Good. - Very good. - [Luther] So, uh... how long you been married? Oh, yeah, we're coming up on a year now. That's so great. Yeah. Congratulations. Thank you. [phone rings] [Ray] Hello? What? We're still on? I'll be right there. [hangs up phone] [Ray] Listen, I have got to run. Do you want to leave a message for Allison? [Luther] Would you just tell her that I need to talk to her? Sure. [indistinct chatter] [chatter ceases] [woman] What? [gasps] Out. Else I'm calling the police. I'd like to be served, please. Can't you read, girl? Seven languages. Oh. You a smart one, huh? [door opens] We'd like to be served, please. You are not welcome here. [Ben] The hell are we doing here? S-Some ole DIY? You just stay here, pumpkin. Okay. [Ben] Don't do anything dumb. David? [man] Uh, yeah, can I help you? Dave? Yeah, that's what it says on my name tag, yeah. [exhales sharply] [voice trembles] Look at you, with your... jokes and... your name tag and... Well, can I help you find anything? Uh... [Ben] So this is why we came to Dallas. [Klaus sighs] I... You know, this might be your dumbest idea yet, - and you're pretty dumb. - Just, don't. - You all right, mister? - Yeah. No, I'm... - No, he's not all right. - I'm totally fine. I'm totally fine. - I just, um... - You just what? [sighs, breath trembling] - Paint. - Paint? - Paint? - Yeah, I'm... remodeling the second bathroom and... require some paint. Yeah, s-sure thing. What... What color paint were you looking for? Oh... [sighs] I don't know. [chuckles softly] Eggshell? "Egg... Eggshell." How do you mean, "eggshell"? As in... you know, like, white. Or... Or, like, off-white, - like an eggshell? - We're fresh out of white, but I do have... Mamie pink on special, which always goes very nice in the latrine. That sounds perfect. Is this considered stalking? 'Cause I think you're stalking now. [hissing whisper] Shut up! [levers squeaking] You're pretty good at that. [chuckles] Thanks. [laughs softly] [loud rattling] - [rattling continues] - [helicopter blades thumping, distant] - [overlapping gunfire] - [Klaus] Dave! Dave! Dave! [sobbing] Stay with me, Dave. [whimpers, echoing] Dave... [Dave] All set. - Thanks. - [Dave] You're welcome. [exhaling] Yeah. So this is why you dragged me away from San Francisco, so you could rekindle your little Vietnam fling? Why don't you stay out of my business, Casper? - Your business is my business. - Oh, well, then, congratulations, because you're fired! [starts engine] - This is wrong, Klaus. It's selfish. - [Klaus] Just stop, Ben. - You're just gonna confuse the kid! - Would you stop? Damn it, listen to me. When we were on leave in Saigon, Dave told me about the day he enlisted. It was the same day that Kennedy was murdered. And if you would just please leave me alone for five goddamn minutes, then maybe I could convince him not to sign up to that stupid war and maybe I could save his life! [sighs] God damn it! Ow. [hisses softly] Look... just promise me you can handle this. Whatever happens. Yeah, yeah, I can handle it, I can handle it. [police sirens wailing] Oh, shit. Allison. [overlapping shouts] [woman 1] You don't belong here! Get outta here! - [woman 2] Get them out of here! - [man 1] Get the hell out of here! - What the hell? - What you doing in here, boy? - What the hell? Come on, go! Get out! - Get the hell out! Ray. Oh, you made it. Thank God. I'm sorry I'm late. It's been a very interesting day. [man 2] You can get out! Take my seat. Next shift's about to start anyway. - [overlapping shouts continue] - Get the hell outta here! Get out! Stay the hell outta here! Do you hear us? We don't want you here. Come on! - [grunts] - [crowd groans] [both grunting] [Luther groans] [growls] - [groans] - [Luther grunts] Come on! Come on! [roars] [crowd cheers, shouts] [man] Come on! Get up! [crowd applauding, shouting] [grunts] [crowd roars] [sounds fading] - [Ray, echoing] Who you looking for? - [Luther] Allison Hargreeves. [Ray] You mean Allison Chestnut. My wife. [crowd continues shouting] [heavy grunt] - Let's go! - Come on! - [Luther grunts] - [crowd shouting] What? Look, he's pummeling him. - Hit me again. - The hell are you doing? [opponent growls] - Oh, my God, Luther. - Why isn't he fighting back? [Luther groans] [grunts] [protesters] No more back door! No more back door! No more back door! No more back door! No more back door! No more back door! Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out! - What's wrong? - [chanting continues] I got bailed out of jail today by a very unique character claiming to be my brother-in-law. Okay, that... that's Klaus. - I... I can explain all of that... - And then I come home to find the biggest white boy I've ever seen in my entire life standing on my front porch, trembling like somebody's lost puppy, and the strange thing is, he is also claiming to be your brother. Luther. - That's the one. - [gasps, shrieks] [gasps] - Get your hands off her! - That's it! You're outta here! - [whistle trills] - [grunts, panting] - Ray! - [grunts] - No, no, no, Ray! - Allison! - No, no! - [whistle trilling] - No! - Let her go! Stop it! [officer] Get your hands up! Everybody, hands up! - [blows landing] - [shouts continue] [Ray groaning] Ray! - [Odessa] Take your hands off her! - No, stop it! Stop it! Stop it! - Allison! - [protesters shouting] - Let her go! - No! Allison! We have a right to be here! You let her go! [Allison gasping] No more back door! No more back door! No more back door! [officer over bullhorn] Disperse or you will be arrested. Get your hands off me! [screaming] - [grunts] - [woman screaming] Ray! - [Ray grunts] - [screams continue] Ray! Ray! No! - Stop it! Get off of him! Stop! - [officer] You don't belong in there, boy! - [Allison] No! - You're next! [muted shouts] - Stop it! You're killing him! - [man] Get off her! [echoing] I heard a rumor... that you walked away. [baton clattering] - [crowd shouting chaotically] - [police sirens wailing] - Ray. Are you... Are you hurt? We're okay. - [Ray] What did you say to him? What the hell did you say to him? - Uh... - What the hell did you say to him? - I just told him to leave you alone. - [Ray] There ain't no way in hell that a white cop is just gonna walk away 'cause a black woman tells him to. [coughs] Ray, we don't... we don't have time for this. Come on. We gotta go! Gotta get out of here. - Come on! - Who are you? Ray! Ray! - [coughs] Ray, we... Ray! Ray... - [Ray] Who are you? [coughing] - [Klaus] Allison. - Ray! - Allison, come on. We have to go. - No, no! - I can't leave him! Ray! - [Klaus] Come on! Right now! Ray! [overlapping angry shouts] [panting] Hit me again. [grunting] Again! Hit me! Luther, are you crazy? Just hit him! Come on, Luther! Hit me. I wanna feel pain. I wanna feel all the pain. Give me everything you've got! [growling] [crowd grows quiet] [crowd shouting] [overlapping boos] [angry shouts] Get outta my way. Shit. - Luther. - [Vanya] Why didn't he fight back?
