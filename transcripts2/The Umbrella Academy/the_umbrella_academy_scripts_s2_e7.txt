[women murmur] [sighs] [upbeat polka music continues] [clock ticking] I hate to disappoint you, Benny boy, {\an8}but you are not getting in this body. - No way. - [Ben] Well, you're gonna have to fall asleep eventually. [kisses] {\an8}This is nothing. {\an8}Once, in Rio, {\an8}oh, I spent eight straight days up. {\an8}Without chemical assistance? {\an8}Listen, the point is I'm not gonna let you win. [inhales sharply] God, I hate your face. I hate all of you. [Klaus whispers] Please, just... - [gasps] - [shushing] [softly] It's okay. Fall asleep. - [clock chimes] - [gasps] Hey! Ben! Jesus Christ! Will you please...? Just, look, I'm going through a lot right now. - You're always going through a lot. - Ben-uhh! The love of my life is gonna die, and I can't stop it. I've tried every trick in the time-traveler's playbook. I told him I loved him. I told... I told him his future. And the only thing you succeeded in doing was freaking him out. [Klaus] Oh, God, I hate this. - Not being able to do anything. - Klaus, the way you feel right now is the way I feel every day. All I do is watch you make the same mistakes over and over and over and over and over again. Welcome to powerlessness. Oh, my God. That must suck. I'm sorry. - You wanna make it up to me? - No! - Come on, please! - You cannot possess me. - Just for a few minutes! - No. Why? What's so damn important? Jill. I... [sighs] - I want to talk to her. - Jill... Oh, that's the, um... [clicks tongue] The Moroccan girl with the limp? - Right? - Seriously? We've been over this. I so rarely listen to you. - Klaus! - All right, fine. Okay. - But wait! - Oh! We need to talk about ground rules. {\an8}- [cutlery clinking] - [Sissy] Excuse me, babe. - [Vanya] Thanks. - [Sissy] Mm-hmm. [Zoe Muth's "Give Me A Reason To Stay" plays over radio] ♪ Love you forever... ♪ [switches radio off] You want a beer, Carl? No, ma'am. [Sissy clears throat] I'm taking Harlan in for his checkup. It'd be nice if you came along. Yeah, I'd love that. And we could go to the park after or something? Actually, I need Vanya to give me a ride up to Jim Garvey's ranch. Says he's got a new lead on a client for me. He'll give me a ride back when we're done. Harlan likes when Vanya comes along. Helps keep him calm. You'll come with us. I said I need her. [Vanya] It's okay. I'll go with Carl. Fine. Let's go, babe. [keys jingling] We'll be back in a little while. [door opens] [door closes] Babe, have you seen my green tie? - Where are you going? - I just got off the phone with Miles. Apparently, Robert Kennedy's people reached out from the AG's office. They wanna sit down. Our little protest got their attention. Baby, that... [chuckles] That's amazing. Uh, but I was hoping maybe we could... Miles wants to strategize, get everybody on the same page. Can you believe this? All of our hard work is finally paying off. I'm really happy for you, baby. - Do you wanna come with? - No. No, you go ahead. I'm, um... - not feeling too well. - Oh. Well... I'll be back soon. And I will bring soup. [Ray] Mwah. - Hey, Ray? - Yeah? I love you. [melancholy piano melody plays] [door closes] - [approaching footsteps] - [scoffs softly] [Handler] Well? [gasps] AJ! [cackling] [coos, sighs] You know, you're really starting to fill out those tight little shorts of yours. [giggles] Why so quiet? Thought you'd be buzzing after this morning's slaughter. All this killing... I'm done with it. What? Am I supposed to take that seriously? What I did today, I did for my family. - I did it to save the world. - Please. Spare me your little assassin with the heart of gold routine, will you? Here. Per our agreement, this will get you and your siblings back to 2019. You have 90 minutes. - [clock tolls loudly] - You said nothing about a time limit. Actually, you have 89 minutes and 30 seconds. - Better hurry. - [Five] This is impossible, okay? My siblings are scattered across the city. Nothing's impossible. You proved that this morning when you killed the board. I need more time. Any more time, and people will start asking questions. The sooner you get home and out of this time period, the better off we'll both be, - so, ticktock, ticktock. - [clock ticking, echoing] I can't believe Elliott's dead. - He was a good guy. - [Luther sighs] - Deserved better than this. - Yeah. Elliott must've been getting too close to the truth. It smells like the feds. What? Are you out of your mind? Diego, if this was the federal government, they would take him somewhere and question him. They wouldn't... do this. No, this is the work of a psychopath. "Oga Foroga." That a name? "Oga Foroga." [Luther sniffs] I'll look her up. Okay... [sighs] [Luther] Holy shit, I found her. "Olga Foroga." - [scoffs] That must be her. - Call the bitch. On it. {\an8}- [rotary phone dialing] - [Five sighs] [Luther] Okay... [softly] It's ringing. [sighs, whispers] Damn. Uh, hello, Olga? [whispers] It's her. She sounds old. - What should I say? - Just... [clears throat] Excuse me, ma'am. Um, I was just wondering... What? My name? Is, uh, Luther Hargreeves, and... [Diego] You killed one of ours, Olga, now we're coming after you. You will be dead by nightfall. Hey. It's Öga För Öga, idiots. Swedish for "an eye for an eye." It means the Swedes killed Elliott. Wrong number. Have a lovely day. - [Five sputters] - We would've gotten there. - Eventually. - Yeah. [Five sighs] - Uh, you have some blood on you. - A lot of blood, actually. Five, what did you do? [woman over PA] Attention all Commission supervisors, - please report to the main foyer. - [employees chattering] Attention all Commission supervisors, please report to the main foyer. [approaching footsteps above] [crowd grows quiet] - [screeching feedback] I am... - [crowd gasping] [voice wavers] I am heartbroken to be sharing this devastating news. All 12 members of our board... have been assassinated. [crowd gasps and murmurs] [Handler] I know. I know. A full investigation is underway. We will hunt down the culprits who did this dastardly deed. Grief counseling is available for those of you who need it. Although, the Commission will not be paying for this service as it is considered out-of-network by our insurance provider. - [low murmurs] - [Handler] In the absence of any living board members, it is my solemn duty to assume control - of the Commission. - [softly] How is she in charge? She was demoted. The briefcase room will be closed temporarily as a security precaution. [overlapping whispers] Any questions? [people murmuring] [heels clicking, retreating] So I found a way home. What? How? All the details are irrelevant, but... I made a deal to get back to our timeline. - What about doomsday? - Won't happen. - And the 2019 apocalypse? - Everything will be back to normal. All right? Now, no more questions. We gotta go. [sighs] - We have to find the others, right? - Yeah. Luther, you get Allison. - Okay. - Diego, Klaus. I'll get Vanya. Now, we meet back in the arrival alley in 77 minutes. Here. - I've synchronized these watches. - Okay, let's do this. [Diego] Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on. You show up drenched in blood and expect us to believe everything's gonna go back to normal if we go home now? Elliott just got killed because of us. What about Dad? What about JFK? Diego, we have a chance to go home and make things right. We are taking it. I have to say goodbye to Lila. Lila doesn't give a shit about you, Diego! She never did. She's one of them. She's a member of the Commission. No way. - Not possible. - She was just using you to get to me. You're the Oswald of this story, my friend. - The goddamned patsy. - You don't know what you're talk... If you don't do this, I'll kill you myself. Got it? [Five whooshes away] [Luther sighs heavily] - Women. - [clock ticking, echoing] Am I right? No cutting of the hair. I love my look right now. Second, no touchy-touchy down there. Well... maybe I won't mind, you know, but just don't look, because I'm shy. And finally, I'm dairy-free. Trust me on that. [Klaus sighs] Thank you. [exhaling] Whatever, just... [sighs] Just make it quick. [both exhaling] [Klaus gasping] [shuddering grunt] [Baio's "Sister of Pearl" plays] [exhales sharply] Okay, just focus. Stay focused.

You ever heard of... hoof-and-mouth disease? My paps worked a ranch in California. Around 1924, they had an outbreak. They had to slaughter over 100,000 animals. Devastated the whole area. Paps lost his job. A lot of people did. See, they didn't catch the sick cow in time, so... the disease spread. You gotta fight the disease before it spreads. Before it gets outta hand. Who I am is not a disease. [chuckles softly] Well... call it what you want, but it ain't natural. And it ain't happenin'... under my roof. Not with my wife. I'm not scared of you. Well, that's fine, but... it's Harlan you should be thinkin' about. What do you mean? This situation's not good for him. I've been thinkin' of... sendin' him off for a time. What? Where? Well, to a facility better equipped to handle his type. Be good for him, get some special attention. Come on, that's crazy. 'Course... maybe I wouldn't have to do that with you gone. Harlan could go back to spending time with his mommy and his daddy like he should. [clicks tongue] Now me and Jim gonna have us a drink. So... [chuckles] You take the car. And I do expect you to be packed up and gone by the time I'm back. [Allison] Luther. Five found us a way home, and we leave in... 42 minutes. Wh... 42 minutes? Yeah, listen, I know it's a lot to process, okay? Wait, wait, wait, wait. - What about doomsday? - Five thinks if we leave right now, everything will go back to normal. Are you saying that I could see Claire again? Tonight? I don't know. I don't know what kind of world we're going back to. - I can't guarantee anything. - Luther... [scoffs] I cannot keep losing people. I mean, what if Five gets it wrong again and I lose everyone? We don't belong here. We have to go back. [Allison inhales sharply] [voice trembles] I don't know if I can. Allison... we're different than everyone else. We're special. And good or bad, that means we don't get to live normal lives. Here or anywhere. [thumps counter] It's not fair. [Luther] I know. But we have to risk everything to save everything. I mean, that's our best trait as a family, right? What? Recklessness? [sighs softly] Hope. - [Ray] Baby? - [Allison sighs, sniffles] What's wrong? What the hell did you say to her, Luther? [clock ticking, echoing] [sighs softly] You're different today. Really? How so? [takes deep breath] You're... dorkier. Oh. No, no, I like it. You know, I haven't been able to take my eyes off you since you joined. - I don't believe you. - It's true. You love your garden, you sing to your turnips. You're so good with people. Everybody comes to you for advice, - and you give it so freely, and... - [chuckles] I love the way you tug on your earlobe when you read. - I had to buy a cream for it. - [Ben] I know. [both giggling] Can I... [takes deep breath] Can I smell your hair? Sure. [Ben's breath trembles] - [Ben inhaling deeply] - [Jill sighs] God, you're incredible. - You... You're incredible too. - [both chuckle] Wanna do it? [sighs] - Do what? - Have sex. The holy union of our multiple spirits. [Ben spluttering] - Sure, but, uh... - But what? Uh, there's something you need to know... - [grunts] - Are you okay? Yeah. - Never been better. - Good. - [Jill chuckles] - Jill, you don't... [gasps] You don't know the real me. Oh, yeah? - [whispers] Yeah. - I know everything about you. I have pored myself over your teachings, I have sung your Vedas, I have committed every part of your body - to my memory. - But, Jill, that's not me. I'm somebody different. I'm... a virgin. - What about last week? - Huh? You, me, and Keechie? In the sex swing. We practiced the suspended, extended, four-part unification. - Klaus, you're so filthy! - Yes, you are, Daddy. - Oh... Oh, hey... Oh! - [Jill] Mmm... Wait, just... [moans] [Ben] Oh! Oh! Oh! - Okay! - Hey, Daddy. You got a sec? Diego! Come on, we gotta go. - Yeah. I'll be right back. - Okay. - I promise. - Come on. [Handler chuckles] Hmm! - [AJ, muted] How dare you! - Look at you. [AJ] I'll get you for this! - [shouting indistinctly] - Back at work. And don't worry about that parking spot. It won't go to waste. [cackling] - [AJ] No! [splutters] - Do I really have to be here? Oh, Lila, darling, no, I need your opinion. These are all so good, I can't decide. What do you think of these new security uniforms? Too pansy-ass? Hmm... I am a sucker for a beret, though. Oh, come on, this is my big day. Don't yuck my yum with your bad mood. And stop twisting that tacky little bracelet like a sulky schoolgirl. We have achieved our dream. - Your dream. - Hey. Here. - What is it? - Well, it was meant to be a surprise, {\an8}but your terrible attitude's ruined that. Head of security? You're always asking about more trust, responsibility. Well, there it is. - Really? - Really. - If you want it. - [Lila scoffs softly] Yeah, I want it, but, um... I wanna do it my own way. Yeah, I wanna make my own decisions, you know, pick my own team. Why not? You've earned it. - You need to come with me. - Where? - [woman] Prophet. Prophet. - Five found a way home. [giggles] It's so great to talk to you again, Diego. - You hear what I just said? - Yeah. - Are you high, Klaus? - No, I'm not Klaus. I'm Ben. You are high. - Look, I don't have time for this. - I can prove it. Ask me something only Ben would know. Okay. When we were little, what did you reprogram Allison's Teddy Ruxpin to say? [in singsong] "Luther sniffs Dad's underwear." [chuckles softly] Holy shit. [Ben laughs] [Diego] I don't get it, I mean... - Klaus said you didn't make it to Dallas. - Well, Klaus says a lot of things, but guess what? I can possess him now and it's freakin' awesome. Okay, you can tell me all about it on the way back to 2019. Okay? What about Destiny's Children? We can't just leave them. Klaus should be the one to tell them... Oh, no, no, no, no, no, okay? You stay in this body. We need someone responsible behind the wheel, okay? All right, Diego. Will you wait? I just need, like, ten minutes. - Ten minutes. - Actually, - there's something I need to do first. - [watch ticking] Meet me in the alley behind Elliott's in 30 minutes, okay? - Do not be late. - I won't. - I won't. - Good to see you, brother. [Ben] You too. Bye. [grunts] - [clock ticking, echoing] - Oh, no. [gasps] [both skidding on gravel] - [Vanya] What are you doing here? - Looking for you. - We're going back to 2019. - What are you talking about? Look, I don't really have time to explain right now, but I found a way home. All right? We have 30 minutes to leave. What about my friends? I can't just leave them here. Vanya, you don't have a choice in this, all right? Doomsday will happen if you don't come with me. Okay, then I'm bringing them with me. - They belong in this timeline. - Says who? Sissy deserves a life where she doesn't have to pretend to be someone she's not. And Harlan? There's a name for what he has. We can get him the help he needs. Vanya. Look, a mom and her eight-year-old son are not gonna screw up the timeline, Five! - They're insignificant. - No one is insignificant. I'm sorry, all right? But we can't take that risk. They have to stay. Come on. Why do you get to decide? You're the reason we're stuck here in the first place. If I did nothing, we would all be dead right now, thanks to you. They're coming with me. [scoffs softly] Vanya, do not test me right now. That's funny. 'Cause I was just about to say the same thing. [high-pitched tone resonating softly] [Five's power whooshing rhythmically] [both powering down] Fine. - "Fine," what? - I'll be there, - but I need to say goodbye first. - Oh, Vanya, we don't have the time. Well, it's either that or I'm not coming. [scoffs] [Five] The alley. Don't be late. [sighs] - [muttering] - [Vanya's car starts] [clock ticking, echoing] Oh, good. It's you and your stupid face. [Lila] Weird time to garden. - Can we talk? The truth this time. - [Diego] Oh, I know the truth. You used me, Lila. You're a liar. - Oh, come on. What did I really lie about? - [Diego] Who you are, who you work for, why you're here, what you want from us. That's all. Yeah, but the rest was true. Everyone lies, Diego, and... and I was only lying to protect you. Mostly. Do you know how hard it is to trust people when your whole childhood was bullshit manipulation? [Lila] Uh-huh. Then why would you do that to me? Tell you what, I'm gonna finish this hole... [grunts] ...save the world, and forget we ever met. [grunts] [soft piano melody playing] Wait, is that... is that dentist-chair guy? Elliott. - Your Swedish buddies got him. - Oh, shit. I liked that shit-muppet. Well, here's to Elliott, I guess. Um... I'll miss his crazy theories... [Diego continues digging] And I'll miss sharing his bed with you. - [flask clinks] - We done now? [piano music slows, goes off-key] [Diego] Oh... [distorted] ...balls. Yup. [clock ticking, echoing] [Ray] How much time do we have? [Ray's breath trembling] [Allison sniffles softly] Twenty-three minutes. Twenty-three minutes? There has to be another way. Look, I... [sniffling] I know it's crazy, but if I asked, would you come with me? You want me to leave Dallas? You want me to leave the movement? The movement's not finished. Not even in 2019. Yeah, but you said that the work we're doing here, - it has an impact. - No, it does. It does. Well, babe, I just can't leave it behind. My part of the fight is right here. [Allison sniffles] [sobs softly] [sniffles] I can rumor you. - Take the pain away. - No. We're not gonna do it like that. I don't wanna forget you. I don't wanna forget us. I would take my year with you over a lifetime with anybody else. You hear me? I'm still the luckiest man I know. [chuckles] [Allison whimpers] [knocking at door] I'm sorry, now is not a good time. [gasps, choking] - What's going on? - [panting] This is it. We're leaving. [Sissy] Well... - where are we going? - To a better place, okay? I promise I'll explain when we get there. - What about Carl? - No. We need to leave before Carl gets back. - I need to talk to him first. - There isn't time. - He's my husband. I owe an explanation. - You don't owe him! - I need to leave him a note. - He knows about us, Sissy! He threatened to send Harlan away to an institution. We need to go, and we need to go right now. No note. No goodbye. This is it. [Sissy inhales sharply] Harlan? [exhales shakily] Harlan? - We're going on a drive, okay? - Yeah. Here, Harlan, let's go. [Sissy] Here. Okay. [Vanya] Let's get to the car. Oh, shit! The coffee can. You get Harlan in the car. - Yeah. - I'll just be a sec. [car starts outside] [gasping] - Oh. - [clock ticking, echoing] [sighs] [panting] [continues panting] Hey, uh, Prophet, Prophet, where you going? Uh, quick vision quest. Be back in a few years. Maybe. Well, wait, wait, wait! Who will bless the pool waters? You can do it, Keechie. You can do everything from now on. No, Prophet, I can't. Keechie, bless the water, bless the air, bless the sex swing for all I care. Would you just do me one favor? Yes, of course, Prophet, anything. Tell Jill that rollin' in the dirt was the greatest moment of my life. Uh... Prophet, wait! - [groans] - Any last words of wisdom before you go? [splutters softly] "Oh, my God, we're back again.
