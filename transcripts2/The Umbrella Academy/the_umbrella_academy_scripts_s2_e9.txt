 Vanya's in the room at the end of the hall. - How do you propose we get to her? - I haven't figured that one out yet. - You can count me out. - Klaus! What? You guys should save her. You're great at all the hero shit. - Oh, Klaus! - Listen, listen. Vanya would understand 'cause she has realistic expectations of what I am. And what I am is sexy trash. - You're a big pussy, that's what you are. - Guys, now is not the time. Why? Because I don't wanna die? Who does? And martyrs aren't around to enjoy the victory party 'cause they're dead!

 - You are going out there... - I'm not! Go away! Or I'm gonna beat you, - and not the way you like it! - That's my cue. - Hey! Allison! - No! Allison! Vanya! Vanya! All right. I'm going. - No, wait, wait, wait, wait. - What? If you don't make it back, there's one thing that I need to tell you. - I don't have time for this. - Please. What? You look like Antonio Banderas with the long hair. I just thought you should know. Thanks, man.

 Klaus! I'm not gonna make it! It's up to you, buddy! You gotta save the world! No, Diego, that's a terrible idea! Okay, Klaus. You can do this. You fought in Vietnam. You survived a family of seven. And you once wore a sarong to a fraternity party and got a shitload of numbers. {\an8}All right, just be cool {\an8}till I finish the job on the grassy knoll. {\an8}We'll get the time math and I'll ice the squirt. {\an8}I just wish there was another way, you know? {\an8}- There isn't. Look at him. - What are you looking at? {\an8}- Look. - See something funny? {\an8}Worst case of paradox psychosis I ever seen. Eh... What's wrong? - Well, I... feel bad for him. You know? - Mind your business! - Or I'll give you something to stare at. - He's just a little guy. Everybody's a little guy to you. - You wish you could pull off these shorts! - You look like King Kong and the Hitler Youth had a baby. Luther, I... I don't have time for you to tuck and squeeze here. Can I count on you to keep him under control? - Yeah, I'll do my best, yeah. - All right. Hey, brother. How you doing? - He's gonna kill me, isn't he? - What? What, him? He's gonna kill you? Yeah, right. That's ridiculous. You know, you're a terrible liar, Luther. You're a worse liar than you are a spotter. Okay, whose fault is that? What good is having a spotter if you won't even listen to him? So you admit you're conspiring against me? Do... Do you admit that you're suffering from paradox psychosis? All I'm suffering from is bracing clarity about you and your murderous intentions. Look, it's not like he's gonna "kill you" kill you. He just wants to kill a, um... - version of you. - But I am that version of me. Hey, I don't love it, either, but he's actually got a pretty good plan. What? The one where you guys off me and then jump to 2019 to save the world? Yeah, wait, how did you know that? Because I'm him, and that is exactly what I would do - if I were trying to kill me! - Okay, all I know is we've got one Five too many, - and you're the one acting like a maniac. - Maniac? Luther, you have seen nothing. If you want a maniac, I will show you maniac. Okay, as your spotter, I think the best thing I can do for you right now is put you out of your misery. Okay, Luther, listen. I know your feeble mind only responds to age and authority, so listen very closely. Yet again, you are experiencing daddy issues, this time with your own brother, which honestly is making me a bit crazy. But remember this: I'm 14 days older than him. I have seniority here. So it is me you should be listening to, Luther. I'm the daddy here! How's it going? Five, please, you're being unseemly. Look at you. I admit there is a possibility that I may not be in my fully... - right mind right now. - Okay, good. - But whatever I've got, he's got it too. - What? You two quit grab-assing. We're here. Flatulence. Stage four. See? What's your plan now, bucko? That was just lunch, all right? Shut up. Careful. I want that hem straight enough to cut throats. Hmm. Nice frock. Is this a swearing in or a... a coronation? How's your new hire working out? I heard he lasted all of ten minutes in orientation before he started running amok. Oh, you know boys. He's probably around here somewhere eating a... a very large sandwich. Mm-hmm. Herb! Tell Lila what you told me. I, uh, didn't actually offer it up. You put a knife to my throat. Go on. Diego commandeered the Infinite Switchboard, then hijacked a briefcase... and left the Commission. Told you. He also held a knife to my throat. I knew he was a grifting little gonad. So, what are you gonna do about him? Me? Your puppy, your responsibility. Or are you forgetting our little agreement? You only let him stay hoping I'd have to kill him. Hmm. Was this all a test? Everything is a test, darling. The question is... Why are you failing it? I'm not failing. Let me handle it my way. Does your way include decapitation? Quartering, boiling, thumbscrews, burning at the stake, or Chinese water torture? I wanna let him go. Peons... out. Darling, blood is thicker than water, but... you can drown in either, Lila. I am officially about to become the most powerful woman in time, and you will be my right hand. But I need to know... that I can trust you... at all times... in all ways. You can. 740... 41... 42... 743. Okay. Oh. Harlan? What's wrong, baby? How do I help you? - Please, I don't know what to do. - Jesus. - What the hell happened? - No, I just found him this way. Vanya. Vanya? Oh, my God. Oh, Harlan. What the hell did she do to our boy? Carl! Carl, what are you doing? Something I should've done a long time ago! - Carl, no! - Time to get him the help he needs! Carl! No, he doesn't belong in one of those places! Hold on, Harlan. Gonna get you some help. No matter what your mama says. All right... Get out of the car. Sissy, don't be a fool. You aren't gonna take my son from me. They'll never give him back. Well, maybe you don't deserve him anymore. Maybe you should watch how you talk to me for once. The timeline is your lifeline. Uh... All right, sweaty gerbil man. Tell me where Diego went or I'll staple your colon to your nose and let you die on your own farts. That's... so... vivid. Wait, wait, wait, wait! No, no, no! I'm on your side. No, I helped him escape. If you... Escape? Well, he was supposed to stay here with me. Where did he go? Back to help his family. Are you really going to kill him? Of course not. I love him. Oh, that's... - Oh! - Say a word and I'll crush you. I won't. I swear, I won't. Uh, wait. I hate to rain on your parade, but there's something I have to show you. Something big. - Ugh! - Wait, no. It's... It's this. Oh, my God. the Dallas-Fort Worth area broadcast, here to bring you a special description of the arrival of President John F. Kennedy. - At this moment, three special... - This is my favorite part. The calm before the storm. Look. The briefcase. No, don't. You won't be able to get there in time. Of course I will. This is our only chance. Hey, uh, just remind me... what was the final stage of paradox psychosis again? Homicidal rage. Right. That's great. Five, listen to me. I... No. No! Oh... shit. Bad idea, shit-heel. Stop it! All right? The both of you. Pull it together. Now, Kennedy is gonna be coming around that corner any minute. Okay? So, everyone, let's just take a deep breath... Now, we're all family here, okay? So can we all just try to get along for a few more minutes? You want it? Go ahead. What's that? Shit. - Now... - Where were we? Come on, sweetie. We'll be late for the parade. Would you please... Hey! I'm getting really sick of this! Vanya? Vanya? Do you remember me? I remember everything. And I'm doing it again, aren't I? What's wrong with me? Why can't I control myself like the rest of you guys? It's not too late. You can go back. There's still time. I don't deserve to live. I killed Pogo. I almost killed Allison. I destroyed the world. I'm a monster. Dad treated you like a bomb before you ever were one. He was... so scared of your power, he never let you use it. Drugged you up, kept you numb for years. That's messed up, Vanya. No wonder you couldn't control it. Dad couldn't handle your anger. That doesn't mean you can't. And maybe you have a right to be pissed off and sad and messed up, but... ...it's a shitty world full of shitty people sometimes. You aren't a monster. You're my sister. And right now, our siblings are risking everything out there trying to save you. You aren't alone at the table anymore, Vanya. You can do this. Ben, what's happening to you? I can't go back with you. What do you mean? - I'm hurting you, aren't I? - It's not your fault. I've been holding on as long as I can in here, but... - You shouldn't have come for me. - Vanya... I died 17 years ago. All the rest of this... these years with Klaus... it's all been gravy. At least this time I get to say goodbye. - Can I ask you a weird favor? - Anything. Can you hug me as I go? It's been a long time since... Tell Klaus something for me, will you? Get out of the car. Whatcha gonna do, Sissy? You gonna shoot me? I don't wanna hurt you, but you need to give me back my boy. Well, he's our boy. Maybe you and Vanya have forgotten that. - Vanya's got nothin' to do with this. - Oh, really? Well, we were just fine till that Russian she-devil showed up. We weren't "fine," Carl. Jesus. Sayin' a lie over and over doesn't make it true. What? You love her? Is that it? Some girl from nowhere? Probably a Communist, who you hit with your car. Yeah, Carl. I love her. So you should just let me go. I did right by you! I worked hard. I was faithful. I never blamed you for the boy. I stayed! You don't get to ask for more than that. I'm askin', Carl. Just not from you. Harlan, baby, you get in the house now, you hear? Boy, you come here. Better he sees who his mama really is. - How she wants to break up the family. - You leave him be. This is between us. Harlan... Harlan, it's okay, baby. It's okay... No! You okay? Oh! Oh, Harlan. Oh, shit. "...take this institution to the heights it reached..." My parents didn't die in a robbery. They were executed. Kill order 743. And I know who did it. Five killed my family. - No, don't kill us! - No! And AJ Carmichael gave the order. It was him who made me an orphan. Darling. Little one... your family is right here. Yeah. I wonder... if that's what Diego was sneaking around here looking for. Trying to bury the evidence so you'd never find out. What... What're you talking about? Diego doesn't know what Five did. Darling, I'm gonna need you to be a titch more clever about this. That clown school that Five calls "Umbrella Academy," it may be full of assholes, but it's not full of fools. They'refamily. What one knows, they all know. No, no, no, no. I... I was playing Diego, he wasn't playing me. Is that why you're crying in my office while he's out roaming free, laughing at you? I didn't think he was smart enough to pull this off. He isn't... but Five is. And Diego listens to him and trusts him. Five... has been playing puppet master all this time. I'd say it's time that we solved this problem... once and for all. Did you enjoy the show, you little flotsam? I don't know how you did it, but I know your work. I'm sure you think you're very clever. The thing about fish, AJ, is they're no match for a shark. Getting tired yet? I can do this all day. - Guys, this has to stop. - Eat shit, Ape Man. Hey! Assholes! I'm done listening to you both. I'm in charge now. - Now, Luther! Shoot him! - No! Luther, shoot him! - Shoot him! - No, Luther, shoot him. Luther, shoot him! Luther, shoot him. Now, Luther! - Luther... - I'm sorry, buddy. Now! Open the portal! Right. - Are you okay? - Vanya. Physically or emotionally? You're alive. - Did we save the world or what? - I think so. Building's still here. Kennedy's a few minutes away. - I can't still save him. - No, Diego, wait! President Kennedy arrives... I still time to stop Dad before Kennedy makes his final turn. No, no, where are you going? Look, I saw the explosion. I saw the tapes, Allison. The explosion causes doomsday. You're safe now. - He doesn't have to die. - No, no, Diego... are Governor and Mrs. Connally. They have stayed in the limousine. But the president, the First Lady, the vice president, and Mrs. Lyndon Johnson are all walking along the edge of this fence, shaking hands with the crowd. And they are being greeted by placards of varying emotional and, uh, political feeling... Don't even think about it. - Into the vortex you go, asshole. - Fine! But give me the math. So I don't end up looking like Tiger Beat over here. You stand next to the vortex and I'll tell ya. Go! - Closer! - This is close enough! Now give it to me! It was a typo. Typo? We put the decimal in the wrong spot in our proof of the existence of a bound for the number of limit cycles of planar polynomial vector fields of fixed degree. We wrote down five-point-seven. It should be... ...zero-point-five-seven. Son of a bitch. I knew that didn't look right. All right... I guess this is it. This is it. Go. No! Five! It's shrinking! The crowd yells. And there's the president of the United States. We did it! I can see his suntan all the way from here. The briefcase, you idiot. What? Hey, you know what? A thank-you for preserving - your existence would be nice. - "A thank-you." And here they come. The presidential car is moving out... Luther! Luther! Here he comes! Kennedy's turning. Look, there's Dad. What do we do? - Uh-oh. - Yeah. - Agh. - Oh, shit. Diego. - It's happening again. - Oh, Jackie. No! KLIF bulletin, from Dallas, three shots reportedly were fired at the motorcade of President Kennedy today, near the downtown section. - KLIF News is checking out the report. - We will have further... Where the hell is he? This is a sad time for all people. We have suffered a loss... that cannot be weighed... Someone even notified him. Oh. - Congratulations. - And to you. I know that the world shares the sorrow that Mrs. Kennedy... Ah, you made it. - Were you followed? - Of course not. I used the decoy. Excellent. - Champagne? - There's nothing to celebrate. Well, clearly, you haven't heard the news. Our little Kennedy problem is solved. He was not to be touched! That was the deal. Well, he had to go, one way or the other. Pissed off too many people. You lied to me. We all got what we wanted. The rocket technology you supplied us with will enable us to beat the Russians to the moon. And in turn, when we do arrive, five or six years from now, your interests on the dark side of the moon won't be affected. Worthy of celebration... don't you think? You will never contact me again. Good night, gentlemen. Don't be too sure of that, Reg. You're gonna keep giving us that fancy technology of yours. And why would I do that? Because if you don't, we'll tell the world who you really are. Uh-oh. Someone's ready for a fight. What's he doing? Oh, my God! "This is the start of something bigger than yourselves, and I will be the ne..." Now is not a good time. What? - Well? - I've never seen anything like this. The anomaly is off the charts. Have you shown this to anyone else? - N-No, only you. - Mmm. Oop. Recall all personnel from the field. We're going to war.
