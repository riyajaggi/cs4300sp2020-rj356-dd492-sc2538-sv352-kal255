 [foreboding instrumental music plays] [overhead lights buzzing] [sighs softly] [clock ticking steadily] [lock buzzes] - [indistinct chatter] - [office phone ringing] - [typewriter clacking] - [door lock buzzes] I'm Special Agent Willy Gibbs of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Where's Sissy? I need to talk to her. [recorder whirring softly] Mrs. Cooper and the boy have been released back into the custody of Mr. Cooper.

 What's your last name, Vanya? Hargreeves. Do you have any ID that could attest to that? No driver's license, birth certificate? - You from around here? - No. I'm... I, uh... I'm... I'm not sure. You're not sure. Well, I told the other officer I was hit by a car. - I have amnesia. - Right. Yes, amnesia. They told me about that. So how does that work, exactly? I can't remember anything from before a month ago. Except your name, of course. Yeah, except my name. [Gibbs] Far as I can tell, it's like you simply...

 materialized out of thin air. Welcome to my world. "Vanya." That's a Russian name, isn't it? I'm not Russian. If you have amnesia, how can you say for sure? In fact, I'm curious as to how you know your first and last name - but you don't remember anything else. - I don't know. - How did you send those troopers flying? - I'm sorry, I don't know. [in Russian] What are you doing here in Dallas? [in Russian] I don't know! [Gibbs] Hmm. [in English] You speak Russian. - I... I don't... I... - [Gibbs] Wonderful. - I must've just learned a little as a kid. - [Gibbs] A little? I think you speak it very well. What I want to know is, how does a young woman who says she isn't Russian, but speaks Russian, end up working as a nanny to some simple-headed boy in the middle of nowhere, Texas? I need to make a phone call. I have the right to make a call, don't I? If there is one thing the FBI takes seriously, it is a Communist threat to this country. Now, I want answers, real answers, and I will do whatever it takes to get them. You're not going anywhere until I find out who you really are. [high-pitched tone resonating, building] [Gibbs grunting softly] [Gibbs gasping] [struggling grunts continue] - [Vanya crying out] - [Gibbs grunting loudly] [Vanya groaning] [Gibbs straining] [grunts, panting] [Gibbs groans, clears throat] {\an8}[Luther] Now what? {\an8}[Five] Now nothing, Luther, all right? {\an8}- Make your peace with God. - [Luther] What? {\an8}What about Allison and Vanya? {\an8}[Five] Screw them both. They should have been here. {\an8}[Klaus groans] What about Diego? {\an8}- He's quite a responsible young man, no? - [Five grunts, sighs] {\an8}- Something must've happened to them. - Screw Diego, all right? Screw everybody! I was better off on my own in the apocalypse. Five! Come on. You know what, Luther? It's every sibling for himself now. How 'bout that? - [door opens, slams shut] - [Klaus sighs] [whimpering] Did Five just get meaner? Klaus, go check on Allison, okay? Make sure she's okay. Find the others and we'll meet back here. I'll handle Five. [Klaus grunts, sighs] And you, you have had your possession privileges revoked. - I regret nothing. - [Klaus sighs] - Just stay out of me. - I regret nothing! [Klaus] Back off! Hey! Five, doomsday is still coming. - We gotta think of a new plan. - Don't you get it, Luther? - It's over, all right? We're already dead. - Then where are you going? I'm going to do the unthinkable. - The hell is that supposed to mean? - [sighs] I was really hoping it wouldn't come to this. Come to what, Five? Five. - [door locks] - Five! Come to what? Five! [Ray] Oh, sweet Jesus, what the hell are we gonna do? - It's okay, it's okay. Calm down, Ray. - Calm down? Allison, you killed a vacuum cleaner salesman in our goddamn living room. [Allison] Okay, technically, his brother killed him. And they were not here to sell vacuums. There is a giant dead white boy on our couch. Yeah, you know, I'll admit, that doesn't look good. Oh, we're done. The movement is finished, Allison. They're gonna give me the chair for this. - They're not gonna give you the... - [knocking at door] [voice trembles] Okay. Okay. [door unlocks] Hey, Ray-Ray. I'm so sorry it's late, but, uh... Klaus, now is not a good time. [Klaus] Oh, I'm sorry. Allison! Hey! I was so worried about you. Thank God you're okay. What's, uh... What's the matter? You guys have been wrastling in here or something? - [Allison sighs] - [Klaus] Oh. Oh, I see. It's gonna be one of those kinda nights, huh? So, are we burnin' or buryin'? [cats meowing] [Allison, echoing] I heard a rumor... you killed your brother. - [shouts] - [choking] [gasps] [inhales deeply] [exhales slowly] [inhales, growling] [breathes in sharply] - [shrieks] - [cats yowling] [metallic clanking] [suspenseful instrumental music plays] [cat meows] [inhales deeply] [inhaling] [in Swedish] Lavender. [in Swedish] Lavender. - [shouts] - [cat yowls] - Are you kidding me? - You said I could hire my own team. Yes, but I didn't mean him, for God's sake. If you don't see the problem with hiring you-know-who's brother, then you're not ready for that badge. I'm sorry, but I really need to get going. [both] Shut up! I can't do this job if you don't trust my instincts. Sweetheart, your vagina needs glasses. He is not worth it. Mum! Oh, my God. This may shock you, but not everyone here likes you. Sounds ridiculous, but go on. You need fresh blood loyal to us and not the old regime. I've seen Diego in the field. He is so much better trained than most of the assholes here. Why waste that when we can use it? He'll be my personal responsibility. You know, your brother Five and I... we have quite... a colorful history. - [lighter flicks, lights] - My brother has beef with everybody, me included. [Handler] Let me ask you something. When you're looking down the barrel of a gun, where do your loyalties lie, with your family or your principles? With me. I don't belong to anybody. Especially Lila. [Handler] That I can work with. Run him through orientation, fill out his start paperwork. But... if he ruffles even one feather, you will kill him yourself. - Understood? - Thanks, Mum. - [crickets chirring] - [door opens inside] [suspenseful instrumental music plays] [exhales softly] [hinges creak softly] [Grace gasps softly] [exhales sharply] Oh, my God. [Reginald] What are you doing in here? [Grace chuckles nervously] Not sure what I could say that would... overwrite the obvious. Fair enough. New question, then. Why are you doing it? Are you involved in somethin' nefarious? Quite often. Did you have something more specific in mind? That... That shaggy man at the consulate, the one who chased after us with the little boy. - Calls himself Diego. - Yes, that's the one. He... He thinks that you want to harm the president. I see. You take the word of lunatics these days? Not over yours, but these... these photographs, they're all about the president's visit tomorrow, aren't they? You know there are aspects of my work I cannot discuss. You've always respected that line. I don't need to know the details, Reggie. I just need to know that you're not involved in what I'm afraid you might be. What are you really afraid of, my dear? There's so much about you I don't understand. I could say the same about you. I want to share my life with you, Reggie, but I need to know you're a good man. I need to know you would never hurt the president. As I said, there are elements in my life that I can't discuss with you. Someday... I hope to share it all with you. Until then... I'm asking you to trust me. [sobs softly] I can't wait that long. I'm sorry. - [refrigerator opens] - [soft rattling] [grunts softly] Five? [splutters, groans] [Luther mutters] Shit. Five? Five, what... You okay? [Five slurping] [gasping heavily] - I'm gonna need to be hydrated. [sighs] - Hydrated? What's with the baby powder? It'll help with the itching. What itching? There's itching? What the hell is going on here? You do have a plan. [Five exhales sharply] Well, it's a desperation move, but... since our brain-dead siblings are incapable of meeting a simple deadline, I got no choice. - No choice about what? - I have to find myself. [flicks watch open, shut] I just arrived in Dallas 15 minutes ago. - Should I be worried about you? - Luther, if you recall, I was sent to 1963 on a job by the Commission to make sure the president was assassinated. Oh! So, wait, you're old self is out there. Precisely. [exhales] What, just walking around Dallas? Walking around Dallas with a briefcase that can get us home. Oh, my God. Five, you're a genius. However, there are two significant problems with this plan. Problem number one: I am a trained assassin, arguably the most dangerous assassin in the space-time continuum. If I know me, I'm not going to react kindly to bumping into myself. Problem number two, and this is the real fly in the ointment here: you're not supposed to exist in close proximity to yourself in the same timeline. The side effects can be disastrous. Side effects? What sort of side effects? Well, according to Commission Handbook Chapter 27, subsection 3b, the seven stages in paradox psychosis are... stage one: denial, two: itching, three: extreme thirst and urination, four: excessive gas, five: acute paranoia, six: uncontrolled perspiration, and seven: homicidal rage. - Homicidal rage? - [Five] Yeah. [Luther] Jeez, I don't know. This maybe isn't such a good idea. [Five] It's a Hail Mary. But what choice do we got, Luther? I don't know, you already seem a bit squirrelly if I'm being honest. [Five] Look, Luther, I'm gonna need you to help me get through this one, all right? I... I need a spotter. - A spotter? - Yeah. What is that? Like, a wingman? In case the paradox psychosis gets too severe, I need you to help me stay on task, all right? So, whatever happens, whatever I say, we need to get that briefcase. - Okay? - Okay. Okay. - Luther, come on. - Right. [Carl] So, they're questioning her now? Well, I appreciate it. Yup. Take care, now. [places phone on cradle] [Carl] That was my brother. Well, I hope you thanked him for almost arresting me. He says I was right. Right about what? [Carl chuckles softly] The FBI thinks Vanya may be some kind of KGB agent. That's impossible. - [scoffs] - We were both duped, Sis. There's no shame in it. Whatever she is, she's not who she was pretending to be. It's not your fault. She led you astray. That's what these commie bastards are trained to do. They prey on our weaknesses. Turned us against each other. Can't let 'em win. What would a Russian agent be doing out here on a farm? Well, who knows? Maybe she was just looking for a place to hide out. We don't know the big picture. Now look here, I think you should have a talk with Reverend Moore. - Carl... - We need to work through this, damn it. Then we're gonna take us a trip. Somewhere far away from here. That'd be nice, wouldn't it? Harlan needs a family, not a nanny. [Gibbs] Vanya, wake up. Open your eyes. I just have a few questions for you. - It's all gonna be over soon. - [Vanya grunts] [struggling gasps] - What are you doing to me? - Move again and you'll regret it. - [feet splashing in water] - [jerks handcuffs] - [electricity surges] - [shuddering grunts] [powers down] See? And that was the lowest voltage. Only goes up from there. - [Vanya panting] What is that? - [Gibbs] Now, just relax. What is that? [Gibbs] Don't struggle. Go with it, or this can turn into an extremely unpleasant experience for you. [Vanya inhales deeply] [Butthole Surfers' "Pepper" plays] [exhales slowly] [inhales deeply] Now, let's start with a simple question. [echoing] Who are you? [echoing] ♪ Marky got with Sharon And Sharon got Cherese ♪ ♪ She was sharing Sharon's outlook On the topic of disease ♪ ♪ Mikey had a facial scar And Bobby was a racist ♪ ♪ They were all in love with dyin' They were doin' it in Texas... ♪ [in Russian, echoing] Who are you? ♪ ...Then he lost his leg in Dallas He was dancin' with a train ♪ ♪ They were all in love with dyin' They were drinkin' from a fountain ♪ ♪ That was pourin' like an avalanche Comin' down the mountain ♪ ♪ I don't mind the sun sometimes ♪ ♪ The images it shows ♪ ♪ I can taste you on my lips ♪ ♪ And smell you in my clothes... ♪ [Reginald, in Russian, echoing] Number Seven.

You're late for supper. ♪ Another Mikey took a knife While arguing in traffic ♪ ♪ Flipper died a natural death He caught a nasty virus ♪ ♪ Then there was the ever-present Football player rapist ♪ ♪ They were all in love with dyin' They were doin' it in Texas... ♪ Sit down. ♪ ...Well, it should've been a better shot And got him in the head ♪ ♪ They were all in love with dyin' They were drinkin' from a fountain ♪ ♪ That was pourin' like an avalanche Comin' down the mountain ♪ [Gibbs echoes] Come on, Vanya, who are you really? Where did you come from? - [lively Irish jig playing] - [patrons chattering] Well, there I am. Why don't we just grab the briefcase and run? Luther, I would never let that happen. We're trained to guard these briefcases with our lives. - Right. - [Five] Plus, it's the inherent paradox where this gets tricky. I'm endangering my existence just being in the room with myself. - Huh... What do you mean? - Luther, try to keep up. If old me doesn't travel back to 2019 like he's supposed to, the whole thing unravels itself. I cease to exist. You got me? I get you. So our best chance is to talk with him, - to reason with him. - [Luther] Ah. He'll understand. Trust me. I know myself better than, uh... better than I know myself. You just itched your neck. - That's stage two of paradox psychosis. - No, I didn't. I didn't itch my neck. Denial is stage one. I am fine, okay? Let's stay on task, shall we? Wait! - What? - Maybe I should go first. - Why? - Well, you'll freak him out. Bumping into your own tiny doppelganger? He will lose his shit. Just let me break the ice. - Okay. - Okay. [Five breathes deeply] [Luther exhales slowly] Five. What'd you call me, big man? It's me. Number One? Luther. - How did you...? - [Luther] It's okay. Everything is fine. I can explain. But first, I need to introduce you to somebody. Just... promise me you won't freak out. - What the hell are you talking about? - Uh! Don't freak out. No freak-outs. All right. Hey there, stranger. [Lila] It's a really big place. Do not get lost. [Diego] Or what? You'll kill me? [Lila] Oh, you still mad about that, you big baby? [Diego] No, I love being drugged and kidnapped and threatened with murder. [Lila] Okay, well, let's just make sure you're the best agent possible, and no one has to worry about who kills who, okay? - Wait, Lila, I need to get outta here. - Relax. - No, I do not have time for this now. - We have all the time in the world. [gentle chime over speakers] [woman over PA] The timeline is your lifeline. - What is it you people do here, exactly? - [Lila] Oh, that's the best part. We protect the timeline. You know all that lone wolf superhero shit? Tiny taters compared to what you could do here. Hold up, tiny taters, so the Commission controls time? Wait, like, everything in time? Or more like we maintain the correct timeline, but, basically, yeah. How the shit do you do that? Well, come on, I'll show you. - [Lila] Dropping off a new recruit. - [instructor] Welcome to orientation. Take this. - [Diego] Wait a second... - [Lila] Okay. Open your welcome package and grab a seat. All questions will be answered at the end of the film. - [Diego] How long is this? - Sit your ass down. [gentle chime over speakers] [woman over PA] A better tomorrow comes from an orderly today. Uh... I really need this to work, so... don't screw it up. Okay, bye. - [film reel whirring] - [upbeat instrumental plays on film] Oh, hi there. I'm Mr. Briefcase. If you're watching this presentation, that means you've made the best decision of the rest of your life. - You've decided to join the Commission. - [snorts] Over the next 90 minutes, I'm gonna do my best to show you around this old place. You and I are gonna have some fun together. Here at the Commission, you'll find a wide array of exciting career opportunities just waiting to be discovered. Which department will be right for you? Analyst: keeping us informed. Operations: keeping us safe. Hiyah! Infinite Switchboard operator: the key to everything we do here. In these rooms, we monitor the entire timeline and report any anomalies we see along the way, keeping the correct timeline - at all times. - [soft snoring] Whatever your skill, education, or comfort level with moral ambiguity, the Commission has an exciting career path in store for you. Let's start with the tube room... - [lively Irish jig playing] - [indistinct chatter] [Luther sighs] Well... this is nice, isn't it? The three of us, together like this. [both Fives] No. Somebody explain to me how it is I'm having a pint of Guinness - with my younger self. - Older, actually. I'm you, just 14 days older. I have pubic hair smarter than you. - How's that possible? - [teen Five] I can explain. You see, one hour from now, on the grassy knoll, before the president is killed, you break your contract with the Commission. I already know you're thinking about it. All those years in the apocalypse, we never stopped worrying about our family. Well, today, you are going to do something about it. Today, you are going to attempt to time travel forward to 2019. However, you are going to screw up the jump and end up in this twip of a body, trapped forever, small, pubescent. Okay. [farts] Even if I was to believe you, what am I supposed to do about it, - not jump? - [teen Five] No, no. I need you to jump. If you don't jump, I cease to exist. What I need from you is to jump correctly. - I'm listening. - The first time through, I got the calculation wrong. That's how I ended up in this body. But now, I know the correct calculation. What is it? I'll be glad to tell you... in exchange for that briefcase you're holding under the table. [Luther] Yeah, yeah, so you go back to 2019, as planned, but this time with the right math, so you remain a full-grown man. In exchange, we get that briefcase that you no longer need. Timeline restored, paradox resolved. Everyone goes on existing happily ever after. That's quite a bit to take in. What do you think? [adult Five] I think... I need to piss. [Luther] Oh. Well, besides the flop sweat, I think that went pretty well, am I right? No, no, there's something... - Something doesn't feel right about this. - What... What do you mean? I don't trust him. But he's you. Exactly. - [typewriters clacking nearby] - [office phone ringing] [gentle chime over speakers] [woman over PA] A tidy workspace is a happy workspace. [Diego] Bingo, the Infinite Switchboard. All right. [pops knuckles] How hard can this be? [switchboard whirring] - [console beeping] - [shouts, groaning] Oh! Please don't hurt me. [panting] Who the hell are you? I'm Herb. I'm an analyst. I'm Diego. I have a knife. [breath trembling] Yes, I can see. [gulps loudly] It's very shiny. Oh. [inhales sharply] Breathe. [panting softly] It's an honor to meet you, Mr. Hargreeves. You know me? Everybody knows you. I mean, you're Number Two. You're a legend. - Really? - Mr. Hargreeves, you can't be here. Herb, is that any way to talk to a legend? You know how to work this puppy? - I'm certified to operate the ISB, yes. - Good. I need you to look up a date: November 22, 1963, the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Unauthorized use of the Infinite Switchboard is a clear violation of company protocol 67D... Don't be such a tight-ass. You don't understand. - There's been a coup d'état. - What's that? - Cadillac? - No. [huffs softly] The Handler has taken over the Commission. The whole place has gone to heck in a handbasket, and people are disappearing. They would kill us both if they caught us in here. Well, you better get started before they come get us. One quick look, and then you gotta go. My man. [Herb] Okay... - Oh, no. Why would you... No, no. Bad. - [switchboard powers down] Don't hurt the timeline. That's a rule... - that I intend to follow. - [switchboard powering up] [machines whirring] This one connects to that one... [Herb muttering indistinctly] Okay. Here we go. Dallas. November 22, 1963. [Diego] This is it. - This is right before the assassination. - [Herb] Assassination? [Diego] Pay attention. The president is about to turn into Dealey Plaza. One more turn into Elm and they're gonna start shooting. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. What the hell is that? - [Herb] That's the FBI building. [Diego] Yeah, but why the hell did it just blow up? - [Herb] That's not supposed to happen? - [Diego] No, that's not sup... He's driving away. They didn't kill him? - Holy shit. - Oh... Oy, that's no bueno. It wasn't a gunshot, it was an explosion - we heard on the Frankel footage. - [reporter] ...the attack on Dealey Plaza, as the Soviets deny all responsibility. [reporter 2] Moscow promises a fierce response in retaliation to American attacks. [reporter 3] Anchorage, Alaska, has just been decimated by the Red Menace! [reporter 4] The world braces as we find ourselves - on the brink of nuclear war. - [alarm wails] - All citizens take cov... - [flat tone over broadcast] - That's what Hazel was trying to tell us. - Hazel? I mean, this is what causes doomsday. Do you have another angle on the FBI building? [Herb] Watch this. And... - [people screaming] - [wreckage crashing] [sirens wailing below] [high-pitched tone resonating, warbling] Vanya. Vanya is the bomb. Vanya is the bomb. She will always be the bomb. I need to get back to Dallas. Now. We need La Résistance. [overlapping low chatter] [group grows quiet] You gotta be kidding me. I know we don't look like much, but we're resourceful. Don't mess with case management. Stand down, Dot. {\an8}- [faucet running] - [Irish music plays, muted] [turns water off] [sighs softly] [toilet flushes] Oh. Sorry. Ugh. [chuckles] Yeah, that's a waste of time. Trust me. Then why were you holding it when I found you dead in the apocalypse? [Luther splutters] No idea. But the guy it belonged to didn't end the world. Vanya did. - Timid little Vanya. - [Luther] Yep. Is more powerful than all of us put together. Turns out, she was pissed about the way we treated her when we were kids, so she destroyed the moon and ended the world. Huh. Fair enough. [Luther zips pants, sighs] - Yeah... - This is perfect. We now know exactly what's gonna happen. Yeah, except it, uh, already did. Don't think, just listen. Forget about the little jerk-off's plan. It's way too complicated. A much better plan is for us to travel to 2019. All we have to do is make nice with Vanya, stop her from destroying the world. Easy-peasy. Hmm. Well, that's actually... - That's not bad, right? - Yeah, yeah. But what about Five? I mean, you? I mean, - the, uh, young you. - That's not me. That's a prepubescent photocopy that got botched in the time jump. - Besides, it's too late for him anyway. - Too late? Paradox psychosis? Best thing we can do is put him out of his misery. What? - You're... You're saying to kill him? - You're thinking about this all wrong. - We're not killing anybody. - No... Look at me. I'm Five, and I will still be alive. All we are doing is getting rid of a mutant doppelganger. Amputating a vestigial nipple. Wait... are you sure you don't have paradox psychosis? I've never felt better in my life. [door opens] - [lively Irish jig playing] - [patrons chattering] We good? - We're good. - You got a deal. We gotta hurry. Kennedy's en route. Less than an hour until showtime. Why are you so anxious to get going all of a sudden? Relax. - You're getting paranoid. - [scoffing chuckle] Oh, am I? [both Fives farting] Okay, let's roll. [dramatic instrumental music playing] [female interrogator] She'll start talking soon enough. Vanya, talking to us is your only option. Who is your handler? Answer me. - [Gibbs echoes] - [gasps softly] - Excuse me? - We're all waiting. - [Vanya] For what? - The answer. I... I don't... I don't understand. So you're not prepared, is that what you're saying? - Well, prepared for what? - [Ben] It's not her fault. She hit her head. She can't remember anything. She got overheated, wiped her mind clean. She's lazy. Didn't study. - No, no, that's not it. I... - Maybe she's been faking it all along. - She's just not ready for this. - [Reginald] You're all wrong. Number Seven deliberately chooses not to remember. [Vanya] Mom? Are you okay? Of course I am. Why wouldn't I be? Something wrong? - Just not hungry. - [Reginald] Try it. - It might help you remember. - [Gibbs echoes] ...remember. [Gibbs] Vanya, what are you doing in Dallas? Keep ignoring me and see what happens. [female interrogator] We will get you to talk. - [cutlery clinks softly on plates] - [suspenseful instrumental music playing] [squishy chewing] [suspenseful instrumental music swells] - [groans] - [Harlan moaning] [Vanya grunting and choking] - Number Seven! Either you remember... - [siblings laughing] or you will go to your room without dessert! [cutlery rattling] [Gibbs] What the hell's going on with the lights? [female interrogator] She's not responding. Let's help motivate her. [electricity surges] [gasps, moans loudly] [Harlan groaning] [shuddering grunts] [Gibbs] Are you here to kill the president? [crying out, groaning] [Allison panting] God, why are people so much heavier when they're dead? You got a lot of practice at this? [Klaus chuckles] Yeah. Hey, so, what was it like when I possessed you? It was like sex with one of the lesser Baldwins. I mean, you can feel him clattering around in there, but do you really care? Why? What was it like driving all this hot business? It... It was like having no skin... but still wanting to touch... everything. [whispers] Oh, yeah. Okay. One... two... [straining, grunts] - [zapping whoosh] - [Ray shrieks] - Shit! - [all gasping, panting] - [Allison] Oh! - [Diego] Oh, good. All right, you're both here. All right, we gotta go. Diego, Jesus! [chuckling] Wow. Number Two, Three, and Four. We almost have an Umbrella straight flush here. Ray, this is my other brother, Diego. [Diego] Hey, man. Sorry to crash in here like this. Hey, who is this guy? Herb. He worked with Five at the Commission. The Commission? We monitor and maintain the time-space continuum. - Okay. - [Diego] No, for real. I was just there. It's awesome. Okay, I got to look at the timeline. I know what causes doomsday. It's Vanya. Wait, what? How? Gonna blow up the federal building at Dealey Plaza just as the president's passing through in less than one hour. We gotta find her and stop her, now. - Wait, Vanya kills the president? - [Diego] No, no, no. See, the explosion causes the motorcade to drive off. Kennedy lives. Everybody thinks Russia's behind it, including the president. He strikes back, they strike back. Before you know it, it's raining nukes. - Okay, um... - Holy shit. - [Allison] Ray? Ray, baby. - [panting] - Are... Are you okay? Okay. - No, I'm not okay. First of all, this son of bitch beams into our living room with yet another one of your brothers, and he's talking about stopping one of your sisters from blowing up some buildings, and I got a dead man wrapped up in my best rug, babe. Okay. Okay, okay. Can we... Can we... Raymond. Ray. Ray. Or we can have that shampooed. We also provide body removal services. [chuckles] [Raymond's breath trembling] I love you, Raymond Chestnut... and I really wish I had time for the nervous breakdown you so deserve. [Allison inhales shakily] But you have to go. I have to go. [tender instrumental music plays] [Allison takes deep breath] - [low chatter] - [office phone rings nearby] Hey, where's that new recruit? The shaggy hair, caveman face? [instructor] No clue, sorry. [gentle chime over speakers] [woman over PA] Loyalty isn't a choice, it's a lifestyle. - [people cheering along street] - [marching band plays nearby] [indistinct chatter] [Gibbs] Vanya, I don't wanna keep doing this to you, but I have a responsibility to the public, - and I need to know who you are. - [foreboding instrumental music plays] [Reginald] Eat up, it's getting cold. - [Vanya] I don't want it. - I know you don't want it, but you can't pretend it doesn't exist. I'm not pretending. [Reginald] Of course you are. You choose to live in a fantasy, a land of make-believe where you don't have to face up to who you really are. Rather than face the complexities of your own existence, you choose to hide inside someone else's. A silly life on a silly farm. That's not meant for you. - [elevator dings] - [foreboding instrumental music continues] - [Allison sighs] - [doors close] - [elevator whirring] - [Allison] I hope we find Vanya in time. You can't deny your true self any longer, even if you are afraid. - [panting] I'm not afraid. - [Reginald] Then eat! One more bite, and you can go. [foreboding instrumental music building] [thunder booms] [choking] [thunder crashing] [female interrogator] What the hell is happening? [Gibbs] We've gotta stop her. [gasping] [groaning softly] [female interrogator] You're going to have to terminate. [Gibbs] I'm trying! I'm trying! - [shuddering cries] - [electricity crackling] [energy crackling] - [Gibbs] How is she still alive? - [tortured moans] I remember. I remember. [energy crackling, thrumming] [rumbling, rattling] [elevator creaking] - [wind whistling] - [elevator dings] [all grunting, gasping] [Allison cries out] [gasping] [grunts] - [shouts] - [energy crackling] [Allison gasping] [Klaus] Question, guys. Who are we trying to save Vanya from? [both] FBI! But if they're all sucking ceiling right now, why hasn't she stopped? [intense crackling, thrumming] [rock violin music playing]
