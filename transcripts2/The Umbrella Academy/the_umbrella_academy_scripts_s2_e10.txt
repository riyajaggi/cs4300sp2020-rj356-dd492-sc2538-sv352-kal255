 [soft guitar notes play] [melancholy piano melody playing] [somber instrumental music swells] Your father is ready to give the eulogy, children. The world is full of injustice. Good people die along with the bad. This cosmic equation will never change unless evil itself is wiped from existence. Thankfully, there are powerful forces pushing back against the wicked and iniquitous, individuals who have the strength to pull together

 against insurmountable odds to face adversity with unblinking courage, and not to hesitate to sacrifice themselves for another. - [breath trembles] - Unfortunately, none of you are such people. - [sighs] - Despite years of training and weeks of preparation, you allowed Number Six to die - on this mission. - [gasps] - It wasn't our fault. - [Reginald] Excuses? I will not hear them. The Umbrella Academy has failed one of their own, the consequences of which are dire. Hold on to this feeling, children. - [sniffling] - Let it fester in your hearts...

 so there is never a next time. Training will be canceled today out of respect for your brother. We resume tomorrow at 6:00 a.m. [soft sniffling] [Allison sobbing softly] It wasn't anybody's fault. How would you know, Vanya? You weren't even on the mission. [gasps softly] [Vanya whimpers] - Nice going, asshole. - [Diego] What? - We were all thinking it. - [Allison] Oh, so you're thinking, Diego? That's a first. - Screw you! - Hey! Dad was right. We should've done more. This didn't have to happen. [footsteps retreating] - [Allison] Excuse me? - [Diego] I couldn't do it all by myself. [conversation continues indistinctly] [Diego] You're supposed to be Number One... [sniffles, exhales] [inhales sharply, grunting] [energy warbling softly, fading] - [Ben] Klaus? - [Klaus gasps] [exhales sharply] Where... Where am I? You're back in the land of the living. It's been a total shitshow since you died. The family's a mess. [opens flask] Listen, um... I need to go back. What? No. Why? - You just got here. - I know. But there's a light, and they told me to walk into it. That thing? Pfft. Don't worry about it. - You can go whenever you want. - Are you sure? Yeah, 1,000 percent. Trust me, Benerino. It's not goin' anywhere. I'm the expert on the dead, remember? Hey, wanna watch me piss in Dad's gas tank? Yeah, sure. [instrumental music swells] [reporter on TV] Authorities are asking for help identifying several persons of interest at Dealey Plaza at the time of the assassination. {\an8}The FBI believes they may have been acting in concert with the alleged shooter, Lee Harvey Oswald. Vanya Hargreeves, wanted in connection with the deaths of several FBI agents {\an8}inside the federal building at Dealey Plaza. A Cuban exile known only as Diego... - [Diego] Cuban? - Who recently escaped from the Holbrook Sanitarium. A bare-knuckle boxer {\an8}with suspected Mafia ties {\an8}who fights under the alias "King Kong." {\an8}Allison Chestnut, {\an8}a Negro radical responsible for instigating and organizing the recent riots at Stadtler's lunch counter. And finally, Klaus, the controversial cult leader and known tax evader. The FBI is asking the public to be on the lookout for this unidentified boy, who they believe is being held hostage by the suspected terrorist network... - Well, it's true. - [report continues indistinctly] I do feel like I'm being held hostage most days. - God, I hate that photo. - They're saying I instigated the riot? - [scoffs] That's unbelievable. - [Luther] Look, the good news is that we restored the timeline and we stopped doomsday. - So... - Yeah, a bunch of real goddamn heroes. We let Kennedy die. Yeah, and now we're officially the most wanted people in the world. The FBI is after us, the Dallas police, the Secret Service. It's only a matter of time before they hunt us down here. - Well, where are we supposed to go? - I have this yurt just outside Reykjavik. We could totally lay low there. Folks there are a little weird, but lovely. - Hey, numbnuts. - [Klaus] Welcoming... Hiding's not gonna make a difference here. The Commission will hunt us down wherever and whenever we go. He's right. They'll never stop. I'm sorry, since when are you an expert on the Commission? Since I got back from there. - What? - [Diego] Yeah, they headhunted me, offered me a job. Full time with benefits, which I had to turn down. [Five] They headhunted you... [chuckles] ...the village idiot. What, am I not allowed to be headhunted? Only the almighty Five needs to be in demand? [Five] Diego, you're not Commission material, all right? Got an obstinate nature to ya. Who do you think it was that figured out Vanya was the one that causes doomsday and stopped it? Me. - Hey! - [Diego] That's who. I figured it all out on the Infinite Switchboard. - You were on the Infinite Switchboard? - Hell, yeah. I made that machine my bitch. Y'all need to recognize I got shit going on y'all don't even know about. - Oh, sorry. You've got things going on? - This isn't helpful. Look, I met the Résistance in their secret lair. All right? I went through orientation and I passed and I stopped doomsday. [phone ringing] - [sighs] Sissy, why aren't you picking up? - [argument continues downstairs] - [Harlan shouts] - [gasps] Help me! [panting] [Vanya] Harlan! [glass shatters] [gasps softly, exhaling] [Diego] At least I wasn't busy playing with myself… [Allison] Can you dispense with the dick-measuring for five minutes? [Klaus] Unless you can literally, 'cause Ben and I... [Luther] We don't have time for this. The Feds could be here any minute. - [Allison] That's what I've been saying. - [Luther] I'm agreeing. [Five] Okay, calm down, Hairy... [Luther] Hey, it's King Kong. And I'm sick of your ass, okay? - Yeah, okay, you win. - Guys, we need to move, okay? That is more important here. That is our only option. [Diego] We need to box those windows - and stay here. - I'm leaving. What? To go where? Sissy's farm. Something's wrong with Harlan, - and I need to help him. - Vanya, we need to stick together, okay? Now more than ever. That's why I'm telling you this. Whatever's going on with Harlan, I think I might've caused it. How? [sighs] He drowned, and, uh, somehow I was able to bring him back to life. And now it's like we're connected. - Wh... What does that even mean? - I don't know. I can't explain, but... I know that he needs my help. [sighs softly] I need your help, too. I'm scared. And for the first time in my life, I don't wanna do it alone. I want my family by my side. Look, I'm sorry. We have other priorities right now. [Five] Diego's right. For once. We need to make our stand here and now. [Vanya] Okay. I guess I'll see you when I see you. [door opens, shuts] [keys jingling] - [starts engine] - [door opens] [Klaus] So, so, so... Ben, huh? Gone forever. Isn't he? He traded his life for mine... while he saved the world in the process. Pfft. Show-off. But did he... say anything about... me? He wanted me to tell you that he was too scared to go to the light. It wasn't you that made him stay. [chuckles] Oh, that little shit-heel. [scoffs softly] All these years, and I thought it was my fault that he didn't take his ticket to heaven. [laughs] Look, I'm sorry, but... - you should get out, 'cause I need to... - Oh, no, I'm coming with. I can't let you face the unknown alone, right? [footsteps approach] Got room for two more? - [doors slam] - What about the Commission? Well, might as well do some good before we die horribly. Whoo-hoo! Oh! Five, you... you don't have to... I know. You owe me one, sis. - Children ride in the back. - [Klaus] Okay. [Allison] Whoa! - Oh, Christ. - [Klaus grunts] Guys, I don't know what to say. [shocks squeaking, creaking loudly] [crunching] [creaking continues] [door slams shut] Anyone makes a fat joke, and I'm outta here. [engine rumbling] [metal scraping] [metal crunching] [engine starts] [bicycle bell jingles] {\an8}[suspenseful instrumental music plays] - [wind whistling] - [foreboding instrumental music playing] [energy crackling, sizzling] [lightning crashes] You think whatever's going on inside is causing the cold front? Well, the correlation is high. - [Vanya] Sissy! Sissy! - [racks round] Get back! - All of you, just get the hell back! - [Vanya] Sissy! Hey! Hey! What's wrong? [panting] - Carl. - What did he do to you? [breathing shakily] He's... He's dead. Harlan tossed him aside like a rag doll, same way you sent those policemen flyin'. - What did you do to him? - No... What the hell did you do to my son? - Don't have time for this. - Where you think you're going? - To help your son. - Look, Sissy, I found my family. These are my brothers and my sister. - [energy crackling] - Ma'am. Were you lyin' to me the whole time? Of course not. Look, I didn't know who I was. But I do now. And we are not the monsters that they say we are. We did not kill the president. We are not terrorists. We're not here to hurt anyone. Then... [panting softly] Who are you? The only one who can help Harlan. [energy resonating, rushing] [Vanya] Harlan? Harlan, it's Vanya! [Harlan gasping] Look, Harlan, I know you're really scared, but I can help you. I need you to listen to me, okay? Can you do that? [Harlan continues gasping] [high-pitched tone resonates] [Harlan grunting] [Five] Careful. [energy whooshes nearby] Harlan? I don't know if you can hear me... - [Vanya continues indistinctly] - [Klaus] Uh... - guys? - [Diego] What? [Vanya] You don't have to do this! - Ah, shit. - What, who are they? One's the Handler, the other's Diego's girlfriend. - Lila. That's my ex-girlfriend. - What? You know what? Doesn't matter. They both look angry. - Yeah. - Our brother has that effect on people. I'm gonna go find out what they want. You guys stay with Vanya and the kid. I'm coming with you, too. Come on. [Vanya] Harlan! - Harlan, I can help! - [Harlan gasps] [Handler chuckles] I love the smell of that fresh country air, - don't you, darling? - Makes me want to vomit. What do you want? - To watch you suffer. - What about me? You're not even worth my wrath. [Handler] Easy. We're here on official business. And what business is that? As the head of the Commission, I've decided to eliminate the criminals responsible for the assassination of the former board of directors. Yeah, right. We didn't kill the board. Uh, actually, Diego, that's not entirely accurate. You didn't tell them. Oh, Five. - What do you think they're talking about? - I don't know. Which one's the girlfriend? Five, what the hell did you do? What I had to to get my family home. Until somebody reneged on our deal. Somebody wouldn't have reneged if somebody could've met a simple deadline. - Alas. - You set me up to fail. You set yourself up to fail, friend. You and your brothers and sisters. Kinda the running theme of your little life, isn't it? [laughs] Dude, I can't believe you killed the board of directors. You have no idea how messed up the Commission is right now. - Messed up? Who's saying that? - Everybody. Christ, even the janitors think it's going to shit. That's not all he killed. What are you talking about? Don't play dumb, you prepubescent piece of shit. Enough. The point is, all of you are going to die today. Hmm? Oh. Well, I don't like your chances. Seven of us, two of you. You know, you're right. Let's change that. - [snaps fingers] - [rapid whooshing] [lightning crashes] Oh, my God. [foreboding instrumental music swells] - [firearms cocking] - [Five exhales shakily] So what do we do now? Well, we got two choices: fight and die now or run and die later. - Either way, we're food for worms. - Preference? Wouldn't mind a few more minutes breathing air through the old windbags. All right. Let's get this over with, shall we? Run! - [energy crackling] - [Allison] Go! Go! [overlapping battle cries] Harlan! Listen to my voice. I know you don't want to hurt anyone. - Yes, Harlan. Harlan, listen to me. - [gasping] [Vanya] Listen to my voice. Harlan, you're okay. - [gasping] - [Vanya] You're gonna be okay. [automatic gunfire] - [bullets ricocheting] - [Five and Diego panting] You're okay. [bullets impacting, ricocheting] - [Sissy grunts] - [shock resonates] [screams] Harlan! [gasping] - [automatic gunfire continues] - [Allison] Get down! [Luther] Whoa! [grunts heavily] Sissy! Sissy, are you okay? Yeah! But Harlan! - Go check on him! - What are you gonna do? [bullets striking, ricocheting] I'm gonna end this thing. [Sissy panting] [grunts] - [rapid gunfire] - [Diego grunts] We're not gonna make it! - What are you doing? - [both grunting] - [Diego] Five, I think I'm gonna puke. - No time! [bullets striking, ricocheting] - [Five] What now? - We blink into the house, man! - [softly] Okay. - [energy ripples] - [battle cries continue] - [energy flutters] - What? - Shit, I'm out of fuel. I'm too tired. Go! I'll... I'll cover for you. - Diego, what are you... - [Diego] Go! [dramatic instrumental music swells] [overlapping shouts] Shit. [glass shattering] - [glass continues shattering] - [bullets impacting, ricocheting] - [sounds fading] - [grim instrumental music plays] [high-pitched tone resonating] - [energy thrumming softly] - [sounds remain muted] - [high-pitched tone intensifying] - [Diego] Whoa! [all gasp] [gasps softly] [Vanya grunts] - [wind howling] - [glass shatters] [high-pitched tone hums softly] - [tone gently ebbs] - [Vanya exhales sharply] [gasping] [panting, grunts softly] [wind whistling gently] [group panting] [Allison] It's over. [energy whooshing steadily] How are they doing that? [Handler] Your turn, dear. [energy thrumming] - [high-pitched tone resonating] - [wind whistling] What the hell? That's not normal. - [power continues building] - [whispers] Shit. Shit. [Luther] Whoa! Whoa! [grunts, gasps softly] - [gasping] - [Klaus] Catch me! Catch me! Catch me! - Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! - [energy humming softly] [whispers] Oh, thank God. - [yells] - [tractor creaking] [Handler cackling] Aah! Well done, darling. Let me know when you've killed them all, will you? Okay, Mum. - [growling] - Luther, you all right? [rasps] Oh, I think I swallowed my tongue. Luther, if you swallowed your tongue, you wouldn't be talking, you big moron. Come on, on your feet. [Luther groans] Hey, what the hell happened? - What was that? - She must've redirected - Vanya's energy wave. - Yeah, I know, but how? Luther, watch out! Five! [panting] - [grunting] - [tractor creaking] [Luther] Five! [Lila sighs, chuckles] What are you? Someone who wants to kill your brother. Well, that's understandable. Diego can be a lot to handle. Yeah, I was talking about Five. Him, too. But, unfortunately, they're family, so you're shit out of luck. - [Luther grunts, groans] - [leather glove creaking] How is this possible? [straining grunt] Gotta believe in yourself, big boy. [groaning] Luther! Luther! Luther, Luther, Luther... are you okay? Hey! - Oy. - [Luther groans] Hi. - We haven't officially met. I'm Lila. - [Allison] Yeah. It is so nice to meet you. [Lila grunts] Yeah, I like you. [Allison cries out] Is that the best you got? [both grunting] [Lila shouts] [Allison groans, panting] [strained grunts] - [Lila groans] - [Allison panting] - I heard a rumor... [echoing] - you stopped breathing. - [Lila's words echo] - [gasping] No! Allison! [Allison wheezing] - No! No! - [Allison exhales sharply] - You gotta fight it. Allison, fight it. - [wheezing] Fight it. Breathe, Allison. Breathe. [Five groans] Breathe. Shit. No, Allison! - Breathe. Fight it. - [Five] You looking for me? - [Luther] Breathe. - [Allison gasps] You little turd. Let's dance. - You can fight this. Breathe. - [shuddering gasp] Breathe, Allison. - No. - [faint gurgling] Look at me! Breathe! Breathe, Allison. [exhaling] Breathe, come on. Fight it, Allison. Breathe! Come on, breathe. [exhaling] Breathe, Allison. Come on. Breathe! [inhales sharply, coughing] - [gasping, coughs] - [Luther] Shh. You okay? You okay? [gasping breaths] I'm sorry. I had to do the thing - because I... Yeah. - Shh. [panting] [laughs shakily] [panting] - Okay. - [Diego] Allison, help! Luther! Oh, shit. Come on. [both grunting] [Five grunts, inhales sharply] [Lila gasps] Careful, now, or you are going to tire yourself out. How are you doing this? Oh, anything that you can do, I can do better. [scoffs] [energy pulsing, warbling] [Sissy] Is that you, Vanya? - Who the hell are you? - [mock Texas drawl] I'm his new mama. [Sissy groans] [popping knuckles] [panting softly] Magnificent. And you don't talk back. I like that. [Diego] Help! [groaning softly] [Diego] Vanya! Help! Come on, man! Hey! What took you so long? Well, we're here now. Do you wanna stop complaining? - Or we could just leave you here. - [Allison] What he said. Does everything in this family have to be a discussion? [Luther straining] [Allison] Go, go, go, go! - [Luther] Are you out? - [Diego] Yeah! [Luther grunts] - Team Zero! Unstoppable. - All right. [exhales sharply] - [Luther] Uh... - Okay, has anyone seen Five? [Luther] I don't know, he's around somewhere. By the way, your ex-girlfriend can blink like Five. Yeah, that bitch just rumored me so I couldn't breathe. And destroyed, like, half the farm with a shock wave. So unoriginal. If she can do everything we can, she might as well just be one of us. [chuckles] Yeah. [Luther] No. No, there's no way. It can't be. It's a reasonable conclusion. Eh, but there were only seven of us. Maybe we need to consider that there's more. [Allison] Are we surprised? Dad never told us the whole truth about anything. But she's not our biological sister... right? Okay, so, if she can mirror our powers, that means anything we throw at her, she can match, right? Yeah, but she can only mirror one of our powers at a time. You sure about that? [Lila grunts] - [shouts] - [clangs loudly] [groans] Harlan, my love... I can take you to a place where you will be properly understood, listened to, even without a voice. [Five groans softly] [Lila grunts heavily] I understand your kind. Doesn't feel so good, does it? [Five gasps] I can tap into your potential, and together, just the two of us, we can do incredible things. Hmm? [rasping] Eat shit and die. - [cries out, shouts] - [Five groans] [panting] Come on. What are you waiting for? Let's finish this thing. [whispers] No. [sniffles] This isn't gonna be quick. [Lila panting] You are going to suffer for what you did. [scoffs] Lady, I got no idea what you're talkin' about. Ronnie and Anita Gill. - Mean nothing to me. - 1993, East London. You hog-tied them and you shot them in the head. The flower merchants. [Anita sobbing] No, no! No! They were your parents? - [Ronnie] No, don't! No, please... - [casing clatters] [silenced gunshot] [Lila] And they never did anything to anyone. - They didn't deserve to die like that. - [Five] You're right, all right? I killed them. But I killed a lot of people over the years. It was all just a job. All right? That was never personal. [laughs] "Never personal," my ass. Yeah, I've killed. It's always, always personal. That's why you're not cut out to be an assassin. - Bet your life on that? - You wanna blame someone? Blame the Handler, all right? She faked the kill order. Bullshit. I saw the kill order. AJ Carmichael ordered it, and you carried it out. Lila, listen to what I'm telling you, all right? The Handler gave me the kill order. She came on the job, which she'd never done before. You're Commission. You know execs never go on jobs, but that day in London, she was there. - Ask yourself why. - Stop trying to muddy the waters. I never realized what she was up to at the time, but... now it all makes sense. What? She never cared about your parents. She was looking for you. [whispers] Why? [Diego] 'Cause you're one of us. The Handler stole you, Lila. Just like our asshole father took all of us. - No. It's not the same thing. - [Diego] You're right. Because he didn't have our parents murdered. Listen to me, Lila. You were born October 1, 1989, the same day as all of us. - Stay back! - Hey! Hey, stop! Wait. Wait. Hey! - Lila? Lila, stop. - I trusted you. I got you a job, I even introduced you to my mother, - and then you took off on me. - Because I needed to save the world! She's using you, Lila. The Handler. [Lila] You're wrong. She raised me. - She loves me. - Yeah, you know what? Love shouldn't have to hurt this much. [gags] - All right, I tried. - He's right. We have to kill her. Hey! Five! Five, stop. I got it. Hey, Lila. Truth? She's dangerous. And you're scared of what she'll do with all that new power. That's why you dragged me to the Commission. Because I know what it's like to love dangerous people. Difference is... they love me back. - Shut up. - The only thing she loves is power. Now, the minute she can't use you, she will turn on you, and deep down, I know you know that. You don't know me, Diego. Don't I? I know that we can be your family... if you just let us. [inspirational instrumental melody plays] [Lila sniffling] [automatic gunfire] [voice trembles] Diego, no... [Lila sniffling] Aww. [sniffles] - It's true, what Five said, isn't it? - [Handler] Darling, I need to know that we can get past this, be a happy family again. Hmm? They're my real family. Do you even love me? [Lila grunts] Que será, será. [gasps softly] [Handler] Oh, good. You're still alive. Lucky you. You got to see how this all played out. [suspenseful instrumentals swelling] [gunshots] [Handler gasps sharply] [weapon cocking] [panting softly] [Five] This doesn't have to be the end. We use my ability to time travel. [Luther] You're the genius who said we should jump. Right? You're the one who got us stuck here. Maybe your appetite is disproportionate to the size of your abilities. Start small. Seconds, not decades. - [energy thrumming, crackling] - [instrumental music swells] [sounds resonating in reverse] [slo-mo gunshots] [Diego] I know that we can be your family, if you just let us. [Handler gasps] [wrestling movements] [Lila] It's true, isn't it? What Five said. Answer me! Is it true? Well... [Handler grunts softly] [gasps] - The case! - [Diego] No! [grunts] - [heavy groan] - [energy whooshes] [weapon cocking] [weapon thuds] Enough. [panting] [in Swedish] Enough. I almost had her. Why the hell did you stop me? Because... I love her. Who the hell was that guy? - [Sissy] Vanya! Help! - [Vanya] Harlan. [door creaks open] - [Vanya] Sissy? - [energy thrumming] Harlan? Harlan! Whatever it is I gave you, I can take it back, okay? We just, we need to stop this. [Harlan whimpers softly] [high-pitched tone] [dramatic instrumental music swells] [energy whooshing] [Vanya gasps] [panting] [gasps softly] [sobbing] Oh, baby. Oh, baby. Oh! [breath trembling] [laughs, kissing] [Herb breathes shakily] Yowza. [Dot] I should've brought my parka. [Herb] Yeah. Oh, wow. Excuse me, pardon me. - [Dot] Ooh... - Watch your step. - [cow moos in distance] - [Herb mutters] - [Five] Herb. Dot. - [Herb whispers] Sorry. - [chuckles] Hey. - [Dot] Hi. Sup, Herbie? [Herb] Hey! My man. [chuckling] - All good? - Good to see you guys. [blows air] [sighs] I can't believe it. Is she...? - Really dead this time? - Oh, yeah. - [Herb whispers] Oh. - [Five] Now that the Handler's gone, what happens at Commission? - Just tell them. - Eh... Well... we need to elect a new board of directors. But, until then, I, um... I've been voted in as acting chairperson. - [Dot squeaks softly] - [Diego] No shit. Congrats, Herbie. That's huge. I'm so goddamn nervous. - You'll do fine. - Oh, thank you. Herb, we need a favor. - Oh, sure, anything. - [Five] A briefcase. Get back home, where we belong. Take your pick. [front door opens] [Vanya] Sissy? - [front door closes] - We gotta get Harlan packed. Hey. The sooner we leave, the safer it is for everyone, and we can figure out the next steps from there. [mourning dove calls outside] [sighs] We can't go with you. [melancholy piano melody plays] Why not? [voice trembles] To the future? Vanya, that's crazy talk. I mean, what would that even look like? Well, we could be a family. I mean, just the three of us. - We could have a whole life together. - [Sissy] What about Harlan? What if something happens to him? And what if we're separated? I can't risk losing him. What if they, like, blame you for Carl or... Vanya... I saw you. [sniffles] Outside the barn. [splutters softly] I... I saw you fl... float. So, what, you're... you're scared of me now? Is... Is that what this is? No, no. Scared for you. Tell me we could have a normal life there... and no one would ever come after us for being with you like they did today. [sniffles, voice breaking] I can't. Vanya, I would do anything for you. To protect you. But Harlan has been through enough. I can't... I can't put that child in any more danger. I can't. [sniffling] You have given me the greatest gift of a lifetime. You let me feel alive for the first time. [gasping breath] [sobs softly, sniffles] [chuckles] You helped me find hope again. That's a wonderful thing. Where will you go? I'm not sure. Um... [sniffles] I have, um... uh, a friend in California. You go there, and you live a beautiful and wonderful life. You ever find a safe way back to me, you take it. [sniffling] You hear me? [gasps] [instrumental music swells] [sighs, sniffling] [both sniffling] [reporter on TV] the crack of an assassin's bullet. A nation mourns, the world grieves. The man who became the 35th president less than three years ago is dead. He led his country boldly through the treacherous shoals of Cold War crises. His firm commitments to support the cause of democracy throughout the world won him acclaim almost unprecedented in the history of the presidency... [broadcast continues indistinctly] [Allison] Ray: We should've known I'd find a way to get the last word in. [chuckles softly] The good news is... we did it. The world is safe again. But the president is dead. And I am long gone. [Ray exhales slowly] I wish I could be with you right now, in your arms. I don't belong in 1963, but my time here has changed me.
