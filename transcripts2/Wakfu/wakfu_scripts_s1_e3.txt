 {\fad(0,500)}and let your light guide your destiny! {\fad(1000,1000)}Episode 03: The Black Raven Isn't going through a Zaap gate for the first time exciting? It's nothing new for me, of course. There's no point in bragging. I saw you fall flat on your face when you arrived. You got back up as fast as you could. I slipped! And you should show more respect for your elders, kiddo! Hah! It's no biggie, Ruel, I slipped too. Stop acting like children. If we want to reach Oma, we have to get along and work together! You're right, Eva. We didn't go on an adventure to quarrel like spoiled princesses. Alright! Are we gonna visit Kelba's market or not? Last one there's a crummy gobball! Wow, there's a lot of awesome stuff here! Way cool! And for a few kamas you can have whatever you want! Perfect! Alright. The first thing we should do is pool our money to buy a world map. Count me out! My purse's emptier than a cawwot field on Wabbits Island! You spent it all on those rags you're wearing, right? What's with the bworkish laugh? It's not really worthy of a young lady. But that's not me! That's him! It's the Black Raven! The Black Raven? It's the Black Raven! I'm starting to like this place! Take cover! I'll handle that madman! Take cover? Don't be silly! Hey, Black Raven! Come down and fight! Pitiful merchants! Fear the fire of darkness! Fear your worst nightmare! Tremble before the might of the Black Raven! He's destroying everything! What are we gonna do? Let me think... Oh, right! I know! We do nothing! We wait until it's over! Or maybe... Here, please keep an eye on my tofu. I'll be back soon! Come down here and fight, you coward! Ouch, looks like he heard you. He's fast, but if we attack together we'll stand a chance against him. Ready? Ready! Ready! Three! Two! That coward! Look, he's fleeing! He just finished what he came here to do. We're lucky, that was a close call! That cursed bird! I knew he'd be back! But if you think I'll leave over such a trifle, you're making a big mistake! Sorry, mister. We couldn't do anything to stop him from destroying your shop. At least you tried. It's the thought that counts. Are there other merchants around here? We're looking for a world map. Bah, it pains me to advertise a competitor, but, well... A bit further south you'll find Kabrok's shop, specialized in random stuff. And he doesn't get attacked? Oh, no. Kabrok's as wealthy as he is clever. He built his shop underground, beyond the Black Raven's grasp. Thank you for such precious information, my good man. Rest assured that if we meet that Black Raven again, he won't escape unscathed! Really? No offense meant, but you weren't exactly stellar this time, right? You see that? That Kabrok guy seems to be famous around here. Right, it's impossible to miss. Alright, there we are. Anyone in there?! If you've come to spend a few kamas, you are welcome, my lords. It's true that if Featherface wanted to destroy this shop he'd have to become the Black Mole. Do you think they've got Sadida bags? Awesome, Captain Amakna's shield! Everything's far too expensive! They've even got the Trool Encyclopedia! This place rules! It's awesome! You haven't seen anything yet, little buddy. If you're already fantasizing about this dump, just wait until you see Bonta's shops. Why thank you, I'm always delighted to hear such things. Your words are hurting me, mister adventurer. And they're inaccurate words to boot. In my shop you'll find riches that can't be seen anywhere else. There are treasures here I couldn't have foreseen. Please forgive my rudeness, milady. Kabrok! Welcome to Kabrok, wonders from the whole world, and happiness for adventurers. Everything here is for sale as long as you can pay the price. And to spare ourselves the trouble of time-wasting penniless people... we submit all our customers to a little test. What's that thing? This charming creature is called a snoofle. It's peerless at sniffing out kamas. We use it to find loose change that's rolled under the furniture. Oh, and also this: the richer you are, the more it likes you. Ew! It's not seriously going to sniff Ruel? That's disgusting! Hey, that thingy of yours is broken! Of course, of course... My lords, we are at your service. Bags! Do you have Sadida bags? Mine's totally out of fashion! Seeds! Tofu seeds! Seeds? Yes, over there. You're in luck, I've just received a bag shipment from Pandala. Kabrok! They're all the rage with Bonta's ladies, you know. Wow! Sadly, we're not here for bags. We're looking for a world map. A map? Maps are pretty rare items... Kabrok? We do have a map, right? Very, very rare... These merchants are overdoing it. Wow! A trophy room! All of these monsters are incredible! I found the seeds you were looking for. These ones, right? Are you the one who hunted all these creatures? Some of them are really impressive. And... weird... Yes! It's true. They're impressive. I was a great collector in my youth. Indeed! But you're done collecting now. Oh, yes! I know what you mean, milady. As the Enutrof saying goes: "Collecting is good, but reselling..." "... is better!" Here's the world map you asked me for. It should please a connoisseur such as you. It's exceptional! Oh, Miranda, not the Grav'Mar'Av's map! It's priceless! Dear husband, everything has a price. It simply won't be said that some travelers couldn't find what they needed in our shop! But... its power... Power? Here! Behold! But... There's nothing on it. O', my sweet, sensual map of wonders... All-seeing and all-knowing... Show me our beautiful land of Kelba, please! How could I refuse such a polite offer? Interesting... It talks! We've gotta get it! Impossible! Oh please, Kabrok. Such a fuss for a mere map! You're above that! Milord Ruel, I have an offer for you and your friends. You're getting the map for free... If you rid us of the Black Raven. The Black Raven again? What's your problem with him anyway? He never attacked us! It's quite the opposite... He rids us of competitors. We seldom see adventurers because of him. It's not good for business. Not to mention his horrible laugh, echoing for hours after each of his evil deeds! My poor lady. It must have been a bloodcurdling ordeal. The Raven for the map? Easy! That's perfect! We've got a score to settle with him! We need a plan. Ruel? Hm? Hey, why are you guys looking at me like that? He looks just like a real one. An authentic merchant from the land of Kelba. One last detail and it'll be perfect! Ruel, remember your lines? Everything you want is at Ruel's... Weapons for fighters, tools for tinkerers... That's great! You three, get to your posts. And why am I the bait? "My purse's emptier than a cawwot field on Wabbits Island!" Judging by the snoofle's expression back then, you're richer than Krasus, mister Enutrof. So either you pay in kind, or you pay for the map. Uh... All of a sudden I feel very heroic! I'm sure you do... Wow, look! I didn't know Evangelyne knew how to make fireworks too! That won't help her shoot down the Black Raven. Everything you want is at Ruel's! Weapons for fighters, tools for tinkerers! Hey guys, he's right there! Maybe you could come out now? Pitiful mortals! Fear the fire of darkness! Fear your worst{\fscx150}-{\fscx200} Just one moment! I've got a question for you first. Be careful, Yugo! We don't know what he's capable of! You should listen to your friend, kiddo. Fear the fire of darkness! Fear your worst nightmare! Tremble{\fscx150}-{\fscx200} What kind of name is the, "Black Raven?" It's completely ridiculous! What? Huh... Uh... What do you mean, ridiculous? All ravens are black! Hey, that's true! My little buddy is right! Uh... Right, but it's to emphasize my malevolent side. Kinda like the, "Black Knight", see? Yeah. Anyway, where was I- Oh, right{\fscx150}-{\fscx200} Fear the fire of darkness! Fear your{\fscx150}-{\fscx200} But then you should've chosen something else! Something like the, "Evil Raven" or the, "Demonic Raven!" The, "Grim Raven!" Hey, that one's not bad! The Grim Raven! I'd prefer something like, uh... The, "Wacky Vulture" Hey, come on. Seriously... "Skyfire!" The fire of darkness... the worst nightmare... It could even have been something like the, "Dark Raven." Or the, "Feathered Darkness!" Wait, let's be methodical. We've got to note all these ideas or we're going to forget them. Alright, I get it! You're coming with me! Uh... Darn. I didn't see that coming. How are we going to find Ruel? Do we really want to find him? Mister Kabrok! Miss Miranda! Do you think they'll lend us their snoofle? How should I know? If only you'd let me buy a few bags... We need that snoofle! It's our only way to find Ruel. Be still! Don't scare him. I'm sure you remember the old guy who smelled like kamas, right? What's all that ruckus? Can one not count their kamas in peace?! Kabrok! Kabrok! Where's he gone to now? Kabrok! So... You're done with your nap, gramps? What am I doing here? You're the bait. Again? That's been happening a lot lately! We're going to quietly wait for your friends, and then we'll have a memorable fight. The kind of fight that turns into a legend. It's a nice day to cross blades and fight to the death! Don't you think? Right. Isn't this place a little too far up to fight? We could very well have done that down there. Don't be silly! For a fight the location is as important as the opponent. Here, the setting is ideal, the view great, and the north winds shall carry the echoes of our battle to the ears of bards whose songs will turn us into a legend! Oh! It's going to be extraordinary! My poor fellow, you seem to have quite a few screws loose. I wonder how a guy like you was bold enough to try and seduce my wife. What?! Your wife?! I don't know what you're... Pitiful, second-rate Enutrof playboy! Yes! The Black Raven is none other than... None other than... Need a hand? Thanks. None other than... Kabrok, the merchant! Now that's something else! Aren't you rich enough already? Do you really need to go and bully some other poor merchants? That hasn't got anything to do with it! When you've had a lifetime of adventures like me, it's hard to retire. Even though I'm blessed with the most beautiful and delicate of all wives, I need to feel the wind in my hair. You should understand, as someone who spends his life adventuring. You know, if I was lucky enough to have a wife like yours I'd{\fscx150}-{\fscx200} Oh, don't believe that. You and I are the same. We crave adventure... Combat! Combat? By blowing up a few old shops? No, that's because I despise them. I'm disgusted that Miranda wants me to become like them. I'm an adventurer! Not a merchant. Ruel! Ruel, are you alright? I'm fine. Here, Ruel, your shovel. Oh, Kabrok? What're you doing here? Where's the Black Raven gone to? This may be a bit complicated for an Iop... The Black Raven is actually Kabrok, who is an ex-adventurer who married and became a merchant. Though he's apparently bored and hates the other merchants. So he dresses up and vents his frustration on other merchants and passing adventurers. Alright, now that everybody's here, we can start! Are you ready? I know you need this map. If you can beat me, it's yours. But if you lose, I'll take all your stuff and your adventure will end here! As if we're going to lose! Alright, stay grouped! There's far too many, I can't stop them all! Quick! Over here! Ruel! It's shovel time! I'm far too old to play with dolls! Fear the fire of darkness! Fear your worst nightmare! Tremble before the might of the Black Raven! Trying to fly like a piwi, little Iop? Grovy, are you alright? Goodbye, little warrior! It's not over yet, kiddo! Bravo, Yugo! You shut that bird of ill omen up! Yugo, you're really great! Thanks to you, we won! The map's ours! Congratulations, kiddo, you deserve that map. Still, poor Kabrok... Who's going to go and mend the Black Raven's broken honor? You have surprising powers, lad... and courage to boot. With some experience you'll become a terrific adventurer! It's true that I've still got a long way to go before I'm as strong as you. After all, we needed a team of five to beat you. Kabrok! Ouch! Here's a battle I've already lost... I thought you were done collecting, that I was your adventure now. But, Mimi... How do you want me to replenish our stock of rare items if I can't go shopping once in a while? You... You mean all you do is go and resupply the shop? Exactly! Oh, why didn't you say so earlier? Map! Show us Oma Island, and be quick about it! Dream on, you big oaf! Huh, what? Remember how Miranda did it! You've gotta flatter it for it to work. Oh, right... O very, very beautiful map. Show us Oma Island and be quick about it, please. Thanks! No! Wow, you really suck at flattering. I have a feeling that the map is gonna drive me crazy! {\fad(500,500)\pos(320,50)}Original subs: [EF] {\fad(500,500)\pos(320,50)}Edited subs: Wallachia
