 Episode 05: The Magnificent 5 Those Iops and their duels... Hmph! It's never brought in the cash! Taking hits for the sake of honor! I always found it to be really stupid. That's a rather cool way to look at it. Let it go, Yugo. Honor, courage, and generosity are important values in a duel between two warriors. How could an old Enutrof understand the joy that we feel when dueling an enemy face to face ? You're right. Understanding an Iop's philosophy is far too complicated for me... Ah, these two are awfully tiresome! Hey! Look over there! I'm not just dreaming this time. I finally see a village! Now we can fill our desire to shop! It looks like a nice little place. But for how long, anyway? Ogrest's chaos will end up hitting this valley as well. How will its inhabitants live without lands to farm? They'll be forced to steal, they'll be wanted by the authorities, and that'll make some big juicy bounties for old Ruel Stroud! This guy only ever thinks of getting rich at other's expense! Well, are we going, or are we going to waste time rooting ourselves to the ground here? Insolent youth! Don't blame me for trying to earn myself a living! Is there no one around this village? This must mean there are fiendish monsters lurking about! I can smell it! There are demons here! An apple? But what is i- It's a fiendish apple! A demon in disguise! Didn't you say Iops aren't afraid of anything? You're mixing fear with caution! A true Iop is always on guard! What a noble hero! More like a noble zero. There are only apples and arachnees here. By my shovel! We're not going to make any kind of fortune here! Az! Ah, you see? That's a monster isn't it? The little coward is in hiding! He must be afraid of Grovy challenging him to a duel! Huh? That's Sir Sadlygrove to you! Az. Wake up little tofu. Chirp or something... Yeah! We were right to settle here. Yay! There's some apples over there! We will let them rot so we can suck out their juicy little worms! That's a great idea! ... put them on toast! Yeah! With juicy, raw potatoes! Hey! Where do they think they are? Calm down, Yugo. I'm sure it's just a local custom. I bet they're regulars around here. Regulars? More like pillagers! And they're looting a bunch of apples? Are they idiotic or what? They're even ignoring us! I can't believe it! The villagers must have spent a long time gathering all of those apples! Hey! Stop that! Hey, kiddo... How do you like them apples? I told you guys there would be monsters! This runt is insulting us! Here we go again. What will you do with your toothpick? Clean my mouth? Is he calling me a toothpick? It may be easy to attack farmers and children, but now it's time you fought someone your own size! Go on and thrash them! I'm with you on this one. What's he saying? You know someone our size? Well, besides Daddy, I don't know any- There's Mommy too, but I wouldn't take her on! I'm gonna tan your leather! You trying to hurt our little brother?! You shouldn't have done that. We can't let Grovy fight these four monsters alone! I'm sure Sir Sadlygrove would be offended if we intervened in his fight. Kamate! Kamate! Toori! Toori! Kamate! Kamate! Is that all your feeble horns can muster?! Take this! Watch out, Evangelyne! Are my beefy little friends still feeling cocky? It's not over! We'll be back! Come on! Don't forget to take a souvenir with you. Catch! Another battle is won by Sir Sadlygrove! What? We won, didn't we? You imbecile! You're impossible! You almost turned every one of us into pulp! But what the- He's pretty handsome! Where did these little guys come from? He's a true hero! Just like Percimol! The Taures! You've really... Smashed them! Hm, yes. Sir Sadlygrove the Taure smasher! Sounds nice... No need for thanks, my little friends. It was a pleasure to help you... you... you... What exactly are you anyhow? I believe there are legends about these critters... If I recall clearly, these are Puddlings. Puddlings? They're just too cute! Imbeciles! You just made them... consumed with rage! You... you... you have condemned us to brutal retaliations! Because of you, we are cursed! What? What's he talking about? Why didn't you just stay away from the Taures? Then they would have taken what they wanted and left quietly as usual! Now, they will come back for revenge! It's gonna be dreadful! But... Never meddle with local customs! The Taures are real cowhides! They will come back and break everything! We wont be able to do anything anymore! It's funny how each time you do something, it just becomes a mega-catastrophe! But... As it would seem, we've caused enough trouble here. It's time for us to take our leave. No! We can't forsake them! If we leave this village now, the Taures will come back and reduce them to a pulp! You puddles are flat enough already, and if you turn a blind eye to these Taures what dignity will you have left? Flat puddles? Even if it means death, you can't just let them push you around! Come on! Who wants to fight back against them? Me! I'm in! Taures are lazy. They come here to your valley and help themselves because they know you let them! If you continue to just stand by and watch, your village will be no more! But what can we do? You won't stay and protect us forever! Well why not? You'll need to defend yourselves on your own. Grovy here is a very noble warrior. He'll teach you how to defend yourselves. Grovy? Sir Sadlygrove. If we don't hurry up and fortify the village, we'll run out of time. We must lay traps and be ready for an assault. Traps? Preposterous! You need to look the enemy in the eye and fight! Earn the right to overcome your fear! Otherwise I don't see the point! Didn't you see how big they were? Even if these little guys keep their consistency, all they'll win is the right to be crushed! Oh silly me, I forgot I was talking to a Cra. Go dig your little traps Evangeweasel. I wouldn't want you to break a nail during the fight! Why don't we use both options? All right! Well, if so then... I'll, uh... install... er... a surveillance system! Yugo, you can come with me! I will teach these little Puddlings the basics of fighting. You! Go grab some weapons! And you, follow me. This is absurd! Puddlings can't fight! Why should we help them? It's dirty here... ... this entire place is ugly, and it smells really bad too! Tell me, miss princess, I thought you were following Yugo due to the nobility of his soul... Yeah, well, helping jams on legs defend three apples and two potatoes... That's really not what I call nobility. This village is just too great! I'm scared! Come on, hurry up with those leaves! Bravo, Ruel, great surveillance you were! Well then, our move! Come on little marmalades, hold the rope nice and tight! Let's get down to business! Oh no! They'll take the others by surprise! Ah, no no no, you're all worthless! We're starting the training from scratch. We're in trouble! The... the Taures! They're in the village! What? Already? Finally, we're getting to the action! Proud puddling warriors! It's the moment you've all been waiting for! Ready? Let the corrida begin! Charge! We need to get out of here fast or else we'll be trampled! But... But what about Grovy? Have you ever tried to prevent an Iop from fighting?! Ready the sauce! The steaks are about to be cooked! Come on! I'm waiting for you! What? Where did they go? Yay! Chocolate! Dried gobball! I'm waiting for you! Come, you cowards! They didn't come for revenge! We can just let them take what they want- Never! We promised the puddlings we would help them! Okay! Come on puddlings, come get us out of here now. Please! You're safe! That... that's not for certain. Get us out of this thing, quick! Come on! Show yourselves! I'll take you all on at once! This time you won't have us by surprise. Grovy! Watch out! Lil' puddling, are you alright? I saw your efforts! Congratulations! You saved Grovy! I... I didn't really... It was just a reflex... Sir Sadlygrove could very well have done it himself. No, no, don't you see? You saved him! Here we are! Great! Here comes the cavalry! You saw that. You can defend yourself just fine. We are Puddlings! Pacifist creatures, not warriors! But Percimol wouldn't let himself be walked all over. Percimol is just a myth! If you guys aren't afraid, then you can hit them... and if you are afraid, then- splash! You turn into puddles and become untouchable! One moment you're here, the next you're not. Oh. Hey, yes! That's clever. You mean, completely retarded! Nothing they explained to us has worked! I trust them! Drop that! Yeah! Stop it! Stop it everyone! Appy-apples app-appy-apples... Stop it! We won't stop. We will crush everything. I said, "Stop it!" Man... If he's getting into it... The village will be saved! Nevermind... Yeah! It's Daddy! I am Clout, almighty leader of the Taure people. Where is my lunch? There goes the Puddlings courage... We just have to show them one can overcome his fear! Are you the one that made the Puddlings rebel? Wait, I have an idea! Hey, you, the calfskin! Wanna duel with me? You want to fight against me? You're not serious... I am serious! You're just afraid of losing to a little boy! Even the puddlings are more courageous than you! Huh? So Daddy's afraid? Be serious. Daddy isn't afraid! Hey, sometimes, he gets real frightened in front on Mom. Shut up! Silence! You've backed yourself up against a wall, kiddo. Yeah, you'll see if I'm afraid... Come on little ones, get to it! So who wants to place bets on Clout?! ... Nice confidence. Any bets on Yugo? They're ready to fight! Just a second... Why you... Don't mess with the bull, kiddo. You'll get the horns! Who's the butcher now? Now you'll see who the head cheese is! Silence! Shoot! We'll have to be quiet about this to Mom. And we'll have to do our, "shopping" elsewhere. We are indebted to you. We don't have much to offer... ... but you can take all the provisions you need. The Taures aren't that evil, you can share with them from now on. We only nee- He's right. Make a deal with 'em. Since they're so strong, they can help you in exchange for a share of the harvest. As for us, we need a bit of supply for our travel. Handsome knight, could... Could you remain here? But all the excitement is gone, now! Iop-brain! You were right my little Yugo. It's good to help people. We meet new people... and it's very, very rewarding. I wonder if we should do this helping thing a bit more often?
