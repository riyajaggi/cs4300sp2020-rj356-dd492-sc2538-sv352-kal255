 # Down by the banks of the Hanky Panky # Where the bullfrogs leap from bank to banky # With a hip, hop, hippity-hop # Leap off a lily pad and go kerplop # Down in the jungle where nobody goes # There's a boogie-woogie washerwoman washing her clothes # With a bip, bop, bippity-bop # She's got a wooden clothes peg and she's got your nose! # (BOTH GIGGLE) Who gave you that? Mr Fitzgerald.

 Frederica! - Lily! - Frederica! (SEARCHERS SHOUT OUT) Lily! Frederica! Lily! BABA: It's 5am. We should rest for a few hours before we start. - Wow! - Janet inherited it from her father. It's completely beautiful. And secluded. We can bury the body here. No-one will find it. Key? Baba? Key?

 Under the lantern. I enjoyed watching you sleep. Aww... That's creepy. Can I tell you something? Yeah, of course. You're the first woman I've made love to in six years. Six years? - Dude, what the fuck? - You're surprised? You genuinely have no idea how hot you are, do you? It's really quite sweet. I hope I was worth the wait. VOICEMAIL: Freddy, this is DI Jackson Mendy. If you could give me a call back, please, when you get this. We'd like to ask you one or two more questions. - Thank you very much. - What about the background check? - Dom's on the case. - OK. Well, I thought we could go back to the club tonight, ask around about Matt and Freddy. Er, yeah. I'll just have to check plans with Gill. Mm-hm. - Is that a problem? - No. No. It's just I've never seen anyone as under the thumb as you, is all. (CHUCKLES) Under the thumb! We're a team, Gill and I. If anything - we're under each other's thumbs, in a kind of perpetual Escherian bliss. What's Ed Sheeran got to do with it? What? - Not Ed Sheeran. Escherian. - I don't know, do I? I don't know what you're talking about half the bloody time! - Come on. We'd better head out. - MC Escher? We're meeting Matt's boyfriend in ten minutes in a caff, so come on. He did those prints of the hands that are drawing each other... Have you got a photo of Simon, please, to show him? He does those famous prints of the never-ending stairs. Oh, don't talk to me about never-ending stairs! The amount of time I've spent standing in corridors waiting for you, sunshine! (JACKSON LAUGHS) (GRUNTS) (SIGHS) (GROANS) (GROANS) Baba? (VOICES ECHO) (FAINTLY) Baba? Baba. There you go. All clean. (KISSES) This man did nothing wrong. And now he's dead. Well, sometimes people end up in the wrong place at the wrong time. You know that more than anyone. I feel sorry for him. Of course I do. But you did what you had to, and I'm proud of you for that. Come on. I'll help you finish digging. We are nearly done, though, right? I mean, how deep does it have to be? - We need to make sure... - (SCREAMS) (GASPS) (GROANS) (STRAINS) (KEY TURNS IN LOCK) Look, I... I won't try anything, I promise. OK? Hey. Come on. Hey. Please! (KEY TURNS IN LOCK) He saw Matt. He's seen our faces. What are we doing? I felt his breath leave his body. I felt him die in my arms. And then he came back. I think it's a sign. It's a sign that he's a wiry little fucker, that's all. Look, I met you eight days ago, and I love you more than anyone or anything I've ever known. Tell me that's not a sign. - Matt couldn't have killed this guy. - Have another look. I'm telling you, Matt was home on Sunday night with a fuck-off dirty cold. You don't think there's any chance he was lying? What, do you want me to go home and get the bin full of snotty tissues next to his bed? There's fucking Lemsip wrappers in the bin. I haven't even had the chance to clean up yet. I've just... Take your time. He wouldn't need to lie to me, anyway. We weren't exclusive. He...he can do what he wants. Does the name Freddy Lane mean anything to you? No. Who's he? And you're sure you've never seen this man before? What line of business was Matt involved in? He had something new every week. Proper little Del Boy, you know? Like Straight-to-Third-Date? Yeah. Why, are you on there? Did he run the website by himself? No, he had a partner who did all the computer stuff. Could you give me their name - and number? - Sure. Good. Look, I'm very sorry to have to ask you this, Leo, but, erm, was Matt into anything...alternative? Sexually. You're gonna have to be a bit more specific than that. Feet. Did he like feet? No more than the next person. So he never drew anything on the soles of your feet? Why would he draw on the soles - of my feet? - Doesn't matter. - Anything else you'd like to tell us? - Yeah. Look... I knew Matt for 18 months. He wouldn't do something like this. He texted me on the night. Said he had something to do and then he was coming over to mine. Did he say what? No. Why didn't you raise the alarm when he didn't turn up? Matt's flaky like that. He says he's gonna turn up and he never does. And he drives me fucking mental. But he was happy, you know? He loved life. He wouldn't... He wouldn't just... (GROANS SOFTLY) It's OK. It's OK. So he's our guest now? I know this isn't easy. I understand how hard it is for you, Baba... I'm sorry, Freddy, but we've been given a second chance. We haven't been given anything, Baba. Our whole lives. That's the point. We're our second chance, me and you, - and if you really loved me, then... - Love heals, Freddy, and grows. Doesn't destroy. That's lovely, Baba, but it's hard to grow in a fucking prison cell, isn't it? I have killed many innocent men in my life. I will not kill another. So it was just you and Matt who run the whole business? It's just a website and a membership database. It's not hard. Actually, I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to do now. I keep going now, or what? You don't charge a membership fee, so how did you monetise it? I mean, yes, it's free to join, but Matt used to deal with that stuff. He called it premium membership. - Premium membership? - It's pretty simple, really. There are certain profiles, like member profiles, on the site. They're the same as everyone else, really, except you have to pay to unlock them. - How much? - Depends. - How much for Zara? - You mean Freddy? Mm-hm. I don't know, I'd have to check, but I think she was maybe £400. - (SCOFFS) - You're telling me that people pay £400 just for a little chinwag? Chinwag? £400 for a chat is a lot of money, don't you think? Like I say, I just manage the database. Matt dealt with all that stuff. Hmm. He'd have had a personal relationship with Freddy? I like this word "chinwag". It's funny. Answer the question, please. - Which? - Did Matt know Freddy? Probably. He knew all the premium girls. How would you describe your relationship with Matt? Right now? Pretty non-existent. Wow. Erm, well, I think that'll be all for now, so, er, thank you very much for your time, Paula. Have a good day. Yeah. You too. Think of anything, let us know. (PHONE RINGS) Hi, Dom. I managed to get a work address for Freddy. Do you want it now? Right. Yes. Sorry. Just give me a minute. LOLA: I want the business accounts, membership records and anything you can get on Matt's personal finances. Yes. Uh-huh. Yes, exactly. Mm-hm. Fire away. Er, yeah, Thanks, Dom. Keep digging. Whatever you can find. Thanks. Sorry, I was just looking for something to write on. Can you not go through my things, please? It's rude. Of course. Yeah. Sorry. No, no, no! No, look! Wait, wait. Please, please! Please! I'm not trying anything. Please. I just... I just want to show you. This is my boy - Taylor. He got diagnosed with leukaemia three months ago. He's in St Thomas' now, fighting with everything he's got. I promise you... ...on my son's life, I will not go to the police. Just don't keep me away from him. Please. (TEARFULLY) Don't keep me away from my boy. Please. Please... FREDDY: He's lying, you know. If he cared so much about his supposedly sick kid, then why's he stumbling around a forest, pissed, on a Thursday night? I meant what I said, you know, last night. About me and you. You don't have to say it back, but you could at least acknowledge it. That was really hard for me to say. Well, fuck you, then! I'll do it myself. I know you, Freddy. - You won't do it. - Yeah? Watch me. (SHE RUNS UPSTAIRS) (DOOR OPENS) (VOICES ECHO) MAN: She hasn't been in for a couple of days. Can I ask what this is about? JACKSON: We can't discuss the details, I'm afraid. Did she give you a reason for her absence? (SCOFFS) Have you met Freddy? She'll float in here in a couple days with some bullshit excuse, which I'll have to accept, because I can't afford to sack her. And why's that? We get three times as many client requests for Freddy than anyone. Last week, she kept a guy on the phone for an hour and a half. I listened in at one point. He was baring his soul. Crying like a child, he was. What can I say? People love her. Because she cares about them? Or maybe cos we pay commission. You had her down to work on Sunday night. Was she here? No. And she didn't give a reason why? Like I said. No, thanks. I'm not hungry. You should eat. Thank you. I'm Darren, by the way. Thank you. What's your name? Where... Where are you from? You don't have to tell me. I was just... You seem like a good guy, that's all. It's nice. Thank you. Thank you. (SIREN WAILS OUTSIDE) (PHONE BEEPS) (SIGHS) VOICEMAIL: Hi, this is Melanie calling from The Talk Shop. We've got some deals... MAN: Oi! Are you coming in today, or what? Or am I to assume you're off gallivanting...? Fuck off. Freddy, this is DI Jackson Mendy. If you could give me a call back, please, when you get this. We'd like to ask you one or two more questions. Thank you very much. Initial background check on Freddy shows no previous record or warrant, but everything I can find on her - bank accounts, phone records, employment, home address - none of it goes back past 2013. Maybe she moved here from somewhere else. Have you looked at her Facebook? But that's the thing. She doesn't have any other social media profile whatsoever, other than the dating stuff. I thought kids her age have to tell the whole world every time they eat a cheese sandwich. Unless you're entirely convinced of your own superiority, in which case there's no need, is there? Well, maybe. Or maybe she's just got no friends. Do you want me to keep looking? Do what you can. Don't drive yourself mad. Kay's working late tonight. She said she might have some stuff from Matt's laptop. OK, well, let me know. OK. Erm, Lola? Mm-hm? I'd like to thank you for making my transition into the department so smooth. Er, I feel like I'm learning so much from you, so... Thanks. Have a good night. Mm-hm. You too. (PHONE RINGS) (MUTTERS QUIETLY) Freddy. Thanks so much for calling me back. What's wrong with this thing? (KNOCK ON WINDOW) Come on, guys. I know there are budget cuts and everything, but is this the best you could do? I feel like I've lost on The Apprentice. Take a seat, Freddy. - Coffee, darling? - Yes, please, sweetie! What kind? Whatever the house recommends. So...I guess you wanna know why I lied about Matt. Here we are. - Beautiful. - Cheers. So you're saying that Straight-to-Third-Date is actually an escort service? No. I was a member of a dating website, just like everyone else. So Matt wasn't paying you to sleep with these men? No. I'm paid a retainer to be a member. Right. But he's not going to keep paying you if you don't put out. Well, it's a grey area, I suppose, which is why I lied about Matt. So, to be clear, Matt knew Simon through this, er, premium membership scheme? Yes. Matt had a personal relationship with all premium members, but he was obsessed with Simon. They slept together once, and then he wouldn't leave him alone. There wasn't a single piece of evidence on Simon's laptop to suggest he was gay. I think it was his first time. He seemed confused. It was really quiet sweet. Not a single internet search. Ever. Why are you asking me? I had a couple of drunk nights out with Simon. But I knew Matt quite well. Doesn't surprise me at all what happened. Why do you say that? Well, some people just have a darkness inside them. You can feel it. You were supposed to be at work on Sunday night, but you didn't show up. Why? Didn't feel like it. You didn't feel like it? Do you want me to say it again? - Where did you grow up? - Why do you want to know that? Just trying to build a picture. Hmm. Why are we doing this here and not down at the station? Well, you're just a witness. We thought it would be more comfortable here. OK. So I can leave whenever I want? Of course. OK. LOLA: Before you leave, would you mind giving us your fingerprints? Just for elimination purposes, of course. Do I have to? No. But people with nothing to hide usually don't mind. OK, yeah, That makes sense. Sure. - OK. - Hmm. No worries. Happy to help. Right, well. Well, I'll see you guys around, yeah? (DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES) - Please! Hello! - (FOOTSTEPS) I really need the toilet. I can't hold it in. I'm so sorry. Please. Please. - I need the toilet. I can't... - This is your address? Yeah. Look... Please. I'm gonna piss myself. Please. Come on. - (CUTTING) - (DARREN GASPS) (UNZIPS TROUSERS) Could you hold it, please? Please? Thank you. - (TRICKLING) - (DARREN GASPS) Thank you. I'll pray... I'll pray for you... (TRICKLING CONTINUES) ...every...every day... ...if you let me go. I'll pray for you, like I pray for my boy. The man you saw last night... I didn't see. I was drunk. - I...I didn't see... - He was a pimp and a gangster. Do you understand? I just want to see my family. - (ZIPS TROUSERS) - That's all I want. Please... Hands. Please... (TIGHTENS CABLE TIES) (DOOR CLOSES AND KEY TURNS) (SOBS) You're doing pick-up tomorrow, right? If you can't, can you just say now? I don't think it's fair on Mum to keep asking at short notice. I'll be there tomorrow. I promise. (PHONE RINGS) (SIGHS) It's 10pm. You're lucky I'm still awake. We found an encrypted file on Matt's laptop. It has details of all premium members on it. OK. What have you...what have you found? Matt's accounts show that Freddy owed him ten grand. We've got ourselves a motive. (SOFT THUDDING) (PHONE RINGS) - Baba, it's me. - Where...where have you been? - I'm in London. - What? Why? Tell me you're not using your phone. No. I'm in a phone box. All this time, I...I've been... I needed to clear my head. Baba, the police came to see me. They know I lied about Matt, and they were asking all these questions. What did you say? Nothing, but they know something. I could tell. After I spoke to them, I went to St Thomas' Hospital. I bought flowers and everything. There's no kid called Taylor on the children's ward. He's lying to you, Baba, and you're letting him. (DIGGING) (FAINT SINGING) - Freddy owed Matt ten grand. - OK. - It's a motive, surely? - Not necessarily. - Susan... - No, Jackson. We know they had a business relationship. - She told us as much. - Only after we pushed her. You shouldn't even be working this case, should you? I thought we agreed. New evidence has come to light. We think it's worth... No. It's not enough, and you both know it. There isn't a single piece of forensic evidence. She's lied to us repeatedly. With good reason. Wouldn't you have lied in her position? I mean, why are you so convinced? - If you just met her, ma'am... - (SHOUTS) Excuse me?! There's no reason for me to meet her, is there? That's the point. Can either of you remind me of a single time in this job when the most obvious answer hasn't also been the correct one? OK. Here's an easier one for you. Matt Bowers is 14 stone, so how on earth did a woman the size of Freddy get him in that tree? No. Shut it down, Jackson. - OK? - OK, ma'am. Mm. What more does she want? We've proved Freddy lied. - We've given her a motive... - For Matt, yes. - But what about Simon? - What about Simon? Why would she kill him? They've only been out twice. OK, OK. OK, so Simon invites her back to his place. They have sex, right? Things get out... Things get out of hand, she kills him. Why? Because maybe... Maybe Matt... ...asked her to. - (SCOFFS) - We know that they had an argument. Yeah? Maybe... Maybe Matt told Freddy to do it. Right, so Matt gets Freddy to kill Simon? - Yeah. - For some unknown reason. - Uh-huh. - Which she does happily. - Yeah. - And then... ...what, turns around and kills Matt straight after? Exactly! To cover her tracks. Which brings us back to the tree. Look, I don't know how she got him in the fucking tree, OK? Maybe she threatened him. Maybe she got some help. - I don't know that. - No, you don't. - And neither do I. - Come on, Jackson. - Whose side are you on here? - On your side. I'm on your side. I just... I've been asked to shut this down, and right now I don't have enough reasons to say no. Fine. Fine. What do you think? At this point, with what we have, I think it's impossible to say either way. What do you feel? What do you feel? (KNOCK ON DOOR) - Sorry to interrupt. - No, it's fine. Go ahead. Um, well, I found out why there's nothing to learn about Freddy - past a certain point. - Sorry, Dom, haven't you heard? Case is closed. Please. Please. Well, she spent five years in juvenile detention from 12 to 17 for GBH. Except her name wasn't Frederica back then. It was Lily Jenkins. (THUNDER RUMBLES) (CLATTERING) (PANTS) Babeni... (GASPS) (COCKEREL CROWS) (KEY TURNS IN LOCK) No, Baba, please. Please no. What are you doing? (TIES RIP) No... Please, where are we...? Where are you taking me? No! No! Please. Please! No. No! (BABA GRUNTS) Stand up. (WHIMPERS) Stand up! Look around you very carefully. This grave is for you and your family if you ever go to the police. - Do you understand? - Yes. I-I understand. I promise I won't. I-I under... I understand. Your hands. On Thursday night, you were mugged and beaten unconscious. You woke up in the forest near your home this morning. You remember nothing. Do you understand? I'm sorry. That path will lead you through the woods, back to the roads. Hey! Go now. Thank you. Yes... (GASPS) (HORN BLARES) (TYRES SQUEAL) (MUSIC FROM LORRY) (VEHICLE APPROACHES) (MUSIC FROM CAR) Hmm. Hey. Hey! Before you say anything, I want to tell you... ...I let Darren go. I could not do it. - I do not think he'll go to the police. - You don't know that, do you, Baba? This was not like the others. This was different. We were given a sign. So it was God that let Darren go, was it? Not you? Hmm? How am I meant to trust you after this, Baba? Hmm? How am I meant to be with you? How's this supposed to work? Because I was a boy when they stole me from my home and forced me to fight. And I've been trying for so long to get back to that boy I was before all the killing. But I can't do it alone. I've tried. I can't do it. Look, I've been waiting for you, Freddy. I think you've been waiting for me too, but it has to mean something. This thing between us. It has to. And it still can. OK. OK. (DRINK POURS) You're hoping that's like a Magic Eye drawing, right? You stare at the same thing for long enough and hard enough, and an entirely new image will appear. Sounds like the definition of madness. - Hmm. - No. That's working late without tea. (JACKSON CHUCKLES) But at least that's something I can help you with. Oh, thanks, my love. Look, I promise I won't make a habit of this. It's just...Lola. She's someone you don't want to let down, you know? Hmm... I'd like to meet her. - Yeah? - Yeah. It'd be great. Green tea, yeah? Jackson? Jackson? Er, sorry. I just need to make a phone call. (LINE RINGS) Would you mind to drive? I didn't sleep last night. Yeah, sure. We'll, uh, burn the car and split up. It's safer that way. I don't think we should be seen together in London either. For a few days at least. We'll find him... ...that little boy. If he's still in there, we'll find him. I promise. (KNOCK ON DOOR) - (KNOCK ON DOOR) - Who is it? JACKSON: Uh, it's me. I'm so sorry. I tried calling. - Jackson? - Yeah. Can I come in? Yeah! Yeah, gimme... Gimme a sec. Just gimme... Gimme a sec. You... You look mint. - What's going on? - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I tried calling. I called and called, and then in the end, I got your address from Dom. - Yeah. - You OK? You look ill. No, I had a few drinks when I got home. Conked out. You know what it's like. - What's going on, then? - OK. Do you remember when we first went to see Freddy, she made me a cup of tea? Green tea. I remember, yeah. Freddy already had the mug ready. When we came in the room, she already was making two cups of tea. Tell me you remember. Please. Lola? Yes. So what? She knew we were on our way up. If she saw both of us on the intercom, she would have either made one cup of tea for herself, or three for all of us. Two doesn't make sense. There was someone else there. BABA: You're telling me two police officers come round talking about a homicide, and you just sit in the room? You don't come out to find out what's going on? - Of course you would. They always do. - Unless you're hiding. Unless you don't want to be seen. That's how she got Matt into that tree. You were right. She's working with someone.
