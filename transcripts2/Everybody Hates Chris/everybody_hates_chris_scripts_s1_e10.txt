Every time I turn one the TV, my sister wants to watch the care bears, That's a ladies show by the way. I'm sure having bothers and sisters would be pretty cool. I mean, instead I get toys. I got an Atari. Wait, you got an Atari! Atari was the playstation in 1982. We got one in 1984. We didn't get a game till 1987. Yep! Just got it! We didn't have any electronic game, but we had singing into a fan. Sometime, my mother would trick us in the work, opportunely we were playing the game. Who wants to play: clean up this damn house? I wanted to take the garbage out competition four years in a row. Hey! You want to come over to my house after school? No. I think I should go home. Oh, come on. Forget about that. I live a couple blocks away. Okay. Just one game won't hurt! Right? - Hey baby! - Hey babe! How you doin? Good. You want something to eat? Aren't you supposed to be at work?

My man has two jobs, And you ain't no damn eight. Get her an eleven! You sure you don't want something? No, I grabbed some breakfast with the guys. I'm pretty tired. I'm just going to grab a shower and get some sleep. Julius? Yeah? Well, I was just thinking, hum. Since we have the house ourselves, maybe we can, do something, we don't usually get to do What do you have in mind? My dad liked game shows. Come on sister, you can do it.

I want the first bid from Bennet Four hundred dollars. It's good, it's good. You're right, you're right. 625. 625. You're fool if you pay that much. 580. What is a man doing at eleven o'clock in the morning? You ain't no job? 430 dollars. My father was like Rainman when it came to guess how much something cost. How do you know that? We don't even own a dishwasher! Cause' it cost $430. Greg's house was a lot different that what I expected. I used to think all white people are rich. I thought his house would look more like this: And the Wuligers parleyed their fortune in the millions. And this fabulous estate in Brooklyn. I hate these plastic covers! Especially in summer. They get your legs all sweaty and make them stick. My mum uses these plastic covers so much she put on a second set to make sure the first set look nice. Hey! Where's you mum? I live with my dad. They split up. I had she didn't really get along. Actually she run off for Greg?s uncle. That's another episode on a different show. Yes! That's all right! You better be happy I don't have one of these. Else I'd be tearing you up! I got to go. Hey, you want to come back over to my house tomorrow? You lucky I'm leaving now! I see you tomorrow. When my mother was gossiping, nothing else matter. Even my father sleepin' So he takes you to dinner. And orders a Chikuwa special. And he said what? Rochelle! Rochelle! I got to go to work in a few hours, OK? OK. Alright STOP! Julius, you got to hear this. You know that guy Marcus? That works for UPS with the stinky come-on. He took Sheila to the movies, bought this big old thing of popcorn, two hot dogs, she asked for just a little piece, he told her no! - Sheila say "Hi", baby. - Hey Sheila. Oh girl! He's trying to sleep. He'd better have big feet be catchy. My dad hate losing sleep. But he was happy when she talks to her girlfriend. That way he didn't have to to it. Julius, you're not gonna believe this! You know the girl Jody Watley that used to be on the Soul Train? Well, I heard that she's leaving the group Shalamar, and start a new group without Fernand Simpson. Can you believe that? - That's something! - Ain't it!? I stopped listening at Jody Watley. Right. Julius, you smell smoke? No... I... When smoke? Oh no, he try to sleep. CHRIS! Sheila, let me call you back. OK. Chris! What in the world? Move, girl... Tonya what are you doing? - Chris did it! - Chris! Chris isn't here. - Oh, where is he? - I don't know. Who put this pot on the stove? Wasn't me. Because of those two words, Drew never got in trouble. Who tore up my backseat? Wasn't me. Who left my nickel lain out here on the sidewalk? Wasn't me. - Who spilled these oatmeal? - Wasn't me. Would you believe those were is first words? Tonya, what is this mess girl? I was trying to make hot chocolate. I don't you fooling around with this hot chocolate, do you hear me? Now get upstairs, before I make your behind hot! I thought I'd see George Bush in a do-rag before Tonya got in trouble. And where were you? You're late. My bus broke down. Next time, you better get of and fix it. Yes mum. All right, I admit it. I'm hooked. I felt so good to see Tonya gets in trouble yesterday, What they did to her? - My mum knocked all her teeth out. - Really? No, she just sent her upstairs to her room. But I wish would have smashed her teeth off. Yes! Oh, man, it's four thirty. Four thirty! You got to go! I'm not supposed to have any company over. If my dad found out you're in here, he's gonna kill me. No! You got to hide! Hide! I can't hide! I got to go. If I don't get home, my mum's gonna kill me. Chris, I'm serious! Chris, you got to hide. Greg looked at me like his father was Ike Turner. Go! Go! Go! Get in there. As soon as the couch is clear, I snick you at the back Who are you talking to? Talking to myself. If you're lonely, I get you a gerbil. Get ready for dinner. I get to get out of here. When is Chris coming home? I don't know. Why? Because I want to cut the hair of my doll's head. But I won't do it until he is here. Without me in the house to blame, Tonya actually had to act right - Is Chris here yet? - Nope. Damn! - Is Chris home yet? - No. Damn! - Is Chris here yet? - No. Damn! I sure will be glad when Chris gets back. Chris? Chris? While I was hiding in the closet, the only thing I could thing about, was getting the hell out of there and getting home. The biggest difference between being in a black neighborhood and a white neighborhood, is that the black guys will beat you up and rob you. The white guys just beat you up. Even I was scared, I figured the best way to get through this, was to act like I belong. Get out of here! What do we got here! Watermelon keeps walking. You got to... They come out with this stuff. Watch your back! Gregory. You got dent sole in my sofa. You sit in one spot. And can you drink out of one glass? This is like CSI in Brooklyn. Gregory. Did you have somebody over here? I told you. No company when I'm not here. Dad, I had my friend Chris over after school. We played video games and stuffs. Next time, you want to have somebody in here, you ask first, you understand!? Dad. He's still here. - Chris? - Chris is home. - Is Chris here yet? - No. - Who cut you doll's hair off? - It wasn't me. Julius, wake up. Julius! A thousand seven hundred and sixty two dollars and ninety five. Julius! What! Did you win? Chris isn't home yet. Did you check his room? I looked all over the house. He's not here. He should have been home a long time ago. Do you think Chris is dead? In my neighborhood, being fifteen minutes late, could mean you dead. He's not dead. He's just late. Still no dead! Hey! Chris! Do you know this kid? Yeah, sure. You know that guy? - Let's go! - Hold on! Get in! Did he said he was doing something after school? No. He was just supposed to pick up in the dry clean. Maybe it wasn't done yet. I see if he is over here. Chris! Chris, oh thank goodness, are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay. I'm so happy you're alright. I'm a kill you! Where have you been boy? Who are you?

I'm over here, worried sick, and you're just hanging out. Have you lost your mind? If you go over somebody's house, you get to let somebody know. They don't have a phone in Greg's house? Look, I don't care where you are You be like E.T., you phone home! I need to know, where you are, who you with, and what you?re doing. How I know you're not out these selling drugs? I mean, you could be kingpin in a Columbian drug cartel for all I know. I'm not out these selling drugs. You do I know that? My mother had one golden leit for her kids. Don't sell drugs! As long as they weren't doing that, almost everything else was okay. Mam, you're boy shot the mayor. - Did he sell drug? - No. Get in here boy.
