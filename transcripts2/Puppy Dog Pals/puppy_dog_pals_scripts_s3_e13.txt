 Rolly: ♪ Hello, cows, out here by the road ♪ ♪ I really hope you moo ♪ Bingo: ♪ We're on a long road trip, and if you moo we'll flip ♪ ♪ Hello, cows out here by the road, badadadada ♪ (pups giggling) Are... Are you singing that cow song again? Yeah! Sing with us, Hissy! I do sort of like that song. (pups howling) (meowing) [♪♪] Bob: We're here! Hello, Texas! Ha ha! I can't wait to do some line dancing. Ha ha! Rolly: Line dancing? What is it? It's a kind of dancing where everyone does the same steps together. Rolly: Ooh, fun! Howdy! I'm here for line dancing. It's my delight to be at your service. Name's Amos Flats. Welcome to the Cowboy Way Dance Hall, where we do things the cowboy way! (strumming a tune) Thanks. Huh. People here are so nice! We're so excited to have you dance with us today! Only rule here: every dancer's gotta be in full cowboy or cowgirl attire! It's the cowboy way! (strumming a tune) Look at them here on their trusty steeds. They're great at ropin', ridin', and line dancin'. Yee haw! You've got a cowboy hat, a cowboy-style shirt, and... (horrified gasp) No cowboy boots! Cowboy boots? But I don't have any of those. Oh, you're in good hands. I have an extra pair right here, just in case. Just slip off your shoes, and... Oh, no. This can't be! These are way too big. They won't work at all! Oh. Well, I really wanted to line dance in Texas, Mr. Amos. Isn't there anything you can do? Well, I'll see what I can find in the back, but... Oh, dear. Oh, dear. (sighs) Dear, oh, my. Oh! If I don't find some cowboy boots, my line dancing day is over! Looks like you pups have a mission. Yeah. We'll go find the perfect cowboy boots for Bob so he can line dance. (clattering) (nervous chuckle) Uh, how's it going back there? Uh, need a hand or anything? (clattering) Aah! Yeah! Yes, please! Let's take this, so when we find cowboy boots, we can make sure they're the perfect size. (whirring) Perfect! So where do we find cowboy boots? Ooh! We'll get some from a cowboy! Who'd know where to find cowboys? Cows! It's right in the name! Let's ask the cows we saw before. - Bye, Hissy! - Good luck with that. Hmm. This boot might be a comfy spot for a nap. (sniffs) Yuck! Ugh! Holy moly! Bingo: Here we are! - Cows! - Excuse me, cows! - Hello? - Huh. (mooing) Hi! Hmm. They don't seem to understand. Ahem. Hi. We are Rolly and Bingo. We are looking for a cowboy, and thought you might be able to help us. Have any of you seen one? (moos softly) Maybe they don't understand us. Josie: We sure do, buckaroos. We just don't like to talk with our mouths full. Name's Josie. You're lookin' for a cowboy. I saw one the other day. Went that-a-way with another herd of cows. He and his horse, they were just ropin' and ridin'. Ooh, sure looked fun! They're far away by now. Out on the range. And the trail there's rough. Wherever he is, we gotta find him. It's really, really important. What if I take ya? You'd do that for us? But don't you have a bunch of... cow-y things to do? Well, truth is, being a cow's great, but I see those horses and their saddles, with their cowboys ropin' and ridin' on their backs, and, oh, it looks so fun! (sighs) I always dream about what it'd be like to be one of those horses. What do you mean, Josie? Maybe this is my chance to stop dreamin', and start doin'! If you'll be cowboys, I'll be your horse! All right! Let's get you a saddle. (laughs) Already got one! See? - Wow! - Cool! Saddle up, pups! - (Josie neighing) - (pups cheering gleefully) Josie: Aah. The wide open range! Nothin' like the cowboy life. Yeah. And we're getting pretty good at riding. Huh, Bingo? Uh... Muh... I don't know if I'm cut out for this cowboy thing. Sure, you are. You just gotta relax. Get loose. Relax. Loose, like a noodle. Hey! I'm doing it! I'm riding! Am I riding? You're practically a cowboy. Yeah. That means crossing this here river will be no sweat. Say what now, brown cow? I think the cowboy and his other herd are on the other side of this here river. So, is there, like, a bridge, or... Josie: Can't go over it. Can't go under it. We have to go... through it? That's right. - Bingo: Aah! - Rolly: Whee! (splashing) Woo-hoo! Woo. Boy, howdy. (grunts) Oh! (sighs) How y'all doin' back there? Pretty good, actually. - These cowboys know... Aah! - (splashing) - Bingo: Oh, no! - Bingo! Bingo! (splashing) - Rolly! - We gotta do something fast, or that river will carry him away! I have an idea. Don't worry, Rolly! We got you! (grunting) Reel me in, Bingo! - (grunting) - (rope stretching) - (yelling) Whoa! - Oh, no! - (Rolly yelling) - (splashing) (pups panting) Let's puppy dog do this! Hey, Josie! Catch! (grunts) I got it! (Josie grunting) Josie, you are good. You saved us, Josie. Hoo-whee! I sure could get used to this being-a-horse thing! So, where is that cowboy? Hoss: I see a pair of cowboys right here! Who? Us? I saw you pups riding that cow. Riding like you've been doing it your whole life. And then that rope rescue? Woo-whee! You're almost as good as my human, Hank, here, and he's a cowboy. (snoring) Woo-ha! Hey! Your Hank snores like Bob! He sure can, can't he? Oh, you don't have to whisper, though. You won't wake him. He had a real big day so far. He's real tired. Maybe you can help us. We're looking for a cowboy, so we can bring back a pair of cowboy boots for our human, Bob. He needs boots, or else he can't go line dancing. Whatever that is. Line dancing? I love line dancing! I've been wondering how to line dance all day. Do you know how? Do I? Hold onto your hats! Or my dancin' feet will blow 'em right off! (country music playing) Woo! All right! - (mooing) - ♪ Let's all get together ♪ ♪ Line up real straight ♪ ♪ Turn up that country music, We can move to the beat ♪ ♪ To the same steps as the dancer dancing next to you ♪ ♪ Toes all tapping in time ♪ ♪ Line dancing's what it sounds like ♪ ♪ Everybody dance in a line ♪ Oh! That makes sense. Here we go now! Hoss and Josie: ♪ Dip back, turn around ♪ ♪ Drop a knuckle to the ground ♪ Hoss: ♪ We're doing all the moves together ♪ Hoss and Josie: ♪ Don't think too much about it ♪ ♪ Just step one step at a time, yeah ♪ ♪ Line dancing's what it sounds like ♪ ♪ Everybody dance in a line ♪ ♪ Line dancing's what it sounds like ♪ ♪ Everybody dance ♪ ♪ Line dancing's what it sounds like ♪ ♪ Everybody dance ♪ ♪ Line dancing's what it sounds like ♪ ♪ Everybody dance in a line ♪ (mooing) - (neighs) - Woo-hoo! Yeah! I officially love line dancing. I see why Bob's so disappointed that he might not get to do it. Oh, right. We still haven't found any cowboy boots for Bob. Hoss: Oh, about that. I can tell you pups really love your Bob. I love my Hank, too. - Look at him over there. - (snoring) He's a cowboy, you know, and... Why, these are his old cowboy boots. I'd be honored to give 'em to you two pups. And they're just Bob's size. I don't know what to say. Josie, Hoss, thanks for everything. (whirring) No, thank you. You are a pair of fine cowboys. And Josie, you make one doozy of a horse. I knew I would. Happy trails, Hoss! That sure was one good day. Ha ha! (snoring) (sighs) Well, Mr. Amos, I guess I just wasn't meant to line dance. I can't believe it. I am so sorry. There, there, Amos. Much obliged. (sobbing) (barking) Bob! Bob! (clanging) Sorry, Hissy. Meh. It was a boring dream, anyway. So, did you find cowboy boots for Bob? You bet we did! - (whirring) - Bob! Bob! Look! (barking) - Bob: Hissy, Rolly, Bingo. What is it? Huh. I don't remember trying these on. Wait a sec. Ha ha! These are just my size! - (laughs) - Just your size? It's a Cowboy Way miracle! (both laughing and cheering) Bob: Woo-hoo! - (country music playing) - (all laughing and cheering) We did it, Rolly. We accomplished our mission, and got Bob line dancing, like he wanted. Hold onto your hat, or my line dancing feet will blow it right off. - Woo-hoo! Oh, yeah! - (all clapping) (all chattering, cheering) Episode Part 2 >>> Bingo and Rolly: (Reads) Title: "Tik Tok, Broken Clock" [♪♪] (yawns) Ah. We were in the bus for so long, I just gotta stretch my puppy legs. (grunts) Aah! Okay. That's better. Aah. A new town to explore. (gasps) And there's the clock tower I read about - in my travel book! - (shrieks) - I can't wait to check it out. - (phone beeping) - Aah! - (beeping) Uncle Hans! How are things in your cuckoo clock workshop in Germany? Oh, things are great, Bob. I know how much you love seeing the new clocks I make, so I wanted to show you my latest one. Hold on! - (barking) - Rolfi! - Rolfi! - Hi, Rolfi! Hi, everyone! (Bob whistles) Great gears! What a clock, Uncle Hans! I know it is not like my other clocks that have the wooden cuckoo birds popping out from the inside, but I just got back from a trip, and I saw a lot of clock towers, so I decided to make a tiny one just like them, - to hang on my wall. - (chiming) Wowee! What a chime! Say, speaking of clock towers, we're visiting a town that has a big one right now! I read in my travel book that its bells have beautiful chimes. Oh, how wonderful! I would sure love to hear the. Well, the clock's about to strike 12, which means the bells inside are gonna chime. - Actually, they're not. - Aah! A recent lightning storm broke the clock's parts, and we haven't been able to fix it yet, so... no chimes today. - Oh! - Hans: Oh! But I hope you'll still join our tour. There's a lot to check out here in my little town. At least that's some good news. Sorry, Uncle Hans. Guess we won't be hearing any chimes, after all. Oh, it's okay, Bob. Enjoy the tour. - Auf wiedersehen! - (phone beeps) While you're on the tour, your pets can enjoy our pet play area. Thanks. You three have fun in here - while I take the tour. - Okay. - We will! - Yeah! Bob: I sure wish Uncle Hans and I could hear that clock tower chime. (sighs) Poor Bob. He and Uncle Hans really wanted to hear that clock tower's bells chime. Rolly: Think they'd like my puppy chimes instead? - Bong! Bong! Bong! Bong! Bong! - (laughs) Maybe. Except they wanted to hear the clock tower bells chime. But the clock is broken. I sure wish someone would fix it, then. Wait! We can fix it! It'll be our mission. Now you're tick-talkin', brother! You pups have a blast with that clock. I'm just gonna... stay here and nap. We know. That's what we love about you, sister. Come on, Rolly. Let's go fix that clock. (barking) - Let's go! - Let's go! ♪ On your bark, get ready, got a lot to do ♪ ♪ It's gonna be an awesome adventure ♪ ♪ We're super-duper extra overly excited ♪ ♪ To be goin' on a mission, goin' on a mission ♪ Five, four, three, two, one! - (barking) - (whimsical music playing) (whirring) - (chiming) - Both: Let's go! ♪ Ba ba ba ba ba ba ♪ ♪ We're goin' on a mission, goin' on a mission ♪ Great gears! There are a lot of gears in here. Bingo: Since bells make this clock's chiming sounds, let's start by checking them. Now, I'm no bell expert, but these bells don't look broken. - (both sniffing) - Don't smell broken, either. Were you about to lick the bell to see if it tasted broken? Um, no. That's a silly idea. Why would I do that? - (chiming) - And these bells don't sound broken, either. Maybe the problem is that another part of the clock is broken. We could test its other parts, too. I'll see if I can make these gears move, and you check each one out. (grunting) Good gear, good gear, good gear... (speaking gibberish) Wow, that's really hard to say fast. Anyway, these gears are all still working. If the bells are good, and the gears are good, why isn't the clock working? If only we knew a clock expert. I bet they could tell us. Wait! I know where we can find clock experts! Uncle Hans' cuckoo clock workshop. - Bravo, Bingo! - (laughs) Thanks, brother. Now, let's jet over to Germany and get a look at one of those clocks. (whirring) - (thuds) - Oops! Sorry! [♪♪] All right. We're at Uncle Hans' cuckoo clock workshop. Let's knock, and... - Cuckoo! - (yells) I thought I heard a puppy dog. - Udo! Rolfi! - Udo! Rolfi! Cuckoo! Two! I heard two puppy dogs! - Bingo! Rolly! - Rolly: Hi! What brings you to the workshop? We have a clock problem and need your help. Come in! Come in! Tell me all about it! And Bob and Uncle Hans wanted to hear the bells chime. But the clock tower is broken! A broken clock tower? Say it ain't so. Say it ain't cuckoo so! (laughing) Oh, my goodness. That is a problem. Und Hans wanted to hear those beautiful bells chime, too. I, I simply can't stand the thought of a broken clock. I love clocks of all kinds. (chiming) [♪♪] ♪ Clocks ♪ ♪ I love clocks ♪ ♪ Nice and round, big or small ♪ ♪ On your wrist or on the wall ♪ ♪ I love to hear them go tick-tock ♪ ♪ Marking the seconds, minutes, hours, I love clocks ♪ - ♪ Yes, clocks ♪ - ♪ He loves clocks ♪ - ♪ I love clocks ♪ - ♪ He loves clocks ♪ ♪ They're the very bestest way to tell us all the time of day ♪ - ♪ Some chime ♪ - (chiming) - ♪ Some go cuckoo ♪ - All: Cuckoo, cuckoo! ♪ Und here's what those clocks are telling you ♪ ♪ They tell you when it's time for breakfast ♪ ♪ When it's time for lunch ♪ ♪ They tell you when you have an appointment coming ♪ ♪ So you needn't get your lederhosen in a bunch ♪ ♪ Ya ta ta ta ta ta ta ta, Clocks! ♪ ♪ I love clocks ♪ ♪ Nice and round, big or small ♪ ♪ On your wrist or on the wall ♪ ♪ I love to hear them go tick-tock ♪ (ticking) ♪ To mark the seconds, the minutes, the hours ♪ ♪ I love clocks ♪ - (chiming) - (dinging) (laughing) - Whew! - Okay, puppies. We have got to fix that clock tower! But how? We were hoping if you showed us how a clock works, maybe we'll be able to fix the clock tower. Ooh, and I've got just the clock we can use! Now, most clock towers are made a lot like this. They have gears and a pendulum. - Pendu-who? - A pendulum. Pen-du-lum. (laughs) That's fun to say. - Pen-du-lum. - Pen... Pendulum. (all laughing) The fun in saying it is matched only by its importance. When the pendulum swings, it makes the gears move, which makes the clock work. Uh-huh. But if the pendulum stops... The clock stops, too. Both: Ohhhhh! Except I don't remember seeing a pendulum swinging in the clock tower, so maybe it's missing. - (lightning crashes) - (gasps) The lightning storm! Remember, Bingo? The lightning storm broke the clock's parts. What if it blew the pendulum away? Then we might not have seen it, because it wasn't where it was supposed to be. I bet that's what happened! If we can find it, we can fix the clock. Then Bob and Uncle Hans will finally get to hear its bells chime. Thanks for your help, guys. Udo: It was our cuckoo pleasure! Any time! (laughs) Pun intended. Bingo: All right, Rolly. We need to find that missing pendulum, and fast. Since this clock is so big, the pendulum will probably be a lot bigger than the one Rolfi and Udo showed us. All right, puppy eye. Beep-boop-boop. Let's find that pesky pendulum. (panting) Nothing around here. Rolly: Ooh! Bingo, look! - Bingo: Is it the... - Both: Pendulum! We found it! We found the pendulum! Both: ♪ Puh, puh-puh-puh, puh, pendulum ♪ Let's hang it back where it belongs. (both grunting) Both: Whoa! Hold on, Rolly! I gotcha! I can almost reach it! Aah! No, I can't. (loud clanging) (clattering, clanging) Bow wow! We broke the clock tower even more! We can fix it, we can fix it, we can fix it. - (grunts) - (clanging) I don't know where these gears go. We've made everything so much worse. So much worse. - How are we gonna fix all these gears? - Gears... Great gears! (gasps) Rolly! Maybe we can't fix 'em, but I think I know who can. Oh, and grab a gear. We're gonna need it. Diggity-done! Both: Whoa! (grunting) Tour Guide: And that concludes our tour of the town. Suffering side orders of seaweed salad! It looks like the pet area door opened on accident. Oh! Thank goodness you two are still here. Hey, where'd you pups get those gears? Huh... I wonder if that lightning storm blew them out of the clock tower, and all the way over here. If they're from the clock tower... (popping) ...we should put them back. Come on. We'll be back to get you later, Hissy. Great broken gears! Ha! No wonder the clock tower isn't working. Look at all these broken gears! (echoing): Gears, gears, gears... - (gears squeaking) - (boinging) You know, I just might be able to fix this clock tower. (laughs, gasps) With a little help, of course. - Uncle Hans! - Hello, Bob! Ha ha! Uncle Hans (over phone): Not too tight, Bob. - Ha ha! - Ja, that's the right piec. Be careful, Bob. - You have built a robot! - Oh! - This is easy! - (groans) - (yelling) - (clanging) Whoa, whoa, whoa, oh! (groaning) There you go, Bob. That pendulum is the last piece! - (clanging) - (gears clicking) Look, Rolly! The clock is working! You did it, Bob! Great work! Oh, thanks, Uncle Hans. But I couldn't have done it without your help. (gasps) And if my watch is correct, we're just in time to hear some beautiful chimes. (ticking) And here come the chimes. - (loud chiming) - Aah! - Woo-hoo! Yay! - (all cheering) - (laughing) - All right! - Man: It's working! It's working! - (loud chiming) Cherished chimes! Ha ha! That sounds even more beautiful that I imagined. Ja, it sure does! Thank you for fixing our town's clock tower. - (chiming) - (Hissy shrieks) You're welcome. It was our pleasure. (Hissy sighs) Ha ha! I'm so happy Bob and his Uncle Hans finally got to hear the clock tower's bells chime. Me, too, Rolly. Mission accomplished. - (paws slap) - Bingo: Mm! And now, it's my time to chime. - Bong! Bong! Bong! - (Bingo laughing) - (both laughing) - Both: Bong! Bong! Bong! - Aah! - Both: Bong! Bong! Bong! (sighs) Well, if you can't beat 'em, - join 'em. - Aah! All: Bong! Bong! Bong! - (pups barking) - (Hissy meowing) (laughs) You crazy pets. (barking, meowing, laughing continues) [♪♪] Sync corrections by srjanapala
