 So... Christ, this is horrific. Yes, go on. Prosecutor, hello. Could you see her face? Nothing, she's been mutlitated. Her face has been smashed to a pulp. She must have been beautiful. So, no clothes, no distinguishing features. A ring on the left ring finger. Obviously no papers, nothing to identify her.

 She was probably killed last night, elsewhere, then moved here. I'll open an inquiry and you'll be in charge. Chief Inspector? Laure Berthaud. You will report to Judge Roban. Do you know him? She was killed because she was beautiful. Hence the ferocity. Do you think I can get a taxi here? No, but I'll get you a lift. New prosecutor. Nice, huh? SPIRAL Let me recap. I'm a bit lost. Your daughter, a nursery school pupil, accuses her teacher, Mrs Sauvanet, of hitting her with a broom whilst dressed as a witch?

 She didn't say a word. My wife had to worm it out of her. She's made no progress all year with this teacher. She used to love going to school. Suddenly, she doesn't want to go. She's wetting her bed again. She has nightmares. Alarm bells for parents. So, we drew up a petition, signed by twenty-four families who want her replaced. Children can tell lies but not twenty-four at once. We just want Mrs Sauvanet to be replaced, so our children aren't traumatised by a lunatic. This is a job for the Education Board. We saw the director. If she goes to prison, they will have to replace her. We just don't want her to go anywhere near our children. If that's the only way, so be it. The problem is removing the cloth without damaging what's underneath. Let's start by cutting here. We'll keep the knot intact for future analysis. It will be tough. It's stuck to her skin. It might give us a kind of transfer like the Shroud of Turin, but in relief form. What did they do that with? A hammer? My goodness! We may never know, but she must have been beautiful. That would explain the sheer ferocity. It's not really a matter of identification. Otherwise, they would have disfigured the hands too. If you look here on the tibia, we see what looks like an old fracture, knitted, as you can see, by the fitting of a huge plate. Let's try unscrewing that. This kind of plate hasn't been used for years now. I mean, in this country. It remained in use for longer in the former Communist countries. A Soviet technique from the Moscow Faculty of Medicine. It may help to identify her. The fracture was treated in an Eastern bloc country... before the fall of Communism, which would lead us to believe that the victim lived there... at least until her late teens. See? Cyrillic writing. Otherwise, we've not much to go on. But I'm fairly sure that most of the lesions to the face and skull were inflicted post-mortem. Not to kill or wound, but to destroy. It's very methodical in its execution. There are no signs of impulsive behaviour. Unfortunately, they've done a good job because this is of no help to us. Not feeling well, Inspector? What will the pathologist think? It's not your first autopsy. I couldn't deal with that. You know not to look at the face. There was no face. There was nothing left. No face left. And him blathering on... Your case won't hold up. It's appalling. That's why we chose you as our lawyer, Mr Escudi?. You risk a heavy sentence. I'm not just painting it black to make myself look better. You say it will be tough. Fair enough. Miss Karlsson, can you explain it to them? Your being found guilty makes no difference to us, neither in terms of fees, nor Mr Escudi?'s reputation. If I lose, it's your fault. If you win, it's thanks to me. It costs exactly the same. Plus the fine, if there is one. Do we risk a fine? You risk ending up behind bars, but you won't believe me. You lured the victim, tied him to a radiator, and slashed him with a carpet knife. You have to help us, Mr Escudi?. - It won't be easy. You must have some idea. I don't know... Perhaps plead stupidity. I conclude, Your Honour... that this was nothing other than pure torture, whose perpetrators ought to have been tried by civil jury. Though that is not the case, it must not be considered a cause for clemency. On the contrary, the sentence must be absolute and unwavering. I request that the defendants, who are both guilty, and equally so, between whom not the slightest difference prevails be sentenced to four years' imprisonment, and that each be fined 150,000 euros. Thank you, Your Honour. Mr Escudi?. Excuse me. Mr Prosecutor. Excuse me. I'm asking the judge to continue the hearing, if you agree. Why not? How is he? Escudi?? He's dead. Didn't you know? You're joking. - No. A heart attack. Yet you're pleading? Now he's dead, I'll win. I just need your agreement. Dead or not, you have no case. His last wishes. A dead man pleading against you. You have no chance of a conviction. Do you really think so? - I'll pretend to read his last plea. It's perfect. I wrote it myself. But I'll make it seem as if I can barely read it due to emotion. If my clients keep quiet, I'll get an acquittal. What a cynic. - So, you agree? Escudi? will be quickly forgotten. Any delay will spoil my show. If that's what you want. - I have a good case. You'll see. This plate is a real find. - It doesn't get us far. Only he can unearth such things. Can you file this please? We're totally in the dark. - A lot less so now. Yes. Come in. Have you met? - Yes, this morning. So silly of me! I thought you were in court against Escudi?? I wanted to see the duel. He died after my summing up. He died? In the middle of a hearing? Died like an actor! He just collapsed. My goodness. I won't be mourning him. So, regarding the faceless murder victim, there are still no leads. No witnesses, no one saw or heard anything, but she wasn't killed there. However, thanks to the autopsy, we have a clue as to her identity. A native of the Eastern bloc. Professor Marquant noticed an old fracture of the tibia. It was repaired Moscow-style. He has an eye for such things. The autopsy showed sexual violence, so an Eastern European prostitute. East European girls aren't all prostitutes. Not over there, perhaps, but over here, they often are. She has the profile - pretty, blonde, well proportioned, 1.70m, 55 kilos, well groomed, manicured, massacred, severely punished, the body left as a warning. A sordid case of prostitution. A job for the police. Is there nothing else that we can do? Informers and criminal records often get results. She was murdered. They must be brought to justice. We'll try, Mr Prosecutor. I left you a message. Did you get it? About the violent witch teacher? Inspector Fromentin mentioned it. I'm not convinced and the parents are pushy but with children, I don't take any chances. Fromentin has children too. He thinks it needs checking out. He can handle it. Mr Prosecutor, I have a good team, one you can trust. Why did you say that? I don't know. You don't know me. I know you, but only by reputation. Really? I have a reputation already? - A rather good one. My hearing is due to restart. There was no head? - No. They massacred the face. Yeah, you said it. Who would do such a thing? And dumped in a skip! Was she an Arab? - Polish or Romanian. We're not sure. Did you take her out of the skip? Me and a few others. That's so disgusting. Any ideas? - No. I don't know. You meet some pretty nasty people. Yeah, but there's been no talk of skips. Was she really a prostitute? - No, she was a nun! You're right. If she wasn't on the game, it's odd. Especially the mutilation stuff. Will you give me the low-down? - Today, it's on me. But I'll take your dough, anyway. Do you know that I've been snorting coke all morning? It's really good. You should try it. - Maybe I have. I don't believe it. The coke-snorting policeman! Have you really tried it? Really? Here. I'll give you a bit. I have kilos of it. Well, maybe not kilos... You keep that. If you give it back, I'll denounce you for possession and use. OK, but I'll give it back intact next time. It's not normal. Usually, it's the police who give dope to junkies. It's sad about that poor girl in the skip. I'll keep my ears open, I promise. It's so sad. Let me know if the coke is any good. If it is, I'll finish it. Good work, when I least expected it. I prepared my case well. It meant a lot to Mr Escudi?. He had designs on the client's wife. I may appeal, you know. What they did was vile. On appeal they'll be convicted, but it's all the same to me. Mr Prosecutor... PETITION To replace Mrs Sauvanet I don't dress up. It's a puppet. The puppet is a witch. It represents a witch. It's not the same thing. Can children tell the difference? It's a puppet of a nice witch. - But a witch all the same. It's a pedagogic tool designed to link ideas that are separate to the curriculum. She frightens them. No. They have great fun with her. Listen, I've received complaints. I have a petition. I know. I'm accused of beating the children. Have you ever hit them? Have you ever hit a pupil? Their parents hit them. And Farandole the witch? - Then, they say it's me. Seems too easy, don't you think? I'd like to be a witch. Sorry? I'm not the witch. I try to do my job as best I can with children who have changed a lot since I began. It's like the other teachers told me, children are no longer the same. Are you having trouble with your pupils? Yes. It isn't easy. Especially the parents. Are they hard to handle? If I were the witch... I wouldn't bother the children. Witches like children. What about Farandole? She's only a puppet. But you can't imagine what some parents have made of her. It's not her fault. She's just a puppet. Do you understand? So, you totally repudiate the accusations against you? I'm not a witch... Because witches like children? Why do you say that witches like children? Witches are wicked. Would you agree to see a doctor for an appraisal? Do you mean a psychiatrist? - Yes. I already have. I was even hospitalised. I broke down, due to the parents, and was hospitalised. And after, it continued. What continued? You. You continue. I've checked the missing persons list. None of the girls match the victim. And girls from the East in general? - It boils down to her. She's pretty, but too young, too small, too brunette... Where's she from? - Romania. Sofia Andrescu. Her parents have had no news for a week. She came to stay with her sister Elina, who, as far as I know, is a student. She was the one who reported her missing. So, how about your girlfriend? Not my girlfriend, my informer. But I do have a soft spot for her. Has she heard anything? - Not a word. Neither her, nor anyone else. The tomb of the unknown prostitute. Well, I'll be off. I have parents to question. A special treat. Are you OK? - Yes. Why? - You're behaving strangely. She's pretty. Yeah, maybe she knows some other Romanians. Is this the right door? - Second floor on the right. There's no point in knocking. No one's in. Chief Inspector Laure Berthaud, Crime Squad. Have you any news on Elina's sister? Did you know her? - She lived here. She was on holiday, then we thought she was in Romania, and not a word since. Did Miss Andrescu tell you? Yes, we talk a lot. She was very worried. She borrows my classic novels. A foreigner who decided to read all of Balzac. But she does speak perfect French. Does she study literature? - No. Balzac is just for pleasure. And she's no longer really a student. She's due to take her PhD in biology. She found a job in a lab that makes medicines, through the professor who is supervising her thesis. A brilliant girl, and very pretty. The photo of her sister isn't bad either. They're not at all alike. Sofia is pretty, but Elina is a real beauty. 1.75m. 60 kilos? When did you last see her? Two days ago... No. Three days ago. She's often away for days at a time. Let me think. Today is Wednesday. She ought to be home soon. She teaches on Wednesday afternoons. She always comes by to pick up her stuff. Thank you, Madam. Well? - Something's not right. I'd like to check it out. Apparently, she'll be back soon. You wait for her and you drive me. - OK, boss. Brief me on the parents. I pity their kids. I hope I'm not like that. You're worse. - And you're an idiot. Call when you see her. The neighbour says Elina Andrescu is a real beauty. I'll let you know. But was your child specifically a victim of the teacher? Yes, Madam. Personally and specifically. No, what she did to others is for them to say. I want to know what he says, not what his friends told him. What I would like you to do is ask him nicely this evening and try to make sense of what he says. I'll call back tomorrow. Goodbye. - Have you finished? No. - Andrescu's flat was searched. Did Gilou call? - No. The neighbour called me. Bloody hell. Andrescu's apartment was searched. Did you see anyone leave? There was a tall man with a big bag, but I'm not sure he came from there. What did he look like? - I didn't really see. Good work, Gilou. I was asked to look out for a girl. Great! Laure will love that. You stay put. "You stay put!" What a nerve! What's his problem? I thought she was home. The door was ajar. I called out. No answer. So, I looked in. When I saw the mess, I smelt a rat. She's so tidy. - Have you been in? No, I didn't dare, in case of fingerprints. No, I was scared, so I called you. Let's go in. Do you think there's someone there? - Better safe than sorry. Like she says, there may be prints. There's no one here. Look at this - a keyboard, a screen, but no computer. They came to clean, not to burgle. Gilou saw a man come out with a big bag. Did he get a description? - The guy was too far away. He wasn't sure he came from here. - Great. It's pretty big for a student. - Yes, but a PhD student. Didn't you use to work with Mr Escudi?? Marcelline Monteil, I'm a lawyer. You pleaded in his place just after he died. News travels fast. I had already heard of you. Are they keeping you on? No. I only worked with him. Come and see me at my office. When? - When you like. Tonight or tomorrow. Just call before you come. I'll warn my secretary. - Fine. You're early. - OK? Are you OK, Benoit? Been waiting long? No. I wanted to hear you plead, but I was late. Sitting room, dining room. Fireplace. One bedroom here and another opposite. The kitchen and a bathroom down the hall. It's big, but aren't you OK where you are? It's not for me. It's for you, your new apartment. It's not on. So, where do you intend to live? In hotels? I no longer live anywhere. Are you waiting for your darling wife to take you back? Is that what you want? Stop lecturing me. - I'm not. You're cleverer and wiser than me. - That's true. But camping on her doorstep won't make Marianne take you back. Nor will mutual recriminations. You both need a breather. Here you have all you need. Look - a kitchen, a table, chairs, sitting room, dining room, bedroom... I left some condoms in the bedside locker. We'll furnish it more if you decide to stay. I can't accept it. Pierre, not only do I earn a lot, but this place costs me nothing. I rented it for an Italian customer of mine. Our deal was postponed, so you're doing me a favour. Then I'll pay you rent. - It's too tricky for the accounts. We'll think about that later if you stay on. Keep your hotel for tonight, but tomorrow you move in here. Come on. Let's go and eat. Then, I'm playing poker. Are you coming? Not if the others are as rich as you. Just low stakes. If I recall, you were good at poker. Has eight years of marriage made you forget? You'll fleece the lot of us. I don't want Marianne to leave me. Pierre, let's eat. This morning, I saw a corpse. I felt like that was my marriage. It's stupid, I know. - Yes, it really is. Your marriage has life in it yet. So, we're sure it's her? Yes, no need for DNA. Her X-rays match up Regarding the plate, Chief Inspector Berthaud is usually efficient but she's surpassed herself, and not just to please me, Mr Prosecutor. The inquiry confirms what the neighbour said. She was finishing her thesis, and had just found a job. So, she could afford her rent. She's not been working long. Her expensive lifestyle began when she was a student with a meagre scholarship, and the odd lesson. So she was living beyond her means? - Yes, with a very busy bank account. We don't know who she really was. She was obviously hiding something. We don't even know her mobile number. So she led a double life? - Probably. Going to her place was a good idea. Police are like that. They have a sixth sense. The photo's wonderful. - We'll use it. We'll publish it and appeal for witnesses. Her sister's photo too? We had better be careful. Appeals for witnesses can get out of hand. What's the sister's name? - Sofia. She's a missing teenager who vanished before Elina's death and she may have run away with some boy. So, you were monitoring little Priscilla Vernet? I used to see her. I'm the school psychologist. I mainly look after nursery and early primary school children. So, why were you seeing her? I was working on reading acquisition. She's quite advanced. Didn't you notice anything unusual? No telltale signs? No, nothing unusual. And the bruises on her legs? Her parents sent a medical certificate. I'd love to know the doctor's name. Madam... are you trying to cover up for the teacher? There's nothing to cover up. I've known Mrs Sauvanet for a long time. She's beyond reproach. But she's a bit fragile, isn't she? Priscilla's sister beats her. She's from her father's first marriage. The parents refuse to admit it. They would accuse all and sundry, rather than face up to it. It's good wine. - Isn't it? Did you see the photo? What photo? - This one. She was the corpse I saw. You know, the one that I told you about? I didn't know what she looked like. How come? - Her murderers disfigured her. No, worse still, they ripped her face off. She's beautiful, isn't she? - She was beautiful. I'm sorry, but I can't see you in my office. I'm in a meeting. Thanks for coming. - I don't know why I'm here. My research tells me you specialise in employment law. Not just employment law. - Almost exclusively... I'm a criminal lawyer. Employment law just isn't my thing. I know you're a criminal lawyer. You worked with Escudi?. That's why I wanted to see you. For the criminal aspects of employment law? To imprison shady bosses and lock up unionists? It's all the same to me. No, I don't need you for that. Have you heard of my brother? He needs someone. It may be you. He's a lawyer, but he can't plead now. Is his name Monteil? - No, Vincent Leroy. He's my half-brother. Does he do criminal law? With him, that's all you would do. Listen, have a think about it. It's a very serious proposition. Very well. I'll think about it. See? No progress. Well? She seems good, but I'm not sure it will work. And physically? Pretty... Very pretty. Yes, it's for a detention report. 24 hours. I'll put you through. Come in. Please have a seat. So... It's your daughter who beats Priscilla, not Mrs Sauvanet. You have no right. - No right to what? To wrongly accuse? And you do? Listen, the girls fight. It's only normal. It's not easy. But a lot of Priscilla's bruises weren't caused by Jenny. The teacher didn't hurt your daughter or anyone else. You're all protecting her. Shall we talk about your petition? You used people who didn't sign. Not true. - They refused to sign. Some people are just irresponsible. Luckily, you're here to help. If they file a complaint, I'll prosecute you. What about the children? You don't care if they're beaten. You're just protecting your fellow civil servants. Please leave. And what about my daughter's therapy? Now! Or I'll have you arrested. About the girl in the paper... Do you know her? - No, but I saw her. I'm a taxi driver, and she rode in my taxi. When was it? - Tuesday evening. The night she was killed. I picked her up in the west and dropped her off at her home. How did you know it was her house? Did she tell you? I looked in her diary. She left it in the car. I thought I could return it to her. She was so pretty, you know? The address matched the drop-off, but in the end, there was no need. Have you got the diary? What was the pick-up address? - It was an order by phone. I asked the network to source it, but it will take them a while. It's not easy to find. - The sooner the better. The inspector will see you out and organise the follow-up. Thank you for your trouble. If she did leave it in the taxi, her killers didn't touch it. If I want your advice, I'll ask for it. If we solve this, it won't be thanks to you. It beats me how you missed that man on a deserted street. OK, you can go. Unbelievable. A diary. Can you believe it? - Yes! The victim loses her diary before being murdered. It's a stroke of luck. Have you looked at it? - I wanted you to see it first. There are names you wouldn't believe. Names that are quite familiar. People who you know? People known to everyone. This will be fun. She was trying to get into the museum without paying. The guards prevented her and there was a struggle. Among her things, we found a summons from you. Yes, that's from me. That's why we called you. She refuses to talk. We didn't think you would come. - I was nearby. The ambulance should be here soon. When you summoned her, did she show up? Excuse me, Mr Prosecutor. Uncuff her, please. She's calm now but before... Do it, please. If you need me, I'm just next door. Remember me? Pierre Cl?ment. I'm standing in for the State Prosecutor. We met in my office. Remember? Concerning the Priscilla Vernet complaint? Priscilla's bruises were from her big sister. The inquiry is over. I told the parents what I thought of them. Everything is in order. You can file a complaint, if you like. Even if you don't, I can prosecute them, if you agree. You don't have to decide right now. You probably need a rest. Think about it. Are you leaving? I came to see you. Yes, I'm off with my travel bag. There's nothing suspect in it? Just my wife cut into pieces. I was staying in a hotel and I found an apartment. Did you hear about the diary? Judge Roban must be happy. - He's delighted. There are key names in it. All we need now is the pick-up address. It's just a matter of hours. - Good. Is that all? All what? I don't know. It's rare to progress so fast. I thought you would be happy. Did you hear about the teacher? - Yes, the parents made it all up. She's in a psychiatric hospital. I pushed her and she snapped, but not how I thought she would. It's not your fault. I wanted to be sure. Even if the parents were wrong, I wanted to show we cared, that we were listening, protecting their kids. That was the right thing to do. You're not to blame for people's stupidity. I pushed too hard. She was already pretty ill. Are you OK? Would you like to go for a drink? No, I can't, but it was nice of you to ask. Bye. Hi, this is Marianne Cl?ment. Please leave a message. Come on, Pierrot. Hang in there. Use your arms. Breathe. Well done! It's hot, isn't it? - How do you feel? That's it! That's it! Hold on. - What? I knew it! Chief Inspector, how are you? Sorry, I didn't hear that. You have the phone number and the pick-up address. Hold on a minute... Do you have a pen? Bloody hell. Hold on. Go ahead. Forty-seven... Rue Adolphe Yvon... And the phone number? OK, I'll call you back. Thanks. Why did you ask me to write down my own address? Elina Andrescu called from there before she died. Remember? The photo in the paper? Didn't it look like her? Didn't you recognise her? She took a taxi from your building. Guess where she called it from. Your bloody telephone! No, I called the taxi. Do I call the police or smash your face in? Yeah, I knew Elina.
