 Let me out! - Shut up, motherfucker! Aziz! No, Aziz! Help! Let me out! Let me out, Aziz! I beg you! Let me out, please. Aziz, l'II pay you back! I swear I will! Let me out, Aziz! A barbecue. - He was alive? Of course, that's what makes it fun. Just like last year. No witnesses, no clues, unsolved case.

 Will you request an autopsy, Inspector? I already have, sir. Tall male, lying on his side in the foetal position, hands tied behind his back with... wire. Clothes incinerated... Shoes... No more shoes. The head being near the petrol tank, all facial features have disappeared, making positive identification impossible. We found this. That's excellent. I like that. What do you think this is? No idea.

 I bet you anything it's a lighter. A gold-plated lighter. The same as we found last year. Could it be the same person? Someone who doesn't care if we know. A barbecue is all about spectacle. Fingerprints? Plenty. But the fire brigade came first so... Any clues? - None. No ballistic evidence. Fake number plates. The engine number will identify the owner. But as the car was probably stolen that won't tell us much. Have you asked around? - I've sent a team. Hi, kid. Your parents here? You are? Lieutenant Fromentin. Police. A car was torched here last night. Did you see anything? Nothing. Very well. Thank you. Goodbye. Once we've examined the body, we remove it from the vehicle. Gilou, you grab the legs, Steph, the torso, and I'II grab the head. Not up to it? We'll manage without you. Hurry up, then. We've got work to do. Careful... Come on... Ready, Steph? One, two, three... Shit! Okay, Gilou, you handle the rest. In our culture, is custom man hit woman. Iron was accident. Usually use belt. I wouldn't tell the judge it's a Croatian custom to hit your wife with an iron bar. What do I tell him? Shall I pay him? How much? 1000, 2000, 3000 euros? Mr Vladic, I'll let you think it over. See you when the case resumes. You prefer dollars or euros? I can give the judge plenty of money. I have lots of money. I can give the judge lots of money... Let go of me! How is today's judge on domestic violence? Very cool. I mean towards men. Here are your divorce papers. Just date and sign. Thanks. I pulverised your wife. - That wasn't necessary. You should ask for compensation. For? - Damage to your career. I was promoted to Deputy Prosecutor. I can't complain. Afraid of losing your gentlemanly reputation by demanding money from your wife? I just want to put it all behind me. Isn't that what you did? When you worked for that minister who treated you like shit, you resigned and started from scratch. Yes, it wasn't a great success. I'm sure you'll climb back up. And do you have something to climb? While you're moving on, I'm still paying the bill. Which reminds me that I haven't paid you. I advise you to avoid him. He's bad news. Did I ask for your advice? Hurry up. In the girls'? - It's all right. Sure you want to do it? Is it your first time? - Yes. Sure you want to do it? - Yes! Know how to do it? - Sure. It stings. - That's normal. Forget it. Are you all right? Marie? What's wrong, Marie? Talk to me! Shit! Marie! It happened at the school? - In the toilets, sir. She's a minor, I suppose? - Yes, 15. What's her condition? - We don't know yet. Okay, proceed as usual. I'll call later. Miss... Money for judge. 2000, right? Yes... That's fine. Thanks, Miss. Well, goodbye then, Mr Vladic. Goodbye. And be more careful. Where were you? We've been waiting an hour. Sorry. Is something funny? - No, not at all. At least it's a lead. What's his name? Morales. Can I help you? We're investigating number plates traced to you and found on a stolen car. I change dozens of number plates a year. I can't tell you which one goes on what car. This one had a man in the boot. What people do with their cars is their business. What do you want? We're busy, we've nothing to tell you. Can you tell us who asked you to change these plates? BMW, 5 Series. Not your average car... So? What are you accusing us of? Your papers, please. If you want to ask questions, ask me. Are you the boss? - No, my father is. Mr Morales... we'll search your workshop. Don't let them, Dad! You search the ground floor, I'll do the first floor. Calm down. This is an outrage! We'll complain to the UN. Back off! What are you doing? Don't touch it. Get out of it. You're really pushing it. It's hotting up! Arsehole. Don't move! Fuckers! I'll kill you. Let him go! Shut the fuck up! Calm down! Arrest this jerk for assaulting a police officer. Sit down! What the hell is this? Put that down! Talk to Mr Dussart. He's in the kitchen. Put it back. What's going on? Miss Karlsson? I'm Mr Dussart, bailiff. A bailiff for being one week behind with the rent? That's the law. By virtue of the powers conferred upon me... All right, I'll pay! How much do you want? Here, take it. Don't you have anything better to do? Now beat it. Don't take it personally, I'm just doing my job. Call that a job? You loser! Scram, all of you. Get out of my place! Beat it! "With a warrant to conduct a search of the Morales garage..." And then? - Then you describe what happened. Write that we didn't find anything. And the telescopic truncheon? She shouldn't carry one. It we mention it, the shit will hit the fan. Give me the magistrate on duty. It's Police Inspector Berthaud. Laure, are you going to Casualty? Because I was slapped? It would be better. So what do I write? - Ask Gilou. You write that the inspector was assaulted and defended herself, her assailant fell down a few steps and Lieutenants Fromentin and Escoffier used the minimum force necessary to restrain him. Any progress on the barbecue? Yes, the car was stolen six months ago in a car-jacking on Avenue Foch. It wasn't the owner in the boot. We spoke to him. So we're waiting tor the autopsy and DNA report... Any mishaps I need to know about? All's well, boss. Calling the Prosecutor's Office? - Trying. It your assailant appears in court, I want you there. Sorry, but I'm too busy with the barbecue. I insist. Let's go. What are you doing? Didn't you want to see him sing? Hurry! Okay? You here? - For you. Okay, kid? Where were you? - Where was I? The cops are after us. They searched the garage, they busted Kevin. Kevin's a dumb-arse. The cops can keep him for life, for all I care. Here. Go spend it, have some fun. Come and have a look, sir. Do you recognise this part? After 35 years in the business, I can recognise a petrol tank. Look carefully, Mr Morales. It appears the tank was divided into two parts using this metal piece. You can see where it was welded. Now that you mention it, yes, it's nicely done. Would it by any chance be your work? Me? Why would I do that? Perhaps for a client who wanted to smuggle drugs? This type of tank has two uses... Smuggling drugs or money. No, sir, I don't have such clients. I have no reason to do that. So if someone claims you have modified the tank, he is lying? Who says that? I have my sources, sir. The girl is out of her coma. We're waiting to see her. Did you talk to the principal? Yes, he's pretending to be shocked. No drugs in his elite school. But the girl's best friend told me a Year 12 boy is the school pusher. His name is Adrien. She doesn't know his surname but he's super cute. Sorry, I've got to go. Please come with me. How old are you? Two and a half? Show some interest. - Okay. I'm sorry. Mrs Belmont? - Yes. Lieutenant Escoffier. We've come to see Marie. My colleague will sit here to type the report. Can we talk? - Of course. Did you know Marie did drugs? Not at all. Otherwise I would have... I don't know... taken her to a psychologist or had her change schools. You hadn't noticed any changes? New friends, older boys... Me? I live in a bubble. I see nothing, hear nothing. What kind of mother am I, in your opinion? A total idiot or just irresponsible? Excuse me. Hello, Marie. I'd like to know who gave you the heroin. She can't hear you. I spoke to your best friend. She told me you have a boyfriend. And you meet every evening to smoke joints. Adrien? Does that ring a bell? Exhibitionism I admit to. I was naked under my coat. But no way did I hold up traffic. Flashing my tits won't stop the traffic. Let go of me, motherfuckers! You're hurting me. Let go of me, motherfuckers! I have the right to a lawyer! Frankly... - Excuse me. Hello, my name is Karlsson... - What do you want? You a lawyer? And human rights expert. Nice to meet you, Mrs... - Karlsson. I'm Mr Morales. Excuse me... Szabo! Good morning, brother. How's tricks? - Sorry, I'm due in court in 30 minutes. Come on, relax. Take time to enjoy life. I registered your music label and did the paperwork to open an account. I can talk to the bank but I need money. You want money? Here's money. See you later, buddy. Aziz... It you start a new label you must sign up other artists. Your CDs alone can't explain all the profits. The cops aren't dumb. The cops? Hear them talking on the radio about the guy who got toasted in a car? So? The cops can't even find the guy who did it. They can't do anything. They're rotten, they stink. Relax, brother. I'm not your brother. I handle your finances and that's where it ends. Sorry, but I have to go. Listen to this. My new CD. It'll change you. Your Honour, Inspector Berthaud omits many things, like the tact that she hit my client with a truncheon. Your Honour, Mr Morales slapped me. Silence or l'll clear the court. Resume. Inspector, you say you were hit. All right. But can you show us a medical certificate? No. Order. Then you'll forgive me for having some doubts. As for my client, Your Honour, I found him in his cell in great pain. But no one had deemed it necessary to have him examined by a doctor. Your Honour, the detainee never said he was in pain. Inspector, I can cite a dozen people who heard my client plead for medical attention. Order! Your Honour, this case is not ready to be judged. This was a veritable beating. I shall provide proof in due time. My client was knocked to the ground, terrorised... Under threat, he signed whatever he was given without even reading it, with only one thing in mind... to escape from his tormentors. Enough! Order! Your Honour, I shall lodge a complaint against the prosecution in this case. Therefore I ask you to defer any further proceedings. Miss Karlsson... Karine Fontane from Le Monde. Delighted. Congratulations. You are remarkably pugnacious. Thanks. I can't help it, I don't like cops. Are you shocked, dear colleague? Do you work with Mr Szabo? - No, I don't have that honour. I know you sometimes recruit young assistants. Not at the moment. Why don't you try me? You don't beat about the bush. At least I tried. So you're a journalist? Yes, as I told you. I write a column. At the moment I'm writing a series on the legal system. The big shots, but also less prominent players. Well, you've knocked on the right door. See you soon. See you soon. That's him, all right. They're chewing the fat... Blah, blah, blah... Not many blacks at this school. Another one's coming. Keep shooting. Okay... I got him. He's going to give him... He's giving it to him. Okay, let's go. Inspector Berthaud, meet Karine Fontane from Le Monde. Hello. I was at the hearing. - Excuse me. It was tough. What was tough? Nothing. I'm sorry. Try to do an honest job for once and give us less crap in the papers. Excuse me. What's the matter? Jos?phine Karlsson is accusing me of assaulting a punk I had to arrest. Why is she doing that? Because cop-bashing is trendy and lucrative. I've got to go. Call me tonight, I'll see what I can do. He's in very bad shape. lt'll take some time. Sorry, Doc, but it's our only lead. You won't get any results today. Tomorrow... Inch' Allah. He's too busy to handle our stiff. Relax. Hello, we're the police. Are Mr and Mrs Marsac home? Relax, it's not the end of the world. What are you doing? Give that to me! You go and sit over there. What's up? Is he giving you trouble? It's okay. Know what? I'm sick of having our hands tied. If it were up to me... Thanks, but I don't need Adrien's parents on my back too. You know the dope is here. Start with the lounge room. Check the sofa and the floorboards. Give me the cutter. Nothing in there... Keep away. The fireplace... Give me your torch... Nice stash. The prosecutor will be delighted! Well? Did you forget it was there? Let's go. Thanks. Sorry for the mess. Come in. Your Honour... Madam... Kevin, this is Judge Wagner who will investigate your complaint. Kevin... You have nothing to fear. All we say is strictly confidential. No one will know about it. No one can threaten you. Understand? Good... Take a seat, Mr Morales. Forgive my client, Your Honour. He's a simple soul, deeply traumatised by the violence he was subjected to. He's implicated in a murder case. Stolen number plates were fitted in his father's garage. You can appreciate the flimsiness of the case. Are you all right? If you're in pain, don't hesitate to say so. We can resume later. - I'm fine. Sure? - Yes. Mr Morales, tell me exactly what happened. I want to call my father. You can't keep me here. You're 18. We can keep you as long as we want. Strip. - Standard procedure. Strip! Or shall I do it for you? No watch, no laces, no belt, no jewellery. You'll get them back when you're released. Take off your belt. Now! Socks. Underpants. You're joking. - Does it look like it? Shall I do it? Who supplies the dope? Wait till my father learns how you treated me. Lock him up. Pierre... - Sir. Allow me to introduce an old friend, Mr Vidal. I've heard a lot about you, sir. - Me too, me too. Mr Vidal is Mr Marsac's lawyer, The father of the boy arrested on dubious drug charges. Not at all dubious. He was dealing drugs in his school. Come now, why would young Marsac deal drugs? He doesn't need the money. Then why were 100 bars of cannabis and 50 grams of heroin found in his parents' apartment? I'm afraid I must agree with him. If Adrien was stupid enough to break the law, he should bear the consequences. No, I only ask you to guarantee his safety. After all, he's only 18, no previous record. I'll have him put in solitary confinement. Good, I appreciate your common sense and efficiency. My pleasure. While I think of it, would you like to discuss drugs in schools with Robert Br?an tonight at my place? The Justice Minister's private secretary? Sorry, old boy. You know Germaine. She hates more than six for dinner. Yes, I know Germaine. Tonight at my place, 8 p.m. sharp. I'm counting on you for young Marsac. Have him released before tonight. Just call his father. He'll send the driver. Everyone here is treated correctly, including Adrien Marsac. He's a special case. Don't rough him up. What shall we do? Play football with him? I won't extend his custody. Is that clear? What are you saying? This isn't you? Of course it's you! Look at that dumb haircut. We saw you dealing outside your school. Who's he? - I don't know. Who is he? It's not you? You don't know? Okay, you're dumb but you can read, right? What's this? Your schoolmates' statements. They all agree you're the dealer. So stop shitting us. Marie Belmont is dead. It's not true. I don't believe you. Is it Marie? It's my sister. I killed her for the photo. You'll be charged with murder. The prosecutor's due to call. Shall I translate? With a good lawyer you'll get ten years. Understand? Your dad won't save your arse. I didn't do anything. - You sold the heroin that killed her. Okay, I deal a bit, but Rachid supplies the drugs. Now you're talking. That wasn't so hard. We have three drug cases like Adrien Marsac's in three Paris high schools, four with Brancion. Lyc?e Voltaire, Lyc?es Daumesnil and Courteline. I doubt Marsac has ever set foot in the 20th arrondissement. That doesn't matter. A drug gang is targeting schools within a relatively limited area, except for Brancion, the only school outside this perimeter. But there must be some connection. There's your connection. On the Champs-Elys?es. A night club frequented by rich kids and Adrien Marsac's supplier, Rachid. I have his statement. At first Marsac only bought hash from him. Then Rachid offered him cheap heroin to get the kids hooked. To put an end to it, we must arrest Rachid. You want to set him up? Tonight, before he learns of Adrien's arrest. You're here, Inspector? Did she tell you I won't extend Marsac's custody? This is no longer relevant. He's just confessed. We're setting up his supplier. What do you mean? You weren't available, so she told the prosecutor on duty. Tell Adrien's lawyer that if he cooperates with the police, instead of a committal order, l'll place him under judicial control. We don't have much choice. Stop by my office when you're done. You made a fool of me. If we released Adrien, he would warn Rachid. Then what? You could have told me. Why did you go to the other prosecutor? Because sometimes you don't get it. - And you always do? Glad you noticed. I'm not in the mood for jokes. You're becoming paranoid and trust no one. Don't confuse your cop issues with your women's issues. I came to make peace, but it's not working. I'm sorry. Nice shirt. Work-related dinner. Very formal. Pity. You should fuck more often. It would do you good. Two versions of your statement which go in your file. In one you're a user-sharer, in the other a dealer. You can either go home or to the slammer. Here's your mobile. Call Rachid and arrange to meet him tonight. Talk to him as usual. Yes. Rachid? Champagne? - Yes, please. Ah, Pierre! I mentioned Robert Br?an, the private secretary at the ministry. I hear you work with that dinosaur, Prosecutor Machard? A complete moron! Stop it, Robert! You'll embarrass our guest. Robert always speaks his mind. Correction. I rarely do. If I did, I'd be dead. Assassinated! No, thanks, I don't smoke. I knew it. Seriously, do you enjoy what you do? Yes, it's fascinating. Strange. It's usually seen as a dead end. Young acting chief prosecutors like you are sacrificed to prop up prosecutors they can't get rid of. True, the hierarchy can be difficult and frustrating, like anywhere else. If you have any sense, leave. Rejoin the living before it's too late. Rachid, meet my friend Marco. After something? North African, 175 cm, black jacket, white shirt, black trousers... It's for the clients of the Morocco, a sauna. I do a bit of eckies and poppers. But like in love, you need variety. What would 50 grams cost me? Can you afford 50 grams? Okay, let's go. Where are we going? Can't we do it here? Do you mind going out? No, it's just that it wasn't in the plan. If you want the dope, follow me. If not, thanks for the drink. Wait! No problem, if you want to go out, we go out. Can I take a leak first? Watch out, they're leaving. Got it. Okay, hurry up. - Don't worry. If he's a cop, you're dead. Why did you agree? I had no choice. The guy's very suspicious. What's your gut feeling? He's got the drugs, I'm sure. He wants to know l'm alone. Don't worry, we won't go far. We'll nail the fucker. "We'll nail the fucker." What a jerk! A proper poofter's car! Rubbish! It's great for city driving. Why do you think I want to do business? Back off, I'm driving. May I know where we're going? Where are we going? - Want your dope or not? Careful with the car. You'll damage it. I don't care, I'm driving. Can't you drive normally? One-way street! Don't go! He's taken a one-way street. Don't follow. Okay, we're turning left. I'm loaded. Where is he? You're stressing out. - Fuck off. At least we have audio contact. What's this? You've left your mobile on? Are you a cop? Why stop? - What's this? Give me your mobile. - Why? Give me your fucking mobile! - Are you nuts? Shit! We've lost contact.
