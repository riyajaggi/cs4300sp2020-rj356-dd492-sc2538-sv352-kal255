 Previously... Justice must be done. We'll do everything. It's unbelievable. The victim loses her diary before getting killed. Faye has nothing to do with this. Do you recognise this? I need to know who's in the diary or I'm done for. I'm taking risks to protect you. That's her. That's the nanny. Something terrible has happened to your baby. The child ruined her life.

 You mean the baby was too much for her? The mother appears guilty. - What am I guilty of? - I'm your lawyer. If I knew more, I could defend better. The judge has the diary. Not any more. - What happened? - We had to take it. You appear in the victim's diary. Interesting. What bothers me is that he has got to me through you. I should be worried. Your friend Benoit knows a lot and you're going to get him to tell us what he knows. Judge Roban had Elina's diary stolen from him.

 Did you come to give me the good news? He knows I told you. I was the only one who knew he had it. He could ruin my career. And his own. He had it stolen. He just wants to expose well-known people to the press. Let's talk about him. Why did you do it? - The diary had to disappear. - Why? The names mentioned have nothing to do with Elina's death. I want to find Elina's murderers as much as you do. Before she died, I saw her as just a good friend. I was mistaken, otherwise I wouldn't be as unhappy as I am now. We're in position. Let's go. Against the wall. Meat trafficking. SPIRAL May I? Inspector Francis Joinot found the body. I saw the notice about the young girl. I thought it must be her. We found her sister in a skip. It's her, Sofia Andrescu. Some people thought she had run away. Do we know anything about these fridges? The children know nothing. All we can do is assess the place. But even if we're lucky, I can't guarantee anything. Corpse traffickers aren't soft. - They won't dare to speak. - Try anyway. Well? She lost blood from her wrist. - And was hung after death. - Date of death? Impossible to say. We don't know when they put her in the fridge. Could be three days or three weeks. Thank you. 08... 68. OK. Will you phone? Promise? I can do what I want. She was hung on a hook. Hi, Francis. The veins in each wrist... - Are you enjoying yourself? - Are you jealous? No. This isn't the place. They found Elina's sister's body in the fridge. She had a sister? Don't take me for a bloody idiot. You're using crude words already. Cut the sweet talk. You know more than the police. It's costing you a lot in powder. You haven't forgotten your police duties. It's me who asks the questions. - Not the other way round. - Go on. - More. - You're good at doing business. - You have two daughters. - What do you want with them? - How old are they? - What am I doing here? Answer me. How old are they? Thirteen and nineteen. Why? - Any problems with them? - What sort of problems? The young one is well-behaved. The other one is going to be a nun. She gets nervous when you talk to her. What do you want from them? You're accused of rape. - Sit back down. - Why? To listen to rubbish? No thanks. Sit back down, or we'll have to get nasty. - Does it make him laugh? - Gilou, please. Is that it? One accuses me of rape and the other is a junkie. - Who's a junkie? - Calm down. Gilou, that's enough. Get out of here. Stop it. Leave. We'll call you back. - Happy? - He was saying I'm a junkie. That's not the issue. The fact is he's right, because you are a junkie. All right. Easy. What? Do you want to hit me? Go on, then! The body is in quite good condition. There are quite deep strain marks on the ankles and wrists that appeared before the haemorrhage. This suggests the victim was tied up, mostly likely for violent sexual acts. This is confirmed by the state of the nipples, where there are lesions caused by torsions or bites. Examination of the vagina suggests the use of foreign bodies substantiated by the lesions caused by their penetration. The sphincter's damaged. Anal penetrations by various objects causing an internal haemorrhage. - Was it the cause of death? - The cause of death is the wrists. To die from an anal haemorrhage, there would have to be... It's more romantic than that. She cut open her veins and bled, presumably in a bath. Someone else could have cut her veins. No. Look. Do you see the cuts on the fingers? It's from the razor blade which she used. She did it herself. - We found something in her coat. - I thought the pockets were empty. One had a hole in it. A bank card receipt was in it. It's illegible for now. It was damp. That's a shame. We could have found out where she did her shopping. I'm getting divorced. Don't worry. It's nothing to do with you. That's not what I was thinking. What happened? - Nothing. - What do you mean? She's found someone else. - So have you. - It's not the same thing with us. Yeah, of course. It's no big deal. - No, but you know what I mean. - Yes. I'm talking rubbish, anyway. What would you do? I don't know, but he's changed. And it's not the coke. - Did you talk to him? - No one can talk to him. He ruined our questioning with Goncalvez. Shitl Did you think the bastard raped the girls? We'll soon find out. Hello. We'd like to speak to your wife. She was summoned, but didn't show up. Either she sees us or we'll take you both away. This is Mrs Goncalvez. This man and woman from the police want to know why you didn't go and see them. Because she can't. Look at her. If you wouldn't mind leaving us, we would like to talk to your wife. Madam, may I? Let's switch it off. There we are. We'd like to ask you some questions about your husband. You have... You have two daughters, don't you? Your two daughters, Iris and Muriel. Ever noticed anything strange between your husband and your daughters? - No? - No. I don't know anything. Have you seen anything suspicious? If you know anything... It's for your daughters. Do you understand? They are your daughters. You don't want them to come to harm. Shitl I don't know anything. I'm tired and sick. Sit down. We know little about her life in France. She didn't tell us everything. You can't tell your parents everything. We're very touched that you have come to talk about Elina. Thank Mr Clement. It was his idea. If you cry, I won't dare say anything. Yes. Tell me more, please. She told me a lot about you. It was almost a joke... When I complimented her she would say, "I get that from Mum" or "I get that from Dad." That kept her from leaving. She didn't want to be far from you. And Sofia? Did you know her? No. I... Elina told me a lot about her, but the opportunity never came up. She said they went to the theatre and museums together. She was so young. Having met the parents, she must have been a great girl. - Are you trying to make me cry? - I'm sad for you, that's all. That's kind of you. Why did Elina never introduce you to her sister? I don't know. Shall I drop you off? I won't help you catch Benoit Faye. He has nothing to do with Elina Andrescu's death, or her sister's death. Why are you so certain? He was in love with Elina and didn't even know Sofia. Judicially, it's a bit weak. If there's nothing to blame him for, why steal the diary? Report me as an accomplice to theft, then. Your career will suffer. I want, just as much as you do, to bring those responsible to justice. I don't want to hound an innocent friend. For such a price, I don't care about my career. You're wrong to just go for anyone. I want to know who killed this girl. You should have left Mr Laborde out of this. It was impossible. He is mentioned in the victim's diary. And? I might also be in there. - I assure you you're not. - Anyone could be in there. And where is this diary? We would very much like to know. - Did Mr Laborde tell you that? - Pardon? - He would also like to see it. - That's understandable. So, the diary? It has disappeared and you know. Have you lost it? Someone stole it from me. So, you are hassling everyone with a diary that doesn't exist. How was it stolen from you? If you suspect anybody, please say so now. Yes? I'm coming. Miss Goncalvez, we're interviewing you as a witness regarding your father. Your testimony will be recorded so we won't need to question you again. - Ready? - Yes. To start with, tell me your name and age. My name is Iris Goncalvez. I'm thirteen years old. I'm in year eight at school. - Do you live with your parents? - Yes. How are your parents? My mother is always ill. She doesn't look after me. And your father? - Does he take care of you? - He does the shopping. He gives me money. Do you see him as a normal father? He gets angry when I get bad marks. Is that all? We interviewed your mother. She didn't confirm your accusations. Nor your sister's. Did she say he didn't touch her? No, but she didn't say he had. Your father must have denied it. - Does he think I reported him? - No. He thinks it is a neighbour. - You don't believe me. - Of course I do. If you don't press charges, we can't do anything. If I do, will he be arrested immediately? No. Maybe not immediately. - He'll know straightaway it's me. - Yes. There's no way out. If we interrogate him, he might confess. Then, it will be all right. He will be detained straightaway until the trial. And if he doesn't? Never. No. Never. - Is your daughter lying? - Absolutely. Why is she the only one to accuse me? Who says it is just her? Listen. She is accusing me to avenge her mother. What can I say? I cheated on my wife, yes. But touching girls... Never. That is... It's priest-talk going to her head. Dad... you made me suffer. I loved you as my father, and you raped me every day. You knew I didn't want to, but you did it anyway. So, say it now, that you forced me. Say how you stopped me from crying out. Admit it all, you disgusting man. That's not good, is it? I'm ashamed that you are accusing me to get attention. He has done a lot worse than what I have told you. - That's enough. - He killed a man. He killed a black worker. Shut up, you little bitch! Calm down! Calm down! I'm asking you to sit back down. You can see she's saying what she likes. It was a Wednesday. I remember because of school. There was a worker who worked a little apart from the others. My father lowered the window and he shot him. The worker fell, but no one heard because of the noise on the building site. Then, we left. Are you sure he died on that day and at that place? Yes. The following day I went back to the building site. I asked a foreman if someone had died. - And was it the case? - Yes. He mentioned an accident. I left as I thought he was hand in glove with my father. Did this worker know your father? No, he just wanted to show me that he was capable of doing it, so I would stop resisting him. Paul has agreed to help us. I saw. That's interesting. I'll summarise. Stop me if I have got anything wrong. Your client entrusted her baby to a nutter who killed it and cut it into pieces, like some sort of voodoo ritual. - Right? - That's it. The nanny was declared unfit, but that's not all. The in-laws pressed charges because the mother had chosen the nanny on purpose. That's it. The mother finds herself in court. I don't understand. - The judge sided with the in-laws. - He had to. Not at all. He decided to. - Can we bring him down? - Yes, we can. Listen, I'll take care of it. - I just need to meet the mother. - I don't see why. Why? For an article. Paul is going to write an excellent one. OK, but why? The proceedings are ridiculous. The prosecution office is on our side. Our client doesn't need that. We need it, or rather you do. The idea is to talk about you, isn't it? So, that morning, before going to work, you entrusted your baby to a nanny. Was it the usual nanny? - Had you known her a while? - Since I went back to work. That evening, you come home and the child is dead. No, I didn't come home. It was the police who came to find me. So it wasn't you who informed the police? It was a neighbour. You didn't discover the tragedy? The baby had already been taken. You didn't see him? Only answer if you want to, of course. I could have seen him in the morgue. - But... - You didn't have the courage to. I understand why I'm being accused. Would you mind if we took a photo? Hello, it's the police. Mrs Gombomoy, please. Hello. It's me. We have some questions regarding your husband's death. OK, wait for me. I'll come and join you. Hello. I had always known that my husband had been killed. But I never understood why. Everyone liked him. At work, on the building sites - there was never a problem. - Why did you think it was murder? - He had a hole in his head. Like that. Just there. It was murder. I saw it when his body was taken away. - You didn't say anything? - Of course I did. No one believed me. The doctor said it was an accidental death. And the delirium of an African woman. Afterwards, didn't you try to press charges? I was a widow out of work, with five children and a pathetic pension. Will you allow us to exhume the body... to go ahead with an autopsy? Do I have to sign anything? - Yes. - Very well. I'll sign it. Thank you. - Mrs Androux? - I would like to see the judge. You have no reason to. It's over. I want to see the judge! If you shout, I'll kill myself! - Wait. - I want to see the judge! - I'll go and find him. - Wait there. Don't move. If you let my colleague go, we can talk, the two of us. Is that what you want - to talk? There's no need to hurt yourself. Go on. Close the door. - If you want to see me, you just... - Keep quiet. I wanted to tell you that you are a cruel and nasty man. My baby has been killed and you want to convict me for his death. Do you want to make me suffer? Is that what you want? Stop hurting yourself. Hurt? You're the one hurting me. - Accusing me of killing my son. - I didn't accuse you. It's not for me to say. I'm the examining judge. It's the same word, but it's the court that passes judgment. Only a court can decide if you're innocent or if you're guilty, not me. But I haven't done anything. I'm not guilty. You have been accused. That's why you have been sent to court. So, they tell your in-laws that you're not guilty. Once they let you go, they will not be able to accuse you. That's why there's a lawsuit. Now, you need to take care of yourself. It's over now, in any case. I attacked you. I'll be arrested. No, you wanted to talk. The court will not favour your in-laws. They will see there's no reason for you to be there. Hi. - You're late. - Yes. I'm sorry. So, I've prepared a memo. A memo? It's quite short. There's not much to say. There's no need for a memo. We can talk. Every time I try, you change the subject. But we can take our time. Read it. If you agree, we'll choose a lawyer together. - I trust you. - No. Read it. Do we agree to get divorced? We are not going to take all year. Thank you. Hi, Francis. - Bye - Bye. Thank you. Shit, Francis! - No, listen. - No. It's OK. - We're not going to leave like this. - That's it. I thought I wanted to. I was wrong. - That's it. - Sorry. Stop. - Stop. - Listen to me. No. I don't want to... Wait. I'm sorry for having spoilt your evening. - Stop, stop! - Are you playing with me? Stop being crazy. Are you going to stop or what? That's enough, now! Are you going to calm down? Get it? - This is insane. - OK. Get going. We will forget everything. Have you seen the time? Look at the state you're in. Your make-up is a mess. That will make a good impression in court. And you've been drinking. I can smell it from here. Have some chewing gum, so your breath doesn't smell. Show them you're confident. Don't look guilty. The press will support you. Even the prosecutor is on your side. - The prosecutor? - Prosecutor Cl?ment. You met him. And here. Put this on. You look like you've come out of a squat. And for pity's sake, don't mumble before the court. I wanted to ask you what I'm doing here. My baby is dead. My life is destroyed. I'm being accused. - It's a nightmare. - No. It's just justice. I know it's a shock, if we are unfamiliar with it. That's why you need to trust me, OK? Good luck. We will get through it. Ghislaine Androux case. I remind you that I will not tolerate any outbursts. Anyone who causes a disturbance will be sent out. This is a court not a gallery. It's even less so a press area. Justice must not be confused with the public press. Please come forward. - The court is deliberating. - Thanks for telling me. - Are the press articles down to you? - They were good, weren't they? - The president wasn't pleased. - Excuse me. I have to see my client. - It's not helpful. I was on your side. - We had to oppose the other party. I hope the court doesn't dig its heels in. I wanted to ask you. It has nothing to do with this, but I'm going to need a solicitor. - You? - I'm getting divorced. - Would you agree to it? - Wait. It's not my area. - Nor mine. - Is there a certificate of marriage? Our estates are separate, I wrote a memo. We are agreed. Do you know why I'm asking you? You're helping young lawyers from modest backgrounds? No. I want someone who is not interested in it. No gossip. Nothing psychological. No pity. No remarks. You couldn't care less? - Completely. - I thought so. OK, I will take care of your divorce. What do we do? Shall I contact the press or will you do it? - No, they won't be interested. - That's a shame. The court, after having deliberated, finds you guilty for not assisting a person in danger. You are discharged of the rest. However, considering the death of the child constitutes a painful damage for Mrs Androux, whose current behaviour is not harmful to public order, the court will not impose any punishment. Case number four. - I don't understand. Am I convicted? - Only on paper. - But I have been convicted. - Yes, but for nothing. It's OK. We've won. So she's not going to prison? No, she's been convicted which is the important thing. Convicted of what? No prison, no fine, that's not a conviction. There's no need to be upset. We've won. Come on. Don't stay here. Case number seven. The Sylvie Courteau case. The court reconvenes... You looked at this five years ago. A worker who died on a building site. Yes, I vaguely remember. - You concluded it was an accident. - Yes. The guy didn't have a hard hat. We found his head covered in blood on a perpend. He had fallen. I never understood from where and why. We did an autopsy. What? Five years later? He had a bullet in his head. Apparently, the wound was visible. The problem with Africans is their frizzy hair. Why do you want to go into it? An inquest will be opened. The family will want to press charges. Against me? Otherwise, it's me who will be conducting an inquiry against you. OK, I see which side you are on. I won't say goodbye. Come in. He's the one who signed Mr Gombomoy's death certificate. I've never met such an idiot. Is something wrong? We deciphered the receipt found on Sofia's coat. And? It was used to buy a book in the Gustave Moreau museum. Yes, I know. It was Benoit Faye's card. It was him who paid. I have made you wait for me. Sorry. - No, no. - Come in. Sit down. We found this in Sofia Andrescu's coat. This receipt is for the purchase of a book at the Gustave Moreau museum. A payment made with your bank card. That's true, yes. I presume you have an explanation. She liked the book. I gave it to her as a gift. You never said you knew Sofia Andrescu. I was never asked. This purchase is from a while ago. You were never asked? Will you stop lying? Stop for a minute. Stop! The man whom your daughter talked of was killed by a bullet. Maybe, but I'm here for no reason. The examining judge will try to establish that. My daughter hates me because of her mother. What can I do about it? I didn't ask her to start drinking. You are a violent man, Mr Goncalvez. You reign terror over those around you. I'm not violent. I'm just not a pushover. You have eight guns at home. You killed Mr Gombomoy with one of them for no reason. You raped both your daughters. Iris confirmed her sister's accusations. I'm here for no reason. I'm here for no reason. I didn't touch them. No one touches them. I killed the black guy but I have never touched my daughter. I didn't touch her. Do you hear? I didn't touch her. "I killed the black guy." See what it does to you when you can't admit to things? He can't recognise the fact that he raped them. It's too bad. Will you help me put the desk back? Thanks. - He didn't hurt you? - No. I should be asking you that. - Are you OK? - I'll be fine. OK. Ghislaine Androux threw herself off a bridge. I heard. I've stopped drinking. Just water now. Don't look at me like that. She's dead because of us. Are you not bothered? No, don't think that. It does bother me. I just don't like showing my feelings. I tell you as a lawyer, I've learned one thing. Guilt is not a good choice. I'll try to remember. You look better without the beard. You are really sweet. Yes. - Am I disturbing you? - No, please come in. I have come to thank you. The president called you in and you said nothing about the diary. I had to admit that I no longer had it. Could you be ousted? Probably not. It would be better to keep me. I'll be less obstructive. You know I can't do any more. In any case, I have no more ideas. Who is this guy? He's strange. Excuse me. Would you happen to know this person? Maybe you have seen her before. She used to come here often. No, I don't know her. I'm only here on Wednesdays and Saturdays. No problem. Your friend Pierre Cl?ment almost surprised me in the museum. Do you still go there? I go where I want. I don't like being troubled. I appeased the examining judge. You are taking care of your school friend. He must be more relaxed now. I don't want a prognostic. I want a commitment. I want that prosecutor to leave me alone. It's your responsibility. - You will do it. - And if I don't? And if you don't...
