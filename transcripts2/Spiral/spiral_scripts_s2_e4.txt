 You knew about the barbecue? - What's it to do with Rachid? He's accused of murder. An accusation of murder could make him talk. Make sure his wife and kid are okay. Especially his wife. Did Aziz hurt you? He'll pay for this. I'll talk to the judge. That's for Szabo. He wants to spill the beans. We'll teach you. Aziz isn't alone. - Let's watch him. There's a vacant flat overlooking Aziz's.

 We've been spotted. We're in trouble! Take this, I'm off. Hello, sir. - Hello. Here you are, sir. - Thank you. Hello. I won't shake hands. It's not pretty in here. Andr? Giraud, aged 45. Stabbed to death. He's been dead two to three weeks. Is this him? - I guess that's what he looked like. A retired rugby player. Are those stab wounds? - Yes. Could you turn the body over? - Go ahead.

 There's a deep wound at the throat and two smaller ones probably done with the same weapon. Did you find the knife? - Yes. Knife, please. Thanks. The fingerprints have been wiped off. It looks like someone suddenly lost it and lashed out. Why? The mess, the fingerprints, the slapdash attempt to wipe them off... We'll take the cushions and the rug to look for traces of semen. Here's the best bit. Can we have the photo album? I'll let you have a look. Thank you. Where are they? In a club? - Yes. Have you identified it? - Not yet. We'll start with that. The photos at the end are missing. Someone probably removed them to get rid of any link to the victim. The skirmishes prevented residents from going home through streets littered with burning cars. 29 in all. The unrest started when youths discovered a police hideout. 0lder community members tried to calm the youths, to no avail. The estate was calm tor months. Can't you leave them alone? Who, Mr Mayor? The thugs who control the estate? Let me show you the shots taken by my officers. The traffic involves 300 kilos of cannabis a week and more and more heroin. It's a parallel economy. Not to mention gangland killings, racketeering and the like. Your model estate for decent folk is a failure. How did he spot you? The technician forgot to encode the signal from the hideout to the truck. A neighbour saw the suspect on his TV. Miss Karlsson for Rachid Abderamane. I just need... to call someone. Campeau here, sir. Could you tell the director Miss Karlsson's here? Yes. Okay, sir. One moment... What's going on? My meeting's at 10.15. I know. I was about to call you. Hello. I've got terrible news. Mr Abderamane hung himself. I beg your pardon? I'm sorry. Is he dead? Are you telling me my client's dead? The body has been transferred for the autopsy. We'll send you the results if you wish. How does it feel to kill a man? Does leaking a file pay well? Let me pass. Who did you talk to? It's your fault. You killed him! What's wrong with you? - Bitch... Don't you start as well. - Give it a break. Rachid got himself into a gang that isn't usually very welcoming. You know the game. A gang leader gets outside instructions to take a newcomer under his wing in exchange for which the new guy owes total loyalty. Who took him in? - Abdelkrim Zarzar, aka Krimo. Nice guy. 20 years for multiple murders. All stabbings. What happened? Did they argue? Did Rachid rebel? No idea. One minute Rachid's protected. The next he's on his own. No one would talk to him. It was as if he had the plague. He didn't kill himself just because no one talked to him. Did anything happen? Was there an incident? No. Inspector... Why did he tear up the photo? Maybe she screwed around. I don't know. We shared a cell for a week. We weren't close. Maybe not, but you lent him money to get a phone. Not a lot of money. Who got him the phone? - No idea... You can easily get hold of one round here. And they change chips all the time. When did he buy his? - Tuesday, after recreation. I heard him tell the guard he'd be transferred the next day. To see the judge? - Yes. Two hours later, he got done in the shower. What do you mean, "done"? I see. Could Krimo be involved in this? - I don't know. You're really giving me the shits now! Who raped Rachid? Look at me when I talk to you! Do what you want. l'm out of here in six months. I want to get out of here alive. Police. We want to see your boss. - Go ahead. I feel like I'm dreaming. - Why? It's quite nice here. Gentlemen... Lieutenant Escoffier? - Can we talk somewhere? Of course. Please sit down. Excuse me. I was... - Stop that or you're nicked. It's a bit much. I was very upset by your phone call. I was very fond of Andr? Giraud. He didn't deserve this. What do you mean by "very fond"? The same as you. May I? Do you have a light? - No. We were lovers once. We were still close. He was here nearly every night. It was his second home in a way. Can you switch that off? Yes, but it might take a while. I'm by myself. Never mind. He used to be an international rugby player. What did he live on afterwards? Income support. Plus the occasional fee as a party host. What kind of parties? Not your usual bar mitzvah celebration. Andr? liked men, sex... He had no hang-ups and a lot of imagination. He was fun. Everyone liked him. Everyone? He wasn't himself those last months. He had a lover. And? He became touchy... violent. The guy was driving him nuts. I felt sorry for him... but he was smitten. Bastard. Could we have the lover's contact details? It doesn't work that way here. People don't give names or addresses. A first name, a nickname. You're someone else here. - I guess so. I have some photos. It was Andr?'s birthday last month. His lover was there. I'll go and get them. Drink? l'll have... - Nothing. For either of us. Grumpy old thing... Have you been together long? It's not what you think. Rachid killed himself simply because his wife had a lover. She had a lover? Who? Aziz. He found out his wife wanted to leave him for Aziz. He couldn't bear it. It's quite understandable. Strange how it happened just after I called you... Think what you want. It's got nothing to do with it. Rachid was only an underling. He didn't have much on anyone. You didn't always say that. I only said I wanted to be kept informed. Would I entrust the defence of a big shot to an unknown lawyer? Have you completed the conveyancing of the cafe? It took a while to get the forms from the Land Registry. Bring the file to my office today. I want to read over it before tomorrow. You'll have it tonight. To answer your question, it wasn't staged. He really did hang himself. The windpipe is crushed here. The blood flow was cut off in both jugular veins. It happened after the rape. He was held on the floor for quite some time. They ran the shower afterwards so we haven't found any hair. And no DNA either. They wore protection. This definitely proves premeditation. I won't cry over him but I can't stand having a witness knocked off right under my nose. I'm quite sure you can't, Inspector. Have you thought about my offer? I have. If l'm offered the job, l'll take it. Finally... I'm glad to see you're not totally dim. I'll set up a game with the Chief Prosecutor and the president of the Appeal Court. You need a medal too. I'll nominate you for the Merit. Before or after I'm a prosecutor? After. There'd be no point before. Excuse me. I won't be long. Yes, Lieutenant? We have a suspect. A soldier. A fighter pilot from Chartres air base. We'll have to tread carefully. Are you sure? The club owner identified him. We found his fingerprints on the page with the missing photos. I called our colleagues in Chartres. They don't go near the airbase. The military police take over then mum's the word. It's not like they cover up, but they don't like civilians poking their noses in. We'll have to be smart. I'll talk to Prosecutor Machard. You do that. - Okay. Okay. Easy does it. How was your little game of tennis? Good, thank you. I'm glad to hear it. Did you know my sole witness in the barbecue case hung himself in his cell? Rachid Abderamane? - The very same. I was surprised to find his unsigned statement in his file... about Alicia Perez. You had agreed to keep it aside till the suspect's arrest. You misunderstood me. I said to follow procedure. Now Rachid's dead. Smart move, wasn't it? Your Honour, I don't think the file was leaked. You can sit down, Pierre. I'd like to discuss this matter further. - We most certainly will. Rachid saw his wife. For some reason, it went badly. It left him in a real state. He hired a phone with his cellmate's money. He was overheard talking about seeing the judge the next day. We think he called his lawyer to arrange a meeting with you. Miss Karlsson never called me. Didn't she? She has her snout in every trough. She must have called Rachid's boss. Maybe Aziz, maybe someone else. Aziz isn't big enough to get someone killed in jail. Are you sure she didn't try to contact you? Positive. So Rachid's dead. Mr Aziz ditched his mobile phones and vanished. All we have now is Krimo's visitors. He led the gang who raped Rachid. Tailing his visitors could lead somewhere. Let's tap the visiting room. The inmates will find out. They'll smell a rat. Not if a prison warden sets it up overnight. They'll see nothing to be suspicious about. I'll talk to the prison director. Your Honour... Good evening. Good evening. This won't take long. I have something to show you. Aren't we due to meet soon? - I won't be able to show you this. I wasn't sure I should give them to you. But now you can see who you're dealing with. I don't like this kind of approach. Throw them away, then. I wanted to set things straight but who cares anyway? It's all about bashing cops. Isn't that what they're for? Is this worth 5000 euros? Let's say it'll make up for the loss of a client. All I have to do is record the sale, right? Will your client be there? - Along with his bodyguard. I see. Say no more. Miss Karlsson... To work for me, you have to love money and nothing else. I thought we saw eye to eye on that front. Okay... Thanks for a great evening. Thanks for listening. It's that wine. Any old rubbish sounds good with a nice wine. Did you know... Br?an could be our next minister? I was asked to use you to dig up some information about him. Will you? Me? - Will you use me? No. I don't think so. Mind you... No. I never go overboard for a scoop. Would kissing a prosecutor make a scoop? No. No? But it really is going overboard. I'm surprised, Pierre. A murder is committed in Paris. The suspect, whoever he is, should by law be apprehended. There's law and there's common practice. You know that. Arresting an officer for a crime so... - So what? Flustered by murderous poofters, are you? I thought you less puritanical... The champion of true justice and fair policing. If you mean that article... I mean to warn you against befriending journalists. People talk. You, the courts' watchdog, could end up smeared for going easy on certain social categories. Thank you for the compliment. I'll inform the suspects superiors that he will be taken into custody. Don't let them fob you off. Have no fear. Detained for questioning? Do you know what it's like to be a fighter pilot? What nerves of steel it requires? Composure, vigilance... values of courage and self-denial... How could such a man lose control to the point where he brutally murders a stranger? Would you please call Lieutenant Boussac, Colonel? Call Boussac in. His father-in-law is General de ChActeauvieux. The army's chief of staff. Everyone knows who he is, Colonel. - Good. Maybe that will help you avoid a miscarriage of justice. Come in. May I introduce Lieutenant Boussac. I'm ready, Colonel. Lieutenant Boussac's custody is starting at... I don't have the time. 3.15 p.m. The brothers say hello. - Thanks. Likewise. How's Rachid? It's our guy. He couldn't stand being in jail. He killed himself. On his own? - On his own. A warden found him. Did the cops come? - They came and went. How's my mother? Fine. Is my scummy brother Abdel taking care of her? We're looking after her. She has all she needs. Did she say she was short of anything? I'll tell the brothers about Rachid. Poor thing... Who could the brothers be? Muslim brothers? These guys aren't the mystical type. Let's go. He's coming out! - Get ready to move. He's driving a grey Mercedes 4WD with a 93 registration. He's leaving the car park. He's turning left towards Paris. Steph, Pascal, are you ready? Steph, he's yours. - I've got him. If he speeds up, we're stuffed in this heap of junk. What the hell is that car doing? The bastard's taking a fucking exit. He turned off at Porte de Vincennes. - I've got him. We'll wait at the next exit. Receiving? Where are you, Steph? Receiving? - Yes. I can't see him. He isn't filling up. Either it's a security check or he went tor a piss. Here he is. He's coming out. He's walking back to his car. He's getting in. He's about to drive off. He's leaving the petrol station. Okay! He's heading to the ring road, towards Porte de Bagnolet. Okay. We're taking the ring road. He's joining the traffic... Right lane. We're at Porte de Bagnolet, now heading towards Bobigny on the A3. A3 towards Bobigny. He's putting his foot down. He's speeding up. Left lane, everyone. Steph, we can't keep up. Steph here. He's exiting at Bobigny. It's okay. I've got him. It's another security check. Avoid the roundabout. I'm out of here. The fucker has lost us. Where are you, Steph? - Third exit. Check the second one... - Here he is. Got him! All units! First road off the roundabout! Bloody hell... What the hell is he doing now? Here we go. All units, abort tailing. We're going home. Nadir Badaoui, aka the one-eyed man. Arrested in 1997 for armed robbery. That's interesting! Look... Ten years ago he was arrested with a Mustapha Larbi at 30 Avenue des Thuyas. Isn't that the house we ended at? - It is. Key in Larbi. - I just did. We've got three pages on them. Them? - Yes. Two brothers. Mustapha and Farouk, 30 Avenue des Thuyas... The brothers behind Rachid's murder. Suicide. - Same difference. Mustapha Larbi. Eight years for armed robbery and drug trafficking. He got out three years ago. Show us the other one. Farouk. The younger. Finished school! He's the brains. Five years for fraud, falsification, extortion. Released for good behaviour. Hasn't reoffended. That's good. Shall I print it? Hello. I'm Miss Karlsson. I've been waiting an hour. I'm sorry. Mr Szabo told me 11 a.m. It's now 10.58. Shall I get you a drink? I've changed my mind. I'm not selling. I can pay you back with interest. It's too late. It was the first time. My wife was sick in hospital. I had to close for a few days. We said the 15th. You didn't pay on the 15th. What am I supposed to do? Wait? Wait for your wife to come out of hospital? Wait for you to go back to work? This cafe is all I have left, Farouk. What do they say about me? Am I into business or charity? Wait... Please. l'll pay double. Sign and stop being a pain in the arse. I don't have a pen. He doesn't have a pen. Sign here. What? 20,000 euros? I'd rather die. I'm getting bloody sick of you. Get out of my caf?. Out of here! What are you doing here? Get back to your room. In your room! Hello there. What's your name? Farouk! Leave my daughter alone. You're pretty. And you... Please leave my daughter alone. How old are you? Look... I'll sign. Put her down. Until we have high-tech interview rooms, videos and two-way mirrors like in movies we have to make do. It will be just fine. Are we ready yet? - Nearly, boss. You're right to be careful with the army. Can you see? It's fine, thank you. Thanks. - Is that okay? Well then, Lieutenant Boussac... I'm full of admiration for the job you do. It takes a lot of balls. What am I here for exactly? I'm getting to that. I need a few background details first. Education, family and so on... Only child. Father, engineer. Mother, primary school teacher. Both died in a car crash when I was 17. Six years of tertiary studies at the School of Aeronautics. Then the army. How did you meet the general's daughter? I hear she's hot. Any more of that and I'll smash your face in. I'll happily do time for that. I hope you know what you're doing. He won't break easily. I'm sorry. I thought you didn't give a stuff about her. You're suspected of murdering Andr? Giraud, your lover. Are you calling me a homosexual? Having male lovers tends to classify men as such. I won't take insults. Not by you, nor by anyone. I understand... A guy like you, healthy, level-headed... a lighter pilot, must really get the shits being a poof. I want a lawyer. Your colonel's seeing to it. Let's wait, then. Let's wait. He won't break. He might. Do you mind if I try? If you feel you can do it. Without the DNA test, I don't have enough to break him. I have an idea. Can I try? - Go ahead. I have a suggestion. It's strictly confidential. Can I count on your discretion? Go ahead. You come from what they call a good family. You have great respect for your wife. I adore my wife. I have a problem, Lieutenant. Your fingerprints were found on Giraud's album. My fingerprints? The missing photos probably show his last lover. If the fingerprints are yours, you must have removed them. All right... I went there once. When I realised what he was after, I left. We found semen on Andr? Giraud's sheets. DNA tests are under way. If it's yours, your wife will be asked how often you have sex each week. Every soldier at the base will be asked if you ever made a pass at them, if they knew... The club owner will be called in as a witness. So will the other clients. They'll describe what you did there. Giraud's friends will drag your name through the mud. I won't be able to stop the rumour mill. I won't be able to stop people looking at you like... Like I'm queer. You can still save your honour if that word means anything to you. It does. I know. That's why I'm offering you a way out. If you admit what happened, The investigating judge won't need your family. The hearings will take place at night. We can ask for your trial to be held in camera. You'll be judged for killing a man, not for anything else. He was foul. A bastard. It was never vile enough... never disgusting enough for him. So... I put an end to his demands. Well done, sir. It was brilliant. Thank you. Come in. Chief Prosecutor Machard to see you. Is he here? - He isn't alone. Show him in. What a surprise, sir. This is General de Ch?teauvieux, Mr Boussac's father-in-law. General... - Superintendent. This is Mr Cl?ment, the young assistant prosecutor in charge of the case. General... You have all my sympathy. You have no sympathy whatsoever. Your justice belongs to the gutter and you're about to make a mistake. What the general means is that your suspect has an alibi. He was with the general and the rest of his family. I'm sorry, General. Lieutenant Boussac has just signed a confession. The investigating judge will remand him in custody. I'm sorry, General. I understand this comes as a shock. Prosecutor... if my son-in-law goes to jail, you can kiss your career goodbye. Let me show you out, General... What possessed you? Are you mad? What do you mean? We agreed... No. You misunderstood. I told you to be careful. Why didn't you listen? It's too late to make up for that. You're finished. Finished. Did it work? We have three names and an address. We have to tail the Larbis and prove the links between the groups. Excellent. Are you all right, Pierre? - I'm fine, thank you. They're big fish, right? - Quite big. Maybe the Drug Squad could take over. It's their job, isn't it? Is it something I did? Not at all. Don't take it like that. They're technically better equipped. It's nothing to do with you. Have you discussed it amongst yourselves? We explored the idea. Do you want them arrested? It will be yet another case for the Drug Squad. By the time they get onto it it'll be too late. What if you can't trace the trail back to the top? Why couldn't we? Are we too dumb? No, but your hands are full already. Do you know what you're full of, Your Honour? I don't like that. She's on edge at the moment. - That's no excuse. We'll call the Technical Assistance Service. They're undercover specialists. They're used to working with us. You'll inform Laure about this. I'd rather you did it. You're friends. - Precisely. You have more authority. I'm sorry. Hello, Robert... I accuse Inspector Berthaud of harassment of my client. Her relentless intimidation and surveillance have left him prey to anxiety attacks, unable to leave home. Inspector? Very funny. You've seen the photos. What photos? This clearly supports our harassment charge. Along with our latest piece of evidence, this all points to a very alarming situation. What evidence? - Your client's psychiatric history. What are you talking about? You were admitted to a psychiatric ward at age 16. This is a joke. I was there two days for mild anorexia. Thank you for going to so much trouble. I'm surprised you're not taking this more seriously. Maybe... Maybe I'm less of an arsehole than you are. I request a psychiatric assessment for your client. That will be all. Did it go okay with Wagner? No. Don't worry. Today must be Bastard Day. You don't look too good either. Is that what you call treading carefully? There was I praising your judgment. I look a bloody idiot. Should his homosexuality have been front page news? Couldn't you wait before starting an investigation? Didn't you see a confession would be trouble? On the contrary, it limits the damage. In the meantime, you look a right fool. A dangerous foo, too. Luckily, Machard warned me. I managed to withdraw your application. Did Machard call you? He told me you were uncontrollable. Coming from him, I take that as a compliment. Do you have a North African in custody? I don't think so. Laure... Is he one of yours? No, he isn't. Come with me. Are you coming for the line-up? - l'll be right there. That's it. You can go now. See you later. What the hell are you doing here? Lieutenant Samy Bouchara, Technical Assistance. I hear you need technical support. Hello.
