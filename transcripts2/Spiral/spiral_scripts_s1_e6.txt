 Previously... Could you see her face? - Nothing, she's been mutilated. The victim loses her diary before getting killed. The judge took the diary home. - He doesn't have it any more. What happened? - He must have left it lying around. We found Elina's sister's body in cold storage. Rubbish! You know more than the police. I ask the questions. You're the police's nark. I can't help you catch Benoit. He was in love with Elina. He had never met Sofia. Why did he want to steal the diary, then?

 We traced the bank slip we found in Sofia's pocket. And? - It belonged to Benoit Faye. You never mentioned that you knew Sofia Andrescu. No one ever asked me. - Will you stop lying? Stop lying! Promise me the prosecutor will leave me alone. And if I don't? And if you don't... I got your message. You wanted to talk to me. Elina Andrescu... The enquiry is at a standstill. What can I do? - She was your friend. I've already told you, she was more than that. The police and a judge are on the case, so why get involved?

 I feel like I'm the only person who cares about the outcome of this case. Roban has dropped it. It's doing your head in. You should drop the case, too. I'm not dropping it, Benoit. Haven't you understood that yet? I want us to stop fighting. - I didn't come here to fight with you. Here, the keys to your flat. I won't be needing them any more. I realise I'm living at your place. - It's not you living here any more. I lent the flat to this sane guy and now he's disappeared. But stay as long as you need to. - I don't want to be in your debt. Are you moving out? Are you going back to your wife? Has she agreed? Does she even know? Here, I bought you some croissants. The victim is a woman, about 40 years old, lying on her back... on a settee covered with a quilt and cardboard boxes. Right arm up by her face. The firemen found her like that. - Who alerted them? The neighbours did because of the smell. What have you to go on? One thing is for sure, the killer is no junkie. He would never have left that. The firemen found the door closed. There's no sign of a break-in. If it was someone she knew, she would have let them in. Can we continue this outside? Chief Inspector? Why put her under these boxes? Mrs Cosse, this is Chief Inspector Berthaud. Good morning. Shit! Poor Christiane! Could you repeat what you just told me? It's her ex-husband. He was always asking for money. If she refused, he hit her. They weren't even married any more. When do you think she died? The swelling of the eyelids would suggest a week or so. In this heat it could be less. This woman has been hit more than once. Any recent signs? - Do you see this bruise? Where? - On her temple. The blood flowing into her ear suggests a fracture, a haemorrhage even. Could it have killed her? - The autopsy will confirm that. SPIRAL Mr Ferro? - Yes. Do you know why we're here? No, but I'm sure you will tell me. It's the police. I've done stupid things and paid the price. This is about your wife's death. Oh, yes. What can I say? She was ill. She suffered from depression. You don't seem bothered. We'd been separated for ages. But you went to see her? I couldn't just abandon her. I made sure she ate, took her pills. And you left with her money? - She did lend me some, yes. She wasn't exactly rich. - She had her disability allowance. If she didn't agree to lend you any, you beat her up. This time you went too far. - What bullshit! I didn't kill her. Just because I've been inside! This is different. You were the last to see her alive. So what? - Calls were being made on her mobile. The calls were made from your area. I remember now. She lent it to me. Mine was fucked. - Of course it was. Shall I fill it up? - No, thank you. See you around. He's so cocky! He thinks we haven't enough evidence. But are we going to bring him in? - You bet! As soon as we get the autopsy results. It is divorce by mutual consent? Have you read the settlement? It's simple. There are no children. Your estates are separated. You are the sole owner of the flat, Mrs Cl?ment. You will appear before a judge. He'll want to check that you're both in agreement. I don't think we have any doubts. - I mean you, personally. It was Pierre's decision and I agree. Are you not likely to work things out? I know that can happen. Are you a specialist? - Not at all. I've never divorced, or even lived with anyone. But as your lawyer, I'm obliged to ask you. I've done my research. Can we work it out? No. If you agree with the settlement, I'll talk to the judge. He wanted to ask for your help? - Yes. Your friend is no ordinary guy. After all you did say. Has he not understood he needs to look elsewhere? He will not stop. You're worried because he's your friend. He has been since we were kids. It doesn't mean he can cause trouble. You can tread carefully, be humane if you want... but don't be weak. They barged in. They're searching the trucks. Here. Thanks. She's the boss. This is my husband, Mr Cl?ment. Pleased to meet you. Marie Meyer, customs officer. I know you're doing your job, but my wife is distraught. As we explained to her, we're checking for drug trafficking. Do you have any reason to suspect her firm of trafficking? We've had a tip-off. I'm not supposed to say, but it's from a very reliable source. I see. We'll be as discreet as possible, sir. Do they have the right to do that? Like the tax office, they can do what they like. If you have nothing to hide, there's no problem. At worst, you'll get a fine. I know being searched is horrible. Thanks for coming. We only meet for a crisis now. They're very thorough. It's most reassuring. Don't look so worried. We have nothing to fear. There's a truck missing. - Sorry? Who are you? - Robert Villequier. I'm the owner. Very well. The missing truck isn't on the schedule. It must be in the garage. The driver called to say it had broken down. It happens. Of course. I've been waiting ten minutes for a taxi at the Villequier depot. OK, fine. Thank you. Goodbye. Customs didn't just drop by. They don't drop by. - What were you hoping for? They found nothing. No wonder. I'd warned your father-in-law. He had time to hide what they were after. I won't warn him again. It's up to you now whether Marianne and her father get into trouble or not. Think of it as a bet. So, heads or tails? You can't stop me doing my job, Benoit. This is not about your job. You're prepared to sacrifice everything to be a hero. Including Marianne. Stop talking to me about Marianne. This is going to end in tears. Have you finished, Doctor? Yes, and it's not "doctor". It's "professor". I'm not used to being kept waiting. - We're dead on time. Yes, but I'm early. Anyway, there's not much work to do on her. You will be able to make up the overtime. Given the state of the heart and coronaries she obviously died of natural causes. No, that's not possible. There's a bruise on her temple. She got that when she fell. But she didn't fall. We found her on a main road. She didn't just lie down there. She was found dead at home, Professor. At home? - Yes, at home. Open that file for me, please. No, leave it there. Just open it. Oh, yes, at home. It's still the same. It doesn't change anything. The doctor who examined her suggested she might... Yes, I know. A fracture of the skull with a cerebral haemorrhage. Sorry to have to contradict that, but she died of a heart attack. But this woman was hit. Her ex-husband beat her when he wanted money. Her flat was ransacked. This woman was diabetic. She could have ransacked her own flat in search for a dose of insulin. Exactly. We found three doses of insulin and a syringe on a table. You may have found that. She didn't. It's crazy. He must have the wrong body. I'm hardly surprised. The trouble is he won't admit it. He will say it was a natural death. He can't do that! - He's not bothered. No crime, no murderer. The petrol pump attendant owes him big time. We can't let this happen. It's Medhi's fault. He wanted to swindle Naim over a drug deal. They did that to punish him. There were about thirty of them. Naim wanted us all to be there... to see what would happen to anyone who tried to cross him. So he forced you to watch the horrors he was subjecting your brother to? Mr Ralib, your brother, Medhi, is fighting for his life in the room next door. The doctors don't rate his chances of pulling through. If you want the perpetrators of the atrocities committed on your brother to be punished, you must tell us what went on in the basement. Medhi... They tied his arms up. Then... Naim... gave this man a blowtorch. Then, he forced him to burn my brother on his chest and on his stomach. Meanwhile... another man was cutting his hand with a Stanley knife. Medhi started to throw up. Naim wanted me to join in. I didn't want to. Is that why he hit you? It wasn't him. He doesn't get his hands dirty. It was... It was the others who laid into me. They totally did me in. I was punched and kicked. I woke up to the sound of my brother shouting. He was throwing himself around in every direction, screaming. To begin with, I couldn't understand why he was screaming like that. It was only after they left... I couldn't see why. I hadn't realised. What hadn't you realised? They'd cut his dick off. Do you recognise Medhi Ralib now, Mr Touami? From the way he looks there? It's hard to say. You can say that again. These photos were found in your home. My client is not the only one. All those questioned by the police were sent these photos. They don't stand accused of organising this torture. Yet my client does? - I'm not making this up. In the absence of concrete evidence, I'm surprised you give so much weight to a single anonymous denunciation. This testimony is not anonymous and I hope it will not be the only one. But for now it is. Out of dozens of witnesses, it is the only one to implicate Mr Taoumi. It's the law of silence. We have conflicting evidence the police can check. I suppose one of his friends was having a quiet chat with him when this happened. He was at home. His mother gave evidence, Judge. Motherly love can work miracles. But in spite of this timely testimony, I don't think your client's reputation and his past history leave us in any doubt. It's too late to worry about your reputation. I'm not worried. You stand accused of inflicting grievous bodily harm, followed by acts of torture and barbarity on Medhi Ralib. To prevent you from putting pressure on the witness you will be remanded in custody. Your lawyer will explain. You must be familiar with the procedure. Naim, are you OK? - Don't worry, Mum. I'm fine. The judge has asked for him to be remanded in custody but I have a good chance of getting him out. Get him out, but tell him this is the last time. I've spent too much time fetching him from police stations and courts. I'm tired of it. I can't take it any more. I can't help him any more. But he was at home with you that night? If I'm going to defend your son, I must know the truth. Was he really with you? You must tell me everything. Was he with you? Yes, he was with me. Why can't I ask for another autopsy? Technically, it's not easy to do, and this is Professor Bern. You know what he's like. He got it wrong. He thought the body was found on a main road. What do you want me to do? - I want you to get another autopsy. On what grounds? There's no crime so I can't start an inquiry. There is a crime. You were at her flat. You saw. I've traced some facts to her ex-husband. Is that not enough? If I challenge Bern, I'll have him on my back for the next ten years. I can't risk being on bad terms with him. Christiane Lavent is beaten to death by her ex-husband and we drop it? Elina was young and pretty so you want to find her killer. Christiane is old and ugly. Do you hand-pick your victims? OK, I'll see what I can do. I'll try and minimise the impact on Bern. Handy to have you as my conscience. - Just your conscience? An attractive conscience, OK? Is that how it works now? The police officers command and the public prosecutors obey. I was at the scene, Professor. This woman was killed. So now you're an expert in forensics? You can take my place if you like. Go on! Elizabeth. I'm not contesting your findings. - Really? They prevent me from going after the ex-husband. Why would you go after a man whose wife died a natural death? He hit her. No, you can count me out. Chief Inspector Berthaud, who you met... I would like to do this for her. Do you want to sleep with her? From what I've heard, it's doesn't take that much. All right, then. I'll see to it for you. I am a scientist after all. I'm not afraid of a second opinion. And if I can do you a favour... - Thank you. Will you let me know the details? Stop the car, Jean-Claude. Shit! Marianne, Customs have found the truck. Wait. Calm down. Let's try not to panic. I'm going to disappear for a few days. Meanwhile, act dumb. You don't know anything, you don't understand. Your father has told you nothing. OK? We'll get through this. Tell me, honestly, do you know anything about this? No. Nothing. I've already told you. What about your father? I don't know. I can't get hold of him. What's at stake here? Drug counterfeiting is a serious crime. It would imply some organisation, networks, accomplices. Could it mean a prison sentence? - Yes, it could. You won't go to prison. Get a good solicitor. I'll talk to the judge. It's going to be OK. Your father is the boss. It's up to him to explain this. Someone informed Customs, you know. Who could hate us that much? Do you want some chilli sauce? I don't know. We have no way of knowing. The prosecution supports the request for a period of remand. Unreservedly, Your Honour. - Over to you. Your Honour, you are asked to remand Mr Touami in custody to stop him putting pressure on witnesses. The witnesses are here. The police questioned dozens of people. None of them implicated Mr Touami, even when he was in prison. The most important testimony, in my view, is that of Mr Touami's mother. Mrs Touami knows that her son is a delinquent. He has been convicted many times in her presence. She has never testified in his favour. She has come forward as a woman of her word who has faith in the law. This is not yet a criminal hearing. We are not here to decide if your client is guilty or innocent. That will be all, Your Honour. There will be guaranteed representation. There have been no threats to witnesses. There is no proof of any offence. There is no justification for custody. Well done. You played it well. - Thank you. Your client seems happy. - Yes. He could have thanked you. About my divorce, we're dropping it. Either you want children or you're standing by her through her troubles. Everyone is talking about her father. Precisely. It would be the worst time to leave her. Like a rat leaving a sinking ship. Do what you like, divorce or stay together. Just keep me posted. Does your wife agree? - Yes. You always agree on everything. - Almost. See? We did it. - It was easy. It seemed easy because I was well prepared. Wow! Aren't you great! You're mates with that other bastard. - Mr Cl?ment? We were discussing another case. You do a deal with him and what does he get in return? Do you suck his dick? I'd give her one. - Of course you would. What am I supposed to say to the judge? Tell him what you know. - I hardly know anything. Then, it will be over sooner. I'm scared. He's seeing you as a witness, that's all. Will Dad be charged? Your father can explain himself when he gets back. There is nothing to say he's guilty. There are many explanations. Don't think about it. Just tell him what you know, that's all. Nothing more. Marianne Villequier. Marianne Cl?ment. - Yes. Judge Pernelle will see you now. See me in my office afterwards. We go in from Rue d'Hauteville... New forensic report. Death by natural causes. Just as I had feared. - Arseholes! It's not "arsehole", it's "professor." Let's talk to the suspect. - Ferro? Get him to confess. Stuff the forensic report. We can't do it. Is that it? - What? We tried. Forensics cheated us and all you say is, "We tried"? Have you a better idea? - No, but you should have. You let them treat you like shit. He shouldn't speak to you like that. Can you get him transferred? I'm sick of it. Enough is enough! It makes it look as if he's running away. This trip has been planned for weeks. My father regularly visits clients and suppliers abroad. He doesn't announce it. He prefers to turn up without warning. That way clients see he cares and suppliers can see he's in charge. No one knows where he is? He makes it up as he goes along. That's the idea. We go several days without hearing from him. Do these tours last a long time? It depends. I know it seems strange, but Dad has his own way of doing things. Yes, so I see. The second assessment confirms the first autopsy. Death by natural causes. I'm sorry I was so insistent. Br?mont is a former student of Bern's. He won't contradict him. Are you pissed off with me? - You were right. It had to be done. You're often right. It's getting annoying. I should have followed your advice in the Andrescu case. My advice? - To drop it. I never said that. I waded in and now it's a disaster. What's happening to Marianne is my fault. But it's your father-in-law who's mixed up in this, not you. Benoit is behind all this. One word from me and he would have stopped, but I didn't say it. That's because you're a decent man. What a nightmare! You were right. As long as Dad is away, they can't do anything. Come and tell me what happened. I want to ditch this job. - It's cool. You work when you like. You say, "I'm off to tail someone" and here you are with a ton of coke. I should be in the police. Would they have me? You don't know my boss. She's a ball-breaker. She's shagging the prosecutor. It's all work. No initiatives. Nothing. This man just bumped his wife off. We're doing nothing. He's having the last laugh. She just accepts it. - Who is she? My boss, Chief Inspector Berthaud, Laure. Get it? I don't understand anything you say. - Don't you believe me? I'll show you. Wait. No. Where are you off to? We're having fun. I'm sick of being taken for a fool and taking orders. I'll show them and stamp out the vermin. That's what the police are for. Come on, you lazy cow. Come on. Move it. You can sleep in the car. Hey, don't I get a kiss? Police! Police! Open up! What the hell's going on? Haven't you bugged me enough? Can I come in? - Have you a warrant? A warrant? - No warrant. Arsehole! He wants to see a warrant. Never mind. Let's go. - Never mind? The man wants a warrant. I'll give him a warrant. Look. I'll shove it in your face. What's your problem? Wait. Wait. Put that down! Admit that you beat her. Admit it. Stop it! - You did your wife in. Yes. It was me. - Say it. What do you mean, "It was me"? - I said it was me. Yes, I killed her. Stop! Stop! Can I see you? You're here, aren't you? Medhi Ralib, the man who was tortured, died this morning. His injuries were too severe. Have you seen the photos? I've seen them. Naim wasn't with me when it happened. He came home later. There was blood all over his clothes. I had to wash them. Are you withdrawing your statement? He told me the photos were rigged, that Medhi was hardly hurt. Do I have to go to the police? It's up to you. - That's not what I'm asking you. Should I go to the police or straight to the judge? Go and see the judge. But if you tell him I spoke to you, I won't be able to defend your son. Do you want to defend him? - Yes, I'm his solicitor. Thank you. Goodbye. - Goodbye. Shit! I'm telling you, he confessed to me. I don't understand. I went to see Ferro. He confessed. Pick him up. Are you mad? Ask Alyssa. She heard him confess. Stay there! Hi. Were you with Gilou? Can you tell me what happened? - I didn't see anything. Did Gilou threaten him? I said... I don't know. Chief Inspector Berthaud. - Gentlemen. Do you know who we are? Everyone knows who you are. One of your men has been going after people with a sledgehammer. What? Excuse me. Wait in my office and Inspector Fromentin will take your statement. Go on. You were saying? Inspector Gilles Lemaire went to Mr Ferro's home. He broke his door down with a sledgehammer. We would like to question him. - There must be some misunderstanding. Inspector Lemaire has been ill all day. Stomach upset. He's in the recovery room. Can he get up? - Of course. That way. Will you give me a minute? The heavies. Well done. Hide your gun. You've been in the loo, food poisoning. Come in. He was there five minutes ago. Do you know Ferro? - No. We do. He's an habitual offender, a compulsive liar. Here's Inspector Lemaire. These gentlemen would like a word. - Really? OK, I'll leave you to it. I'd like to make an appointment with Dr Chaumet. Get to the loo. - What? Get to the loo. It's kind of you to worry about my health. Will you sign my sick form? - We're looking for toxic substances. It's normal procedure. - I see. You don't look very clean. Is it normal procedure to watch me have a piss, too? Is it happening or not? - Yes, yes. So, you piss on demand, do you? From what you've told us, Mr Ferro sounds like a pain in the neck. We'll check him out. We'll let you know about the urine test. Goodbye, gentlemen. - Bye. Chief Inspector. I can't believe they fell for it. If we get caught, we're in trouble. Fill out a leave form. - What leave? Do you have any idea what's going on here? If they find any witnesses, make inquiries... Laure's risking everything to cover some little prat with coke coming out of his ears. The least you could do is say thank you. What's going on? Get up. - I've been let out. Get up. You're coming with me. Don't argue. Easy, easy... Don't get upset. You got your client's mother to testify against her son? So what? She was lying before. - That's madness. He'll be sleeping in a cell tonight. I don't understand. You wanted to punish him? I don't like to be insulted. You're just like him. I'm going to defend him so well, he will go down for twenty years. He's guilty of torture. That's a serious offence. You really are ruthless. Hi. Are you OK? - Yes. Did you keep the sketches I gave you? They're in the safe. - Get rid of them quickly. They're in Pierre's safe. He thinks I've lost the key. Did you tell him that? No. I told him it was him who lost it. I don't want him to have any grief. It's you who's got grief. Your father, too. I know who it was who denounced you, Marianne. What? It was the people Pierre was hounding in this Romanian case. He went after them. Now they want their revenge. Is he aware of this? Of course. They sent me to warn him. Why did they send you? I had no idea they would take it out on you and your father. When Pierre found out, did he just carry on? I received this letter. An anonymous letter. It contains information about the production of counterfeit drugs abroad. The manufacturing process was stolen by your father-in-law's firm. It's quite specific. It gives names. We've checked them out. It gives us a lead. It mentions you, too. Me? - Yes. It says you have a safe at the Dupuis-Mandel bank which contains evidence. If the rest was far-fetched, I wouldn't take any notice. I have to ask you about it. This safe, does it exist? - Yes, it exists. I never use it. It contains my great-grandmother's jewellery. We're going to have to open it. I haven't seen the key for about three years. Do we call a locksmith? Do you recognise the contents? - Yes, I think so. Right, make a note of what's in the envelope. There are sketches of the packaging of the counterfeit drugs found in the Villequier trucks. That's not possible. This is very embarrassing for you, Mr Deputy. Aiding and abetting and the possession of stolen goods. Excuse me, Judge, Mrs Cl?ment is here. Bring her in without warning her. So, you had the key? Well? You'll appear before me tomorrow morning at 10:00. 9:30 would be better, Judge. 9:30, perfect. Come to my chambers. I'll advise you on the date of your hearing. Your solicitor is welcome to join us. Perhaps I should put you in police custody so you don't run off like your father. My father didn't run off. I'll be there. That's all I ask of you. So, basically, you feel bad. Basically, yes. It's understandable. Doy you mind if I play the age card? Go ahead. I warn you, I'm going to sound ancient. That's what need. Right. There are three sorts of bad cases. Those that are bad those that very bad and those that are doomed. The Andrescu case is the third type. That's most reassuring. I've been tempted to tell you more than once to stop meddling. But we can't learn from the experience of others. But, now you know. Yes. Now I know. You're here, too? Is this a "congratulations, you're an idiot" party? We just thought you might like a bit of company. No? - You're going to stay here. What? Tintin's got enough kids at his place already. I've made a bed up for you. Just until you quit your bad habits. I brought some clothes. It's very kind of you, I appreciate your concern, but what's the idea? To stop me going out, you put me under house arrest? Just to stop you being alone. So you don't get tempted. Will you both watch over me or take it in turns? Francky will be here. - Francky? He will replace us when we can't be here. He's a nice guy. I helped him out big time a few years ago, so now he does what I ask, don't you? Am I allowed a beer at least? Of course. Francky, could you get a beer? You don't think we're doing this to piss you off, do you? OK, then, but I'm not wearing Tintin's clothes. Don't. I know it's your fault. What do you mean? Benoit warned you and you did nothing to stop this. Did he tell you that? That's not the problem. The problem is you live for your work. It's Benoit who denounced you to put pressure on me to halt my inquiries about Elina. Did he forget to tell you that? You let him do it. You didn't warn us. You don't give a shit about anybody. You only care about the law. At least Benoit helped us out when the firm went bankrupt. He helped you, all right! - Stop giving me a lesson in morality. A client went bankrupt leaving us millions short. Did you know? You were happy for Dad to buy the flat, the car. It was a good life, wasn't it? You never said. How was I meant to know? What would you have said? Told me to respect the law? The drug trafficking was my idea. Dad was scared. Now you know everything. Welcome to the real world. Forget me. Aline! - Yes? Aline, will you get it? - I'll go. You're up bright and early. What's up? Good morning. Inspector Fromentin, CID. I don't understand. We're taking you into police custody. to conduct a preliminary investigation into a case of procuring.
