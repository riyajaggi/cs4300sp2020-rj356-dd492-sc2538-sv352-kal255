 Previously... The autopsy showed sexual assault, so she's a whore from Eastern Europe. She was leaving your flat. - I don't understand. She was heading home, alive. He's mixed up in this. He's hiding something. It's me who's taking risks to cover your back here. Elina Andrescu's sister's body was found in cold storage. Rubbish. You know more than the police. I ask the questions. You're the nark. Admit that you did it! One of your men is threatening people with a sledgehammer.

 You're staying here. - What? Until you get clean. This case is doing your head in. Drop it. - I'm not dropping it. He won't give up. - Don't be weak. You're sacrificing everything. This is going to end in tears. You're up early. What's happened? Good morning. Inspector Fromentin, CID. I don't understand. Mr Faye, we're taking you in to conduct an investigation into procuring. What is this nonsense? You can get changed, but we will have to accompany you. Am I allowed to take a shower?

 You can ask him. It's the police who are taking you in. So, you're here as an extra? You may take a shower but I'll need to check the bathroom first. Are you going to handcuff me, too? Go ahead, if you need to. The bathroom is this way. SPIRAL Maybe your son has simply run away. Benjamin can't go out alone. He's handicapped. He has a mental age of five. He can't get around. His mother came to get him. In the middle of the night? He wasn't in his room when I woke up. That should give me my freedom. She can't resist ruining my life, like when we were married. Does your son live with her? - We have joint custody. Alternate weeks. This is my week. She had no right to take him. You didn't answer my question. Why would she do that? I had an important appointment. She knew that. I'm an auctioneer. I was going to take my son to the clinic before my appointment. It was all arranged. And? Did you miss your appointment? They cancelled at the last minute, which is why I can be here now. I want it to stop. There are limits. When the police go and get my son she will see that. Do you have a lot of money? I'm comfortably off. Why? Your son may have been abducted. Are you saying he has been kidnapped? It may not be your wife who took him. My ex-wife. I don't get it. There are much richer men than me. Are you protecting her? Is this female solidarity? Do you think all mothers are innocent by nature? Give me her address. Are you OK? - Great, yes. Do you want me to remind you why you're here? Stop sulking. I'm letting you out. Madeleine Surrier's address. Her ex-husband came to see me. He's accusing her of abducting their son. Bring them both in. Have I served my sentence? Yes. I would send Fromentin, but he's taking care of Faye. I can trust you, can't I? Don't break any doors down. - All right, all right! What if the child isn't with the mum? Bring her in anyway. We'll be needing her. Chief Inspector. Are you going to question me? You may be examined by a doctor if you wish. I'd prefer a solicitor. With procuring it takes longer to find a solicitor. About thirty-six hours. - Of course. So, when will I be questioned? The prosecutor is contacting experts in this field. It could take time. A shrewd move. Is this to humiliate me? You should question me. I'm so bored, I'd admit to anything. Take advantage. - So you don't want to see a doctor? That's correct. Say hello to my friend Pierre Cl?ment. I hope he's enjoying this at least. It's kind of you to call me. I haven't long, so listen. Benoit Faye is in custody, Cl?ment's orders. What for? He's accusing him of procuring. - What nonsense! Will Faye hold out? What do I care? OK. Here. It's over. - Something else, then? You have your information, now leave! OK. As you wish. But don't forget what you owe me. I took over your debts. That's not free. I'll pay you back. - 50,000 euros. What do you take me for? If you don't pay me back, I'll have to ask your girlfriend Alyssa. It won't be easy for her. Here. This one is on me. Let me know when Faye is released. Warn me first. Then, we'll see about you paying me back. Do you know where your son is? How could I know? Your ex says you abducted him. He got rid of him. Listen, domestics have no place in the law courts. Don't involve the justice system in your quarrels with him. I know he killed him. He killed Benjamin and disposed of the body. That is a very serious accusation. Do you have any evidence? Ever since our divorce, I've known he intended to get rid of him. I can't prove it but I am sure of it. He killed my firstborn, too. You're accusing him of another murder? I was pregnant before. He made me abort when he found out it was a girl. After five months. It was disgusting. The second time I was terrified it would be another girl. I was so scared. I didn't want to get pregnant. But you had a boy. - Yes. But handicapped. He was so ashamed of him. It drove him mad. We stopped seeing people and everything was my fault. But he asked for joint custody. That proves he cared about his son. - He wanted to control me. He used Benjamin to humiliate me. He was paying for his treatment, his school, the nurses. He said I was incapable of looking after him. So he killed him over money? He killed him... because it was the only way left of getting back at me. She said that? That's incredible. That exceeds all my expectations. I knew she wouldn't disappoint you, but she's excelled herself. Are you amused by this? - You're wrong. I'm not amused. Benjamin wasn't with her. He must be elsewhere. She maintains you killed him. Why would I kill him? I've got no reason to. She has many. What do you mean? She saw Benjamin as a burden because of his handicap. Even more so now she intends to go back to work, start a new career. And Benjamin isn't a burden for you? Benjamin means a lot to me. He's a sensitive, affectionate boy. - It's still quite a responsibility. That doesn't bother me. I earn enough to see to his needs. Your ex-wife said you made her have an abortion. What has that got to do with it? - You wanted a son. No, I didn't want a daughter. Madeleine is Jewish. Didn't you know? That's why I let her keep my name because her maiden name... If I'd had a girl, my grandchildren would be Jewish. The religion dictates that. That's why I didn't want a girl. What's wrong with Jews? - Nothing at all. But I'm not Jewish and I don't want Jewish grandchildren. We will do everything we can. - Sorry? To find your son. Oh, yes, of course. I mean, I hope so. Look. My wife is waiting for me. I'll be in touch. You're here? Abducted by strangers? I don't think so. Me, neither, but you never know. Strange couple. He's a famous auctioneer. He handles all the major furniture sales. So he knows how to recognise a Louis XIII bidet? Very impressive. Why so aggressive? You're using your position to get even with Faye. He is implicated in a murder case. If that's why you brought him in, why didn't you do it sooner? He knows something. Being in custody might make him talk. This is punishment for taking you and your wife's family on. Not very professional, Mr Public Prosecutor. Have you had time to read my file? I found it fascinating. - Don't laugh at me. Really, for a legal aid case, it's brilliant. What's your client's name? Marc... something or other. Marc Flatrian. - You seem interested. Several weeks or months ago, this Marc Flatrian had an affair with a girl called Nathalie. Have you forgotten her surname too? - Karam. Reunited after a break-up, they spend the evening together - not a smart move. And two days later she accuses him of rape. You're good. Want to be my pupil? - You're too kind. First question. Did they have sex? Yes. No one's disputing that. Second question. Did he rape her? - She says he did. He says she consented to sex. It's amazing. Have you noticed? It's exactly what happened to me. We sleep together. I leave her, go back to her. She cries rape. I deny it. It's just like Mr Flatrian. Only I was convicted. Flatrian... have you seen him? He's in police custody. - Do you believe him when he says he didn't rape her? That's not the point. - It is. It's the whole point. Do you believe him? To be honest with you, I don't know. - He's in trouble, then. He's had it, if you want my opinion. Mr Faye, you're being investigated for procuring. So I understand. The police investigation following the murder of Elina Andrescu, which is ongoing, has revealed that every month you gave her cash which she used to pay her rent. Is that right? Why cash? Because I don't like cheques. Where did the cash come from? - Where do you think? I'm asking you, Mr Faye. From my bank account. Sometimes from gaming tables when I was on a winning streak, which was rare. So this money didn't belong to Miss Andrescu? Don't you understand? It was money that I gave her. But Miss Andrescu was a prostitute. - You're wrong. Elina was a researcher in biology. She was my lover and friend. I paid her rent out of friendship. We have reason to believe you financed the premises she worked from. According to the law, that constitutes procuring. I must be the only procurer who ends up out of pocket. That's a two-way mirror, I suppose. I've no idea. It's not my police station. I think I know who's standing behind it. You're lucky. You know more than I do. According to your file, you are in contact with one of your Romanian colleagues, Michel. Colleague? - Procurer. My colleagues are businessmen or bankers. Of course they are. Do you recognise him? I'm not answering any more questions. Well, I'll carry on asking them. How much would you say you gave Miss Andrescu each month? We'll grill him and then let him go. Mr Flatrian, I know this is awkward but you're going to have to help me. I didn't rape her. She wanted it. I dumped her and she insisted I saw her again, so I did. Got a cigarette? - No. Why did you end it? Like I said, I was sick of her being so clingy. I told her it was over and she wouldn't let me go. Do you have any witnesses, any messages? A phone bill? Can you prove it? Yes. She was always following me. She phoned me all the time. She wrote me letters. My mother has them. You have letters? - Yes. Do you want to see them? I've put Nathalie Karam's letters into two categories according to how upset or threatening she was being. She's enlightening, especially when she's upset. She's sorry it's over. She gives an account of the extremely deep feelings your client inspired in her. Would you like to hear an extract? - No. There's no need. The sexual side of things is disturbing. Since he obviously never replies, never even opens the letters, she threatens him. She talks of revenge. She even says she knows how to go about it. Is that in black and white? - Yes. She's done for. It's a shame Elise never sent me letters like this. Why? Do they turn you on? - It's not that. I could have used them in my trial. I wouldn't have been convicted. I'd still be a solicitor. Do you miss your career? Then again, I wouldn't have met you. - Stop flirting. I don't like rapists. Do you believe your client now? He walked into a trap. He walked into a trap. You're free to go. Do you know what that means? My file is empty. There's nothing in it. Can't you stop fighting with your friend? Tell us what you know about Sofia and Elina's deaths. Sofia Andrescu committed suicide. Elina Andrescu was murdered. That's all I know. Their deaths are unrelated. Act dumb, then. It was the same people both times. I think you know them. First murder, then suicide. They're good. How do they do it? - This is how they do it. That's your girlfriend, Elina. Nice work, eh? Tell me what you know. I know nothing. Are you scared? Why would I be scared? - They killed two girls. You're scared it might be you next. Or someone else. But what would you care, as long as you're safe? You're not a nice man. We're letting Faye go. - I don't get him. Who? - Cl?ment, your deputy. Is he still your deputy? Things move so fast with you. Will you stop bullying me? Was it your idea? - No, it was his idea. Then, just when Faye thinks he's safe, bam! A court hearing. Not bad. - It's a police tactic. A neighbour saw Surrier take his car out in the night. Alone? - So the neighbours say. Maybe the kid was in the boot. I have a statement. Bring Surrier in. - He's already here. Thanks for thinking of it. My informer called. They're letting him go. He called you? You have your little piggy well trained. If they're letting him go, we can relax. It's a tactic to make him talk. Do you think it will work? - There's a fifty-fifty chance. As much as that? We can't trust him. Get rid of him. How? However you like. Get him killed. Kill him yourself. Make it look like a contract killing. They will think he was involved in a shady deal. It's perfect. We get rid of him and discredit him at the same time. It's going to cost. Yes, I lied. I lied. I realised Benjamin was missing at about 1.30am or 2:00am. I thought he might be in the area. I went looking for him. - By car? I stood a better chance of catching him up. When you didn't find him you went home to bed. I told you, I thought Madeleine had come to get him. I know I'm not very likeable. Next to a tearful mother, I look guilty as sin. I know what my wife has told you. I know her reproaches by heart. But I've done a lot for her out of love. Do you know what? Madeleine was always complaining sex was too quick... and I didn't pay her enough attention. You don't know her. She goes round in circles, makes a big deal of things and goes on and on. I got myself circumcised. It delays ejaculation. Did you know that? I did it for her. I thought, too, she would feel more at home with it. Wait. I'll show you. Very amusing, your little film. He's right. He looks guilty as sin. Was there nothing in the car? Nothing to suggest a child had been shut in the boot. Hairs on the seat, but that's to be expected. So we know he left home to look for his son, he says, and his wife is accusing him. That's not enough. They're doomed as a couple. They can't be together without hurting each other. They're not the only ones. I tell you what, let's ask his wife to record him. You say she saw him and they touched. It's of no judicial value but it means more to me. So we know what to look for. Why? Why here, in a hotel? What have you done with him? - You don't want to know. I do. Tell me. I need to know. Do you want me to have killed him? - How did you kill him? With a knife? No. There would have been blood everywhere. Did you strangle him? He was sleeping. I gave him some pills. He didn't struggle. I put a cushion over his face. I pressed down hard. I had to be sure. And his body? What have you done with it? It's what you wanted. Don't talk about it. Forget it. He's gone, disappeared. The only thing that matters now is us. Benoit, it's Michel. Are you alone? You're not expecting anyone? Good. I'm coming to see you. You wanted to see me, too? Very good. Great minds think alike. See you in a bit. I didn't hear her come in. I didn't hear her come in. So it was Michel who wanted to kill you. He's not my friend. Whatever. Why did he want to kill you? You won't say. You have to help me because your Michel has disappeared. He's hiding. He's a murderer. He's checked out of his hotel. He's taken the hire car back. He's changed his phone number. Do you warn him every time? You'll have to go after him. Thanks for your advice. Let me give you some now. It's in your interest to tell me everything in detail. I can't as long as Michel is at large. Once we've caught him will you tell us everything? There's not much risk of that. You know he'll be miles away by now. I'm not interested in you any more. I've no idea what you're mixed up in. You're involved in stuff that is beyond me. Here's what happens now. An examining judge will be appointed. He will ask for you to be put in police custody. My involvement ends here. Why the reconstruction? Doesn't the judge believe me? Those threatening letters you sent Mr Flatrian aren't helping your case. You can trust Judge Roban. He's a good magistrate. If your version of events is coherent, you will be fine. It's nice here. - Do you think so? I love reconstructions. It gets us out in the fresh air. Are they coming? - They just called. They're on their way. The hero of the day is making us wait. Spit out your chewing gum. Relax. It will be fine. You say you kissed in this hall. Show us where you kissed. There. - Go on. What happened next? I said I wanted to go up alone. I wanted it to stop there. You must be joking! She didn't want it to stop. Carry on, Miss Karam. He kissed me again and made me go in there. And you let him? You didn't shout out? You didn't struggle? Why is he picking on me? I've told him... I'm not picking on you. I'm just trying to piece together what happened. Let's move on. Can you get me the dummy? Once we were inside, he pinned me against the machine and put his hand over my mouth. Then, he raped me. - In what position exactly? Standing? He pushed me against the machine and did it from behind. What were you wearing that evening? Trousers? A dress? - I had my green dress on. So while Mr Flatrian was pinning you against the wall with a hand over your mouth, he took off your knickers slammed the door and penetrated you, all at the same time. Not at the same time. I don't know any more. She's lying. I would need four hands to do that. Thank you, Miss Karam. It's your turn now. First, I held her like that. Then, I kissed her. Go ahead. Do it. What then? - She told me to lie down. So I lay down. - Where exactly? There, at the back. Was all this stuff here when you came in here with Miss Karam? Yes. - OK. Lie down. What next? She sat on me. Carry on. - She rubbed herself against me. She took my cock out. The reconstruction is not acceptable. Police antics are upsetting my client. Your client doesn't seem to be upset in the slightest. So you claim it was in this position that you made love. She looked me in the eyes and told me she was crazy about me. Is that when she slammed the door? - The door? You said while she was on top of you, she slammed the door with one hand. That can't be right. I don't know who shut the door. Wait a minute - in your statement and I quote, "She was yelling so much, she shut the door so no one would hear." So what? Maybe she was near the door. You just said that all this stuff was there. You're confusing me. Ask my solicitor. Detective Inspector, you can put that away now. The reconstruction is over. - What do you mean "over"? I believe your client to be lying and Miss Karam to be telling the truth. She trapped me. She led me on. She's a prick-tease. Don't touch me. - Come here. Did you have to mess about there? - We were having a laugh. That poor girl was in a state. - Do you prefer it when Gilou sulks? I didn't say that. - Well, then. It's good to see him feeling better. Skilfully done. I couldn't understand why you were laying into that girl. You gave my client a chance to relax and lower his guard. Not at all. My reconstruction was impartial. Of course it was. Goodbye, Miss Karlsson. Do you mind if I walk back with you? - Not at all. Tell me, what do you make of the Surrier case? Do you see a motive for murder? No. - Me, neither. If it was murder, and we don't know that yet... A child has disappeared. The public will get upset. They want action. Will you take the father in? I've asked for him to be remanded in custody. I have a bad feeling about the mother. She hasn't admitted to anything. What? Did I say something funny? You're always quick to suspect women. - Really? I find you a little misogynistic. Do you have a problem with women? Why? Don't you? I hope I get to see my son again one day. Did you have any trouble finding us? - No, I didn't. We've converted the room downstairs. It's easier. She prefers to be in the garden more and more. Try not to tire her out too much. Thank you. Good afternoon. Forgive me. - Please don't get up. Do sit down. Did he send you? Vincent? No. Mr Leroy doesn't know I'm here. You said you were a colleague of his, so I thought... I've tried phoning him dozens of times. When I got through to him he hung up as soon as he heard my voice. Does he know you're ill? I wrote. He didn't reply. Has he told you about it? No. I'm going to die soon. You can probably tell. Do you want to see him again? - There would be no point. I want... I want to review the case. I lied. It's a trivial story. I was young. He was my boss and I was in love with him. He left you and to get your revenge, you set him up. I slept with him so I could accuse him of rape. I fell pregnant. So stupid. Is that his son? Does Mr Leroy know this? I said nothing as I didn't want it to weaken my case in the trial. I couldn't accuse him of rape and choose to keep the baby. And the rest is history. I did it to make him see how much I loved him. I wanted him to react. And he said nothing. He accepted his conviction. That was stupid of him. I let it happen. Will you help me? Wow! You're really going for it tonight. You can talk. Wait. Let me get changed. You look beautiful. What have you done? Come back! Help! We're closed. Open up! Quick! - Stop banging on the window. My boyfriend has taken an overdose. Open up! Call the emergency services. - I already have! He needs a shot of adrenalin. You've got that! Wait a moment. But I don't know what to do. Wait. He hasn't got a pulse. I think he's dead. Give him the shot. - That's it. Thanks. Get a move on. - Don't panic. If you panic, I'll get this wrong. No. I can't do it. He's dead. - Give it here. He's about to come to... We've just given him an injection. Let's go. Let me explain how we should proceed. I've written up everything you told me. You're going to read it and sign it. - Yes. Finally, I'm going to record your testimony. I'm going to film it. Will you be able to review the case? You will have to give me all the paperwork you have. It's all ready. - Good. What are you doing? We're going to film Mummy. R?my? Can you leave us alone? Come on. Leave Mummy alone. Right. Ready? Where do I start? Wherever you like. It's hard. You have to get me out of here. Help me. I'm begging you. You have to talk first. Elina was killed because she tried to find out about her sister. Who killed her? Michel, I think. I'm not sure. Sofia committed suicide. So what if Elina knew that? She killed herself because of what she had suffered. What did she suffer? OK. We know most of it from the autopsy. Who did that to her? Who? Laborde. Laborde? First, it's Michel who has vanished. Now, it's Laborde who is untouchable. So Laborde knew Sofia? Don't you believe me? I have my doubts. Carry on. I sense there's more. I'm listening. I bought you some sweets. It's better than coke. Not as good as sex, obviously. There's not much on offer here. Is there a nurse looking after you? It's cool they let you out. - You're here to keep a close watch. I didn't realise it had got so bad. I'm ashamed of myself, honestly. I'm so ashamed. You're alive. You're going to be OK. I'm such a waster. A total waster. Stop it, Gilou. We'll help you. If you want to help me, look after Alyssa. Michel cornered me. May I? Sit down. - Thanks. The Romanian killed the girl. What makes you think that? - I can't tell you. It's him who tried to kill Benoit. That's what Benoit told me, too. I don't know what to believe any more. Do you want him to stay in prison? It's not that. He begged me to get him out. You know he didn't kill Elina. Do you know what prison is like? Even Roban, who's hardly lax, knows when to let go. He has nightmares about getting it wrong. You're right. I'm going to get him out.
