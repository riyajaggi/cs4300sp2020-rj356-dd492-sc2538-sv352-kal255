 _ _ Hello, Emma. Previously on Scream... We have a pervert watching me undress on my webcam. Your mom had a baby with Brandon James? Mr. Branson has to be the killer. I drove her home. And then she was murdered. And I showed her his picture, Cassie pointed out Kieran. He is the only person who would've wanted her gone.

 Mom? What's going on? Seth Branson escaped. - There's an officer dead on the scene. - Oh, my God. They think the crime scene looks staged. - Stay here, okay? - Mom, I'm coming with you. No. You stay here, okay? You're safer here with all these deputies. Emma, is your mom okay? No, she's definitely not okay. Why would Mr. Branson do this? Maybe to get the police distracted looking for the Sheriff instead of looking for him. I'm gonna go to the station and see what I can find out. Be careful. And don't trust anyone.

 Kieran, leave a message. Kieran, uh, look, I don't know if you know, but Branson escaped, and your dad's in trouble. Look, I don't know what to believe. Just please call me back, okay? Noah... I just heard that Branson's... Yeah, I heard. One of those rare moments where I hate being right. We have to find the Sheriff. I think I can help with that. Whoever hacked the big screen is sending a live signal through my AV system. - Can you trace it? - I'm working on it. - Hey, have you heard from Brooke? - No. 'Cause I can't reach Audrey. They may not even know what's going on. Oh, no. Where the hell are my actual friends? She's not answering. _ - Why isn't she answering her texts? - _ _ Hello? Hello, Emma. Enjoying the dance? Let him go, okay? This is about you and me. Oh, I don't think so. Tonight's the big finale, Emma. Gotta make sure everybody's watching the horror show. People wanna see blood, and I'm gonna give it to 'em. I'm gonna find him. And then I'm gonna find you, you sick son of a bitch. Then let's see what you've learned, Emma. Can you put all the pieces together in time to save him? Or will Daisy's heart be broken the way she broke Brandon's? It's up to you. But I can promise you one thing, it's gonna be gut-wrenching. Scream - S01E10 - Season Finale Revelations sync and correction by solfieri - www.addic7ed.com The killer called. He said that tonight's the big finale. Of course he did. A big ill-advised Halloween dance. We have to find the Sheriff. I'm trying, but all my serious gear is back at the shop. - Okay, well, let's go. Now. - Yeah. Sorry, guys, nobody leaves. We need to go to the station now or the Sheriff is going to die. I'd listen to her. You can take him down. Mom! Mom! Emma, I told you to stay at the dance. Mom, the killer just called. He said unless I put the pieces together fast he's gonna break Daisy's heart. Oh, my God. He's gonna kill Clark. No, not if we can find what he wants. You said that the deputy's body looks staged, right? When he took Will, he carved a clue onto his back. Wait. I need to see him. There's something in his mouth. Oh, my God. What is that? Oh, God. Brandon made it for me. He used to leave me gifts in the tree behind my house. Mom... what if that's where Clark is? Ugh, God! Oh, man, Brooke, you should've seen your face. You were like... God! It was priceless. Grayson, you are such a tool. Where did you get that? Uh, some sick chick on Etsy. She jacked up the price for Halloween, but it was so worth it! Well, now it's mine, so... Audrey? Hey. Did not expect to see you here. That makes two of us. Nice mask. Big plans later? It's tempting. I mean, some psycho wears this to kill our friends, and people treat it like it's a joke. That's because people generally suck. I know. Even the ones I like. Emma bailed on me, Jake spied on me and everyone else, well, they're gone, so... Looks like you're officially my favorite person at this party. So not exactly a banner day in the Maddox household. Nope. So, uh, what brings you to my pity party? I found something that looks like Emma might be sleeping with the enemy, but she didn't want to hear it. And I didn't want to see it. No. Kieran can't be the killer. He's too pretty. Although I guess Ted Bundy kinda proved that hotness doesn't cancel out crazy. True. I just don't wanna see her get hurt. I know. You're just looking out for her. It's what friends do. Or, at least, they should do. You know, I kind of like this whole real human thing you got going right now. Are you flirting with me? Oh, you wish. Hey, look at us bonding. Chicks before dicks. Oh, let's not get crazy. Oh, snap. Just in time for the hot girl-on-girl action. Speaking of dicks... Jake, I don't remember inviting you to the party. Oh, come on, Brooke. I think The Jake is the party. Can I get an "amen"? Amen! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Mom! Oh, my God. Over here! Okay. Clark. Clark, it's Maggie. Untie him! Can you hear me? It's okay. We're here. We got you. It's okay. Okay? Sorry I missed the dance. Don't you worry. You're gonna be taking me to a lot of dances, okay? Shh. - Give me those. - Maggie. Okay, hold on, honey. Hold on. Maggie... - It's all right. I got you. - Maggie, something's not right. - Maggie... - It's okay. It's okay. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! No, no, no! No, no... Get help! Stay with me! Stay with me! Oh, God, please stay with me. No... Mom, I'm so sorry. I did this. I should've checked him more carefully. Maybe I could've stabilized him. Mom, the EMT said that there was nothing that you could've done. The bastard just kept him alive so he could watch me try to save him. I know. And then he had me kill him. I know. Just like Will. Mom, we can't let him win. No, we can't. You need to tell Kieran. He can't find out about this on the news. Okay. I'll find him. And then I'll find the psycho who did this. No, you won't. We're ready to move him. Okay. I'm gonna go with Clark. I'm gonna have a deputy take you to the station. You wait right over there for him. Hey, I'll see you there. Okay. Emma. - Piper, I can't talk right now. - No, I don't want you to. I mean, after what you just saw... Anything you need, I wanna help. I have to go to the station with my mom. I can't reach Brooke. A deputy went to her party, but I haven't heard anything. I'll go check, okay? You don't worry. Thank you. Be careful. You, too. First he spies on me, then he shows up with her. Men are pigs. True. She's literally dumb as toast. Brooke, it's obvious he has nothing for her except the rise it gets out of you. Yeah, well, I've been known to make things rise myself. Hey, Board Shorts! How would you like to share one of the finest wines out of Bordeaux in the last half-century? Yeah, sure. Go do some push-ups. Well played. Thank you. Do me a solid? Do not let the unwashed masses into this house. Aye, aye, captain. Hold that thought. I'll be right back. Hey. Hold up. Where do you think you're going? I gotta hit the head. You're soaking wet. Hit the head in the pool house. Whatever, bitch. Um, we have to stay here to help with the search, okay? Mom, is there anything I can do for you? No... I'm okay. I'm gonna, um, go get cleaned up. I'll be back. Noah? Well, I've almost isolated the signal. And I figured out why we can't reach people. The malware doesn't just access webcams. It turns off ringers and notifications. So they don't even know that we've been trying to contact them. Oh, my God. He's cutting us off from everyone. Yeah, pretty much. Oh, yes. I got it! It's 1221 Sparrow Drive? That's Brooke's house. Wait, Audrey and Jake are there, and I... I just sent Piper over there to check on them. Tell the cops we've got him. _ Emma? Emma, do you hear me? Noah, pick me up at the Sheriff's station right now. This is insane. We are willingly driving alone into certain danger without a police escort. The cops can't help us. Really? Because I'm pretty sure they've got, like, big-ass guns and body armor and SWAT Teams. - This is America. - Noah, he said no cops, okay? We have to finish this ourselves. Okay. Well, if this is the final showdown, the killer's gonna try and take out every single one of your friends, one by one until you're the only one that's left. Because you're the survivor girl, which makes me the know-it-all sidekick. Oh, crap. I'm gonna die. You're not going to die! Tonight, we change the ending. Damn it, Jake. Shouldn't you be outside macking on your low-rent Olsen sister? Look, I don't wanna fight. I get jealous and I say stupid things. So I am sorry for what I said about you and your family. Okay. Well, then I'm sorry I accused you of spying on me. Full disclosure, I kinda was. See, I knew it! I was looking out for you. You mean looking out for my boobs? No, the spyware was deleted and then somebody put it back up. I was just trying to figure out who. Okay, then, why not just tell me that, Jake? Because I'm a jackass. And maybe I wanted to see your boobs. I'm sure you've seen plenty. Get out! Fine. Have you seen Jake? That's a no. Jake, are you in there? Oh, my God. Wait. Where you going? What are you waiting for? What the... Audrey? Jake? Board Shorts? Oh, my God. They ditched me. I have officially hit rock bottom. Brooke! It's me. Seth? How did you... What are you doing here? I was set up. Look, he was wearing a mask, and he killed the guard and he let me out. I knew how that was gonna look, so I ran. You have to believe me. Who set you up? I don't know. I didn't have anywhere else to go. Will you just please let me in? Where did everyone go? I don't know! Just listen to me, okay? Brooke, this whole thing... This whole thing is a mistake, okay? The night that you came to the theater, I was so, so damn happy to see you. I miss you. I miss what we've had. But whatever they say about me, you have to know that I would never hurt you. I don't even know who you are. Yes, you do. All that stuff that happened before, that has nothing to do with us. Look, what we had was special. Brooke, you're special to me. I wanna believe that, but I don't. Brooke, why won't you let me in? Seth? Oh, no. No! No, let me out! No, please. Let me out. Let me out! No. No! No! Let me out! Somebody help me! Are you sure this is where the signal's coming from? I'm pretty sure. Emma... Oh, my God! It's Piper. I'm gonna throw up. Come on, let's check the house. Emma, it's me. Relax. Holding a gun. Just breathe. Why didn't you call me back? Well, I didn't feel much like talking after you accused me of murder. You wanna put that down now? No, we don't actually want to. What are you doing here? You texted me to meet you. No, I didn't. Well, I didn't send this to myself. _ Unless you did. To convince you he's trustworthy because he's the one controlling the malware. What happened to Piper? I... I don't know. I just got here. I saw her car and I took a look around. I really wanna believe you. Why would I hurt Piper? Because she found out that you might be the son of Brandon James. What? Yeah, what? We talked to Cassie James. She said that her grandson came to visit her and she identified you. And you believe her? I don't know what to believe. Well, where were you all night? I drove out to the woods to be alone. I did a little target practice, I got your text, and I came here. As for Brandon James, when my dad became my guardian again, there was a lot of paperwork. You can see it all for yourself, it's at home. We may not be close, but I'm pretty sure he's the only dad I got. Oh, my God. You haven't heard? Heard what? Oh, man. What? Kieran... ...your dad was attacked. He didn't make it. I'm so sorry. We think he must have found something and then... And then, the killer found him. My mom tried to save him, but it was too late. I can't believe this. And you still think that this psychopath could be me? Take this and use it if you don't trust me. Or help me find this sick bastard before he hurts anyone else. Sounds fair to me. Let's go find everybody else. Brooke? Jake? Audrey! Bubblegum pop has never sounded so terrifying. Come on, this place is huge. Noah, take the back porch. Scream if you see anything. That won't be hard. Here, take this. Okay. But in observation of this loaded moment, I am not in favor of splitting up, nor am I three days from retiring. I will not be right back! Oh, no. Audrey. Somebody help me! Oh, my God. Is that Piper's handprint? I don't know. Hey! Yo! Yo! Unnecessary! Calm down. Jake, what the hell happened? I don't know. Me and Brooke got into a thing in the wine cellar, and then I went and took a walk by the lake and when I came back, nobody was here. I can't find her anywhere. What's that sound? Let me out! I think it's coming from the garage. Let's check the workshop! Oh, the freezer! Brooke! Oh, my God! - Brooke! Can you hear me? - We need to open this now! - Okay. Heads up! - Brooke! - Hey. - Hey! Brooke. Brooke, say something. Oh, my God. She's so cold. - We have to warm her up. - Oh, I got it. Jake! I'm still breathing, you creep! CPR's always a good idea. Brooke, what happened? Branson was here. He just... He just showed up, and I came here to hide. Oh, God, I hate this freezer. We have to find Audrey. Let's go. It's okay, Emma, go. It's okay. - Go. - Jake, stay here. I'm here. I'll keep you safe. I'm here. Audrey! Oh, man. Maybe someone just spilled their wine. Their thick, viscous red wine. Noah. Noah? It's okay, I'm fine. - I'm fine, too. - Oh, my God. What happened? I almost brained her is what happened. The killer was here. He killed Grayson and then he came after me. - How are you even alive? - I have no idea. I saw the mask and then everything went black. You and Brooke are lucky to be alive. Leaving survivors is not exactly this guy's M.O. I don't know. You survived. Twice. Yeah, being a hero. God, can someone please call a doctor so I survive? Cell phones are still out. There's a land line in the kitchen. A land line? What is this, 1996? Okay, you guys keep watch. I'm gonna go call my mom and try and get help. All right, I'm gonna get a first aid kit. You know how to use that, right? Uh... Yeah, yeah, totally. I got it. Are you calling to gloat? Not at all. You finally got a win. Just cut to the chase, okay? This is the big finale, right? So, here I am. Come and get me. Small catch, Emma. It's not just you that I want. - What? - Yes. I told you it started with Daisy, but it ends with you! Can't have one without the other. Oh, my God. Where is she? You're a smart girl, Emma. Figure it out. Where it ended for Brandon James. The dock at Wren Lake. Just you, Emma, or others will die! Mom! Mom! Oh, my God! Are you okay? - You shouldn't have come! - Are you okay? No, I shouldn't have left you. I am so sorry. Emma, he's here. No, don't! I'm here. Just like you wanted. No more games. No more masks. Hey, sis. Surprise. Piper? I seriously wish that you could see your face right now. Hashtag, mind blown. No, you can't be. I can. So when we were bonding about your dad being murdered, you were talking about Brandon James. Yes. And you were so easily convinced that it had to be his son that was swinging the knife, but it's 2015, Emma. Sexist much? You pretended to help me. You pretended to be my friend. And it stings when someone breaks your trust. Right, Mom? My dad trusted you and look how that turned out. Dad got shot, I got tossed, and Emma got the perfect life. Piper, I swear to you, I never meant for Brandon to get hurt. I was trying to protect him. You were trying to protect yourself! For 20 years, you have let everyone think that my dad was the monster, but you were the monster. You're right. But they were my mistakes, not Emma's. If you wanna hurt someone, hurt me! I plan on it. But I have kind of put a lot of thought and time into this, so I'd like to savor the moment a little bit before I slice you open, okay? I get it. I get it! You hate us! But why did you kill my friends? They had nothing to do with this! To watch you suffer, Emma. Although they did help a lot. After all, what did your BFFs do? They filmed your first time. I mean, the day that your video accidentally went viral and I was right there to see it happen? Priceless. They're gonna figure out who did this. No, they won't. Because the bad guy did it. And I have him back there, tied up in my trunk. You framed Branson. Do you know one benefit of stripping off masks is sometimes you find the perfect fall guy. Do you wanna know how his story ends? Branson slits Emma's throat in front of Mom before spilling Mom's guts. But not before Emma gets a good stabbing with the knife that she has hidden behind her back. Yeah. Fingerprints, sis. Rookie move. So then I'm gonna stumble out of the bloodbath and I'm gonna broadcast to the world that the Lakewood Slasher is dead. You're right. She will be! No! You're so predictable! So now, Mommy dearest, you're gonna get to watch her die. But I want you to know, sis, that when it's her turn, I'm gonna let her bleed out alone, the way that she left me. No! No! You broke my heart, Mom. Please stop. You always hurt the ones you love. No! You psychotic bitch! No, please. So, I have one more surprise for you before I open you up. And you'll never see it coming... Audrey. Oh, my God, Audrey. Oh, my God. Thank you. - Bitch talks too much. - Mom! - Emma... - Mom, are you okay? Nice shot. They always come back. Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom. I'm so sorry. We made it. We did. It's over. I love you. I love you, too. See you there. They found Branson in the back of Piper's trunk. He's gonna be fine. I'm just glad he's okay. Do you want me to go check on him? No. I'm good here with you. Told you that gun might come in handy. I'm so sorry. About doubting you, about your dad... - Everything. - I know. Is there any way that we can get past this? I think so. I'm gonna ride with my mom. Okay. I'll meet you there. You got your classic showdown at the lake, tying together the past and present. And Survivor Girl in the back of an ambulance, just like somebody predicted. Exactly! Except today, we're all sitting in the back of the ambulance together. Well, not literally, 'cause then we wouldn't all fit, but you know what I mean. I do. I'm just glad I saw Em run into the woods. I almost lost her. You were a genuine crime-fighting hero tonight, Bi-Curious. Right back at you, Virgin. Mmm. - Are you okay? - Not really. Yeah, we gotta get you to the hospital. Hey, guys, this is Noah Foster, local student and survivor of the Lakewood Slasher murders, guest podcasting the final chapter of Autopsy of a Crime for your former host, the now-deceased criminal mastermind behind the killings, Piper Shaw. So having made it to the end of our very own slasher movie, I think we're all just processing what we've lost and how to move on. Staring death in the face has a way of making you want to be a little more forgiving. Hey. Maybe we'll find that the loss of someone we loved may lead to the promise of someone new. Maybe we'll see this as a second chance to do things differently and make a change for the good. Or to wipe the slate clean and re-invent ourselves as someone new. At the end of the day, we're all just grateful that it's over and that the Lakewood Slasher is dead, but there's still one thing I can't figure out. Piper Shaw confessed to her crimes in classic villain fashion, but she didn't explain who attacked her and Will Belmont in that abandoned building. I mean, sure, she could've banged herself on the head and made up the story, but Will confirmed it later. _ Much as I love a good Hollywood ending, I can't help but wonder, who was wearing the mask that night? Am I just overthinking it? Or is there more to come? More. More. More. *** Is coming next year. Oh, crap. I'm gonna die. Scream returns with the killing new season in 2016.
