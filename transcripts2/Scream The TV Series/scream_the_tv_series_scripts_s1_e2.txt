  Woman: Previously on scream...
  You can't do a slasher movie as a tv series.
  Slasher movies burn bright and fast.
  Nina, are you home?
  Noah: By the time the first body's found...
  (screaming)
  ...It's only a matter of time before the bloodbath commences.
  We're looking for miss patterson's ex-boyfriend, tyler o'neill.
  Maybe brandon james is back.
  Who's brandon james?
  He killed a bunch of students 20 years ago.
  You need to forget it's a horror story.
  You have to care if the hot lit teacher
  Seems a little too interested in his female students.
  I feel ugly.
  Audrey: You are beautiful.
  Noah: You have to care if the smart, pretty girl
  Forgives the dumb jock.
  You slept with nina.
  Noah: You root for them. You love them.
  So when they are brutally murdered...
  (gasps)
  ...It hurts.
  Everyone has secrets.
  Everyone tells lies.
  And everyone is fair game
  Until there's no one left.
  -(cell phone ringing) -(gasps)
  Hey. Did you get home okay?
  Audrey: (voice distorted) yeah, how are you doing?
  Uh, your voice sounds kind of weird.
  Must be a bad connection.
  How about now?
  Not really, but it's okay.
  I've been thinking about you all night.
  Must be a crap tv night.
  Why do you do that? Put yourself down?
  It's not just me.
  -Have you been online? -Ignore them.
  Yeah, you don't go to a bitch-infested catholic school.
  There's a bitch infestation at my school too, trust me.
  So, do you want some company?
  No. It's late.
  What if i'm already here?
  -(thudding) -what was that?
  Audrey, that's not funny.
  My mom is gonna be home soon.
  Okay, if this is a coming out of the closet joke,
  It needs to be significantly less creepy.
  Go ahead. Take a look.
  (sighs)
  Okay. You got me.
  -Where are you? -(rattling)
  (door creaking)
  Audrey, you're scaring me.
  Just playing.
  Come out to our spot.
  It's a beautiful night.
  Audrey?
  Audrey, you're not out here.
  Romeo, you are certifiable.
  What can i say?
  You make me crazy.
  Audrey, where are you?
  (screaming)
  Piper: For aqr web radio,
  Welcome to autopsy of a crime.
  This is piper shaw
  Podcasting the murder investigation of nina patterson,
  Day-by-day as it unfolds.
  So, it's been four days since this brutal slaying
  And local sheriff clark hudson
  Is still looking for nina's ex-boyfriend, tyler o'neill,
  As a person of interest.
  With this town's blood-soaked history,
  Echoes of lakewood's homegrown psycho, brandon james,
  Are everywhere.
  Walking the streets, you can hear terrified locals
  Wondering, could he be back?
  Emma!
  Hey!
  You could answer one of my texts.
  I know you're getting them.
  They say, "read."
  -Hi, riley. -(sighs)
  What're you listening to?
  Uh, that true crime podcast.
  They're covering nina's murder.
  Aoc? I'm addicted.
  They have, like, a crazy huge following.
  I can't believe that chick's here talking about our nina.
  Oh, nina, always loved to be the center of attention.
  Yeah, apparently, even with will.
  Emma, wait. Look, i'm sorry.
  I should not have dropped will's indiscretion like that at the party.
  No, you should've told me when you found out.
  I know, i know, i'm sorry.
  It's, just... You know how nina could be if you crossed her.
  I mean, she'd terrorize you.
  Seriously, i was scared of her.
  Em, i'm really sorry.
  Okay.
  I'm still pissed, but you're on probation.
  Hey, i would do community service for you.
  I would even wear an ugly orange jumpsuit for you.
  (all chuckle)
  Well, i'm touched.
  Thank god, i can call off the intervention.
  Hey, have you guys gotten any weird phone calls lately?
  Yeah, selling generic sex pills from india.
  No, thank you.
  No, like creepy, mysterious weird.
  I don't know. This guy called
  And said something about how we pretend to have
  Perfect lives online,
  On instagram and facebook.
  Well, he must be ancient if he thinks we're still on facebook.
  It's probably just jake being a douche.
  Brooke: Maybe.
  Yeah, maybe.
  (indistinct talking)
  Sheriff hudson: So, (sighs)
  Brandon james.
  I mean, you really think it's healthy to have
  An obsession with a serial killer?
  Brandon's actually classified as a mass murderer.
  You know, he killed them all the same night.
  You ever contacted anyone related to the events of that evening?
  Halloween '94.
  When i was in seventh grade, i was doing this report on nature versus nurture,
  And brandon seemed like the perfect subject.
  Yeah, so, i exchanged a few e-mails with his brother, troy.
  And, of course, i've tried to identify that mystery girl
  That brandon was in love with.
  -Well, any luck? -No.
  None of my theories panned out.
  You ever contacted kevin duval?
  Oh, no way!
  Survivor stalking is seriously rude.
  Plus, emma's in my class.
  Not that i wouldn't love to ask him
  What it was like to just face off against brandon james,
  But, you know, boundaries.
  Plus he doesn't live here anymore.
  And that.
  Okay, well,
  -I think we're done here. -Okay. (sighs)
  Oh, hey, um, thanks for saving my life.
  -(chuckles) -you're welcome.
  So, you got that house key?
  Oh, right, yeah.
  What was that about?
  I was at this thing the other night.
  Some jocks dumped him on a swim raft.
  No biggie.
  Who were the jocks?
  Sheriff, i'm your son.
  Not your 21 jump street snitch.
  Thanks for the lift.
  I had to drink and ditch the behemoth last night.
  Can't believe emma still won't talk to me.
  Maybe that's a bullet well-dodged.
  I mean, don't get me wrong, emma's sweet and all,
  But i'm guessing the sex was pretty amish.
  Jake, not helping, man!
  Look, the girls just don't get how nina was like a sexual sniper.
  When she targeted you, you went down.
  Maybe i should try a heartfelt apology.
  -Hell, yeah. -(chuckles)
  Work that big smile and that "aw, shucks" magic.
  (scoffs) shut up.
  Just, everything that's happened
  And this game on saturday,
  (sighs) i need her.
  Yo, grab some zen.
  Forget about the scout from duke,
  Forget about emma
  And forget about nina's murder.
  And any cyber-connection to nina,
  'cause it doesn't exist. Correct?
  Absolutely.
  We are officially cerrado.
  That's closed.
  For business.
  (clears throat)
  Son of a bitch!
  (reading) "i miss you nina bobina.
  "rest in prada. Love, miranda."
  Isn't that the girl nina fat-shamed
  Into some questionable guatemalan liposuction?
  -Sounds like our nina. -(scoffs)
  Piper: How would you describe nina's relationship with the other students?
  Teacher: As you can see, she was loved.
  -Very popular. -Yeah, yeah.
  Well, thank you very much,
  -And have a wonderful day. -You too.
  -Who's that? -Piper: Thanks for your time.
  Absolutely.
  Hey, guys, i'm piper shaw.
  I'm doing a story for...
  Autopsy of a crime.
  Yeah, your show is completely addictive.
  Thank you.
  -Fellow crime geek. -Totally.
  Uh, i'm noah foster. This is audrey.
  She's shy.
  You look really familiar.
  You probably saw my video.
  So, i'm trying to get past all of the faux-bff bs
  And get a clear picture of the real nina patterson.
  Did any of you know her?
  Yeah. Nina was a stone-cold bitch
  Who got what she deserved.
  That is pretty clear.
  -Can i quote you on that? -No!
  No, she's just saying words.
  And what about you?
  Did you have any thoughts on nina's murder?
  -You know, a few... -Someone's ass is toast!
  But some other time sounds good.
  -Jake: Noah! -What's up?
  Was it you, nerd?
  Was this payback for the lake?
  -Was what payback? -My truck.
  It went viral!
  -Well, i mean, you know... -Can it, les-beast.
  Hey, hey, leave him alone.
  -You know anything about this? -No.
  But, you know, it is a sad statement
  Of the decline of our public schools.
  -That's the wrong answer. -Whoa!
  I swear i didn't touch your truck.
  Jake: If i find out you were lying,
  I swear to god you are dead.
  I believe you.
  Misspelling douche was an interesting choice.
  Yeah, well i should've used the spray stuff.
  I got paint all over me.
  I looked like carrie at prom by the time i got home.
  (both chuckle)
  I don't care what the press says,
  Tyler's not some closet slasher-psycho.
  I mean, i can't really picture him doing it either,
  But if he's innocent, why doesn't he come forward?
  I don't know.
  Maybe he's afraid.
  I just wish he'd call me back.
  Hey, em, did you get my texts?
  Good luck. (chuckles)
  Yeah, i got your texts.
  Okay, well, i just want a chance to explain, okay?
  This is gonna sound like an excuse, but, the thing with nina?
  I think she came onto me because she felt threatened by you.
  Like she wanted some leverage.
  It's my fault that you slept with nina?
  No, you know how she played people.
  Yeah. We both knew.
  And i thought we had something better than that.
  Em.
  This doesn't have to be over.
  Hey.
  Do you have a problem?
  Well, that's my locker.
  And i'm pretty sure emma's done talking to you.
  Just stay out of this, abercrombie.
  Do you want some dueling pistols or something?
  (scoffs)
  Is that really your locker?
  Is that guy really your boyfriend?
  Well, the jury's still out on that one.
  And, um, fyi,
  I don't usually kiss guys in greenhouses.
  I was upset.
  I'll see you around.
  Audrey, can we please talk?
  (sighs) what's there to say?
  You and nina filmed me and rachel.
  She posted it all over the web.
  You lied about it and now you feel guilty.
  There, we talked.
  You're right.
  I didn't stop nina from filming you and i should have.
  But...
  Hey, can we please find a way to move on from this?
  I mean, pretty soon, there's gonna be a new headline.
  Oh, so i should be comforted by the fact
  That someone else is bound to be humiliated today?
  Those comments aren't going away
  And rachel...
  Rachel can't ignore them like i can.
  She won't even text me back.
  (cell phone chimes)
  (cell phone chimes)
  (cell phones chiming)
  (all talking indistinctly)
  That's the brandon james mask.
  Guess you got your new headline.
  Sheriff hudson: Okay, mr. Mayor.
  The last thing we need is the public seeing that damn mask.
  Who leaked the security footage?
  Nobody leaked anything, all right?
  Someone filmed the murder and posted it online.
  I got my tech guy trying to trace it right now.
  Nina's autopsy.
  Have you seen the gif, maggie?
  I mean, do you know anything about this?
  I know i never needed to see that mask again.
  (scoffs) well, the press is in heaven.
  When o'neill put on that mask,
  He connected nina to our infamous past.
  You weren't there back when we were scraping
  "murderville" off our town sign.
  We now have real economic development.
  People are moving here. We have a bike path, for crying out loud.
  Yes, tyler o'neill is my main person of interest, okay,
  But we don't know for sure that that's him behind that mask.
  Look, i talked to his foster parents.
  They're worried.
  They don't think he could have killed anyone.
  O'neill is hunkered down somewhere
  And he is going to make a mistake.
  You better be there to catch him when he does.
  You okay?
  After that gif went viral,
  Our hotlines lit up with brandon james wannabes.
  Any of them seem dangerous?
  No, we'll question each and every one of them.
  Plus i'm pulling the brandon james case files.
  I'm looking into possible suspects.
  I'm gonna keep you safe, okay?
  -(cell phone chimes) -woman: Sheriff, this just came in.
  Thanks.
  I got a call on kiley street.
  Me too.
  Oh, no!
  (sighs)
  Uh, hey, riley, wait up.
  Hey.
  Uh, i saw that gif.
  Just wanted to make sure you were okay.
  Yeah, i'm just a little freaked out by it all.
  Kind of hard to concentrate on computer science
  With a deranged killer on the loose.
  (chuckles) tell me about it.
  Mid-term projects are coming up,
  And i haven't decided on my concept.
  You know, i'm actually done with mine,
  If you need a hand.
  Oh, what're you doing?
  Uh, it's this app that links into any available downtime
  At the canberra dss satellite array.
  Basically, lets you tool around the universe from any mobile device,
  See the stars.
  Cool!
  But if you wanna stargaze, maybe you should go outside.
  (chuckles) lie down on the grass, look up.
  That's another way to go.
  If you wanna try it sometime.
  Oh, so like a you and me thing?
  Uh... (chuckles) that sounds...
  Hmm. (chuckles)
  (chuckles)
  I'll see you in class.
  Okay, i'll see you in class.
  I have zero game.
  (bell ringing)
  All right, guys, you know, phones down.
  But, the brandon james gif put us on the map, mr. B.
  I mean, we've got like seven of the top ten
  Trending hashtags right now.
  You know, maybe you should focus more on your studies
  And less on lakewood's web-buzz.
  Who can resist a murder selfie?
  Which is what the killer is counting on.
  All right, will graham, what is this killer's design?
  Well, murder's a lonely game, you know.
  I mean, say you're the killer, okay.
  You sneak into nina's house,
  You skulk around and scare her
  And then you kill her. Boom!
  But then what?
  You take a victory lap around the pool?
  You just stand there, watching the blood spread out in the water,
  Thinking your crazy guy thoughts.
  Creepy monolog alert.
  So maybe it's no good if he's the only one who's watching.
  Exactly, yeah!
  Uh, it's the age of instagram and youtube and tumblr.
  -I mean, we need to share the things we do... -(cell phone chimes)
  ...Or it's like it never happened.
  Riley, phones off.
  Sorry, mr. B.
  My friend from saint mary's texted.
  A girl that goes there died.
  Brooke: No way. Who was it?
  Jake: How'd it happen?
  It doesn't say.
  Branson: I'm sorry to hear that, riley.
  Uh, why don't we get back to...
  I have, uh, to go to the bathroom.
  (door slams shut)
  Branson: Actually, let's... Let's all take a minute.
  (sobbing)
  Audrey, is everything okay?
  I called rachel to check on her.
  (sniffles) her mom answered her phone.
  They found her hanging from her ceiling fan.
  She's dead.
  (noah sighs)
  Hey, you, you going home?
  Uh, my dad's coming to pick me up.
  I am officially distraught.
  Right.
  Um...
  I'm sorry about rachel.
  Yeah, well,
  Our relationship wasn't even legal
  Under the bylaws of lakewood municipal code, so...
  Gay rights joke.
  (chuckles)
  My friend, caden, goes to saint mary's.
  Apparently, rachel was just a train wreck looking for a station.
  Brooke, she just killed herself. And it's because of me.
  You can't blame yourself for that video.
  We were all there that day.
  But, i was the one in the parking lot with nina.
  I let it happen.
  I'm sorry, i just need a minute.
  (sighs)
  (sniffling)
  Girl: So tragic.
  Whoever posted that video
  Has even more blood on their hands now.
  Sounds like we got a new nina.
  Can i take that for you?
  Oh, sure. Sorry.
  I guess, i kind of set up shop here.
  If your boss is a squatter nazi,
  I can totally buy a breakfast burrito or something.
  I know your voice. You do that autopsy of a crime podcast.
  Good ear. I'm piper shaw.
  You're emma duval, right?
  Um, yeah, how did you know that?
  Research. I'm doing a profile...
  About the murder, yeah, i heard.
  Um, well, i'll let you get back to it.
  Your dad's kevin duval,
  The sole survivor of the brandon james attacks?
  I actually don't talk about that.
  Uh, sorry, i'm just trying to see if there's any connection
  Between what happened then and what's happening now.
  No agenda, just the truth.
  I also have a very serious caffeine addiction,
  So you'll be seeing a lot of me.
  Okay, well, you respect my privacy
  And i will keep you caffeinated.
  Fair enough.
  Good night.
  -(bottle rolling) -hello?
  (coughs)
  (gasps)
  (rattling)
  (breathing heavily)
  Em! (grunts)
  Whoa!
  Will!
  What are you doing here?
  Uh, i got your text.
  (heavy breathing)
  Em, are you sure you're okay?
  I didn't send you this text.
  Will: What?
  Someone is pretending to be me.
  Hey, it's okay.
  Maybe it's just brooke trying to play matchmaker.
  No. Brooke thinks you need a little more time on the bench.
  Great.
  Thanks, brooke.
  Em, (sighs) listen,
  I've been so busy explaining, that i never apologized.
  I'm really, really sorry.
  And there's no excuse, it was stupid, and thoughtless and crazy.
  The thing with nina, it was just once.
  Okay. I mean, i guess that's fair.
  The... (breaths deeply)
  The thing with me and kieran was just once, too.
  (scoffs)
  What thing with kieran?
  I kissed him at the party
  In the greenhouse and it felt great.
  (scoffs)
  I guess, i deserve that. (sighs)
  If i can't trust you, i can't be with you.
  I know and... I know i have to earn that back.
  It would mean a lot if you came to the game tomorrow.
  My dad is out of control.
  I'm under a lot of pressure.
  I'll try.
  This is odd.
  Hey, i figured you could use some caffeine.
  Look, honey, i don't usually mind you visiting me at work,
  But this one's a little disturbing.
  Is that rachel murray?
  She was a cutter?
  Yeah, she had some issues with depression.
  Yeah, yeah, audrey knew her.
  They were close.
  Rachel's mom mentioned something about a cyber-bullying video.
  Was audrey the one rachel was kissing?
  Yeah.
  (sobbing) nina was the one who filmed them.
  I was there.
  I let it happen.
  What?
  Emma!
  I'm sorry.
  (laughing)
  Maggie: The injuries don't make sense with where we found her.
  You mean hanging from a ceiling fan?
  Exactly. Her neck snapped.
  She would have to fall from much higher up for that to happen.
  Which means it's possible that rachel didn't commit suicide.
  Well, i'd have to finish the autopsy to be sure, but yes.
  Hey...
  What?
  What is it?
  Emma confessed that she could've stopped that video that went viral.
  She blames herself for this.
  But now, if rachel didn't commit suicide...
  I mean, not that that excuses what she did...
  I get it. I get it.
  Take the time you need.
  If this death is suspicious, it's...
  It's your call.
  What if that call is rachel murray was murdered?
  Then things just got a lot more complicated.
  Announcer: Welcome everyone,
  To george washington high school.
  And welcome, to the visiting stanton bulldogs,
  Taking on your home team, lakewood lancers!
  Sportsball! Yay!
  You see the scout from duke?
  (sighs) maybe it's better if i don't know which one is him.
  How'd it go with emma? Did it work?
  She's here.
  That's all that matters.
  Um, i'm gonna go get some licorice whips.
  Be right back.
  Really?
  Who the hell do you kids think you are? Give me that.
  Give it to me!
  Hey, you sure you're up for filming game highlights?
  'cause i'm happy to do it.
  I need the distraction.
  So, riley still hasn't texted me back.
  (sighs) i went full geek, with the stargazing app, right?
  Gosh, i wish there was, like, a line on a gauge somewhere.
  (cell phone beeping)
  Game on!
  Or, you know, i mean, i can totally stay and keep your batteries charged.
  Go. I can do this.
  You have other batteries to charge.
  You are the definition of da bomb.
  Hmm. Make good choices.
  Have fun.
  Good evening, lancer fans.
  Welcome.
  It has been (sighs)
  An emotional week for lakewood
  With the loss of two lovely young souls in our community,
  Nina patterson and rachel murray.
  -(camera beeps) -let's have a moment of silence.
  Riley!
  Uh, i'm here. (chuckles nervously)
  Riley!
  (shouting) riley!
  (sighs)
  -Just let your eyes adjust. -Oh, jeez!
  (stuttering)
  You're like a ninja!
  -That's racist. -What?
  Oh, no. (stutters)
  -I didn't mean like... -(laughs) come on!
  -Come on! -(laughing)
  -(whistle blowing) -(cheering)
  (clears throat)
  How's it shaking, mr. B?
  Good, thanks, brooke.
  Can i get a small popcorn?
  You know, you're not making this any easier.
  I'm not the one who discontinued our study sessions.
  When can we talk?
  Language arts.
  Third period.
  You know what i mean.
  (softly) i miss you.
  Then grow a pair and come get me.
  (cheering continues)
  Hey!
  Hi.
  Your boy's pretty good.
  You ever let him plead his case?
  Yeah. Right after i almost took his head off with a two-by-four.
  I was, uh.
  I was closing up at work and i'm pretty sure someone was...
  I don't know, trying to scare me or something.
  And then he showed up?
  -(whistle blows) -announcer: Turnover by the bulldogs.
  -Possession lancers. -What?
  It's classic.
  Messes with your head and then rescues you.
  No way.
  Did he ask you for one little favor?
  Something that tugged at your heartstrings?
  I thought so.
  Noah: Romance is always shoe-horned into genre fare.
  I mean, seriously,
  Why would sarah connor and kyle reese sleep together
  If they have the terminator chasing after them?
  Is that the new terminator movie
  With the dragon chick from game of thrones?
  No, no, it's the original!
  Ah! (chuckles)
  It's only, like, my favorite movie.
  Maybe we can watch it sometime.
  Sure or, you know, i can loan you my blu-ray.
  (chuckles)
  Oh, what about the walking dead?
  They're not rushing the romance.
  They've spent five seasons
  Letting daryl and carol fall in love.
  Right. Because we're all watching the zombie show
  To see if the hick and the housewife will sleep together.
  (scoffs)
  That's why i watch it.
  A girl loves a little romance with her gore.
  Um, these are really good.
  It's kind of herby.
  It's a basil cucumber martini.
  Always shaken.
  Never stirred.
  (chuckles)
  Noah,
  Are you a virgin?
  What?
  Uh. (nervous chuckle)
  No, no, i'm like a regular man-slut.
  Just like so many girl...
  -(cheering) -announcer: Ten seconds remain in the game.
  Will belmont, for three!
  Final score, 47-46.
  It's your lakewood lancers with the victory!
  Hey, thanks for being here.
  Yeah, everyone's here.
  You played a good game.
  Thanks.
  So what's up with that guy, huh?
  Do you like him?
  Will, i don't wanna have a fight.
  Good.
  'cause me neither.
  I miss that.
  Good night, will.
  Brooke, come on, let's go.
  Hi.
  I, uh, i liked the film you made for rachel.
  Thanks.
  It was just some clips.
  It was really beautiful.
  Look, i...
  I know that rachel had some issues.
  What, the cutting?
  Let me guess, you're gonna tell me that she killed herself
  -Because she was depressed. -No, no!
  I did this, okay?
  Whether the video was a tiny part of it
  Or the thing that pushed her over the edge,
  I am taking full responsibility.
  You have every reason to hate me.
  (alarm blaring)
  Automated voice: Kitchen door.
  Kitchen door.
  -Kitchen door. -(alarm stops)
  (telephone ringing)
  -Hello? -Man: Hi, this is gpp security.
  We got an alarm notice at your house.
  Can you give me your name and code word?
  Um, my name is emma duval,
  And the code word is, uh, "amethyst."
  Um, i, i just found my kitchen door open.
  Just take a deep breath, emma.
  We got a patrol nearby.
  He can be there in a few minutes.
  Should, i, maybe go wait outside?
  You're safer inside.
  If someone tried to break in, he probably took off when the alarm sounded.
  Would you... Would you stay on the line with me
  Until somebody gets here?
  Sure, i can do that.
  Sorry if i sound paranoid,
  It's just, my family has been harassed before.
  No worries.
  Whole town's on edge with all the brandon james talk.
  Um, how far away is he?
  Dispatch says three minutes, tops.
  So, what're you doing home tonight?
  Watching some tv?
  Anything good on?
  Is this your way of trying to distract me?
  (chuckles) you see right through me.
  Sorry, but it's not working.
  Come on. Humor me.
  -What do you like to watch? -I don't know.
  Uh, game of thrones, scandal.
  Man: How to get away with murder?
  Yeah. That one's pretty good, i guess.
  I like a strong female lead.
  You sound pretty tough yourself.
  If that guy's still in your house,
  Maybe he should be afraid.
  Don't even joke about that.
  (chuckling) sorry.
  Uh, so what else do you like?
  Comedy? Horror?
  Definitely not horror.
  Real life is scary enough these days.
  I barely sleep anymore.
  You do look tired.
  What?
  You sound tired.
  What's taking him so long?
  He's getting close.
  What you should really be asking is,
  Did you just lock me in or out?
  If you're in this house, i swear to god.
  What? You gonna try a little batting practice on me?
  Yeah, you're damn right i will.
  Gotta find me first.
  And i could be anywhere.
  I've got your number. I'm calling the police.
  By all means.
  They'll reach a nice confused man named art
  Who works at gpp security.
  And the cops will never get here in time.
  So i suggest you talk to me.
  What do you want from me?
  To show you the truth, emma.
  -About what? -Who you really are.
  And trust me, it's gonna hurt.
  You don't know me.
  But i do.
  And that's the real horror show.
  I know that everyone you trust
  Is lying to you, playing you.
  What are you talking about?
  Your two-faced friends,
  Your fraud of a family,
  Your whore of a mother.
  It all started with her, emma.
  But it's gonna end with you.
  See you soon.
