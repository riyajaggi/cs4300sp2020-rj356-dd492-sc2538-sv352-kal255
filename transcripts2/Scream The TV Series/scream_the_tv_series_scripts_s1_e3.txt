 Previously on Scream... Tyler O'Neill is my main person of interest. Tyler's not some closet slasher psycho. You are beautiful. You and Nina filmed me and Rachel. She posted it all over the web, and now she's dead. - Are you a virgin? - So many girl... Brooke, this cannot end well. - I miss you. - Then grow a pair and come get me. - Em, where you going? - You slept with Nina! Wait.

 And any cyber-connection to Nina, 'cause it doesn't exist. - Correct? - Absolutely. Hello? Hi. This is GPP security. You get that window locked up tight? Wait... What do you want from me? To show you the truth, Emma. Everyone you trust is lying to you. Your whore of a mother. It all started with her, Emma. But it's gonna end with you. Look out! Oh, oh, Brett, thank God! Oh, what is happening?

 That freak went crazy. Shh! I think he's close. What did you do to him? What he deserved. Dara? Oh, God! Oh, my God! You stay the hell away from me, psycho! No, no, no, no. Ahhh! Please, don't! Halloween night, 1994 was a bitch for Dara Aldean and Brett Kenner, victims one and two. Of course, no one knows exactly what their last words were. Except maybe Brandon James. So, Noah Foster, do you think that Brandon James just snapped that night? Nobody just snaps. I mean, a bomb doesn't become a bomb when the wick is lit. So if Tyler O'Neill is behind the mask in the GIF, is this an homage? In my humble opinion, nobody puts on a mask and commits a murder like that just once. The real question is, who's next? Scream - 01x03 Wanna Play a Game? So we are officially dealing with another possible murder. I was up all night finishing the autopsy. The ligature marks, dislocated vertebrae, crushed larynx... You don't see this kind of trauma hanging yourself from an eight-foot-high ceiling fan. So someone staged her body to look like a suicide. Why would they do that? Wish I knew. Rachel's wake's today. Let her family have a day to mourn. Tomorrow, I'll open a murder investigation. A mother's worst nightmare. Any more packages arrive at your door? Not since the heart. Which I can't stop thinking about. I'm still trying to locate your ex. Have you told Emma? Mmm-mmm. No, maybe I should. I'm trying to protect her. She's dealing with enough. And it'll bring up questions about my past that I just can't answer. _ I'm sorry, but cyber-sex is not what I had in mind when I told you to grow a pair. God, you are killing me right now. You're killing yourself. You could be here with me, in this five-star suite instead of testing our tantric limits online. Cyber-boundaries, Brooke. Safer that way. Why are you in a hotel? It's my mother's standing room. I come here for spa weekends when she's on one of her spiritual retreats. Which, lately, is always. Sounds complicated. Your game is boring. Mine is much more exciting. I'm listening. There is a very, very naughty picture of me hidden somewhere in your classroom. You might wanna find it before someone else does. Happy hunting, Mr. Branson. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, Brooke, no. Son of a bitch! Oh, Rachel. Audrey! Hey, hey! No, don't. - Here... - Get off me! - Were you just trying to... - No. I was... I was just testing to see if it's even possible. What are you doing here? Emma, this is Rachel's wake. Rachel didn't kill herself. What? My mom found something in the autopsy. The sheriff's opening a murder investigation. I knew it. I knew Rachel wouldn't kill herself. But who would want to kill her? I don't know. I'm really sorry, I've gotta go. I wanted you to hear it from me. Seriously? Emma, you just did your hair twirl thing. What's going on? Will! Will! We got a serious-ass problem, dude. The money is gone! I think Tyler took it. No, he didn't. I took it. What? Red card, dude. Took it where? Oh, you should be thanking me that I got to the cash - before Tyler could. - Not your decision. We're partners. Well, you promised to shut down our little operation, partner. And I know you haven't. I did! Okay. I considered your request. But you're not seeing the upside of keeping this thing going. That's because I don't have a rich daddy like you do. They trace this back to us, it's game over. My scholarship. Emma. Everything. Come on, bro. Where's the cash? Shut it all down. And maybe you'll find out. Bro. At first, I thought it was just some loser playing with his new voice changer app on his phone. But he won't leave me alone. So you think some deranged stalker killed Rachel to hurt you? Look, I know that I sound deranged. I don't know. Maybe I am. But this guy acted like he knew me. He said he wanted to show me the truth. Have you told your mom? I was going to, but she's the one he told me not to trust. What if you wrote him back? What? If this psycho did kill Rachel, I wanna know the reason why. He DMd you, right? Yeah. He opened a line. Let's direct message his ass back. _ Now we wait. I still haven't heard from Noah. Everything was going great on the football field, then he raced off like the McRib was back. He's clearly afraid to make a move, and you're too gorge for these romantic Special Olympics. Don't be mean. Not mean. Brutally honest. It's a different shade of mean. Speaking of... Wait. Is that Nina's lipstick? Yeah, well, someone's got to fill the lipstick power vacuum. Oh, come on. She'd love that I was carrying on her legacy. Right, Em? - Em? - What? What is with you? Seriously, Em. You okay? It's just... You're not still beating yourself up about that Saint Mary's chick, right? Because I'm sorry for Audrey, but that was not your fault. No. It's just... I can't believe that Nina's gone, you know. She's with us in spirit. Oh, hey, Em. Um, you got a second? I, uh, found this in my truck. Didn't feel right hanging onto it. I'm like three iPod generations past that. Actually, I don't even think I've used the word iPod in months. Yeah, but do any of them have your endless beach day playlist on 'em? Oh, my God. Wow, that day that you almost drowned your truck at the launch. Hey, who knew that boat was gonna be so heavy? Yeah. Yeah, that was a good day. Well, um, maybe I should hang on to it. No way. Sentimental value. Well, see ya. See, Aristotle asked, "Why are we here? What is the meaning of life in the face of death?" Bet Tyler's wondering the same thing right about now. Thank you, Jake. See, Aristotle also understood that volatile relationships, well, they can lead to tragedy. Looking for something, Mr. B? We're all looking for something, Brooke. See, desire, that's at the heart of drama. Desire for love. Power. Money. I'm talking about Jason and Medea. Talkin' about Anthony and Cleopatra. I'm talkin' about Emma and Kieran. Excuse me? I'm splitting you all into pairs. Uh, you and your partner will choose a dramatic scene to perform in class. Now, let's not just limit ourselves. We can... choose something contemporary, like movies. Audrey and Will. If you suggest the pool scene from Wild Things, I will end you. Or, if that's too much for your attention span, pick a favorite TV show, Riley and Noah. I'll even allow popular fiction, Jake and Brooke. How about Fifty Shades of Grey? In your dreams, mouth-breather. All right, everybody. Let's get going to the library, I'm gonna pair the rest of you up there. Get going on these selections. Let's go. "You have no idea how utterly unprecedented you are." "You can't say things like that." No, you're right. I really can't. Okay, so Fault in Our Stars is also a no. I mean, cancer kids on top of brutal murder might be a bit much. Yeah. Problem? Um, just my mom, you know. Every night is a late night since Nina. Yeah. Now my dad's either at the station or holed up at home with old dusty case files. Hmm. Wait. The Brandon James case files? Those are at your house? I'm sensing you might wanna come over and pick out a scene later. Maybe pick something from old TV. X-Files... Look, Brandon James almost killed my dad. Somehow my mom was involved. I need answers. I'm game. When should I come over? Actually, it might be better if I bring them to you. Thanks. You wanna do The Exorcist? It's classic. "The power of Christ compels you!" Loads of drama. Dramatic, maybe. Romantic? Not so much. You think our scene should be romantic? I did. But you never called, so... Riley, uh, I wanted to. Like a lot. And, you know, if I had, I would have said, "I wanna hang out. And be romantic. A lot." Wow. Is that Shakespeare? Uh, yeah, you know it. I think it's from his play A Mid-Semester Night's Hang Out. Okay, game on. But you better impress me. You play? Yeah. My dad taught me when I was little. Looks like you're pretty good. Was. I quit after he left. Maybe you can play for me sometime. Maybe... Whoa. These are from the crime scene. Damn. Is that him? Yeah. Before his surgeries. He looks so scared. I got to go. My dad's on his way home. Oh, well, we don't want you getting arrested. Yeah, wouldn't be the first time. - Seriously? - Tell you what. You play me a song sometime, I'll tell you the whole story. Your dad's name is Kevin, right? Yeah. His police statement says that Brandon James confronted his girlfriend, and that's what started all of this. Wait, my mom was his girlfriend. He calls her "Daisy." Oh, my God. Brandon James was obsessed with my mom. Christian Grey's red room of pain awaits you. Ugh! Ew. That would literally be like doing my brother. So Game of Thrones? I'm cool with that. Tell you what. I'll pick the scene and email you the lines. Now run along. Go find Will and continue tanking the school's collective IQ. What? Bromance on the rocks? I got one rule. I do not abide people I can't trust. Please. Trust is a campaign promise. Real life? You're either the cat or the mouse. Is that how it works with your college beau? Don't give me that look, I pay attention. But my question is, how do you know? Know what? Whether you're the cat or the mouse? You remember that viral video where the bobcat snatches the shark out of the ocean? It's sick. And up to that moment, I bet you the shark thought it was the apex predator. Are we, um, honing in on a point here? I'm just saying, maybe you're not at the top of the food chain. Maybe your boyfriend's got you thinking bobcat. But really you're just a shark. Hey, honey. Why didn't you tell me you were Daisy? Because it happened a long time ago. And I've been trying to put it behind me. But it isn't, is it? Someone knows. Mom, they sent you a heart in a box. I'm dealing with it. Are you? Because I'm pretty sure whoever is harassing you is the same creep that's calling me. He called you again? Why didn't you tell me? Do you really want to start comparing lists of secrets right now? What did he say? That my life is a lie. That you are a liar. Awful things. I'm sorry. But believe it or not, this is exactly what I was trying to protect you from. Really? Mom, I heard you talking to the sheriff this morning. And it really sounded like you were trying to protect yourself. Unless you wanna start talking about those mysterious questions you can't answer? Like, why is the sheriff looking for Dad? Nothing. Great. Was this whole cloak and dagger thing strictly necessary? Uh, you asked me to impress. Well, as long as my head doesn't end up in your freezer. - Yeah, you know, I never understood... - Oh. the whole head in the freezer thing. Brains are so much better at body temp, you just ask any zombie. Okay. - I will be right back. - Okay. Noah? Okay, now look. Is this is where you work? For a maximum of twelve hours a week, according to Department of Labor guidelines. It's beautiful. Uh, when we couldn't decide on a movie, I realized you haven't even seen some of the best drama out there. It's in video games. I mean, the cutscene that opens The Last of Us? Oh, my God. It's heartbreaking. You get me. _ - Hello? - Hello, Emma. I got your DM. I'll answer your questions when I'm ready. So, did Mommy give you the answers you were looking for? - I'm calling the police. - Say anything, and I will gut her. What do you want from me? Isn't it obvious? I want your trust, Emma. Why the hell would I trust you? Because I'm the only one around here telling you the truth. You're sick! I am done playing your games, and I'm done with you. _ _ Uh, remind me to send Mr. Branson a muffin basket, because you are the best scene partner ever. Uh, do you have a... - You know? - You know, uh, they say if you're not mature enough to say condom, you're not mature enough for sex. So do you? Ah. Uh, what, what was that? Relax, it's just my phone. Okay. Um... Oh, my God. _ Tyler? And just before Noah and I were about to, you know, Tyler finally texted back. He wants our help. And you just left the little dude hanging? - Harsh. - Jake, bigger issues. Wait, did you text him back? Yes. He said he didn't do it, but he's afraid that no one's going to believe him. I don't believe him. I told him to turn himself in. Wait, he texted you, too? Same time as Riley. Probably suffering from psycho killer's remorse. Guys, I don't think this is Tyler. It was from his number. It's not him. Someone has been calling and harassing me. Is that what was going on in the alley the other night? He's playing games with me. He sent you that text pretending to be me? Well, I'm pretty sure he's doing the same thing again. Why would some weirdo pretend to be Tyler on us? It's hard to explain. But I promise, you cannot trust him. Em, I have no idea who's screwing with you, but I know Tyler. He's afraid and we need to hear him out. Riley, we need to go to the police. So he can get shot like Brandon James? Riles, I love you, I do. But Tyler might have killed Nina. I vote cops. If they hurt him, it's on you. Riley! Yo, if Tyler talks to the cops, we may go down with him. I'll text him. Tell him if he'll meet us, we'll give him the cash. What? We will. - Emma. - Mom? What are you doing here? Sheriff Hudson called me. I'm your mom. So we checked phone records. These texts were sent from Tyler's account. I told you. Wait, are you sure? Couldn't someone else have used his phone? It's possible. But I think this is our one shot to bring him in. Text Tyler back. You know, ask him to meet up. Someplace public, but where he feels comfortable. Like the park on Route Nine. I don't know. I don't wanna lie. Riley, I would do it, I would. But Tyler knows I would totally set him up. You, on the other hand, are an angel. Listen, I know that you feel like you're betraying your friend. But if he's innocent, this is his best chance to prove it. It's his only chance. It's gonna be okay. We're doing the right thing. Are you trying to convince me, or you? Let's do this. Aren't we waiting for Tyler? I'm sure he's on his way. Money talks. Let's dig. You didn't text him. Did you? Do I detect a lack of trust, Will? That's hysterical. You didn't stash the cash here, did you? This is Nina, man. She's dead and she's still pitting us against each other. And I told you how to get out of it. I'm not gonna risk everything I've worked for just because you're still caught up in her blackmail drama. You don't get it, Will. There is no way out of this. So we can help each other. Or not. But then it's every man for himself. Riley's nearing the rendezvous. Nobody makes a move until I say so. He's not here. Do I wait? Hold on, hold on. Vehicle's approaching. Everyone stay alert. Stay alert. I'm gonna get a water. I hate this waiting. If anything goes wrong, Riley is never gonna forgive us. It won't. But if it did, she would. But it won't. Jesus. When this is over, we need a spa day. Who is it? Oh, um, it's my dad. I'll be back. _ Okay, come on out. Come on out. Let him see you. Stay close. All right, all right, he's making his move. Police! Show me your hands! Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on! Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, hang on. - Wait, this wasn't my idea. - What are you doing here? Some guy on the Internet paid me 200 bucks to drive here. And said to give this to some girl. - What? - Check my front pocket. Check my pocket. Put your hand in there. What? What is it? Riles. Talk to me. What're you thinking about? Besides Tyler? Noah. We were having this amazing time, and I just bailed. Jake's right, it was harsh. I just really like him, Emma. I have a feeling that he'll probably give you a second chance. Tyler set them up. He didn't show. But he said he'd be there. Where's Brooke? Where the hell is she? Glad you finally came to your senses. Mr. Branson? Hello... I wonder if Riley's had any luck? We've checked Brooke's house. I can keep driving, but is there anywhere else she might be? I don't know. Let me check in with the sheriff. I'm gonna put the word out. See if anyone's seen Brooke. - Hey. - _ - No, I'm with Emma. We're trying to find Brooke. - _ - _ - No. - No, she's not at the Maddox house. - _ - What do you have? - _ - All right. - _ I don't know. I guess we can keep driving. Yeah, I just got to figure out where else to look. Hello? Riley! - Are you okay? Where are you? - The station. Did you find Brooke? Stay put. I'm coming. _ _ We should get back to the station. _ _ _ Tyler? Tyler? _ _ Help! Someone help me! Help! Help me! Help! Help me! Noah! Riley! Riley, oh, my God! Uh, where are you? What's happening? He stabbed me. Please call 911. Who stabbed you? Where are you? On the roof. Tyler. He's gone. Hey, Riley, where are you? Just look around. Just tell me what you can see! I can see our stars. No! Riley, hey, no. Hey, you have to stay with me, okay? Please. Please! Riley? Riley? Okay. This gives new meaning to anticlimactic. _ Brooke! Thank God! She's okay. Where are you? In a nightmare of my own making. Okay, seriously, it might not be safe. Trust me, it's too safe. Riley's gone. - I gotta go. - Emma? A deputy saw a car that looked like Tyler's leave the station. They're going after it now. Everybody stop! Oh! No! Emma, wait! Suspect Tyler O'Neill. Vehicle reported crashed through construction on Kincaid Bridge. Riley! Riley! Riley! No. I didn't mean to choose. - sync and correction by solfieri - www.addic7ed.com
