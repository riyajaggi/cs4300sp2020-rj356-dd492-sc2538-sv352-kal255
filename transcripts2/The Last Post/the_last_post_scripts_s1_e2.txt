 This isn't Aldershot, is it? I can't tell you how happy that makes me. Captain Page came to say goodbye. What am I going to do without you? I think you should put some effort into being Mrs Laithwaite. I'm just not one of the boys, Al. I'm so glad I'm married to you. What a funny thing to say. Such close relationships we make in army life, but we pack up and we move on. Abdul Kadir Hakim -- he'll do anything to get rid of the British.

 Come back, sir! I want a search party out, now! Tony... Yusra. SHE SOBS INSECTS CHIRP Aye, you just told me. You're going to go and make yourself a cup of tea. You just... No, not for me, Dad, thanks. I'm 2,000 miles away, Dad, remember? Listen, I just called to say that, erm... It's... It's Alex, Dad. It's your son.

 Well, I just called to say that I'm, eh... Yep. Yeah, I remember the old songs. Of course I do. ♪ There was a soldier ♪ A Scottish soldier who wandered far away ♪ And soldiered far away ♪ There was none bolder ♪ With good broad shoulder, he... ♪ He fought in many a fray ♪ And fought and won. ♪ Dad? Dad? HE SOBS How is he? HE EXHALES He's fine, aye. Nobody ever died of a lost memory. Are you ready for this, Dimarco? Born for it. You, Sarge? Aye. Let's go. Let's get this done. This one's for Nick Page. ENGINE ROARS HE SIGHS Where are you going? Work. Where's Mummy? She's in hospital having the baby. Yusra will look after you. Is the baby going to live here? HE CHUCKLES Yes. You, me, Mummy and the baby. We can play soldiers when I get back. Promise? On parade 1800 hours, Corporal Markham. Mmm. Back to sleep. SHE SIGHS Oh, no. What time is it? Early. A good wife would have been... would have been up and cooked her husband breakfast. You've got seven minutes. What time will you be home? I'm not sure. It's best if you don't know too much. But you'll be home for tea? Hmm? Mmm, mm-hmm. What shall I make? Ah, you decide. It's not plugged in. Oh, it won't take too long. I have to go. Mmm. Sorry. Corporal Stoneham, he says it is time to go. HE TAKES A DEEP BREATH HE CLEARS HIS THROAT Look after him. Of course. SOBBING AND MOANING SHE SCREAMS BABIES CRY SHE PANTS Terribly sorry. MOANING Aden, where East meets West -- vital as an oil refinery, as well as a Gulf trade route. The beach here at Aden is lovely. The sand is warm, and the sharks are not always hungry. GUNFIRE The occasional outbreaks of violence are caused by what are officially called dissident tribesmen. As long as there's trouble, there must be troops. The Queen has full confidence in Aden's future, describing it as the perfect example of Colonial rule. The raid party will be landing as I speak, including Baxter and Dimarco. Their objective -- to capture one man. The target's code name is Starfish. He's brutal, he's clever... His real name is Abdul Kadir Hakim, and we believe he's responsible for the murder of Captain Page. Now, we've received intelligence that Starfish will be at a remote farmhouse here, which the raid party will storm at 1300 hours. Our job is to rendezvous upcountry with the raid party on the other side of the mountain, where they'll be handing Starfish over to us for escort back here. We'll be in two Land Rovers travelling in convoy. Captain Martin will command the second Land Rover. Now, we'll have to use the Dhala Road, I'm afraid. We've no choice about the route. Just seven miles of it. We will maintain complete radio silence from the moment we leave this base, and it stays that way until we return with the prisoner. This operation cannot be compromised. If one Land Rover gets into bother, the orders are clear -- the other continues to the rendezvous at all costs, sir. (If we make it that far.) What's that, Stoneham? Nothing, sir. Sorry, sir. Good. Oh, one more thing, erm... There's a reporter coming with us, so tomorrow the world will know what a damn good job the Royal Military Police is doing. - Sir. - Sir. Prepare the vehicles. Await my orders to leave. Dismissed. Sir? Orchover? Is it a girl or boy? Erm... No news yet. We don't know. LIGHTER CLICKS HE EXHALES MARY PANTS I'm afraid I don't think there's time for that. Cleanliness is next to godliness. I make the rules here. SHE SCREAMS WHIMPERING [Left, right, left, right, left, right, left!] [Left, right, left, right, left, right, left!] ♪ Love letters straight from... ♪ [Help! Help!] [Help!] Help! HELP! Help! I like your nightie. Oh, er, it's... Frilly. Yes. SHE INHALES AND EXHALES Is he good at fucking? Your handsome husband. Oh... Why aren't the raid party bringing in Starfish themselves? They're on foot. Why? It was going to be 1 Para, but the terrain makes a parachute drop impossible, and the chopper's too noisy, so it's a speed-march in from the coast. Royal Marine Commandos? Oh. They do exist, then. It's a great honour for any member of this regiment to serve with the SAS. Captain Page was halfway between leaving us and joining them when he was killed. They've asked for us to do this with them. It's a tribute? Yes. That's exactly what it is. Weapons party, weapons in the hangar, now! Weapons party, weapons in the hangar, now! What? Ed, have a word. Make sure he's ready for this. Sir. Lance Corporal Armstrong, let's have a look at that ankle of yours. The Dhala Road, sir... Yeah, sometimes it's better to just get on and do something and not talk about it. Sir. Sorry, sir. Everything I know about soldiering, I've learned from Orchover. No harm in asking your corporal for advice. OK, men, two minutes to zero hour. - Does this hurt? - Yeah. - Here? - Yes. - This? - Ow! Well, you're not fit for this. You're going to have to stay here and hold the fort with me. Er, it's not anywhere in battle-dress regulations, but there's a convention that one roll up from the elbow is right. It's not. It isn't enough. I go a whole roll higher -- that takes you clear of the muscle, then the arm has maximum freedom of movement. People laugh at me, but it can mean a quarter of a second quicker reloading. I've seen fatal delay. I know what a quarter of a second can mean. GUN CLICKS Load up! HORN HONKS It's the reporter. It's the Seven Dwarves. Which Jeep am I in? HE CLEARS HIS THROAT Yusra, I came to thank you. I'm alone. You must go. It's dangerous for me. Look, if you don't want me to talk to you again, just tell me now and I won't. No-one can know I helped you escape. Promise me. How did you know it was a scorpion? Well, it's always a scorpion, unless it's a snake. Oh, I had a snake my first week here. Where was it? Oh, you have to check every time. Where? Bottom of the bed. SHE SCREAMS, LAUGHTER MARY SCREAMS There's a little blood. SCREAMING You have to push! This baby has to be born now! SHE WHIMPERS PANTING That's it. There, there. There we are. The baby's out. BABY CRIES It's OK. Fetch the doctor. BABY CRIES Where's my baby? Is it all right? SHE GROANS, SPLASH Oh... This is Mary Markham's. SHE SIGHS You should be naked in bed with your brand-new husband. There'll be a time for nighties. Where are they going today? Upcountry, which is a euphemism. Well, it's best we don't know too much. Is that what he said? In case the NLF kidnap us, and tie us to a tree, and take away our virtue, and force us to tell them battle plans we've been discussing with our husbands? Hmm... Do you love him? Of course. In every breath and between every breath? Yes. You must love Ed very much. Why do you say that? I don't know, just the way you talk about love. SHE CHUCKLES MUSIC: Love Letters by Ketty Lester Quickly, we're coming through! Ah! Call him Peter. - Doctor? - Yes? The baby -- Peter. My husband, Major Markham, I don't want him worrying. - Please don't tell him. - Mmm... SHE BREATHES HEAVILY It's only seven miles, Stoneham. It'll be over before you know it. You sit up front. Thank you. CAR DOORS SLAM, GUNS CLICK Foot down. Straight ahead. Don't look at anything other than the road, OK? Let's go! GUNSHOTS Contact front! GUNFIRE GUNFIRE First time? We're behind time. Mile and a half. We'll run in. Move! Let's go, let's go, let's go! - Are you all right? - Yes, sir. So pick it up. Come on. Come on. - Nine hours, we calculate... - Sir? .. that you were out there. Yes, sir. Erm... Did anyone help you in any way? No. Nobody. You stayed away from people? That's right. Good. Sir, I can't feel my foot... Oh, no, that's good. You keep it in there. FAN WHIRS SHE SPEAKS ANOTHER LANGUAGE DOOR OPENS They're here. MUSIC: A World Of Our Own by The Seekers My dresses! No more frilly nighties for you. ♪ Close the door Light the light ♪ We're staying home tonight ♪ Far away... ♪ We should go to the club. The club? The BP Club. Let's go. Oh, but the men'll be back soon and... You can swim and lie in the sun and come back glowing for your Joe. ♪ In a world of our own ♪ We'll build a world of our own that no-one else can share ♪ All our sorrows we'll leave far behind... ♪ Ally? Alison? ♪ And I know you will find... ♪ HE SIGHS ♪ There'll be peace of mind ♪ When we live in a world of our own ♪ Oh, my love Oh, my love ♪ I've cried for you so much ♪ Lonely nights without sleeping ♪ While I longed for your touch ♪ Now your lips can erase the heartache I've known ♪ Come with me to a world of our own ♪ We'll build a world of our own that no-one else can share ♪ All our sorrows we'll leave far behind us there ♪ And I know you will find... ♪ Did you know Nick Page well? Yes. It was hard for Joe, anyway, following in his footsteps, and now he's dead it's even harder... ENGINE ROARS Really? Oh! Oh, my. ♪ Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh ♪ Ooh-ooh-ooh... ♪ Bring the squad to a halt! HE PANTS What's that? It's my father, sir. Nothing that can identify a soldier comes with us, ever. We don't exist. Show me your feet. - I'm fine, sir... - Boots off, soldier. HE GROANS It's just blisters, sir. Jesus Christ. I didn't want to let anyone down, sir. You didn't want to let your regiment down. I'll be fine, sir. I can't tell you how many deaths I've seen caused by pride masquerading as bravery. We won't make it to the target on time, sir. We will. Packs off! Swap out. Two hours -- we'll be back for you. No... Sarge, just get me a beer later, all right? MUSIC: The Very Thought Of You by Tony Bennett ♪ Face in every flower... ♪ LAUGHTER Johnny, get over here! ♪ Your eyes in stars above... ♪ Oh, what's that smell? Fish and chips, gin, Ambre Solaire... This is my favourite place in the world. Who's that? Harvey Tilbrook. What does he do? He says he's a BP man. - He says? - He's not. How do you know he's not? Oilmen never take their jackets off. So what does he really do? (He's a big fat spy.) Ah! Lassie or Elvis? Hello, Harvey. What are you talking about? With Mrs M still in hospital, you're in charge of Christmas, and the club needs to know the Christmas afternoon film. The Third Man. THEY LAUGH This is Joe Martin's wife. Nick Page's replacement, so actually it's you in charge of Christmas. Your husband outranks her husband. Hmm... I hear you work for BP. My husband swears by BP. We almost ran out of petrol once in Norfolk because he wouldn't stop at an Esso garage. 16 miles south of Cromer on the A14. Can we get a drink while you two talk about roads in East Anglia? The usual, Clive. Certainly, ma'am. Oh, a bitter lemon. With a twist? Yes, please. You stick a double in that and put it on my tab. HE PANTS SHE WHIMPERS VOICE SHAKING: I can't seem to stop shivering. You're cold because that's what happens when you lose blood. It's not... It... It's not... Could I have a word, Doctor? Oh... - It's not stopping. - I can see that. - Well, perhaps Colonel Amery... - No, I can fix this. How? Get the anaesthetist. Let's get her under. - For what? - Hysterectomy. - But Colonel Amery... - Just get the anaesthetist, Nurse. Take up defensive positions. CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS It's a Land Rover... CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS .. not a Jeep. SHE CHUCKLES I could show you around. Sure. What? The Land Rover, it... The door comes off, so when you're jumping in and out you don't have to bother about a door to open and close all the time. DOOR CLATTERING Slow down. Relieve Orchover, Stoneham. If anything happens out here, you're on your own. We have responsibility for each other, but not for you. Thank you. It makes a change not to be patronised by a man in uniform, and it makes my job of reporting on who you kill and how and why, so much easier. CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS And now he wants to perform a hysterectomy. Oh. Who's the doctor? - Dr Rankin. - Hmm... It's not lack of experience in junior doctors that kills patients, it's pride. Who is she? Her name's Mary Markham. - Oh, my God! - You know her? - I was at Sandhurst with Harry Markham. - Oh... We're in, sir. - For what? - Hysterectomy. - Close her up. - Sir? Get me six feet of rolled bandage, soak it in iodine and fold it three times. - Sir... - A big hole in the groin from a piece of shrapnel and it wouldn't stop bleeding, so we packed it tight with every bandage we had. I mean, we really jammed it in. MACHINE BEEPS Sergeant Paul Miller in Malaya, 2nd of June, 1957. We're going to do the same thing with Mary Markham. What are you all looking at? Move. BIRDSONG INSECTS CHIRP I'm sure it'll be fine, sir. I don't like us being in one place for too long. I meant Mrs Markham. Right. Yes, of course. BOTTLE SQUELCHES Do you want a drink with me some time? Mmm, mmm... WAVES LAPPING I think the answer's yes... about Joe. In bed? Mm-hmm. Good. That's good. Of course, it means he's had other girls -- dress rehearsals for you. But you need to be the one. You need to be surprising, and unpredictable and profound. DELIGHTED SCREAMING I want you to be happy. Let's swim. MUFFLED, INDISTINCT SPEECH AIR HISSES The bleeding's stopped. Sergeant Miller in Malaya -- did he live? The risk of infection is high. But did he live? Get her husband here now. - Understood. - Thank you, Doctor. It's Mrs Markham, sir. She's... It's touch and go. They've asked for the Major. Let's go. Load up! INSECTS CHIRP HE GRUNTS BIRDS SQUAWK I'm sorry about Nick Page. Can you dive? No. I'll teach you. Come on. Oh, erm... All right? - Yeah. Well, what if there's something in the...? - Arms up. - Arms up. - Arms up. - Head down. - Oh, no, hold on, how deep is it? It's deep enough. - Oh... - Kick your legs out. That's all there is to it. Ah! Very good. What are you doing that for? The sharks don't like it. - Oh... - Huh? Should have a shark net, really, but stones seem to work. Oh, Harvey! LAUGHTER Come on. There we go. Very graceful. Alison? Alison! Whoo! SHE LAUGHS HE PANTS INSECTS CHIRP CANTEEN CLATTERS DISTANT ENGINE RUMBLES Ah... Hey! Armstrong! Stop, stop, stop! HE PANTS Sergeant! Sarge...

Look, I don't know how to say this... What is it? I'm... I'm frightened of heights, sir. HORN HONKS Who the hell is that? HONKING CONTINUES Halt! - Sir... - Yes. It's your wife.

Amen. WIND HOWLS Sir, it's Dimarco... CAMERA CLICKS You can't do that. It's my job. They knew. They know. It's there for us to see. It might be an ambush. Sir, we should do something. Sir? Miss Franklin! Miss Franklin... IN OWN LANGUAGE: CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS (Christ...) Baxter, no! Don't touch it, Sergeant -- it may be booby-trapped. SPEAKS IN OWN LANGUAGE If you were to apply for compassionate leave, you'd probably get it, because you'd be applying to me. He fought in the Great War, your father? He doesn't like to talk about it. Men don't. There's a photograph of him, in uniform. He looks... .. like a... .. proper soldier. Perhaps you could show it to me sometime. I don't have it any more. But... .. you could talk to him, couldn't you? Have you ever... .. talked to him about it? - I'll drive you to the hospital, sir. - Thank you.

Alison Laithwaite. She's a friend already. - She can't be. - What? Why? Her husband is not an easy man, and I'm superior in rank to him. - Well, you can sort that out. - Not if my wife is undermining me! - What do you mean? - Through her relationship with Alison Laithwaite. - Alison doesn't care about that kind of thing. - I do!
