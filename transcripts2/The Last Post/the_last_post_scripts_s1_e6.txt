 At 1800 hours, the NLF will be ending my son's life. They're offering a swap... Kadir in exchange for George. We don't talk to terrorists. I took a look at your story, poor Valerie Cotton. You're a pregnant woman, you don't know what you're saying. You're the one making me have these babies! I'm here to see Martha Franklin. I'm Captain Martin's wife. So this is not a friendly visit? No, I love him. I don't want you to have anything to do with this, Armstrong.

 You won't pull this off without me. Tony. One woman and a child, in exchange for your great leader. Mummy! Daddy! Captain Martin, I'm placing you under arrest, for allowing the escape from lawful custody of a prisoner of war. Open. Legs apart. What are you looking for? Aden, where east meets west. Vital as an oil refinery as well as a Gulf trade route. The beach here at Aden is lovely. The sun is warm and the sharks are not always hungry. The occasional outbreaks of violence are caused by what are officially

 called dissident tribesmen. As long as there's trouble, there must be troops. The Queen has full confidence in Aden's future, describing it as the perfect example of colonial rule. What are you doing? Cover for me. Where are you going? Look, the NLF will kill Yusra for what she did. And we're letting it happen. I'm not having that. Please, please. Corporal Armstrong. Where is he? On patrol, sir. - Get him back. - Erm, there's no radio contact, sir. It's a problem up in Radfan. - Bang! Bang! - I see. - Bang! Bang! Bang! - Yes. Bang. Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! That's settled, then. Ten o'clock tomorrow. Goodbye. - Bang! Bang! Bit quieter, darling, Daddy can't hear himself think. Where's Yusra? Go and play in your bedroom, George. Well, they've taken a statement from me, - which means I have to give evidence. - In court? Against Joe? It's not "against" him, Mary, it's just the facts. I gave the order, he disobeyed it. He saved George! Mary... - I don't understand. He'd be dead if it weren't for Joe Martin. An order is an order, there's nothing I can do for him. You're part of the prosecution case against the man who saved our son's life. He saved me from the bad men. Yes. So why is he in prison? Will they shoot him, Daddy? Joe saw all of these. He was there. And was asked to deny that it had ever happened. But he kept the film. Yeah, you know a good man by what he does under pressure. Do the British want these photographs destroyed because they're embarrassing? Yes. Because they tell a story that isn't the official account of what is happening here? Sure. Do the families of these men deserve to see them? I think so. I should go to him. Honor. The little man has to lose. You do know that? Every time. What was it? You know what the order was. I can make this so hard for you. Eczema. The heat makes it almost intolerable. He never gets through an interview without a good scratch. Maybe this time. The order was to escort a prisoner. Who gave you the order? Major Markham. Did you obey it? No. Do you know what it means to disobey an order? Yes. Sit down. I had a choice. A child with his whole life ahead of him... Who do you think you are? I want you to listen carefully, because this is the most important thing you will ever hear. The whole of High Command know who you are, they're taking a real interest in Captain Babyface. If you decide to fight us, we will expose you. Does your new wife know about your sordid past? What do you want? Help me. Help yourself. Yusra! Yusra? The NLF don't like it when you help the enemy. The family. Locked inside, burnt to death. But not Yusra. Where is she? I know where she is, but you need to go. Where is she?! Where is she?! Where is she? Where is she?! - Where is she?! - You should go. You need to go now. Go now. Yusra! Go! You should go! You should go! You should go, go! Cucumber. Thank you. I want an abortion. That's against the law. Yes. I'm asking you to help me. Why do you feel you want to do this? Why do you feel you can ask? I'm a doctor. I can't just... Really? Why not? You know better than me what I want? I didn't ask you here for moral guidance. It's my duty... It's none of your business! I would do it myself if I could, but I can't. Please. What does your husband say? Joe... I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking of you. I should have been. No. No, you were just being brave. I'll be discharged from the army and I... It'll be years, Honor... and when I get out... don't wait for me. Find a new life. - Take the handcuffs off. - I can't do that. He's in a cell in the most secure building in Aden with the British Army guarding him and you need to keep his hands tied so he can't hug his wife?! What kind of man are you? Just tell the truth and everything will be all right. There. That's what I loved about you. Such uncomplicated innocence. Here's Honor, as she is, as she always will be. Loved? You said "loved". Love. - Then that's enough. Everything's unpicked by love and the truth isn't frightened of anything or anyone. It's not that simple, I'm not that simple. There's something you don't know about my past, Honor... Shhh. Not now? I brought the film to Martha. I've seen the photographs. Honor... Why didn't you destroy it? I think it's because deep down, you don't think that concealing the truth can ever be right. Time's up! When my mother fell asleep on the chair on a Sunday, my father would steal in and allow himself to go back to their beginnings and whispered to her, "When you are old and grey" "and full of sleep, and nodding by the fire, "take down this book, and slowly read, "and dream of the soft look your eyes had once, "and of their shadows deep." "How many loved your moments of glad grace," "and loved your beauty with love false and true," "but one man loved the pilgrim soul in you." Look at me. Hold on to love for dear life, Joe. When you have it. So an accused is, erm, well, he's allowed someone alongside him to talk to, to take advice from, to cross examine witnesses for, as a kind of pal, you know, so, well, they call it an officer's friend. Did you know that? I did what I did and I'd do it again. There's no advice to give. Do you know you almost sound as if you think you deserve to be punished for this? It's very nice of you to offer to be my... What's it called? My friend. I don't really need your help... Yeah, well, you don't have a choice, I'm afraid, cos you saved my life. Yeah, a life for a life. I was dead, Joe. I was dead on that road. They told me at the hospital. I had minutes left to live when you came for me. You dragged me back from the edge. I can't imagine where you got the courage and the strength. - So where's your fight now? - I have to plead guilty. What about Honor? Well, do you feel guilty? Because if you don't, and you plead guilty, then you'll wake up the morning after you've been sentenced you're going to look at the wall of your cell and you'll know that there is nothing you can do in the rest of your life that will correct the mistake you made in not being honest with yourself. I'm not sure you'll survive, Joe. There's no defence, is there? Why don't we trust in the moral high ground being a good place to defend oneself? Bang! Bang! You're dead. I've got you now. You... What would happen if you said no? What if you told them you wouldn't give evidence? Then my career would be over. I see. Bang! Bang! You're dead, you're dead, you're dead! You can't stay with me. It's not safe. I saw your house. Your whole family. I thought you were dead. I wanted to die. I thought I'd never see you again, I... I'm never leaving you. Jesus Christ. Sorry. Hello. I, I was just... The door was open? - Yes. - Were the lights on? What? II think so. And the fan? Did you turn that on? No. I'm sure... Laundry. I didn't send any. Shall I put it away? Just leave it! Thanks. Last time I was here, I saw Harvey Tilbrook. He lied to me. - What about? - Seeing you. Why would he do that? I don't know. But I saw him talking to a man in the hotel lobby. Who? There's nothing to worry about. Prosecution have got it all in hand. I'll have the glass, you have the bottle. Other way round, maybe, sir? It's court in the morning. So, why are you here? If your job were one thing... if being a sergeant in the British Army boiled down to one thing...? Knowing my officers and my men better than they know themselves. - Captain Martin? - Is a good man. Major Markham? Doesn't need to ask his sergeant what to do. Hut! Hut! Hut! All sit. Remove head dress. Yes, Mr Bishop. I swear by Almighty God that the evidence I give shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. Who gave Captain Martin the order to escort Kadir? - I did. - Personally? Directly? Yes. Did you later discover whether the order had been carried out? Yes. And had it? Was the order carried out, Major Markham? No. What would you have done? If you had been in Captain Martin's shoes? What if it was his son that was being held hostage, sentenced to die, clock ticking down and you had the chance to save him, what would you do? Your duty? His child? My duty. Thank you, Major. And if it were your own child? Abraham was prepared to kill his own son because God demanded it of him and what about you, sir? If the Army demanded it of you, would it be the right thing? Erm... No, it wouldn't. I'm sorry. This is all hypothetical. Well, if this officer, whom everyone describes as the best, the most upstanding of men, tells us that there are circumstances in which it is right to disobey an order, then it proves the possibility exists. A principle is starting to be established. Disobeying an order can be the right thing to do. I don't agree. Law and morality are the same thing. - What, in Nazi Germany? - This is not Nazi Germany. Or at Amritsar. Would you have shot those 600 defenceless men, women and children because your commanding officer asked you to do it, Brigadier? The question's not a rhetorical one, sir. It is impertinent! If my CO's moral map has room in it for conscience, then this is not a strict liability offence. I, I'd like to say something. When I gave the order to Captain Martin, my son was missing. I believed then that he was certain to die. And the end of his life felt like the end of my life. Every decision I have made as a commanding officer, every order I have given has been done so with the deep care that the privilege of commanding the best soldiers in the world asks for. Major... - However, when I gave that order to Captain Martin... I was not fit to do so. I was unfit to command my men. I'm sorry. In interview, you were asked if you disobeyed an order? Did you? Yes, morally it was the only choice. Yes, the moral man. Where were you on the afternoon of Christmas Day? I had work to see to. What kind of work? An interview. On Christmas Day? - Yes. - Who were you interviewing? - A reporter. - Name? Martha Franklin. In the office? - No. - Somewhere else on the base? In a bar. On Christmas day? Yes. Did you tell your wife that you were going off to meet a woman in a bar? - Not exactly. - Well, yes or no? Not exactly. You're going to have to explain that answer for those of us who believe the truth to be a simple concept. What the truth is or appears to be always depends on who's looking at it, wouldn't you say? Did you tell your wife where you were going? Yes or no. No. When did you next see Martha Franklin? The next day. - Boxing day? - Yes. Same bar? - No. - Where? The Gordon Hotel. In the lobby? - No. - In the bar? I wanted to explain... No, no, where did you meet for your interview, Captain Martin? In her room. Are you a moral man, Captain Martin? It's over, isn't it? I'm going down. Honor. What? I want them to hear her talk about you. I'm not going to put her through that. That'd be up to her. It's fine. I can hide. But with a British soldier beside me, it's not possible. You must go. No. If you love me, if you want me to be safe, you have to go. CocaCola, please. Ice, no lemon. It's up to you what I drink? You're a guest. - Sometimes you forget, you people. - The interview has to be in English. Kadir's English is better than my Arabic. You don't make the conditions. If it's not in English, I won't agree to it. So, you see, I do. Western arrogance. No. A reporter's rules. How do we know we can trust you? You don't. I'll write whatever I like. I mean, how do we know we can trust you, not to bring the British Army with you? Well, you don't know that either. Except it would go against everything I believe in as a reporter. These are just words. What else is there? He did the right thing, for honest reasons. My husband's a good man. I know he is. Thank you. How long have you been married? Nine weeks. And before you were married, how long had you known him? Not long. We, erm, we met on Valentine's day. - How romantic. - Yes. How much do you know about his life before he met you? Does the name Valerie Cotton mean anything to you? No. Really? Nothing? She drowned herself a week after writing a letter to your husband. My goodness. The letter says, "I love you." "I will leave my husband and my children" "if you promise to be with me." "If you don't make the promise, I cannot live." She received no reply. You really don't know about this, do you? Sorry? Did you meet him at a dance? Yes. Is he a good dancer? Erm... Yes. That's about all you can say, isn't it? Concerning the character of your husband? "He's a good dancer." Thank you, Mr Bishop, court will resume at ten o'clock tomorrow morning. Martha? CocaCola... ice, no lemon. - Shall we begin? - Yusra's family. - Was that you? - We kill people who betray us. You cannot win... militarily. You see, Britain, deep down, is very ashamed of Empire. She doesn't want to be seen talking of her shame, - but she feels it nonetheless. - Are you talking to them? - Yes. If that were true, you wouldn't tell me. Go on. Why not carry on negotiations? Why wreck it all by telling a journalist? It's very simple... true independence is not given away, it's taken. You want me to write a story about secret talks? People in Britain need to confront their shame. I'm thinking about Great Britain as well as Aden. The benevolent terrorist. Now, Miss Franklin. What is this word? Is Mandela a terrorist? Kenyatta? Nehru? And, anyway, the British government, they don't talk to terrorists. Most certainly not about handing over of power to them. You're using me to expose the hypocrisy. Absolutely. Who have you met with? A very distinguished and rare old bird. The Minister for Colonies. How can I verify this? Your laundry is back in your drawer, your fan is off, the light on your desk is off, and the photographs destroyed. You've been spying on me. Not us. What are you doing here? I don't have time to talk. I have to write a story and it has to be now. You look terrible. Joe has a past I didn't know about. You found out? In court. Barristers are bullies. We all have secrets, Honor. Apart from you. They think that by telling me something I don't know about Joe, they'll turn me away from him. They're wrong. I love him and I don't know him, but both things can be true. Right? It's the first one that matters. - I thought you might be dead. - Ha! Why? Well, because without the photographs, it all depends on you. I have a story to write. It's the biggest of my career. Then Joe will go to prison. What is it that you said? The... the little man has to pay the price... every time. What are you doing? Whitehall, London, please. Martha Franklin, Washington Post. Can you put me through to the Minister of Colonies? Just a few questions. He's... He's overseas? He's in London. Thanks. This is the man you saw talking to Tilbrook. Officially, he's not here. You know what they say at Sandhurst? If you can't see your face in your shoes, they're not ready. And can you? Sir. Something for you. Sir. What is it? Redemption. What about the German cars? - You're home early. - I thought I could take George swimming. Yay! Swimming! - Colin Calvert. Cabinet Minister. - Yes, that's him. That's the man I was taking to The Gordon Hotel. His code name's Owl. There, Owl. Date, time. Pick up 12:55 hours, delivery 13:30. Coordinates eight, eight, four, triple one. No. That can't be right. Triple one? I remember that. That's where I was taking Kadir. Starfish. Starfish and Owl. The Minister was here to meet with the terrorists. The Government have been talking to the men who would have killed George Markham. I know you've been talking with Kadir. I know the distinguished Cabinet Minister is in Aden to hold secret talks with the leader of a terrorist organization who kidnap small children. I know his people in London are lying about his whereabouts. I know all this, because there is a military logbook that verifies it. And I know just how embarrassing all this would be if I were to publish it. What would the headlines be? There'd be no story. You'd give up your story. Mr Bishop. After much careful consideration, the Crown has taken the view that there are now compelling reasons why it is not in the interests of justice or the national interest to pursue this prosecution further. What's he saying? He's saying you're a free man. All rise. What? Kiss. Well... I've done everything I can. There's just one more thing. No, two. What? I'm thinking about leaving the Army. I don't think it helps us to be fighting all the rules all the time... It helps them. What? The Army. It's good for the British Army to have you in it. It's what you were doing in court... Saving Joe Martin, and making them think very hard about what they should be. They need you. What was the second thing? No. Ed. Nothing. What? I'd leave you. If it would make you happier... I'd go. How do I look? You look terrible, awful. Thank you, darling. I love it when you call me darling. What do you mean "terrible"? - No! - Come here! I've got you! They lied to us. They lied and they lied, the world upside down. And then you did the right thing, Harry. And the world righted itself. Go out there, inspect your men. Tony! Come! The sun is going down. - Quick! - Yeah, wait, Yusra! Quick, come! No, no. Yusra! Yusra! No, Yusra! No, no, no, no, no, Yusra! No, Yusra, no, stay with me! Stay with me! Can you hear me?! No, no, no. Where are you?! Where are you?! Show yourselves! Shoot me! Come on, kill me! Kill me! Shoot me! Show yourself, you fucking coward! Shoot me! Kill me! Shoot me! Kill me! Shoot me! When you join this regiment, you commit yourself to working and fighting for Queen and Country. But these are nothing, compared with the deep understanding that when we stand together, as we do today, it is with the certain knowledge that the man you stand next to will die for you, and that you will die for him... And that is the promise by which we all live. Squad, by the left! Dismiss! Come on, Armstrong.
