   [NARRATOR] Far away, in an enchanted land that seemed untouched by the steady march of time, there lived an old master named Gohan who found a baby boy abandoned in the wilderness of the region. The old master raised the boy as his own child and marveled as the youngster grew and became uncommonly strong. Now the boy, known as Goku, is on his own, and has become the sole guardian of his grandfather's most mystical possession-- his Dragon Ball! [birds chirping] [humming] [chatters] Hi! Just hanging around, huh? [GOKU laughs] [GOKU chuckles] [GOKU laughs] Yeah! [GOKU grunting] [yells slowly] [struggling] [GOKU] Hiyaaah! [chuckles] Well, that takes care of that. I'm hungry! Whoa! [NARRATOR] Little did Goku know, a visitor was approaching his remote mountainside home. The young boy's life was about to begin a radical new phase. Totally radical! [sighs] Let's see here. Oh, yeah, there it is! [GIRL] You're as good as mine, you little jewel! [car engine starts] [GOKU] I'm going to go get some food. Grandpa, stay there, okay? [GOKU] This won't take long. I'll be right back. Huh...?! Uh. Golly, I've never seen you shine bright like that before, Grandpa! How strange! Can you do it again? You can wait until later if you have to. [GOKU] I'll see you in a little while. [GOKU] Now what should I have to eat today? Gosh, it's so hard to decide. Why don't you decide, tummy. Fish? [GOKU] Fish! Yeah! Ha-ha! That sounds really great! Alright! [laughing] [GOKU] Ah, but first, I'm going to need a little snack! [GOKU chuckles] [grunts] [exaggerated eating sounds] That was good. Arh! [LION] Huh? [growls] Hm? [roars] Missed me! [LION growling] [GOKU laughing] [GOKU] C'mon...! Catch me if you can! [laughs] [GOKU] You're almost there! [yells] [GOKU giggles] Uh. Uh-ah! [GOKU yells] That was great! [GOKU] Mm. There. That oughta do it! It'll be dry in no time! Here comes the waterfall! Huh? Hey! It looks like now is a good time to do a little tail-fishing. [GOKU] Come on, you little rasals. I know you think it's a giant worm. Take a bite! [GOKU grunts] Wow! That's what I call a fish! This oughta last me until dinner! [GOKU chuckles] [distant car engine] Huh? What's that noise? [yells] [screams] [BOTH yelling] [GOKU] Aaahhh! Yikes! Is he dead?! What the--?! Wow! You're alive?! Rrrgh! So you thought you finished me off? Well, you're not going to get my fish that easy, you big monster! [GIRL] Ahh...! Stop it! What are you doing?! [GIRL whimpering] [GOKU grunting] This is for hitting me! [grunts] There! That'll teach you to try to take my fish! Sneaking up on me like that! [GOKU] Well, I'm ready for you this time! Why don't you come out of your shell and fight! What's wrong?! Don't tell me you used up all of your power already, monster! Not quite...! [GOKU] Ow! Ooh! [groans] Uh. Hm? [GOKU groans] Holy cow! Whoa! What was that?! But... How'd you...? You shouldn't be alive, kid! [GOKU] So you thought you finished me off again, huh?! Well Grandpa told me about evil creatures like you. Your black arts won't work on me! Alright monster! It's your turn! Monster? Hold on! I'm not a monster, kid! I'm a human being! Just like you are! [GOKU] You are?! Uh, ugh... Really?! Yes! Uhh... [GIRL] Of course, I am! [GOKU] Uh... You can see that for yourself. Can't you? Look. I won't bite. Uh! Stay back. A human you say? [GIRL] That's right. Wanna to see my certificate of authenticity? [GOKU] No thanks. How long is this going to take? Will you hush up? Well, you look human enough. But you're different. You're thin and scrawny. I'm a girl, silly. That's why. A girl? Oh, so that's what you are. Oh my gosh! Are you saying you've never seen a girl before?! [GOKU] Nope! Besides my grandpa, you're the only human being that I've ever seen! Uh? But Grandpa told me about girls. He told me that if I ever ran into a girl, that I should be as polite as I possibly could. I see. Well! What a nice thing to say! Your grandpa sounds like a very wise man. Is he? [GOKU] Well, he was! He died a long time ago! Huh? Shame on you! What do you think you're doing?! I was just checking to see if you had a tail. Huh? Oh... [GOKU] Don't worry! Maybe it just takes girls longer to grow theirs! [GIRL] Ah-heh. I'm sure it'll sprout up any time now, kid! What a weirdo! [GOKU] How did you get that monster to do what you wanted it to do? That's not a monster, silly. That's a car. Oh, so this is a car. Grandpa told me about them but I've never actually seen one! [grunts] [GIRL] You know, for a little kid, you're really strong! Thanks! Grandpa trained me to be like steel. Hey. You were driving a car around, right? So, does that mean that you're from one of the big cities? You got it. Wow! Why don't you come to my house with me and I'll cook you some lunch. [GOKU] You can tell me all about the city you're from! Come on! Hold on! Just a second! [BULMA] It looks like the Dragon Ball is right down the road! Maybe it's at this little kid's house! [chuckles] I think it's safe to assume we're having fish for lunch. Well, alright! So what's on the agenda? Well, we can have a bite to eat and talk, then play together. Now look. If you think we're going to do anything improper, you can forget it! Improper? What does that mean? Oh, nevermind. [GIRL chuckles] I guess Grandpa hasn't told him about that yet! This kid's so innocent that he's adorable. [chuckles] Golly. Girls sure are strange! Well anyway, let's go. [GIRL] Sounds good! I'll just follow the giant fish. So, kid. What's your name anyway? My name is Goku. G. O. K. U. [chuckles] What's yours? Uh... My name? Mine? Uh huh. Bulma. Hmm? Ha ha. That's funny! Hey, Goku's not exactly normal, so there! [GOKU] Yeah, but it's not as weird as yours! [chuckles] Hey, you be quiet! Bulma happens to be very elegant! It's a lot better than Goku! That's for sure! Hmph! [BULMA] Wow! That's a nice little place you've got there, kid! [GOKU] Gee, thanks! Just wait here one second. Huh? Listen. What's up? Grandpa's trying to talk to me. But Goku, I don't hear anyone ta... [BULMA gasps] Oh my goodness! It's a Dragon Ball! [BOTH grunt] Hey! Give me my grandpa back now! Your grandpa? You mean this? Yeah! This is the only thing that my grandpa gave me to remember him by. Nobody can touch it but me. [GOKU] Look! Look what it's doing. I think Grandpa's trying to talk to me. What do you think he's saying? I hate to do this, but I don't really have a choice! See! What?! You've got to be kidding! You've got two Grandpas! No way! They're not Grandpas. They're called Dragon Balls. You sure about that? Definitely. I'm positive. Your ball started glowing because it was reacting to the two that I have. Look. Put yours down. [GOKU] Well... okay. But just for a second. [GOKU] Oh. Pretty cool, huh? Yeah, these gems have the power to do great things! And not so great! Let's just say if a bad person got ahold of these balls, he could really wreak some havoc! Well what do these things do? Sure you want to know? Yeah! M'kay... Ah, there it is! [DOG] It's awfully dark in there, Sire! [EMPEROR] Shut up, Shu! [EMPEROR laughs] Ahh...! Come to Emperor Pilaf, my precious! Yes! [shrieks] [PILAF] Get off of me you bone-head! Ewe! [bats chirp] Uh! [clears throat] Well, enough of that. I'm ready to make my wish! --[WOMAN] Sir? --[PILAF] What?! I hate to be the one to break it to you, but you can't make a wish with just one ball, you have to have the others as well. Mm! Huh?! [WOMAN] There are seven Dragon Balls, Sire! You have to unite all seven of them before the Dragon will appear and grant your wish! Hm... More searching. [WOMAN] But just imagine, dear Emperor, that glorious day when the seven balls are finally brought together! A beautiful burst of energy will light the sky, and in a blazing surge of fiery power, the Eternal Dragon will rise before you for the sole purpose of granting you a single wish. Whatever it may be. [PILAF] Yes! Yes! I can see it! Well, okay! I guess I can handle a little more searching. [PILAF] Any wish I want, huh? Well then, I want to rule the entire world! [GOKU] Wow! That's amazing! You can wish for whatever you want? And it will come true?! I wonder why my grandpa didn't tell me about any of this stuff! He may not have known about it, Goku. Not many people do. The truth is, you and I are some of the few people in the world that even know about the Dragon Balls or the Dragon. Don't get mine mixed up with yours, okay? Don't worry, that's impossible. Each ball has a different number of stars in it. See. This one has five. Oh, I get it. Grandpa's ball has four stars. [BULMA] Now you're catching on! [chuckles] I can't believe that I already have three of the balls! If I keep this up, I'll be able to wish for a boyfriend before the end of the month! This is so exciting! You are going to let me use your Dragon Ball so I can make my wish, right? You can forget it! Grandpa gave me this ball to remember him by. [GOKU] And I'm not going to hand it over, just because you're a girl. [BULMA] But your grandpa said to be as polite as possible to girls. Mm-mmm. Uh! Hey, I know what. Look, I'll trade ya. Uh...? You let me have your Dragon Ball, and I'll let you have a little peak. What do I care about seeing your dirty ol' fanny? It is not dirty, you rude little boy! Well, shoot. There's got to be a way. The hunt must go on. Hey, I know! Why don't you come with me? We can be partners. Whatd'ya say? Oh, go hunt balls? [BULMA] Sure, why not? You would get to see so many new things and learn so much. Your grandpa would be very proud of you. Really?! You think Grandpa would be proud if I went? Of course he would, kid. Seeing his young grandson that he raised venture out into the world all on his own. [BULMA] Learning all about the great cities, and crossing the desert, and seeing the ocean! Alright, that sounds like a lot of fun. I guess I'll go. This'll be great! So we're partners? Alright. But I still get to keep my grandpa's ball. You drive a hard bargain, but have it your way. [BULMA] The little kid's stubborn, but he'll make a good body guard until I make my wish. I'll wish for the most perfect boyfriend that ever lived! [BULMA] Well, here we go! The start of a great adventure! Hey, Bulma! How do we know where to start looking? The Dragon Balls could be anywhere in the whole world, right? [giggles] Just who do you think you're dealing with here, kid? I'm no amateur. Look--check it out! [beeping] Huh...? [BULMA] It's a special radar that tracks the Dragon Balls. Look. See these three dots? These are our three balls. And these are the other Dragon Balls. It looks like the closest ball is right here-- about 750 miles to the west. Is that far? Let's just say that it's out of our walking distance. And since you destoyed my car, we'll be needing a new set of wheels. Hmm. [BULMA] Let's see now. What am I in the mood for? Ah! This one will be fun for a while. Stand back, kid. Stay there. [grunts] [yowling] --Check it out! --Whoa! Bulma! How did you do that?! You're some kind of witch, aren't you? [BULMA] What? Nonsense. Witchcraft has nothing to do with it. Everyone in the city has dyno-caps. How could you travel without them? Hey! Will you knock it off? Just hop on. It won't bite you. [GOKU] I'm on. [BULMA] Okay! Here we go! Ah, aaahhh! Neato! This thing goes even faster than I can run! Yep! No duh, squirt. Get with the program! --[GOKU laughing] --[MONKEY] Huh? [GOKU] Weeee! [chatters] â™ª [BULMA] Chill out, Goku. You're squeezing the life out of me! [GOKU] Oops, sorry! [BULMA] Just relax. I happen to be an expert driver. I'm in total control... --[BULMA screams] --[GOKU laughs] [GOKU] Ah! Wow! That was great, Bulma! Let's go back and do it again. C'mon! That was so much fun. Just one more time. Please! [BULMA] I almost lost it big-time on that one. I need to be more careful! Hm? Uh, oh! Uh, excuse me a minute, Goku. Time for a pit-stop. Uh, okay. I'll come to. Oh, no you won't! Don't the words "pit-stop" mean anything to you? Stay right there! "Pit-stop"? What does that mean? [BULMA] I need to pee, you lame-brain! [GOKU] Huh? I don't get it. Why can't she just pee right here? How strange. [BULMA] Goku! Come here! Quick! [GOKU] Huh? I sure wish she'd make up her mind. Coming, Bulma! [BULMA screams] [TERANODON chuckles] [BULMA screaming] Who the heck are you, kiddo? My name's Goku. Are... you a friend of Bulma's? [TERANODON chuckles] [BULMA screaming] Yeah, that's it! As a matter of fact, we have fancy dinner engagements but the reservations are only for two! So... Gosh! I think he was lying. You're a regular Einstein! See ya! [BULMA screams] Hey, stop being such a downer, baby! I'm in the mood for a happy meal! [laughs] Hey! Where are you guys going, Bulma? Huh? Don't just stand there, idiot! Get! Me! Down! Well gee, I don't blame her for being upset, but she doesn't have to go calling me names. I'd like to help her down, but I really don't know how to fly. Hey! I've got it! Let's see here. How does this thing work? Bulma was able to make it fly a few minutes ago. [GOKU] Whoa! It's moving! Come on, whatever you are! I know you can go faster than this! We've got to get moving! Bulma's in trouble! [engine excellerates] [GOKU yells] [BULMA] Goku! Please help me! [GOKU] Hang on, Bulma! [chuckles] Yaaa! [BULMA screams] Hang on. Just a little further. Huh? Goku, help! [laughs] Boo! Power Pole extend! Here! Take this you mean ol' bully! [grunts] [screams] [wails] [groans] [screams] [GOKU] Here! Bulma! [chuckles] [grunts] Aaah...! [thud] [GOKU] Hm? Too bad. I really don't like to hurt anybody, but he gave me no choice. [BULMA] Goku! Huh? [BULMA] Aren't you going to help me?! Help! I'm having a bit of a crisis up here. [bawling] Be right there, Bulma! [NARRATOR] As Goku and Bulma continue their quest what will befall them next? The race is on as both good and evil forces plot a crash course! Who will be the first to unlock the mystery of the seven magic Dragon Balls?
