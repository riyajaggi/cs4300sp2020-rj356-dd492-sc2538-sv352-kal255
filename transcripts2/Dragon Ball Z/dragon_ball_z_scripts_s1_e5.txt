   Last time on Dragon Ball Z... Goku and Piccolo launched a combined assault against the evil Raditz! But in spite of their fierce efforts, Raditz easily deflected their every attack, and countered with an energy blast that sent Goku and Piccolo reeling! Having firmly seized the upper hand, Raditz proceeded to deal out a series of punishing blows! And the mighty Goku was rendered helpless as his older brother cruelly ground him into the dust. Time to die! That's right... It's Gohan! What awesome new powers have been awakened within Goku's son? The answer... Today! You? I don't believe it! Goku! Look over by the crater... It's your son! It can't be... Gohan? Gohan, Daddy can't get up right now. Run away from here! Run away! Gohan! Run now! Power Level 1370? Impossible for a kid! And, and it's still going up! Leave my Dad... ...alone! Whaaa? What the... G-Gohan? Uh, Daddy? Gohan... Go... Get out of here... But, Daddy... No one's ever done that to me! No... Stay back! Gohan, you have to go! Gohan... Quick! Run now! What? Hey, kid... What happened to all that power you had? Wha... What power? Bah! Play dumb if you want. You'll pay all the same! Daddy... Help. Leave him alone! Gohan! Gohan! Please Don't hurt him. He's just a boy! Yes, he's just a little boy, that's true! But he's very strong, and he has a power level even higher than yours, little brother. And if he ever learned to control it, it would be very bad for us. So you can see! I have no choice! He must die. Now. No. Wait... You can't... You are the first Saiyan to ever damage me like this, my nephew. You are a true warrior who is worthy of being a Saiyan. And so, I will give you a death that is also worthy of a Saiyan. Why, you wretch! I should have killed you! Piccolo! Piccolo! Your attack! Let's go! Goku, sometimes you amaze even me! Now, hold tight! This will take some time... And don't listen to anything he says! See? It never pays to tell a lie, now, does it? You little scoundrel! Piccolo! Hurry up! I can't hold him much longer! How could that little brat's attack weaken me so much? Kakarot! You're a fool! How do you expect to dodge that beam and hold me at the same time? Heh, heh. You're right, I can't. We'll both go! What? That's insane! You'll be killed! Is that what you want? If it's the only way for me to beat you! Hold on, Goku! I'm almost ready! So you're going to sacrifice yourself... Goku, how very noble of you. And how convenient for me. Then again, even if I do kill you, it's only a matter of time before your friends wish you back with the Dragon Balls... Too bad. No you don't! No way! Piccolo, my ribs are broken! Ah! Hurry! I'm almost there, Goku! Hang on! 1440! No! If that hits, we're finished! Hey! Kakarot! Look! If you don't let me go, right now, we're both going to die! What's wrong? You seem a little scared, brother! You're a Saiyan! Don't sacrifice yourself for these Earth dogs! It's nice to know that you're so worried about me! Prepare yourself, Goku! It's time! Special Beam Cannon... Fire! Kakarot! Aaaaahhhh! Curse... you! Kakarot... How could he? It makes no sense! The fool... Now we're both dead... No. You die alone. Goku won't be gone for long. I'm guessing his friends will see to it he's back within the week! What? That's impossible! Tell me... How? Heh. Gladly! On this planet we have something that we call the Dragon Balls. When all seven balls are gathered together, they have the power to grant any wish. And that includes bringing the dead back to life. So you see... It's Goku who will have the last laugh. No... I'm afraid you're wrong, green man... This device on my face... It's... It's also a transmitter... My Saiyan comrades heard every single word. The two of them... Now they'll come... I know they will. They will... I know they will... And once they arrive you'll be powerless to stop them. There's nothing you can do... They'll seek out these Dragon Balls. And they'll destroy everything in their path! You and every living thing on this planet will be wiped out. They'll destroy you all. When... When will they come? How long will it take them to get here? One year. And the funny thing is... They're much stronger than me. Stronger? One year? Oh, no. So enjoy this little victory of yours today. It means... It means nothing... You're as good as dead... I only hope I'm back in time to see it happen... Don't look so upset... We can't all have the last laugh. Goku should've been home by now. I guess he lost track of time, seeing all his old friends again... Still, I wish he'd hurry. It's not good for Gohan to be away from his studies this long... Oh well, I suppose it's all right this time. Gohan works so hard. He deserves to have a little fun once in a while... Come to think of it, so do I... ChiChi! Gohan! Hey Dad! Hey darling! I thought I'd come to see how you were doing. So... Where's my grandson? Gohan! I have something for you! Ha, ha, ha! Oh, dad! Okay. I think this is the place... They should be right down there somewhere... Thanks for the warning... We'll deal with your Saiyan friends just like we dealt with you. Goku... It's over. He's gone. Hey! Look! There they are! Oh, no... Only one of them's standing. Who? Who is it? Piccolo? Oh no... This doesn't look good. Even as Goku's friends rush to his side, little could they know that far away, in a distant corner of the galaxy, the events on Earth are being followed with great interest. Raditz stinks. He's a complete disgrace... How could he let himself be beaten by men with such low fighting power? I don't know. Maybe we should go teach those Earthings a lesson. A waste of time... Then again, I am curious... Oh. Are you thinking about what Raditz said? Exactly. Those Dragon Balls caught my interest. Just think about the possibilities, Nappa. If we can get our hands on those seven Dragon Balls, then we can wish for anything that we want. Anything at all. Wouldn't you say that's worth making a little trip? You kiddin'? Yeah! Let's go! You're going to make it, Goku! You can pull through! No, Krillin. He can! Can't you, Goku? Just tell him! Say something! Well, Gohan's still unconscious. But otherwise, I think he's okay. That's good... Goku... ChiChi'd kill me if he got hurt. Goku... K-Krillin... Please take care of G-Gohan for me... Yeah, sure, buddy. But! It's not gonna come to that, okay? You're gonna make it! And that's all there is to it! Krillin... No. Not this time, friend. This time I can't. I'll wish you back, Goku. We already have three Dragon Balls. I'll see you... soon... No... Goku? Goku! Goku! Once we've forced Kakarot's friends to tell us how to find the Dragon Balls, we'll eliminate them... Along with anyone else who tries to stand in our way... And then, we can wish Raditz back to life. No. That would be a wasted wish. Raditz was a weakling and a fool.. Any Saiyan who could be defeated so easily doesn't deserve to live. Actually, Nappa, I have something far more grand in mind. Now tell me, how does the idea of eternal life sound to you? What? Living forever? That sounds great. Yeah, and if we can't die, that means no one'll ever be able to defeat us... So what the heck would we need Raditz for? Yes, 'what for', indeed? We'll be the greatest fighters in the universe. And we will ascend to our rightful place among the Saiyan warriors of legend! Do you mean... That's right, Nappa. That's exactly what I mean. We will become Super Saiyans! Now I definitely like the sound of that! No! Goku! You can't die! You can't! He's gone. No, this... This can't be happening. I don't believe it. Look! He's disappearing! What in the world? I know... It was Kami. Kami? The guardian of the Earth. I think you both know him. Yes. This is his work... No doubt Kami has some 'special purpose' in mind for Goku... Do you think so? Although Goku has left the world of the living, it seems thanks to Kami, a bold new adventure awaits him in the world beyond! But as Goku begins his incredible journey into the unknown, the friends he leaves behind must find a way to carry on! For the time being... The Earth is without its greatest champion and a terrible new threat is on its way! In one year, two even more powerful Saiyans will land on Earth... Who will be there to stop them? The countdown begins... Next time on Dragon Ball Z!
