   Last time on Dragon Ball Z, Goku kept on running down Snake Way trying to find King Kai. Unfortunately, an unexpected detour lay just ahead. After hitching a ride with a street cleaner, he caught some shut eye, but a bump in the road sent him hurtling into the underworld. Unaware of how he got there or where he was, he got an even bigger surprise when he met two rambunctious ogres who were eager to play with him. But there was no time for games, and Goku was eager to get back on Snake Way any way he could. The ogres made him an offer he couldn't refuse. If he could beat them in a competition he would be allowed to leave... And sure enough, he did... Happy to win the grand prize, as well as steal some very special fruit that gave him some extra strength, Goku made a hasty exit. But as everyone knows, you can never trust an ogre! Sure, Goku was allowed to leave the underworld, but he was sent right back to where he started from... To King Yemma's house! Uh... hi there, great King Yemma! I thought you were on Snake Way? Uh, I am! I mean, I was! I mean... I should get going. Bye, bye! Hm. Goodness. How strange. Now Goku has really got to hustle if he wants to find King Kai and get that special martial arts training he needs... There are two Saiyans on their way to earth and he's got to get back before they get there! Let's hope that he makes it! Good! I think I'm almost back to where I was when I fell off! No-good hoodlum! If that guy doesn't slow down, I'm going to have to clean him off the back of this baby! Hey! Slow down! Holy cow! That's that same guy I ran into the other day. Boy, I tell ya, that guy should get a ticket for reckless running! While Goku gets back on track, on Earth, deep in the desert, Piccolo is focusing his powers and working on his own special kind of training... Huh? It's Piccolo! Wow! That's great! High atop Korin Tower, the other members of the Z warriors have gathered... Eagerly they await their first martial arts training session with the one and only Kami. I'm glad to see that you two guys were called up. This is great! I'm totally psyched! Me too! It'll be a treat! This training should be excellent! Nice crib! I'll bet the food's good! We're not here for a barbecue, Yajirobe! Man! King Yemma really knows how to grow fruit! I feel incredible! I might make it to see King Kai in time after all! Huh? Wow. Check that out. This must be it. This place looks like it's fit for a king, but it doesn't seem like anyone's home! Whoa! Man! Ahh! This is crazy! Ahh! Ow! Man! Summon the princess! A visitor just dropped in to see her! Excuse me, princess. You have a visitor. What? A visitor? Really? Yes, ma'am. What fun! It's been so long! Let's take a peek, shall we? Hmm? From what I can see, he seems nice enough! Let's get a better look... Oh, my! Ah...! Mmm, goody, he's handsome, too! Yes! I think I'd like to meet this young gentleman! Her highness has arrived! Whoa! King Kai's a woman? Uh, sure enough! And cute, too! Oh! My, aren't you bold! Oh, sorry, your highness! I came here to study with you, if that's okay? Look at her highness! I haven't seen her so excited since King Yemma dropped by a long time ago. Ah, what a hunk of a man! It's hard to believe a thousand years have gone by since he was here last! Wow! Really? Okay, well... The real reason I came here is to receive your training so I can help my friends back on Earth! Oh, training! I'm flattered! Alright, then! My goodness! Are you sure you haven't had any training before? Wow! This is kinda strange! So this is the famous martial art of King Kai? You're a natural! Next time I'll let you lead! How does that sound, to you, my boy? Hey, I must be doing really good if she's gonna let me lead... Whatever that means. Now I get it! King Kai is testing me! She wants me to find the vulnerable moment and try an attack! Wow! I didn't know King Kai was so weak! That's not King Kai... She's Princess Snake! She won the Other World Beauty Contest and she's known for her beauty all over the land and you must apologize to her right now! Gosh, I'm sorry. I thought you were King Kai. See you later. Oh, don't go! Please! Stay a while! I'm kinda in a hurry, Ma'am! Oh, at least stay for dinner! Huh? Dinner? Oh, yeah. It's been so long since I've been hungry because I ate that piece of King Yemma's special fruit! But it's been over three months now and I'm working up a pretty good appetite. Sure! I'll stay! Oh, that's marvelous! Girls, I want you to prepare a banquet fit for a king! Yes, ma'am! Apparently the Princess has really got the hots for this one! Yeah, I hear he's good enough to eat! Girls, it's been so electrifying having a man around that I'd like him to stay a little longer! Get it? Our guest won't be leaving! You'll make sure of that, won't you? Sure, no problem! I've got the very thing! I'll just grind it up and put it in the soup broth... And he'll fall right asleep just like a little baby! It's a little crude, but it sounds like it should work! All right, good! Wonder if this guy has a tender heart? I hope so... Your dinner is served! There's brazed crocodile head, sautéed paw of bear, Mussels au Gratin, and roasted turkey if all the rest of it doesn't fill you up! And of course we've prepared three types of desserts, so you be sure to save some room for that too! Wow! Ooh! Dig in! You can start whenever you want to! Oh, boy! Thank you! You guys want some of this? Uh... Should we give him more? Yes! Won't you have some of mine? I'm so full! You're full? But you didn't even eat! Thanks! I'll take that... And that... Ahh! Boy oh boy! Mmm mm! Hit the spot! Shall I prepare a bed? You must be sleepy after all that food. Well I guess I am a little bit... But I have to go. I really need to get to King Kai's place. We can't let him go to bed without dessert, can we? Uh, yes, dessert! Right! No thanks! I really need to go! Oh! But you can't go now! Yeah! You haven't had your bath! You better get cleaned up! Especially if you're on your way to see King Kai! That's right! King Kai gets offended by dirty people! Well I guess I am a little bit smelly... I'd better wash up. Ah, this is the life for me! Yep, it doesn't get much better than this. Hoo! This feels great. Hi there! How's the bath going? Fine! It's a little hot, but it feels good! Those are hot springs you're sitting in... The temperature stays at a constant three hundred degrees... Wow! That's strange... It feels like it's been getting hotter in here for the last half hour! Sunset program activated! A normal man would have boiled alive, but I knew someone as strong as you could handle it! Whoa! I just looked up and it became night all of a sudden! I guess I've been in here for a long time! I hope I'm not all wrinkly! Mm, look at that! All those stars! Can you feel the excitement In the air tonight? It's just wonderful! Tell me you feel it... Are you still there? Hm... Hey! Where did he go? Oh, no, I've done it! I've boiled him! It was too hot! Huh? Oh, my! Now that was refreshing. I can't thank you enough. That was embarrassing... But oh, my, what a bod! Man, I feel great! I'm ready to go! Goku, please don't go! No! Girls! He's leaving! Look sharp now! But I have to go. You don't understand... My family and all my friends are counting on me to make it back to Earth in time to save the planet from being destroyed! You can't leave yet. I've got something to show you... And it's my gun! It gets so boring around here sometimes, I just go crazy. So once in a while I pull out the ol' six shooter for a little game of chance. A game of chance, you say? Uh... Something tells me I don't want to know the rules. No way! It's a lot of fun, I haven't lost a game yet! You just use one bullet... Give the chamber a good spin... And now's the time that you place your bets, if you want! Five to one odds say you'll live! Place the gun to your head, then bang... You're off to the races! Personally, if I was given a choice I think I'd rather play checkers! Wait, weary traveler! Allow us to perform a sacred dance in honor of your family and friends! Yes! You can't miss the ritual dance of good family fortune! Oh, I guess I'll watch it. Relax... I'll make you some fresh-squeezed juice! Make sure he gets a special cup of juice. We'll put enough special stuff in his juice to knock out an elephant this time! Sounds perfect! Here you go! Fresh juice! Yum! Hey! Thanks! Hm? Who is this guy? How can he still be awake after eating and drinking all the drugged food? He's not normal! Goodness! He should be out for three days after all that! He's extraordinary, isn't he? Yes, I've never seen anything like him! And yet, he's so simple and sweet! Oh! I've always wanted a pet like him! Go... Gohan... Hm? Oh, I think he's dreaming! Quick! Bring me the Dream Mirror! Yes, ma'am! If you want to learn about a man, just watch his dreams! ChiChi, Gohan... Now I'm jealous! Who's this woman and kid? Well, it must be his family that he was talking about earlier! This one's far too tame for me! I'll just eat him! Please save us some! Yes, please share! We let King Yemma escape, but that was a long time ago and he's the only one that ever got away! Yesssss! Alright, Gohan... I'd like for you to do this next problem all by yourself. Can you do it? Okay, then can I go out and play, Mom? We'll see! Oh, no... Uh... Mom? Where's Dad? A-Ah... ChiChi? Oh! I was dreaming! I don't remember falling asleep. You fool! You said three days! Bah! Oh, man! I forgot! I gotta get going! Relax! I'm sure Chichi and Gohan are fine! Hey, that's strange... My wife and my son! Who told you their names? Uh... Why, you did! At dinner! No, I didn't! I would have remembered! Curse you! Stay away from me! All of you! Too late... You're already in way over your head! Oh, my dear, perhaps it's true that I wasn't able to deceive your heart, but your eyes, what about your eyes? Have they been deceived all along? You poor blind fool. You can't even see what's in front of you anymore, can you? Uhh... I'm... in a... A snake! You're in the belly of a snake! My belly, that is! Oh, and watch out for my digestive juices! They're hot enough to melt even the toughest of men! Man, I've got to get out of here before I turn into goo! Come on! Yes! Whew! That was close! Ahh! Sss, you rat! Ah... That does it! Ka... Me... Hey, wait! I can't! She gave me that nice meal! Hey! How 'bout we call a truce? All I really want is to get back on the road to King Kai's! I'll chase you for eternity if I have to! Whoa! I know! Gotcha! You! Bye! I'd stay a while, but you're all tied up! Wait! Come back! These men are full of fire, but it's not enough! Goku, we need you! For centuries, outer space has been known to be peaceful... Until now... On the outskirts of the solar system, two beings with incredible powers are on their way to planet Earth. And if they make it, they will change our world forever... That is, unless they can be stopped! Goku has escaped yet again from another dangerous trap and is back on Snake Way.
