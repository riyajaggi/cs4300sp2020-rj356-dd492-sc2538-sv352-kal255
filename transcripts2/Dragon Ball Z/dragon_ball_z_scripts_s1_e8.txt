   Previously, on Dragon Ball Z! With only one year before two evil Saiyan warriors descend upon the Earth, the world's most powerful fighters have little time to prepare for their arrival! Now in Other World, Goku has begun a 10,000-mile journey down the treacherous Snake Way in order to train with the legendary fighting master, King Kai. Meanwhile, back on Earth, Gohan's first day of training put him face to face with danger! Gohan has a long way to go before he can become a hero like his father, but even on his first day, glimpses of his true power shine through! Wow! Apples! Wow! These look good! I hope you enjoyed it, kid. That's the one and only time I intend to help you. If you can't survive on your own after this, then it means I was wrong about you. And you're just a normal little brat. Gohan's transformation continues today! Mommy? I can't believe those two aren't back yet. Ugh! It's way past Gohan's bedtime and he hasn't even called. And then Krillin comes over here acting all weird and everything... There's something strange going on. I just know it. If those guys think they can hide anything from me, they're crazy! I mean, what is Goku thinking? Doesn't he know this is the most important time for. Gohan as far as establishing good study habits? Goodness... All this worrying's going to give me wrinkles. Oh, man... What am I gonna do now? I couldn't tell 'em, Goku... I really blew it. I don't know where you are, Goku, or what you're doing. But it couldn't be as hard as this. I better get out of here... W-Wait! Where are you going? Don't you know Mommy said we can't play there anymore? Becky saw a snake there the other day. Great. Now I have to tell Bulma and Master Roshi that I wasn't able to break the news to ChiChi. Oh, I hope you're having better luck than I am, Goku. Ahh! That's bright! What am I gonna do? I'm never gonna get down and I'm still starving! Waaah! Waaah! Believe me. When your stomach rumbles loud enough, you'll find a way down. So, uh, how did she take it, Krillin? I didn't tell her. No way! Seriously? Yep. I can't believe you, Krillin! So what have you been doing all this time? W-Well, we started eating dinner, and it got late, and uh, they made me spend the night over there. You are going to march right back over there and tell them what happened! No! Anything but that! Well, I can't blame you. Why not? I just did. I know it's hard. Tell you what... I'll write a letter to ChiChi instead! Wow! I'm off the hook! Thank goodness... Okay, so what about the Dragon Balls? Like the two at Goku's? Tell me you still managed to pick them up, at least. I forgot! You're such a dweeb! Oh, boy... ChiChi, try to calm down. Okay. You can be like that if you want to. But I don't think Goku deserves it. He kept Gohan out all night and he didn't even call once! But, it's been so long since he's seen his friends. He probably just lost track of time, then decided to spend the night with Master Roshi. Well, he should have brought Gohan back... Gohan is attending school you know! Hey, come on. Goku's so good... When's the last time he got out and had some fun? And what about Krillin? Why wasn't he with them? They're hiding something and I'm going to find out what! Aaaaaahhhh! ChiChi! Slow down! I haven't pulled an all-nighter since I got out of college... There, I hope that did it. Let's see... Hey, guys! Let's go! I've got this thing working! Uh, guys? Listen! I have been up all night, and I am a little bit irritable right now! So... You do not want to get on my bad side this morning. Now, then... Let's try this again. Let's go, guys! Uhh, go where? Come on, stand up so I can try this baby out! This should tell us what your Power Level is... And it's... 139! 139, huh? That seems a little low to me. No, I'm sure it's a good rating, considering you're an old man. I don't know which hurts worse... the lousy power rating, or the commentary that goes with it. Hey! Check mine out! I'd love to know what my Power Level is! All right, you've got it! 206! Not bad! Oh wow! Hear that Master Roshi? My power level's higher than yours! Eh... That proves it. The gizmo's busted! Oh, you think? I know a way to find out. All right, Turtle. Put up your dukes! I'm going to check the calibration on this thing. Power level point 001. Sorry, Roshi. I'd say it's pretty accurate! Oh yeah! I'll be... Oh, cheer up. You're still stronger than me! Hello? Hey! I wonder who that could be? Come on! Open up! I don't have all day, you know. Now what kind of visitor could possibly be so rude? It's me. Huh... Oh yeah, I remember you. You're, uh... What's your name? You know I'm Yajirobe, you near sighted cue-ball head! I don't need any grief. I already had enough trouble finding this place. Anyway, I'm s'posed to tell you to go to Korin Tower for special training. So uh, did Korin send you? Hey, look at me. I'm know-it-all Korin. That's the guy. And he wants you to bring Yamcha. And Ten-somebody, and, uh, Chow-whatever. Oh, you mean Tien and Chiaotzu. Not me? Yeah, like I said... Get all those guys and bring 'em to Korin Tower... I'm training with you, too. What? No way?! Yeah, crazy, huh? I told Korin I'm not fightin' any stupid aliens, and he went through the roof! I thought he was gonna kill me. He's serious. Well, it sounds like we don't have a choice. You don't or at least I didn't. But do what you want! I'm outta here. Oh, yeah, I almost forgot... Don't wish Goku back to life with the Dragon Balls until the Saiyans arrive one year from now! What? B-But why? Beats me. Somethin' about special training in Other World or somethin' like that. Some lady named Baba's supposed to come by to tell you the rest. You can ask her. Wait! Baba's coming here? So... Goku's doing what? No idea... Hey, uh... Look. He's coming back. I don't know. It looks like a different air-car to me. Ahoy, there! Request permission to come aboard! Hello, my friends! Long time no see! Ahhh!! It's Ox! And he's with ChiChi! I'm outta here! Who's with me? No, it's better to meet life head on, Krillin. It's so good to see you, Master Roshi. My finest memories are still of when you taught me as a boy! You were a good pupil. But, Ox, I'm glad you're here... There's something I need to talk to you about... Alright, where are they?! I know they're here somewhere... And don't bother lying, either! I know something's going on! So where are they? Well, it's, uh, it's like this... A long time ago... You guys let that green monster take my son?! So you're saying that Goku had to, I mean, that he's... Yep. He's, uh, dead. Oh! ChiChi! Get the smelling salts, Krillin. Hey! Hello! Help! Up here! Aww. There they go... I'll never get down from here... Man! Talk about your long and winding roads! This is ridiculous! Oh, hi... Hey, wait... It's okay. I'm not going to hurt you... Here, it's okay. You can have it... I'm not gonna eat any more... Ow! That's not nice... Hey, where you going? He makes it look easy. But, still... I can't. I'm too scared... I hate this place. What's he doing? And I don't even know how I got up here... Hey, I have a shadow... But the sun's not up. It's night. Oh, wow! That's the biggest moon ever! It's so bright! It must be a full moon! I've never seen that be... Uh... Uh... Huh? What the... He transformed? This is insane! I don't understand! Why is this happening? If I don't find a way to stop this monster, there won't be an Earth left to defend! I've got to change him back! Wait! Do you have any idea what you've done? Your true power is gone now! Without your tail, you've lost your ability to transform at the full moon! The moon! They need the moon! Aaahhh! So that's the secret to the Saiyans' power. It's that tail! Somehow it gives them the ability to transform at a full moon. In that case, it was for the best that I destroyed it. If Gohan did this much damage, I hate to think what the other two Saiyans would have done when they arrived... Without the moon, they won't be able to transform. And we'll be on a more level playing field. In fact, we have an advantage. Because we know that their tails are a weak point. Which means right now, that tail is only a liability. There! Now, I guess you'll need some new clothes. And a sword would help. Now you can't say I never gave you anything, kid. The clothes are like your Dad's... But the symbols show you're from my camp. Alright. I've already done more for you than I intended. I don't have time to baby-sit you anymore. I have my own training to do. But if you can survive for six months on your own, you'll see me again. And that's when you'll learn the art of fighting the hard way! I'll teach you everything... That's right. You'll learn to be just like me. The countdown to the Saiyans' arrival continues. And the Earth's fighters are one step closer to being prepared. But for son and father alike, a long, hard road still lies ahead! On the next Dragon Ball Z!
