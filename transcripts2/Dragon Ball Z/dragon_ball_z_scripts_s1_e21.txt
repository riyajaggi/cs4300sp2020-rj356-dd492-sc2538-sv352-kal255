   Previously, on Dragon Ball Z! Gohan endured his most severe training session yet! And though the young fighter showed vast improvement, Piccolo wasn't about to let up! So you figured out how to dodge my punches and kicks... Now try this! But Piccolo's seeming cruelty was not without purpose. For the veteran warrior understood all too well... The enemy they were both preparing to face would employ tactics far more ruthless. It's a lesson the rest of the Z-Fighters had also taken to heart! To survive the battle against the Saiyans, they knew they would have to hone their fighting skills to their highest levels ever. And under the watchful eye of Kami, they did just that! Meanwhile, far away in Other World, Goku continued to sail through. King Kai's tests of strength with flying colors! And after months of difficult training, it seems the student has finally surpassed the teacher! Goku's strength and speed may have him running circles around King Kai, but the question is: Will his newfound powers be enough to stop the Saiyans? The time to find out is drawing near. The two evil Saiyans are on their final approach to Earth! The invasion begins... Today! Goku, this will be the last day of your training with me. You've done well, but I'm afraid you're lacking in one area... You still can't seem to deliver a good joke when the pressure's on! Everything else is good... Let's review! 'Kay... Bubbles, you're up! On your mark... Get set... Aaaand... Go! Whoa! Less than a second! A new record! Next... Gregory! Alright! Ha, ha! On your mark! Get set! Aaand... Go! See ya! Ha, ho! One-point-two! A-Astounding! Hey, thanks! Well, okay! Now it's time to test the Spirit Bomb! I've been waiting for this! Excellent. Now form it into a ball. 'Kay! Whenever you're ready, King Kai! Let'er rip! Hm. Alright! Here goes! Remember, Goku! Don't use your eyes, feel it out! Right! Suuuuperspeed! Oohhh! Yahh! Ohhh! I can't believe it! Well done, Goku! To be perfectly honest, I didn't think you'd be able to handle the Spirit Bomb so skillfully! It wasn't easy. Mm. Goku, you mustn't forget... The energy used to form the Spirit Bomb is gathered from all forms of life. From trees... From animals... From plants... Even the particles of energy that make up the air in the atmosphere contribute a small share of energy to the bomb. Therefore, you must be very careful. You see, you have mastered the Spirit Bomb here on this small planet. But the Spirit Bomb that you will form on Earth, with its innumerable life forms, will have immense power compared to this small one. And if the sun happens to be up when you form the Spirit Bomb, you will be harnessing and trying to control a power of indescribable magnitude that could easily destroy the Earth if even the slightest error is made in handling it. If possible, I'd like you to refrain from using the Spirit Bomb... But if you must, use it only once. Understand? Mm. Got it! I'll stick to the Kaio-Ken Technique. That should do it! Well, I'm afraid the time has finally come for us to say our goodbyes... The Saiyans will be arriving on Earth tomorrow. Baahh! Oh, no! Wh-What? What's wrong? I forgot to include in my calculations the time it's going to take you to get back to Earth on Snake Way! What?! But King Kai, I thought that you were just going to zap me back to Earth! What?! You've got to be kidding me! Right? It took me nearly a year to get here, you know! Yes! But, um... After your training, you'll be much faster! You should be able to make it back on Snake Way within two days if you go all out! No! But that means I'll get there a day late! It'll all be over by then! I can't do that! That's enough, Goku! I'm not perfect, now am I? Even I make mistakes! Now! Let's keep our cool so we can take the next step! Alright? You need to tell your friends to wish you back to life! What? Tell them? But, they're not here! Just put your arm on my back! Then speak to them with your mind... Your thoughts will get through, don't worry! Uh... There? Yes, yes, get on with it! Master Roshi? Master Roshi, it's me, Goku. Can you hear me? Master Roshi? Master Roshi? Master Roshi! Eh? Goku! It's you! But where are you? Well, it's sort of a long story. But I'm still dead, if that's what you mean. I'm talking to you with my mind from King Kai's planet. Can you hear me okay? Yes, I can. Great! Did you guys manage to collect all seven Dragonballs? Sure did! We're ready when you are! I understand that you've been undergoing some sort of new training? Yeah, that's right! And it's been going great! But I've learned all I can here, and it's time to come home. I need you to wish me back to life right away, okay? Those two Saiyans are going to arrive on Earth sometime tomorrow! What?! When?! Tomorrow you say? But that can't be! I mean, has it been a year already? Oh, this is bad... I know. And I won't be getting there until the day after tomorrow! Somehow the others are going to have to hold them off until I get there! Goku! Ease up! I-I'm gonna pop! Ah! Oh, sorry! Hey, uh, now listen... I'm not sure how this all going to turn out. But I have a feeling it's going to be some messy business. I hope you're ready. I am. Don't worry. Well, that is a huge relief. Ho-boy. Tell ya' what... I, uh, I change my mind, Bulma. You can go next if you want. That's okay. Hey, gang! Get the Dragon Balls! I just talked to Goku! King Kai! That was great! I could hear him perfectly! Heh, heh. Well, of course. They're going to wish me back. Ah, good! Well, while you're waiting, I have a present I'd like to give you. We can't exactly have you going into battle looking all ragged out now can we? Wow! New clothes? Hey! These clothes are light as a feather! Yes, I thought you'd like that... The material is light, but it's marvelously tough! It's incredible! Those clothes repel attacks, too... Small ones. Thank you so much, King Kai! Ahh! Check it out! You left the turtle emblem! Neat. Although I was hoping that since I've been training under you, I'd get to wear your symbol now. Y'know? Look on the back! Ahh! The back! What's there? I can't see it! Your old master's emblem is on the front, but mine's the big one on the back! Great! Go ahead! Don't just dodge! Get inside! Haaaaa...! Darn it! He surprised me... That was a reflex shot. I didn't mean to hit him so hard... Hey... You cheated. You said no eye-lasers. And what if I did?! You should never believe anything the enemy tells you! Yeah! But, I mean... You're not the enemy. Alright... Here goes! Now! Dragon, arise! Uh, I don't think I'll ever get used to this... Yeah, tell me about it! Even my nose hairs are standing up! What a storm! I've never seen anything like it! That's no storm... Ugh. Hands off, pig! Hey! C'mon, Bulma! I'm scared here! Why have you summoned me? Tell me your wish now! Yes, uh... 'Scuse me, Mister Dragon, could you possibly destroy the Saiyans that are on their way to Earth right about now? Hey, Oolong! That's not the wish! What about Goku, you little pig? What? We could wish Goku back! But why not wish him back next time and have the Dragon save the world now? Your wish cannot be granted. Because the guardian of the Earth created me, I cannot grant a wish that exceeds his power. Then I wish for Goku to be brought back to life! So be it. Your wish has been granted! So they've finally used the Dragon Balls to wish Goku back... Which means the Saiyans are going to be here sooner than I expected! Oh, good! Your halo's gone! You're alive, kid! Woohoo! It's time, Goku! Right! Listen! Don't expect those two Saiyans to give you a fair fight! You must be on your guard at all times! If things get rough, just kick 'em in the tail and run! That's good advice... And hey, I really want to thank you guys for all your help... I promise I won't let you down! Oh, and thanks for the new clothes King Kai! I love the new symbol! I'll wear it with pride! Bye, Bubbles! Gregory! See ya'! So long! Byyyye! Woohoo! That Goku truly does have some incredible powers... Not only that, but his heart is as pure as gold! It's hard to believe that he was living down on Earth. He's stronger than you now, isn't he, King Kai? Well, he has surpassed me in every area except one... I am still the funniest man in the universe! Yay, hey! Man! I feel lighter than air! This is great! Heh, heh! Woohoo! I almost forgot! Every second counts! Hey, Dad? Can we eat, please? Sure. It's almost lunchtime. What was that?! What happened? Who knows? Help me! Wh-What is it? It's got to be some sort'a ship... Wait, you mean, like, from outer-space? Ah! That's it! It's a space-pod! Remember that movie where the plant people took over the city? Someone call the cops! Yeah, right! What are they gonna do? They'll just say it's a weather balloon! There could be thousands of tiny aliens in there! There's another pod over here! Stay calm! Forget that! I'm outta here! Alien! He's getting out! No! It can't be! What do they want? My neck is killing me... So, the Saiyans are here. That means my Dad's gonna be back soon, too... Doesn't it? Wow... You feel that? Yeah. It's them... Without a doubt! After a year of waiting, the countdown to doomsday has finally expired! The Saiyans have landed! And unless Goku and his friends can stop them, they'll carve a path of destruction across the globe in their search for the seven Dragon Balls! Don't miss the explosive confrontation... Next time on Dragon Ball Z!
