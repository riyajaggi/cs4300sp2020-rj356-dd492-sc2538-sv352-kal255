Gohan's trials continued, as the creatures of the wilderness fought to capture him for a tasty snack. And it was all Gohan could do to keep himself out of their claws! Gohan's adventures dropped him into the dark center of an ancient ruin, where fortunately for him, he discovered he had some company... Who are you?! But when the ruins suddenly began to collapse, Gohan's robot friend threw himself into harm's way, and held back the falling rock just long enough for the young boy to escape. Please! Time to shut down... It's my fault... Now, alone once again, Gohan journeys into the unknown with a new determination to make himself stronger, so that the next time trouble rears its head, he'll be able to help his friends... Good luck, Gohan! The Saiyans arrive in one year! It's harder bringing you back than it was catching you! Ah, berries... Now, just a little bit farther... Ahh, yum! Uh oh, I better get back. Aahh! I can't believe this. I never thought I'd have to do this myself... I hope I'm doing it right... There we go! No, daddy! It hurts! I know it stings a little bit, Gohan... But I promise it'll help! No, I don't want any of that stuff! I want Mom to do it! Come on... That's it! You did it! Now it'll be better in no time. All right. Here it goes... It's the bottom of the ninth, the defending champions are leading the Taitans six to three... And it's the pitch! Strike! Murdock caught swinging on the change up! Oh-ho boy! You know he's gotta be hating himself for that one! You've got that right, Martin... And you can bet the intimidation factor from this man here had a little something to do with that little lapse in concentration! Absolutely! Rocky Rivers has hit more batters, and he's pitched fewer innings than any other pitcher in the league! Now those are stats you don't want to write home about. And the pressure has got to be mounting for that man. Right! Yamcha's already hit three solo homers, but how long can he keep up the streak? What's up, Puar? Gee, I thought you were snoozing! Aren't you nervous about winning the game? What's there to be nervous about? This is too easy. It seems like every time I step up to the plate I hit a home run. Yeah, but that's a good thing, isn't it? I'm a fighter, Puar! I'm not a ball player! Don't talk like that! Fighting doesn't pay the rent, Yamcha. You have to make money somehow! Rocky Rivers with the windup... The pitch! And Murdock's been hit! Atta' boy, Murdock! Alright! Hey, Yamcha! We got two men on for you hot-shot! You can bring 'em in, can't you? Hey, it's worth a bonus. Well, what d'ya think, huh? It's a pretty big game. The Pennant... Twenty thousand zeni... How's that for a nice bonus? It's hard to believe the entire season's resting on my shoulders. That's an awful lot of pressure... Twenty-thousand it is. Wow. That'll pay the rent. And there's the Taitan's slugger, Yamcha, in the warm up box... Tying run at the plate... Play ball! Two men on... Bottom of the ninth... Two outs. And look at Freddie Hines signaling in to Pepper Johnson. Bottom of the ninth... The Pennant at stake... You have to wonder with all the pressure if he even knows what he's doing. Looks like he's had too much coffee to me! And here's the pitch! Striiiiiike one! Johnson caught looking, or rather, not looking. And you have to wonder just what signal the Taitan manager sent in earlier. Here it comes, ladies. And here's the pitch! Breaking ball... Now Johnson's been hit! That's two in one inning! Boy, that's not going to go over well. Pepper Johnson is obviously shaken-up. I wouldn't be surprised if a fight broke out here. Hey! You jerk! You did that on purpose! So what! What do you think you're gonna do about it? That's it, meat-head! Come on! There goes Johnson! And now both benches are clearing! What a game! I've never seen anything like this, Martin! Not in a Pennant race! And there's the Taitan slugger, Yamcha! So far he's one of the few players that's chosen not get involved... He probably doesn't want to get hurt. Yamcha, stay out of it! You don't want to hurt anybody, now do you? Oh, Puar, it's just a little rumble! I'll try to be careful! Okay, have fun! Oh, my... You little punk! Hey! Hello! Krillin! What are you doing here? Y'know, just hangin'! I do have something I need to tell you though, Yamcha. Why don't we go over here? What? Are you serious? But, Goku can't be... dead. Yeah... he sacrificed himself. But don't forget about the Dragon Balls! Once we get all seven we can wish him back! C'mon, follow me! Hi! Oh... You jerk! Hey... Guys? Bulma's still mad about the time you stood her up! You should explain that you were just out of money. Huh! Yamcha was broke ninety-nine percent of the time anyway! Besides, he took Becky Hafford to see the concert three nights later! I had tickets.. You wouldn't go! Man! Being a jerk just comes so natural to you! Yeah? Well, I'd say I owe all my training in that department to you, Bulma. Krillin, if you need some help against those Saiyans, let me know. Wait a second! That's what I came to talk to you about! I do need you! Korin wants us all to report to him for special training! For real, Krillin? Well, too bad! You're gonna miss out! Hey! C'mon guys! We don't want to be late! Korin's waiting, you know! Oh man, that's sharp! Poor arm... It all looks the same... I don't even know how long I've been running... It doesn't feel like I'm any closer to the end now than I was when I started... Wow, I slept like a rock... My heart feels like it's going to pop out of my chest! Wait, I can't run away! My dad wouldn't run away... Besides, my sword's in there! Aaaahhh! Uh, actually, I can come back for my sword later... if you want. Goodness... That's gonna have to come out. Hey, this is gonna hurt, but you'll feel better when it's all over. Whoa! Poor guy! This was in deeper than I thought. This is something my dad showed me. It'll fix you right up! Trust me... You're not the only one... There we go! I know! It stings! But I promise it'll help! I'm back! There. I think that should be enough. Aaahhh! Great! Now I need to find more food for my friend... And I know just the place where I can get tons of berries for him. He'll like those! Wow! I haven't felt this good in a long time! There's going to be a fight, isn't there? That's right! And it's not going to be pretty. Well I'm not gonna bow down to those Saiyan jerks! We've got Piccolo on our side and Goku's gonna be back even stronger than before! That's true... And besides, it's not every day you get a chance to be trained by Korin himself! Hey! Right, Yamcha! Korin's training will make us stronger, too! We might be twice as strong! That's true! It's possible! In any case, those sorry Saiyans are going to have their hands full. I'll make sure of that! Wow! Now you're talking, Yamcha! Yeah! Oh great! She still likes him. Bummer... Oh! How romantic! You know... I wonder... Maybe after the big fella' gets better, I can keep him as a pet! That'd be so much fun. And it'd be great having a friend to keep me company. Can't wait! Ha, ha, ha! Wow! My arms are getting pretty beefy! Heh, heh, heh! Well, I have to try it sometime... I guess today's as good a day as any. Hmm... Maybe it's time I tested my strength out, too. My dad could make rubble outta this rock. Aahh! Hm. Not even a crack... I'm back again! I was gonna get you some berries, but I couldn't find any. Instead, I found a bunch of fruit I think you'll like. No! Somebody! Ah! Please! Help! So it's you! I'm not gonna let you hurt my friend! Let him go, right now! I mean it! Haaaaa... My sword! Gotta... keep... going. What happened? Oh no, my friend... The course of nature isn't always easy to accept. But as Gohan is learning, in the remote wilderness, survival of the fittest is the only law of the land. And difficult though it may be, sometimes there is little choice but to put the past behind and forge ahead! Don't miss the next exciting episode of Dragon Ball Z!
