   Last time on Dragon Ball Z... With the arrival of the Saiyans only weeks away, all of Earth's heroes were beginning to feel the pressure... Especially Goku... His epic journey to find King Kai was beginning to look like an epic waste of time. That is, until he summoned a final burst of energy and tackled the last mile of Snake Way... An unexpected turn caused him to slide right off the road, but at least it put him in the place where he wanted to be! Talk about your lucky breaks! Goku didn't know it at first but he had just stumbled upon King Kai's planet... The intense gravity of the planet sucked him in and he found himself face to face with King Kai... Or at least that's what he thought... Not wanting to offend the mythical martial arts master he began to train with the banana-loving legend... But in the back of his mind. Goku knew something wasn't right! Could this hairy creature really be King Kai? Alright, that's enough... Who are you? Hey... Are you... No, you couldn't be! I am who I am! Guess who? Go on guess! It rhymes with pie! Hmm... Huh... H-Hmm... Got it? I'm King Kai! Then who is he? Him? He's my favorite monkey, Bubbles! I see, I thought he was a little strange! Did you just call my friend Bubbles strange? Like you're not! Now don't take it personally, I'm only teasing you, son. Even Kais like to kid around! Yeah... Me too! Nnn... Okay, let's see... I'll try a few jokes on you. All right. Here's a good one, it's about my uncle... He's so large, when he sits around the house, he sits around the house. Ring! Ring! Ah! Yes, hello. You don't say... Wha? You don't say! My gosh! Heh. Good one... You're supposed to say, Who was that? Then I say... They didn't say! Get it? Oh, right... You're very funny, but actually I've come here to train with you, sir! Train you?! No way! Why should I?! Why you wouldn't know a good joke if it snuck up and kicked you in the head! Forget it! I won't train anyone without a sense of humor! Jokes can't kick you in the head! That's crazy! You're too much, King Kai! Well... On second thought, I guess I could train you. Oh, wow! You really mean it? Well, of course. But first, you must pass a test! Sure! Anything! Alright then... Make me laugh and you're in! What? Surely you have to know a good joke or two. But remember it has to be a funny one for it to count. What?! Come on! I'm not a comedian! Hey, don't get all tensed-up! Staying loose is the key! Trust me, you'll ruin your delivery if you're all stressed out! Well, I'm waiting! Knock Knock. Who's there? Krillin. No! Think! Think! Oh, having trouble are you? Then give up and go home! Why did the chicken... ...cross the road? Uh... to get to... the other side. Hey! No, wait... It was too far to fly! What's the difference between a jeweler and jailer? One sell watches! One watches cells! I did it! You laughed! You laughed King Kai! Somebody stop me! Hey King Kai, don't blow a gasket on me, okay! Oh, my, my, my. Okay kid, you're in! When I get through with you, you'll be a real prince of comedy! You'll have no equal in the art of delivering a punch line. They'll call you the Prince of Puns! How does that grab you? But... King Kai, I came here for training in the martial arts! You did? Shame on you! You should have told me earlier! Right! Show me what you've got! Don't hold back, I'm stronger than I look! What's wrong? It's this place... The gravity here... For some reason I just can't seem to get used to it at all. That is most unusual. Ah! I know! I'll bet you came from Earth, didn't you? Uh-hum. Yes, that explains it! I'm surprised that you can even walk around! You see, this planet may look small, but the gravity is severe! I'd say that your body weighs at least ten times more here than it did on Earth! Go ahead and try and jump... As high as you can! Ah! Bummer! This is really embarrassing! This one may prove to have talent after all... If he can jump that high in ten times his normal gravity, then there's hope for him yet! Maybe... All right, then! Let's begin the training! Now, how long do you plan on staying here? Well, for as long as possible, but I'm just not sure how much time there is left. See, it's like this! There's these guys... Really evil guys called Saiyan Warriors! And they're on their way to Earth to take it over! I'm here, because I have to get strong enough to stop them! I've got family down there! The Saiyans, huh? That's awful. They certainly can be a ruthless bunch! Mm-hmm. Okay. Heh, heh. We need to find out the exact day they're going to be arriving on planet Earth. Let's see now... Where are they? Ah, yes. There they are. Two of them. Hmm... I'm afraid they don't come any stronger than those particular two! All right then... According to my calculations, at their current rate of speed, they should arrive on Earth in approximately 88 days. Really? Are you sure about that? That's amazing! No, I'm amazing, my boy! Isn't it obvious? This poor boy has no idea what he's up against! Hm... You should forget the training... It's no use. That's good! Yeah? Hey! I've only got 88 days to prepare for the Saiyans and that's not good... Let's go! Aw! I'm sure we can get you trained in 88 days! You can? Training under me on this planet, non-stop for 88 days, is equivalent to training for several thousand years on Earth. Are you ready? Sure! That's great! There is one thing though... Even if you train, it doesn't necessarily mean you can win. The two Saiyans that are on their way to Earth rank among the greatest fighters in the entire universe! There are no guarantees... Those particular two, well, they're even stronger than me. What?! Stronger?! They can't be! I'm afraid so... That means in order for you to win... You are going to have to become stronger than me. Now I hope that doesn't scare you at all. Ha, ha! Good! Well, I say we get started! Hm? Hey! Bubbles, come here! Bubbles is used to the extreme gravity here! I want you to try to catch him! That's my training? Catch the monkey? That's right! Until you can move around easily, you're not ready to start anything more intense than that! Uh? Well, let's go. Go Bubbles! Run away! Run away! Oh, no you don't! Ow! This hurts! Man! This is tough! This oughta help! Ooohhh! Come on... Darn boot! Excellent! He's losing some of the unnecessary gear that's making him heavier! Now I'm going to get you, you little ape! Here I come! Rrrhh! You're mine! He's too fast! Aw, man! Giving up? Whoa! He's so fast! I don't know if I can catch him to tell you the truth. You're welcome to go home if you want! Oh no! Come to think of it, I haven't eaten since I left Princess Snake's place. Darn! Ahh, would it be okay if we ate before we continued? Well, I guess... I can cook, but you're going to have to do the dishes. That's the last of the bean tacos! Beans give me gas! You just ate a pot full! Wait! What have I done? Well excuse me! It tasted lousy, but at least I'm full! What horrible manners you have. You could at least show me show respect. You are a guest, you know! King Kai? I'm done! Thanks. I think I'm ready to get started if that's okay with you. Go on now Bubbles! Get going! You know it's too bad you're in such a rush to complete your training because it's such a lovely afternoon. There are so many interesting things to see and do on this planet! I could spend a day watching the sky! Heh, heh. And there's nothing like a little competition among friends! But there is one thing I love to do most of all... Drive my car! Aw yeah! Heh, heh, heh! Woohoo! U-Uhh... Well, what are you waiting for? Bubbles isn't going to catch himself! I think you'd better get moving or you'll never be able to get your hands on him! Don't worry he won't get away this time! Watch this! Wait! Hold on! Your training will be more effective if you put on those heavy clothes you took off before. Come on! Suit up! But I can't run in them! They're too heavy, they'll just slow me down! Well, I've got some bad news... Those two Saiyans of yours lived on a planet just like this... With the exact same gravity as here, too! So now you understand. It's one of the great secrets to their power. Unfortunately, that's not even the root of their power. You see the Saiyans are born with a unique ability to fight anywhere. It's much like a sixth sense. It's in their blood. Well, don't worry! I'm a Saiyan, too! Watch! Haaa! You're getting stronger! But you're not strong enough! Help me! Can you lend me a hand? Don't be a spoiled brat! This is going to take a lot longer than I thought if he can only fight at his full potential when the moon is full. At least after six months of training you're not acting like a crybaby anymore. Hey Piccolo, is it really true that you fought against my father a long time ago? Yes, but that fight's not finished yet... I have to take care of those two Saiyans first. Then your father is next on my list! You don't have to fight my daddy... There's no need to now because I can tell you've changed and you're not such a nasty person anymore! You're like one of the family now... Yeah, you're kinda like my big green uncle! You talk way too much, kid! Be quiet and go to sleep! Tomorrow's lesson is going to be the hardest one you've had yet! Goodnight. Big green uncle... And so the training continues... Back on King Kai's planet three weeks have already passed since Goku first arrived. Oh! I love dim sum! Ah! That's good... You dim sum... And you lose some! I crack myself up! Hmm? I wonder how Goku is doing? I've got you now! Hey! Ya hungry? It's snack time! No time! I gotta train! Ow! My nose! He's really starting to bug me! You crazy ape! Heh! Bubbles is all fired up! Ow! Hey! Come on, this car is a classic! Show some respect, would ya?! Oh, man! He's mocking me! Great! You're mine, Bubbles! You hear me? Hey, I have an idea! I'll cut him off over there! I'm gonna get you! Oh, Bubbles? La-la-la-la! Ooohh... Ha! Gotcha! Yeah! I did it! Woo-hoo! How extraordinary! He's conquered the intense gravity here! Perhaps he does have the strength to handle my training program after all... Yes... Maybe he is the one to finally stop the Saiyans! By catching Bubbles, Goku has gained the respect of King Kai. Now he can begin the next phase of his training. Training that will hopefully give him the strength and skill to defeat the two sinister Saiyans who are headed towards Earth. Goku has every right to celebrate after conquering the extreme gravity of King Kai's planet, but there are far more serious challenges ahead. The days are rolling by and it won't be long before Goku will have to come face to face with the two deadliest warriors in the universe. Will he be ready in time?
