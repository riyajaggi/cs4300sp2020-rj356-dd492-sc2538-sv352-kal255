   Krillin! Last time, on Dragon Ball Z... An uninvited guest crashed the party on Master Roshi's island. It was Raditz, an evil warrior from outer space who claimed to be Goku's older brother! But Raditz proved he had little regard for family, as he dealt Goku a devastating kick that left the Earth's most powerful fighter crumpled in the sand. And the worst was yet to come... Like I said... I'm taking your son. If you want to see him alive again, I suggest you listen closely! That's right! Raditz has captured Gohan! And with his young nephew now firmly in his clutches, the sinister alien has issued Goku his demands: Join him, or suffer the consequences. Goku is obviously no match for his brother's awesome power. Is there any hope for rescuing his son? Find out today, on Dragon Ball Z! Waa! Put me down! What's the matter, Kakarot? You haven't answered me... Let's try again. If you want your son back, I want you to eliminate 100 Earthlings by this time tomorrow... Do you understand? That's good. Do this little job for me and you can join us. But fail, and I'll see to it your son suffers a most unpleasant end. You coward! Hiding behind a kid! Yeah! That's right! That's right! You sicko! And besides, it won't do you any good! Goku isn't capable of killing anyone! Quiet, old man! Kakarot is a Saiyan. I think you'll be very surprised at what he's capable of doing! Of course, it will make no difference either way... Every living thing on this planet will be eliminated soon. After we've finished our current job, I've decided the Earth will be our next target. You... You what? Heh. Even without Kakarot, three Saiyans should be more than enough for the job. We could conquer this puny planet in our sleep. So you see, brother, whether you kill 100 Earthlings now or not, in the end the result is the same. Leave Gohan out of this... I wish I could, Kakarot... But you understand, I need to give you a little extra incentive to do what I've asked. Please... Let him go. Hm. Just look at how pathetic you are. Please, brother... Show some pride. You have until tomorrow. Try to enjoy it. S-Stop! Put me down! Put me down! Daddy! I'm expecting great things from you, brother! Don't let me down! Gohan! Daddy! Help me! Daddy! Gohan! Gohan... Goku! Are you alright? I'm sorry, but there was nothing that we could do, Goku. Nimbus! No! Goku, wait! You can't! You'll be killed! Do you really think you can beat him if you go after him right now? I've got to try! We need to use our heads! He's stronger than you, Goku! We're going to have to outsmart him. Easy! Easy! That's it... There! I hope Gohan's all right. Don't worry... If he wanted to hurt Gohan, he would have done it. It's you that he's really interested in. That guy's a beast, and... He stunk. Yeah, I noticed that. Me, too... I've got it! His tail! That's his weakness. Remember when someone grabbed my tail? It hurt... I couldn't move. Yes! Good thinking! What? That's crazy! He's not just gonna let you waltz up and grab his tail! I know. Which is why I'll need some help. Now, wait a minute, Goku... You don't mean, uh... Don't worry! Krillin and I are ready! We'll put that space pirate of business, won't we? Well, if there's three of us... I guess it's possible... Possible, but not likely! Heeey, wait a second... If anything should happen to me, you'll wish me back with the Dragon Balls, right? You can count on me! I'll do it! Wait, you guys... It's no use... I'm sorry, Krillin. You've already been brought back to life with the Dragon Balls once before... So has Master Roshi. So, that's it... If either of you die again, this time... It's for keeps. The dragon won't grant the same wish more than once. I know... It's risky. Wow... That's... a bummer. Yeah. You guys should just stay here. And let you fight alone?! Yeah! That'd be suicide! You think we're just gonna sit here while you go off to get killed? What am I saying? I'm gonna get creamed out there! This stinks! I'm too young to go! I've never even had a girlfriend! Hold on! I think I've got a way out of this mess! All we have to do is gather the Dragon Balls. Then we can ask the Dragon to save the planet! That should work! Yeah! Why not? Krillin, we can't gather all those balls in one day. Oh, yeah... That's right. Well, I say we go right now and attack him head on! What? That's the one thing he'd never expect. It might give us an edge and we need everything we can get. But, how are we going to find him? I don't know! I haven't figured that part out yet. Wait! I know! Gohan had a Dragon Ball on his hat, didn't he? So we can use the Dragon Radar! Look! You see? That's them there! Man, that's fast! Thanks, Bulma! Sure! Don't mention it! Look! It stopped! Well, at least they're not in outer-space somewhere! Alright, then. I'm going after him! What do you say, guys? You ready? Yeah! You never know! We might just beat that idiot! I'm in! Let's go! Well, whatever happens, you two should know that you're the best pupils I've ever had. You'll never succeed! You're too weak! Piccolo! Oh, great! What else could go wrong today? I suppose you could make me angry. But I wouldn't advise it. So... What do you want, Piccolo? Yes... Why are you here? This is my island! I've been keeping an eye on your last visitor. I followed him here. Oh yeah? What do you know about him? I know this much... The only chance we have of winning is if I go with you. I know we're enemies, but hear me out! You've seen how powerful he is. Which means you know as well as I do, neither of us have the strength to stand up to him alone. We'd be dead before the fight started... However... If we team up, there's a slight possibility we can overpower him. It's the only way... Agreed? I don't know. Why should I trust you? How do I know you won't turn on me? The truth is, you don't. I won't lie to you. My reasons for doing this are purely selfish... I could care less what happens to your son. But I won't let this guy take over the Earth... I plan to do it myself! If we team up... As much as the idea sickens me, I'm willing to put our differences aside. But as far as I'm concerned, this truce is only temporary. The next time we meet... ...it will be as enemies, same as always. And when that time comes... I promise I'll do everything in my power to stop you from taking over the world! But until then... It looks like we're a team... You've got a deal. Alright, then... Let's consider it done! If you can stand to work with me then I suppose I can bear working with you. But don't forget... When this is over, our alliance is terminated. Unbelievable! Bulma, we're gonna need to borrow your Dragon Radar. Huh? Oh... Right, Goku! Hey Piccolo! Think you'll be able to keep up with the Flying Nimbus? Yeah, right! Are you kidding? I'll be embarrassed if you can keep up with me on that silly little toy. Be careful, Goku! I don't know how to feel about this. I mean, should I be relieved or not? Wow! I still can't believe that just happened. It's incredible! What, seriously? Think about it... Those two are the most powerful fighters the Earth has to offer... And together they might actually win! I don't know! Do you guys really think we can trust Piccolo? I don't trust him. Oh, get over it, will ya'? This is going to be the fight of the century! Come on! What are we waiting for? Fire up those jets, Bulma! We're going after them! I think I'm turning into a clean freak... I guess I'm just nervous... I do wish those two would get back soon. That Gohan... I'm so proud. He's studied so hard to learn his math... Hmm... Maybe he should be a scientist. That bully. I hate him... Big jerk. A-Aahhhh! O-Oh yeah? My dad could lift that too, you know! Shut up! Stop crying! I don't know why you're so mean! I didn't do anything to you! Quiet! You fool! Be strong! You are one of the brave Saiyans too! Ahh! Put me down! Put me down! There! You can come out when you quiet down. Ahh... That's much better. Hey! Let me out! Don't go! Please! Come back! Finally... Now maybe I can round up something to eat. A power level of 710? This says it's within fifty meters of here! But where? What?! Kakarot's kid? Impossible! But there's no... but that's what my scouter's indicating. There's no way a boy could have such a high power level! Piece of junk. It's broken. Hmph. Faulty piece of equipment... Gave me a bit of a scare. We're getting close! We should land soon so we can sneak up on him! Forget it! It's no good! What? But we'll have a much better chance of winning if we surprise him! He's wearing a device that can detect our power levels. He can track our exact location! What? You're saying he already knows we're on the way? I'm saying it's very likely! Alright then! I guess that leaves us only one choice... We attack him head on! Next time, I'll cook the meat! This thing's still going haywire! And I didn't even bring the manual... Still 710! Piece of junk... What?! A power level of 650? No. There's two... One's 320 and the other's 330. Kakarot has a power level of 330, but Kakarot wouldn't be coming here... He can't beat me, and he knows it. Besides, he has no idea where I am. That's it... This thing is driving me crazy. I need to take it easy! What the... Kakarot is here! But, if my scouter's not broken... No... This can't be accurate! It is impossible for a child that small to have a power level of 710! I'm sure of it! Well, well, well. Look who's decided to drop in. It's little brother. Oh, and he's brought the green man with him. I was wondering who that second insignificant blip on my scouter might be. I confess, I didn't expect it to be you. What a pleasant surprise. I have to hand it to you, brother... I didn't think I'd see you 'til tomorrow. You're a little more resourceful than I thought. And more foolish as well. We'll see about that! Fair enough... So, what brings you here, Kakarot? Do tell... Have you already eliminated 100 Earthlings? I'm here to get my son back... Where is he? That's my Daddy! You are testing my patience, Kakarot... I've been more than generous with you, so far. Now for the last time, I strongly recommend that you join us! I don't care what you recommend! The answer is still no! That hurt! You should listen to your big brother. As far as I'm concerned, I don't have a brother! Alright then... You can have it your way, Kakarot. I didn't come here to kill you... But it seems you have left me no choice. It's too bad, little brother! I do think you would've found the life of a Saiyan to be quite invigorating! Alright! I've heard enough talk! You know why we're here! So let's get on with it! Huh? Piccolo! I had no idea you trained with weighted clothing, too. What? Thought you were the only one? Oh, yeah. I feel much lighter now. Hm... His power level's gone up to 400. There's thirty pounds... and here's fifty, and another fifty! And two little fivers! That oughta do it, Piccolo, unless you can think of something else. What am I, your tailor? Do you two really think that's going to make a difference? Fools! Who do you think I am? A few weights aren't going to affect the outcome of this fight! I'm still ten times stronger than you are! That may be true! But strength isn't the only thing that matters! Not when you can outsmart your opponent. You really don't have a clue, do you brother? You know what? I think I've decided I don't want you to join us anymore... A fool like you would only slow us down. You're a disgrace to all Saiyans! Now prepare to die! H-He's so fast! I've never seen anyone move like that. It's like he disappeared. I couldn't follow his movements at all! One second, he was in front of us. And then the next, it was... Well, I'll give you this... You know how to take a punch. Good... That should only make this all the more enjoyable. Oh yes... Let's find out how much pain you can really stand. I knew he was strong, but for his power to be that much greater... I need to find a way to grab his tail. That's the only chance we have! What's wrong? You look so pensive, Kakarot, are you still trying to outsmart me? Well, think about this while you're at it... Your situation is even more hopeless than you realize. If you think I'm strong now, wait until I catch my stride. Truth is, I'm just getting warmed up. What sort of monstrous foe is this that now stands like a giant between Goku and his son? And what are the true limits of his already unbelievable power? Even with their forces combined, it seems Goku and Piccolo have little hope of toppling this mighty villain. But will they overcome the odds and find a way to take him down? Find out, as the battle continues... Next Dragon Ball Z!
