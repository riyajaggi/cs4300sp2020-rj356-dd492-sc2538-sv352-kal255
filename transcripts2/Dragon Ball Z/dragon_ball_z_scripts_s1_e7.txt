   On the last episode of Dragon Ball Z... For this reason, we humbly ask that you allow Goku to seek training from King Kai himself. With the help of Kami, Goku was given permission to receive. King Kai's special training. But in order to reach this legendary fighting master, Goku must first travel the length of the treacherous Snake Way! How long is it? They say it's over ten thousand miles, but nobody really knows for sure! As Goku boldly set out on this new adventure, little did he know, back on Earth, his son Gohan was about to begin an adventure of his own. Your father and I barely managed to defeat the Saiyan who kidnapped you today. And we've learned that two more Saiyans, even stronger, are on their way to Earth... We won't be able to beat them alone... That's why you're going to train. So you can fight by our side! After discovering Gohan's hidden powers, Piccolo has decided to give the boy a crash course in martial arts. If Gohan can endure Piccolo's severe training for one year, he could be a valuable ally in the fight against the Saiyans. But the more pressing question is... Can he survive the first day? Um, okay, Mr. Piccolo. I guess I'm ready. Uhh... So, what happens now? What do we do first? Heh, heh. We don't do anything... You do. I do? That's right. The first thing you need to do is learn how to take care of yourself. If you can survive out here for six months on your own, I'll teach you how to fight. You want me to stay out here all by myself? I can't do that! It's too scary! Please, I don't know what to do! I've never been all alone before. Heh. That's the whole point, isn't it? Besides, you won't be alone. There'll be plenty of hungry wild animals to keep you company. You mean like, lions and tigers? But they'll eat me! Quiet! Crying won't save you! It's time to start acting like a man. Don't leave me. Please? You have to learn to rely on yourself. If you can find the courage to survive on your own, you'll be a stronger fighter, both in body and in mind. Remember, there's a great power inside you, waiting to be unlocked, but it's up to you to bring it out. Use it! Rely on it! And if you can do that, I guarantee you'll live through this. But... I'm afraid. You'll laugh at your fears when you find out who you really are! I know you don't believe it now, but you already have everything you need to survive. Well then, I've got to begin my own training. See you in six months. No! I don't have anything! What about food? Or a bed? What am I supposed to do out here all day? What about my homework? I told you I wasn't going to go easy on you. You're on your own. Uh... You can't leave me. That's cruel. Hey, guess what! Sometimes, kid, life is cruel. And don't you forget it. Hey! Wait! Don't go! Please! Come back, Piccolo! You were just kidding, right? Come back! Kami, what's wrong? You look upset. It's Piccolo. I can feel the evil in his heart, and yet... There seems to be a change coming over him, Mr. Popo. He's not acting like the villain I would expect. It's quite surprising. Piccolo would never have been willing to train Goku's son before. Yes, I was equally surprised when he agreed to forge an alliance with Goku in order to fight Raditz. I realize he had his own selfish motives... But still... That does not change the fact that he chose to defend the Earth, instead of allowing it to be destroyed. Kakarot! And though it may seem Piccolo's true evil nature revealed itself when he eliminated Goku along with Raditz... We must not forget, that Goku chose to make that sacrifice. And perhaps, his death was actually a blessing in disguise... For now, Goku has received permission to seek King Kai's training in Other World. Piccolo knows that Goku is certain to return, and yet he has still chosen to train his son, a boy that may one day grow to be a powerful enemy in his own right. I know. It doesn't seem to make any sense... Perhaps it does, Mr. Popo. Perhaps it does. Yes, Piccolo may have realized as I have, that in one year... We will die. What? No... I'm sorry, Mr. Popo, but I have foreseen it... I do not know the exact cause, whether Piccolo will lose his life in the battle against the Saiyans, or if I will simply pass away from old age. But either way, the result is the same. But Kami... My life force is forever bound with Piccolo's. We're two halves of a single being. One cannot exist without the other... Such is the curse of foresight. I'm able to see the day of my own demise. If Piccolo has indeed sensed my mind, he may wish to pass his knowledge on before he dies. Even if it's to the son of his enemy. Wait... What about the Dragon Balls? Hm. There's time for one more wish. Waaah... I don't wanna be alone. Somebody? Anybody? Please... Hey there... A-Ah! Hey! Wait up! 'Kay... Okay. I think I've got... Ah! I think I've got it. There you are! I'm not gonna find any of your friends in here, am I? There. That wasn't so bad, I guess... Now let's see. There's gotta be somewhere I can go... Oh hey, you don't know a place where I can stay, do you? Great! I'll just follow you! Wow. I had no idea Gohan was so strong! What he did against Raditz today was amazing! I guess he's a chip of the old block after all! Why do I feel I'm getting nowhere all of a sudden? I know! I may not be able to fly, but I can still jump! Yeah! Now that's more like it! I should have done this from the start! A-Ahhh! Then again, maybe this was a bad idea! Man! That's sharp! Uh oh... Whew! That was too close for comfort. I won't make that mistake again! I guess I still have a long way to go. Okay, now here I go. Okay, uh, now... ChiChi, you're not going to believe this but, uh... Goku is gone, and Gohan... Well, we sort of let Piccolo borrow him for a... Well, for a while and uh... Okay, how 'bout this way... ChiChi, um, guess what! Goku's in Other World with Kami, and Gohan, well, he's been kidnapped again! Oh! Krillin! Uh, hi. What are you doing here? I thought Goku was with you. Oh, well, he was, but uh... You know how plans get changed, you know... I mean... Hey! Krillin! Hi! Hi, Ox King, uh, nice to see you... Krillin, you're acting strange. Where's Goku? Right! Goku! Uh, well, to tell you the truth, he's, uh... He... What? He's dea... Delayed! He is? Uh, yeah! That's it! He's uh, he's running late! Really? So, then when is he coming back? Uh, well, uh... Actually, he's not coming back. He's not coming back?! Well, he is! Just not right away... Krillin! Just what in the world are you talking about?! ChiChi, now, now. Why don't you come in, Krillin? ChiChi's got some good dinner cooking. I'm so excited to see Gohan! I can't wait! You know, I haven't seen him in almost a year! He's probably all grown up by now! Aw, man. How can I tell him he's gonna have to wait another year? I just don't have the heart... So, Krillin... Where is everyone? I tried calling Kame House earlier, but there was no answer. Oh! Well, uh, there's no one on the island. Yeah, I think they all went for a ride in Master Roshi's boat! A boat, yeah. No phone. Yeah, that's it! Oh, that sounds fun. I didn't know Roshi had a boat. It's... It's, uh, new. Well, I hope he's having fun. Because Goku's got a lot of explaining to do when he gets back. He should know better than to keep Gohan out this long! He has homework to do! Hmph! Now, ChiChi, calm down. It's okay. Goku knows what he's doing. I'm sure they'll be home any minute. You're right, Dad. I'm sorry. You know me, though... Always worrying! Oh well, I better finish making dinner. Okay. Well, uh... I should go now. What? Really? But you just got here! No, Krillin. Please stay! At least until Goku gets home. That's right. I insist! But, I've got a lot to do! Not until you have some dinner! I wanna go home. Hi... I'm Gohan. Aaahhh! Somebody! Somebody! Help! Ah! Please! Wait. Where'd he go? I'm stuck! Can anyone hear me? Waaah! Looks great, doesn't it, Krillin? I hope Goku brings Gohan back soon. I'd hate for them to miss out! Ha! Goku can starve for all I care! Hamburger. I'll have the ribeye. Hold the rib. Thanks. Here you go. Here's your change. Let's see now. There's ten, twenty, thirty... You shorted me! He said, tell Master Roshi and the others not to wish me back with the Dragon Balls for one year. So, Goku want me to go down to Kame House? Yep! He said he'll owe you one. That boy already owes me plenty. But I suppose I'll do it this once. I don't know what that guy was talking about! He said I wouldn't have to worry about food, but I'm starving! I'm hungry and cold... and tired and scared... Apples? Wow! Two of 'em! Wow! These look delicious! Oh, boy! Now that's weird... I don't see a tree anywhere. Huh, well... These apples are sour... I miss my mom's cooking. I wanna eat a real dinner! I wonder what she's making tonight... Spoiled kid. Be glad you got that. Well, that's a little better... Nope... It's still way too scary... I hope you enjoyed it, kid. That's the one and only time I intend to help you. If you can't survive on your own after this, then it means I was wrong about you... And you're just a normal little brat. Gohan's first day of training was a difficult one. But this will seem all too easy when compared with the days ahead. The true hardship is yet to come! Don't miss the next exciting episode of Dragon Ball Z!
