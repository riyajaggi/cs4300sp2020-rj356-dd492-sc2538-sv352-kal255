And everyone, even Piccolo, is training twice as hard as ever. Not only is it a battle against time, it's a battle against themselves... But an unexpected storm has threatened to put an end to Gohan's training plans... All alone and lost at sea, Gohan is surely in for the fight of his young life... That is, if he survives... Who is he? He doesn't look like he's from around here. I dunno... He must have fallen off a ship or something... Well, don't get too close, he could be dangerous! He won't wake up! Is he alive? I'd better check! I guess not. Too bad. Oh no... How can you tell, Rom? What did you do? The old ear test! You mean you're six years old and you haven't heard of the ear test before? Yes I have! Hmm. It doesn't look like he has anything valuable on him. Hey, look, Rom! What's that? Oh, wow! A sword! Cool! Check it out! Hey... That's my sword... I guess he's dead again. Keep it on, Rom! He's waking up! Is he? You're right! Hello there! Hi. How's it going? I'm Rom! And my name is Chiko! Hi! Hi. Where am I? Here! Where's here? Here is wherever we happen to be at the time. Oh, cool... It's great, isn't it? This is our house. It's free because no one wants it... Where'd you come from anyway? I don't know... I think it was a desert or something. Oh, wow. I can't believe you're all alone! Not anymore! From now on you can hang out with us! We're orphans too! What? We only have one rule, never cry. But Chiko breaks that rule all the time, so don't worry... I do not! I'm Gohan. It's nice to meet you, Gohan. Don't believe everything that Rom tells you though, okay? Y'know, You're the first new orphan ever. The rest of us have been together since the tidal wave! Say whatever's on your mind, Gohan. We speak freely around this place. That's good! It's just that I've been alone for so long... I forgot how to talk. There was a huge tidal wave about two years ago... Boy, when it hit, it wiped out the whole town! It was so scary! That why there's a lot of kids around here without families or homes to go to. That's the place, right up ahead there! Um? I'm not a... It's the goon squad! Let's go! Right! What's up? Gohan! Let's go! C'mon! Right! C'mon, Gohan! You're gonna get caught! They're not back there! Hm? C'mon! I'll be right back. I'm gonna get Chiko across! He's a goner. Give it up, kid! There's nowhere to go! You're coming with us! Hey! Wooaah! Take that! You big apes! Grr! Those little brats! C'mon! Huh? Uh, who are those guys? They're from the home, where kids get spanked and yelled at! They put us in a pen if we're caught, and they'll treat us like animals! Sounds terrible! If they get you, there's no escape. You'll have to spend the rest of your days working for 'em doing chores in the home! Well, not me! I'll hide from them... I will! They've found us now... They'll come back! Oh no... Be quiet! Come on! Noo! Aahh! Why, you little brat! Pigero! That's enough outta you clowns! The girl stays! That's what you think! Chyeaah! Yaahh! Haah! That's enough now! We're not here to hurt you children! We just want to take you to a place where you can have new clothes, and hot meals and a bed to sleep in. Hear that? C'mon, she's lying, dummy! We don't want all of that stuff! Just leave! What about the other children? The small ones! Maybe some of them want a home to live in? We all had homes before the tidal wave hit! If you really want to give us nice things, that's fine! Just bring 'em over here. We'll be back! We did it! All right! Is he new? Yeah, he is. He was shipwrecked and we found him on the beach. Hi, I'm Gohan! Nice to meet you! And since he's the smallest, he gets food everyday now! Nope! You're still the smallest, Chiko. Hi, Gohan, my name's Pigero. It's nice to meet you. Come on, Yudon! You can take him! Step right up, ladies and gentlemen, I've got the freshest goods in town! These are the juiciest, son! Oh, the poor boy! Let's go! Hey! You rotten kids! I'll get you! Curses! They went that way! Faster, Rom! Faster! Stop, you thieves! I Said stop! Oh my! Oh yeah! I'll get you kids for this! That was fun, wasn't it? Yeah! Who needs parents? We sure don't! You bet! We do just fine! We're a family now! Isn't that great? Yeah, sure. I remember that tidal wave like it happened yesterday. Hey, Gohan! What's up? Hey, what are you doing up so late? I'm on guard! Sometimes the workers from the home come at night. I do night duty ever since Rom nodded off and fell out of the tree. So what's up with you? You must have something on your mind if you're up this late. Well, I'm not really an orphan. When I was shipwrecked, I was on my way home to see my mom. Hmm. I see. Oh, so you do have a home? Sorry, you guys. I just couldn't say it. Hey, don't worry about it, it's cool. Yeah, I really didn't give you the chance to tell us. So, where is your house? Uh, it's right by Mt. Paoz in the forest. Hey, that's just a little ways inland from here. Wow! Seriously? Hey, if you know where it is, can you show me? No problem, I'll take you over there tomorrow. Man! Thank you! Hey, so what's your mom like, Gohan? Well, she's sweet and she's pretty, but she's really into making me study a lot. I guess I could study if I had to. No way! Not me! Oh, it's not that bad! You get to play some. Oh, wow, really? Yeah, not enough, though. But it's better than nothing! You know, all of these big cities are only a hundred years old. Before that, kid's didn't even have to go to school, they just worked on a farm. Wow, cool! Yeah! Yeah, lots of people never went to school! That must have been cool. To just live on the land before all this junk was built. I hear ya... We could've done things differently. What would we do differently? Well, for starters, we'd set aside a beautiful place for orphans. Yeah, and we wouldn't be too busy to spend time with them! No cars and highways! Nope! Except ice cream trucks, those are okay! Hey, what do you say we all drive to Gohan's house tomorrow and drop him off! Yay! That's great! But how are we gonna do that? I have a plan! Listen up. No sign? Not yet! They're late today. Maybe they've finally given up... Hey! Here they come! Places everybody! Sorry! Hurry up! Police! Scramble! Alright, kids, it's over! Chiko? Now what, hotshot? Haah! Haah! Pigero, you're our hero! What about the other children? Maybe some of them would like a home to live in! Come on! Let's go! But, the others! Never mind! Noo! Come back! Pigero! Pigero! Hey, Pigero! Why! Why did you leave them? You were their hero! Why? You don't understand! I didn't have a choice! I can't take care of them! They need more than I can give 'em! Those kids need a real home! Later! You're one bad dude, for real. Keep it up! Where will you go? I don't know! There's a whole world out there! Take care of that mom of yours! See ya! Thank you, Pigero! I hope we meet again someday! Home! Here I come! Mom... So what's your Mom like, Gohan? I think it's great that you have a home! Keep it up, huh? There's a whole world out there! Gohan... What is your mission? Say it! To prepare for the Saiyans! To fight! And to beat them! Then let's go back! Right! That's the way, Gohan! This isn't the time for a family reunion because danger is approaching fast! The two Saiyans are getting close and you have to be ready. There's no telling what kind of damage they will inflict on the Earth.
