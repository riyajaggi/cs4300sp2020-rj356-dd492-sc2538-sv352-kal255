   Last time, on Dragon Ball Z... With no more battles to fight, Goku had settled into a peaceful life with Chichi and his new son! I'm Gohan. But peaceful though it may be, life in the countryside is anything but quiet! The woods can be a dangerous place for a young boy alone. Fortunately for Gohan, his father is one of the strongest men in the world! And Goku was there in the nick of time to pull his son from harm's way. But even as father and son braved the perils of the woods, little did they know, a far greater threat was descending upon the Earth! An alien spacecraft fell from the skies, carrying aboard an unexpected, and most unwelcome, visitor. Piccolo was the first to meet this mysterious invader face-to-face. And the extent of the alien's power was revealed. Despite being one of the mightiest fighters on Earth, Piccolo's awesome energy attack had little effect. You actually managed to singe one of my leg hairs. Impressive! Though powerless to defend himself against this foe, Piccolo's life was spared when the alien sped away to continue his search... A search for a man named Kakarot... You are a discredit to your race, Kakarot! But when I find you I'll teach you what it means to be a Saiyan! Kakarot!! Hello! Hey, you guys! Hey! Bulma! Wow! It sure has been a long time, hasn't it? Yep! But look at you! You're as beautiful as ever! Oh, you men... You're impossible! I guess you forgot about my truffles, though. Oh well, that's okay. I'll forgive you. Surprise! Aahh! See? I didn't forget! Heh! Goodness, you're gonna spoil this old man. I'm so happy right now. Heh! I could just squeeze ya! Hey, I was just trying to say thanks! Why did I think he could ever change? Whoa-ho-ho! Oh, wow! Yay! Hey so, eh.. What's Yamcha been up to these days, Bulma? Oh that idiot! I don't even want to think about him! He made me so mad, I didn't even tell him we were going to be here today! I never want to see him again! We're finished! I mean, can you believe it? He went out with another girl! Breaking up is hard to do. I wouldn't know... So, where's Goku at? Well, he said he was gonna be here. I guess he's on his way. Wow... Hey, Krillin, leave me some! This power moves with great speed! But not fast enough... Here we are, Gohan! Kakarot! You cannot escape me! Hey! Is anyone home? Hm? It stopped! Goku! Hi! Hey, who's the kid? You tryin' to earn some extra cash babysitting, or somethin'? He's my son. Your son? Pretty wild, huh? Wow... Oh Goku, he's adorable! Gohan, say hi. Hello, everyone. -Hi! -Oh, hello! This is Gohan. Gohan? I see... You named him after your grandfather, did ya? Well, that's wonderful. He's a fine looking boy. I'm sure your grandpa would have been very proud. Hey Gohan. How old are you? Um, uh, four and a half. Are you gonna grow up to be a brave fighter like your dad? Well, ChiChi doesn't let him train. Huh? Oh... No martial arts, huh? So what do you want to be when you grow up, Gohan? An orthopedist. Wow, uh... An orthopedist, huh? He's just saying hi, Gohan. Hm... A tail. Yeah! He was born with it, just like me! I think he wants you to pet him, Gohan. Oh, man! Goku, has anything, you know, strange ever happened to Gohan at night? What do you mean? She means, has Gohan ever looked at the moon at night? When it's full? I don't think so... No... We all go to bed pretty early. Uh, why? Wh-Why, you say? Oh, no reason... Heh, heh, heh! Uh, no particular reason at all! Well, uh... He sure seems a lot different than you were when you were a kid, Goku. I know. ChiChi can be pretty overprotective when it comes to Gohan. She makes him study all the time, and she says martial arts are a waste of energy. Three... Go! Oh, yeah? Then what does that make us, then? Now, now. Settle down boys. You can't expect everyone to agree with what you're doing. It would be all too easy, then! Watch out! He might pinch you, Gohan! That crab's a mighty sore loser! Oh, how neat. That's a real Dragon Ball on your hat, isn't it? Isn't it? Yep. The four-star ball. It took me a while to find it, but I wanted Gohan to have it since it used to belong to my grandfather. I've been collecting Dragon Balls for fun. I've got the three-star ball, and the six-star ball too. They're at home. Wow. You know, it's wild to think of all the crazy adventures we used to have trying to find those things. Yeah, really... So, Goku, what are you guys gonna wish for when you get all seven? I don't know, Krillin. That's a good question. Come to think of it, I don't really want anything. -Whoa! -Oh, wow! I thought Goku had less power now that he settled down. You're still one bad dude, Goku! What is it? What, Goku? There's something bad heading straight for us... What? Are you sure, Goku? I'm positive. I've never felt a power like this before. Yeah, I feel it now, too... There's nothing there, you guys. What is it? I've never sensed anything like this before. Such an... An awful power! Look! There! Oh, yes! I see it, Goku! Who is that? It's not Piccolo, is it? This isn't good. I smell death in the air. So, we meet again at last... You've grown up. I recognize you, though, Kakarot. Kak-a-rot? That's right. That's your name. His name? Who is this? You must be nuts. Kakarot! What have you been doing here all these years? Your mission was to terminate all life on this planet! Why haven't you carried it out? Listen, mister... I don't know who you are, but you've obviously got the wrong guy! Shoo! Shoo! I think you've been dippin in the egg nog. Allow me to escort you off this the island. Krillin, watch out! Krillin! Ahh! A tail? I don't believe it! He's got a tail, too! That's good. I wondered how long it would take you to recognize me. What are you... I... I've never seen you before! Gohan! Kakarot! You mean to tell me you have no idea who I am? I don't know who this 'Kakarot' person is you're looking for, but I'm not him! My name's Goku! What happened to you? Ah! Gohan! No! Daddy! Gohan, get back! Kakarot! Tell me... Did you ever suffer a serious injury to the head when you were young? What? When you were a kid did you ever hit your head? Gohan! Did you hear me?! Yeah! I don't remember it very well, but you're right, I did hit my head when I was a child. I still have a scar where it happened. You stupid fool.. You forgot! I forgot what? Tell me! Goku? There's something... Something your grandfather once told me that I think you should know... Long ago, your grandpa Gohan was walking through the woods when he came upon a crater that had been recently made in the ground. When he went to examine it more closely, he found what appeared to be some sort of spaceship. And next to it... There you were. Lying in a little round pod. Gohan tried to take care of you, but you were wild, downright uncontrollable, and unusually powerful for a baby. You wanted nothing to do with Gohan's kindnesses. Then one day, there was a terrible accident... You fell into a deep ravine and badly injured your head. Your grandfather feared that he had lost you. But somehow, miraculously, you survived. Yes, any other child would have died, but you recovered. And from that day on, you became a happy, loving boy. I'm from outer space? Yes. Well, that would explain a lot... So you think Goku has some connection with this guy? I wish I knew... Okay. You've got my attention. Now tell us who you are! Well, I wasn't expecting to give a history lesson when I came here today... But all right... I'll tell you everything. After all, you are going to be working for me from now on, and I do like my subordinates to be well informed. Hey, Krillin... You alright? Yeah, be careful Goku. This guy's not normal. Mm-hm. Believe me, I know... I could sense that from the minute he landed. Even now, standing here talking to him like this... Something about him turns my stomach. Such harsh words... Careful. You're more like me than you realize. You were born on the planet Vegeta... You are a space fighter, a Saiyan warrior... Just like me. Wha? Goku... Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Raditz... Your big brother. Goku has a... a brother? Goku... He looks like you! Why should I believe you? Yeah, that's right! What the heck is Goku doing on Earth if he's from another planet? That's simple... We sent him here. Kakarot was given specific orders to clear this world of its current inhabitants... A mission which he has failed miserably. You see, we Saiyans are sort of like... Planet brokers. We scour space for planets that will bring a high price on the galactic market. Once we find them, we send our warriors there to purge them of any life and make them ready for sale. It's a very, very profitable business. And we take great pride at being efficient in our work. For example, if we discover a planet with strong inhabitants, we send a team of our adult fighters to wipe them out. But for planets full of weaklings like this one, one of our babies is generally sufficient to carry out the order. If what you say is true, you Saiyans are just an abomination! You're space pirates! That's what you are! How can you send little babies off into space all alone? Trust me, they're more than capable of looking after themselves... Well, most of them. Kakarot, you're a disgrace! You could have easily wiped out every living thing on this planet by yourself. If you hadn't forgotten your orders, it would have only have taken you a year or two at the most. Especially considering this planet has a nice, big moon. Yeah, lemme guess, I was probably supposed to blow that up, too... You fool! You know as well as I do, it's the key to unlocking your true potential! I'm sure at least once in your life you've looked at the full moon... I don't know what you're talking about. Ah! Aaahh! Wh-What happened to your tail, Kakarot? My tail? Why? Answer me! Now! It was removed permanently a long time ago! Do you have any idea what you've done? Your true power is gone now! Without your tail, you've lost your ability to transform at the full moon! Now I can see how you can be on good terms with these weaklings... Listen! This is my home! And these are my friends! So it doesn't matter what you say I am! And you sure don't act like any brother I'd wanna have. My name is Goku and I live here! Now leave us alone! Yeah! Just go! Even if you are brothers, that doesn't mean Goku has to destroy peaceful planets like you do, you big creep! Right! Goku even saved this planet once, mister! So, go away! So baby brother wants to be left alone... Well, it's a pity that's not going to happen. No, at this point I'm afraid you're far too valuable to us for that... You see, three years ago, our home planet, Vegeta, met with an unfortunate accident when a huge comet slammed into its surface. The planet was vaporized and the Saiyan race destroyed. There's not too many of us left now, brother. In fact... As far as we can tell, there are only four... including you. We were the only Saiyans away from home when the planet exploded... Like you, the rest of us had been sent off to perform a few 'hostile takeovers.' And now we've found another world we'd like to conquer. It should bring in a very high price. But unfortunately, the job's a little too big for only three of us to handle. We were almost afraid we'd have to pass it up... Until I remembered you, Kakarot. You're not as powerful as I might have hoped, but still, with your help we should manage nicely. Well now, what do you think? Are you excited? You should be... I've come to take you back into the fold. I've heard enough! I'd die before I'd join a gang of pirates like you! Interesting. I have been meaning to ask you, Kakarot... I couldn't help but notice your son has a tail. Leave him out of this! I'll decide that! If you won't join us... I suppose I'll just have to settle for taking the boy in your place. Goku? We'll see... Hya! I see the fire in your eyes, brother. You should come with us! It's in your blood... You love to fight. Now... I'm right here with you, Goku. Just stay close to Gohan. Watch him, Goku... Ah! Daddy! -Goku! -Are you okay? Gohan, no! Hey! Like I said... I'm taking your son... If you ever want to see him alive again, I suggest you listen closely! Come on Goku. You have to get up! Now then, I'll give you one day to think about my offer. Although, let's be realistic, Kakarot. I'm not giving you a choice. So, when you decide to join us and you will... There's something I want you to do... Prove to me that you mean it... You can start by eliminating 100 of these pathetic earthlings. Just stack them here on the beach when you're done. I'll be back tomorrow for a head count. So what do you say, Kakarot? I do hope you'll come through for me on this one. After all, he's my nephew. It would be a shame if I had to hurt him. Aahh! Help, daddy, I'm scared! Aaahh! G-Gohan... Aahh! Help me! Aahh! The unthinkable has happened... Gohan has fallen into the clutches of the evil Raditz! And against his older brother's incredible strength, is there anything Goku can do to rescue his son? The outlook is grim, in the next episode of Dragon Ball Z!
