The two Saiyans, the strongest fighters in the universe, continued their intergalactic journey towards Earth... Their goal, torment the population and wreak havoc on the planet... That is unless Goku and the other Z warriors can stop them... But they'll have to move fast because time is running out. Oh man, how far does this road go on? It seems like there's no end to it at all. I've been running for days and days... I hope this is worth it because it's been almost a year now and I still haven't found King Kai! Hang in there Goku, remember you've got Gohan and on your side. And right now he's being trained by Piccolo, who is a great martial artist in his own right! Haaa! Piccolo's methods may seem a little rough but compared to what the Saiyans will do, this training session is a walk in the park. If Gohan can master these new fighting skills in time, Earth still might have a chance... If he can't, then it's all over! Come on, Gohan! You can do it! It's in your hands now... 'Cause if you can't save the day, then who will? Wake up, Kakarot... Destroy all life forms... Wake up, Kakarot... Destroy all life forms... Destroy all life forms... Wake up, Kakarot... Destroy all life forms... Wake up, Kakarot... Destroy all life forms... Wake up, Kakarot... Ow! My head really hurts. Let's take a break for awhile, okay? You don't need a break! Now stop whining and let's get back to work. No, really, I don't think I can move. Fooled ya! Can't you jump any higher than that? Aaaahhh! Piccolo! I'll make that kid stronger than all of us! Mmm! Pineapple! Aaaahhhhh! So... I think I'll finish you off! Aaahhhh! Say good-bye! Nooo! Oh, man... It was just a dream. Don't... hurt my Daddy! Daddy! Gohan! Wake up, Kakarot... Destroy all life forms. Wake up, Kakarot... Destroy all life forms. Wake up, Kakarot... Destroy all life forms. So, there you are. What are you up to? Wake up! Destroy! Wake up! Destroy! Wake up! Destroy! Wake up, Kakarot! Destroy all... Aahh! Haaaa! Huh?! Rrrgh! Gohan! Alright! Split Form! C'mon, Gohan! Let's go back! For your own sake, don't try anything foolish, Gohan! There's nowhere you can go, Gohan! Now stop this foolishness and go back to camp! Oh no! Gohan has changed! Whaaa?! A tail? His tail has grown back! Be sure to make a note of that, would ya? No problem! I just hope he doesn't transform again! Not without the moon... The moon! How did that get back up there?! I don't know! Maybe some one wished it back with the Dragon Balls. I don't think so! Darn that kid! No! He's free! If I don't stop him, he's going to rip this planet apart! I don't know how that moon got back up there! But it's got to go! Impossible! It's not real! It's a projection! Cheers! Ahh! Well, I must say things went pretty smooth. We got all seven Dragon Balls with two months to spare, that's pretty good! Pretty dangerous, if you ask me! Oolong, your such a coward. I'll bet you think taking a shower is dangerous! Well, it is unless you have those gritty little stickers on the bottom of the tub that keep you from slipping, but no, we were in real danger, I hope Goku appreciates what we did for him! Oolong, can't you think of anyone but yourself! Oh my? Sorry! The pressure of all this has gotten to me! How 'bout some coffee? Huh? Oh, no thank you, I'm fine. Nice moon tonight, isn't it? Yes, it's beautiful. A full moon! Hey, is it just me or does something look different about it... Just there's no moonlight! Now! Eat this, ape! Aahh! Yeah! You're definitely a Saiyan, Gohan! I don't think I can beat a Saiyan yet, I need more training! Aaahh! No way! How on Earth am I going to stop him if I can't even get near him? Aaahh! Huh? That's it! The projection! It's coming from that Saiyan space-craft! Wake up, Kakarot! Destroy all life forms! Wake up Kakarot! Destroy all life forms! Goku's ship! What a legacy to leave for his son! Let's see if I can't bring Gohan back down to Earth! Special Beam Cannon. You're turning out to be a lot more trouble than I bargained for... And there's the root of the problem right there! It's this tail of yours! Look at him! Sleeping like a baby. There! That should take care of you for a while 'cause I'm getting too old for this, kid! Sleep well, Gohan... You'll need it. No way! I must be seeing things! It couldn't be! It is! It's the end! I don't believe it! Woo-hoo! Is this some kind of bad joke? There's nothing here! I just can't believe it! Nothing! Oh, wait a second! There! That's it! King Kai must live on that tiny little planet! Woo-hoo! I hope King Kai has lots to eat! I'm starving! Check that out! Nice wheels! Man! I'm getting squashed down here! This is nuts! How could anyone live in a place with this much gravity? Wow! Intense! You've got to be super strong just to stand up here! Ah! I made it, now just one... step at a time! There's a house... That's got to be King Kai's place. Almost there! I can make it! Wait a second! I thought I smelled food! Well, first things first! If that's like King Yemma's fruit, I'm in for a treat! I hope I can make it up there! Wow! Goodness gracious! Hey, there! Are you King Kai? Whoa! I never woulda pegged this guy for the ultimate martial arts master! Uh, excuse me King Kai, my name is Goku. I'd like to train under you, if you'll accept me. Listen, I'm kinda hungry, sir, could I have a piece of that fruit before we start? Wow! That's amazing! This strong gravity doesn't bother you at all, does it? Hoo-boy! Sir Isaac Newton would have never lived to tell about it if one of those apples had hit him! Hey, King Kai! Would you mind throwing one more apple down? I promise I'll catch it this time! Honest! 'Kay! Ready when you are! Aaahhh! Wow! I got it! Sorry, King Kai! I was starving! I am ready though. Please teach me. Oh? I guess I'll follow. Wow! That'll make you strong in this gravity! Hey, this is a lot harder than it looks! Boy-o-boy! I thought I'd seen it all! Uh, hey, who are you? Could Goku have finally stumbled upon the real King Kai? Or has he been made a monkey of again? Will this mysterious character be the one to teach him his new martial arts skills? To find out, don't miss the next exciting episode of Dragon Ball Z!
