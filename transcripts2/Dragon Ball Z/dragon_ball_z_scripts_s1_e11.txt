   [GOKU] I'd better get moving... [NARRATOR] Last time on Dragon Ball Z, Goku was running down Snake Way, hoping to get some special martial arts training from the legendary King Kai... Meanwhile Gohan was busy with his own survival training back on Earth. And the young Saiyan soon learned that it's not easy when you're out in the world all alone. Friends are hard to hold on to, especially when they're the main course on the menu for a hungry T-Rex! Careful Gohan, or you could end up being his dessert! Luckily, Gohan's a natural born fighter, just like his father Goku. But he hasn't developed the fighting skills of his father yet. And with his dino buddy digested by the big T-Rex, Gohan soon found out, only the strong survive! Speaking of strong... Two sinister Saiyans are headed towards Earth right now. Every minute they get closer and that means it won't be long before we all find out what the big bang theory really is... Keep your eyes on the skies and get ready for Dragon Ball Z! [birds chirp] [squawking] [snoring] [DINOSAURS squawk] Hm? Breakfast time! [GOHAN giggles] [giggling continues] Haaaaaa! Ahh... [chuckles] Ahh... [loud thuds] Huh? [growling] What's up? Nice day, huh? You look hungry! [roars] [GOHAN] Whoa! [roars] [roaring continues] Catch me if you can! Nyah! Nyah! Great! It looks like tail steak for breakfast! Hey... You won't have much of a tail if you keep this up. I used to have a tail too, you know! [T-REX groans] So, he's starting to master the training. [chuckles] [NARRATOR] Somewhere, deep in the vastness of space, the two Saiyan warriors continue their journey towards planet Earth. [COMPUTER] Prince Vegeta! We are now within one parsec of the planet Arlia. Initiating vapor bath. It is time to wake up now! [beeping] [YAMCHA] Oh boy! I can't believe Kami is going to train me! I'm so excited I can hardly wait to get started! Just take it easy, Yamcha. You know we have to find out where Tien and Chiaotzu are first! [KRILLIN laughs] I bet they'll be surprised to see us! Heh, heh! And once we find those two, Yamcha can start his training with Kami and then no one will be able to beat him in battle! That's right... I'll be ready for anything! [KRILLIN and PUAR laugh] [PUAR] You said it! That'll be great! [YAMCHA] Hey, step on it, would ya, Bulma?! [VEGETA] Nappa? Nappa? Are you awake? [NAPPA groans] I am now. What's going on? Nothing much. But, I thought we'd make a stop and stretch our legs a bit. Get some exercise. [VEGETA] Planet Arlia's not far from here. Maybe we can sell it for a nice price. That sounds good. [chuckles] I hope these Arlians know how to fight, we haven't had any real competition in a very long time. Wow, whatta mess! [VEGETA] Huh? [NAPPA] There's not much to this place is there? [VEGETA] Obviously not. Let's have a look around shall we? Are you sure you can get a high price for this planet? Doubt it... [VEGETA] Let's check around a little more. [beeping] [ARLIAN 1] You are trespassing on Arlian territory! [ARLIAN 2] Make one move and we'll blast ya! It was a good day to go hunting after all! [ARLIAN 1] Let's give them a proper welcoming. [ARLIAN 1 chuckles] [NAPPA] Let's blast 'em! Easy! [ARLIAN 1] Surrender peacefully or face the consequences! No! [ARLIAN 1] Have it your way then. You've left us no choice! Prepare to be destroyed! Hyaah! [ARLIAN 1] That's the end of them! [gasps] [ARLIAN 2] Surrender at once! Yeah, make me! Grrrh! [VEGETA telepathically] Nappa! Surrender to them! Let's have a little fun while we're here! [NAPPA] Oh, alright... [ARLIAN 1] Move in! They're giving up! [ARLIAN 2] Ha! I guess we were too much for them! [ARLIAN 1] Eh, they sure are ugly! [ARLIAN 2] But they'll be good entertainment for the King. [NAPPA chuckles] [sirens blare] [POLICEMAN A] Stop thief! Stop! [POLICEMAN B] You're under arrest! [LAUNCH] Ugh! Get off my back! Sorry for all the trouble, but this oughta give you some bang for your bucks! [POLICEMEN yell] [screaming] Well, this is for you, Tien! And you better wait for me, 'cause I'm gonna get you lots of food with these greenbacks! [ATTENDANT] More fruit, your highness? [KING] Most entertaining! Come Lemlia, won't you join me? [PRISONERS groan] [ARLIAN GUARD] Get in there, ugly! You'll be glad to know, your cell doesn't have any rats! The prisoners ate 'em all! Ha, ha, ha, ha! Hey remind me to get that guy, okay? [VEGETA chuckles] [PRISONER 1] Look at those aliens! [PRISONER 2] Goodness, they're an ugly pair, aren't they? [PRISONER 3] Maybe they think that we're the ugly ones! Did you ever think of that? [PRISONER 2] Hmph! Speak for yourself! [ATLA] Be quiet, all of you! It doesn't matter what they look like! They're stuck in here just like the rest of us! Can't you see that? They're just more victims of that tyrant king! Locked away and left to rot! I'm afraid you visitors have come at a bad time. The new king of Arlia is very ruthless. He uses us prisoners for his own amusement. He even went so far as to steal my wife, Lemlia, on the day that we were to be married... So you can imagine the pain I feel. [KING] Lemlia please, you have to eat something. [LEMLIA] No thank you. I'm not hungry. [KING] Don't be so stubborn... You have to put the past behind you... You are my Queen now. [LEMLIA] No! There is only one that I truly love. [FIGHTER 2 yells and groans] [KING] Enough! Take Gregor to the pit! Esaw is the new champion! [GREGOR] No, not the pit! Please, Sire, not the pit! No! This isn't fair! [GREGOR screams] No! Please. Don't leave me down here! Give me another chance! [GREGOR screams] No, Yeddy! Please, stay away from me! Stay away! A-Ahhh! [GREGOR screams] [KING sighs] [KING] I'm suffering from royal boredom! [ATTENDANT] Sire, earlier today we captured two aliens. They're in the dungeon now! [KING] Aliens? Have the guards bring them to the arena immediately. Maybe they can provide some entertainment fit for a king! [VEGETA] Don't put yourselves out! We're already here! [KING] What's the meaning of this? Why don't these prisoners have an armed escort in my chamber? [ATTENDANT] I don't know, Sire! No orders were even sent to the dungeon. [VEGETA] Your guards met with an unfortunate accident. [ATLA] Now's my chance to get out of this place. [PRISONERS groan] [ATLA] I must to get to the King's chamber at once! Amazing! Those two aliens melted through the cell bars. That makes things a lot easier for me! [KING] How dare you! Soon it will be your turn to meet with an unfortunate accident. You may not want to watch this, my dear. [LEMLIA] Very well. [KING] I'll see that my guards make short work of these repulsive creatures! Really? [KING] Ah, let's see! Yes, we'll test the big one with the shiny head against our champion in combat! We'll save the little one for last, he won't put up much of a fight I'm sure! Now teach them a lesson! [ESAW] Yes, Sire! [KING] And Esaw? I'll see that you retire a wealthy man if you can defeat both of them. Now begin! [ESAW] Haa! [ESAW yowls] [KING] Huh?! [ESAW screams] [NAPPA] Heh! I guess that makes you the new champion, Vegeta! [VEGETA chuckles] [KING] Not bad! But ten of our finest warriors have mastered techniques using energy just like yours! They have? Interesting! We'd like to fight them! Ready? [KING] I'll see you suffer for your insolence! [NAPPA] Yeah, whatever. Can we get on with this already? [KING] Ah! How dare you! C'mon, your heinousness! Bring on that cricket brigade of yours! We're ready! [KING] Take a good look at my Elite Royal Guards. Now, you won't be talking so tough, will you? [ROYAL GUARD 1] Fire! [chuckles] [gasps] Was that it? It felt good. Real refreshing! [KING] Oh, I'll make you pay! If you think you can just walk out of here, you are sadly mistaken! Guards attack! Destroy them! [ROYAL GUARD 3] We got 'em now! [ROYAL GUARD 6] Attack! [NAPPA laughs] [ROYAL GUARDS yell] [GOKU thinking] Where's King Kai's place? It's got to be around here somewhere! [NAPPA yells] [ROYAL GUARDS whimper] [NAPPA yells] [KING] Release Yeddy! Release Yeddy! Hurry before it's too late! [rumbling] [YEDDY growls gutturally] So, it's the old giant bug in the ground trick! [KING] Yeddy, destroy these creatures! They're bad! Very, very bad! We're bad? Well, a little. [VEGETA] Over here! [NAPPA] Hey, ugly! [NAPPA grunts] [KING] That fool! He's no match for Yeddy's strength! [NAPPA grunts] [YEDDY roars] [KING] No! Hey! I've got one more little surprise for you! [NAPPA grunts] Yaah! It's your going away present! [KING] No! Impossible! Coward! [KING] Please! Don't hurt me! Aaahh! [ATLA] It sounds like there's a battle going on up there! I'm coming for you, Lemlia. What? Unbelievable! The king and his Royal Guard have been destroyed! [VEGETA] Computer. [COMPUTER] Yes, Prince Vegeta? [VEGETA] Send the pods at once. [COMPUTER] Initiating retrieval sequence. [ATLA] Do you two realize what you have done? You have freed our planet from centuries of bondage! At last Arlia is a place where a new beginning can be made! From now on you two visitors from space will be known as heroes among our people. I can't begin to tell you how very grateful I am. [ATLA] Farewell, my friends! You will always be welcome here on Arlia! [ATLA] Thank you! We will never forget you! [LEMLIA] Atla? [ATLA] Huh? [LEMLIA] Atla! Thank goodness! You're alive! [ATLA] Do my eyes deceive me? Is it really you, Lemlia? [LEMLIA] Yes, it's me, Altla, your Lemlia! [ATLA] You don't know how happy I am to see you, my love! [VEGETA]  Let's go, Nappa! We couldn't give away this place if we wanted to. [NAPPA] But that thing back there said we were heroes! Being a hero is highly overrated. Ergh. Too bad, I guess, that was a big waste of time then. [VEGETA] Don't worry there's still Earth to conquer! [LEMLIA] Atla! [VEGETA] Hold on. I've got some unfinished business to take care of... This planet has a serious bug problem. [ATLA]  Lemlia, my darling! [LEMLIA] Atla! [giggles] [LEMLIA] Atla, my love! [ATLA] My darling! At last we can be together forever! [LEMLIA and ATLA giggle] There's nothing like a little fireworks when you say goodbye! [NAPPA] Heh! Their moon, too! Nice touch! [VEGETA] I think we've made the universe a cleaner place today. Arlia deserved what they got. I just hope Earth is a lot better than that planet. It will be... Earth has the Dragon Balls. Once we find them, we can wish for whatever we want! Hm. Immortality, here we come! [evil laughing] [NARRATOR] The dangerous duo is on a mission and they've got Earth in their sights. What the world needs now is a hero, someone to save the day. Someone like Goku, but he's still busy on Snake Way. [GOKU] Doesn't this road ever end?! [NARRATOR] We'll find out... on the next exciting episode of Dragon Ball Z!
