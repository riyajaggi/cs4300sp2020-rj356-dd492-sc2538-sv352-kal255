As the two evil Saiyans hurtled through space on their quest to destroy the Earth, Gohan was giving Piccolo a brief preview of what would happen upon their arrival! Gohan underwent a horrifying change as he unconsciously discovered the Saiyans' secret power... their ability to transform at the full moon. And while Goku sought the Other-Worldly training he needs to defend his home against the Saiyans in one year's time, Piccolo was busy ensuring he would have a home to return to. Powerless to fight the giant ape head on, Piccolo put a stop to Gohan's devastating rampage the only way he knew how! That tail gives them the ability to transform. There! After removing the possibility of another monstrous relapse, Piccolo equipped Gohan with the tools he would need to survive his wilderness training. And with that, the mighty green warrior took his leave to begin some intense training of his own. What new trials await our heroes? Find out today! Wow... How did I get down from that cliff? I can't remember anything... Oh, well. At least I'm down... Time for breakfast! Oh yeah. I should wash my face first... Uh, hey, what's going on? Something... Something's wrong... Aaahhh! My tail is gone! What happened? Where'd it go? What the... These aren't my clothes! Huh? This is weird... Aaaahhhh! Aahh! Ah! Stay back! Aahh! Get away from me! Aaahhh! Stop it! I said leave me alone! Huh?! Aaahh! You don't want me for breakfast! Wouldn't you rather have a bowl of cereal or something? Bad kitty! Bad kitty! Hey! What are you doing? Let go! Put me down! Help! Somebody! Help me please! Help! I need to find some food... What's a guy gotta do to get a burger around here? This sure is a weird place, and those pictures on the wall... They look like... They look just like something I saw in my history book. Aaahh! A-Aaahhh! What is that thing? And what's it doing way out here in the middle of nowhere? Who's there? Who took me out of stand-by mode? Stand-by... Whoa! It's talking! Who are you? What do you want? I'm, uh... My name is Gohan, sir! Well, Gohan. Keep your voice down! What are you trying to do, bury us under tons of sand? My name is Gohan! I heard you. What are you doing out here in this place? That's none of your business! Just put me back in stand-by mode and get out of here! But there's no way out... Except for that trail right behind me. What? Uhh! Ah! All right! Wait... Stand-by mode? Oh yeah... Thanks for everything! Aaahh! I can't even see the bottom! Mr. Robot! Mr. Robot, I can't... Stop yelling! Don't you remember what I told you? I said I can't make it down from way up here. That's not my problem. Uh, but... Now put me back in stand-by mode and get out of here. Thanks and have a nice day! Nope! Don't think so... But I can't get out of here all by myself! I can't! Stop yelling! Now cut that out, or you'll bury us both! Look, I told you how to get out of here. What's your problem? What are you, some kind of cry-baby? Don't you realize that if you don't leave right now, you might be trapped here forever? Now get out of here! Did you leave? Gohan! Come back! You forgot to put me back in stand-by mode! He's gone. Now I'm stuck here forever, wide awake. I can already feel my power cells draining away... Uh, hello? You... You're still here? I get it! You can't see. You're eyes are turned off! Heh, heh, heh. I'll fix 'em! No, wait! Stop that! I don't want your help! Stop... Stop touching that! What do you think you're doing? Don't plug that in! I don't need to see anything down here. You're wasting precious power! That's better. Why you meddlesome little... Hey, you really are little... What's a kid like you doing way out here in my neck of the woods? This place is dangerous! I know and this cave is so high. There's no way I can jump down! Well... You're just going to have to, if you want to stay alive, that is. But you could help me get out of here, right? Couldn't you? Of course, but I'm not going to! You're going to have to learn how to take care of yourself. Now stop bothering me! Now put me back in stand-by mode and leave... I've already wasted too much power dealing with you and your problems. Mmm! You mean this is a buffet? Alright! All-you-can-eat! Aaahhhh! Wake up! Wake up! Please, help me! What-what?! What is it this time? There's a scorpion! Well, this is a cave. Caves have scorpions. But I'm scared... They also have snakes, and bats, and spiders. Now stop being such a baby and put me back into stand-by. I'm so hungry, I could eat a, a, a... Hey, I wonder what cloud tastes like... Me again... Do you have anything to eat? Oh, yes! Being a robot, I always keep plenty of food just lying around. What do you think? Hungry... You could always make yourself a nice snake and scorpion sandwich... Now, for the last time, put me back in stand-by mode and stop bothering me! Keep it down! But I'm starving! Look, if you just stop crying, I'll help you. But you've got to learn to control yourself, alright? At this time of year, the sun shines through a hole in the far right corner of the cave. If you go there and look very carefully, you might find some vegetation. That way. That was great! Look what I found! Right where you said they'd be! Great! Glad to have helped. Well, I guess it's time for stand-by mode again. But... I can't eat these raw. You're never going to survive out here with that kind of attitude. Hey, wait... Aren't you a Capsule Corp. Robot? Yeah, I recognize some of your markings, now. If you're a Capsule Corp. Robot, that means you should have some sort of built-in cooking system. Capsule Corp. Robots are supposed to be the best robots in the whole world! Well, I, uh... I suppose that is true. Hey! Let's see how that cooking system works! Right! How would you like them prepared? Steamed, please. You've got it! Would you like any seasoning? Something spicy or mild? Hmm... Can you make them the same way that my mom does? Uh, well, I, uh... Oh, look. They're done! These sure taste weird... You're welcome. Hey, wait a minute! Well, if you don't like it, then I guess... It's good. I'm sorry! It's just not mom's... I miss her so much and I have no idea where I am or how to get back home. Yes, that must be difficult... And traveling through this endless desert to get back there seems nearly impossible. Yeah... Even if you knew the way, everything else is still against you... The sun, the wind, no food or water... Mr. Robot... Why are you here? An accident... Accident? I was here to excavate these ruins. While I was examining the ancient hieroglyphics, there was an earthquake... The walls of this cave were unstable, and they collapsed all around me... I've been stuck down here ever since. Wait! Now I remember! The pictures on the wall! What are you talking about? They were in my history book! That means that the next time someone comes here to study them, they can rescue us! But, you're the first person I've seen in 30 years. Hey! What are you doing? Answer me! I'm going to get you out of here! Stop that! I don't need your help... I'll leave when I'm ready! Haven't you heard a word I've said? Stop digging! You're almost free, then we can leave here together! I'm storing up my energy... Then I can jump out of here on my own without anyone's help! Wait! You're causing a cave-in! Aaahhhh! Get out of here! I can't hold this thing forever! Huh? But you're... You must leave now! Use the path I showed you! I can't leave you here! I can't! You have to! If you don't, you'll be buried here forever. Get moving! I can take care of myself! Gohan, please! This is your last chance. Climb over me to the pathway and leave this place! Quickly! Alright... Now jump! Jump out as far as you can! What are you waiting for? Do it! Now! Right! I... can't do it! Have you lost your mind? Gohan... I stopped this pillar from crushing us... But now you are cut off from the only way out... Now listen to me very carefully... Reach inside my head and connect the blue wire to the red one. They are right up front. Connect the... -Quickly! -Right! This will route all of my reserve energy into my power cells... Hurry! This place is coming down fast! Got it! Full Power! Ready, Gohan? Ready for what? Mr. Robot! Mr. Robot? Aahh! Mr. Robot! It's my fault. All my fault... I'm so sorry... Gohan? I'm here! I thought you'd left me. Not just yet, but soon... Throwing that pillar drained all of the energy in my power cells. Even my reserves... Come now, Gohan... That won't do any good. Don't go... Remember what I told you, Gohan. You have to learn to take care of yourself. Be strong... Please! No more stand-by mode. It's time to shut down... Time to shut down. Uh?! Mr. Robot? Wake up! Come on! Wake up! Please don't leave me! Let me help you, the same way you helped me! You can't go! Please! Mr. Robot! I don't know if I can make it on my own out here... But I'll try... I will try... What awaits young Gohan as he continues his life-changing training? And what will Goku find down this long and winding path in the clouds? With every moment they spend finding out, the Saiyans move a moment closer to Earth. The story continues next time, on Dragon Ball Z!
