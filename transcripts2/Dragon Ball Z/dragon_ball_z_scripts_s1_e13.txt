   Last time on Dragon Ball Z, Gohan kept on training by putting a tail-less T-Rex through its paces... And Piccolo pulled off an amazing feat... Focusing his powers, he caused the pyramids to levitate... Not to be outdone, Tien pulled off his own amazing stunt by pushing a wall of water back up the face of a cliff... And what about Goku? He found some time to take a nap while hitching a ride with a street cleaner on Snake Way... Too bad he didn't hold on tight when he hit that bump in the road. Hey? Where am I? I remember hitching a ride on that truck, but how did I end up in a place like this? Smells good! Never one to pass up a meal, Goku found himself drawn to a very delicious fruit tree... That looks tasty! Too bad that juicy piece of fruit is private property! Oh, and wait till you find out who it belongs too! What is this strange place? It certainly isn't Earth and it's nowhere near Snake Way... Looks like Goku has really gotten off the beaten track this time. And he's taken quite a beating for it too! Well, that's what you get for trying to steal King Yemma's fruit! Uh, you mean I'm not allowed to eat any of that? You got that right, buddy... That tree there? It belongs to the great King Yemma... And only he can eat the fruit! Aw! C'mon! Just one piece! Don't listen to him, Goz! So you want to eat King Yemma's fruit? Just who do you think you are? Heh. Yeah, what makes you so special? I'm Goku! I ran here so I could receive some martial arts training! Which one of you is King Kai? Hmmm... It's not me! You mean neither of you guys is the great King Kai? You poor little chump! Don't you have any idea where you are? This is the land below the clouds! The land of no return! It's also where we live. Once somebody comes here there's no going back! What?! You're kidding... That means I must have fallen of Snake Way some how! Then you've automatically got a free lifetime membership down here! Haha! Yeah! A free membership! Oh that's great! How am I supposed to climb Korin Tower by myself? Sheez. Hey Tien! Don't even think about leaving me down here! All right, Goku... I'll show you that I can do what ever you can... Just you wait, I'll show you how strong I am! Tien... How long till we see Kami? I'm really, really excited! Be patient... We'll see Kami soon enough, my friend. But you have to promise me you'll be on your best behavior from this point on! Which means... No more questions, okay? Hm... All right... No, that won't work! Hey! What about this? There's gotta be something in this place I can use to climb with... This? No, that? Eh, forget it! Darn! What a bunch of useless junk! Bah! There's nothing in this place at all! What are you doing in my teepee? Isn't it obvious? I need to find a ladder or something so I can climb up Korin Tower! I don't have anything like that... Now get out of there right now! I've got lots of money! I don't need your money! Sorry, pal, then I'll take what I want! What's going on father? Upa! It's okay, son. Stay back! What do you think you're doing, lady? I'm no lady! Aahh! A-A-A-A-A-Chooo! Whoopsie... I gotta get back on to Snake Way. Wow! He sure can jump! Yeah, right! Hey Goz, I bet we could have a lot of fun with that guy, don't ya think? Yeah, he sure seems to have an awful lot of energy, doesn't he? I could get some real good exercise messin' with him for a while! Hey what do you mean, Goz?! Why do I do all the paperwork and you have all the fun? Let's fight it out then! The loser stays in the office! Are you ready? Let's go! One, two, three! Scissors cuts paper! Heh, heh, heh. Try not to get a paper-cut, Mez! Hey, try and be a good sport and save some for me! Sure, I'll try... Not! Lucky ogre! That's a long way up. Hey, buddy! Would you like a little help? Hm? Well, why not? Sure... But, so far I haven't even come close yet. Just leave it to the Goz-man! I've got a knack for these things. Hey! Let go! What are you doing? Oh, Goz's done it again! Man! That big lug just can't resist finishing them off right away every time! Darn! I never get to have any fun! Wh-Wh-Whoa! Wow! That little guy must be pretty strong! I still couldn't reach it... I guess you're not strong enough. Oh, yeah, we'll see who's strong! I challenge you to a wrestling match! Uh, sure, but I just hope King Kai's stronger than you, because I want him to train me! It's really important! Okay, I'm gonna knock your block off! Hey take it easy, would ya? All right! If you win the match I'll lend you my special flying machine! Okay? You can use it to reach Snake Way! Really? But if you lose you're here for keeps... And you'll become my personal play-toy! You understand that? Sure... It's a deal! Okay. Meet by the blood fountain in a half hour... And the rules are, there are no rules! Great! Sounds fair to me! Okay, the first one over this line, loses! You got it? Sounds alright to me. Let's go. Not so fast! I have to warm up! Visualizing! Now I've got you by the head! Okay! Now I'm ready! Come on! On your mark... Get set and go! Whoa! Hey. Is it my turn... Goz? Sure kid. Okay! Hey! No fair. How did you do that? Easy! Watch this! ♪ Row, row, row your boat... ♪ This is the special flying machine? Oh, yeah, it's very special. See, I made it myself. I am gonna have to stand up there though in order for it to work. It's very technical. Well, let's see it in action... Sure let me press the start button! Here I come! Whew! Wow! This might do it! That's it! Kaa! Mee! Haa! Mee! Hahh! Yippee! Hah, ha, ha! Hey, I can't get through... Oh, bummer! ♪ Merrily, merrily... ♪ Okay gather around for another soul call... Number 3465! Yo! Number 3466! Here! Number 3467! Hello? Here! Number 3468! Present! Number 3469! That's me! Number 3470! Number 3470! Um, here! Good, then... Everyone's here! Today we're gonna be doing some hiking! All the way up Mt. Needle. Please pick a buddy and stay with them! Alright, move along... You too, get going. Hm? That guy's still trying to get out of here? Well, I guess I'll get my chance with him after all. Ow! Man! That smarts! Goz! What do you think you're doing? You know that it's my turn after lunch! Jerk! Hey, Goz! I thought you said that there was a way to get through those clouds up there? There is. You'd be through right now if it wasn't for your problem. My problem? What do you mean, my problem? Your head's too soft. Hey! You tricked me! Yo yo, listen buddy! You want to get back up to Snake Way, don't you? Well, I'm just the ogre you're looking for! Really? You know a way up there? I sure do, there's a secret passageway! Mez! What do you think you're doing? Hey! Can you show me this passageway? Sure, but on one condition. Huh? What's that? It's simple! We're going to play a little game, and you're it. I'm going to start running and if you manage to catch me, then I'll show you where the secret passageway is. You want to play along? Sure. That's it? All right. That's it? "That's it," he says! I happen to be the fastest ogre in the land! You guys really need to get out of the house more often. Come on! Faster! Ah... This should be enough food for awhile... I guess... Come on! This way! U-Uhh... Come on! Follow me! Hurry up! You're too slow, Mr. Tiger! All right! Are you ready? Yeah, I'm ready. Are you? Tough guy, huh? Well good for you, kid! I'm glad you're feeling confident because if you don't catch me, you're stuck here for good! Yeah, I know! Now let's do this! Runners, on your mark... set... and... go! See ya, loser! Man! Cookin'! Here I come! Little does he know that nobody's ever caught Mez except the Great King Yemma... But then again... it has been a pretty odd day. So? Can you feel your legs burning yet? No! They're fine! Good! 'Cause I'm finished with this little warm-up! Aahh! Haaaa! Bummer! Missed him! That was a good chance! Wha... Now that's fast! Man! Ah! I'm pretty sure I lost him. It should be safe to take a breather! Yikes! Busted! Gotcha! Nice shot! Try again! I saw that! This is great! I haven't had this much fun in centuries! We can play this everyday for eternity! Sorry, I've got better things to do! Heh, heh! You might have better things to do, but remember if you don't catch me you're not going anywhere! Yeah! We'll see about that! Now! Uhoh. I think he's gaining on Mez. Hey, hold on! Wait a minute! Time out! There are no time outs! That's fine, but whatd'ya say we each have a piece of that fruit for a snack? Absolutely not! King Yemma has us guard that fruit for him because it's so special, just one piece will double a man's strength and keep him full for three months. You mean if you ate one piece you really wouldn't get hungry for three months? Exactly! Y'see... Hey, where'd you go? No! Stop! I could lose my job! Don't even kid around about this! Goodness gracious! This has never happened to us before! Gotcha! Nitwit! So, where is it? The secret passage? Uh, what secret passage? What are you talking about? You better be careful! If you lie, King Yemma will be very unhappy! Ah, it's right over there! Okay, this is it! It's right through here! Just take the stairs up. You can get back to Snake Way from here. See ya later! I certainly hope not. Oh, and thank you very much for the fruit! Yeah, all that exercise made me really hungry. Bye! You little sneak! Goz, did you see that? Darn! Yeah, I saw it... We got totally burned! Yeah, for the first time! That's not bad! Hey! We're still the baddest ogres in the land! No one can beat us! Whatta ya say we keep this little incident between the two of us? Duh! Man! What a wild stairway! I feel like I'm in a dream! Huh? Wow, that must be the road up there! He should be there by now! Man! This is heavy! All right! Made it! Hmm... Goku, what are you doing in my desk? Yiiyye! Uhhh... Hi, Great King Yemma! I thought you were on Snake Way. Uh, I am! I mean I was! I mean, I'm should get going! Bye, bye! Goodness. How strange. Oh, man, It looks like those crafty ogres had the last laugh after all! Now I'm really going to have to motor it if I want to make it back from King Kai's in time to save Earth! Wow! I feel as light as air! I guess it's from that fruit I ate! So Goku is back at the start of Snake Way and that means he's still a long way from training with King Kai. Luckily that piece of fruit will give him the strength to keep going for awhile, but will it last long enough? There's still that little problem of the two Saiyans rapidly approaching Earth... Time is running out. Can Goku pick up the pace and get to the end of Snake Way in time? To find out make sure you don't miss the next exciting episode of Dragon Ball Z!
