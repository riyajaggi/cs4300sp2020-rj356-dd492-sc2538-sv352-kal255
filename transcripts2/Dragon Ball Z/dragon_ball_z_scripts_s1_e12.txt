   OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn Last time on Dragon Ball Z, the two terrifying Saiyan warriors continued their journey through space. Every passing minute they get closer and closer to planet Earth! Meanwhile, Goku is still in the other world jogging along Snake Way, in search of the legendary King Kai. His goal, to get some special martial arts training from the King, if he can find him. But what about poor Gohan? Has he been left all alone on Earth to become a bite-sized snack for a hungry T-Rex? I don't think so! The pint-sized powerhouse is busy training and he's already learned his first lesson in survival. It's not how big you are that matters, it's how big you slice your T-Rex tail steak! Though Gohan can hold his own, he remains under the watchful eye of Piccolo. So, he's starting to master the training. After a hard day's training, Gohan has decided to turn in for some much deserved rest. On this cool night, underneath the starry sky, the whole world seems to be at peace. But, Gohan has more than pleasant dreams on his mind. Daddy... Daddy... Let's go... Daddy... Aaahhh! Run! Gohan! Go now! Get out of here! Daddy... No... Hello mister sun! Thanks for the beautiful day! My hands are dry! Now it's time to get something to eat! I gotta be getting close to King Kai's place by now! Gotta find King Kai... Gotta find King Kai... Gotta find King Kai... Gotta find King Kai... Gotta find King Kai... Gotta find King Kai... It seems as if Goku's been gone a long time, I wonder if he's met up with King Kai and begun training? Remember what Baba told us, don't let Goku come back to life for a year, even if we collect all the Dragon Balls. Yes. But a whole year? That's not very good for us because by that time, the Saiyans will already be on Earth! Yeah, but do you think there's any chance that we could protect the Earth from the Saiyans on our own? Oh, well it's been nice knowing ya. Are we almost there, Bulma? Relax, would ya?! We're going to get there! I promise it won't be too much longer! I hope not 'cause we gotta find Tien and Chiaotzu and climb Korin Tower! Look, I just want to be ready when those Saiyans arrive! You're right. The fate of the Earth is at stake. Aaahhhh! Hey! Come on, it's lunch time! You better come get it while it's hot! I don't deliver! Let's go you two! Get in gear! Ooohh! Whoa, Tien... look! You made all this yourself? What are you crazy? I hired a bunch of cooks to do all the work! These guys are the best in the business and they only use the freshest ingredients... Right?! All this food must have cost a lot. Don't worry about it. I just happened to have come into a lot of dough lately... Here you go, Tien. How long are you going to keep training for anyway? He won't stop training until he knows he can beat Goku. Yeah right... Like that's gonna happen! These are peaceful times. There's no need to pump yourself up so much if you don't really have to fight. Besides you're strong enough, Tien. I'm not strong enough. I know if I train hard I will beat Goku someday... But this world is small and full of many people. Each one might try to challenge me. And that is why I must train. Hmph. Good for you, Tien. But why don't you put your strength to good use and come to work with me? You'd get rich. Just think, with your brawn and my brains, we could pull off some major bank heists. It would be so easy, in no time we'd be living like royalty for sure. 'Cause money does buy happiness! You with me? Tien, let's eat. I'm starving! Now that's a good boy. You go ahead and start eating. You gotta keep your strength up! Thank you! Look, Tien, robbing banks is the way to go! It's so exciting when you take control. You fire one shot in the air and everybody scatters like mice! So, come on... Whatta ya say you and I give it a shot? We could be great! Chiaotzu, let's go! How come? Doesn't he know it's an offer he can't refuse? Thanks for the food. It was delicious! Oh no! You can't leave without your dessert! Aaahh! Why don't you take a bite of this, baldy? Goku, I hope your training is going well... You're going to need it. Hi! What are you doing all the way out here? What does it look like I'm doing? I'm sweeping Snake Way! King Yemma asked me to do it 'cause he likes to keep it nice and clean! Hm? No kidding? I'm on my way to King Kai's place! What? You're running all the way to King Kai's place? Well for your feet's sake I hope you brought an extra pair of shoes with you. Why is it a long way away from here? Now, that all depends on what you consider a long way, but from here I would say that you're about a quarter of the way there! What?! No way! I'm only a quarter of the way there? Boy it is really far away. Hey! Do you think you're gonna make it? Sure, I've just got to rest a bit! Right. Hey! If you want me to, I can give you a ride half of the way there. Come on, hop on the back! Really? All right! Hahaha! Great! Thanks! Let's go! Okay! Hang on! Haaaaa! Wow. Chiaotzu! It worked, Tien! No, it didn't. It's still not good enough, my friend. That's not good! If I don't get in control of my powers soon, it could be disastrous... I can't afford to make anymore mistakes like I did back there. C'mon! Faster! Hey, that's strange. I wonder what's going on over there. It's an earthquake! Oh, no! A-Aaaaahhh! An earthquake? This is just great! I'm really not in the mood for this right now! Help! Tien! Tien! Oh no! Come on! Let's go! Look out, Tien! Target located. I know where Tien is now! Where on Earth is that kid? Yeah! Made it! Alright! Ha, ha, ha! Whoa! That was close! I'm freezing... A-A-A-A-Achoo! U-Uhh... What happened? Oh no! I must have sneezed again! Tien is somewhere in these mountain ranges... Heh. That figures. It's just the kind of place he'd want to do his training. Tien, I'm sorry for all the trouble I've caused you. I think it's time for me to go back to the Turtle House now. That's a good idea. Give my regards to Master Roshi. Tell him I'm still training and I'll come visit as soon as I'm finished. Okay, I will! See you two later! Goodbye now... Take care... Now I can finally concentrate on my training. You said it! Oh! It's so beautiful. Ah... Lovely! A-Achoo! There you are! You know I've been looking for you! You won't get away from me! Now I want you two to quit goofing around and get over here right now! Hey get lost! Launch is shooting at us! What? No, that can't be... Goku's dead? Yeah, he's training with King Kai in the other world. We don't know how long he'll be gone, so we'll have to prepare for the Saiyan's arrival on our own. That's right. And Kami is going to help us get ready! Kami! I'll help if you need me! Let's get going! But Tien, we can't leave here... You know... Quiet little man! Oh, Tien... Don't even think about trying to forget me! I'm going to follow you wherever you go and I don't care if you go all the way to Kami's place! All right... I'll train as hard as I can with Kami... We'll defeat the Saiyans and I'll defeat Goku as well! Hi ya, King Kai. My name's Goku. It's a real honor to meet ya. Sorry, I'm late! Um... Aahh! Ouch! Boy, when you start training you don't mess around, do you King Kai? Hey? Where am I? I remember hitching a ride on that truck but how did I end up in a place like this? Smells good! Well... As long as I'm here, I might as well get something to eat! I've still got a long journey ahead of me. Those look tasty! Goku goes off the beaten path and gets beaten... But by who? And, there are more urgent matters at hand. The Saiyans are still on course for Earth, and if Goku doesn't get some training from King Kai soon, the planet won't have a chance of surviving!
