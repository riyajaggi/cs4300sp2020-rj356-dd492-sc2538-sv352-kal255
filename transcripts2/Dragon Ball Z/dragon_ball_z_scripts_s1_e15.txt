   Last time on Dragon Ball Z, Goku took a snooze and was haunted by nightmares of the two terrifying Saiyans who are making their way towards planet Earth... That got him back on his feet and moving even faster along Snake Way... He came across a castle that he thought was King Kai's, but it turned out that it belonged to the charming but deadly Princess Snake... And oh boy, did she ever live up to that name! Once the Princess shed her skin, Goku realized he was in the belly of a beast. So he made a hasty retreat... But it turns out that the Princess never lets her guests leave her with an empty stomach, and Goku almost became the hot item on the menu! Not wanting to end up snake food, Goku shook the Princess off his tail by setting a trap of his own... Using himself as bait, he tied the Princess up and left her tightly tangled and got back on Snake Way... Now he's on track again, still in search of King Kai and the special martial arts training that he so badly needs... Meanwhile, Gohan is doing his own training on Earth... It won't be long until those two evil Saiyans arrive on the planet. I sure hope Goku and Gohan have what it takes to stop them! Every good martial artist knows that you have to train your mind as well as your body, and Gohan is no exception... With his daily training completed, he keeps his mind busy with his school homework... But all the arithmetic and language lessons in the world can't keep memories of his mother and father from creeping into his head... Let's see... Carry the one and add two... No... X equals one and carry the one... Hm... What a smart boy you are, Gohan! You just solved one of the hardest problems in your book! Thatta boy! You keep studying like that and you're going to be a great scholar one day. I just know it! Yup! He's a chip off the old block! I miss my Mommy and Daddy so much... On the other side of the planet, Piccolo works on his own kind of intensive training... Recalling his near-disastrous battle with Raditz, he works out new fighting strategies and attack combinations... Here it comes! Special Beam Cannon! Hraaah! He... He dodged it... He's faster than the... the speed of light! You took a chunk out of my armor. I guess even you can get lucky sometimes... I won't let it happen again. Ha. You won't even see the next attack coming! You don't even come close to my power level. Give it up! You're through! Your life will end today! I don't think so! Ah! Great! It works! Yeah! Yahoo! That... snake... lady sure wasted a lot of my time! I've really got to pick up the pace if Earth is going to be saved! Woo-hoo! What a ride! If only my daddy could see me now! Nah-nah! You won't catch me! Bleh! Hi! How are you? U-Uh... Whoa! Where am I? This sure is a big place... I wonder if I can find my house from here... I hope so... Mommy! Here I come! Hraaah! ChiChi? Are you in there? Open up! I've brought some porridge for you. It'll make you feel better! Come on! I'm not hungry... ChiChi... You haven't eaten anything in the last week. Have some food. Come on... Open up now! Leave me alone... The poor girl really misses. Gohan and Goku... Yahoo! Hey... This looks familiar! I came back to the same place I was before! Oh, no... This way, Mr. Tiger! An... island? I'm on an island? I must be a long, long way from home... That means I'll have to figure out a way to get off of this island... somehow. I can do it... I have to! Mm hmm... Well, I guess that might work, maybe. My greatest opponent is myself... If I can discover what my weaknesses are, then I will be an even stronger fighter than I already am... Special Beam Cannon! This should do the trick. Guess I'll have to chop it down! Hyaaa! Hi-yaaa! Thank you! Whew! That was hard work! Now it's time for a snack. Finished! I did it! I did it! Okay! I'm going home! Don't worry, Mr. Tiger, I'll come back! I just need to go home and see my Mom first, okay? And stroke... and stroke... and stroke... and stroke... And stroke... stroke... stroke... stroke... Good... There's some wind! Whoa! Whoa-ho-ho! Yahoo! It's the kid! Gohan? Oh, no! A storm is coming! I've gone too far to go back now, and just in case, I better eat this food while I still can! Uh-oh! I'm taking on water! Oh, no! Maybe this wasn't such a good idea after all. Boy, I wish I could swim! Where is he? I sense he's around here somewhere! Help me, Daddy! All alone on a stormy sea! How will Gohan get out of this one? Hopefully Piccolo will find him in time. If he doesn't, you can say bon voyage to the pint-sized Saiyan... Hang on Gohan, hang on! And don't you miss the next exciting episode of Dragon Ball Z!
