   Last time, on Dragon Ball Z! Evil rained down upon an unsuspecting Earth! And the quiet of a peaceful morning in the city was shattered, as two Saiyan space pods came crashing to the planet's surface! After a year-long journey through space, the dreaded Saiyan warriors have finally arrived! And the Earth's greatest defenders are ready to meet them... Goku's friends have already used the power of the Dragon Balls to restore the fallen hero back to life. And with his super-charged strength and speed, he has launched into the two-day trip down Snake Way! Every second counts. Over a day still remains in Goku's journey. But the Saiyans attack... Today! Alien! Oh, my... Incredible... He's getting out! So what should we do with these gawking fools! They bother me! Wh-Who are they? What are they?! Oh, I don't know. Why don't you decide for once? Heh! Really? Thanks, Vegeta. This is going to be a lot of fun for me. Don't mention it. Try to hold on! What are they... What are they doing?! This is intense! Do you think I was trying too hard to impress them, Vegeta? There isn't anyone left to impress, Nappa. I should have known better than to let you have any fun. But why? Hey, c'mon! A little destruction won't effect the sale price of this planet. What's the big deal? Try to use your brain... We came here for the Dragon Balls, remember, for the wish. You remember the wish, don't you, Nappa? Well, yeah, we were going to wish for immortality, weren't we? Good, and we need all seven balls, right? So let me ask you... What if one of the balls happened to be in the city you just destroyed? I'm sorry. I guess I just forgot about that, huh? Well, let's both forget about it. What's done cannot be undone. Now, first we need to find out who has the highest power level. He'll be the one who finished off Raditz. Huh? More than half-a-dozen people on this planet have power levels over a thousand! How is that possible? How should I know? Maybe they've been preparing for us... Not to worry. Let's start out by finding the strongest one. I just found two of them. They definitely have the highest fighting power on the planet. Really? Good then. This may be interesting after all. To repeat... An unknown force of devastating power has completely destroyed all of East City. Government officials have ruled out the possibility of foreign acts of war. There were no earthquakes in the area, but noted physicists have said that the bright white light that surrounded the city could have been caused by a multi-dimensional shift. Well, the day has finally arrived. C'mon, let's go help the others. I can tell you where they are! What? Are you crazy? What are we going to do? Oolong! You're such a coward! Yeah! We're going to help! You just tell us what to do, Master Roshi, and we'll do it! Sorry, gang. Oolong's right. - Huh? - What?! I'm afraid it's true. This sort of battle is just way out of our league. We'd only get in the way of the others' if we were there with them. Yeah, I guess so. Oh my goodness! Yamcha! Goku! Where are you? Hold on everybody! I'm coming as fast as I can! I know you can do it! Hold on! Heh! Amazing! This planet's weak gravity makes me feel like a kid again. I'm invincible! It's time! Man are they movin'! All right! Well, at that speed it won't take them very long to get to Piccolo and Gohan! Goku, you better hurry up and get back! You know how much I hate fighting without you. Gohan! Get ready, they're headed straight for us! Right! Chiaotzu! Look, why don't you just stay here? No way! I'm coming! I didn't train so hard for nothing! Besides, I'm sticking with you! I can't believe it! There's nothing left! All right! Let's move it! Say something, Ed! It's reading a little hot. It's safe though. As you can see, East City is gone. Only a crater remains where the great city once stood. How and why the city vanished earlier today remains a mystery... Inspector. Any guesses yet, Sir? I'm afraid not. At this point, we're completely baffled. Yeah, well I know what happened! Who's that? Oh, man! I was right! The Saiyans are here! And I'm supposed to help fight 'em. Maybe I can just go back to bed and pretend I didn't see this. Hey, you over there! You had something to do with all of this, didn't you? Oh, yeah right! Like I can destroy cities. Inspector Bonehead. If I could do that, I wouldn't be shaking right now, would I? You freeze, Mister! You're going to tell me what you know! Hey! Easy, Inspector! Well! For the last time! It wasn't me, you dope! It was the Saiyans! The Saiyans? And just who are they? What do you think! They're aliens! Really scary ones! And they're gonna blow up the world! But, me and my team... We're gonna try and stop 'em. See, we're like a secret task force that protects the Earth. Now do you get it? Thank goodness! He's gonna save us from the little green men. Ha! Really, we're lucky! Right? Listen, that's great if you want to save the world, but could you do it somewhere else? This is a restricted area! What a scoop, huh? You can have it! Heh, heh! No thanks! You think you're so smart! Right! You're fools! I can prove my story's true! Heh! You want proof? Just take a look right there. What are we looking at? You going to do a trick for us now? You moron! Look behind me! How dare you! Look! These things right here! They're space ships, okay? Space ships?! H-How do you know? Just come look. Men! Search over here! Yes, Sir! Check out those round things! Right! Hey, listen pal! Can we talk for a moment here, privately? I'd like to run your story, if you'll tell it. Sure, but we super-heroes have to eat you know. Oh... Well, how about I take you to lunch? Excuse me, Inspector! I don't know what this stuff is, but I've never seen anything like it before, sir! Huh? You're kidding! Five thousand! For an exclusive! How's that for lunch? Now, can you tell me why these space men came down to Earth? Hey, buddy, not so fast! We want to hear the story too. We've got money and plenty of it! So do we! We'll give you whatever you want. Us, too! Let's hear it! Easy, there, Inspector, first things first! My stomach's growling! Money I don't really need, but hot dogs... Here, it's not much! But with that badge you get free doughnuts! I've got it! They went that way! I mean that way! Let's see... They're definitely there. About three thousand miles in that direction. See you there. You bet! Heh, heh. Hey! If you're smart you'd take my advice. Don't go anywhere near those Saiyans. Those two will be a living nightmare. I say last one there is a rotten egg! Eat my dust! Let's go, men! We've got to go find those aliens! Hm! Losers! Oh, well, Ha... I've got better things to do now, like chow-down! Though, maybe I should blow off dinner and go help them fight the Saiyans... Na! They're on their way here! Gohan, do not be afraid! Your preparation has been excellent! Have faith in yourself. I'm ready. What is this? There's someone else coming! It looks like there might be one more than we expected! But I thought you said there were only supposed to be two Saiyans! H-Huh? It's Krillin! Right! How 'bout some help? Heh, heh. Yeah, sure, why not! But things are going to get intense! You might just slow us down, Krillin! I doubt that! I've been doing a little training of my own! So you have. I can feel a significant increase in your power level. Man! Goku's running late. We'll have to hold out without him, somehow. He's coming? I mean you really know that for sure, Krillin? Huh? Of course he is! Master Roshi just talked to him the other day! Don't worry, Gohan. He'll be here, alright. Wow! That's great. Thanks Krillin. Hey, you grew up with my Dad, didn't you? He said guys thought you couldn't fight because you were so short. Short, huh? Actually, we were the same size. But then he kept growing and I stopped. By the way. Are you all right? No one's ever trained with Piccolo before. Aw! It wasn't that bad! Once you get used to him, he's great! Hey! That's enough of your small talk! They're here! So, one more joined them! What do you suppose these three are doing out in the middle of nowhere? I think they were waiting for us. Yes, I'm sure of it. Whoa... This is it. It's really happening. So these are the Saiyans. Can you feel those power levels? They're even stronger than I imagined! What're we gonna do, guys? So, we meet at last! The pleasure's mine. I'm only going to say this once. Leave this planet. This is your first and last chance to get out of this alive. That voice! I see. You're the one who defeated Raditz one year ago. My voice? Right. Didn't Raditz tell you? Our scouters also work as communicators. The green one's from Namek, isn't he? Yes. He's from Namek all right. No wonder Raditz had such a hard time with him and Kakarot. I'm from Namek! Eh? Piccolo! I didn't know you were from outer space! Of course... It makes sense. Is-Is that true, Piccolo? You didn't know? Well, what a surprise. Surely you must have suspected something before now! The green skin and pointy ears are a dead give away, don't you think? So, I'm from the planet Namek! I can't believe it, but at the same time, I know it's true! Yes! It's true! It was you who told Raditz about the Dragon Balls! Now tell us! Where are they? But, no one knows where they are! Not for a whole year! That's enough. We know the balls are down here! Make no mistake! We will find them with you alive or with you dead! It's your decision! Tell us where they are or you will all be killed! Heh! I want to thank you... Because of you, I now know that I come from the planet Namek. But, this is my planet now! And no one is going to tell me what to do with it! So, back off! We're not here to bow down to your demands! We're here to fight! So go ahead and do whatever it is you came here to do! Are you okay? Yes... I'm fine, Mr. Popo. For the first time in my life I have heard about my origin. Now I know the reason why I have always had special powers. You see, they just said I'm from space... A place called Namek. It all makes sense. When I created the Dragon Balls I fulfilled a deep yearning. The blueprints for the balls existed in my mind and heart long before I was able to give them form. When I finally succeeded, I felt as if I had made it home. Or rather, as if a piece of home, had found its way to me. Let's get out of here! I guess they're not going to tell us where the Dragon Balls are, Nappa. You wanna bet? Alright! Let's see how strong you really are! The kid's at a thousand. The Namek is at fourteen hundred, and the midget's at eleven hundred. You fools! Do you really think you can beat us with such puny power levels? Hey, Nappa... Take your Scouter off. What? It seems they know how to concentrate energy and raise their fighting powers. These figures are most unreliable. Hey, right, good call! Now I remember. That pathetic loser, Raditz, let himself be fooled by all of their power readings. You two be ready for them! Wait, Piccolo, if they're stronger than Raditz, and Goku isn't here, how can you expect to defeat them with just us? Oh, well, guys... Let's just do it. Nappa, I believe it's time we have a little fun with them. Better yet, get those Saibamen out. There should be six of them left... They'll do. You're too much! You really know how to have fun! Huh? Saibamen? I don't see any men. You're right, there are six. Maybe the Saibamen can persuade them to tell us where the Dragon Balls are, huh, Nappa? Oh, I think they can arrange that. Uh, okay, what are they doing? I think we're about to find out. There. Well, at least... they're shorter than I am! They're brainless, crazy monsters! They're strong, too. This should be a pretty good match up. These Saibamen seem spunky. I'll take the two on the left! I've got the two in the middle. The two on the right are yours, Gohan! Okay! Will these sprouted Saiyan spawn prove to be more than our heroes can handle? Or will they somehow be able to withstand the onslaught long enough for Goku to return? With the fate of the entire world in the balance, Goku's help can't come fast enough... On the next episode of Dragon Ball Z!
