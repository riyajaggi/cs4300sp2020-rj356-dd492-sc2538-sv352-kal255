   Last time on Dragon Ball Z... With the deadly Saiyan duo on the horizon, Earth's heroes had no choice but to put their training plans into overdrive... Goku continued his search for King Kai along Snake Way while Tien and the others made their way up Korin's Tower for a little one-on-one with the mythical master... All the time Gohan had spent alone got the better of him, and he was so homesick that he felt the need for a family reunion... But it was not to be. Common sense took over and he realized that he must complete his training and put the brakes on the incoming Saiyan invasion first. Without his mom or dad to support him, all the non-stop training has been tough on the little guy... Luckily, Piccolo showed up and took him under his wing. Now, Gohan will learn what it takes to be a real warrior... But will it be enough to stop the Saiyans? Hm. Now, are you ready, Gohan? Do you think you have what it takes to move on to the next level of training? Good! With an attitude like that, you just might make it. Go! Give me everything you've got! Haah! Try again! Keep your eye on the enemy! But you disappeared, I couldn't see you. If you can't see the enemy, feel him out! That's a lot easier said than done. Next time you find time to whine, think about what you should do instead... and do it! We only have three months until the Saiyans arrive, Gohan. From now on, if you're not eating or sleeping then you're sparring with me! Got it? That's a little severe, huh? The Saiyans are severe! But as strong as they are, you're going to have to be a lot stronger! There's no room for doubt in this venture! That's it! Your turn! This is crazy! There's just no end to this thing! But I've got to keep going! Raah! Kami will see all of you now. Hey, Kami! I don't mean to be rude, but we're not really learning anything new! He's right... So far you haven't taught us anything we couldn't do on our own. We want to be as strong as Goku was when he was here! Yeah! Come on! We want the same training you gave Goku, Kami! Please listen carefully, then. I taught... Goku... Nothing! That's what I taught him! Waah! Hey! What did he mean by that?! Who knows? If this camp wasn't free, I'd be out of here! Just between you and me, the food's not that great. Mr. Popo, we all know Goku received training here before! Why can't you tell us what it was? C'mon! We're just trying to get stronger, that's all! To be truly strong, you must know your self and your enemy... Once you know this, all will become clear. What do you mean? Know myself? Don't give us that rubbish! How could we not know ourselves! I know myself better than anybody. Oh, is that a fact? So you know yourself, do you? How come you don't know that you are weak? Oh! Would you like to prove that? You beachball! All of you follow me. Wow! Whoa, check it out! What is this place? Here, past, present, and future are mixed. Amazing! This is where you'll start your time trip... When Goku was with us, most of his training took place in this room. Yeah? Goku? That's right. I hope you're ready. I think we are! Let's do it! Yeah! Hey guys, have fun! I'm a lot of different things, but I ain't no guinea pig. Those of you who wish to go, step inside the circle, please. Gentlemen, I can only recommend that you see with your hearts... Now, close your eyes, please. The next time you open your eyes, you will be in a far off place exactly one hundred years ago. I wish you luck, gentlemen. Where are we? I don't know, but there's been some serious fighting going on around here! This place is demolished! Sounds like all of the fun is over, though. Listen. Look! It's a Saiyan! Not anymore! Listen! I think I hear something! There! That could've been anything. Yeah, but it was definitely something! C'mon, let's go check this place out! Man, what a battle this must have been. Look at all these Saiyans. Too bad we missed all the action. Mr. Popo must have been off on his calculations. It's over. There's bound to be a few Saiyans left, we'll just look around until we find them. Agreed. I think we'd better stay together in case we run into any trouble out here. And stay sharp! You don't have to worry about me... I could take on a Saiyan with my hands tied behind my back! Yeah, me too! I hope... Their total fighting power is only fifteen hundred and ten! And they want to fight some Saiyans, huh? The fools! Let's go have some fun! We might as well go back, I don't think we're going to find any action here! But how do we get back? Good point. Mr. Popo didn't tell us that. Hey, maybe they're too scared to come out and fight us! I don't think so. And if you met the Saiyan Goku and Piccolo fought, you wouldn't think so either. Chiaotzu, let's go. Right... Tien, help me! Chiaotzu! Help! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Chiaotzu! Chiaotzu! What? Did I do something to tick you off? Hraagh! Watch it, Tien! They're fast! Haah! Hey, there! Were you looking for a fight? C'mon! C'mon! Yes! Hyaah! Nice shot! That tickled! Haah! It looks like we did it! Those guys were tough! No kidding. Poor Chiaotzu didn't even have a chance... Chiaotzu... We've avenged you, my friend. Haah! He disappeared! Krillin! T-They're immortal? I don't think so, they're just super strong! And if we don't watch it, the other one's gonna get us while we're not looking! Krillin! Krillin! Come on! Krillin! No! I don't care what happens anymore, I just want to beat those guys! You should never have come here! No one comes to Vegeta! He's right! We try to discourage tourism here! Hey, my grandmother can gather energy faster than that! But don't feel bad, she's one tough cookie! Alright, Yamcha! Let's give it everything we've got! Multi-Form! Spirit Bomb! Man, that was horrible! Those two guys were monsters, not men! Yes, they were. Yajirobe...? Mr. Popo? Kami? I'm alive! Chiaotzu! Kami! How'd we get here?! You never left here! You've all just been standing around like bunch of zombies! Only your physical bodies remained here. With the help of this room, your spirits made dream bodies which they used to travel to the dream-like past. So, you guys! How did it go? Speak up! Well, how did you guys do? They did very well, Yajirobe. They all faught valiantly against a very strong enemy. I should mention to you all that the Saiyans on the way to Earth are twice as strong as the ones you just fought! Twice as strong? Are you sure about that, Kami?! I can certainly understand if any of you want to back out of this deal. Believe me, there would be no dishonor in doing so. But if you must leave, go now, because there will be no looking back for those of you who remain after today. Wouldn't miss it! No, me neither! I'm in! Me too! It's settled then! We'll spend 24 hours a day in this room if we have to! We'll beat those Saiyans! Yeah! Let's get to work! Haah! Waah! Waahh! Piccolo! "Piccolo" nothing! You're getting lazy! You can defend yourself better than that! Now, show me what you can do! The race against time is on... Now that Tien and the others have had a taste of what they'll be up against when the two Saiyans arrive, they know they have a lot more work to do before they'll be in fighting shape... Goku still needs to find King Kai in order to complete his own martial arts training... And Gohan is being put through his paces by Piccolo... Will it all be enough to stop the Saiyan invasion? Or will the Z warriors find out that they are up against an unstoppable force? To find out, don't miss the next exciting episode of Dragon Ball Z!
