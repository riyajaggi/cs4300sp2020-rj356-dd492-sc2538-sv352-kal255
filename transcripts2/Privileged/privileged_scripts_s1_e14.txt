 Previously on Privileged... Zach! These are for you. Do you think it's possible that I like Luis? Kinda seemed like you did. You should have just told me you liked me. I don't. Mom's home! You gave up the right to call either one of us daughter when you walked out. Hey, Sammy. So when did you guys get back together?

 A few weeks ago. Lily got married? That sexy Sammy and her, they tied the not. That was Lily. Apparently she's in jail. Man: Attention. Visiting hours will end in 10 minutes. There is no physical contact with prisoners at any time. I didn't do it. Lily, are you ok? Wait, why do you look so good? Honeymoon tan. Right. Forgot about that. Honeymoon. Must of missed out on the registries. I didn't think you'd want to come to the wedding. I know Sammy's never been your favorite person. It's ok. I've moved on. And so now...

 We're in jail. So... I know. But I didn't do it. The backpack wasn't mine. Ok. Wait. I'm a few steps behind. What backpack? The backpack full of drugs they found in my hotel room. Oh, great. Are you dealing now? Hello. I just said- Oh, you didn't do it. Ok. I'm sorry. Um... Is it possible you married a drug dealer? It's possible. But I don't know for sure. 'Cause he took off. And that's how I wound up here. I thought you guys were in Acapulco. We were. But we were having so much fun that we decided to extend the honeymoon and road trip back home. We got to Delray yesterday. And I wanted to hit up the beach and he had some friends he wanted to hook up with, so we decided to meet up for dinner. Except he never showed. Yeah, well, you know marriage. Ups and downs. Day 3 must have been pretty tough. Are you done? Yes. I'm sorry. Sorry. Just go on. Anyway I went to look for him at the hotel. But when I got there, he was gone. Cops were everywhere. And there was a backpack full of- I don't need to know what kind of drugs. 'Cause I'm just gonna go to a happy place and pretend like it was pot. It wasn't pot. Happy place, Lily. Fine. Pot. Since the hotel room was in my name... They assumed it was yours. Geez, Lily. I just- I don't know what to do. The bail's 25,000. Oh, my god. I know. But you can get it, right? I gotta figure this out. Megan... I'll be back tomorrow. I promise. Are you ok? I mean, do you need anything? I'm fine. Ok. I'll-um- I'll be back tomorrow. Mmm. You know, I'm supposed to be putting all the fine China away. This little fundraiser isn't going to clean itself up. Mmm. Sounds like you have a lot of work to do. Mmm. Mmm. Wait. Wait. Let's slow this train down. Slow it down? The train just left the station. I know. I know. But I wanna do this right. I wanna take you out on a real date. A real date? Like a date date? Yeah, a date date. You know, dinner, movies. Anything where you can see me in something besides an apron. I like it. It's sounds very proper. Exactly. We're going to be proper. Oh, they look so cute. It's about damn time. What the heck is every- Oh. Look. Happy people. All right, that's it. Show's over. Move it along, people. Nothing to see here. You, easy-to-replace souse chef, hands off the queen bee and get back to work. And you, trouble-with-a-capital-s, stop distracting him. Pfft. Young love. Makes me sick. How'd it go? She ok? She's being held for possession with intent to distribute something very bad that isn't pot. Did she? I don't know. She says she didn't. But I don't know. The story seems a little weird. Wow. Yeah. It's like, I feel like I'm in a daytime soap opera. Where's my evil twin? In jail? Right. Can you do me a favor? Anything? Will you take me to my dad's house? Do you think she's using again? She didn't say anything anything about using. She just said that she wasn't dealing. And you believed her? Why wouldn't you believe her? Isn't she innocent until proven guilty? Not when it comes to Lily. I just keep thinking about that stupid bracelet. I know. But that was different. What bracelet? Lily stole a bracelet from the girls that I was working for. And she lied about it, pretty convincingly too. She lies about everything. She's lies about things she doesn't even need to lie about. That's the problem. The bail's 25,000. Holy crap! I know. I have about 8,000 saved. I have about 2. I can cover it. Absolutely not. Megan- No, Will, this is a family matter. I don't want you getting involved. If he wants- But I'm really happy to help- Mom, I'm serious. No. Megan, you don't have to get upset. Will, please stop. Nobody's posting bail. What?! We're not bailing her out. I could probably get a bail bond. It's not about the money. Lily needs to learn a lesson here. She's got to realize there are repercussions to her actions. And until she does, she's not gonna change. So you're just gonna let our baby girl sit in jail? If I thought she was in danger, I wouldn't. She's just scared. And you know what? She should be. The way her life's been going, being scared might be the only way to put her back on track. And believe me, this has been a long time coming. I don't know. Do you trust me, sweetie? All right then. I'll go down there tomorrow. And I'll tell her what we've decided. No, I have to go. Um, I promised her that I would be back tomorrow. And I don't want her to think that- I'll tell her. All right. Hey. Uh, Jordanna, that necklace? Yeah... I love it! Uh-huh. And... and that dress makes your boobs look awesome. You should wear it more often. Hey, guys. I hope I'm not interrupting. Hey! I was just looking for ya. Kudos on the outfit, Zachariah. No one can rock a sweater-vest like you can. Oh, there's Meredith. I haven't talked to her in for-evs. Meredith! Ok. What's with the musketeer act? What do you mean? Ok. Sage totally met someone. Isn't that great? Shut up. Sage Baker has a beau. Who is he? Vitals now. Well, he doesn't- His name is Luis. Yeah, he's their new souse chef. Zach! No stop it. Sage's new boyfriend is a domestic?! Oh... Oh! Um, well I'm not sure that she's telling people yet. So... Who are you again? I'm Zach. With a "ch" not a "ck." Do you go to this school? Of course he does. Why have I never seen him before? Because he's in all ap classes. Oh... Oh! I gotta run. Kisses. Bye. Ok, I'm sorry. I probably shouldn't have said anything about Luis, huh? Uh, it's ok. I'm just a little nervous around your friends. They're not really the group I normally hang with. I know. But you'll get used to 'em. They're pretty harmless once you get to know 'em. Oh, and for now, let's not tell Sage you're the one who outed her. Sometimes she hits. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you. Go back to sleep. What time is it? Uh... Are you going back to Delray already? Yeah, I figured I might as well get it over with, right? Did you even sleep at all? Not really. I feel sick. Megan, can I say something? Yeah. I mean, I know it's not my place, and it's not my family. But I can't help but have an opinion on the subject. I know. Well, what do you think? I think this is crazy. I mean, if this is about the money- No, it's not about that. I mean, you heard my dad. Yeah, but so what? Since when does your dad make the big decisions? And no offense, because I genuinely like the guy. But it's not as if he's the person you've been leaning on your whole life. And he's clearly got his own agenda going. Well, I wouldn't exactly call it an agenda. He's working a program. We all know the program. It's about enabling and all that crap. And I wouldn't call it crap. I didn't mean it like that. Look, you're right. It's just-I've always been the one who's had to make the hard decisions in our family, and it sucks. You know, when my dad first got laid off, I had to tell Lily that we couldn't afford to get her new school clothes. And I had to tell both of them, that we couldn't afford the house that we were living in anymore. And-I don't know. This is the first time that my dad's making a tough call. And it just-it feels nice to let him do it. Oh, I know that sounds like a cop-out No, it doesn't. It sounds like it's about time that you had a break. But do you really think that she did it? I don't know. I really, I don't know. Ok, so let's say, worst-case scenario, she did. Right. And she's go on trial, be prosecuted and do the time. If Lily really screwed up that badly, she's gonna pay a price for it. But if she didn't do it, and if she's sitting in jail right now totally innocent, and you're leaving her there just to teach her some kind of lesson, then you could lose your sister forever, Megan. I mean, forever. Is that what you want? I'm gonna need you to zippidy-do-da on the whistling. Can't help it. I'm in a good mood. Oh, yes. You and the feisty twin have finally found love. Funny how that happened just as Keith decided to terminate ours. Yeah, I heard about that. Sorry, man. It's ok. This way the world maintains a love-hate balance. I'm happy for you two high school musical-looking misfits. Now get your whistling ass downstairs and get me a case of olive oil. Good morning, Megan. Morning, Luis. Why's he so chipper? He and Sage finally decided to become all kissy kissy. Isn't it disgusting? You're kidding. That's great. It won't last. Why not? Because they're teenagers. One of them will choose MySpace the other one will choose Facebook. And then they'll never speak again. Have you ever heard of a little thing called opposites attract? If they really like each other, they'll make it work. No, they can't. Yes, they can. You're wrong. I'm right. You wanna bet? No. Because I don't want to participate in any of your bitter bets. They're gonna last. Because I need someone in this house to be happy. And it's clearly not going to be you or me. So pipe down Buzzkill McGee. If you'll excuse me, I have to go to jail now. Jail?! You heard me. Damn. She's always gotta one-up me with the drama. A hairnet? For your new boyfriend. Oh. 'Cause Luis is a chef. I get it. That's funny. Um, we're actually gonna go head out and get some drinks. Do you want anything? Um, uh, no thanks. Ok. Are you ok? Oh, please. Like I wasn't expecting this? He's poor. I'm rich. Gasp. So shocking that he did it on the first night that you went out. Don't worry. Jordanna's lame sense of humor is not going to bring me down. Wow. You really like him. I know. It's crazy, right? It's making me want to do stuff. Ah, not that stuff. It's like yell it from the rooftops and buy him a Porsche kinda stuff. But that's a great idea. Not the Porsche, but a gift. Something small to show him how psyched you are about you guys being together. Yeah, but you don't think it's too weird that I'm buying him a gift this early? Not at all. Look, it's a really nice way to show somebody that you like them. And hey, with valentine's day coming up, it's the perfect excuse. Ahh, I totally forgot about valentine's day. Thank god I have you. You're so good at this dating thing. Ok. So the real question is what to get. Sorry. Sorry, I was on the phone. Is everything ok? Actually no. I need a favor. Yeah, I know. That's why I'm here. No. No. Not my bail. I need you to call this woman Evan Cantwell. She's gonna be Sammy's lawyer. They found Sammy? No. When they do, he's gonna need someone to represent him. So... Wait a minute. You're trying to find Sammy a lawyer right now? I' already been assigned a public defender. But Sammy's gonna need someone who actually knows what they're doing. He's in some serious trouble. You're in some serious trouble, Lily! You're in jail right now because Sleazy Sammy skipped town and let you take the fall for him. Lower your voice, Megan. This is insane! Ok. I'm sitting her freaking out about you, and you're worried about your stupid deadbeat- Husband. He messed up. And don't think I won't give him hell about it. But he is my husband, Megan. I cannot believe I defended you to mom and dad last night. Mom? Yeah. Yeah, she um-she came home a couple of weeks ago. And I called you but you didn't call me back. What do you-mom's home? Lily, I need you to focus on what's happening right now. Because it's about to get worse. We're not bailing you out. What? We talked about it and well, it's obvious that you're not taking this situation seriously. And dad was right- So this was dad's idea? No. We all talked about this. Look, Lily, you're sitting her worrying about Sammy right now, which just shows me that you're not grasping what's going on here. You need to start absorbing some of this so you don't make the same mistakes over and over again. Lily, wait! You all sat around like a perfect little family and decided to leave me here? Like I'm the black sheep? I'm the problem? Lily, come back! Hello? Hey, Charlie, Sage Baker. I need you to tell me everything there is to know about your cousin Luis. What?! Mainly, I need to know what he likes. Hobbies, sports, peculiar fetishes. Yeah, uh, no hobbies. The guy's all about work. He just wants to go to culinary school, so he's pretty focused on his job Interesting. Ahh, this is perfect. Thanks for all your help. Wait, wait. Why are you asking me all these questions? Did he do something? Oh, didn't he tell you? We're dating now. Isn't that great? Thanks, Charlie. Uh, hey, you wear the same outfit as my debate team. That's cool. Yes, I see. Excuse me while go set fire to mine. Zach, what are you doing here? I have something I want to give you. And it couldn't wait. You got me a gift. Why? It's a nice way to let someone know that you care about them. It's a poem. It's not like a check or anything. That is so sweet. Nobody's ever written me a poem before. I just wanted to let you know how I feel about you. Thank you so much. Do you wanna stay and watch TV or something? Oh, I can't. I got a competition. But I'll call you later though. Yeah. Yeah. Bye. Where's your girlfriend? Oh, Mandy. She went to visit her family for a week or two. I'm not sure. Things haven't been going all that great with us lately. Ah, that sucks. Yeah. Anyway, how's aunt Marilyn doing? I haven't talked to her in a while. She's fine. How's work going? Marco's great, isn't he? You know, I bet a letter from a guy like that would really help you get into culinary school, huh? Yeah, absolutely. Come on! Block him out! This job is really important to you, right? Yeah, really important. Then why are you trying to mess it up by dating Sage Baker? How'd you know about that? Because she told me. That's right. The crazy rich girl called me. She's not crazy, dude. She just speak her mind. That's what I like about her. She gets all fired up inside. You know, that's funny. 'Cause if you date her and then break up with her, you'll get fired. And if you date her and she breaks up with you, guess what? Still fired. It's a lose-lose. Or we date, we stay together, and everything's cool. Yeah, 'cause that's gonna happen. You guys are in two completely different places, from two totally different worlds. What is that supposed to mean? It means that the situation has disaster written all over it. I just don't want to see you lose a job you really love for no reason. Well, I'll lose it anyway if I show up late. Ahh. I hear you coz. And I appreciate the advice. But the fact is, I can always get another job. I don't know if I can get another girl like Sage. Do you know what I'm saying? Yes, I do. Gotta follow your heart. Always follow your heart. You ok? Did you leave her there? It was the hardest thing that I've ever had to do. I'm not even sure that I made the right decision. If it's ok with you, I just-I don't want to talk about it anymore. It's about time. Hey, beautiful. What's up? I have a surprise for you. - What's this? - It's an early Valentine's gift Or just a gift. Valentine's day is so lame, right? Um, they're made by like W?sthof or some Germany sounding name. Apparently all the top chef's use them. Do you like it? Uh, yeah. They're great. Thank you. That's really great. You're welcome. I should let Marco know I'm here. So, yeah. "Dull sublunary lovers' love." Sublunary. Sublunary. Hmm. Earthly, mundane. Mundane lovers? That sounds bad. Sage, doesn't mundane mean boring? Basically. God, this poem makes no sense! I mean, how can love be boring and refined at the same time. What homework are you doing? I wish I was doing homework, this is Zach's crazy-hard poem about our sublunary love. He wrote you a poem? Someone's trying way too hard. Oh, no. I don't think this is hard for him at all. That's the problem. He's Mr. Ap-everything. All super smart. And he know how to use the word "'twere" in a sentence. So you're dating a nerd. So what? It's not like you didn't know that going into it. I know. I just didn't know it was going to be this hard. Men are so difficult. Hmm. Well, what happened to you? Oh, my God, did you give Luis the knives? Yeah, and he hated them. He did? I don't know. I think he did. His reaction was all bizzaro. I can't believe I missed the gift giving. Well, ok. Wait. What did he do exactly? He was like. Then he's like. Thanks. They're great. But in a way that was totally false. Well, maybe you got the wrong ones, like the wrong size or something. Hey, girls, ready to do some bio. Megan, do you know anything about knives? I already don't like where this conversation is going. Forget it. Don't worry about it. Ok. If he doesn't like them, then I'll just return them. Oh, my gosh. Did you get Luis knives? Stop smiling. That's so sweet. What a thoughtful gift. I bet you he loved them. Well, you would lose that bet. Oh, I feel so bad. This is all my fault. I never should have told you to get him anything until we knew exactly the best thing to get. It's ok. No. It's not. Ok. We're both gonna put our thinking caps on. And we're gonna come up with something so much better. All right. And I promise to be there for you so we can analyze his look as a team. Really? Mm-hmm. I love you. Are you ok? Yeah, I just got something in my eye. She keeps getting weirder and weirder. Look, it's not that I wasn't listening to you. It's just that, I don't know, I started to realize that maybe some of the things that you said yesterday weren't totally accurate. Like what? Ok. I don't think that we've been enabling Lily her whole life. If anything, I feel like she's been left to fend for herself in a lot of ways. I left for school when she was only 16. You weren't functioning at the time. And well, mom- Wasn't there at all. I know. None of us were though. I mean, I bailed Lily out of a few things at school. But big picture, she was left by herself. She's right, Artie. When I see Rose and Sage together, it makes me feel like the worst sister ever. They would never do this to each other. You know, if Rose was a serial killer, Sage would stay in jail with her just to braid her hair. Can I tell you something? You have a heart made of solid gold. Doesn't feel that way. I know you want to do what's best for Lily. And I know that this feels wrong to you. But it's not. How do you know that? Because I've been where Lily is right now. I hit bottom. While I was on my way down, I had a friend who kept trying to help. Who? Just a friend. I got used to him coming by everyday checking up on me. The day he didn't, I was terrified. I was too ashamed to call him. Took me almost a full week to realize I was on my own. That's when I got my crap together. When I got out of rehab, he was the first person I called. I owe him my life. What if she can't get her life together. She's just a kid. Oh, Lily's a fighter. She always has been. When she turns a corner, we're gonna be here waiting for her as a family. Ok. I get it. Knives aren't romantic. But I was just trying to do something nice. It was a nice gift. In fact, it's exactly what I've been wanting. Look, I've been saving up for those knives for almost two years now. Ok. So you're upset because I got you something you wanted? I'm not upset. Ok? It's just... It's hard to explain. Look, it seems like we're in a win-win here. I can take all the money you were saving and buy me something nice. It's like the gift of the magi, except in our version everyone gets what they want. Yay for us. This is something I wanted. But that's why it was important for me to earn it. It was a goal of mine. But you swooped in and you beat me to that goal. Does that make sense? No. All I know is I spent a lot of time thinking about what to get you. And now you're all upset because I ruined your knife dream. Sage, don't you understand- Don't you understand how hard it was for me to find the perfect gift?! Do I go big and flashy? Or do I go small and subtle? Do I get him something meaningful or something practical? Oh, and don't spend too much money or he'll freak out. Oh, I was wondering when that was going to come up. Oh, whatever. We both know I have more money than you, so what? So what? Yeah. So what if I buy something that you would have gotten yourself in two years? It's just stuff. It doesn't mean anything. It meant something to me. Oh, blah blah blah. You know what? If it's such a big deal, then don't use them. Ok? Take them back to the store or throw them out the window for all I care. I'm sorry I got you a present in the first place! Thanks for meeting me, Will. I'm sorry to call you out so late. It was not problem. Is Megan here yet? No, I didn't call her. She's a wreck. Poor thing was over at the house today, and she was shaking. And I don't know what to do. But I know how much you care about her. So I was hoping that maybe you could tell me what she's thinking. I'm not sure what she's thinking. But I do know that she's having a rough time with this decision. 'Cause it's a damn fool decision and that's why. And I can't argue with Artie. This whole thing's really my fault in a round about way. And everybody knows it. It's like the pink elephant in the room, if you know what I mean. I do. But I don't think this is all your fault, Shelby. You're sweet. I saw Lily today. After Megan left the house, I had to go and see for myself. How's she doing? She's terrified, of course. Megan does not want to leave her sister in that jail. And you know that. It's the decision that she made. Whether or not she thinks it's the right decision, I don't know. But you don't think it is. No, I don't. Me neither. I need to put this family back together again. For the first time in my life, I want to be the one to make things right. But I don't know how to do it by myself. I need your help, Will. Hey, Marco said you weren't feeling well. You have a cold? Yeah, sure. That sounds good. I'm not going to school. Is this about Luis? You got the boy blues written all over you. Way worse than a stuffy nose. Seriously, I want to hurl. Did you guys have a fight? I don't know. I guess. This whole thing was such a stupid idea in the first place. Well, that's too bad, because I thought you guys made a really cute couple. Me, too. Then he got all wounded bird over the stupid knives thing and his stupid goals. And I don't know. We're too different. So whatever. Ok. For future reference, it's probably not the best idea to tell someone that you like that they have stupid goals. I only said that because he made me feel bad. Obviously, I don't think his goals are stupid. I know that. And the fact that you're different doesn't have to be that big of a deal. I mean, look at me and Will. Good point. I mean, Will's ever richer than us. And you look even poorer than Luis. His family's awesome. And yours is- A band of gypsies. Yes. I know. Look, when Will and I first started dating, I never thought it would work. But we stuck it out. We had the fights. And you know, this past week, Will's been more amazing than I ever thought possible. You guys can have that. You just gotta fight for it. I'm willing to fight for it. I just don't know what he wants from me. Well, then go back. Figure out where he was coming from last night. Sounds to me like maybe you let your pride get in the way before you could understand what Luis was trying to tell you. Well, maybe if he spoke better English, I wouldn't have to try so hard. Sage... I'm just kidding. Hmm. Marco, are you good with vocab? Well, it depends, I'll need the word in context. And even then I'm not making any promises. Oh ok. Ok. How about this one? "Such wilt thou be to me, who must-" "Like th'other foot obliquely run, "Thy firmness makes my circle just, And makes me end where I begun." What the "h"! Did you help Zach write this poem? Nope, and I didn't help John Donne write it either. Who is John Donne? The guy who wrote the poem. Stay with me honey. Oh, my god. He totally lied to me. Men. So typical. They just tell you what they think you want to hear. A bunch of liars. I remember when Keith and I first started dating. He told me he was a black belt in kung fu. So I playfully tried a Charlie's Angels karate kick on him. Turns out he wasn't a black belt, but a big fan of Jackie Chan movies. Oh, I took him out with one kick. And I was wearing sandals. Poor guy. He had a big old bruise for weeks. You miss him don't you? That old hag, he had his chance. Not for a second. Now you missy, need to march over to that sorry boyfriend of yours and give him hell. 'Cause no one tries to pull a fast one on my Rose Baker. What the- Dad, call me as soon as you get off the boat. We need to talk. You're never gonna believe what happened. Well, actually I don't even know what happened. But I have a pretty strong idea. And if I'm right, heads are gonna roll. Unless I'm wrong. Ok. Slow down. Lily is out of jail. Which means someone bailed her out. I called Dale and all of her friends. They don't even know what I was talking about, which just leaves my dad. Even though that makes no sense. Why do you have that face? Before we get into this- Get into what? Are you happy that she's out? It's important I know the answer to that before I tell you everything. Oh, my god. No, it's not what you think. Did you go down there and bail Lily out of jail? No, I didn't. I didn't go down there. And I didn't see Lily. Your mom went. What?! She called me and told me that you were gonna be there. I can't believe this is happening. Will you let me finish? Did you go behind my back and talk to my mom about this? She called me. I don't care! Megan, calm down. You gave my mom the money to bail Lily out of jail, didn't you? Yeah, I did. But only because- There is no because. You went behind my back after I specifically asked you not to do anything at all. But you obviously weren't happy with the decision. I mean, even your mom could see that. That isn't the point. Ok. This is my family. You have no right. Do you know how humiliating this is going to be for my dad when he finds out what you did? You just throw down $25,000 like it's 25 cents and make this huge decision. It was your mom's decision. She wanted to help. I just wanted to help her help you. You weren't helping me. You did what you thought should be done. You thought we were making a mistake and you were trying to fix it. You weren't listening to me at all. You bailed my sister out of jail and I left her there. And that makes me look like the bitch. Megan, that is not- I gotta get out of here. Hi. Do you have anything you want to tell me? Anything at all? Because now would be the time to share. Well- You didn't write this? Yeah, I know. What, do you think I was too dumb to figure it out or something? What? No. I mean, I didn't at first. But I did eventually which is all that counts. I feel terrible, Rose. If it makes a difference, I totally feel exactly what the poem is saying. Why would you lie to me so early in our relationship? I mean, that is something you do in, like, week 2 when things get really hard. I'm so sorry. I didn't plan on lying to you. I swear. But when you assumed that I wrote it for you, I just couldn't bring myself to tell you the truth. Why not? 'Cause you thought it was cool and all I want is for you to think that I'm cool. Since I'm obviously not. Come on, you're cool. I watch jeopardy, Rose. I'm in band. Not a band, but band. These are not cool things. And plus it's pretty lame getting a poem off the internet and calling it your own. And even lamer than the first poem I actually did write. Wait. So you did write me a poem? Yeah. See! Now this is awesome. There's rhyming and short words. This is so much better than that other one. Seriously? Zach, you need to remember who you're dealing with. What do you mean? Well, that other poem- it was a nightmare. Do you know how long it took me to figure out that the beaten gold was a metaphor for the separated lovers? It is? I never got that. You didn't? No. You're way smarter than you think, Rose. Shut up. You're just saying that to be nice. No. I'm saying it 'cause it's true. Well, as far as nerds go, you're even cooler than Michael Cera. Another present? Please shut up. This is embarrassing enough. Ok. So when I was little, I was totally into puzzles. Puzzles. Trying to share. Anyway, I did them all the time. I even forced Laurel to convert one of our guestrooms into a puzzle's only suite. And when I was nine years old, I got my first, 5,000-piece puzzle. Ok. I worked on it everyday during the summer, right up until the week that I went to camp. Couldn't wait to come home and finish it. But when I got back, it was already done- framed, laminated, and hanging in my room. Someone laminated your puzzle. That's not the sad part. Really, I think it might be. Laurel had her assistant do it. And then she framed it, and gave it to me as a gift. She didn't ask. She just did it. She thought it was nice, but I never got to finish my first 5,000-piece puzzle. Which totally sucked. Oh, wow. The point is, I get the knife dream. Ok? So we're not so different. End of fight. Love that story. But we are pretty different. So what?! Big whoop. Everybody's different. Megan and Will. Rose and Zach. Your parents were from two totally different cultures and they turned out fine. The point is, you promised me a date. And I just showed you my kittens in a basket. So I expect something in return. And if you make a dirty kittens joke, I will beat you with this. Would it be ok if I took you to the olive garden on our first date for a value-priced Italian meal? Just pick me up on time and we won't have any problems. Oh, I miss Keith. What do you want? Hey. I have a client coming in. Lily, I want to help you. Yeah? Little late for that. No, it's not. Look, I made a mistake. I should never have let you stay there. But I thought I was doing the right thing. And the point is is that you need help. And I want to be here for you. And now is really the most important part. I mean, you're gonna Need a good lawyer. And I would rather help you pay for someone decent, then have you- What are you talking about? A public defender is not going to be good enough. Are you on crack? I don't need a lawyer anymore. The charges against me were dropped. What? They found Sammy. Idiot was on his way back to Acapulco. When did this happen? Yesterday. Ok, I don't understand. How do you think I got out? Well, I thought mom bailed you out. I mean, she went down there. No, she didn't. I never saw mom. What? No one ever came to see me but you. Hey, honey. You staying for dinner? Where's mom? Not back yet. Went to get her hair done this afternoon. What time did she leave? Not sure. Been on the boat all day. You know how long these things take. Your mother loves her beauty parlors. It's after 6:00. Most beauty parlors are closed by now. Ah, right. Well, I'm sure she's on the way home. I don't think she is. I think she is gone. Revised and edited by ju.vianna
