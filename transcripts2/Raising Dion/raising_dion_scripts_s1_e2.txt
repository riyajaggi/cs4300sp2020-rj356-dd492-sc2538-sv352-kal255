 Um, this call is for Charlotte Tuck. Don't know if anyone is gonna hear this, but, uh, I found your number in my, uh, husband's jacket. Mark Warren. The police report said that Mark... tried to... save a stranger, which... sounds like Mark. See, I found your number in his jacket... [inhales] uh, which means that you weren't strangers. Um... So, if there's something I should know about my husband... And, um... I'm not accusing you of anything. I, uh... [exhales] I'm just trying to find out who I was married to. So... call me back? [chuckles] Uh, 404-555-0119. Thanks. [disconnects call] [sighs] [groans] [knocking] [Dion groaning] [birds chirping] [knocking] [indistinct police radio chatter] - Morning, ma'am. - [Nicole] Hi. I'm Deputy Miller. And you are? Nicole Warren. - You alone? - No, my son. - He's sleeping. - Hmm. Is there a problem? Have you seen this woman? No. Who is she? Her name's Jill Noonan. She owns a cabin on the other side of the lake. She went missing last night - in the middle of that freak storm. - Oh. Didn't last long, but Jill's boyfriend said she went outside to check it out. Next thing he knew, she was gone. Of course, that's his story. See any strange people around here last night? Well, if you see anything, give a call. I'll be patrolling the area. [engine turns over] [vehicle departs] [breathing heavily] [cell phone rings to Stranger Things theme song] [grunts] Hey. I-I woke you up. [Pat] Uh, no. No, no. What's up? What's... You sound out of breath. I... I was just talking to a cop. Apparently, a woman went missing at the lake. - Are you at the lake? - [Nicole] Yeah. I just needed to get away for a little bit, you know? Um... [inhales] Listen, what do you know about Charlotte Tuck? [Pat] Charlotte... - You mean the... the... um... - The woman Mark died trying to save. Yeah. [stammers] I don't know anything about her. Why? You didn't know that he was going to New Orleans to see her? [Pat] He didn't tell me he was going to New Orleans. And you remember how he was those last couple months, he wasn't saying much. Wait, why are you asking me this? [Nicole] I found Charlotte's number in Mark's jacket pocket, which meant that he knew her or that he was going there looking for her. [Pat] Wh-Why? [inhales] Oh, no. No, Nicole. He... He wasn't... That wasn't Mark, okay? Yeah, well... I mean, Mark wasn't Mark. [Pat] You know what? Just don't call that number, Nicole. Nothing good is gonna come of it. [sobs] Ugh! Yeah, I... I left a message. I... [sniffles] I don't know what was going on, but something was going on, and I feel like I'm losing my mind, and I just... [sniffles] Everything I thought was real isn't, and I just... I really need to talk to her. [Pat] Okay, look. She could be a nutjob for all we know. All right? You're in a... a vulnerable state. She could prey on that, come after you for money. So just let me do some research, figure out who she is before you talk to her. Okay, p-promise me that you won't talk to her. Hey, look, I didn't call to get you to do anything. [Pat] No, I know. I know. I... I actually... I... I want to. Um... Here, uh... Why don't you just, uh... give me her number, so I can... You know, actually, I think I should just do this myself. Um, Mark would want me to do it. Don't tell me what Mark would want. [sighs] Sorry. [Nicole] Sorry I woke you up. He was like my brother, Nicole. [exhales] I know. Bye. [call disconnects] When can I go back to school? Uh, not until we get you under control. Dad was right here. I know. I just don't understand, you know? He was here. I saw him. [Nicole] Okay. Just... Here, come here. Let's... Let's take a walk down to the lake. I got my powers. Maybe that's why he came back. You mean you brought him here? No, he wanted to help me, or warn me, or... - something. - Warn... Warn you about what? I don't know. Superhero stuff. But who were all those other people? Maybe they came to warn their kids. Maybe. How you feeling today, buddy? Fine. Why? I want to see if you can try to bend the trees again. But gently. - Can we go swimming? - Not right now, buddy. - Did you try and bend the trees? - They don't want to. Well, what about the fish in the water? Can you try bringing them up again? Uh, I just had breakfast. What about this? - Can you try and make this float? - What are you doing? I'm trying to find out what you can do, or else we can't go back home. - I want to back to school. - Okay. So help me out, you know? - [insects buzzing] - Ladybug! [Dion] Oh. False alarm. [sighs] Dion, I really, really, really need you to focus right now. You know what? Here. Just stand in front of me. I... I am gonna show you... how to be a tree. Let's get centered, okay? Copy everything that I do, okay? Bring it right down to the center. Balance on one leg. Bring it up here like this. Just take in every... [exhales] single... - moment. - [gasps] All right, you know what? Let's try, um... Let's try an easier one. Let's do downward dog. Okay? Same thing. [inhales deeply] [exhales deeply] But you stick your butt up in the air, and you just relax. [Dion farts, laughs] [Nicole] Dion. I am not taking you to yoga class. Squirrel! [squirrel squeaking] Hey, squirrel. Squirrel! Squirrel, wait for me! [squirrel squeaking] [Dion panting] You think you're faster than me? I'm right behind you! [panting] No fair, you have a tail! Get back here, squirrel! [squirrel squeaking] Hey, no climbing! [gasps] Mom! Get me down! Oh, my God, Dion! How did you get up there? [Nicole panting] Okay, just hold on, okay? Uh... Uh, hang on, don't move. I'm gonna help. Okay, baby, just don't let go, okay? Um... - Help! - Okay, honey, just hang on. [Dion wheezing] [Nicole] Okay, um... [panting] Dion, are you all right? Where's your inhaler? [wheezing] You're gonna be okay. I'm gonna get the inhaler. I'm gonna get a ladder. I'll be right back! Just need to get the ladder, babe. I'm gonna be right there, okay? Um... Um, I... Just one second, babe. [wheezing] Please be Christmas Day. [breathing heavily] Okay. [whimpers] [Dion] Mom! [Nicole] I'm coming! [panting] Okay, buddy. I'm coming for you, okay, baby? - [panting] - Hold on tight, okay? [grunting] [Dion panting] [breathless] All right. I got you. I got you. [grunts] I just... You can hold on to me if you need to. Okay? - Deep inhale. - [inhales] [both exhale] I was scared. I got you. I got you, buddy. Okay. [panting] You're good. - [insects buzzing] - [birds chirping] [cell phone rings] Hey, I'm really busy right now. Can I just... I'm busier, so let's make this fast. - First off, how are you? - [Nicole] Um, you know... Is Dion okay? [Nicole] Other than the asthma attack he had 20 minutes ago? But he's okay? [Nicole] Yeah, he's just resting. I'm actually just waiting for the pharmacy to open. [Kat] Pharmacies are 24 hours. - Not at the lake. - [Kat] What are you doing at the lake? You know what? Never mind. How fast can you come back? We lost somebody in the communication department, and I got you an interview. Oh. - Oh, wow, okay. - [Kat] Yeah, it's creative. You'd be writing copy, sending out press interviews, and we're only two minutes from Dion's school. Unless you found another job since the last time I talked to you? [Nicole] No. I really appreciate it. Um... Can I come in a couple days? Sure, and you can meet the person that got the job instead of you. This is a salaried job with medical. There's a line of people that want this job, and I teed you up. Why are you not in the car already? - Okay. - Okay? [Nicole stammers] Yes. Yes, I... I will be there. All right. Be here by one o'clock. Love you. [disconnects call] Can't I just go to school? Not yet, baby. We don't need the kids at school to see you poof from one place to the next. That would make me so cool. Hey, you cannot let them see it, okay? This is very dangerous, Dion. I don't want someone else deciding what happens to us, okay? It needs to be me. I decide. No powers in public. Okay. Thank you. Let's go. Wait! I need to do something. [Nicole sighs] What... what are you doing? We're not gonna make it there on time. [inhales] [sighs] [Dion] Come on, let's go. - [Nicole sighs] - Come on, Mom. Okay. All right. Okay, let's go. [indistinct chattering] You'll have better luck on Tinder. [sighs] Did I ask you? [inhales] Oh, hey, Suzanne. Pat. [clears throat] Um... Uh... Pretty big fan of the peach. [chuckles] But that's... Yeah, strawberry is always a crowd-pleaser. [inhales] Um, while I have you here, I... I took a fresh look at the data sets from the Icelandic event using the new Cray XC40, and, um... it's led me to some really interesting insights from a magnetohydrodynamical... [inhales] perspective. Um... [clears throat] and I know you're swamped, so I actually... I wrote up a research proposal, which I... Oh. Which I... - I just sent you. - [message transmits] See? Yeah, so you will get that. Uh... And, look, I-I know that engineers are expected to stay in their lane, but I... I just... I... I feel like I can contribute way more than just... just... building gadgets for scientists, 'cause I-I have some ideas that you... Well, you'll see. Uh, let me know what you think. [inhales] [hip hop plays on car radio] They, um... they say it's been canceled. I lost my job two days ago. No. Um... It's supposed to be good until the end of the month. I'm so sorry. Look, if it helps, I understand how frustrating this must be. It doesn't help, actually. I said no. Okay, well, he needs his inhaler. What am I supposed to do? Well, without the, uh, insurance, it's 65. Sixty-five? - Yeah. - With the co-pay it was five. I'm sorry. Okay. I can't take a credit card. I can do a debit. [sighs] Here. And just your PIN. [keypad beeping] Okay. All right, well, that went through. I'll be back in a jiff. - Hey, why aren't you listening to me? - It wasn't... See? Here you go. Would you like the candy bar, too? - Sure. - Okay. That'll be a dollar six. Okay. You guys have a great day. Thanks. Hey! What are you doing? Run. Run. Hey, get back here. Hey! Run! - [man] Hey, lady, get back here. - Come on, buddy. Get in the car. [siren wailing in the distance] - [telephone rings] - [women speaking over PA] Hi, Auntie Kat. Hey, buddy. - Thank you so much for doing this. - You brought him to your job interview? - Well, I didn't have a choice. - Why? - You know why. - So we're gonna do this again? I feel like I should be calling social services. - That's not funny. - Damn right it's not. I am not making it up. - Then let me see them. - What? If he got these magical powers, let me see them. - Here? It's too dangerous. - Do you hear yourself? He can't control it. Last night he pulled a tree out of the ground. Okay. Here's what I think. You are in no position to sit through a job interview. And I don't want you messing this one up. So go home, okay? I'll come by and check on you when I get off. Miss Warren? Hi, I'm Rob Michaels, Head of HR. - Oh. Hi. - You ready? - Yeah. - Yes. Break a leg, Mom. - Is this your son? - Uh, yes, that's Dion. Yes, a little school snafu. I'm gonna sit with Dion while you get to know Nicole. Great. Shall we? - Yeah. - [Kat] Mm-hmm. Yeah. Uh... Uh, hold on one sec. I'm sorry. Please. [game music plays in earbuds] Thank you. [whispers] You got this. Okay. - Thank you. - Please have a seat. So... how are things with you and your mom? Huh? So, have you ever worked in a hospital before? Um, no, but I was pre-med for a couple years at Spelman. - Yes! I'm eating all the diamonds. - [Kat laughs] [cell phone vibrates] Sweetie, I gotta take this call. Let's... Let's go in that office. Tell me about this job at The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. It says you covered the Atlanta club and party scene. Quite the partier, were we? You know, I, um... I did my research. - [Kat] I will be right back. - Okay. All right. Be right back. - Hello. - High score! [computer voice laughs] God, nuts! [man] Really? Video games at work. Uh... I don't answer to you. - One more game. - [Dion] Okay. - I got a question. - [Pat] Mm-hmm. Shoot. How did Peter Parker keep going to school after he was Spider-Man? Well, he wore a costume when he did super stuff. Nobody knew who he was. I need a costume. Does your mom know how to sew? She tried to teach me how to focus today. [Pat] Oh, like Yoda with Luke Skywalker, eh? Is she trying to be your Yoda? Because she can't. You know, it has to be somebody not in your family. I'm your Yoda, right? Of course, I am a little better looking than Yoda, so let's just call me a mentor. You're more of a sidekick. [scoffs] What? Like you and my dad. Pat, are you there? What I meant was you'd be a great mentor. Are you asking me? Want to be my mentor? [gasps] I'd be honored, sir. Of course, I do know everything, so if you have any questions, just ask. - I got a question. - [Pat] Uh-huh. How do you like getting beat, mentor? [chuckles] Oh! [stammering] Dion, I... I lost you. First in the morning, last to leave at night, and on occasion you would be needed on weekends. Is that something that you can handle? The battery died. Miss Warren? Um, that is not a problem. I am available. [Rob] Um... - Do you speak any other languages? - [Nicole] Um... [in Spanish] I speak Spanish. [laughs] Okay. Okay.

I would just need you to make sure you're... No, no, no, no. Miss Warren? Dion! Dion! Are you done yet? Pick up your stuff. Let's go. Yay! Hey. What's going on? Are you done? What happened? Dion... - I'm sorry. - Thank you for your time, Miss Warren. - Girl, what did you do? - Thank you. - She said we're going home. - Okay. Bye, buddy. Bye. I'm sorry. Okay, wait till we get in the car. I'm serious. Kat, you butt dialed me again. [Kat] No, I actually meant to call you this time. - Ooh. - It's about Dion. Is he okay? Yeah. He's fine. You... You see him pretty regularly, right? I try to make it once a week, but Nicole's not always, you know... up for it. Do you feel like she's trying to keep him from you? No, I think she has her hands full and... Uh, yeah, and you can be kind of annoying. Right, but ouch. Pat, you know I love you. Does he ever say anything about her? Is he ever upset by anything she's doing? Uh, he says she's sad sometimes, but that makes sense. Why? She's just... She's... She's acting weird. She said that Dion... What? No, nothing. She used Dion as a reason to mess up her job interview today. Oh, yeah. Yeah, he messaged me to play Reptile Repo. [Kat] You were playing video games with Dion in the middle of the day? How old are you? Twelve? Don't you got a job? [Pat] Yes, I have a very creative job, and I make my own hours, and that's not the point. The point is Mark made me promise to look out for Dion, so when Dion calls and says he's bored because he's waiting for his mom who's trying to get a job, I try to help. So, she didn't get the job? It was like she was trying to sabotage herself. - Do you want me to talk to her? - [woman] Doctor. No. Please, don't do anything. Do not tell her that I called you. Okay, I won't. But look, I understand why you're worried. She's trying to handle everything by herself, and... [inhales] [sighs] I mean, she's even trying to be Dion's Yoda. - What? - [Pat] I know, right? Anyway, she's just more stressed than normal. Well, maybe you can check in on her. Just do that thing where you show up where you're not wanted. Excuse me? You know, when you show up not invited, not expected. Mm-hmm. Okay, just stop talking. Yes, I will drop by and say hello. Just be cool. Um... I'm Mr. Cool. - Right. - Oh, and Kat, hey. Maybe you could work on your, uh, people skills just a little teensy bit. - Bye, Pat. - [chuckling] Bye, Kat. [disconnects call] [Dion] Babyproofing? I'm not a baby. [whirring] Well, we don't want things flying around the room. Whoa, cool! Can I have these? You can play with them. I am Goggleman! Goggleman away! I am Broomface. I am Plunger! [grunting] You took away my power! - Oh, no, it's wet! - [water dripping] [whirring] Hammerhead! Hammer, hammer, hammer, h... Stop. Please, will you just let me finish doing this so the furniture doesn't fly around the house? I need a costume so I can go back to school. Like Peter Parker. [banging on door] Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Come here. Go to your room and do not make things fly. - Watch out, bad guy. - Thank you. Here comes Hammerhead. [objects clattering] - [banging] - [Nicole sighs] You're not allowed to drill into the wall. It was the TV. - Sounded pretty real to me. - George! Why are you hassling her? - You still haven't fixed my sink. - I'll get to it. - Don't give me "get to it." Get to it. - Soon as I'm done here. [boy] According to the renter's agreement, the super cannot inspect an apartment without 48 hours notice. Oh. All right. All right. [woman] Go on. Malik'll show you. Malik, watch him. And do something about these ants around here. Thank you. [exhales] We watch out for each other. I'm Tessa. Nicole. Uh, we're just settling in. I should have said hi by now. You got coffee? I hate being in my apartment with George. That man does not understand the volume of his voice. Can I come in? Oh, uh... - I'm gonna come in. It's okay. - Okay, okay. Um... Dion, I have company over. Stay in your room. Okay. [makes shooting, explosion sounds] You babyproofing? - How old's your son? - Um... Seven. Almost eight. But you know how boys are. They're always finding new ways to hurt themselves. [scoffs] You're telling me. The other day, my son Malik and his friend were playing a game where they just threw each other down the stairs. [laughs] - [cell phone rings and vibrates] - Oh, um... Excuse me. - Hey, Pat. - So, I found your Charlotte Tuck. I thought I told you I was gonna do that. I know, but, uh, I found a low-res pic in an article on Mark's death, and, um, it was... it was pretty crappy, but I have a friend who works in DARPA, and he's developing a next-level facial recognition algorithm, and I talked him into letting me try it out. - Why? - Why? [chuckles] Um, she seems pretty normal. Divorced. Uh... learned how to make stained glass for some reason. And then, the trail... goes cold. What do you mean? Well, there's nothing anywhere on Charlotte Tuck after August 12th, 2017. That's the day that... Mark died. I know. Um... It looks like she just... went off the grid. Or worse. Wow, so... - that's it. - [Pat] Well, let's not... Let's not give up hope yet. Um... You still have that phone number, right? If you want to give that to me, I could... - Uh, no. - [Pat] Okay. Um... Well, I'm on my way home, so I could come by and we can talk about it. No, I've got company. Yeah, oh, cool. All right. Uh, no problem. [Nicole] Um, but, uh... thank you for... for doing that. Of course. - [Nicole] Bye. - Yeah, bye. Would you like cream or sugar? I like it creamy and sweet. Man troubles? Ugh... no. That was just Pat, who is a man, technically. He's Dion's godfather. Sounds like he's up in your business. [Nicole] Yeah. And how your business feel about that? Mm, mm-mmm. I've been through too many of his girlfriends - to be interested in any of that. - Well, what's his deal? [banging] Girl, what, you running from the cops or something? [chuckles nervously] [suspenseful music plays] [banging] I brought Dion's homework. Thank you. I will make sure that he gets it. My dad's parking the van. He'll be up when he's done. - Okay, then come on in. - [Esperanza] Thanks. - Uh, it's Esperanza, right? - Yep. - Awesome. Esperanza, this is Tessa. - Hi. Hi, I'm Dion's best friend, but he doesn't know it yet. Okay. I am the Mind Mover. I move things with my mind. [yells] [clattering] Hey, what's going on in there? Nothing! [Nicole] Are you okay? Yeah, why? Esperanza's here to see you. - Dion? - [Dion] Dion's not here. I am Mind Mover! Would you mind moving on back so I can roll in here? I have some thoughts on your fort. [sighs] It is a lair. What's wrong with it? For starters, it's not wheelchair accessible. I didn't know you were coming over. Well, I'm here. [sighs] [grunting] - So this Pat guy's not an option? - You know... [exhales] He comes on too strong. There was one girl that actually really liked him. Even she couldn't handle it. You know, he's just got no chill. Well, he needs to calm down. Ugh, he needs to listen. I specifically told him not to get involved in a certain thing, and then he just... couldn't help himself. Well, you know saviors. Gotta be saving. [Nicole] Mmm. Okay, lair is up to code. You won't get fined by the city. Great. Now I need a new costume. Why? 'Cause you saw it. [Nicole] Esperanza, your father's waiting for you downstairs. [Esperanza] Okay. Don't change your costume. It's too good. Besides, I'm the only one who's seen it, and I'm invisible. [inhales, exhales deeply] I am Mind Mover. - Bye. - Bye. [Nicole laughs] Thanks again for dropping off the homework. [Esperanza's dad] Sure, no problem. [grunting] Come on, bad guys. Mind Mover's ready for you. [car door closes] [Pat] Nicole. Hi. It's all right. Don't worry. I'm just dropping this off. I brought some, uh... some Chinese food for you and Dion. You sounded a little tired when you were on the phone, so I thought I'd save you the trouble of making dinner. - [clears throat] - You didn't have to do that. I know. Um, and I also brought you dessert. So... And I thought maybe we could talk about Charlotte Tuck for just one more minute. Yeah, keep driving, bad guys. - What are you doing, Pat? - About the... The full-court press. I mean, I ask you one question about the woman, and you've become obsessed. [scoffs] I'm interested. It's interesting that there's a mystery to be solved. This isn't a game, okay? We're talking about my husband. Yeah, and my friend, who was lying to both of us. And that's not the Mark I knew, so I want to understand what happened, and, yeah, I want to talk to the last person to see him alive. [inhales] [sighs] Why don't you want me around? I mean, I know we... we had a rocky start when you and Mark first got married. You called me a train wreck. [scoffs] Why did he... tell you that? I didn't say it like that. - Okay, then, how did you say it? - It was... It was a more supportive way of saying train wreck. Ah. - Look, okay. - Right. You took my best friend. You came out of nowhere. You made him ridiculously happy. And I couldn't keep a girlfriend to save my life. And... - I was a jerk. - Yeah, you were a jerk. I was. I totally was. But... now I'm not. And now I just... wanna help. I... [inhales, sighs] [voice wavers] I keep wondering if there was... something that I could have done to... you know, change things, and... if he'd talked to me, maybe. But Mark had that thing where... A man handles his problems on his own. Yes, exactly. And I know he thought he was being strong, but... it just made me feel shut out. But anyway, uh, I'm gonna go. This is for you, or it's for the trash. Good. Thank you. Um... And look, if you ever decide that you want any help, especially if it involves garlic beef... uh, just... call me. You'd be doing me a favor, on many levels. So... Hey, Pat. Wait. Yeah, what is it? [child] My bunny! - The doll! She dropped her doll. - [banging] Move... now! Thank you. Oh, yeah, sure. Move... now! Move... now! Mister, I've got your doll. Dion! [Dion screams] [Nicole gasps] Oh! Oh, my God. [sobbing] Oh, my God. You could have been killed! [sobbing] [dramatic music plays]
