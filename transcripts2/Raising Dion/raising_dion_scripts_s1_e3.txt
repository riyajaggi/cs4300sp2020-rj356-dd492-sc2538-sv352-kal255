 [Pat] You sure, buddy? It'll be fun. [imitates plane thrusters] They don't want to. They? It's how he make sense of it. It's not him actually moving it, it's the things doing it themselves. Hey, do you want some hot chocolate? So, you're telling me that Kylo Ren wouldn't want to take out Luke's X-wing right here, right now? Because, I mean, if I were Kylo Ren,

 I would wait just beyond X-wing tracking capabilities, and then when Luke finally decided to patrol the galaxy, I'd shoot up and face him and he'd have no choice. Dogfight! [makes space battle noises] Oh! Luke's in trouble. He needs help. Aah! They're on my tail! They're locked in! I can't shake 'em! Ah! Help! Rebel Alliance, where are you? [space battle noises] [space battle noises] [gasps] Curses! Now you too must die! Nuh-uh! Dogfight! Get 'em, Luke!

 Pew! Zoom! Oh! Are you kidding me? He just started doing all of this on his own a few days ago? Huh! Come on. This is so cool. Pew! [Dion making space battle noises] [Pat] Okay. All right. Whoa! Agh. Agh. Whoa, whoa, whoa! [screams] [toys clattering] Agh! [Dion] I messed it up. Dude, that was amazing! I made them crash. You know what? Superheroes crash stuff all the time. It happens, you know? It's all in a day's work. I call myself Mind Mover because I can move things... With your mind. That's very clever. I like it. Mind Mover. I don't think it's been used yet. Maybe we should just slow down with all the superhero talk, okay? These powers almost got him hit by a car. We should figure out how to get it under control before we start thinking about putting on a cape. Well, most superheroes don't wear capes. Not your point. Uh, the... the thing is, it's not his fault. You're just gonna have to have some years of training under a serious mentor. I want Pat to be my mentor. Really? I'm gonna cry. [laughs] Yes! He knows all about superheroes, comic books, science fiction... And actual science. [chuckles] When I asked you for help, this isn't what I meant. [inhales] I know, and I... I... I really heard every word. But... every superhero needs a team. - Superteam! - Superteam! Let me be part of your superteam, Nicole. I've never been part of a superteam. [Pat chuckles] Fine. - Yes! - High five! [Pat] Superteam! [voices whispering indistinctly] Are you okay? Are you feeling better? I'm glad Pat knows. Yeah, me too. Hey, get some sleep, and tomorrow we will get your little superhero situation under control. Okay. Wait! Bedtime move. Silly me. [Nicole chuckles] [Dion] When can I go back to school? When we can make sure that you won't hurt yourself. Or somebody else. Promise? [Nicole] I promise. Oh. I... Here, I... I've got it. You can just sit down, or... just relax. [Pat exhales] You okay? - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. - [crying] Hey, it's okay. He's... He's fine now. He... It's okay. You're all right. [Nicole clears throat] - Sorry. - No, are you kidding? I mean... I'm still shaking from seeing him in front of that car. And you've been dealing with this all by yourself? [Pat sighs] You know, I was thinking, I could, um... I could take him to BIONA. And just let him go nuts in the storm simulator, and get some readings on what he's able to do. No. He stays home until this settles down. - I... I don't know what we're dealing with. - Okay. It's like having a toddler all over again, but instead of wobbly legs, he... he can crash a car just by looking at it. He did that? - No. - No, of course not. Got it. Well... I mean, you've... you've power-proofed this place pretty well. Well, I don't want him to hurt himself, or... end up on YouTube. Yeah, no, you do not want the black choppers swooping in. [chuckles] - Just kidding. That... - No, but you weren't. Well, how long do you think you can keep this up? Hiding him in here? He's already missed two days of school. You know, I have to go back to work. And all he wants to do is just go be around the other kids and be normal. Yeah. Well, he just... He just needs a little control. Maybe... Okay. Maybe if... if he can... if he can have, like, a tool that will help focus his powers. You know, like, um, Green Lantern has his ring? Or... Or Thor's got a hammer, or like Cyclops' glasses. Those things aren't real. [stammers] But you don't need real. You're looking for a tool to help him focus, so that his subconscious does the work you want it to do. So you're telling me he should walk around with a giant hammer? No, like a, you know... a magic feather. Whatever. [stammers] It doesn't matter what it is, as long as Dion... believes in it. You got anything like that? [cereal clattering] - [Nicole] Dion. - Oh! It's okay, honey. Just pick up the box. Come here. I want to show you something. Am I in trouble? No. Actually, I think I got something that you're gonna like. That's Dad's watch. [Nicole] Yeah. Do you want to hold it? It's heavy. Yeah, well, it's a serious piece of equipment. Do you ever wonder why Daddy took it with him on all his trips? This watch is very special. Special, how? It was designed so that the person wearing the watch would stay calm. So, when your dad was in the middle of a really big storm... it would keep him nice and calm and focused. Why didn't it save him? Well... he wasn't wearing it. One of the gauges was broken, and, uh, he had to get it fixed. It would've protected him. [watch ticking] [Nicole] Now it can protect you. You wanna try it on? There you go. Oh, yeah. My powers are definitely more under control. Yeah? Yeah. - [Nicole] That's amazing, baby. - Can I go back to school? Not until you face the ultimate challenge. [sucks in breath] ["Yum Yum Funk" by K+Lab featuring Def3 plays] [candy wrappers rustling] [Nicole] You can do this, bud. Hey, be stronger than the Twix. Just stay focused, okay? What is more important? Having a Twix or going back to school? Huh? Huh? - [Dion gasps] - [Nicole] You did it. - Are... are we good? - [Dion] I think so. Is there anything else in here that you want? [Dion] Not more than a Twix. [Nicole] Okay. Now let's try leaving. ♪ I like the way that it tastes ♪ ♪ French vanilla, chocolate dip ♪ ♪ Butter pecan on my rocket ship ♪ ♪ When we blastin' off... ♪ And you're sure you're in control? I'm sure. If you have any problems, or if anything happens, you go straight to the office and you call me. I'm fine, I promise. Hey. You have to think about everything you do before you do it, okay? - You have to stay in control of yourself. - Mom. I'm fine. No one can defeat the magic watch. [chattering indistinctly] Can I help you? Herman Beavers. [chuckles] Nicole Warren. My son, Dion, is in this class. Oh, you're new. Yeah. We just moved here, and... And you're not feeling 100 percent confident in the new school yet. [both chuckle] I get it. You are not the first nervous parent I've met. Yeah, we've only been here a few weeks, and I... I just want to make sure that Dion's transition is smooth. Happy to help any way I can. I used to volunteer at his old school, so I got to see him more often. Well, if you ever want to volunteer here, just say the word. How about today? Uh... [stammers] We'd have to fill out some forms for the city first. And... Let's go. Right now? Oh. Yeah, okay. S-Sure. Now what do you think happens when I do this? Your hair falls out. - [laughter] - [teacher] Funny, but no. What you get is static electricity. And I could use that electricity to do this. [crackling] - [children] Wow! - Cool. Right? [chuckles] Now, for the next few months, you'll each gonna be working on a science project. When you finish, you'll be presenting at the all-school science fair. Now, this is your opportunity to get into the gifted program, okay? That's just more work, isn't it? It's more fun. Kids in the program, they get to travel to conferences, take part in the robotics competition. My dad won that in eighth grade! [teacher] Are you interested in robotics, Dion? Nice. Anyone else? - Me. - Okay. Okay. - Me! - Me! Jonathan? No? We're gonna need you, okay? You know what? Take a look at this. See, thousands of years ago, people thought that red ball in the sky was a god of war... called Mars. Scientists taught us that it was actually a planet. [girl] Wow. Then they sent up a remote-controlled robot out into space. - Sweet. - [teacher] Then we sent up another robot. See, at this very moment, Mars is inhabited solely by robots. Now, I don't know about you guys, but I think that we should get up there before those robots get any big ideas, - right? - [laughter] Yeah. Now, I want you all to find something you're really interested in learning, like defeating our interplanetary robot overlords, and make that your project. Pick a problem. Solve it with... Science! Science. Break into your groups. Uh, Mr. Fry? - Yeah. - [Dion] I wasn't here yesterday. Ow! What are you doing? I picked you when you weren't here. What's that? My dad's watch. My dad uses a calculator, but this is way cooler. What do all the dials do? Science stuff. Should we use it for our project? It's just for me. [school bell rings] ♪ Oh, yeah, now you know ♪ ♪ Bam, it's gotta go ♪ [Jonathan] Hey, Dion. - [Jonathan] You like magic, right? - Yeah. - Let me show you a trick. - You don't know magic. I learned a trick the other day. Here, give me your watch. I'll show you. Mmm... Nah. Come on, chicken. Give me your watch. [boys laugh] [Dion exhales] Be careful with it, okay? [boys laugh] Abracadabra, alakazam, make this watch disappear from my hands. [laughing] Okay, give it back. No. [laughs] I made it disappear. This isn't funny. Give it back. It's my dad's watch. It's special. I need it. Give it back. [breathing heavily] - [Dion] Give it back! - [Jonathan screams] [grunts] [children chanting] Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! What's going on out there? - What did you do to him? - He stole my watch. [Jonathan] My shoulder. - That's your watch? - It was my dad's. [Jonathan groans] Did he hurt you? Yeah. It hurts. I don't know where you came from, young man, but around here, we have a zero-tolerance policy against violence. Let's go. - I didn't touch him. - Come on. Let's get you cleaned up. - I didn't touch him. - Let's go, now. [Dion] But it's not fair! I'm trying to tell you, he took my watch and he wouldn't give it back. Hey, what's going on? - Do I know you? - That's my son. Well, your son started a fight. - Dion? - [Dion] I didn't! He took my watch. He's wearing my son's watch. He hit another student. Dion, did you hit this boy? And don't you even think about lying to me. I didn't hit him. He said he didn't do it, and this boy clearly took his watch, so why is my son the one in trouble? Because I don't believe him. I think a two-day suspension would give him some time to think about what he's done. No, you can't suspend him. [scoffs] Yes, I can. I'm sorry. Look, he's a good kid, okay, and he's new here. Is there just some way we could talk this out? - Hey, can you help me out here? - Yeah, what's going on? [Nicole] Dion says that he didn't do anything, and this kid stole his watch, but for some reason, your colleague doesn't seem to believe that. I have this under control. Jonathan, did you take the watch? For a magic trick. You didn't give it back. - It was a joke. - Wait. Wait, did... did Dion hit you? Something hit me. I... [stammers] I... I don't... No, no, no, did... did Dion hit you? I don't know. I think these boys would benefit from mediation this time around. Of course you do. Look, you can talk all you want, but this one's staying after school for an hour today. - Just my son, not the other kid? - Next time, he's suspended. Come on, man. Hey, listen. Hey. Hey, hey. - He didn't do it. - I know. I know. You're not helping. Hey, what... [Nicole scoffs] Thank you. Of course. Of course. - Can I speak to Dion for a second? - Yeah. Come on. - Did you do something to him? - I don't know. He took my watch and I got mad, and... it happened before I knew it. Okay. Hey, look at me. You can't hurt anyone, ever. Okay? Particularly with what you can do. Why didn't Mr. Campbell believe me? He assumed you were a bad kid. Why? - He, uh... - [Mr. Fry] Dion. Let's go work things out with Jonathan. Are you okay? [cell phone vibrating] [sighs] I have been working for 26 hours straight. [Nicole] Kat. You okay? [Nicole] No. [sniffles] Not really. I... I don't... I don't know. - [Kat] What's wrong? What happened? - [inhales deeply] I just stopped a teacher from trying to suspend Dion. [Kat] What? Why? He said Dion tried to start a fight with this... skater kid. [Kat] And he just assumed it was Dion. Oh, God. I don't know why you put him in that school. Can you just, please... Don't. [sighs] Sorry. Have you talked to Dion about it yet? Not yet. But you're gonna talk to him, right? He needs to know. Ah... I don't know. I mean, he's so young, and I just... I don't know. Girl, you sound just like Mama. Oh, you did not just call me that. This is Dillard's all over again. But we were in high school when that happened. He needs to know what he's up against. You think you're protecting him? You're throwing him to the wolves. He's seven years old. He's at a new school, he's... he's got no friends, and he just lost his dad. I'm supposed to tell him that the world's gonna slap him down every chance it gets? [sighs] Yes. [Mr. Fry] Anything else you want to say to each other? Jonathan? Sorry for taking your watch. Dion? Sorry you got hurt. I don't remember doing it. You'll have time to think about it after school. In detention. Now, you both are good kids, but you need to think before you act. And you need to talk it out if you get mad. If you understand what the other person is going through, you... you probably won't get into a fight. Okay? - [Jonathan] Yeah. - Yeah. Go to your next class. Why are you always mad at me? - Why are you always bragging? - [Dion] What? Your dad builds robots. Your dad wins things. He did. Well, how about you shut up about it, okay? I don't mind if you talk about your dad. Just leave me alone. Hold up. Dion? Suspended? I don't even understand suspending kids that young. Yeah, well, luckily, the science teacher stepped in, but, um... Actually, in case he calls. This teacher got a name? Anthony Fry. And he is not on my radar, okay? I do not have time for that. Maybe that's why your face looks like that. Okay, I'm just saying, I miss my girl. You been kind of disappearing on me and Liz lately. You got no man hands on you. You're not dancing. Come to a dance class with me. Get your heart pumping, those hips moving. Yeah, those hips moving. Mmm. - [cell phone rings] - You'll feel better. Um... this might actually be the school, sorry. Hello. [Charlotte] Nicole Warren, this is Charlotte Tuck. You called me. Charlotte. Uh... [stammers] Thank you for calling me back. - [Charlotte] What do you want? - Uh... It's complicated. I have a lot of questions for you, um, but I... I actually can't talk right here. [Charlotte] The swings in Perkerson Park, 20 minutes. - You're in Atlanta? - [Charlotte] Not for long. Uh, okay. Um... I'll... I'll be right there. Um, Perkerson Park and, uh... - How do I find you? - [Charlotte] I'll find you. - [call disconnects] - Hello? [keyboard keys clacking] [inhales] [elevator dings] [goat bleats] Uh... Suzanne. [goat bleats] I was just wondering if you'd reconsidered my proposal. Not since the last time you asked. [goat bleats] Okay. You need to let me look at Mark's work. I understand what he was doing better than anyone else. [stammers] Is this part of Mark's project? Should I add something to the proposal? Pat, it's not that your proposal wasn't good. Oh. Okay. But you're an engineer, not a scientist, and this lab is for scientific research. Well, maybe you could... bend the rules. [chuckles] Once. Just for... [goat bleats] ...fun. Okay. Uh, all right. Well, thank you. Thank you for reading it in the first place. [phone beeps] [line trilling] Hey. You okay? [Nicole] Um, listen, did you mean what you said earlier - about helping with Dion? - Of course, whatever you need. Could you pick him up from school today? Um... Uh, he has to stay back for, like, an hour. Um... There was an incident. What happened? [Nicole sighs] I'll tell you about it, but, um... Can you do it? Because I would ask Kat, you know, but she... she's on call again tonight. Yeah, yeah, I'm good. I can... [Nicole] Amazing. Okay, awesome. I'm gonna send you over the authorization form. So, you get a... a... another job interview or something? [Nicole] Um... Something like that, yeah. Um... But, hey, thank you, okay? Um... I... I shouldn't be too late. Well, take your time. I'll, uh... I'll handle Dion like a real superhero mentor. [chuckles] [Nicole] I'm actually kind of enjoying this superteam stuff. - Thanks. - [disconnects call] Yeah, me too. [chuckles] Oh, yeah. [children laughing] [cell phone rings] Hi. [Charlotte] We can't talk here. There's too many people. [sighs] Head back behind that stone building. I'll call you later. Okay, how do I know you're even really here? [Charlotte] I'm close enough to see you. And if I'm being honest, those pants are a little tight. What are you waiting for? I can't stick around all day. [stammers] Uh, okay. Okay, there's no one else around. [Charlotte] Tell me why you really called. I want to know why Mark was going to see you in New Orleans. [Charlotte] He was researching something that went on in Iceland. He wanted to know what I knew. - You were in Iceland, too? - [Charlotte] Yes. - So, you're a scientist. - [Charlotte] No. Then what could Mark find out from you that he couldn't figure out on his own? [Charlotte] If you're worried I was having an affair with your husband, I wasn't. Okay, well, thanks for that. But you were the last person to see him alive. [echoing] That's why you're standing in the middle of the woods by yourself talking to a stranger? - [Charlotte] Tell me what you really want. - Where are you? [Charlotte] Three seconds, and I'm leaving. One. - Two. - [stammers] Okay, okay. Um... [stammers] It's about my son, Dion. He's going through something. [Charlotte] Physical? Yes. Yes, I... I don't know how to explain it. He can do things that aren't possible. And I know it sounds like I'm crazy, but I promise you that I am not crazy. Unless, of course, I am crazy. You're not crazy. You're still here. With my dad's job, it's like I'm in detention every afternoon. [sucks in breath] It's not right that you got punished and Jonathan didn't. You didn't even touch him. Wait, you saw that? Jonathan face-planting? It was epic. Uh-oh. Don't look now. Hey. Nice sucker punch, jerk. - Let's go before his mom gets here. - [chuckles] [vehicle approaches] I like your mom. [car door closes] Hey, buddy. Pat! [Pat grunts] Oh! - How was your time inside? [chuckles] - [Dion] I don't want to talk about it. You call your dad "Pat"? He's not my dad, he's... my mentor. I'm his mentor. Ready to go? All right. - Bye. - Bye. Bye. [Dion] Bye. So what's with you getting held after school? I don't want to talk about it. [dog barks] Hey. Is that your dad's old watch? Helps with my powers. Keeps me focused. Do you like it? It's a good watch. Mmm, yeah. Got me in trouble, though. How? Hey, hey, hey, Dion. No pressure, but if you ever want to talk, I'm here and I got your back, right? It's Mind Mover and his mentor. Your shirt's gonna have three M's on it. [laughs] Well, we can... we can work on the name. [Pat chuckles] What? [sighs] The kids at school hate me. Well... then I think we gotta find some better kids, right? Let's go. - They hate me too. - [Dion laughs] It's usually a good sign. True. - I guess. - [Pat laughs] What's up, baby boy? [Dion] Hi, Tessa. [Pat chuckles] - You the one Nicole told me about? - She... she told you about me? [both laugh] Pat, right? [laughs] Yes, I am "the Pat." [both laugh] Malik. You know you don't just walk past people without saying hello. [Pat] Oh. That's all right. I... What up? - Hey, I'm... I'm Pat. - Yeah. - [Pat] Oh. - [Malik's friends laugh] - I'm sorry, I... - Boy, act right. [sighs] - Nice to meet you. - Hey, nice to meet you too. - What's good, little man? - Where you guys going? I'm about to go dunk on these fools real quick. [chuckles] - Hey, you should go with them. - Nah. Nah, old head's right. You should come with us. You know, show us your skills. Come on, let's go. Yeah. Come on. - We got nothing else going on. - [Malik] Come on. Come on. Old head's right. - I'm not good at basketball. - Yeah, but I'm the absolute worst. So let's go. - Come on. - [Dion sighs] [Pat laughs] [birds chirping] I was married 15 years, and when he left, I bought a one-way ticket to Europe, and... I was planning to get lost. That's when I found out about this... once-in-a-lifetime celestial thing in Iceland. The aurora event. It's where it all started. [sighs] I was just gonna, you know, go up and see the northern lights, maybe a comet would go by, and then... the sky... exploded. There were all these... colors. It was... the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen. And I had never felt better in my life. It was like a... drug or something. Anyway... Afterwards, I... I went home. I... I slowly got back to my normal life, but I kept in touch with a few of the people I met up there. It was years before the... weird stuff started. - Weird stuff? - [sighs] Weird stuff like how? Weird like that. Only, at first, I couldn't control it. Even after I figured it out, it took me a year to trace it back to Iceland. And how did you do that? The people that I met up there changed too, and as soon as I figured that out, Mark called. He knew something. And he wanted to talk. - But... - [sighs] how could Mark know? Because it was happening to him, too. Mark... had powers? How do you think your son got them? [hip hop plays] - Let's go home. - What are you talking about? - We're just getting going. - I can't even get the ball up that high. Well... neither can I. Why don't you try not shooting with your hands? - What are you talking about? - You know. Mmm... [imitates ball swooshing, landing in basket] Try moving it with your mind. Hey. Sit down for a second. Huddle. Take a knee. All right, so... First lesson of being a superhero is learning to use your powers without revealing them to civilians. My mom told me not to use my powers in public. That's why moms don't get to be in comic books. But I mean, I wouldn't tell her, and I think she would be upset if people saw you using your powers, but if no one knows... Or, you know, we could just let them beat us. That might be... honest. Why don't we just do that? You like losing? Let's do this. Yes! That's what I'm talking about. Watch off. Fist bump. Pffff... whoa! ♪ Whoa, get out the way ♪ ♪ Get out the way, get out the way, yeah ♪ - ♪ Yeah ♪ - ♪ Get out the way ♪ ♪ Get the... up out my way, yeah ♪ - [Dion] What was that for, man? - [Pat] Sorry. - What was that for, man? - He went between my legs. - You should have passed it to me. - [Pat groans] ♪ Win, win ♪ ♪ Win, win, win, win, win ♪ Yeah! Yeah! - Got it! - Good job. - Got it! - Good job. ♪ You either with me or ♪ - ♪ Wait ♪ - ♪ Win ♪ ♪ Win, win, win, win ♪ [Dion] Yes! ♪ Win, win, win, win ♪ Yeah! [Malik] Hey, yo, Dion. Yo. Dude, you got the best shot I ever seen out of a little dude. Like, your pops must have had a mad game. He mainly took me swimming. Um.. - And stuff down at the cabin. - The cabin? Uh, my grandfather built it with his own hands and everything. Yo, that's dope. Yo, this dude's a baller. - [man] Let's go, Malik. - All right, I'll see you, man. Later. All right, let's get this started. - All right, come on. Let's do this. - Let's go. [Malik's friends chatter indistinctly] - They didn't even see what I was doing. - No, I know. You passed your first test. Now, uh, we should probably head home before we push our luck. - My watch. - Yeah. [Dion] Thanks. [breathing heavily] But why... Why would he talk to you? You're a total stranger. He doesn't even know you. [Charlotte groans] You're one of those who think that married people have to tell each other everything? This is weird stuff! He talked to me because it was happening to me. [sighs] And he didn't want to scare you. You had enough on you with the kid. He talked to you about Dion? [Charlotte] And you. All the time. Blah, blah, blah. "I love my family." Give him a break, huh? He wanted to know what he was dealing with before he dumped it on you. And he was getting close. But he died, saving you. I'm sorry. That came out way harsher than I meant it. No, that's... That's... You're right. I wouldn't be standing here if he hadn't put himself between me and that storm. [sighs] Mark was in a storm. The night I found out what Dion could do, I mean, there were... there were people... in the rain, and... and Mark was one of them. Oh, my God. He... he was there? Mark? The thing in the storm. What... what thing in the storm? - What do you mean? - That thing killed Mark. And it wants to kill me, too. [breathes heavily] Oh... Oh... I, uh... I have to go. What are you talking about? I mean, is a storm coming to kill you? - Storms don't work like that. - [whoosh] No, no. Hey, wait. When can I see you again? Hey, I wouldn't need your help if Mark was here! You owe me! [door opens] - Hey. - Hey. [door closes] Where's my kid? He is in bed reading. Um... We had a big day today. We played some basketball. [inhales] It was pretty cool. - Okay. - [Pat chuckles] [Pat] How, um... [sighs] Mmm. How did your, uh... How'd your meeting go? I met Charlotte Tuck. What? Where? She has abilities too. She got them in Iceland. At the aurora event. That's not possible. Mark and I meticulously documented and cataloged every celestial and terrestrial anomaly... Mark had powers too. - What? - She says that... everyone that was out there got them, but, I mean... you were there. I stayed in the yurt. I was collecting data. Oh... I stayed in the yurt. That was the job. I was just... I was doing my job, so I... [gasps] So, everybody... [stammers] Everybody at that event got superpowers, and I... and I got nothing? Wow. I know it sounds crazy, but it explains everything. Dion got this from his dad. Like hereditary... superpowers? Okay, wait. I need to talk to... to Charlotte. She disappeared. Literally. There's no way to find her. Well, can you give me that number? Because maybe I can... I just have to talk to her. No, there's no way she'll come back if she doesn't trust me. Okay. Mark didn't tell me. [Pat sighs] Hey, um, for what it's worth, in comic books, superheroes usually hide their abilities from the people they love the most. Just to, you know, protect them from... villains, and aliens, and nosy reporters. But he didn't protect me. He left me unprepared. For all of this. ♪ I know we never get to talk about it ♪ [Nicole] Radiative Processes in Astrophysics? It's Dad's. I really need a good science project. Okay, but can you talk to me before you make anything radioactive, please? Mm-hmm. [laughs] ♪ But sometimes you gotta risk it all ♪ Hey, baby, I want to talk to you. I want to talk to you about what happened at school today with Mr. Campbell. - Am I in trouble? - No. No, I just wanted to see how you were feeling. I don't know. He doesn't like me. He thinks I'm a bad kid. - But you're not, right? - No. So, why do you think he thinks that? I don't know. I do. You see... You're such a special kid. You know? You're... charming, smart, very handsome... Mom. Sorry. But you're incredible. But sometimes... other people, they're going to be afraid of you. Because I have powers? No, this isn't about powers. This is about people treating you differently because... of the color of your skin. I thought Dr. King fixed that. He fixed some of it. Mr. Campbell has some bad ideas in his head, and they are telling him to treat you differently, and that's just wrong. How come he gets to act like that? That's a great question. The world's not fair. If my dad were here, he'd knock... boom! [Nicole laughs] [mimics fistfight noises] Okay. Maybe, you know? [laughs] You know, actually, I wish he was here. Because he'd be able to give you some really good advice. But I'm gonna tell you mine, okay? You have to be... more careful... than other kids, okay? You can't give... any reason for people like Mr. Campbell to try and hurt you. Hey. It's not your fault, okay? It's Mr. Campbell's fault. And it's his parents' fault, for not teaching him right. Do I still have to go to school with him? Hey. What do superheroes do when the bad guys try and get them down, huh? Do they give up? Do they stop being who they are? No. There you go. Come here. Okay. Bedtime. Come on. Bedtime move? I can put myself to bed. - Good night. - Good night. [phone chimes] [tense instrumental music plays] [music intensifies]
