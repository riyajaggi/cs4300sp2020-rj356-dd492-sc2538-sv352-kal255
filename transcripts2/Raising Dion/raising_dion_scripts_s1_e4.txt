 It's gonna be a hot one today. Thought we'd get at it early. [laughs] I'm gonna cook up some of those eggs you got from the coop yesterday. Come on. Time to reap the harvest. You ready? Yes, sir. Look. Whoa! Look at that! [chuckles] Mama's rosebush. Something dug it up. The roots are all dry, Daddy. Hold on, buddy. This was Mama's. Can you fix it?

 Let me see, son. [grunts] How's that, buddy? Thank you, Daddy. Ah, you're welcome, bud. We'll put a little fence around it so the animals stay out, okay? [voices whispering indistinctly] I mean, do you see it? There were half a dozen people in this storm, and look. You see the man? [Pat] Wow. Yeah, we need to find out who posted this. They could know about Mark. Or Dion. I mean, I searched all through the website. There's no contact info, no way to trace back to whoever came up with the site. Yes. Agh. - [grunts] Sorry, one second. - Oh, are you okay? Yeah, migraine. - [Pat exhales] - I didn't know you got those. Yes, but I'm fine. It'll, um, pass. I mean, Kat's on her way here. She could probably... That's okay, thanks. I... I... I don't want to see a doctor about it. [scoffs] Okay. Why? BIONA has these aggressive health standards for people like me, whose jobs sometimes take them in the middle of nowhere. I don't want to give them an excuse to get rid of me. Hey, they wouldn't do that. My boss does not love me. When I was Mark's engineer, I was golden, but now... [inhales] It's a... It's a headache. Uh, I can handle it. [sighs] - Okay? - Okay. - [knocking] - [grunts] [exhales] Hey. Please give this to Dion, and tell him not to be mad that I'm missing his party. - Well, you can tell him yourself. Dion! - [Kat] He's here? - Hey, Pat. - Hey. - Auntie Kat! - Hey, buddy. Mmm. Are you coming to my birthday party? It's at Andre's. His birthday's the day after mine. I know, buddy, but I can't make it this year. - I gotta work. - No. But... [gasps] You got me a present? I did. [Pat chuckles] [Pat] Oh, um, I... That's... I was working on a 1,300-piece Millennium Falcon, and I got a little... [chuckles] carried away. [clears throat] Legos and I have a... have an unhealthy relationship. You got me an iPad? I upgraded. It's a hand-me-down. Plus I turned on the parental controls, so he can't get into nothing freaky online. [chuckles] - And I downloaded Reptile Repo. - Ah! Hey, if I wanted to get him an iPad... [Kat] Come on. You can't afford that. [Nicole] I have rules for electronics, okay? An iPad, an iPhone, anything with an "i" in front of it gets monitored in this house. [Reptile Repo beeping] - It's just an iPad. - You should have asked me first. We should, uh, head out. Dion. Time to go. - [Pat clears throat] - Thank you, Auntie Kat. You're welcome. Bye, Pat. Don't forget your backpack, buddy. Shoot. - Bye, Pat. - [Pat] Bye. - Bye, buddy. - [Dion] Bye! - Last one's a rotten egg. - [Pat] Hey, hey, hey! [door closes] - He's missing another day of school? - Yeah, teacher work day. - Hey... - [papers rustling] Which means I've spent the morning trying to keep him busy, when I have five job interviews today. Willa said she would put in a word with the company. All you need to do is drop in and talk to Kwame. I don't want to talk to Kwame. And why are you talking to Willa? Because she called me. She's worried about you. She doesn't need to be, okay? I'm handling my business. Just like I did when I was in college. Oh, here we go. Your mic drop. You weren't the one that got cut off. I wasn't the one who dropped out of pre-med. Gave up food, housing, and $50,000 in tuition. Why can't you just be on my side for once? Who was at every recital? Who drove you to rehearsal? Who was the first one on their feet during every encore? - Kat... - I'm not finished. Yes, I overstep, because I care more than anybody in this world. And that means being a good auntie to Dion, and giving my little sister a swift kick when she needs one. I have always been team Nicole, so get it right, and why is there a Lego in your wall? [laughs] [both laugh] Did you catch the part where I said I have five job interviews today? Yeah, I just kind of blew past that. I will have a job by the end of today, okay? I'm good. - You promise? - Yes. Okay. And I talked to Dion about his racist-ass teacher. And what did he say? He said it wasn't fair. It isn't. All right, I gotta go. I love you. - I love you. - Oh. All right, I'll see you later. [Kat] Uh... Mmm-mmm. - [Nicole] I'll fix it. - [Kat] All right, you do that. - [chuckles] - [door closes] [Esperanza] Happy birthday, Dion. - Happy birthday, Dion. - [laughs] Happy birthday, Dion. Hey, you know there's an off-switch on that thing? Happy birthday, Dion. [turns off device] [Pat] What's going on? Are you okay? Am I gonna be homeless? What? No. Your mother has five interviews lined up. Everything's gonna be fine. Hey, do you want to hear my super nerdy theory about how your powers work? Kryptonite? What? No. That doesn't even make sense. No, I'm thinking your power comes from nature. Weather. I'm thinking it's all about ions. Ions? Mm-hmm. They're teeny tiny charged molecules, and you can't see them, but they are everywhere. - In the car? - [Pat] Definitely in the car. Here's another nerdy fact. The ions in our body are different than ions in the air. [Dion] Why? It's nature's balance. And when it rains, sometimes we feel sick, because the ions in the air alter the ions in our bodies. So, imagine a crazy storm hitting you and changing all the ions in your body, and suddenly, you can play with electrical currents, and therefore, control what's around you... on a molecular level. Huh? [exhales] Okay, so... When you make an apple float, you're not picking up the apple, you're moving billions of ions. - I don't pick up apples. - Cheez Doodles, whatever. You're moving ions. But the engine, at least for you, seems to be in here. So the more control you have over your feelings, the more control you'll have over your powers. I saw a video of a guy who could hold his breath for nine minutes, and he got free pizza for life. Well, we gotta get in on that. - How long can you go for? I'll time you. - [both inhale] [birds chirping] [keys jangling] [exhales] [hip hop playing] [knocking] Hey! Is... Is the music too loud? Uh, well, the walls are moving. Ey. Uh, do you have a second? I'm promoting this guy next week. This guy's got about 100,000 followers on Twitter. So, your mother tells me you're quite the entrepreneur. That's the word she used? Entrepreneur. I need a favor. A favor? Uh, it's more like a job. I would pay you. Um, I... I need you to find the person who posted this. That's a screenshot. Um, do you need the URL? Nah, I got a buddy, he could do this. He can find anything. - How fast? - Uh, how much are you paying? Right. What is this? That's $20. [Malik scoffs] Oh, uh... now... it is $30. [Malik] Oh, my God. Uh, see, let's... Let... Let's break these numbers down, all right. We... - You can't dance. - Excuse me? I'm just telling you to your face that you can't dance. But, you know, not all hope is lost. - I'm here. - [Malik] Is that right? I'm trying to tell you I will give you dance lessons. My friends, they charge $150 an hour, so... I'll give you three dance lessons. That's a $450 value. [stammers] Why do I need a choreographer? How are you gonna throw a dance party, but you can't dance? I mean, that's embarrassing. Do you want to be embarrassed? No. No. So we got a deal? [woman] BIONA is working to understand, predict, and reverse these world-threatening events. We are BIONA Initiative. Creating climate solutions for a better world. All right. Ready to go on the tour? It's kind of strange being here without your dad, isn't it? - You know, we don't have to stay. - I want to stay. The fish! Dad had a whole bag of fish food in his office. He always let me feed the fish. That's right. I remember that. Something wrong? Where's Greeny? Hmm. I don't know. Uh, what does Greeny look like? He's green. Right, because he's Greeny. That's a good name. Uh... Well, you know what? I heard a rumor in the break room that Greeny wanted to go back into the ocean, so, um... that's exactly where Greeny is. He's, uh... he's in the... the ocean. Greeny's dead, isn't he? [Pat sighs] Yeah, I'm... I'm pretty sure Greeny's dead. I'm sorry, bud. - Um, you all right? - Yeah, he did have a good life. [Pat] Yeah, exactly. He had a great life. What's down there? [Pat] Oh, down there... is L5, which is one of the labs. Can I see it? - [Pat] Ah, sorry, pal. Don't have access. - Why not? That is a very good question. Um... Maybe because people don't appreciate me, or because they don't want to see how awesome I am. [inhales] Hey, you know what? If you come with me, I'll show you something way cooler than a dumb lab. Let's go. Come on. [machines beeping] - Wow. - [Pat chuckles] This is a lot of TVs. So, this is where BIONA keeps track of all the crazy weather around the world. [Pat chuckles] - Yep. - A tornado in the ocean? Yeah, that's a waterspout over the... Indian Ocean. - This is so cool. - [chuckles] You like it? Because guess what? I designed it. You made the TVs? No, it... No. Not the TVs. These are live feeds triggered by weather conditions. So, things get crazy, we start watching. So, look, torrential rains are about to hit Shanghai. - The red part? - Yep, that's the red part. But in Tasmania, they're suffering from a drought. Maybe those people can send some of their water to those people. - BIONA is already working on that. - Wow. - Yeah, it's... - [Suzanne] What's going on? - This is my office, Pat. - Sorry, um... No, I know. [stammers] I just wanted... I... I knew you'd want to see Mark Warren's son. This is Dion. Uh, Dion, this is my boss, Ms. Wu. You're Dion? I haven't seen you since you were little. I'm Suzanne. I worked with your father. - You were in the big video. - Mm-hmm. - Are you a scientist? - I am. And your dad was one of our best. Now, how old are you? Almost eight. How old are you? - Older than that. - Twenty-five? Let's say yes. [all laugh] - We miss your dad around here. - We miss him at home, too. I have a little free time. I'd love to show you around. - If that's okay with Pat? - Hey, lead the way. Come on. - [Dion] I like your shoes. - Thanks. I like your backpack. - [Dion] I like outer space. - [Suzanne] Yeah, me too. [telephone rings] [woman] J.O.B. Temporary Employment Agency. How may I direct your call? Good morning. Uh, I have an interview today. - Uh, my name is... - Have a seat. Fill out the application. You need to take a typing test. [woman 1] We need someone proficient in Word, PowerPoint... [woman 2] Can we call your last employer for a reference? - [man 1] Are you willing to relocate? - [woman 3] Sorry. You're overqualified. [man 2] We need someone with more experience. [line trilling] Hey, Willa, um... Could you still talk to Kwame... for me? Yeah, uh, I... I could do today. [sentimental instrumental music plays] We should probably go, bud. [Suzanne] You feel like ice cream? I do. Our chef makes the best mint chocolate chip ice cream in the entire world. How about we go treat ourselves? Come on. [cell phone rings to Stranger Things theme] Ooh, uh, I... I'll meet you guys down there. Hey, how's the job search? Five interviews. Still jobless. I'm sorry. Where are you now? The dance studio. Oh, are... are you dancing? No. I'm standing... outside. My friend Willa set me up to talk to the company manager about a job. That's... That's good. Right? Isn't it? [stammers] I soloed for this company. You know, how am I supposed to come back with my hand out? [Pat] Just go in. Mmm... I'm not ready yet. How are things there? Good. Uh... Have I ever told you that my boss hates me? - Yes. - [Pat] Oh yeah? I have? Yeah. Well, um, she still hates my guts, um, but she... she loves Dion, though. - How is he? - He's good. He, um... Well, he wants to change his Reptile Repo username, because Esmeralda... Esperanza. [Pat] Esperanza won't stop texting him. Okay, Nicole. It's... It is time for you to go in, and I'm not very good at pep talks, but you gotta just walk into the interview like you own the place, like... Like Beyoncé. - Beyoncé? - [Pat clears throat] Yeah. Yeah. Exactly like Beyoncé, and you got the wind machines going, and... and your... your hair's, like, all whipping around, and, uh, you're just standing there all tough, and you're like, "Yeah, I can type 50 words a minute. What?" And then they're like, "Cool! You're hired, with dental." And you're like, "I don't even need dental. I got perfect teeth." And they're like, "We're giving it to you anyway." And then you just do a catwalk strut out of the room. [laughs] That was so very specific. [laughs] [exhales] Hey, um, you're wrong. You... You give a great pep talk. Thank you. Anytime. [chuckles] [Nicole] Bye. [disconnects call] [inhales] [inhales] Yoncé. [exhales] [woman] And one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Stand, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Right, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Extend, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. [sentimental instrumental music plays] How's your barrel turn? Uh... I don't know. It's been a second. I'd go from plié to a barrel turn and my arms were everywhere, but you were perfect every time. I'd just watch you and be mad. [Nicole laughs] You know, I've been a student, and I've been a teacher's assistant, so... I'm the perfect fit. And even though teaching was never really the goal, I... I think being close to the school and... and dance, it... it... it would be okay. Not "okay." That's a bad word choice. Great. It would be great. - It is the goal. - Nicole. And before you say whatever it is you're about to say, I just want to be really real with you, okay? You're like my fifth... No, you're my sixth interview today, and, um, not to sway you in any way, but a "no" would really crush my soul. You're here for a teaching position? Willa just said you were looking for work. There aren't any openings, and even if there were, you should see the people we get applying here. Okay. Yeah. I'm sorry I wasted your time. Miss Barrel Turn. Where are you going? You said there were no jobs. I said there were no teaching jobs. I am, however, in charge of the front office, and I have a position available in ticket sales. It's entry level. Hourly's pretty great. And after that, you get healthcare. Dion has asthma. I really need healthcare. Then work your butt off and get promoted. - So you're giving me a job? - I'm giving you a job. [mid-tempo dance music plays] [man] Dig into it, Daniel. More power. Watch your lines. Hold up. Nicole Warren - is back in the building. - Ah! [laughs] - Oh, my God. - Amazing. Celine. - Yes! - [Celine laughs] - [Nicole laughs] - [squeals] - Hey, hello. - Oh, my God. - You're amazing. - Thanks, girl. So, how did it go with Kwame? You are looking at the new box office sales - marketing... something. - Yes! - [both laugh] - You're home. [chuckles] That's all that matters. Thank you. I'll talk to you later? Thank you. Girl, I got you. Anytime you need studio time to chop it up, just say the word. Oh, no, I ain't got it like that no more. I bet if I asked you to perform Take Me To The Water, you'd slay it. Uh, the woman who performed that piece had a baby and dropped her gym membership. - Yeah. - Yeah. - [laughs] - [phone chimes] Uh, I gotta go. It was good seeing you. Welcome back. [Brayden grunts] [grunting] [grunts] [grunts] [rooster crows] Dad? [grunts] Yeah. Who do we have here? [Brayden] That van was here last night, too. Come on, let's go. Turn around and close your eyes. You're parked on private property. I've got a loaded shotgun, zero patience, and I don't miss often. I'm not gonna count to three. I'm just gonna start to shoot. - [rock music plays] - Chill. Chill with the gun, okay? - We're leaving. - We're going. - Let's go. - All right, all right. - Come on. - I'm trying. - That's not... No. - [tires squeal] You should have shot them. Or used your powers. Don't you ever let me hear you talk like that again. That is not who we are. I just wanted them scared. You understand me? - Do you? - Yes, sir. Come on. Love you, bud. All right, Dion. You wanna throw it away? - You already finished your ice cream? - It was only two scoops. What? - [laughs] - [Pat] Wow. [chuckles] [Suzanne] Uh, and now I'm afraid it's time for me to get back to work. Oh, yeah. Sure. Load him up with sugar and then hand him off to me. [chuckles] [stammers] I'm... kidding. I... Sugar's great... for kids. Aspartame is the bad one. Well, I hope to see you again very soon, Dion. Thank you, Mrs. Suzanne. [Suzanne] Are you coming, Lars? [door beeps open] I want ice cream. [animal lowing] I just saw a reindeer. A reindeer? In Atlanta? [reindeer grunting] It sounds scared. We have to get inside. Oh... Or, uh, here's an idea. I could keep my job. Because the checks are nice, and I get a discount at Costco. [reindeer grunts] [reindeer grunts] Okay, so... Hey, hey, hey, hey! Dion, no, no, no, no. Hey, no, no, no. Do... Do not take off the watch. - I have to. - Why? Because you won't let me in and he's in pain. What are you doing? Hey! Don't! Aah! There's, like, five levels of steel in there. Are you okay? - Yeah. - Look. Dion, listen to me. This is not part of the tour. My card doesn't even work here. Suzanne has to give me permission. What are you looking at? Dion? If we got busted, it would be my job. All right? Do you understand? - [grunting] - Okay? Look at me. Hey. Hey, hey, hey. [grunting] Rein it in. [Dion grunts] Oh, God. [cell phone beeping] [people chattering] Remember we talked about, uh, feelings and emotions? So you gotta... you gotta stay in control, Dion, okay? Let's... let's... let's... let's focus. [Dion grunting] [grunts] Is that my boss's keycard under my shoe? I tried to do what you told me and focus, but... [inhales] I just... I couldn't stop thinking about the animals in there. [Pat exhales] I get it. Uh... Oh. I could... I'm gonna lose my job. Only if we get caught. Two minutes, and then we are out. Yes! Yes. - [door beeping] - Nothing. Whoa. [horse neighs] [laughs] Oh, cool. What is this place? [reindeer grunts] See? There's the reindeer. [beeping steadily] [inhales] They're studying people. - [reindeer grunts] - Pat. Yeah. Where'd they all come from? [Pat exhales] They are all from Iceland. [sheep bleats] What is that? [Pat] What? Oh. - Let's stand a little away. - What are they doing to it? [gasps] Don't touch that. I don't know what they're doing. [animal grunts] [Dion] They're experimenting on them. We have to save them. [bleats] [exhales] All of them. Okay, one minute, and then we're out, all right? Okay? Okay. [animal grunts] [animal whimpering] [animal whimpering] Pat. What's wrong with him? He's sick, buddy. - [whimpers] - He's... He's very sick. [horse neighs] Pl... Please feel better. Please. [exhales] Please. [Dion panting] [gasps] [exhales] [howls] [howls] Congratulations. You are the first to crack my Illuminati code and discover my identity. I've been hit with multiple man-in-the-middle and WAP attacks, but they still couldn't crack me. - Tell me, how'd you do it? - I traded a kid for three dance lessons. Fracking awesome. [chuckles] So, what can you tell me about this lightning storm video that you posted? Here's my theory, and it is just a theory. Uh, I think the people inside the storm were abducted by some malevolent force, unable to break free. Uh, but you see this one over here, away from the others? That burst of light? Something or someone is trying to break free. [Nicole stammers] And the mass in the center of the storm? Lightning guy? Yeah. It's David Bowie. - David Bowie is the mass in the storm? - Yeah. - And... - Did you just say that? Okay. And that's just the beginning. A woman in Kansas City sent me a photo of Prince on a double blueberry pancake. They're all coming back. - I... I don't know why just yet, but... - Yeah. This... This was a mistake. [Wendy] It's not just Atlanta. I have videos of lightning guy from Tuscany, Cuba, Guatemala, Malawi, Iceland. Just like this? Same. He travels the globe. Hey, little buddy. Got a name? Mine's Dion. [eerie humming] [Dion[ Wow. [animal bleating] [animal bleating] [alarm sounds] We gotta wrap this up. I did something stupid. [computerized voice] Checking north entrance of L5. [Pat] Oh, okay, we've got to find another way out. - Uh... Oh, this was so dumb. - [grunting] This was so dumb. Why did I listen to you? [grunting loudly] [system powers down] [animal groaning] - BIONA power supply is currently down. - Hey, hey. - Please exit the building... - Where are you? Dion! Hey. - [beeps] - [door opens] [male computerized voice] Checking south entrance of L5. [female computerized voice] BIONA power supply is currently down. Please exit the building in an orderly fashion. - [man] Habitat C emergency generator on. - [Pat whispers] Hey, Dion. Come here. Come on. - What are you doing? Go. Go, go, go, go. - [woman] Habitat D emergency generator on. [male computerized voice] Habitat E emergency generator on. Hey, hey, hey, hey! Stop, stop. Okay. Come here. Okay, okay. You're fine? [panting] What's in your pocket? Uh, what? Dion, what is in your pocket? Did you steal something out of the lab? Are you serious? - It was lonely. - [sighs] That was not yours to take, buddy. It wasn't theirs either. It had a family and a home. And they just took it anyway and put it in a cage! - Okay. - BIONA power supply is currently down. You knocked the power out. On purpose. I was afraid you'd get in trouble and I didn't want them to see me. Wow. [exhales] We're going home. Let's move, okay? - Are you gonna tell my mom? - No. Because you're gonna tell her. - What? - That's right. - [Dion] That's not how it works. - That is exactly how it works. [Dion] No, it's not. [man] This way. Move it. [Pat] Uh-oh. Hey. Okay, be cool, all right? Come on. - BIONA power supply is currently down. - Okay. - Please exit the building in an orderly... - [guard] Badge? Okay. - Name? - Pat Rollins. Uh, I work here. - And this is, uh, my guest. - Badge? Oh, yeah. - Dion Warren. - Mm-hmm. [crunching] Ow! Got a problem there, son? Uh, no, my... His feet hurt. I've been dragging him around all day. - [chuckles nervously] - BIONA power supply is currently down. Please exit the building... Careful as you exit. Lights are out in the parking lot. Thank you very much. [Pat exhales] Oh! - Oh... - [siren wailing in distance] Hey, um, maybe we don't tell your mother this part. - Okay. - Okay. [Pat sighs] [siren wails] [horns honking] [hip hop music plays] Hey. Alrighty. [Nicole] You did good. I found the person I was looking for. You see? I told you. See, I know my people. [chuckles] Now, let's see how you do getting me dance proficient in four days. - Four days? - Yeah. Right, um... Let me see it again. All right. It goes a little bit like... - Oh. - Okay. - Oh. - Yeah. Oh. Ah. Ah. Bring it back. Ah. [Nicole] Oh. Oh. Bless you. Oh, no. Okay, okay, okay. You know what? None of that. Rest up, because it's gonna be a rough couple days. That's... No, just... No. No one wants to pay money to see that. What? She's tripping, bro. It's still hot, right? My mom's renting a huge bouncy house, and maybe even a climbing wall. Is Arlo and Daniel coming? Yeah. We just got our red belts. We're like the three musketeers of karate. My friends are skaters. We do cool tricks at the skate park. Cool! Can you show me how? They're better than I am, so... [boy] Then they can show me how at the party. - Uh, gotta go. - Bye, Andre. - Bye, Andre. - Bye, Andre. Did you invite everyone in my class? Even Jonathan and Chris? I sure did. You gotta make sure that you get the cake I like. Oh, hey, I got you. [Pat chuckles] Please go brush your teeth. Wee! So, uh... - How'd it go? - I got a job. Oh! That is great. I also found that woman who posted that video, and she says that these storms are happening all over the world. BIONA studies weather. I mean, maybe we should take this to them? Um, uh, well, they... they... Actually, they already know. So today, I... I found out that BIONA is tracking people who were up in Iceland during the aurora. They've got names and addresses. I... I wrote down the names I could remember, but some of them had umlauts, and so... you know. Suzanne was adamant that I not see what was in that lab, even though I was in Iceland, so I could help. Wow. Hey, I'm sorry I dragged you into this. No, no, no, no. It's... it's fine. - Mom. - Hm? There's this app I like, and I need your credit card. - Uh, no. - [Pat chuckles] - Please. - Uh, no. And you know what? You've had enough of this for today, and tomorrow we're setting ground rules. - But you had fun today? - Yeah. Can you tell me one exciting thing that happened today? Uh... - What? - Greeny died. Oh, man. But I met a hermit crab. Ooh, a hermit crab. He was all alone in a cage, I didn't want anything bad to happen to him. And? - [inhales] - Dion, what did you do with the crab? - Can we keep it? - Ugh. - No. You stole it. - [Dion whines] Well, technically, he... - set it free. - [Nicole] And you knew about this? You know what? Doesn't matter. It's going back tomorrow. Can I say goodbye? No, you don't have to, because crabs don't speak English. [sighs] Dear Pinchy... That's his name. Here we go. I'm sorry that I couldn't keep you in my bedroom, where I would give you lots of toys and lots of food. But my mom says I have to send you back where you have no friends and where you'll probably die. - Just like Greeny. - This is a master class. - It's wrong. - Is it? I mean, Dion saved a crab today. - Stay in your lane. - Okay. Just one last thing, because I'm just... I'm just thinking out loud for a second. Um, keeping the crab might be easier than bringing it back and having to explain how a seven-year-old child snuck into a top secret laboratory. And plus, they will fire me. Like, for sure.
