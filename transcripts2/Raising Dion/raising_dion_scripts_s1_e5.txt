 Now this is some prime yurt action. - [Pat chuckles] - Whoo! Yeah. Right? Nothing but the best for Mark Warren. - [Mark exhales] - [Pat chuckles] - Try not to, uh, kick snow on my rug. - Ah, okay, I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - [chuckles] Hey, man. Can you squeeze any more equipment in here? I think you're defeating the purpose of having a see-through yurt. - I've seen it before. - [chuckles] I sent up a ceiling balloon yesterday to get a baseline.

 And the pyranometer? Uh, yeah, there's a... there's a clearing. You'll see. I set it dead center. - Oh, man. I can't wait to get out there. - [laughs] Well, do you want to rest first, or... No, no, no, I'm fine. - I mean, I feel great. I want to get... - [knocking] Come outside. I'm working, but, uh, I'll see you tonight. [Mark] New girl? Kerry. I met her the second night I was here. - Okay. - She lives in Montana. - Ah. - But get this. - Her friend Jill... - Okay. ...who, uh, kind of hates me, by the way. Uh, she has a house on the lake near your cabin,

 and they're going there right after the aurora. So... So you want to borrow the cabin and ruin the rest of Jill's vacation? Yes, that's correct. That's what I want. [laughs] It's an excellent plan. All right, do it. I mean, uh, you know... - Ah, that's cool with you? - [Mark] Of course. Unless you want me to be alone for the rest of my life? No, I mean, uh... - I don't plan to be. - [Pat chuckles] Yeah, when's the last time you... Oh. What? No. We didn't think about it. We just did it. Um... [exhales] Wow! That... um... Congrats. [stammers] I mean... You've only known her, like, a couple months, right? Pat, this is it. She's the one. Are you sure? Because she's nothing like any of the other girls - you've ever dated. - I know, right? Okay, that sounds like I'm saying it's a good thing. Um, I, uh... I th... [sucks in air] Isn't she kind of... Inspired, fearless, smart, beautiful? And I was gonna add to that, uh, a handful? And that's what I love about her. Oh, no, you don't. - Yes, I do. - [chortling] No, you don't. - I do. - Okay, I'm sorry. The guy who, uh, folds his socks and T-shirts into neat little squares. - That has nothing to do with it. - No, that is a guy who plans. That guy doesn't just run off and marry some flaky dancer he barely knows. Unless he does, and that is... Then it's... You know, then it's great. Uh... And I'm sure it'll be great. Um... Pat. You okay? [Pat] Yeah, um... Ah, just... It took me by surprise, but it's... it's all good. I mean... - All right, give me some love, man. - Yes, sorry, that's what I meant to do. - Congratulations. - Oh, man. Appreciate it. If you're happy, I'm happy. And you were my best man in my head. You were there. - Okay. - Okay? - [chuckles] All right. - Let's get out there and see some lights. - Uh, I will be in here. - You're gonna stay inside the yurt? Yeah, uh, I'm a lot more interested in the numbers and not getting pneumonia, so just, uh, do a little sound check while you're out there. - All right. - In the freezing cold. Copy that. [chuckles] [Mark] All right, sound check. [Pat inhales sharply] Bubble Boy, last chance. I... I'm sorry. [stammers] I can't hear you. I'm... I'm too warm and comfortable in here. [Mark] All right, whatever. [people chattering] All right, Pat. Talk to me. What kind of radiation are we seeing up here? [Pat] Um, elevated, but not unusual. Uh, sonar's picking up an increased rate of atmospheric turbulence. Well, I did just make an entrance. [Pat laughs] Government spying on us up here? Oh, no, nothing like that. We're just recording atmospheric conditions before and after the comet passes. - Are you a scientist or an adventurer? - Farmer. I've always wanted to see the northern lights. Seems like this is the one to see. Yeah, well, they say when the one comes along, you don't want to miss it. Can't wait. Yeah, me either. - See you, man. - See you. [cell phone beeps] Hey, baby, it's me. Um... It's crazy up here. I mean, it's so beautiful. I wish you could see it. [sniffs] Anyway, we got a lot of work to do, but I can't stop thinking about when I'm getting home to you, because I miss that. [Pat] Tell me you're not still talking to the farmer. Are you eavesdropping on my conversation? [Kerry] Oh, that's Pat's friend. - Hi. - Hi. Uh, your girl just waved at me. For once that doesn't threaten me, married man. [man 1] Look at that. Wow. [man 2] Oh, man... Oh, man. [Mark] Pat? Pat, get your lame ass up here because it's happening. [computer beeping] Hey, uh... Are you experiencing a fluctuation in temperature out there? Yeah, I can feel your girl getting cold because you're hiding out in a heated yurt. No, Mark, there's... there's something... uh... [woman] Whoa. [computer beeps] Wow. [laughs] - [computer beeping] - Mark? What's going on out there? Mark? [staticky] Are you okay? The radiation level's off the charts. Mark! ...hear me? What's going on? Mark! [exhales] [laughs] This is amazing. Baby, where are you? [Pat] Mark? Mark? [voices whispering indistinctly] Hey, baby. Listen, we just got here and it is amazing. I mean, it's so beautiful out here. I wish you were here with me. [inhales] Okay, so we got a lot of work to do, but I can't stop thinking about when I'm getting home to you, because I miss that. [Pat] Tell me you're not still talking to the farmer. [Mark] Are you eavesdropping on my conversation? [cabinet opens] - Mom! - Breakfast before Cheez Doodles. Those are for Pinchy. Really? Is that what's in the shaker, Pinchy? Cheez Doodles? Pinchy and I are gonna give you one chance to take back that lie, - otherwise, we're grounding you. - My party's today! - Five, four... - I'm trying to finish my homework. ...three, two... I'm sorry! I'm sorry, Pinchy. You didn't deserve that. Come on, I'll make you breakfast. Did you tell everybody to bring their skateboards to the party? Uh... Well, Chris and Steffi aren't gonna make it, buddy. Or Jonathan. What? They, um... they have stuff that they do on Saturdays, you know? And, uh, since when are you guys friends? I told Andre they were coming! You have to call them back! Yeah, well, they're not gonna make it, but you know who is coming? Esperanza's coming. Oh, why? Because she's your friend. She's not my friend. She's a girl. Steffi's a girl. Hm? Hey, I got you your favorite cake. [squeals] - Chocolate fudge volcano from Benny's? - Yes, yes! - I'm picking it up on the way there. - Okay. Yes! We're gonna have the best time today. You're gonna get to see all your old friends. It's gonna be great. Hey. Next time, levitate a banana. [cell phone rings to Stanger Things theme] If you're trying to return a magical crab, I cannot help you. Are you coming to Dion's birthday party? Because nobody else is. Kat is on call, and my mom has a bad back and can't travel, so my father won't travel without her. Mark's parents are in Germany, so... Everyone is sending gifts, but no one's actually coming. I will be there. Okay, it's at 3:00 p.m. at Tasha Patel's house. I have the invitation. I'm also on Tasha's side of town. - Do you need me to bring anything? - No, she has everything taken care of. She wasn't even actually planning on having a party with us. Dion's had so many changes, I just wanted something to stay the same. Yeah, totally. That sounds, uh, good. Um... I... gotta go, but, uh, I'll see you at the party. Okay. [inhales deeply] [cell phone rings] - I thought you said you had to go. - Are you throwing up? - No, why? - Then get in here. Season tickets go on sale today, and I am alone. - Stomach bug got half the staff. - Okay, um... Well, I can't today because it's my son's birthday party. Don't give me drama. I need you, and you need this job, right? Yeah, well, can't someone else do it? Yes, and I'm calling them, too, but you're the first one to pick up. People are getting fired today, let me tell you that. Okay, um... You know, the party is at 3:00, so if I leave by no later than 2:00, then... Why are you doing math? Get here. [sighs] [line trilling] [line trilling] This is Pat. Leave a message. [sighs] [knocking] - Hi, Tessa. How's it going? - Fine. I know this is really out of the blue, um, but what are you doing today? Because I just got called into work and it's my son's birthday party. You want me to throw him a birthday party? I was hoping that you could drive him. It's at 3:00, in Ansley Park. - I gotta get dressed up? - It's a kids' party. - In Ansley Park. - You can wear whatever you want. And I will be done at work by 2:00, I will pick up the cake, and meet you there. - All right. - Really? 'Cause you barely know me. Girl, I know you. I got you. Thank you. Praise Jesus. [chuckles] [Pat clears throat] Do you have any idea why the power went out? Hmm. Um... No, no. [stammers] Uh, Dion and I were just talking about... [chuckles] you know... where we wanted to go for lunch, and then, um... suddenly, boom, we were in total darkness. - Where'd you go? - For lunch? [chuckles] During the blackout. When the lights came back on, you were gone. [Pat] Yes. We, uh... [stammers] We just left. It was pitch black in there, and, uh, you had already given Dion the royal tour, so... we just, uh... we made our way to the front and the... the, uh, guards let us out. [inhales] - L5 was vandalized. - What? Not long after you were standing outside that door. Did you see anything unusual while you were there? Not a thing. I mean, I could check with Dion. Because I'm gonna see him, uh, actually... Oh, uh, right now. [chuckles] So, yeah. He's having a... a birthday party thing with Tasha Patel's kid. Ah, I didn't realize that was for Dion, too. Mm-hmm. You up on all the kid's parties? [chuckles] - Not much gets past me. - [Pat chuckles] Yeah. Well, um... I should probably get on the road, but, um, I'll let you know if... if Dion remembers anything, you know, weird from... from yesterday. - That'd be great. - Uh, yeah. Yep. [knocking] Thank you so much for doing this. Um, so, Dion is in his room, and he's really mad at me for going to work on his birthday. Also, there's a girl from his class that's gonna be riding with you. Her name is Esperanza, and her dad will be dropping her off. - Do not let him be mean to her, okay? - Okay. - Thank you. - [cell phone rings] - Yes, Kwame, I'm on my way. - [Kwame] Let's go, go, go. Go, go, go. [applause] [piano plays] [deep breaths] [cheering and applause] Yeah, baby! You... are... You are amazing. Like, I mean, seriously, like, so damn attractive. [Mark chuckles] Have you been working on your legs? Because you... you... you got up there. [laughs] Yeah, I caught some air. Mm-hmm. I'm impressed. [Nicole laughs] No, but seriously, baby, you were... you were fantastic. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah, it's a good one to quit on. Come on. What are you saying? You don't quit. Not forever, but... What's wrong? What's going on? Um... I'm... I'm pregnant. You're... Hm. [ragged breath] Uh, you sure? Okay. [coughs] [both laughing] [Mark grunts] That's it, you're just happy? You're not afraid or... Afraid of what? You're not happy? I'm... very happy. [laughs] Then we got this. - Yeah. - We got this. [laughs] I mean, I can take a year off, and the company would have me back, and then, I... I could figure out childcare, and... Hey, I'm hearing a lot of I's. We just got married, and I just don't want to take you off track from work. All right, look. I don't want to lose track of my kid's life. My father wasn't around a lot when I was growing up. He was always on deployment, and you know that. Birthdays, football games. It was like he was never really there. Yeah, but that's not going to be me. I'll come off the road and focus more on research. But if you'll allow it, we're gonna have this baby. You and me. And we're gonna do this together. Okay, I'm gonna hold you to it. - Okay. - [Nicole laughs] [Mark] Mmm. Thanks for reminding me how alone I am. [Mark and Nicole laugh] - This needs to go to group sales. - Okay. - Thomas is coming in to relieve you. - [phones ring] - Kwame, thank you so much. - He'll be in at 2:30. - Oh, uh, I really need to leave at 2:00. - You know what I really need? Never mind. [Kwame scoffs] [phones continue ringing] [cell phone chimes] [Nicole laughs] [clock ticking] Hey, Tessa, it's Nicole. Look, I'm really glad I caught you, because Esperanza's dad just texted me that he thinks it would be easier with her wheelchair if you drove his van. Is that okay? Okay, good, 'cause he's on his way now. Um... [laughs] Of course. Okay, see you. Bye. I know that was not a personal call. [phones ringing] It's 2:30 and Thomas isn't here yet. Welcome to my world. [phone rings] The Lewis Company. [hip hop plays] Andre! Dion! Here's your present! Eh. Let's go. The party's in the backyard. - Hey, hey, don't just run off. - Can I go with them? Please. - Okay, go on. Might take me a minute. - You guys go. I'll meet you back there. I found out about these cheat codes on a gaming site that tells you how to stockpile diamonds. - Oh, you're talking about Reptile Repo? - Yeah. [Andre] We don't play that anymore. Why not? Because it's stupid. Big dumb dinosaur eating diamonds. I know, right? That's why I stopped playing it, too. [makes munching sounds] - Hey. - What are you guys talking about? - Reptile Repo. - Dion loves Reptile Repo. He got this idea. He found these cheat codes online so he can stockpile diamonds. [all laugh] Don't listen to her. She doesn't know what she's talking about. Whatever, let's just go to the obstacle course. - Yeah, let's do it! - [all] Yeah! Don't embarrass me, please. Uh, what's up with her? She's in my class. My mom made me bring her. Oh, I get it now. Hi, can I help you? Is this your house? Yes. It's a nice one. I'm Tessa. I drove Dion. Are you his nanny? I'm his neighbor, and his mother's friend. Oh. - Where's Nicole? - She's at work. Well, I hope she hurries. We're cutting the cake at 5:20. You can wait for her, right? There's plenty more food inside. Please enjoy. Am I his nanny? [grunts] [clock ticking] Ma'am, I suggest that you just call back once you've made up your mind. We're here until 9:00. I'm missing my son's birthday party because of you, Thomas! No. Oh, come on. [knocking] Hello? [knocking] Hi, hi, hi. I need to get a birthday cake. - We're closed. - My son's birthday cake. Please. I'll pay you extra. It's the, uh, chocolate fudge volcano with the dinosaur on it. Hey! Please. Come on. Come on, the only reason I'm late was because Thomas was late 'cause he's a selfish prick, and I paid a lot of money for that cake, okay? Decorated for my son... Thank you. - [coughs] - [bells chime] Sorry. Sorry. Ah... Hey, thank you, okay? You're welcome. No, no, no, no. No. [engine turns over] - ["3005" plays] - ♪ No matter what you say or what you do ♪ ♪ When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you ♪ ♪ Forget these others I'll be right by your side ♪ ♪ Till 3005 ♪ - ♪ Hold up ♪ - ♪ Hold up ♪ - ♪ Hold up ♪ - ♪ Hold up ♪ ♪ Hold up ♪ ♪ Hold up ♪ Come on, bug. ♪ When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you ♪ ♪ Forget these others I'll be right by your side ♪ ♪ Till 3005 ♪ - ♪ Hold up ♪ - ♪ Hold up ♪ [whoosh] Come on.

I'm working on something incredibly important right now. Dion's birthday is incredibly important. - No, but this. I have... - What? This isn't just work. You're out of the house all hours, and you don't come home until we're already asleep. - I'm just worried. - [Mark] Well, don't be. - I just have to handle this. - [Nicole] Handle what? I'll tell you when I can, Nicole. [Nicole] Okay, that is your father right there. "Handle my own" nonsense. I thought we were gonna do things differently. - [Mark] We are doing things differently. - Okay. Baby, talk to me, I mean... What is so important that you're gonna miss your son's birthday party? You know what that feels like. Why would you do that to him? - Why don't you want to be here with us? - [Mark] I do. I want to be there more than anything in the world. I want... [upbeat dance song plays] Come on, dance with us, son. Come on, baby. This is amazing. - Isn't it beautiful? - Mm-hmm. - All for your baby. - [Dion] Daddy! [giggles] - Look! - Hey. What's up, bug? Hey, happy birthday. [Dion laughs] [Mark] Little bug. [Dion] Mommy! Hey. - Hey, why'd do you do that? - Sorry. - Mmm. That wasn't funny. - I know. [Dion and Nicole laugh] Hey. What's up? Ah. Ahh! Yes. You ready for some cake? Hi. [laughs] Hi! Hi, sweetie. Tessa, hey. I'm so glad you're here. That Tasha's hell-bent on cutting the cake exactly at... [both] 5:20. This is not my first rodeo. Thank you. [Pat] What? Oh, you've got a little... [Tessa] You a little jealous? Somebody might be taking your man away from you? Stop it. - [Pat] Okay. - [both laugh] [Nicole] Can you go get Tasha? - Yeah. - Thank you. Um... [Tasha] Cake time! [children cheer] Hey! Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah! - Mom! - Hey! [giggles] Happy birthday, sweetie. Look, Dion has a Reptile Repo cake. [laughter] You said you hated Reptile Repo. - I do. - Wait, isn't this what you asked me for? - No. - Now he's lying. [laughs] Hey, that's my best friend you're talking about. He said he only brought you 'cause his mom made him. - Dion. - Andre. Well, you did. His real friends are skateboarders, but they're not here. Wait. Why aren't they here? You don't really think Chris and Jonathan are your friends, do you? Stop telling people you're my best friend. You're not. I don't have a best friend. In fact, I don't have any friends! Hey. Hey, excuse me, young man. Stop. You don't talk to people like that. Go back and apologize to her. Who wants cake? - Me. - [Nicole] What is the matter? [Dion] This is all your fault. Why'd you make us move? Now I don't fit in anywhere! I got this, Ms. W. Why'd you say those things? [Dion] Why'd you have to open your big mouth?! Why can't you keep a secret?! I can keep a secret, but I won't lie. [grunts, wheezes] Get out of here. - [Dion panting] - Nope. [panting] Leave me alone! [wheezing] - Are you okay? - I need my inhaler. - Where is it? - Backpack! I got you. Move, move! Out of my way! Out of my way! Get out of my way! [gasps] Di. [inhales] Oh, that ain't good. [gasps] - Are you okay? - Yeah, but... I'm sorry. Hey, it's okay. It's okay, don't worry. Come on. Get out. Out, out, out. Dion made his inhaler fly across the yard. I saw it. Esperanza saw it. I don't know who else saw it. - Come on, baby. - [Pat] Oh. Okay. All right, come on, buddy. [children laughing] Just say it. I can do things. I know. What do you mean, you know? You have powers. I've always known that. - You knew? - Yes. But how? I pay attention to people. Why didn't you tell me? - Superheroes are supposed to stay secret. - You think you're a superhero? Can you fly? Uh, no, I don't think so. Hmm. Why didn't you say anything? I figured you would tell me when you wanted to, or not. Does anyone else know? You knocked Jonathan down without touching him, and he didn't figure it out, so I think you're safe. Thank you. [Esperanza] Told you I could keep a secret. Huh. [engine turns over] Um... Just take my car and I'll take the kids home. Sounds good. I gotta go to the grocery store. - You saved my life today. - [chuckles] You'll save mine tomorrow. [Tessa] Bye, kids. - Bye, Miss Tessa. - Bye. [Pat] Okay, I got a chocolate cake, a couple of forks, and I am walking away. Did you notice how Suzanne was watching Dion? Okay, don't look, but she's watching us. That's creepy. Um... Do you want to talk later? Because I could... I could come hang out. We can make some dinner, Dion can open his gifts and... Thank you, but, you know, it's... it's been a day. [Pat] That it has. [van beeping] [Pat clears throat] Why don't you see if Lita's free? Oh, uh, we're... we're... we're just, uh... we're friends. Uh, see? [inhales, exhales] Uh, thank you again for showing up today. It meant a lot to Dion. Oh, yeah. And me too. Well, uh, careful going home, and, uh... - Yeah. - [Nicole] Thank you. If you need... Yeah. ["3005" plays on radio] [Mark] We're gonna have this baby. You and me. And we're gonna do this together. [Dion laughs] This is so good. ♪ I want to feed you, Danger Dino ♪ ♪ Those diamonds are mine ♪ [laughs] [Dion and Esperanza laugh] Mmm. [laughs] [Mark] I gotta get back to my family. We're on vacation, and I left them up at the lake house. [Charlotte] They must be confused about all of this. They don't know. I don't want them worried about me. This is for me to figure out. So, when did you first realize you had abilities? Uh, about four years after going up to Iceland. - Yeah, me too. - Yeah, that's how I knew you were legit. - Hmm. - I got a lot of... A bunch of weirdos messaged me after I went in that chat room, but I was so curious to see if anyone else was having these symptoms. What made you track it back to the Iceland event? - I lead a very quiet life. - Hmm. Uh, some might say boring. My ex-husband said that. So, when he left me, I... I decided to go to Iceland... to be more interesting. Hmm. I didn't realize the sky was going to explode. - You mean the solar flare. - Yeah, whatever. It was the most interesting thing that's ever happened to me in my life. Until this. Charlotte, where'd you go? Nowhere. I just go invisible. It's like hiding behind a curtain. - [stammers] How'd you do that? - I want to be invisible. It's why I think you went to your son's birthday party. Every part of you wanted to be there, so you were. The sooner you stop fighting this thing, the sooner you get control. Yeah, I've been trying to figure it out, analyzing my blood work... My DNA is completely changed. From the space dust? That's what my friends Arnold and Cyrus said. We met in Iceland. They think it's the asteroids. Would they talk to me? - Maybe let me study them? - I don't know where they are. They disappeared over the last year. Wait. You're telling me they went missing? Fell off the face of the earth from what I can tell. - Hmm. - [thunder rumbling] [voices whispering indistinctly] What is that? [Charlotte] You can see them, too? [thunder rumbling] [raindrops falling] [eerie wailing] [Charlotte screams] [screams] [groaning] [distorted snarling] Charlotte! Hold on! [grunts] [Charlotte screams] Charlotte! [Charlotte screams] [Charlotte screams] [screaming] Come on. Let's go, Charlotte. Come on. Let's go. [both grunt] [grunting] - [grunting] - [Charlotte screams] [grunts] [screams] - [grunting] - [Charlotte screams] [Charlotte screams] [screams] [grunting] [both screaming] [grunting] [Mark's wailing fades away] [screaming] [thunder rumbles] [rain pattering] [thunder crashes] [Mark] Hey, babe. Tell me how your day was. It's Dion's birthday today. You should be here. This wasn't the plan for us, Mark. We were supposed to do this together. Why did you do this to us? Just... secret lives, secret trips. You... You lied to me about what you were doing in New Orleans. [stammers] And... don't tell me... it was so you were protecting me. I don't want protection. I want my husband. I want my kid's father. [Mark] Yeah, that... that sounds great. How's Dion doing? I miss my little man. Dion's great. He's the best kid ever. I'm telling you, Nicole, that kid... is something special. He's gonna rule the world one day. Do you remember that time... I thought you were gonna miss Dion's birthday party? And then I turned around, and there you were. I just keep wishing that you would do that again. Our boy turned eight today, Mark. Where are you? [thunder crashes] [thunder crashes] [thunder crashes] [Pinchy trilling] [rain pattering] What are you doing out of bed, bug? What is it? Lightning. Okay, well, the lightning stopped. Go back to bed. [thunder crashes]
