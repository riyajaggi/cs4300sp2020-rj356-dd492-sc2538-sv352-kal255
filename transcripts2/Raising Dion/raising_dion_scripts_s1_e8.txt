 [Suzanne] We are BIONA Initiative. Creating climate solutions for a better world. Hey! Where is my son? - I'm sorry, ma'am. What's your name? - Dion! Ma'am, if you just take a seat, I'll have someone come talk to you. - Dion! - Ma'am. You can't go back there. Ma'am, you can't be back here without an escort. - Ma'am. - Dion! Ma'am! Stop! She's coming downstairs. - Ma'am! Stop! - [man on radio] Copy that.

 We have a code four approaching level five. - Di! - [alarm blaring] - [automated voice] Civilian entering L5. - She's coming down. Grab her! - Ma'am, stop! - Secure all exits. - Get out of my way. - Secure all exits. - Get out of my way! - Ma'am, stop! Ma'am! [alarm continues blaring] I got her. - Stop! - Stand down. Hey! Where is my son? [male guard] Hold your positions. [sobs] - [grunts] - [employees gasp] [yelling] Do I have your attention now?

 [Nicole sobs] [employees murmuring] Bring me my child, or I swear to God, I will tear this place up. Follow me. [upset breathing] [voices whispering indistinctly] You kidnapped my son. We rescued him. You ripped him from my arms, put him in a van, and drove off. We were under serious time constraints. The CDC put out the call for a level-three quarantine facility, of which, lucky for you, we are one. Lucky? He could be in a CIA black site right now, or worse. Worse? Who are you? In here. [breathes shakily] Where is Dion? He is safe. He is fine. - Take me to him now. - We need to have a conversation. This room is dedicated to our weather research. We pride ourselves on predicting wind patterns that allow us the kind of early warning that saves lives. I don't need a tour. I need my son. [remote beeps] Oh, my God. You left him in there all alone? He must be scared out of his mind. Do you know anything about children? I know a few things about your child. [remote beeps] How long have you been watching us? Right after the break-in at our lab. You haven't seen a hermit crab wandering around, by any chance? And, of course, there is the fox. I... I don't know what you're talking about. I assumed Pat told you the minute he left my office, but... we can do it this way. Before Dion's visit. After Dion's visit. Your son's abilities are symbiotic with the flora and fauna recovered from Iceland after the aurora event. Considering Mark's intense interest in that event, we suspect he was experiencing anomalies himself, and it appears that he passed them along to Dion. After Iceland, we began seeing these erratic micro storms all over the globe. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration flagged them, too. They appear and disappear quickly, leaving targeted devastation. Targeted. [Suzanne] One of these was outside your house. Another was near your lake cabin. I don't think that's a coincidence. I think the storms are drawn to your son. - So what do you want? - To study Dion. We need to understand why this is happening and what he's capable of. No. Oh, I wasn't asking for permission. The CDC has him on a 72-hour hold, and that period can be extended indefinitely if he's deemed a danger to the public. - But he's not a danger... - There again, I wasn't asking. We have enough aberrant data to keep him quarantined... well, forever. Which I don't want to do. But I'm not giving up the only human specimen I have. What if you had Mark's data? [hangs up receiver] You have Mark's data? He was studying himself. Changes to his DNA. And he kept in contact with people who experienced the event. In exchange, you let me take Dion home now. Also, I want all of this stuff. I want to know when these storms happened, where they happened, and if they will happen again. That's classified. Well, so is Mark's data. We'll set up a private portal. You upload your data, I'll upload mine. And one more thing. Just stop spying on us. Not gonna happen. I could tell you that we'll stop, but we won't, and the truth is, you don't want us to. Something dangerous is out there, and whether you believe me or not, we are trying to protect your son. I am not the enemy, Nicole. That... that is the enemy. [animal bellowing] [animal grunting] [sheep bleats] [animal grunting] [sheep bleats] [animal grunting] [animal whimpering] [sheep bleats] [Nicole] Dion. - Mom! - Hey, Bug. She's a cat. Yes, she is. [laughing] Good job, buddy. Are you afraid of me, too? No, no, no, I just... Don't I look hilarious? I mean, come on. [Nicole laughs] No! [exhales] [sheep bleats] My butt's hanging out. [Nicole laughs] Yeah, these things are weird. I was scared. I know. But it's gonna be better now. We're just gonna go home, okay? Where's, uh... where's your magic watch? Okay. All right, let's get you dressed. And, uh, Miss Suzanne and I, we just have to make a little trade. All right? And then we can get out of here. Okay? Got it? [food sizzling] ["Arms Of A Woman" by Amos Lee plays] - [Nicole] Hey. - Niki? Oh, my gosh, sweetie. How is he? - [Nicole] Tired. - Oh. ♪ I am at ease ♪ You didn't have to come over. Are you kidding me? After what you and little man just went through? I just... I wish you would've called me earlier, and I'd have busted down those doors with you. Yeah, well, you just lost your job, and... I didn't want you to get arrested, too. [chuckles] Something smells good. I made you shrimp and grits. It's after midnight. [laughs] [Kat] Are you hungry? Put him to bed. [voice breaking] I'll... I'll fix you a plate. ♪ Yeah, when she wakes me ♪ ♪ She takes me ♪ ♪ Yeah, when she wakes me ♪ ♪ She takes me back home ♪ Hey, little Bug. ♪ When she wakes me ♪ ♪ She takes me ♪ ♪ Back home ♪ [vehicle approaching] [brakes squeaking] [dramatic music plays] [whimpering] [grunts] You need a break? - Oh, no, no. No, I'm good. - Good answer. - [Pat exhales] - [sheep bleats] So, she just... She just gave all this to you? She didn't have much choice. She wanted her son. Does she know that you handed it off to me? Not yet. You'll tell her, I'm sure. From the number of times we've observed you going in and out of her apartment, seems like, uh, the two of you are pretty close. I mean, you were willing to lose your job for her. Well, I... I care about Dion. Uh-huh. [animal grunting] I'm sorry I didn't come clean to you about what happened. I was trying to respect Nicole's wishes. I swear it won't ever happen again. [sheep bleats] We'll see. So, what have you found? Uh, well, I've been looking at Dion's blood work, matched it up with Mark's data and, uh, our samples... And? And, uh, it... it's not good. It makes perfect sense why he ended up in the hospital with a high fever. He's... He's running too hard. Expand on that. - Um... - [animal grunting] In college, I drove this car. Um, it was a real gas guzzler, but it was the most dependable car I ever had, as long as I didn't drive it over 55. If I even tried to push it a hair too far, the engine would blow. The mechanic said that the car just wasn't built to drive that hard. And that's... that's Dion. I mean, picking up Cheez Doodles is one thing, but... if his powers get pushed too far... Like trying to cure a fox and ending up in the hospital. Yeah. Good thing that guy wasn't sick. Something that big probably would have killed him. [nervous exhale] Yeah. - Get some sleep. - Yeah. [footsteps depart] - [exhales] - [knocking] [footsteps enter] [Nicole] Um... How do you take your coffee? Cream, no sugar. You're early. I didn't expect you until tonight. Yeah. [exhales] I had to tell you what I found. Okay. All right. [Charlotte exhales] - The farmer, Walter. - Mm-hmm. [inhales] He, uh, got his abilities at the same time as me and Mark. His son did, too. Brayden. [inhales] Which means he's second generation, like Dion. Well... at least he still has his father to help him understand things, you know. Storm took him. [Nicole] What? [stammering] When? He was alive when Dion went to BIONA's labs. Well, he didn't stay alive very long. I can't let Dion leave this apartment. I have to go to work, and he has to go to school. I can stay with him. - What, forever? - Well, let's just get through today. [knocking] [Nicole] Hey. [Pat] Hey. Uh, I didn't get a call, so I'm here, just barreling through our awkward stage to take Dion to school. I mean, I'm not sure if he's going to school, uh, after the night he's had, but I... I wanted to check on him. Yeah, a lot's happened since the hospital. Yeah, I know. Um... Suzanne, uh, called me in late last night, asked me to look over the data that you gave her, the... Mark's data. So she knows you've been in on it now? Yeah. Um... What did she offer you in exchange? Besides Dion. Uh, just maps of the storm, and, uh, her assurances that she's on our side. Well, for what it's worth, I actually think she is. Or at least she's not not on your side. The aurora event caused some sort of extreme damage, and the land up there is literally dying. Huge crevices have opened up, and it's spreading, so she's just... [inhales] She's trying to figure out how to stop it. Right, and she thinks Dion can help with that. I mean, he... he reversed the disease in the fox. Maybe he can reverse the necrosis in Iceland, I... [laughs] - You know? - Does she really think that? [Pat] Uh, she's following the science. You know, everything that was changed by that event, Dion, the plants, the ground, uh, Mark, it's all... all pieces of the puzzle. - And she still hates me. - Yeah. [laughs] Yep. But, for now, I'll... I'll be there to watch her for you. - You don't have to do that. - Yeah, I do. Remember, we're... Nothing's changed. We're buds, amigos. [chuckles] [door opens] Pat! Hey, dude. Oh! They put me in a science room like E.T., but I'm okay now. - That is awesome. - So, taking me to school today? You know what? One second, honey. Um, I need to talk to him for a minute. [Pat] Yeah. Yeah. [Dion] Uh-oh. [inhales] - [door closes] - [exhales] Hey, buddy, come. Sit down. Bah, yes. [groans] [inhales deeply] [exhales] You can't go to school today. Why not? Honey, because it's too dangerous. I have to work on my science project. - Well, some things are more important. - Than science? - [Charlotte] Let him go to school. - What? Yes! I'll go with him. I'll... I'll hang with Dion all day. No. [Charlotte] Invisible, of course. But you can't tell anybody I'm there. Except Pat. Not even Pat. Nobody. Or you're not going. Okay. But what if... It'll be fine. I'll be with him every minute. Not in the bathroom. Everything's okay. Okay. - Bye, Mom. Love you. - Bye. Love you. [Charlotte] Don't worry. I've got it. [footsteps depart] - [indistinct chattering] - [phones ringing] [woman] Lewis Company. What do you think? - Oh, that's fire. [laughs] - I think you nailed it. Nicole nailed it, but I said yes to her, so you right, I nailed it. - Girl, you killed it. - Damn. Okay, I need one of those at my house. Take a picture and print it yourself. I don't have an unlimited budget. - Boy! I can't with him. [laughs] - [Rashad laughs] Okay, we're doing billboard and radio ads. I want you to work on the layout for the playbill. Well, I want health insurance. Oh, it's like that? [Rashad] Yeah, um, uh... [scoffs] Looks like somebody's getting promoted today. Thank you, and I'll get that to you by the end of today. Oh, you better. And be prepared to work hard. Insurance-coverage hard. [Willa] Oh, my God. Girlfriend! - [Rashad] Come on. Yes! - Yes! - You killed it. - Damn. Now you're gonna tell me you're too busy with your new promotion to meet at lunch. Are you kidding? I want to drag you on the dance floor right now. Oh, yeah? Think you can handle the big move? I can handle the big move. Can you handle it? Um, are you guys still talking about dancing? 'Cause I am confused. [Nicole laughs] - [Nicole sighs] - [Rashad laughs] - [Rashad] I can't shut this down. - [Willa] What is wrong with you? [Willa laughs] [Charlotte] Just go about your normal day. Forget I'm here. You're watching everything I do. It's like I'm being haunted by a ghost who knows my mom. [Charlotte] Well, don't do anything bad, and you've got nothing to worry about. [Dion sighs] - Oh, no. - Who's that? Mr. Campbell. He tried to suspend me. - [Charlotte] Why? - Mom said he grew up with some bad ideas. [Charlotte] About what? Who people are based on what they look like. He just assumed I was a bad kid. [Charlotte] Oh, is that right? You just walk on ahead. Stay out of his way. I'll be right behind you. [children laugh] [school bell rings] [Charlotte] All right, come on, Dion. Let's keep moving. There's nowhere for me to sit over there, so I'll be here near the door. - [Esperanza giggles] - Don't copy me. - Oh, man. - [Charlotte] What? They're all giggly again. - [Charlotte] You jealous? - No. Who are you talking to, weirdo? Hey, Dion, look. Ew, no way. Unicorns? Thought we were drawing cars. Hey, can we talk about the project? Um, we were thinking that you could make the presentation, since you're so good at science. Okay. Great. Hey, Jonathan, let's work on that YouTube thing. [phone rings in the background] [woman] Okay, class, that's lunch. One hour. One hour break.

[laughs] Well, school's done at 3:00, so, um... I don't know, brush up on your multiplication tables. [Charlotte] Right. Bye. [disconnects call] Uh, so I was thinking that we could do "In The Light." [chuckles] No. - No? - Let's do something a little different. Try to keep up. Okay. [laughs] Ready? Yeah, you're ready.

May I speak to you for a minute? Uh, yeah. You wanna go say hi to Pinchy? Grown-up talk. [Nicole chuckles] Did you, uh, find something? [Charlotte sighs] Yeah. This, um... This thing is much bigger than I ever imagined. [sighs] [inhales] I've been trying to track down the whereabouts of some of the people on Mark's list from the aurora event. [Nicole] Mm-hmm. Seven of them have been reported missing. And those are just the ones I found. Missing, not... dead from some freak illness? Vanished without a trace. And look at this. This is... This is the BIONA map of where the storms have touched down. Kerry Phillips, reported missing June 6th, 2014, - Atlanta, Georgia. Storm. - I know that name. Right. Dr. Morton Lungstad, Alesund, Norway. Reported missing May 22nd, 2018. Storm. [Nicole] Jill Noonan. She went missing in a freak storm at the lake across from us. And look at this. - New Orleans, August 12th, 2017. - [Nicole] Mark. [sighs] A storm killed them all. It hunted them. It was outside my kid's window. This... serial killer was outside my kid's window. What am I supposed to do? Run. Hide. [Nicole] I can't do that to Dion. I mean... Living life on the run, no... no home, no friends, in constant fear. What kind of life is that? Mine. I'm sorry, I didn't... I wouldn't wish this on anybody. But until we can figure out how to stop this thing, we don't have any other choice. I mean, I was lucky. I didn't have any friends or... family that I cared about. And you call that lucky? [half-hearted laugh] I had nothing much to give up. You are gonna have a problem with that. [inhales] [sighs] Stay with us. What? We're your family. Help me protect my son. Teach him how to survive. When the time comes and we have to run, we... we run, but until then, let's... let's stick together. Stay with us. [knocking] [Dion humming] - Good morning. - [Nicole] Hey. Uh... - You good? - Uh, yeah, I'll go get him. Cool, I'll just... [inhales] stand here in the hallway, like a dope. [Nicole humming] All right, Pat's here. Remember our deal? - Don't say anything about Charlotte. - Good job. Oh, let me see your teeth. [Pat clears throat] [small gasp] [exhales] [Dion] Pat! Hey! Are you ready to go? - Let's do this thing. - All right. - Bye, Mom. - Have a good day, Bug. - Love you. - [Dion] Love you, too! Hey, hey, hey. Hey, so, uh... so, who was over for breakfast this morning? A friend. Your friend? Mom's friend. - I'm not allowed to talk about it. - Okay. So, this friend, is it, like, a new friend, or is it someone... I'm not asking for a name, I'm just... I'm concerned. You have to be careful who you trust. Mom said we can trust this friend with everything. Plus, this elevator's too slow. I'm gonna be late for school. Meet you downstairs. Last one's a rotten egg! - [indistinct chattering] - [phone ringing in the background] [cell phone rings] Hello. Uh, yes, I did. Yeah, I was just letting you guys know that my friend Charlotte would be picking up Dion again from school today. Look, I already sent one yesterday. Yeah, just email it to me, and I will send it back to you. [telephone ringing] [woman] Lewis Company. [sighs] We've got a problem. The posters are all jacked up. They don't match the playbills. You need to go and make this right. - [Nicole] Okay. - [keyboard clacking] Girl, that is rude. [Nicole] I'm so sorry. I just need to fill out a form for Dion's school again, authorizing my friend to pick him up and... done. The original order form, receipt, everything. Get down there now and fix this. Materials go out tomorrow. Okay, got it.

Don't guilt me. - I'm not. - I know exactly what you're thinking. Oh, so you're a mind reader now? You're thinking this is some self-defeating BS, right? I'm keeping myself too busy.

This... almost looks ready. How you doing over here? Okay. I like that. How's Team Weather Control doing? Me and Esperanza are doing great. Esperanza created a simulated storm in a jar. I saw it on YouTube, and Jonathan helped me. Storm in a jar. [laughs] I love it. What else? - I have a speech. - Yeah? Let's hear it. [clears throat] Storms are created when a warm front meets a cold front. The more difference there is between these two temperatures, the stronger the storm. You've done your research. He's not done. [inhales, exhales] Storms kill people. My dad... Um... my dad worked at BIONA to find a way to stop storms in the future, but what if I told you that there's a way to stop a storm right now? Ladies and gentlemen, introducing the storm extinguisher! And that's when Jonathan comes in with the storm extinguisher. Where is it? It's not... I mean... I didn't finish it. Well, today's the day for me to approve your projects. If you didn't do the assignment, then I don't know how... He did! Show him. It's dumb. I didn't know what to do. What's the hose for? Uh, you know, the, uh... - Um... - Cold air... from a liquid nitrogen canister. [stammers] Yeah, the cold air stuff. - It, uh... - [Dion groans] Changes the temperature of the storm and takes away its power. Okay. Wait. You... you made this? Yeah. - And the rubber straps? - [Jonathan] Well... I figured if there's a storm, there's gonna be some lightning, and rubber stops lightning, I think. [Mr. Fry laughs] It's a little more complicated than that. No, but keep doing research. Good thinking, though. When will it be finished? Today, after school. Promise. Okay. You've got until tomorrow, okay? [school bell rings] - I can't come over after school today. - You don't need to. Jonathan and I are gonna play Zelda after school anyway. What? We'll finish his part of the project first. - You're playing Zelda? - [Esperanza] Yeah. I would've invited you, but you hate Zelda. I don't hate Zelda. Hey, Jonathan. Come here. [Esperanza] What do they want? They're so mean to him. I don't even know why he talks to them. They're his friends. Uh, not really. They're being nice to him one day, but then, the next, they're making fun of him. Where he lives, his dad... Hey, what's up, guys? Uh, I'm gonna go to the skate park with the guys. But we promised we would finish the Storm Killer! - You coming or not? - I'm not waiting. What about the project? You do your part. Don't worry about mine. Hey, it's due tomorrow. It's our project, too. - It's okay, I'll do it. - [Dion] What? - [Jonathan] Hey. - [Dion grunts] She'll do it better anyway. Hey. Come with me. Forget about Jonathan. I wanna show you something fun. Quick. [electricity crackles] What are you doing? Shh. What are you doing? Who needs skateboards when... you can fly? Dion, put me down! I used to only be able to lift Froot Loops. Put me down! Wait! Here comes the best part. You're gonna miss it. Wait. What are you doing with my legs? Put me down! Dion! Why did you do that? - Why are you mad? - You took me out of my chair. You lifted me out of my chair. Why would you do that? - I wanted you to... - Walk? Yes. Open the door. Thank you. Hey. What are you doing here? Uh... [voice breaking] I told myself, you know... if you let something go and it's meant to be, it'll come back to you. I'm so stupid. Um... Pat, I don't really know what's going on with you, but I'm running late to the printer, so can we just talk about this later? - Um, no. - [Nicole] No? No. I'm, uh... I'm so tired of this. Whenever you need me, I'm there. To take Dion to school, for... for pizza. You ask and I drop everything for you, and I'm there with a big old smile on my face. Why are you doing this now? Uh, I think you are taking advantage of me. Because you know that I... Because you know that I have feelings for you. I'm sorry, I... I never meant to... But... you're right. I, um... I shouldn't have continued to lean on you like that. So, are you... are you, uh, seeing that guy? Excuse me? [deep breath] This morning when I picked Dion up, there was an extra plate at the table. Was it him? Or, like... That's none of your business. Really? - [Nicole] Yes. - Hmm. And I appreciate everything that you've done for me and Dion, but... who I have breakfast with, who I whatever with, it's... it's none of your business. Well, but see, the thing is Nicole, you are my business. Okay? I've been keeping your secrets. I've been risking my job for you. And you... you... [upset laugh] [sniffs] You let me think I had a shot, I guess, so I could just keep on being - your pathetic little errand boy. - Okay, um... This conversation's over. Actually, um... I have to get back to work. Oh, all right. Well, we'll finish it tonight when I bring Dion home. You know what? You don't have to, because I have it taken care of. What? And you know, I think maybe we should just... take a break. [scoffs] Take a break. From what? From you spending time with Dion, with me. Well... [scoffs] You're not keeping me from Dion. - Excuse me? - [Pat] He loves me. Hell, I spend more time with him than you. This conversation is so over. You stay away from me, and you stay away from Dion. [students chattering indistinctly] I don't get it. Why is Esperanza so mad? Oh. Let us get out of this place, away from all these people, and then we will discuss your disaster with Esperanza. [cell phone beeping] - Hey. - Hey, is Dion with you? Yes, I just picked him up. Okay, don't tell him, but Pat and I just got into the weirdest fight. [Charlotte] Uh, want me to do a thing? One zap and he'll never pee right again. No... [sighs] It's fine. - He just needs to stay away and cool off. - [Charlotte] Well, we're on our way home. - [Dion] Can you take me to Esperanza's? - No. No. Hey, are you okay? [Nicole] No, I'm mad! He acted like he was entitled to something from me and accused me of seeing someone behind his back. Is his back even relevant? His back has nothing to do with me. Look, you know, you're getting a little lost in this. Look, I tried to be honest with him. I tried, at least, and he still came away from it expecting something from me. I really need to get out of here. Can we talk about this later? Just don't let Pat talk to him, okay? And... and I'll see you guys at home. [disconnects call] [Dion] It wasn't that bad. [Charlotte] I was there. It was bad. If I were in a wheelchair, I would want to fly. Well, you are not Esperanza. Everybody wants to fly. I think you've just proven that that is not true. [Charlotte sighs] What do you know about her? Well, why is she in the chair? How long has she been in the chair? Has she ever walked? Dude, you've been friends with her how long? And you've never talked about it? You've never even asked? I don't think about it. It's just... It's Esperanza. Now, that, I think she would want to hear you say. [man coughing] [coughing continues] - [coughing] - [Charlotte] Um... Why don't you go inside, and... I will join you in a few minutes. - [Dion] Can I FaceTime with Esperanza? - [Charlotte] Absolutely. [exhales] [exhales] [sniffs] - Excuse me. - Pat, right? I'm a friend of Nicole's. Oh. Hi, I'm just gonna go say hi to to Dion. Actually, uh, Dion's had a really long day. He's... he's really not up for company. - Well, he'll wanna see me. - Nicole asked me not to let you see him. [scoffs] What? She doesn't want you to see him. I'm sorry. That's ridiculous. [exhales] Well, it's her choice. Okay, uh, you know what? I want to talk to Dion. You know, why don't you just go home and take some time? [groans in pain] You know what? I don't have time. Okay. Nicole and I just had a small disagreement, okay? - I'm practically the kid's father. - Whoa. You are entitled. She called me entitled? Well, you know what? Yeah, actually, I am entitled to see my godson, so get the hell out of my way. I... said... - [electricity crackles] - no. [scoffing] I should have killed you in New Orleans. [electricity crackling] [electricity crackling loudly] No. [lightning crackling] [cell phone rings] Hello? - [Suzanne] Where are you? - Why? There's a micro storm forming right now at your building. - Come to BIONA. We can protect you here. - No, no, Dion is at home. Jesus. [thunder rumbles] Come on, come on. Pick up, pick up. [thunder rumbles] [Charlotte screams] You can't have Dion! [groaning] [Charlotte groaning] [grunts] [Charlotte grunting] [Charlotte] No! [Charlotte screaming] No! [dramatic music playing]
