 (HONKING) (LAUGHING) Hey, come on, you guys! This is supposed to be a picnic, not war games! Hold it! Hold it! Hold it! Now you know the rules. Little people first. (KIDS HOLLERING) That's a little person, you're a little person. That's it. You go right in there. Go in there, little person. I gotta learn to yell like that, Harry. It really gives you authority. Well, I'd say you are doing just fine, Jaime. I remember this class before you took over. You mean it was worse?

 Oh, you're doing just wonders with them, the little angels. Hey, Teddy. Teddy. Come here, please. (KIDS CHATTERING) Did you spring a leak? May I have the water gun, please? Aw, Miss Sommers You can have it back after the picnic. Thank you. Little angels, huh? He filled this thing with ice water. Well, it could have been worse. Do we have everything? I think so. The food is in the bus, right? Yeah. Okay. Did we get charcoal?

 I got it. Okay. I know what I forgot. I forgot the baseball equipment. We can't have a picnic without a baseball game. That's right. Oh! I'm sorry. Better get in the bus. Well, we'll stop by the garage and pick up my baseball stuff. JAIME: All right! What's going on here? Hey, excuse me. Don't I know you from someplace? Well, could be. My name's Harry Anderson. Well, you must be thinking of somebody else. (CHILDREN CHEERING) Thought this was your first time in Ojai. Friend of yours? (SIGHING) No, friends I remember. Harry Anderson... That's not his real name. It'll come to me. (BIONIC POWERS ACTIVATING) Careful! (JAIME CHATTERING) Okay. Who else is carrying something? HARRY: There. You've got it? JAIME: Yeah. You hold on to your bottom, too. Pardon the expression. Here we go. No, wait a minute. Wait a minute. (STAMMERING) Let me take that, hon. Oh, that's all right. I can get it. I got it. Sure? Yeah. I got it. I got it. Oh, I think I'm going to help you with that, Harry. Come on. Come on. I must be getting old. All right, wait. (LAUGHING) (SIGHING) We got it. There we go. No, leave that alone. You want any help, Miss Sommers? Oh, honey, that's okay. You guys go and play. Have a good time. Thank you, Miss Sommers. Leave it, okay? You shouldn't carry a heavy load like that alone. You could hurt yourself. Oh, you're such an old mother hen. Why don't you go start the fire? Get those charcoals going. Okay. Excuse me. (LAUGHS) (BIONIC POWERS ACTIVATING) Hey, when are you gonna organize that softball game? What, and let these kids miss out on the world famous Anderson hamburger? No, step aside. That's okay. I'll do it, Harry. No, I love to cook. Harry, you gotta be about the sweetest guy that ever lived. How come some lady hasn't snatched you up yet? Well, 'cause I always say no. I've been waiting for you, honey. But I should've known, by the time you grew up, I'd be way too old for you. You're not old. I used to drive you to school when you were a teenager. Yeah, and I was in love with you then, so that has nothing to do with it. You ever been married? Not talking, eh? You know, in all the years I've known you, I still don't know very much about you. Better fess up, Harry Anderson. (IN GERMAN ACCENT) We have our methods, you know. Listen, will you let an old man keep a few secrets, for crying out loud. Have you got any hot dogs around here? RAINES: Car's all fixed. Let's get out of this hick town. You know, I can't get that guy Anderson off my mind. Are you kidding? What's so important about a small-town mechanic? I don't know. It's like... It's his face. It's like I seen a ghost or something. I mean, it keeps bugging me. Look, we still have a two hour drive to Bakersfield. Let's hit the road. Yeah. I sure wish I could place him. Well, maybe it'll come to you in your sleep. That happens to me sometimes. Hey, put that in the glove compartment, would you? (HOLLERING) (CHATTERING) Boy, those hamburgers were good! I'm the captain, okay? You, you and you, all right? All right. All right. I'm catcher. Come on. (CLAMORING) BOY 1: Come on you guys, get your mitts. BOY 2: All right. (BOYS CONTINUE CHATTERING) All right? BOY 1: Take first base, all right? BOY 2: Okay. Here we go. BOY 3: More. More. Put it right in there! Uh-oh. Here comes trouble. Hi, guys. Got any objections to a few more players? Oh, come on, Miss Sommers. We want to play for real, not with a bunch of girls. Well, it seems to me that a real baseball team has nine players, right? This is what's happening to my little league. They're forcing a girl on us 'cause her old man's got clout. I don't see what you have against playing baseball with girls. They ruin the game. They're not good enough. (GIRLS DISAGREEING) Like, they can't hit... Why can't they play by themselves? There's only one ball, dummy! Well, if you want it so much, you can have it! Hey, come on now. Getting mad is not gonna help the situation any. Now how do you know they're not good enough if you don't play with them? Hey, everybody knows that girls don't play sports as well as boys. Oh, you better watch it, Mark. You're talking to a top-seeded tennis player. Tell you what. I'll make you a little deal. We're gonna test out this theory of yours. You pitch to me... (EXCLAIMING EXCITEDLY) And if you can strike me out, you guys can play alone all day long today. (AGREEING EXCITEDLY) All right? BOY: All right. Let's go. Need an umpire. Who's gonna be the umpire? I'll be the umpire. Okay. Go! Right over the plate! Hey! What is this? I'm a girl. Hey, you scared of me? Are you kidding? Hey, can I throw it as hard as I want? Yeah, make your best shot. Come on. But remember, if I make a hit, you guys gotta start your game over again and anybody who wants to play, plays. (GIRLS CHEERING) She ain't got a chance. Hasn't got a chance, thank you. Hasn't got a chance. Come on, let's play ball! Hasn't. Yeah! Come on, hit it. Come on, Miss Sommers. (CHEERING) Strike one! (CLAMORING) Come on! Strike two! BOY: Yeah! Now we got her. (GIRLS CHATTERING) I think you're in over your head, Jaime. I'm just warming up. Come on. Hey, do you want me to ease up a little bit? Just pitch the ball, all right? Yeah! You can do it! BOY: Come on, Mark, you got her now. (BIONIC POWERS ACTIVATING) Well, you got a hit, but you lost our ball. Gee, I don't know my own strength sometimes. GIRL: I found it! Now you guys have got to let us play! BOY: Okay, but I hope you're as good as Miss Sommers. JAIME: Goodbye. See you tomorrow. HARRY: Only one more bunch to drop off. Last stop, Sutter Street. KIDS: (SINGING) And Bingo was his name-o B-I-N-G-O! B-I-N-G-O! B-I-N-G-O! And Bingo was his name-o! There was a farmer had a dog And Bingo was his name-o I-N-G-O! I-N-G-O! I-N-G-O!

There was a farmer had a dog And Bingo was his name-o (KIDS CLAPPING) G-O! G-O! G-O! And Bingo was his name-o! There was a farmer had a dog And Bingo was his name-o (KIDS CLAPPING) O! O! O! And Bingo was his name-o! (TIRE BURSTING) (TIRES SCREECHING) Hey, what's happening, Miss Sommers? Sit down. Sit down, Mark. Hold on! Is everyone all right? Uh-huh. I think so. Oh, Harry, look! The door's jammed! Try the back door, Harry. Try the back door. Let him through, kids. (BIONIC POWERS ACTIVATING) Harry, I got the door open. Come on. Get out of here. Hurry up. The gas tank may explode. Come on. Hurry up. Hurry up! Come on, kids, quickly. Out! Stay away from the fire. How did you do that? Come on, Harry, get out of here. (COUGHING) Where's Caroline? HARRY: She must be in the bus. Caroline! Caroline! (CONTINUES COUGHING) Are you two all right? I think so! You saved her life! Yeah, you're a hero. Bet you'll get your picture in the paper. Oh, Teddy. I got it. You got what? This guy, Harry Anderson. Now I know where I saw him before. It was Chicago, 1960. I was upstate New York in '60, in the pen. Well, I wasn't, and his name isn't Harry Anderson. It's Walter Kreuger. And he's gonna be worth a lot of money to us. We're going back to Ojai. How you doing, Harry? How you doing, Hal? Okay. (HONKING) Would you come in for a minute? Well, sure. Is something wrong? No. Come on. Thank you. Well, where are all the kids? It's after 3:00. KIDS: Surprise! Surprise! Hey, wait, wait! What is all this? We just wanted to say thank you, Mr. Anderson. Me, especially. Yeah! And we made this for you. 'Cause you're the greatest. Well, thank you. Hey, this is really wonderful. Nothing like this ever happened to me before. And I didn't have a thing to do with it. It was all their idea. Oh, yeah, but you sure deserve it, too, Mr. Anderson. (KIDS AGREEING) Now, wait, it's after 3:00. On the bus. Come on now. MARK: See you later, Miss Sommers. Goodbye, Mark. Hurry up now. Goodbye, Miss Sommers. Goodbye. Everybody. Bye-bye. I'll see you in a minute. I'll be right there. JAIME: What's the matter? Don't you like the picture? They shouldn't have done this, Jaime. Well, don't be so modest. I mean, you deserve a little recognition, Harry. You even hit the big time. The wire service picked it up, and you're gonna be a hero all over the country. Well, you know, for a hero you don't look very happy. Well, I don't see why there's all this fuss over it. I just did what anybody else would've done. Well, maybe so, but nobody else did it. We're awfully proud of you. Well, it's after 3:00. I gotta get that bus rolling. I'll see you later, Jaime. MORGAN: Operator, I want to call Chicago. Area code 312. And the number is 7-2-1-8-8-4-1, person to person to Mr. Stone. Tell him Glen Morgan is calling, please. (PHONE RINGING) Stone. MORGAN: Mr. Stone? This is Glen Morgan. Do you remember me? I've been working the coast the last couple of years. Yeah, I remember you. I want to throw a name at you. Walter Kreuger. You're going a long ways back, Morgan. Yeah, well, I was just wondering if Kreuger ever turned up. Why? Well, let's say I know where he is. Is that worth something to you? Let's say I'm interested. Well, I ain't 100% sure yet. You playing games with me, Morgan? Where are you calling from? Look, I don't want to waste your time, Stone. You know what I mean? Maybe I got the wrong man, so... I'll make sure, and then I'll call you back, okay? You make real sure, Morgan. I know your work. You're sloppy. You make mistakes. I don't like mistakes. Look, you think I don't know that? Now what about the money? I mean, I figure if this guy is Kreuger, he's gotta be worth 10, 15 thou to you, right? Ten, maybe. If it's Kreuger. Yeah, I'll call you tomorrow. Ten or 15 Gs for this guy? What did this guy do? Well, it ain't what he did, it's what he saw. But if this guy is Kreuger, I wonder how much he'd pay us not to tell Stone about him? You double-cross Stone and he'll kill you. Oh, come on. Relax. We'll turn him over to Stone, just not right away, that's all. I mean, we'll get the money from Stone, but we'll get the money from Kreuger, too. I don't know, Morgan. I do. And the first thing in the morning, we start asking questions about Mr. Harry Anderson. Ow! Ouch! Fool thing! What's wrong? Mmm. Ajax threw a shoe this morning, and the blacksmith's out of town for a week. I'm just not having any luck with this thing. Well, it's no wonder. You're supposed to be doing it under a spreading chestnut tree. Very funny. Problem is getting the shoe to fit. 'Course if I had a forge... You don't have a forge, but you got me. Here. What, it's too small, huh? I just bend it? Try it. Okay. (BIONIC POWERS ACTIVATING) (LAUGHING) How's that? See if that works. Well, I'll be darned. Oh, come on, Jim, you're such a con artist. Give me the nails. (VEHICLE APPROACHING) Wonder who that could be. Hmm. Be right back. Okay. Ready for this, kid? (AJAX GRUNTING) (BIONIC POWERS ACTIVATING) Okay. You're welcome, Ajax. Couple of fellas want to talk to you about the accident. Oh! Okay. Miss Sommers, we represent the Midwestern Casualty Insurance Company. We'd like... Sit down, please. Oh, thank you. We'd... We'd like to ask you some questions about what happened day before yesterday. You guys sure got here fast, all the way from Chicago? Oh, no, no. That's the main office. We cover the western half of the United States. The driver of the school bus, Mr. Anderson. Now, we need some background on him, and I understand that you've known him for quite awhile. Listen, this was not his fault. And I think if you read that police report, you're gonna find that there is absolutely nothing in it. No, no, no. Wait a minute. You're misunderstanding me. I'm not saying it's his fault. But he was driving the bus and we do have to make out a report, you understand. You see, we can't find any record of him before he came to Ojai. Now, that was 15 years ago? More or less. Well, do you know where he came from, or where his family is? Harry never really talked about his family much. Did he to you, Jim? Not a word, come to think of it. Uh-huh. So actually you don't know where he lived before he came to Ojai? No. Well, we won't waste any more of your time. You've been very helpful. Oh, that's all right. Thank you. We'll let ourselves out. Thank you. What's wrong? It is very strange that those two guys didn't ask one question about the accident, you know that? No, just about Harry. That's right. MORGAN: Nobody knows anything about him before he got here. That still doesn't prove he's Walter Kreuger. Stop worrying. He's Kreuger. We'll get it out of him. JAIME: Midwestern Casualty Insurance Company, huh? No, that's right. It's George Harris. No, he was just here a few minutes ago. He does work for you. In Ohio? Not in California? Okay, thank you very much. (PHONE RINGING) (RINGING) (CAR ENGINE REVVING) (ENGINE CONTINUES REVVING) (STOPS ENGINE) You fellas back again? (CHUCKLES) Yeah, looks like we are. Saw your picture in the newspaper. Maybe you can guess why we're here. No. Chicago, 15 years ago? Walter Kreuger. I don't know the name. I'm sorry. Well, ain't it funny how much you look like this Kreuger. I mean, especially since there's a bounty on his head for $10,000. Guy by the name of Stone. Yeah, he put up the money. Stone. Does that name ring a bell with you? Would you like me to put in a call to Stone, Mr. Anderson? Now that was 15 years ago. That was another part of my life. Is that a fact? Well, I wonder how Stone would feel about it, seeing as there's no statute of limitations on murder. Well, what do you want from me? Well, I'll tell you. Stone will pay us $10,000 to tell him where you are. How much will you pay us not to tell Stone? Well, I haven't got that kind of money. After 15 years you must have something. Well, I haven't got any cash. Everything I own is tied up in this garage. Come on. Now you've got friends. You must own this place by now. A smart guy like you can come up with 20 grand. Considering the alternative. Well, I can't possibly... MORGAN: Try, Kreuger. You try real hard. We'll give you till Monday. Now you come up with enough money, we don't call Stone, everything is okay. You're off the hook. All right? Well, I'll... I'll try. Yeah, I'll try. That's good. Oh, by the way, my friend over here and me, we got a bet going, see. He says you're gonna run away. I says, "No, guy is too smart for that." But you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna keep an eye on you till Monday. Because, you see, if I lose the bet, I gotta kill you. I mean, Stone will pay the 10 grand, dead or alive. Do you know what I mean? I mean, you get the point? All right. All right. I'll get the money somehow. That's a good man. Good. Good man. See you Monday. (GUN CLICKING) Harry? Oh, over here, hon. I gotta talk to you. Well, I'll talk to you later. I've got a pile of things to do. Well, can't it wait, though? I think this is important. What's wrong with you? Well, nothing's wrong. (STAMMERING) I just don't have time. Harry, do you have a gun? Harry, you're in trouble. Now, look, Jaime, I don't want to get you involved with things that you don't understand. Well, that gun's not gonna help you solve anything. Now will you leave me alone? Harry, I can't. I've known you too long. You think you have. Who is Walter Kreuger? Harry, I care so much about you. And I know this may sound funny, but I can help you. If you just tell me what it is, and who Walter Kreuger is. Walter Kreuger is my real name. Now, in Chicago, I worked for a man who ran a nightclub, who did business with the mob. Now, I was a comedian. I didn't realize that he was cheating the syndicate. Till one day a man shows up. A hit man, a real pro. He killed my boss, and I saw him do it. His name was Stone. So, what did you do? Well, I ran. I didn't wait for the police. They wanted me to testify. But I was scared. When they couldn't find me, they ran my picture in the paper. That's when they put out an APB on me. So then you came to Ojai and changed your name? Right. See, after a couple of months, well, the cops stopped looking, but Stone didn't. Those two guys recognized you then. Yeah. They want $10,000, or they'll tell Stone where I am. You see, I'm still a threat to him. There's no statute of limitation on murder. Harry, that means your testimony can still put Stone away. Yeah, I guess I could. I have a friend in Washington who could help you, and he can guarantee you protection. Will you let me call him and explain the situation? Well, honey, you don't understand. What other alternatives have you got? Are you gonna run again? You gonna use that gun? Offer your testimony and ask for protection. Harry, this guy, Stone, can't hurt you if he's in jail. Oh, please let me try. MORGAN: I know what I'm doing, Raines. I hope so. I do. Now, the first thing we do is call Stone. We tell him to arrive Monday afternoon. Now, that gives us time to get the money from Kreuger. Now when Stone gets back... I read the papers, too, gentlemen. Come in. I want to hear what you've been up to. And where we could find our Mr. Kreuger. That's right, Oscar, Harry can provide an eye witness account of the murder. Sounds good, Jaime. I'll call the Justice Department, get somebody to pick up Harry right away. Terrific. And, listen, you two better get someplace where it's safe. Um. How about the Air Force Base? Good idea. I'll talk to you soon. Okay. Bye-bye. All right. Get your stuff together 'cause I think we'll be safer at the air base. And, Harry, trust me, all right? My friend Oscar's been known to do miracles. Okay. RAINES: That school teacher's here. School teacher? She's a friend of Kreuger's, works at the air base. STONE: Get rid of her. Scare her off. I don't care how you do it. I want Kreuger alone. You got it. They're back. Now, you get out of sight. No, Harry! Please, don't. Now, will you listen to me? These guys are dangerous. Now, I'll talk to them. Now, go! Get out of here. Hide someplace. Well, what do you want? I told you you'd get your money. Now, look, I know your girlfriend's around here someplace, Kreuger. Now where is she? There's nobody here but me. All right, look around. Now, wait a minute. You guys stay right where you are! Are you joking? Cover him. (BIONIC POWERS ACTIVATING) (BIONIC POWERS ACTIVATING) Harry, get out of here! (BIONIC POWERS ACTIVATING) (CAR ENGINE STARTING) MORGAN: Hey, Stone! That's our car! Howdy, Miss Sommers. Hi. You working on Saturday? No. We'd like to see the duty officer. Do you know if he's in his office? I believe he is, yeah. Thanks. STEVE: This is Colonel Steve Austin. Patch me through to Jaime Sommers at the Ventura Air Force Base. Steve? Yeah. How you doing? JAIME: Fine. Hey, you coming to pick up Harry? Sure. I used to ride on his school bus. That's right. Where are you? I can barely hear you. Somewhere over Oklahoma. Already? Yeah. You know, Oscar reached a friend in the Justice Department. You were right, Jaime. This fella Stone's a hot item. I'll be there in about two hours to pick up Harry. Oh, fantastic. It'll be good to see you, too. Have a good flight now. Goodbye, Jaime. Bye. He's gonna be here in two hours. I can't believe it. Two hours ago I was ready to run and never see Ojai again. Sometimes you just gotta have a little faith in your friends, Harry. I'm so glad you stayed. MILLS: No, I'll only talk to the chief. Yes, I'll hold. Chief, do you want me to notify the state police and tell 'em you can't find these two hoods? All right. Look, make the charge assault with a deadly weapon. That's just for starters. Right. Okay, now keep in touch. Six men on the Ojai police force and it sounds like the chief has 'em all working on a stolen TV repair truck. (CHUCKLES) How do you do? Well, what can I do for you? I have to go to the NCO Club. It's an emergency. What's wrong? TV set's on the fritz. The basketball game starts in about 20 minutes. Now, that's an emergency. You better get going. Okay. Oh, Sergeant, you got the time? You know, it's funny about a classroom with no kids in it. Doesn't seem right somehow. That's 'cause you're not a teacher. (CHUCKLES) Say, Jaime, back at the garage, those things you did... I've never seen anything like that. What did I do? I knocked over a barrel of oil. No big deal. How're you feeling? Like I'm waking up from a 15 year nightmare. Oh, Harry, it must've been awful. I can't even imagine it. Well, lonely, maybe. The worst part was being afraid to have a family, have anyone care about me. Everybody cares about you. Oh, you know what I mean. But maybe that's all over now, thanks to you. No maybes about it, kiddo. And, Harry Anderson, it is never too late. You got nothing to worry about from now on. Harry, as long as we're here, I think I'm gonna run over to the supply room and get some things, okay? Mmm-hmm. Need any help? Oh, no, it's okay. Be right back. Hello. Hello, Walter Kreuger. Did you really think I'd forget after all these years? Harry! STONE: Kreuger! Kreuger! (GUNSHOT) (BIONIC POWERS ACTIVATING) Kreuger! (BIONIC POWERS ACTIVATING) Kreuger? (BIONIC POWERS ACTIVATING) Listen! Listen! Are you all right? I thought you were hurt! No. No, he missed me. Well, what did you do to him? Uh... I don't know. It all happened so fast. I don't even remember. Who is he? Well, that's Stone. He's the killer! Yeah. You know, I didn't even know that. I passed him in the hall. Are you all right? Well, lam now. Well, we better get some help. I think you're about all the help a fella needs. Thanks, Jaime. Harry, Jaime. Hi. It's great to see you again, Steve. We've got some people in Washington who are anxious to talk to you about your evidence against Stone. Oh, no more anxious than I am. We have a little surprise for you, too, kiddo. We've got Stone already in confinement. You guys don't fool around, do you? No, of course not. Well, we're cleared for immediate takeoff if you've taken care of things here. Well, Jaime's taken care of everything. I'll see you in a few weeks, huh? All right. You'd better. 'Cause I don't know how long I can take care of those kids without you. I think you could take care of just about anything. Yeah, almost. Bye. Goodbye, Jaime. Bye. That's a remarkable woman, Steve. If I told you the things she did, you'd never believe me. STEVE: We all know Jaime's special, but what kind of things are you talking about? Well... No, it's probably just my imagination. (LAUGHING) You'd think I was crazy.
