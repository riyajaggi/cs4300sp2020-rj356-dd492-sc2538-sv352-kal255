 OSCAR: Memo to the Secretary. Top Secret. From Oscar Goldman, Office of Scientific Investigation. Subject... The Bionic Woman, Jaime SOMMERS. Dear Mr. Secretary... nobody is more aware than I am of the millions of dollars that we've spent... in making Jaime SOMMERS bionic. But I wonder if it's altogether fair for us to count on her services... after all she's been through. As you may recall it all started... when our six million dollar bionic man, Steve Austin, was reunited with Jaime...

 who had been his childhood sweetheart. After a tragic accident, she became the world's first bionic woman. She and Steve were planning to marry. (SCREAMS) OSCAR: But Jaime's body was rejecting her bionics. But Dr. Michael Marchetti wouldn't give up, even at death. Please, Rudy, let me try! OSCAR: Using revolutionary new cryogenic techniques, Michael did save Jaime. (DEFIBRILLATOR SHOCKS) (STEADY BEEP) OSCAR: But when Jaime saw Steve again... Who are you? OSCAR: Jaime had suffered brain damage. Her memory was gone. Steve decided it was best not to tell Jaime of their past love...

 because with Jaime's flashes of memory, came pain. No! Jaime's flashes of memory and pain continued... and led to near disaster during the mission... against the refinery owned by Carlton Harris. It was Steve who finally realized what was causing Jaime the most pain. It's me! What're you talking about? I'm not good for Jaime. Well, what do we do? Send her to Rudy's other complex in Colorado Springs. Away from here, away from Ojai. Away from you? Away from me. Bye . Bye . OSCAR: Mr. Secretary, as I dictate this... Jaime is in the operating room one last time. Drs. Marchetti and Wells feel that she is strong enough to take the risk. If the operation is successful, her memory will be restored. If not... Mr. Secretary, I'll keep you informed. (TYPING) (MAIN TITLE THEME) RUDY: She's doing well. MICHAEL: Yeah. RUDY: What percentage of her damaged brain cells you ﬁgure we've regenerated? MICHAEL: All of them, we're going to. RUDY: Yeah, well. At least we've restored part of her memory. MICHAEL: Yes. RUDY: Mixed blessings for you, right? If she remembers Steve and their life together, you'll probably lose her. MICHAEL: Yeah, but at least she'll be without some of the pain she's had. (BUZZER) Hi, there. Hi. Hi. How am I doing? You're gonna have to tell us. What's your name? Jaime SOMMERS. Do you know us? You're Rudy and you're Michael but I knew that before. Right. Let's try going back a little further. Where'd you go to school? Carnegie Tech. It was Carnegie Tech, Michael. I remember. What did you major in? Education. I was gonna be a teacher. I... I really remember this, Michael. Okay. Easy now. Let's try another area. Do you remember Steve? Oh, my bionic friend. What do you remember about him? Um, he's bionic. He's cute. What else do you remember about Steve? Oh... we grew up together. At least I think we did. Yes, you did. Jaime, do you remember your sky diving accident? Sky diving. I don't think I've ever been sky diving in my life, have I? Yes, you have. RUDY(VO): We've gotta do some more testing, Michael... to determine exactly what she can remember. You rest now. Goodbye, Jaime. Oh. JAIME: London. RUDY: Good. If you have any pain, you tell us right away. Stop worrying about me. All right. Watch the screen. Okay. (PROJECTOR CLICKS) JAIME: That's Wimbledon. (PROJECTOR CLICKS) Ahem. That's Oscar. (PROJECTOR CLICKS) That's Carnegie Tech. That's where I studied teaching. That looks famil... oh, that's Ojai. (PROJECTOR CLICKS) Oh, that's my parents! That's right. Do you remember them? Mmm-hmm. Uh... There was an auto accident and they died. I was sixteen, I think. Yes. Do you wanna stop now? JAIME: No, I'm okay. Let's go on. That's Steve's mom and dad, and I do know them. They became my legal guardians after that. JAIME: That's Forest Hills. Steve. Wait a minute. You know, I remember running in the rain... and Steve finding me, and I remember how it hurt. I remember that. Does it hurt now? Mmm. No, not now. That's good. Very good. Can't we do some more? Nope. Not yet. It's too soon. We've gotta do some more testing on your bionics anyway. I would really like to continue working on my memory. Jaime, we wanna move slowly and carefully this time. We don't wanna rush and overload you again. You guys are afraid that I'm gonna blow another fuse, aren't you? Bingo. All right. I can take a hint. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (BIONIC EAR SOUND EFFECT) MICHAEL: Jaime, if you can hear me, come on in. (BIONIC SOUND EFFECT) I heard you clear as a bell from half a mile away. Hi. Oh, Michael, it is so wonderful. There are so many little things that are coming back to me. About my parents and my childhood. And no pain? No. Not yet. I'm glad. RUDY: All right. Your fourth grade teacher. (BRITISH ACCENT) Oh, well, uh, that was Mrs. Langford. (LAUGHS) Who'd you beat last year at Forest Hills? Uh, Chris Everett. No, it wasn't Chrissie. It was Billie Jean King, that's who it was. Now... describe the plane you jumped from when you had your sky diving accident. I'm sorry, but there is absolutely nothing there. Well, that makes it pretty clear. Your memory decreases as we get closer to the accident that caused your bionics. And then just sporadic flashes of memory after the accident. Well, partial memory's better than no memory at all. I mean, at least I don't have that pain any more. Well, I will simply have to take the life... and the limbs that you two gave me... and take one day at a time. And I am thankful for that. I truly am. To both of you. So that wouldn't happen to be about me, would it? May I read it now? Yeah, well, since we've apparently broken the pain barrier... at least for the time being... I guess you're entitled to find out a little more about... who Jaime SOMMERS was. Was? What is wa... Is, thank you. Is. Okay. Don't get up, gentlemen. Was everything in that file? No. I left out the announcement about Steve and her engagement. I just don't know the right way to tell her about that. Yeah. (CROWD CHEERING) So that's how the pros do it, eh? Hi! I didn't even see you come in. Well, I'm a quiet man. Good to see you. Thank you. You look good. Thank you. I understand you've been looking over your file. Yes, that I have. A lot of the things I remember... but some of them are still pretty hazy. Well, the past always will seem a little mysterious to you. What about the present, huh? What are you gonna do? Wanna go back on the old tennis circuit? I don't think so. I don't think it would hardly be fair. I mean, I don't think even Jimmy Connors could return this serve. (BIONIC SOUND EFFECT) (TWANG) Wow! I see what you mean. What then? What're you gonna do? Well, before I became a tennis pro... I got a degree in education. And I always planned on being a teacher, so I... What I would really like to do... is go back to Ojai... put down some roots and maybe find some old ones... and try teaching again. Uh-huh. Sounds wonderful. Good for me, but what about for you? Me? What do you mean "me"? Well, I gotta think about your needs too, Oscar. I mean you got a pretty big investment in your bionic woman here, kiddo. I probably cost as much as Steve did. Well, not quite six million. I mean, your parts were smaller. Come on, Oscar. You know what I mean. I owe you my life. And I'm not gonna forget that. And whenever the O.S.I. needs something done, I intend to help. Jaime, after all you've been through... I think you deserve a life of your own. Well, I can do that too. I just wanna help you. No. No. The answer is no. It's over. What is this? Am I talking to Oscar Goldman? I mean, you're supposed to be cold blooded, a bureaucrat... Uh... Why don't you give yourself a break and let me work for you, huh? Okay, I'll tell you what. When you get settled up in Ojai, we'll decide then. Oscar... if I don't get an assignment from you very soon... I'm just gonna show up and I'm gonna kick your door down. Ah, you're just the one that can do it. And don't you forget it. Let's see now. Now do you need some reservations? Plane reservations to Ojai? Anything? Nope. Called my own private pilot and he's on his way. Oh? Steve? No, no. Steve's dad. Tell me one thing... how much does she know about herself and Steve. Well, just that they were kids, they grew up together. That's all. We haven't decided yet... how to tell Jaime about Steve and their plans for marriage. Why don't you let us do it? Me and Steve's mother, once Jaime's in Ojai and settled a bit. Good idea. Jim, I want to thank you very much for everything. My pleasure. Don't worry. We'll take care of everything. Thank you. There she is. Hi. Hi. Now you guys, you take care of yourselves, okay? RUDY: Don't worry. We'll be all right. All right, bye-bye. Good bye. You'll always be in my heart, Michael, you know that? Go ahead. She's just taking off. I checked the flight plan and they're headed for Ojai, California. Excellent. Now you know what to do? Right. I'll be in touch with you from Ojai. Well, next stop, Ojai. (HONKS TWICE) Oh! Jaime! Hi. Welcome home! Oh, thank you. We were so happy when you called us. Well, you and Jim are truly my clearest memory. What about Steve? That's a rough one. There's still so many pieces missing there. Well, maybe it'll come back in time. Maybe. But this place. I don't remember much about it. Did I come here a lot? No. We just bought it three months ago. Oh, you could've fooled me, you know. Come on, oh, honey? I'm going to show her the place. Good. Jim and I are finally going to take the time to do some travelling. So we won't be here a lot. We've always wanted to raise horses... (HORSES NEIGH) and when this ranch came on the market, we couldn't resist it. You know, it's going to be a great place to come home to. We think so. I sure hope I can find a place in town that I really like. That's part of the reason I brought you out here. Look there. HELEN: That barn has an apartment over it. (HORSES NEIGH) At least the health department might call it that if it were all fixed up. Oh, it's a mess, it's dirty, full of junk. But with your bionics, it should be a breeze. It's yours if you want it. Well, I don't even feel like I could just come in here and... Oh now, Jaime, if you really remember... what you feel about us, there's something else you should remember. We're a family. It's so good to be home. It's good to have you home again. Well, what do you say? It seems to me like you got yourself a tenant. (WHISTLING THROUGH AIR) (BIONIC SOUND EFFECT) Hey, here's a card from Steve in Rome. Here, you better read it. My arms are getting too short. "Dear Mom and Dad, Rome is beautiful, the people are fun... "the food is good, but I still like mom's 'pasghetti' better. "Be home soon, give Jaime my love. Steve." "Pasghetti?" That's what he used to call my spaghetti when he was a little boy. Is that a scrapbook on Steve? HELEN: Mmm-hmm. Can I look at it? Well... Maybe it'll help me remember. You know. Go ahead. That's Steve? HELEN: He started out sort of pudgy, didn't he? Nah, he's cute. It's okay. JAIME: Look at that. Oh, that's Steve with his first fish. HELEN: There's one of you. JAIME: I remember this. There, the two of you together. How much do you remember? Well, you know, it's strange. I look at some of these pictures and I remember them. And yet other ones I look at, and, uh... I don't know, I feel warm... but it's still like I'm looking at somebody else. JAIME: Oh, my graduation. Look at those shoes! Ugh. What's wrong? There's something you need to know before you turn the page. You and Steve were much closer than you remember, Jaime. Next page may be painful for you. What is thi...? We were gonna be marr...? Mmm-hmm. Married, I don't... Steve and I were gonna be married? That's right. Do you remember anything? JIM: Anything at all? Is it painful for you? Are you feeling any pain? Jaime? No, there's no pain, it's ju... It's just... It's just so hard to believe... I can't understand how I... I get... I get these little wisps of memory... but it just feels like there's something missing and I can't... What is it? I don't know. I just don't know what it is. (LAUGHS) Think it'll do? Looks, great. Where'd you find it? At a used appliance store in town. Seems to work okay. Here, let me get off the truck and ease her down. No, no, that's okay. (BIONIC SOUND EFFECT) You know, it really knocks me out... to see you do things like that. I'll tell you something. It's a little secret because it actually impresses me, too. You and Steve really are something. Hey, don't worry it about it, Dad. It's okay. I'm thinking a little bit about him myself these days. (PHONE RINGS) Hey! First phone call on my new phone. Be right back. (PHONE RINGS) Hello? Jaime? Any luck with that school up in Ojai? No, I struck out. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. But you know, I think I've got something for you. At the Air Force Base school? OSCAR: Right. They got one teaching position left. Well, that's all I need. Okay, who do I talk to? You talk to Lt. Col. Tom Holloway, Deputy Base Commander. He's awaiting your call. Okay. That's great. I, um... I talked with Helen last night. I understand that you learned a few new things. Yes, I did. I've got somebody here, a friend of yours. He wants to talk with you. Hold on. Hi. Uh, Steve? Hi. How you doing? Pretty good. How's Mom and Dad? They're fine. Are you gonna be coming out this way soon? Yeah, in a couple of days. I'm on my way to Thailand. You think we could spend some time together? There's a lot of things I'd like to talk to you about. Sure. Good, I'll see you soon then, huh? Yeah. Bye . Good bye. Hi, I'm Jaime SOMMERS and I'm gonna see... Lt. Col. Tom Holloway at the base school. Oscar Goldman had a lot of nice things to say about you, Jaime. Oh, he's sweet. As a matter of fact, I've been a fan of yours myself. Saw you play last year at Forest Hills. You wanna tell me why you've decided to go back to teaching? Well, after my sky diving accident, I wasn't quite the same... so I just decided to settle down. Sorry to hear that. I'm afraid you're not going to be able to do much settling with your class. You see I only have one position open... and it's not exactly the easiest. As a matter of fact... they've managed to chew up four substitutes in three months. Oooh. Sounds like it's going to be a challenge. Yeah. It's a class comprised of sixth, seventh and eighth graders. The kids of our service personnel. They travel a lot, which adds to the learning process... but unfortunately, they spend most of their time... adjusting to new schools, teachers, friends. I think quite a few of them have tough disciplinarian fathers. That sort of thing. It's not gonna be easy. I hope you've got a couple of good, solid legs to stand on. Well, as a matter of fact, I do. Good. Can you start tomorrow? Oh, you bet! Where can I pick up the books? Come on, I'll show you. And how 'bout a little tennis sometime? Uh, sure. Hey, good. All right. (KNOCKING) HELEN: Anybody home? Just us schoolteachers. Oh, so glad about your new job. Have you met your class yet? No. Apparently, there's something you have to brace yourself for. You can handle them. Why don't you have dinner with us tonight? No, thanks. I'm gonna whip up a little tuna salad... and I've gotta studying to do. Hmm-mmm? Don't think I have a can opener. Oh, I'll get you one at the house. No, no, no. It's okay. I mean, what are fingernails for, you know? (BIONIC SOUND EFFECT) (CAN OPENER GRINDING) (HELEN LAUGHS) Incredible. You don't happen to have an extra set of those nails, do you? No, but I'll have Rudy check the parts department for you... see what he'll come up with. Good. I brought over some old pictures I've found for you to look at. Okay, I will. Thanks. It isn't easy, is it? No, it's not. How does it feel? I look at those pictures and I see somebody that looks like me... and sometimes I even remember bits and pieces... but mostly it's in my head and not in my heart. Especially when it comes to Steve. Can I, uh, say something just between you and I, Helen? Sure. I care an awful lot about Steve. But I just don't know where my heart is. I understand. It's so frustrating to be confused. It really is. Well, there's one thing not to be confused about. I almost had you for my daughter-in-law and nothing could've made me happier. But back when you were growing up... even before you lost your parents I always thought of you as my daughter. And I always will, Jaime. So you see, I win either way. Hi, Jaime? Hi. Welcome aboard. I'm Karen Stone. Hi, Karen Stone. You know, I was new here last year. But now I'm an old hag. So you need any help at all, just give me a holler. Thank you. Uh, and it might be sooner than you think. You know they gave you the dirty dozen. I know. Are they really as bad as they said? Not really. They're just into pre-adolescence. So they're a little more outspoken than some of the other classes. And of course, you're the new teacher, so you just gotta be put through the mill. Of course. (KIDS CHATTER) Shh! Be quiet! (SCHOOL BELL RINGS) My class is starting. Bye-bye. Good bye. (KIDS GIGGLING) Come on, you guys. Sit up straight. Let's go. Good morning. I'm Miss SOMMERS. We know you. Well, good. Umm... I'll get to know your names as quickly as I can. You had to quit tennis, huh? (KIDS GIGGLE) Yeah, but that's a long story. I'll tell you about it sometime. Now! don't know what kind of a routine you're used to... but I've written my plans for the classroom organization on the board... (KIDS GIGGLING) Well, I thought I wrote it on the board. Just one moment, please. (FAST SCRAPING) How'd you do that so fast? All right, I would like each of you to copy off the section that applies to you. You see, I've got sixth, seventh and eighth... (LOUD SNAP) Who did that? Nobody did that, huh? (KIDS LAUGHING) Would you please hand me that telephone book? Thank you. I guess you know what a rotten reputation this class has. (KIDS LAUGHING) The other teachers have all sorts of terrific little names for you. Guess you can be a pretty rough and rowdy bunch, huh? (KIDS LAUGHING) That's okay. I don't mind that. 'Cause it just shows me you've got a lot of spirit and I like that. However... I am not just another substitute. I am here to stay. And if we're gonna get along, you're gonna learn a little bit about respect. Now some teachers feel that the best way to get respect from their students... is to threaten them. (PAPER TEARING) I don't like to make threats, because most of the time... they're not really carried out, you know? And I've always felt... that the best way of teaching was the gentle approach. (LOUD RIPPING) I feel that respect for a teacher should grow naturally. Through friendship and some trust. And I expect you to be able to develop and understand all this... and have that kind of respect for me. (LOUD TEARING) (BIONIC EAR SOUND EFFECT) Boy, this broad is spooky. Yeah, I know. I'll make you a deal. I won't call you a sewer sprat, and you don't call me a "broad." Wow. How'd she hear that? I have very good hearing. All right, let's break up the regimentation here a little bit. I want everybody to move their desks in a circle... so we can all see each other a little better. Now once we get the desks moved... I want each of you to write an autobiography... because I wanna know everything there is to know about each and every one of you. So think about that while you're moving your desks. Come on, move it. (CLAPS HANDS) Get going. Whoo! Jaime, how was your first day? Oh, it was fun. I'm sure you did fine. Listen, the control tower called my office. Colonel Austin radioed that he's over San Antonio. He'll be landing here in about an hour and a half. Okay, um, good. I'll come back and meet him. Say are you two, um... I don't know, Tom. That's okay, I'm just checking. Bye- bye . (REVS ENGINE) (TIRES SQUEALING) (TIRES SCREECH) No! It's gonna explode! MAN: It's gonna explode! My leg! Can't move my leg! (BIONIC SOUND EFFECT) Can you walk? I don't... The pain. Don't move me. All right, then I'm gonna go for help. Okay? Okay. I'll be back. Okay. (SIRENS WAIL) Down this way here. Oh, now he's around... Was right... Look, uh, are you sure this is where you left him? I mean there's nobody out here. Well, he was right here. Well, maybe somebody beat us back here and took him to the hospital. No, the guy couldn't even move! Okay, lady, then where is he? I don't know where he is. MAN: You wouldn't believe what she did to get me out of that car after Johnny hit me. HARRIS: Good. Yes, Miss SOMMERS is quite a unique young woman. I think it's time I went to Ojai. We have quite a few surprises in store for her. No, Oscar, it was the strangest thing. They still haven't found a trace of him. Jaime, I'll look into it. And let me know if anything else happens that's unusual, huh? Okay, um, I gotta run now, Oscar. 'Cause Steve's plane is landing. So, I'll see you soon. Okay. Bye-bye. (TIRES SCREECH) Hello, Vaughn. Oh, it's so good to be back in Ojai. Even though you don't remember all of it? Oh, yeah. Even then. You know I got to see your mom's old scrapbook. We really did grow up together. Yeah. Do you remember any of it? Boy, I've been trying real hard. How did you and I first meet? Well, it was my first day in the third grade. You dared me to eat one of everything in the cafeteria. Did I? Did you? Yeah, I tried. I got pretty sick. I got even with you right here on this swing. Yeah, what'd you do? Stick a frog down my back? No, it was a lizard. Eww. That's an awful thing to do. (BIONIC SOUND EFFECT) (PLANE ENGINES) (CHIMES) Why did you hide this from me? I was afraid it might bring back your memories. And your pain. Does it? No. Not anymore. What we were to each other, and our engagement. You know about that? Yeah. It must've been so awful for you trying to keep all that bottled up inside of you. I really appreciate everything you have done for me, Steve. And I appreciate... what we must've shared. But I don't feel those feelings now. I can't remember what it was like to be in love with you. I understand. I mean, knowing you now, I can understand how we got to be so close. And maybe in time we can be that close again. I guess what I'm trying to ask you is if this can be a whole new beginning for us. How long will you be in Thailand? Just until I can convince Oscar that the mission's completed. It won't be long if! know your son, Helen. Well, the sooner he's home again, the better we'll all like it. Bye, son. Goodbye, Dad. Goodbye, dear. Goodbye, Mom. Are you coming, Oscar? I'll be along. I've got a little business here, Steve. STEVE: Okay. (CAR DOOR SLAMS) You will come home and see me, won't you? You can count on it. (STARTS ENGINE) We'll join you in a minute. I wanna talk with you. What's wrong, Oscar? Well, I'm a little concerned about something, Jaime. I can see that. What is it? Jaime... it might be dangerous for you living here in Ojai. Dangerous? What are you talking about? The accident. That accident that you just saw. It may not have been an accident. Someone may be trying to kill you. Me? Uh... Who? We don't know. But we think it might be safer for you to be away from here. Jaime, I want you to plan on... Oscar! Wait a minute. I came back to Ojai... to put down some roots and to teach and to make my life. Now I can't run away from all that just because you're suspicious. All right, let me ask you something. Say there's another accident, only this time, you're in the middle of it. Do you think you can handle it? Yes. It's easy to say, huh? I can't leave here, Oscar. Sooner or later, I'm gonna have to make a stand for myself... and I may as well do it right now. I'll be in in a minute. Don't worry. (END THEME MUSIC)
