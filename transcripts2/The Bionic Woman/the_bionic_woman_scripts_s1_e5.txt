 Okay gang. Show and tell. Katie, you want to come on up? Come on. (SIGHS) Tell the class what you've brought. Don't be shy. Aw, not Katie. Her stuff's always so dull. (SNARLING) (CHILDREN EXCLAIMING) (CHILDREN CHATTERING) JAIME: All right, now don't anybody panic. Stay absolutely still. (LION SNARLING) Neil, stop! Lie down.

 Katie, would you like to introduce your guest to the class. Sure. This is my friend... Neil. And this is Susan Victor. This is Neil's owner and trainer. Hello, everybody. CHILDREN: Hello. Are you the trainer that bought the old Haley ranch? Yes. Wow. My dad really got bent out of shape when he heard there were wild animals right over the hill. Katie, why don't you tell the class about Susan's wild animals? Well, all of Susan's animals are tame. She uses a technique called affection training to teach many of the animals you see on TV and in the movies. Hey, did you train the shark? No. All of my animals are the four-legged kind.

 Two years ago, Neil almost had to be put away. You mean they almost killed him? Neil was too wild to fit into the circus. Every time he heard a trainer's gunshot, he'd panic and start to attack. That's when Susan took him in and started giving him lots of love and affection. With the help of my great assistant, Katie. Katie... Really? That's right. Wow! Can I... Is it safe to pet him? Oh, yes. In fact, he'd probably love it. Especially behind the ears. Okay, now, everybody, move very slowly and quietly. You can all pet him. Everybody move slow. (CHILDREN EXCLAIMING) You were right, Jaime. Katie certainly isn't shy any longer. I know. This has been so good for her. Hmm. It was really nice of you to let her bring him to class. And look at his feet, aren't they huge? CHILDREN: Yeah, wow! BILL: Must've been a really big cat that killed your steer. KEYS: Yeah, suspicious. Look at that track. That's impossible. Hasn't been a cougar in this valley in years. I didn't say it was a cougar. That track's bigger than any cougar's I've seen. Big as a lion, maybe. Only one lion around here. Billy! Billy! Come on! Billy! Billy! SUSAN: Come on. That a good guy. Come on, Tusker. Move it up. You okay? Oh, it's fantastic. Fantastic. Easy. Leans over and everything. Okay. JAIME: Gosh, I wish I could bring my class out here. That's terrific. SUSAN: They're welcome anytime. All of them? You want all them here? Oh, sure. Hey, Jaime, that would help me out a lot. Maybe people would accept this place then and try to understand what I'm trying to do. You're having problems? Oh, yeah. One neighbor called and said that his dairy cows were drying up because of old Neil's roars. And another neighbor said that he'd shoot any animals that trespassed his land... Oh, that's... Just a lot of nice neighborly... (GASPS) My God, Jaime! Your foot! Tusker! Back up! If it's broken... Jaime, are you all right? Uh, no, it's fine. It's really okay. Do you know how much weight he had on it? Oh, Jaime, your foot should be crushed. Oh, well he obviously didn't put all his weight on it. It's really... Are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay. I've just got a lot in my mind. Katie, can you come here a minute, honey? Yeah. Listen, after you've finished all your chores, will you give Tusker an extra load of hay and all the water he can drink? Okay. Okay? Thanks, love. JAIME: Katie must really be a big help, huh? Oh, she's just a super kid. I don't know if I could manage without her. Hey, Katie has told me that you had to let go of a really good assistant that you had. Yeah, I just couldn't pay him anymore. And I haven't paid Katie and I haven't paid the feed bill in over a month. (CHUCKLES) It's laughable. They're eating prime rib, and I'm working for peanuts. Now don't you start feeling sorry for yourself. Susan, you're good, and it's gonna change. (NEIL ROARING) Hi, Neil. Come here. How's my good guy? Hi, sweetheart. Hello, my love. How are you? You know, I'm waiting for a call right now. He's a TV producer, wants to do a show about a girl lost in the wilds of Africa. Oh, that's perfect for you. Uh... I've been waiting for too many calls to get my hopes up. (PHONE RINGING) My hopes are up. Come on. Good. Hello. Yes, this is Susan Victor. Oh, really? Well, yes, yes, of course. You want me to come to New York tonight? Uh... Could you hold on please? What'll I do? What do you mean, what'll you do? Have you got it? Well, I don't know. It looks good, but I can't just pick up and go to New York. Why not? Well, what do I do about the animals? Oh, I can take care of them. Tomorrow's Saturday. You? Well, of course, me. Katie and I can do it together. Listen, what we can do is, we can lock up all the animals... Except Neil. Okay. Except Neil. And... Oh, don't mess up your chance! Do... Go for it! Okay. Okay. Yes. Yes, I'll be there. Thank you. Okay, bye. Fantastic. Congratulations. Thank you. What you doing, kiddo? (KATIE EXCLAIMS) You know, Susan ought to be over Ohio right about now. Gee, I sure hope she gets that show. She loves these animals so much. I know. And she's not the only one around here who does. Yeah, me, too. (NEIL ROARS) Just look at that. That's what I love about this place. A big cat like Neil can roam around free and not be caged up. Boy, it sure is fun to watch, but it takes so much getting used to. Sure does. What's next? Well, I got to put a new diaper on the chimp, but I've gotta get this feed sack inside the barn first. It's so heavy. Susan and I couldn't lift it yesterday. Well, I'll tell you what, if you go diaper the chimp, I'll move the bags in the barn for you. How's that? Gladly. Okay. Bye! Bye. (BIONIC POWERS ACTIVATING) (NEIL ROARING) (TRUMPETING) Hey, what's the matter, fella? JAIME: Neil... Neil, calm down. (TRUMPETING LOUDLY) Get back, Tusker! Easy, Tusker. (BIONIC POWERS ACTIVATING) (BIONIC POWERS ACTIVATING) What happened? I don't know. Neil jumped down and he spooked Tusker. I think it's my fault. With Susan leaving, I forgot to feed him. Well, that might be the answer. I mean, all the affection in the world isn't gonna stop a hungry animal. Okay, Tusker. Chow time! It's okay. It's okay. (NEIL ROARS) (CAR HONKING) Uncle Bill! How are you? Good. You know her? Oh, sure. This is Jaime Sommers. This is Charlie Keys. How do you do? Jaime here is my brother Jim's stepdaughter. She lives over at his place. But what are you doing here? Oh, I'm zoo-sitting. Isn't Susan Victor around? No. She went to New York for the weekend. Can I help you? (SNARLING) Doesn't she keep that lion locked up? Now don't worry about it. He's not gonna hurt you. Come here, Neil. Keep him out of here! Keep him out of here! Now, that is the one thing you don't want to do. Guns upset him a lot. Now it's all right, I'm holding him. He'll break away from you anytime he wants to. I'm not having any trouble holding him. I've heard about that lion's reputation. How that circus dumped him because he was so vicious. It's because people were around him with guns. Now will you please put that gun down? (GROWLS) You see how uppity he is? Why did you come here? We found a steer torn to pieces on my ranch, about three miles over the hill. I'm sorry to hear that. But why did you come here? That steer had been killed by a cat, Jaime. It was killed by that lion. Oh, come on. Neil's a pet. KEYS: He's wild. He has no right to be here. Now look, Jaime, please try to understand. It's taken over 20 years to control the cougars in this valley, and now some woman moves in with an animal that's twice as deadly. Mr. Keys, Susan's animals, all of them, are under control. Are you sure about that, Jaime? Look, I wasn't here last night so I can't defend Neil, but I'm sure that when Susan comes back... Listen to me. I want him caged and chained. I cannot do that. Neil isn't used to being chained. I'm telling you, you better keep him put away or I'm just gonna have to come back here with the sheriff. You ready to go, Bill? Yeah. Better do as he says, Jaime. I'll phone you tonight. And I'll tell you one more thing, I find him on my property, I'm gonna shoot him. Come on, Neil. Lie down. Neil didn't do it! He couldn't have. I believe you, honey. And I believe in Susan's training methods, too. Did Susan ever mention to you... About seeing any other kind of a cat around here? A cougar or a mountain lion? Hmm... No. Well, there's gotta be some kind of a dangerous animal around here. What does she use this for? That's not a regular gun. You see, it shoots this tranquilizer dart. She has some more out in the barn in case of... In case of an emergency. Katie, are you telling me that Susan has had trouble with her stock? There's never been a problem. And there won't be. As long as the animals know you care for 'em. Please don't put Neil in a cage, Jaime. I'm not going to. But I am gonna keep him inside with me tonight. (CHATTERING) (SQUAWKING) Come on, you guys. (SQUAWKING) (ANIMALS SCREECHING) Oscar, I hope you never send me on a safari. (GROWLING IN THE DISTANCE) (ANIMALS SCREECHING) (NEIL GROWLING) (NEIL ROARING) (BIONIC POWERS ACTIVATING) Oops! Morning, Sheriff. Mr. Keys. Good morning. Jaime, how are you? Okay. Look, I hate to bother you, but... Why don't you just get to the point, Sheriff? Well, Mr. Keys lost another steer last night. It was killed by a cat. Now look over there, Sheriff. You see? They let that lion run loose all the time. That lion is as tame as a house cat. Why don't you just ask her where that lion was last night? He was in the house with me. Just as he is every night when Susan's here. All night? Are you sure? What can I tell you? When I went to sleep he was there, and when I woke up he was there. No traces of blood on him? Look for yourself. Well, she could've cleaned that up. Oh, come on! Say, I've lost almost $1,200 worth of prime beef. And you still can't prove it was Neil that did it. Once a killer always a killer. Now listen, I'm gonna get a court order if! Have to! All right, just calm down. Both of you. Jaime, I want you to lock him up for a few days. Now if there're any more attacks, we'll know it's not your lion. Okay. Neil's never been penned up before. Oh, it won't be for long. How could you let them do it? Honey, I had no choice. And besides, it'll give Keys a chance to cool off. And the sheriff's right. It'll prove that Neil is innocent. Of course he is. Honey, you know him and you love him. But to most people a lion is a wild animal. You don't think he did it? Oh, no. And besides, any animal that gets as much meat as Susan feeds Neil certainly doesn't need to hunt for more. KATIE: That's right. What is this? Well, see, when Susan started running low on money we had to cut Neil's meat ration. So now he gets half soybean meal. It's all protein, right? Yeah. That's right. You wouldn't hurt anybody. You're a sweet babe. (PHONE RINGING) Thank you. Hello. Hi, Jaime. It's Uncle Bill. Hi. I was just wondering how you were doing. Why? Are you afraid the big bad lion has gotten to me? No, no. I'm just keeping an eye on you. It's a hard habit to break, honey. Remember, our family's been doing that since you were 12 years old. With Helen and Jim out of town, it, sort of, falls to me. I know. I'm sorry, Bill. Everything's fine. Good. Menagerie all locked up? All locked up and bedded down. The lion, too? Yep. Good. Now you keep a close guard on him, and keep him under wraps. Bill, it sounds to me like you're actually on their side. Let's just say I want everybody to be safe, honey. All right. Goodbye. KATIE: Neil! Neil come back here! Jaime, help! (TUSKER TRUMPETING) Katie? Are you all right? He's gone. Well, what happened? I couldn't stand seeing him locked up like that. So you let him out of the cage? I just wanted to play with him for a minute. Oh, Katie. I wanted to see him run around like always. Then, all of a sudden, he growled and got up, like he was listening to something. Then he ran out. I tried to stop him. Really. It's all right, honey. Which way did he go? Do you know? Towards Uncle Bill's place. What are we gonna do? I'm gonna go find Neil before anyone else does, and you call Bill and tell him that Neil's headed towards him, all right? Okay. Okay. Okay. It'll be fine. Don't worry about it. (NEIL ROARING) (BIONIC POWERS ACTIVATING) (NEIL ROARING) Neil? (SNARLING) Neil, is that you? Hey, come on out here 'cause I'm getting really scared. (GROWLING) Neil? Come on. Come on. Okay. You ready to go home? Huh? You ready to go home? All right. Well, if you're ready, let's go. Come on. (LEAVES RUSTLING) Come on. Let's go home. Neil! (ROARS) (LEAVES RUSTLING) KATIE: Can I stay? Please? Katie, in view of the way Neil's been acting, I really think it's best that you go home. (SIGHS) Neil wouldn't hurt anyone. Honey, I don't think he would either, and I'm gonna try and find out one way or the other tonight. Okay? Okay. Thanks, Pete. Thanks. (ENGINE STARTS) (SNARLS) What do you hear, Neil? What... (GROWLING) (ROARING) No! (BIONIC POWERS ACTIVATING) (SIGHS) It is a cougar. KEYS: And you're the only one that's seen it. If it's true. If it's true! Jaime, even if there is a cougar, Neil was out there, too. And he killed another one of my Herefords. That's three I've lost. I brought Neil home last night. He was out there long enough. It could have been Neil, Jaime. Bill, I saw a cougar. Now, look, Jaime, I appreciate what you're trying to do for your girlfriend, but it's just not gonna work any longer. The only way to end this whole thing is to kill the real attacker. Mr. Keys, I couldn't agree with you more. Where are you going, Jaime? There is a cougar out there, and I'm gonna find him. (CLICKING TONGUE) Hey, Bill, I can't afford to lose any more stock. I'm just gonna have to get a court order and have that animal destroyed. You gonna come? No. I'm going with Jaime. Let's go. (TIRES SCREECHING) Why are we stopping? Ah, a court order will take too long. Now we've been fooling around with that lion long enough. What are you talking about? We're going back to that barn, we're gonna finish off that lion right now. Whoa. Whoa! Bill, what are you doing here? Uh... Jim and Helen would never forgive me if anything happened to you, honey. Well, I'm glad you came. Good. Let's see if we can find some answers. BILL: I think he's headed north. Must be a little Indian in you there, Bill. Just a little. Whoa! Oh, no. No. No. He belongs to that lady, as long as he's on this property. Hey, and I'm not looking to get sued. We're gonna turn him loose and we'll get him when he gets to my land. We'll have every right to shoot him. All right. Open that cage. I've never been close to a lion before. He's a beautiful animal. Come on. Come on. They're gonna be back any time. Turn him loose. (GROWLS) Give him a push. Not me. (SNARLING) (SIGHS) (YELLS) All right. Let's wake him up. (RIFLE FIRES) There he goes! (GROWLING) We better stick with him. We don't want him to get too far ahead. KEYS: Okay, he's off her land. Let's try to get a shot at him. Where'd he go? Just came over this rise. He can't be too far. Where is he? Do you see him? I think we lost him. He must be up in the hills somewhere. Or headed toward town. If he is, we're in a lot of trouble. Yeah. All right, you go on after him up there. I'm gonna double back to town. All right. (GROWLING) (ROARING) (URGING HORSE) What is it, Jaime? I thought I heard a cat. Oh? Where? It's over there. Come on. Whoa! (GROWLING) He's gotta be right over there. Well, we can never cross here. Maybe if we went downstream, a ways. Tell you what, Bill. You go down there and go across and I'm gonna try to get around these rocks and we can maybe close in on him, huh? Okay. (BIONIC POWERS ACTIVATING) (GROWLING) JAIME: Bill! (BIONIC POWERS ACTIVATING) (WHIMPERING) Bill, are you all right? Can you stand up? Yeah. I'm okay. Are you okay? You know, it was a cougar. Yeah. The biggest one I ever saw. How'd you do that to him? What happened? I heard a shot. The cat jumped him. RANCHER: That lion is a killer. There's your lion. RANCHER: A cougar? Neil's been locked up all day. No, we let the lion go. You what? Well, it was Keys' idea to turn it loose so we could shoot it and kill it. Oh, my God! If they start shooting at Neil, he's gonna go crazy! You two, if you can tie up the cougar, I'm gonna go find Neil. All right? Yeah. All right. Just be careful. (RIFLE FIRES) (BIONIC POWERS ACTIVATING) (CAR APPROACHING) Hey, Charlie. Aren't you hunting a little out of season? No, there's a lion loose. A lion? It's the same one that's been killing our stock. You got a citizen band in there? Yeah. Okay, get on it. Now you spread the word. I'm gonna follow him up through there. You got it. Willy, that's the lion that's been killing our steers. Now get your gun. Come on! (RIFLE FIRES) I think I winged him. He's headed for the old Bennett place. I got a bunch of boys headed this way. Give 'em this location. Right. This is Mason. Lion's headed for the old Bennett place. KEYS: Yeah, he's hit, okay. Yeah, and he's in there. What you gonna do? (NEIL SNARLING) I'm gonna go in and finish him. You're crazy! I've hunted him this far. Yeah, but that was out in the open. Now he's trapped and he's wounded. I'm telling you, you're crazy to go in there. No! No, put your guns down! KEYS: All right, he's wounded. Keep your guns straight on that door. KATIE: No! Don't shoot him! Hey, I know how we can get him. We'll toss some flares in the old barn and start a fire. Hey, that's great. All right. We'll shoot him on the way out. You can't shoot him! Somebody get this kid out of here! Katie. Jaime, they're gonna shoot Neil! No, they're not, honey. Stay right here. KATIE: Don't shoot him! Excuse me. Hey, lady, stand back. Let me through! Listen to me, Keys! It was a cougar that was killing your stock. I've heard that story before. I've got the living proof. Bill's got him tied up in the hills. You'd say anything to keep the lion alive. Oh! No, wait, please. Hold it! We're gonna smoke him out. Mr. Keys, please let me go in there. Neil knows me. I can handle him. What happened? It was a cougar, Charlie. That's what's been doing in your stock. Yeah. It's true. It wasn't the lion. How can we be sure? It could have been that lion, too. Oh, you just won't quit! KEYS: Okay. Okay. Maybe you're right. I'll admit I was wrong about that cougar, but there's no getting near the lion now. He's been wounded. He's wounded? We'd better finish him. You're not gonna finish him! I'm sorry, Jaime. Best thing is to chase him out here and destroy him. (NEIL GROWLING) All right, check your rifles. We're gonna throw in the flares. Let me go! Jaime, don't let 'em do it! Don't worry, honey. Bill! Everybody put your guns down. Get out of the way, Elgin. That lion's crazy now. Well, you'd be crazy, too, if somebody was shooting at you. Now listen, I told you to stay at the car. Now you go back! Bill? Bill! Put 'em down! I'm gonna go in now. Look, Jaime, I know there's something special about you, but are you sure this is something you can handle? I gotta try. Be careful, honey. No! Bill, don't let her do it! Just stay where you are! (NEIL ROARS) JAIME: Neil? Neil? It's me, fella. Hear they messed you up a little, huh? Neil, will you come on out? (ROARING) Neil! (GRUNTS) Neil! (BIONIC POWERS ACTIVATING) Oh, Jaime. Stay out! Neil, you are upset, aren't you, fella? Neil, I understand, man. It's not easy to be a nice guy when you're hurt and... Neil! (BIONIC POWERS ACTIVATING) Neil, we're not gonna get out of this if you don't calm down! That's a boy. Okay. That's a good boy. Now stay there. That's a boy. I'm just gonna take a look at where you're hurt. Okay? Okay. That's a good boy, Neil. Stay right where you are. Stop it! Neil, I'm trying to help you. Now just... That's a boy, Neil! Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Easy. Okay. Let me take a look at your foot there. Come on. (PANTING) Neil. Now I got a pretty good right arm here. If you're coming in for another bite, man, I'm gonna have to deck you. Oh. Oh, Neil! All right, just what is going on here? Jaime's in there with that lion. The lion's wounded and Elgin won't let us in. Come on, Bill, get out of the way. Jaime? Well, he's probably killed her, too! There's your killer. I'm sorry, Miss Sommers, about Neil and your arm. Oh, that's all right, honey. You were right anyway, you know. Everybody else had their doubts. By the way, I was very proud of the way you spoke up at the barn yesterday. Well, last night, I mean. Oh! Wasn't exactly shy old Katie, was I? No, you weren't. You were wonderful. Thanks. Hey, can we still bring the class out here? Oh, yeah. I think so. Good. What do you say, Neil? You want the kids to come out here? Hey. Neil! Where are you going? Come on. Hi, Neil. Listen, we got it! We got the show! We got it! You're gonna be a star! Is that true? Yeah. Congratulations! SUSAN: Oh! That's really nice. Okay. (GIGGLES) What's this? Come on, Jaime. Katie? You all haven't had any trouble, have you? (ANIMALS SCREECHING) (LAUGHS)
