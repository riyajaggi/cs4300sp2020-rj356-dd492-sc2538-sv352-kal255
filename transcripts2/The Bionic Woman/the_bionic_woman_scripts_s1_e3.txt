 Okay. Oh! Good morning, Mark. Did your car break down? Sorry, Miss Sommers. Current events. Let's see who read the morning paper today. 'Cause I didn't have time to. (WHISPERING) Quick. Give me a story. (WHISPERING) She'll hear. She can't hear this far. Come on. The murmurs of a volunteer are drifting this way. Mark, do you have a story? Uh, no, ma'am. No? Well, then I'd suggest you hide your teeth. Give you another chance on Monday. Anybody else? I got one.

 Okay, you're on. I heard about this story on TV this morning. A violent civil war's broken out in Costa Brava. That's a little South American country and a lot of United States citizens live there. And the last thing anybody knew was that our ambassador, a guy named, uh, Morehouse, was trying to get them out to safety. Uh, that was about all they said. Andrew, do you know what a civil war is? Yeah. It's uh, people from the same country fighting each other. How do you feel about that? Well, I don't know, Miss Sommers. It all seems so far away. (GUNS FIRING) (LOUD BANGING) (BANGING CONTINUES) I'm afraid we're trapped. Oh, God! Oh, God! All right. I can get to the radio. (CRYING) It's all right. It's all right. (RADIO BUZZING) This is US Ambassador Morehouse. Help, please. We're trapped underneath Vector Four Depot. Help, please. It's all right. This is Ambassador Morehouse. We need help, please. Won't someone come in, please? We need help. (WHISPERING) What's the answer to number three? (WHISPERING) Are you crazy? With her ears? Okay, kids, better wrap it up. Class is almost over. And I hope you studied a lot better for this one, 'cause the class average on the last test was really rotten. (PHONE RINGING) Hello? Oh, yeah. Put him through. (SCHOOL BELL RINGING) What, are you waiting for it to rain? Put your tests up here and go home. And have a really nice weekend. GIRL: Bye, Miss Sommers. Goodbye. Goodbye, Miss Sommers. Bye, Miss Sommers. Have a good weekend. Goodbye, Miss Sommers. STUDENTS: Bye, Miss Sommers. I hope I get a good grade. GIRL: Bye, Miss Sommers. I hope you get a good grade, too. Goodbye. (STUDENTS CHATTERING) Oscar! Hi! Where are you? OSCAR: Flying over eastern California. I should be in Ojai in about 15 minutes. Great! Are you gonna have time to see me? Time to see you? I'm coming to see you, sweetheart. You say you want assignments. Well, I've got one for you. A big one. [can use your help. Oh, uh, when? Right away. We're landing only long enough to pick you up. I'll brief you on the plane. Jaime? Jaime, are you there? (STUTTERS) Uh, yeah. Oh, that's fine. I'll see you then. OSCAR: All right. Bye. (INDISTINCT CHATTERING ON RADIO) OSCAR: Welcome aboard, Jaime. JAIME: Hey, tell me what's going on? OSCAR: In a minute. Right now, get strapped in. PILOT: This is Air Force niner-zero, requesting immediate takeoff. Clearance priority code Snow White. MAN IN TOWER: Roger, niner-zero. You've been cleared for takeoff. Well, Oscar, you sure do know how to sweep a girl off her feet. I'm sorry that this is so sudden, but we didn't have much time. Sweetheart, I want you to listen to this. MOREHOUSE: (ON TAPE) Vector Four Depot... Bombed... Help... (TAPE REWINDING) Listen again. MOREHOUSE: Help. Vector Four Depot. Bombed... That's our Ambassador, George Morehouse. In Costa Brava? OSCAR: Yes. He's alive, and I think he's hiding somewhere near Vector Four Depot. Now this is the clearest message we've been able to get. I had the Army radio back, but couldn't get through. I'd like you to hear this just once more. Wait a minute. What's the matter with this thing? It's not working. What? It won't rewind? No. Okay. (BIONIC POWERS ACTIVATING) There you go. Do you realize how much money we could make if I patented you as a household tool? (LAUGHS) Be a lot safer, too. Now what would you like me to do? MOREHOUSE: Help. Vector Four Depot. Bombed... When I think of you on paper, I think of you as an agent. But when I see you... I wonder if this might be too risky, Jaime. Oh, come on, Oscar, now you're not gonna back down now. I asked to go on missions. Now, what do you want me to do? It's a shot in the dark. If we send you in disguised as a nurse on a rescue team, the guerrillas might, I say might, just might respect the neutrality of your medical aid. They might not fire on you. What... What is it, Oscar? I want you to get George Morehouse out of there. It's risky, I know. If I send in the Army, then they'd say it's American military intervention. Now, if you want to get out of it, you don't want to do it, say so now. It's not too late. No, it's not that. It's not the mission. I'll do that. (STUTTERING) It's the part about being a nurse. Oscar, I can't even put on a Band-Aid. Oh, I don't think there'll be any doctoring, Jaime. Now, here's a uniform. (STAMMERS) Uh-huh. And a first aid manual. We'll be arriving in Costa Bravo in about two hours, and you'll have plenty of time to just, uh, cram until then. (CHUCKLES SARCASTICALLY) Well, let's hope that the teacher can cram a lot better than her kids. "How to stop arterial bleeding"? (STAMMERING) Oh, Oscar, I... (LAUGHING) You're gonna make it, pal. You're nuts. PILOT: Air Force niner-zero. Priority code Snow White crossing Sao Paulo checkpoint. Do you read me, Salvador Tower? MAN: Roger, niner-zero. This is Salvador Tower. Air lane clear for your approach. That's what I call a friendly welcome. We're on our way in. Your pilot just radioed. He'll be here in a minute. (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) I hope he's a doctor, too. He's a civilian. Works for special missions. He doesn't know anything about your bionics. He thinks you're a medic. Well, why do you use him? (HELICOPTER APPROACHING) You are just about to find out, Jaime. Is that my pilot? His name is Jack Starkey and he's the finest helicopter pilot alive. Yeah? Who says? He says. Oh, good. (THUDDING) It's a nice landing. Yeah. You with the 08!? Yes. Are you the medic I'm supposed to pick up? No. A nurse. You're a nurse? No. I'm Oscar Goldman. I'm the nurse. Is this a joke? I personally requested Nurse Sommers. STARKEY: There's a jungle war going on in that country, and you want to send a woman in there? No offense, but a jungle war's the last place a woman ought to be. Well, it seems to me that a jungle war is the last place anybody ought to be, and that's why we're going in to get the ambassador out. You ever been in the jungle, lady? Nope. It's dirty, it's slimy, it's hot and it's miserable. There's poisonous snakes. Behind every tree there's gun-slinging guerrillas. Well, I don't know what you're worried about, Starkey. Bullets mostly. Nobody's gonna shoot at a medical team. No. They'll give us Hershey bars, right? Wrong. They might use that white cross for target practice. Well, that's just a chance that we're gonna have to take. Now, if you don't think you can handle this... I can handle this. I admire your courage, Sommers. I'm not too sure about your brain. We might as well get this turkey on the road. (SIGHS) Be careful. I don't believe this. STARKEY: Well, we're over Costa Bravo now. JAIME: What's that up ahead there? Real bullets. Real soldiers. They don't care much for Americans. JAIME: How are we gonna find Ambassador Morehouse? STARKEY: This radio direction finder should lead us right to the ambassador. You know, I'd give us a 50-50 chance of coming out of this alive. 50-50? Oh, come on Starkey, the odds can't be that bad. With you as a partner, maybe worse. Why are you doing this? Best reason around, honey. Cold, hard cash. Why are you in this? Sense of duty, I'll bet. (SPEAKING SPANISH) (MAN SPEAKING SPANISH) (EXPLOSION) Starkey! We're hit! No, they won't shoot at a medical team. Well, what's wrong? Controls are jammed. We're going down! Steering cable's been hit! Come on! Pull up! Pull up! Come on! Pull up! (BIONIC POWERS ACTIVATING) Come on! Pull up! Come on! Pull up! We're still gonna crash! Hang on, we're going in! Brace yourself, Sommers! This is it! (CRASHING) (RADIO BUZZING) Please, we need help. We need help now. Battery's starting to get low, Judith. Haven't they heard us? If they have, I hope they hurry. (SPEAKING SPANISH) (COUGHING) (BIONIC POWERS ACTIVATING) (DOOR THUDS) (EXCLAIMS) That's the stuff. (MOANING) (COUGHING) (GRUNTS) Hi. How'd we get out? The last thing I remember... Uh, I don't know how you did it, Starkey, but it was fantastic. Thank you. Yeah. You're welcome. How'd we get over here? The crash just threw us clear. (SIGHS) (CLEARS THROAT) Well... What kind of nurse are you? I'm bleeding. You want me to bandage it? Don't you think that'd be a swell start? Yeah. No Band-Aids. Got it. There. All done. Are you sure? A little loose? A little loose? I hope we don't get in a strong wind. Look at that. It's a miracle I brought us down at all. Not great, Sommers. Not great. But any time you walk away from a landing, it's a good one. One thing is sure. She won't be taking us out of here. Yeah. Or the ambassador. I think we ought to start looking, Starkey. Start looking? The mission's over. We just ate it. Listen, now you can insult me about my bandages, and you can frighten me about bullets, but you can't tell me that we're... We got to get out of here. Otherwise, our lives are not worth a plug nickel. Well, in that case, we may as well find the ambassador. (SIGHS) All right. All right. I'll get my radio equipment. If I can find something to fly at that depot, otherwise we won't get out of this alive. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Starkey, are you sure we're going in the right direction? STARKEY: Signal's weak, but the direction-finder says we're headed the right way. (LEAVES RUSTLING) Starkey. I thought that I heard something. The jungle's making you jumpy. (HISSING) Starkey! What is it now? (SNAKE HISSING) (BIONIC POWERS ACTIVATING) Did you stomp on it? I hate snakes. I hate snakes. Boy, your adrenalin must really be flowing. (CLEARS THROAT) Come on. Let's go. Let's go. JAIME: How much farther do you think it is? Less than a half mile. Legs getting heavy? Not a bit. How about yours? Fine. (SIGHING) Wait! (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) No, no, Starkey. It's coming from over this way. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Leave him. If he weren't wounded, he wouldn't think twice about killing both of us. (SPEAKING SPANISH) (GROANING) Wait a minute. I wouldn't want you to hurt yourself. (BIONIC POWERS ACTIVATING) (GRUNTING) Okay? Oh, Starkey, that was beautiful. Thanks. You better give him some pain killer. Pain killer. (STUTTERING) With a needle? With a needle. Oh, never mind, I'll do it. (SPEAKING SPANISH) We're keeping the ambassador waiting. Bring your bag and come on, Nurse. Hey! We made it. STARKEY: No more than half way. We've still got to get out. How's your signal doing? Weaker by the minute. Seems to be coming from one of those buildings over there at the depot. (LEAVES RUSTLING) Starkey! Hit it! (SPEAKING SPANISH) JAIME: (STUTTERS) Wait, he can't be more than 12. (SPEAKING SPANISH) (SPEAKING SPANISH) (SPITS) American pig! Hey! Wait a minute, kid. (SPITS) Why did you do that? We're not gonna hurt you, you know. Only pigs fight for the guerrillas. Hey, we don't fight for anybody. Why did you save that soldier, back there? (SPEAKS SPANISH) Because he was gonna die. The guerrillas kill my parents. They deserve to die. I'm sorry. STARKEY: Why were you following us? Hey! Your feet hurt? Come here. Come here. Come on. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Okay. (THANKS IN SPANISH) You're welcome. Next time, steal a pair that fits, all right? How long have you been on your own? A week or two. I stay in the jungle. Got a name? Julio. Okay, Julio. My name's Jaime. And that over there is Mr. Starkey. Now we're gonna go over to that depot. You want to come? Sommers? Just a sec. What's the matter with you? Well, we can't leave him here. Well, we can't take him with us. The kid can barely walk. He'll slow us down. I'll carry him. You'll what? (STAMMERS) He can ride on my shoulders. You'll never make it. Your legs aren't strong enough. Well, then you carry him. Me carry him? Not in a blue moon, a month of Sundays, or till Biloxi, Mississippi freezes over am I walking through the jungle with a kid on my back, and that's final! How are your legs holding up? Fine, it's good exercise. I just wondered, 'cause you look a little beat to me. Oh, no. Just a little hungry. Where did you get that? I picked it up when I was following you. You said you were hungry. I'm not that hungry. Get it out of here. Do you eat those? Si. Good meat, but they're hard to catch. You killed it, so half belongs to you. Uh. Julio. Finders keepers, honey. It's all yours. Gracias. Uh, since you don't want it. Don't want it. (MACHINE BEEPING) Signal's coming from around here. He's got to be somewhere near here. STARKEY: No way anybody could survive in this kind of shelling. Morehouse? Hey, you know what? We're close enough now. Bet that you could reach him on this radio. Maybe. (RADIO CRACKLING) Do you read, Morehouse? Do you read? (ON RADIO) Do you read, Morehouse? Do you read, Morehouse? Do you read? Come in, please. Morehouse, do you read? This is Morehouse. Look, I hear you! We're buried underneath the supply depot. Help us! Please help us! (RADIO CRACKLING) STARKEY: Morehouse, do you read? Over! Morehouse, do you read? Please come in. I hear you! We hear you! Please help us! Come in! Oh, dear God! It's dead. (SOBBING) They'll never hear us. (CLICKS TONGUE) They'll never find us. (CRYING) (RADIO BUZZING) There's no signal. His battery's probably just dead. Or he is. (MEN SPEAKING SPANISH) JULIO: SeÃ±or Morehouse? STARKEY: Morehouse? Oh, I give up. This is ridiculous, Sommers. Well, I know he's around here. Well, what if he is? And what if we find out where and he's still alive. Even then, it's gonna take an army of men and a bulldozer to get him out of here. But we've got to get him out of here. Now, that's all there is to it. How? The guerrillas must have seen our chopper come down, and you can be cotton-picking sure they're out there looking for us right now, and pretty soon they're gonna be in here looking for us, and I'm not gonna hang around looking for a dead man. Well, lam. Good. Good. You do that. You just hang around right in here. At least you won't be in my way. I'm going out and try to find some way to get us out of here. Come on, kid. Give me a hand. Go on. (SOBBING) (SPEAKING SPANISH) (FAINT METALLIC CLANKING) (BIONIC POWERS ACTIVATING) (LOUD RUMBLING) (HISSING) No way! SeÃ±or Starkey! SeÃ±or Starkey! (SPEAKS SPANISH) Come here! How's this? Hey! Muy Bonita, kid. Muy Bonita. This dog looks like it just might hunt. Go get Sommers. Tell her we just bought her a return ticket. Pronto, kid! Pronto! (BIONIC POWERS ACTIVATING) George, I hear something. (RUMBLING) Somebody's up there! (BIONIC POWERS ACTIVATING) (THUDDING) Thank God. They found us. (BIONIC POWERS ACTIVATING) (SPEAKING SPANISH) (SPEAKING SPANISH) The rock. How are you so strong? Go tell Starkey I found someone. Julio, I found the ambassador. Forget the rock! The excitement has given me strength. (STUTTERS) Do you understand that? (SPEAKING SPANISH) What does Starkey want? He found an airplane. Your ticket ride. He wanted you to come. (STUTTERS) Oh, I can't. Uh, tell him that I need him. JULIO: But he said that... Julio, go now and tell him. (SPEAKING SPANISH) (BIONIC POWERS ACTIVATING) Oh, thank God! Thank God you're here. Thank God! Ambassador Morehouse? Yes! How many of you are down here? Just my wife. But she's pinned under some concrete. Come on. Let me check. Thank you. (GRUNTING) Are you hurt? No, I'm all right. (CRYING) Mrs. Morehouse, come on. Come here. Hey, look at me. Now we're gonna get out of here. Okay? But you have to help me. Yes. Now, when I tell you, I want you to pull on your leg really hard. Okay? Okay. Can you do that? Let's go home. (SOBBING) Come on. You ready? Yes. Yes. All right. (BIONIC POWERS ACTIVATING) Pull! (GRUNTING) (BIONIC POWERS ACTIVATING) Come here. Come here. (BREATHING HEAVILY) Come on. Can you stand up? Yes. Yes. Hold yourself. I'm gonna get up a little bit. Okay. Okay. Give me your hand. Come on. (GRUNTING) (SPEAKING SPANISH) Starkey, we're over here. We need help. Lean on me. Get away. Take it easy. Okay. You got her? How'd you... How'd you dig them out? There was a four ton pile of concrete here. I told you, SeÃ±or Starkey! She is very strong. Are there any sign of the guerrillas? The guerrillas, Stark. Yeah. Yeah. They'll be here anytime. We... We're gonna have to hide in the jungle. The jungle? What happened to the plane? It's hopeless. It's got pretzels for landing gear. Well, maybe we could fix it. There's no way. Well, I would like to see for myself. Sommers... Doesn't look too bad to me. I think we can fix that. Not without a vice and some hammers. We can fix it, Starkey. Now what has to be done? I'm telling you, we can't. Those struts are made out of steel. I don't know what's gotten into you, but when I tell you we can't fix that, we can't fix it! And lam sick and tired of you telling me what I can't do. (BIONIC POWERS ACTIVATING) (METAL CREAKING) What kind of woman are you? A very frightened one. Now, what's next? That one over there. (CREAKING) Okay. Now, will that do it? How you do that? Starkey, get these blocks out of here. Get in the plane, and I'll go get the others. No, I'll... Maybe I... Yes, ma'am. Starkey! All right. You get in the back here. Come on. MOREHOUSE: Okay. I'll get in first. Sommers, we got a problem. The engine won't turn over. The battery's dead. Well, what if I spin the propeller? Oh, you can't. It's too heavy. You... On second thought... Jaime, watch your hands! Thanks. Jack. STARKEY: Switch on. (BIONIC POWERS ACTIVATING) (ENGINE SPUTTERING) (ENGINE STARTING) Okay. Give me this. Okay, Julio, in the plane. Come on. We can't take the kid. We're overloaded. What do you mean, we can't take him? If it wasn't for Julio, we wouldn't... STARKEY: We're overloaded. There's a cliff up there. The odds are we'll drop like a rock. Oh, Starkey, please! They're here! Hurry up! Let's go! (GUNS FIRING) Come on, kid. (SPEAKING SPANISH) (GUNS FIRING) Come on. You can go faster. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Go faster, baby. Go faster. Pull up, baby! Pull up! Please. Come on! (ENGINE SPUTTERING) Well, it's good, though. He'll be in a foster home in a couple of weeks. I don't, uh... I don't have anything to do right now, so I thought I'd kinda hang around, you know, keep him company till then. Yeah, I know. Well, guys. I got to go. Oh, come on. (SNIFFLING) Hey, I'll come back and see you. I promise. Okay? Listen, uh... I want you to know something. It has nothing to do with our secret. I mean, your secret stuff. I want you to know I think you're some special lady. Thanks, Sommers. You're so welcome, Starkey. (SNIFFS) See you. Bye, kid. Yeah. That's some special lady. (SCHOOL BELL RINGING) Morning, Miss Sommers. Hi. Hey, Miss Sommers, got a far out current event. Remember that ambassador that was left in Costa Bravo? Yeah. Well, some hotshot helicopter pilot rescued him this weekend. Really? Sounds exciting. Yeah. The pilot said, "We never would have made it "if it hadn't have been for Lady Luck." (CHUCKLES) Lady Luck. Well, I like that. "Also rescued in that fantastic airplane escape were the ambassador's wife "and a young Costa Bravan boy named Julio." No, it's Julio. ANDREW: Julio. Did you read this? Uh, no. I'm a teacher. I'm supposed to know things like that.
