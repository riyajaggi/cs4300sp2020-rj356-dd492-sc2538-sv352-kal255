 My life's work. I didn't intend for either side to have this secret, but your enemies stole it a month ago and, when I found out, I knew of no one else I could turn to except my old friend, Dr. Rudy Wells. You did the right thing, Eric. Your formula for Cobalt 247 is too great a weapon to be in the hands of only one side. By giving it to us you've restored the balance of power. Within 24 hours that formula

 will be safe in the O.S.I. vaults. You have one of the few minds in the world that can understand my work. Well, have a safe trip, old friend. Excuse me, miss. I'd like a one-way ticket to Rio, please. How'd it go? No problems so far. I've got the formula. And I don't think anybody followed me. Now what's our next move? Well, normally, sir, we wouldn't be able to get you out of here for 24 hours on the regular service, but we do have a charter flight leaving in 30 minutes. Very good. And so you don't seem out of place, Oscar's gonna meet us in Rio in Air Force Two. JAIME: And I'll be your bodyguard till we get there.

 Now, sir, I'll just get your ticket written up quickly. We really movemos our cada for you, senior. You know what that means in English, huh? I can guess. Passenger loading in 15 minutes. Enjoy your flight, sir. Thank you, miss. Yeah, it's just like you figured, Bobby. Yeah, O.S.I: s trying to sneak him aboard a chartered flight. Right. Sure. Okay. What's the plan? Oh, that Bobby's a shrewd character. Figured they'd pull this. But our people made all the necessary arrangements. Bobby will join us, and three of us will board the plane. So, everything's going right on schedule. Dr. Rudy Wells will never reach Rio alive. Welcome aboard. Hello. It is open seating today, so you can sit wherever you like. Okay. Thank you. Mmm-hmm. Uh, is this seat taken? Sit you down. Thank you. Well, I see Bobby's aboard. May I? Of course. Thank you. She's very pretty. Hmm? Yes. (LAUGHS) (BIONIC POWER ACTIVATED) I am partial to the tall, blonde type myself, you know. Mmm. You know, it is a defect that I have observed worldwide. Obviously, you have seen it, too. That is to say that men of every country seem to think that men of other countries are the lucky ones. You know what I mean? Well, for example, we take the Italians. The Italians, they like the Swiss girls, the German men likes the Spanish women, and the Greek... Ah, the Greek, they like the Danes, you know. Never, never, never failed. (ROMERO SNICKERS) Nice legs. Oh, yes. I couldn't have asked for nicer ones if I'd made them myself. Hmm? (LAUGHS) Would you excuse me? Oh, sure, sure. Watch the man sitting beside me, or I'll wind up bodyguarding you. Excuse me, sir. You're gonna have to return to your seat now. Thank you, miss. JAIME: (ON PA) - Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I'm your stewardess, Miss Winters. Our aft compartment is full of cargo this afternoon, so it will be off limits for the passengers. And dinner, such as it is, will be served in about an hour. Please fasten your seat belts and observe the No Smoking signs. Pressure's low on Number Four. Feels like a turbine lag. Well, she's giving 75% power, that's enough for a go. Okay. Captain, the passengers are ready for takeoff. Well, that's nice. You better get back to your seat. And hang on, here we go. (LAUGHS) Smoking is now permitted. Please feel free to move about the cabin. We will be flying at an altitude of 38,000 feet and a ground speed of 610 miles per hour, and our estimated flying time to Rio is five hours and 10 minutes. Well, next time we touch ground, we should be millionaires. Are you sure we can bail out of this thing? Of course. Three chutes and guns were loaded into the cargo section of the plane. We get them when Bobby gives us the cue. After we get Wells, we'll make the pilot slow to 140 knots, 2,000 feet. We reach the rendezvous point, we bail out. The ship will pick us up. I get it. We go alone because Bobby's more valuable staying under cover. (BIONIC POWER ACTIVATED) MRS. GRIFFITH: I see you're reading a medical textbook. Are you interested in medicine? No, no, no. Just a hobby. I gave up medicine quite a while ago. Uh, what kind of work are you in? Missionary. You know, I had a calling to the cloth myself once. I felt that my experiences, you know, in the gutter, might serve useful purposes. What do you mean, you left medicine? I was arraigned on trumped-up charges, brought before the Board of Review in my junior year in med school. You know, those phonies actually accused me of being drunk in class. No. Care for a nip? No, thank you. Oh. Well, I tried to tell them that it, uh, was the alcohol fumes in the lab that made me stagger, but they wouldn't believe me. You sure you wouldn't care for a little? Positively not! (CHUCKLES) (RUMBLING) CO-PILOT: Flight Service has a heavy storm front building up fast due east. Cloud tops are at 40,000 already. Get us a course change and climb to 41,000. Rio Control, Rio Control, request vector to new course and climb to flight level 41, over. This is the best we've got. Thank you. Anything you have would be delicious. (RUMBLES) Oh! I'm so sorry! My pleasure. May I help you? There must be something that I can do for you. Yes, there is. Please get your hand off my ham and cheese. In times like these, our faith stands us in good stead. I know we're in the Lord's hands. Yeah, but that's what worries me. I just hope that his, uh, pleasure with you offsets his displeasure with me. Here's a little dinner. Thank you. (BEEPING) (SIGNAL BEEPING) Homing signal. Right on time. Keep tracking it. We'll change course and close in on the rendezvous point. SAM: Some new course they gave us. We're heading right into it. This other route's worse. Baker Island reports the winds are at typhoon force. All right. Slow to maneuvering speed. We'll have to ride it out. Get back there and keep the customers calm. What'll I tell them? Lie a lot. Say there's nothing to worry about. JAIME: It's all right, ladies and gentlemen. Keep your seats, please! It's all right! Come on! But I'm scared. Sit down. It's all right. (THUNDER RUMBLES) We'll be above the storm in a few minutes. Now, just relax, everybody. Lightning hit the engine! It's on fire! We got a fire and the compressor stalled on Number Four. Shut off the hydraulic fuel valve. Everyone please stay in your seats! MAN: Shouldn't you do something? Now if you keep your belts tight, too... (THUNDER CRASHING) Not responding! Fire is spreading fast. Discharge the bottle on Number Four. We're gonna be safe as long as you don't panic! SAM: My God, we've lost the engine. The hydraulic system's gone. Keep your seats! (PASSENGERS CLAMORING) I never want to take another plane. (EXCLAIMING IN SPANISH) Why doesn't the pilot pull up? Sam! Hydraulics gone. Can't pull up. (BIONIC POWER ACTIVATED) It's all right. It's all right. It's gonna be all right! (PEOPLE SCREAMING) It's gonna be all right! It's gonna be all right! Sam! Sam, help me. The hydraulic controls went out. Slammed us against the panel. We couldn't budge it. How did you pull it out? I... I don't know. But can you hold it? Not for long. Put out a distress call. Mayday, mayday... This is 553, we're going down. I repeat, we are going down! There's the coastline. Get the geese ready for ditching. Ladies and gentlemen, the coast is below us. We're going to make an emergency landing. No! You gotta be kidding. We'll try and get as close to the shoreline as possible. Your life jackets are underneath your seats. I want you to get them out, put them on, and get into the ditching position. Come on! Hurry up! I don't know how to swim. What do you do with it? You don't know how to put it on? No. It's all right. Come on. Don't worry. Don't panic. There you go. Strap goes around the back. Sir, will you please hurry and put your life jacket on? Okay. Okay. Getting Wells wasn't supposed to get us killed, too. Hey! It don't make no difference if we don't get Wells. Bobby never excuses failures. Get your heads down on your pillows. Take all eyeglasses off and all sharp objects out of your pockets. Put your heads down! Now brace yourselves, and stay that way! SAM: Here it comes! MRS. GRIFFITH: We're going to sink! MAN 1: No, no. - We'll be all right. MAN 2: Come on! - Let's get out of here. WOMAN: I can't swim! MAN 3: We'll be all right! (ALL CLAMORING) Please! The door! Pull it! Pull the lever! Pull the lever, please! It's stuck. The door is stuck! He can't open the door! The cargo door! In the back! Come on! Come on! Come on! Will you get the rafts out of the overhang? Right. Kick it in! Kick it in! MAN: The cargo is blocking the door! Come on! (BIONIC POWER ACTIVATED) Rudy, get the rafts outside and then check the pilots. Right. Listen! Listen to me! I have the front door open! Now come this way. MAN: Let's go! - Let's move it! JAIME: Don't crowd! JAIME: Come on, come on! Help! The pilot's the only one alive. After you! Get going! Uh! The plane? It's gone, Sam. The rest of us are in good shape. Well, it looks like we've taken care of everybody. I wanna thank you for your help. Self-taught, I'm afraid. I do the nursing for the mission. Where's the stewardess? Left to explore inland about an hour ago. That way. Why'd you let her go? Hey, I'm nobody's keeper. She said not to follow her, it could be dangerous. Jaime! Jaime! Where are you? JAIME: Rudy! Hey, Rudy, here I come. (BIONIC POWER ACTIVATED) You look like a bionic Santa Claus. Well, figured there'd be a lot of hungry people this morning. How about you? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Okay. I have berries, and there, uh, there's fruit. I know what I've got for you. Come here. Have a seat, Mr. Wells, and I will serve you breakfast. How's that? Perfect! (BIONIC POWER ACTIVATED) (CHUCKLES) Here you go. Thank you. You know, Jaime, a few years ago when bionics were just a, just an idea in my head, a dream, a lot of notes and schematic drawings... Now, I look at you... You realize it was all a crazy dream and it's not gonna work. Right? That's not quite what I was gonna say. Oh? You mean you don't know how Dr. Frankenstein felt? You're pretty chipper this morning, considering what we went through. Yes. I think I have a right to be. I mean, we're alive and we're safe. The tables have turned, huh? The bionic daughter taking care of the old man? Worries about him, too. I do not. This is just a job, and you're just another person who happened to bring me back from the dead, and hold my hand through all of my traumas, and gave me another chance at life, and Steve, and besides being one of my favorite people... I mean, what have you done for me lately, Mr. Wells? Yes, I am happy. This is practically a deserted island, and, uh... I think we'll be safe here for awhile. I don't have to worry about somebody going after that head of yours with Dr. Frankus' cobalt theory locked up in it. (BEEPING) Well, the ship's within 200 miles. It should be here in about 24 hours. Well, what did Bobby say? I mean, do we get Wells now or wait? No, we wait for the ship. There's too many people around. We might blow it without guns. Look, uh... Let's go get some firewood, we'll bring it back. (SCREAMS) Did you see it? That's a poisonous snake. Marshland's probably full of 'em. Come on. Looking good, guys. Can't fool me. I know you were Boy Scouts. That's all there is to it. (CHUCKLES) How you doing? (SIGHS) I feel like the Red Baron after he tangled with the Sopwith Camel. Mighty poorly. Look, take charge in my place. Get them organized. Standard rescue procedures. You know what they are? Sure. I'll just get 'em all in a group and we can stand there and holler "Help." (BOTH LAUGHING) Uh, don't worry about a thing. I know what to do. Good. Okay. You just relax. Okay, everybody, can I have your attention for a minute, please? We have sent out a mayday signal, which means that they are looking for us. Now that means that this fire is the most important thing in our lives. We gotta keep it going night and day. So we're gonna need some people to help gather more firewood and serve as lookouts. Now, do I have any volunteers? Just tell me what to do. Anything. I'll do anything you want. Uh, yeah, yeah... You make up a duty roster. All right? Now, uh... Now remember everybody, if a plane does spot us today, we could be out of this mess by nightfall, huh? (ALL CHEERING) (BEEPING) ROMERO: If we hope to be rescued, we need more wood. Rudy? Yeah. Uh, if you need someone with medical experience to spell you, I think he was once a med student. Uh, couldn't hurt to ask, huh? No. Give it a try. Hi. Hi. Listen, I understand you've had some medical experience. The doctor could sure use some help. Sorry, honey, I can't even help myself. Mmm. Well, it's not the booze. That came after I dropped out. I just couldn't cut medicine, that's all. (SCOFFS) Well, you know, I don't think people would like a medic that looked at a wound and went "Yuck!" I don't find that amusing at all. Maybe you can't stop people from hurting each other, but doctoring does give people a second chance. Does it not? And it seems to me that's something we could all use. I'm sorry, Jaime. It hurts me too much to see pain. MRS. GRIFFITH: Doctor, her wound worries me. Is there any way we can sterilize it? Sorry. We don't have alcohol or anything. Aw! Doc! Yeah? (SIGHS) Thank you! All right. I'll help her, but I won't... I can't do any doctoring. Okay? (BIONIC POWER ACTIVATED) (ENGINE HUMMING) It's a plane! I don't hear anything. It's right there! MAN: (ON RADIO) - We should be about over the area where they went down. I don't see anything! Right there! (ALL CHEERING) Okay, okay, wait a minute, everybody. Now, listen, we gotta get some smoke going. So, let's get some of that salt grass and leaves and put them on the fire. Look! There's smoke down there. Hey! He sees us! He's rocking his wings! He's gonna make a drop. Knock it off! Come on, pass out that food to the other people! I'll take that. Let's move! Come on! We need something else. Yeah, I know. The radio. It must be in another chute pack. It got bent landing. I can't open it. Would you care to make way for the six million dollar can opener? (BIONIC POWER ACTIVATED) Hello, Rescue, this is, uh, 553, or what's left of it. Boy, are we glad to see you. Jaime! Am I glad to hear your voice. Oscar! What are you doing here? We took off the minute that your mayday was reported. We've been up and down this coast three times trying to find you. OSCAR: ls Rudy with you? He certainly is. Right here, grinning ear to ear. We've notified the Brazilian Navy of your position. There ought to be a boat there tomorrow morning by, oh, 10:00 am. to pick you up. Is everybody all right? I'm sorry that you that have to spend the night there. Oh, we'll manage. Don't worry. Good. I'll see you tomorrow morning then. So long, Jaime. Bye. Fantastic. (LAUGHS) Let's go. Yeah. We have some people to tell something to. Oh, you got it, huh? Hey! Everybody! A boat is gonna be here tomorrow at 10:00 to pick us up and take us home. That's great. Trawler San Carlos. Come in, San Carlos. This is the San Carlos. We've been spotted by a rescue plane, they'll pick us up in the morning. Is Dr. Wells still alive? Yes. We haven't been able to get to him yet. Well, then do it now. We'll get there and pick you up as soon as we can. San Carlos out. Right. Get Bobby. We kill Dr. Wells tonight. Oh, Miss Winters. I thought perhaps you'd want the fire burning through the night. That's very nice. It's gonna be really chilly. I suppose some of us will have to snuggle together, huh? The lucky ones. Here's a medical bag. Came in on the last chute. It was clear out in the toolies. Oh, thank you. The doctor will want this. Where is he? He didn't find you? Find me? Somebody passed the word that you wanted him to meet you. Meet me where? Near the marsh, I... I think. Wasn't it? That's what it sounded like to me. Wait a minute, I... I did not send for him. Now, who gave you this message? Well, the message was just passed voice to voice. I don't know who started it. It's almost dark. He's in that marsh alone? In case something is wrong, I'd better be there. Uh... No, princess. I think you better stay here. One guy lost is enough, huh? (BIONIC POWER ACTIVATED) (BEEPING) Jaime? Where are you? Jaime! Jaime! I'm spending my life looking for you. If you're in there, turn on your bionic ear and listen to me! Rudy? (BIONIC POWER ACTIVATED) Rudy! Don't move! Oh, I hate snakes. (GROANS) Somebody hit me from behind and... You wanna tell me once again how safe we are? We can't go back to the beach 'cause it could be anybody. And if they're that anxious to kill you, they'd probably hurt a lot of innocent people. So, we better camp out tonight. I think it would be a good idea. It's okay with me. CONNORS: Well, it almost worked, Bobby. So accidents happen. In a few more hours they'll be less alert, then just come back and kill them. Right. Miss Winters? Miss Winters? Have you seen Miss Winters? No, I haven't. I was asleep. What's the matter? Go back to sleep. Miss Winters? Well, it'll be getting light soon. I wouldn't count on anything, this trip. It's freezing out here. Oh, here. Here... My hero again. Uh-huh. Rudy! Get down! (GROANING IN PAIN) Lay still. Lay still. (YELLS) Connors! I've been bitten by a snake! Help me, Connors! I'm bleeding pretty good. No, a tourniquet won't work there. I need a pressure bandage. Did you see who it was? It's too dark. But I heard a... I heard a man call to someone named Connors, so there's more than one. Connors, where are you? Help me! I can't walk! Don't trust anyone. I can hold out. Not without some doctoring. You can't do that by yourself, and I sure can't. What I need is... Shh. ROMERO: Miss Winters! Miss Winters! It's Romero. I never thought I'd be glad to see him. You be careful. Are you all right? Romero? We've got an emergency. I need the nurse, Mrs. Griffith. Would you get her up here as fast as you can? And please send her alone. All right? Of course. Right away! Right away. Rudy, hang in there, babe. Help's on the way. Mrs. Griffith'll be here in a few minutes. Where's the missionary? I don't know. This is an emergency! There she is. Ah-ha! Mrs. Griffith. Why, what's the matter? Miss Winters said it... It is an emergency. What happened? I don't know. But I heard some shooting just before I got there. I'll get the medical bag. Who got hurt? I don't know. I don't know. We'll take care of 'em. This way... This... How am I doing, Doc? You're tough. At least you're not telling me to take two aspirins and call you in the morning. (COUGHS) Stop with the doctor jokes, Doctor. I know people have a lot of blood in them, but... It always seems worse when it's your own. (EXHALES) What are you doing here? Standing guard. She said not to let anybody through. Except her. You better move on, senora. Show me. Ah, yes... Just beyond those rocks? You see, you turn to the right... I'm going up there to finish them. Yeah. Well, you better take that little girl by surprise. I'll take her by surprise, all right. She's given me enough trouble. Don't you need the gun? I've got everything I want right here. Miss Winters. Doctor Wells? It's Mrs. Griffith. Well, that's strange. What? She didn't take any bandages. How could she go without bandages? Well, weren't there some in her bag? No. We used them all. These are the only ones left. Oh, I came as fast as I could. Did you see anyone down there when you came up? Not a soul. (MRS. GRIFFITH GRUNTS) (GROANS) I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you. It's okay. MRS. GRIFFITH: You know, I'm not a doctor, but that bullet has to come out. Okay. I'll need your help. I want you to apply pressure to both sides of the wound. That's right. Hold him like that. (BIONIC POWER ACTIVATED) Oh. (BIONIC POWER ACTIVATED) Marlow? Need some help? I don't know... Are you a good guy or a bad guy? Well, that depends on how you mean it! I can't give you many good character references! Yes, I do need help. Would you come up here, please? Quickly! Listen, would you watch him? Help him. Jaime, I can't... Help him! Please! It's no good. He's bleeding too much. I can't stop it. You mean you can't get the bullet out? It's not the bullet. The vein's been clipped. Well, sew it up. Not here. Well, there must be some way you can stop the bleeding. Yeah, if I was in a hospital I could do... Well, what would you do? Cauterize it! So... So all you really need is a couple of hot electric wires, huh? Yeah. That's all I need. Hand me the scalpel. Where am I gonna get two hot wires in this jungle? Listen, I don't ever want you to tell anyone what you're gonna see now. Do you understand that? Yeah. Hey, what are you cutting your finger for? It's not gonna hurt. Don't worry. Wires? Inside your finger? Now take my hand. You have here two hot electric wires. And cauterize that vein. It's all right. His life depends on it! Please! (ELECTRIC SPARKING) Well, we did it. The bleeding's stopped. Can you take the bullet out now? I'll try. JAIME: Rudy, you're gonna be okay. OSCAR: Lieutenant, I want those two men and Mrs. Griffith held under close guard. Hey! Rudy, I told you it was gonna be all right. What happened? Oh, I cut myself shaving. Thanks for saving my life, Jaime. Well, I was purely selfish. Besides, where would I go for spare parts if anything happened to you, huh? All right. Get him on board. See you, Oscar. Rudy. Oh! Uh... Thank you. Hey, thank you. Marlow! Uh... Good luck, Doc. Miss Winter... Uh, excuse me. I would like to tell Miss Winters how wonderful she's been. And how... Miss Winters. I will come straight to the point. You see, my wife and I have not been too happy for, well, for many years. And, so, I will insist on a divorce. No. Everything will be fine. You and me together with the children. Ah, the children. You will love the children. Children? Nine of them. Very well mannered. You'll make a good mother to them. Mr. Romero. Now, you and your wife can't possibly be that unhappy. I mean, after all, there have obviously been a few bright spots over the years. Have there not? Now I can't break up your home. But you do not understand. You see... Now we must be brave. Both of us. And, and sacrifice our happiness. We will simply have to live in the memory of what could have been. Que mujer. Que corazén. What character. Oh, my darling. And I... And I also feel that quick goodbyes are the very best. I mean, why torture ourselves? What was that all about? Oh, I'm telling you that's the closest call I've had on this whole trip. Is he dangerous? Yeah! He had life imprisonment in mind. (LAUGHING) Miss Winters! I have a solution! Hold the boat, please!
