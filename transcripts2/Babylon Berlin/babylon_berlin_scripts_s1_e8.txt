 Previously on Babylon Berlin. - I'm Fritz. - Greta. Greta. Nice name. I don't have to tell you that everything you hear in this house - is highly confidential. - No, I know that. In those sheds there are 13 cases of treason, due to the illegal import of warfare agents. Anti-aircraft guns, tanks, heavy guns. And now... poison gas. - Where is the film? - You don't know who you're dealing with. They only ever made one copy of each of König's films. The courier always took them.

 You know I guaranteed that we would solve this problem before the elections. Bruno? I need your help. - Krajewski is the key. - Finally. Stay calm. Nothing will happen to you. Relax your body. All fetters fall off you. Inhale very deeply... and exhale. Yes. Good. Your body is relaxing. And all fetters fall off you, if you want it. Now focus on your eyes, on the little muscles behind your eyes, as they loosen up. And when you notice

 that your eyes won't open anymore, even if you want them to, then nod. I will take the blindfold off now. But you will notice that your eyes are so relaxed that they won't open anymore. And now we will further enhance this state of relaxation which is flowing through your entire body now, by you opening your eyes once very briefly and closing them again. When you close them, you will enter an even deeper state of relaxation. Open your eyes now. First of all you need to dust the library. But be careful. Many of the tomes are very valuable. OK. And then, like we said, a basic cleaning. First the stairs, then the skirting boards, then the floors, take the rugs out and beat them. Then do the silver like I showed you. You were able to shine it so wonderfully. Children, get into the taxi. Dinner at 8 p.m. Cheese and salad, as always, cucumber, but no pickles, they're too salty. And Greta? I know he will ask for it, but he mustn't have meat. Not even ham or cold meats. Dr. Hutten has emphasized it again. So, no exceptions. Tell him there is nothing in the house and that I prepared the dinner, - so he won't get the wrong idea. Yes? - Yes. And now I'll leave you alone. Right, my dears, off we go. Please go. Nice dress. Thanks. I need to be back for half past seven. Matter of honor. Eight at the latest, when the old man comes home. Young man, remember, last trip back in 60 minutes. If you're not here on time, you and your girl will have to swim. Please get in, ladies and gentlemen. Tickets, please. The way here was free, the return trip is double the price. Mrs. Benda doesn't mean it. She's just very exact. Girl, they're bigwigs. They're born to bully. I just want to do it all correctly. That's exactly their method, that you defend them in the end. Stop. Don't say that. But that's the way it is. I'm glad to have any work at all. You are listed as accused now. This means, you don't have to make a statement. The police has the burden of proof, not us. When do I get out? I made an appointment with the magistrate after the hearing, and if he complies... When do I get out of here? I know that man. Which doesn't mean he will comply. - This way. - One moment. Why this way? Where are you taking Mr. Nyssen? - I demand an explanation. - Round the front. - Through the entrance hall? - That's the instruction. That can't be true. - There he is! - Step aside. Step aside, out of the way. Switch off your devices. - What are you accused of? - He is presumed innocent! I don't believe this! None of these pictures must be published. Who arranged this? Who informed the press? Did you? We have freedom of the press in the German Reich. They led us through the main entrance on purpose. This is a put-up job. Let's get to the point. This is the analysis of the freight. You behave as if this was a trifle. For whom does Nyssen AG or rather you, Mr. Nyssen, order chemical weaponry? Importing pesticides is neither banned nor limited. Please let your client speak for himself. For whom is the poison gas? Who is the recipient? I was duped. I ordered pesticides. Right. What for? For pest control. Nyssen AG deals with iron, steel. You produce heavy goods. My mother's corporation has nothing to do with this. No? I know your mother. She would be amazed at the things that are smuggled through the country in her name. We won't make a statement, as long as you have Mr. Nyssen registered as accused. I just want to make sure Mr. Nyssen is willing to face the mus for the people who are behind this. I'm taking my client to the magistrate now. He will put this untenable matter to bed without batting an eye. The results of the analysis are unambiguous. Please sit down, solicitor. There is phosgene in those wagons. According to the Geneva Protocol and the Treaty of Versailles it's a banned chemical warfare agent. With this quantity you could wipe out all life in a city the size of Berlin. You will have to answer for this. No one would let anything like this go without batting an eye. Right. Would you give us a minute in private? I'm outside the door if you need me. I know who people like you think of as pests. I also know what drives the men in your environment. But if I inform the allied gun control commission and the League of Nations... Then you wouldn't do yourself any favors. You feel protected by your friends, do you? What makes you so sure you're not mistaken? I know lots of these men. For them you are nothing but a puppet. You're the puppet. The puppet of a democratic aberration which has taken hold of this country. No. Nyssen, undress. Everything. I give you all of this. The water, the clouds, the sun. And this shack. Sooner or later, it will all be expropriated anyway. Oh my God. The ferry! We have to go back or I won't make it for eight. You're home by eight. I promise. I have to go to work or they'll sack me. Fritz, please! You can trust me. I only mean you well. - This is the last one. - Yes. So? - I can't swim across. - Greta. Do you trust me? Watch. Fritz? Hang on, doll. Patience. Fritz? Almost ready. One second. - You knew about this. - Here you are. - What? - You've been here before. I had to arrange your return trip somehow. Yeah, the bread is old, but the beer is cold. There's the shore. Careful at the trees. Come on, come on! It'll be tight. You have my word, Greta. The next one is in two minutes. Otto. Have you been waiting long? Right, let's try these. - Barbituric acid derivate. - What is it? For people like you it's pure nerve gold. Give me two more of those, please. Six to eight drops. It'll take a while until you find the right dose. Keep the change. Thank you. Bye. Tomorrow morning, 7 a.m. Good night, Krüger. - Hello? - Coming! Good evening, Mr. Councillor. Miss Overbeck. Everyone is gone. - Your wife prepared some dinner for you. - No, certainly not. Please fry... these for me. I've been looking forward to them all week. And please get me a beer from the cellar, on the left, behind the coal. Thank you, Greta. - Nearly done. - What a lovely smell. I always get them from Scheunenviertel. It's the only place. Have you eaten, Miss Overbeck? - Me? No, later, when you have eaten... - Would you keep me company? I'll get another beer. Here, they taste best right here in the kitchen. Come on. By the way, Greta. No word to anyone. We're surrounded by enemies of the state. You have a visitor. Ten minutes, no bodily contact. What's up? These are hard times for me. They'll get worse now. You have no idea how bad it is already. Yes, I have. I'm to blame. No. No, Svetlana, you're not. You're not to... Be silent and listen to me. You trusted me. I betrayed you. What are you talking about? I'm talking about the train. What do you know about the train? Everything. Come here! Get the coppers! Do you hear me? Come here! Come here at last, come here! Are you ready? Yes, get the coppers, I need my stuff! In there? That's impossible. What kind of place is this? It's where the bigwigs go. First they chat and eat, then they dance and screw. Politicians, bankers, our bosses. - Where is the film? - This will be trouble. Behind the restaurant, up the stairs, there are rooms. Where are the films stored? In the Armenian's room. Shit. - What Armenian? Who is he? - Listen. We'll go home, get the official papers, and we'll come back tomorrow with a full team... - Where's the room? - Past the bar, there is a hallway with a door on the other side of the room. - Can I have my bloody stuff already? - In that room... where are the films? There is a rock, a huge boulder, and all the stuff is in there. - A safe? - Something like that. - And the Armenian has the key? - No, it's in the golden thingies... I don't know, moons. No, don't go. No, don't go! Stay here, you arseholes. You promised! I'll go in first. You'll send him in after. - Good evening, sir. - I have a reservation. How about you go in and kick up a fuss? - When you come back, I'll give you this. - No. But not before, and only then. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Mocha, please. Coming right up. Right, off you go. Forget it, man. - Get the maıtre. - Like hell I will. Tell him, the Armenian is expecting me. Wait. Crazy my child You must go to Berlin Where the crazies are That's where you belong What is it, Franz? Evening, Edgar. I have something for you. I... found something out. Something... big. It's about heaps of money. - But I want a share of it. - Is that all? Hey! My valuable life time is ticking by, and I don't know what for. So get to the point. The police are channelling off weapons from their storehouse. What I said about the weapons and the police, it's true, I swear. What is this? I know the storehouse. I can take you there. I don't need your connections with the police. I own the police. Don't show your face here again. Don't touch your gun. Don't turn around. I'll shoot you on the spot. To the window. The curtain. Down. Spread it. The inspector from Cologne. Put the films on the fabric. - All of them. - Forget it. Do it. - Shit, you bastards. - Why are you back already? - Shit! - Where is Rath? They'll kill us all. - Pull yourself together. - I want to get away. Away! - Give me my stuff already! - Shut up. Stay here. Hey! Stay here! Get a move on. Boss, is everything alright? Boss? Yes, everything is fine. Get lost. What's going on? How do you want to get out of here? Together with you. Off we go. Gereon Rath. We know everything about you. We know where you live, where you work, when you sleep, when you shit... - Shut up! -we know your pub, your father, your sister-in-law, your nephew, everything. Keep going. Yucatan. Move it, go on. Get down! Stop! Knock it off! No one shoots again. Drop your guns. Don't overdo it, boy. Tell them to drop their guns. Go on. Drop the guns. I said, drop the guns! Pick it up. Keep playing. Stay calm, mate. Stay calm. Go to the car over there. Right, what will you do with him? Get lost. Get out. Here. Take this. Go some place. It's best if you disappear for a while. Do something with it. You really are something. What do we do with the films now? There are politicians in them. It's a kind of life insurance. We'll watch them. Come on. Let's go. I know him. He... is a city councilman. I even know his wife. Oh, wonderful! Everybody who's anybody is in this. How many more do we have? It's the last one. PUBLIC TELEPHONE Please give me Cologne, 13-0-8. - I'm listening. - It's me. Gereon. I've got the film. - All of it? - Yes. Negative and positive. Destroyed. You destroyed everything there and then? Gereon? Of course. Thank you, my son. When are you coming back? I won't come back. Sure? If you want to close my place down, today's the wrong day. Bruno, I have to ask you something. Where did you get my medicine from? From your girl. The little cheeky one, Charlotte. Look at it this way: A guy like me must sure as hell know who is looking over his shoulder. But that's water over the dam. What's that in English? Sex and crime. Edgar. I can see you're very upset. I get it. I'm really very sorry this happened. I'm very grateful to you for acting so prudently. I owe you my thanks. Forever, and you know that. That's how capacities complete each other. - Boss? - Yes? - We've got them. - Where? -At the Pepita Bar. Cheers. - Where is he? - They're sitting over there. We will further enhance this state of relaxation, which is flowing through your entire body now, by you opening your eyes once very briefly and closing them again. When you close them, you will enter an even deeper state of relaxation. Open your eyes now. Good. Close your eyes, but don't try to fight it. I'll count backwards now. One hundred... What happened? Can you hear me? Can you hear me? - Where did you get my medication from? - From your girl. - Can I ask you a favor? - You don't have to. I get it. - Ninety-nine... - You lied to me. - I didn't. - No? Ninety-eight... Ninety-seven... Hey, Mr. Rath. Hello? Wake up. Gereon. What happened? What's the matter? Where have you been all night? Shall I open it for you? Get lost. - What's wrong? - Go away! - I'll get help... - I don't want to see you again. Get lost! Dearest Helga, my thoughts have been churning in my head for days and weeks, of me, of us. They're almost falling over each other. But one of them has caught on and become solid. I can't live our secrecy anymore, I don't want to live it anymore. You say, you can't simply start from scratch in Berlin. I have to understand that, even though I find it hard. But I can't return to Cologne, either. Back to a life which shirks the truth, hides from it. Forgive me. Gereon. No This is not the end of the world Stranded in life and art And the game goes on As we know Many most beautiful re-encounters No This is not the end of the world Stranded in life and art And the game goes on As we know Many most beautiful re-encounters
