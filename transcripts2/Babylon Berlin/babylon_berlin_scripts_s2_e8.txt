 Wolter is meeting someone Jänicke didn't recognize. They're talking about robbing the train, and it says here where exactly. Milestone 127. And they'll all try to stop the train before the border. - Who do you mean, all? - Well, Wolter. Nyssen. Gereon! I'm stuck! Come on. Come on! Come on! Moon and sun. They're both there. Yes, it happens. Both the same size.

 Will you carry me all the way back to the city? Of course. What happened? Here, boss. The train line runs through a forest, but first we have to go through this village. That takes too long. There. We'll go cross-country. Through there. The tracks go around the bend. We can take a short cut. Take good care of her. He's a better driver than me. Gereon. Be careful. I'm telling you, we should have gone left. - No, we need to go east. - Exactly. East is to the left. - But the map is upside down. - But why? - We would have to go backwards otherwise. - I see. This way. - Like I said. - Left. I said left. But you meant right. What now? Let's go. If the train runs faster than 40 km/h, it will have already passed. But why? Because it left three hours ago and we just passed milestone 120. But the 120 doesn't refer to the distance to the engine shed. - What then? - I don't know. You don't know. But you know for sure it doesn't refer to the distance to the engine shed? - I say it hasn't passed yet. - Boss! That's a stop sign. - Line closure. - Like I said. When we're on the train, we have to reckon with him at every corner. - You mean Wolter? - And his men. - At every corner? - I meant bend. No, you mean curve. But why would they rob the train in a curve? Ready? Yes, sir. What's this? - Did I miss a signal? - No idea. There is someone on the tracks. Police. Put it down. Now listen closely. No! Gereon. Gereon. Hands behind your head and lie down! On the double, gentlemen! Company, secure the train. We're looking for wagon TY 23-05. SOROKIN Everything alright out there? Your gun. Throw it to me. Get up there. You're no hero. You're a traitor. No values. No morals. No courage. This is about something else. And you... you work to rule. Like all apple polishers. God! This... This is coal. This... This is... This is all garbage. Coal... Vile coal. Get up there. Now. Come out. Get down there. I want to see your hands. Henning? Czerwinski? Throw away the gun. Out now. Come down. Gas! There's a gas leak! Gas! Drive. Drive! Henning? Czerwinski? How long does the anesthesia work? - It depends. 30 to 60 minutes. - A half hour to an hour. That's what I said. Where is Wolter? Is he down there? - No. Gone. - Not here. Watch out. Disarm all of them. - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. - Hey, boss! Now what? - Now what? You stay here! Disarm the men. Yes, sir. And you? The train is leaving. Go on, drive. Let's go. Faster. Valve. Full steam! If you pull the brake I'll shoot you both. For the cowardly and insidious attack on Councillor Benda and his family, an unknown faction of the Communist Party has taken responsibility. The role of a maid who was arrested on site is still being investigated. This inhuman act is probably directly related to the Communist protesters who were killed on May 1. The same night, the police have started to chase down and arrest insurgent elements in the city. The Red Terror is destabilizing the republic and has to be fought tooth and nail, says Chief of Police Zörgiebel. Zossen. During a train accident last night, a tank wagon filled with chemicals exploded. What led to the accident is still completely unknown. Thank you. - Miss Scheffler? - Yes, Councillor? Away with this one. And when you're done, have the room thoroughly fumigated. - Disinfect it. - Yes, sir. The boss will see you now. Councillor? Happy to make your acquaintance. Congratulations on your investigative success in your own ranks. - Thank you. - Take a seat. Cigarette? Thank you. The events around your colleague Wolter and his illegal activities have made me think. In these tumultuous times it's getting more and more difficult to be able to rely on the political opinions of even your closest colleagues, right? I was thinking of establishing a new department. I'll call it "Internal Revision". Irregularities within our apparatus, conspicuous political behavior, corruption, that sort of thing. I want you to be the head of this department. Unofficially. Officially, you're still with Homicide. Do you swear to tell the truth and nothing but the truth? DISTRICT COURT MAY 1 TRIAL So help me God. I have here the memory minutes, signed by your colleague, Inspector Wolter, Bruno, describing the events during the demonstrations on May 1, 1929. Your colleague accuses the communists to have shot at you and him. That's right! This contradicts all the statements we've heard from all the other witnesses. Wait, I correct myself. From all witnesses who are not members of the Berlin police. Since Inspector Wolter has passed away as I can see from the file, you're the only one who was summoned. Inspector Rath. Can you confirm your colleague's statement? Or do you want to add something under oath today? We were shot at. That's a lie. I hereby confirm the statement of my colleague Bruno Wolter. Liar! Liar! Murderer! The protesters opened fire on us. We were shot at. Quiet! Quiet! Traitor! Thank you. That's enough. - Good performance. Everyone's grateful. - Thank you. We need to go to Sorokina's flat. We can't let that woman get away. This came for you this morning. Department PO. -Personnel office. -Department personnel. STATE POLICE ADMINISTRATION BERLIN Congratulations. Your application has been accepted. You have the job. Congratulations. Welcome to our department. Deputy Ritter. Yes, congrats. Congrats. Come on, let's go see Sorokina. Hello. Please open up Ms. Sorokina's flat. Police. Criminal investigations. Flown out. Charlotte? Look at this. The family portrait? Old Sorokin and his family. Eight children. - So? - Where do you see Svetlana Sorokina? The little one with the mother, right? That's a boy. Look at the face. He even has a sword. And the dress? A christening robe? You mean... the Sorokins didn't have a daughter? At least she's not in the painting. The singer told me that, as children, they were playing with the chauffeur's daughter The family chauffeur. He later betrayed the Sorokins to the Bolsheviks, during the revolution. The entire family was murdered. The people in this painting... They are all dead. Maybe Svetlana is the chauffeur's daughter. That's why she knew about the gold, but... not that it was fake. There's our train. They're casting a tank wagon back there. Like our wagon. Look at this. Impossible. The vessel. The vessel itself. - Is made of... - Of gold. Ladies and gentlemen. I am pleased to present to you the most dazzling star that has fallen out of Russia. For the very first time in Paris, the Comtesse en Noir! Twilight on Sunday Without sleep my life torments me In the storm of the shadows of the past I won't survive the night A black drape of sorrow has fallen from the sky In a white garden We found a gloomy forest I foresee that the angels won't return you to me They know how sad it is for me here without you On Sunday CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR POSITION Hey! You! Drop it! I can't stand your rocking! Drop it! - Mr. Nyssen. - Yes? Mrs. Rath is here. Don't light the candles Let the chants go quiet Everyone who knew us Should think that we're better off there Death is no dream I won't wait for the awakening All my tenderness I want to give you On Sunday On Sunday On Sunday That's enough. Put him against the wall! On behalf of the suppressed masses, Gereon Rath is sentenced to death for perjury. Go! Everyone leave! Go on! Breathe very calmly. Breathe in... and out again. Good. And when I say "now" you will open your eyes. Now. Yes, close your eyes again. Good. Good. And now delve twice as deeply into your relaxed state than before. I'm counting backwards now. Five. And you picture a place... where you feel the most secure. Four... A place where you're safe, loved, secure. It may be in the bosom of the family. I will now take you back... to the source. To the source of your fear. You are in Cologne. In your home town. It is the summer shortly before you are drafted. You long for the war so much, you can't wait to go away and leave everything behind you. There is the woman you love. But there is something that keeps you apart from her. I will guide you... step by step. Step by step... all the way to the source of your fear. All the way to the truth. It is November 14, 1918, just before 9 a.m. The front line between Malmaison and Laffaux. Three... It is now nine minutes past nine. Despite the bad visibility, the enemy intensifies his new attacks. On one, you will wake up. You will open your eyes and finally cover the lie with the images of truth. Two... But you have to remember the image of truth. Gereon! Gereon! And when you open your eyes now, your fear will be in the past. One. Do you recognize me? Anno? Yes. Get up, Gereon. To ashes, to dust Stolen from the light But not yet now Miracles wait until the end Ocean of time Eternal law To ashes, to dust To ashes But not yet now To ashes, to dust Stolen from the light But not yet now Miracles wait until the end Ocean of time Eternal law To ashes, to dust To ashes But not yet now
