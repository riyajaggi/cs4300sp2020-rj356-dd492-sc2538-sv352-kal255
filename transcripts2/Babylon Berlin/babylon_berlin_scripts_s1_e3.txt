 Stop! This is the police! Don't move! Stop immediately! Stop! ANHALTER FREIGHT YARD KREUZBERG, BERLIN Hit the road. Good luck. Your train leaves Zoo Station in two hours. No contact. With nobody. In two nights, you're back in Moscow. Death to the traitors of the Revolution! Everything alright? Where is Kardakov? The secret service is after him. - What? Since when? - We don't know. But it was too risky. Hello there. Hello. Is this the 10:14 from Leningrad? I'd like to see the documents, please. One wagon needs to be put on another track. For the onward journey. Which wagon is it? The last one. Paris, yes? Departs at 3:30 p.m., platform 23. Paris? - Why Paris? - The plan was changed. Why Paris? The wagon needs to go to Istanbul. To Trotsky! Be quiet! Don't ever mention his name. Is there a problem? No! What are you... Give me the documents. Paris? What is this? Why Paris all of a sudden? Give me that right now! I want to talk to Kardakov, no one else. He should be here. Not you. Give me back the documents! Now. I'll kill you. No! No! Stop him! Arrest him! Calm down, you termagant! Let me go! - Who is your superior? - He'll come see you. - You stink. - I was a bit unlucky. It's not broken, you were lucky. Where can I find Mutti? Mutti doesn't want to walk the streets anymore. She only works from home now. It's a fiver. I get two now and you'll give me three later. Second stairs on the left. You got a quarter of an hour. Then you're down here or I'll come up. You're just hanging around here, I've had enough, get it? I've had it. Up to here. Is your mom in there? Excuse me? Out, and take your sister too. And you too. Get lost, Eckelt. Take your coat off and sit there. I said leave it open! Roll up your sleeves now. Go on. Make a fist. What now? Why do you come see Mutti if you don't want the speciality? Get out. One moment. So, who is this? How would I know? Do you think I remember the mugs of all those perverts? Who's the other woman? Martha Konopatzki. But there's no point asking for her, she went back to Pomerania. Where was this picture taken? I don't know. Somewhere in the west. - Address? - I don't have it. But you were there. We were taken there at night. With hats on our heads which they pulled down so much we couldn't see nothing. Who did that? This guy, that guy. I can't tell you that, either. What else do you remember? Naught. Alright, the red nag. It was hanging on the wall staring at us. There, you see? How are you? Have a nice day. Morning, Jänicke. Everything alright? Let me go through. - Hello. - Hello. - Oh, it's the big cast today. - Comrades, men. The president of the police. Hello, August. Yes, alright. Alright! That's enough. At ease. You all know what this is about. There is lots of trouble awaiting us on May first. More than a dozen Communist associations have announced that they will go against the ban on demonstrations. This could lead to a chain reaction. We have to be determined to stop it. Radical forces from all directions have been trying for years to undermine our state and bring chaos to our streets. But we must protect the citizens of our country and our democratic constitution! Therefore, first of all... Our present crews are backed up with forces from Spandau and Zehlendorf. These will be deployed in Kreuzberg, Neukölln, and in Wedding. That's where all the rascals live. - Operation leaders are Reiser, - Present. Blaschewski, Boglau and Wolter. You'll get your equipment from the armory. - Hi, Erwin. - Mr. Wolter. Mauser 98, 100 pieces of ammunition. Next. Hey, Willi, 100 bullets? That's like in the war! Would you prefer this one? MP28, brand new. Of course I prefer this one. The General is in town. Wants to talk to you. No. - Hello, Inspector Rath. - I need an enlargement. A very... large enlargement. - Is that possible? - Yes. Of what exactly? - Oh, here you are. - Doris. - I just wanted to say bye. - Will you relieve me? What is it? Compare cases, systemize them, they call it a catchword register. Wow, you've hit a gold mine. That's worth weeks of work. But I can't do it. All day long in the basement, you wither like a primrose. I don't mind. You do it for me then. I'll give you 70 Pfennig an hour. Ninety. Eighty. Last offer, or I'll do it myself. Deal. Very well, Mrs. Ritter. Have you heard of the French disease? - Pardon? -It's a bacterial infection. Transmitted through mucosal contact. Also called Great Imitator. You mean the rash? It has nothing to do with that. I'll prescribe an ointment for that. So what's wrong with me? Syphilis. You must have heard of that, right? - Do you have changing sexual partners? - I beg your pardon? At my age? - Did you have changing sexual partners? - No, I didn't. I've only ever had one in my life. Maybe it was the beasts. I worked the slaughterhouse for 30 years. Now they don't want me because of this... It's only transmitted from human to human. Affairs? Are you kidding? The Department of Health demands that all cases be documented. The state wants to know what its citizens are up to. So, any love affairs? Could have been a while ago. One. One is enough. Name? He's dead. Will it go away? No. You should go see a doctor, Mrs. Ritter. You should shut your face, Mrs. Cziczewicz. That one time? It was over 20 years ago, it can't be possible. This disease has a very long incubation period. Twenty years, you say? There she is. What's wrong? Mum went to the doctor. And? Bad weeds grow tall. Don't say that. A rash, nothing else. You have to get some ointment for me. - What did he say exactly? - Who? The doctor. I went to see Völcker. That I have reddened skin, she said. Due to the germs. I don't know, nothing special. And now enough of that. But you won't get better in that damp slaughterhouse. That's why they didn't want me anymore. - I could go to the slaughterhouse. - No way. He should rather go find work. But no broad's work at the slaughterhouse. He couldn't get any maggots out with these paws. Why doesn't the girl go if I can't find anything? Are you all right in the head? Toni goes to school. That's what we go to work for. Calm down. I'm still here. I'll be fine. Look at the tramp. Always a tenner in her pocket. - Wonder where she gets them from. - What did you say? - Come on, say it again! - Lotte! - Calm down. - You're on the game but go all sensitive on me? - Go earn some money... - Stop! - Or keep your filthy gob shut! - Are you nuts? That's enough! I'll kill you! - Bastard! - Leave her alone. Stop it! Look. Bloody broads! - Am I the only one... - Nuts or what? Who has any common sense? - Your husband is a rogue. - So? That's why I only have one. Over there, Café Josty. You'll wait for me in the car. Caretaker! I'm sorry. - I forgot my key. - Kardakov, you gave me a fright. - Come on in then. - Thank you. Sveta? Svetlana? A planned thing... Assassination... National affair... Foreign Minister Stresemann... Right, Jänicke. Drive me home now. Emmi. Emmi. - Bruno, I... - Don't worry. It's OK. You rest. I'll take care of it. Lotte. Lotte! I used to sit by your bed. So? You were different then. Is that all? We used to treat each other differently. Yeah, that was before Erich. I didn't choose him. You didn't have to marry the creep because of the brat and get knocked up again. You can talk. You've just been lucky so far. I took care, Ilse. Look at yourself. You're sitting in a dump, you've locked yourself in. What a smug bitch you've become. He's going into the restaurant. Stay calm. - I... to Kardakov. - Get out! - He's my friend. - Get out right now! I'll call the police. Wait! No, don't do that. Alexey Ivanovich! Help! Help! - Thank you. - Already full? I can't eat any more. It was really very good. My Emmi has always been a great chef. I have relatives in Cologne. - You do? - My cousin married an innkeeper. Of a famous inn. Der Bier-Esel. Oh, really? Thank you. Mussels and beer. My father used to be a regular there. His old man will be Cologne's next Chief of Police. If all goes well. Are you going steady? - Pardon? - Married? No. Leave him alone, Emmi. He's had a tough day. Bruno never tells me about his work. It's better that way, Emmi dear. Believe me. Please excuse me. I'm going to bed. Again, thank you very much. You're welcome. - Good night. - Good night. - Sleep well. - Yes. Right, my friend. Let's do some straight talking. Why did Benda want to talk to you alone? - What do you mean? - Come on. I've been in this business long enough. Don't beat around the bush. What do you want, Bruno? I don't want to be the fool in the dark. I won't tell you. Alright. But I will tell you that tomorrow you have the honor of accompanying me. Where to? Kreuzberg. First of May. The Reds want to demonstrate and we'll stop them. Yes. Special operation. Comb houses, search flats for weapons. Pure harassment. The real dirty work. - Maybe have a shot after all? - No, thanks. Doesn't go with that. With what? With stupid questions. I'd like to know what you're about. Dear Helga, thank you for your letter which I received yesterday. It is good to know that everything is alright at home. Here, it's not that simple. I don't want to alarm you... but I still can't tell you for sure when I'll come home. Unforeseen incidences have stopped me from speedily fulfilling my tasks for the foreseeable future. If I look at the hustle and bustle around me, I think of our dreams, and I feel a kind of hope I hadn't known before. The hope that we will find a way out of this secrecy... out of this secretiveness. Well? Dance some more tonight? Not tonight. Maybe tomorrow, who knows. Maybe even here in Berlin. Please think about it. And say hi to the boy from me. With best regards, yours, Gereon. Is that Kardakov? No. BERLIN DIRECTORY 1929 He's still here. In your room. Is that you? What is this, Alexey? Where have you been? What are you doing here? What the hell is going on? Go on, let's get him. Drive! Turn the car around! Leave me alone! What do you want? Get in! - Let me go! - That's enough! Help me, help me! Help! Help me! Help me! You have to help me, please! Help me! Do you want one too? Yes. - Have you seen the man before? - I don't know. He may have been one of them when they were meeting here. Excuse me. Who? The Russians. Sometimes there were quite a lot of them. Then it got noisy. Politics. In your room. Who was in there before me? Kardakov was his name. He was a violinist, actually. But when he really got talking... I didn't understand a word, but if he had said, jump! I would have jumped. He had something... Sometimes it was uncanny. - The suitcase in my room? - Yes, that's his. Sorry, he meant to pick it up yesterday. I'll take it to the basement tomorrow, and that one too. Where did Kardakov go? On tour, for six months. With a whole orchestra. On a cruise ship. All the way to the Bosporus, he said. Then why did he leave his instrument here? A mysterious guy. Sometimes he told me... He was on the other side in the war, not on ours. "They fell... like bees in the freezing cold," he said. I once dreamt that it was him who shot my Helmut. And that the Lord sent him to me. What a lot of nonsense. Were you in the war? I followed my brother to the front. Then I came back alone. So you know what it's like. To wake up in the morning... alone. To hate the silence, and the birds too. All that false peace. My mother couldn't cope. For her, the wrong son returned home. I'll take the suitcase down tomorrow, if you'll allow me. Good night. Good night. Clashes with the Berlin police have already been reported. At this hour, KPD activists are handing out flyers in Wedding and Kreuzberg. These say that the ban on demonstrations was lifted. This is not true. Tomorrow, on May First, demonstrations are still banned. - Can't you sleep? - How, with this racket? Likely that violence will escalate, emphasized Chief of Police... I'm sorry. - Was the radio on? - Yes! - What was on? - I don't know, something political. Oh please, let's listen to it. Do you have any idea how late it is? I have to be up early! Come on, I'll make you a sandwich and we'll listen to it together. You translate. Like in the old days! Emerge stronger from the election campaign so that they keep working for the best of our fatherland. Now you will hear Gustav Mahler's Rückert Lieder and I Am Lost To The World. - Music. - With singing? Well then. A woman is singing... I am lost To the world With which I had spoiled A lot of time For a long time It hasn't heard from me It may well think That I have died And it doesn't matter to me Alright now, nice and easy. Tell us what your plan was. I don't know what you mean. Your plan? The Red Fortress. Your Fourth International. - What were you up to? - I don't know what you're talking about. I really don't know. I'm a railway worker. There is no point in lying. We know who you are. What did you want at Kardakov's place? What is the Red Fortress planning to do? What's in Istanbul? What's your plan? Talk. Talk! Why Istanbul? Trotsky is there. That much I know. But I don't know anything else. I was just supposed to meet Kardakov at the train. Honestly! Kardakov is dead. But he was friendly enough to leave us this. The Red Fortress... sends a train to Trotsky, to Istanbul. Tell us why. Why are you sending him a train? Why to Istanbul? Talk! What's on that train? What's in that wagon? Tell us. What? A lot of gold. Gold? What gold? The Kulaks' gold, stolen from the museums? What gold, my boy? It's the Sorokins' gold. To ashes, to dust Stolen from the light But not yet now Miracles wait until the end Ocean of time Eternal law To ashes, to dust To ashes But not yet now It must be just a dream Trying to snatch the wind Who really knows? The clock on your wall It is filled with sand Put your hand in mine And let us be forever Now you make your choice And throw us in between happiness and agony But I can forgive you You are very close to death But your eye still clear Does it recognize me? I'm ready To seek immortality with you
