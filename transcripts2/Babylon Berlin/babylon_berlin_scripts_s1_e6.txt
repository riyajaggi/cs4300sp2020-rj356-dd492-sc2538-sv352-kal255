 Previously on Babylon Berlin. And this is what happened to us in Oranienstrasse. The official version. "Some of the communists were shooting at myself and Detective Rath." Are you serious? No-one is writing "the police were attacked." But we'd need proof. An injured policeman. They only ever made one copy of each of König's films. The courier always took them. Krajewski? He used to be one of us.

 A police officer. He honestly thought he could just go back to working after the war. The snazzy guy from Cologne. He's a bit too curious for my liking. What's he to do with me? Find out what he's looking for. Must have got under a car. He wasn't a tough guy, I realized that too late. - You want to investigate? - It's not that easy. Pretending to be police and breaking into a flat is not a mistake. - It's worse. You lied to me. - I did not. By the way, Kardakov was still there last night. - Where, in Berlin? - In Sorokina's flat. So he really didn't leave the city.

 What do you want from me? The Sorokins' gold. Where is the gold from? From Russia. And what do you want to use it for? Mr. Kardakov. Stretch it once more. Move it. - Done, Edgar. - Thank you, doctor. My country is doomed. I must help prevent this. That's what I need the gold for. I promise... this deal will be more than worth your while. Please. Help me. Gereon? Are you alive yet? Oh, pardon. Désolé! Dobré ráno. Scusi. Fancy a newspaper? "Police officer close to death, communists continue to deny." A question at an inopportune time? Yes. This colleague of yours, that Dörr guy, who was shot during the Communists' demonstration. Would have been... Is alleged to... Could have been... Anyway, it's all becoming a tearjerker. So I thought... POLICE OFFICER CLOSE TO DEATH COMMUNISTS CONTINUE TO DENY! Maybe you could tell me which section the guy belongs to? So I can find out his address. At the press conference they were as silent as monks. I don't know... I don't even know him. Well... Just in case you came across something and would hand me such details, as soon as they came around the corner... - You're championing the sub... - Subjunctive. Would come, could, would. German grammar. Fantastic, isn't it? I'm also a police officer, Mr. Katelbach. But a good one. I thought it may be worth revealing the truth about 1 May. Don't you want that? - What makes you say that? - I can tell from looking at you. Either way, in exchange, I would have tickets for the Plumpe. You what? The stadium on Gesundbrunnen. Hertha BSC versus Holstein Kiel. "A hand is washed only by the other" in this city. You'd think! In sites of civilization, in your beautiful city on the Rhine, or in my modest home town on the Danube, friends help each other. Only the Berliners don't get it. That's terrible. What's the time? Seven. Dear God. It's Sunday. ACADEMIC ROWING CLUB LAKE WANNSEE - What are you writing? - A novel. Want to go out on the boat? - Just the two of us? - Yes. I'd love to. You look droll in your swimming dress. Where did you get it? At the carpet shop? - No, she looks like a walrus. - Legs don't look slim in that. No, here on your forehead. Give it to me. How does this work? - Look. - That won't stick. - No, like this. - Hey, sporting ace. But it won't stick. Here, on your forehead like this. Like this, look. Hello. Greta, Rudi. Rudi, Greta. - Hi. - Hi. - What about the first swim? - I've been in already. Shame. Come on, Stefan. Show us what you got. Stand over there. Come on. I beg your pardon? That's silly. - Far enough? - Yes. And now you tell her something. In a normal voice. Don't shout. Oh, it's cold. That much? Find out for yourselves, churchy types. Who is he? A nitwit. So, what did I say? Ten Saxon revelers pay twelve Czech checks. What about me? Why does Jänicke bring proles to the club? - Right? - Yes. How do you do it? - He can lip-read. His father is blind. - Deaf, you moron. Not bad. And, do you like him? What makes you say that? - Well... - Let's race! Mixed fours. - Coming! - Coming! Three... two... Mass executions are a legitimate tool of the revolution. Says who? Hitler? Lenin. Expropriation, too, by the way. In nomine patris et filii et spiritus sancti Amen Mr. Rath. - Glad you could make it. - Mr. Councillor. Oh please. Today, the councillor is also a civilian, just like you. Irmgard, this is Mr. Rath, the colleague from Cologne. - Nice to meet you. - Did mass uplift you? Be careful with what you say. Thank you, it was beautiful. A little... different from the Rhine area. You mean... more composed? Maybe. Well, the Märkisch diaspora. We're having guests for coffee later, if you would like to come? Thank you, but I have work to do. I'll give you the day off. Then I'd love to. You'll let the inspector go first, ok? Go ahead. - After you? - Me? Oh, it's not for me. It's not my club. My husband's family is Jewish and he refuses to get baptized. In the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, amen. Amen. God's eternal mercy will always forgive you, my son. I know. Talk to me, my son. After the first step, the second one is easy. If you don't want to, come back some other time. The doors of this house are always open to you. I love my brother's wife. Does he know? No. He is lost without a trace. Missing. Has this led to indecent actions? Yes. Over a long period of time? For over ten years now. This is a heavy burden. The ninth commandment is an important component of our Christian integrity. Is there more, my son? JOB POSTING Have you talked to Stefan about the job yet? Hey, Stefan! I didn't know you personally know Benda. Sure, he's the chief of the political police. - See? - I have an interview tomorrow. Good! Hey, student! Me? No. - What are you reading then? - Pardon? What are you reading? Just looking at pictures. - Are you from Usedom? - No, Darss. And you? - Wismar? - No. Stralsund. Hey, what are you doing? That's not your boat. We are the Kiel sailors. We're doing revolution. You can't do that! - Come along. Read to us. - No way. Help! - Quick! Help! - Let's go, guys. - They're stealing our boat! - Kidnapping! Wait, I'll get you! Faster! - What are you doing? - Help me! - I'm being kidnapped! - You'll have to endure it! We're rid of them. - I'm Fritz. - Greta. Greta. Nice name. Otto. Hello. Cold, but fair. Listen... - You're in medical school, right? - Forensic pathology with Dr. Schwarz. Do you cut open bodies and look into them? That's almost all we do. - Seriously? - Sure. I cut them open in my sleep. Why do you want to know? Just do. Maybe the two of us are up to something later. I see. Please help yourself. I'm sorry, but our maid was married off over night. - Can I help you? - No, thank you. A woman doesn't unlearn this. Rath, there you are. Have you met our chief employer? We haven't been introduced. Chief of police Zörgiebel, Inspector Rath from Cologne. I am honored. Rath, the son of Engelbert? You owe me a report for the first of May. I'm working on it. The fact that you were shot at, the danger... the self-defense situation you and your colleague were in, you have to emphasize that. I expect your written statement regarding those events tomorrow morning. You're shaking. I'm cold, too. We need help! You can't go there. I can. Just like that. - Pardon? - The constabularies. That's where they were shooting from. And they were dead. But no revolution, the party says. What are you doing here? - Mr. Nowak. - Are you snooping around? - I'm sorry. - He's one of them. - A copper? - Yes. - What did he say? - A copper? - Get out. - A policeman? - A policeman? - Get out, murderer. - Murderer. - Get out. Hands off. Get lost, you bastard. Come on, let it go. Come on. Next time I'll kill you. Honored guests, dear comrades, I welcome you all here in the ancestral home of our family. I'm particularly happy that the lady of the house is joining us today. The general director Annemarie Nyssen. Mother. Hunting is the actual passion of man, apart from war. Today we welcome the esteemed personal advisor of the President of the Reich, Colonel Wendt, and also one of the great heroes of the previous war, the conqueror of Memel, and the hero of the Battle of Heidekrug, Major General Seegers. How come the Soviets suddenly put a hold on the delivery in Berlin? The embassy's Bolshevik is talking of some sort of... I don't know. Some kind of smuggling, allegedly. On Monday, the wagons will be searched. What? Why wait until Monday? Think of the freight. You can't just open the hatches. You must make sure that this train doesn't cause any kind of publicity. - My name is on the freight papers. - Exactly. Anything that happens to this transport between the national border and the Reichswehr's barracks is solely your responsibility. You know this. And you knew it when you agreed to support the national cause. Do you know what's at stake for me when this gets out? Exactly. That's why the train shouldn't stop here for long. Once the press or even the police hears of our... I mean your activities, you won't just put yourself in jeopardy, but the entire enterprise. Give the Russians whatever they want. We'll do the rest. Right. And now pull yourself together. We are much obliged to the Nyssen family and in particular your mother for making her estate available to us. And we want to see what Colonel Wendt has prepared for us. When and where is the exercise to take place? After dark, General. In a valley behind those... hills. Oh, well. So we've got some time. Too far. I beg your pardon, Major General. I couldn't resist. 200 meters are ambitious for you, too. On the contrary. We look forward to your exercise, Colonel. At the second address on our list in Oranienstrasse around number eight there were two women on a balcony. Shortly afterwards, several men unfurled a red flag, four by six meters in size. At the same time, the communists opened fire. Rath. Who is this? Hello? Hello? This is Germany's hope. How many men are there? Four thousand. It's a very special exercise. Is it? We're calling it "Operation Prangertag". That picture... We downed a few bottles, Helmut got on the horse, straight down into the basement inn. To the bar. Bruno? May I interrupt? I'll be right back. Today's the anniversary of Helmut's death. He was in my company. Fell in the battle of Zillebeke. He was a good one. Old Behnke. Bruno. I need your help. König? Finally. I have to find Krajewski. He's the key. Let's go then. What do you want? I need my stuff. Whom do you give the material from the film lab? Which material? They'll finish me off, man. Where's the film? Patience. We have time. He doesn't. Now you'll see how long you can manage without drugs. If you need anything, you'll call for service. This officer will come get us. Look. This is what I have for you when you sing. That's... too weak for me. - I... need something stronger. - I see. I thought it was just the thing for you shaking chickens. I need something stronger. Please! As you can see, even broken machines can think. No doubt about that. You're living proof of that. And with your stuff... you have a grip on yourself? You tell me. You know me by now. If this gets out... - you're out, no debate. - Do you think I'm a bad policeman? Come on. Let me give you a kiss. You're my favorite policeman. You're the best policeman... I'm serious. Idiot. You're the idiot. Because you didn't trust me. Man, I'm parched. Come on. Another two hours. Hello? - Hands up! - What's going on? - Hand over your weapons. - Lie down. - Get down. - Go on, get down. Lie down. - Yes. - Let's go. Come with me. It's gas. Gas! Gas! It's gas! Let's go. Everyone out! Go on, get out! - Get to safety! - Everyone out! Get out! Put gas masks on! Freeze! Come over here. We need to take him. Chin up! Let's get out of here. Quick! Paramedics! Hold on! Hold on! Is this the dead Russian? Yes. Will you close the door, please? You take the feet, they're still firm. Isn't he a bit heavy? Yes, you're right. I'll let some gas out first. Oh, crap. Hold your nose. - What? - Close your mouth! AMMONIUM SALT Kiss me. Better? And now? First we'll cause some carnage and then I'll show you my pad. You'd like that, wouldn't you? Go straight to Dr. Schmidt. Right, miss, we're about to start. Just a second. Black mamba, but a proper one. - What does that mean? - Come here, take a look. Here. Charcoal lungs. This guy was either a miner or a railway worker. He can't have been a miner. Not with hands like this. Oh, crap. Help me. Are they nuts? Take me out of the opera? I had to go through the rows. We could have done this tomorrow. We'd have cooled him. - And now? - In there. The clothes! I don't go to the opera for that! Hurry up, they're coming. Come on. I don't need that. They're idiots, I won't go to the opera again. There was a chemical accident tonight. One wagon of my train exploded. At Anhalter freight yard. - Railway. - Were you at the front line? 123rd infantry division. Why? I've seen this a thousand times. Looks much like a gas attack. Let's check the lungs for warfare agents. Russian railway worker. Gas attack. Anhalter freight yard. Well, inspector? So, everything alright? Yes. - All the ladies are registered? - Sure. Then we're all good. You know it. A model establishment. Give my regards to the boss. The medication issue really got the inspector's back up. You promised. What? The certificate of conduct. Spotless. Someone's got to find your paper first. I want to join the police, Bruno. But why? Because I know I'd be good. At investigating? Yes. Why don't you investigate the sleuth then? Then you'll get your certificate of conduct. The Cologne guy didn't do it. But someone went through my desk. The day before yesterday. His condition is unstable. The train is full of gold. Only Svetlana knows. Get some rest. The train is full... Increase the dose. Six milligrams morphine. And, will he make it? Yes. Why did you believe that man? I know him. He wouldn't lie. Comrades! Attention! To ashes, to dust Stolen from the light But not yet now Miracles wait until the end It must be just a dream Trying to snatch the wind Who really knows? The clock on your wall It is filled with sand Put your hand in mine And let us be forever Now you make your choice
