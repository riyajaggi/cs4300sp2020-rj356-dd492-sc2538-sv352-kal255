 Even in the darkness of my dungeon... Even in the darkness of my dungeon... I know your strict hand is above me. I know your strict hand is above me. Your wrath is deserved. Your wrath is deserved. Your revenge is terrible. Your revenge is terrible. I'm sorry, but when a picture is so ruined... If you had the negative, I could work with that. But I don't have it. Was it a professional photographer, I mean cameraman? Why? It's very thinly lit. It's a miracle you can see anything at all. It was taken secretly. Very well. When it's finished, where may I deliver it to, Inspector? I'll take it now. - And, Mr... - Gräf. Don't tell anyone about this. You have never seen this picture. Gereon. I have something for you. Well, our 14 is on the ball. Went down the shaft right away. Barrel calibrated and cleaned, everything spick-and-span. Bruno, we could interrogate the man together. I won't get involved. Don't worry. One has to let Polly out of jail. I'm off. Where is the film? Come on, blackmail is a little ambitious for you. Tell me who your clients are, where the film is, and you can go. I need some fresh air. Please. I can't breathe. Very good idea. And now? Close your eyes. And then? You won't get out of here. Not alive. Close your eyes. Think about it, König. We're not after you. - You have nothing to worry about. - Close your eyes! No. GENTS GENTS What happened? Can you hear me? What? I can't understand. Inside pocket. This? Do you want this? How much? One? Good? I'll get help. Please. But you are bleeding. It's not mine. Am I wrong here or is it you? Do you how many men's restrooms there are in headquarters? Fifty-two. And how many ladies'? May I ask you a favor? - You don't have to. I get it. - You do? I'm Charlotte Ritter. - Rath, Gereon. - Gereon? Where are you from, the Middle Ages? From Cologne. I'll manage on my own. Are you sure? Yes. Alright. I'll close the door, OK? Drive on, please. Do you have the papers? Very good. CONSIGNMENT NOTE You have to put the number of the car here. AB 32-2-1. And here the destination station. Istanbul. Everyone at the printer's is ready. Tomorrow, a new chapter will begin for the Russian people. And you made it possible. And you will finish it. Kardakov... I love you. And I you. A call to Cologne. Thirteen-zero-eight. Thank you. Hello? It's me. - G ereon? - Can you talk? Yes. König is dead. - Do you have the material? - No. - Just one single picture. - What? No film? Not yet. You know about your responsibility. You must destroy the film. Nobody can know it exists. Gereon. Man, where have you been? What happened? He grabbed my gun. - They're expecting us. - Who are they? The political department. - Benda? - In person. Come on. Yes, I understand. Yes, of course. Goodbye. - Wolter, Rath. He's expecting us. - Please. Councillor. How could you let this happen? You knew König. You were sent here because you've been trailing this guy for weeks. You must have known what he's capable of. The inspector has not acted negligently... Nobody is asking you, Wolter! You interrogated him yesterday. Together with the chief inspector. Yesterday afternoon. - And the wounds? - Pardon? This file here says that König arrived at the detention center with injuries. How come? He tried to resist arrest by escaping. Please excuse us, gentlemen. Mr. Wolter, in private, please. Take a seat, inspector. It would be disastrous in your position to keep something from me. I am aware of that. I phoned Cologne earlier. Your father told me you would explain everything. The Lord Mayor of Cologne is being blackmailed. Dr. Adenauer. My most senior employer. The affair is unsavory. To be dealt with before the elections. Blackmailed. By König? I knew König. A stuck-up, arrogant chap. Until this morning. - He was changed. A different guy. - Meaning? I think there is a contracting entity. Here in Berlin. Where is this film? Do you have any leads yet? Yes. Good. Don't lose any time. And as far as the incident with König is concerned, leave the apparatus in the castle, the press and Wolter to me. - Cigarette? - Please. Your father mentioned you have a personal connection with Dr. Adenauer? My mother died immediately after the war. From Spanish flu. Dr. Adenauer took good care of the concerns of the family. He was a strong support for both my father and me during a very difficult time. Where do you stay, Rath? Nowhere since this morning, my hotel is fully booked. We'll take care of it. - Are you Catholic? - Yes. Do come to mass on Sunday. St Antonius in Friedenau. - I play the organ. - I'd love to. And Mr. Wolter, please provide our colleague with accommodation. - Long-term. - Will do. - Behnke speaking. - El isabeth. It's Bruno. I need a room. - For when? - Immediately, ideally. The balcony room has just been vacated. I need to prepare it. That's good. It's for a colleague of mine. Thanks, Bruno. Send the gentleman over, the room will be ready in two hours. ALEXEY KARDAKOV EVERY FRIDAY JULY TO SEPTEMBER 1928 It's six marks a week. If you pay for a whole month, it's cheaper. Elisabeth will explain it all to you. - Who? - Behnke, your landlady. She's the widow of a mate. Jänicke? Now go to your new pad. And tomorrow come over for dinner at ours. Alright, thanks. - Chief? - Can you drive? - I beg your pardon? - Drive a car? Vroom, vroom? Yes. Staff car. Take this suitcase and this inspector to 25 Bayreuther St. You'll bring the car back washed. Yes, sir. Why are you still standing here looking helpless? Go. It's great that everything runs so smoothly around here. - Let me take that. - Thanks. - Please take me to Hermannplatz first. - Right now? Yes, please. - I'm with Wolter. - Alright. Rabbit boy. Want to warm up some? - Copper. - So? They're cold too. - Where's the other one? - It's my shift. Come with me. - Have you heard? - Sure. Stuff like that spreads like wildfire. König wasn't a guy who would kill himself. Who is afraid that König would spill? The... emperor? König was a mystery-monger. No one knew for whom he was doing those films. But he made good money. Where did you record this? Who are the women? - This one, I know her. - Which one? This one. That's... Mutti from Wedding. SOVIET EMBASSY MITTE, BERLIN Hello. Follow me. Who is the leader of the group? ALEXEY KARDAKOV Alexey Kardakov. Consider it done. On behalf of the Soviet government... I thank you for your help. Comrade General. We managed to identify the leader of the group. Alexey Kardakov. - Take this. - No, I'm OK. Take it. I'm going to Istanbul tomorrow where it's warm. Thanks. We also know where the counterrevolutionaries meet. I have already arranged for it, Comrade General. Thank you, Jänicke. Come on in. Breakfast is at half six, dinner is extra. That's at six. Warm on Sundays and Wednesdays, sandwiches the other days. I'll do the bed linen, but you have to take care of towels and stuff. You can use the balcony as you wish, but please air the room regularly. - Well, if that's not lucky. - Are you superstitious? - No. You? - No. - I'll take the room. - On a weekly or monthly basis? - Weekly. - Fine. I need an advance for the first three weeks. Mr. Katelbach! Excuse me. - Mr. Katelbach? - Yes? Have you looked at the calendar? End of the month. One more day and you're moving out. Dear Ms. Elisabeth, I have something very special for you. In three hours, a special show at the Admiralspalast. A jazz opera like the other day? No. You're not airing the room. I promise you, you'll love it. Sell your complimentary tickets, I want my rent. You'll get your money, when I'm back from Vienna. Vienna again? Who is paying for this trip? My publisher, of course. The government in Vienna wants to make a guy from the Middle Ages chancellor - and revive the corporative state... - When will you pay? As soon as my commentary is printed, you'll get your money. What if it doesn't get printed? That, dear Ms. Elisabeth, is a conjunctivus irrealis, an impossibility. However, would it be possible in return to have some of that delicious... First pay, then eat. Said the executioner to the delinquent. I bid you goodbye. Your respectful servant. Good day. A journalist? - An Austrian snot. - What's on the menu? Dumplings. - And at ours? - What do you think? - Black pudding. - With or without? Without you? That would be nice. Get going, we need briquettes. Bloody bitches. Jesus, Karlchen, get on the bench! Do I have to write it on your forehead? Now! What's up with you going off over nothing today? - Haven't slept all night. - Why not? Mother was coughing, Erich was puking, Grandpa wet the bed, Toni was crying, Magda was yelling, Karlchen had diarrhea. - And Lotte wasn't home, as always. - But I got the sausage. - And how was school today? - It was nothing. - You didn't actually go, right? - I did. - You were at the spinning mill. - Just a few hours. They needed someone. - How much? - One fifty. - Who has it? - Ilse, of course. If you go to work, you won't keep up in school. Finished. As good as new, madam. Don't distract, madam. - Dolly. - Yes, Mother? You need to rub some rubbing alcohol on me. Grandpa! Your money and very soon we own the world! Banks eat up your money and very soon we own the world! Banks eat up your money and very soon we own the world... - Good evening, Charlotte. - Good evening. Thank you. Hello there. Put some in? Thank you. It has to be you. Oh, Saint Gereon of Cologne. - Good evening, Mr. Döhmann. - Robert, do me a favor and leave your master alone with the inspector. Go buy some cigarettes or something and flip the sign over, OK? - Will do. - Good. Well then. So, when are you going back home? Soon. I'm hoping you have that prescription for me. Thank you. Yeah, yeah, you're lucky, you still have hope. I'll probably be amongst those frigid Berlin broads until the end of my life. What have I done to deserve this? Just because I married a girl from Charlottenburg. How could I be so stupid? They pretend to be swinging, but compared to a proper Cologne bird you can forget them all. Here. Ten milligrams max. Orally. That's two per day. No more. Or you'll get addicted. I just want some rest. Rest, at your age? You should be ashamed. - Have a nice evening. - Yes, you too. What the heck is this? Now look here, old chap. Those broads. Look around. They're everywhere. Broads over broads. - You don't know where to look. - I do. That one? Is that your bird? Well, I wouldn't say that, but... But she doesn't know it yet, right? Hold this. Hey. A little soda? - Thanks. - My friend sends me. - Oh yeah, I know him. - He feels unable to. But you don't? - Does he dance? - Why, of course. Hold these. Hey, what else can I do for you? Please welcome Le Grand Nikoros. Bye, you were wonderful. Come on. - I have to see you again. - Definitely.
