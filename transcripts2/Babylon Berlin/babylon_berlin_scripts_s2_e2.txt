 Previously on Babylon Berlin. The dead man belonged to a Russian resistance organization. The 15 bodies from the pine forest were all members of this Red Fortress. Inspector Rath has found a freight document which implicates the group in a politically charged smuggle case. How did you know about this freight yard? For years I have been trying to free my family's treasure from Stalin's claws. Your train was my last chance. - Have you seen the freight? - Yes. Call the Charité hospital so they come and get her. - Why? - They'll take her for free.

 Is wrong with me Is wrong with you I don't know what is wrong with me And how do you feel? I, I, I I'm in the mood for you I was in the mood for you yesterday I will always be in the mood for you Moritz. - Moritz. - I know the score. About what? About you two. I know you pretend there is nothing going on. I know you have to keep it secret from Grandpa Engelbert. Because he would kill you, or do something bad. I know you've always sneaked into mum's bed, when you think I'm asleep. I know you're both afraid, and you're lying. Moritz! It's not about that. Actually, we wanted to tell you something else, which we have known deep inside for a long time. Your father is no longer missing. He won't be coming back, Moritz. At some point he will come. - No, not anymore. - Yes! Listen! He is dead. You're lying. You both are. I know he'll come back. I know he's alive. And you? You don't even want us here. Oh. CERTIFICATE OF CONDUCT That's it? - Just the one page? - Yes. And record of the other day when I went into the flat? Never happened. Thank you. - Lotte? - Here. You're wanted. Yes, I'm... I'm coming. You're still carrying on? I need money. Great that you could accommodate us, Chief Constable. If the personal advisor of the President of the Reich takes the time, then... the matter must be of importance. Believe me, I wouldn't have troubled you, if the matter wasn't extremely urgent. Gerti! Gertchen, you have to help me. What's up? I have a customer. You have to help me! No! This is not the end of the world Stranded in life and art I have a message for you. The President of the Reich appreciates the way you dealt with the May 1 demonstrators. But the matter is not yet ridden out. - My department could help you. - We'll see. - Sir, would you like a drink? - Thank you, not right now. I'll do that. That's my table. Go smoke a cigarette. - With local politics. - Why? Just because. The Soviet government has already contacted the President of the Reich. - That's why we are here. - Who, Stalin? - In person. - The matter is simple. Your confiscation of the train causes tensions between the Soviet Union and the German Reich. But the President of the Reich doesn't want any tension. Full stop. I like to help. Then release the train. And what happens with the freight? It'll go back to where it came from. That you Soviets are eager to help build up the illegal Reichswehr is a matter in itself. But that even our head of state doesn't shy away from ignoring the Treaty of Versailles, that is... astonishing. We just have to return a misrouted delivery of pesticides. Please don't make it more complicated than it is. Why should such a relevant piece of evidence leave our country? Mr. Zörgiebel. It's in your hands if the sudden end of your career will be associated with the death of many demonstrators... or not. Tell me, miss. Do I know you? I beg your pardon? We have met. - Yes, in here probably. - No. Well, then you're mistaking me. I have a photographic memory. Maybe you've seen a picture of me. No? -Hello. - Morning. Morning. Charlotte? Good morning. I'm sorry. I need to... I urgently need to talk to you. I think you need some coffee first. - Come on. - Yes. So, why can these people put so much pressure on Zörgiebel? After all, he's the chief of police. And you are sure it was the Russian from the freight yard? Very sure. Have you slept at all? - You look a little tired. - Don't worry. Alright then. Let's go back to work. Are you coming? Yes. - You should get some rest. - Yeah, right. At home. I'm fine. Just for a tiny moment, I felt a bit... queer. So, what do you want me to do? Go home and go to bed. - But why can't I... - Enough. Mr. Wendt. Colonel! What do you want from me? I was privileged to witness almost all of your successes in the past years. To me, you're a hero. - Get to the point. - A German hero. You and I, we both strive for the same goal. We both want men like you to have the standing that is their due, in leading a strong, proud Germany. Your irresponsible actions have done considerable damage to our cause. I myself was duped. I'm not the man to restore your reputation. And I will personally see to it that this disastrous train is sent back to Russia as soon as possible. - And now excuse me. - But you mustn't. Everything would be lost. You might want to strive for a bit of clarity for a change, Mr. Nyssen. I know the real reason the Soviets want that train back so urgently. And what would that be? There is gold on that train. They did spot checks. They all contained phosgene. Only one of the wagons has that freight, and I know its number. I won't be causing a diplomatic scandal because of you. I hope you know that. You won't have to. The value of the treasure is at least one billion Reichsmark. Half of it would be for you, and the movement. - And what are they supposed to do? - Intercept the train in open terrain and seize the wagon. We mustn't leave this treasure to the Bolsheviks. I'll be in touch. Look at this. That bitch. I asked her for a dress when we got married. No, she said, I've taken mine to the Jew. Hey, you. What's the matter? - What about this, should we keep it? - No. Chuck it. I'm sick of it. I don't believe the stuff she kept. Look at this. The stuff she had! This and this... Here, an embroidered handkerchief. Throw it in the corner. What are you doing? The good into the pot, the bad into the crop. Mother is lying there and you're robbing her stuff? - Not me. - If you can afford to let her valuables go to waste. I've got mouths to feed. You? - What valuables are you talking about? - This dress. Top-notch pre-war goods. The Jew will give me two fivers for that. But I'm here too, and Toni. Just because she didn't leave you anything for shacking up with that bum. Listen to her. I'm the eldest. This is my compulsory portion. - No! - Let go. Right, Daddy, up with your bones. - Let go! - Please stop. - I said let go. - Ilse! - What is this? - This is my dress! - I said let go! - What are you doing? He's sitting on a cushion. I want to know what's underneath. Help me. Leave granddad alone. Stop it! Granddad! Are you nuts? Are you out of your mind, you bastard? Granddad? Toni, come help me. No one touches Granddad. Not you, and you neither. COLONIAL GOODS OILS AND FATS, CHOCOLATE, COFFEE AND TEE - Hello. - Hello. - Two black puddings, please. - Here you are. One small, one big. - Thank you. - Five marks and thirty. - Fritz! - Hi, doll. What are you doing here? Did you know one of them? That's not the point. Come along. I can't. I have to work. Then tell those murderers at home what you saw. The murderers? What do you mean? What do you think, who offed those comrades? The massacre on 1 May? - Mr. Benda? - Who else? Get in line. Fritz! Inspector? Forensics confirmed the calibre of the dead from the pine forest. Here, it's the Russian model. 7.62 Tokarev. Fired from two separate weapons, both of the same calibre. But the great thing is, there are just two registrations of this weapon. And they were registered last week. Selenski, Pyotr. Fallin, Mikhail. They both belong to the Soviet embassy. And both weapons were taken at our train. The gas train? - We'll arrest them. - They've tried several times. But investigations were stopped, they have diplomatic status. Why did they try to arrest them? They like a bit of illegal gambling. Illegal betting on dogs. Two marks on the brown one. The brown one is it. Two marks. Go on, get him. Ten marks on that one! Go on! Go on, get him! Those two? Police! This is a raid. Game over. Look! Who are they? What's going on? If you take part in illegal dog betting, you commit a crime. - Give me your weapon. - I said, what do you want? I'm sorry, Inspector, I'm a member of the consulate of Soviet Russia. I know. You're arrested for illegal possession of firearms - and 15 cases of murder. - What? Stop! Stop! BERLIN POLICE RECORDS DEPARTMENT - Charlotte. - Hello. - What's the matter? - I didn't want to disturb you. You're not disturbing me. Come on in. Good evening, I'm a work colleague of your son's. I can't... - My parents can't hear you. - Please. Good evening, Mr. Jänicke. Do you want to eat something? Soup. We've got them. - Who? - The murderers from the printer's. From the Red Fortress. That's good then. Did something happen? - What's he saying? - Nothing. He is asking if you need a bed for the night. Well, if that's possible... Just for a few hours, I'll be gone again immediately. No problem. You can have my bed. I'll take the sofa. I have to get up early anyway. It's very tasty. I'm ok, thanks. Get yourself a radio by tomorrow. 23 MAY, 2 P.M., 709 KHZ The number of this wagon... Strategic point outside the city, some 50 kilometers... The route leaves the south of the city... If we manage at 127 kilometers... in direction of Wünsdorf... Hey, did you steal that? What? Are you nuts? It's mine. A thief! This man stole a Panorama! - Take your hands off me. - This man stole a Panorama! A thief! He stole a Panorama! A thief! - Benda. - Hi, it's Stefan Jänicke. - I need to talk to your husband. - I'm sorry. My husband is rarely home at this hour. Madam, it is of the utmost importance. I've already tried the Castle, in vain. Please tell me where to find the Councillor. I'm sorry, the Councillor didn't inform me of his whereabouts. - Goodbye. - Bye. What are these? They are pictures of 15 bodies we found a few days ago. Taken out of the city and buried deeply. But not deep enough. What do you want from me? I want to cause trouble for you. And as much trouble as 15 murdered activists and two... confessed agents of your embassy can cause you. Fifteen executed revolutionaries of the Red Fortress. The railway worker who drove the train here, also Red Fortress. I don't know why you're stealing my time. We confiscated the weapons of these gentlemen. There were projectiles from those guns in almost all of the bodies. Tokarev 7.62. Russian replicas. Exclusively for the members of your secret service. What do you want? I want to propose a deal. Why should I do deals with the Berlin police? Because if you don't, your head office in Moscow will call you back. There you and your imprudent staff will be put up against the wall. If this massacre becomes public knowledge, it would most likely mean your death sentence at home. You know that. What's your offer? I want the names of those responsible of the Reichswehr who organize the transport of the poison gas and have been secretly rebuilding the German army for years. Names and proof. You want me to deliver your own countrymen? Yes. The top 15 ranks will do. In exchange, those 15 patriots who met with an accident in exile will go home to Mother Russia "A hand is washed by the other." You'll have nothing to fear as far as we're concerned. We won't investigate those deaths. Keep the change. I demand good work, understood? Thank you. Goodbye. Thank you. Do you want to go up and see your folks? Shall I take you to the Castle? - Wolter, I've been looking for you. - Hey, Böhm. All well? A simple question. What were you and your friend from Cologne doing at the Pepita Bar on Thursday? We yodeled. With all the frills. Wipe that grin off your face. Answer my question! We had a drink. - With Saint Josef? - Saint Josef? At Pepita? Nope. Hey, Jänicke, I deciphered the telegram. You? On your own? Czerwinsky has been a master of Russian since he was born. I am Balt, so I am masterful. "Uncle just passed the border, present on its way to Berlin." Inspector Rath should get this today. Deputy inspector Jänicke. Where is your superior? - Pardon? - Your superior, where is he? - Out. - How dare he interfere with my case? Tell him he is in for it tomorrow morning. Nine o'clock at Gennat's. Always refreshing, is Böhm. I think I should let the inspector know. Take it to his home tonight. To Wolter's? The police estate, opposite the old Lux factory. Excuse me. - Can I borrow your radio for a few days? - Definitely. What's going on? Our landlady has been unbearable - since you told her you're moving out. - Has she? I can't even speculate that this has to do with the sudden appearance of your sweetheart. - You're making progress? - Yes. This is going to be my own personal ode to our esteemed Chief of Police Karl-Friedrich Zörgiebel. Your new employer. He didn't like your article. That's what they say at the Castle. There. The right-wing postils have bombarding us for days with this slush. The injured police officer... A HERO RETURNS HOME finally goes home to wife and child. Would work for you, too. - Have you found the officer? - Yes. And the wife, the almost-widow, and the child. And I went to the hospital, too. Hello, Mrs. Dörr. You don't know me, Katelbach. I'm an acquaintance of your husband's. And the evil communist alleged to have shot him has just turned three. You're not serious. It's all in there. And tomorrow in the Weltbühne. Good luck. And see you soon. How soon? Still uncertain. That's worse than you think. You only just started to become bearable. I'll be in touch. You'll have your device back in a week at the latest. Definitely. Elisabeth? Elisabeth? One second, Inspector. Where did you get my address from? The investigation against the Chief of Police was dropped. The families of the dead want to start civil proceedings. - Against the despotism of the police. - You can't just jump on me like this. You saw the women on Oranienstrasse die. You saw the men who shot at the women. I didn't see anything. The widower told me you had gone back to the flat. To the balcony. Why? You just have to testify that the two women were unarmed. That there were no fighters or weapons hidden in their flat. That will do. It would help a lot. I won't blow the whistle on my colleagues. We communists are systematically branded perpetrators or murderers. No one seems to care if that is true or not. In the case of those two women it's not true. I know that, and you know that. Good evening, Mr. Rath. I'm sorry. I was held up. You look adorable. Willi? This is Bruno. You can deliver the shipment. To my basement. Yes, alright. You know where the key is. - Excuse me. - Yes? Is there a shortcut to the police estate somewhere? Yes, through there, keep to the left, and cross the premises. It's on the other side of the factory. Thank you. A great tip. Hello? Hello! Freeze, police. Who are you? What do you want? To ashes, to dust Stolen from the light But not yet now Miracles wait until the end Ocean of time Eternal law To ashes, to dust To ashes But not yet now
