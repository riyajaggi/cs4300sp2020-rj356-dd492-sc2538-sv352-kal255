 Previously on Babylon Berlin. The foreman found a human foot in the foundation yesterday morning. They found a body whose clothes make an unambiguous attribution possible. The man must have been a priest. - Has he been identified? - Saint Josef. A little souvenir of your exciting time in the capital. I was asked to hand this in for Chief Inspector Böhm. - Never flown before? - No. - No. - It's the first flight for these men. Go on, then. These documents are proof of a German base in the Soviet Union,

 where German pilots are trained to become fighter pilots by German experts. We have reliable information that certain circles are planning to assassinate you. - Communists? - National forces. Mr. Benda is not a murderer. Is he nice to you, yeah? No, but he has a good heart. I know that. Gretchen, that may be so. But he's also the chief of the political police. - You didn't tell me you have a son. - Moritz isn't my son. - I see. - No, he's my nephew. Make yourselves at home. Charlotte. He's asking if you need a bed. - Well, if that's possible... - No problem. Stop! Stop!

 Stop! She says, she really wants to become a detective. Are women even allowed to do that? Why not? It's making me nervous when you look over my shoulder. I like her. Who? The girl. She would be right for our boy. She'd wake him up. Well, let's go, there's no one in. Always the hammering. They are deaf, for goodness sake. You have to press that. - Here, the light switch? - Yes. Their son fixed that for his parents. Mr. Jänicke? Hello. May I come in? Hello. - There he is. - It's him. Is all this because of us? What happened? Gentlemen, thank you. Chief Inspector Böhm has visited the crime scene. Inspector Böhm, your report, please. To put it briefly, it was an accurate shot to the head. Like an execution. The Russians? No, the unusual make of the weapon points in another direction. Very rare. Made by Lignose. Lignose? Hang on a minute. We just had one like that. - The priest. - Saint Josef. I had Mr. Ullrich of Ballistics examine the projectiles immediately. - And? - It was the same weapon. Is that certain? Same weapon or same make? The same weapon. Stefan Jänicke and Josef Wilczek were shot with this weapon. There's no doubt. Those are the two projectiles. Lignose 6.35. We've compared the fine lines scratched into the bullets by the barrel of this precise weapon. As you can see, the images are identical. We use the following method to check our hypothesis. We dip the projectiles in ink and roll them with gentle pressure on absorbent paper. - This is Jänicke, this is Wilczek? - Exactly. It's the same image. Gentlemen. There is something else which is odd. Both victims died when they were on their way to see you... or had already seen you, Mr. Rath. - I beg your pardon? - Jänicke was found by your nephew. Around the corner from your new residence. - Why wasn't I told about this? - You could not be reached. As we all know, you're on a secret mission. But you remember your encounter with Father Wilczek? What are you talking about? You were the last person to see the murdered priest alive. - When was this supposed to have been? - Last Thursday. - I have never seen that man. - That's not true. You were spotted, together with Wolter and the holy smoke. Stop that nonsense. - Is this an interrogation? - Enough. - I'm just asking question. - Chief Inspector. Please continue in a constructive way. Why does the guy from Cologne run straight to the body as soon as it's in Forensics - and grabs the evidence? - Now hang on a minute! Jänicke's body hasn't been autopsied yet. The other day, I'm talking about the priest's body. Is that true, Mr. Rath? I just wanted to help out, that is all. If we don't keep order, not even as far as our responsibilities are concerned, we're nothing but a pathetic bunch of slobs! Not a homicide squad. This way, we won't even find the murderers of our colleagues. And, Chief Inspector, fate doesn't usually tend to put the perpetrator straight in front of us. Least of all at police headquarters. - Has the family been told? - I went there today. By tomorrow morning... a detailed report. Crime scene analysis, witness checks. Reconstruct each and every step Stefan Jänicke took until his murder. This case is our highest priority. Gentlemen, let's go back to work. Thank you, Chief Inspector Böhm. Alright. Stefan Jänicke was a mole. Who was he working for? For me. What or whom was he investigating? There is an event, an operation called Prangertag. - What's behind the name? - An assassination plan. We don't know the details yet. The French foreign minister has been in town since Thursday. It is my responsibility to guarantee for his safety. - Stefan Jänicke had a notebook. - What about it? He was urgently trying to contact me before he died. We have to find his notes. - The book was not on him? - No. When do we get the pictures from Lipetsk? Gräf is already in the lab. It's my fault. Please. Stefan was here because of me. With us, the squad. No, that's not true. It's the other way around, in fact. You are here because of him. Can I help you? I'm looking for his notebook. - The red one? - Yes. He always carried that with him. It wasn't on his body. Who killed Stefan? The Russians? But who did it then? Jänicke was exposed, as an informer. - What? - An internal one. Who was his target? I don't know. But you suspect someone? Who was he working for? That... That's not true, I don't believe that. Why... - Why would Wolter... - I don't know. We need his notebook. Very well. NO TRESPASSING - Evening. - Evening. NO TRESPASSING We searched the lot. There was no notebook. Nowhere. - Gereon! - Quiet. Get Moritz and pack your things. - What? - We need to leave. Pack up, right away. But why? Go on now. Go on! Quiet! Gereon. The police officer I found... did he live around there? No, he didn't. Did he want to see the Chief Inspector? No. He wanted to see me. Are you sure? Yes. Keep the change. Night, Moritz. That way. Sorry, doll. Couldn't make it any sooner. - When are the masters back? - In about two hours. Take your shoes off. - Bullshit. - Not so loud, the kids are sleeping. Come on in. This way. Come. This way. Fritz, where are you going? - Where are they sleeping? - Upstairs. I'll... - What's in there? - The dining room. Fritz, please, we mustn't go through there. Are you nuts? That's the old man's study. - Come. - No. That's enough. - Come. - No. Enough. Come. Come here. Since when have you been smoking? Since just now. From what did we flee? I can't tell you. You're safe here. From whom? Does this have anything to do with your secret mission? You were gone. I don't know where. I was in Russia. In Russia? How did you get there so quickly? In a plane. You flew on an airplane? Yes. What's it like, flying? Wobbly. Come to me. Hear this? Everything sounds different from home. I emptied my savings book... took Moritz out of school. I left two large suitcases at Margarete's. Your father has no idea. If you want, we can make a fresh start, here in Berlin. Do you want to? Rudi? Charlotte. That's nice. I'm sorry. I just wanted some sleep, but it seems I'm interrupting. Not at all. This is Erika. - And this is... - This is Pille. Come. Some other time, yeah? PEA SOUP 30 I used to think my mother didn't like me because I am not like her or Ilse or like Toni. It started with my hair. She didn't want to comb it. "There's nothing to comb. Fluff hair," she said. Too think, too dark, you saw my sisters, they're all fairer. Not that it matters. It was Ilse who brought me up, anyway. The way I look out for Toni now. Here's to your mother. May she rest in peace. She won't rest. I used to think I was switched at birth. - But? - It was a home birth. That would be difficult. Bruno? Did you kill him? Who? Stefan. Stefan? Jänicke? Who says? - Did you? - No, of course not. - No? - No! Swear. Why should I... Why should I kill Jänicke? Swear, Bruno. Yes, I swear, I didn't kill him. I swear to you. On my wife's life. Every woman has a desire And a secret wish in her heart Every woman dreams of sin sometimes Of the greatest night Yet to come Every woman has some kind of desire For a sweet And forbidden kiss Bruno? Bruno? - Gereon. - Emmi. How did you get in? With the key. I called out, too. - I wanted to return it. - Yes. Don't tell him, OK? Nor you. That I scared you so. You weren't even here. See you soon. Yes. Gereon, what are you doing here? Clocking off already? I know the score, Bruno. Why? I noticed you moved out. Why don't I know about it? Answer my question. Have you found something suitable? Why did you shoot Father Wilczek? With your service weapon, I take it? Why else would you have swapped the bullets? That was a mistake. And you shouldn't have used Krajewski's weapon. - The Lignose. - You're totally right. But this way we have two bodies now. And all evidence points towards a copper from Cologne... who can't deal with the temptation of the big city. In a drug frenzy, he first shoots a priest... and then his own assistant. How do you want to get away with this? Leave that to me, my friend. Give my regards to wife and child. I bid you goodbye. What an arsehole. Shorthand. All of it. Mr. Rath, what's going on? Where are we going? Come. - What... - I've got it. Where was it? Wolter had it, at home. What? I found it in his desk. That's impossible. He did it. How can you... How can you be so sure? Firstly, the forensics report. Secondly, I know where Mr. Wolter keeps the gun. And thirdly... Charlotte, I... I tried to use a bullet from that same weapon to deflect suspicion from myself. What suspicion? I can't read any of this, it's all in shorthand. You have to translate this for me, please, OK? - Here? - No. I want you to take it with you and go home. And take your time with it. Alright. We can't trust anybody anymore. Thank you. I can't stand by and watch. Thanks. - When did you get on? - At Spittelmarkt. Well, I think you need a schnapps. Come on, let's go to Clärchen's, I've got a coaster there. - Shall we? - Yes. Actually, I don't have any time. Neither do I. - What are you doing? - Go on, get in, doll. To ashes, to dust Stolen from the light But not yet now Miracles wait until the end Ocean of time Eternal law To ashes, to dust To ashes But not yet now It must be just a dream Trying to snatch the wind Who really knows? The clock on your wall It is filled with sand Put your hand in mine And let us be forever Now you make your choice And throw us in between happiness and agony But I can forgive you You are very close to death But your eye still clear Does it recognize me? I'm ready To seek immortality with you
