 Previously on Babylon Berlin. It is our duty to build a bulwark against anarchy. They shot them down like sparrows off the roof. Hang on, no one saw that. The blood is not even dry yet and you're already covering it up. SEEKING WORK Don't you recognize me anymore? Greta! Must have been under a car. Doesn't look like an accident. He wasn't a tough guy. I realized that too late.

 What else does your landlady know about this Kardakov? Allegedly, he's on tour. They were all killed because of you. They are all dead! I wanted to ask if you have looked into the previous tenant. Kardakov's lover lives at Meraner Strasse, number seven. I'm meeting him. Put me through to the Soviet embassy. Hands up, police! Leni. Leni, look. Boom. Get that thing off him. He's a big boy, he knows how it works, right? Boom.

 Hans, give your father the pistol right now. No. Come on, give it to me. - Come on, give it to me. - No. No. Svetlana! Sveta, where are you? Go on. Sveta, where are you? We need to go. What's with the masquerade? What's going on? They're coming after us. They're already on the stairs. Svetlana, I beg you, come on! They'll shoot us right away. Not us. You. You bastard! That bastard sliced open my hand! Sveta. Done. - Give it to me. - No! - Let go. - Stop! - Give it to me! - Let go! Give me that. Get lost then. THIRD CLASS NON-SMOKING Greta! Morning. Where were you last night? I didn't find you. I thought you weren't coming back. I had no idea where you had gone. Have you slept? Come on, then. - Berta, where's the Widow? - Downstairs. - May I interrupt? - You already have. I won't be long. This is Greta. - So? - Comes highly recommended. I'm interested. She should take a shower first. The showers at the Palace are out of order, hence the request. Vocal chords are in working order, yeah? Hello, Madam. Don't you Madam me. You may well be a beauty, but I can't see what's underneath. - Can we borrow from the wardrobe? - You do that anyway. Come on. - Impress me, children. - We will. You get three marks per visit. You'll be able to take a room by tomorrow. And you can borrow the clothes. You just have to return them. You have to wash them, but... you can take what you like. Greta? I can't do this. But Greta, you're beautiful. But I can't do this. But why not? I promise, it's not that bad. You can choose the guys. If you don't like them, you rebuff them. That's how it works. Is it inflamed? A little. It's OK. We'll find something for you. Yes. Come here. Everything will be alright. My sweet Gretha. Lignose. - Stefan. - Charlotte. - What are you doing here? - I work here. I'm looking for a file right now. But this is Detective Sergeant Wolter's desk. Yes, and I'm his assistant. What are you doing here? I... I'm supposed to deliver something, but only in person. Where is he? Wolter? Somewhere in the building. - Alright, I'll come back later. - Sure. Oh, is the invitation still valid? Go swimming at Sunday at 11 a.m.? - At the rowing club, I thought. - Oh. Yes, of course. At the entrance. I'll take you in. Nice. I really tried everything. More is not possible. I'd ask at the film lab, where they store the negatives. They do? See the right-hand bottom corner, near the perforation? It's cheap material. The film's positive, the snippet you found, with which it was developed. - So? - The material was imported from Yugoslavia, from Zagreb. I asked around. If I may? Of course. The only film lab where they sometimes use Rodacor is Geyer. - Where is that? - In Neukölln. It's a big shop. - Does that help you? - Yes. Thank you for your efforts. Yucatan. Hello, I'd like a Cologne number. 13-0-8. Thank you. Rath. Helga, it's me. - Gereon. - Can you talk? Yes, of course. Did something happen? I just wanted to get in touch. I had a strange dream. Of Anno. I mean, of his Trakehner horse. Yucatan. Yes. Gereon? Yes? I miss you so much. Why don't you come here? Come to Berlin. But I can't just do that. No one would give a damn about us. - How do you mean? - I mean... It would be nice to have you here. You mean, you and I and two beers at Tiergarten, at night dancing at Resi's and breakfast at Krumme Lanke? "Everyone once in Berlin." "Everyone once in Berlin." Oh, that would be nice. But it's not that simple. Yes... You're right. It was a silly idea. I have to go now. Have you seen this? BLOODY STREET FIGHTS - 200 DEAD? Murderers! Murderers! Murderers! Murderers... BLOODY STREET FIGHTS - 200 DEAD? And this is what happened to us in Oranienstrasse. The official version. Owing to the two ladies. "we were shot at from various sides. Some of the communists were shooting at myself and Detective Rath." Are you serious? "A hand is washed by the other only If you want to take, give!" The top dogs are under a lot of pressure. FIGHT WITH KPD DOWN WITH POLICE KILLERS Comrades. Workers were shot down like dogs. - Flats were ransacked! - You can add your own style. - Children abused! - I'm no man of words. By the men - behind the walls of this building here. - God, her again. I myself witnessed how they attempted to frame our fighters for a murder by the police. Of two innocent women! And the chief of police tells the public to keep cool. "Keep cool" in this situation is the most inappropriate of all slogans. For the blood of our comrades is seeping away in the cobblestones of our streets. Shed by those murderers in uniform. We need to put an immediate stop to this agitation. Workers' blood is flowing in Berlin! Our blood is not still. Our blood is at boiling point! I will have the square cleared. Karl... we need to tread carefully, not exert more pressure. Otherwise the situation will escalate right at our doorstep. Should we give them more time to stage a storming of the Bastille? We're not the Bastille. The Lord Mayor Böss! Gentlemen. They have gone... 200 DEAD ON MAY THE FIRST? Completely wild out there. Why don't you take a seat, Lord Mayor? What are you planning to do? The entire city is in turmoil! We have initiated a range of measures. By tonight we'll be in total control again. What are those measures? A curfew after dark, in all affected neighborhoods. Street-facing windows need to be closed. Civilians are banned from carrying weapons. Noncompliance can mean that our officers will open fire. - That's not very... - Not very what? Our own party organ mentions up to 200 dead. That is false information. - So? - The hospitals report fewer casualties. And this? "Execution by police bullets." Those are the two Kreuzberg women. They're martyrs already. How do you want to interpret this? Self-defense? We have a couple of witnesses from vice, they're writing a report which will shine the right light on things for us. Maybe there is a way to turn the mood around. Which is? We keep learning that it's all a question of interpretation. No one is writing "The demonstrators were armed" or "we, the police, were attacked." But we'd need proof. An injured policeman. Something unambiguous. Yes. Exactly. Murderers! Murderers! Inspector, this is the way out. Violence is the midwife of every new society. This is what Marx is teaching us. And those times are violent, comrades. For each of our dead comrades... Can I become a member? Sure, register here, comrade. We should liquidate one of the representatives of this oppressive regime! That's the only language those people understand. Murderers! Murderers... Alright, call a press conference. Very good. Yes. Flown the nest. Both of them. - When do you expect them back? - Do I have to tell you? I can take you back to the station where we'll write a report. I have no idea when they're back. It's always different. They're artists. - Do you have the key to the flat? - No, no. Not right now. - He's got it. - Kardakov? - Yes. - When was he here? Last night. - What? - Yes. He had forgotten his key. And he didn't return mine, of course. - So maybe he's in? - I thought you already rang the bell. I'll go upstairs and knock, OK? Sure, I'll wait. - Second floor? - Yes. Miss Detective? - Nothing. Thank you. Bye. - Bye. Someone up there? Hello? - To the Holländer. - Yes, Mr. Trechkov. That's her. Hello, miss. Do you have your service card? There is no Johann König here. Do you have a company name? König Film Production. König Film Production... I don't have that. Nothing at all? No? What about Krajewski, Franz? Yes, here. - Are you Mr. Krajewski? - No, I'm his deputy. Only this gentleman can collect the material. Alright. Who is the technical supervisor of this order? Film 701, Sternberg, Mrs. Dietrich 195, take three. Listen, you can't just... You should have been a genius. One more time. Mr. Meyer, I'm sorry. I tried to stop him, but he just walked in. What's going on, Meyer? - That's impossible. - I'm sorry, Mr. Director. What are you thinking? Is this piano playing? Am I to sing to that crap? That's OK for the wash tub, but not here. Who's the lady? That's... Dietrich. Dietrich. Marlene Dietrich, you cretin. What do you want? I'm with vice. I want to talk to you. Here or at the station. Meyer, can we carry on, please? I haven't stolen my time. For God's sake! Please put me through to Cologne, 13-0-8. - Hello? - It's me. They only ever made one copy of each of König's films. Are you sure? - Yes. - And the negative? They're not storing the negatives there. The courier always took them. - Can you get a hold of the courier? - Yes. You know I guaranteed that we would solve this problem before the elections. I'm aware of that, Father. Alright, keep me posted. - Krajewski? - Hasn't been here yet. TOWARDS SEESTRASSE WEDDING Train to Wedding, board now. I don't have any news. But I do. I went to the film lab. Train to Wedding, please stand back. Stand back! He's a copper! A copper, comrades. A murderer! Hey, you. Traitor of the working classes. Get lost! - We don't want any... - Police pigs! And this. And this. And many more. What do you want me to do? Nothing. Absolutely nothing at all. But one day... this could change. Kardakov is outside. - Who? - The violinist. - What does he want? - I don't know. He's messing up my car. He's not paying, either. Mr. Kardakov, what do you want from me? I have something for you. I didn't hear you. Gold. The gold of the Sorokins. - What? On my behalf? - You'll come and collect her? And where? Police District 14, Charlottenburg . POLICE HEADQUARTERS BERLIN 14TH DISTRICT Thank you. I know, those were dishonest methods. But I have neither name nor rank to lose, - I get to make mistakes. - Mistakes. Pretending to be police and breaking into a flat is not a mistake. - What is it then? - It's worse. - You lied to me. - I did not. - No? - You thought I was Böhm's assistant. I just... wanted to respond to your wish. Besides, I found something. The bullet. - The colleague at the station said... - He's not your colleague. I'm sorry. Your colleague said it is 6.35 calibre. Detective Inspector. Mr. Rath! Don't be like this. It's alright. By the way, Alexey Kardakov was still there last night. Where, in Berlin? In Sorokina's flat. He had forgotten his key, said the caretaker. - So... he really didn't leave the city. - Looks like it. - Come on. - Where to? We'll take a closer look at what's in the suitcase. Let me do this. Come on. And this? Have you heard of this? THE ILYA TRECHKOV ENSEMBLE Trechkov. Kardakov and Sorokina play with Ilya Trechkov. - I know him. - Who is he? A famous bandmaster. He plays with Uncle Jim at Holländer. But usually with a different band. On Saturdays. That's today. - That's great, we'll go. - We? Why should I take you with me? Because I know where Holländer is and you don't. And no one else you know does. - And if they knew they wouldn't tell you. - Oh yeah? Yes, you're the police. Are you eating this? Ortgies, 6.35 calibre. What does that tell you? - Would be fitting for Kardakov. - Why? It's a "weapon for the opera". Used by people who don't know how to shoot. Musicians, artists, and such like. So, tonight, 9 p.m. at Holländer. Nine? No point in going there before midnight. More like 1 or 2 a.m. - Alright, midnight then. - Friedrichstrasse station. It's nearby. I'm with Weltbühne. I'm an accredited journalist. Excuse me... Hello, neighbor. Mr. Katelbach. What's going on? Your Presidentsky is trying to save his honor. Like, if the reds shoot, so can we. I'm afraid we're missing half of it. You wouldn't happen to know a back door? Gentlemen, welcome to this press conference. We called it to shed the right light on some things. - Excuse me. - Excuse me. Excuse me. The gentleman is with me. It wasn't the police who incited the riots, but the communist associations who, without any respect of state order, called for an attack on the police forces who were there for de-escalation. Let me introduce one of our heroes to you, whose brave commitment for law and order received a hail of bullets from trigger-happy Bolsheviks in thanks. Constable Fritz Dörr. A true hero, him? Lies! Boom. Great. On behalf of the Fatherland: Thank you. Great. CARETAKER, SECRETARY CLEANING PERSONNEL MECHANICS, GUARDSMEN, DOG HANDLERS, ARCHIVERS Hello. I have an application. For deputy inspector. - Department? - Homicide. Do you have your certificate of conduct? - I'll hand it in later. - Put it in there... APPLICATIONS Housemaid wanted. State councillor Benda. - Is this the exact wording? - Yes. Very good. Any other new findings? Unforeseen risks? I'm invisible. I'm sure of it. You must never be sure of anything. Of course. You know how sensitive this affair is. At some point the decisive clue will present itself. We must not miss this moment. I know, Mr. Councillor. - You're doing a good job, Stefan. - Thank you. But strike the word "security" from your vocabulary. Yes, sir. - Excuse me. - Wow! You look good. How charming! Come. - Evening. - Evening. Bellissima! How you light up our house. Shall we go powder our nose? I'll be right back. Then I always only think of you Then I always think of you And I tell myself My rose, stay and never forget me Inspector? Mr. Gräf! - I didn't expect you here. - I didn't expect you, either. Excuse me. And good evening. - Amazing as always. - Same goes for you. Hello, darling. Long time no see. Everything fine? - Yes. And yourself? - Good. I'll have what he's having. Lemonade for the lady. What? With a shot, please. And you? Thanks. I have to go back to my family. Inspector. Is that Trechkov? On stage? Yes, that's him. We'll meet him in the break. Shall we? Oh, Kardakov. He's wasting his talent, the moron. I hate him. He's so gifted you have to hate him. I told him, you are our real star. Your crazy violin is of the devil. And he goes off to play revolution. I hate him. I hate that fortress. - The Red Fortress, right? - The whole bunch is crazy. They actually think they could topple Stalin. The whole thing is a ghastly idiocy. The leader, Trotsky, is down in Turkey, wasting the lives of other people. - I hate him. - What about the countess, - Ms. Sorokina? - Oh, her. She's made it all worse. She's turned his head. Then she ran off with him. I hate her. Where could this Kardakov be? I swore I would keep it to myself, but... discretion is not my passion. In Köpenick. At Wormsstrasse. There's some kind of basement. In there is a printer's. And? It's the headquarter of the Red Fortress. - I love that piece. - So do I. - What? - Want to dance? Are you serious? Are you married, by the way? No. But going steady? It's not that simple. "Love is not simple. It's very complicated. Or our Sigismund wouldn't have embarrassed himself." - And you? - Me? Go steady? Spare me. Why do people see that differently, but not in Berlin? We're just a bit faster than the rest. Of the fair people. Always a quick answer, even if it isn't one. A quick answer is better than slow silence right? And always the last word. No. What time is it? I'll take you home now. No. But I have to run. No back talk. This is most kind, Mr. Rath, but... I have plans. See you tomorrow. Home after all? No, but... do I get paid by someone for this? For my work? I have no idea. How do you mean? We've only just started. Alright. Bye. It must be just a dream Trying to snatch the wind Who really knows? The clock on your wall It is filled with sand Put your hand in mine And let us be forever Now you make your choice And throw us in between happiness and agony But I can forgive you You are very close to death But your eye still clear Does it recognize me? I'm ready To seek immortality with you
