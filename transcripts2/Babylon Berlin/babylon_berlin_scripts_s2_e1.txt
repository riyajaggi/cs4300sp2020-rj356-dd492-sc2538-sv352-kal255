 Previously on Babylon Berlin. - I could work at the slaughterhouse. - No way. He should find work. Why doesn't the little one go if I can't find work? Are you nuts? Toni goes to school. That's why we go to work. Calm down. I'm still here. You must make sure that this train doesn't cause any kind of publicity. My name is on the freight papers. There is phosgene in those wagons. A banned chemical warfare agent. With this quantity you could wipe out all life in a city the size of Berlin. You will have to answer for this.

 Misha, Yuri... They were all killed because of you. They are all dead! At Wormsstrasse, there is a kind of basement. It's the headquarter of the Red Fortress. This putty is fresh. They call sheets that are stuck in the press "print king". - AB 3-2-2-1. - Istanbul. Dearest Helga, my thoughts have been churning in my head, but one of them has caught on. I can't live this secrecy anymore. You say, you can't simply start from scratch in Berlin. But I can't return to Cologne, either. Back to a life which shirks the truth. Forgive me. Gereon.

 Get lost. - What's the matter with you? - Get lost! Mr. Rath? It's for you. One moment. Hello? Councillor Benda for you. I'll put you through. Rath? Mr. Councillor? We've got Kardakov. He was found yesterday. Together with 14 other bodies. The chief of the homicide squad is there. - The Buddha? - In person. That's him. Don't ask too many questions, he'll approach you. May I introduce? Criminal Counsellor Gennat, chief of Homicide... Come with me. How did you identify him? A telegram, stuck in his jacket pocket. Show us, Krüger. - Is it in code? - Yes. But look at the recipient. -Kardakov. - Russian. Who speaks Russian? - I do, sir. - Go ahead, Czerwinski. Yes, sir. So the vice squad is looking into murders now? This case is also of importance for the political police. Your presence is clear proof of that, Mr. Councillor. Come along. It seems that the 13 men and two women were liquidated with machine guns. Including shots in the neck. - All of them? - Yes. They wanted to make very sure. We found projectiles in the neck area. They look like 7.62s. A proper firing squad. Which one is Kardakov? Here, number six. See? The back of the head. One shot from close range. On top of a dozen machine gun bullets. The Red Fortress. Henning, help him. This is not Kardakov. Who could have done that? The Soviet secret service? That would be my assumption. - Gennat, what do you think? - Formidable evidence. Ballistics will tell us more in a few hours. But... apart from the Russians, only the Swedes use large-calibre weapons. For shooting elks. There are no elks in Berlin. This is sensitive, politically speaking. I don't care about politics. I'm a simple detective. I've got 15 murders here, that's no trifling matter. What you make of my findings politically is up to you. But we share the same goal. We want the perpetrators. So... Mr. Rath. The Councillor tells me you're on this case? So put a squad together. Get to work. Thank you. DEPARTMENT A HOMICIDE AND AGGRAVATED ASSAULT Fifteen bodies. Only one was missing: Alexey Kardakov. See? You know the deal. That's why I would like you to be my assistant. So, are you in? Inspector, I'm honored, but... What? I know someone who knows this case a lot better than me. - But I want you. - Yes, but... - But all I know, I know from... - If I wanted Charlotte Ritter, I would have asked her. So, can I count on you? Good. - You've been to the printer's shop. - Yes. Anything conspicuous? Well, the 'print king.' A freight paper. It was stuck in one of the presses. For one of the wagons of our gas train. It was destined for Istanbul. I see. Where is it? I don't know. Maybe... Maybe she kept it. - Kept it? - Well... It wasn't according to the books, the way we got in. That girl doesn't know how to spell the word "legal". PUBLIC BATH Half an hour, 25 pfennigs. - Six for a second towel. - One is enough, thanks. Come with me. - Head or tails? - Tails. OK, you first, and hurry up this time. Still nothing? - From the Cologne guy? - No. I'm afraid he's written me off. And the other one? - The little one. - Stefan? Oh, he's a gusher. And Rudi? He's not showing either, the putz. Did you do something wrong? Me? - No, why do you say that? - Well... What? Well, sometimes you can be a bit forward. What are you... Three guys on the go, and all of them gone? Oh, you. Just because you're freshly fried by your Willi. His name is Fritz. - Get out now, it's my turn. - This is unfair. - Why? - Quarter of an hour each. No way. It's heat, length, dirt. - What's that supposed to mean? - You had the hot water, so I get more time in your broth. Yes. Get out now. For you. Open it. - Me? - Who else? Him or what? Dirt bag. Mother is sleeping. Go on. From him. Thank you. Try it on. Sure, so you can sneak a peek? Do you want it or not? Out with it. Good money. A bang for the buck. Excuse me. Where do I find Miss Ritter? Upstairs, under the roof. Thank you. Mother? Mum? Hello. Is this the Ritter family? Depends on what you want. I'm looking for Charlotte. Now her suitors come to the house or what? Go away. She's not here. And don't come back. Or you'll be spoiling for a fight. It's an official matter. Understand? Oh, you're police. Why didn't you say so? What do you want now? - Do you know where Lotte is? - It's bath day today. Public baths, Gerichtsstrasse. Around the corner. Get it or do I need to draw a map? Oh man. What's the matter with you? It looks good. What happened to your baby? I gave it away. - But it's alive? - Yes. Where? In town somewhere, I guess. - What's its name? - Didn't have a name yet. - Boy or girl? - A boy. - Hajo. - No. Why? Hajo is nice. I call him Little Häwelmann. For myself. Hajo Häwelmann. I don't believe this. I'll do this. Not a second to dry off. I don't believe this. Where is the paper you took from the printer's? First you tell me to go to hell, now you come back and want something? I want the evidence. I tried to reach you but you had them say you weren't at the office. Had I wanted to talk to you, I would have done so. Give me the document. - I chucked it. - Are you nuts? You can't chuck evidence. You promised me I could grow into this job. That we could solve this case together. - I promised you nothing. You lied to me. - I did not. Yes, of course. You abused my trust and spied on me. The evidence is in a safe place. Where? I give you the correct wagon number, you'll give me another chance. - Why should I? - I apologize. And if you want, I'll explain the circumstances, too. You get dressed first. Please hold this. Thanks. This is odd. But it has to be here. Right. WAYBILL Transfer papers for one wagon. AB 3-2-2-1. Pass this on. Gentlemen, this is Inspector Rath from Cologne. - Hello. - Hello. Mr. Rath is investigating by personal order of Councillor Benda. Which is? The starting point is an unidentified body which was found in the Landwehrkanal. The Russian? - Why not a special commission? - That's what we have now. Inspector Rath has come across a lead which will probably go far beyond the expat environment. - Meaning? - The man was a railway worker, and he had a secret mission. He was tortured before he died. That's standard practice for them. We're assuming this is a political crime. The dead man was a member of a Russian resistance organization, Red Fortress. Apparently, they're active in Germany too. Their aim is to overthrow Stalin in the Soviet Union. Who wouldn't want that? The 15 bodies in the pine forest were all members of the Red Fortress. We're still looking for the head of the group, a man called Alexey Kardakov. What are we to do with Russian extremists? What's the homicide squad to do with them? Inspector Rath has found a freight document which implicates the group in a politically charged smuggle case. The chief of police himself has ordered the surveillance of the train on which the murdered railway worker arrived in Berlin. Is that enough for you? Right, carry on. What else is there? - The body in the cement. - That's right. Fresh intel, please. Construction site Ackerstrasse. - Yesterday, the foreman found... - When exactly? At 6.45 a.m., he found a human foot in the foundation. The cement had been cast days ago, but the block had a tear. It was prized open last night. They found a body whose clothes, as you can see, make an unambiguous attribution possible. - Meaning? - A cassock. The man must have been a priest. Has he been identified? We're still trying to get the stuff off the body. But... we found a gunshot wound. Where is the dead man? Right now on his way to the autopsy. - At Dr. Schwarz's? - Yes, sir. I don't have to go there. I know him. It's Saint Josef. Henning? That's him. That's not good. Böhm, that's your case. Alright. Gentlemen, thank you very much. Good day. Why does vice from Cologne want from me? I'm Berlin and Homicide now. That priest, where is he? From this morning? - In manufacture. Just finished. - Can I see him? I was expecting Chief Inspector Böhm. It's about the ballistics. I see. Well, he doesn't look like a clergyman exactly. How did he die? Cardiac arrest. Following deliberate foul play. There. Thank you. I'll take the bullet. For god's sake, please don't touch it. The Buddha will kill me. New rules. Absurd. But success proves Gennat right. - Here you go. - Thank you. Wegener. Heaven sends you. This is the business report. The shareholders' meeting was moved up to tonight, 6 p.m. But it was scheduled for next week. At the request of your mother. Don't worry, you have plenty of time to freshen up. - Who's this Saint Josef? - Josef Wilczek. A heavy guy. He does the dirty work for the gangland. He's with the Armenian. A local gangland bigwig here in Berlin. You already said local. Not anywhere else, but here. How would he know I mean Berlin? I know who the Armenian is. I've come across him, thanks. Inspector? For the sake of form, who does which tasks in your commission? So we can get started and... You're my assistant. Messrs. Czerwinski and Henning are special investigators and she's the clerk. - You know Miss Ritter, I take it? - Yes. Good. Tell me, were you able to decipher the telegram? Good grief, I totally forgot about that. - Holy cow. - On the double now. - Yes, yes. - Mr. Rath? - Shall I come with you? - Or I? - No, I'll go alone. - Mr. Rath. - What is it? - We didn't know... They're waiting. Who? Your relatives. Hey, Junior. Inspector. Come on in. That's quite the surprise. You wouldn't have expected that, right? - Was that your idea? - No, Mum's. Didn't you get my letter? I did. Moritz, will you leave me and your uncle alone? Your brother Anno was officially declared dead. We received the official certificate. He's no longer missing, he's finally declared killed in action. And now? We're here if you want us to be. Bruno, I need your help. Stop. This is the correct way. Madam. Thank you, Bruno. Right, off we go. See you tonight. - I want the homicide squad. - You want the homicide squad! There are no women. We couldn't get the cement out. It was too hard already. Thank you. Goodbye. DRY CLEANERS Here, a little souvenir of your exciting time in the capital. - Yes? - Hello. I was asked to hand this in for Chief Inspector Böhm. Saint Josef. I heard. Let's see who offed him. One second. Sign here. Of course. CONFIRMATION OF RECEIPT/EXIT Thank you. Tomorrow we'll know more. Hey girl, where are you headed? Excuse me, I'm looking for my sister. She works here. Charlotte Ritter. Well, let's inquire. How will we pay for that? We don't even have the three marks. They'll come and collect her. That's the easiest way. It must be possible for us to get her buried somehow. - It's not. - You say that. From the public health officer. DEATH CERTIFICATE He wants three marks. Call the Charité hospital so they come and get her. - Why? - They'll take her for free. Do you know what they'll do with her? Doesn't matter. She's dead. And dead she is. Do you want to pay Grieneisen and his crematory? Do you know how much he charges? Mother won't go to the Charité. I don't want that. - I don't want them to cut her up. - Well then. - Take care of it. - And you pay for it. I will. Your pussy will have to meow a lot until you get the 80 marks. Ordering quantities have stabilized for diggers and deep-freezers. We're in good hope for the extension of the railway network in the south-west where the planned 450 kilometers... stabilized our financial situation, and in very difficult times, too. Some of our partner companies and competitors in the German Reich have dropped out of our core businesses. The market, on the other hand, has expanded. The new possibilities are stunning. To analyze them, and to cast a creatively daring and at the same time economically conservative glance at the future of Nyssen AG is what we want to achieve at today's shareholder meeting. To present the business report of Nyssen AG, please extend a warm welcome to Mrs Annemarie Nyssen. Thank you. Today we need to align pleasant and unpleasant things. Our annual accounts are pleasant. Despite all the dire prophecies, we can be proud of our balance of '28. Unpleasant are the rumors which circulate around our enterprise these days. Naturally, they are all unfounded. To calm the situation, we have nevertheless taken appropriate steps and released my son Alfred from all his duties within the board. The board of directors thus follows Alfred's own wish. In future, he will exclusively attend to our trust. We all wish him strength and vision for this, and we thank him for his energy and competence which he has brought to the company in the past years. In our business report of last year we have hinted at the beneficial economy of the year 1927, but we also had to point out... that this rise was mainly due to the fact that at the time, numerous foreign loans benefitted sales on the domestic market. This could pose a danger for our further development. Your nipper, how old is he? Twelve. You never told me you had a son. - Moritz is not my son. - I see. No, he's my nephew. Oh, your sister's son. Is Helga your sister? No. She's my sister-in-law. Moritz is my brother's son. My brother's, who was killed in action. Helga is his widow. Got it now. I know all about widows. Well, has Emmi shown you everything? Yes. I can have the servant's chamber. I just have to put his bedding upstairs. Go on. It is really most kind of you, Mr. Wolter. Bruno. You'll be rid of us come Sunday. What's on Sunday? I have a speech at the Association for Veterans and War Widows. - Here in Berlin? - Yes, as an exception. - It's a bit narrow up there, huh? - No, it's cosy. You've found my gloves. Come with me, little Schmeling. Can I try them on? - Come here then. - Thank you. Put the gloves on first. Here. Right arm down... Everyone once in Berlin. Don't you know what that means? No more secrecy. Show me your left hook. I'm Delarge, you're Schmeling. Attack. And... Yes. Cover. Mind your cover. And... Bang! Delarge is down. Excuse me, Mr. Wolter. - Is this a G88? - You know this stuff, huh? Yes. That's the Gun 88. Have you held one yet? Served me well. Now in deserved retirement. And aim. - That's enough. Come. - Bruno, Mr. Rath is staying too. If you don't mind. Make yourselves at home. - Thanks, Bruno. - Nice to have you here. - Good night. - Night. I'll wake you at seven. Are you hunting a murderer? Not just one. More like a whole pack. But you know... Or... Exactly. Sleep well. Mr. Nyssen? - Mr. Nyssen. - I don't need anything, thanks. The countess is here. Who? - Miss Sorokina. - Don't even let her in! She's already here, in the salon. Here, now? She's been waiting for three hours. I couldn't stop h... What else do you want? My father had this wagon built. Shortly before the revolution. And then he hid it from the Bolsheviks. For 12 years. For years I have been trying to free my family's treasure from Stalin's claws. Your train was my last chance. So? Since the tank wagon arrived in Berlin, no one has opened it. Have you seen the freight? The gold? Have you seen the gold? Yes. We're still closed. Right, Gloria. You're number 12 on my list and I want to clock off early. Wilczek. Saint Josef? I know him. And? When does he do his round at your place? I meant on which day. Only on Sundays. He's a priest, after all. - And he was here last Sunday, too? - Yes. And who else was here? Of us, I mean. Well, Bruno. And one I hadn't met yet. He was good-looking but didn't say much. When did they leave? Wolter stayed until we closed. And the other one? Him... I didn't see him again after Saint Josef was here. Oops. Now I said something. To ashes, to dust Stolen from the light But not yet now Miracles wait until the end To ashes, to dust Stolen from the light But not yet now Miracles wait But not yet now Miracles wait until the end It must be just a dream Trying to snatch the wind Who really knows? The clock on your wall It is filled with sand Put your hand in mine And let us be forever Now you make your choice And throw us in between happiness and agony But I can forgive you You are very close to death But your eye still clear Does it recognize me? I'm ready To seek immortality with you
