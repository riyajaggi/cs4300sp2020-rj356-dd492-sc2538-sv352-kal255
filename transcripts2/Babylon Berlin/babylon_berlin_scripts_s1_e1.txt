 You long for the war so much, you're dying to finally go away and leave everything behind you. There is the woman you love. But something keeps you apart from her. NOVORZHEV, SOVIET UNION 1496 KM TO BERLIN To the right. Come on! Come on, move! What do they want? - Clothes. - Don't hurt us. Don't worry. Your clothes. Uniform. Then no harm. - We do nothing. Just clothes. - On your knees! - NEUKÖLLN, BERLIN APRIL 29, 1929. -53 A.M. You got the runs or something? It's packed in there. Go on, open it. Maria, you come out of the stable and look at the lights of Bethlehem with chaste eyes. Where the bird is. And now Archangel Gabriel, please. Maria, turn around now, I can't see anything. More this way. Frieda, you're receiving the Redeemer, I can't see that. Give it some more. Paul, faster. Turn around some more, I can't see anything. Vice squad. This is a raid! Show is over. Ladies and gentlemen, form an orderly row, pack away your genitals and keep your mouths shut. We have to take all this. Every photo, film, can, everything. You're in charge. We mustn't lose any detail. You with the trumpet, stand here. On the double. You two, pack everything into the car. - And who are you? - The carpenter. - Who's that supposed to be? - Jesus' father, of course. Look, God's also in it. And the Virgin Mary, the boy with the curly hair, everyone's here. Mr. König. Paragraph 118. Art is free. You will have to prove I'm not an artist. A rat is what you are. And you're a bluebottle. Can't ever get rid of you, huh? Too much shit stuck on you. No offense, but we can't let him get away with that. We're not done here. Won't be long, they're almost done with the holy couple. Look, sweetie. Closing time. I know you. Get them all out of there. Come on out. You'll shoot me up here and let my colleague downstairs get you? - The fat guy won't get me. - Sure he will. He's got a gun. - A bigger one than that toy of yours. - Toy? Thanks. Maybe you do things differently in Cologne, but here in the capital it's a good idea to draw your weapon first. Yes, I'm afraid it fell down the shaft back there. I'll let Willi know, you'll have it back tomorrow. Right, you nitwit. Say thank you. - What? - I can't hear you. Thank you. And do you know what for? I just saved your arse from being tried as a cop killer. You've still got the attempted cop murder going for you, apart from the filth with those little boys. - But I didn't do... - You speak when I ask you a question. But... Maybe this bullet was never fired. And somehow you got away up here. You know what I mean, right? Right. And now introduce yourself to my colleague from Cologne. Name? - Krajewski. - Beg your pardon? - Krajewski, Franz. - Rank and regiment? Private, infantry, second Hanseatic, w... - Pardon? - West front. Residence? In the ruins on Hermannplatz. I see. I get it. Now listen. Erwin in the kiosk... at the underground station. He's our guy. You'll report to him at 12 sharp. And when we ask you a question then, you'll have the answer. Come on, you trembler. Pull yourself together. Where's Lotte? Lotte? Where have you been? Everywhere. Haven't you slept at all? - No. - And right off to work? I don't know how you do it. But you know the deal. If you sleep you miss being awake. And I have to be on watch. What about here? Paradise. Leopold? Your eyes are magnets And they beam like the stars Your kisses Connecting wires Between Earth and Heaven A little technique A little love A little bliss and a little pain They are the engine of the machine And busy is the stupid heart - Left pocket. - Did you bring something? Yellow. I haven't got that one yet. What's this? Nothing. Just a bruise. Can you bring me my stockings? The fine ones, please. It's no big deal, Toni. What's with that bloody noise? And where is the rent? - On the table. - No. Half is missing. I'll have it tonight. Hey, watch it! Who can piss with a hard-on? - Why don't you touch it? - You pig. Lotte! Lotte! We need 20. Schröder will kick us out. Tonight, I promise. Lotte? Here, a little souvenir of your exciting time in the capital. - Where do you know that guy from? - Krajewski? Believe it or not, he used to be one of us. A police officer. He honestly thought he could just go back to working after the war. A trembler. One day, he's at an operation. There's a huge shoot-out... and that chicken can't get a grip on himself. They kicked him out. No honors for him. Get out of my way, you ninny! Don't. Stop it. I'm going to the police, no lie. Wanna come? At the front, those chickens folded in droves. Now you just have to breathe on them and the waterworks open. I was in Belgium. And France. What about you? Only the final game. The Siegfried Line. They're broken automatons... no more. And broken automatons belong on the landfill. Apparently. POLICE HEADQUARTERS "RED CASTLE", ALEXANDERPLATZ, MITTE, BERLIN - Morning. - Excuse me. - Excuse me, we're waiting too. - I've been waiting for an hour, too. - Chewing gum? - I'll take it. Thanks. - Has old Reckwitz been here? - Good morning, Councillor. Once. Not much going today. -Hello. - Hi. - Morning, Jänicke. - Good morning, Mr. Gräf. What a load. - Morning, girls. - Good morning, Inspector. - Who's the dressy guy? - There she is. - Morning, ladies. - Good morning. So, we need 12 transcripts... I'll do it! 37 notices of annulment for B. Thank you. - 90 citations for H. - Here. - And then we need someone who knows... - Me. French? - Miss Amelie, of course. - Thanks. Right, ladies, that's it for now. You're very welcome to wait but I doubt there'll be much more today. See you tomorrow. Yes, there is something else. Cataloguing the photography archive of the homicide squad. Here! - I'd like the lady with the green hat. - You. Thank you. Miss Ritter? Right? - The Buddha wants... - Who? Gennat, the chief of the homicide squad. Gennat wants to create a catchword register with descriptions of all murder cases of the last 13 years. Like this: Crime scene, murder weapon, condition of the body. Everything, really. - And you want me to... - You describe what you see, and in a systematic way. Take this, for example. Axe murder, split skull, amputation. The pictures are organized by case. On the back are the date and case number. Catchword register. Correct. Later on, we can look for parallels. Like if someone uses the same weapon several times or a perpetrator... You took all the pictures? Upstairs there are three times as many. One mark an hour, I'll sign off tomorrow morning. Thanks. Do you know all the stuff Inspector Rath has collected about you... in the last few weeks since you left Cologne? Let's talk about him. Let's hear it. What kind of guy is he? You want me to tell you stuff about your colleague? He knows you, so you know him. What's in it for me? For you? A kiss. Wait... you've got something there. Come on, spill. His father is the right hand of Cologne's Lord Mayor. High brass police. I know that, mate. He's ambitious. Dogged. A ferret. I know. Goes to church, prays, believes in God. Yes, I know all that. But what don't I know? How would I know what you don't know, Chief Inspector? Why is he with the vice squad? - What? - Why not something decent? Murder, corruption... secret police? - Inspector? The interrogation records. - Thank you. - Can I do anything... - Thanks. Right, where's Wolter? - He's interrogating König. - What? What... What do you want? I want to know what's between you two. And what he wants from you. Don't tell me he's just here because of your filth. He's a Catholic. They don't like this kind of stuff. Oh man! You're almost begging to go to prison as a child shagger tonight. You have no idea who you're dealing with. Who are you talking about? Gereon Rath? We were just talking about you. Good thing you're here. I just wanted to take a quick pee. I'll deal with this. You know what I'm looking for. Where is the film? Just tell him to pay. He won't pay. That's why I'm here. He will pay. Get the paramedic. Yes, sir. And come to me when he can be interrogated again. INSTITUTE FOR SUGGESTIVE THERAPY ADLERSHOF, BERLIN Franz, how are you? - Do you want to give us another try? - Yes, please. Are you off the drugs? - No, doctor, but I... - Those are the rules, Franz. We got caught this morning. And? They've got König. He didn't destroy the film. Why not? I explicitly told him to. He tried to make some money with the film. On his own account. That's not good, Franz. BORDER STATION TAUROGGEN 1046 KM TO BERLIN FRONTIER OF THE GERMAN REICH Stop. What's your freight in there? All pesticides. - Documents. - What? We must check the freight documents. Yes. - He wants to see the freight papers. - We'll just drive on. Are you nuts? Calm down. I'll handle this. - Alright? - Do it. The Reichswehr . What's going on? Why did you stop the train? We're doing our checks, Major. - Let the train through. - Major, according to our regulations... The train is running by order of the Reichswehr . It says that here, but someone has to sign off the freight documents. I need the full name. That is Major General Seegers. IMPORT LICENSE GRANTED Have a safe trip. Let's go. Uncle just passed the border. Gift on its way to Berlin. Sveta. It all went well. You are my hero. Alexey. That's untypical. Sandor is never late. Times change. - What's that supposed to mean? - Your brother's reliability has waned. More precise, please. You deliver 35,000 bottles of arrack per year. I supply the entire city, you remain silent, I pay you well, we could all be happy. - But? - There have been complaints about the quality of the alcohol. More and more often. Then I had them investigate and made an interesting discovery. What is this? I don't drink arrack with my octopus. Right? Your good, thoroughly honest and very punctual Sandor simply swapped your fine brew for cheap booze. Did he think I wouldn't notice? Did he think the fine tongues of our guests would fail? Even though the tongue is the most sensitive and has the best blood supply of all human sensory organs. Where is Sandor? What's with the whimpering? Mr. Kardakov, please. One, two, one, two, three. Thank you. The tongue... is unique. A small miracle of nature. Which is why it is also a delicacy. Where is my brother? Dr. Schmidt is outside. Enjoy your octopus, Mr. Gosztony. Doctor. I don't want to waste your valuable time. Oh, please. How can I help? I have been told that our mutual friend is doing business for his own account. König? König. He put one film aside. The man is endangering our entire operation. I'll deal with it. Good. THIRD ACT Hey, busy bee. A beer after work? I've still got work to do. Suit yourself. See you tomorrow. Listen, Bruno. Why did you start without me? Sometimes that's better. Tomorrow we'll swap. Fine with me. Here's the file. For your interrogation. Clocking off time. - I'm sorry. - I beg your pardon. I think those are yours. Yes, thanks. This must be yours. - This should be yours. - Yes, many thanks. I hope you're with vice. And I hope you're with the homicide squad. Goodbye. EVERYONE ONCE IN BERLIN THE WORLD CITY OF ORDER AND BEAUTY Everyone once in Berlin. - Good evening. - Good evening, Mr. Rath. I have mail for you. It looks like I need to stay longer. Thank you. - You were due to leave tomorrow, correct? - Correct. I'm afraid we have a union group from Leverkusen coming. First of May. - The workers' fight day. You know. - I'd take the broom cupboard. I'm really sorry. We're fully booked until the weekend. All rooms. Thank you. My dearest Gereon, Today it's been exactly four weeks since you left Cologne. Slowly it's beginning to feel like those days when you two and your brother went to war and the days were creepingly becoming longer. You said in yesterday's letter that you're about to solve the case. That keeps me up at night. Promise you'll be careful. Berlin's streets are rougher than anywhere else in the Reich. Even though I know you'll be back soon, I can't conceal the fact that my heart is afraid when I switch off the light at night and try to wrestle a little bit more mercy out of God so that nothing may happen to you in this big, strange city. With greetings and kisses. Yours, Helga. P.S. Moritz also sends his regards to the capital of the Reich. Good evening. Want a shot with that? Thank you. WORKERS! STEP FORTH AND FIGHT FOR A FOURTH INTERNATIONAL AND THE WORLD REVOLUTION - Hi, Sergey. Everyone here? - Everyone's here. Comrades. A few hours ago I received a message from our comrades at home. The train crossed the border this morning. It's coming straight to Berlin! Long live the Fourth International! Down with Stalin! Long live our comrade Trotsky! Long live the Red Fortress! - Reinvent the world in a better way. - No less!
