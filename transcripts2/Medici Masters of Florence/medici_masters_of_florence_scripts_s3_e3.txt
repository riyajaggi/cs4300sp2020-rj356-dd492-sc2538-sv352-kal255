 We've made good time... This is a good ship. Even so, we've got a great deal to do. And we don't know how much time we have. If the weather changes back in Florence... ...Riario will press his attack. So we need to work fast. You wished to see me, sir? Your next port, is it Constantinople? - Yes. - And when do you sail? With the tide in three days' time, if God is willing.

 And if I were to ask you to stay a little while longer? In case we have need of you and your fast ship? Signore. Every day in port is a day without profit... Here is your profit. Three months' worth. Same again when we sail. Then... we will wait at your command. God be praised. God be praised indeed. Signore de' Medici! Welcome! Welcome to Naples! I'm your agent, Alessi. Nice to finally meet you. Come. You must refresh yourself after the journey. King Ferrante must be very trusting... ...that the city is so unguarded...

 Well, Naples is a city of trust... So good to see you! Say nothing. Not here. Come! I will take you to your villa. Signore de' Medici! Alfonso! The Florentines... are cold... ...and hungry... demoralized. This is the time. - Let me give the command. - Not today. Lorenzo de' Medici has left the city. Left the city? You mean abandoned it. This is perfect. They'll all know it. He has gone to speak with my father in Naples. And I tell you now: there will be no attack until I hear what he has to say on this matter. Not today, then. Wait for my orders. Come and catch me! I'm here! Here. It's getting worse. I never should have taken her to mass. That church... - ...is as cold as a tomb. - No, it's not your fault. - Babies catch chills. - Yes, and die from them. - Don't say that. - Maria? Throw another log on the fire. Yes, Madonna. Lorenzo should be here. He will be. God preserve her. Amen... A delivery for Messer Medici! Suits you, Bruno. I feel like somebody's pet monkey. This is worth a fortune. Even Ferrante should be impressed by that. You must not be seen to keep him waiting. We must also not be seen to be arriving like refugees... begging for our city's deliverance. He must see confidence and strength. Into the lion's den. Messer Lorenzo... Your Highness... I confess, I'm surprised to see you here. Do you not have more pressing matters... ...to deal with back home in Florence? Like war, against the forces commanded by my son. Florence has an army... walls... ...weapons. She can perfectly take care of herself without me. I'm sure you do yourself too little credit. Forgive me. This is Enrico D'Aragona. My youngest son. Madonna Ippolita, my son Alfonso's wife. Ah, but I'm forgetting myself. The two of you know each other already, do you not? That was some time ago. Madonna. Signore de' Medici. So... ...what brings Messer Lorenzo... all the way here... to Naples? I've come to offer you a gift. Something precious from the finest milliners in Florence. That is gracious of you. But as you can see, I'm a simple man of work... ...and... luxury... ...is too often the enemy of efficiency. Besides, I have no need of cloaks of Imperial Purple. Then you can have it made into a tablecloth. These are... ...trinkets by way of a greeting. The gift I'm offering you is Florence herself. With the Pope on one hand and the French on the other... ...Naples must be very tired... of looking over its shoulder. You marry our financial power with your trade routes and together... ...well, together we could dominate the peninsula. Or... I could take Florence... ...and her coffers... and her credit... tomorrow. Well, perhaps you could. And the people will not be so easily subjugated. Your army might have to stay for years. And then instead of making you wealthy... ...Florence would just become a drain on your resources. Please... ...enjoy the liberty of our city... ...while I consider... what you have said. How much longer must Florence endure this siege? As long as we must. The great Medici family... You've heard the latest edict from the Council of Ten? Yes, it's for all of our sakes... ...sharing with the poor. Oh, really? Half our stores, half our produce just to be handed over! Really? So you would have the people starve? There's no way we can win this. Alfonso's a reasonable man. We can make a deal. Surrender, you mean? We're expecting these men... ...to give up their livelihoods... ...everything they've worked for... while Lorenzo the Magnificent... ...is off lining his own pockets God knows where! That's a lie! He's going to save the city! - Giulio... - No, Giulio's right. Lorenzo's out there risking his life... ...and all that he asks from us is that we keep faith. - Faith doesn't buy bread. - No... ...it buys us time and that's exactly what we need. My husband would never abandon us, ever. Who's the boy, Enrico? Ferrante's son, but... from the... ...other side of the sheets. I thought he'd send his bastard off to war. - Not let him sit at court. - Enrico is his favorite. He would sit him on the throne if he could. And what does Alfonso have to say about that? Alfonso is a born warrior. No interest in art, in politics, in nuance of any kind. He just does as he's told. Mind you, so does everyone around here. Even Ippolita? How did you two meet? She was on her way to Naples to be married. She stopped in Florence for a while. It was a long time ago. We need some lever, an angle. We have nothing. Perhaps you should pay her a visit. No, again. This is wrong. Please, bring me the one I asked for. Thank you. You're still working? There's still work to be done. I'm hearing it said that if the merchants must give... ...half of their bread to feed their people... ...then the bank should give half of its money. There. Half the bank's money. Are we really that poor? Ask me again tomorrow. Perhaps I'll know better then. Giulio was brave today. Perhaps it would have been better... ...had he not called Ardinghelli a liar to his face. There's a lot of anger in that boy. Lash it out like fire. - I'll speak to him. - No, don't. He was right after all. It was brave. Goodness knows we need brave men right now. What is it? The devil walks among us. Your Highness... It was my understanding... ...that you were attending to business elsewhere. Now our armies are poised to take... ...Florence, and meanwhile you've been... ...what? Conferring with Lorenzo de' Medici. What did he speak of? Compromise? Negotiations? Trade? It's all lies. Perhaps. Forgive me, Messer Riario... But he spoke also... ...of risk. And there, his words... had some merit. My army is greater than yours. My risk, therefore, is greater... ...as I have more to lose. And it seems to me, sat here now... ...that if the risk is greater, then so... ...commensurately... ...should be the gain. I don't understand. Well... ...without my army... ...and my son in the field to support... ...your attempt on Florence, you will fail. Therefore... ...if we succeed... I should be due a larger share of the city. How large? Two thirds of the territories of Florence to become... ...the subjects of the Kingdom of Naples. The city itself you could rule... ...in a practical sense, and in consultation with my son, Alfonso. The Pope will not stand for this. The Pope... or you? I'd like to speak to Madonna Ippolita... ...Lorenzo de' Medici sends his regards. Please, look at me, master... So, I can see what you are saying. Your own rooms... in the palace of Naples. Yes, indeed. I have my garden, as you see. I have my library. I have Domenico... who has been with me since I was a child. I'm well provided for. As you should be. King Ferrante asked you to join him this evening... ...in the chapel, to celebrate Enrico's... ...election to the Knights of Naples. So he knew that we'd be having this conversation. Of course. I'd be honored. I was in awe of you, you know? Such confidence. Such poise. Well, I'm very flattered to hear so. You made quite an impression for a boy scarcely seventeen. And now look at us... Both growing up... ...both married, our cities at each other's throats. And yet... it feels as though if I could find the right doorway. I could step through it and be back in Florence. In that stable of Sandro's, with you explaining his paintings to me. Ippolita, listen, I... Do you remember the painting... ...you showed me when we first met? The one Sandro was working on? Argus and Io. - No, I think you're mistaken. - You must remember. You explained it to me so clearly. How Io, the nymph, was put under the guard of the giant Argus. Argus with a hundred eyes. Eyes which were always watching her. Yes, I think I remember. If I could find the door... ...back to that time... ...and step through it... ...I would. In nomine Patris... et Filii... ...et Spiritus Sancti... Amen. Amen. Enrico D'Aragona... ...you have been deemed fit for this high estate. Do you now swear to honor and defend the Kingdom of Naples? I swear. Do you swear that you will meet all enemies of the Kingdom... ...It was a mistake coming here. If you'd stayed in Florence you could... ...have at least died with your family. Now you'll die alone. And you'll never know what happens to them. We'll see. Go forth now, and God preserve you. Enrico D'aragona... ...Knight Elect to the Kingdom of Naples. May he bring us strength and fortune! Strength and fortune! Of course... not all battles are fought with sword and shield. Is that not so, Messer Lorenzo? For example, Messer Riario here stands poised... ...to take Florence... in our name. Messer Lorenzo... ...on the other hand, offers the open... ...hand of trade in exchange for peace. Now who... should I trust, hm? Your Highness. Florence is a city of beauty and art... ...peace... ...commerce. I offer you an alliance, but I also offer you the chance... ...to build a legacy as a man of vision... ...and enlightenment. Now the real question here... ...is which side of history you wish to stand on. Who does not wish to stand on the right side of history? Huh? And an alliance... ...with the richest family in all of Italy? The Medici! It's priceless. Is it not? And yet... ...it seems that... ...the Medici... ...may not be as rich... ...as most people think. You trust an account of our worth made by our enemy? Your Highness... This is a forgery. Well, it is God's own truth. Accurate to the coin. Well, if... the Medici bank is as... rich as you say... ...they would have no problem in paying the trifling sum... ...of fifty thousand florins for your safe return. Let us see some gold, instead of just words. Of course, if one is not lying... ...perhaps the other one is. A week from now and the matter will be decided... ...one way or the other. Until then, gentlemen... you must both... ...remain... our guests. Fifty thousand florins... Does the bank have it? No. Now how did they know? Somebody has betrayed us. We'll deal with that when we get home. No, if we get home, I'll deal with that myself, you can be sure. Riario is the key. If we can discredit him... ...somehow have Ferrante turn his back on him... ...then we still have a chance. Sassetti, can you bring me those papers I asked for, please? As soon as you can. - What do the council say? - That they do not have the money. That the Medicis should look after their own... ...that 50 thousand florins can buy us more than one man's life. This is their loyalty? And in any case... What? Is that everything? What? Tell me. They say... ...that Lorenzo's life is forfeit in any case... ...once Ferrante discovers his... dalliance... ...with his daughter-in-law. It's a lie. It's a rumor spread to discredit him. That's all. Thank you, Tommaso. Would you allow us a moment, please? Well, I-I'm sorry, but there must be something we can do. It's too much. And we don't have anything close to it. That's not quite true. But fifty thousand florins! We can pay it. What? We can pay. I have it. Just. I thought you said we were poor. I said to ask me again. With the mortgages on the properties... ...and the liens on the lands we hold... ...and the villas here and elsewhere... ...if we combine all our borrowings... ...we have it. And then if we pay the ransom... Then we're penniless, yes. Penniless... and in debt... ...We'll have lost everything. Madonna? She won't stop coughing. The baby has a fever. Draft the letter of credit with my name and seal. Fifty thousand florins. Go. The situation is changing. Within a day or two we may need passage out of here... ...and at a short notice. I won't be here in a day or two. We had an agreement. There, your gold. God sees I'm an honest man. And honest men should be rewarded. Now... ...tell me why you have to set sail. An Ottoman raid. Not just one. But a sustained offensive. They are massing hundreds of ships. The first raid will be only the beginning. Where? He doesn't know where. The coastline of Naples is a broad target. As to when... ...soon enough, he wouldn't wait for us a day longer. Fifty thousand florins. Spies will be watching. Be careful, Carlo. Don't worry. You can count on me. I was hoping to speak to your mistress. These gentlemen were kind enough to accompany me. Please... come inside. Can say, I'm a little surprised to be here. In my experience... ...hostages to ransom can rarely come and go as they please. Naples is not like other cities. Here there is freedom for all. Now I'm beginning to understand that. In fact... ...it seems as though one might not be able... ...to tell if one was a hostage or not. You are indeed starting to understand. Ippolita, I need to speak with you alone. The artists you commission in Florence... ...they paint only what you ask for? Yes, of course they do. An artist should be allowed to have the freedom to do as he desires. An artist or any man? And how do you suggest that I express such freedom? That depends. And... what do you desire? Leave us. So now we're alone. You acted your part very well. So did you. So this is why I can come and go as a I please? It's... so you can... befriend me? Ferrante thinks that you have... ...that... you had... feelings for me. I'm supposed to take you into my bed and find out your plans. He'd use his son's wife that far? He would use anyone. There's to be... an Ottoman raid on Naples. Uh, I'm not sure exactly when, but soon enough. - Ferrante should be warned. - Then you should do it. No, I'm the only person he won't believe. Because to defend Naples against the Sultan... ...he would have to withdraw his army from Florence. But if he's not warned... ...all our lives hang in the balance. I thought you could tell him. Overhear it... as it were, and report it. It's too big. Your plans for negotiation, your tactics... how you wish to persuade him... that's what I'm expected to overhear. But this... pulling back the army from Florence... He would believe you'd seen through me, and played me for a fool. What if it didn't come from either of us? What if it comes from Riario? Riario can't hold the siege without the... ...Neapolitan army at his back. He'd just... Ah, he'd just bury it, he wouldn't report it. And when Ferrante discovers that Riario deliberately... ...withheld from him this information...? You are beautiful. Did you have feelings for me? I think you know the answer to that. And now? If there were a door to another time... Go. So how is your old friend? He's... ...scared. He wishes to convince you of his good faith. And does he have the money to do so? I don't know. But he seems very sure of himself. You must think me a monster. Making a cuckold out of my own son. But we all must... ...sometimes endure a little unpleasantness... ...for the greater good. And in truth... ...this wasn't that unpleasant now, was it? Well, how will Ippolita pass on... the information to Riario? Through an intermediary. A trader from the East who will tell... ...Riario's men about the Ottoman attack. For this to work, we need details. When and why the attack will come. How will we get those? We don't. Riario does. See, that's the beauty of it. He has connections to all the Pope's spies. He'll want confirmation of the rumor... ...and he'll make sure that he gets it. I don't care how much it costs. You're to find out when and where the attack will occur. - At once. - Yes. There is one thing: Are we able to read Riario's thoughts like a book now? Because I very much doubt he will simply tell us what he discovers. Ippolita will take care of it. What if it's a ploy? What if they take the ransom and the city? You really shouldn't worry. If that happens, we'll be dead anyway. What if Lorenzo doesn't wish to come home? This is reliable? It came from a merchant in Constantinople. It's written in code. What does it say? Light a candle... to Saint Lucia of the martyrs. Dear God, there's not time at all. We must tell Ferrante now. We must. By tomorrow evening, Lorenzo's week will be out. There'll be no... Medici ransom to save him. And what of Naples? Naples can look to herself. In two days... we'll be gone. And our knowledge of this leaves with us. Ferrante must never know of this. Not a whisper. What does it mean? Light a candle to Saint Lucia of the martyrs? It's the date. Lucia's saint's day is the thirteenth. The day after tomorrow. That's why they say there is no time at all. But where? Well, Naples is a vast kingdom. The attack could come anywhere along its coastline. - We need to know where. - Does it matter? Yes. Yes, it matters. If all Riario has is... rumor of an attack... ...but no place, well, then... ...he can claim that the information is worthless. It's no information at all. But if he knows where and when, and he still... ...keeps that information to himself... ...well, then that's... that's betrayal. Clear and simple. Why Saint Lucia of the Martyrs? It's part of the code. Where would you light a candle to the saint? At a crypt. And where's the crypt of Saint Lucia? - Well, there isn't one. - No, not-not in Naples. Otranto. There is a crypt of the martyrs in Otranto. Otranto, on the thirteenth. That's where the attack will be. Take me to King Ferrante. "Light a candle to Saint Lucia..." It's code. There's to be an Ottoman offensive against Naples... An attack... ...of which Signore Riario was fully aware... ...but he wishes to keep secret... ...for fear of losing your alliance. They will attack Otranto and they will do so the night after tomorrow. - That's the meaning of the note. - Highness... ...this is madness. He feeds you treason instead of a ransom. Your Highness, if you trust me... ...all I stand to gain is one extra day... ...whereas you stand to lose your city. There's no time here. Every moment they sail closer. Take command of all the forces at our disposal. Commandeer the ships in the bay... ...fit them for war as best you can... ...and set sail for Otranto. If this attack comes... ...you... will meet them. I will make you proud. If you were not the Pope's ambassador, I would have you cast in irons. And if you have played me false, no ransom will save you. I wanted to talk to you. They told me you were here. I have some money... ...put to side. - It is not a fortune, but... - I don't need money. Clarice, he'll come back. Yes. You should not believe what people say about him. They don't know him. But you do... I find no consolation in your words. Coming as they do from you, Madonna. - Thank you. - Thank you. Carlo! My God, what are you doing here? Attending to family business... as always. - On Clarice's instruction. - How is she? She's well. Maddalena has a fever, but... it'll pass. Fifty thousand florins. How is that possible? Mother must have moved heaven and earth. Well, you can thank her when you return home. No. I'll find another way. Ferrante made it clear. No ransom is going to save me. My family will need all the help it can get. But... Go back to Florence. Try and get them to safety. The kingdom of Naples is safe. The Turks have fled Otranto. This... ...is our great triumph! I'm sorry. With all my heart. I know he meant a great deal to you. He died in battle. That's what warriors should. You spoke the truth. Our armies shall withdraw... ...to defend our borders against this Turkish threat. Let the cities of Naples... ...and Florence... ...be at peace. Go at speed. No. Your Highness... Listen to me. This is our chance... Get off! You tell the Pope... that our alliance... is at an end. And you tell him to be grateful... ...that I don't send his nephew back to him dead on a spike! I've come to bid you farewell. Naples will seem... ...quieter... without you. Your husband returns soon. And with his army. For which we must both be grateful, I suppose. I brought you something to take home to Florence. I found it in the market and thought of you. The nymph Io... and the giant Argus. She's very beautiful. And very brave. I knew you had done it! - Giulio! - I told them you would! Do you? Come here. Come here, Piero. Fifty thousand florins! You've taken to working miracles. But now the bank has nothing... It's alright. Not a florin was spent. I tore the ransom up. Thank God. - Where's Clarice? - She's upstairs with the baby. The fever's broke. She's well. Go and see her. Lorenzo... You know how people talk. How rumors can spread before the truth... ...has even stepped through the doorway... They brought your things ahead. That was a gift, Clarice. Her name's Ippolita. She's Alfonso D'Aragona's wife. I met her once when she was a girl... ...and she remembered me enough to help me, when I most needed it. I would not have left Naples alive were it not for her. How can you be so sure? Perhaps God would have saved you. Clarice, nothing happened. No matter what has been said, nothing happened between us. But in your heart, you wish it had. Forgive me, I... There's a crowd outside... ...who it seems will not be contented unless they've heard... ...the news... all over again, from your own mouth. I mean, even the guards can't get them to disperse, so... Clarice? Please. I'm a member of this family. I know what needs to be done. Medici! Medici! Medici! It doesn't do to defy the Medici.
