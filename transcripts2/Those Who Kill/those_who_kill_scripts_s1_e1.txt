 Those Who Kill (2014): Season 1, Episode 1 - Pilot - full transcript 
 A drama about serial killers: the ultimate violent criminals who are surrounded by fear and mystique. When murders are not grounded in traditional motives and patterns of behavior, it takes a very particular kind of person to catch the serial killer; someone who knows and understands the killer's dark side and the fantasies that plague him.

 that's full of asbestos. Ah, bullshit. Give me this. I wouldn't do that. Telling you, you don't want to do... What'd I tell you guys? Don't worry about nothing, it's just dust. Look. Dust. No asbestos. _ _ Oh... Molbeck: Lieutenant Dunn. Wh-what's going on? It's Jensen, sir.

 Dunn: She called all this in for one body? She's been in Homicide for, like, six months. Molbeck: She's doing her due diligence, man. I'm sorry. Who's the lead detective on this? You are, sir. This is a waste of time. Get that mummy out of here. I just started recording the crime scene here. - Can't you wait until I... Dunn: - Now. Careful. Molbeck: You gotta sign the log. Bisgaard's assigning you to the case. What case? This ain't no case. That homeless mummy was probably living in that furnace and got stuck years ago. Case closed. Jensen! 3471 to base. Code Four here. Sync and corrections by n17t01 www.addic7ed.com Just tell me about her. Come on, Cath. Don't do this to me. As my friend, Mia. You know Bisgaard is insisting all victim pathology go through Dunn. Haley can't wait for you to sit for her tonight. You two are gonna watch Barbie And The Three Musketeers. Again. You know Dunn doesn't give a shit. Adrian Zaleski. Mother. Two boys, back in Russia. She immigrated to Pittsburgh. Her roommate thought she'd gone back. Kept that stuff all these years, in case she returned. Never even reported her missing. Her DNA popped up on CODIS because she was convicted on prostitution charges five years ago. She's been dead about two years. No external indication of cause of death. No gunshot, no knife wounds. Her arms. They were placed like that before she died? Well, I don't know, but they were definitely placed this way. Probably after. She'd been clawing at something. Traces of nickel and cadmium were under her nails. Preliminary soil analysis indicates those elements are not present at the factory. She was likely murdered... Somewhere else. At another location, yeah. _ Thomas: I committed my first murder at 18. I didn't kill again for nine years. At age... At age 30, I live alone in a Milwaukee apartment near my job at the Ambrosia Chocolate Factory. If you looked in my fridge... what would you find? Here's a hint. It's not a brain. It's comfort food. Yes. Correct. To Jeffery Dahmer, that made total sense. These minds are dark, monstrous forests to explore. You could get lost and never return. So... better take breadcrumbs. Dr. Schaeffer. Comfort food. You were late. I'm glad I could still pass, but I'm not a student. Catherine Jensen, Pittsburgh Homicide. Oh. This is a case I'm working on. I have a coat that looks just like this. Because you left it in the classroom, Doctor. I believe her arms were crossed after she was killed. Before. Good luck with your case. I'm sure you'll figure it out. I'm sure I will. Hey. Hey, you're okay. I want mommy. Mommy's on her way home now. Oh, my God, you're so sweaty. Your mommy's on her way. - Cath? - Yeah? Did you ever have nightmares about monsters? I had bad dreams about monsters all the time when I was little. Do you know what I would do when monsters came into my dreams? I'd try and scare 'em! I'd scream and yell until they were afraid and ran off. Then they leave you alone. You have to be worse than them. You want to pass me my glasses? They're in my coat. Yeah, sure. Thank you. You are useful for some things. Ha-ha-ha-ha. Ha-ha-ha-ha. Very funny. I'm a funny guy. You are tricky. _ So you found the folder? Did you know that an easy capacity to lie is one of the primary traits of a sociopath? Her arms... they were placed like that before the murder. Is that about control? You're asking the wrong question. What is the right question? Where are the others? Woman: Hey! Woman : Hey, baby girl, what you up to tonight? I just aced my first night school class. Okay, well, come celebrate and have drinks with me at the bar. I have to be up at work at 9:00. Oh, my God, it's, like, 10:30 PM. You don't realize this is the first day of work, and someone's on my other line. Grandma. We swept that entire factory and found nothing. You believe there are more bodies buried there? Bed? Bed. Nancy, I'm not lying to you. I'm in the school parking lot and my battery's dead, okay? You need to hang out with me sometime. Look, I'm calling AAA. Oh, come on. Hey, how you doing? Campus Security. You need a little help? You saved my life. I don't even know what I'm looking at. It could be the alternator. I-I think my battery's dead. But I don't... I don't really know. Oh, look, somebody just unhooked your battery cable. Look. Yeah, down there. Show me your hands! Geez! Schaeffer! God, you scared the hell out of me. What are you doing here? The vent is a terrible hiding place. It's too hard to get into. It shows he's inexperienced. But if he kept her here, then the others will be here, too. What are we looking for? Catherine?! You should see this. There's only two bolts here. These wrench marks on it. I'm gonna go back to the car, get a wrench. Yeah, or you could do it. I can't see anything. Let's go! These guys have all day, but we don't! Man : Commander Bisgaard is on the scene. First rule of officer safety. You can't protect yourself, you can't protect anyone. Don't ever do this again. I'm sorry, sir. I didn't... I know Lieutenant Dunn is in charge here... Dunn: The bodies were discovered over here, sir. Did you discover the bodies, Lieutenant Dunn? No, Commander. Detective Jensen did. Then Detective Jensen can show me where she found the bodies. This is now her case. So here's the deal. Every time this psycho kills someone, you're gonna feel responsible. And you should. There's no obvious physical pattern. Blonde, African-American... Asian... addict, prostitute, housewife. What? This leak to the papers or online? We haven't ID'd any of the victims. Thomas: These are obvious. Addict-- corrosive effects of methamphetamine on the teeth here. Syphilitic ulcers and human papilloma virus present on this one, consistent with prostitution. And the housewife has a wedding ring and a birthstone bracelet. This tab here brings up all reported missing females over the last six weeks in Allegheny, Westmoreland, Butler and Washington counties. I talked to Bisgaard. He's signed off on you joining the investigation - as a consultant. - Hmm. And do you have a problem with Bisgaard? No. No problem with Bisgaard. I actually thought he might have a problem with me. Wait. There. Same earrings. Lakasha Watkins. Hi. I'm Catherine. Benedicte. That's a great name. Well, I'll check out Lakasha Watkins. Good luck. - Here. - Is that for me? Yeah. How great you're so secure with our marriage you can bring all the "other women" into the house. No, she's a homicide detective. Works with Bisgaard. Just wanted a little advice. On an active case? Oh. Then I'd prefer she was the "other woman." There's no need to cry. You know why? 'Cause this is a happy story... with a happy ending. I'm gonna change your life. And what is the holdup on finding these factories that used cadmium and lead? Well, it's slow going because... Looks good. I'm thinking we should bring in a forensic psychologist. Call Russ, uh... What, uh...? What the hell's his name? Ketteringham. Russ Ketteringham at MIT. I'd like to bring on Thomas Schaeffer. I know there's a history there. History? That what that is? Schaeffer was responsible for my discovery of the four bodies at the factory. Schaeffer? No, no. He goes in too deep. He... makes leaps of logic. He's dangerous, people get hurt. So, you didn't actually talk to him about me. I think he would be of great benefit to my investigation. I thought he would be of great benefit to mine. No one felt worse about that than me, Frank. Actually, quite a few people felt worse than you, Schaeffer. Shh. See, I think... that being afraid comes from not knowing what's gonna happen next. So don't you be afraid. We both know what's going to happen. Please... please... Now, do like I said. Do like I said! Catherine: Mr. Watkins. Were you the only person with a key to your daughter's apartment? Watkins: Yes. That I know of. I'm sorry, I can't do this. You... y'all go in. It's okay. I'm not ready for this. Can't even imagine what you're going through. If we are gonna find out who did this to your daughter... Watkins: Okay. I am gonna have to ask you some questions. When was the last time you saw her? Watkins: About six weeks ago. I called-- nothing. I came here, knocked. Saw her car was gone. Got worried it might be Michael, so I called you, the police. Catherine: Who's Michael? Watkins: I never called him her husband. Husbands don't hit their wives. I got her this place and a used car. What kind of car was it? A Cavalier, green. It's what I could do to help her turn things around. She was really... She was a good girl. She was turning it around... ♪ oh-oh, I'm rising ♪ ♪ oh-oh-oh ♪ ♪ I'm rising to the top ♪ ♪ hey! hey! oh-oh... ♪ What are you doing? Her divorce settlement. The-the top sheet has been torn off. He's been in this room. When we find where he lives or kills them, that page will be there, I guarantee it. Lakasha was trying to improve her life. Her dad just said she left an abusive husband. She's sending her clothes to goodwill. Her iPod's loaded with nothing but motivational music. Her life is in transition. Adrian Zaleski is sending money back to Russia. Lakasha Watkins divorces her abusive husband. The victims were all trying to improve themselves. Which means... this guy... can come across these women whose lives are in transition. What if he's an invisible person? They're familiar with him, they've seen him before. He has a uniform. A repairman, a delivery person, a mailman, a nurse... Can't you feel it? Don't you...? Come on, it isn't paranormal or junk science or any of that shit. Can't you feel the residual energy of fear in this room? Left from the moment that she realized that the person that she let in here, the person that she thought she knew... was a lie. And that's the moment he gets off on. The second he is actually transforming somebody else's life. And they both know it. Did you ever trust anyone you shouldn't have? Yeah, yeah, we got, uh, two facilities in the area that use nickel cadmium. Uh, the first is an abandoned assembly plant out in Mayview; It's about a mile from the factory where we found the other bodies. You hungry? Go on in there! Eat your food! 3471. Man: Go ahead, 71. I'm at 1600 Mayview Road. The Mayview plant. Copy that, 71. Thomas! Green Cavalier. Lakasha Watkins' car. 3471 requesting backup. Ooh. You look so beautiful. Let me out of here! It's okay, I'm a police officer. I'm gonna get you out of here, okay? I'm gonna get you out. Come on. - Gonna get you out of here right now. - Here. Here's my coat. We're here to help you. Come on, it's okay. You're gonna be okay. It's okay. Shh. It's okay. Look at me. Go to the car, okay? We're gonna get you out of here. Take her to the car! It's over. That's it, I got you, I got you, got you. - 3471. - Go ahead, 71. Code Three. Keep those units coming. Wait, wait, wait! Wait, come back! Wait, don't leave, come back! Base, do you have a location on 3471? Man: Wait, lady, wait! Come back! Marlene! No! 3466 responding to backup call at the old Mayview plant. Catherine! Catherine, relax! I'm gonna get you out. Thomas, open it up! Open it up! Oh, get me out of here! No! Thomas, open it up! Open it up! Thomas! No! Thomas? No. No! Thomas! No... Molbeck: Down here! Down here! Sweep this room! Come on. I got ya. What are you doing?! What's wrong with you?! What's wrong with you? He's with us! Get your hands up! - He's with us. - You two, check that area. Come on, give me your hand. Jensen, what happened? You all right? I don't know. I got hit! Where's the girl? Up there! He's got her! - You guys got this! - Did you get him? Molbeck: No, we need a description. Catherine: I didn't see him! Molbeck: All units. Suspect still at large! Nearly hypothermic, unconscious, not comatose. Administer rewarming inhalations and monitor closely for signs of cardiac arrest. Catherine, Schaeffer, Marlene Anderson wasn't even reported missing, so I'm, uh... appreciative. Look... I'm not a lab rat for you to experiment on. If you ever do anything like that to me again, I'll pull this trigger. Hey, Frank, anyone volunteer for this shift at Margaret James Hospital? Figured you'd be here, so I brought Marlene's friend down. She's outside if you want to talk to her. Yeah, thanks. - Dr. Paster? - Yeah? Hi. My name's Eric. I'm from Kapp Security. I've been assigned to escort you - to Marlene Anderson's room. - Oh, okay. I'm-I'm sorry I'm crying. I know that Marlene felt bad about bailing on us all the time, but school was so important to her, and she really wanted to get good grades this semester. Oh. Yeah? Is there anyone, maybe an ex-boyfriend, who felt especially bad about her making a change in her life? No. She-she dated briefly in the summer, but no one serious. Yeah, I'm with Dr. Paster now. Mm-hmm, yep. - Uh, excuse me. - Did she say she saw anyone... Sorry. This is Dr. Paster. She just checked Marlene. Says her core temperature is... Actually, why don't you...? Her body temperature is rising. You might be able to question her later tonight. Dr. Paster, she's having some kind of a seizure or something. I need a crash cart in here! Watch out, please. Sorry. Wait! Who's this?! - What's he doing here?! - I'm just doing my job. I said I only wanted cops on this floor! He doesn't even have a gun! He was with Dr. Paster, Lieutenant. - He's from Kapp. - All right, let's, uh, let's go ahead and get him out of here. Come on. Thank you. Recharge. Paster: Do we have that other IV? Get me an amp of epi. CPR. What do we have? Do we have a pulse? She didn't make it. ♪ I watched the Moon hang in the sky ♪ ♪ I feel the traffic rushing by ♪ ♪ raging engine in the night... ♪ Who is it? It's Schaeffer. ♪ I'm still waiting for you... ♪ The coffin creates a slow suffocating death... like his own life. He kills them because he can't improve his life, so he won't allow them to improve theirs. That's what I learned from what I did to you. And if you ever pull a gun on me again... Do you want a beer? A beer? Comes in a bottle. Gets you drunk. Or white wine, which gets me drunk. Sure, I'll take a beer. ♪ I'm still here waiting for you... ♪ _ It's my older brother David. ♪ waiting for you ♪ Is that John Wayne Gacy's house? Labianca House, Los Angeles. That's Jeffrey Dahmer's childhood home. And this one I don't know. Whose is it? I probably could have got you out of there a little faster. Maybe I went overboard with the gun. Did you... learn anything... being inside the box? Just what I've always known. You have to be worse than they are. Then you would probably be dead. He's aroused by any display of emotion. If those girls had known to... be completely blank, stone-faced, show him that he doesn't control them, maybe they'd still be alive. Maybe. It's late. I know. He's still out there. Let's go back to the plant in the morning. You can pick me up around 8:00, skip the downtown traffic? Okay. Thomas. I've been locked in a box before. Good night. Good night. Thomas! Officer down. Thomas: Catherine! Catherine? He took her gun. Bisgaard, it's Schaeffer. He's got Catherine. I think I know who it is. You see this? Your badge? Mine. You? Mine. You have nothing! Okay, Schaeffer, what makes you so sure? I believe that he wears a uniform. Most of the victims trusted him initially. So maybe a security guard. We know that this subject collects trophies. Catherine's commendation was gone. She accosted him at the hospital, Frank, reminded him that he wasn't a cop and he didn't carry a gun. She humiliated him. I know that you're afraid. They're always afraid. They teach you how to do that? Wait. Did Kapp Security work the steel mill demolition site? - Frank, if they worked security... - Hey, did you guys ever... ...at the steel mill demolition site, then it is definitely him. That's how he found where to hide the bodies. Well, did Krogh? It's him. Open it! Open it! Get in! Get in the box! These are Eric Krogh's Kapp duty assignments over the last eight weeks. Got Allegheny Community College, Robinson Towne Center... See you soon. Units have been dispatched to Consol Energy Center, Robinson Towne Center, PNC, Allegheny General Hospital, Heinz Field... Well, what about this one? This one has since been torn down. And that's way out in Westmoreland and that's been shut down. Westmoreland Psychiatric. Yeah. It's a place where people were sent to try and get better. 69 to Base... Molbeck: Unit 69 to Base. Requesting backup, Westmoreland Psychiatric Hospital. There. There. Thomas, stay behind me. Stay behind me! Krogh: When the air goes stale... when there is no more air, you'll start to get sleepy. And you'll know that if you sleep, you'll die. And we both know that you're going to die. - Come on. - Relax. - Come on. - Hang on, stay behind me. Move it, Molbeck. Krogh: I'll give you air... if you cross your arms. That's her! Move! There she is! Catherine! Thomas! Molbeck: Get back! - Catherine! - Get back! Thomas! Thomas, he has a gun! Catherine: Thomas! Don't move! Let me see your hands! I got you, I got you. You're okay, you're okay. Put your hands behind your back! - I got you, I got you... - No! No, no! No, no, no! Let me see your hands! - Cross your arms! Thomas: - No! Cross your arms! Thomas: Catherine... - Cross your arms! - Don't be worse than them. Don't be worse than them. No! Catherine: Get Molbeck out of here. Call it in! Molbeck: I'm just cut, I'm just cut. Thomas, get an ambulance! Get him out of here! Turn over. Cross your arms. Cross 'em. Officer shooting investigative protocol requires that any time a... an officer discharges their weapon, or a suspect is killed in custody, an investigation is initiated. We need a statement from you both. Do not talk to Schaeffer. Thank you. A case went down. Good job, Catherine. I don't want you to get jammed up. I want you to protect yourself. You're entitled to a union rep - and a lawyer. - What do I have to be afraid of? In my office. _ _ _ _
