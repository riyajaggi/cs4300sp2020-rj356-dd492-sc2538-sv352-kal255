 - Previously on Those Who Kill: - This was Howard's house. Never felt like home. Howard killed my brother. You have no evidence of this. That's why I need you. The killer will usually take a souvenir, a personal object or a trophy, which he will then display to show off his superiority. I'm gonna help you. He's guilty of something. I just don't know what.

 Schaeffer became obsessed with having been wrong. His wife had him committed. - She pulled him through it. - I won't let anyone hurt him. It's not anyone. It's him. Are you sure you want to do this, Catherine? I've been working for years to this moment. I'm ready. Your mother knows. She's always known. Oh. Just what I need. What, you find your toy box? 'Cause we could use some more batteries. Duquesne isn't turning on the power until Wednesday.

 Probably couldn't find the switch for this place. Was it really that bad at your parents' condo that you couldn't wait until Wednesday? You're the one that pushed me to find a new place. I wasn't thinking the Batcave. If your house still belonged to your ex-husband, do you think you could stand to live there for another day? Yeah. If he was buried in the backyard. And the rent was free. Maybe. The rent wasn't free. Howard charged me $25 a month to live there, just to teach me to be responsible. You know I know that's still free rent. - Mm-hmm. - It annoyed me so much, I'd write all the checks for a whole year in one night and put them in envelopes just so I wouldn't have to think about it. Oh, he's such a jag-off. Why did you put with that? I have no idea. That's the kind of thing I could see Dennis doing to Hailey. I'm surprised he doesn't charge her when he has her for his weekends. What the hell is that? - Aah! - What the hell? Seriously... what is up with you? Sync and corrections by explosiveskull www.addic7ed.com You've certainly outdone yourself tonight, honey. I'm sure my eyes are bigger than my stomach. Honey? - Honey. - Thank you, honey. You work so hard for us. I wanted to make your favorite. Well, thank you, dear. That's nice of you. Son? Could you pass the carrots, please? You little shit! My preliminary investigation into Howard Burgess finds the presence of two of Finkelhor's four factors of pedophilia: blockage and disinhibition. Every case I've ever researched has always been after. After the murder has been committed. Years after the killer has been created by whatever factors. Examining crime scene photos, interview killers or their surviving victims. Study published findings in psychology journals. Always after. Catherine Jensen... is happening before my eyes. Ooh. Shooting Eric Krogh, I believe... was to see if she could do it. And she got her answer. But here... in this room at a late hour, I must admit, for me... Catherine Jensen is how an astronomer might feel if able to observe a nebula of gas and dust forming, and then igniting into a star. And yet... I hesitate to commit to her. I'm afraid of either answer. Did she find me? Or somehow, did I find her? There's gonna be a coaching change, I'm telling you right now. Whoa, ho, ho... Check out the shine on that detective's pants. You know, five years riding shotgun on patrol with her and she forgets all about us once she hits the big time. So, hey, Eddie, how was it getting that cat out of a tree? Did you call SWAT in on that? It's good to see you, CJ. What are you doing here so early? Um... Hey, how's Jen? She's great. Hung that painting you did in the living room... looks great. Tell her I say hi. How's Bisgaard treating you? I hear he can be a real ball buster. Oh. Don't be hard on him. He's treating me okay. Word is he's getting kicked upstairs to assistant chief. Where's that leave you? Leaves me still missing my brothers in blue. You okay, CJ? Did you come to see us? Did you come home because you need to talk something over? I'm just checking in with the family. All units, Code 3. 316 Glenview. Multiple homicides. - Uh, yeah, let me call you back. - That's us. - Yeah, I gotta go. - Be safe. Patrol secured the crime scene. You're the first detective on site. You're the mom. You're supposed to protect me. I don't think I'm much of a protector. Who called you? How'd you get here so fast? Oh, I went to work early; I heard the call. Yeah? You call in the body snatchers? Uh, not yet. You got that number? Got a new phone, and my contacts are all screwed up. The I.T. kid was... Mia, it's Catherine. Got three bodies. 316 Glenview. Right. Can you send me that number so I got it? Sure. Thanks, Jensen. Chief. What have we got? Cartridges, no gun, no wallet, no keys. No car in the driveway, no dad in the house. Got to be the dad. It's always the dad. Slow down. Robert Warner... runs in the circles with the deputy chief's son. He's a trustee on the board of a domestic violence shelter. So you think he slowed down when she begged him not to kill her... kill her kids? Don't give me that. I've already got units out looking for his SUV. We just have to be right. You know the facts, Chief. 90% it's the dad. Always the dad. Are you hungover or pregnant? Families make me barf. Hello? Thomas, it's Catherine. I'm at a homicide crime scene. Bisgaard wants you in. If you're up for it. Where are you? 316 Glenview, Squirrel Hill. Let him in. Two children are dead in their rooms. The mother, in her bedroom. I'd like your thoughts on this, Schaeffer, and I'd appreciate discretion and tact. Always, Commander. Upstairs. He killed the children quickly, slit their throats. But he spent time on the mother, beat her. Then strangled her. Can we cover the body, please? I'm sorry. Not yet. Any incidents of domestic violence involving the father? Rumors, even? She may not have reported them. She may have known but kept it quiet. Bankruptcy? Foreclosure? Job loss? Not that we've discored in the time we've been investigating. With family annihilators, it's either about their failure or revenge on the spouse. 90% of them are male. They usually execute the children in front of the mothers so that the mothers are forced to watch. Was she raped? Vaginally. An annihilator wouldn't typically exhibit that type of behavior. He'd have sodomized her to humiliate her. And then when he'd killed her, more often than not, he'd kill himself. There were no signs of forced entry. They have an alarm system. It wasn't set off. It was shut off. There appears to be a gun missing from the drawer. So why didn't he use it? On them? On himself? I mean, we should definitively be looking for Robert Warner, but... something doesn't... quite sit right. Don't project onto this case. Everyone likes to believe that there's nothing deeper than family. Wasn't my experience, and it looks like it wasn't hers, either. Jensen. Oops. Hey. How was picking John up from school? B, I'm sorry. Look... I don't understand when my son is made to sit in a room for an hour waiting for the neighbor to pick him up again. We have to talk. When you were in the hospital, you promised: no more active cases. What happened to that? Uh, well... we could use the money that the consulting brings in. What good is the money if you're not with us? You're drifting again. I recognize it. Admit it. I was called in this morning to consult on a wife and two children who had been murdered in their beds. Just in Squirrel Hill. How does anyone do such a thing? What must it be like to... creep through your house and kill your entire family? It violates every law of... humanity, evolution, genetics. I can't imagine what it would be like. But I know I can help to stop it. I believe you. And I love you because you sincerely believe in that goal. But you'll never know that you accomplished that goal because you will have gone insane long before. Hey. Did you get my text? Uh, no. Um... can you get away? There's a networking thing going on at the office. 31st Street Pub. I need a drink. We'll figure something out. System armed. What are you doing? Give me the knife. Okay, I want you to take a look at yourself, and then profile yourself, and then profile me, and tell me, for the love of God, why I'm not walking out of this house with our son. Hey, hey, it's okay. Back to sleep. Hey. Have, uh, you been here before? Syd? Scotch. Neat. Syd? Is she vicious? Syd just gets me my drinks. We're not on a two-syllable basis. Oh, I see. At least you don't know anyone here, and I doubt anyone here knows you. Yeah. Good. Yeah. - Bands play here. - Ah. Punk mostly. Cool. I saw Nickelback. Uh, I don't know if that's... It... it was a long time ago, when I was a kid. When did you stop being a kid? So long ago, I don't remember. You make me feel like a kid, though. Bet you were a bad kid. No. I wasn't bad at all. Ever. You? I never got the chance to be a kid. Want something to drink? Okay. Um, can I have an Iron City, please... Syd? - Iron City? - Iron City. It's made right here in our fine commonwealth. My buddies and I... that's our drink, uh, ever since college. Actually, I have this funny photo. We get together every year. Um, it's kind of stupid, but... Wait. Go back. Your wife? Yeah. She's pretty. She is. Laura. You're pretty. - I don't need that. - I know. I wasn't just passing out a compliment. It's just a fact. Believe me, you'll know when I'm just giving out a compliment. You guys friends? My wife and I? Yeah. I'm friends with my kids, too. My whole family. They make you happy? Very. Just, me being here with you has nothing to do with her. You make me happy in a... in a different way. What about you? Do you have somebody? Fam... like, brothers or sisters, or...? Um, yeah, I have a brother. He, uh... he lives in Europe... Paris. He works in fashion. We're close. Very close, but... I don't get to see him very much 'cause he lives so far away. Yeah? It's Thomas. I'm at the Warner house. I need you to let me in. There's something I have to see. Ten minutes. I got to go. It's work. At 10:00 at night? You never told me what you do. I'm a double agent. I have to meet Putin downtown in the Tap Room at the William Penn. Ah, okay. Is that a girlfriend signal? Like, "I'll call you at 10:00, and if he's wearing tan pants, you can tell him you have to go to work"? Next time. Forensics went over the basement. So did you and I. Patrol checked the exterior panels. Yeah, but we didn't look under the house. What if the killer was already in the house? That would explain why the alarm wasn't set off. What do you got? Looks like someone's been living down here. Hmm. And has been watching up there. It's registered to Robert Warner. All right, hurry up if you want a ride. The Daddy Train's leaving. Put your coat on, buddy. What, I don't even get a hug? - Come on. - I don't want to. I don't care if you want to. - Love you, Mom. - Love you. Bye, Mom. - Bye, honey. - Love you. Love you. Wait. Wait, wait. B. Look, uh... you're-you're right. I understand. I... No. We've had that conversation. You were standing over our son with a knife. It is what it is. I have to accept the fact that you're gonna do whatever you're gonna do regardless of what I say. I have a child to think about and another on the way. And as much as I love you, I have to put them first. Ow. Hello? Are you okay? Is your family having breakfast? What? Did Laura make you breakfast, or did your girls? I mean, do you guys eat breakfast all together, or...? Every family does it differently. Yeah. Okay, let me... I'll call you later. Hi. You've reached Paul Cavallo. Please leave a message. Sorry, Paul. I... I wasn't trying to cause any drama or seem like some crazy cat lady. I just... I just really wanted to know. Thanks for coming down. It's hard to get away. Weekends are always busy. Gunshots, stabbings, suicides. I found a pair of Steelers earrings in a woman's stomach. Must be a Browns fan that lost a bet. Right? Robert Warner had a wife and kids. Faults, I'm sure, but hopes and dreams, too. For him and his kids. This is how it ends for him. Unless you help finish his story. That's right. We finish the story. The corpses I autopsy are more on time than you. They have fewer options on what clothes to wear. You were right about one thing. Trajectory of the bullet confirms it wasn't a suicide. Multiple bruises and abrasions indicate a struggle. Given the level of decomposition, I'd place time of death about 72 hours ago. There were four place settings. And Margaret was raped. Not by her husband. Not his semen. But it does match samples from the bedding in the crawl space. He was watching her from under the house. Through the vents. Fantasizing. Robert was an obstacle. Remove the obstacle, he's free to act out on the object of his desires. For four days? You saw the foodstuffs under the house, all that bedding. He was down there for a long time before the abduction, building a relationship with her in his mind. It explains the level of rage he directed toward her. Whatever she did to anger him, he took it personally. Kevin? That man. Just got a match on prints from the Warner house. Guy by the name of Toby Gunder. Priors for B and E and sexual assault. P.O. says he works for an outfit called Bugs-Out Exterminators. - If anyone knows their way around crawl spaces, huh? - Yeah. Well, the owner says he hasn't showed up to work in days. But I got this list of all the jobs he's worked in the last two months and... check this out... three weeks ago, the Warner house. I'll call down. Hello? Hi, Beth. Yeah, what time does it start? Okay. Need me to bring anything? Kevin? Kevin? I suck so hard at golf. We'll eat as soon as the kids get back. Great. Okay, so, how about cookies? Ice cream? Cake? Just got a hit on Big Toby's truck. 31st down by the bridge. What about Jensen and Schaeffer? Ah, what do we need Scooby-Doo for anyways? He's gonna burn some sage and hug some crystals? Well, Catherine's gonna want to be on this collar. Hey, teacher's pet gets plenty of free passes from the commander. Let's make this collar ours. Come on. But what if she goes to Bisgaard because we went behind her back? We ain't got shit to worry about from Detective Jensen. Brian? Bri? Bri? The trailer right there. Hey, buddy. What you reading? History. Civil War. Look, I'm, uh... I'm sorry that I left you stranded at school yesterday. Okay. You know, maybe we should take a trip to Gettysburg. I'm already going there with my school next month. Look, I know I haven't been around a lot lately, and... maybe it seems like I don't care, but I want you to know that... there's nothing more important to me than you... or your mom. John? Buddy? You ever want to talk about anything... I'm here. Okay? What the hell is he doing? We found Warner two blocks from here, yeah? Maybe he's moving another body. Eh, let's do this. Put your hands on your head! Put your hands on your head! - Interlace your fingers. - Put your hands on the gate of the truck! On the gate! Let's go! Gate of the truck. That's it. You don't have a warrant. Shut up! "To Robert. "Happy anniversary. Love, Maggie." You grave-robbed this, right? One of your clients, Robert Warner... was it worth killing him for? And his wife and two kids? Whoa, whoa, what? Yeah, that's what I mean. Hold on. When was that? Three nights ago. Friday, I was at the slag bar. I'm a bouncer there Friday and Saturday nights. You ask Anthony. I mean, he'll tell you... Get back! I'm on the security cameras. All night long. You want to tag me for that stuff, I get it. But I ain't no killer. I'm Catholic. Get him out of here. You have the right to remain silent. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to speak with an attorney. Hi. This is Marie Burgess. Please leave a message and I'll call you back. I know that you know. Well, you've done it again, dear. Steak's rare. Mashed potatoes. And green beans are so good for you, aren't they, sweetie? Yes. Yes, what? Yes... Daddy. Dear? Would you like to say grace? Bless us, O Lord, and these, thy gifts, which we are about to receive from thy bounty. Through Christ, our Lord. Amen. Sync and corrections by explosiveskull www.addic7ed.com
