 Previously on Those Who Kill... And I don't remember the first time it started. It just happened. And I was so young, I didn't understand what was happening. But somehow I knew that it shouldn't be happening. I don't know why I never did anything to help my brother. I'll never forgive myself for it. Howard killed my brother. I'm gonna help you. Your mother knows. Please leave a message and I'll call you back.

 I know that you know. Write your cell here. It's a one-time deal. You guys friends? My wife and I? Yeah. Is your family having breakfast? What? Are we going down the rabbit hole again? How was picking John up from school? We have to talk. I was called in this morning to consult on a wife and two children who had been murdered in their beds. How does anyone do such a thing?

 Maggie Warner was raped-- not by her husband. It wasn't a suicide. What if the killer was already in the house? And he's been watching up there. He was watching her from under the house. Fantasizing, building a relationship with her in his mind. Well, you've done it again, dear. Would you like to say grace? Sleep tight, sweetie. Good night, buddy. Don't let the bedbugs bite. Both kids are out like a light. Man, what a day, huh? You know, no matter how crazy things get at work... I always make it through because I know I have you to come home to. I know a lot of guys don't have what I have. I am so... lucky. So... so lucky. I love you so much. Sync and corrections by n17t01 www.addic7ed.com Go set them up, Thomas. Why do I always have to do it? Because I'll put a BB up your butt if you don't. One's gone. It's probably back there. Cut it out! Dad said we can only shoot cans! I'm not scared of Dad. He's not here. How's he gonna know? It's in that tree. Crap! Lucky shot. Check this. What are you doing?! You killed their mom. They were gonna die anyway. He's copped to nine robberies-- all clients of Bugger-Out Exterminators, including Robert Warner. He, uh, denies any involvement in the murder though. Who'd have thought? Well, bartender at The Slag Bar confirms he worked both Friday and Saturday night as a bouncer. He's all over the security camera. He's, uh... he's not our guy. Jensen on the same page? Haven't, uh, really talked to her about it yet. She seems wound a bit tight lately. Anything I should know about? Look, Commander, you... you know I love Jensen. She's a freakin' sister to me, but... yeah, lately there's been a... a disconnect. I'm sensing... I don't know. She seems distracted, so, yeah... I'm worried about her. Well, thanks, Jerry. We'll keep an eye on her then. Hey. I made coffee. Are there pacifiers in the freezer? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got her, I got her. - She is cranky. - Yeah? Hi, ladies. - You get ready. I don't think I remember the last time I actually slept through a night. - Can I have some coffee? - Do you have a driver's license? No. My soccer game is this Saturday. Saturday? Panthers are on TV, baby. You can DVR that game. My game is not on TV. I wouldn't miss your game if I was playing for Pitt, honey. The bus is gonna be here any minute. - Oh. - Never mind. Here, here. Okay. Ready. Bus will be here in... two minutes. And I can't take you. You guys got to make it today. I cannot get you there today. - Okay. - Sorry, what time tonight? Well, it could be lunchtime, but I don't know if I'm gonna be back... Hey, Jensen. Your mother, line one. Call back. Heard you had a big night. Thought we had a lead on the killer, but turned out to be a bust. The bust was a bust? Funny. Maggie Warner's autopsy report. Alumina. Get out here. Alumina? Found under her fingernails, along with the killer's skin. She must have scratched him, so... while you finish up your paperwork on the Bugger-out Burglar, I'm gonna see if my lead can help us find our killer. Al2-O3, or alumina, is the primary element used in the clay in the masonry work. We also found paint residue on Maggie's body and in the bed. So he's a carpenter or a manual laborer? Strong bastard, too, judging from the beating he gave her. But she put up a fight. Well, she was trying to protect her children. Something happens to you when you become a mother. It's like somebody cut your heart out and it's walking around outside your body. I don't know what I would do if something happened to Hailey, but I know I would die for her.

No, it's... it's okay. Thanks. Hey, you can drop me off at Mike's house if you want, and I can go with him. His mom's always late. Well, we're both gonna be late for school today, buddy. Hmm? Hey. There she is. Yeah. Smile for me, Ruthie. Huh? Come on. Smile. There you go. There you go. That's it. That's so much better. Schaeffer thinks the killer has a thing for Maggie Warner. Right. We've gone through every connection-- school, work, gym, friends. What if the answer's right in front of us? In what way? Al2-O3, or alumina. It's used in building materials. There were paint chips on Maggie's body. Stuff you'd find at a construction site. Yeah, but the, uh, Warner house wasn't under construction. No, but the neighbor's was. Look, I know you think you're a man now, and, despite my desire to slow down the clock... you are growing up in front of my eyes. We're gonna have a... man-to-man talk, okay? You have an uncle. My brother. My older brother. His name is Nathan. And he's behind those walls. Oh, is he a guard? No. He killed someone, John. His wife. Your aunt. And he's serving a 15-year sentence for manslaughter. Why are you telling me this now? I was gonna put them back, I swear. John, all kinds of people are gonna lie to you in your life. Almost everybody. Let's not do it to each other. Let's have a safe place for the truth. You and me, okay? Do you look at the crime scene photos at the same time as you look at the photos of the girls? Do you mix them? Do you feel excited when you look at them at the same time? No, I don't look at them at the same time. That would be... gross. But I just... I have a hiding place, and that's where I hide stuff. There's only ever two reasons to hide stuff... because it's private or because it's wrong. The photos of the girls I understand. I used to do the same thing. But we told you not to take the other photos. I know. You have to trust that when your parents say to stay away from something, it's for your own good. Your uncle didn't. And look where he ended up. Look, John, I want us to make a pact between you and me that we'll always have this safe place where we can talk about things that other people might not understand. Okay? I just... I love you so much. And I want you to know that I'm your safe place. Can I meet him someday? You're not seriously suggesting that one of my guys did this? You had a crew working near the crime scene. Maybe somebody saw something that could help us out. I'll be happy to put you in touch, but... I check people out pretty good before I hire them. Well, you don't have to be Mother Teresa to swing a hammer. No, but I work in people's homes, and I don't need the liability that comes with the screw-offs. If a guy gets douchey on the job, I toss him. Has there been any douchiness in the past month or so? Well, there was one guy. His contracting business went belly-up during the recession. Thought he was God's gift, but... he couldn't set a plumb line. He didn't even have his own wheels. He hitchhiked to and from Home Depot every day. Yeah. Rodney Bosch. I canned his ass when a... husband at a remodeling site caught him peeping on his wife. That site wouldn't be in Squirrel Hill, would it? Rodney Bosch? Pittsburgh Police! Show yourself. Jesus. - First, this little... - Sorry, that's my fault. - Yeah, these are mine. - Come on, Daddy. No, I'm-I'm filming. Roddie, come on, please? Mm-mm. Mm-mm. Please? Wife and two kids, just like the Warners. He killed his family, then sat here and watched them. All right. Well, so... Get on the couch. Where are we, Ruthie? We're in Heaven. Where are we? We're in Heaven. We're in Heaven. We're in Heaven. Where are we, Ruthie? I don't know. Ruthie, where are we? Look in the camera. Where are we? I d... I don't kn... Look in the camera. Where are we, Ruthie? We're in Heaven. Heaven. We're in Heaven. Ruthie, we're in Heaven. Heaven. You and me in Heaven. Heaven. - This is Heaven, Ruthie. - Heaven. This is Heaven. This is Heaven. It's... Heaven. So pretty. I'm never gonna let you down. Jack. What? Get that camera off me. Just wait. What... What is this? ♪ For he's a jolly good daddy ♪ ♪ For he's a jolly good daddy ♪ ♪ For he's a jolly good daddy ♪ ♪ Which nobody can deny. ♪ Happy birthday, Dad. Oh, God. You shouldn't have. This is too much. Make a wish, make a wish. Okay. It's marble. It's your favorite. You're the best, Ruthie... kids. I look around this table and I think I must be the luckiest man in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. Josie, um, go get Mommy some-some towels. No, no, no, she made the mess. She can clean it up. Roddie, please. You can't even keep this from me for five minutes! Not one second... There now, Roddie. ♪ That's my sweet birthday boy ♪ ♪ Josie loves her daddy. ♪ - Roddie? - Mm. Is this Heaven? No. It's Pennsylvania. That's right. It's Pennsylvania. It's Pennsylvania. It's Pennsylvania. It's Iowa. Field of Dreams? Kevin Costner says "It's Iowa" when his dead dad asks if the cornfield is Heaven. Oh, come on. I know The Notebook. You should know Field of Dreams. I don't know The Notebook. It's Pennsylvania. Mmm. Here, come eat your cake. - It's my favorite. - It is... This is Rodney? And his wife, Ruth; kids, Jack and Josie. I found them in their beds. They'd been dead about a month or so. Josie, I love you guys. - We love you, too. - Yeah. It's not just a fixation on the wife. It's the whole family. Rodney Bosch took over the family's construction business after his father's death. Ran it into bankruptcy. Yeah, eight months back mortgage, 120 grand in the hole. He was already cracking under pressure when his wife Ruth filed for a divorce last month. This guy is trying to reconstruct his version of the perfect family. Since no such thing exists... He's doomed to fail. And so the pattern cycles. - How soon? - He's already cycled twice in a matter of weeks, and as his psychosis deepens, he'll become less tolerant of deviations to his ideal, giving the next targets an even smaller margin for error. We do, at least, know that he has a type. He looks for a wife, 30, 35, blonde, petite, two kids, upward mobility, nice homes, all the trappings of success. He's on foot. No car, no money. Last known address was the Warner basement. So we've identified a search radius around that location, with special focus on the other Darset Construction sites in the area. Okay. Let's go door to door undercover. Mail carriers, gas readers. Let's roll. You know, breakfast is the day's most important meal. You know what, Josie? I think... pancakes sound really important. Right? Pancakes would hit the spot this morning. Sound good, Josie? Yeah. Yes, pancakes sound important. Maybe you two could help Mom cook for Daddy. Yes. Always be good to your mother. Always. Jack. You, too, honey. No. Jack stays with me. I see you have a lot of video games. Come on, let's go play some. Come on. Oh, and don't forget the syrup. Lots of butter. Butter's very important for you. Come on, Jack. Nobody home. Mark it. We'll try back later. Hey, Wilkie, you buy this wireless crap at RadioShack and pocket the change? Hey, you try doing this on a city budget. You have a real knack for this. Surveillance? Motherhood. I will shoot you. Come on, Jack. You can try harder than that. We've got to do what he says, honey. I'll think of something, I promise. What are you doing? What do you take me for a jag off? You think that the only way I can win is if you throw the game? Am I a loser to you? You-you... you think I'm a loser, Jack? My name is Brian, and you're not my dad! You ungrateful little shit. You're an ungrateful little... No! You turned them against me. You wanted them to love you more, so you turned them against me. Please. Please just don't hurt my children. They're my children. Oh, no, no. You... you say they're my children. Come on. Say they're my...! Say they're my children. Babe... Hi. Uh, I got a package for a Kevin and Donna Russell? I'm... Donna. I'm also, uh, tracking down a missing package. Uh, it wouldn't have, uh, landed on your doorstep, would it? No. Are you sure? 'Cause I can grab it and take it off your hands. I told you, you have the wrong house. Okay, there's something definitely wrong here. What the hell are you doing, Jensen? He'll know if the delivery guy goes back again. Donna? Donna, it's Cathy from next door. I have a question about my Lucy. It'll just take a second. See that rash on her leg? I was wondering if your kids ever had anything like it. There, Jerry. Oh, please. He has my children. Jensen, get out of there! Hey, Roddie. Cathy is such a pest. I didn't think I'd ever get rid of her. Tell me, Roddie. Is this Heaven? No. It's Pennsylvania. Tactical, clear the neighborhood houses and set up a perimeter. Catherine, what's his state of mind? You look tired, Roddie. What a creep Darset is. I mean, he works you so hard 'cause he knows he's a fraud. You protect him. And he'd be nothing without you. Someday, you'll show him. You'll be running that business in no time. Yeah, that's good. Feed his fantasy. I mean... ...I am so lucky to have such a handsome husband like you. Loves his family so much, and works so hard to make us all feel safe and happy in our beautiful home. You know, there's a lot of deadbeat dads out there who don't care about their families. Your dad gets up every day and goes to work to make sure we have a roof over our head and food on the table. I mean, you should have anything you want. Any way you want it. I'm hungry... and I've been waiting. Well, we should get some breakfast going then, shouldn't we? Josie, I know you're Daddy's girl, but sometimes Mommy needs her little helper in the kitchen. Roddie... you think Josie could help me in the kitchen? Sure. I know it's hard to peel away from your favorite parent, but... Catherine, what's going on? She's in the kitchen with me. He has the boy in the living room, but he's got a knife. We're positioning a sniper. You need to clear both kids and isolate him in the back of the house. Look, stay close to me, okay? When I say run, you run. Jack? You're gonna be late for school. Go and get ready. No, no, no. Rodney's kids were homeschooled. Just because they learn at home doesn't mean they should go running around looking like orphans. Right? Go wash up. No! Breakfast. What does everybody want? Does it not get old being you? I mean, how many times does a person have to ask for something around here? He wants pancakes. I'm sorry, honey. Right. My mind was elsewhere. The mother says the windows in the kitchen overlook the backyard. If Catherine can get him to the table, we can put a sniper in those woods behind the house. Do it. Catherine, we need you to get Rodney into the kitchen-- table in front of the windows. Repeat, the table in front of the windows. Do you copy? You're so pretty. Anything I want? What is that? In your ear. What is that? Oh, uh... I was listening to NPR. You don't like the ones I bought you? I wear those to the gym. The ones you got me are so much better. Catherine, do you copy? What happened? She's not responding. Now, where'd I put that flour? I think we should go in. If we crash in, it'll set him off. He's using the boy as a shield. Damn it, Jack. Come on. Breakfast is almost ready. Oh. Oh. John. Call your dad. Chief. It was in the buggy. She's unarmed. He's not answering. Call 911. Oh! 911. State your emergency. Help me. My mom-- she's hurt. No, she's still breathing, but she's hurt bad. Hurry. Josie. Come to Daddy. Here we are. I know what you're doing. Playing all sweet and happy. But you're laughing at me behind my back. You're gonna leave me. Take the kids, humiliate me. You hurt me when you say things like that. Do you want to hurt us? I'm the mother of your children. My job is to protect them. To protect you. Why are we even talking about this? Position six, you've got a green light. It's such a nice day out. She's opened the curtains. Tactical, await my command. Let's start our day together, as a family. See, I did... I did everything I was supposed to do. My dad said, "Work hard," you know? "Good things happen." But... ...they don't, really. I mean, it was never... never good enough for him. "You're a loser, Rod. You're an idiot. You're never gonna be anything." He's gone, Roddie. Your dad is gone. You don't have to worry about him anymore. It's just you and me and our kids. I know, but he lied to me, Ruthie. I mean, my own parent lied. One day very soon, no one will lie to you ever again. Have I let you down? You could never let me down. You believe in me? You know I do. Let's just sit down together at the table. Tell me what's on your mind. I'm here to listen. Someone who listens. Hey, kids. Jack, Josie. Come sit. Most important meal of the day. Roddie, why don't you sit there. Since you're the head of the family. That's your seat. I've got him, but the kids... Take the shot. Roger that. Is this Heaven? It's okay, I got you. Come here, come here, come here. You're safe. It's over, okay? You're safe. Are you okay? Placental abruption. Caught it in time, thanks to John. He found me and called 911. Might have saved us both. I'm so proud of you, buddy. B... ...I swear I'm never gonna let anything take me away from you or this family ever again. Catherine, what are you doing here? Your wife has a beautiful singing voice. What? What, uh... Don't forget Sarah's soccer game. How did you find me? Catherine, you're freaking me out, Don't make me call the police. Look, it was fun. You're a good guy and you have a nice family. So don't screw it up. Bye, Cheese Dad. Hi, this is Marie Burgess. Please leave a message and I'll call you back. Hey, Mom, it's me. Call me, okay? We need to talk about Howard. Sync and corrections by n17t01 www.addic7ed.com
