 This spiked MDMA is very unique. Space Cowboy. Didn't you used to know a guy in Narcotics? Yeah, I used to know his brains out. You didn't kill Caroline Henson. There are two people who know that. There are three-- you, me, and the man who sent this. I think the man who actually killed Caroline Henson read my book and was offended. He sent that postcard to your house. I'm working this case, Frank. I'm staying. And I'm assigning you protection. That's Henson's blood work.

 The spike is Ecstasy, MDMA. - I need a ViCAP search. - I found 19 women who went missing from the cities and dates you gave me, and 19 men who went missing with them. The women all look the same because that's what he's attracted to. And the men? We should be checking the sewers. Abbey and Parker Fulton, married less than a year. No one's heard from them. Please! No! I'm so sorry for your loss. Thank you for coming. You were such a good friend to her. Appreciate it. Thanks for coming. When you're young and there's a knock on the door, you ask, "Who is it?!" And then, when you're older, and there's a knock on the door, you ask, "Oh, who is it?" But Marie always answered every door with hope and warmth, even when her firstborn ran away. She only loved Catherine and me more. And she never gave up hope that David would come home again some day. First time I saw Catherine and David, her children-- that's when I truly fell in love with her. To see this bright, beautiful, single mother, struggling, fighting, giving everything to provide for her children... it was then that I knew that she was not only a woman of uncommon grace, but of uncommon character, as well. And in time, I would realize that she was the rock that held our family together. There would be times when I... He never would have missed this. If he were alive, he would have been here. Now I'm certain. My brother's dead, and Howard killed him. Sync and corrections by n17t01 www.addic7ed.com Please, let me go! - How's it going? - Dave. - Detective Molbeck. - Pleasure. Here you go. What exactly you looking for? Ravens fans. Hope you're not looking for a gun. Every time you guys can't find the murder weapon, they send some poor schmuck down here to check the traps. No. We got a killer who dumps his victims in the sewer. You ain't gonna find what you're looking for here. - Why's that? - No solids. Nothing that don't float makes it this far. Solids like metal and glass get filtered out up system. Wood don't last, neither. The solvents we pump in at the north side-- they break down organics, so, wood, paper, road kill-- it's mush when it comes through here. Trap mesh breaks it right up. So, there's 24 traps down here. Gonna take you a while to check 'em all. Wait. Me? You're the schmuck of the day, right? Those are the schmuck of the day suits. If you fall in, keep your mouth shut. Have a good one, bud. Oh, Catherine! There you are. Come here. I wanted to talk to you a minute. Don't blame yourself. I mean, you-you were the brave one. - You're drunk. - No, listen. She was suffering. And when someone that you love is in pain, it doesn't matter whether it's emotional or physical. You do what you have to do. Out of love. You understand that now. Excuse me. I'm-I'm so sorry to interrupt. Oh, no, no, this is, um, Sheryl. This is my daughter Catherine. It's nice to meet you. I'm-I'm... I'm so sorry for your loss. Thank you. Matthew just wanted to say good-bye. Hey, buddy. Bye-bye, Matty. Matthew, can you say hello to Catherine? Hi. Hi. How do you two know each other? Howard is Matty's big brother. Mom said we can't have our playdate this week. Matthew. We talked about this. Oh, well, if you want a pizza and a DVD right here. I mean, just the big boys. - Thanks. - Huh? Howard, are you sure? Yeah, absolutely. Listen, just, uh, give me a text when you want me to come pick him up, and I will be there. And put your jacket on. Molbeck recovered remains of another Space Cowboy victim. You told him to search the sewers for Parker Fulton. That's where they found him. What was left. Parker Fulton was in a car accident in high school. He had his L4 and L5 vertebrae fused. They used a titanium plate and six screws. The serial number matches his medical records. The PSA guy said nothing heavier than water can get to that trap. There should be no metal in there. They were stumped. So, the Space Cowboy cut the Fulton kid up and floated the pieces through the sewers? Well, the induction pipes are designed to break up wood before it gets there, so... Styrofoam? It's synthetic. The solvents wouldn't be able to break it up. It would still be in that trap. He's dead. What's the difference? Hey. Yeah. So, just to clarify, this Joff Soika kid jumps, dies while on this unique, powerful form of Ecstasy, which leads us to the Space Cowboy, a genius Ecstasy producer who happens to be a frigging genius serial killer who travels to the same cities every 19 months, selling drugs and preying on young couples, the latest being Abbey and the late Parker Fulton. No. He's a serial killer who makes drugs. The killing is his thing. The drugs are just a means to finance it. You buried your mother this morning. You're emotionally compromised. Anyone would be. But there's no getting around it. Go home. No. That you're even here today tells me you're obsessed with this case. Suddenly obsessed is a problem? Obsessed doesn't have a family, doesn't have a social life. What it does is work 24/7 to close cases that gets their bosses promoted. You need me obsessed. You use me to make you look good. So why don't you just back off and let me do what I need to do? All right, you're right. I'm sorry. I'll go home. Can I come in tomorrow? Uh, Space Cowboy is a producer, not a dealer. Someone in this town deals his drugs. Find out who that is. Wilkie, you're on Schaeffer's security detail. Wait. The victims... are like objects to him. Toys... to be played with, broken, and thrown away at will. So my guess is, if Abbey Fulton is still alive... she won't be for very long. No...! Please let me go! No! - No! No! - Shh, shh, shh. I'm not blind. I can see that you're upset, and not without reason. Can I level with you, Abbey? It's not you. It's me. I am sorry, Abbey. But these things happen. My brother called. He works in the second district court. This is why I ducked out of the briefing. It's a restraining order on Jensen. Hasn't been filed yet. You did the right thing bringing this to me. I'll take care of it. You got currency with me, Jerry. And I'd like to cash it in. Don't go too hard on Jensen. You got currency bringing me dirt on Jensen, but you want to spend it on protecting her? Look, I didn't bring this in to hurt her. And I didn't do it for currency. - Why did you bring this? - So you can fix it. She's a gifted detective. You know... better than me. And I'm... man enough to admit it. That's all. - You want me to put you with someone else? - No, sir. I'm good with Jensen. Jerry. All my detectives have their gifts. You just demonstrated yours. Why, why... Why do I send you that? Thomas Schaeffer. I know you 'cause you wrote about me. Yeah, you wrote about me in your book. Oh. Hey. Hey, you. You smug, self-satisfied... Those who can, do... You know the rest. You... You think that you're serious. Oh. "Police and profiling expert..." You're an expert now? Expert. _ You think you know me? You don't know me. Hello? Wilkie? You have reached 5-5-0... You have reached the Schaeffers. Thomas? You in there? Uh, are you okay? I'm, uh... fine. Did Wilkie see you come in? I don't know. You wrote that serial killers... are most likely to kill again immediately following an emotional stressor. Anything that threatens their sense of control. Divorce, loss of a job, death in the family. Death of a spouse? There aren't rules that they follow, Catherine. It's a pattern that emerges if you study a large enough sample. I don't think today's the right day - for you to be doing this. - You also wrote... that serial killers and serial sex offenders - follow mostly the same patterns. - Yes, but I was describing a spectrum of behavior, not a one-to-one correlation. Just because your mom died doesn't mean that Howard's gonna rape a child. Do pedophiles react to stressors the same way serial killers do? Then I know who he's going after. I've seen him. And I'm gonna stop Howard before he does it to that kid. Okay, there's a resemblance to David. But it doesn't mean that he's gonna molest him. - You can't accept that I'm right. - No. You can't accept that there are no easy answers here. You don't have any answers at all! Maybe if you do, you don't trust me with them. No, that's not it. You stood there in that basement and you promised me you were gonna help me. Why haven't you? What if you are right but you can't prove it? I'm gonna catch him. Hey. I interviewed six of Soika's friends. None of them admits knowing who sold him the drugs. Harlan Rey. He's the promoter who threw the party where Soika died. We also think he supplied the drugs. - You think, or you know? - Got it off a reliable CI. But Rey's careful-- he's never been charged or arrested. The kind of dealer the Space Cowboy would use to limit his exposure. Isn't he? And based on Thomas's profile, if Rey is the one guy in town the Space Cowboy deals with, he'll keep an eye on him. We need to be discreet. Yeah, we also need him to cooperate without any leverage. Don't worry about the leverage. Bronte ID'd the dealer. Harlan Rey began promoting parties as a freshman at Pitt. Made so much money he dropped out, began doing it full-time. At some point, he began supplying the drugs - at his raves. - We have no way to compel Rey into giving up the Space Cowboy. If we bust him now, we scare the Cowboy into leaving town. I'll take care of it. How you gonna do that? I'll find Rey's lawyer, have the DA offer him blanket immunity on all drug charges to date. If he says no, Harlan Rey becomes the primary target of your Special Narcotics Unit. You okay with this? With what? Us. Working together. We had our thing and then we didn't talk. But work was never a problem for us. Schaeffer seems like a decent guy. Schaeffer? Sorry. It's none of my business. It's just hard not to notice the way you two interact. I thought maybe there was something between you. What, you think anytime I work with a guy, I have a thing with him? And is that what you think we were? That's him. - What are we doing? - Homicide. You need to spend more time in Narcotics. Teach you all the tricks. We got to be discreet. All we got to do is get him to give us his cell phone. We, uh, attach it to the cloner... bang out a copy of his SIM card. Then... pop it into one of these. Any text or call he gets... we get. Let me do it. Do what? Well, you said you guys do buy-busts here all the time, right? Yeah, that's why I picked the place. We don't anyone thinking he's meeting with the cops. It's a strip club; you're a woman. Give me your jacket. All right, tough guy. And the cloner. - If I'm not back in 15... - Mm. I'm meeting some people. You're meeting me. Act like we're old friends. Order us a couple beers, like you know what I drink. Two beers. My lawyer says you're offering a pretty unusual written immunity agreement. Says I should cooperate. Tell me about the Space Cowboy. Why you so interested? Joff Soika. His folks are rich. They know people. They want justice. You're not a big enough fish to satisfy them. Trust me, Harland, you're lucky they aren't interested. If they were, the only party you'd be promoting would be the one thrown in your ass up in Marienville. Thanks. If you had anything on me you wouldn't be offering a deal. The only reason we don't have anything is 'cause we haven't been looking. Until now, no one gave a shit about your cheap little happy pills. We just started giving a shit. He hit me up online eight years ago. Sent me a sample. It's the best stuff I ever saw. I don't know his name. Never seen his face. It's all done through text. Every 19 months, he asks what I want, texts back a price and GPS coords where to leave his cash. Different spots but always state parks. I leave the cash and a day later he texts me where to pick up my pills. Limited risk. Everyone's happy. Picked up my last buy last week. Where do you keep the cell you use? In my jacket pocket. I'm gonna reach into your pocket and I'm gonna clone your cell. Then I'm gonna get up and walk out of here. I want you to wait a few minutes, then text him. Tell him you want to make another buy. I do it, I get my deal? Yeah. And an offer of police protection until we pick him up. You should think about it. Just did. Paul Cavallo? Frank Bisgaard. Thanks for meeting me here. I, uh, I wanted to meet you off campus, to, uh, avoid any unnecessary focus that you have unwittingly brought upon yourself. Unwittingly? I'm commander of Homicide. Catherine works for me. Homicide? She's a detective? - I didn't know... - Well, you see, that, uh... that explains the restraining order. Let me be up front with you... Cheese Dad. Catherine is a great cop. This will end her career. I'll have to fire her. And that's when it becomes your problem. You're gonna piss her off. And a pissed off Catherine is a world of hurt no one wants to live in. And there's another thing-- cops tend to look at this sort of thing as an attack on all of them. And the last thing you need is for a whole shitload of cops to think that Paul Cavallo has a problem with the Pittsburgh PD. I just want her to stay away from me. Then we want the same thing, Paul. Yeah, uh... Dropped. Don? Don? Don't move! Whoa, whoa, whoa, it's me! Gun. On the floor. Now. Okay. What the hell is wrong with you? You want me to shoot you over a clogged toilet at 2:00 AM? - You didn't answer me. - I couldn't hear you. The hell? Where did you get this?! Hi, um, two for the 11:00? Okay. Uh, it's $20. There, enjoy. Hey. Uh, how long is the movie? Uh, one hour and 52 minutes. Thank you. I heard your car. I was worried about you. Alone, in this house. Good thing I went shopping. You hardly have any food in here. And when's the last time you went grocery shopping? Well, I have to admit, it's been awhile. Since my bachelor days. Well, I'm glad you're here. If I don't keep an eye on you, who will? I know we've had our differences through the years, but... thank you, pussycat. Why don't you go back to bed, hmm? I'll come check on you tomorrow. Yeah. Good night. It was fun. Yeah. It was fun. Second time. Excuse me? Excuse me, hello? - Yes? - Hi, um... I'm sorry to ask you, I... my wife is supposed to pick me up here, uh, somewhere. But I think I'm in the wrong place. Is this 14th and Reed? Oh... You're on 13th. Okay, well, fine. Uh, she'll probably be able to find me here. Thank you so much. Let's just take him. Excuse me? We can take you. What? Oh. Thank you. That's very kind of you. Uh, God bless you. Yeah. Thank you. - Uh, here you go. 14th and Reed. - Oh. - Oh, great, thank you. - Yeah. Is-is there a white SUV around? It's my wife's car. Yeah, it's over here. Here, come on. Just watch the... Okay. Here she is. I don't see anybody here. Hey. Hey... Wilkie may not look it, but he used to be SWAT. He did, he's a crack shot. And you're lucky he didn't kill you. Well, he's doesn't inspire much confidence as a bodyguard. You're also lucky he let me take over your protective detail and didn't arrest you. Felony possession of a sawed-off shotgun? It's a federal charge. And what's with the gun, Thomas? Benedicte asked me... "Why now?" Take a look at that date. January 5. The postmark on the Space Cowboy's postcards? January 6. This is why he sent the postcards? I came to you for help on Eric Krogh. - So it's my fault. - Yeah... everything's always your fault. You want to borrow my shotgun? You're a mean drunk. I'm not drunk. Ego. You think it's your fault, I think it's my fault. Ego controls us. What do you mean? Well, those postcards that he sent to me and to Burkhart in prison were his response to a challenge to his ego, an insult. Sending the postcards was the one thing that he did that was off his script. And he can't physically get to Burkhart. _ _ My brother's wife... asked me to get the shotgun out of the house. She was afraid. So I took it. Two weeks later, he beat her to death. He didn't need the gun. That's why you won't answer my questions about Howard. 'Cause you think I'm like you're brother. If you were the same as him, then Howard would've been dead years ago. The difference is we see violence and we can't sleep. But they sleep just fine. I killed Eric Krogh. Yeah. How'd you sleep? The morning after the Roman Numeral case, I had 49 messages from the media. I couldn't leave my house for four days. They lost interest that quickly? They found a better story. School shooting. I've never had a single piece written about me that didn't have the word "kill" in the title. You do study killers. Yeah, but why do they write about that stuff? I taught John to ride a bike that week. That didn't make the papers. Violence is addictive. Contagious. And we're social animals, so other people affect us. Especially family. My brother affects me. Your situation is even worse. Howard's still a part of your life. You need to be careful. Howard doesn't control me. _ There's nothing that will stop what is going to happen to you. Trust me. I've been doing this long before you got here. I'll be doing it long after. Narcotics. The suspect has provided four locations inside James Irwin State Park for our CI to leave cash payments. He's doing this as we speak. There are a dozen roads into this park. We don't know which he'll use. Stay on comms and report regularly. We're using TAC-COM-6. The suspect is armed and extremely dangerous. _ We're using as many bodies as we can without tipping our hand. It's not ideal. So use caution. Any questions? Let's get this son of a bitch. You all right? _ I got to go. - You're joking, right? - No. What are you talking about? We're on a stakeout. - This is the biggest case we ever had. - Do you remember when I told the suspect in the Angela Early case that my brother had been murdered? - Yeah. - The killer's about to do it again. But if I leave this minute, I can catch him. Please, just... I can't explain. Will you cover for me? Yeah. Go. Thank you. Have him back soon. Well... I've been looking forward to tonight for quite a while, Matty. Hey. What are you doing? It's okay. Pittsburgh Police. I was just thinking tonight I could teach you how to play a new game. You on the job? Yeah. Yeah, I need you to get that flashlight out of my eye, get in your truck, shut off your lights and get out of here now, okay? So, make yourself at home. I know a big boy game we can play. I hear you, Detective, but, uh, well, I just have to shoot you first. 38101, Code 3, officer down. Repeat, Code 3, officer down. The Space Cowboy just shot a Pittsburgh Detective. It's my fault. My friend was nearly killed, I wasn't thinking right and now I'm-- Catherine, you have not been thinking straight for a long time. He's doing it again. I need to help catch him. At what cost? I wouldn't be able to live with myself-- Too late for that. Catherine! Those Who Kill, season finale next Sunday at 10, on LMN.
