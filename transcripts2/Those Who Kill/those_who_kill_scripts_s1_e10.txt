 Previously on Those Who Kill... Catherine, there's been an accident. It was a stroke? I'm basing that on what your stepfather recounted to the EMTs. Tell David I love him. This Joff Soika kid dies while on this unique form of Ecstasy, which leads us to the Space Cowboy. He's a serial killer who makes drugs. The killing is his thing. Why would this Space Cowboy send a postcard to you?

 Ego. Amateurs don't sleep. Experts like him sleep just fine. You've insulted a prolific and proficient serial killer who knows where you live. We need to get you and your family out of that house. I'm working this case, Frank. I'm staying. Harland Rey began promoting parties at Pitt. Tell me about the Space Cowboy. I don't know his name. Never seen his face. I expect he'll probably send GPS coords where to leave his cash. Howard is Matty's big brother. Just because your mom died doesn't mean that Howard's gonna rape a child.

 I know a big boy game we can play. I'm gonna catch him. What if you are right but you can't prove it? - I got to go. - What are you talking about? We're on a stakeout. Do you remember when I told a suspect my brother had been murdered? The killer's about to do it again. - I can't explain. Will you cover for me? - Yeah. Go. - Thank you. - The suspect has provided four locations inside James Irwin State Park. The suspect is armed and extremely dangerous. So use caution. 38101, Code 3, officer down. Repeat, Code 3, officer down. Officer down! Hold on, Jerry. Stay with me. Intubated. BP 80/40. I'm here. Come on. We'll take him from here. Catherine, you okay? What happened? Car-- make, license? Did you get a shot off? This is the kind of shit you pray never happens. Hang in there. Jerry will pull through. Ali... they took him to surgery. Oh, my God, Catherine. He's gonna be all right. He has to be. Ali... let's go talk to the doctor. Go home. Come back when you get some rest. Sync and corrections by n17t01 www.addic7ed.com The Space Cowboy just shot a Pittsburgh detective. He knows every cop in Western Pennsylvania will be looking for him. We have to find Abbey Fulton before he takes her out of state. Expand the perimeters of our search. Include storage facilities and warehouses. Harland Rey, the dealer who gave us the Space Cowboy's drop point where Molbeck was shot, is missing. If the Cowboy knows we're onto him, he knows who put us there and he'll want payback on Rey. Put a BOLO out on Rey forthwith. We need to find out what went wrong at the drop point so we can find the Cowboy. I can't keep this in house and keep the Bureau out of it much longer. Missing Persons uncovered them this morning. Sarah Branson, Brad Wallace. Look familiar? Sarah Branson and Abbey Fulton certainly are his type. Mm-hmm. Put all available personnel on this new couple. Find Bronte. See if Narco has any available resources for us. And find Rey. You got it. Thomas? Take a walk, Smith. I gotta change. I'll keep watch. Catherine? What happened? How did Jerry get shot? Last night when we were waiting for the drop, I... I got word that Howard was... he was with the boy from my mother's funeral, Matthew Volper. Howard took him out for game night. He's doing it again, Thomas. How-- how could you possibly know that? I used a SIM card cloner on Howard's cell... so I could track him. No. Catherine, that's illegal. It's inadmissible. What he did to David... if it kept him from doing it to another boy... At what cost? This was it. This was the one chance to catch him in the act. The text was from the mother. "Matty's excited to play big boy games." What you did, the phone? Howard would walk. At the very least, you need to get the boy or his mother to say what happened. I can't. Not now. Not after what happened to Jerry. I'm responsible. Okay, I will check up on that boy. At least see that he's okay. So, "Steelers play the AFC South this year. Texans, Titans. That's going to be easier and put less pressure on a rebuilding here. Of course, Steelers won't call it 'rebuilding.'" I have no idea what I just said, but I know you do. Don't worry, Jerry. I'll make this right. Huh? What? What was that? Speak up. Come on. You had no trouble talking to the police. But to me... your friend... what, nothing? Oh, Harland, what's the matter? Cat got your tongue? Oh, wait. No, I do. It's my fault. Molbeck. I left. He said I could to investigate, but I shouldn't have. Wait a minute. You were gone? How long did you think it would be before we figured this out? I'm not trying to pull anything or protect myself from any sort of punishment, but I-- my partner, my friend was nearly killed. I wasn't thinking right, and now I'm coming clean. Catherine, you haven't been thinking straight for a long time. You shot Krogh, you left Molbeck, there was a-a restraining order that was almost filed against you. - What? - I backed him down. I don't know what you're talking about. Paul Cavallo! You need help, Catherine. This shooting, your mother's passing, this affair. I think the best thing would be for you to take a leave of absence. I can't do that. You had such a good thing here. I hope whatever it is is worth you blowing all of it. I take full responsibility for my actions. It's too late for that. You don't live in a bubble. There's fallout! Your promotion-- are they asking questions? A detective was shot. What do you think? Maybe if we... catch the Cowboy and bring the two hostages back safe... Look, let me stay while I get the help that I need. I hear you and I don't disagree, Commander. But I need to help catch him. I need to be a part of that, or I won't be able to live with myself. For what happened to Molbeck... After we get him, you can hold me accountable for everything. Is this just another lie so I won't remove you from duty? No, you know it's not, sir. No, I don't. We found Rey. It's bad. I'm gonna check the other rooms. You know when, uh, Rey checked in? Front desk said two nights ago. Same night he contacted the Space Cowboy about the second MDMA buy. Was that before or after he refused protective custody? Dismemberment is consistent with his previous male victims. Yeah, except for one thing. Rey's tongue is missing. Butchering is motivation to get Rey to talk, but the tongue... punishment for ratting him out. My guess is that every time he asked Rey a question... He cut something off. Very thorough interrogation. Find something? Walls are thin. Maybe someone heard something. Gonna check with the front desk. Hey. I know you've been through hell the last couple of weeks. You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Mmm. You sure? You know, when I was with you... that's the... the last time I felt safe. I thought of you. Oh, I thought of you... Mmm. When you walked into Narcotics, I let myself think we might... What? Nico. I was there, Catherine. At the equipment room. When you returned the SIM cloner. I know you cloned Howard's cell. That's gonna stay between us. But every case that used that device could be screwed because of it. Benson? Bronte? Where'd you guys go? Wait. When I walked into Narcotics... Hmm? ...you let yourself think what? That something would be different. That maybe we could work out. But you're still chasing ghosts. All right, that's it, guys! Good practice! Don't leave anything in the bleachers! You want to stay, Matt? - Hit a few? - Sure, Howie. Remember, balance your... Keep your knees bent like that. Keep it in there. Okay, ready? Ha! - Give me the tent. - Okay. Give me the tent. Okay, now. Oh, good one, good one! Way to go, Matty! Excuse me. Were you at Marie Burgess' funeral? Yes. I thought I recognized you. I'm-I'm Thomas Schaeffer. I'm a friend of Catherine's, Howard's stepdaughter. Oh, yes. Lovely girl. Marie's passing... What a blow. Such a perfect family. Come on, wake up now! Watch your post! Is that, uh... is that your son - out there on the ice? - Yeah, that's Matty. Right there. Yah! Another! Good! Stick save and a beauty! Good one. Get back! You know what, I was gonna go grab him some hot chocolate... Oh. I could walk with you. All right. Good. So, did you meet Howard through the training program? No, we went through family court. Matty's daddy basically fell off the face of the earth and Howard stepped in. He's been really good to us. Does he give a lot of extra time to Matty? If I get stuck at work, he'll babysit for me. You know, um, has him over for pizzas and game nights. I guess that's gonna be harder with Marie being gone. Well, it was always mostly Howard. Marie... I think she worried that it put too much on his plate. You know, um... You want one? Being a big brother, or father, or whatever to Matty. Really? How do you mean? Sometimes she would try to say that he was too tired, or she'd want to be there to help, but Howard really understands how important it is to be a mentor to a little boy like Matty. He really needs a father figure. I think he was kind of disappointed that she wasn't more encouraging, you know, of the time he spent coaching the boys or with Matty. Anyway, it was really nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, too. Let's go, Pens. Hi, yeah. I'm looking to get a-a copy or a transcript of a 911 call. There's no way to hear it? Right, that sounds speedy. Okay, thank you. Well, I can't help feeling sorry for Rey. We kept him in the dark. He thought we were only going after the Space Cowboy for drug manufacturing, not hunting and slaughtering. Kid never stood a chance. Look, if the Cowboy was gonna leave town, then there would be no reason to torture Rey. He'd just disappear. I think he wants to stay. He wants to finish as planned. So you believe he's still gonna stick to his MO? Nothing this guy does is arbitrary. - He's not impulsive. - He shot a cop. Look, that wasn't part of his plan. He's gonna leave town, if he hasn't already. What does all this mean about Sarah Branson and Brad Wallace? I think you may still have some time. He's a serial monogamist. So he'll need to dispose of the previous conquest before he turns his attention to the new couple. If you were right about the only victim of the Cowboy's who's ever been found, one that you mistakenly attributed to Robert Burkhart in your book... Caroline Henson. Won't he also bury Abbey somewhere he can revisit? Henson was dug up by animals in a state park, right? That's where his drug drop sites are and where he shot Jerry. It's got to be a park site. All right. Let's establish stop-search checkpoints and the entrances of every state park in the Pittsburgh area. We've got to sell it like it's a legitimate sobriety check. He attempts to make a drop, that's it. We take him. Breaker, breaker, this is Lone Wolf. Brake check outside McConnell's Mill. Hey there, Lone Wolf. Just passed through 20 minutes back. Sobriety check. Place is crawling with Bears. They're hiding all over the road. If you're past the rest stop, you're screwed. They're everywhere.♪ ♪ Hello, Officer. License and registration. Two years sober myself. Appreciate you keeping the idiots off the road. Is that right? Mind if I check in the back? Thank you. Enjoy the park. Thank you. If you have to go that bad, I'll set you up with a bush. All right, come on. Let's go. We'll find someplace no one will see you. You know, I told you we should have stopped before we got here. It'll be all right. Come on. Look, behind these tubs. Yeah. I'll even hold this up for you. Time for us to see other people. Oh, no! Hey, uh, the 911 call that Howard made the night that your mother fell, that's not for public record, but you could request it as part of a police investigation. Can you do that? Uh, yeah. Why? Look, I did go and check up on Matthew Volper and I spoke to his mother. She told me that Marie had been discouraging of Howard spending time with Matthew. It's-- it's probably nothing. It's probably just in my head, but... I gotta take this other call. I'll call you back. B, how are you? I'm returning your call. How's John? He wants to know when we can come home. Can I talk to him? He's up in his room playing. I miss you. I've been missing you a long time. Are you still there? Yeah, Dad just got home with the groceries. I have to... Of course. Look, I-I'll call back this evening, okay? Sure. No! No, no, no, no, no! Go, go, go! Get in! Get in! Hurry! Come on! Hurry! Got it, got it, got it! Come on! Let's go! Let's go! Copper wire was run from the transaxle to the gas line. Thing was rigged to blow. Still, there's no solid evidence that it's his SUV. I don't need solid evidence. I know it was him. Our contact with Harland Rey, the roadblock. He's not rattled. He's improvising, which means everything that we thought we knew... Look, he must've known that the roadblock was a fabrication, so he dumped Abbey Fulton's body in the bushes to avoid capture. Disposed of Sarah and Brad's body and, at the same time, destroyed the car he used to transport Abbey Fulton's body. He's changing his methods. But he's as meticulous as ever. He knows we're watching. He's skipping town. If he hasn't already. What? FBI. - Deputy Chief. - Frank. With the Molbeck shooting, there was no way to keep the FBI from finding out about your Space Cowboy case. What the hell were you thinking, Frank? You should've turned it over the second it went from a routine drug bust to a potential serial killer. It's theirs now. Special Agent Hoff is in charge. Effective immediately. Well, let's get it over with, then. I'm sorry, Frank. I was sent here to inform you, you're being passed over for Assistant Chief. In the last couple of days, aside from one of our own being in ICU, we found a body in a lot, two 20-somethings burned in an exploded truck, and a drug-dealing kid chopped in pieces. Eight years, 19 couples abducted without raising any suspicion. He's flown under the radar long enough. The Cowboy's fled your jurisdiction. It's time we go public. I'm calling a press conference, and I'm issuing a general warning to the public and I'm gonna make a plea for any possible witnesses. - No, if you go wide with this, he'll... - Oh, he'll what? Run? Your division's already taken care of that, Detective. I got an idea. We have to get to him first. It all comes back to his bruised ego. This guy is all over himself. He'll subscribe to Google Alerts-- MDMA, the names of the victims. Any of them come up online... He's alerted. He'll know. Now, if you put out that the profiler who's been working with the Pittsburgh Bureau believes that this guy is... nothing more than a... a cheap disciple-- no, better yet, a copycat-- of convicted serial killer Robert Burkhart, I think he'll show his hand. Hey, Frank, do you have a mi-- _ Hey, uh, it's me. I was just calling to see if I can catch John before he goes to sleep. If you get this, give me a call. Bye. Get on your face! I want Schaeffer. Drop it. Do it. You'll sleep just fine. Thomas. Don't be worse than them. Do you know where you are? You get him? Got him, Jerry. Got him for you. Mm. Hey. - Thanks for your help. - Yeah. Here. Remember that honorary Narcotics hat? The badge thing-- I designed it. Pretty cool, huh? That hat... you'll always have a place to hang it. Thanks. Take care of yourself, Catherine. I owe you one. Look, about what happened at the house. Um... Oh. Uh, it's Benedicte. - I got to... just... - Sure. Don't go anywhere. _ B... He's in custody. Oh, thank God. I'm so sorry, B. I just want for you and John and me to be a family again. Is he there? Can I talk to him? No, Thomas, it's late. John's already in bed. Of course. I need to know that it's over. He's in custody, it's over. Not him. This. You working with the police. It ends tonight. 911. What is your emergency? It's my wife Marie, she's not... She fell. Where are you, sir? Uh... Uh, 466, uh, Oakdale Lane. She's... she's not responding. There's-- there's blood. What is your name? Howard, uh, Howard Burgess. I'm her husband. Okay, Howard, EMTs are on the way. Is Marie breathing? I... I-I don't know, I can't tell. I think so. She was going upstairs... to bed. When she got to the top, she, uh... she froze, and the next thing I know, she was at the bottom and she started convulsing and then... She... she's bleeding. Have you attempted any form of resuscitation? Howie, what's happening? Is that your son? Is he all right? Look, go back... to the room. Marie's hurt, I... Stay where I told you! Uh, no, my-my wife and I are babysitting... I don't want them to see. Howard, how long has Marie been unconscious? I don't know. I don't know. Howard, how long has Marie been unconscious? Matthew, just go back down to the playroom. She caught you. Mom caught you and you killed her. The drive should take four hours. Anyone seen Catherine? She just ran out the door. Howard, how long has Marie been unconscious? Matthew, just go back down to the playroom. Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me, excuse me! That's the one I'm looking for. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Catherine!
