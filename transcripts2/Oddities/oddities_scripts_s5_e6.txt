COLLECTING AND DEALING... HUNTING AND PICKING... TO GET THIS BUSINESS... DOWN TO A SCIENCE. THIS IS "ODDITIES." HEY, WHAT'S UP, DUDE? HEY, BROTHER. WHAT'S GOING ON, MAN? WHAT'S HAPPENING, MAN? GOOD TO SEE YOU. GOOD TO SEE YOU, TOO. WHAT BRINGS YOU TO MY NECK OF THE WOODS?

 I GOT SOMETHING CRAZY I WANT YOU TO SEE. OKAY. WHAT IS IT? I DON'T EVEN KNOW. I WAS IN MY HOMETOWN OF ST. LOUIS RECENTLY. THIS GUY HAD A CRAZY MEDICAL COLLECTION. THERE WAS A LOT OF CRAZY STUFF IN JARS, YOU KNOW, STUFF THAT I SEE AT YOUR PLACE ALL THE TIME... TEETH, SKULLS, AND ARMS AND WEIRD APPENDAGES. AND SO I PICKED UP ONE PIECE THAT REALLY KIND OF STRUCK MY CURIOSITY. SOME FOLKS CALL ME "DADDY LONG LEGS." I'M A ROCK 'N' ROLL OUTLAW. I KNOW RYAN. WE'VE BEEN FRIENDS FOR A LONG TIME. WE USED TO PLAY IN ROCK 'N' ROLL BANDS TOGETHER. I CAME ACROSS THIS ONE PIECE, AND I THOUGHT IF ANYBODY COULD TELL ME ANYTHING ABOUT IT, IT'D BE HIM. LET'S SEE IT, MAN. HERE SHE IS. WOW. WHAT THE HECK IS THAT THING? I DON'T KNOW. CAN I CHECK IT OUT REAL QUICK? ABSOLUTELY. I THOUGHT OF MY GIRLFRIEND, 'CAUSE IT REMINDED ME OF A FLOWER. I WAS LIKE, "I WANT TO GET HER A PRESENT WHILE I'M OUT OF TOWN." SO I BROUGHT THIS THING BACK. AND SHE WAS TERRIFIED OF IT. SHE ABSOLUTELY HATED THE THING. SO I THOUGHT I SHOULD JUST BRING IT DOWN TO YOU AND SEE IF YOU COULD TELL ME ANYTHING ABOUT IT OR IF YOU'D BE INTERESTED IN IT. I MEAN, THIS IS MOST CERTAINLY MEDICAL. THIS ONE IS SEALED UP, WHICH IS FUNNY, BECAUSE THIS IS SOME KIND OF HUMAN, DRY SPECIMEN. DID THEY GIVE YOU ANY KIND OF INFORMATION ALONG WITH IT, OR... THEY HAD NOTHING TO TELL ME. NOTHING AT ALL? YEAH. IT LOOKS AS THOUGH IT'S BEEN DISSECTED. RIGHT. YEAH. THIS ALMOST LOOKS LIKE A BILE DUCT, AND THEN IT'S GOT ANOTHER LITTLE BRANCH COMING OFF THE SIDE OF IT. THERE'S SEVERAL DIFFERENT ORGANS THAT COULD HAVE THAT. I HAVE TO ADMIT, I'M KIND OF STUMPED AS TO WHAT EXACTLY IT IS. I MEAN, IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS, I COULD JUST SPLIT, YOU KNOW? OH, NO, NO, NO. I'M DEFINITELY INTERESTED IN IT. IT CLEARLY LOOKS MEDICAL. IT'S COOL, BUT IF I KNEW WHAT THIS ACTUAL PIECE WAS, I COULD GIVE YOU A BETTER GUESS AS TO WHAT IT MIGHT BE WORTH. IT COULD BE WORTH A LOT. RIGHT ON. IF YOU HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME, I HAVE A FRIEND WHO DEALS IN PATHOLOGY. WE COULD SHOW IT TO HER, SEE WHAT SHE SAYS ABOUT IT, AND THEN MAYBE I CAN MAKE AN OFFER TO YOU. ABSOLUTELY. LET'S CHECK IT OUT. LET'S DO IT. ALL RIGHT, MAN. HEY, GUYS. HOW'S IT GOING. HOW ARE YOU? IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. YEAH, GOOD TO SEE YOU, TOO. BEEN A WHILE. HOW HAVE YOU BEEN? HOW ARE YOU? GREAT. HOW IS THE DENTAL PHANTOM TREATING YOU? THE DENTAL PHANTOM'S GREAT... A WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL PIECE. I'M SO GLAD YOU GOT IT FOR ME. OH, THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR. SO, WHAT BRINGS YOU IN TODAY? I'M HERE FOR A FEW REASONS, ACTUALLY. BUT FIRST, I REALLY WANT TO SHOW YOU THIS. WOW. OH, COOL. WHAT IS THAT? YEAH, WHAT IS IT? IT'S A NICE, LITTLE TOY HERE. OH. THAT'S THE GIVEAWAY. YEAH, A LITTLE GIVEAWAY THERE. YEAH, THAT PROBE RIGHT THERE, RIGHT? THIS IS A BEAUTY. IT'S AN ENEMA MACHINE. I'VE BEEN SHOPPING AT OBSCURA FOR A FEW YEARS NOW. I REALLY LOVE TORTURE-CHAMBER-LIKE ITEMS, OLD SURGICAL AND MEDICAL EQUIPMENT... ANYTHING THAT'S TABOO AND NASTY AND GRISLY. IT KIND OF LOOKS LIKE A BICYCLE-PUMP... STYLE OF ENEMA. AND, OF COURSE, THIS WOULD BE A SELF-ADMINISTERED ENEMA. RIGHT. WELL, THIS ONE, IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S LONG ENOUGH. I GUESS YOU'D DEPLOY IT AND SIT UPON IT AND PUMP AWAY AND... UH, YEAH, PUMP AWAY, SURE. AND LET THE FUN BEGIN. AND, YEAH, THEY WOULD HAVE FILLED THIS WITH MEDICATION OR EVEN JUST SOAP. WELL, THIS IS CLEARLY A RICH PERSON'S ENEMA. SURE. IT'S AN ELITE ENEMA. YEAH, THIS IS SOMEONE WITH SOME MONEY AND, YOU KNOW, UH... RECTAL PROBLEMS. RIGHT. I MEAN, I AM LOOKING TO SELL IT. OH! OH, OKAY. THIS IS A GORGEOUS ENEMA. I MEAN, WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO PART WITH IT? WELL, WE JUST MOVED TO SALEM. MASSACHUSETTS? OH. YEAH, SALEM, MASSACHUSETTS. CONGRATULATIONS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WE'RE LIVING IN AN OLD JAIL OVER THERE. THAT'S PRETTY COOL. VERY HISTORIC PLACE. THEY HANGED OVER 221 PEOPLE THERE. OH, LOVELY. THAT'S PERFECT FOR YOU. THE THING IS, IS THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOME INTERESTING ITEMS MAYBE TO FIT, YOU KNOW, THE WHOLE FEEL. RIGHT, SO YOU'RE NOT GOING WITH AN ENEMA MOTIF SO MUCH. NO, BECAUSE AS MUCH AS I LOVE THE AESTHETIC, IT'S NOT WHAT I'M FOND OF. PRISON... PRISON, SHACKLES, TORTURE, SPIKY. PUNISHMENT. YEAH. PUNISHMENT. SURE. YEAH. ANYTHING THAT WOULD BE UNCOMFORTABLE AND TERRIBLE. VERY HOMEY. YEAH, DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING IN THE STORE RIGHT NOW, OR...? WELL, NOT MUCH IN THE SHOP NOW. HOWEVER, WE'RE GONNA ACTUALLY GO TO THIS REALLY BIG ANTIQUE FLEA MARKET, BRIMFIELD MASSACHUSETTS. SO WE'LL KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR YOU, MAYBE DO, LIKE, A TRADE OR SOMETHING. YEAH. SURE. YEAH, THAT WOULD BE EXCELLENT. BEST WE COULD PROBABLY DO IS AROUND, MAYBE, $700 ON THIS THING, IF THAT WORKS WITH YOUR BUDGET. YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT PROBABLY SEEMS GOOD. I MEAN, WE NEED NEW STUFF FOR THE PLACE, AND WE COULD PROBABLY DO ABOUT $3,000. WELL, WE SHOULD DEFINITELY BE ABLE TO FIND YOU SOMETHING AT THAT PRICE... FIND YOU A FEW ITEMS. I'LL STOP BY. I'D LOVE TO SEE THE PLACE. IT SOUNDS AMAZING. WE LOVE OLD JAILS. SURE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MAN. THANKS, MIKE. THANKS, GUYS. TAKE CARE. SEE YOU THEN. WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THESE? WELL... THEY WERE ACTUALLY USED TO BEHEAD PEOPLE. REALLY? DADDY LONG LEGS BROUGHT IN THIS REALLY COOL SPECIMEN. I COULDN'T QUITE FIGURE OUT WHAT IT WAS. I THINK THE SPECIMEN GOES THIS WAY. THIS IS "ODDITIES." EVERY YEAR, WE GO TO A BIG FLEA MARKET IN BRIMFIELD, MASSACHUSETTS, TO FIND COOL STUFF FOR THE SHOP. THIS TIME, WE HAVE A CUSTOMER WHO'S LIVING IN A CONVERTED JAIL IN SALEM, MASSACHUSETTS, AND HE'S LOOKING FOR ANYTHING TO DO WITH IMPRISONMENT, TORTURE, AND EXECUTION. HOW'S IT GOING? HOW YOU DOING? I SAW THE SKULL AND CROSSBONES. YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE A BUG LIGHT TO US. JUST HAD TO STOP. THE REASON WHY WE'RE HERE IS, WE HAVE A CUSTOMER THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR ITEMS FOR. HE MOVED INTO A PLACE THAT USED TO BE A PRISON. AND HE'S KIND OF LOOKING FOR PRISON, TORTURE KIND OF ITEMS. I'VE BEEN DEALING IN ANTIQUES FOR 15 YEARS. BRIMFIELD, TO ME, IS THE BEST OF ANY SHOW. I THINK THERE'S JUST A TREMENDOUS VARIETY OF STUFF HERE. YOU CAN FIND THAT SORT OF AMAZING THING IN A PILE OF CRAP, YOU KNOW? I DO HAVE THESE SPEARS. THEY'RE FROM THE PHILIPPINES, AND THEY WERE FROM THE IGURAT WARRIORS, WHO WERE HEADHUNTERS. THESE WOULD NOT BE THE ACTUAL EXECUTION, THOUGH. THESE WERE USED TO WOUND THE VICTIM. AND THEN THE VICTIM WAS ULTIMATELY, UH, BEHEADED WITH AN AXE. THE SPLAYED PART HERE IS BASICALLY A FISHHOOK. ONCE THAT GOES IN, IT WON'T COME OUT. IT WILL STICK AND NOT ENABLE THE SPEAR TO BE PULLED OUT OF A WOUND. EXACTLY. I'M LIKING THESE. THESE COULD WORK, ESPECIALLY IN CONJUNCTION WITH SOMETHING LIKE THIS. WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THESE? WELL, THESE ARE EXECUTIONER SWORDS. WOW. Wow. THERE ARE TWO OF THEM. THEY'RE BOTH FROM THE BELGIAN CONGO. THEY BOTH DATE TO, LIKE, 1900, ROUGHLY. AND THEY WERE NGULU SWORDS THAT ARE FROM THE NGAMBE PEOPLE, AND THEY WERE ACTUALLY USED TO BEHEAD PEOPLE. REALLY? CAN WE TAKE A LOOK AT THAT? ABSOLUTELY. THIS ACTUALLY LOOKS A LITTLE DENTED HERE, LIKE IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN USED. MAYBE IT HIT A LITTLE SPINE MATERIAL. AND THE NEAT THING IS, YOU KNOW, WITH THE SHAPE HERE, I MEAN, THAT KIND OF CORRESPONDS TO THE BACK OF YOUR NECK, SO AS IT GOES THROUGH... THIS WOULD BE THE BACK END... IT JUST CUTS ALL THE WAY THROUGH. RIGHT. EXACTLY AS IT WOULD... ALTHOUGH, IT'S SO HARD TO CUT OFF A HUMAN HEAD. THE ANCIENT TRADITIONS OF THE NGAMBE AND SEVERAL OTHER CENTRAL-AFRICAN TRIBES ARE SLOWLY DYING OUT OVER TIME. FOR INSTANCE, THEY BELIEVE THAT THE HEAD CAN REMAIN AWARE OF ITS SURROUNDINGS FOR A FEW MINUTES AFTER DEATH. SO BEFORE SLICING, THEY STRAP THE HEAD OF THE VICTIM TO A TIGHTLY BENT TREE, CATAPULTING THE SEVERED HEAD THROUGH THE JUNGLE, AND GIVING IT THE ILLUSION OF TRAVELING TOWARD HEAVEN. EVEN THOUGH THESE ARE ETHNOGRAPHIC ITEMS... THESE ARE FROM THE PHILIPPINES, AND THOSE ARE FROM AFRICA, YOU SAID... I THINK IT MIGHT ACTUALLY WORK WITH WHAT OUR CUSTOMER IS DOING. WHAT ARE YOU ASKING ON THESE? THESE... I AM LOOKING TO GET LIKE $450 RANGE. EACH? EACH. YEP. HMM. COULD YOU DO A PACKAGE PRICE FOR THE SPEAR AND ONE OF THE BEHEADING? OH... I COULD DO $700, WOULD BE THE BEST FOR ONE SPEAR AND ONE SWORD. I THINK SO. ALL RIGHT. GOT A DEAL THEN. GOOD, GOOD, GOOD. EXCELLENT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. ABSOLUTELY. ABSOLUTELY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. A BUDDY OF MINE CAME INTO THE SHOP WITH A MEDICAL SPECIMEN THAT HAS ME ABSOLUTELY STUMPED AS TO WHAT IT MIGHT BE. SO WE'RE PAYING A VISIT TO A PATHOLOGIST. SHE DEALS WITH DISEASES AND WHAT CAUSES THEM. AND SHE'S ACTUALLY DETERMINED A LOT OF SPECIMENS FOR ME IN THE PAST. - NICOLE? - HEY, WHAT'S UP? HOW ARE YOU? GOOD. HOW ARE YOU? GOOD. THIS IS MY BUDDY DADDY LONG LEGS. HEY, DADDY LONG LEGS. WHAT'S UP? HOW ARE YOU? DADDY LONG LEGS BROUGHT IN THIS REALLY COOL SPECIMEN. HE SAID THAT IT CAME OUT OF THIS MEDICAL COLLECTION IN ST. LOUIS. OKAY. I THINK THAT IT MIGHT BE HUMAN. I'M NOT TOTALLY SURE. SO I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU COULD LOOK AT IT, SINCE YOU DEAL WITH PATHOLOGY ALL THE TIME. ALL RIGHT. LET ME TAKE A LOOK AT THIS THING. YEAH. I LOOKED AT IT FOR A LITTLE WHILE. I COULDN'T QUITE FIGURE OUT WHAT IT WAS. I DEFINITELY THINK THAT IT IS HUMAN IN ORIGIN. I THINK THE SPECIMEN ACTUALLY GOES THIS WAY. HUH. I THOUGHT THE OTHER WAY, ACTUALLY. NO. I AM A PATHOLOGIST ASSISTANT. I PRIMARILY AM INTERESTED IN DEFORMED ORGANS WITH CANCER, INFECTIONS, OSTEOPOROSIS, AND ANYTHING THAT IS NOT GOOD. I THINK THAT THIS IS PROBABLY THE PROXIMAL PORTION OF THE STOMACH. IT'S SMALL, THOUGH. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHY IT MIGHT BE SMALL? WOW! MY GOODNESS. JUST LIKE LIVING IN PRISON, WHICH EVERYONE WANTS TO BE. THE NEXT THING WE GOT, THAT'S THE THING THAT FITS RIGHT HERE. OH, BOY. THIS IS "ODDITIES." DADDY LONG LEGS BROUGHT IN THIS REALLY COOL SPECIMEN. OKAY. I THINK THAT IT MIGHT BE HUMAN. LET ME TAKE A LOOK AT THIS THING. DEFINITELY HUMAN IN ORIGIN. I THINK THAT THIS IS PROBABLY THE PROXIMAL PORTION OF THE STOMACH. IT'S SMALL, THOUGH. THIS PREPARATION IS ACTUALLY FROM AN AUTOPSY SPECIMEN OF A BABY. WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT HERE IS THE TRACHEA AND A PART OF THE BRONCHIAL TREE, WHICH IS COMING OFF OF THE TRACHEA. AND WHAT I ACTUALLY THINK IS GOING ON HERE IS ESOPHAGEAL ATRESIA. ESOPHAGEAL ATRESIA JUST MEANS THAT THERE IS SOME PORTION OF THE ESOPHAGUS THAT DIDN'T FORM DURING CHILD BIRTH. OKAY. IN A NORMAL FETUS, FOOD GOES INTO THE STOMACH, AND AIR GOES INTO THE LUNGS. BUT IN THIS CASE, THE AIR IS ACTUALLY ABLE TO GO INTO THE STOMACH, AND THEN THE FOOD IS ACTUALLY ABLE TO GO INTO THE TRACHEA, WHICH IS... BAD. SO, BASICALLY, THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON HERE. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT SOMEONE CAREFULLY DISSECTED OUT AT AUTOPSY, AND THEN THEY MOUNTED IT TO SHOW THE ANOMALY. I THINK IT'S PRETTY RARE. SO I'M DEFINITELY INTERESTED IN IT. OKAY, COOL. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT, MAYBE, 100 BUCKS? UM... HMM. CAN YOU DO A LITTLE BETTER? SHE SAID IT WAS RARE, YOU KNOW? WHAT DO YOU THINK... LIKE $125? GOOD ENOUGH. YEAH? YEAH, MAN. ABSOLUTELY. ALL RIGHT, BROTHER. ALL RIGHT. GOOD TO SEE YOU, NICOLE. BYE. WE'RE AT BRIMFIELD FLEA MARKET LOOKING FOR A FEW ITEMS TO ACCESSORIZE A CLIENT'S PRISON-TURNED-APARTMENT IN SALEM, MASSACHUSETTS. WHAT DO WE GOT? MEMORY JUGS. THEY STILL HAVE THE SPIRIT OF THE DECEASED IN THEM. AH. WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING MORE SCIENTIFIC. THIS CAME OUT OF THE LOUISIANA STATE PRISON SYSTEM... FIVE SHIVS AND TWO ZIP GUNS. NOT QUITE OLD ENOUGH FOR WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR. WE FOUND SOME COOL ITEMS FOR THE SHOP, BUT WE STILL NEED TO FIND THAT ONE AMAZING PIECE FOR OUR CUSTOMER WITH AN EYE FOR TORTURE. - HEY. - HEY, HOW YOU DOING? HOW YOU DOING? HOW'S EVERYTHING? GOOD, GOOD. ACTUALLY, WE HAVE A CUSTOMER THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR AN ITEM FOR. HE MOVED INTO A NEW APARTMENT, WHICH IS ACTUALLY A FORMER PRISON. IT'S SORT OF MODERNIZED NOW, BUT HE WANTS TO KIND OF RECAPTURE THAT PRISON FEEL TO IT. RIGHT. YEAH. SOMETHING COZY... CORPORAL PUNISHMENT, EARLY FORMS OF TORTURE, THAT SORT OF... OKAY. WELL, YOU'RE IN LUCK, BECAUSE I JUST BOUGHT A COLLECTION OF ARMS AND ARMOR. AND IN THE COLLECTION, THERE WERE A FEW TORTURE PIECES. OH, OKAY. I HAVE THIS PIECE HERE. IT'S A SCOLD'S BRIDLE, OR BRANKS. OH, YEAH, YEAH. THIS WOULD ACTUALLY BE USED ON WOMEN WHO WERE CONSIDERED "LOOSE-TONGUED," AS THEY USED TO SAY. THE SCOLD'S BRIDLE IS A MEDIEVAL TORTURE DEVICE THAT'S BASICALLY A HUMAN MUZZLE. IT WAS USED ON WOMEN WHO WERE THOUGHT TO BE WITCHES OR SHREWS. THESE BRIDLES, OR BRANKS, OFTEN HAD A SPIKED MOUTHPIECE THAT FITTED RIGHT OVER THE TONGUE. AND IN ADDITION TO CAUSING GREAT PAIN, THEY PREVENTED SPEECH. THIS WAS CLEARLY MADE FAIRLY RECENTLY. I MEAN, THESE AREN'T EVEN SHARP. THAT'S KIND OF THE THING WE'RE LOOKING FOR, ALTHOUGH HE REALLY WANTS SOMETHING AUTHENTIC. IF HE'S A SERIOUS CUSTOMER, I HAVE A PIECE OVER HERE. YOU WON'T FIND ANOTHER ONE. OH. OH, THOSE ARE BEAUTIFUL. THAT IS NICE. YEAH. DON'T THEY CALL IT A PILLORY? CORRECT. THAT KIND OF WORKS PERFECT FOR AN OLD PRISON. YOU STICK YOUR HEAD THROUGH THERE. YOU PUT YOUR HANDS THROUGH HERE, WHICH ARE THEN HANDCUFFED. THAT IS... YOU WANT TO TRY THAT? NO. GO AHEAD. YOU CAN TRY IT. YOU HAVE BIG HANDS. I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'LL GET THROUGH THERE. BETTER YOU THAN ME. THIS TORTURE DEVICE WAS ACTUALLY WIDELY USED IN ENGLAND FROM ABOUT THE 14th CENTURY TO ABOUT THE MID-19th CENTURY. THEY PROBABLY DID VERY LITTLE TO REHABILITATE PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, BEING LOCKED IN THIS THING. ACTUALLY NOWADAYS, THEY KNOW THAT THIS SORT OF PUBLIC HUMILIATION LEADS TO PARANOIA, THOUGHTS OF REVENGE. YEAH, THIS IS NUTS. NOT A GOOD IDEA. FEEL LIKE, YOU KNOW, "AAH! HELP!" LOOK AT THAT! THAT'S EXACTLY HOW THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO WORK. AS YOU WALK THROUGH TOWN, THEY THROW TOMATOES AT YOU. YOU WERE KIND OF HELPLESS WHEN YOU WERE IN THIS, AND THEY WOULD... KICK YOU. YEAH. LET ME GET OUT OF THIS THING, GUYS. YEAH, I THINK I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THE... I'M INNOCENT, I SWEAR. WHAT WOULD YOU NEED ON THIS PIECE? I THINK THIS IS KIND OF JUST WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR. THIS IS PERFECT. I MEAN, I WOULD VALUE IT AT $3,000. I... YEAH. PROBLEM IS, WE'RE KIND OF CLOSER TO HIS BUDGET THAN WE'D LIKE TO BE. IF WE COULD GO TO LIKE... $2,500? ALL RIGHT, MAKE IT $2,500, BECAUSE I BOUGHT IT WITH A GROUP OF THINGS, AND IT WORKS FOR ME. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THIS IS PERFECT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU'RE WELCOME. GREAT. LET'S FIGURE OUT HOW TO WRAP THAT UP. OKAY. THIS IS "ODDITIES." A LONGTIME CUSTOMER, CHRIS, CAME INTO THE SHOP LOOKING FOR SOME PRISON-THEMED ITEMS FOR HIS APARTMENT. WE COMBED BRIMFIELD FLEA MARKET, AND NOW THAT WE FOUND THESE AWESOME TORTURE AND EXECUTION DEVICES, WE'RE GONNA DELIVER THEM TO CHRIS AT HIS JAILHOUSE APARTMENT IN SALEM. WE WENT A LITTLE OVER HIS BUDGET, SO I SURE HOPE HE LIKES WHAT WE GOT HIM. SALEM IS A REALLY UNIQUE PLACE. OF COURSE, IT'S THE LOCATION OF THE NOTORIOUS WITCH TRIALS OF THE 1690s. THERE ARE MANY THEORIES ABOUT JUST WHAT WAS GOING ON DURING THIS TIME WITH THE WITCH TRIALS. SOME SAY IT WAS MASS HYSTERIA. SOME SAY IT WAS PURITANICAL PARANOIA. SOME SAY IT WAS JUST SOME TEENAGE GIRLS GOING WILD. WOW. OH, WOW. MY GOODNESS. THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL SPACE. THIS PLACE IS PRETTY COOL. YEAH. JUST LIKE LIVING IN PRISON... WHICH EVERYONE WANTS TO BE. HEY, GUYS. HOW ARE YOU? COME ON IN. HEY, GOOD TO SEE YOU. GOOD TO SEE YOU. WOW! BEAUTIFUL PLACE YOU HAVE. HEY. I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU REALLY LIVE IN AN OLD PRISON. YEAH. YOU GO THROUGH ALL THAT DARK, YOU KNOW, CREEPY STUFF, AND THEN YOU HAVE A NICE, COMFORTING APARTMENT. WE LIVE IN THE OLD SALEM JAIL IN SALEM, MASSACHUSETTS. IT WAS BUILT IN 1813. IT IS ACTUALLY ON THE SITE OF THE OLD DUNGEON FROM THE 1600s. SO MANY PEOPLE WERE PUT TO DEATH HERE, AND THAT'S JUST NICE AND COZY FOR US. SO, ARE YOU GUYS READY? I MEAN, WE GOT THE STUFF OUT IN THE HALLWAY. KIND OF THINK YOU'LL LIKE IT. ABSOLUTELY. CAN'T WAIT TO SEE IT. THIS IS THE FIRST THING WE GOT FOR YOU, ACTUALLY. THIS IS A... A HEADHUNTER'S SPEAR. WOW. THE IGURAT PEOPLE WERE HEADHUNTERS, AND OFTEN, THE PERSON WHO THREW THE FIRST SPEAR, THEY WOULD WANT HIS HEAD. CUT HIS HEAD OFF, SOMETIMES HANDS, FEET. THEY WOULD CUT UP ALL SORTS OF BITS AND PIECES. VERY HUMANE. THE NEXT PIECE WE GOT FOR YOU IS FROM THE CONGO, IN AFRICA. BUT IT IS A CEREMONIAL EXECUTIONER'S SWORD. WOW. OH, MAN, I LOVE IT. YEAH, THEY GO GREAT TOGETHER. IT WAS ACTUALLY USED FOR THE BEHEADING OF SLAVES. YEAH. THAT'S A REALLY COOL PIECE. YOU'LL SEE THAT NOTCH IN THERE. THAT WOULD PROBABLY HIT YOUR NECK AND THEN JUST CUT OUT FROM THERE. HOPEFULLY. THE NEXT THING WE GOT, THAT'S THE THING THAT FITS RIGHT HERE. LET ME GO GET THAT FOR YOU. THE FACT THAT THIS THING IS STILL FLOATING AROUND OUT THERE WAS, YOU KNOW, QUITE SURPRISING. OH, BOY! THAT. A PILLORY? THIS GOES GREAT WITH SALEM. THIS IS WONDERFUL. NORMALLY A LITTLE SUSPICIOUS ABOUT THINGS LIKE THIS, 'CAUSE THEY'RE SO WIDELY FAKED, BUT YOU CAN SEE THERE ARE PRETTY GOOD SIGNS OF AGE HERE. OH, RIGHT. YEAH. PRETTY LONG TIME. PEOPLE CAN ACTUALLY FAKE THESE EFFECTS, BUT THIS ONE CERTAINLY HAS A LOT OF AGE TO IT. AND HAS A GREAT SMELL TO IT, TOO. THEY PROBABLY WOULD HAVE HAD SOME IN THE TOWN SQUARE HERE. SURE. PUT YOU IN THERE, AND, YOU KNOW, YOU WERE BAD. THAT'S WHERE YOU WENT. PEOPLE THREW RUBBISH AT YOUR HEAD. WHO KNOWS? YEAH, VERY, VERY COOL. SO, WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK? I MEAN, WE FOUND THESE THINGS FIRST. WE THOUGHT PRETTY MUCH FITS IN WITH WHAT YOU SAID YOU WERE LOOKING FOR. AND THEN WE FOUND THIS, AND WE SORT OF KNEW WE HAD IT. ALL OF IT'S VERY GNARLY AND VERY KIND OF NASTY. SO, YEAH, YOU GUYS DID A GREAT JOB. IT'S JUST AMAZING. THERE IS A SLIGHT CATCH. WE DID GO A LITTLE OVER BUDGET. OKAY. UM... HOW MUCH IS A LITTLE? UH, EVERYTHING CAME OUT TO $4,200... $4,200? FOR ALL THE PIECES. HOWEVER, YOU KNOW, MINUS THE CREDIT THAT WE HAVE FROM THE SHOP FROM THE PIECE YOU BROUGHT IN, IT WOULD BRING IT DOWN TO $3,500. AND HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT? YEAH? I THINK SO. IT'S A NICE LITTLE TORTURE COLLECTION. YEAH. IT'S A NICE LITTLE GRISLY COLLECTION. WE REALLY, REALLY LIKE IT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. YOU GOT SOME INSTRUMENTS OF TORTURE TO DO WITH AS YOU WISH. WELL, THIS WAS DEFINITELY A VERY PRODUCTIVE TRIP AT BRIMFIELD. WE GOT TO SEE CHRIS AND AMY AND THEIR CREEPY JAILHOUSE HOME. THIS STUFF IS GONNA FIT IN PERFECTLY WITH THEIR DECOR. HOPEFULLY, IT WILL, YOU KNOW, KEEP THE EVIL SPIRITS AWAY... OR, IN THIS CASE, MAYBE EVEN LET THEM IN. THIS WOULD LOOK REALLY COOL ON THAT WALL OVER THERE. SURE, YEAH. IT'S KIND OF SCREAMING FOR IT.
