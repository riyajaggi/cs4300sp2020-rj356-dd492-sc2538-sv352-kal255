 THIS IS "ODDITIES." HEY. HOW YOU DOING? HOW'S IT GOING? - HI! - HOW ARE YOU GUYS? - WHAT ARE YOU DOING - IN TOWN? MY HUSBAND AND I ARE VISITING SOME FRIENDS. I'M HERE 'CAUSE I WANT TO FIND SOMETHING ELSE - TO ADD - TO HIS COLLECTION. - HOW'D THAT - OTHER PIECE GO? - AWESOME. - HE LOVED IT. THE LAST TIME I WAS AT OBSCURA, I PURCHASED A TWO-FACED KITTEN. - OH, MY GOSH. - WHAT IS THAT? WOW. TODAY, I'M HOPING THAT EVAN AND MIKE WOULD BE ABLE TO HELP ME FIND SOMETHING FREAKISH TO GO ALONG WITH THAT. HE REALLY LOVED THE CAT, - SO IF I COULD FIND SOMETHING - SIMILAR TO THAT, THAT WOULD BE REALLY COOL. - ACTUALLY, OVER HERE - IN THIS CABINET. THERE YOU GO. WOW. WHAT KIND OF ANIMAL IS THIS? THEY'RE PUPPIES. - PUPPIES! - A COUPLE OF PUPPIES. AW! IT'S A REALLY WEIRD DIVISION, TOO. IF YOU LOOK AT THE FACE, THE LIP IS JUST BARELY SPLIT, AND THEN FROM THERE IT'S THE TWO BODIES. IT'S WHAT THEY CALL A CRANIO-THORACOPAGUS TWIN. - THAT'S NOT HIS NAME. - THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE. YOU COULD NAME THEM THAT. CRANIO-THORACOPAGUS TWINS ARE CONNECTED AT THE HEAD, THE NECK, AND THE CHEST. - THE ARMS AND LEGS - ARE ALL SEPARATE. - THIS HAPPENS - WHEN A FERTILIZED EGG DOESN'T COMPLETELY SEPARATE INTO IDENTICAL TWINS. IT'S A SUPER-RARE CONDITION, AND THEY'RE USUALLY STILLBORN OR DIE SHORTLY AFTER. - THESE PUPS PROBABLY - DIDN'T LAST A DAY. - THE BACK'S - KIND OF INTERESTING. - IT LOOKS AS IF THEY'RE SORT OF - HOLDING HANDS BACK THERE. BUDDIES. FRIENDS FOREVER. FRIENDS FOREVER. AND EVER AND EVER. SO, HOW MUCH WOULD HE... SHE GO FOR? - THEY. - THEY. - HOW MUCH - WOULD THEY GO FOR? - YOU'VE BOUGHT OTHER THINGS - FROM US. OUR BEST COULD BE LIKE... YOU KNOW, LIKE...$650, WE COULD DO. YEAH, 6 1/2. - THANKS. - YOU GOT A DEAL. THANK YOU. JUST ASK IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. I AM AT OBSCURA TODAY BECAUSE I AM LOOKING FOR A CENTERPIECE TO DISPLAY THAT IS GOING TO BE A SHOWSTOPPER. I'M ACTUALLY LOOKING FOR SOMETHING FOR LIGHT THERAPY. WHAT KIND OF LIGHT THERAPY? YOU KNOW, FOR MOOD, FOR ECZEMA, FOR PSORIASIS. SO, TO USE OR DISPLAY? DISPLAY. - JUST KIND OF LIKE - A CONVERSATION PIECE. - Evan: - LIGHT THERAPY'S BEEN CONSIDERED - QUACK MEDICINE FOR A LONG TIME, OF EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY. U.V. LIGHT HAS BEEN USED TO TREAT PSORIASIS, - AND FULL-SPECTRUM WHITE LIGHT - IS VERY EFFECTIVE AGAINST SEASONAL DEPRESSION. I'M LOOKING FOR SOMETHING COOL, SOMETHING UNIQUE, SOMETHING RARE. - SOME KIND OF A SHOWPIECE - FOR MY BUSINESS. - I WANT PEOPLE TO WALK IN - AND THEY SEE IT... A REAL EYE-GRABBER. - SOMEONE WALKS BY, - THEY'RE LIKE, "WHAT IS THAT?" - WHAT KIND OF BUSINESS - ARE YOU IN? I OWN A TANNING SALON. WELL, THAT EXPLAINS THE LOVELY TAN. - WELL, - THANK YOU VERY MUCH. TANNING HAS GOTTEN SUCH A BAD RAP LATELY, BUT EVERYBODY ALWAYS FORGETS ABOUT THE GOOD PART OF IT. - YOU WANT SOMETHING - PERTAINING - TO THE HISTORY - OF LIGHT THERAPY. ABSOLUTELY. OR TANNING. - DEFINITELY. - LIGHT THERAPY, HELIOTHERAPY. THAT'S A TALL ORDER. I'M A TALL GIRL. WELL, WE KNOW A FEW COLLECTORS WHO COLLECT OLD MEDICAL STUFF. - WHAT KIND OF BUDGET - ARE YOU LOOKING AT? I WILL WARN YOU THAT THE OLDER AND THE NEATER AND THE MORE RARE, THE PRICES DO GO UP. I HAVE A BUDGET... MAYBE $5,000. OH, OKAY. OH. - I'LL BE LOOKING FORWARD - TO HEARING FROM YOU. - WE'LL BE GIVING YOU - A CALL. - THIS IS GONNA BE - A REALLY TOUGH SEARCH. - MOST LIGHT THERAPY DEVICES - I'VE SEEN - ARE SORT OF PLAIN - AND NOT REALLY SHOWSTOPPERS. BUT LUCKILY LORI HAS A REALLY HEALTHY BUDGET. JOHN! - John: - HI. HOW ARE YOU? - HOW GOOD - TO SEE YOU AGAIN. - NICE TO SEE YOU. MY NAME IS JOHN FOXELL. I AM A RETIRED MAN. I'VE BEEN COMING TO OBSCURA AROUND 20 YEARS. MY HOUSE FEELS TO ME LIKE AN EXTENSION OF THEIR STORE. WHEN I COME TO THEIR STORE, I FEEL LIKE I'M HOME. WHAT DO WE HAVE TODAY THAT I MIGHT LOOK AT THAT WOULD BE... I SEE THIS. - THIS REMINDS ME - OF A PELVIS... A DEFORMED PELVIS THAT I THINK I BOUGHT FROM YOU AROUND 1989. - YEAH, - THAT'S A REALLY NEAT ONE. THAT'S LATE 19th OR VERY, VERY EARLY 20th CENTURY. IS IT A MAN OR A WOMAN? - I WISH I KNEW MORE - ABOUT WHICH... - YOU KNOW, - 'CAUSE EVEN MY SKELETONS, - I DO NOT KNOW WHICH SEX - THEY ARE. THERE'S A FEW WAYS TO TELL A MALE FROM A FEMALE SKELETON. ONE IS BY USING THE SKULL. THE BROW RIDGE ON A MALE IS MORE PROMINENT THAN ON A FEMALE SKULL. THE OTHER WAY YOU CAN TELL IS THE PELVIS ITSELF. - IF IT WAS BIG ENOUGH - FOR CHILDBIRTH. CHILD BIRTHING. EXACTLY. - USUALLY THE MALE - ARE ALSO MORE CONICAL, - THE INSIDE - OF THE PELVIS, - WHEREAS THE FEMALE - ARE MORE CYLINDRICAL. - AND SO DO YOU THINK - THIS ONE WAS? YEP, THAT'S A MALE. HUH. - IS THIS - WHAT YOU HAD IN MIND? ACTUALLY, I'M NOT SURE THAT IT IS. SINCE I HAVE THE DEFORMED PELVIS... YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PELVISES I NEED. YOU'VE GOT THE BEST. WHAT I'D LIKE TO SEE - IS SOMETHING - THAT'S KIND OF TAKEN APART, - SOMETHING THAT GOES - A LITTLE DEEPER, SOMETHING DIFFERENT. WE ACTUALLY DID GET A PIECE LIKE THAT RECENTLY... A BEAUTIFUL SKULL. I KNOW YOU HAVE A LOT OF SKULLS. I DO. - BUT THERE'S CUTS AND FLAPS - AND HINGES. IT LOOKS LIKE THE ADVENT CALENDAR OF SKULLS. - IT'S REALLY - QUITE A BEAUTIFUL PIECE. - SOUNDS LIKE THIS IS - GONNA MAKE MY DAY. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT IT. WALK THIS WAY. THERE WE GO. AAH! A LIGHT THERAPY MACHINE. COME ON OVER THIS WAY. WOW! - OH, MAN. - THAT'S A MONSTER. THAT'S BEAUTIFUL. Mike: THIS IS "ODDITIES." - John: - WHAT I'D LIKE TO SEE - IS SOMETHING THAT'S KIND OF - TAKEN APART, SOMETHING THAT GOES A LITTLE DEEPER - THAN JUST - THE SYMBOLIC SKELETON. SOMETHING DIFFERENT. - WE ACTUALLY DID GET A PIECE - LIKE THAT RECENTLY... A BEAUTIFUL SKULL. - THERE'S CUTS AND FLAPS - AND HINGES. - IT LOOKS LIKE THE ADVENT - CALENDAR OF SKULLS. - IT'S REALLY QUITE - A BEAUTIFUL PIECE. - SOUNDS LIKE THIS IS - GONNA MAKE MY DAY. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT IT. WALK THIS WAY. - Mike: - THERE WE GO. - WELL, LOOK AT THAT. - THAT'S VERY INTERESTING. - AND WHAT LOOKS LIKE - THE NERVES - ARE ACTUALLY - STRINGS THEY ATTACHED - SHOWING BASICALLY HOW THE NERVES - AND ARTERIES AND VEINS - ALL ATTACH TO THE ROOT - OF THE TEETH. IT ALSO HAS LITTLE FLAPS THAT OPEN UP EVERYWHERE TO SHOW YOU ALL THE SINUSES THERE. THAT'S REALLY NEAT. - OH, IT'S EVERYWHERE. - THAT'S WHAT I SAID. - THIS THING - HAS FLAPS UPON FLAPS. - BUT THEN IT HAS - SO MUCH MORE. IT'S GOT HINGES UP ON TOP. YOU CAN ACTUALLY REMOVE THE CALVARIUM. THEY DREW THE VEINS AND THE ARTERIES. - YOU CAN ACTUALLY - UNHOOK THE JAW. OH, I SEE. AAH! THERE WE GO. IF YOU OPEN UP THAT HOOK, THE ENTIRE SKULL SPLITS IN HALF. THIS CUTAWAY SKULL WAS USED AS A TEACHING MODEL. IT SHOWS ALL THE INNER WORKINGS OF THE SKULL, THE NERVES, THE TEETH. - THEY SHOW THE EAR CANAL, - THE SINUS, ALL THAT SORT OF THING. - THIS PIECES DATES TO ABOUT - THE MIDDLE OF THE 20th CENTURY, AND IT'S FAIRLY RARE. WHAT I CAN SEE IS THE INCREDIBLE DELICACY AND PRECISION WITH WHICH THEY HAD TO OPEN THESE THINGS UP. - THIS ONE IS JUST - SUPER CLEAN. - IT SORT OF - LOOKS A LOT LIKE YOU. THANK YOU, JOHN. CAN I AFFORD IT OR NOT? A SKULL LIKE THIS FOR YOU WOULD BE SOMEWHERE AROUND $2,500 OR IN THAT BALLPARK. MAYBE WE'LL EVEN SHAVE OFF A LITTLE BIT MORE FOR YOU. - WELL, LET'S SEE - WHAT WE COULD SHAVE OFF - WITHOUT ACTUALLY TAKING ANYTHING - OFF THE SKULL ITSELF. HE'S ALREADY BEEN SHAVED, I THINK, QUITE A BIT. I THINK MAYBE IF WE WENT DOWN TO... - YOU KNOW, - I COULD GO $2,000. I THINK THAT WOULD BE PROBABLY GOOD FOR ME, ANYWAY. USUALLY I'D SAY NO, BUT IT IS YOU, AND YOU HAVE BEEN COMING IN FOR MANY YEARS. AND I THINK... AND I THINK WE HAVE A DEAL. COME TO PAPA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. - I THINK IT'S A MATCH - MADE IN HEAVEN. YES, THANK YOU. YOU'RE WELCOME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, JOHN. WE'RE ON THE HUNT FOR A VINTAGE OR ANTIQUE LIGHT THERAPY DEVICE FOR A CUSTOMER OF OURS. SHE WANTS SOMETHING WITH A REAL WOW FACTOR, A REAL SHOWSTOPPER TO USE IN HER TANNING SALON. WE FOUND A COLLECTOR OUT IN PENNSYLVANIA WHO SAYS THAT HE HAS EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR. HELLO. - HI. - GOOD TO SEE YOU. SAME HERE. - MIKE. GOOD TO SEE YOU. - THANKS FOR HAVING US OVER. - GREAT STUFF - YOU GOT HERE. WOW. LOOK AT ALL THESE HORNS. I'M CURTIS NASE. - I REBUILD AND RESTORE - PHONOGRAPHS AND OTHER MECHANICAL MACHINES. I BRING IT BACK TO LIFE AND THEN TAKE IT OUT AND SELL IT. THESE ARE GREAT PIECES. I REBUILD THEM, RESTORE THEM. WOW. - THAT IS A GREAT - COLLECTION. SO, YOU SAID YOU HAD A LIGHT THERAPY MACHINE. - YEAH. - YEAH, I DO. - CAN WE TAKE A LOOK? - ABSOLUTELY. COME ON OVER THIS WAY. - YEAH, - IT'S RIGHT OVER HERE. OH. IT'S A DUPLEX MAJOR UNIVERSAL DEEP THERAPY LAMP. - Mike: - THAT'S A MONSTER. DO YOU HAVE A DATE ON IT? I DON'T KNOW FOR SURE, BUT TO ME IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S MID '20s. THE PORCELAIN LOOKS LIKE IT'S OF THAT ERA. - I CAN PULL IT OUT - FOR YOU. YEAH, YEAH, PLEASE. - IT COMES RIGHT OUT THERE - JUST LIKE THAT. - DOES IT RAISE - AND LOWER AS WELL? IT'LL GO UP AND DOWN... REALLY QUITE EASILY. IT HAS A LARGE CAST IRON COUNTERWEIGHT INSIDE THERE. THE WAY THIS DEVICE WOULD WORK IS, - A DOCTOR WOULD - HAVE YOU LAY DOWN ON A TABLE. - THEY WOULD POSITION THIS - OVER YOU, - WHEREVER THEY DEEMED YOU NEEDED - THIS LIGHT THERAPY THE MOST. THIS IS THE BULB THAT CAME WITH IT... VERY LARGE. 1,500 WATTS. THAT'S A BRIGHT BULB. THAT'S A BRIGHT BULB THIS BULB DOESN'T LOOK LIKE A FULL SPECTRUM BULB, - SO THEY'RE BASICALLY - PUTTING YOU UNDER A VERY, VERY BRIGHT LIGHT BULB, WHICH MIGHT NOT HAVE ALL THE HEALING POWERS - OF A FULL SPECTRUM - LIGHT. - THIS WOULD - KIND OF BAKE YOU. - I SUPPOSE. - I SUPPOSE. DOES IT STILL WORK? THERE'S A MODERN BULB IN THERE. SO, BASICALLY IT'S SORT OF A LAMP LAMP. AT THIS POINT, YEAH. YOU CAN HAVE LIGHT TO READ BY IF YOU'D LIKE. - THE MOST INTENSE - READING LIGHT EVER. YES, IT'S A LOVELY FLOOR LAMP. - I REALLY LIKED - THIS LIGHT THERAPY DEVICE, BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S QUITE THE SHOWSTOPPER OUR CUSTOMER IS LOOKING FOR. - IT'S BASICALLY - A GIANT FOOD WARMER. - I DON'T THINK OUR CUSTOMER'S - GONNA WANT THAT - ASSOCIATED - WITH THEIR TANNING SALON. - WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK? - ARE YOU INTERESTED IN THE PIECE? I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S GONNA WORK FOR US. SO IT'S NOT QUITE THE THING? I THINK WE MIGHT HAVE TO PASS ON THIS ONE. WELL, LET ME SHOW YOU OUT, THEN. COME ON OVER THIS WAY. THAT I WAS LOOKING TO SELL. - IT WOULD HAVE TO BE - KIND OF SPECIAL. I THINK YOU'RE GONNA BE STOKED ON THIS ONE. - TAKE A LOOK - AT THIS LITTLE GUY. IT'S GOT INVISIBLE SKIN. OH, WOW! Mike: THIS IS "ODDITIES." EVAN AND I HAVE COME UP EMPTY-HANDED LOOKING FOR A REAL SHOWSTOPPING LIGHT THERAPY DEVICE, BUT WHEN IT COMES TO ANTIQUE MEDICAL DEVICES, WE KNOW A GUY WHO HAS THE BEST COLLECTION WE'VE EVER FOUND. - HEY, STEVE. - HOW YOU DOING? - HEY, HI. - GOOD TO SEE YOU. - GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. - COME ON IN. THE PROBLEM IS STEVE ONLY SELLS AN ITEM OUT OF HIS COLLECTION IF HE HAS A SIMILAR ONE TO IT, AND WITH A COLLECTION AS SPECIALIZED AS HIS, THAT RARELY HAPPENS. WOW. THIS COLLECTION IS ALWAYS INCREDIBLE. THANKS. I'VE BEEN COLLECTING FOR OVER 30 YEARS... MEDICAL, SCIENTIFIC, INDUSTRIAL OBJECTS THAT HAVE THE RIGHT LOOK... SOME SOUL, SOME PERSONALITY, AND RARE. I GOT SOME NEW THINGS. - THIS WAS - A SHOCK THERAPY DEVICE. - Evan: - I CAN'T STOP STARING AT IT. IT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITE THINGS. - Mike: - I LOVE HOW EVERYTHING IN HERE - LOOKS LIKE - IT'S A TORTURE DEVICE. NO, NO. IT'S NOT A TORTURE DEVICE. - IT'S ALL MEDICAL. - IT'S ALL LEGIT. IT'S NOTHING SCARY. BUT THIS HAS EYE CUPS. THEY'D PUT... EVERYWHERE. WHAT IF YOU HAVE A HEADACHE, SINUS PROBLEMS? - NOTHING LIKE SOME ELECTRICITY - THROUGH THE EYEBALLS. THIS THING CURED EVERYTHING FROM HEADACHES TO BALDNESS. - IN FACT, I HAVE ONE MORE - TREATMENT TO GO. EXCELLENT. - I AM IN LOVE - WITH THIS THING. NOT FOR SALE. - BUT I HAVE SOMETHING - TO SHOW YOU. IT'S IN THE OTHER ROOM. LET'S TAKE A LOOK. - AS YOU KNOW, - I USUALLY DON'T SELL THINGS OUT OF MY CORE COLLECTION. I ONLY SELL IF I FIND A SECOND ONE. WOW. OH, WOW. THOSE ARE NICE. THEY CALLED IT SPECTRO-CHROME THERAPY. SPECTRO-CHROME THERAPY WAS DIFFERENT-COLORED LIGHT THROUGH THE EYE, TO THE BRAIN. IT FLASHES LIGHTS AT YOU? IT FLASHED COLORED LIGHT BULBS. THEY FELT THAT RED HELPED THE LIVER - AND YELLOW - HELPED THE BONES. CLEAR WHITE, THAT WAS FOR DEPRESSION. RIGHT. - THIS ITEM IS CLEARLY - A QUACK MEDICAL DEVICE. HOWEVER, THERE IS SOME PROOF - THAT COLORED LIGHTS - DO AFFECT THE BODY... NOT BLOOD AND BONE LIKE THIS PIECE IS SET UP TO DO, BUT FULL SPECTRUM WHITE LIGHT - DOES HELP - WITH SEASONAL DEPRESSION. THIS THING IS EXACTLY THE CONVERSATION STARTER OUR CUSTOMER'S LOOKING FOR. - WAS THAT MADE HERE - IN THE U.S.? I THINK IT MIGHT BE ITALIAN. WE FOUND THEM IN GERMANY. - THEY WERE OUT OF - AN INSANE ASYLUM. - NOW, DID THIS MOUNT - ON SOMETHING? YEAH, THEY BOTH DID. - THIS WOULD MOUNT - TO A CHAIR. YOU UNSCREW THAT, AND THEN YOU LIFT IT OFF. - WOW, THAT LOOKS - VERY UNCOMFORTABLE. DO YOU WANT TO TRY IT ON? I'M NOT VERY DEPRESSED RIGHT NOW. - I'M DEPRESSED THAT YOU DON'T - WANT TO TRY IT. OH, GO AHEAD. YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO. - YOU KNOW - I WANT TO DO IT. - IT'S ALL PART - OF THE EXPERIENCE. - I GUESS - WE SHOULDN'T ASK A CLIENT - TO DO ANYTHING - WE WOULDN'T DO. OH, YEAH. I CAN SEE WHERE THIS WOULD BE VERY, VERY, THERAPEUTIC. THIS THING IS LIKE INCHES FROM YOUR EYEBALL. SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK? I'LL LET EITHER ONE GO. IT'S UP TO YOU. I THINK THIS IS GONNA WORK. WELL, WHAT'S YOUR PRICE ON THESE? $5,000 EACH. YEAH, THAT'S... - I BOUGHT THIS - 30 YEARS AGO. IT TOOK ME ANOTHER 30 YEARS TO FIND THE SECOND ONE, - SO THAT'S HOW RARE - THEY ARE. IT'S A BIT MORE THAN OUR BUDGET IS. IS THERE ANY WIGGLE ROOM ON THIS? SO YOU'RE ASKING FOR AN OBSCURA DISCOUNT. LOOK, I CAN DO $4,500, BUT THE NEXT GREAT THING YOU HAVE, YOU'VE GOT TO BRING IT BACK HERE. SO, WHAT DO YOU... $500 OFF SEEMS... DOABLE. OKAY, GREAT. - $4,500 IT IS. - YOU GOT A DEAL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO FIND A BOX. HELLO. HOW'S IT GOING? GOOD. HOW ARE YOU GUYS? MY NAME'S JASPER. I CO-OWN A BAR CALLED HOME SWEET HOME FILLED WITH TONS OF TAXIDERMY. WE'VE GOT A COYOTE, WE'VE GOT A BOBCAT AND FERRETS SCATTERED THROUGHOUT. - TODAY I'M HERE - TO SELL A PIECE, BUT IT'S A LITTLE TOO FRAGILE FOR US. THINGS GET SHATTERED, THINGS GET THROWN AT MY BAR. IT SEEMS LIKE WE'D PROBABLY JUST DESTROY IT IN THE END, SO I'M HOPING MAYBE IT'LL FIND A BETTER HOME WITH SOMEBODY HERE. - IS THERE ANYTHING - WE CAN HELP YOU WITH? WELL, I GUESS I HAD A COUPLE QUESTIONS ABOUT DEER STUFF. UH-HUH. - DO YOU GUYS - BUY ANY DEER STUFF? YEAH. I MEAN, IT'S LIKE ONE OF THOSE PIECES OF TAXIDERMY THAT WE FIND ALL THE TIME. WE'VE GOTTEN, LIKE, ALBINO DEER BEFORE. THOSE TEND TO DO WELL. I'VE GOT A PRETTY ODD DEER PIECE... YEAH? THAT I WAS LOOKING TO SELL. WELL, IT WOULD HAVE TO BE KIND OF SPECIAL. I THINK YOU'RE GONNA BE STOKED ON THIS ONE. - YOU HAVE IT HERE? - I DO. - I GOT IT RIGHT HERE. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS LITTLE GUY. OH, WOW! Mike: THIS IS "ODDITIES." I'VE GOT A PRETTY ODD DEER PIECE... YEAH? - ...THAT I WAS LOOKING - TO SELL. WELL, IT WOULD HAVE TO BE KIND OF SPECIAL. I THINK YOU'RE GONNA BE STOKED ON THIS ONE. - YOU HAVE IT HERE? - I DO. - I GOT IT RIGHT HERE. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS LITTLE GUY. IT'LL BLOW YOUR MIND. OH, WOW! A DIAPHONIZED DEER FETUS. OH, THAT'S A BEAUTY. OH, VERY, VERY COOL. THAT'S ACTUALLY A PRETTY BIG SPECIMEN FOR THIS TYPE OF PREPARATION. DIAPHONIZATION IS A LENGTHY CHEMICAL PROCESS IN WHICH THE CARTILAGE IS DYED BLUE, THE BONE IS DYED RED, AND THE SKIN IS RENDERED CLEAR. AND IT'S USED TO SHOW THE DEVELOPMENTAL STAGES OF CARTILAGE TO BONE. THIS TYPE OF PREPARATION TAKES AN INCREDIBLY LONG TIME. MOST OF THIS IS DONE BY SOAKING IN CHEMICALS. IT IS SKINNED. - YOU DISEMBOWEL IT - TO TAKE OUT THE ORGANS. YOU CAN SEE IN BETWEEN EACH OF THE BONES, LIKE IN THE ARM AND THE RIBS AND THE SKULL, - THE BLUE SECTIONS - ARE ALL CARTILAGE. THERE IS MUSCLE LEFT. - THAT'S WHAT ACTUALLY - BECOMES CLEAR. WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF THESE COME THROUGH THE STORE, - BUT THEY'RE GENERALLY - REALLY SMALL. - YOU KNOW, MICE. - FISH ARE AN EASIER PREPARATION. BUT THIS VERY LARGE ONE, THIS MIGHT HAVE TAKEN A COUPLE MONTHS TO PREPARE. I BOUGHT IT OFF A VETERINARIAN TO PUT IN MY BAR, BUT IT'S A LITTLE TOO FRAGILE FOR US. PEOPLE THROW GLASSWARE. I'M AFRAID OF THAT GETTING SMASHED AND GETTING DEADLY CHEMICALS EVERYWHERE. - SO, WHAT WERE YOU LOOKING - TO GET FOR THIS? I WAS HOPING TO GET MAYBE $250. IT'S A LITTLE TOO CLOSE TO RETAIL. IT IS A NICE, OLD SPECIMEN. WOULD YOU TAKE MAYBE $200 FOR THIS? I WOULD PART WITH MY LITTLE DEER FOR $200. - $200 SOUNDS PRETTY FAIR. - WE'RE HAPPY. - THANK YOU. - THANK YOU. THANKS, MAN. LET'S GO OVER HERE. - HI, GUYS. - IT'S ME. WHAT'D YOU FIND FOR ME? IT WAS NOT EASY. LORI'S BACK AT OBSCURA TO SEE THE PIECE WE GOT FOR HER TANNING SALON. I MEAN, THIS THING IS THE PERFECT CENTERPIECE, HOWEVER, WE DID GO A BIT OVER BUDGET. ARE YOU READY? - I'M READY. - I'M READY. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. WE ACTUALLY WENT TO A FEW DIFFERENT PEOPLE TO LOOK FOR THIS ITEM. WE'RE PRETTY EXCITED. THIS IS A HAND-CARVED HEAD. A HEAD. IT'S A NICE ONE. I MEAN, A SOLID ONE. IT GETS BETTER. - IT'S ACTUALLY A NICE PIECE - IN ITSELF, - BUT I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. - IT'S WHAT GOES ON - THE HEAD. I WAS GONNA SAY. WELL, LOOKEE HERE. SO, YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS? NO FRICKING CLUE. - WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK - THIS LOOKS LIKE? - WHEN YOU FIRST - BROUGHT IT OUT, THE FIRST THING I THOUGHT - WAS THAT YOU WERE GOING - TO ELECTROCUTE AND KILL ME, ACTUALLY. - THAT'S WHAT COMES - TO MIND. - IT COULD HAPPEN. LET'S HOPE NOT. IF YOU TAKE A LOOK IN HERE... OH! - SEE THE BULBS? - YES. - THEY LOOK EXACTLY - LIKE THE LAMPS - THAT ARE IN MY FACE TANNERS - IN MY TANNING BEDS. IT'S HELIOTHERAPY. IT'S A HELIOTHERAPY HELMET. THIS IS A PRETTY EARLY DEVICE. DO I GET TO TRY IT ON? - IT WILL NOT LIGHT UP. - WE WILL WARN YOU. - DON'T WORRY, - I DON'T WANT TO LIGHT IT UP. I JUST WANT TO FEEL IT ON MY NOG. THOSE GO RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOUR EYES THERE. SEE? I LOVE IT. DO YOU FEEL A LITTLE TRAPPED? I FEEL SO EXCITED I WANT TO JUMP UP AND DOWN. DON'T WITH THE HELMET ON. THIS ACTUALLY CAME OUT OF A SANITARIUM. IT WAS ACTUALLY USED FOR PEOPLE WHO HAD MENTAL DISORDERS. - IT WAS THOUGHT THAT... - AGAIN, HELIOTHERAPY... - IT WAS THOUGHT THAT THE LIGHT - COULD CURE THEM, MAKE THEM LESS ANXIOUS. REALLY? SO THIS IS AN AUTHENTIC, VERY EARLY FORM OF HELIOTHERAPY. SO, DOES THIS FIT THE BILL? YES, IT'S PERFECT. IT'S EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR. - THAT PERFECT - LITTLE SHOWPIECE TO PUT IN MY LOBBY SO THAT EVERYBODY THAT WALKS IN SAYS, "WHAT THE HECK THIS IS?" NOW, WE DID HAVE TO PAY QUITE A BIT FOR IT. NOW, WHAT ARE WE TALKING... LIKE, WHAT'S "A BIT"? - WE ACTUALLY GOT THIS - FROM A COLLECTOR - WHO'S BEEN DEALING - FOR 30-PLUS YEARS. - THIS IS THE SECOND ONE HE'S SEEN - IN ALL THAT TIME. BUT WE COULDN'T PASS THIS UP. WE CAME A LITTLE HIGHER THAN YOUR BUDGET. SO WE'RE GONNA ASK, LIKE, $5,500. I KNOW THAT'S A LITTLE MORE THAN WE WERE HOPING ON. HOW ABOUT... CAN I MAKE A SUGGESTION? HOW ABOUT LET'S GO RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE? $5,250... AND FREE TANNING FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. BECAUSE YOU BOTH NEED IT. - FOR THE REST - OF OUR LIVES? - FOR THE REST - OF YOUR LIVES. FABULOUS! YAY! - THANK YOU VERY MUCH. - I HAVE A HELMET. I CAN HARDLY WAIT. - WRAP THIS UP FOR YOU? - YES, PLEASE! - DO YOU WANT TO - WEAR IT OUT? - I WAS GONNA JUST ASK IF I COULD - WEAR IT OUT, BUT NO. - YEAH, WRAP IT UP. - ALL RIGHT. - ON WHAT EVAN AND I THOUGHT - WAS THE PERFECT ITEM, IT TOTALLY PAID OFF. - I MEAN, I'M FEELING PRETTY GOOD - RIGHT NOW. - MAYBE THERE IS SOMETHING TO - THIS WHOLE LIGHT THERAPY THING.
