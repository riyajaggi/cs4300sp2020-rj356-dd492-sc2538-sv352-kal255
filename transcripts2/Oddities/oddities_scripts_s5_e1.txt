 TO GET THIS BUSINESS... DOWN TO A SCIENCE. THIS IS THE "ODDITIES HOLIDAY BIZARRE." FIT MIKE PRETTY WELL. YEAH. LOOKS LIKE HE'S IN ANTHRAX. YES. OH, YEAH. HEY, PETE, HOW YOU DOING? WHAT, UH... FESTIVE. IT'S THE HOLIDAY. GIVE SOMEONE A SEIZURE... ALL THE BLINKS. OH, YEAH. I KNOW. PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY I'M A BIT OF A MAD HATTER, BUT... UH-HUH. THEY CALL ME PETE THE REPTILE MAN. I PREPARE A LOT OF SPECIMENS FOR DIFFERENT ART AND SCIENCE PROJECTS WITH VARIOUS MUSEUMS AND UNIVERSITIES AND PRIVATE COLLECTORS, AS WELL. I CAME HERE THINKING I WOULD FIND SOMETHING NOT TOO EASY TO GUESS WHAT IT IS... SOMETHING THAT WILL STUMP A LOT OF PEOPLE. I'M PLANNING A PARTY OF ALL MY FAVORITE GRUMPY, OLD, SOCIAL-MISFIT FRIENDS, AND WE'RE GONNA DO A LITTLE SHOW AND TELL OF WEIRD OBJECTS. THAT'S KIND OF COOL. NEAT CONCEPT. IT'S LIKE A LITTLE COMPETITION WHERE EVERYONE TAKES OUT SOMETHING MORE WEIRDER THAN THE FIRST TO SEE WHO IS THE WEIRDEST. SO, THAT'S WHY I CAME HERE. YOU'D BE A HARD GUY TO GO UP AGAINST. THANK YOU. HMM. SO... WELL, WE ACTUALLY HAVE SOMETHING YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE, ACTUALLY. OOH, LA, LA. THAT'S IT. SEE IF YOU CAN GUESS WHAT THIS IS. OOH. THIS IS A PIECE THAT'S NOT NORMALLY OBSERVED. THAT'S AN INTERESTING REACTION. I THINK HE'S PICKING UP ON IT. I USED TO CATCH AND WRESTLE GATORS IN THE GOOD OL' DAYS, AND THIS REMINDS ME OF AN ADULT TANNED AND HIDE AND STRETCHED ALLIGATOR TONGUE. YOU KNOW YOUR TONGUES. OH, I KNOW TONGUES. I CAN SEE ALL THE LITTLE SENSORY PORES AND, YOU KNOW, WHERE IT ATTACHES TO THE MUSCLE. THINK ABOUT IT. YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY'S GONNA ASSUME THAT IT'S JUST PART OF A HIDE. NO, I DON'T THINK ANYONE WILL FIGURE OUT WHAT IT IS. I LOVE IT. WHILE MOST ALLIGATOR ATTACKS AGAINST HUMANS ARE DEADLY, WHAT MAKES THEM SO LETHAL IS NOT THE BITE BUT WHAT'S INSIDE OF THE BITE... INFECTIOUS BACTERIA. THEIR TEETH AND THEIR TONGUES ARE FILLED WITH EXCESSIVE BACTERIA DUE TO THEIR DIET OF ROTTING ANIMAL CARCASSES AND THEIR HABITAT, THE SWAMP, WHICH IS OFTEN REFERRED TO AS NATURE'S TOILET. THIS IS GONNA BE THE BEST GUEST AT THE PARTY. I NEED IT AND I WANT IT. WE HAVE, WHAT, 50 BUCKS ON THAT THING? YEAH. WELL, IT'S THE HOLIDAY SEASON, SO I'LL SPLURGE. NICE SEEING YOU AGAIN, PETE. YOU'VE BEEN CHARMING ME ALL ALONG. OH, WELL. ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE NOT A WITCH? SOME SAY. I'M GONNA GO WANDER AROUND THE NEIGHBORHOOD. BE READY WHEN YOU GET BACK. AU REVOIR. STAY SAFE. ACTUALLY, I KIND OF LIKE PETE'S CONCEPT. MAYBE WE COULD DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT. YEAH, LIKE INVITE PEOPLE AND TELL THEM TO BRING SOMETHING COOL, AND GUESS, LIKE, A SHOW-AND-TELL KIND OF THING. WE CAN BRING ALL THE USUAL SUSPECTS. I LIKE IT. IT'D BE KIND OF COOL. WE'LL HAVE DRINKS AND FOOD AND STUFF. THAT'S COOL. START MAKING SOME CALLS, GETTING SOME STUFF READY. THAT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF FUN. IT'S LIKE LUNCH FOR SCHMUCKS OR SOMETHING. OH! HEY! HEY. WHAT'S UP, GUYS? WHAT'S UP, SES? HOW YOU DOING, MAN? HAVE YOU FINALLY GONE AROUND AND GOTTEN YOUR FACE TATTOOED WITH THIS MAKEUP? NO. NO. I'M NOT GOING PERMA-CLOWN JUST YET. MY NAME IS SES CARNY. MY MOTIF IS AN EVIL CLOWN, AND I'M AN EXTREME SIDESHOW PERFORMER. THE LAST TIME I CAME TO OBSCURA, I BOUGHT A TYPE OF MEDICAL DEVICE, BUT I NEEDED TO FIND SOMETHING A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAT I CAN USE ONSTAGE. I'M KIND OF LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TO USE DURING THESE HOLIDAY SHOWS I'M DOING. MAYBE SOMETHING THAT CAN GO IN THE EYES OR THE MOUTH. THESE ARE KIND OF NEAT. THESE ARE ACTUALLY TWO DIFFERENT STYLES OF THESE THINGS. THEY CALLED IT "DENTAL GAG." THE IDEA OF THIS THING IS YOU PUT IT INTO THE MOUTH, AND AS YOU TIGHTEN THIS PART HERE, IT KEEPS YOUR MOUTH OPEN. THIS IS USED DURING DENTAL PROCEDURES. THIS IS ACTUALLY ANOTHER STYLE OF THEM. BASICALLY, YOUR TEETH GO ON THESE LITTLE RIDGES, AND AS YOU TURN THIS, IT OPENS THEM UP. I LIKE THAT. HE'S PUTTING THEM IN HIS MOUTH THERE. THAT'S WHERE IT BELONGS. GOOD THING WE DIDN'T SHOW THE PROCTOLOGIST STUFF. HOW MUCH IS IT? WHAT DID YOU SAY? HOW MUCH IS IT? WHAT DO WE GOT ON THAT ONE? WE HAVE ABOUT 100 BUCKS ON THAT PIECE. 100 BUCKS? YEAH. THAT'S A LITTLE MORE THAN I WAS LOOKING TO SPEND TODAY. RIGHT. BUT I COULD DO THIS NEW STUNT, AND IF YOU LIKE IT, MAYBE CUT A DEAL? OH, TOTALLY. YOU HOLD ON TO THAT. OKAY. THE ONE THING I GOT TO SAY IS DO NOT TRY ANYTHING YOU SEE ME DO AT HOME. WHAT, CHRISTMAS DECORATIONS? IT'S A BED OF BARBED WIRE. I'M GONNA LAY DOWN ON MY BACK ON THIS. AND THEN RYAN... HUH? YOU JUMP ON ME WHILE I'M LAYING ON IT. NEVER ACTUALLY TRIED THIS BEFORE. WELL, PLEASE BE CAREFUL. FESTIVE! WE DO HAVE INSURANCE. HOWEVER, I DON'T KNOW IF IT COVERS CLOWNS AND BARBED WIRE. BARBED-WIRE TRAGEDIES. YEAH. OOH. OKAY. AH, HOW DOES THAT FEEL? OH, THIS IS NOT GOOD IN THE SLIGHTEST. PLACE LOOKS AMAZING. - ANY NEW STUFF COME IN? - TONS OF NEW STUFF. WHAT DO YOU THINK? OH, THAT'S CRAZY. THIS PLACE IS GREAT. AND THIS ACTUALLY LOOKS FAMILIAR. THEY WOULD BE USED TO SHOW YOUR PROWESS IN WAR. AND I'VE ONLY GOT ONE IN MY COLLECTION. YOU'RE NOT A WARRIOR. THIS IS THE "ODDITIES HOLIDAY BIZARRE." - 100 BUCKS? - YEAH. THAT'S A LITTLE MORE THAN I WAS LOOKING TO SPEND TODAY. BUT I COULD DO THIS NEW STUNT, AND IF YOU LIKE IT, MAYBE CUT A DEAL? OH, TOTALLY. IT'S A BED OF BARBED WIRE. I'M GONNA LAY DOWN ON MY BACK ON THIS. RIGHT. AND THEN RYAN, YOU JUMP ON ME WHILE I'M LAYING ON IT. DO NOT TRY ANYTHING YOU SEE ME DO AT HOME. PLEASE BE CAREFUL. YEAH. OOH. OKAY. AH, HOW DOES THAT FEEL? OH, THIS IS NOT GOOD IN THE SLIGHTEST. DOES IT HURT, OR ARE YOU OKAY? I DON'T SEE BLOOD COMING OUT YET. OH, MAN. YOU ALL RIGHT? OKAY. FEEL LIKE I'M SURFING ON A CLOWN. NOW, WHEN I SAY GO, JUST GIVE A LITTLE HOP. AND... GO. OH, DUDE. I KIND OF FELT SOMETHING DIG IN. IT WAS, LIKE, A REALLY WEIRD SENSATION. OKAY. NOW STEP OFF ME. SLOWLY. SLOWLY. OH, BOY, YOU'RE A HEAVY DUDE. OH, MAN, LOOK AT THAT. YOUR BACK, DUDE. BUT NO BLOOD. I FEEL LIKE I'VE JUST BEEN PUT THROUGH THE GRINDER. THAT WORTH CUTTING A DEAL? THAT IS WORTH A DEAL AND A HALF, MAN. I WILL CUT IT IN HALF FOR YOU. $50? 50 BUCKS. SOLD. THANKS. LET ME JUST GET MY WALLET. WE'RE ORGANIZING A LITTLE HOLIDAY PARTY FOR THE SHOP WHERE EVERYBODY'S SUPPOSED TO BRING IN AN OBJECT THAT'S SUPPOSED TO SPARK AWE AND CONVERSATION, SO I'M TRYING TO SET THE BAR PRETTY HIGH. I'M GONNA GO VISIT MY BUDDY GOOBY. HE SAID HE HAS SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE ABLE TO HIT MY MARK. WELCOME TO MY HOUSE. OH, WOW. THIS PLACE IS GREAT. IT'S SUCH AN INTERESTING GROUPING OF ITEMS. SOMETIMES, THINGS JUST SCREAM OUT TO ME. YEAH. AND THIS ACTUALLY LOOKS FAMILIAR. YEP. I GOT THAT FROM YOU. I'M GOOBY. I AM AN ANIMATOR, PAINTER, MUSICIAN, COLLECTOR OF VARIOUS ODD THINGS. I'M CANDICE. I'M A SEAMSTRESS, AND I WORK IN VINTAGE CLOTHING. I DO HAVE SOMETHING. NOT SURE IF IT'LL BE APPROPRIATE AT A DINNER PARTY, BUT WE CAN FIND OUT IF YOU LIKE IT OR NOT. OKAY. GOOBY, WHAT THE HECK IS THAT THING? I KNOW, IT'S HARD TO SAY WHEN YOU FIRST LOOK AT IT. BUT IT'S A SCALP. REALLY? WOW. YOU KNOW, THE NATIVE AMERICANS TO HAVE INVENTED SCALPING, BUT IT HAD BEEN DONE WORLDWIDE FOR CENTURIES. EUROPEANS WERE DOING THIS IN 500 B.C. WHAT THEY WOULD BASICALLY DO IS THEY'D KILL AN ENEMY, PUT THEIR FOOT ON THE BACK OF THE SHOULDERS, TAKE THE KNIFE, CUT THE FRONTAL SECTION OF THE SCALP, AND BASICALLY RIP IT RIGHT OFF. THEY WOULD BE USED, BASICALLY, TO SHOW YOUR PROWESS IN WAR. THE MORE SCALPS THAT YOU HAD, THE MORE BADASS YOU WERE, BASICALLY. AND I'VE ONLY GOT ONE IN MY COLLECTION. YOU'RE NOT A WARRIOR. THE SCALP CONTAINS IMPORTANT TISSUES THAT BASICALLY HELP HOLD YOUR FACE UP. AS YOU GET OLDER, YOUR SCALP GETS LOOSER AND HEAVIER, WHICH CAUSE YOUR FOREHEAD AND OTHER FACIAL FEATURES TO DROOP. SCALPING COULD BE LETHAL, BUT IT WASN'T ALWAYS. IF YOU WERE FORTUNATE TO LIVE THROUGH THIS, THE AREA THAT WAS SCALPED WOULD NEVER RE-GROW THE HAIR THAT IT LOST. THIS IS REALLY, REALLY AMAZING. YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU FIRST LOOK AT IT, YOU DON'T NECESSARILY KNOW WHAT THE HECK THIS IS. OH, TOTALLY. SO, I'M DEFINITELY INTERESTED. IS THERE ANY WAY I COULD JUST MAYBE BORROW THIS FOR THE PARTY? OH, YEAH, THAT'S NO PROBLEM. YEAH? IT'S FINE, YEAH. AWESOME. THANK YOU. I'M SURE EVAN AND RYAN ARE OUT BUYING SOME REALLY COOL THINGS FOR OUR HOLIDAY SHOW-AND-TELL PARTY, SO WHAT I'M GONNA DO IS GO VISIT ONE OF MY FAVORITE COLLECTORS AND SEE IF HE HAS SOMETHING SPECIAL FOR ME THAT THEY'LL NEVER EXPECT. HELLO, STEVE. - HEY. - HEY, HOW YOU DOING? THIS PLACE LOOKS AMAZING. YOU ALWAYS HAVE MORE AND MORE STUFF. YEAH, IT'S A SICKNESS. I COLLECT SCIENTIFIC, MEDICAL, TECHNOLOGY. I'VE KNOWN MIKE A LONG TIME, I THINK OVER 20 YEARS NOW. THIS WAREHOUSE... IT'S BY APPOINTMENT ONLY, AND MIKE IS ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE THAT GETS TO COME HERE. WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR? WELL, ANY NEW STUFF COME IN THAT YOU'D RECOMMEND, OR... TONS OF NEW STUFF. COME ON. EXCELLENT. COLLECTION OF HANDS. THOSE ARE NICE HANDS, ACTUALLY. YEAH. OLD MANNEQUIN HANDS? THEY WERE DISPLAY HANDS. MAYBE THEY WERE FOR SELLING GLOVES. BUT WHAT'S INTERESTING IS WHAT'S ON IT. THIS IS HOLDING THE FINGERS IN PLACE. A SPLINT, I GUESS. YEAH. IT'S A SPLINT, BUT FOR THE FINGERS. CAN I LOOK AT THAT, OR... YEAH. SURE. I LIKE THIS THING A LOT, BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S EXACT... HOLY HOLY SMOKES. WE GOT A LITTLE BIT OF EVERYTHING IN HERE. DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING DISGUSTING?

THOSE ARE NICE HANDS, ACTUALLY. BUT WHAT'S INTERESTING IS WHAT'S ON IT. THIS IS HOLDING THE FINGERS IN PLACE. A SPLINT, I GUESS. YEAH. I LIKE THIS THING A LOT, BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S EXACT... HOLY WHOA. LET ME TURN THAT OFF. WHAT THE HELL IS THAT? I THINK IT'S A STEAM VALVE. ANYTHING I CAN DO? NO, NO. IT'S OKAY. LET ME TURN IT OFF. IT'S RIGHT BEHIND HERE. DO YOU WANT ME TO CALL SOMEONE, STEVE? NO, I'M OKAY. IT'S ALL OFF NOW. IT'S JUST A STEAM VALVE. I COULD LEAVE IF YOU NEED TO TAKE CARE OF THIS. WE'RE OKAY. WE'RE OKAY. IF YOU'RE SURE. I'M POSITIVE. ALL RIGHT. COME ON. FORTUNATELY, WHERE THE STEAM PIPE BURST IS GLASS AND RUST AND METAL, SO IT SHOULD BE ALL RIGHT. WE SELL RUST ALL THE TIME. LET ME SHOW YOU THIS OTHER THING. WHAT DO YOU THINK? YOU ROLL IN WITH THIS. THAT'S PRETTY COOL, ACTUALLY. SO, IS THIS A PENNY FARTHING OR A HIGH WHEEL, I GUESS THEY'D CALL THAT. YEAH, IT'S ALL THOSE. LITTLE TIRE, BIG TIRE. THAT'S WHY THEY CALLED THEM A PENNY FARTHING, ENGLISH. YOU KNOW, TWO DIFFERENT COINS. BIG COIN, SMALL COIN. OH, OKAY. IS THIS AN ORIGINAL OR A REPRODUCTION? OH, NO. THIS IS 1880s. THERE'S NO CHAIN. IT'S JUST DIRECT? NO, IT'S DIRECT DRIVE, AND THAT'S WHAT MADE THESE THINGS SO DANGEROUS. YOU'RE BASICALLY SITTING OVER THE AXLE. LET'S SAY YOU HIT A RUT OR A ROCK. YOU'D GO RIGHT OVER. THAT'S CRAZY. DANGEROUS. YEAH. IT'S PRETTY COOL. DEFINITELY NOT MY USUAL KIND OF ITEM. THAT MIGHT WORK, ACTUALLY. NO ONE AT THAT PARTY IS GONNA EVER EXPECT ME TO SHOW UP WITH SOMETHING AS RIDICULOUS AND CRAZY AND WONDERFUL AS THIS. HOW MUCH IS IT? I HAVE IT LISTED AT $4,800. $4,800? YEAH. YEAH. I LIKE IT A LOT AND IT'S DEFINITELY WORTH THAT. I MEAN, THIS AGE, THIS CONDITION, THIS THING'S IMMACULATE. BUT THIS IS JUST FOR THIS PARTY, REALLY, TO SHOW OFF, YOU KNOW, WONDERFUL THINGS WE COULD COME UP WITH. YOU KNOW, WE KNOW EACH OTHER A LONG TIME. IF YOU WANT TO BORROW IT, YOU'RE WELCOME. I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THAT. I WILL BE SO CAREFUL WITH THIS THING. JUST TAKE CARE OF IT. I PROMISE. ONE PIECE IS COMING BACK IN. THERE WILL NOT BE A NICK ON IT. THANK YOU, STEVE. THAT IS VERY KIND OF YOU. MY PLEASURE. THIS YEAR, WE'RE PLANNING A HOLIDAY DINNER WITH SOME OF OUR OBSCURA FRIENDS. SINCE WE ALL LIKE TO COLLECT WEIRD STUFF AND WE LOVE TALKING ABOUT THEM EVEN MORE, WE THOUGHT EVERYONE COULD BRING SOMETHING INTERESTING ALONG FOR SHOW AND TELL. SO, I'M PAYING A VISIT TO SOME DEALERS I KNOW WHO HAVE A WHOLE WAREHOUSE FULL OF COOL STUFF, AND I HOPE THEY HAVE JUST THE PERFECT ITEM FOR ME TO BRING. HELLO? HELLO. HEY, GUYS. WELCOME. HOLY SMOKES. WE GOT A LITTLE BIT OF EVERYTHING IN HERE. I'LL SAY. THIS IS NUTS. I MEAN, WHEN I SEE YOU SET UP AT BRIMFIELD, YOU ALWAYS HAVE A COUPLE OF BIG THINGS, BUT I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU HAD QUITE SO MANY. I LOVE THE OLD RIDE. KANGAROO? OH, IT'S HIS POUCH. I'M PARTNER IN OBNOXIOUS ANTIQUES. WE LIKE FUN STUFF. WE LIKE STUFF YOU CAN TOUCH AND LAUGH AT AND HAVE FUN WITH, NOT JUST DUST OFF. I'M LOOKING FOR SOMETHING THAT'S GONNA BLOW PEOPLE AWAY. DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING REALLY BIZARRE, MAYBE A LITTLE DISGUSTING? SOMETHING JUST CAME IN. YOU'LL BE THE FIRST ONE TO SEE IT. YEAH? FOLLOW ME. THERE SHE IS. OH, MY GOODNESS! THIS IS ONE OF THE COOLEST FREAK MOUNTS I'VE SEEN. NORMALLY, REALLY SEVERELY DEFORMED ANIMALS DON'T LIVE VERY LONG. THIS THING IS HUGE. I'VE NEVER SEEN AN ADULT SPECIMEN LIKE THAT. IT'S NOT EVEN TOO HEADS. IT'S MORE LIKE IT'S GOT A PARASITIC TWIN. THAT'S REALLY UNUSUAL. PARASITIC TWINS OCCUR WHEN TWIN EMBRYOS IN THE WOMB DON'T FULLY SEPARATE AND ONE BECOMES DOMINANT. THIS SOMETIMES RESULTS IN A STUNTED BODY THAT'S ATTACHED AT THE LOWER ABDOMEN WITH T THE PARASITIC TWIN IS OFTEN BORN WITHOUT A HEART OR A BRAIN AND IS COMPLETELY DEPENDENT ON THE DOMINANT TWIN FOR FOOD, WATER, AND BASIC CARE. WELL, THIS IS ONE OF THE COOLEST TAXIDERMY MOUNTS I'VE EVER SEEN. IT'S PROBABLY A LITTLE BIG FOR A DINNER PARTY. DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING MAYBE SMALLER? WE MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING. OKAY. OH, THAT'S BEAUTIFUL. IT'S A WAX MOULAGE. THESE ARE ACTUALLY MEDICAL MODELS. SPECIFICALLY, THEY WERE VERY GOOD FOR SHOWING OFF DERMATOLOGICAL PROBLEMS. THIS IS SMALLPOX. I LIKE THE LITTLE PUSTULES. YOU NOTICE, LIKE, AROUND THE MOUTH, THEY'RE SORT OF CRUSTY AND YELLOW. I LOVE THAT CRUST. FITS PERFECT. YEAH. THAT'S REALLY GOOD DETAIL. LOOKS LIKE REALLY SEVERE ACNE. REMINDS ME OF HIGH SCHOOL. I LOVE THESE THINGS. YOU DON'T SEE THEM VERY OFTEN 'CAUSE THE WAX IS SO FRAGILE. THE CONDITION'S GREAT. THIS ONE I LIKE A LOT. I THINK THIS WOULD ACTUALLY BE PERFECT FOR A DINNER PARTY. WHAT YOU ASKING ON IT? I COULD GIVE IT TO YOU FOR $250. $250? THAT IS ABSOLUTELY FAIR. I'LL TAKE IT FOR $250. OKAY. THANK YOU. THIS IS THE "ODDITIES HOLIDAY BIZARRE." SO, HOW'D IT GO? YOU GUYS FIND SOME DECENT STUFF, OR... I FOUND SOMETHING COOL, MAN. FOR THIS YEAR'S OBSCURA HOLIDAY PARTY, WE INVITED A BUNCH OF OUR FAVORITE CUSTOMERS OVER FOR DINNER AT OUR FRIEND NICK'S BAR, BUT BEFORE DINNER, WE THOUGHT WE'D DO SOMETHING... WELL, SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND POSSIBLY DISTURBING. MIKE. HEY. PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO ARRIVE. WE'VE ASKED THEM ALL TO BRING A SPECIAL ITEM TO TALK ABOUT FOR SORT OF A SHOW AND TELL OF SORTS. YOU MADE IT. HI, GUYS. WHAT'S UP, DARLING? LOOK WHO IT IS. HIYA, KIDS. HEY, ANDY. YOU BROUGHT YOUR LITTLE FRIEND THERE. WHO'S THAT? THIS IS ANGIE ANIMAL. SO, IS THAT YOUR ITEM FOR THE PARTY?

AWESOME. VERY NICE. BEAUTIFUL. SO, WHAT DID YOU BRING, MIKE? OH. WELL... I GOT A BOMB. WHAT? IT'S A WORLD WAR I MORTAR SHELL. AND WE'VE GOT A BOMB TECH. DEFUSE THE BOMB. UH-HUH. MAKE LOVE, NOT WAR. AMAZING, MIKE. WHO'S NEXT? LADY LAURA. OH. OKAY. THIS IS A VERY LARGE BLADDER STONE. OH! IT'S ALL SOLIDIFIED CALCIUM. I HAVE IT IN PLASTIC BECAUSE THE SCENT IS REALLY AWFUL.

IT'S REALLY BEAUTIFUL WAX WORK. IT HAS REAL EYEBROW. THIS IS SMALLPOX, AND IT HAS REALLY DELICATELY DONE PUSTULES. SOME OF THEM HAVE MORE PUS IN THEM THAN OTHERS. I'M GETTING REAL HUNGRY NOW. THAT'S PRETTY NICE. THAT'S REALLY WELL-DONE. WELL, THANK YOU. ROUND OF APPLAUSE. SO, I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE OF THESE FOR SALE BEFORE. I'VE SEEN THEM IN MUSEUMS, BUT... I'LL LET YOU GUYS BE THE JUDGE.
