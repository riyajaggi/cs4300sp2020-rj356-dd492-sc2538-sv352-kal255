SOMETHING NEW,YOU KNOW, FOR THE NEW PLACE. NEW OLD. YEAH, SOME OLD NEW THING. MM-HMM. I GUESS I WAS SORT OF THINKING, UH, VAGUELY THAT, UM, IT MIGHT BE FUN TO HAVE... MAYBE SET UP A KIND OF LABORATORY. LIKE THAT MAD SCIENTISTS SET UP? YES, A MAD SCIENTIST'S LABORATORY, YES. LIKE SWITCHES AND SPARKY THINGS AND... WELL, I WAS THINKING MORE OF, LIKE, BEAKERS... OH, OKAY. AND RETORTS AND BUNSEN-BURNER KINDS OF THINGS THAT YOU CAN HEAT. BUBBLING. - BUBBLE, YEAH. - MM-HMM. YOU COULD, YOU KNOW, MIX SOME POTIONS IN. WELL, WE DO GET LABORATORY WARE. I MEAN, WE GET OLD BEAKERS AND CONDENSING TUBES AND ERLENMEYER FLASKS AND GRADUATED CYLINDERS, LAB STAND. - WE GET A LOT - OF THE GLASSWARE. MIX SOME THINGS TOGETHER. - SO, WHAT KIND OF BUDGET - ARE YOU LOOKING AT? WELL, UM, I COULD SPEND... I DON'T KNOW. I WAS THINKING OF SPENDING MAYBE $100. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT, WELL, WE ARE GOING TO DO OUR BEST. - GREAT TO SEE YOU. - THANK YOU, MIKE. WE'LL DEFINITELY BE IN TOUCH. THANK YOU, EVAN. BYE. HEY, HOW YOU DOING? HI, THERE. - ANY QUESTIONS, - FEEL FREE TO ASK. OKAY. WELL, HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT ONE HAND, FOUR WINGS, FOUR LEGS, AND TWO TAILS? - IS THIS LIKE A LUNCH ORDER - OR SOMETHING? NO, UH, NOT QUITE. INTERESTED? SURE, SURE. ABSOLUTELY. I HAVE SOMETHING. - I USED TO HAVE IT - ON MY BOOKSHELF, - AND THEN MY MOTHER - CAME TO LIVE WITH ME AND SHE COULDN'T LOOK AT IT, - SO THEN IT WAS UNDER THE SINK - IN THE BATHROOM. NOW, WHAT IS THIS OBJECT WITH ALL THESE LIMBS YOU SPEAK OF? THIS IS DITTO. WOW. DITTO IS A BABY OSTRICH. CAN I SEE IT? YEAH. WOW. THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING. - WHERE ON EARTH - DID YOU GET HIM? I HAD A HATCHERY IN CALIFORNIA ABOUT 12 YEARS AGO. A FREAK-OSTRICH HATCHERY? NO, HE'S JUST ONE THAT DIDN'T HATCH, AND SO I OPENED UP THE EGG TO SEE WHY. - AND I START OPENING - THE SHELL, - AND HERE'S FOUR LEGS - LOOKING AT ME. THERE'S A HEAD, THERE'S FOUR LEGS, THERE'S FOUR WINGS, AND THERE'S TWO TAILS. IS IT ONE BODY OR... - IT'S TWO BODIES - STUCK TOGETHER. THESE OSTRICHES WERE SUPPOSED TO BE IDENTICAL TWINS. - HOWEVER, NATURE DIDN'T FINISH - THE PROCESS. WHEN THE EGG IS GONNA SPLIT INTO TWO IDENTICAL TWINS, IT'S SOMEHOW INTERRUPTED. INSTEAD OF ENDING UP WITH TWO INDIVIDUALS, - YOU GET TWO PARTIALLY TWINNED - INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE STUCK TOGETHER. I DON'T THINK YOU'LL FIND ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE. HE'S PRETTY NEAT. - IT'D BE GREAT TO TAKE ANOTHER, - YOU KNOW, CLOSER LOOK AT HIM. - UM, IF YOU WANT TO TAKE HIM - OUT OF THERE AND TAKE A LOOK AT HIM, YOU'RE WELCOME TO. I DON'T MIND. - THE PROBLEM IS, I TRIED - TO GET HIM OUT, YOU KNOW, - AND IT'S A LOT EASIER - TO GET SOMETHING IN A JAR - THAN OUT OF A JAR. - RIGHT. YOU KNOW WHAT MIGHT WORK? WE ACTUALLY HAVE A SET OF OLD BIRTHING FORCEPS. - OH. - ON THE BOTTOM THERE. NEVER REALLY USED... WELL, NEVER USED THEM AT ALL, - BUT NEVER USED THEM IN THIS WAY, - BUT I WAS THINKING... OH, YEAH, I'VE HAD CHILDREN. - I KNOW ABOUT THESE. - YEAH, YEAH. - LET'S GO TAKE A LOOK - AT THIS THING. - ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO. - OKAY. YEP, THAT'S IT. THAT'S DISGUSTING. - WE'RE LOOKING - FOR SHOWY STUFF. - YOU KNOW, LIKE, - "STEP INTO MY LABORATORY." THERE ARE ITEMS HERE FROM ALL SEVEN CONTINENTS. - WOULD ANY OF THIS - BE FOR SALE? NOT REALLY. RIGHT. Mike: THIS IS "ODDITIES." THIS IS DITTO. WOW. A WOMAN WAS HERE AT THE SHOP WITH A PICKLED BABY OSTRICH OR OSTRICHES. SHE SAID IT'S A VERY RARE CONJOINED TWIN. - BUT THE THING IS, I CAN'T REALLY - SEE WHAT'S GOING ON IN THERE, - SO SHE'S AGREED TO ALLOW ME TO - REMOVE THE OSTRICH FROM THE JAR WITH A PAIR OF BIRTHING FORCEPS. THERE. ALL RIGHT, DOCTOR. - HERE WE GO. - OKAY. YEP, THAT'S IT. THAT'S DISGUSTING. ALL RIGHT. HERE. EXCUSE ME, LITTLE FELLA. YOU GET HIS HEAD UP FIRST. ALL RIGHT. I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S GONNA COME OUT THAT WAY. YEAH, I THINK WE'RE A BREECH BIRTH HERE. I THINK YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TURN HIM A LITTLE. - I SEE WHY THEY DON'T USE - THESE ON KIDS ANYMORE. - MAYBE IF WE GOT - SOME OF THE FLUID OUT, - MIGHT BE EASIER - TO GRAB HIM. THAT MIGHT WORK. AW, THAT STINKS. HE'S BALLED UP IN THERE. YEAH. NOW, BREATHE, PUSH. I MIGHT BE ABLE TO SHOW YOU HIS PIECES THROUGH THE GLASS. HOW'S THAT? THAT MIGHT WORK. IF YOU FEEL, HE'S GOT TWO SPINES. - YOU CAN FEEL TWO SPINES - IN THERE. - SO, WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM - HAPPENED... OH, YEAH. - ...RIGHT AFTER THE BRAIN - WAS FORMED. IT SPLIT THE TWO SPINES, WHICH CAUSED THE TWO BODIES. WOW. THIS IS REALLY A GREAT, GREAT PIECE. WHAT ARE YOU ASKING ON THIS THING? I DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA. - YOU'RE NOT GONNA FIND - ANOTHER ONE. NO. WOULD YOU DO LIKE... $400 ON HIM OR... ARE YOU GONNA LET ME KNOW WHERE HE GOES? HE'LL SEND POSTCARDS AND... OKAY. CALL HOME ONCE A YEAR. - THAT WORK FOR YOU? - YEAH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ALL RIGHT. - NOW WHAT DO I DO - WITH THIS GUY? EVAN AND I ARE ON THE HUNT, LOOKING FOR SOME MAD-SCIENTIST LABORATORY PIECES FOR ONE OF OUR FAVORITE CUSTOMERS...

Evan: THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE. WE GET A LOT OF STUFF, BUT THIS IS BEYOND ANYTHING I IMAGINED. AND THE SMELL IS FANTASTIC. - WE WORK HARD - ON THE SMELL. I'M GARY CALANDRA. I'M A PHYSICIAN, PRESENTLY RETIRED. I BOUGHT ONE SMALL PIECE, AND THINGS SORT OF MUSHROOMED FROM THERE. ULTIMATELY, YEARS LATER, HAD TO BUILD ANOTHER HOUSE IN ORDER TO KEEP THINGS OUT OF THE LIVING ROOM. SO, HOW LONG YOU BEEN COLLECTING THIS STUFF? MUST BE DECADES. PROBABLY SINCE THE MIDDLE '70s. INCREDIBLE. THERE ARE ITEMS HERE FROM ALL SEVEN CONTINENTS. THIS IS THE CABINET WITH THE VACCINES, INCLUDING SMALLPOX. - NOW, THAT'S BEEN COMPLETELY - ERADICATED. - OH, YES. - YEAH.

THERE ARE A FEW PIECES THAT ARE IN HERE - BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE - A PLACE TO GO. OH, YEAH. THAT'S CRAZY. WHAT BRINGS YOU INTO OBSCURA TODAY? YOU MIGHT HAVE SOME, WHAT'S THAT? UH... Mike: THIS IS "ODDITIES." IN OUR HUNT TO FIND LABORATORY ITEMS FOR EDGAR, EVAN AND I ARE IN PENNSYLVANIA VISITING GARY. HE HAS A HUGE COLLECTION OF ANTIQUE PHARMACEUTICAL AND MEDICAL ITEMS, - BUT HE'S NOT REALLY WILLING - TO PART WITH THEM. - LUCKILY, HE DOES HAVE - SOME STUFF IN STORAGE THAT HE IS WILLING TO LET GO. - HOPEFULLY, WE CAN FIND - SOME GREAT STUFF FOR EDGAR - AND SOME REALLY GOOD STUFF - FOR THE SHOP, AS WELL. AH, SO, THIS IS THE STOREROOM. YEP. IGNORE THE MESS, PLEASE. - OH, THIS IS FINE. - IT'S VERY NEAT. WE'VE SEEN SOME REALLY CRAZY, CRAZY BASEMENTS. THERE'S SOME CHEMICAL THINGS OVER HERE. CHEMISTRY GENRE. - Evan: - YEAH, THAT WOULD BE GREAT. - OH, WOW. - LOOK AT THAT THING. OH, THAT LOOKS LIKE A HUGE TEST-TUBE SET. MIND IF I TAKE A LOOK? DON'T BREAK IT. OH, GEEZ. YOU BREAK IT, YOU BOUGHT IT. THAT'S A LARGE TEST TUBE YOU HAVE THERE, SIR. WOW. - RIGHT, IT'S LIKE - A TESTING KIT. - OR MAYBE EVEN - FOR COLLECTING SAMPLES. THAT WOULD BE LOGICAL. WELL, YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES YOU BUY SOMETHING - 'CAUSE YOU DON'T - KNOW WHAT IT IS. IT HAS THE LOOK. WHAT ARE YOU ASKING FOR THIS? WELL, I HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THAT JUST A BIT. - SO, MAYBE WE'LL PUT TOGETHER - A BUNCH OF IT AND GET A GROUP PRICE. YES. THERE'S A COUPLE OF BUNSEN BURNERS. SURE, THOSE ARE USEFUL. THIS, YOU'RE GONNA NEED. A HAND-BLOWN PERCOLATOR. OH, YEAH, A LITTLE CHIPPY, BUT NOT BAD. - YEAH, I THINK WE'LL PUT - THIS ASIDE, TOO. WITH THE BUBBLES COMING OUT, IT'LL BE VERY DRAMATIC. YOU NEED A STAND. OH, SURE. - DO YOU HAVE ANY OF THE RINGS - OR THE CLAMPS? - WE HAVE A COUPLE. - THERE WE GO. I MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING THAT FITS IN HERE THAT WOULD BE IN THE CHEMISTRY GENRE. YEAH, THAT WOULD BE GREAT. OH, YEAH. THAT'S GORGEOUS. THIS IS THE COW. I CALL THOSE UDDER, YEAH. AND THAT'S A NICE OLD ONE. IT HAS THE GROUND... THIS ONE IS JUST BEAUTIFUL GLASSBLOWING. YEAH. IF YOU HEAT THIS, THEN YOU SEPARATE THE GAS FROM THE LIQUID. SO, THEN IT GOES UP HERE. IT'S COOLED AS IT GOES UP. AND, ACTUALLY, THIS IS GROUND, - SO THERE WOULD BE EVEN ANOTHER - PIECE ATTACHED TO THIS. CAN WE ADD THIS TO THE PILE? - OKAY, YOU CAN EVEN HAVE - THE BOX IF YOU WANT. BEFORE WE GO TOO CRAZY HERE, - WHAT KIND OF MONEY - ARE WE LOOKING AT FOR THIS BIG OLD PILE OF STUFF HERE? WELL, LET'S SEE. THAT WOULD BE $300.

HIYA. - HOW YOU DOING? - ALL RIGHT. - LET ME KNOW IF YOU HAVE - ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT ANYTHING. UM, I WAS HOPING THAT MAYBE... UH-HUH? UH, UH, THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE SOME, I DON'T KNOW, BODY PARTS. WHAT'S THAT? H-HANDS CAPABLE OF, UM, BEING ANIMATED OR... LIKE PROSTHETICS? UH-HUH. I'M LOOKING FOR PROPS FOR MOVIES AND STUFF. OH, REALLY? YEAH. I'M... RIGHT NOW SHOOTING A ROBOT MOVIE. I'M SHOPPING AROUND FOR DOLLS AND GIZMOS AND STUFF. YOU WANT TO SEE SOMETHING REALLY, REALLY COOL? YEAH, SURE. THIS IS SOMETHING YOU DO NOT SEE EVERY DAY. UH-HUH. THIS IS A DR. AUZOUX ANATOMICAL MODEL. HMM. - THIS ONE IS FROM - AROUND THE 1920s. THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL. ALL THE ORGANS ARE PRESENT. AND WITH EACH ORGAN, YOU CAN ACTUALLY TAKE IT APART AND DISSECT IT AND LOOK AT WHAT MAKES UP THAT PARTICULAR PIECE. WHEN FRENCH PHYSICIAN LOUIS AUZOUX WAS IN MED SCHOOL, HE FOUND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO DISSECT CADAVERS - BECAUSE OF - THEIR RAPID DECOMPOSITION. HE CAME UP WITH AN ANATOMICALLY CORRECT PAPIER-MâCHé MODEL. NOW, THE PROBLEM WITH PAPER IS IT ALSO DETERIORATES OVER A PERIOD OF YEARS BECAUSE IT DRIES OUT, - SO A LOT OF THESE MODELS - DIDN'T MAKE IT. EVERYTHING IS EXTREMELY DETAILED. - THEY'RE VERY, VERY RARE - AND COLLECTIBLE. I THINK I'VE SEEN ABOUT THREE OF THESE IN MY LIFE. YEAH, THAT'S A BEAUTY. WE HAVE $40,000 ON THIS ONE. A LITTLE OUT OF YOUR... OUT OF YOUR LEAGUE? YEAH. FAIR ENOUGH. - UNLESS YOU COULD BUY IT - ORGAN BY ORGAN, OVER A PERIOD OF YEARS... SINGLE-ORGAN PLAN. I'M WORKING ON A 1/6 FOREGROUND SCALE. OKAY. SO, WHICH IS... YOU KNOW, HUMANS ARE ABOUT 4 FOOT HIGH. SO I WAS LOOKING FOR STUFF THAT SCALE. I WANT TO DO A BATTLEFIELD. ROBOTS ARE CHARGING OVER A BATTLEFIELD. CLOSE-UPS OF A ROBOTIC HAND SHOOTING RAY GUNS. FIVE DEEP AND ROBOT DEAD. WE COME ACROSS THAT STUFF PRETTY FREQUENTLY. WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF IT IN THE STORE NOW. THERE'S ACTUALLY A LOT OF DOLL PARTS AND PROSTHETICS AND JUST WEIRD ODDS AND ENDS DOWN IN THE BASEMENT - THAT I COULD SORT THROUGH, - SO... MM-HMM. - WELL, LISTEN, LEAVE - YOUR NUMBER WITH ME. AND I'LL GIVE YOU A CALL WHEN I GO THROUGH THE STUFF, AND YOU CAN LOOK THROUGH IT. OKAY, YEAH. UH-HUH. Mike: THIS IS "ODDITIES." A FEW DAYS AGO, - A GUY CAME IN - LOOKING FOR SOME SMALL ROBOTS - AND OTHER TYPES OF PROPS - FOR HIS MOVIES. - I WENT DOWN TO THE BASEMENT - AND LOOKED AROUND, AND I DIDN'T FIND ANY ROBOTS, - BUT I DID FIND SOME - OLD DOLLS AND A PROSTHETIC - THAT I THINK MIGHT BE ABLE - TO WORK FOR HIM. - HEY, MIKE. - HOW ARE YOU? HIYA. WOW. COME ON IN. WHAT THE HELL DO YOU HAVE GOING ON IN HERE? OH, MY GOSH. WOW. - HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN - COLLECTING THIS STUFF? THIS MIGHT BE THE CRAZIEST COLLECTION I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE. HMM. WE HAVE AVALANCHES ONCE IN A WHILE. HOLY... YOU KNOW, I'VE BECOME KIND OF A... A HOARDER. - SO, LET ME JUST GET - THIS STRAIGHT. - THESE ROBOTS - DO DIFFERENT SCENARIOS? - MM-HMM. - WHAT HAPPENS? - I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW - YOUR MOVIES. WE JUST SHOOT ON A LITTLE 3x4-FOOT STAGE. IS IT, LIKE, A LIVE-ACTION KIND OF THING, STOP-MOTION? NO, NO, IT'S ALL STOP-MOTION. OH, OKAY. AND I JUST MAKE UP STUFF AS I GO ALONG. WHAT KIND OF MOVIES? OH, IT'S BEEN MOSTLY A SEX MOVIE UP TO NOW. WITH THE ROBOTS? I AM NOTICING, YOU'VE MADE THESE VERY ANATOMICALLY CORRECT. AND THEY'RE NOT WEARING ANY CLOTHES. WELL, ROBOTS ACTUALLY DON'T NEED CLOTHES. - I THOUGHT I'D SEEN EVERYTHING - HERE AT OBSCURA, - BUT I GUESS YOU - LEARN SOMETHING NEW EVERY DAY. - I WENT THROUGH - SOME OF THE STUFF - THAT WE HAD DOWN - IN THE BASEMENT. I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S YOUR FORTE, BUT WHO KNOWS. UM, EW. OH, RAGGEDY ANDY'S BONELESS SISTER. YEAH, EXACTLY. - AND THEN - I GOT THIS LITTLE GUY. OH. - IT'S FUNNY, - THE HEAD COMES RIGHT OFF, SO YOU COULD ADD A ROBOT HEAD OR SOMETHING, RABBIT EARS. MM. - I THINK YOU'RE GONNA LIKE - THIS PROSTHETIC. HMM. CHECK THAT OUT. WOW. - I LOVE THAT - THIS PART IS EXPOSED - AND THERE USED TO BE - A PLATE THERE. GREAT TO SEE THAT. LOOKS VERY ROBOTIC IN THERE. ABSOLUTELY. - IMAGINE DOING A CLOSE-UP - HOLDING A RAY GUN. - RIGHT. - I MEAN, IT'S PERFECT. ACTUALLY, I GOT... I GOT RIGHT... - OH, NO KIDDING? - RAY GUNS. THIS IS GREAT. - IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE - THAT YOU LIKED IN THE GROUP? THAT LITTLE BUNNY THING. I THINK WE HAD $75 ON THIS AND THEN $250 ON THAT GUY. $325 FOR BOTH PIECES. MM-HMM, MM-HMM. THAT'S EXPENSIVE. YOU KNOW, CONSIDERING YOU GET RID OF BOTH OF THEM, MAYBE YOU COULD SLIDE A LITTLE. UH, YEAH, I COULD DO $300. HMM. - AWESOME. - WE HAVE A DEAL, THEN? GREAT. MM. WE'VE BEEN ON THE HUNT FOR ANTIQUE LABORATORY EQUIPMENT FOR ONE OF OUR FAVORITE CUSTOMERS... EDGAR. - WE SPENT A LITTLE MORE - THAN WE EXPECTED. HOWEVER, WE HAVE A PLAN AND A LITTLE SURPRISE FOR HIM.

THAT'S GORGEOUS. - MAY I SIT IN THE CHAIR - WITHIN A CHAIR? YES, YES. - YEAH, THAT'S... - THAT'S VERY COMFORTABLE. WHERE DID YOU FIND THAT? WE FOUND IT IN THE STREET. OH, YOU LITERALLY FOUND IT. YEAH. OH, THAT'S A NICE OLD PIECE. - TOO BAD YOU DON'T HAVE - A PAIR OF THEM. - THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN - EVEN MORE WONDERFUL. TWO CHAIRS IN CHAIRS. - SO, DO YOU WANT TO CHECK OUT - THE GLASSWARE - OR SEE WHAT WE FOUND? - YES. YEAH, LET'S GO LOOK AT IT. - SET UP YOUR LABORATORY. - I'M VERY CURIOUS. OH, MY. LET'S SHOW YOU WHAT WE FOUND. - WE ACTUALLY DID - A LOT OF SHOPPING. - WE ACTUALLY BOUGHT - QUITE A BIT OF STUFF. - SO WE'LL LAY OUT - EVERYTHING WE FOUND, AND YOU COULD PICK THE PIECES YOU LIKE. - AND THEN WE'LL WORK - WITHIN YOUR BUDGET. WHATEVER YOU DON'T WANT, WE'LL JUST SELL AT THE SHOP. THIS IS VERY EXCITING. - OF COURSE, - THE LABORATORY STAND. I REMEMBER THAT FROM... FROM SCHOOL. A NICE SIZE. WE ALSO FOUND YOU SOME WONDERFUL BUNSEN BURNERS. OH, WOW. IF YOU'D LIKE TO PLACE THOSE THERE. SO, DOES THIS HAVE FUEL IN IT? - THESE TWO BURNERS WOULD - ACTUALLY BE HOOKED UP TO A GAS SOURCE. - YOU PROBABLY CAN'T HOOK IT UP - IN YOUR HOUSE, BUT THE LOOK IS WONDERFUL. NOW, THIS... I CALL IT THE UDDER. OH, MY, IT JUST... YOU KNOW, YOU COULD PUT IT RIGHT THERE. IT LOOKS KIND OF LIKE A HAT. YES. NOW, THIS IS WHAT YOU HAD ASKED FOR AT THE SHOP. YES, A RETORT. THEY CALL IT A RETORT OR AN ALEMBIC. - OR A PELICAN, - SOMETIMES I'VE HEARD IT. WOW. IT'S... IT'S BEAUTIFUL. IT SAYS "13" ON IT. THE LUCKIEST ONE. THAT'S MY LUCKY NUMBER. - SO, EDGAR, - WHAT DO YOU THINK? IS THIS WHAT YOU HAD IN MIND? YES. IT'S... IT'S BEAUTIFUL. MY IMAGINING IS MATERIALIZING, YOU KNOW?

THEY MAKE NICE BUD VASES. WHEN YOU'RE NOT USING IT, JUST PUT FLOWERS IN IT. I LOVE THIS BUNSEN BURNER. I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THAT, POSSIBLY. SO, YOU'RE LOOKING AT $90, $100, $110. I'M TRYING... $130 FOR THIS SETUP. - YOUR BUDGET WAS, WHAT, - ABOUT $100 ON THIS? YEAH. BEING THAT YOU'RE BUYING ALL OF IT AS A PACKAGE, WE COULD PROBABLY... WE COULD DO ABOUT $100 ON IT. WELL, GOODY. THANK YOU. ABSOLUTELY. EDGAR, WE ALSO HAVE SOMETHING ELSE. WE OWE YOU A HOUSEWARMING GIFT FOR YOUR NEW PLACE. WE FIGURED, "WHAT EVIL LABORATORY WOULD BE COMPLETE... WITHOUT... WITHOUT A FROG?" IS IT REAL? IT IS A REAL ONE. TAXIDERMIED ONE. IT'S ACTUALLY A PRINCE. YES. AH! WE'VE GOT A DEAL. AWW. I LOVE MY BEAUTIFUL LITTLE LABORATORY. THE FROG SEEMS SO ALIVE.
