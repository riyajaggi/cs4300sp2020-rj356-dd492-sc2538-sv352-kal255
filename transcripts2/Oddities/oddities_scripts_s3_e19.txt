 OKAY. I GOT SOMETHING SCARY. OH, WOW! IT'S PRETTY HORRIBLE STUFF. OBSCURA AIN'T YOUR GRANDMOTHER'S ANTIQUE SHOP. WHOA! WELL, UNLESS YOUR GRANDMA'S A BIT OF A KOOK. IS THAT A STRAITJACKET? I'M MIKE. AND I'M EVAN. Both: WE'VE SPENT OUR ENTIRE LIVES... COLLECTING AND DEALING... HUNTING AND PICKING... TO GET THIS BUSINESS... DOWN TO A SCIENCE. THIS IS "ODDITIES."

 HELLO. HEY. HOW YOU DOING? LET ME KNOW IF YOU NEED ANYTHING. SURE. AN ACQUAINTANCE OF MINE PASSED AWAY, AND I ODDLY ENOUGH INHERITED THE CONTENTS OF HIS STORAGE SPACE. AND THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS IN IT. I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT THE HELL IT IS. PERHAPS I SHOULD UNRAVEL IT. PLEASE DO. ALL RIGHT. HMM. I HAVE ONE OF THESE. I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA WHAT THIS THING IS. YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW I FELT WHEN I INHERITED THIS THING. Baron: MY NAME IS BARON MISURACA. I HAVE A VERY STRANGE ITEM HERE I'M LOOKING TO FIND OUT A LITTLE BIT ABOUT, SEE WHAT IT'S WORTH. THIS ALMOST LOOKS LIKE IT GOES ON YOUR HEAD. BUT THEN AGAIN, IT'S 15 POUNDS. YEAH. SO MAYBE IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS MEANT TO PUT ON SOMEONE'S HEAD THAT THEY DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE PUT ON THEIR HEAD. I'M LEANING TOWARDS TORTURE DEVICE AT THIS POINT, TO BE HONEST. YEAH, IT DOES HAVE A TORTURE VIBE TO IT FOR SURE. I WOULDN'T WANT THAT TO GO ON MY HEAD. ME, EITHER. I WANT TO KEEP MY HAIR LOOKING GOOD. YEAH, YOU HAVE REALLY LONG HAIR, MAN. IT'S BEEN 25 YEARS SINCE I GOT A HAIRCUT. I HATE THOSE HAIRCUTTING PLACES. LET'S PUT IT THAT WAY. IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S SOME KIND OF MAKER'S MARK HERE. IT'S REALLY FAINT, THOUGH. YEAH. YEAH. HERE, COULD YOU ACTUALLY HOLD THAT FOR A LITTLE BIT? I WANTED TO SEE WHAT THESE THINGS SAID. OF COURSE. IT LOOKS LIKE THIS WAS PATENTED, BUT IT COULD POSSIBLY JUST BE FOR THIS PIECE. BUT THIS DOES SAY "MECO-SAZH." MAYBE IT WAS A MILITARY PIECE OR SOMETHING? YEAH, I MEAN, I REALLY DO LIKE IT. IT'S JUST BIZARRE-LOOKING. THERE'S SOMETHING RATHER SADISTIC ABOUT THE LOOK OF THIS. VERY MUCH SO. HOWEVER, I JUST DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT IT. IF IT IS MEDICAL, IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'D DEFINITELY BE INTERESTED IN. SO THERE'S A GUY THAT I COULD PROBABLY PUT A CALL IN TO WHO DEALS WITH SCIENTIFIC AND MORE MECHANICAL STUFF. I COULD GIVE HIM A CALL AND SEE WHAT HE SAYS AND HAVE YOU COME BACK. THANKS, MAN. ALL RIGHTY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. SEE YOU LATER. HELLO. HI. HOW ARE YOU? GOOD. ANY QUESTIONS... FEEL FREE TO ASK. I'M ACTUALLY LOOKING FOR SOME BIRD PARTS. WHAT KIND OF PARTS EXACTLY ARE YOU LOOKING FOR? I DON'T KNOW... SKELETAL PARTS OR FEATHERS OR AN ACTUAL STUDY SKIN OF A BIRD. I'M SIGRID. I'M HERE TO PICK UP SOME LITTLE ODD THINGS TO PUT IN MY INSTALLATIONS. I DO WAX WORKS, AND I LIKE TO INCORPORATE MANY DIFFERENT OBJECTS WITHIN THE PIECES THAT I MAKE. ANY SPECIFIC KIND OF BIRD? MAYBE A SCAVENGER OR A BIRD OF PREY? WE DO HAVE ONE SKULL IN THE CASE HERE, IF YOU WANT TO SEE IT. OH, I'D LOVE TO SEE IT. ABSOLUTELY. THIS THING. THIS THING JUST CAME IN. IT'S ACTUALLY AN AFRICAN VULTURE, WHICH, YOU KNOW, IS A SCAVENGER. AND ALSO, THIS BIRD IN AFRICA... IT'S NOT ENDANGERED. THEIR NUMBERS ARE VERY STRONG. THEY'RE NOT REGULATED IN ANY WAY. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT. YOU KNOW, A VULTURE SYMBOLIZES EXACTLY WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR. SO WHY THE SCAVENGER HEAD? IT'S PART OF A HEADDRESS FOR A LIFE-SIZE WAX FIGURE OF A DEBAUCHED QUEEN. MAKES SENSE. YEAH, DOESN'T IT, THOUGH? I REFUSE TO LET GO OF THIS. I'M PETTING IT. HOW MUCH YOU ASKING? WE'RE ASKING $200 FOR THAT PARTICULAR SKULL. THAT'S FINE. YEAH. THAT'S PERFECTLY FINE. OH! I'M ALSO LOOKING FOR SOMETHING ELSE. YOU MUST COME ACROSS THEM ONCE IN A WHILE. I'M LOOKING FOR A DEATH MASK. DOES THAT HAVE TO BE A DEBAUCHED QUEEN'S DEATH MASK, OR IS THAT... NO, IT'S OKAY. BEFORE THE ADVENT OF PHOTOGRAPHY, POETS, AND PHILOSOPHERS WERE USED TO MAKE SCULPTED PORTRAITS ALL THE WAY BACK TO ANCIENT EGYPT. AND BEFORE THE WIDESPREAD USE OF EMBALMING AND REFRIGERATION, CASTS WERE USED SO THAT LOVED ONES COULD IDENTIFY A MISSING PERSON. I'M WORKING ON SOME PIECES ABOUT DEATH. I'M INTERESTED IN SEEING OTHER WORKS, YOU KNOW, FOR A REFERENCE, 'CAUSE I'M NOT CASTING OFF OF A DEAD PERSON. I CAST OFF OF LIVE PEOPLE. I GUESS YOU CAN'T REALLY DO A LIVE CAST AND SAY, "ACT DEAD." THERE'S A LACK OF ESSENCE IN A DEATH MASK. THE EYES ARE MORE HOLLOWED-OUT. THE CHEEKS SEEM TO BE MORE SUNKEN. THEY JUST LACK ANIMATION. SO WHAT KIND OF BUDGET ARE YOU LOOKING FOR FOR THIS DEATH MASK? I'M LOOKING BETWEEN $700 AND $900. THEY'RE PRETTY HARD TO FIND, OR THEY'RE GLUED TOGETHER. RIGHT. THEY'RE KIND OF STRANGE. THEY AGE. THEY TURN COLOR. SO ACTUALLY, IT'S SOMETHING WE DON'T HAVE VERY OFTEN. BUT WE KNOW SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY COLLECTS MASKS. HE MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING. WOULD YOU BE KIND ENOUGH TO ASK HIM? OKAY, SO $200 FOR THAT, AND WE'LL FIND YOU A DEATH MASK. FANTASTIC. YOU GOT A DEAL. OH, ABSOLUTELY. IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A DEATH MASK, RIGHT OVER HERE. A DEATH MASK OF A TWO-HEADED BABY. OH, THAT'S PROBABLY A LITTLE TOO MUCH INSPIRATION. OKAY. Mike: THIS IS "ODDITIES." THE OTHER DAY, A CUSTOMER CAME INTO THE SHOP WITH A CRAZY, SADISTIC-LOOKING DEVICE, BUT I THINK IT WOULD FIT IN WITH THE AESTHETIC OF OBSCURA. SO I CALLED UP A COLLECTOR FRIEND OF THE SHOP'S WHO DEALS WITH THIS KIND OF STUFF TO SEE IF MAYBE HE KNOWS WHAT IT IS AND WHAT IT MIGHT BE WORTH. HEY. HOW'S IT GOING, MAN? GOOD. I HAVE RETURNED. THIS IS MY FRIEND STEVE I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT. PLEASURE. Steve: I'M STEVE ARENBURG. I SPECIALIZE IN MEDICAL... SCIENTIFIC CONTRAPTIONS, MEDICAL DEVICES... ALL SORTS OF ODDBALL ITEMS. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS? DO YOU MIND? DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE HECK IT IS? I DO. IT'S A POWER TOOL FOR YOUR HEAD. BUT IT'S ACTUALLY A MECO-SAZH, AND IT'S A VERY PLEASANT DEVICE. IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT'S VERY PLEASANT. NO, IT'S A BALDNESS CURE. YOU WOULD PUT IT ON THE HEAD, PLUG IT IN, AND TURN IT ON. ISN'T IT KIND OF HEAVY FOR... IT IS. SOME OF THESE HAD LOOPS ON THE TOP THAT THEY WOULD HANG FROM THE CEILING. A BARBER WOULD CHARGE FOR IT. SHOULD WE JUST TRY TO PLUG IT IN? LET'S DO IT. OKAY. I'M DEFINITELY NOT TRYING IT, THOUGHT. YOU WANT TO TRY IT, STEVE? SURE. I'LL TRY "SLOW." IT SEEMS LIKE HE LIKES IT. YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT THAT BAD. WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH HAIR, STEVE. I'M WAITING FOR IT TO GROW. I THINK I CAN FEEL IT... OH, LOOK! SEE, IT GROWS UPWARD. YOU'VE DEALT WITH THESE IN THE PAST. YOU'VE AT LEAST SEEN THEM. I'VE SEEN THREE OF THEM IN 30 YEARS. WHAT DO THEY GENERALLY SELL FOR? ON A GOOD DAY AT AN AUCTION WITH THE RIGHT PEOPLE, IT COULD BE UPWARDS OF $3,000. REALLY? WHEW! THAT'S AMAZING. STEVE, ALWAYS A PLEASURE TO HAVE YOU IN HERE, MAN. I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. THANKS. YEAH, THANK YOU SO MUCH. BYE, NOW. IF I SAW THIS AT A MARKET, AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS, I MIGHT BE WILLING TO SPEND RIGHT AROUND $1,500. $1,500. YEAH, I MEAN, THAT'S REALLY WHERE I FEEL COMFORTABLE. I MEAN, THAT'S DEFINITELY THE LOW END OF IT THERE. I MEAN, YOU COULDN'T DO A LITTLE BIT BETTER? UM... LOOK HOW NICE. IT'S IN SUCH GREAT CONDITION. IT IS IN REALLY GOOD CONDITION. I CAN DO $1,600. $1,600? CAN YOU LIVE WITH THAT? YEAH, YEAH, WHY NOT? ALL RIGHT, COOL. IT'S A BEAUTIFUL THING. THANKS, BARON. ALL RIGHTY. MY PLEASURE. Mike: EARLIER THIS WEEK, A CUSTOMER CAME IN LOOKING FOR A DEATH MASK TO USE AS INSPIRATION FOR THIS LIFE-SIZED WAX MODEL SHE'S MAKING. DEATH MASKS ARE FAIRLY RARE. WE DON'T GET A LOT OF THEM AT THE SHOP. HOWEVER, WE DO HAVE A GOOD FRIEND WITH A VERY LARGE MASK COLLECTION THAT MAY HAVE SOMETHING, IF HE'S WILLING TO SELL IT. COME ON IN! OH! YEAH, THANKS FOR HAVING US OVER. IT'S ALWAYS NICE TO HAVE YOU HERE. ALWAYS NICE TO SEE THE COLLECTION. YOU'RE INTERESTED IN SOME MASKS. YEAH, YEAH! MASKS, I HAVE! Mike D.: I'M MIKE DRAKE. I'VE BEEN COLLECTING MASKS FOR MANY YEARS, SINCE MY MOTHER GAVE ME A WOODEN AFRICAN MASK I GUESS AROUND 35 YEARS AGO. THAT IS QUITE A COLLECTION. THANK YOU. WHAT CAN I GET FOR YOU? I'M NOT LOOKING FOR SO MUCH THE CARVED, CREEPY MASKS. WE'RE LOOKING FOR MORE OF, LIKE, THE CAST HUMAN MASKS. SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE ANATOMICALLY HUMAN. AH! I CAN HELP YOU THERE. LET'S GO THIS WAY. OH, WOW, THAT IS QUITE A COLLECTION! THERE'S HITCHCOCK. YES! THAT'S JOHNNY DEPP. THAT'S JOHNNY DEPP? YEAH, IN "PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN." ACTUALLY, I'M EVEN UP HERE. ARE YOU?! YEAH, OVER THERE AT THE END. THE SILVER ONE ON THE WOOD. OH, VERY NICE. OH, YEAH, LOOK AT THAT. ARE THESE MADE FOR, LIKE, SPECIAL EFFECTS AND MAKEUP, OR DO THE FAMOUS PEOPLE JUST HAVE THEIR MASKS MADE? WHEN YOU NEED TO DO A PROSTHETIC APPLIANCE, THEY'LL MAKE A MOLD OF THE FACE, AND THEN YOU CAN SCULPT ON THERE, RATHER THAN MAKING THE ACTOR SIT IN THE CHAIR FOR HOURS WHILE YOU EXPERIMENT WITH SCULPTING. IN MY CASE, I JUST DID IT FOR THE FUN OF DOING IT. THESE ARE NOT DEATH MASKS, AS THESE PEOPLE... MANY OF THEM ARE STILL ALIVE. NO, NO. JOHNNY'S STILL ALIVE, AS AM I. THESE ARE ALL MOLDED FROM THEIR FACES WHILE THE PEOPLE WERE ALIVE. SO THAT'S NOT HITCHCOCK'S DEATH MASK. NO, IT'S NOT. 'CAUSE IT'S HARD TO TELL WITH HIM. WELL, YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A DEATH MASK, I HAVE SOMETHING PERFECT FOR YOU RIGHT OVER HERE. OOH! THAT'S PRETTY CREEPY. YEAH, THAT IS UNUSUAL. A DEATH MASK OF A TWO-HEADED BABY. THAT'S AMAZING. IS THIS WHAT YOU NEED? YES AND NO. THAT'S CLOSE. I MEAN, IT IS A DEATH MASK. IT'S CREEPY AS ANYTHING. YEAH, THAT'S PROBABLY A LITTLE TOO MUCH INSPIRATION. I THINK SHE WANTS SOMETHING MORE... CLASSICAL. YEAH, TRADITIONAL. OKAY. I THINK I HAVE THE PERFECT THING FOR YOU. OKAY. OVER HERE! L'INCONNUE DE LA SIENE. AH, THE UNKNOWN OF THE SIENE! EXACTLY! I TOOK SPANISH IN HIGH SCHOOL. THE BASIC STORY OF L'INCONNUE DE LA SIENE... I BELIEVE IT WAS AROUND 1880, THIS WOMAN DROWNED, AND WHEN THEY PULLED HER OUT FROM THE RIVER, THEY COULDN'T IDENTIFY HER, SO THEY MADE A CAST OF HER HEAD FOR THE PURPOSE OF IDENTIFYING HER LATER ON. AND IT WAS UNUSUAL BECAUSE SHE WAS SMILING, AND PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT SHE WAS SO BEAUTIFUL AND LOOKED SO SERENE THAT THEY STARTED TO MAKE COPIES OF IT AND THEN JUST HAVE IT IN THEIR HOMES. WHAT'S INTERESTING IS SHE'S BEEN CALLED THE MOST-KISSED WOMAN IN THE WORLD BECAUSE THIS IS THE HEAD THAT THEY USED TO MAKE THE FIRST RESUSCI ANNIE. REALLY? YES! SO IF YOU TOOK A CPR CLASS, THESE ARE THE LIPS YOU KISSED. NOW, WHAT'S ODD ABOUT THAT ONE IS IT HAS ALL THOSE ANATOMICAL MARKINGS. YES, THIS ONE'S PAINTED UP FOR USE BY DOCTORS. I HATE TO ASK YOU, BUT WHAT'S IT GONNA TAKE TO PRY THIS FROM YOUR COLD, DEAD HANDS? I DON'T KNOW. SHE REALLY IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE PIECES. UNDERSTANDABLE. AND SHE'S VERY UNIQUE, AND I KNOW THAT IT'S GONNA BE VERY HARD FOR ME TO REPLACE HER. UH-OH. WHAT WERE YOU THINKING? WOULD YOU CONSIDER $700 FOR THIS PIECE? $700 IS... $700 IS SO, SO LOW, AND SHE'S SO DEAR TO ME. COULD YOU GO $800? I THINK WE'LL TAKE IT. I THINK YOU GOT A DEAL. THANK YOU, MIKE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HERE IS THE DEATH MASK WE GOT FOR YOU. OKAY, LET'S SEE IT. YOU MIGHT RECOGNIZE HER. Mike: THIS IS "ODDITIES." EVAN AND I ARE AT THE HOME OF A COLLECTOR WHO MAKES LIFE-SIZE WAX MODELS. WE'RE HERE TO DELIVER A DEATH MASK WE WERE ABLE TO ACQUIRE FOR HER. WE DID GO A BIT OVER BUDGET, BUT I KNOW ONCE SHE SEES THIS THING OKAY, ARE YOU READY? YEAH. OH, MY GOODNESS! HOLY COW! LOOK AT THIS PLACE. OH, GOSH! WOW, THIS IS ALL YOUR WORK. YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. THIS IS NUTS. THESE ARE ALL CAST OFF OF PEOPLE I KNOW. AMAZING. THEY'RE MY FRIENDS. THEY'RE MY PEER GROUP. NOW, IS THIS HOW YOU ASSEMBLE THEM, OR IS THIS, LIKE, A WHOLE PIECE? WELL, THIS IS PART OF A PIECE CALLED "THE VALLEY OF THE DRY BONES," THE DOWNFALL OF THE ECONOMY. OOH. SO IT'S WAR, IT'S DECLINE, STOCK-MARKET CRASHES. THEY'RE KIND OF ANGUISHED. THEY'RE KIND OF SAD. MOM AND THE KIDS. THESE ARE ALL THE CHILDREN. THESE ARE ALL THE CHILDREN, AND THAT'S MOM. THEY'RE WONDERFULLY FRIGHTENING. I LOVE THAT THEY'RE CLEARLY... THE FACES ARE NOT CHILDLIKE FACES. THEY'RE MATURE FACES, BUT ON THESE LITTLE BODIES. IT'S REALLY QUITE JARRING. THEY'RE QUITE AGED. SO ACTUALLY, HERE IS THE DEATH MASK WE GOT FOR YOU. OKAY, LET'S SEE IT. SHE'S ACTUALLY KIND OF FAMOUS, THIS WOMAN. YOU MIGHT RECOGNIZE HER. IT'S FROM FRANCE. OH, THAT'S FANTASTIC. AND IT'S ACTUALLY A VERY WELL-KNOWN, ALTHOUGH UNKNOWN, DEAD PERSON. WHO IS IT? SHE'S KNOWN AS L'INCONNUE. SHE IS THE UNKNOWN. SHE WAS ACTUALLY A DROWNING VICTIM. SHE DROWNED IN THE SIENE, SO THEY CAST HER DEATH MASK. BASICALLY TO TRY TO IDENTIFY HER INITIALLY. AND ACTUALLY, THIS IS A VERSION OF THAT CAST, BUT AS YOU CAN SEE, IT'S MARKED FOR THE ANATOMICAL DETAIL. DO YOU WANT TO TAKE A LOOK? OH, I'D LOVE TO. THANK YOU. SHE LOOKS SO HAPPY. SHE'S VERY BEAUTIFUL, ISN'T SHE? NOW, I KNOW THAT WE DISCUSSED THE PRICE AT THE SHOP. HOW MUCH ARE YOU ASKING? WE'RE ACTUALLY ASKING $1,200 FOR THIS PIECE. YOU CAN SEE I KEEP FONDLING HER. I'M NOT LETTING HER GO, AM I? THIS IS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT. OH, STOP. I WANT TO MAKE A PROPOSAL. SURE. I'LL TAKE IT FOR YOUR PRICE IF I CAN CAST EVAN AS MY DEBAUCHED QUEEN. YES? OHH! THAT WOULD BE AMAZING. YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY STUNNING, AND I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO DO YOU. YOU'D MAKE AN EXCELLENT DEBAUCHED QUEEN. SHE WOULD, WOULDN'T SHE? SO TRUE TO LIFE. THAT IS JUST THE NICEST OFFER. COMPLIMENT? YES, I MEAN, 'CAUSE I AM OBSESSED WITH THESE WAX MODELS. TO BE ONE WOULD BE JUST THE MOST AMAZING THING EVER. WELL, YOU'RE STUNNING. YOU HAVE A BEAUTIFUL FACE. YOU HAVE BEAUTIFUL HANDS. IT WOULD BE AN HONOR AND A PRIVILEGE TO BE YOUR MODEL. THAT WOULD BE INCREDIBLE. I GUESS WE HAVE A DEAL THEN. WE GOT A DEAL. WE GOT A DEAL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OH, MY GOD. IT'S BEEN A GREAT PLEASURE. I AM REALLY, REALLY EXCITED ABOUT CASTING EVAN. THIS IS GONNA BE FANTASTIC. SHE IS GONNA BE A KILLER MODEL. SHE IS JUST GONNA BE... I CANNOT WAIT TO START. IF YOU DO FREAK, JUST LET ME KNOW. DO YOU HAVE, LIKE, A SAFE WORD, OR A GESTURE OR SOMETHING? GOOD. BAD. GOTCHA. THE BASICS. THE ROMAN... THIS DOES HAVE, SORT OF, A THIRD-WORLD-SURGERY SORT OF FEEL TO IT. WHAT I'M GONNA DO IS I'M GONNA START ON YOUR MOUTH. IT'S GONNA BE COLD. OOH! OH, YEAH. AH, YUCK! IT FEELS LIKE FISH. IT LOOKS LIKE A HORROR MOVIE OR SOMETHING. ALL RIGHT, I'M GONNA DO YOUR MOUTH, MOUTH, MOUTH, MOUTH. I'M BEING LOCKED IN. CLOSE THAT MOUTH. OOPS. I GOT TO DO YOUR EYES. OH, THAT IS SO STRANGE. CAN YOU BREATHE OKAY? I'M GONNA START PUTTING THE COTTON ON. THUMBS UP. SO FAR SO GOOD. SO IS COTTON USED TO REINFORCE THE ALGINATE? NO, SO THE PLASTER CAN ADHERE TO IT. OKAY, I THINK THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH. OKAY, SWEETHEART, WE'RE GONNA START PUTTING PLASTER BANDAGES ON YOU. SO THIS IS THE SAME KIND OF MATERIAL THEY WOULD MAKE A PLASTER CAST FROM... LIKE, FOR YOUR ARM OR LEG? THIS IS A LITTLE BIT MORE FLEXIBLE. SO IT'S BASICALLY LIKE GAUZE WITH PLASTER. IMPREGNATED WITH PLASTER. RIGHT. OKAY, SWEETHEART, YOU'RE DONE. PUT YOUR HANDS ON THE MASK. OKAY. START WIGGLING. CAN YOU BEND FORWARD A LITTLE BIT? GREAT. START WIGGLING. HOLD THE MASK. KEEP WIGGLING. I'M GONNA JUST TAKE IT OFF. OH, MY GOD, IT'S FANTASTIC. OHH. ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS. HOLD ON. LET'S GIVE HER A PAPER TOWEL, PLEASE. I AM, LIKE... I AM VERY LIGHT-HEADED. OH, MY GOD. LOOK AT THAT! ISN'T THAT FANTASTIC? IT LOOKS LIKE EVAN. OHH. WHEN I WOKE UP THIS MORNING, I DID NOT EXPECT TO HAVE MY FACE COVERED IN ALGINATE AND PLASTER TO MAKE A LIFE MASK. I CANNOT WAIT TO SEE WHAT THIS DEBAUCHED QUEEN MODEL FINALLY LOOKS LIKE. OH, WELL, THANK YOU SO MUCH. IT'S BEEN A GREAT PLEASURE. THIS HAS BEEN AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE. I WANT TO GIVE YOU A HUG. THANK YOU. HOW YOU DOING? ANY QUESTIONS... FEEL FREE TO ASK. THANKS. ANYTHING YOU'RE LOOKING FOR, OR...? NO, ACTUALLY, I THINK I MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU. DO YOU GUYS BUY ANY SPECIFIC TIME PERIOD? THE OLDER, THE BETTER. YEAH. AND THE SCARIER, THE BETTER, OF COURSE. I GOT SOMETHING SCARY. GOT IT WITH YOU? YEAH. I'M COWBOY MARK. I'M A DEEJAY AND ANTIQUES COLLECTOR AND RESELLER. I THINK I HAVE A PRETTY UNIQUE PIECE THAT MIKE WOULD BE INTERESTED IN. IT'S PRETTY COOL. IS THERE ANYTHING IN THERE? YEAH. OH, WOW! THAT'S PRETTY HORRIBLE STUFF. THIS IS "ODDITIES." I GOT SOMETHING SCARY. GOT IT WITH YOU? YEAH. WHAT IS THAT... A DISSECTING KIT OR SOMETHING? NO, NO. OH, WOW. AN OLD NAVY VENEREAL TREATMENT KIT. THAT'S RIGHT. MAN! THAT'S PRETTY SWEET! THIS, OF COURSE, WAS USED, PROBABLY, FOR ANY SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASE... YOU KNOW, SYPHILIS, GONORRHEA, BASICALLY WHATEVER YOU HAVE, THEY WOULD PROBABLY USE A KIT LIKE THIS TO TRY TO TREAT IT. SYPHILIS AND GONORRHEA ARE FAIRLY EASILY CONTROLLED THESE DAYS WITH ANTIBIOTICS, HOWEVER, WITH THESE OLD KITS, THERE WAS A LOT OF CUTTING AND SCRAPING GOING ON. IT'S PRETTY HORRIBLE STUFF. IF LEFT UNTREATED, I MEAN, THESE DISEASED COULD LEAD TO HEART PROBLEMS, MENINGITIS, AND EVEN DEATH. LOOK AT THAT. THAT'S THE ASPIRATING NEEDLE. THAT'S A PRETTY HORRIBLE PROBE. THIS WOULD BE, WELL, STUCK INTO ALL SORTS OF PLACES. IT SOUNDS PAINFUL. OH, YEAH! THE THING ABOUT THE OLD NEEDLES ARE THEY WEREN'T DISPOSABLE. THESE WOULD BE USED OVER AND OVER AGAIN. NOW, THAT'S A DOUBLE-END CURETTE. TO SCRAPE, AND IF YOU FEEL, ON THE EDGE THERE. IT'S SORT OF LIKE A MELON BALLER. WAS THIS STUFF WASHED BY ANY CHANCE? THE MORE I LOOK AT IT, THE MORE I THINK OF WHAT I'M HOLDING. I'M LIKE, "I REALLY HOPE THIS STUFF'S BEEN CLEANED." YEAH. IT'S A REALLY NICE PIECE. WHAT KIND OF MONEY ARE YOU ASKING? I WAS THINKING $150. I'D PROBABLY BE MORE COMFORTABLE AROUND $100. IS THERE ANY WAY YOU COULD GET CLOSER TO THAT NUMBER? $115? THAT'S FINE. OKAY. GREAT. EXCELLENT. WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING IT IN. HEY! HEY, EVAN, HOW YOU DOING? SIGRID! GOOD TO SEE YOU? IF YOU'RE HERE... SO IS MY FRIEND. OHH! THE DEBAUCHED QUEEN. OH, MY GOD. I CAN'T WAIT. A LITTLE WHILE AGO, MIKE AND I WENT ON A HUNT FOR A DEATH MASK FOR SIGRID. PART OF THE DEAL ON THE PRICE WAS THAT I WOULD POSE FOR A MODEL OF A DEBAUCHED QUEEN THAT SHE'S MAKING. THIS IS EITHER GONNA BE AMAZING OR TERRIFYING. I'M KEEPING MY FINGERS CROSSED THAT YOU LIKE HER. OKAY. OKAY. GO AHEAD. TAKE A LOOK. OH, MY GOODNESS. READY? I'M GONNA SHUT MY EYES. READY? WHAT DO YOU THINK? IS THAT OKAY? OHH! THAT'S AMAZING! YEAH? LOOK AT HER! THAT LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE ME! OH, MY GOD! SHE'S DEBAUCHED. SHE LOOKS MAD. DOESN'T SHE? THE BLOOD DRIPPING OFF THE LIPS IS NICE. WHAT DID I EAT? THE LAMB. OHH. BAA! OHH! AND THAT VULTURE SKULL LOOKS GREAT. THAT REALLY WORKED WELL. SHE HAS INTERESTING TEETH. YOU KNOW WHAT... ONE OF THEM IS MY MOTHER'S ROTTEN TOOTH. YEAH, YEAH. AND THE FRONT TOOTH... THERE'S A ROTTEN FRONT TOOTH IN THERE, TOO. OHH! YEAH, SO IT'S GOT REAL TEETH. IT'S NOT HOW MOST PEOPLE WOULD WANT TO BE DEPICTED, BUT SHE'S COLD AND EVIL. I NOW KNOW WHAT I WOULD HAVE LOOKED LIKE IF I'D BECOME A DEBAUCHED QUEEN AND NOT AN ANTIQUES DEALER. AND I HAVE TO SAY I LIKE IT. OF THE TWO OF YOU TOGETHER? YEAH. I'M REALLY RELIEVED AND REALLY HAPPY THAT EVAN LIKED THE PIECE, AND I CAN'T WAIT TO WORK ON MORE PIECES WITH HER. SHE'S EVIL. THAT IS SO CREEPY. I FEEL LIKE I'M LOOKING AT TWINS. IT'S REALLY, LIKE, SPOOKY.
