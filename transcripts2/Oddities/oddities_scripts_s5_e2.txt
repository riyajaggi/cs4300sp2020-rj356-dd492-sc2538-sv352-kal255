 OH, MY GOD. ARE YOU SERIOUS? OBSCURA AIN'T YOUR GRANDMOTHER'S ANTIQUE SHOP. WHOA! WELL, UNLESS YOUR GRANDMA'S A BIT OF A KOOK. IS THAT A STRAITJACKET? I'M MIKE. AND I'M EVAN. WE'VE SPENT OUR ENTIRE LIVES... COLLECTING AND DEALING... HUNTING AND PICKING... TO GET THIS BUSINESS... DOWN TO A SCIENCE. THIS IS "ODDITIES." OH, HELLO. HI. HOW YOU DOING? GOOD. ASK IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS.

 I HAVE A KIND OF A FASCINATION. UH-HUH. I WAS WONDERING IF YOU HAD ANY SORT OF, UH... OCULAR DEVICES? OH, WOW! YOU SEE, I HAVE AN INTEREST IN THINGS... THE AESTHETIC OF THE EYE. UH-HUH. SO, I HEARD THAT THIS MIGHT BE THE PLACE TO COME TO. MY NAME IS DJ DREAM TRANCER. MY TWO LOVES ARE MUSIC AND EYES. WHEN I WAS YOUNGER, I WOUND UP ALMOST GOING BLIND IN MY RIGHT EYE. THREE MONTHS, I HAD TO WEAR AN EYE PATCH. KIND OF GIVES YOU A WHOLE NEW APPRECIATION FOR EYES AND YOUR SIGHT. ARE THOSE CONTACTS YOU'RE WEARING? THESE ARE CONTACTS. UH-HUH. I ACTUALLY HAVE ABOUT 30 OR 40 DIFFERENT PAIRS. THESE ARE ONE OF MY FAVORITE ONES. 'CAUSE NOW YOU'RE JUST PUPILS, WHICH IS VERY DISCONCERTING. YES, YES. YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY, WE DID GET SOMETHING VERY COOL IN THAT YOU WOULD APPRECIATE. I WAS HOPING SO. YEAH? MIND IF I TAKE A LOOK? I'LL GO GET IT. THIS THING ACTUALLY UPSETS ME JUST A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE I'M VERY SENSITIVE ABOUT MY EYES. BUT YOU MIGHT LOVE IT. WOW. THIS IS ACTUALLY A MID-19th CENTURY PORTABLE EYE SURGEON'S KIT. IT'S EVERYTHING YOU'D NEED TO SORT OF DO TRIAGE ON AN EYE THAT WAS INJURED OR MAYBE EVEN HAD SOME KIND OF INFECTION. THESE JUST LOOK LIKE SEWING SCISSORS. UH-HUH. BUT THESE ARE ACTUALLY IRIS SCISSORS. WOW, VERY... AND, YEAH, THEY, UH THEY WOULD JUST CUT OUT THE, UH... THE DAMAGED PART. THAT IS VERY INTERESTING. DURING THE 19th CENTURY, ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT EYE SURGERIES WAS THE PROCEDURE USED TO RELIEVE GLAUCOMA. GLAUCOMA IS A BUILD-UP OF PRESSURE INSIDE THE EYE WHICH DAMAGES THE OPTIC NERVE, THE VEIN-LIKE STRUCTURE AT THE BACK OF THE EYE THAT CARRIES VISUAL INFORMATION FROM THE BRAIN. WITH INSTRUMENTS LIKE THESE, SURGEONS COULD REMOVE A PORTION OF THE IRIS, THUS RELIEVING PRESSURE IN THE EYE. THIS IS MY FAVORITE PIECE IN THE KIT. IT'S SUCH A BEAUTIFUL THING. IT'S A SPATULA. YOU DON'T FLIP PANCAKES WITH THESE, DO YOU? WELL, YOU DO, KIND OF, 'CAUSE THIS SPATULA... IT'S USED FOR LIFTING THAT FLAT TISSUE IF YOU CUT INTO THE CORNEA. SO THEY PUT IT UNDERNEATH AND GENTLY LIFT IT? YEAH. AND THEN GENTLY PUT IT BACK. OUCH. SO, IS THIS THE KIND OF THING THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR? THIS IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING, ACTUALLY. THIS IS RIGHT UP MY ALLEY. WELL, THE KIT'S ABOUT $250. YES, THIS IS GREAT. YEAH? ALL RIGHT. YOU GOT A DEAL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MY PLEASURE. HEY, HOW YOU DOING? HOW ARE YOU? GOOD. ANY QUESTIONS, FEEL FREE TO ASK. ANYTHING SPECIFIC YOU'RE LOOKING FOR? I HAVE MY EYE ON THIS. WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT THIS, ACTUALLY? THIS IS A JAR FULL OF HUMAN TEETH. THIS CAME FROM A DENTIST. SEE, THERE'S LIKE CAVITIES AND ABSCESSES AND ROTTEN TEETH IN THERE. IT'S PRETTY FUNKY STUFF. THAT'S DEFINITELY THE DIRECTION I'M HEADING IN. I JUST WANT SOMETHING THAT'S GONNA INTIMIDATE THE BIGGEST, BADDEST DUDES OUT THERE. YOU HAVING, LIKE, A COMPETITION OR SOMETHING, OR...? I'M ACTUALLY A PROFESSIONAL WRESTLER. REALLY? YEAH. I'M TALKING SPANDEX AND TV STUDIOS AND BIG MUSCLES. REALLY? YEAH. THE PROBLEM IS, EVERYONE THINKS OF ME AS A PRETTY BOY, SO NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE TAKE ME SERIOUSLY, ACTUALLY. SORRY. SO, MY WRESTLING PERSONA IS A FILIPINO MALE SUPERMODEL WHO IS OBSESSED WITH HIS UNIQUE HAIRSTYLE. BUT PEOPLE SHOULD FEAR ME AND TAKE ME VERY, VERY SERIOUSLY. SO YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING... KIND OF THAT TRASH TALKING WHEN THEY'RE LIKE "I'M GONNA... WHATEVER," AND... YEAH. I JUST WANT SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO INTIMIDATE MY OPPONENT. WELL, I MEAN, THE TEETH ARE PRETTY COOL, BUT AS MUCH AS I LIKE THOSE, I THINK I CAN DO BETTER FOR YOU. WHAT KIND OF BUDGET ARE YOU WORKING WITH HERE? WELL, UH, I WOULD LIKE TO KEEP IT UNDER A GRAND. WITHIN THAT BUDGET, I'M POSITIVE I CAN GET YOU SOMETHING THAT THEY WILL NOT FORGET. I MEAN, I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE, AND WE SEE A LOT OF STUFF. GIVE ME A CHANCE ON THIS ONE. OKAY. WELL, I TRUST YOUR JUDGMENT. WORK YOUR MAGIC. ABSOLUTELY. I'LL BE BACK. HELLO. HOW ARE YOU, SIR? GOOD. YOUR OUTFIT'S INTERESTING. KIND OF LIKE A SHERLOCK HOLMES VIBE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SO, WHAT BRINGS YOU INTO OBSCURA? I KIND OF WANTED TO SEE IF YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN MAKING AN ACQUISITION. OH, I'D LOVE TO SEE IT. CAN I CHECK IT OUT? SURE. LOOKS LIKE A POCKET WATCH. WELL, IT'S ACTUALLY NOT A TIMEPIECE. IT CAPTURES PICTURES. OH, WOW. SO, HOW DOES THIS WORK? OKAY. IT'S BASICALLY A VERY SIMPLE PINHOLE CAMERA. LET'S SAY THERE'S SOMEONE ACROSS THE ROOM AND I WANT THEIR PICTURE. YOU WOULD PRESS RIGHT HERE. I WAS A PROFESSIONAL PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR FROM THE MID-'70s IN CALIFORNIA. ABOUT 40 YEARS AGO, I STARTED COLLECTING DETECTIVE, SPY, AND PRIVATE-EYE MEMORABILIA. THAT HAS NOW BECOME THE P.I. MUSEUM. IT'S AN INTERESTING OBJECT. DEFINITELY BE INTERESTED IN THIS PIECE. OKAY, BUT BEFORE WE SETTLE ON THIS, I'VE ACTUALLY GOT A P.I. MUSEUM ON WHEELS. UH-HUH. LOOK OVER MY SHOULDER. OH... NEAT PLACE YOU GOT HERE. WELL, THAT'S NEAT... HALF A PIG? DO YOU CUT THEM IN HALF OR DO YOU JUST GET THEM IN HALF? I'M NOT GONNA SAY. THERE SHOULD BE A BABY IN THERE. THERE SHE IS! AND YOU HAVE A HEALTHY BABY GIRL. IT'S GOT THAT FRESH, PLASTIC SMELL. THIS IS "ODDITIES." BEFORE WE SETTLE ON THIS, LOOK OVER MY SHOULDER. OH... LET'S CHECK IT OUT, MAN. ABSOLUTELY. AFTER YOU. THANK YOU. YOU KNOW, WHEN I FIRST SAW THIS, I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS A DELIVERY TRUCK OR SOMETHING. IT'S KIND OF LIKE A SWISS ARMY KNIFE... THERE'S JUST A LOT MORE THAN MEETS THE EYE. COME ON. I'LL SHOW YOU. COOL. OH, WOW. LOOK AT THIS PLACE. WHAT'S THIS GUY? WELL, THIS HAPPENS TO BE A KGB KEY-CHAIN CAMERA. SO, THIS IS A NEWER MODEL? THIS IS COLD-WAR ERA. IT WORKS LIKE A PINHOLE CAMERA. YOU'VE GOT FOUR SHOTS. ONCE YOU'VE PRESSED THIS, THAT SHOT'S TAKEN. THIS PIECE LOOKS REALLY COOL. WHAT IS THAT? OH, WELL... I FEEL LIKE I'VE SEEN THESE BEFORE. THIS IS A RECENT ACQUISITION. IT LOOKS LIKE A WHISTLE. WELL, YEAH, IT DOES KIND OF LOOK LIKE A WHISTLE. BUT, BASICALLY, WHAT YOU DO IS YOU HIDE IN A RECESSED DOORWAY, AND THEN YOU AIM THIS DOWN THE AREA YOU WANT TO WATCH LIKE SO. RIGHT. SO AROUND A CORNER, BASICALLY. AND YOU'RE ABLE TO SEE WHAT'S DOWN THE BLOCK BY HIDING IN THE RECESSED DOORWAY... YOU CAN LOOK IN THE MIRROR. I'M DEFINITELY INTERESTED, AND THAT'S A PRETTY COOL PIECE. SO, I'D BE INTERESTED IN THE EXPO AND THE LITTLE, ANGLED VIEWFINDER. BUT I'M ALMOST AFRAID TO ASK THE PRICE OF THESE BECAUSE THEY'RE RARE. HERE'S WHAT I'LL DO FOR YOU... HOW ABOUT $1,100 FOR BOTH? $1,100. ALL RIGHT, I CAN DO $1,100. YOU GOT A DEAL. ALL RIGHT. SOUNDS GOOD. GOOD DOING BUSINESS. LET ME WRAP THESE FOR YOU. ALL RIGHT, SOUNDS GOOD. RECENTLY, A PROFESSIONAL WRESTLER CAME INTO THE SHOP. HE WAS LOOKING FOR A PROP HE COULD USE TO INTIMIDATE HIS OPPONENTS WITH, SO I'M GONNA PAY A VISIT TO A COLLECTOR WHO SAID HE MIGHT HAVE AN ITEM OR TWO THAT MIGHT WORK. HEY. HI... MIKE. NICE TO MEET YOU IN PERSON. GOOD TO MEET YOU. THANKS FOR HAVING ME OVER. HOLY COW. NEAT PLACE YOU GOT HERE. THANKS! I LIKE THE MEDICAL AND THE NATURAL HISTORY. YEAH, WE TRY TO COMBINE. WELL, THAT'S NEAT... HALF A PIG? HALF-PIG, YEAH. DO YOU CUT THEM IN HALF OR DO YOU JUST GET THEM IN HALF? I'M NOT GONNA SAY. I HAVE TWO JOBS. I'M A PROFESSOR OF ENGLISH, AND I ALSO PUT DEAD THINGS IN JARS. I'VE COLLECTED EVER SINCE I WAS A LITTLE KID, WHETHER IT WAS LEGOS OR COMIC BOOKS. I SEEM TO AMASS THINGS, LIKE A GOPHER MAKING A BURROW, SO... SO, THE FIRST THING THAT CAME TO MIND IS THIS GUY RIGHT HERE. WOW. COMES STRAIGHT OUT OF YOUR NIGHTMARES. THAT'S A LAMPREY. MM-HMM. I CAN TELL, 'CAUSE THAT MOUTH... THOSE ARE ALL THOSE LITTLE TEETH IN THERE. THAT'S ALL TEETH, YEAH. THEY'RE REAL NASTY THINGS. YOU KNOW, A FISH OR A WHALE, WHATEVER GOES BY... THIS THING WILL ATTACH ITSELF. AND THOSE TEETH REALLY HOLD ON, AND THEY'LL KIND OF EAT INTO THEM. BASICALLY JUST EAT RIGHT THROUGH YOU. CRAZY. SUCK OUT YOUR BLOOD AND ALL OF THAT. YEAH, THAT IS LIKE A NIGHTMARE. LAMPREYS ARE EEL-LIKE PARASITIC CREATURES. THEY USE THEIR ROWS OF SHARP TEETH TO EAT THROUGH THE SCALES AND LATCH ON TO A FISH. THEY CAN GROW TO ALMOST 40 INCHES LONG. THEY HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO LATCH ON TO HUMANS AS WELL, BUT LUCKILY FOR US, THEY DON'T LIKE THE TASTE OF HUMAN BLOOD, AND THEY'LL QUICKLY LET GO. THAT'S KIND OF NEAT. THE THING IS, I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS GONNA READ SO MUCH. I ACTUALLY HAVE ONE I HAVEN'T PUT INTO A JAR YET. UH, CAN I SEE THAT? YEAH, SURE! I'LL GO GET IT. SURE. OH, GEEZ. YEAH. I CAN PULL HIM OUT FOR YOU, IF YOU WANT. UH... SURE. THEY SMELL TERRIBLE. AH, GEEZ. WHERE... THAT IS SO GROSS. YEAH. YOU WANT TO HOLD IT? SURE. WHY NOT? OH, THAT IS... YEAH. THAT IS DISGUSTING. AND THAT... OH, THEY DO STINK. GOD, LOOK AT THAT M... OKAY, I SEE THAT THE LINE HERE OF LITTLE DOTS... THOSE ARE, I BELIVE, THE SENSORY ORGANS, SO THEY COULD DETECT MOVEMENT OF A FISH OR ANOTHER ANIMAL, OF COURSE, TO GO AFTER THEM... TO GET THEM. IT HAS ONE MISSION, AND THAT MISSION IS DEATH. IT'S LIKE A SWIMMING, EVIL MOUTH. I'M JUST TRYING TO THINK IF THIS WILL WORK OR NOT. EVEN IF HE WERE TO HOLD IT UP AND, YOU KNOW, "LOOK AT THIS SAUSAGE," OR, YOU KNOW... I MEAN, AS COOL AND DISGUSTING AND HORRIBLE AS IT IS, I DON'T THINK IT'S THE RIGHT COOL-DISGUSTING-HORRIBLE THAT I'M LOOKING FOR. OKAY. ALTHOUGH, THANKS FOR SHOWING THAT TO ME. YEAH, NO PROBLEM. ANYTIME. I'LL SHOW YOU OUT. WONDERFUL. HI, GUYS. YOU NEED A HAND WITH ANYTHING? I THINK WE GOT IT. NO, WE GOT IT. UH-HUH. THIS IS MY BUDDY, MATTY. HEY, MATT. NICE TO MEET YOU. NICE, BIG BOX. YEAH. "CLINICAL MEDICINE"? YEAH. I WAS LOOKING FOR MY KNIFE WHEN I WAS DUMPSTER DIVING... UH-HUH. THEN I SAW THE "CLINICAL MEDICAL" SIGN ON THERE, AND, BEING AN EMT, I WANTED TO TAKE A LOOK. OH, YOU'RE AN EMT? YEAH, I'M A VOLUNTEER EMT. OH. I'VE KNOWN RYAN SINCE HIGH SCHOOL. ANYTIME I FIND SOMETHING ODD, I JUST THINK OF RYAN. I'M A VOLUNTEER EMT. I'M A VETERAN... I WAS IN THE ARMY AT ONE POINT. I'M A COOK, BUT I REALLY HATE THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS. AND A, UM... A FAILED MUSICIAN. SHOULD WE CHECK THEM OUT? LET'S TAKE A LOOK. OH, YEAH. WELL, ACTUALLY, I HAVE A CUSTOMER WHO HAD HER TONGUE CUT IN HALF. OH, I'VE ACTUALLY HAD THAT DONE, TOO. OH, THERE YOU GO. LIKE A SNAKE. I'LL JUST SHOW IT TO YOU. TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK. DO NOT DROP IT. OH, MY GOD. WHAT THE HELL IS THAT? THAT IS SO GROSS. THIS IS "ODDITIES." I WAS LOOKING FOR MY KNIFE WHEN I WAS DUMPSTER DIVING, AND I FOUND THIS BOX. SHOULD WE CHECK THEM OUT? LET'S TAKE A LOOK. OH, YEAH. THERE SHE IS. I'VE SEEN ONE OF THESE BEFORE, ACTUALLY. HAVE YOU? MM-HMM. YEAH, THIS IS NICE. IT'S WHAT THEY USED TO CALL AN OBSTETRICAL PHANTOM, AND MIDWIVES USED TO TRAIN ON THINGS VERY MUCH LIKE THIS FOR CENTURIES. THESE WERE ACTUALLY USED TO TEACH MIDWIVES HOW TO REPOSITION THE BABY FROM OUTSIDE OR FROM INSIDE. IF THERE WAS A BREACH BIRTH, TRY TO GET IT IN THE RIGHT POSITION. THE OLD ONES MADE OF LEATHER, MADE OF WOOD... THEY DIDN'T FEEL QUITE SO HUMAN. THIS ONE'S FAIRLY NEW, AND IT'S ACTUALLY... MM, FEELS PRETTY RIGHT TO ME. ALSO, WHAT YOU CAN'T DO ON THIS ONE IS DO A C-SECTION. ALTHOUGH, THERE SHOULD BE A BABY IN THERE. THERE IS A BABY IN THERE. I SEE A HEAD PEAKING. YEAH. AND THERE'S THE PLACENTA AND THE UMBILICAL CORD. YEAH. JUST SNAPS ON AND OFF, LIKE REAL LIFE. MM-HMM. AND YOU HA A HEALTHY BABY GIRL. IT'S GOT THAT FRESH, PLASTIC SMELL. IT DOES. SO, MATTY, YOU WERE LOOKING TO SELL THESE, I ASSUME. YEAH. I HAVE NO USE FOR THESE. OH, YEAH, UNFORTUNATELY THESE ARE A LITTLE NEW FOR US. THE OLD ONES... THOSE ARE VALUABLE, VERY HARD TO GET. SO, UNFORTUNATELY, MAN, WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO PASS ON THESE. ALL RIGHT, BUDDY. I'LL HELP YOU. WELL, THAT WAS A... SHOVE THIS THING BACK IN THERE. YOU GOT THAT? THAT'S THE HARD PART. IT IS. I'M ON THE HUNT FOR A CUSTOMER OF THE SHOP WHO IS A PROFESSIONAL WRESTLER. HE WANTS SOMETHING ODD OR STRANGE TO USE AS A PROP TO INTIMIDATE HIS OPPONENTS WITH. SO I'M HEADING OVER TO VISIT AN OLD CUSTOMER OF THE SHOP WHO SAYS HE HAS ONE OR TWO ITEMS THAT MIGHT WORK. HE ALSO HAS SOMETHING HE'S BEEN DYING TO SHOW ME FOR A WHILE. CALVIN. HEY, MIKE, WHAT'S GOING ON? HOW YOU DOING, MAN? COME ON IN. THANK YOU. THIS IS IT. NICE. THIS IS REALLY NICE. I LOVE THESE GUYS. I MEAN, THE CLASSIC... THE TWO-HEADED CALF. YEAH, I BOUGHT THIS ONE SOLID FROZEN. IT DIDN'T LIVE LONG. YEAH, THEY OFTEN DON'T LIVE LONG. MONIQUE OVER THERE ON THE STAND... SHE'S ACTUALLY A PROSTITUTE FROM THE 1920's. YEAH, IT'S KIND OF WEIRD. SHE HAS A VERY SHORT TORSO BUT LONG LEGS. SEXY. MY NAME IS CALVIN VON CRUSH. I'M A MACABRE COLLECTOR AND TATTOO ARTIST. I'VE ALWAYS BEEN INTERESTED IN THE WEIRD AND THE PARANORMAL AND STUFF LIKE THAT. I GREW UP VERY POOR, AND NOW THAT I'M A SUCCESSFUL TATTOO ARTIST, I SPEND A LITTLE EXTRA MONEY ON COLLECTION PIECES. I'M SURE YOU'VE SEEN PLENTY OF FREAKS IN JARS IN YOUR DAY, MIKE. NOT OFTEN DO YOU GET TO SEE ONE THAT'S STILL ALIVE. OH, MAN! WOW. A TWO-HEADED TURTLE. THOSE ARE BEAUTIFUL. HOW OLD ARE THOSE? THEY'RE ABOUT 2 YEARS OLD. WHEN YOU TURN IT LIKE THIS, YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE THEY'VE GOT SIX LEGS TOTAL AND TWO SEPARATE HEADS. THAT'S AMAZING. THE BIG FELLA... HE GETS TO GO WHEREVER HE WANTS, AND THE LITTLE ONE'S ALONG FOR THE RIDE. AS IN LIFE. BIRTHS OF CONJOINED TWINS WHOSE SKIN AND INTERNAL ORGANS ARE FUSED TOGETHER ARE AN INCREDIBLY RARE HAPPENING. 1 IN ABOUT EVERY 200,000 LIVE BIRTHS RESULT IN THIS, AND WHILE ONE TWIN MIGHT BE DOMINANT, THEY'RE OFTEN DEPENDENT ON EACH OTHER FOR THEIR SURVIVAL. FOR INSTANCE, THERE MAY BE TWO HEARTS BUT ONLY ONE STOMACH. THE REASON I STOPPED BY... I HAVE THIS CLIENT WHO'S A PRO WRESTLER, AND HE'S LOOKING FOR SOMETHING VERY UNUSUAL TO EITHER USE IN HIS ACT OR WHEN THEY'RE TALKING TRASH ABOUT THE OTHER PERSON... I GOT SOMETHING RIGHT HERE. OH! YEAH, CHECK THAT OUT. OH, MY GOD! THIS IS "ODDITIES." I HAVE THIS CLIENT WHO'S A PRO WRESTLER, AND HE'S LOOKING FOR SOMETHING VERY UNUSUAL TO EITHER USE IN HIS ACT OR WHEN THEY'RE TALKING TRASH ABOUT THE OTHER PERSON... I GOT SOMETHING RIGHT HERE. OH! YEAH, CHECK THAT OUT. OH, MY GOD! THIS IS ACTUALLY A HUMAN TONGUE. AND MOST OF THE ESOPHAGUS. THAT'S NUTS. THAT'S A REAL HUMAN TONGUE. HERE, TAKE A LOOK. HOLY... WOW. THAT'S A TONGUE, ALL RIGHT. THAT IS SO DISGUSTINGLY WONDERFUL. WHAT'S... IT'S LIKE A SOCK OR SOMETHING. WHAT IS THAT? YEAH, IT'S SOME TYPE OF FABRIC, AND I BELIVE IT'S TO SHOW THE LIMITATIONS OF THE HUMAN MOUTH. RIGHT, TO GIVE IT SOME CONTEXT. ABSOLUTELY. SO... WOW. WE ACTUALLY HAVE A CUSTOMER WHO HAD HER TONGUE CUT IN HALF. OH, I'VE ACTUALLY HAD THAT DONE TOO. OH, THERE YOU GO. LIKE A SNAKE. THAT'S GREAT, THOUGH. THIS ACTUALLY MIGHT WORK FOR THIS GUY. HE COULD MAKE UP SOME STORY ABOUT THIS WAS, YOU KNOW... THIS MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE LAST GUY HE BEAT IN THE RING. SOMETHING LIKE THAT. THIS IS FOR SALE, OR...? ABSOLUTELY. I'M NOT REALLY TOO ATTACHED TO IT. NEITHER IS THE ORIGINAL OWNER. YEAH. WOULD YOU POSSIBLY DO LIKE $500 ON THAT? I TELL YOU WHAT... I WILL DO $500, BUT IF ANY OUIJA BOARDS COME IN THE FRONT DOOR, I'D BETTER BE THE FIRST GUY YOU GIVE A CALL TO. YOU GOT YOURSELF A DEAL, MAN. EXCELLENT, MAN. THANKS, CALVIN. HERE'S YOUR TONGUE. THANKS. HEY. HI. WELCOME BACK. HOW YOU DOING? NICE TO SEE YOU. THIS IS JESSIE, MY LOVELY AND VIVACIOUS GIRLFRIEND. RECENTLY, MY CLIENT MIKE, WHO HAPPENS TO BE A PROFESSIONAL WRESTLER, CAME INTO THE SHOP. HE WAS LOOKING FOR A PROP TO USE TO SORT OF COUNTERACT HIS PRETTY-BOY PERSONA. I FOUND A REALLY DISGUSTING PIECE. HOPEFULLY, IT WILL BE PERFECT FOR HIM. YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO INTIMIDATE PEOPLE... YOU WANTED PEOPLE TO BE TALKING ABOUT YOU. "OH, MY GOD, THERE'S THE GUY WITH THE WHATEVER." ABSOLUTELY. UM... I'LL JUST SHOW IT TO YOU. TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK. AH, HERE WE GO. HERE WE GO! NOW, THIS IS IN AN ANTIQUE JAR, SO DO BE CAREFUL. IF IT FREAKS YOU OUT, DO NOT DROP IT. OH, MY GOD. WHAT THE HELL IS THAT? THAT IS SO GROSS. EXACTLY. WHAT IS THAT? IS THIS A TONGUE? IT IS A HUMAN TONGUE. OH, MY GOD. ARE YOU SERIOUS? AM I LOOKING AT THE ESOPHAGUS, RIGHT HERE? AND TRACHEA. WHAT IS ALL THIS WHITE STUFF? WHAT'S... WHAT IS THAT? OH, IT'S CONNECTIVE TISSUE. PART OF IT'S MUSCLE, PART OF IT IS JUST FAT. EW. THIS WAS ACTUALLY A MEDICAL PREPARATION. YOU'LL SEE THIS PIECE OF FABRIC HERE. YEAH, I WAS GONNA ASK ABOUT THE FABRIC. THAT IS TO REPLICATE THE MOUTH... TO SHOW WHAT PARTS OF IT WOULD BE IN YOUR MOUTH, AS OPPOSED TO THE PART THAT WOULD BE PART OF YOUR THROAT. I COULD PICTURE MYSELF DOING A WRESTLING INTERVIEW WITH THIS TONGUE, SAYING SOMETHING LIKE, "THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED "TO THE LAST OPPONENT THAT I HAD. "I RIPPED HIS TONGUE OUT. THIS COULD BE YOUR FUTURE AFTER TONIGHT." SOMETHING LIKE THAT. SO GROSS. - THERE ARE NO TABOOS WITH ME. - SWEET. THIS IS PERFECT. I'M DISGUSTED. I FEEL SORRY FOR MY OPPONENTS. I FEEL SORRY FOR YOUR FRIEND HERE. YOU WANT TO KISS THAT? NO. OH, MY GOD! I GOT TO HAVE THIS. MIKE, HOW MUCH? UM... I DID STAY UNDER YOUR BUDGET, BUT IT WAS A LITTLE ON THE PRICEY SIDE. UM... WHAT ARE WE TALKING, HERE? WHAT'S THE DAMAGE? $750 I NEED ON THIS TONGUE. I SAID IF YOU COULD FIND ME SOMETHING TWISTED ENOUGH... MORBID ENOUGH... I WAS WILLING TO PAY UP TO A GRAND, AND I HAD MY DOUBTS, BUT YOU'VE DEFINITELY OUTDONE YOURSELF WITH THIS ONE. $750... YOU GOT YOURSELF A DEAL, SIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NO, THANK YOU. AND LOVELY MEETING YOU. NICE TO MEET YOU, TOO. I'M REALLY HAPPY MIKE LIKED THIS TONGUE IN A JAR. HOPEFULLY HE CAN USE IT TO SORT OF FAKE OUT AND PIN DOWN HIS OPPONENTS AND END WITH A CLEAN FINISH. I JUST HOPE IT'S NOT A CLEAN FINISH WITH HIM AND HIS LADY FRIEND. SHE SEEMED REALLY FREAKED OUT BY THIS THING. WE'LL STICK THAT IN A BOX. YOU DON'T WANT TO WALK AROUND WITH YOUR TONGUE FLAPPING AROUND OUT THERE. YEAH, I DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT ON THE WAY HOME.
