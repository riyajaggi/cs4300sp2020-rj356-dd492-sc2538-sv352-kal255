 WHOA! WELL, UNLESS YOUR GRANDMA'S A BIT OF A KOOK. IS THAT A STRAITJACKET? I'M MIKE. AND I'M EVAN. Both: WE'VE SPENT OUR ENTIRE LIVES... COLLECTING AND DEALING... HUNTING AND PICKING... TO GET THIS BUSINESS... DOWN TO A SCIENCE. THIS IS "ODDITIES." HEY, BUDDY, CAN YOU SPARE A DIME? HERE, GO BUY YOURSELF SOMETHING PRETTY. OH, NICE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MAN. HOW YOU DOING, MIKE?

 GOOD TO SEE YOU, BUDDY. I'M SIX. I'M A TATTOO ARTIST OUT AT WILD CHILD TATTOOS IN LONG ISLAND. I LOVE MAKING PERMANENT MARKS FOR PEOPLE. GIVING THEM SOMETHING THEY CAN CARRY WITH THEM FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES. YOU GET TO TAKE THAT RIGHT INTO THE GROUND WITH YOU. I BROUGHT YOU A LITTLE SOMETHING THERE. OH, MAN! SOME KIND OF MONKEY HANDS. WOW, THOSE ARE BEAUTIFUL. GIMME FIVE. OR TEN. THAT'S AMAZING. LOOKING BY THE COLOR AND EVERYTHING, I'D SAY THEY'RE PROBABLY CHACMA BABOON. THEY'RE MOSTLY DARK, BUT THEY ALSO USE LIGHTER COLORS IN THEM. HOW BIG IS THAT BABOON? IF IT WAS STANDING HERE, FROM HERE, I'D SAY THEY'RE ABOUT, OH, YEA BIG, MAYBE 3, 3 1/2 FEET TALL. THEY'RE SMALL, BUT THEIR MUSCLES, AND THE TYPE OF MUSCLES THEY HAVE AND THE CONFIGURATION, THEY'RE INCREDIBLY STRONG. I MEAN, THIS GUY... ACTUALLY, I'M READING THIS BOOK... HE USED TO WORK ON A MONKEY SHOW IN THE CIRCUS. AND THE MONKEYS... THEY HAVE A THING... 100 BUCKS IF YOU COULD BOX THE MONKEY. AND THE MONKEYS WOULD COME UP, AND THE MONKEYS WERE TRAINED... IT WAS A GUY, AND THEY WOULD KNOCK GUYS OUT. THEY'RE REALLY STRONGER THAN THEIR SIZE. THE REASON WHY APES AND MONKEYS ARE FIVE TIMES STRONGER THAN HUMANS IS A BIT OF A MYSTERY. THEY THINK THAT PERHAPS THE ENERGY THAT HUMANS PUT INTO BEING HUMAN, THE VERY FINE MOTOR SKILLS, THAT SAME ENERGY IS ACTUALLY USED FOR BRUTE STRENGTH IN THE MONKEYS. YOU SEE IN HERE ALL THE FINGERPRINTS OF THE HAND? IT'S LIKE OUR HANDS, BASICALLY. EVEN THE PALMS, I MEAN, IT'S SO CREEPY AND SIMILAR. NO. NO WEIRDNESS THERE. DEFINITELY HAS SOME AGE TO IT. IT HAS A GREAT, GREAT LOOK TO IT. I MEAN, THIS IS... I LOVE THIS KIND OF THING. THIS IS AMAZING. DO YOU WANT TO SELL 'EM? SURE. I MEAN, NORMALLY, A PIECE LIKE THIS, I COULD DO $150. THAT WOULD BE GREAT, MAN. ALL RIGHT, WELL, THANKS FOR BRINGING IT DOWN. NO PROBLEM, MAN. YOU BET. THESE ARE GREAT. Mike: HELP YOU WITH SOMETHING? Kevin: UH, I THINK I GOT IT. UH, WHAT THE HELL IS THAT? I CAN'T REALLY EXPLAIN WHAT IT IS. IT'S JUST VERY, VERY DIFFERENT AND ODD, AND I FIGURED YOU GUYS WERE THE GUYS TO BRING IT TO. ALWAYS HAPPY TO TAKE A LOOK. ONE OF THE STORAGE UNITS I JUST CLEANED OUT, THE BACK ROOM HAD ALL THESE REALLY WEIRD SHACKLES AND HANDCUFFS AND CHAINS. LIKE A DUNGEON OR SOMETHING? IT LOOKS LIKE IT WOULD COME OUT OF THAT. THERE WAS, LIKE, A RUG, AND IT HAD, LIKE, STAINS ON IT. THEN, I SEEN THIS IN THERE. OH, MY GOD! WOW! WHAT THE HELL IS THAT? THAT'S A MESS. IT'S LIKE A WITCHES' CAULDRON OR SOMETHING. THAT IS REALLY WEIRD-LOOKING. MY NAME'S KEVIN. I BUY STORAGE UNITS. THAT'S HOW I CAME ACROSS THIS. I WANTED NO PART OF IT, SO THAT'S WHY I BROUGHT IT OUT HERE TODAY. MAN, IS THAT THING DISGUSTING. I SEE IT'S GOT A KNIFE HERE OR SOMETHING? THE WEIRDEST THING IS THE WAY THE CROW FEATHERS ARE IN THERE. IT'S ALMOST LIKE THEY'RE GLUED, BUT IT'S NOT GLUE. I'M HOPING IT'S NOT BLOOD. WHEN YOU FIND SOMETHING THAT'S JUST SO WEIRD-LOOKING, YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT. THANKS FOR THINKING OF US. I'M GONNA GET GLOVES. I DON'T HAVE A TETANUS SHOT. I'M GONNA GET LOCKJAW FROM THAT THING. Evan: I'VE SEEN WITCHES' CAULDRONS WHERE THEY BREW POTIONS AND HERBAL REMEDIES, AND THIS IS NOT A WITCHES' CAULDRON. THIS THING LOOKS AND SMELLS EVIL, AND I'M NOT SURE I EVEN WANT IT IN THE SHOP. Evan: THIS IS HOW YOU FOUND IT? THIS IS BASICALLY THE WAY I FOUND IT. I POKED AROUND WITH ONE OF THE KNIVES, AND IT FEELS LIKE WHATEVER'S IN THERE'S PRETTY SOLID. Mike: ANYTHING COULD BE IN THERE. YEAH. IT COULD BE LEAD, IT COULD BE... EVIL. I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN THERE. SOLID, HEAVY EVIL. IT'S DEFINITELY NOT SOMETHING OF GOOD NATURE. DEFINITELY NOT. SENDING A WEIRD MESSAGE. IT'S TRYING TO SAY SOMETHING THERE. YES, IT'S A WARNING. UH, WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO WITH IT? YOU LOOKING TO SELL IT? I WAS REALLY LOOKING TO SELL IT, 'CAUSE I DON'T REALLY WANT TO HOLD ONTO IT ANYMORE. HALLOWEEN ISN'T FOR MONTHS. WE'RE INTERESTED IN THIS. HOWEVER, EVEN FOR US, THIS IS WEIRD. I MEAN, WHAT IS IT? IT'S GONNA DRIVE ME NUTS. YEAH, I MEAN, BEFORE WE BUY SOMETHING LIKE THIS, WE WOULD DEFINITELY NEED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT IT. ACTUALLY, DO YOU MIND LEAVING IT SO WE CAN DO SOME RESEARCH? WE'LL GET BACK TO YOU REALLY SOON ON THIS. IF I DON'T HAVE TO DRAG IT DOWN THE BLOCK, I'M FINE WITH THAT. ALL RIGHT, WE'LL SEE WHAT WE CAN FIND OUT. GREAT, THANKS, MAN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. TALK TO YOU VERY SOON. THIS CAULDRON IS REALLY FREAKY, BUT, THEN AGAIN, WE DO HAVE SOME WEIRD CUSTOMERS WHO ACTUALLY MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN IT... IF IT'S THE REAL DEAL, OF COURSE. AND THE WAY THIS THING'S ALL LOCKED UP, THERE MAY BE SOMETHING REALLY OLD AND VALUABLE INSIDE. HOPEFULLY WE'RE NOT CURSED. NOT YET. WHATCHA GOT THERE? OOH! GEEZ! Mike: THIS IS "ODDITIES." RECENTLY, A CUSTOMER CAME INTO THE SHOP WITH THIS REALLY STRANGE CAULDRON. I MEAN, IT HAD CHAINS AND KNIVES AND FEATHERS AND BLOOD. WE'VE DEFINITELY NEVER HAD ANYTHING LIKE THIS IN THE SHOP BEFORE. SO WE'RE GONNA BRING IT TO AN EXPERT IN ETHNOGRAPHIC ARTIFACTS TO FIND OUT JUST WHAT IT IS. BEAUTIFUL SHOP! THANK YOU. I'M VERY INTERESTED IN THE MAGICAL RELIGIOUS PRACTICES AND BELIEFS OF PEOPLES AROUND THE WORLD. HINDUISM, SHIVA, AND CABALA. I AM VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN CABALA. OH, IT'S VERY POPULAR. OH, YES. VERY, VERY POWERFUL. MY NAME IS MIGENE GONZALEZ-WHIPPLER. I'M A CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGIST. AND MY FIELD OF INTEREST IS MAGIC, RELIGION, AND MYSTICISM IN VARIOUS CULTURES AROUND THE WORLD. WITH A VERY ODD OBJECT. TO IT. WHAT WE HAVE. BASICALLY, IT'S A CAULDRON. IT'S FULL OF BLOOD AND FEATHERS. IT'S OUTSIDE... I CAN BRING IT IN IF YOU WANT TO SEE IT. NO, DON'T BRING IT IN. IF IT'S WHAT I THINK IT IS, I'D RATHER NOT HAVE IT IN THE STORE. YOU CARE TO TAKE A LOOK? YEAH, LET ME TAKE A LOOK. IT'S RIGHT OUT HERE. THAT... THAT LOOKS LIKE AN NGANGA TO ME. YES, THAT'S AN NGANGA. THAT'S AN INSTRUMENT FOR MAGIC, AND THIS COMES FROM CONGO. AND IT'S USED IN A RELIGION KNOWN AS PALO. OH, OKAY. PALO MAYOMBE STARTED IN THE CONGO AND MOVED INTO THE CARIBBEAN. EVERYONE'S HEARD OF VOODOO AND SANTERIA, BUT PALO MAYOMBE IS ACTUALLY THE WORLD'S STRONGEST FORM OF BLACK MAGIC. YOU SEE FEATHERS OF THE SACRIFICIAL ANIMALS, AND THEY'RE ALWAYS BLACK CHICKENS. THEY ARE BLOOD SACRIFICES. THE BLOOD IS POURED ON IT. AND WHAT WOULD THIS BE USED FOR, EXACTLY? ANYTHING YOU WANT. YOU CAN GET SOMEONE TO LOVE YOU. YOU CAN GET MONEY, AND YOU CAN TOPPLE GOVERNMENTS, CAN DO WHATEVER. THAT'S HOW POWERFUL THAT THING IS. YOU CAN EVEN KILL SOMEBODY. IN THERE LIVES AN ENTITY KNOWN AS AN INFUMBE. SO THERE'S A SPIRIT IN THERE? YES. ALL AROUND THE CAULDRON IS WRAPPED IN CHAINS, AND IT HAS PADLOCKS. AND THE PURPOSE OF THE CHAINS AND THE PADLOCK IS SO THAT THE BEING IN THERE, THE SPIRIT IN THERE DOES NOT ESCAPE. BEST NOT TO OPEN THIS, THEN. YOU REMOVE THE CHAIN, YOU'RE FREEING THE NGANGA. YOU DON'T WANT TO DEAL WITH THAT. THIS IS VERY, VERY DANGEROUS. VERY FIERCE AND VERY AGGRESSIVE. UH-HUH. THIS THING IS CAPABLE OF DESTROYING 9th AVENUE. WOW. YES, THAT THING CAN DO A LOT OF DAMAGE. WELL, IT SEEMS WE'RE IN POSSESSION OF A CAULDRON WITH AN EVIL SPIRIT IN IT CAPABLE OF MASS DESTRUCTION. HOWEVER, THAT BEING SAID, I'M REALLY CURIOUS TO FIND OUT WHAT'S INSIDE OF THIS THING. HEY, GUYS. HELLO. LET ME KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT ANYTHING. WINDOW SHOPPING TODAY. I DROPPED INTO OBSCURA A WHILE BACK AND WAS ABLE TO PICK UP SOME AMAZING SIDESHOW PROPS. I THOUGHT HEATHER MIGHT ENJOY SOME OF THE OTHER ODDITIES THAT THEY HAVE. WHAT IS THAT UP THERE? WHAT'S THAT ONE? THE HAT? NO, ABOVE THAT. OH, THIS IS ACTUALLY A RAT SKELETON. WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO PULL IT DOWN? YEAH. KIND OF AN INTERESTING PIECE. IT'S GOT SOME AGE TO IT, PROBABLY FROM THE '50s OR '60s. IT'S ACTUALLY HALF OF A RAT. IT'S NOT A FULL RAT. FOR WHATEVER REASON, THEY CUT THE RAT IN HALF, COMPLETELY, AND MOUNTED HIM ONTO THIS BOARD, AND IT'S PROBABLY THROUGH A MEDICAL SUPPLY CATALOG OR SOMETHING FOR SCHOOLS. YEAH, WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THAT BONE THERE? IT'S THE HYOID BONE, WHICH IS THE BONE THAT'S LOCATED UNDER WHERE YOUR MANDIBLE IS, BASICALLY. IN MAMMALS, THE HYOID BONE IS THE ONLY BONE THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY ATTACHED TO ANY OTHER PART OF THE SKELETON. IT ACTUALLY SITS IN THE MUSCLE UNDER YOUR MANDIBLE. AND, IF BROKEN, THOUGH ACTUALLY QUITE RARE, IT HAPPENS IN ABOUT 1/3 OF ALL HOMICIDES DUE TO STRANGULATION, SO THE CORONER, THAT'S BASICALLY THE FIRST THING HE'LL LOOK AT IN A CASE. HOW MUCH DOES THIS GO FOR? WE'RE SELLING IT FOR $225. NOW, LAST TIME, I WAS ABLE TO GET A LITTLE BIT OF A DISCOUNT BY DOING A COUPLE OF PERFORMANCES. OH, OKAY. WE ARE A TEAM OF SIDESHOW PERFORMERS. WE'VE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER FOR ABOUT EIGHT YEARS, PERFORMING ACTS LIKE HUMAN BLOCKHEAD... SWORD SWALLOWING... FIRE EATING... KNIFE THROWING... ALL THAT TYPE OF STUFF. LAST TIME I WAS HERE, I STUCK A DRILL INTO MY FACE. IT FEELS GOOD. I WAS WONDERING IF YOU MIGHT WANT TO SEE A COUPLE OF SKILLS THAT HEATHER HAS. WHAT DO YOU HAVE? ONE OF THE MAIN THINGS I'M KNOWN FOR IS SWALLOWING SWORDS. I'D ABSOLUTELY LOVE TO SEE YOU SWALLOW A SWORD. HEATHER MAKES SWALLOWING SWORDS AND EATING FIRE LOOK EASY. IT'S NOT. IT'S REAL, IT'S DANGEROUS. DO NOT TRY WHAT YOU SEE US DO YOURSELVES AT HOME. HEATHER'S GONNA TAKE THAT SWORD RIGHT THERE, SHE'S GONNA PUT IT UP AGAINST THOSE PRETTY LITTLE LIPS. THE SWORD IS GONNA PASS HER LIPS, SLIDE DOWN HER ESOPHAGUS, ENTER INTO HER STOMACH, AND ACTUALLY REST AT THE BASE OF HER STOMACH. SHE WILL THEN DOUBLE HER BODY IN HALF, TAKING A BOW RIGHT AT YOU, AND WHEN SHE GIVES YOU THE SIGNAL, WHEN SHE STARTS WINKING LIKE THAT, THAT'S GONNA BE YOUR CUE TO GRAB THE END OF THE SWORD AND EXTRACT IT FROM HER BODY. OKAY, I MEAN, IF YOU THINK THAT I'M QUALIFIED TO TAKE THIS THING OUT OF YOUR THROAT, BY ALL MEANS, LET'S TRY IT. THERE'S THE WINK. ALL RIGHT. JUST REMEMBER, IF YOU MESS UP... SHE DIES. THIS IS A 320,000-VOLT X-RAY SYSTEM. THE X-RAYS WILL COME OUT OF HERE, AND THEY'RE GONNA SHOOT RIGHT THROUGH THE CAULDRON. WE'LL GIVE IT A SHOT AND SEE WHAT WE GET. Mike: THIS IS "ODDITIES." ONE OF THE MAIN THINGS I'M KNOWN FOR IS SWALLOWING SWORDS. I'D ABSOLUTELY LOVE TO SEE YOU SWALLOW A SWORD. Donny: THERE'S THE WINK. ALL RIGHT. JUST REMEMBER, IF YOU MESS UP... SHE DIES. OH, MY GOSH. AHH. I'M THOROUGHLY IMPRESSED. WELL, NOT ONLY IS HEATHER AN AMAZING SWORD SWALLOWER, BUT, UM, WELL, WE'LL JUST SHOW YOU. WATCH THIS. WHATCHA GOT THERE? OOH! GEEZ! JUST BE CAREFUL. YOU GOT A LOT OF FUR IN THE BACK OF YOU AND FABRICS. JUST MIND EVERYTHING IN THE SHOP BEING SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BURN. SORRY, I'M JUST WAITING FOR THE LANTERN TO CATCH ON FIRE. FIRE BREATHING GOES BACK CENTURIES, AND PERFORMERS LIKE HEATHER TRAINED WITH SKILLED MASTERS. SHE'S APPLYING THIS HEAT ALMOST DIRECTLY TO HER SKIN WITH ONLY THE SALIVA IN HER MOUTH TO PROTECT HER. VERY NICELY DONE. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS JOB. SO, ALL THOSE THINGS TOGETHER, YOU THINK WE CAN GET A DISCOUNT ON THE RAT? ABSOLUTELY. WE HAD IT MARKED AT $225. HOW'S $175? DOES THAT WORK FOR YOU? I'LL TAKE IT. OKAY, COOL. THAT WAS AMAZING. THE OTHER DAY, A CUSTOMER BROUGHT IN A LARGE IRON CAULDRON, AND ACCORDING TO THE EXPERT WE BROUGHT IT TO, IS CALLED A NGANGA AND FILLED WITH EVIL SPIRITS. SHE WARNED US NOT TO OPEN THIS THING, BUT WE'RE REALLY CURIOUS TO SEE WHAT'S INSIDE OF IT. SO TODAY WE'RE GONNA BRING IT TO A VERY HIGH-END IMAGING CENTER. THEY HAVE MACHINERY THEY SAID COULD PEER THROUGH ANYTHING. THIS IS THE NGANGA WE WERE TELLING YOU ABOUT. WOW! THAT'S SOMETHING. THIS ISN'T THE SORT OF THING WE NORMALLY DEAL WITH, BUT WE REALLY WANT TO SEE WHAT'S INSIDE THIS THING WITHOUT TOUCHING IT OR DISRUPTING IT IN ANY WAY. SO, YOU SEEM LIKE THE GUY TO GO TO. OKAY, WELL, WE'LL GIVE IT A SHOT. EXCELLENT. I'M PRESIDENT OF BAKER TESTING SERVICES. THIS IS A NON-DESTRUCTIVE TESTING COMPANY THAT DOES INDUSTRIAL X-RAY, MAGNETIC PARTICLE INSPECTION, ULTRASONICS. BASICALLY ANYTHING THAT ANYBODY WANTS X-RAYED, WE CAN X-RAY IT. AFTER YOU. WHY, THANK YOU. NGANGAS FIRST. WE'RE GONNA FIRST TRY TO SHOOT THIS WITH X-RAYS, BECAUSE X-RAYS WILL PROBABLY GIVE US THE CLEAREST IMAGE. THIS IS A 320,000-VOLT X-RAY SYSTEM. IT HAS A CAPABILITY OF GOING THROUGH ABOUT 2 INCHES OF STEEL. THE X-RAYS WILL COME OUT OF HERE, AND THEY'RE GONNA SHOOT RIGHT THROUGH THE CAULDRON, WE HOPE, TO THE OTHER SIDE, WHERE WE'LL PUT AN IMAGE PLATE. X-RAYS ARE LIKE A SUPER POWERFUL VERSION OF REGULAR LIGHT. SOME OF THESE WAVES WILL PASS RIGHT THROUGH AN ITEM, AND SOME OF THEM DON'T. THE ONES THAT PASS THROUGH ARE COLLECTED ON AN IMAGE PLATE, AND WHEN THIS IS DEVELOPED, THAT CREATES THE VIEWABLE X-RAY IMAGE. THIS IS THE DIGITAL IMAGE OF THE X-RAY THAT WE'VE TAKEN. THESE ARE THE LEGS OF THE CAULDRON RIGHT HERE. IS THAT IT? WELL, THE X-RAY, IT LOOKS LIKE IT WASN'T POWERFUL ENOUGH TO GET THROUGH THIS. IT SEEMS THE MATERIAL THAT'S INSIDE IS TOO DENSE. I REALLY WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S IN THERE. WELL, WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO TRY GAMMA RAY. GAMMA RAY. WE'RE GONNA TRY COBALT 60 AND SEE IF WE CAN GET THROUGH IT WITH THAT. IF YOU CAN'T GET ANYTHING ON COBALT 60... WE'RE ALL DONE. WE'RE ALL DONE. ALL RIGHT. X-RAYS WILL GET THROUGH THE EQUIVALENCY OF ABOUT 2 INCHES OF STEEL. AND THE COBALT 60 CAN GET THROUGH 7 OR 8 INCHES OF STEEL. THIS IS THE GAMMA RAY VAULT. THIS IS THE COBALT 60 SOURCE. IT'S RADIOACTIVE, BUT THESE ARE SHIELDED WITH DEPLETED URANIUM, TO KEEP THE RADIATION INSIDE. IT'S A MATERIAL THAT'S DENSER THAN LEAD. BUT WE'RE SAFE RIGHT HERE? YOU'RE SAFE RIGHT THERE. YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO USE IT AS A PILLOW. RIGHT. RADIATION OF THIS INTENSITY WOULD NEVER BE USED FOR HUMAN DIAGNOSTICS. IT WOULD CREATE BURNS, ULCERS, INFECTIONS. LONG TERM, YOU'D BE PRONE TO CANCER AND OTHER INFECTIONS. SO YOU'RE BASICALLY BOMBARDING THE OBJECT WITH RADIOACTIVE... GAMMA RADIATION. AND THEN IT'S JUST WHATEVER HITS THE PLATE IS WHAT DOESN'T GET STOPPED. THAT'S CORRECT. WE'RE GONNA PUT A DIGITAL PLATE ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE OBJECT, AND THEN THE RADIATION SOURCE WILL BE ON THE FRONT SIDE OF THE OBJECT. THEN WE'LL LEAVE IT THERE FOR THE SET EXPOSURE TIME, DEPENDING ON THE THICKNESS OF WHAT WE'RE GOING THROUGH AND THE DISTANCE WE ARE FROM THE PLATE. WE'LL ENERGIZE THIS, AND WE'LL GO INTO THE VIEWING ROOM AND VIEW THE IMAGES. SOUNDS GOOD. ALL RIGHT, WE SHOULD HAVE ANOTHER SHOT. LET'S TAKE A LOOK. OH, MY GOODNESS. Mike: THIS IS "ODDITIES." WE'RE AT A HIGH-TECH IMAGING CENTER, TRYING TO DETERMINE THE CONTENTS OF THIS FREAKY CAULDRON THAT A CUSTOMER BROUGHT IN AND AN EXPERT WARNED US NOT TO OPEN. EVAN AND I ARE DYING TO KNOW WHAT'S INSIDE THIS THING. SO FAR, THE TESTS HAVE REVEALED NOTHING. ALL RIGHT, WE SHOULD HAVE ANOTHER SHOT. LET'S TAKE A LOOK. OH, MY GOODNESS. IT LOOKS LIKE WE'VE PENETRATED IT MORE NOW. WE'VE STARTED TO IMAGE SOME THINGS UP HERE. THOSE LOOK LIKE RAILROAD SPIKES. IT DOES LOOK LIKE A RAILROAD SPIKE. LIKE A LOT OF 'EM SORT OF STUCK THROUGH. ALL STUCK IN, YEAH. SEE? AGAIN, HERE, YOU CAN SEE THE HEAD OF THE RAILROAD SPIKE. EVERYTHING'S SHARP AND POINTY IN THIS THING. YES, IT IS, YEAH. I MEAN, I LOOK AT THIS THING, I THINK TETANUS. NOW, THIS LOOKS LIKE SOME TYPE OF HOLLOW STEEL BALL. BECAUSE YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE THE EDGES OF IT. SO THAT MEANS IT'S HOLLOW. IT ALSO LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE A DENSITY CHANGE RIGHT HERE. WHICH MEANS THERE WAS SOME TYPE OF MAYBE FLUID IN THERE AT ONE TIME, THAT'S ALL CONGEALED OR HARDENED... MAYBE JUST DIRT OR SOMETHING ABOVE THAT. YOU KNOW, IT'S HARD TO SAY. RIGHT. ABSOLUTELY. IT LOOKS LIKE WE MIGHT HAVE SOME BULLETS OVER HERE. BULLETS? YEAH. THIS LOOKS LIKE A BULLET. RADIATION, AMMUNITION... IT'S ALL THE GOOD STUFF. WELL, THANK YOU SO MUCH. THIS HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY FASCINATING. YOU'RE WELCOME. IT WAS NICE MEETING YOU. I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT WE WERE EXPECTING TO FIND INSIDE OF THIS NGANGA, BUT HONESTLY, THIS THING STILL CREEPS US OUT. I THINK IT MIGHT BE TIME JUST TO BRING IT BACK TO THE OWNER AND TELL HIM WHAT WE'VE FOUND OUT AND FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO WITH IT NEXT. HEY, KEVIN, HOW YOU DOING? Evan: GOOD TO SEE YOU! HOW HAVE YOU BEEN? NOT BAD. ANTICIPATING. WE LEARNED A THING OR TWO ABOUT THIS. OH, QUITE A FEW THINGS, ACTUALLY. IT'S A REALLY STRANGE THING YOU FOUND HERE. IT'S A VERY, VERY POWERFUL OBJECT. IT'S ACTUALLY CALLED AN NGANGA. OH, YEAH? I LOVE SAYING "NGANGA." WE ACTUALLY SHOWED IT TO THIS WOMAN HERE IN TOWN WHO'S INTO SORT OF UM, A LOT OF THE CARIBBEAN RELIGIONS, AND OTHER RELIGIONS, TOO. THERE'S A LOT OF REALLY WEIRD INFORMATION ABOUT THIS THING. THERE'S A SPIRIT IN YOUR NGANGA. IT'S TRAPPED IN THERE, BEING ETERNALLY TORMENTED. BASICALLY, THEY CAPTURE A SPIRIT, AND THEY IMPRISON HIM IN HERE, OR IT. THESE THINGS ARE APPARENTLY CAPABLE OF GREAT EVIL. WE ACTUALLY BROUGHT IT TO A LABORATORY TO HAVE THEM TEST IT TO SEE EXACTLY WHAT'S INSIDE. YOU GUYS BROUGHT THIS TO GET IT X-RAYED? YEAH. AND THE RESULTS ARE PRETTY INTERESTING. WE DIDN'T WANT TO DISTURB THIS THING AND TAKE IT APART OUT OF RESPECT FOR YOU... IT'S YOURS... AND ALSO, WE DON'T WANT TO PISS OFF THE NGANGA. WE WANTED TO LOOK INTO THAT, BUT WE DIDN'T WANT TO DIG IT OUT. WE ACTUALLY HAVE A FILM, IF YOU WANT TO SEE IT. NOW, THIS WAS THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF RADIATION THAT THEY HAD, AND THIS WAS THE ULTIMATE DETAIL THAT THEY GOT OUT OF THAT THING. AND AS YOU CAN SEE, I MEAN, THERE'S A LOT OF STUFF IN THERE. IT'S VERY DENSE IN THERE. THIS IS THE TOP LOOKING DOWN. WE FOUND BULLETS IN HERE. THERE ALL THESE SPIKY, POINTY THINGS. ALL THOSE ARE RAILROAD SPIKES. I WONDER IF THAT WAS TO PROTECT IT FROM COMING OUT OR SOMETHING. EXACTLY. WELL, ARE YOU GUYS INTERESTED IN IT AT ALL? THIS IS DEFINITELY ONE OF THE WEIRDER THINGS WE'VE EVER SEEN HERE. AND, I MEAN, WE LEARNED SO MUCH, SO IT HAS BEEN GREAT, BUT I DON'T THINK WE CAN BUY IT FROM YOU. I DON'T THINK THIS IS OUR NGANGA. IT'S ALMOST... AND I HATE TO SAY THIS... ALMOST TOO WEIRD FOR US. AND WE LOVE WEIRD! MAYBE YOU GOT SOMEONE YOU'RE NOT TOO FOND OF... "HERE, I GOT YOU A NGANGA." IT'S GONNA BE A GOOD CHRISTMAS PRESENT. YEAH, EXACTLY. ALL RIGHT, WELL, THANKS AGAIN, MAN. I'M GLAD I GAVE YOU GUYS THE WEIRDEST THING YOU EVER SEEN. DON'T WANT TO BUY IT, A HAND GETTING IT OUTSIDE? YEAH, SURE, EVAN YOU CAN DO THAT, RIGHT? WITH PLEASURE. I'LL GET THE DOOR FOR YOU, MAN. LET'S GET THIS THING OUT OF HERE. WHAT THIS THING'S ORIGINAL PURPOSE WAS, OR HOW IT ENDED UP IN A STORAGE UNIT IN NEW JERSEY, WE'LL PROBABLY NEVER KNOW. HOWEVER, ONE THING I DO KNOW... I DON'T WANT THAT THING IN THE SHOP. GOODBYE, NGANGA. OOH. AH. Mike: YOU PARKED FAR OR...? Kevin: UH, DOWN THE BLOCK. OH, ALL RIGHT.
