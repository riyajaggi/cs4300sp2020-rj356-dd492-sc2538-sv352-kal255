 - HEY, WHAT'S UP, JORDY? - WHAT'S UP, MIKE? - WHAT'S UP, RYAN? WHAT'S IN THE BOX? - WELL, I GOT SOME - INTERESTING THINGS HERE FOR YOU GUYS TO CHECK OUT. I'VE BEEN STOPPING BY OBSCURA FOR YEARS. SEEMS I'M DRAWN TO MORE OF THE BIZARRE, ODD. I'M SORT OF A FREAK MAGNET. SEEMS LIKE THE BIZARRE COMES TO ME. - SO, - WHAT HAVE WE GOT HERE? I WAS HANGING OUT AT MY UNCLE'S FARM, AND HANGING IN SORT OF LIKE THE BACK OF THE PROPERTY IS LIKE THIS OLD, RUSTED-OUT, BURNED-OUT LOOKS LIKE A UTILITY KIND OF SHED, AND I FIND THIS. OH, LOOK AT THAT. WHAT IS IT, A HEART? THAT'S A HEART, ALL RIGHT. IT'S A PIG HEART. I MEAN, THE SHAPE OF IT, AND LIKE, YOU KNOW, THE STRIATED MUSCLE TISSUE. LOOKS PRETTY OLD, ACTUALLY. - I'VE SEEN MY FAIR SHARE OF - PICKLED HEARTS IN MY DAY. SHEEP, DOG, YOU NAME IT. THEY'RE ALL DONE FOR MEDICAL STUDY AND USE. - THEY REALLY HAVE A GREAT - DISTURBING - AND KIND OF CREEPY - LOOK TO THEM. THIS IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING WE WOULD BUY. I ALSO FOUND THIS. THAT'S NICE. THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL JAR, ACTUALLY. YEAH, THAT'S LIKE A MECHANICAL SPECIMEN JAR, SPECIFICALLY. - WAS HE IN - THE MEDICAL FIELD AT ALL? NO, HE WAS A REALLY KIND OF STRANGE, ECCENTRIC GUY, - BUT IT IS A LITTLE BIT OF - A SHOCKER - TO STUMBLE ACROSS - JARS OF HEARTS. - CAN I SEE THAT ONE? - YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. THAT JAR'S REALLY NICE. - YOU SHOULD - CHECK THIS ONE OUT. ARE THESE ALL HEARTS, OR ARE THERE OTHER ORGANS? NO, ANOTHER BEAUTIFUL PIG HEART. OH, GEEZ. THIS ONE'S KIND OF UNUSUAL. YEAH, I'LL SAY. IT LOOKS SMALLER THAN THE OTHER TWO, BY FAR. - YEAH, IT LOOKS - ALMOST HALF THE SIZE. YEAH. I LIKE THE WAY IT, LIKE, FLOATS AROUND IN THERE. YEAH, IT'S VERY MURKY. IT IS, RIGHT? - LOOK AT THAT. - THAT'S INTERESTING. IT'S WEIRD. - THEY ACTUALLY TOOK - WHAT LOOKS LIKE - A LITTLE SECTION OF - SOMETHING ELSE AND JUST ATTACHED IT THERE. YEAH, IT LOOKS LIKE SKIN. THERE'S ACTUALLY A TUBE IN IT. RIGHT, IT LOOKS LIKE THAT'S WHAT'S PROPPING IT. THERE'S SOMETHING WEIRD GOING ON HERE. - THIS IS NOT LIKE - THOSE OTHER HEARTS. THE MORE I LOOK AT THIS THING, ALL SORTS OF WHISTLES AND BELLS, ALARMS - ARE GOING OFF - IN MY HEAD, HERE. - THIS IS A REALLY - INTERESTING PIECE, - BUT IF THIS IS - WHAT I THINK IT IS, - THIS COULD BE - AN INCREDIBLE FIND. - BUT I DON'T WANT TO MAKE - AN OFFER TILL I FIND OUT EXACTLY WHAT THIS THING IS. DEFINITELY INTERESTED. IS IT POSSIBLE WE CAN GET THIS ONE LOOKED AT? - WE HAVE SOME PEOPLE - WE COULD TALK TO - WHO COULD HAVE A LITTLE MORE - EDUCATED OPINION ON IT - AND FIGURE OUT JUST WHAT'S - GOING ON HERE. - YEAH, - I TRUST YOU, MIKE. - GREAT. GIVE US A COUPLE DAYS, - AND, YOU KNOW, I'LL CALL YOU BACK SOON. - AWESOME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, - MAN. I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. NICE TO SEE YOU GUYS. - CHEERS. - TAKE CARE. JONATHAN! HI, MISS EVAN. GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE? WELL, I AM LOOKING FOR SOMETHING FOR MY NEWEST SHOW. - I'M JONNY CLOCKWORKS, - AND I'M A PUPPETEER. AT MY NEW PUPPET THEATER, I'M WORKING ON A PROJECT INVOLVING SPIRITUALISM AND MESMERISM, OR HYPNOTISM. I JUST GOT THIS THING - OUT OF A DENTIST'S OFFICE, - ACTUALLY. YOU'RE GONNA LOVE THIS. IT'S A LITTLE FRAGILE. TA-DA! WHAT IS IT CALLED? IT'S A HYPNO-WHIRL-A-SCOPE. HYPNO-WHIRL-A-SCOPE. VINTAGE 1950s. IT WAS USED TO INDUCE A HYPNOTIC STATE. - WELL, - STARING AT IT ALMOST DOES. WELL, I ACTUALLY GOT THIS OUT OF THE ESTATE OF A DENTIST. HE USED IT TO HYPNOTIZE HIS PATIENTS AS A PAINKILLER, AND YOU KNOW WHAT? BY ALL REPORTS, HE WAS A VERY SUCCESSFUL DENTIST. - TAKE TWO AND CALL YOU - IN THE MORNING. YEAH. A NATURAL HYPNOTIC STATE EXISTS WHEN YOU'RE FOCUSED SO STRONGLY ON ONE PARTICULAR THING THAT THE REST OF THE WORLD KIND OF DISAPPEARS, AND THIS LEAVES YOU VERY OPEN TO SUGGESTION. ABOUT 90% OF THE POPULATION IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO HYPNOTISM. IT'S SOMETHING YOU'RE EITHER BORN WITH OR YOU'RE NOT, AND IT NEVER CHANGES. I KNOW. IT DOES WORK. I'M NOT GONNA LOOK AT IT RIGHT NOW. IT'S TOO POWERFUL. IS THIS SOMETHING YOU COULD USE? - I WOULD DEFINITELY - BE INTERESTED - IN USING THAT - IN THE PROJECT. IT'S JUST GOT SUCH GREAT VISUAL POTENCY, IF NOT FOR ANYTHING ELSE, BUT THE FACT, ACTUALLY, I THINK WE PROBABLY COULD HYPNOTIZE SOMEBODY. SO, HOW MUCH DO YOU WANT FOR IT? IT'S PRETTY RARE. KIND OF ATTACHED TO IT. NEVER HAD ANOTHER ONE. ASKING $500. OH, EVAN, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE. HAVE YOU SEEN ANOTHER ONE? WELL, NO, BUT, I MEAN, I CERTAINLY COULD BUILD ONE, - I WOULD THINK, - AT SOME POINT. - YEAH, - BUT THIS IS THE REAL DEAL. I UNDERSTAND EVAN WANTS TOP DOLLAR FOR THIS HYPNO-WHIRL-A-SCOPE, AND I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY, IT BEING SUCH A UNIQUE PIECE, BUT I CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY FULL PRICE. I SUGGEST... IF I MIGHT SUGGEST SOMETHING. YEAH? THAT YOU COME ON BY - AND SEE THE NEW - CLOCKWORKS PUPPET THEATER. OKAY. I'D LOVE TO. - I'LL SET UP A LITTLE - DEMONSTRATION OF SOME OF THE THINGS I'VE BEEN WORKING ON, AND I'LL SEE IF I CAN HYPNOTIZE YOU. THEN WE CAN DISCUSS A MORE REASONABLE PRICE. OKAY, JONATHAN, - I'M NOT SUSCEPTIBLE - TO HYPNOTISM, BUT I ACCEPT YOUR CHALLENGE. I'D LOVE TO SEE YOUR THEATER, AND IF YOU CAN HYPNOTIZE ME AND MAKE A SUGGESTION FOR A REASONABLE PRICE, I WILL DEFINITELY CONSIDER THAT DISCOUNT. DEAL. CIAO! IN QUESTION. WOW. A PIG'S HEART IS MORE OF A VALENTINE SHAPE. IT DOESN'T HAVE THIS SORT OF ROUNDNESS HERE AT THE BOTTOM. IT IS QUITE FASCINATING. I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE. Mike: THIS IS "ODDITIES." YESTERDAY, PUPPETEER AND COLLECTOR JONNY CLOCKWORKS CAME INTO THE SHOP, LOOKING FOR SOMETHING FOR HIS LATEST HYPNOTICALLY THEMED PRODUCTION. - THE HYPNO-WHIRL-A-SCOPE - I SHOWED HIM IS A LITTLE OUT OF HIS BUDGET, BUT HE INVITED ME BACK TO THE THEATER Jonathan: AH, MISS EVAN. HE ALSO THINKS HE CAN HYPNOTIZE ME INTO GIVING HIM A BETTER DEAL. WELCOME TO THE CLOCKWORKS PUPPET THEATER. THIS IS INCREDIBLE. IT'S INCREDIBLE. THIS IS OUR WORKSHOP ROOM. UH-HUH. - YOU REMEMBER THAT COFFIN - FROM OBSCURA. - OH, YEAH. - A MILLION YEARS AGO. - I STILL PUT IT TO GOOD USE - AND SLEEP IN IT. IS THERE ANYONE IN THERE? - NO, NOT TODAY. - NOT TODAY. - WELL, I'D LOVE TO SEE - YOUR STAGE. ENTREZ-VOUS. - TAKE A SEAT... - I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT WHAT TO DO WITH THIS HYPNO-WHIRL-A-SCOPE. LET ME GET CHANGED AND I'LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU. - I WON'T GUARANTEE - THAT I CAN HYPNOTIZE EVAN, BUT I'LL SURE ENJOY TRYING. TO FIRST DEMONSTRATE THE POWERFUL NATURE OF THE HYPNO-WHIRL-A-SCOPE, MISS BABY JUNE. YOU ARE GETTING SLEEPY. SLEEPY. - Evan: - HYPNOSIS IS A STATE OF MIND CHARACTERIZED BY RELAXED BRAINWAVES AND HYPER-SUGGESTIBILITY. JONNY'S TRYING TO RELAX ME WITH THIS SHOW. IT'S A GOOD PLAN, BUT IT ISN'T GONNA WORK. JUST FOCUS YOUR EYES UPON THE MYSTERIOUS HYPNO-WHIRL-A-SCOPE. CONCENTRATE ON THE REVOLVING DISK. THINK ONLY OF SLEEP! DO AS I SUGGEST. MISS EVAN... IF YOU CAN HEAR THE SOUND OF MY VOICE, NOD YOUR HEAD ONCE. MISS EVAN, IN YOUR INNER MIND, YOU ARE WILLING TO LET THE HYPNO-WHIRL-A-SCOPE SELL FOR $200. AND YOU WILL AWAKE... NOW. SO, WHAT DO YOU SAY, EVAN? PERFECTLY WORTH... 500 BUCKS. $200. I GOT TO GET 500 BUCKS. $200. 200 BUCKS. I GOT TO GET $500. IT'S RARE. WELL, THIS IS FOR A WEALTHIER PUPPETEER THAN I. I THINK I'LL HAVE TO CREATE MY OWN. THE OTHER DAY, - A GUY CAME IN WITH WHAT HE SAID - WERE THREE PIG HEARTS PRESERVED IN JARS, - BUT ONE REALLY STOOD OUT - FROM THE OTHER TWO. - SO WE DECIDED TO TAKE THIS THING - TO AN EXPERT TO FIND OUT EXACTLY WHAT IT IS. - AND WHAT BETTER EXPERT IS THERE - TO SPEAK TO ABOUT HEARTS THAN A CARDIOLOGIST? - HELLO. - DR. KOHANI. - MIKE? - MIKE. - GOOD TO SEE YOU. - HEY, I'M RYAN. - NICE TO MEET YOU. - NICE MEETING YOU. THANKS FOR HAVING US OVER. COME ON IN. - Dr. Kohani: - I'M A CARDIOLOGIST. BOARD-CERTIFIED IN CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES AND I'M AFFILIATED WITH THREE MAJOR HOSPITALS IN NEW YORK. A CUSTOMER CAME INTO OUR SHOP... UH-HUH. - ...WITH THREE SPECIMENS - FOR SALE. HE SAID THEY WERE PIG HEARTS. TWO OF THEM LOOKED LIKE YOUR STANDARD PIG HEART, BUT THIS THIRD ONE... A LITTLE STRANGE. HERE IS THE SPECIMEN IN QUESTION. WOW. YOU KNOW, FROM WHAT I KNOW FROM COMPARATIVE ANATOMY, A PIG'S HEART IS MORE VALENTINE-SHAPED AND MORE LIKE A V-SHAPE. IT DOESN'T HAVE THIS SORT OF ROUNDNESS HERE AT THE BOTTOM. - THE FACT THAT - IT'S TRAPEZOID... I REALLY THINK YOU GOT A HUMAN HEART. - WOW. - HUMAN? THE MINUTE WE LOOKED AT IT, - WE KNEW THERE WAS SOMETHING - DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS ONE. - THERE IS SOMETHING - ABSOLUTELY DIFFERENT. FLAGS STARTED JUMPING UP AS SOON AS WE SAW IT. I WAS LIKE, - "WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF ORGANS, - A LOT OF ANIMAL ORGANS." NOW, WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THIS LITTLE SECTION RIGHT HERE? - IT LOOKS LIKE A PIECE OF SKIN - AND HAIR. RIGHT. IF YOU NOTICE, THERE IS A HOLE IN THERE, AND IT MAY BE A BULLET ENTRY. IT IS QUITE FASCINATING. I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE. LIKELY WAS A FATAL GUNSHOT. THE SKIN AND THE ROD, - I MEAN IT REALLY LOOKS LIKE, - YOU KNOW, IT'S FOLLOWING THE PATH. - YEAH, IT'S PROBABLY - SHOWING THE TRAJECTORY - OF THE BULLET - THROUGH THE HEART. WOW, THAT WAS NOT WHAT I WAS EXPECTING. I MEAN, I KNEW THIS THING - WAS SOME KIND OF - MEDICAL PREPARATION, - BUT TO FIND OUT - IT'S A REAL HUMAN HEART - WITH A BULLET HOLE - RIGHT THROUGH IT? - I MEAN, - THIS THING BLOWS ME AWAY. WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS, ONCE YOU PUNCTURE THE RIGHT VENTRICLE, WHICH IS THE MOST ANTERIOR CHAMBER OF THE HEART, THE GUSH OF THE BLOOD... IT'S QUITE DRAMATIC. - AND BLOOD COMES OUT OF - THE VENTRICLE AND IT ENCASES THE HEART INSIDE THE SAC, AND WHEN THE PRESSURE INSIDE THE CHAMBER GOES REALLY HIGH SO FAST, IT COLLAPSES THE HEART. AND ONCE IT'S COLLAPSED, NOW THERE IS NO MORE BLOOD FLOW UP TO THE BRAIN. - AND THAT'S IT? - AND THAT'S IT. IT'S SUDDEN DEATH. PERHAPS IT WAS USED IN SCHOOL OR IN SOME SORT OF PRESENTATION. IT IS QUITE FASCINATING. - NOW WE HAVE TO - ACTUALLY FIND OUT - WHETHER YOU CAN LEGALLY - OWN ONE OF THESE. YOU MAY WANT TO SPEAK TO AN ATTORNEY ABOUT THAT. THAT'S OUR NEXT STOP. I HAVE AN ITEM THAT MY DAUGHTER USED TO LOVE, AND NOW IT KIND OF TRAUMATIZES HER, - AND I THINK THIS IS - JUST THE PLACE FOR IT. YOU WANT TO HAVE A LOOK? SURE. OH. Mike: THIS IS "ODDITIES." - THE OTHER DAY, - A CUSTOMER CAME INTO THE SHOP - WITH THREE PRESERVED HEARTS - IN JARS, BUT ONE OF THEM REALLY STOOD OUT FROM THE OTHERS. - WE HAD THIS HEART LOOKED AT - BY A CARDIOLOGIST, - AND HE DETERMINED THAT - THIS IS ACTUALLY HUMAN WITH A BULLET HOLE RIGHT THROUGH IT. I'M NOT TAKING ANY CHANCES, - SO WE'RE GONNA MEET WITH - MY LAWYER - TO FIND OUT IF WE CAN LEGALLY - BUY AND SELL THIS THING. COME ON IN. MY NAME'S RON KUBY. I'M A CRIMINAL DEFENSE AND CIVIL RIGHTS LAWYER HERE IN NEW YORK. MY CLIENTELE IS A LITTLE OBSCURE, SO IT'S TOTALLY APPROPRIATE THAT OBSCURA CALLED ME. SO... WELL, WE COME TO YOU TODAY WITH HEART IN HAND. YES. LITERALLY. LITERALLY. HERE'S THE HEART. OH! IT'S A LITTLE MURKY. OH! WHAT IS THIS HAIR HERE? A SECTION OF CHEST. OKAY. THIS PIECE WALKED INTO OUR STORE. A CUSTOMER BROUGHT IT IN. NOT BY ITSELF. I WAS GONNA SAY... THIS HEART IS HUMAN. IT WAS ACTUALLY A MEDICAL PREPARATION, SHOWING THE TRAJECTORY OF A BULLET WOUND. I'M ASSUMING YOU'RE HERE BECAUSE THIS IS SOMETHING YOU WANT TO BUY OR SELL OR TRADE. HOPEFULLY. WE HAVEN'T ACTUALLY BOUGHT THIS PIECE YET, BUT WE WANTED TO SPEAK TO YOU AND FIND OUT, LEGALLY, CAN WE BUY IT, CAN WE SELL IT, WHAT ARE THE LEGAL RAMIFICATIONS OF HAVING A HUMAN HEART? - WELL, FIRST, - I GOT TO TELL YOU, I SO MUCH APPRECIATE MY CLIENTS WHO ASK ME BEFORE THEY DO THE THING THAT ENDS UP BEING ILLEGAL, 'CAUSE MOST PEOPLE DON'T. MOST PEOPLE CALL ME AFTER THEY GET ARRESTED, SO THIS PART OF IT IS GREAT. YOU'VE TOTALLY GOT THE RIGHT PROCESS. SAFETY FIRST, YES. SO, YOU KNOW, FEDERAL LAW SETS CERTAIN STANDARDS... MINIMUM STANDARDS... THAT HAVE TO BE MET. THERE ARE SOME STATES THAT BAR SALES OF CADAVERS, SALES OF BODY PARTS, BUT LET ME DO A LITTLE LEGAL RESEARCH. - WONDERFUL. - OKAY, GREAT. THANKS AGAIN, RON. - GREAT TO SEE YOU. - TAKE, UH... I'LL TAKE THIS. WHICH HAND WERE YOU... I HAD IT IN THIS HAND. ALL RIGHT. - THANKS A LOT, RON. - ALWAYS A PLEASURE. JUST BE CAREFUL WITH THAT. THANK YOU, I WILL. ALL RIGHT, BUDDY. HEY, HOW YOU DOING? GOOD, HOW YOU DOING? MY NAME IS MIKE JERSEY. I'M... FROM NEW JERSEY, AND I'M COMING INTO OBSCURA TODAY TO TRADE SOMETHING THAT I THINK IS REALLY UNUSUAL, AND I THINK THIS WOULD BE JUST THE PLACE FOR IT. - I'M LOOKING TO TRADE - FOR SOMETHING. I HAVE AN ITEM THAT MY DAUGHTER USED TO LOVE, AND NOW IT KIND OF TRAUMATIZES HER. OH. NOT TO LAUGH, BUT IT'S... SOUNDS SPECIAL. YEAH, IT WAS SPECIAL, AND IT'S STILL SPECIAL TO ME, BUT NOT TO HER ANYMORE, - SO I THINK IT'S TIME - TO GET RID OF IT, - AND I THINK THIS IS - JUST THE PLACE FOR IT. IS THAT THIS? YOU WANT TO HAVE A LOOK? SURE. LET ME MOVE THIS FOR YOU. BASICALLY, WE WENT TO A PETTING ZOO. WHICH IS USUALLY NOT A TRAUMATIZING EVENT FOR A CHILD. KIDS USUALLY LIKE THEM. YEAH. - BUT THE PROBLEM WAS - SHE SAW A SHEEP, AND IT REALLY FREAKED HER OUT. DID IT BITE HER OR SOMETHING? NO, NOTHING LIKE THAT. - THE PROBLEM WAS - PRIOR TO THE PETTING ZOO, SHE THOUGHT ALL SHEEP LOOKED LIKE THIS. OH! I CAN SEE THE PROBLEM. Mike: THIS IS "ODDITIES." - I'M LOOKING TO TRADE - FOR SOMETHING. I HAVE AN ITEM THAT MY DAUGHTER USED TO LOVE, AND NOW IT KIND OF TRAUMATIZES HER, - AND I THINK THIS IS - JUST THE PLACE FOR IT. WANT TO HAVE A LOOK? SURE. OH! - LAMBY! - OH, YEAH. - YOU MIND IF WE TAKE - A CLOSER LOOK? - OH, PLEASE. YOU WANT TO GRAB THE... WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT NOTHING HAPPENS TO HIM. YEAH, DON'T BREAK MY SHEEP, PLEASE. YEAH. SO, LOOK AT THAT. NO, HE'S GREAT. - WHERE ON EARTH - DID YOU GET THIS? THIS HAS ACTUALLY BEEN IN THE FAMILY A LONG TIME. - MY GREAT UNCLE IN JERSEY - HAD A FARM. - THIS CAME OUT OF - ONE OF THE SHEEP, AND HE SAW HOW AWESOME IT WAS AND IT'S KIND OF THE FIXTURE... - FAMILY HEIRLOOM, - BASICALLY. EXACTLY. WE'VE HAD IT FOR ABOUT 12 YEARS NOW. HUMAN OR ANIMAL OR WHATEVER, ARE ACTUALLY IDENTICAL TWINS THAT DON'T FULLY SEPARATE IN THE UTERUS OR BECOME CONJOINED WITHIN THERE, AS WELL. IT COULD BE CONNECTED ANYWHERE. IT COULD BE THE HEAD, THE THORAX, YOU KNOW, THE LEGS, THE BUTTOCKS. - I MEAN, IT DOES HAVE - SOME DAMAGE. - IT COULD BE FROM AGE, - YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES THE OLDER TAXIDERMY WILL CRACK, - DRY OUT, - THINGS LIKE THAT. - YOU CAN SEE - IT'S STUFFED WITH STRAW. IT WAS A HOMEMADE MOUNT. - MY UNCLE MIGHT'VE - DONE IT HIMSELF. - YEAH, - THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE, - BUT HE DID - A PRETTY GOOD JOB. EARLY TAXIDERMY IS OFTEN STUFFED WITH PAPER, STRAW, OR SOME OTHER SOFT, DRY MATERIAL. THE PROBLEM WITH THIS IS THAT ANY WRINKLES OR INDENTS BECOME HARD AND TAUT LIKE A DRUM, OR END UP SPLITTING, LIKE THEY DID HERE. HE'S PRETTY SWEET, SO YOU LOOKING TO SELL OR TRADE HIM OR... I THOUGHT I WANTED TO TRADE IT, BUT I'M NOT SURE ANYTHING HERE IS GONNA BE RIGHT FOR A 3-YEAR-OLD. - I'M LOOKING TO TRADE - FOR SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE "LITTLE BO PEEP" AND A LITTLE LESS "SILENCE OF THE LAMBS." - WHAT DO YOU WANT TO - GET ON THIS? - HONESTLY, - I DON'T REALLY KNOW - WHAT THE MARKET FOR - TWO-HEADED SHEEP IS. UH-HUH. IT'S A REALLY GREAT PIECE. WE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE IT. - OF COURSE, WE HAVE TO - BUY IT TO RE-SELL IT, - SO WE CAN'T PAY YOU - FULL RETAIL ON IT. - YEAH. ALSO, IT DOES HAVE - SOME CONDITION ISSUES. I UNDERSTAND. WOULD YOU TAKE $1,000 FOR IT? YEAH. - GREAT. THANK YOU. - THANK YOU. HONESTLY, I HAD NO IDEA WHAT TO EXPECT PRICE-WISE. I KNEW THAT IT WASN'T COMING HOME WITH ME, SO I'M HAPPY WITH $1,000. WHAT'S UP, MIKE? WHAT'S UP, RYAN? HEY, WHAT'S UP, JORDY? - ACTUALLY, - SOME INTERESTING NEWS FOR YOU. SO, WE ACTUALLY TOOK IT TO SEE A FEW FRIENDS OF OURS. ONE'S A CARDIOLOGIST, - AND THE SECOND ONE IS - OUR ATTORNEY. YOUR ATTORNEY? - WHY WOULD YOU - GO TO AN ATTORNEY? WE HAD TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS LEGAL TO SELL. I HAVE TO ADMIT, I'M REALLY NERVOUS. THE FACT THAT A LAWYER WAS CALLED... OF TROUBLE OR COPS SHOW UP. JUST SOMETHING I DO NOT NEED IN MY LIFE RIGHT NOW. WE DISCOVERED THAT THIS IS NOT ANIMAL. WELL, IT'S ANIMAL. WELL, YES. BUT... AND THIS IS A BIG BUT... IT'S HUMAN. - NOT ONLY IS THIS - A HUMAN HEART, BUT IT'S SOMETHING EVEN MORE INTERESTING THAN THAT. THIS ROD IS PROBABLY THE TRAJECTORY OF A BULLET. WOW. - WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH - HUMAN ITEMS, - CLEARLY YOU WANT TO BE - ON THE UP AND UP, - YOU KNOW, ON THE CORRECT SIDE - OF THE LAW. OF COURSE. SO, WE'RE ACTUALLY GONNA GIVE OUR LAWYER A CALL, FIND OUT WHAT ELSE HE FOUND OUT ABOUT THE HEART AND TAKE IT FROM THERE. LET'S DO IT. SURE. Kuby here! - HEY, RON, - IT'S MIKE OVER AT OBSCURA. Mike! - SO, WHAT'S THE VERDICT, RON? - CAN WE BUY THE HEART? Well this is what I've come up with... the laws that govern the buying and selling of human body parts for transplant... THESE ARE REMARKABLY SPECIFIC. MM-HMM. - If it was preserved correctly - For transplant, You would be barred from selling it, and the penalty is $50,000 in fines and five years in prison. THERE ARE SOME INDIVIDUAL STATES THAT BAR SALES OF CADAVERS, THAT BAR SALES OF BODY PARTS. BUT NEW YORK ONLY PROHIBITS THE SALE OF HUMAN ORGANS AND TISSUES FOR TRANSPLANT. A human heart can survive VIABLY FOR TRANSPLANT INTO ANOTHER PERSON four to six hours. UH, WELL, THIS ONE HAS BEEN IN THIS JAR A VERY LONG TIME. I DON'T THINK IT'S VIABLE AT ALL. Good news. - Go ahead. - You're free to buy. You're free to sell. - BE HEALTHY. - TAKE CARE OF YOUR HEARTS. - EXCELLENT, RON. - ALWAYS GLAD TO HEAR IT. Bye-bye. THIS WAS GREAT NEWS. I MEAN, THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO COME INTO THIS SHOP WHO WOULD GIVE THEIR RIGHT ARM FOR A HEART LIKE THIS. AND ACCORDING TO KUBY, THAT MIGHT BE LEGAL, TOO. SO, THE BIG QUESTION IS, - WHAT WERE YOU - LOOKING TO GET, MAN? HOW ABOUT $400? IT'S A LITTLE HIGH. I WOULD ALMOST PRICE THIS AT $300, AND THEN MAYBE LIKE $50 FOR THE OTHER TWO. OOH, YOU'RE BREAKING MY HEART. IT'S KIND OF RARE. I MEAN, YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WE HAVE TO RESELL THE STUFF. $375? UM... COME ON. $400 IS PROBABLY A LITTLE TOO HIGH. $350 IS RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE. AROUND THERE. - I THINK $350 WILL STILL - MY BEATING HEART. EXCELLENT. DONE DEAL. - THANKS GUYS. - I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT'S GONNA WALK THROUGH THE DOOR AT OUR STORE. - I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT MAKES - THIS PLACE SO SPECIAL. WHEN JORDY CAME IN, HE THOUGHT HE HAD A PICKLED PIG HEART. - THIS IS REALLY GOOD NEWS - FOR JORDY, - AND IT'S EXCELLENT NEWS - FOR OBSCURA. - CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY - DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS
