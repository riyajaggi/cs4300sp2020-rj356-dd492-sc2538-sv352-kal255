 YOU HAD CALLED. YOU HAD MENTIONED THAT YOU HAD SOMETHING FOR ME. IT'S BEAUTIFUL. IT CAME IN, WE PUT IT ASIDE, CALLED YOU FIRST. WHERE IS IT? WHERE IS IT? I'LL BRING IT UP. I'D BEEN A PROFESSIONAL WRESTLER BACK IN THE '80s. MY GRANDFATHER, HE DEVELOPED THE FIRST TV-DINNER TRAY. SO, IN A WAY, I HELPED TO FEED BILLIONS OF PEOPLE A DAY. THIS PIECE IS REALLY COOL. WOW! NOW, THIS ONE'S KIND OF UNUSUAL. THIS PIECE WOULD SIT ON THE COUNTER IN A DRUGSTORE. YOU'D PUT YOUR PENNY IN HERE, HOLD THESE TWO KNOBS, AND AS YOU TURN IT, IT STARTS GIVING YOU SHOCKS. THE IDEA WAS YOU'D PASS ELECTRICITY THROUGH YOU, AND IT WOULD CURE WHATEVER YOU GOT. OH, COME ON. HERE IT SAYS, "CURES HEADACHE, NEURALGIA, RHEUMATISM," WHICH IS ARTHRITIS. YOU THINK IT WORKS? IT ACTUALLY DOES. YOU WANT TO TRY IT? UNH. YEAH. A LITTLE SENSATION THERE. HOW'S YOUR HEADACHE? OW! GOD! ARE YOU OKAY? I GOT TO HAVE IT, MAN! NO, THIS IS SO COOL, SERIOUSLY. WOULD YOU EVER GO UP THAT HIGH? NO. NO. IT'D BE CRAZY TO DO THAT. I LOVE IT. WHAT ARE YOU ASKING FOR IT? WE ORIGINALLY WERE TO PUT ABOUT $1,300 ON THIS. ALTHOUGH YOU'RE A GOOD CUSTOMER. YOU BUY A LOT. I WOULD DROP THIS DOWN TO A GRAND FOR YOU. SOLD. GREAT, MAN. THE FORGOTTEN ONE, JACKSON. YEAH. I'M TRYING TO REMEMBER HIM. HOW YOU DOING? HI. JUST ASK IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. GREAT. YOU KNOW, IF THERE'S ANYTHING SPECIFIC YOU'RE LOOKING FOR, WE COULD... YEAH. I'M LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TO SORT OF RECLAIM MY MASCULINITY. GEEZ. I KNOW. SOUNDS HEAVY. SO, MASCULINE? YEAH, SOMETHING THAT'S OBVIOUSLY MALE. WELL, WE HAD THESE... IT'S CALLED AN OOSIK. IT'S ACTUALLY THE PENIS BONE OF A WALRUS ABOUT, OH, TWO FEET LONG. WOW. YEAH, I'M NOT SO MUCH IN THE PENIS DIRECTION, MORE IN THE, YOU KNOW... THE GONAD? YEAH. YEAH. THE BOYS, HUH? IN THE TWO FRIENDS IN THE APARTMENT DOWNSTAIRS. OOH, WOW. WE DO HAVE SOMETHING ACTUALLY HERE. I'M LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TO BRING OUT THE MAN TIGER WITHIN ME. SOMETHING DEEP WITHIN THAT SCREAMS, "I'M A MAN." IT'S THE AESTHETIC THAT I'M LOOKING FOR TO REALLY SPEAK VOLUMES FOR MY MANLINESS. WELL, WE HAVE THESE ACTUALLY LABELED "MALE GLANDS." MIXED. AND "ORCHIC SUBSTANCE." ALSO, IT SAYS ON IT "DESICCATED TESTICULAR SUBSTANCE." AND THESE ARE USUALLY THE TESTICLES AND GLANDS OF ANIMALS THAT WERE GROUND UP AND DESICCATED OR DRIED OUT AND USED FOR MEDICINAL PURPOSES. WHAT YEAR IS THAT GROUND-UP TESTICLE FROM? '20s, '30s, GIVE OR TAKE. THAT'S A HERBERT HOOVER GROUND-UP TESTICLE. THAT'S ACTUALLY SPOT ON, IT'S JUST NOT IN THE GROUND-UP FORM. YOU SEE, I ONLY HAVE ONE TESTICLE. AND I WOULD WANT A FULL ONE. IS THAT A BIRTH-DEFECT THING OR MEDICAL? NO, I'M ACTUALLY GETTING OVER TREATMENT FOR TESTICULAR CANCER. OH, REALLY? YEAH. I JUST GOT THROUGH MY CHEMOTHERAPY TREATMENTS. CONGRATULATIONS. THANK YOU. I'VE BEEN THROUGH SEVERAL ROUNDS OF CHEMO MYSELF, LOST ALL MY HAIR. YEAH. YOU UNDERSTAND. DID YOU GET THAT HEALTHY GLOW? YES. I DID GET THE HEALTHY GLOW. ISN'T THAT STRANGE? AND THEN I GOT THE ACNE THAT COMES AFTER THE HEALTHY GLOW. NOT SO HEALTHY. OR THE QUESTIONS THAT PEOPLE ASK, LIKE "WHY DO YOU STILL HAVE YOUR EYEBROWS?" I DIDN'T WRITE THE BOOK ON CHEMO. I DON'T KNOW. IT'S JUST THERE. I DIDN'T PULL 'EM OUT. RIGHT. RIGHT. HUH! WELL, THAT'S KIND OF A TALL ORDER. I MEAN, WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING RIGHT NOW, BUT IF YOU CAN GIVE US A COUPLE OF DAYS, WE CAN PROBABLY TURN SOMETHING UP. ALSO, WHAT KIND OF BUDGET YOU WORKING WITH HERE? MY BUDGET CAN'T GO THROUGH THE ROOF, BUT THIS IS ALSO GONNA BE SOMETHING THAT I'M GONNA USE FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE TO TALK ABOUT A VERY IMPORTANT MOMENT. I'M WILLING TO SPEND A LITTLE SOMETHING EXTRA. GIVE US A LITTLE TIME. WE'LL SEE WHAT WE CAN COME UP WITH. I APPRECIATE IT. TAKE CARE, GUYS. THIS WILL BE FUN. FUN. HEY, WHAT'S UP, TIM? HEY, RYAN. HOW YOU BEEN, MAN? GOOD TO SEE YOU. GOOD SEEING YOU AGAIN. WHAT'S NEW AND EXCITING? THAT WAS THE WORST HANDSHAKE EVER. I COLLECT EARLY ANTIQUE ELECTRICAL, MEDICAL, VACUUM TUBE GEAR. I'VE BEEN GOING TO OBSCURA FOR A WHILE. WE'RE FRIENDS AND COMPETITORS. WE'RE ALWAYS RUNNING INTO EACH OTHER AT MARKETS OR GOING AFTER THE SAME TRADE OR BUYING BACK AND FORTH. I GOT A SMALL PIECE. IT'S ELECTRICAL, BUT IT'S ALSO MORE MEDICAL, BEAUTICIAN, I GUESS YOU COULD CALL IT. AND I WAS WONDERING WHETHER OR NOT YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED. I'D LOVE TO SEE WHAT YOU HAVE. YOU ALWAYS HAVE REALLY GOOD STUFF. AHH. NICE LITTLE BOXED PIECE. YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT'S UNDER THESE BLACK BOXES. OH, WHOA! WHAT THE HECK IS THAT? THERE IS THIS ONE THING THAT I HAVE THAT MIGHT BE INTERESTING RIGHT HERE. THAT'S SUBTLE. WHAT IS THAT? I KNOW YOU WERE TELLING ME ABOUT THIS GIANT PIECE OF MACHINERY THAT YOU HAVE. COME ON BACK. JUST WATCH YOUR STEP. HERE IT IS. OH, WOW! THIS IS "ODDITIES." - HEY, WHAT'S UP, TIM? - HEY, RYAN. I GOT A SMALL PIECE, AND I WAS WONDERING WHETHER OR NOT YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED. OKAY. AHH. A NICE LITTLE BOXED PIECE. YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT'S UNDER THESE BLACK BOXES. OH, WHOA! WHAT THE HECK IS THAT? IT'S AN EARLY ELECTROLYSIS MACHINE. REALLY? YEAH, FOR KILLING HAIR FOLLICLES. AHH. IT'S A HAIR-REMOVAL KIT FOR A SALON. YOU TAKE WHAT'S KNOWN AS A FILAMENT NEEDLE, AND YOU PUT IT INTO YOUR HAIR FOLLICLE. ELECTROMAGNETIC ENERGY FLOWS THROUGH THIS THING AND DESTROYS THAT AREA. ONCE THAT'S DESTROYED, THERE'S NO MORE HAIR GROWTH. ELECTROLYSIS WAS ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR FORMS OF HAIR REMOVAL UNTIL ABOUT THE 1990s, WHEN LASER TREATMENTS BECAME VERY, VERY POPULAR. HOWEVER, ELECTROLYSIS IS STILL USED TODAY, AS IT'S THE ONLY TREATMENT THAT ACTUALLY STOPS HAIR GROWTH, WHEREAS LASER TREATMENTS JUST SLOW IT DOWN. REALLY, ALL YOU'RE FEELING WHEN YOU'RE GETTING THIS TYPE OF REMOVAL IS ELECTRIC ENERGY. WHICH CAN BE, I GUESS, RELATIVELY UNCOMFORTABLE. DEPENDS ON YOUR POINT OF VIEW. IT'S NOT SUCH A BAD THING. YEAH, I'VE BEEN SHOCKED, MAN. I DON'T LIKE THAT FEELING TOO WELL. I THINK IT'S OKAY. ANY IDEA WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING TO GET FOR IT? UH, HOW ABOUT $150. OH, I MEAN, QUITE HONESTLY, THAT'S PRETTY CLOSE TO WHAT WE'D CHARGE FOR IT HERE. YOU WOULD SELL FOR IT? I WAS THINKING BETWEEN, LIKE, $50 AND $75 OR SOMETHING. UH... THAT'D BE TOUGH. YEAH? ANY OTHER WAY YOU CAN SWEETEN THE DEAL? UM... HOW ABOUT THIS? I KNOW THIS GUY WHOSE FATHER WAS A PHYSICIST, RIGHT? AND HE HAS A LOT OF EARLY ELECTRIC STUFF. BUT HE SAID SOMETHING ABOUT A TUBE TESTER. OH, REALLY? HE HAD OSCILLOSCOPES. YOU COULD COME CHECK IT OUT, AND MAYBE I CAN HELP BROKER THE DEAL IF YOU LET ME HAVE THIS FOR 75 BUCKS. THAT'D BE THE DEAL. IF I LIKE WHAT I SEE, YOU'VE GOT A DEAL. ALL RIGHT, MAN. THANKS. COOL. THANKS, TIM. THAT'S A COOL PIECE. WE'RE ON A MISSION FOR A VERY SPECIAL CUSTOMER. HE'S LOOKING FOR AN ITEM THAT REPRESENTS HIS MASCULINITY, WHICH IS NOT AN EASY TASK. SO, WE'RE GONNA VISIT TONY, WHO HAS QUITE THE COLLECTION. WE JUST HOPE HE HAS SOMETHING MAN ENOUGH. HELLO. COME ON IN. HEY, NICE PLACE. THANK YOU. IT'S PRETTY IMPRESSIVE. WOW! YEAH, THIS IS MY TOY COLLECTION. AMAZING. YEAH. THAT'S KIND OF NEAT. AS WE MOVE, WE GET THAT EVIL-ZOMBIE THING GOING ON. YEAH. I WAS WONDERING IF IT'S AN ORIGINAL, 'CAUSE SHE LOOKS AUTHENTIC. I'M AN ARTIST AND A HAIR STYLIST, MAKEUP ARTIST. I FIND THESE INTERESTING, FUN PIECES AT GARAGE SALES AND TURN THEM INTO SOMETHING ELSE. WHEN I FIND SOMETHING DEAD, I USUALLY USE THEM IN ART. MAKES ME HAPPY. THERE IS THIS ONE THING THAT I HAVE THAT MIGHT BE INTERESTING RIGHT HERE. THIS IS AN OLD STRENGTH-MEASURING MACHINE. WOW! THAT'S PRETTY COOL. THIS IS ACTUALLY A REAL MEDICAL DEVICE. THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN USED TO ACTUALLY CALIBRATE MAYBE SOMEONE AFTER THEY HAD AN ACCIDENT. WOW. OKAY. I SEE. AS IT GOES, IT STOPS WHERE YOUR HIGHEST PRESSURE IS, AND THIS JUST SHOWS WHERE YOU ARE CURRENTLY. IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU HAVE FOR SALE? ACTUALLY, I THINK I MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING SPOT ON, SOMETHING THAT'S VERY ODD. OH, PERFECT. SURE. YEAH, RIGHT HERE. HMM. WHAT? WHAT IS THAT? THAT'S SUBTLE. IT'S A BULLET ANT FROM SOUTH AMERICA. OH, MY GOSH. THAT IS A BIG... ANT. IT'S HUGE, THAT THING. THESE GUYS WERE ACTUALLY A TEST OF MANHOOD. BULLET ANTS ARE SAID TO HAVE THE MOST PAINFUL INSECT STING IN THE WORLD, SIMILAR TO BEING SHOT WITH A BULLET. THE PAIN IS SAID TO BE ALL-CONSUMING AND LASTS UP TO 24 HOURS. THERE'S A TRIBE IN BRAZIL WHERE THEY HAVE AN ENTIRE RITUAL ASSOCIATED WITH THIS THAT'S ACTUALLY QUITE BRUTAL. THEY DO. WHAT THEY DO TO PROVE MANHOOD, THEY'LL PUT A BUNCH OF ANTS IN A GLOVE. THE PERSON'S SUPPOSED TO WEAR IT AS LONG AS THEY CAN. THEY'RE DANCING AND SINGING, BUT THE WHOLE TIME, HE'S BEING STUNG REPEATEDLY. NOTHING SAYS MANHOOD LIKE BEING STUNG BY GIANT ANTS. WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO PART WITH YOUR ANT? UM, YOU KNOW, I'D PROBABLY PART WITH HIM FOR, LIKE, MAYBE $35. OH. THAT'LL DEFINITELY WORK. YEAH. YEAH. IT'S KIND OF PERFECT. THANKS! YOU'RE WELCOME. I DO ACTUALLY HAVE SOMETHING. OH, HERE IT IS. WHAT IS THAT? I'M EXCITED TO SEE WHAT YOU GUYS FOUND. WE LITERALLY RECLAIMED A MANHOOD. OH! THIS IS "ODDITIES." TIM RECENTLY CAME TO THE SHOP LOOKING TO SELL AN OLD ELECTROLYSIS MACHINE. THE PRICE WAS A LITTLE TOO HIGH, BUT I GAVE A DISCOUNT IN EXCHANGE FOR A FINDER'S FEE ON ANOTHER ITEM. HEY, GUYS. HEY, BOB. GOOD TO SEE YOU, MAN. SO, I'M AT MY FRIEND BOB'S, WHO'S AGREED TO SHOW US AN ANTIQUE TUBE TESTING DEVICE HE GOT FROM HIS FATHER. LET'S CHECK IT OUT. GREAT. COME ON BACK. JUST WATCH YOUR STEP. OKAY. THIS WAS THE OLD WORKBENCH, AND THIS WAS THE OLD ELECTRONICS BENCH. OH, WOW! THAT'S PRETTY AMAZING. YOUR FATHER BUILT THIS? HE DID. WOW! THAT'S A BEAUTY. THIS BENCH WAS BASICALLY STATE-OF-THE-ART BACK IN THE DAY. IT HAD ONE OF THE FIRST BATTERY CHARGERS. SO, MY TOYS, MY BATTERY WOULD DRAIN OUT. THESE WEREN'T RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES. BUT THAT DEVICE ON THAT BENCH COULD RECHARGE A STANDARD BATTERY. IT WAS AWESOME. NEVER HAD TO BUY BATTERIES. YOU'VE GOT EVERYTHING YOU WOULD NEED HERE. YOU'VE GOT AN OSCILLOSCOPE, SIGNAL GENERATORS OVER HERE, LINE VOLTAGE MONITORS. THAT'S A PRETTY COMPLETE WORKBENCH. THERE'S A TUBE TESTER INVOLVED HERE, TOO. ABSOLUTELY, RIGHT OVER HERE. FANTASTIC! YOU'D PLUG IN THE TUBE INTO ONE OF THESE, AND THIS ACTUALLY TESTS WHETHER... WELL, LIKE THIS, IT READS "BAD" AND "GOOD." YOU CAN GO ONE OF TWO WAYS. IN A VACUUM TUBE, A NEGATIVELY CHARGED THREADLIKE STRUCTURE OTHERWISE KNOWN AS A FILAMENT GIVES OFF ELECTRONS FROM THE TUBE'S CENTER. THESE NEGATIVELY CHARGED ELECTRONS THEN FLOW TO THE POSITIVELY CHARGED SIDE OF THE TUBE, WHICH CAUSES THESE ENERGIES TO CREATE AN ELECTRICAL CURRENT. BEFORE TRANSISTORS WIDELY REPLACED VACUUM TUBES, TESTERS LIKE THIS ONE WERE USED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FILAMENT INSIDE OF THE TUBE WAS STILL IN WORKING CONDITION. I BROUGHT A PIECE WITH ME. I WAS WONDERING IF WE COULD CHECK IT OUT. DO YOUR THING, MAN. THIS IS THE PIECE THAT I BROUGHT. THIS WAS AN AMPLIFIER USED IN THE EARLY A.M. TRANSMITTERS, YOU KNOW, IN THE BEGINNING DAYS OF A.M. RADIO. IF YOU HAVE A TV BUILT OUT OF THESE, IT WOULD HAVE FILLED UP YOUR ENTIRE GARAGE. SO, CAN I TRY IT OUT? ABSOLUTELY. ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO FOR IT. INTERESTED TO SEE WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN. AND IT LIGHTS UP. AND IT WORKS. IT HAPPENS TO BE GOOD. I THINK WE'VE GOT A PRETTY GOOD TEST APPARATUS. SO, BOB, WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED IN JUST SELLING THE TUBE CHECKER? WELL, TO TELL YOU WHAT I'M LOOKING AT IS TO SELL THE WHOLE THING AS ONE COMPLETE PACKAGE. OKAY. BECAUSE EACH APPARATUS KIND OF FEEDS INTO THE OTHER. I'D GO FOR THE WHOLE THING. I'M INTERESTED. OH, REALLY? YEAH. IF YOU CAN DO $500, WE'LL TAKE IT OUT OF HERE. $500? WHAT DO YOU THINK, MAN? WE HAVE A DEAL. THAT'S FANTASTIC. ALL RIGHT, COOL, MAN. FANTASTIC. AND DO WE HAVE A DEAL ON THAT ELECTROLYSIS MACHINE? ABSOLUTELY. ALL RIGHT. COOL. ALL RIGHT. JUST MAKING SURE. RECENTLY, A CUSTOMER CAME TO THE SHOP WHO WAS SUFFERING FROM A VERY SERIOUS ILLNESS. AS PART OF THE HEALING PROCESS, HE ACTUALLY WANTS TO FIND SOMETHING THAT REPRESENTS MASCULINITY. SO FAR, WE'VE FOUND A BULLET ANT, BUT WE WANT SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT MORE VISCERAL. SO, WE'RE GONNA VISIT WITH A COLLECTOR. SHE SAYS SHE HAS SOME MASCULINE ITEMS THAT JUST MIGHT WORK FOR US. GOOD TO SEE YOU. COME ON IN. OH, YEAH. WELL... THAT IS QUITE A BIT OF STUFF. BEAUTIFULLY DISPLAYED. OH, THANK YOU. I MOSTLY LIKE TO COLLECT SKULLS AND SOME INSECTS, AS WELL. I HAVE DONE SOME TAXIDERMY. A LOT OF IT SMELLS BAD. I DON'T WANT TO OFFEND THE NEIGHBORS. THIS IS GREAT STUFF. ANYTHING YOU'D RECOMMEND IN YOUR COLLECTION THAT WOULD BE SORT OF MANLY? UM, I DO HAVE THESE TEETH. OH, THOSE ARE NEAT. TEETH? WHAT KIND OF TEETH ARE THEY? WHALE TEETH. THERE'S AN ANTIQUE KILLER-WHALE TOOTH. REALLY? HUH. WELL, THIS IS ALONG THE RIGHT LINES. IN MANY CULTURES, TEETH, PARTICULARLY WHALE TEETH, ARE VERY SIGNIFICANT. THEY MAKE THEM INTO JEWELRY, THEY CARVE THEM. THEY'RE HUNTING TOKENS. IT'S SORT OF A PASSAGE INTO MANHOOD. YEAH, THESE TEETH ARE REALLY GREAT, BUT HE ACTUALLY HAD TESTICULAR CANCER. AND HE JUST WANTED SOMETHING SPECIFIC TO THAT PARTICULAR DISEASE THAT COULD START A CONVERSATION ABOUT IT. UM, I DO ACTUALLY HAVE SOMETHING THAT I'VE KEPT HIDDEN. WHY DO YOU KEEP IT HIDDEN? UM, I'M AFRAID THE CATS ARE GONNA GET TO IT. OH, HERE IT IS. WHAT IS THAT? THIS IS "ODDITIES." ANYTHING YOU'D RECOMMEND IN YOUR COLLECTION THAT WOULD BE SORT OF MANLY? I DO ACTUALLY HAVE SOMETHING THAT I'VE KEPT HIDDEN. WHY DO YOU KEEP IT HIDDEN? UM, I'M AFRAID THE CATS ARE GONNA GET TO IT. OH, HERE IT IS. HERE YOU GO. WHAT IS THAT? IT'S A HUMAN TESTICLE. WELL, NOTHING SAYS TESTICULAR CANCER LIKE A TESTICLE. CAN WE TAKE A LOOK AT THAT? THAT'S AMAZING. UH-HUH. IT DOES KIND OF RESEMBLE A HARD-BOILED EGG OF SORTS. IT DOES. IT'S A LITTLE CREEPY. YEAH. IT'S A NICE SIZE, TOO. YEAH. AMONGST PRIMATES, HUMANS HAVE MIDSIZED TESTICLES. GORILLAS, HUGE ANIMALS, THEIR TESTICLES ARE ACTUALLY SMALLER. AND CHIMPANZEES ARE LARGER. IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH HOW MANY MATES THE CHIMP CAN POSSIBLY HAVE. AND ALSO, YOU KNOW, THE THING ABOUT LOOKING AT TESTICLES IS THEY JUST HANG OUTSIDE THE BODY. THE REASON FOR THAT IS TO PRODUCE SPERMATOZOA, THEY HAVE TO BE COOLER THAN YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE. SO THEY'RE EXTERNAL. THEY'RE VERY EXPOSED. JUST FLAPPING IN THE BREEZE, YEAH. IT'S NOT THE BEST DESIGN. NO, I WOULDN'T THINK SO. SO, WHAT ARE YOU ASKING FOR THIS FINE SPECIMEN? I CAN DO $175. THAT'S DEFINITELY WORTH IT. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU. EXCELLENT. THANK YOU. GONNA GO PUT THESE IN SOMETHING. FIND A GOOD HOME FOR THEM. TURN YOUR HEAD AND COUGH. HEY. HEY. WELCOME BACK. WELCOME BACK. THANKS, YEAH. A CUSTOMER RECENTLY CAME INTO THE SHOP LOOKING FOR SOME ITEMS THAT REPRESENT MASCULINITY. WE HUNTED HIGH AND LOW, AND WE CAME UP WITH TWO ITEMS THAT WE'RE HOPING ARE THE PERFECT PAIR. I'M EXCITED TO SEE WHAT YOU GUYS FOUND. IT'S RIGHT ON THE TABLE. THERE YOU GO. WHAT IS IT? IT'S A BULLET ANT. WOW! CAN I LOOK AT IT? OH, PLEASE DO. THIS ONE'S OBVIOUSLY DEAD, AND IT'S BEEN PINNED. IT'S AN OLD SPECIMEN. TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT IT. IT HAS THESE REALLY BIG PINCERS AND A STINGER. YEAH, THAT STINGER ACTUALLY DELIVERS THE MOST PAINFUL INSECT STING IN THE ANIMAL KINGDOM. IN SOME NATIVE CULTURES, THEY ACTUALLY MAKE THIS GLOVE LINED WITH THE STINGERS OF LIVE ANTS. AND AS A RITE OF MANHOOD, YOU STICK YOUR HAND INTO THIS GLOVE, AND THEY'LL START STINGING AND BITING YOUR HAND. AT THE END OF IT, THE BOY BECOMES A MAN. THIS... YEAH. I... I WAS... I DON'T KNOW. I WAS KIND OF HALF-EXPECTING THAT YOU GUYS WOULD GO IN A GROSS DIRECTION. WELL... YES, WHEN YOU SENT US OUT TO RECLAIM MANHOOD, WE KIND OF LITERALLY RECLAIMED A MANHOOD. IT'S BEHIND THE TABLE. LET ME WHIP IT OUT. YOU SAID YOU HAD ONE REMOVED. YOU GOT YOUR REPLACEMENT. OH! MANHOOD IN A JAR. WOW! NOW, WHAT APPEARS TO BE TWO TESTICLES IS ACTUALLY ONE THAT'S BEEN BISECTED. YOU DON'T TAKE IT OUT OF THE JAR? W-WELL, YOU COULD, BUT, UH... YOU COULD. THIS IS THE WAY WE GOT IT. THIS DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE AT ALL DISEASED. THIS ONE'S PRETTY CLEAN. YOU CAN SEE THE VEINS AND THAT SORT OF THING. IT'S ALL NATURAL. LOOKS LIKE AN ARTICHOKE. TAKE A LOOK? YEAH. THIS IS AWESOME. YOU KNOW, I WANT BOTH. THEY MAKE A NICE SET. YES, A PAIR. WELL, THIS, WE'RE ASKING FOR $300. ANT WAS $75. MM-HMM. $375. SOUNDS FAIR TO ME. YOU GOT YOURSELF AN INTERESTING SET. I'M SO GLAD WE COULD MAN UP TO THE CHALLENGE. IT WASN'T EASY, BUT WE FEEL THE BULLET ANT AND THE GONAD MAKE THE PERFECT PAIR. YOU GUYS HIT IT RIGHT ON THE NAIL. I HAVE A FEELING OUR CLIENT WALKED AWAY FEELING LIKE HE GOT SOMETHING BACK. THANK YOU, GUYS.
