 HAVE A LOOK AROUND. ALL RIGHTY. ANY QUESTIONS, FEEL FREE TO ASK. UM... I'M KIND OF LOOKING FOR SOMETHING FOR MY SHOW. LET ME GUESS. YOU'RE AN ACROBAT. CLOSE. MY NAME IS SES CARNY, AND I AM ONE HALF OF EVIL CLOWNS FOR HIRE. WE ARE THE WORLD'S ONLY EVIL CLOWN EXTREME VARIETY SHOW. FIRE-EATING, HUMAN BLOCKHEAD, HAMMERING A NAIL IN YOUR FACE... THINGS LIKE THAT. SO WHAT EXACTLY IS YOUR ACT? - ACTUALLY, - I'VE GOT MY GIG BAG WITH ME. - I HAVE A SHOW TONIGHT. - DO YOU WANT TO SEE SOMETHING? ALWAYS HAPPY TO SEE AN UNUSUAL TALENT. - ABSOLUTELY. - YEAH. - I GOT ACTUALLY A PERFECT THING - TO SHOW YOU... - A QUICK WAY - TO LIGHT A CIGARETTE. - SURE. - SOUNDS INNOCENT ENOUGH. USUALLY, WE DON'T ALLOW SMOKING IN THE SHOP, - BUT MAYBE - WE'LL MAKE AN EXCEPTION. YOU GOT INSURANCE, RIGHT? THIS IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING YOU SHOULDN'T TRY AT HOME. - I MEAN, I DON'T CONDONE SMOKING, - ANYWAY, BUT... YEAH. - Mike: - I'VE LEARNED LONG AGO - THAT THE PERFORMERS - I MEET THROUGH THE SHOP - ARE HIGHLY TRAINED - PROFESSIONALS. - I KNOW IT LOOKS LIKE THEY - DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING, BUT THAT'S ALL PART OF THE ACT. DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME. THAT'S INSANE. DO YOU HAVE ANY EYEBROWS LEFT? - YOU KNOW, THE WORST PART - ABOUT THAT, THOUGH, - IS THE SMOKE FROM THE CIGARETTE, - SO LET ME PUT THIS OUT. - THAT'LL KILL YOU. - YEAH, YEAH. I DON'T SEE AN ASHTRAY. HOLD ON. - YEAH. - THAT IS... IMPRESSIVE. THAT'S THE KIND OF STUFF THAT WE DO, YOU KNOW, IN THE SHOW, SO I'M TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING - TO KIND OF FIT - ALONG THAT CALIBER. WOW. SPECIFICALLY SOMETHING THAT'S OLD, CREEPY. - THAT'S WHY I CAME HERE. - RIGHT. YOU GOT ANYTHING LIKE THAT? LIKE THIS BEAUTY RIGHT HERE. WHAT IS THIS? IT'S AN éCRASEUR. IT'S USED FOR REMOVING SOFT, HIGHLY VASCULAR TISSUE. IT WORKS BY A CRUSHING, RATHER THAN A CUTTING ACTION. WHEN YOU CUT SOFT TISSUE, - THERE'S A LOT OF BLOOD VESSELS - IN IT. - IT BLEEDS OUT. - SO THEY INVENTED THESE. IT SEVERS VERY SLOWLY, AND AS THE CHAIN CLOSES AROUND THE TISSUE, IT CLOSES OFF THE VESSELS, AND THE BLOOD CLOTS, AND YOU END UP WITH A BLOODLESS WOUND. - IF YOU WANT TO - TAKE A LOOK. - YEAH. - IF I COULD TAKE A LOOK. YOU KNOW, I'M HAVING SOME IDEAS FLOATING HERE, - BUT IS THERE ANY WAY THAT - I COULD SEE THIS ACTUALLY WORK? OH! I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. EXCUSE ME. FRUITY THING BACK THERE? I HAD TO DIG THROUGH THE GARBAGE, BUT I THINK WE HAVE JUST THE GANGRENOUS APPENDAGE. IMAGINE THIS WAS AN INFECTED PART AND THEY WANTED TO CUT IT OFF WITHOUT BLEEDING. THE OFFENDING BIT INTO THERE. - YOU TURN IT. - OW, OW. - YOU CAN SEE - IT'S A VERY SLOW ACTION. - YOU HOLD IT BY THE HANDLE THERE. - ARE YOU FEELING THAT YET? AW, YEAH. YEAH, SEE, NOW IT'S STARTING TO GRIP INTO THE FLESH. OH, THAT'S GRIPPING FLESH. - YEAH. YOU CAN SEE - IT'S STARTING TO HAPPEN. THERE YOU GO. OF COURSE. WE'VE NOW CUT THROUGH THE TISSUE. - AND AH! - LOOK AT THAT. - THERE YOU GO. - AND SEE? - LOOK AT THAT. - SEE, THE SKIN - WOULD FOLD OVER INTO THE WOUND, - AND THEN IT WOULD - JUST TAKE A FEW STITCHES. - I GOT A PERFECT IDEA FOR THAT. - I GOT TO HAVE THIS. HOW MUCH IS IT? $650. I'LL TAKE IT. $650. IT'S A DEAL. ALL RIGHT. YEAH, IT'S A DEAL. I'LL TAKE IT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THIS THING JUST LOOKS SO SLOW AND PAINFUL AND METHODICAL. I LOVE IT. - I THINK WITH THE RIGHT MUSIC - AND THE RIGHT ATMOSPHERE, IT'S GONNA KEEP THE AUDIENCE - RIGHT ON THE EDGE - OF THEIR SEATS. - HEY, KEVIN. - HOW YOU DOING? - GOOD. - HOW YOU BEEN, MIKE? - GOOD. - I'VE KNOWN MIKE - FOR QUITE A FEW YEARS. WE'VE DEALT IN THE PAST. I CAME ACROSS SOMETHING THAT YOU MIGHT LIKE. I'M AN ARTIST AND COLLECTOR. I HAVE A PIECE THAT I KNOW MIKE AND EVAN WOULD LOVE TO HAVE IN THE STORE. GOT THIS YEARS AGO FROM AN OLD CARNY. DO YOU LIKE BACON? UH, NO, BUT... AW MAN. A TWO-FACED PIG. WHAT A CUTIE. AW, MAN, JUST HEADS AND MORE HEADS. THAT'S REALLY PRETTY SWEET. - SOMETHING YOU MIGHT BE - INTERESTED IN HAVING? - THAT'S SOMETHING - I MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN. - A TWO-FACED PIG - IS ACTUALLY QUITE RARE. THEY POP UP NOW AND THEN, BUT THEY'RE REALLY HIGHLY SOUGHT AFTER. I WOULD SAY IT'S PROBABLY AT LEAST 50 YEARS OLD. DOESN'T HAVE AN ODOR OR ANYTHING. NO INSECT DAMAGE. NO. NOTHING. YEAH, THAT'S ODD. FREEZE-DRIED, YOU THINK? I'M NOT SURE. IT'S A VERY OLD PIECE. I'M NOT QUITE SURE. - 'CAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE - THERE'S A CUT HERE, - AND IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S - A LITTLE BIT OF GLUE HERE. IT LOOKS ALMOST LIKE IT WAS FREEZE-DRIED THE WAY THE MOUTH DOES. OH, ACTUALLY, THE HOLES HERE... YES. THOSE ARE PINS FOR FREEZE-DRYING. - THEY POSITION THE ANIMAL - IN PLACE, AND THEY USE THE PINS - TO KEEP HIM - ALL WHERE HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE. - AND THEY WOULD - TAKE THE ORGANS OUT, BUT THEY LEAVE ALL THE MEAT IN THERE. THEN THEY FREEZE HIM. - FREEZE-DRYING WORKS BY A PROCESS - KNOWN AS SUBLIMATION. THE ANIMAL IS PUT INTO POSITION, THEN FROZEN SOLID, THEN PUT INTO A VACUUM CHAMBER. WHEN A VACUUM'S APPLIED, THE ICE GOES FROM SOLID FORM TO GAS FORM. IT SKIPS LIQUID FORM ALTOGETHER. IF IT DID BECOME LIQUID, IT WOULD LOSE ITS SHAPE. IT COULD DECOMPOSE. IT WOULD BE A REAL MESS. I WOULD SAY WHAT DOES MAKE IT MORE SPECIAL THAN A REGULAR TAXIDERMY PIECE - IS, YOU STILL HAVE THE - WHOLE INNER SKELETON IN THERE. OH, ABSOLUTELY. - OF COURSE, - WITH TRADITIONAL TAXIDERMY, IT WOULD BE MORE DIFFICULT 'CAUSE, YOU KNOW, THE SKULL'S PARTIALLY EXPOSED HERE. THEY WOULD HAVE TO LEAVE THE WHOLE SKULL IN HERE, WHICH, OF COURSE, THEY DID WITH THIS PROCESS. SO THIS IS LIKE THE MEMBRANE, AND IF YOU WERE TO OPEN THAT UP, THE ACTUAL BRAIN, I'M SURE, WOULD BE A DRIED-OUT LITTLE WALNUT IN THERE. - IF YOU TAKE YOUR TONGUE - AND TOUCH IT, IT'S GOT A SALTY TASTE. I'LL TRUST YOU ON THAT ONE. WHY ON EARTH WOULD YOU WANT TO SELL THIS? - YOU KNOW, - I HAVE SO MUCH STUFF. IT'S JUST TIME TO MAKE ROOM FOR OTHER NEW PIECES. - WELL, HE'S GREAT. - UH... THE WORST QUESTION OF ALL... HOW MUCH? UM... I'M GONNA HAVE TO ASK $1,200 ON IT - JUST BECAUSE - OF THE RARITY OF THE PIECE. - LITTLE PIGGIES LIKE THAT - DON'T COME AROUND OFTEN. NO, NOT AT ALL. - YOU SEE THEM - MOSTLY PICKLED. - YEAH. - IS THERE ANY WIGGLE ROOM - ON THAT? - LIKE, COULD YOU DO - LIKE AN EVEN GRAND? THEN WE CAN DO CASH. I HATE TO ASK. NO, I MEAN... IF I WERE TO SELL IT TO SOMEBODY ELSE, - I WOULD DEFINITELY - ASK MORE. YEAH. BUT... I'LL DO IT FOR YOU GUYS. NOW YOU'RE COMING HOME WITH ME, LITTLE PIGGY. HEY, LAURA. - HEY, LAURA. - HOW'S IT GOING? OKAY. HOW ARE YOU? - LAURA'S ONE OF - OUR REGULAR CUSTOMERS. SHE WAS A MORTICIAN AND THEN A MODEL, AND NOW SHE'S A CLOTHING DESIGNER... AN ALL-AROUND GOOD EGG. I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY SOLD ANYTHING TO YOU, AND I STILL DON'T WANT TO PART WITH THIS, BUT IT'S A GIFT FROM AN EX. WHEN I PASS BY IT IN MY APARTMENT, IT JUST REMINDS ME OF HIM, AND I DON'T REALLY CARE FOR HIM THAT MUCH. SORRY ABOUT THAT. - NO, - THAT'S ALL RIGHT. IT SUCKS 'CAUSE IT'S GOT SO MUCH COOL STUFF IN IT. WOW. - YOU MIGHT WANT TO - PUT SOME GLOVES ON. I DIDN'T REALLY CLEAN UP. I KIND OF LEFT IT AS IT WAS. - TOXIC. - WELL, MAYBE WE WON'T - POKE AROUND TOO MUCH IN THERE. - I'LL JUST DO ONE. - YEAH, THIS IS MY FAVORITE PART - OF THE JOB. OH, YES. ALL RIGHT, WHAT ARE WE PROTECTING OURSELVES AGAINST, LAURA? CARCINOGENS. CARCINOGENS. OKAY. YEAH. HERE AT OBSCURA, WE DEAL WITH ALL SORTS OF STUFF FROM THE TURN OF THE CENTURY - BEFORE THEY REALLY CARED ABOUT - THE TOXICITY OR HOW POISONOUS AN ITEM MAY BE. - IT COULD BE ARSENIC - FROM AN OLD TAXIDERMY ITEM. IT COULD BE MERCURY OR STRYCHNINE IN A MEDICAL KIT. IT'S JUST IMPORTANT THAT WE KNOW SO THAT WE CAN LET A FUTURE BUYER KNOW. WHEN I FIRST OPENED THIS, THIS BIG CLOUD CAME OUT, AND I, LIKE, WAS CHOKING. KEPT THIS ENCASED IN A GARBAGE BAG FOR LIKE A YEAR TO LET IT SETTLE. REALLY? THE BEST GIFTS COME IN GARBAGE BAGS, CLEARLY. IS IT LOCKED? THERE YOU GO. OH, THERE YOU GO. OH, MAN. OH, WOW. HE QUIT SMOKING 10 YEARS AGO. TO CELEBRATE THE ANNIVERSARY. - RIGHT. - I HAVE A PIECE. IT'S A GREAT PIECE... I MEAN, ESPECIALLY FOR A FORMER SMOKER. ONE MOMENT, PLEASE. OH, MY WORD. Mike: THIS IS "ODDITIES." Laura: WHEN I FIRST OPENED THIS, THIS BIG COULD CAME OUT, AND I, LIKE, WAS CHOKING. KEPT THIS ENCASED IN A GARBAGE BAG FOR LIKE A YEAR TO LET IT SETTLE. REALLY? - LAURA IS ONE OF - OUR BEST CUSTOMERS. SHE USED TO BE A MODEL AND A MORTICIAN. - SHE STOPPED BY - WITH A GIFT FROM AN EX-BOYFRIEND - SHE SAID - WE MAY BE VERY INTERESTED IN. - Evan: - IS IT LOCKED? NO. - DOES IT GO LEFT-RIGHT - OR UP-DOWN? OH, THERE YOU GO. THERE YOU GO. IT'S AN EMBALMING KIT. OH, WOW. LOOK AT ALL THIS STUFF. - YEAH. - PHANTOM MORTUARY COSMETICS. UH-HUH. BEAUTIFUL NAME. I KNOW. THERE'S SOME TOE TAGS. OH, VERY NICE. - IS THERE ANYTHING PRINTED - ON THOSE, OR IS IT JUST BLANK? THEY'RE BLANK. SHORTLY AFTER DEATH, THE CELLS OF THE BODY DIE AND DECOMPOSE. BACTERIA TAKES OVER AND EVENTUALLY WILL CAUSE BLOATING TO THE POINT WHERE - THE BODY COULD ACTUALLY EXPLODE - FROM SO MUCH GAS. WHAT EMBALMING DOES IS BASICALLY REPLACE THE BLOOD WITH A CHEMICAL THAT WILL KILL ALL SORTS OF BACTERIA AND PRESERVE THE BODY. THE STUFF IS INCREDIBLY TOXIC, HOWEVER, TO LIVE PEOPLE. - Evan: - OH, THAT'S A NICE KIT. OH, THAT'S NICE. - YEAH, YOU GOT YOUR SCALPELS - WITHOUT THE BLADES. ALL YOUR FAVORITES. IS THAT A TROCAR? NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. THIS IS A DRAIN TUBE. THIS WOULD GO, IDEALLY, DOWN THE JUGULAR. OH. - AND THIS HELPS - BREAK UP THE CLOTS. - YOU DON'T WANT - THE CLOTS. VERY INTERESTING. WHAT ELSE IS DOWN THERE? EYE CAPS. OH, YEAH. EYE CAPS. - Laura: - EYE CAPS GIVES A LOOK LIKE THE EYEBALL IS STILL THERE WITH ALL THE FLUID IN IT, BECAUSE THE EYEBALLS WILL FLATTEN AS YOU DECOMPOSE. THE EYELIDS WOULD LOOK WEIRD IF THEY WERE JUST RESTING THERE AND HAD NO SHAPE TO THEM. - SO, DO YOU HAVE A DOLLAR AMOUNT - THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR? I HAVE NO IDEA. WELL, I MEAN, SOMETHING LIKE THIS, FOR US TO BUY... WE'D OFFER PROBABLY ABOUT 100 BUCKS OR SO, BUT IF YOU WANTED STORE CREDIT, - WE COULD, YEAH, DO - A LITTLE BIT BETTER, OF COURSE. DEFINITELY STORE CREDIT. - SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK, - LIKE, UH... - 150 BUCKS? - YEAH. $150? IS THAT GOOD FOR YOU? $150 STORE CREDIT? SOUNDS GOOD. - IT'S BITTERSWEET - TO GET RID OF IT, - BUT I'M TRYING - NOT TO THINK ABOUT THAT. I'M JUST TRYING TO THINK, I DON'T HAVE THE UGLY REMINDER IN MY APARTMENT. BUT IT'S NOT LIKE I'M GONNA STOP COLLECTING EMBALMING KITS OR ANYTHING. - HELLO. - Mike: - HEY, RYAN. - HEY, WHAT'S UP, - MIKE, EVAN? - HOW'S IT GOING? THERE'S NOTHING THAT GOOD AT THE MARKET TODAY. RYAN IS ONE OF OUR MAIN BUYERS. - HE BRINGS IN - ALL SORTS OF THINGS TO THE SHOP. - I MEAN, YOU NEVER KNOW - WHAT HE'S GONNA TURN UP WITH. HE IS CONSTANTLY LOOKING FOR ALL THINGS WEIRD, 24 HOURS A DAY. - NOW, THIS LITTLE GUY'S KIND OF - COOL. HE'S IN PRETTY GOOD SHAPE. - AWW. - THE TREE RAT. - YEAH, - ANOTHER LITTLE TREE RAT. I'LL THROW HIM IN HERE OR SOMETHING. WHAT'S HE GOT THERE? - A NUT? - YEAH, A WALNUT. OF COURSE HE'S GOT A NUT. THE SQUIRREL GOT THE NUT. - OH, YEAH. - YEAH. - HE'S CUTE. - YEAH, THAT'S NICE. - RIGHT? - ALL RIGHT. - THAT'S A DECENT FIND. THROW THIS OVER HERE. YEAH, YEAH, WHEREVER YOU THINK. FIGURE OUT A PLACE FOR THESE THINGS. YEAH. OH, ACTUALLY, WATCH OUT FOR OUR NEW CRITTER OVER THERE. DID YOU JUST GET THIS? YEAH, JUST RECENTLY. YOU LIKE? OH, MY GOD! - Evan: - HE HAS ISSUES. - WAIT. - HOLD ON A SECOND. HE'S INCREDIBLE. - WE THOUGHT - YOU'D LIKE THAT. IT'S A TWO-FACED PIG. AND AN ANENCEPHALIC PIG. THAT'S EVEN MORE RARE. - ANENCEPHALIC IS BASICALLY WHEN - A LARGE PORTION OF THE BRAIN, SKULL, AND SCALP ARE ABSENT AT BIRTH. AND UNFORTUNATELY, THE ANIMAL OR HUMAN DOESN'T LAST VERY LONG. TYPICALLY, YOU WOULD SEE SOMETHING LIKE THIS PRESERVED IN FORMALDEHYDE. THE MERE FACT THAT THIS PIECE IS FREEZE-DRIED, OR TAXIDERMIED, AND IT'S GOT TWO FACES... VERY, VERY SOUGHT-AFTER. REALLY BEAUTIFUL. WHAT DO YOU GOT ON IT? WELL, WE JUST GOT IT. - WE HAVEN'T REALLY - PUT A PRICE ON IT. WELL, I'M DEFINITELY INTERESTED IN THIS PIECE. - Mike: - RYAN PULLS THIS ALL THE TIME. A GREAT PIECE COMES IN, AND HE FALLS IN LOVE WITH IT. - HE WANTS IT - FOR HIS OWN COLLECTION. - IF I LET HIM - TAKE HOME EVERYTHING HE WANTED, I'D HAVE TO EMPTY SHOP. - I REALLY, REALLY - LIKE THIS PIECE. - WOULD YOU BE WILLING - TO DO A TRADE, MAYBE, - SOMETHING - THAT COVERS THE COST OF IT? IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING, YOU KNOW, OF EQUAL OR GREATER VALUE, - I MEAN, - WE COULD DO THAT. WELL, I HAVE A PIECE THAT I THINK WOULD PROBABLY WORK. - ACTUALLY, I THINK - IT WOULD BE A PERFECT TRADE. - I'VE BEEN COLLECTING - SINCE I WAS A KID, - AND I HAVE A LOT OF GREAT PIECES - IN MY PERSONAL COLLECTION. - WHAT I DON'T HAVE - IS A TWO-FACED PIG. - SO I'M PRETTY SURE - I COULD FIND SOMETHING TO TRADE MIKE AND EVAN FOR IT. I THINK. THAT'S TOTALLY FINE. - ALTHOUGH, YOU KNOW, - I DO WANT TO MOVE THIS. - IF SOMEONE COMES IN, - CASH IN HAND... I KNOW, MIKE. I'M GONNA DO THIS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. I'M PRETTY SURE I HAVE THE PERFECT THING. - EVAN, - YOU WANT TO COME WITH ME? OH, I'D LOVE TO. - RYAN HAS - A PRETTY IMPRESSIVE COLLECTION, - BUT I ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE - THAT HE CHOOSES SOMETHING THAT'S WORTH TRADING OUR LITTLE TWO-FACED PIG FOR. LET'S GO. ALL RIGHT, EVAN. SO... YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING. WHAT? UM... Mike: THIS IS "ODDITIES." RECENTLY, MIKE AND EVAN PICKED UP A TWO-FACED, FREEZE-DRIED PIG. I REALLY WANT THIS THING FOR MY COLLECTION. - AND THEY AGREED - TO DO AN EVEN TRADE IF I CAN FIND SOMETHING THEY DEEM OF EQUAL VALUE. WELCOME TO MY COLLECTION. THESE ARE SOME OF MY HUMAN SKULLS THAT I'VE ACQUIRED OVER THE YEARS. Evan: YOU'VE ACQUIRED QUITE A FEW. YEAH, YEAH. - THIS ONE - IS JUST INTERESTING TO ME - BECAUSE THE ENTIRE NASAL CAVITY - IS JUST MISSING. - RIGHT. I LOVE STUFF LIKE THAT. - IT WENT THROUGH - SOMETHING REALLY HORRIFIC - THAT I - DON'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT. - THERE ARE - ANY NUMBER OF THINGS HERE - THAT WOULD REALLY BRING IN - SOME MONEY FOR THE SHOP. IF HE PICKS THE RIGHT THING, HE MIGHT JUST GET THAT TWO-FACED PIG. - THIS IS MY DINING ROOM. - THIS IS WHERE WE USUALLY EAT. - UH-HUH. - THIS IS ONE OF - MY BIGGER CABINETS OF CURIOSITY, IF YOU WILL. THESE ARE, LIKE, SOME OF MY PARTS HUMAN SKULLS - THAT I'VE COLLECTED - THROUGH THE YEARS. THIS IS A LITTLE MANDIBLE, BUT A VERY, VERY OLD ONE. YEAH, LOOK AT THAT. LOOK HOW TINY. OH. IT'S PRETTY CUTE. - THE EYES - ARE A NICE TOUCH. - YOU LIKE THAT? - YEAH. VERY. - SORT OF - CARTOONISH-LOOKING. - YEAH. - IT LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE I KNOW. SO, RYAN, WHAT WERE YOU THINKING OF TRADING FOR THAT PIG? I ACTUALLY HAVE A PARTICULAR PIECE I WAS THINKING OF. - I CAN'T IMAGINE - WHAT YOU WANT TO PART WITH. ALL RIGHT, EVAN. SO... YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING. AH. - WHAT? - I THINK IT'S PERFECT. I THINK THAT, LIKE, VALUE-WISE, - WE'RE RIGHT AROUND - THE SAME PRICE. YEAH. BUT ISN'T THAT THE PIECE THAT YOU BEAT MIKE WITH IN THE TAXIDERMY CONTEST? YEAH. I DID. YEAH. - I GOT "BEST IN SHOW" - FOR THE TAXIDERMY COMPETITION. RIGHT. HE GOT RUNNER-UP. - Ryan: - A FEW YEARS BACK, I ENTERED THESE CATS AGAINST MIKE'S ANTIQUE VICTORIAN BIRD WHO ACTUALLY SINGS AND MOVES... BASICALLY AN AUTOMATON. AND I BEAT HIM. SO HE'S EITHER GONNA LOVE HAVING THESE PIECES IN THE SHOP - OR HE'S GONNA - BEAT ME OVER THE HEAD WITH THEM. - THE NAME - OF THIS PARTICULAR PIECE WAS CALLED "DANCICUS FIGHTICUS." DID YOU THINK THAT UP? YOU HAD TO NAME EACH PIECE. YEAH. SO THIS IS "DANCICUS FIGHTICUS" BECAUSE AS YOU CAN SEE, - IF THEY'RE IN THIS POSITION, - THEY LOOK LIKE THEY'RE FIGHTING. RIGHT. - BUT IF YOU FLIP THEM UP - THE OTHER WAY - SO THAT - THEY'RE GOING HORIZONTAL, THEY LOOK LIKE THEY ARE, IN FACT, DANCING. RIGHT. - I THINK THE NAME - MIGHT HAVE WON IT FOR YOU. PERSONALLY, I THINK THE CATS ARE A GREAT TRADE. - MIKE, ON THE OTHER HAND, - MIGHT NOT APPRECIATE BEING REMINDED THAT HE LOST THAT TAXIDERMY CONTEST TO RYAN. - I'M CURIOUS - TO SEE WHAT HE'S GONNA SAY. SORRY, GUYS. YOU'RE LEAVING MY COLLECTION. - Mike: - HEY, HOW YOU DOING? - HEY. - HOW YOU DOING TODAY? - GOOD. GOOD. - FEEL FREE TO ASK - IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. ALL RIGHT. YOU GOT A LOT OF NEAT STUFF HERE. THANK YOU. - I USED TO BE - A PHYSICS PROFESSOR, - AND MY BACKGROUND - IS ENGINEERING OF MATHEMATICS. I'VE GOT A COUPLE OF THINGS IN MIND I'M LOOKING FOR. YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT'S GONNA TURN UP AT A PLACE LIKE OBSCURA. - LOOKING FOR ANYTHING - IN PARTICULAR? - YEAH, - I HAVE A FRIEND OF MINE. HE QUIT SMOKING 10 YEARS AGO, WAS A REAL HEAVY SMOKER, - AND I'M TRYING TO GET SOMETHING - TO CELEBRATE THE ANNIVERSARY. RIGHT. - I MEAN, WE HAVE A LOT - OF MEDICAL STUFF IN HERE, LIKE THE OLD COUGH SYRUP OR CONSUMPTION CURES. YEAH. YOU KNOW, I'M LOOKING FOR SOMETHING REALLY MORE SPECIAL. - RIGHT, I WAS GONNA SAY, - WE HAVE ASHTRAYS, - BUT I DON'T KNOW IF THAT - WOULD BE A REALLY GOOD, UH... - NO. I WANT TO GET SOMETHING REALLY BIZARRE FOR HIM. I HAVE A PIECE THAT... IT'S A GREAT PIECE... I MEAN, ESPECIALLY FOR A FORMER SMOKER. CARE TO SEE IT? CERTAINLY. ONE MOMENT, PLEASE. OH, MY WORD. THAT IS ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING. Mike: THIS IS "ODDITIES." I HAVE A FRIEND OF MINE. HE QUIT SMOKING 10 YEARS AGO. - I'M TRYING TO GET SOMETHING - TO CELEBRATE THE ANNIVERSARY. RIGHT. I HAVE A PIECE THAT... IT'S A GREAT PIECE... I MEAN, ESPECIALLY FOR A FORMER SMOKER. CARE TO SEE IT? CERTAINLY. ONE MOMENT, PLEASE. OH, MY WORD. THAT IS ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING. IT'S A HUMAN LUNG. SPECTACULAR. I LOVE IT. IT'S A REALLY NEAT PIECE. YOU CAN SEE THE COLOR HERE. YOUR NORMAL LUNG TISSUE SHOULD BE SORT OF A PINK COLOR, ALMOST LIKE A BUBBLE GUM. - CERTAINLY - SHOULDN'T BE BLACK. NO. THIS PART HERE... NORMALLY, THE ALVEOLI... THEY'RE VERY SMALL AIR SACS. YEAH. I MEAN, BUT HERE ARE SOME REALLY BIG ABSCESSES IN THERE. THIS PERSON CLEARLY WAS EITHER A SMOKER - OR SOMEONE - WITH EMPHYSEMA OR, YOU KNOW, SOME OTHER SORT OF LUNG AILMENT. LITTLE AIR SACS CALLED ALVEOLI. OXYGEN PASSES THROUGH THESE THROUGH A PAPER-THIN MEMBRANE INTO YOUR BLOOD SYSTEM. - WHEN YOU SMOKE, - TAR GETS IN THERE. IT CLOGS THEM UP... BASICALLY LIKE AN AIR FILTER. - THEN YOUR WHITE BLOOD CELLS - CAN'T GET IN TO FIGHT PATHOGENS AND INFECTIONS AND SUCH. IF YOU DON'T STOP SMOKING, THIS ONLY GETS WORSE, AND EVENTUALLY, THEY'LL TOTALLY CLOG. IS THIS TOO FAR FOR YOUR FRIEND OR NOT FAR ENOUGH, PERHAPS? THIS WOULD BE APPROPRIATE. ABSOLUTELY. WHAT WOULD YOU NEED TO GET FOR THAT? I COULD DO $250 ON THIS PIECE. DEAL. WONDERFUL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. - Evan: - THANK YOU. - UH-HUH. - Mike: - HEY, GUYS. - HEY. - WHAT'S UP, MIKE? - SO, WHAT DID YOU THINK - OF THE COLLECTION? PRETTY NEAT, HUH? OH, GOD, IT'S BEAUTIFUL. - HEY. - WHAT HAPPENED TO THE PIG? - MIKE. I TOLD YOU, IF SOMEONE CAME IN, CASH IN HAND, THAT THING WAS GOING. ARE YOU SERIOUS? COME ON. WE WERE GONE FOR, LIKE, LITERALLY... WHAT?... AN HOUR? YEAH. I MEAN, SERIOUSLY, I WAS GONE FOR HOW LONG. - NO, I'M KIDDING. - I'M KIDDING YOU, MAN. LOOK. I GOT HIM HERE. HE'S A LAUGH A MINUTE. YEAH. KEEPING ME ON MY TOES. HE'S REALLY QUITE LOVELY. YEAH, HE IS QUITE LOVELY. YOU READY, DUDE? I'M READY. OKAY. WHISH! WHAT IS THIS, A FREAKIN' JOKE? - IT'S NOT A JOKE. - REALLY? - YOU KNOW THIS PIECE VERY WELL, - DON'T YOU? - YEAH, I'M A LITTLE FAMILIAR - WITH IT. AND WHAT WAS THAT STORY AGAIN? ME WINNING BEST IN SHOW. RYAN HAS A LOT OF NERVE BRINGING THESE CATS INTO MY STORE. I MEAN, I WANT TO MAKE IT HURT... JUST A LITTLE. - YOU THROW THAT TROPHY - IN... - OH, MAN. - YOU'RE GONNA - STEAL MY TROPHY? IT'S A TRADE. IT'S A FAIR TRADE. IT GIVES IT A LITTLE BACKSTORY, RYAN. YEAH, A LITTLE PROVENANCE. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT... I GOT MY CRITICAL ACCLAIM FOR THESE, - AND I REALLY - LOVE THIS PIECE. I'LL GIVE YOU THE TROPHY. IT'S FINE. THANK YOU. OH, EXCUSE ME. I BELIEVE THAT BELONGS TO ME NOW. VERY NICE. AWESOME, MAN. I'M HAPPY.
