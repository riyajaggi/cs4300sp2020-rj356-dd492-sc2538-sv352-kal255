 WELL, UNLESS YOUR GRANDMA'S A BIT OF A KOOK. IS THAT A STRAITJACKET? I'M MIKE. AND I'M EVAN. WE'VE SPENT OUR ENTIRE LIVES... COLLECTING AND DEALING... HUNTING AND PICKING... TO GET THIS BUSINESS... DOWN TO A SCIENCE. THIS IS "ODDITIES." GOOD AFTERNOON! HEY, HOW YOU DOING? GREAT. HOW ARE YOU DOING TODAY? GOOD. ANYTHING YOU'RE LOOKING FOR, OR...?

 WHAT KIND OF PIECE IS THIS? THINK "FRANKENSTEIN." I'M A MUSIC DIRECTOR, CONDUCTOR, AND PIANIST. I WAS READY TO GIVE UP PIANO LESSONS AS I WAS NEARING PUBERTY, TILL I DISCOVERED THAT ACCOMPANYING THE GIRLS' CHOIR AT MY LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL WAS A PRETTY AWESOME THING. THE COOL FACTOR'S THROUGH THE ROOF WITH THIS THING. OH, WOW. A JACOB'S LADDER. MM-HMM. VERY NICE. THIS REALLY DEMONSTRATES THE ARC OF ELECTRICITY. IT'S BEAUTIFUL, BUT THEY CAN BE A LITTLE DANGEROUS. WHAT HAPPENS IS ELECTRICITY JUMPS THIS LITTLE GAP HERE, AND THEN IT STARTS GOING UP AND AS IT GETS WIDER AND WIDER, THE ARC GETS WIDER AND WIDER. AS IT GOES UP, IT GETS TOO FAR AND BREAKS IT... I DON'T THINK THERE'S REALLY AN APPLICATION FOR THESE THINGS IN SCIENTIFIC LABORATORIES, BUT IT'S PRETTY NEAT TO BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY SEE IT. JACOB'S LADDERS ARE MEANT MORE FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES. THEY COME IN DIFFERENT SIZES, DIFFERENT COLORS, DIFFERENT SHAPES. HOWEVER, THERE ARE PRACTICAL USES FOR AN ELECTRIC SPARK JUMPING A GAP... THEY'RE USED IN IGNITION SYSTEMS, THEY'RE USED IN SPARK PLUGS. ACTUALLY, EVEN EARLY RADIO SIGNALS USED THIS, AS WELL. IT STILL WORKS? YEAH. WE COULD PLUG IT IN AND TRY. YEAH. LET ME GET IN THERE. ALL RIGHT. YOU READY? YEP. JUST HERE? THERE WE GO. WOW! IT'S ALIVE! IT'S ALIVE! ONE OF THE COOL THINGS... WITH A PENCIL, YOU CAN ACTUALLY STOP IT. OF COURSE, YOU DON'T WANT TO TOUCH THE METAL PART, YOU DON'T WANT TO USE A WET PENCIL, NOTHING METAL. THEN YOU CONDUCT THE ELECTRICITY. CORRECT, ALTHOUGH THERE'S SO MUCH POWER IN THERE, IT CAN LIGHT YOUR PENCIL ON FIRE. IF YOU PUT IT IN HERE... OH, WOW. YEAH. JUST IMAGINE WHAT IT WOULD DO TO YOUR FINGER OR, YOU KNOW, SOMETHING LIKE THAT. AH! DON'T DO THAT. I THINK MAYBE I SHOULD TURN THIS THING OFF BEFORE I GET IN TROUBLE. SO, WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO SELL THIS PIECE? I DON'T HAVE THE SPACE FOR AN ITEM LIKE THIS. HOW MUCH ARE YOU ASKING ON THIS THING? I'D REALLY LIKE TO GET 200 BUCKS FOR IT. UM... IT'S A NICE ITEM AND I DO LIKE IT, BUT I DO STILL HAVE TO DO SOME WORK ON IT TO MAKE IT SELLABLE. FIRST AND FOREMOST, I WOULD GET A GLASS DOME FOR THIS THING THAT WILL COVER IT, MAKE IT A LITTLE SAFER. HONESTLY, I'D PROBABLY BE MORE INTO ABOUT 100 BUCKS. I REALIZE IT'S HALF OF WHAT YOU'RE ASKING. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT $150? WANT TO SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE AT $125? I THINK YOU COULD HAVE YOURSELF A DEAL WITH THAT. EXCELLENT. THANK YOU, MAN. APPRECIATE IT, MAN. YOU BET. HEY, WHAT'S UP, NATTY? HEY, RYAN, HOW'S IT GOING? WHAT'S GOING ON? GOOD TO SEE YOU. GOOD TO SEE YOU, MAN. WHAT'S UP WITH YOU? WELL, I ACTUALLY... I'M STILL WORKING ON THE BOOK, STILL FIGURING OUT THE BIG PICTURE, YEAH. WHAT'S GONNA BE THE OVERALL PREMISE OF THAT? WELL, IT'S BASICALLY A HISTORY... ABOUT 200 YEARS OF HISTORY... OF DANDIES. OKAY. I'M A WRITER, CURRENTLY WORKING ON A BOOK ABOUT DANDIES... ECCENTRIC, WELL-DRESSED MEN THROUGH HISTORY. AND I'M ALSO A MANAGER AT THE AGAINST NATURE MENSWEAR SHOP, WHERE WE SELL SOME OF RYAN'S JEWELRY. I WANT SOMETHING, MAYBE TO KEEP ON MY WRITING DESK, MAYBE SOME SORT OF MEMENTO MORI TO TELL ME NOT TO WASTE ANY TIME. SO, YOU'RE LOOKING FOR, LIKE, A SKULL OR SOMETHING? ACTUALLY, I WAS HOPING FOR SOMETHING A LITTLE RARER. I WAS KIND OF HOPING YOU MIGHT HAVE A SHRUNKEN HEAD. A SHRUNKEN HEAD, NATTY?! WE DON'T GET THEM VERY OFTEN, BUT WE DO HAVE ONE. REALLY? I COULD SHOW IT TO YOU. I'D LOVE TO SEE IT. COOL, MAN. I CAN HOOK YOU UP, SON. WOW. FEAST YOUR EYES ON THIS GUY. THAT IS AMAZING. THIS IS A REALLY FINE HUMAN ONE. IT CAME FROM A REALLY WELL-KNOWN AUCTION. HE'S EVEN GOT A MUSTACHE LIKE MINE. YEAH. LIKE, THAT LITTLE SEATTLE GOATEE. YEAH, HE'S GOT A LITTLE SOUL PATCH THERE. THAT'S PRETTY COOL. YEAH. WHAT'S THE STORY BEHIND IT? THIS IS A TOURIST-TRADE HEAD, DONE BY THE JIVARO TRIBE. PRE-COLUMBIAN TIMES, MAN. WHEN THEY'D GO AND SLAY A VICTIM, THEY WOULD CUT THE HEADS OFF OF THEIR ENEMIES AND TAKE THE HEADS BACK TO THEIR VILLAGE. THEN THEY WOULD MAKE AN INCISION ON THE CROWN OF THE HEAD DOWN TO THE NECK AND REMOVE ALL THE SKIN FROM THE HEAD. WHEN PEOPLE THINK OF A SHRUNKEN HEAD, THEY THINK IT'S A HEAD THAT'S CUT OFF OF SOMEONE, EVERYTHING IS JUST SOMEHOW, MYSTERIOUSLY, MAGICALLY SHRUNK INTO THIS LITTLE, TINY THING. BUT THERE'S ACTUALLY NO SKULL INSIDE OF THERE. IN ORDER TO SHRINK A HEAD, THE JIVARO WOULD TAKE THE SKIN AND PLACE IT IN HOT WATER AND THEN DRY IT TO BASICALLY START THE PROCESS. AFTER THAT, HOT ROCKS AND SAND WERE PLACED INTO THE CAVITY OF THE HEAD TO FURTHER SHRINK IT. FINALLY, THEY WOULD PUT IT NEAR AN OPEN FLAME TO HARDEN THE SKIN. THIS PRACTICE WAS USED ON ENEMIES' HEADS FOR TRIBAL CEREMONIES, BUT ALSO FOR THE HEADS THEY USED FOR TRADE. OH, THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING. IF THE PRICE IS RIGHT, THEN I WOULD LOVE TO, YOU KNOW... THEY'RE NOT CHEAP, NATTY. THIS ONE WE HAVE $5,000 ON. YEAH, I THINK THAT'S... OUT OF MY BUDGET. DON'T LET THE THREE-PIECE SUITS FOOL YOU. BENEATH THIS POCKET SQUARE BEATS THE WALLET OF A STRUGGLING WRITER, SO... I HEAR YOU, MAN. WELL, WHAT IS YOUR BUDGET? BUDGET IS ABOUT HALF THAT, I'D SAY... $2,000. $2,500 MAYBE. OKAY. YOU KNOW WHAT I COULD PROBABLY DO? I MIGHT BE ABLE TO MAKE ONE. REALLY? POSSIBLY. I'VE ALWAYS BEEN VERY INTERESTED IN THE PROCESS. I MEAN, I DON'T THINK I COULD FIND A HUMAN HEAD. RIGHT. I WOULD HOPE NOT. WELL, YOU KNOW I LIKE EVERYTHING MADE FOR ME, SO I THINK THE IDEA IS PRETTY APPEALING. WELL, FIRST OFF, I NEED TO GO FIND A HEAD TO SHRINK. OKAY. MAYBE A PRIMATE HEAD OR AN ANIMAL? YEAH. IT SOUNDS GREAT. I'LL GO POKE AROUND, SEE WHAT I CAN FIND, AND GET BACK TO YOU. THAT SOUNDS EXCELLENT. ALL RIGHT. WE'LL BE IN TOUCH. EXCELLENT. GOOD TO SEE YOU, MAN. THANK YOU. - GOOD MORNING. - HELLO. HOW ARE YOU? JUST ASK IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. ACTUALLY, I HAVE THIS ITEM THAT I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU'D BE INTERESTED IN. OH, SURE. IT'S FROM THE '40s. MY FATHER USED TO WORK AT YALE. HE WAS A MACHINIST, AND WHEN HIS DEPARTMENT CLOSED DOWN THEY JUST GAVE THIS TO HIM. WELL, SURE. I'D LOVE TO TAKE A LOOK. I CAN'T IMAGINE... IT'S BEEN IN THE ATTIC FOR 30 YEARS. SO, I DUG IT OUT AND HERE I AM. I FEEL THAT IT STILL HAS SOME BLOOD ON IT. I THINK THAT'S PRETTY COOL. IT'S GRUESOME. VERY GRUESOME. MM, LOOKS LIKE A NICE, OLD BOX. OH. I... WHAT? WHAT IS THAT? CAN I TRY THIS ONE? SURE! CAREFUL. LOOK AT THAT! WHERE'S HE GOING? THE BIRD AND THE DOG ARE STILL HERE, SO THAT'S A GOOD SIGN. IT'S COLLATERAL. WOW. THIS IS REALLY NICE. IS THIS THAT CAT THAT YOU WERE TELLING ME ABOUT? YEAH. I MADE IT FOR A SHOW THAT WAS ABOUT CATS AND MONEY. THIS IS "ODDITIES." ACTUALLY, I HAVE THIS ITEM THAT I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU'D BE INTERESTED IN. OH, SURE. MM, LOOKS LIKE A NICE, OLD BOX. OH. I... WHAT? WHAT IS THAT? IT'S CALLED A PADGETT-HOOD DERMATOME. OH, IT'S A DERMATOME. WOW. BASICALLY, IT'S A SKIN SLICER. THEY TAKE OFF A FEW LEVELS OF SKIN IF YOU NEED A GRAFT. IT'S PACKED IN A LOT OF GREASE AND... OR MAYBE BLOOD. I HOPE IT'S GREASE. IT COULD BE BLOOD. I HAVE SOME GLOVES HERE, IF YOU'D LIKE. UM, YEAH. I THINK IT'S MOSTLY OIL. THEY TAKE THE DERMIS AND THE EPIDERMIS AND THEN THEY GET THE BLOOD VESSELS AND FAT LAYERS. AND THE BLADE WOULD FIT IN HERE. MAYBE AN OPERATOR WOULD HAND-OPERATE IT LIKE THIS? OH, THAT MUST HAVE HURT SO BAD. OOF. AND THEN YOU'D END UP WITH THIS NICE, LARGE SWATH OF SKIN THAT YOU COULD THEN ATTACH TO A WOUND ELSEWHERE ON THE BODY THAT CAN'T HEAL ON ITS OWN. THIS WOULD BE KIND OF A SCARY PROCEDURE. YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. IT'S VERY, VERY PAINFUL. I MEAN, YOUR SKIN... IT'S THE LARGEST ORGAN IN YOUR BODY. IT ALSO HAS PAIN RECEPTORS. EVEN TAKING OFF THE EPIDERMIS FROM THE DERMIS IS QUITE PAINFUL. IT'S LIKE A DELI SLICER. USING SKIN TO REPAIR SEVERE WOUNDS IS MOST EFFECTIVE WHEN A PATIENT'S OWN SKIN IS USED. IN SEVERE CASES, SKIN FROM ANOTHER PATIENT MAY BE USED, BUT THAT CAN BE REJECTED BY THE BODY'S IMMUNE SYSTEM IN ABOUT A WEEK. IN SOME SEVERE CASES, SKIN FROM ANIMALS LIKE PIGS CAN BE USED, BUT THAT CAN BE REJECTED IN TWO TO THREE DAYS. ARE YOU SELLING IT? YEAH, I'D BE INTERESTED IN SELLING IT. WHAT ARE YOU ASKING FOR IT? I DON'T KNOW. WHAT DO YOU THINK? HOW ABOUT, WHAT, $250? $250. UM... IT IS PRETTY CLEAN AND I WOULD LIKE TO PLAY WITH IT A LITTLE BIT. UM... YEAH, I GUESS WE CAN DO IT FOR $250. DEAL. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. UM... THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. FASCINATING. MY FRIEND NATTY WAS IN THE MARKET FOR A SHRUNKEN HEAD. UNFORTUNATELY, THE HUMAN ONES ARE OUT OF HIS BUDGET, SO I OFFERED TO MAKE HIM ONE MYSELF. SO, I'M LOOKING FOR AN APPROPRIATE ANIMAL VERSION AS A STAND-IN. HEY. HEY, RYAN. HOW ARE YOU? HOW ARE YOU, DIVYA? GOOD TO SEE YOU, DARLING. GOOD TO SEE YOU, TOO. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME OVER. OF COURSE. IT'S BEEN A LITTLE WHILE. IT'S ALWAYS A PLEASURE. YEAH. WOW. WOW. IS THIS THAT CAT THAT YOU WERE TELLING ME ABOUT? YEAH, THIS IS THAT CAT. THIS IS REALLY NICE. JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY, I NOTICE, LIKE, THIS CAT'S GOT SOME INTERESTING ACCESSORIES. UM, WHAT'S THAT ALL ABOUT? SO, ACTUALLY, I MADE IT FOR A SHOW THAT WAS ABOUT CATS AND MONEY. THIS CAT JUST SEEMED REALLY REGAL. YOU HAD TO MAKE HIM KIND OF, LIKE, GHETTO FABULOUS I THINK. I'M DIVYA. I DO TAXIDERMY. I GOT INTO TAXIDERMY BECAUSE, WHEN I WAS YOUNGER, I FOUND A LIZARD THAT DIED IN OUR MOSQUITO LAMP AND I KEPT IT IN A LITTLE AMARETTO COOKIE BOX. AND AFTER THAT, I JUST WANTED TO KNOW HOW I CAN KEEP THIS LITTLE LIZARD AND NOT HAVE IT STINK. SO, YEAH. SO, ANYWAYS, DIVYA, I HAD A CUSTOMER COME IN AND HE REALLY, REALLY WANTS A SHRUNKEN HEAD. COOL! NOW, THE PROBLEM THAT HE'S HAVING IS PRICE. THEY'RE VERY, VERY RARE AND, AS A RESULT, THEY'RE VERY EXPENSIVE. SO, I SUGGESTED WHY NOT DO SOMETHING IN, MAYBE, AN ANIMAL. SO, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING THAT WOULD WORK FOR THE PROCESS. YEAH, I THINK I'VE GOT SOMETHING. YOU DO? YEAH, I THINK SO. LET'S CHECK IT OUT. YEAH. SHALL WE? WE SHALL. IT DOES LOOK LIKE IT'S PRETTY WET. WHAT DO YOU HAVE IT FIXED IN? HE IS PRETTY WET. HE'S FIXED IN ALCOHOL. WOW. A SLOTH SKIN. IT LOOKS AMAZING. THIS IS A VERY LARGE SLOTH. IT'S FULL-GROWN. THIS IS KIND OF PERFECT, BECAUSE THE JIVARO INDIANS, THEY REALLY ONLY SHRUNK TWO THINGS... HUMAN HEADS AND SLOTHS. OH. THE JIVARO OF ECUADOR USED THESE NOTORIOUSLY SLOW-MOVING ANIMALS AS SUBSTITUTIONS WHEN THEY COULDN'T GET THEIR ENEMY'S ACTUAL HUMAN HEAD. SLOTHS ARE SO SLOW, IN FACT, THAT THEIR DAMP FUR GROWS A GREEN ALGAE THAT HELPS CAMOUFLAGE THEM IN THE TREES. HE'S GOT A PERFECT FACE FOR MY PURPOSES. I'M TOTALLY INTERESTED IN THIS. WHAT WOULD YOU WANT TO SELL IT FOR? UM... I FEEL LIKE $450 WOULD BE REASONABLE. $450? OKAY. YEAH. QUITE HONESTLY, I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE HECK ELSE I WOULD FIND A SLOTH SKIN FOR ANY CHEAPER, SO... I COULD DO $450. ALL RIGHT. COOL. AND ACTUALLY, DIVYA, I KNOW THAT YOU LIKE TO MESS AROUND WITH DEAD ANIMALS. YEAH. I MEAN, IF YOU'D LIKE TO HELP ME OUT, IT WOULD BE A COOL EXPERIENCE. I WOULD LOVE TO. WELL, COOL. LET'S WRAP THIS LITTLE FELLA UP. LET'S GET STARTED. WE'RE GONNA JUST START FILLING IT RIGHT UP. I BET YOU HAVEN'T DONE THIS BEFORE. I HAVEN'T. JUST MAKE SURE NOT TO GET IT ON THE ACTUAL FIRE. WHOA! OH! THIS IS "ODDITIES." - HELLO! - HELLO. WOW, LOOK AT YOU! WOW. YOU'VE GOT QUITE A SENSE OF STYLE. HELLO. SHE'S AN AFRICAN GREY? SHE HOUSE TRAINED, OR...? NO! UH, WELL, WE HAVE A FEW... PUT DOWN YOUR FRIENDS, IF YOU... I AM MS. COLOMBIA, THE QUEEN OF QUEENS. YOU LIKE THIS ONE? THAT'S A NICE PIECE. SURE. PLEASE DO. THAT'S ACTUALLY A PRETTY EXOTIC PIECE. THIS DATES TO ABOUT THE 1920s. CAREFUL. OH, LOOK AT THAT! YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF FUR THAT IS? IT'S MONKEY. WHERE'S HE GOING? I DON'T KNOW. WHAT'S HAPPENING? THE BIRD AND THE DOG ARE STILL HERE, SO THAT'S A GOOD SIGN. IT'S COLLATERAL. "BETTER COME BACK WITH OUR MONKEY OR WE GOT YOUR DOG AND BIRD." WELCOME BACK. OH, LOOK AT THAT. IT'S A COLOBUS GUEREZA MONKEY COAT. THIS MONKEY, WHOSE FUR FEELS EERILY LIKE HUMAN HAIR, IS NAMED COLOBUS, AFTER THE GREEK WORD FOR "MUTILATED," BECAUSE THIS MONKEY DOESN'T HAVE THUMBS LIKE OTHER MONKEYS. SURE! SURE. THE COLOBUS'S LACK OF A THUMB MAY BE AN EVOLUTIONARY ADAPTATION THAT HELPS THEM MOVE MORE QUICKLY THROUGH THEIR FOREST HABITAT. WE HAVE THIS HAT, AND THIS ACTUALLY CAME FROM A KNIGHT TEMPLAR. VERY BEAUTIFUL. THAT'S AN OLD ONE. PROBABLY ABOUT 18... I LIKE THAT. WOW, WHAT DO YOU THINK? $65? MM... THANK YOU SO MUCH. OH, WELL, THANK YOU! IT WAS LOVELY. AND THANK YOU FOR THE FASHION SHOW. YEAH! I'M INSPIRED. OH, AND DON'T FORGET YOUR HAIR. NO, MY... YOU'RE WELCOME. GOODBYE, MS. COLOMBIA! THAT'S A LOOK. MM-HMM. I'VE BEEN COMMISSIONED TO TRY TO CREATE A SHRUNKEN HEAD FOR A CUSTOMER OF OURS. SINCE SHRINKING A HUMAN HEAD IS OUT OF THE QUESTION, I'M USING A SLOTH, WHICH WERE ACTUALLY USED BY THE JIVARO TRIBE. THEY WERE MASTER HEAD-SHRINKERS. THEY WOULD USE THESE AS SUBSTITUTES WHEN THEY COULDN'T GET THEIR ENEMIES' ACTUAL HUMAN HEADS. MY FRIEND DIVYA SOLD ME THE SLOTH AND SHE'S GONNA HELP ME IN THE BACKYARD SHRINKING PROCESS. HEY, RYAN. HOW ARE YOU? HEY, WHAT'S UP, DIVYA? I'M JUST LAYING THE SLOTH OUT. I BET YOU HAVEN'T DONE THIS BEFORE. I HAVEN'T. SO, I GOT THE GRILL STARTED UP, 'CAUSE WHAT BASICALLY IS GONNA HAPPEN IS, AFTER WE GET THE HEAD CUT OFF OF THIS AND SEWN UP, YOU WANT TO FILL IT WITH STONES, AND THAT'S WHAT'S ACTUALLY GONNA CURE THE FLESH AND, EVENTUALLY, SHRINK THE HEAD. IT'S LIKE PUTTING WET LEATHER IN A DRYER, BASICALLY. ALL RIGHT. EXCELLENT. SO, IF YOU WANT TO START SEWING THERE, I'LL JUST START GOING FROM THIS END. IF THE LADIES AT THE KNITTING STORE THAT SOLD ME THESE SUPPLIES ONLY KNEW. THEY PROBABLY THOUGHT I WAS KNITTING A SWEATER FOR MY MOM. I LOVE THE, LIKE, LITTLE... DISCS OF MEAT THAT POP OUT. TURNING ANIMAL SKINS INTO LEATHER IS A COMPLEX AND SORT OF MYSTERIOUS PROCESS. FIRST, THE SKIN IS CURED OR DRIED OUT, AND THEN A CHEMICAL AGENT IS USED IN THE TANNING PROCESS. NOWADAYS, WE USE THINGS LIKE CHROMIUM, BUT HISTORICALLY, THINGS LIKE FISH OIL, ANIMAL BRAINS, AND EVEN HUMAN URINE WERE USED. IT LOOKS GREAT. OKAY. SO, WE'RE GETTING THERE. LET'S THROW THESE ON AND GET STARTED. BASICALLY, WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO, FLIP HIM UPSIDE DOWN AND WE'RE GONNA JUST START FILLING IT RIGHT UP. ALL RIGHT. SHOULD I HOLD IT OPEN? YEAH. JUST TRYING TO GET THE STONES INTO THE SMALL AREAS. WE'RE CONSTANTLY REFILLING AND SHAPING IT. BUT, WE ALSO WANT TO KIND OF MANIPULATE THE SKIN TO MAKE SURE WE KEEP THE SHAPE. ALL RIGHT. JUST MAKE SURE NOT TO GET IT ON THE ACTUAL FIRE. WHOA! OH! THIS IS "ODDITIES." YOU WANT TO FILL THE SLOTH WITH STONES AND THAT'S WHAT'S ACTUALLY GONNA CURE THE FLESH AND, EVENTUALLY, SHRINK THE HEAD. WE'RE GONNA JUST START FILLING IT RIGHT UP. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. JUST MAKE SURE NOT TO GET IT ON THE ACTUAL FIRE. WHOA! OH! ALMOST GOT IT IN THE FACE. MAKE SURE THAT SNOUT IS FILLED. THE SHRINKING PROCESS IS PRETTY MAGICAL. I MEAN, FIRST YOU HEAR THE SIZZLE OF THE STONES HITTING THE SKIN AND CURING IT. YOU'RE BASICALLY, LIKE, CREATING THIS LITTLE SACK OF A HEAD. HE'S ADORABLE! AS A COUPLE PASSES OF STONES GO BY, IT'S AMAZING HOW ITS FACE IS JUST SHAPING UP. I LOVE THAT IT LOOKS LIKE A HEAD WITH A TAIL. THAT'S SO AWESOME. I THINK WE'RE ACTUALLY IN PRETTY GOOD SHAPE. AS YOU CAN SEE, WE'VE GOTTEN DOWN, I DON'T KNOW, 20%? YEAH. THAT'S TOTALLY LIKE 20%, 25%. I TRULY APPRECIATE YOU HELPING ME. OH, THANK YOU SO MUCH. IT WAS A PLEASURE DOING THIS WITH YOU. I'LL TALK TO YOU SOON, DIVYA. I'LL TALK TO YOU SOON. HEY. WHAT'S UP, MAN? HEY, MAN. HOW'S IT GOING? GOOD TO SEE YOU. GOOD TO SEE YOU, TOO. MY BUDDY NATTY COMMISSIONED ME TO MAKE A SHRUNKEN HEAD. SO, I TRIED SOMETHING I'VE NEVER DONE BEFORE... I ACTUALLY MADE MY OWN SHRUNKEN HEAD FROM A SLOTH. IT WAS A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE. I JUST HOPE THAT NATTY LIKES IT AS MUCH AS I DO. WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE IT? YEAH! I'M DYING TO SEE IT. HOLD ON ONE SECOND, I HAVE IT IN THE BACK. EXCELLENT. ALL RIGHT, MAN. SHRUNKEN SLOTH'S HEAD. OH, MY GOD. THAT'S INCREDIBLE. I'M GONNA ACTUALLY PUT THIS HERE SO I CAN SHOW YOU A COUPLE LITTLE DETAILS. AFTER I GOT THE SLOTH SKIN, YOU SLOWLY START TO CURE THE SKIN WITH HOT STONE. WHEN LEATHER GETS WET AND IT DRIES, IT SHRINKS. AND THAT'S THE SAME EXACT PROCESS AS THIS. SO, WHAT IT DOES IS BASICALLY JUST SHRINKS INTO ITSELF. AND THEN, FINALLY, YOU END UP WITH A PIECE THAT IS HALF THE SIZE OF WHERE YOU STARTED. IT'S AMAZING. DID YOU DO THIS ALL AT HOME? I DID IT ALL AT HOME. OKAY. YEAH, I DID IT ALL IN MY BACK YARD WITH THE HELP OF MY FRIEND. RIGHT. WELL, THIS IS ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE. WHAT ARE THE STRINGS IN THE FRONT FOR? I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE REALLY COOL... 'CAUSE WHEN YOU SEE A HUMAN SHRUNKEN HEAD, THEY ALMOST ALWAYS HAVE THESE LONG LIP STRINGS. YEAH, I LIKE THAT. I TRIED TO MAKE THIS PIECE LOOK AS LEGITIMATE AS POSSIBLE. YEAH, IT LOOKS AMAZING. THE REASON WHY THIS CORD IS ON HERE... YOU COULD ACTUALLY WEAR IT AROUND YOUR NECK. SO, AT THE NEXT PARTY YOU GO TO, NATTY... SOUNDS GOOD. ...YEAH, YOU CAN WEAR THIS WITH YOUR FINE SUIT. YEAH. "OH, THAT? OH, THAT'S NOTHING. JUST MY SHRUNKEN SLOTH'S HEAD." NO BIG DEAL. SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK, MAN? I'M COMPLETELY BLOWN AWAY. THIS IS SO COOL. THANK YOU. I HAVE TO SAY, IT WAS A FIRST, SO THIS WAS CERTAINLY A LEARNING PROCESS FOR ME. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT. I HAD NO IDEA WHAT IT WAS GONNA LOOK LIKE, AND THIS IS ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC. THANK YOU. IT'S WONDERFUL. SO, HOW MUCH WILL THIS BE? WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT $2,200? YEAH. THAT SOUNDS GOOD. WE GOT A DEAL, BUDDY. EXCELLENT, MAN. LET'S GO WRAP THIS UP. YOU KNOW, SOME PEOPLE LIKE HAMBURGERS, SOME PEOPLE LIKE HOT DOGS, BUT TO ME, NOTHING SAYS "AMERICAN HOMESTYLE BARBECUE" LIKE A SLOTH HEAD. MEDIUM RARE. SHRUNKEN SLOTH HEAD. I LOVE IT.
