 I am a mutant. And so were you. REED: Dad? We need to talk to you about your work. At Trask. They're experimenting on mutants. My own best friend was turned. He's working for Sentinel Services. OTTO: A research project to eliminate the X-Gene. That was what brought me to Trask. REED: When I was sick? Dad, I nearly died. ESME: I'm a telepath

 and I've been getting some very weird thoughts from one of the others. Hey. CAITLIN: You don't have to talk. Just think. Who did this to you? Where are they? I can see it. It's a building. Some kind of lab. North of here. OTTO: My father and his sister Andrea were known as Fenris. The Wolf. They had the same abilities as your children. Have they held hands? Shoot him!

 SS AGENT: Don't worry, Dr. Campbell, we're going to get you to a hospital. Gus. I'm gonna make them pay for what they did to you. - LAUREN: What happened with your dad? - REED: He died today. Oh, babe. [BIRDS SINGING, CHILDREN CHATTERING] Andy! CAITLIN: Nice. I didn't know you could do that. I have all kinds of secret talents. [CAITLIN LAUGHS] REED: Hey... This is good, right? Well, don't get cocky, but yeah. It's really good. It's been too long since we've done this. - I'm sorry work's been so crazy. - Don't. We understand. What you do, it's important. It's just, I've missed you. The kids, too. Well, I'm here now. - [LAUGHS SOFTLY] - They doing all right? CAITLIN: Yeah. I mean, Lauren's been a little distant lately, but I think it's just normal teenager stuff. It's nice to see them not bickering for once. Wanna try that? - No, I'm not gonna do that. - What do you mean? I don't skateboard. Yeah, you can. Here. Back foot on the tail, front foot halfway up the deck. It's fine, it's easy. Pop and flick... like a karate kick, okay? - Halfway up... - I'm gonna fall, no. No, you... Trust me. I'm... I'll be here. I can catch you. - Promise? - Yeah. Help me up. Okay. - Ready? - Yeah. LAUREN: Okay. [LAUREN GASPS] Hey! You guys all right over there? Yeah. Messing around. ♪ ♪ [BIRDS SINGING FAINTLY] ♪ ♪ ELLEN: Reed, don't. Your father's working. ELLEN: But you're leaving me to do this all on my own, Otto. He needs you. He's your son. What do you mean, you can't come to see him? [EXHALES] Hey, you. [CAITLIN EXHALES] I woke up and you were gone. I'm sorry. Couldn't sleep. Thinking about your dad? I hadn't spoken to the man in 20 years. I... didn't think losing him would make me... [SIGHS] I get it. My mom and I couldn't be in the same room without her bringing up every screwup of my teenage years to remind me how perfect Jenny and Danny were. [REED SIGHS] When she got sick, we finally started to get past all that crap, but... it was too late. I almost think it's worse when you're not close, because... you realize how much time you missed. Yeah. Reed, I... I hate to bring this up, but... I have to ask. If Otto was a mutant... and your grandfather and his twin were, too... I-It's just, I... I thought mutations were random. Mostly, they are. But they can be passed down, too. Then why did it skip you? [EXHALES] Did it skip you? My dad's work at Trask Industries... He spent his life trying to find a way to suppress the X-Gene... in me. [EXHALES] And he succeeded. But it came back. In our kids. I... Did you know? - Of course not. What? - I-I... Did you think I'd keep something like that from you? I'm sorry, I-I'm just trying to wrap my head around how this never came up after all these years. Your mom, she... For two years, we thought I had leukemia, Cait. He kept it as a secret from everybody. And it destroyed my family. Well, we're not going to let it destroy ours. [BIRDS SINGING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] ESME: We need to go after the Trask lab now. We have to rescue those people... Have to? You're pretty new here to be telling people what they have to do. You don't get it! My family is in there. - They're running out of time. - Okay, well, slow down. THUNDERBIRD: You got all that information from the woman they sent after us? Yes. I mean, her mind was hard to read. Confused. But I got enough. The mutants in that lab, they were desperate. I-I could hear the screams. I could see the bodies. I could feel the agony when they turned that woman into that thing. And it's all happening in that building. We know where this place is? I'm assembling a site map now. So why are we standing here? Did you get anything on their security? No. It... Her mind was too cloudy, but what does it matter? We are the last hope those prisoners have. You saw what they did to your friend. We sit on our hands, and that happens to more people. No one is sitting on their hands. Now, we will make a move on that lab, but if we go in blind... we die. Johnny? Are you all right? [THUNDERBIRD SIGHS] How can I be "all right"? Maybe Esme has a point. But she's just a scared kid, who has no idea what she's talking about. She was right about one thing. Pulse. I left him behind and they took him to that lab. That's not on you, Johnny. And continuing to blame yourself is not doing anybody any good. Besides, d... don't you think it's strange that she knew about Pulse? - I mean, she just got here. - She's a telepath, Sonya. Maybe she picked it up off of me. It doesn't change the fact that I gave up on my friend and they turned him into a monster. I'll be damned if I'm gonna let that happen to anybody else. Hey. Lauren. You awake? [SIGHS] Yeah. I can't stop thinking about what Dad said. About Grandpa Otto being... like us. Not just him. Here, check this out. I found this in the library. You know where the library is here? Who are you and what have you done with Andy? Ha ha ha. Look, this section's on the 1950s. Andrea and Andreas von Strucker. They called themselves "Fenris"? Yeah, I think it means "wolf" in some language. LAUREN: Oh, my God. - They did that? - Yeah. They combined powers by holding hands. They wiped out an entire building full of people in seconds. This is crazy. This is our family history. Look, it says here they're "rumored to be" "part of a shadowy international organization" "called the Hellfire Club." Does it say what happened to them? I think they disappeared fleeing from the X-Men. They were some of the most powerful mutants ever. Yeah. It also says they were monsters. - Well, I'm just saying... - I don't care. Go to bed. [BABY CRYING IN DISTANCE] Hello? [CRYING STOPS] [DISTORTED BABY CRYING] - [CRYING FADES] - [GROANS] Marcos. Marcos! Marcos, what's happening? [ECHOING]: Marcos! [GRUNTING] [BABY CRYING IN DISTANCE] Oh, no. - [CRYING CONTINUES] - No, no, no... No, no, no, no! [SOBS] [SCREAMS] [GRUNTS] [GRUNTING] [SCREAMS] [SCREAMING] Hey, hey, hey, it was just a dream. The baby... the baby's at Trask. No. Hey, the baby's here. - Hey, the baby's fine. - [PANTING] POLARIS: Marcos, in my dream, Trask had the baby. We have to get into that lab. - We have... we have to help those people. - Yeah. ECLIPSE: We will. Hey. We will. I promise. I promise. [ECLIPSE PANTING] - [DISTANT SIREN WAILING] - [OVER P.A.]: Dr. Barnes... [PAINED GROANING] How's he doing? Docs said Campbell was burned pretty bad, but he'll live. Said he didn't want surgery. I guess his mutant has skills. [PAINED GROANING] The Mutant Underground's gonna be looking to launch another attack... we got to put a team together. Come on, be tough to sell an operation like that without specific intel. Washington was pissed about losing those two agents. Washington's pissed? I'm the one that had to tell the families. Look, we got all the intel we need. The Underground knows about the Hound program now. They're gonna have to hit Campbell's lab. The place is top secret... how will they even find it? What are you talking about? They're mutants. They can shoot lasers out of their hands. I'm pretty sure they can find a building. I know I'm right about this. We can bury the paperwork. Just... get some techs on it, all right? Yeah. I'll see what I can do. [PAINED GROANING] I've been looking into the Trask lab. This place is out in the middle of nowhere. There is no information on it. But there is this. THUNDERBIRD: A bar? What good does that do us? I cross-referenced credit card activity with places near the lab, and this place is popular with Trask employees. I could go in. Pull some information out of a guard or an operations person. That's a good idea. I'll go for protection. - No. I will. - Are you sure, babe? I mean, you haven't really been sleeping well. I'm okay. Marcos, if you want to get information from a guy at a bar, you don't send a girl and another guy. We'll be fine. Hey. Hope you're hungry. I have a nondairy cheese and chive omelet with your name on it. [REED CHUCKLES] How are you handling all of this? [EXHALES] I know it's not fair, but I... I keep thinking how different everything would have been. I-if Lauren would have just told us she was a mutant. - Come on, we can't go down that road. - Or if your father would have just told everyone the truth. Our whole lives would be different. Your job. H-How we raised our kids. - I mean, Andy may have never... - We did the best that we could. [SHUDDERING EXHALE] Hmm. What about you? If... if you'd known then what you know now... would you have done anything differently? With us? No. Cait... [SIGHS] There is one more thing I haven't told you. My dad told me that his father and aunt... were terrorists. - What? - They had the same powers as Andy and Lauren. And when they combined them together, they were massively destructive. I... And you... you think Andy and Lauren can do the same thing? - I don't know. - Well, - we have to tell them. - Do we? Isn't that like - handing them a loaded gun? - Your father, he didn't tell you you were a mutant... you think he did the right thing? [SIGHS] No more secrets, Reed. POLARIS: So, you're really in charge? Of the entire security system? I mean, not like the boss boss, but of my shift? Yeah. Basically, I... I run it. - Hmm. - Wow, that sounds intense. DREAMER: Mm-hmm. You don't know the half of it. The place is like a fortress. You know, automatic guns, detectors... ♪ ♪ I shouldn't be telling you any of this. Must be so scary to work with mutants. Do you ever worry they'll attack you? Oh, they have a whole program in place to make them behave. Remember when they were calling themselves. "Homo superior"? Well, they're not so superior when you... crack 'em in the head with a nightstick. I mean, one good shot to the temple... they drop... A little like that? Lorna, what the hell? What? I'm just teaching him - to respect the genetically different. - [GROANS] Quit crying. Nobody saw. Just do your thing. Give him anything to remember us by? Mm. Just a lonely night... till he cracked his head on a urinal. Best girls' night ever. ♪ ♪ So, you guys are for real right now? Like, seriously serious? Yes, that's-that's why we thought we should... deal with this as a family. I think we learned the hard way that discovering mutant abilities by accident isn't ideal. REED: Look, it might be nothing. My dad could possibly be wrong. Just because the von Strucker twins could do it - doesn't necessarily mean... - What if he's right? You want us to destroy something? - Definitely not. No. - No. No. Th-That's... that's why we wanted to test it in the vault... just to... [SIGHS] ...to see if there's anything there. Okay. [ANDY EXHALES] [LAUREN EXHALES] ♪ ♪ So... this is weird. [SIGHS] But is... is there... anything? Yeah. Andy's hand is sweaty. CAITLIN: O-Okay. Well, then maybe there's... there's nothing to worry about. Maybe it's nothing. No. Wait. Just give it a chance, okay? Maybe we gotta, like, squeeze harder or something, actually want something to happen. Come on. Please? We got to try. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Hey. Hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey! CAITLIN: What happened? LAUREN: I don't know. It was like... - I could feel... - Everything around me. All we had to do is push. I-I don't understand. Did you use the power? Dad... if we tried... Did you feel that? Everything coming apart? - Kids, what happened? - LAUREN: We were about to bring down the entire building. We would have killed everyone here. ♪ ♪ Sonya and I have been going through the memories she got from that guard and it does not look good. What are we up against? Well, the lab is hardened against mutant attack. They have motion and infrared sensors connected to heavy-caliber guns that are mounted all over their building. - Guns? I can handle guns. - ECLIPSE: I know, but it is way too dangerous when there's this many, at this range. Clarice, can you get us past their defenses? No. It's too far. I don't know the first thing about the inside of that place. I could blink us into the middle of a concrete wall. Well, there has to be something. I did find one vulnerability. There is a power substation a few miles away. If we took it out, we could get into the lab before their systems came back on line. - So what are we waiting for? - We don't have enough heavy hitters to attack both places at once. And we're checking with - the other stations now. - Well, how long is that gonna take, - because my family... - Listen, I understand... Believe me. This means as much to me as it does to you. But we are gonna get one shot at this. We can't miss. So, what happened in the vault? CAITLIN: What did you feel, exactly? ANDY: Everything around us kind of... just disappeared. And it's like, there wasn't two of us anymore. There was just one. It's like... we were seeing out of the same eyes. You said you could have destroyed a building. - How did you know that? - I could feel it. Andy pushes things apart, right? I do the opposite, I can pull them together. Combined, it was like, we could do whatever we wanted. I mean, we were looking at the wall in front of us, and-and we could have just... vaporized it. - Maybe if we practice, we... - Practice? What? We can do it, we might as well get better at it. REED: Eh, you've been given a gift, and a power like that could hurt people, you can't just go around using it... So we should just stuff it down and bury it like your dad did? How'd that work out? - That's way out of bounds, Andy. - ANDY: Mom. It's who we are, okay? It's who I am. Andy, sometimes you can't control your own powers. ANDY: I see. So I'm just some kind of monster. That's not what he meant. At least you guys have one kid you can actually trust. Mom... Let me talk to him. LAUREN: Andy... - Andy! - What? You know Mom and Dad are just trying to protect us, right? Yeah, yeah, I totally get it. I'm a freak because I don't hate my powers. You think I hated that? I've never felt so powerful. It scared me... because it felt good. Do you remember that time that it happened before? At the park. - You felt that? - Yeah. That was before I even knew I was a mutant. I mean, I... That's when I started messing up at school. It's 'cause I couldn't get it out of my mind. Me, too. All I want to do right now is try that again. Does that mean... does that mean we're gonna be like them? The von Struckers? Honestly... I don't know. So this is the substation? Uh, yeah. Sage was able to get it using the guard's system access. Look, are you sure we can't take this down ourselves? I'm good with electronics. Sage said we get three minutes tops before the generators kick back on. - We'd never get back to the lab in time. - [SIGHS] Listen, we need to talk about the other night. It was a nightmare. It's nothing. Nothing? It's not nothing. I think all the furniture in our room would disagree. - Look, if you're worried about the baby... - If? Of course I'm worried about the baby. Why? I'm not sure that this place is gonna make it. No matter what, I will protect you, and that kid. That's a promise. I don't know if that's a promise you can keep. [QUIETLY]: What? Hey. Am I interrupting? Yes. No, it's all right. - What is it? - I have an idea. For the power station, how to knock it out. Yeah? What's that? We use the Strucker kids. [HORN HONKS IN DISTANCE] No, it's-it's probably gonna be another late night... PAULA [OVER PHONE]: What else is new? JACE: I know, I know. Look, I'm sorry. It's just, we're on to something, here. We're getting really close. I-I just don't like that you're going back to work - so soon after... - Babe. This is exactly why I have to be here. This isn't just about me. I want justice, for Grace, for all of us. Just... come home safe. I will. When the job is done. When the job's done. - I love you. - I love you, too. What do we got, Ed? I called in some favors. [DOOR CLOSES] I was able to pull together a team to look into the lab. All right. Good job. Just know: We're out on the skinny branches here. An unauthorized investigation into a covert facility? If this fails, we're talking to the FBI in handcuffs. Then we best not fail. ECLIPSE: We need you to do the same thing to the substation transformers that you did to the prison convoy bus. We know it's a lot to ask, but... now we just don't see another way. Look, we want to help, but why does it need to be Lauren and Andy? Well, because we need everyone else with combat powers to assault the lab. Now, we think that we can take down that power substation without putting them at any risk. So exploding high voltage transformers is the safe job? In this case, yes. ECLIPSE: Sage hacked the security cameras and the station only has a handful of guards. Clarice will get everyone in. Sonya will guide them. THUNDERBIRD: We've been through every option. This is the only one that works. I'm down. Let's do it. Okay. But Caitlin and I need to be the ones monitoring the security. If our kids are there, we are, too. Look, Sage will set you up, show you what to do. THUNDERBIRD: All right, everybody get ready. We move out in an hour. ♪ ♪ [CAR DOORS CLOSING] All right, this is it. Gate's up there. We'll go check it out, see what we're dealing with. Sounds good. We'll get the party favors. - ESME: [GASPS] Oh. - That's a detonator. Drop it too hard, this ends quick. - Sorry. - You seem a bit jumpy. Have you ever done anything like this before? Not exactly. Okay, before we go in there, you got to understand something. When the shooting starts, everything changes. If you're not ready, then I... I... I am ready. I just, I slipped. Okay? Look, if you're here because you think this is gonna be some adventure, you're making a mistake. [ECLIPSE SHOUTS] POLARIS: Marcos! [SHOUTING] [GROWLS, SCREAMS] Hey. Have you ever been so angry about someone you love getting hurt that you would do anything to stop the pain? That's why I'm here. For the people I love in that building. I can't leave them. They're a part of me. ECLIPSE: That is a long stroll from the fence to the building. Well, we knew it wouldn't be easy. Yeah. Says the bulletproof guy. This would have been so much easier if we had Pulse with us. - Yeah. - He could've taken out - every automated gun in that place. - [GRUNTS] Course, we'd be hearing tales of his awesomeness for months. [LAUGHS] Yeah. I miss him. Yeah, me, too. But John, you weren't the only person that left him there that night. That's on all of us, not just you. And today, we get to make it up to him. [ZIPS BAG] [BEEPS] We're in place. REED: Copy that. We're en route. We're almost at the power substation. Okay, be safe out there. What we're doing here, it's a parent's worst nightmare. - We can handle... - Andy, we know. We know you can. We're doing this because we trust you. Hey, Struckers, heads up. We're here. [BRAKES SQUEAK] [PHONE BEEPS, DIALS] Yeah. - We're ready. - Okay. Bypassing the firewall. And you should have picture in three, two, one. REED: Okay. It's working. SAGE: I looped the camera feeds so security can't see our team. But they'll notice eventually, so be quick. BLINK: Okay, guys. I'm gonna need some room here, kid. Uh, yeah. - ANDY: Bye, Mom. - Okay. We got this. BLINK: Um, guys? It's a little trickier than holding an elevator. Can we hurry this up please? WEEKS: Turner. We've checked into everything. No irregularities at the lab, no alarms, no nothing. What about lab employees? Anything unusual going on there? All the background checks came back clean. We've got a guy out of town for a funeral, one sick leave... Who's the sick leave? Security guard. Called last night. Access the Trask employee network. Pull up his record. I think it's a dead end. Guy passed out in a bar, bumped his head. Probably sleeping off his hangover. JACE: Right there. He accessed information on the power station. WEEKS: Power station? That's miles away. JACE: Yeah, but it powers the lab. They hit that, they could get in. - I'll call the lab. - No. No. The mutants could be monitoring communication there... we're not calling anybody. We need a tactical team. Remote units, everything. We're not gonna be able to do that under the radar. I don't care, this is it, man. I can feel it, okay? Let's go. Hey. Can you hear me okay? We made it inside. We can hear you just fine. All right, we're going in. Hold on. There are some workers in the hallway in front of you. [MUFFLED CHATTER] Okay... Okay, you're clear. Sure you know where you're going? Um, pretty sure. The guard I borrowed the memory from had only been here a few times, so it's a little hazy. The transformer we need to take out is in the middle of the building. So why didn't you just portal us there? CAITLIN: Hold up, there's a conference room on your right. Can you make a portal through a hundred walls into a room you've never seen before and land safely next to a high-voltage transformer? - CAITLIN: Okay, you're clear. - No. Yeah. Neither can I. [MONITOR BEEPING] Incoming, door to your left. What are you doing here? Oh, did they not call? From the front desk? No, I didn't get a call. Hang on just a sec. Come on. You remember me. Or maybe you don't remember. Reed... REED: Nice job, Sonya. THUNDERBIRD: All right, remember, once the Struckers take down the transformer at the power station, we only have three minutes to get the charges up by the automated guns - and get inside of Trask. - Don't forget about the part where if we're off by a few seconds, we all get slaughtered. - Marcos, not helpful. - I'm sorry, it's just, look, once we get in there, we don't know what we're doing or where we're going. Well, that's why she's here. First, we free the prisoners. Then we destroy the mainframes and the research. Yeah, right. So these prisoners... how do you know they're gonna help us? Believe me, they'll help. Okay, uh, the next few hallways seem clear. DREAMER: Got it. Thanks. [CAITLIN SIGHS] They're gonna be all right. Yeah. When you used to go on busts, how'd... how did you deal with it... the nerves? The first few times, I... I threw up. Really? You never told me that. Well, we were still dating. I was trying to impress you. I still am. I found that if I focused just on my plan, it got better. Now, our plan is to watch over the kids. To keep them safe. We'll get through this. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] WEEKS: Sir, I still don't buy it. Do you really think they'd come here? I thought they were going after Campbell's lab. They will. They will. It's not a coincidence that the guard that called in sick accessed specs of this power substation. I'm telling you, it's the mutants trying to disable the lab security before they go in. Zone 1 is clear. You're making a lot of leaps, here. I mean, if the remote units don't find anything, we're done... you know that, right? SS TECH 2: Pushing past Zone 2. All clear. SS TECH: Zone 3, clear. Advancing to 4. Come on... Sir. Remote unit just targeted. We've got mutants. Yes, we got 'em. We got 'em, we're hot. Let's go! Oh, my God. Wait. - Oh, my God. - What is it? What did you see? Hold on. I... Oh... Look! There. Sonya, get out of there. Get out of there now! - CAITLIN: Get out of there! - Wait, I don't understand. - What's going on? - Reed. Look! There is a Sentinel robot and arms teams in the building! Get out of there now! We got to go. Now. - What the hell is going on? - They know we're here. - They're coming for us. - JACE: All units move in. All units move in. Sir, the Sentinels... they were destroyed last time. Not this time. Techs have been working with them. They've been learning... This time, they're ours. - What about the power transformer? - There's no time! Clarice, you gotta get us out. I don't even know where we are in this building. I don't know which direction. The-the, there's too many hallways, I don't know. Hurry, please! I-I-I know, I'm trying. Okay. Okay, I got it! Guys! Guys! Hey, guys, guys! - Andy! - Uh, yeah, m-move, move. Move! [GROANING, STRAINING] Run! DREAMER: Clarice! No! Go! Go! Reed. Sonya? Sonya! Do you copy? [SHRILL ELECTRIC FEEDBACK] We have to go, Reed. We have to help them! We can't, we can't, we can't get in the building, we'll get caught. We can't help them if we get captured, too. [ALARM BLARING] ECLIPSE: Hijo de perra... What happened? Did somebody see us? MAN [ECHOING]: We're on full lockdown! MAN 2: Mutants tried to hit the power station. MAN 3: Sentinel Services caught 'em, said we might be next... No, they're not coming for us. We got to go. Operation's blown. Come on! What? What? No. No, we-we can't go, - we have to get in there! - That's it. - They have our team at the substation. - No, I am not leaving. - We have to get in there! - We're going! - Come on, it's over. - No! No, please, my family. - Don't make me leave them behind! - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - Come on. - No! No...! WOMAN [OVER P.A.]: Attention, all employees. This is not a drill. The facility is under attack. Observe full lockdown procedures. Repeat: Full lockdown procedures are in effect. ANDY: What are we gonna do? Sage gave me the codes. [AGENTS SHOUTING] - ANDY: Come on! - LAUREN: They're coming! DREAMER: Come on, hurry! - Freeze! - ANDY: Behind you! - Run. - LAUREN: Wait... - Run! - ANDY AND LAUREN: No, no, no! AGENT: Get down on the ground, now! [ALARM BLARING] [INDISTINCT GUARD CHATTER] We can get out. We can get out if we did what we did before. Like Fenris. - What are you doing? - We can't... - We have to! - No. We're in the basement of the building. If we do it, everyone's gonna die. - Stay where you are! - [WEAPONS COCKING] - JACE: Andy... Lauren. - [LAUREN GASPS] JACE: Don't move. - REED: No. - CAITLIN: Oh, my God. No! No, Cait, what are you doing? - Those are our children, Reed! - We can't. We can't. There's nothing we can do. It's over. Get on your knees. - Reed, we can't just leave them. - Cait, Cait... [CAITLIN SOBBING] Get on your knees, now. [MOUTHING] [COLLAR POWERS UP] Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
