 Pulse, it's me. [GROANS] - [GRUNTING] - ECLIPSE: There are rumors of mutants hunting other mutants for Sentinel Services. Reed Strucker worked with a judge at the courthouse. If we break in, we might be able to figure out what - the hell's going on. - It looks like it's mostly information on mutants who were sent to Trask Industries. Whatever this is, they're behind it. My father worked there for 35 years. CARMEN: I call, you come,

 and you do exactly what I ask you to do. ECLIPSE: I did this for you and for our baby. Lorna. Your friend Dreamer stuck a memory in my head. I've got my own issues to sort out. You're tough to track, you know that? BLINK: Remember when I got sick? I kept trying to portal to that road? Let me help you find it. BLINK: That's the farmhouse. Carl? Denise? Clarice, I'm sorry.

 JACE: I don't just want them! Shut down every safe house, every sympathizer, anyone who's ever helped 'em. I want 'em all! I hear you're working with a Dr. Campbell? He runs a program that officially doesn't exist. I'm requesting a court order if you don't... [COUGHS] CAMPBELL: We've started with the assets who can target the Underground immediately. Don't think of 'em as spies. More like weapons. We may finally be in a position to win this war. [MAN SINGING OPERATICALLY] ♪ ♪ [PHONE RINGING] - [TIRES SCREECHING IN DISTANCE] - Hello? WOMAN: What's wrong? What happened? They found us, sister. - [CRASHING] - MAN: Interpol! Quick! You're under arrest. Pity. I liked this place. [AGENTS SCREAMING] ♪ ♪ Hey, guys. So, we need to talk, and I know it's late, but I just learned something and it's important that you hear about it from me. What's going on? Yeah, you're kind of freaking me out. You know we've been looking into the Sentinel Services program that's turning mutants into weapons against other... well, against all of us here. Yeah, you were searching those computer drives. You found something? I'm afraid so. Sentinel Services have been working with a defense contractor called Trask Industries. CAITLIN: Wait. The same Trask Industries where your father worked? REED: Yeah. ANDY: You said Grandpa disappeared years ago. That he ran out on you and Grandma. That's not entirely true. He lives up in Chattanooga. That's only two hours away. We've never even met him. Okay, that was intentional. He wasn't good to your father, growing up. He's a difficult man. He was always working, he was never home. We weren't close. I got sick when I was a kid. I almost died, and... he didn't even bother to come to the hospital. Harsh. REED: I haven't spoken to him since before you guys were born. Well, I think you're going to need to speak to him now. [BLADE WHISKS THROUGH AIR, POWERS WHIRR] ECLIPSE: I hate it when you do that. You coming to bed? I thought I'd sleep here. Lorna, we can't go on like this. Ask your ex-girlfriend from the cartel. - Maybe she can help. - Babe. I went to Carmen to save you. Part of the deal was working for her. What was I supposed to do? You could've started by not enjoying it so much. I saw you with her, Marcos. I saw the look on your face as you torched that truck. I saw her kiss you when you were done. [SCOFFS] We are already in a war. You want to start another one with the cartel? With a baby on the way? How are we supposed to raise a baby? Our world is falling apart. We do it together. That's it. Whatever happens... we can protect it. We can barely protect ourselves. Lorna... [BIRDS SINGING] We're going to need to talk to the folks in Gainesville, make sure they're ready for more refugees. I'm on it. Hey, John, can I have a word? We need to go see my father in Chattanooga. I know it's a risk, but he is our only connection to Trask. You think he'll know something? Maybe, maybe not. We don't have much choice. [SIGHS] The station in Perry just fell. We're going to pick up survivors now. You prep a car, some supplies. We'll leave as soon as I get back. Clarice is getting the cars ready. Clarice? Lorna's not coming, man. Is something wrong? Everything's fine. Marcos, a problem between you two affects everyone. You're both leaders at this station... She's just not coming, okay? All right. Hey. I know things have been awkward since you got back. I hope there's no hard feelings between us. Well, I'm going to have to disappoint you. I'm only here for one reason: My foster parents were slaughtered by the Sentinel Services and I'm gonna fight back. This is a war. And we're on the same side. It's the only relationship we need. [ENGINE STARTS] MAN: Grateful you came so quick. Sentinel Services is even coming after us now. So much for sanctuary. How many refugees are there? A dozen fled here when the station in Perry got hit. Plus a few strays. Let's load them up. I just have to hide them in here during services. I got you, Padre. PASTOR: It's all right. These are friends. They'll get you to safety. - [MURMURING] - Wow. Toss your stuff in the back, grab a seat, quick as you can. We'll brief you on everything once we get where we're going. ECLIPSE: You want to keep it? Here you go. BLINK: Hey. You okay? It's all right. Come on. I got you. WOMAN: Hey. I need to talk to you. - What is it? - I'm a telepath. I can sense thoughts, if I'm close enough, and I've been getting some very weird thoughts from one of the others. - The big guy there? - Not him. Her. Excuse me. Ma'am? What's your name? Hey. [GROANS] [GRUNTS] Everybody, get down! [BOY SCREAMS] - Can you get me above her? - Go! - Stay down. - WOMAN: We got you. THUNDERBIRD: Stop! DREAMER: So she was sent here as a spy? ECLIPSE: Something between a spy and a suicide bomber. She had a beacon in her bag she could've activated when we brought her in. It would've sent Sentinel Services right to our front door. She had weapons, too. Yeah, it sounds like the station in Perry was hit by another one of these, uh, things. SAGE: If Sentinel Services is planting these things out there, we may need to stop taking in refugees. THUNDERBIRD: You don't turn your back on desperate people because one of them might be dangerous. Reed... We should get on the road. Try and figure out whatever we can from your dad - before it's too late. - Yeah. Hey, what about Little Miss Vicious? THUNDERBIRD: We got to get what we can out of her. See if you can figure out who she is. Do you think you can handle this? Yeah. We'll be fine. - REED [QUIETLY]: Hey. - ANDY: See you. Bye, baby. I should be going with you. I know how hard this is gonna be, to see your dad after all this time, all the disappointments and... and the arguments... I can cross-examine a murder suspect, but the thought of having a conversation with my father for the first time in 20 years... I... I'm proud of you. Look, if talking to him helps protect us all from... this threat, then... it's a small price to pay. I'll keep them safe. I love you. I love you. [SIGHS] Hey, are you okay? My name's Clarice. What's your name? - Norah. - Norah. It was pretty rough back there. I know. Do you want to talk about it? If you change your mind, my bunk's right down there. Okay. Here. In case you get cold. Okay. It's gonna get worse for a second, and then it's gonna get better. - I have to pop it back in. - Hey. Want to look at me? Bite down on this. Really hard, okay? Three, two, one. - [ELBOW POPS] - [MUFFLED SCREAM] All right. There you go. All done. Better? All right, move your fingers. Hmm? Move your nose. [CAITLIN AND BOY LAUGH] All right. I think you're gonna be okay. - You got that? - Mm-hmm. - Let's get him a sling. - Yeah, a sling. Okay, you're in good hands. Good job. Yo, I'm Andy. We're gonna sing the sling song, okay? Join in anytime. [BEATBOXING] ♪ Sling... ♪ Let's see it. Okay. Let's see what we're working with here. It's really nothing. - I mean, if you need to help someone else or... - No. It's your turn. Um, I'm afraid you're gonna need some stitches. Keep some pressure on that. I heard you were a bit of a hero today. You're psychic? Yeah. Uh, sort of. I'm a telepath. I can feel thoughts if I'm close. Is that right? How about me? You're... concerned. About what's going on between mutants and humans. Yeah. I'm pretty sure everyone's concerned about that. And you don't want you and your husband to end up on the opposite side as your kids. Sorry. Uh, I don't mean to pry. Uh... No. [CHUCKLES] Just don't go looking into my college experimentations. It's a deal. [BOTH CHUCKLE] All right, well, now that you've read my mind, I feel like I should at least get your name. I'm Esme. - Hey. - Hi. [BOTH CHUCKLE] And, um, just so you know... people value you around here. [ESME CHUCKLES SOFTLY] POLARIS: She won't talk to us. Just smoke her. Get whatever memories you can. DREAMER: I really don't think this is gonna work. POLARIS: One way to find out. DREAMER: I'm not good at hitting moving targets. Even if she breathed it in, I think her metabolism is too fast for me to get anything. [POLARIS SIGHS] Yeah, so you're fast, but you don't have eyes in the back of your head. You gonna talk to us? Lorna! What are you doing? Just letting her know we're serious. ECLIPSE: You think she's gonna talk to you if you stab her? Put the knives down. Is this a joke? - What? - Weren't you the inquisitor for your cartel friends? What, it's okay when you do it for Carmen, - but it's not okay for us? - It's not... Look, it's hard to explain. It seems like a lot of things are hard for you to explain these days. Lorna... It's just up here. Your father runs an antique store? Thought he was a scientist. He took it over when he retired. He's big on living in the past. That's it. [MUSIC BOX PLAYING] [DOORBELLS JINGLE] Reed. Hello. I never thought I'd see you again. Well, I'm here. We need to talk. Listen, I want information as much as you do. Then why won't you help us get it? We're running out of time. She's not talking. You can make her talk. - It's not that simple, okay? - That right? From what I've heard about what you used to do, it sounded pretty simple. Lorna, one of the reasons I joined the Underground in the first place is so I don't have to do that kind of thing. I mean, you're asking me to burn someone. Now, I got enough nightmares as it is. - She tried to kill us. - I know that. But believe me, when you start down this road, it gets ugly. Look, I know you're mad. I know you're mad that I went to Carmen. I was not gonna leave you out there and let them do... - that... to you. - They're gonna do that to all of us if we don't figure something out. Me, you and the baby. Babe, don't-don't ever say that. - You... - [CELL BARS CLANK] ECLIPSE: Hang on. There might be something. - You see how she's acting? - Screwing up her manicure? One thing I saw a lot of with the cartel was drug addicts. - Do you think she's on something? - Yeah. Yeah, I do. CAITLIN: I can't be sure without examining her, but you could be right. She's got all the symptoms of withdrawal. Have you ever seen a mutant on Kick? - Um, what's Kick? - LAUREN: It's a mutant drug. I read about it. Boosts your powers for a while. Makes you feel invincible. Yeah, and it gets you hooked before you even know what hit you. CAITLIN: Well, if that's the case, we might be able to treat her. Wait a second. We're treating her? Why don't we just bring her a fruit basket while we're at it? If we treat her, she might be willing to cooperate. Yeah, or she might just get stronger and try to - kill us all again. - Can you just listen for one second? - Could you not be... - Stop it! Both of you. Let's try to remember, we're fighting for a world where people can actually live together. That starts here. [SIGHS] Now we just have to figure out a way to restrain her. She likes you. You know, Zingo... She's pretty particular about the people she likes. She likes me, too. You know why? It's 'cause we're special. We are. There's a lot of folks in here that just walk around, you can't even tell they're mutants. But not us. I got my eyes, my ears, you have your skin, and Zingo here is covered in fur. You're covered all in hair, aren't you, Zingo? Yeah. How'd you end up here? I mean, at the church. Mama D and I were making dinner... Mama D? Norah, were you at the foster home on Burnhill Road? Yes. The men with the guns... they came. I wanted to help. Every time... I go to bed, I see them. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. You should have called. I would have told you not to waste your time. Who is this? My name's John Proudstar, Thunderbird. Ah, Thunderbird. Very heroic. REED: He's with the Mutant Underground. - They've been helping my family. - OTTO: Is that so? The men from Sentinel Services came by. They seemed to think they were a terrorist organization. - We're not terrorists, sir. - No, no. Of course not. Freedom fighters, I'm sure. We're not here to have a political debate. [SIGHS] Did you hear what happened? At the school? Yes. They told me about it when they interrogated me. What'd you tell them? That I never met my grandchildren and haven't spoken to my son in years. In other words, the truth. We need to talk to you about your work at Trask. My work at Trask was classified. I'm your son. Son or not, it's a crime to reveal classified intelligence. It's also a crime to harbor a fugitive. I assume they covered this in law school. My kids are being hunted by Sentinel Services. This has nothing to do with me. - I have nothing to say. - You said for years that Trask was just a defense contractor. Trask no longer exists. I don't have any... It opened up again! And they are doing anti-mutant research. Now, you worked there for 30 years. And it just turns out that your grandchildren happen to be mutants. Do you expect me to believe that that's a coincidence? They're experimenting on mutants. My own best friend was turned, somehow. He's working for Sentinel Services. REED: Dad... I need you. Come. Upstairs. THUNDERBIRD: It's all right. Go. Your mother, Ellen, is she...? She's fine. She's still in Atlanta. We see her, um... well, we used to see her every couple of weeks. I miss her, you know. Does she know about all this? Some, yeah. They questioned her. Ah. The children, how old are they? Andy's 15 and... Lauren just turned 17. May I... may I see them? You have a... a photograph of something? I do, actually. This was taken last summer. Look, we don't have much time. Anything that you could tell me about Trask? There's nothing to tell. My research was peaceful. This project, whatever it is, - isn't my fault. - This isn't about blame. My family are fighting for their lives. OTTO: I told you, I don't know. I know I didn't mean much to you, but the kids mean everything to me... Don't you dare say that! Everything I did in my life was for you. Everything. What? The children... their powers. What can they do? Uh... [SIGHS] Lauren makes shields. Shields? What do you mean "shields"? She says it's like pushing the air together. And the other one? The boy, Andy? He kind of tears things apart. Oh, God. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Dad? What is it? I failed. It came back. SS AGENT: You're sure? All right. Keep me posted if things change. What's the situation? They've searched the entire area around Eternal Grace Church, sir. The asset is gone, and her surveillance beacon is inactive. And the mutants? There were signs of a struggle, but... I'm sorry. - Damn it. - Sir, if you're worried about the asset... With the mental conditioning, she can't tell them anything. They're mutants... She may not have to. They're wounded, wounded animals do desperate things. We have to assume we've been compromised. Contact headquarters, tell them I need an additional asset. We're going on a road trip. We're not giving up on this search just yet. Mom, you said she needs to be restrained, right? We can restrain her. Yeah, if I can push her against the bars, she can hold her back with a shield, and you can give her the sleep juice or whatever. [SIGHS] All right. Let's get this over with. I'm just guessing on the dosage. Hopefully, this knocks her out, but if something goes wrong... We'll all be ready. [SIGHS]: Okay. [BARS BANGING] ANDY: Lauren, now! I got her. Go! Okay. Okay. [PANTING] Well, that was exciting. [WELDER CRACKLING] LAUREN: She looks so small. Yeah, for real. Is she gonna be okay? She's used to massive doses of this drug they're giving her. This'll help, but I don't know for how long. I think she's dying. Well, if that's true, she's got no reason to give us anything. CAITLIN: Mm, you'd be surprised. I once treated a gang member with a fatal gunshot wound. As he was dying, he told the cops everything he'd done, just to get it off his chest. We have to hope she's in there, somewhere. OTTO: There's something you need to see. It's better you know everything. This is my father, Andreas von Strucker. My father and his sister Andrea did unspeakable things. They were terrorists. They were also mutants. This was all them? All of it... and more. What could they do? Apart, they had the same abilities as your children. Together, though... they were known as Fenris. The Wolf. And they were more powerful than you can imagine. [SIGHS] Wait. If they were mutants... Yes, Reed. Your children's mutations were inherited. I am a mutant. Wha...? - It's not possible. - Please, just let me finish. They tried to raise me to be like them, but I ran away. REED: That's you? OTTO: I hid my powers from everyone, even your mother. You have to understand, our family's abilities set us apart, even from other mutants. It was too much. I had to stop it. How could you possibly stop it? That was what brought me to Trask... A research project to eliminate the X-Gene. I never found what they wanted... A serum that worked on all mutants... But I made a version that worked on one mutant and gave it to you. [SOFTLY]: Wait. When I, when I was sick? Was that... It had to be done before any powers manifested. Dad, I-I... I nearly died. OTTO: You were in such pain. I hated myself. I could never look you in the eye after that. And all of it... for nothing. HULKING MUTANT: Are you people crazy? - Taking her out of the cage? - I get it, you're upset. But just stay back, okay? I don't understand why that thing is even here. - She gets loose, she can kill everyone. - They need to figure out who she is and where she came from. We need to keep everyone safe. We'll be safe when she's back in a cage where she belongs. Hey. Back off. - It's okay, Andy. - No, this guy has something to say, he'll say it to me. Right? [RUMBLING] Okay, cool off. Just... tell them to be careful down there. - We will. - All right, let's cool it, man. Thanks. No problem. You're my sister. Nobody talks to you like that but me. SAGE: I found something on the hard drives we got in Baton Rouge. I might know who she is... or was. Okay, so Miss Vicious is named Chloe? ECLIPSE: Well, anything of use? Maybe. She used to live in a trailer park outside of Jasper. Her kid got sick, and the pediatrician wouldn't treat mutants. She destroyed the doctor's office, got busted by Sentinel Services. [GASPING] CAITLIN: Chloe? Chloe, can you hear me? Chloe, I-I need you to listen to me. We-we need to... - It's not safe. - We're not gonna get through to her if we treat her like an animal. Chloe, we know you were arrested by the Sentinel Services. What did they do to you? I... Look, hey, it's okay. Please. Talk to us, we want to help. - [GASPS] Uh... - CAITLIN: Okay. Try to relax, just... Just tell us what you can. I think she wants to communicate, but I don't, I don't think she can talk. What do you mean, she can't talk? I don't know. It could be physical, it could be some sort of mental block. What the hell do we do? The telepath. [STAMMERS] Esme, she read her mind before. Maybe-maybe she could do it again. What did they do to you? REED: All that time, all those years. How could you not tell me? I was trying to give you a normal life. You had no right to keep it... To protect you? You're my son, I had no choice. These people are family. They were monsters, Reed. But just because we shared the same genes doesn't mean we were gonna... I couldn't take that chance. I couldn't. How much did my mother know? All she really knew was that I had secrets. That was what destroyed what I had with her. And with me. Yes. ♪ ♪ We need to talk about the children. What about them? Have they used their abilities together? A little. Since they found their powers... have they held hands? I... THUNDERBIRD: Reed! There's cars outside. I think it's Sentinel Services. Sir, with all due respect, we had Otto Strucker under surveillance for weeks. - We didn't get anything. - Yes, I've read the reports. At this point, we have to assume the mutants are aware of Trask. And if that's the case, they have every reason to be here. Well, we're putting a lot of pressure on them. I doubt they'd make a move like this. What you don't understand is a move like this is all they've got. Indulge me. Lock down the area. Watch this. [NECK POPPING] THUNDERBIRD: The mutant down there, that's my friend, the one they turned. He can suppress powers. Is there another way out of here? - Only the stairs. - No, we can't fight our way out, not with Pulse down there. They can cut me down same as you. I'll go down. - You can't. - I have to. Maybe I can do something. I told you, our family is different. I'm sorry, Reed. For everything. Tell your mother, will you? Take care of Lauren and Andy. Protect them, son. Protect the world from them. ♪ ♪ [MUSIC BOX PLAYING SIMPLE MELODY] Can I help you? I certainly hope so. Otto Strucker, yes? And you are? It is an honor, sir. Dr. Roderick Campbell. I'm a big admirer of your work. My work? I'm an antiques dealer. Before this, of course. I'm a fellow Trask man. I dug up your old research when the company was reestablished. Your work on suppressing the X-Gene was quite brilliant. It led directly to mine... enhancing it. As much as I would love to talk shop, however, I'm here on a different matter. - I'm looking for your son. - My son? We haven't spoken to each other for years. CAMPBELL: Is that so? [WHISPERING]: We have to go down there. We can't. It's suicide. Reed, we have people depending on us. The station. Your kids. I think you and your friend should leave. Oh, I'm afraid I can't do that. I know you told the investigators who came before that you were out of touch with your family. As a man of science, I'm sure you'll understand my need for verification. We're gonna search the place. - Send a team upstairs. - OTTO: No, you won't. - AGENT: Sir, sir, look! - I told you to lock this down! What's happening? I don't know. I... [GASPS] CAMPBELL: Shut him down! Shoot him! - No. - No. No! CAMPBELL: Get out! [EXPLOSION] [HIGH-PITCHED RINGING] [DISTORTED, ECHOING PANTING] [DISTORTED, ECHOING GASPS] [EXCITED CHATTER IN DISTANCE] AGENT: Don't worry, Dr. Campbell. We're gonna get you to a hospital. [TIRES SQUEALING] Come on! ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Gus? Sorry. I am, too, brother. I'm gonna make them pay for what they did to you. [FAINT GRUNTING] [GRUNTING STOPS] REED: We should go. [SIRENS WAILING IN DISTANCE] I'm sorry to spring this on you. I-I don't know what else to do. I don't think she has long. It's okay. I just hope I can help. - So, you think you can do this? - Maybe. You understand what we're fighting for, right? Sentinel Services have my family. I'm here to fight. CAITLIN: Don't worry. She's gonna help you. What are you getting? Need. And pain. ESME: Oh, God, it's... awful. You don't have to talk. Just think. [FAINT SHUDDERING] MAN: Get on the ground! Chloe, run! - CHLOE: Don't take my baby! Aah! - [DISTORTED GUNSHOTS] - Okay, what's happening? - Are you getting something? ESME: She wants you to know they killed her husband and took her daughter. Who-who did this to you? Where are they? She gave me a vision of it. I can see it. CAMPBELL [DISTORTED]: Like weapons. Win this war. ESME: It's a building. Some kind of lab. North of here. Well, can you find it? I-I think so. [SHUDDERING BREATHS] CAITLIN: Listen to me, Chloe. We will find the people who did this to you and make sure it never... [DYING EXHALE] ♪ ♪ Those don't look so good.

When I got sick and my portals went crazy, I kept trying to portal back there, and... that's how they found them. She watched them die, and now she can't stop dreaming about it. It's all my fault.
