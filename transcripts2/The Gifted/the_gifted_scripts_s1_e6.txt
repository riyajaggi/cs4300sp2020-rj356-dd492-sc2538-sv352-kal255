 Hello, this is Dr. Roderick Campbell. I know your team already uses some of our resources. I would like to propose a partnership of sorts. Listen, I appreciate the offer. I'm afraid it's out of the question. THUNDERBIRD: What did you do? DREAMER: I gave her a memory. THUNDERBIRD: Do you realize what you've done? Now I get to live with the memory of loving someone I barely know. Now, 7/15 started

 - as a peaceful protest. - Well, your peaceful protest killed my little girl. He knows what they did to Pulse. Let's see what I can find out. JACE: Grace wait up for me? Grace is gone. What do you mean? She died four years ago. Don't say that. ECLIPSE: Carmen, I need information. - What do you want from me? - The price is you. So if I call, then you do exactly what I ask you to do. BLINK: Something's interfering with the portal. THUNDERBIRD: Only thing I've ever known that can disrupt

 mutant abilities like that is... That's Pulse. He was my best friend. Pulse, it's me. It's John. POLARIS: Know what this is? I don't recognize that. But this building here... You know that place? That's the Federal Building in Baton Rouge. Some people I prosecuted were transferred there. - What happened to them? - I don't know. - They disappeared. - THUNDERBIRD: The answers about what happened to Pulse are in that building. THUNDERBIRD: Hi, ma'am. I'm a mutant veteran who served in Afghanistan. My father served in the Gulf before me. A lot of men I led were injured there. But right now we're trying to raise money for victims of the 7/15 disaster. So, anything you could do, I'd appreciate. My father'd appreciate. We'd all appre... Maybe another time. [SIGHS] You're raising money for Dallas? Is this a joke? A joke? No, it's not a joke. It's for people affected by the 7/15 incident. Affected by mutants. You got a lot of nerve. You attack this country, and now you ask for money? Hey, I defended this country! All right? I served two tours! You have any idea how many of us died over there? - John, John, forget about him. - Can you believe this? This guy's blaming us for what happened. Hey, he's an idiot. Don't let it get to you. [TIRES SQUEALING] MAN [ECHOING FAINTLY]: There they are. - Let's get 'em! - What is it? Get everybody away from the street. Everybody away! Get down! - [CROWD SCREAMING] - Hey, muties! Fire in the hole! [WOMAN SCREAMS] [CAR ALARMS WAILING] ♪ ♪ [KNOCKS] Hey. Am I interrupting? No, I was just thinking. I called around about Pulse. Now, nothing firm, but there are rumors of mutants hunting other mutants for Sentinel Services. Pulse may not be the only one. We are barely staying ahead of humans. If they turn us against each other, we're done. Anything more about the Federal Building - in Baton Rouge? - Yeah. I checked it out. Major mutant justice center for the Southeast. Reed Strucker worked with a judge there, so the guy might have info on the program. If we can get in, we might be able to figure out what the hell's going on. You mean break in? Well, they're not exactly gonna roll out the welcome mat for us. Look, John, I know this isn't how we usually do things, - but... - I don't care. What they did to Pulse, they changed their game. Maybe it's time we changed ours. Man, all these refugees. Glad we beat the rush. At least we got, like, actual beds. You do realize we're the reason there is a rush, right? Sentinel Services have been freaking out over us. It's kind of all our fault. Yeah, thanks for the guilt trip. You want to give up your bed? I know. Shut up and get more water. Good boy. Hey. Are there any other flavors? Besides Salisbury steak? They're all the same. Okay, wait. You take care of refugees? What's your name? My name is "I have work to do." What if you were already done? [LAUGHS SOFTLY] I'm Wes. Nice to meet you... Wes. [EXHALES] [SIGHS] Skyler, your blood pressure's high. Any idea why that would be? How often do you use your powers? I don't know. Two or three times a day? Whenever I have to find food. That much? I... How long has that been going on for? Couple years. Some other mutant kids and me found a place under I-85 until the Sentinels came after us. Well, I want you to go get some food, okay? Okay. POLARIS: Not bad. Have you ever trained? Not really. You're training now. They'll get you some clothes downstairs. Uh, excuse me. You're planning to train all these kids for what, exactly? Combat. - [CHUCKLES] Seriously? - Yeah. They're being hunted. Seemed more relevant than knitting. [ZINGO PANTING] THUNDERBIRD: Clarice. There's a Federal Building in Baton Rouge that we need to get into. I know it's a lot to ask, but we think there might be information in there about Sentinel Services and what they did to Pulse. So, is that all? That's all we need to talk about? You need the 411 on your old Marine buddy, so I just blink you into a building? I'm just a portable door-maker? - [SCOFFS] - Fine. If you're not gonna bring it up, I will. Your friend Dreamer stuck a memory in my head without mentioning it to me or, I don't know, asking my permission. A memory that I'm sure you're familiar with because it's a memory of you. All right. I'm sorry. - I asked her not to do that, but... - But when she did, - you decided not to say anything about it. - It was an emergency. She did it to save the team. And afterwards, we still needed your help. Oh. Ah, I get it. You didn't want to tell me because you wanted to use me. FYI, you're not making this any better. I've got my own issues to sort out. My own people to find. Hey. Maybe-maybe I can help you - do this. - I'm not asking for your help. I just want to know. When we were working together in the warehouse and we were alone... The way you looked at me. Was that real? Um, it's complicated. - [SIGHS] - Well, lucky you. I'm gonna help make this a lot less complicated. [ZINGO WHIMPERS] Clarice, come on. [SIGHS] Clarice! [EXHALES] Listen, everybody needs to understand something here. This isn't just about hiding mutants anymore. We are taking the fight to the enemy now. It's a matter of survival. Reed, can you tell us about this building? REED: I wish I knew more. Some of my cases were transferred to Baton Rouge. There's a judge there, James Kresge. He dealt with most of my cases. And how many folks you prosecuted disappeared - through this place? - It was rare. All they told me was that some of my cases were being prosecuted under a special federal program. And you never asked for more information why? We're not debating this. Look, what matters now is getting those files. If Clarice can get us in, then... That's not an option. Clarice, uh... she left. - She's gone. - POLARIS: What, she just left? - Why would she do that? - DREAMER: It doesn't matter. We need another solution. I could try to get us into the back of the building. That's reinforced concrete. Cutting through this is gonna take at least half an hour. Then I'll have to do it a lot faster. - It's not possible. - ANDY: I can get us through. Andy. What? It's a wall. I can handle a wall, no problem. You and I should talk - about this when... - Are we really gonna do this again? Talk about how only the adults can do anything? You said it yourself. It's a matter of survival, right? Yeah, so, if the Sentinel Services did track us down, the kids would be just as screwed as the adults, if not more. I can get us through that wall quicker than anybody else here. It's time you let me fight. Pee bucket. - Scalpel. - [CHUCKLES] You okay with this? Bringing Andy? I don't know. Maybe... maybe it's a good thing. We haven't been connecting since I got out of prison. Oh. Nothing says "father-son bonding" like breaking into a federal building. This is our best shot. I get it. Doesn't mean I like it. Hey. Be careful, all right? I wish I could be there. Yeah, I'll miss you, too. Look, John, we got this. And you're needed here. We'll be okay. All right. Stuff's all loaded. Are we ready? Andy, stay close to your dad. ANDY: Not like I have a choice. We're gonna be stuck inside that truck. See ya. Hey. They took my wedding ring. In prison. I'm sorry. We haven't even talked... I know, I know. We will. Just come back safe. Everything okay? Just watching my dad and brother get ready to leave. It's weird. Three weeks ago, our craziest family outing was... Six Flags. I'm sure they'll be fine. I'm not sure about anything anymore. Do you, uh... do you want to talk about it? Maybe another time. Should get back to work. - [ELEVATOR DINGS, OPENS] - WEEKS: Whoa. Hey. Agent Turner, what are you doing here? - You're not supposed to be here. - You know what it's like to lose your only daughter twice? You have no idea what I've been through. What are you looking at, Suarez? Jace. When was the last time you slept? - You're in no condition to be at work. - Where else - would I be? - You're on a mandatory leave of absence. Everybody's heart broke for you and for Paula. But you're not supposed to be here. [BEEP, CLICK] You gonna call security? Tell 'em I'll be in my office. [HANDLE TURNS, DOOR OPENS] - [EXHALES] - [PHONE BEEPS] - [CLEARS THROAT] - [LINE RINGING] I need to speak to Dr. Campbell. ECLIPSE: You guys might want to get some rest. We've got a long ride to Baton Rouge. ANDY: Maybe later. [BEATBOXING] I haven't heard you do that for a while. Yeah. Guys at school used to think it was weird. We didn't get a chance to talk about what was going on for you at school. You know, I tried to help. I went to see your guidance counselor. Yeah, I know. You know that's... the whole reason those guys came after me that night in the gym, right? I wish you'd talked to me about it. Before it got that bad. Like when? At midnight, when you got home? Maybe there's a chance we can talk about it now. Now, when we're in the back of a hot truck, peeing in a bucket. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] I don't think we should let the pee bucket - come between us, huh? - [CHUCKLES] - [SIREN WHOOPS] - Listen, I just... [SIREN WHOOPS] OFFICER [OVER SPEAKER]: Pull over. [BRAKES SQUEAK, HISS] [WHISPERING]: Cops. Quiet. - License and registration. - Yeah, sure. [EXHALES] OFFICER: Gonna need you to open the back up. THOMAS: Just... some relocation boxes for some sales VP. Well, I'm gonna need to see 'em. [CHUCKLES] I'm-I'm really running late to Denver. OFFICER: Your name showed up on a list we got from Sentinel Services. Let's go. If he tries to come in, I can fight him off. Fight him off? Absolutely not. Shh. Both of you, turn off the lights. I might be able to hide us. REED: There's nowhere to go. I absorb light before I emit it. If I can absorb enough... OFFICER: Then you got nothing to worry about... Stay quiet. OFFICER: Any, uh, agricultural products? [MUFFLED, INDISTINCT CHATTER] [SIGHS] OFFICER: That's a long haul to Denver. You making any stops? OFFICER: Anything back here I should know about? THOMAS: Just, uh... just hate that I'm gonna be so late. OFFICER: Open it. [STRAINING] DISPATCHER: Unit 17, we have a call at mile marker 51. Officer requesting assistance. Copy that, I'll be en route. Okay. Drive safe. Thank you. [GROANING] [SIGHS, GROANS] Maybe a little to the left. Figured it was time we started thinking about reinforcing this place. So, you never told me, how did your conversation go with Clarice? She left. So I'd say not well. It's about par for the course these days. If you're talking about Pulse, that wasn't your fault. How do you figure that? I left him. I let Sentinel Services take him. - You thought he was dead. - I was wrong. I should've saved him. I'm starting to think that maybe the X-Men made a mistake... Choosing me to be part of the underground. Johnny, you can't think that way. I know you want to live up to who your father was, but you're doing all you can. It's not enough. We have more refugees in there than we can possibly save. I can barely protect a bunch of veterans. You were chosen for a reason. The X-Men said a war is coming. They didn't say we'd win. So, we're definitely staying tonight, though, right? - Yeah. - Okay. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATION] Looks like we're here through tomorrow. Guess there are a lot of police on the road. [SIGHS] We always used to talk about going camping. And here we are... the wilderness. [LAUGHS] Maybe we could go swimming in that puddle behind the bathrooms later. May I ask you something? Does it hurt... when you use your power? Um, not really. Why? I was watching Marcos earlier, and... I saw how much it took out of him. It's not really like that for me. It's more like... yelling. Y-You know, you have to put something into it, but it's not, like... it's worth it when it happens. Actually feels kinda good when I rip stuff apart. - Just forget it. - No, Andy... Sorry. I... [SIGHS] It's just that what you do, you know, it could hurt someone. Kill someone. So I'm just supposed to sit around and never use my power? I'm finally good at something, and you're just telling me not to do it. I just want you to be proud of me. All I want you to do is use good judgment. Reed? Our driver has a question about tomorrow's route. Uh-uh, okay, I just... Andy and I just need a second. No, it-it's fine. I'm going to get something to eat. [SIGHS] - Something you're looking for? - Oh... John said I might find some schoolbooks in here, but I'm not sure how it's organized. Well, it's not. Stuff just kinda piled up. Right. Well, we could start a nifty thrift shop. [LAUGHS] Here. I think this is what you're looking for. What are you going to do with them? I want to get a school started for Andy and Lauren. For all the refugee kids. How did you get these books? Sentinel Services like to grab families when they're picking the kids up from school. Get them all at once. - [SHATTER GRUNTS] - [DOOR OPENS] Okay, guys, just remember, in the real world, you'll be playing for keeps. Which means we play for keeps in here. - You ready? - Uh-huh. Three, two... POLARIS: Not bad. - I'll go next. - Okay. You think this is a joke? Whatever. You guys don't understand. You're going to need to depend on each other just to survive. You wanna make it out there? You gotta work hard in here. Lauren, you're up next. Uh... What do you think you're doing? That's my daughter. Yeah, and she's training right now. - Uh... [LAUGHS] - If this hits you, it's going to hurt... You might want to step back. Step back? I don't recall giving you permission to hurl saw blades at my kid. [QUIETLY]: Mom! What, do you want her to get a learner's permit? She's got powers. She needs to know how to use them. Well, not like this. Sorry, Lauren. Mom, please. Let's go. ECLIPSE: Hey. I didn't mean to eavesdrop before. But I heard you talking about his powers. Yeah. Not sure I did a great job, there. Keep at it. It'll be easier for him if he has someone to talk to. Especially his father. Did you always want to be a dad? Yeah. Yeah, I guess I did. You're gonna be a father. How 'bout you? [SIGHS] I don't know. I didn't know my dad much, really, even before he kicked me out for being a mutant. I was the oldest. Supposed to run the family business, make him look good. Safe to say I disappointed him. Listen, if we all turned out just like our fathers, I wouldn't be much of a dad myself. Yeah. Then how'd you figure it out? You know, parenting. I haven't. But I can tell you this. Nothing that they can do would make you love 'em less. You start there and then... you do the best you can. Agent Turner. I've reached out to some friends on Capitol Hill to get you reinstated and reassure them that you are committed to the cause. Really? Thank you. One more thing. Uh, we discussed the Strucker children in one of our early conversations, - if you recall. - Yeah, I remember. At the time, that information was restricted. Well, I trust now that we're working together, it won't be a problem for me to access their files. Of course, I can call back my friends in Washington and tell them you're not ready. JACE: No, that won't be necessary. Good. Whatever you have. Send it to my office. I'll send it right over. Well, in that case... let's get to work. [DOOR CLOSES] ECLIPSE: Hey, babe. So we got to the courthouse in Baton Rouge, and it's a little more well-protected than we thought. [SIGHS] How little is "little"? Uh, we had to find a different entry point. Andy thinks he can get us in through the parking garage of the building next door. It shares a wall with the courthouse. You sure the kid's not gonna bring down the entire building? Well, he's green, but he can handle it. Be careful, all right? I will. How's the baby? [CHUCKLES] Oh, what, you miss the kid already? I could send you a picture of me throwing up in the morning, - if you want. - Hey, I'll take it. Love you, babe. Love you. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] [SIGHS] Lorna. I know you're trying to help these kids. But isn't the idea to give these people a future? Lives after the fighting? Yeah, it's a nice idea. But they might be fighting the rest of their lives. That's not what I want for my kids. Look, what your kids can do... It's way beyond what we usually see. Their power is incredible. Okay? They need to develop... They need some sort of normalcy. They're mutants. This... This is their new normal. LAUREN: Where are we going? Office furniture graveyard. It's cool, right? Come hang for a sec. I told my mom I'd be right back. You will. You're just taking a break. Anyway... What was up with her? She did not like us training with Magnet Girl. I don't know. - She's still weird about my powers. - Hmm. She didn't even know what I was until a few weeks ago. Nobody did. Wait, so... so you've just been hiding? Why? Haven't you ever wanted a normal life? Honestly, though, what you did... Hiding who you were all that time... That sounds worse. It sucked. Pretending like everything was great. Counting down the days till graduation so I could move to... Florence. Or something. I guess that's never gonna happen. Welcome to Florence. Wow. Even the water's moving. Yeah, I-I've... never done that before. I think you're making me better. One thing, though... Isn't this Rome? I think that's the Vatican. - Oh. - [LAUGHS] Oh, well... My bad. I, um, I just saw it on a commercial. It's beautiful. Mm-hmm. CAITLIN [IN DISTANCE]: Lauren! Lauren! I should go. Most of the building's sealed off, so it'll take 'em longer to get to us. It'll still be tight, though. You can break that wall, we're in. Okay, kid. You're up. Let's do this. [WALL CREAKING] [GRUNTS] [CAR ALARMS WAILING] Andy, Andy, what are you doing? You gotta get back to the truck. Did you see that? I can rock this. We do not have time for this. We have to get in there now. Stick to the plan. Go. ECLIPSE: Let's go. [WHISPERING]: It's this one. [FIRE ALARM STARTS BEEPING] ECLIPSE: Hurry up, get the mutant files. I think I've got them. You done, there? Yeah. Yeah, that's everything. You get the hard drives? ECLIPSE: It's gonna take a minute. Won't do us any good if I melt them. [TIRES SCREECH IN DISTANCE] AGENT [IN DISTANCE]: Come on, let's go! - Second floor! Let's go! - Go, go. They're coming. How much longer? I'm almost in. Here we go. Got 'em. We need to go, now. Come on! Come on. - What are you doing? - What do you think? - Covering our tracks. - You can't. I can't what? These people are trying to kill us, man. You want to leave 'em a thank-you note? THUNDERBIRD: Hey. Just got word from HQ in Alpharetta. - What happened... they get hit? - Yeah. They managed to get about half of their people out. They're on their way here now. Here? We're already over capacity - by at least 78%. - Yeah, well, that number's about to get a lot worse. Guys, I'm sorry. We don't have a choice here. We need to do something. We got to find space for 'em. - Okay. - You got it. All right. [THUNDERBIRD SIGHS] Hey. Are you all right? Yeah. Yeah, I'm all right. How'd it go with Marcos in Baton Rouge? They got what they went there for. Without Clarice? I guess not everything requires a portal. [EXHALES] What you did... what we did to her, it was wrong. Was it? Because it saved lives. We kept the truth from her. If we had told her earlier, she would have left earlier, and people would have died. [SOFTLY]: Johnny... it's okay. It's okay that you made it out and Pulse didn't. You have to keep moving forward. ♪ ♪ We can't do this. Why not? Because... Because we're in a war? That just means all we have is here and now. [PHONE RINGING] [WHISPERS]: It's Marcos. Uh... Where are you? MARCOS: We're almost back. THUNDERBIRD [OVER PHONE]: That's good. - Yeah, I'm not so sure it is. - ANDY: He's still there. - Two cars back. - We've had a cop trailing us the last couple miles. No sirens, but something doesn't feel right. - Has anything come up on the scanners? - No, nothing. He's on his radio. Check the traffic agency public notices to see if there's any directives to avoid Buford Highway. REED: Is there anything? Uh... Yeah. THUNDERBIRD: Yeah, there is. They know we're coming. They're heading straight into a police ambush. We think it'll happen here. LAUREN: Why can't they just go somewhere else? There's no place to go. They're hemmed in. How did this happen? I thought they got away. - I-I thought that... - The cops stopped them on the way up there. They didn't find anything, but the driver said he was going to Denver, so when the tollway cameras in Baton Rouge spotted them... Well, how do we get them out of there? We can't just leave them. Wes can help. You saw him at training. He can make illusions, mirages, if they need to get away from the police. That could work. I'll go get him. I want to go, too. If it doesn't work out, you'll need me. Go. Go, before I change my mind. Okay, we're coming. We'll have eyes on you in a second. ECLIPSE [OVER PHONE]: I don't want you guys getting caught. Trust me. We'll stay out of sight, okay? ECLIPSE: Remember, we don't know for sure the cops are onto us. It might be nothing. - Bad news. - [SIREN WAILING] It's not nothing. [INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER] We're in position. Contact in approximately two minutes. POLARIS: They're here. We can't turn around. They're right behind us. Marcos, tell the driver to keep going. You understand? Do not stop. We'll handle the rest. Are you sure? Trust me. Polaris has a plan. [KNOCKING ON TRUCK CAB] ECLIPSE: Thomas, whatever happens in front of you, just keep driving. LAUREN: How are they gonna get through that roadblock? Your shields. They strong enough for a truck to drive over? I don't know. I've never tried. You just need to focus. You don't think about anything. Forget about everything but the target. I'll tell you when. After that, it's all you. I've never done anything that big. Then dig deeper. POLARIS: Here it comes. Stop the vehicle immediately, or we will open fire. This is Sentinel Services. So, we're just gonna sit in here and do nothing? We need to stay calm. Dad, they said they were gonna kill us! - We've got a plan. - But I can help! Keep it together, kid. REED: Andy, listen to me. We know you can help. You've already proven that. Your power is not the answer to everything. Right now, the answer is for us to be a team. Okay? WEEKS: I repeat, stop the vehicle immediately, or we will open fire. This is Sentinel Services. Wait for it. Wait for it. Prepare to open fire. [GUNS CLICKING, MEN SHOUTING] - [ENGINE REVS] - Fire! - POLARIS: Now. - [GRUNTS] [TRUCK CREAKING] [GRUNTING] You okay? Andy? [WHOOPS] WEEKS: Go! All units, in pursuit! - [SHOUTING] - Move, move, move! POLARIS: Wes, now! - Go! Go! - [TIRES SCREECHING] [SIRENS WAILING] [TIRES SCREECHING] What if they follow the right truck? What truck? [CHUCKLES] [PANTING] JACE: All right, everybody, listen up. We believe that the mutants from the roadblock were part of the same cell that broke into the federal building in Baton Rouge. They stole vital classified information... and we are going to hunt them down. I want surveillance on all cell phones within a 50-mile radius of the roadblock site. Monitor target names, keywords, repeated phrases, anything that sounds like coded communication. SS TECH: What numbers? - What'd you say? - I said "what numbers." - All of them. Was I unclear? - But without a court order... - But according to the... - I don't give a damn about a court order, I want it done! - Any questions? - WOMAN [QUIETLY]: No, sir. Get to work. - Mm. - Hey. That looks like a good dinner, there. [LAUGHS] You put in just the right amount of water. - Not my first can of soup. - [LAUGHS SOFTLY] Takes me back to law school. Really? This is just like law school. [LAUGHS] I missed you, while you were on your road trip. Yeah? [GASPS] I got you something. There's a storage room with a bunch of old stuff and... Wow. I thought this might work as a replacement. - It's beautiful. - Mm-hmm. It reminded me of you. [CHUCKLES] What do you think? Maybe we could have that talk now. Maybe you should talk to him first. CAITLIN: Mm. REED: Hey. Let me make something clear. I have always been proud of you. Always. You hear me? Yeah. Whatever it is that you're thinking, you can tell me. I want to hear. No matter what. I'm thinking... you should be the shoe. Of course. I'm always the shoe. Yeah. [LAUGHS SOFTLY] ♪ ♪ [TRAIN RUMBLING] [PHONE VIBRATING] - Hey. - Hmm. Hello? CARMEN [OVER PHONE]: It's me. Catch you at a bad time? Carmen? What do you want? I'm collecting on our agreement. I call, you come. Remember, mi amor? I helped you rescue your magnet girl. Time for you to pay me back. And if you don't, my next call is to Sentinel Services.
