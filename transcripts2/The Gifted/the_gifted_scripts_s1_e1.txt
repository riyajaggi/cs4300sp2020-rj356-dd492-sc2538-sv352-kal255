 What the...? [pops, crackles] [train horn droning] [dog barking] You getting anything? Working on it. Yeah, you seriously think she's here, man? I mean, she was just two miles away. [ding, whoosh] [siren blaring, panting] She's close. Closer than the last time she was close? [laughs] She's moving... strangely. Yeah, I'm pretty sure he just likes keeping us out in the cold. [laughs] [high-pitched tone sounds] Look. [soft, high-pitched tone sounding] There. Well, that's interesting. Told ya. Hey, you all right? - Want me to warm you up? - I'm okay. You can warm me up later, though. Oh, I'm gonna hold you to that. She's there. Inside. [thudding, rattling] Hey... go. [woman panting loudly] - It's okay. We're just gonna talk. - Oh. [Gasps] - Okay. Well, hey, hold up. - [grunts] No. Wait a minute! Okay. Whoa. Whoa. [panting] Calm down, all right? You with the cops? I can't go back. We're not cops, okay? We heard you broke out of the mutant detention center and we came looking. I don't understand. Who are you? Just a couple of freaks, same as you. Look, I'm Marcos, this is Lorna. Now, trust me, we have all been where you are, or worse. We can help. Now come with us. - We can get you some place safe... - Guys! There's trouble. Come on, get dressed. You're with us now. MARCOS: What is it? MAN: Cops. Coming fast this way. Kill the lights. - How many? - [whooshing] At least ten, from the west and south. [sirens blaring] [tires squealing] OFFICER [over loudspeaker]: This is the Atlanta Police Department. We know the fugitive is in the building. Come out now, or we will open fire. OFFICER 2: The window! One suspect at the window! [whooshing, whirring, popping] [indistinct, overlapping chatter] OFFICER: Open fire! [gunfire, glass breaking] - Lorna! - I'm fine. Find us a way out! [glass breaking] [gunfire] [glass breaking] [indistinct shouting] [gasps, mutters] [grunting] [indistinct shouting] Lorna! Get out of there! Go! Go! [high-pitched trilling] [man groaning] [high-pitched trill] Come on! Over here! [gunshot] [Marcos groans] LORNA: Marcos! - [yells] - God! [groans] [Lorna roaring] Lorna! Come back! Come, come back! [yelling] - Freeze! - [Lorna groaning, electrical hissing] [Lorna screaming] [electricity crackles, man groans] MARCOS: Lorna! Stop! - LORNA: No! - OFFICER: Put your hands behind your back! - Marcos! - Lorna! MAN: I understand you have some concerns about your son, Andy? Yes, we believe he's being bullied. Belleview High has a zero tolerance policy towards bullying. That's why we came. Um, Andy and I have always been very close, but lately he... he just stopped talking to me. It's affecting his grades. He-He's not sleeping. In situations like this, we like to use the "CARE" system... communicate, adjust, reconcile and empathize. First, we take the kids, and we put them together to talk. These boys are-are tormenting our son. I understand that's upsetting. Stop right there. Let me be clear. Andy needs help, and if he doesn't get it, I will sue this school into oblivion. Mr. Strucker, we have procedures. I can't... Then get someone who can. Now. Okay, I'll-I'll be right back. [door opens] Wow. Scary. [chuckles] Was it too much? I felt like the glaring was a little over the top. No. That was the perfect amount of glaring. [phone buzzes] Ugh. I got to go to Garland. Plea conference with a suspect. They need me there ASAP. Will you tell the kids I'm really sorry? I'll be back tomorrow. The kids understand. You're keeping us safe. I love you. I love you, too. - Bye. - Bye. ♪ If I told you I loved you... ♪ You have no preference? They are two completely different outfits. I don't know. I'm sorry. You look good in both. Not helpful, Jack. Now just pick an outfit. [sighs] I don't know. Um... CAITLIN: I'm home! The blue one. Do the blue one. That one looks nice. Also, uh, do you want me to pick you up? Because it's no problem. No, but I'll push for an 11:30 curfew. - I'll see you tonight. - Bye. So, Lauren, how was choir? Good. We're practicing for the spring concert. Are you still going to the dance tonight? Want me to show you some of my moves? - No, thank you. - [laughs] How about you? How was your day? Uh, bad. I mean, you were there. [laughs] I meant your classes. Anything interesting? We had a debate in social studies about the law they want to make to test people with the X-gene and, like, monitor them. I don't know. Anyway, this one kid was, like, freaking out. I guess his cousin's a mutie or something. Mutie, Andy? Racist much? What? Person of genetic difference. You are such an ass! Okay, please. You're fighting about social studies class now. Can we not have a normal conversation? [sighs] Guess not. _ [lock buzzes] Ms. Dane? My name is Reed Strucker. This is my associate, Carla Jackson. I'd offer you a seat, but, uh, you know. You're accused of the attempted murder of two police officers. That plus the enhanced sentencing for the use of your mutant abilities. Equals I'm screwed. Yeah, I got that. We can reduce the charges in exchange for your cooperation. Look, all I know is, I was walking in the rain, and some cops shot at me. Come on, Ms. Dane. You and your associates in the mutant underground have aided and abetted dozens, if not hundreds, of fugitives. [trilling] - Reed. - It's okay. [high-pitched, rhythmic trilling] Believe it or not, I'm trying to help you. These are serious charges. Attempted murder... [hissing] Those screws in your knee... old sports injury? - [groans] - If I wanted to, I could tear out those screws and show you some attempted murder. [groans] Believe me, if I wanted those cops dead, they'd be dead. There's a factor you may not be aware of. I am gonna ask the court to assign you a lawyer, okay? You've got a big decision to make, Ms. Dane. Son of a bitch. No, no, no, no. No. [Sobs] No! No! [shouting] [cries] Give it some thought. CAITLIN: Be home at 11:30! I know, I know. I love you. Yo. What are you doing here? I snuck out. I thought I'd go with you. Didn't you tell Mom you were going to bed? Yeah, that's why they call it sneaking. Can we go? You can't. What if she finds out? If I get caught, I'll tell her I was going down to lan's. You won't get in trouble. When was the last time I got to go out on a weekend? It's like I'm a... one-one of those baby cows they keep in the crates. Veal? Yeah. I'm being raised like a veal. You really want to go to a dance? After everything that's been going on at school? You mean my fan club? [sighs] Yeah, whatever. I'm used to them. [groans] Buckle up.

Anyone we should contact? Family? No. My family... It's complicated. SAGE: Right. Well, look, you'll stay here with us for a few days, lay low, and then we will figure out where to move you. Yeah. Thank you. Hold still. Almost done. I'm fine, John. We need to go after Lorna. We get a team together, we... And do what? Huh? Get one of us killed? Marcos, we barely got away from a dozen cops. Now you want to take on a hundred? We can't take that risk - right now. - Then when? [sighs] The X-Men, the Brotherhood, we don't even know if they exist anymore. We are alone. And we are getting picked off one by one. Look around. We'd be risking all these people. Everything we built. Everything Lorna built. Guys, we got a situation. - What is it? - REPORTER: Yes, and as we have reported, we've got breaking news on the attack at Belleview High. We believe two young mutants to be responsible for this act of terrorism. We've also heard the federal authorities will be getting involved. Well, if it wasn't too hot before, it sure as hell is now. I'm sorry. ANDY: It started happening. I couldn't stop it. I was just so angry. Oh, Andy, I... I mean, I-I can't believe you di... you didn't feel anything? I just can't believe there wasn't any warning. Mom, accept it... Andy is a mutant. That's how mutant abilities first appear... it's moments of stress or danger. Dad talks about this - all the time. - Lauren, I... we-we all know about your father's work. I-I just don't... see how that suddenly makes you an expert. Mom, I know because... How do you think we got out of that gym? What are you saying? I got us out. You, too? LAUREN: Remember when we were coming back from that concert at church? And the truck almost hit us? [horn honking] [tires screeching] For weeks, you were saying it was a miracle we didn't die. Mom... it wasn't a miracle. [exhales] That was three years ago. Honey, why... why didn't you tell me? Don't you think I tried? You can always talk to me. Always. Your-your dad, too. Whatever your issues. Are you serious? Dad puts people like us in jail. No, no, no, he prosecutes criminals. [sniffles] He-he... he's not against... mutants. It's-it's just the ones who hurt people. You mean the ones like me. [doorbell rings] [heavy knocking] Oh. I'll get it. - Come here. - Just stay here. [crickets chirping] Good evening. Mrs. Strucker, right? I'm Jace Turner. I'm with the Sentinel Services. We're a government agency. We deal with genetically-related... I'm familiar with it. I'm here about Andrew and Lauren. You're aware that there was a... bit of an incident at the school this evening? Yeah. I-I heard. I need you to go get 'em for me. They're not going anywhere. They need an attorney. My-my husband is a prosecutor. We're aware of that. Actually, under the amended Patriot Act, we have to secure the safety of the community first. - What does that mean? - It means they're coming - with us. - Just... for now. These are my children. You-you can't just cart them off. Listen, Mrs. Strucker, all right, I'm a father myself. Okay? I know how difficult this must be for you. But you have to understand, - this is partially for their protection. - For their protection? Okay, let's not make this harder than it has to be. - Please step aside. - No, this is my home! - You can't just come in here! - Ma'am... - Yes, we can. - Do not make this harder... - Yes, we can. - You're not getting... [grunts] ANDY: Get away from my mom! Okay. [Nervous chuckle] Andrew, Lauren, listen to me. You need to calm down. You're gonna have to come with us. All right? We just have a few questions. Get out of our house now! [rumbling] Run! Go! Go! Go! Go! [starts engine] [click] - [pounding on door] - LAUREN: Mom, they're coming! [screams] LAUREN: Andy, what you did before... do it! - [grunts loudly] - [gunshots] - [screams] - I can't! It's not working! Drive! I can't see! [tires squeal] REED: Caitlin, Caitlin, slow down. If there was a mutant attack at the school, why were there people at the house? You don't understand. I-I... I-I-I don't even know where to begin. There's-there's so much. Just tell me, are the kids safe? Yeah. I mean... - for now, but... - And-and the mutants, the ones that attacked them, did they... They weren't attacked by mutants, Reed. That's what I'm trying to say. Andy and Lauren... are... mutants. ♪ ♪ Oh, my God. Uh, Caitlin, Caitlin, uh... tell me where you are. _ REED: The important thing is, everyone's all right. Andy... was anyone actually hurt? I don't know. Okay? I-I don't remember it. It was just... it was all confusing. So, to be clear, - you didn't touch them before they touched... - LAUREN: Yes, Dad, they came after him. - And after they came at you... - This isn't a deposition, Reed. I am trying to understand the situation. Legally, if they... I don't think it matters. The man from Sentinel Services... Wait, Sentinel Services? You mean the police? No. Sentinel Services. They were just gonna take Lauren and Andy. You can't talk to Cal? He's the D.A. - He could... - This is way beyond Cal's jurisdiction. Sentinel Services is a federal agency. The only reason you got away is they didn't have enough time to put a full team together. We, uh... [whispers]: We have to go. Now. Um... Okay, we-we could call Jenny. I am not talking about staying at your sister's condo in Phoenix for a few days. I mean, we have to go somewhere where the mutant laws are looser. Like... Mexico or... Mexico? Everything we own is at the house. The last time Sentinel Services got involved with one of my cases, the suspect disappeared. I am not gonna let that happen to us. I'm gonna figure something out, I promise. There is nothing more important to me than my family. _ Walk me through what you need from us again, please. We're gonna need access to Mr. Strucker's office, his computer, his e-mail. And you realize there may be confidential information related to cases? Court order's being prepared. JONES: I understand... I got to say, though, I do find it hard to believe he would just run. I mean, he's been with this office for 15 years, the mutant task force for the last five. JACE: In my experience, things change when it's your own kid. [phone rings] This is Carla. REED: Carla, it's me. Reed, where are you? What's going on? Sentinel Services is upstairs in our offices. I know. That's why I'm calling. I need your help. Help? What do you need? I need the case file for the mutant network investigation. [quietly]: What? Are you serious? That's... I don't know what else to do. I have to get my family someplace safe. If I can contact them, they might be able to help. Reed, you've done a lot for me. I owe my career to you, but this is an open case... I could get disbarred. I could get arrested. This is my children, Carla, please. LAUREN: I know this, like, sucks, but honestly, it's a relief to finally be able to talk to Mom and Dad about it. Guess all it took was me ruining our lives. - Andy. It wasn't your fault. - If it wasn't for me, we wouldn't even be here... I mean, I nearly got us killed, and then last night with the car, I could have actually helped, and I-I couldn't even do anything. [sighs] It gets better. At first, it's like... it's like a sneeze... something that just happens. You have to work at it. What does it feel like when you...? You know when you put your hand out of the window of a moving car? You can feel the air and, like... guide it? Yeah. I can... push the air together. With water, too, other stuff... it's just... harder. What about you? I don't know. I-I was looking at those guys, and I just... wanted to push everything away, you know? Well, I'd say you did a pretty good job of that. A-plus. First A-plus I've ever gotten. [laughs] Hey. Who taught you how to swim? You. I can teach you this. Watch. Dude! Now you try. Take it slow. Focus... on how you felt. Okay? [low rumbling] [rumbling fades] That's good. That's awesome. [rumbling] Andy, that's enough. Andy. LAUREN: Andy! Andy! [gasps] [whispers]: Oh, my God. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. We got to go. We got to go. Go! _ Is that your dog? - [whines] - MARCOS: She's, uh... she's everybody's, really. I just wanted to say... thanks for, you know, saving me. Even though I threw a coffeepot at your head. And a mug. And a mug. [exhales sharply] Don't worry about it. So... this group... you guys run it? No. The network's nationwide. Founded after the anti-mutant laws first got bad. Just before the X-Men disappeared. What about this place? Uh, it's been abandoned since Oakwood. Figure it's the last place they'd look. I got brought into this station by, uh, John and... and by Lorna. I guess this has something to do with getting her out of jail? Yeah. Well... that was the idea. Should work great, as long as they have no guards or cameras... Or smoke detectors? Yeah. For what it's worth, uh... I know you lost her helping me, and I'm... I'm sorry. That's all right... wasn't your fault. [groans] You got yourself out of prison using some kind of portal, right? You think you could get someone in? It doesn't work like that. It's bad if I try to go someplace that I can't see, someplace I haven't been. What do you mean by bad? [crackling, whooshing] [panting] [barking] See? Right. That was her favorite toy. Ooh. - [ringtone plays] - My bad. [whines] Hello. - Is this Marcos Diaz? - Uh-huh. Who's this? How'd you get this number? My name is Reed Strucker. My family needs help getting across the border. You and the people you work with, - you do that, right? - Maybe. Did you hear about the mutant incident? At the high school? Those were my kids. I'm sorry, I can't... I'm a prosecutor with the city. I was involved with building a case against you and your associates for the district attorney's office. And you're calling me for help? Now, why should I lift a finger for you? Because I can help you... your, uh, your associate... Lorna Dane... goes by Polaris. What do you know about Lorna? You want to help her? You can talk to me. You know about her medical situation? What are you talking about? What medical situation? You gonna help my family? What are you talking about? I want a meeting. Yes. Fine. I'll meet you... just... tell me. She's pregnant. _ Morning. Did you get any sleep? Some. But I think you might be a mutant, too, with some sort of snoring ability. This meeting, later, with the person, you... you think it might work? Maybe. We don't have many options. I know you're doing the best you can. I'll take one option over none. Did you know it was like this? For the mutants? I knew it wasn't easy. You remember how it was. The mutants fighting each other and innocent people getting hurt, dying. People wanted something done. Well, they got what they wanted. [sighs] We got to figure out something for breakfast... What? REED: We need to go, now. What is that thing? Sentinel Services drone. It's searching the neighborhood. - It can't see us in here, can it? - It's the car, Cait. They know the car, they know the license plate. Kids. - Kids, get up. - Mom, what's-what's happening? We got to get out of here. Get your stuff. Let's go. Gonna have to move quickly. - Where are we going? - We got to stay out of sight. - With that thing in the air? - In a moment they're gonna find - the car. We have to get out of here. - Mom. Dad. The truck. Lauren, wait! Whoa. Dad. Dad, we got to go! What the hell? [indistinct conversations] ♪ Baby, do you understand me now ♪ - ♪ Sometimes I feel a little mad ♪ - [footsteps approaching] Here you go. ♪ Can always be an angel ♪ ♪ When things go wrong, I seem to be bad ♪ ♪ But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good ♪ ♪ Oh, Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood ♪ Sit. ♪ Baby... ♪ Just so we get this out of the way... if this is a setup, and cops are gonna be - coming through that door... - It's not a setup. I'm alone. No one's coming. Good. 'Cause things in here get real hot, real fast. Tell me about Lorna. She's in a detainment center. What detainment center? Until my fam... What detainment center? Where? The main detention facility in Garland. And the baby? All I know is, she's pregnant. Is it okay? Is it healthy? Please. It's my kid. All I saw was the medical exam they gave her when they brought her in. Those are all the questions I'm answering for now. Any other information is yours, but only if my family is safe. Bring everyone to this location tonight. How much is this gonna cost? I don't want your money. The deal is this: Your family goes tonight. You? You stay behind with me until I get Lorna back. ♪ Yes, I'm just a soul whose intentions ♪ ♪ Are good, oh, Lord... ♪ _ [sighs] - See? - [squeaks] [panting] All fixed. [indistinct conversations] JOHN: Don't want anyone else brought into here, so anything along the river is fine. Here. Just... do what you can, okay? Something wrong? I need to talk to you. It's about Marcos. [chuckles] Uh, listen... Marcos is, uh... he's an emotional guy. So, whatever he said, don't take it personally. No, it's not about that. It's... He got a phone call from some guy. Something about helping a family. He ran off about an hour ago. Alone. What? Why didn't you tell me? Because he told me not to, and he didn't want to get anyone else involved because it was dangerous. But then I was thinking about how I owe his girlfriend. And she'd be pissed if he died. [sighs] Come on. Well... where... where are we going? We don't even know where he is. I found you. Trust me, I can find him. ♪ ♪ [sighs] Where'd you get this car? There's, like, sticky stuff all over. Are you serious right now? What? There's, like, juice or something. What do you want me to do? I liked the truck better. LAUREN: The truck was stolen, dumb-ass. Are you brain damaged? You like the car so much, you sit on the sticky part! - Fine. - Okay, can we not do this now? Please? REED: We're here. - This everyone? - Yeah, we're all here. I want to know what happens now. We get everyone supplies... food, water, blankets... then we head down to the border. And you can drive us across? Policía America's all over the roads; You might as well go straight to jail. Now come on. We're not going anywhere until I know what's happening to my family. Look... we know people down there with... skills. They track for mutants, but we still got tricks they don't know. Mostly, we get people under the wall. Sometimes over, sometimes even through. And then, after that? We get you new names, new IDs. There are churches, - families that can help you... - [distant rustling] What? What is it? Does anyone know you're here? No, we didn't say anything. Did you tell someone you were coming? Use a computer? - The phone that you called me on? - When I called you, I used a new SIM card. There's no way... Looks like they found a way. [police radio chatter] This is the Sentinel Services. Get on the ground. Put your hands on your heads. If you try to flee or resist, we will use deadly force. - Dad, what do we do? - There's nothing we can do. There must me something... We can talk to them. Talk? Yeah, no, we're way past that. You have no idea what they have in that car. I want to speak to an attorney. That is a bad idea. We will only negotiate if one is provided. There will be no negotiation. Get your asses on the ground now! We are Americans. We have rights. You can discuss that with a judge, Mr. Strucker. Right now you need to think about what's best for your family. [loud thump] Dad? [grunts] Come on! - Go! Go, now! - Go! Go! Go! [exclaims] Damn it. Deploy the weapon, sir? - They're coming! - That way! Go! To the hallway! [electronic chittering] [grunts] - Get up! - Go! [grunts] [both yelling] What? [police radio chatter] [electronic chittering] [Lauren shrieks] Go. Go! Go! JOHN: Watch out. [grunting] [electronic whining, shrieking] Remote unit to targeting. This way. They're on the other side. - They're on the other side. - Here they come! [grunting] Clarice, you got to get us out of here. - What do you mean? - You got yourself out of the prison, you can get us out of here! No, it's different. I can't see where I'm going. - It's too dangerous. - All right, well, we will die if we stay here, so can you please just do it? LAUREN: [grunts] They're getting through! [grunting] I can't do it. - JOHN: Yes, you can! - I can't! What is that? [grunting]: Go! Hurry! JOHN: Come on! It's safe! Go! Go! Go! Andy... Andy! [yelling] Come on! - [gunshot] - [grunts] - Dad! - No! - ANDY: Dad! - LAUREN: No, please... [grunts] I can't hold it! - LAUREN: No! - CAITLIN: Get out of there! ANDY: Dad! No... - Dad! - No! No. No.
