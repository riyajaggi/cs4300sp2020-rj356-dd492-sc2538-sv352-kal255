 - What did you do? - I gave her a memory. Do you realize what you've done? FADE: We leave for the Underground tonight. - Stop the van. - What? Sentinel Services put a tracker on me. You set us up. THUNDERBIRD: A convoy of military vehicles is taking Lorna and Reed to a military airport. We need a way to stop that bus. REED: There's obviously something wrong with the bus. Is your hate for me worth more than giving

 your child a real life? If we get the chance, help me take it. It's not working. Something's interfering with my powers. Only thing I've ever known that can disrupt mutant abilities like that is... - BLINK: Is what? - THUNDERBIRD: Not what. Who. That's Pulse. Look, there's a lot of people out there. Are you sure you can fool them all? - Yeah. - Be careful. You, on the ground. [SHOUTS] POLARIS: I can feel my powers.

 There's nothing in here I can use. It's-it's all plastic. Everything metal's outside. The metal screw in my leg. Take it. [GRUNTS] [BULLETS RICOCHETING] [TIRES SCREECHING] - Come on, get in! - Come on. Go. Go! - [TIRES SCREECHING] - JACE: Damn it! I don't just want them. Shut down every safe house, every sympathizer, anyone who's ever helped them. I want 'em all. ♪ ♪ - Daddy, come back. - JACE [CHUCKLES]: No. Daddy's taking a little break, sweetie. Uh... ooh. Big, bad Dallas cop, - dizzy from a merry-go-round, huh? - You get on it. - [LAUGHS] - See how fast she was pushing that thing? I need to recharge a minute. Starting to feel a little better already, though. CROWD [IN DISTANCE]: Equality! WOMAN [IN DISTANCE]: When do we want it? CROWD: Now! PAULA: What's all that about? Uh, there's a mutant rights march happening over there. Duty sergeant asked if I wanted to do crowd control at City Hall, but... Told him I promised my girls a picnic. [SIRENS WAILING] You think something's wrong? I don't know. Seems... Seems a little bigger than they expected. Probably dealing with the overflow crowd. We should probably go, yeah? Gracie Face. OFFICER: If you do not comply, we will be forced to arrest you. PAULA: Grace, come on. Hey, Grace, we got to go, now. - Grace Elizabeth, we're leaving. - Time to go, baby. Come on. - Almost done. - JACE: Come on, baby, time to leave. Gracie Face. PAULA: Grace! Grace! JACE: We got to go, now! Grace! [SHARP RINGING] - [GASPS] - PAULA: Grace! [PAULA SCREAMING] [CRYING]: Grace! JACE: Grace! ♪ ♪ JACE: Understood. Yeah. Talk to me. What do you got? That vehicle our fugitive stole, just pulled the GPS tracker. Vehicle's headed north on 23 towards Druid Hills. All right, reroute all tactical units. Get a drone in the air. They're gonna dump that SUV as soon as they can. [PANTING] I know you didn't have to save me, too. Thank you. Thank us when we're home and safe. Right now, you need to get out of these clothes, and we need to move. - They'll be hunting for us. - I was so afraid I was never gonna see you again. Thank God you're all right. You said something about Andy and Lauren? They're all right, Reed. We're gonna see them now. ECLIPSE: These cars aren't traceable, right? THUNDERBIRD: New plates, no record. They're good. Thanks, babe. THUNDERBIRD: We got to talk. When we were out there, when we lost our powers... Yeah, what happened? What did they have? It was Pulse. He was there with Sentinel Services. - What? - That's impossible. He died. Marcos, I saw him. He's alive. No, he hated Sentinel Services. He protected all his people in Macon. They raided that station. No. No, he'd never work for them. God, if they can turn Pulse, then they can... Sentinel Services drone coming in. We got to move, now. It'll see us soon. I'll draw it off, try to take it down. - Okay, I'm coming. - You just got out of prison, Lorna. You go, I go. We'll meet you at headquarters. Go. You see it? It's behind us. Looks like we got a new friend. We're gonna have a lot more friends if we don't take it down soon. Okay, uh... [GRUNTING] It's out of range. I can't reach. Where is it? I don't, I don't see it. Uh... it's above us. POLARIS: Care to do the honors? Okay. Come on. [EXPLOSION] Yes. [PANTING, BOTH LAUGH] God, I love you. Come here. Drone just went down. Lock in their last location. I want units at every intersection within a ten-mile radius. I want our transport right here. If they're smart, they're gonna take these side roads, head for the interstate. We'll cut 'em off before they escape. They're really starting to piss me off. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Shatter! Hey. What are all these people doing here? What's going on? More like what isn't going on. You need to talk to Sage. [TRADER SCREAMS IN DISTANCE] What is this place? A Mutant Underground way station. It's the headquarters for the area. We're in the room downstairs. What about our plans to get out of the country? To go to Mexico? We weren't going anywhere without you. Reed. Andy? Lauren? Dad. - LAUREN: Dad. - Hey. Hey. Hey. [SNIFFLING] REED: You okay? We were so worried. We thought you... [MAN SCREAMING, GRUNTING] How long has it been like this? A while. Soon as you hit that convoy, Sentinel Services hit back. - How hard? - Raided every place there were even suspected mutant sympathizers. With no warrants. They are out for blood. We got our hands full. And we can't move anyone, not with this kind of heat. I'm manning the scanners, trying to keep our people off the grid. We need to keep listening. If anything comes up on the radio, we have to know about it. LAUREN: It's not just the thing with Dad. Sentinel Services shot Harry. ANDY: These people are in bad shape. I mean, they're doing everything they can. Hey! What the hell? - What do you think you're doing here? - Let's talk about this. FADE: We ain't got nothing to talk about! What's going on? Stop it! - [PUNCHING] - Dad! - LAUREN: No, Dad... - You nearly got me killed. Let go! - Reed! - Dad! [GRUNTS] That's enough! What are you doing? How about protecting us? Just so y'all know, last time I saw this son of a bitch, he was working for Sentinel Services. [CROWD MURMURING] [DISPATCHER SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] All right, I want three more units in this position. Based on the drone's last location, we know they're near here. What's the status of the other roadblocks? Every route in a 20-mile perimeter is secured. Reinforcements are coming. Whatever we got, double it. Don't want to take any chances. Hey, babe. Everything okay? PAULA: You tell me. It sounds like you're still out there. I-I thought the transfer was gonna be done by noon. Yeah, we, uh, we had an issue. I can't really talk about it, but we got some cleanup to do. All right. Come home soon. I promise. When the job is done. When the job's done. I love you. - Be safe. - Always. Love you, too. - Everyone, just calm down. - Calm down? This dude's job was locking up people like us. LAUREN: Just listen. My dad prosecuted mutants, okay? He did. When he found out about us, he stood up to Sentinel Services. Yeah. By wearing a tracker into my bar. Hey, back off my dad. REED: Andy. I was doing what I had to do to get back to my family. - I realized I was wrong... - FADE: "And I'm sorry." - That-That's it, right? - All right. Hey, just hear him out! [TRADER SCREAMING IN DISTANCE] Okay, stop. There are injured people here. Why are we attacking each other? You go. You help them. Take Andy and Lauren with you. I... I'll work this out. - But he's saying that... - [TRADER CONTINUES SCREAMING] BLINK: Caitlin, I need you in here now. What he's saying is true. What? [TRADER GROANING] You go. I can handle this. Let's work this out. [GROANING] - What happened? - He was shot. I don't know, it won't stop bleeding. Hi. It's Harry, right? Harry, I need you to listen to me. I'm gonna take a look at your wound. - It hurts... - I know. I need you to be strong for me. I need clean gauze. Towels will work, too. And painkillers. Dilaudid, fentanyl, even codeine, anything you can find. Okay. We're drawing a lot of attention. LAUREN: Just ignore them. ANDY: Did you see the way they were looking at us? - I think we should just get Dad and go. - Go where? I don't know, someplace where invisible guys don't attack us. Andy, we need to get them to trust us. Kids, I need some help over here. Help with him? Yes, Andy, with him. Come on. Let's put that Scout first aid badge to work. [TRADER GASPING] Come on, just keep your eyes open, okay? SHATTER: Hey, there you are. Listen, some of us been talking. About that lawyer who just came in. What about him? Might need you to do your thing. Now, if folks decide that he's not welcome, you're gonna have to make him forget this place - and everyone in it. - Yeah. I mean, if-if that's what it comes to. If Johnny says it's okay. Well, it might be that we need to do it even if he doesn't. Hmm. What was he, uh, talking about? Was he asking you to, what, erase memories? Uh, I manipulate people's memories. Sometimes we just use it for security purposes. Really? - I just thought you were able... - You know, we should really get back. FADE: How can we even think about trusting him after what he did? REED: My own children are mutants. Do you really think I'd betray the one place - that's protecting them? - You tell me. - You already tried once. - I am simply asking you to... - No! You can't ask me a damn thing. - Let him talk. We're never gonna get anywhere if you don't... John. - I need you to come with me now. - What is it? You said to come find you if anything's up on the police scanners, and something weird's going on. All right. SAGE: Until a few minutes ago, the radios were going wild with activity. Manhunts, the works. And then the chatter just stopped. POLICEMAN: We're gonna pull over the large gray sedan... What, is that a traffic stop they're calling in? Yeah, a-and a minute ago, it was a drunk and disorderly over by the freeway. THUNDERBIRD: And there's nothing on the manhunt? There's a possibility they've abandoned the search... They didn't abandon anything. Yeah. We're handling this, all right? Let me help you. I used to work these kind of manhunts. I know the protocols. You want to protect this place, I could be good for that. DISPATCHER: Copy that. Be advised, 488 at 17... 488 is petty theft. Sending all units for a petty theft? No way. You have a map? Right there. REED: The last three calls to come in before this one was a burglary in Stratford, lewd conduct at a bar in Hapeville, and a 586 in Glen Haven. They sent multiple units to all of these places. Which means that they know we're listening. So now they're speaking in code. Sentinel Services is searching here... for Eclipse and Polaris. And they've got Atlanta PD here. They're tightening a net, working a grid. Looking for us. Okay, I think we're clear. - You all right? - I'm not wearing cuffs or prison overalls. I'd say that's a start. Hey. When, uh... When you were away, I, uh... I heard from the prosecutor and... I heard... About the baby. I know... I know you've been through a lot. [EXHALES] I just want to know. Is it all right? Yeah, I think. I, uh... I can feel it. Almost the way I can feel metal or electricity. It's in there, inside me. My baby. [LAUGHS SOFTLY] Our baby. I haven't even said those words aloud until just now. Yeah. Are you, uh... You happy? Look, when I was gone, I thought a lot. About the world I was bringing a baby like ours into. You know what I thought about when you were gone? [LAUGHS SOFTLY] How I couldn't wait to meet this kid. How I couldn't wait to be a father. POLARIS: Marcos. We're gonna have a weird kid. [BOTH LAUGH] If it's a girl, we should call her Aurora. Aurora? And what if it's a... it's a boy, what? Rory? Rory? Rory... - We're not naming our son Rory. - Come on, what? It's just a thought. I mean, it's the boy version of Aurora. Right? - I love you. - I love you. Weeks. - Where are my other units? - ETA ten minutes. I made a request for this position 20 minutes ago. Deputy director rerouted some units - to expand the search toward... - Why? This is the objective, right here. I want bodies, I want 'em now. [SIGHS] Marcos. We got to find another route. No. Keep going. - What? - Keep going. - What are you talking about? - Go! Lorna, what are you doing? - Lorna. - [ENGINE REVS] Lorna! Weapons up! Lorna, stop! Stop the car now! [TIRES SCREECHING] Out of the car with your hands up! [SCREAMS] JACE: Stand down, or I will open fire. [SHOUTS] Uh, babe, we have to go. POLARIS: Oh, we're going. But this one's coming with us. JACE: If you want to shoot me, shoot me. Just get this over with. [GRUNTS] POLARIS: You wish. [GRUNTING] Lorna. Lorna. Lorna. Lorna. What? He likes putting collars on people so much, - I thought I'd give him one of his own. - Hey. We just kidnapped a Sentinel Services agent. Do you have any idea what this means? I'll tell you exactly what it means. This is our chance to find out what happened to Pulse. If they're turning us against each other, we're done. The network, all of it is over. - We have to figure out what's going on. - Yeah, but look, they will be searching for him. Yeah, because they know how valuable he is. Marcos, Pulse was John's best friend. Look, if they can get him, they can get anyone. Look at me. They were gonna try to turn me. Think about that. What it would've meant. Okay? We have to do this. [QUIETLY]: Yeah. Are there more I.V. bags? You mean, those water things, or the yellow pee-looking ones? Could you be any more gross? You really want to ask me that? [GROANS] Um, I think we're out of both. ANDY: Is he gonna be okay? I'm not even sure more saline would help. We need actual blood. Okay, here. Hey, I'm O negative. It's universal donor, right? Andy. What, are you surprised I actually remember something - from biology? - No. I am. I can do it. [SIGHS] Okay. Come here, put your sleeve up. There, I'll do that. Okay. Okay. Lauren, hold this. Thanks. Okay? Okay. - You ready? - Yeah. Just take a deep breath. Stand there, don't move your arm. And gravity will do the rest. If the cops really are coming here, we could try and leave, but... Uh, based on average police response times, any identifiable mutants leaving here will be apprehended before we're out of city limits. REED: They're looking for fugitives. The only thing that's gonna stop them is if they find one. What are you saying? I have to go out there. Get seen. Steer 'em away from this place. Make it look like we went in another direction. Even if they see you, it doesn't mean they'll stop searching. I know how these things work. They made an educated guess about the direction we went. If they were to see me anywhere here, they would assume I was going to 85 South, toward Alabama, and they would redirect the search that way. And if you get caught, they'll question you. And you know our location. THUNDERBIRD: Maybe we can avoid that. In that convoy today, one of your guards was a mutant. What was Pulse doing with you? What'd it look like he was doing? He was working with us. Not all mutants are terrorists. POLARIS: So what you're saying is, after you shot him, he was so overwhelmed with gratitude that he decided to turn on all of his friends? What, he took up genocide as a hobby? Genocide? Wow, is that... is that what you think this is about? Is that what you tell yourself? What else is it about? How about July 15? Hey, now, that was the actions of a few people. Not all mutants, whatever your politicians say. A lot of people died on both sides. Yeah, they did. And you know what? Nobody had to die. I'm not going to sit here and apologize for trying to stop violence... ECLIPSE: What, with more violence? You know, 7/15 started as a peaceful protest! Well, your peaceful protest killed my little girl. She was seven, man. Barely even knew what a mutant was. Marcos, come here. [ECLIPSE SIGHS] Look, I, uh, I feel for him. - Okay? I really do. - Yeah. But we've got to remember all the people we have lost since 7/15. Okay, the world changed for everyone that day, but us most of all. Thousands dead. Mutants being hunted all across the country... I don't need a history lesson. Are you sure? Look, we're fighting for our lives here. We're fighting for every mutant that could be turned into a weapon against us. Look at him. You think he's going to give us any information now? Well, if he's not going to give it to us... we're gonna have to take it. [PHONE RINGING] DREAMER [OVER PHONE]: Are you all right? Everyone's worried you're not back. I know, something came up. - Look, we kidnapped a Sentinel Services agent. - What? What are you talking about? Listen, I'll explain later. I know it's dangerous. But you need to get here now. I'm asking you to help save the whole station. He's going to lure the cops, point 'em in the wrong direction. You just get him back here safely. I know you're not happy with me, but I've taken full responsibility for what I did. Is this a joke? You want me to go out there and save this guy's ass? One of our people just took a bullet in the gut saving this man. We need his help. You're gonna do this. Whatever you say, boss. You talk to your family if you need to. You're leaving in five. CAITLIN: No. Reed, you-you can't do this. We just got you back. - The police are coming. - [SIGHS] We can't evacuate, and even if we did, there is nowhere to go. It has to be you? I mean, we're in a building filled with people with powers... They didn't just escape from jail. They're looking for me. These people... they need to know which side I'm on. And if this is my chance to make things right, I have to take it. What will I tell the kids? Tell them I'll be back by dinner. You better. [LAUREN SIGHS] - Are you okay? - [GASPING] - You need to hold still! - What's wrong with him? - What's he doing? - We're running out of time. We're gonna have to remove the bullet, okay? [GASPING] Hey. You know this is only gonna get worse, right? Oh, yeah? For us or for you? You're in enough trouble as it is. You really want to add kidnapping me to your list of charges? Your only move is to let me go and hope for the best. I'll make you a deal, Agent Turner. You want us to let you go? Tell us the truth. Tell us about our friend Pulse. Tell us about those secret detention facilities - you love so much. - They're only kept secret to protect them from people like you, Ms. Dane. They keep dangerous people off the streets. People? You mean mutants. And last time I checked, Pulse wasn't off the streets, he was guarding your prison convoy. Look, if you're hoping that I'm gonna fill you in on employee personnel files, prepare to be disappointed. Look, uh, we're going to find out what we want to know, one way or another. So you're talking torture now? POLARIS: No. That's more your department, remember? - Yeah, you... - [CRACKLING] Hey. We got here as quickly as we could. We've got something else in mind. ECLIPSE: Why didn't you guys use the door? We're trying to keep a low profile here. Pretty sure that ship has sailed. [VEHICLES APPROACHING] [TIRES SCREECHING] [INDISTINCT RADIO TRANSMISSION] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] WOMAN: Clear the southwest sector. [INDISTINCT RADIO TRANSMISSION] OFFICER [OVER BULLHORN]: This is Sentinel Services. We know you have the hostage. Come out now! Traffic cameras are hooked into the district police station. Once I'm spotted, it'll send the cops in the wrong direction, away from the Mutant Underground. I'll meet you two blocks up, on Elm. Right? You got it, Counselor. [TIRES SQUEALING] MAN: What's the matter with that guy? ♪ ♪ DISPATCH: Fugitive suspect identified on the corner of Waverly and Green, near the 85 on-ramp. Say again: Waverly and Green. All units converge immediately. That's the call. They're on him. OFFICER: Unit 3223 en route. It's working. They're redirecting their search south. We're in the clear. But he's not. Text his burner. Tell him to get out of there. [PHONE BUZZES] ANDY: Can you take the bullet out? CAITLIN: I don't know. I-I-I'm not a surgeon. But we can't wait any longer. I'm just gonna have to take the chance. So, do I just stay hooked up to him or...? If you can. The bullet's lodged too deep. I'm going to have to make a midline incision. Lauren, just keep pressure on that entry wound. Ready? [LAUREN GROANS] Okay. Okay, there it is. Okay. Okay. Got it. ANDY: Badass. CAITLIN: Okay. [GASPING] [GASPING] LAUREN: Mom? Mom, what's happening? He's hemorrhaging. An artery must have... It's not stopping! It's... I can't stop the blood. Not without a cross-clamp. - LAUREN: Where's the artery? - What? - Show me. - Lauren, I... - I-I-I don't know... - Mom, show me! What? There. The bleeding's coming from that artery right there. Okay, stand back. I'm gonna try to get pressure on it. I think... I think I got it. [GASPS] - Can you sew him up? - Okay. Yeah. Okay, okay. Here. Okay. Just hurry! - Okay. - Hold it. One more. Okay. There, let me tighten... okay, there. - Oh. - [EXHALES] Okay. [GASPING QUIETS] - Is he gonna be okay? - CAITLIN: I think so. I think he'll be all right. We did it. So cool. [SIGHS] Dad's not going to believe this. OFFICER: I'm two blocks away. ETA 45 seconds. The police are getting closer. It should be okay. Fade's supposed to pick him up at the next intersection. [SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE] No, no, no, come on. Where are you? [SIREN APPROACHING] OFFICER 2: Suspect spotted, heading towards the corner of Elm. SAGE: They're right on top of him. [SIREN WAILING] [TIRES SCREECHING] Freeze! Police! [LOUD BANG] [GUNSHOTS] What the hell was that?! Just making sure whose side you're really on. Suspect is fleeing. I repeat, suspect is fleeing. Secure the area! Do a sweep. What's the word? All we know is Agent Turner's inside with hostiles. No word how many or what they want. You tried making contact? They're not talking to us. Then we're going in for a face-to-face. Prep your team for a breach. Yes, sir. Prepare to breach, all units. It looks like they're getting ready to move in. Can you get us out of here if things escalate? - Maybe. - Maybe? Dude, FYI, it's a bit more taxing tearing holes into space than it is turning your hands - into flashlights. - Point taken. POLARIS: He knows what they did to Pulse. He doesn't want to share. Okay, I'll see what I can find out. I'm warning you, whatever you're planning on doing, this is assault on a federal officer. Hmm. Don't worry, handsome. You won't feel a thing. OFFICER: Come on, guys, stay close. COMMANDER: Move in. ECLIPSE: Oh, hey. Hey, they're moving. Now, we are running out of time. Then I'll buy us some more. [METAL CLANKING, CREAKING] WEEKS: Everybody down! We have to do something here. COMMANDER: Sir, we can't go in. It's too dangerous. Then we make them come out. JACE: Out of the car with your hands up! - [JACE GRUNTING] - ECLIPSE: Lorna! [GASPS] WEEKS: Get ready, everyone. Weapons ready. Firing. Watch out! Tear gas! [ALL COUGHING] - Marcos. - You okay? POLARIS: Yeah, yeah, I'm good. BLINK: Is she done? POLARIS: Sonya, Sonya! Come on. [BOTH COUGHING] [SCREAMS] [GRUNTING] Move in, now! Go, go, go! Hurry! This way! Sonya! No, come on! It's too late! Come on! Come on! Wait! Lorna! I can't leave him like this! [JACE SCREAMING] [GRUNTS] [GIGGLES] [SCREAMING] - What do you think? - About what? Well, Agent Turner definitely knew Pulse. It's hazy, but there was a building and some documents and, uh, a logo. I-I did my best. You know what this is? I don't recognize that. I do. This was on our friend's arm. It was like a tattoo or a brand. You know that place? That's the Federal Building in Baton Rouge. Some people I prosecuted were transferred there. - What happened to 'em? - I don't know. They disappeared. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] Do you want some dinner? Yeah. Yeah, I do. Ugh. Madam. [LAUGHS] All this looks great. Mmm. Yeah. If you told me three weeks ago I would be this happy to eat a rib-shaped barbecue pork patty, I would have said you were insane. [LAUGHTER] You know what? It's not bad. Mm. It's terrible. [ALL CHUCKLING] This is the best terrible meal I have ever had. ANDY: So, what now? Are-are we going to Mexico or whatever? I mean, I thought that was the plan. Was to leave the country. I heard Cancún's pretty cool. CAITLIN: Well, I don't think we have to worry about any of it just yet. It's still not safe to travel. REED: It's not just that. I've been talking to some of the people here, and they have questions about the Sentinel Services and what they're doing, and... I can help them with that. LAUREN: So, we're just... here. Right now, yeah. But you guys and your mom... you saved lives today. They can use us here. The most important thing is we are all together. Right? [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] CAITLIN: Mmm-mmm. Hey. I need to talk to you. Did you mess with my head? What do you mean? I was watching you with the Sentinel Services guy. And then I remembered something. Last week, the two of us started to have a conversation, and now that conversation's just gone. And now I can't go ten minutes without this memory of John coming back to me. I'm asking you straight up, did you mess with my head? You couldn't use your abilities. Johnny was in trouble, and if you were gonna help, you-you needed a connection to him. You had no right. Were you ever gonna tell me? Look, I know that you're angry, but you have to understand, people's lives were at stake. I don't have to understand anything. What you do is wrong. You decided that you needed to fix me, and now I get to live with the memory of loving someone I barely know. Someone who doesn't love me. I can take it away if you want. I can remove the memory... Just stay away from me. [VEHICLE APPROACHES] - [PAULA SIGHS] - Hey. - [VEHICLE DEPARTS] - Come here. Oh, God. I was so worried. I wanted to come and see you, but they wouldn't let me. I know, I know. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. They had to debrief me and check me out and all that. Just kind of took a while. Are you... are you all right? - Yeah. - They said that... No, I'm fine. Yeah, I'm-I'm... a little scrambled, but I'm-I'm good. I'm good. All right? Grace wait up for me? Come on, I know it's late. I just want to tuck her in, read her a little Frog and Toad. Jace... you want to talk to our daughter? Why are you looking at me like that? Oh, God. Oh, God. What did they do to you? Baby. You're freaking me out. What's going on? Where's Grace? Grace is gone. What do you mean? We lost her. We lost our baby. Why would you say that? We lost our little girl. That's... Grace is dead! She died four years ago. What did they do to me? I don't... That's not possible. - She's gone, Jace! - Baby... Don't say that. That we lost her. No. No. She... she's gone. [CRYING] [SOBBING]: Oh, my...
