 And she's down. How are we going? Good. - Do you need a hand? - No! These are mine. I'm taking them back. Audrey stole them. What?! Well, darling, there's no room for them here. - You can barely swing a cat. - Can you stop saying that? Who swings cats? - Anyway, he was unemployed. - Not anymore. So we couldn't get a renovated two-storey terrace, could we? Not even with the embellished income I wrote on the form.

 It's very competitive, Mum. - This is all we need. - Yep, this is perfect. Though a king bed would be good. En suite, double sink. The fridge with the ice maker, they're fun. Serviced apartment living ruined you. Hey, we should have a housewarming dinner party! Who'd we have? Like, Em and Pete, and Martha and Anoush, and Barb and Neale, and Ester and Ruben. A fun Mum dinner? Do you reckon there's space? Well, how many could we fit in here? One. - When are you going? - When my Airbnbs have checked out. At least two. Plus us, that's four.

 Well, that'll do. Pete and Em, then. - Am I not invited? - No. God, I can't wait to make something that doesn't involve pureeing. What was I good at again? - Tuna mornay! - I'm glad I'm not coming. Not now, before we had Stevie. And don't tell people I made that. It's gross, but delicious. Where are my Ottolenghis? Oh, you don't want to just ease into it? Maybe start with a 10-minute Jamie? What?! Both of them! - They're mine! - They're mine! - I bought them. - For me. As a gift. - OK, time out. - It is mine. - They're both mine. - Time out. This is all mine. There is cash in there. Oh, for goodness sake. Watch her, she's stealing. - Well, this is actually mine. - OK. ♪ Anything can happen when you're just like me ♪ ♪ I'm running carelessly through a maze ♪ ♪ How unexpected ♪ ♪ I'm under lock and key... ♪ It's gonna take three coats, I reckon. Tidy cutting in. - Did you check the lease? - Yes. Did you really? No, but I'm improving the property. Don't know why we don't just leave it. Stevie might like it. Yuck. Well, I do not. And I'll be spending a lot of time in here. I think that's what they call 'pink shaming'. And that is where people shame girls for liking traditional feminine things. Daddy read an article. - Did you? - Mm. Hey, can you go and put the cot up in our room? - Why? - Because this paint was on special. I'm guessing it's toxic. No, it's not. I'm kidding. - But just in case. - I'll move the cot. OK, thank you. Yeah, it's great. Reminds me of the Redfern place, when we first met at uni. - Just need some goon and Cheezels. - (STEVIE CRIES) And not that noise. Well, it's better than the crap you listened to at uni. But I will make it stop. This has to simmer for two hours anyway. Ooh, can I come? I need to see her. I think she's finally come 'round to me. Did you not put the bin out? I can still smell that nappy. - You can't smell it! - Take it out! Can you smell it? Yes, it stinks. - Want a beer? - Yeah. Mugged? Holy shit! - Were you hurt? - Shhh. Yeah, a little. - I thought you came back for Aud. - Yeah, I did! I mean, I didn't come back because I was mugged. No. But don't tell her about the mugging. She needs to be near Verity. (WHISPERS) Is it cancer? What, Verity? No, she's fine! But, I mean, there was a bunch of factors. I mean, I didn't want to work the 14-hour day anymore, and Stevie's getting older. So is Audrey. And, you know, Harry's been harassing me to consult remotely. But I really like the new job. And Adelaide is more dangerous than I thought. I still can't take the bin out at night. Jesus. Did you fight back? Totally get why women carry their keys. - Teenagers, mate. - Yes! Teenage boys are scary. - Nobs. - And angry. Yeah, these were girls. These were actually girls. But then these girls were really tough. Yeah. Yeah, girls can be scary, I know that. - Well, it's good to see you. - Yeah. - Do you want to take the rubbish out? - Nah. Will you come with me while I do it? Sorry, guys. A little bit out of practice. - Oh, beautiful. Yum. - That's alright. Anyway, it's nice not to be eating at 5:30, and at... 10:00! - Is it? - Yeah. A bit after. Well, yes. Very European. Anyway, here's cheers to our new place, and to you guys moving in together. - Yay! - Cheers. Cheers. You guys do everything we do, just a couple of years later. Which means... What? What comes next? - Oh, kids? - Mm! No, nope. We discussed and decided we're not having them. No, don't want them. - Yeah, you do. Everyone does. - Yeah, you do. You have to. They're gr... Well, Stevie's an excellent one. I mean she's thoughtful, funny. Yeah, she's smashing her milestones. And she's sleeping through now, sometimes. And that rash will clear up any day now. That's temporary. No. It's got nothing to do with Stevie, or the... that rash. I just, um, I just don't want to do it. Yeah, we want to travel, live overseas. And we're focussing on our careers right now. - So are we. - You just quit a six-figure job! And promptly got a five-figure one, which is great. - Thanks. - Yeah, you just take turns. Yeah, except the woman's turn usually involves primary caring and working full-time, - sacrificing a social life, sanity... - I'm sane. ...and everything else. And that's why I'm back here, so we can share the load. Right? Yeah, and so I can have my turn. 'Cause you can still have kids and a great career. Yeah, you can. Sure. But I don't want that. Well, you might, so just don't rule it out. We've ruled. Mm. We've ruled. Hey, why are you getting worked up about this? I thought you were pro-choice. I mean, surely that includes no kids? Sorry. Yes, we are. Sorry. Yes, yes. Cheers. To no kids. ALL: No kids! No kids. Oh, you got food. You got... You've got food. So what's next for you, Aud? Well, right now, dessert! - Oh, yummy! - Well, I hope so. I'm going to make ice-cream from scratch. From scratch? (PHONE DINGS) Oh... Sorry. (EVA SCREAMS) Shhhh. Shhh. Oh, sh... That one's OK, isn't it? She's going to cry at customs anyway. It's a 23-hour flight. - Uno. - Uno. Oh! - Didn't say it fast enough. - Yes, I did. - Pick up. - It's a stupid rule. - You're a stupid rule. - Your face is a stupid rule. - (CRIES) - Yeah, exactly. Oh, God! Have you got her? Hey! Nah, she's alright. Does she have this? Do you have this? (CRIES) Do I have this now? - OK, then. - Hey, Audrey! Oh, hi. - I was just gonna meet, um... - Do you want to join us? - Uh, I'm too old, aren't I? - Come on. They're really nice and we're having a party. We're doing a Zhua Zhou kind of thing. - A what what? - I'll show you. It's really fun. Guys, this is Audrey and Stevie. - ALL: Hi. - Hi. So it's supposed to help predict their future. - Oh, did you hear that? - Watch Van. You go. (SPEAKS CHINESE) Ready? Here we go. Oh! Yeah! You want a go, Aud? Can I? I have no idea what my vocation is. This is brilliant. - Look at this. - What do you do, Audrey? - She's a stay-at-home mum. - No, no. I'm working again. I'm a copywriter for the council. What about you guys? PhD in international relations. Med student. Masters, biochem. I thought I told you. Jeez, that's impressive. With babies! Campus creche, it's practically free. It's the only reason why I came back. OK, bubs. Let's have a go. What are you going to pick? What's this thing? - ALL: Oh! - (LAUGHS) Oh! What's that? Is that chef or...? That's pretty good. I can live with that. No, it's homemaker. Domestic. - It means she'll be a good... - BOTH: Housewife. The garlic is chef. Well, surely the spoon is cooking. And that's the... Pick again, darling. She was going for something else, but then she got distracted. - So, redraw! - You're not really meant to go... It's OK, just let her pick again. Oh, shit. I mean, she... she does love wood. So I mean that could be a wooden thing, like a furniture maker, or an architect? - No, that architect's the Lego block. - Is it? - Yeah. - OK, well, um... Third time lucky, hey? (LAUGHS) Here we go. Here we go. Just shuffle these around a bit. 'Cause that was right near her. So I'll just... shuffle and... Fuck! Sorry. - Sorry, sorry. - It's just a game, Aud. Well, it's OK for you, you got a doctor, didn't you? I'm just going to put it away. She's going for something else! What's she got here? It's a... a scholar! You got the... the writer. Well done, darling! That makes more sense. - (LAUGHS) - Yes, something more academic. You're going to be a professor. Or a famous writer, novelist. Yeah, go for it! That's what we said. - You would finish your Masters. - You reckon? The millennials make it look so easy. No self-doubt. It would mean a couple of years of little-to-no income. That's alright. Maybe I could keep doing the newsletters? Because people really seem to love them. Or no. I mean, we can live cheaply. - We just have to do up a... - Don't say a budget. - (GROANS) - I've done it now. I want to eat out. Like, a lot. Yeah, alright. At those restaurants where you pay what you can. I think you should do it. Apparently campus childcare is really cheap. - It's my turn. - Yeah. It's your turn, you know. You're an incredible mother, an incredible partner and you deserve it. I actually meant putting her down, because you've done it every night this month. - Yeah. - But thanks for the speech. Yeah, I actually feel quite empowered after my time alone, like I can do it all. - Now, can you start dinner? - You bet. - And unpack the dishwasher. - OK. - Oh, and it's bin night. - Is it? I was mugged in Adelaide. What? I was mugged in Adelaide. What?! OK. Can you put the bins out? OK, so it looks like you abandoned your Masters six years ago? 'Abandon's a strong word. I needed the money. Got used to that. And then I fell pregnant. Oh, great. Well, no judgement there. And, obviously as a mature-age student, you will need to get your thesis approved again as a mature age. That's fine. And do you know what you want to do? It says here that you started researching Female Representation in the Media. Yeah. OK, well, it's a bit tired. Maybe the discourse on the #MeToo movement could, you know, freshen it up a little bit. Or, you know, maybe finding some new angle... Well, since having a kid I have a very different perspective on the female experience. So 'Representations of Motherhood', maybe? Yeah, you'll probably need to move away from these well-trodden ideas. Mature-age students often do change their thesis topic, so it'll be fine. You guys are an indecisive bunch. Well, that's probably because we're out there living life in all its complexity. You know, not living on campus like big babies, just going from uni bar to lecture to uni bar. Yeah, I just mean that there's a lot on that now, 'Representations of Motherhood', and you just might need to find a new and distinct point of view. Mine. My point of view could be distinct. Yeah, yeah, except that, like, every mother thinks that their experience is unique. Maybe you could try a comparative study, looking into representations in childhood and how they play into your experience of motherhood now, decades later. And being mature age, I'm sure you can draw on a wealth of wisdom. OK. Can you maybe stop saying 'mature age'? Because I'm not even 40. Well, technically, anyone over the age of 21 is a mature-age student. - Oh, are they? - Mm-hm. Are you over 21? Yep. Anyway, one of my master students is doing incredible research into intersectionality and transgressing gender normativity and labels, et cetera. It's really, really exciting. So maybe you could have a rethink and circle back to me when you've got something a little bit more relevant. Intersectionality and motherhood. OK, yeah, but just not copying. You don't have to answer now. Just sit on it. Maybe not for six years. (CHUCKLES) (CHUCKLES AWKWARDLY) Thank... thank you. Thanks. - I've just got an appointment. Um... - Uh, yep. Yep. AMBROSE: Well, I can't really compare the measurements. You should have just waited for your two-year check-up. Sorry. I was just a bit busy with... everything. And how's she sleeping now? Better? Yeah, she started sleeping through when Jeremy got back. So that's, what, three months ago? So annoying. Oh, it's good. It's great. I feel like I've had an 18-month hangover that's suddenly gone. And I read something about them picking up on your stress, so maybe... Well, some babies sleep through the night from day one, others take 18 months, some five years. And some pick up on stress. Everyone's different. Let's go through the list. Any concerns re drug or alcohol use? No. Experienced any violence or aggression in the home? Only Stevie, with the head bonking. - Oh. - But I am using an assertive 'no'. Good. Any family strain, or problems in your relationship? Not anymore. Any questions around contraception? - Or conception if you're thinking...? - No. OK. Mental health. Any depression or anxiety? Feelings of low self-worth, that type of thing? Uh... oh, sort of. Nothing major. But, um, I had a termination nine months ago. OK, right. Uh, that's a lot to go through. Was it too soon or...? Yeah, there were some medical complications with my uterus... ...but, um... mm, too soon, for a few reasons. And is that why it's taken you so long to reschedule our catch-up? Maybe. (CHUCKLES) Audrey, have you, um, have you had any support? Have you told anyone? Yeah, well, just Mum. Jeremy, obviously. But no-one else, which is a bit crazy, because I'm very pro-choice, you know, political, feminist. But I don't know, I'm... A mother. And mothers don't do that. Except, of course, they do. And for a multitude of reasons. Look, I'm sure that making that decision was really hard... ...but it was your decision. Yeah, I think it was the right one. I'm feeling a lot better. Do you think you need to speak to anyone? Because I can recommend... - No, I'm good. - Alright. Oh, don't write it down. One-year check-up done. Off you go. I'll see you in a couple of months, for your two-year check-up. Yep. (WOMEN CHATTER) This is excellent. So it's dark. No-one can see your moves? Yeah, pretty much. I try out sick new moves every week. Hey, you know it's a dancing thing, yeah? It's not, um... I don't know. What's with the stiff denim? There is no other casual. Hi, everyone! Hi. I'm sorry I'm late. Look at you! - I couldn't get out of the car. - (LAUGHS) I wasn't even sure that you would make it. When are you due? Technically the 31st, but my Caesar's booked in for three weeks from today. Oh, wow. - Good decision. - Yeah, thanks. Oh, but guess what? No leaking! I highly recommend the iControl and regular physio and acupuncture and low-level Pilates, if anyone's having any problems. Oh, but how exciting is this? I feel like I haven't seen any of you in ages. What have you all been up to? Just work, you know. Nothing... Oh, no! We booked our tickets for Italy. We are going for four glorious weeks! Oh, wow. Lucky you! I spent the week wiping bottoms. - Gastro. - Yuck! Yuck! Again! I might have stayed in bed till midday with my new flatmate. Oh, how romantic! I had an abortion. Oh, shit, love. Do you think you should be dancing tonight? Oh, no, no, not today. No, sorry that wasn't supposed to come out like that. I just wanted to tell you. You know, I've been meaning to tell you for ages. - How long ago? - Ah, nine months. The pregnancy wasn't planned and there were some medical risks, so... Hey, you don't need to explain. You had one. I had one years ago. Wow. OK. I mean, not for me, but you know, whatever. Why didn't you say something, you big dag? Hey, why didn't you tell me? I mean, I told you all that stuff. I know. I don't know. Maybe I was a bit worried about how you'd react or... a bit embarrassed. I'm sorry. Oh, don't... don't cry! You'll make me cry. Oh, you don't have to be sorry about anything, Aud. Maybe I still have some trauma from the birth or something, but I don't think I could have coped. I mean, you'll cope. You're a coper. Are you guys coming in? You're kind of loitering. Sorry! OK, ladies, are we good to go? Yeah? Are we good? - Yeah. - Let's go, yeah? We can cry inside. - It's dark. - Yeah. And dance. We can cry-dance. - Crance! - Yes, we can crance. - How much is it? - Have you got money? It's five bucks. Arrow, do I get any money off because I brought people? No. (DANCE MUSIC PLAYS) ♪ I'm losing it... ♪ Oh... Oh, God. Sophie? Sophie, is that you? (CRIES) - Sophie? - Audrey. Call the OB. My OB. Yep, yep. I'll call someone. Martha! Barb! Where's the epidural! I need drugs. Now! It's a drug-free event, mate, but I think that guy might be selling... - Holy shit! - Drug me! Soph, you may think you want the ecstasy but you don't. You've got ages. We'll get you some legal pain relief as soon as we... Arggh! OK, just relax. Release. - Just releasing... - Nothing's releasing. Argh! Nothing's releasing! I'm going to die! Oh, my God. That's good. You're meant to feel like that. It's been fucking ages! Call Ziggy. Oh, alright, she's nude-ing up. That means the baby's close. Someone call an ambulance! We need hot water, scissors, towels. Go! It's not Gone With The Wind, love. We don't have time. She's transitioning. - (GROANS) - OK. She's mooing. OK, Soph, now, let's push into your bottom. - Push into your bottom. - No, don't push. Release. Think of the cervix like a tulip. - It's opening, it's softening. - I don't want to release. - I want to push! - Well, then, push! No, it's release! What if she prolapses? Argh! Fuck you! Fuck all of you! - Especially you, Audrey. - OK. Argh! - The head! - ALL: Oh! Someone take her undies off. Move aside. Martha, you know about that. What? No. Different skill set. I'll do it. I'll do it. I'll do it. They're down, they're down, they're down! I've got you, I've got you, I've got you. - Did you call an ambulance? - No, did you? No, you said you would! No, I said, "Someone call an ambulance," to someone. - Didn't you study medicine? - I didn't finish! - Can't handle blood. - Blood? Is there blood?! - It's OK, it's OK. - Oh, shit, I don't know if I can... The head's there. I can see the head. That's it, Soph. You're doing it. Holy shit, she's doing it! - That's it, it's coming! - Oh, my God! - Oh, my God. - You've done it! You've done it! You've done it! (BABY CRIES) Oh, my God. OK, I got you. I got you. OK. OK. ♪ I need plans in my life ♪ ♪ I was trying to get there ♪ ♪ Now I'm going nowhere... ♪ She's perfect. Can I have my baby, please? Can I hold her, please? ♪ Tears are falling on the inside ♪ ♪ Hear the magic memory... ♪ (GROANS) Where's my vagina? - Has she prolapsed? - I really can't tell. Looking good, Soph. Where's Ziggy? Where's my husband? - On his way. - Call him. - I don't have his number. - What's his number? What are you going to call her? Little Audrey. Oh, Soph, that is so... It was my grandma's name. Was it? ARROW: That's it, folks! Thanks for dancing. You guys enjoy your weeks, OK? Oh, my God. It's the placenta. - It's coming. It's coming. - Oh, God. Oh, here it comes. Good girl, good girl, good girl. Push it out. Oh! Oh! Ugh. - That is... - Ugh... Sorry. - No. - OK. Just keep her eye on the baby. You don't need to see that. Well, just be grateful she didn't shit herself, yeah? (DRY RETCHES) I'm sorry. Shame and Cotemporary Motherhood and the polemics of making the right decisions as mothers and women and conceptualising stigma through personal experiences. - My experiences. - Great. That's cool. Got no problem with that. Yeah, so, really interrogating why we attach shame to so many decisions that we make as mothers. You know, the role of community, culture and isolation in all of that. Yep, yep, yep. You know, looking at shame as a psycho-social-cultural construct. Yep. That's actually way more interesting. Thank God! Um, I can suggest some reading material. Great. And I'd like to do some qualitative surveys, too. Sure. OK, great. We also have some post-grad research scholarships specifically for mature-age... returning students that you can apply for. Ooh! I will. (LAUGHS) What are they worth? - Two to five K. - Ah. Not good enough for you? Oh, no. No, that's good. Useful. Alright, well, let's get everything in order so we can get you moving. Oh, and have you heard of the on-campus childcare? - Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. - Great. Well, do you want me to get you an application form? Yeah, she's actually there now, doing a trial. Oh. Actually, you need to sign this, so I can get the student discount. It's just a bonus. Thank you. AMBROSE: And I have to say that in the 35 years that I've been doing this, I have noticed a huge shift. And I think it's got a lot to do with expectations. Not just of motherhood, of life, and women. There's so much pressure to be perfect now. You know, the perfect mother, partner, employee, friend, woman. And it's impossible, obviously, but I get the sense that a lot of women think they're failing, when they're not. They're just not meeting these ridiculous expectations. And I suppose the idea of motherhood's changed. It keeps changing. It's, um, about so much more than mothering now. But babies will always be babies. That stuff never changes. And they're wonderful. Uh, is that OK? 'Cause we're going to have to reconvene if not, because I've got a new group waiting outside. Oh, that was perfect. You go. I'll pack up. - Thanks. - You were my last one. - Ah! - Thanks, Ambrose. That's alright. You were perfect, too, Stevie. Right, everyone settled in? May as well start. So has the novelty worn off yet? You've probably realised that this is permanent. Unrelenting. The new world order. And there's no escaping it. Hey, Stevie. Look at all the bubbas. Yeah, it's a big responsibility. Where'd she go? Oh, fuck! Shit! Sorry, forgot Stevie. (LAUGHS) And that'll happen. A lot, for some of you. Alright, here we go. Birth stories and names. No judgements. Who's first? She's definitely not out here? No? - No. - OK. ♪ Silver and gold never seemed so inviting ♪ ♪ Something to shine in the dark, let the light in ♪ ♪ Changes of course and wolves in the doors can ♪ ♪ Peek through the cracks, see what's in store ♪ ♪ Anything can happen when you're just like me ♪ ♪ I'm running carelessly through a maze ♪ ♪ How unexpected ♪ ♪ I'm under lock and key ♪ ♪ In a world of relentless passion ♪ ♪ Anything can happen when you're just like me ♪ ♪ I'm running carelessly through a maze ♪ ♪ How unexpected ♪ ♪ I'm under lock and key ♪ ♪ In a world of relentless passion. ♪
