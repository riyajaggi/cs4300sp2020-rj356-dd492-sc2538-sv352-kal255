 Scott & Bailey (2011â€“2016): Season 3, Episode 1 - Episode #3.1 - full transcript 
 Elderly Eunice Bevan's corpse is discovered in her house whilst her bed-ridden,ailing husband Joe lies in the room above. With no sign of forced entry it looks as if the killer was one of the Bevans' children but the only one still around is daughter Helen and she claims to have had no contact with them for thirty years. Joe however is convinced he heard Helen argue with her mother and she is arrested. Helen tells Rachel that when she was growing up the parents abused her and her siblings,one of whom committed suicide whilst Janet,now acting sergeant,sees that Joe is far more mobile than he claims and the police reason that one of the two must be the killer. Rachel is less sure that she did the right thing in marrying Sean and can also do without the reappearance of her loud,drunken mother Sharon.

 Hey, listen, I've bought enough booze to sink a battleship with, Sammy. That is the equivalent of buying twice as much as I think we'll need. Yes, I do want you to have a good time. I want you to have a great time. Well, it isn't about you and your mates. It's about you and Orla. Hey, and make sure she brings this famous engagement ring. I want to see it. I'm putting the phone down now. I'm going. I don't want to knock any little old ladies down

 or I'll be living with the consequences. Hey, kid, have you hoovered? What the hell are you doing? Shut up, bitch. Eight Months Earlier Start again. I wasn't listening. This woman? This woman comes knocking on our door, half past eight last night. She lives down the road. I don't know her particularly. I've seen her around. She's very nice. She's very friendly. Cutting to the chase... So, anyway, she says, "I'm worried about No.29 down here. "I haven't seen her for most of the week.

 "And you never see him, he's bedridden." - Yeah? Is he? - Anyway, the thing is... this house... it's creepy. It's weird. It's one of those ones that you'd run past if you were a kid, just in case... whatever. Anyway. Then she goes, "And there's this smell. If I had to put a word to it", she says, "it'd be evil". Hello, hello. - Hiya. - I've tried the doors and windows but I think you might have to force entry. - Nobody local, might have a key? - Afraid not. It's your call, lads. Jesus Christ. Hello? Police! Police! Hello! Hello, Police! There's a severed human head at the bottom of the stairs. - Nice. - Yeah. Well, not really. Not if it's in the next street. I rang Division. Half an hour later, Her Majesty's en route. Going downhill, this neighbourhood, eh? You're so funny, you should be on television. Brian, what have we got? Elderly woman. Body at the top of the stairs, head at the bottom. In the front bedroom up here is an old fella. - Dead? - Bedridden. Jesus. How long's he been there? Days, I'd say. And there's blood everywhere. - Do you know these people? - Not really. Well... No. Have we got an ambulance on the way for him, then? Yeah. Bit of a dilemma for the CSM. That's if the paramedics are even willing to go in there. What's the old fella's name, do we know? Joseph - Joe - Bevan. Joe. So me and the CSM pop up and have a look at him. He's dehydrated, emaciated, macerated. He can barely speak. Dementia, possibly, I don't know. The lights are on but there's no-one home. I allow the paramedics up there under strict instructions. I've lost something from the scene, letting them up and down stairs. But Eunice Bevan, Joe's wife, 75 years old, she's been decapitated. Head at the bottom of the stairs, body at the top. Blood everywhere. All down the floor, her side of the bed, all the way out along the landing. House is a shithole. God knows where social services are. No signs of a break-in. Interviewing Joe is a priority. - Is he fit? - We'll find out, won't we? He's at Oldham General. Locating the next of kin. We've been told there's two daughters but nobody seems to know anything about them. House-to-house. I want to know when Eunice was last seen alive. Let's make it quick and dirty. But the immediate neighbours, let's spend a bit more time with them. Somebody, hopefully, heard something. This was a brutal, vicious, God knows what sort of an attack. Your lady that came knocking at your door last night, let's have her in. I want intelligence on Eunice, on Joe, on the house, on these daughters - if they exist. Social services, local authorities, medical records. When did she last collect her pension? I want a timescale we can start working with. Right. Can you get me Eunice's medical records? - Yeah, sure. - Don't put me on disclosures. - You're on disclosures. - Kevin. - Boss? - You got a minute? I'm sorry to have to tell you that you didn't pass your sergeant's exam. Seriously? That's it. Sorry, I've got a meeting with the CSM. So... did... Are there any specific areas I can improve or...? You're not a bad copper, Kevin. But I have to tell you, I sometimes I sometimes think your skills might be better utilised outside MIT. Janet! - Denise, give me two minutes! - OK, Boss! Can you clear enough space to talk to Joe Bevan yourself? I can try. It'll be like wading through treacle blindfolded with your hands tied behind your back but let's assume he was there when it happened and you'll need to get his DNA and his fingerprints. - Can I just remind you - - Yeah. You're acting sergeant. You're not permanent. I am totally, fully, completely aware. It has been eight months. Bear with me. How did he take it? I implied he might be happier elsewhere. Joe, we're going to find out what happened to Eunice. We need you to help us, Joe. Eunice... That's right. - Your wife, Eunice. - Eunice... Anything you can tell us, Joe, will be helpful. Anything you can remember. I... You...what, Joe? I... couldn't help her. Who was in the house, Joe? When it happened, who was in the house? Joe. Is there any family we can contact, Joe? Anybody we can contact? So I had a shuftie through Eunice's medical records when I picked them up. And there isn't just two daughters. There's three daughters and a son. Sheila, Michael, Julie and Helen. Four kids and none of them ever visit. Yeah, well, families, eh? How is your mum? Don't ask. Ruptured varices on the lower oesophagus. Looks like the old love's a bit of an alcoholic. So she's in bed, the varices have ruptured, suddenly she's vomiting blood, all down her side of the bed. That's a likely scenario, and one I'm happy to live with but - She panics, goes out to the landing where she's still vomiting blood... Yes, good. But - But there's also marks on the back of the head consistent with being whacked by something hard. Mary's saying a cylindrical object, - three inches in diameter. - How was her head severed? She'd been lying at the stairs for upwards of four days. The old man, Joe, is bedridden and meanwhile, guess what, the dog's getting hungry because nobody's fed him. It ate her throat. Sandy the dog ate right through Eunice's throat. The head's become detached and gone off on a little Odyssey all of its own down the staircase. So... sorry, just going back... Somebody - something - hit the back of her head while she's vomiting blood? Somebody. It was done with force. It fractured her skull. This isn't her bumping her head. This is someone whacking her. If there's no sign of forced entry, that's got to be someone with a key or someone that's knocked on the door and talked - or forced - their way into the house. She was in bed when she started vomiting. She hadn't just let someone in. Or it was someone already in the house. Joe? Joe couldn't knock the skin off a rice pudding, really, literally. Just thinking about the timescale, have you picked up anything from the house-to-house? Well, Joe and Eunice seem to have gone under most people's radar. People knew that they were there but... What we do know is that she collected her pension last Monday, that's seven days ago, from the post office on Langdale Road. At the moment that's our last known sighting. We haven't identified any family yet but... But we know from her medical records that she's got four children so I'm following that up with credit checks now. I've got names, dates of birth, nothing more to go on as yet but... But we will find them. Last orders. No, I can't. I'm knackered. Last orders, Kev? Last orders, Mr. Readyough? Thought you'd stopped drinking. What is up with you - What is up with him? He's been off me for weeks. - You'll go for a drink, won't you, Lee? - Sorry. What's the matter, Mrs. Newly-wed? You're not trying to avoid going home, are you? Janet, got another ten minutes? - What's he doing up? - Hey! I did tell you. Jo and Mike are in Barcelona for a few nights so... I didn't say "What is he doing here?" I said, "What is he doing up?" We're just... He's nine years old. He should have been in bed... weeks ago. Yeah, a bit of a treat for him. You had a nice day? Yeah. Little old lady... got her head bitten off by her own dog. Lovely. Best ever. Yeah, well, he should be in bed. We'll just do this... this... Your mum rang. What did she want? You. - Hello. - Adrian asked me to come round. He had something on after school so... Till this time? What? I didn't ask. I don't mind. Your telly's bigger than mine. Happen he's seeing somebody. What makes you say that? Would it bother you if he was? I don't know. No, why would it? It just seems funny. Divorcing somebody and still living under the same roof. Well, until the house sells, we're stuck with it. Is he seeing someone? Do you honestly think I'd know before you did? - Ginny called. - Who? Ginny. Across. Sounds unpleasant, what happened. I think she needed somebody to talk to. - She seemed shaken. - Yeah, well, she will be. It's odd. They've lived in that house all their married life and people have come and gone all around them yet there's nobody left who knows anything about them at all. Sad. Who did it? Colonel Mustard, in the library with a sledge hammer. What is a sledge hammer? I've never been entirely sure. - I'll see myself out. - Thanks for coming. Oh, there's a casserole I've left warming for you in the oven. My God! You are perfect. - You need a wife. - I need something. - Good night. - Night-night. Here we go. Julie Bevan. Married name Duggan. Died. OK. 4th October 2012, age 50. Helen Bevan changed her name to Bartlett. Helen Bartlett, 28 Winchelsea Road, Bolton. - And that's it. - What about the other siblings? - No, nothing. - There must be something. Nope. OK. Well, let's work with what we've got. Helen Bartlett. Helen Bartlett. Well, I've got her National Insurance number so I'll find out where she works - if she works. What's up with Kevin? Failed his sergeant's exams. - Why is that funny? - It's not. - It's sad. Tragic. - It's not funny. - All right, I've stopped laughing. - Lad were gutted. Well, he must have known it was a possibility, - what with that one little lonely brain cell. - And you're Einstein? At least he turned up for his bloody exam. Have you and me got a problem? No. I don't think there's any cause to laugh just cos - I'm not laughing at him to his face, am I? No. You're laughing at him behind his back. What's up? Nothing's up. - Can I help you? - Helen? - Yes. - Bartlett. Yes. Manchester Metropolitan Police, Major Incident Team. I'm Detective Constable Bailey. This is Detective Constable Readyough. Is your mother Eunice Bevan? Why? Is there somewhere private we can go and talk? - Would you like to... - Thanks. Helen... Can I call you Helen? Sure. Helen, I'm sorry to have to tell you but the day before yesterday your mother was found dead at home on Peverall Street. Right. And I also have to tell you, Helen, that she died in circumstances that we are regarding as suspicious. Did she? I'm sorry. Did you already know that she was dead? No. You don't seem surprised, that's all. I...don't have anything to do with my parents. They're of no interest to me... at all. I'm sorry. Well, what we'd like to do is ask you some questions. You see, we have to build up a picture of Eunice's day-to-day around the time that she was last seen alive. And the best people to help us with that, obviously, are those that were closest to her. I wasn't... ..close to her. No. No, OK. But you might still be able to help us, though, Helen. You see, one of the first things that we need to ask you is we need to speak to your brother and your sister, Sheila and Michael, about what's happened. So if you could give us their contact details, addresses, phone numbers... Helen? I don't know where they are. Julie, my other sister, she died. She died last October. No, I... We knew that. It's Sheila and Michael that we're having trouble locating. Julie was the only one I had any contact with. Why's that? I can't help you and I don't know anything. You don't know where your brother and sister are? No. Could you describe to me your relationship with your mother? I... haven't seen my mother for over 30 years. I haven't set foot inside that house for over 30 years. Could you describe to me your relationship with her? Non-existent. And what was it like before it became non-existent? I... This has nothing to do with me. Do you have a key to your parents' house? No. Helen, is there anything that you can tell us about your mother's death? - No. - Are you aware of anyone that might have wanted to hurt your mother? Look, I've had nothing to do with them since I was 15. I know nothing about their life. Anybody they bother with, anybody who bothers with them, I am probably the last person in the world who can help you with this. I'm sorry... I'm sorry, I'm going to have to go outside. OK. Are you all right? I'm just... I can't breathe. Describe to me what happened, Joe. I don't... I were asleep. They woke me up, shouting and... There was somebody else. Who? Out...out there, on the landing. Voices. Can you describe the voices, Joe? The voice, the voices? - Yes. It... - Young? Old? - Women. - What were they saying? Nasty. Being nasty to Eunice. I said... "Leave her alone, you bitches... you bitches". What did they say? Nasty. Just nasty. Proper nasty. Did you recognise the voices? It was our Julie and our Helen. So...we explained to Joe that he couldn't have heard Julie's voice because she is, in fact, dead. Which surprised him, certainly upset him. He was upset because he was confused, I thought, - not because we told him she - - Well, yeah, maybe. I don't know but the point is he did still insist that it was Helens' voice he heard. And the another. Well, he wasn't sure, once we'd said about Julie. But he was very clear about having heard Helen's voice. How's he going to recognise her voice? She hasn't been there since she was 15. According to her. Any news about Michael and Sheila? He said that he hasn't seen them for years. We could push that further if it's a priority. - Has intelligence not - - Nothing. Did you ask him about his bruises, up his arms? And his burn? He said that someone had poured scalding hot...something on him. He didn't know who or what. It was dark. He said it was last Wednesday night when it happened. They'd been watching Coronation Street. In bed, obviously. And he described something that happened in the story... - and Janet's mum - - I checked with my mum and it was definitely last Wednesday's episode. Did he see her - Helen? No. He didn't but I think there are reasons to take this seriously despite his confusion about Julie. His first words... were... "There was someone out there on the landing. I heard a voice". So his first impression, whether or not he was aware of it, is that there was one person there, not two. If he's making the accusation, we're following it up, I don't care how old or ill he is. - Pulling her in? - Helen? Arresting her. I want her house searched. Clothes, shoes, blood. Whoever went in there didn't come out clean. Let's work up an arrest strategy, Janet, and let's be knocking on her door first thing tomorrow morning. Can I... Can I stay at your house tonight? Oh, come on. He can't be that bad. He's only nine. No, it's not Hayden. I don't mind Hayden. It's him. Sean. He... He bores me shitless. I could handle it when it was every other night but - You've only been married five minutes. And he snores. I knew it was a mistake. - You're just tired. - No, Janet, that's not the problem. - Night, ladies. - Night. It's a shock, getting married. That relentless proximity. You will get used to it. I'm sleeping on the settee. Not every night but... I don't want to be one of those people that get divorced after five minutes. Everyone'll laugh. Everyone'll say "We never saw that one coming!" He does love you, you know. Yeah. Yeah, it just doesn't go very deep with Sean. Anything. The thing that you do realise very quickly after you've got married is that women really are from Venus and men are from the Planet Zog. No, I think it's just about working your way through that one, really, isn't it? Oh, come on. Give it another five minutes. You can piss off as well. Do you really want to sleep at ours? No. Manchester Metropolitan Police, Major Team Incident, looking for Helen Bartlett. - She's still in bed. - All right if we come in? - What's your name, love? - Louise. - Louise what? - What's happening? Helen? Can you hear me, Helen? It's DC Bailey, Manchester Met Police. Came to talk to you at work yesterday. Do you remember? Helen... I'm arresting you... on suspicion of murder. Helen, do you understand me? You're not obliged to say anything but it may harm your defence... Up your arse, bitch. How are you feeling, Helen? I'm sorry I swore at you. I've had worse. I didn't do this. The reason I said it... The reason I got so wasted last night is because... The whole thing. Yesterday, what you told me. It brought back things... I've spent my whole life trying to forget. Things? It wasn't a very nice house to grow up in. Why? Helen? Is this being recorded? Yes. My sister... Julie, she... She killed herself. She'd come back to live with us. Me and... She'd lost another job and... things hadn't gone right with her for a while. They never did, really. It was always worse for her than it was for me. She... took some pills. I found her. They did things. They... did things to us. They? Both of them. What things? What things, Helen? I think I'm just a bit more resilient than Julie was. Not on the surface but... It's why we left. It's why we never went back. But we still had to live with it. And then... she couldn't any more so... We never talked about what happened. Who... Which of them hurt you the most? They were both as bad as each other. Are you talking about sexual abuse? Do you want to talk about that to someone? No. - Well, it might help. - No. But it's why I drink... sometimes. I think that's all. OK, Helen. So you're aware that this interview is being recorded. And just to clarify, you've been arrested regarding the death of your mother, Eunice Bevan. Do you understand that? Yes. So, I asked you this yesterday and I'm going to ask you again. Is there anything that you can tell me about your mother's death? No. OK. Can I take you back to last Wednesday? Can you remember what you were doing last Wednesday? Last Wednesday, I was at work, where you met me yesterday. And what time did you finish work last Wednesday? Six o'clock. I always finish at six o'clock. And that's when you left the shop? I leave at ten past. And then what did you do? I got the bus home. - Straight home? - Yes. What bus did you get? The X3 from... Cranworth Street. I got in at five past seven. I always get in at five past seven. And what did you do when you got in? Nothing. Louise, my partner, she cooked. We had supper, watched telly... for a bit. - Then I went to bed. - What time did you go to bed? Probably... usually about eleven, quarter to eleven. And did you leave the house again that night? No. He's brighter today. It's amazing the difference when someone's had three days' worth of proper meals inside them. Is there anything else that you'd like to tell me about Michael or Sheila, Joe? I've said all I know, love. Can you remember the last time that you actually spoke to them? They were took into care. Well... You didn't mention that before. Did I not? Are you married? When? How old were they? I don't know... Late teens. They were wild, pair of 'em. Forever in bother. Eunice... she couldn't handle 'em. Do you know where they went? No. They always used to be lesbians, women who joined the police. Were they adopted or fostered? You know as much as me. If I could remember, I'd tell you. - Are you a lesbian? - Joe, these were your own children. If I could remember, I'd tell you. OK. Let's go back to last Wednesday. I could murder a cigarette. Mitch had some fags. Yeah, I gave him the packet and my lighter, wondering what he thought he was going to do with them, given that we were three floors up. - And he took one... - Got out of bed, walked across to the window and smoked it. I had to help him open the window but... there was certainly nothing wrong with his legs. We were just gawping at each other. We spoke to the doctor after. He's got emphysema, which they've only just diagnosed, but other than that, there is nothing that would physically stop him getting out of bed if there was something he wanted to do badly enough - is the point. If he wanted to whack his missus round the back of the head, for instance, while she was spewing her guts up. He's been bedridden for years. She's waited on him, hand and foot. She gets sick of being treated like a skivvy so she indulges in a bit of domestic abuse, pouring scalding hot tea on him - those bruises on his arms. So when he sees her in a vulnerable position, he sees his chance... And he takes it. Why didn't he raise the alarm? After she's dead? After she's rotting? I... Maybe he realised that um... he hadn't thought it through properly. I don't know. Maybe... I don't know. Ma'am... Sorry. We've just run the AMPR checks on the vehicle belonging to the girlfriend, Helen's... It was picked up six times last Wednesday night going towards Oldham and back. Bitch? Louise, your partner, has a car, a blue Vauxhall Corsa. - Yes. - Who drives that car? - Both of us. - Who else? No-one. So no-one else is insured to drive it or...? No, not that I know of. She does the insurance, though, not me. But no. No-one else drives it. So, when you and Louise were in, last Wednesday night, your car - your and Louise's car - would have been parked where? In front of the house. And when you and Louise were in, last Wednesday night, is there any reason why that car might not have been parked there? No. OK. So how would you respond, Helen, if I told you that we'd picked up six sightings of your vehicle travelling between Bolton and Oldham last Wednesday night? Was that Wednesday? I... thought that was Thursday. No, Helen. That was Wednesday. Right. And when we get the CCTV footage back of your car driving over to Oldham, who are we going to see in it, do you think? Will it be you? Or Louise? Or both of you? Have we got her? It was me. It was me... It was me driving the car. Towards Oldham? OK. So where were you going? Cos you must have been going somewhere. I... - Would you like some water? - No. You've become very upset, Helen. Yes, I have... Did you go to your parents' house? No. Where did you go, Helen? I drive round sometimes. Do you accept that it was Wednesday? Yes, if that's what you're telling me. OK, so you went for a drive. Could you tell me what streets you drove along? - Stop it! - Can we have a break? No. Keep on at her. Yeah, sure. Twit. Just... supposing... I know she's on the back foot, but just playing devil's advocate for a second, just supposing it is Joe who found the stamina to do this thing - - It's her! - I'm thinking! Whatever. If it was him, whatever he used to clunk her on the head, can't have gone very far, can it? He might not be bedridden but he didn't go out of the house. He probably doesn't go downstairs. Has Denise's lot not found anything that fits the bill as regards a weapon? How would you get rid of something if you couldn't leave the house? Lob it out the window. I would. How have you prioritised the garden for searching? It's way down. We can pull it up. It's a shithole. It's like the house. It's an absolute junkyard. I'll ring Denise. Yeah. Thanks, cock. Ta-ta. Is it him or is it her? And where the hell are Michael and Sheila? - Legenda sem tradu?ao - They abused her. Her and her sister. Both of them did, when they were kids. Sexual and physical abuse. She told me before we started the interview. And that's why her sister died. She killed herself. - It's a motive. - Yeah, I know that but I'm not... I'm not making excuses for her. I'm just... I'm wondering why she didn't kill him as well. I would have done. - In fact - - What? I'm just thinking, why now? If she's angry about something that happened 30 years ago? Well, I don't think that ever goes away. I know but a trigger. Now. If she was close to her sister... Did she find her? Yeah. Pills. - You see, that could - - Boss, the tactical aid unit sent over a number of keys that they found at Helen's house. This one fits Eunice and Joe's front door. She told Rachel and Pete she didn't have a key to her parents' house. She's had ten minutes. Get back in with her. I don't know. Don't know. It isn't mine. I don't think I ever had a key to that house. Maybe it was Julie's. Maybe she left it there. That's a long time to keep a key. Don't you think? 30 years. If it's not being used. Don't know. Things.. .just get left in drawers sometimes for years, don't they? You know when I mentioned earlier that we'd be getting the CCTV footage of your car, Helen, it won't be just to see who's in it. It'll be to see much more clearly where it went. So, did you go to your parents' house last Wednesday evening? - No. - Did you use this key to let yourself into your parents' house? - No. - So where did you go? If you weren't at your parents' house, where were you? Well, I wouldn't blame her if she did. Adrian's seeing someone. He's had my mum round the last couple of nights, looking after the girls so I asked him straight out and he said, "Yeah, I am". Eleanor Goodhead. Assistant Deputy Head. - Oh, gosh! - Yeah. - So what's she like? - She's... I knew he was seeing someone because he's been all happy. Yeah, I know but if you're getting divorced - No, yeah. I... It's fine. It's fine. I mean, why shouldn't he? Obviously, it's fine. I'm just a bit... jealous. No, I am. I wish I could fall in love with someone. I wish that there was someone I could really fall in love with. Not that I have time to do anything about it. Will you tell her? - "I don't want to be a bloody sergeant!" -I keep bloody telling her! But I just get this guilt trip shit like, "Oh, bear with me". Are you feeling sorry for her? No. Shall we get a bottle? - Shit. - What? That's her. It is, isn't it? Yeah, yeah, it is. So... I'll be loving you and leaving you. - Did she just...? - Yeah. She's just flashed her Charlies. - Why does she do that? - Maybe it's something like attention seeking? Has she ever been diagnosed with anything? Dunno. Haven't got a clue. Hey! Our Alison said this is where you... hang out. Been here for hours. Are you here on your own? I was with...Frank. Frank. But he's gone. - Who's buying? - Who's Frank? You don't know him. - Who's buying? - I think you've had enough. Ooh, are you not going to get your mummy a little drink? - No! - Hey, why have you been ignoring my text messages? What do you want? Well... some respect would be nice, for a kick-off. I keep telling you, Mother, I will respect you when you start to respect yourself. No, forget that. I need to get her in a cab. Fair enough. Never texts me back. She's very busy. - I'm very proud of her. - She knows. Right. Come here. 15 quid. She'll try and persuade you to give her the cash back and pay you with a blow job instead. Don't let her. Oi! I'm serious. I'm a police officer and I'll know. You all right? Do you want me? Helen Bartlett's had a really bad night in the cells, apparently, and she wants to talk. Marvellous, isn't it, how it focuses the mind, a night on a hard surface with two very thin blankets and a metal toilet with no seat for a companion? I can't do enclosed spaces. Dark and being on my own. No, it's not pleasant. I went to Ardwick Street. Ardwick Street? It's where you... It's where you can pick people up. For money. Women. I... paid a woman. She knows me. I've been there before. Do you know her name? Rihanna. I don't know if that's her real name. What does she look like? She's about 19. Thin, blonde. Tattoo. She does it cos she needs the money cos she's got... - a habit. - Surname? I don't know. I always give her more money than she asks for. She knows me. OK, Helen, just to clarify, when we check out the CCTV, which we will do, this is where we'll see you go? Yes. That's where you'll see me go. OK. Just had a result back from the lab on one of those items from the garden we had fast-tracked. Stone jar, three-inch diameter. Smashed, as in dropped from a great height. Blood - Eunice's. Single fingerprint in the blood. Guess whose. Joe's. Well done, Kevin. Poor Helen. She was so embarrassed. I nearly said, "Hey, I worked in Vice for two years. " It really isn't that unusual". - Where's... - Home. He's been discharged. Hi. Bloke who lives here. Have you seen him? - Has he been - - Ambulance dropped him off. I told him he couldn't come in. He wandered off that way. - Shit. - Where would he go? - Nobody knew him. - Yeah, right, where would you go? How long since? - Half an hour. - Shit. Where do you go when you've got nowhere to go? Me? - Starbucks? - Pub. Hello, Joe. I can't get in my house. They won't let me in. I wouldn't worry about that just now. I'm arresting you on suspicion of murder. You do not have to say anything but any - - Bitch! - Joe! ..may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned - something you later rely on in court. - You nasty, filthy bitch!
