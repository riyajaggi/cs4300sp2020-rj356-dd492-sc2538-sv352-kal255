 Previously on "Emergence"... Is she a human body with a synthetic AI? Synthetic everything. I got something called cancer. These are making me better. No, they're not. Emily was, uh, packing this, and it looked important, so I nicked it. Wanna see what's inside? Ow! I think I know someone who can crack this.

 April: I don't mess around with that stuff anymore. Too much risk. The hard drive -- that was my insurance policy. Okay. That is the only thing keeping me alive. I recently lost some specialized technology, which could be dangerous to you. Jo: Let me take you somewhere. I can keep you safe. Don't open up for anyone but me. If a job feels wrong, you walk away. You should do the same. [ Gunshots ] [ Glass shatters, tires squeal ] [ Car horn blaring ] [ Inhales sharply ]

But I need to know who the hell this guy is and what the hell is going on. He's a reporter. He's been helping me investigate what happened with Piper. You mean these -- these alleged medical experiments? Yeah, something like that. "Something like that" is not an answer. Abby, I know. How did he end up shot? Are you up for telling both of us? Yeah. I-I literally just saved your life. [ Sighs ] A-Alright. My friend was helping decrypt files that might explain Piper's...condition. But she said she wanted to stop, that she was afraid.

Look at what he's willing to do. It's not worth it. Walk away. No. Even if we stop, he won't. The only way this ends is if we bring him down. [ Police sirens wail ] What is this?

"the rest of your life," so -- That's not always accurate, though. I'm not asking because I'm bored. I'm not bored. I'm thinking of you.

But once we arrive, you're gonna find the real world was waiting just outside this car the entire time. You think you know where your power begins and mine ends, and I'm sure that's very comforting, but it's a fantasy. So, I'll say it again -- I'm thinking of you. ♪♪ So, ghosts, then? Yeah, you got it. Great. ♪♪ Are you from Australia? N-- From Wales. It's right next door to England. Are there whales in Wales? O-Occasionally, yeah. Have you ever seen a whale? I don't think so. Why did someone shoot you? Ed: Hey. Less talking, more eating. How long are you gonna stay with us? I'm sure that Benny wants to get home as soon as he possibly can. Yeah, you know what? That's, um -- That's absolutely right. I, uh... Thank you for your hospitality, but I really should get going. Smells like pancake o'clock up...in... Morning. Dad, this is Benny. He got shot.

Is this a movie that you saw? He has unlimited resources and access to high-end technology. Yeah, he -- he remotely killed his own guy via Bluetooth. Okay, I know how that sounds. I feel like you don't. Until today, we had nothing tying him or the company to any of it, but now we do. You mean the vehicle used in yesterday's shooting? Registered to his company. And reported stolen a week ago. Eh, t-that's not possible. I ran those plates myself last night. There was nothing about it being stolen. Marcus, this is them. They changed the records somehow. Jo...

She used, like, pipe cleaners. [ Sighs ] And I didn't think it connected. [ Camera shutter clicks ] Excuse me. What was that for? Nothing. Benny, don't do anything stupid. Doesn't matter what I do. He'll be ten steps ahead of us, anyway. Get off that. I'm bored. Yeah, well, you almost burned yourself with your little modem trick up there, so maybe find a new hobby. Okay, r-real easy solution to all of our problems. Just give me my drive back, and I'll get out of your life. [ Sighs ] Kindred killed the woman who was decrypting it. Drive's gone. Then I'm dead. Emily. [ Sighs ] Can you get the files again? What? The -- The once-in-a-lifetime files from Kindred's personal server? No. I mean, I'm sure that he's locked it down. It's impenetrable now. There's gotta be another way. You need to accept reality. We are boned. I'm getting out of here. What about stuff not on his personal server? What about the server at the law firm or accounting firm? The financial planner? Interesting. Think you can get in? I mean, yeah. Probably. But they're not gonna have anything on his AI division. I just need an opening. Evidence of a crime.

Let's get Mia. ♪♪ [ Knock on glass ] [ Gasps ] [ Door opens ] ♪♪ [ Exhales sharply ] [ Door closes ] So, what's the plan here? April's computer is somewhere inside that building. Sooner or later, he's gonna have to show his face. And then what? You gonna kill the guy? I'm not gonna kill anyone. I don't even have a gun. So, what? Are you gonna beat the crap out of him? You remember that you have a hole in your shoulder? He killed April. I know. But if we can arrest him and get him to talk, we can actually start to build a case against Kindred.

I do. Alan Wilkis. Co-founder of Augur Industries and, I suspect, my anonymous source when I first investigated Kindred. Why do you suspect that? Well, the source went dark the moment Wilkis died. He's dead? Why is a dead guy on a hit list? So, uh, the house is in Westchester. Wilkis's widow still lives there, and, according to local PD, there was a reported break-in three days ago. Benny: Wilkis was notoriously secretive. Much of his research supposedly disappeared with him. Jo: How long ago did he die? Four years. Sailing accident. Why are they searching now? Emily: I got in. To what? The lawyers. Believe it or not, their security is even worse than yours. Found something on Kindred? No. All that was removed from the server. But guess who had the same lawyer? Wilkis. And I found his revised -- but never executed -- contract with Augur Industries. That's dated two days before Wilkis died. "...shall become irrevocable... upon his death, all shares of Augur Industries stock shall be given to Maria Wilkis." His widow. But since the contract was never signed, the shares go to Kindred. He killed him. Look into it. [ "Baker Street" plays ] ♪♪ And Mr. Matthews said that there's some people that think that we're not even who we are, that we're, like, puppets being controlled by something else. And this is what they're teaching you in school? Yes. In real school? Yes! Just think about it, Grandpa. Eh, I did. It's dumb. It's interesting. [ Chuckles ] No, it's not. [ Laughs ] Where's the hand? What hand? In the puppet? Well, it's not a real puppet. It's more like the idea of one. [ Clears throat ] I don't believe that. I just think it's really interesting. Something's wrong. Ooh... [ Engine revs ] Grandpa, wake up. No, Grandpa, please wake up. Grandpa. [ Tires squealing ] [ Truck horn honks ] [ Tires squeal ] [ Truck horn honks ] ♪♪ ♪♪ Are you okay?
