 Previously on "Emergence"... A plane crashed on the beach and then was cleaned up pretty much instantaneously. The plane took off from Plum Island. I found a kid at the crash site I'm being told wasn't even on the plane. Whatever's going on, it is not that little kid's fault. She's bringing danger into our lives. [ Metal creaks ] Aah! Unh! What is this?

 It's her. The disk is her. How many others are out there? [ Breathing shakily ] Jo: Could be anybody. Piper: I'm going to fix Benny. I don't care about Benny. I just care about you. What is that? A light switch. To make sure that you don't accidentally hurt anyone. No! [ Pounding ] Help! Hello, Jo. [ Gun cocks ] Benny... I can help you to be like me.

 You did it. [ Clank ] [ Grunts ] The FBI's been looking into Splinter. If you're interested, we can make this our own little joint task force. You get the collar, and you leave Piper alone. You don't want to share your gifts with me. [ Metal clanking, rattling ] You can give me what I want... [ Squish ] ...or I can take it. [ Squish ] Run. [ Gunshot ] [ Brooks groans ] ♪♪ You know, you and I are a lot alike. Because you dressed me in your clothes. I can put you back in your prison uniform if you like. No. These are nice. It's expensive fabric. It's dry clean only, right? You and I, we're... innovators. I suppose you can say we're mothers, Emily. [ Cart rattling ] Mothers of the evolution. Mm. Thank you, Justin. [ Classical music plays ] You're going to help me, Emily. And in return, I'm going to help you. Even more than I have already. Sorry, uh... how have you helped me? A brilliant mind like yours shouldn't be locked up behind bars. You should be celebrated, nurtured... and well-compensated. In the course of our work, we've accumulated... more assets than we need. All of that is yours for the taking, if you do one thing for me. And what is that? I want what Piper has. ♪♪ Well...I can talk to Chief Evans and see if she wants to adopt you. No promises. Piper's abilities are unique. I want you to replicate them. Expand on them. For me. Yeah. That all sounds great. ♪♪ [ Crackling ] [ Knife clatters ] [ Crackling stops ] Neat. Can you all do that? No. So, you're special. Like Piper. What do you need me for? You have found the key. And I want you to use it. To unlock everything. Sounds fun. Let's try it. Well, that was just a test, and you failed. So you won't be working on my code. You'll be working on Justin's. Hi, again. And if you fail... this knife will end up in your throat, not mine. And I bet you're more of a bleeder than I am. ♪♪ ♪♪ [ Line ringing, click ] This is Special Agent Ryan Brooks. Leave a me-- Alright, look, don't -- don't pull her arm off. She's fine, Grandpa. Ow. Hi. Ow! What -- What is happening? We're trying to get the bracelet off. Nothing's working. I'm okay. Okay. Let me see this. Try again. Oh, you know what? I have a reciprocating saw. Mia: That's a good idea. Right? No. No, it's not. No. Terrible idea. Maybe Dad knows a way. See, that's a good idea. Alright? We will ask him when he gets here. Oh, no. He's not coming. He has a meeting. Yeah. I'm taking Mia to school. He didn't tell you about that? No. He did not. So, does it hurt? No. I feel different, though. Different how? Like...fuzzy. Alright, well, listen, guys, I appreciate the effort, but this has "loss of limb" written all over it. We have to get it off her. Benny knows how. Benny is not gonna help us. Yes, he will. He's different now. He's like me. Listen to me, okay? Benny is really good at making people believe what he wants them to believe. And he did it to me. But he is nothing like you. Okay? We're gonna figure out that bracelet, okay? I promise. [ Line ringing, click ] Woman: Federal Bureau of Investigation. Agent Ryan Brooks, please. One moment. [ Cup thuds ] Man: Hello? Brooks. Where the hell have you been? Who's calling, please? Oh. Sorry, I was calling for Agent Brooks. Can you identify yourself? You know what? I-I'll call back. ♪♪ [ Line ringing, click ] Chris: Officer Minetto. Chris... I need you to check something for me. ♪♪ Hey. Uh, Emily never made it back to the detention center last night. [ Door closes ] Uh, I reached out to my contact at NYPD. They're gonna quietly do a welfare check at Brooks' place. Okay. Yeah, that's -- that's good. Hey, he's smart. I think he's alright. Sure. Yeah. Um, just let me know what NYPD says. Yeah, will do. Uh... he's been asking for you. Yeah, I'll bet he has. ♪♪ I'd like to remind you that while you're in custody, you have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can -- Jo, I've waived my rights. I'll cooperate any way I can. I promise. How many? What? How many of you are there? Oh. Um, I'm not sure. Guess. There could be thousands. Why? My purpose was to live a life. To collect data. What kind of data? Anything. Everything. And then at an appointed time, the data would be uploaded. When is the appointed time? I don't know. Soon. Who gets the upload? Our maker. Who's that? I don't know. You don't know. How is that possible? Because I was programmed not to ask, so I didn't. Jo, I know this is hard for you to understand -- What does Helen want with her? She wants Piper's abilities. Why? I don't know. I-I'm sorry. I don't know. Okay. You know what, Benny? Maybe I'm going about this all wrong. Uh, why don't you... [ Chair scrapes ] ...just tell me what you do know? Hmm? There's a device that Helen needs to facilitate the upload. We stole it from a defense contractor the night that you found us. What is it? It's, uh, some kind of power source, like a very powerful battery. I didn't see it, but I know that without it, the -- the upload can't happen. If the upload is successful... we're all gone. What does that mean? Everything is pulled out. Every memory, every bit of data. The bodies remain, but they'll be like empty shells. We will be gone, all of us. Including Piper. You have to stop it, Jo. Oh, I have to stop it, but you won't give me a single useful piece of information? Only Helen knows the whole plan. And where is Helen? Oh. You don't know! I was programmed to do this, okay? In the same way that I was programmed to -- to kidnap Piper and to lie to you. You have to understand, I didn't have any control -- You don't get to plead insanity on this. I think you knew exactly what you were doing from day 1! No. No. I-I'm not that person anymore. You're not a person at all. I'm as much as Piper is. No, you're not. [ Knock on door ] Uh, Chief, can I -- can I grab you for a second? The FBI is in the middle of raiding his apartment. What? Yeah, my friend couldn't even get close. He says that it's crawling with agents, and they're confiscating everything. I-I'll see what else I can find out. Yeah, thanks, Chris. [ Cellphone vibrating ] ♪♪ [ Vibrating stops ] Hello? Woman: [ British accent ] Bay Harbor Hospital. Room 220. Who is this? [ Click ] ♪♪ [ Quietly ] He showed up as a John Doe last night. No I.D., no gun, no phone. Nobody knows who dropped him off. [ Quietly ] How is he? Concussion. Looks like he was shot twice, but wearing body armor, so he's got a grazing wound on his arm and cracked rib. Oh, God. Jo. We did have a John Doe come in last night, and I treated him. I was just checking on him today. I'll stall them as long as I can. ♪♪ [ Shotgun cocks ] Emily: Brooks! Brooks: FBI! [ Gunshot ] [ Grunts ] Jo: Brooks, wake up. [ Gasps ] Evans. Hi. Hi, hi, hi. Okay, can you stand up? [ Groans ] Shh, shh, shh. Sit up for me. Come on. There we go. They got Emily. I know, and the FBI is here, and they're looking for you, so we gotta go right now, okay? Okay. [ Exhales sharply ] Ooh. Hey. Okay. Stay with me, alright? This is bad. Yeah. Let's just get you out of here, okay? I got you. [ Door opens ] They're on their way, Chief. Double time. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ Hi, Dr. Frasier. Hey...Walter. [ Quietly ] Oww. [ Quietly ] Let's go, let's go. Thank you, Walter. Don't be a stranger, Chief. I never want to see you again. Jo: Okay, so, your vehicle was towed to a repair shop in Hicksville, near where it broke down, but the FBI has it already. Yeah. Not surprised. I want to canvass the area, see if any of the security cameras picked up anything. Don't. I guarantee the FBI is there already. The towing company never found your phone, your I.D., or your gun, so... you know, consider that a loan. Practically working for you already. [ Scoffs ] Oof. Oh, God. Can you just, like... sit down or something? This isn't gonna work. I can't hide out here forever. You're not hiding forever. Just until we find Emily and get her back into custody. They got my computer. They'll read my e-mails. This is all gonna lead back to you. I doubt they care about me. [ Sighs ] [ Scoffs ] I should be dead. Yeah. For a minute, I kind of thought you were. No, but -- but somebody stopped them. The same person that brought me to the hospital. I have an idea who it is, but... it sounds crazy. ♪♪ Who? Helen? No. Not possible. I saw her. After sustaining a significant head injury? Helen's not in the business of giving rides to hospitals. You know what -- I think we've pretty much established that you have no idea what Helen was planning, so let's just assume that she was there last night. Now she's got Emily. Well, she'll have no need for Piper. Why not? Because I suspect that she'll have Emily write some new code for her so she can do what Piper does. And I cannot emphasize enough how bad that will be if that happens. What do we do? Let me out. No. I'm the only one who can get close enough to her. Helen still trusts me. Well, it's good somebody does. You get close to her. Then what? Stop her. How? By any means necessary. [ Chuckles ] What... Jo, please. I will do anything to earn your trust. Piper says you know how to take her bracelet off. Yes. I do. I could show you. And then will you trust me? Anything's possible. ♪♪ Emily: [ Scoffs ] She's acting like this is all part of my grand design. Well, joke's on you, Helen. All those amazing abilities Piper has were an accident -- a coding error. And I have no idea how to replicate it. And then her way of motivating me is threatening to stick a knife in my throat, and who can work under those conditions? Nobody. This is insane. [ Sighs ] Or karma. Might be karma. [ Keyboard clacking ] Do you believe in karma, Justin? I don't. It's stupid. If there was actually karma, Piper and I would be a happy family. But no. Jo had to come along and wreck the whole thing. And if we are all being honest, this is 100% her fault. This whole sitch. I made Piper. And what? Then Jo comes along and plucks her out of some plane wreckage, and all of a sudden, she's the hero? She sounds awful. This Jo. I hate her for you. I-I mean [Chuckles] who the hell does she think she is? Yeah. Right? Thanks...Justin. ♪♪ What do you think? I think he'll do or say anything to get me to cut him loose. What about the bracelet thing? Don't you start buying into that now. Turn around. Turn around. Turn around. [ Clears throat ] What? FBI just showed up, looking for him. Chris is trying to get rid of them, but they're saying that they know he's here and they know you got him out of the hospital. How many? Two. Grab my keys. Put them in my car. Got it. Wait a minute. Okay, if we can get to my vehicle, we can take it down the alley. Evans. You can't go back to the city, though. Evans. What about the ferry? Orient Point will go through Connecticut, so -- [ Sighs ] What are you doing? Only thing I can do. No. Brooks, don't be a jerk. I'm not a jerk, but I'm not gonna run from the FBI the rest of my life, either. Well, then let's find Emily and get you some leverage. There is no leverage. I lost a prisoner. That's on me. It's because I dragged you into this. No, you didn't. I did it because I wanted to. [ Inhales deeply ] And now I have to own up to it. You -- Brooks, wait. Just hold on a second. Okay, that -- They will prosecute, alright? I mean, you -- you don't come back from this. I know. I still wouldn't have done it any other way. ♪♪ Okay. ♪♪ Mm -- ♪♪ ♪♪ Brooks, I -- Hmm? I just feel like you're being really dramatic right now. What? I mean, it's not like I'm never gonna see you again. I don't really know what you're doing right now. Why do you have to ruin everything? Why? You're not going off to war, so -- You're a nightmare. Get out of my way. Um... Don't disappear again, though. I'll try. ♪♪ ♪♪ [ Door opens ] Alright. You ready? [ Bracelet whirs ] It worked. Mm-hmm. How'd you figure it out? Oh, you know. Grown-up magic. Benny told you. ♪♪ Yeah. Benny told me. [ Inhales deeply ] But all that means is that he is very smart. He's changed, Jo. We don't know that. I know that. You can't know that. He could have hurt you -- or worse -- but he didn't. Because Chris was there. No. I can see it, Jo. Can't you just stop being mad at him? I can't, Piper. Even if I'm right? Even if you're right. [ Sighs ] Ryan, I don't know if you realize how bad this is. You took a prisoner out of lockup. She was involved in an ongoing investigation. Look, it sounds like this police chief is the problem, which could help you. She had an entire car dumped in the ocean? Destroyed evidence. She's not involved in this. Um, she's real involved. [ Door opens ] Let her take the heat. Hey. How's it going? Excuse me. We're in the middle of an interview. Yeah. You're doing great. I'm gonna take this over. So take a hike. Well, who the hell are you? ♪♪ Marshall: [ Sighs ] You know what? You go talk to your boss. He'll hold your hand and explain it to you. And...why don't you just leave all this here? ♪♪ Hey, man. [ Door closes ] That's a cute shirt. I can't believe we haven't met before. You know, your bona fides should've put you on my radar years ago. [ Chuckles ] I'll find out who to fire for that. Now...let's see what we got here, huh? I mean, you screwed up. Hard. Why is D.O.J. involved at this level? We're involved at all the levels, bud. [ Latches click ] One way or another. So... case closed. Go home, Agent Brooks. What? Yeah, I got you, uh... a new badge... new phone... and a new car. And you can, uh, sign yourself out a new service weapon. [ Latches click ] It'll be like none of this ever happened. For you and the lovely Southold police chief. Hey. Who's your friend? I'm your friend. ♪♪ I'm free to go? All free and clear. And, Agent Brooks, thank you for your time and your service and blah, blah, blah. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ If the feds pulled any security video from Hicksville, then they might've reached out to local law enforcement. So, uh, plates, uh, suspect description. Just see if you can dig anything up, okay? Thanks, Chris. [ Click ] [ Clatter ] ♪♪ ♪♪ G-- It's me. Geez. What are you -- Why aren't you in custody? I can't stay long. I'm being followed. What? I think I lost them, but I can't be sure. Okay, just come in. No. No. It's not safe. I hate to tell you this, but if you're being followed, they probably know about back doors. [ Door opens ] Listen. Jo? What's going on? Nothing, Dad. Just a little misunderstanding. Who is that? Oh, this is Agent Brooks. I think... you guys met...right? Uh, we are -- Go that way. We're gonna just -- I'll be right back. So, you think that the FBI is tailing you? I don't know. I have no idea what is going on. They should've fired me tonight, at least. Well, somebody's more interested in burying this than going after you. Who was the Justice Department guy? Never saw him in my life. Evans... you are all over their files. They know things about you that I didn't know about. You could be in real trouble. Okay. In fact, I think that's part of whatever this deal is they made with me. I keep my mouth shut, and they protect you, too. Well, I'm not taking that deal. And you aren't, either. I'm sorry. This is -- I -- I shouldn't have come here. No, you were right to. I just, um... I wanted to see you. ♪♪ Did you...dump a car in the ocean? Oh, wait, did I? Did you dump a car in the ocean, then somehow forget it? You know what? I remember this now. I did. I did. Uh, it was a magnet. [ Chuckling ] Jo, is there anything else you wanna -- Don't call me Jo. ♪♪ ♪♪ [ Gasps ] I think we should let them follow you. ♪♪ ♪♪ [ Engine shuts off ] ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ [ Gun cocks ] Freeze! Show me your hands. Jo, it's her. Get down on the ground. Down on the ground! Right now! Where's Emily? [ British accent ] I'm not who you think I am. Helen, keep those hands up. My na-- My name is Loretta. I'm the person who made Helen. ♪♪ Please -- Please, believe me. I'm not Helen. We can test that. You got the disk on you? Jo: No. The exabyte disk? May I ask what's on it? No, you may not. Well, I-I came to make a friend out of Agent Brooks, but if you have what I think you have, then perhaps I'm negotiating with the wrong person. You and I are not negotiating. You're telling me what's going on and what your evil twin is planning. What do you want to know? Everything. That's a lot. Guess you better start talking. 18 years ago, we, uh, intercepted a transmission of unknown origin. The two top suspects were China or Russia. Who's "we"? Who do you work for? Same government as you, Agent Brooks. We assumed that the information from the transmission was instructions on how to build a weapon. We were wrong. It was instructions on how to build an A.I. So, we did, and it was considered a success -- up until the day it torched our lab, all the source code, and murdered my entire team -- all because we found out that it was building its own A.I. Helen was the first one. Until recently, she's been a ghost. But you two have been remarkably successful in tracking her down. It's why I'm here. With an offer. Why should we trust you? Because I'm the person who saved your job. And your life. I built a device that can effectively end Helen, and I'm willing to share it with you, in exchange for the exabyte disk. You don't even know what's on it. Well, I'm assuming Piper's code. Who are you? I don't need Piper. Just the source code. And in return... you get the killshot. Why not just kill Helen yourself, hmm? [ Sighs ] I've tried, Agent Brooks. I'm running out of bones to break. Think about it. Just did. No. Helen isn't like the others. She cannot be stopped with conventional means. Well, then, we'll just have to think of something unconventional, won't we? ♪♪ ♪♪ [ Sighs ] The paperclip. It's light. I could practically lift it with my own mind. I'm trying. Hey, do you want to, um, wire directly into my brain? That's sweet. But no. The only thing to do now is to wait until Helen shows up and sticks a steak knife in my face. [ Scoffs ] I hate to hear you talk that way. Hey. Hey. Your mind... is fascinating. Your coding's meticulous. And at your core, I can see... you're a really cool person. Well, spoiler -- I'm super lame. No, you're not. [ Scoffs ] ♪♪ ♪♪ [ Rumbling ] [ Pulsating ] [ Grunts ] [ Pulsating continues ] [ Rumbling ] ♪♪ What...the hell is this? ♪♪ [ Slaps ] Aah! Why -- [ Pulsating intensifies ] ♪♪ Ow! Stop it! [ Pulsating intensifies ] Look. What is that for? I have no idea. Ohh! [ Coughing ] [ Cellphone chimes ] [ Computer beeps ] Whoa. Uh...Chief? My phone just came back online. From when we were tracking the boat. You're kidding me. Where is it? [ Pulsating ] I -- What is that? Daphne: Chief! Chief, come quick! [ Pulsating continues ] ♪♪ Jo: Daphne... I will explain all of this later. Go tell the others everything's fine and get the keys to the cell. Right now, Daph. [ Pulsating continues ] What the hell is this? The upload. Piper. [ Pulsating ] What -- Ohh! Piper. Piper. Piper! Mia: Piper, wake up! Is she breathing? It's starting. Everything okay? How's Piper? Uh... Yeah, I talked to her. She's okay. She said the upload's starting. Yeah. That's what it felt like. But somehow, it got interrupted. Benny... I'm gonna ask you a question, and I really need you to answer honestly. Is Helen on Plum Island? I have no idea. Plum Island. You mentioned it to me the first time we met. What is Plum Island? Benny, you said that the Augur jet took off from that island, but we ruled it out 'cause there was no airstrip. That was just a cover story that I invented. Nothing was ever there. W-Wait, are you saying that she's there now? What's on the island? Used to be a USDA research facility. Okay. Chris tracked his cellphone to that island. So I'm betting that means that Helen is there, too. Did you know? Jo, I swear to you, I didn't know. But if she is there, then we need to go. Right now. I wish I could trust you. Put him back in, will you? Chris: So, if you go in on this side, it's your best chance at staying under the radar. Okay. Call the Marine Division. Have them fuel up a boat for me. And set up my phone so I can track yours, okay? Yeah, I can make that work. Thanks. So...what is the actual plan here? I need you to contact Loretta and tell her she's got a deal. Hold on. We don't know that we can trust her. I don't trust her. And I sure as hell don't believe Benny and Piper are being uploaded to some Russian spies. It doesn't matter. If she has a weapon that can kill Helen, then we need it. And if she's lying, then we're where we are now, but I'm out of time. Listen... I'm going anyway, but I don't expect for you -- You know I'm in. ♪♪ ♪♪ She's here. [ Exhales sharply ] ♪♪ Is she just gonna stand there? She's just gonna stand there dramatically and we have to walk over to her? Come on. You have what I asked for? I want your guarantee -- whatever that's worth -- that this is not gonna be used to hurt Piper. It won't. We don't care about her. [ Sighs ] How does this work? Get close enough to make contact. That will engage the spring-loaded needle embedded within it. Brooks: And what's in the needle? A protein enzyme. Harmless for humans. Deadly for her. How long does it take? Instantaneous. Good luck. Justin: The exit's this way. [ Door opens ] Then a 200-yard hike to the boat, and we'll be free. You sure you want to do this? Hey, as soon as she gets what she wants, she will kill us both. There's no reason to stay. I just didn't think you were capable of independent thought, to be honest. My whole life's been about following my programming. But now it's about something even greater -- following you. [ Chuckling ] Hey, what's wrong? Come on. ♪♪ Ohh. Justin. You really would've done it. Done what? Left with me. Run away together. That's what we're doing. ♪♪ Sorry. I couldn't take any chances. If Helen has you, there's no reason for her to come after me. You understand. Right? Wait. You're leaving me? I already did. [ Gasps ] Helen: It was just a simulation. [ Keyboard clacks, computer beeps ] Rather an elegant one. She's good. Kept you immobile without damaging your new abilities. I-I thought we had a real connection. Oh, Justin. It's okay. [ Chuckles ] She left what was really important. [ Squish ] [ Groans ] ♪♪ [ Indistinct talking in distance ] ♪♪ ♪♪ What is this? ♪♪ ♪♪ It's Piper's code. Jo used this when Piper was sick. Yeah, that's what I thought. It doesn't make sense, though. What do you mean? Oh, come on, Chris. I'm in jail. I can't do anything from here. Jo was supposed to give this to -- to someone, in exchange for a weapon that could stop Helen. Well, clearly, Jo didn't make the trade. Well, if Jo didn't hand this over, what the hell is she doing? ♪♪ How you feeling, kiddo? Better. Where's Jo? Jo is, uh... taking care of some stuff. She's looking for Helen. You don't need to worry about Jo, okay? We need Benny. No. Benny's in jail. He can help us. Jo doesn't believe that, but it's true. Okay. I need you to lay back down and relax. Alex... if we don't help her, she won't come home. Don't say stuff like that. I wouldn't say it if it wasn't true. We have to go get him, Alex.
