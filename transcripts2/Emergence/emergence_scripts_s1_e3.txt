 Previously on "Emergence"... A plane crashed on a beach. I found a kid at the crash site I'm being told wasn't even on the plane. I like the kid. She's sweet, but come on, man. She's bringing danger into our lives. I don't know why these things are happening, and it is scary. You're special. Might be some kind of data storage. I have a story for you. There was a survivor from the plane crash.

 They're gonna keep coming. We could run for the rest of our lives and it wouldn't matter. Some government guy called me and said they needed the wreckage hauled away. You kept the airband radio? Whoever was on this frequency was talking to the plane just before it went down. Hey, I borrowed some of your toothpaste. Geez. I'm sorry. What was that sound? Um... yeah, I'm not really sure. It's being broadcast over a covert radio frequency.

 - So... - This have something to do with the kid? With Piper? Yeah, maybe. It doesn't sound like Morse code. You know what? Send me the file. I have some pattern recognition software. Okay, yeah, I'll send it to you. - Alright. - Thanks. Also, we're almost out of milk. But I can pick some up on the way home. Hey, Alex, um... So, you know, i-it seems like things have... really calmed down around here. What's your criteria? That... nobody's broken in for 24 hours or...? - I mean... - Well... Jo, I haven't got a reasonable explanation on why people are chasing this girl or what's going on or... - Okay. - ...or... or why things move by themselves. So, are you just gonna live here indefinitely? It remains to be seen. I just think that maybe it could be a little bit confusing, you know? - Confusing? - Yeah. Confusing for you? No. 'Cause I'm not confused. Alex, eventually, you're gonna have to go home, right? Morning, Mom. Morning, Dad. - Hey. - Hey. I can make coffee. - I would love that. - Okay. Thank you. Is Piper up? She's supposed to go to work with me today. Um, I think she's still sleeping. Okay. This is so nice. I'll be out by the end of business. - I think that's a great idea. - Okay. Okay, thanks. Hey, Piper, you up? Piper! Open up the door! Open the door! Please! Open up the door! Piper! Hey, you awake? - Something happen? - I-I-I don't know. The... The door... - This door? - It was broken. I couldn't get out. I don't know. Seems okay to me. You think maybe you had a bad dream? Yeah. Yeah, maybe. Oh, you know what? You're warm. You feel okay? Um, I guess. Alright, I'm gonna go get the thermometer, okay? You lay back down. I can still go to work with you today, though, right? Not if you're sick. Another time. Wait. Can you just leave the door a little open, please? Okay. Good? Hey. Morning. Hey. You look nice. Yeah, thanks. Got my thing today. Right. Right, of course. You getting all dressed up for the hot oncologist. Ha! Dr. Reed is married and younger than you, honey. Okay, so I'm seeing a bottle of cologne in front of you, and I just want to advise no. - Do you need something? - No, I'm good. Forget it. Uh, Piper has a little bit of a temperature, - but I'm gonna figure something out. - No, no, don't be crazy. I'll reschedule. - It's not a problem. - Your six-month check-up? Absolutely not. Mnh. How are you feeling about it? Oh. Little sad, maybe. I probably won't see Dr. Reed again, so, you know. I hope so. Good luck. Thanks, sweetie. - Different shirt, though. - What? Just a thought. Hold up. You just told me to get out of the house. I mean, technically, I told you to go to your own house. I didn't sign up for this, Jo. I didn't, alright? I have one kid. Alright? One. I wasn't consulted on extras. I-In the past, you were always able to, you know, work from home whenever Mia was sick. But if that's not the case anymore, then I... I mean, I didn't know... I just didn't... I didn't say that. It's just that I don't know this girl. What am I supposed to do with her all day? I mean, I don't know. Whatever you usually do. I mean, Mia always loved staying home with you. I am really good at sick days. - I know. - Yeah. Okay, thank you so much. I owe you. Really, I appreciate it. - Alright, don't... - See ya. ...don't get all mushy. Come on, honey. Good morning! I come bearing pastries. What are you doing here? A word to the wise, I'm told that the, uh, cider donuts are their specialty. - I'll have one. - No, you... Are you... You don't even know this person. You do. Will you get in the car? Just go... - Get in the car. - Yes, okay. Okay. You don't... And, uh, while I'm here, I thought I'd have a little chat with the, uh, new addition to your family. No. And don't ever do this again. I-I'm sorry. I thought we were, uh, cooperating now. You know, friends helping friends. Wrong. I wrote a very nice story about you both, and in return... I'm gonna let you interrogate a 10-year-old? It's a follow-up profile. Maybe we can help find her real parents. If you have a request to make, then call me or come by my office, okay? Alright. Fine. Let's set a time for me to sit down with her at your office, in your presence, all aboveboard. Happy? No. Why won't you let me talk to her? 'Cause she's traumatized enough, alright? I'm not gonna let you make it worse. I would never do that. What have I got to do to get you to trust me? Have a nice day at work, dear. Oh, go on. Morning. Oh, I am starving. Give me those. What's shakin'? The guy who broke into my house is upstairs. I have to go interview him. A lot of trouble following this kid, Jo. You sound like Alex. He's insisting on staying over at the house. - Hey, Walter. - Hey, Chief. Hmm. Help yourself. No, thank you. I'm in ketosis. Congratulations. Yeah, I'm sorry. Excuse me. Your ex-husband, sleeping over? Yeah. Where? On the couch. Come on. Mm-hmm. Why? I don't know. Just feeling protective, I guess. - You're the one with the gun. - Yeah, I know. Jo, you can't play with him like this. Who's playing? I told him to leave. He's leaving. Just... right after he's done babysitting Piper. This is gonna be so confusing for him. I kno... I said that. I said that exact word. You getting all this, Walter? Uh... I changed my mind. Mm. Mm-hmm. Uh, we're gonna still talk about this. I know. Knock, knock. Oh, wow. This is such a nice room. Really fancy. So much nicer than your last room. Just... Wow. Lucky you. Listen, I want to give you a chance to help yourself. Uh, if you were hired to do a job, which is what I suspect, then you are not my target. It's hard to talk... and I'm real tired, so let's skip to the end, where I tell you no and you... go home. So, I've got this new friend. He's a reporter. Uh, he wrote this article about me and the little girl that you terrified. We got to be famous for a minute. That was super fun. But guess what his next story's gonna be about. You. I know, but hear me out. Here's the angle... So, we arrested you, right, and you have been just so, so helpful to the police, just really very chatty, and in return, you get a reduced sentence from the D.A. and a really, really lovely hospital room. I mean, listen, maybe nobody will care, right? I mean, maybe whoever sent you to clean up their mess is just gonna have a big old change of heart. You can't do this. You are gonna get me killed. No, you are gonna get you killed. - Okay. - Okay. Let's start with your name. Lerner. Ken Lerner. Alright, what were you doing in my house, Mr. Lerner? I was sent to... retrieve a piece of technology. Sent by whom? Richard Kindred. Who is that? Head of Augur Industries? The Fortune 500 tech company? Geez, maybe watch the news once in a while. Why is he stealing things from my house? He's not stealing anything. He is... taking back his... stuff. What about the girl? Is she his "stuff"? I was told I didn't have to bother with her. What do you mean? Why not? Kindred just said that that problem was going to take care of itself. Fever's still up. Whatever you got doesn't want to quit. What's wrong? Can I be here with you? Yeah. Um, it's boring. No, it's not. Feeling better? What's your job? My job? I'm a civil engineer. My specialty is environmental... Mia said that you and Jo are divorced. That's right. We are divorced. Why? Don't you want to watch some cartoons or something like that? Okay. Um... Draw me a picture? Of what? Uh, why don't you draw me a picture of a werewolf fighting a unicorn... on the top of a volcano in outer space? I can do that. Awesome. Thank you. Take your time. You like it here. So do you. Yep. D... R... D... R... 5... Z... B... Z... 3... U... What are you doing? - Reading. - What are you reading? That. You can understand this? Yep. How? I don't know. Do it again. D... R... 5... Z... B... Z... 3... U. Do you know what it means? Nope. Do you? No. But I can tell you one thing... it's very helpful, Piper. Thank you very much. You can tell Jo you were the one who figured it out. Why would I do that? 'Cause that will make her happy. And that will make you happy. Medicine time. Kid, we're almost out of medicine. Why don't you, uh... get your coat. Come on. We're going on a field trip. Ah. Chief Evans. I was expecting Postmates. Inside. Well... you seem well. I arrested the man who broke into my house. W-Well, that's... good? Guess who he works for. How would I know? Richard Kindred. Ah. Yeah. That's right. And what do I find when I look him up? What's the first thing I find? Um... my article? Don't you tell me that this is a coincidence. Okay. It's not. What are you really doing here? Huh? Are you working for Kindred? I investigated Kindred for about a year. That little puff piece funded six months of that. It was my way in. But no one would go on the record, and no one would give me access, so... here I am on Long Island. Doing what, exactly? Why won't you let me talk to the girl? She's different, isn't she? She can do things other people can't do, things that she shouldn't be able to do. Augur Industries are known for very expensive medical research, and that's what I'd started to hear about... rumors that Kindred had begun a division using humans as test subjects. What kind of tests? Ones that might allow a young girl to miraculously survive a plane crash, a plane that I believe... belonged to Kindred. But look, I don't have any proof, and I don't want to put you in jeopardy. This is a very, very bad man who will do anything to protect his interests. We have that card, right? And that... the storage disc that was inside of it? That would link him to the people that tried to kidnap Piper. Yeah, but he's never going to admit it, and he's the only one who can access it. He's not just gonna plug it in for us. I want to talk to him. Can you get me his schedule? Mr. Kindred? I'm Jo Evans. I'm the Chief of Police down in Southold. If I could just have a minute of your time... Mr. Kindred is on a very tight schedule, but if you call his office, I'm sure you can make an appointment. You wanna maybe take your hand off me? Sorry. Yes. - So sorry. - That's alright. It's just that I found something that belongs to Mr. Kindred, and I thought maybe he might want it back. Excuse me. Who did you say you were? Jo Evans, Police Chief from Southold. I think I've got wine from Southold. You know what? I bet you do. Um, is this yours, by any chance? I'm not sure. Where was it found? Car cash couple nights ago. Double fatality. Pretty gruesome. Mm. It's possible. We have a lot of products in development. Oh, sure. Yeah. I get that. You guys are pretty busy, I bet. Why don't you leave it with me? I'll be happy to have my team take a look at it. You know what? I would so appreciate that. I mean, we sure couldn't figure out what the heck it was, so... Thanks so much for your time. - Of course. - Yeah. Southold! - Where is it? - What's that, now? What did you do with it? Oh, gosh, is something... missing, Mr. Kindred? Guess that does belong to you after all, huh? Mystery solved. Do you know what I do with people who steal my property? I do not, but I would love to hear all about that. What was in there, anyway, huh? Must have been pretty important. Oh, okay. Well, listen, it was so, so nice to meet you. I will, uh, definitely reach out if we find any more of your property. Oh, and hey! I really like your office. Emily! Now. Alright. Grab yourself some snacks. I'll pick up the medicine. I myself am partial to grape because cherry tastes like garbage, but hey, whatever you want. Grape sounds good. Correct answer. Piper? Piper! Piper! Piper! Sweetie! Call 911. Hey. What happened? Ah, she's okay. Abby thinks it was a seizure brought on by the fever. They want to keep her overnight for observation. Sorry I made you leave work. Oh, that's okay. Your dad's gonna pick up Mia and bring her over. Great. Oh, uh, sorry, she has volleyball. Okay. I'll call him and tell him. Okay. Thank you. Been having flashbacks of Mia's appendix. Oh, God. So fun, right? So fun. Gave me a heart attack then, too. Sorry. Just get better. - Thank you. - Mm-hmm. Paging Dr. Stateman. Dr. Stateman, please. Well, I heard you got to take a ride in an ambulance. Sounds like fun. I don't remember it. Oh. That's too bad. I had a bad dream again. What was this one about? I-It was like everything was... disappearing, a-and it was chasing me. That does sound scary. You know what? I want to go talk to Abby about this real quick. - I'll be... - Wait, don't go. Okay. I-I just... I don't want anything bad to happen to you. Nothing bad is gonna happen to me, okay? I promise I'm not gonna disappear. I'm just gonna be right out there. Hallucinations can sometimes be associated with seizures. So, you're not worried? I'll feel better when we knock this fever down. But you're not worried? I don't know. The problem is, we don't have a medical history. I have no idea what she's been exposed to, if she has a seizure disorder, and I don't know why she's not responding to fever medication. What the hell is 2 MG CU BID? It's a prescription. Two milligrams of copper. B-I-D means twice a day. Who sent that? I have no idea. Paging Dr. Bender. There's no answer. Why is someone sending you random prescriptions? Maybe it's not random. What do you think it would do to her? To Piper? Are you asking me to prescribe based on a mystery text? I'm asking if you think that it would help. Hypothetically. Okay, what... aren't you telling me? I think there's a chance that she might have been a test subject. - What kind of tests? - I don't know. Aah. Hey! Hey! Jo, I can't do this. Would it hurt her, though, Abby? I have no reason to believe it would make any difference. But no. It wouldn't hurt her. Paging Dr. Stateman. Dr. Stateman, please. I'll try it for you. - Thank you. - But I need to know what they did to her. I cannot treat her blind. Okay. Let me see if I can get you a quick answer, okay? Mm-hmm. Okay. - Help me! - What's the matter? They're killing me. - Wait, who? - Take it out. Take it out. Call a code! Uh, I think it was something with the... the morphine? What happened? Uh... I don't know. He said... they were trying to kill him. So, the nurse said the morphine infuser malfunctioned. It's got Bluetooth ability. Meaning it could be hacked, like when they nuked the medical records? I-I confiscated the infuser, so I'll get it to Computer Crimes. We'll find the medical director. If their equipment's been compromised, then Piper and every other patient is in danger. They need to get on the analog equipment right now. Yeah, will do. Um... also, I asked Daphne to look into your mystery texts. - And? - Mobile company says it has no record of it. According to them, it didn't happen. What is it? Some good news for a change. - Wow. - Hey. Look at you. I'm feeling better. Yeah, I can tell. You skipped your game? Of course. Piper's in the hospital. This is so much more important. What did Dr. Reed have to say? Oh, well, there's a big problem. Turns out I'm a little too healthy. Okay. - It's all good. - That's great, Dad. No fever. Yay. Can she go home? Uh, just a few more tests. Okay, so, the copper worked, which, in my professional opinion, is really freaking weird. And I heard about your guy upstairs. Yeah. The accidental morphine overdose that wasn't an accident. Who the hell are these people? I mean, on the one hand, they save a little girl's life, and on the other hand, they murder someone? Yeah, I don't think it's the same person. I mean, killing him was meant to hurt us, but whoever sent these... I think they're trying to help. How'd you fare with Mr. Kindred? I got screamed at and threatened. Sounds like a success. So, Piper is sick, but I think someone at Augur Industries might be trying to help us. Who? I'm not sure. There was one woman who seemed like she wanted to say something. Her name was Emily. Well, I'm gonna need more than that. She works out of their HQ, and she had his ear. You think your contact might be able to ID her? I can try. No promises. - Okay, can you hear me, Piper? - Yep. Like I said, it gets super loud in there, so I need you to stay really still until we're done. Okay. I got Jo in here with me. You... I don't... Okay. Hey! Y-You're doing... You're doing great in there. I-It turns out microphones give me stage fright. Don't... Don't make her laugh. You'll ruin the scan. Okay, we're ready. Piper, I need you to be really still. I need to get out. Hey, Piper, you're okay. You're alright, okay? I need help! Pull her out! Pull her out! Piper! Abby, is she okay? - Abby... - Get her out of here. Abby. Abby! I found Emily. Hey, how's Piper? Um... not great, actually. What happened? I don't know. She had some... some kind of episode in the MRI. Abby thinks we're running out of options, but I... I don't know. I don't know what it means. What can I do? Um, well, there's someone who might be able to help her, but I have to go find them. Um... Do you think you can just come and sit with her? I just... If she wakes up, I don't want her to be afraid. Absolutely. I'm leaving now. I'm on my way, okay? Thanks. That just... It just means a lot. Emily. Do you remember me? I got your texts. The copper isn't working anymore. She's really sick. I need to know what they did to her. You work with some very dangerous people, but you're not them. You contacted her because you care. I'm... I'm sorry. I-I-I have no idea what you're talking about. I saw you today. You wanted to say something. This is your chance. This... This might be your only chance. Look, I... I really think that you have me confused with someone else. I can protect you if... I don't need protection. Uh, I'm sorry, but I-I didn't text you. You can go through, uh, my whole phone if you want. See? Do you believe me now? - Any luck? - Not much. A corporation called Deep Kinetic purchased the property about three years ago. I can't find a single thing about them. Are you sure this is the place? It's been an hour. This is the address Emily sent. She'll be here. So... Piper's pretty sick, huh? Yeah. Unfortunate. No, you'll find another story. I'm sorry she's suffering because of what they did to her. Wait. That's her, right? Yeah, I think so. What are you doing? The way to help her is inside this building. Which is what, exactly? It's an off-the-books Augur site. For Kindred's special projects. Okay, define "special." No. No time. - What are we doing here? - Getting the cure. The entire building is automated. You're looking for locker C-255. We're looking for it? Where will you be? This is as far as I go. - What? - This is as far as I go! I shouldn't even be doing this. I'm initiating a software update. Every piece of machinery will be down, and once you're inside, you'll have five minutes. Emily, I'm law enforcement. I can't break into a building. In about two hours, organ failure begins. She'll stop speaking and hearing in about three. And then she'll stop breathing. How do you know that? I've seen it. You know, I could do this alone. You get caught, you lose your job. I get caught, I get promoted. Well, I'm in it now. You still don't trust me? I don't trust her. Well, that's a problem. That's a bigger problem. Whew. Listen, we need to split up, okay? We're looking for C-255. Okay. Four minutes. Go. Benny. Benny. Is there a release button? There's nothing. Do you have it? Okay, step back. Just go. Um, I'm fine. Just go. Yeah. Or that. Well done. Yeah. Come on. What is that? Go, go, go. Go, go. Go! Jo, this door's not opening. I said five minutes. Robot dogs? You didn't think maybe that was important to mention? - Quiet. - What are you doing? What... What is that? It's an exabyte disk. So, that's what it is. That's a billion gigs. I thought we were getting a cure. Please stop talking. I need to concentrate. Piper is sick, okay? She... She needs medicine. Shh! Okay, we don't have much time. The dock is here, inner wrist. Finding the exact spot can be tricky, but you'll know it when you've got it. Upload will begin automatically. You have to do this right away. Do what? She needs this. That is a disk! It's her. The disk is her. Go on! Take it! Yeah, no, that makes total sense. Absolutely. - You don't believe me? - That Piper is, what, a robot? Is that what you're saying? No. No, okay? I don't believe you. I do. That doesn't surprise me even a little bit. I'm done. I don't care what you do. - Eh... - Are you seri... Don't ever contact me again. Is she... - Jo, hey... - No, I don't want to hear it from you. She conned us... so, what, so we could steal her a laptop? She's still conning you. Well, maybe. But look... would it hurt to try? This is a really great profile of Chrissy Teigen. I feel like we could be friends with her. Jo's back. And it looks like Abby is giving her bad news, so... you should probably wake up and tell her she's wrong. - Hey. - Hey. You know, for what it's worth... I think she's gonna be fine. You do? Yeah. I don't know why. It's just a feeling, but, um... that's a really special kid. Can you get me a cup of coffee? Absolutely. Thanks. Hello. Hi. What happened? You were sick. But you're better now. Can we go home? Yeah. Well, then, how about something scary? Yeah, I'd do that. - Yeah? - Yeah. Mnh. I don't think I like scary movies. You okay? Yeah. I'm fine. I-I just feel like I'm... kind of underwater. Uh, you're not gonna... stick around for movie night? Uh... Eh... Uh, no. Um, you were right. It's best I go home. Yeah. No, I... Makes sense. I never got a chance to tell you... but this right here is the code your radio frequency was transmitting. You cracked it. I didn't. Piper did. I don't know what it means yet, but it's a start. I told you that kid was special.
