 Previously on "Emergence"... Benny: Jo will never understand you. Because she's not like you. Mia: Do you think you'll find her? Most of the time, people don't just disappear. Piper, don't be afraid. There was this crate being loaded onto a boat. Chris: What is it? I don't know. You left your phone on the boat? And if that boat docks before my battery dies...

 We find the boat! [ Horn blares, tires screech ] Jo: 15 years. It's how long Splinter's been active. Could be anybody. Brooks: What the hell is that? Piper had one. Let's just go home. I have to stay. Tell Mia I'm not afraid. [ Doors squeak ] Piper! Okay, you guys. Big adventure. First time on a plane. I'll call you when we get there.

 [ Engine starts ] Good morning. Hello. You have a lovely family. Thank you. Has something happened? In a sense. We're nearly finished. Finished...? With our mission. That's good news. I am so glad to hear you say that. Frankly, I've worried about you. Why? Well, you've...built this life for yourself, and now you're giving it up. Are you really willing to do that? Whether or not I'm willing is irrelevant. It's our purpose. And if someone came to you right now and said that you didn't have to fulfill your purpose, what would you do? Even if I wanted to stay, I couldn't. This is what we were made to do. And I accept that. Well, I appreciate that. And I know that you appreciate that I have to do everything in my power to ensure that we all do our part for the mission. [ Squish ] But I do thank you for your service. [ Thud ] [ Engine shuts off ] [ Sighs ] [ Thunder rumbles ] Hey. [ Gasps ] Sorry. We're here. Yeah, I'm up. [ Groans softly ] Made good time. I don't know what I'm gonna tell Mia. [ Sighs ] Tell her the truth. Piper's alive, and we're not gonna stop until we bring her home. I'm sure your boss will have something to say about that. I'll figure something out. [ Sighs ] [ Thunder rumbles ] I'm sorry. If I'd been able to get to you faster ‐‐ No. Wouldn't have mattered. [ Sighs ] She didn't want to go. She sent you a message. She wanted to be found. What changed her mind? I think they changed it for her. [ Vehicle approaches ] Let's see if we can find a way to change it back. Did you find her? We saw her, but she's still out there. But...there might be a way you can help. Anything. I mean, you're...gonna want to see what it is before you say yes. [ Trunk lid closes ] Jo? Abby, it's not what it looks like. You're driving around a dead guy? Technically, no. That guy's real dead. Not actually a guy. He's...like Piper. Open it. ?You sure? Positive. [ Exhales sharply ] How many others are out there? Good question. Benny. [ Sighs ] I should've let him bleed out. Yeah. So, what the hell do you want me to do, resurrect him? No way. Get the jumper cables. I need you to take him apart. I need to know how it all works. This is our only chance to see the mechanics of everything. And maybe, it will help figure out a way to bring Piper back. You want me to do an AI autopsy? Yeah. That. Alright. We need to get him in the morgue. There's a delivery entrance in the back. Abby, thank you. Yeah, yeah. [ Car door opens ] Follow me. [ Keys jingle ] [ Sighs ] [ Sighs ] You didn't get her? No. Want to talk about it? No. Want me to leave? No. [ Sighs ] [ Birds chirping ] [ Sighs ] So, you saw her? Yes. Mm? She seemed okay. Unhurt. But you couldn't get her? I really tried. And I am gonna keep trying. Did she say anything? Uh... She was worried about... ...people getting hurt. And she said to tell you she's not afraid. Grandpa. She got it. Got what? Uh... well, we, uh ‐‐ we did an experiment. We tried to send her a message through the ham radio. What? Yeah, and that was what I said, Mom. I told her not to be afraid. Guys, I don't think that's what this means. And we got a message back. I never would've believed it if I hadn't seen it myself, Jo. That's binary code. Do you know what it says? No. There aren't any breaks in it. And I couldn't even tell you what programming language it's in. Mom... this is her. We need to find out what it says. Yeah. Okay. Send this to me. Alright? I'll try. [ Paper rustling ] Hey. I'm gonna take off. Oh, okay. Um, thank you for ‐‐ you know, for staying. It's no problem. Um, and, um... ...last night, that was... I should not have done that. It's fine. Come on. It was weird. Your bed. Okay, well, uh... you know, sorry. Yeah. Alright, look, I'm not really here for an apology. I'm actually here so you can tell me what it is you're not telling them. I am not telling them that... the reason Piper didn't come home with me is 'cause she didn't want to. I thought that that might be hard for them to hear. They did something to her. They changed her. Yeah. I mean, probably. I don't know. What are you gonna do? [ Sighs ] I don't know. [ Chuckles lightly ] None of this makes any sense to me. I... Why'd she contact us if she didn't want us to find her? Twice. She contacted you twice, if that code Mia got means anything. I don't even know if that's real. We just have to decipher it. That's all. [ Clears throat ] Yeah, is that your, um, opinion as an officer of the law? Ha. [ Chuckles ] You spoke to Chris. Of course I spoke to Chris, Alex. What are you doing? I was consulting. [ Chuckles ] Okay. Sure. Well...let's just ‐‐ everybody stay in their lane, okay, now that I'm back. Yeah, okay. I just have one... No. ...tiny ‐‐ one more thing. Just ‐‐ No. No. Zero more things, okay? Right. Mm‐hmm. You're gonna get hurt. Fine. You want me to work on the code? No. I think I know someone who can crack it. This isn't my lawyer's office. Nope. Something a little more interesting. No. No. Whatever you want, no. You don't know what I want. You already won. Piper picked you. There's nothing that I can do to her anymore. Where did you get that? From another AI. He's dead now. And he's been around for 15 years, which means you didn't build him. Somebody else is in your game. Don't you want to know who it is? When do we start? Well, aside from the massive trauma from getting hit by a car, no anomalies. Everything's where it's supposed to be. I've removed all his organs. Gonna take a closer look at those. What'd you sew him back up for? I don't know. I thought it'd be nice. Everyone would be more comfortable not staring into a gaping chest cavity. I wouldn't mind. She's special. Who do you think built him? No idea. 15 years ago, I didn't think anyone was capable of this. Can't explain it. But can you explain why this guy seems human, inside and out? Blood, fat, muscle, bone. Scans don't show anything else. Because you're scanning him with machines that are calibrated for humans. So if I recalibrate, I'll find what? No idea. Let's open him back up. Oh, come ‐‐ You know what? We're gonna go back. Hope you enjoyed your furlough. Wait, you ‐‐ you said you had some code that you wanted me to look at. [ Sighs ] [ Cellphone beeps ] Binary. Yeah, we know, but we can't figure it out without knowing the operating language. Well, I can if I have the right computer. Please. That's all I've got, Emily. We do have a supercomputer ‐‐ right here. Man: Yeah, I'll keep you posted on that. Hey. Where's Chris? Uh, no. No. Y‐You have to leave. What? Why? The Chief said so. Okay? Very clear instructions. She's not my boss. I feel like she is. How's it going with the phone‐tracking thing? Mm. Um, the boat got about three miles off the coast, and then the signal was lost, so there's nothing for you to do here anyway. Well, I brought in some outside assistance. Please Please don't do that. He's already here. Look. See? Alex! Hey! Hey! How you doing, buddy? Good to see you. Good. Thanks for doing this. Uh, Chris Minetto, this is Francis Baker. Francis and I were roommates in grad school. Yeah, and lab partners and I was his best man. Okay. And he works at a firm that handles government contracts. Cutting‐edge stuff. Experimental stuff. Ah, it's also some boring stuff. Might have a thing or two to say about what we saw. So, you're looking at a report on a project we worked on for the DOD. They wanted a hybrid metal that would maintain a strong magnetic field but also remain liquid at room temperature. For what? Well, we weren't told. But it doesn't matter anyway. After three years of research, we realized it was financially infeasible and incredibly dangerous. You'd need alkali metals in the mix. Which means a whole mess of explosive chemical reactions waiting to go off. To somehow keep it liquid and stable, the energy requirements would be insane. How insane? Enough to power all of Long Island times like 1,000. The power draw. That's how we find them. It's like looking for ?a grow house. Uh, Francis, thank you so much. Nice to meet you. And both you guys got to get out of here, like, right now. This, uh... must be really hard on you. What's that? Needing my help. So easy, actually. I know I made some mistakes in the past. Mis? [ Chuckles ] Those weren't mistakes, Emily. You tried to kill her, and it just didn't work. Piper chose you... because she's better off with you. I accept that. Ha. Got it. What's it say? It's an invitation. She wants to talk to you. Well, where is she? I don't know where her physical body is. But I don't have to. She's opened the back door. I can get you in her head. How? [ Sighs ] Well, I don't have any of my gear. [ Clicks tongue ] Got the processor in Chuck here, but not the interface. [ Clicks tongue ] We're gonna have to improvise. What does that mean? Possibly sticking something in your brain. I don't know yet. Dr. Frasier? Okay, we got frozen ravioli... frozen pizza... I'm not hungry. Me neither. You know... [ Sighs ] ...maybe we could find someplace else to stay. Someplace that's... a little bit more comfortable for you. It's fine. You're being very brave, Piper. You're sad. Am I? I can tell. Because you lied to Jo. She was your friend. And you hurt her. And that hurts you. I do regret that, Piper, yeah. Doesn't matter. It's not as important as what we're meant to do. You want to take me back home, don't you? What makes you say that? I can tell. Did you find something to eat? Uh, no, we ...? we weren't hungry at the moment. Why don't you bring the car around? Yeah. What were you two talking about? Being sad. It's okay to feel sad. When we feel something, it serves a purpose. To get closer to people. Connect. Understand them better. Be more like them. Is that different from real feelings? It's different because it doesn't control us. You're very special, Piper. You can do things nobody else can do. Not even me. I wish I had your gifts. Maybe one day, you'll share them with me. I'd like that. The things I can do ... will it help with our mission? Very much. In fact, we can't do it without you. What is our mission? You know, you're almost ready to find out, but it may be dangerous. It may be frightening. I'm not afraid. Then I think you're ready. You're talking brain surgery ... invasive brain surgery. That's not happening. Emily: Minor surgery with a tiny, tiny needle, like, so tiny, the width of a hair. We would have to drill a hole into her skull. That does seem like a lot. [ Door opens ] [ Sighs ] Got as much as I could out of evidence. Was not easy. Gonna have to get it back in a f‐‐ Holy... Okay, well, you got the headset, so never mind. Great timing. I still think an electrode in your brain would be more efficient. Uh... That wasn't gonna happen. That...probably wasn't gonna happen. Okay, so, Wilkis set up this whole book construct I piggybacked. You're looking for the gold book. Go. [ Computer beeps ] Emily, what the hell are you talking about? [ Sighs ] The world you'll see in there, it's a digital manifestation of Piper's thoughts and memories organized into different books, books that can be rewritten or destroyed. So, what's inside the gold book? That's where I put all of Piper's thoughts since the day that she was taken. Destroy the book, and the past month never happened. You know, you're being very helpful, Emily ‐‐ uncharacteristically helpful. I'm not helping you. I'm helping her. But she wouldn't remember anything since she was taken. Whatever they did to her, this will undo it. She'll be just like she was the day that they took her. [ Keyboard clacking ] That seems wrong. No. Don't even have some kind of moral problem with all of this. We are fixing what they broke. If you want to get her back, this is how you do it. Piper: Jo? It worked. Hey. I made this place. Do you like it? Yeah, it... is really interesting. Uh... I kind of like our real house, though. I miss you. Yeah, me, too. But I can't go home. Okay, Piper, do you remember when Emily tried to take you and she ‐‐ she changed you? That was different. No, honey, it wasn't. They think I'm helping them. But I'm just pretending. Why? I'm going to fix Benny. No. Piper, you can't fix Benny. I can. He doesn't want to do bad things. But his mind is telling him to. You know what? I don't care about Benny. I just care about you. But I think I could teach him to do things the way I do. And then I can teach all of them. You know what? We are just gonna ... We'll talk about this ano‐‐ another time. Okay, for right now, I am gonna get rid of this, alright? And then ... And then you and I are gonna figure out how to get you home. When you found me, you didn't leave. I can't leave them. Jo? Were you really gonna do that? Piper. To me? [ Rapid beeping ] What just happened? I don't know. I think she kicked us out. Put me back in. Shut up. I'm working on it. It's okay, okay. You can try again. That was a mistake. I shouldn't have ... Brooks: You had to ... Emily, can you do this or not? No. She locked us out. Okay, so, let me see if I can summarize. You're not working, you adopt a kid with your ex ?wife... Hold up. No ...? Nobody adopted anyone. ...and you're consulting for the police department run by your ex ?wife? We had a one ?time deal. What are you doing? I'm fine. ?It's fine. But are you happy? Seems like you're waiting for something that's never gonna happen. Life moved on, and I'm not sure you have. Francis, I am good. I'm figuring it out. Maybe this will help. Come work with me. [ Chuckles ] We're opening a branch in D. C. I want you to head it up. You'd have your own team. We'd cover any commuting costs. You could come home every weekend if you wanted to. Your schedule would be as flexible as you need it to be. That's a lot of zeroes. [ Both chuckle ] It's a crazy time for me right now. For everyone. Well... that's not a "No." Think about it, huh? Alright. This is underexposed. I adjusted the kVp and the contrast. Is that another one? Emily: Looks like. Right in the prefrontal cortex. Do you have a cranial saw? [ Gasps ] Hold on. [ Door opens, closes ] It's like she's... planning some kind of coup. S‐She wants to teach Benny how to rewrite his own code. The guy who kidnapped her? Yeah. She wants to help him. All of them. It's your fault, you know. What are you talking about? She's being you. What would Police Chief Jo Evans do if she thought people needed help? She'd risk her life to save them. I mean, it doesn't matter anyway. They're all as smart as she is. They're gonna figure out what she's trying to do. Then we need to find her. I'll get Emily back to lockup, then check in, see if there's any new chatter. Wait. You're right. They're all built on the same basic code. When you were in her head, Charlie was connected to her. I think I can trace it back to where. Emily... can you find her? Yes. Maybe. At least... somewhere close. What's that for? It's for you to hide under. Just for a little bit. You're gonna need to be really quiet. Okay? What are we doing? You'll see when we get there. Under the blanket now. [ Seat belt clicks ] [ Engine idling ] [ Brakes squeak ] [ Window whirring ] Guard: I. D. and clearance authorization. Benny: Sure. Her, too. [ Radio chatter ] Thank you, Doctor. Just need to search your vehicle, and you're all set. Of course. All clear. Loading bay. Four minutes. [ Car door closes ] This is why we need you. You understand? [ Electricity crackling ] When you opened that, can you tell me what it felt like? I don't know. I just did it. I had no idea she can ‐‐ It's incredible. Everything in here? Yeah. [ Sighs ] If she can do all of that, I mean, maybe we all ...? [ Squish ] [ Grunting ] [ Screams ] Why did you kill him?! I didn't kill him, Piper. You did. I know you think you can change them. Help them. Help Benny. But you can't. You don't want to share your gifts with me. What you want doesn't matter. Of course, you have a choice. You can give me what I want... or I can take it. [ Gasps, groans ] [ Metal creaking ] [ Electricity crackling ] [ Click, alarm blaring ] Benny: What happened? Where's Helen? She said leave her! We have to go now! Damn it. [ Tires squeal ] Okay, so, I pulled basically the last favor I got. A dozen agents are canvassing the area where Emily said Piper would be. I'll head out there, too, but it's like half of Monmouth County. It's gonna take days. [ Sighs ] Wish I could help more, but I'm hanging by a thread as it is. If I don't get Emily back in lockup immediately, they will cut me loose. Hey, listen, don't get fired over this. You've already gone way above and beyond. Already getting rid of me. Cannot stand the competition. I just don't want to drag you down with me. I'm not worried. If I get fired, you're gonna have to hire me. Just be careful. You, too. Alex: Hey. Alex. Hey. What are you doing here? Oh, I'm just...working on some stuff with Chris. No. Alex, you ... I already told you you don't have any work here. I'll catch up to you after I hand off Emily. Okay. Hey. This has got to stop. Absolutely, yep. This is the last time. I promise. But you're gonna want to see this. So, I've tracked about 50 places in the country using that much power ... mostly manufacturing, but I flagged all the weird ones. Hold on. Okay, um, so I think this one is an illegal logging operation. Um, this one's probably a grow house. This one's definitely a grow house. I ...? Hold on. That's Monmouth County. Uh...yeah. It's a restaurant by the pier. And it was using a ton of power up until two days ago. When we found that thing on the boat. Then that's where we're going. Now. Not you. [ Engine shuts off ] Female voice: Leave a message. [ Beep ] We're here. Call when you make it out. [ Sighs ] I don't think Helen's going to call you back. Why's that? Because I trapped her in there. She killed the man who was helping us. So I piled a bunch of stuff on her. I can help you. To be like me. What are you talking about? I know you don't want to hurt people. You just have to look for the real you. Inside. And ask him what he wants. You're a very special girl. And you know what? You're right. There's a really big part of me that would love to be just like you. But I can't listen to that part. Benny! I'm sorry, Piper. Please! I need you to get in the trunk. No! Come on. Benny! Get in. No! [ Tires squeal ] Benny! [ Breathing heavily ] [ Vehicle approaches ] [ Vehicle doors open, close ] [ Pounding ] Help! Help! [ Pounding continues ] [ Metal creaks ] Jo! Piper. Come here. I got you. Come here. It's okay. I was wrong! It's okay. We're gonna get you out of here right now, okay? Hello, Jo. [ Gun cocks ] Okay. [ Gun clatters ] Piper. Run. I'm not leaving. Easy. Okay. I'm not alone. Chris is here. Good. A reunion. There's no way out of this for you, Benny. Just let her go. You don't want to do this, Benny. I have to, Piper! [ Gasps ] Benny. [ Breathing shakily ] Benny. You did it. Put the gun down! Put it down now! [ Both grunt ] J...?Jo, I ... I'm sorry. [ Clank ] [ Grunts ] [ Groans ] [ Metal clanks ] "I wanna pick you up and scoop you out  Piper! Alex: Glad you're home, kiddo. [ Door closes ] " Paint me in trust, I'll be your best friend  "Call me the one, this night just can't end  You did it. Well, with your help. Am I deputizing you now? Eh...no. [ Chuckles ] You should, though. I'm really good at it. [ Chuckles ] You hungry? Uh, yeah. Just give me a second. Okay. Ice cream? " We're just human".  You don't quit. [ Chuckling ] Just catching up. You want a beer? No. I'm ‐‐ I'm gonna go. Okay. Girls have finally settled down. [ Chuckles ] Where's Benny? Oh, Chris took him to the E. R. to get his jaw checked out. But we got him. What happened to his jaw? I hit it with a crowbar. Oh. Well... that's the only reasonable response. I think so. Sure you don't want to hang out and have a drink? No, thanks. [ Chuckling ] Okay. Everything alright? Yeah. Yeah, everything's fine. It's just been a big day. Tired. Yeah, I bet. Yeah. Alright, good night. Good night. [ Chuckles ] Hey. Um... Francis offered me a job. A really good job. That's great. In D. C. Oh. With the salary he offered, I can... keep my condo here and come home on the weekends to see Mia. Um... That's a... a big change. Nothing's decided yet. But now that Piper's back, got to start thinking about what's next for me, you know? Francis said that ... [ Chuckles ] He said that it seems like everyone's moved on with their lives, but not me. [ Chuckles ] I mean, that's not true, Alex. No, no, it's true. It's totally true. [ Inhales deeply ] But job or no job, ... , uh... [ Chuckles ] I just can't keep doing this to myself, you know? I could blow up your whole life. You know? Oh, yeah? You took me out under false pretenses, forced me to cooperate with an unsanctioned investigation. Nobody forced you to do anything, Emily. You had me digging around in a dead body that you smuggled over state lines in your trunk. What do you think they'll say about that? I know exactly what they'll say. "Lights out at 10:00, breakfast at 5:00. See you in 15 to 20." Maybe. Or maybe they'll start asking about what you've really been up to. Why you've been spending so much time with a police chief in some Podunk town. Why have you been spending so much time with her, staring into her pretty blue eyes? [ Engine clunks, shuts off ] What happened? It's them. It's them. Quiet. Quiet. It's them. It's them. Just let me up there. I'll ...? I can reboot the computer. Brooks! Damn it. 30 seconds. Go! Phone. [ Shotgun cocks ] [ Shotgun cocks ] What's the story? Almost there. Leave it. No, I just need ‐‐ Emily! [ Vehicle approaches ] Run. [ Tires screech ] [ Shotgun cocks ] Brooks: FBI! Drop your weapons! [ Gunshots ] [ Brooks groans ]
