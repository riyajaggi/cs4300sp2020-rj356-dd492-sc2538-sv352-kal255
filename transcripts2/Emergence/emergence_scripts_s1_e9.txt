 Previously on "Emergence"... Cancer's back. We did this before. We can do it again. Not this time, honey. Telling an AI it's an AI effectively destroys the program. Wouldn't that be like killing her? Better her than us. Ryan Brooks. I'm with the FBI. Everything they're investigating leads to Piper. You wanted to get to Emily first. Why?

So when she was at the hospital, it wasn't anything we did that saved her. No, it was something like that. What is this? [ Sighs ] An exabyte disc, I'm told. There's no such thing. Must've come from Emily. Why? Uh, they told me that if she knew, if Piper found out what she was that it would destroy the... program. It would kill her, essentially. But it didn't. Why not? I think because... Piper made it not happen. I always wondered what we'd do when her real family showed up. Just figured there would be somebody out there who'd come get her. That's never gonna happen now, is it? No, Dad, it's not. So what do we do? [ Door opens ] I can see you all whispering in here. Piper and I talked. Nothing's different. So you guys have to get your heads straight starting now. Got it? [ Clears throat ] Yeah, hon. Got it. Good. Piper's tired. We're going to bed.

You knew. Yeah. But you didn't tell me. I couldn't, because -- I know why. I'm sorry. I-It's alright. I didn't tell you something, too. Okay. [ Sighs ] When I first got here, I took a sharp knife and I cut something out of my neck. What? Oh, my... What was it? I don't know. But it was telling me to leave here, and I didn't want to. Okay. Well... Is there anything else talking to you? No. Not right now. Not right now. Okay. Um... Moving forward, no cutting things out of your body. Okay? Or anyone else's body. In fact, you know what? How about just a general no-knives policy is what we're going for. Okay. Okay. Alright. Uh, come on. Go to bed. Jo? Hmm? Most people would have made me go away. But not you. Nope. Not me. ♪♪ ♪♪ By the time I woke up, it was nighttime. I'm sorry. He could be anywhere by now. You know, Wilkis disappearing might actually do us a favor. Not like the FBI's gonna get out of our lives any time soon. Did you go see a doctor? That's a really long time to be knocked out. Oh, I'm fine. Got a hard head. Wilkis was really unraveling, Jo. He's terrified of Piper. Tried to task me with killing her. Well, Emily already tried that. It didn't work. Somehow, Piper was able to overcome the fatal exception error. How? [ Knock on door ] So. Weirdos in masks. Want to hear about them? So much. I couldn't find anything in our database, but I think your guys might be a cyber terrorist group called Splinter. Okay. This -- This is just a -- a Reddit forum, though. Everything I've found has been anecdotal. Um...people in black masks targeting big tech outfits. But, yeah, blowing up buildings would definitely be a new tactic. You heard of them? Never. They sound like some sort of urban legend to me. I saw them. Even so, they're after Augur. Not you. No. They're after Piper. They have to be. Hey, Chief, uh, Agent Brooks on the horn. Says it's important. I'm unavailable. I'm busy. Just from personal experience, you can't ghost the FBI. Yeah, I know that. But I don't have to make it easy for him, either. Uh, so, what is the plan if Emily spills her guts to him about Piper? I'm working on it. Hey, Doc. Hi. How are you holding up? Oh, just trying to roll with it, you know? How about you? Been going over whatever records I have on Piper. And? And nothing. I mean, vitals are normal, labs are normal. Nothing that would explain whatever it was we saw last night. Ah. What are you doing here? Uh, well, I'm looking for you, actually. What do you know about clinical trials? Now, see. Don't -- Don't get excited. It's just a question, Abby. Fine. Fine. Um, what kind of clinical trials? Well, my doc called and said that she thinks I might qualify for some kind of gene-therapy thing. Well, everything I've read has been really promising. It's worth talking to them. Alright. I'm meeting the rep in a couple minutes, so... Hey! Come on. Don't. Cut that out. I-I can't help it. Just get whatever data they have. I'll look it over. Okay. Between us, right? Oh, yeah, yeah. Thank you. [ Clicks tongue ] ♪♪ [ Sighs ] Mr. Sawyer? Yeah, that's me. Oh, you can call me Ed. It is so good to meet you, Ed. I'm Helen. [ Chuckling ] I mean, this all seems too good to be true. Five years ago, I would've agreed with you. But with all the technological advances we've seen, we're in a new world. [ Sighs ] Okay. What are the side effects? Nothing. No known side effects. Ah. Now I know it's too good to be true. It's not. With chemotherapy, your five-year outcome is... 48%. Yeah. A little less than a coin flip. With this treatment, your outcome jumps to 96%. This is not about delaying death. This is a cure. And I do not use that word lightly. A year from now, it's over. ♪♪ I really want to believe you. You'd be a fool not to. Okay, so, um... say I was interested. Uh, how does my insurance work with all this? I am sure we can come up with a mutually beneficial arrangement. Mia: So, the sum of the interior angles would be 180 times 4, right? Because there are four triangles inside of the polygon. Get it? Yep. No. Hey. Hey. How's it going? I'm trying to teach Piper geometry. Oh. I don't get it. Aren't you supposed to be a computer or something? Can't we just use a calculator? Is my dad not home yet? No. He's not. I'm gonna leave, okay? Yeah. Yeah. Hi. I have to talk to you. Right now. ♪♪ What is it? Okay. I just came from a meeting at the hospital. It was about a clinical trial. Clinical trial? Just listen, okay? They said it was a cure, but the payment was Piper. Hold on. I'm sorry. Uh, what? Start from the beginning. Okay. My doctor, Dr. Reed, said she knew about this study. So she set up a meeting between me and this lady who knew my entire medical history -- It was a woman? Yeah. Yeah, here. Her name was Helen. She gave me that number. That's all I got. I knew it was too good to be true. As soon as she said "cure," I knew it. Chris, I need you to run a number right now. Alex: What the hell do they want with Piper? 212... Well, they said that this wasn't the right place for her. That we wouldn't know how to handle her or some nonsense. And pull all the security footage from the hospital. Okay. Did you call this number? 'Course not. ♪♪ [ Line ringing ] Leave a message. [ Beep ] You just made a mistake. A big mistake. And I am really gonna enjoy making you pay for it. ♪♪ Damn. [ Knock on door ] Hey. Sorry to bug. I'm your neighbor. Right next door. Do you know where the ice maker is? Oh, sure. It's, uh, down that way, I believe? By the, uh, vending machine. That's a cool accent. Thanks. You from England? Uh, Welsh. Close enough. Are you a journalist? I think I've read some of your stuff. Yeah, and you must be a, uh, federal agent. [ Chuckles ] Yeah. Got me. Ryan Brooks. You mind if I come in? Yeah. I do, actually. I'm just, uh, in the middle of working right now. Sure, sure. Yeah, I get it. Uh, seriously, though, I -- your series on augmented reality, super cool. Thanks. Then I read your profile of Richard Kindred. Blowing a little smoke up his butt, but okay. And then I -- I read your article on Chief Jo Evans. Adopting a little orphaned girl. Which I gotta be honest -- kind of threw me. What's the, uh, connection there? No connection. No? No. Just doing a favor for a friend. Trying to locate the little girl's family. That is really nice of you. Really nice. It's -- Um, I've been trying to get ahold of her, but she seems pretty busy, so I thought I'd talk to you. And you're friends. I did not know that. Well, best of luck. What are you working on now? I never like to talk about a story until I've written it, you know? Well, yeah, that seems pretty smart. I totally get it. Must be a pretty great story. [ Cellphone vibrates ] You know, we are gonna have to continue this later. But I'll definitely see you around, neighbor. ♪♪ [ Line ringing ] Leave a message. [ Beeps ] Yes. Uh, my name's Alex Evans. You made an offer to someone I know. I'd like to hear more. Thank you. Is your name Alex? Yeah. That lady's looking for you. [ Indistinct talking on TVs ] Mr. Evans. Have a seat. Alright. Who the hell are you supposed to be? I think you know the answer to that. You know, people usually just call back. You said you wanted to talk. Let's talk. ♪♪ [ Exhales slowly ] ♪♪ So do you really have the cure for cancer? Or is this just a scam? Not a scam. What are you gonna do with her? Why? Because I'm asking. She'll be where she belongs. With us. Right. Yeah, well... I saw that creepy-ass neighborhood she used to live in, and I'm gonna tell you something right now, I wouldn't want a dog I liked living there. That wasn't me. Don't conflate my efforts with those of Augur Industries. She's a one-of-a-kind. And she'll be treated as such. Yeah. She should. You've grown fond of her. She is remarkable. A perfect construction in an imperfect world. Her design was stolen from us. I only want to provide for her a safe environment, surrounded by people more equipped to handle her specific needs. So she doesn't harm herself. Or someone else. [ Sighs ] I don't know what I'm supposed to do next. It's simple. Bring her to me. And save a man's life. ♪♪ Uh, give us a minute. Yes, sir. Thanks. Evening, Ms. Cox. [ Exhales sharply ] Well, I'm gonna be honest. I am confused. 'Cause I'm thinking I'm investigating Richard Kindred's murder, and I'm like, "Great idea. Talk to Kindred's daughter. Prime suspect." Then when I find her -- you -- I also find the Southold Chief of Police. And the whole building explodes. I just lost someone. Someone very important to me. You lost someone? Um, not to split hairs, but you kind of dissolved him into a smoothie. I'm not talking about him. See... [ Sighs ] This is the part I'm having trouble with. 'Cause Kindred's murder and bombing Augur, they seem linked. I just don't know how. And I'm thinking you do. Well, of course they are. The people that blew it up want what my father wanted. What I wanted. They want what everyone wants. And what's that? How much has Chief Evans told you about Piper? Yeah, I guess I'm not surprised. Thanks, Chris. [ Cellphone beeps ] Well, the phone number was Internet-based and can't be traced. And the hospital cameras -- all of them -- inexplicably malfunctioned today. Ah. Ah, two dead ends for the price of one. [ Cellphone vibrating ] [ Sighs ] She's good. Mm. But not as good as you. [ Chuckles ] Thanks, Dad. [ Sighs ] I'm really sorry that they tried to manipulate you that way. Oh, I'm not. She showed her hand. That's a win in my book. Yeah, but I mean... a clinical trial. Oh. [ Chuckles ] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I know. I know. Well, I wasn't gonna commit to anything without getting more information. I'm gonna stay out of it. I just...you know... You're considering other options, that's good. Well, it's not like I was aiming for it, honey. They reached out to me, you know. Still, it did get me thinking. You see something like Piper. Something that just seems completely impossible, that I never would've believed it could happen in a million years... You know, maybe I just don't know how everything is gonna end... maybe. What? I'm just happy. [ Door opens ] Don't be happy. I don't want you to be happy yet. [ Chuckling ] It's too late. No. Don't. [ Door closes ] Hey. [ Chuckles ] [ Exhales sharply ] You were right. It worked hook, line, and sinker. Hey! Alright. Nice job. I'm telling you right now. She bought it. I am a master at espionage. Okay. So how does this happen? What -- What happens next? Um, she said she's gonna text me... Okay. ...a time and a place. She also, um, gave me this. Supposed to put it on her wrist. I don't know what for, but... -Okay. -Hm. [ Cellphone vibrates ] Oh, sorry. Chief Evans. Agent Brooks. Had a productive and, well, bizarre chat with Emily Cox. I was gonna file my official report, but I wanted to give you a chance to see it. Stop by my office tomorrow if you'd like. ♪♪ ♪♪ [ Clears throat ] Chief Evans? Yes. Good morning. I'll take you up to see Agent Brooks. Okay. Thank you. Your firearm will be secure. This way. ♪♪ ♪♪ Chief Evans. Thank you for coming. Have a seat. So you're questioning me now? Just talking. Why don't you sit? Without a lawyer? You must think I'm an idiot. No, thank you. I know you're not an idiot. And if you want to escalate things to the next level, absolutely get a lawyer. That's a great line. I've used that line. [ Voice recorder beeps ] This is Special Agent Ryan Brooks. The time is 8:07. You're wasting your time, Agent Brooks. I have witnesses that can place Alan Wilkis at the Peconic Inn. Staying with your reporter buddy. It's not gonna be hard to connect that to you. Lying to a federal agent gets you five years in Danbury. Am I under arrest? I'd rather not play it that way. Off the record. [ Voice recorder beeps ] Off the record. Where's Alan Wilkis? I don't know. Need a better answer than that. I don't have one. [ Sighs ] I had every intention of handing him over to the FBI. After Emily Cox was off the streets. He escaped. It wasn't your call to make. Richard Kindred was murdered in federal custody. So...I made it my call. Why was Wilkis so important to you? Actually, I already know the answer to that question. It's because of Piper. Emily said Piper is dead. She's mistaken. Okay. She's wrong about that. Let's see if she's wrong about this -- is Piper... not human? Do you believe that? Emily does. And Kindred did. And I think the people who blew up that Augur facility did. They're called Splinter. But you knew that already. Because your name is on every affidavit and every search warrant request looking into Splinter. The FBI's been chasing them for 15 years. How do you know about Splinter? Because I saw them. And because they reached out to my family to make a deal. They cure my father's cancer. And in return, I hand over Piper. They reached out to you. [ Chuckles ] Splinter? Some woman named Helen. [ Sighs ] She believes that my ex-husband is handing over Piper. Tonight. If you're interested, we can make this our own little joint task force. You get the collar. And once this is over, you leave Piper alone. Hold on. Hold on. This is happening in about 12 hours. You're never gonna get this opportunity again. Do we have a deal? Okay, "Remove from package." Come on. There we go. Pairing mode on. Alright, pairing, pairing, pairing, pairing, pairing, pairing, pairing. Alright, "connecting device." Bluetooth pairing unsuccessful. Ugh, come on. Bluetooth pairing unsuccessful. [ Groans ] [ Sighs ] You know, Piper. If I can impart one piece of wisdom to you, it is this -- never buy cheap stuff online. Those people said they could make you better. Who told you that? I heard. Do you have some kind of super hearing, or something? No. Just regular hearing. Oh... Don't you want to get better? Yeah. Sure I do. [ Sighs ] But I would never trade you for that. But -- No. No buts. I didn't even have to think about it. You don't have to think about it, either. Okay? Okay. ♪♪ Maybe I can figure it out. Figure what out? How to make you better. Mm. Yeah, maybe. [ Sighs ] I'll bet you can do a lot of things. I'll start thinking right away. Okay. [ Chuckles ] ♪♪ Okay. [ Sighs ] The good thing about the ferry landing is there's only one way in or out. I'll watch the entrance. Yeah. Brooks and I can cover the parking lot. Yeah, okay. We'll grab her as soon as we see her. She won't get anywhere near you. Okay? Sounds good. Alright, go ahead and clip this on the back of your waistband. Uh, Alex Evans, this is Agent Ryan Brooks. Hey. Um, can you get Agent Brooks hooked up with a two-way? Uh, yeah. His mic still needs to be connected. Okay. This way. I got you. Alright. Has this been in someone else's ear? Um, I don't know. 'Cause if it has, that's so gross and not sanitary at all. Put it in your ear, okay? Yeah. Thank you. Alright. I'm gonna be able to hear you at all times. [ Sighs ] How's this? That's too loose. It's got to be really tight or you're exposed. Okay. [ Thunder rumbles ] Yeah. Okay. Hey. It's okay. I'm not sure this is a good idea anymore. We got to do it. Yeah. But there are other ways. It's not your job to -- I want to do it. It feels good to finally bring the fight to them, you know? It's gonna be good. Okay. Alright. [ Thunder crashes ] ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ Is this thing working? Perfectly. I'm in position, Chief. Here, too.
