 Previously on "Emergence"... What's it been, like, a year for you guys? You have to retrain your brain. This person who was really important in your life isn't supposed to be. But they still are. Francis offered me a job. In D.C. Nothing's decided yet. You know, I'm not crazy about you doing this alone. I'm not going alone anyway. Brooks is going, too. Mm  Jo, it's her.

 My name is Loretta. I made Helen. I built a device that can effectively end Helen. In exchange for Piper's code. My purpose was to collect data. And then at an appointed time, the data would be uploaded. There's a power source, like a very powerful battery that Helen needs to facilitate the upload. She's gonna want this back. Helen isn't like the others. She cannot be stopped with conventional means. I want what Piper has. Piper's abilities are unique.

 I want you to replicate them. As soon as she gets what she wants, she will kill us both. We need Benny. If we don't help her, she won't come home. Brooks? Do you hear that? We gotta get the hell out of here. You see anything to bust this open? Come on. Here. Brooks. Here. Brooks. You want me to try it? Just wait. Oh, my God. We gotta go. Okay. Come on. Southold Dispatch to Marine Zero-One-Zero. Chief, you on the air? Alright, keep trying. Okay. Hey, Chris. Southold Dispatch to Marine Zero-One-Zero. Hey. Hey. What's wrong? Where's Jo? Piper thinks she might be in trouble. Um...they took a boat to Plum Island. They think Helen might be holed up there. And she left me this. Why? Supposed to keep it safe. Can I see that? This is me. Yeah. That's what Benny said. Can I go to the bathroom? Sure. Yeah. Hello, Piper. What are you doing here? I'm just wondering if I'm wrong about you. I don't think I am. You're not wrong. Okay. She took the boat from the Marine Division. They were gonna land on the east side of the island to avoid detection. She said she'd check in, but I haven't heard from them in a couple hours. Don't be mad, Okay. Benny, get back in the cell now. We need him. This is why you guys are here? Little bit. Okay, no. No, I'm not releasing anyone on the word of of a kid. If Helen isn't stopped, then Piper and I are both gone. We'll both be uploaded and nothing can be done to reverse it. Okay. You think she's  Shh! This place is a maze, but I think... if we just keep heading east, then we'll hit an exit eventually. No signal. You? Brooks. Are you bleeding? I am? Yeah. Must've popped a stitch. Come here. Okay. Let me see it. Oh, yeah. I'm sorry. It's fine. We gotta keep moving. Helen got an upgrade. Yeah, from Emily. If she can do this... I'm betting that killshot is useless now. We might've given Loretta Piper's code for nothing. I didn't give her Piper's code. That disk is the one Emily sent when she was trying to kill her. Loretta's not gonna be happy about that. Well, good. We just gotta get out of here and figure out a way off this island  Ooh! Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? Wait What  No. No, no. Ow! Brooks! Aah, aah, aah, aah! Aah! Oh! I got it. I got it. Aah! Mnh! I'm gonna cut it out. Okay. Mnh! Aah! Are you okay? Yeah. We gotta get the hell out of here. Which way? Up this way, to the right. Stop! Get your hands up! Jo, wait! It's not what you think! Hey! Hey! What? It's all good! He's with us! What?! Jo! Jo! We found you! Piper! Okay. Jo! Jo! -Okay, okay, okay. -Okay, come on. Go in there with Agent Brooks. Go! Go, go! Uh... What is this? They used to experiment on animal diseases here. Rumor is they were trying to weaponize anthrax. Still sounds safer than out here, though. Does it? Does it sound safer? Get in. Alright. Somebody better tell me who thought this field trip was a good idea because I'm gonna kill them. We're rescuing you. Look, your boat is back in Southold. A person matching Emily's description was seen disembarking. You would've been trapped here. You're hurt. I'm fine, Piper. So what you thought that maybe bringing a criminal and a kid for backup was a solid plan? Super powered kid. Alex. Where is Helen? Well, let's see. Uh, she's acquired the ability to turn into about a billion nanobots, so she could be literally anywhere. What? We need to get off this island. You have a boat, I assume? Y-Yeah. Yousef's. Docked on the east side of the island. Alright. You stay with me at all times, and whatever I tell you to do, you listen, okay? But not like you normally listen. Actually listening. I'm not afraid. You know what? This time, you need to be. Come on. We can't just run, Jo. I need you to stop talking. Helen can still initiate the upload  Not without this, she can't. That'll just delay her. Give me the weapon. I'll go after her. Are you gonna stop talking, or do I have to make you stop talking? Look, we need to think about this, okay? If this room is really sealed, it might be the only place Helen can't get to us. So what? We just stay here? For how long? I don't know. But if we go out there like this? She's just gonna pick us off. One by one. Hey. I'm home. Hey. Bio homework done. She's gonna make an excellent doctor one day if she wants to be. Great. I mean, I don't know. It seems like a lot of school and a bad work-life balance. Well, what the hell do you know? Where's Piper? Uh... She's, uh...doin' a thing with your mom. What thing? Oh, no, no. I-I wanna know, too. Look, all I know is that Chris asked me to grab that exabyte disk. Supposed to keep it safe. So that's what I'm gonna do, okay? Wait. Why does Piper get to do a work thing, but not me? You know, that is definitely something you should bring up next time they're home. I would be so good at a work thing. Ed! Sawyer. What's up? Hey, I don't suppose your daughter's home, is she? Who are you? Michael Denman. Department of Justice. And these are federal agents. And we have a warrant to search the premises. Let's see it. Sure. You just read all that till your heart's content. Well, your daughter has something that belongs to the federal government. I'm here to retrieve it. Unless you just want to hand it over. Right? Save everybody a lot of pain and heartache. Anyway, you think about it. Okay, boys and girls. Come on in. Excuse me, Ed. Would you rather know when you're gonna die, or how you're gonna die? What? When or how? Um. Neither. Nope. You gotta pick. I, uh  I think when. Because then you can really make plans. Sure. It looks like an auto-injector. What's in it? Something that kills people like you. That's not very nice. I don't know. Some kind of special enzyme. But she doesn't know we have it, so... that's one thing we've got going for us. But if she's made of nanobots, how close do you need to get? Pretty close. Sounds like suicide. Well, so is staying in here forever. It just takes longer. We'll have to find a way to sneak up on her. Oh. Right. That's the plan. Great Great job, FBI. What's your bright idea? Because I'm all ears. Okay. I have... You know what? ...plenty of ideas, first of all! We're definitely not doing this right now. Is something burning? Piper, stay back. I got it! I got it! I got it! I think these wires were tampered with. What? When? Where's Benny? He got it. He got the killshot. I need you to keep this safe and keep them safe. I'm gonna go find him and get it back. Wait  I should go with you  I need you to watch my family, okay? I still think he's going to help. Yeah. I know you do. Stay put. Keep the door locked till I get back. Hey, uh, Chief, I should  I should go with you. Hm? You know, I don't think so, Chris. Look, I-I know you think I made a bad call here  Yeah, you did. But when you're not around, I have to do what I think is best, and that's what I did. I don't think I'm wrong. Alright. We're gonna have to split up. Alright. And if I run into Helen first? Run. Hey, hey, hey. It's okay. It's a nice house on a cop salary. Oh, it's freakin' adorable. Well, Mr. Sawyer, I have to say... you look okay for a cancer guy. Pretty okay. You gonna tell me you have a cure now, too? Nah. Someone does, probably. Not me, though. Sir, we got a gun safe here. Don't suppose you know the combo? Sure don't. You know what would be a real pain for everybody? If the little girl's identity were known to the wider world. Kinda ruin everybody's lives. You're not gonna do that, though. A guy like you wants to be in the shadows. All you want to do is erase things. You won't even put what you're looking for in the warrant. Dr. Abby Frasier. I know you. You guys really don't know what you're up against, do you? Hey, Georgie? Get the drill. Don't move, Benny. You have to go back, Jo. I'm trying to draw her here. Think about your family. Don't talk to me about my family. Where is it? I'm not gonna give it to you. You're gonna have to shoot me. Fine. You were in my house, Benny. We took care of you when you were hurt. How did I not know? I never even suspected that you were lying. I wasn't. Not entirely. How can you say that to me? Because I couldn't kill you, Jo. When I had the chance, I couldn't do it. I have the weapon in my pocket. I'm gonna take it out. I could give this to you, but I'd be condemning you to death. I'd rather not to that. Please. I can get close to her and I can do this. She'll kill us both. I can do this. Please. Just hide. You're not wrong about me. Okay. Whatever happens, don't come out. I'm surprised to see you. Well, you shouldn't be. I heard you'd been arrested. I was. I've convinced them to trust me again. Piper let me out. She's here. With them. That's a problem. But one I can solve. Where are they? They're on the roof. Let's get it over with. Benny. We are so far past this now. Benny. What happened? Are you okay? Oh, my God. Benny! Oh, no! Okay... Um...I... Okay, we need to get out of here. Can you put  Put your arm around me, okay? I'm gonna get you up. We're gonna get out of here. Come on, Benny. Okay. Okay. I'm gonna go get help. I'm gonna  No, Benny. It's okay. Listen. I'm gonna stay right here. I'm gonna stay right here. I'm gonna stay right here, okay? You're okay. Look at me. Hey. It's okay. Chief? We have to go. I can't just leave him here, Chris. Chief, we gotta go now, alright? Okay. How long has it been? Five minutes since the last time you asked, sweetie. We should go find her. Do you really wanna see how mad Jo will be when we open that door? 'Cause I don't. I do not. How long has it been now? Mm. Too long. She's okay. She'll be okay. I work with local PD all the time, and she's better than all of them. You're gonna tell me about my ex now? No. No. Sorry. I just... we don't need to worry about her. Yeah, I'm fully aware. Don't be mad, Alex. He just cares about Jo, too. Right, Agent Brooks? It's her. Hey. I need to see you and Alex right now. Benny's dead. Helen killed him. Did you get the killshot? It didn't work. Where's Chris? Before he died, Benny told me how to destroy the power source. I need it. Jo, where's Chris? I don't know. We don't have time. Do you have it? Yeah, yeah. Take out your gun. What? That's not Jo. Take out your gun. That's not Jo. How can you tell? Shoot her. Shoot her! It was worth a try. No! We have got to get the hell out of here! Are you okay? Piper. Piper, you're the best. The best. It's gone. She got the power source. Come on! Piper. You're very brave. Hi. Yay. Mm! You were great. You alright? Yep. Yeah? She's gone. Yeah. Good. It's broken. What happened? Is there a way to stop this? This is gonna be like a nuke when it goes off. We gotta get out of here right now. Alright, we're at the east docks. Piper, right now. It won't be enough. It will be too big. Bigger than this building. Bigger than this island. It will go all the way to our house. And farther than that. Yeah. She might be right. What do we do, Alex? What do we do? Alex, there's gotta be something. There's gotta be something. We should just get out of here as fast as we can. I think I can stop it. What? Well, this is exciting. It doesn't belong to you. Ah, my dear... it's more mine than anybody's. What's this? No idea. Okay. Well, you win some, you lose some. Let's roll out, everybody. -Wrap it up. -Let's go. Eh, what a shame, Mr. Denman. Wasting all that time and taxpayer money for nothing. Health is something that everyone takes for granted, right, Mr. Sawyer? I'm glad you're feeling good. I hope it lasts. Yeah, we should  we should go now! I really think I can stop this. And then no one will get hurt. Piper... Why do you have this? I wanted to make sure I could give it to you. Piper, look at me. We are going home. Remember when we almost got hit by a truck? But I stopped it. I made like, this bubble around us, and we were safe. This is much bigger than that, though, sweetheart, okay? I can do it. Mnh-mnh. No. I know I can. It's too dangerous. You can't. We gotta go. Okay? I already am. What? Piper. What'd you do? What is that? It's the necklace I gave Piper. She must have switched it with the disk. Why? She doesn't think she's coming back. Okay. Look at me. Come here. Look at me. Piper. Yeah. Okay. Don't do this, okay? Please don't do this. Stay with me, okay? Please. I'm happy... I was in your family. No, sweetie. No. I don't believe it. Jo... Don't. Jo. Don't. No, I-I Yeah. I know. I need you to do something. Take the bracelet off of Helen. Why? She's a shell, right? And I saw Helen become you, so maybe... she can become her. Are you insane? Maybe. But this whole thing's kind of insane, right? And one more crazy thing won't hurt. Not if we can bring her back. Okay. Hang on, hang on. We don't even know that Helen's really gone. Just wait. Wait, wait. Hello. Hi. Can we go home? Yeah, we can go home. A paring knife? I had to work with the tools available. Well, you're a butcher. It was some kind of bug? No. I wish it was a bug. It was a nanobot. I have those now. Oh. Do you know what that means? Not yet, but... Do you remember how Helen said she could cure you? Hard to forget. Yeah. I think I know how she was going to do that. I'm still figuring it out. I'll let you know. Thanks. So you woke up as a different person. How did you turn yourself back? I just thought, "I just want to be me again." And then I was. Okay. Now turn into me. Okay. No, no. Huh-uh. We're not doing that. Mom. This is for science. Mia, you just got weird. Alright. I can't believe I have to say this. Uh...no turning into other people. Now or in the future. Okay? Okay. And the first time  the first time  I hear about you doing anything like that, I'm gonna slap that bracelet on your wrist forever. You would do that? Test me. See if I mean it. She'd do it. I'm just glad I'm me now. Don't. Okay. Break out the champagne if anybody's interested. I love you very, very much. Yes, please. Yes, that would be gre I gotta take this. Hey. Um...I'm sorry about Benny. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I think he probably saved my life. Heard a lot of radio traffic. Boats landing on Plum Island about an hour ago. Somebody's cleaning up. Who? FBI? Uh, no. I don't think so. Such a jerk move, right? Mm-hmm. Who pays for that, you know? Not Justice. They'd have to admit they were even here. You think they'll be back? I think they wanted to stop Helen, and we did that for them. I think they really just wanted Piper's code. What she can do now... just be careful, okay? I know. I will. Ouch. I know. That was one weird date, Evans. Yeah. You know, I usually like to save minor surgery for, like, three months in, but... just couldn't wait. Your family's incredible. A bunch of superheroes. Yeah. They're alright. And Alex coming up with that idea about Piper  Yeah. He's a stand-up guy. I like him. Great. I'm just kind of wondering if there's still some stuff... you need to figure out with all that. Brooks... 'Cause, um... I'm kind of in trouble here. So I'd just like to know. When you figure it out. Okay. I'll let you get back to your family. Hey, you know how you can change your own programming? Yes. Maybe you can change it so you can pick up your stuff once in a while. I would really love that. Nope. Can't do it. Oh, well, it was worth a shot. Think you're gonna be able to sleep? I think so. Yeah? Good. Listen, I am really, really sorry about Benny. You were right. I know. Yeah. Maybe someday I'll see him again. Mm. I really don't think so, sweetheart. I have a question. Okay. What happens after you die? Oh, my God. No way. Nice try. Not tonight. Go to sleep. Mwah. Wow. Okay, good night. "What happens after we die?" Come on. I'm just saying a total ban is an overcorrection. When the fact that Piper can look like anyone  that's very advantageous, Jo. No. That's not up for discussion. Oh, come on. She can do the "Face/Off." She can do the "Face/Off." That's a great argument, but still no. How are you still standing? Huh? I mean, I'm gonna sleep for like a week. I don't know how to thank you, Alex. It's nothing. I was very happy I could be there. Um... Listen, I know I... rely on you for, uh... you know, everything, pretty much, and that's... not fair. Um...it's easy. For me. But it's not fair. Jo... No, listen. Um... We worked really hard to figure out boundaries and  and custody and how to be good co-parents, and I...um... you know, I really want to get better at that, if that's something that  Jo, I took the job. I'm sorry. This is not the way I wanted to tell you. No. It's okay. Yeah. I got a really good lead on a place, too. Room for Mia. Great neighborhood. Walkable. I think she'll dig it. I was thinking maybe you and I could talk to her together when we're ready. Yeah. No, absolutely. Cool. Alright. Okay. Alright. Don't go. What? You know, don't don't  don't go. Why? What do you mean "why"? If it's because you love me... and you want to try again, then yeah. Let's talk about that. I'd stay for that. If that's not what you're saying, then... Jo, what the hell are we doing? If you don't know, that's cool. I just can't stay while you figure out what it is you want. Okay. Okay. Did they use it? Yeah. They did. There's no sign of Helen anywhere, though. I know where she is. Or... where part of her is. Look familiar? I'm thinking. You just executed a search warrant there. I don't get it. W Helen's there? In a sense. It's not Helen anymore, however. She's the girl. That's...bananas. But I like it. If it works. I was just about to conduct a test. Let's see if we...
