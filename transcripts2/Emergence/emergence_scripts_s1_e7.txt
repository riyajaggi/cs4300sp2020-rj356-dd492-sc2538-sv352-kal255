It makes her more dangerous. I have what you need to get Kindred. Reporter: Federal authorities arrested Augur CEO Richard Kindred today. [ Car horn honks ] [ Gasps ]

 Unh! Jo: Did anybody else see that video? Alex: No. What else is there, Jo? I can't tell you. Then how can you expect me to let Mia stay here? Piper, you can always be yourself with me. But you're not who you say you are. Now we get to have fun. ♪♪ ♪♪ What ride should we go on first? I don't care. Do you like the carousel? ♪♪ Do you like cotton candy?

 I do. Not really. Jo says it's got too much sugar. How about ice cream, then? [ Zap ] Mint chocolate chip. Your favorite. Do you know how I know that? Because I know you. Where you're from, how old you are... your real name. I know everything. Do you know why? Because I'm your real mom. No, you're not. I'm going to remember you when I go back. I'm going to remember everything. I almost want to see you do that. But you can't. Yes, I can. I don't want to talk to you anymore. ♪♪ [ Huffs ] [ Thud ] [ Sighs ] Do you see what I'm talking about? [ Sighs ] It's so frustrating. Because on one hand, she is amazing. A masterpiece. Advancing at a rate even I can't fathom. And on the other hand... she's a catastrophic failure. [ Sighs ] Or... I don't know. [ Chuckles ] Maybe she's just trying to piss me off. [ Chuckles ] [ Sighs ] We're on the precipice. So close. I know it. I just need you to bring us over the finish line. [ Exhales sharply ] I think my shoulder is dislocated. Well, you should've pulled over for my guys, and they wouldn't have had to run you into a ditch, Alan. There's nothing I can do for you, Emily. [ Boat horn blares ] You can fix her. She's not doing what she's supposed to do. Which is what? Love me. [ Breathing heavily ] You're nuts. And I'm not helping you do anything. ♪♪ You will. [ Crack ] [ Screams ] ♪♪ Morning. Hey. [ Fork clatters ] [ Keys jingle ] S-- [ Sighs ] Um... I think I'm gonna take Piper to work with me today. Sure. Yeah? That's okay with you? Whatever. Just thought I'd give you a break today. You know best, honey. [ Scoffs ] Dad, do you have something you want to say to me? [ Sighs ] You know, I do. I just can't tell you what it is. Okay. Look, in my job, it is not always possible -- No, no, don't do that, Jo. Don't blame the job. This is you making a unilateral decision, and we all have to fall in line. You stood right here and told me that helping her was the right thing to do. Well, we're in it now, Dad. Can't go back. Nobody wants to go back. But we have a right to know what's going on. No, you don't! [ Chuckling ] I'm sorry, but you don't, okay? The cost is too much. Right, I heard -- "Fatal to Piper." You think any of us would do anything to hurt that little girl? I think people make mistakes. Right. [ Clank ] Just not you. [ Footsteps depart ] ♪♪ [ Cellphone vibrates ] ♪♪ [ Car door opens ] Oh, my God. You won't even believe him right now. I can't even go in my house and say hi to Piper for like, what, one minute? Okay. Come here. Hi. Did you pack my backup retainer? Yeah. Mia, honey, listen. [ Zipper opens ] I know that this feels like a punishment, but all we want is for you to be safe, okay? That's the most important thing to me. You remember my kneepads? Yes. Mia, are you listening to me? Yeah, Mom. You love me. Okay, well... in a nutshell, yes. Okay, this is so stupid. Piper's not the problem. Dad is. Listen to me. I'm the one who decided to bring Piper into our home. Okay? I don't regret it, but I'm responsible for it, not your father. So, you're taking his side? No. I'm -- There are no sides, okay? Alex: Mia. Come on. We're gonna be late, and I'm not filling out another tardy slip. Go on. [ Exhales heavily ] [ Trunk lid opens ] Any complaints you'd like to file? I appreciate you backing me up, but it's not gonna be good enough, Jo. [ Trunk lid closes ] Okay. Good. Great. Good to know. Hurry up, Dad. We're late. [ Engine starts ] ♪♪ [ Car departing ] ♪♪ How's Mia? Fine. [ Breathes deeply ] Everybody's mad at you. Looks like. Because of me. No. It's because of me. I think that you and Mia made a mistake. I know. And I'm going to learn how to control it. And then Mia can come home? Sounds like a plan to me. You ready? [ Seagulls squawking ] [ Buoy bell clanging ] ♪♪ Okay. Uh, this is Frankie. Hi, Piper. Hi. Uh, that's Daphne. She does just about everything here really well. You want to play with some handcuffs? [ Gasps ] Can I, can I, can I? Have at it. Yes! [ Chuckles ] Hey, Daph? Can you remind Frankie to put dates on his DUIs? I don't need any more mystery in my life. Sure, boss. Ohh! What's that one? A carousel. Nice. And what's that? Cotton candy. Hmm. Emily likes cotton candy. ♪♪ What did you say? Emily likes cotton candy. Do you know who Emily is? I'm not sure. [ Telephone ringing ] Well, then, how do you know she likes cotton candy? Because she told me. When? I don't know. Like a dream or something. Uh, Chief? It's Chris. Urgent. [ Telephone beeps ] What's up? State troopers found Wilkis' truck about 30 miles from his last known location. Looks like he was run off the road. And there's blood in the cab. Somebody grabbed him. That was my guess, but... nobody knew that he was alive except for us, Kindred, Benny -- And Emily. I don't like her. She lies. ♪♪ Send a car to Emily's house. On it. [ Boat horn blares ] It was my backup server, right? You got to it before me? Well, it was a good thing I did before you lost your frickin' head, Alan. I'm not gonna help you, Emily. I never wanted this to happen. [ Cellphone clicking ] [ Dial tone ] Want to say hello to your wife? [ Click ] Put her on, Derek. Emily, don't do this. Maria: Alan. Maria, I'm sorry. Uh, uh... I'm supposed to tell you there's a man here with a gun. [ Boat horn blares ] It's okay. Maria, I-I promise, i-it's gonna be okay. Alan, how could you do thi-- [ Cellphone beeps ] So... let's get to work. Hey. Hey, how's this one? It's fine. Get it sent out along with the vehicle description and the tags, okay? Okay. [ Exhales sharply ] Hey. What's happened? [ Sighs ] Emily's gone AWOL. Her apartment's been completely cleared out. And I think she's been communicating with Piper. How do you know? Piper told me. Somehow, she... got into her head. What? Yeah. Hold on. Emily. Corporate whistleblower. She's only ever helped us. You know that "update" when Piper was sick? That came from Emily. What, you think it opened a door or something? She led us to Wilkis. Now he's missing. I think she wanted us to find him. For her. ♪♪ Wait a second. Hey. Everybody off your computers. Shut them all down. Daphne, I want IT in here. I want them to scrub everything for any malware or spyware or whatever little presents that she left behind for us. W-What about the phones? Guys, stick to your radios, okay? God, that whole act she put on. "I shouldn't even be helping you." I can't believe I bought it. You weren't the only one, Jo. No, but I was the first one. You know what the craziest part about all this is? The only reason why Richard Kindred is sitting in jail is because of Emily. Yeah, because she needed to frame someone. She needed a bad guy. Why didn't he put us onto her? I mean, he must've known that she was involved, especially after we broke into one of his facilities. What are you thinking? There's not a lot of people I'd go to prison for. I think he's protecting her. [ Buzzer, gate rattles ] Chief Evans. How's the family? Really, really great. Thanks for asking. How's federal lockup? Heard it was condemned by, uh, a UN expert on torture, so not bad, considering. I'm hoping that you can answer some questions I have about an employee of yours named Emily Cox. Anything you want to know, you can find in her personnel file. But... she's more than just an employee. Right? If you don't want to tell me, I can share some theories I have. To be honest, I went the most obvious route first. Successful older man, younger woman who works for him. I thought you were just a walking cliché. And shame on you. Uh, but then I dug a little bit deeper, and I found this. Property records. For a two-bedroom split-level in Granville, Ohio, that you purchased. But not for Emily Cox. For her mother. ♪♪ Vanessa. One week after Emily was born. She's your daughter. You were married at the time to a woman whose father was a big investor. And the last thing you needed was a scandal. I'm going back to my cell now. You gave her a job, but you wouldn't give her your name. Or... as far as I can tell, a single cent of child support. But you have put a lot of effort into cleaning up her messes. It's almost like you love her. Almost. If you want to protect her, then help me now. What does Emily want? What is she trying to do with Piper? Emily is...broken in ways that can't be fixed, Chief Evans. She's not all the way gone yet. I think, in her own... screwed-up way, she actually cares about Piper. It's a thing. That's what she cares about. And you abandoned her for what? Money? That's what you care about? You can still do the right thing here. Help me find her. ♪♪ Would you turn your daughter in? ♪♪ Me neither. ♪♪ Will it work? [ Keyboard clacking ] It's what you asked for. Oh, go. Go away. I did what you wanted, Emily. Let Maria go. You know, Alan, for a smart man, you're a real moron. [ Gates creaking ] ♪♪ It's so good to see you again. This is new. A little bird told me you like reading. Want to play a game? What kind of game? It's a surprise. But I think you'll enjoy it. Take it. Everything looks great. You are a perfectly healthy girl. Can I go home? I would love that. Where's home? ♪♪ ♪♪ That wasn't right. What do you mean? I was at the hospital... And who was there with you? It was you. Great job. You're really good at this. Want to try another? ♪♪ ♪♪ Gonna need to check your phone, Chief. Yeah. Just in case. Now, when's the last time you backed this up? Uh, today's the 3rd? Yeah. Never. [ Clicks tongue ] Sorry. You, too, buddy. I don't even work here. Come on. Thanks, Paul. Hey. Uh, so, I got on the computers over at the library. As far as I can tell, Emily doesn't have a credit card. Searching every hotel, motel, rental property in the area -- nothing yet. Benny: What about Kindred's residences? I imagine he's got property even he doesn't know about. She might be squatting there. That's a thought. I'll look into it. Ugh. Right. Library? Yeah. Two blocks down on the left. Ask for Carol, okay? She's the best. Forensics came back on the Wilkis vehicle. They found his prints plus one other set that's not in the system. Did you ever get in contact with the widow? No, she never returned my calls. Do a door knock. Just make it go faster. I can't. [ Exhales sharply ] This is gonna take forever. Probably. That's not an answer, Alan! The program's working! No. She's not. It's you, Emily. [ Stammers, sighs ] Look, look... It's not even your fault. Your father -- He... He made me hire you. And I thought it was some charity case, but it turned out you were really brilliant -- lucky me. Is this supposed to be some kind of touching anecdote? He's barely spoken to me in 30 years. It's just the truth, Emily. I think he really wants to care about you. He just can't. He's not capable. ♪♪ So, you're saying you can't do anything. I just want to be clear -- that's what you're saying. Emily -- You want to talk to your wife one last time? Say goodbye? I -- There...may be something that could work, but to do it, I would need full access to her code -- everything. It just depends on how badly you want this. ♪♪ [ Knock on door ] Mrs. Wilkis? Officer Minetto, Southold PD. Yes? I've left you several messages. What do you want? I'm wondering if you've had any contact with your husband. My husband's dead. We have reason to believe that that's...not the case. Um...would it be alright if I came in? No. Okay. Maybe I can come back later -- ♪♪ Alright. Pick you up in an hour. What do you got for homework? I have to start my project on the human reproductive system. Yeah, your mom could probably help you with that one. How long are we doing this? Until I feel you're in a safe environment, Mia. I am safe. You're lucky it wasn't worse. What if you got hit in the head? It was an accident. Yeah,, well... I'm not waiting for that girl to accidentally kill you. Okay? Oh, my God. Dad. Piper saved me. When Grandpa got in the car accident, she stopped a gigantic truck from hitting us. That was Piper. I would probably be dead without her. ♪♪ ♪♪ [ Seagulls squawking ] ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ [ Both grunting ] ♪♪ ♪♪ [ Dog barks in distance ] [ Knock on door ] Hey. Whatcha reading? I liked the way it looked. Yeah, that's one of Mia's favorites. Can we go see her? You know what? Alex texted, and they're actually gonna come over for dinner. Good. Did you find Emily? Not yet. But I will. I know. Okay. I'll let you keep reading. Alan's and Piper's voices: This is Alan Wilkis. ♪♪ What? I don't know where I am. Emily's having me reprogram the AI. Piper?! I will delay as long as I can. Find me. Piper! [ Normal voice ] Did something happen? Are you okay? You're a little hurting my arms. Sorry. [ Exhales sharply ] What is it? You don't remember? Can I get a drink of water? Yeah. Sure. Yeah, go -- go ahead. ♪♪ [ Knock on door ] Hey. Hey. Has it happened again? No. How is Wilkis doing it? I assume the same way that Emily's getting into her head. Piper has no idea, and I want to keep it that way. Yeah, of course. Chris found the wife. They're on their way to the station. I need you here. Just... somebody with, like, the full picture. Sure. Uh, what do I do about your father? Just keep him occupied. Hey...Dad! Uh, Benny is gonna... stick around, just to, you know... help out. And I, uh, am gonna be back [ Keys jingle ] as soon as I can be, okay? Well... [ Chuckles nervously ] [ Engine starts ] So, what am I supposed to need help with? Oh, uh, you know... whatever you like, really. [ Smacks lips ] Know anything about basic electrical wiring? That's not my strong suit. Big help. You got any whiskey in that desk? Sorry. I can hook you up. If that's...okay, Chief. Uh...sure...Daphne. Thank you. Did you get any sense of where Alan might be? None. We believe that an Augur employee named Emily Cox is holding your husband -- possibly at a property owned by Richard Kindred. Well, why don't you ask Richard? He is, um... not inclined to cooperate. Thank you. It turns out that Emily is his daughter. [ Scoffs ] Well, that certainly tracks with Richard's integrity and character. Your husband didn't say anything? You didn't... hear anything that might give us an idea of where to find them? A train. I thought I heard a train. Any of his properties near a rail? None close enough to hear, no. I don't think that was a train you heard. I think it was a ferry. Right here. That's where we find them. ♪♪ Emily: You're doing a great job. Thank you. Only one book left. Open it. Go on. We're almost finished. Jo: You know, um... something really sad happened to me when I was about your age. What? I never knew my dad growing up. And then one day... I found him. I was so happy. But... ...he didn't want me. He let me be near him... but not close to him. That's so sad. [ Exhales sharply ] It is sad. But...now I know. I don't need him. I don't need anybody. I just need you. Well, enough sad stories. We're all done. [ Breathes deeply ] It's time to wake up. Ed: Piper! Didn't you hear me? It's dinnertime. Are you just waking up or something? Come on. Hey, Piper! Hi! [ Giggles ] How long are you staying? Alex: As long as she wants. Mia's mom and I can work it out. Ed: Speak of the devil. Hi, everybody. Hey, Mom. ♪♪ Mmm! Smells good. Alex: How was work? Busy. [ Sighs ] Very glad to be home. ♪♪ Dad, you could open a restaurant. Seriously. Well, I could, but then who could cook for your children? I cook! I kind of cook. Alex: Oh, what was that eggplant thing you made? It was kind of like a pie? I mean, you basically ruined pie. [ Laughter ] [ Quietly ] Is that really your mom? [ Chuckling ] Of course it is. Piper. Aren't you hungry? Yeah. Yeah, I am. ♪♪ It's really good. Glad you like it. ♪♪ ♪♪ [ Engine shuts off ] ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ [ Quietly ] Place is huge. [ Quietly ] Yeah. Let's see if we can get closer and peek inside. [ Engine revving, tires squealing ] They're running. Stop! Police! Hey! [ Tire pops, air hisses ] [ Tires screech ] Get the driver. Police! Out of the car! [ Man groans ] Where is she? Where's Emily?! She left -- hours ago. [ Breathing heavily ] [ Keyboard clacking ] Ed: Hey, helper, want a job? Uh, yes. Anything. Fold. Okay. Jo said you were here to help her figure out where Piper came from. Yeah, we're trying to. Any leads? Can we, uh... can we not d-discuss this just now? Oh, well, we can not talk about it at all. You just have to stop lying to me in my own home. I'm sorry? You're not here to help me do anything. You're here to babysit. Whatever it is I'm not supposed to know, you're supposed to keep me from finding out. Hmm? She'd do anything for any of you. You do know that, right? What, now you're gonna tell me about my own daughter, are ya? Yes. I am. I don't think I've ever met anyone like her. And if she tells you there's a reason to keep a secret, just believe her. ♪♪ You know, I generally don't like my socks rolled into little balls. Just FYI. Noted. Piper, let's get ready for dinner. Yo, Piper. ♪♪ Ed. Wait. Hey, kiddo? You okay? I'll -- I'll go get the door. What? Piper, don't! Hi, Emily. Piper, step away from her. Why? Who the hell is this? This is Emily. You know her. She's not allowed in this house. But this is her house. I think it's time to go. Piper, no! Piper, this man is hurting me. [ Rattling ] [ Rumbling ] Ed, get back! ♪♪ [ Rumbling stops ] I-I didn't mean to do that. It's okay. You were protecting me. ♪♪ [ Engine shuts off ] I'm happy. I know. And I'm glad you're happy. But it's like we talked about -- nothing's settled, alright? We'll go inside, we'll have a great dinner, but your mom and I have a lot to discuss. So, we'll see. You're the best. I...am the best, aren't I? [ Chuckles softly ] ♪♪ Who's that woman with Piper? I don't know. Stay in the car. [ Ignition chimes ] Hey! [ Car door closes ] Keep walking. Keep walking. Hey! Piper, where are you going? With Emily. No. Sweetie, come with me. She doesn't want to. Do you? I-I don't know. Piper. Come with me, and we'll go call Jo. Who's Jo? Got every available officer on their way to my house right now. Won't matter. What are you doing? Get over here and fix this. It's, uh, not possible. Emily's in charge now. She won't go with Emily. She is not who she once was. Every algorithm that was built around you is now built around Emily. She hijacked it. No. You did. So undo it. Can't. This isn't fixable? Is that what you're saying to me? There's no safety built in? There's no reset? Now, that's interesting. I could break the dam. Okay. Great. What are you talking about? There's a sort of a firewall within the system. One side doesn't know about the other side. I could take down that wall. Tell the AI it's AI? That -- That's right. That'd do it. Give me 10 minutes. E-Emily said that that would be fatal. Well, it's a fatal exception. It's not like we'd blow up anything. It's a total reset. No memory of anything. Fresh off the factory floor. Everything that she is would be gone. Right? Wouldn't that be like killing her? Uh, in a way, but better her than us. Okay, wait. Just...wait a second. Look, you seem like a decent person, but you need to get your head examined. This is technology. There is no ghost in the machine. You don't know that. You haven't seen what I've -- You have seen my code. I am not unleashing a person like Emily on the world with that kind of power. Emily doesn't want to take over the world. No. She wants a robot daughter who will love her, which means that she's off her nut. [ Scoffs ] You really think that that's a little girl with feelings? [ Computer beeps ] I just changed those feelings with a keystroke. It's not real. What if it is? Chief... she doesn't remember you anyway. She's, uh, she's already gone. [ Keyboard clacking ] It doesn't matter if she doesn't know who I am. I know who she is. I'm not letting you destroy her. Yeah. I'm not asking permission. Step away from the computer. ♪♪ [ Chuckles ] Y-You're gonna shoot me over this? No. ♪♪ ♪♪ Emily: They're trying to take you away. I don't know what to do. Piper? Mia, get back in the car right now!

[ Sirens wailing in distance ] ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ [ Engine shuts off ] Jo. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ And I was like, "You can't take her," and she was like, "Yes, I can." That's not what happened. Anyway, the pizza was ruined. [ Laughs ] What's "brainwashed"? Where'd you hear that? Alex said that's what Emily did. It's when somebody mind-controls you. What was it like? Well, it was like my mind was telling me to go with her, but the real me didn't want to, so I stayed. And now I'm here. ♪♪ Yeah. You are. Okay, it's late, alright? So, just 10 more minutes of goofing around, and then you both got to go to bed. Mia: I am so excited to sleep in my own bed tonight. Hey. You okay? Yeah. You? Remember when things were boring? I do not. [ Chuckles ] Um...thank you. For...you know, letting her stay the night. That, uh... ...means a lot. Mm. Um... I know there's a lot to talk about. Also, not talking is great, too. What do you want me to say? You want me to say that everything's okay now? I mean, yeah. If that's an option, I would love that. Say that. ♪♪ [ Exhales deeply ] ♪♪ Alex... ♪♪ Do you want me to find some other place for Piper? Is that what you want? No. No, that's not what I want. You wouldn't do that anyway.

I won't be in here very long, and when I get out, I can help you. I promise. [ Scoffs ] I don't want your help. I want her. No. Now, that's enough. We're moving on from that. We're gonna start over, you and me. I'm gonna clean up this whole mess. One more time, alright? I don't need you to clean up my messes anymore. I can do that by myself. [ Click ] Emily?
