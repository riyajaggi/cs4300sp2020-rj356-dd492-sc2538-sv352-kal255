 Previously on "Emergence"... - It told me who I am. - What is that? It's an exabyte disk. The disk is her. When I first got here, I cut something out of my neck. What? Ryan Brooks. I'm with the FBI. Some woman named Helen reached out to my family to make a deal. They cure my father's cancer.

 And in return, I hand over Piper. We can make this joint task force. Where's Piper? Benny said he was taking her to you. I need you to put out an APB. I'm a friend. I wanna go home. Jo will never understand you. Because she's not like you. What do we do? We get her back. Evans. Hey. We've been watching it for over an hour. Windows are covered, nobody in or out.

 Are we sure this is his place? Landlord says Benny's on the lease for two years, neighbors know him. Everyone's set. Ready? Ready? Alright, let's go. - Cover. - Eyes on our HVT. - Upstairs, clear! - Kitchen's clear! Get the evidence response team in here. I want them to comb through everything. 10-4. I'll get on radio... Maybe they never came here. We ran his financials. Closed his bank accounts, canceled his credit cards. He was planning this. I just don't get it. He was helping me. He was... He was a friend. We can't even dig up a relative, alive or dead. Totally standard background check up until 15 years ago, and then it just stops. It's like he didn't even exist before then. That hers? That means we're close. She's only been gone eight hours, tops. We're gonna find her. Okay? Okay. Hi. Is this Frank Fontana? Yes, it is. Hi. My name is Jo Evans, and I'm a police chief in Long Island, New York. Um, about three years ago, you did an interview with a reporter named Benny Gallagher, and I was just wondering if you had any information on his where abouts or if you... I'm sorry? Um... Yeah. I did not, um, realize that it was so late. I'm... I'm... I apologize. I will try you another time. Y... Okay. I don't think she's coming back. We don't know that, honey. I know. It's just a feeling. Scooch over. She must be so scared. You know, I worry about that, too. But then I think... she's really brave. And she's smart. Like you. Do you think you'll find her? I think... most of the time, people don't just disappear. There's almost always something that tells us where to look for them. So, I just have to find what that is. Okay? Hey, uh, Chief. Hey. Hey, so, I got the annual crime report data together. Should have it ready to publish by the end of the week. Uh, that... that look okay? Yeah. It's perfect. Um, as you can see, there's been a big uptick in bonkers, so... Uh, oh, and I'll... I'll handle that event with the mayor Thursday. Thursday... Oh, no. Oh, no, I got it. Uh, wish I could do more. Mornin'. Hey. Hey. Oh, thanks, man. Yeah. So, Benny spent a bunch of time in Boston in 2016. I'm gonna make some phone calls, see if he made any friends while he was there. Do you know anybody who... What's wrong? Um... I'm being pulled. Effective immediately. Oh. Yeah. I tried to get my boss to give me a couple more weeks, but she wouldn't go for it. Listen, I'm still gonna work on the case whenever I can. Yeah, I know. When are you... When are you leaving? Uh, I-I was thinking I was gonna hit the road now, I guess. Beat the traffic. Traff... Yeah. Hey. Uh... line one's a detective from the 4-4 in the Bronx. They, um... They got a body. Matches the description. She wants to send a photo. This is Evans. Sure. Hi, Detective. I am by a computer. Do you know where to send that? Okay. Why don't you go ahead and send it on over? She's not ours. Sure. Thanks. Good luck. Okay. It's not her. Okay. Hey. How'd it go today? About the same. How's Mia? She's sad. I don't know what to do for her. I don't know what to do for anybody. We need to figure out how we're gonna talk to her about this. I don't want to lie to her. Talk about what? The way this probably ends. Jo, what happened today? You don't want that in your head. I hate that. I hate when you do that. I have nothing. Not a thing. I am no closer. And I don't know how much longer I can do this. Mom. Mom, come here! Look. What the hell is that? Okay. Jo, no. No, no, no. What the hell is that? Piper. Evans. What happened? She contacted us. What? How? Okay, I'm gonna tell you, and I realize how it sounds, but I just need you to believe me, okay? W-Where is she? There was a power surge at my house last night. And I need you to track down where it came from. I don't understand. It was her. Brooks, there was this symbol burned into the TV. I've seen it before. You... You think she's in the TV? No, I don't think she's in the TV. Listen. She tried to reach out to us, okay? I-I don't know how I know. I just... I just do. I know. Oh, my God. Stop with that face. Look, you know as well as I do, people sometimes see what they want to see. Okay. You know what? I've changed my mind, alright? I don't need you to believe me. I just need you to help me. Can you do that? Technically, I'm not even supposed to be working on this. So, yes? No, I... I don't want to give you false hope. I mean, that sounds like a yes. It's not a yes. You're gonna think about it, and then it's gonna be a yes. Call me when it's a yes! Hey. Hey, Mamita. How are you? Fine. Can I help? Do you have a phone? Y-Y-Yeah. Okay, can you just leave it here with me while you're here? Just in case. Yeah, okay. I need to go get Mom's old tablet. Nobody touch anything. What is this about? Well, evidently, Piper tried to get in touch with us last night. Did she? Well, they seem to think so. Wait, does... Does Jo think it's real? Yeah. I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing. I'm worried about you guys. Yeah, me too. The electric company said there was no power surge last night. They're wrong. I saw it. Well, they didn't register it. Totally normal levels across the grid. Uh, Agent Brooks is on the phone. Yes? Do you have a satellite TV? Yeah. Why? It wasn't a power surge. It was the communications satellite. At 6:36, the satellite received a signal that fried the transponder. It's now a $400 million piece of space junk. What? But before it died, it sent a message... To you. Where'd the signal come from? Closest ground station is Elk County, Pennsylvania. There's a flight out of LaGuardia in three hours. I'm leaving now. You think you can make it? Yeah. Yeah. I'll be there. So? Brooks came through. What happened? Uh, well... the short version is that Piper broke a satellite. What? And I got to go to Pennsylvania. Um... I am designating you Acting Chief while I'm gone. Oh. Sure. Okay. Um, how... how long would you be going, would you... would you say? Chris, you know what I do. You've been doing it anyway. If you don't trust yourself, trust me. You've got this! She's got mock trial after school, and she has a math test on Thursday. Jo, I know all of this. Okay. What's hap... What is happ... It's for Piper. No, honey. No, no, no. Pick just one. Pick one. Please. Okay, did you pack her toothbrush? No. Okay, I should've just packed for you. Can you just get... Thank you. Let's see. Oh. There are clean sheets on the bed. Oh, wow. I'm sleeping on the couch. What? Why? Just take the bed. It's fine. No. Whatever. Suit yourself. You know, I'm not crazy about you doing this alone. I'm not going alone anyway. Brooks is going, too. Oh, I-I didn't catch that. Okay, I got bubble gum because Piper does not like mint. - Good thinking. - Here we go. Come here. Mm! I won't be gone long, okay? O-Okay. Yeah. Just hurry up and get her. O... kay. Thank you for those five seconds of affection. Be careful. I'll call. Gotta replace all that netting! Yousef. Hey. Where's Chief? You're looking at him. Chief Evans is out of town for a bit, so I'm Acting Chief until she gets back. I don't like that very much. W-W-What's the problem? This boat. Yeah. It's in my slip. Yousef, that's not a police matter. Talk to the harbor master. I don't talk to that guy. Okay. Yousef, you do this again, I'm gonna charge you with filing a false police report. That's what Chief Evans said to me last week. Okay. I'm just saying, you're showing some leadership skills. It's nice. Uh, hey, guys. Um, what are you transporting? Sauvignon blanc. Oh, cool. Mind if I, uh, take a look? Sorry. We're running late. Look at you. Hey. Uh, come in. Close the door. Big man in the big chair. Uh, could you... could you close the door, please? Yeah. Yeah, sure. What's up? So, I, uh... I need to speak to someone that... That knows what's going on. Oh. That ain't me. I, um... I got called down to the harbor today, and... and there was this crate being loaded onto a boat. It had this really strong magnetic pull. What was it? I was hoping you could tell me. It could be an electromagnet. But those things are big, eat up a ton of power. Okay, but we've seen stuff like this before, right? Like, this... This can't be a coincidence. To be honest, the only way to really find out is for us to go and take a look for ourselves. Oh, uh, no. I'm not breaking the law my first day as chief. Come on, man. You said so yourself... This isn't a coincidence. It's about Piper. Yeah, but... but... but... But the Chief would want... Would already know what's in the crate. Come on! Be like Jo. Looking for spot C-34. Check into the hotel first? Uh... you know, by the time we get there, it's gonna be almost 6:00. I want to find whatever the local dinner spot is, talk to the regulars, see what they know. Sure. I could eat. Uh, listen, just to be clear, we're not going in interrogating people. Don't take notes, don't pull out your little recorder. Oh. Right. Well, you're pretty smart about all that. I just... I know how towns like this operate. Sure. Sure. Chat people up, see them in their natural environment. Yeah. While they're picking up their coffee. Or their daughter's birthday cake. Okay. I'm talking about you. Yeah. Got it. 'Cause I did that. To you. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Good job. Uh... Who is this? Mia packed him for Piper. Just... when we find her. Piper really became part of the family. Yeah. Unh. He's gonna ride up with me. Shotgun! Hey, kid. Come on. Let's shut it down. Let's give it a rest for a little while. Okay? No. Not right now. It may not happen again, Mia. She doesn't even know that we're looking for her. She doesn't know that Mom's coming. She knows that we didn't just forget about her. I mean, I guess I just wish that we could send her a message or something. Ah. I-I doubt that's even possible. I wouldn't even know how. You know... maybe you're right. Maybe we can figure out a way to reach out to her. You think so? Give it a shot. Let's see what we can do. Everybody okay at home? I assume so. Left a voicemail for Alex. Took guts for him to participate in that sting. Seems like you guys have a good relationship. Yeah, we get along fine. Have to. We've got a kid together. Well, you're good at it, though. Wouldn't have been that way with my ex, if we'd had kids. Couldn't pick her out of a lineup today. Sorry. Oh, it's okay. It was almost 10 years ago. Longer than we were even married. What's it been, like, a year for you guys? About that, yeah. Yeah, I can tell. You can tell. How? Just have this really honed, incredible power of perception. Well, that doesn't sound right. Did you do a background check on me? No, but... great idea. Oh, that first year's just... really weird. You have to retrain your brain. This person who was really important in your life isn't supposed to be anymore. But they still are. Y'all need anything? Yeah. Um, you have a minute? Oh, mm-hmm. My colleague and I are from out of town. We're law enforcement. Oh. You're not in trouble. We just want to ask you about a case that we're working on. We'd love your help. Oh. Did you experience any power surges or blackouts last night? Uh, no, I don't think so. What about these two? Have you seen either one of them? Oh, yeah. Yeah, I-I saw him, for sure. He has an accent, right? When was this? Couple of nights ago. I was getting gas. Where's the gas station? On 5th. It's closed now. Can we get the check? Sure, but there's no rush. Charlie's in the main dining room. He owns the gas station. They could've come in. Lotta people do. Why don't you look a little bit harder, Charlie? Yeah, now that I think of it, he came in asking for directions. He got turned around looking for the interstate. I mean, that can't happen very often. People stopping in to ask for directions, I mean, what with GPS and all. Are we done? Almost. How long have you owned the station? Um, I bought it when I moved here, about 15 years ago. 15 years, huh? That's a long time. Where were you before that? Pittsburgh. Oh. Nice. Yeah. Love that city. Where'd you live? Hey! Hey! Out of the way! Out of the way! Go. Go, go. Get down! Get down! Get down! Get down! State troopers looking for the car. The sheriff's sitting on the residence. Called the county hospital... They don't have him. No, he wouldn't go to the hospital anyway. So, he... He's a... I mean, the... That was not... a-a person. No. I think he's like Piper. This is unbelievable. This is... Wow. This is not possible. Brooks, what did you think that Piper was? I don't know. I don't know. Just... I'm... Not that. Look, you don't want me or the FBI involved in this. You don't want the FBI anywhere near this. That does not end well for you or Piper. I just don't get it. I mean, you design an AI, and then you make it a gas-station attendant in the middle of nowhere? Why? 15 years. That's how long Charlie's been here. It's how long Splinter's been active. And it's as far back as Benny's history goes. You think Benny's one? If that's true, how many more are there? Could be anybody. Seriously? Yeah. Okay. I'm a robot. Great theory. If we're right about Benny... and my gut didn't warn me, then I can't trust my instincts. I can't trust anybody. Well I don't know what to tell you. I can't prove that I'm a human being. I can. How? Take off your jacket. There was this time Piper was really sick. And the hospital ran every test that they could think of, and there was nothing to indicate she was anything other than a perfectly normal little girl, except for this. Roll up your sleeve. Uh, left one. Whoa. Is it gonna hurt? Honestly, I don't know. Your turn. Okay. Wrong arm. That's me. Uh, Evans. Where'd they find it? Okay. Thanks. Car got towed to an impound lot. Picked up from a parking lot a couple miles away. No Charlie. Let's check it out. Alright. Which one is it? I don't know. They... They all look the same. One second. Okay. Yeah. Okay. To generate that much pull, you'd need an electromagnet half the size of this boat. Yeah. Okay. What is it? I don't know. There are a couple of metals that are liquid at room temperature. But they don't have a charge. - And they don't float. - Go on ahead. I'll cast off the bow line. Hey. They're back. Hey, go, go, go. What is that? This... is a ham radio. There's a powerful repeater out on Orient Point. I even talked to a guy from Mexico once. Okay, but Piper's not a radio. Yeah. I know. But if she really did try to reach out to us through the TV, then I imagine she's tuned into a lot of things. Don't you? Okay. So, you will record a message. I will set it up to repeat through a bunch of frequencies, and then we will send it out as far as it can go. Okay, Grandpa, no offense, but this is so dumb. Just agree to disagree. You're just trying to make me feel better. Yeah, there's nothing wrong with that. What do I do? Alright. Think about what you want to say. Okay. Keep it short. Alright, when I tell you, push that down and talk. Not yet. Okay. Go. Piper, don't be afraid. Mom's coming. That's it? Okay. Okay, good. Good. Alright. Piper, don't be afraid. Mom's coming. This isn't gonna work. Piper, don't be afraid. Mom's coming. Yeah. You're probably right. Piper, don't be afraid. Mom's coming. What was he doing here? He needed medical treatment. Drop it. Now! Drop it. Hey. Charlie. Where's the little girl? We can help you. No. You can't. I just want to take her home. Okay? Where is she? I can't say. Hey! You're gonna die anyway. Just tell us where she is. Even if I wanted to... I can't. What are you doing? Uh... Yeah, I don't think... What the hell is that? What is that? He was trying to remove it. How did you know? Piper had one. She cut hers out, too. Well, I only found his cell. Recent locations. That's the diner. That's got to be his house. I don't know what that is. That's where we're going. That thing was... Well, I don't even know what that thing was, Chris, but that thing was crazy. It was crazy. Okay. We need to find that boat, okay? Get on the phone, call the Coast Guard right now. And tell them what? That we were trespassing on a boat and almost got trapped on it? No. No. No, no, no. We can't tell them that. Um, okay. You're the acting chief of police. Act like the chief of police. What are you doing? Finding... my... phone. You left your phone on the boat? Yes. Yes, I did. And if that boat docks before my battery dies... We find the boat! I'm gonna take back some of the things I said about you. Kill the lights. Cool place. Very "Texas Chainsaw Massacre." You want the house or the outbuildings? Outbuildings. Hey, just... be careful. In case she's actually in there. Hey. I got a good feeling about this one. Piper? Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What is it? I don't know. Set that down. Now show me your hands. Jo. Hands! Jo, please. Where is she? I'm so sorry, Jo. Truly. Tell me where she is. Right... now. This had to happen. I didn't have a choice. I trusted you. She trusted you. You're not gonna shoot me. You're one of them, aren't you? Yes. Well, I just watched one of you die. It seems like you can feel pain. And I am not interested in your apologies or your excuses. So, I'm gonna ask you one last time. Where... is she? Please don't hurt him. Oh, my God, Piper. Don't come closer. I don't want to hurt you. You're not gonna hurt me, Piper. Let's just go home. Okay? I have to stay. No. No, sweetheart. You don't. They need my help. I don't know... what these people have told you... I'm sorry, Jo. Tell Mia... I'm not afraid. Piper! Wh... Piper! Benny! Please! Piper!
