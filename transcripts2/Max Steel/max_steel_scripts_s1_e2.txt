 A giant fire monster. Uh-huh. But what I wanna know is how on earth you're still alive? Well, uncle ferrus...Sorry to disappoint you but-- I'm not talking to you. If you're referring to me, sir, I can assure you it is no thanks to this...Boy. Hah! Me? If it wasn't for you I wouldn't be in this mess, Ya glorified hard drive. Can it the both of you! What were you thinking? Attacking n-tek agents? Stealing n-tek ordnance? We were escaping, obviously. Escaping? You weren't a prisoner! I wasn't? Hm. My apologies. I just can't believe you're back steel! Hold on! You told me this... Thing was my dad's science project. You didn't say anything about him being Your long lost buddy. We all thought you were... Well after the accident-- with jim-- It's good to see you. I wish I could say the same sir, But I have no recollection of you. Yeah he says his memory core is damaged or something. Unfortunate. On the bright side, now that you two are ultra-linked, Steel can help regulate your turbo energy. You are ultralinked? If you mean do I hear his annoying voice in my head? Yeah. And sadly for me, it is completely irreversible. No, that can't be right. You can get him offa me, right?! Nope. So I'm married to this toaster? Yup. My life is ruined. Tell me about it. Enough. Here's the drill: One -steel, you're going to suppress Max's energy signature. Huh? That's how the fire elementor tracked him, isn't it? Yes. And others will follow. Uh... Initiating turbo dampening protocols. Signature suppressed. Sir, I-- er-- I have some bad news. Two - tomorrow you both report to n-tek for testing. And three - no one is to mention any of this to your mom! [in unison] she'll kill us if she finds out. What do you mean we've lost the turbo energy signature?! Well...I don't know. It just vanished! Shall we resume our initial plan--? No! You will find me the source of that turbo energy Or you will find yourself terminally unemployed! Well alright then. [clears throat] Thanks for the ride, uncle ferrus. Remember, keep a low profile. Whoa! Max? Is that you, hon? Oh no, oh man. - Busted! - Whoa! Max is that-- what are you wearing? Oh, this? Uh... Is it a bit nippy in here or is it just me? Is everything okay? Are you coming down with something? No! I mean...I mean yes! Yes...Maybe. That would explain the coat, right? Well, good night! Ha! That door was closed. Oops. [sighs] Oh boy... Forge? We need to meet. So much for hoping it was all just a bad dream. Steel? Max! [knocking] Oh no. Hey mom, everything...Good? Just wanted to make sure you're up. You need to be out the door in 15. Love you too, mom. [sigh] [yelp] I'm okay! Situation normal. What is wrong with you? Utilizing security protocol zed795, I spent the night scanning your clothing So I can replicate your rather, uh... Unique look. Uh-huh. It's unsafe for you to remove the steelsuit, yes? But, through the use of Sophisticated holographic refraction processes And advanced tactile warping algorithms I can make it seem as though you're wearing Your everyday attire. - So...Camouflage mode? - That's what I just said. And you didn't mention this yesterday because...? You didn't ask. [yells] My mistake. This was an outfit from your mother's closet. Whoa. What were you doing in my mother's-- Whoa. Not bad if I do say so myself. You are still safely contained in the steelsuit, But now dressed in your typical fashion. And I use the word fashion very loosely. Nice! This is the thanks I get? [bell ringing] Hey max, thanks for the other day. Those bullies were just about to seriously damage - Their fists on my face. - No prob, kirby! Let's totally hang out sometime. Lemme give you my number. Sure! Dude, what's with the pink communication device? Oh, man. I totally forgot! [sigh] Sydney's gonna kill me. Who exactly is this sydney fellow And why does he want you dead? Syd's a she, not a he- look, it's a long story-- I destroyed her phone. May I see the device? Man, I really messed this up... May I see the device? Ow! Not so loud. Here. - Huh? - Max! There you are! Cool, you remembered to bring my phone! Uhhh... Oh! This? Yes, sure! Here it is. And totally not broken. Oh! Max... That's... Amazing! You made me a playlist! - I did? - You did. Oh, hey, you know, just uh... No big deal. Picked out some cool tunes and-- But how? My phone couldn't even play music before. That would be because I... Tinkered with it. Wow. I can't wait to listen to it! See ya soon, maxwell mcgrath. A playlist?! She's nice. For a human. - I can see why you like her-- - zip it. We gotta get to n-tek. Okay. Where did uncle ferrus say the entrance was? - Strike 1! - Huh. Whoa. [excited yells] This is awesome! Ready to get started? Ready. Go turbo!
