 PREVIOUSLY ON "PARIS HILTON'S BFF DUBAI"... DINA WAS SO SO DISAPPOINTED, SURPRISED, SHOCKED, ANNOYED. I HAVE TO GO TO A RED-CARPET EVENT AND I WANT YOU GUYS ALL TO COME WITH ME RIGHT NOW. THE FINAL SIX ARE A SNEAKY BUNCH OF GIRLS. LIKE, "OH, LET ME DO YOUR HAIR. LET ME FIX YOUR MAKEUP." AS IF THE OTHER GIRLS REALLY WANT YOU TO LOOK BETTER THAN THEM. REEM, WHY DO YOU THINK SHE CHOSE YOU OVER THE OTHERS? I'M NATURAL. I DIDN'T PLAY GAMES AT ALL. THE PERSON I THOUGHT DID BEST WAS REEM. YOU SHOULD HAVE HEARD WHAT SHE WAS SAYING ABOUT YOU YESTERDAY.

 - EXCUSE ME? - YOU SAID, "I CAN'T STAND THE..." - I NEVER SAID THAT. - YEAH, YOU DID. SINCE MY TIME IN DUBAI IS RUNNING OUT, TONIGHT TWO OF YOU WILL BE ELIMINATED. GELAREH... MANDY. THANK YOU. * ALL OF MY LIFE * DON'T YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN WAITING? * * For the best friend? * COULD YOU BE THE ONE I WANT? * * My best friend. I HAD NO IDEA WHAT TO EXPECT WHEN I FIRST LANDED IN DUBAI, BUT I'VE HAD AN AMAZING JOURNEY SO FAR.

 I'VE SEEN SO MANY AMAZING PLACES. I'VE LEARNED SO MUCH ABOUT THE DUBAI CULTURE. PARIS, WE LOVE YOU! - YAY! - AS-SALAMU ALAYKUM DUBAI. AHH! AND I'VE MET SOME REALLY INTERESTING PEOPLE. THE PEOPLE OF DUBAI MADE ME FEEL RIGHT AT HOME. I HAVE MADE SO MANY NEW FRIENDS. I DON'T KNOW HOW I WAS GOING TO CHOOSE MY BFF FROM ALL THESE AWESOME GIRLS. I THINK PARIS SHOULD KNOW THAT I'M VERY TALENTED. * GOTTA LOOK UP TO THE SKY. * I DON'T THINK A GIRL HAS EVER SERENADED ME BEFORE. I LOVE YOU, PARIS. I'M CRAZY ABOUT YOU. OH MY GOD. I BOUGHT YOU... IT'S A TIGER EYE WHICH IS FOR COURAGE. I HOPE IT'S NOT A HUNGRY TIGER EYE. I HAD THE KNOCK-KNOCK JOKE. IT WAS "KNOCK KNOCK." "WHO'S THERE?" "YOUR NEW BEST FRIEND, DALILA." THAT WAS LIKE A CHEESY JOKE. I HOPE HER PERSONALITY IS BETTER THAN HER JOKE. I FEEL THAT YOU ARE NOT EXPOSED TO THE INDIAN AND ISLAMIC CULTURE AND I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE THAT WITH YOU. SO I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE YOU A KISS WITH YOUR PERMISSION. OKAY, SOME OF THEM WERE A LITTLE WEIRD, BUT I MANAGED TO NARROW IT DOWN TO 12 GREAT BFFs. WHO WILL BE MY NEW BFF? GELAREH, REEM, MARTA, BRANKA, MANDY, FARHANA. CHRISTY, AMY, DANA, BASSANT, DINA OR DALILA? THIS PROVED TO BE A TOUGH ONE. WHOO! OH MY GOD. - OH MY GOD. - WOW, I LOVE THIS. WE HAVE... WE HAVE A JACUZZI! WHOO! OH! THE ONLY WAY TO TEST THE BFFs WAS TO PUT THEM THROUGH A SERIES OF CHALLENGES. AND ONE OF MY FAVORITES WAS THE CAMEL CHALLENGE. OH! SOMETIMES THE BFFs HAD TO GET DOWN AND DIRTY. AND WE ALL LEARNED THAT NOT ALL CAMELS APPRECIATE THE SAFFRON-BATH TRADITION. - OY OY OY OY! - OH! IT WAS THE MOST DISGUSTING THING I'VE EVER DONE IN MY LIFE. - - KISS MY... I'M DOING A GOOD JOB. THE ONLY DAY THAT I'M WEARING WHITE, I'M PAINTING A CAMEL WITH SAFFRON. AH! I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE GIRLS WERE COMPLAINING ABOUT. I LOVE CAMELS. AS THE GIRLS GOT TO KNOW EACH OTHER, IT WAS CLEAR THE BIGGEST ISSUE WAS WHO'S REAL AND WHO'S FAKE. YOUR... YOUR... IS GONNA GET ELIMINATED BECAUSE YOU'RE FAKE... F-A-K-E, FAKE. FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE... THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU'RE FAKE AND YOU CAN'T REPLY. YOU SEE, BECAUSE YOU'RE FAKE YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO REACT TO THIS SITUATION. IF YOU WANT TO TALK... "I CAME TO BE FAMOUS. I CAME ON THE SHOW TO BE FAMOUS AND BE A SINGER. I DON'T CARE ABOUT PARIS." GET ME ONE GIRL TO TELL YOU THAT I'M FAKE. I THINK THAT BASSANT IS FAKE. DINA... SHE'S VERY FAKE. AND YOU'RE FAKE BECAUSE YOU SAID YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT PARIS, YOU'RE ONLY HERE TO BECOME FAMOUS. "I'M REAL, I'M REAL, I'M REAL I'M REAL, I'M REAL, I'M REAL, I'M REAL, I'M REAL." MANDY IS VERY VERY FAKE. DINA... SHE'S THE FAKEST PERSON IN THE HOUSE. MANDY... IT'S SO OBVIOUS SHE'S FAKE. THE FAKEST GIRL HERE IS AMY AND DINA. "I'M REAL. WE'RE REAL. NO ONE IN THE HOUSE IS REAL." THERE'S FIVE FAKE PEOPLE IN THE HOUSE. WHOA. SO I HAD ENOUGH OF THIS REAL-FAKE TALK AND I HAD TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS. THE BFFs KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR ME TO FIND A FRIEND WHO'S REAL AND NOT FAKE. SO I HAD THEM SCORE EACH OTHER ON A SCALE OF ONE TO 10, ONE BEING THE MOST FAKE AND 10 BEING THE MOST REAL. AND NO SURPRISE, THIS CHALLENGE TURNED OUT HUGE. FARHANA. GETTING MORE REAL NOW. DA DA DA! REEM. LET'S THEN SEE WHO'S MORE FAKE THAN FARHANA. MARTA. OH! I'M SO SORRY IN THIS MOMENT THAT... IT'S ALL RIGHT. DON'T WORRY. NO. GELAREH. CAN YOU GIVE ME ANOTHER PICTURE? ISN'T THAT FAKE, WORRYING ABOUT YOUR LOOK? - I MEAN, YOU... YOU'RE HERE. - THAT'S NOT BEING FAKE. I'M BEING REAL BY SAYING HOW I FEEL. INTERESTING. I THINK IT SHOWS HOW REAL I AM. AND IF ANYONE THINKS I'M FAKE... SO NOW WE'RE GONNA SEE WHO'S THE NEXT FAKEST. THIS IS REALLY NOT A GOOD PLACE TO BE 'CAUSE YOU'RE FAKE IN THIS SECTION. BASSANT, WHO DO YOU THINK HERE VOTED YOU FAKE? UH, I THINK DINA. I THINK MANDY. WHY? BECAUSE WE LIVE IN THE SAME ROOM SO WE HAVE THE SAME CHOICES? NO, I JUST... I HAVE THE FEELING. AMY. AMY, WHO DO THINK CHOSE YOU TO BE ON THE FAKE SIDE? PROBABLY BASSANT. BASSANT, ARE YOU SURPRISED? I DON'T KNOW. BUT LAST NIGHT AMY WAS MAKING FUN OF PARIS. AND SHE WAS LIKE, "OH, SHE CAME TO THE ROOM. SHE DIDN'T EVEN SAY HI TO ANY ONE OF US." - AND THEN I TOLD HER... - WHO SAID THAT? NO, SHE DIDN'T. THERE'S OTHER GIRLS WHO MAKE FUN OF HER. MAKE FUN OF ME? WHO MAKES FUN OF ME? WHO WAS TALKING BAD ABOUT ME, MANDY? PARIS HAS THE RIGHT TO KNOW WHO SPOKE BADLY ABOUT HER. THERE IS BASSANT. BASSANT, YOU TOLD ME, "I HOPE I'M ON ONE OR TWO EPISODES..." - EXACTLY. - BECAUSE YOU'RE HERE FOR YOURSELF. - AT LEAST I SAID IT. - THAT'S NOT A GOOD THING THOUGH. AT LEAST I SAID I'M HERE TO HELP MY CAREER WHEN I CAME AT THE BEGINNING. WHEN I SAT WITH HER LATER, I FOUND THAT SHE'S A REAL PERSON. AND I TOLD HER THAT IN FRONT OF HER FACE. BUT AT THE BEGINNING ALSO I TOLD HER THAT I'M HERE FOR MY CAREER. I NEVER LIED ABOUT THIS. - WHO ELSE? - THERE'S CHRISTY. SHE ASKED ME TO MAKE ME LOOK BAD. - NO ONE ASKED HER. - I IMITATE. THAT'S WHAT I DO. I LIKE TO HAVE FUN. YOU ARE SAYING THAT SHE WAS SARCASTIC? - THEY BEGGED ME TO DO IT. - SHE'S SARCASTIC, WHICH IS NO GOOD. THEY BEGGED ME ALL DAY TO DO IT... "PLEASE, PLEASE DO IT." STAND UP AND DO IT. THANK YOU. I'M GONNA DO IT. - I REALLY DON'T MEAN ANYTHING BAD. - SURE SURE. HI, GIRLS. - OKAY. - THAT'S WHAT I DO. THAT'S IT. WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT WALK? IT'S SEXY. THANK YOU. CAN I KISS YOU? OKAY, NOW IT'S TIME FOR THE FAKEST GIRLS IN THE HOUSE. SO IT'S EITHER DINA OR MANDY. THE MOST FAKE GIRL IN THE HOUSE IS... CONGRATULATIONS, MISS FAKE. DINA. YOU'RE THE FAKEST GIRL IN THE PENTHOUSE. OUR PICTURES CAME UP ON THE VERY FAKE SIDE... ME AND DINA... DINA BEING THE FAKEST AND ME BEING THE SECOND FAKEST. IT WAS PRETTY HARSH TO SEE THAT JUST BECAUSE BASSANT DIDN'T LIKE DINA AND SO SHE BRAINWASHED MOST OF THE GIRLS. AND BECAUSE I'M LIVING WITH DINA, THEY STARTED DISLIKING ME TOO. THE REAL-FAKE CHALLENGE CREATED A LOT OF DRAMA AND BASSANT'S STATEMENT ABOUT DINA CREATED A HUGE FIGHT BETWEEN THEM. YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO TALK TO ME YESTERDAY. I KNOW SHE'S GONNA TRY TO GIVE ME SOME TALK ABOUT, "NO, THIS AND THAT." NO NO NO, I WANT YOU TO DO IT IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA. NO NO NO, DON'T SIT THERE AND LIE. NO NO NO, I'M NOT. I'M NOT, I'M NOT, I'M NOT. YOU'RE NOT LYING? I'M NOT ACTING. I'M NOT ACTING. I SAID IT ON CAMERA IN FRONT OF EVERYONE. YOU GAVE ME A LOOK AND ATTITUDE AND YOU SAID, - "I'M NOT GONNA TALK TO YOU..." - "I'LL TALK TO YOU TOMORROW." - SO I CAME HERE TO TALK TO YOU. - NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU SAID. - WHAT DO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT? - THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU SAID. - OKAY, I WANT TO TALK TO YOU NOW. - I'M NOT GONNA TELL YOU. OH, YOU'RE TOO SCARED TO TALK? WHEN SHE CAME TO MY ROOM, I DIDN'T SEE THE CAMERA. I WAS TALKING TO HER NORMALLY BECAUSE I THOUGHT MAYBE SHE WAS POSSIBLY ANGRY OR WHATEVER. AND THEN SHE WAS LIKE, "YEAH, YOU WANTED TO TALK TO ME LAST NIGHT. TALK TO ME NOW." EXCUSE ME, DINA, YESTERDAY YOU DON'T WANT TO TALK TO ME AND GAVE ME AN ATTITUDE. BUT NOW BECAUSE AGAIN THE CAMERA IS ON, SHE WANTS TO TALK. YOU SAID I'M DIFFERENT OFF AND ON CAMERA, SO EVERY TIME I TALK TO YOU IT'S GONNA BE ON CAMERA FROM NOW ON. THAT'S WHY LAST NIGHT WHEN YOU WANTED TO TALK TO ME, I SAID... LOOK, YOU'RE SCARED. LOOK AT HER CLOSING THE DOOR. SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU'RE FAKE AND YOU CAN'T REPLY. YOU SEE, BECAUSE YOU'RE FAKE YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO REACT TO THIS SITUATION. IF YOU WANT TO TALK... "I CAME TO BE FAMOUS. I CAME ON THE SHOW TO BE FAMOUS AND BE A SINGER. I DON'T CARE ABOUT PARIS." I'M NOT GONNA EVEN TALK TO YOU. "I DON'T CARE ABOUT PARIS. I'LL SAY IT TO HER FACE." SO WHY DON'T YOU SAY IT TO THE CAMERA TO PARIS RIGHT NOW? YOU SAID YOU'D SAY IT TO HER FACE. SHE WANTS TO TELL EVERYONE THAT SHE HAS THE PERSONALITY, SHE'S THE QUEEN OF THE HOUSE, SHE CAN TALK, SHE CAN FIGHT, SHE CAN DO WHATEVER SHE WANTS. SHE CAN TALK ABOUT PEOPLE, BY THE WAY, BUT SHE DOESN'T ACCEPT PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT HER. IF YOU WERE REALLY HONEST, YOU'D TALK TO ME LAST NIGHT. BUT NOT TELLING ME, "OH, EXCUSE ME, I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR YOU. I'LL TALK TO YOU TOMORROW IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA." - YOU'RE THE QUEEN OF DRAMA. BUT NOT LIKE THIS... - NO NO NO. I WANT EVERYONE TO SEE HOW FAKE YOU ARE. - ME? - I WANT EVERYONE TO SEE HOW FAKE YOU ARE. - EXCUSE ME, EXCUSE ME. - THAT'S WHY. TO SIT THERE AND MAKE ALL THIS B.S. JUST MAKES YOU LOOK STUPID. YESTERDAY YOU SAID I'M DIFFERENT OFF AND ON CAMERA. YESTERDAY I CAME AND WALKED IN YOUR ROOM, SAID GOOD MORNING AND DID YOUR HAIR. WHY? AFTER I TOOK THE LITTLE... I DID YOUR HAIR THE FIRST DAY I MET YOU, YOU LIAR. EXCUSE ME, DON'T SAY I'M A LIAR AND RESPECT YOURSELF. I DID YOUR HAIR THE FIRST DAY I MET YOU. DON'T SAY I'M A LIAR. LOOK, THAT'S ALL SHE HAS TO SAY. - YOU'RE UNRESPECTABLE. - "DON'T SAY I'M A LIAR." I'M SORRY, DINA, DON'T COME TO MY ROOM NOW, FIGHT WITH ME, TELL ME I'M FAKE. SORRY. YOU CAN GO CHECK WITH THE REST OF THE GIRLS IN THE HOUSE, GET ME ONE GIRL TO TELL YOU THAT I'M FAKE. I THINK THAT BASSANT IS FAKE. WHEN WE CAME TO THE HOUSE, YOU NEVER CAME TO MY ROOM. - WHY YESTERDAY... - I NEVER CAME TO YOUR ROOM? - YEAH, ONLY YESTERDAY... - I SAID, "WHERE'S BRANKA?" I CAME AND SAID, "GOOD MORNING. WHERE'S BRANKA?" "BRANKA'S NOT HERE." SO SUDDENLY I BECAME YOUR FRIEND, YOU CAME TO MY ROOM TO DRY MY HAIR? WHO SAID I'M YOUR FRIEND? DON'T SIT HERE AND TRY TO ACT LIKE I'M FAKE. I DON'T CARE IF I'M NOT YOUR FRIEND. I COULD CARE LESS ABOUT YOU. - IF YOU DON'T CARE THEN WHY ARE YOU SO UPSET? - THE ONLY REASON WHY... WE'RE ALL IN THE HOUSE LIVING TOGETHER. BUT DON'T SIT HERE AND TELL ME I'M FAKE. I'M THE REALEST OUT OF EVERYBODY HERE. IT'S NOT TRUE THAT DINA BEHIND THE VIDEO, SHE'S NOT TALKING WITH THE GIRLS, SHE'S NOT IN TOUCH WITH US. IT'S BASSANT THAT'S NOT TALKING WITH THE OTHER GIRLS. AND SHE'S TALKING WITH ME JUST BECAUSE I'M SLEEPING WITH HER. YOU JUST WANT TO TALK, SEE? YOU DON'T WANT TO LISTEN TO ANYONE. YOU JUST WANT TO TALK. OH MY GOD. ALL RIGHT, BUDDY. ALL THE TRUE COLORS ARE GONNA COME OUT. AND YOU'RE FAKE BECAUSE YOU SAID YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT PARIS, YOU'RE ONLY HERE TO BECOME FAMOUS. THAT'S WHY I TOLD PARIS EVERYTHING? YEAH EXACTLY! YOU EVEN SAID IT TO PARIS'S FACE. THAT'S HOW FAKE YOU ARE. - THAT MEANS I'M FAKE... - SO WHY DON'T YOU GO ON "AMERICAN IDOL"? WHY DON'T YOU GO ON "AMERICAN IDOL"? WHY ARE YOU HERE ON "PARIS'S BFF IN DUBAI"? YOU'RE ON THE WRONG SHOW, SWEETHEART. I'M NOT YOUR... SWEETHEART. - COMING UP... - BECAUSE I'M A MODEL THAT YOU GUYS WANT TO USE... IT'S NOT BECAUSE YOU'RE A MODEL. FARHANA, YOU'RE SO LUCKY YOU'RE IN THIS HOUSE BECAUSE I WOULD SLAP THE... OUT OF YOU IF YOU WERE OUTSIDE THIS DOOR. I HATE HER. I LOATHE HER AND I WANT HER OUT OF THIS HOUSE. - AND LATER... - "I WANT TO BE FAMOUS. I COULD BE A FAMOUS GIRL." I COULD BE YOUR FRIEND... ABOUT YOU GUYS BEING IN THE SAME INDUSTRY. ...YOU. SHE'S NOT NORMAL. SHE ALL THE TIME CONFRONT ME, ALL THE TIME, LIKE SHE WANT TO FIGHT WITH ME. DINA AND BASSANT'S FIGHT GOT PRETTY HEATED AND THAT REINFORCED WHAT I ALREADY KNEW FROM THE BEGINNING... THAT BASSANT WAS A HUNGRY TIGER. - HOW ARE YOU FIRST? GOOD? - GOOD. I KNOW YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY I'M HERE TODAY AND WHY I'M GONNA BE YOUR BEST FRIEND. I WANT TO BE HER BEST FRIEND BECAUSE I WORK AS A TV PRESENTER. BUT WHEN YOU KNOW FAMOUS PEOPLE FROM HOLLYWOOD, IT'S GONNA OPEN A LOT OF DOORS FOR MY CAREER. THAT'S IT. OF COURSE I DON'T KNOW YOU... I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT YOU, SO I'M NOT GONNA SAY, "I LOVE YOU, PARIS. I'M CRAZY ABOUT YOU." THIS IS GONNA BE THE BEST THING HAPPEN TO ME. I MEAN, AS A TV PRESENTER AND IN MY CAREER, I FEEL LIKE "WHOO" NOW. BASSANT TOLD ME, "I HOPE I'M ON ONE OR TWO EPISODES." - EXACTLY. - "THAT'S IT. I'M HERE FOR..." SO WHY DOES YOUR OPINION EVEN COUNT? AT LEAST I SAID I'M HERE TO HELP MY CAREER WHEN I CAME AT THE BEGINNING. WHEN I SAT WITH HER LATER, I FOUND THAT SHE'S A REAL PERSON. AND I TOLD HER THAT IN FRONT OF HER FACE. BUT AT THE BEGINNING ALSO I TOLD HER THAT I'M HERE FOR MY CAREER. I NEVER LIED ABOUT THIS. YOU ADMITTED YOU'RE A HUNGRY TIGER AND YOU'RE HERE TO FURTHER YOUR CAREER. - OF COURSE. - DO YOU REALLY WANT TO BE MY FRIEND OR A CELEBRITY? WHEN I CAME TO THE SHOW I REALLY WANTED TO BE CELEBRITY. I AM IN MIDDLE EAST, BUT I WANTED MORE OF COURSE. THAT'S WHY I SAID IT FROM THE BEGINNING. BUT AS I SAID BEFORE, IF I WANTED TO BE YOUR FRIEND, I NEED TO KNOW YOU MORE. WHEN I KNEW YOU MORE, I'LL DECIDE THEN... VERY SIMPLE. THIS IS ME AND THIS IS MY PERSONALITY. AND OF COURSE I DIDN'T COME TO THIS SHOW BECAUSE I KNEW PARIS FROM 15 OR 20 YEARS. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? FOR ME YOU'RE A CELEBRITY. AND FOR ME YOU HAVE THIS SHOW AND YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A BEST FRIEND. MAYBE LATER WE CAN AFTER I KNOW YOU, AFTER YOU KNOW ME. I'M JUST NOT SURE ABOUT YOU. TELL ME WHY YOU SHOULD BE MY BFF. WHY I WANT TO BE YOUR BEST FRIEND? I SAID IT AND I WAS VERY HONEST. I AM THE ONLY HUNGRY TIGER IN THE HOUSE, BUT AT LEAST WHEN I CAME TO THIS SHOW IT COULD BE VERY EASY FOR ME TO TELL YOU, "PARIS, I LOVE YOU. I'D LOVE TO BE LIKE YOU," WHATEVER. BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO DO THIS BECAUSE THIS IS NOT ME. ALL I WANTED FROM THIS SHOW FROM THE BEGINNING IS TO COME AND TO HELP MY CAREER. IT'S FOR ME AND FOR MY MOM TOO. BUT I NEED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT YOU, YOU NEED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT ME. AND AT THE END OF THE DAY, IT'S OUR DECISION. THAT'S IT. RAR! HUNGRY. SO BASSANT WAS CLEARLY A HUNGRY TIGER AND DID NOTHING TO HIDE IT. BUT ONE GIRL WHO SAID HOW IT WAS WAS AMY. YOU CAN ALWAYS COUNT ON HER FOR THE TRUTH. ALL THE GIRLS ARE MESSY... ALL OF THEM. THEY'RE ALL DISGUSTING. - A SNEAKY BUNCH OF GIRLS. - FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE. "OH, LET ME DO YOUR HAIR. LET ME FIX YOUR MAKEUP. OH, YOU CAN BORROW MY PURSE." BLAH BLAH BLAH. AS IF! "TRUE OF FALSE, I GOT MY LIPS DONE." I HAD MY CHEEKBONES DONE. TRUE. - FALSE. DO I HAVE FAKE BREASTS? - - NO. "TRUE OR FALSE, I GOT A BOOB JOB." LIKE, EW, WHO CARES? AND, LIKE, THAT'S SO UNLADYLIKE TO TALK ABOUT YOUR FEATURES AND, LIKE, IF THEY'RE REAL OR NOT. LIKE EW. YOU SAID, "I DON'T TALK LIKE THIS" AT 2:30 IN THE MORNING. - WHAT? - THIS IS HOW YOU IMITATED ME. I HAVE A HARD TIME, LIKE, PRETENDING LIKE I CARE ABOUT PEOPLE. AMY SAYS IT HOW IT IS. SHE'S BEEN SAYING EVERYTHING THAT'S BEEN GOING ON IN THIS HOUSE EXACTLY HOW IT IS. "PARIS, YO YO, ME AND YOU CAN, LIKE, CHILL AND WE'RE COOL AND WHATEVER." LIKE HUH? IT'S ONE THING TO SPEAK YOUR MIND LIKE AMY DID, BUT WHEN YOU SAY THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN, YOU MIGHT BE CONSIDERED PRETTY ANNOYING LIKE FARHANA WAS. - MOST ANNOYING. - OH, WHAT YOU THINK, GROUP? ACTUALLY, I'M SORRY, I ACTUALLY DO FIND FARHANA ANNOYING. I FIND YOU ANNOYING SO I'LL GIVE IT TO YOU. THERE IS MORE ANNOYING GIRLS IN THE HOUSE. BUT THERE'S A LOT OF GIRLS HERE WHO ARE JEALOUS AND WHO ARE JUST GONNA PUT THE OTHER GIRLS DOWN. I SOMETIMES FIND YOU ANNOYING HOW YOU GO ON ABOUT THINGS. AND YOU REPEAT THE SAME THING LIKE SIX TIMES IN ONE SENTENCE. I CANNOT STAND HER. SHE IS ANNOYING. I WILL NOT TAKE THAT BECAUSE THAT IS NOT ME. FARHANA ANNOYING PEOPLE BECAUSE SHE'S SPEAKING TOO MUCH, MENTIONING ONE THING 10 TIMES. I COME FROM A VERY RESPECTABLE FAMILY. - I REALLY COME FROM A VERY VERY HUMBLE HOME. - I COME FROM A GOOD HOME. "I COME FROM A GOOD FAMILY. I COME FROM A GOOD FAMILY." SAY THE SAME THING EIGHT TIMES. MAYBE YOU'LL KEEP BRAINWASHING PEOPLE. - I'M NOT HERE AS A HUNGRY TIGER. - I'M NOT A HUNGRY TIGER. I DON'T LIKE THE WORD "HUNGRY TIGER." IT'S NOT LIKE I'M A HUNGRY TIGER. I'M NOT HERE AS A HUNGRY TIGER. RAR! CLEARLY THE GIRLS HAD DEVELOPED PRETTY STRONG OPINIONS ABOUT EACH OTHER. AND THE SASH CHALLENGE BROUGHT IT ALL OUT. - OH YEAH. - TWO-FACED. AH! THE FIRST ONE WHICH WAS PULLED OUT, IT WAS A TWO-FACED. - I THINK AMY IS. - SO ARE YOU! DO YOU GUYS THINK I'M TWO-FACED? - WE'RE JUST EXPRESSING... - OKAY, BUT I'M SAYING SOMETHING. I'M SAYING FROM WHAT I SAW. MOST SELF-CENTERED. I THINK AMY IS SELF-CENTERED BECAUSE SHE'S LIKE, "I DON'T CARE ABOUT ANYONE." THAT'S OKAY, I DON'T MIND THIS ONE. I'M SO SELF-CENTERED I DON'T CARE. BIGGEST TROUBLEMAKER. - YOU ARE! - SHE IS. SHE'S THE BIGGEST TROUBLEMAKER. - YES. MANDY. - YEAH, MANDY. WHY AM I NAUGHTY? - HOTTEST. - I THINK DINA. DINA. MOANER? - THAT'S GELAREH. - GELAREH. HUNGRY TIGER? OF COURSE IT WAS YOU. DON'T EVEN LOOK AT ME BECAUSE I PROVED MYSELF... RAR! I'M SORRY, BUT I WILL NOT EVEN ACCEPT THAT. "I'M A MODEL. I'M A MODEL. I'M A MODEL. BUT I NEVER TALK ABOUT MY CAREER. BUT I'M A MODEL... AND MY CAREER, MY CAREER, MY CAREER." - I DIDN'T SAY THAT... - "MY BOYFRIEND'S CAREER." I DIDN'T SAY I CAME HERE TO GET FAMOUS. YES, EVERYONE HAS... EVERYONE IS CAREER-MINDED. AND I'M SORRY, I AM CAREER-MINDED, BUT I DIDN'T SAY TO ANYONE THAT I CAME ON THE SHOW TO GET FAMOUS. SO I WILL NOT TAKE THAT BECAUSE THAT IS NOT ME. A HUNGRY TIGER IS SOMEONE WHO CAME ON THE SHOW TO GET... TO GET TO PARIS, TO LIVE HER LIFESTYLE, TO GET THE FAME. AND I'M NOT HERE FOR THAT. I SPOKE THE TRUTH AND I WILL NOT TAKE THAT BECAUSE I AM NOT A HUNGRY TIGER. PARIS WILL SOON FIND OUT THAT AND SHE'LL BACK ME UP. OKAY, WE HEARD YOU. BECAUSE I'M A MODEL THAT YOU GUYS WANT TO USE... IT'S NOT BECAUSE YOU'RE A MODEL! - YES, THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID. - IT'S NOT BECAUSE YOU'RE A MODEL. BRANKA IS A MODEL. EVERYBODY HAS DONE MODELING. SO WHAT IF I TALK ABOUT MY CAREER? IT'S THE ONLY THING THAT COMES OUT OF YOUR MOUTH. I DIDN'T COME HERE TO GET FAMOUS. A HUNGRY TIGER IS SOMEONE WHO CAME HERE TO GET FAMOUS. I DON'T THINK THAT I SHOULD TAKE A SASH WHICH I DON'T DESERVE. AND IF I'M NOT A HUNGRY TIGER, I WON'T ACCEPT IT. WE'LL SOON FIND OUT. "WE'LL SOON FIND OUT." LIKE IT'S A THREAT OR SOMETHING. LIKE IT'S A THREAT. YOU'RE SO LUCKY... FARHANA, YOU'RE SO LUCKY YOU'RE IN THIS HOUSE, BECAUSE I WOULD SLAP THE... OUT OF YOU IF YOU WERE OUTSIDE THIS DOOR. BECAUSE YOU ARE CRAZY! I HATE HER. I LOATHE HER AND I WANT HER OUT OF THIS HOUSE. I NEVER WANT TO SEE HER AGAIN. I'M NOT A LIAR! STOP SAYING THAT! I CAN HEAR YOU. IF I WANTED TO BE A... LIKE HER, I COULD TURN AROUND AND SWEAR AND TELL HER I'LL SLAP YOU AT THE SAME TIME. THIS GIRL... I HATE HER. WOW, FARHANA AND AMY REALLY HAD IT OUT. BUT MAYBE THEIR FRUSTRATION STARTED MUCH EARLIER WHEN THEY GOT PARTNERED UP TO DO THE COMMERCIAL CHALLENGE. ACTION. WHAT ARE YOU WEARING? I'M WEARING THE NEW PARIS HILTON SHOES. OH, YOU LOOK AMAZING. IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU'RE HOT; IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU'RE NOT, AS LONG AS YOU'RE WEARING PARIS HILTON SHOES. INTRODUCING PARIS HILTON COLLECTION TO THE MIDDLE EAST. OKAY. I WOULD NEVER EVER AIR THAT COMMERCIAL IN A MILLION YEARS. READY AND ACTION. * DAMN DAMN... * DAMN DAMN DAMN DAMN... DAMN, WHAT'S THE FIRST THING YOU NOTICE ON A WOMAN? HER HUGE BAG. - EXCUSE ME, MA'AM. SORRY. - HI. I JUST, I HEAR AND I SEE AND I KNOW THAT MIDDLE EASTERNERS ARE KNOWN FOR THEIR HOT TASTE IN BAGS. PLEASE TELL ME WHERE YOU GOT THAT FROM. I GOTTA HAVE IT FOR MY WIFE. THIS... THIS IS A PARIS HILTON BAG. EVERYBODY WANTS IT AND EVERYBODY CAN HAVE IT. IT'S AVAILABLE IN FESTIVAL CITY. - I LOVE IT, I LOVE IT. - I KNOW. - THANK YOU SO MUCH. AS-SALAMU ALAYKUM. THANK YOU. - YOU'RE WELCOME. TA-TA. * DAMN DAMN DAMN DAMN. I THOUGHT THE LAST ONE WAS BAD. THAT WAS EVEN WORSE. CAMERAS ROLLING. ONE, TWO, THREE, ACTION. EXCUSE ME. THAT'S A GORGEOUS WATCH. THANK YOU. IT'S A GLAMOROUS WATCH AND AT THE SAME TIME IT CAN BE A BRACELET. THAT'S WHY I LOVE IT. WOW. AH, IT'S PARIS HILTON. YEAH. IT'S HUGE. SO AFTER WATCHING ALL THE COMMERCIALS, THE WINNING TEAM IS THE WATCH TEAM. WOW, THAT WAS ROUGH. LET'S GET BACK TO THE JUICY STUFF... THE FASHION CHALLENGE, MY FAVORITE. COME ON, COME ON. PERSONAL STYLE IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME. MY BFF SHOULD KNOW WHAT I LIKE... SHE LOVES DIAMONDS. SHE LOVES DIAMONDS. ...AND WHAT I WOULDN'T BE CAUGHT DEAD IN. IF YOU DON'T MIND, I THINK THAT I'M MUCH MORE SKINNY AND BLONDE LIKE PARIS, SO IF YOU DON'T MIND, I WANT TO MODEL. OKAY, BUT I'M... ALL RIGHT. WHATEVER. WE WANT SOMETHING LIKE... YOU KNOW? SOMETHING WITH... I NEED PANTS. YEAH, THAT'S GREAT. - BUT LET'S TRY... - NO, THIS IS... I CHOSE. SHE CHOSE THE OTHER ONE. - SO SO... - I CHOSE THE PURSE. NOW WE'RE GONNA CHOOSE THE ONE OF THE TWO OUTFITS. SO I'M GONNA TRY THE NEXT OUTFIT. I THOUGHT THE FIRST OPTION WHICH IS THE DRESS IS SO PARIS BECAUSE OF THE BLING-BLING - AND THE COLORS. - WHAT IS SHE SAYING? WHAT IS SHE SAYING? YOU'RE HEARING ME. AREN'T YOU HEARING ME? - NO, I'M NOT HEARING YOU. - OKAY. I SAID I PICKED THESE TWO OUTFITS AND YOU PICKED THE ACCESSORIES, OKAY? THIS ONE. AND THEN YOU SAID THIS ONE IS SO PARIS. WE SAW A LOT OF OPTIONS. OKAY? WE SAW A LOT OF OPTIONS AND I PICKED. BECAUSE WE BOTH WERE SEARCHING FOR THINGS. AND YOU KNOW THE STYLE I WAS LOOKING FOR. YOU WANTED THAT... OKAY, I'M GONNA TRY THEM ON. - YOU DON'T HAVE TO TRY... - WE DIDN'T PICK YET. WE DIDN'T PICK YET. - EXACTLY. - OKAY, SO WE DIDN'T DO... WE DIDN'T MAKE THE DECISIONS YET. OKAY, ARE YOU GONNA TRY THE OTHER ONE? BUT WHEN WE DO THE DECISION, WE START... SWEETIE, THEY ASKED ME, OKAY? STOP TRYING TO BE FUSSY. GIRLS, DON'T FIGHT. - WELL... - I LOVE YOU. LITTLE BRANKY WAS PRETTY FUNNY AND CAREFREE. BUT BE CAREFUL IF YOU PUSH HER BUTTONS. - - HI. HI. I THINK THAT YOU KNOW HOW TO ENJOY IN THE LIFE... HOW TO LIVE THE LIFE AND I WANT YOU TO SHOW ME. - WHERE ARE YOU FROM? - CROATIA... I TELL YOU ALREADY. YOU ARE NOT LISTENING TO ME, EH? OH SORRY. PARIS, ME AND YOU WILL BE THE BEST FRIEND FOREVER. WAS THAT A MAN? "PARIS, I DON'T THINK YOU'RE LISTENING." THE ACCENT. - YOU HAVE BRANKA. - YES. - THE DUDE? - YEAH. RELAX, IT'S ME... IT'S BRANKA. STOP. PRESS THE BRAKES. - SORRY! - GIVE ME WHIPLASH. I'M GONNA MODEL IT. DANA, WHEEL OF A TIDE. WHALE! WHALE OF THE TIDE. WHALE OF THE TIDE. DANA, YOU'RE "HOLE" OF THE TIDE. WHALE! - WHAT? - WHALE. A WHALE... LIKE A WHALE IN THE WATER. GELAREH, SHARK BITE. - BAIT. - SHARK BAIT. GELAREH, I PUT YOU SHARK... LIKE SHARK BITE BECAUSE YOU ARE DELICIOUS. THANK YOU. TRUE OR FALSE, UM, I USED TO BE A MAN. THIS ONE MADE ME CLAP. - THAT'S FALSE. - FALSE. OF COURSE FALSE. THAT'S TRUE. PARIS, WHAT DO YOU THINK? FALSE. WHAT DO YOU REALLY THINK? FALSE OF COURSE. I AUDITIONED... I EXPLAINED THAT I WANT TO BE HER BEST FRIEND FOREVER AND I'M ALWAYS SAYING THAT I WANT TO WIN AT THIS. I DON'T HAVE ANY... IF I WANT TO BE FAMOUS, I COULD BE FAMOUS. I COULD GO IN HOLLYWOOD. I THINK THAT I CAN... SOMETHING TO DO, THAT I HAVE TALENT. HOW COME YOU NEVER... HOW COME YOU NEVER DEFENDED HER? - I'M NOT... - HOW COME YOU NEVER DEFENDED HER? YOU'RE A MODEL TOO. HOW COME YOU NEVER SAID, "I UNDERSTAND"? WHY I NEED DEFEND HER? SHE'S NOT MY FRIEND. - YOU'RE FAKE. - NO! I'M NOT GOING TO DEFEND HER. IT'S NOT ABOUT BEING A FRIEND. IT'S ABOUT YOU GUYS BEING IN THE SAME INDUSTRY. YOU NEVER ONCE DEFENDED HER AND SAID, "LOOK, PARIS, I'M A MODEL TOO AND I'M NOT HERE TO BE ANYTHING ELSE BUT A FRIEND." - YOU NEVER DEFENDED HER... - I'M NOT IN THE SAME... SAME LIKE HER. - YOU'RE A MODEL, ARE YOU NOT? - SO WHAT IF I MODEL? - FARHANA, WHAT ARE YOU? - I'M A MODEL TOO. - SAME INDUSTRY. - ...YOU. GELAREH, SHE'S NOT NORMAL. SHE ALL THE TIME CONFRONT ME, ALL THE TIME, LIKE SHE WANT TO FIGHT WITH ME ALL THE TIME, ALL THE TIME. COMING UP... CAN I JUST LEAVE? - DALILA. - I LEAVE HER. - NO. - I PACK UP AND LEAVE HER, I THINK I WOULD BE VERY HAPPY. LOOK AT YOUR CLOTHES AND LOOK AT MINE. - EXCUSE ME? YOU'RE INSULTING ME? - BECAUSE YOU INSULTED ME. - AND LATER... - SO THIS IS MY FINAL FOUR. NOW I'VE GOT THIS FAR IN THE COMPETITION, I DON'T KNOW HOW I COULD ACCEPT NOT WINNING. I DON'T THINK THIS TV IS BIG ENOUGH TO SAY HOW MUCH I WANNA WIN. SO IT'S A LOT. WHEN IT WAS DOWN TO SIX GIRLS, I KNEW I HAD TO BE COMFORTABLE WITH MY BFF ON THE RED CARPET. SO I CAME UP WITH THE PERFECT CHALLENGE. WALKING DOWN THE RED CARPET WITH PARIS WAS A GLIMPSE OF WHAT HER LIFE IS LIKE EVERY DAY. AT THE BEGINNING, I WAS KIND OF NERVOUS WALKING WITH PARIS. BUT SHE WAS SMILING SO SHE GAVE ME A GOOD SPIRIT. REEM, HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE PARIS'S NEW BFF? I'M SO EXCITED TO BE PARIS'S NEW BFF AND I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE. WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE AS FAMOUS AS PARIS? UM... UH, MAYBE NOT AS FAMOUS AS PARIS, NO. EVERYTHING THAT YOU GUYS READ ABOUT HER IS NOT TRUE. SHE'S AMAZING. GELAREH, WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE AS FAMOUS AS PARIS? OF COURSE NOT. I HAVE MY OTHER PLANS. - DID YOU ENJOY PARTYING IN BEIRUT? - I LOVED IT. BEIRUT IS AMAZING AND THE WEATHER IS AMAZING. I WAS VERY COMFORTABLE. I DIDN'T FEEL SHY OR SCARED OR NERVOUS. IT WAS... I'VE DONE A LOT OF RED-CARPET EVENTS BEFORE. IT WASN'T MY FIRST TIME, SO... WHAT IS ONE THING WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT PARIS? I GUESS YOU KNOW EVERYTHING... SHE'S SWEET, SHE'S NICE. SHE'S EVERYTHING YOU SEE. SHE'S REAL. PARIS IS ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL WOMEN ON THE PLANET. WHY DOES SHE NEED YOU, DINA? WELL, IF SHE WANTS A REALLY TRUSTWORTHY FRIEND THAT SHE CAN REALLY TRUST AND HAVE FUN WITH AND NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT HER HAVING BAD INTENTIONS TOWARDS HER OR ANYTHING THAT SHE'S DOING WITH HER LIFE, THAT'S WHAT I'M HERE FOR. DANA, HOW DO YOU FEEL TO BE PARIS'S NEW BFF? UM, I'M SPEECHLESS. UM, I'M NOT USED TO THIS KIND OF CAMERAS EVERYWHERE AND EVERYTHING. IT WAS REALLY DIFFICULT HAVING ALL THESE QUESTIONS THROWN AT ME, AND I'M SOMEONE WHO USUALLY WORKS QUITE WELL UNDER PRESSURE. ARE YOU STRONG ENOUGH FOR HOLLYWOOD THEN? OH, I'M STRONG ENOUGH FOR ANYTHING. I'VE BEEN TO HOLLYWOOD BEFORE. I LOOK SOFT BUT PEOPLE HAVE DESCRIBED ME AS A TWIX BAR... SOFT ON THE OUTSIDE BUT HARD AND CRUNCHY ON THE INSIDE. POOR DANA'S SO NERVOUS. I KNOW SHE DOESN'T THINK SHE'S A CANDY BAR. REEM, YOU'RE FROM KUWAIT. WHO'S RICHER, YOU OR PARIS? UM, SHE IS. FOR SURE. IT'S ALMOST TIME FOR ME TO MAKE THE BIG DECISION AND CHOOSE MY NEW BFF. BUT BEFORE I DO, I WANNA TAKE ONE LAST LOOK AT MY LITTLE GELAREH. TEAM B... DANA, DALILA, "GELARIA" AND REEM. GELAREH. "GALARIA," HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE PARIS'S... WOW, MY NAME IS GELAREH. IT'S GELAREH. YOU CAN ASK, LIKE, "GELARIA." I'LL COME AND JOKE... - SOME PEOPLE... - GELAREH. I KNOW. I WANT TO CALL YOU GELARIA. GALERIA AND... GALERLELA. GORILLA. GALERIA... HUGE. SHE ALSO LOVES TO EAT. UH-HUH, UH-HUH. MMM. I MADE HUMMUS! LOOK. I HAD SO MANY POTENTIAL BFFs TO CHOOSE FROM. THEY WERE ALL GREAT. BUT I HAD A HARD TIME GETTING TO KNOW THEM AT FIRST. ALTHOUGH THEY ALL THOUGHT THEY KNEW ME REALLY WELL... PARIS WOULD NEVER WANT SOMEBODY AROUND HER WHO NOBODY'D LIKE. PARIS LOVES IT, YOU KNOW, WHEN IT'S ALL ABOUT GLITZ AND GLAMOUR AND, YOU KNOW, A LITTLE BIT OF DRAMA IN IT. PARIS IS PRETTY SHY. I THINK PARIS HILTON IS SMART. SHE'S SWEET, SHE'S NICE, BUT SHE'S SMART TOO. SHE'S NOT AN IDIOT. PARIS WOULD PREFER TO BE WITH SOMEONE A BIT MORE CLASSY THAN DALILA. SEEMS LIKE YOU DON'T KNOW ME AT ALL. RESPECT AND TRUST IS ALWAYS IMPORTANT IN EVERY CULTURE, ESPECIALLY HERE IN DUBAI. MY BODYGUARD MASON WOULD TAKE A BULLET FOR ME. I TRUST HIM WITH MY LIFE AND HE CAN SPOT A HUNGRY TIGER A MILE AWAY. SO I HAD HIM INTERROGATE THE GIRLS TO FIND OUT THEIR TRUE INTENTIONS. WHY ARE YOU HERE? TO BE PARIS'S BEST FRIEND. DOES FAME OR FORTUNE COME WITH THAT? NEITHER. WOULD YOU CHOOSE FAME OR WOULD YOU CHOOSE FORTUNE? - LIKE MONEY OR FAME? - YES. - MONEY. - YOU WOULD CHOOSE THE FORTUNE, THE MONEY? YEAH, I'D CHOOSE THE MONEY. IF I HAD TO CHOOSE, YEAH, I'D CHOOSE MONEY. - YOU'D CHOOSE THE MONEY. - YEAH. FAME OVER HERE, FORTUNE OVER HERE. WHICH ONE DO YOU CHOOSE IF YOU HAD A CHOICE? - HEALTH. - THAT WASN'T AN OPTION. - I WOULD GO WITH FORTUNE. - SURE. I'VE GOT FORTUNE AND I DON'T NEED FAME. - ALL RIGHT. - MMM. MAYBE ONE PERSON STICKS OUT IN MY MIND THAT'S GENUINE AND IS IN IT TO MEET PARIS. LET'S FIND OUT WHO MASON WOULD TAKE A BULLET FOR. LIKE HE WOULDN'T TAKE A BULLET FOR ME? AND I FELT KIND OF OFFENDED, LIKE, HE DOESN'T TRUST ME? I'M A GOOD PERSON. I DON'T HAVE NO BAD INTENTIONS. WHY WOULDN'T HE TRUST ME?" MASON. OH. I WAS DISAPPOINTED. I FELT THAT I DID ANSWER WELL. BUT MAYBE HE FELT UNSURE ABOUT ME. AH! NO. DOWN DOWN DOWN DOWN. AW! - YOU SAVED MY LIFE. - THAT WAS A DRIVE THROUGH PARIS SHOOTING. WE GOT SHOT. WE GOT SHOT UP. HAVING MASON INTERVIEW THE GIRLS WAS VERY HELPFUL. AND NOW I'M READY TO MAKE MY DECISION. AND MY NEW BFF IS... I'VE MET SOME AMAZING BFFs. ALL BUT FOUR HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED. THE GAME IS STARTING NOW. AND CUT CUT, YOU'RE OUT. CAN I JUST LEAVE? - DALILA. - I LEAVE HER. CAN I JUST MAKE MY OWN DECISION? - NO NO NO. - NO, SERIOUSLY. NO POINT. I DON'T HAVE TO... NO, IT WILL BE FINE IF I CAN JUST LEAVE AND LEAVE HER, AT LEAST I'LL KNOW MY FRIEND. I WANT MY GIRLFRIEND TO STAY ON THE SHOW. I WANT YOU TO STAY TOO, BUT... I WANT YOU TO STAY TOO. - COME ON, COME ON. - LIKE, I KNOW SHE'S REAL. SHE KNOWS I'M REAL. I WANT MY GIRLFRIEND TO BE ON THE SHOW. YOU TOO. COME ON. IF I PACK UP AND LEAVE HER, I THINK I WOULD BE VERY HAPPY. NO. AND I WOULDN'T. - WE'RE FRIENDS, RIGHT? - BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO LOSE FRIENDS. SO LET EVERYONE ELSE CHOOSE. LET'S KEEP IT LIKE THAT. WE'RE COOL WITH EACH OTHER. LET EVERYONE ELSE CHOOSE, ALL RIGHT? STAY WITH ME. LET EVERYONE ELSE CHOOSE. IT'S OKAY. WE'RE FRIENDS. DON'T LET WHAT ANYONE SAYS AFFECT THE WAY YOU FEEL. DON'T MAKE ME CRY NOW. COME ON NOW. EXACTLY. I DON'T WANT TO MESS UP MY MAKEUP. OKAY, I'VE HEARD ENOUGH AND I'VE COME TO MY DECISION. IT'S A REALLY HARD CHOICE TO MAKE BUT I CAN ONLY HAVE ONE TRUE BFF. AND IT WON'T BE DALILA. BYE-BYE. BRANKA, YOU'RE GREAT FUN. BUT YOUR AMAZING RECOVERY WHEN YOU HEARD THERE WAS A PARTY WORRIES ME. I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE NOT TAKING THIS SERIOUSLY. BASSANT, YOU'VE BEEN HONEST ABOUT USING ME TO FURTHER YOUR CAREER. BUT I'M NOT SURE IF YOU'D MAKE A GOOD BFF. IT'S A REALLY HARD CHOICE TO MAKE BUT I CAN ONLY HAVE ONE TRUE BFF. AND IT WON'T BE... BASSANT. MARTA, YOU'RE UP FOR DISCUSSION BECAUSE YOU HAVE A QUICK TEMPER AND THE SMALLEST THINGS SEEM TO MAKE YOU ANGRY. I DON'T NEED A FRIEND WHO HAS TANTRUMS. TELL ME WHY YOU SHOULD BE MY BFF. I KNOW THAT I HAVE A TEMPER TOO. IT'S PART OF MY CHARACTER. I'M... I AM WHAT I AM, SO... UM... I REALLY WANT TO... TO KNOW YOU. FARHANA, YOU'RE UP FOR DISCUSSION BECAUSE I'M REALLY NOT SURE OF YOUR MOTIVES. I ALSO FEEL LIKE I DON'T REALLY KNOW THE REAL YOU, LIKE YOU'RE NOT OPENING UP AND SHOWING WHO YOU REALLY ARE. I REALLY WANT TO BE YOUR FRIEND. YOU KNOW, I THINK WE REALLY COMPLEMENT ONE ANOTHER. AND IF YOU REALLY GET TO KNOW ME, YOU WOULD REALIZE THAT I'M NOTHING CLOSE TO WHAT PEOPLE MAKE ME OUT TO BE. AMY, WHO DO YOU THINK SHOULD GO? I JUST... I'M SORRY. I DON'T TRUST FARHANA'S WORDS. I KNOW GELAREH, YOU LOVE HER... YOU WANT TO SAY SOMETHING, BUT... I DON'T KNOW IF SHE'S A HUNGRY TIGER OR NOT, BUT SHE SURE IS A NAME-DROPPER. AND I KNOW NAME-DROPPERS ARE SOMETHING ELSE YOU DON'T LIKE. AND SHE TALKS A LOT ABOUT WHO SHE KNOWS IN BOLLYWOOD AND WHO SHE KNOWS IN HOLLYWOOD AND WHO HER BROTHER IS. AH! YOU HAD A CHANCE. AND I THINK SHE WOULD DO THE SAME THING IF SHE WAS FRIENDS WITH YOU. THAT'S WHAT I THINK ABOUT FARHANA. I DON'T THINK THAT'S WHAT I SAID. I WANTED TO EXPLAIN TO THEM THAT I AM NOT A HUNGRY TIGER. I HAVE BEEN OUT WITH PEOPLE THAT ARE CELEBRITIES, SO... AND WHY... THEY LIKE ME AS A FRIEND. WHY? I SAID YOU DROP NAMES. YOU DO DROP NAMES. I'M A REAL FRIEND. I'M NOT LIKE A STARSTRUCK PEOPLE... LIKE SOME OF THE GIRLS THAT ARE STARSTRUCK NOW. WHO IS? WHO IS STARSTRUCK? YOU KEEP SAYING THIS BUT YOU NEVER SAY WHO AND... THERE'S A LOT OF STARSTRUCK GIRLS OUT HERE. SAY WHO AND THEN TELL US WHY. SAY WHO AND TELL US WHY. I THINK YOU ARE STARSTRUCK. YOU'RE, LIKE, REALLY DESPERATE AND YOU LIKE... YOU KNOW, YOU'RE NOT SHOWING THE REAL YOU AS WELL. AND YOU'RE GONNA THINK I'M A HUNGRY TIGER BUT YOU DON'T KNOW ME. YOU'VE NOT EVEN SPENT ANY TIME WITH ME. SO WHERE IS THAT CONNECTION? LIKE, HOW ARE YOU TO GET TO KNOW WHO I REALLY AM? YES, LIKE I SAID, I'M VERY MISUNDERSTOOD. I COME ACROSS AS LIKE ALL MODEL, A DIVA. I HAVE HEARD ENOUGH AND I'VE COME TO MY DECISION. MARTA, I'M SORRY. THAT WAS ALL THE SECOND OUTFIT. I CHOSE THE FIRST ONE. - YOU DIDN'T CHOOSE THE FIRST ONE. - EXCUSE ME. - NO SWEETIE... - I SAID YES FOR THE DRESS. AND I TOOK IT. YOU CAN SEE THE TAPE AND YOU CAN SEE WHAT HAPPENED EXACTLY. I LIKE THIS ONE, OKAY, BUT WITH SOME NICE PANTS AND A HUGE BELT. - OKAY. - FIND ME PANTS. SHE DOESN'T... SHE BARELY WEAR PANTS. OOPS, I'M SO SORRY. - - IT'S GONNA LOOK GOOD. BELIEVE ME. - BECAUSE IT WAS ALL... - CHRISTY... DON'T SAY. - LISTEN TO ME. - CHRISTY... I'M SPEAKING. I HEARD YOU. - YOU HAVE TO HEAR ME NOW. - THERE'S CAMERAS, SWEETIE. THERE'S CAMERAS. I DON'T BELIEVE WHAT'S HAPPENING. - I HONESTLY FEEL SICK. - OKAY. WHEN I GOT THE DRESS, I TOLD HER, "THIS IS THE CHOICE. I'M GONNA GO FOR IT." SO SHE SAID NO. THE SECOND OUTFIT... SHE SAW YOUR PHOTO IN MAGAZINE... - I NEVER SAID... - SHE SAID YOU WERE WEARING THE SAME... OH MY GOD, YOU'RE LYING. YOU'RE LYING. YOU SAID I SAW HER IN A MAGAZINE? - IT'S ON VIDEO, SWEETIE. - IS IT ON YOUR MIND OR WHAT? I NEVER SAW HER WEARING THIS IN A MAGAZINE. - I TOLD PARIS WE ARE WORKING AS A TEAM. - SHE LOVES HER CHIHUAHUA. I TOLD YOU, PARIS... EXCUSE ME. SHE LOVES HER CHIHUAHUA AND I WISH THAT YOU BROUGHT JEANS. I SAID SHE LOVES HER CHIHUAHUA AND I WISH YOU BROUGHT SOME JEANS, CHRISTY. OKAY, SWEETIE? SO LISTEN. I TOLD YOU, PARIS. LOOK AT YOUR CLOTHES AND LOOK AT MINE. EXCUSE ME? YOU'RE INSULTING ME? - BECAUSE YOU INSULTED ME. - YOU'RE INSULTING ME? AND I DEFENDED YOU AND I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING. - WHO CHOSE THE CLOTHES? - I DIDN'T INSULT YOU. SO THIS IS... I CAN TELL HOW YOU ARE FROM YOUR PERSONALITY. - FINE. - VERY NOT RESPECTFUL GIRL. REEM, I THINK YOU'RE A GREAT GIRL, BUT YOU SEEM TO ALWAYS WANT YOUR OWN WAY AND THAT WORRIES ME. CHRISTY, YOU'RE ALWAYS CRYING. I'M CONCERNED YOU'RE TOO FRAGILE AND YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO COPE WITH MY WORLD. IT'S A REALLY HARD CHOICE TO MAKE BUT I CAN ONLY HAVE ONE TRUE BFF. AND IT WON'T BE... CHRISTY. I COULD HAVE BEEN LIKE SOME GIRLS AND REALLY FOUGHT BACK AND, YOU KNOW, SCREAM AND SHOUT AND CALL NAMES. BUT I WAS REALLY CALM AND COMPOSED BECAUSE THAT'S MY PERSONALITY. I WILL NEVER BELITTLE MYSELF NO MATTER FOR WHAT BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE MORALS MY FAM... MY PARENTS HAVE BROUGHT ME UP WITH. AND I DON'T THINK ANYONE HAS THE RIGHT TO START SWEARING AT ME AND TELLING ME, "IF YOU WERE NOT IN THE HOUSE I WOULD SLAP YOU. - I HATE YOU." - GIVE ME A BREAK THAT I LOST IT ONE TIME. IT DOESN'T MATTER. FARHANA, I'VE HEARD A LOT OF WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY. IT'S A REALLY HARD CHOICE TO MAKE BUT I CAN ONLY HAVE ONE TRUE BFF AND IT WON'T BE... FARHANA. PARIS WANTED ME TO SAY SHE CAN ONLY HAVE ONE TRUE BFF AND IT WON'T BE YOU. SHE HAS SENT YOU THIS MESSAGE: T.T.Y.N.... TALK TO YOU NEVER. GELAREH, I'M WORRIED THAT YOUR NEGATIVITY MIGHT DRAG ME DOWN. MANDY, YOU'RE GOOD FUN, BUT YOU SEEM MORE INTERESTED IN BEING A PARTY GIRL THAN MY FRIEND. AMY, I LOVE YOUR ENTHUSIASM, BUT SOMETIMES YOUR INTENSITY CAN BE TOO MUCH. IT'S A REALLY HARD CHOICE TO MAKE BUT I CAN ONLY HAVE ONE TRUE BFF AND IT WON'T BE... GELAREH. NOW I HAVE TO ELIMINATE ONE MORE GIRL. DANA, WHO DO YOU THINK SHOULD GO? UM, I'D HAVE TO SAY MANDY. YOU SHOULD HAVE HEARD WHAT SHE WAS SAYING ABOUT YOU YESTERDAY. EXCUSE ME? PLEASE DO SAY. YOU SAID, "I CAN'T STAND THE..." - I NEVER SAID THAT. - YEAH, YOU DID. - I NEVER SAID THAT. - YEAH, AND THEN YOU SAID BACK TO HER, "OH, YOU'VE BEEN MOANING AT ME ALL DAY. WHAT ABOUT YOU?" ARE YOU TRYING TO MAKE A FIGHT HERE, GIRL? - ABOUT HER? - YEAH. I WOULD NEVER SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THE GIRL I'M LIVING WITH - SO DON'T TRY TO BRING THIS UP, OKAY? - WHO ELSE WAS IN THE ROOM? OKAY, I'VE HEARD ENOUGH AND I'VE COME TO MY DECISION. I CAN ONLY HAVE ONE TRUE BFF AND IT WON'T BE... MANDY. AND NOW IT'S DOWN TO THE FINAL FOUR... AMY... I'M SO PROUD OF MYSELF TO COME THIS FAR. AND I'LL DO WHATEVER I CAN TO WIN. IN THE END OF THE DAY, THIS IS A COMPETITION. IN THE END OF THE DAY, YOU WILL PUT ANYBODY IN FRONT OF A BUS TO GET WHAT YOU WANT. YOU'RE SO LUCKY... FARHANA, YOU'RE SO LUCKY YOU'RE IN THIS HOUSE, BECAUSE I WOULD SLAP THE... OUT OF YOU IF YOU WERE OUTSIDE THIS DOOR. HOW MUCH DO I WANT TO BE PARIS'S BFF? I REALLY REALLY WANT TO BE HER FRIEND. I FEEL LIKE WE ALREADY ARE FRIENDS BUT I WANT TO BE HER REAL BEST FRIEND. ...REEM... PARIS IS A SWEET GIRL, GENUINE, AND SHE CAN SEE REALLY INTO PEOPLE AND SHE CAN TELL WHO'S REAL AND WHO'S NOT. I CAME SO FAR NOW TO THE END, AND I CAME ACTUALLY ALL THE WAY TO SEE PARIS AND MEET HER. SO I'M HERE TO WIN THIS. ...DINA... I CAME REALLY FAR IN THIS COMPETITION. I WANT TO BE YOUR FRIEND. I DON'T THINK THIS TV IS BIG ENOUGH TO SAY HOW MUCH I WANT TO WIN. SO IT'S A LOT. ...AND DANA. I'M FEELING SO ANXIOUS BECAUSE I KNOW IT'S NEAR THE END OF THE COMPETITION. I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN. NOW I'VE GOT THIS FAR, I DON'T KNOW HOW I COULD ACCEPT NOT WINNING. WHEN I CHOOSE TO DO SOMETHING, I PUT MY ALL INTO IT, I PUT MY HEART INTO IT. DANA, BECAUSE YOU'RE THE MOST REAL PERSON IN THE HOUSE, YOU WIN A LITTLE SURPRISE WITH ME. I GENUINELY BELIEVE THAT I COULD BE ONE OF THE BEST FRIENDS PARIS COULD GET. AND I DO THINK THAT I DESERVE TO WIN THIS. SO THIS IS MY FINAL FOUR. IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS, ONE OF YOU WILL BECOME MY NEW BFF IN DUBAI. I'M REALLY EXCITED AND I HOPE YOU ALL ARE TOO. THIS IS GOING TO BE THE HARDEST DECISION EVER. I'M GONNA NEED TO SLEEP ON THIS. SEE YOU LATER.
