 I'M PARIS HILTON. I'M IN DUBAI... TO ASK 12 GIRLS TO TAKE THE ULTIMATE FRIENDSHIP TEST. I DON'T THINK THIS TV IS BIG ENOUGH TO SAY HOW MUCH I WANNA WIN. I'M JUST LOOKING FOR SOMEONE WHO'S GENUINE, WHO'S REAL, SOMEONE WHO HAS A BIG HEART AND JUST SOMEONE I CAN TRUST. THEY'LL NEED TO KNOW HOW TO PARTY, SHOW ME THEY HAVE TASTE AND CLASS AND PROVE TO ME THAT THEY'RE REAL. YOU'RE A FAKE, AND EVERYBODY KNOWS IT!

 THEY'LL LIVE TOGETHER... IT'S CRAZIER THAN YOU CAN BELIEVE IT. ...AND COMPETE IN CHALLENGES THAT I SET. I GOT A TEXT MESSAGE. EACH WEEK, TWO WILL BE UP FOR DISCUSSION AND I'LL DECIDE WHO LEAVES AND WHO GETS TO STAY. BUT I CAN ONLY HAVE ONE BFF. CHOOSING A NEW BEST FRIEND IS A BIG DECISION AND THIS WON'T BE EASY. "I KNEW THAT SHE WAS LYING WHENEVER SHE SAID EVERYTHING WAS FINE." I'M SORRY, I CAN'T DECIDE RIGHT NOW. BUT IN THE END, ONLY ONE WILL JOIN ME IN MY LIFE AS MY NEW BEST FRIEND FOREVER.

 TALK TO YOU NEVER, T.T.Y.N. * ALL OF MY LIFE * DON'T YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN WAITING? * * For the best friend. * COULD YOU BE THE ONE I WANT? * * My best friend. HERE WE ARE TODAY TO CELEBRATE A VERY FAMOUS "MY BFF" WITH PARIS HILTON. CAN YOU BE THE ONE? WELL, WE'RE GONNA FIND OUT. SO WE'RE AT THE HOTEL INTERCONTINENTAL HEADING DOWN TO THE BALLROOM TO MAKE A PRESS CONFERENCE. WHAT I HAVE TO SAY WHEN I GET THERE IS SALAAM OR SHALOM? SALAAM. I'M GONNA MESS THIS WHOLE UP. NOT "ALAY-KUM"? "ALAH-KUM"? - THAT'S "HALA"... - AS-SALAMU ALAYKUM. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO EXPECT. I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS. I KNOW THAT I'M GONNA BE SOMEONE LIKE THEY'VE NEVER MET BEFORE. I'M ABOUT TO GO OUT. AS-SALAAM ALAYKUM, DUBAI. SHUKRAN, DUBAI. I GOT IT. HUGE. WE ARE A VERY HOSPITABLE NATION. I HOPE YOU HAVE A FANTASTIC TIME. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY, LET THE SHOW BEGIN. - I'M NERVOUS. - MISS PARIS HILTON! AS-SALAMU ALAYKUM, DUBAI. I AM SO HONORED TO BE HERE. THIS IS MY FIRST TIME HERE IN DUBAI. AND IT IS BEAUTIFUL. I'M SO EXCITED AND EXCITED TO MEET MY NEW BEST FRIEND OUT HERE. THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH FOR COMING. AND SHUKRAN, DUBAI. I LOVE YOU. NOW THAT THE PRESS CONFERENCE IS OVER, I'M OFF TO MEET MY POTENTIAL BFFs. I HOPE THEY'RE AS EXCITED TO MEET ME AS I AM TO MEET THEM. I THINK YOU SHOULD CHOOSE ME TO BE YOUR BFF BECAUSE I KNOW DUBAI VERY WELL AND I KNOW THAT IF YOU COME WITH ME AND WE GO OUT TOGETHER, YOU'LL HAVE A LOT OF FUN. THE FIRST TIME I SAW PARIS HILTON ON TV, I WAS LIKE, "WHOA, SHE'S A PARTY GIRL." AND THEN WHEN I HEARD SHE WAS COMING TO DUBAI, I WAS LIKE, "WHY SHOULDN'T I BE HER BFF?" I THINK I'M JUST LIKE HER. WE CAN PARTY TOGETHER AND I THINK IT'S TIME TO DO IT PARIS HILTON STYLE. PARIS, THE REASON WHY I THINK YOU SHOULD PICK ME IS BECAUSE YOU'RE CLASSY, YOU'RE A BUSINESSWOMAN AND YOU KNOW HOW TO HAVE FUN AND BALANCE IT ALL OUT. I THINK WE'D TOTALLY BE COMPATIBLE AND WE'D JUST CONNECT AND VIBE. I KNOW YOU JUST WANT A TRUSTWORTHY FRIEND THAT YOU CAN HAVE FUN WITH, SO JUST PICK ME SO WE CAN HAVE SOME FUN. WHAT I'M GOING TO SAY TO PARIS IS I REALLY WANT HER TO PICK ME BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW, OR AS YOU SEE, I'M NOT LIKE THE OTHER GIRLS HERE. MAYBE THEY JUST WANT TO BE FAMOUS FOR A BIT OR MAYBE THEY JUST WANT TO SAY THAT THEY WENT OUT WITH YOU, BUT ME, MY DREAM IS TO BE FAMOUS. I'M EXCITED... VERY EXCITED TO MEET HER. I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE PARIS HILTON. IT'S JUST GONNA BE AMAZING SEEING HER IN THE FLESH. PARIS HILTON IS REALLY HOT. SHE KNOWS HOW TO DRESS AND SHE LOVES ATTENTION. I CAN SEE THAT. AND I LOVE ATTENTION. I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING YET. SHE'S PROBABLY SEEN BELLY DANCERS BEFORE, PROBABLY SOME THAT ARE BETTER THAN ME, BUT I HOPE SHE ENJOYS IT. PARIS HAS TO LIKE ME. I'M CRAZY, WILD, FUNKY... JUST LIKE HER... AND I'M TALENTED. SO DEFINITELY, I'M GONNA TRY TO DO A LITTLE SOMETHING SOMETHING THAT I WROTE JUST FOR HER. I DON'T THINK SHE'S WEARING JEANS OR... MEETING PARIS HILTON FOR FIRST TIME IT'S SO EXCITING FOR ME. I'M SO NERVOUS. OH, HERE SHE IS! I DON'T REALLY KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I'M GOING TO SAY TO HER. OH MY GOD. OH GOD. I'M SO EXCITED. IT'S MY DREAM COME TRUE. - HI, PARIS. - AS-SALAMU ALAYKUM. ALAYKUM SALAMU. THIS IS MY FIRST TIME TO DUBAI, SO I'M HAPPY TO HAVE MY FRIEND NAYLA TO HELP ME OUT.

I AM 25 YEARS OLD. I'M A MAKEUP ARTIST AND A MODEL. WHAT I ADMIRE THE MOST ABOUT PARIS IS THE FACT THAT SHE'S SOMEBODY DEFINITELY TO LOOK AT FOR INSPIRATION AND MOTIVATION.

THE BELLY DANCE. THIS IS A FIGURE EIGHT. - NICE. - - IT'S CUTE. - IN MY HEAD IT LOOKED REALLY CUTE TO DO A DANCE FOR HER, BUT THEN THE LADY BESIDE HER STARTED LAUGHING AT ME, WHICH IS NOT VERY NICE TO LAUGH AT PEOPLE WHEN THEY'RE UNDER PRESSURE.

OF COURSE I DON'T KNOW YOU. I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT YOU, SO I'M NOT GONNA SAY, "I LOVE YOU, PARIS! I'M CRAZY ABOUT YOU!" THIS IS GONNA BE THE BEST THING TO HAPPEN TO ME...

MARTA, CHRISTY, DALILA, PLEASE STEP FORWARD. SO I HAVE TO SEND SOME GIRLS HOME AND IT'S NOT GOOD NEWS. I'VE BEEN CALLED TO SOME VERY IMPORTANT BUSINESS MEETINGS, SO I'VE LEFT NAYLA IN CHARGE AND SHE'S IDENTIFIED SOME GIRLS WHO DON'T HAVE MY BEST INTERESTS IN MIND. HI, GIRLS. - Girls: HI. TONIGHT, SOME OF YOU WILL BE GOING HOME. BUT TONIGHT SOME OF YOU WILL BE MOVING INTO THE BFF DUBAI PENTHOUSE. WHOO! AS YOU KNOW, FIRST IMPRESSIONS ARE VERY VERY IMPORTANT, AND THEY'RE TOUGH. I'M SURE YOU GOT NERVOUS, YOU HAD TO IMPRESS PARIS AND IT WAS A VERY DAUNTING EXPERIENCE. COULD THE FOLLOWING GIRLS PLEASE STEP FORWARD? KELLY. TARIN. CELINA. NATALIA. LILIYA. PARIS WANTS TO TELL YOU... "T.T.Y.N." OF COURSE I STILL LOVE PARIS. SHE'S AWESOME. SHE'S A GREAT ROLE MODEL. BUT SHE DIDN'T PICK ME AND THAT'S FINE. I'M NOT... I'M UPSET THAT I WASTED MY TIME, BECAUSE I DON'T EVEN LIKE PARIS HILTON. NAYLA DEFINITELY MADE THE RIGHT DECISION WITH HER. T.T.Y.N. OKAY, LADIES, YOU'RE SAFE... FOR NOW. - AS-SALAMU ALAYKUM. - ALAYKUM AS-SALAMU. - HOW ARE YOU, PARIS? - GOOD. I WANNA TAKE ONE LAST LOOK AT THE GIRLS BEFORE I PICK MY FINAL 12. IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ME TO KNOW WHO CAN HANDLE THEMSELVES ON THE RED CARPET ALONGSIDE ME. AND NOTHING SAYS CONFIDENCE LIKE WALKING DOWN A CATWALK. WE LOVE YOU, PARIS. - OH. - IT'S GLITTER, BY THE WAY. - HI. - I'M A STAR STATUS DIVA. THAT'S WHY YOU SHOULD PICK ME. - WOW. - WHAT YOU GOT? - - HUGE. SO WHY DO YOU THINK PARIS SHOULD PICK YOU OVER HER? WELL, I'M NOT GONNA SIT HERE AND LIE. I REALLY DON'T KNOW HER AND I REALLY DON'T KNOW YOU. SO I'D REALLY HAVE TO GET TO KNOW YOU BOTH TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION. BUT, WITH CONFIDENCE, I KNOW I'M HERE WITH GOOD INTENTIONS. AND IF YOU ARE HERE TO MEET A GOOD FRIEND IN DUBAI, I CAN TELL YOU I'M REALLY DOWN TO EARTH, OUTGOING, AND THAT'S THE TRUTH. AND WHY DO YOU THINK PARIS SHOULD CHOOSE YOU OVER HER? I JUST THINK I'M A COMPLETE PACKAGE OF WHAT PARIS WANTS FROM A BFF. I CAN OFFER HER EVERYTHING I HAVE AND A WHOLE LOT MORE. I'M LOYAL AND I'LL BE THERE FOR HER ALL THE TIME AND PLUS, AS IN DUBAI, I DO SPEAK THE LANGUAGE. SO IF WE'RE STUCK SOMEWHERE, NO ONE SPEAKS ENGLISH, - I'LL HELP YOU OUT. - HI, PARIS. I THINK I'M GONNA BE HOT BLONDE #2. I THINK SHE'S SMART ENOUGH TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S THE BEST, AND IF IT'S ME OR NOT, I KNOW SHE'S GONNA CHOOSE THE RIGHT PERSON. WE HAVE THIS QUOTE IN ARABIC, WHICH I BELIEVE IN: "A TRUE FRIEND YOU WILL FIND NEXT TO YOU WHEN YOU REALLY NEED THEM IN YOUR BAD TIMES." WELL, I HOPE YOU WILL NEVER HAVE BAD TIMES, SO I'LL BE NEXT TO YOU WHENEVER YOU WANT. - THANK YOU. - YOU'RE WELCOME. HEY, GORGEOUS. SHAKO MAKO. - "SHAKO MAKO" MEANS "WHAT'S UP?" YEAH. - WHAT'S UP? - YEAH, LOVES IT. - HEY, WHAT'S THE MATTER? MERO, PIZZA, MARCHE AND MANDOLINO... 100% MADE IN ITALY. I WAS IMITATING THE TYPICAL ITALIAN GUY, YOU KNOW? I DON'T KNOW WHY, BUT I'M REALLY STARTING TO LIKE MARTA, THE ITALIAN GIRL. YOU KNOW, THEY CALL ME BODYLICIOUS. - I'M SIMPLY SWEET AND SEXY... - YEAH. ...SO ROCKING HOT AND HAPPY. YES, OF COURSE. I WANT TO BE HER BFF, SO WHATEVER IT TAKES, IT'S GONNA GET ME THERE, WHY NOT? AND I THINK, YEAH, I AM ONE STEP CLOSER. WHY DO YOU THINK PARIS SHOULD PICK YOU OVER HER? I'M LOYAL, HONEST AND I'LL NEVER TRADE HER. - NEVER WHAT? - TRADE YOU. - TRADE YOU. - TRADE ME? YEAH, YOU'RE MY IDOL. I'LL NEVER TRADE YOU. I FEEL, YES, I'M ONE STEP CLOSER TO BEING HER BFF. YAY! HAVING THE GIRLS BACK FOR THE WALK-OFF REALLY HELPED. I'VE MADE UP MY MIND AND I'M READY TO DROP SOME T.T.Y.N.... TALK TO YOU NEVER. SO TIME TO CHOOSE MY FINAL 12. YES. OKAY. CHRISTY. OH MY GOSH, SHE'S SO PRETTY. DANA ELEMARA. - I THINK SHE WAS... SHE WAS COOL, HUH? - SHE WAS NICE. SHE WAS NICE. LOOK AT THAT SMILE. - SHE LOOKS SWEET. - YEAH. AND SHE DOESN'T DRINK. THAT'S NICE. - YEAH, SHE'S ALWAYS SOBER. - SHE'S NOT SOME WEIRDO. NO, I DON'T WANT... AND THAT A BIG NO IN DUBAI. IF YOU WANT A REAL, TRUE DUBAI BEST FRIEND, STAY AWAY FROM THE ONES WHO DRINK, 'CAUSE WHEN THEY DO IT HERE, THEY GO CRAZY. SO YOU DON'T WANT THAT. YOU WANT A GOOD, DECENT... YEAH, I THINK THAT'S BETTER. I DON'T WANT SOME CRAZY PERSON - THAT'S GONNA GET ARRESTED AROUND ME... - NO. EXACTLY. ...AND GIVE ME A BAD REPUTATION. 'CAUSE IF I HANG OUT WITH SOMEONE WHO'S, YOU KNOW, WEIRD, THAT'S GONNA AFFECT ME AND LOOK BAD ON ME. OF COURSE, YEAH. YOUR BEST FRIEND SHOULD BE YOUR ANCHOR. - MM-HMM. - SHE SHOULD REFLECT WHO YOU ARE. SO I SAID PEOPLE CAN FEEL REALLY COMFORTABLE AROUND ME. - YEAH. - HOW CAN I SAY ANYTHING BAD ABOUT HER? - SHE'S SWEET. - SHE'S WHAT WE CALL IN OUR CULTURE... - SHE IS, LIKE, GUTSY. - MM-HMM. SHE WAS AN ITALIAN GANGSTER AND I WAS A SUPERMODEL. - AMY PARKER. - SHE'S THE ONE WHO DID THE BELLY DANCE. YEAH, I KNOW. I HAVE MY RESERVATIONS ABOUT HER, 'CAUSE IF YOU WANT A GENUINE BEST FRIEND, AND SHE SEEMS TO BE GENUINE AT BEING... I DON'T KNOW. IF YOU'RE UPSET, WOULD SHE BE CONSOLING YOU WITH HER BELLY DANCING? - YEAH. - I DON'T KNOW. THAT'S GONNA BE HARD. - THAT WAS REALLY RANDOM. - THAT'S VERY STRANGE. I'M NOT A DUDE. I DON'T REALLY WANNA SEE A GIRL BELLY DANCE, BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS CUTE. AT LEAST SHE TRIED TO DO SOMETHING. MY SECOND IMPRESSION FOR PARIS WAS WAY BETTER THAN MY FIRST IMPRESSION. - BASSANT. - YEAH. SHE'S A TV PRESENTER. I LIKE THAT SHE WAS AT LEAST HONEST THAT SHE HAS MOTIVES, WHAT SHE WANTS TO DO. I LIKE IT BETTER THAN WHEN PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO HIDE IT. - UPFRONT. - YEAH, SHE'S UPFRONT ABOUT IT, WHICH I LIKE. OKAY, I WALK WITH DIVA. WE DON'T KNOW THAT, THAT SHE DOESN'T... SHE'S NOT INTO SHOWBIZ, THEN SHE HAS TO REALLY TO PROVE HERSELF. VERY DIFFERENT MEETING PARIS THE SECOND TIME FROM THE FIRST TIME. - IT WAS MUCH MORE RELAXED. - YEAH, SHE'S CUTE. NO. YES. - - YES. MMM, MAYBE. KEEP HER IN THE MIDDLE. - NO. - YEAH. - NO. - YES. I WANNA GO TO THE PENTHOUSE TONIGHT. I WANNA BE THE FIRST. AND I CAN MAKE IT. I PROVE IT FOR HER. FINALLY I MET HER, I SAW HER AND I TOUCHED HER. I'M SORRY BECAUSE I'M CRYING, BUT IT'S JUST FEELING. MMM, NO. OKAY. ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT NINE 10 11. ALL RIGHT, GOT IT. HUGE. THE SECOND TIME MEETING PARIS HILTON WAS A PRETTY GOOD WALK-IN. I FEEL SO COMFY. IT WAS NOT BAD. I WAS JUST LIKE, "HEY, WHAT'S UP?" HI, GIRLS. - Girls: HELLO. WELL, AFTER TAKING EVERYTHING INTO ACCOUNT, PARIS MADE HER DECISION. SO I HAVE TO SEND SOME GIRLS HOME AND IT'S NOT GOOD NEWS. SO, GIRLS, THIS IS ELIMINATION TIME. THREE OF YOU ARE STAYING AND THREE OF YOU ARE GOING HOME. MARTA, CHRISTY, DALILA, PLEASE STEP FORWARD. THE THREE OF YOU AT THE FRONT... YOU'RE IN MY FINAL 12. - - OH MY GOD. I WANNA HUG THEM TOO. HUG ME TOO. - I JUST WANTED TO MEET YOU. - WE'LL HANG OUT IN BONDI. - OKAY. - BYE, GORGEOUS. THANK YOU. WHY? 'CAUSE I REALLY WANTED TO BE HER BEST FRIEND AND I THINK SHE'S MADE A HUGE MISTAKE, BUT WHAT CAN YOU DO? I COULDN'T... I DON'T KNOW. I FEEL SO BAD. WELL, I CAN'T SAY THAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE ELIMINATED, BECAUSE ALL THE GIRLS ARE REALLY LOVELY AND SWEET. I REALLY LIKE ALL OF THEM. I THINK JUST SOME OF THEM HAD A CHANCE TO GET ALONG, GET INTO PENTHOUSE, TRY TO MEET PARIS AND GET ALONG WITH HER WHILE SOME OTHERS JUST DIDN'T. IT'S LUCK. YOU'RE GORGEOUS, NAGRIS. SHE'S TOO GIRLIE.
