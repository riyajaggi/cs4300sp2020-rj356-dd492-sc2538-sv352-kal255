 I didn't think... I didn't want... Mom. I used to do this when you first came homefrom the hospital... listen to you breathe. Time's up, Cave. Let's go. So what kind of cancer?

 That's right. I can eliminate a week on the Vineyardwith your snotty-ass mother. Wait, now, I didn't say anything like that. Well, that was my interpretation. I thought we were horse-trading. You're going to extort me so that youdon't have to spend time with my mother? - Mm-hmm.- The grand duchess has never liked me, and you know it. And now that I've dragged her baby boyall the way across the country, she'll be waiting to skin me alive. - That's not true.-Yes, it is and you know it. Here we go. Can I speak to you for a moment? Can I help you? Ms. Parnell, I'm Owen Cave. You've spoken to my ex-wifeand my son, Warren. Menlo Park. Long way from home. Are you here as an officer or as a father? I'm here to give your wife the opportunityto do the right thing. That's the point of my work. Ms. Parnell, you're digging intoa painful period for a lot of people. Some of us still haven't healed. I heard your podcast. I just don't understand why you wannaopen all that up again in such a... public fashion. Because I think there's a good chanceyour son is innocent. You know, for years after the trial... I actually dreamedthat I found another clue, some new piece of evidencethat would point me away from Warren. And I would've loved to have discovered that I made the biggest mistakeof my career in that investigation. But that was a fantasy that I had to stopallowing myself to indulge in. I had to move on. All of us did. Now, I'm asking you, as a father, not as a uniform, to stop. Please. I can't do that. What if I'm right? What if you did make a mistake? My son deserves to be in prison. And you're gonna come to the sameconclusion because it's the truth. Now that just turned usfrom the new people in the neighborhood to the black people in the neighborhood. Now, Owen doesn't like me digging. Now. One at a time. Owen, Lanie... She called me back, by the way. She left a very clear message. "Fuck you." And if we keep bothering her, she'll file a restraining order. I'm gonna ask Markus to look into... Markus? As in "used to make your knees go weak", "drive by his housein the middle of the night" Markus? - That's interesting.-That was 20 years ago. When we first met, we bonded overbeing the new girls in the boys' club. Do you remember the other thingthat brought us together? Mm-hmm. Louisiana roots. That crappy, no-hot-water apartment. Bulletproof Chinese foodfrom that janky restaurant on the corner. Broken hearts. We met post-Markus. I was there for the oil spillthat was you. Tread lightly. - Okay.-Okay. Ooh. Lanie's aunt. Susan Carver. She was at the trial every day, and in these photos, she looks particularly close to the twins. Her social mediais filled with pics of them as kids. Schoolteacher, no kids of her own. You know who never gave a statement? Josie? Really? Her mom said she was too fragile, andthe cops said they had enough information. Oh. Yes? Are the rumors trueabout why you left the OPD? Are the rumors true why you ran awayfrom the West Coast all those years ago? Tou-motherfucking-ché. What you need, Pop? My new series... Yeah, about Warren Cave. I listened. Are you familiar with his father, Owen? Chief of Police, Menlo Park. Oh. So you did listen. He gave me the full-court press today, trying to get me to back off. I wanna know why he doesn'twant me digging into his son's case. Well, you stay putting your foot in it. Are you in or not? So this mean we back together again? - Working together.- Yeah, right. That's what they all say. Then all of a sudden, it's "Markus. Markus, please. Markus, please." I need some more of your time." Why are you terrible? Anything else? One more thing. No, two. Hit me. Chuck's sister-in-law, Susan Carver. I've been trying to reach herand one of the daughters, Lanie Buhrman. Both are in South Bay, both are stonewalling me, and I need one or the otherto help me find the missing twin. Look, I need to talk to anybody thatmight have information to clear Warren. - What do you think?-I will help you out. You know, it might be nice for meto flex that muscle again. But I gotta warn you, baby, I ain't cheap. What are you doing here? You don't look so good. All right, put that out. What do you want, Lanie? A reporter came to see me last week. Did you point her in my direction? She thinks that your son is innocent. So do I. The state didn't. Well, the state's gottena lot of things wrong, haven't they? Like your mental health. You think all the secrets came outduring the trial? Hmm? Thought so. Are you here to threaten me? It's not gonna work. It's cute that you believe that. Good for you. When you're a kidand your parent dies, it feels like everythingthat was once solid shatters. The ground becomes quicksand. You experiencethe constant sensation of falling. I know that feeling well. I was nine when I lost my mother. But what I don't know is how it feels when your parent diesin a horrifically violent manner. Chuck! Chuck! Oh, my God! The young womenat the center of this story do know. Oh, my God! According to police testimonyand the prosecution, Chuck's daughters awaken the morningafter Halloween to their mother's screams. - Josie. Josie, get up. Josie, get up.-What? Oh, no! Daddy! Uh, he's dead, he's dead. Oh, no! Oh, my God. He's dead! Mom? My husband! - A knife. I... I don't know.- No! - Come on, go upstairs. No, no, no.-Please, don't... No! Despite the old detective adagethat the first place to look when someone gets killed in the homeis the family... Erin Buhrman and her daughterswere quickly ruled out as suspects. Why? Lanie testified on the record. Josie did not. And she never attended the trial. Not once. Not even the daythe guilty verdict was read. In fact, the last time anyone saw Josie Buhrman was at her high school graduation. Why is Josie hiding? Try Lanie again, then Susan, then Lanie. We'll tag-team till one of them talks. We've gotta find Josie. I don't understand why youputting them on blast like that. Do you even know what I do, what I've done for the past 20 years? You get in people's business. Stop. I'm serious. If that twin is hiding, it's because she doesn't wanna be found. How you gonna force somebody to talkabout the worst shit in their lives? Twelve dollars for some cherries? What the fuck? Look, the girl is hiding for a reason. That's all we're saying. Then I want her to tell me about it. Why? What if someone came to you and asked youhow you felt when your mother died? See, that's what I'm talking about. See, I was with youuntil you brought up Mama. You doing an awful lot for this white boy. I think he's innocent. So what? He's AB, Poppy. If Daddy finds out about that... Daddy find out about what? - Nothing.-Nothing. I don't know, Lanie. Maybe we talk to her. Yeah, we can't do that. I watch these news programsand I see the documentaries and the books, and they make pain romantic. And it's not. It's just pain, and we should say that. If we talk, it's red meat, okay? Then it never stops. And what about Josie? Huh? Could she find her? If she looked hard enough, could she find her? Josie's safe. I really need to talk to her, okay? You know you can't do that. Just leave heralone. She's fine where she is. Where is that? Huh? Where? - We're not having this conversation again.-God! Don't touch me. Calm down. --Wait. Is that her? Oh, shit. - Hey, you guys okay?-Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Call 911. Call 911! You guys okay? Can you get out? Hang on. You're not complaining about the pricenow that it's in your belly. Didn't say it wasn't good. What's going on with Daddy? Daddy's, you know, Daddy. No, he's not. For a minute at the party, he didn't know me. He was drunk, Pop. - No, he wasn't. What he said to me... You pissed him off. - You piss everybody off.-Just like you doing with the Buhrmans. I'm just concerned about Daddy's health. Why are you so defensive? 'Cause you push on peopleuntil they just wanna... You know? Okay, I'm not tryingto step on anybody's toes. I know y'all been holding it down here. Daddy just seemed off to me. When was the last time he saw a doctor? I got some businessl need to take care of. Need to get across the bridgebefore it gets backed up. Black people love doing shit like this. Avoid, avoid, avoid. - Look, you can't ignore this.-Watch me. We came over here to havea nice day with our sister, that's all. A nice day with you. The next time you wanna lecture us, drive to Oakland. Gas costs money. Come if you coming. You're ignoring me too? Poppy. You haven't been back full-timefor six months. We've been doing life here in Caliwhile you were back east just fine. Works for everybody but you. I'm just saying look out for Daddy. - Okay.-Okay, what? Okay. You said it. Now let it go. You know it don't take nothingfor that one to get up in the cut, stop answering her phone. Look, we all wanna be happythat you're back. Okay? Yeah. - Love you.-Love you too. - Hey.-There's been an accident, Pop. Lanie's in the hospital and... Susan's dead. She dropped her phone. I told her to pull over. She wouldn't do it. It fell... I don't know, but... Can we do this later? I think we've goteverything we need here. Hey. You took Susan's phone? Is that the kind of stuffthat got you kicked off the force? - Do you want the damn thing, or don't you?-I don't know. Isn't this a, uh, "by any means necessary" situation? Right? 'Cause that's what you're sellingon your podcast. It's like your life depends on itas much as his. Come on, girl, I... You gotta help me out here. All right, let me ask you a question. Cave is housed in San Quentin, right? - Yeah.-So he's AB. Does your father know about that? No. So you're out here on a limb, and now I'm out here with you. Look, we've been down this road before. Don't leave me hanging. They were fighting in the car. I could see it from where I was. I told the cops everything I knew. I even stayed around a little whilejust to... get my head together. That's when I saw the phone in the weeds. There's no pass code. There should be enough thereto help you tell your story. Markus... He better be innocent. All right, Pop? 'Cause... you already know. Let's just see if there's anythingthat could help us find Josie, and then we'll get it back to the family. - Is he still in love with you?-No. Well, he did this. What? Lanie went through a blonde phase. This woman is very put together. Wait a minute. That's Josie. And that's New York. Look, it's one of those private parks. We don't have those in California. Look at those West Indian nanniessitting on that bench. That is also not a Bay Area thing. Make a list of all the New York numbersin the phone and start calling. Josie is the key. I need to talk to her. She's getting married. Text chain. New York area code. She's listed as Vivienne Parr. Bingo. My first wife diedwhen Mason was five months old. Vivienne is the only motherhe's ever known. He was two when we met. What's your central parenting philosophy? Attachment parenting. Mason's already lost one maternal figure, so I think that it's imperativehe feels as close to me as possible. Which means he sleeps with us a lot. He does. But even at four, he's emotionally intelligent. He knows what he needsto feel safe and secure. I love that about him. He's a very thoughtful boy. - Are you a British citizen?-Mmm. I'm from Esher. Just outside London. Any plans to go back and forth? No. No. Our lives are here. Both my parents are gone. - I'm an only child, so... Sorry. - Please leave a message.- Hi, Josie... Uh, Vivienne. This is Poppy Parnell. I would love to give you the opportunityto discuss your father's story. I'm sending you a link for an upcomingepisode of my podcast I think you'll want to hear. I need your help filling in the blanks. How could the entire Buhrman family, a mother and two daughters, sleep through such a violent encounter? All attempts to locate Josie Buhrmanhave led to dead ends. Is she alive? Is she in hiding? We'd like to know. So, Josie, if you're out there, if you're listening, you might be the keyto Warren Cave's innocence. - I'm sor-sorry.-It's okay. - Did you search her bedroom?-No. Was it locked? No. Your aunt was a private person. - This feels disrespectful.-Fine. I'll do it. - Lanie... Her phone wasn't with her stuff, okay? The cops said maybe it was lostin the wreckage. The wreckage is not in Susan's bedroom. I understand that. But maybe there'ssomething about Josie in there. - If you don't wanna help me... I wanna help ya. Then do it! I'm not a vase. I'm not gonna shatter. Hey. hey, hey, just... You still in pain? No. She needs to know about Susan. Even if she doesn't wanna see me. I think you shouldleave your sister alone. She doesn't wanna be found. You should respect that. How could you say that to me? Because it's the truth. Because I love youand I don't wanna see you get hurt. You really can't tell you two apart. Yeah, nobody could. Is this one you? Yeah. You're sitting next to the same kidin every one of these pics. Kindergarten, first grade, second, third. What? That's Warren Cave. We used to be friends. What did you think when youwatched your father testify against you? I wondered if I was really his son. Were you close growing up? He wasn't around much, but... I asked for a police scanner when I was 11so I could go on patrol... with him. I actually thought it was coolthat my dad was a cop. Why do you think any man, a lawman no less, would testify against his own son ifhe wasn't absolutely sure he was guilty? I've been asking myselfthat same question for 20 years. And? He must know something I don't. Good boy. I've tried to see you. You denied my request. - This time, I thought I... Twice. You tried to see me twicesince you put me in here. I need to talk to you. Stop talking to that woman. She's using you. She's gonna turn you into a circus clown, then make a fool outta you. So you're here to protect me? After 19 years? Bullshit. Don't drag us through this again. You've ruined enough lives already. You have a little brother now. - Who I've never met.-What about your mother? You don't give a shit about her. He hasn't changed. He'll never change. It's all right. How do you thinkyou got into this dog program? Because of your outstanding character? That was me. I may not have been here, but I haven't forgotten you. I've done what I could to... What are you hiding? You leave it. Or I can make your life miserable in here. Not if I killed you. You know, they powered downthe gas chamber in here. Permanently. So a life sentence is just daysstacked on days. I could spend them thinking abouthow you drained the life from me... and then how I drained it from you. Officer. If I am the thingthat you think that I am, then I have every right to kill you, you piece-of-shit motherfucker. Because you know I'm innocent. Hey. Hey. Where you headed? New York. I got an address for Josie Buhrman. She goes by the name of Vivienne Parr, andonce I got that, it all started to click. - She used to live in England... How long you gone? Until I can get her to talk. You forgetting something? - Oh, shit. The dinner party.-Yeah. "Shit. The dinner party." Tomorrow night. I've got 15 people coming, Poppy. Including all the name partners. Babe, we just... We-We just have to reschedule. No, I cannot reschedule. I'm just getting my footing at this firm, and you saidthat you would be here for it. Babe, it's gonna be okay. Okay. You just... They have things come up all the time. - You cannot... You have things come up all the time. You cannot put our lives on holdto go chase a ghost. I... will text you when I land. Text you when I land. Don't be mad. Love you. Good investigatorstake advantage of the fact that people are creatures of habit. That natural desire for routine, comfort, safety, for community. --Where we eat... where we worship... where we take our children to play.

Well, she did all the work. Sorry, I'd really prefer cash. It's just easiertill everything's sorted out with my visa. Bit at the mercyof the State Department till then. Good job. Oh, shit. Josie. Josie. See, it's a dating websitefor incarcerated men. My sister put my picture up. I already got ten letters. - Ten letters.-Can she get all of us on that? Mm-hmm. Who's that black woman came to see you? Just... a reporter asking about my case. And that's it? That's it. Susan died en route to the hospital. I'm truly sorry. Thank you for telling me. I'm not here to cause problems for you. And I hate to bring yousuch terrible news. But I'm trying to getan innocent man out of prison. - He's not innocent.-I think he is. And I think your sister lied aboutseeing him jump the fence that night. Well, is there anything you can rememberfrom that night? This isn't a story to me, okay? This is my life. Was my life... I... I have a family now, and youare parachuting in to destroy that. It's your aunt's. I found it near the accident siteand kept it for you. Maybe we were all wrong. I have to get to the truthof what happened that night. I have to know if he's innocent. I have to go. There he is. Hey, Markus. Armand. - Haven't seen you in a while.-I know. Everything okay? Oh, yeah. Right as rain, brother. Right as rain. Five years without a drink and counting. How you doin'? Can't complain. - I do anyway though.- Hey, let me ask you something. How's that boss of yours over there? Chief Cave. He a hard-ass? Nah, he's one of us. Cop's cop. You thinking aboutgetting back behind the badge? Fuck no. A friend of mine, he put in an applicationfor the department. That's why I'm asking. Hey, Cave's old partner, he still around? - He died two years ago.-Oh. A week after he retired. - No shit.-Good man. His wife still brings cupcakesto the station every Fourth of July. Any idea where I can find her? ...up and breathe. I hope you don't mind. It helps with my plantar fasciitis. Do your thing. No, I'm good, thank you. My husbandnever brought the job home with him. So he never told you any storiesabout him and Owen Cave? Oh, George said he was a climber. - Too ambitious.- Gunning for chief from day one. Did he think Owen Cave was dirty? Oh, no. No. Not at all. Nothing like that. He was just so straight and narrowhe couldn't see sideways. Probably why he didn't see that businesswith his wife coming. Who? Melanie? She was banging that dead guysix ways from Sunday. Holy shit. Hey. - You good?-I just came... You have something for me? Oh, yeah. Your girl Melanie Cavewas having an affair. With Chuck Buhrman. You lyin'. Nope. Went on for months. And you know what that means. If Owen Cave found out... He had motive. Do you remember our ninth birthday? Aunt Susan got you the yellow bow. No, you had the yellow one. I had the red one. Please come home. I miss you, Lanie. I love you so much that... it's hard to breathe without you. But I am never coming home. You terrify me.
