 So you got your clearance back. Your lawyer did it for me. Technically, now I'm an investigator. I'm close to something. What? What's going on? Warren. What did you find? Your father was unaccounted for at the time of Chuck Buhrman's murder. No, he was on patrol with his partner. There was a gap. Over an hour.

 And he showed up to his next call with blood on his shoes. - Jesus Christ. - Warren. My father had me shanked. What? Oh, my God. And he will do it again. He obviously doesn't want me talking. - You need to get into protective custody. - You think that will work? Do you have any idea how far his reach is? - You're getting played. - Like hell. He's a convict, Pop. He'd tell you Big Bird shanked him if he thought it'd get him out of there. - You didn't see what I saw. - No. But I heard the shit you been spillin' about Owen Cave. - Excuse me? - Your new episode?

 Shining that hot guilty light on Cave without any real evidence? The man went ghost for 74 minutes and then shows up to his next call tracking blood on the carpet. Not enough. You were right there when we found that shit. I'm not saying it ain't him. But you do not go blowing the man up publicly without knowing 100%. I'm not a prosecutor. I'm a podcaster. Hey, my name is on this thing too. And what are you doing? Aren't you supposed to be keeping her in check? - Since when? - Thank you! But it wouldn't hurt to focus on the Buhrmans. Enough! Okay? That's our guy. Jesus Christ! Why is this such a leap for you? He testified against his own son. He never visited for 19 years, and the moment he does his son gets shanked. The man deserves to burn in hell! You got no proof, Pop. Just like you got no proof that Owen killed Chuck. Then get me some, damn it. That's why you're here. Get me some. You know what? I'm done with this shit. What? Markus! Markus. What's going on with you? I was gonna ask you the same thing. - Speak your mind. - All right. Your eyes are way off the main goal here. I mean, look at you. You're hell-bent on burying Owen Cave. Clearly he's pushed some buttons in you. - I'm just going after the truth. - Really. Okay, so now you don't want to work with me anymore? You know, I could've never given you any of this. No matter how hard I worked. I never asked you to. And Ingram and I worked for this together. I know, I know. Women's lib and all that. No, no, no, no. You understand we made choices and sacrifices and decisions to live the way we wanted. As you can see, there are no kids running around in here. Yeah, yeah. Listen. If you want me to keep digging, fine. I'll dig. But we're playing with people's lives here, Pop. Are you ready for the consequences? Hey, Mom. I didn't... I didn't know you were coming. Look, you really shouldn't be here. This place is crawling with germs. I don't care. I had to see you. I know... Is your wound healing okay? Yeah. Did they find out who did it? No, Mom. I read this article the other day in the library, and there's this... There's this cancer doctor out at USCF... No. No, Mom. Mom, listen. He's doing this new experimental treatment that I think you should... No, Warren. It won't help. I'm sorry, sweetie, but I know. I just know. Mom. How's your garden? Tell me about it. Knew that would get ya. Heard from your father yet? I got nothing for him if I did. You trying to get me drunk? Oh, yeah. That podcast has been disrupting our life, so I... am going to disrupt it right back. Cheers. You're not slick. What? You got something brewing. I can see it. Can't a man want to spend a minute with his wife? Come here. Come on. Follow me. Follow me. Damn it. - Yeah? - So, how's the digging? Hey, Pop. I'm on it. I'm down at city hall. They're open this early? I got to pick up my daughter from school later. I didn't wanna have to stand around in line all day. Well, I've been digging. Been looking into Owen's non-police life. The things at the margin. You know, try to understand him better. And your shovel hit something. He's listed as the founder of an organization called "Angel's Halo." Sounds angelic. Sounds bullshit. He's the only name on it. And when cops do public service stuff, they promote it heavily. But this one's got nothing. No footprint. A single donor. So what do you think it is? Well, that's what we have to find out. I'll text you the address. "We"? So we tag-teaming it again, huh? Another lucky day for you. See you in 30 minutes. Back into the field with Markus? We're just trying to figure out this Owen Cave stuff. We need to talk about your father. I plan to draw up a restraining order against him. So you ganked me last night? Last night was real, and you know that. So is this. That's my daddy. He put his hands on my wife. This is my family, Ingram. You're not blood. You don't get a say! I heard you crying yourself to sleep. Your own father scared you, Poppy. Is there something you're not telling me? You know as well as I do something needs to be done. I can't do it. You don't have to. I'll handle it. You're gonna have to work around him. You can't go at him directly. Okay. I wish Susan hadn't made me executor. This is all very overwhelming. Well, why don't you let me help you? You know, you could move out of the hotel and stay with us. Save some money. I'll think about it. Hello? Hello? Vivienne? I have to call you back. - What's going on? I haven't heard... - I'll call you back. All right? Promise. Everything okay? Why would you do that? I mean, sorry. You won't tell me anything. I just wanna stay connected, you know. I don't wanna lose you. - My God, this is all our stuff. - I didn't know she kept everything. You used to love this. I like the name "Vivienne." The British accent kinda threw me, but... I really like the picture of your husband and... son? You look real happy. Sorry. I really shouldn't have done that. I have to get out of here. What? What about all this stuff? Just lock it up. I'll meet you in the car. Angel's Halo is Owen Cave's business, not mine. But its official address is here. That was just for the registration. I helped him set it up. That's all. So what are you? His business manager? Christen! I advise Chief Cave, okay? Scan and shred. Look, if Angel's Halo is really legit, you don't have to worry about... Everything that I do is above board here. You want information? Call Mr. Cave yourself. Thank you. Hey, I'll take another run at him later. Or try a softer target. What are you talking about? That receptionist was giving you a lot of heat. Come on now. She was looking at you the exact same way DeeDee Royce used to. DeeDee. That used to bother you. You only thought it bothered me. - Still picking up your daughter? - Not for a while. Good. Then catch DeeDee 2.0 on one of her breaks and see if you can turn that heat into some info on Owen. - I'll see what I can do. - I bet you will. What's up? How are you? Lillian. You here for moonshine? Lookin' for you. - Yeah? - Yeah. We need to do something about Shreve. - Oh, please go on with all of that. - Listen to me. I said no. I'm gonna file a restraining order to keep him away from my wife. Y'all a trip. You and Poppy sure love the police. That ain't how we do things here. - I'm not the bad guy here. - Really? No, I'm not. Now, we can leave the law out of this on one condition. Make Shreve go see a doctor. Yeah. You know it yourself. He needs help. Lillian, he needs help. Anybody who's around him for five minutes can see that. I guess I was just kinda hoping that it would go away on its own. I even hoped it was drugs or alcohol. I just don't want it to be something that takes him away from me. Yeah. I was 18 when I first saw Shreve. Right outside this bar. He was a giant to me. And he still is. Now, how do you talk to a giant like he's a child? You have 40 minutes. Hey, Jax. Come on, boy. Jax? Warren... - Where's Jax? - They didn't tell you? What? After what happened with Quiroga, he was declared unsound. Unsound? He's being put down. What? You're killing him? The program has a zero tolerance policy, and you know that. So take him out of the program! He doesn't have to fucking die! I'm sorry. Is there someone I can talk to? On his behalf? I'll see what I can do. See, you young bucks don't know nothing about this scene. That's the reason why I still love buying these. You haven't heard real music until you've heard it on vinyl. I'm talking about E-40, Fab, Mac Dre. B-Legit. I don't see you as old, Daddy, but you work really hard to sound like it. Oh, yeah? 'Cause I'm old-school. That's where I'm from. I'm from the... Hey, baby, do me a favor. Go sit in the car for me. - Daddy, what's wrong? - Nothing's wrong. - Everything's okay, sweetheart. - Are you sure? I'm sure. I'll be right out. Markus Killebrew, formerly of OPD. I don't know that we ever met in person, but I've been told you've taken quite an interest in me. Not the time, Chief. You tell Poppy Parnell to back off. You messed with her family, so, you know, she's on your head. And you're okay with it? With her trying to ruin a fellow cop? Smearing his reputation? I mean, my situation isn't quite like what happened to you. I mean, I'm not a drunk who accidentally shot the wrong... Hey, hey. I was cleared of that. It was a good shooting. So you chose to be a security guard over a cop? Then it must have been your choice to give up custody of your only daughter too, right? You tell Parnell to back away... or it goes bad for us all. - Still not here? - Can you give him ten more minutes? We've already given him 30. I'm sorry. Mr. Scoville will need to reschedule. I'm doing this MRI for Lillian. Understand? Lillian. Understood. This way, Mr. Scoville. Poppy got you doin' her dirty work, huh? Always was manipulative. - That's not what this is. - That's bullshit. She been waiting 30 years to get back at me for sticking her in foster care. - What? - 'Cept the shit I did back then was for her own good. Shreve. Baby, please just go with the nurse, okay? Come on. Let's just go. Hey. What's all this about foster care? What happened 30 years ago? You're gonna have to ask your wife about that. - Hey. - Hey, Poppy. He's right over there. Seriously? You just had to drag me down here. Good a place as any. Leverage, right? All right. Angel's Halo is a 501-C. - A charity? - Mm-hmm. Created by Owen Cave on November 29, 1999. Shit. That's a month after Chuck Buhrman's murder. And he's been donating a grand a month to this thing. Never missed a payment in 19 years. Is there a beneficiary? See, here's where it gets interesting. It only lists one... A "JJJ." But I came up with shit on who or whatever the hell that even is. Sounds like hush money. You were right. Cave is hiding something. I knew it. Hey, look... I just want to say I'm sorry for saying all that stuff at the house the other day. - It wasn't... - Look. I'm sorry too. You feel like taking a stroll down memory lane? Take a look at that. I thought my daddy was gonna pop a cap in your ass. Shit. I'm still afraid. That's why I only come around here when he ain't around. - Madam Mayor. - Owen. I'm sorry to surprise you like this, but I wanted to save you a spectacle at the office. What's wrong? I'm putting you on a leave of absence while we open an investigation. So, you leaving? Is that what Lanie told you? Well, she yelled it at me. Told me I was the reason that you were leaving again. Okay, I really don't wanna do this here. My sister died, Josie. Give me a little grace here just to say I'm sorry. I mean, how would you feel if Lanie died? Oh, my God. Do you ever give yourself the creeps? Lanie told me that you saw the painting I did of you in Susan's storage space, and since I can't have the two of you in the flesh, I would at least like to have that. Okay. I paid the manager a hundred bucks to throw everything out. So if you want it, you should go sooner rather than later. Thank you. Oh, shit. What do you mean by "dead-end"? It takes time. I know we'll get there. No, you told me that you had him. The blood on his shoes. I know he's guilty, Warren. But you have nothing. Not yet, but we are onto something. We found a charity that he's been donating a thousand bucks a month to for the past 19 years. Okay, so that's all you got. A fucking tax deduction. He started it right after Chuck's murder. He's the only donor and all the money's going to the same person. It's got to be hush money. All right, so who's the money going to? That's the part we don't know yet. All we have are initials: "JJJ." - Shit. - What? Warren? There was this... kid around my block. I knew him my whole life. Big football star. Everyone called him "Tre-J." John James Jackson. John James Jackson. There are wounds from which we never recover. They strike you on the surface, but quickly burrow deep into the soul and metastasize into something darker. Might the wound of a truth have burrowed deep into the soul of Owen Cave? Metastasized into the most unforgivable sin against his own child? We need to talk. I'm taking Henry to my mother's. I'm not sure when we're coming back. "Some people think you're born bad. But I don't think that's true." I know Jax wasn't born that way, and he doesn't deserve to die just because he made a mistake. Being locked up in a cage can make anyone vicious, 'cause the only way to survive is to fight... "to be bad." He... I'm sorry. Look... Jax, he... he trusted me. In 19 years, he was the only one. Jax attacked because he thought he was protecting someone... he loved. Aus, Jax! You know, my own father wouldn't do that for me. Look, maybe that means he can't be in your program. But that doesn't mean he should have to die. Have you looked at our web page lately? There's a guy says he has info on the murder. Chris Harkin. And every one we've gotten thus far has been useless. Yeah, but this one's not claiming he has the answer like the nutjobs do, just info. He wants to meet. Wait, you just warned me about these Internet lynch mobs and now you're talking about meeting with one? All for the cause. - Thank you. - Hey. I thought you might wanna say good-bye before we bring him to the shelter. - Hey, Jax. - You did it, Warren. - You saved his life. - Hey, hey. That's a good boy. It's okay, bud. They'll find you a good home. Let's go. - Are you okay? - I think my career is over. Alana's leaving me. She's taking Henry with her. All the heat from the podcast became too much for her. You know, in 12 years of marriage, she hardly ever mentioned Warren. She always wanted me looking forward. Or she was just protecting herself. You're the only one that truly got me. That was a long time ago. I should've been here for you. You shouldn't have to go through all this alone. - Yeah, I manage okay. - Goddamn woman. Started stirring up this shit all over again. She's trying to help Warren. Nobody else will. Can you forgive me? For destroying everything? Don't say that. Just... I was so focused on work. Trying to make chief. I ignored you. I drove you to Chuck. - Don't talk like that. - Then I put our only son in prison. I mean, who does that, Melanie? I just couldn't keep my fuckin' mouth shut. I was so noble, so righteous! - And all that time... - What? "All that time," what? - He's my son. He's our son. - I know. It's okay. Owen, it's okay. - It's okay. You're okay. - Yeah, yeah. - What are you doing? Stop! - I'm sorry! You want comfort from me now that your shiny life has just suddenly fallen apart? You left us. Owen, you left us. You took everything from me and Warren. I'm the only one that understood you. Are you fucking kidding me? You stole 19 years of my life! Nineteen years! I'm sorry. I don't care about you. Get out of my... Just get out of my house. Get out of my house! Get out! - Hey. - Hi. So have you decided how long you're staying? I was actually thinking about that, and then Mom came to see me. Yeah, I know. I'm so sorry. That woman. Even her best efforts feel like an assault. I don't know, Lanie. There's just too many memories here. You know? It's so toxic. Okay. Thought I'd give it one more try. You will come say good-bye to Ella though, right? I mean, she really likes her aunt. Of course I will. Don't wanna get too used to that. Hey, Siri. Call "Home." Calling "Home." Hey, Vivienne. Mr. Jackson doesn't get many visitors anymore. - You family? - A friend of mine tracked him down. She asked me to say hello. Nice of her, yeah. His family used to come every day. But the past few years... birthdays and Christmases. - Jesus. - It was a hit-and-run. He was walking home from a Halloween party. Driver hits him, panics... leaves him twisted and bleeding in the street. And Angel's Halo pays for all of this? Every dime. Markus, hey, it's Poppy. Holler back, please? Thanks. Ingram? Babe? I thought you were working late. You know we can play that upstairs after we eat, right? Join me. Have a seat. Now, this may not be as high tech as you're used to, but it'll do. For what? You are gonna record a retraction. "Owen Cave was a good father to Warren." But his son had problems. Everyone saw it. Except Owen's wife, Melanie. Owen looked the other way with his son for years. "Until that one night when Warren..." I'm sorry. I can't say... You can't say my son killed Chuck Buhrman? I thought you were all about the truth? - I'm just trying to help you here... - Bullshit! You destroyed my life. You destroyed my family. You will say whatever the fuck I tell you to! Read it! I just... meant... that your story is incomplete. If you wanna clear your name, we have to give the audience more. More? More? Like tell 'em how it feels to destroy your own blood like I did? How it costs you something you will never get back? All of this so that I wouldn't find out the truth about Angel's Halo? That was an accident. That fucking kid ran right in front of my car. John James Jackson? That's what happened during those... 74 minutes. You could've told the police. And see my career go down the toilet because some stupid, idiot kid was wearing a black costume that no one could see? For 20 years everything was fine... until you showed up and fucked it all up! I'm a good man. That's why I got Tre-J taken care of. I got him in the best facility. And why I got Warren into that dog program, even though he didn't know! Whether you like it or not... my son killed Chuck Buhrman, and I was right to put him in jail. 'Cause I'm a good man. Oh, God! You tell the audience I was a good man. - Poppy? - Sir, excuse me. Poppy! Where's my wife? Sir, I'm gonna need you to come back here. - Please! - Poppy! Where's my wife? - Hey! A police officer died here tonight. - Where the fuck is my wife? Ingram. My father once told me that a man will do one of two things when he's backed into a corner... Are you okay? Lie down and die, or come out fighting. That's how you take a man's measure, find out who he really is. You put him in a corner and see what he does. Unless he's got nothing left to lose. Now that... That's the man you don't wanna mess with, because he will come out fighting every time. But his fight will be to the death. His... and yours. Oh, my God, Poppy. You're not gonna wanna hear this. I just spoke to the street sweeper who saw Warren the night of the murder, leaving the Buhrman house with a knife. This is our worst nightmare. Owen was right. Warren did it. He killed Chuck. Poppy, you have to call me back.
