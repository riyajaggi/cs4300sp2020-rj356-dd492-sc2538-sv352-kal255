 (Alton Brown) IN THE BEGINNING, CUISINE IS, WELL, EXPERIMENTAL. (caveman) POO-AAH, BLAH, OOOH. AS FOR SAUCE, THERE IS BUT ONE, AND IT COMES CONVENIENTLY PACKAGED INSIDE WHATEVER UNFORTUNATE BEAST HAPPENS ONTO THE MENU. ANCIENT ROME... PUNGENT SAUCES MASK THE FLAVOR AND AROMA OF FOODS CONSIDERABLY PAST THEIR PRIME. 1533... CATHERINE DE MEDICI

 MOVES FROM FLORENCE TO PARIS, TAKING ALONG THE NEWLY INVENTED FORK AND A BATTALION OF COOKS, WHO SOON TEACH SAUCES TO FRENCH COOKS, WHO EVENTUALLY DOMINATE THE WORLD WITH THEIR LABYRINTHINE SYSTEM OF SAUCES. MEANWHILE, WHILE IN ENGLAND, A CHINESE FISH SAUCE FINDS A NEW HOME. MM! CRACKIN' GOOD SAUCE. WE'LL CALL IT CATSUP. AH-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA! AS FOR THE COLONIES, THE FIRST THANKSGIVING TURNS UGLY. TATONKA. LUMPY. WHO CAN BLAME US FOR BEING A LITTLE SAUCE LEERY?

 AFTER ALL, WHO HASN'T SUFFERED AT THE HANDS OF A BROKEN HOLLANDAISE, OR AN INSIPID MARINARA? JOIN US AS WE PEER INTO THE INNER WORKINGS TO HATE--GRAVY. OF THE SAUCE THAT AMERICAN COOKS LOVE TATONKA. LUMPY. LUMPY. KEEP WORKING ON IT. DON'T WORRY ABOUT RECIPES... THE RIGHT PAN, A STOUT WHISK AND SOME HONEST SCIENCE ARE GONNA SET YOU FREE. SO GRAB HOLD OF YOUR GRAVY BOAT, KIDS. THIS IS GONNA BE SOME GOOD EATS. LUMPY. TATONKA. ♪ ♪ CLOUDS, LAVA LAMPS, GRAVY, FINGERNAIL POLISH, PAINT, LIBRARY PASTE, MAYONNAISE... ALL MEMBERS OF A GROUP THAT SCIENCE TYPES LIKE TO CALL COLLOIDS. NOW A COLLOID IS BASICALLY ANY LIQUID OR GAS THAT HAS ANOTHER SUBSTANCE DISPERSED THROUGHOUT IT IN PARTICLE FORM. NOW BELIEVE IT OR NOT, MOST SUCCESSFULLY THICKENED SAUCES ARE INDEED COLLOIDS. SOME, LIKE SAY, MAYONNAISE, ARE ACTUALLY THICKENED BY TINY LITTLE GLOBULES OF FAT, WHILE OTHERS DEPEND ON NOTHING MORE THAN PULVERIZED VEGETABLE MATTER. BUT IN THE MAJORITY OF SAUCES, THE ROLE OF PARTICLE IS PLAYED PERFECTLY BY STARCH GRANULES. AND IF THERE'S ANY MYSTERY TO SAUCE MAKING-- AND WELL, A LOT OF COOKS WOULD SAY THERE IS-- WELL, THEN STARCH IS THE PRIME SUSPECT. NOW THERE ARE A LOT OF STARCHES TO CHOOSE FROM-- A DOZEN OR SO FLOURS, THERE'S CORNSTARCH, POTATO STARCH, RICE STARCH, INSTANT STARCH... YOU KNOW, WHAT I NEED IS A GOOD FOOD SCIENTIST. YOU WOULDN'T HAPPEN TO BE A FOOD SCIENTIST, WOULD YOU? CERTAINLY AM... WELL, WOULD YOU HELP US TO FIND A NICE SAUCE-FRIENDLY STARCH? YES. WHAT YOU PROBABLY DON'T WANT ARE THE ROOT STARCHES. THEY'RE CRYSTAL CLEAR, HOT OR COLD, THEY FREEZE BEAUTIFULLY, BUT THEY'RE CLEAR. SO YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A CLEAR SAUCE OR GRAVY. WOULD YOU EAT A SEE-THROUGH GRAVY? NO, NO. OKAY, SO THAT RULES OUT POTATO STARCH, ARROW ROOT AND TAPIOCA. NOW AT MOST GROCERY STORES, THAT LEAVES, WHAT? ... FLOUR AND CORNSTARCH, RIGHT? YEP, AND FLOUR... PLAIN OLD WHEAT STARCH IS FINE. THEY MAKE SPECIALTY STARCHES JUST FOR THICKENING SAUCE AND GRAVY, BUT YOU CAN JUST USE THE FLOUR YOU'VE GOT ON YOUR SHELF. PICK THE LOWEST PROTEIN FLOUR YOU'VE GOT THERE AND GO WITH IT. LOW PROTEIN, HOW COME? BECAUSE THE PROTEIN IN FLOUR-- SEE, IT'S GOT STARCH AND PROTEIN-- THE PROTEIN COOKS AND FLOATS TO THE TOP. YOU CAN SKIM IT OFF IF IT'S OBJECTIONABLE. OKAY, SO A SOFT SOUTHERN, OR ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR WOULD BE BEST. THAT WOULD BE IDEAL. WELL, THANKS... DO YOU HAVE A FAVORITE SAUCE? MY MAMA'S GOOD OL' MILK GRAVY WITH FRIED CHICKEN IS OUT OF THIS WORLD. SHE WAS A GOOD MAMA. SO WHY DO STARCHES MAKE GREAT THICKENERS? WELL, WHEN INDIVIDUAL STARCH GRANULES RUB UP NEXT TO HOT LIQUIDS, THEY KIND OF BURST, RELEASING ALL THESE LONG CHAINS OF GLUCOSE, WHICH IS A BASIC SUGAR. NOW IF THERE'S ENOUGH OF THESE, THEY TANGLE UP AND TRAP PASSING LIQUIDS AND THICKEN THE SAUCE. NOW SINCE ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR IS THE KITCHEN STANDARD IN THIS COUNTRY, THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA USE TODAY FOR SAUCES. BUT IF YOU'VE GOT PASTRY OR CAKE FLOUR, USE IT. OKAY, SO THEORETICALLY, AT LEAST, GRAVY'S REALLY NOT MUCH MORE THAN STARCH AND A HOT LIQUID, RIGHT? WELL, LET'S MAKE SOME GRAVY, THEN, BECAUSE WE'VE GOT STARCH, ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR, AND A HOT LIQUID, BOILING WATER. SO GRAVY, RIGHT? MAKIN' GRAVY, GONNA BE SMOOTH AND TASTY. GONNA BE... UH-OH. THAT'S NOT GRAVY, THAT'S LUMP CITY, BIRTHPLACE OF THE GRAVY BLUES. HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED. SEE, WHEN THAT BIG 'OL WAD OF FLOUR HIT THE WATER, THE OUTSIDE BITS GELATINIZED IMMEDIATELY, FORMING AN IMPENETRABLE, BUT INCREDIBLY GOOEY OUTER COAT. SO WHEN YOU CUT INTO IT, YOU SEE THAT NOTHING BUT DRY ON THE INSIDE. THAT'S NASTY. SO WHAT WE NEED IS A METHOD TO GET THE FLOUR OR WHATEVER STARCH WE'RE USING INTO THE LIQUID, BUT STILL KEEPING ALL OF THOSE LITTLE GRAINS SEPARATE FROM EACH OTHER. AND THERE'S A FEW DIFFERENT WAYS OF DOING IT. SOME GRAVY MAKERS FAVOR A SLURRY, A COMBINATION OF FLOUR AND A COLD LIQUID-- WINE, WATER OR STOCK-- THAT'S SHAKEN TOGETHER THEN WHISKED INTO THE BASE LIQUID. THEN THE LIQUID'S BROUGHT JUST UP TO A SIMMER TO THICKEN. OTHERS KNEAD EQUAL PARTS OF SOFTENED BUTTER AND FLOUR TOGETHER INTO A PASTE CALLED A BEURRE MANIé. THIS IS THEN WHISKED INTO THE BASE LIQUID AND STIRRED OVER LOW HEAT UNTIL THICKENED. NOW BOTH THESE METHODS WILL INDEED THICKEN A GRAVY, BUT... THE PROBLEM IS, IT'LL TAKE ABOUT AN HOUR OF CONSTANT SIMMERING TO COOK THE RAW FLOURY TASTE OUT OF THESE SAUCES. DURING THAT TIME, THE LIQUID THAT EVAPORATES HAS TO BE REPLACED. AND EVEN THEN, THESE SAUCES JUST AREN'T STABLE. OOH, BUMMER. IF, HOWEVER, YOU WERE TO TAKE EQUAL PARTS-- BY WEIGHT--OF FAT AND FLOUR, AND COOK THEM TOGETHER BEFORE INTRODUCING THE LIQUID, YOU'D HAVE A ROUX. AND THAT, EXCUSE THE EXPRESSION, WOULD BE A GOOD THING. FIRST, AS ALWAYS, THE RIGHT TOOLS. ♪ IF YOU BUY SMART, THERE'S NO REASON YOU CAN'T LIVE A LONG, HAPPY KITCHEN LIFE WITH A LIMITED CULINARY ARSENAL. THE TRICK IS TO HAVE EXPERT ADVICE. DON'T TOUCH THAT! HELLO, "W." WHAT YOU NEED IS A SAUCIER. A SAUCIER-- I'M ALL EARS. OUR NEWEST MODEL... HEAVY GAUGE STAINLESS STEEL WITH A LAYER OF ALUMINUM SANDWICHED THROUGHOUT. WHISK AND SPOON FOR ANY PROFILE, IMPRESSIVE. OVEN-SAFE HANDLE, PERFECT FOR GRAVIES, EMULSIONS AND REDUCTIONS. WELL, IT'S NICE, BUT I DON'T SEE WHAT'S WRONG WITH MY OLD PAN. RIGHT, NOW DO PAY ATTENTION, A.B. YES, MA'AM. STRAIGHT-SIDED SAUCEPANS ARE FINE FOR A LOT OF THINGS, JUST NOT SAUCE MAKING. THE TIGHT CORNERS AND HIGH SIDES MAKE STIRRING AND WHISKING IFFY, AT BEST, IFFY. WHEREAS THE SLOPED SIDES OF THE SAUCIER ALLOWS FOR EASY WHISK ACCESS. AND THE WIDE PROFILE ENCOURAGES REDUCTION THROUGH EVAPORATION. THE BOWL'S SHAPE ALLOWS SMALLER AMOUNTS OF LIQUID TO POOL, IMITATING A RANGE OF PAN SIZES. IMITATING PAN SIZES... GIVE ME YOUR WHISK. MY WHISK. NOT FOR GRAVIES. THE MORE TINES IN A SAUCE RESULT IN BETTER STARCH LIQUID INTEGRATION AND A SMOOTHER SAUCE. NOW GET TO COOKING, WILL YOU? RIGHT. NOW I HATE TO BE LEGALISTIC, BUT THE 1962 EDITION OF "THE JOY OF COOKING" IS QUITE CLEAR. "... A GRAVY WITHOUT MEAT DRIPPINGS "IS NOTHING MORE THAN A SAUCE." LUCKILY, WE ARE TO BE RESCUED FROM CULINARY HAIR SPLITTING BY THIS MIRACULOUSLY APPEARING PORK ROAST. ALL WE HAVE TO DO TO START TURNING THAT, WELL, ADMITTEDLY UNATTRACTIVE POOL OF GOO THERE INTO A LOVELY GRAVY, IS TAKE THE ROAST OFF TO REST FOR A WHILE. THEN WE'RE GONNA DEFAT THIS PAN, JUST TAKING OFF ALL THE FAT THAT WE CAN... SAVING IT, THOUGH, FOR THE ROUX. THEN WE'RE GONNA PLACE THE PAN OVER HIGH HEAT AND ADD ABOUT A CUP, MAYBE TWO, OF RED WINE. JUST BRING IT TO A BOIL, SCRAPING ALL THOSE LITTLE BROWN BITS UNTIL THEY DISSOLVE. THEN WE'RE GONNA STRAIN THAT OFF INTO A MEDIUM SAUCEPAN, AND ADD ABOUT TWO, TWO AND A HALF, CUPS OF CANNED STOCK OR BROTH, THE LOW SODIUM VARIETY. ... TWO BAY LEAVES, FIVE OR SIX PEPPERCORNS. AND WE'RE JUST GONNA LET THAT REDUCE OVER MEDIUM HEAT FOR ABOUT FIVE TO SEVEN MINUTES, UNTIL IT'S DOWN TO ONLY TWO AND A QUARTER TO TWO AND A HALF CUPS OF LIQUID. NOW, THE POT THICKENS. NOW ONE OF THE NICE THINGS ABOUT ROUXS IS THEY DON'T HAVE A CONSCIENCE. THEY DON'T CARE WHAT LIQUID THEY THICKEN, THEY DON'T CARE WHERE IT CAME FROM, BUT THEY DO CARE HOW MUCH OF IT THERE IS. NOW I'M NOT MUCH FOR MEASURING. I DON'T LIKE GETTING OUT ALL THOSE LITTLE SPOONS. I LOSE COUNT. SO I THINK I'VE GOT A GOOD RULE OF THUMB BASED ON AN EQUAL AMOUNT OF RATIOS, ONE, ONE, ONE... AND IT'S ALL ABOUT WEIGHT. THE WAY I SEE IT IS THAT ONE CUP OF LIQUID CAN BE THICKENED BY ONE OUNCE OF FLOUR, AS LONG AS IT'S WITH ONE OUNCE OF BUTTER-- AND THAT'S BY WEIGHT. NOW SINCE I PLAN ON MAKING TWO CUPS OF GRAVY HERE, WE'RE GONNA BE TALKING ABOUT TWO OUNCES OF FLOUR AND TWO OUNCES OF BUTTER-- AGAIN, BY WEIGHT. SO WE GET THE GRAVY TRAIN STARTED HERE BY FIRING UP OUR SHINY NEW SAUCIER OVER MEDIUM HEAT. NOW WE WANT TO GO AHEAD AND GET THE BUTTER MELTED ALL THE WAY, BECAUSE WE WANT TO COMPLETELY COAT ALL THE GRAINS OF FLOUR WITH THE FAT. SO GET THAT MELTED. AND WHEN WE DO ADD THE FLOUR, WE WANT TO DO IT ALL AT ONCE. AND YOU WANT TO HAVE A WHISK IN YOUR HAND BEFORE YOU DO IT, BECAUSE OTHERWISE, WE'RE GONNA GET LUMPS IN THE ROUX. AND IF YOU GET LUMPS IN THE ROUX, UNFORTUNATELY, YOU'RE GONNA GET LUMPS IN YOUR GRAVY. SO THE BUTTER IS MELTED NOW. IT'S STARTING TO FOAM OUT, WHICH IS ABOUT WHERE WE WANT IT. AND GO AHEAD AND ADD THE FLOUR ALL AT ONCE. AND WHISK. THIS IS THE HARDEST WORK YOU'LL DO ON THIS DISH, I PROMISE. NOW I'M ALREADY REALLY LIKING THIS SAUCIER. YOU CAN SEE I CAN GET THE WHISK ALL THE WAY DOWN INTO THE CORNERS. THAT'S REALLY NICE. NOW AFTER ABOUT A MINUTE, MAYBE TWO MINUTES, OF STIRRING, DEPENDING ON YOUR BUTTER, YOU'RE GONNA NOTICE A CHANGE. THE ROUX'S ALL OF THE SUDDEN GONNA GET THINNER, AND IT'S GONNA KIND OF GET VERY LIQUIDOUS FOR A MOMENT. AND THAT'S GOOD, BECAUSE WHAT IT MEANS IS THAT YOU CAN TURN DOWN THE HEAT A LITTLE BIT, AND YOU CAN STOP STIRRING SO HARD. NOW WE'VE REACHED THE POINT WHERE THE ROUX IS ACTUALLY GOING TO COOK THE FLOUR. THIS IS WHERE ROUXS ARE SO MUCH BETTER AS THICKENERS THAN ANY OF THE OTHER THICKENING METHODS. YOU SEE, WITH A SLURRY, OR EVEN A BEURRE MANIé, YOU GOT TO COOK THE GRAVY FOR A LONG TIME TO GET THAT KIND OF RAW-CEREAL FLAVOR OUT OF YOUR MOUTH. ROUXS ARE ALREADY COOKED, SO YOU DON'T HAVE ANY OF THAT FLAVOR GOING IN. NOW AFTER ABOUT FIVE MINUTES, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE WHAT'S CALLED A WHITE ROUX, AND IT'S THE STRONGEST OF THE ROUXS. IT'LL THICKEN MORE LIQUID WITH A SMALLER AMOUNT THAN ANY OTHER ROUX. BUT THERE ARE OTHER DEGREES OF ROUX, AND THEY'RE EXTREMELY USEFUL IN THE KITCHEN. ROUXS CAN BE COOKED TO VARYING DEGREES OF DARKNESS, FROM LIGHT, TO BLOND, TO BRICK. HAVING ATTAINED SEVENTH- LEVEL ROUX MASTER STATUS, SOME CAJUN COOKS CAN ACTUALLY DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN A DOZEN DIFFERENT DEGREES OF DARKNESS. NOW THE DARKER A ROUX GETS, THE MORE COLOR AND FLAVOR IT WILL BRING TO A SAUCE OR GRAVY. BUT THE DARKER A ROUX IS, THE LESS THICKENING POWER IT HAS. A BRICK ROUX, FOR INSTANCE, ONLY HAS ABOUT A QUARTER OF THE THICKENING CAPACITY OF A WHITE ROUX. NOW IT TAKES A LONG, LONG COOKING TIME TO GET FROM THIS LEVEL OF ROUX TO THIS LEVEL OF ROUX. SO IF YOU WANT TO TRY YOUR HAND AT DARKER ROUXS, YOU MIGHT THINK ABOUT COOKING THEM IN THE OVEN, UNCOVERED, AT 350 . JUST GIVE 'EM AN OCCASIONAL STIR, BUT IT'S GONNA TAKE AT LEAST AN HOUR TO GET FROM HERE TO THERE. WELL, WE'VE REACHED ONE OF THE GREAT AXIOMS OF GRAVY MAKING. THE ROUX AND THE LIQUID TO BE THICKENED SHOULD BE AT OPPOSING TEMPERATURES, WITHOUT EITHER BEING ICE COLD. NOW OUR WHITE ROUX HAS COOLED DOWN TO ALMOST ROOM TEMPERATURE, BUT THE DEGLAZING LIQUID WE'VE BEEN REDUCING IS AT A FULL SIMMER, SO WE'RE ABOUT READY TO GO. WE'RE GONNA WHISK IN ABOUT HALF A CUP OF THE LIQUID INTO THE ROUX, AND WORK IT INTO A PASTE. THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT. IT'S GONNA HELP TO SEPARATE THE FLOUR GRAINS EVEN MORE AND KEEP THE GRAVY SMOOTH. NOW THE ROUX GOES BACK ONTO HIGH HEAT, ALONG WITH ALL BUT A QUARTER CUP OF THE LIQUID. AGAIN, BETTER TO END UP WITH A GRAVY THAT NEEDS THINNING THAN A THIN GRAVY THAT NEEDS THICKENING. WE'RE GONNA CALL THAT THE THIRD AXIOM. NOW ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS ABOUT FLOUR, AS OPPOSED TO, SAY, CORNSTARCH AS A THICKENER, IS THAT FLOUR STARTS TO WORK THICKENING WELL BELOW THE SIMMERING POINT, AROUND 150 . IF YOU KEEP STIRRING, BY THE TIME YOU SEE BUBBLES BREAK THE SURFACE, YOU'LL BE FULLY THICKENED. NOW THE FIRST FEW TIMES YOU MAKE GRAVY, YOU'RE GONNA BE SURPRISED HOW SUDDEN THIS HAPPENS. YOU CAN SERVE IT AS SOON AS YOU LIKE THE TEXTURE. BUT, IF YOU KEEP IT OVER A VERY LOW SIMMER FOR HALF AN HOUR TO AN HOUR, THE SAUCE WILL BECOME MUCH SMOOTHER. PROTEINS AND FATS FROM THE FLOUR AND BUTTER WILL EVENTUALLY WORK UP TO THE SURFACE, WHERE YOU CAN SKIN THEM OFF EASILY. SO IF YOU HAVE TIME, TAKE THE TIME, THE SAUCE WILL THANK YOU. NOW A HEALTHY GRAVY SHOULD HOLD ON TO FOOD WITHOUT WEIGHING IT DOWN. THIS LOOKS PERFECT AT THE MOMENT. THE TROUBLE IS, BY THE TIME I GET THIS IN THE GRAVY BOAT, DOWN THE HALL, INTO THE DINING ROOM AND SIT DOWN, THIS GRAVY WILL HAVE COOLED DOWN BY SEVERAL DEGREES, AND SAUCES THICKENED BY FLOUR THICKEN MORE AS THEY COOL. THAT'S AXIOM NUMBER FOUR. WE'VE ALL SEEN IT AT THANKSGIVING, RIGHT? BY THE TIME YOU GET THE PLATES BACK TO THE KITCHEN, THE KIDS ARE KICKING THE GRAVY AROUND THE LIVING ROOM. SO THIN IT OUT JUST A LITTLE BIT TO MAKE UP FOR THE INEVITABLE TIGHTENING. AND NOW IS THE LAST TIME YOU'LL HAVE TO GIVE IT A FINAL TASTE. IT TASTES GOOD TO ME. AND MY LAST GRAVY NOTE IS ABOUT PRESENTATION. I'LL ADMIT, I'M NOT ONE FOR GARNISH, BUT AFTER ALL THIS WORK, YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T SERVE THIS UP IN AN EMPTY MAYONNAISE JAR... SO GET YOURSELF A GRAVY BOAT. I MEAN, ASK YOUR GRANDMOTHER FOR ONE. SHE'S PROBABLY GOT ONE SHE'D BE HAPPY TO GIVE YOU. 'CAUSE WHEN IT COMES TO SOME THINGS, DETAILS MATTER MOST. ♪ YOU KNOW, IT WAS IN ROADSIDE DINERS JUST LIKE THIS THAT THE WORD GRAVY BECAME SYNONYMOUS WITH EASILY OR ILL-GOTTEN GAINS. WHAT MANNER OF SAUCE COULD POSSIBLY INSPIRE SUCH A UNIVERSAL COLLOQUIALISM? ... MILK GRAVY, MY FRIEND. OR AS IT'S CALLED IN THE SOUTH... SAWMILL GRAVY. HERE'S HOW. FOR TWO CUPS OF SAWMILL GRAVY, START BY FRYING UP SOMETHING LIKE COUNTRY STEAK, CHICKEN OR A BATCH OF BREAKFAST SAUSAGE. IF YOU'VE GOT MORE THAN ABOUT TWO TABLESPOONS OF FAT LEFT IN THE PAN, POUR IT OFF. THIS IS ABOUT RIGHT. WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T LOSE ANY OF THOSE LITTLE BROWN BITS AND PIECES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PAN, OTHERWISE KNOWN AS "THE GOOD STUFF." PUT THE PAN BACK OVER MEDIUM-HIGH HEAT AND THEN SPRINKLE OVER ABOUT A QUARTER CUP OF FLOUR... ABOUT FOUR TABLESPOONS. THEN WHISK OR STIR WITH VIGOR FOR A GOOD 30 SECONDS, SCRAPING AROUND ALL THOSE LITTLE BROWN BITS, 'CAUSE THAT IS WHERE THE FLAVOR IS. WE'RE GONNA LET THIS COOK FOR ABOUT ANOTHER TWO MINUTES, JUST TO GET RID OF THAT FLOURY, RAW-CEREAL TASTE. THREE MINUTES LATER, WE'VE GOT A NICE, KIND OF NUTTY AROMA. SO I'M GONNA TAKE IT OFF THE HEAT, AND I'M GONNA SWITCH OVER TO A WHISK. AND I'M GOING TO ADD SLOWLY, IN INSTALLMENTS, TWO CUPS OF MILK. I'M JUST GONNA WORK EACH LITTLE INSTALLMENT IN. DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE BUBBLING. IT'S GONNA GET REAL THICK AND UGLY, BUT THAT'S OKAY. THAT'S ABOUT A HALF A CUP WORKED IN. JUST TRY TO GET UP INTO ALL THOSE CORNERS. YOU COULD DO THIS WITH A SPOON, I JUST LIKE THE WHISK. OKAY, THAT'S ABOUT TWO CUPS. AND YOU GO BACK OVER HIGH HEAT. WE WANT TO GET THIS UP TO A SIMMER AS SOON AS WE CAN, BECAUSE THERE'S, HEY, NO REASON TO WAIT. ONCE YOU'VE GOT IT ALL WORKED IN, IF YOU WANT, YOU CAN GO BACK TO THE SPOON SO YOU DON'T SCRAPE UP YOUR PAN. I'M KIND OF PARTIAL TO THIS PAN, SO I'M JUST GONNA STIR IT. AND AS SOON AS IT COMES UP TO A SIMMER, IT'LL BE AS THICK AS IT'S GONNA BE. NOW SAWMILL GRAVY'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE A GLOPPY, HEAVY SAUCE. AND SINCE IT'S GONNA BE WORKED IN WITH ALL THIS CRUMPLED SAUSAGE WE'RE GONNA USE, WE JUST WANT A NICE, KIND OF VELVETY CONSISTENCY. AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT, EVEN WITH A RUSTIC DISH LIKE THIS, YOU CAN GET THAT CONSISTENCY. YOU CAN SEE THE GRAVY'S JUST COMING UP TO A SIMMER, AND IT'S THICKENING NICELY. I DON'T WANT IT TO BE SUPER THICK, I JUST WANT IT TO BE KIND OF ENOUGH TO COAT. YOU CAN SEE THAT I'VE HELD BACK A LITTLE BIT OF THAT MILK. THAT'S BECAUSE, AS ALWAYS, A THICK GRAVY IS A LOT EASIER TO THIN THAN THE OTHER WAY AROUND. FROM THE LOOKS OF THIS, I THINK I'M GONNA LEAVE IT OUT. I'M JUST GOING TO GIVE IT A TASTE... NO DOUBLE-DIPPING. THERE WAS PLENTY OF SALT IN THE SAUSAGE. THERE WAS SOME RED PEPPER IN THE SAUSAGE, SO ACTUALLY, THIS IS SEASONED REALLY NICE. SINCE WE'VE COME TO A SIMMER, THAT'S AS THICK AS IT'S GONNA GET... OF COURSE, UNTIL IT COOLS DOWN. SO SERVE IT A LITTLE BIT THIN, AND YOU'LL BE REWARDED WITH PERFECT CONSISTENCY. NOW SERVE IMMEDIATELY OVER TOAST WITH, SAY, THE AFOREMENTIONED SAUSAGE, NOW CRUMBLED, AND BEHOLD, A MEAL TO BREAK A TRUCKER'S HEART. NOW THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN EVEN BETTER OVER FRESHLY BAKED BISCUITS, BUT THAT'S ANOTHER SHOW. WHEN MADE WITH A BUTTER ROUX, THIS GRAVY IS THE SAUCE THE FRENCH CALL BéCHAMEL. AND IN THE SAUCE WORLD, BéCHAMEL BASICALLY TRANSLATES TO PLASTIC, BECAUSE IT CAN BE TURNED INTO SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS. ADD SHREDDED ONION OR SHALLOTS, AND YOU'VE GOT SAUCE SOUBISE, WHICH IS GREAT ON JUST ABOUT ANYTHING. ADD A PINCH OF CAYENNE, SOME SHREDDED GRUYERE AND PARMESAN, AND YOU'VE GOT SAUCE MORNAY, READY AND WILLING TO POUR ITSELF OVER VEGETABLE, EGGS OR FISH. TRADE THE FANCY CHEESE FOR GOOD OLD AMERICAN CHEDDAR, AND YOU'VE GOT, YOU GUESSED IT, CHEDDAR SAUCE. MIX THIS WITH COOKED MACARONI, BAKE IT AT 350 FOR 15 OR 20 MINUTES, AND YOU'VE GOT A SMOOTH MACARONI AND CHEESE THAT WILL NOT SPLIT ON YOU. AND THEN LAST, ADD THE CRUMBLED SAUSAGE TO THE BéCHAMEL, AND WE'RE BACK WHERE WE BEGAN, SAWMILL GRAVY. IT MAY NOT LOOK VERY FANCY OR SOUND VERY FANCY, BUT IT IS DEFINITELY GOOD EATS. AS YOU CAN SEE, BéCHAMEL IS THE MOTHER OF MANY SAUCES. ♪ KNOWING HOW TO MAKE SIMPLE GRAVIES AND SAUCES IS KIND OF LIKE FINDING THE PERFECT LITTLE BLACK DRESS OR NAVY BLAZER... IT CHANGES THE WHOLE LOOK OF YOUR WARDROBE. NOW AS SOON AS YOU'RE COMFORTABLE WITH THE WHOLE ROUX/ LIQUID EQUATION, THE WORLD IS YOUR SAUCEPAN. BéCHAMEL MAKES THE PERFECT CASSEROLE BINDER. CANNED TOMATOES THICKENED WITH A LITTLE ROUX ON BISCUITS-- IT'S DINNER, IN MY BOOK. AND THAT AMERICAN GOTHIC CLASSIC, RED-EYE GRAVY, IS LITTLE MORE THAN HAM DRIPPINGS, FLOUR AND COFFEE. IT'S DOWN-HOME COOKING EVEN A BEATNIK COULD LOVE. THE POINT IS, YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE FANCY FRENCH RECIPES TO MAKE SAUCE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO WAIT FOR THANKSGIVING TO MAKE GRAVY. AND HOPEFULLY, YOU CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT EPISODE OF "GOOD EATS."
