 YA KNOW, I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY
 JOHN WAYNE ATE STEAK.
 I MEAN, IF THERE'S A MEAL MORE FUNDAMENTALLY AMERICAN,
 WE CAN'T THINK OF IT.
 STEAK IS A FOOD BORN OF WIDE-OPEN SPACES
 AND BIG SKIES.
 EVEN TODAY, WHEN THE CLOSEST MOST OF US COME TO A HORSE
 IS THE SADDLE ON AN EXERCISE BIKE,
 STEAK STILL CALLS OUT TO THOSE WITH BRAVE APPETITES.
 NOW SADLY, FIRING UP A STEAK AT HOME CAN END IN DISAPPOINTMENT.
 SURE, WE CAN TAKE REFUGE IN A GREAT AMERICAN STEAKHOUSE,
 BUT SOMETHING SO ELEMENTAL
 SHOULDN'T BE ALIEN TO THE HOME PLATE,
 AND IT SHOULDN'T COST AN ARM AND A LEG.
 SO JOIN US AS WE SEARCH OUT THE GREAT AMERICAN STEAK.
 WE'RE GONNA LEARN WHAT TO LOOK FOR, WHERE TO FIND IT.
 WE'RE GONNA OUTFIT OURSELVES WITH SOME DECENT GEAR.
 AND WHEN WE BAG OUR PREY,
 WE'RE GONNA COOK IT UP THE WAY WE LIKE IT BEST,
 NICE AND SIMPLE.
 SO HITCH UP APPETITE... THIS IS "GOOD EATS."
 ♪
 FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT MIGHT'VE GROWN UP IN THE CITY,
 THESE ARE CATTLE.
 AND THIS IS A STEER, OR AT LEAST A DRAWING OF ONE.
 NOW STEERS ARE WHERE ALL GREAT STEAK STARTS.
 NOW STEER IS BASICALLY A BULL THAT'S BEEN...
 WELL, LET'S JUST SAY THEY DON'T MAKE MUCH TIME WITH THE LADIES.
 OH, HERE COMES MEL COLEMAN.
 HE JUST HAPPENS TO RAISE ORGANIC CATTLE
 ON A FEW HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES OUT IN COLORADO.
 GOOD MORNING, MEL. WELL, GOOD MORNING, ALTON.
 GOOD TO SEE YA. GOOD TO SEE YOU.
 WE'RE ON A HUNT FOR A GREAT STEAK.
 WE GOT A ROAD MAP GOING... WILL YOU HELP US?
 WELL, THERE'S GOOD STEAKS ALL OVER A STEER,
 BUT THE BEST STEAKS ARE RIGHT IN HERE. OKAY.
 NOW WHEN YOU QUARTER AN ANIMAL, YOU QUARTER IT RIGHT THROUGH THERE,
 SO ALL OF THIS FRONT PART
 IS A LITTLE FATTIER THAN FROM HERE BACK.
 THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN IT TASTES BETTER, THOUGH, RIGHT?
 I DON'T THINK SO, 'CAUSE A LOT OF THE TASTE
 COMES FROM A STEAK THAT'S VERY LEAN, LIKE THE SIRLOIN. OKAY.
 A JUICER STEAK, BECAUSE IT HAS MORE FAT AND MARBLING,
 COMES FROM THE RIB-EYE. OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
 SO BASICALLY, YOUR BETTER STEAKS
 ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ANIMAL ON THE BACK.
 YEAH, UP TOWARD THE BACK. SO WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES GRASS MAKE?
 WELL, I THINK THIS GRASS, LIKE THIS...
 I THINK THAT'S THE BEST THING THERE IS.
 YOU KNOW, 65 PERCENT OF THE LAND MASS OF THE WORLD IS GRASS.
 WE CAN'T EAT IT... I DON'T LIKE IT IN MY SALAD, ANYWAY.
 WELL, NO, IT'S A LITTLE TOUGH. BEIN' OUR COWS ARE VEGETARIAN,
 THEY SPEND MOST OF THEIR LIFE EATIN' THIS GRASS.
 WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE STEAK?
 IF YOU COULD HAVE ONE, JUST ONE?
 I'D TAKE THE STRIP STEAK.
 NOW THAT'S THE TOP PART OF THE T-BONE.
 THE OTHER PART OF THE T-BONE'S VERY TENDER.
 MOST WOMEN LIKE IT, BUT JUST BECAUSE IT'S TENDER.
 WE CAN'T SAY THAT KIND OF STUFF NOW, THAT WOMEN STUFF.
 OH, THAT'S RIGHT. THEY GET REALLY KIND OF...
 A LOT OF PEOPLE JUST LIKE IT 'CAUSE IT'S SOFT AND TENDER. TENDER, OKAY.
 HOW DO YOU COOK YOURS? MEDIUM RARE.
 MEDIUM RARE. OH, YEAH, YOU DON'T WANT TO COOK IT ANYMORE THAN THAT.
 YOU LIKE MY DRAWING, YOU LIKE MY CATTLE DRAWING?
 YEAH, THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD SQUARE COW.
 WOULD A STEER HAVE A NOSE RING?
 NOT ON OUR RANCH, NO. NOT ON YOUR RANCH.
 AND THESE ARE ANTENNAS, I GUESS, AM AND FM... ?
 YEAH, THOSE ARE ANTENNAS, MEL.
 THANKS A LOT, MEL, THAT MAKES ME FEEL GREAT!
 YOU ARE A HECK OF AN ARTIST, THOUGH!
 MEL, THANK YOU. YOU BET.
 GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN, ALTON. SEE YA SOON.
 OH, SURE, THAT LOOKS EASY, RIGHT?
 WELL, DON'T GET TOO COCKY,
 BECAUSE JUST A FEW MILES UP THE ROAD
 IS A PLACE THAT CAN REDUCE AN UNSUSPECTING COOK
 TO A QUIVERING ZOMBIE.
 ♪
 SUBMITTED FOR YOUR APPROVAL,
 HUNDREDS OF MYSTERIOUS PIECES MEAT,
 EACH ONE AN ENIGMA IN SHRINK WRAP.
 CHOOSE WISELY AND DISCOVER NIRVANA.
 CHOOSE POORLY, AND YOUR DREAMS OF A JUICY STEAK DISINTEGRATE
 INTO A DRY PILE OF GRIZZLE.
 HOW WILL YOU CHOOSE?
 NOW THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL SIGHT, REAL LIVE BUTCHERS.
 THESE FOLKS ARE PROOF POSITIVE
 THAT WE ARE NOT ALONE IN THE MEAT UNIVERSE.
 THEY'RE HERE TO HELP... THEY'LL ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS.
 IF THERE'S ANY CHANCE THAT YOU COULD WANT SOMETHING YOU DON'T SEE,
 ODDS ARE THEY'RE GONNA GET IT FOR YA.
 LET'S GO TALK TO ONE.
 THIS IS JOE, HE'S A BUTCHER.
 HE IS THE MAN... HE GREW UP IN THE BUSINESS.
 HE COULD TAKE A STEER APART AND PUT IT BACK TOGETHER,
 AND IT WOULD WALK AWAY.
 JOE, WE'RE TRYING TO FIND A PERFECT STEAK.
 WHAT SHOULD SOMEBODY LOOK FOR AS FAR AS QUALITY GOES?
 YOU CAN SEE IN THE STEAK WE JUST CUT A FEW MINUTES AGO,
 THEY ARE STILL HOLDING THE MOISTURE.
 OH, YEAH, IT'S COMING RIGHT UP OUT OF THE MEAT.
 AND THAT IS WHAT YOU HAVE TO LOOK FOR
 WHEN YOU GO TO THE GROCERY STORE, TO SEE THE MOISTURE.
 AND THE COLOR HAS TO BE BRIGHT,
 IT HAS TO BE THE SAME ON BOTH SIDES.
 OKAY, SO... AT THE SAME TIME, EXCUSE ME.
 AT THE SAME TIME, WHEN THE STEAK IS CUT,
 IT HAS TO BE CUT EVEN.
 ONE OF THE REASONS WE DO THAT IS
 BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T CUT EVEN,
 IT WILL NOT COOK EVEN. OKAY, NO SMELL.
 NO SMELL. NOTHING?
 THIS MEANS IT'S FRESH.
 SO LET ME SEE IF I GOT THIS STRAIGHT...
 WE GOT THE SIRLOIN PRIMAL, RIGHT?
 ♪
 AND FROM THAT YOU CAN CUT THESE BIG FRED FLINTSTONE STEAKS HERE...
 TENDER, AS LONG AS YOU DON'T OVERCOOK IT.
 THEN WE MOVE ON TO THE MIDDLE OF THE ANIMAL,
 AND THE SHORT LOIN.
 AND THIS IS THE SHORT LOIN KIND OF IN ITS ENTIRETY.
 YOU CAN SEE THE CROSS SECTION
 OF A PORTERHOUSE STEAK,
 AND THAT TRANSLATES TO THIS, RIGHT? RIGHT.
 NOW IF WE WERE TO CUT
 THIS PIECE AND THIS PIECE AWAY,
 WE WOULD HAVE THIS STRIP,
 AND WE WOULD HAVE THIS TENDERLOIN.
 OKAY, SO IF WE'VE GOT A PORTERHOUSE,
 WHICH IS BASICALLY A STRIP STEAK
 AND A FILLET ADDED TOGETHER, RIGHT? RIGHT.
 KIND OF LIKE THIS. RIGHT.
 IF YOU HAD A BONE THERE, THAT WOULD BE A PORTERHOUSE. RIGHT.
 FOUR DIFFERENT STEAKS THAT CAN COME OFF OF ONE PRIMAL
 CAN COME OFF OF THE SHORT LOIN...
 STRIP, T-BONE,
 PORTERHOUSE AND FILLET.
 AND MOST OF US ARE USED TO HAVING THIS ONE
 WITH A NICE PIECE OF BACON TIED AROUND IT.
 AND THEN WE'VE GOT MY FAVORITE, THE RIB PRIMAL.
 AND FROM THAT WE GET THE WONDERFUL RIB-EYE STEAK.
 IF YOU WERE TO PUT A BONE ON THIS, IT WOULD BE PRIME RIB.
 NOW IT'S GOT SOME NICE MARBLING IN IT...
 ♪
 ... WHICH IS A LITTLE EXTRA FAT,
 BUT IF YOU COOK IT RIGHT, IF YOU COOK IT REALLY HOT,
 A LOT OF THAT FAT COMES OUT.
 THE FARTHER THE CUT IS FROM THE HEAD, THE HORNS AND THE HOOF,
 THE MORE TENDER IT'S GONNA BE,
 WHEREAS YOU GET CLOSER TO THE LEGS IN THE ANIMAL,
 THE ANIMAL DOES MORE WORK--MORE FLAVOR,
 BUT A LITTLE TOUGHER.
 SO THANKS TO JOE, WE ARE SET UP WITH A JUICY RIB-EYE.
 THANKS. THERE YOU ARE, SIR.
 HEY, HOW DO YOU LIKE YOUR STEAK? CHARRED, MEDIUM RARE.
 SAUCE? BéARNAISE.
 SWEET!
 OH, YA KNOW, I'VE BEEN ASKING EVERYBODY AROUND HERE
 ABOUT THIS WHOLE USDA INSPECTING THING,
 BUT THEY KEEP TELLING ME TO ASK THE FEDS.
 ALL BEEF PROCESSED FOR COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
 IN THE UNITED STATES IS OVERSEEN
 BY UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE INSPECTORS,
 WHO ENSURE THAT SLAUGHTER TAKES PLACE
 UNDER WHOLESOME AND SANITARY CONDITIONS,
 AND THAT CARCASSES ARE FREE
 FROM ANY APPARENT DISEASE OR INJURY.
 THIS INSPECTION IS MANDATORY.
 GRADING, HOWEVER, IS A VOLUNTARY PROCESS,
 PAID FOR BY THE PACKER OR PROCESSOR.
 GRADES, SUCH AS SELECT, CHOICE AND PRIME,
 ARE A FUNCTION OF COLOR, WEIGHT, FAT-TO-BODY RATIO,
 AGE AND OTHER PHYSICAL CONSIDERATIONS.
 NONGRADED OR NO-ROLL MEAT IS NOT NECESSARILY AN INFERIOR PRODUCT.
 THE PROCESSOR OR PACKER HAS SIMPLY OPTED TO SAVE MONEY
 BY FOREGOING THE PROCESS.
 PARDON ME, SIR, PLEASE STEP AWAY FROM THE STEER.
 (moooooooo)
 NOW WE MIGHT NOT LIKE TO THINK ABOUT IT,
 BUT ALL MEAT--HECK, ALL FOOD--
 IS PRETTY MUCH FULL OF MICROORGANISMS.
 THERE, I'VE SAID IT.
 NOW MOST OF THESE LITTLE GUYS ARE PERFECTLY HARMLESS,
 BUT SOME BACTERIA,
 LIKE LISTERIA, E. COLI AND SALMONELLA,
 CAN DO SERIOUS BODILY HARM.
 THEY CAN EVEN LAND YOU IN THAT BIG KITCHEN IN THE SKY.
 NOW THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU GOT TO TREAT ALL RED MEAT
 OR WHITE MEAT OR POULTRY
 LIKE IT'S ASBESTOS,
 BUT YOU DO HAVE TO FOLLOW SOME SIMPLE RULES.
 FOR ONE, YOU CAN'T JUST STICK IT IN YOUR TRUNK
 AND GO SEE A MOVIE,
 UNLESS, OF COURSE, YOU LIVE IN MINNESOTA AND IT'S JANUARY.
 BELIEVE ME, BACTERIA BREED LIKE BUNNIES.
 SO YOU WANT TO GET THIS STUFF HOME
 AND INTO THE COLDEST PART OF YOUR FRIDGE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
 NOW I LIKE THE BOTTOM DRAWER.
 NOW YOUR REFRIGERATOR SHOULD NEVER
 GET MORE THAN 40 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT.
 FOR OUR EUROPEAN FRIENDS, THAT'S, AH...
 LET THEM DO THEIR OWN MATH!
 NOW IF YOU'RE IN DOUBT, SPEND A FEW BUCKS
 AND GET YOURSELF A REFRIGERATOR THERMOMETER.
 THIS IS CHEAP INSURANCE.
 AND BELIEVE ME, WHEN YOU THROW THAT BIG DINNER PARTY,
 WHAT YOU WANT TO GET IN THE MAIL IS THANK-YOU NOTES,
 NOT A COURT SUMMONS.
 ♪
 NOW WHEN IT COMES TO COOKING GEAR,
 IT TOUGH TO GET MUCH MORE BASIC THAN A PAN.
 IF YOU'RE NOT REAL SURE WHERE A PAN ENDS AND A POT BEGINS,
 JUST REMEMBER THAT A PAN ALWAYS HAS ONE STRAIGHT HANDLE,
 AND A POT HAS LOOP HANDLES
 AND ALMOST ALWAYS COMES WITH A LID,
 WHICH IS NOT TO SAY THAT YOU CAN'T HAVE A PAN WITH A LID.
 NOW THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF PANS OUT THERE,
 DESIGNED FOR ALL KINDS OF JOBS
 AND MADE OUT OF ALL KINDS OF STUFF.
 BUT IF COOKING'S GONNA BE FUN,
 AND WE'RE HERE TO SEE THAT IT IS,
 YOU'VE GOTTA HAVE THE RIGHT TOOL FOR THE JOB.
 AND SINCE WORKING IN A CLUTTERED, JUNKED-UP KITCHEN
 IS ABOUT AS MUCH FUN AS COMING DOWN WITH EBOLA,
 YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PIECES YOU HAVE ARE VERSATILE.
 NOW SURE, THERE ARE PLENTY OF PANS THAT CAN HANDLE A STEAK,
 BUT THE ONE THAT'S BEST AT IT
 JUST HAPPENS TO BE THE KIND OF KITCHEN ESSENTIAL
 THAT YOU SHOULD NOT LIVE WITHOUT,
 AND FOR UNDER $20, YOU DON'T HAVE TO.
 TO DO OUR RIB-EYE JUSTICE, WE REALLY NEED A PAN
 THAT GETS REALLY HOT.
 IT'S GOTTA STAY HOT,
 AND IT'S GOTTA DISTRIBUTE THAT HEAT EVENLY.
 WHAT WE NEED IS CAST IRON.
 NOW UNLIKE A LOT OF QUALITY KITCHEN WARES,
 THIS ONE YOU CAN FIND IN SOME UNLIKELY PLACES.
 SAY YOU STOP OFF AT YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD HARDWARE STORE...
 YOU'RE LOOKIN' FOR A NEW SAWSALL, OR I DON'T KNOW,
 MAYBE YOU NEED SOME TELEPHONE WIRE,
 OR MAYBE A TALKING YARD FROG, LIKE THAT.
 CHANCES ARE, IF YOU LOOK AROUND,
 YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO SCOPE A DEAL ON...
 AH! CAST IRON SKILLET.
 LIKE SAY THIS TEN-INCH MODEL RIGHT HERE.
 ANYTHING SMALLER THAN THIS IS KIND OF AWKWARD TO USE,
 AND ANYTHING BIGGER THAN, SAY, THIS 12-INCHER,
 AND YOU NEED A TEAM OF OXEN JUST TO MOVE IT AROUND.
 TAKE A LOOK AROUND YOUR GRANDMOTHER'S KITCHEN.
 I PROMISE YOU, THERE'S AT LEAST ONE OF THESE.
 'CAUSE BACK IN THE DAYS BEFORE TEFLON
 AND EXTRUDED, ANNODIZED ALUMINUM
 AND SURGICAL STAINLESS STEEL, THIS IS WHAT YOU COOKED IN--
 THREE MEALS A DAY.
 IT'S SOLID IRON.
 IT CAN GO IN THE OVEN, ON THE STOVE, UNDER A BROILER,
 OVER A CAMPFIRE, OVER A JET ENGINE, WHATEVER--
 IN SHORT, A VERY VERSATILE PIECE OF COOKWARE.
 AND IT'S OUR VESSEL OF CHOICE FOR LOTS OF JOBS,
 FROM COOKIN' A STEAK TO CHICKEN PICCATA,
 TO PANCAKES, TO CORN BREAD.
 THIS IS AN UNFINISHED IRON SURFACE, OKAY?
 AND IT'S GOT TO BE CONDITIONED OR CURED WHEN IT'S NEW,
 SO THAT FOOD WON'T STICK.
 IF YOU'VE BEEN LUCKY ENOUGH TO INHERIT ONE OF THESE,
 OR PICK ONE UP AT, SAY, A GARAGE SALE,
 YOU KNOW THAT IT'S GONNA TURN BLACK, WHICH IS GOOD.
 NOW JUST TO CHECK OUT YOUR GRANDMA'S SKILLET...
 IF IT'S NOT JET BLACK AND SLICK AS A MAMBO BAND,
 SHE'S BEEN SNEAKING IN TAKEOUT ALL THESE YEARS.
 OH, HEY BOB, COME HERE A SECOND.
 COULD YOU TELL US SOMETHING ABOUT CURING UP THIS BAD BOY? SURE.
 WELL, THE FIRST THING YOU WANT TO DO WHEN YOU BRING IT HOME
 IS WASH IT IN WARM SOAPY WATER.
 YOU DON'T WANT TO USE A SCOURING PAD,
 BECAUSE IT'LL SCRATCH UP THE SURFACE. OKAY.
 YOU LIGHTLY COAT IT WITH VEGETABLE OIL,
 PUT IT IN THE OVEN, 350 DEGREES, FOR ABOUT AN HOUR. ALL RIGHT.
 THEN TAKE IT OUT, POUR OUT ANY EXCESS GREASE,
 LIGHTLY WIPE IT DOWN... COVER IT WITH A PAPER TOWEL.
 HOW DO YOU LIKE YOUR STEAK, BOB? I DON'T EAT STEAK.
 HOW DOES YOUR WIFE LIKE HER STEAK, BOB? WE DON'T EAT RED MEAT.
 HOW DO YOUR KIDS LIKE THEIR STEAK, BOB? THEY DON'T EAT RED MEAT.
 THANKS, BOB!
 SINCE WE'RE GONNA BE FINISHING OUR STEAK IN A 500 DEGREE OVEN,
 THERE'S NO REASON NOT TO CHUCK THIS GUY IN
 AND GIVE HIM A HEAD START.
 IT'S CAST IRON, IT DOESN'T CARE.
 AND HERE AT "GOOD EATS,"
 WE DON'T LIKE A LOT OF FANCY FLAVORS MESSIN' WITH OUR BEEF,
 JUST A LITTLE GROUND PEPPER AND A LITTLE KOSHER SALT.
 AND DON'T WORRY, THE SALT ON THE MEAT
 IS NOT GONNA PULL OUT ALL THE JUICES AHEAD OF TIME.
 BESIDES, IT'S GONNA GO STRAIGHT INTO A HOT PAN.
 NOW A WORD ABOUT SALT...
 WARS HAVE BEEN STARTED OVER IT.
 GANDHI'S FAMED MARCH TO THE SEA WAS ABOUT MAKING SALT.
 IT'S MENTIONED MORE TIMES IN THE BIBLE THAN ANY OTHER SEASONING,
 AND YET, NOT ALL SALT IS ALIKE.
 THIS IS SEA SALT, WHICH IS MADE FROM EVAPORATED SEA WATER.
 IT COMES IN A FINE GRIND AND ALSO IN CRYSTALS.
 AND IT TASTES GREAT, BUT IT'S KIND OF PRICEY.
 IT'S DEFINITELY FOR COOKS WHO DRIVE PORSCHES.
 NOW, ROCK SALT...
 THIS IS NOT THE STUFF YOU PUT ON YOUR DRIVEWAY IN WINTER.
 IT'S OKAY, IT'S GOT SOME EXTRA MINERALS IN IT,
 WHICH WON'T DO YOU ANY HARM,
 BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE A GRINDER FOR IT,
 AND I HAVE A HARD TIME JUST KEEPING UP WITH A PEPPER GRINDER.
 THIS IS GOOD OL' TABLE SALT.
 IT'S GOT IODINE ADDED TO IT SO YOU WON'T GET A GOITER.
 I KNOW THAT'S A MAJOR CONCERN.
 THIS STUFF'S GOT ANTI- CLUMPING ADDITIVES,
 WHICH, WELL, KEEP IT FROM CLUMPING.
 I DON'T LIKE WORKING WITH IT BECAUSE IT'S HARD TO PINCH,
 IT'S HARD TO CONTROL.
 I THINK IT JUST TASTES FUNNY.
 KOSHER SALT NOT ONLY TASTES GREAT,
 BUT THE JAGGED LITTLE FLAKES STICK TOGETHER,
 SO THAT YOU CAN PICK IT UP AND CONTROL IT,
 WHICH HELPS YOU SEASON THINGS.
 NOW THESE FLAKES ALSO WILL STICK TO THE OUTSIDE OF OUR STEAK
 AND HELP GIVE US THAT CRUST WE'RE AFTER.
 TABLE SALT WILL JUST DISSOLVE WHEN IT HITS THE PAN.
 KOSHER SALT IS A PANTRY ESSENTIAL.
 FOR GOODNESS SAKES, KEEP IT NEAR YOU ALWAYS.
 ♪
 WE HAVE PLUCKED OUR PAN FROM THE 500 DEGREE OVEN,
 BUT IT'S STILL NOT HOT ENOUGH,
 SO I'M GONNA PUT IT OVER HIGH HEAT AND LEAVE IT THERE
 FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER FIVE MINUTES.
 NOW THIS THING'S A BRANDING IRON AT THIS POINT, OKAY,
 SO PLEASE HANDLE IT WITH A FOLDED TOWEL OR A POT HOLDER,
 OR SOMETHING, OR ELSE YOU'RE GONNA END UP IN THE BURN WARD.
 NOW TO THE STEAK...
 A LITTLE SEASONING--WE'RE GONNA USE A GOOD BIT OF KOSHER SALT.
 BELIEVE ME, THIS ISN'T TOO MUCH.
 GOT TO HAVE SOME ON BOTH SIDES--
 YOU REALLY WANT IT ON THERE.
 A COUPLE OF TURNS OF BLACK PEPPER...
 NOW WE WANT TO LUBE UP THE MEAT A LITTLE BIT WITH SOME OIL.
 THIS IS GONNA HELP THE HEAT GET INTO THE NOOKS AND CRANNIES
 AND GIVE US THAT BROWN CRUST WE'RE AFTER.
 IT ONLY TAKES A FEW DROPS.
 AND JUST KIND OF TOSS IT AROUND ON THE PLATE A BIT,
 JUST TO GIVE THE MEAT A NICE GLISTEN.
 THERE, NOW, INTO THE PAN.
 HERE'S THE POINT WHERE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO TRUST ME.
 DO NOT TOUCH THIS FOR 30 SECONDS.
 BECAUSE WE'RE COOKING WITH SUCH HIGH HEAT,
 THE KIND OF OIL WE USE IS KIND OF IMPORTANT.
 YA SEE, EVERY FAT HAS A TEMPERATURE AT WHICH IT BURNS
 AND GETS NASTY TASTING.
 IT'S CALLED THE SMOKE POINT, AND SURE ENOUGH,
 IT'S THE TEMPERATURE AT WHICH ANY GIVEN OIL STARTS SMOKING.
 WE NEVER COULD USE BUTTER OR EXPENSIVE EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL FOR THIS,
 BECAUSE IT BURNS REALLY EASILY.
 A LITTLE HIGHER UP THE SCALE YOU GET CORN OIL
 AND CANOLA, WHICH ARE OKAY.
 BUT UP AT THE TOP OF THE SCALE ARE OILS
 LIKE PEANUT OIL AND SAFFLOWER OIL,
 AND THEY ARE PERFECT FOR HIGH-HEAT COOKING
 LIKE SEARING AND SAUTéING.
 IT'S BEEN 30 SECONDS, SO I'M GO AHEAD AND FLIP THIS OVER.
 NOW SEE, THAT BROWN CRUST, THAT'S WHAT WE'RE AFTER,
 SO WE'RE GONNA LEAVE IT FOR ANOTHER 30 SECONDS.
 A LOT OF COMPLEX PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY STUFF
 GOES ON DURING SEARING, BUT, HEY, I WANT TO EAT,
 NOT WRITE A DISSERTATION.
 SO HERE IT IS IN SIMPLE TERMS.
 YOU NEED A REALLY HOT PAN,
 A LITTLE BIT OF FAT ON THE MEAT,
 AND THE PATIENCE TO LEAVE IT ALONE TO DEVELOP THAT NICE BROWN CRUST.
 NOW IT'S BEEN ANOTHER 30 SECONDS,
 AND WE'VE GOT A REALLY GREAT CRUST ON BOTH SIDES.
 BUT THE INSIDE OF THE MEAT IS STILL NOT DONE,
 SO I'M GONNA MOVE THE WHOLE THING INTO THE OVEN--
 RIGHT IN THE 500 DEGREE OVEN.
 I'M GONNA LEAVE THAT IN THERE FOR TWO MINUTES,
 AND THEN I'M GONNA FLIP IT AND LET IT FINISH ANOTHER TWO.
 WHY BOTHER, YOU ASK?
 WHY NOT JUST DO THE WHOLE THING ON THE BURNER?
 WELL, IF I DID, BY THE TIME THE MEAT WAS DONE ON THE INSIDE,
 THAT NICE BROWN CRUST WE'VE GOT WORKING FOR US
 WOULD BE PRETTY MUCH A BLACK SHELL.
 BY DOING IT THIS WAY,
 WE LET THE RELATIVELY LOWER HEAT INSIDE THE OVEN
 MOVE INTO THE MEAT AND FINISH IT GENTLY.
 YA KNOW, I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE INTIMIDATED BY STEAK
 BECAUSE OF THE WHOLE DONENESS/TEMPERATURE THING.
 BUT CONTRARY TO POPULAR LEGEND,
 IT DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE PHASES OF THE MOON.
 NOPE, YOU CAN ACTUALLY TELL DONENESS BY FEELING THE MEAT,
 OR YOU CAN TAKE ITS TEMPERATURE.
 MY, WHAT A BIG PROBE YOU HAVE!
 HEY, GOOD FOR STEAK? NO, THIS IS A CANDY THERMOMETER.
 OKAY, HOW ABOUT THIS LITTLE GUY?
 THAT'S A CAPPUCCINO FROTHER THERMOMETER,
 SO YOU DON'T BURN THE MILK IN YOUR CAPPUCCINO. YOU'RE JOKING.
 NO, I'M NOT. HOW HAVE I LIVED WITHOUT THAT ALL THIS TIME?
 OKAY, I GIVE. I'D RECOMMEND THE INSTANT-READ THERMOMETER.
 OKAY. IT HAS A NICE SKINNY PROBE,
 SO YOU DON'T LEAK THE JUICES OUT OF YOUR MEAT.
 IT HAS AN ON/OFF SWITCH,
 AND IT HAS A DIGITAL READOUT THAT GIVES YOU
 A QUICK AND ACCURATE TEMPERATURE READING.
 AND A FREE BATTERY. COMES WITH A FREE BATTERY TOO.
 HEY, HOW DO YOU LIKE YOUR STEAK? MEDIUM RARE.
 SAUCE? NO, I DON'T CARE FOR SAUCE.
 A PURIST.
 SO FOUR MINUTES IS UP AND OUR STEAK IS DONE,
 AND IT LOOKS REALLY GREAT.
 NOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S SO TERRIFIC
 ABOUT USING AN INSTANT- READ THERMOMETER
 IS YOU CAN LITERALLY TEACH YOURSELF DONENESS,
 LEARN WHAT TO LOOK FOR.
 SO WHENEVER I USE THIS THING,
 I LIKE TO GO INTO THE SIDE OF THE MEAT,
 BECAUSE I'M REALLY INTERESTED IN THE TEMPERATURE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE.
 OKAY, 137 DEGREES--THAT'S GREAT, PRETTY MUCH MEDIUM RARE.
 ♪
 SO WHEN YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT THE TEMPERATURE WHERE YOU WANT IT,
 TAKE A MINUTE AND LOOK AT THE STEAK.
 FEEL IT.
 NOW SEE, THERE IS SOME RESILIENCE THERE,
 BUT IT'S STILL REALLY SOFT... THAT'S MEDIUM RARE.
 NOW ONCE YOU LEARN WHAT YOU'RE AFTER,
 YOU CAN SAVE THIS THING FOR LEG OF LAMB AND ROAST PORK.
 A STEAK OR ANY PIECE OF MEAT IS KIND OF LIKE THIS KETTLE,
 AND WHEN YOU'RE COOKING IT,
 YOU'VE GOT HEAT PUSHING ON THE TISSUES,
 FORCING JUICE INTO THE STEAK.
 NOW IF YOU WERE TO POKE INTO IT OR CUT IT AT THIS POINT,
 THE HEAT WOULD JUST PUSH THE JUICES OUT ONTO THE PLATE,
 AND YOU'D BE LEFT WITH, WELL, A NASTY LITTLE DRIED PIECE OF MEAT
 FLOATING ON A POOL OF JUICE, WHICH ISN'T SO NICE.
 BY RESTING THE MEAT... WELL, IT'S LIKE
 TURNING THE HEAT OFF OF THIS KETTLE,
 ALTHOUGH NOT AS FAST.
 YOU TAKE IT AWAY FROM THE HEAT
 AND GIVE THE PRESSURE OF HEAT TIME TO RECEDE,
 AND THE JUICES REDISTRIBUTE THROUGH THE MEAT.
 WHAT COULD'VE BEEN A PIECE OF LEATHER
 IS NOW A OF JUICY STEAK.
 SINCE WE VIOLATED ITS CELLULAR STRUCTURE
 WITH, OH, SEVERAL HUNDRED DEGREES OF HEAT,
 THERE IS GONNA BE SOME JUICE LOSS.
 WHAT I LIKE TO DO IS TO GET THAT STEAK ELEVATED
 AND OUT OF THOSE JUICES, SO THE BROWN CRUST
 WE'VE BEEN WORKIN' SO HARD TO GET WON'T DISSOLVE.
 I LIKE TO USE A LITTLE PLATE--
 IT CAN BE A SAUCER, WHATEVER--
 AND JUST SCOOT IT RIGHT UP UNDER THE MEAT,
 SO THAT THOSE JUICES DRAIN AWAY.
 NOW THAT STEAK'S SUPPOSED TO REST, NOT FREEZE TO DEATH,
 SO, I LIKE TO TAKE JUST A LITTLE BIT OF ALUMINUM FOIL
 AND LIGHTLY COVER IT.
 NOW BE PATIENT... LEAVE IT ALONE FOR THREE MINUTES,
 AND I PROMISE YOU WILL BE REWARDED.
 ♪
 OKAY, HERE'S A LITTLE HELPFUL CAST IRON HINT--
 AND THIS IS MY FAVORITE FEATURE ABOUT THE PAN--
 YOU NEVER WASH IT.
 JUST WHEN YOU'RE DONE COOKING, PUT A LITTLE FAT IN THE PAN,
 IF THERE ISN'T ANY, ADD ABOUT A TABLESPOON OF KOSHER SALT,
 AND SCRUB IT WITH A WAD OF PAPER TOWELS OR AN OLD RAG.
 WHEN THE PAN'S CLEAN, AND YOU'LL BE ABLE TO TELL
 BECAUSE THE SALT WILL BE FILTHY, JUST DUMP OUT THE SALT
 AND WIPE OUT THE PAN... YOU'RE GOOD TO GO.
 COOL, HUH?
 NOW THIS LOOKS GREAT.
 YOU CAN TELL THAT THIS STEAK RESTED
 BECAUSE THE JUICES ARE IN THE MEAT
 AND NOT ALL OVER THE BOARD AND THE PLATE.
 YOU MIGHT HAVE TO COOK A FEW STEAKS BEFORE YOU NAIL YOUR TECHNIQUE,
 BUT THAT'S WHAT'S SO GREAT ABOUT THIS KIND OF COOKING.
 BECAUSE WHEN YOU START PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT YOU'RE DOING,
 YOU START LEARNING ABOUT THE FOOD,
 AND THAT'S A LOT MORE VALUABLE THAN THE ANY RECIPE.
 THINK OF IT AS AN EXPERIMENT YOU CAN EAT.
 WE'VE PROVEN THAT THERE'S NO GREAT MYSTERY TO A GOOD STEAK.
 YOU USE GOOD MEAT.
 YOU USE A HEAVY PAN OVER HIGH HEAT.
 YOU FINISH IT IN THE OVEN, AND YOU DON'T MOVE IT AROUND.
 NOW I KNOW WHAT SOME OF YOU ARE THINKING...
 HOW IS HE GONNA EAT THAT RED MEAT?
 HOW CAN HE PUT THAT POISON IN HIS BODY?
 WELL, WHY DON'T YOU ASK MY DINNER GUEST, A DIETICIAN.
 SO CAROLINE, HOW ARE YOU GONNA PUT THAT IN YOUR BODY?
 WELL, CONSIDERING IT'S FULL OF VITAMINS,
 IRON, B-12, PROTEIN--NO PROBLEM.
 WELL, THERE YOU HAVE IT.
 JOIN US NEXT TIME FOR MORE "GOOD EATS."
 DON'T FORGET TO BRING YOUR BRAIN AND YOUR APPETITE,
 AND IN THE MEANTIME, PLAY WITH YOUR FOOD.
 HOW'S THE STEAK? GREAT.
 GREAT.
 I DON'T DO THIS EVERY DAY,
 BUT THREE TIMES A WEEK'S NOT BAD.
