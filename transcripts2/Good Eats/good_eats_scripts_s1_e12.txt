 EACH DAY, ABOUT TWO-THIRDS OF THE PEOPLE ON THIS PLANET FUEL UP ON RICE. AND WHY NOT? IT'S NUTRITIOUS, VERSATILE, DELICIOUS, ECONOMICAL. IT'S EVEN HYPOALLERGENIC. YET STILL, THERE ARE A LOT OF AMERICANS WHO DON'T KNOW PILAF FROM PAELLA, ANYMORE THAN THEY CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TEXMATI AND ARBORIO. IN SHORT, RICE IS STILL A LITTLE BIT MYSTERIOUS, AND SINCE WE ARE DOGGEDLY DETERMINED

 TO DECIPHER ALL CULINARY CONUNDRUMS, WE HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO FLING OURSELVES IN THIS TINY, VULNERABLE, WOEFULLY UNDERPOWERED AIRCRAFT INTO THE HEART OF CAJUN COUNTRY. THAT'S RIGHT, WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUR ANSWERS AT THE INTERNATIONAL RICE FESTIVAL IN CROWLEY, LOUISIANA. OH, AND BY THE WAY, THIS IS DEFINITELY "GOOD EATS." ♪ HALF AND HOUR WEST OF LAFAYETTE SITS CROWLEY, LOUISIANA, RICE CAPITAL OF THE WORLD. ONCE WE HAVE OBTAINED LODGING, IT WAS TIME TO CRACK THE RICE MYSTERY. SO WE STARTED AT GROUND ZERO. WE'RE NOT SURE WHEN RICE WAS FIRST CULTIVATED,

 BUT WE'RE PRETTY SURE THAT IT HAPPENED AROUND THE KARRAT REGION OF NORTHERN THAILAND, ABOUT 5000 B.C. WE KNOW THAT THE CHINESE WERE CULTIVATING RICE BY 2800 B.C., BECAUSE WE'VE GOT WRITTEN RECORDS OF IT. BY THE FOURTH CENTURY B.C., THE INDIANS WERE ACTUALLY SHIPPING RICE TO GREECE. FROM THERE, IT WAS JUST A HOP, SKIP AND A JUMP TO PERSIA, OVER THE NILE RIVER DELTA, INTO AFRICA, WHERE RICE JUST LOVED THE SAVANNAH WETLANDS, AND RICE WENT REALLY WELL WITH THE GUMBOS THERE. NOW AMERICAN COLONISTS WOULDN'T TASTE RICE UNTIL ABOUT 1625, WHEN LUCK WOULD HAVE IT, A STORM-BEATEN GALLEON, BOUND FOR MADAGASCAR, LIMPED INTO CHARLESTON HARBOR. NOW A LOCAL PLANTER LENT ASSISTANCE AND WAS REWARDED BY THE CAPTAIN WITH A SMALL BAG OF GOLDEN SEEDS. NOW ODDS ARE HE WOULD'VE RATHER HAD THE GOLD, BUT THINGS WORKED OUT PRETTY WELL FOR HIM. SEE, THE CAROLINA LOWLANDS WERE THE PERFECT PLACE TO GROW RICE. BUT THE MUD WAS SO SOFT, THE MACHINERY, EVEN OXEN, JUST SANK INTO IT. SO IT HAD TO BE WORKED BY HAND, HENCE... SLAVERY. IT WAS RICE, NOT COTTON, THAT BEGAN THE PLANTATION ERA IN THE SOUTH. NOT ONLY COULD THE AFRICAN SLAVES DO THE WORK, THEY HAD THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE RICE FROM THEIR HOMELAND. BY THE EARLY 1800s, CHARLESTON WAS SHIPPING OUT SOME 50,000 TONS OF CAROLINA GOLD RICE PER YEAR, AND IT WAS CONSIDERED TO BE SOME OF THE FINEST RICE IN THE WORLD. WELL, THE END OF THE CIVIL WAR BROUGHT THE END OF SLAVERY, AND IT ENDED THE RICE CULTIVATION IN THE CAROLINAS. BUT BY THEN, SOMEBODY HAD ALREADY FIGURED OUT THAT THE LOW RIVER AREAS AROUND LOUISIANA, EAST TEXAS AND ARKANSAS NOT ONLY COULD SUPPORT RICE, BUT THE HEAVY MACHINERY NEEDED TO CULTIVATE IT IN MODERN TIMES. SO TODAY, MOST OF AMERICA'S RICE IS CULTIVATED IN STATES LIKE ARKANSAS, MISSISSIPPI, MISSOURI, TEXAS, LOUISIANA AND CALIFORNIA. THE FOLKS AT THE MILL GAVE ME THE GRAND TOUR... SHOWED ME HOW THE HUSK IS REMOVED TO MAKE BROWN RICE, AND HOW THE BRAN IS REMOVED TO MAKE WHITE RICE. THEY EVEN SHOWED ME THE LASER THAT SORTS OUT THE BROKEN BITS. THEN I WENT OVER AND CHECKED OUT THE RICE COOKING COMPETITION, THE RICE EATING COMPETITION, AND EVEN THE RICE THRESHING COMPETITION. BUT I STILL HADN'T FOUND WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR. WHY IS RICE LIGHT AND FLUFFY ONE DAY, AND A SOLID BLOCK OF GOO THE NEXT? FINALLY, A LONG-TIME RICE COOKER BROKE THE SILENCE. A RICE COOKER! IMAGINE MY SURPRISE. THE SELF-APPOINTED RICE CAPITAL OF AMERICA, CROWLEY'S BEEN THROWING THIS LITTLE OCTOBER HARVEST PARTY FOR, I DON'T KNOW, 60 YEARS. DURING THE DAYTIME, IT'S ALL RICE-- GROWING RICE, THRESHING RICE, COOKING RICE, AND A LOT OF EATING RICE. BUT COME NIGHTTIME, IT'S JUST A BIG PARTY. COMPLICATED MACHINERY AND SECRET METHODOLOGIES ASIDE, THERE'S JUST NO SUBSTITUTE FOR KNOWING YOUR INGREDIENTS. THERE ARE LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF VARIETIES OF RICE. FROM THE FOOTHILLS OF THE HIMALAYAS COME THE LONG, LIGHTLY PERFUMED BASMATI GRAINS, TAR BABY-LIKE STICKY RICES FROM THE PADDIES OF JAPAN, THE AMAZING SELF-SAUCING ARBORIO RICES FROM NORTHERN ITALY. THAILAND'S JASMINE OFFERS ITS HEADY PERFUME AT A FRACTION OF BASMATI'S PRICE. AND NOW APPEARING IN A PAELLA NEAR YOU, SPAIN'S VALENCIA. WE HAVE WEHANI TEXMATI, DELLA, BLUE, RED, BLACK JAPONICA, WILD RICE--WHICH ISN'T EVEN REALLY RICE TO BEGIN WITH... IT'S AN AQUATIC GRASS-- AND EVEN WHITE RICE. WHEN IT COMES TO RICE COOKING, THERE ARE ONLY TWO QUESTIONS YOU GOTTA ASK... FIRST, WHAT'S THE GRAIN LENGTH? AND SECOND, HOW IS IT PROCESSED? EACH OF THE 10,000-PLUS DIFFERENT VARIETIES OF RICE FALL WITHIN 3 COMMERCIAL CLASSIFICATIONS-- LONG GRAIN, MEDIUM GRAIN, AND-- YOU GUESSED IT--SHORT GRAIN. SHORT-GRAIN RICES ARE GROWN MOSTLY IN ASIA AND CALIFORNIA, AND WHEN COOKED, THESE STUBBY LITTLE GUYS ARE STICKY ENOUGH TO BE FORMED INTO SUSHI, OR PICKED UP EASILY WITH CHOPSTICKS. IN A STRANGE, DOUBLE MALAPROPIAN TWIST, SHORT-GRAIN RICES ARE OFTEN CALLED SWEET OR GLUTINOUS RICES, DESPITE THE FACT THAT THEY DON'T TASTE SWEET AT ALL, AND THEY CONTAIN NO GLUTEN WHATSOEVER. THE STARCH COAT ON MEDIUM-GRAIN RICES, LIKE ITALY'S FAMED ARBORIO, CAN BE COAXED RIGHT OFF OF THE GRAIN, PRODUCING THE CHARACTERISTIC CREAMINESS OF RISOTTO AND RICE PUDDING. ALTHOUGH FLUFFY WHEN FIRST COOKED, MEDIUM-GRAIN RICES GET STICKY AS THEY COOL DOWN. BUT SINCE THEIR STARCH DOESN'T CRYSTALLIZE, THEY'RE A GOOD CHOICE FOR SALADS AND COLD DISHES. AT FOUR TO SIX TIMES LONGER THAN THEY ARE WIDE, LONG-GRAIN RICES DON'T RELEASE STARCH INTO THEIR SURROUNDINGS THE WAY MEDIUM- OR SHORT- GRAIN RICES DO. SO WHAT DO YOU GET? BEAUTIFUL, FLUFFY, INDIVIDUAL, RELATIVELY DRY GRAINS... IN OTHER WORDS, AMERICAN RICE. NOW LONG-GRAIN RICES ARE GREAT ALL-PURPOSES RICES, EXCEPT WHEN IT COMES TO COLD DISHES. SEE, THE STARCH IN THESE GRAINS CRYSTALLIZES WHEN COOKED AND COOLED, WHICH RESULTS IN ROCK-HARD LITTLE GRAINS. WHEN REHEATED, THOUGH, THE CRYSTALS DO DISSOLVE AGAIN. SO WHAT IS BAD FOR, SAY, SALAD IS GOOD FOR FRIED RICE. ♪ ONCE IT'S THRESHED OFF THE EAR, EACH GRAIN IS STILL ENCASED IN A HUSK. REMOVE THE HUSK, AND VOILà, BROWN RICE. SEE, LIKE MOST GRAINS, THE INNER PART OF THE KERNEL, OR ENDOSPERM, IS SURROUNDED BY A THIN LAYER OF BRAN, WHICH IS WHERE MOST OF THE NUTRIENTS ARE. SINCE IT'S A TOUGH LITTLE CUSS, BROWN RICE NEEDS ABOUT THREE TIMES AS MUCH WATER AND TIME TO COOK, AS THE SAME AMOUNT OF WHITE RICE. THE HASSLE'S WORTH IT THOUGH, BECAUSE BROWN RICE HAS A GREAT NUTTY FLAVOR AND A STRONGER NUTRITIONAL PUNCH THAN ITS BUFFED-UP BROTHER. IT CAN BE SOLD AS IS, OR THE BRAN CAN BE RUBBED OFF TO REVEL THE PEARLY WHITE UNDERNEATH. WHITE AND CONVERTED RICE WILL KEEP FOR YEARS ON THE SHELF AS LONG AS YOU KEEP THEM IN AIR-TIGHT CONTAINERS WITH LIDS. I LIKE THESE KIND OF BIG-MOUTH JOBBIES... EASY SCOOPING. NOW BROWN RICE, ON THE OTHER HAND, IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT MATTER, BECAUSE REMEMBER, IT'S STILL GOT THE BRAN ON IT, AND BRAN MEANS OIL. AND OIL WILL GO RANCID IN JUST SIX MONTHS ON THE SHELF. THE ANSWER IS THE FREEZER. IN HERE YOU CAN KEEP IT FOR ONE TO TWO YEARS. BUT SINCE FATS OXIDIZE AND PICK UP OFF FLAVORS, THE THING TO DO IS TO KEEP IT INSIDE A ZIPLOC BAG AND THEN KEEP THAT INSIDE ANOTHER SEALED CONTAINER. SPOILAGE FOILED AGAIN. ♪ DANG! BEFORE SETTLING ON A COOKING METHOD, I THOUGHT I'D BETTER CHECK OUT THE RICE-COOKER SCENE WITH MY EQUIPMENT SPECIALIST, "W." I THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T GOING TO COME AROUND SO OFTEN. HELLO, "W." I NEED EVERYTHING YOU'VE GOT ON RICE COOKERS. COME ON. THE EVER HELPFUL "W" STRUTTED HER WARES. THE COOKERS RANGED FROM SIMPLE HEATED POTS, OR BUCKETS, EVEN, TO A FUZZY-LOGIC MODEL THAT NOT ONLY COOKED RICE TO PERFECTION BUT SCARED THE HECK OUT OF THE DOGS WHILE DELIVERING IT. MYSTERIOUSLY, ALL THESE MACHINES SEEMED TO GRASP SOME PIECE OF KNOWLEDGE THAT HAD ELUDED ME. (robot) THANK YOU, MASTER. RICE COOKERS WORK SO WELL BECAUSE THEY KNOW SOMETHING YOU CAN'T. THE KERNEL'S SECRET ELEVEN HERBS AND SPICES. NO. NO. THE TEMPERATURE INSIDE THE POT. YEAH? WHEN ALL THE WATER'S BEEN ABSORBED BY THE RICE, THE TEMPERATURE BEGINS TO INCREASE. SENSORS THEN BEGIN TO PICK UP ON THE CHANGE, TELL THE MACHINE TO LET THE RICE REST, AND KEEP IT WARM UNTIL SERVICE. WOW, SENSORS! I'LL TAKE IT. NOT THIS ONE. WE'RE GOING TO KEEP IT SIMPLE, FOR YOU. HUH. (Alton) WE GAVE A FEW OF THE MODELS A SPIN. AND SEVERAL DID AN EXCELLENT JOB, ESPECIALLY WITH BROWN RICE, TRADITIONALLY TRICKY BECAUSE OF ITS LONGER COOKING TIME. MANY MODELS DOUBLED AS STEAMERS TOO. WE EVEN MADE SOME PRETTY DECENT JAMBALAYAS. SO IF YOU COOK RICE A LOT, DON'T MIND SPENDING 50 TO 100 BUCKS OR MORE, AND HAVE COUNTER OR CABINET SPACE TO SPARE, YOU HAVE OUR BLESSING. NOW THE MICROWAVE COOKER WE TESTED DIDN'T SAVE ANY TIME, BUT IT PERFORMED CONSISTENTLY AND FREED UP VALUABLE STOVE AND OVEN SPACE. THE PROBLEM IS... YOU CAN'T MAKE RISOTTO IN A RICE COOKER, AND WHAT'S WORSE, YOU CAN'T MAKE PILAF. SEEMS THE WORD PILAF IS FROM THE PERSIAN, PILAU... MEANS RICE DISH. WELL, THERE'S A LITTLE MORE TO IT THAN THAT. A PILAF ALWAYS STARTS WITH LONG-GRAIN RICE, AND IT'S ALWAYS SAUTéED IN A BIT OF FAT, USUALLY BUTTER, BEFORE ANY LIQUID IS ADDED TO THE PAN. NOW LIKE MOST OF OUR FAVORITE DISHES, PILAFS MAKE EXCELLENT FREEZER, FRIDGE AND PANTRY VELCRO. TODAY'S PILAF WILL FEATURE THINGS WE'VE JUST SCARED UP FROM AROUND THE KITCHEN. WE'VE GOT SOME GREEN PEAS-- FROZEN'S FINE, BUT WE'LL THAW THEM... AND THERE MIGHT BE ONE MORE INGREDIENT, BUT IT'S A SECRET... KIND OF A PERSONAL THING. EXCUSE ME. SAFFRON. I'M JUST GOING TO GET HOLD OF A FEW OF THESE PRECIOUS LITTLE STRANDS, AND BLOOM THEM IN HOT WATER. MORE ON THIS LATER. ONE OF THE TWO SECRETS TO RICE COOKERY IS HEAT MANAGEMENT. NOW SINCE THIS IS ONE OF THE FEW HEATED ENVIRONMENTS WE CAN REALLY CONTROL AND TRUST, IT'S MY FAVORITE PLACE FOR COOKING PILAF. WE'LL START OVER ON THE COOKTOP, BUT FINISH IN HERE AT 350 . OKAY, LET'S LIGHT THIS CANDLE. TWO TABLESPOONS OF BUTTER MELTED OVER WHATEVER MEDIUM HAPPENS TO BE ON YOUR RANGE. NOW I LIKE A PAN THAT'S WIDER THAN IT IS TALL, BUT YOU CAN USE ANY HEAVY SAUCEPAN, AS LONG AS ITS GOT A TIGHT-FITTING LID. NOW WHEN THE BUTTER MELTS, ADD YOUR ONION AND YOUR BELL PEPPER, ALONG WITH A COUPLE OF PINCHES OF KOSHER SALT. STIR TO COAT, THEN TURN DOWN THE HEAT. WE WANT THIS TO SWEAT, NOT TO BROWN OR SAUTé. YOU WANT TO COOK IT SLOWLY, UNTIL THE AROMATICS BECOME SOFT AND FRAGRANT. NOW THESE INGREDIENTS DO NOT A PILAF MAKE. PILAF IS A METHOD. EVEN IF NOTHING ENDED UP IN THIS PAN BUT RICE, A LITTLE FAT, AND WATER, IT WOULD STILL BE A PILAF. NOW THE SECOND SECRET TO HAPPY RICE IS FINDING THE RIGHT RATIO OF RICE TO LIQUID. THE INSTRUCTIONS ON YOUR AVERAGE BAG OF RICE ALWAYS SAYS THE SAME THING-- ONE CUP RICE, TWO CUPS WATER. IF THAT WERE RIGHT, AND I DON'T THINK IT IS, ONE COULD DEDUCE THAT A TWO- TO-ONE WATER/RICE RATIO WOULD ALWAYS BE THE WAY TO GO, NO MATTER HOW MUCH RICE WAS INVOLVED. WELL, IT ISN'T THAT WAY. NOT ONLY ARE TWO CUPS OF WATER MORE THAN ANY RESPECTABLE CUP OF LONG-GRAIN RICE NEEDS, BUT THE PROPORTION OF WATER TO RICE ACTUALLY GOES DOWN THE MORE RICE YOU COOK. HERE'S HOW WE SEE IT. NOW FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT, WE WILL RESTRICT OUR DEMONSTRATION TO AMERICAN LONG- GRAIN WHITE RICE. ONE CUP OF RICE WILL COOK VERY NICELY, THANK YOU, IN ONE AND A HALF CUPS OF WATER. SEEMS PRETTY SIMPLE, RIGHT? BUT THE PLOT THICKENS. TWO CUPS OF RICE WILL COOK PERFECTLY IN TWO AND THREE-QUARTER CUPS OF WATER. WAIT, IT GETS EVEN WEIRDER. THREE CUPS OF RICE CAN BE COOKED TO PERFECTION IN THREE AND A HALF CUPS OF WATER, WHICH OBVIOUSLY MAKES IT SEEM APPARENT THAT THE MORE RICE YOU COOK, THE LESS WATER YOU NEED. NOW IF YOU HAVE A SLIDE RULE, AND YOU KNOW HOW TO USE IT, YOU COULD PROBABLY FIGURE OUT SOME KIND OF HANDY FORMULA, OR THE VERY LEAST, COME UP WITH A GOOD COMEDY ROUTINE. (goofy voice) HEY, ABBOT, WHEN WE GOING TO HAVE MORE RICE THAN WATER? ♪ OKAY, OUR VEGGIES ARE SOFT AND FRAGRANT, SO IT'S TIME TO ADD THE RICE. I'M GOING WITH TWO CUPS OF AMERICAN LONG-GRAIN POLISHED RICE, NOT CONVERTED. ♪ I'M GOING TO STIR TO COAT AND TURN UP THE HEAT. I WANT THE BUTTER TO GET HOT ENOUGH TO KIND OF CARAMELIZE SOME OF THE SUGARS THAT ARE ON THE OUTSIDE STARCH OF THE RICE KERNEL. THAT'S GOING TO GIVE THE PILAF ITS CHARACTERISTIC NUTTY FLAVOR. HOW LONG TO COOK? WELL, UNTIL YOU SMELL NUTS. EVERY GOOD COOK I KNOW IS CONSTANTLY TASTING AND SMELLING THINGS. WHY TRUST YOUR NOSE? IT GREW WHERE IT IS, SPECIFICALLY TO HELP YOU FIND STUFF TO EAT. SO TAKE A LESSON FROM YOUR DOG AND LISTEN TO YOUR NOSE. (sniff, sniff) I SMELL NUTS. SURE THING--THREE AND A HALF MINUTES. AND OUR RICE HAS TAKEN ON A BEAUTIFUL GOLD COLOR, AND DEFINITELY A NUTTY AROMA. SO WE'RE READY TO ADD THE REST OF THE INGREDIENTS. WE'RE GOING TO START WITH THE LIQUID. WE'VE GOT A TOTAL OF TWO AND THREE-QUARTERS CUP, BECAUSE WE'VE GOT TWO CUPS OF RICE. NOW A QUARTER CUP OF THAT HAS BEEN USED TO STEEP THE SAFFRON, AND YOU CAN TELL THAT IT'S ALREADY LET GO OF A LOT OF ITS GORGEOUS COLOR. IT'S GOING TO PERFUME AND COLOR THE WHOLE BATCH. SO IN IT GOES, ALONG WITH THE REST OF THE STOCK. I'M GOING TO WASH OUT THE SAFFRON BOWL TO GET ALL THAT COLOR OUT. GREAT... GIVE IT A STIR. I'M GOING TO TOSS IN A BAY LEAF... AH... WHAT THE HECK, TWO BAY LEAVES, AND ABOUT A ONE-INCH-WIDE STRIP OF ORANGE ZEST. NOW THE MOST IMPORTANT INGREDIENT-- SALT. RICE, LIKE ANY STARCH, HAS GOT TO BE COOKED WITH SALT, OR IT WON'T MATTER HOW MUCH YOU ADD LATER. IT WILL NEVER TASTE RIGHT. NOW I LIKE TO GET THIS UP TO ABOUT, I DON'T KNOW, SEAWATER FLAVOR. SO I'M GOING TO ADD A TEASPOON AND A HALF OF SALT. GIVE IT A STIR, AND THEN TASTE IT... NOT WITH THE FINGERS THAT I HAD IN THE SALT. GOOD. BRING THE HEAT UP TO HIGH, STIR IT ONCE, AND THEN THROW AWAY THE SPOON. NEVER AGAIN WILL A SPOON... NO, NEVER AGAIN WILL THE SPOON TOUCH THIS RICE. LET IT COME TO A BOIL. I LOVE THAT TIME-FOLDING TRICK. WE HAVE A BOIL. SO IT'S TIME TO TALK ABOUT LIDS. WE NEED A TIGHT COVER THAT WON'T LET STEAM SNEAK OUT OF THE PAN. HERE'S A COOL TRICK. SAY YOU'VE GOT A BOIL, WHICH WE DO, TURN OFF THE HEAT, AND THEN SPREAD A BARELY MOIST DISHTOWEL OVER THE PAN. THEN COVER AND FOLD UP THE EDGES. THIS IS ALSO GOING TO KEEP CONDENSATION FROM DRIPPING OFF THE LID, BACK INTO THE PAN. OKAY, IN THE OVEN. NOW YOU MAY HAVE TO REARRANGE THE RACKS TO GET THE HANDLE IN A BIT. SET YOUR TIMER FOR 15 MINUTES, AND WALK AWAY. NOW I FEEL GOOD ABOUT THE 15 MINUTES, BECAUSE I KNOW MY OVEN'S AT A COZY 350 . HOW DO I KNOW? 'CAUSE I GOT A THERMOMETER IN THERE TO TELL ME SO. NOW RICE-BAG INSTRUCTIONS HAVE TO BE A LITTLE BIT VAGUE FOR COOKING TIMES, BECAUSE THEY CAN'T BE SURE ABOUT YOUR RANGE HEAT ANYMORE THAN THEY CAN MICROWAVE WATTAGE. SO THEY HAVE TO AVERAGE A GUESS. THE FALL-FLOWERING CROCUS IS GROUND ZERO FOR SAFFRON. EACH TINY FLOWER CONTAINS THREE LITTLE THREAD-LIKE STIGMA, WHICH HAVE TO BE PICKED BY HAND. NOW IF YOU PICK THIS PATCH AND ABOUT 43,000 MORE JUST LIKE IT-- THAT'S ABOUT FIVE OF THESE INFIELDS' WORTH-- YOU'D HAVE A POUND OF SAFFRON, WITH A MARKET VALUE OF ABOUT $1,000, MAKING SAFFRON THE MOST EXPENSIVE FOOD ON EARTH. NOW CASHMERE SAFFRON IS THE BEST. IT'S EASILY RECOGNIZED BY ITS SOLID RED THREADS. THE SPANISH AND TURKISH SAFFRON, LIKE THIS, CAN CONTAIN UP TO TEN PERCENT YELLOW STAMENS, SO THEY'RE A WEE BIT LESS INTENSE. PERSONALLY, I DON'T NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE IN FLAVOR AS MUCH AS THE DIFFERENCE IN PRICE, WHICH CAN BE SUBSTANTIAL. NOW LUCKILY, A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY. WE ONLY USED ABOUT A QUARTER'S WORTH FOR OUR PILAF. NOW WE SUGGEST YOU BUY SAFFRON FROM A SPECIALTY SPICE CATALOG, NOT FROM A STORE WHERE IT MAY HAVE BEEN LAYING AROUND LOSING ITS PUNCH. NEVER SETTLE FOR CRUSHED OR POWERED SAFFRON-- IT'S ALMOST ALWAYS BEEN CUT WITH TURMERIC. NOW KEEP YOUR SAFFRON IN A HEAVY PLASTIC BAG OR A JAR WITH AN AIR-TIGHT LID. THE SAFE IS OPTIONAL. (beep beep beep beep) WHAT'S THAT? FIFTEEN MINUTES, ALREADY? FIGHT WITH ALL YOUR MIGHT THE URGE TO OPEN THAT LID FOR AT LEAST TEN MINUTES. FIFTEEN WOULD BE BETTER, TWENTY WOULD BE OKAY. SEE, THERE'S STILL A LOT OF HEAT IN THERE. THAT RICE IS STILL COOKING. YOU OPEN THAT LID NOW, THAT RICE WILL MISS ITS ONE SHOT AT BEING ALL IT COULD BE. AND BELIEVE ME, A GRAIN IS A TERRIBLE THING TO WASTE. AND DON'T WORRY, IF SOMETHING DID GO WRONG IN THERE, ODDS ARE WE CAN FIX IT. OKAY, BREAKTIME'S OVER. YOU CAN LOOK AT YOUR RICE, IF YOU'RE READY WITH A BOWL OR A SERVING PLATTER TO TURN IT OUT INTO. AHH... LOOKS GREAT. BUT DANGER LURKS JUST BELOW THE SURFACE. SEE, THE STARCH IS A LITTLE UNSTABLE. STIRRING COULD TURN THE WHOLE THING INTO A GUMMY MESS. SO TURN IT OUT ONTO A LARGE PLATTER. JUST LET THE GRAINS FALL WHERE THEY WANT TO GO. NOW YOU MAY FLUFF THE RICE. USE A LARGE SERVING FORK OR A PASTA FORK. AND GO AHEAD AND TAKE OUT THE ZEST AND THE BAY LEAF. THEY HAVE GIVEN THEIR ALL. NOW IT'S TIME TO GO WITH THE PEAS. THE RICE IS PLENTY HOT ENOUGH TO WARM IT THROUGH. IF YOU WANT TO GET FANCY, CONSIDER MAYBE GOLDEN RAISINS, OR MY FAVORITE-- CHOPPED PISTACHIOS. THAT IS A FINE-LOOKING PILAF. NOW RICE IS NOT MANUFACTURED. IT'S A NATURAL PRODUCT, AND EVERY GRAIN IS DIFFERENT, EVERY CROP IS DIFFERENT. BECAUSE OF THAT, YOU CAN'T VERY WELL EXPECT EVERY POT OF RICE TO BE THE SAME. WHAT I'M GETTING TO, IS EVEN IF YOU DO EVERYTHING RIGHT, OCCASIONALLY THERE'S GOING TO BE AN ACCIDENT. BUT MOST OF THEM ARE FIXABLE. FOR INSTANCE, IF YOU COOK YOUR RICE, AND IT'S DONE BUT A LITTLE WATERY, JUST DRAIN IT IN A COLANDER, PUT IT BACK ON A SHEET PAN OR A JELLY ROLL PAN. PUT IT IN THE OVEN FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES. IT'LL DRY UP. IF IT'S A LITTLE ON THE UNDERDONE SIDE, JUST DROP, SAY... A CUP-- WELL HALF A CUP EVEN-- OF HOT WATER IN THE PAN. SLAP ON THE LID. WAIT FIVE MINUTES. THE STEAM WILL COOK IT THE REST OF THE WAY. IF, ON THE OTHER HAND, YOUR RICE IS GOOEY AND GUMMY AND MUSHY, WELL, CONSIDER FINDING YOURSELF A GOOD RICE PUDDING RECIPE. OR DO WHAT I DO... FEED IT TO THE DOG. ♪ CONSIDERING ITS HISTORY, VERSATILITY, CULTURAL SIGNIFICANCE, AND THE FACT THAT IT'S CULTIVATED ON EVERY CONTINENT ON EARTH, EXCEPT FOR ONE, YOU MIGHT SAY THAT WE'VE JUST BARELY CRACKED THE BOOK ON RICE. BUT WE HOPE THAT YOU KNOW MORE THAN YOU DID A HALF AN HOUR AGO. JUST REMEMBER... AND CONSIDER THIS FUN FACT... OF ALL THE RICE CULTURES ON EARTH, EVERY ONE OF THEM CONSIDERS RICE TO BE A SYMBOL OF FERTILITY, WHICH IS WHY WE'VE BEEN THROWING THIS AT WEDDINGS FOR THE LAST FEW MILLENNIUM, AND NOT CORNCOBS, SMALL WATERMELONS, OR LIVE FISH. SEE YOU NEXT TIME, ON "GOOD EATS." ♪
