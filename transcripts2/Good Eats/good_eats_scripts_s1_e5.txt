 DO YOU THINK IT'S DONE?
 WHAT DOES IT SAY?
 HMM... ASK AGAIN LATER.
 WELL, ALL RIGHT, THEN.
 OPEN THE POD BAY DOORS, HAL.
 A FAMOUS GASTRONOME ONCE WROTE,
 "WE CAN LEARN TO COOK BUT MUST BE BORN TO ROAST."
 GRANTED, AT THE TIME HE WROTE THAT,
 PEOPLE WERE STILL ROASTING OVER OPEN PITS,
 BUT THERE'S STILL PLENTY OF CONFUSION TO GO AROUND TODAY.
 JUST ASK THE OWNERS OF THIS PALLID POULTRY.
 SIMPLE ROAST CHICKEN
 DOESN'T ALWAYS TRANSLATE TO EASY ROAST CHICKEN.
 WELL, IN THE NEXT HALF-HOUR, WE'RE GOING TO EXPLORE
 THIS HALLOWED HOLLOW WE CALL THE OVEN.
 WE'LL PICK THE RIGHT PAN TO PUT IN IT
 AND THE RIGHT CHICKEN TO PUT IN THE PAN.
 AND IN THE END, WE WILL EMERGE WITH A BEAUTIFUL,
 JUICY, FLAVORFUL BIRD
 IN LESS THAN HALF AN HOUR.
 NOW THAT'S "GOOD EATS..."
 BUT THEN, SO IS THIS.
 STICK AROUND.
 ♪
 A TWO-TON "I CHOMP WITH AN ATTITUDE,"
 ALBERTASAURUS HERE WAS ONE LARGE-LIVIN' THEROPOD.
 LIKE MANY OF HIS PREHISTORIC PALS, HE DID AS HE PLEASED.
 HE HUNG OUT WITH FRIENDS, ATE WHATEVER HE COULD GET HIS JAWS AROUND--
 WHICH WAS A LOT--
 AND MADE LITTLE DINOSAURS.
 BUT NOW SOME NEW PALEONTOLOGICAL MUSING SUGGESTS
 THAT BIG AL AND HIS FRIENDS DIDN'T REALLY BECOME EXTINCT AT ALL.
 THEY JUST UNDERWENT A LONG TERM DOWNSIZING,
 THE ULTIMATE RESULT OF WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN GALLUS DOMESTICUS.
 A RELATIVE NEWCOMER ON THE ANIMAL-KINGDOM BLOCK,
 THE CHICKEN, AS WE KNOW IT,
 IS ONLY ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE THOUSAND YEARS OLD.
 AND YET HE SHARES MANY OF BIG AL'S INTERESTS...
 HANGIN' OUT WITH FRIENDS, EATING ANYTHING HE CAN GET HIS BEAK AROUND,
 AND MAKIN' LITTLE CHICKENS.
 ONCE UPON A TIME, CHICKENS STRUTTED AROUND FAMILY FARMS...
 A LOT LIKE THIS ONE.
 JUST ABOUT EVERYONE WHO DIDN'T LIVE IN THE CITY
 KEPT A CHICKEN OR TWO.
 NOW THESE WERE SLOW-GROWING BUT FLAVORFUL BIRDS,
 VALUED MORE FOR THEIR EGGS, REALLY, THAN FOR THEIR MEAT.
 OF COURSE, IN THE END, EVERY CHICKEN MET HIS POT.
 AFTER WORLD WAR II, FARMS CONSOLIDATED
 INTO VERTICALLY INTEGRATED CONGLOMERATES,
 AND THE FATE OF THE CHICKEN PASSED FROM FOLKS IN OVERALLS
 TO GUYS IN LAB COATS.
 THE RESULT, AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE COVER
 OF THIS FINE SCIENTIFIC JOURNAL,
 TODAY'S CORPORATE BIRD GROWS TWICE AS BIG, TWICE AS FAST,
 AND AT A ABOUT HALF THE COST OF THE BIRD OF YESTERYEAR,
 MAKING IT FROM EGG TO PLATE IN WEEKS, RATHER THAN MONTHS.
 COURSE, THERE ARE POULTRY PURISTS WHO WOULD ARGUE
 THAT IF TODAY'S UBER CHICKEN
 REALLY TASTED LIKE CHICKEN,
 THEN THE EXPRESSION "TASTES LIKE CHICKEN" WOULDN'T EXIST,
 BECAUSE NOTHING WOULD TASTE LIKE CHICKEN
 EXCEPT, OF COURSE, CHICKEN.
 NOW WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO SORT THIS ALL OUT
 IS A POULTRY SCIENTIST.
 HI, MIKE. HI, ALTON.
 SO DOES TODAY'S CHICKEN TASTE DIFFERENT
 FROM, SAY, A CHICKEN 50 YEARS AGO?
 WELL, MY GRANDMOTHER TELLS ME THAT IT DOES,
 SO I CERTAINLY WOULDN'T ARGUE WITH HER.
 TODAY'S CHICKEN IS OBVIOUSLY MEATIER,
 JUICIER, MORE TENDER,
 MORE CONSISTENT THAN IN THE PAST.
 SO SOME OF THE WORDS WE HEAR A LOT
 IN CHICKEN TALK THESE DAYS--
 STEROIDS, GROWTH HORMONES, ANTIBIOTICS...
 THERE ARE NO STEROIDS OR HORMONES
 GIVEN TO CHICKENS IN THE UNITED STATES.
 THAT'S AGAINST THE LAW, AND BESIDES THAT
 THE CHICKENS ARE PRETTY MUCH GROWING AS FAST AS THEY CAN
 AND HORMONES REALLY AREN'T EFFECTIVE.
 ORGANIC AND FREE-RANGE, DO THEY REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE?
 FREE-RANGE BIRDS DO TEND TO BE A LITTLE BIT OLDER,
 SO THE MEAT MAY HAVE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT TEXTURE,
 MAYBE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT FLAVOR.
 BIRDS THAT ARE GROWN ON COMMERCIAL FARMS
 HAVE ROOM TO WALK AROUND.
 THEY ARE ESSENTIALLY FREE-RANGING,
 EXCEPT THAT THEY'RE GROWN INSIDE OF BUILDINGS,
 INSTEAD OF OUT IN PASTURES.
 MIKE, THANKS FOR YOUR TIME, I KNOW YOU GOT TO GET BACK TO THE FARM.
 YOU GUYS WOULDN'T HAPPEN TO RAISE ANY... NO.
 ♪
 AT MOST MODERN MARKETS THESE DAYS,
 BESIDES THE NATIONAL BRANDS, YOU'LL ALSO PROBABLY SEE
 A FREE-RANGE BIRD OR TWO,
 AS WELL AS MAYBE A KOSHER BIRD,
 THAT'S BEEN SOAKED IN A SALT BRINE.
 NOW MOST ORGANIC AND KOSHER BIRDS
 ARE GONNA LOOK A LITTLE PALE,
 COMPARED TO, SAY, THE NATIONAL BRANDS.
 SEE, SKIN COLOR IS DETERMINED BY DIET.
 NOW SOME MARKETING RESEARCH GURU SOMEPLACE DECIDED
 THAT US CONSUMERS LIKE OUR CHICKENS YELLOW.
 SO A LOT OF GROWERS ADD THINGS LIKE MARIGOLD PETALS
 RIGHT TO THE FEED... HENCE, YELLOW SKIN.
 IT DOESN'T HURT ANYTHING, BUT IT DOESN'T EXACTLY
 ADD ANY FLAVOR, EITHER.
 NOW WHEN IT COMES TO SIZE,
 I REALLY LIKE BROILER/FRYERS.
 THAT'S A BIRD IN THE THREE-AND- A-HALF TO FOUR-POUND RANGE.
 NOW MOST FREE-RANGE BIRDS HIT THAT MARK,
 AND THEY YIELD JUST ENOUGH FOR FOUR ADULTS TO HAVE DINNER.
 IF YOU HAVE MORE GUESTS, LOOK FOR A ROASTER,
 WHICH IS IN THE FOUR- TO FIVE-POUND RANGE.
 AND FOR NOW, STEER CLEAR OF STEWING HENS.
 THEY'RE TASTY, BUT THEY REQUIRE MOIST, NOT DRY, COOKING,
 SO ROASTING IS OUT.
 AS YOU CAN SEE, I'VE MADE SOME, WELL,
 MODIFICATIONS TO MY REFRIGERATOR.
 SAY HELLO TO DR. PENNY ADCOCK
 OF THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL.
 WHAT'S UP, DOC?
 OH, IT'S ABOUT 34 DEGREES, HUMIDITY 75 PERCENT AND HOLDING,
 PERFECT TEMPERATURE FOR A HOME REFRIGERATOR.
 UH, GOT SOME RAW CHICKEN FOR YA.
 WELL, YOU CAN START BY PUTTING IT IN A BOWL OR A TRAY
 AND PUTTING IT ON THE BOTTOM SHELF.
 ANYTHING ELSE? WELL, YOU ALWAYS WANT TO COOK OR FREEZE RAW POULTRY
 NO LATER THAN THE USE- BY DATE ON THE PACKAGE.
 AND YOU SHOULD NEVER REFREEZE RAW POULTRY
 AFTER YOU'VE ALREADY THAWED IT.
 ALWAYS COOK TO AN INTERNAL TEMPERATURE
 OF AT LEAST 170 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT TO KILL THE BACTERIA.
 WON'T SEVEN MINUTES AT 140 DO THE SAME THING?
 SURE, THAT'LL DO THE SAME THING,
 BUT CHICKEN COOKED TO 140 DEGREES JUST TASTES NASTY.
 WELL PUT.
 SO WHY IS POULTRY SO SUSCEPTIBLE TO BACTERIA?
 WELL, CHICKEN IS LESS ACIDIC THAN RED MEAT,
 AND THAT HIGH pH PROVIDES THE PERFECT ENVIRONMENT
 FOR MICROBES TO GROW.
 IS UNDERCOOKING THE BIGGEST CULPRIT, OR IS IT...?
 CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YOU BETCHA.
 BY THE WAY, YOU'RE LETTIN' ALL THE COLD AIR OUT OF HERE.
 SORRY.
 HERE NOW, THE TRUTH...
 IF YOU CUT RAW CHICKEN ON THIS CUTTING BOARD,
 WITH THIS KNIFE AND THESE HANDS, ON THIS COUNTER,
 WELL, GUESS WHAT?
 IT WON'T MATTER IF YOU COOK THAT CHICKEN IN THERE
 TO AN INTERNAL TEMPERATURE TO MAKE POMPEII BLUSH.
 IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO WASH EVERYTHING--THE BOARD,
 YOUR HANDS, THE KNIFE, EVERYTHING--WITH HOT SOAPY WATER
 BEFORE YOU TOUCH ANY OTHER FOODSTUFFS IN THIS KITCHEN.
 AND IF YOU DON'T, YOU COULD BE CRUISING FOR A SIX-DAY,
 SEVEN-NIGHT, ALL-EXPENSES-PAID TRIP TO YOUR BATHROOM...
 AND I'M NOT KIDDING.
 NOW AROUND HERE, WE EVEN KEEP A CUTTING BOARD
 SPECIALLY FOR RAW POULTRY.
 NO CONFUSION, NO ACCIDENTS.
 FROM TIME TO TIME, I EVEN LIKE TO WIPE DOWN THE COUNTERS
 WITH WATER THAT'S LACED WITH JUST A LITTLE BIT OF BLEACH.
 COMMERCIAL DISINFECTANTS DO THE SAME TOO,
 AND YA KNOW, THEY'RE A LOT CHEAPER THAN A HOUSE CALL.
 ♪
 YOU WOULD BE EASY TO DISMISS THE ROASTING PAN
 AS MERE OVEN BUCKET,
 BUT YOUR CHICKEN, AS WELL AS FUTURE LASAGNAS, ENCHILADAS,
 SOUPS, STEWS, COBBLERS AND ROASTS,
 WOULD THANK YOU TO THINK AGAIN.
 HELLO, "W."
 HOW'S THIS? THAT IS A BAKING PAN.
 A BAKING PAN.
 YOUR CHICKEN WOULD BE BETTER OFF ROASTING IN A HUBCAP
 OFF YOUR FATHER'S OLDSMOBILE. DAD DRIVES A CADILLAC, ACTUALLY.
 ALL RIGHT...
 THE RIGHT ROASTING PAN EVENLY DISTRIBUTES,
 ABSORBS, AND REFLECTS HEAT
 AND CAN EVEN STRADDLE TWO BURNERS
 FOR QUICK BROWNING AND SAUCE REDUCTION. SAUCE REDUCTION.
 THE SPECIFICATIONS ARE SIMPLE, EVEN FOR YOU, A.B.
 FIRST, HEAVY IS GOOD. HEAVY.
 SECOND, UPRIGHT, STURDY HANDLES ARE GOOD. UPRIGHT.
 YOU CAN HOLD ON TO THESE WITH MITTS.
 THIRD, POLISHED SURFACE IS GOOD. POLISHED.
 IT REFLECTS HEAT AND HOLDS ON TO PAN DRIPPINGS,
 SOMETHING NON-STICK SURFACES CANNOT DO.
 I SEE. I DOUBT THAT.
 THIS PAN IS LARGE ENOUGH FOR A RIB ROAST, BUT NOT TOO BIG FOR LASAGNA,
 HAS FLARED EDGES FOR EASY FOIL CRIMPING--
 IN SHORT, EVERYTHING YOU COULD WANT IN A ROASTING PAN.
 NOT EXACTLY CHEAP.
 THIS IS ONE DEVICE THAT I DO NOT ADVISE YOU SKIMPING ON.
 VERY WELL. A.B., DO NOT RUN AWAY WITH MY MITTS!
 OH, HAVE YOUR OLD MITTS, I DON'T WANT THEM, ANYWAY.
 OKAY, EVERYBODY, REPEAT AFTER ME...
 ORGANIZATION WILL SET ME FREE.
 I DON'T MEAN TO SOUND LIKE A MOTIVATIONAL SPEAKER,
 BUT IT'S TRUE, ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE PLANNING TO BE
 IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH RAW CHICKEN OR MEAT
 OR OTHER POSSIBLE SOURCES OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION.
 GET IN THE HABIT OF PREPPING AND GATHERING
 EVERYTHING YOU NEED BEFORE YOU GET YOUR HANDS IN THE FOOD.
 NOW AROUND HERE WE LIKE TO MEASURE OUR INGREDIENTS
 INTO CUSTARD CUPS, SET THEM ON A TRAY OR SHEET PAN,
 ALONG WITH ANY TOOLS YOU MIGHT NEED.
 NOW THE FRENCH CALL THIS CONCEPT MISE EN PLACE--
 PUT IN ITS PLACE--
 AND NEXT TO A SHARP, EIGHT-INCH CHEF'S KNIFE,
 IT IS YOUR BEST FRIEND.
 NOW THE WAY WE SEE IT, ROAST CHICKEN SHOULD TASTE LIKE,
 WELL, CHICKEN.
 SO WE KEEP THE SEASONINGS SIMPLE...
 SOME LEMON ZEST, SOME GARLIC, OLIVE OIL, PARSLEY,
 A LITTLE SALT AND PEPPER.
 SALT AND PEPPER... I HATE THAT, I MEAN, THERE'S MORE TO PEPPER
 THAN TO PLAYING YIN TO SALT'S YANG,
 OR IS IT YANG TO SALT'S...
 WELL, YOU KNOW.
 ♪
 I AM THE FIRST TO ADMIT,
 I'LL REACH FOR AN ELECTRIC COFFEE GRINDER IN A FLASH
 WHEN IT COMES TO MILLING MOST SPICES.
 BUT WHEN IT COMES TO PEPPERCORNS
 OR PASTES LIKE TAPENADE OR PESTO OR OUR STUFFING TODAY,
 WHICH IS TECHNICALLY A CREMLATA,
 WELL, IT'S JUST NOT RIGHT TO USE ANYTHING BUT A MORTAR AND PESTLE.
 FOR ONE THING, YOU'RE NOT GONNA END UP WITH BIG OL',
 HUNKIN' CHUNKS OF PEPPERCORN FLOATING AROUND IN DUST.
 AND ALSO WITH THE MILL, YOU USUALLY LEAVE THE FLAVORFUL OILS,
 WELL, INSIDE THE WORK BOWL.
 I STARTED WITH ABOUT A TEASPOON AND A HALF OF PEPPERCORNS,
 AND ONCE YOU GET IT DOWN TO JUST A MEDIUM GRIND,
 GO AHEAD AND ADD ABOUT THREE GARLIC CLOVES' WORTH OF GARLIC,
 WITH A LITTLE BIT OF KOSHER SALT.
 AND WORK THAT JUST FOR A FEW SECONDS.
 YOU DON'T WANT TO BEAT THE MOISTURE ALL THE WAY OUT OF THE GARLIC,
 YOU JUST WANT TO LOOSEN IT UP A LITTLE BIT.
 AS SOON AS YOU SEE THE WATER KIND OF RISE OUT OF IT,
 GO AHEAD AND ADD ABOUT A LEMON'S WORTH OF ZEST.
 NOW SAME THING HERE... YOU DON'T WANT TO BEAT IT TO DEATH,
 JUST WORK IT UNTIL YOU START TO SMELL LEMONS.
 AND WHEN YOU DO,
 HIT IT WITH A LITTLE BIT OF PARSLEY--JUST A PINCH.
 WORK FOR ANOTHER COUPLE OF SECONDS,
 AND THEN WE'RE GONNA BRING IT TO A PASTE CONSISTENCY
 WITH JUST TWO, MAYBE THREE TABLESPOONS
 OF EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL.
 AGAIN, WE'RE NOT TRYING TO MAKE SOUP,
 BUT MAKE A PASTE THAT WE CAN WORK WITH UNDER THE CHICKEN SKIN.
 NOW WE MAY HAVE FOUND THE PERFECT PAN,
 BUT A ROAST NEEDS TO SIT UP OUT OF THE PAN,
 OR ELSE IT'LL JUST LAY THERE IN ITS JUICES AND BOIL.
 NOW FOR THAT WE COULD USE A RACK, BUT RACKS ARE...
 WELL, BESIDES BEING CLUMSY, FOOD STICKS TO THEM,
 AND TRUST ME, THESE THINGS ARE HARD TO CLEAN.
 BUT ABOVE ALL, THEY BRING NO FLAVOR WHATSOEVER
 TO THE PAN DRIPPINGS.
 BUT AROMATIC VEGETABLES DO,
 WHICH IS WHY I FLOAT ALL MY CHICKENS ON ONLY THE FINEST...
 OR MAYBE A LITTLE PAST THEIR PRIME,
 CARROTS, CELERY AND ONIONS.
 TIME TO FACE THE BIRD.
 THE SECRET TO ROAST CHICKEN IS SUNBATHING... SUNBATHING!
 NOW WHEN YOU GO TO THE BEACH,
 YOU DON'T CURL UP INTO A LITTLE BALL,
 YOU STRETCH OUT SO THE SUN'S RADIATION CAN BROIL YOU.
 THAT IS WHAT IT IS, YOU KNOW, BROILING.
 WELL, THE SAME HOLDS TRUE FOR A CHICKEN--
 THE FLATTER AND MORE UNIFORM YOU CAN GET IT,
 THE FASTER AND HOTTER YOU CAN COOK IT.
 AND THAT IS WHAT PRODUCES JUICY MEAT AND CRISP, BROWN SKIN.
 SO INSTEAD OF TRUSSING THE BIRD, WE BUTTERFLY.
 FLIP YOUR BIRD BACKSIDE UP, AND WITH A PAIR OF KITCHEN SHEARS--
 NO, NOT REGULAR SCISSORS--
 CUT THE RIBS DOWN ONE SIDE OF THE BACKBONE
 AND THEN ON THE OTHER.
 SAVE THE BACKBONE, IT'LL BE GREAT FOR THE JUS.
 NOW OPEN THE CHICKEN UP LIKE A BOOK,
 AND TAKE OUT THE KEEL BONE
 THAT SEPARATES THE TWO SIDES OF THE BREAST.
 JUST SLICE THROUGH THAT THIN MEMBRANE
 WITH A TIP OF A PARING KNIFE,
 AND THEN CRACK 'EM OPEN,
 REACH IN WITH A FINGER ON EITHER SIDE OF THE BONE,
 AND JUST LEVER IT OUT.
 NOW THE BREAST WILL LAY FLAT.
 TURNING BIRD BACK OVER,
 AND SPREAD HIM OUT LIKE A BUTTERFLY.
 NOW JUST LOOSEN THE SKIN,
 STARTING IN FROM THE NECK.
 JUST WIGGLE YOUR FINGERS IN--IT'LL LIFT RIGHT OFF.
 JUST TRY NOT TO TEAR IT.
 THERE... NOW TO GET TO THE DARK MEAT,
 JUST LIFT THE SKIN AT THE EDGE.
 DON'T WORRY TO MUCH ABOUT GETTING ALL THE WAY DOWN INTO THE LEG,
 THERE'S NOT A LOT TO SEASON THERE, ANYWAY.
 NOW USE A TEASPOON AND DELIVER THE STUFFING
 TO EACH OF THE QUARTERS,
 AND TRY TO SPREAD IT OUT A LITTLE BIT AS YOU GO.
 PERFECT.
 SO WHY SEASON UNDER THE SKIN?
 WELL, TWO REASONS... ONE, SKIN IS DESIGNED
 TO KEEP WHAT'S OUT, OUT AND WHAT'S IN, IN.
 SO IT STANDS TO REASON IF YOU WANT TO FLAVOR THE MEAT,
 YOU GOTTA GET UNDER THE SKIN.
 TWO, THINGS LIKE LEMON ZEST, GARLIC, PEPPER,
 ALL TASTE REALLY BAD WHEN THEY BURN,
 AND BURN THEY WILL, WHEN EXPOSED TO ALL THIS DIRECT HEAT,
 AND THEY GET IN THE WAY OF THE SKIN BROWNING.
 NOW TAKE A MOMENT FOR A QUICK PRE-OVEN RUBDOWN,
 A LITTLE OLIVE OIL...
 A MASSAGE WILL BE RELAXING FOR BOTH BIRD AND COOK, ALIKE.
 AND BESIDES, GETTING THE OIL DOWN INTO ALL THESE NOOKS AND CRANNIES
 WILL MAKE SURE THAT THIS BIRD BROWNS UP NICE.
 BROWN MEANS CRISP, AND CRISP MEANS GOOD.
 SO BEFORE WE GO IN THE PAN,
 WE'RE GONNA PUT JUST A LITTLE BIT OF SALT ON THE FLESH SIDE,
 MAYBE HALF A TEASPOON OR SO,
 AND THEN IN THE PAN,
 BREAST SIDE UP.
 NOW BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING,
 BEFORE YOU TOUCH THE OVEN DOOR,
 THE TIMER, YOUR COFFEE MUG, YOUR DOG,
 WASH THESE NASTY CHICKEN HANDS.
 LOTS OF HOT WATER, LOTS OF SOAP.
 BELIEVE IT OR NOT, NEXT TO CUTTIN' PASTE,
 THIS MAY BE THE MOST VALUABLE THING
 THEY TAUGHT YOU IN NURSERY SCHOOL.
 NOW ABOUT EIGHT INCHES FROM HEAT TO FOOD IS A GOOD DISTANCE
 FOR A CHICKEN THIS SIZE.
 ANY CLOSER THAN THAT AND OUR BIRD'LL END UP LOOKING LIKE
 ONE OF THOSE PICTURES THE STATE TROOPERS
 MADE YOU LOOK AT IN DRIVERS ED CLASS.
 NOW I'D LOVE TO TELL YOU TO TURN THE BIRD IN TEN MINUTES,
 IN FIFTEEN MINUTES, BUT THE TRUTH IS,
 EVERY BROILER IS DIFFERENT, EVERY CHICKEN IS DIFFERENT.
 SO GIVE IT ABOUT TEN MINUTES AND THEN TAKE A LOOK.
 OH, AND SINCE MOST BROILERS TURN OFF
 WHEN THE OVEN GETS TO A CERTAIN TEMPERATURE,
 LEAVE THE DOOR IN THE FIRST OPEN POSITION.
 SO 18 MINUTES HAS GONE BY, IN OUR WORLD AT LEAST,
 AND IT IS TIME TO CHECK THE BIRD.
 NOW WE'VE GOT SOME REALLY NICE COLOR THERE.
 THIS LOOKS GREAT, BUT I'M HAPPY WITH THIS
 SO I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND GIVE IT THE TURN.
 PAPER TOWELS...
 JUST GRAB THE ENDS OF THE LEGS,
 FLIP 'EM OVER, THAT'S IT.
 BACK UNDER THE BROILER FOR ABOUT ANOTHER 10 TO 12 MINUTES.
 LET'S SEE, OH YEAH, THAT'S A GOOD...
 HAS TEN MINUTES GONE BY ALREADY?
 WHOOH, AND I JUST HAD TIME TO GET THIS CRUDITé PLATTER TOGETHER.
 RIGHT!
 TIME TO TEMPT FATE.
 NOW DO THIS A FEW TIMES, AND YOU'LL LEARN EXACTLY
 WHAT DONE LOOKS AND FEELS LIKE.
 NOW SINCE LIGHT AND DARK MEAT COOK A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY,
 I CHECK BOTH.
 SO SHOOT FOR THE THICKEST PART OF THE BREAST,
 ABOUT AN INCH FROM THE WING.
 NOT QUITE 165, BUT THE MEAT FEELS GOOD AND THE JUICES RUN CLEAR.
 I THINK IT'S A GO.
 NOW I'LL CHECK THE MIDDLE OF THE THIGH ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE...
 167, JUICE IS CLEAR...
 THIS BIRD IS COOKED.
 NOW LIKE ANY ROAST, THIS BIRD NEEDS TO REST A FEW MINUTES,
 SO THE JUICES HAVE TIME TO REDISTRIBUTE THROUGH THE MEAT.
 IT'S GONNA LOSE A LITTLE JUICE, SO PUT IT IN A DEEP BOWL
 AND COVER IT LOOSELY WITH FOIL.
 NOW WE'VE JUST GOT TIME FOR THE JUS.
 ♪
 NOW THESE VEGETABLES HAVE SERVED US WELL,
 BUT THEY'RE NOT DONE YET.
 BEFORE WE MAKE OUR JUS, THOUGH,
 WE WANT TO GET SOME OF THE EXTRA FAT OFF OF THE PAN.
 JUST TILT IT UP AND LET EVERYTHING POOL IN THE BOTTOM,
 AND THEN USE EITHER A WIDE SPOON OR A BOWL BASTER,
 WHICH IS MY FAVORITE,
 AND JUST KIND OF SUCK IT RIGHT UP OFF OF THERE.
 BUT WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT THROW THIS AWAY.
 MIXED WITH A LITTLE RED VINEGAR AND MUSTARD,
 IT'LL MAKE A TERRIFIC VINAIGRETTE FOR A SIDE SALAD.
 NOW THE PAN IS STILL REALLY ROCKET HOT,
 SO LET'S GIVE IT A BOOST
 AND GO AHEAD AND CRANK THIS UP OVER TWO BURNERS
 AND GET IT AS HOT AS WE CAN AS FAST AS WE CAN.
 NOW ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS WE'RE GONNA DO
 IS DEGLAZE THE PAN, WHICH IS GONNA LOOSEN UP
 ALL THIS REALLY GREAT STUCK-ON STUFF AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PAN.
 IT'S WHERE THE REAL FLAVOR IS.
 WE'RE GONNA LET THE PAN JUST GET A LITTLE BIT HOTTER,
 THEN WE'RE GONNA HIT IT WITH SOME WINE.
 I LIKE TO USE RED WINE FOR CHICKEN.
 IT'S NOT VERY TRADITIONAL, BUT I LIKE IT.
 WE'RE JUST GONNA ADD ENOUGH WINE TO JUST COVER
 THE BOTTOM OF THE PAN.
 NOW THAT'S GONNA COME TO A BOIL REALLY QUICKLY,
 SO WE'RE JUST GONNA KIND OF SCRAPE AROUND.
 I KIND OF USE ONE OF THE PIECES OF CARROT OR CELERY TO RUB WITH.
 NOW WINE IS GONNA ADD A BRIGHTNESS TO THE SAUCE,
 A KIND OF, I DON'T KNOW, A FRONT-SEAT FLAVOR.
 BUT WE ALSO NEED SOMETHING IN THE BACKGROUND, SOME BODY.
 WE CAN'T GET THAT FROM WINE.
 WHERE WE GET THAT IS FROM STOCK OR BROTH,
 SOMETHING THAT'S GOT SOME MEATINESS TO IT,
 OR EVEN SOME GELATIN, WHICH WOULD THICKEN THE SAUCE
 AND GIVE IT BODY.
 SO I'M GONNA USE SODIUM- FREE CHICKEN BROTH.
 NOW YOU COULD USE REGULAR CHICKEN BROTH,
 BUT BY THE TIME THIS REDUCED, IT WOULD TASTE LIKE THE DEAD SEA--
 A LITTLE TOO SALTY.
 SO I'M JUST GONNA ADD MAYBE A CUP OF BROTH.
 GIVE THIS A GOOD STIR,
 AND LET IT REDUCE.
 BUT NOW IS ALSO A REALLY GOOD TIME
 TO ADD ANY AROMATICS WE'VE GOT AROUND, LIKE HERBS
 OR SOMETHING TO GIVE KIND OF A FINAL PUNCH OF FLAVOR.
 NOW IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT WE'VE GOT SOME OF THE STUFFING LEFT OVER.
 SINCE IT'S ALL AROMATIC-- LEMON, PARSLEY, GARLIC--
 IT'S A PERFECT ADD ON.
 IT'LL ECHO THE FLAVOR THAT WE'VE ALREADY GOT IN THE CHICKEN,
 WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT WE WANT A JUS TO DO.
 NOW I'M GONNA LEAVE THIS ALONE FOR TWO MINUTES
 OR 'TIL IT'S REDUCED BY HALF.
 ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS STRAIN OUT THE VEGETABLES
 AND YOU'VE GOT A GOOD CUP OF INTENSELY FLAVORED JUS.
 IT'S MORE THAN ENOUGH FOR THIS CHICKEN...
 ENOUGH FOR THREE CHICKENS, REALLY.
 NOW CARVING TIME IS WHEN BUTTERFLY BIRD REALLY SHINES.
 WATCH THIS.
 LEG QUARTER--NOTHIN' BUT SKIN.
 NOW SINCE WE'VE TAKEN OUT THE KEEL BONE
 THAT GOES BETWEEN THE TWO BREASTS,
 THEY'RE GONNA SEPARATE LIKE A BREEZE.
 NOW IF YOU WANT TO SERVE QUARTERS, AND I OFTEN DO
 BECAUSE IT'S PRETTY ON A PLATE,
 YOU MIGHT WANT TO MAKE SOME THIN INCISIONS
 RIGHT THROUGH THE BREAST.
 THAT'S GONNA GIVE THE JUS SOMEPLACE TO GO
 BESIDES JUST RUNNING IN THE PLATE.
 ABOUT THREE OR FOUR CUTS WILL DO NICELY.
 THEN JUST RIGHT ONTO THE PLATE.
 AND YOU DON'T NEED MORE THAN ONE SPOONFUL OF THE JUS--
 IT REALLY IS STRONG.
 JUST RIGHT ACROSS THE BIRD LIKE THAT.
 NOW I GOTTA TELL YA, I AM NOT MR. GARNISH.
 IF IT DOESN'T BRING FLAVOR TO THE MEAL,
 I DON'T THINK IT BELONGS ON THE PLATE.
 BUT SINCE WE'VE ALREADY GOT SORT OF A LEMON MOTIF GOING WITH THE ZEST,
 I'LL BREAK DOWN AND GO ONE SINGLE LEMON WHEEL.
 THERE... DINNERTIME!
 THERE... DINNERTIME!
 NOW THIS WHOLE BUTTERFLYING BUSINESS
 WORKS GREAT ON THE GRILL TOO.
 THE PASTE THAT WE RUBBED UNDER THE SKIN
 COULD'VE BEEN CUMIN, ROSEMARY AND CRUSHED OLIVES,
 OR CURRY PASTE OR EVEN HOMEMADE MAYONNAISE.
 IT'S AN EXTREMELY VERSATILE METHOD,
 ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE OF US WHO SOMETIMES
 TAKE THE EXTRA SKIN OFF TO AVOID THE FAT.
 WE HOPE YOU'VE LEARNED A THING OR TWO
 ABOUT THE CULINARY CHAMELEON WE CALL CHICKEN.
 JOIN US NEXT TIME ON "GOOD EATS."
 AND IN THE MEANTIME, DON'T CRY FOUL!
