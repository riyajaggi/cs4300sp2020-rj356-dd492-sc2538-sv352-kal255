 GUESS WHAT HAPPENS? WHAT? THEY ALL STARVE TO DEATH! HA, HA, HA, HA. WHO IS THIS? I'M YOUR NEW INTERN, SIR. WERE! FRUITCAKE... TRADITIONAL, MULTI-ETHNIC, HISTORICAL, HOLIDAY THROUGH AND THROUGH. I LIKE IT. AND IT'S AS EASY AS FALLING OFF A LOG. THE "GOOD EATS" DATABASE SHOWS HUNDREDS OF RECIPES. TECHNIQUES ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE. CLEARLY IT'S TIME TO SET THINGS STRAIGHT... ALL RIGHT. LISTEN UP, PEOPLE... WHAT WE NEED IS A GREAT CAKE THAT STILL MAKES GOOD SENSE. R AND D, I WANT YOU TO GET ON THIS RIGHT AWAY. COME ON, PEOPLE... THESE SHOWS DON'T MAKE THEMSELVES! AH, YOU HUNG UP ON EVERYBODY, BIG SHOT! OH, BOTHER. DARK AND DENSE... LIGHT AND FLUFFY... BRANDY-SOAKED OR ON THE WAGON... ALL FRUITCAKES HAVE THEIR ROOTS IN RELIGIOUS RITUAL. IN ANCIENT EGYPT, FRUIT-LADEN BREADS WERE OFTEN BURIED ALONGSIDE THE DEAD, LIKE POSTMORTEM POWER BARS. THE ANCIENT GREEKS ACTUALLY CALLED THEIR FRUITCAKES FOOD OF THE GODS, WHILE ROMAN RELIGIOUS FESTIVAL CAKES, PACKED WITH POMEGRANATES, RAISINS AND PINE NUTS, EVENTUALLY EVOLVED INTO THE LIGHT-GOLDEN FRUITCAKE WE KNOW TODAY AS PANFORTE. DID YOU KNOW THAT PANFORTE WAS THE FAVORITE TRAIL FOOD OF THE ITALIAN CRUSADERS? THIS I DID NOT KNOW. BUT THEN, I'M NOT A NUTRITIONAL ANTHROPOLOGIST, AM I? NO... YOU'RE NOT, BUT I AM! HEY! OKAY, SO HOW IS IT THAT MEDIEVAL K RATION BECAME YULETIDE TRADITION? WELL, WHAT AMERICANS CALL FRUITCAKE COMES FROM THE OLD ENGLISH PLUM PUDDING. PLUM REFERS TO ANY KIND OF DRIED FRUIT, AND PUDDING IS A WAY OF BOILING OR STEAMING A CAKE AND THEN WRAPPING IT UP IN CLOTH. TELL ME SOMETHING... IS THERE ANYTHING THOSE PEOPLE WON'T BOIL? WELL, ONLY CASTLES HAD OVENS, SO REGULAR PEOPLE HAD TO DO ALL THEIR COOKING IN POTS. SO THEY'D COOK THE CAKE IN A POT, AND THEN THEY'D WRAP IT UP IN A CLOTH THAT WAS SOAKED IN BRANDY OR SOME OTHER WINE. THEN THEY'D PUT IT INTO A TIN, AND THEY'D LET IT RIPEN FOR MONTHS OR EVEN YEARS. LIKE PUTTING DOWN A GOOD BORDEAUX. BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY ALL THE FUSS. WELL, IT WAS A FORM OF PRESERVATION. THEY DIDN'T HAVE FREEZING OR CANNING. AND FRUITS AND NUTS ARE BOTH NUTRITIOUS, BUT THEY SPOIL PRETTY QUICKLY. AND THEY FOUND THAT IF THEY WOULD COOK THEM INTO A CAKE THAT WAS VERY DENSE AND SOAKED WITH ALCOHOL, IT WOULD KEEP THEM FRESH FOR A LONG, LONG TIME... EXCUSE ME... LOOK AT THAT TREE. SO IN OTHER WORDS, FRUITCAKE'S KIND OF A... NUTRITIONAL SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX. EXACTLY. BUT THAT DOESN'T EXPLAIN WHY THERE'S ONE IN MY STOCKING YEAR AFTER YEAR. WELL, KIND OF COMPARE IT TO A CHRISTMAS TREE. WHY DO WE TAKE A TREE AND PUT IT IN OUR LIVING ROOM YEAR AFTER YEAR? IT'S A MATTER OF CULTURAL SIGNIFICANCE. OVER THE YEARS, FRUITCAKES TOOK ON GREAT SYMBOLIC MEANING. THEY CAME TO STAND FOR GOOD LUCK AND FOR FERTILITY. IN FACT, DID YOU KNOW THAT THE TYPICAL ENGLISH WEDDING CAKE IS A FRUITCAKE, SYMBOLIZING FERTILITY? THEY EVEN SAY THAT IF A BRIDESMAID TAKES A PIECE OF WEDDING CAKE, PUTS IT UNDER HER PILLOW, THAT NIGHT SHE WILL DREAM OF HER HUSBAND-TO-BE. VERY ROMANTIC. A LITTLE CRUMBY MAYBE, BUT ROMANTIC. SO HOW DO YOU LIKE YOUR FRUITCAKE? WHEN IT COMES TO FRUITCAKE, DID YOU EVER HEAR ABOUT THE STORY ABOUT THE END OF THE WORLD, AND THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE ANYTHING LEFT BUT RATS AND ROACHES AND FRUITCAKE? I HEARD THAT ONE. AREN'T YOU GONNA HELP ME TAKE MY TREE TO THE CAR? HAVING PONDERED CLOSE TO A HUNDRED RECIPES, WE'VE COME TO SOMETHING OF A REVELATION... A FRUITCAKE IS LIKE A STEREO SYSTEM. YOU CAN PLAY LOOSE AND EASY WITH THE INGREDIENTS, BUT IN THE END THE OVERALL QUALITY WILL NEVER EXCEED THAT OF THE WEAKEST COMPONENT. SO IF YOUR FRUIT, NUTS OR SPICES AREN'T QUALITY, IT WON'T MATTER IF YOU SOAK THE WHOLE CAKE IN CENTURY-OLD RéMY, IT'LL STILL BE A DOORSTOP. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT NEXT TO INSTANT BROWNIES, FRUITCAKE MAY BE THE EASIEST THING YOU'LL EVER BAKE. HEY, GATHERING THE INGREDIENTS IS MOST OF THE WORK, AND THAT'S NO WORK AT ALL. NOW OUR FREE RANGE FRUITCAKE BYPASSES TOOTHACHINGLY SWEET, NUCLEAR GUMMY FRUITS, IN FAVOR OF THE HONEST FLAVORS OF DRIED FRUITS. NOW WE'RE GONNA NEED A CUP OF BOTH GOLDEN RAISINS AND CURRANTS. GOLDEN RAISINS ARE MADE FROM THOMPSON SEEDLESS GRAPES, LIKE REGULAR RAISINS, ONLY THEY'RE NOT LEFT TO DARKEN ON THE VINE. CURRANTS, AS OPPOSED TO THE GOOSEBERRY COUSIN OF THE SAME NAME, ARE ACTUALLY THE DRIED VERSION OF THE TINY ZANTE GRAPE. NOW WE'RE ALSO GOING TO NEED A HALF-CUP OF EACH OF DRIED CRANBERRIES, CHERRIES, BLUEBERRIES AND DRIED APRICOTS. NOW MOST DRIED FRUITS, ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH YELLOW OR ORANGE FLESH, ARE TREATED WITH SULFITES, WHICH STABILIZE THE COLOR AND STAVE OFF MICROBIAL ATTACK. NOW DESPITE THE SCARY NAME, SULFITES ARE CONSIDERED SAFE, SINCE OUR BODIES METABOLIZE THEM AND TOSS THEM OUT WITH THE DISHWATER, IF YOU GET MY DRIFT. BUT SOME FOLKS, ASTHMATICS IN PARTICULAR, CAN SUFFER ALLERGIC REACTIONS TO SULFITES. NOW THE LABELING LAWS IN THIS COUNTRY ARE PRETTY STRICT, SO IF YOU KNOW YOU'RE SULFITE-SENSITIVE, JUST CHECK THE PACKAGE. IT'LL BE THE LAST THING ON THERE. OH, BY THE WAY, THE ONLY CANDY PRESENCE ON OUR RECIPE IS A QUARTER-CUP OF CANDIED GINGER. FRUITCAKES OF YORE INCLUDED ALCOHOL FOR ITS PRESERVATIVE POWERS. NOW OUR CAKE MAY NOT BE HEADED FOR LONG-TERM STORAGE, BUT ALCOHOL STILL HAS SEVERAL ROLES TO PLAY, WHICH IS WHY OUR FOUR CUPS OF DRIED FRUIT-- ALONG WITH 1/4 CUP OF CANDIED GINGER AND THE CHOPPED ZEST OF ONE LEMON AND ONE ORANGE-- WILL BE SPENDING THE NIGHT IN ONE CUP OF GOLD RUM. NOW BESIDES REHYDRATING THE FRUIT, THE RUM WILL LIBERATE ALCOHOL- SOLUBLE FLAVOR COMPOUNDS THAT ARE LOCKED AWAY IN THERE. IF YOU'VE EVER SEEN A TOMATO SAUCE RECIPE WITH VODKA IN IT, SAME PRINCIPLE. NOW IN THE FINISHED CAKE, THE ALCOHOL WILL INTENSIFY FLAVORS BY CARRYING AROMAS FROM THE MOUTH UP TO THE NOSE. DON'T FORGET... SMELL IS HALF OF TASTING. NOW IF OVERNIGHT IS NOT AN OPTION, JUST PUT EVERYTHING IN A MICROWAVE SAFE BOWL AND NUKE IT ON HIGH FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES. THE RESULTS WON'T BE EXACTLY THE SAME, BUT YOU'LL GET CLOSE. TIME TO GO NUTS. A GOOD FRUITCAKE IS AS NUTTY AS... WELL, THERE YOU GO. BUT FUNNILY ENOUGH, MY FAVORITE FRUITCAKE FODDER-- PECANS--AREN'T TRUE NUTS. THEY'RE MEMBERS OF THE HICKORY FAMILY, WHICH MAKES THEM DRUPES, A DRUPE BEING A FLESHY FRUIT CONTAINING A SHELL ENCASED SEED OR COTYLEDON. NOW IN THE CASE OF PECANS, WE WAIT UNTIL THAT FLESHY PART FALLS AWAY, AND THEN WE HARVEST THE SHELL, WHICH WE CRACK OPEN TO GET THE SEED OR COTYLEDON. IN OTHER DRUPES HOWEVER-- MANGOES, PEACHES, CHERRIES-- IT'S THE FLESH WE'RE AFTER. WE THROW THE SEEDS AWAY. AND WHEN IT COMES TO BLACKBERRIES AND RASPBERRIES, WHICH ARE JUST LITTLE, KIND OF, CLUSTERS OF DRUPES, WE EAT THE WHOLE THING. OF COURSE, THE ONE DRAWBACK TO DRUPES IS THAT THEY CAN BE KIND OF HARD TO GET TO. stupid thing. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WELL, I'M TRYING TO OPEN THIS STU... YOUR NUT, PROBABLY. YEAH... FATHER, SON... YOU MUST BE THE ELLIS BOYS, RIGHT? YES. YEAH, HEY, HOW ARE YOU DOING? I WASN'T GONNA KEEP THESE... IT'S JUST RESEARCH, REALLY. HOW DO YOU OPEN THESE DARN THINGS? WELL, YOU JUST WORK ON IT A LITTLE BIT THERE. WHAT IS THAT? THAT'S A SHELLER... A HAND SHELLER. WHERE DO YOU GET THAT KIND OF THING? OH, YOU CAN GET THEM AT THE LOCAL HARDWARE STORE. A HARDWARE STORE, YEAH? ALL RIGHT... WELL, I GOTTA SEE ABOUT THAT. WHO WAS THAT GUY? UNLESS YOU'RE REALLY INTO NUTS, SHELLING OUT $20 FOR A GIZMO THAT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING BUT SHELL NUTS IS IN ITSELF NUTS. NO, THE ONLY TOOL IN OUR KITCHEN THAT GETS BY ON SINGLE DUTY IS A FIRE EXTINGUISHER. EVERYTHING ELSE... HA-HA! HAS GOT TO MULTI-TASK. THE WAY WE SEE IT, IF YOU'RE ONLY GOING TO MAKE FRUITCAKE ONCE A YEAR, AND LET'S FACE IT, MOST OF US ARE ONLY GOING TO MAKE FRUITCAKE ONCE A YEAR, YOU MIGHT AS WELL GO ALL OUT AND SHELL YOUR OWN NUTS. IT'S NOT THAT THERE'S ANYTHING WRONG WITH SHELLED AND BAGGED NUTS. IT'S JUST THAT THESE ARE A WHOLE LOT BETTER. NOW SINCE WE'RE GONNA BREAK THESE UP BEFORE THEY GO INTO THE FINAL CAKE, I DON'T REALLY WORRY TOO MUCH ABOUT GETTING THE MEATS OUT WHOLE. BUT WHAT YOU DO WANT TO AVOID IS... OH, OF COURSE IT'S NICE WHEN IT HAPPENS. YOU WANT TO AVOID GETTING SHELLS IN THE NUTS. NOT ONLY ARE THEY INCREDIBLY BITTER, BUT IN THE MOUTH, IT'S KIND OF LIKE CHEWING ON SHRAPNEL. NOW WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO ACTUAL YIELDS, IT REALLY DEPENDS ON THE VARIETY OF PECAN. BUT ON AVERAGE, YOU CAN COUNT ON ABOUT 1 1/2 CUPS OF MEAT FOR EVERY POUND OF SHELL NUTS. NOW HOW MANY ARE YOU GONNA NEED? WELL, WE'LL GET TO THAT... BUT I HAVE TO ADMIT, PERSONALLY, I NEVER SIT DOWN WITHOUT CRACKING TWO POUNDS' WORTH. NOW YOU'LL GET TEN TIMES MORE FLAVOR OUT OF YOUR NUTS-- OR DRUPE SEEDS-- IF YOU TOAST THEM BEFORE ADDING THEM TO THE CAKE. BUT BEWARE... BECAUSE OF THEIR HIGH FAT CONTENT, THESE LITTLE BABIES BURN QUICKER THAN... ELVES ON MIAMI BEACH, SO 300 DEGREES FOR 15 MINUTES. THEN CHECK ON THEM--SHAKING-- EVERY TWO TO THREE MINUTES THEREAFTER UNTIL THEY REACH A GOLDEN MAHOGANY COLOR. AND REMEMBER, IF YOU CAN SMELL NUTS-- OR DRUPE SEEDS--IN THE KITCHEN, THEY'RE BURNED. EVERYONE OWES SOMETHING TO SPICES. THE WORLD, FOR INSTANCE, OWES ITS GEOPOLITICAL, CULTURAL AND ECONOMIC SHAPE TO MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST FOR SPICES. A GOOD FRUITCAKE OWES ITS DEPTH OF FLAVOR, ITS HOLIDAYNESS, TO GOOD SPICES. AS FOR US COOKS, WELL, WE OWE IT TO SPICES TO HANDLE THEM CORRECTLY, STORE THEM CORRECTLY AND ACQUIRE THEM FROM REPUTABLE SOURCES, LIKE PATTY ERD, HERE, WHO RUNS THE SPICE HOUSE, OUTSIDE OF CHICAGO, WITH HER HUSBAND TOM. HI, PATTY. HI. SO WHY SHOULD I BOTHER BUYING WHOLE SPICES WHEN I CAN BUY EVERYTHING GROUND UP AT THE GROCERY STORE? BECAUSE THEN YOU HAVE THE DEFINITE ADVANTAGE OF BEING ABLE TO GRIND YOUR SPICES-- RELEASING THEIR ESSENTIAL OILS-- WHEN YOU WANT TO. AND ALSO, YOU CAN STORE THEM FOR LONG TERM, FOR A PERIOD OF SEVERAL YEARS, UNTIL YOU NEED TO GRIND THEM. OKAY. SO ONCE THEY'RE GROUND, IT'S LIKE A TICKING TIME BOMB. IT'S ALL OVER, RIGHT? YEAH, SPICES... THEN THEY'VE RELEASED THEIR VOLATILE OILS, AND THEY START TO DISSIPATE IMMEDIATELY AFTER GRINDING. AND DOWN AT THE GROCERY STORE, THE STUFF THAT'S GROUND UP IN THE TIN, EVEN THOUGH IT'S IN AN AIRTIGHT CONTAINER, GENERALLY SPEAKING, YEAH. IT'S PRETTY MUCH OVER? THE FDA DOESN'T PUT ANY SHELF LIFE ON SPICES, SO IN THE STORE IT'S PROBABLY NOT VERY FRESH. OKAY. PATTY, YOU'VE BEEN KIND ENOUGH TO SET UP EVERYTHING THAT I NEED FOR MY FRUITCAKE. I'VE GOT CINNAMON, CLOVE, GINGER, ALLSPICE, BUT I CAN'T HELP BUT NOTICE EVERYTHING IS WHOLE EXCEPT THE CINNAMON... HOW COME? WHEN YOU BUY CINNAMON STICKS IN THE STORE, THEY'RE FROM INDONESIA, AND THEY'RE A VERY LOW GRADE... TOP PART OF THE CINNAMON TREE. WHEN WE GRIND CINNAMON, WE HAVE A LOWER PART OF THE BARK, AND THAT'S WHERE THE REALLY MACHO CASH OF CINNAMON BARK IS. MACHO BARK! THE MACHO BARK. WE'LL SHOW YOU SOME MACHO BARK LATER. THAT'S ANOTHER SHOW. OKAY. CLOVES... THOSE ARE ACTUALLY WHAT? LITTLE SPIKY THINGS. THEY'RE THE UNOPENED BUD OF A CLOVE TREE. WHEN THEY FLOWER THEY PRODUCE A BEAUTIFUL PINK FLOWER. SO AS LONG AS IT STAYS IN ITS DRIED FLOWER FORM, THE FLAVOR'S PROTECTED. YES. IT'S PROTECTED FOR SEVERAL YEARS. NOW I DON'T THINK MUCH OF AMERICA... I KNOW I HAVEN'T BOUGHT MY GINGER THIS WAY. THAT'S A RHIZOME, RIGHT? THAT'S A RHIZOME, CORRECT. THAT'S THE ROOT. PEOPLE THINK IT'S A ROOT, BUT IT'S A RHIZOME. WHY SHOULD I BUY IT LIKE THIS, OTHER THAN GROUND? THERE'S SOME VERY FINE-QUALITY GINGER THAT THEY ONLY DRY AND THEN THEY SHIP IT ACROSS THE OCEAN. THIS IS CHINA NUMBER ONE GINGER. IT'S THE TOP QUALITY OF GINGER THAT YOU CAN BUY, BUT IT CAN ONLY BE SOLD DRY, BECAUSE IT CAN'T MAKE THE TRANSPORT OVER FROM CHINA TO HERE IN ITS FRESH FORM. THEY TAKE THE GOOD STUFF AND THEY SAY "WE'RE GONNA DRY THAT OUT." YES. A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T THINK ABOUT GRINDING THEIR OWN GINGER, BUT IT'S A VERY SIMPLE THING TO DO. YOU JUST USE A... LIKE YOU WOULD DO A NUTMEG GRATER. YEAH, JUST LIKE THIS. WOW, THAT IS GOOD. FRESH! HOW LONG WILL THAT KEEP LIKE THAT? IT WILL KEEP YEARS LIKE THIS. IF I KEEP IT ALL SEALED UP. YES. AND YOU WANT TO GET THEM IN AIRTIGHT GLASS CONTAINERS. THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. SOME TYPE OF A MASON JAR? A MASON JAR WILL WORK JUST FINE. BUT THE LESS AIR THAT CAN GET AT THE SPICES, THE BETTER. SO AIR IS THE ENEMY? AIR IS THE ENEMY OF SPICE. CAN YOU FREEZE ANY OF THESE? YES... YOU CAN FREEZE ALL YOUR SPICES. THE ESSENTIAL OILS, THEY DON'T MIND? NO, BUT YOU HAVE A TENDENCY TO FORGET THAT THEY'RE IN A LITTLE THING IN THE FREEZER. YOU'VE SEEN MY FREEZER BEFORE. THE FOUR WHOLE CLOVES AND SIX ALLSPICE BERRIES MAY NOT SEEM LIKE MUCH, BUT YOU'VE GOT TO REMEMBER THAT LIKE COFFEE, WHOLE, FRESH-GROUND SPICES ARE ABOUT TEN TIMES STRONGER THAN IF THEY'D BEEN GROUND AND JUST LEFT ON A GROCERY STORE SHELF FOR SIX MONTHS. SO THIS GOES STRAIGHT IN ON TOP OF THE RUMMED FRUIT, WHICH HAS MIRACULOUSLY RELOCATED INTO A LARGE POT. ADD TO THAT A TEASPOON OF CINNAMON, OR CASSIA IF YOU WANT TO BE TECHNICAL, AND A TEASPOON OF GROUND GINGER. NOW AGAIN, I CAN'T OVEREMPHASIZE THAT YOU WANT TO USE THE BEST SPICES YOU CAN FIND. THEY'RE THE WHOLE BACKBONE OF THE CAKE. NOW ALSO, TEN TABLESPOONS OF UNSALTED BUTTER... THAT'S A STICK AND A QUARTER. A CUP OF UNFILTERED APPLE JUICE-- YOU CAN USE THE FILTERED KIND IF YOU WANT, BUT THE FLAVOR WON'T QUITE BE AS DEEP. AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST, A CUP OF SUGAR, WHICH ISN'T MUCH AT ALL. I'LL BRING THIS TO A BOIL OVER MEDIUM-HIGH HEAT. AND AS SOON AS IT HITS A BOIL, BACK OFF ON THE HEAT AND BRING IT DOWN JUST TO A SIMMER, SO IT'S JUST BARELY BUBBLING. BESIDES MELTING THE BUTTER AND THE SUGAR, THIS PERIOD'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR FLAVOR DEVELOPMENT. YOU'VE GOT ALL THOSE SPICES AND ALL THOSE FRUITS, AND THEY REALLY NEED TIME TO DEVELOP AND MINGLE. BESIDES, AT THIS POINT, ALL THE FLAVOR THAT THIS CAKE WILL EVER HAVE, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE NUTS, IS IN THIS POT. SO DON'T UNDERDEVELOP IT. LISTEN... HERE IT IS, OKAY. WE'RE GONNA SEND THE GINSU'S TO EMERIL, RIGHT? BUT ON THE LITTLE "FROM" THING ON THE LABEL, WE'LL SAY IT'S FROM THE IRON CHEFS... HEH-HEH! IT'LL BE GREAT, HE'LL... I HAVE TO GO. ONCE 5 TO 10 MINUTES HAS PASSED, GET THIS OFF THE HEAT AND LET IT COOL DOWN FOR ANOTHER 10 TO 15 MINUTES. WHY THE REST? WELL, WE'VE GOT DRY INGREDIENTS TO ADD INTO THIS, MOST OF WHICH IS FLOUR. IF FLOUR HITS ALL THAT HOT LIQUID NOW, IT'S JUST GONNA GELATINIZE INTO A BIG KIND OF GOOEY MASS. LUMPS OF COAL MAY BE OKAY AS CHRISTMAS GIFTS, BUT LUMPS OF FLOUR ARE NEVER FASHIONABLE. NOW IF YOU DON'T REALLY WANT TO FINISH THE BAKING RIGHT NOW, THIS IS A GOOD PLACE TO STOP. JUST LET THIS COOL TO ROOM TEMPERATURE, COVER AND REFRIGERATE. IT'LL KEEP FOR TWO TO THREE DAYS. JUST MAKE SURE THAT YOU BRING IT BACK TO ROOM TEMPERATURE BEFORE YOU FINISH BUILDING THE BATTER. CAKE BATTERS COME TOGETHER SMOOTHER IF THE DRY INGREDIENTS ARE SIFTED DIRECTLY INTO THE WET. SO WE'RE GOING TO SIFT IN 1 3/4 CUPS OF FLOUR, 1 1/2 TEASPOON OF KOSHER SALT, ONE TEASPOON OF BAKING SODA AND ONE TEASPOON OF BAKING POWDER. NOW WHILE THE SALT IS ENHANCING THE FLAVOR OF THE FRUIT, THE BAKING SODA WILL BE NEUTRALIZING THE OVERALL ACID OF THE MIXTURE, WHICH WILL ALLOW THE BAKING POWDER TO DO WHAT IT DOES BEST, WHICH IS MAKE CARBON DIOXIDE GAS. NOW BELIEVE IT OR NOT, HOW YOU STIR AND WHAT YOU STIR WITH REALLY DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE, WHICH IS WHY I LIKE THIS BIG, HONKIN', MEDIEVAL WOODEN SPOON. WHAT THIS DOES IS IT ALLOWS YOU TO KIND OF BRING THE CAKE TOGETHER VERY, VERY QUICKLY. AND THAT MEANS WE'LL HAVE A DENSER, RATHER THAN LIGHT AND AIRY CAKE. WE MAY NOT BE MAKING DOORSTOPS HERE, BUT WE'RE NOT MAKING ANGEL FOOD CAKE, EITHER. NOW ENGLISH TRADITION HOLDS THAT IN ORDER FOR A FRUITCAKE TO BRING LUCK TO EVERYBODY IN THE HOUSEHOLD, ALL THE FAMILY MEMBERS HAVE TO HOLD ON TO THE SPOON WHILE STIRRING. NOW AS SOON AS THE BATTER STARTS TO COME TOGETHER, IT'S TIME TO ADD TWO EGGS. BUT ADD THEM ONE AT A TIME, MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE FULLY INTEGRATED BEFORE THE NEXT ONE GOES IN. THANK YOU. NOW THE LAST THING TO GO IN IS GOING TO BE THE NUTS. YOU WANT TO ADD AT LEAST A 1/4 CUP OF TOASTED, CRUSHED PECANS, BUT IF YOU'RE A NUT NUT LIKE ME, YOU CAN GO AS HIGH AS A CUP AND NOT DO ANY STRUCTURAL DAMAGE TO THE CAKE WHATSOEVER. IN THE GOOD OL' DAYS, AT LEAST 1/3 OF EVERY FRUITCAKE RECIPE DEALT EXCLUSIVELY WITH PAN PREPARATION. THERE WAS THE INTRICATE CUTTING OF WAXED PAPER OR EVEN BROWN PAPER BAGS... THEN EVERYTHING GOT GREASED. IT WAS DISGUSTING--BUT NO MORE. THIS RECIPE HAS BEEN FORMULATED FOR A SINGLE TEN-INCH, NON-STICK LOAF PAN, BUT YOU'VE GOT PLENTY OF OPTIONS. BESIDES VARIOUS LOAF SIZES, YOU CAN GO WITH ROUND OR EVEN A TUBE PAN. YOU CAN MAKE MUFFINS IF YOU WANT TO. BUT REGARDLESS OF THE COOKING VESSEL, BAKE AT 325 DEGREES. NOW THIS LOAF WILL TAKE ABOUT AN HOUR, BUT YOUR COOKING TIME WILL VARY DEPENDING ON THE PAN, SO MAKE SURE YOU'VE GOT WOODEN TOOTHPICKS FOR TESTING. IF IT COMES OUT CLEAN, IT'S DONE. IF IT'S GOOEY, LEAVE IT ALONE. NOW SINCE CONTINUOUS OVEN OPENING IS EVIL, I'M NOT EVEN GOING TO CHECK ON THIS FOR THE FIRST 50 MINUTES. OH, A PAN OF HOT WATER ON THE BOTTOM RACK OF THE OVEN WILL HELP PREVENT THE OUTER CRUST OF THE CAKE FROM DRAWING AND CRACKING DURING THE LONG STAY IN THE OVEN. IT SMELLS DONE. LOOKS DONE. YEP, IT'S DONE. NOW WHILE IT'S HOT, I'M GONNA HIT IT WITH A LITTLE BIT OF BRANDY. YOU COULD BASTE THIS ON IF YOU WANT TO, BUT I THINK THE SPRITZER IS A LOT MORE EFFICIENT. BESIDES ADDING A LITTLE BIT OF FLAVOR AT THIS LEVEL OF THE CAKE, THIS IS ALSO GONNA KEEP THE TOP CRUST FROM CRACKING AS THE CAKE COOLS DOWN. LET THIS COOL COMPLETELY BEFORE DE-PANING. ALTHOUGH YOUR CAKE IS DELICIOUS RIGHT NOW, THE FLAVOR WILL ACTUALLY IMPROVE WITH TIME, AT LEAST FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS. NOW AS SOON AS IT COOLS DOWN, LAY IT TO REST IN THE AIRTIGHT CONTAINER OF YOUR CHOICE, PREFERABLY SOMETHING WITH A LITTLE BIT OF BREATHING ROOM. CHECK ON IT EVERY TWO OR THREE DAYS, AND WHEN IT FEELS LIKE IT'S DRYING OUT, JUST SPRITZ IT AGAIN WITH THE BRANDY. THUS INTERRED, YOUR CAKE'S FLAVOR WILL COMPOUND DAILY, JUST LIKE THE INTEREST ON ALL THOSE HOLIDAY CREDIT CARD CHARGES YOU MADE-- EXCEPT IN A GOOD WAY. NOW I LIKE MINE FOR BREAKFAST, TOASTED, WITH A LITTLE BIT OF MASCARPONE CHEESE. IT BEATS THE GYM SHORTS OFF A POWER BAR ANY DAY. I'M ALTON BROWN. THIS IS "GOOD EATS," AND... OKAY, EVERYBODY. LET'S HAVE A BIG "HAPPY HOLIDAYS." (everybody) HAPPY HOLIDAYS, EVERYBODY! I DON'T THINK THAT WAS EVERYBODY, "W." OH, WHATEVER!
