 LIKE GREAT CULTURAL TECTONIC PLATES FOREVER HELD IN CHECK...
 FACTORY VERSUS PLANTATION,
 YANKEE INGENUITY VERSUS SOUTHERN HOSPITALITY,
 LEONARD BERSTEIN VERSUS LYNYRD SKYNYRD--
 EVERYTHING SYMMETRICALLY BALANCED.
 UNTIL IT COMES TO BISCUITS.
 SEE, THE NORTHERN BISCUIT HAS A DISTINCTLY NAUTICAL HERITAGE.
 THE WORD BISCUIT AFTER ALL, IS FROM A OLD FRENCH PHRASE,
 BIS CUIT--IT MEANS TWICE BAKED, AND REFERS TO THE METHOD
 THAT WAS NECESSARY TO KEEP OCEAN-GOING SAILOR WAFERS
 FROM GOING STALE AT SEA.
 THESE WERE NUTRITIOUS LITTLE GUT BOMBS,
 BUT THEY HAD THE TEXTURE OF A ROCK,
 AND ONLY HALF THE FLAVOR.
 NOW SOUTHERN BISCUITS, ON THE OTHER HAND,
 HAIL DIRECTLY FROM ENGLISH SCONES.
 AND THEY ARE SO LIGHT, SO FLUFFY,
 SO JUST DOWN-AND-OUT DELICIOUS, THAT I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED
 IF SHERMAN MARCH TO THE SEA WAS NOTHING MORE
 THAN A BISCUIT RUN, RUN AMUCK.
 OR MAYBE HE JUST DIDN'T LIKE BANJOS.
 NAH.
 THE SOUTHERN BISCUIT IS MUCH MORE THAN MERE SOCIAL ICON.
 THE CUCKOO ATTAINS BISCUITHOOD,
 WELL, THEY RECEIVED THE KEYS TO QUICK BREAD CITY.
 DUMPLINGS, SCONES, SODA BREAD, SHORTCAKE,
 ALL FALL WITHIN EASY GRASP.
 IN SHORT...
 THE BISCUIT IS A POWERFUL TOOL,
 NOT TO MENTION SERIOUSLY "GOOD EATS."
 ♪
 MAKING BISCUITS IS LIKE PLAYING ROCK-'N'-ROLL...
 YOU ONLY NEED THREE CORDS AND A LOT OF VOLUME.
 NOW THE BISCUIT CORDS ARE FLOUR, FAT AND MOISTURE.
 NOW FIRST THE FLOUR... AMONG WHEAT FLOURS ALONE WE'VE GOT,
 WELL, THERE'S ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR,
 THERE'S SELF-RISING FLOUR,
 WE'VE GOT BREAD FLOUR,
 UNBLEACHED, ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR.
 LET'S SEE, THEN THERE'S CAKE FLOUR
 AND DOZENS OF OTHERS.
 NOW WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE SELF-RISING,
 WHICH CONTAINS CHEMICAL LEAVENERS,
 THE MAIN DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ALL THESE FLOURS
 IS MOSTLY PROTEIN CONTENT.
 AND THAT DEPENDS A GREAT DEAL ON WHEAT.
 NOW ABOUT 75 PERCENT OF THE WHEAT GROWN IN AMERICA
 IS HARD WHEAT, MEANING THAT IT'S HIGH IN PROTEIN.
 NOW FLOUR MADE FROM THIS KIND OF WHEAT
 IS OFTEN MARKETED AS BREAD FLOUR,
 BECAUSE IT FORMS THE KIND OF PLASTIC STRUCTURE
 THAT FRENCH BAGUETTES AND CRUSTY SOUR DOUGH ROLLS DEPEND ON.
 SOFT WHEAT, BECAUSE IT CONTAINS LESS PROTEIN,
 IS MORE SUITED FOR SOFTER BAKING GOODS,
 LIKE CAKES, PASTRIES AND BISCUITS.
 THESE KIND OF SOFT FLOURS ARE TRADITIONAL IN SOUTHERN BAKING,
 BECAUSE BEFORE MODERN TRANSPORTATION,
 THAT'S WHAT THEY HAD.
 NOW JUST AS SOME TRADITIONAL NORTHERN HARD FLOURS
 HAVE BECOME AVAILABLE IN THE SOUTH, SOME SOUTHERN FLOURS,
 OFTEN LABELED AS BETTER FOR BISCUITS,
 ARE STARTING TO SHOW UP ON NORTHERN SHELVES.
 ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR, BY THE WAY,
 IS USUALLY A MIXTURE OF HARD AND SOFT FLOURS.
 AP, AS IT'S CALLED, IS FINE FOR MOST BAKING CHORES,
 BUT JUST AS YOU'LL NEVER MAKE A GREAT BAGUETTE WITH IT,
 BISCUITS, TOO, WILL ELUDE YOU.
 NOW IN A PINCH, YOU CAN CONCOCT YOUR OWN BISCUIT FLOUR
 BY MIXING THREE PARTS OF ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR
 WITH ONE PART OF CAKE FLOUR.
 IT'LL GET YOU CLOSE.
 NOTHIN' LIKE LARD FOR A FLAKY PIE CRUST, HUH?
 OH, THIS, THIS ISN'T FOR ME, NO, NO.
 I WOULD NEVER COOK WITH THIS.
 THIS IS FOR...
 ONE OF THOSE CONTESTS WITH THE GREASED WATERMELON.
 THE GREASY WATERMELON CONTEST. YEAH, GREASED WATERMELON.
 GOT IT!
 WHETHER FAT PHOBICS LIKE IT OR NOT,
 FAT, ESPECIALLY FATS THAT ARE SOLID AT ROOM TEMPERATURE,
 PLAY A CRUCIAL ROLE IN THE TEXTURE OF BAKED GOODS.
 NOW TAKE THIS VEGETABLE SHORTENING...
 NOT ONLY WILL IT TENDERIZE AND MOISTEN OUR BISCUITS
 BY SURROUNDING THE STARCH GRANULES,
 EVEN A VERY SMALL AMOUNT WILL CREATE
 A DRAMATIC INCREASE IN DOUGH VOLUME.
 NOW ANY SOLID FAT CAN BE USED IN BISCUITS.
 BUTTER LENDS GREAT TASTE BUT IFFY TEXTURE,
 WHILE LARD PRODUCES A VERY TENDER CRUMB,
 BUT HAS A TOUCH OF GAMINESS.
 VEGETABLE SHORTENING IS NEUTRAL IN FLAVOR,
 PRODUCES A LIGHT TEXTURE, HAS A LONG SHELF LIFE,
 AND IS EASY TO WORK WITH.
 NOW I LIKE TO USE SHORTENING FOR TEXTURE,
 ALONG WITH A LITTLE BIT OF BUTTER, JUST FOR FLAVOR.
 ♪
 TO BRING THE OTHER INGREDIENTS TOGETHER
 AND SUPPLY THE MOISTURE NEEDED FOR A GOOD RISE,
 THE LAST OF THE BISCUIT POWER CORDS IS LIQUID,
 USUALLY IN THE FORM OF MILK, CREAM OR BETTER YET, BUTTERMILK.
 NOW I ACCIDENTALLY PUT SOME OF THIS STUFF IN MY CEREAL
 WHEN I WAS ABOUT THREE, AND I GOT TO TELL YA,
 I NEVER GOT OVER IT.
 BUT WHEN IT COMES TO BISCUITS, THERE'S JUST NO SUBSTITUTING
 THE SOUR TWANG OF BUTTERMILK.
 EITHER LOW FAT OR FAT FREE WILL DO FINE.
 AND SINCE IT'S BASICALLY SPOILED ALREADY,
 IT KEEPS FOR A LONG TIME IN THE FRIDGE.
 JUST DON'T CONFUSE IT WITH SKIM, COME SATURDAY MORNING.
 HERE AT "GOOD EATS," WE MAKE A HABIT OF TRAFFICKING
 IN CULTURAL ICONS.
 AND WHAT COULD BE MORE CULTURALLY ICONOCLASTIC THAN...
 THE AMERICAN GRANDMOTHER.
 THAT'S RIGHT, AND THIS IS NOT A TV GRANDMOTHER,
 THIS IS MY REAL GRANDMOTHER-- I CALL HER MA MAE.
 HEY MA MAE, DID YOU GET THOSE WEIGHTS MOVED UP TO THE ATTIC?
 YOU'RE AS MEAN AS A SNAKE.
 THIS IS GONNA BE GREAT.
 MA MAE FED ME MY FIRST BISCUIT BACK WHEN I WAS ABOUT YEA TALL.
 AND I'VE BEEN STUDYING HOW TO MAKE THEM AT HER KNEE,
 LIKE LUKE SKYWALKER AT YODA'S PLACE,
 FOR DECADES NOW.
 SO THE FIRST STEP TO MAKING BISCUITS
 IS TO PREHEAT THE OVEN TO 400 DEGREES, RIGHT?
 FOUR-SEVENTY-FIVE.
 FOUR-SEVENTY-FIVE, I SAY 400.
 NEXT WE MAKE BISCUITS.
 ♪
 THE BATTLE LINE HAS BEEN DRAWN,
 WE ARE AT BATTLEGROUND BISCUIT.
 NOW ALTHOUGH MA MAE HERE, TAUGHT ME HOW TO MAKE BISCUITS,
 AND EVERY BISCUIT THAT I'VE EVER HAD
 HAS BASICALLY TRIED TO LIVE UP TO HERS,
 OVER THE YEARS MY METHODOLOGY
 HAS DEFIANTLY SPREAD INTO A DIFFERENT DIRECTION,
 ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO MEASURING,
 AND MEASURING IS REALLY KIND OF THE FIRST PLACE
 THAT YOU CAN GO WRONG IN BISCUITING.
 NOW WHEN YOU'VE MADE BISCUITS FOR LIKE, 175 YEARS,
 LIKE MA MAE HAS,
 THEN YOU KNOW WHAT THINGS SHOULD LOOK LIKE,
 AND FEEL LIKE.
 BUT FOR THE BEGINNING BISCUITMAKER, AND EVEN FOR ME,
 I STILL MEASURE EVERYTHING.
 SO WE HAVE THE DIFFERENCES IN METHODOLOGY HERE,
 MA MAE USING ARTIFACTS FOUND IN BURIAL GROUNDS
 FROM, LIKE, THE FIFTH CENTURY... WHAT IS THAT?
 THAT IS A BISCUIT CUTTER.
 THAT'S NOT ORIGINAL MATERIAL, THERE?
 WELL, THEY BROUGHT THAT OVER ON THE MAYFLOWER.
 GOOD TO KNOW YOU'VE STILL GOT A SENSE OF HUMOR ABOUT THAT.
 OKAY, SO WE'RE BOTH GONNA BE STARTING
 WITH A SOFT, WINTER WHEAT FLOUR.
 WE'RE NOT GONNA NAME BRANDS, BUT...
 MA MAE PREFERS TO USE SELF-RISING FLOUR
 THAT ALREADY HAS THE LEAVENING INGREDIENTS ADDED IN.
 I HAVE TO ADMIT, I VERY OFTEN USE IT AS WELL,
 BUT FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT,
 I'M GONNA BE USING ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR TODAY.
 AND I'M GONNA ADD THE BAKING POWDER AND THE BAKING SODA SEPARATELY.
 AND WE'RE GONNA COME BACK TO MORE OF THOSE LATER.
 YOU READY TO START? READY TO START.
 OKAY, WE'RE GONNA START WITH PHASE ONE, MEASURING...
 I DO IT, SHE DOESN'T, HERE WE GO.
 SHE'LL BE SPOONING OUT HER FLOUR,
 WHILE I WILL BE PRECISELY MEASURING MY INGREDIENTS.
 I USE A DIGITAL SCALE THAT HAS WHAT'S CALLED A TARE WEIGHT ON IT,
 WHICH MEANS I CAN SLAP A BOWL ON THERE
 AND THEN BASICALLY SUBTRACT THE WEIGHT OF THE BOWL.
 NOW MA MAE GOES WITH TWO CUPS OF FLOUR,
 AND I BASICALLY DO TOO, ONLY MY TWO CUPS OF FLOUR
 GENERALLY WEIGHS OUT TO ABOUT TEN OUNCES.
 YOU'LL ALSO NOTICE THAT SHE SIFTS HER FLOUR... WHY DO YOU DO THAT?
 MAKE IT LIGHTER. SHE SAYS IT MAKES it LIGHTER.
 I'M NOT SO SURE, WE'LL HAVE TO BE THE JUDGE LATER ON.
 I'VE GOT TEN OUNCES OF FLOUR,
 AND I SUSPECT THAT BECAUSE SHE SIFTS HER FLOUR,
 SHE'S PROBABLY USING A LITTLE LESS THAN I AM,
 BECAUSE THE GRAINS IN HER FLOUR ARE GONNA
 KIND OF BE LIFTED AWAY FROM EACH OTHER,
 WHILE MINE ARE MORE COMPACT.
 OKAY, I'M GONNA GO AHEAD
 AND ADD FOUR TEASPOONS OF BAKING POWDER,
 WHICH IS THE SAME AS ONE TEASPOON PLUS ONE TABLESPOON.
 NOW BAKING POWDER IS INTERESTING STUFF, BECAUSE IT'S BALANCED.
 IT HOLDS BOTH ACID AND ALKAINE,
 SO IT CAN RISE ALL BY ITSELF,
 WITHOUT ANY OTHER CHEMICAL AGENTS.
 AND I'M GONNA ADD ABOUT A QUARTER TEASPOON OF BAKING SODA--
 A TINY, TINY, LITTLE AMOUNT.
 IT'S GONNA GIVE US A LITTLE BIT BETTER OF A RISE,
 ESPECIALLY WITH THE ACID THAT'S IN THE BUTTERMILK WE'RE USING.
 BUT THE REASON I ALSO USE A VERY SMALL AMOUNT
 IS THAT IT WILL FLAVOR THINGS--IT'S GOT A LOT OF SODIUM IN IT--
 AND IF YOU USE A LOT YOU'LL TASTE IT.
 YOU HAVIN' A HARD TIME WITH THAT THING THERE? UH-HUM.
 OKAY, SO WE'RE DONE WITH THE MEASURING PART, THE DRY STUFF. YES.
 OKAY, SO YOU'RE READY TO GO.
 GIVE ME A SECOND, LET ME STIR THIS UP.
 OH, SALT...
 HER FLOUR ALREADY HAS SALT WORKED INTO IT,
 AND YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE SALT FOR ANY KIND OF BREAD,
 OR IT JUST TASTES... I DON'T KNOW, WHAT DOES IT TASTE LIKE
 WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE ANY SALT IN IT? IT'S JUST FLAT.
 FLAT, DEAD, FLAT.
 SO I'M GONNA ADD ABOUT--
 THAT'S ABOUT A TEASPOON OF SALT.
 YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE KOSHER SALT,
 BUT IT'S PRETTY MUCH THE ONLY KIND I USE.
 NOW MA MAE HAS MOVED ON, PULLING IN FRONT
 INTO THE CUTTING IN OF THE FAT.
 AGAIN, RENEGADE THAT SHE IS, NO MEASURING,
 JUST DIVING RIGHT IN THERE.
 AND SHE'S GONNA CUT IT IN... WHY DO YOU USE A SPOON?
 I GUESS BECAUSE I LIKE TO.
 WELL, YOUR MOM DIDN'T USE A SPOON, I KNOW, I REMEMBER. NO, SHE USED HER HANDS.
 MY GREAT-GRANDMOTHER USED HER HANDS.
 IT WAS GOOD ENOUGH FOR HER, IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME...
 YOU JUST--IT'S ALL THAT FANCY JEWELRY YOU'RE WEARING,
 I SUSPECT.
 SURE, THAT'S IT. I'M GONNA WEIGH MINE, AND WHAT I LIKE TO DO
 IS I LIKE TO HAVE MY FAT COLD WHEN I CUT IT IN.
 SO WHAT I'M GONNA DO IS I'M GONNA GO AHEAD
 AND MEASURE OUT MY BUTTERMILK,
 AND I LIKE TO USE A CUP OF BUTTERMILK.
 AND SINCE A PINT IS A POUND, THE WORLD AROUND,
 EIGHT OUNCES FLUID MEASURE
 EQUALS EIGHT OUNCES OF WEIGHT.
 SO I CAN JUST LOOK AT MY SCALE AND I'VE GOT EIGHT OUNCES,
 WHICH IS THE SAME AS A CUP.
 AND I'M GONNA PUT IN TWO OUNCES,
 ACTUALLY, MORE LIKE AN OUNCE OF BUTTER,
 AND I'M JUST GONNA ADD IT STRAIGHT TO THIS UNTIL I GET ONE OUNCE.
 I'M GONNA HIT THE TARE WEIGHT AGAIN.
 SHE'S ALREADY SMOKIN' ME.
 SLOW DOWN, YOU MAKE ME LOOK BAD!
 HOW OLD'S THAT BOWL?
 THAT'S THE ONLY ONE I HAVE EVER SEEN YOU MAKE BISCUITS IN.
 WELL, THAT'S OLDER THAN YOU ARE. A LOT OF THINGS ARE.
 THANK GOODNESS THAT WE'RE STILL AT THAT POINT.
 I'M GONNA ADD ALSO TWO OUNCES OF SHORTENING.
 SHE LIKES ALL SHORTENING,
 I LIKE TO USE A LITTLE BIT OF BOTH.
 SHORTENING'S GONNA GIVE YOU A BETTER TEXTURE, RIGHT?
 RIGHT. IT'S JUST LIGHTER, KIND OF THING.
 NOW YOU REMEMBER USING LARD FOR BISCUITS, DON'T YOU?
 YES, IN MY EARLY YEARS OF LIFE,
 I DID USE LARD.
 LIKE AROUND THE TIME OF "GONE WITH THE WIND"?
 I LIKE TO USE A COMBINATION.
 YOU'RE GONNA GET A TENDER TOOTH,
 A TENDER CRUMB, OUT OF THE BISCUIT FROM SHORTENING.
 YOU'RE GONNA GET A LITTLE BIT OF FLAVOR IF YOU USE BUTTER.
 YOU DON'T WAIT ON ME, YOU KEEP GOING, I'LL CATCH UP.
 NOW WHERE SHE CUTS HERS IN WITH A SPOON, I LIKE TO USE MY FINGERS.
 BUT WHEN YOU DO THIS, TRY TO USE JUST YOUR FINGERTIPS.
 I KNOW IT LOOKS MESSY, BUT DON'T WORRY.
 AND JUST KIND OF WORK IT IN.
 WHAT WE'RE WANTING IS SOMETHING THAT LOOKS KIND OF LIKE CORNMEAL,
 SO JUST BREAK IT UP AND WORK IT IN.
 THIS IS A LOT MORE FUN THAN HER METHOD.
 ALL RIGHT, SHE'S ALREADY GOING ON THE BUTTERMILK.
 HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK YOU USE?
 I NEVER MEASURE IT, I JUST PUT IN THERE WHAT I THINK IT NEEDS,
 AND STIR IT 'TIL IT'S DONE.
 SHE AND I BOTH LIKE A VERY LOOSE DOUGH.
 ONE OF THE GREAT SECRETS, WHAT SHE'S TAUGHT ME
 IS THE SECRET, REALLY, TO BISCUIT MAKING
 IS A VERY, VERY WET DOUGH
 THAT YOU DON'T WORK VERY MUCH, RIGHT? RIGHT.
 JUST STIR IT UNTIL IT COMES TOGETHER INTO A STICKY MASS.
 IF IT LOOKS STICKY AND NASTY, YOU'RE GOING THE RIGHT WAY.
 SHE LIKES TO DO THIS ON PARCHMENT PAPER,
 WHICH MAKES FOR A SLIGHTLY NEATER KITCHEN.
 I DON'T REALLY GET TOO WORKED UP ABOUT THAT.
 NOW THAT I'VE GOT THE FAT WORKED IN,
 IT JUST LOOKS CRUMBY, IT KIND OF LOOKS LIKE BREADCRUMBS, ALMOST.
 I'M GONNA MAKE A WELL RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE,
 AND I'M GONNA ADD MY BUTTERMILK.
 I LOST MY SPOON, MA MAE, CAN I USE YOURS?
 CAN I USE YOUR SACRED SPOON? YOU MAKE FUN OF MY SPOON.
 IT'S A WONDERFUL SPOON,
 WEIGHTED PERFECTLY FOR BISCUIT MAKING.
 OH, SHE'S AHEAD OF ME ALREADY,
 THIS IS LOOKIN' PRETTY BAD FOR ME.
 YOU SEE HOW GENTLY SHE'S WORKIN' IT.
 THESE ARE THE HANDS OF A MASTER RIGHT HERE.
 YOU DON'T SEE THIS KIND OF BISCUIT MAKING MUCH IN AMERICA ANYMORE.
 BARELY PATTING IT OUT, NO ROLLING NECESSARY.
 CAN I PUT YOUR SPOON IN THE SINK? YES.
 IF YOU WANT TO WASH A ROLLING PIN, YOU CAN ROLL IT OUT.
 ROLLING PINS JUST AREN'T MY CUP OF TEA.
 GONNA ROLL OUT ENOUGH FLOUR TO KEEP IT FROM STICKIN' ON THE BOARD,
 AND THEN JUST TURN OUT THE WHOLE THING.
 OH, SHE'S GONE FOR HER PAN,
 HER SPECIAL BISCUIT PAN,
 CIRCA 1853, ULYSSES S. GRANT!
 I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE I PUT MY BISCUIT PAN.
 I'VE GOT TO RUN FOR A BISCUIT PAN.
 LIKE MANY OF OUR FAVORITE KITCHEN TOOLS,
 YOU PROBABLY WON'T FIND THE IDEAL BISCUIT PAN AT THE MALL.
 BUT IF YOUR TOWN HAS MORE THAN THREE RESTAURANTS,
 THERE'S PROBABLY A RESTAURANT SUPPLY STORE
 THAT'S OPEN TO THE PUBLIC.
 AND THAT'S WHERE I PROMISE YOU WILL FIND SHEET PANS,
 STANDARD ISSUE FOR THE COMMERCIAL AMERICAN BAKE SHOP.
 UNFORTUNATELY, IT'S A LITTLE LARGE FOR HOME USE,
 BUT FEAR NOT... IT COMES IN HALF SIZE CALLED,
 YUP, A HALF SHEET PAN.
 FORGED FROM A SINGLE PIECE OF HEAVY-DUTY ALUMINUM,
 AND MORE TRUSTWORTHY THAN YOUR DOG,
 THIS PAN IS BUILT TO TAKE IT AND DISH IT OUT.
 NOW ALUMINUM IS AN EXCELLENT CONDUCTOR,
 SO IT HEATS QUICKLY AND RELAYS THAT HEAT NICELY
 TO WHATEVER HAPPENS TO BE SITTING ON TOP.
 NOW UNLIKE NON-STICK OR DARK METAL PANS,
 THIS ONE WON'T BURN BISCUIT BOTTOMS
 BEFORE THE REST OF THE BISCUIT HAS HAD TIME TO COOK.
 SEE THIS LIP... NOT ONLY DOES IT STOP DISASTROUS SLIDES,
 IT ADDS STABILITY, RENDERING THE PAN,
 WELL, VIRTUALLY UNWARPABLE.
 SHOW ME A COOKIE SHEET THAT CAN DO THAT FOR UNDER TEN DOLLARS.
 JUST IN CASE.
 ♪
 THIS WAS PULLED OUT OF A CIVIL WAR BATTLEFIELD,
 LIKE GENERAL GRANT BAKED BISCUITS ON IT.
 YEAH, BUT YOU SURE LOVED THE ONES THAT CAME OUT OF IT.
 WELL, OKAY, THAT'S TRUE,
 BUT I DON'T REMEMBER YOU GREASING THE PAN.
 I DO ALWAYS, LIGHTLY. WELL, I DON'T GREASE MY PAN.
 YOU NOTICE ANOTHER THING THAT SHE DOES, WHICH IS GOOD--
 STRAIGHT DOWN, AND THEN SHE GIVES A LITTLE BIT OF A TWIST.
 IF YOU TWIST YOUR WAY THROUGH BISCUIT DOUGH,
 YOU WON'T GET A CLEAN RISE, RIGHT? RIGHT.
 WHAT ELSE WILL HAPPEN?
 SOMETHING BAD.
 THEY TEAR. I DON'T KNOW, SOMETHING YOU COOKED UP, I GUESS.
 OOH, I HATE TO HEAR THAT KIND OF TALK.
 I USE AN ALUMINUM PAN... I DON'T LIKE STAINLESS STEEL PANS FOR BISCUITS,
 AND I DON'T LIE TEFLON PANS.
 HAVE YOU EVER TRIED TO BAKE BISCUITS ON TEFLON PANS? NO, I HAVEN'T.
 THEY TURN BLACK ON THE BOTTOM.
 IT'S NOT A GOOD THING.
 BISCUIT CUTTER, STRAIGHT DOWN,
 TWIST, POP OUT.
 DOWN, TWIST.
 THE TWIST IS OKAY, BUT ONLY IF YOU'VE GONE ALL THE WAY THROUGH.
 AND YOU NOTICE THAT BOTH SHE AND I
 LIKE TO PUT OUR BISCUITS SHOULDER TO SHOULDER.
 AND THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'LL GET A BETTER RISE OUT OF THEM
 IF THEY'RE JUST TOUCHING.
 IF YOU CROWD THEM TOO MUCH,
 THE HEAT WON'T BE ABLE TO GET IN BETWEEN THE BISCUITS, RIGHT? RIGHT.
 OKAY, I'M RIGHT ON SOMETHING FINALLY--IT'S TAKEN ALL THESE YEARS.
 SO IF YOU HAVE THEM TOO FAR APART, THEY'LL BURN.
 AND THEY'LL SPREAD OUT, WON'T THEY? SURE.
 INSTEAD OF GOING UP.
 SO IF YOU JUST TOUCH THEM NEXT TO EACH OTHER,
 THEY'LL RISE STRAIGHT.
 NOW SHE'S ROLLING OUT HER GARBAGE,
 AS WE SAY, HER TRASH.
 AND YOU ROLL THOSE TOGETHER JUST AS LIGHTLY AS YOU CAN,
 BECAUSE THE DOUGH'S ALREADY BEEN WORKED PERFECTLY,
 YOU DON'T WANT TO GO FAR.
 NOW AS USUAL, I HAVE MORE TRASH ON MY BOARD THAN SHE DOES,
 BUT THAT'S OKAY.
 HOW MANY DO YOU USUALLY GET OUT OF A BATCH?
 YOU ALWAYS GET THE SAME NUMBER? ABOUT TWELVE.
 YOU ALWAYS GET A DOZEN, DON'T YOU.
 MINE ARE A LITTLE BIGGER, SO I'M NOT GOING TO HAVE QUITE AS MANY.
 DOWN AND TWIST. WELL, I'LL HAVE ONE FAT ONE,
 AND THAT USED TO BE THE ONE, WHEN YOU WAS A LITTLE BOY,
 THAT YOU WANTED. WELL, 'CAUSE IT'S BIG, RIGHT?
 YES. BUT I LIKED THEM BEST THE NEXT DAY,
 WHEN YOU SPLIT 'EM OPEN AND YOU BUTTERED THEM,
 AND THEN YOU TOASTED THEM. RIGHT.
 THAT'S THE WAY THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE.
 I'VE PROBABLY EATEN ABOUT 50,000 BISCUITS AT MA MAE'S HOUSE.
 NOW DID YOUR MOM TEACH YOU TO MAKE THESE LIKE THIS? NO, NOT REALLY.
 HOW DID YOU ADAPT YOUR BISCUIT MAKING.
 JUST BY DOING. JUST BY DOING IT, HUH?
 YOU USED TO MAKE THEM EVERY DAY, RIGHT? SURE.
 WHEN I WAS FIRST MARRIED,
 I MADE BISCUITS FOR BREAKFAST EVERY DAY.
 EVERY SINGLE DAY. YES.
 BACK THEN WE WORKED, THOUGH, SO NOBODY GOT FAT OFF OF THEM.
 NOWADAYS, IF I HAD BISCUITS EVERY DAY,
 IT'D BE LIKE, ALFRED HITCHCOCK COOKING HOUR.
 IT'D BE PRETTY BAD.
 OKAY, FOR THE VERY LAST TOUCH--AND FOR GOODNESS SAKES,
 DON'T SKIP THIS--NOTE THE INDENTATION,
 THE SLIGHT INDENTATION.
 NOW I DO MINE WITH THE THUMB.
 MA MAE DOES HERS WITH TWO FINGERS.
 PUSHING DOWN IN THE MIDDLE
 IS GONNA HELP THE BISCUIT TO RISE EVENLY.
 SINCE THE HEAT HITS THE OUTSIDE OF THE BISCUIT AND WORKS IN,
 IF YOU DIDN'T PUNCH IT IN YOU MIGHT END UP WITH A DOMED BISCUIT, RIGHT? RIGHT.
 OKAY, YOU'RE, AH... DO YOU WANT MY BISCUITS IN THE OVEN YET?
 YES, THERE DONE, AREN'T THEY?
 WHY DO YOU NOT WANT TO SIT AROUND AND STARE AT THEM?
 YOU DON'T WANT THEM TO RISE 'TIL THEY GET IN THE OVEN.
 SO THE THE POWER CORDS ARE IN PLACE--FLOUR, FAT, MOISTURE.
 NOW FOR THE UNIFYING ELEMENT OF GOOD ROCK-'N'-ROLL AND BISCUITS...
 VOLUME!
 BAKED GOODS GET THEIR VOLUME FROM THE LIFT OF HOT AIR,
 OR TO BE MORE EXACT, STEAM AND CARBON DIOXIDE
 THAT'S PRODUCED BY YEAST AND CHEMICAL LEAVENERS.
 NOW AS YOU NO DOUBT REMEMBER
 FROM YOUR FOURTH GRADE SCIENCE CLASS,
 IF YOU COMBINE AN ALKALINE--
 SAY, AH, BAKING SODA--
 WITH AN ACID,
 LIKE VINEGAR, YOU GET...
 WELL, A BIG CASE OF GAS.
 NOW THIS RELATIONSHIP, LIKE MOST, HAS TO BE EQUAL
 IF IT'S REALLY GOING TO WORK.
 AND THAT'S WHAT'S SO GREAT ABOUT BAKING POWDER.
 YOU SEE, IT CONTAINS AN EQUAL RATIO OF AN ACID--
 CREAM OF TARTAR-- AND BAKING SODA.
 ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS ADD LIQUID...
 ♪
 ...AND INSTANT GAS.
 SO WHY DO SO MANY RECIPES CALL FOR
 BOTH BAKING POWDER AND BAKING SODA?
 WELL, IT'S GOT TO DO WITH AN EQUAL RATIO.
 YOU SEE, A LOT OF INGREDIENTS-- CHOCOLATE, SUGAR, EGGS,
 EVEN DAIRY PRODUCTS--
 CAN THROW OFF THE ACID/ ALKALINE RELATIONSHIP.
 SO WE ADD JUST A LITTLE BIT OF BAKING SODA TO OUR BISCUIT DOUGH
 TO HELP COUNTERACT THE ACID IN THE BUTTERMILK.
 EXCUSE ME... HELLO.
 NO, MA MAE, I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING DANGEROUS.
 YES, I'LL TELL THEM... BYE-BYE.
 SHE WANTS ME TO REMIND YOU THAT CHEMICAL LEAVENERS
 HAVE A SPECIFIC SHELF LIFE, SO WATCH THOSE EXPIRATION DATES.
 ONCE YOU'VE GOT BISCUITS DOWN, YOU CAN EXPERIMENT
 WITH ENDLESS VARIATIONS ON THE THEME.
 SCONES START WITH THE SAME DRY MIXTURE AS BISCUITS,
 BUT WITH THE ADDITION OF TWO TABLESPOONS OF SUGAR
 AND AN EXTRA TWO TABLESPOONS OF BUTTER.
 SUBSTITUTE THREE-QUARTERS OF A CUP OF CREAM FOR THE BUTTERMILK,
 AND ADD ONE BEATEN EGG.
 A HANDFUL OF CURRANTS OR DRIED CRANBERRIES
 WOULD BE TRADITIONAL, BUT NOT MANDATORY.
 NOW SHORTCAKE IS EVEN EASIER.
 JUST ADD A THIRD OF A CUP OF SUGAR TO THE DRY MIX,
 AND YOU CAN REPLACE THE BUTTERMILK
 WITH HALF AND HALF, IF YOU WANT,
 BUT I'D MISS THAT BUTTERMILK TWANG.
 IT'S UP TO YOU.
 STIR THE DOUGH UNTIL IT JUST COMES TOGETHER,
 THEN SPOON IT RIGHT OUT ONTO THE PAN.
 BRUSH THOROUGHLY WITH MELTED BUTTER, SPRINKLE WITH SUGAR.
 BAKE AT 400 'TIL GOLDEN, COOL,
 SMOTHER WITH BERRIES AND WHIPPED CREAM,
 EAT, REPEAT.
 ♪
 NOW THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKIN' ABOUT,
 PERFECT, GOLDEN BISCUITS.
 HOW DID YOURS TURN OUT, MA MAE? PERFECT, LIKE ALWAYS.
 SO DID MINE. WHEN DID YOURS GET TO BE PERFECT?
 SO WHAT DO WE PUT ON THE PERFECT SOUTHERN BISCUITS? YOU PUT BUTTER.
 WELL, I DON'T KNOW, WE'VE GOT SOME JAM, SOME PRESERVES,
 SOME SAUSAGE, BACON... WELL, SO WHAT?
 JUST... BUTTER, I'M WITH YA.
 WELL, WE HOPE YOU'VE PICKED UP A FEW POINTERS
 ABOUT THE QUINTESSENTIAL, SOUTHERN QUICKBREAD
 THAT IS THE BISCUIT.
 IT'S POWERFUL MEDICINE, TO BE SURE,
 BUT IT'S WELL WITHIN YOUR REACH.
 JUST REMEMBER, USE SOFT, WINTER-WHEAT, SOUTHERN FLOUR,
 WORK IN THE FAT THOROUGHLY, MIX IT QUICK,
 AND BAKE IT IN A HOT OVEN--AT LEAST 400 DEGREES, RIGHT?
 FOUR-SEVENTY-FIVE. MA MAE, YOUR OVEN HASN'T SEEN 475
 SINCE THE ICE AGE. HONEY, YOU DON'T KNOW A THING ABOUT AN OVEN.
 MY OVEN WILL OUTCOOK YOURS ANY DAY.
 SEE YA NEXT TIME ON "GOOD EATS."
 OVENS, I GOT MORE OVENS IN THE GARAGE THAN YOU'VE EVER HAD IN YOUR LIFE.
 YEAH, BUT YOU DON'T HAVE A GOOD ONE LIKE MINE.
 WHAT'S GOOD ABOUT THAT OVEN, THE THING RUNS ON COAL FUMES!
 IT'S JUST A GOOD ONE, THAT'S ALL I CAN TELL YOU.
 WELL, TRY ONE OF MY BISCUITS, AND YOU'LL HAVE GOOD.
 I DON'T WANT ONE OF YOUR BISCUITS!
 NOBODY'S GONNA EAT THOSE HOCKEY PUCKS!
