 ♪
 WHEN THE NETWORK FIRST ASKED ME TO DO A CHOCOLATE SHOW,
 I SAID, "PIECE OF CAKE."
 AFTER ALL, I'D BEEN AROUND THE SEMISWEET BLOCK A TIME OR TWO.
 FIGURED I'D TALK TO SOME EXPERTS, MAYBE READ A NEW BOOK,
 COME UP WITH A FEW NEW DISHES.
 BUT WHAT WAS A CASUAL INVESTIGATION
 SLOWLY BECAME AN OBSESSION.
 FINALLY, THOUGH, AFTER NIGHTS OF HANGING OUT
 IN SEEDY ON-LINE CHOCOLATE CHAT ROOMS,
 I FINALLY GOT A SOLID LEAD
 IN THE FORM OF A CRYPTIC E-MAIL FROM SOMEONE NAMED W.J.W.
 WHOEVER THEY ARE, THEY MEANT FOR ME TO COME ALONE.
 ♪
 SEEMS THAT, LIKE A LOT OF OLD STORIES,
 THE STORY OF CHOCOLATE STARTS WITH A TREE.
 SO... THEOBROMA CACAO.
 (Stranger) FOOD OF THE GODS.
 (Alton) WHEN THE STRANGER FINALLY SHOWED UP,
 HE WAS, WELL, PRETTY STRANGE.
 YEAH, SUPPOSEDLY A GIFT TO DAMIA
 FROM THE GOD QUETZALCOATL. WHO THEN DISAPPEARED INTO THE OCEAN.
 YEAH, BUT NOT BEFORE PROMISING TO RETURN.
 WHICH IS WHY THE AZTECS MISTOOK CORTEZ FOR A GOD
 AND GAVE HIM ALL THEIR CHOCOLATE.
 YEAH, JUST BEFORE HE WIPED OUT THEIR CIVILIZATION.
 SAY, WHO ARE YOU, ANYWAY?
 THE CACAOS ARE CONCHIFEROUS, YOU KNOW.
 THE FRUIT GROWS STRAIGHT FROM THE TRUNK
 AND STAYS IN FRUIT FROM THE TIME THEY'RE FIVE
 WELL INTO THEIR THIRTIES.
 IF OF COURSE, THE MIDGE POPULATION STAYS HEALTHY.
 MIDGE? MIDGE WHO?
 LITTLE FLIES... THE SOLE POLLINATOR OF THE CACAO.
 GO AHEAD... TAKE ONE.
 THE POD LOOKED AND FELT LIKE A PETRIFIED NERF FOOTBALL.
 EACH POD TAKES FIVE TO SIX MONTHS TO RIPEN.
 AND IT WAS EVEN UGLIER ON THE INSIDE.
 SWEET... BUT THAT AIN'T CHOCOLATE.
 ANIMALS AND EARLY MAN CAME FOR THE PULP.
 NOBODY REALLY KNOWS WHO FIGURED OUT
 THAT THE REAL MAGIC LAY IN THE SEEDS. I DON'T KNOW.
 I'D SURE LIKE TO SEE THIS TURN INTO THIS.
 OH, WOULD YOU, NOW?
 WELL, THEN YOU SHOULD MEET SOME FRIENDS OF MINE...
 PART OF THE CHOCOLATE UNDERGROUND, YOU MIGHT SAY.
 SAN FRANCISCO?
 I THINK YOU'LL FIND THEIR CHOCOLATES TO BE,
 HOW SHALL I SAY, "GOOD EATS."
 HEY, WHAT THE DEVIL!
 DRIVEN, AS IF BY A '67 MUSTANG CONVERTIBLE,
 I HEADED WEST
 TO SCHARFFEN BERGER CHOCOLATE, AND A REALLY BIG BRIDGE.
 I GOT TO SCHARFFEN BERGER CHOCOLATE
 JUST IN TIME TO CATCH ONE OF THE OWNERS,
 ROBERT STEINBERG, CHECK ON A ROASTING BATCH
 OF CAREFULLY BLENDED BEANS FROM AROUND THE WORLD.
 IT WAS HARD TO BELIEVE THE ALIEN POD I HELD THREE TIME ZONES AGO
 HAD YIELDED THESE FRAGRANT JEWELS.
 AS WE WATCHED THE VINTAGE GERMAN ROASTER COOL BEANS,
 STEINBERG EXPLAINED THAT ROASTING IS WHERE THE MAGIC
 OF REAL CHOCOLATE HAPPENS--
 DON'T ROAST FAR ENOUGH,
 AND THE CHOCOLATE WILL BE BLAND AND TWO-DIMENSIONAL.
 GO TOO FAR, AND IT'S TOAST.
 JUST RIGHT IS A NARROW RIVER OF JOY THAT RUNS BETWEEN THE TWO.
 FROM THERE THE WINNOWING MACHINE
 LITERALLY SHOOK THE OUTER SHELL OFF THE SEED,
 REVEALING THE NIB INSIDE.
 THEN CAME THE MELANGéUR, WHICH GETS MEDIEVAL ON THE NIBS
 BY GRINDING THEM WITH COARSE SUGAR
 UNDER THE WEIGHT OF TWO GRANITE WHEELS.
 AS THE COCOA BUTTER INSIDE THE NIBS
 COMBINED WITH THE COCOA SOLIDS,
 WHAT STARTED AS BROWN GRAVEL BECAME A GLISTENING, SMOOTH PASTE.
 THIS IS WHAT CHOCOLATE INSIDERS CALL COCOA LIQUOR.
 IT DOESN'T CONTAIN ALCOHOL,
 BUT IF A CHOCOLATE BAR WAS A COCKTAIL,
 THIS STUFF WOULD BE THE BOOZE.
 STEINBERG EXPLAINED THAT DIFFERENT CHOCOLATES
 HAVE DIFFERENT PERCENTAGES OF COCOA LIQUOR,
 FROM BITTER CHOCOLATE, WHICH CAN HAVE AS MUCH AS 98% OF THE STUFF,
 DOWN TO MILK CHOCOLATE, WHICH MAY HAVE AS LITTLE AS 10%.
 WHITE CHOCOLATE CONTAINS COCOA BUTTER,
 BUT NO CHOCOLATE SOLIDS AT ALL.
 NEXT CAME CONCHING,
 A MIXING AND HEATING THAT DRIVES OFF BITTER COMPOUNDS
 AND SMOOTHES THE CHOCOLATE OUT TO A VELVETY ELIXIR OF LOVE.
 THE CONCHING PROCESS CAN LAST A DAY OR MORE ON GOOD CHOCOLATES.
 ANY CHOCOLATE THAT ENDS UP IN BAR FORM HAS TO BE TEMPERED,
 OR HEATED AND COOLED, UNTIL ALL THE DIFFERENT FATS
 KIND OF SYNCHRONIZE THEIR MELTING POINTS.
 SKIP THIS, AND THE CHOCOLATE WILL NEVER SET
 INTO A SHINY, SNAPPY BAR.
 THEN STEINBERG SHOWED ME THE SECRET TO SCHARFFEN BERGER'S SUCCESS...
 BEANS, LOTS OF BEANS.
 BUT WHY WOULD HE SAVE THE BEGINNING FOR THE END?
 BECAUSE THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE PROCESS.
 THIS IS WHERE WE KEEP THE BEANS
 THAT GO INTO THE CHOCOLATE.
 AND WITHOUT THE BEANS, WITHOUT GOOD BEANS,
 YOU CAN'T MAKE GOOD CHOCOLATE.
 SO THIS IS REALLY THE SECRET, THEN, HUH?
 IN A SENSE, IT IS.
 I MEAN, PEOPLE WHO MAKE CHOCOLATE
 ARE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT PROTECTING THEIR SOURCES OF BEANS.
 AND WE'RE USING BEANS FROM A LOT OF DIFFERENT PLACES.
 HOW MANY DIFFERENT PLACES?
 I THINK FIVE OR SIX DIFFERENT COUNTRIES.
 BUT EVEN WITHIN AN INDIVIDUAL COUNTRY,
 THE BEANS MAY VARY FROM ONE FARM TO ANOTHER.
 SO IN A WAY THIS IS KIND OF LIKE COFFEE BEANS,
 THE WAY PEOPLE ROAST AND BLEND COFFEE?
 I DON'T THINK THEY'RE TASTED AS MUCH
 IN THE PROCESS OF ROASTING AS COCOA BEANS ARE.
 YOU BASICALLY DECIDE WHICH ONES YOU'RE GOING TO USE.
 AND YOU CREATE A BLEND AND THEN YOU TASTE THEM
 AND THEN PROBABLY GO BACK WITH COFFEE.
 ONCE WE'VE DECIDED ON BEANS, WE THEN ROAST BY VARIETY.
 AND WE CHECK THE BEANS,
 I WOULD SAY, AS MANY AS FIVE OF SIX OR PERHAPS AS MANY AS TEN TIMES
 IN THE LAST FEW MINUTES OF ROASTING,
 TO DETERMINE WHEN THEY'RE DONE.
 BECAUSE THERE REALLY IS A MOMENT WHEN THEY TASTE KIND OF FLAT,
 AND THEN A MOMENT WHEN THEY'RE OVERDONE.
 IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT IS THE TIME WHEN THEY'RE DONE,
 AND THEY HAVE THIS INCREDIBLE SWEETNESS THAT COMES OUT.
 SO IT HAPPENS VERY, VERY SLOWLY,
 AND THEN IT HAPPENS VERY, VERY QUICKLY. RIGHT.
 TO ME IT'S LIKE BROILING FISH,
 WHERE ONE MOMENT IT'S WAY UNDERDONE,
 THE NEXT MOMENT IT'S COMPLETELY DRY AND OVERCOOKED.
 AND THEN THERE'S A POINT IN THE MIDDLE WHEN IT TASTES GOOD.
 (Alton) SPEAKING OF SHINNY, SNAPPY BARS, I'D HAD ABOUT A DOZEN OF THEM
 AND WAS FEELING A LITTLE, WELL, QUEASY.
 SO I DECIDED TO DROP BY MY DOCTOR'S.
 (Alton) HMM... CHOCOLATE EASTER BUNNY.
 VERY INTERESTING. OH, COME ON, DOC!
 GIVE IT TO ME STRAIGHT... HAVE I OD'd OR NOT?
 WELL, CHOCOLATE CONTAINS MANY THINGS.
 APART FROM THE STIMULANTS, CAFFEINE, AND THEOBROMINE,
 THERE IS THE PHENYLETHYLAMINE, THE LOVE HORMONE.
 CHOCOLATE éCLAIR... LOVE HORMONE?
 YEAH, COMBINES WITH DOPAMINE--STRONG STUFF.
 AND THEN THERE IS THE ENENDOMINE.
 AN... AN... ANACONDA? WORKS ON THE BRAIN LIKE SOME NARCOTICS.
 NARCOTIC, HUH?
 HOW MUCH OF THAT WOULD I HAVE TO EAT?
 ABOUT 25 POUNDS.
 A CHOCOLATE SANTA.
 IN A YEAR? OH... NO!
 IN ABOUT ONE SITTING.
 OH, WELL, I GUESS MY BRAIN CHECKS OUT, THEN.
 BUT DOC, WHAT ABOUT MY BODY?
 LET'S GET THIS IN PERSPECTIVE.
 COCOA BUTTER CONTAINS STEARIC ACIDS,
 AND STEARIC ACIDS DON'T RAISE YOUR SERUM CHOLESTEROL.
 IT HAS PHENOLS IN IT, AND PHENOLS ARE ANTIOXIDANTS.
 ANTIOXIDANTS ARE GOOD FOR YOUR HEART,
 AND THEY ALSO DECREASE YOUR RISK OF CANCER.
 ONE OUNCE OF COCOA HAS LESS CAFFEINE THAN AN ENTIRE CUP OF DECAF.
 IT DOESN'T CAUSE ACNE.
 IT INCREASES ENERGY, SO IT'S NOT THAT BAD.
 AND WHO MIGHT YOU BE?
 I'M A NUTRITIONIST. YEAH, SHE SHARES THE OFFICE... WE CARPOOL.
 NOW OF COURSE, DOC, IT COULD DILATE HIS BLOOD VESSELS,
 SO HE MAY GET SOME MORE HEADACHES.
 YA, YA, BUT IT'S A...
 IT LOOKS LIKE A MOOSE.
 LOOKS LIKE A BEAUTIFUL CHOCOLATE MOOSE.
 THAT'S IT! WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF IT?
 I MEAN WHAT COULD BE EASIER?
 WHAT COULD BE MORE DELICIOUS? CHOCOLATE MOUSSE!
 UM... DOCS... SORRY, OUR TIME'S UP FOR THIS WEEK, OKAY?
 BYE.
 ♪
 MOUSSE... THAT'S FRENCH FOR FROTH,
 WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT IT IS.
 WHEN IT'S GOOD, IT'S LIGHT... IT'S AIRY,
 IT'S MELT IN YOUR MOUTH.
 AND IT ONLY TAKES A HANDFUL OF INGREDIENTS,
 AND TWO TECHNIQUES,
 WHICH ARE THE BASIC KNOTS OF THE DESSERT WORLD--
 WHIPPING CREAM AND MELTING CHOCOLATE.
 NOW ANYBODY WHO'S TRIED MELTING CHOCOLATE
 HAS PROBABLY RUN INTO THOSE TWIN SPECTERS, SEIZING AND BURNING.
 AND WHEN CHOCOLATE BURNS,
 THE COCOA BUTTER LITERALLY RUNS OUT,
 AND THE SOLIDS KIND OF COAGULATE.
 IT'S UGLY... IT'S INOPERABLE,
 AND IT HAPPENS AT A VERY LOW TEMPERATURE--
 AS LOW AS 130 .
 NOW THIS LEADS US TO LAW NUMBER ONE OF CHOCOLATE MELTING--
 START SMALL.
 NOW THAT THERE ARE QUALITY CHOCOLATE CHIPS ON THE MARKET,
 THEY'RE A GREAT PLACE TO START.
 THEY ARE LITTLE... THEY'RE UNIFORMLY SHAPED.
 AND WE'RE GOING TO USE ABOUT 12 OUNCES OF THEM
 FOR OUR MOUSSE,
 WHICH LEADS US TO THE SECOND LAW--
 GO SLOW.
 I LIKE TO USE A SIMPLE DOUBLE BOILER.
 IT'S JUST A STAINLESS STEEL BOWL OVER SIMMERING WATER.
 NOW THERE ARE COOKS OUT THERE
 WHO SWEAR BY THE MICROWAVE OR THE OVEN.
 NOW I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,
 BUT I CAN'T STIR CHOCOLATE FROM INSIDE A MICROWAVE.
 AND STIR YOU MUST...
 IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO EVENLY DISTRIBUTE THE HEAT.
 IF YOU DON'T HAVE CHIPS, DON'T WORRY.
 YOU CAN USE BAR OR BLOCK CHOCOLATE.
 BUT CHOP IT UP AS FINE AS YOU CAN
 WITH A HEAVY KNIFE BEFOREHAND.
 NOW THIS IS USUALLY WHEN I ADD A LITTLE BIT OF SALT.
 CHOCOLATE LOVES A LITTLE SALT.
 NOW THIS MAY BE A GREAT METHOD,
 BUT IT DOES LEAD US TO THE DANGER OF BREAKING
 RULE NUMBER THREE, WHICH IS...
 DON'T GET IT WET. DOOOHHHHHH!!!!
 NOW IF ONE DROP OF WATER
 CAN TURN A WHOLE POT OF CHOCOLATE INTO CHERNOBYL,
 THEN WHY IS IT THERE ARE SO MANY CHOCOLATE RECIPES
 THAT HAVE LIQUID IN THEM,
 OURS INCLUDED?
 WELL, LUCKILY IN MY LINE OF WORK,
 THERE ARE ALWAYS FOOD SCIENTISTS DROPPING BY AND HANGING AROUND.
 SO... SHIRLEY, WHAT'S THE DEAL?
 WHAT HAPPENED TO MY CHOCOLATE?
 IT'S CALLED SEIZING,
 AND IT HAPPENS WHEN YOU'VE GOT DRY, DRY PARTICLES,
 AND THAT'S WHAT WE'VE GOT IN CHOCOLATE...
 DRY, DRY PARTICLES IN THIS RICH, RICH FAT COCOA BUTTER.
 A TINY BIT OF MOISTURE GLUES THESE DRY PARTICLES TOGETHER.
 LET ME JUST SHOW YOU WITH THE SUGAR HERE.
 IF YOU PUT A LOT OF WATER IN... IT DISSOLVES... NO LUMPS.
 BUT IF YOU TAKE YOUR SPOON, YOU STIRRED YOUR COFFEE,
 AND HAVE JUST A LITTLE WATER, LOOK AT ALL THESE CLUMPS.
 SO HOW DO I FIX IT?
 MORE LIQUID. OKAY.
 AND IT WILL ALL BE ALL RIGHT.
 WE'VE GOT...
 SO IS THAT GOING TO DO IT?
 IS THAT ENOUGH? OH, YES, YOUR MAGIC AMOUNT IS...
 AND THAT WILL BE ENOUGH TO WET EVERYBODY DOWN
 AND PREVENT SEIZING.
 THIS IS WHY HAVING YOUR OWN KITCHEN SCIENTIST
 IS THE BEST ACCESSORY MONEY CAN BUY.
 WELL, WHAT DO YOU KNOW, SHE WAS RIGHT.
 WE'RE SMOOTH AGAIN.
 OF COURSE, IF WE HAD MELTED ALL OF THESE INGREDIENTS TOGETHER IN THE FIRST PLACE,
 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SMOOTH ALL ALONG,
 AND THIS ALL WOULD HAVE HAPPENED A LOT FASTER.
 WE CAN GO AHEAD AND TAKE THIS OFF THE HEAT.
 THE FEW CHUNKS THAT ARE STILL THERE
 WILL MELT WITH AN OCCASIONAL WALK-BY STIR.
 WE NEED TO LET THIS COOL DOWN
 TO JUST ABOVE BODY TEMPERATURE, ANYWAY, SO LEAVE IT ALONE.
 NEXT UP... THE CREAM.
 ♪
 NOW A GOOD MOUSSE RULE OF THUMB
 IS TO USE THE SAME AMOUNT OF WHIPPING CREAM AS CHOCOLATE.
 AND SINCE A PINT'S A POUND THE WORLD AROUND,
 THAT MEANS...
 NOW POUR OFF A COUPLE OF OUNCES OF THIS
 INTO A METAL MEASURING CUP AND REFRIGERATE THE REST.
 OKAY, IF THERE WERE A TRICK TO CHOCOLATE MOUSSE,
 AND I'M NOT SAYING THERE IS,
 BUT IF THERE WERE, IT WOULD BE POWERED GELATIN.
 ODDS ARE YOU'VE NEVER PONDERED THIS STUFF IN THE STORE.
 WHY WOULD YOU?
 IT'S FLAVORLESS, COLORLESS, ODORLESS.
 IT'S A VERITABLE NINJA.
 BUT WHAT IT DOES IS BIND MOISTURE,
 WHICH, IF YOU'RE CHOCOLATE MOUSSE, IS A PRETTY COOL THING.
 TAKE ABOUT A TEASPOON.
 NOW BEFORE THIS CAN BE DISSOLVED,
 IT HAS TO BLOOM OR SOAK IN COLD LIQUID, LIKE CREAM.
 IT'LL TAKE MAYBE TEN MINUTES.
 JUST FORGET IT'S HERE.
 BESIDES, WHIPPIN' TIME'S HERE.
 YOU'RE GOING TO NEED THE REMAINDER OF THE COLD WHIPPING CREAM,
 A DECENT MIXER--I LIKE A HAND-HELD MODEL--
 AND A STAINLESS STEEL OR COPPER BOWL...
 NO GLASS OR PLASTIC.
 AND ANYTHING THAT COMES IN CONTACT WITH THE CREAM
 NEEDS TO BE CHILLED THOROUGHLY--
 IN THE FREEZER, PLEASE!
 WHY BOTHER WITH THIS?
 WELL, THE ANSWER, MY FRIEND, IS FLOATING IN THE CREAM.
 IT'S ALL ABOUT FAT AND AIR.
 SEE, WHEN YOU START WHIPPING CREAM,
 YOU'RE MAINLY, WELL, BLOWING BUBBLES.
 YOU DO THIS ON A LOW SETTING,
 JUST TO KIND OF GET THINGS FROTHY...
 NOT TOO FAST,
 JUST ENOUGH TO GET SOME BUBBLES WORKED IN.
 TAKE YOUR TIME.
 AS SOON AS YOU GET A GOOD... WELL,
 KIND OF A MR. BUBBLE BATH THING GOING, GIVE IT THE GAS.
 THIS IS A NEWLY FORMED BUBBLE INSIDE WHIPPED CREAM.
 WE'VE GOT AIR IN THE MIDDLE, WALLS OF WATER,
 AND THESE LITTLE BLUE GUYS ARE FAT GLOBULES
 JUST KIND OF HANGING AROUND THE BORDER.
 NOW THE MORE AIR YOU WHIP INTO THE CREAM,
 THE MORE BUBBLES YOU MAKE.
 BUT THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH WATER TO GO AROUND.
 SO THESE BUBBLES GET SMALLER, AND SMALLER, AND SMALLER,
 UNTIL EVENTUALLY, THESE BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF BUBBLES
 ARE SO SMALL THAT BINGO! THEIR FAT GLOBULES TOUCH,
 AND YOU'VE GOT STABLE WHIPPED CREAM
 SUITABLE FOR ANY DESSERT TOPPING OR EVEN FROSTING A CAKE.
 NOW IF YOU KEEP WHIPPING THIS,
 THE LITTLE FATS WILL EVENTUALLY SQUEEZE OUT
 ALL WATER AND ALL THE AIR, AND YOU WILL HAVE MADE BUTTER.
 THIS IS A VERY GOOD SKILL IF YOU LIVE IN THE "LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE,"
 BUT FOR MAKING CHOCOLATE MOUSSE, IT'S NOT THAT VALUABLE.
 NOW SINCE THIS STRUCTURE DEPENDS ON FAT,
 WE WANT TO DO ALL WE CAN TO KEEP THAT FAT FROM MELTING.
 THAT'S WHY THE CHILLED BOWL AND BEATERS.
 NOW WE'VE GOT MEDIUM PEAKS, WHICH IS GOOD.
 WE COULD GO ALL THE WAY TO STIFF PEAKS,
 BUT THEN THE CREAM WOULD LOSE ALL OF ITS ELASTICITY,
 AND WE'RE GOING TO NEED THAT ELASTICITY WHEN WE FOLD THIS IN LATER.
 NOW RIGHT NOW THIS IS A STABLE, THICK CREAM.
 AND ADDING THE GELATIN INTO THE CHOCOLATE
 IS GOING TO KEEP IT THAT WAY.
 SEE, WITHOUT SOME KIND OF STABILIZER,
 EVENTUALLY PHYSICS WOULD WIN
 AND THE WATER TRAPPED IN OUR WHIPPED CREAM, WOULD WEEP OUT,
 WHICH WOULD WRECK OUR MOUSSE.
 ENTER THE GELATIN.
 THAT LITTLE TEASPOON WILL STABILIZE ALL THAT WATER,
 BUT IT HAS TO BE DISSOLVED FIRST,
 WHICH YOU CAN DO OVER DIRECT HEAT.
 JUST KEEP MOVING IT AROUND UNTIL YOU DON'T SEE ANY MORE GRAIN.
 BE CAREFUL NOT TO BOIL IT,
 BECAUSE THAT WOULD DAMAGE THE GELATIN.
 OKAY, CHOCOLATE IS STILL AT A GOOD TEMPERATURE,
 SO WE'RE GOING TO JUST POUR THE GELATIN MIXTURE IN
 AND STIR.
 NOW YOU GOT TO KNOW WHEN TO HOLD 'EM AND WHEN TO FOLD 'EM.
 AND NOW IT'S TIME TO FOLD 'EM.
 BRINGING THESE TWO KIDS TOGETHER
 IS KIND OF LIKE A CULINARY BLIND DATE.
 IT COULD BE MAGIC, OR IT COULD BE DISASTER... WHY?
 WELL, WE'VE GOT LIGHT, FLUFFY, AIRY ON THIS SIDE,
 DARK, DENSE, STICKY ON THIS SIDE.
 SO BEFORE WE BRING THEM TOGETHER IN CULINARY MATRIMONY,
 WE'RE GOING TO LIGHTEN UP THE CHOCOLATE MIXTURE
 WITH A LITTLE BIT OF THE CREAM,
 JUST SO THAT THEY'RE MORE ALIKE IN TEXTURE.
 SO WE'RE GOING TO ADD ABOUT A QUARTER OF THE CREAM,
 AND JUST STIR IT INTO THE CHOCOLATE,
 JUST TO LIGHTEN IT A LITTLE BIT.
 NOW WE'RE GOING TO FOLD IN HALF OF THE WHIPPED CREAM.
 JUST SPLIT IT DOWN THE MIDDLE AND FOLD IT IN.
 NOW HERE'S THE TRICK.
 WE'RE NOT GOING TO STIR... WE'RE GOING TO FOLD
 WITH THE SPATULA DOWN, UP AND OVER.
 IT'S JUST TURNING OVER THE MIXTURE, LITERALLY.
 CUT INTO THE MIDDLE AND OVER.
 YOU'RE NOT REALLY WORRIED ABOUT GETTING IT FULLY INTEGRATED RIGHT NOW.
 THE BEST MOUSSES I'VE EVER HAD
 HAVE HAD LITTLE STREAKS OF CREAM IN THEM,
 LITTLE STREAKS OF CHOCOLATE.
 THE MAIN THINGS IS WE DON'T WANT TO OVERDO IT,
 'CAUSE IF WE DO, WE'RE GOING TO BEAT ALL THE AIR
 OUT OF THE WHIPPED CREAM, WHICH IS NOT WHAT WE WANT.
 THAT'S ENOUGH... NOW GO AHEAD AND ADD THE REST OF THE CREAM,
 AND REPEAT... JUST FOLD OVER.
 TURN AND FOLD.
 THIS IS, BY THE WAY, THE EXACT SAME PROCEDURE YOU WOULD USE
 FOR BUILDING A SOUFFLé,
 A SOUFFLé OMELET, OR GOSH, ANY OF ABOUT 50 MERINGUE DESSERTS
 THAT HAVE THIS SAME PROCEDURE.
 SO IF YOU CAN GET THIS ONE DOWN,
 IT'S A REALLY, REALLY GREAT TECHNIQUE TO HAVE--
 A BASIC.
 NOW WE'RE ALMOST THERE.
 THE OVERALL COLOR'S GOOD... IT'S STILL LIGHT AND FLUFFY.
 AND LIKE I SAID,
 I DON'T CARE IF I'VE GOT A FEW FLECKS OF WHITE.
 WE'RE THERE.
 NOW IF YOU'RE ANYTHING LIKE ME,
 YOU'D LET THIS WHOLE THING SET FOR MAYBE AN HOUR,
 AND THEN YOU'D EAT IT.
 OR YOU COULD SHUN THE BINGE AND SPOON IT INTO MARTINI GLASSES--
 ADMITTEDLY A BETTER SINGLE SERVING.
 NOW JUST PUT THESE INTO THE REFRIGERATOR FOR ABOUT AN HOUR
 UNTIL THE MOUSSE SETS, THEN TAKE THEM OUT,
 PUT SOME PLASTIC WRAP OVER THEM, AND REFRIGERATE THEM AGAIN.
 THE PLASTIC WRAP WILL MAKE SURE THAT THE FAT IN THE CHOCOLATE
 DOESN'T PICK UP ANY FUNNY FLAVORS,
 LIKE, OH, SAY, GARLIC OR FISH.
 THEN AGAIN, YOU COULD JUST EAT IT ALL.
 ♪
 I WOULD HAVE STOPPED WITH THE MOUSSE
 IF IT HADN'T OF BEEN FOR AN UNEXPECTED PIECE OF AIRMAIL.
 HEY WHAT IS THIS, SOME KIND OF GOLDEN TICKET?
 WONKA... HUH!
 HEY, SOME KIND OF RECIPE.
 WAIT A MINUTE... THE GUY AT THE BOTANICAL GARDENS...
 YOU DON'T THINK...
 SURE ENOUGH, WILLIAM JEFFERSON WONKA.
 I BETTER GET COOKING!
 I RUSHED TO THE KITCHEN TO ASSEMBLE THE MYSTERIOUS RECIPE.
 AFTER PREHEATING THE OVEN TO 375 ,
 I SET UP A DOUBLE BOILER
 AND MELTED EIGHT OUNCES OF CHOCOLATE AND ONE STICK OF BUTTER.
 SINCE IT'S ABOUT 18% WATER,
 THE BUTTER WOULD PROVIDE ENOUGH LIQUID TO KEEP THE CHOCOLATE FROM SEIZING.
 TO ROUND OUT THE FLAVOR, I ADDED A TEASPOON OF VANILLA EXTRACT.
 WHAT THE HECK, WONKA WOULD NEVER KNOW.
 I LOADED UP MY SNUB-NOSED HAND MIXER,
 GATHERED THE REST OF THE HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE
 I KNEW I'D NEED,
 AND THEN SETTLED DOWN TO FIGURE OUT WHAT I WAS CONCOCTING.
 A HALF A CUP OF SUGAR WOULD ADD SWEETNESS AND KEEP THE CAKES MOIST.
 A TABLESPOON OF NATURAL COCOA PROMISED DEEP-CHOCOLATE FLAVOR.
 A MEASLY FOUR TABLESPOONS OF ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR
 WOULD PROVIDE SOME STRUCTURE, BUT BOY HOWDY,
 THESE SUCKERS WERE GOING TO BE DENSE.
 WISELY, A QUARTER TEASPOON OF SALT WAS CALLED FOR
 TO HIGHLIGHT THE OTHER FLAVORS.
 SO FAR, SO GOOD.
 I TOOK THE CHOCOLATE OFF THE HEAT AND SMOOTHED IT OUT
 WITH THE KITCHENAIDE SET TO "STUN."
 NEXT CAME FOUR EGGS,
 EACH ONE FULLY INCORPORATED BEFORE THE NEXT ONE TOOK THE DIVE.
 YOLKS WOULD ADD RICHNESS, AND WHITES WOULD LEAVEN
 BY HOLDING ON TO AIR, JUST LIKE A SOUFFLé.
 FINALLY, I SIFTED IN THE DRY STUFF, JUST A LITTLE AT A TIME.
 NO LUMPS TODAY, THANKS.
 ALL THAT WAS MISSING NOW WAS THE AIR.
 SO I OPENED UP THE MIXER AND GAVE THE BATTER WHAT IT NEEDED--
 A GOOD BEATING!
 FIVE MINUTES LATER, IT WAS RIGHT WHERE I WANTED IT--
 LIGHT, CREAMY, AND THICK.
 I LET THE BATTER CHILL, AND TURNED MY ATTENTION TO THE MUFFIN TIN.
 I BUTTERED THE CUPS,
 USING MY FAVORITE BUTTER-IN-THE-BAG TRICK.
 THEN I SPRINKLED ON A HEFTY LOAD OF COCOA POWDER
 AND SPREAD IT AROUND.
 I FIGURED A DISHER WOULD MAKE FAST WORK OF THAT STICKY BATTER,
 AND I PICKED OUT A NICE FOUR-OUNCER
 SO THE NICE LITTLE CAKES WOULD HAVE PLENTY OF ROOM TO RISE.
 I SET MY TIMER FOR TEN MINUTES AND MADE A SAUCE, JUST IN CASE--
 NOTHING FANCY, JUST A CUP OF VANILLA ICE CREAM
 MELTED OVER LOW HEAT AND A TEASPOON OF INSTANT ESPRESSO POWDER.
 CHEAP TRICK, BUT IT WORKS EVERY TIME.
 ♪
 HMM, CRUSTY SIDES, WOBBLY CENTERS... PERFECT.
 IT WAS TIME TO FACE THE MUFFIN.
 THE CRUST SOON YIELDED TO MY SPOON'S ADVANCES,
 REVEALING A SOFT, OOZING, LAVA FLOW OF LOVE INSIDE.
 HAD I FINALLY FOUND WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR?
 I WAS HOME, AND I DIDN'T HAVE TO SHARE WITH ANYBODY.
 ♪
 SO OUR STORY ENDS AS IT BEGAN--
 MAN ALONE WITH HIS CHOCOLATE.
 I NEVER SAW THAT WONKA FELLA AGAIN,
 BUT I WAS THANKFUL FOR WHAT HE'D GIVEN ME--
 AN EASY, TOP-NOTCH CHOCOLATE FIX,
 OUT OF THE OVEN IN A QUARTER HOUR.
 I CLOSE WITH WISE WORDS FROM LUCY VAN PELT, OF "PEANUTS" FAME.
 "ALL YOU REALLY NEED IS LOVE,
 BUT A LITTLE CHOCOLATE NOW AND THEN DOESN'T HURT."
