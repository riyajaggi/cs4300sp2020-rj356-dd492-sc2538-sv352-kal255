 THE STORY OF THE POTATO IS A TALE OF EPIC PROPORTION.
 THE MOST IMPORTANT FOOD CROP ON EARTH,
 POTATO IS ADORED NOWHERE MORE THAN IT IS IN AMERICA.
 EVEN HERE AT THIS DINER,
 THEY SERVE IT MAYBE EIGHT, NINE DIFFERENT WAYS.
 THEY LIKE TO BE SHREDDED, SAUTéED, SCALLOPED,
 BAKED AND BOILED, MASHED AND WHIPPED,
 GRILLED, ROASTED AND FRIED...
 SOUNDS KIND OF LIKE THE LAST FIVE MINUTES OF "BRAVEHEART."
 AS FOR THESE LITTLE GUYS,
 I'M WILLING TO BET YOU THAT THERE IS AT LEAST ONE
 UNDER YOUR CAR SEAT RIGHT NOW.
 DON'T BELIEVE ME? TAKE A LOOK.
 THIS IS "GOOD EATS,"
 AND TODAY WE'RE GOING TO BE TAKING A CLOSER LOOK AT A FOOD
 THAT MOST OF US TAKE, AT LEAST A LITTLE, FOR GRANTED--
 THE HUMBLE POTATO.
 ♪
 NOW IF YOU WERE GOING TO MAKE A POTATO MOVIE,
 IT WOULD HAVE TO BE A ROAD PICTURE,
 BECAUSE THAT HUMBLE TUBER'S CROSSED A LOT OF TIME AND SPACE
 TO GET UNDER YOUR CAR SEAT.
 THE SPANISH CONQUISTADORS FIRST SCOOPED IT FROM ITS NATIVE SOIL
 BACK WHEN THEY WERE PLUNDERING CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA.
 NOW THEY TOOK IT HOME TO A VERY COOL RECEPTION IN EUROPE,
 EXCEPT FOR THE IRISH.
 THE IRISH KNEW A GOOD THING WHEN THEY SAW IT,
 AND BY THE 17th CENTURY HAD PLANTED THEIR ISLAND
 WALL TO FENCE WITH POTATOES.
 NOW THE REST OF EUROPE WAS ABOUT 100 YEARS BEHIND,
 BECAUSE FOR SOME REASON THE FRENCH AND THE ITALIANS
 THOUGHT IT WAS POISON.
 NOW I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND ALL OF THIS,
 BUT THEN I'M NOT A NUTRITIONAL ANTHROPOLOGIST,
 BUT YOU ARE. YES, I AM.
 OKAY, WHY DID THE FRENCH AND ITALIANS
 THINK THE POTATO WAS POISON?
 BECAUSE IT IS. OH!
 THE POTATO PLANT IS A POISONOUS PLANT,
 ALL PARTS OF THE PLANT--
 THE LEAVES, THE STEMS, THE FLOWERS, THE ROOTS,
 AND EVEN THE POTATO, IN THE WILD, ARE POISONOUS.
 AND IT'S TO THE CREDIT OF THE INCAS, WHO DOMESTICATED IT,
 THAT THEY WERE BRILLIANT BIOCHEMISTS,
 BECAUSE THEY WERE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT
 HOW TO GROW A POTATO WITHOUT POISON IN IT. WOW!
 SO WHAT'S THE CONNECTION TO THE EUROPEANS?
 WELL, ONCE IT GOT TO EUROPE,
 THE EUROPEANS RECOGNIZED IT AS BEING SIMILAR TO DEADLY NIGHTSHADES
 THAT THEY HAD BEEN GROWING FOR YEARS,
 AND USING TO POISON KINGS, NOBLES,
 FAMILY MEMBERS AND OTHER UNDESIRABLES.
 GET OUT! IT'S TRUE.
 NOW WHAT PLANT WOULD WE KNOW THAT'S IN THAT SAME FAMILY?
 BELL PEPPERS, EGGPLANT, TOBACCO, TOMATOES...
 THEY'RE ALL OTHER MEMBERS OF THE NIGHTSHADE FAMILY. ANYTHING THAT GROWS AROUND HERE?
 ACTUALLY THE FIELD THAT WE'RE WALKING NEXT TO IS FULL OF NIGHTSHADES--
 THE POISON VARIETIES. WOW!
 SO YOU EAT POTATOES? SURE, I LOVE POTATOES.
 HOW DO YOU LIKE 'EM? I LIKE 'EM BOILED WITH A LITTLE BUTTER AND A LOT OF PARSLEY.
 ALWAYS A FAVORITE.
 UNFORTUNATELY, THE IRISH DIDN'T COVER THEIR BETS,
 AND A MID-19th-CENTURY BLIGHT WIPED OUT FOUR YEARS OF CROP,
 LEAVING ABOUT A MILLION DEAD AND ANOTHER MILLION SAILING FOR AMERICA
 WHERE THE POTATO HAD ALREADY PROVEN ITS ROADWORTHINESS.
 IT WAS THE PERFECT PIONEER CHOW--
 TRANSPORTABLE, STORABLE, NUTRITIOUS,
 AND IT WOULD GROW OUT OF JUST ABOUT ANY HOLE YOU DROPPED IT IN.
 NOW EVEN TODAY WE STILL ASSOCIATE OUR FAVORITE POTATO DISHES
 WITH ROADSIDE STANDS, JUKE JOINTS AND TRUCK STOPS.
 I MEAN, THINK ABOUT IT...
 MASHED POTATOES, HOME FRIES, HASH BROWNS...
 ROAD FOOD!
 NOW IT USED TO BE EASY TO BUY POTATOES.
 I MEAN AFTER ALL, THERE ARE ONLY THREE VARIETIES.
 I MEAN, THERE WERE THE ONES THAT LOOKED LIKE MR. POTATO HEAD,
 THE RED ONES AND SOME KIND OF WHITE ONES.
 BUT NOW A FEW YEARS AGO FARMERS AND GROCERS STARTED TO UP THE ANTE
 BY BRINGING AN EVER- WIDENING ARRAY OF NEW POTATOES TO THE BINS.
 AND THEN WE WERE FACED WITH A QUANDARY...
 HOW DO YOU COOK ALL THOSE POTATOES?
 HOW DO YOU LIKE 'EM?
 YEAH... THOSE ARE TASTY!
 I THINK IT WAS SHAKESPEARE WHO POSED THE QUESTION...
 "WHAT'S IN A NAME?"
 WELL, IF HE WAS TALKING ABOUT AMERICAN POTATOES,
 THE ANSWER IS "NOT A LOT."
 BECAUSE IN THE U.S. POTATOES ARE MARKETED,
 NOT BY VARIETY, WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN HELPFUL,
 BUT BY EITHER LOCATION OF ORIGIN OR BY COLOR--
 EITHER OF WHICH I FIND PRETTY CONFUSING.
 NOW LUCKILY, POTATOES CAN ALL BE FITTED INTO THREE CATEGORIES,
 DEPENDING ON THEIR STARCH CONTENT--
 EITHER HIGH, MEDIUM OR LOW.
 SO THE SECRET TO HAPPY POTATO COOKING IS KNOWING,
 WELL, WHICH POTATO FITS INTO WHICH CATEGORY.
 NOW NOMENCLATURE MAY NOT BE MUCH OF A HELP TO US,
 BUT LOOKING FOR A FEW SIMPLE PHYSICAL TRAITS IS.
 LET'S TAKE A TOUR.
 AND NOW REPRESENTING THE HIGH STARCH OR MEALY POTATO,
 AND WEIGHING IN AT ANYWHERE FROM A FEW OUNCES TO,
 WELL, OVER A POUND,
 THE BAKER, A.K.A. THE RUSSET, A.K.A. THE BURBANK RUSSET--
 NAMED AFTER A HORTICULTURIST, LUTHER BURBANK,
 WHO INVENTED THE SPUD... WELL, DEVELOPED IT BACK IN 1872.
 RUSSETS AND ALL HIGH- STARCH POTATOES
 ARE GREAT FOR WHIPPING, MASHING, FRYING AND BAKING.
 AH, BAKED POTATOES-- SO SIMPLE, SO PERFECT,
 AND YET SO MISUNDERSTOOD.
 THE WORLD'S BEST BAKED POTATO GOES LIKE THIS...
 FIRST PREHEAT YOUR OVEN TO 350 DEGREES,
 THEN CAREFULLY APPROACH THE SPUDS.
 HERE'S THE SECRET--RUSSETS.
 I LIKE WASHINGTON STATE, BUT IDAHO'S FINE, TOO.
 NOW THE FIRST THING YOU WANT TO DO IS GO PSYCHO ON THE POTATO.
 YOU WANT TO POKE HOLES ALL OVER IT WITH A FORK.
 NOW THAT'LL LET STEAM OUT OF IT AS IT FORMS,
 WHICH'LL HELP YOU GET THAT NICE FLUFFY TEXTURE
 THAT WE ALL SO DESIRE.
 NOW INTO A BOWL, AND GIVE IT JUST A LITTLE BIT OF OIL.
 NOW WHAT THIS IS GONNA DO IS GIVE US KIND OF A CRUNCHY SKIN,
 BUT ALSO BECAUSE THE OIL CAN GET SO MUCH HOTTER
 THAN THE WATER INSIDE THE POTATO,
 IT'S GONNA REGULATE THE MOISTURE IN THERE,
 AND IT'LL ACTUALLY HELP GIVE US THAT TEXTURE THAT WE WANT.
 NOW BECAUSE I LIKE TO EAT THE SKINS,
 I GIVE IT A BIT OF KOSHER SALT--JUST TO UP THE ANTE.
 NOW INTO THE OVEN...
 NO BAKING SHEET, NO PANS, NOTHING FANCY,
 JUST STRAIGHT INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE OVEN, LIKE THAT.
 NOW YOUR AVERAGE RUSSET'S GOING TO BE DONE IN ABOUT AN HOUR,
 AND THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO TELL IF IT'S FINISHED--
 YOU GOTTA GIVE IT A SQUEEZE.
 IF THE SKIN FEELS KIND OF CRUNCHY,
 BUT THE MEAT INSIDE IS SOFT,
 IT'S DINNERTIME!
 AND UNLESS YOU LIKE LIMP, SOGGY, GUMMY BAKED POTATOES,
 PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THE FOIL.
 IF YOU'RE IN A HURRY, YOU CAN START A POTATO IN THE MICROWAVE.
 JUST PUT IT ON HIGH FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES...
 BUT DO YOURSELF A FAVOR, FINISH IT IN THE OVEN.
 REPRESENTING THE LOW-STARCH OR WAXY POTATO IS THE NORLAND,
 WHICH IS SOMETIMES JUST CALLED A RED OR A BOILING POTATO.
 NOW ALTHOUGH THE GREAT MAJORITY OF LOW-STARCH POTATOES ARE ROUND AND RED,
 THERE ARE ALSO FINGERLING POTATOES THAT LOOK LIKE...
 WELL, YOU GUESSED IT.
 NOW THESE SPUDS GET THE SHORT END OF THE NAME STICK,
 BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE DOZENS OF VARIETIES,
 FROM PONTIACS TO LASODAS TO NORLANDS,
 THEY'RE OFTEN JUST CALLED RED.
 SOME PEOPLE EVEN CALL THEM NEW POTATOES,
 WHICH IS KIND OF FUNNY,
 SINCE NEW POTATOES ARE JUST LITTLE BABY VERSIONS OF ANY POTATO.
 REMEMBER WHAT RICHARD DREYFUSS
 MADE A MOUNTAIN OUT OF IN "CLOSE ENCOUNTERS"?
 HMM?... MASHED POTATOES.
 THAT'S RIGHT--THE GRAND POOH BAH OF COMFORT FOOD.
 WHEN I'M MAKING MASHERS,
 I LIKE TO USE TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF POTATOES.
 I USE PEELED RUSSETS, AND I USE UNPEELED RED POTATOES.
 NOW IF WE WERE JUST GOING TO MAKE REAL SUPER- VELVETY CONSISTENCY,
 KIND OF FLUFFY, WHIPPED POTATOES, WE WOULD JUST USE THE RUSSETS,
 BECAUSE THEY BREAK DOWN SO NICE WHEN THEY COOK.
 THEY GET NICE AND FLUFFY.
 BUT YOU KNOW... WHEN I MAKE MASHERS,
 I REALLY DO WANT SOME CHUNKS.
 I WANT A LITTLE CONTRAST FOR MY MOUTH TO GET INTO,
 AND THAT'S WHERE THESE LITTLE RED GUYS COME IN.
 BECAUSE THESE ARE LOW- STARCH, WAXY POTATOES,
 THEY'LL STAY CHUNKY EVEN AFTER THEY'RE COOKED,
 AND THAT'S WHAT I'M AFTER.
 SO EVERYTHING GOES IN THE POT TOGETHER.
 BY THE WAY, I'M USING, I GUESS, ABOUT A TWO-TO-ONE RATIO OF RUSSETS TO REDS,
 BUT YOU CAN CHANGE IT AROUND TO YOUR TASTE.
 NOW WE'RE GONNA FILL THIS POT WITH HOT WATER,
 ONLY TO THE TOP OF THE POTATOES.
 WE JUST BARELY WANT TO COVER THEM.
 MORE WATER WILL ONLY SLOW DOWN THE COOKING,
 AND YOU GOT A CHANCE OF WATERLOGGING THE POTATOES.
 OKAY, THAT'S PLENTY.
 NOW POTATOES, LIKE PASTA AND EGGS,
 REALLY DO NEED SOME SALT TO TASTE LIKE THEMSELVES,
 AND NOW'S REALLY THE TIME TO DO IT.
 IF YOU DO IT LATER, YOU'RE NEVER GONNA GET THE FLAVOR THE SAME.
 NOW I LIKE TO GET THE WATER TO TASTE KIND OF LIKE SEAWATER,
 SO I'M GONNA HEAT THIS UP,
 AND I'LL TASTE IT AFTER IT DISSOLVES.
 NOW HIGH HEAT, AND PUT A COVER ON THE POT,
 BECAUSE A COVERED POT ALWAYS BOILS FASTER.
 MASHED POTATOES REALLY DO NEED TWO THINGS...
 THEY NEED SOME DAIRY,
 AND THEY NEED AT LEAST A LITTLE BIT OF FAT.
 NOW THERE ARE SOME HEALTH PUNDITS OUT THERE WHO WOULD SAY,
 "WELL, YOU CAN MAKE PERFECTLY GOOD MASHED POTATOES
 "JUST WITH SOME VEGETABLE STOCK OR SOME TOFU JUICE."
 I DON'T KNOW... THAT SOUNDS LIKE A CHARLES DICKENS NOVEL
 IN A BOWL, TO ME.
 I LIKE TO USE LOW-FAT BUTTERMILK, NOT SKIM BUTTERMILK.
 THAT'S GONNA ADD SOME TANGINESS AND A NICE TEXTURE.
 ... ALSO USE JUST A LITTLE BIT OF WHIPPING CREAM.
 WHAT THAT'S GOING TO DO IS CARRY THE FLAVOR OF THE GARLIC,
 AND IT'S ALSO GOING TO STABILIZE THIS,
 SO THAT THIS SAUCE DOESN'T BREAK AS IT COOKS.
 NOW BREAKING HAS TO DO WITH ACID AND DAIRY AND HEAT--
 THE STUFF WE'LL GET INTO LATER.
 NOW I JUST EYEBALL THIS.
 I NEVER KNOW HOW MUCH I'M REALLY GOING TO NEED,
 BUT IF YOU TWISTED MY ARM, I'D SAY THAT YOU'LL BE FINE
 WITH A TOTAL OF ABOUT 1/4 CUP OF DAIRY PER POUND OF POTATO.
 NOW WE'RE GONNA PUT THIS ON TO SIMMER FOR ABOUT 15 MINUTES,
 OR UNTIL THAT GARLIC IS NICE AND SOFT.
 WHATEVER YOU DO, YOU DON'T WANT TO LET THIS BOIL, THOUGH,
 'CAUSE IT WILL REALLY MAKE A MESS.
 ONCE YOUR POTATOES COME TO A BOIL,
 PROBABLY BE DONE IN JUST A COUPLE OF MINUTES.
 IF THEY'RE NOT, GO AHEAD AND BACK OFF OF THE HEAT JUST A LITTLE BIT,
 BECAUSE IF THESE COME TO A ROLLING BOIL,
 THEY'RE GONNA WATERLOG.
 THEY'RE GONNA FALL APART AND GET SOGGY AND DISGUSTING.
 THAT YOU DON'T WANT.
 WE'RE JUST GONNA GIVE THESE A COUPLE MORE MINUTES.
 WE'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF TALKING ABOUT STARCH.
 AND WHAT IS IT, EXACTLY? AND WHY SHOULD WE CARE?
 WELL, THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT STARCHES
 IN THE VEGETABLE WORLD,
 BUT YOU CAN THINK OF POTATO STARCH AS TINY LITTLE GRANULES
 MADE UP OF LONG STRANDS OF A SUGAR CALLED GLUCOSE--
 KIND OF LIKE FUEL CELLS FOR THE POTATO.
 NOW THESE LITTLE GRANULES ARE VERY STABLE
 UNTIL THEY COME IN CONTACT WITH HEAT AND MOISTURE.
 NOW THERE'S ALREADY PLENTY OF MOISTURE IN A POTATO,
 SO ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS GET A TEMPERATURE UP TO ABOUT--OH!--160 DEGREES,
 AND THESE LITTLE GRANULES CHANGE.
 THEY START TAKING IN THE WATER AROUND THEM,
 AND THEY BLOW UP TO... WELL, HUNDREDS OF TIMES THEIR NORMAL SIZE.
 THE RESULT...
 A LIGHT AND FLUFFY POTATO.
 NOW THE REASON WE POKE HOLES IN BAKING POTATOES,
 AND WHY WE WOULD NEVER, SAY, LET A POT OF RED NORLANDS
 JUST BOIL AND BOIL AND BOIL,
 THERE IS SUCH A THING AS TOO MUCH HEAT AND TOO MUCH WATER,
 AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS...
 WELL, IT'S NOT SO FLUFFY.
 WE'VE GIVEN THESE A COUPLE MORE MINUTES,
 AND I THINK THEY'RE DONE.
 JUST PICK 'EM UP WITH SOME TONGS AND GIVE 'EM A SQUEEZE.
 IF THEY CRUMBLE LIKE THAT, YOU'RE GOOD TO GO.
 WE ARE GOING TO DUMP THESE INTO A COLANDER
 AND THEN PUT THEM RIGHT BACK INTO THE POT FOR MASHING.
 A ONE-DOLLAR, FLEA MARKET POTATO MASHER IS ALL YOU NEED.
 NOW OUR MIXTURE'S READY--
 GOT SOME NICE SOFTENED GARLIC IN THERE.
 SO WE'RE GONNA START MASHING BY ADDING JUST A LITTLE BIT OF THE MIXTURE.
 YOU DON'T WANT TO GO OVERBOARD ON THIS STUFF,
 BECAUSE BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, YOU COULD HAVE POTATO SOUP,
 WHICH IS NICE, BUT IT'S NOT REALLY WHAT WE'RE AFTER.
 SO WE MASH.
 NOW WE DON'T WANT TO OVERDO THE MASHING, EITHER,
 BECAUSE POTATOES CAN KIND OF GET GLUEY ON YOU,
 AND WE DON'T WANT TO LOSE THAT CHUNKY TEXTURE
 THAT WE PUT THE RED POTATOES IN HERE TO GET.
 I'M GONNA GO WITH JUST A LITTLE MORE OF THE MIXTURE.
 THAT IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE ENOUGH.
 EVERY TIME YOU MAKE THIS, IT'S GONNA BE A LITTLE DIFFERENT,
 SO IT'S ALWAYS NICE TO HAVE A LITTLE MORE OF THE MIXTURE
 THAN YOU THINK YOU MIGHT NEED.
 I LIKE THE WAY THAT LOOKS.
 I'M GONNA GIVE THAT A TASTE.
 YOU CAN SEE THE RED SKIN IN THERE,
 AND YOU STILL SEE THE CHUNKS ALONG WITH THE CREAMY.
 MM!
 BEFORE YOU LAY THEM OUT IN FRONT OF YOUR PAVLOVIAN TABLE GUESTS,
 YOU MIGHT WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AROUND YOUR REFRIGERATOR.
 REMEMBER WHAT WE SAID...
 POTATOES ARE GREAT REFRIGERATOR VELCRO,
 AND YOU CAN MAKE SOME PRETTY NICE, SPECIAL DISHES OUT OF LEFTOVERS.
 THERE WE GO.
 NOW WE'VE GOT SOME SAUTéED ONIONS OVER HERE,
 SOME SUN-DRIED TOMATOES, SOME PESTO...
 OH, AND MY FAVORITE, BACON--LOVE BACON.
 NOW JUST BY ADDING ONE OR TWO OF THESE THINGS--
 MAYBE SOME HORSERADISH, WHICH IS MY FAVORITE--
 ALL OF A SUDDEN WE'VE TURNED, YOU KNOW,
 A PERFECTLY ACCEPTABLE PILE OF MASHED POTATOES
 INTO SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT SPECIAL.
 NOW IF YOU WANTED TO,
 YOU COULD SPLIT THIS MOTHER LODE INTO THREE DIFFERENT BOWLS
 AND KIND OF LAY THESE OUT AND HAVE A MASHED-POTATO PARTY.
 AND YOU KNOW, THAT'S KIND OF NICE,
 BECAUSE THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN A BASICALLY RUSTIC DISH
 BECOMES A CORNUCOPIA OF SPLENDOR AND, HEY! YOU'RE A HERO.
 NOW STEPPING UP FOR THE MEDIUM-STARCH POTATO CATEGORY
 IS THE YUKON GOLD, A RELATIVE NEWCOMER IN THE POTATO FIELD--
 HUH--DEVELOPED BY THE CANADIANS ABOUT 20 YEARS AGO.
 NOW MEDIUM-STARCH POTATOES DO LOOK KIND OF LIKE RUSSETS,
 BUT THEY ALWAYS HAVE LIGHTER, KIND OF THINNER SKIN.
 NOW VARIETIES LIKE THIS YUKON GOLD, KENNEBECS, SUPERIORS,
 OR, SAY, THESE CALIFORNIA LONGS,
 ARE FOR SOME REASON ALWAYS MARKETED AS JUST WHITE.
 RACISM--IT'S UGLY, EVEN IN TUBERS.
 NOW FOR SOME REASON THESE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN CONSIDERED
 ALL-PURPOSE POTATOES, WHICH IS KIND OF FUNNY.
 I MEAN, THEY DO HOLD TOGETHER KIND OF LIKE A WAXY,
 AND THEY GET KIND OF FLUFFY LIKE A MEALY,
 BUT WHERE THESE REALLY EXCEL IS IN SCALLOPED DISHES--
 PANCAKES AND GRATINS.
 EVERYBODY'S TALKING THESE DAYS ABOUT FRESH INGREDIENTS...
 EVERYTHING MUST BE FRESH!
 WELL, WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO WITH ALL THE STUFF I'VE GOT
 THAT'S NOT SO FRESH?
 I MEAN, AM I SUPPOSED TO BURY THIS STUFF IN THE YARD
 WHEN THE NEIGHBORS AREN'T LOOKING?
 I DON'T THINK SO.
 LUCKILY, POTATOES ARE A LOT LIKE EGGS AND PASTA.
 THEY CAN HELP YOU GET RID OF THINGS THAT ARE KIND OF HANGING AROUND,
 GETTING READY TO GROW FUR.
 NOW LET ME SEE... MY RECONNAISSANCE IS FLUSHED--
 AN OLD BLOCK OF ASIAGO CHEESE,
 SOME PORTOBELLO MUSHROOMS FROM LAST NIGHT'S SALAD,
 AND SOME PRETTY MIDDLE- AGED-LOOKING PARSLEY.
 CLEARLY, IT'S TIME TO MAKE A GRATIN.
 NOW A GRATIN IS BASICALLY JUST A CASSEROLE
 CONSTRUCTED OUT OF THIN SLICES OF POTATO, LAYERED WITH...
 WELL, WHATEVER YOU SALVAGED FROM YOUR REFRIGERATOR.
 NOW THESE THINGS CAN LOOK KIND OF INTIMIDATING,
 BUT THEY'RE IMPRESSIVE AT THE SAME TIME.
 I'VE SEEN RECIPES CALL FOR SIX POUNDS OF POTATOES,
 ALL SLICED ONE-SIXTEENTH OF AN INCH THICK.
 I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT I LEAVE MY CALIPERS DOWN AT THE LAB WHEN I COME HOME.
 NOW THE TRICK IS... NOBODY SAID YOU HAD TO USE A KNIFE.
 ANYBODY WHO WOULD WANT TO NEEDS SOME PROFESSIONAL HELP.
 NOW A MANDOLIN IS PERFECT FOR EXECUTING A LOT OF UNIFORM CUTS, QUICKLY.
 IT CAN SLICE, IT CAN SHRED,
 MAKE SHOESTRINGS, WAFFLE CUTS, WHATEVER.
 NOW I'M NOT SAYING ANYTHING CAN REPLACE GOOD KNIFE SKILLS,
 BUT COME ON!--YOU HAVE TO BE A CIRCUS KNIFE THROWER
 TO OUTPACE THIS PUPPY.
 NOW THIS PROFESSIONAL MODEL'S SWEET,
 BUILT LIKE A TANK, FULL OF FEATURES...
 AND WELL OVER $100.
 WE'VE GOT A WHOLE VARIETY OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF SLICERS
 AND GRATERS AND THINGS HERE. WE'RE JUST DOING SOME BASIC SLICING,
 GONNA MAKE A GRATIN. V-SLICER IS GREAT FOR THAT.
 IT HAS ADJUSTABLE WIDTHS, SO YOU CAN ADJUST THE THICKNESS
 OF WHATEVER IT IS YOU'RE SLICING.
 AND OF COURSE, IT HAS A HAND GUARD,
 WHICH I HAVE A FEELING YOU'RE GOING TO BE NEEDING.
 OKAY, THANKS.
 HEY... DO YOU LIKE POTATOES?
 OH, I'M PASSIONATE ABOUT THEM. OKAY.
 NOW MEDIUM-STARCH POTATOES LIKE THESE YUKON GOLDS
 ARE REALLY PERFECT GRATIN FODDER,
 BECAUSE THEY'LL BIND TOGETHER WHEN THEY COOK,
 WITHOUT LOSING THEIR CONSISTENCY.
 I MUST WARN YOU TO USE THE HAND GUARD!
 BECAUSE THE LAST THING YOU WANT
 IS TO FIND FINGERNAIL PIECES IN YOUR GRATIN.
 BUTTER YOUR CASSEROLE FIRST, BECAUSE BELIEVE ME,
 THIS WILL SET UP LIKE CONCRETE IF YOU DON'T--I'VE BEEN THERE.
 SO IT'S A LOT LIKE BUILDING A SKYSCRAPER.
 WE'RE JUST GOING TO PUT DOWN A LAYER OF POTATOES.
 CASINO DEALERS ARE REALLY GOOD AT THIS,
 AND A LOT FASTER THAN I AM.
 AND THEN WE'RE JUST GONNA PUT THE OTHER INGREDIENTS ON TOP
 AND THEN REPEAT IT UNTIL WE'VE GOT ABOUT FOUR LAYERS DOWN.
 NOW SOME MUSHROOMS...
 YOU WANT TO GO KIND OF LIGHT ON THE MUSHROOMS,
 BECAUSE THEY'LL FORM A BARRIER
 IN-BETWEEN THE LOWER AND UPPER POTATO LAYER,
 AND THAT'LL KEEP THE GRATIN FROM SETTING.
 YOU'LL END UP WITH CHOWDER INSTEAD OF A GRATIN.
 SO THAT'S ENOUGH.
 ... A LITTLE BIT OF PARSLEY, NOT MUCH.
 SOME SALT--MORE THAN YOU THINK YOU NEED,
 'CAUSE POTATOES ALWAYS NEED SALT.
 ... A FEW GRINDS OF PEPPER,
 AND A LITTLE BIT OF THAT ASIAGO CHEESE.
 AGAIN, THAT'S GONNA GO ON EVERY LAYER, SO GO EASY.
 YOU DON'T HAVE TO PUT A LOAD ON EVERY SINGLE LAYER.
 SO WE'RE JUST FINISHING UP THE FOURTH LAYER OF THE GRATIN.
 NOW BEFORE WE PUT ON ANY OTHER INGREDIENTS,
 WE'RE GONNA ADD SOME DAIRY,
 AND THAT'S GONNA ENRICH THE FLAVOR.
 IT'S ALSO GONNA AID THE CONSISTENCY--
 HELP THE WHOLE THING TO BIND TOGETHER.
 NOW I LIKE USING HALF AND HALF.
 IF YOU CAN AFFORD THE CALORIES, YOU CAN USE CREAM...
 THAT'S WHAT THE FRENCH DO.
 AND IF YOU WANT, YOU CAN USE CREAM COMBINED WITH MILK,
 WHICH IS... HOMEMADE HALF AND HALF.
 ANYWAY... I ADD ABOUT HALF A CUP,
 THEN WE'RE GONNA SQUEEZE THE WHOLE THING.
 NOW THAT'S TO GET THE HALF AND HALF REALLY DISTRIBUTED,
 AND ALSO TO GET ALL OF THE AIR BUBBLES OUT.
 NOW I KNOW I'VE GOT ENOUGH IN THERE,
 BECAUSE IT'S COMING UP AROUND THE EDGES,
 SO THAT'S GREAT.
 NOW I'VE GOT A 400 DEGREE OVEN.
 ANYWHERE BETWEEN 400 OR 450 IS FINE.
 NOW FOR ABOUT THE FIRST 45 MINUTES OF COOKING,
 I LIKE TO COVER THIS WITH FOIL... VERY LOOSELY.
 I DON'T WANT TO TRAP THE STEAM IN THERE,
 BUT I DO WANT IT TO STICK AROUND A LITTLE BIT
 AND HELP THE POTATOES COOK.
 DOING THIS ALSO HELPS US TO NOT OVERBROWN THE TOP,
 WHICH IS, OF COURSE, JUST ANOTHER WORD FOR BURNING.
 NOW EXCEPT FOR THESE LITTLE NEW POTATOES,
 WHICH DON'T STORE REAL WELL BECAUSE OF THEIR HIGH SUGAR CONTENT,
 MOST POTATOES WILL LAST 10, 20 DAYS, EASY,
 IF YOU HANDLE THEM RIGHT...
 EVEN LONGER IF YOU BUY THEM FRESH AT A FARM STAND.
 NOW YOUR ROOT CELLAR IS THE PERFECT PLACE TO STORE POTATOES.
 OH... OH, YOU DON'T HAVE A ROOT CELLAR.
 YEAH, WELL, NEITHER DO I... THAT'S OKAY.
 ANYPLACE DARK, DRY AND COOL IS FINE FOR POTATO STORAGE.
 FOR INSTANCE, A KITCHEN DRAWER'S FINE,
 AS LONG AS IT'S NOT NEXT TO THE DISHWASHER OR THE OVEN.
 NOW AN OPEN BASKET'S OKAY, TOO, DOWN INSIDE A CABINET,
 BUT YOU WANNA MAKE SURE THAT IT'S NOT THE CABINET UNDERNEATH YOUR SINK.
 IT'S HUMID IN THERE, AND IT'S PROBABLY ALREADY LOADED UP
 WITH CHEMICALS AND THINGS THAT ARE YUCKY WITH FOOD.
 NOW FOR THE TRULY SPACIALLY CHALLENGED,
 A PAPER BAG, ON THE COUNTER, FOLDED UP, IN A DRY PLACE.
 IT'S FINE.
 NOW LIKE ALL COOKING SHOWS, WE CAN FOLD SPACE AND TIME--
 FIFTY MINUTES HAS JUST DISAPPEARED.
 SO WE PULLED THE FOIL OFF ABOUT TEN MINUTES AGO
 TO LET THE TOP BROWN... LOOKS PRETTY GOOD.
 NOW THE ONLY WAY TO REALLY TELL IF THIS IS DONE
 IS TO GIVE IT A FEW POKES WITH A SHARP KNIFE OR A FORK.
 IF THE BLADE REALLY GOES IN EASILY,
 BUT YOU CAN STILL KIND OF FEEL A DELINEATION BETWEEN THE LAYERS,
 IT'S DINNERTIME!
 WELL, IT'S ALMOST DINNERTIME,
 BECAUSE THIS REALLY WILL BE A LOT BETTER
 IF IT'S ALLOWED JUST TO SIT FOR, SAY, 15 TO 30 MINUTES.
 THAT WAY THE LAYERS'LL BIND UP REALLY NICE,
 AND YOU'LL BE ABLE TO CUT IT INTO WEDGES EASILY.
 BELIEVE ME, IN HALF AN HOUR IT'LL STILL BE PLENTY HOT.
 AH, NOW THAT IS HEARTY FARE.
 LUCKY FOR ME, IT'S ABOUT AS COMPLICATED AS SITTING ON A SOFA.
 YOU KNOW, WE WORK HARD TO KEEP RECIPES AT BAY,
 HERE AT "GOOD EATS."
 WE'D RATHER YOU EXPERIMENT WITH YOUR FOOD,
 NOT GO BY LISTS OF INSTRUCTIONS AND INGREDIENTS.
 NOW THESE DISHES ARE A PERFECT EXAMPLE.
 GO AHEAD... BUILD A COUPLE OF GRATINS,
 MASH UP SOME MASHERS.
 IN NO TIME, FRIENDS AND FAMILY ARE GOING TO BE BEGGING YOU
 FOR RECIPES THAT YOU CAN HAPPILY ADMIT DON'T EXIST.
 THEY'LL BE IN AWE.
 NOW I HOPE YOU APPRECIATE THAT FRENCH FRY UNDER YOUR CAR SEAT
 MORE THAN YOU DID A HALF-HOUR AGO.
 JOIN US AGAIN FOR "GOOD EATS,"
 AND IN THE MEANTIME, LISTEN TO YOUR APPETITE,
 AND PLAY WITH YOUR FOOD.
