 HANK: Whose idea was this Internet horseshit anyway? Good morning, Lieutenant. Thank you. Welcome. Heller called, FBI's on the way. I figured as much. It's all over the Internet. It's going viral, as they say. HANK: Well, that don't sound good. TIM: Mmm-mmm. My son said to me this morning, they're calling him the Bridge Butcher. Daniel Frye leaked it. You got any kind of computer judo to figure out where she's being held at? No, video stream's been routed through a bunch of proxies. She's got a day at best. HANK: Cooper? TIM: Yes, sir? HANK: Get up with the search team, make sure that don't turn into a goat rodeo. TIM: Copy that. I want you to drag Frye's sorry ass in here, now. (THEME SONG PLAYING) Until I'm one with you My heart shall no! pass through Our love will be mistaken (SIGHS) You're gonna have to fix that. Kate can't know about this. (SPEAKING IN SPANISH) If she asks, just say we... We sold Rio. To who? I don't know, Cesar. Just make something up. (SPEAKING IN SPANISH) Nobody heard this happen. How is that possible? I was sleeping. I'm gonna have to upgrade the whole security system. It won't do any good. She wants that tunnel opened. And if I don't? It won't be a horse next time. Okay, open it. I'll take care of it. How? I'll call her. And that's it? For now. The less you know, the better. (SIGHS) We don't smoke out here. I do. When do you go back, exactly? Changed my ticket. My lawyer thought it was a good idea for me to stay here for the reading of the will. Oh. Okay. It's only fair, you know'? My mother, uh, Jane was her name... I remember her name. This was her garden. She liked to sit out here, watch the hummingbirds. Your father wanted a pool. Oh, yeah, I remember. That was about the same time my mom was getting chemo. Fun times. Your father loved you very much. (CHUCKLES) My father wasn't capable of love. You know that, don't you? You were just the shiny, new thing to him. Just like that stupid horse. Let the Mexican pick them up. Her name is Tina. And she has other work to do. That's right. Tina... ...found this. In the guest bedroom. I haven't heard from him this morning. He's not answering his phone. He's not in his apartment... Yeah, well, that's Frye. His editor doesn't know where he is, either. ADRIANA: Is this about the video? Did you know he had it? Yes. It's news. We've been over that already, Sonya. (SIGHS) Can I ask you some questions about the case? Media requests have to be filed with our public relations officer. Well, I was just hoping for something more off the record... (SPEAKING IN SPANISH) That's a bad place to rest, partner. (DISTANT SIREN WAILING) (SPEAKING IN SPANISH) (PANTING) No. Kilos? (SIGHS) No. Detective Sonya Cross, El Peso PD. Detective Marco Ruiz. Yeah? We're looking for Daniel Frye. Ah, he's here. He drank all my vodka and won't stop talking and he can't even get it up. Where are your pants? Bastard said I look fat in them. Nope, you look fine. Make him leave, now. (DOOR CLOSING) SONYA: Hey. MARCO: Hey, get up. Get up, I said. Oh, hey. Officer Friendly and Officer Frosty. We need you to come with us. Yeah, okay. MARCO: Come on. Yes, come on, get up. Let's do it. Hold on. Hold on a second. (RETCHING) Oh, my God. Oh, come on! You soft-dicked piece of shit! MARCO: Go. Come on. Come on. (SPANISH MUSIC PLAYING) (SPEAKING IN SPANISH) Señor Galvan. (SCREAMING) HANK: That feed's been live for hours. We're wasting time. RICHARD: We're working on tracing it. We're dealing with a highly intelligent and technically adept individual. How did it get out? Frye's responsible for that We got him in custody. And he has his phone? Yes, he does. And he'll cooperate? Yes. Soon as he dries out. RICHARD: Has the killer contacted him since? SONYA: Nothing since the video. RICHARD: Good. Agent Gedman here will take point on the negotiations. Our suspect has made a demand that is in keeping with his agenda. What agenda is that? This girl didn't do anything wrong. She was just trying to make a better life for herself. The killer wishes to inflame cultural sensitivities. The judge, the immigrants, money from prominent businessmen who profit from the border. How does Cristina Fuentes fit into that agenda? She was a prostitute. Might've been a practice kill. We need to focus on his demands. This is not about money. He's not a kidnapper. He's already killed 11 people. Your point, Detective? Ransom demands are an atypical methodology for a serial killer. He wants us to watch her die. He's abducted a woman. He's demanding money. We will proceed towards a positive outcome. Do you have the money for the drop? RICHARD: We're waiting on the Reserve. If and when the killer contacts the reporter, we should be ready with the drop. The victim is a Mexican citizen. I want to be a part of ii. Nope. This is a US operation, Detective. So we just sit back and watch you handle it? (SPEAKING IN SPANISH) I've negotiated over a hundred of these hostage situations, okay? Impressive. HELLER: Detective Ruiz, I'll make sure you're apprised of the situation as it develops. This is our investigation, Hank. HANK: Not anymore, Sonya. It's their show now. I'm sorry. (SIGHS) (EAGLE SCREECHING) (MAN SPEAKING IN SPANISH) No. It's all done now, Miss Charlotte. Just Charlotte, please. (SPEAKING IN SPANISH) Charlotte. Is it open? Yes. What do we do? Nothing. Did you call her? Yes. What did she say? (CHUCKLES) Nothing. It's just business. Maybe you should go do something. Do something? What the hell am I supposed to do, Cesar? Go shopping? This is illegal. Yes. Yes, it is. Did he give you a way to get in touch with him when the ransom has been gathered? No, he just sort of calls when he feels like it. Anything else you can tell us? (CLEARS THROAT) He's what I would call a doer. He doesn't talk so much. I'm guessing he's got some mommy issues or maybe some Mexican girl broke his heart. It's either that or he gets a big, fat chubby killing people and messing with cops. That girl is dying out there. Not for nothing, but this guy's trying to make a point. Nobody really gives a shit if some brown girl dies. As long as it stays south of the border, nobody cares. That's not true. Oh, yeah? Did you get the money yet? Hmm? 'Cause I'm betting if it was a pretty little coed with blonde hair and perfect teeth and big tits, the money would come raining in by now, bro. When this is all over, I'm gonna run you through the system, see what pops. I love it when you talk dirty. Where's the money'? Try not to be an asshole. She's getting weaker. (CLICKS TONGUE) She doesn't have long. Three or four hours. Why are you watching? There's got to be a way to figure out where she is. She keeps moving her eyes. It's like she's looking at something. MARCO: If you say so. You should take a break. Let's go for a walk. Why would I go for a walk? Sometimes you need to get away from a problem to figure it out. Yeah, well, you take a walk. I'm going to find her. Frye just got the call. Are you with the police, Daniel?  DANIEL: Yes. The Feds'! Them , toe . Good. You can always count on them to insert themselves where they're not wanted. They're good at insertion. Sorry. Names? (MOUTHS) Tell him. Heller and Gedman. Who'll be making the drop? (MOUTHS) Gedman. DANIEL: Gedman. Look forward in meeting him. Do you have {he money? Yes. That was fast. Uh... You've got everyone's attention. You made your point, trust me. I doubt that. Instructions to follow. (DISCONNECTS) We need that money now. It's coming. Needs to go through the proper channels. Why did he want to know your names? He wants a personal connection. Builds trust, show we can keep our word. Gedman. Well, that was... That was great, huh? I guess my work here is done. I'm gonna go get some tacos. You're not going anywhere, son. This guy Gedman looks nervous. You sure he's done this kind of thing before? Got a case of the yips? This isn't your average hostage-taker. He could be walking into an ambush. (CELLPHONE RINGING) Excuse me. Marco Ruiz. Okay. I'm sorry. I'll be right back. That's his wife. She calls all the lime. Well, he's got a strong marriage. You want that in a partner. (SPANISH MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO) (SPEAKING IN SPANISH) (BLOWS RASPBERRY) (CLICKS TONGUE) (CHUCKLES) (SIGHS) Got the money. Where did you find it? A donor who wishes to remain anonymous. We have to know where you got it, Detective. A prominent Mexican citizen. Yeah, we're gonna need a little more information than that. El Rey Storage. The man who owns it wants to help. RICHARD: I'd rather draw from the Reserve. Fewer potential problems should something happen with the money. We've been waiting on that Reserve money all day. Search has turned up squat. This money is your only shot. All right. Have a tracker put in this. Get wired up. If we have a shot at nabbing this guy, I don't want to miss it. I'm gonna go on the drop. You're not authorized to carry a weapon. I brought the money, the girl's Mexican, I'm going! We've arrived. He's expecting us. You prepared for this? I need you to answer me. Yes. (CHICKENS CLUCKING) Hello, Bob. Brother Steven. I'm not your brother. Yeah, we're all brothers in the eyes of the Lord. I don't share your views, Bob. You know, there's nothing. We're alone in the world. I've seen the void. I'll hold you in my prayers. Well, yeah. If that makes you feel better, Bob. Where is she? Eva, you can come out. Eva, this is Bob. Bob, this is Eva. Welcome to the ranch, Eva. Hello. Eva here wishes to change her life. Well, you've come to the right place. You said that I will have a job and place to live. That's true. Here at the ranch you can put your past behind you, find your grace, walk the path. Path? Hmm. I need a minute here, Bob. Of course. This is a safe place. Hector can't find you here. (SPEAKING IN SPANISH) That's what he does. He hunts people. He'll find me. Well, Bob here is like the right hand of God. He'll protect you from people who would seek to do you harm. How long do I have to stay? Well, I don't know. You can't go back. He'll kill you. I know. What do I owe you? (BREATHING HEAVILY) A kiss. That's it? (SPEAKING IN SPANISH) Yes, I would like that. (SPEAKING IN SPANISH) (SIGHS) I will remember that. Take care, Eva. (SPEAKING IN SPANISH) Come on. RICHARD: It's this circular area here, right? We got a spot for the drop. A Ray's Roadhouse. That's a difficult spot for a drop. You're gonna want to send somebody in to check it out first. Too risky. We'll keep a mile cushion. We can't afford to spook him. The important thing is, is we make the drop and get a visual on the suspect. If he shows up. Exactly. He'll show up. Yeah. What is it, Sonya? (WHISPERING) I know where she is. Uh, yeah. Don't wait for me, I'll catch up. He made a mistake. See that shadow? Listen, will you just tell me what it is? It's a pump jack. For oil. Son of a bitch. Come on. There aren't many of them around here. I know. Did you tell Cooper and the search team? Yup. I know where a few of them are at. Oh, can't get enough of us, Miss Millwright? I'm looking for Marco Ruiz. Well, he's in a meeting. Something I can help you with? Oh, I have his wallet. All right. Well, I'll just make sure he gets it back. Do you know how long he'll be in his meeting? You seen the news, hon? That girl in the desert? Yup. But you can leave a message if it's important, you know. No, it's okay. Get it back later. (CHUCKLES) You know this guy's not about the money. My partner thinks the same thing. What is up with her? Nothing. She's a little short bus, don't you think? No, I don't. She's fine. This guy poisons, what, nine Mexicans. What's one more? I don't think like that Really? I thought you guys were supposed to identify with the killer. Nope. So, I guess nine bodies in Juárez is a slow day. It's getting better. I don't know. I saw a guy get his brains blown all over the pavement. Uh... That's probably a cartel thing. Seemed like a random thing to me. So, does your family live down there? Yes. Bet your wife likes that, huh'? You don't know me that well to talk about my family. Sorry. Just sit there. Be quiet. El Rey Storage, that's where you got the money? Yes. When this is over, there will be questions about that. Let's just save this girl. That's the plan. Yep. Search team's scouring the hills for every oil pump and well they can find. I keep thinking she's gonna die alone out there. You thinking about Lisa? Nobody came for her, either. You can't think about that kind of stuff, Sonya. You been to see him lately? No. No? Wanted to. Drove all the way there and couldn't get out of the truck. That's good. That's good 'cause there's nothing there for you, Sonya. I know. I visited her grave instead. Did you have a happy thought like I told you'? I tried. I just couldn't think of anything. She's gone. Yes, she is, but that's why you got to keep her in your thoughts. Got to remember the good times. Hell, you got to remember the times she really pissed you off. You got to hold on to those. It's hard. Entering. Copy that. (SIGHS) What? What's wrong? I don't like this. (MUSIC PLAYING) Diet Coke with lime. Not here. I hope we're not wasting our time. Cooper says there's nothing at the Desantis oil fields. Any others in this area? Old Parch Ranch has got wells. You Ralph Gedman? Yeah. Supposed to give you this. Message for you. We have contact. Let's take him. We should take him. Hold- Hold a beat. RICHARD: What is it? Gedman? Gedman? (FEEDBACK) (SIGHS) Gedman, do you copy? (SPEAKING IN SPANISH) Down there! On the right. (PANTING) She's alive. MARCO: Okay, great. They got Maria. She's safe. Hey, that's great. Sir, I lost him. What do you mean, you lost him? His signal's not moving. What the hell's going on here'? Move in. Now. (TIRES SCREECH) (GROANING) Where is that EMT at? He's five out. Somethings going down at the drop. I don't want to leave her. Yeah, well, the ambulance will be here soon. That bar's just down the road. Come on. I'll take care of her. All right, just a little bit of water. (TIRES SQUEALING) Everybody against the wall! Let's move! FBI! Where'd he go? Where's! he go? Out the back! What happened, huh? What happened? I was told to give him a phone. He played the message and he left. Who told you to give him the phone? I don't know. I went to the bath room, there was an envelope on the bar with a note, some money. The phone was in there. I figured it was some kind of practical joke. Do you know what was in the phone? I don't know. Whatever it was, man, he looked sick. (CELLPHONE BEEPING) I got to take a leak. HELLER: You join them on that side. Follow me! Any sign of Gedman'? Nothing. The killer is here! We're setting up a secure perimeter. (DISTANT SIREN WAILING) (CELLPHONE BEEPING) Oh, shit. Over here! Over here! (BRAKES SCREECHING) Call Marco. (CELLPHONE RINGING) Hello. SONYA: Marco. Hey, Sonya, you're here? It's not good. We lost him. Come on out. (GRUNTING) (GUN COOKING) (GASPING) I have a family. Please don't do it. (GROANING) (SHUTTER OPENING) SONYA: Marco! (GROANING) Are you okay? Yes. Why didn't he kill you? I don't know. The money? HANK: It's here. (CELLPHONE BEEPING) I... Geez. (CELLPHONE CONTINUES BEEPING) (WOMAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) HANK: The same video. SONYA: Gedman. Ripped By mstoll
