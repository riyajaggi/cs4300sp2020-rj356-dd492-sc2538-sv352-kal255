 Lorraine Gates, the judge. There's a gal asking to talk to the cop in charge. She's American. The car came from El Paso. It's ours. Okay. (GROANS) Detective Sonya Cross. You have information? No, we just need to cross the bridge. You'll have to wait. We can't wait. My husband is having a heart attack. This is a crime scene. We need a hospital. The bridge is closed. Wait. I can pay you to let us cross. Ma'am, you can't cross. There are rules. This is a crime scene. I can't let you through. What were you doing in Juárez? Don't you know danger? We were just looking at some horses. (IN SPANISH) SONYA: Officer. What was the make and model of the car? I don't know. It's your job to know. Our job is border security and interdiction, not dead bodies, ma'am. The car would've crossed over into Juárez... And that makes it Mexico's problem. Stop... Hey! Stop! Hey! Stop! (SIREN WAILING) Who authorized that? I did. You compromised the scene. Her husband was very sick. What's your name, again? Marco Ruiz. Badge number? (CHUCKLES) He needed a hospital. There are hospitals in Mexico. They're American, they wanted an American hospital. Why does that matter? It does. Here. You had no right. This is a US case. I don't need your body. Just this morning, I got nine heads in the parking lot of City Hall. Why tell me that? We've got our own dead. How do you let that happen? Okay, muchachos. The güeros are taking the body, I'm going back to sleep. (ENGINE STARTS) (WOLF WHISTLING) (DANCE MUSIC PLAYING) (CHATTERING) MAN: For your tears. Are you the one? Yes. I am the one. (IN SPANISH) Shh... No, no, no, espérate! I'm done. Whoa! Oh, shit. He said it's a routine procedure. Nothing to it. Charlotte. Charlotte. I'm right here. I saw the other side. I mean the goddamned hereafter. Oh, I know. Made me realize you got to get your life right. My life is just right. Charlotte. I have to tell you something. Okay. I don't love you. I want a divorce. Are you sure it's Judge Gates? In two pieces. Damn. The Mexicans didn't want the body. The Feds? They don't know yet. Well, they will. Border Patrol, DEA, ICE, FBI, come morning, they'll all be sticking their beaks in. It's mine, Hank. Yeah, right now, it is. So you know the Feds are gonna want in. Can you protect me? Yeah, I'll do my level best. How the hell do you work this thing? What? Lorraine Gates on the Bridge of the Americas. I think somebody's trying to send a message. What kind of message? Well, she's anti-immigration, she believes in the wall, anti-DREAM Act. Hell, she don't like Mexicans, thinks they ought to stay in Mexico. Have you told the family yet? I'm on my way now. Ifs the middle of the night and there are children in that house. I know. So tread lightly. Their mother was murdered, there's no other way to say it. (SIGHS) Right, well, remember eye contact, all right? Right. I will. Good morning, Lieutenant. Good morning, Miss Kitty. How in the Sam Hill do you work this thing? I just go to Starbucks. SONYA: When was the last time you talked to your wife? MIKE: She was going to Austin for a conference. Flying? No, she drove. I called her around 10:30 but there was no answer. She was dead by then. Excuse me? Which is very sad for you. Yeah. Would you like a glass of water? How was she killed? I mean, what did they do to her? We have two little kids. Would you like a glass of water? No. I'm gonna need your phone. Okay. Password-protected? I don't even know how to do that. Any recent threats? Judges get lots of threats. That's why I'm asking. She just made a ruling against some Mexicans. You know, stopping them from standing on the corners looking for work. Why? Why what? Why can't they stand at a corner? (LAUGHS) Uh... It's a traffic issue. You have a right to stand on a public street. And to signal by your presence in that particular place that you're looking for day work. What the hell are you talking about? Any affairs? (SCOFFS) No! Of course not. Drugs? Lorraine was a mother, for Christ's sake. My mother used drugs. Okay, that's it. Lady, I want you the hell out of my house. I... I'm sorry if I didn't exercise empathy. (GUNS FIRING OVER HEADPHONES) Gus. Gus. What? I can smell it. What? Cómo what? The dope, Ia more. Where'd you get it? Tm "m school. Do you know who Tico's uncle is? Aurelio Guetta. Hmm? Ring a bell? That's where your dope comes from. It was just a joint. Well, now you owe him. Maybe his uncle will ask you to make a delivery for him. Drive him somewhere. That's not how it is, okay'? No. (SPEAKING SPANISH) That is exactly the way it is. That's how you get caught up. All right, esos culeros, they reach out and get you like that. Como mosquito. You're going across for class, coming right back, all right? No parties, no Tico. Understand? Okay, OKay? (IN SPANISH) Okay. Did you check on Gus? Yes. Was he? Maybe he had, um, night class. No. No, he didn't No? Well, I'll talk to him tomorrow. I don't know how you stand this place. You learn so much in autopsy. So, did you go easy on the judge's husband? Yeah. Well... Sonya. I tried. Anyway, he didn't do it. No? Talked about all the right things. Gave up his phone, which he doesn't even know how to lock, so... That's not the guy who wired the bridge lights to go out. That's a good point. Our guy has tech skills. Hey. All right, meet you in there. Got to warn Carmen, she's waking up to an empty bed. (DIALING) Morning, Sonya. Okay. Cause of death's right here. Needle to the base of the spine and into the brain.

Did you find half a body in Juárez? Hispanic, late teens to 20. You would have the upper half. (GROANING) Something wrong? No, no. I'm listening;. Cut in half? Yes. Do you have a girl that matches this description? Well, we have lots of bodies, we have lots of parts and bones and, uh, skulls and... It could be a year old. Her legs were frozen. Frozen? Yes. Can you look into it? Of course, yeah. I'll do ii first thing in the morning. Who can I call to look into it now? (SPEAKING SPANISH) I'll do it. I'll do it. I'll call you back. (HANGS UP) When?

By daylight, the FBI is gonna be here. I'll deal with the Feds. We're probably looking at some sort of task force situation. Well, I want to lead it, Hank. This is my case. You sure about that? 'Cause a case like this can change you. I can handle it. I'm not talking about jurisdictional bullshit. I'm talking about two chopped-up women. It'll leave a scratch on your soul, give you bad dreams. I don't dream. (CELL PHONE BUZZES) Sonya Cross. MARCO: Cristina Fuentes. Nineteen. Came north to work in the maquiladoras. Partial remains... Señior. Partial remains found in a death house with 22 others. Death house? Yeah, old buildings where the sicarios dump bodies. Fill up one, find another. When was she found? About a year and a ha]? ago. R matches. Can you send the file? I think it's better if I come to you. She's one of them. One what? The dead girls of Juárez. Just give me half an hour, all right? No. That's not necessary. It's our case. Helm? Hello? He's coming here. Good. Why is that good? Well, he's got a body of his own, right? He doesn't care about his. He called you at 4:00 a.m. with a name, didn't he? Fine. We got two bodies directly on an international border. This case is gonna take us down south. Last time I checked that badge on your hip don't mean shit in Juárez. I told you to use the ladies room, Sonya. Yeah. Next time. (IN SPANISH) Watch out for the rattlesnakes. They come out at night. (GROANS) (scams) Help me, please. You can scream if you want to. There's no one around for miles. You hurt yourself. You're in a safe place. Ow! Ow! You must be tired. I'll be back. Hey, no, no, no. (BANGING) Hey! (ENGINE STARTS) (DOOR OPENS) (DOOR CLOSES) E-mail would have been quicker. But not as pleasant. I brought you breakfast Where's the file? Where are you going? Going with you. Why? 'Cause you've got my file. My boss says there's going to be a task force. Probably. Sure you want to be on it? Cristina Fuentes was found six blocks away from my house. So, yes. (DOOR BUZZES) This is CAP. Crimes Against Persons. We do homicides. He needs a day pass. It might be for more than a day. Good morning, Kitty. Good morning. Who are you, hon? Uh, Detective Marco Ruiz. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Okay, okay. No comprendo. Was born and raised in El Paso, don't speak a word. Sorry. I said I will be assisting Detective Cross in her investigation. That ought to be interesting. Why's that? Well, Sonya's an interesting gal. I noticed. Yeah. Would you like a pan dulce? Oh, no, no, no. I'm on a diet. The ones with walnuts are really good. Oh, hell, okay. It's just... Thank you. There you go. Just keep it here for a coffee break. Oh. All right, then. Here you go. Thank you. See you later, Kitty. I hope so. Can we start? Yep. You have your badge? Yup. Need me to translate for you? No. (SPEAKING SPANISH) (GROANS) Can you sit? Um... No, actually, I can't. You're irritating me. Oh. Then I just stand still. Why can't you sit? I had a procedure... A vasectomy, a few days back. I already have three children. Two marriages. It was time. Do you have any children? No. Why not? Evidence was collected but never processed. Huh? Yeah? Yeah. Yes. (CLEARS THROAT) You drove here, right? Yup. Pretend that chair is a car. Oh... Sorry. Okay. I'll try. How was she killed? Ah... I don't know. Your name's on the report. Yeah, my name is on a lot of reports. There are no interviews, not even with her parents. There is a saying in Juárez... (SPEAKING SPANISH) "From the bowl to the mouth, the soup falls." What does that have to do with this? Cristina Fuentes is only one of 250 girls who disappeared last year. They go missing from the buses, the factories. Always 15 to 20 years old, dark hair, beautiful. So, you have a serial killer? No one knows. And no one tries to find out? There are just too many. And the chiefs, they really don't want us to investigate. Easier that way. Easier how? Hey, I'm Lieutenant Hank Wade. (GREETS IN SPANISH) Marco Ruiz. His name is on the report for Cristina Fuentes. But he didn't investigate at all. Well, now he gets a second chance. Sheriff's department found the judge's car. Where? Off of highway 180. MARCO: I guess she's driving. Yup. Bit of advice. MARCO: Yeah? Buckle up, amigo. I will. (TIRES SQUEAL) (HARD ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO) This all we got? Tape's stuck. I can get it out. Don't! The truck was my sister's. She died. I'm sorry. So, you like horses? No. Did you take money from that woman? What woman? On the bridge. To let her pass. No. They say you're all corrupt. Mexican police, you all take bribes. Not all of us. The cartels threaten everyone, and... Sometimes, for some people, it's a lot easier to just look the other way. For a price, of course. They give you money so you won't do the police work? Not exactly. They tell you, "Plata o plomo.“ "Take our silver or take our lead." So, you just let the girls die? I do the best I can. But the situation is... (SPEAKING SPANISH) You should try harder. Of course I should. I heard about Señor Karl, señora. Did you tell the rest of the staff? Yes. Good. Because I don't want to be disturbed. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Man come to shake my hand And rob me of my farm I shot him dead and I hung my head And drove off in his car So, on the run with a smoking gun Looking for the coast And all the things I've had and lost Your love I miss the mos! And hell we'll have to pay I wen! a lime bit too far I'd say (BEEPS) Half drunk, I stumble on (BEEPS) The whiskey from the bar (BUZZING) And there's nothing but the ground (WOMAN SPEAKING SPANISH) Karl? It's the only place We found Who is this? (HANGS UP) (HORSE NEIGHS) No one has bothered you, yeah? No. This was in Karl's pocket. Have you seen it before? No. Why? A woman called for him. He's gone, Cesar. You answer to me now. (AGREES IN SPANISH) Who is she? I don't know. What about this? I found it in his wallet. Miss Charlotte, I don't know. I... You're lying, Cesar. What is it? It's better that I show you. Come. Where are we going? It's just a little farther. I've never seen this part of the ranch. Come. (DOOR CREAKS OPEN) Down there. God damn it, Cesar, I don't like this. It's okay, señora. Come. There. Is that what the key's for? (AFFIRMS IN SPANISH) What's in there? (HARD ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) (MUSIC STOPS) Ma'am, you may not want to look. Excuse me. Of course, it's county jurisdiction. The case originated with El Paso PD. Sheriff's department found her body. Of course... This is my case, not the county's. Step aside, please. Suit yourself. He drained the blood. He's neat. We dealing with a doctor? Maybe. Where's her purse? Driver's seat. (CLEARS THROAT) Everything's there. Cash, credit cards, what have you. Did it all by the book. Did you pull her ID? No, ma'am. Then it's missing. Maybe that is his trophy. Did Cristina have her ID? I don't remember. Well, her parents would know. We'll go to Juárez, ask them. MARCO: I don't think that's a good idea. Why? You want to put up your hoodie, tug back your hair? I'm not taking you to Juárez. Forget about it. Would you like to write up the scene? Go ahead. (CRACKLING) Judge Gates. Boy, she needed bent-over-a-couch, bad. Yeah, well, she got worse. Half of her is in the Pecos morgue. And the Mexicans want in on this? Their half is one of the missing Juárez girls. Mmm. Well, putting up them pink crosses sure as shit ain't working. This fella know about Sonya? Know what? That she's a bona fide whack job? Have you seen what she keeps in the bottom drawer of that desk? No, I have not, Timmy. Nor do I care. Oh, Hank, listen, if you've seen it, then... Marco Ruiz, Tim Cooper. Well, buenos días. Howdy, partner. You have the footage of the bridge? I do. Went a few rounds with those Homeland Security jag-offs, but I got it. Sonya, can I talk to you a second? And it looks like you're stuck with me, Detective Ruiz. That's okay. Have a seat. What is this? Oh, um... I filed a report on Marco with the Mexican state police. Yeah, I see that. He compromised the scene. He let an ambulance drive through it. Because a man was having a heart attack. Yes. Sonya, I would have done the same thing. Absolutely the same thing. No evidence was lost. How do you know? Look, Sonya, you're gonna have to work with Detective Ruiz. I know. Well, filing that report is gonna affect your ability to do that. Why? Because people don't like to be ratted out to their bosses, that's why. Then they should follow procedure. You're gonna have to learn to get along without me. I can't be sweeping up after you forever. What do you mean? Well, there's a gal up in Gainesville asked me to show a couple of horses for her, and I think I'm gonna do it. And Carmen wants to travel. She wants to go to Paris. I don't want to go to France. I'd go to England in a heartbeat. I'd like to see their big old clock they got. Wait, are you... You're gonna retire? Well, yeah, I can't do this forever. What about me? You'll be all right. You'll be all right. I just asked for the paperwork, that's all. (KNOCK AT DOOR) We got something. What do we got? Son of a bitch knew there were cameras. Sure it's him? Timing is spot-on. So did you run the plate? Yes, sir. HANK: That's Daniel Frye. What, you know him? Who's that? Dick-wad reporter. El Paso Times. I thought you were across the border. Just got back. You're wasting your life on that beat. You know that, right'? I'm wasting my life, huh? Lei me guess. Some Mexican shot another Mexican? Weird. No. I was meeting a woman who helps pregnant girls over the border. It's for my piece on anchor babies. You know, like the... I don't know, and I deeply don't care. And guess what, neither do the 15 other people that read this rag. Well, I care. That's great. Sherry is looking for you. You have a deadline. Sherry can eat me. Piece is on her desk. Where were you? Down the street, reporting. Drinking, you mean? Are you my mother, Adriana? No. That's right. You're just a little cub reporter. Let's see, I've written for the New York Post, the Houston Chronicle... I know. So don't tell me how 10 deal with a goddamn editor. Got it? Fine. Good luck with your Mexican baby story. Sounds fascinating. (ALARM BEEPS) (RATTLING) Come on. What the hell? Oh, shit. (EXHALES) (TIRES SQUEAL) Daniel Frye's not answering. What's his story? Pillhead. He's been arrested for battery. He organized enough to freeze a girl for a year and slice a judge in half? Well, it was his car on the bridge. What's going on? OFFICER: We have a car rigged with a bomb. A black BMW? Affirmative. Bomb squads got it under control. Excuse me. Excuse us, sir. Officer! Ma'am, fall back, please. The car belongs to Daniel Frye. He's wanted in connection with a double homicide. He's the one who called it in. He's trapped in there. I need to speak... Ma'am, please. This is as far as you go. Call him again. Just call him again. (WHIMPERS) Hey! Hey! The bomb is in the... It's in the back seat. It's ticking. It's going. Stay calm! Stay calm. Okay, but you gotta go. It started, it won't stop. It's very important that you don't move. I'm not gonna move. Just hurry. Windows wired in. Possible motion control activation. Let's get the horoscope in there and take a look. DANIEL: Oh, my God. Just go faster! Just a little faster, please! (CELL PHONE RINGS) Hi. Hello. Daniel. Just please help me get out of the car. Detective Sonya Cross. Were you on the Bridge of the Americas last night? What? What? Were you on the bridge, yes or no? Uh... No, I was here all day. I don't know... I'm not sure how that's gonna help me get out of the car. Do you know Judge Gates? Uh... Who? Judge Lorraine Gates. (STAMERING) Just from, like, cases and stuff. What cases? Oh, my God. It doesn't matter what cases. Please' you got to... You have to tell them that the ticker, it just keeps going. Yeah, yeah, yeah, put that thing in. Put it in. So, yeah. Oh, my God. How about Cristina Fuentes? I am so screwed. Daniel, this is important. Important? I'm about to get my ass blown up. Can you please stop asking me questions about a judge? Thank you. Have you written about Judge Gates? Oh, my God. Um, yes, at some point I'm sure I have, but... When? Stop asking me questions and please just help them! You got to get me out of this car. (BEEPING) The... The timer just jumped a minute. Hey, the timer just... Abort. The timer just jumped a minute. Fall back. No, no, no, no! Don't. Wait, wait, wait. Bring it back! Wait. Excuse... Don't leave me. Wait, you have to tell them that there's still time. No, no, no! Hey! Hey, you tell them to come back here right goddamn now! He's sitting on a bomb. No one can help him. So he'll tell me the truth. Daniel, you must speak to me. There's still time. There's still... Do you hear me? You must talk to me. Yes? Everything will just stop. The body will feel no pain. Are you sure? Don't look at the clock. Do you know your car was used to dump two bodies on the bridge? No. I need you to focus. Who would do this to you? I've screwed... I've screwed over so many people. When? Recently? I'm not ready to die. I'm just... I'm just not ready to die. Don't look at the timer. Okay. MAN 1: Fire in the hole! MAN 2: That's it! Cover up! Fall down! (CHIMES) (SOBS) (PANTING) Frye's? No, ma'am. It was rigged into the bomb. There's a message. DISTORTED VOICE: There are five murders a year in El Paso. In Juarez, thousands. Why? Why is one dead white woman more important than so many dead just across the bridge? How long can El Paso look away? We've got some interesting times ahead. This is only me beginning;.
