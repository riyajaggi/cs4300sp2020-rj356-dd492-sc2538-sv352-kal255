 You took my whole life away. MARCO: I know Jill Tate. We had an affair while I was friends with David. SONYA: Were you still wit her when she died in the hit-and-run? MARCO: Yes. SONYA: You're the man across the bridge. KENNETH: Tired? ALMA: Not really. KENNETH: Me neither. (Kenneth breathing heavily) (Heart beating slowly) (Panting) KENNETH: Where's my son? My son? (Screaming) ♪ Until I'm one ♪ ♪ With you ♪ ♪ My heart ♪ ♪ Shall not ♪ ♪ Pass through ♪ ♪ Our love will be mistaken. ♪ (Sirens wailing) (Sighs) ROBLES: Marco. SONYA: We know what he looks like. ROBLES: Has your fancy American task force arrested him yet? No, they haven't. SONYA: He's not done. MARCO: I know. SONYA: How does this Juarez playboy fit in to this? MARCO: Santiago Sol was a suspect in the hit-and-run accident that killed Tate's wife on the bridge. She told me she loved me, and... she wanted to be with me but it was nothing to me. SONYA: You used her for sex? MARCO: No. SONYA: You loved her? MARCO: No. SONYA: Well, you should've told her that. MARCO: Oh, she believed what she wanted to believe. SONYA: That's 'cause you were lying to her. (Marco groans) (Mumbles in Spanish) MARCO: Sonya, not everything is black and white. SONYA: What if he knows? MARCO: No. That's not possible. We were friends. I was at their funeral with him. He did not know. SONYA: What if he knows now. What if he knows now and he didn't kill you when he had the chance... because he's planning something else. I'm gonna go home. (Bird cooing softly) CHARLOTTE: Cesar? Hey, there, what are you doing out? (grunts) GRACIELA: Where's Ray? CHARLOTTE: I don't know. GRACIELA: Start with the face. (Gasps) CHARLOTTE: Thank you. CESAR: I had no choice. CHARLOTTE: What do we do now? She won't pick up. SONYA: When was the last time you spoke with her? MARCO: Days. I have a bad feeling. SONYA: What about Gus? MARCO: Oh, he's not picking up either. (Speaks Spanish) ZINA: Booh! (Gus laughs) GUS: Zina, hi. You scared me. ZINA: Something wrong? GUS: No, you... you just.. well, yeah, it's just... just.. I thought you said you were still in, uh, out of town and, that's why we couldn't meet until later? ZINA: Huh. GUS: You said you were still In Laredo. - ZINA: I did? - GUS: Yeah. (Chuckles) Are you messing with me? I... I have the text. ZINA: Um, that's not me, Gus. That's my old cell number. We haven't texted since I moved. Hopefully, you didn't tell this girl too much. GUS: Wait, so.. we are not meeting later? ZINA: Um, no. GUS: Okay, uh.. I... I have to go. MARCO: Alma?! Alma?! (Mutters) (Speaks Spanish) (Grunting) (Yells) SONYA: Maybe they're out. MARCO: At this hour? Where would they be? Rosario... Uh, okay. (Sighs) Okay. No, no, no, no... They're with Alma. She picked them up an hour ago. SONYA: That's good. Is it hard to sleep next to the same person every night? MARCO: Not now, Sonya. I'm trying to find Alma and my kids, all right? I need your help. SONYA: I'm sorry. Tell me about David Tate. MARCO: Oh, he.. he wanted to make a difference. Kept trying to open an investigation on the dead girls of Juarez. SONYA: What happened? MARCO: His bosses shut us down. SONYA: Oh. Was he good at his job? (Marco sighs) MARCO: Very. By then, the accident happened and... he changed. SONYA: So he's gonna be good at this. MARCO: What... what does that mean? SONYA: Whatever he's planning next, he won't make mistakes. MARCO: Did you really have to say that right now? SONYA: It's the truth. MARCO: That is the problem, Sonya! Why can't you just tell people what they want to hear? SONYA: What do you want to hear? MARCO: I want to hear my family's gonna be okay. I really need to believe that right now. SONYA: Okay, okay MARCO: All right. (Phone vibrating) MARCO: It's her. Alma? KENNETH: Hello, Marco. It's been a long time. MARCO: Where is my family? KENNETH: You have a beautiful family, Marco. It's hard to imagine why a man would just throw that away MARCO: Son of a bitch. I'm... I'm gonna kill you. KENNETH: Well, maybe you'll get that chance. MARCO: Where are they? KENNETH: With me. (Taps table) Who wants to have some fun? (Girls laugh) ALMA: Is everything okay? KENNETH: Oh, yeah, it was just work. You sure you don't want to call your husband and let him know where you are? ALMA: No. KENNETH: I got you this.. (Alma chuckles) And this. (Whispers): You look beautiful. (Grunts) He has them! BOB: Did you come all this way to watch her work? LINDER: No. BOB: I would. What's on your mind, Steven? LINDER: I need to talk to you. BOB: Okay. I find that work helps the tongue. Give it a shot. (Chickens clucking) LINDER: Yeah. Yeah, that feels good. BOB: Hey. What's on your mind? LINDER: I killed a man. BOB: Okay. LINDER: Are you gonna tell me I sinned. BOB: Depends on the situation. As we both know, sinning supposes a belief in A higher power. Which you lack, Steven. LINDER: Yes, I do. BOB: This man you killed, was he a good man or was he a bad man? LINDER: He carried this. - BOB: Well, that looks like... - LINDER: That's skin. That's human skin. BOB: Who was this man? LINDER: He was Eva's boyfriend. BOB: Hector? She's told me about him. Where's the body? LINDER: I took it out to the desert to bury it... and the funniest thing happened. This man came and took it from me. BOB: Well, that's a good thing LINDER: Well, that's... that's all you're gonna say? BOB: I think you're in the clear, Steven. LINDER: What do I tell Eva? BOB: The truth. LINDER: Oh, she's a good woman. BOB: Yes, she is. Special. LINDER: That's right. Bob, I've been thinkin about her in a special way. BOB: That's natural, Steven. Let's discuss this over a ham salad. LINDER: I'm so glad you said that. I've been so hungry of late. BOB: That happens after such things. My first kill, I couldn't get enough cheeseburgers. KENNETH: I used to come here with my family. ALMA: What was your son's name? KENNETH: Caleb. He used to put rocks on that slide. That was his thing, you know? That and... Legos. Made him totally happy. ALMA: How did it happen? (Kenneth sighs) KENNETH: A car accident. ALMA: We don't have to talk about this. KENNETH: Oh, it's okay. (Sighs) Feels good to talk about it. Especially with you. It made me a different person. I... I was mad... at the world. I'd see... happy families on the street and.. I'd wish bad things on them. ALMA: That must be terrible. KENNETH: I still have that anger. Work on it every day. ALMA: I can't imagine losing a child like that. KENNETH: I hope you never do. ALMA: Yeah. KENNETH: Well, uh.. let's get the girls something to eat, and, uh, I'll show you the surprise. ALMA: Okay. Hey. SONYA: Gus! (Marco speaks Spanish) GUS: Okay. - MARCO: You always pick it up! Always. - GUS: Okay. What is wrong? Where is Alma and the girls? MARCO: We don't know. SONYA: Gus, do you know a person named Kenneth Hasting? GUS: Mr. Hasting? The guy who works with Alma? MARCO: What? GUS: At the university. Why are you asking about him? MARCO: Okay, listen to me. I need to know if Alma said anything about leaving. GUS: No. And Sophia and Lilly? I thought you said you had the guy. MARCO: We were wrong. (Phone ringing) SONYA: Sonya Cross. MARCO: Has Kenneth been in my house? GUS: I... I don't know. Maybe. MARCO: You should have told me that, Gus. GUS: I know, it's... she asked me not to. (Marco sighs) Are you sure it's the same guy? MARCO: Yes. GUS: Are they going to be okay? MARCO: I don't know. SONYA: They found Hasting's apartment. I'm taking you to the station. It's not safe for you here, all right? Let's go. WADE: Hey. He had this entire building wired to blow. - MARCO: Any sign of him? - WADE: Nothing yet. Listen. We're gonna get this guy, and we're gonna get your wife and kids back. COOPER: Hey. This guy had a lot of free time on his hands. SONYA: What you got? COOPER: See for yourself. COOPER: Watch your step. KENNETH: Ah. ALMA: Is this the surprise? KENNETH: No, I've been working on this for a long time. Used to be an old hunting cabin. You're not gonna believe what I've done. I got two hamsters. Who wants to feed 'em first? (girls giggling) Come on. You coming? ALMA: Yeah. KENNETH: Come on. Okay. - No peeking. - ALMA: Oh. Okay (Kenneth chuckles) KENNETH: Here we go. (Alma chuckles) - No peeking. - ALMA: Okay. KENNETH: Promise? ALMA: I promise. KENNETH: Girls, tell your mommy to keep her eyes shut. This is a very big surprise. ALMA: I really don't want to play this game anymore. You're scaring the girls. (Light metallic rattling) KENNETH: Almost. Almost. Hold out your hand. ALMA: Hmm. KENNETH: Hold out your hand. Okay. Now, hold on to this very tight. Open your eyes. ALMA: Oh, God KENNETH: Now, careful. Take your hand off that lever, you only have five seconds to say good-bye to your daughters. Surprise. ALMA: Oh, God. No, no, no, no, no Stop! (shouts) No wait!

Don't leave us here! Kenneth. Don't go! Don't go! (Engine starts) Oh, God. BOB: Lies are like little black butterflies, Steven. They cling to you till you speak the truth... and you set them free. Eva, Steven has something he'd like to tell you. EVA: Hi. LINDER: Hello, Eva. Uh, Bob, can we have a minute, please? BOB: Of course. (Linder sighs) LINDER: How you doing? EVA: Okay. LINDER: Listen, I... I need to.. tell you something. EVA: Yes? LINDER: Hector's dead. EVA: How? LINDER: He attacked me in my home, and I didn't have a choice. (Sighs) You loved him. (Clears throat) EVA: I shouldn't have. LINDER: I'm sorry, Eva. SONYA: He was meticulous. It's got to be in there. GUS: Dad. MARCO: What is it, Gus? GUS: Did you find them? MARCO: No, not yet. I mean, look, we're busy right now, all right. GUS: I... I know, but... but just wait, okay. SONYA: Did you remember something about Kenneth? GUS: No, it... it's about Zina MARCO: Z... Zina? GUS: Dad, it's important, - Okay?! - WADE: What is it, son? GUS: I've been texting Zina this whole time, but... but it wasn't her. SONYA: What do you mean "it wasn't her"? GUS: I ran into her this morning, but she didn't know anything. And so whoever I was texting I told them things about the case, because they said they were interested. SONYA: Let me see. You write a lot about me. GUS: I know. I... I'm sorry. SONYA: "MILF". GUS: I... it's a mom I.. SONYA: I know what it means. - I don't have children. - MARCO: Sonya, please. Come on.

MARCO: (groans) No, no, no. You didn't know. - You couldn't have known. - WADE: It's him. SONYA: He doesn't know that he ran into the real Zina this morning. MARCO: You know what, text him, say you want to meet. Go on. WADE: Let me, let me. Okay (Phone beeps) MARCO: Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. (Phone beeps) WADE: It's on.
