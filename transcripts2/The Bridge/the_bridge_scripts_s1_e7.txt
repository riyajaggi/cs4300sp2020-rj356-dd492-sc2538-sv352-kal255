 Previously on “The Bridge”…  — What’s on the other end ?
 — A crazy, psychotic bitch.
 — You want me to deal with her.
 — If everything checks out,
 — it’ll be just like it was with Karl, but with Ray.
 — I want to get something going down here.
 — You know what I mean ?
 — I do.
— Sweet.
 — Did you call in unit ?
— No.
 — Is that a real police cruiser ?
 — No. Guy must’ve bought an ’02 Crow Vic
 — at auction and tricked it up
 — to look like one.
 — The lab’s all over it.
— Gina heard her father
 — talking to someone before the murder.
 — You’re thinking that the killer was a patient, right ?
 — Maybe.
 — What about his cheeks ? Full ? Hollow ?
 — It was dark. I was hiding, and I only saw him for a second.
 — Female, Caucasian
 — 15 years old, black and white sweater…
 — Gina.
 — Gina.
 — Hey ! Okay…
 — He’s watching us.
 — Are you all right ?
 — I’m digging the whole
 — Erykah Badu thing you got going.
 — The turban.
 — What do you want ?
 — Ah, I thought it would be nice doing this in person you know,
 — seeing it’s the ﬁrst time and all.
 — What else do yo want ?
 — I’m guessing I, uh…
 — checked out with the cowboy lawyer ?
 — Monte’s very thorough.
 — Okay. So I check out.
 — I’d like my money now, please.
 — Something wrong ?
— I’m good.
 — Then we’re done.
— Yeah, well, you know…
 — I was thinking about getting a little two-way commerce going.
 — It’s a shame to see that tunnel running one way.
 — What do you have in mind ?
 — AR-15s. Say, 50 to start.
 — We go from there.
 — That’s not an easy weapon to get right now.
 — No shit.
 — So what do you say ?
 — I got a great connect.
 — I can deliver this week.
 — Do you have an opinion about oral sex ?
 — Uh, yeah. It’s, uh… it’s cool.
 — I prefer it.
 — Some ladies do.
 — This will be our arrangement, moving forward.
 — So is that a yes on the guns ?
 — Depende.
 — Is this a cartel thing ?
 — Okay, then.
 — What are you doing ?
 — Call log.
 — Stolen vehicle reports from the past ﬁve years.
 — How long have you been up ?
 — The killer got that car somewhere.
 — Yeah, maybe here, maybe in Dallas, maybe Chicago.
 — You know, there’s only so much information you can process.
 — Well, do you have better idea ?
 — You like details, huh ? Just like the killer.
 — It’s how I work.
 — Maybe you should listen to your gut sometimes.
 — I’m going in to look at that car again.
 — Don’t leave that up there.
 — Oh, yeah. Sorry.
 — Think I’m gonna go home and talk to Alma.
 — She’s not gonna let you back into the house.
 — Your gut should tell you that.
 — Yeah, maybe I should ﬁnd a hotel, huh ?
 — What’s wrong with the couch ?
 — Nothing. Yep. Oh, hold on.
 — I almost forgot. Here.
 — What’s that for ?
 — For the ﬂowers.
 — For Kitty. See, I borrowed some money.
 — So I’m paying you back.
 — Okay. Thank you.
 — Yeah. Thank you.
 — What’s the ﬁrst thing you’re gonna eat
 — when these things come off ?
 — Don’t talk. Hold on.
 — I’m working the case of a lifetime.
 — Yeah, all right.
 — I’m working with task force.
 — All right.
 — Conﬁdential stuff, can’t… tell you about it.
 — All righty.
 — Hello ?
— Detective Cross ?
 — Yes, I’m here.
— I think I found it.
 — The car was purchased at…
 — I got something on the car.
 — Where’s Marco at ?
 — He went home to argue with his wife.
 — Right. What about the car ?
 — They pulled three digits of a VIN from the engine block.
 — Doesn’t match any stolen Crown Vics.
 — Go on.
 — But I have a partial match on a car
 — that was sold at auction
 — in Las Cruces ﬁve years ago.
 — I’ve been on the phone with the auction house all morning.
 — They dug up the sale.
 — Is there a name ?

 — Well, that’s worth a look.
 — Sorry, I’m late.
 — How’s things at home ?
 — Bad. Maybe worse.
 — Sorry to hear that.
 — It is what it is.
 — Why don’t you stick with Sonya.
 — She’s gonna follow up a dicey lead out in the desert.
 — Copy that.
 — Hey, baby.
— What are you doing ?
 — I’m investigating the drain.
 — You’re my pool boy now ?
 — Well, I was looking for summer work, ma’am.
 — Did you see her ?
— Yeah. And I got the money.
 — Did she say anything else ?
 — Nope.
 — This is the place.
 — This guy has record ?
 — Marco.
 — El Paso PD. Open the door !
 — El Paso PD, search warrant.
 — Anybody home ?
 — Is anybody here ?
 — What the hell is this ?
 — What’s that ?

 — By Jackson Childress.
 — What the hell ?
 — This is our guy.
 — We don’t have to do this.
 — Well…
 — it’s what we both want, right ?
 — But you’re married.
 — We could wait… and do it right.
 — What do you mean ?
 — If you want to get a divorce, get a divorce.
 — Well, that’s complicated.
 — Yeah. A little.
 — I think he’s off his meds.
 — Oh, shit. Cops.
 — Chapter Nine:
 — On the Extraterrestrial Origins of the Mexican people’s.
 — He’s insane.
 — Look. He’s been to Mexico.
 — Many times he calls them his “missions”.
 — Well, I think we should bring in the task force.
 — No. Just Hank. He’s on his way.
 — Last time we broadcast something, he was listening.
 — We pull back and wait for him to come.
 — I was surprised you were willing to meet me during the day.
 — Well, everything’s changing.
 — Shell of the egg is breaking.
 — You have another job for me ?
— I do.

— Her name is Sar Vega.
 — She’s my daughter.
 — She dropped out of school. She lost her way.
 — Do you want me to take her ?
 — Take her to Bob’s ? Against her will ?

 — I’m a conduit.
 — I don’t know what else to do.
 — Okay, don’t cry.
 — All right, I’ll do it.
 — Easy. Easy, easy
 — Don’t… don’t be scared.
 — Your mother sent me.
— What the hell ?
 — She wants a bette life for you. So do I.
 — I know who you are.
 — You’re my mother’s stupid gringo coyote.
 — Well, I don’t consider myself…
 — I met you at my quinceañera, idiot.
 — Oh, yeah.
 — My boyfriend’s gonna kill you
 — for talking to me.
 — Yeah, well, I’m sure that your boyfriend’s a very scary person,
 — and he’s welcome to try. But you need to come with me.
 — No, no.
 — Damn it. Oh, shit.
 — I don’t want to go, okay ?
 — So tell my mom to stop this shit, okay ?
 — I am trying to help you.
 — Okay.

 — Source told me the police are looking at him,
 — I’m not sure what’s up
 — It’s not what I expected…
 — What do you mean ?
 — What’s the connection between him and Gedman ?
 — Or… the shrinker or Marco Ruiz,
 — Body 23, me even.
 — We don’t know yet.
 — There are no coincidences with this guy.
 — Come on, let’s go to his house.
 — Tell you what, you go.
 — I don’t know if you’ve noticed but my brain ain’t right.
 — I can’t write a sentence to save my life, and I got…
 — I got this mother of a headache that won’t go away.
 — My body’s basically giving me
the middle ﬁnger for gettin clean.
 — Maybe you should go to see a doctor.
 — Oh, yeah, why so he tell me
 — I’m an alcoholic drug addict that’s all broken.
 — No, thanks.
 — Frye, this is the story.
 — I know…
 — I know.
 — It’s your story now. Go get them, tiger.
 — Three-second rule. You can have it.
 — We go in pairs, trailer by trailer.
 — Make sure he ain’t hiding in one of these tuna cans.
 — Yes, sir.
 — The last time we called the cavalry,
 — a little girl got killed, remember that
 — Oh, gracias.
 — Thank you.
— De nada.
 — Hank…
— Don’t worry about it.
 — Deputy Stokes, what are you doing here ?
 — I got a call about that truck in the middle of the road.
 — What’s going on ?
 — Hey, man.
 — Uh, we got the suspect in the park here.
 — The Bridge Butcher ?
 — Manny, do me a favor.
 — Secure the entrance and the trucks, all right ?
 — You got it.
 — Good deal.Let’s go.
 — Good morning.
 — Time to shine.
 — El Paso PD,open the door.
 — Ma’am, is anyone else in there with you
 — No, ma’am.
— All right.

 — Seabiscuit.
 — Ma’am…
— Goddamn it
 — Please go inside and lock the door.
 — Turn the music down.
 — Bath salts.
 — Man !
 — Nada.
 — Detectives.
 — I went back to the truck.
 — Found this.This is a bone saw.
 — That’s used for wild game, deer, vermin, whatnot.
 — Bag it.
— Listen.
 — I just… Detective !
 — I’ll eat your face off.
 — That sock don’t ever cover your nut sack.
 — That’s not him.
— Nope. But he knows him.
 — Says Childress through here about ten minutes ago.
 — Where was he going ?
 — North edge of the park. Bunch of vacants down there.
 — He stays in ’em when he’s having a crazy day.
 — How often is that ?
— A lot !
 — And that psycho’s armed.
 — Stay.
 — Nope, nothing. No sign of him
 — Well, if he’s on foot he’s not gonna get far in this heat.
 — Or maybe he got a car waiting ?
 — We need to get in contact with him.
 — How are we gonna do that ?
 — Call him.
 — You really think he’s gonna answer ?
 — Well, he likes the attention.
 — This is what he’s been preparing for, so…
 — Detective Ruiz !
— Yes, Deputy ?
 — You got something ?
— Uh… well… no.
 — But, uh, yeah. Yeah, I just… I got a quick question for you.
 — I don’t know if you noticed,
 — but I got my braces off this morning
 — No, I did not notice.
 — Well, the reason I bring it up…
 — Well, I was in there getting ’em popped off,
 — and while they were popping ’em off,
 — I just had the wildest, strangest, uh…
 — daydream… I think that’s what you call it.
 — Okay…
— About this case.
 — Yeah
— No, no, no, listen.
 — So
— … and basically what I was thinking
 — was that if you were the killer,
 — and you were to go to all this trouble…
 — Yeah
— … to-to do the beads,
 — and-and all these messages…
 — Shit.
 — Son of a bitch !
 — Shots ﬁred ! Shots ﬁred ! Man down !
 — Move ! Move !
 — Son of a bitch !
 — White. Brown.
 — Shit.
 — Come on, now.
 — 500 yards.Top of the hill.
 — Brown house.
 — He’s tucked against that water tower.
 — He’s back in his goddamn house.
 — Shit, shit.
 — Damn it, Stokes.
 — Mcnutt Road, north end of the trailer park. Ofﬁcer down.
 — Forget it !… Let’s… go get him.
 — SWAT’s gonna be here in 20 min.
 — He’ll be gone by them.
 — So let’s go get him !
 — Forget the SWAT !
 — Jack.
 — You’re on with jack ?
 — I got him !
 — Okay, Marco…
 — Come on.
 — Be careful !
 — I’ll keep him distracted.
 — I need you to listen to me.
 — Yeah, I-I don’t know about that.
 — I see you.
 — I could kill you.
 — Almost isn’t sporting, is it ?
 — It’s over.
 — Yeah, yeah, the end is already determined.
 — You killed a cop, that means cops are coming to kill you.
 — Well, you invaded my land.
 — Maybe you got it backwards.
 — A SWAT team’s on their way.
 — Yeah. I’m sure they are.
 — But they’re late. I’m in control.
 — Listen, you want to tell your story ?
 — This is not the way to do it.
 — They will kill you.
 — I can still stop them.
 — All right, boss. How we gonna do this ?
 — She’s talking to him on the phone.
 — We’re gonna give her ﬁve minutes.
 — You think she’s gonna talk him out of anything ?
 — Five minutes.
 — Yes, sir.
 — Why’d you stop talking, Jack ?
 — Would it help if you could see me ?
 — Mmh ? Oh, I don’t know. Yeah, sure.
 — Tell me why, Jack.
— Why ?
 — Why ? Because I am the truth.
 — Truth ?
 — El Paso del Norte has been falsely split by borders,
 — by… by cultures, by history.
 — What you’re doin’ won’t change that.
 — I can try.
 — Is that what you’re doing…
 — on your missions ?
 — Impressive.
 — Well, you know, parasite, host, same thing.
 — Why did you kill so many people, Jack ?
 — There is a war happening here at the border.
 — And no one seems to know about it.
 — I want the truth to come out.
 — You still have time.
 — All institutions eat themselves eventually.
 — You’re smart, you know that.
 — Hi there.
 — Put your gun down.
 — You know, I like to kill up close.
 — I will shoot you.
 — I believe you will.
 — Sonya !
 — Stay there !
 — Son of a bitch.
 — Come on !
 — You okay, Sonya ?
 — Hank ! Is she all right ?
 — I’m not asking about you !
 — She’s all right.
 — Is she okay ?
 — She’s all right.
 — Hey. How are you ?
 — Sore, I can’t breathe.
 — That was…
 — We got him. It’s over.
 — Maybe.
 — What do you mean ? What’s wrong ?
 — He’s insane.
 — Yes, okay. And ?
 — I’m just not sure that the man who planned all this is insane.
 — We have the bone saw and the car.
 — You saw the writing in this book.
 — It’s him.
 — Ofﬁcer.
 — Could’ve run.
 — Why’d you stay to shoot ?
 — The job wasn’t done.
 — What ?
 — I meant to kill the Mexican.
 — It’s okay. Don’t mind me.
 — Is there something wrong, Senorita ?
 — Uh, here.
 — What’s this ?
 — That’s you salary.
 — And that’s your cut of the tunnel.
 — It’s okay.
— We’re partners.
 — I assume you didn’t have this raise with Karl.
 — No.
 — Is there something else, Señora ?
 — Do you think I’m doing the right thing ?
 — I think you’re doing the only thing.
 — How long is your friend staying ?
 — Ray ?
 — I don’t know.
 — He’s helping me deal with Graciela.
 — I heard.
 — Do you trust him ?
 — I think I do. Why ?
 — It’s nothing.
 — We’re partners. Say it.
 — I don’t think it’s such a good idea
 — to let him deal with Graciela.
 — Señora, her and Karl had a way of controlling.
 — I’ll tell Ray to be careful.
 — Good night, Caesar.
 — Traveling through…
 — “Prairie Fire”.
 — Stokes was a moron,
 — but he didn’t deserve to get his head blowed off.
 — Take a couple days.
 — Yes, sir.
 — We found him. That’s what matters.
 — Is it ?
 — Yep
 — That dude is gonna plead insanity
 — and spends the rest of his life beating off and knitting socks.
 — Well, that’s what happens, that’s what happens.
 — Sonya should’ve shot him between the eyes.
 — Yeah, and that would’ve made him dead.
 — I don’t see the problem with that, Hank.
 — Give it 15 years.
 — Oh, God.
 — Can I trust you ?
— Of course, baby.
 — Can I trust you ?
 — Come inside me.
 — You sure ?
 — No, not better.
 — I would, uh… I would deﬁnitely classify it as worse, actually.
 — Well, yeah, of course I’ll help you ﬁle your story.
