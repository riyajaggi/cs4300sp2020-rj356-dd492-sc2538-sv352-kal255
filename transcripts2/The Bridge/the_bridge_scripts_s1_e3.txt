Nothing's gonna happen to you. Do what she says and you'll be fine. You're late. What are we doing here? Transferring the property out of your name. I just need your signature. Shall we? Hey. _ Jaime, eat less, move more. Can you get your tool, Jaime? Sí. Okay, let's do this thing. I have to use the bathroom. Okay. Use the one upstairs. This one leaks. It does? Yes, it does.

Cesar? God, what the hell?! What did you tell the police? Nothing. I... You're lying, Chip. No, please, I swear. I don't like liars. No, just... No machete. I didn't tell 'em anything! I... _ _ _ _ _ Eh? _ _ What did you do to Chip? He spoke to the cops. I-I want to leave. Now. You can't. Phone, please. Passcode. 1-2-3-4. That's a weak passcode. Make sure Jaime's okay.

Should I get the locals to pick him up? No, you let him run. We'll track the money. Just keep your eyes on the prize, Pete. She's there. Looks like two more. She has her book. Never without it. I don't follow. The keys to the kingdom. Next stop, Fausto Galvan. What now? You live your life. We're done. Senora? - Police? - Policía. What have you done? Nothing. You're lying.

None for you. Why is that? I saved your life today... and you still don't trust me? How'd you find me? I told you, I did a favor for someone. Who? Sebastian Cerisola. His daughter got into some trouble and I... He works for Fausto. How can I trust you? Because I work for the state of Chihuahua. _ I'm your friend, Sonya. Don't you see what's happening? That war is finally here, in the U.S., and the border won't be able to stop it. We need to get everyone responsible... - Fausto, Sebastian, Eleanor. - Yes... we do.
