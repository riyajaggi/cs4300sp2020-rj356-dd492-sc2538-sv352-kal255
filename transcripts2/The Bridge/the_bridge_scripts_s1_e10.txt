 Previously on The Bridge... MARCO: Where's my family? SONYA: Gus, do you know a person named Kenneth Hasting? GUS: Mr. Hasting? The guy who works with Alma? KENNETH: You have a beautiful family, Marco. MARCO: Where are they? KENNETH: With me. Hold on to this very tight. ALMA: Oh, God. KENNETH: Now, careful. Take your hand off that lever,

 you only have five seconds to say good-bye to your daughters. ADRIANA: Daniel Frye. GUS: Why would Mr. Hasting do this? SONYA: It doesn't make sense. GUS: What? GUS: Where are we going? Why are you doing this? KENNETH: How old are you? GUS: Nineteen. (Sniffles) KENNETH: Caleb would have been 17. You could have been friends. Caleb and Gus. (Gus sniffles)

 Everything could have been... different. GUS: What are you going to do? KENNETH: To you? GUS: Yes. KENNETH: For Caleb, it was the sins of the mother. For you, the father. GUS: He's a good person. KENNETH: Is he a good dad? (Gus sobs softly) GUS: He wants to be. KENNETH: And it's the thought that counts, right?

SONYA: Marco. He took Gus. Gray sedan. 2-E-O. 2-E-O. WADE: 2-E-O. MARCO: Shh. Take it easy. WADE: I'll stay with her. We're working on where he could've taken your son. - MARCO: How did this happen? - WADE: I don't know! We're gonna find him. Come on. ADRIANA: Daniel! So much for the wagon, huh. FRYE: Oops. (Frye scoffs) It's, uh... "Comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable." ADRIANA: You can't just go AWOL. - FRYE: You ever heard of it? - ADRIANA: I've heard it. FRYE: A good journalist... comforts the afflicted and afflicts the comfortable. Finley Peter Dunne, he said that. I wrote this when I was... (blows raspberry) twenty. ADRIANA: So be a good journalist. Quit this shit. You were doing well. (Frye sighs) (Chuckles) FRYE: You know why I ended up in my car with that bomb? ADRIANA: No. FRYE: I helped kill David Tate's wife and kid. ADRIANA: Explain. FRYE: Six years ago... and I was, uh... I was hanging out with Santi Sol Jr. And we needed more coke, so he went back across the bridge to get some. He clipped that woman's car. He just kept going. ADRIANA: He did, not you. FRYE: Yeah, but this... this is the part where I become a shitty human being. See, instead of, say, I don't know, testifying, instead of comforting the afflicted, I just let Santi Jr.'s dad buy me off. He just came to me one day and he said, "Daniel, I have a big cock, I have a newspaper in Houston. I want you to work for me." - ADRIANA: And you said yes. - FRYE: I said yes. I said yes so fa... I didn't even hesitate. I said yes in two seconds flat. ADRIANA: That's why Santi pretended he didn't know you. FRYE: Oh, yeah? He big-timed me? (Scoffs) Cooze. ADRIANA: I hate talking to you when you're drunk. (Frye clears throat, coughs) FRYE: Oh, well. ADRIANA: You can change. FRYE: I tried... but obviously, I can't. ADRIANA: There's a meeting tomorrow, 7:00 a.m., down the street. FRYE: 12 Steps can suck my dick. ADRIANA: Let people help you. Meet me. I'll go with you. FRYE: You might be my only real friend. (Chuckles ruefully) ADRIANA: That's pathetic. 7:00 a.m. (Sobbing) GUS: You texted me saying you were Zina. KENNETH: Right. GUS: And you told me to give him another chance. KENNETH: I did. (Gus sobbing) GUS: So I do not understand. (Stun gun crackling) KENNETH: Neither did Caleb. (Kenneth clears throat) (Indistinct radio transmission) - MARCO: Alma. - ALMA: Marco. MARCO: Alma... MARCO: Alma... DOCTOR: You're lucky to be alive. That laceration is long, but it didn't damage any of the organs. SONYA: And my arm? DOCTOR: You fractured the radius. Badly. SONYA: I can't move it. DOCTOR: Can you feel it? That's just the swelling. How's the pain? SONYA: It's there. - KITTY: Hey. - SONYA: Hey. KITTY: We brought you some things. WADE: What's the prognosis? DOCTOR: Well, she's gonna need surgery on the arm. SONYA: That's not possible anytime soon. DOCTOR: You can't leave Sonya. You nearly died. SONYA: I thought you said I was lucky. DOCTOR: I said lucky to be alive. WADE: Doc, could we have a minute, please? - DOCTOR: Sure. - WADE: All right. KITTY: You know, maybe you ought to listen to her. SONYA: Anything on Gus? WADE: Nope. Marco's getting Alma somewhere safe. SONYA: Can you help me with these? KITTY: Sure, babe. Sit yourself down. WADE: You should stay here. SONYA: You know I can't do that. Gus is alive. WADE: Why do you say that? SONYA: He wants Marco to suffer. He wants to draw it out. KITTY: Vicodin. It-it's good. (Sonya groaning) NICK: Okay. Okay, thanks, Shaun, for trusting us with that. We have a new face with us this morning. FRYE: You want me to do... do the whole thing? - NICK: Yeah, yeah. - FRYE: My God. (Laughs, snorts) Um... okay. My name is Daniel. If you almost call me Dan, then I'll kill you. Stripes. Um, thank you for telling me that deeply depressing story, Shaun. You actually make me feel really good about myself, so that was awesome. Um, I had my last drink about 90 minutes ago and it was delicious. (Laughs) (Sighs) Okay. (Sighs) Um... (Sniffs) (Crying) I don't know how you guys do what you do. It just seems kind of impossible to me. I tried. I try so hard, and then just, I get so far and then shit the bed and something happens, and I just get hammered, and life is so much better when you're hammered. (Groans) But I have... I have cool people in my life who think I can change. I see a lot of cool people... thank you... who let me believe in myself. (Clears throat) So, thanks for that. Oh, God. (Clears throat, sniffles) So, whatever. I don't have a watch or anything, but, uh, look. It is 8:22... and, uh, from this point on I'm gonna give it a shot. I don't know how it's gonna go, but... shit, I'll give it a shot. (All clapping) KENNETH: How touching that all was. (Frye yells) (Engine revving, tires squeal) COOPER: All right, gang. This is the haul from David Tate's apartment. One pile per victim. Be quick, but be diligent. MARCO: How does that help my son? COOPER: We know he's methodical. If there's a plan for your boy, it's in here somewhere. MARCO: You don't know that. COOPER: I know it's our best bet. SONYA: Anything on the license plate? COOPER: No, ma'am, not yet. - You okay? - SONYA: Yeah. COOPER: All right. Got Daniel Frye's car bomb here. Gedman's murder. Dr. Meadow's murder. MARCO: You're bleeding. SONYA: Yes. MARCO: Everything is coming apart. (Sighs) SONYA: I'm sorry about Gus. I'm sorry I couldn't protect him. MARCO: There was nothing you could do. SONYA: But it was... It was my job, and you asked me to keep him safe, and I, and I didn't... I'm sorry. I tried. WADE: (Snaps his fingers) Come here. SONYA: What are these? COOPER: These are documents we can't connect... WADE: When did you last sleep? MARCO: Uh, who knows? WADE: You're not yourself. MARCO: I'm fine. WADE: I'm required to ask. Are you sure you don't need to step away? What would you do if someone had your son? SONYA: Uniforms found the car. WADE: Go. Go. Go, go, go, go. MARCO: No, no, no, no, no. OFFICER: Gravedigger found it out here an hour ago. - SONYA: Nothing inside? - OFFICER: Manual, receipts, a few things in the glove box. SONYA: Marco! Marco. It's not him. It's not Gus. It's just a grave! He's playing with you. MARCO: I am a man. A father. This is not a game! SONYA: I know. Come on, get up. (Both panting) We won't stop, okay? Let's go. (Marco grunts) RAY: Okay. Kind of a curveball. CHARLOTTE: A curve-up-my-ass ball. RAY: More like a slider then, I guess. CHARLOTTE: He left me nothing. RAY: He left you the house and land. CHARLOTTE: Kate got the money, the cars, the art, the furniture. RAY: I repeat, you got the land and the tunnel. KATE: That went super well, I thought. CHARLOTTE: You did a really good job of turning him against me, Kate. (Kate laughs) KATE: So... this one time, my dad calls me up in the middle of the night. And I-I ask him what's up, you know. He says, "Oh... it's just another day married to an idiot." That was eight years ago. Pretty sure you turned him against you. Bye, whore. RAY: Adiós, Kate. Hey. Forget her. Look at me, forget her. We've got the tunnel. Okay? We solve the Tim problem this afternoon, we put the fear of God in him, and then we'll be fine. (Indistinct conversations) ADRIANA: Lieutenant Wade? WADE: Yeah, we're kind of busy right now. ADRIANA: Daniel Frye is missing. WADE: He's an addict, right? ADRIANA: It's not like that. We were at an AA meeting, and I don't... I don't think it was him that drove his car away. WADE: Yeah? Who was it? ADRIANA: Daniel helped cover up the hit-and-run. David Tate's family. He told me. That's why he's been targeted all this time. MARCO: Parking ticket. From the morning the bodies were left on the bridge. SONYA: Not part of the plan. MARCO: This is not his apartment address. - It's something else. - SONYA: Come on. We'll call it in on the way. GUS: (Muffled) Hello? Hello? Hello? (Water splashing) (Muffled shouting) GUS: Is anybody there?! DORA: I'm sure of it. He visits one of our residents. I'd say every few weeks. - MARCO: Which resident? - DORA: Mr. Chambers. - He's probably in the parlor. - MARCO: Thank you. WALTER: He's a nice man. Warm. Kind. MARCO: Do you know who he is? WALTER: Of course. He's my father. (Marco sighs) SONYA: Walter Chambers has a home address on file. (Marco sighs) MARCO: David once said his uncle had Alzheimer's. SONYA: David Tate was here that day. Come on. (Door alarm chiming) (Chiming stops) SONYA: What are you doing? MARCO: What if we can't find him? SONYA: We will. MARCO: You can't say that. MARCO: We... hadn't really talked for years, and then suddenly he was back in my life. We just talked about... how I wasn't there for him enough. And how I'd try to... do better. (Sonya sighs) SONYA: Tate set that up, too. MARCO: Still. And now I'm gonna... and now I'm gonna lose him again? SONYA: I can't say we'll find him, but you can't say we won't. MARCO: What if he's not inside? SONYA: We'll keep looking. (Marco sighs) (Sighs heavily) SONYA: El Paso PD. Open the door! (Marco sighs) (Metallic creaking) SONYA: That's where he kept Cristina's legs. (Phone ringing) MARCO: Gus? KENNETH: No. MARCO: Jesus, David. KENNETH: He's a good-looking kid... Gus. MARCO: Leave him alone. Take it out on me. KENNETH: Well, isn't that what I'm doing? MARCO: Let me talk to him at least. KENNETH: That's not possible. MARCO: Is he alive? KENNETH: For now. (Marco sighs) I thought we'd get together. MARCO: Why are you doing this? KENNETH: Because I'm angry, and I want to talk about it. MARCO: All right. Fine. Where? KENNETH: Where are you now? MARCO: At your uncle's house. Hello? KENNETH: You actually remembered something I told you about myself. MARCO: We found the freezer. KENNETH: We? MARCO: Yes. Sonya's here with me. KENNETH: Really? How is she? Probably pretty pale. MARCO: She's fine. KENNETH: I've been meaning to ask her how she enjoyed getting to know Jack Childress. That man has some batshit theories on the border, doesn't he? MARCO: Where are we meeting, David? KENNETH: Get in your car. I'll call you in 60 seconds, give you directions. - MARCO: All right. - KENNETH: Come alone. Entirely alone. Leave her. MARCO: I will. SONYA: You can't do that. You're doing exactly what he wants. - MARCO: Give me your gun. - SONYA: No. - MARCO: Please. - SONYA: No. If you kill him, you... you're gonna end up in prison. MARCO: Sonya, I need your gun. Please. MARCO: Thank you. Don't tell anyone where I went. SONYA: What do I say? MARCO: Just... that I got a call, and, uh... I left you here. - SONYA: I can't lie to Hank. - MARCO: Oh, yes, you can. - SONYA: No, I can't. - MARCO: It's easy. (Phone ringing) Do it for me. All right? Hello? (Breathing hard) (Groans) (Water running in pipes) (Breathing hard) SONYA: I need a ride. RAY: Timbo. TIM: Ray! Char. So what are we doing here? RAY: (Chuckles) What do you mean by that? TIM: Dude. We're on freakin' Mars, right now. CHARLOTTE: We thought a remote area would be best. TIM: Okay. Where's the dinero. TIM: Whoa, whoa. Look, what-what's going on, crazies? RAY: Get on your knees. TIM: Wh...? (Tim grunts) CHARLOTTE: We found this. TIM: What the heck is it? RAY: It's a transmitter, dipshit. It was in one of those guns. TIM: Aw, no, no... That's-that's nothing. They put those things in the... at-at the factory. RAY: Don't even try. CHARLOTTE: You have no idea the shit storm you caused me. TIM: Okay, what. That lady you muff-dove come-come after you, what? RAY: I don't even know what that means. CHARLOTTE: What part of the government? TIM: Excuse me? CHARLOTTE: For whom are you an informant? (Tim scoffs) I will get in my truck, Tim, and I will run you over. - I swear. - TIM: Okay, okay, look. Look, I'm sorry, okay? Guys, I just got caught up in something. CHARLOTTE: Are you wired right now? TIM: No. No, no, no, no. No, see? They-they-they don't even know where I am. ATF, they're, like, so disorganized, it's like they-they forget about me. CHARLOTTE: The ATF? (Tim sighs) Shoot him. RAY: I thought you said we were gonna scare him. CHARLOTTE: I changed my mind. Do it. RAY: I don't think I can. We used to play kickball together. TIM: Guys, it's... come on, Char, dude, it's me. We-we-we took an RV to our prom together. RAY: He has a point. TIM: Blue satin. Big white flower in your hair. CHARLOTTE: Give it to me. RAY: Char... TIM: Wha...? No, whoa, whoa... (Gunshot, Tim and Ray yell) Please... (Gunshots) RAY: No, no! No, no, no, no, no! No, no, no, no, no, no! Oh, no! CHARLOTTE: Calm down. RAY: Calm down? You killed Tim. He was our buddy! KENNETH: How's your wife? MARCO: Don't talk about her. KENNETH: I had sex with her. Did you know that? MARCO: You're lying. KENNETH: What surprised me was the vigor. I mean, after that first kiss, she really... threw herself into it. MARCO: Where am I driving? KENNETH: It's okay that she survived. I mean, it-it wasn't her fault. MARCO: It's not Gus's fault either. KENNETH: No, but he's your son. Like Caleb was mine. MARCO: Where am I going, David? KENNETH: Franklin Mountain Park. Did you do it at my house? MARCO: Yes. KENNETH: In my bed with my wife? What was your plan? MARCO: I didn't have one. KENNETH: Did you think it was okay as long as I didn't find out? MARCO: No. KENNETH: Did you even think about telling me? MARCO: No. KENNETH: No, you just wanted what you wanted. Who cares who it hurts? MARCO: I'm getting to the park. KENNETH: Lot J, near the quarry. WADE: Hey, where's Marco? SONYA: I don't know. He got a call and left. WADE: Got a call from who? (Sonya groaning) KITTY: You don't look good. SONYA: Oh, it's-it's nothing. KITTY: Okay, come on. Sit down. Sit. You need to eat. - SONYA: I don't like bananas. - KITTY: That doesn't matter. You supposed to be on an operating table right now. And I understand why you're not, but you will be of no help to Marco and his boy if you faint or get sick or get hurt even worse. - SONYA: I need to keep looking. - KITTY: I know. SONYA: I know we're missing something. It's in those documents. I know it. KITTY: Okay. Just drink that. And then back at it. KENNETH: Well, hello there... old friend. Stop. MARCO: Where is he? (Grunting) KENNETH: Strange feeling for a cop, isn't it? To be powerless? MARCO: Daniel Frye's? KENNETH: That's some amazing detective work. MARCO: Did you kill him, too? KENNETH: Have you thought about me much? Since my... suicide? MARCO: Not much. KENNETH: You knew I was crumbling, right? After she died. A shrink had me hooked on pills. The FBI fired me. MARCO: I heard. KENNETH: But not one phone call. MARCO: We were... out of touch. KENNETH: Funny how that happens. Get in the car. MARCO: She chose me, David. All of this because she chose me? KENNETH: Yes. MARCO: You killed all these people because your wife left you? KENNETH: She was taken from me. MARCO: You're not the first person to lose everything. Over there it happens every day! People have their lives ripped away from them. It doesn't make them killers. KENNETH: Maybe I'm special. MARCO: You... you're not. KENNETH: Get rid of you phone. You have a gun? (Marco sighs) MARCO: Yes. KENNETH: Good. I'll drive. (Car door closes) (Muffled yelling) Sync and corrected by Elderfel www.addic7ed.com
