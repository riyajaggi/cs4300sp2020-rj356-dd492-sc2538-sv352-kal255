 MARCO: Are you hurt? GINA: I saw him. I saw the Beast. (Woman moaning) RAY: Oh, yes. (Moaning passionately) (Panting) Oh, God. (Laughter) Jesus, baby. You're gonna kill me. It ain't ten years ago. CHARLOTTE: (Giggles) You could've fooled me. I've been married to an older man, remember? RAY: (Chuckles) What was that like?

 CHARLOTTE: You want to know how you stack up? RAY: (Laughs) No. (Sighs) CHARLOTTE: Let's just say Karl had other talents. RAY: Yeah, serious coin to own a spread like this. CHARLOTTE: That's not it. RAY: Was it worth it? CHARLOTTE: Put your pants on. RAY: Oh, Char, I didn't mean anything. CHARLOTTE: No, I want to show you something. RAY: Okay. The basement. What's in there, a sex dungeon? CHARLOTTE: Mexico. RAY: Shit. I'm guessing this was Karl's idea? Drugs? CHARLOTTE: Immigrants. We were broke. I didn't know. RAY: What's on the other end? CHARLOTTE: A crazy, psychotic bitch. RAY: And you want me to deal with her? (Footsteps approaching) What the hell?

(Indistinct radio communication) WADE: That's a big bead. MARCO: And a Colombian necktie. Narcos do this to each other. WADE: Yeah, but our victim's a shrink. He's not a narco. - What story is he telling? - MARCO: (Speaking Spanish) COOPER: I put a patrol on every street within a three-mile radius, boss. He pulled a Houdini. We got nothing. WADE: (Sighs) How's that little girl holding up? COOPER: She's with Sonya. WADE: Any word on the mother? COOPER: MIA. Still working on it. MARCO: I'll let her know. - COOPER: He's pretty. - WADE: Pretty dead. SONYA: You saw everything. GINA: It was so fast. I... I don't know. SONYA: Do you remember what he looked like? GINA: Yes. No. SONYA: I need specifics. - Uh, hair color. - GINA: Stop. - SONYA: Eye color. - GINA: Stop. (Knocking on door) GINA: What's going to happen to me? MARCO: Uh, do you know where your mother is? GINA: No. SONYA: We're gonna take you to the station. MARCO: It's okay. You're gonna be safer there. You should pack your bag. (Phone ringing) MARCO: Made a mistake leaving that car at the scene. Is that a real police cruiser? COOPER: No, guy must have bought an '02 Crown Vic at auction, tricked it up to look like one. The lab's all over it. MARCO: Don't put that up. Not while she's here. COOPER: Copy that. SONYA: Hey. You have more photos of Meadows' patients? MARCO: Yeah, here. You're welcome. SONYA: I didn't say I thank you. MARCO: Exactamente. SONYA: Gina heard her father talking to someone before the murder. WADE: And you're thinking that the killer was a patient, right? SONYA: Maybe. MARCO: Well, Dr. Meadows saw a lot of cops. WADE: Makes sense. He was a network provider for the health plan. He saw a lot of El Paso PD, DEA, FBI patients. SONYA: Cop car, cop psychiatrist. WADE: Okay, look, what do you say we all keep this law enforcement angle between us, all right? - COOPER: Yes, sir. - MARCO: Sure. WADE: How's she holding up? SONYA: She's a bad eyewitness. I'm not getting anything from her. WADE: Well, Sonya, she's 15 years old and she just lost her father. Go gentle. - Okay? - SONYA: I got her breakfast. WADE: Good thinking. SONYA: Here you go. GINA: I don't think I can eat. SONYA: Would you like a glass of water? GINA: That's okay. SONYA: Okay. Take a look at these. Tell me if he's one of them. GINA: You're staring. SONYA: I'm sorry. GINA: No. SONYA: Try again. - Please. - GINA: He's not there. SONYA: Maybe if you ate something. GINA: Can I have a cigarette? - SONYA: Are you 18? - GINA: No. SONYA: Then you can't.

You can do this. (Door buzzer blaring) ADRIANA: These are classified FBI files. Where did you get these? FRYE: I told you, I have a source. ADRIANA: So the agent who got his head cut off was screwing a hooker who got cut in half? FRYE: Exactamundo ADRIANA: But the killer's not random. He hasn't called. FRYE: Not since Marco Ruiz jacked my phone. ADRIANA: You don't know it was Marco. FRYE: Yeah, it was him. My phone just randomly disappears, then shows up in lost and found two days later. It was him. Same move I would've done. ADRIANA: The killer's making a connection. FRYE: Yes. ADRIANA: So what other connections are we missing? FRYE: I don't know. ADRIANA: We should start with Cristina Fuentes. FRYE: Yes. Wait, back to Juarez? ADRIANA: Yeah. (Sighs) FRYE: Okay. Bring it. MARCO: Hey, mijo. MARCO: Shouldn't you be in school? GUS: No, I... I only have one class today, so I though I could ride home with you. MARCO: Well, uh, I've got to work and... GUS: When are you coming home? MARCO: (Wry laugh) GUS: Are you coming home? MARCO: I don't know. It's up to Alma. GUS: But this is the second time you've done this. MARCO: No, no, no... That-that was different. GUS: Different? Okay. Fix it. MARCO: No, no, no. Wait, wait wait, wait! Gus, wait! GUS: Alma doesn't deserve this. Okay? Okay? Why would you do this? MARCO: You know what? Just go home. GUS: No. No, I don't want to go. MARCO: Just be there with your sisters, please. Be there for me. Help Alma... please? Okay, it's not gonna be like the other time, I swear. I promise. SONYA: She can't I.D. the killer. I need more photos. MARCO: Um, Gus, Sonya. Remember each other? - SONYA: Yeah. Hi - GUS: Hi. - How is the case going? - SONYA: Good. We have a witness. - I need your dad. - MARCO: Yeah. GUS: Okay. Take him. SONYA: Anything wrong? MARCO: Mm... nope. SONYA: Okay. ADRIANA: Fuentes... FRYE: Oh, my God, can we please get out of here. Nocomprende, but that dude looks tense. ADRIANA: Yeah, it's more than that. SONYA: Find something? MARCO: No. How's it going with Gina? SONYA: She can't remember anything. MARCO: She's been through hell. SONYA: The cut... The Colombian necktie... Maybe her father was into drugs? MARCO: I already checked. He's clean. Have you tried talking about something else with Gina? - SONYA: Why would I do that? - MARCO: To get her to trust you. SONYA: She trusts me. I'm a cop. (Marco chuckles) MARCO: Got a moment? WADE: Yeah, come on. MARCO: I was going through Meadows' patient files - and, uh... - WADE: And, uh, you found me... - didn't you? - MARCO: Yeah. (Wade sighs) - WADE: Does Sonya know? - MARCO: No. WADE: Good. (Wade sighs) - You want to know why? - MARCO: If you want to tell me. WADE: Everybody has their own case that costs. MARCO: Yeah... I have many. WADE: This one was a girl. 18 years old. Found her in a ditch. She'd been raped and beated and... What this guy did to her was... Anyway, I caught the case, and the mother was out the picture, her father was missing in action. So... the girl's little sister came to I.D. the body. She was 15 years old having to do that. MARCO: You get the guy? WADE: Yeah, it was a truck driver. His name was Jim Dobbs. He looked really good for it. I chased him to a motel half a mile from the border. And if you read the report, it'll tell you that he reached for a gun on the night stand. Reports are funny things. MARCO: You took him down? WADE: Yes, well... I put a bullet right in his brain pan, but it didn't kill him. No, it went "pshoo"! So now he's got three hots and a cot, courtesy of the state. Course he doesn't know what day it is. MARCO: So they sent you to the shrink. WADE: No, I sent me to the shrink. I was having a hard time with what I done. MARCO: He deserved it. WADE: No, not Dobbs. I could give a rat's ass what I did to that asshole. I was troubled with what... what I did to the little sister. See, I took away any hope she had of getting answers. - MARCO: Her. - WADE: Sonya. Yep. And I'd appreciate you keeping this between us. Yeah. Thank you. MARCO: (Sniffs) Yeah. GRACIELA: You're too skinny. Men don't like them too skinny. - RAY: I like her just fine. - GRACIELA: Monte. MONTE: I like women in all of their forms. GRACIELA: What's the point of this meeting? CHARLOTTE: My partner and I would like to make some changes in the arrangements. - GRACIELA: Your "partner"? - RAY: Ray. CHARLOTTE: From now on... I don't know anything about the tunnel. For everything... and I mean everything... - you deal with Ray. - GRACIELA: And who is Ray? RAY: I'm the guy you're dealing with. Seriously, I'm reliable. Truth be told, it's not my first dope rodeo. MONTE: Miss Rivera has no involvement in narcotics of any kind. RAY: Ea-Ea-Easy there, Tex. I'm really good at moving things from here to there. You know what I mean? MONTE: Name, date of birth, Social Security number. If everything checks out it will be just like it was with Karl... but with Ray. RAY: Nice doing business with you. GRACIELA: We'll see. RAY: Adiós, muchachos. MONTE: He kept my pen. SONYA: A sketch artist is coming. GINA: Great. SONYA: Gina, it's important that you try. (Marco taps on glass door) MARCO: They want you in the the garage. Trujillo's having trouble getting the VIN number off the car. SONYA: The killer's way too careful. He's not gonna find anything. MARCO: He still wants to talk to you. MARCO: How are you holding up? GINA: (Voice breaks) I don't know. I can't remember. It's... It's like it was a really messed-up dream or something. MARCO: Yeah. I believe you. GINA: You smoke? MARCO: Yep, sometimes. GINA: Can I have one? MARCO: It's bad for you. GINA: I know. Please. MARCO: One. But you can't tell my partner where you got it, all right? (Gina chuckles) GINA: Yeah, she's, uh... (Chuckles) She's pretty intense. MARCO: Yeah, she is. Deal? GINA: Yes. FRYE: What's up with all this spy-versus-spy bullshit? ADRIANA: Look, if we keep asking questions about the Death House, we're gonna end up in a scary place. FRYE: That's what we do. We ask questions. - ADRIANA: It's different down here. - FRYE: No shit, Sherlock. Ow! - ADRIANA: The Calle Parsonieros house? - FRYE: Uh-huh? ADRIANA: Cristina was throw in there with 22 other bodies. FRYE: Yeah. ADRIANA: There was another body in the house... Rafa Galvan. FRYE: Fausto's brother? ADRIANA: Yeah. There is no way he could admit his brother had been killed, so he made it all disappear. FRYE: How'd he do that? ADRIANA: With the help of the police. Specifically, one Chihuahua State Police detective. (Frye snorts) - FRYE: Marco Ruiz? - ADRIANA: You tell me. He was assigned the case and the case disappeared. FRYE: And that, that brings us back to Fausto. ADRIANA: Which is what I wanted to show you. FRYE: Oh... my God. ADRIANA: This is what Fausto does to a sicario that pisses him off. What do you think he'll do to you if he finds out you're asking questions? FRYE: Why don't they cut him down? ADRIANA: They're afraid of Fausto. FRYE: I'm not afraid. Are you? ADRIANA: Yeah, I am. FRYE: You still want to work the story? ADRIANA: Hell, yeah. FRYE: Good. Give me your phone. SONYA: What about his cheeks? Full? Hollow? GINA: I don't know. It was dark. I was hiding. I only saw him for a second. SONYA: How about his hair? Long? Short? GINA: Look, I don't know! All right? I don't know. I don't. It was so fast and I was so scared, I can't remember. MARCO: I think we should take a break. SONYA: Okay. MARCO: Go on. MARCO: You can't push her like that. She saw something terrible. Something she'll never forget. SONYA: I know, but she has to remember his face. COOPER: Sorry, Gina's mother is here. - SONYA: Oh, good. - COOPER: Not necessarily. She's with Hank. WADE: Mrs. Meadows, this is Detective Cross and Detective Ruiz. They've been talking to Gina. - MRS. MEADOWS: How is she? - MARCO: Oh, she's fine. She's helping us identify your husband's killer. MRS. MEADOWS: Ex-husband. I'm-I'm gonna take Gina home. WADE: Well, I don't think that's a good idea. MRS. MEADOWS: What are you talking about? - SONYA: You're on drugs. - (Marco scoffs) MARCO: What she means is that Gina's safer here with us. SONYA: You're supposed to take care of your daughter. WADE: (Firmly) Sonya... SONYA: Oxycontin? WADE: Are you using, ma'am? SONYA: Your husband couldn't get you help? MRS. MEADOWS: Help? Peter gave me my first prescription for oxy. MARCO: Did he write prescriptions for other people? MRS. MEADOWS: Isn't that what this is all about? That house didn't get paid for by doing contract work for the county health plan. SONYA: Okay, Meadows sells drugs, so he's killed like a narco. Gedman uses prostitutes, so he's beheaded. Illegals poisoned. A judge and a prostitute bisected. WADE: It's all over the place. It's personal, it's political. It doesn't make any sense. SONYA: It does. It does to him. Maybe Gina knew what her father was into.. - MARCO: Not now, Sonya. - WADE: Marco's right. If you press her now, you're not gonna get anything. Burgers, chili, onions... heartburn... Come on, my treat. SONYA: We don't have time to eat, Hank. WADE: Yes, we do, Sonya. Yes, we do. Marco, you coming? MARCO: I got to take care of something at home. (Phone ringing) KENNETH: Sooner or later, you're gonna have to answer that. ALMA: For now, I'll talk later. KENNETH: Cheers to that. (Phone ringing) It gets better... I mean, the end is always tough, but then... you move on. Time passes. And you just end up... different. ALMA: But I don't know if different's what I want. KENNETH: Well, you'll figure it out. And just give yourself time. ALMA: Yeah. Thank you. (Alma sighs) This feels so nice. KENNETH: I'm... I'm sorry. ALMA: No, it's-it's okay. (They clear their throats) It-it really helps me to talk to somebody. WADE: Pretty damn good, isn't it? GINA: Really. SONYA: I don't like burgers. WADE: Well, that's Un-American. Eat your freedom fries. GINA: Did you get a hold of my mom? WADE: We did. GINA: So, she's picking me up? WADE: Honey, I don't think going home with your mom is the best thing for you right now. GINA: Yeah. She's got her problems. SONYA: My mom was like that. GINA: Really? SONYA: Yup. Her thing was cocaine. And men. WADE: Your mom can get clean. GINA: She's tried. WADE: Well, we'll gonna help her try again. Hey, if you're not gonna eat that, I will. GINA: I need to go to the bathroom. WADE: Of course. SONYA: Her mom's not gonna get clean. She's going to Social Services till she's 18. WADE: Well, there are different ways to coat that pill, Sonya. SONYA: I hated Social Services. WADE: Well, you didn't turn out too bad, did you? Excuse me. Gina? Gina! Hank! WADE: Hey, Gina! Female, Caucasian, 15 years old, black and white sweater, blue jeans, brown shoes... in the vicinity of Missouri Avenue. (Panting) WADE: Hey, Sonya! Gina! (Woman screaming) SONYA: Gina. Gina. - Gina! No! - (Gina crying) Hank! Okay, just hold on. Hold on. GINA: It was him. (Gina struggling to speak) Am-am-am I gonna die? SONYA: You just hang on for me. Shh... - Shh... - (Gina gasping) GINA: I... I-I got the eyes right. SONYA: No, n-n-no, no! No, no! (Sonya groans) SONYA: Help. Help me. (Grunting, gasping loudly) WADE: Shh... Okay... Shh... SONYA: Don't touch me! (Marco sighs) (Sighs) MARCO: Okay. (Phone ringing) Hey. SONYA: Gina's dead. She ran from the restaurant, and he got her. MARCO: Who else knew she was with us? SONYA: Nobody. Her mother, the FBI, our people. MARCO: He's watching us. Are you all right? (Sonya panting) SONYA: Yes. I'm fine. ADRIANA: Figured I'd find you here. Are we following the story or drinking the day away? FRYE: I... am drinking club soda, because I am 48... oh! Excuse me, I am now 51 hours sober. (Frye clicks tongue) Here's to the next ten minutes. ADRIANA: Good for you. FRYE: Oh, yeah, I deserve a merit badge. Let's just work the story, huh. ADRIANA: Okay. So, the killer dumps half of Cristina Fuentes in a Death House. FRYE: And Marco Ruiz is the lead investigator, but the case gets buried. ADRIANA: It doesn't feel like a coincidence. FRYE: The killer, he wants us to know... that Marco's dirty, right? ADRIANA: Maybe. (Phone rings) RAY: Ah, Timbo. Right on time. TIM: You know me, Ray. Clockwork when it comes to business. How's Texas? RAY: Interesting. TIM: And Charlotte? RAY: Smoking hot, horny. (Chuckles) It's rough, dude. TIM: Oh, yeah, sounds it. So, what's up? RAY: I want to get something going down here. TIM: Yeah... RAY: You know what I mean? TIM: I do. RAY: Think you could set me up with 50 to start? TIM: Oh... Yeah, I don't... I don't know. RAY: I thought you said you were the man in Tampa. - TIM: I am. - RAY: So? TIM: It's gonna take me a couple of days. RAY: Sweet. TIM: All right, take it easy, Ray, or don't take it at all. - Later. - RAY: Later. ATF AGENT: Good job, Timmy. Snitching suits you. TIM: You got what you want. I'm good, right? ATF AGENT: Oh, no, bud. We are just getting started. (Lock buzzes) FAUSTO: Marco Ruiz. MARCO: Faustón... Sync and corrected by Elderfel Resync for WEB-DL by lost0ne www.addic7ed.com
