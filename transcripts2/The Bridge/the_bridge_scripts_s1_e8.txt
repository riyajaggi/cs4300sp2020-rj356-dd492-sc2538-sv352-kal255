But I have a partial match on a car that was sold at auction in Las Cruces five years ago. Get a name? Jack Childress. Lives out on McNutt Road. El Paso PD. Open the door! He's been to Mexico. Many times. He calls them his "missions." I will shoot you.

 I believe you will. Could've run. Why'd you stay to shoot? The job wasn't done. I meant to kill the Mexican. I know this is just desire So won'! you stay with me God, that feels so good. (YELLS) (LAUGHING) I can't... I can't... I can't feel my dick. Guess what? (SPEAKING SPANISH) It is a little... It's a little cold in the nether regions. Daddy! Hey. Give me your pants. Oh, shit! For real? I want those pants. Give me the pants! (LAUGHING) Yes! Yes! (ALL CHEERING) You're rich. Rich guys aren't supposed to run... Oh, shit...aren't supposed to run out of drugs ever. It's the great equalizer, dude. It's a buzzkill. Any case, we'll be across and back in 20 minutes. Oh, no. My passport It's in my other pantalones. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Go, go with Claudia hot tits. I'll be back with the blow. Oh, yes. Come here. Oh, my pants. Santi! I salute you. (BOTH GRUNT) Bye-bye! Yes! Go get 'em. Yes! Oh, yes! Ándale! (THEME SONG PLAYING) Until I'm one with you My heart shall no! pass through Our love will be mistaken Thirty-three illegal weapons found at your place, Jack. You prepping for the end times? Dialectics is my answer. Dialectics is your answer. We got a laundry list of charges against you, cop-killing among them, and that doesn't end well. In your system? No. We also have a lot of bodies to talk about. Lorraine Gates. Cristina Fuentes. Gina Meadows. I don't know them. We found a bone saw in your truck. We're testing it for DNA. Well, test away, 'cause... It's not my saw. Someone put them there? Well, yeah. You guys invaded my land. Strangers all over my property. Who knows what you left there or took? Yeah, I've been stolen from before. What about the car at Peter Meadows' house, where he was killed? Also stolen! But you didn't report it. Who would I report it to? You? Why did you want to shoot Marco Ruiz? The Mexican? Yes. Equilibrium. But you had your chance in the warehouse. Why just kick him? Yeah, my brain, it... It needs a rest. Why not shoot him then? (GROANS) Hi. Hey. Where are the little ones? (SPEAKING SPANISH) (SPEAKING SPANISH) It's Alma's. She's going to a party. So, I heard you catch the killer. Oh, yeah. Yes, yes, yes. (SPEAKING SPANISH) That is cool. I mean, your marriage is falling apart, but congrats. Everything's gonna be fine, Gus. This is how it started with my mom. You stopped coming home. And after the divorce, I barely saw you. I... Was working. I... Yeah. You remember the red bike you gave me? The one that got run over by a van? Yeah. For your tenth birthday. Yeah, I remember. I left it in the street on purpose. Do you have any idea how many kids would kill for a bike like that? But I didn't want a bike. Maybe... I wasn't there for you enough. Maybe. You will understand when you have kids. It's not easy. Yeah, you sound like my friend Zina. There you go. That's a smart kid. You should stick with her. No, calm down, no. (LAUGHS) She's just a friend. You know, you can talk to me about stuff, right? Anything. You know that I would like it if we talked more. Okay. Okay. Somethings off. He's a lunatic. A lot is off. It just doesn't make any sense to me that he didn't shoot Marco at the money drop. His brain is scrambled. You read the notebooks. Yes. And he quoted his writings to Daniel Frye. Dialectics and that nonsense. I know. Hey. We got him. It's a good thing. Enjoy. Hey, Miss Kitty. Yeah? May I please have a cigarette? I thought you quit. I did, but... We're gonna smoke a victory cigarette. Come on. Come on. You said people stole from you. That's right. Did they steal your notebooks? Hell, yeah. I used to get harassed by law enforcement all the time. They'd raid me and take my stuff. 'Cause you were hunting immigrants. Not hunting. Tracking. Escorting. So, who harassed you? Cops? And Feds. Feds, well, they... Stormed my place and hauled off my things. Did they give some of 'em back? Yeah. But some things... Including my... Key writings... They kept. That right? Power tripping. Human nature. Hmm. I don't think that's true. "Slaves dream not of freedom, but of becoming masters.“ (LAUGHING) Holy smokes, it's Vanilla Ice. Ray-Ray. How do you like my cover? Ice Ice Baby. Nice, I'm glad this all worked out. Brother, do I ever let you down'? Never. And don't you forget it. (SIGHS) Ooh! All right, what do you say we unload and grab a couple of beers before we hit the road to Mexico? Slow your roll there, pal. This is as far as I go. What do you mean? I thought we were in this together. That wasn't the deal, amigo. I deliver. You want to move it again, do it your own self, comprende? David Tate. David Tate. Hey! Where's Hank? My favorite blouse. Where's Hank? I stood in line for two hours. You know, two's a coincidence, three's not. Yeah, no argument there. Morning. Hey, hotshot. Listen, the bosses want you at the press conference. And your girl's on some new shit today. Hey. Somethings going on, Marco. What do you mean? We have a new person of interest. No, no, no, no, no. We have Childress. I'm not sure he's the one. Sonya, he shot you. I know, I know. But I think he's being pointed to. Set up. By who? There's this ex-FBI agent who confiscated Childress' notebooks during an investigation. Never gave them back. Which happens sometimes. Sure. Same guy back in 2006, partnered with Gedman. Okay. And he was a patient of Dr. Meadows. I mean, that's three direct links in an hour. All roads lead back to David Tate. David Tate? FBI? You know him? We worked together on a task force. Well, does he fit the profile? It doesn't matter. David Tate's dead. Hey, how you feeling? Like a guy who just had a big ass seizure. Why don't you stay home a while? 'Cause there are more distractions here. Oh, wait. Um... This is for you. What is it? Your Christmas bonus. (SPEAKS SPANISH) Write a puff piece. Drink some champagne. Get a glimpse of the good life in Juárez. Apparently, there is such a thing. You're passing up a party? Yeah. If I go, I will drink. A lot. So this is the new Daniel. I hate him. Have fun. Don't let Santi Jr. seduce you. You know him? That's my boy. I've seen him turn a lot of gay girls straight. Oh, you're such a dick. Wear a dress! You got a nice ass. A sober dick. But a dick. Oh, my God. Yes, I know. I know. Okay, thanks. Hank thinks this is a wild goose chase. Well, we do have a guy locked up. Just need to make sure that David Tate is actually dead. He is. I attended his funeral. You did? Yes. Was it open casket? No. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Hey. Buenos días. Remember Sonya Cross? Buenos días. Gracias. (SPEAKS SPANISH) Right? And now you're investigating ghosts? We're not sure about David Tate's death. She's not sure. He's American, but died in Juárez. He came here to blow his head off. He had a lot of problems. Like what? Depression? Drugs? A car accident killed his wife and son. After that, yes, drugs, drinking... The FBI had to let him go. It says he left a note. Yeah, but we don't have it. And he was cremated here? His sister-in-law okayed it. Remember I told you, "From the bowl to the mouth, soup falls"? Mm-hmm. Yeah, right. So he was unrecognizable. They I.D.'d him with a driver's license that was just on him. It's totally possible that this is not even David Tate. Sonya... It's possible. Yeah. We have so many murders here, we hardly investigate the suicides. Can I have this? Sure. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Tim? Hey, Char. Long time. Yeah, I'll say. You know, I heard you were doing well, but, damn girl, you're frickin' rich. Yeah. What are you doing here? Just getting up with my boy Ray. What's with the ice cream truck? Oh. Well... You know how I like the little kiddies. Joking. (swans) Yeah. Ray said I could stay in the pool house. He did? Where is he anyway? He's out running errands. You know Ray, always up to something. Yeah. I know. Tim sucks. Tim sucks Satan's cock. Tim swallows that suck sauce like warm beer. Okay. Oh! Mother of pearl! (GRUNTS) (SPEAKING SPANISH) (SPEAKING SPANISH) (MOANS) (GASPS) (LAUGHING) (BUZZING) WOMAN: I lost touch with David after the accident. Then he pulled a Kurt Cobain down in Juárez. Did you ever see his body? I just told them to go ahead and cremate him. The poor guy. You liked him? I felt sorry for him. He lost his shit after Jill. I heard he had drug problems. He had life problems. He couldn't get over it. Why was your sister going to Juárez at that hour? Cheating, per usual. She had a boyfriend across the bridge? I never met him, but she was crazy for him. But she had her 10-year-old in the car with her. She was gonna leave David. My guess is they got in a fight that night, she grabbed Caleb, headed to Juarez. Never made it. Now I feel bad. Why? You're not supposed to talk shit about the dead. It's okay to have bad memories. Well, thanks. I'm a man of my word. Do I... Am I required to seal the deal again? (SPEAKING SPANISH) Seal the deal. I don't know what you're talking about. The last time, you were begging me for it and shit. HANK: Why am I back at Childress' place? TIM: Well' we got him dead to rights, but now I got a bonus charge. Aren't you supposed to be taking some lost time? Whatever. I come out here, find a crack in the cement bigger than my great-aunt Betsy's forehead. Get construction out here. They're bitching, moaning, "Oh, Coop, it's nothing." And then bang, they hit something. Is it a rock? Hmm? Is it a pipe'? Hmm? Or... Who the heck is this? TIM: Body was I.D.'d as Kenneth Hasting, went missing in ought-six. What's his story? He had a minuteman chapter, bumped up against Jack's operation. Dueling racists. That's charming. Well, it all ended in tears, and with Kenneth underneath a concrete slab. It doesn't fit with the other murders. Come again? This is a petty kill, a rivalry. It's not our guy. Meaning Childress is innocent. Not innocent. TIM: Well, yeah. Because when Deputy Stokes' brain matter spattered all over Marco's face, I was pretty damn sure you were there. What I'm saying is maybe he was set up by David Tate. David... David Tate. Who's dead. Right. According to the Juárez report. But no one I.D.'d him. There's no prints, no suicide note. It's sloppy- That's Juárez. Sloppy. He could have faked his own death, so he could plan these killings without being detected. I know you're shutting this down, Hank. Sonya, it's far-fetched. Hank, he's connected to three victims. Horseshit, Hank. I mean, I'm sorry, but there's got to be a limit to how much we indulge our village idiot savant here. (SPEAKING SPANISH) (BOTH CHUCKLE) Dani. (SPEAKING SPANISH) We're just colleagues at a work event. No big deal. No, we're not. Well, that's the party line. Until you say otherwise. You're so easy to be with. I want you to be comfortable. I shouldn't be. But I am. The other night... Day, actually. Yeah. That wasn't just... No. For me, either. Oh! Thank goodness. I was leaving you a note. I need to talk to you, Darcy. Yeah, and I need to get to the CVS. I got to buy one of them there shower seats. Mom fell again, three times now, but will she use a walking stick like a sensible, normal human being? Well, let's see. Oh. No, she will not. Wow. You going to church? There's some weird stuffs been going on. Weird, Steven? I seem to have a monkey on my back. Well, hell's bells, we all do. I need a few days. Impossible. No, really. I have to take a trip. Is this about that girl? What girl? The one whose picture you carry around. I watch you, Steven. No. No. Well, what then? Just. Feelings and thoughts that I need to sort out. Well, sort 'em out while you're bleaching the floor. No. No! I'm sorry, Darcy. I can't be of service at this time. (SIGHS) Sonya. Hi. You looking for your dad'? No. You. Oh. Did you get the chocolates? That was you? Mm-hmm. I don't eat chocolate. My bad. You all right? Yeah. Just taking a break. Congratulations. On the arrest and all. Thanks. Umm. Gus, I don't think your dad would like you sending me things. Why not? Well, I've been getting to know him, and I just don't think he would like that. He doesn't have to know. I don't like secrets. I guess it was kind of crazy of me to think you might like me, too. I'm... I'm not good with... With what? People. Closeness. Why not? Um... I, I... It's just... It's hard for me. I just don't know what people want. You know, when to talk, when not to talk. Or when to walk away, I just don't know. Well, I think it's hard for everyone. I'm the dummy who gave you the candy you didn't want. (BOTH LAUGH) I better... See you around. (SPANISH MUSIC PLAYING) (SPEAKING SPANISH) (SPEAKING SPANISH) Gracias. Daniel Frye. No. No. Whoa! Your hair looks sexy, baby. What are you doing? Just taking care of business. What's in the gym bag? Laundry. You and Tim are running some stupid scheme, aren't you? Whoa, whoa. Stupid? Ray, I don't want this. You and your shady ideas. No, no, hey, hey, listen. It's not like that. I want to be legit. I want you to be legit. I hear you, darlin'. I do. Then whatever you're up to, stop it. Done. I mean it. Babe, come on. Has ol' Ray-Ray ever let you down? A million times. (LAUGHS) Come on. And get Tim out of my pool house. (SPEAKING SPANISH) (SPEAKING SPANISH) Sonya, let it rest. What? Forget about David Tate. I did. This is Kenneth Hasting, the body they found. No, that's David Tate. Marco... This is Kenneth Hasting. And he has a current driver's license. That's David Tate. I have to tell you something. Okay. Well, it's bad. It's gonna shock you. (LAUGHS) I've been warned. I'm pregnant. Now? And married and out with another man. And enjoying yourself? Yeah. Me, too. So messed up. Yes, it is. But... And you still like me. And I want to take you home with me right now. Meet me outside in five? Yeah. You don't recognize me, do you? Sorry. Yeah, maybe you didn't check the papers after what you did. Look, I meet a lot of people... What the hell? Look at me. What. There was a hit-and-run on the Bridge of the Americas, February 10, 2007. I don't know. You were driving like an asshole does, clipped a Honda from behind. Flipped it. My wife was driving that car. My son was in the backseat. They were both crushed. It wasn't... You took my whole life away. Then just drove on, like it didn't matter at all. (SIRENS BLARING) He's not hiding anymore. (SPEAKING SPANISH) (SPEAKING SPANISH) This is Captain Robles. Lieutenant Wade. It seems your serial killer crossed over into Mexico. Yeah. (SPEAKING SPANISH) ...would like very much to see that bead. You have someone in custody, no? We do. I guess everyone makes mistakes. I would like for my detectives to collect it, please. You can trust my people. Señor. MARCO: Oh, Jill. I love you. (RETCHING) Hey! You're contaminating the crime scene! (SIGHS) I knew Jill Tate. Friend? More than that. Sex. We had an affair while I was friends with David. Marco, you should've told me that. I didn't think it mattered. We need to tell the others. No, please. It's important Sonya... I know I was wrong not to tell you. (SIGHS) Were you still seeing her when she died in the hit-and-run? Yes. You're the man across the bridge. Tired? Not really. Me neither. Ripped By mstoll
