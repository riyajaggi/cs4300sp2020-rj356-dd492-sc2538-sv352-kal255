 David Tate's family. He told me. That's why he's been targeted all this time. MARCO: Leave him alone. Take it out on me. KENNETH: Well, isn't that what I'm doing? Come alone. Entirely alone. Leave her. MARCO: Don't tell anyone where I went. WADE: Hey, where's Marco? SONYA: He got a call and left. WADE: Got a call from who? KENNETH: You have a gun? MARCO: Yes. KENNETH: Good. I'll drive.

 CHARLOTTE: Shoot him. RAY: Thought you said we were gonna scare him. CHARLOTTE: Well, I changed my mind. TIM: No, whoa, whoa... (Gunshot) RAY: You ain't smelling too good there, Timbo. (Grunts) (Panting) (Lively music playing) Hello. Hola. Anyone around? (Music continues) Oh. Man! Oh, shit. Holy shit! (Turns off music) What the hell? Stay cool, bro. Stay cool, bro, stay cool. I'm just gonna borrow this, Pedro. (Clicks) What the f...? (Grunting with effort) Take it easy, Tim. Or don't take it at all.

KENNETH: Here you go. For my wife, it was instant. I know what you're thinking. Don't. MARCO: I just want my son back. KENNETH: My son lived for ten minutes after the crash. His name was Caleb. Do you remember that? MARCO: I'm sorry, David. I'm sorry you lost your son. KENNETH: Thank you. I imagine him there. Under the car. Crushed. Unable to breathe. MARCO: (Sighs) Please, David. KENNETH: I always hoped he was already gone, you know. In his head. Daydreaming about something nice. Something warm and safe. But I have a feeling, down in the utter bottom of myself, that it wasn't like that for him. I think it was like dying in a cold, dark place. Alone. Waiting for me to save him. MARCO: It was an accident, David. KENNETH: But I never showed up. He died alone. Right about here, in fact. (Tires screech, horns blare) MARCO: What are you doing? KENNETH: Here we go. (Horns honking) (Motorist yelling) MARCO: What are you doing, David? (Horns honk, motorist yells) KENNETH: You ready, Marco? MARCO: Get back. Go back! Back. Everybody back. Tiene una bomba! He's got a bomb! Back! (Motorists clamoring) MARCO: Blowing up the bridge won't solve anything. (Distant sirens wailing) - KENNETH: Well, it depends. - MARCO: On what? KENNETH: You still want to see your son, right? (Marco exhales, gasps) KENNETH: I need to hear you say it, Marco. MARCO: Yes. I want to see my son! (Sirens approaching) KENNETH: Then let's get started. Open the trunk. MARCO: Frye. KENNETH: Get him out. (Sirens getting closer) MARCO: Come here. (Grunting, panting) FRYE: Ah! (Panting) (Water running) WADE: You shouldn't be here. You should be at the hospital. SONYA: I need to find Gus. WADE: So, Marco's with Tate, isn't he? Answer me, Sonya. SONYA: Yes. He went to meet him. WADE: So you decided not to tell me. In fact, you lied to me. SONYA: I'm sorry. WADE: Sonya, what is it? SONYA: I think I know where he is. I have to go back to Walter Chambers' house. WADE: Sonya, we've been all over that. There ain't nothin' there. SONYA: I know, but we're missing something. WADE: Well, what'd we miss? COOPER: That son of a bitch has Marco on the Bridge of the Americas. And he's got a bomb. - SONYA: Is Gus with them? - COOPER: No, but Daniel Frye is. - ADRIANA: He's gonna kill them both. - SONYA: No, it doesn't fit. Gus is part of this, too. I'm going to Chambers' house. WADE: Cooper, go with her I'll be at the bridge. Call me if you find anything. COOPER: Yes, sir. - SONYA: I need a gun. - COOPER: I have several. ADRIANA: Frye's always been a part of Tate's game. The bomb, the phone calls. I'm guessing Marco is, too. WADE: Ooh, I'm not gonna comment on that. Hey, we found Frye. We're done here. ADRIANA: Lieutenant, can I come with you? WADE: What, for Fry or the story? ADRIANA: For both. WADE: No. You'll be in the way. ADRIANA: Please. (Wade sighs) WADE: Aw, hell. (Muffled panting, gasping) (Tapping) (Muffled yelling) FRYE: What the hell's going... What the hell's going on? KENNETH: You know, Daniel. This is the end of your life. MARCO: Let him go. This is between you and I! KENNETH: Oh, Daniel is a part of it. A big part... aren't you, Daniel? - FRYE: You're crazy, Tate. - KENNETH: Maybe. But all you had to do was tell the truth. That's what a journalist does. But you didn't do that. Over there, both of you. MARCO: Come on. Come on. WADE: This is all about getting those two men off the bridge alive. - Do you understand that? - ADRIANA: Yes. WADE: Good. Then keep your mouth shut and stay out of my way. I got a job to do. - He made any demands yet? - LOPEZ: Not yet. - WADE: Got snipers in position? - LOPEZ: Yes. - WADE: Good. You got a shot? - LOPEZ: Yes, sir. KENNETH: If this vest I'm wearing detonates, it'll tear apart me, you, Frye and most of the center of the bridge. MARCO: Okay. You're in control, David. SNIPER: (Over radio) I've got a shot. On your call. WADE: No, hang-hang on. Bomb's live. Have your sniper stand down. He's activated the dead man's switch. LOPEZ: Hold your fire. (Over radio): Hold your fire. WADE: He's engaged the vest. He is in control now. ADRIANA: What's happening? WADE: There is no good outcome here. None. KENNETH: My thumb comes off this trigger, we all die... and so does any hope of saving Gus. MARCO: Just-just do whatever you have to do and tell me where my son is! And-and stop with all these bullshit games! (Sirens wailing) (Sirens stop) KENNETH: Take out your gun. Good. Now point it at him. WADE: What the hell's he doing? - Mar... - ADRIANA: Daniel. KENNETH: Your son is dying, Marco, right now. You have a choice to make. MARCO: Where is my son? KENNETH: Consequences, Marco. (Sobs echoing) (Sobs echoing) (Low grunt) KENNETH: Daniel Frye, a waste of a human being, dies... your son lives. I think most fathers would take that bet. Then maybe you'd go to jail. Maybe it's Juarez, and they look the other way. But you have your son, and life goes on for him. Now, kill him. (Marco panting) MARCO: I'm not gonna do that! KENNETH: Kill him, save Gus. (Marco panting, grunting) FRYE: No. KENNETH: Gus is dying, Marco. MARCO: I'm... (Panting) I'm sorry. KENNETH: Daniel, tell him what you did. FRYE: I didn't mean to. It was... it was a mistake. KENNETH: You failed to act, Daniel. You did nothing. Let's hope Detective Ruiz is made of better stuff. MARCO: Wha... (Marco grunts, pants) I'm not gonna do this! KENNETH: Isn't he everything you hate, anyway? The reason your real Juarez is overrun with violence? This... this is the man who buys those drugs and then sneers at the place he got them from and the people who died so he can pack his nose! MARCO: You're stalling right now. (Kenneth chuckles) How do I know my son is still alive? KENNETH: You're just gonna have to trust me. (Sobbing) (Sniffling) (Yelling) (Coughs) (Rapid panting, coughing) KENNETH: Now, shoot this lying piece of shit, and we'll be done. (Marco pants) (Marco panting) (Marco grunts) (Marco panting) MARCO: I'm not like you! KENNETH: You're not saving anyone. (Frye grunts) MARCO: Daniel! (Adriana gasps) ADRIANA: Daniel! (Water splashes) (Water running through pipes) COOPER: We've searched this already. There's nothing here, Sonya. SONYA: Shh. Help me. COOPER: Stop it, stop it. I got it. What? There's nothing. SONYA: Plaster. COOPER: Jesus. Pull it out. All the way out. Come on. All right, watch out. Step back. KENNETH: Was that supposed to be the honorable move? 'Cause it was the cowardly one. It doesn't mean anything. MARCO: Just tell me where he is. KENNETH: You will be like me before this ends. That I can promise you. In seconds, the snipers that I know are posted everywhere will take my head right off. And you'll never know where Gus is. MARCO: No, no, no. Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! WADE: Nobody shoot. Have your men hold their fire. LOPEZ: Hold your fire. Hold your fire. (Sonya grunts) SONYA: (Muffled) Gus! (Sonya panting) KENNETH: Pick up the gun, Marco. No? You're no hero. Alma told me what you did with that woman. MARCO: Oh, shut up! KENNETH: You haven't changed a bit. Your appetites ruin everything. Destroy families, ruin lives. All so you can get your rocks off? MARCO: Just, please, tell me where he is. KENNETH: He's in a dark place, Marco. (Marco groans) A cold, dark place. Good, Marco. Good. Do you know how Caleb died? Technically? He drowned in his own blood. MARCO: End this, David! Or I will! KENNETH: Caleb's lungs were crushed, right over there. Ambulance came in five minutes. It didn't even matter for Jill. Do you have any idea what that's like, Marco? To lose everything? Your wife, your son? No, you don't know. You can't know, Marco, what it's like to get that call. And to go see them. MARCO: I said I was sorry. Please... Tell me where he is. KENNETH: Okay. SONYA: Hank! I need to talk to Marco. - WADE: Sonya. - SONYA: I got to... I gotta stop him. - LOPEZ: Whoa, whoa, whoa. - WADE: It's okay. Leave it. Sonya, be careful! MARCO: Where is my son? KENNETH: Gus is dead, Marco. SONYA: Marco! Don't shoot! MARCO: Sonya? So... Sonya, did you find him? KENNETH: He's dead, Marco. MARCO: Shut up. KENNETH: You had your chance to save him, but it's too late. - MARCO: Sonya! - KENNETH: Marco, look at me. Gus is dead. MARCO: Sonya! KENNETH: He died in a cold, dark place, waiting for you to rescue him. And now there's only one thing left for you to do. SONYA: I found him! I found Gus! KENNETH: She's lying. SONYA: He was in the house. MARCO: What house, Sonya? SONYA: Chambers' house. He was behind the wall. MARCO: Did you find him alive? SONYA: Put the gun down Marco. MARCO: Answer me. Is my son alive? SONYA: Yes! KENNETH: She's not a very good liar, is she? MARCO: Sonya? SONYA: Don't kill him, Marco. That's what he wants you to do. MARCO: Sonya? Please. Just tell me if my son is alive. SONYA: (Panting) Yes! KENNETH: You found him... but is he alive? SONYA: Yes. Yes! MARCO: Sonya... Please tell me... Tell me the truth. (Marco sighs) (Marco cries, shouts) (Marco shouts) (Marco cries) (Marco wails) (Kenneth grunting) (Marco sobbing) (Handcuffs clanking) WADE: What do you say we go to that hospital and get the wrist set? SONYA: Okay. WADE: You went out on the bridge. You could've got yourself killed. SONYA: I did what I thought was best. What... what would you have done, Hank? WADE: I can't honestly say what I would have done. SONYA: Marco would have killed Tate. WADE: Yes, he would. And you prevented that. SONYA: I don't know what to say to him. WADE: Just go see him. He could use a friend right now. SONYA: A friend? WADE: Go on. (Sonya grunts quietly) SONYA: Hey. I brought you some clothes. MARCO: What for? SONYA: When you get out. MARCO: I don't want you here, Sonya. SONYA: I need you to listen to me, Marco. SONYA: I'm not leaving until you listen to me. I tried my best to save Gus, but he was already dead. And I told you... what you wanted to hear. What was I supposed to do? MARCO: Just... (Sighs) Leave me alone, please. SONYA: I'm not leaving. We're friends, Marco. And I only did what you taught me friends would do for each other. - MARCO: Friends? - SONYA: Yes. MARCO: You stopped me from shooting him. Why? SONYA: Because that's what he wanted. And you're not that person. MARCO: Oh, no. Yeah, I am that person. (Sonya sighs) MARCO: We're not friends, Sonya. We were partners. That's over. - SONYA: Okay. - MARCO: Okay. Now I don't want to talk about this anymore. I just... want to be alone. - SONYA: Okay. - MARCO: Okay. Go! Just go! (Sighs) (Crying) ADRIANA: Frye. Daniel Frye. - DOCTOR: Are you family? - ADRIANA: No. DOCTOR: I'm sorry. You can't see him. ADRIANA: Please. He doesn't have a lot of friends. DOCTOR: All right. ADRIANA: It's bad, isn't it? DOCTOR: We won't know for a while. It was quite a fall. ADRIANA: Is he gonna be all right? DOCTOR: He suffered massive internal injury, brain and spine trauma. ADRIANA: When will we know? DOCTOR: We'll have to see how he does over the next 48 hours. - ADRIANA: So we just wait? - DOCTOR: For now, yes. (Monitor beeping quietly) (Quiet whooshing) (Man sighs) MAN: Can I help you? MARCO: I'd like to see my son. Gustavo Ruiz.
