 (THEME SONG PLAYING) Until I'm one with you My heart shall no! pass through Our love will be mistaken (SPEAKING SPANISH) (DOORBELL RINGS) (KISSING) (LAUGHING) Hi. Sonya Cross, El Peso PD. I know. Hey. You don't answer your phone. Sunday night? Gus... (SPEAKS SPANISH) What are you doing here? I went to the Palm Motel. By yourself? Yes. They ID'd Ralph Gedman. He visited Cristina Fuentes every week. Okay, okay. Have dinner with us. Gedman was a personal kill. Why else cut his head off? And who's gonna be next? Twenty minutes. And then we talk about beheadings. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Oh! (SPEAKING SPANISH) Why do you keep looking at me? I don't. I'm not. Gus has been following the case on the Internet. How is the girl from the desert? Still unconscious. We're not supposed to talk about that. Right. Mmm. You left your wallet at Charlotte Millwright's. Thank you. Who's Charlotte Millwright? The woman on the bridge. Part of the case. Not very hungry? Doesn't taste good. Well, you don't have to finish it. (SPEAKING SPANISH) (CRYING) Who's that girl? Came in last night. Shoplifting. No one came to pick her up? I don't know. Hey. Fed nut huggers are hogging all the info on Gedman. Find a bead? Bigger than the last one, in with the money. Have you seen his FBI file? No, ma'am, but they have. Give us a little time. We need to see Ralph Gedman's file. Look, he was one of ours. He took that video of Cristina Fuentes, and that is the first link between two victims, and that's our only lead. You'll get your chance. There he goes. Like I said, nut huggers. Where have you been? In the back. Sleeping? Yeah, Sonya, sleeping. Damn. Sorry, buddy. The killer knew Gedman well enough to know about the video. We dropped the tail on Steven Linder? Yes, he's no longer our person of interest. He's of interest to me. Can we focus on the killer? You can. I'm gonna find this pendejo. Hey. He got the toss last night. He needs to go get mad at somebody. Oh. Okay.'! - Where's your mother? She hasn't been home. How long? Two days. Jesus. That woman. I didn't steal the earrings. They let you try them on, and I just... I forgot. Okay. I buy that. How much was the bail? More than your mother can afford, and I'm gonna charge her, believe me. Can I stay with you? No, honey. Heather's not used to kids. Okay. I can walk. I'll drive you. No, it's fine. I do have an appointment in 20. Bye. Hey. We're good, right? Yeah. Right. All right. DOCTOR: She'll be unconscious for a while. She still hasn't spoken. Just a few words. Like what? (SPEAKING SPANISH) Like that. No, I agree. Okay, bye. Who were you talking to? It's none of your business. Was that him? If it was, I would have to tell you, wouldn't I? Doesn't mean that you would. Mmm. Two full days, and he still hasn't called. That's my math, too. (SIGHS) I don't understand why. Maybe he's resting on his laurels, after he made you and the Feds look like a bunch of chumps. You do a lot of drugs, don't you? (LAUGHS) What? Why? (STAMMERING) I'm not telling you that 'Cause they're there and they're fun. They make you hate yourself just a little bit less. (LAUGHS) (DOOR CREAKS) Where's Eva? Who? You stole her. No. I need her back. (BREATHING HEAVILY) (GROANING) (GROANING) (onerous) (GROANS) (YELLS) (SCREAMS) (GROANING) (GRUNTING) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (KNOCKING AT DOOR) Steven Linder, I know you're in there. Steven. Yeah? Detective Marco Ruiz. Remember me? Yeah. Can I come in? I prefer that you didn't. It's kind of a mess. I was thinking what you said the other day... That you help people. Are you helping anyone now? I work at the shelter. You go over the bridge a lot? Some. Twelve times last month. I like Mexican food. No white person goes to Juárez that often, unless they're up to something. Like what? That's what I'm going to find out. Okay. Okay. You have a good day. (WATER RUNNING) I wish we could tap Frye's phone. Would be nice. He's not going to tell us if the killer calls again. He wants the story for himself. Selfish. How long can they stonewall? Their property- Could be a spell. (MARCO swans) I thought we were one big, happy team. HANK: Hey, you know, I need a root canal. That's why I'm in a mood. What's your excuse? He slept on a bench. He did what? In the back room. I can speak for myself, thank you. Slept on a bench in the back room. Well, you got me beat. What was the fight about? What do you think? How would I know? Sonya, you gave me back my wallet rig ht in front of my wife. Son. I dropped it in another woman's house. You had sex with Charlotte Millwright? Yes. You're married. Yes, I know. Look, we're partners. Partners look out for each other. That's an unwritten rule. Just forget it. Oh, man. Where are you sleeping tonight? I don't know. I have a couch. You can sleep on the couch if you like. (GRUNTING) (REPORTERS SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) Whoa, whoa. What are you writing? Ask me no questions, and I'll tell you no lies. I don't like to drink alone. Well, I don't like weird unannounced visits. We have things in common. Yeah? Such as? Well, Gedman... The killer left me his head. Left you his body. Very, very special. Did you see him? No. I did. Sort of. I feel like I can almost describe him, but then nothings there. I can hear his voice. What's it sound like? Hollow. Huh. Shit. Ay yi yi. Sorry. So sorry. This is where I work! It was an accident. She's talking. What's this? Daniel Frye's phone. How did you get it? (SPEAKING SPANISH) She says she saw a car. What did it look like? (SPEAKING SPANISH) What is she saying? Hold on. She wants asylum. KENNETH: You going to the library opening? ALMA: I should. I have to. Want to. But... But I just haven't gotten tickets. You seem distracted. Am I? Yeah, what's going on? (SIGHS) My husband. He's... Is he all right? Yeah. We're just not doing well. Oh. I'm sorry. Hey. Hey. Kenny, this is Gus, my stepson. Oh. I've heard about you. You have? She brags about you all the time. She does? I'll... I'll see you back there. Okay. How are you? Okay. I wondered about a ride over the bridge. Sure. Around 6:00? I know you're mad at my dad. Yeah. He doesn't think about anybody but himself. You know, how it affects you. Or me. Gus, you know you can stay at the house no matter what, right? Loan? Of course. I'm not mad at you. Because I could stay with Tico. It's fine. No, no, no. You stay home. Okay? Okay- Okay. HANK; Yeah. There's a problem with Maria. Which is... SONYA: You tell him. She wants asylum before she talks. She has information, but he encouraged her to wait. Really? She has a baby in Houston. She's been through a lot. So she wants a visa. I'd like to help her. Well, I know somebody at Homeland Security. SONYA: It's gonna take forever. Look, she needs this. And there's a chance that we can help her. So I'll reach out. Excuse me. Detective Ruiz? Excuse me. Charlotte Millwright has called twice. What would you like me to say to her? Um, I'll call her back. Okay. What? Nothing. Just seen it too many times. (BRAKES SCREECH) Oh, dear. (CELL PHONE RINGS) (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING OVER PHONE) Hello? WOMAN: Danny? Danny... Danny Frye? Who's this? (CELL PHONE RINGING) MAN: Daniel? Sonya Cross, El Paso PD. (CALLER HANGS UP) (SIGHS) Call back. Call back. (TELEPHONE RINGING) Sonya Cross, El Paso PD. MAN: You're working late. Yes. How did you get that phone? You don't like surprises? You talk as if you know me. I understand you. Maybe. I've been studying you. And eventually, I will find you. We'll see. You knew Ralph Gedman. Better than others. You knew his secrets. 1 showed what he was. How about Cristina Fuentes? How's! you get the video? I'm not special. That wasn't the question. If I knew, others knew. What others? Institutions know, and they ignore, and they protect. Gedman's institution? The FBI? (CALLER HANGS UP) Hello? Hello? How's Will doing? He's still fighting the good fight. They got him stationed someplace north of Jalalabad. He can't tell us where. That's hard. Yep. Carmen's going more than a little crazy. That why you're here? No, I wouldn't presume. I'm here because of the woman in the desert. She's asked for asylum. Oh, I bet she did. And I could use her cooperation. We talking U visa? Yeah. She's the victim of a public crime. That's a tough one, Hank. She could help us catch this guy. We have no dog in that fight. Yes, you do. Homeland Security doesn't want him out there making political statements about the border, getting everybody all riled up. I'll try. Good. Clock's ticking. Can you try right now? Jeez, you're bossy. Not always. I'll make some calls. Thank you very much. Okay. Good to see you. Mmm-hmm. Hey. CHARLOTTE: Hello. Hi. How are you? I'm fine. Do you want anything? No, thanks. (LAUGHS) Actually, I'm not fine. No? Do you know Graciela Rivera? Yeah, everyone in Juárez knows her. 'Cause I'm mixed up with her. No, no, you don't want that. The night that you were over... She strung up one of my horses. Yep, that's Graciela. Is she crazy? She'll burn your life down. So what do I do? Wait. Just wait. Power like hers, it snuffs itself out. Wait for how long? A year, two. Until it's over. So I just let her move these people through my land. (GROANS) Don't tell me too much, please. Okay. So I take the long view. Just live your life. How's your life? A little rough. (SIGHS) Thank you for meeting me. I have to take the long view, too. (EXHALES) (SPEAKING SPANISH) Do you want to come up? I got beer. Where were you? Charlotte Millwright. More sex? No. Did you steal Daniel Frye's phone? Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies. That's against the law. Maybe I took it by mistake. Maybe he left it somewhere and I found it. He called. The killer. And... The FBI knew about Cristina and the video. That's what they've been hiding. That's why they won't share their files. Well, they will now. What am I gonna say to Frye about this phone'? Just drop it into the Lost and Found at El Paso Times. Any luck? As a matter of fact, yes. Got Maria into the system. U visa. Great. HAN K: Yeah. They're processing the papers. You'll have them to give to her in the morning. Thank you, Hank. Really. It means a lotto me. All right, I'm gonna go home. Yeah, all right. You coming? Oh. Yeah. Thank you. Good night. SONYA: Good night. Thanks. Gracias. Sit. What's your name? Manda. I'm Gina. Who else is here? (SPEAKING SPANISH) (EXHALES) (CLEARS THROAT) (SIGHS) Well, hello. (CHUCKLES) Guess. (LAUGHING) You dickhead. It's Charlotte. Uh... Just... Drinking wine... Thinking about that night on the skiff. You, me, Bartles & Jaymes. (LAUGHING) (MANDO SPEAKING SPANISH) Esme! Good night. Yeah, good night. Who did those drawings? Jim Dobbs. It looks like they were made by a child. He's not a child. He's brain-damaged. How do you know him? He killed my sister. When did she die? When I was 15. So young. She was 18. Waitress at a truck stop. Yeah? There's lots of violence off the highways and rest stops and such. Was it a violent death? I'm sure you miss her very much. Sometimes. But she's gone. GINA: What was he going to do? Kidnap you. What? Throw you in the trunk, drive you somewhere, call your parents for money. Are you kidding? No. They do that here. What's that? Eight girls were found. Dead? Yeah, dead. He got them. Who? (SPEAKS SPANISH) The Beast. That's what we call him. The one who's killing all the girls. Is it one person? One, two, 100... No one knows. So, he's just The Beast. (BREATHING HEAVILY) (SPEAKING SPANISH) Now tell us what you saw. (SPEAKS SPANISH) Excuse me. Please, tell us what you saw. (SPEAKING SPANISH) She couldn't see his face. Uh-huh. (SPEAKING SPANISH) She says it was like a police car. Maybe he's one of us. (PLAYING) Don't your parents wonder where you are? No. Why not? My dad's obsessed with his bitchy girlfriend and her fake tits. And your mom? Just.“ Messed up. Here, take these. Thanks. I guess I'm going. Don't come back, okay? You could turn into a pink cross. Yeah. Okay. My sister's one of 'em. She got killed? Disappeared. Took the bus to her factory job, never come back. Gosh. Yeah. Keep the change. You came. You call, I come. If you know what I mean. (LAUGHS) Pilates? Yes. Nice. Look at you. All hot widow. You're smokin'', baby. How's Tampa? Buggy. Moist. Is this your spread? The whole damn thing. (WHISTLES) You did good. (LAUGHS) Now, let's have a few drinks, and I'll show you my new tattoo. Hey, Cooper. This for us? Yes, ma'am. I'd keep that on. FBI sent Gedman to the headshrinker. Did they redact the doctor's name? No, ma'am. Peter Meadows. Let's go see him. (DOG BARKING) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (CAR APPROACHING) (BRAKES SCREECH) (SPEAKING SPANISH) Did you call in the unit? No. Show me your hands! Show me your hands. (FLOOR CREAKING) Ready? Police! Are you hurt? You're safe now. You. I saw him. I saw The Beast. Ripped By mstoll
