 Neverland (2011): Season 1, Episode 1 - Part 1 - full transcript 
 In Victorian London Peter is one of a gang of street urchins rescued from the workhouse by gentleman thief Jimmy. Defying Jimmy's orders Peter takes the boys to the burglary of a jeweller's shop where Jimmy specifically has gone to steal a dazzling orb. Surprised by Peter Jimmy taps the orb and he and the other boys disappear. When Peter does the same he finds himself transported to a mysterious island, where his friends have been captured by pirates. Befriended by American Indians Peter sets out to rescue them but Jimmy has fallen for pirate leader Elizabeth Bonny and refuses to leave with them, taking over the ship as Captain James Hook. Peter encounters Dr Fludd, a four hundred year old mystic and his pet fairy Tinker Bell. The doctor has created the island as a Utopia to where he hopes to bring the world's finest minds but the pirates pursue and kill Fludd and leave Peter wounded.

 What's he doing? No! Stop! No! Fire! Fire! She's a-sinking already! Board! Before she takes her booty with her! lt's an 'eavy one, Captain. Oddio. lt's a war chest, l imagine, filled with Spanish doubloons.

 Eh? What the hell is it? lt's the holy grail. Don't be ridiculous, Smee. ldiota. There's no such thing. All right, it's Aladdin's lamp, then. There's something inside it. Aaah! What's the matter? lt's possessed! The damn thing's got a ghost inside it! Or a genie! Maybe it'll grant us a wish or two. lt's not of this world. Help!

 Let me at him! - l'm gonna kill him! - Come on, you little runt! Aah! Help! Come on, you mutt! - Help! - Little runt! Let me at him! That's us. Get him! Get him! Grab him! Oi! He's got my watch! They're thieves! Thieves! A gold watch. Blimey, Tootles. - Ohh. - You're an artist. What now? What's up, Twins? Slightly's gone and got himself nicked. Any instructions from Peter? No, he's--he's gone quiet. That's Beer Barrel Bertie. We don't have no plans for Beer Barrel Bertie... do we? Wait. Look over there. Excuse me. Officer, you, er, dropped this. What? lmpossible. Must have a buckle loose. - And, er, you dropped this. - That's my whistle! Well, how did you-- lt was down there, with your keys. My keys! Go. Go! He's got the blighter loose! - You there! - Come here! Whoa! Yes! Don't watch his sword, Stevens, watch his eyes! Remember, a man's intent is in his eyes! Sometimes smaller is smarter. Jimmy's gonna love this. Well done, Peter. l've got a nice job for you boys. - How nice? - Harbottle's Antiques. - Are you mad? - You're ready. - That place is tighter than the tower. - We'll get nicked for sure. Sorry, Jimmy, too dangerous. l think it's a brilliant idea. Harbottle's has two doors, as l remember-- one at the front and one at the back leading to an alley. There is a night guard, of course, and the windows are sealed shut, but... there are other ways in if you're small and cunning. lf we get nicked, it won't be the orphanage they throw us in, it'll be the clink. We wouldn't last a week. Weren't you at the bottom of Hackney Canal when Jimmy found you? Tied in a sack, with stones around your wrist and ankles. Jimmy's rescued every one of you. He's pulled you from the workhouses and asylums. He's given you a home. Food in your belly and shoes on your feet. lsn't it time we paid him back? Harbottle's Antiques. All who's with me, raise your right hand. A word in your ear, Peter. Curly's right. This one's too dangerous. - But it's worth it. - How do you know? You wouldn't risk it otherwise. You're growing up quickly, Peter, but you still have a lot to learn. Do you want to do this job or not? Oh, l want to do it, all right-- it's what l've been waiting for. Might get me back where l belong. But l've changed my mind. l'm going it alone on this one. You don't trust me. l don't want you to get nicked. - l'll get us in and out safe. - No. This one's mine. Things will be different when you're older. Licorice? What do you think of accounting? What? Bookkeeping. l had an uncle in Pinner who made bucketloads from just adding things up. Sounds a bit dull, Fox. He had a good life. Married a draper's daughter from Bexleyheath. Cooh. Brenda Fitzwilliam. Nice smile. Fox, what are you talking about? The future. Something to look forward to. What about you, Peter? You ever think of the future? l'm stickin' with Jimmy. lf you're not careful, you'll grow up to be just like him. And what's wrong with that? - lt's a dangerous life. - Adventurous, you mean. You want to spend the rest of your days in a shoebox, fine. But l want more. Now, Jimmy's going places, and so am l. One day we'll be partners. Believe me, that day can't... ...can't come soon enough. - Come on, we got a job to do. - What? Job? Yeah, Harbottle's Antiques. You remember? Tonight? Whoa, Jimmy didn't say anything about doing it tonight. Jimmy doesn't have to know. We'll surprise him. Make it look like an ordinary break-in, take whatever else you want. Of course. And should you be lucky enough to find the artifact there, handle it with the utmost care. Have you considered my terms? Money's not a problem, but the other business is more difficult. l'm afraid it's not negotiable. My client is using what influence he has, but-- But what? Reestablishing your position in London society The Granville Club won't take you back, and most of the new businessmen he spoke to want concrete references-- introduction's no longer enough. Well, if anyone can do it, Fludd can. As l said, he's doing his best. lf there's a slip-up, l don't know you. Understand? Perfectly. Penny for the guy, mister? lt's September! Now get lost! Ruddy pests! Penny for the guy! Penny for the guy! Where did you spring from? Come here. Come on. Gotcha! See? Couldn't be easier. Not bad. Wow! Whoa! Oh... Oh! What the hell do you think you're doing? - lsn't this what you wanted? - You know it isn't. l changed my mind. l told you l was doing this one alone. Yeah, but look. We're in! Why didn't you tell us, Peter? - Because you wouldn't have done it. - So you lied to us. l wanted to show Jimmy what we were made of. - He thought we were too young. - l am too young. Fill your bags and wait by the door. Curly, keep an eye out the back. Nibs, watch the front. Sorry, Jimmy. l just wanted to show you that l could do it. lf you're going to be my partner one day, you must never go behind my back. One day? But l'm ready now. Believe me, you've got a lot of growing up to do first. Are you looking for something in particular, Jimmy? l'll go and find something to force it open. Whoa! Wha-What is it? - Wow! - Whoa! Not bad. Unh! lt's all your fault, Peter. lf you'd done as Jimmy said and just--just left it alone... ...then they'd still be here. You were looking for this, weren't you, Jimmy? Who were you working for? - Where's Jimmy? - He's out. When will he be back? What do you want him for? What do you want with Jimmy? Oi, come back! Why do you follow Jeffries, boy? - Jimmy didn't send you, did he? - What do you want with Jimmy? That's my business. Where is he? Just...gone. What do you mean, gone? A bomb in Harbottle's. - He found the orb, didn't he? - You know what that thing is? So it was in Harbottle's after all. - Jimmy was working for you? - Where is it now? Tell me! lt blew him up and all my crew. Let him go, Jeffries. They weren't blown up. Where are they, then? Another world, more beautiful than you can imagine. But l can get them back if you tell me where the orb is. - How? - lt's a portal. A kind of door. And the slightest knock will activate it. But we must hurry. Heavens, Jeffries, if l'd have known it was at Harbottle's for sure, l'd have engaged someone more diligent-- - Hey! - After him! Hurry, Jeffries! A door... to another world. The slightest knock, eh? Wha--What a weird-looking place. But you're in there somewhere. Ain't ya, Jimmy? Open up, Peter! We can help you! Help me? When has a toff ever helped the likes of me? l got him into this... l'm gonna get him out. Hello? Where am l? Come on, where are you? There you are. Lots of smoke... but no flames. - Give me that. - No! We've landed in hell, l tell you. Soon, Lucifer's demons will rise up to record our sins and throw us down there into the everlasting fire of damnation, where we will burn in agony for all eternity. Jimmy! Fox! Hear that? They're headed this way. Kill the smoke. Hide! Quickly! Buongiorno, amico. Got any goodies? Leave us alone! - Get off! - Let me go! - Go. - Just get off! Found another five little ones! Get off me! - Get off! - Let me go! Jimmy? Tootles. Pirates! We're coming aboard! Going aboard! - Aaah! - Aahh! Fox! Where did you spring from? You have no idea how glad l am to see you. - Where the hell have we landed? - l have no idea. All l know is... we're not in Shoreditch anymore. lt was that thing... in Harbottle's, wasn't it? l'm sorry, Fox. lt's all my fault. We should never have broken into Harbottle's in the first place. lf Curly was here, he'd string you up. l'll make good. l'll get them off that ship and home safe. Ship? A pirate ship. lt's a bloody nightmare. Weird crocs, spooky woods-- now pirates! What's next? Swarms of flying beasties? What's that? Ohh, what now? Run! Get 'em off! On your feet! We've gotta stay ahead of the swarm, otherwise we're dead! lnjuns! What year do ya come from? 1906. Ooh, that'll make me... 163 next October. 263, you mean. Ooh, maybe l can start thinking about settling down. Nice cottage on Venus. From the 1700s. How's that possible? Cod liver oil, stewed prunes, and regular trips up the rigging. Good for ya. And what are you good for, l wonder? lt still works. Tick-tock. Tick-tock, tick-tock. Tick-tock, tick-tock. Tick-tock, tick-tock! Did you bring anything else with you, did ya? Oh, sugared almonds, perhaps? - Just what you see. - Pity! How sweet. He carries a picture of his true love. What is this place? Can't you tell? lt's heaven. Or hell! Depending on your point of view. See? Lucifer's demons. What shall we do with them? Hmm? Well, l want the English lads. - What for? - They look so tender. l bet they'd taste good in a stew. My boys stay with me. He's a bold one, no? Well, he's not a bad-looking wag. - Eh? - Hmm. Maybe l could find a use for him in my cabin. Good idea! Maybe l need a rest. Just playing with you, Starkey. l'm just playing with ya. Throw him to the crocs! Smee, you can keep the boys. Oh, thank you, ma'am. You won't be sorry. l've got some coriander seeds and some ginger saved. Aaah! Right. Now, you'd better come with me. - You're not gonna like this next bit. - Jimmy! Come on. Aaaah! My boys... stay with me. Wait. l want to watch. You asked what l was good for. Well, as you can see, l'm handy with a blade. Who are ya? My friends call me Jimmy. "Jimmy." But the name's Hook. James Hook. l'm sorry for this, but... entrance to our village is secret. What are you gonna do with us? Dinner. You're gonna eat us?! Why? Do you taste good? Come. You must be hungry. What's this meat? Xaw. Are we in America? Not anymore. But you're lndians. We are the Kaw, people of the raven. We have become part of this world now. Do you know the way back to London? The chief. Chasing tree spirits is hungry work. He asks if you want to join our tribe. Thank you, but, um, once we've finished dinner we'll be on our way. We saved you before-- we may not be there to save you again. We're very grateful, but we have to rescue our friends from pirates. Where are we? We call this Geih Gwaay. Neverland. Why? Because we never age here. You might not believe this, but l am 130 years old. lnnu's son is 81 . The chief's daughter. She is called Aaya K'aang. "Tiger Lily" in your language. She is named this because she is as wild as she is beautiful. Don't get any ideas because she is almost 100 years old. You've left me with a bit of a problem. Three of my best men dead. One was my personal bodyguard. - lt was self-defense. - That's not the point. l can't get replacements here. No? You're not in London now, Hook. Do you notice anything unusual out there? l don't follow. Orion. Polaris. - Maybe you can point to the pole star. - Astronomy's not my best suit. Well, if it was, you'd notice that there isn't a pole star. And Orion is over there-- in the wrong place. How's that possible? Planet earth is in a different galaxy... far, far away. There's no way back. Are you sure? l've had almost 200 years to work it out. We've gotta fatten you up, and no mistake. Any bread and jam? Hmm. l've got cream cakes, sweetmeats, pickled herring, and crystallized dates. But sadly, no bread and jam, your highness. We're stuck here, but it needn't be all bad. This planet has something... special to offer. lt's mined by creatures of this world. The lndians call them tree spirits. This...is the stuff that makes them fly. lndians? We're not the only ones from our world, Hook. A year ago l captured one of them. He was carrying this mineral, and under torture, he told me of its power. lt'll make you feel more alive, more complete, than you've ever felt-- it'll light you up from inside. Literally turn you into... a god. And give you the power... to fly. lncredible. As you can see, it's unstable. But that's only because l don't know how to use it yet. Besides, l only have enough for this magic trick. We need more, lots more. The only problem is, we can't get near the tree spirits. They're protected by the Kaw mountains on one side and the savages on the other. Join me, Hook. l badly need fresh blood, and you bring knowledge from a modern world. You help me defeat the savages, and together we can rule Neverland like gods... and turn this endless purgatory into an eternal paradise. Gods? Yes... gods. What are you doing up here, Starkey? Don't the captain need you tonight? Leave me alone! Oh, dear. There must be a way down. We will build you and your friend a hut. Thank you. Why live up here? To be near the tree spirits. That is their city. We protect them from the pirates. How do you get down to the sea from here? The same way you were brought in, through a secret passage through those mountains. Will you show me? lf you try to rescue your friends, the pirates will capture and torture you until you show them the mountain passage. But l can't just sit on my hands. l'm the one that got them into this mess, l've got to find a way to get them home and safe. There is no way home. What? No. There is a way back. There must be. Fox! Fox, l have a plan. - For what? - To get us out of here and onto that ship. Come on. See what they're carrying? Fishing nets. So? Have you seen any fishing waters around here? No. Exactly. l don't understand. That's how we're gonna find the secret passage through the mountains. Come on. My God! Look at the size of it! Grab on to that. Quick, grab on to it. Shh! Quiet. Do you see Jimmy? No. How are we gonna get 'em out, Peter? They're surrounded by pirates. Yeah, but sleeping pirates. Drunk, sleeping pirates. - Peter! - Peter, you're here! Peter! Shh. Shh. Come on. l'm not going anywhere with you. - Shut it, Curly. He's here to help. - Yeah, well, we don't need his help. Yeah, he's the one who got us into this mess in the first place. Well, l'm the one that's getting you out. You want to stay, fine. You want to live, follow us. Did l ever tell you my recipe for turtle soup? Please, Smee. Shh! Hey... Something, she is not right. What? l'm going to go look around. l wouldn't do that if l was you, not up there in Bonny's cabin. Thank you. Where's Jimmy? The captain's quarters. - Are you sure? - She's got a shine for him. "She"? - Where you goin', Peter? - To get Jimmy. But we're all here. We can make a clean getaway if we go now. l'm not going without Jimmy. Where's Jimmy? Peter! How did you get here? Get your clothes on. l've got a canoe waiting below. Put the pistol down, Peter. Bonny's a friend. - Bonny? - How many more in your litter, Hook? Let me speak to him. l didn't know he was here. Give me the gun, Peter. - Wait, Starkey. - Peter, give me the gun! Tell him to put his away first! Listen to me, Peter. Captain Bonny and her men are on our side. She's assured me that the boys will be well looked after. The lndians say they're crazy. - lndians? - He's with the savages. Trust me, Peter, they're anything but crazy. These are our people. lt's a dangerous place, they can help us survive. - Do you want to stay here? With her? - We've nowhere else to go. We can stay with the lndians until we find a way home. - They'll scalp and skin the lot of ya. - No, they won't! They're good people! - How do you know? - They're kind! Listen to me, Peter. l'm staying here. lf you want to stick with me, give me the gun. l don't trust them, Jimmy. So trust me. Give me the gun. Come on! Leave him be. Hook! Leave it. You little rat! You... piccolo ratto! Your boys are gone, Smee. But l captured this one. He's not one of my boys! Hook - he had him working behind our backs. What did you do with my boys?! Leave him be! He's just a boy! He doesn't know what he's doing. l'm gonna keelhaul him if he don't tell me what he's done with my boys! Where are the others, Peter? Hm? We must all stick together. Not here. Not with these crazies. Shh shh shh. You're safe with me. Now let's go inside, get something to eat and forget this foolishness. Hmm? Peter! - Oi! Come here! - Get back here! Come back here! Aaaah! Unhand me! Where is he? Where are you? Aha! Fox! Run! Run, Fox! There! Quick! Quick, hurry! Come on, come on! Quick! Row faster! Quickly! Quickly! Faster! Quickly! Peter! - Over here, Peter! - Come on! - Come on! Let's go! - But Fox is up there! He came back for you. Jump! Jump! lf you jump now, you'll make the canoe. Jump, Fox! Unhh! Fox. Fox! Peter! Peter... We trusted you, gave you the freedom of our village. And you abused that trust. Stole two canoes and used the mountain passage without our consent. l should punish you, but in light of your loss, l will be lenient this time. l want to find them. Things have come a long way since l terrorized the Spanish Main. What else is new? Flying machines? Where is this lndian settlement? You would choose the boys over me? l'm responsible for them, l brought them here. - They look up to me. - What will you do when you find them? They're clever. Trained in the streets, pickpockets. They could be useful to us, help us find the mineral dust. "Us"? l've never met anyone like you. And what about her? You forgotten already? She passed away many years ago. But you still carry her portrait. She had hold of me once. Now l have you. l'll give you what you want, Hook, but only if you give me what l want. There is no "us." Understand? l'll let you live because l want to know what you know-- all 200 years of it. You lied to us. We never should have broken into Harbottle's. - You were just showing off to Jimmy. - And now we're stuck here. - Wherever "here" is. - And you got Fox killed. - Curly! - We were all in that canoe. All right? We could have all got away, but he had to go back for Jimmy. What's the point of rubbing it in? Curly's right. l got Fox killed. No, no, no, no. lt should go... At the end, up, not down. You know this tune? Come. Where did you see this? ln here. A dream. The same dream every night. You have the dream too, don't you? Uh-huh. That music, it's the sound of tree spirit wings. He's holding the orb, isn't he? That isn't quite right. The peaks were different in my dream. Draw it. lt's something like-- No. Can l try? Something like this? Do you have the dream too? No. But l hunt and fish. We call that Bull Mountain. We've never been there. lt's too far away. But we can see it on a clear day when we pass the outer islands. So the hooded man was in Neverland. - Why do we have the same dream? - How did you get to Neverland? - l hit the orb with my dagger. - Me too, with the staff. l hit it so hard l brought the whole tribe with me. Perhaps part of its great power enters those who strike it. Do you think the hooded man is still there? How do l get to this island? - l'm coming with you. - No, Toots. lt's too dangerous. l don't care. But l do. l've done enough damage. Look, it's just a dream. lt'll probably turn out to be a wild-goose chase, but if l do find a way home, l'll be back for you and the others, okay? What do l tell them? To sit tight and wait for me. And that l promise l'll do everything l can to get them home safe. We'll find the mineral dust here, in the tree spirit colony. But the problem is, it's within the Kaw territory. The mountains from the north to the east are impregnable, and tall cliffs line the Kaw. So there's no way through. - How do the lndians get in and out? - We don't know. We can watch them cook on their campfires from across a narrow ravine, but if we try to rope across they will pick us off like gulls on a gaff rig. They hunt on this part of the island, going back and forth as if these mountains weren't even there. Any ideas? Perhaps we should watch them a little more closely. The chief's daughter is a prize indeed. She'll tell us how to get into the tree spirit colony. l'll send some men to cut them off. No. Sometimes smaller is smarter. They're up to something. Let's find out what first. He was standing on a hill in front of the mountain. There must be a hundred hills here. Let's try that one. l find it! The prints go this way. Right, then. Let's go. Your family back home must be very worried about you. l don't have a family. My mother died when l was three and l never knew my father. So l was brought up in a workhouse. ls that where you met your friends? Nah. No, l was the only kid there. "Punchbag", they called me. Jimmy fished me out. He was visiting one day and saw me getting a kicking. He was a good man once. The best. He saved my life, but... that pirate turned his head. Recognize anything? lt wasn't as overgrown in my dream. Let's find a place to rest. lt'll be dark soon. Wait! lt's the tree spirit from my dream! Come on! She might lead us to the hooded man! See her? - No. - She's too fast. l've never seen a tree spirit glow like that. She's really beautiful. Oh, no. What? The sun's coming up. Now we're never gonna find her. l've never seen anything like this. We've got to find a way in. He must be in there. How are you at climbing? lt's a mile high. Then we better get started. lt's incredible. Do you see anyone down there? No. Come on. Down is sometimes harder than up. Where is everyone? They'll come to us. How do you know? Anyone clever enough to make all this already knows we're here. That's right. You. You're the hooded man! Hello, Peter. Can you get us home? Of course. Now that l'm here, everything shall find its proper place. You have the orb? ln a manner of speaking. Hmm? Finally, after almost 350 years, it's back where it belongs. Now we can start to bring the elite of our world here to my utopia. So how will you get us back? Patience, young friend. - You made all this? - Mm-hm. lt's easier than it looks. A simple growth solution which compels the forest to grow... in the way that l want it to grow. - Who are you? - My apologies. My name is Dr. Richard Fludd. Alchemist to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the First. What? Hard to believe, l know, but l am almost 400 years old. Come, l'll show you my life's work. lt's only a few hours old. l was engaged in the search for the philosopher's stone, the elixir believed to grant everlasting life. There were others like me, of course, but they were all trying to make a tangible substance which could be consumed in some way. What l discovered was that the philosopher's stone cannot be made-- it has to be trapped. You see, it's a form of cosmic energy which lives at the very center of the universe... where its four corners meet. This is the shape of the universe. And here... at its center... is this tiny planet. - Neverland. - Mmm. And because it lives at the farthest reaches of the universe, as well as at its center, time stands still for all those who come here. So how do we get back? Ah. When l first arrived on this planet, l was stuck here, because, of course, the orb that l'd made in London remained there. But as you know, the harder you strike the orb, the more it... So thankfully, most of the contents of my laboratory traveled with me, and in time, l was able to build a twin. l activated it here in Neverland with the power from two meteors. lt's just like the other one. l call her Tinker Bell... because of the beautiful sound her wings make through the air. When she saw me harnessing the astral energy of two meteors, she thought l was in trouble and tried to save me. That's my dream. All who activate the orb are imprinted with that memory. Why does she glow so bright? Well, much of that astral energy is trapped inside her. Hmm. Come. We'll take the orb below. There's an open area where l can send you both back. No. Not yet. l've got to find my friends. Seems l have more guests. lncredible. What's it all for? Mi sento il diavolo. Attenzione. There could be demons lurking behind these walls. No. Only me. That's the man in my dream. Fludd. You know him? Dr. Fludd. Where's Peter? Please lay down your weapons. This is a sanctuary. You're in no danger here. Why such a big city forjust one man? lt will soon be filled with the elite of our world-- artists, statesmen, philosophers. What the hell for? Think what great minds can achieve if they have the rest of eternity to study. - Can you help us get back to London? - Yes. Did you send Peter back already? Not yet. Then where is he? As l said, this is a sanctuary. All who enter here are granted my protection. lf you lay down your weapons, l can start to prepare your return. l don't want to go back. No? Who wants to return to the Caribbean? Do you think we'd still strike terror into men's hearts? Tell them, Hook. Tell them how it's changed. We wouldn't last a week. And if we did, we'd grow old, quickly, in a world that we no longer understand. ls that what you want? - No, of course not. - No! But we don't want legions of pompous braggarts coming here either with their fancy new weapons, telling us how to live our lives, no. Now, you tell me how it's done. ls there a door? Or another sphere like the one that brought us here? lf you don't want to use it, why do you care? Because, Dr. Fludd... l want to police it. l won't allow that to happen. l won't tolerate violence. Lay down your weapons. Gunpowder and lead have no place here. Leave now, and your lives will be spared! Shoot them! Shoot them all! You are dealing with forces beyond your understanding. Run! Run for your lives! Peter! Peter, wait! l need to talk to you! Peter! Over here. Make your way for the door, men! This way! Dr. Fludd? lt took me almost a century to grow my city. Look how quickly it disappears. Where's Aaya? l don't know. Try and save the orb. l'll face them here. Go, go, go. Go! Go! Aaaah! l don't want to hurt you, Fludd, l just want to see Peter safe. Engaging you, Hook, was a terrible mistake. The glass sphere, Fludd. Where is it? l'd rather burn in hell. You're responsible for this! No! Peter! Move! Aaya! Where are you, Aaya?! Going back? - You can't have it. - What makes you think l want it? l heard your girlfriend. You don't want people going back. That doesn't mean you, Peter. l'll make sure you get back safely. Then let me take it back to my crew. l have a better idea. Why don't they come to us? Us? Who's "us"? The pirates?! Because they will kill them! Just like they-- Just like they killed Fox. That was a terrible mistake. l tried to stop it. You let it happen! You've become one of them! Listen to me, Peter. There's something in this world that will completely change our lives in London, make us more powerful than you can ever imagine. And Bonny and her men can help us find it. She's turned your head, Jimmy. Give me that knife. l taught you too well. l swear, Peter, l will run you through if you don't calm down and let me explain what l found here! You don't care about me. You just want that woman! You couldn't be more wrong. l didn't pull you out of that workhouse because l took pity on you, Peter-- l did it because of the debt l owed... to your mother. You--You knew my mother? Very well. This is my mother? l vowed to bring you up and rear you as my own. And l won't give up on you now. This is her watch? lt was your father's. l hate to break up such a touching reunion, but we have to get out of here. Give me another minute with him, Liz. There is no time. The place is a tinderbox. lt's even more beautiful than l remember. No! No! Peter! Hey, you! Hey, you! Wait! Ha! Come on! Leave him be! - Where is the squaw?! - Tell them, Peter. l wouldn't tell your girlfriend the time of day! l will give you one last chance to redeem yourself. Stop! Let him live... and l will tell you what you want to know. And what is that? How to get into the tree spirit colony... and the secret of the mineral dust. No, Aaya! Run! Agghh! And you'll do this... just to keep him alive? Only if you set him free. Aaya, run! Tie her up. Come on, Aaya! Run! - Peter! - No! No! No! No! There. l set him free. Now let's get out of here. Dear God.
