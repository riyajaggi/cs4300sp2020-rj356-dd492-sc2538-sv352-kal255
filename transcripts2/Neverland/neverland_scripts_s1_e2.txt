 Neverland (2011): Season 1, Episode 2 - Part 2 - full transcript 
 As the pirates return to their ship Tinker Bell takes the injured Peter to the tree spirit colony where he is dipped into a pool of mineral dust which heals him and gives him the power to fly. Faking friendship and claiming to have broken with his shipmates Hook persuades Peter to show him the pool but when Bonny bathes in it it kills her as she is not innocent, like Peter. Peter and Tinker Bell lead the boys and the Indians in a battle against Hook's pirates, during which Peter cuts off Hook's right hand, which is eaten by a crocodile. Following his victory Peter disappears but some while later reappears, with Tinker Bell, wearing a suit. He tells them that he has managed to activate the orb and enable himself to travel between Neverland and London. In the process however he has lost his shadow.

 Now l see why you were so protective of the boy. But you mustn't brood, Hook. The stars have finally shifted in our favor. When Starkey's finished with the chief's daughter... oh, she'll tell us whatever we need to know. No, she won't talk. Not now. Well, Starkey's never let me down. This is the tree spirit colony here, right? Surrounded by impregnable mountains. What about this narrow ravine by the Kaw settlement? Fifty feet wide.

 We can rope across. Nope. We'd be sitting ducks. Not if we bring that princess hostage. That's a big risk. A risk worth taking. We set off at first light. Ready ten of your best men. l am captain. l will decide what's best. You listen to me! Now that l have the orb, l intend to return to London, but not before l have the power of the mineral dust coursing through my veins. l will be a god amongst men, and rule over the same London society that banished me to the fringes of the East End.

 Countless scores will be settled. You have a choice, Liz. Stand with me and have all the thrills of the modern world at your fingertips, or remain here and rule over the living dead for the rest of eternity. Now you are like us. - Where am l? - My kingdom. - You speak English? - No. l'm using my mind, Peter. Thoughts have no language. But the mineral dust gives you the power to hear our people. - What happened to Aaya? - The pirates have her. Easy, Peter. The elders have closed your wound, but it's not yet healed. - That will take many days. - l'm so cold. Your clothes are ready, repaired with silk from our farms. Come. You must go before the three elders who rule our kingdom. Your kind pose a great threat to our world. So we ask for your help. Find the magic orb and bring it to us. We will use it to send home your kind. Your new powers will help in this endeavor. Powers? Close your eyes, Peter. Breathe softly. Clear your mind. lmagine you're floating in a warm sea, drifting safely, and you're blissfully happy... so happy you don't even feel the water under you, just a warm breeze holding you up... up... Aaah! Aaaah! Oh, my--aaaah! No, Peter! You must stay relaxed! Close your eyes again. Peter, breathe normally. Trust in yourself. Good! Clear your mind. Picture the clouds around you, feel the wind on your face. The wind is your friend, Peter, the wind carries you. Now open your eyes. How is it happening? You are doing it, Peter. The mineral dust gives you the power, but you must control it. - How? - With your heart. lt responds to the way you feel, but if you doubt yourself, it will falter. Look down, Peter. Our world suffers. Help us. Get us the magic orb so we can stop this brutality. - Why me? - You still have an innocent heart, Peter. lt's a quality we share, and trust. Crossing that ravine is a foolish waste of time. lt's likely to get us all killed! Your courage has always impressed, Starkey. The ravine is a death trap. So stay here! Darn your socks! What has happened to you, Liz? Hmm? Ahem! You're wearing my best suit of clothes. Not anymore. l should have dropped you when l had the chance. Then drop me now. Hmm. That's a coward's weapon. l'd prefer it if you killed me with a sword. Here. You can use mine. Look at your men! Do you see any of them run to your defense? Hmm? Two hundred years on the same boat, and no one cares if you live or die. You're mine now. You understand? This is amazing! Ha ha ha! Whoa! Steady, Peter! Let the wind guide you. Peter! Lean into the breeze! You're going too fast! Remember, short, fast breaths. Aaah! Aaaah! Aah aaah! Look out! Aaah...whoa! Ohh! Peter, are you all right? Peter. Boo! Got ya. l can't teach you if you act like a child. Yeah, but l thought that's what you liked about me. You need to rest. Your wound will take many days to heal. l've got to go now, Tink. Rescue Aaya and get back to my crew. Your crew? My friends. They're the ones l'll get home first once l've found the orb. You're not ready, Peter. The sun's going down. We can't rope across in the dark. We'd better stop for the night. lf l do find a way home, l'll be back for you and the others. So how do we get back? Tie her up! - Now we're stuck here! - Wherever "here" is. Aaya, run! Bloody hell. Ooh, my God! Sweet mother of-- - What do you want here, specter? - The alchemist's glass orb. Fetch it-- l will spare your life. l don't know where it is. None of us do. The captain hid it somewhere on shore. lf you don't own up, pirate, you'll be wearing your tonsils for earrings! Now, listen, they wouldn't bring it onboard, it's too sensitive, so they buried it somewhere on Bull lsland. "They"? Yeah. Captain Bonny and Master Hook. Well, you must have some idea where it is. They took it out in the middle of the night. l swear to you, specter, they are the only ones that know where it is. Very well. Fetch the chief's daughter, and l will leave you in peace. Oh, God. Keep moving, men! This is the ravine here! Yes, but the lndian village is further along. Well, this looks unguarded. lf we cross here, we can go around them. lt's unguarded because the web was made by man-eating spiders. Then we should cross with care! l'd rather face a few spiders than a hundred angry braves. Aaah! Pull her up! l'm trying. Aah! Come over and help me! lt's been a-cut by a knife. Aaah! Aaaah! How did you do that? What's wrong? l'm fine. l'm fine. - l'm fine. - The mineral dust. lt's in your skin. Wait here. l'll come back for you and we'll climb up together. ls it really you? Back from the dead. How did you survive? l have friends in high places. Santa Madonna! The mineral dust-- he's covered in it! You were saved by the tree spirits? And l see you've become one of them. Fludd's orb, Jimmy-- where did you hide it? l can't tell you here. Hurting me won't help, Peter. You're right. But hurting your girlfriend might. - You're not a murderer, Peter! - Aaaah! Perhaps l've changed! Aaaah! Aah! All l have to do is cut the rope, and down you go. Now, l know it's on Bull lsland... but where? l said where?! Wait! Don't pull her up yet. He'll cut the rope. Stop! Aah! Well? What's it to be, Jimmy? Pull her up now! We have to take him with us. He knows the secret of the mineral dust. See, l knew it was possible to take their power. Oh... Wake up, boy. Wake up. There's more than the flying, isn't there? Hmm? The power lives inside you, doesn't it? lt nourishes you from inside. Now, you tell me what that's like. Wake up. Wake up. How did you do it? What did you do? What did you do?! He's getting weaker. His wound has opened up. l've tried to dress it, but... l want it. l want it! We're finished, Hook. l have lost eleven men since you arrived. And for what? A wild-goose chase to nowhere! - Peter will help us now. - He probably won't even survive the night. You have worked your charm on me for the last time, Hook! No! Starkey! Keep him alive... till l've decided my next move. Jimmy took him back to the pirate ship? l think so. l'm sorry. He's back with the pirates. They saved him from the spider, so they must have wanted him alive. A gift. l'm not wearing that. Me neither. Why not? They're tougher than our old clothes. We have to get Peter out-- like he got us out. Don't be daft. Have you forgotten what he did to Fox? And you want the same to happen to Peter? Let's show a little bottle. They're two peas in a pod, if you ask me. Peter always wanted to stand shoulder to shoulder with Jimmy. Now he's got his wish. lt's not the same without him. No. lt's a lot safer. Who's gonna take his place? You? - We'd be better off. - You don't have it in ya. Oh, we'll see. Tomorrow l'll lead the croc hunt, and when l bring one of them beasties in, the lndians will make me a blood brother, and then, perhaps, you'll show me some respect. You signed up for the croc hunt? Come on, Curly, you said you'd do it. Run, Curly! Boys. Where's Curly? Xyhal has something to give you. The first time he faced Xaw, he was so scared he ran and didn't return to the village for many days. When he did, l told him, "Fear is good. Fear is part of us." But he was too ashamed to listen. Today you helped Xyhal prove to us that he has great courage after all. For this, he is very grateful. He wants you to have his father's bear tooth. Ohh! Peter. Peter, are you okay? Jimmy? Shh. Drink. l'm so sorry, Peter, l've been a complete fool. Come on. Put your arm around me. l'm taking you home. Feeling better? How did we get here? Berry water. Not as sweet as it sounds. l challenged the lads to a drinking game. There'll be a few sore heads this morning. What happened? Well, after that, it was easy to steal a rowing boat and-- No, um... l mean, what happened to you? l woke up. And your lady friend? She'll have to find someone else to wrap around her little finger. l thought l'd lost you, Peter. And although l hated Bonny for what she did, l had nowhere else to go. l can't deny she had a hold on me, she's a... very... hypnotic woman. But when l saw you... alive... l woke up. Now all l want to do is get us home safely... go back to things as they were. Hmm? Ohh. Here. lt's a bit chewy, but it tastes good when you're hungry. Hmm. What now? We gather up the lads and hurry to the caves on Bull lsland before Bonny figures out where we've gone. The caves? A weird place. A labyrinth. But the perfect place to hide the orb. Are you ready to go home, Peter? Yeah. Can you walk? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, no, l think so. Unh! Ow! - Which way? - You tell me. Where are the lads? This way. Jenny was the most beautiful woman l'd ever met. - How did you meet? - At the Granville Club. l was in the arms trade-- respectable, well-off. She was treading the boards. Only the best West End theaters, mind you. - And my dad? - He came later. Stole her away from me. No hard feelings. l always knew she was too good for me. What was he like? - Look in the mirror. - l look like him? l always thought you looked like your mother. Now l see him. That's because l'm finally growing up. What happened to him? All l know is he died before you were born. When l heard, l went looking for Jenny, tracked her down to the workhouse. Got there five years too late. And you wound up with me instead. The consolation prize. When we get back... it'll be like old times, won't it, Jimmy? Working the East End, you know? Apart from l won't have to climb up no rooftops no more-- l can just fly up. Yes, that'll come in very handy. Shh. There's a scout 50 yards away, halfway up a tree. How do you know? l can feel it. l can feel a lot of things now. What else can you do? Shh. We'll go this way. Don't look like much from out here, but inside it's huge. And it goes all the way through the mountains? lt's not as far as you'd think, but it's dark. We'll need torches. No. l'll light the way. There's a lookout on each end. - Just one? - Yeah. But one can turn into twenty in a heartbeat, so l better go talk to him, tell him why l'm here with a pirate. Hello. Peter? Yeah, yeah, that's right. l'm Peter. What are you doing? No, get off me! Are you crazy? Stop! ls this the only scout? - There's another at the end of the passage. - No! You can't tell them that! l'm sorry, Peter. This way no one gets hurt. lt was all a trick? lt was the only way l could get you to cooperate. Like it or not, you're still a child. There are some things you'll never understand. - Yeah, like betraying your friends?! - l just want what you've got! You've redeemed yourself in spades, Hook. Perhaps l was too quick to doubt. We should hurry. lt'll be clinical, we'll be in and out before anyone notices. - l trusted you. - You've done the right thing, Peter. Believe me, it'll all turn out for the best, l promise. Now come on. lt's even more beautiful than l imagined. Where are they? Over there. Ready, men? Ready. - What are they doing? - lt's just something to ward them off. No. Now, Starkey! You're killing them! They shouldn't come so close! Then they wouldn't get hurt! You murderers! - Get off me! Get off me! - Keep still! Where do we find the mineral dust? Shh. Look, we can't undo what we've done, but once we have what we came for, we'll disappear back to London. Don't you see? The best way to get rid of us is by telling us what we want to know. You promise to leave forever? The mineral. lt's in the rock. How do we get it out? You swim through it. Give me some room. Where will she come out? There. Take him. Hurry, Hook. lt'll transform you. lt's everything l dreamed of. What went wrong? What happened? l don't know. She did everything exactly as l did. - Except... - Except what?! The tree spirits were here then, singing a strange song. You're just like your father! Self-righteous, smug! And l see through your innocence just as l saw through his! What are you talking about? You think l'd let him get away with humiliating me?! Stealing my girl?! Oh, there were no hard feelings once l cut him open like a Christmas goose! You killed my father! He had his chance! lt was a fair duel! So why did you take me? l loved your mother. And l saw her in you. Stupidly thought l could ease the guilt by rearing you as my own! But all l raised was another one just like him! Head for the woods! 4,000 years lost in one night. l'm sorry. They tricked me. You wanted to give them what we gave you-- please the one called Hook, allowed his greed and ambition to corrupt your innocent heart. - l made a mistake. - A mistake which has cost us dear. For that, you must pay. You shall walk for the rest of eternity without any memory of who you are, where you came from, or those you loved. Your innocence, the innocence we recognized and trusted, will be your only guide, raw and heartless. Listen carefully. You will feel great loss, grief, torture, distress, heartache, suffering... Stop! He can still help us! This won't accomplish anything! Let him be! Peter. Peter, are you all right? The alchemist has given you a great power, and you use it on your own kind. l'm sorry. When l get angry, l can't control it. You have broken a sacred covenant, and are no longer welcome amongst us. Peter. Was l too late? Peter! Tinker Bell. Oh... Ha ha ha! Gibberish, gibberish, gibberish! l can speak gibberish too, you know? - Peter, are you all right? - Never better. Who are your friends? Why are you in fancy dress? ls there a party? Hey! Let go of me! How many? Another two dead and three wounded. This is your doing, Hook. We have been on a slippery slope ever since you have appeared. And l have watched you while you have dragged us in every direction... except the right one. Sent some of our best men to their deaths. What is that thing you say? "Smaller is sometimes smarter," yes? l think it's time we tested this theory. You see, without you, we are a smaller group. But much, much smarter. l have two shots... and there are five of you. Who will it be? How about you, Starkey? You could take me... if you had the guts. Just because it didn't turn out how we wanted doesn't mean we have to give up. l could get more men here in days, heavily armed with Gatling guns and grenades and fire in their hearts! Fifty, a hundred, perhaps a thousand! We can overrun the lndians and force the tree spirits to give up the secret of the mineral dust. And where will you get these men from? l'll go back to London. Recruit them from the streets. Believe me, there are many who would give their right arm to be shot of the London gutter forever. No, no, no, no, you're not listening to this, are you, men? You don't fall for this again? This is just more of his...ehh...lies! lf we let him out of our sight, you will never see him again. So come with me. Eh? He's the only one who knows where the alchemist's orb is. And how to get us back from London. Join me, Starkey. Come see what pleasures the modern world has to offer. Believe me, you won't be disappointed. We can't just leave him down there. Say we do get him out. What then? Run for the hills? Live in the wild? - We'd starve. - Peter wouldn't let that happen. Peter's ga-ga. He-He lost his marbles so they threw him in the pit. And he's a traitor. He led the pirates through the mountain passage. The lndians know what they're doing, Toots. Three months back, Tom McKenna and his gang had me trapped down a blind alley. There was four of them and only one of me. And they had knives. "Let's make him suffer," said Tom. l knew l was dead. l started whistling our S.O.S. song. You know, the Marseillaise. l didn't think any of you would hear me, but...then... out of nowhere, Peter appeared. "We're in luck, lads," says Tom. "Two for the price of one." And... l looked at Peter, and he smiled back. No fear, nothing-- just that cocky smile. "Go ahead," he says. "Try it. "And tomorrow fifty snipes just like us will come "looking for you." l didn't know about that. Peter kept it quiet. Didn't want to show me up. Look, we survived the streets because we stuck together, and we looked out for each other even when the odds were stacked against us. l thought the rules might work different here... but they don't. Peter. Get off! Get off me! Peter, it's us. Who are you ugly mugs? Hold on, l'll throw you a rope. You can fly? What do you want with me, lndians? Come on, Peter, we've got to get out of here. l'm not going anywhere until you tell me who you are. Hey! Get off me! - Oi! - Hold him down! Let's try this one more time. Your name's Peter. You grew up in the East End, and you're the best set-up man on the street. lf you don't let me go, my people will come looking for you. He thinks he's a flipping tree spirit. Do tree spirits speak English? Untie me! l knew this was a bad idea. Hello, Peter. l see you've all gone native. Peter! Welcome back! Hurry, lads! We've got work to do. We thought it'd be safer higher up. Where's Aaya? Home. ln the village. Don't you remember? She tried to stand up for you, but they were too angry. What do we do now, Peter? You can't get over these mountains, there's nothing but ice and rock up there. And you can't go back down into the forest, so... you're gonna have to sit tight. And you? You know that glass orb Jimmy found in Harbottle's? There's one just like it here, and it can get us all home. Where is it? That's the bad news. Jimmy hid it in some caves in Bull lsland. But l'm gonna find it and bring it here. How? - What are you doing here? - l was going to ask you the same question. - Did you believe him? - Who, Hook? l don't have to. l'll be shadowing him the whole way. What if he can't press-gang an army off the streets like he says he can? Then we come home without him. Once we've passed this peninsula, Bull lsland should be straight ahead. Sí. They're going to the orb, Peter. lf we sit tight, they'll take us right to it. Then what? Snatch it from under their noses? No! We wait for them to use it. Once they're gone, the orb will be ours. But then they'll come back to Neverland with an army and wipe out the lndians. lf we can deliver the orb to the grand elders, they might forgive us. But what about the lndians? The elders will use the orb to get rid of the pirates. And imagine, if he can do what he says he can, and we show up with a thousand men and them guns, and bombs and all---- the lndians won't know what hit 'em. l have to warn them. Peter! Aaya. Hook and the pirates are planning to use Fludd's orb to bring an army to Neverland and... wipe you out. So...was it all an act? You playing a fool? Of course not. And what about leading the pirates to the mountain pass? Was that you? They tricked me. Really? How? Listen, we don't have much time. They're on their way to Bull lsland now. You've got to get everyone together and stop them before they get there. l'll try and stall them somehow, but... l can't fight them on my own. Fight them? Why would you want to fight them? l thought you were with them. Did you really think that we'd get in our boats and go out into the ocean so you and your friends could have a little target practice? You really think l'd do that to you? - What happened? - We're on our own. We'll do it your way. No, no, no, only as much as they can carry. l thought it was just you and me, Starkey. Then you tell them yourself. There's not a man here who doesn't want to visit home. What if the lndians take the ship while we're gone? We'll have nothing to come back to. Look, once we have control of Fludd's London orb, we can come back and forth as we please. Everyone will have their turn. lncluding you, Mr. Smee. - l'm not staying! - And l'm not leaving anyone else in charge. - Oh, leave-- - Look. l'll bring you back a little treat, okay? Some--A nice bottle of rumbullion, perhaps. And an Eccles cake. A whole sack. You're on. But l'm not going alone, Hook. Pensi che sia stupido? You might know what we will find there--l do not. Half a dozen men only, you understand? l don't care how you choose them, Starkey, but any more, we'll be too conspicuous. Va bene. Hear that? - Hear what? - That. Aaaaah! Get off me! Get off! What is Peter doing? We won't hurt you. You are our friends. But l need to know what Peter is planning. Not a word, Toots. He came to me a short time ago, told me that the pirates are planning to bring an army from your world. Listen, if Peter is telling the truth, we are all in terrible danger. He went to find the orb. All right? To get us all home. That's all l know. Where? The caves on Bull lsland. Jimmy used to work in the arms trade. He's got a mate in the Woolwich arsenal who can get anything for a price. Grenades... - What is this? - lt's spread by the wind. Won't even see it coming. lt'll choke you to death before you know it's there. We don't take children. We can look after ourselves. You'll get in the way. Then l don't need this. Very well. Bloody hell. All hands on deck! Man the cannon! Watch your step. Fire! Oh, mio dio. l don't like the look of this. Twins! Come on! All we have to do is wait until they've gone and the orb will be ours. Are you ready? l'm sorry, Tink. l can't let this happen. What? Oh--oh--aaah! You've interfered one time too many. Help! Help me! Pull! Give me that. Hold still. Ohh! Unhh! Where's Hook?! They're long gone. You're too late, lndian. And when they get back, you're all dead. Hook's not on the ship. They're already in the caves! Look for tracks! Where are you, you little rat? We're wasting time. Let them fight on in the streets of London. No! Where has he gone? Over there. Hold your fire! The cave's not safe! Come on, Hook. Let's leave him and go. Not until we've dealt with Peter. Otherwise we leave the orb in his hands. The tracks lead this way. Hurry! lt looks like they went this way! Hold your fire! He's mine. Hold him still! No, Tink! Get out of there! Vermin. Here he comes. ln here! Hide! Hide! Hey! Over there! On the ledge! Tink? We shouldn't fight, Peter. This is silly. Call off the lndians and the lads so we can join forces. We were...a team once. We can join forces again, only this time it'll be different, this time we'll be partners. lsn't that what you always wanted? Stand with me, Peter-- as my equal, my friend, and together we'll rule over London. Peter. Take my hand, Peter. You killed my father. And you lied to me my whole life! Be careful! You might hit Peter! - Come back down to earth. - Down to your level! l'm gonna beat you without any help! Be careful! Quick! Curly, look out! Aaaaah! Arrghhhh! Ohhh! Ohhh! Finish me off. No. l'm not like you. Come on! Be a man! Never. My father's watch. Oh, Peter! Peter! Enough of this. Out of my way! - No! - Unhh! Ahhh! Run! lt's coming down! - lt's coming down! Run! - Go! Peter! You've got to get out! Tink? Run! Run! Get out of here! Come on, Peter. Where's Peter? lt landed in the water... ...l think. We have to jump. lt's our only chance. Hmmm. Hmm. So, my friend... ...if we get out of this alive, what will you use for a hand, Hook? What? ls this our home for the rest of eternity? What will we do with ourselves? A gift for your bravery. Paddles! Thanks. l've always wanted one of these. Not just a paddle, Twins. There's a canoe to go with them. Now that the last of the pirates have been banished to the Outer lslands, the sea is safe. Thank you, Aaya. What's that noise? S-Sounds like-- Peter! Oh! Hello, lads! - How did you get out the cave? - The orb took a bit of a knock. - You went back to London? - Yep. And l got you all something. One of them newfangled pen knives for you, Slightly. The Arabian Nights for Mr. Toots. A Greenwich mountain compass for you, Nibs. Curly... harmonica. And Foxton's Pocket Encyclopedia for you, Twins. Two copies. And new shoes for everyone. And the orb? Buried under a thousand tons of earth, l expect. How did you get back, then? l paid a visit to Fludd's friends. When they weren't looking, l borrowed their orb, and, er, hid it in a part of London no one would ever think to look. Why, Peter? Because l promised a friend l'd keep the aliens away. But why did you come back? Now you're stuck here. l wasn't gonna leave you snipes to have all the fun without me. What fun? Are you mad? Neverland is filled with adventures. We haven't even scratched the surface. There's a million islands, with a different adventure on each and every one. And d'you know what the best part is? We never have to grow up. We can do whatever we like, live by our rules, with no adults here to cheat us. This is our world, pure and fair. Now, l'm going off to look for a secret camp. All who's with me, raise your right hand and shout, "Neverland!" Neverland! Peter... look. Where's your shadow?
