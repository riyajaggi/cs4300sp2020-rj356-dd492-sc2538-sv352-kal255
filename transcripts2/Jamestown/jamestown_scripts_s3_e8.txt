 The King's signet. Why did you not use it to free yourself? Then they would know all there is to know. He's vanished, as a vapour does. You promised me you would not love me, but I saw it in your eyes as you healed my wound. My king will send Pamunkey. The Governor has Pamunkey labour. Yes, ma'am. The other farms also have Naturals. You're a rat. You got no ma and no pa, because you ain't worthy of none and you never will be! I made it clear to him I cannot give my heart.

 I did it once and it broke me. Never again. (FIRE CRACKLING) (SPEAKING ALGONQUIAN) (CHACROW SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) (BOTH SPEAKING ALGONQUIAN) Did you disturb my wife, Chacrow? Speak. When will I be done with your calling on my family? Winganuske must visit our village. You will cease deciding what must be. Do you understand? Henry, I have a child. I carry a baby for you. Then I will take you to your Pamunkey kin. No. Chacrow.

 You do not appear a man who loves such good news. Why is that? Speak. Speak. I will have you tell me the darkness I see in your eyes. (SPEAKING ALGONQUIAN) (ALL CHEERING AND CLAPPING) Oh! (APPLAUSE) (HUMMING) If only we could all reap such pleasure in our penance as Mercy does. Huh. It's not the repentance that fills her heart, but the sin of getting herself with child. Well, the prospect of losing such a faithful maid must pain you, Jocelyn. I'll find another girl, once Mercy is married. (CONTINUES HUMMING) Have you summoned me here, sir, to gloat that I returned from upriver empty-handed? Widow, you were a valiant foe. For a woman. Is there still no word, Governor... ..of where Master Crabtree vanished to? Defiance might bring a thrill to your cheek, widow, but wars are won with might. I employed scouts and assassins to follow after him. The factor is dead. His body is, this moment, travelling to us. Now, I know that you are defeated, widow, and you know that you are humbled. But the world must see it. From this day hence, you will curtsey when you approach me. Now, let's see how you look when you bend the knee. (GRUNTS) I think you can do better than that. Lower, hm? Lower. (SPEAKING ALGONQUIAN) (ALL WHOOPING) (HUMMING) Ma'am, will you be the one who breaks the cake over my head at my wedding? (CHUCKLES) Yes. (SIGHS, CHUCKLES) I witnessed Master Read showing his forge to a man who appeared to be a blacksmith. Oh, yes, that's the new smithy. (CONTINUES HUMMING) Is James Read to take on an apprentice? Oh, no, ma'am. He's selling his forge. I will make the cake so that it crumbles up beautiful. Then James Read intends to take on another position in Jamestown? Master Read is leaving, ma'am, going upriver to another settlement. (HUMMING) Have you come to pray to a boulder, Mistress Rutter? I saw their king here, sir. Opechancanough. He was laying tobacco and the like. They believe there's a footprint of one of their gods in the rock. They say he walked this earth once. Did they throw deer hairs into the air? They tell their children this will bring new creatures into the world for them to hunt. (ALL LAUGHING) YEARDLEY: The Naturals must be taught that what they venerate is untrue and worthless. When their blasphemous totems are gone, they will forget them. What? Are we weak? Are we to be mocked by their vulgary? Destroy it. No, sir. Sir, they were worshipping. (RUSTLING) (GASPS) Tamlin. Why am I glad to see you? Tam... ..I will look after you this time. I promise. Tamlin... ..won't you come home with me? Please. (FLOOR CREAKING) (DOOR OPENS) (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) Governor, Opechancanough has changed his name to Mangopeesomon. That could be a war name. You should go and enquire, see what mood they live in. Do you tell me how to govern now, Sharrow? The Naturals are already defeated. Trade is a weapon that has tamed them. God, food and friendship will bring them to heel. They kneel in our churches, they wear our clothes, they crave our food and fineries. That is a people crushed. Governor, the Pamunkey are a brave, proud nation. If you believe them trampled under foot, then your mind is diseased with arrogancy. (CHUCKLES) Widow, I told you to curtsey when we met. Is there reason such rosy conceit is restored to your cheeks? Dear Governor, I am merely taking such pleasure in the taste of barley sugars. They appeared in my house after dark. Oh, but how they fill my mouth with such a sweet taste of England. I wonder how they arrived here. (CHUCKLES) There he is. There's the lad. Didn't I know he would come back? (SIGHS) Oh... (STAMMERING) You're looking fine. I hear you are to leave us, Master Read. When we return from upriver. I sent word to England that I was willing to pass on my forge to... the man who paid me the best price for it. Jamestown is to enjoy such prosperity. Our fortunes will grow as the town and its farms expand beyond imagining. I have no argument with other people's plans, but they're not mine. I see a golden sorrow on every face. When will you leave? There's no reason to delay, now that my new smithy's here. I'll go tomorrow. James... Might I give you a memento? (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) You saved my life. I hope you never forget that. (BELL TOLLING) We have received reports of the unfortunate death of Master Crabtree. I bid his body be returned to us, so that we might offer him a dignified burial. (ALL GASPING) (INDISTINCT MURMURING) Why is it filled with pigs' tongues? They are the mark of a liar. (PEOPLE LAUGHING) Governor. Governor, you must witness this. What kind of jest is this? Oh, but, sir, you were the one that had me arrested, locked up. Here I am. Governor, attend what he has upon his finger. The King's signet. Kill me if you wish, Governor. It will not alter your plight. I have sent news to His Majesty of what I discovered here. A new Governor is on the ocean now. (JOCELYN LAUGHING) (CONTINUES LAUGHING) Release him. Now... Let me wash your face for you, so you can see how handsome you are. (CHUCKLES) No! Leave me be. (CRYING) What happened to you out there, child? (DOOR CLOSING) REDWICK: James Read! You are arrested for the sake of a crime. What we hear is that you're leaving the town suddenly, and the widow's valuable brooch has been stolen. PEPPER: Why would the Pamunkey want war now, Henry? I hope they don't, but we will be ready. We must place barrels such as these all about the place, Pepper. Winganuske would say if there were to be trouble. Well, people live by deep loyalties. It may be that her bond is not to me, but to her own kind. If the Naturals do come... ..we will show them we hold a fearsome might. (MEN SHOUTING) (SPEAKING ALGONQUIAN) (MEN SHOUTING) (WHIMPERING) (INDISTINCT CALLING AND WHOOPING) (HEART THUMPING) (MUFFLED SCREAMING) Maria. What is it? I do not know. Something is wrong. But...Pedro, I do not know. (SHOUTING) YEARDLEY: My people... ..we are here in Virginia on the most wondrous mission. Farms. Families. Fortune. We are the conquerors and the conjurors of a new world. And I know what we create here will be founded on our love of the old country. We will fill our fields with many, many great men, like Pedro. We have set in motion what is to be. And so my calling here... ..my service to you is done. I am standing down as your Governor. A new Head of Virginia is aboard a ship, crossing the ocean, to take up this proud office. What is certain... ..what is beyond doubting... ..is that our noble cause here is riding to triumph. So go to your farms, to your businesses... ..and thank the heavens that we are English. (CROWD MUTTERING) Your appearance suggests that you are the one being deposed, Marshall. I have just heard who is to be our new Governor. Sir Francis Wyatt. Oh, but that's marvellous! My father served his father at Boxley Manor when I was a child. He's exceedingly fond of me. No tongue, sir? No voice? I do hope that you'll remain, Marshall Redwick. Together we might serve the new Governor. (WHISPERS) (DOOR CLOSING) I love you. There, I've said it. Now you will remain in Jamestown. No, I won't. We will marry. Now you'll stay. No. I will not. Do you not see? Yeardley is deposed. Fortune favours us at last. We can have land and whatever life we choose to make. You love me. I know you do. I have conceded. You have what you want. If I stay, I'll be your prisoner. Have you no notion of what it costs me to say these things? Every breath of my being is locked to a promise that I made myself. Never to love. Never love. Never. But I love you. I love you. Do you not hear it? I hear it. But you do not care. I care. Yes. But I'm leaving. Why? You'll know it when I'm gone. (SOFTLY) You break my heart. You break your own heart. (BANGING) (DOOR OPENS) James Read, we're searching for Chacrow. Have you seen him about? No, I've not, Silas. (SIGHS) James Read, I am in need of your fine wisdom. Will you help me? (CLEARS THROAT) (SNIFFS) I, uh... (SNIFFS) Tam. I can't take back what I said to you. And I can't undo what is done. There is sometimes about me... (STAMMERING) ..a bile... ..which is cruel and bitter. So... ..I thought, because my own pa... ..was hating and brutal... ..and because there's a storm that howls through me when I so much as sit still... ..I thought it was all justified. I see now it ain't never justified. I ain't a child. I'm a man. These words were given to me by James Read... ..but they're mine now. I'm a man, and you are the child. So I must behave as such. Will you have some bread? My wife, she makes... powerful bread. If you care for a pa... ..then I'd be proud. (TAM SOBBING) Powerful bread. (CHUCKLES) Fine work, captain. These men will serve me well. Have them taken to my farm today. Many men like Pedro will till the fields. Because we are the ones he will leave in his will for his children. Nobody will stop him. He does not have the power of a governor, but everything is the same. And you see how more like us come now. Perhaps it has started already. (CLICKS TONGUE) What are we to do? (SIGHS) You know what you must do. Believe, Pedro. (SPEAKING KIMBUNDU) (SPEECH DROWNED OUT BY MUSIC) (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) (MAN CHANTING INDISTINCTLY) (OBJECT RATTLING) (SPEAKING ALGONQUIAN) (MAN CHANTING) (CONTINUES IN ALGONQUIAN) (CONTINUES IN ALGONQUIAN) Mercy, why did you come here? I am afraid of ships. I have such fears of the sea. I... I'd never been away from my own village. But I bit on my lip and said to myself... 'Ain't it romantic?' Oh, Mercy. I love you so. I know you do, ma'am. Ain't no-one loves as you do. (BELL RINGING) (LIVELY MUSIC PLAYING) (MUSIC CONTINUES) I thought you had left us. I did. I turned back. Will you come with me? How can I? I fought every day for my place here, and now I've made it... Well, would you come with me, anyway, if I told you that I loved you? I promise you - we will travel across this land and we will discover all that can be discovered. And if we find an unbearably beautiful field, then we will build our home and we will have children. Children? (CHUCKLES) Yes, children. Come with me. No. Yes. I'll need at least two or three weeks to settle things here. Now is the moment. If you delay, you'll twist my mind, and try and persuade me to stay here. (CHUCKLES) Will you toast with me to Mercy? (CROWD CHEERING) (WHOOPING CALL) (CALLING CONTINUES) SILAS: Chacrow. (SPEAKING ALGONQUIAN) The food here in Jamestown is good. The Governor must be very happy, eh? (LAUGHING) I wish we were eating all of this for nothing. Did I tell the story about how I met Maria, eh? All right, so, Maria... (LAUGHS) ..when she saw me, she said... (DISTORTED SPEECH) ..when I see you. (MOUTHING) (PAMUNKEY CALLING) Maria. (SCREAMING) (CALLING CONTINUES) (SCREAMING) (SCREAMS) (PAMUNKEY CALLING) (GASPING) Pedro, let's move. We must get away. Hey, I am Pedro. (MARIA WHIMPERS) (WHOOPING CALL) (SOFT WHOOPING CALL) (SPEAKING ALGONQUIAN) (WHOOPING CALL) (PAMUNKEY CALLING) Oh, Christopher... (GASPS) Go to the town - tell everyone there is an attack. I will hide him away. Go, Maria! Or you will not live. Silas! Hurry! You cannot stay here. Where will they attack? There are many warriors coming from far away and they will attack all along the river. Go to the town. Run as fast as you will to Jamestown. What will you do, Chacrow? I love my people. Go. (CHACROW CRYING) WINGANUSKE: Henry. Henry. You are my family now, Henry. Winganuske, I will make you a good husband. Stay close to me. (HORSE NEIGHS) Master Crabtree, we're under attack from the Pamunkey. They're all about us. We need to get back to the settlement. Get the doctor aboard my wagon. (GROANS) Quickly. (PAMUNKEY CALLING) (SHRIEKS LOUDLY) (GASPS) Henry, there's more of them behind us. (ARROWS FLYING) We're trapped here. (PAMUNKEY CALLING) These people know me as a conjuror. You said as much yourself, Master Sharrow. Can you, between you, carry the doctor and move at speed down to the river? (ARROWS FLYING) I'll walk towards them as the sorcerer who mystifies them. As I have their full attention, you must move swiftly. Sir, they will kill you. Call to them. Tell them the conjuror comes to put them under his spell. (SPEAKING ALGONQUIAN) (CHANTING) (CHANTING LOUDLY) (PAMUNKEY MAN SHOUTS IN ALGONQUIAN) (PAMUNKEY CALLING) Pamunkey attack! James Read, Mistress Castell, get beyond the settlement. Pamunkey attack! Pamunkey attack! (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) Pamunkey attack! Everyone get into the settlement! Someone bring the Governor! (CLAMOURING) (SCREAMING) Close the gate! Pamunkey attack! (SPEAKING ALGONQUIAN) (YELLS IN ALGONQUIAN) (WHOOPS LOUDLY) (PAMUNKEY CALLING)
