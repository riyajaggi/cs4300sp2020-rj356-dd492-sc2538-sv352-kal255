He probably won't even recognize me. - Are we still going there? - Yeah, obviously. We should lie low for a bit.

 Isn't your dad's off-grid? - Why are you so obsessed with my dad? - What? I'm not. He's miles away. We need to find somewhere nearby. Somewhere nice. Could be like a mini break. Holy shit. - How do you know? - Know what? That this one's safe. No obvious burglar alarm. Dust everywhere, so no cleaner to worry about. Post. At least a week's worth. Is breaking and entering the best way of lying low? Cool. - Think that's him. - Who? The guy that lives here. Yeah, obviously. Bit uptight, isn't he? He's a professor. Whatever, it's fucking weird having a photo of yourself. Hey. Look what I found. Alyssa didn't have much respect for people. Or people's stuff. I sometimes wonder if I should just become an alcoholic. It means you've always got something to do. I reckon this'll do. Yeah. We can just chill here, plan our route, take our time. Yep. I'm trying to think what adults do in situations like this. Should we go downstairs and have a glass of wine? Yeah. OK. Are you hungry? Always. Well, that wasn't as shit as I expected.

Whoever says all boys are obsessed with sex hasn't met James. I really hope I'm not bad at this. Huh. Is this OK? Um, stop.

There is a word for girls like you. I'll bet. She is a fucking prick-tease bitch. Right, yeah. I'll tell her. Alyssa? Go away.
