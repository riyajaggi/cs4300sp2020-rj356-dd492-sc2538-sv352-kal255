 A lot of the time, you don't register important moments in your life as they happen. You only see that they were important when you look back. Fuck seat belts. What should we do? We need to find somewhere nearby. Somewhere nice. Holy shit! Is breaking and entering the best way of lying low? Do you think that's him? The guy that lives here? We can just chill here, take our time. Sometimes James feels like a boy I could love.

 Like, really love. Being with Alyssa had started to make me feel things. How did you get in here? Please don't. MUSIC: The Snare by Graham Coxon He was gonna hurt you, Alyssa. Fucking drive! I killed him. She didn't do anything. Tell them that I did it all, then you'll be OK. Armed police! James! GUNSHOT MUSIC: How Glad I Am by Nancy Wilson # My love has no beginning My love has no end # No front or back And my love won't bend # I'm in the middle

 # Lost in a spin... # CAR DOOR SHUTS # Loving you... # DOOR OPENS AND CHIMES # And you don't know, you don't know You don't know, you don't know... # HE CHUCKLES Bonnie! It is you! It's Ray. From St Joseph's. We were in the same class. I had, like, a medical eye-patch for a bit. Oh, yeah. SCANNER BEEPS And one of those. SCANNER BEEPS So how are you? You got kids? No. Married? No. So what have you been doing? Prison. Oh, right. Why were you, er...? What did...? What did you do? I killed someone. HE GULPS On purpose. Right. HE LAUGHS Shit! THEY LAUGH Properly got me there. HE LAUGHS You got me. You always had a weird sense of humour. Yeah. I'm gonna go kill someone else now. Do you want a bag? No, thanks. Bye, Ray. # And you don't know, you don't know You don't know, you don't know # How glad I am. # I learnt about punishment from a young age. I learnt it happens because of love. Austria. Vienna. China. Beijing. Democratic Republic of the Congo. Kinshasa. Latvia. Latvia. Kiev? I feel like you've punched me in the face. My mum always wanted me to go to university. MUSIC: My Special Angel by Bobby Vinton She couldn't go because she got pregnant. With me. She always put me first. Cod? Again? It's good for the synapses. Dad spent a lot of time in the garden. When I was 17, he lost his job. He didn't wanna tell us, so every day he got in the car and drove around until it was time to come home. When Mum found out, she was quite upset. # You are my special angel # Right from paradise... # Dad left soon after that. I'm... ..just getting some milk. # Heaven is in your eyes... # Mum said we were better off without him. MUFFLED SOBBING Mum? It meant she could focus all her energy on me. Where did you get this? I found it. Do you know what kind of women wear this? Hookers. Hookers don't pass exams. Eat it. What? Eat... ..it. All of it. Life can be hard. Make sure you chew. Mum taught me how to cope with it. Fucking weirdo. How to cope with people. BELL RINGS I'm gonna have to suspend you. OK. Can I keep that? No. When I was 18, I failed all my exams. Mum was actually OK about it. Three As. Good. And it didn't stop me from going to university. Thanks. I got a job there. Are you a student here, as well? Sometimes a small decision can lead to something big. Yes. Cool. Something really big. MUSIC: The Old Man's Back Again by Scott Walker # I seen a hand # I seen a vision # It was reaching through the clouds # To risk a dream # A shadow across the sky # And it crushed it to the ground # Just like a beast... # NECK CRACKS # The old man's back again # The old man's back again. # HE SCOFFS Er, may I? HE SIGHS This is your textbook for the term. HE CLICKS HIS FINGERS Don't move. Let's begin. Foucault is an embarrassment. He has no class. THEY LAUGH "Freedom is what you do with what's been done to you." Sartre. Be the protagonist in your own story. And that story begins with an act of intellectual defiance. Read Max Weber, Erving Goffman. Or if you want a more contemporary perspective, this guy's pretty good. You're not a student, are you? You just work here. People have earned the right to come to my class. You haven't. I don't want to see you again. OK? Sometimes people don't see your potential. So you have to show them. Was this you? Is this human... QUIETLY: ..shit? Yeah. Yours? Maybe. HE LAUGHS You can come to my class. On one condition. What? You have a drink with me. Once a week. OK. MUSIC: Wondrous Place by The Last Shadow Puppets Finally I could see a future for myself. And it felt good. # I found a place full of charms # A magic world in my baby's arms... # Go ahead. # Her soft embrace like satin and lace # A wondrous place. # DOOR SLAMS MUSIC: Above Suspicion by Mel Tillis and Sue York HE SIGHS # We're above suspicion # Both you and I # They say that I'm a good girl... # Take a seat. # And I'm a good guy... # Do you like this? Not really. So... ..tell me about yourself. No. OK. Why did you want to take my class? I was interested. In what? In what the point is. Of anything. Why aren't you a student? You're clearly bright. Failed my exams. Ah. Exams rank different levels of mediocrity, that's all. Exceptional people don't do well at them. I didn't. You are very pretty. THEY LAUGH Do you know that? Do people tell you that? You're a little salmon. Aren't you? What? You want to swim against the tide. Shall we take our clothes off? Take a taxi. Thank you. Do you know something? What? I could fall in love with you. MUSIC: He's A Keeper Of The Fire by Buffy Sainte-Marie # He's as heavy as a lead weight, baby # He's as skinny as a wire... # Has it happened yet? What? The love? Nearly. But, er, we're finished for tonight. # He's got a heavy kind of hoodoo, baby # And he can lay it on you # Ohhh, he can say it like... # MUSIC STOPS # I gave you my heart # Long, long ago # I can't take it back # Darling... # HE SIGHS # And though you treat me mean... # Just, er, returning these and, um, getting this one out. SCANNER BEEPS This is really good. Yeah. It's my favourite. Yeah. So do you speak German, then? Yeah. Oh, cool! HE SPEAKS GERMAN HE CLEARS HIS THROAT OK. Great. Thanks. SHE CLEARS HER THROAT Who was that? He wants to be my boyfriend. He asked me to a fondue night tomorrow. Are you going to go? I like cheese. WHISPERS: I'd like to take some photographs of you. What? WHISPERS: Come and see me tomorrow night. How about tonight? I can't do tonight. When you want something, it's hard to wait. CAR DOOR OPENS AND SHUTS You can get impatient. 00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:19,040 GLASS SMASHES AND CAR ALARM BLARES Who is she? Oh, I didn't want to worry you. What? I'd only seen her in lectures. I didn't know her name till she came to see me a couple of weeks ago. I was stupid... ..agreeing to talk to her alone. She said she was worried about her exams. I believed her. She's clearly in love with me. And now she's...made up these lies. She's threatening me. She's gonna say I attacked her. She wants to destroy me - my life, my work, everything. The girl's mad. So it isn't true? How can you ask me that? No, look, I... No, I didn't... Get out! GET OUT! Love makes you feel quite clear about what is right and what is wrong. And when someone has done something wrong, they have to get punished. # Go # Down the road # With me # Walking out of what I'm here for # Getting out of my head # Making plans for a better # Beginning... # ENGINE ROARS TYRES SCREECH AND GLASS SMASHES GLASS CRUNCHES PHONE KEYPAD BEEPS Ambulance. There's been an accident. ACOUSTIC GUITAR PLAYS # There's a long # Road... # You asked me to tell you about myself that time. And I said no. I want to tell you now. I learnt about punishment from a young age. I learnt it happens because of love. # Fly away I used feel like I maybe wasn't real. Like I was made up of nothing. But when you fall in love, the nothing feeling is eaten by a something feeling, which is eaten by an everything feeling. You swallowed me. And set me free. How do you know this one's safe? No obvious burglar alarm. Dust everywhere, so no cleaner to worry about. Post. At least a week's worth. Is breaking and entering the best way of lying low? # Fly away... # What? SHE SCREAMS MUSIC: How Glad I Am by Nancy Wilson # My love has no beginning My love has no end # No front or back And my love won't bend # I'm in the middle # Lost in a spin # Loving you # And you don't know, you don't know You don't know, you don't know... # Hi. Is Alyssa in? # My love has no bottom My love has no top # My love won't rise And my love won't drop # I'm in the middle # And I can't stop # Loving you. #
