  Things didn't always go entirely to plan on my journey with Alyssa. Do you think it's gonna explode? It's not a film. If this was a film, we'd probably be American. Whoo! Yeah! I kept wondering what sort of sound she'd make when I killed her. I needed to find somewhere quiet. Guess what freedom smells like? -What? -Cow shit. -Seat belt. -Fuck seat belts.

 So what do you wanna do? I dunno. Because we can literally do anything, James. Anything we want. Gun! Gun! Gun! Ironically, I was not in my element. Come on! This is shit! Sometimes, I look at him and I think, "Are you a bit dead?" Put your tongue in my ear. -What? -I like it. Right, stop that now. Sorry. Alyssa was really good at annoying people.

 Thank God I smashed my phone. I bet my mum's been calling nonstop. Stupid bitch. How long till your dad calls the police? What? About the car. He won't. -Really? -Yeah. He'll think I'm coming home soon. And he's a prick and everything, but he's pretty optimistic. What? What? I like food. OK. My mum says that if food were her boyfriend, she'd be in an abusive relationship. She says it like it's a joke, but it's not. What? Did you bring money with you? Didn't you? Yeah. I just spent it at Laserkill. That was all your money. I didn't have to pay for you. I was being fucking polite, actually. What are we going to do? Well, it's just food. And we haven't eaten all of it. You haven't. The only rule with these things is that you never steal from a small or independent business. -Whose rule is that? -My dad's. He's basically Robin Hood. He breaks the law, but he's really moral. "If it's a chain, it's free rein." -Say it. -"If it's a chain, it's free rein." There you go. Otherwise, you're basically funding terrorism. -Places like this are all run by the Man. -What man? "The Man" man. The Man who, you know, owns all the oil, forces Chinese children to make smartphones and hates Palestine. Are you gonna be a pussy? Showing willing was the best approach with Alyssa. No. Shit. Nice one. -Seat belt! -Fuck seat belts. I had her right where I wanted her. We should have sex. -What, now? -Yeah. Take your top off. Erm, OK... I had to go along with it. Should... -Should we stop? -No. Keep driving. But I wasn't sure sex was something you could just go along with, especially not as a man. It's OK for women. They can just lie back, think of England. Us men, we have to be England. Stop! I think I'm stuck. Shit. Why are you laughing? My dad loves this car. It's the most expensive thing he's ever bought. What the fuck are we gonna do now? Do you think it's gonna explode? It's not a film. Come on. -Where are you going? -Well, we can't drive it, can we? I might be able to fix it. We can't just leave it. Do you reckon you can still fix it? What should we do? Go home. Do you wanna go home? Hang on. Does he want to go home? You saying you wanna go home? 'Cause that's fine, can if you want. -No, I don't want to. I was just asking... -I don't wanna go home, James. -But... -I don't want to go home. -So what do you want to do? -I don't know! Why don't you fucking think of something for once? I couldn't have done it there.

I can't believe he got in the front. Grab us that sweater in the back, there, love. Chuck it down to your boyfriend. Who said he's my boyfriend? Alyssa was starting to test my patience. Are you all right, love? Is she all right, son? She's fine. You're funny, you. I like you. -That your dog? -Nearly, I'm buying her. -She's cute, though, ain't she? -Yeah. Not for long, mind.

So it's a bit different from being dead, isn't it? This guy's a prick. What? He's, like, the worst kind of person. He's all right. Why are you defending him?

It's part of the job, son. How many? Well, be a bit sick to keep count, wouldn't it? I'd have definitely kept count. -I'm gonna go to the... -Oh, yeah, sure. -toilet. -Sure, sure. I say, son. I might as well join you. Put one in the bag, you know. I'm bad at apologizing to people, but sometimes I know I should. What happened to your hand? Sometimes, I just... let things happen. Even though I didn't want them to. I'm not sure why. What's going on? Are you gay? No. -It's OK if you are. -I'm not. -But you should tell me if you are. -I'm not gay. So what are you doing? Where do you think you're going? Well, I... gotta go. The dog's not gonna collect herself, now is she? Gimme your wallet. You what? Give me your wallet. No. No... Give me your wallet or I swear to fuck I'll go visit Liz and Abi and your weird potato baby, and tell them what you like to do with teenage boys in toilets. You wouldn't do that. I'll tell the police, too. He put my hand there. You know that if people wanna do stuff to you, you don't have to let them. Yeah. Do you? Yeah. So why did you? Did something bad happen to you when you were small? No. I'm tired. -A double room? -Yup. A double room with a double bed for double sex. I really need to cry. -Do you wanna watch TV? -OK.
