 [rumbling]
 [ominous chords]
 [Phil] How are you feeling? Better?
 Good.
 What're you two doing today, then?
 Can we go feed the ducks?
 -Ah, ducks! Sounds good. -No, James. I said,
 [Vanessa] not today.
 Come on. You can manage ducks, can't you?
 [Phil] Be good for you to get out.
 [James] Please?
 [clock ticks]
 OK.
 Ducks.
 [ominous music]
 [brakes creak]
 Hey, I want to tell you something.
 [silence]
 I love you.
 [ducks quack]
 I need to feed them.
 [door slams]
 [excited quacking]
 [rumbling]
 [rumbling intensifies]

 [rumbling]
 [clang]
 [bang]
 [muffled] Thanks for coming in, son.
 Son?
 Hello?
 [clock ticks ominously]
 Yeah?
 Sorry about the wait.
 I'm DC Onslow.
 They, um...
 They told me you've, uh...
 you've come in to report a murder, is that right?
 [James] In the cold light of day, that suddenly didn't seem right at all.
 Uh-huh.
 OK, so, um...
 -I'm gonna need you to come with me. -It was my mum.
 -Yeah, you just need to wait. -She killed herself.
 Right.
 OK.
 Um...
 So, um, do you want to tell me what...
 what happened? Did you find the body? Your mum?
 I was there when she did it.
 Right.
 Well, um...
 And so, when did this...
 when did this happen?
 -Last night? -11 years ago.
 [clock ticks]
 OK.
 Um...
 So, here's the thing. Um...
 It's not technically a murder.
 Suicide, it's a whole, different wheelhouse, really, um.
 I mean, suicide's not even a crime...
 [uncomfortable laugh] ...which is...
 mad, innit?
 Do you want to speak to a woman?
 Why would I want to speak to a woman?
 Well, you know, because, you know...
 No.
 What about your dad?
 Have you got a dad?
 No, not really.
 Can we come in?
 God, is it James?
 Is he dead?
 Your son stole your car...
 then crashed it into a tree and set fire to it.
 [Teri] It was found last night.
 Has he ever done anything like that before?
 Why didn't you say anything about the car when you reported him missing?
 Well, I didn't want him to get into trouble.
 He's a weird kid, but he's not bad.
 [Teri] Uh, who did that to you?
 I just got into a fight.
 At the pub.
 Did James do it?
 No.
 [Eunice] Is his mum around?
 No.
 [Teri] Is she at work?
 She's dead.
 Sorry.
 Really sorry.
 Does anyone want a cup of tea?
 [Phil] Kettle's on.
 Did you find his girlfriend, then?
 -Who's his girlfriend? -She's called Alyssa.
 [rock music]
 [Alyssa] It was the right thing, to leave James...
 [deep rumble]
 I didn't kill anyone.
 It's better if I go to my dad's on my own, anyway.
 I wish I hadn't left James with the money, though.
 Oh, God.
 I'd really like it if this was
 some horrendous, murder-inspired fantasy moment.
 But no.
 [music stops]
 What's she done?
 [baby gurgles]
 Is she OK?
 When did you last see Alyssa?
 [Tony] On Saturday.
 We were having a party, and she ran away.
 Why?
 Didn't like handing out the canapés.
 What time did she leave?
 [Tony] It was around...
 I'm sorry. Could you let your wife answer, please?
 Sure.
 I mean, it's not my daughter, not my problem.
 [baby gurgles] [rattle shakes]
 [Eunice] Do you know where she is now? Has she rung at all?
 I don't know where she is.
 [Gwen] Look, what is this about?
 We need to talk to your daughter in connection with a murder.
 Oh, my God.
 -She's not a suspect. -Not at the moment.
 [Gwen] Jesus Christ!
 She's a potential witness.
 [Teri] Didn't you think to report her as missing?
 Her boyfriend's dad reported him immediately.
 She doesn't have a boyfriend.
 [Eunice] We're going to need a recent photograph of Alyssa. Um...
 Do you have one?
 [defensive] I've got some upstairs.
 [baby gurgles]
 [whispers] I can recommend Childline or the NSPCC.
 [DC Onslow] OK, will do.
 Thanks.
 [beep] [door opens]
 So, I've been speaking to my DI, that was him on the phone there.
 What we thought would be the best thing is if we put you
 in touch with social services.
 And they can take things from here. What do you think?
 Unless you've got someone else who can look after you?
 [indie music]
 OK, so that's what I'm going to do, then.
 So...
 [DC Onslow] So, I'm gonna need a few details from you, young man.
 [clang]
 So, first up... This is typical.
 Who do you have to fuck around here to get a pen that works?
 Here we go.
 Uh, full name.
 [music fades]
 Oh, shit.

 [music stops]
 What've you got in there?
 Hmm?
 [Eunice] No wonder she ran away. Poor kid.
 Let's just wait and see.
 Are you sure?
 I'm on a fast day.
 Thought you were tense.
 [foreboding music]
 Can I say something?
 Yeah.
 I think we should clear the air.
 Wait, just hear me out.
 Uh, I think it's more professional.
 Look...
 people get drunk and...
 stuff happens in the night that maybe wouldn't happen in the day.
 And just because that comes as a surprise,
 it doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad thing.
 I can see you regret it.
 [Teri] I don't regret it.
 I just wish it hadn't happened.
 [melancholy music]
 -Alyssa. -I don't want to hold your hand.
 [dog barks]
 [door closes heavily]
 [loaded silence]
 Did you take anything else?
 Arms out.
 -What? -Arms out.
 -Don't fucking touch me. -Do you want me to call the police?
 All right.
 How did you get that?
 Are you going to look at me?
 Hmm?
 [Emil sighs]
 -I don't want to have sex with you. -Wait, what?
 I don't want to, even if you pay me.
 I don't want to have sex with you!
 I have sex with my wife.
 [Emil sighs]
 [Alyssa] Shit.
 What's going to happen to me?
 I'm going to file a report. And then I'm going to call the police.
 -Police? -Yes.
 You're a thief.
 [Alyssa] Not the police.
 [radio] Emil? A bloke's lost his kid.
 Little girl? Five years old?
 I'm just handling something, can you deal with it?
 [radio] It's the end of my shift.
 All right, I'm coming.
 Stay here.
 Fucking idiot.
 [upbeat music]
 [man] She is five, but she's really tiny,
 and she's got brown hair down to about here.
 No, I was just...
 [music gets louder]
 ...gray leggings and a...
 -Daddy! -Oh, where have you been?
 [man] Thank you.
 Thank you. Thank you so much!
 [man] Don't do that again.
 [music stops]
 [James] I knew she was probably long gone...
 but it seemed important to try.
 [melancholy music]
 [Alyssa] James would be shitting himself right now.
 I wonder what he's doing.
 [music fades]
 Are you OK?
 Yeah, I'm fine.
 Got a boyfriend?
 Did he hurt you?
 Did he do that?
 No, someone else.
 [screech]
 Go on, get out of here.
 Really?
 Yeah.
 What about the pants?
 Thanks.
 -Thanks. -Stop stealing.

 I lost the money.
 I didn't come back for the money.
 I'm sorry I left you.
 I'm sorry I killed him.
 I won't leave you again.
 OK.
 Should we go to my dad's?
 OK.
