 Oh, my god.  Wow. Christina, I love you.  This is amazing. Thank you so much.  You're welcome. and so far, I'm loving the ride. hey. Hey! What's going on? How are you? Good. How about yourself?  Good. All right. So I started laying out  some materials for that flip in anaheim. Ooh. Yeah, it's pretty cool. Loving these cabinets. Izzy asked me to meet him  over at his shop to look at materials for a flip, and also, he has a lead  for a potential new client. Very mid-century. You're so stylish nowadays. That's beautiful, really nice. All right. Done. So while you're here, I want  to throw something out at you. I've been working out,  and I met this amazing gal. Her name is liz, and she's talking about needing  a kitchen remodel. The kitchen  is not functional. It's super dated,  and she's a single mom. She has three boys,  always bumping into each other, and she just took  her bar exam. Wow. She sounds pretty amazing, and she wants a new kitchen? She deserves  a new kitchen. Yeah, she does. I love, like, a kick-ass mom  who wants to make a change. I'm actually wrapping up a project right now, and I would love  to start a new one, so it sounds  pretty perfect. I'm glad you can help. Next week, I can go  check it out. Fantastic.  She's gonna be so excited. Cool. I can't wait to meet her. Thanks for thinking of me.  Awesome. You're looking so fit. Yeah! Thank you for noticing. All right. Have a good one.  Bye. hi.  Hi, welcome. So nice to meet you. Finally, I get to meet you. Come inside. Boys, come downstairs! Hi, guys.  Say hello. - Hello!  -Hi.  -Hi. I wanted you to meet her  before you... I'm austin. Nice to meet you. Hi. What's your name?  Conner. Hi. Tyler.  Tyler? So how old are you guys? I'm 10. He's 11, and he's 13. Wow. You are tall. Oh, my gosh.  Everyone says that. you ready to get  a new kitchen? Yes. Yeah. Yes. Don't worry.  Teamwork. Teamwork  makes the dream work. That's what  I always say. You're so cute. Okay. You guys ready?  Let's go. Nice meeting you guys. Someone is picking up  you guys up today. Bye, boys. Have a wonderful day! You got  your hands full. Yes. I love it. So I really love what you  have going on here. It has a very, like,  nice beachy vibe. I love the beach vibe. It's cool.  It's breezy. So I'm kind of getting a sense  for your style. Kitchen? So the kitchen has a '70s vibe  that just never got updated. It's falling apart. The oven doesn't work, so I got to use this little toaster oven, which I can't even  cook most meals because look  how tiny it is. So definitely need to work  on that. I know you like  the beachy vibe. We're near the beach, so is that something you want to see in here  as well? Absolutely. Okay. You know, cool colors,  blues, the grays. And how much are you looking to spend here? About $42,000. We can definitely  make that work. Can we? Yes. Okay, good. Let's talk layout. Right away, I notice that  the refrigerator is opening into a wall,  so what I'm thinking is that, because you have these  small appliances on display, we create a cabinet  where we can put those away. We'll shift  the refrigerator over, and we can do an oven  right here with a range top, and then we'll continue  the countertop, but instead of doing  a peninsula, we can do an island. And we can have space  for you guys to all eat and -- They can walk around. Exactly.  Oh, I love it. And once everything is demoed,  I'll give you a design plan so that we can incorporate  this living area so it feels like  one cohesive space. So I know izzy is super excited  to get started as well. He told me that you guys met  at a local gym. Yes, we met working out, and I'm excited for him  to start, too. I'll call him when I leave, and we can get started this week. Okay.  Let's do it. so liz and her kids moved in  with her mom, and I can tell  she's a little bit stressed. She's sleeping on the couch. Anyone going through a remodel  for the first time, it's like, "what is going on here?" hey!  Ah! Hey! Oh, my gosh. How are you? I'm doing good. I'm doing good. I haven't seen you  working out lately. Oh,  you've been slacking? I mean, I do,  like, you know... I can do wall-sits  all day long, too. What do you got? Just like this. No big deal. That's amazing. All day. I mean, literally all day. Look!  They're shaking! Oh, no!  Oh, my god! Okay. We're not gonna do  this exercise ever again. Oh, my god!  My thighs are burning here. That's pathetic. That was, like, a minute.  It was a minute. No, it had to be longer  than a minute. I doubt it. Next time I see you guys, it's  gonna go bad for you guys. It's gonna down,  right? Just be ready, okay? After that performance, I'm not scared at all. Walk away right now.  Walk away. Hi.  How are you? Good.  How are you? Great.  Welcome. Hi. Christina. Nice to meet you. Finding a new home  has been way harder than I thought it would be back  when my house sold. Come on in  and enjoy it. If you have any questions  at the end, let me know. Okay.  Thank you. We've been in the rental  for way too long. I need to get the kids settled  and into a permanent home, so I'm spending every weekend  looking at houses. So pretty. Look how high the ceilings are. Wow, this is a big room.  It's beautiful. Oh, my gosh.  Look at that giant island. Check out the yard,  the most important part. These doors are really nice. Look how they open  to that backyard. Is there a pool? I wonder if there's room  to add one. What do you think? It's a little bit small. Want to go look at the rooms? So is this the master, or it would be a guest room  'cause it's pretty big? That's what I think. Yeah, let's go up there. All right.  Let's go upstairs. I call dibs on this room! You call dibs on this room?  Sorry, sweetie. This is the master. This is, like, one of  the biggest master bedrooms I've ever seen. And they really wanted  to get this cool tub in, but it sacrificed, like, space. What's down here?  There's another room. What is this? Wait.  I'm confused. Is there another staircase? Brayden.  No, no. Don't do that, honey.  Come on. That's weird, mom. If this was your room,  you would have to walk through my room  every single day. Yay!  Oh, no. Not yay.  Not yay. the house is beautiful,  but the layout is a bit too funky  to work for me and the kids, so have to keep on looking. Is this  your first time seeing it? I have  not been here... Well, I'll let  you go first. ...Since day one. It's been almost 2 weeks  since liz was last here, and I can't wait to show her  how far we've come. Oh, my god.  Everything is gone. Fresh start. Oh, I love this! So, now we have an island, and just look at how much better the flow is. And the boys  can walk around. This is awesome. So how are you? I am good. I'm -- living at my mom's is kind of -- three boys. You're a trooper. Oh, I love this,  though. So I know you got a lot  going on, but I've brought some materials  to start designing. Okay.  Okay, want to help me  grab them? This is  the exciting part. It is. I'm not peeking. Don't peek. Not looking. Whoa. Got a lot of stuff. Okay, so first things first, I know that it wasn't in the budget to replace all the flooring, and so we are leaving  this flooring throughout the rest  of the house. Yes, yes.  All right. So the first option... Oh, my gosh. ...Is this  beautiful laminate. I love this, and it's durable  for the boys? Yes!  Okay. Trust me. I picked everything  to be durable. I totally get it.  Awesome. So this is cabinets. This is a driftwood,  which, again I think really  has a beachy feel, and by being a flat panel,  it's more modern. Here's a countertop. Oh, wow. This is quartz, and it is the easiest maintenance, cleans right up. Perfect. So I...  It's like christmas. Like, you're bringing  all these fun things out. So I chose backsplash options,  very beachy, very kind of  mermaid tail. Yes. That one, and then will it go  with the cabinet? Do you like that cabinet, or you're not feeling it? I don't know.  I really don't know. the cabinets, I can tell you're a little bit unsure. It's too dark for me,  I think. I want you to love it. I want you to love the whole kitchen, so I have a suggestion. Another option could be this darker driftwood actually comes in a white. Oh, I love that. But at the same time, I feel like if we do all white, it's gonna look  a bit washed out, so my idea would be to do the darker driftwood for the island only. This is gonna look like a custom piece of furniture. I like that. Then you'll have  the white cabinet with the white countertops  and the backsplash. It's really gonna pop, and I think that's going to look really unique, and it's really gonna have that beachy feel. Okay. Oh, I do like that.  Okay. I will get it ordered, and next time that we both see this kitchen, the cabinets will be getting installed. This is exciting. Oh, my gosh. How was your day? Yeah, really good. Oh, glass of wine. Oh, thank you. Yeah? What the heck happened  to this thing? Yeah, I did have a go. Did you attempt  to open this? Then I gave up and stuck  it back in the fridge. you know you're gonna  mess it up even more. My landlord phoned me up. Yeah?  My lease is up. Can you believe  it's been a year? No, it's crazy. right.  Let me have another try. I did try month-to-month,  but he wants to rent a year. If you think --  this is awful. But if you think  about it, either I take a lease out  and extend for another year, or we should just stop  floating between two houses and just stay in one. oh, yeah, it's gone in now. I know what I want. I want to live with you. Makes sense to me. I would love it. And we can start looking  at a different house. Wow. This is a big step,  but I'm so ready for it, and some people might think  it's a little quick, but when you know, you know. We're buying a house together,  and it's so perfect, and I just can't wait  to start our lives together. It feels really good. It's really exciting.  Yep. Sushi, celebrate? Yep. hi. Hey. Ah. Wow. This is amazing. I cannot believe this. I'm so glad  we did the two-tone. What do you think?  I love it. It kind of adds, like, the beach element that you love. This color is gonna look  so pretty when we put  those light laminate floors in. I can't wait. hi.  Hey, ladies. Oh, my god, the floor. Wow. Do you love the floors? I cannot believe it.  I love it. There it is.  Absolutely love it. There it is. But I've been thinking  about something, and I'm a little bit  concerned. Oh, my god, the floor. Do you love the floors? I cannot believe it.  I love it. Look at how beautiful  that is. But I had some thoughts  about the rest of the house. I'm a little bit concerned. Come with me to the other  room, please. Okay.  Okay. Great. Thanks, izzy. Okay. So what are you thinking? Well, I love the flooring  in the kitchen, and I love the way  it matches the tile, but I'm wondering your thoughts on putting that floor  throughout the house to make it a cohesive look. I 100% am all for putting  this same flooring throughout. Okay.  Okay. But I think it's gonna cost  about $3,000 to demo it  and put the new floors in. $3,000. Okay. It's a hard decision to make. I honestly don't know  what to do. Big changes make me nervous,  so if I seem unsure, it's just because I'm afraid  of making a bad decision. I feel like it's -- you know,  a lot of times people are, with like a spouse  and or something -- I feel -- you know, it's like she doesn't  really have anyone else to bump the ideas off of,  so, you know, I'm here to make  her feel comfortable and confident in her choices and help her making  these decisions. In my experience,  if it's something that you're thinking about doing  while you are out of the house, now is the time. I think you're right.  Okay. Let's do it.  Don't be nervous. It's all good.  I am nervous. I am nervous.  You got this. if we could get a house  anywhere in the world and money was no object,  where would you want one? Ugh, I kind of  like california. Yeah!  Ah! Whoa.  Hello. Cheers to a day off. Is that what we're celebrating?  Yes. That's how rare  days off are. Few and far between. Okay, so this is one of  my favorite things to do. What?  Look at houses? Window shop on the water. Look how cute  that house is. Clean, crisp, big windows,  oh, my gosh. You love a white house,  don't you? I do. Yeah, but what's the cost of houses down here? Say, for example,  one of these. $10, $12 million. I mean, obviously out  of the price range, okay? The market is crazy. Round here, it's crazy. But there's not that much  on the market, and the stuff  that's on the market, if it's good,  it goes quick. How's work going? Work is going really good. You know, I just started  on liz's house, but she's super indecisive, so she doesn't really, you know, see the vision quite yet,  but it's going really good. I have every single faith  in you. It's all gonna be fine... Yeah.  ...Probably. oh, my god.  It's beautiful. Look at it. The kitchen is gonna  look amazing, but the living area  is just kind of bland now. It really needs something bold, and since liz is maxed out  on her budget, what do I do? Watch this. I'm thinking we do  an accent wall of wallpaper. Okay? The first one looks a lot  like the backsplash. Oh, yeah.  The next one is kind of  a more modern gray. I like gray. And the third one is like  a shimmery silver. I like that shimmer. It's gonna look like water  pouring down. Okay. Good.  I like that. Thank you. So for a wallpaper  and installation, what are we looking at? It's about $600. $600 more. I know you have spent  a lot of money here. Yes. So I have a way that you're not  gonna have to pay for it. For a wallpaper  and installation, what are we looking at? It's about $600. $600 more. So I have a way that you're not  gonna have to pay for it. I like that.  How? It involves me and izzy, okay. Wow. What's up? A challenge. A challenge, like,  a eating challenge? No, an exercise  competition. All right.  What you got? There's this place  in laguna beach called 1,000 steps. Oh, wow. And there are steps  that lead down to the ocean. Stairs?  Yes. Loser pays for the paper. Either way, you win. You get the wallpaper... Perfect.  Yes. ...Which is cool. Awesome. All right. All right. I'm a little bit nervous  'cause I don't know exactly what the workout is. Let's do it.  Let's do it. Okay.  Game on. But we won't tell her that. We won't tell her  that I'm nervous. dun, dun, dun! Scared? This is 1,000 steps. Those are not to code. Oh, code schmode. Let's go.  Come on. I've done competitions,  and this is not fair. - We'll start at the bottom. - Calves are crunching. You know, we did  this squat challenge... Look!  They're shaking! Oh, no!  Oh, my god! ...Which I smoked him on, so I'm definitely not afraid  to challenge him again. Whoever can do the most sets  in 15 minutes wins. We're gonna go up?  And we're gonna up  and down. All the way.  And that's one. You draw the line  in the sand. All right. On my mark.  Good job. Just the lighter I am,  the better. Okay.  Okay, izzy. Get set. Go! Go, guys!  Go! Wait. You can't be running up there. Oh, my gosh. No way. Come on, guys. Go! Ugh! Wait. Where are you going? Come on. Let's go.  Let's go. Come on, izzy. Go to the line. Hmm.  Did that count? I see you walking!  Go! You try doing this. Come on, izzy. He's, like,  talking himself up. Whew! You guys are doing great! Second wind, baby. You've got this,  like, strut going. Ugh!  How are you behind me? There's no way  that's possible. Ah! Nine, eight, seven, six...  Oh, awesome! Who won?  Who do you think? I lapped you. You feel okay? I'm happy...  Thank you. ...To give you your wallpaper.  Thank you. Oh, we still  have to go back up. Race to the top? I was hoping there was  an elevator. all right.  Right about here. Nice.  Heavy? A little bit. Nah, nah, not at all. I cannot wait to show  liz her kitchen. She totally deserves it, and I can't wait to see  the look on her face. My heart is beating,  so I'm nervous. I like that feeling. It means something exciting  is coming. Okay.  Okay. Come on in. Oh, my god. this is amazing. I am so glad we did all the floors. I love it.  Me too. It looks so cohesive. It looks so beautiful, and it looks so nice  with your furniture. I love it. Yes.  Absolutely. Wow.  This is amazing. Thank you. This isn't even  the main surprise. And if she loves this room  that much, I can't wait for her  to see the kitchen. Oh, my god. It doesn't even seem like this  is my house. Oh, my god. This is all yours. I'm envisioning what it used  to look like. and I can't believe  the transformation. I love it. You have all your appliances  in here now. We have so much  more storage. It's just so much  more functional. And I love that we did that.  The backsplash? I absolutely love that. It's so you.  It is. Beachy, cool, relaxed feel,  we got it. You can just totally envision the boys sitting right here and you doing your thing,  and there is room. And there's so much space. I love it.  I love the white. I'm so glad we went  with the white. And how do you feel about the wallpaper? I love it.  I mean, look at it. It's like a waterfall, and you can see the shimmer. And I like that, every time  you look at it, you're gonna be thinking  about me and izzy doing those stairs,  1,000 steps. thank you so much.  Sorry. I don't mean to cry,  but I have a beautiful kitchen. Her getting teary-eyed  and just loving this project just really means  so much to me. She's such an amazing person. Having christina and izzy  come in and just do this for me,  it's a gift. I am so excited to show  the kitchen to these boys. Open your eyes.  Dang! This is fancy! Wait. What? Open the island up. There you go.  What? Dang, that's fancy. What does this one do? It's just a lamp, boys. The kitchen feels amazing. I can't believe I'm cooking. I'm moving around. They're moving around,  and we have plenty of space. It's so nice working  with someone like liz, and it's wonderful that she  and her kids are gonna have a kitchen that they can enjoy  for years to come, and now that ant and I are  buying a home together, I'm really excited  about our future, too.
