 Touching Evil (1997â€“1999): Season 2, Episode 3 - War Relief: Part 1 - full transcript 
 Three men are found dead,each corpse has a hole in the head but has been carefully washed,perfumed and wrapped in a white shroud as if in a ritual burial. The common link is that they all served in the Bosnian war,working for a relief agency. CCTV cameras capture the identity of the possible murderer,Jim Keller,a man who was also in Bosnia but believed to be dead.

 Hey, come on, Jim. A joke's a joke. This is ridiculous. Talk to me, Joe. I don't know what to say. You said you don't remember. I lied, OK? I remember. I'll give you everything. You lied. Well, you don't forget something like that.

 You don't have to lie, Joe, not to me. I understand. OK, I'm sorry. I remember every thing. Jim, please listen to me. I don't have to take it anymore, Joe. I've come to bring you home. I'll take care of you. No! According to the detailed reports from Officers Creegan and Taylor, DC Rivers' shooting of the suspect David Laney was wholly in accordance with his duty. And therefore, we conclude that there are no grounds for further action.

 DC River stands completely exonerated and should be commended for saving the life of a fellow officer, namely DI Taylor. That's it. Do you have anything to add to this? Nothing, sir. That's the end of it then, at least officially. Congratulations. Thank you, sir. Rivers, you might want to consider the loyalty shown by your fellow officers. Ah, you still here then? Worse luck? Yeah, yeah, it is for us. Yeah, get some some drink or something. For what? The reports. I want a crate of the finest malt. What about you, Susan? Yeah, whatever. Well, I'm not much good at this sort of thing. What sort of thing? Saying thanks. You've got mine, Mark-- us against the world. What-- what more can I do? I don't know what to do. What does she want? Time. Creegan. Wow, I see why they called us. Not the safest way to dump a body, is it? He looks Scottish. I don't think so. His name is Joe Glenn. His wife's inside. Uh, there are doctors with her at the moment. So we'll have to wait for a statement. With a signature like that, I don't think this is the last one. Nor the first. Why? Oh, come on. This is too well-planned. He's done it before. Why Joe? He didn't have an enemy in all the world. Where did he work? Well, he doesn't-- didn't. He gave it up to do volunteer work overseas. Right. And why was that? You tell me. Nobody understood why he went out there to see those things. I mean, it was a war zone. Were you looking for me? Where's Mark? Door to door. You need to talk to him. I don't think I'm want to-- He needs you to come through for him. I did in the report. You know what I mean. Damn. What? Oh, Joseph Glenn had been working for a voluntary aid organization. I was hoping that might be a link. Hm, is that another one of your hunches? Mark's on the edge. Push him too far, and he'll walk. It's like you said. Bottom line, us against the world. I was bullshitting. I don't believe you. I can brighten your day, folks. I can brighten your day with a big issue. Thanks very much, first sell of the day. Delightful. All right, have a good day. See you later. Come on, folks, big issue, folks-- bigger issue, bigger issue. The bruising on Joe Glenn's wrist, it looks like he's been tied up. It's not the kind of thing you take lying down, is it? Susan, this is a 35-year-old healthy man. So how did he let himself get tied up in the first place? He knew him? And trusted him completely. Big issue, gents, big issue. Come on, folks, get the big issue. Hey. Jim, you bastard. Where'd you spring from? How'd you find me? Your father. You mean he actually admitted he knew me? How are you doing? Susan, Creegan was right. This isn't the first. Yeah? Interpol have got two similar cases on the record involving bodies wrapped in white sheets. It took me half the night to get. Set up a link to talk to the families of the victims. See what you can dig up. Now, it's case failed. Come. We need help. The name is Johan Valent. Can you me help? Looks like it's been hard for you, Eddie. I'll survive. You think that's enough, just surviving? I don't get you. You don't wish that things could be different. All the time Come up. Let's have a beer. Joseph Glenn, [inaudible] said he was killed by a drill to the head, then washed and found outside his house by his wife. This is Frieda Halt, killed in Zurich, again, washed and delivered to her home. Swiss police thought she was killed by an icepick. Johan Valent, a medical student, found dead in autumn-- again, similar MO. Three victims, one killer, and now we have a link. They all worked for voluntary aid organizations. Point of contact, Bosnia-- so there's a very good chance that they each other. Marion? The fact that the bodies have been washed is significant. It suggests consideration, even empathy. - What about a sheet? - Well-- It's a ritual. So he's preparing them for death. Or for the next life, wrapping them up like angels. So what are we looking for, a religious fanatic, a cult? Uh, I think we're looking at an individual. Or someone who was in Bosnia at the same time as the other three victims, but this list is huge. It could spread around the world. No, I don't think it's going to go that far. Now, you've got Zurich, Arnhem, London. So there's a feeling of direction. I think our killer's come home. Here, hold this. Oh, nice work. Yes. Hey, hey, Eddie, to me. And he scores. Go to the [inaudible]. Why is it off? Oh, one down. Jim? Jim? What's wrong? Are you OK? What are you doing? For God's sake, Jim, let me go. Let me go. Jim, let me go. I don't understand, Jim, please. Please. Please. Please. Susan, these are the names and addresses of volunteers that we should check out in the southeast. That'll keep you busy. Yeah. Knowing my luck, I'll be sharing a scone with grannies all day. Well, I'll split it with you. Cheers. I owe you one, again. Mrs. Keller? DI Taylor, OSC. I wonder if I could talk to you about your husband. My husband, he's dead. Yes? Hello, uh, Colonel Raymond Mackie. Can I help you? I, uh, DC Rivers, OSC. I'm surprised to find you, Mr. Mackie. You're down on my list as missing in action. Huh, what? Yeah, I actually only popped by on the chance of meeting someone who might have known you. Ah, yes. Well, I am-- I got a bit screwed up by my time in Bosnia. I sort of ran away from everyone. I'm trying to forget about it really. Yeah, I see. Well, can I help? Yeah, I need to ask you some questions. OK, come in. Great. Do you mind me asking how your husband died? Why do you want to know? Oh, we're investigating a case which involved some people your husband might have met overseas. How did he die? Well, they told me he had gone missing, missing presumed dead. I'm sorry. Is there a photograph I could see? Hm, there you are. So the message is be vigilant and careful but don't panic. If you see anyone or anything suspicious, then please call me. Here's my card. That's terrible news, just terrible. Yeah. Well, that's all for now. Thank you. Uh, oh, I'll need some proof of ID from you. What? Oh, yes, of course. Fine, that's it. I'll, uh, leave you to your chores. Uh, look, um, this is difficult, but you're not going to tell them I'm back, are you? Sorry? People will want explanations. Make me talk about my time out there. I'd rather remain here on my own. I'm no to anyone. Well, unless your name comes up again, you won't be hearing from me. Thank you. I mean it. No problem, Colonel Mackie. When was the body found? About an hour ago. You were the first one in here. Can you tell us what you found, Jude? I only came in to pick up today's copies. And it was-- he was just lying there. Yeah. What's your name? Jude. OK, Jude, you're doing really well. And his name's Eddie, yeah? Yeah, Eddie Walker. Did Eddie ever talk about any close friends that he had? He kept himself to himself. He did mention he'd been abroad. But I'm sorry. I think you need to sit down, Jude. All right, OK. The killer must have staked this place out. It's careful planning, again. Eddie Walker came back from volunteer work in Bosnia totally disaffected. Ended up on the street. Well, I hope you cleaned your teeth. Pass code? Freeze. Zoom in there. Shit. Shit. That-- that's, uh, that's Raymond Mackie. What? It's No it's not. That's James Keller. I recognize him from his wife's photos. He's supposed to be dead. - So which one of you is right? - Hold on. Hold on. Bruce? He gave me his driving license as proof of ID. You mean you spoke to this man in the past 48 hours? OK, whatever he said, we need to know, Mark. There's nothing to tell, lads. Well, I know I've got his address here somewhere. We'll get to that. Right now, we need to know about this guy. - What did he tell you? - I've got it. Mark. I've got his bloody address. Mark! Stupid, bloody-- damn you. Damn you. Shit. Come on. Come on. Please. What is all this? The speaker's under the floor. What do you think, Marion? The film and the sound may mean he's reliving an experience, trying to block out a trauma. And in order to do that, he has to recreate it. His inspiration, Colonel Raymond Mackie. What do we know about him? Very little-- missing in action, presumed dead. Just like Keller. So they might both be alive. I had him. He even bloody invited me in. Yet another error of judgment, just like killing Laney, yeah? This has nothing to do with Laney. What are you trying to prove, Mark? You're a good cop. You know that. Yes, so how come you write reports to cover up for me? You've got a choice. You can spend the rest of your life trying to make up for a mistake or you can live with it and do your job. You can't do both. I don't even remember why I took this job. I mean, what the hell am I doing here? Look at you and Creegan. You're always in there ahead of the bloody gate. I can't compete, Susan. It's not a bloody competition, Mark. There a problem? No problem, just, uh, just a little pep talk. I've got to go. Come with me. I need your help. Who are they? Well, that's what I need you to find out. You realize that this is all for you, don't you? What? He knew you'd come back. This is a message. Saying what? Well, laughing at me for letting him go. No, not at all. It's more likely he's trying to explain himself to you. Raymond Mackie, Bosnia, these women, all these people, they're linked somehow. These images are cries from the heart. He can't be alive. I buried him. Ann. I bought a coffin. I paid an undertaker to fill it with sand. There was a funeral. When there's no body, there's no ending. Where is he? Somewhere in England. I don't know what to feel. Huh, I suppose I should feel happy or something. But, um, I can't. All that time waiting for him to come home, I couldn't even mourn for him. Uh, he might turn up here. And we need to know if he does. You might be in danger. He wouldn't hurt me. He cares too much about people. That's the trouble. That's why he went to Bosnia because he thought he could change things. He thought he could end the war. He wouldn't hurt anybody. Hello, Jackie. Jim? I thought you were dead. Hard to keep a good man down. Let's get inside. Keller drifted from one job to the next, never found any satisfaction in any of them. He was prone to depression. Ah, so he went to Bosnia to cheer himself up. Now, Colonel Raymond Mackie was honored for bravery in the Falklands War, again in the Gulf, and met Keller in Bosnia. They became best buddies. MOD reckoned they were killed by a land mine. Hang on. It's just something Ann Keller said. She couldn't mourn her husband's death without a body. He's sending them home for their families. And the sheets? Um, shrouds? No, it's not shrouds. They're body bags. He's sending them home in body bags. I really wanted to find you. So tell me what happened to you and Ray. One day, I woke up, and you were both gone. Slummed around Europe for a while. Didn't want to go home. Didn't feel we could. Of course. What happened to Ray? I thought you two were joined at the hip. It was terrible, all that blood. What? Ray is dead. God, no. I-- he killed himself. Can't get it out of my head. Jackie? Just when I think I'm getting over it, I'll see a woman who looks a bit like her. And-- I'm OK. It never leaves you, does it? Never. What we need is to have some fun. Fun? There's still no work on Mackie. I've put a team on it though. We're using, um, tracer companies. They're doing some hospital searches, talking to all relatives, friends. We'll find him. Well, I'm ahead of you both. This woman here is Lisa Matthews. She was killed in Bosnia definitely. But this woman is definitely alive. Her name's Jacqueline Parker. And that's her address. She's not in. Neighbor? Welcome to the Thorpe Park information line. Our opening hours are 9:00 AM at 10:00 PM Monday to Sunday. Thanks. Thanks. No sign of them yet. Got him. All units standby. [inaudible] suspect in here-- no way out. Mark! Out of the way! Jim? What are you doing? April the 12th and the 14th. What? April the 12th and the 14th, remember that. Th Jim? Jim! Get out. Get out. Keller, get out. Get out! Shit. Yes, is something wrong? Don't give me that. Why did you say your name was Mackie? Who? I don't understand. You're lying. Have we met before? I'm sorry. End of round one. Everything's circumstantial. We'll have to push him hard to get a judge. Even so, do you think it's wise to let Rivers near him? Oh, he'll be fine. He didn't look fine to me. I thought about sending him home. After what happened, he needs to be in there. Fair enough, if you think you can control him. He can control himself. Ouch. Got the bastard, didn't I? You did You're a star. Lucky punch, was it? That's not funny. Come on, Mark. I need you in there. And just play it cool, and we'll be fine, OK? Yeah. Ah, at last. Sit down, Jim. What am I doing here? Nobody's told me. That's why we're here. Sit down. Any idea who this is? No. This, Johan Valent, same question. Same answer, sorry. Joseph Glenn, and they just keep on coming. Sorry, I got no idea. Eddie Walker. Look, um, I'm sorry I can't help you. But I still don't understand why I'm here. You're saying you've never seen this man before. No. If you tell me why I'm here, maybe I can help you. - You're a liar. - I'm sorry? Why did you run away? I didn't. But it looks like I shouldn't. Uh, look, I am trying to be helpful. Can I get you a cup of tea? Fine. What was the point of that? We've got him on tape with Eddie Walker. He can't get out of that. The man is being polite. For the moment, that's all we're going to get. So what are you saying? We are not going to get him like this. This man has been sitting in a cell all night working out what he's going to say. So calling him a liar isn't going to rattle his cage. We need to find a different approach. Do you understand? Creegan, I think we've got something. Well, we've been checking foreign hospitals for unknown victims or unidentified cases. And this popped up-- a man walking down the street wearing a white bed sheet, blood pouring from his head. Only this time, he survived. - Where? - I think Romania. I've got a fax coming through. Now, is that who I think it is? Raymond Mackie. So our man of mystery is English. He's not uttered a word since he's been here. So we didn't know. Well, he's not said anything? No, he Says nothing and does nothing. Mind you, it's not very surprising in the circumstances. What do you mean? This way, please. I have no idea how came to be so badly injured, but whoever did this to him-- maybe, I don't know-- but it looks like crude lobotomy. Some friends from me England to see you. Maybe you can succeed where we have failed. Maybe. Hello, Colonel Mackie. How is he? Any change? The same. Bloody wouldn't know. OK, this time, try and use a little [inaudible].. Right. Would that be before or after I beat him up? Are you sure you're fine? I'm a big boy, Dave, OK? Mark, Jackie Parker's in reception. She wants to talk to you. She'll have to wait. Not after the stunt you pulled last night. I've told her you'll be right down. Go and see what she wants. It's all right. Sit down. OK, Jim, let's talk about Raymond Mackie. No. Do you know this man? Please. Please. Please. Please. Take it. Please. Do you know this man? Do you know where he is? - He's dead. - How did he die? - He killed himself. - Really? How? Cut his wrists. Why? I can't talk to you about it. Try. Ms. Parker. Where's Jim? He's being interviewed. Well, I want him released now. Yeah, I'm afraid that won't be possible. On April 12 and 14, Jim Keller was with me. No, he wasn't. I want to make a statement. We know where he was and what he did on those dates. I want to make a statement. So how well did you know Raymond Mackie? He was my best friend. Well then, you must know why he wanted to kill himself. Do you tell your best friend everything? On something like that, yeah, I think I would. Ah, yeah, I don't want to talk about this. I think I'd want my best friend to help me. You don't-- you don't know what you're saying. No? You'd want him to help you kill yourself? No, I meant stop me. I'd want him to stop me. You see, the thing is, I don't believe a word you're saying, Jim. I don't believe you don't know who these people are, and I don't believe Raymond Mackie committed suicide. Everything I've told you is the truth. Look at the door, Jim. Ray, Ray. Ray, is that you? They found him in Romania, Jim, wandering the streets. If I tell you his head was bleeding and all he had on him was a white sheet, would that make any sense to you? This isn't fair. You see? And what happened? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You thought you killed him. Please, please forgive me. You failed. Why did you want to kill him, Jim? You wouldn't understand. No one understands. No one cares about what we saw. I care, Jim. Tell me. You're lying! How could you? How could you do this? Come on, Jackie. He was with me. I'm providing him with an alibi, and now, I demand you release him. We've got evidence that he was with Eddie Walker on the 14. - No. - Do you know what he's done? He's responsible for the murder of four people. And right now, he's being interviewed. They're going to crack him. If you give him a false alibi, then you're involved as well. As a lawyer, you should know that. Jim Keller is one of the most gentle men I've ever met. He isn't capable of murder. Frieda Halt, remember her? Johan Valent, him? Joseph Glenn? Eddie Walker? They're all dead, Jackie. The only one he didn't succeed in killing was you-- you and Raymond Mackie. Ray committed suicide. He's alive. I've seen him. What? Oh, my god. You haven't told Jim, have you? It was the latter, Jackie. Do you realize what that will do to him? That is not out problem. You have no idea. I understand. What, seeing women made to dance while their feet are chopped to pieces? Seen that, have you? Seen families murdered in their own living rooms? Hm, I'll bet you'd live fine with that, wouldn't you? Wouldn't bother you one bit, not like us. Nobody should have to suffer like us. Oh, that's what this is about. Their pain, that's what you've been doing. You're taking their pain away, wiping the memories from inside their heads. Is that why you killed them? You'll never understand what's in here. Well, tell me. Come on, Jim. No, no, I love him. I love them. And you killed them, didn't you? Nobody should have to see what we saw. What Ray did, nobody could compare with that. You couldn't come close to being the hero that Ray was. You're nothing. I've had enough now. I don't want to talk about it to you anymore. Shall we go home now? We're not finished. I need you now. My best friend, Lisa, was running the volunteer group. That's why I went. She'd been seeing Ray since he'd left the army. They were very much in love, expecting their first child. Jim was a friend of Ray's. When I met him, we just-- you know. Tell me about Lisa. A group of us had to go to this village that had been shelled over the weekend. Before we knew what was happening, they were all around us. And they took Lisa. She was gone for ages. And when we saw her next, they'd taken all her clothes and soaked her in petrol. She was just standing there too scared to move. One of them, he had this box of matches. They were going to burn her alive. That's when Ray did the most difficult thing in his life. He'd found a gun abandoned in the village. He shot her. It was the most heroic thing I've ever seen. But I think we all died inside that day. Ever since, it's been a question of just holding on. Jim's a wonderful man, but he's weak. You shouldn't have told him. We have to let him go. But we follow him, tight surveillance at a distance. Jackie-- We can not let this guy on the streets. Jackie's also a witness to police assault. So we give him some space. Why don't we just supply the bastard with weapons? It's all over now, Jim. It's finished. Just let it go. Whatever they told you, it's not true. I haven't done anything. I know. Are you ready? Get out. Where is he? Over there. Shit. Oh, Jim. Jim. Leave me be. Please. Take it. Jim, please. Take it away, Jim. I don't want to die. I don't want to die.
