 Enjoying your meal? [inaudible] The seafood's always fresh. [TIRES ON GRAVEL, ENGINE SHUTTING OFF] [pounding on door] Hello. Speak English? [inaudible]. I'm looking for Michael Yergi. Who sent you? Hansen. So, arrangements for tomorrow. Everything's in hand. We can't afford any more disasters.

 Absolutely. Look, I've contacted the others personally. Everything's OK. If everything was OK, we would not be here. I think perhaps it would be wise if I - supervise the arrangements. - There's no need. You will forgive me if I do not choose to trust. [inaudible]. I will, however, trust you to take care of the bill. This seems in order. You have a package for me? Once I see the child. We have many children. The package, please. I'd like to see the child now. This is not enough. I thought it was agreed. The price is more. The agreed price was 15,000. You'll make more than double that. I ask only 500 more. No deal. [water dripping] You must choose. [children's voices, rattling] You choose the child. [plaintive music playing] You have to choose. Please, please. You have to choose. Come on. Please, please. Please, please, please. Pick me! Please! [door slams, locks] I'll get papers. Does she have a name? I think this is Mischa. Carrie, you OK? What do you want, Dave? I came to see how you were. Yeah, well, I'm just fine. You can go. No. No. I'll stay a while. I don't say, don't worry Dave. It wasn't your fault. Don't blame yourself. Nope. That's what you want to hear, Dave. It's what you always want to hear. Carrie, I didn't know this was going to happen. He took the kids to see her grave. What? He could have done anything to them. This is finished. What're you doing? Linda? This thing is destroying you. I'm getting rid of it. - Give that to me. - No. Give it to me. She's dead, Michael. Give me the video. Give it to me. You can't keep her alive by watching this thing every minute of the day. Give me the video. Please, Michael, listen to me. Give me the video. Please. No. Give me the video! No! [woman sobbing] [car door opens, closes] Look what you've done! Look what you've done! [tv crashes to floor] Hawkins! [pounding on door] Hawkins! [rifle clicks] Michael, no! [pounding on door] Hawkins! Michael! [pounding on door] Hawkins! [pounding on door] Hawkins! [pounding on door] Michael! Hawkins! Where is he? Where is he? He went out the back! Control, this is Creegan. Control. I need assistance. Now you stay here. I'll be back soon. You can't understand a word I'm saying, can you? [car door shuts] Do you want me to take her to the local police? - No. - [inaudible]. They'll only send her back. But-- Just look after her. Her name is Mischa. [car door opens, closes] [music playing] Thank you. (VOICE ON SPEAKER): I've contacted the others personally. Everything's OK. (PAUL SAVANT ON SPEAKER): If everything was OK, we would not be here. I think perhaps it would be better if I supervise the arrangements. (VOICE ON SPEAKER): There's no need. (PAUL SAVANT ON SPEAKER): You will forgive me if I do not choose to trust you with the arrangements. A Whatever they're here for takes place tonight. Seems to me like Nesmith messed something up. Dave? What? The tape. Sorry. What were you saying? Are you up to this? Why wouldn't I be? We've got Hawkins' picture circulating. Every officer in the city is looking for him. We're fine, ave. And then everything will be OK. Right? What's happening about Steven? Because I was thinking if you spoke to Hansen, if you reasoned with him, maybe he'd tell you the truth. You know I can't do that. Do you think Hansen is involved with these men? Somebody tried to kill you. Not Hansen. You don't know that. - He's not the type. - They never are. You OK? Something's happened. [airport noises] You get complacent. Things drift. You turn a blind eye because it suits. Yeah, we catch Hawkins. Back to normal. Until the next time. Might not be a next time. How can I know? Now how can I take that chance? So, what do you do? We break the connection. Send Carrie and the kids away. Somewhere I can't find them. Somewhere safe. Somewhere I'm not a danger to them. Same goes for you, Annie. Well, don't I get a say? Sorry. I want them moved away. New life. New IDs, the works. We already have them under guard. It's not enough. Hawkins won't get near them. This isn't just about Hawkins. As long as I'm working here, my kids are at risk. I can't live with that. I've talked to Carrie and Barry. They're all for it. Dave, as you well know, the system is for protecting witnesses which Carrie and Barry are patently not. I'm not sure I can justify this. Then I'll have to resign. What? I will not risk my kids' lives another second. OK. Let me make a few calls. One more thing. I don't want to know where they've gone. [somber music playing] [intense music playing] [rifle clicks] You come to kill me, Michael? What are you doing here? I came to pay my respects. You mean ease your conscience. Yeah, maybe that as well. Yeah. Hands above your head! Do it! It would be so easy to kill you. So get it done, man, will ya? You want to share my pain. Remember? Well, you think I don't feel it? You think I don't understand? How could you? How could you possibly understand what it's like to lose everything that you've ever loved, that ever had any meaning? - Well, I'm feeling it, Michael. - No. Right now. No. But by God you will. What the hell do you think you're playing at? This is Mischa. You were under strict instructions, strict orders to hand her over to the Albanian authorities. I couldn't leave her. Not in that place. Do you have any idea what you've done here? This could turn into a major international incident. I brought her through customs. Nobody blinked. They didn't care. They've cared enough to lodge a complaint with the British embassy. I told them it was a misunderstanding to buy some time to repair the damage. I mean, what the hell were you going to do with a child? I hadn't thought that far ahead. I just had to get her out of there. Social Services will be here shortly. I want you back in your office while you've still get a job. But they'll send her back. It's not for us to decide what happens to her. You wouldn't say that if you'd seen the place. Susan-- I will not let you send her back. Detective! Listen to me very carefully. Not only is your career on the line. They might even lock you up for this. I'm doing my best to keep you out of prison. Do you understand? I want you to go to your office and stay there. Move it! [somber music playing] [BOOKS, PAPERS CLATTER TO FLOOR, SOBBING] [gun clatters to floor] [susan weeping, gasping] OK, you're all aware of the worldwide trade in children. But the scale of this will take your breath away. You're looking at trade routes. The commodity, children. Kids are being moved all over the world. Brought from South America, Asia, even Europe. Bought and sold into sex, prostitution, pornography. They even use some of them for organ transplants. Now one claim puts the figure at one million kids moved every year. And the going rate is about $30,000 a kid-- double or triple that for Western kids. Less chance of AIDS. This is from the Dutch police. You'll recognize Stahl. The other man is called Janz Devers. He is one of Holland's leading judges. Mr. Devers again, this time in the south of France. His mate's in the picture, a Frenchman, Michel Lambor. I know Lambor. French copper. He's a Chief Inspector. And the other man is called Mansfield. He's the headmaster of a Dutch private school. The Spanish sent this picture. They didn't have the connection to Stahl, so I sent them the details. The Dutch reckon if we can nab that three, the whole pack of cards is going to come tumbling down. Creegan seemed pretty strung out. Chasing a bunch of perverts. Perverts? Pedophiles. Should be strung up. If anybody wants to kill me, I'll be in the shower. [water running] (VOICE OVER SPEAKER): Everything's in hand. We can't afford any more disasters. Look, I've contacted the others personally. Everything's OK. (PAUL SAVANT OVER SPEAKER): If everything was OK, we will not be here. If everything was OK, they wouldn't be here. Maybe they had to fix Nesmith's mistakes. Or close down the whole show before something else goes wrong. Matthew Stone turned up. Heathrow Airport. Woman was trying to take him out of the country. - Fancy that. - Police are holding them. - Let them go. - Oh, you're kidding. We get on their tail, we see where she takes the kid. The child could be in danger. Oh what, you think I don't know that? Liaise with the Dutch. Get on her tail. There's something we're missing. Annie Jordan kidnaps her own kid. They try to kill her. But Hansen claims-- wait a minute. The Jenkins. They knew about Annie. [suspenseful music playing] Daddy! Whoo! Look at you pair! [girls giggling] [knocking on door] You're going to go on a trip. New house. Lots of new friends. You can come too. I can't, Honey. I'm too busy just now. You can come to visit. Well, maybe one day, OK? OK. OK. It's time to go. [somber music playing] (VOICE OVER RADIO): Creegan. DI Creegan, come in. Creegan. (VOICE OVER RADIO): Savant and Nesmith are on the move. [jet engine, rotors whirring] Where are they headed? (VOICE OVER RADIO): Heading north. They've got themselves a bloody helicopter. [helicopter rotors whirring] Control, come in. Get on with Heathrow and see if you can track them. [pursuit music playing] [indistinct conversation] Looks like it hasn't been used in years. [telephone ringing] (VOICES OVER TELEPHONE): Everything's ready. What about the kids? If everything goes according to plan, should be with you in a couples of hours. Good work. [dial tone] [dialing phone] DI Creegan, please. (VOICE OVER TELEPHONE): I'm sorry, he's not in the office. Can you get a message to him, please? It's really urgent. (VOICE OVER RADIO): DI Creegan. DI Creegan, come in. Creegan. (VOICE OVER RADIO): No luck with radar. They must be flying too low. Shit! (VOICE OVER RADIO): We have a message for you from an Annie Jordan. How are they? A little bit nervous, but that's to be expected. [helicopters landing] [ominous music playing] This is Sandra and Jonathan. A pleasure to meet you. Your work is much appreciated. Where are the children? They're in a side room. I would imagine you want to say your good byes. We will wait in the helicopter. Once again, thank you. [children playing] - Steven! - Get away from me! You have to come with me! Now don't shout. Just listen to me. Listen. These people want to hurt you. They want to hurt you. Steven. You have to come with me. Get off me! You're not my mum! [steven screaming] [interposing voices] I really wouldn't do that. Don't move! [helicopter rotors] [ominous music playing] We should've stayed in the chopper. They would have found us. Could be abroad by now. They would have tracked us, found us, and how would that look? What the hell do we do? We remain calm. They will come for us, but they have nothing on us. Your alibi. Memorize it. [door opens, closes] Paul Savant? What is this? We've been looking for you, Paul. This man. He was definitely there. And this man. And this man. I'm certain. This is Reggie Hansen. He wasn't there. Tell them about my baby. You have to tell them. OK, we're done here. Look, please! Tell them! You have nothing on me. I have done nothing wrong. What were you doing at the airfield? Airfield? What were you doing at the airfield? I told you. I was at a friend's house. We took a helicopter to the house and we stayed there all afternoon. How do you feel about little boys. Paul? That is an offensive question. Oh, but I thought it was a natural thing, the love of children. I do not understand. I've got two little girls. I love them to bits. I, too, like children, of course. But you said that was offensive. That's not what I meant. So what did you mean, Paul? Why would the thought of little boys be offensive to you? You are putting words into my mouth. Your words, Paul. Little boys. Offensive question. Your words. Your mind. What time would this be? Three in the afternoon. Three? I was at a friend's house at 3:00. Any luck? They've got their stories well rehearsed. Same here. Their alibi checks out. Big country house. Staff claim they arrived by helicopter, stayed all day. They've all been bought. We have Annie Jordan's ID. Her word against theirs. There's a lot of circumstantial here. We might have to cut some deals. No. No deals. We hold on to them. Put them through the process. Get them on remand. One of them will crack. I still think Hansen's the key. DI Creegan. DI Taylor. You'll forgive me if I don't look surprised. You knew. Please, tell me I don't look that stupid. We've already got you on illegal importation of children, anything else you'd like to share with us? I know nothing about any child abuse. But you know Paul Savant. You'd like me to go through that once more? I think you know the kind of animal Savant is. He was a business associate, nothing more. Come on, Reggie. These are sick men. You want them to go free? You know. You've seen with your own eyes what these children suffer. And what about the victims of these men? Don't they suffer? Listen, I'm not ashamed of what I've done. I'd do it again. In fact, when I get out of here, I'll carry on doing it. You see, you keep avoiding the subject, Reggie. We're talking about evil bastards screwing little boys and girls! Nothing to do with me. Do you keep track of them? All these kids you've saved? Do you know where they are now? Some of them. Some of them. So how do you know some of them don't end up in bed with guys like Savant. That's ridiculous. Annie's baby nearly did. It's true. The couple you sold the baby to were pedophiles. They bought the baby, brought him up, used him for God knows what. Tell us what you know, Reggie. Let us put these bastards away. I've told you all I know. [hand slams on table] [door opens, closes] Come back in a couple of hours, will you? Are you OK? Been better. Steven's safe. He'll be made a ward of court for a while, just till this is over. Then you'll get him back. He doesn't even know how I am. He thinks I'm the madwoman who keeps trying to snatch him. At least you get to see him growing up. I'm sorry, Dave. What was that for? I could lie and say it was for saving my life. So what's the truth? The truth's much simpler than that. [street noises] [music playing] [door slams shut] [knock on door] [door opens] Taxi's here. How do I look? Ask them. They're not biased. [helicopter hovering] [horn beeping] Don't be nervous. It's just a preliminary hearing to establish the charges. You'll be asked to ID them, nothing more, OK? OK. Are we set? What's wrong? Was thinking about when this is all over. Thinking maybe we could see each other. You know, from time to time. No commitments. Nothing too close. [suspenseful music playing] Annie? No! Annie! Annie! No! Annie! No! Annie! [rifle clicks] [gunshot, glass shatters] [gunshots continue] [brakes squeal, debris clatters] [gunshots] Where's Annie? [pursuit music playing] Hawkins! HAWKINS: [indistinct shouting] Hawkins! HAWKINS: You feel it now? [pursuit music playing] HAWKINS: You understand? Do you feel it, Creegan? This is how it Creegan. Pull the trigger. Creegan! Feel it now? For the rest of your life you'll feel it. Creegan, no! Let him do it. [gunshot] - Annie! Annie! No! SUSAN: Dave-- So what do we do now? SUSAN: What? We lost a key witness. She was more in that, Dave. I think we should target Hansen. Dave-- He knows more than he's saying. We bring him in and we break him. It's OK, Dave. It's OK to let it out. Bring him in. Take a seat, Reggie. What am I doing here? - Take a seat. - What's going On Sit down! [CHILDREN SINGING - "Ring Around the Rosie"] We lost the key witness, Reggie, Which means we can't place the bad men at the scene of the crime. Which means they go free. Unless maybe you can help us. Turn it off. Turn it off! Amsterdam sent us this film. We traced the little boy. He's one of yours, Reggie. No! Albanian. He knew Yergi. Name's Elian. Remember Elian? Please-- Turn it off. Please. [remote beeps] I brought him through myself. A couple, they seemed OK. They really did. I was only ever trying to help them. I never dreamt it would turn out like this. You understand. I felt the same. This isn't helping, Reggie. I knew about Savant. He came to me. He asked me if I'd get him some kids. I told him where to get off. You'll say that on court? I say that in court, I'm a dead man. We'll get you protection. Protection. Can't hide from these people. I'm putting you on the witness stand. And is it true you were approached by Mr. Savant? Mr. Hansen? We had a meeting, yeah. And what transpired at that meeting? He wanted to involve me in his operation. He offered me a fortune to get him some children. He asked you to buy him children for his pedophile organization. HANSEN: Yeah. That's right. [theme music]
