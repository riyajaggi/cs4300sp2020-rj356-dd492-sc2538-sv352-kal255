 The man has just been shot. You're putting pressure on him. I've been there, remember? You lie about in places like this, you start to think too much. Steven! Steven! Let me alone! Get off me! Stop it! Leave me alone! You're hurting my arm! Get away from me! Look, it's OK, Steven. Get off me! It's OK. Just listen to me, listen. I'm your mum, Steven! Mum! Mum! I'm your mum. Paul Savant. Supposed businessman. Arrived in London three days ago. Suspected links with an international pedophiliac ring. Nothing proved so far. You're looking at James Nesmith. British resident. Again, suspected links to pedophilia. Several investigations and nothing proved. Calvin Stahl, Norwegian. Yet another businessman. Yet another suspect who was once charged in France with molesting a young boy. He got off. He arrived in Britain yesterday. Quite a party. Any contact between them? French police sent us this. Stahl and Nesmith in a restaurant in Paris. This was about three months ago. No contact with Savant. No, not so far. What the hell are they doing here? Well, the two of them together at the same time could be a coincidence. Three? Then there's something going on. OK, we're in the spotlight with this. Every branch and every force in Europe is watching us. I want 24-hour surveillance on Savant. Let's start with his hotel room. It's going to play [inaudible] this evening. Well, if you remember, last week Peter was just about to play-- wizardry to ensure fantastic results almost every time. You can go on location with Light Tripod. Extra battery [inaudible]. So standby. Cue the action. Single bullet each. They didn't even have time to move. Was it professional? Looks like it. Where's the kid? What kid? We've got a missing kid. I just got the report from CID. Kidnapped from his garden in broad daylight. Steven Jenkins. Well, that's wrong. His name is Matthew Stone. No, it says Jenkins. Parents were shot through the head. Steven's parents are alive. They reported the kidnap. Two of them. She snatched him from the back garden. She? One of the neighbors saw her. To the car registration. We'll find it. It must've been a minute at the most. I left him playing there, and I heard him shout. Did you see the woman? She had gone by the time we arrived. How the hell can this happen? We'll find him. Would you like a drink? I bought you some juice. When you were a baby, I couldn't afford to keep you. And that's why I gave you to somebody who could. I never wanted to give you away, Steven. Please believe that. You're not my mum. Definitely her car. How many flats? 20. Annie Jordan's on the fourth floor. Annie Jordan? Get off me! Are you OK? He's mine! He's mine! It's OK. Come on, you're going to be fine. Good lad. Why did you kidnap that boy? Because he's my son. You can prove that? No. You have his birth certificate. No, I handed all those over-- Come on, Annie, Mr, and Mrs. Jenkins have shown us his birth certificate with their names on. He's their child. He's my son. What's this? I don't understand. 10,000 pounds deposited in your bank account 10 days ago. No, that was-- I was left the money. That's why I wanted him back. Who left you the money? My father. He died a month ago. He left me the money in his will. And you can check that. We will, don't worry. He's my boy. I gave him away when he was a baby. Are you saying you had him adopted? That's right. So how come Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins have no memory of his adoption? They don't want to give him up. Matthew Stone. - Ring any bells? - I don't know him! Look, what's going on here? He went missing as well. I don't know anything about this. I think somebody put you up to this, Annie. They go free and you get charged with kidnapping. You will be lucky to get away with 10 years. You give us the name of your contact. I don't have a bloody contact! I just want my baby back. Her story about money checks out. Could it have been set up? No, unlikely. Maybe she's telling the truth. She's hiding something. We'll let her sweat for a bit. Michael! I didn't mean to shout at you. You know how it is sometimes. You were right about your studies. You need some time off. I don't mind. Michael! I will all be over tomorrow. I promise. And then you can go where you like, do what you want. Michael, it's getting late! Somebody will pay. They'll all pay. I'll make sure of it. The next case touches on the death of Emily Hawkins. We're not here to apportion blame, Mr. Hawkins. They could have saved her. Our purpose here is simply to ascertain the cause of death. We wouldn't be here if he'd done his job. Mr. Hawkins, please. Somebody should pay. - He should pa! - Please stand down. He'll tell you he was acting in my best interest. Mr. Hawkins-- He'll tell you there's nothing he could have done. If you don't stand down I will have you removed from this court. They're covering up for each other! That's all I have to say. Please strike all that from the court record. When I arrived in the shack, Emerson had a knife at Miss Hawkins' throat. He threatened to kill her. I tried to talk him out of it. I didn't think he'd do it. You witnessed the accused administer the fatal blow? Detective Creegan? Detective Creegan? Yes, sir. Thank you, Detective. That will be all. Ask him what the hell he was doing there! Mr. Hawkins-- Ask him what normal procedure is, why he didn't wait for assistance. I will not warn you again. Clear the court! Clear this court! Settle down. You'll pay, Creegan! Wait outside. It's fine. Come on, you want to fight? Come on again. Oof! Again! Come on, Michael, you can do better than that. Had enough? You want more? Oh, you want to kill me, is that it? Somebody has to pay. Emerson will pay. - Emerson killed your daughter. - No! You! You killed her! You made a mistake! Then what are you waiting for? Somebody killed my kid, I'd kill them for sure. But you're not sure, Michael. Emerson's the one you want. But you can have him, so you come me. No. You. You're all part of it. Yeah, you're right, Michael. There's nobody blameless here. What are you saying? You taught yourself right. Your fault. All that pain. Nobody deserves that kind of pain, so you dish it out. And maybe if you dish it out, then some of it might leave you. You can't even get close to that kind of pain. No? If I could take the slightest bit of your pain away, I would. Creegan! Remember you said that. Mum! Steven! My baby! You're safe now. We've contacted all the adoption agencies. There's no record of you or the Jenkins. The records must have been destroyed. Why would they do that? Look, I don't know anything about records or agencies. All I know is that Steven is my son. You see, you keep saying that, Annie. The trouble is you can't back it up. All we see is a woman tried to snatch a kid that doesn't belong to her. It does belong to me. Yeah? So prove it to us. I can't. Read the charge. Annie Jordan, you are hereby charged-- OK. OK. You didn't find any records because there aren't any. My life was a mess, I was living in squats. I didn't want that for him. I sold him. I couldn't take care of him. The chance was there, so I sold him. You're saying the Jenkins paid to you for your baby? Not the Jenkins. A man called Reggie Hansen. He deals in kids. We've checked relatives, neighbors, even interviewed schoolmates. No sign of Matthew. You her story? She's too smart to make this up. Snatching a kid in broad daylight. Yeah, that's smart. Results on Hansen. Well, what do you know? He has a record. No convictions, but was the subject of a surveillance operation two years ago. Looks like he was taking too many holidays abroad. I was wondering if either of you had ever come across this guy. Name's Reggie Hansen. Who is he? Well, Annie Jordan claimed she sold her baby to this man, who in turn sold the baby to you. I don't believe this. It's OK, Sandra. First she takes our son. Now she tries to blame us. Who's side are you on? Sandra-- Look, we've shown you all our papers. What more can we do? The woman is obviously around the bend. OK, Reggie Hanson. Made a lot of money out of computer printer company. Big shot. Insurance, charities, particularly hospices. Tipped for the honest list. And came to our attention a few years back taking 75 trips abroad in one year. Investigations drew a blank. Looked like just small business trips-- at least that's what we thought at the time. These pictures were taken at a London restaurant. Paul Savant. We didn't know him then. And these trips abroad, where did he go? Various places. Mainly Albania. We could bring him in, apply some pressure. No, if he's connected to the three wise men maybe we can use him. Must have been hard. Give up your child. You believe me? Well, let's just say I'm listening. Don't know what else there is I can tell you. How did you find Hansen. A woman I met in one of the squats. She'd sold her baby the Hansen. Just phoned him up, he arranged everything. Private hospital. Even put me up in a flat for a while. How much did he pay you? Oh, does it matter? Don't have to tell me. Five grand. Got me on me feet. Not a minute's passed that I didn't regret it. So how did you find the Jenkins? Hansen refused to tell me at first, until I - threatened him with the police. - Blackmail? All I cared about was getting Steven back. I would've done anything. Bet Hansen loved you for that. That's the surprising thing. He seemed to understand. He seemed to really care about kids. Sounds good. Get out here as quick as you can. Yeah? There's a woman here, Mrs. Caroline Barnett? Never heard of her. She's most insistent she sees you. All right, send her in. Mr. Hansen? Mrs. Barnett, what can I do for you? I understand you can help me. Nice pad. Mr. Barnett's doing all right. Well, he is expecting 30 grand in cash for this kid. Perfect couple, you and me. Staying up nights, in front of a roaring fire, talking psychosis. I don't think I'd describe myself as psychotic. Maybe me, then. See, it's working already. We have the building surrounded. There are some officers in the house itself. Oh, I could definitely get used to this. Get your feet off the furniture. Really beginning to sound like a wife. I am the breadwinner in this relationship, remember. Yeah, I meant to talk to you about that. How come I don't get to be the successful lawyer? Work it out. All units in position, sir. OK, Maintain radio silence until further notice. He's here. Give me a moment there. Mrs. Barnett, Mr. Barnett, this is Nadia. Hello, Nadia. What the hell's going on? I've no bloody idea. I take it there is a good reason for all of this. Silent copes. There's a novelty. So I'll ask you some questions about what's going on and what am I doing here? Why did you arrest me? Don't I get a phone call? Don't I have a right to a lawyer? Let's start with where the girl came from. She's my niece. Doesn't speak any English. She was born and brought up in Albania. If you contact her parents, they'll tell you. I'll give you their address. Why were you giving her to Mrs. Barnett? Her mum's ill. Mrs. Responding kindly offered to look after her for awhile. As far as I know, there's no law against that, is there? Who's this man? Where'd you get this? This is Paul Savant, a former business associate. What kind of business? He's interested in running a French expansion of my printer business. We couldn't agree terms. Anything else? Sorry sir, there's a Mrs. Barnett downstairs. Says she's Mr. Hansen's lawyer. Is that true? Hello. I'm Michael. I'm a friend of your dad's. He told me to come and see you. As far as I can see, Mr. Hansen has given you his complete cooperation. Now, if there is a charge to be made against him, he would appreciate it would be fully laid out before proceeding. How about illegal importation of children? How about organizing an illegal adoption for profit? You're charging him with these offenses? I would also like to point out that if any false charges are made against my client, he will pursue the matter rigorously through the courts. How much you paying for the kid? Can I speak off the record? It seems to me that in order for you to bring charges you would need me to testify against my client. That won't be happening. Charge him or you let him go. This is my daughter. Her name's Emily. I thought it should meet her so that you'd understand. I have something to tell you that might shock you, but I think you should know. Your daddy killed her. Nice moves. I was clutching at straws. Glad you're on my side. I'm not on anybody's side. I have a vested interest in you being free. Do you need a lift? It's probably out of your way. That's OK. You OK? They charged me. I know, I'm sorry. We need more time with Hansen. Just hang in there. What will happen to me? You'll be sent to a woman's prison on remand. Just a couple of days before your bail hearing, and then you'll be released until the trial. And what if you can't prove anything against Hansen? We will. Why didn't you come to us in the first place? I thought about it. When I went to check on him and I saw him there, I just had to hold him. I can understand that. So how come you believe me? I get these hunches about people. Bit of an affliction. You're a kind man. You don't know me. Call it a hunch. Mind if I walk you to your van? I'd like that. Don't let this place get to you, OK? I won't. And thanks. For what? Believing. What the hell was that? Get out! Get out! Oh, for God's sake! You OK? What do you mean? Well, you weren't exactly quick on your feet. I wasn't sure what was happening. - You didn't hear me shout? - I head you, OK? I want to know who he was, who he was shooting at, and why. He was a pro. Probably contracted. Who would go to all that trouble just to take a pot shot at a cop? Oh, he wasn't shooting at us. Me? Why would somebody want to kill me? Because you are a threat. A threat to who? You can testify against Hansen. He might have some contacts that rather you didn't. Oh, not Hansen. This isn't his style. You know some powerful men. Until we catch them, you're a target, so you'll need protection. Do I get to pick the bodyguard? You know we can't send Annie to prison, not after this. Annie? Annie Jordan. You're on first-name terms? OK, we send her to prison, they can still get to her. We don't know she was the target. You want to take that chance? Beats the hell out of a prison cell. Well, give it a couple of days, you'll be climbing the walls. You staying? I'm a busy man. You'll come and see me? There's no need. These guys are good. I meant in your own time. I'd just like to say thanks for your support, Dave. What? Going behind my back to Enright. That's exactly what I need right now. Mark, I was worried about what happened. I what's going on. You know, maybe he's losing it. - Maybe he'll get us all killed. - No. Well, let's get this straight. I don't have a problem. I can do my job. And I won't be letting anybody down, OK? So what do we do? Where do we start? Let's start with how you're feeling. I'm feeling fine, thanks. How are you? OK. Good. Glad that's that sorted out. I feel a lot better. How did you feel when you took the bullet, Mark? I got this pain in my arm. I couldn't understand it. OK, I thought I was dead. No life flashing before my eyes. No regrets. I just thought, this is it then. Is that abnormal? No. So what the hell am I doing here? I was on a business trip. Eastern bloc. New frontiers, they say. Albania. I'm looking for a factory site. I meet this bloke. Tells me about a hospital, supposed to be derelict. So I pay it a visit. Place is only teeming with kids. As young as 2, old as 16. They live in shit. Half of them are basket cases. So you decided to help them. You can't look at that and do nothing. You can't. So I bring one of them home with me, and the word gets around the chattering classes. And soon I'm up to my neck in orders. What will you do now? Not much I can do, is there? I guess they'll be watching me now. The public must be protected, right? But who is it they think they're protecting, eh? I mean, it's not the children, that's for sure. Well, they won't be watching me. I still want a child. There's nothing I wouldn't do to get one. You don't realize what's involved. I don't care. You show me the ropes, I'll do the rest. Three miles along the main western road out of [inaudible] there's a signpost marked "Mara." That's the name of the hospital. And when I get there, I'm to ask for Yergi. He runs the place and speaks English, apparently. Give him the money. They supply the passport. Take my pick. Hansen doesn't suspect anything? He's too caught up in his own ego. You listen him talk, you'd think he was saving the world single-handed. Nearly had me believing him. We have a picture of him with Paul Savant, remember? The three wise men are sitting tight, obviously waiting for something. This is all we have. We follow the whole process through, we might find out something useful. But I want three officers covering every step of the way. What about the kid? As soon as you pick out the kid, you hand it over to the local police. They'll be expecting you. You'll send me a postcard. Not the sites I'll be seeing. Try not to start any international incidents. Keep close to the guys. I know what to do, Dave. Yeah, well. Good luck. I would have thought one copy was enough. You can take a break. Hi. You OK? Fine. A bit bored. Your own time, Creegan? Yeah it's as close as it gets. Any news? These things take time, You know, we've never had a proper conversation. Well, that's why I was here. So tell me about yourself. I'm a cop. And? That's it. What about you? I'm a free spirit. Much money in that? No. But plenty of job satisfaction. Mum. Shh, I'm watching this. Why did Daddy kill Emily? What did you say? Why did Daddy kill Emily? Who's Emily? The man said he killed her. What man? Daddy's friend. There's something unreal about this. What? Me in a hotel room with a strange man. Strange? No, not strange. Distant. Like nobody should come near you. - How's that? - Still a way to go. That better? You're getting there. Where the hell is he? Oh shit. Good Lord. Everything OK in there? He won't go till he's checked. One minute! You OK, Sir? Now that's what I call protection. Thought I'd better check, Sir. Sure. Good work. You can take over now. Something wrong, Sir? No. Just be vigilant. DC Rivers. I'll be right there. Renny, what's the big panic? Table in the corner. Shit. Paul Savant and his cronies. Creegan. Where have you been? Kerry, what's wrong? Someone's been talking to the kids. What do you mean? Who the hell's Emily? I'll be right over. You don't move. You don't answer the door. You don't do anything, OK?
