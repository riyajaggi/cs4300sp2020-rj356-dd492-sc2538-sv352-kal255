 Touching Evil (1997â€“1999): Season 2, Episode 2 - Scalping: Part 2 - full transcript 
 Emerson is captured and remanded in custody but Creegan is haunted by the fact that he was unable to arrive in time to save the last victim,Emily Hawkins. Even more disturbing is the fact that,though Emerson is now behind bars,another slaying and scalping takes place,a copy-cat killing,leading Creegan to believe that Emerson has either an accomplice or a warped admirer. Creegan is forced to make a deal with Emerson to catch this new murderer whilst Susan is in danger of becoming the latest victim.

 Shit. Shit! Work! What you're looking at, as I'm sure you all know, is a simplified model of psychological cyclic behavior. But to recap, in the days following the kill, the killer will experience feelings of exhilaration. He went through with it. He had the courage to do it. His fantasy has become reality. His self esteem is at its highest.

 Emerson knows who killed Foulds. What we need is a key to get him to open up. If you'll bear with me. Now, most of us tend to see serial killers as cold, calculating monsters with no human feelings. Quite the opposite is generally true. After the initial exhilaration, guilt begins to set in. They may try to deflect this guilt by blaming others, as is normally the case with copycats. However the guilt is expressed, there's a gradual down surge in the killer's self esteem. They feel compelled to regain that self esteem, to recapture that brief sense of exhilaration. The only way in which they can achieve this

 is by killing again. [music playing] Of course, it's never the same as the first time. The guilt phase comes more and more quickly. The killer is forced to find new ways to experience the same feeling. How does this help us with Emerson? It's my guess that Emerson might well be approaching a guilt phase. How that might manifest itself I've no idea, but when we find out we find his weakness. We have the tapes of your telephone conversations with Laney. He gave us them. A cheap trick. Laney wouldn't do that. Why not? Who told you about Margaret Foulds? Was it Laney? If I'm to help you, I want something in return. What? A lock of your hair. We don't need you that much. Come on. Susan. [music playing] [doorbell ringing] Hi. We'd like a word, Laney, back at the OSC. Cleaning lady got the day off? (ON TAPE) The women have to die. The balance must be restored. (ON TAPE) I know what you mean. (ON TAPE) Oh, you do? (ON TAPE) Some women go too far, right? (ON TAPE) Like everything in nature, there's a balance between men and women. (ON TAPE) Exactly. And some women upset that balance. (ON TAPE) You know, I really think you're beginning to understand. (ON TAPE) How do you choose the women? (ON TAPE) Gravity. (ON TAPE) I don't understand. (ON TAPE) Each of us exudes their own gravitational force that draws certain people to us. (ON TAPE) Do you hit them, the women? (ON TAPE) Science has no room for emotion. (ON TAPE) You see yourself as a scientist? (ON TAPE) Science of killing-- natural, logical. The complexity of structure, the natural animal drive tempered with our own capacity for thought. This is my dominion. (ON TAPE) Can it be learned? (ON TAPE) You wish to become my student? (ON TAPE) I want to learn. And did you? What? Learn? I got to know him pretty well, if that's what you mean. How well? Do you know, I really thought we might have had something, you and me. I thought we were sharing something, while all the time you were screwing me to keep me occupied while your buddy raids my flat. Nice work, officer. He didn't know? He could be a bloody murder suspect. I didn't know that then. How could be so bloody stupid? Some of us have got a life beyond this place! I'm sorry. You don't go anywhere near Laney. When did the conversations start? About a month ago. And you didn't think to inform us. I had every intention of letting you know the second I found out anything useful. How well did you get to know him? I've already answered that. - Well enough to imitate him? - What? When did you tell him about Margaret? Margaret? You discussed Margaret Foulds with Emerson when? Wait a minute, just what the hell has Margaret Foulds got to do with this? Look, OK, I'm a naughty boy. I should have given you the tapes. But this is research, pure and simple. Surely you can see that. Emily Hawkins is dead. Was that part of your research? That was your balls up. Don't pin it on me. Dave, enough! Some women go too far. She deserved it. I want to learn. Research? I was drawing him out, getting his trust. It's a recognized technique! Nothing on those tapes would have saved Emily Hawkins. What about Margaret Foulds? What is this with-- Foulds is dead? He seemed surprised by Foulds' death. He was bluffing. Everything on the tapes supports his research claim. So we can't make conspiracy. His lawyer's already kicking up a fuss. The best we can do him for is withholding evidence. Even that's on dodgy ground. There's nothing on the tapes we didn't already know. Emerson knew about Foulds. Laney was in contact with Emerson and doesn't have an alibi for the time Foulds was killed. Nor does he have a motive for killing her, - as far as I can see. - Well, he knew about her. He wrote about her. I thought that was his job. Keeping him here gets us nowhere-- heavy surveillance might. Hello, Ronnie. Come in. (ON RADIO) Yeah, this is Ronnie. You want to try hanging a flag out the window? (ON RADIO) What's that/ I can see your bloody lens. (ON RADIO) Sorry, sir. I'll move back a bit. All he needs is a good shagging. You got any suggestions? Has he moved yet? Over. (ON RADIO) He's still leaning on the wall outside the building. Over. He's been there three hours. What the hell's he playing at? Let's go see. What do you want? Back in there, I thought everyone knew. You've been waiting here all this time to tell me that? I just wanted you to know. (RADIO) Calling DI Creegan. DI Creegan, come in. Creegan here. (RADIO) He's just made a call. Where to? DI Taylor's flat. There's no reply. Thanks, Ronnie. I refuse to feel guilty about it. Did I say anything? And I do not want an issue made out of it. You keep it to yourself, OK? No snarky bloody remarks about me doing the same. Never crossed my mind. (RADIO) Laney's on the move. Over. CREEGAN: Don't lose him. [music playing] [doorbell rings] Well, you're nothing if not persistent. My best feature. Do I get to come in? I don't think that's a good idea. Right. So this is the brush off, then, is it? Where you tell me you don't want me any more, is that it? See, I don't actually believe that. I think you should go. OK. It's Creegan, isn't it? Creegan? That's OK. I've got the picture. (RADIO) He's now entering the newspaper offices. Over. Cover all exits. [music playing] Hey. Hey, hey, what are you doing? You can't go in there! [sirens] What have we got? Laney run a story about Foulds. It's over the top, great MP, et cetera, et cetera. He built her into some kind of hero. She wasn't the only one. [music playing] WOMAN: I'm locking up now. Excuse me. I'm locking up. Finishing my coffee. You've been nursing that for an hour. Paid for it. Yeah, well, don't give you the right to live here. What did you say? Sorry? What did you just say? Deborah Highsmith, high flying lawyer. She was tipped to become a judge. Found dead six months ago-- by all accounts, took an overdose. Margaret Foulds we all know about. Both women in positions of power, both with hidden secrets, one suicide, one murder. What you want? Let's start with an apology. - There's money in the till! - What's your name? What? Your name. It's Jan. Jan. Well, Jan, you've a bit of a sharp tongue, haven't you? (SHOUTING) Haven't you? - Yeah. Yeah. Whatever, there's money in the till. Just take it, please, just take it! I don't want the money. I want an apology! I don't understand what you want me to do. An apology! I'm sorry. What? I'm sorry. You see, I don't really think you are. Laney wrote stories about their success, followed by stories about their secrets. And now they're both dead. He is a reporter. He built them up. He gave them coverage, made them into celebrities, ah, ah, role models. And then he destroyed them. Highsmith committed suicide after Laney ran the story. He was doing exactly the same to Margaret Foulds. You're not really sorry. None of you are ever really sorry. You get a little bit of power and you think that makes you something special. There's a definite pattern here, too many connections to Laney. The collage on Emerson's wall, every headline written by Laney. Both victims women in power. The conversations with Emerson. Emerson's knowledge of Foulds' death. Emerson saw it. He understood the nature of things, the natural balance between the strong and the weak, between man and woman. We let Laney go because we couldn't see his motive for killing Foulds, and now we have one. Women in power. You looked at the other case? Definitely suicide. So why all of a sudden does he turn to murder? [knocking] Sorry to interrupt, sir. What is it? Laney's gone AWOL. I don't ask for much, just a little-- a little respect-- a little torment. Do you know what that means? Some show of conscience, penance for what you've done, for upsetting the balance. Is that so much to ask? [sirens] Any number of rows leading off. Could be anywhere. This is something you should know. Back at the shack, I-- I could have killed Emerson. He was dragging Emily into the shack, and uh, I had my gun on his back-- a clear shot. And I-- I just-- I just couldn't pull the trigger. I hadn't killed a man before. It-- it was just-- will you say something for God's sake? Get out. What? Get out. You're kidding. It happens, right? I mean-- it must have been the same for you. I mean, the first time. Get out of the car! Damn it! Damn him! [music playing] Still here? That makes two of us. You should get some sleep. So should you. [phone ringing] Creegan. I'm leaving now. Dudes. Dudes, I'd like you to meet, ah, Detective Inspector David Creegan. He's my good buddy from work. Buddies look out for each other, right? Come on. I can manage. But first, I need a splash. How many people have you killed, Dave? How many? He doesn't want to talk about it. Nobody wants to talk about it. Know how many I've killed? Zilch. Big fat zero. I've had my chances. Had no shortage of opportunities. It's just, never got round to pulling that trigger. I guess that means I'll go to Heaven, eh? What do you think, Dave? Think I'll go to Heaven? You want to go to Heaven? Get another job. Prefer the people I'd meet in Heaven-- nice people. No balls, no [inaudible]. Nice. [music playing] Oy! Five minutes! Easy now, come on! She's my daughter. Yeah, but you can't come in here. I want her back. Look, I understand. And I-- I'm sorry for you. But you got to come with us. I won't leave without her. Come on. I'm not leaving without her! I want her back! No! I want her back! I want her back! I want her back! [door opens] I did what I thought was right. Bullshit! You wanted to be the hero. No. Get your name in the paper. Officer saves the day. No. It's all this was to you, a bloody career move. I had to make a decision. You had to wait for help! That's what you had to do. That was all you had to do! Wait! How hard is that? If I'd waited for help-- If you'd waited for help she'd still be alive. We don't know that. As it she's lying in that bloody fridge and you put her there, Creegan! Somebody's going to pay for this. Oh, I'm paying. She's a bit of a mess. Jugular vein severed with a knife, and the killer's made a ham fisted attempt to cut off her hair. When he came to see you last night, what did he want? To know if we were still an item. I gave him the brushoff. A few hours later, he killed again. What do you think you're doing? We have to find Laney. No. I won't let you do this. What the hell else have we got? Definitely you. Oh, save it for later. Oh, I will savor it. Where do we find Laney? Something new has happened, or else you wouldn't be here. He killed another woman-- a cafe owner. What was her history? Ordinary. Married woman, two kids, mortgage, small business. No skeletons in the cupboard? None that we're aware of. And where did he kill her? In the cafe she owned. An interesting aberration. What is Laney's fixation? Women in power. Woman in power. His drive and his weakness. He desires them and he despises that desire. How can a man reconcile his need for domination with his need to remain a man? By killing the thing he desires. You're a fast learner. He didn't desire the cafe owner. Oh, he's chosen another victim, but this victim is difficult-- scares him. But he needs to kill where he must. The cafe owner, a chance encounter, satiate the need. But simply marking time. How does that help us find him? You already know where to look for him. A writer can't help but to bare his soul. The other victims were attacked first in the newspaper. He's coming after you. You need some protection-- bodyguards, maybe a safe house. He's obsessed with women in power. I don't think it's me who needs protecting. [music playing] Can't sleep? How did you get in? Our wonderful night together, found your spare key. What do you want? I want to see you again. You don't move. Looks like you got me. Does it make you feel strong, Susan? A gun in your hand, does it give you the edge? Through to the living room. (RADIO) Calling DI Creegan, come in. Go ahead, Mark. (RADIO) Yeah, we've got another message from Laney. You trace it? (RADIO) Came from the daily news. Right, I'll meet you there. Control, this is Creegan. (RADIO) Control. Yeah, DI Taylor's flat. I want two cars, front and back, and don't let her know you're there. You calling him? Creegan? You don't need him, Susan. Just you and me. What are you doing? Giving you another chance to make the right choice. Stop it. You and me, we belong together, need each other. I would do anything for you. You just have to name it. Get dressed. Just think what we could be together. I thought about trusting you. I really did. A little voice said, no. The voice was right. Tomorrow's front page. [sirens] Susan? Welcome home. Why here? The scene of your great arrest, and Creegan's big mistake. I'm going to swing some extra manpower. I've got over 100 officers on disposal. The question is where do they start looking? Could be anywhere. The fact that he sent a message means he's ego driven. He has a need to let us know, to involve us. It isn't enough for him to kill. He has a desire to feel clever, to feel he's outsmarting us. Which means we might have missed something. Emerson knows where she is. Who's this? Where did you get that? Bedroom chest, bottom drawer, under old tights. Someone special? His name's Jonathan. An old boyfriend. We're engaged. Where is he now? He died. Shame. And you've never found anyone like him since. You keep looking, hoping this will be the one. But it's never the same. All those partners, all those men, none of them were ever Jonathan. Why are you doing this? What about me? How did I compare? You didn't. What about Creegan? Nobody Nobody compares. You're lucky, you know that? Right now I don't feel so lucky. Well, you had someone special, even for just a short time. Some people go through their whole lives looking, hoping-- nothing happens. Like you? I thought maybe you were special. I didn't reckon on Creegan. I told you before, there's nothing-- - Don't lie to me. - I'm not lying! You're always lying! Cheating, anything to get where you want to go and it doesn't matter how many people get screwed! That's not true. Want me to tear this up? What does it matter? You're going to kill me anyway. Laney kidnapped Taylor. I had a feeling he would. And do you have a feeling where he might take her? Oh, I have some ideas. So tell us. Well, events must take their natural course. I can't interfere. What have you got to lose? My life's work. I must prevail. I think I've said enough. That night we were together, I haven't felt so close to anyone in a long time. I thought you should know. I wondered how long it would take you. What? Cheap psychology. Get his trust, keep him sweet. It's the truth. It's your job. Right now, you'd say or do anything to survive. No. Oh, I love you dear, that you're so great. I know what happens. I've seen it before, remember? Emerson brought us here and Emerson will force you to kill me. [music playing] No luck with Emerson? Can't find his weakness. It'll be there. You said guilt would weaken his self-esteem. Well, I see no sign of that! I mean this guy honestly believes he's going to go on forever. But what would it take to maintain that belief? More killings. And as he can't do them himself, he experiences them by proxy. Yeah, Taylor giving him the lock of hair. Exactly. He believes he's continuing through others. And in a strange way, he's right. Wait a minute. What? His weakness-- he needs people to believe in him. That's perfect. Thanks. Tell me about Laney. You relationship with him. My relationship? Teacher, pupil, master, student. Oh, he was so repressed. I set him free. And now you live on through him. No, the [inaudible] lives on. We simply say of it. He made you into a household name. He simply wrote what he saw. Got you your place in the history books. Where is this leading us? Just today's paper. He's taken over, Emerson, donning your mantle. He wouldn't. He's taking the credit for all the other murders. You know that's not true. Oh, I know. But what will the public think? What will the history books say? What are you waiting for? Why don't you kill me now? Everything at the appropriate time. You're waiting for Creegan to find me. What if he doesn't? He will. When you kill me, what will be the reason? Reason? I don't need a reason. I just have to be myself, my natural self. You're even beginning to sound like Emerson. I don't believe you want to be doing this, not the real you. What would you know about the real me? I know the you I saw that night. You thought you could manipulate him, control him. He's left you behind, Emerson. Stolen your image. Destroyed your reputation. Enough! This is as it should be. He was the one manipulating you. No. We had an agreement. If ever I was killed or arrested, he would continue my work. - It's his work now. - No. He told you about Foulds. He-- this is-- this is wrong. You're losing control, Emerson. Laney has the control. I have the control! Me! Me! So use it. He told me about driving the woman to suicide, said he would do the same to Foulds. I told him that wasn't enough, killing by proxy. You can't taste words. Where's Taylor? Did he leave a message? He said, I'm sending you a reward. It's the same message I sent him before I killed Emily Hawkins. He's recreating her death. The shack. Creegan? Don't hesitate this time. You think you know the real me? Do you know this part? (ON RADIO) Sometimes I have this daydream. It can happen at anytime. I can be walking down some street. (ON RADIO) What do you see? (ON RADIO) Women strangers-- I don't know them, but I watch them. (ON RADIO) And do they know they're being watched? (ON RADIO) Sometimes. (ON RADIO) And how do they react? (ON RADIO) Fear. They catch me watching, I see fear in their eyes. (ON RADIO) How does that make you feel? (ON RADIO) In control. And then the daydream comes, and I see myself following someone, hunting them down. (ON RADIO) Do you kill them, in your dream? (ON RADIO) Not to begin with, but lately, I'm not sure. (ON RADIO) How would you feel if I told you these were not dreams? (ON RADIO) Of course they're dreams. (ON RADIO) And what are dreams but alternate realities, a parallel dominion where you can be king? (ON RADIO) I haven't actually killed anyone. (ON RADIO) Well, how can you know-- what's imagined? What's real? (ON RADIO) What are you saying, that I've killed these women? (ON RADIO) How would you feel if you had? (ON RADIO) Complete The real me. Do you think this is a dream, David? What? All of this, us, we're just a dream to you? Nobody knows for sure what's real, what's imagined. This is real, David. These ropes are real, that knife's real, you and me. Shut up. Emerson was manipulating you. And he still is. No. My choice. I let him inside. I should go in. If he's recreating Emily's death, he needs you to be there. Maybe he won't kill her if it's me. I have to go in. You don't have to worry. I can do this. Another time. Laney's mine. First time I killed a man, it nearly destroyed me. Me or him, I had no choice. I remember every detail, the movement of every muscle on his face as he died. I felt this rush of life. Most alive I've ever felt. Enjoyed it? No. But I didn't feel guilty. Not then. No emotion. But later, when I had to watch him die over and over, then there was emotion-- too much. You felt that? Still do. How do you keep it [inaudible],, get rid of it? You don't. I'm still here. There is hope, David. I can help you find it. You'd help me? We can help each other. You really are special. You OK? Let's move. So what do we do? You cover the front. [music playing] What's wrong? Shit! David, no! - You don't want to do this. - Shut up! Don't kill him! He won't kill me. He won't! He doesn't want to kill me! Shut up! Put the knife down, David. Can't. I've been real. I have to. I have to. He's not Emerson, Creegan. What? He isn't Emerson! He doesn't want to kill me and he won't. Put the knife down, David. You don't have to do anything you don't want to do. Put the knife down and I'll help you. Put the gun down, Mark. Mark, put the gun away! You stupid bastard! What? He wasn't going to kill me! He had a bloody knife at your throat! You saw it, he had a knife. [music playing] [theme music]
