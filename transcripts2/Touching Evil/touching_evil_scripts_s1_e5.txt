 Who's that? Anyone in there? I am not ashamed. Why should I be ashamed? I did my duty. And this name keeps cropping up, Amathus. It's not Japanese. Culture I did what Amathus wants. She's lost. We're all lost, lost in the world. But Amathus found us.

 She's calling. And I follow the rules. I find the blood. I touched it. And she's not finished. There's blood to come, better blood. Game over. Lee Yamaguchi, 14 years old, from Kumagaya, 60 miles north of Tokyo. He was caught carrying a knife outside some stables 10 miles from his house. He attacked a horse, a stallion. Received a vertical slash from the knife on its left flank. Now, that was one of six horses attacked that night.

 In chronological order, the Kumagaya Stables came first. Then England, three separate incidents-- Gorse Farm, John Jerico Stables, Collinswood Stables. Then America, 130 miles outside of Lexington, Kentucky and finally Jamestown, North Dakota. Who the hell saw the connection? It's a miracle anyone noticed over that distance. I wish I could say it was a brilliant piece of observation, but it was software. A pattern recognition program sorts through isolated crimes. If there's a link, it's sent here. The six attacks didn't all happen at once. But technically, they all happened at the same time. As midnight of the 25th moved across the time zones, so each attack was triggered. It was coordinated. Has Yamaguchi said anything more about Amathus? Not a word. It's just a name over and over again. We've got a profile on Lee Yamaguchi. His parents sent him to an educational psychologist two years ago. He's a loner, an introvert with one obsession-- computers. Spends hours every day surfing the net. Well, even if it is an internet campaign, the attacks in this country have got a physical connection. Look how spread out these things are-- Japan to Dakota. But in this country, they're all within 40 miles of each other. So our three attackers are together. Must be. If Amathus isn't in the title, it could take forever to find. There's a million voices in cyberspace all chattering away. It's the edge of the world out there. Rivers, give it a rest. It's not me. - It was funny the first time. - It's not me. Shit. Is it Judith? Yeah. What? It's the baby. It's not due for another week. Um look. OK. If it isn't in the title, every website has a 50-word description. Amathus might be there. Nevermind that. Just go, you dumb sot. OK. Good luck. All the best. Oh, yeah. Cheers. Listen. Tell Enright I've gone. I'll come back if it's a false alarm. Jon, go to your wife and your kid. Take your leave, everything you're owed. And forget this place. All right? Lucky man. Yeah. My ex-wife's pregnant. Is that good news or bad news? I don't know. I'm still waiting. Kerry hasn't told me yet. I only found out by accident. But the funny thing is I like this, not knowing. I don't have to commit, act pleased, upset. Don't have to get involved. This unit's got the best early retirement deal I have ever seen because they know reach 50, we're burned out. We get too involved, all of us. I went to the funeral because I felt sorry for Burgess. That's all. Maybe we did push him, all of us. Did you go to the funeral of Ronald Hinks? No. Kerry will tell me in the end. Bet I'll get involved. I'll have no choice. I can wait, Mark. But it's not gonna go away. Is there any post? Well, good morning to you too. What's a matter? What? You want to dance with me? You want to dance with me? Then dance with me. Dance with me. I love you. I love you. We love you. 11 o'clock. I haven't seen Vince. There's no sign of him. Will you shut your face? He comes in on the same bus as me. [inaudible]... you don't talk-- not to me, not here. Do you understand? Yeah? Don't talk. That's the rules. Vince, what time is this? Come on. Shift. I'm not in till after 10:00. Your timetable's teletaped on the kitchen door. Monday, first lesson, design and technology. Well, come on. Shift. The Kumagaya police intercepted this addressed to Lee Yamaguchi. It contains an international money order the equivalent of 100 quid. It's Posted from London. The internet checks out. They found a website called Amathus. Rivers is downloading it now. Welcome to Amathus chapter five, in which Amathus is lost in the-- - Have you found the source? - Doing it now. It's one of the London service providers. They'll have the name and address. It's rooted in Greek mythology. Ariadne died in childbirth, and she was buried at Amathus. She finds herself wandering through the veil of misery. Hall of faces, all that Dungeons and Dragons bollocks. She's trying to find other lost souls. And to find them, she has to pass a test, the blood [inaudible]. And that test is a scarring of an ungulate. What's an ungulate when it's at home? A horse. Thank you, Oxbridge. So the players become Amathus in the real world, and they get rewarded with money. Have we got chapters one to four? They must have been deleted. I think we can expect a chapter six. To be continued. 11 o'clock. What the hell are you doing here? Congratulations. How's Judith? She's fine, fine. You look about 50, Dad. What was she? Seven pounds. Cheap for a baby. Rivers. Don't tell me Enright's called you in. We can handle this. It's nothing but a bunch of nutters. No, no. I asked if I could. There's no point in sitting at home. They're gonna keep her in for a few days. - Nothing wrong? - No, no. It's just routine. She's fine. Got it. The Amathus website was created by James Stoker, 22 Dunston Terrace, White City. Thank you. Well, that was easy. Game over. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Woo. Woo hoo. Don't. Amathus. There's been a reply. I talked to the main office. And he said the curtains have been drawn since he moved in 18 months back. Never seen anyone going in or coming out. Never heard of a James Stoker. Hey, Jon. Slow down. Jon, you shouldn't even be here. It's not as if we can charge this man with anything. Well, the sooner we get this done, the sooner we can get back to some proper work. Now go around the back. Amathus. Look upstairs. 22 Dunston Terrace, never heard of it. Well, it's definitely one of yours. We need some information on the tenant, James Stoker. Mind you, if I haven't heard of it, that's a good sign. It means he pays his rent on time. Less work for me. Hey, mind you, this is confidential. Have you got permission? Well, we could go away and get a warrant, which means we'll be back at what? 10 o'clock? So if you don't mind working late? Sod that. What was the name again? James Stoker. Well, what's it doing? That wasn't me. It's a virus. It's got to have been triggered by the address. That wasn't me. I didn't do nothing. Kreitman. Jonathan, are you in the house? There's nothing here. It's been empty For months. Get out of the house, Jonathan. He's waiting for us. It's part of the game. It's under control. Jon. Let's get him out of here. Come on. [inaudible] Spin him round. Come on out. Request urgent assistance, 22 Dunston Terrace. Ambulance and fire services. Officer down. Bastard. Bastard. It's all a fake-- the name, the address, everything. So we're legally entitled to shut the website down. And then we'll lose him. And he'll just disappear and start up under a different name. A couple of months, a couple of years, it'll happen again. Take that to forensics. Get it analyzed. Analyzed for what? How should I know? Oh, pleasure to see you, Jack. When did I get any coursework off you? Christmas? Five minutes, and I'm locking up. The domain's no good, I need a proper address. This year would be nice. How's Kreitman? Yeah, he'll be all right. It was a flash fire, burnt his hand. [inaudible] was a lot worse. He's in intensive care. That was the message that was sent to Amathus three minutes ago. They're asking for chapter six. Write quick as you can. I got the address. Fieldon Park Sixth Form College. Do you have personal logins? We don't, no. I unlock the network every Monday morning. And it's left until Friday night. We've had instability problems. Technically speaking, these machines are crap. Great. So we can't tell who's using which computer. You're going to have to introduce passwords straightaway. We need to get this right under control. Right. Start from scratch then. We're looking at a gang of three or three from a larger gang, preferably anyone taking computer studies or with access to this lot. That's all of them. Anyone can use these computers for any subject. How many students have you got? About 400. Any with a criminal record? About 400. Staff got access? Yes, if they want. Or we could narrow it down to those people without home computer. Not necessarily. Everything's traceable on the net. The players will know that. They'll use the school network to hide themselves. We're going to have to talk to them all. Can you arrange that? Not much to do around here. What do you get up to in the evenings? You asking me out? Hey, she's asking me out. What do you do? Hang out with your mates? Hey, she's asking about you. She wants the pair of us. Look. I'll tell you what. Tonight, outside our car park, 8 o'clock, - I'll show you what I can do. - Fine. You, 8 o'clock. Your mate, 8:01. What's that mean? Work it out. English, French, history, biology, IT, geography, that is a lot of A levels. It's [inaudible] Tough going. What's it to you? I bet you passed your exams first time. I did, yeah. It shows. And now you end up in the police, one box to another. What do you mean? Student, copper, husband, father-- one box after the other. Right, yeah. Do you know any of these three places? No. OK, Fiona. Do you know any of these places-- Gorse Farm, West Kingston, Collinswood Stables, [inaudible]... John Jericho Stables in [inaudible]?? Nope. Is that it? Come on. Try again. Got any more on that list? Just those three. You still here? All right, thanks. Name? [inaudible] Excuse me. Hang on a minute, mate. The injured hero. You got lucky. Jon's been in the back of beyond. 400 suspects. And guess where they were on Friday night? A rave. So they've all got an alibi. All off their heads. Can't remember a thing. He's dead. Allbery. The constable at Dunston Terrace died this afternoon. Shit. Sorry. It wasn't my fault. I didn't mean-- look. I'm sorry. All right? Whoa. We'll get him, James Stoker. Crack these kids, they'll lead us to him. We must have a profile of Stoker from what we've got. He built that bomb. - That narrows it down. - What? A fuel line in a [inaudible]? It's the sort of thing anybody can pick up on the net. - Doesn't mean he's clever. - OK. - Well, he knows his technology. - Whoa, whoa. It's 6 o'clock. Work is over. New regime. Give it a week. Have you had a good look at Jonathan Kreitman? He's just had a kid. He's still here. Me? I've got a party. Um I'd have invited you, but it might be a bit too wild. Oh, look. Present. Got you. Present. Got you. Louise, say thank you. Oh, I blame the parents. Didn't think you'd make it. How's things? They're fine. You? Yeah, fine. I think there's a beer left if the mums haven't drunk them all. They're worse than the kids. Three. Three. Three. Three. Three. Three. Three. Three. Three. Three. Three. There's all these students. They all looking the same. All 17-, 18-year-olds, all looking miserable and paranoid. They all sounded like me. Oh, you said it. Yeah, not anymore. In, out, in, out. You shake it all about. No more late nights. If it's not done by 6:00, tough. I'm even switching the mobile off when I leave the office. Good. About time. I could almost believe you. I am. I am. Honest, I am. Where's your phone? Go on. Show me. Liar. It's still on. Give us a chance, Kerry. How do you do this? Right leg in, your left leg out. Off. You're all mine. Should have done this years ago. Yeah. It's not too late, though, is it? This one's lost a piece of cake. And this one needs a loo. Oh, we've run out of cake, sweetheart. Your mum ate it all. Blame her. Three times, not four. Because you didn't do it, did you, Vince? I haven't got the nerve. So where did you get it from, hmm? Where did you get the blood? I did this. I gave you my own blood, Jack. I hurt no one but myself. That's no good. That's not in the rules. Shut up, you. - Anyone could do that. - That's. Shut up. Man, if you'd have said. If you'd have come and told us, then maybe we would have understood. Yeah. How? We're not supposed to meet up. That's the rules. I gave you Amathus. I gave you the reward. And all the time, you were lying. You can't come back from this. You're lost. I don't wanna come back. I've had enough. I'm getting out. I'm going away from you, from that house. Right into the crowd. Poor Vince, losing himself in the crowd. Parents, teachers, employees, they look at the crowd. And they label them. They put them in nice little boxes. And do you know why? So they can know them, to control. No one knows us. No one knows. We are beyond control, Vince. We're invisible. But we're not. The police are here, Jack. They're here. They know nothing, nothing. Not until one of us tells. You could point us out. Then we are a part of the crowd. We're nothing. We go back to being nothing. I'm not going back to that. I'm never going back. Amathus says the best should move on. Those that fail just get left behind. Yeah. Well, Amathus isn't here. Do you know what I mean? Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Woo hoo. Woo. Woo. For God's sake. What are you doing there? It's a moth. It's Cyril, isn't it? How'd you know that? I saw it in the clouds. Did you? It's different today. It's all red and green. Did you see it? Red and green and red? How did you get in here? Creegan. He's gone to get me a Pepsi. Has he got lots of Cyrils tucked away, or are you the only friend he's got? There's you. I don't know about that. I think I'm just a colleague. There's you. You only had this, health drink. It's pop. Morning, Inspector Taylor. Good party? It was interesting. Don't tell me. My turn? Cyril, you're gonna have to bugger off. Enright wants us back in the field in Cross. What for? Kid's gone missing, Vince Wilson. It's all right. I've said it now, red and green. She's seen it too, red and green. Oy, what's this rubbish? Orders from the police. From now on, you need an individual password. And my name's Miss Jackson, not oy. It's porn. That's what they're after, porn. I'll never find it. It's all a con. Enright's told you once. Go home. I'll come with you. It's all waiting at home. The cops and the toys and the rubbish, it's all just waiting till they're home. I'd rather be doing something just till they're home. We've lost Amathus. 2 o'clock. What do you mean? Shove off. How can we lose her? She's sending chapter six today. Mo, tell me. They've put on passwords. We try and read it, they'll know it's us. So what are we gonna do? 2 o'clock, you dull little twat. 2 o'clock. Now piss off. I'll take this lot back to [inaudible] Road, see what I can resurrect. You go with Creegan. You know what they're like. Don't tell you a thing. He goes out some nights, comes back drunk. I don't know who he's with. Did he mention anyone at all? You think he's dead, don't you? All this. You think he's dead. Over here, sir. Clothes belonged to Vince. His mother's come up with a name as well, Mo, girl he used to mention. That's all she knows. No surname. They've analyzed the envelope sent to Lee Yamaguchi. The address panel's impregnated with LSD. Welcome to Amathus chapter six, in which the web of deception-- Chapter six, sir. Stoker's in there right now. What country is he in? It's coming through the London service provider, but he could be anywhere in the world. We're tracing it. It's British mainland, sir. And he's using a laptop and a mobile phone. It's going to take a while to get a fix. It's gone down, sir. - We couldn't trace it. - Look. The players are waiting for chapter six. They must know when Stoker delivers. They can't use the school computers. If they go somewhere else, we can trace it. It's describing something called the long walk, at the end of which there's a final test, a hominid, a human being. What's the instruction? Scar them? No. It says kill. What have we got? No student by the name of Mo or Maureen. Anyone dealing in dope or speed, leave them. It's specifically acid, LSD. There was one, but it wasn't proved. That's your man. Someone's opened up Amathus, one of the players. Name's Jack McCaffrey. Teaches [inaudible] at midday. Lives at the Plow Public House, charter house yard about 10 miles away. School disco last summer, boy named Garreth Constantino started hallucinating. Claims Jack spiked his drink with acid. No charges, nothing proven. Excuse me. Excuse me. Frank just said there is a girl called Mo, Fiona Morrison. - It's her surname. - All right. - Where is she now? - Don't know. Could be in lessons. I'll find her. With good identification, the name's Jack-- McCaffrey, the [inaudible] Yeah. Thanks, Mark. Tell me something new. Police. We're looking for Jack McCaffrey. Where is he? Something real, Craig. Someone. We can walk into this world and change it. Leave it changed forever. I mean they all think that we're nothing. I'd rather be nothing. Oh, yeah? You wanna go back home? Your father's dead, Craig. Your mother wants you sitting there, a copy of him. That's all they want of us-- copies, growing old and dying and... Take the walk, Craig. Do something that no one has ever done before. 20 stars for the journey, carrying the sword. Then, find the hominid and kill. But who? It's not like a horse. Who am I supposed to find? You'll know them when you see them. You'll know them when you see them. One of the crowd, Craig, a face in the crowd. What if I can't? You'll do it. Come on. Come on. [inaudible] [inaudible] Buckingham Palace. Tower of London. Off with his head. Woo. Yeah. Yee haw. All units, suspects in blue Granada estate, heading north on A317. They won't go through with it. They're just kids. Jack's 17. 17's a kid. He's just a kid. Ah, shit. I hit this yesterday. Three sets of lights before they turn off. Hit this one on red, they're all red. I can beat them. Shit. OK. You don't have to prove anything. Let's just get there in one piece, all right? They're just kids, Creegan. Whatever they've become, we made them. If they're clever, we made them clever. And if their heads are full of shit, we made them full of shit. Because who have they got? Who have they got except us? That's our job, the only job that counts, carving out a world that they can live in. Everything we do is for them. And we've got to be fast. We've got to stay ahead. Jonathan, please slow down. Too fast for you, Creegan? We've got to be fast. I'm telling you to slow down. We've gotta be fast, or we're letting them down. Blood vision, you heard of that? You go so fast the blood comes up over your eyes. Everything's red. [inaudible] Krietman, stop the bloody car. Yes, yes. What are you playing at, man? It was oxygen, they said. I don't know. They told me, and I'm listening. But it's not going in. Something to do with oxygen, the birth. Starved of oxygen in the head, damaged in the head. Oh, she's breathing. She's living. But she's just meat, a sack of meat. Hasn't even got the sense to die. I made that. There's no one else's fault. It's mine. And she'll never know all the things I've done to keep her safe when all she's got is a head full of shit. I did it for her, Ronald Hinks. I killed him to make her safe. I thought I was better than him. I couldn't understand a man who wanted children dead. I do now. You'll know them when you see them. You'll know them when you see them.
