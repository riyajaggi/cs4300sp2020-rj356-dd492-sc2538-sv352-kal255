 Previously on AMC's Low Winter Sun... If you go looking for her, it's only gonna blow back on us. I'm not going back to Detroit. Where have you been? Half the department's been looking for you. Michael? No, no, no, no! You thought you were better at this than me. He's got you in frames with Skelos and Brendan. One white guy, one black guy. What you described... is that what you saw? Where is the coke? I'm on Billy's murder, and it's not making sense.

 Well, who is he? Hey. Hey, Sean. I guess my alarm didn't go off. Egg sandwich. Oh, room service. Nice. You need a dentist. Nah, it's gonna fall out on its own. I'm kinda thirsty, though. Why don't you sit down? Stay a while. Not today. You okay? You might not see me for a few days. Looks like we got a break in the case.

 Well, that's cool. Yeah, go fight crime. Hey, hot sauce next time, okay? Your turn. Mm. We live in Florida. No crew. Just us. We have jobs. Nine-to-five jobs. Uh... but we go to the beach every weekend. Drink rum. Body surf. Pay taxes. Play tennis with friends who play tennis. I hate us. All right, all right. I'm sorry to do this to you, Maya, but I got a warrant to search the house. You gotta be kidding me, Frank. You don't have enough real problems to deal with? This guy look familiar? No, never seen him. Not a reason to tear up my house. Come on. I'm bringing you in for questioning. Why? I already answered your questions. I don't know that guy. If you have anything to say, you say it now. Talk to him here. I know what happens downtown-- what you guys do. Don't worry, I'll take care of him. Coke in here. You want cuffs on her, sir? No. Come on. I know you can hear me. Get me a damn-- I want a lawyer! Forget her. We focus on this prick. He is the answer to our prayers. Started out doing small-time hustles. Wound up a killer. - Yeah. - World won't sleep any less if he goes down for all this. Won't work unless we nail him for Hobson. We gotta make that stick. He said Boyd already linked him to Brendan. Yeah, but he won't crack on murders he didn't do. It's gotta be Hobson first. - This the perp? - Yeah, Damon Callis. You got a whole case of circumstantial at this point. How you wanna work it? We use what we have. We get him to confess to the shooting. And then we start working him for Brendan and Bobek. - What about her? - I'll talk to her. She started yelling for a lawyer a few minutes ago. You're not worried Damon will ask for one? No, his ego's too jacked up. Frank, you take him. Make this a good day in the D. My day's going pretty good. How's yours? You want a coffee? Smoke? Your mom? Hilarious. You know, I have been doing this for a very long time. You know what I found? People usually want to tell me the truth. Yeah, they come in here, after a little push back, they talk. I couldn't stop them if I tried. You know what they do then? They fall asleep. They sleep like babies. I don't have anything to talk about. We both know that's not true. The truth is you killed Billy Hobson, stole his coke and left his body for the dogs. You're gonna need a lawyer. It's a good thing Maya's screaming for one. She's a clever woman. I don't know what she's doing with you. We've got security camera footage. We got people crawling out from under rocks to incriminate you. We got enough in here to put you away for life. And some change. I know what you're trying to pin on me. McCann and that chopped-up loser, and I didn't do any of it. And you're probably coming after me because Maya's married to me now instead of your ex-partner. He was pretty tweaked out last time I saw him. Yeah, Sean's seen better days. At least, he's had better days. You should've seen him and Maya. Maya, she could really turn heads. Not so much since she married you. She looks beat now. Your ex remarried. She went for brains this time. A professor, right? Yeah, Maya and her, they talk all the time. She's like, "Frank who?" Up. I gotta take a piss. I don't have to take a piss. I can't leave you in here on your own. Joe. Yeah? Stay down. Still pissing blood? Really? No, no, no. No. No! No! ♪ I ain't no quitter ♪ ♪ I'm in for a pound ♪ ♪ Ain't nobody ♪ ♪ Gonna hold me down ♪ ♪ Hustlin' in the Motor City ♪ ♪ Hustlin', just tryin' to get down ♪ ♪ Down, down, down. ♪ Sync and corrections by n17t01 www.addic7ed.com Small-time scrapper gets ambitious, decides to smoke a plug. Steal his dope. Thinks no one will put it together. He's talking about you. Just so you know. You killed Billy Hobson. Sooner you admit that, the better. Sooner you can dump those other murders on me? The murders that you committed. Hobson's coke disappeared at exactly the same time you started moving big weight out of... where was that pig? Brush Park. More in here. Ballistics. Footprints. Fingerprints. Hair. You left a lot of yourself in that house. Because you did it. Where's the rest of Callis' crew? Uniforms are walking the men now. We're still missing one, though. Which one? Michael Drake. The one on the security tape with Callis. Find him. You know it didn't sit right with me, rolling up on you at home. I want a lawyer. No need. No charges against you. What about the coke? I told them to keep you out of it. You're good. Damon's not so lucky. Good thing you asked for a lawyer. Doesn't mean he's guilty. He killed that slinger. You know that? His car was spotted outside the trap house where Billy Hobson was killed. Took this from a security tape near the murder site. If he comes clean now, it'll help him with sentencing. That guy... - Michael, talk to him? - Not yet. I don't know any details... but he's Damon's friend from way back. Damon's been good to him, you know? But he has a habit. Started acting crazy around the time of the murder. Took off a few days ago. Haven't seen him since. Any idea why? He could have done it. He could have shot that dealer. So girl just threw one hell of a Hail Mary for her man. All of it bullshit. We need the rest of the crew. Steven and Gus are in boxes now. What about Michael? Still no luck. Might not matter as long as we got the other two. He was in the photo, he's involved. If he's involved, I want his ass brought in. Damon makes more sense. He's the one with the rap sheet. Michael's an accessory at best. Light a fire under all of 'em. See if anybody backs Maya's story. Dani, take the guy with the hand. Joe, you take the other one. Frank, stay on Damon. Work the Michael angle. Work it enough to keep Dawson happy, then steer it back to Damon. You don't have to tell me twice. Nice oven mitt. There a story behind it? Nope. 'Cause I'll listen. I wanna hear whatever you have to say. There's nothing to say. I didn't do anything. Just an accident. Actually, you've done a lot, Gus. Got busted four years ago with some rock. Still on parole. Could bite you in the ass. Or you could talk to me. It all goes away. Michael Drake, your right-hand man. I'm getting hungry. What's the chance of me getting some food in here? Zero. Michael, where is he? Free man. He can go where he wants. How long since you last saw him? I don't know. You don't know how long it is since you last saw your best friend? Yeah. What? Yeah, I got it. Geddes, get where you're supposed to be. Uh-huh. - Wanna know where he is. - How would I know? Photos from a store by the trap house where Billy Hobson was killed. Man, no one here's doing anything but making change. Why you have it? Collect pictures of guys? Ha. One of them's in custody down the hall. The other one's missing. You know why? Maya's been a lot of help. She likes talking to cops. Oh, really? Did you kick her too? She says Michael has a habit. She said that? Said he took off a couple of days after the murder. Which makes me think. He knows you killed Hobson. Maybe that's why he ran away, to protect you. Yeah. He took off, but not because of me. He, uh... he heard Hobson was holding. He talked about it while we were out driving that day. Maybe he went to the trap for the coke. I don't know. Maybe he did it. Bullshit. Which one killed Hobson? - Neither. - One of them did it. Which one of them killed Billy Hobson? Neither. Michael disappeared shortly after the murder. Damon started dealing. You don't know dick. I know how to make one call to your PO and you're back in Jackson. Which one did it, Gus? You'll forget about my parole and everything? Damon... he didn't do it. I wasn't there, but, uh... I think Michael killed that rocker. We called Michael's family. They say they haven't seen him. Man, just tell me where he is that I can forget I ever saw your white ass. Whoa, man, you think Michael popped that dealer? Your whole crew is saying he did it. Evidence supports it. You just have to agree-- Michael did it. No way, that ain't right. He didn't do it, man. I swear on my mom. On my sister. You're gonna go against your whole crew? I'm saying... you got two guys in that picture. And Michael didn't do it. Michael never killed anybody, man. That's the truth. What the hell are you doing, huh? Yeah, I'm not surprised those clowns couldn't agree on the murderer. Michael's a smoke screen. We could get an indictment on Damon with what we have now. Michael took off after the murder and innocent people don't run, LT. This is not the debate club. We need a confession out of Damon, since he's the only suspect we actually have in custody. Work him together fast, before he figures out you lied about the wife calling him a lawyer. Mood's looking up around here. Heard you might have McCann's killer in there. We're gonna hand you a real solid case. Be great to close it today. Press'll love it. Hell, I'd love it. Meaning, you two will be heroes when I put you on the stand in the Lady Belle trial. Yeah, gentlemen, that's an APA's dream. It's good to know. Today. Michael killed Hobson, got scared, took off. I told you all that. Well, maybe we're slow. Fill in the blanks. How'd it go down? I don't know. I wasn't there. Then tell us how you think it went down. Day of the shooting, Michael was flying. You know the exact day? That day, he had been up all night doing coke. And you know this how? You with him all night? Most of it. He was crawling out of his skin. He couldn't sit still. So we went for a drive. He stopped at that store. Maybe he knew it was by the trap. That's where he got the idea from. I don't know. I drove us back to the bar. You didn't see Hobson? No. Michael asked to borrow my car. Went for a drive. I didn't see him for a few hours. He was really messed up. And you think he stole the coke. Yeah. - He didn't share it with you? - I guess not. Even though we have witnesses who say a few days later, you were dealing big for the first time in your life! No, they're lying. You know what? This conversation makes me really wanna piss. What's that? You too? Let's go. Hey... You're so stupid, your lies don't even make sense. If you really had anything on me, we wouldn't be in here. You forget about this morning? Huh? Coke at your house? Maya already has one strike. Possession. Judge won't do her any favors. You don't confess to the murder of Hobson, she goes away for a very long time and doesn't get to see her kids. Doesn't see 'em now. There will come a time when she wants them back, and if she's behind bars, it'll kill her. Now I'm fine with that if you are. Get out. We had a very interesting conversation about his wife. I talk, Maya walks. I got something that'll make you forget about Hobson. I want to cut a deal, though. Hey, hey, hey! Hey! You killed my partner. Ain't no deal for you! Okay? Ain't no deal for you! Get out! Get me a lawyer. Now! I'd shove your head in the toilet if it would do any good. What kind of jackass performance was that? We needed him to make a confession, not a deal. Some of us might have wanted to hear what he had to say. You violated every one of his rights and we still got nothing. Oh, you gonna pull the rule book out now? The prosecutor finds out about this, it could cost us Hobson. And you know trying to pin those other two murders on him was a mistake. You, I don't want to see your face for two weeks. Effective immediately. Punk killed my partner. Punk might've played you. Get out. And I worked my ass off on Hobson. No support from the department. Damon gets hauled in. Dawson has you take him, even though I'm the lead. And then when he's about to give us something, Joe blows it, gets a slap on the wrist. I went back to LeFevre. You did what? He said he felt manipulated when he gave his statement. Granted, he's not a gem, but... No. We pushed for clarity. No one manipulated anything. Just wasn't my best interview, that's all. Right when you and Katia split, wasn't it? Yeah, that's no excuse. - Dani, we should talk about what happened. - Here we go. I just don't want you to think I want it to be only the once. I... that's not why I showed up. We're big kids. Frank, it's cool. If it was once, if it was more than once, neither one of us needs more pressure in our lives. I mean it. I need to ask you something. Sure. You think Joe might've been involved in Brendan's murder? Joe's a piece of garbage, he's not a killer. He lied to me, to the deputy mayor, about re-interviewing LeFevre. Never did it. Why lie if he doesn't have something to hide? Yo, it's about time you got here. Damn. What's wrong? You look like hell. Yeah, I got a tooth thing going on. But I'm not using, so that's good. Why you opening so late, anyway? Hmm? I'm parched. Where's douche Romeo? It's a long story. I hope it involves you leaving him. I was at DPD all day. Cops showed up at the house this morning with a warrant. Damon's still down there. Well, call Frank. He'd pull some strings. Hell, he brought me breakfast. He's the asshole that hauled us in. You know he came in here a few weeks ago. Acting like a friend. I trusted him. Baby, he's a cop. They arrest Damon, or they just holding him? Arrest. Look at us. Just sitting together. It's special circumstances. Don't get used to it. When did the guest list expand to five is what I want to know. Why? Because I'm your dad is why. No, you're still gonna have to clean up after. You cannot think that Grandma Violet and me are gonna do that. Yes, yeah, yeah. I got it. Hamburgers, uh, hot dogs, pop, chips. I got it. Well, I got one more stop. I'll be home soon. Thank you for coming here. My son has practice. See? Everyone here is crazy for this sport. It eludes me. You need to be worrying about your ass 'cause we nearly went down today. If you called an hour later, Callis would have talked about you and about Brendan. I think about Brendan, don't you? Who would have wanted him dead? Man, forget him. I put my neck on the line today. I put my job on the line. Only a matter of time before Callis opens his mouth. You understand that, right? I'll handle it when it's prudent. Too many people firing too many guns. Too many police. You want to stay out of prison? He needs to disappear, fast. And I don't want to deal with it this time. So if you do it, make sure it's not in Detroit. Hell... make sure it's on the Moon. Bar looks good. Yeah, your gramps would be proud to see you keep it in the family. You done all right. Got yourself cleaned up. That's good. Aw, hell. Uh... Damn it. God! You know, it could be worse.

Asshole. _ _ _ _ _ Okay. Good night. Mom... I love you too. Okay. This is my house. My personal space. Off-limits. I heard Joe Geddes was a bit off today. Might have cost you the case. I know you're not here for the party. Which is a good thing 'cause we've already run out of burgers. Damn, those girls can eat. Shut up. Dad, I'm-- Oh, hey, Mr. Agnew. What are you doing? Visiting. Um, CC dropped her earring in the toilet. Then CC can fish it out, huh? Of course. I'm not leaving till I get some answers. I figure. Not here. Stop the boat. Stop it. Gotta get out here for privacy. Dignity. Now my home ain't my castle anymore. Full of girl stuff and mom stuff-- smells of lotion. I don't give a rat's ass. We agreed. Callis was perfect. I could see the end of this. We'd be done. We're murderers, Frank. Ain't no end to that. He knows. He knows what Brendan did for Skelos. Covering up the murders. Getting them declared suicides. He doesn't know you're involved. And you do? What, Brendan whispered to you from beyond the grave? Boyd... he hasn't put it together yet, but he's close. That prick... is just giving me a headache. I went back, checked your clearances with Brendan. It's all there. You know how much this boat cost? 32 grand. Cash. Worth every penny. Here. Start talking. You wanna know how we got here? Why I needed your help to kill my own partner? Here it is, Frank. I am a weak man. You see that river? That's me. Always looking for the path of least resistance. For the easy way around this city. Integrity? Honesty? They don't buy you a boat. They just make things harder. I don't know if you still believe in God. I hope you do. 'Cause I hope he can see you sold your soul for a couple of bucks. Me and God? We're tight. 'Cause he knows I'm weak. He made me this way. Man, I feel Him out here. Pressing down on the water. That face. Those eyes. Watching. And I'll tell you this, that dude don't blink. You know, Brendan hated you. He hated your strength. But he knew how to pull a weak man in, and before you know it, you're working for the Greek. How'd you get the ME to roll? MEs get paid worse than we do. They'll check the wrong box for a hundred bucks. All those families that didn't get justice. You lied to them all. Yeah, it sticks in your craw for a while. And then... then it just goes away. You keep telling yourself that. You find distractions. Remember that house Brendan was buying? He needed real money for that, so he took over the killings from Skelos. And if you're weak like me, you just become the cleanup guy. Don't act like you never had a choice. You had a choice every day. I made a deal with the devil! And he doesn't let you walk away. Brendan had to die. He had to and the world is a better place without him. And I would say that to his mama's face if he had a mama. DPD is sick! Through and through. Not everyone. Give me the name of a clean cop. And you can take your name off that list. Dani. She's good. Aha. Aha. And you tap that yet? Oh, you did. She polished your badge. She thinks you might've killed Brendan. Just me? Oh, that is good. She's gonna figure it out. Yeah, I'll worry about that another time. I got another problem. What were you doing in Chicago? The whole department's talking about it. I heard that you were disappointed. I'm sure that's a euphemism. Doesn't mean I want to talk to you. You don't have to. But I wanted to give you the chance. Discreetly. Geddes screwed you over. He should be held accountable. You deserve answers. You know that, right? Do you think what he did was deliberate? That he had a motive? I don't know. He just started... working a different agenda. Like he needed to get Callis out of there. What he's done could taint everyone. Even the good cops. You need to protect your future. If you know anything. I think... I think Joe might have killed Brendan. What about Frank? He was with Geddes when they took LeFevre's statement. No, Frank's clean. Admits he's been off his game. It's just personal stuff. Like ex-wife problems and midlife crisis problems? Problems with that girlfriend, the Eastern European? He mentioned her. Really? Are they still together? I don't know. You'll have to talk to him about that. He's a great detective. So are you. I suggest you pay closer attention to his work. Seems like he hasn't been making good decisions lately. You're wrong about Frank. And never tell me what to pay attention to again. You need to go. I respect that. Bonsoir. You disappear for more than a day, and you think I'm just gonna let that slide? You remember when I called you? I had a friend trace your cell. Yeah. Did you find her, Frank? I looked. Windsor, Detroit. Yeah, Chicago. She's gone. No one knows where she is. She is the only one who can bring us down and she's not meant to be found. I let her live once. You know you destroyed her. She was innocent. She was worth saving. And now I can't. We need to let Brendan's investigation go cold like I wanted. DPD got a taste of blood today. They're not gonna settle for cold now. That noose around your neck, Frank, is gonna get tighter and tighter. You need a plan. I got one. I'm gonna grab my kid and take this boat to Canada. Or maybe you and me just need to kill each other right now. Do you have a plan, Frank? Yeah. You're gonna take me back to shore. I can't do that. We need to agree on what we're gonna do. Take me back. I said no. Move. We're taking on water. Don't know why you wanted me to do that. Didn't make me feel any better. You get any penance? Bunch of Hail Marys. Say it in the car. It's all right. Thought you'd never get out. The PD didn't do a damn thing. They must've done something. No, Skelos sent his own lawyer. Maybe you're back on his good side? He wasn't doing it to be nice. He wants me where he can get me. On the street. In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. It's been 18 years since my last confession. I lied. Stole. Cheated. I didn't do right by the mother of my kid. I was a coward. Then... Take your time. I became a cop. I believe the witness may have actually seen Geddes and Agnew by the river. That they may have misled said witness, tried to railroad someone named Callis and warped the investigation to cover their tracks. I think it's possible they may have been involved in McCann's death. And my CI, Anton Bobek. You believe a lot of things about cops, Lieutenant. That's why you're IA. You know what I have on Geddes and McCann. I think things went south for them. Geddes needed McCann dead. Roped in Agnew. Now they're scrambling to save their hides. This is all conjecture. Agnew disappeared for 36 hours a few days ago. No explanation. I want them both tailed. I want a warrant for surveillance. I get Geddes, but... Agnew has an impeccable record. Why would he do this? There was a girl.
