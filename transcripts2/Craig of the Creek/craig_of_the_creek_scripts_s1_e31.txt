 Sorry for screaming, sir. We were expecting Kelsey. Yeah, you're usually not here. I work, and I'm working from home today. Kelsey's upstairs. Whoa, hey! Shoes, jackets. You're soaking wet. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. ♪♪ [ Sighs ] Guess we're not goin' in the creek today. Well, at least now you guys get to stay for dinner. Hey, Mortimer, I think you've spent enough time on that sock.

 Wow, Kelsey, you've got a whole library here. Where'd you get all these books? Most of them used to belong to my mom before she passed. But my dad's helped me add to the collection. Ooh, ooh! This was my mom's favorite. She used to read it to me before bedtime. "Say Good Knight"! Ugh. Mr. Bern: Aah! Dad, you okay?! Kelsey, quick, I need towels! Not wash cloths -- towels, but not the good ones! [ Grunting ] [ Man groans ] I should've fixed that stinking skylight last spring. My files are all wet. Dad? You okay? Me and, ironically, this photo of us on The Drencher will be fine, but dinner -- that's another story. Take a knee. Kelsey, my brave knight, I have to fix this crack in our mighty castle's... drywall. I'm afraid I must task you with a quest. I need you to order dinner. It would be my honor, Father. Thanks, sweet pea. Here, take this 20 pence. And please, choose tastefully. Whoa. Whoa. I know you three can handle the task. [ British accent ] I will not fail you, Father. Wait, so your dad wants us to order dinner alone? That's kind of an adult thing, and, I mean, we're kids. [ Normal voice ] Ah-ah-ah. Correction. We're bigkids. I'm 8, you're 9, JP's tall. We can handle this. Behold! The sacred drawer of menus. Bow to the drawer. Bow. Bow to the drawer. ♪♪ We must choose between the five holy realms of sustenance within a five-mile delivery radius, and we got to pick quick because I think some of these places close soon. Okay, uh, what do you feel like eatin', Craig? I don't really care. I'm just hungry. Ooh! Wings. Nah, too greasy. Okay. Uh, can't go wrong with a sandwich. Uh, we can make sandwiches any time. Okay. Uh, pizza! Everybody loves pizza. Yeah, but I just had pizza with my family last night, so... I thought you said you didn't care. Listen, how about I Larb Thai? It's Thai food. My dad and I order from here all the time. We have to order Khua kling lamb for my dad. It's super spicy, and he makes the funniest face when he eats it. Wait, we'recalling them? Like, wehave to talk to unfamiliar adults over the phone? Isn't there a way to, like, order online? Nah, this place doesn't have a website. We got to call. I-I don't think they're gonna take an order from three kids. Nobody takes orders from kids. But what if we don't sound like kids? [ Grunts ] Remind me why we're doing this. Uh, it helps me get into character. Ooh, it's ringing. [ Clears throat ] [ Deep voice ] Good evening, ma'am. I require an order of pad see ew with chicken, your finest larb, and the Khua kling lamb. And a side of rice. Children, please, I'm on the phone. And a side of rice. And I need it delivered. Oh, dear. Guys, their delivery driver is stuck in the storm, and they can only do takeout. Abort! Abort! Abort! [ Groans, grunts ] Uh, takeout's fine. Bye. I love you. [ Groans ] Takeout is fine? It's raining whales outside! [ Normal voice ] I know! I panicked. You weren't there, Craig! Great, what do we do now? We pick it up ourselves. My dad is counting on us. He has trusted us with this quest, and I won't accept failure no matter how many pits cross our path. Will your dad even let us? Hey, Dad! We're gonna go get the food! Mr. Bern: Okay! Bring your pepper spray and a Taser! I don't have those! Just be careful, then! ♪♪ Here, Craig, take the money for safe keeping. Sorry, buddy, you'll have to sit this one out. [ British accent ] Protect Father while I'm gone. Mwah! [ Thunder rumbles ] [ Normal voice ] Now, it's time to pick up our food. This way. We'll head up here and go under the Falling Branch Tree. [ Gasps ] Ha! Up to your same tricks, I see, Falling Branch Tree. [ Applause ] This way. Over there. Whoa! Aah! ♪♪ Are you sure Mudslide Mountain's the fastest way down? Positive. ♪♪ Aah! JP! Whoa! [ British accent ] Squire! Farewell, friends! ♪♪ [ Normal voice ] Remember, this is Splash Alley, so be weary of -- [ Horn honks ]Car! Trash-lid shields up! [ Horn honks ] How much longer now?It's straight down the street. You see it?I think so. Hey, JP, do you mind moving over a bit? Sure thing. Aah! JP! Oh, I see it. My booties are all wet thanks to that puddle. That was no puddle. It was at least three ankles below sea level. [ British accent ] Can you walk, squire? I guess I can. I'll just have to deal with my wet socks the whole time. Fear not, because I always keep an extra pair of dry socks on me -- sandwich-bag protected. [ Gasps ] [ Normal voice ] The money! ♪♪ What -- What do we do? We must cross the street. Cross it? That street's got like 50 lanes. Oh, why'd your dad think we could handle this? Hey! Pull it together. My dad didn't think we could do it. He knew we could do it. Now, take my hand. Oh, mighty crosswalk, we ask for your guidance. Please grant us safe passage. ♪♪ Wow! Ah! Ha! Got it! Man, you were right. We canhandle this. Guys, I don't want to ruin the moment, but the little walky guy turned into a hand. The spell's wearing off! Move it! [ All shouting ] Aah! ♪♪ Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! [ Bell rings ] Here we are. Sorry, pick-up only. Our driver's caught in the rain. No, we don't have a jet ski. Yes, we tried calling the jet-ski place. They don't deliver, either. [ Sighs ] Anyway, how may I help...you? I'm here for pick-up. Name. JP: [ Deep voice ] Pokoly. Neil Pokoly. Oh, yeah, the kids pretending to be adults. That'll be $19.29. Keep the change. Here you go. ♪♪ Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. We really got the food. It's warm. Feel it. Wow, it is. Let's... Set... The table. JP, there's some cups hanging over there on the hooks. Craig, check the dishwasher for plates. ♪♪ And don't forget my chalice! ♪♪ This is so fun. Reminds me of this one time I went to Texas to go see my grandma who really isn't my grandma. Kelsey: Where's the rice? Where's the rice?! Aah! How could you forget the rice? My palate -- I'll never taste [Echoing] again. [ Screams ] They forgot to give us our rice! My dad can't eat his Khua kling lamb without rice to soak up the extra spice. [ Sighs ] I can't believe after all the trials we faced, we still failed the quest. Hmm. All hope is not lost yet. We can make our own rice. I've never cooked rice before, though. Do you think we can do that? [ Scoffs ] Are you kidding? We can totally do that. Yeah, look at all we've done today. We can definitely handle this. ♪♪ Okay, the pot is now waterized. Okay, now we got to cover it and bring the water to a boil. I got a lid. Hmm. What's wrong? We're kids. We're not allowed to turn on the stove. Rats. You're right. Hey, look, it turned itself on. Okay, we have to wait for the water to start boiling, so let's finish setting up the table. ♪♪ The rice is ready! ♪♪ [ All groan ] Hmm? Oh! My eyes are melting from the light! Dad! Wow, what a bountiful spread. Fair knight, once again, you have shown this old man, who is not that old, the depth of your ability and skill. Thank you. I assure you, I could not have done it if it weren't for my trusted companions. They really saved the day by making the rice. Uh, i-it was nothing. Gentlemen, although your initial inability to take off your wet shoes revealed your ignorance, this meal has proven you are both somewhat competent children. Thank you. Oh. Oh. Smile over. So, shall we digeth in? Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Ooh! Spicy! Kelsey: Dad, the rice! Mr. Bern: The rice. Ahh.
