 ♪♪
 Please, please, please don't do this, Mom!
 I'll do anything! Uh, I'll clean the house.
 I'll wash the car and file your taxes.
 Just please don't leave Bernard in charge!
 I don't have time to argue about this, baby.
 Sorry, my guy, but we've got to get to the concert.
 ♪ It's the Jelly reunion tour ♪
 They've been broken up for 15 years,
 and there's a good chance
 they'll break up before the end of the night,
 so we got to get there on time!
 But I don't need Bernard.
 I'm totally capable of taking care of myself.
 I'm not like Jessica.
 I can take care of myself!
 I tie my own shoes, I go to the bathroom by myself,
 I know which bus to take home.
 When Michael Finch teases me about my height,
 I do not give him the satisfaction!
 Thatta girl!
 Are you sure you two are gonna be all right
 babysitting tonight?
 We'll be fine, Mrs. Williams!
 My friends and I are the most professional sitters
 you'll find this side of Herkleton.
 We're unionized.
 Do you see why I love this woman?
 This is gonna be so great, Alexis.
 All right, now, don't get ahead of yourself, my man.
 [ Cellphone buzzes ]
 Oh, shoot! We got to get going
 or we're gonna miss the opening act --
 Big Pocket Hank.
 He's a hip-prop comedian.
 He freestyles about what's in his pockets.
 [ Sighs ] It's a lot of songs about keys and loose change.
 Man just needs to get a wallet.
 Bye, sweetie.
 Get along with your brother, now.
 That means you, too, Bernard.
 Well, at least it's pizza night.
 Sorry, little brother.
 There's been a change in the menu.
 Tonight, we're having risotto al cavolfiore.
 What?! But it's Friday!
 Friday is always pizza night!
 Well, Mom put me in charge,
 and Alexis and I are more than capable of cooking dinner.
 We got the recipe from celebrity chef couple Ash and Ajan!
 Bernard thought it'd make a great couple activity.
 Like Ash and Ajan always say,
 "A chef can make a meal..."
 "But two chefs can make magic."
 How dare you ruin the sanctity of pizza night!
 We will not stand for this blasphemy.
 Mm-hmm!
 Jessica! We could use some extra hands in the kitchen.
 Would you like to come help?
 [ Gasps ] Yay!
 This is mutiny!
 I'm so excited about making this dish, Bernard!
 It's gonna be so umami.
 Yeah! It's gonna have all the umami!
 And this prosciutto is going to add some great flavor text.
 Eugh. What's the matter?
 You don't like prosciutto? Pbht!
 Oh, come on, Craig, don't you want to be
 a supportive little brother and try Bernard's dish tonight?
 No.
 You know, you're lucky anyone's here to feed you at all.
 If you didn't know how to pour a bowl of cereal,
 you would've starved years ago!
 Bernard! Nuh-uh!
 I can feed myself just fine,
 and I'll prove it!
 I'm just gonna go eat dinner at the Creek!
 Fine! Go right ahead!
 Uh, j-just be back in time before sundown, okay, Craig?
 Don't tell me what to do!
 You're not my mom!
 I'm sorry, Alexis, that was super uncalled for.
 We all really like you here.
 He just needs to vent.
 I'll show that chef I don't need him.
 I don't need anyone to take care of me.
 What? All our emergency rations are gone!
 What was the emergency?
 We were hungry?
 All that's left is bird seed.
 I wouldn't go for it.[ Shrieks ]
 It's all right, Craig.
 We can always just hit up the trading tree.
 No. If I'm gonna prove myself, then I want to do this right.
 I'm gonna forage for food here at the creek.
 And live off the land.
 The legends will call me Wildman Craig!
 I'll chop down trees for firewood.
 Rrrrah!
 And grind my own spices with my bare hands
 to make the tastiest dinners in the world.
 Wow, that Wildman Craig sounded really handsome.
 You know, we can help you find some edible stuff.
 I've dared JP to eat all kinds of junk
 I've found on the ground. Yeah!
 Aw, man, I'm glad to know that all that barfing
 was for a good cause.
 Yeah, good cause.
 Let's find some food!
 Hold on.
 Hmm. [ Sniffs ]
 Ah! Here we go!
 Grass isn't food, man!
 My mom and the eight doctor appointments I've had
 made that very clear.
 A-ha! Wild onions!
 [ Gasps ] Ohh. [ Gasps ] Ohh.
 [ Gasps ] Ha ha!
 Oh, my gosh. I'm so sorry!
 I should have knocked.
 Ah, a plentiful harvest for Wildman Craig!
 Guys, look! A squirrel!
 That noble creature is a natural forager.
 She'll know where to find food.
 Ah, this is it!
 They led us right to their village.
 And now we feast on their delicious families.
 JP, no!
 We're here to communicate with them.
 We'll introduce ourselves as their leaders
 and ask them to teach us their ways.
 We'll live amongst them and adapt
 to their self-sufficient squirrel lifestyle,
 keeping us well-fed and fit.
 Eventually, the exposure will evolve us
 into a new apex predator -- half-squirrel and half-human!
 Kelsey, we don't have time for that.
 I'm hungry.Oh, fine.
 JP, go steal some nuts for us.
 Wait, why me?Um...
 'Cause I dare you to.
 Oh, okay.
 Pardon me, little squirrely friends.
 Your pal JP's just lookin' for a small smackerel.
 [ Squirrel chattering ]
 Oh, bother.
 Aaaah! Agh!
 They're tickling me -- violently!
 Uh, thanks for the diversion, JP!
 All right, let's get out of here!
 Aaah!
 [ Laughs ] Stop!
 They're crawling around in places
 my mom told me to stop scratchin'!
 Ooh, how about these crabapples?
 Hmm, too mushy.
 But it looks like there are a few good ones up near the top.
 Yeah, but how are we supposed to get them down?
 I got this. [ Grunts ]
 Ah! My sword!
 [ Grunts ]
 No, not my staff!
 [ Grunts ]
 Wait. I-I'll get it.
 I'll knock it down with my shoe.
 [ Grunts ] Oops.
 Nope. Nope. Nope.
 Well, I ran out of things to throw.
 Oh, what can we do now?
 We're useless without our cool accessories.
 Hmm.
 Maybe it's finally time we assembled...
 aerial formation.
 [ Gasps ] But we haven't had enough practice yet.
 We don't know if it'll work!
 Huh? It will.
 Ready when you are, Kelsey.
 [ Grunts ]
 Kelsey: It was at that pivotal moment
 Kelsey realized her life would change forever.
 She had finally achieved the impossible feat
 of human fli--Hoof.
 Both: Yeah!
 Craig: This is perfect.
 We don't need no snooty-proshooty to make a meal.
 Let's get prepping.
 Ah, the pure, untainted waters of a slip 'n' flip.
 Wheeee!
 Feel the might of my PVC pulverizer!
 Rah!
 Huh? [ Groans ]
 [ Grunting ]
 [ Sighs ]
 Will...you... break...al-ready?!
 [ Humming ]
 ♪♪
 Hey, Kelsey, you got those acorns?
 With an aid of a noble rock, I was able to crack...
 one. Oh.
 Um, h-how about those crab apples, JP?
 Oh, yeah. No.
 Uh, I threw those in the creek.Well, why?
 I'm pretty sure they're evil,
 and I'm pretty sure I'm allergic.
 Okay. Okay.
 Um, uh, we still have the onions.
 We can make onion soup!
 ♪♪
 Hmm, I'm gonna be honest.
 Kinda just looks like dirty onion water.
 [ Slurps ]
 So, how's it taste?
 [ Groans ]
 Like dirty onion water.
 Aww...
 who am I kidding?
 I'm not capable of taking care of myself.
 I'm not even capable of making dinner.
 Aw, poor Craiggory.
 [ Horn blows ]
 You guys better head home.
 Yeah.
 I should probably put some ointment on this.
 ♪♪
 Duane: Craig!
 Welcome back to "So You Think You Can Take Care of Yourself?"
 Tonight in Responsibility Stadium, we have my sons!
 And Alexis.
 Bernard, Alexis, what are you presenting?
 We made Risotto Al blah, blah, blah.
 It's Italian.
 It's delicious!It's delicious!
 You are not only capable of taking care of yourselves,
 but the whole family!
 How about you, Craig?
 What do you have?
 Uh, dirty onion water.
 Ew, gross!
 You are incapable of taking care of yourself!
 Your brother will have to babysit you forever!
 ♪♪
 No!
 Alexis: Sorry!
 It's fine! Just hurry!
 I got to keep stirring!
 ♪♪
 [ Groans ]
 It doesn't look like the picture at all.
 [ Sighs ]
 I'm a failure.
 Hey.
 My parents put me in charge.
 I'm supposed to be the responsible big brother,
 and I just totally failed.
 I'm not capable of cooking a fancy risotto.
 I'm not capable of cooking anything.
 The table is all set. I'm ready to eat!
 Ugh, what do we do?
 We got to serve them something,
 or else they'll kick me out of the union!
 I cannot have that.
 I'm the sergeant at arms.
 Okay! Here ya go.
 Hmm. Hmm.
 This is dinner?
 Hmm.
 B-Bon appetit. [ Chuckles nervously ]
 Uh...
 Mmm.
 It's actually... pretty good.
 R-Really?
 The heck are you talking about, Craig?
 Just add a little bit of cheese on top!
 There, try that.
 Ahh...
 Mmm, tastes like cheese!
 Hmm.
 The cheese definitely gives the dish a robust nutty flavor.
 There's room for improvement,
 but I think we did pretty good for our first try.
 Yeah, good job, Bernard.
 Thanks.
 [ Groans ]
 Pass the cheese, please!
