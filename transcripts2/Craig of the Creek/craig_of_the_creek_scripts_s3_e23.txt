 It's only the third strike because the ump is a clown. He doesn't even know where home plate is. Well, I'm here to pitch snow and chew bubble gum and I'm all out of... whoa! Yah! Ha-ha! I... hit it. Do I run home now? Hmm, maybe I should. Did someone say home? Check out this very official and real letter I got from the city. "Dear Craigory Williams in the fifth grade. We think you are great. For the distinction of being a good boy and super handsome, and..."

 Sorry, it goes on like this for a while. "We are granting you a permit... to build a house." What?! Wait, you got a house? No way. Ta-da! A snow house. That makes a lot more sense. Come on, let me show you guys around. The walls are snow... locally sourced, of course. The floors are repurposed snow. It was just here when I started building. As for the color, I just decided to go with snow. - What do you think? - Wow. Whoa. Th-This is cool, but, like, it seems like a lot of responsibility, being a snome-owner and stuff. You got to make sure your walls don't fall down, and don't even get me started on the decorations. Huh, that's true. But this spot over here would be perfect for a dungeon. I'm not putting a dungeon in my snow house. Why not? Listen, how about you guys just build your own snomes. Let's do it! ♪ Gonna make a snow house ♪ Gonna get some snow ♪ I'm gonna make a snow house ♪ ♪ And it's gonna be cool as ice ♪ ♪ Where the walls are white and the floors are white ♪ ♪ Let's gather up the freshest snow ♪ ♪ And turn it into home sleet home ♪ ♪ Gonna make a snow house ♪ Gonna get some snow ♪ I'm gonna make a snow house ♪ Kelseys and JPs of the creek, I'd like to welcome you all to Creek Street. - Alright. - Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah! - Doppity yippity boppity boo! Let us commemorate the occasion with a tour of Castle Kelsey. Wow, very nice moat. Uh, what do you think she filled it with? It's the blood of my enemies. Ha. Just kidding. It's fruit punch. Now, hurry up and come inside. - Whoa. - Wow. Welcome, friends, to Castle Kelsey. Hm. I am impressed. This is so majestic. Yet understated. Oh, wow. Thank you. It's so hard to tell with thrones. Like, what's too many skulls, you know? Anyway, let me give you the royal tour. So this is my weapons gallery and my complete arsenal of ice. And beneath it, a cozy, but threatening ice place. Huh. How much snow does it take to heat this place? A lot. This is the library with all my favorite snow themed novels... "Snow White," "The Blizzard of Oz," and Mary Chilly's "Frozenstein." So lifelike. Sorry, Mortimor. JP! It took me all afternoon to get the feathers right. That's it. You're going in the pain dungeon. Why is it shaped like me? Because I knew you were gonna break something! Hey, hey, hey. Instead of torturing JP, y'all want to see the additions I made to my place? - Yeah, okay. - Yeah, okay. Oh, wow. It looks, like, the same as before? Or does it? Whoa. Wow. Kelsey, JP, what a nice surprise. I'll be right down. Ye-e-e-e-e-a-a-ah! Aww it's okay, Snowver. They're my friends. Craiggy boy, you really outdid yourself. Heh. I'm the only person who could. Oh. Can I interest you in some ice cream? We have snow, snow, and vanilla. Ooh, I'll take a snow. Double snow for me. Heh, yeah. Aw, man, I should've gone for the double. Hey what's that over there? Eh, it's my rocket ship. But do you guys want to see something cooler? Check it out... a state-of-the-art cold tub. Dang, Craig. Oh. Cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold. Snowball. Wow. Cold tub. That does look good. I don't know. There's a part of me that's like, aren't we forgetting... isn't there another house that we want to see a-as a group? My house. I want to show you guys my house. Um... where's the door, JP? Doors? Where we're going, we don't need windows. Uh, wipe your feet please. And here it is. Uh, interesting aesthetic. It's just a bunch of boxes. Well, that's what you guys are here for. You can help me unpack. I figured we could start with the dishware, then you guys could help me tackle putting this bed together. She's a beast. Um, oh, no. Wait, do you guys see... it's like a baggy with another... it's got screws. Oh, no. Uh, well... Uh, I think I left my ice place on. Yeah, yeah, and... and my snow dog needs to be walked so... Oh, man, look at the time. I got to get to work, you guys. Uh, work? What do you mean? I got a job. To pay for my snow house. Snow doesn't grow on trees, you know. It falls on them, from the sky. Uh, that's a little... a little joke they tell around the office. But seriously, how are you thinking you're gonna pay for your cold tub or your rocket ship or your pain dungeon without a job? Ugh, you're right. I guess we better get jobs. Huh. Looks like someone bought the old Henderson place. - Bobby? - Howdy, neighbor. When did you get here? Oh, heh, we moved in a few seconds ago. - We? - Yep. Me and my son, Snowbobby. Aww. You can really see the resemblance. Hey, so we were all gonna go out and get jobs. - You want to join us? - Okay. ♪ Hello. A Huge Pile of Snow Incorporated, a proud division of Snow Company, where we got so much snow, you won't snow what hit ya. I'm John Paul. How can I ice-sist you today? Oh, your order melted? Uh-oh. Okay, one sec. Uh, hey, boss? It happened again. Well, what am I supposed to tell the customer? I am not saying that. That is rude. Okay, okay, I'll... I-I'll say it. My hands are freezing. Phew! I tell ya, playing in the snow is a lot less fun when you're doing it from 9:00 to 5:00. Hey, uh, has anyone seen Snowbobby? Uh Uh, check the pile? - What? - Ring-ring. Uh, hello? Hey, boss says we need more snow. - How much more? - A lot. His words. Sorry, guys. Looks like we'll be working a little late tonight. - Aw. - Aw. Huh? More Snowbobbies? What am I gonna do? I don't even want to think about snow. I yelled at so many imaginary people today. I was not built for this. We should quit. But we can't quit. We got to pay the snow bills. You're right. Besides, who else would hire us? We're just kids. That's it. Everyone, neighborhood meeting... my house. Thank you all for coming here. Whee! This isn't fair. We work our fingers to the bone, and we don't even have time to walk our fake dogs or see our snow babies or throw JP in a pain dungeon. - Yeah! - Yeah! Wait, what? If our boss wants some piles of snow, then he's got to treat us right. I say, tomorrow, we march into work and show that clown we mean business. - Yeah! - Whoo! Shh. I just got them all to sleep. We, the Huge Pile of Snow Workers Union, have some demands. We are tired. We are hurt. And we have like 80 kids. We need snack breaks, universal booboo insurance, and... and snow sitters. Or you can take this snow, and shovel it. What do you say? So that's how it's gonna be, huh? Then we have no choice but to strike. Uh, Craig? - That's what the snow was for? - To build our replacements? They're closing in on us. Fi-i-i-i-i-ght! Ahh! Uh-oh. What did I get us into? Houses, jobs, organized labor. I just wanted to have a cool hangout. I didn't mean to turn into a grown-up. I want to go back... back to when we were just kids, playing in the creek without a care. But we can't go back, Craig. This is our life now... an endless cycle of toiling, day in and day out, just so we can... hey, where did our houses go? Uh, either I left my ice place off or we should have built our houses in the shade. They melted. We're free. Snowbob fight! Hey, guys, this pain dungeon isn't so bad. ♪ When it's time to go to bed ♪ I know I don't have to feel alone ♪ ♪ 'Cause I'll see you tomorrow ♪ At the creek Just like I drew it.
