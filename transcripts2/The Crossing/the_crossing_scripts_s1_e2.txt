 - From what? - The war. - But there's no war. - There will be. You listed a date of birth almost 150 years from now. CALEB: They took over every government. - Who? - Apex. Man's next evolution. They can do things we can't. My mom kissed me, then she was gone. You got any money? Better empty your pockets just to be sure. - Who did it to him? - Said it was a woman. I'm the sheriff!

I'm starting to worry about you. [Baby coos] ♪♪ ♪♪ I'm gonna take care of you. Synced & corrected by kinglouisxx www.addic7ed.com ♪♪ ♪♪ CALEB: We didn't know if we'd survive the trip. We weren't even sure what we'd find once we got here. If we got here. We just knew staying behind would be a death sentence. Apex was determined to exterminate us... all of us. They burned centuries of human history to the ground. Destroyed everything we've ever known. They stole our freedom. They hunted us like animals. They were genetically engineered killing machines without an ounce of compassion. And the only safe place for us was a world without Apex. So we had no choice but to try and find it. BRYCE: Did you all know each other? No, we were strangers. It was whoever was lucky enough to hear the whisper of the threshold. I don't even know how many of us made it through... or where everybody landed. [Indistinct shouting] How many other camps are there like this? Where's everybody else? Uh, this is the only camp. How many... died? 400 people died in the water. I'm sorry. ♪♪ Huh. [Voice breaking] Our whole lives, all we've known is loss. ♪♪ You would think it'd be easier to accept.

Mm. It's so quiet, though. I-I couldn't sleep. [Bird calls] I think there's something going on. ♪♪ There's more guards around now, and I heard they're taking saliva. Why? It's how they used to read DNA. They can have mine if they want it. Besides, I like having more guards. ♪♪ It feels safe. ♪♪ Hi. I brought you some fruit. I'm not hungry. You have to eat something. You're gonna disappear. We drove so far. How will she find us? My mom. [Sighs] Sweetheart... I'm so sorry, but your mom... she's gone. ♪♪ All right, I got to make some phone calls. See if my deputies know anything. Just, uh, don't go outside. Stay away from the windows. [Cellphone vibrates] Hey, bud. Hey, Dad. Do I need boots? For... what? Fishing. I don't have any boots. No, no, no. No, we're good. Y-You're all right. Okay. See you tomorrow, Dad. Can't wait to see your house. Yeah, me too, bud. Um, but, hey, uh... Uh... it might not actually be here at my house, okay? [Sighs] Is it not a good time to come visit? No, no, no, no, no. It's a great time. What, are you kidding me? I just, um, I-I-I'm working on something special. Okay? But we are definitely on for tomorrow. So, I'll, uh... I'll give you a call tomorrow, okay, bud? Okay. Bye, Dad. All right. Bye. To clarify... I help you get your daughter, you get out of my town and my life. Yes. Okay. [Air whooshes] What? What is it? Someone's here. [Knock on door] Stay out of sight. - Hey. - Hey. Got any of that cold brew? Dog kept me up all night. Not a good time. It's always a good time for cold brew. Right? You got somebody in there? - No. - Hey, listen. As the unmarried man in this particular situation, you are duty-bound to report any sort of erotic escapades. - Nestor. - In detail. Why are you here? [Inhales deeply] Well, the hospital called. Sounds like the Feds are asking questions of our mugger. - Give me a minute. - All right. Tell her I said hi! I got to go. This could give me a lead to Leah. - I'll go with you. - I got this, okay? This is what I do. I'll find her. Besides, people are looking for you. It's not safe. Just... Just stay here, okay? ♪♪ EMMA: If you can get the majority of the people isolated, then we can reach the road at the end. Um, I'll catch up with you later. Sheriff, good morning. Yeah, it was. Until I found out you were talking to my prisoner. Looks like Marvin had a rough night. Marvin has been robbing people for the last two months. So whatever he got, he deserved. Sounds like he "got" the woman who put my agent in the hospital, but I'm guessing you already know that. I thought we agreed to share information. We didn't, actually, but feel free to start by telling me where you, uh, took the survivors. I can't. Right. Good talk. She's looking for something, and I don't think she's leaving until she finds it. [Sighs] She's a danger to your town, that's what you said. Or maybe she just came here for a better life. Sheriff. I need to show you something. CALEB: Apex. They took over the government. They took over every government. They wanted to wipe us out, so they created a virus... ♪♪ ...Mantle's Disease. It killed everything it touched. Whole cities. Tens of millions of people. If you knew someone who was infected, - you had to leave them. - You had to run. Apex wasn't affected 'cause they engineered it so they would be immune. REBECCA: They could walk into any infected area and just take out the resistance. They wanted this planet for themselves. ♪♪ And now they have it. ♪♪ Do you believe this? "Believe" is a strong word. But I'm a lot closer than I was. Look, can we just work together? [Exhales sharply] Yeah. [Engine starts] [Beep, static] She's headed your way. - [Beeps] - I'm on her. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ MAN: You need to reconsider. Harboring a Common is a crime, and rightly so. Look at her. Is she that different from us? [Baby coos] The state paired us to provide one another with counsel and emotional support. Now I am counseling you now... you cannot keep her. She will be discovered. If that happens... No one needs to know. Why are you doing this? [Baby coos] I have love for her. ♪♪ [Sighs] We could petition the department for a procreation waiver and get... I'm not giving her up. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ LINDAUER: I want us doing everything in our power to locate this woman. We are. We have undercover agents in town, we're monitoring police bands, and I had a productive conversation with the Sheriff. I don't want him involved. He's involved whether we like it or not. It's to our advantage to make him an asset. What are you worried about? I'm worried about the prospect of us having to explain how we lost a potential terrorist. Terrorist. So you don't believe in the Apex thing? What do you think? Then why are we DNA testing the whole camp? Genealogy. We need to establish where these people are from before figuring out where they can go. And what about the survivor I sent you... Thomas? Has he said anything more about the earlier migration? Nothing credible. His story fell apart in about 60 seconds. So I should expect him back soon? No. I need a little more time with him. Please tell me this isn't happening. I wish I could. So everything we did to change the future, everything we sacrificed... it was for nothing? Honestly, all that's beyond my scope right now. I've got more immediate concerns. Why even bother? We all need to disappear. That's Eve's decision. Well, have you heard from her? She lands in two hours. How many people survived? I heard 40. - 47. - [Scoffs] It gets worse. An Apex got through. Where is it? My team's working on it. I'll have details soon. No games. No torture. You're just gonna kill it. No. There will be torture. There absolutely will be torture. Get me a location. ♪♪ ♪♪ [Cellphone ringing] - Hey, Jude. - Martin. I saw your press conference yesterday. What is going on up there? Yeah, I don't know yet. Uh, look. I know it's been a while, but I need some legal advice. Okay. Look, I-I'm dealing with this woman from, uh... out of state. S-She just wants to get back with her daughter. She may or may not have a criminal background. I-I can't say for sure. My question is, i-if I... if I reunite them, am I on the hook for anything she might do once I bow out? Stop, stop, stop. Not another word. Look, Jude. Did... Didn't you learn anything from the Doucette case? Yes, of course I did. Look, I'm not... I'm not testifying against anyone here, okay? She's got a kid. And so do you! Whatever the hell you're doing, just remember... put your family first this time. ♪♪ [Sighs] [Phone rings] Oh, come on, Marshall. What'd you do now? Allegedly I hit a guy. I don't know. What do you mean, you don't know? I wasn't there. You weren't there? I need to borrow you for a minute. - Welcome back, Marshall. - Sheriff. Shut the door. ♪♪ Okay, here's the deal... Before you say anything... I followed that... that Agent Ren like you asked me to. And, um... [Computer mouse clicking] I stayed with her 'til she turned on that road right there... that service road. Now, I couldn't hold the tail because there was another Fed that was parked over that ridge right there, but she was headed straight for... this. - What is that? - Camp Tamanowas. I may or may not have lost my virginity there. Summer camp? Yeah. Now, they shut it down about ten years ago, but there's room for 50 people there, easy. I'm telling you, I t-think this is where they took the survivors. ♪♪ What are you doing? It's none of our business. I thought you wanted to know where they were. I don't. Not anymore. Close the door on your way out. ♪♪ ♪♪ [Sighs] ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ How long has she had the rash? 12 hours. Maybe less? But there's no fever. That's when it gets bad, right? When there's a fever? That's right. Can you help her? [Sighs] [Exhales deeply] Why are you trying to save a Common? I believe the price includes no questions asked. ♪♪ The Mantle's is in her blood. I can't get it out, but maybe I can help her body fight it. If I use your blood, your immunology... maybe there's a chance. Hey, baby girl. It's gonna be okay. Just hold on, okay? It's gonna be okay. ♪♪ [Sighs] ♪♪ ♪♪ [Telephone rings] What now? RAWLINS: I think I'm looking at your Chevelle. That's impossible. The engine's dismantled. Well, it looks just like it. Wait. What was the plate number? [Siren chirps] Driver of the car, exit the vehicle. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ [Engine revs, tires screech] [Siren wails] Dispatch, this is Bat-2-1. I got a runner heading north on Pinehurst. I'm in pursuit. [Wailing continues] [Horn blares] [Engine revving] [Tires screech] [Tires screech] ♪♪ ♪♪ [Knock on door] Hey. Hey. I'd offer to help you unpack, but this looks like a one-person job. [Chuckles] I guess you weren't able to bring anything from home. Piece of jewelry. This locket. I-I lost it in the ocean. Oh. Well, let me know if you need anything. [Indistinct conversations] Hey, welcome back. What'd you learn in town? Don't mug an Apex. [Laughs] How we doing with the DNA tests? Uh, good. Just got one to go. She was sleeping all day. Didn't want to wake her. ♪♪ [Birds chirping] ♪♪ ♪♪ She hasn't eaten since we arrived. She doesn't want to do anything. I'm worried about her. Rebecca, she's not yours to worry about. We don't know what's gonna happen here. She just reminds me so much... I know. [Sighs] BRYCE: Excuse me. Could we, uh... could you bring Leah to the office? ♪♪ [Birds chirping] [Indistinct conversations] - Hey. - Hey. I put her in the garage for prints. There's not a scratch on her. Keys were left in the column. Did you see which way she went? No. All right. Thanks. [Sighs] [Cellphone rings] Emma Ren. Hello? Put him in the tank, Nestor. - I got my eye on him. - Do it now. You were supposed to wait for me. I needed some things. You stole my car. I fixed your car. Besides, I was gonna give it back. What's in the bag? Supplies. Give it to me. Come on. ♪♪ Did you find out where they took Leah? Really? It's for protection. Once I get her back, I can't take any chances. [Drawer opens, then closes] Do you know where she is or not? I do. But I'm not going to take you to her unless I know you've been straight with me about who you are and why you're here. I'm here because I made a promise to Leah. ♪♪ Good job. You get a prize for that. A prize? Mm-hmm. When I was a kid, my mom took me to a doctor who had a whole chest of candy. After every visit, I got to pick one piece. And two if I had to get a shot. - Gummies! - Uh-huh. [Winces] Is there something wrong with your arm? No. It's fine. Let me see. It's okay, sweetheart. It's okay. Oh, my gosh. ♪♪ What is it? Rebecca?

Well, those are all the rage, so I'm sure she'll love it. ♪♪ The Commons have made rapid progress on the device that can bend time... allegedly. - Time travel? - Correct. This rumor has floated around before, but my informant swears that it's real. I should have more intel tomorrow. Excellent work, Agent Reece. - Will that be all? - Not quite. A matter has come to our attention involving a severe breach in regulation. - [Door opens] - Is there anything that you'd like to confess? I have always been and remain loyal to the state. We've had every reason to believe so... until today. I told you it was a matter of time. At least now the secret is out. Let them take the child, put it out of its misery, and we can move past this. Please. Let me explain. Agent Reece, the act of harboring an undocumented Common child is tantamount to treason. Violation of state code is punishable by immediate transfer to reeducation facilities. Do you comply? Yes or no. ♪♪ ♪♪ I comply. Then I hereby sentence you to immediate... - [Grunts] - [Groans] [Groans] [Grunts] Why would you... I had... I had no choice. You had a choice.

I just feel like some history should be preserved. Yeah. Watch your step. Yeah. Oh, all the way through here. And we can see them coming. No surprises. [Grunting] Listen to me! [Groans] I don't want to hurt you. I want to believe you're telling the truth and that you're only here for Leah. But you left out some of the more... colorful genocidal admissions from your story. I have to weigh that! Get me out of here! [Gunshots] You're wasting bullets. Door's eight inches of... [Gunshot] ...hard Maple. ♪♪ [Breathing heavily] I trusted you. You told me about Mantle's Disease. But you left out the part that Apex, your people, created it. I had nothing to do with it. I'm sorry. But we're gonna have to do this my way.

I've secured her in a location about 25 miles from you... Camp Tamanowas, if I'm not mistaken. Yeah, that's right. I know where they are.

There's gonna be kids that are just like you. And the best part? We get to be together. Is it far? It's very far. But it won't take long to get there. What's it called?

[Click] This is incredible. And there's hours more. I mean, this is... And they're all saying the same thing. Essentially. It's almost like it's scripted. So, what, you think it's some kind of hoax? A hoax would suggest it's harmless. You think they're dangerous. I think it's possible. Well, if that's the case, we should loop in Harris. Bureau's gonna want to see this. John, I think that's premature. You're already overseeing 50,000 asylum-seekers in a hundred detention camps across the U.S. Let me take this off your plate. That's a lot of responsibility. It's 47 people. It's a drop in the bucket. Let's keep it off the books, no outside interference. Give me this, and I'll get you the truth. Fine. The camp's yours.

What happened at the shipyard, that was not my call. What happened to Reece? The suspect. By the time I arrived, the site was locked off. I was told she resisted arrest.
