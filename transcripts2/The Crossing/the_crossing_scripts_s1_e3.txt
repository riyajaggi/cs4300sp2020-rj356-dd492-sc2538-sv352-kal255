 No one expected to arrive in the water, beneath the surface. Previously on "The Crossing"... We were running away. -From what? -The war. -But there's no war. -There will be. We're not the first ones to comes here. How long have you been here? Longer than you think. Come on, Marshall, what did you do now? I guess you weren't able to bring anything from home?

 This locket, but I lost it in the ocean. Apex took over the government. They hunted us like animals. They were genetically engineered killing machines. They created a virus. I just want my daughter. She can't be away from me. This is Mantle's Disease. No! -Aaaah! Tell me you got an update. Still no body. You said she was hit. "A likely kill shot." Your words. You want to drag the harbor, Craig, be my guest.

 This is Apex. If there's no body, assume the worst. You're gonna need more contractors. Local emergency calls will be filtered through intercept. If anybody sees anything, we'll be first responders. We'll go door-to-door if need be. Sounds low-profile. I know what my job entails. Unlike you, I've actually killed them. Well, that was a long time ago... She's alone. Wounded. And I've whipped up a little something that should give me an advantage. All right, this might be a lead. Infrared is picking up a heat signal in the Western Ridge. I'm scared. Hey, what does being a mommy mean? That you're always gonna be there for me. That's right. Morning. Hey, Jude. Just getting out the toys for the open house. Figured it'd be busy with all the, you know, stuff that's -- Hey! You must be Oliver. I heard a lot about you. Ollie, this is Nestor. Don't let the beard fool you. He is in fact an actual deputy. -It's true. -Hi. Hi. You look like you're gonna be a heck of a sheriff one day, just like your dad, huh? I'm not a big fan of guns. Oh. Well, they've got plenty of other jobs that don't require the gun. Desk jobs and so forth. Dispatch. You could do that, you know? You got to wear that headset all day, you're talking into that, your ear gets sweaty. It's not the best job in the world. Hey, Ollie, there's a bathroom around the corner. Why don't you use it before we go? Hey, we got to take him to the range. Hey, did we get any calls yesterday about any suspicious activity down at the shipyard? No. I-I saw in the duty log that there was some heavy air traffic. Figured it was probably the Air Force just scrambling some choppers out of Lewis-McChord. Probably some kind of drills. Hm. Do me a favor, if you hear anything, get any calls, get me on my cell. Yes, sir. Anything you want to bring me in on? No, just... if you get any calls, let me know. Yeah. We'll be at Harborfest. Yeah, no, yeah. Have fun. Yeah, and kick Marshall. All right. Wake up. I requested a late checkout. The guy you got into it with declined to press charges, so you're good to go home. You got to stop doing this, Marshall. Come on, these tourists come for Harborfest, they blow in like they own the place. It's not about some tourist. It's 10 years since the accident. And I am sorry, but you can't keep living in the past. You have to start thinking about your future. Maybe I don't have one. Who else knows about the earlier migration? No one. You don't have to do this. I'm not gonna tell anyone. You need to understand that here, in this time, you have no power. You have no freedom. You have no life, except the one I give you. I understand. Good. Then maybe you can be of use to us. The best thing is just to be patient. The guy I talked to? He said talking about where we're from is not helping our cause. They think we're crazy. And they don't let crazy people just walk around... Crazy people get locked up. Hey, what's this? He was out of the camp yesterday. He talked with someone in charge. They're ready to help. There's money available to us, places to live, even jobs. Did you see these places? Just pictures. If you want a life here, do exactly what they tell you, and say as little as possible. Where'd you get those? Oh, I found them. Yeah, well, they don't hide who you are, if that's what you were hoping. Do I know you? No, but I know you. And I know what you did back in Metolius. If these settlers found out, I don't even want to think about what they'd do to you. But... maybe we can work something out... ...so that doesn't happen. Hi, Roy. Hey. What's going on? Can I ask you something? Do you know how long we're gonna be here? I'm not a part of those conversations. But I meant what I said, if there's anything I could do for you to make things a little easier -- You could get me out of here. I can't do that, Hannah. That would be breaking the law. There are serious penalties. Yeah, it's okay. I understand. Is there anything else going on? No. No, it's fine. I just -- I shouldn't have asked. Hey, hey. All right, here it is. All right, this is it. What do you think? What is it? Harborfest. It's a tradition. Come on, man. It's gonna be fun. There's, like, games and music. There's a guy who juggles salmon... and all kinds of junk food. Don't tell your mom. I thought we were gonna go fishing. Just you and me. -Yeah, we are. I just thought I'd show you the town first. So... what kind of junk food? Yeah, now we're talkin'! Come on, let's go. Do you think she'll like it? Dad. Yeah, I'm coming. The trail is taking her back toward the town. If she gets to the general population, this becomes a lot more difficult. So we're gonna stay south by southwest. So keep her cordoned off. Amount of blood she's lost, she's lucky to be on her feet. You underestimate this target, she will be the last thing you see on this earth. Move out. You really punching out? There goes your double overtime, just floating away. Yeah, heading back to the hotel. If I don't get some sleep, I'll be useless. What use are you now? This isn't exactly Guantanamo. Give these kooks some colored pencils, and they take care of themselves. Hell, I'll take all the shifts. You're a real patriot. Come on. What is this? Hey. Emma, hi. How's the girl? Not good. High-grade fever, fatigue, some respiratory distress. I'm sending in a specialist. She's gonna develop a screen, make sure we don't have more carriers. I got ahold of the Sheriff. He wasn't too happy. I can't say I blame him. I expect he'll fall into line. I reported on his location because I thought you were gonna give me the leeway to meet with him alone. No, you reported on his location because it's your job. Is there something you aren't telling me? I told you I didn't want him involved. You had to go and "make him an asset." So I dealt with the situation. I made the call. And do your job or I'll find someone else to do it. If we do exactly what they say, take care of ourselves, you know, don't say anything about what's going on here, what happened before, where we came from... Director Lindauer. Good morning. Sir, I'm Dr. Sophie Forbin. I appreciate you meeting me in person. My specialty is quarantine measurements, screening methodology, vaccine production. If HSI needs a virologist, I'm eminently qualified. Director Lindauer. I'm Dr. Forbin. Your paper in the Journal of Microbiotic Virology. Nice work. Shall we? I was one of six co-authors on that paper. My sources tell me you did the bulk of the research. Anyway, let's skip your curriculum vitae. You've been vetted, I'm impressed. May I ask what, if anything, you've heard about Thorn Beach. The shipwreck? Only what I saw on the news. Dozens of fatalities. And 47 survivors. English-speaking, coherent -- though they seem to be victims of some mass delusion. Brainwashing, perhaps? Trust me, you'll understand when you hear where they claim to have come from. What does that have to do with me? One of them's displaying symptoms of an unidentified virus -- A little girl. She's dying. Has she been isolated? Yes. I need you to prepare a diagnostic, see if anyone else has been infected. You need me to stop an outbreak? I need your utmost discretion. You report only to me until we know more about this thing. I don't want to start a panic. Absolutely. When do I start? You just did. Baker team. Stand by. I think I got something. Myers, sound off. Where is my daughter? -Myers. I'll take it from here. Dr. Forbin. Emma Ren. Sophie, please. Shouldn't these people be in quarantine? We believe we isolated the patient before she became contagious. How could you know that? These people have experience with the virus. I was told this was an unidentified pathogen. It's complicated. Look, if you want answers, I'll get them for you. Whatever it takes to help this little girl. Agent Ren, I reviewed the patient's lab work. I've never seen this kind of rapid onset before. She's experiencing acute distress, prostration, exanthema, early signs of brain inflammation, and I don't know how it's transmitted. Forgive me if I sound harsh, but I wasn't brought in here to save a little girl. I'm here to prevent a pandemic. This Thorn Beach thing is crazy, right? The story is they were all dead, but Kara's brother works for the Coast Guard, and he said that they pulled a bunch of people out of the water... alive. What the hell do you think is going on? Well, in the words of my great-grandpa Lonny -- if you can't do anything about it, don't worry about it. What the hell is this? It's a... Nerf basketball hoop. It's an earring, Marshall. Is it? Who was here last night? No one. ♪ I wanna wake up in a different city ♪ Go to hell. There you go. All right, remember. Be the ball. Dad, what does that even mean? It doesn't have to mean anything. It's "Caddyshack." Now come on, focus. Be the ball. Ah, close. So close. So close. We're gonna have to try that one again. This time, skip the weighted bottles. Loosen up. You got to loosen up. Way too tight. Got it? Okay, focus. You got it. Do it. Yeah! What? Are you kidding me? Yeah. What do we get? What do we get? -The gray shark. Of course. Nice! It was so close. Thank you. Nice job! Excuse me, is there transport? Is there -- Hi. Yeah? I was wondering if you could help me. With what? I don't really know this place. You lose your tour group or something? Yeah. Maybe you could show me around? Private tour's gonna cost you. I don't have any money. -It was a joke. -Oh. You hungry? Here. Wow. That's amazing. So, uh, where you from anyway? Um...it's called Metolius. Yeah? I went river rafting out there once. There's like 12 people in that town. It's growing. Where are you from? Right here. I'm gonna leave soon, go to L.A. It's time. I don't think you should do that. And why not? Maybe you're meant to be here. Man: Are you ready to rock, Port Canaan? One, two, three, four. There's so much music here. Okay. You wanted to see me? Hey, Thomas. Have a seat. So how was your visit with my colleague, Mr. Lindauer? It was good. Nice guy. Sounds like the conversation you and he had was different from the conversation you and I had. Yeah. I'm sorry I lied to you. There's no excuse. It's okay. Everybody makes mistakes. But just so I'm clear -- what you told me about the earlier migration... that was a lie? Yes. That's a pretty unusual one. I was trying to get attention. I was scared. You were scared of what? You know, this -- this whole situation. I wanted to feel important. Which is it? You were scared or you wanted to feel important? Uh...both. Jude: Now, who wants to be my next deputy? Whoa, whoa, whoa. All right, all right, all right, all right. Hey, it's not all blasting sirens and chasing bad guys. Although we do that. But you know what? You're gonna have to take a pledge to protect and serve, and then you get a badge and some cool toys. So who's in? Together: Me! All right, wait. We'll get one right here. All right, here you go. Hey, Dad, can I wear your hat? Oh. There you go. Girl: Can I have one? All right. Hey, take over for a second, will you? Excuse me. What do you want? Is there somewhere we can talk? I'm sorry, you're too old to be a junior deputy. Look, dude... I think it's happened before. What? There was an earlier migration of refugees. -When? -I don't know. But I know there's some people at high levels that do. The same people that dropped a Blackwater convention on the shipyards, I suppose. -Yes. -Yeah. Why are you coming to me with this? You're the only person I can trust. Wow. Listen, if there were others, they left a trace. Witnesses. Something. If you went into town and checked the records -- -No, I can't help you. This is important. Hey, you got a boss who's keeping secrets, corruption at the top -- Been there. No desire to go back. Someone see Agent Ren out. Hi, Leah. It's okay. I'm a doctor. My name is Sophie. I have a real important question to ask. Do I look stupid in this suit? I know I do. It's so hot as well. Do you mind? You know, I was studying your blood work, and I saw something that surprised me. The way your body is reacting to the virus, it's like it's already fought it. Have your received treatment for these symptoms before? From my mom. Your mother gave you medicine? She was the medicine. Agh! Ahh! Are you in charge? N-No. He's back with the vehicles. Excuse me. Are you Rebecca? Leah was staying with you, right? I'd like to ask you some questions. You're wasting your time. She can't be saved. That's what I thought at first. Now I'm not so sure. Look, I don't know who you people are, and I don't care. But if you have insight into this virus, you have to talk to me. That little girl is in there fighting for her life. What do you want to know? I think she's fought this before, aided by some type of treatment, an antiviral. -There's no treatment. -She said her mother used to give her medicine, made by her blood. The way Leah talks about it, it sounds like her mother was immune. No one is immune. Only... Only what? She's a sick little girl. She doesn't know what she's talking about. If you know something, please tell me. I have to tell you, they were very nice. They showed me around. I had this sweet liquid made of combined fruit. They call it a smoothie. And more importantly, I established some contacts. For the outside. You know, to have a head start once we get out of here. That's amazing. Tell you what, let's stay in contact. Happy to help. Okay. Hey, tell me something. Did they -- they tell you how long we'd be in this camp? A couple weeks. Really? 'Cause I just saw them unloading a couple months' worth of food out front. The men I talked to said we'd be out soon. I took that to mean a couple weeks. Huh. I thought you talked to just one man in a windowless room. I got to explain myself to you? I'm just asking. And I answered your question. You want to go looking for problems? I'm sure you'll find them. But I guarantee you'll be the last guy out of this camp, if at all. We love you, Port Canaan! Whoo! I've never heard a band like that. Yeah, they're okay. I mean, I don't think the Stones are real worried. Stones? You need to get out more. Maybe you can take me. Y'know, you should be more careful. What do you mean? A girl who looks like you? You shouldn't trust someone like me. Some random guy you just met in a crowd. You're more than that. I was meant to find you. They said you were a good man, someone I could trust. They said if I found you I'd be okay. Is this a joke? Are you kidding me? Come on, we're going. Hey. Hey! Don't even try it. -Don't. Let it go. -What the hell, Sheriff? He can't just take her. -Yeah, he can. And he better. Right now. Come on. Everything's all right. Everything's under control. Misunderstanding. Come on. Baker team, sound off. Baker team, sound off. Drop your weapon. I'm not gonna ask you again. Drop to the ground. Aaaah! High-frequency sonic discharge. In case you were wondering. We can't pick up that frequency. But an Apex? Scrambles you up good. Welcome to the Long Peace, swan. Ahh. Agh. Haven't seen one of you in 10 years. Don't worry. ...I look forward to making up for lost time. How many more are there? I'm the only one. I don't buy that. You splash into the ocean, survive undetected -- you should be long gone -- but you stuck around. Why? Why would you stick around unless there was something that you wanted? Or someone? And when I find out who it is that you stuck around for, I'll put a bullet in their head. Thank you. There you go, buddy. So what do you think, Ollie? Not that bad up here, huh? You all right? Hey. What's going on? What did I do wrong? Nothing. Then why did you move away from me? Remember we talked about my job being complicated? I didn't tell you everything because I thought you were too young, but I'm gonna tell you now... ...because I don't want you thinking for one second that any of this is your fault. Okay? When I was a police officer in Oakland, some people were upset that I arrested them. And I had to leave so that they would stop making threats. I moved away to keep you safe, because you are the most important thing in my life. Are you safe now? I am, and so are you and so is your mom. Hey, you know, you guys are gonna be moving to Portland soon. That's always been part of the plan. Has she talked to you about that? Okay. Well, that's gonna happen. And then you're gonna be like 30 minutes from me. So we can get back on schedule of seeing each other all the time. Okay? Hey, look at me. I love you. I will do anything for you. Anything. HSI Field Office, Seattle Seaport. I need information on the Tamanowas detainment facility in Oregon, please. I'm seeing no record of any operation under that listing. Then do a global search of the entire Pacific Northwest. Key words -- detainment, vetting, quarantine. I'm sorry, ma'am. No match. I have 47 detainees of unknown origin. I have 75 government-sanctioned staff. Ma'am, may I have your badge number? Why are we stopping? Oh, are you talking to me now? And why should I talk to you? You're taking me against my will. I know the camp's not perfect, but it's safe. You're protected there. Everyone at that camp -- they either hate me now or they're about to. Why? Hannah, what's going on? Come on. Where are we going? You need to get in the back of the truck so I can sneak you back into the camp. No questions, no consequences. Come on. Hey, Hannah. How's it going? What are you doing in my cabin? Come on. Can we get past all this wide-eyed disbelief and just get to where we're gonna end up eventually... Good friends. Get out. Now. I'll scream. Yeah? And then what? A bunch of people come running over, ask what's going on, I tell them what I know. You used to be an Apex collaborator. Maybe I'll tell it to that big guy, Caleb. Did you see the tattoo on his wrist? It's an Alpha-Zulu insignia. Do you know what they used to do to people like you? Horrible stuff. Don't touch me. Ahh. You don't seem to get it. While you're in here, I own you. No one has ever survived Mantle's. No is immune. No one except... Apex. What is Apex? Yeah! Yeah. Oh! There it is! Dad, what was that? You stay right here, okay? I won't be long. What's going on? Watch out. Back it up. Back it up! Oliver! Ollie! Oliver!
