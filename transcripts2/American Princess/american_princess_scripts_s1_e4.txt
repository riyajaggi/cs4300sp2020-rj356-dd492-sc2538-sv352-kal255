 [ Sighing ] Oh. Huzzah for the titties. [ Indistinct conversations ] -[ Gasps ] Oh! -Good morrow, dear cuz! -[ Sighs ] -Whoo! Oh, whoa. What's that? This is for Cyril. Cyril, I made you a scoby-thingy, and the kombucha is turning out great. I'd like to think it's because I fermented it in the sun and not in horse shit. -Thanks? -You're welcome. And this is pineapple juice, for your cough. I know it was a little better last night, but the natural bromelain in it will nip it in the bud, I swear. You've totally embraced the spirit of faire-mily! But I don't have a cough. Yes, you do. You were up the last two nights.[ Boy coughs ] That was Lil Boy. Wh-What? This little boy slept in our room last night? -Where else would he sleep? -With his parents? [ Laughing ] I'm his parents! -You have a kid? -You knew about him. I really truly very much did not. Really? Well, this is Lil Boy. Yes, I can see that he's a little boy. No, that's his name. Lil Boy. Until he's old enough to choose his own name. -Fartbox! -Okay, not old enough yet. Why don't you check the fridge for Mommy? This isn't quite cold enough. He's been sleeping in our room this whole time? Sometimes. Lulu home-schools the faire brats, so a lot of times, he crashes with her kids. Wait, hive parenting. I read about this in Vanity Fair,I think. Or a Buzzfeed listicle. Lil Boy: One of the gasket retainer screws is loose. I need Lee's Allen wrench. -Okay. -He does seem skilled. Certainly better here with me than back home with my crazy parents. Your parents are strict, too, huh? My mom made me take French andMandarin. Mercifor nothing, Chairman Mao. Evangelical Christians. I wasn't even allowed to read "The Giving Tree" when I was a kid, because "If it can give you an apple, it can touch you in your bathing suit area." Wow. Yeah, this is a much better place for him. And you. And all of us! -Boobs look great. -Thanks, babe. It'll hold like this for a bit, but the gasket needs to be replaced. Will do. Thanks, kiddo. All right. Three Wet-Naps, two matchbooks, and some toothpicks. Pleasure doing business with you. -You, too, Fartbox. -Unh-unh. Not Fartbox. Good advice, man. Adding more plant-based proteins to my diet. And I'll keep in mind the spirit of the turkey. [ Both laugh ] You coming around, baby. Ah. The showers are all taken? [ Water running ] Yep. Hey! Same body wash. Got to love that Mountain Mist. Great minds. Then again, we do differ in our choices of toothpaste flavor. What kind of person uses wintergreen? [ Chuckles ] What can I say? I'm a wintergreen guy. Well, I also heard that wintergreen was the flavor... used by Hitler. ♪♪ [ Clears throat ] ♪♪ [ Muttering indistinctly ] [ Ethereal new-age music playing ] Good morrow, Your Majesty. You're late. You missed the Stanislavski warm-up. Jumping right into mirror. Thank you, mirror. ♪♪ Apologies for being late, but I just had a rather awkward incident. I ran into Juan Andrés, you know, the man I sort of like, in the restroom. We were in line for the showers. I, you know, thought I'd strike up a conversation, but it went poorly. Five, six, seven, eight. I made a very bad joke... about Hitler. -Zip. -Zap. -Zop. -Zip. -Zap. -Zop. I'm sure it was fine. And lift. -And scene. -And scene. ♪♪ How do I show him that I like him? Invite him over for a Hefeweizen and a light chapter of "Mein Kampf." [ Chuckles ] Really, Maggie, I need your help. Oh, good God, you're obsessed. What's his profession? Janitor? He sells handmade wares. Then show an interest in his art or something. What time is it, anyway? I need to Nair my widow's peak before breakfast. I'm starting to look like Count Chocula. [ Indistinct conversations ] All right, everybody, listen up. We got a couple things on the agenda. There will be no more 25% employee discount on meals purchased on the grounds during Faire Days.What? Lee! What? Boo. Ticket sales dropped opening weekend. We got to pick up the slack. So eat less, and it won't affect you. I can survive on a cup of raw spinach a day. Okay, moving on. Uh, the Queen's Royal Tea will now become the Queen's Royal Pub Crawl. Woman: Oh!Profit margins are higher with booze. And, uh, Callie, no more nip slips at the joust. We had some complaints from the parents. Actually, no, just the moms. The dads were fine with it. Free the nipple! [ Cheers and applause ] Nips! No more moms! All right, let's take this energy outside and show these people what the faire is about. Now, how about three cheers for the faire? -Hip hip... -Huzzah. -Hip hip... -Huzzah. -Hip hip... -Huzzah! Come on, guys! Let's do it! -Come on, come on, get up. -Yeah! -All right, everybody. -Let's go, freaks! Man: All right, everybody, let's go out there and make some money! -[ Clears throat ] -Oh, God. -Yes, Maggie? -The Queen's Tea is a tradition. I've led it every Faire Day here since taking on -the role of Elizabeth. -Uh-huh. The little girls sit and converse with the Queen. It is vital to show them how upper-class women behave. I'm sorry, but we got to pick up cash wherever we can find it. I will not besmirch the legacy of the great Queen simply to put a couple of extra shekels in your pocket. I figured you'd say that, so I am prepared. "It is said that Elizabeth I drank at least two pints of ale every day. In 1593, the royal household went through approximately 600,000 gallons of ale," signed the Internet. The Queen drank beer, yes, but in the refined company of her ladies-in-waiting. She never rubbed elbows with drunken bachelor parties, nor hairy men in ironic t-shirts. Your ladies-in-waiting will be there with you, so it will be completely historically accurate. Just think of it like a royal girls' night out. I don't believe in girlfriends. Bitches be haters. All done? Why, thank thee, fine sir. Woman: I should get a dress like that, right? Your pitcher, m'lords. Thank you, m'lady. A tip for you. Just the tip? Frankly, sir, I'd prefer the whole hog. -[ Laughs ] -Oh! -Hey, Amanda. -No more free beer, Friar. -Lee would have my head. -I'm not here for the booze. Ophelia, the empty kegs got to move. On it. Friar! -Listen, can you do me a favor? -Is it sexual? Because geriatric alcoholics aren't really my type. No, no, no, what? Listen, Natasha usually does my show at 4:00, but she -- she got a ribbon burn on the May pole, and now she needs to ice her palms. -So can you fill in? -Okay, okay, fine, I'll do it. -Oh, thank you. Thank you. -If you move, please. All right. Thanks. Oh, nice muscles. Duh. I'm in wedding shape, which is scientifically proven to be the hottest moment of any woman's life. SoulCycle and kettle bells. Plus, I cut out grains. Such a city lady. -Hey! -Uh, you are. It's okay, but you are. Hmm. Well, could a city lady do this? I can smell your French disease from here. Back across the channel with you, pagans! Hey! Oh, fie, Puritan! Go jack your beanstalk onto a communion wafer. -[ Chuckles ] -It'll release some frustration. You know, the high fives were a little bit anachronistic, but, I mean, you're getting there. You'll blend in, eventually. I'm blending in just fine. ♪♪ All done? Aye.

It's like she's been kidnapped by those drum circle mole people in Union Square. -Uh-huh. -Those titties, though. Yes, girl, those titties. Lexi, can you actually stop calling me "girl"? It's starting to feel minimizing. Oh, my God. I would never, ever want you to feel that. -I'm so sorry. -It's okay. It's okay. I'm mean, I'm just really grateful that I could share my truth with you. -Love you, bitch. -Love you, too, bitch. Mwah. -Sangria. On me. -Ooh. Thanks, sweetie. So, is this, like, your jobjob, or...? I mean, it's part of it. Basically, we're all sort of performers in a larger production. We all live communally, so it's kind of like a kibbutz. It seems more like Rajneeshpuram. -Yeah. -Ma Anand Sheela -is a feminist icon. -Tea. -Cheers. -Cheers. -Yes! -Cheers. Oh, no. So, what's news with you guys? Um, well, Nick hit 10k on Instagram.

Welcome, my countrymen, to the Queen's...Pub Crawl. As you toast the monarchy, you may approach and ask any questions you'd like about our daily lives in the court. Is it true you guys, like, never took showers? Did the Queen have to poop in a bucket?[ Laughter ] Please, let us keep the questions related to our courtly life. For instance, can you guess how many ladies-in-waiting I did host in my time as queen? -69! -69! [ Laughter ] Ah, hear ye, hear ye. Uh, the Queen commands that whomever can consume their beer with the most haste shall be made lady-in-waiting -for the day. -Wow. And you can be a guy. Or however you may identify. [ Cheers and applause ] Yes, what a civilized idea. On my count, drink. One, two, three. -Yeah! -Yes! -Oh! -Whoo-hoo! I suppose I must declare a tie between these two, um, spirited wenches. -Um, please, join my court. -Yes! -Sweet! -And as our first duty on the Queen's court, we're doing shots.

They're not those kind of people. -I'm actually really nervous? -How come? It's the whole mixing-worlds thing. You know when you introduce your yoga friends to your Pilates friends, and the vibe is just super different? [ Sighs ] I need for them to like it. Oh, they're like you were three weeks ago -- a newborn baby possum, blind and small-headed. But then you grew up to be a warm, smushy, sighted woodland creature. This pertains how?

Things were different back then. Um, well, but it's not back then. It's now pretending to be back then. Actually, it's a super empowering place for women. It's super inclusive and non-judgey and body positive. -Like the Trevor Project. -No. Fine wenches, you all look delicious. I wish I could give each of you a long, steady ride on my horse. -A rose, milady? -From you? God, no. I'd literally rather get a rose from Arie Luyendyk -- All: The most hated Bachelor of all time.

What brings Shakespeare down to the Groundlings -without his Royal -- -Do not say hag. -Not nice. -I was gonna say therapy dog. She's passed out. Got absolutely wasted on the Pub Crawl today. Oh, wow. That's -- That's kind of amazing. She was not very helpful to me today as a friend. You okay? -There's a guy. -Mm? Juan Andrés. And I like him. Mm. You guys would be great together. What's the game plan? -The game plan? -Yeah, what's next steps? Well, I made a fool of myself in front of him twice today, so I think my next step is to dig a hole and go to sleep in it. Oh, come on. It can't be that bad. I fear that it really, really was. Oh. ♪♪ Then you got to go fix it. Mm? -Now? -Yes, now. We get so caught up in our own limitations, how we think we're supposed to be, how people want us to be, but this place is teaching me to live in the now. You got to be present. -Be in the now. -Yeah. -Yes! -Yes! You got to go get him! -Yes! -Yes. Go ask him out! Wow. Right. -Okay. Okay. -Uh-huh. [ Laughs ] -Go! -Wish me luck. G-Go get yours, Tiger. ♪♪ [ Sighs ] ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ Hi, there. Hello, Juan Andrés. I just came by to tell you that I'm really very sorry about today, and that the reason I was acting like such a jackass is that I, uh -- I'd like to... be your friend. Would you maybe like to be my friend and hang out with me sometime? I'm watching "Seven Samurai." Want to join? Yes. Sure. I -- Right now? -Yes. Now. -Okay. Yeah, I'm -- I'm free. Yeah. Here you go. Oh. [ Chuckles ] Okay. Such a classic. Sucha classic. I love classics. Toshiro Mifune. I like him even better in "Rashomon." -Oh, yes. -Yeah. Yes. Actually, I've never seen either. Are they, uh, good? [ Chuckles ] [ Chuckles ] So good. Akira Kurosawa? You'd dig him. "Throne of Blood" owes a ton to "Macbeth," and "Ran" is "King Lear," beat for beat. "King Lear's" my favorite. I'd do it at the faire, but it's not exactly a crowd pleaser. -Mm. -If I had a nickel for every time I had to perform, "But soft, what light through yonder window breaks?" "Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?" [ Both laugh ] Of course, they all think that means, "Where are you, Romeo?" when it really means... -Why are you Romeo? -Why are you Romeo? Brian? Yes? I was so nervous around you today. [ Chuckles ] I was nervous around you. Every time I saw you, I got all weird and quiet. I didn't know what to say. Uh, I made a joke about Hitler. I mean, you kind of actually called meHitler. [ Both laugh ] Well, I'm really happy that we're friends now. I have enough friends. ♪♪ [ Horse snorting ] ♪♪ -Hey. -Hey. [ Grunts, sighs ] [ Rooster crows ] [ Smooches ] That's right. So, I'm gonna go? Whatever. No pressure. [ Horse snorts ] Yeah. No pressure. Living in the now. Hey, Ananda? It's Amanda. Nice fucking. Yeah. Nice fucking. Ooh. ♪♪ Ooh. ♪♪ [ Indistinct conversations ] [ Cellphone ringing ] [ Sighs ] [ Cellphone beeps ] Mom, I know what you did. How could you send my friends? Seriously? Nice one. Amanda, it's Erin. Mom O.D.'d. Get your ass home. ♪♪ O0 C1♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪
