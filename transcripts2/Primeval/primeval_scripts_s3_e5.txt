 An anomaly appears in the flat of unsympathetic millionaire Sir Richard Bentley,ultimately turning him into a flesh-eating monster,slowly evolving into a giant fungus. Sir James allows an enthusiastic Danny to replace Cutter at the ARC and,along with Connor,he destroys the former Sir Richard by exposure to extreme cold. Jenny sees an old photograph of herself from the days when she was Claudia and decides to move on.

 Get out of sterling fast. And I want every barrel of oil you can find. I don't care what it costs. It'll be worth twice as much by lunchtime. Lloyd, I need that information on the Price Cooper acquisition. Go round to my flat. The paperwork's there somewhere. "Mr Richard, I have the papers." And can I just say that your new piece is tremendous? I haven't acquired anything in months. I love the light effect. Can I touch it? Never touch the investments, Lloyd. Sorry, sir. I'll have the papers sent straight over. Now, that is cool.

 Crazy. Yes, what is it now? I... Argh! Come on, man, I haven't got all day. Lloyd, you're fired! Morning. Ahem! Urgh! Do you always bring this much stuff to work? Er... Yes. I like to be prepared. I know some of the creatures can be frightening, but surely this many pairs of underpants is overdoing it? Nancy, where's Sid gone?

 Talk to me. We have an intruder in Sector Seven. No identification as yet. Is it small and ugly in a kind of cute way? Just a guess. Helen? Prepare to shoot on sight. Whoa, whoa, whoa! I don't believe it! You've really got to do something about your security. How did you get in? Jumped the perimeter fence and kicked in a fire door. It was easy. What the hell are you doing here? It's my ambition to fight dinosaurs, save the world. Look, I just want to help, that's all. I warned you to stay away from this. I thought you were flirting. It's hard to read women today. Can you pistol whip him? Sir? Just a thought. Mr Quinn... It's um, Danny. Mr Quinn, the fate of the nation, possibly the world, hangs on what we do here. It's not a place for chancers and wide boys. My brother was killed by a creature. Don't ask me to pretend it didn't happen. You've seen what I can do, and I want in. Lloyd! Urgh! Idiot! Pollution's getting worse every day, isn't it, sir? It's the traffic. Find a shortcut. I can't be late for my train. Turn the heating up, would you? I'm freezing. Sid! Connor, I think I've found something. Show me. It's like some kind of lettering. No, it's a sequence of numbers. OK. Some kind of code? Yes, but to what? Connor, come in and shut the door. Really? Yeah. This new lab is amazing. The temperature and humidity settings are exactly right and the plants flowered...overnight. That was your cue to tell me how clever I am. You're brilliant. How's it going, staying at your mate's place? It's good, yeah. All that's... You know what it's like when old friends get together. How about you? How is it living with your baby brother? You missing me yet? What's he doing here? Ah... It's cleaning day at my mate's house. It's a nightmare. I had to bring them to work. This is a climate-controlled lab. You can't treat it like a pet's adventure playground. I know, but you just trying looking after them for one day. It's like Prison Break with... beavers. You're going nowhere until we decide what to do with you. Don't get too comfortable. Karma must really work, eh, Danny? It's not too long ago that you had me banged up. Look at you now. The fact that I saved your life doesn't win me any credit? No. What does that machine do, then? You're not even supposed to be looking at that machine. It's top secret, innit? But it is brilliant. And, you know, it's completely unique. Well, I bet you're wondering who invented it? Le Connor Temple. What? Connor Temple. That's... I invented it. So... Why is that screen jumping around, then? Jumping? Oh, my God! Lester, before you shout at me, I'm really sorry. I'll get the hard drive memory back up and running in seconds. At the risk of sounding like someone from the Old Testament, is there any sane reason why you're keeping animals in the ARC? We must have missed an anomaly while it was offline. It closed an hour ago. I'll get the location. Yes, would you do that? Because that would be extremely helpful! Christine Johnson is here to see you. Here? James. This isn't a bad time, I hope? Christine, what an unexpected pleasure. Do we know where Jenny is? No, sir. Could you find her for me, please? Yes, sir. Now? Now. Nothing wrong I hope, James? Not at all. Don't you have something you should be getting on with? Excuse me, Miss Lewis? We didn't know what to do with these. Professor Cutter had no family. When was that taken? It wasn't. It's not me. It's Claudia Brown. Oh my God, Sarah. I used to be somebody else. Jenny, anomaly alert. I'll cover it. No. No, I'm fine. Wow, nice view. Nice place, if you can afford it. You know what...? I know a lot about art, but I don't really know what I like. OK, the flat belongs to a Sir Richard Bentley. He's the Chairman of the ABS Finance Group. First, we need to find out what this is. Is it fungal? Whoa! Whoa, whoa. Maybe. Ooh... Nice! Mmm. And you need to go and analyse it, quick. Thanks very much. That's OK. Armoury to your left, gym to your right. Research labs are there. And the operations area you already know. Anything else? Yes, there is just one more thing. In private. Tell the Chuckle Brothers not to touch anything. I don't think you've met my colleague Mark Baker, and this is Captain Wilder. Delighted. Shall we? Oi, trouble, don't think you're going anywhere. Make yourself useful. Come with me. We have good reason to believe that Helen Cutter had this object with her. I'd very much like to find out what it is. Why is it so important? Well, it might not be. We'd like to be sure. Never seen it in my life. Perhaps it was destroyed in the fire. Perhaps. So tell me, how is the search for Cutter's replacement going? Very well. We have a number of excellent candidates. I think I have just the man for you. Captain Wilder. He's a fine soldier and an excellent leader of men. I'll bear him in mind. The Minister is very keen on him. Please do send in his CV. I'll add it to the pile. Radical! Jenny, you have to get out of there! Quarantine the whole block now! This fungus is toxic. It's incredibly aggressive. You need to trace anybody who's been exposed to it. We need to find Sir Richard now. If I was still a copper, I'd say that bloke was acting suspiciously. Mmm. Where are you going? You've got two choices - you can trust me or you can call in the heav mob. And why would I trust you, Danny? Cos if I was going to cause trouble, I'd have done it a long time ago. And I've got an honest face. Thank you. Bye-bye. OK, that was his office. He's catching a train. He'll be at St Pancras any minute. That's our guy. What exactly did you do in there? I didn't do anything. He's still alive. We've got to get him out. Forget it. I'm handling this. I've had biohazard training. So have I. Fine. What's going on? Everything under control? Everything is fine. He's helping me. Right. You've killed one of my men. Care to explain why he was trespassing in a security zone? We'll send you a full report when the post-mortem is in. Now, for your own safety, I suggest you leave. How many of our men do we have inside here? Two, on the maintenance staff. I want every inch under surveillance. Do you think Lester was lying about the artefact? Of course he was lying. Excuse me, have you seen this man? OK, the train that's departing from the platform at the far end. Excuse me. Guys, we need to rethink this. Becker, you check inside the train. Right. Better make plans to evacuate. We could be lucky. Maybe he hasn't been contaminated. Sir Richard? It must have come through the anomaly. Past or future? Does it matter? Can you kill it? I'll have to do some more tests. Unless we find out how to stop it, there's going to be a lot more infected people. Yes, thank you, Danny. I do realise that. He's not on the train. I don't get it. I'm telling you, I saw him here a minute ago. Over there. I'm going to get out of this thing. What are you doing? Are you mad? When did you actually have biohazard training? Connor! Danny! What's she saying? Turn around. Come on, guys! Come on! What is that? What is that? Sir Richard? Well, this could be tricky to explain to the next of kin. Good news, he's not technically dead. The bad news, he's turned into a mushroom. What are we going to do with it? I don't know. This all happened when it reacted with the saline solution. Well, all fungi like damp environments, right? Why don't we try drying it out? Bake the hell out of it. We'll see what happens. These tunnels must go on for miles. We're going to need some light. It's not responding. Right. So come on, what's our plan B? You know, just once... just once would be nice. Look... Something's happening. Aaargh! Result! Yes! Abby! Take it out, now! Stay back! Don't touch him! We need a containment unit down here straight away. If baking worked, burning's going to be even better. We're going to incinerate it. - Makes sense. Whoa, what do you think you're doing? What does it look like? Oh, that's a great idea. Let's send a criminal onto the streets with a flame thrower! I'm not a criminal. Well, you broke in here. Yeah, well, I didn't steal anything, did I? You're splitting hairs. The point is, a) you should be in custody, b) you're not part of the team. He's done a pretty good job for us. Twice. Three times. We need all the help we can get. We should trust him. Fantastic! You've been here five minutes and I've already got a mutiny on my hands. Do you know how to use that thing? No, but I mean how hard can it be? Right, he goes, you two geniuses stay here. You're kidding? I so wanted to fire this. Find a way to stop this before it infects anyone else. I don't want any more Fungus the Bogeymen! The management accepts no responsibility for personal loss or injury! Good luck! Basically, it's a fungus. And it likes damp and dark places. Chances are it's still in here somewhere. Look, don't let any of your men get near it. I can't risk anyone else being infected. How are we supposed to contain this thing when our gunfire is completely ineffective? Well, Danny's on his way down with the flame throwers. Danny? He volunteered. He's keen. Yeah, that's one way of putting it. Just look at those plants. Abby is so going to kill me. Yep. Sid? That's where you are. Great, now I have to go back in. This day just keeps getting better! Are you sure this is going to work? 100%. Come on, let's go. Excuse me! Er, sorry, who put you in charge? Look, if I'm going to go in there first, then I'm going to call the shots, all right? OK, follow him, but at a distance. So, look, we corner it and then we grill it, right? Isn't that cruel? What? Well, that thing was a man not long ago. Suppose he's still in there somewhere? OK, so we ask it nicely, and then we grill it, right? Thank you. Sid! What are you doing? Stop messing about. Come down from there,  come on. It's not funny. Sid, this is not a game! Dark and damp, just like I said. Yeah, bingo. Split into two teams. Connor, get out of there now! What we thought was ash was just millions of spores. It's reproducing itself. If it gets into the ARC, we're finished. So fire won't kill it? Listen... No, tell Danny if he tries to burn it, it's going to spread through half of London. Sarah? Jenny, don't use the flame throwers. I can't hear you. What? You're breaking up, I can't hear what you're saying. Anything? Nothing. Are you saying to go ahead? No! No, listen... Cut off. Becker, get down here. We've got him cornered, he's got nowhere to go. It looks like someone's sneezed. Sarah? Ready! Do not use the flame throwers! Stop! What? Fire doesn't work. Stay away from it. There it goes! Don't lose it! We've got to drive it upstairs, contain it. David Lodge? Have you still got that truck? What is it now? Heat, it likes heat. So... Logically... We can freeze it. Sarah, we can freeze it. Turn the temperature gauge down to as low as it will go. What about you? You'll freeze to death. - Do it. I'll be fine. Danny, it's gone up the stairs. Has the truck arrived? - Seconds away. Then what? - I'll get back to you. For a minute, I thought he knew what he was doing. Keep going! Move, move! Come on, quickly! Whoa, whoa! Come on, Connor, give us a sign. It's dying. Right, get him out of there. Where's those blankets? Come on! Connor? I'm fine. Let's get a refrigerator truck over there. James, OK, we've got it cornered. But there's no chance of holding it here. It's too dangerous. Listen, the longer we wait, the more people get infected. Just...keep it busy until the freezer truck arrives. What do you suggest? Give it the Financial Times to read while we wait? Look, we're bringing it to the ARC. So just get everything ready, all right? No... Hello? I don't believe that! I'll see you there! Oh, OK. He's really overdoing the Alpha male bit, isn't he? Something's wrong. No Sat Nav! Show us the way to the ARC. Sarah, you're on! Yes! It's working. In a few minutes' time, this place is going to be colder than the North Pole. I hope someone's paid the Congestion Charge. You're actually enjoying yourself, aren't you? Well, you only live once. Not in my case, apparently. Come again? Long story. Well, try me. No offence, Danny, but there was only one man who understood and he's not here any more, so... Shut up! Please tell me this is someone with a plan. That's everybody out now. We're dropping the temperature in the main room. You need to hold the creature until we're ready. No problem. When I give the word, Danny, release the creature. We need to get it into the operations area so we can freeze it. Yeah, you make it sound so simple. We're going to need a bit more time. I reckon five minutes should do. You've got it. What about thirty seconds? Huh? We've lost it. You what? Well, on a positive note, at least we've got it in the building. It's definitely in here. We just don't know where. Guys, listen up, the creature's going to be hiding somewhere dark. We need to force it down this corridor, through those doors. How do we do that? Freezing carbon dioxide. Whatever you do, don't let it touch you. I wasn't gonna shake hands with it. Let's find this thing! Right, there's two extinguishers in the Ops Area. Ooh... The temperature is dropping, fast. Yeah. All right, let's find these fire extinguishers and get out of here. Where does that vent lead to? Back into the cooling system. The only other access point is through the Operations Room. It's heading exactly where we need it to go. Go ahead. Danny, hi. Jen, good news. It's heading directly back to the Operations Room. But I'm still in here. Jen, get out of there. Get out of there now! Jenny! Abby, stay there! It's too dangerous! What's going on? The creature's searching for heat. But it's freezing in there! It's Jen's body heat. It's drawing it towards her. Come on! Jenny! Jenny! No, no, no... No, no, stay on your feet, Jenny! Jenny! It's going to kill her. Turn off the cold air. The creature's not dead. Jenny's going to die if we don't! Give me a minute. Danny! Oi! What's he doing? Over here! Come and have a go at someone your own size! It's working. Come on. The creature's freezing. It's...it's dying. Go, go, go, go! Let's get her out of here! No, don't touch her! The only chance she's got is if the cold kills the fungus. We wait, OK? Yeah. Come on. No! Danny, listen to me! It's killing her! But if we take her out now, she'll end up like that. Trust me, please. Come on... OK, OK, she's clear. I've got her. OK. Bring her through here. Take her head, take her head. If she's been frozen quickly, there's a chance we can bring her back. Keep warming her. Here we go. Come on, Jenny. Anything? No pulse. Come on, Jen. Come on. Not again. If she stays like this for a few minutes, we've lost her. Not again. Please, not again. Come on. Don't bail on us now. Anything? I've got a pulse. Yes! Here she comes. Hey, hey. Nick... He's gone. Remember? You can let go of my hand now. Oh, sorry, sorry. Hey, welcome back. You scared us. You all right? I'm fine. You know, I'll never look at athlete's foot the same way again. James, there's something I need to discuss with you. Glad you could drop by at such short notice. Now, Christine, I wanted you to be the first to know. You're right, I am going to need a man just like Captain Wilder to replace Cutter. I'm glad you've come round to my way of thinking. Oh, not Wilder himself, of course. No, he's... playing much too vital a role on your own staff. But Danny Quinn here is just like him. Background in the police, firearms training, management skills. The perfect choice. I've already cleared it with the Minister. Congratulations. I'm sure we'll be seeing a lot of each other. I trust that's all right with you? If it's OK with these guys, then it's all right with me. Their idea. Jenny, most of all. Um, Guv... What's the pay? Next to nothing. Seems fair. Try not to make a complete dog's breakfast of this, won't you? Where's Jenny? Guys, is there something you're not telling me? What's going on? You can't leave. I have to. It's your team. No. It was Cutter's, and now it's yours. I don't belong here any more. Course you do. Danny, I died today. I think I should really quit while I'm ahead. I know you, and I know all about Claudia Brown. And I'm sure there's some perfectly rational explanation. Yeah, that's what I used to think. Maybe we've all lived other lives, but what's important is who we are right now. You're absolutely right. And that's exactly why I have to go. Danny, if I stay here, I'll always be looking back, wondering who I really am. I just want to go and try and forget about the ARC and forget about the creatures and the anomalies. And most of all, I really want to try and forget about Nick Cutter and Claudia Brown. You said it yourself, you only live once. You can try to forget him, Jenny, but you never will. Good luck. Sweet dreams, guys. Eh? Are you living here? Yes. But it's strictly temporary. You know how many clauses of the Health and Safety guidelines this breaches? Sorry. Oh, look, I've got a small place in the City I use during the week. You can um... stay there. Till you find something. Really? Yes. And Connor? Yes? Put some trousers on. I've got a feeling I'm going to profoundly regret this. I don't take orders from you. You do now. She knows we've got it. We've got five minutes. I hope you know what you're doing! Stop! We're not going to give up without a fight, are we? ITFC SUBTITLES
