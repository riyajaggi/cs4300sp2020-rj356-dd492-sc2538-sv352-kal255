 Primeval (2007â€“2011): Season 2, Episode 2 - Episode #2.2 - full transcript 
 When an anomaly to a period when the atmosphere was sulphur based opens on the 15th floor of an office building, out pours both the poisonous atmosphere and a great number of gigantic worms. This is Jenny's first taste of what she is trying to shield the public from.

 I'd like you all to meet your new colleague. This is Jennifer Lewis. Jenny Lewis. Pleased to meet you. Ms Lewis has been appointed to a senior position on the team. That means she answers to me, and you lot answer to her. - I didn't think we answered to anybody. - Scientists... That's quite all right, James. I'm used to working with creative people. Please do all call me Jenny. Claudia. - My name's not Claudia. - Claudia Brown.

 I think you're confusing me with somebody else. No, I know, I know. I know you think your name's Jenny Lewis, but... you're actually a woman called Claudia Brown. There's a good reason for this. I can explain it. Yes. Meet professor Nick Cutter, a fascinating study in the tipping point between inspiration and lunacy. - Is everything all right, Professor? - I know this sounds insane. But you're a woman called Claudia Brown. Just listen. The anomaly detector, Professor. You ahhh... remember, you said that we should talk about it. Could we do that now? - It's Claudia Brown. - I know. - Why didn't you say anything? - I know that's what you believe. Me, I've never seen that woman before in my life.

 What's going on? Come on, Professor. You can't go flaky on us now. I mean, it's nearly 12 o clock, and... we're probably going to have to save the world again before bedtime. Sorry. OK. So, no more of this Claudia Brown stuff. At least until you can figure out what's going on. Ms. Lewis, Please accept my apologies. It wasn't my intention to frighten you. No problem. Now, perhaps one of you can tell me what I'm doing here. Your job's to come up with cover stories. In essence, that means convincing people they didn't see... what they actually did. Keeping the public current is the government's top priority. Nicely put. Dinosaurs! Oh, come on! What's this about really? One thing I can promise you Jenny. This job's quite unlike anything you've done before. No I doubt it. When you've been in PR as long as I have, nothing much can surprise you any more. Take Jenny down to Human Resources and finish the paperwork. Classy. Very classy. All set, Shelley? Feeling good? - Fine, thanks, Terry. - I hope so. It's only five million quid and all our jobs on the line. Let me rephrase that - it's five million quid and you job. No pressure, then. Nothing goes wrong today, and I mean nothing. Lambert Smith has a proven track record in the premium drinks arena. Our aim is to make the Nagata brand the best-selling Japanese beer... in the UK market within the next three years. Make that two years. Two years. We believe this product has wide appeal to younger women in the upper income groups. Don't stop now, Shelley. You're getting to the good part. Something wrong? No. It's just a fire drill, Mr. Nagata. It'll stop in a minute. As I was saying, our campaign will focus on the youngs... What's that smell? Smells like sulphur. There's no fire in here. What's that? I've no idea. Chief? Chief? Get out of here! This box! This... Get out. Run! Every time an anomaly opens it gives off a burst of radio interference. No. We didn't spot it before because we weren't looking for it. And you can build a machine that detects this interference? Yes. It's the same as tracking down a pirate radio station, and then we can also develop a hand-held detector to work within short distances. And we'll be able to spot the anomalies as soon as they open? Well, yes, that's the idea. Would it be expensive? Only if we do it properly. I think this is something we should consider, sir. Seems to be our most significant breakthrough to date. Yes, I do understand the implications, Leek. Fine. Tell Leek what you need. He'll see to it. Well, I want Connor to supervise the work, though. All right, but he reports to Leek. I've planned a bold and innovative campaign... featuring internationally known celebrity girlfriends. - Can you smell something? - Smell? One moment, please. Perhaps you'd like to look t some mock-ups, Mr. Nagata? Do something. All right. I'll go and see what's going on. We're on fire! We should evacuate! I'll go and get help. Just... stall him. What? No, no, no, no... I think you'll find it's my choice tonight, Connor. What are you talking about? You chose last week. Do you really think I would have chosen the Texas Chainsaw Massacre? How about something romantic for a change? - Romantic?! - Yeah. How... about... The Holiday? Yeah... Looks nice. Really that's like my worst nightmare. I don't know. You know, I'm gonna go home. You choose. - Yeah? - Yeah. But no horror, no action. Definitely no sci-fi. Bye. Bye... Hostel. Classic. Good choice. But this - this is really good. Sorry. Just... Have you seen this one? It's not bad. I preferred the original. Me too. I don't really feel like horror tonight. I feel like something a bit more... Erotic... Romantic? Fantasy, sci-fi, something like that. You couldn't recommend anything, could you? Helen. Stephen... I'm sorry. I didn't know where else to go. I think I need help. What happened? Getting eggs for breakfast wasn't so easy in the Cretaceous. - What did this to you? - A pterosaur. You need antibiotics. No, Stephen, I need sleep in... A decent night's sleep without anything trying to eat me. Let me stay. Just for a little while. You'll live. - Do you care? - Yeah. You know, I'm sorry about what happened. I was angry. I didn't mean to hurt you. But you did. You hurt everyone. You always do. Report in from the city. Ahh, looks like a new anomaly, sir. It's a fire. Nothing to do with us. We intercepted mobile calls from inside the building, and there's a lot of chatter about foul-smelling gases, and a possible... creature sighting. What kind of creature? Umm, no information on that yet. Creature? Abby... This is Caroline. - Well... Hi. - What is that thing? That thing is my lizard. That's Rex. He's harmless. He's really cool. Hello, Rex. Oh, I'm sorry. He's not... He doesn't normally do that. Bad lizard. Bad Rex! I suppose he's just doing what his instinct dictates. Um, I've invited Caroline round to watch this DVD with us. You don't mind, do you? Only Connor and I were having such a good time. He's really funny, isn't he? Yeah. Yeah. So, are you two a couple, then? Me and Connor? No. God, no. As if. You don't have to make it sound quite so unlikely. Who is she? Dunno. Picked me up at the video shop. She picked you up? Yeah. A lot of women find me attractive. - What? - Nothing. Look, I think she really likes me, so don't muck it up for me, OK? Ok. Why does it have to be now? Not funny. Caroline, hey... I am so sorry, but something's just come up. I'm gonna have to go. It's work. Shame. Do you have a pen? Pen? Yeah. We have pens. Ah, here you go. There are... loads of pens. Here's my number. Call me. It's good to know we can still be friends. I have to go. Is that Nick? His Master's Voice. I want you gone by the time I get back. You don't really expect me to buy all this stuff about dinosaurs? Honestly? No. Can you stop doing that, please? Doing what? Staring at me. I'm not allowed to look at you? Not like that. Like what? Like you know me. See, I feel like I do know you. You don't, because if you did I'd be aware of it, wouldn't I? Not necessarily. Lester told me you were... odd. Don't put too much faith in anything Lester says. I don't see why not. He seems like a very impressive man. You're right - I probably don't know you. You can't come in here. Sorry, this is a matter of national security. Can you ask your men to withdraw until I give the all-clear? - What? - I want all these people back about... half a mile, and if any of your team speak to the press, they're fired. I'd do as she says. Are you always this bossy? I understand the object's to get the job done. So, what have we got? Some kind of chemical leak. We've got a few idiots who ignored the alarm, trapped on the 14th floor. Two of my firefighters are in there as well. OK. Sorry, sorry - I got here as soon as I could. Everything all right? Yeah, everything's fine. Where are you going? - What am I supposed to do? - You'll think of something. If there's no fire, the lift'll be safe. It smells like sh... something rotting. Their version of the Earth's atmosphere. It's probably Pre-Cambrian. It's high in sulphur and carbon dioxide. Help, help! Are you all right? There's something inside the fog. Give me your axe. Come on. Here. Do your job. Get us out of here. Run! Shut the door! It's dead. - What happened? - I'm not sure. But I think it might be from even further back than we thought. The oxygen in our atmosphere must be like poison to it, so... it can't breathe outside the fog. We've got to clear it out. Get onto to Connor. Tell him to think of something. They said there was a fire in the server room on the 15th floor. But there wasn't. Just this... fog. And something glowing. The anomaly. It's a long story. Stick to the stairs. Stay out of the fog on your way down. - There's still people trapped up there. - I know. You've done enough. Go on. You keep it. - You might need it. - All right, thanks. Are you all right? - What's going on? - If I told you you wouldn't believe me. Go to the police. Don't talk to anyone until I say so, - ...and you'll be debriefed later. - Ok. We should just make a run for it. We can't just sit here. If we go out there... You saw what happened to Terry. Can someone just get us out of here? Please. They're inside the building now, but frankly James, I have no idea what's happening. They won't talk to me. Ok. What do we do now? Can't go up. The fog's too thick. The lifts? Cutter, Will someone please tell me what the hell is going on in there?! Tenner says I get there first. Yeah, all right. Come on... Back to the stairs! Stephen? Stephen! None of this stuff is any use. This is the latest in high-tech weaponry. There's equipment here that'd make James Bond cry with envy. I understand that, but we need something that's gonna clear fog. Well, find something that'll clear fog, then. Garden centre. Abby, you are officially a genius. I know you, don't I? I work here. You've probably seen me around. We haven't got time for this. Connor. - Come on. - Abby! Come here a sec. Did you see the scars on that guy's neck? No. They were just... I swear that was the guy from the shopping mall. The cleaner. After the raptor attacked, he just vanished. Come on - you must remember him. I didn't really look at him and anyway, why would one of Lester's soldiers pretend to be a cleaner in a shopping mall? Come on. It really... really did look like him. Cutter? - Yeah, it's me. - Where are you? It doesn't matter. Listen, the place is infested, so don't come looking for me. I'll find my own way up. It's me. Why haven't you been answering any of my calls? - Been a bit busy. - Listen, I'm coming up. No, don't do that. I'm tired of this. I want to know what's going on... and quite frankly, you can't stop me. All right. You take the stairs to the 12th floor. I'll meet you there. Don't use the lifts. I'll repeat that for you - don't use the lifts. Yeah, fine. Whatever. 12 flights in heels? Men! Cutter! Cutter? Cutter! Great. Cutter! The next time I say take the stairs you take the stairs! Watch... where you're swinging that thing! Next time I'll leave it to you to get yourself out of trouble. Fine. It's not as if I was asking for help. You were doing so well on your own. Everything was fine until you showed up! Are you all right? It's all true. Creatures... Dinosaurs! This is my new job. How? I'll explain everything I know to you, but right now I have work to do. If you can't handle it you'd best go back downstairs right now. You two just took your time. Ever been to a garden centre on Friday afternoon? - It's a mad house. - Leaf blowers. A good idea. Where's Stephen? We got separated. An impressive presentation, Miss Mitchell. I believe Nagata Beer and your company can work together. Congratulations. Thank you, Mr. Nagata. Can I call you back? Look out! Connor Go ahead. Follow me. Whatever you do, stay out of the fog. - What are those things? - They're worms. They're just a little less friendly than the ones in your garden. Come on. I think we're all right now. Are you all right? Yeah. I've never been swallowed by a giant worm before, but... it's all a learning experience. It could have been worse. It could have been a lot worse. - Are you OK? - Fine. Who are you people? What happened up there?! I'm sorry. I wouldn't know where to start. Listen - there was a fire, you heard the alarm. You tried to evacuate, but you got lost in the smoke. What about those things? - What things? - They killed Terry. If I were you I'd think really hard about how a story like that's gonna sound out there. Just call it our little secret. Caroline's number! Why? We've got to find Stephen and get him out. Right How are we gonna do that? The fog's coming from the anomaly on the 15th floor. The worms can't breathe outside the fog. - So we have to get rid of the fog? - Yeah. Can't we just open the windows? None of the windows open because the entire building is temperature-controlled. Progress. What's the point? - What do we do? - Temperature controlled? - Air conditioning? - Yeah. All we need to do is heat up the air, and... it'll expand, and push the fog right out through the ventilation system, right? Unfortunately, the temperature is controlled from the server room on the 15th floor. Of course it is. It's gonna get seriously hot in here. - We're going up there, aren't we? - No. you're going up there. I'm gonna look for Stephen. Let me help. I want to do something. Ok. I want you to go and bully a few traumatized bystanders, and then I want you to come up with some spin to just smooth all this away. You don't approve of me, do you? No, I used to think you were really something. But you're not that person. - Am I supposed to understand that? - No, I guess not. Cutter, hi. I'm on the 13th floor, don't know exactly where. What are you waiting for? Come down. Yeah, a bit of a problem with that. Leave it with me. It's hard work this. I need to go back to the gym. I can't believe I washed Caroline's number off. - Such an idiot. - I know. Shame. She's gonna think I'm too cool to call now. Maybe you'll bump into her again, yeah? When was I ever that lucky, eh? You first. - Foggy? - Bit foggy, yeah. I think we're gonna have to find another way in. Ok. - It's clear. - All right. I think we're gonna have to get by without it. Not enough space. Abby, can you not crowd me so much? Little bit of space? This is... Yeah, the server room should be just up here, and to the left. That might be the right... Give it here! No, it's that way. To the left. - Really? - Whoever said men could read maps? I'm impressed. After everything's Steven's done you're still willing to risk your life for him. Meaning what? Lester asked me to assess everything that might interfere with the team's efficiency. I thought Steven's affair with Helen would've come into that category. So, he's sent you here to spy on us? I prefer to call it management appraisal. You think I should leave him up there to die because of what happened with him and Helen? - Some people would. - I'm not one of them. Whatever problems I've got with Stephen, I can sort it out for myself. 077967... 0778967... What are you doing? Trying to remember Caroline's number. Don't put me off. Cutter. You're the team leader. We can't afford to lose you. The most sensible thing would be to let Steven fend for himself. Yeah. Yeah. You're right. Now, are you coming? Are you gonna stay down here, and be sensible? Abby? I think it's that one that's the air con. That's enough. Come back. Worm. Nice move. Connor, In your own time. Sorry. Good. I can't breathe, Abby. Is it working? I hope so. You took your time. Well, you will run off on your own. The fog's lifting. It's working. What's happening to them? Must be the heat. They're expanding. They're spawning. They're not biting. They're burrowing. They're trying to find a new host. Don't let them break the skin. We've got to find something to bring the temperature down. It'll take too long. Anybody got a light? Claudia, are you all right? Don't call me Claudia! And I'm fine. Do you ever wonder... if what we're doing is right? Maybe the anomalies have a purpose. Maybe we should stop fighting, and... face them. Just stand back and do nothing? People should know what's happening. Cos we're gonna need to prepare for whatever comes next. Yeah. How do you prepare for a world where evolution is going mad? We have to fight to try and maintain some kind of natural order. Does anybody really know what the natural order is anymore? Helen? Like a cup of tea? Here we are. I just wanna say I think you did really well today. I think you did really well too. You did good. High-five to us. Hello? The door was open. I think I left my mobile here earlier. That's a relief. I've been looking for it all day. I wouldn't wanna miss your call. That's weird, cos all day I've been fretting about... It doesn't even matter. Do you fancy a drink? Like not a cup of tea, obviously. A proper drink. Somewhere out there. Why not? - Now? - Now Super-cool. Oh, why don't you join us, Abby? Me? Um, no, I'm fine. Ok, here's the thing. Suppose there was another world once, and you were a different person. And suppose there was an accident that happened in the past... which meant that world evolved... differently... so that some people who had lived were never even born, and other people grew up with completely different lives. Now, what if all that were possible? Who is it, Jen? You're busy. I'm so sorry. Who's that? Just someone I work with.
