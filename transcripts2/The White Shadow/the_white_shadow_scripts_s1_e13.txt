THAT'S ALL THAT'S BOTHERING YOU GUYS-- A LOSING STREAK? {\a1\pos(12,460)}COACH, DIDN'T YOU SEE THE BLEACHERS AT THE LAST GAME? {\a1\pos(96,460)}- YEAH, SO? - SO THAT'S THE POINT. {\a1\pos(12,460)}WHEN WE'RE WINNING YOU CAN'T{\r} SEE THE BLEACHERS, 'CAUSE THERE'S PEOPLE IN THEM. {\a1\pos(12,460)}YOU KNOW WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU GUYS? YOU'RE A BUNCH OF CRYBABIES. {\a1\pos(12,460)}PART OF BEING A GOOD TEAM IS LEARNING HOW TO HANDLE LOSING STREAKS... {\a1\pos(12,460)}WITHOUT-- I REPEAT-- WITHOUT FEELING SORRY FOR YOURSELVES. {\a1\pos(12,460)}END OF THE PEP TALK. NOW, I WANT TO SEE SOME LIFE. LET'S GO. {\a1\pos(12,460)}WHEN DID ALL THIS START? {\a1\pos(180,460)}MAINSTREAMING HAS BEEN FEDERAL LAW SINCE 1975, {\a1\pos(180,460)}BUT IT'S ONLY RECENTLY AFFECTED CARVER. {\a1\pos(96,460)}NOW, THE IDEA IS TO WORK DISABLED STUDENTS INTO NORMAL STUDENT POPULATIONS. {\a1\pos(12,460)}THE DISABILITY CAN BE PHYSICAL OR A LEARNING DISABILITY LIKE AUTISM, AND SO FORTH. {\a1\pos(264,460)}WHAT'S THE PROCESS? {\a1\pos(96,460)}VERY SIMPLY, YOU MAY BE ASSIGNED A DISABLED STUDENT AS YOU WOULD BE ANY OTHER. {\a1\pos(12,460)}THEY ATTEND HERE PART OF THE DAY. YOU WORK WITH THEM RIGHT THROUGH YOUR NORMAL CURRICULUM. {\a1\pos(96,460)}IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, SEE MRS. SIMPSON. {\a1\pos(12,460)}SHE IS CONDUCTING THE PROGRAM THROUGH HER GUIDANCE OFFICE. OKAY? {\a1\pos(12,432)}UNLESS THERE'S ANY NEW BUSINESS, THAT'S IT. WAIT A MINUTE. I GOT SOMETHING. {\a1\pos(264,460)}[ All Grumbling ] {\a1\pos(12,460)}WHY DO YOU THINK I SAT THROUGH 40 MINUTES OF THIS? {\a1\pos(12,432)}KEEP YOUR MIND OFF YOUR LOSING STREAK MAYBE? [ Chuckles ] I DON'T KNOW, {\a1\pos(12,460)}BUT I THINK EVERYBODY ELSE IN THIS SCHOOL WANTS TO FORGET IT, AND I NEED SOME HELP. {\a1\pos(78,432)}YOU? YEAH. SO I THOUGHT I'D JUST COME RIGHT OUT AND ASK FOR IT. {\a1\pos(96,460)}GIVE EVERYBODY A LITTLE TREAT. {\a1\pos(12,460)}NOW, I KNOW SOME OF YOU TEACHERS HAVE MEMBERS OF MY TEAM IN YOUR CLASSES. {\a1\pos(12,460)}YOU PROBABLY NOTICED THEY'RE BEHAVING EVEN MORE LIKE ZOMBIES THAN USUAL. {\a1\pos(12,460)}THEY'VE LOST ALL THEIR OOMPH. {\a1\pos(12,460)}THAT'S BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW WHETHER ANYBODY IN THIS SCHOOL CARES WHETHER THEY WIN OR LOSE. {\a1\pos(12,460)}HAS ANYBODY HERE EVER HEARD OF SOMETHIN' CALLED "SCHOOL SPIRIT"? {\a1\pos(12,432)}SINCE PROPOSITION 13, WE'VE HAD TO TRIM IT OUT OF THE BUDGET. [ Laughs ] {\a1\pos(12,460)}JUST BECAUSE WE'RE IN A DEPRESSED NEIGHBORHOOD DOESN'T MEAN WE{\r} HAVE TO BE DEPRESSED. {\a1\pos(12,460)}- WHATEVER HAPPENED TO PARADES, PEP RALLIES? - WE'VE NEVER HAD A PEP RALLY. {\a1\pos(12,460)}YOU'VE NEVER HAD ANY PEP! THE CHEERLEADERS HARDLY CHEER! {\a1\pos(12,432)}THEY'RE EMBARRASSED. [ Willis ] REEVES IS RIGHT. {\a1\pos(12,460)}IF THIS SCHOOL IS GOING TO HAVE A BASKETBALL TEAM, WE SHOULD SUPPORT IT. {\a1\pos(96,432)}YEAH. HAVEN'T WE GOT ENOUGH TO WORRY ABOUT? {\a1\pos(12,460)}WE'RE TEACHERS, PROFESSIONALS. I MEAN, WHO CARES ABOUT PEP RALLIES? {\a1\pos(12,460)}NOW, WAIT A MINUTE. YOU JUST SPENT THE WHOLE MEETING ON THE MAINSTREAMING PROGRAM. {\a1\pos(12,460)}NOW, I THINK THAT'S A WONDERFUL PROJECT. BUT YOU'RE TEACHERS, {\a1\pos(12,460)}SO THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU TO HELP HANDICAPPED STUDENTS. {\a1\pos(12,460)}BUT WHY DON'T YOU USE A LITTLE BIT OF THE SAME ENERGY TO BRING SOME SPIRIT INTO THE SCHOOL? {\a1\pos(180,460)}THAT'S A PRETTY SPEECH, AND FINE FOR YOU. {\a1\pos(12,460)}BUT YOU'RE A COACH, AND NOBODY IS GONNA ASSIGN YOU A CRIPPLED STUDENT TO MAINSTREAM. {\a1\pos(12,460)}PLEASE, WE WERE TALKING ABOUT SCHOOL SPIRIT. NOW, WHAT'D YOU HAVE IN MIND, KEN? {\a1\pos(12,460)}I THOUGHT WE COULD START SMALL-- ENCOURAGE THE KIDS TO COME OUT TO THE GAMES. {\a1\pos(96,460)}MAYBE WE COULD START BY GETTING OURSELVES A SCHOOL MASCOT. {\a1\pos(96,460)}I LIKE IT. WHY NOT? YOU MEAN, A MASCOT THAT YOU HAVE AT ALL THE GAMES? {\a1\pos(12,460)}YEAH. I THOUGHT WE COULD HAVE SOME SORT OF COSTUME MADE. {\a1\pos(12,460)}WELL, MY ART CLASS NEEDS A LITTLE PROJECT. WE'LL DREAM UP SOMETHING. {\a1\pos(12,460)}GREAT. I APPRECIATE THAT. THAT'LL REALLY HELP ME TO TURN THESE KIDS INTO WINNERS. {\a1\pos(264,460)}AH, WINNING ISN'T EVERYTHING. {\a1\pos(180,460)}[ Sighs ] WORDS TO LIVE BY, MRS. SIMPSON. THANK YOU. {\a1\pos(96,460)}YEAH.

COULD I SPEAK WITH YOU A MINUTE? {\a1\pos(36,432)}YEAH, WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU? WELL, I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING THE MAINSTREAM ASSIGNMENTS HERE, {\a1\pos(12,460)}AND THERE'S A STUDENT I WOULD LIKE TO ASSIGN TO YOUR BASKETBALL PROGRAM. {\a1\pos(180,460)}IT'S NOT A BASKETBALL PROGRAM, IT'S A BASKETBALL TEAM. {\a1\pos(12,460)}[ Chuckles ] PROGRAM, TEAM, IT'S THE SAME THING. {\a1\pos(12,460)}ANYWAY, PART OF MY JOB IS TO FIND... {\a1\pos(12,460)}INTERESTED FACULTY MEMBERS WHO WOULD WORK WITH THESE YOUNGSTERS, {\a1\pos(12,460)}AND THERE'S A BOY THAT I THINK WOULD BE JUST PERFECT FOR YOU. {\a1\pos(180,460)}WEREN'T YOU LISTENING TO WHAT I WAS SAYING IN THE FACULTY MEETING? {\a1\pos(12,460)}MY TEAM'S IN THE BASEMENT. WE'RE ON A LOSING STREAK. THEY'RE LOSING FAITH IN THEMSELVES. {\a1\pos(264,404)}I GOT PROBLEMS. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. {\a1\pos(12,460)}YOU SEE, THIS SITUATION IS JUST TAILOR-MADE FOR YOU. {\a1\pos(12,460)}HAVE YOU BEEN TO THE GYM LATELY? I GOT 12 BASKET CASES ON MY HANDS. I DON'T NEED ONE MORE. {\a1\pos(180,460)}[ Reeves, Indistinct ] COME ON. {\a1\pos(180,432)}COME ON. COME ON, THORPE. GET OVER THERE. {\a1\pos(264,404)}ONE MORE, ONE MORE.

WE CAN TALK HERE. {\a1\pos(12,432)}NOW, LOOK, I'M NOT CHANGING MY MIND. WHY NOT? {\a1\pos(12,460)}I GOT MORE PROBLEMS WITH THESE ANIMALS THAN I CAN HANDLE AS IT IS. {\a1\pos(12,460)}I DON'T THINK ASSIGNING A KID IN A WHEELCHAIR TO THE BASKETBALL TEAM'S... {\a1\pos(12,460)}GONNA DO ANYBODY ANY GOOD. {\a1\pos(12,460)}NOW, I THINK THE MAINSTREAMING PROGRAM IS WONDERFUL. I'M SURE YOU'RE DOING A WONDERFUL JOB. {\a1\pos(12,432)}BUT THE BASKETBALL TEAM IS NO PLACE FOR A CRIPPLED KID. TOM IS NOT A CRIPPLE! {\a1\pos(96,460)}I WOULDN'T ASSIGN A WHEELCHAIR-BOUND STUDENT TO AN AMBULATORY SPORT. {\a1\pos(264,460)}TOM IS AUTISTIC. HE HAS DIFFICULTY... {\a1\pos(96,460)}WITH SOCIAL INTERRELATION AND EXTERNALIZED ATTENTION. {\a1\pos(162,432)}THAT'S ALL. "THAT'S ALL"? I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS. {\a1\pos(12,460)}LET ME READ YOU SOME COMMENTS FROM THE SPECIAL-EDUCATION TEACHERS AT BRONSON SCHOOL. {\a1\pos(180,460)}"TOM HAS REALLY ADJUSTED TO GROUP ACTIVITY... {\a1\pos(96,460)}"AND SHOWS HIS STRONGEST DEVELOPMENT IN OUR BASKETBALL GAMES. {\a1\pos(96,404)}YEAH. HE LEADS HIS TEAM--" {\a1\pos(12,432)}YEAH. THANKS, BUT NO THANKS.

WHY ARE YOU BUGGIN' ME? YOU STOPPED ME IN THE HALLWAY. {\a1\pos(12,460)}YOU ASKED ME. I SAID NO. YOU CAME DOWN TO THE GYM. YOU ASKED ME AGAIN. AGAIN, I SAID NO. {\a1\pos(12,460)}NOW YOU'RE LEAVIN' NOTES ON MY BLACKBOARD. {\a1\pos(12,460)}WHAT'S NEXT? THREATENING PHONE CALLS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT? {\a1\pos(264,460)}SHH!

I CANNOT PUT THAT KID ON MY BASKETBALL TEAM. {\a1\pos(12,460)}MAYBE I CAN WORK WITH HIM SOME WEEKENDS, SOMETHING UNOFFICIAL, BUT-- {\a1\pos(180,460)}YEAH, BUT THE WHOLE IDEA ABOUT MAINSTREAMING IS TO PUT THE CHILD... {\a1\pos(180,460)}INTO A NORMAL SCHOOL FOR PART OF EVERY DAY. {\a1\pos(12,460)}I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY. {\a1\pos(180,460)}OH, THIS IS TERRIBLE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO DO NOW. {\a1\pos(12,432)}AREN'T YOU OVERREACTING JUST A LITTLE BIT?

SHE PUT HER FOOT IN HER MOUTH. {\a1\pos(12,460)}- NOW SHE WANTS ME TO BAIL HER OUT. - WELL, DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT. {\a1\pos(12,432)}SHE'LL GET A FORMAL REPRIMAND. IN THE MEANTIME, YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF A BIND THIS PUTS ME IN? {\a1\pos(96,460)}SHE WAS WRONG.

I COULD REALLY DO SOMETHIN' WRONG AND SCREW UP A KID LIKE THAT. {\a1\pos(12,460)}I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU. EVER SINCE YOU GOT HERE, {\a1\pos(12,460)}YOU'VE BEEN STICKING YOUR NOSE INTO THE PERSONAL PROBLEMS OF EVERY KID ON YOUR TEAM. {\a1\pos(12,460)}NOW THAT YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO HELP A KID AS A LEGITIMATE PART OF YOUR JOB-- {\a1\pos(12,460)}THAT'S DIFFERENT. WITH THOSE KIDS, I PUSH 'EM AROUND A LITTLE BIT, AND THEY'LL STRAIGHTEN OUT. {\a1\pos(180,404)}BUT THIS KID'S GOT-- A REAL PROBLEM. {\a1\pos(516,460)}YEAH! {\a1\pos(96,460)}SO YOU WANT ME TO PUT THIS KID WITH A REAL PROBLEM IN WITH JACKSON AND HAYWARD? {\a1\pos(96,460)}IN THE FIRST PLACE, THE BOY WAS ASSIGNED TO YOU, NOT THE TEAM. {\a1\pos(180,460)}SO WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO WITH HIM? {\a1\pos(12,432)}I THINK MAYBE YOU'RE AFRAID, KEN. AFRAID? {\a1\pos(12,460)}UH, OKAY-- UPSET. DISABILITIES ARE UPSETTING. {\a1\pos(12,404)}IT'S ONLY NATURAL. [ Sighs ] {\a1\pos(12,460)}NOW, THEY MAKE US REALIZE HOW VULNERABLE WE ARE. {\a1\pos(12,432)}AS AN ATHLETE, YOU'RE STRIVING FOR PHYSICAL PERFECTION. DON'T TRY TO PSYCH ME OUT, DOC. {\a1\pos(180,460)}I KNOW WHAT I MEAN. WHAT I MEAN IS, I'VE MET TOM HENDRICKS, {\a1\pos(180,460)}AND PUTTING HIM ON MY BASKETBALL TEAM IS A BIG MISTAKE. {\a1\pos(12,460)}THE KID'S LOST IN HIS OWN WORLD, AND IF YOU PUT HIM ON THE TEAM... {\a1\pos(96,460)}WHEN YOU KNOW DAMN WELL I CAN'T PLAY HIM, HE'LL JUST FEEL LEFT OUT. {\a1\pos(12,460)}- NOW WHO'S TRYING TO DO THE PSYCHING OUT? - WELL, I CAN'T MAINSTREAM HIM. {\a1\pos(12,460)}DON'T SELL YOURSELF SHORT. {\a1\pos(12,460)}YOU'VE ALREADY DONE WHAT AMOUNTS TO MAINSTREAMING A WHOLE TEAM OF MISFITS. {\a1\pos(201,460)}YEAH, BUT THEY DON'T HAVE HIS PROBLEMS. {\a1\pos(12,460)}THERE HAS GOT TO BE SOMETHING CONSTRUCTIVE YOU CAN DO WITH TOM.

BUT I'LL TELL YOU RIGHT NOW, I'M LEANIN' THE OTHER WAY, {\a1\pos(180,460)}AND I DON'T LIKE BEING BULLDOZED INTO ANYTHING. {\a1\pos(369,460)}[ Door Slams ] {\a1\pos(12,460)}[ Mrs. Simpson ] OH, MR.
