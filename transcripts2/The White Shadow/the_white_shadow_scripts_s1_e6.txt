OH, YES. {\a1\pos(180,460)}I HEARD ABOUT YOUR LITTLE INCIDENT. {\a1\pos(12,460)}WHAT ARE YOU TAPPING MY PHONE? {\a1\pos(180,432)}DID YOU REALLY CALL THE POLICE ON HIM? SURE. {\a1\pos(12,460)}IT WAS THE QUICKEST WAY TO FIND HIM. HE HAD SOME PRETTY UGLY BOYS LOOKIN' FOR HIM. {\a1\pos(180,460)}ALL BECAUSE OF SOMETHING AS STUPID AS BETTING ON A FOOTBALL GAME. {\a1\pos(180,460)}I SWEAR, I'LL NEVER UNDERSTAND THE THRILL OF ALL THAT. {\a1\pos(96,460)}YOU MIGHT AS WELL JUST TAKE YOUR MONEY AND THROW IT OFF THE SANTA MONICA PIER. {\a1\pos(12,460)}YOU MEAN TO TELL ME YOU'VE NEVER BET ON ANYTHING IN YOUR LIFE? {\a1\pos(264,460)}OF COURSE NOT. IT'S A SILLY WASTE. WHY RISK THE MONEY? {\a1\pos(12,432)}IT'S NOT JUST THE MONEY, IT'S THE RISK. YOU EVER BET ON BASKETBALL? {\a1\pos(96,404)}SURE. HOW DO YOU DO? {\a1\pos(12,460)}USUALLY PRETTY CRUMMY. MY PROBLEM IS I BET MORE WITH MY HEART THAN MY HEAD. {\a1\pos(180,460)}NOW WAIT A SECOND. AREN'T YOU THE GUY THAT'S ALWAYS SAYING, {\a1\pos(180,460)}"TRUST ME. I'VE GOT A FEELING"? {\a1\pos(12,460)}THAT'S A DIFFERENT KIND OF THING. THAT'S LIFE STUFF. {\a1\pos(12,460)}SEE, WHEN YOU BET ON SOMETHING YOU CAN'T PHYSICALLY CONTROL, {\a1\pos(12,460)}YOU GOTTA BE COOL AND OBJECTIVE IN DETERMINING YOUR BET. {\a1\pos(12,404)}THAT'S 99% OF THE GAME. WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER 1%? {\a1\pos(12,404)}THAT'S WHY I LOSE. YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK? {\a1\pos(12,432)}NOT OFTEN ENOUGH. I THINK YOU'RE IN AN ARRESTED STAGE... {\a1\pos(348,460)}OF ADOLESCENT DEVELOPMENT. {\a1\pos(12,460)}YOU HAVE AN ORAL FIXATION AND YOU COULD PROBABLY TURN INTO A MANIC-DEPRESSIVE. {\a1\pos(264,460)}NOW ALL THIS PROBABLY STEMS... {\a1\pos(180,460)}FROM YOUR MOTHER'S LACK OF AFFECTION TOWARDS YOU AS A CHILD. {\a1\pos(12,404)}NO MOTHERS. OH. OKAY. {\a1\pos(180,404)}NOW ABOUT BOBBY MAGGUM. YEAH. {\a1\pos(96,460)}MAY I ASSUME THAT HE'S NOT IN JAIL AT THIS MOMENT? {\a1\pos(96,460)}MAY I ALSO ASSUME HE'S BACK HERE IN SCHOOL? {\a1\pos(12,432)}HE SAID SOMETHIN' ABOUT GOIN' BACK UP NORTH. TO SCHOOL? {\a1\pos(12,432)}I GUESS. WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU GUESS? BECAUSE OF YOU... {\a1\pos(180,460)}I'VE BENT OVER BACKWARDS TO GET HIM INTO CARVER. {\a1\pos(12,460)}RELAX. I THINK HE'S GONNA BE FINE AND IN SCHOOL. {\a1\pos(96,460)}[ Sighs ] OH, I MUST BE GETTING SOFT OR SOMETHING. I DON'T KNOW. {\a1\pos(96,460)}YOU KEEP COMING TO ME WITH THESE HALF-BAKED SCHEMES ABOUT THIS STUDENT, {\a1\pos(180,460)}THAT BASKETBALL PLAYER, AND I KEEP LETTING YOU TALK ME INTO A CORNER. {\a1\pos(12,460)}LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING. WHO WAS CARVER HIGH'S LAST BASKETBALL COACH? {\a1\pos(516,404)}REEVES. FUNNY. {\a1\pos(516,460)}UH... {\a1\pos(180,460)}GEORGE FARRINGTON-- NO, NO. HE WAS TRACK. {\a1\pos(432,432)}UM, BAKER. JAMES BAKER. FOOTBALL. {\a1\pos(348,404)}OH. LET'S SEE. I REST MY CASE. {\a1\pos(12,460)}OKAY.

PLEASE. {\a1\pos(12,432)}OKAY, I CAN TAKE A HINT. THANK YOU. I'LL BE UP ALL NIGHT AS IT IS. {\a1\pos(12,460)}THAT'S WHY YOU'RE GETTIN' THE BIG MONEY. {\a1\pos(12,404)}[ Door Closes ] [ Sighs ] {\a1\pos(264,460)}YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANNA STAY? WE COULD USE YOU. {\a1\pos(12,460)}I'M GOIN' BACK TO SCHOOL, MAN-- IN OAKLAND. {\a1\pos(12,460)}THAT'S MY HOME. {\a1\pos(264,460)}WELL, WE'LL SEND 'EM YOUR RECORDS. {\a1\pos(264,460)}IF YOU NEED ANY HELP GETTING REGISTERED, LET US KNOW. {\a1\pos(12,460)}YEAH. THANKS FOR ALL YOU DID. {\a1\pos(96,460)}I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. I JUST TOLD 'EM THE TRUTH. {\a1\pos(12,460)}NO, MAN, BUT YOU SEE, IF I'D BEEN IN THAT SITUATION, MAN-- {\a1\pos(12,460)}I MEAN, YOU HAD EVERY RIGHT AFTER WHAT I DID. {\a1\pos(12,460)}IT'S NOT IMPORTANT WHAT YOU DID.
