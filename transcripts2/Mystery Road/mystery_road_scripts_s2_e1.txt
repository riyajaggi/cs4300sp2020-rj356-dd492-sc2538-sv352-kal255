 He's got no head. We get big tides up here. It was a full moon, king tide last night. That body could've been dumped anywhere out there, tide's washed it in here. Who found the body? Wayan. He's a local. He works around here, catching crabs. In his pots. So he's not a suspect, then? - Wayan? - No. No, he's harmless. Go see for yourself - that's his camp up there. Franny'll take you.

 Why wasn't this crime scene better contained? I've got shit to do, Detective. Well, it must be important. I've got an understaffed station to run, a town to look after. Yeah, well, it's just gonna have to wait. Excuse me? Somebody has to wait with this body until Forensics arrive. And since Constable Davis is taking me up there, that somebody is you. Did you see or hear anything round about the time you found that body? Crocodiles barking, fish jumping, mosquito buzzing. Alright. If you think of anything or remember anything, you let me know, OK? You want crab to take home? Yes, please. You want some of them crabs? What, you don't like crabs? Can't be. You must be the first blackfella I've met who don't eat crabs. Any missing tourists reported in town? There's no missing middle-aged whitefellas. It's mostly black teenagers that go missing around here. What about tensions in town? Conflicts, fights? There's pension day card game conflicts - nothing too exciting. Head up this way and then take a left - we'll go around. - Go on, then. Keep it coming. - Keep it coming. Oh, look at this mob coming. Different car. Here. Give it here. One flash car, that. Wanna come and meet Oscar? Hey, look out, now - big boss lady coming this way with her boss man. Can't be. Can be. What now, Daughter girl? You bring feed for Uncle? - You gotta share it. - Always. What do you think I am? Hey, you been fishing out at Dabby's Point lately? Nothing. No motorcar. Fishing off jetty. You know anyone who's been out there lately? Any families fishing? Charters? And who this one, mook-mook eyes? This your husband? Hey, you wanna pull up there, now, Uncle? This is Detective Jay Swan. And where you from, Detective Jay? Hello? I'm not from here. We gotta go. Boss wants to talk. You hear about anything out there, you let us know, eh, Oscar? - Hey. - Come on, now. So how do you reckon he chopped his own head off? Pissed, fell overboard, decapitated by the motor. You really think that's what happened? No. But even with a murder, sometimes it's not murder. This looks like a message. Revenge, love, drugs. - Any theories, Owen? - Not at this stage. And at what stage do you think you'll have something? Look, Detective, this isn't Sydney or Melbourne, you know. This is a small town. A few drunks. A bit of grog running. A bit of ganja. You know? Type of town where after work a bloke might have a few too many and belt his wife. And that's OK by you? I'm sorry to disappoint you, Detective. We don't have drug cartels here. Are you sure about that, Owen? Because, with a little bit of help, drug cartels become part of a community, they become part of the economy. You know what? I reckon you can figure this out by yourself. Whatever, but, you'll have to wait till the morning - pathologist doesn't work this late. This is a homicide investigation - get 'em on the phone. You serious? About a year ago, there was a lot of ice moving through town. Big freeze, people reckon. Families busted up, fighting, stealing. And what happened? Well, it all stopped after a big bust of a meth lab out bush. Wasn't 'cause of Owen's deadly police work. Anonymous tip. After that? No more drugs. It's like someone flipped a switch. Chances of survival after you've had your head removed aren't good. Deep, clean cut - boning knife, I reckon. He didn't go down easy. He put up a fight, and then he was thrown to the fishes. Any idea who he is? No. But there's a tattoo of a bull on his inner left arm. Could be a prison tatt. There's old burns on his hands - the kind chefs get. - Or meth cooks. - Hmm. Found these in his throat. Did he swallow them? No, somebody shoved them down there. What type of pills are they? Dunno. I haven't seen them before. We'll send them down south with his prints. If Sleepy Hollow here is a meth cook like you say, he should have a record. Shouldn't take long. What are we looking for? Who's that? I'm going to bed. The prints on the body came back positive for a... ...Clarrie Stewart. Did time for drug possession and supply. A local? Yep. Any family? We're making inquiries about Clarrie Stewart. This is his last known address. Yeah? And you are? Kayla Daniels. You're Clarrie's partner? Have you got any family or friends that you could call? Why? No. I... I can't let you do this. I'm not gonna let you do it. - I'm sorry, Kayla, but... - Can't... I can't... I'm not gonna let you do it! Oh, my God! I told him. I told him whatever he was into, he just needed... ...he just needed to get out of it. But he wouldn't listen. It's why I kicked him out. I knew they were bad people. They just reeked of it. Who are these people? Are you mad? If they did that to him, what do you think they're gonna do to me? Or my kids? You tell me what I need to know and I'll promise you I'll protect you. You can't... You can't promise me that, OK? They're bigger than you. They're bigger than everyone. Can I see him? You don't want your last memories of him to be in the morgue. Clarrie was in the water a long time. He was a good dad. He was... He was a prick but he was a good dad. Who was Clarrie working for, Kayla? This is the day they're supposed to spend with him, you know? They've been bugging me about it all day. "Where's Daddy?" What am I... What am I supposed to tell them? You worry about your kids. I know that feeling. Tell me who Clarrie was working for. You just don't know them. Yes, I do. Hey. I've gone up against this mob before. I know what they're capable of. When someone gets in their way, they deal with them. You don't want to get in the way, Kayla. No. I haven't gone against them. I haven't done anything wrong. If you can't help me, then I can't help you and your kids. If I could pull the trigger, I would. The shit that Clarrie was caught up in was from the Westside Trucking yard. Some bloke called Dylan was giving him a hard time. Clarrie thought that he could sort it out but... I mean, they're dogs. Just... I want justice. OK? I want justice for my kids, Detective. Emilio Gordon? - I know you? - I don't think you do. Where are you from? Just making inquiries about an employee of yours. Clarrie Stewart, does he work here? Not anymore. Why's that? Dunno. You'd have to ask him. He's the one who quit. When was that? While back. Why'd he quit? Dunno, mate. As I said, you'd have to ask him. I want to speak to one of your other employees, Dylan Lindwall. Dylan, hey? I don't know what kind. Too hot to go digging around. - No, do I tell her? - Yeah. Come to our country and, what... ...and sit out in the sun all day, big mob shade there. You mob 'nother kind but good way. My baby. 150 horsepower. 120-litre fuel tank. Flared bow. Smooth as. Take her anywhere. Creeks, oceans. Present to myself for the big ice bust. I'm counting the days, Detective. A few months' time and I'll be fishing every day. Just me and her. What's the story with West Side Trucking? - What are you looking for? - Emilio. Emilio Gordon? Oh, yeah. Done well for himself. Built that trucking company up. - How? - Hard work. And what about Dylan? Dylan? Yeah. Be careful. Hasn't been here long. Doesn't want people looking at him. Tends to knock them out. You're welcome. Hey... ...Fran says you told a witness you knew who the killer was. Said you were tracking him. Anytime you want to share information, Detective... You wanker. I am the big... I'm the boss man here. She was digging out past the fence line. - Ah. - She's playing you, Amos. - But you're too stupid to see it. - You shut up. Yeah, but you're nothing. Oh, you don't know what you're talking about. Go on, get. Go on! Biggest mob trouble-maker, Leonie, rubbish one. You should piss off! Who made you sheriff, old man? You're nothing but a jacky jacky. And that professor there, she your mission manager? - What's going on? - I'll tell you what's going on. This old man's a sell-out. Sold his hole and his people. Hey, look here. Nobody the boss of me. I'm the boss here. You, you got no man. Nobody want you. - You got no kids, you're nothing! - Leonie! - Lock her up! - Youse in your portaloo? - Come on! - You're going to do it, mook-mook? What's your name? - Amos. - Put that rake down, Amos. - Get your hands off me! - Now. - Him. He's the one now. - I'm Sandra. I'm allowed to be here. Professor Sandra Elmquist, Banks University. Detective Jay Swan. Are you a real police officer? Depends. Depends? Depends on what you think a real police officer is. Hear that, rhinestone cowboy? He your captain? I've done the right thing. Consulted with the traditional owners. Received permission from the land council. But you can't please everyone. That piece of paper might talk for your jacky jacky here, but it don't talk for me and it don't talk for my country! And we're back. There you go. That's what I gotta put up with. This dig is of world historical significance. We believe there are artefacts buried here that date back at least 70,000 years. But the big spring tide's around the corner. And if we're not done by then, this will be lost forever. - Leonie's not helping. - I'm onto you. Bring your little Michael Jackson-gloved hands over here and we'll smash. Patterson, if you tap across this line again I'll arrest you. That might not be such a bad thing. Alright. Don't stress. I'm going. All good. Thank you. ...getting their way as usual. Look at her. Look at her over there. Yeah, you'll keep, Amos. What was that all about? It's a sit-down vigil protesting against the dig. Flares up sometimes. I want to check something out. I'll drop you off at the station. ...somebody, and you put, like, a bullet hole? - Did she tell you that? - Did she tell me that? Is it true? I was such a bastard. Oh, my God. I know. It was such an uncommon thing to do. I thought it was fucking funny... Hey. How you going? Can I help ya? Yeah, I was looking for Emilio. Oh, he's long gone, mate. He's 9-to-5. Simon. Jay. I'm like a caretaker. I live at the back here. Do a bit of driving if he needs me. You two know each other? You could say that. Jay is my ex-husband. Small world. Yes. A small world. So what's Emilio done wrong? Who said anything about Emilio doing something wrong? Well, in my experience, unless it's a death knock, why else does a copper come knocking? So when did you get out of the force? Long time ago. Why'd you leave? I needed a less complicated life. Why are you still in? Long story. There's plenty here if you want to join us, mate. Yeah, nah, he's too busy. Yeah, no, I'll pass. Maybe another time. - You alright? - Fuck. I'm sorry. Can you see me? Yeah, I can see you. Oh! I know you... ...and I know you can see me and I know you did it. - You know you did it, don't you? - Which way did he go? Oh. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Oh! It's my cousin. Zoe. Missing. They say she disappeared. You don't think so? No. I was away at boarding school when it happened. Listen. Don't tell your boss what I say to a witness in private. Do you understand? Sorry. Someone here to see you, Detective. Yeah, we've met. Kayla asked me to come and ID the body. Kayla. Yeah, it's him. Bull tattoo. Got it in Kuta. Glad she never saw you like this, mate. He was your source. Yeah. We looked after each other for a while. I left the force. Uh... Didn't see him for... till a couple of years ago. Bumped into him at the pub. He looked good. New family. Kayla and the kids just sorted him out. No more drugs. Did a bit of fishin'. Poor bastard. Who did he hang out with? No-one, really. Kayla told me that she'd kicked him out. But he wouldn't tell me what it was about. You have any idea who may have done this to him? But I'll help you get the pricks. Crazy woman, hey. Get off her! This is my mother's country. Leonie. Leonie! Stop! Stop! Too good there, mook-mook eyes. You want to tell me what's going on? Protecting my land. And my people. Lock her up. Stay here. - Are you alright? - Yeah, yeah. I'm OK. What started all this? All this? That one there now. She started this. Something wrong with her head. Digging up family! They breaking the law. You should arrest them. We are trying to rewrite history. Your history! - And you're destroying it all. - I know my history. I don't need you or anyone else trying to dig it up, write about it or put it in a museum. This is your country too. Which law do you stand for? You're under arrest. - Put your hands behind your back. - Are you gonna do this? Put your hands behind your back! Yep. Good job. Good job. Get now. What's going on here? What's happening with this girl? Leonie?! Hey! Step back. There's a chair there. Sit. I suggest you sit back down on the seat now. What now, Detective? Causing trouble. Allegedly. Come on, you. What are you doing? That was Professor Elmquist on the phone. She doesn't want to press charges. Yeah, but we can. You can't arrest your sister, Franny. And let's not mention you discharging your firearm. Told you, Detective. Allegedly. See you at home, mook-mook eyes. Love your guts. Oh, fuck. How are you, Jay? Good. You? I'm really good. How long are you hanging around? Depends. On what? My work. Yeah, I should've guessed. Why didn't you tell me about Crystal? What about Crystal? I got a message from her. You could've told me she was going away. Oh, you got some cheek, fella. Oh, so now you come back here to start being a dad again, have ya? What about a month ago? What about six months ago? What about when you brought Crystal back from Patterson a year ago? And then you disappeared. Like you've been doing for 20 years, Jay. Shame job. Yeah, shame job. You still could have told me. Did you ring her? You gotta earn the right to be a father, Jay. Can't just demand it when it suits you. - Who's your friend? - Oh, really? You wanna go there? Are you a little bit jealous, Jay? Well? His mother's a patient. That's how we met. - He's very funny. He makes me laugh. - That's none of my business. You're right, it's none of your fucking business! I'm settled, Jay. I'm happy. You've got no idea how hard it was to get out of that place. But I did it. I came here for a fresh start - no baggage. And for the first time in a really long, long time, I can see where I'm goin'. And I like it. And I want to hold onto that feeling. I like that feeling. And I don't want you here to fuck it up. I've been holding onto some of your shit in case you ever showed up. So why did you run? Only guilty people run. Innocent till proven guilty. We can do this all day if you like. Unless you want to tell me what happened to Clarrie Stewart. Not my problem, Detective. - Thought he was your mate. - Hardly knew him. I heard you threatened him. That's a load of bullshit. I helped him out, I got him a job. - And why would you do that? - 'Cause he was a mate. I thought you said he wasn't your mate. I've got you for evading police and now I've got you for possession. You know, Clarrie was found with drugs jammed down his throat. So why do you think someone would do that? - You're the detective. - It's a warning. They wanted Clarrie to be found. Say all you like. I didn't cut his head off. Who said anything about Clarrie having his head chopped off? You did. Face the wall. Kick your shoes off. Turn around. Back up. Come on, you little runamoks. What's the worst thing you've ever done, Detective? - Hey. - A few weeks won't matter, will it? - What are they? - Trust me.
