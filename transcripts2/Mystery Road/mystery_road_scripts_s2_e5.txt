 Get away from her! Do you know who you're talking to? You don't talk for me. Took the bones of my great-great grandfather. Sent him off to your university to bag, tag and display. So you want repatriation? It was my mother's final wish. I can protect you, if you tell me who you're working for. The prelim ID on the bones says they're not Zoe Mead. They're male. Hey, do you know if Zoe was seeing anyone? She was seeing Buddy Nolan. Who? I'll admit, I was surprised to see you

 caught in a shooting with Declan James. Goes under Simon Rowland now. Left the force under a cloud. This is your place, isn't it? I was a cop for 19 years, and I walked away with nothing. So you went and got yourself something. (RATTLING) Sorry. I didn't mean that. Fuck!

Come on, please. I gotta go. Look... look... (STARTS ENGINE) I'm sorry! Fuck. MARY: I don't know the details, but whatever he's doing, there's some serious money involved. And, like, the way he was talking, it's like he's got something big on. That makes sense. That's why he got close to you, 'cause he knows I'm after him. Except I met him before you came to town. He's never asked about YOU. Mary. It's not your fault. That's the way these men operate. They... they manipulate people. You're not safe, especially after tonight. Simon wouldn't hurt me. You don't know him! He let you go for a reason! 'Cause you're bait! Oh, to catch big Jay Swan! Why don't you swallow your pride and be smart? Leave the police work to me! And stay safe! Do you know how many times I've heard you say that? "Oh, you're not safe, Mary. "Go on, go, Mary." Do you know the one thing in common? It's you. It's not Simon bringing darkness into my life. It's you. You're like a fuckin' magnet. You're the reason why I can't catch a break. You're the reason why your daughter is gone! You're the one who should be running, not me. Because you can't live with the living. (KEYS RATTLE) (PANTS) Fuck! (ENGINE STARTS) Bye, Mummy. Bye, Mum, bye. SHEVORNE: We need to go to the cops. I told Jay I'd make an official statement. (SIGHS) Once Simon finds out what we did... Look, it's the only safe place to be. Can look after myself. I know you can. (SIGHS) I don't think you know what Simon does to the people that cross him. He's got eyes everywhere. Then we have no choice. WOMAN: Do you want to go there, switching sides? (PEOPLE JEER) You mob don't know what you're talking about! I really... (SIGHS) ..I appreciate that you are doing this. Yeah, we'll see. (BIRDS SQUAWK) (PHONE KEYBOARD CLICKS) (RECIPIENT'S PHONE RINGS) (PHONE BUZZES) MARY: Hi. SIMON: Hey. Look, I'm sorry. It was a bit of a shock, you know. I didn't know what to do. Kept thinking, "He's lied to me. "He's been lying to me this whole time." I didn't lie. Yeah, you just wanted to get close to my ex. What?! Mary, I didn't know about Jay. I had no idea. How can I believe you? (SIGHS) I had no idea. All I knew was... that first time I was with you, is, "Here's a beautiful, intelligent girl "that I want to get to know better." I don't know what's true. All I know is I'm feeling a bit used. A bit stupid. MARY: You know what? I got a break at 11. Meet me there or you don't. If you don't, well... You know what the truth is? I hadn't liked anyone since Jay. But with you... (ENDS CALL) (CAR LOCKING CLICKS) (DOOR OPENS) Oh, sorry! MARY: Alright, you mob. Come on, line up. Come on. Hey, Uncle, it's linedancing, not dirty dancing. What's the use? Oh, you cheeky fella. Come on. Hands on your hips. That's it. Watch her. (LINEDANCING SONG PLAYS) And... go back. That's it. You got it. Deadly, yeah? Uh-huh? Uh-huh? (LAUGHS) Go back, go back. Yeah, deadly. You got it! Here comes Prince Charming! (INDISTINCT CHATTER) You're a bit early. Is that OK? Yeah. Last thing I want to do is scare you off. Um, let's go this way. (LAUGHTER) (COUGHS) (PHONE BUZZES) JAY: Anything? There's no sign of him coming in this way. Nothing here either. Stay alert. Copy that. (SIGHS) Thank you. (MARY SIGHS) I'm surprised you even showed. I didn't want things to end like that. I told you the truth because I want us to have a future together. (SIGHS) You don't really know me. I know enough. Nah. Nah, I got darkness too. I know. Only difference is, only person I hurt's myself. See, I saw who you really were at dinner. When you grabbed my arm, I saw... No, that's just... How can I just ignore that? I could have killed Jay 20 times, but I didn't because of you. Is that right? Is it just him? What? Is it just Jay or does he have backup? How'd you get in here? Declan James! Put your hands where I can see them... ..or I'll put you down. You're not gonna start a shootout in a hospital, are you, Detective? Remove the gun slowly and put it on the ground, or I'll put you down. You seen Mary? (ALARM BLARES) She's losing a lot of blood. MAN: No, Jay! Think about that, Jay. No! WOMAN: Security. Security alert, Ward B. Don't push it, OK? Go check on Mary. Get out of here. Go check on Mary. Go on! (ALARM BLARES) Bub! Are you alright? Did he hurt you? Where were you? There's a roadhouse outside of Palmer's Cove, the Export Motel. You'll be safe there, Mary. (RUNNING FOOTSTEPS APPROACH) Mate, he's gone. Don't worry. I'll get him. (BREATHES SHAKILY) See this? Here. Ochre. Probably mixed with animal fat. That's how it stayed put all these years. Yeah, we still do the same thing when we prepare our people's bones for reburial. Our culture is alive. Yes, but it's been watered down since the European arrival. Wouldn't say that. But you do have a lot to answer for. SANDRA: The, um, museum board is having a meeting tomorrow. They have agreed to consider repatriation. That's fast. My people have been trying for years and never got nowhere. Well... ..sometimes you just need your very own whitefella on the case. You said it, not me. Yeah. Probably helped that I promised to share all our findings from the dig site. I can't tell you how important this dig site is. Keeping this dig open might have been worth all the headache. Just need our people back on country. (PHONE BUZZES) Constable Davis. Thank you. (SIGHS) (PHONE CLATTERS) The dental records show a match for Buddy Nolan. (PICKS UP KEYS) Gotta notify next of kin. We're focused on Simon. They've waited long enough. (DOOR OPENS) (DOOR CLOSES) Mary said that Simon had something big on. A shipment? That's what I'm thinking. The pearl farm's the link to it all. Bodies turn up there. And a witness saw a fisherman being bashed. Right. So if you find your fisherman, you find that link. Yeah. You hardworking detectives need anything? No. You? No. I'm good. Straight through. PEARCE: Who the fuck are these bozos? Alkemi. We're friends of a friend. Heard you need some help with a policing matter. I can handle the detective. Our mate didn't mention you blokes. In some cultures, you'll eat with one hand and wipe your arse with the other. Long as each hand's doing its job, what's the problem? MAN: Chill. We come as friends. (WATER SPLASHES) I heard a fisherman copped a beating a couple of nights ago. You heard talk about that? I just want to know about the drugs. I don't think you're directly involved. But I do think you know who is. The same one that gave you that beating. You from Timor? No crabs in Timor? WAYAN: Used to be. 10 years ago, big oil spill. Montara platform. 2,000 barrels a day into the ocean. Company said it was all cleaned up, but... ..you can smell the oil from here. No more fish for us. No more crab. Gone. We complain. Border Forces burn our boats. Call us people smuggler. Made you angry? I know all the fish are dead. People have still got to eat. Good fishermen know all the spots. All the good spots. All the secret spots. Is that how you help? Who do you help, Wayan? (WATER SPLASHES) (PHONE BEEPS) Phillip. What? Go inside. What's happening? Listen. Go now. Go! Hey, girl, what you doing out there? Come inside. Here, have a seat. How are you, girl? Got bad news. I'm sorry. We found your nephew's remains. I'm sorry for your loss. (SIGHS) (SNIFFS) (YELLS) Do you want a lift to the airport? Don't want you to be late. Oh. SHEVORNE: Phillip! That pig Jay Swan bashed me. What?! Phillip! I want to press charges. Please don't do this. Took me out bush, flogged me, left me for dead. Why are you doing this? OWEN: Hey! If you're not gonna let him speak, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave, alright? But he's lying! OWEN: OK. Come on. Come on. Simon put you up to it. Didn't he? It was Jay Swan. He bashed me. He told me if I said anything, he'd kill me. OK. I'll take your statement. Grab the first aid kit. OWEN: Alright. Calm down. Calm down. (CHATTER IN DISTANCE) Must be difficult for you. To be over here with me and... ..not over there with them. Difficult on that side too. Making hard decisions. Ones that are best for community don't always win you many friends. Know what you mean. My wife, she... ..she left me just a couple of months before I got up here. Said my work was more important to me than... Yeah, well. (SIGHS) Sorry. Ah. Don't be. She was right. (BOTH LAUGH) WOMAN: What else you gonna do? What else? My mother went to her grave trying to get our ancestors back. I don't want to do the same. I promise I'll do whatever I can to make that happen. Put things right at last. (SNIFFS) (DOOR BANGS) What do you know about Alkemi and the yaba, Owen? Detective Swan, I'm informing you you're under arrest. I'm gonna need your badge and your gun. What is this? What are you playing at? Are you refusing to give me your badge and your gun? Jay. Been a serious complaint made against you. Until we've looked into it, you have to hand over your weapon. (PHONE RINGS IN BACKGROUND) What complaint? Assault. Who was it? You'll be stood down until this is resolved. You'll need legal representation. Who was it? This is a set-up. Come on. Jay. Your weapon. Come on. (PUTS KEYS ON DESK) You're being played. Gonna need your phone too. Come on. If anything happens to Mary, I'm holding you responsible. Stay in here. (KNOCKING) Where have you been? At the station. It's all gone wrong. SHEVORNE: Everything's gone wrong! MARY: We gotta go. Now! Get the bags. Tell me in the car. (SIREN CHIRPS) Hey, I need to speak to you. Again, mook-mook? Haven't we been over all this? I want to know about the bones that were found at the church. Told you already. What good is bringing up all this sadness again? It's not Zoe. It's Buddy Nolan. Buddy from Nine Mile? Do you remember him? Not really. He was nothing special. What does that mean? Oh, it's not Christian to say. But I've seen too many boys like Buddy. Gammon gangsters, selling drugs, acting like they're big men, but they all boys. They got no culture. They don't know about men's business, or women's business. Did you know he was seeing Zoe? I don't know anything about that. That poor boy. Did Amos say anything about him? Why would he? You asked your sister what she knows? She's the one running around with that boy now. (DOOR OPENS) FRAN: Alright, Leonie. When was the last time you saw Buddy Nolan? What? You heard me. Why are you asking? Answer the question! When was it? I don't know. Probably at the shops. Him and Zoe. Holding hands. Trying to hide it, but not good. Everyone could see. That make you angry? (PUTS GLASS DOWN) What for? 'Cause you were seeing him too? He's a boy. Who been talking shit about me? I know you know more than you're saying. People that did this are still alive. I'm trying to protect you. Who are they? (PICKS UP ICE) Leonie! (DOOR OPENS) (DOOR SLAMS) (FOOTSTEPS RECEDE) (DOOR OPENS) It's a young bloke, Phillip Mead. Said you bashed him and threatened his life. When was this? An hour ago. The Mead boy's a drug runner for Rowland. We've been looking at him as part of this investigation. Constable Davis can confirm that. Phillip's a good kid, but Simon got to him. OK. So there's nothing to this? What, he just injured himself? Or one of Rowland's mates helped. Do what you gotta do, but I'm innocent. Yeah, OK. I had to take this seriously. You've had other complaints. And... the sergeant certainly jumped on it quickly. Yeah, almost like he knew to expect it. Owen's a dirty cop. But this here? It's got Rowland's name all over it. To get me out of the way. Listen, I gotta be on a flight today, so... ..if you give me a couple of days, I'll come back with a team and we can move on him together. That's if Simon Rowland doesn't move first. No. Be smart. Don't go after him yourself. (PHONE BUZZES) It's Jay. Hello? OWEN: Where are you? Halfway to the roadhouse. Past Daby's Point. Who is this? It's Sergeant Cross, Shevorne. Look, there's been, uh, an accident. Jay's not in a good way. Is Mary there? Jay's been in an accident? Hello? Mary. Uh, look, Jay's stable, but it is serious. How far from town are you? Look, I can come and, uh, pick you up if you're too upset to drive. I just need to know your location. You want to know where we are? Yeah. Like, right now? It's an emergency, Mary. Mary. (PHONE CLATTERS) (SIGHS) FRAN: Phillip's lying. I can't believe you arrested him. No-one's above the law, Franny. What happened to you, Owen? You just want to stick your head in the sand, like everybody else in this town? Hope shit goes away? Doesn't work like that. I got careful, Fran, OK? Something I think you could learn to be. FRAN: Jay. Fuck. (GROANS) Sergeant, give me the keys to the desk. (PANTS) He assaulted me! You saw it. I had my back turned. Detective Swan's gonna need his gun back. You're not my boss. Till I hear from my super, I'm not gonna lift a finger to help you. What are you gonna do with that? I'm going to check on Mary. Will you help me with something first? Make it quick. Who the fuck are those guys at my place? The muppets with the rifles, talking about shooting coppers! They ARE cops. Were. And I sent for them, so... don't worry. I'm not worried. I'm finished. Your shipment, done. Tony... You were supposed to deal with the police. That's the only reason you're part of this. And I am dealing with 'em. That black cop's in a cell. And once he gets out... I don't give a shit. It's over! OK. My mistake. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done that. I should have told you. But these are good, solid guys. You want 'em on your side. They're jokers. Like you. You pull out now, a lot of people are gonna be unhappy. Lot of people are already unhappy. You beat up Wayan. Do you know how that makes me look, in the villages? Be an almighty shit fight to get that factory working again. My reputation's trashed! Who cares about that? I gave them my word! Anyway... ..I cancelled the flight. That's gonna get us all killed. (LAUGHS) You trying to spook me? No! My first tour overseas, we only stopped firing to reload. We just rolled 'em up. It was all blood. You know, I've... ..I've seen things and done things that I'm gonna have to pay for. Shit you would never understand. Fuck off, then. And you tell those villagers of yours they just walked away from $5 million! Hey, mate, stop. I fucked up. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done that. Hey. Just... come and have a beer. You want a beer? Just... let me make this right for you. I'm sorry. OK? PEARCE: Oh, fuck it. I'll have a beer. You're right. We should be careful. We gotta stick together. 50? 100. (SIGHS) (GRUNTS) (YELLS) (PANTS) I understand blood, arsehole. Get rid of it. Call the pilot. Tell him we're back on. PANSY: ♪ Hold thou thy cross ♪ Before my closing eyes ♪ Shine through the gloom ♪ And point me to the skies ♪ Heaven's morning breaks ♪ And earth's vain shadows flee ♪ In life, in death, O Lord ♪ Abide with me. ♪ TOM: Thank you, all. Go in peace to love and serve the Lord. Where is everyone? Please, tell me. The bones. Shall I arrange to have the church smoked? No, that won't help. They think... What? What? That I had something to do with it? Oh! You know I didn't. I'm sorry. (INSECTS BUZZ) (VEHICLE APPROACHES) (VEHICLE DOORS OPEN) I know everybody thinks I hurt them kids, but I didn't. I wish I could believe you. Your promised wife was having an affair with another man and you expect us to believe that you did nothing about it? What do you want me to say? That I took 'em out bush and killed 'em? (DOOR CLOSES) I loved that boy. Suppose I should have done something about it. AMOS: What am I gonna do? FRAN: What DID you do? AMOS: I dropped them at the truck stop there... ..so they could get out of town. That's a lie. We found his body, and it's only a matter of time before we find Zoe's. I told you. I dropped them at the truck stop. And that was the last time you saw them? Mmm. FRAN: So who else knew they went to the truck stop? (ENGINE STOPS) Why aren't we taking him in? You didn't believe any of that, did you? We'll let him stew for a bit and see what we can see. (VEHICLE DOOR CLOSES) (ENGINE STARTS) (VEHICLE DOOR CLOSES) AMOS: That detective come to my place there, look, with Fran. They was asking questions. Our country has law for everything. For marriage. For cooking this kangaroo. But it takes a strong man to follow Aboriginal law. Everyone's so worried about white law. (VEHICLE APPROACHES) (ENGINE STOPS) (VEHICLE DOORS OPEN) Interesting, Amos, that we should find you here. Why is that? Why does he keep looking at you, eh? Does he do everything that you say? You see them trees out there? See them rocks? That water? That's me. We're one. Where's your tree? (SCOFFS) Poor thing. You think that badge is your law, eh? You got a nice place here. Where'd you get it? You're not listening. I'm listening. You're not listening hard enough, boy. This place IS me. Why you call me boy? Because you're not a man. How do I become a man? Law makes you a man. Who gave YOU the law? Can you tell me what makes a man, Amos? I know you want to tell me, but you can't, because of him. What's he got over you? What'd he make you do? Our law tells us when the salmon's running. When to burn the land. How to marry right way. Zoe and Buddy, wrong way? They broke the law. They were running around, right in front of your face. Disrespecting you. Shame job. Eh, Amos? So you gotta do something about it. You had to stand up for yourself. Stand up for your community. Well, that's what Jimmy says. If there's no law, then everything just falls apart. Did he make you do it? He make you hurt those kids? The problem with you saltwater people is you think the tide'll wash away all your sins. I didn't make him do anything. He didn't have the balls. They knew what was coming. What was coming? Come on. You been telling me you're the big boss. Don't go silent. Come on. Don't hide behind Amos. Is Amos the big boss man, is he? Is he? So, what was coming? What? Come on, what? Me! I killed that boy. JIMMY 2: I'll answer to MY law, to my people. White law means nothing. FRAN: What you did wasn't law, Jimmy. It was murder. That's why you kept it a secret. It was no secret. You think no-one knew? They all knew. It's law. And no-one questions it. (PANTS) They all knew about Buddy and Zoe. Everyone knew. (KEYS RATTLE) (HORN HONKS) Fuck! (SOBS) (SOBBING CONTINUES) (HANDBRAKE CLICKS) (KEYS RATTLE) Hello. Thank you for coming to see me. Will you come inside? No, I'm fine. What's all this about? Sandra. I know it was you who left the bones here on the church steps. That's ridiculous. I saw your car drive away. It was you. And it's you who has to tell the community. (SIGHS) I can help. Please. No-one will ever trust me again. I'll lose everything. I'm sorry, but if you can't tell them, I will. I'll pray for you. You'll pray for me? I'll pray for you. (SIGHS) (SPRINKER SPRAYS) Hey. We're here. Look, hurry up, eh? I'm not sure, but I think someone's following us. JAY: Lock the door. I'm leaving soon. OK, good. Jay's on his way. Let's get a room. (SIGHS) (DIAL TONE) (BEEPING) (RECIPIENT'S PHONE RINGS) (CALL CONNECTS) Roadhouse. Palmer's Cove. Must be the Export. (SIGHS) (TV PLAYS INDISTINCTLY) (BEEPING) (BEEPING) (DOOR OPENS) (DOOR CLOSES) (BEEPING) (FAN STOPS) (SPRINKLER SPRAYS) (COINS CLINK AND RATTLE) (VEHICLE PULLS UP) (VEHICLE DOORS OPEN) (VEHICLE DOORS CLOSE) (FOOTSTEPS APPROACH) That's not our culture, Jimmy. That's murder. And Zoe? What did you do to her? People say, "He knew all this time. "He looked us in the eye and lied." They'll never trust you again. (GUNFIRE) Get it working now.
