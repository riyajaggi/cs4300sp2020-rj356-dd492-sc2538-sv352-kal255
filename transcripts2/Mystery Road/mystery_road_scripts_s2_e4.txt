 Saw Clarrie Tuesday night, in the bushes down near the waterhole. Can I speak to your partner that you were with that night? He wasn't my partner. We're shutting you down, woman. Oh, no, you can't. Please give them back. That's blackfella business. I reckon these'd be better to stay on country, where they belong. You don't want me to take because there's more down there. Is that it? I may not have been the best cop, but I know where I'd look first. Hey, hold on, cowboy. These are serious people, mate. You need backup.

 ♪ Shake this shadow ♪ It's too dark... ♪ ♪ It's too dark ♪ It's too dark ♪ To shake this shadow. ♪ I told you this was finished! You know what you know. And I know what I know. Zoe used to tell me she'd pray to be invisible. Why would she do that? I don't know. The only reason a person would want to be invisible is to hide from something. Or someone. I've already told you everything I know about Zoe. It was so long ago. Why did you become a minister? When I heard the Word of Jesus, I knew it was the truth and that I'd spend my life spreading that truth. And was it the Word of Jesus to round up all the blackfellas? Put 'em on missions? Deny our culture? Take our kids away? The wrongs of the past are terrible. But suffering, even great suffering, is temporary. God's love is permanent. So God won't abandon us? But when a black kid goes missing in a rural town, where's God been for the last decade? Oh, I prayed the bones weren't Zoe's, I did. Your prayers? Zoe held onto that cross. And she prayed for someone to answer her. And nobody, not even your God, answered. He just sits up there and says nothing. She talked about a boy. Uh, I don't know... ...I... I honestly don't know who. But I could tell she was afraid. Of him? I don't know any more. Hey! Get in. Phillip! Get out of the car! What you gonna do, shoot me? Get on the ground now. Shoot me! Get on the ground now! I'm right here! Shoot me! Go on, shoot me! I said inside! Come on, cuz. On the ground. When should I let him go? When he proves that he's not a threat to himself. He's hurting, Jay. First thing you do is keep him breathing. "I pulled over to make a phone call. "I heard several bangs in the factory. "I went inside, where Emilio Gordon pointed a gun at me. "I was in fear for my life "when Detective Swan arrived and shot Emilio Gordon." Does that sound right? You did the world a favour. He was a mate. And I shot him in the back. Yeah, a mate who leaves headless bodies around. Consider yourself lucky. Look. Go over it again. You need to get the statement down. Detective Swan. You wanted to see me? Yeah. Just got word that a critical incident officer's being flown up. He's gonna be taking statements tomorrow. OK. You need to say that you shot Emilio Gordon. You're joking, right? It was an execution of your duties. Saving a civilian's life. Look, we can just tell them what happened and I'll cop it sweet. Yeah, then Detective Swan would have to admit that he dropped his service revolver and that you used it to kill someone. He'd be out on his arse quicker than shit off a shovel, and you... ...you'd be in jail waiting till they investigate. No-one needs that. I'll do it if you're alright with it. I'll think about it. Everything OK? Hey, I'm still waiting on an ID on them bones from the coroner. They're giving me the run-around. Been talking to this one, that one, this one. Well, tell 'em it's from Bosco. Bosco? You do that and you meet me in the car. ♪ I've been working ♪ All through the day ♪ I been thinking about ♪ Your special way ♪ My love for you, baby ♪ Will save me... ♪ You only ever get on the charge when Jimmy 2 comes round. He's no good, that fella. So, what, that's it? You just gonna let people walk all over you? Nobody walks over me. Oh, "Nobody walks over me." True God. You let him. You let that white woman. She's still at the dig site. Look at you. When are you gonna stand up? ♪ I feel for you, baby ♪ Makes me feel good deep down inside ♪ I'm waiting... ♪ What are we doing back here? Are you with him? Who? Owen. Since I've been here, I've been pushed in one direction. Like somebody doesn't want me looking any other way. And the one person standing in my view... ...is your boss. So, what are you trying to say? I'm gonna ask you again. Are you with him? No. And I don't have to prove myself to you. I took this job because black women go missing and men who think they're cowboys are too busy having pissing contests to give a shit. I don't care about Owen, or you. I'm doing my job. I've been told to say that I shot Emilio Gordon. Your boss wants me out of town. So you gonna say you did it? So you're the dirty cop. You're the one lying. Suzi-John said that she saw two men bashing Clarrie. Dylan and another man. Someone that she's too scared to name. Emilio. Everybody wants it to be Emilio. But Owen was on that night too. Yeah, but he was on duty. Oh, you were with him, were you? No, but... If anything happens to me... ...I want you to look out for Mary. And Shevorne. Will you do that? Tell me what you see. A meth lab? Now tell me what you don't see. No pill presser. No yaba. Oh, it's the lab. Yeah. Yeah, for Bosco. I'll tell Detective Swan you say hello. You could? Prelim results is fine. What? Yeah. Bit full-on. Mmm. So Jay's gonna say I had the gun pointed at me and HE took the shot. Jay's gonna cover for YOU? Yeah. He's a good bloke, Jay. So this whole thing's got me thinking, yeah? Yeah. Life's too short. And... I don't want to muck around anymore, 'cause I like you, Mary. I really like you. And I want to take you somewhere special. What are you thinking? I know a place. And I think you'll like it. OK. Sure. Yeah? Good. I gotta go to work. OK. I'll see you later. Yep. Alright. The prelim ID on the bones says they're not Zoe Mead. They're male. How'd you get the test back so fast? Well, I was hoping Detective Swan could help me on the case. Detective Swan shouldn't even be here any longer. I have a few things to clear up. I need to talk to Phillip in the lock-up. I let him go. What?! He was no longer a danger to himself, and if I kept him here any longer, you'd have been in trouble, Franny. Bullshit! I've tolerated your attitude so far. But you're on thin ice, Detective. This is my station. You can go back to your motel. Sit down, Constable! Mary. Yeah. You had a gun pointed at your head? Your boyfriend been talking? I've actually come here to check on you. Oh, forget it. I'm not convinced the man that we got is the man that's behind all this. Why do you think that? It's just a feeling. Right. And... and how does that stack up in a court of law? 'Cause I thought they actually needed evidence. Why can't you just be happy you did your job and you didn't get killed? If you keep chasing death, Jay... ...one day, you'll get it. It's not that simple. I'm just gonna go and see Doug at the gun club. Some idiot broke that back gate again. Look, Franny... ...I know you wanted this to be Zoe, but... Boss. Forgot my phone. So he leaves here. And then he comes back here. Well, that fits the time frame for when Suzi-John saw two fellas with Clarrie. You keep this quiet, OK? Alright? Yeah. Have you seen Phillip? Not since this morning. He's not home? I haven't told him the bones aren't Zoe's yet. Any idea who it is? Nothing, but look at this. They knew each other? I can't believe Owen's a murderer. Cross one line, you can cross others. Hey, you mob! Amos! Stop. Stop. Amos, what are you doing? Please, can you stop this?! Amos. What wrong with you? I told you, this place, shut down. You don't understand. Amos. Amos, listen to me. You don't understand! Hey, hey. YOU don't understand. I'm the boss for this one here, and I'm hunting you out. Amos, you're making a big mistake here. I found it. The plastic bag. What bag?! Hey! You want to be big boss, hey? Hey?! Go on! That's enough! Enough. Enough! Get away from her! You mind your own business. Get away from her. Do you know who you're talking to? I know who you are. You don't talk for me. Come on. Let's go. But I... I... Let's go! OK. Shevorne. A word. You see Phillip around? No. Thought you two were... Not anymore. And he chucked in his job. Since when? This week. Well, if you see Phillip around, you let me know, OK? What, so you can lock him up again? ...fuck is your problem? You can't even... you can't even fuckin' listen... You need to grow up. You need to fuckin' man up. You know what? Just fuckin' behave yourself. Fuckin' make it easy, you fuck! I don't have a problem. Hey, Dad. Hello, daughter girl. Making friends, mookie. You should try it. Shoulda known. You look like you've had a full-on day. The bones weren't Zoe's. Poor thing. Bones of a young person were found in a bag at the front of church. Do you know who they belong to? I'm not sure. Hey, do you know if Zoe was seeing anyone? She have a boyfriend? Any male friends she was hanging out with? She was seeing Buddy Nolan. Who? Buddy Nolan. How old were these bones? The coroner said 15 years. I think they've been buried 15 years. So sad, just... ...left in a bag like that. We're blackfellas. We're used to it. Yeah, but it doesn't mean it can't change. Yeah, and who gonna listen? There are still allies out there. And you know who left the bones at the church? Not yet. Hey, sis. Coming to the pub? Nah. I'll see youse later, eh? Hey, now, Dad. Cup of tea outside for you. Mmm. So it's really over, then? Yeah. With no permission from the community, the university can't support my funding, so... ...just wasted three years. But I did appreciate the drink last night. It was really nice to talk to somebody. And to meet Mervyn. Nice meeting you too. Going now. Hey, don't pack up too fast. I got a proposal. Yeah? In the '20s, English archaeologists collected bones from our burial sites for their bullshit studies. Took the bones of my great-great-grandfather. Sent him off to your university to bag, tag and display. Now they consider him their property. So you... want repatriation? It was my mother's final wish. And you'd know. All them books you write about us. Our dead can't rest until their bones are returned to country. And if I can do that, you'll give me permission? We're similar. We're fighters. You want to call that allies, you can call it that. Feeding my ego. There's just one problem. Jimmy 2 want to play that cultural card... ...let him play it. So, what'd Lenna do for her show-and-tell, then? She bring in her, um, dolls. Oh! What, like them... ...unicorn dolls? No, um, her Barbie dolls. Oh, her Barbie dolls. Yeah, right. What are you gonna do, then? I'm going to bring in the shells. That's a good idea. We... Mummy! Oh, baby. Where you been? Overtime. Oh! All night overtime, eh? You can't pick up your phone overtime? Time for school, Ava. It's alright. I'll walk with her. Let's go. See ya. Shite. You walk ahead, bub. Hi. You've done it? I need more time. Shevorne, listen to me. It's just one phone call. You care about Ava, don't you? Leave my daughter out of this. They just want to talk to him, that's it! Just stay away from me! So, yes, here. We stand here now. And I started to dig here. Where you gonna go next? Uh, I think we are continuing here, since I found the grindstone there. Mm-hm. But further down... How much she paying you off? Not a damn thing. The elders have elected for payment to go to community project instead of any individuals. They will also be co-authors on any findings. Elders? Big cultural woman now, eh? This is a sacred woman's site. Or did you forget that? And since this is a woman's site, you can fuck right off. You OK? Hello? Hey, Jay. Hm? I need your help. Shevorne! - Phillip. - Hey! Yeah, brother, you want to slow down, huh? A roundabout, brah. Slow down. I want to tell you something! Hey! Hey! Hey, hey! You're gonna hurt someone! Stay there! Get out of the way. Huh? Huh? Hey? Huh? Get the fuck off me! Come on. Oh! Fucking get off me! Get up. Get up. Now... Hey! Get off me. Get off me, you dog! Ah! Get off me! Help! Someone help me! What do you need help for? You! What am I gonna do? You tell me about the yaba and then you can go and do whatever it is that you want to go and do. I'm not tellin' you nothin'! Well, then I'll just wait. Someone help me! Help me, someone! Help! Help! Help's right here. Right here. Hey, fella. We've got about 10 minutes in these bloody shoes. Wow. You ready to talk yet? Why you doin' this to me? You're doing this to yourself. I want to die. I want to end this. Just fuckin' let me die! Why? You want more hurt? You want to give your family more pain? You don't understand. You don't know shit! Why don't you tell me... ...what it is that I don't understand? Hey? Tell me. That when you lay down at night... ...waiting to sleep... ...and when it finally comes... ...you hope you don't wake up? But you lie there staring up at the light that's coming through the window. And it's still there. What's still there? Life. When I was eight... ...when Zoe was gone... ...I used to look for her every night. I'm still looking. When I close my eyes, all I see is my sister, my mother, crying. Just want to switch it off. You want to be mourned? Is that what you want? All your brother boys gathering round, having a charge. And then what? Doesn't matter what. It does matter. Your family carry the pain. Community. They wear the scars. ♪ There's no girl at the cabin door ♪ There's no shelter at the bus stop ♪ There's nothing out there no more... ♪ Whoa! Shit! Whose place is this? It's a mate's. He let me have it for the weekend. I'm impressed. Good. That was the plan. Um, one second. Hey! Right. I'm scared. I CAN protect you. I know people have lied to you before, but I'm not lying to you now. But the only way I can help you... ...is if you tell me who you're working for. Detective Swan. You're a hard man to find. Can this wait until tomorrow? No. Already got a statement from the sergeant about the shooting, so just got one question for you. Is that the truth? Where'd they drag you in from? Internal Affairs? Is it the truth? No. Makes sense. I'll admit, I was surprised to see you caught in a shooting with Declan James. Who? Declan James. Goes under Simon Rowland now. Left the force under a cloud. Went off the radar until now. Why'd he leave? Word is he was about to be caught in a drug importation sting. Resigned the week before the bust. He shot Emilio Gordon. Not me. Do you think I'm stupid? What? This is your place, isn't it? It's why I brought you here. Jesus! What are you thinking? I'm thinking... ...where does an ex-cop get all this money? I'm thinking that... ...maybe I don't want to know the answer. Does it matter? One weekend in six, I'm away for business. And in a week's time, I'll have enough for that to be over as well. There'll be nothing TO know. If I don't ask questions. Did Jay tell you what he did when he went to work? The lines he had to cross? Did way worse as a cop than anything now. That's different. Is it? You slept beside Jay every night and you could because you didn't ask and he didn't tell. I was a cop for 19 years. I got spat on, abused, beaten. And I gave and lost everything to that job. And when I got out, the force just... ...turned their back on me, and I walked away with nothing. So you went and got yourself something. Do you believe in second chances? You deserve this, Mary. I don't... Sorry. I didn't mean that. I... It's OK. It's OK. I... It's OK. Yeah? Um, where's the bathroom in this castle of yours? It's, um... ...down the hallway, through the bedroom. OK.
