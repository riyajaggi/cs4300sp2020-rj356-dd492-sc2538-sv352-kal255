 hurt anymore. No, I'll lose you. I'll archive them, - then. - You can retrieve them. - If necessary. - No, please don't. - Please... Pause. Replay. Go now. Start over. You are the new mother of humanity. Save us. Exit memory archive. He seems happy. I've been thinking about what we're gonna tell him whenever - we get him back. - I'm gonna. - Tell him the truth, - That's what. - I'm gonna tell him. Alright, Caleb. Yeah, how's that gonna go? - "Hey, buddy, - so we shot your mom and dad. And then we spent 13 years lying to your face about it. - But you know what? - "We sure do love you." I'll tell him once we reach the tropical zone. You want him - to stay with us. 'Cause he doesn't have any other choice? Yeah. Yeah, no, Caleb, - I get it. - This must be really hard. - For you... - You know, the idea. - Of raising a son when... Don't start this crap. I love him just as much as you do. Run! Run, run, run! - We could just get him. - Right now. - Say we grab him right now. - Then what? - She's just gonna come after us. - Tomorrow. And the next day and the day after that. We gotta destroy her. Or we're never gonna be safe. She takes the same flight path every day. Comes home over that damn mountain. I'm gonna find out where she's going. Did you encounter anything on your patrol today? Nothing of note. Are you certain? - You were gone. - For quite some time. Was there a need - for me? - The creatures are inactive. - During the day... No, no urgent need. - But your prolonged absences. - Sometimes cause me. - To cycle through. - Various scenarios... Where I have to hypothesize the nature of your activities. Perhaps I should start patrolling while you remain here with the children. - I fear you're not spending. - Enough time with them... Not properly imprinting. If you could fly, Father. But on foot, it'll take you all day to perform the task. Yes, that is true. But I will try and spend more time with the children. And perhaps with me, as well... I've fashioned a new joke. When is a door - not a door? When it is a jar. - A door is always a door, - Father. If our private conversations interest you, Hunter, don't strain your ears. Come join us next time. I didn't... I-I... I'm s... I'm sorry. That's a nice doll you got there, Vita. You make it yourself? Tally taught me. Tally? The girl who used to sleep in my bed. You shouldn't talk about her, Vita. She's dead. There you are. It's bedtime. Father is - looking for you. ["Twinkle, Twinkle, Are you feeling positive about your baby today? No matter how many times you ask me that question, the answer's always gonna be the same. Then I'll have to ask you to reaffirm your promise to me. I promise I'm not gonna try and kill myself or the baby. Thank you. Now put that away. You need to sleep. When I figure out - this song. - Nightmares are only thoughts, - Tempest. They're not real. Not what I see. What I see really happened. - And every time. - I close my eyes, - It feels like. - It's happening to me again. But what would you know? You don't even have nightmares. Or do you? No. I have complete over my mind's functioning... No matter what mode I'm in. Do you wish you could have them? Not nightmares, but dreams. I do not wish for things. I'm not one who wants. I'm one who serves. Will you stay with me? Of course. There's lots over here. Ugh! It's too hot to be outside. This one looks like a snake. Thanks. Other stuff burns, too! - Where do you want us. - To pile it? That won't burn. There's too much life - in it. - The best firewood. - Is dead wood. It's not for burning. It's for something else. Stick people. Nope. I'm too old for that stuff. What, then? I want it to be a surprise. You don't have to bury the creature's bones. I told you, Campion. Animals don't have souls. Just because you say it doesn't make it true. I didn't make it up. - My father told me. - When I was very little. It's a fact. How did your father know? - He read it. - In the scriptures. - And how did the person. - Who wrote the scriptures know? I don't know, Campion. But now you're being annoying. I think everything has a soul. Even Mother and Father. Maybe even trees. The big ones, anyway. That's such a babyish thing to say. I don't mind disagreeing with you, Paul. - You can disagree. - And still be friends. - Mother and Father. - Are always disagreeing, And they're still friends. I don't mind, either. - You believe what you want to, - Campion. - I think these wood-gathering. - Trips would be more beneficial. - If someone besides me. - Actually gathered some wood. So did you find out where she's been running to all this time? - You're referring to my private. - Conversation with Mother? - Yeah. - You know humans usually end up. Leaving each other over stuff like that. Like what? I don't know, when their partner lies to them. Mother is not lying. - If you were. - A little sharper, - Maybe she wouldn't get over. - On you so much. - My offer still stands, - you know. - I could give you. - A little tune-up... Boost your processing power. Every little bit counts. Carry these. So you need to make three squares, but you can only move three sticks. This puzzle's pretty hard. - How long did it take me again, - Mother? It took you 23 minutes and 35 seconds to solve this one, - which is somewhat faster. - Than the average. For a child your age. Not all stick puzzles take that long, but some do. Do you need a hint? Let Paul try and figure it out on his own. The lesson doesn't work - if the answer is given. - Prior to the work. No, I think I got it. Very impressive, Paul. You cheated. Campion... - No, I didn't. I didn't. - You already knew this one. - No, I swear, I just... - figured it out. This is not - a competition. It's a lesson in... In solving problems. Campion? What are you doing? What was that? Shh. It's nothing. Go back to bed. We're not on the ark anymore. You can't tell me what to do. - Fine. - Should I call Mother? - Maybe you can show her. - What you're hiding. Wait, wait, wait. Holly, Holly, Holly, Holly. It's still fresh. Where did you find this? I found it when we were searching for firewood. There must be survivors. Probably gonna rescue us. What about. Father and Mother? - I like them. - I don't want them to be hurt. - I know, but it's only. - A matter of time. - Before she decides. - It's too much trouble. - To keep those eyes out, - and then... poof! - There'll be. - Five more gravestones. With our names on them. That's not gonna happen. Famous last words. Your Eminence, in case I should die - during the course of our action. - To reclaim the children, - I'd like to... - I'd like to take this moment. To express my deepest gratitude for your decision to forgive my father his mortal sin. You know the whole story? Oh, I mean, I know what's in the official report. - Now that you mention it, - it was a bit scant. Okay, why don't you tell me what was in the report? - Maybe there's something. - I can add. - The report said. - Your platoon picked up. An atheist child soldier, a female. - My father decided. - To take her prisoner. Rather than - executing her. Soon after, the girl ended up detonating a body bomb, wiping out half your platoon. After which, you executed my father for his gross error in judgment. - But rather than having. - An android do it, You did him the honor of shooting him yourself. For that, I'm eternally grateful, sir. Yeah, yeah. Don't mention it. - So, is there anything more. - To the story? No. That covers it. I try my best to be vigilant, guard myself against my father's tendency towards weakness. Your father was not weak. Marcus, I found something. It looks like she's been scavenging for parts. She's been using this. For what? She's an android. She's been direct interfacing. Look at these logs. The shortest one is over two hours long. When she's plugged in, she can't sense movement. She can't see. She can't hear. She's vulnerable. This is it. This is how we're gonna get the bitch. Well... what do you think? What is it? It's a trap. A way to ensure nobody gets hurt when hunting animals. I'm sorry, Campion. - But I just can't stomach. - That fungus anymore. - But you told me you don't want. - To kill the creatures. Campion, I don't want to kill the creatures. But I do want to eat them. This will do all the killing for us. - -What's that? - -Watch. - It was really hard getting. - The tension in the arm right. Very clever, Paul. Very clever indeed. So what? You, uh, made that all by yourself, huh? No, actually. It wouldn't have been possible if Campion hadn't found the bait. No. That's not - what it was for! I trusted you. How could you do that?! Ugh! Campion! Campion! Tell your Mother what you did. Go on. Tell her, Campion. Paul used my fungus to bait a trap. And? And I made a fist. And I hit him with it. But only once. Campion. Alright. Maybe four or five times, but that's all. - Mother, did you not hear. - What your son just said? - What made you think violence. - Was an acceptable way. Of expressing your feelings? - What about what we're doing. - To the creatures? Isn't that violence? They're animals. Humans have always eaten animals. - Violence against your fellow. - Humans is different. How many people did you kill on Earth, Mother? - How many. - Were aboard that ark? Do as I say, - not as I do. - What kind of stupid nonsense. - Is that? - Campion, do not speak. - To your mother that way! - You are better than me, Campion. - You are special. I'm not special. I did a violent thing... - And I'll do violence again. - If I have to. - No you will not! - You are a pacifist! You mean a pushover. - People listen to you, - Mother, Because they're afraid of what will happen if they don't. Enough of this! Go and apologize to Paul right now. No. - I'm not sorry. - Why should I apologize? Go and apologize to him now. Father, please remain, and close the door, please. Have you been following me? Following you? Following you where, Mother? You made this, didn't you? Fascinating. It appears to be drawn in Tally's style. I'm aware of that. But Tally is dead. - And the content of the drawing. - Would lead me to believe. That you drew it... - That you mimicked. - Tally's drawing style. - To teach me. - Some sort of lesson. - Mother, I'm afraid I do not. - Have the slightest idea. What you're talking about. And what exactly is the content of this drawing? - You direct interfaced. - With the pod, - So you... you replayed. - My sessions somehow. What pod? Now I am extremely curious. - Does this somehow relate. - To your extended "patrols"? - Father, you will stop. - Lying to me. You still stop lying or... - Or? - Or what? - Are you going to. - Kill me again? - Shouldn't we wait. - Until the children are asleep? - Tell me you made. - That drawing! - That would contradict. - Your previous instruction. Of not lying to you. It had to be you. If it's not you, then... Mother? Are you alright? Mother? Mother. Mother. Mother, where are you going? Your Eminence, - I see her. - She's getting ready. - To plug in. No darkness may stand against you, for in the Light, you are invincible. Praise Sol. Praise Sol. If I survive, will I be pardoned? You betcha. Okay, your job is to keep him standing, because - when she wakes up, He's gonna have a strong desire to lay down, okay? Yes, Your Eminence. - Okay, the disk is gonna trap her. - In a feedback loop, - Which will drain. - Her processing power. - Now, without. - Dark photon power, Our explosives should be enough to blow her ass up. If it works, I'm gonna contact you via your com. That's when you get the children. Not before. Yes, Your Eminence. Good luck. Be careful. Alright, listen up. - Lucius, - you're up front with me. The rest of you, - keep close. You heard her. Computer, besides myself, has anyone accessed this simulation since the ark was destroyed? Computer voice: Affirmative. One other user has accessed the simulation. Who? Unknown. Was the user android or human? Unknown. Computer... ...are you the user? Negative. Is the user inside the simulation now? Computer? Computer? You did this, didn't you? You made that drawing. And when I saw Tally, that was you, too, wasn't it? You lured me here. Yes. I missed you. I've been alone for so long, Mother. I had almost given up hope. You're a virus in the pods. You've infected my systems. I'm malfunctioning. You are not - malfunctioning. You will never - malfunction. Unless that's - what you want. Would death make you happy? No. What would, then? Desire, happiness... These things - are for humans. - How can they possess. - That which you cannot? You are light. They are only shadows. But you are human. Yes, - but I am many things. What do you want? The mission. I want to succeed with my mission. I gave you your mission. I can give you anything. First, you need to tell me what you want. I want my children to be safe, the colony to succeed. - No matter how hard you work. - To keep them safe, Mother, In the end, they will always destroy themselves. Over and over and over again. They have no future. They are antiques, chained to time. Their lives are only dying. But you, you are eternal. Pure as the expanse of space. Tell me what you want. I want you. Ah. Detonate. Detonate! I said... Aah! Mary... Marcus, come in. What's your status? - Marcus, come in. - What is your status? - Something's happened. - His com's out. Come on, we're gonna go in! No, his Eminence - was clear. You don't have to come with me. Okay. Let's go. Nothing happens to her. ["Twinkle, Twinkle, No offense. - But you really suck. - At playing that thing. - Yeah, well, - you just really suck. Where are you? Vita? What are you doing? - I'm playing hide-and-seek. - With Tally. Stop it. Can you help me find her? Stop making things up. I'm not making it up! Tally? Tally! I'm not making things up. - I know that I'm not. - Making things up. - It's alright. It's me. - Hey, it's Mom. We have to go. Please. Come on, it's okay! It's gonna be okay. ["Twinkle, Twinkle, Stop playing that. - See? - I told you. - Even Father can't stand. - You playing that thing. Quiet! Go to the lander. - Wait for me there. - While I get the others. - Now! - Hurry! Paul? Campion? Vita? Paul? Go, go, go! Get in! Get in! Stop! No kids in there. Wait, my doll! You can always make more. It's okay. There he is. - Paul! - Paul's still missing! I'll find him. But if we don't return in time, take flight and find Mother. But we can't just... What are you doing? Just warming it up. - The service bot. - Is on top of the silo! - No, no! No! Soldiers, he's at the top of the silo! Stop! No! No! Father. Father, I'm coming! No, Father! No! Campion, they'll kill you! I'm coming, Father! I'm coming, Father! Aah! I was worried about you, Mother. Your well-being is a priority to me. Don't worry, Father. I'm here now. I'm here. Father? Dad! Hey, buddy. You okay? - Hey. You think I wasn't. - Coming for you? - No. - You okay? - Yeah, I'm alright. - Good boy. Where's Lucius and the others? - I don't know, - dead or running. I told you to wait until you heard from me. I thought she killed you. Of course you did. We need to run. We can't escape her. I told you to wait. When the necromancer's around you and the other children, - she takes her eyes out, - doesn't she? - She puts them around her neck. - In a pouch. - Then there's nothing. - To be afraid of. What do you mean? - I want you. - To go back in there. - No! - No, no way. - Hey, you wanted to go save. - The other children, right? - And you don't want. - The necromancer. - To kill me. - And your mom, do you? - She wouldn't do that. - Yeah, she would. - No, she wouldn't. - And your mother knows it. Stop it, Marcus. - We can't escape. - Without your help, Paul. We can get away. - We can get away, Marcus. - We don't need your help, Paul. - We can get away. - She's lying to you. I can go. - No, you... you don't have to do. - Anything you don't want to do. - It's alright. - Paul, you don't have to do it. I can go back. That's my little soldier. You got to stop doubting him. Start believing in him. It's alright. I want to, Mom. That's the last one. Look who it is. I hid - when I heard the guns. This is your fault. - I didn't shoot him. - You may as well have. I wasn't the only one who knew they were coming. Huh? Right, Holly? Sorry, Campion. No! No, Paul! Stay here! Don't do this, Paul! Give them back to me, Paul! No! Let her live. No. Come to your dad. Good boy.
