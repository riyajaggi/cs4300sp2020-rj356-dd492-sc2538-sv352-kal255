 for my weakness. Grant me the power of your light so that I may bear your whip and purify this wicked planet. Simply purge these shadows from my sight, and I promise you I will deliver your judgment. I am your one true Sol. I am ready to receive your power. Just say the word, and I will be...

 Hey. Do you know who I am? Have we met? No. We never met. But you know me. - You raise a weapon against me, - child? I was sleeping, you sick bastard! I remember now. And I also remember how small you are. Careful, dear. You can't hurt me again. That helmet prevents it. So tell me... You tell me how does it feel knowing that I can do whatever I want to you, and you can't stop me? No, Tempest! Mother? Mother. There's no need - to hurt me. Where's your guard? It's in the backpack. What are you doing? - What functions do you. - Still have available? Proximity trigger active. Behavioral guard in the helmet is... checking status... active. - What's the maximum distance. - He's allowed from you. Before the helmet - kills him? 10 feet. I want to kill him. I understand that, Tempest. Do you? - Every time. - I feel this baby move, I'm forced to think of this piece of shit raping me. Does this port allow for blood draw? - Yes, of course. - Mother, - Are you listening to me? - What's the color. - For outflow? Red. Mother! Mother, - I'm talking to you! What are you doing? I'm feeding my fetus. Your fetus? Tell me where they went. All alone now. Tell me where they went. I did all you wanted me to. Now come on. Help me get my son back. - Poor idiots. - Are gonna die out there. - Can't believe they took off. - Without telling me, After everything I've done for them. Can't listen to that thing anymore. Start loading the lander with food and supplies. - Reinstall. - The lift drive module. My holo-screen appears to have self-activated. Huh. Probably some malfunction caused by the amputation. Hold on. Revert to old program. Password. Password... Shit. It's Morse code. Sol is the light. Sol is... the light. Hey, Father. Say something. Father? An android, a black hole, and a glass of milk walk into a bar. Father! Alright. Let's go. - I'll finish this joke. - At a later date. You need to convince them to take you along on the search. Thank you. Let's go, Pop. Wait, can I come with you? - I know the kids well, - like family. I could help wrangle them. They trust me. Hmm. - You didn't do such a good job. - Of wrangling them last night, - though, did you? You coming or not? - How will we track them without. - The locators, Your Eminence? We're going back to the temple. Sol will speak to me there. - Sol brought him. - Back to me. You said he fell down a pit. He did. But I prayed for Sol to give him back to me, and it worked. - So now. - You don't have to wonder. Whether or not. Sol is real anymore. So now you have proof. - My sister Tally fell down a pit. - When we were small. - When I was locked up. - In the silo, She came back and talked to me. Only she was different. What's the word? Evil? - Hey, come on. - We got to get moving. We're too out in the open here. Pack everything you can. - Girls, please, wake up. - Get up. Sol, tell me where they are, please. I will do anything. Does my son not trust me? Does he not love me? Please tell me. Why are we here? 'Cause you never know what we might find. You know, food, supplies, water. The stuff for survival. - I can't believe. - Something so big. Could actually fly. It must have been magnificent. - This is one of the relics. - We brought from Earth. A tooth? It was taken from the body of Romulus. He and his brother were raised by a she-wolf who lost her cubs. We have to keep it safe. I found it for a reason. A reason. Sol led us here so that we could find this holy relic, so that we can save our culture. - Keep your teeth. - I don't care. - Now, if you can please. - Look for things. We can actually use, that would be great. Blood! It's fresh. Tempest. It could be from anyone. Hold up. - You got pregnant. - In a sim pod? Yes. - I didn't even know androids. - Could get pregnant. Nor did I. How did it happen? It's beyond my understanding. My creator made it possible. You sound religious suddenly. Nonsense. So, now that you're all pregnant, - your programming tells you. - To turn away. - The girl that you said. - You'd never leave? You're referring to the other day. - I had to send you away, - Tempest. - Otherwise I could have. - Put you in danger. You're not a danger to me. I feel the urge to protect you. I also feel the need to feed my fetus. You were afraid you would... - My programming has. - Become unpredictable. It was just - a precaution. Okay, but where are we even going? To a place where the delivery is most likely to be successful. Child, you must see this necromancer's malfunctioning. She has no need for human blood, - and she's certainly. - Not pregnant. She is insane. And she'll turn on you. She is the threat, not me. One more word out of you, - and I will skewer. - Your metal head. What is it? Metal. These were placed here recently. By who? This one reminds me of you and Father. And that one's. Sol Invictus. - These remind me of the old. - Tarot cards back on Earth. Used by the devil cults before we purged their ranks. Quiet. Something's approaching. Hide. Otho, hide yourself! You think you can walk now? Yep. Alright. - -Maybe in a little bit. - -There's more blood. What? Campion! - -Mother? - -Campion! Mother! Tempest! - I thought I'd never. - See you again! I knew you were alive! Step away from the android, Campion. I said step away! - She's not. - Going to hurt anyone. She is a weapon of mass destruction. She kidnapped - these kids. - No! - She's a good Mother! - -Vita, move! - -Don't shoot! - Paul, please. - This is not a request! - I can't. - I'm sorry. Paul, - move away from her. - I understand your fear, - soldier. Don't be afraid. Step out, Otho. This android is malfunctioning. - No, no, no, no. - No way, no way. - Kids... - Kids, get behind me now. It's alright. He's under my control. - His life is forfeit. - Because of his crime. I will shoot you! I will shoot you and the rapist in front of them! Paul. Paul, get behind me. No. What did you do to him? Are you feeding on him? No, my fetus is. That's not possible. It is real. What's wrong with your stomach, Mother? Would you like to say hello to Number Seven, Campion? It's just - a temporary name. We'll have to come up with a permanent one soon. Perhaps you'd like to choose one. - You had another. - Frozen embryo? - No. - This is my own fetus. Did Father help you make it, like the way humans do it? No, Father didn't help me. I made it myself. How did you do that? That is beyond my understanding. Would you like to say hello to it? Hi, baby. Hello? What is it? What's the matter? Nothing. Nothing. It's just been under too much stress. - -Please! - -Maybe you can help! - Hey, I'm a doctor, - not a mechanic. - Please! - Help her! Please. Help her, please! Okay, go... Go get my bag. Come on. Come on, Mother. Lift. Give me more slack, please. Can you hear what he's saying? - I think he wants to know. - Where Sue took their kid. - He should make. - An example of her. Throw her in one of the pits. Settle down. We have to find her first. You're friends with my son, right? Yeah, I-I guess. And the girls? Uh, sure, sure. Then they must have told you what they were planning. No. No, no, no, no, no. They... They didn't. - They didn't. - They didn't tell me anything. - Why do you. - Keep looking at him? Because he can tell you. - He's been with me. - Most of the time. Tell them. That is accurate. I've not witnessed him speaking with the escapees. I swear. I swear to Sol. Your Eminence? - Your Eminence, I swear to Sol, - I di... - I didn't... - I didn't do anything. - I swear. - I'm telling the truth. - I don't know where he is. - I don't know where he is. I don't know where he is! No! I don't know! Sol has shielded him. - He must be telling the truth, - Your Eminence. - Is she going. - To be okay? Yeah. Yeah, she will. She just needs some rest. And so do you. Go on. Did you tell them the truth? Well, whatever this is, resting seems to have helped. Yeah, I detect activity. There's growth. - And you're displaying. - The signs a human would, but... That's not what I meant. Did you tell them the truth... Paul... About who you are? What are you talking about? You're not his mother. You had a facial reconstruction, like your husband. You two have been deceiving the Mithraic. If you tell Paul, it will destroy him. Interesting. Why do you care about Paul? He's not your own. You do not have the care-giving program I have. It's called human empathy. - Yeah, it's something that. - You will never understand. Because you are just an elaborate piece of... tech. That is correct. - Though I wonder, - as an atheist, - If we have more. - In common than not. Don't flatter yourself. Paul. I will respect your wishes. I understand that sometimes we must lie - to spare. - The feelings of humans. You seem to be a successful mother, if not a natural one. Move! On your feet! Sol, guide us, keep us safe. - Guide us out. - Of the darkness. Secure safety belts. You were on guard, Dorian. I don't understand. - The android was programmed. - To serve us. Hunter must have cracked the security code, reverted him. You were on guard, Dorian. I... Damn! Scan. It seems our blood flow has been reversed. Your power is now mine. A locator signal. Belongs to a prisoner. The vital signs are highly irregular. 'Cause he's probably dead, right? No. These energy levels are inordinately high. On par with Mother's. I'm plotting a course. No! No! Mother! No! Mom! Kid? No, no, no, no, no! Let go of me! Let go of me! Let go! - -No, let go of him! - -No! Sol, make me brave. Please, no. Let go! Let go of me! Let go! Hey! Holly. Holly, get away. You don't want her. She's not a believer. Her soul's impure. It was you. You convinced her that Sol didn't exist. What you did to her. Run! Tempest! Run! Tempest! No! No! No! No! Tempest. Tempest? It's over. It's over. It's over. If we go back now, we could make it in a few days. We're doomed. - All so he can chase. - His damn wife. Sol does not - want us here. We have strayed from His light. He's leading us into hell. For you, my Lord, I sacrifice. Now speak to me. I am listening. My Lord? Mother? Mother? Mother? Mother? Father? Yes. Is this a memory? No, Mother. This is now. You've been restored. Campion. Campion. You're not real. It's alright. It's really me. Which you do you mean? Knock, knock. Don't ever leave me again. That's twice now. Never again. Promise me. Promise. Is it alright? It's not responding to my touch. What isn't? Her baby, Father. It's dead. He drained it. I can feel it. - Mother, it's likely. - Internal bleeding. Collecting - in your stomach. Now, if you'd allow me to relieve the pressure... It's real, Father. The fetus is half carbon-based. It needs plasma. Then I will find a creature. I'll go with you. - Hey, - can you give us a minute? Go on. What are you doing? I'm saving your baby. - Just a pint, and then. - I got to cut you off. Why are you doing this for me? I'm not your family or your friend. You asked why I cared about Paul when he wasn't my own. Yes. You said humans have empathy, which androids lack. Right. I can't have kids. I had a bad miscarriage. It was years ago. So, - when we found Paul... I know that. Sol is a lie. But I suddenly understood how - when people can't believe. - Their luck, They have to make up a god to thank for it. There. That's enough. Are you feeling it? Yes. Thank you. Praise Sol. Want to hear a secret? Sure. Sol put that baby inside Mother. How do you know? I can just feel it. He's not evil, like you said. He's trying to help us. And this baby is gonna change everything. You know I killed him. Yes, Tempest. It moved. It's alive. Thank you. - Has Sol spoken to you. - Yet, Your Eminence? Has He told you where we're headed? It seems He doesn't quite favor you as He once did. He tests us. Dorian was more than a test. We will pray for his soul. - But you obviously. - Deemed him impure. Yes. All the more reason to pray for him. You're upset. Perhaps you should stay quiet until you recovered your senses. Did you pray for my father after you executed him? Did you pray for his soul? Of course. Do you see any resemblance between us, my father and I? Just a simple question, - one you should have. - No trouble answering. A true Mithraic would never pray for a soul he deemed impure. What the necromancer said is true, isn't it? You're not Marcus Drusus. So who the hell - are you? You all wanted to be deceived. - You're nothing. - But a bunch of sheep... All of you... Unworthy of Sol's love. - You see, all I did was lead you. - Back to the light. It doesn't matter who I am. All that matters is that. He chose me to be king. Then He will surely protect you, then. Let Sol's will be done.
