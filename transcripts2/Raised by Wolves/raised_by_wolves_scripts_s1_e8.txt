 See, your mother wants to coddle you. - And to tell you the truth, - I do, too. I want to spoil you rotten, but I can't. Sol's not gonna take it easy on you, so neither can I. I got to teach you to be a survivor. Campion. Shut up. Shut up, I say! Campion. Knock, knock. Who's there? Dozen. Dozen who? Dozen all this knocking bother you? Knock, knock. Who's there? Egg. Egg who? Egg-stremely disappointed you don't recognize me. Well, - at least he can cook. I can have a look at him if you want. - You're handy. - With the service models? Yeah. A little bit. That's enough. That's good. I have no feeling in those mechanisms. I cannot control their operation. Diagnostics - all look good. - There's a weird glitch. - In your tech. Wait. Is that code - or something? It is. It's Morse code. You are old. So primitive. S... O... I... I... S... T... H... E... I... I... "Light." "Sol is the light." "Sol is the light." For a minute there, I thought you were still in there, Pops. Has the ark - landed yet? In a manner of speaking... Yes. My blood levels are dropping. What are you doing? - I'm a doctor, - not a bloodbag. Today, - you are both. You're an A-plus life technician, correct? Yes. - Able to repair both humans. - And androids? As well as plants, animals, and terrestrial insects. - As you can see, - I've sustained some damage. Over the past few hours, I've begun experiencing a great deal of discomfort in my abdomen. What do you advise? Hmm... - your wounds. - Are bleeding internally, Draining into - your stomach. - You need to release. - The pressure. You okay? How much longer does he have to stay in the silo? He'll be coming out soon. I promise. - Alright. - Come on. Come on. Is Dad gonna be okay? I've never seen him like that before. He'll be fine. - 'Cause he's. - A tough survivor, right? Yeah, - something like that. Do I have to be a tough survivor? You already are. Do you like it here? It's okay, I guess. - Because... - there's more of the planet. That we haven't even seen yet. Maybe we could - check it out. Like an adventure? Yeah, like an adventure. Yeah, - I'd like that. Could we bring Campion? Don't see why not. - So, we don't. - Have to treat him. Like the way we treated atheists on Earth? No, we don't. - Is Dad gonna come. - On the adventure? Do you want him to? Yeah. But I'm sure he's got a lot of important stuff to do here. Could we go without him? Mm-hmm. Yeah, we could. Let's not tell Dad, okay? He's got a lot on his mind. - Just keep it. - Between me and you. Okay. Okay. - Is the discomfort. - In your abdomen subsiding? No. There may be coagulation. Reach your fingers in - and see if. - You can break up the blockage. I'm Karl. - I've lost pairing. - With my brothers. Do you know where they are? Broken. Ah. - Without them, - it will be difficult. - To care for. - A thousand colonists. - I don't think. - They'll be requiring. Much medical attention. - I'm feeling something. - That is not. - In my anatomical. - Build description. What is it? I don't know, - Karl. You're the doctor. Can you - get a look at it? Spherical. 3.4 inches in diameter. - Oh, - probably a silicon tumor. Pull it out with a counter-clockwise motion. What is it? It moved. That's unusual. It's reacting - to my touch. - Your senses. - May be misfiring. My caregiving program... It's overriding me. That's odd. Your survival is essential to your caregiving duties. Are you sure? Yes. Perhaps the tumor has corrupted your programming parameters. Must be some new strain of silicon tumor particular to this environment. - Have you been exposed. - To any foreign entities. - During your time. - On this planet? No. If I can't alleviate this discomfort, I have no hope of being able to rescue my children. The only way to alleviate discomfort - is to. - Feed the tumor fuel-blood. - Then it will cease. - To feed on you. This will temporarily help you regain your strength, but it will also accelerate the tumor's growth. Hmm, and your inevitable breakdown. I have no choice. So, more fuel blood? Yes. But don't look at me. - You'll need to find. - More donors. - Campion. - Got some fungus for you. Pull it up. Thanks. Paul. We wear the armor of Mithras and the light. We are shielded from all that is harmful. Sol, - give us the strength. To make the tough decisions we must face. Guide us with your wisdom. Bless us with your light. Praise Sol. Praise Sol. - Sol never said. - That it would be easy. Colonizing this world, did he? No. So, we must focus on serving him, right? Yes, we should. So, that means we must stay pure. That means you must stay away from that atheist kid, okay? Okay. Good boy. How's the pain? I saw you in the church. That couldn't have been easy for you, watching me pray. - Yeah, well, - there's a first for everything. Belief doesn't happen overnight. It's not how it works. So, - you're an expert now? Mm-hmm. I was thinking about our first date. - That wasn't a date. - I was being tortured. You needed rescuing. No, I didn't. - I-I was in the process. - Of escaping. And I rescued you. All the other prisoners... cracked, but not you. Not my Mary. I guess I'm stubborn like that. I'm starting to forget your face. Close your eyes. Praise be to Sol. Sol is the light. If you are not a designated passenger on the ark of heaven, please clear the area. - All chosen passengers. - Must proceed. To security checkpoint 5. A new Eden awaits you on Kepler-22b. If you do not have a passport, you will not be granted entry. Repeat, if you do not have a passport, you will not be granted entry. Rocking entryways or otherwise competing passenger boarding is strictly prohibited. Violators will be executed on sight. Praise be to Sol. Sol is light. If you are not a designated passenger on the ark of heaven, please clear the area. All chosen passengers must proceed to security checkpoint 5. If you do not have a passport, you will not be granted entry. - I don't know. - About this, Caleb. - It's Marcus from now on, - remember? Marcus, and you're Sue. - That's what. - I'm talking about. I don't know - if I can do it. Yes, you can. How? How do you know? - Because I can't do it. - Without you. We're traitors. We're not traitors - as long as we have. - Each other's back. - You and me... - That's all that matters. You and me. You and me. You gonna keep cheating? What do you got? - Like, five, six cards. - In your sleeve? Popping it off, yeah? You're horrible. Don't get too sensitive there. Well, he's fucking cheating. I'm not cheating. 100% you're cheating. - Put a little surprise. - In there for you. What you doing, buddy? Nothing. I told you to stay away. I know, but I... I just... Did Mommy put you up to this? No. No? You and Mommy up to something? - Huh? - No. - Huh? You're not. - Planning something? - No? - Mnh-mnh. You're not hiding anything from me, are you? No. - 'Cause it kinda looks like. - You're hiding something. From your daddy. I'm not. - You're not lying. - To me, are you? Because you know I hate liars. Look at me. You're not lying to me, are you? No. I love you. I would never leave you. Are you and Mommy planning something? Are you and Mommy planning something? - You can tell me. - It's okay. No. - You would never lie to me, - would you? - Never. - Mom! - Why are you. - Calling your mom? I'm just asking a normal question, huh? It's okay. Shh. - Are you and your mommy. - Planning something? - You can tell me. - Quickly. - You can tell me. - It's okay. Mom! It's okay. Get the hell away from him! Come on, Paul, we're leaving. It's okay. Get back here. Don't touch me. You are not leaving me. - Watch me. - You're not taking him. Come on. - -Mom! - -Let go of me! - -Mom! - -Get your hands off me! - -Mommy! - -Paul, no. - -It's okay. - -Mom! - -Please grab my son. - -No! - -No! - -Mom! - Paul, no! - Let go of him! Dad, stop it! Mom! Let go of him! Dad, stop it! Paul, no! Don't you touch him! No, no! No, don't, don't! No! Dad, stop it! No, no. I told you, we're not going anywhere! Forgive my wife! She has lost her way! Please pray for her! Forgive my wife, Sol! We must pray that she returns to Sol's light. Pray for her! Tempest was right to run away from here. Why did the android cross the road? - To return to. - His factory settings. - Knock, knock. - Who's there? - Wooden shoe. - Wooden shoe who? Wooden shoe like to hear another? Campion, it's me. Paul? Campion, can you hear me? I can barely hear you. Well, then, stick it in your ear. Campion? Yes! I can hear you! Are you all right? I heard your father... I'm fine. I'm gonna help you break out of there. - I have an idea for something. - You can make, - But you're not. - Gonna like it. - You're gonna. - Dig your way out. What do you think I've been trying to do all this time? - I hope there's more. - To your plan than just... - Just let me finish. - Please. - You're gonna dig. - Your way out, - But with. - Someone else's hands. - I had hoped to see. - My brothers again, But this wasn't at all what I had in mind. I'm sorry, Karl. Well, I suppose they would be pleased that, even in death, they're helping to alleviate pain. I allowed myself to be invaded, neglected my mission, my family. Campion is now suffering because of my actions. This is causing me great distress. You needn't display emotion for my benefit. I know that, Karl. Then why - are you doing it? My partner and I sometimes suffer from... impulses not dictated by programming. - Have you ever come across. - Such a condition? No. You are unique. I'd rather not be. I'd prefer it if I could revert to my factory settings. - Humans often complain. - Of suffering, But they also herald it. Yes. Despite being raised pacifist, my son Campion and his siblings often played war. What they derived from such games is beyond my understanding. Campion. Campion. Yes? I'm here. Are you almost out? - -Yes. - -Okay, I'll see you soon. What are you doing, buddy? Uh... I thought something in Mom's bag - might help make. - The pain go away. There's nothing in that bag that you need. You gonna let Mom out? I'm sorry about what happened. Do you forgive me? - It's fine. - It was my fault. No. It wasn't your fault, and I don't want you to worry. You see, your mom and I love each other very much, but sometimes, we just don't see eye to eye. - And the truth is I was. - Really scared. That your mommy and you were gonna leave me. But now I know you would never do that. I wear the armor of. Mithras and the light. Please, Sol, show me that I am on a righteous path. I need you to show me. Show me that I am not crazy. That I am the chosen one. Tell me what I should do. The church is on fire! We need water! Be careful. Is there anyone in there? - Bartok, Cassia, Dorian, - follow the child! Go! Go! Get moving! Come on! Where are you going? - I'm taking my mom and Campion. - To the lander. - Please don't tell anyone. - I won't. But as long as you take us with you. Fine! Come on, come on! Mom. No. Paul. Come on, Mom. Come on. What the hell? - They're coming with us. - Come on. - They are? - Yeah. Oh, God. It's still hurting. It's killing me, isn't it? Most likely. But you never know. You're a necromancer. Your kind was always full of surprises. Hmm. You're trying to cheer me up. Yes. - It is accurate to say. - That dark photons. Are a poorly understood technology. - But the Mithraic designed. - And built me. - How could they not possess. - A full understanding. Of their own technology? - They followed the formulas. - They discovered. Were encrypted in their scriptures with no real - understanding. Of the underlying concepts. The... The... The... The... The... The... The... The technology that powers you was a gift from Sol, passed down from the heavens at the dawn of man. That is. Mithraic propaganda. Perhaps. I only know what I've been programmed to believe. But of course, same goes for you. I need more donors. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Father? Is it you? It started itching as soon as I tasted the plasma. You think the growth has carbon based components? How is that... possible? I know. It makes no logical sense. But I thought I could feel it hungering. Perhaps when the plasma circulates from my system... What am I doing? - I'm acting more irrationally. - Than a human. Karl? Campion, can you hear me? Meet us at the lander. Oh, come on. No. No, no, no, no, no, no. Come on. - No, no. - -What's the matter? - -Hurry up! - They're gonna see us! - Fly! Fly! - Shut up! Shut up, please! - Shut up! Lander, troubleshoot. No, you bastard. Okay, everyone out. Move! Let's go! Let's go! Everyone out! Let's go! Tempest. Mother! - What are you doing here. - Alone? I was looking for you. And Campion? He's still imprisoned. A-At least he was when I left. Is he alright? Yeah. Tempest. Mm. You're bleeding. Before you lecture me. About being careful, it's just - a few scratches. It's nothing serious. Mother? Stay away from me, Tempest. Are you okay? I said, you need to stay away from me. What? I just found you. Get away! Do you know where you're going? Yeah. Doesn't look like it. Hold it! Time to do some penance. Campion! This way. And move. Go. Warning... sim is not intended for android interface. Begin simulation. Warning... sim is not intended for android interface. Campion Sturges: You see? I told you I could give you anything. What did you do to me? What is it? A child, Mother. A child that will always be a part of you. A child who will never reject you. No. - Never tell you. - That you're not real. No. I don't want it. You've given all of yourself since you were built. This is your reward. I need to get back to Campion. What about the mission? - What you're carrying inside you. - Is the mission. No. - It's always. - Been the mission. No. No. No, that's not possible. Campion and all the others were just a rehearsal. It was all to prepare you for this. No. The future of humanity is growing inside you. No, I don't want it. I don't want it. I don't want it! Warning... sim is not intended for android interface. No. No! Warning... sim is not intended for an...
