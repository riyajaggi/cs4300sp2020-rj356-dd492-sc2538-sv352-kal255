 It's okay. - It's okay. - I'll kill you! - Stand down. - Listen to me. We're not here - to hurt you, - And I know you don't want. - To hurt anyone, So just hand over the gun. Campion, remember... violence won't help. Put it down. Give him the gun. Don't want to leave you, Mother. You'll be fine. No! Don't put me in here! I want to be with Mother! Can't do that. - Not after that little stunt. - You just pulled. It's just for a little while, until I can figure it out, how I can help you. - You're a liar. - You don't want to help me. Is that - what Earth was? Just a bunch - of lies? Do any of you tell the truth about anything? Not really, kid. Let me out. I want - to be with Mother! Let me out! Reinforce this door. - She's smaller than. - I thought she'd be. [Static, woman speaking. ♪ The door that finally opens ♪ ♪ With light flooding in ♪ ♪ Spilling out on the floor ♪ ♪ The core that never was ♪ ♪ Now it will be ♪ ♪ The bones of what was there before ♪ ♪ Every step, every beat ♪ ♪ Every thought, every breath, everything ♪ ♪ Is longing ♪ ♪ Pulling you from the sky ♪ ♪ Just like love will do ♪ ♪ Pulling you from the ground ♪ ♪ Just like love will do ♪ I told you you could do it. Whoo! There's my little soldier. I'm so proud of you. Are you proud of me, Mom? Yeah. Of course I am. I'm hungry. I made a trap. - Makes killing the creatures. - Really easy. And what about the crops? They're radioactive. There's some food in the barracks. I'll get some - for all of us. Come right back. Huh. There's a little life left in you, huh? You used Paul. - You're no better than. - The assholes. That sent you to the front when you were 12 years old. I knew - he was gonna be okay. No, you didn't. Well, - neither did you. - What should we do? - Call child services? - Have him put in. - A more stable home? Is that - what you want? No, what I want is to stop listening to that shit. We got Paul back. We don't need them anymore. - You know, back on Earth, - you promised me. That we would - take revenge. - Do you remember? - Go ahead. - Kill 'em all. - I don't need. - To kill them. I just need to ditch them as soon as possible. There's one lander here. - I say we take it, we fill it. - With as many supplies as we can, - And we head to the tropical. - Zone, just the three of us. We just got here. Give me some time to think. What's the rush? Yeah, I know you're having fun being worshipped, but that was a means to an end. These people destroyed the Earth. If we keep this up, we're not survivors, we're traitors. Okay, fine. We can go. As soon as I reprogram the two androids, okay? The service model will be more than enough to help. We don't need the necromancer. - What if. - You can't control her? Be safer if you destroy her. What is it? Nothing. I'm not - destroying her. You spent - your whole life. - Watching those things. - Slaughter your friends. - I would have thought. - You'd want to destroy her. I know I do. She's the most powerful weapon on this planet. What if there's more ships coming from Earth? Because without her, whatever we build in the tropical zone... It can be taken away from us. Fine. Fine. I'll be with Paul. Hello, Lamia. What have you done with Campion? He's in a time-out at the moment. And the other children? - They're safe. - Mm. Now. You have your son back. Let me take my family - and we'll leave here. - Peacefully. Your family? Oh. You mean the children that you stole? They belong with me. Hmm. Okay, so, I should just, um... take your word - for it? Just... let you leave? I have no reason to deceive you. Yeah. Pretty sure that you do. These people who follow you... Do they know who you truly are? You changed your face. Did you change your name with it? I detected your surgical scars when we first met. Your original face was tattooed when you were just a child. You served with the atheist brigade. Is that why you didn't kill me? We are of a like mind, you and I. I don't think so. Hmm? See... I've seen a lot of your kind kill a lot of mine. We're not here to repeat history. And yet, - here we are. We have an opportunity, you and I, to shape the future of humanity, to build a civilization founded on humanity's belief in itself. Think about it. No war. No suffering. Whoever reprogrammed you did a hell of a job. For a second there, I actually thought that you cared. Hmm. - Preserving humanity. - Has always been my mission. Well, it hasn't been very successful, then, has it? Considering you killed all those people on the ark, including all of those children - that you did not. - Take with you. Then why haven't you destroyed me? What were you doing in the sim? Why did you keep going back there? Hmm? Must have been pretty special for you to let your guard down like that. What's wrong? Hmm? Reality not good enough for you? Hmm. No one goes in there but me. Yes, - Your Eminence. I walk the path of the sun and gaze upon his glory. Let the light break forth to thee, our only conservation now, our future of great reward. Oh, Sol thyself, please be our guide, and draw our souls to thee. Shade of night and morning ray, took from thee the name of day. Listen to our mournful cry. Now again, the shades are nigh. Father. They fixed you. Remove yourself from my hand, child. - You will hinder. - My performance. He's not Father anymore. Then... who is he? He's just an android now, Vita. Hunter told me your pendants been taken from you. These belonged to the soldiers that died in the attack. They would have wanted you to have them. Nice. Praise Sol. - Praise Sol. - Praise Sol. Praise Sol. What's gonna happen to Campion? He needs - to be baptized. He's impure and not fit to speak to. Do you understand? What are you doing? You're gonna - curse yourself. We're already cursed. Don't, Vita. - We need. - To sneak Campion some food. You heard the soldier. - We shouldn't go near him. - Until he's been baptized. You knew - they were coming. - You could have warned. - Mother and Father. - I expect it from Hunter, - but you... - The androids. - Killed our people. They kidnapped us, - Tempest. - No. - They rescued us. - I know why you hate. - Our religion, - But that was just. - One Cleric. It wasn't Sol. Well, thanks for clearing that up, Holly. I guess it makes everything that happened to me okay. Don't listen to her. Sol is real. He told us he saw the city of Mithras in his dreams. So, we asked him to show us. And show us he did. This is where we're gonna live, Dad... In the tower of Mithras... As Sol intended. We'll be able to see for miles. Could it be that the scriptures were mistranslated? Perhaps the boy foretold to unlock the mysteries is not an orphan after all. Campion. Campion. Tempest? Are you okay? Yes. - What did they do. - With Mother and Father? They locked Mother in the other silo. And Father? He's not Father anymore. What? They reprogrammed him, Campion. - Here. - I brought you some fungus. They'll let you out if you just tell them that you accept Sol. But I don't. Neither do I, but they don't need to know that. Hey! Get back inside! - Look, just tell them. - What they want to hear. Campion. Hello? We miss you. We miss you. Campion. Don't you miss us? Kill your father, Campion. Then we can all be together. We're waiting for you. Hey, trigger finger, bring that load of wood over here. We're going to need more than that. Get some more. Hey, what are you doing? Is manual labor still a foreign concept to you? - You need to be careful. - You might hurt the baby. Keep your - loud mouth shut. Why keep it - a secret? - You could get. - Special treatment. I don't want special treatment, dumb-ass. I just want to be left alone. Yeah. You won't be able to hide it forever. Should be around here somewhere. I set it earlier. - Wow. - Whoa. - It really works. - No, no, no. - Wait. - Wait, let me see. Mom, it's dead. You made that? So we didn't have to kill them ourselves. Campion found the bait. We're friends. Well... we were friends. I have to help him see the light. If he's baptized, we'll let him out, right? One of these days, I'm gonna eat something that tastes good. What are you talking about? - We ate lots of good stuff. - On Earth. - Yeah, I guess it's been so long, - I just forgot. Can I get that cloth? Yeah. There's so much meat here. Hey, Paul, listen to me. - You can't tell anybody. - About this, right? Okay. Keep it a surprise. Disgusting. Any attempt to reprogram me will result in failure. - Somebody's done it before. - Mm. Someone who was firm in his atheistic beliefs. There's nothing wrong with doing whatever it takes to survive. Is that what your parents taught you? Some things you learn as you go. You were orphaned. Is that why you became a child soldier? What happened to your parents? Did they abandon you, or did they die in the war? It doesn't matter. They're gone. And yet, you carry that pain. Hmm? Is that part of your program? Being a shrink? The past informs every decision a human makes, and every choice - you've made. Has served your own self-interest. Actually, my wife and I came here to save my son. You have your son. And now what? Do you think you have what it takes to be a good parent? It can't be that hard. You figured it out. No. My creator did. I am what he programmed me to be... A caregiver, a mother. What do you have to give a child? You lost, okay? - Whatever you say. - Is not gonna change that. You've only known destruction, loss. Never nurtured anything in your life. How would you know how to nurture? You use people, as you've used those believers. You are not equipped to raise a child when you're nothing more than a lost boy yourself. Paul is better off without you... and you know it. Lost boy. What does she know? She's not even human. I'll end that bitch. Let her live. Let her live, and you will be king of this world. Shut up! Shut up! King. Dad. - We're having a ceremony. - For Campion's baptism. - You should be there. - Stay away from me. - But it's important. - Dad. I said - stay away from me. Don't try anything stupid. Come on, Campion. They're gonna - let you out, - But you have to let them. - Baptize you. I don't want - to be baptized. I don't want anything to do with your religion anymore. I want my parents back. I know, but suffering in here isn't gonna make that happen. This is the only way. You have to accept Sol. Can I see Mother first? I'm sorry. My father won't allow it. She's too dangerous. - Come on. - You promised you would behave. You'll be fine. Let's go. It's not finished yet. But as long as it's got a roof, it still counts, - right? Counts as what? A church. Kneel down, child. Are you ready to accept Sol into your heart? Or would you prefer to return to the silo? No, I'm ready. Sol, cleanse this child's spirit with your radiance and unconquerable light. Praise Sol. Praise Sol. Repeat after me. "I wear the Armor of Mithras..." I wear the Armor of Mithras... "...and the light..." ...and the light... "...it shields me from all that is harmful." ...it shields me from... Finish the recitation. "It shields me from all that is harmful." Finish the recitation. Campion? Finish the recitation. Campion. You used their headstones? Is that what they were? The android - found them. It doesn't matter. No need to mark the graves of atheists. They're soulless, undeserving of Sol's grace. It's alright, Campion. They're just stones. They don't mean anything. This is your last chance to save yourself. Do you accept? Do you accept, Campion? Put him back in the silo. Now. I had hoped that you were faking, Father. That you might still be in there. - There. - Do you like that? Do you like how that feels? What is wrong with you? Paul told me - what happened. - Don't you ever. - Fucking touch him again. Do you understand? Never again. - Did you reprogram. - The necromancer? Is she good to go? It's not gonna happen. - You can't leave her here. - With them. You have to - destroy her. I'm working on it. Really? Doesn't look like you're working on a damn thing. - You know, - you would not be alive. If it wasn't for me. You were all set to blow yourself up back on Earth. 'Cause of me, you now have a life, you have a son, a beautiful boy, and you have - a future. It's not luck that got you here. It was me. Praise Sol for you, Your Eminence. Where the fuck would I be without you? Hey, Pops. I need your help with something. Father. Yes. Hurry. - We must. - Retrieve the children. Are they alright? Has Campion - eaten anything? Are they... - I'm not authorized. - To process your requests. Please remain still while I prepare you for transport. We missed you, Campion. Don't you miss us? Campion. We miss you. Don't you miss us? Why can I see you but not the others? - Is it because. - You fell down a hole? Is that why? You're all alone now. Look outside and see. Your Eminence. I'm getting rid of her. Reprogramming her has proven impossible. Now? - Why won't you wait. - Until the morning? - Well, Sol has instructed me. - Not to wait. Then let me come with you. She's still dangerous. That is not necessary. - I have the service model. - To assist me. This man is not Marcus Drusus. He's an atheist. A nonbeliever. He's a member of the atheist army. - A weed. - Can you. - Shut that bitch up? He's been deceiving you. He's a traitor to Sol. Clever, aren't they? These machines? You hear that? She's trying to save herself. Yes. She's a tricky one. Mithraic engineering. It's truly a wonder. - A shame. - You have to scrap her. Oh, well. So it goes. And what will happen to this service model after you destroy me? He won't disappoint you. He's as loyal as they come. A fine protector. He was my equal. And will you look after Campion? - He's a well-intentioned boy. - Who's very clever. And resourceful. He would be an asset to your colony. Shit. Slide her in. Let her live. Let her live. Not this shit again. Father, in case you can hear me, - thank you. - For all that you've done. For the children and me. Serving alongside you has enriched the mission. Let her live. Let her live. Let her live. Let her live. - No. - Let her live. - Let her live. - Slide her in. Father? Thank you, Father. I will come back for you and the children. Let her live. Let her live. Mouse. Thank you, Sol. Mom. Mom. Mm. Look. What? Sol brought him back to me. I told you he fell down one of the pits, remember? Oh. You sure he wasn't just hiding in the walls or something? I dunno. I dunno. Your dad's not back yet? I don't think so. Just wait here. Okay. Mom! Jesus Christ. Come here. Paul, go to the barracks. Get me water. Now! Who did this to you? - Caleb, who did this to you? - Was it the necromancer? Okay, listen to me. I've got - everything we need. - I'll get the lander. - Ready to go. - We're gonna head. - For the tropical zone. Do you hear me? We're not going anywhere. What are you talking about? The prophecy... about the orphan boy and the empty land. It's not Paul. It's not the atheist kid. What? It's me. He told me. What? Who told you? Caleb, who told you? Caleb.
