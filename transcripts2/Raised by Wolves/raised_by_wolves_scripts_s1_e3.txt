 I want to go back to the ark. Maybe I can help you. No! Get away! It's okay. There's no need to be upset. [ Crying ] And with the right amount of preparation, one can defend against any threat. That isn't necessarily true. Sometimes it's better to just leave, you know? Go somewhere safe. And we will. In time, we'll start our journey to the tropical zone. But we can't leave until Tempest has given birth. [ Wood creaks ]

 Does anyone know the story of the Three Little Pigs? We're only allowed to hear stories from the scriptures. You no longer need to follow such rules. Stories can be great fun, and they can help simplify complicated con... They don't want to hear it, Mother. It's not going to make them feel any better. Nonsense, Campion. You used to love this story. I lied. I never loved it. Campion. I always thought it was stupid. That's enough! You're being dishonest and disrespectful, and you're setting a bad example for your new friends. Now I will begin. Once upon a time, there were three little pigs. The first little pig was very lazy. So he built a house out of straw. The second little pig worked a little bit harder, and he built a house out of sticks. The third little pig worked very hard, and he built a house out of stone. One day, a big, bad wolf came along and knocked on the first little pig's door. "Little pig, little pig, let me in," he said. [ High-pitched ] "Not by the hair of my chinny-chin-chin," [Normal voice] the little pig answered, to which the wolf replied, "Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in."

Now a virtual body. I gotta admit I'm starting to get a little confused. Sue: Shit, how long do you think he's been there? How long have we been here? They did say that time would be a little weird. Yep. Yeah, they weren't lying. We're his parents. We should go talk to him or something. We're not his parents. [ Humming ] Hey, Paul. Hey. Hey. That's a nice drawing. Yeah. You've got some real talent. I'm just a vessel. Sol guides my hand. Right. Wait. Why are you talking to me? What? You never talk to me. And neither do you. ♪♪ Well, that is because... Because we're in the sim, right? Yes. Yeah, they did say that people would seem a little different in the sim. Yeah, because we're in the sim. Hey, you know what I heard? I heard that there are places for kids to play and stuff on board. Why don't you go see what you can find, huh? Go on. Go have some fun. ♪♪ Marcus: It's okay. No, I can't do this. I can't do it. Yes, you can. I can't. I can't. I can't... be his mother. I can't even be a mother. What? Why? You know why. Okay, just... stay positive. I'm gonna go talk to him. There you go. Now you're getting the hang of it. ♪♪ Hey, buddy, get up. Girl: Goose! [ Children laugh ] Why aren't you playing with the other kids? - Duck... - I tried. Duck... duck... They think I'm weird. Duck... Well, you get that from your mother. Come on. We'll play our own game, huh? - Goose! - Come on. [ Children laugh ] Unless, of course, you think we're not cool enough for you, eh? Hey. Let's go. Duck... duck... [ Imitating duck quacking ] [ Children laugh ] Duck! [ Quacking continues ] Duck! [ Quacks ] Goose! Ohh! Go! Excuse me, children. Look out. Ooh, you can't touch me. Come on! Get him. Get him. What's the matter? You can't catch a goose? [ Quacks ] Come on. Get him. Come on. Ohh! Help! I'm getting eaten by Wally the Weasel! Help. Captain. Are you enjoying yourself? Uh... excuse us. Apologies. You misunderstand me. It pleases me to see a man of war bringing joy back into his life. Our new Eden will never know war. We must master happiness now. It's a new chapter. Praise be to Sol. - Praise be to Sol. - Praise be to Sol. Praise be to Sol. ♪♪ [ Quacks ] - [ Laughing ] [ Laughs echoing ] Sue: Marcus, wake up. [ Inhales sharply ] Hey, hey, hey. [ Grunts ] It's... It's okay. It's okay. It's me. Hey. You alright? You just have a concussion. Alright? You okay? Yeah. Where's Paul? Where is he? He's gone. We got to get him back. The necromancer took him and some of the other kids before the ark crashed. We picked up their locator signals. She's holding them captive. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ [ Breathing heavily ] You know they're lying to us, don't you? There's nothing out there. They just want to scare us so we don't run away. [ Sighs ] They used to tell us that there were serpents in the pits. Then I found out it was just to keep us from playing near them. [ Chuckles ] You see? That big, bad wolf she was talking about? That's her. These reinforcements are not for keeping things out. They're for keeping us in. Father: Time for dinner. Let's go. Let's go. It's time for dinner, Campion. Use the taut-line hitch I taught you. I'm doing it my way. I'm sorry if I hurt you. It was accidental. Nothing's accidental with you two, and you don't feel sorry. You don't feel anything. You're not even my father. You're just a generic service model. Yes, Campion. And that is why I didn't take Mother's eyes. A generic service model cannot fully protect this family. Only Mother can do that. Nothing's out there. You're just trying to keep us from running away. I do not blame you for not taking us at our word, given recent events. I might be worried if you did, but we just want to keep you safe, want to see you grow old. You're just saying that because it makes you seem more real. But I am real, Campion. Forget it. Wait. ♪♪ It's called a claw. It's for catching... and killing. The threat is real, Campion. [ Coughing ] You have fun lying around all day while the rest of us were working? Her body is working to nourish the fetus. Yeah, Hunter. Campion did most of the work anyway. You just sat there. Oh, shut your mouth, Holly. She doesn't have to listen to you. You're not in charge anymore. Who do you think you're talking to? You know who my father was. Yeah, and he's dead now, Hunter. So is mine. They're all dead, and all their stupid rules have died with them. You're gonna burn for that. Oh, really? The come and get me, Sol! Come strike me down! Mother: Stop it! What is wrong with you? Did you act this way in church? Then don't act that way here. Girl: [ Coughs ] What took you so long, Campion? It's my fault he's late, Mother. Of that I have no doubt. Now, let's continue our dinner without any further conflict. We will engage in polite conversation. Perhaps you'd all like to hear... Not jokes! Polite conversation. Holly, please choose a topic. Oh, okay. Uh, Tempest, I was wondering what you're going to name the baby. I don't know what the sex is yet. If it's a boy, I think you should name it Otho. Shut up. What? It's the most respectable thing to do. Shut up, Hunter. He was the Heliodromus, you know, courier of the sun. Just shut up. Oh, go on, admit it. You're glad he picked you. Hey, hey, hey! - Tempest! Take it back! Take it back! [ Coughing violently ] [ Wheezing, coughing ] ♪♪ ♪♪ The atheists must have reprogrammed her to be a caregiver. Impossible. No atheist has ever successfully reprogrammed one of our necromancers. It wasn't successful. She's reverting. It looks like she murdered all her children bar one. And if we don't hurry, ours are gonna be next. Who's to say she hasn't killed them already? The locators can't tell us if they're alive or dead. They're alive. I know it. Now, let me take the soldiers, and I'll go get them right now. I am the highest ranking survivor, Captain. And that is why I've come to you, Your Eminence. Now, please, give me the order. We're not ready to mount a rescue, Captain. Those men are exhausted, and we need to cremate the dead. Your Eminence, the children may not have the luxury of time. Nor do we! If we don't spend this time scavenging for food and water, we're all going to starve. Won't be much use to the children then. [ Sighs ] We have to keep searching for survivors and salvage whatever we can. We will rescue them, but there are precious few of us now, and I have to ensure we do what's best for all. What is it, Den? We found her, Your Eminence. Your wife. ♪♪ Varlac and Voreena: ...as she walks the dark corridor. And forgive her her sins, so that she may join you in everlasting life. Sol, catch this spirit before it falls, so that she may join you in eternity. Shine your light on her... ♪♪ If there's one true line in their big book of bullshit, it's that you reap what you sow. ♪♪ ♪♪ [ All coughing ] ♪♪ You can't let Mother do this. Mother is not causing this, Campion. Then why am I not sick? You are special, Campion. No. Special in a way that Mother and I do not fully understand. There's no point in talking to you anymore. What if I killed the Gen-1s without knowing it? And now I'm doing it again. Mother, you would never do that. You only say that because you have some misplaced belief in me. Your strange mimicry of human love, it makes us less safe, Father, not more. But if it turns out that I'm making them sick, I expect you to assist me in destroying myself. Mother, that I will never do. You would have to. For the children. ♪♪ Mother, wait. Where are you going? ♪♪ ♪♪ [ Shivering ] Caleb. Caleb. How did you explain to them where you got your medical skills from? I told them that I studied to be a doctor while I was in the sim. Okay, good girl. It's okay. No, I was supposed to have been there to protect him. Paul... I should have been there to protect him. Shh. He's a smart kid. He'll figure out a way to survive, okay? It doesn't matter how smart he is if he thinks praying is gonna save him. It'll keep his hopes up. I promise I'm gonna get him back. You believe me? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Come on. Paul: [ Echoing ] And it'll be a city of peace, where only good things happen. ♪♪ And maybe someday we'll make it real. There's at least one orphan boy on this ark that I know of. What? The Pentagonal Prophecy... an orphaned boy in an empty land. That boy is probably Peter Valerius. I mean, both his parents were senior clerics. Oh, I guess we'll have to wait and see. Whoever it is will lead us to the place where it is to be built, and it'll be a city of peace. Come here. Sounds good. ♪♪ Do you think I would have been a good soldier, if I had to fight in a war? Yeah, buddy. You would have been great. But our side didn't draft kids. Only the atheists did that. ♪♪ [ All chanting ] War! War! War! War! War! War! War! Can't hear you! War! War! War! War! War! War! War! War! War! War! War! Are you real?! War! War! War! War! Are you an android?! War! No. War! War! You remember... War! ...your parents died with their eyes open. War! War! Don't fail me, Caleb! War! War! War! War! [ Laughs loudly ] War! War! War! War! [ Boys cheering ] Caleb! [ Spits ] [ Boys chanting "Caleb" ] [ Device powering up ] Move! Caleb. Put this on. What is it? Man: Put this on. Think of it as... turbocharge. [ Screams ] [ Device powers up ] Feel it? Don't fight it. Yes. Use it. [ Breathing heavily ] Go! [ Device whirring ] ♪♪ [ Device whirring, pinging ] ♪♪ Caleb, get back up! Caleb! Caleb! Caleb! ♪♪ Ahh! [ Gunfire ] [ Jets passing overhead ] ♪♪ Aah! ♪♪ Go, go, go, go, go! [ Screaming ] [ Device crackling ] [ Gunfire ] [ Sputtering ] ♪♪ [ Device beeping ] [ Grunts ] ♪♪ [ Grunts ] Milk! [ Indistinct conversations ] For you, Captain. Milk. It's fresh. Mm. Thank you. My name is Lucius. You're Lucius. You fought with my father on Earth in the Battle of Boston. His name was Malius. Yes. Good man. So, you have forgiven him? Is that not what Sol teaches us? Lucius. Yes, Captain? Has anyone investigated the cracks? The impact of the crash must have ruptured the surface layer, Captain. [ Grunts ] Ooh! There is definitely something living down there. And beneath the promised land will be demons. [ Gun cocks ] When the light is shone upon them, they shall be like us. ♪♪ [ Shrieking in distance ] Oh, shit! [ Shrieking continues ] ♪♪ This way! Run! Come on! Let's go! [ Indistinct shouting ] [ Shrieking continues ] ♪♪ [ Shrieking continues ] [ Indistinct speaking ] Come on. Move, move, move. ♪♪ Come on. Orders, Your Eminence? What are your orders? Soldier, see if that will take us out anywhere. ♪♪ ♪♪ [ Metal clanking ] ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ [ Metal creaking, air hissing ] ♪♪ [ Door thuds, metal clanks ] ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ Captain, take half the men, try to lead her off. I can't engage a necromancer in the open. You will be shielded by the armor of Mithras. You have nothing to fear. Are you sure you don't want to save the few Mithraic lives that remain? Maybe send one of your androids instead. I'm sure they'd be happy to make the sacrifice. ♪♪ ♪♪ Voreena, go. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ [ Shrieks ] [ Mumbles indistinctly ] ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ Shh. ♪♪ ♪♪ [ Shrieking ] [ All screaming ] ♪♪ This way! Go! Move! [ Shrieking continues ] ♪♪ [ Screams ] Stop! Stop! [ Breathing heavily ] Back up. Back up. Back up. [ Breathing continues ] ♪♪ ♪♪ She's leaving. ♪♪ ♪♪ [ Coughing ] Father: Paul. Think positively. Human beings are very hard to destroy. It's my mouse. I lost him. I think I know where it probably went. Come on. I'll show you. Come on, Father. Got into the carbos, did it? Sure did. The droppings are all over the place. I can see it. But I can't reach. Move aside. Are you sure it's here, Campion? I can't seem to find anything. [ Door closes ] Campion? Unlock the door. I'm sorry, Father. Campion! Campion, please open the door. ♪♪ [ Coughing ] It's done. Campion, I will break the door down. [ Coughing ] ♪♪ - What's going on? - She's poisoning us. Tempest: What? She's tricked you, just like she tricked me. Her love isn't real. Campion knows where the ark went down. There could be survivors there. But those creatures... Mother can make you see things when she wants to scare you. I've lived here my whole life, and I've never come across any creatures. Father: Campion? It's called serpent heart. Gives you energy. [ Coughing ] Father: Campion! I'm going to count to three! One... ...two... ...three. ♪♪ Campion! ♪♪ Lander online. [ Pinging ] ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ [ Whirring, pinging ] ♪♪ [ Pinging intensely ] [ Humming ] ♪♪ Why is she singing that song? I don't know. [ Humming continues ] Stop. Unless your sister was an atheist, you're singing the wrong hymn. The hymn is not just for those whose souls are beyond saving, Captain. It is also appropriate for those of us who never possessed a soul, like my sister. It is to reassure the living that nothing important has been lost, that Voreena is only material. I don't need reassurance from you, robot. Stop. Is there a problem with my android, Captain? There's no problem, Your Eminence. I thought you men of war enjoyed hearing the hymn for the soulless. Bartok: Yes, Your Eminence, we surely do. We used to sing it after atheist executions. It's the sound of victory, a most beautiful song. Beautiful. I was afraid the sound might bring back the necromancer, Your Eminence. Ohh. Your Eminence, the landers aren't responding. I've tried everything. System must have been fried by the necromancer's siren. There's nothing I can do. Ambrose: We can't stay here. She might return. Pack up all you can carry. We leave on foot. Let's go. ♪♪ I think these are omnibiotics. This is what she was after. This means if she took the meds, it means the kids are still alive. ♪♪ - When can we stop to eat? - Eat what? Girl: We didn't bring any food or water. Campion: Don't worry. We'll find some. I don't feel sick anymore. It's not medicine. It's going to wear off soon. Hunter: I thought you said you knew the way. I do. It's far. Take a day or two to get there. A day or two? Paul: Aah! Hey, guys, wait up. Come on, Mouse. Where'd you go? [ Whistling ] ♪♪ I got you something. Well, what is it? [ Squeaking ] It's a mouse. No, no, I don't want to. I don't want to. Don't want to what? I don't want to kill it. I don't... I don't care if it means I'm weak. I told you we're not like that anymore. I don't want you to kill it either. It's a pet, a pet mouse. Well, it's actually an avatar for a real mouse. It's in hibernation. [ Squeaking ] You know what that means? It means that when you wake up, he's still gonna be there. Did you say a pet? Yeah. That means you got to take care of it. Forever. ♪♪ I want to name him Mouse. Well, that's a very fitting name. [ Chuckles ] So wiggly. Mouse, come on. Hey. Come on, Mouse. Where'd you go? ♪♪ ♪♪ Come on, where'd you go? Ha, I found you. [ Squeaking ] Hey, guys! I found him! Guys? They're on the move. They're on the move! [ Chuckles ] Paul is separated from the others. He's alive. [ Sighs ] Give me the omnibiotics. Your Eminence, the tracker says that the children are on the move. And the necromancer took the rest of the medicine. Now, what more proof do you need that they're still alive? Let me take half the men. And leave the rest of us unguarded? They are children. They are Sol's children. Sol would not abandon his children. Of course not. That's why we all must go and save them. All of us. Great. Captain. You still seem to harbor some confusion as to the chain of command here. It's time you learned your place. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ Campion? ♪♪ ♪♪ [ Screaming ] Calm down! Where are the children? The Mithraic children have locators surgically implanted. They haven't gone far. Campion? Yes, he's with them. Then what are you waiting for? I had to refuel the lander. But, Mother, wait! Mother. Wait. Looks like Paul split off from the group. I'll go after him. You retrieve the others. I was using the carbos to fuel the lander. It won't take the carbos? It will take them, but I need you to listen to me. We tested the carbos, but we never tested the pits inside them. They're radioactive, Mother. And it appears as soon as the carbos are picked, the pits begin to decay, contaminating the rest of the tubor. The Gen-1s were exposed early enough that they must have developed some resistance, which is likely why it took them so much longer to... succumb to the radiation's effects. You see, Mother, it wasn't you. You are a good parent. ♪♪ Omnibiotics. Give them to the children as soon as you find them. They'll help counteract the effects of the radiation. Thank you, Father, for trusting in me. ♪♪ ♪♪ Holly: We lost Paul. It's our fault. We lost him. Do you have any more of that stuff you gave us? Is it the baby? I don't know. It's been hurting since yesterday. I didn't want to say anything because I was afraid of upsetting your... android. Do you really think she's poisoning us? I don't know that she's not. But she seemed so upset, like she was really worried about me. I've never seen an android behave that way before. [ Roaring sound in distance ] What is that? Vita: I told you. I told you they weren't lying. There are things alive out there. No one ever believes me because I'm small, but I was right. Shut up. They'll hear us. [ Roaring continues ] [ Creature grumbles ] Together: I wear the Armor of Mithras and the Light. I am shielded from all that is harmful. I wear the Armor of Mithras and the Light. I am shielded from all that is harmful. I wear the Armor of Mithras and the Light. I am shielded from all that is harmful.
