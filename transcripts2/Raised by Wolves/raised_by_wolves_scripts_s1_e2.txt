 I'm so sorry. [ Grunts ] Thank you. [ Pinging, whirring ] It's an A-Class medical. Looks like he was doing medical exams on Mithraic officers and their families. Mary: What for? They were chosen to go on the ark. All their identifying information is on here. Can these things do plastic surgery? Of course. I'm also proficient in war wounds, crani... Okay, shut up. Yes, sir. We're about the same build as these two. We can get their passes. If we don't get on the ark, we're gonna die, along with everything else on this planet. This android is barely functioning.

He tests us. Can you please try a little harder? What? You're gonna have to be more convincing than that. He tests us. We've gone this far. Can you please commit? He tests us. Wasn't so hard, was it? Mary? Albert, where is she? [ Crying ] Mary? [ Breathing heavily ] I hate it. I like it. Caleb. It's Marcus. [ Crying ] And it's Sue from now on. No! We'll get through this. We wear the armor of Mithras and the Light. We are shielded from all that is harmful. [ Breathing heavily ] This must be it. [ Waves crashing ] [ Jets zooming ] [ Pot bubbling ] Show yourselves. ♪♪ ♪♪ We wear the armor of Mithras and the light. We are shielded by... What? They have a kid. It says he'll be returned to us at the boarding area. Digital pass keys 34, 35, 36. ♪♪ We have a son. Man: Sol, guide us with your brightness and your glory. You, the all-seeing, unconquerable light, may darkness never come. [ Computer pinging ] [ Man speaks indistinctly ] ...so that we may serve... God of the sunset, Dow, descending immortal. - Bless my soul. - ...watches over... God of the sunset, low upon the western main. Dow, descending immortal, immortal to rise again. I think that's him. ♪♪ ♪♪ Hi, Paul. Hello, son. Hello, Father, Mother. Cleric: Captain Drusus. We took good care of him. Thank you. Woman: All congregants, please have your identification passes ready for inspection. Come on. Back in line. Bye, Paul. Bye. ♪♪ ♪♪ Welcome, brothers and sisters. We will pray. We will worship. We will atone for the sins we committed on Earth. And when we reach the Promised Land, Sol will reward us. Sol, deliver us from this ruined world. ♪♪ ♪♪ Hey, you alright? I'm scared. It's alright.

You've had a new processor installed. Now you need to stay calm or you're going to undo all my hard work. If you want me to remain calm, Mother, why did you reactivate me? Your eyes. Hmm? Do they look alright? What? My original eyes had to be removed... for the sake of the children. The children? Yes. Campion, and now five more. They come from an ark called Heaven. Don't worry, Father. We'll get it right this time. ♪♪ [ Wind howling ] ♪♪ ♪♪ [ Breathing heavily ] ♪♪ [ Grunts ] ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ [ Breathing heavily ] ♪♪ ♪♪ Oh, that's much better. ♪♪ You said they threatened to take Campion. I don't want to talk about it anymore, Father. We have much to do, children to raise. Go ahead, Father. Go ahead with what, Mother? You can make a joke if you like. Perhaps later, then. I sense you're staring at me. Please stop. I never lost control. I just drew on a part of myself I didn't know existed. My actions served our core programming objective. You have nothing to be concerned about. I can't weaponize without my eyes. You've destroyed them? No. We might need them again later. So you destroyed me on purpose. There was no loss of control. You were the one who lost control, Father, when you tried going against the mission. And the Mithraic that came here turned out to be every bit as vicious and terrible as our creator programmed us to believe. They tried to kill me in front of Campion, Father. Welcome. ♪♪ ♪♪ [ Chuckles lightly ] Father! [ Chuckles ] Hey. Come with me. ♪♪ ♪♪ Mother said you broke down, that she threw your body into one of the serpent pits. No, we had a fight. She deactivated me. Father, she killed everyone aboard that ark. One of the soldiers said that... ♪♪ ...she was a Necromancer. Father: You don't have to be afraid anymore. She has since disarmed herself. Is that one of your jokes, Father? We have to take charge before she changes ag... ♪♪ What are you going to do with them? How many times did you say that you wished we were a family again? Now we are. I'm sure you must be nervous about fitting in with your new companions. Just be yourself, Campion. Stop trying to act like it didn't happen! It's okay. Sol will protect us. No, he won't. Come on. Pray with me. [ Whimpering ] We wear the armor... Shut up. Sol helps those who help themselves. Maybe we can sneak outta here the next chance we get. And go where? We don't know anything about this planet. Unless I ask you to speak, you'd be smart to keep your mouth shut. We shouldn't fight with each other. We'll never survive if we fight with each other. [ Mouse squeaking ] Mother: Brought food. I'm sure you all must be very hungry. Come and sit. Vita, Holly, Tempest, Paul, Hunter, and Campion. Careful, it's hot. Don't, Vita. Father and I will take care of you from now on. But there is no religion permitted here, Mithraic or any other kind, so before we eat, you will need to give me your pendants. These are weights you no longer need to carry. Thank you. What is most important is that you do not try and leave the settlement. I know you're all very curious about the planet, but if you run off on your own, you'll only end up starving, if you don't freeze to death first. Once you've become acclimated, we'll migrate to the tropical zone where survival will be easier, freeing you to concentrate on building a new, peaceful, atheistic civilization. [ Chuckles ] Come on. Eat up. It's not poison. [ Humming ] Campion. ♪♪ Spiria. ♪♪ [ Blows ] Father: I often replay my memories of the children. We need to make new memories now. I was wondering, Mother, have you sufficiently secured your other eyes? ♪♪ ♪♪ I want us to be able to trust each other, but I also hope you will respect what is mine. Of course. ♪♪ I'm not hiding them from you, Father. I am pleased to hear it. [ Chuckles lightly ] I want things to be as they were with us. So do I, Mother. So do I. Hmm. ♪♪ They'll help keep us safe. ♪♪ ♪♪ [ Shoveling ] ♪♪ ♪♪ Well? Has she destroyed her eyes? If she hasn't, I say we take them, throw them down one of the pits, just to be sure. I'm taking care of it, Campion. Are you sure? I'm sorry, Father. I don't mean to keep questioning you. Never hesitate to question me, Campion. But you have to accept the answers I give and have faith that I will always do what is best for you. I do, Father. Why don't you go and see if you can help those children feel a little less afraid? You think they will like me? Of course they will like you. You're a human, just like they are. ♪♪ You can have these. They'll keep you warm while you sleep. I've never seen kids as big as you before. Mother will make you some special clothes, just for you. They're a little stiff when she first... when she first makes them, but they'll soften up the more you wear them. Well, that's great news. Thanks. Oh, you are welcome. [ Scoffs ] So, what happened to Gabin? How did you know that name? ♪♪ Gabin got sick. The others, too? Yes. [ Mouse squeaking ] It's called a mouse, isn't it? Yes, they're actually born on Earth. And all of you were born on Earth, too? Yes, we're actually 13 years older than we look. We were in hibernation, see? It's so small. We don't have any animals on 22b. Let him hold it. Hunter, don't. ♪♪ [ Squeaking ] [ Laughing ] You want to keep it? ♪♪ No. Can't. It... It is yours. [ Squeaks ] No, it's alright. You should have it. You sure? Yep. Hunter: Your friends didn't get sick. She killed them. She's a Necromancer. They're built for mass extermination. She probably did it without even knowing it. If you think that male android's gonna protect us, forget it. He's a generic service model. Necromancers eat those for breakfast. You see, androids, they were built to protect us, to do our dirty work, so we can stay pure. If they had feelings, they'd be useless. Have you ever seen how they look when they don't know they're being watched? See, the reason why they don't want you to believe in Sol is because they're afraid of what it's gonna open your eyes to, the power it will give you. Do you want to pray with us? You know I'm not allowed to. And neither are you. If Mother catches you, she'll... Alright, maybe you could keep watch, then. ♪♪ Together: Sol, guide us with your brightness and your glory. You, the all-seeing and unconquerable light. Hunter: May darkness never come, and may the dawn go on forever. Help us keep our souls pure that we may serve you. [ High-pitched whirring ] ♪♪ ♪♪ Campion? What? He gave it to me. He was no longer in need of it. Well, you're old enough to know what's best. I don't want you to do those things with your face anymore. What things? The way you look at me. I know it's not real. I don't understand. Yeah, you probably don't. Give it to him. Give it to him! ♪♪ Paul. Sorry. Thank you. Come along. You need to show them how it's done. ♪♪ The carbos grow only where the serpent's bones lay. That is why we named him the Giver. These ones are no good. It's hard finding really good ones. Tempest: We're not afraid of hard work. We're from military families. Unlike him. Hey, I got an IQ of 205, alright? If you want me rolling around in the dirt like slave boy, fine, but it's a waste of my intelligence, okay? 205? Yeah. Are you the smartest in the group, then? Yeah, by far. What about you? Are you sure you're not the smartest of the group? No, I don't think I'm smarter than him. Yeah. Hmm. Hunter, come here. Yeah. Sure. Yeah. Alright, now, listen carefully. Yeah. A malfunctioning android, a Cleric, and a cat walk into a brothel. The malfunctioning android requests an android whore with mechanical skills. The Cleric requests a virgin with the knowledge of the Mithraic mysteries. But the cat... the cat can't decide what to ask for, so he turns to the malfunctioning android and the Cleric and asks for suggestions. The Cleric turns to the malfunctioning android and says, "How is it a cat can speak?" To which the malfunctioning android turns and says, "I am malfunctioning. None of this is actually happening. The cat doesn't exist, and neither do you." [ Scoffs ] To which the Cleric then says, "Thank goodness. For a minute there, I thought I was losing my mind." [ Chuckles lightly ] You see, it's a paradox. I have many jokes tailored for geniuses like yourself. This next one also involves a cat. Yeah, you know what? Um, I think I'm just gonna, uh, work with the others. Yeah. But thanks. Thanks. Alright. Now close your eyes. Close your eyes. I want you to think back to a time before humans gained their sight, when you were all just blind, simple organisms, floating in the vast oceans of the Earth. The warmth of the star drawing you to the surface. ♪♪ [ Heart beating ] ♪♪ Can you come with me for a moment? ♪♪ Campion, continue the lesson until I return, please. She'll be fine. No need to worry. I've taken care of it. [ Wind howling ] I want you to sleep in here from now on. You don't have to work in the fields. You can do house cleaning. You need special care, constant monitoring. There's too much at stake to take any chances. Take chances with what? You have been given the greatest gift that can be given. What's the matter? Am I scaring you? No. It was against my will. While I was inside the shared simulation. The man who did it was able to wake himself up somehow, had his way with some of us while our bodies were still in hibernation. There were plans to execute him. Thanks to you, he probably died a few days earlier than scheduled. I would thank you, but I was actually looking forward to watching him die. He was a Heliodromus, the second-highest ranking member of our church. The thought that there's something part him growing inside me... it makes me want to die. Then you must not think of him. Think only of the child. The child is innocent. I will help you. We'll do this together. ♪♪ ♪♪ Knock, knock. Who's there? Punch. Punch who? Punch line, but I must warn you I am a bit of a disappointment. Not bad. The little one might like it. Save that one. Knock, knock. [ Grumbling sound ] Who's there? [ Bones clatter ] [ Creature hisses ] [ Creature groans ] ♪♪ Sleep now. ♪♪ ♪♪ [ Creature groans ] Tell me you didn't destroy them. Campion. I'll handle this, Mother. Mother, I'll handle this. ♪♪ Tell me where they are. Campion! Tell me where they are. No. You said you would deal with it, but you didn't. You didn't do anything! There are intruders inside the perimeter. We are in danger! Tell me where they are, Campion! No. Tell me, Campion. Tell me, Campion! ♪♪ Stay back! ♪♪ [ Creature chittering ] ♪♪ [ Screams ] [ Shrieking ] [ Creature squealing ] [ Shrieking ] [ Screams ] [ Distorted voice ] Don't look at me, Tempest. Go back to the barracks. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ I think they're gone now, Mother. You should cycle down now, Mother. [ Powering down ] ♪♪ Animals of some kind. We've been here for 12 years. How could we just be encountering them now? A good question. I would study their remains, if you left any. I thought we knew this region and all its dangers, but we don't. Thank you, Father. For what, Mother? For not taking my eyes. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ [ Creatures panting, sniffing ] ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ Man: These things settled around here somewhere. [ Device pinging ] Here. ♪♪ - Come on. - That's it! ♪♪ One, two, three. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪
