 Paul? There's no need to run! If you can hear me, I want you to scream out as loud as you can. You are not safe. Paul? Come on, come on. Aah! Help! Aaah! Aah!

 ♪ Just like love will do ♪ Set me down. Is there a problem, Captain? Set me down. I thought this was a virgin planet, no prior civilization. This has intelligent design... Symmetry. It has five points, like in the prophecy. You'll know them by their shape and their number. The temples in the holy land, where Sol hid the answers to the Mithraic Mysteries. Mysteries... It's warm. Take off your gloves. It's warm, you can feel it... The power of Sol coming from inside. It's warm. Keep your eyes closed, children. I'm weaponized. Mother... you should know that Father saved us. He was very useful, and he helped us, and... It was stalking near the lander. It's mildly aggressive. I have yet to decide what should be done with it. What is your opinion, Mother? I will leave that for you to decide. An unusual answer for you. Father, I am sorry for my... My critical words. I was in error when I told you that your kindness makes us less safe. But you were not in error, Mother. My behavior endangered the children, almost cost Campion his life. And I fear, despite your kind words, I am losing your respect. - Father. - As well as my own. And I lost Mouse down the pit. And... and then I fell and fell, and I thought I was gonna burn up. And she saved me... The necromancer, she saved me. We'd all be dead if it weren't for Mother and Father. The android only showed up because we prayed to Sol. You acted like a coward. We all did. Except for Vita. I can't believe I lied to Father. You're insulting your real parents when you call them that, you know. I never knew them. How can I insult them? You can. They're with Sol in the light. They're always watching you, just like our parents are. Is that where your mouse is now, too? With Sol? No, animals don't go anywhere when they die. Death is the end of them. What are you making? It's a weapon, isn't it? I thought we weren't allowed to make weapons. That is going to change. I'm going to use this to kill the creature so that you and the others can eat it. What do you mean? You can't kill it. You don't want your new friends to starve, do you? No, but I'll find something else we can eat. Just give me a little time. Mother and I have scoured the forest many times over the years. - There's nothing out there. - Yes, but I'm hungry, and it will make me look harder. It will cloud your thinking, if it hasn't already. Just let me try, Father. It's forever. Death is forever when you're an animal. Death is forever for all organic life forms, Campion. Fine. Whatever you want me to say, I'll say it. Just, please, let me try and find something else - we can eat. - It's a waste of time and calories, but if it will help acclimate you to this... -Come on, then. Let's get to it, Father! I thought you destroyed them. I like to recycle whenever possible. I'm sorry they tricked him like that... Your android friend. Father can be very... trusting. But that's good. I had a boyfriend back on Earth who was kind of the opposite. It was exhausting. The powers I possess have only just come to light, and I fear Father may now feel inadequate. Well... can he do things that you can't do? He's quite amusing at times. Do you wish he was as powerful as you are? I want what is best for you, for the colony, for your baby. We'll find a way to make sure that everyone is taken care of. Maybe you could use your mobile lab to bring it to term. Like you did with Campion and the others. Do you know how fortunate you are? I've always wanted a child that came from me. You are a creator, whereas all I'll ever be... is a creation. Well, I'd gladly switch places with you. I'd love to be able to do the things you can. Children often ask for things they do not really want. I'm not a child. What are you making? A scalpel. What? Wait. Wait, no, I... I didn't mean that you should take it out now. Are you listening to me? It's time to sleep now, Tempest. Sleep now. No, I don't want to sleep. Come with me. It's time to sleep now. Sleep now. Hey. Hey, they moved again. - That's it. - No. No, no, no, no. - I'm just gonna talk to him. - You're not gonna talk to him. I'm gonna talk to him, okay? We know how it goes when you talk to people. Excuse me, Your Eminence. The children have moved again. We should mobilize. Sol has left us a gift. We can't leave until we open it. We can come back here after we get the children. As much as it paints me to say this to you, Sue, but it may mean that the children aren't meant to be rescued. We can't jeopardize our holy mission because we're too weak to sacrifice the things we love. No, can you just... Please, do not listen to her. There's no access, Your Eminence! We'll stay here. We'll use the explosives to make an entrance, and then we'll get moving. No! We must be careful not to destroy what's inside. Please. Very well. Captain, breach it. Ensure the troops only use hand tools. Yes, Your Eminence. Chemical composition is unfavorable to humans, potentially deadly. Now, can we stop wasting energy and get... -No. There! I see something! - Can you lift me up, Father? - If you can't get it yourself, it's not really a viable food source, is it? Well? Digestible. Yes? Go on. Favorable composition. Yes? Some caloric value. So it could work? We can eat it? We won't have to kill it. The lander will have to do a more rigorous analysis. But it does look promising. I was wondering if you could take a look at my hand. Of course. It's a nice piece. I was in a band lander accident back on Earth. Keeps seizing up on me. Just needs to be realigned, that's all. To think you left Earth knowing nothing about medicine, now you're its last remaining practitioner. Sol helps those who help themselves. Do you really believe that he won't judge us by letting our children die? My husband is ready to lead the attack, and I promise you he will not fail. Better? Yes. Will you consider what I said? The sun is sunk, the shadowy night is reigning in your room. We pray to Sol, his saving light... ...to guide us through the gloom. You don't know it? I don't think so. Is it from the scriptures? Yes. - I think it's going to work. - I really do. I hope so. - Can I name it? - If you wish to. What was that name of the Earth food that everybody liked? - Pizza. - Yes! I love that name... pizza. What are you doing? Nothing. It's going to work. It's really going to work. Trace levels of hydrocyanide. It's toxic. There's no pulse. Have you finally decided to strip it for parts? Tempest asked if it could be repaired. She wants to use it to carry her fetus to term. I've decided to allow it. Why? She was impregnated against her will. We have six remaining synthetic womb sacks. If we can repair the lab's internal system... Her traumatic stress is treatable. You shouldn't tamper with the natural process. It's like that old saying on Earth, Mother, "Let nature run its course." Nature has no course. I am against it. But I'll leave you with the final decision. I've decided to slaughter the creature we captured. Slaughter it? The children need to eat. There's not much meat on it, but it should be enough to keep them from starving for a few days, until we capture another. Should I kill it now, then? No. I said I would do it. But I can do it more quickly, without any mess. No, Mother. I need to be... more useful. I don't want Campion seeing. It'll pain him. You know as well as I that his sense of empathy is highly pronounced. Yes. And if we don't teach him to mitigate those feelings, it will surely get him killed. Stop. What? - What is that? - What? That! I can't hear that. Aah! What is that? Oh, you can't hear that? What? What? Aah! - You can't hear it? - No, I can't hear it. What's going on? Hold him down. He's a ticker. His mind's been infected by the necromancer. He's not a ticker! He needs medical attention! - He's ticking! - Let me treat him! Just give me a second! - He'll kill us all! - Get off him! Just back off! Give me that! Get her out of the way! Let go of him! Let him go! Sol, catch this spirit before it falls - so he may join you in eternity. - No! Shine your light as he walks the dark corridor. - Please wait! - Just Wait! I said wait! Your Eminence, it's an ear wig. It's one of ours. Captain, look. You trying to get rid of me, Your Eminence? I would never resort to such atheistic treachery. How do you explain this? Well? Go on. See, this man has never set foot on a battlefield. Now he treats those of us that did like we're disposable. If I had fought in the war, I would not be able to carry the light. We all have our duties, our functions. But if you wish to challenge Sol's law, then I implore you, strike me down. See where it leads you. She was gonna kill my husband. She has the Ear Wig transmitter. It was her. They often malfunction when they lose pairing with their siblings. No need to apologize for the accusations, Captain. Your error was understandable. Anyway, it looks like she can still be repaired. No repair necessary. Campion, stop! I'm setting it free. I won't let you do it. Yes. You've changed my mind. You're going to do it. Now, grip this tightly. And when you're ready, jam the spear into the creature's flesh. Then repeat the action until it dies. It will take practice to get over the revulsion the act will trigger, but those feelings will dissipate with practice. You can do this, Campion. It's part of growing up. Then I want to remain a child. Perhaps your new friends will feel differently about this. Mother! Mother! Father won't listen. He's going to make us kill it. You must stop him. You all need to learn how to survive. It's part of the natural process of life. Now, it won't be easy, but I'll be right next to you, guiding you. Now, do not be alarmed. Stop it, Father! What is going on? Why haven't you killed it yet? I'm not going to do it. The children are. There's no point putting it off. We could break down unexpectedly. They need to know what to do. I will handle this, Mother. You don't need to worry. I won't involve Tempest. Not Campion, either. He can continue to eat the carbos. There's no reason to make him do this. I'd also like to spare him from this, but we can't. Give me a few hours. And when you come back, it will all be done. I noticed some debris from the Mithraic's ark in the forest. Perhaps I can find the parts I need to repair the mobile lab. Tempest needs to eat soon. If this isn't done by the time I return, I'll do it myself. Well? Are we setting it free? I'm sorry, Campion. Mother! You know this is wrong. I know you do. You're good, Father. Goodness will not fill your stomach. I don't care. We're not doing it. Easy for you to say, Campion. You can eat the carbos. Yeah, I'm the son of a senior Cleric. I can't kill. That would make me impure. Um, but killing can be done by military families and, uh, androids like yourself. It's for all of you now... if you want to survive. Eventually, Mother and I will be gone, and you will have to take care of yourselves. As your number grows, so will your need for food. So you will begin hunting. Now, one of you, take up the spear, kill it as quickly as you can. You'd better kill it soon, while there's still some meat on its bones. Aah! Got it. I got it. You're causing it to suffer more by delaying its death. They slaughtered animals on Earth for food for thousands of years! I'm going to make you finish this task! Come back here! Now! At least you're not intelligent. I died once. Death can be very unpleasant when you're intelligent. Warning... sim is not intended for android interface. Begin simulation. Warning... sim is not intended for android interface. Welcome, sister. We will pray, we will worship, and we will atone for the sins we committed on Earth. And when we reach the promised land, Sol will reward us. Welcome. We will pray, we will worship, and we will atone for the sins we committed on Earth. And when we reach the promised land, Sol will reward us. Welcome, sister. We will pray, we will worship, and we will atone for the sins we committed on Earth. And when we reach the promised land, Sol will... Campion, what are you doing? I told you children never to play with this equipment. I told you, and I told you and... I can fix them. I can fix them. No, you cannot fix this, Campion! 'Cause these are not broken. These are dead. All six of them dead! And dead is forever! Get out. Get out! - Don't tell them. - What? Gabin and Spiria, don't tell them what they were. Get out! Mother, don't be mad at Campion. He didn't do anything wrong. It was me and Gabin. We accidentally melted the snowballs. The snowballs? Why did you lie to them about what these were? I don't know. They're not any younger than you are. Their capacity to understand is exactly the same as yours. They didn't need to know. It would just make them sad. Are you going to tell them? No. Go ahead. You said you wanted to. Why do things have to die? It is nature. And nature is flawed. Well done. Wow. Batteries. Always come in handy. She's worth more now than when she was alive. See, I didn't know they taught these things at the Mithraic academy. They don't. War took me everywhere. You pick up little things along the way. I fear Ambrose ordered the android to do that to you, Captain. And there are some among us that fear that he has lost his faith. I've sensed that, as well. - Hey. - Hey. Do you know these, uh, lines from the scriptures? It's along the lines of, "The sun is sunk, shadowy night reigns..." - "Reigning in your room." - "Reigning." "We pray to Sol, his saving light to guide us through the gloom." Yeah. Sue, that's not scripture. That's a lullaby. Every Mithraic child knows it. I just wanted to hear it recited. It, um... comforts me. Yeah, me, as well. Lucius, could you, uh, give us a moment, please? Ambrose knows I don't know that stupid lullaby. He knows. I just don't understand why he didn't try and take me out along with you. He can't kill you. He knows they, uh, need a medic to survive. I'm gonna kill him, make it look like an accident. No. No, 'cause it's gonna backfire. There's too many eyes on us. We're just gonna have to go and get Paul ourselves. No, the odds go way down if it's just you and me. Well, it's better than if we stay here. All right. Okay. We'll go before dawn. And until then, all right, you're gonna keep your head down. There's no settling scores. Do you understand? Forget Ambrose. Yes, ma'am. It's barely giving off any heat now. Nothing's coming out. It's stopped. We know the walls are thick, even without the heat. If we can get inside, we'll survive the night. Get the explosives. Go. No! We'll curse ourselves if we harm it. We are the last. Sol wants us to survive. He will forgive us. Back him up, or we're gonna freeze out here. Come on. What are you waiting for? - Place them. - I can't, Your Eminence. Sol is greater than I am. Give them to me. Will anyone help us survive the night? I promise Sol will forgive you. Captain... ...place it. That's an order. Our leader has lost his faith! We are being tested, and we must not falter! I know you're not Marcus Drusus. And unless you want them to know it, too... Sol has shown himself to us today! Ambrose abandoned our people, our children, and this is Sol's answer. This is Sol's judgment! This is his will. It's warm. It's warm! You all right? I heard a voice. Mother? What took... Tally? Tally, is that you? W-Where are you going? Tally? Don't. They're poison. I'm just eating a little. - Hey, what do you think you're doing? - I can't let you. I like you, and I don't want you to die. Hey, kid, why don't you stop playing the martyr, okay? Go on, eat it. We won't judge you for it, will we? Tally? No. - You did nothing wrong. - No. It's for the good of the colony. Now the others won't be afraid. She had a baby inside. It was a mother. It was a mother.
