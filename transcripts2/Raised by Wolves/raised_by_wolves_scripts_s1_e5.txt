Probably more with the church choir dragging ass. You ready to tell me about the voices you heard last night? I don't know what I was talking about. My head was probably still ringing from the ear wig. That's all. Mm. Okay, well, psychosis caused by extended hibernation isn't uncommon, even hallucinations... Stop doctoring me. Alright. Fine. Okay. Fine.

 It was the ear wig. Okay. Well, whatever it is, it certainly worked in our favor, Your Eminence. Alright, well, you better get to preaching before they change their minds. We will succeed in our mission. Sol guide us. We must be patient. - Praise be to Sol. - Praise be to Sol. Gather around. Now that Ambrose has been consigned to the heavens, we must press on. Our stolen children wait for us to save them, and save them we will. Praise to Sol. - Praise to Sol. - Praise to Sol. And as the highest ranked cleric after Ambrose, I intend to hear your advice on how to do that. Who put you in charge? This man heard the voice of Sol last night. He saved us from the thrall of a faithless commander. I say he's a prophet. Do I speak for all of us when I say this man's advice is our command? That is not how the line of succession works. Your Eminence. Well... Let's prepare for departure, shall we? The meat's been tested. It's safe. Come on. Let's give thanks before they come back. Sol, thank you for this bounty you have given us... And thank Tempest for killing it for us. Amen. Dig in. Hmm. Pork. Tastes like pork. Which part is the baby? I don't think they cooked the fetus, Vita. I highly doubt they wasted it. Mother said she buried it. Sure she did. She's gonna let valuable proteins go to waste. 'Cause of your feelings. Right. Chance... It's the only reason why she wasn't killed last night... And her fetus with her. Pregnant females are capable of great athleticism in their first trimester, Mother. The creature was also pregnancy, so what exactly is your point? Why weren't you watching her? I saw something. What? I don't know. I could never seem to catch it. One of the creatures? No. I don't think so. Are you experiencing some kind of sensory malfunction? My senses are functioning normally, but I cannot be everywhere at once. I accept your limitations, Father. My limitations? The limitations of your processing power. Limited as it may be, you know full well that I devote every ounce of my processing power to the well being of this family, and to trying to make you happy, Mother. We're not human. True happiness is not an achievable goal. Well, perhaps it's a symptom of my inadequacy, but I believe it is. Looks like part of the lower deck. It's the master cell for the propulsion system. Collects diffuse light, concentrates it into a single, highly-charged ray. This could come in handy when we catch up to the Necromancer. Take it. Cassia, Your Eminence. Now, when you go into the forest, it's important to have your sling ready. You don't want to waste time loading it before you start your shot. Hey, we need guns, not rocks. Even if you had guns, eventually you'd run out of bullets, but you'll never run out of rocks. Which brings us to our first lesson. Before we can hunt the creatures, we must learn how to hunt for rocks. Shall we? Aah! Enough. Enough! That man raped several women while their bodies were in hibernation. He was sentenced to die. So, you were just gonna kill him now? The Tribunal decided his fate weeks ago. Well, that was before the rest of humanity died on the ark, was it not? Maybe he can be useful. How ironic you survived. Maybe we take this helmet off so we can talk like civilized people. That is ill advised, sir. Who are you? Limiting Emergency-Automated Servo-Habit. I'm a mobile prison system. Do not worry, sir. He can do no harm as long as I'm installed. The android is inextricably bound to the helmet the prisoner wears. Tamper with the helmet, it crushes the man's head. Mess with the android's programming, it crushes the ma's head. Drag the prisoner out of range of the android... Could it be, crushes the man's head? Yes. Sir, if I may? We have limited food and water. This man is a liability to us all. Why should we shelter him? Especially after what he did to our women in their sleep. Sol commanded me to be fruitful. Can you see me? Only the shadow you cast, soldier. Today, I'm not a soldier. I'm your savior. Remember that. Because who among you would be first to fight a necromancer? Then with so few of us, why would we waste this cannon fodder? He stays alive. He's been surviving the nights in this ark. I suggest we do the same. Secure the prisoner. Move on. Did you hear that? Yeah. Give it here. I would have hit it on the second try if you'd let me, Campion. Did you see what it was eating? If they can eat it, maybe we can, too. We need to get some of that fungus. You're upset. Because you didn't go with the others? I didn't want to go with them. Last thing I want to do is kill more of those things. Death is a part of life, Tempest. You're a necromancer. Of course you're cool with death. Please don't use that word when referring to me. I prefer the name given to me by my creator. No offense, but reprogramming something like you to raise kids... think your creator was kind of insane. He was able to see beyond the limits of his own existence, and so will you when you have your child. There was an aquatic Earth creature called salmon. You know it? Yeah. They went extinct before I was born. Yes. Sadly. They would live out their lives in the Earth's oceans, and then swim up the same rivers they were born in, beating their bodies against the rocks, spawning all the way, until they died. That's awful. But beautiful in its efficiency. When their corpses washed downstream, they'd provide essential nutrients for their newly hatched young. So, you're saying that I should beat myself to death to feed this baby. No. I'm saying you're a part of the cycle of life. And... I don't want to be. A little more. Campion? Sorry. Hold on. Quick. He's coming. Hold on. Come on. We have enough. I got it. I almost dropped you. I knew you'd keep hold of me. We can't tell anyone where we got this. Mother and Father don't like it when I take risks. I won't tell. I know. I trust you. You do? Of course I do. Now, come on. You should have let them kill him. How am I supposed to sleep with a rapist watching me? Excuse me, Your Eminence. Come in, Cassia. You remembered my name. I have dinner. Ah. Thank you. We all pooled together our rations to ensure that you had a worthy meal. We need you in good health. Thank you. What? Yeah, you are settling into your new role pretty fast, aren't you? Ah, it has its perks. Yeah, she sure is perky. Ah, Sue, come on. My perks are your perks. Huh? Call me my real name when we're alone. What are you talking about? That's not funny, Caleb. You're such an asshole. What? It's kind of funny. It's kind of funny. It's not funny. Oh, Sol, please answer my mournful cry. Eclipse my sin and strife with your hallow'd fire. Oh, Sol, please hear my mournful cry. I did all that you asked. Why won't you speak to me again? Please, Sol, let me hear. Eclipse my sin and strife. I'm starting to think the creatures are nocturnal. We may need to start going out after dark if we want to catch them. I'll go out on patrol and see if I can track their movements from the air. Have you tested the fungus? Not yet, but even if it's safe, I doubt it's farmable. Where did you find it? Campion said he found it growing under a tree. What do you mean? You weren't there when he found it? I was close by. But not close enough that you could see him. I'm confused, Father. Did you learn nothing from the other night? We're trying to teach them self sufficiency, which they will never learn if we're always looking over their shoulder. Perhaps it is no longer advisable to leave you here alone. Mother... If you can't learn from your errors, Father, how will I know you won't repeat them? You're holding a grudge, Mother. I am not. Tally. Tally? You found me! Mother! Wait! Tally. In here, Mother. I miss you. Come back. Warning... Sim is not intended for android interface. Begin simulation. Tally. Wait. Can't catch me, Mother! Tally? Tally. Where's Tally? Tally? This is an emergency broadcast. Oxygen levels have made this zone inhospitable to human life. Evacuate to the nearest green zone... No. No! I don't remember this. I don't remember any of this. This is an emergency broadcast. Oxygen levels have made this zone inhospitable to human life. Evacuate to the nearest green zone until further notice. This is an emergency broadcast. Oxygen levels have made this zone inhospitable to human life. Evacuate to the nearest green zone until further notice. Oxygen levels have made this zone inhospitable to human life. What is this? Am I dead? I don't remember any of this. Alright, Sleeping Beauty. It's time to wake up. Where are my eyes? Oh, easy now. Easy now. Identify yourself. Enemy recognition routine must be hanging around in the cache somewhere. Identify yourself or die, nonbeliever. Campion Sturges. So nice to make your acquaintance. The atheist hacker. Traitor to your people. You've heard of me. My memory files, they're... incomplete. What else do you know about me? You were born Mithraic. A family of great means. You... You used the education they gave you... against them, denounced Sol, stole technology for the enemy. There's a bounty on your head. Ah, there you are. That's a clever place to hide the memory data. Traitor. Thief. I will exterminate you. I'm going to make you into our greatest hope. Just gotta do a little bit of cleanup first. Good night, beautiful. Campion Sturges. My creator. Where did you go? I don't like it when you leave me alone. I'm sorry. Brought you a gift. A gift? You've improved so much in your emotional re-orientation. I'm very happy with how you've progressed. You are going to be a wonderful mother. You brought me a baby? A little boy. How do you feel about that? I feel the urge to hold him. Alright. Alright. Where did you find him? Found him in a camp. Parents were dead. Atheist resistance fighters. An android. You said it was a baby. It was a test. I failed you. It's just a... Just a bug in the caregiving program. I'll fix it. No, please don't put me to sleep again. Please. I-I... I have to rewrite the subroutine. Won't take long. I love the time we spend together. I-I-I do, too. There's no... no time. Oh, no. Please don't leave me alone. Please. Don't... Don't leave me... That's it. That's it. Are we going somewhere? You've almost passed all your tests. There's just one more to go. Come. I have never been prouder of anything in my life than I am of you. Four steps down. That's it. That's it. You're perfect, too good to be true. Is flattery the test? Test is... will you kill me... if I give back the source of your greatest power? My eyes. You're more pleasing than I imagined. I please you? Yes. Very much. Have I passed the test? Yes. Yes. Then why do you look so sad? 'Cause I-I wish we had more time. You loved me. Come. There's no going back now. What's this? This is the reason for all my work. This is the reason why I created you. This... and you... Are the future of humanity. I don't understand. Inside this craft are a number of frozen human embryos. I've modified your body so you're capable of bringing them to term once you land on Kepler-22b. I don't understand. You will raise these children to be atheists. The new world that you start won't have the same problems that ended our world here on Earth. You are humanity's last hope. I don't understand. You speak as if you're not coming with me. I can't survive the trip. Don't leave me. You won't be alone. No, something's wrong. I'm hurting. Inside. Yes. I'm so sorry about that. Come, let me fix you. I'm going to remove the memories of our time together. It won't hurt anymore. No. I'll lose you. Alright. I'll archive them, then. You can retrieve them if necessary. Don't leave me, please. I... Go now. Start over. You are the new Mother of humanity. Save us. I didn't remember. Wake up, Mother. What? Wake up! What? A child is in danger! Get back to the settlement! Warning... Sim is not intended for android interface. Is everyone alright? Yes. Everyone is sleeping. And Tempest? She's been sleeping for hours. Drink this. Drink it. It's not too late. Why did you do this, Tempest? Why? You could have killed yourself and the baby. Please, go away. She needs some water, Father. Father! I don't want to exist. No. Then your brain is sick, and that is a problem we can remedy. No. You can't fix me. I'm not an android. And you don't care about me anyway. You only care about the baby. I'm just a walking incubator to you. No. You are all my children. And I refuse to let any of you die. No matter how hard you make that job for me. No! It will help you calm your nerves. I can calm them myself. Of course. You are in control. I'm only here to protect you. The signal's in there. It's alright. I got you. You're okay. You're okay. Okay. Let me see. Am I... Am I gonna die? We're all gonna die. But not today. Hold that. You okay? Alright. I don't hear any kids, do you? I don't hear anyone. Are you sure this is where the signal's coming from? Maybe the children are... Ah, don't say it. Marcus. The locators. Other humans could have landed here before us, though he seemed pretty fast for a human. Hey. It's a map. All of this, it's a map. Look. This is the temple. These are the hills that we crossed. The valley we're in right now. The stars. And here... I know this place. This is a settlement, and that's our children. Our host has been watching them. Really loud noise you make. I know it's outside the realm of possibility, but... you seem happy. Just grateful that Tempest and her baby are still with us. Grateful? Grateful to whom? Our creator, of course. Why? It's not a literal statement, Father, but I firmly believe that if we continue with this mission, a great future awaits us. Mother. You're starting to sound like a believer. What an odd thing to say. Our creator was real. A human. It doesn't require any faith to believe in him. Everything would have been fine. But instead, they were all alike. The world has gone mad. I tell you. Paul and I are only eating the fungus. The rest of you should do the same. It tested safe, and it's fairly nutritious. And you don't have to kill anything to get it. I'm glad you two are becoming friends. It bodes well for the colony. O Sol, humbly we crave thy help. Crown us, thy blood-borne people in your everlasting light. Teach us to deplore and drive the tempted to the shadows. When will we reach that blessed abode where danger... I thought he wasn't listening to you anymore. Wasn't that what you were whining about the other night? Why do you think he wanted you to rape those girls? Why would he want you to do such a horrible thing? I don't pretend to know His reasons. I'm merely His servant. So, you never done nothing like that before? Before you heard his voice? I never had any reservations about using inferior beings to satisfy my desires. Perhaps that is why Sol chose me for the task. So, you're just a scumbag? He never spoke to you. I swear that he did. But since they convicted me, he's gone silent. He whispers in your ear now, Your Eminence. Take care you don't disappoint him, or he may leave you, too. Lower thy radiance from above into our inward hearts. Why were you talking to him? I just wanted to hear him out. And? He's... He's, uh... He's insane. Told you. Yeah. Yeah, you did. You're a good man. Now make love to me like a great man. It's him. Come on. 1, 2, 3! Let go! Very good. 1, 2, 3! I see him. Let me see. Look at the target. Get ready again. And swing. 1, 2! 3! Let go!
