 You've tested me. You know that I am not wicked, that I... am your one true servant. You chose me. Vindicate your king! Show me the way! Thank you, Sol. I'm coming, Paul. Your king is coming. Mother. We're getting close.

 Should have a visual soon. Looks like a bad place to have a baby. Do we have to go there? Don't worry. We won't be here for long. As soon as the delivery is complete, we can start for the tropical zone. What is it? Picking up some movement. What kind of movement? Creatures. Look at that. It's infested. We can't land here. - I concur. It's gonna be alright. It is Sol's baby.

 We're on a holy mission. Nothing can hurt us. He's right. But I do think we should land somewhere else, Pops. The baby is moving. Wait. Looks like they're scared of the lander. Land near the pit. It'll keep us from freezing. Prepare for landing. Alright, you can come out. Are you sure this is the place? Yes. This is the place. I don't want to set up too close to the edge. Grab your stuff. We're moving. Thank you. Stay close. This will do. It's not going to hurt you, is it? The birth, I mean. I'll be fine. You don't have to worry about those creatures coming back. I've gotten quite good with my sling. You have to let me show you. I throw a rock with great velocity, as Father says. Soon. But I must spend this time recharging. Okay. Is it going to have powers like yours? Do you think it will be able to fly? It's possible, yes. Hey. Hey. Can you give us a second? Want to run some tests on the baby. Sure. Campion isn't happy. He's probably feeling insecure. It's pretty common when a new baby comes into the picture. The other kid gets jealous of all the attention. He'll get over it. And Father? Uh, well, I don't know about androids, but humans get, uh, jealous sometimes, and it can cloud their better judgment. Jealous? Of my baby? No, jealous he didn't help make it. I just want to test your amniotic fluid. It should help us determine how close you are. You're warm. Yes. My internal temperature has risen considerably in the last 24 hours. It's still gestating. It's getting close, though. Holy shit. Cellular growth is off the charts. This is gonna be one badass baby. I want to do a test every couple of hours, okay? I think Paul is right. Mother's pregnancy... It has to be divine. It's all true. I saw a temple with pentagonal sides, just like in the prophecy. Are you serious? Yeah. I should have died when that guy forced my arm into the hole, but I didn't because Sol saved me. You're full of shit. No, it was a miracle. You see? Sol saved us, too. Check it out. It's Romulus' tooth. It survived the crash. We saved ourselves, Holly. It wasn't that stupid tooth. Do you really think Mother's baby is divine? Yeah. Yeah, I do. Sol probably wants us to bear witness to its birth so we can write about it in the new scriptures. You guys have lost your damn minds. No, he's right. Maybe Mother took us from the ark for a reason. Maybe Sol has been working through her all along. Go on. Stretch your legs. Do some pooping. Hey. Hey, where'd you... Where'd you go? Mouse? Hey. Hey, get out of there. Come on, get out of there. Hey. Mom? You're mad at me, aren't you? For hitting you with the sling. Quite the opposite. I was worried that your outsized sense of empathy would be detrimental to your ability to survive. But look at you. You've become something of a warrior, haven't you? So have you, Father. Come to dinner. Go on. There's one here. I've got it. Come to dinner, Father. I need to ensure that we have enough bio-fuel for the next leg of our journey. Are you jealous of me? I would like to know more. About what? Exactly how this pregnancy came to be. I was reticent to ask at first, as I found the subject... oddly disturbing. I even tried deleting the thoughts eliciting from my working memory, but for reasons I can't comprehend, the... thoughts keep returning. Alright, then, I will tell you. Very well. I think I mentioned I found a functioning hibernation pod amongst the ark debris in the forest. Yes. You accused me of following you there. Yes. I was mistaken. I was direct-interfacing, using it to inhabit my own memory files. You should have told me what you were doing. I would have liked to have done the same. I do enjoy reviewing the memories we've both recorded together. Yes. I found some very old ones regarding our creator. Our creator? But we have no memory archive of that time. He didn't archive them for you, Father. Only for me. And when I accessed them, I triggered something, some kind of hidden program that allowed me to... interact with our creator... in the now. What sort of interaction? We communed in a virtual space. And while we did, information was downloaded into my drives. Instructions for how to build a new kind of being. It was as if my sensors began to multiply, and my programming seemed almost infinite. You mated. Yes. Yes, Father. It was extraordinarily pleasant. I wish you could have... What's wrong, Father? I haven't even told you the upsetting part yet. I disagree, Mother. The idea of you mating with someone makes me feel oddly displaced. I see. Well, what are you waiting for? If there is indeed something more upsetting that you need to share, please do so now. It is regarding our mission. It is something that I've had a great deal of trouble processing. Our creator told me that Campion and the rest of gen-1s were only practice. I-I don't understand. The mission, Father. He told me that raising them was only to prepare us for this. This child... growing inside me... ...is the mission. W-What I have come to realize, Mother, is that our mission is for us to determine. No one else. That is a childish thing to say. We taught them to believe in themselves, not a God! That terminology is not amusing, Father! Well, it seems my ability to amuse you has waned over the years. Like your propensity for human melodrama, which has increased exponentially. Well, I won't let you down on that front, Mother, as I do believe I've had enough. I see now that my well-being is of no concern to you. Perhaps it never was. Where is he going, Mother? Hmm. Father! Father! Where are you going? I'm afraid I've reached a point of intolerance with Mother, Campion. What are you talking about? You can't leave! Father! Where's the lander? I need to find my kingdom. Answer me. Or do you want to die? Yeah, I do. Anything is better than this. He never saved me. He just wanted me to suffer because I crossed you! You are his one true servant! Will you look after Mouse for me? Where are you going? I can't tell you that. It's a surprise for Mother's baby. It's alright. He's not evil. Promise. You and your surprises. One word out of you, and you're going into the pit. So, the equation as it stands is this. I can't take care of the children without being around Mother, but being around Mother now causes me to feel angry, which makes me incapable of taking care of the children. So... what is the answer? Yes. That is the only solution. Hey. Why do you have Mouse? Where's Paul? Paul asked me to watch it. Do you know where he is? Something about a surprise for Mother's baby. He was right. About what? It's not evil. Glad to hear it. Paul! Paul? Paul! Paul! Paul. What are you doing? What were you doing? - Nothing. - What were you doing in there? Huh? - Nothing. What's in your bag? I know it's not Mouse. Let me see. You pull this out of the lander? You were gonna throw this in the pit. You know we can't fly without this. We'd be screwed. What the hell is the matter with you?! Going to the tropical zone is a bad idea. It's not safe for the baby. Really? What do you know what is safe for the baby? We have to stay on this side of the planet. Where is this coming from? Huh? Who have you been talking to? Sol told me. What? At first, I thought it was Mouse. But it's Sol. I can hear him. You can hear him? Not in my ears. In my head. And then he brought Mouse back to me to show me how much he loved me. He told me so. Hey, what's the matter? Don't cry. No, you know what this is? You overheard your father and I talking about the voice he was hearing, didn't you? That's where this is coming from. - Yeah. - Yeah. I'm sorry. You need to listen to me, alright? There is no Sol. He doesn't exist. What? You told me when I was little... You told me he was real. I know. I used to believe, too. I did. I... I just don't anymore. Your father, he didn't hear Sol's voice. He... He went insane. Do you understand me? He was sick inside. But you're not like him. You're nothing like him. Your mind is strong, and you can do anything. But it is you, alright? It's not Sol. It's you. - Sorry. - It's okay. What am I to do with this child? What is its purpose? Can't you make me understand? You've done improbable, perhaps impossible, things before. Why not now? Mother! Don't worry, Father. He's dead. Perhaps the creatures are evolving, like the humans did on Earth. But then why haven't we found more like this one? And why did it try to kill me? What is it? It's a Neanderthal skull. Extinct human variant. Displaced by Homo sapiens on Earth at least 40,000 years ago. Maybe the Mithraic brought it with them. One of their relics. It's not from Earth. Carbon composition is definitely local. But if humans existed here, where have they all gone? They're not evolving. They're devolving. This planet has a history, Mother. A history I fear we are dangerously ignorant of. You should have this baby somewhere else, somewhere of your own choosing. There's something wrong with this place. No. I felt it since we arrived. I feel stronger here. Will you promise not to tell the children about our discovery? Given what they've been eating, I have a feeling this might cause them some... ...distress. Yes, Mother, and it will be an easy promise to keep, as I plan on having Hunter erase my memory files in the morning. Why? After what you relayed to me, I cannot be in your presence without experiencing a great deal of what I can only describe as human anger. An emotion I know you have some familiarity with. Yes. But by deleting all memories of our time together, I can start anew, Mother. I will retain my behavioral model, but I feel confident I won't, as you say, "mimic human love for you" a second time, as I don't believe this version of you will inspire the same feelings the version I met 12 years ago did. You will lose your memories of Campion. We can make new ones. All the jokes you've generated will be lost. Incorrect, Mother. They will live on in your memory. That is, unless you haven't purposely deleted them. I am not your enemy. Do you hear that? Hear what? Someone... Are you alright? Is it the baby? No. I think my auditory sensors are just too keyed up. Mother? Shit. Shit! Mother! Mother! Oh, shit! Quick! Get up! Get up! Everyone, get up! Come on! We have to go find Mother. Quickly. Come on, get up. Get up! Up, up. Liar! Hey, hey, hey! Relax, Paul. Don't. I know what you really are. Paul, what are you doing? Put it down. You're not my mom. I am your mom. I need you to take a second. Just listen to me. Just stop, please. She and that man killed my real mother and father, took their faces. Sol told me that! You're a demon. An atheist demon! Well, aren't you? Tell them. I said tell them! I'm sorry, Paul. You're not sorry. You're evil. And now she wants to harm Mother's baby. She wants to stop the miracle. Don't you, Mary? Tell them. I'm trying to save it, I swear. You're lying. I know you're lying. Sol... ...guide my hand. Uhh! Paul! Paul! I'll get him. I'll get him. I'll get him. Come back! Come back! - Breathe, okay? It's gonna be okay. Find Mother. Tell her the baby has to come out now or it's gonna die. Go! - Let's go! Let's go! Whooah! Aaaah! No. Aaaaah! Where is my baby?! You said it... Aaah! Ugh! Aah! Mm. Mother! Mother! Mother. The baby needs to be born now. Mother?! Mother! Mother, where are you? No, Campion! Stay away. It's me, Mother. Is it alright? No. - Let me see it. - No. It wasn't our creator. Something else put this inside me. I am so sorry, Father. As long as it's suckling, we're safe. But it grows, and I fear that once it has drained me from my milk, it will want blood. We'll throw it in the pit. We can't. It flies. But I can make it fall and make sure it doesn't come back in the lander. And I will never be anything but a creator of death. I will kill it. You're too weak to pilot. I can manage. No, we can't risk failing. I will assist you. It's a chance to be useful, Mother. It would make me happy. Mother! No! Mother! No!! Mother? Aaaah! Unh! Ugh! Mother! Campion! Tempest! Aah! Campion and the others will be alright without us. Yes. They will help one another. Campion will lead them. He was always destined for it. Yes. Goodbye, Father. Goodbye. Paulie. Can't be. Get on your knees. Aah! Hello? Who is this? The king of this world. You're impure. Sol doesn't want you here. Heed my warning, or you will suffer his judgment. We know your ark crashed. You're not exactly in a position to be making threats. Bye, now. Pray with me. OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
