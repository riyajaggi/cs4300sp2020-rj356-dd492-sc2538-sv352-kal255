 Original Subtitles by honeybunny Resync'd/Adjusted by CookiesMonsta Salt Lake Power's ruled out any possibility of a gas leak. What do they think? Somebody turned water into 200-proof gin? They dont know. They've turned it over to ATF. They dont have a clue what's going on. How far from Greenway lab is this pool? - About 4 kilometres. - Anybody hurt? - No. Everyone was fine. - Tell ATF if they want to be helpful, they can send us soil samples from an 8km radius of the lab. You think 11234 could travel that far from lab ? Dust in the wind, Wes. You tell me. I'll ask for a 10k radius.

 What happened to all the bottled water? You can have mine. - Are you feeling dehydred? - Yes. You think the cyanobacteria is turnin our fluids into hydrogen gas? Fuck what? No! You don't think that's what happened to scientists? We dont know what happened to scientists. Yes we do. They combusted. Cyanobacteria needs a power source. It needs energy in order to turn water into hydrogen gas. There's no ball of sunshine inside of us. Well, maybe we have something else. Something that was in the air. In the dust. Something we touched or breathed in.

 Power source in the dust. - What? - Dust in the wind. Shit! What? Yeah, I'll be right down. Fuck! - Who else has it? - Agent Hicks. - 4 other ATF agents. - Bob? Everyone who was on site. We found 1123-4 cyanobacteria but what we don't know is what the hell's keeping it alive. There's no sunshine in your body, David. But there a ray of hope in my head - 'cause I found something. - What? The fuse to the time bomb, I think. Geobacters. All the sunshine cyanobacteria needs. - What are we talking about? - Geological bacterium. - It's around since beginning of time. - These things can live anywhere. Under the Antarctic ice. Top of Mount Everest. Even deep in the dust around a secret Utah lab. Now get this. Recent discoveries suggest that when these little guys eat, they give off a minute electrical charge. And this has been documented? Derek Lovley, UMass Amherst. Take one, pass them around. So it's a living fuel cell. All the energy... that 1123-4 needs to survive inside the human body and work its magic. Energy in a black hole. Geobacter. Here's what I'm thinking. These things are everywhere out in the world, right? Usually they're way deep down. So somehow, the ones in Utah got stirred up to the surface. Now you've got your power source, right? Like a match ready to strike. Somehow someone came in contact with them and unknowingly brought them into the lab. So the lab is contaminated with Geobacter. The scientists would've never realized they were even carrying them. And then along the way while they were working with 1123-4... they somehow came in contact with it as well, accidentally ingested it. See they're working with a controlled bacteria. They know that it can't survive without sunlight or an energy source so they relax, they fuck any biohazard worries - and they basically fuck themselves. - So what happened? 1123-4 and Geobacters are inside of them. 1123-4 can generate hydrogen gas from the water in our bodies. Geobacters provide the energy source. Somehow they ignite. But they need a spark, a Bunsen burner, maybe a cigarette. The lab explodes. 1123-4 escapes in one giant sneeze all over the desert. A nano mistake with global consequences. So how do these Geobacters and cyanobacteria come together? They have a syntrophic relationship. Can't live without each other. The Geobacter can't survive with a lot of oxygen. Cyanobacteria eats oxygen creating an O2-less bubble around them with an increase of hydrogen, right? Cyanobacteria needs energy to live. Geobacter makes plenty of it. They basically attract each other like flies and shit. I'm gonna call the ATF, I'll get them to put up a quarantine around the lab. No-go zone, 10k perimeter and we need to get the soil samples, okay? If we can't contain this thing... Let's just find out how much trouble we're in Wes, okay? Got it. What is it, Bob? If the Geobacters are inside the dust in Utah, that means that they're in you and me. Very likely. You wanna take the rest of the day off and dwell on it? - I'll prep the soil samples. - Thank you. - What?! - Real sensitive, Sandstrom. Fuck Mayko, they're probably all through my guts too, okay? Look, it's really simple, okay? We just need to break the chain. We kill either one of these bugs and the hydrogen gas production inside us stops! What about out there? If we can't figure out a way to kill this thing then we're all fucked! I think we need to get David and Bob to a hospital. It's a good idea but David won't go. He's so stressed out. You know this thing about his dad, right? - Of course. - Apparently he's really getting to him. What did he say? Something about how his father won't stop pushing his buttons. - David. - What! Do you want to talk to the money behind Greenway? Titus Muyerbridge represents Auflander Docheimer industries. That's the company that underwrites the science at Greenway. Yeah. - Mr. Muyerbridge? - I'm here. I have David Sandstrom for you. Hello, Dr. Sandstrom. Thanks for all your help. Who are you guys? ADI is a diversified global opportunities venture capital fund. We specialize in energy, environment and nanotechnology. Impressive. Why'd it take so long to find you? We're passive investors, not hands-on operators. You get to stand well back when the shit hits the fan, is that it? - What are you talking about? - I'm talking about 6 dead scientists. I'm talking about 6 ill-equipped, ill-prepared kids. They were extremely talented PHDs in their field. I guess they've blinded by money at the end of the tunnel because they cut corners and released a doomsday nanobug. I can see you have a flair for the dramatic. Auchtung, you're not listening. How much money are you throwing at the scientific community? How many other slipshod labs are you financing out there? Auflander Docheimer is investing close to a billion dollars in 12 countries. 37 different projects. Look... We respect our scientists. - We don't over and micromanage. - Or impose safeguards? Invest in appropriate containment? - Insist on peer oversight, review? - You're being inflammatory. I'm being realistic! You cant just go throwing your money out there without a clue of what you're doing! Science isn't a goddamn light bulb glowing in the dark, anymore. We're able to play with the fundamental rocks of existence. Rocks that can crumble with the mistake the size of an atom! We try to look at it much more optimistically. The only difference between you and a jackass is the way atoms are arranged! It's a pleasure talking you both. Good luck with your... investigation. One final word of caution. Everything that was taken from the lab is legally the property of ADI. Fuck you Titus! You're wearing a big soggy diaper full of shit and I am gonna pull your pants down on the 6:00 news. Watch for it! Get back to work! I'm out here. I figured you'd be gone by now. Well, you figured wrong. I'm not leaving until we work this out. You keep me here for a reason, David. - Yeah? - Yes, you do. You keep me here to remind you of an uncomfortable truth. - Really, Dad? - Yeah, really. The explosion in your lab. You never really got to the bottom of it. Why? Because bureaucrats in Washington fucked me over, Dad. Fuck 'em back! Can we just drop this? We've been over it a 100 times. Then why won't you just say "Goodbye, Dad. Have a nice trip." Why do you make it so hard for me to leave? Because. Say, you want to take a little walk, go down to the café? Watch the pretty girls go by? Drink a beer? I'm tired. Yeah, well, of course you are. It's been a rough 6 months for you, hasn't it? Dealing with all this crap? Saving my mind with prion injections, the lab exploding, all your friends dying. I'm just tired, Dad! - Tell me something I don't know. - Did you sleep here last night? I said tell me something I don't know. I retested the throat swab. And you found the Geobacter. Carlos, something i don't know. I compared the first sample to a new one. Yesterday the counts were 200 cells per milliliter, today, 340. Hang on a second. Hang on, hang on. How many hours ago? 14. I think that you and Bob should be in a hospital. Fuck that shit. So that's 12% per hour. 7. You need to be somewhere where we can monitor you hourly. I don't need monitoring. I need to know when we're gonna pop! There're many variables. It depends how much 1123 you were contaminated with, how quickly it's replicating. I don't know, okay! This is why a hospital is the best place for you to go. How much time do we have?! I'm working on a formula, David. But it's hard, I'm worried. Then don't drink water Bob and don't smoke cigars! What about static electricity? What about light switches? Somebody on the street lighting a cigarette, candles at restaurant. Fine! If you're that worried about it, check yourself into a hospital! The rest of us will figure this out without you! I analyzed the soil samples in and around the Greenway lab. Please don't worry, David. I found Geobacters in all the samples and 1123-4. Right out to the edge of the evacuation zone around the lab. - Bob. About before. - What? I'm fine. We still have a chance to contain it though. I was thinking of some kind of foam but it can't be petroleum or water based. Geobacters thrive in that. Maybe a neutral powder. Okay so 7% per hour. - Maybe a tarp. Or plastic. - 7% per hour. That'd be a lot of plastic. Still need a spark. Here's what we need to do. We need to inject this in mice - and compare the timeline. - I've already done that... Where are the results?! For fuck sakes. I'll go do it again myself! Come on. Come on. - There you go. - David. Stay away from me, I'm a fucking time bomb. Tick-tick-tick. Don't disappear into this, okay. We need you. Tick-tick-tick, Carlos. Let me take you home. You can sleep a little bit... You want me to take a swing at you?! No, you don't wanna do that. Leave me the fuck alone and let me see how long it takes for this mouse to fry. There you go. That's it. You okay? Sorry, I didn't see you. Got a lot on your mind? Yeah. How about you, Mayko? How're you doing? He's such an asshole, Carlos. He's scared, Mayko. When David's scared, that's all he knows how to do. Just be an asshole? It's been a long, long journey. Yeah. Really long. Who's there? - These are nice. - Don't thank me. They're from Carlos. - Thank you. - You're welcome. How was the funeral? - I got drunk. - Oh God. Then I hit Wes. And then I got drunker. Well, did you at least put a Cala Lily on her grave for me? Course I did. - Good. - Does it make you feel better? She liked Cala Lilies. Well, just so you know I like sunflowers Just so you Know. Careful, Sandstrom, your time's gonna come and oh boy them gods of fate - are gonna get you good. - Them gods of fate? Listen, if there are gods of fate and they ever have to contend with me, - they'll be shaking in their boots. - Shaking with glee. Shaking... with glee. - What is it? - Aeromonas virus 31. And it destroys cyanobacterium? Look what the virus did to the cyano cell in less than 20 minutes. Gone. And it didn't harm any other cells? Well, that's one problem. And it's gonna take a while to find that out. - How much time do think? - How many different cells in the body? 1,345 at last count, grouped together into 3 different tissue types: epithelial, mesothelial, endothelial. Which are then sub-classed - in thousands types of cells. - Grand total, a million plus. Yop. Take a while. But the bigger problem is: how is the Aeromonas gonna target that particular cyanobacterium in that maze? - What? - We don't have to target 1123-4. Not the cyanobacterium. The nanodots. What if we... What if we... Engineered it into... If we put it... Look, the nanodots are iron. So, we have a unique target. What if we...? We need to talk to David! Nanopredator? Not only a virus that can infect and hold the bacteria but is also designed specifically to target the iron nanodot on its surface. - A magic bullet. - This is good, Bob. It's good. Nanopredator, this is all really good. What are you thinking? We somehow find a way to target the metal catalyst - with a nanopredator virus? - Is it possible? Why not? We know the atomic structure of the nanodots. All we need is to find a bacteriophage that would bind with it and it alone. So we create a nanopredator bacterial virus that will seek and destroy only cells with nanodots. Exactly. Okay, that takes care of us. What about Utah and you know, the rest of the planet? We have to put the nano-predators into the environment, but... - you could never get rid of them all. - We don't have a choice. 1123-4's already in the environment, so if we wanna keep it in check. David, you're talking about a whole new ecology. Well, yeah, if that's what it takes. Nanodot vs. nanopredator. We're gonna change the fucking rules 'cause all the rules were broken. I'll get right on producing enough of the nanodot to do the experiment. I think I have everything I need. I'll get plenty of virus available to start the scrape. - That's all I need. - Bob? You're gonna be fine. Thank you. I know. She's my Mom. Can you page her again, please? Jeff! God. What are you doing here? I gotta talk to you. Are you alright? No, Mom, I'm not. It's okay. Dad says I have to stay at Hamstead, no matter what. Julie Henshaw is still walking around free. Julie did not kill Tyler. Yes, she did. I know it. Half the school knows. - The police know it. - No, not according to the DNA tests. I know you think she's innocent. I talked to the Rodmans at Tyler's memorial. They said you cleared her. What the hell is that about?! DNA tests don't lie. She threatened Tyler. I heard her. So did everyone at school. I know. But you know that saying something and doing it are 2 completely different things. Then look at this. - Jeff, I... - Just look. What'd you just say to me, you little prick? What'd you just say? - Get that fucking thing outta my face! - You killed Tyler! Say it! Fuck you! How you'd like a trip to the hospital? I'll get you one day! - Did you show that to Dean Miller? - For what? She'd get a slap on the wrist. She's a fucking senator's daughter, who you're letting get away with murder. That is not true. All I did was read the data. Maybe you didn't read it prop. - Hey Bob. - Who's this? This is my son Jeff. Hi, Jeff. I have a cousin named Jeff. He's a banker in Barrie. He has a dog. She's gonna have puppies. I think I'm gonna get one. So you're here to see what your mother does at the shop? - Sort of. - You headed for science, too? No, I wanna be a D.J. Oh cool. K-os, Killers, Massive Attack? Yeah. Rachel. I'm gonna need those virus batches tonight. - Yes, they'll be ready. - Sure. David. What the fuck? How the fuck did you get in here? The door was open. I've been calling you. Would you people stop? How much are you drinking? I don't need a fucking wife, alright? Are you still on anti-depressants? I don't need any fucking antidepressants. David. - You're going to kill yourself. - No, I can't help it, Carlos. It's in my genes. - David... - Look, I'm fine, okay! Would you leave me the fuck alone? I'm just... I'm just tired! I think you should come back to the lab with me. Why? I think you will be safe there. Where I can keep an eye on you. The lab doesn't feel like the safest place in the world these days. David! She's dead. David. Let's get you some sleep. Lie down. - Jeffrey. - Don't do the "Jeffrey" thing. - Look at this! - I have seen it. Look at it again! What'd you just say to me, you little prick? What'd you just say? - Get that fucking thing outta my face! - You killed Tyler! say it! Fuck you! How'd you like a trip to the hospital? I'll get you one day. What'd you just say to me, you little prick? What'd you just say? David. - I have some news. - No more bad news, Bob. I think I figured it out. What? Tell me. In the mice, Aeromonas virus killed the cyanobacteria. Mayko has a model of it. But I have a problem. What? We don't have much time, David. Shit. We'll work it out, Bob. We'll work it out. Come on, let's go see Mayko. - Tell me it's gonna work. - In theory, it's gonna work. We modeled it after a T4 bacteriophage going after E. Coli. That's good. We know that works. I didn't have any problem synthesizing the nanodots from 1123-4. So we selected a T4 nanopredator which honed in on the nanodots... - And in goes the nanopredator. - In theory. - Yes. Kick-ass science. - Thanks. We're making progress. Progress? You got it. There are still some bumps to smooth over. It delivered it's DNA into the cyanobacteria, instructing it to produce masses of nanopredator viruses. - And it multiplied and multiplied. - The process took less than 20 minutes. What's the problem? We don't know what happened to the virus after it killed the bacterium. It did what all viruses do. It waits there or it looks for a new target. Well it should, but we can't find it and we can't prove that. We have a toasted mouse that didn't get the T4 and a happy mouse that did. I don't see what the problem is. They're trying to say that we don't know what else the virus will do in the body. Who gives a fuck? If I analyze your gut right now, I'd find a trillion viruses. It's the most abundant thing on the planet. You're scared? It either works or not. Wanna see Bob burst into flames? - David. - What? - We're all into this together. - No, we're not! No, you're not! Mayko! You don't have it! Bob come with me! David. What the fuck is going on around here? Where is it, Bob? - Where is it? - Calm down. - The sample you used on the mice? - David, what are you doing? - Stop it! - Is that it? Yes, but we don't know... David! David! David ! Hold on, you're going to be okay. David, do you know where you are? What time? It's 3 o'clock. I've been out for 5 hours? 29, David. So what happened to the bacterium? - You're not dead. - But it worked? Took way too much. Perforated your stomach lining. How bad? Not bad enough that the doctors couldn't fix it. We were able to monitor your hydrogen production, come up with the exact dosage. You neutralize it? I injected Bob this morning. He's taken the vaccine to Utah. How is Bob? He's overseeing the cleanup. Working with a team of engineers from U of T trying to find a way to put the agent into an aerosol spray. No, I meant... Well, I must've freaked him out pretty badly back at the lab. Yes. I explained to Bob how sick you were. Good. Alright then... - Let's get outta here. - David. I think... - I think you should stay. - Why? You're not sick because of the cyanobacteria. I had them do a toxicology on you. When you came in, you were legally drunk. They found Sertraline, Citalopram and Escitalopram in your system. Just take me home. - David, I... - Please. - I don't think it's a good idea. - Please. Just take me home. Alright, sit up. Julie Henshaw? Julie Henshaw? I'd recognize you anywhere. Those eyes. Bit different. So? You wanna tell me why you assaulted my son? You're a dangerous person, you know that. - You have anger issues. - Bark my hole, lady. I think you were responsible for Tyler's death. - Headline, lady: "No, I'm not!" - And I did one of the DNA tests. So then you know there was no match, twice. But there's that all circumstantial evidence. You assaulted my son. Everyone knows you're homophobic. And you're clearly an unstable person. I'm gonna need another sample and I'm all set up. We can do it right here, right now. Get real. If you don't give me a blood sample, I'm going to take this video to the Dean's Office - and I'm going to have you expelled. - I'm so scared. That the way you want to play it? Fine. Jeffrey don't. Leave her. You little prick. Running home to mommy? - You think you can do what you want. - Fuck you! - She's going to bounce you outta here. - Bullshit. She's just a fucking bitch. - She's my Mom. Watch your mouth. - Why don't you watch your back? Fuck you. Asshole. - You okay? - Yes. Think I have a future in science. I think you do, too. Good work. Thanks for the lift. - Look, I'm just gonna crash, so... - Yeah, I'm staying. We need to talk. - Man, don't fuckin' do this. - Sit down, please. David. Sit down. - David, you are a mess. - I know, I know. But... I'm gonna... I'm gonna get through it. Yeah. It's been 6 months. Why do you put up with me? Why don't you just let me go? Because it's time to stop running. You're right. I know that, I know that. But I can't. I just... I just keep thinking, 8 of my people died and - I walked out of there without scratch. - That's not what this is about. Don't. Please. I know what you've been doing, my friend. I just need a little more time, Dad. A lot on my plate these days. The lab's a total fucking disaster. I got a funeral to go to every time I turn around. You don't need any more time. I can't do it right now. Alright? I gotta do more research. I don't know what'll happen. You know what'll happen if you don't do it. C'mon, they're making discoveries about Alzheimer's disease - all the time these days. - So are you. We just don't know enough about prions. There's some evidence that suggests that yes, - they could be used to improve memory. - So. Improve mine. There's other evidence that suggests they could destroy your brain. Roll the dice, David. I'm just an old man. - You're my father. - What have I got to lose? No more booze. No more pills. David, it's been 6 months. You have to face this. - I can't. - You have to. Dad? I was going over Mayko's prion studies. Dad, I want you to come to work with me today. Take some blood. Do some tests. Come on, Dad. Rise and shine. Dad! David, listen to me, listen to me. You did not kill your father. He killed himself. Help me. I'll get you all the help you need, my friend. I told dad I don't want to board here any more and he freaked out. He's under a lot of stress these days, sweetheart. Don't take it personally. I finished those tests. I'd like to go over the results with you. Just a minute. - Hey, Bob. Right there. - Thanks. Did you see that Auflander report on Greenway? - That was insulting. - Total white wash. Greenway was a rogue lab. We gave no funding approval for research in transgenic process of cyanobacteria. - How do you think David's gonna feel ? - You're gonna tell him? I think that's Weston's job. - I'm back. Shoot. - Okay... I'm downloading some stuff onto your screen. - Got it? - Yeah. Got it. Alright. That's the DNA profile of the spit police retrieved from Tyler's jacket. Okay. Now I'm gonna overlay the DNA from Julie Henshaw's blood sample. See that? They don't line up. But, but she did it! Now here comes the DNA from the spit you collected. - Yeah. - I'm gonna line 'em up spit-to-spit. And look at that. - A perfect match. - She did it. She killed Tyler. Yeah. Yeah, she did. Not much to celebrate is there. He's gone and... Her life's down the drain now, too. I still don't get it. Spit matche, blood doesn't. Why? She doesn't have a sister, does she? She's an only child. Then she's a chimera. - A what? - Chimera. It's 2 fertilized eggs fused together in the uterus. Only there isn't fraternel twin, it's 2 distinct sets of DNA come together in one person. It's rare, but it does happen. How can you have 2 sets of DNA in one person? You'd be a freak. Not so much of a freak. Really. Her blood, brain, liver are developed by one set of DNA while her saliva, lungs and ovaries another. How'd you figure that out? What'did you just say to me you little prick? What'd you just say? It was those eyes. Those different coloured eyes. I don't know if I can do this, man. They're gonna make me get in a circle and hold hands with total strangers. Whatever it takes. The fucking cure sounds worse than the disease. David, sometimes you have to listen to other people. Sometimes other people know more about you than you do about yourself. Well, I hate that. You wanna spend the rest of your life in freefall? No. I just, I love single malt, you know. And I love good weed. I love bad weed. Go in there and let them tell you what to do. Okay? One step at a time. God, you think you'd know if you'd gone too far? David, you're going to be alright. You think you'd know. Okay. Here I go. Look, - promise me one thing. - Anything. I come out there, I become total boring prick, you'll tell me? it's too late for that. - Good luck. - Thanks. We have 4 hospitals saying it's West Nile and 3 saying it isn't. These people don't know each other, the transmission has to be food, place. That narrows it down to a couple thousand types of virus or bacteria. They lost another patient. She didn't even last an hour. - Herb Kinsman got the axe. - So who's in charge? Man named Carl Riddlemayer. So what's the game here, Carl? It's all about sharpening the tip of the spear, Dave. - I'm just do this thing with Angie. - Who? Angelica Starov. I'd like to talk to you about Owen. She fixes addicts by messing with the biology in their brains. Owen, the science is way off. My first challenge is to cut 3.8 billion dollars out of science budget. - What the hell is going on here? - Excuse me? Science is on the verge of unlocking the secrets of life! And you're thinking about amputating the only organization that's actually minding the store! You're insane! All of you!
