 Downstream... It's where we're all headed, rich and poor alike. Out in the flow, who does not feel the current tugging? Sometimes powerfully, sometimes gently, always insistent. The most natural of progresses. Until the day you learn... What you had somehow known all along... That not all of what tugs you downstream is inevitable, that resistance is not futile, that you have accepted long enough,

 that you have no choice but to summon up every ounce of strength you possess and turn against the current. Wait for me. Sorry, Jimmy. I don't know what got into me. Good of you to apologize. I guess I figured this thing between us was gonna get worse. No, I wouldn't want that. Well, hell, come around and... Come on and set a minute... sit, I mean. You're right about that. Old lady lampley used to Mark that with her red pen, remember? Yeah yeah. This is more like it.

 Me and you just talking. Nobody bent out of shape. - I saw the kids earlier. - Yeah? Yeah, all heading out for pizza, they said. - A couple more years, they'll be in college. - Yeah. Imagine? A Minty in college! What's so wrong with that? I'm glad to hear you say that. I wasn't sure you'd approve. Why wouldn't I approve? Tell me... tell me something. Did you feel out of place there? At college? Yeah, in the beginning, I guess, yeah. - But like how? - There were kids there from all over, you know... Portland, Boston, even some from New York. Yeah yeah? One morning, I remember I woke up and I... And I said to myself, "this is my bed. This is my room." This is my world." After that, I... It was empire falls that began to feel strange. Well, now you explain it that way, I think I see what our problem is. See, I've never felt strange in this town, not one minute in my whole life. - Laugh all you want, Miles. - I'm not laughing, just shut up a minute, I'm trying to explain something here. Why don't you take your hand off the doorhandle? You can spare me five minutes. Okay. See, I cared who won that game today, and maybe to you that makes me a nobody, but Mr. Empire falls, that's me. Last one to leave, turn out the lights. This town is me and I'm it. And you know... but the thing is that people like you, Miles. They... they do. But you know what? They like me too. You know what they like best about me? They look at me and they see theirself, they see the town they grew up in and their first girlfriend. And you know what they see when they look at you? That they ain't good enough. And they know that they're never gonna get nowhere with you. Me? Maybe. They might just get someplace with me and that's why they like me. Which is why I'm probably gonna be the next chief of police. People like my attitude, I guess you could say. An attitude like yours, well... That sort of attitude just leads to things. That's all I got to say. Are you threatening me, Jimmy? - Am I threatening you? - Yeah. Threatening you? When have I ever wanted to be anything but your friend? Good night, Jimmy. Hey, baby. Where but empire falls would the whole town celebrate a tie as if it were a victory? Thank you. It was your mother who told me it was okay to love him if I wanted to. That what a woman feels deep in her heart is her own business. This is an adventure, Miles, and maybe we'll meet somebody nice. Charlie, slow down. Faster. Faster! Everybody deserves a chance to be happy, don't you think? And there comes a time in your life when you realize that if you don't take the opportunity, you will never get another. "So we beat on," boats against the current, "borne back ceaselessly into the past." Miles? Miles? Miles! You're okay? Cover for me. The holy gospel according to Matthew. Grace, welcome home. - Hi, Tina. - How was your trip? - It was so wonderful. - I wish I could afford to go on vacation. - It was like a dream. - I don't suppose you heard the news, - being so far away and all. - What news? Old Mr. Whiting is coming out of retirement to run empire textiles, the shirt factory too. And C.B.? They're shipping him off to Mexico to run the factory down there. His wife kicked him out is more like it. - Grace, I don't know what we're gonna do. - My god. I don't know if it's just gonna be the factory workers or if it's gonna be the office workers too. You know why. I know you don't have a choice. I don't either. Mom, you're all right? Will you find a new job? It looks like I'll have to, won't I? The black sin, a stain on your immortal soul. You must make amends. Mom, are you all right? Because I said so, Miles. It's not something I wanna do, it's something I have to do. Honey, I've done someone a terrible wrong. And... And now I have to make it right. It's called a moral duty. And one day you'll understand. When will you be back? I don't know, but I want you to stay here, okay? Okay. I love you. Honey.. Did you think something bad happened to mommy? Nothing did, sweetie, okay? The lady that I went to see, she offered me a job. Then why are you sad? I'm not. I'm not. And you know what? I think we should go home and celebrate. What do you think? How about hamburgers? Yeah? Okay. See you next Sunday. Thanks so much. Good to see you, bless you. Thanks. She doesn't love, Miles. She doesn't love, she only understands love's power. The decision is yours, dear boy, but could you do that? Could you let her die knowing you just walked away? How many meals did you serve at your height? Capacity is 150 between the bar and the dining room. - We could lose the pool table and get a few more... - Yeah. - Tables in here. - Yeah. Let's get a little more light in here maybe, but you know... We could maybe lower these, make these windows bigger. What an idea! What's that? Is that a walk-in cooler? - It is, it needs relining. - Great. - Any chance that works? - I'd be guessing, but I think no. Some major expense items, but... It's not that I think it's a bad idea, Miles. Like I told you, I'm game. But it's gonna mean war. That woman will come after us. Fuck her. Let her come. Miles. Hey, Brian. 'Morning. You look good. Thanks, boss. I'm working on it, - laying off that hard stuff. - Good for you. - Hey, Tick. - Hey. Just the person I wanted to see. - Hi. - Hi. - Decor. - Sorry? The walls in your grandmother's restaurant. You're gonna take down those poker-playing dogs and the singing trout? I'm thinking of nicely framed photos of the town... You know, enlargements... when the mills were working, people were working. Working people, just for hard labor and then all decked-out for Sunday dinner at the hotel. Sort of a celebration of the people that built this town, instead of those who think they did. What do you think? - I like it. - It's not too hokey? Just hokey enough. Gin! - What?! - What? What?! - Gin. - Can't be. That's not the same suit. - That's what I thought. - "Anything's possible"? Yeah, I got your a gin card right here. Any chance we could go to Boston this weekend? The Picasso exhibit's opening. I'm gonna be pretty busy here. I'd like to get some of this worked out. Well... anymore... You're always busy. Yesterday I asked if you wanted to proofread my english essay. - I said I would. - And? John, you can just... You can just go in. I'll tell you what, if you can convince your uncle David to flip eggs on Sunday morning, - I'll run you down to the Picasso. - Okay. But you've got to do something for me. Your mother really wants you to be bridesmaid. Okay. What changed your mind? Yesterday you were gonna be boycotting the wedding. We worked a deal. I got E-mail. - That's extortion. - Yup, it works too. Yeah, well, not with me it don't. I don't need extortion to work with you, you just give in. Did I mention that Donny and his parents are visiting Boston this weekend? Another Picasso lover this Donny? Hi, John. I think Brian needs some help. Well, you're right, there he is. Same time every day this week. When his shift finishes. Hey, Bill. - Thought you could use a piece of pie. - Thanks. - Let me know if you need anything. - Thank you. He tells me he thinks your brother's selling dope out of the restaurant. It's got nothing to do with my brother, it's me. So what's he got against you? It's hard to explain. Try. He seems to remember us being friends once. Maybe we were. I hear bea's planning to start serving food again over at Callahan's, and you're helping her get ready. Yeah, she's my mother-in-law. Still, she'll be competition for you here. Unless you're planning to join her. None of my business. Except I don't think I need to remind you that your friend out there doesn't do much without the say-so of your other friend across the river. All right. I'll talk to him, but my advice is that you work this out between you. Under the circumstances, I'm not gonna be much help to you. Why not? You're the chief of police. Yeah, but my days on the job are numbered. What do you mean? - I've got cancer. - My god, Bill. Don't you tell a living soul. What the hell. I've had a good run. You're getting treatments? What do you think is killing me? The old lady must be out someplace. Can't be. They don't have a car, remember? Why doesn't she turn on some lights? All I know is I'm not breaking in. It's not breaking in if you had a key. My dad's. They open everything. We get caught, we just say the door was open and we were looking for our buddy John to hang out. No way, man. You go. You're a pussy. - Hello? - Hello, dear boy. - Mrs. Whiting. - Big doings, I hear. - How is that? - Well, there's no secrets in small towns. Your divorce is final, is it not? And your ex-wife is remarrying. The Robys are the talk of the town. Is it true that you are going to be giving away the bride? Look, it's been a long day. Can we have this conversation tomorrow? Yes, and we'll sit down and discuss what's... Developing. Perhaps we could revisit the subject of that liquor license that you were so keen on. And discuss your future. And your daughter's future. Incidentally, if you were to run for mayor, would it be as a democrat or a republican? Independent, Mrs. Whiting. Well, that is a doomed strategy, dear boy. However, it's all up to you, of course. Yes it is. Goodbye. What I'm trying to explain is... And I wouldn't even be telling you this if I didn't know you and Mr. Comeau are getting married... Is the extent to which your fiance's assets are leveraged. I mean he is fully extended, mortgage-wise. You're saying he's broke? No. I'm saying he has no money. No money? How dare you? Show me where it says that on there. No, show me! You're talking about somebody else. You show me where it says that. - Janine, I'm... - you think you can sit behind this desk, like you're smarter than me and say things about my life? - I didn't mean to intimate I was smarter than anybody. - I don't have to sit here... - I'm gonna tell him. He's gonna come here... - Will you please... - and bench-press you! - I have customers... Would you loan $100,000 to people like us? - Yeah, sure. - Definitely, definitely. Janine, Janine! What's that all about? Janine! What a beginning. Damn it! Good afternoon, miss Roby. You have your license, registration, proof of insurance with you? - I don't know. - You don't know. You know how fast you were going? How fast was I going? Fast enough that you're gonna get a citation. I think we have everything we need. Our loan committee meet on mondays, which means we should have an answer for you - early next week. - Good. - Great. - Great, thanks a lot. - Thanks, Matthew. - Miles. - Say hello to your mother. - I certainly will,Bea. Mrs. Whiting, please. Mind if I sit in, Mrs. R? Certainly, Zachary. Anyone interested in art is welcome in my class. Except us. Hey, John. How's your grandma? You're one lucky dude to have someone like her taking care of you. Why don't you just go away? John, your girlfriend's taking your side. How's that make you feel? Does that make you feel good? Okay, I'm nobody's girlfriend. Excuse me. You know, things are really looking up for you there, John, with a new girlfriend and all. Did you take her to meet your grandma yet? You think she'll like Tick, your grandma? Did you write this? "Where is John Voss's grandma?" What about these? No. Charlotte Bowen. That's her name. Next time you write one of these, you can use it. Like I said before, I didn't write them. You have a key to this office? Because each one of these notes was left in the middle of my desk. - No. - If I searched you right now, would I find a key? You can't search me. You can go. So where is John Voss's grandmother? See you. Bye. How's it going? Fine. We could have given your friend a ride. - Candace. - What? Her name is Candace. So you and your dad are going to Boston Sunday, that'll be fun. How come you never ask me to proofread your english papers like you do your father? And you never tell me about those silly mistakes people make on their signs. You never think they're funny. - Try me. - No. I'm not smart enough to see what's funny, is that it? You always get them, you just never think they're funny. - Maybe they aren't. - Then why do you want me to tell you about them? Maybe I don't. Maybe I'd just like us to be friends again like we used to be. Maybe I'd like you to ask me to some damn art show instead of your father. Maybe it'd cheer me up to know my own daughter liked me. The silver fox isn't cheering you up? - You get out! - What? Get out! You want to treat me like shit, you can damn well walk. Stop stop, stop it! Stop the car! What are you doing? Stop it.. - Okay, wait wait, what happened? - No. - Will you stop? Just let me help. - No, let go! Stop it! - Come back! Come back... - leave me alone! All right, fine! Shut, god damn you! God damn it! Hey, big boy. Three free months. My final offer. - Hey. Hey. - What? Let me ask you something. You're gonna move this operation over to Bea's? Why would you think that? You're over there more than you are here. I was just wondering. - Yeah? - Miles Roby? You know your wife's on Lake Avenue, screaming obscenities and kicking her SUV? Hold on. It's for you. Hello? - You don't dress like one. - Come on. - Shit. - It's okay. You know, I've known for a while. You know, I'd wondered why you were doing so good. Then I saw you a few times, so... Well, just so you know, I wanted to tell you, but charlene, she didn't want to hurt your feelings. It's good. Yeah? Yeah. Really. Thanks, bro. - I mean it. - Hey. You do know I'm woman enough for both of you. Right? That's an extra $10,000 worth of work here. Your electricals all gotta come up to code. You're lucky you haven't had a fire in this kitchen. - Hi, Bea. What's all this? - Looks like the ceiling's buckling. Hi, Miles. Excuse me, please. Been an interesting day. This morning I got an offer on the place. The place has been on the market for three years. Today, I get both an offer to buy it and a surprise inspection. - Power and control. - Miles? Come in here for a minute, please? One of the new ranges is gonna go in here? Yeah. - Is this your house? - Otto, I got a bad feeling here. According to the hospital, Charlotte Bowen was admitted with pneumonia two months ago. When she was released, they gave her half a dozen prescriptions that were never filled. Also, there hasn't been any electric, water or phone service in there since September. - So you think... - No! I'm trying not to. First thing I need to do is talk to that boy. He left school between classes, he hasn't been seen since. I asked my boy if he wrote those notes and he didn't. So how come you people always gotta blame him for everything? - What people are those? - "What people are those?" You, coach towne. - Getting him suspended from the team for no reason! - He wrote the notes. - Yeah, yeah? Prove it. - Jimmy. - Knock it off. - Jesus Christ. Hey, chief, you should see this. There's like three dogs buried back here. There's something down here by the river! We found a woman's body! It's right here. It's what I was trying not to think. Everything's coming apart. I know it must seem like that. They'll find him. He can't have gone far without a car. - What'll they do to him? - I don't know. I don't think he meant to do anything wrong. He probably just figured if he told anybody that his grandmother died, they'd send him away and he's had a whole lifetime of that. Why does everything have to suck? It's a rule. Hey, Donny's coming. You'll see Donny in a couple of days. That's not gonna suck. - Do I still have to go to the wedding? - Yes, you do. I talked to your mom just a little while ago. She feels really rotten about what happened. About trying to kill me? Any chance you're exaggerating? Maybe a little. I need my official taste tester. Janine? Do you? You're goddamn right I do. Well then, you leave me no alternative but to pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride. You may do more than that, Mr. Comeau. Thank you. No way. You've gotta dance one song with me. - Thanks for coming today, Miles. - Sure. You're probably gonna think this is crazy. We're gonna be going our separated ways, - I'm kind of worried about you. - Why? Don't take this the wrong way, it's good you're going for it. You be careful of that woman. I'm just going after what I want. Isn't that what you've been asking me to do for 20 years? Terrific. I get remarried and now you decide to listen to me. You didn't have to come alone, you know. - Are you trying to make me feel guilty? - Who would I have brought? I don't know, I kind of had this idea you might want to bring Cindy Whiting. You took her to homecoming, right? - Yeah sure, there you go, clam up. - Janine... I wouldn't blame you if that's what you're thinking about. For Tick's sake, one of us should end up rich, right? The way Walt talks money, you'd think he'd have some. Yeah, but you married him anyway. He loves me, Miles, and that's the thing I need most. When he looks at me... I don't even know how to say it. See? Hello. Where is my social security check? What? I said, "are you going to send me my social security check?" How could I do that, dad? I don't even know where you are. I'm down in the keys, where do you think? - Care of captain Andy. - Where is father Tom? Right in back of me, he's taking confession, I think. You know he finished second in a Hemingway look-alike contest? He's got a beard now. It's come in all white. How could you do it, dad? Let him grow a beard? Why shouldn't he? You know what I mean, take money from a senile old priest. I never took a dime. No, you just let him pay for everything. Why shouldn't he have a little fun? Old men like to have fun too, you know. - Down here, people like old men. - Why? You know we left the parish station wagon at the public landing in Camden. Ought to still be there if they haven't towed it. Congratulations, now you lost me. Tom and I sailed down here, on the Lila day... crew actually. You want me to believe that you and father Tom crewed a schooner from Camden, Maine, all the way to the Florida keys? Yeah, us and three or four other guys. Tom fell overboard once, but we went back for him. After that he was more careful. He remembers better than most people give him credit for. Do you have any idea what will happen to you if he gets hurt? Not a damn thing. You know what you're pissed about? I'm here and you're there. Have it your way, dad. I will. I do. Hiya, kid. You're home. Good eye. You grew about two inches. Mom's real sick. They usually are at this stage. She didn't tell you? You're gonna have a baby brother. Or a baby sister. What, you grow two inches and suddenly you're a smart ass? Where is your mother anyhow? Church I guess, she goes every day now. She must be feeling guilty about something. - Captain Andy's. - Yeah, you've got an old guy at the bar with crumbs in his beard? Max. Yeah. I got a question for you, dad. How come you never told me about mom and Charlie Whiting? How come you never told me, son? Hey, David, I've been telling my reporter friend here that you missed a hell of a reception. Yeah? Well, something about the occasion just didn't stir me. - I'm gonna sneak out... - I am not believing this. White limos. Hey, big boy. Big boy, come on, take a look at this. - Look at this! - White limos. And look, look... Massachusetts plates. - I told you everything's possible. I told you! - Yeah, yeah. Empire grill. I just heard from the bank. Our loan's been turned down. On what basis? They turned our loan down. They declined to give a reason. When I pressed, I was told we might want to check who's on the board of directors. Fine, we'll go to Portland, or Boston if we have to. That's not all. - Liquor control was just in here. - Liquor control? They had a photo of Tick sitting in a booth with some half-filled beer glasses that I hadn't gotten around to clearing. They said there'll be a formal complaint alleging that I'm selling to minors. She's got us, Miles. No no, she doesn't. She's going too far this time. - She's gone too far. - Who's imagining things? Not me. Where are you going? Don't be stupid, we need to think this through. What is it you don't understand here? I understand you need to calm down before you confront her. - And if I had two good arms... - yeah? Be glad you don't. No, I'm sorry, David. It's just you've gotta step out of my way. All right. No you don't, not today. No more running, big boy. You've been running your whole life. But you're not gonna run today. Me and you are gonna go right here, right now. Come on. You know what? You're right. - Goddamn right I'm right. - When you say go. Go! My arm, my arm. Damn! That was worth waiting for! My arm. I think you broke my arm. Mom! This here is private property, Miles. Are you on duty, Jimmy, or are you just another citizen? - She said for me to tell you tomorrow. - She knew I was coming? There ain't much that lady doesn't know. She's several steps ahead of the likes of me and you. She's kind of disappointed in you is my impression. I'm sure she'll tell me all about it. How about that? Old Miles Roby committing a violent act. What will people say? My advice... Just sit back down, Miles. Just sit back down. - James! - You go on along, Mrs. Whiting. I'll finish up with this here after I've caught my breath. I just came by to give my two weeks notice. You're gonna have to find somebody else to run the empire grill. Why don't you wait and think things over? Passionate decisions are seldom sound. When did you ever feel passion? It's true that I don't have a romantic temperament like some people. Like my mother? Like your husband? We are what we are. What can't be cured must be endured. What can't be cured must be avenged. Isn't that what you mean? Payback is how we endure, dear boy. Having said that, I don't want to give you a false impression. I was very fond of your mother, just as I am of you. You want me to be mayor. Well... How does it feel, Francine? To know your husband shot himself in the head rather than spend one more minute on this earth with you? You've gone and done it now, old buddy. You've surely done it now. Francine Whiting. Was she surprised when her husband returned after 10 years in exile? Many people thought he'd gone mad. What sort of man travels all the way from Mexico to shoot himself in Maine? But maybe what he went was sane. He had long ago stopped blaming god for everything. It was his wife who was responsible. It was she who had made him so angry that afternoon that he had backed out of his garage without looking and run over his infant child. Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! It was his wife who had kept him from the daughter who had needed him so desperately. She who had concocted the story of the hit-and-run driver, then held that lie over him for the rest of his life. Using it to deny him love when at last he'd found it. Grace! Grace! Can it be that in the darkest of waters the sun never penetrates? Or that it penetrates just enough to make that darkness visible? Cindy. How long have you been here? A while. How do you feel? Groggy. It hurts to breathe, also to talk. You have a mild concussion and two cracked ribs. I wanted to say goodbye. You're going away? The truth is I don't do very well here. I never have. Where will you go? Back to Augusta. I kept an apartment there. It's close to my doctors. Also... There's a man. You do know I've had lovers, don't you, Miles? I want you to know because... You always imagine me unhappy. And that hurts my feelings. It never occurs to you that... That I might be happy. That I might want to share my happiness with you. God, I'm so sorry. Is it so terrible for you to know that I'll always love you? That the night we had that one kiss I'll hold in my memory forever. I know you never meant to hurt me. Do you want to hear something terrible? Sure. I sometimes used to fantasize that you'd grow ill and I'd nurse you like I did your mother. Power and control. I guess that makes me my mother's daughter. No. No one's like your mother. My god, my god, what are you doing? She says I have to take her out or flunk. She's just mad 'cause you gave her a fat ass. I didn't give her a fat ass. God gave her a fat ass. Really have to go back to the basics. - I wouldn't change it. - I wouldn't either. 'Course I'm flunking anyway. Tick, are you okay? This really needs... What is he doing here? John. John. John Voss, where have you been? Hey, John, what's in the bag? My god. Everybody, get out! Run! Get out! John, no! This is what I dream. - Where are they now? - Crash cart in two. How many beds available? Mr. Roby, back in bed. Better come with me, Miles, right away. - This man is not going... - Nurse! Help him get dressed. Stay behind the barricade! Is that Candace? John Voss. Bill, where are they? In the art room, it started upstairs. - Sorry, sir, you can't come in here. - No, I'm... tell him. - Let that fella through. - My daughter's in here somewhere. - Just calm down. - Let us through here. Listen to me. Where is this man's daughter? There, she's over there. - Where is she? - Behind the counter, sir. God! My god! Tick? Tick? Tick. - Be angry with her. - Tick! It's me. It's your dad. - Hey, daddy. - Come here. You're gonna be okay. Tick, Tick. It's me. Gotta get out of here. I got her. It's okay, it's all right. Hey, chief, that man is still under arrest. Tend to your own kid, Jimmy. Let's all just tend to our own kids, okay? So we're just gonna let him walk out of here? Daddy, where are you going? I'm just going to talk to the man about getting a job. - No. - See? I'll be right here, okay? - Hi. - Hi. I saw your sign here. My name is Miles Roby and I've worked in the restaurant business over 25 years. No. Are you okay? What happened? - I'm sorry. - It's okay, it's okay. Daddy? - Daddy? - Right here, hon. Right. I'm right here. - That's good. - What do you think? - That's a seven at least, maybe an eight? - An eight. Hey! Hi, daddy. I'm fine, thanks. - Yeah? - Yeah, see you later. Okay. You can go. Your mother almost ready? My mother died, Charlie. Nah, she's just inside getting ready. She's gonna wear that pretty white dress, I bet. She died. She waited for you. And I meant to come. I wanted to. So why didn't you? When you're older, you'll understand. You killed her. No, she died of cancer, you know that. You never came. I hate you. And I you. If it wasn't for you, you mother and I could have run away together like we wanted to. We could've been happy. What happened was your fault, not mine. Okay. Okay, truce. Hello? Janine, it's me. How is she? Two steps forward, one step back most days. She's doing better this week. - Tell her I love her? - I will. - I will, she knows though. - You really think? Of course she does. How's Walt? We split up, you didn't hear? No. I'm sorry, what happened? Temporary is what we're telling people, but I don't know. He just sits all alone in his office reading his aarp magazine. I broke his heart I guess. Anyways, you'd better come home soon or you're gonna miss all the doings. They're renovating the old shirt factory. - Yeah? - There's a brew pub and an L.L. Bean outlet going in they say. Let me guess who's getting rich all over again. Maybe, but somebody said her house was for sale. You never see her around anymore. How's your mom doing? You know Beatrice, you couldn't kill her with a sledgehammer. The loan's been approved by that bank in Portland. Great. And the complaint's been dropped. Everybody's just waiting on you. I need my daughter, Miles. I know you're doing what you think's right, but it's not fair. I won't stay any longer than necessary, Janine, I promise. Try not to look too disappointed when you see me again, okay? I'm gaining back all the weight I lost. Janine, there was never anything wrong with the way you looked. You're gonna be okay? Miles, when you were a kid... Did you ever imagine... What? I don't know... More? I did. Don't feel bad, darling. Nobody ever imagines less. You gotta be shitting me. Dad's here. I'll talk to you soon. - Okay. - Bye. Did you hear? Jimmy Minty's in jail. Got caught with a trunkload of stolen VCRs. My god, what a stupid kid he was. It just breaks your heart. What are you doing here, dad? I thought I'd just come up here and... Check on my granddaughter and visit my son, if that's all right with you. Did I tell you I won the lottery down in Florida? You won the lottery? Not the big one, not six numbers out of six; Five out of six though, pretty good payoff. Help yourself there. 30,000. Dollars? No, paper napkins. Of course dollars, you dummy. You won 30 grand? Almost 32. You personally won 32 grand? Me, father Tom and eight other guys at captain Andy's. You each won 32 grand? No, we each won three. 10 guys chip in on a ticket and you split the winnings. How much you got left? Your brother gave me the bus fare to come up here. - He ain't cheap like you. - No, we're pretty different. You... ever occur to you to wonder why? No. For a man who ran off as much as you did, you're pretty confident. A man knows his own child. Is Tick yours? Yeah, and David is as much mine as you are. And how is my granddaughter? See for yourself. - Hi, grandpa. - Tickaroo. You smell better. Well I... air out down there. You got food in your beard though. I know, so what? You're ready to come home? Can we? Ask your father, not me. Old men don't get to vote. Old men gotta keep their mouth shut and do as they're told like they're stupid. - Shut up, dad. - Did you hear that? Can we visit Candace when we get back? If you think you're ready. She's still in a wheelchair, you know. - I know. - And probably always will be. I know. I'm starting to remember some things. Like... when John pointed the gun at her... - I cut him with a knife. - I know. And Mr. Mayer... - He stepped between us, didn't he? - Yeah. He saved your life. Can we visit him? John? I'll have to talk that one over with your mother. From what I understand, he hasn't spoken a word since... I know. But he might, to me. What would he say? Maybe "I'm sorry." That's what I'm gonna say to him. You see, the thing is... I can't help thinking that the whole thing happened... Because he liked me. And... I mean, I was nice to him... But that's it, just nice. Tick, if he needed more than kindness, that's not your fault. Look, I love you, right? Why? Because I'm supposed to? No, because I can't help it. Because from the time you were about this big, you just stole my heart and you haven't given it back for even a minute. You can train your mind and you can learn from experience, and that's what growing up is. And you can... Take responsibility for your actions. But... You can't make your heart behave. Take it from one who knows. You will love who you love. Don't ever apologize for that. Don't ever feel you have to. Hey, you can go now. You want a donut? Sure, grandpa. Thank you. - You never fixed this? - I don't think it can be. Don't be an idiot, anything can be fixed. So, tell me about this Donny. Well, I've been getting some e-mails... The worst thing about killing yourself is you don't get to see how things turn out. Had he lived to a ripe old age, C.B. Whiting would have been cheered to learn that in one important respect, he wasn't the total failure he imagined. That he did in fact succeed precisely where his forebearers had all failed so dismally. It was C.B. Whiting after all who had ignored repeated warnings that going to war with god over the Knox would one day increase the severity of its floods. That one day the river would rise up and exact its revenge. What possessed Francine Whiting to be in the gazebo that April afternoon when the angry river Rose 25 feet remains a matter of speculation. Timmy! Timmy! She wasn't the only person to drown in the Knox that day. Timmy! But she was the only one to ride the raging, vengeful river all the way to the Atlantic. Had he not despaired that afternoon so long ago, C.B. Whiting would have lived to see salmon return to the Knox river... Along with prosperity of a sort. Almost overnight, the old shirt factory became home to a computer wholesaler and a credit card calling center, and lavish water-view condominiums. He'd have seen properties along the Knox become unaffordable to all but those who came to oversee these franchises, which were too valuable to be entrusted to the comeaux and the daws and the Robideaux and the Callahans... and the Robys.
