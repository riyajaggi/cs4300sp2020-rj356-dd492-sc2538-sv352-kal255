I told you so. Still gonna be a few weeks before that snowpack melts. But I've waited so long. And getting out of this valley might help me find answers on how to get home. I know it stinks, but how about some careless misadventuring

 to take your mind off it? I think there's a creepy lagoon nearby. Ooh! Think we'll find some bloated remains? Here's hoping. And while they're doing that, I'm gonna check out this scary forest. Oh, no, you don't. Not by yourself. But why not? 'Cause you're a pollywog. You're too young to go off on your own. But the other kids did. - Go, go, go, go! - Go, go, go, go! Hyah! Whew! Who knew leeches could run so fast?

 Or had legs? Glad I got to see them, though. Truly a once in a lifetime experience. Oh, shoot. Snail trouble, everyone. Snail trouble. Hmm. Stranded, eh? Well, couldn't have picked a nicer day. Whoa. Dang it. It's too darn muddy for me to squeeze under Bessie to see what's the trouble. Hey, I can fit under Bessie. No, you stay up there where it's safe. Hey, look. There's a bed and breakfast just down the road. Forget it. We ain't spending coppers on lodging when we've got a perfectly fine tent... All right, B&B; it is. But no extras. Hang tight, Bessie. We'll find you a comfy place to rest in a jiffy. Wow. Look at this place. So cozy. Oh, hey there. Welcome to the Dandy Lion B&B.; I'm Teddy. This is my wife, Martha. Please, warm yourselves by the fire. - Oh, well, that sounds nice. - Yes, please. Wow, haven't come across a species like you before. Same to you, dearie. We're horned bullfrogs. Oh, so not from around these parts? Yeah, we traveled here a long time ago and just, you know, fell in love with the area. Isn't that right, sweetie? Oh, we sure did. So. I take it you'll be needing some rooms? Just one, please. We'll all pile in. Oh, no need. We only have a couple of guests tonight, so the inn is mostly empty. We'll make you a deal. Four rooms for the price of one. What do you say? Heck yeah! Score! Thanks. But we only need three. Polly here'll be bunking with me. What? Aw, Hop Pop! - Here's some fresh cookies. - Mmm! And we'll go put your snail in the barn. Thank you. - Hey! Watch it. - Mine! Get your hands off my cookies. Whoo! Happiness, thy name is solitude. Freedom! And check it out. A laundry chute! This is so not fair. I want my own room! Sorry, kiddo. But you're just too young for that. But you can have as many cookies as you want. I don't want your pity cookies. No? Well, then how about a pity early bedtime? But I'm not tired. Yep, but I am. One room, one bedtime. Lights out in five minutes. Hop Pop, look. There's another room connected to this one. - Can I stay in here? - Well... I'll leave the door open. And I'll go straight to bed. Pretty, pretty please? Okay, fine. Whoo! Yeah! Thanks, Hop Pop. You're the best. But this door stays open. And no jumping about. Straight to bed. Absolutely. Now, I'm right here if you need me. Got it. Three, two, one. Finally! Independence. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoo! Yeah! Hyah! Time to snuggle up in my own bed. What's that? Okay, it's a little creepy, but nothing I can't handle... All right, just a bowling ball, a mop, and other assorted items oddly arranged in the corner. You know, I'm not really tired. I should go see what Anne and Sprig are up to. Hey, girlfriend! Huh, not here. Weird. Anne doesn't go anywhere without her phone. Well, let's go see what Sprig is up to. Hey-o! Where's the party at? Huh. Sprig's not here either. It's fine. Totally fine. They're probably just somewhere else. And now to calmly head back to my own room. No, Polly. Resist. You go crawling back to Hop Pop now and you'll never be left on your own again. It'll be fine. You'll be fine. Hop Pop! I don't wanna be on my own. Sprig and Anne are missing and I'm scared. I don't wanna... I've been looking all over for you. Ha! Huh? Huh? All right, time to pick a card. Juliet, I think you went first last time, so, Juniper, you go first. Ooh. Looks like I've got the geezer. Aged to perfection. Juliet? I got the tall one. Talk about your drumsticks. Well, I guess I'll just have to be happy with the boy. Cook time will be much shorter. Delicious. They're cannibals. Ooh. The little one got away. Must not have eaten any of my cookies. Were they not sweet enough? Did I goof the recipe? Oh, dearie me. Oh, come on, Martha. No one makes a slumberdoodle better than you, and you know that. All right, you love birds, that's enough. Yeah, we're hungry. Mmm, delectable. That's my family! Well, let me just go get the marinade ready and... Hyah! Marinate this, you cannibals. - Ah! - Hyah! Rise and shine, fam. Huh? Wha... What's goin' on? Five more minutes. - Hi, Polly. - Hey. We gotta get out of here. Oh, dear. You're in way over your head, sweetie. Yeah, what can a legless little tadpole like you do to stop us? You're right. I am just a little tadpole, and I'm not ready to be alone! My marinade! All right, time to get a move on, fam. Now, just hold on a second... This way. Let's move. Don't you dare leave. Finally. A chance to use everything I know about chemistry. We gotta find Bessie. - Bessie! - Bessie! - Bessie! Oh, thank goodness you're all right, you beautiful, precious princess. Sprig, bring that lantern over here. Polly, get under there and take a look. You got it, chief. A trap. So that's what slowed her down. How the heck did this get on her tail, though? Uh... Hop Pop? This was all a setup. They trap passengers at the inn. We're the "breakfast" in "bed and breakfast." Yeah, obvi. Let's go. What are you laughing about? Nothing. Let's get outta here. Bessie, things are gettin' messy. Ooh, thanks honey. Hey, do you hear that? Did you leave the sink running? Oh, dear. Chemistry wins! Yes! Home sweet home. You know, Polly, even though you're still a tadpole, you certainly proved you can be on your own. Maybe it's time I give you a little more independence. Thanks, Hop Pop. But I was actually hoping to sleep in your room tonight. Being on my own was kinda freaky. I suppose that'd be all right. So. Turns out tonight's events were a tad traumatic. Room for two more? Get in here, you crazy kids. Great grubs, Sprig! Your feet are cold! Deal with it. *AMPHIBIA* Episode : "Wally and Anne" Sync corrections by srjanapala Now remember, green and red, be well fed. Blue and red, instantly dead. Oh, wait. Or was that, "Green and red, instantly dead"? Huh? Bleh. Hmm. Yup, that's a mushroom. Did you guys see that? Purple and green heals the spleen. Hey, guys. Huh? What the heck? Oh! Whoa. No, wait. Come back. You're so cool. There you are. You guys just missed it. What, you barfing up a butterfly? Naw, we totally saw that. No, no, no, no. There was this magical creature made of moss. It was beautiful. Good one, Anne. Saw the ol' "Moss Man," huh? Yeah, that sounds about right. Anne, the Moss Man's a myth. Only crazy people and gullible tadpoles believe in it. Wait. You're telling me you guys have giant fire-breathing beavers and mutant centipedes, but you don't believe in this? Well, yeah, we've seen those. Look, your world might have stuff like flying machines and magic memory boxes. But we don't have weird stuff like that here. This is just a normal town. You're talking frogs! Never mind. I'm done talking about it. I am not done talking about it. Still? I'm tellin' you guys, I saw it, I saw it, I saw it. Careful, Anne. You keep rantin' and ravin', you'll put One-Eyed Wally out of a job. Ha! She totally does sound like Wally. You take that back. I am not a weirdo like Wally. I'm a strong, sane woman who saw the Moss Man. So! You've seen the Moss Man too, eh? I seen it once. Deep in the moors where it makes its home and feeds on mist. Skin of moss, it had. Took me hand clean off, it did. You have both your hands, Wally. Lefty! When did you get back? Stop it. I know it sounds crazy when he says it. But I saw what I saw. Whatever you say... One-Shoed Anne. Huh? Oh, I get it. Like One-Eyed Wally. Sharp as ever, sis. You might as well start learnin' the accordion. And sleepin' under bridges. Wouldn't want to be that guy. Anne, actually, I believe you... Thank you. Jeez. Dreamt it. I believe you dreamt it. She does sounds like Wally. - Rantin' and ravin'. One-Shoed Anne. One-Shoed Anne. Ah! ♪ I lost me true love ♪ ♪ By the old willow tree ♪ Angel of death. You've come for me at last. What? No, Wally, it's me. Anne. So it is. Whoo! Deja vu. You jumped me before? Listen, you said you know where the Moss Man lives. Take me there so I can snap a pic of it, prove I'm normal, and never be associated with you ever again. No offense. Okay. Please. I just got people to stop calling me the town monster. I can't become the town weirdo. I said okay. Oh. Thanks. But the journey will be fraught with peril. - ♪ Oh, the Misty Moors Are dark and gray... ♪ Hope he doesn't play that thing the whole way. Okay, that's enough. Oh, thank goodness. Yes. Or is it? And with his dying words he told me, "Wallace, take this accordion, find my killer and defeat him with the power of song." Anyway, enough about me. Tell me about yourself. Hard pass. That's kind of personal and you're kinda basically an unstable stranger. No! Wally, you saved my phone. Oh, yeah, and my life. Don't mention it, love. I know how much this thing means to you. Oh. Thanks. Now, let's hurry up and get that photo. Hmm. Where's Anne? Clap, pull it back, fist bump, flip it up, lock it in, twist it, twainst it, not against it, spank the baby, where's the baby? There's the baby. Shake hands with the baby. Wow, that was incredible. I'll never shake hands the normal way again. Thanks. My friends used to think my elaborate handshakes were silly. Oh, there's your first mistake, love. I never care what other people think of me. Easy for you to say. Back home, your reputation is everything. - Lucky for you, you're not back home. - Huh? Anne, the way I see it, you've got a great opportunity in front of you. Whole new world, new people, free to be whatever you want. That's... kinda genius, Wally. Yup, yup, yup, yup, yup. Hey, dude, you still awake? Yup, yup, yup, yup, yup. Weirdo. Yup, yup, yup, yup, yup. We've finally made it. The Misty Moors. Time for the Moss Man summoning ritual. Summoning ritual? Uh... Are you sure this is gonna work? Butterflies! Oi! Where are you going? I'm only halfway done. Oh. Whoa. Hmm? - Quick! After it. - Oh, right. Wait! No! Wait. No. Where'd it go? Oh, dang mist! We lost him again. We were so close. I just can't believe it's actually real. I know, right? Wait, what? I thought it was a myth. I mean, it's preposterous. But you... I don't... What? So you took me all the way out here based on a lie? Yeah. I mean, we had fun, though, didn't we? That's not the point. I could've easily gone back with no proof. And then everyone would think I was like you. What's so bad about being like me? Wally... Oh, woof. Wally. I didn't... That's not what I meant. I'm sorry. It's cool you don't care what people think about you. And I'm glad we came out here together. - You mean it? - Totally. Clap it, pull it back, fist bump... - Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh, no. Maybe... - Um... - Yeah? Is that right? - It was... something like that? Yeah? Now let's get a pic of that Moss Man. Together. Oh! Look! Huh? There it goes. We gotta hoof it. Yup, yup, yup, yup, yup. Huh? Good thing I did bouldering club in school. One hand in front of the other, Wally. Oh! My iconic hat. Perfect. Yo, Wally, you almost up here? Yep. And I think I'm really starting to get the hang of this. Wally! Wally! Hold on, I'm coming. No. I'll be fine. Just take the picture! I got you, buddy. Thanks. Did you get the picture? Not yet. Come on. One, two, three. Upsy-daisy. It's gone. The trail's gone too. You lost your one chance to get proof and it's all my fault. Now everyone's gonna think you're as loony as I am. You know what? I'm good with that. Wait, really? What a turnaround. We know what we saw. And a good friend once told me it doesn't matter what other people think of you. That's a good line. Would your friend mind if I used it? It was you, Wally. Yeah, I know. Or was it? You goofball. Wally! So there we were, our bodies ravaged. Hanging on the edge of the cliff, the beastie staring down at us, lickin' its mossy chops. Any proof? Absolutely not. - They're two peas in a pod, these loons. - Eh, tough crowd. - Can't please everyone. Well, best be heading off. ♪ Oh, there once was a lass Named Anne the Fair ♪ ♪ She put up a front And played her part ♪ ♪ But soon enough Touched this loon's heart ♪ Anne! We heard people at Stumpy's saying you're as weird as Wally. You must be pretty upset. Honestly, guys, I don't mind. You don't have to be strong for us. Let it out, girl. No, seriously. I'm fine. Shh. Poor thing. I'm One-Shoed Anne! She's deranged!
