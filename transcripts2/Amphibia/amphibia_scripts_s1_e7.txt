 [humming] [gasps] Stay back. It could be a bloodsucking predator. You are really not selling me on this place. Oh, no. It's an... Ambush! [grunting] - I'm hit! Sprig down! - Sprig down! - Ha ha! - Hey, Ivy. Nice ambush. Gourd in a wig? Classic. [chuckles] Can't take all the credit. You're really easy to trick. - Well, guilty as charged. - [both laugh] Ahem. [clearing throat]

 Oh, IvyAnne, Oddity from another world. And meet Ivy. Childhood acquaintance and occasional sparring partner. [grunts, laughs] - Hey, Ivy. - Hey, I've seen you around. Nice to officially meet. Do you like being randomly attacked? - Not at all. - Well, too bad. See you later, Sprig. But you won't see me. [shouts] [laughs] Well, well, well. She's kinda cute, huh? I don't know what you're talking about. Well, well, well, well, well, well, well. [Sprig] You're being weird, Anne. [Anne] We're home! What have you two been doin'? I've been lookin' for you all morning. Oh, nothing. Except Sprig was totally flirting with a cute girl! [gasps] No kiddin'? Anne, it's not like that. Ivy Sundew and I are just friends. Ivy Sundew? Nobody move! I'm gettin' the courtship kit. This is so exciting! I'm gonna go get my dating magazines. BRB! I don't actually care. Here we go. The Firefly Formal is tonight. It's the perfect opportunity to begin the ritual. - Ritual? - Uh-huh. Only frogs who have performed the ceremonial dance in the ceremonial garb are allowed to be wed. Huh. Kitschy. I like it. Guys! We're just friends. Besides, I'm already engaged to Maddie, right? She gave me this nifty ring. Forget her. The Sundews have secret proprietary crops. Do you have any idea what that means? Uh... If our families merge, we'll be rich! Wow. So romantic. Uhh! I love these magazines. Look, Sprig. It says here two-thirds of all soul mates start out as "just friends." Wait, what? Really? And you trust these things? Definitely. Magazines never lie. Could Ivy be my eternal love, my soul mate, the cat to my bat? Well, we're about to find out 'cause I already asked her family. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. They agreed to a date! What do you want? Oh, your tip. All right, here you go. But don't take too much, though. I have chores to do later. Well, missing out on eternal love does sound bad. I guess one date couldn't hurt. - Hey! - That's my boy! [music playing] - [Hop Pop] Stop strugglin'. - Just a little more. - [Sprig grunting] - All righty. Cool. My boy, you look incredible. Uh... I don't know about this. Ivy's gonna think I look stupid. I think I look stupid. Great! You'll have something in common. It's fine. Ow. Ow. Ow. My little girl's a woman. Mom! [gulps] All right, boy, go get that lucrative business relationship. Oh, I mean, romantic relationship. [chuckles] Saved it. [squeaking] Hey. Hi. Uh... these are for you. Oh. Thanks. So... you're looking like a... girl frog. Oh, okay. I like your, uh, collar. [groans, chuckles] [sighs] I'm so happy we agreed on this merger, Hopadiah. That Sprig of yours looks like a hard worker. Like we agreed, you'll get Sprig to work at your restaurant, and I'll get the seeds to those Sundew vegetables. Agreed. This is so exciting. I wonder what their ship name will be. Ivig? Sprigivy? What are you even saying? Shh! Let's watch our little love doves fly. - Love doves are birds that mate for life. - I got it. Excuse me, everybody, but I hear we have a couple of love doves here tonight. Ivy Sundew and Sprig Plantar. Whoo! A big hand for them. Come on, let me hear it. Hopadiah Plantar says, "Sprig, don't mess this up for us." And Felicia Sundew would like Ivy to "have a great courtship. Wink." It says "wink" here. "Love, Mom." All right, then. Hit it, boys! [music playing] [both chuckle nervously] [both grunting] There we go. I had no idea you felt this way about me, Sprig. Oh, sure. Didn't you know two-thirds of all mates start with souls? Ah! I mean, two-thirds of all souls start with... [sighs] I can't do this. I'm really sorry, Ivy. I... I don't want to date you. Everyone just convinced me this was a good idea. Oh, thank goodness! I only went along because I didn't want to hurt you. Also 'cause my mom forced me. Ha! Parents, am I right? What do you say we ditch this thing and go watch some fireflies? They're in season. [laughs] After you, friend. Why, thank you, friend. [both laughing] Ooh-la-la. The little love doves are sneaking off into the woods. You know what that means. It means, they're abandoning the ritual! If those two don't finish that dance... Then this courtship will be ruined! Along with my financial security! Wait, what? We cannot let them waste this chance. They say nine out of ten people stay up at night regretting missed romantic opportunities. Nine out of ten! Come on, gang. Let's get this merger back on track. Uh, counterpoint. Why don't we just leave them alone? Ridiculous. Not a chance. I'm way too invested right now. [grunting] Wow. Man, this is way better than that stuffy old dance. Right, Ivy? Ivy? Ivy? Ambush! Ha ha! Oh, no, you don't. Ha ha ha! Come back here! This'll be your grave! That's, uh... That's pretty dark. Hmm. Where are those dang kids? - [wings flapping] - [bird screeches] - What's that? - Huh? - They're beautiful. - Just look at them. Love doves. Don't move or we're dead. What? I thought they were all romantic and mate for life. Yeah, and they spend that life massacring all living things. [both coo, shriek] [all scream] - [squawking] - [all scream] - [all] Beautiful. - [all scream] Hey, purple ones. Oh, yeah, those are babies. I read that they're purple so the moms can find them if they get lost. What? That's adorable. I know, right? Bleh. [screaming] What the... That sounded like... [screaming] Our families! We gotta help them! Way ahead of you. Come on, let's go! [screeching] [all grunt] [all gasp] [both shriek] We're stuck. [both squawk] Uh, so they're not gonna eat us? Not right away. Love doves prefer to let their prey marinate in fear first. [groans] Can it, Plantar. This is all your fault. If you taught your grandson proper courtship technique... My fault? It's obviously yours. [grunts, spits] Guys, it says here that our relationships define us, and nothing else. Nothing else! [all speaking, indistinct] [growls] Enough! It's all your faults. Say what? Impossible. Zip it! The only reason we're here marinating is because you all had to play matchmaker. You two were greedy, plain and simple. - Maybe a little. - It's nuanced. Nice. Totally innocent for once. You two should be ashamed. Are you kidding? Sprig only went through with this because of you and this dumb magazine! [growling] [panting] Wow. I feel lighter somehow, more... free. [both] Hey! We're here to rescue you. Whew! Oh, thank frog. We're also here to tell you we don't want to date each other and we never will. We know. Polly set us straight. Look, kids, we... Sprig, I'm so sorry. [shrieking] I always tell them, "Save the heartfelt apologies for when we get to safety." Don't worry, guys. Sprig and I are ready for combat. - Right? - Right. On the count of three. One, two... - Sprig? - Ambush! Ha ha! - [grunts] - [shrieks] Take that, you beautiful creature! [squawks] - [squawks] - Whoa! [cooing] Nice ambush. Well, I learned from the best. Now let's finish this up. [squawks] [sighs] Amazing. Even in defeat, they're majestic. [cooing] Come along now, Ivy. Let's get you home so I can apologize safely. Okay. That was fun. - See ya, Sprig! - See ya, Ivy! Sprig, next time we won't get the courtship kit out until you're good and ready. Now I can focus on finding love for Polly. No! Well, that's the end of that. Now you and Ivy can go back to being just friends. Yep. Oh, you just fell in love with here, didn't you? Yeah, I just fell in love with her. [frogs croaking] *AMPHIBIA* Episode (Part-B): "Anne Vs Wild" Sync corrections by srjanapala [wind whistling] Blech. Hands are feeling pretty dry. That will not do. Lotion, lotion. Did I get zapped here with any lotion? Oh, hey. What's this? Oh, my gosh. Guys! I brought a bath bomb from home and didn't even know it! Oh, yeah! Man, I can't wait to try this baby out. Uh... You guys going somewhere? Yep. The three of us are going to Camp Phlegmington. Gonna rough it outdoors and get filthy! Wait, without me? Sure are. When we Plantars camp, we camp hard. No sense in you coming with us and being miserable. You know you hate dirt, bugs, rocks... and nature. You're soft, Anne, like a baby. Really, you should be glad you're not one of us. That's ridiculous. Me, soft? Pfft! Just because I'm not a Plantar doesn't mean I can't have a good time with you guys. Take me with you. Please, please, please? Are you sure? I wasn't kiddin' when I said "rough." And I wasn't kidding when I said you were soft. Super-sure. Aw, come on, guys. If Anne says she can handle it, she can handle it. Well, all right, kid. Hop on. Whoo, whoo! Psst. Hey, since you're coming with us, we gotta lather you up with this gunk. Only way to keep the ticks away. [chuckles] Here we go. Ahh. And back around. Ooh. Looks like I missed a spot. Totally not regretting this. [grunts] Yeah! Easy does it, easy does it. Ha! Aah! [grunts] Ahh. I can't wait to tell scary stories. The more teen frogs running from deranged psychopaths, the better. [laughs] I'm just happy to get off the farm. So much fresh air, and it's all mine. [inhales deeply] [giggles] I personally love the peace and quiet. A frog can really hear themselves think out here. Did you leave the stove on? The front door unlocked? Will you die alone? Well, that was a mistake. [groans] You sure you want to stay, Anne? You can take Bessie and go home if you need to. Hey, hey, hey! Here's an idea. How about we stop questioning my decisions and get to camping together already? - Who's with me? - Yeah! - Good idea! - Yeah, that sounds good. [screams] Whoa! [screaming] - [both gasp] - Come on, kids, throw some dirt on it! Here's some water! [scratches] [screams] Get it off! No, no, no! [screams] Get it off! Get it off! Whoa! No, no, no! No, no, no! [screams] [thud] Ow! Careful! I'm pretty sure those ticks caused internal damage. So, awkward question, but are you sure you wouldn't be happier back home? Seriously, Anne, no need to torture yourself. Take Bessie and go home. And don't you worry about us, 'cause we'll be just fine without you. [echoing] Without you. No! Look, I know it seems like I'm miserable, okay? But I'm not. It's just... It's just, uh... [laughing] I'm not used to such easy camping. - Easy? - Huh? Look around you. Singing, butterflies, laughter. I guess I'm just used to something a little more... Extreme. Ah! So, this place ain't extreme enough for ya? Uh, dang right it ain't. [laughing] [laughing hysterically] I can take you folks to a real campsite, one where there ain't none of this kiddie stuff, like shelter or potable water. Blech. Well, would a more extreme experience make you happy, Anne? Uh, yeah? If Anne wants hard-core, we go hard-core. Lead the way, Mr., uh... Name's Joe. Soggy Joe. [laughing] Yeesh. Could you like, turn down the creep - just a bit? - No! Oh. [purrs] Aw. [snarls] [snail screams] [groans] We're here. We bunk here for the night. And in the morning, if we're still alive... [all gasp] I'll take you all out for pancakes. Oh, that sounds great. I do like pancakes. Want to hear a tale? - Uh... - I'm good. Hard pass, old man. Oh, me! I love scary stories. [all groan] Gather 'round and hear ye the tale of the Mud Men. Born in the bowels of the bog itself, the mud creatures stalk the inky night, lusting to devour any frogs that might have wandered into their domain. Ten bucks says he doesn't come back up. Just like us! [laughs] Ah, yes. The Mud Men only fear two things. Daylight and being clean. Holy honey thistle! What? What is it, Joe? Nature calls. Be right back. Is this extreme enough? [screams] Uh... um... [laughs] What? No. I am loving this. [Joe groans] Oh, uh, hey Sog Man. Everything okay? [groans] [all scream] Don't worry. Good thing I brought my copper matches. - [groans] - It's the Mud Men! [groaning] They're real! And they're here for our delicious souls! Oh, man, this is all my fault. Everyone, grab a torch! [grunts] Back away! [yells] [all grunting] [groaning] [Mud Men moaning] Really wish we had some sunlight right about now. Or heck, cleaning products. [gasps] I have something even better. Everyone, take cover! Peony Princess bath bomb! Good-bye, dear friend. [grunts, spits] [grunts] [all groan] - Well, guess we're dead. - Uh-huh. [fizzing] [both scream] The jig is up, boys! Quickly, before she throws another one of those things! [all screaming] Man, all I wanted to do today was get muddy and eat people. [all cheer] I can see your butt! Guess we were wrong to doubt you, Anne. You really are used to extreme camping. [sighs] Guys, I have a confession. This extreme camping stuff is nonsense. I was miserable back there. I was just trying to cover it up. So you dragged us to this horror show for no reason? Twisted. I love it. I don't understand. Why lie about it? Why be miserable? I guess I've been feeling kind of left out lately. - I'm not a frog. - [grunts] I'm not a Plantar. Heck, I wasn't even invited on this trip. I really like you guys and wanted to be with you, miserable or not. I don't know if it's the sweet-smelling toxins or the overwhelming emotions, but dang it, I'm a mess. Next time, we'll include you, Anne, even if we know you'll hate it. Thanks, you guys. Aah! [groans] [roars] [all scream] [groans, sighs] Ooh-wee! [laughs] Good thing I wore my axe-proof vest, eh? So, what'd I miss? - Oh, pretty much everything. - Really? Oh, Joe, - there were these crazy cannibals. - Wow. - They tried to eat us. - Oh, serious? Yeah, actually, it turned out they were just frogs. - Oh, no way. - Wimpy little frogs covered in mud. Unbelievable. Uh-huh. And then we ran, we tried to use torches, - it was all a big thing. - Yeah? - It was very dramatic. - Oh? Keep going. Anne saved us with her bath bomb. Yeah, I smell it. It's great. Is that peony? - Yeah, that is peony. - Yeah, I have a nose for these things. So, that's pretty much it. You're all caught up. Oh, great. [crickets chirping] So, you all want to get pancakes early? - Oh, yeah, that sounds great. - Let's do it. [Polly] I've always been more of a waffle girl, myself. Guys, now that we've been through a lot, there's something I'd like to share with you. This is how I got here. - Wow. Shiny. - Oh! It's some kind of crazy music box or something. Have you guys seen anything like it before? - May I? - Sure. I mean, it's busted. Hmm. [sniffs] Hmm. Hmm! Nope. Never seen anything like it. Well, it was worth a shot. Anne, I promise... We're gonna find a way to get you home. Thanks, Sprig. That means a lot to me. [yawns] Well, that's enough excitement for me today. I think I'm gonna turn in. - Good night. - Good night, Hop Pop. [gasps] It's just as I feared. [♪♪]
