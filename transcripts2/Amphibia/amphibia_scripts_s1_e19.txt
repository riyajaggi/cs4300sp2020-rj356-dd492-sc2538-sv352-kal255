Whew! That was close. Ooh, sorry about that, HP. We're trying to teach Polly how to play kickball. Which is challenging for obvious reasons. Dang it, kids! What have I told you

 about roughhousing near the windows? Now, come inside and play a quiet game. Hop Pop's working. Yeah, I can see that. Nice toy boat. It's not a "toy boat," Anne. It's a replica of a famous warship. Potato, tomato. Scram! Tongue tag! If you get tongued, you lose. Wait! No. Kids, cut it out. I said a quiet game. No! No! Oops.

 Why don't you kids ever listen to me? Okay. Everything's fine. We can still fix her. To Loggle's! Okay, I'm going in. Give Bessie some mushroom treats if she acts up. You got it. Loggle! You've gotta help me save her. Is that a 1/80 scale model of The Green Lady? Yeah! And she's damaged! Wait here. I have just the thing. Mm-hmm. Excuse me, sir. Oh. Uh, hello. - Is that your snail out there? - Whoo-hoo! Show 'em what you got, Bessie! - Boo! - Those kids are driving me insane. Unruly kids, is it? Well, allow me to introduce myself. I'm Apothecary Gary. You can also call me Apothe-Gary if you'd like. - Yeah, I'm not doin' that. - Well, suit yourself. Anyway, I've got just the thing for your troubles. Just rub a little of this on their foreheads and your kids'll be behaving in a jiffy. See, it has these special enzymes... Enzymes? Ol' Hopadiah's not fallin' for no scam. Oh, it's not a scam. I guarantee, once you've tried it, you won't be able to live without it. Eh, I don't know. In my experience, this kind of malarkey never... Apothe-Gary? Here we go, Hopadiah. Did you get everything, Hop Pop? Yup. Now all I need is a quiet afternoon to fix this old gal. Well, listen, we'll be on our best behavior. Yeah. The least we can do is give you the time to fix it. We're sorry, Hop Pop. This is yours, by the way. Thanks, kids. For the apology, not the ticket. - Whoo-hoo! - Shotgun! Guess I won't be needin' this stuff after all. Hey, shoo, girl. This ain't a snack. I'll be in my study if anyone needs me. I'm starving. I think there's one more Beetle Bite left in the kitchen. - Oh! - No, they're mine! No! No, no, no! Sorry, HP. Let me get that for you. Don't you touch her! Eh. Probably won't do nothin' anyway. Kids! Breakfast! Dang kids always take so long to wake up. Whoa! Good morning, Hop Pop. Okay. Now, I'm gonna start workin' on my ship. So I want you kids to finish your breakfast quickly, then sit on that couch and not say a... word. Yes, Hop Pop. Don't hate that. There you go, Captain Happy. Hey, kids. Hey, Hop Pop. Um, why don't you kids go outside and play... Yes, Hop Pop. Hooray. Better close these to cut down the glare. Almost done. Still, I shouldn't use any more of that gunk on the kids. Something about it just don't sit right with me. Man, I feel funky. Like I was a prisoner in my own body. I... I have all this anger, and I don't know what to do with it! Well, hey! Wanna shake it off with another game of tongue tag? Heck yeah. Let's play in Hop Pop's room. I like the obstacles. No! Kids! Cut it out. Looking good! Go to bed now, and I'll give you ten coppers each! Well, good night. Sleep tight. I sure like money! I'll just buy myself a little more time, and then never again. Well, that's that. What's that? Kids! What's gotten into you? Huh? Knock, knock. Gary? What the heck are you doing here? I'm here to witness the birth of my new children. - Children? - That's right. That potion I gave you was no ordinary elixir. It was made with a special blend of my very own spores. Your spores? Behold! My true beautiful self. You see, I am a rare species of mushroom able to control the mind of its host. And soon all of Amphibia will be under my command! You'll never get away with this. Silence! Also, eyes up here, buddy. Oh, sorry. It's just, you're glowing, he's got the mouth... I know, right? It's totally weird. I completely get it. Now, where was I? Oh, right. To me, my mushroom children! Simmer down now. Welcome to the family, Hopadiah... Oh, he's gone. We have to hold them off. Kids, snap out of it. Anne, no! Don't let them in. Stay back! Well, I can't just leave her here. I gotta get help. But everyone's infected except... That's it! Shh! No, no, no. Polly, don't! No! Kids, let me go! Little lower, please. Ah, there we go. Enough games. Time for your assimilation. Sorry to disappoint you, you compost-eating fiend, but I've got you right where I want ya. Goodbye, sweet lady. May you find safe harbor in the beyond. Hyah! Bessie! Snack time! Who's Bessie? Is that your wife? Aw, gee! My spores! Take this, you overgrown vegetable. A vegetable? How dare you? Huh? Stop her! She's eating all the mushrooms. Ah! No. Stop. Please! Have mercy, I beg of you. I'm the last of my kind. Destroying me would wipe us off the planet forever. I can live with that. Huh? What the... What a wonderful dream. Hey, where am I? Why am I in the barn? What day is it? Well, not the first time I've woken up in a shed. I gotta go home. My wife's gonna kill me. Hey, buddy. Do you know where I live? Nope. Sorry, Gary. Gary? The name's Lloyd. Ahem. I know. No matter how important my ship was, it didn't give me the right to use mind control on you. - Uh, no. - Ya think? Heck naw. But I guess we're sorry too. Looks like we pushed you pretty far. We'll try to be better about listening to you in the future. Yeah. I guess we're even. Hop Pop, we broke a model ship. You crossed all kinds of ethical and moral lines! Like I said, even. Yeah, whatever. Fine. Now come on. - I'll make y'all some mushroom soup. - All right. - Sounds good. - I see what you did there. *AMPHIBIA* Episode (Part-B): "Anne of th Year" Sync corrections by srjanapala Man, what is with this crowd? Are fruit flies on sale or something? No. Today's the day they announce the Frog of the Year award. Frog of the what? Frog of the hoppin' Year, Anne. Every year, the town gets together and votes on the frog they think best embodies the values of Wartwood. We all voted last week. Don't you remember? Huh. Not at all. Wonder why. Anne, we're gonna go vote for Frog of the Year now. Wanna come? ♪ No, you'll never Make me go ♪ Okay, then. Break it down. All right, folks. It's time! As you all know, the Frog of the Year goes to the most selfless, noble, blah, blah, blah... Let's get on with it. And this year's Frog of the Year award goes to... Well, this can't be right. Anne Boonchuy? Go on, Anne. Get up there! A Plantar, Frog of the Year. I'm so proud. Wow! Thanks, everyone. I don't know what to say. I do. Are you people out of your frog-dang minds? She don't deserve to host a party! Party? What party? Oh, it's one of our oldest traditions. The Frog of the Year has to put on an incredible party for the whole town. Yeah. And that party is supposed to demonstrate the Frog of the Year's selflessness. Anne isn't selfless. Far from it. You don't know me. I'll prove I deserve this by putting on a party so big, it'll blow all your minds. I don't want my mind blown. That's a good thing! Oh, okay. I'm looking forward to seeing this thing go down in flames. Boom! Here are my plans for throwing the best party ever and proving that mayor wrong. Stupid mayor with his stupid dumb face. Anne, don't worry about what the mayor said. Just have fun planning your party. You're Frog of the Year. Right, right, right, right. Okay, guys, listen up. A great party has three ingredients: entertainment, exclusivity, and spectacle. Hop Pop, you're in charge of entertainment. I dub thee Master of Ceremonies. I've been waiting for this day my whole life. Polly, exclusivity. It's your job to decide who gets into the party and who doesn't. I can't wait to abuse this power! And what about me? Sprig, you have the most important job of all: the spectacle. Oh, my frog, oh, my frog, oh, my frog! At the party... You're going to tell Ivy how you feel about her. - Wha... Huh? - Yup. A legendary party needs a legendary spectacle. Can you imagine how excited party-goers will be to see true love blossom before their eyes? I'm not really sure I'm ready for this. Sprig, please! I need your help to make this party amazing. Okay. Whoo-hoo! Come on, everyone. Let's bring the thunder. All right, let's see how things are going. Stumpy, stew's lookin' good. Decorations are up, glassware's looking polished. Loggle, love that statue. Hey! All right, Mr. Emcee, let's hear some jokes. Okay. Have you heard about the snail who went on a diet? He's a shell of his former self! Hmm. Okay, okay. A little soft, but keep working on it. Sprig, my man. Let's see how that romantic proposal is going. So it's gonna go a little something like this, okay? Uh, Ivy, I got, uh, s-something to tell you, uh... Oop! No, no! This needs work too. Polly? That's not what those are for. Says you. What'd I tell you, Toadie? She's gonna be the worst Frog of the Year ever. Ever. No, no, no, no! I told you guys. This party has to be lit. At this rate, it's gonna be lame. Hop Pop, lemme see those jokes. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. You know what? Written jokes are passé. Get up there and do some improv. Improv? I've never done that before. Sprig, work on that proposal. Get some confidence. Come on. Loggle! I'm gonna need you to re-do that statue. Make it cooler. You serious? Stumpy, throw that slop out and replace it with somethin' fancier. Like, I don't know. Sashimi. - What's a sashimi? - It's fresh fish, okay? Get it. Burn these decorations and get new ones. Replace that jug band with a deejay. And where the heck is that chocolate fountain? Uh, Anne, do you think maybe you're taking this a little too seriously? No! Now, hop to it, everyone. We've only got 12 hours left. Hop! Hop! - Oh, I'm so excited. - You said it. You. You. Uh-uh! Not you. Aw! I'm just kidding, Wally. Get in there. Validation! Welcome, my friends, to the best Frog of the Year party ever! Yo, I'm a frog deejay. Is that a chocolate fountain? All right, Stumpy, what do we got here? This is Sashimi. He's a mudskipper. Ooh. And is it, uh, fresh? Well, ya can't get fresher. All right, folks. It's time for some improv. You, sir, where are you from? I'm from the same town as you, buddy. Oh! Great. Whoa. I can do this, I can do this, I can do this. For Anne! Oh, hey, Sprig. I don't know how to dance to this. What? Like this, you guys, like this. Have someone else do your comedy, Anne! I can't go back out there! Hop Pop! This thing's gonna kill us. I know. It's loaded with mercury. This party stinks. Some selfless Frog of the Year I turned out to be. At least the party's "lit" now, Anne. I'm fixing this right now. Come here, you. I knew it. Didn't I say it'd be a disaster? Ooh! Mayor Toadstool, I need your help to save the town. Me? Work with you? Ha! Okay, well, just this once. Great. I'll steer, you grab. Don't tell me what to do. Upsy-daisy! I got ya. Vote for me. We've gotta put this fire out. You ever use a chocolate fountain before? What, are you kidding me? Now! Let 'er rip. Whoo! We did it. Yeah. We did. You were right about me, Mayor. I am selfish. I got so obsessed with proving I deserve this, I ruined everything. I'm no Frog of the Year. Why did anyone even vote for me? Anne, we didn't vote for you because you're flawless. Far from it. We voted for you because of how far you've come. You've grown so much in your time here, and this town just wouldn't be the same without you. Hear, hear. That's why I voted for her. Gosh dang it, I tried to fight it, but I have to say, even I'm a little impressed with how you just saved the town from a raging inferno. Here. This belongs to you. Thanks, Mayor. Yeah, yeah. Don't mention it. Now come on, everyone. Let's try to salvage this party, shall we? All right. Who's a good little mudskipper? Sorry I tried to rush you into confessing your love to Ivy. You do that when you're good and ready. Thanks, Anne. When the moment strikes, I'll know it. Hey, Sprig. There's something I've, uh, been meaning... to ask you. I, uh... Do you, um... Do you think you'd wanna go out with me sometime? Never mind. I'm stupid. This is stupid. - This is stupid. - Ivy, wait. I'd love to. Mlep! Wanna dance? Heck yeah! Ahem! Ms. Frog of the Year? There's someone waiting at the bridge for you. They say they're a friend. A friend? - Anne? - Sasha? Oh, my gosh. I can't believe that it's you. Oh, my gosh. You're here too? I wasn't sure. I woke up all alone. Is Marcy with you? Where have you been? I've missed you so much. I'll fill you in later. For now, I'm just glad I found you. We came as soon as we heard. "We"? Yup. Just me and some friends of mine. Nice to finally meet you, Anne Boonchuy.
