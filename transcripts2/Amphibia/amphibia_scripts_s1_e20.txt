Whatcha eatin'? A puke bun? [cackles] It's not a bun, Maggie. It's khao niew bing, a traditional Thai snack made up of rice and coconut milk. My mom made it for me because it's my birthday.

 Oh, happy birthday. Give me that! Hey! Get your own Thai mom. [Sasha] Hey, Margot. Leave her alone. - Also, nice guitar solo, Vince. - Yeah! Oh, yeah? Or else what? Or else you can forget coming to my awesome house party next week. It'll be really sad when the whole class is enjoying the pool without you. Aw, jeez, Sash. I was just playin'. Here. - Thanks, dude. - No worries. You just gotta speak their language. But never mind that. Happy birthday, girl.

 - [squealing] - Yes! - [school bell rings] - [grunts] Buzzkill. All right, class. Today's your lucky day 'cause it's frog dissection day. - [all groan] - [boy] Gross! Ugh! Frogs are the worst. Right? Let's get outta here. [heaving] Mrs. Virk, the sight of blood... - I... I'm gonna be sick. - Oh, dear. Anne, why don't you take Sasha to the sick room before she desecrates these beautiful frog bodies with her vomit. Thank you. [both giggling] Yo, Sash. Sick room's over here. [sighs] Forget the sick room. Forget school. Let's get out of here and celebrate your birthday in style. Oof, skip school? I don't know, Sash... Anne, this is your 13th birthday. You only get one of these. So let's make it the best birthday in the history of birthdays. Well... all right. I gotta be home by 6:00, though. My parents are throwing a big party and they really want me to be there. Right, right, you got it. Now let's get this thing started! [laughter] Yes! - [game beeping] - [both grunting] Whoo! Top score. [sighs] Phew! [both giggle] - [siren wailing] - Ah! Whoo! Here we go. [Anne screaming] Out of the way, Granny. [Anne] Whoa! [laughing] [Sasha whooping] [slurping] So that's what a unicorn tastes like. Corn syrup. [phone chimes] Huh? Oh, shoot. It's almost 6:00. I gotta go, dude. Family party, right? Lame. Let me guess, a clown? With balloon animals? I know it's not the coolest, but this is important to them. - Mmm-hmm. [gasps] - [phone chimes] Oh, my gosh. Marcy says she found the perfect gift for you downtown. [laughs] A frog music box for the frog lover. I wonder if those gems are real. Come on. Let's keep this party train rollin'. Choo-choo! Sorry, dude. You don't understand. I really gotta go. Oh, I understand, Anne. You're a good little girl who's gotta go home to her mommy and daddy. Come on. Hang out with your friends that love you. Sasha, I'd really like to, but... Anne, this isn't cute anymore. We are meeting up with Marcy right now. End of discussion. I guess it's okay if I'm a little late. [chuckles] Boom! I knew you'd change your mind. [roaring] [grunts] [all screaming] Sasha! The toads! I- gotta go help my fr... Chill out, Anne. They're with me. - Wait, what? - Anne, Anne, Anne, Anne, Anne, Anne! Toads! They're everywhere. We barely slipped out while the guards were... Holy toot, another Anne! Oh. [chuckles] Guys, meet my bestie from back home, Sasha. Hey. Sasha, meet the Plantars. - This is Hop Pop. - Eh. - Sprig. - Hey, hey. - And Polly. - 'Sup. Hey, I'm her bestie too. I guess that makes me your bestie-in-law. [laughs] Does it? [laughs awkwardly] [coughs] Did y'all feel that? [coughs] Walk it off, boy. Yes, hi, nice to meet ya. Now, can someone please tell me why there's a toad army invading Wartwood? You're Hop Pop? Thought you'd be taller. Huh? Relax, we're not invading anything. Come on, Anne. You too, frogs. - We don't want to keep Grime waiting. - Captain Grime? The cruelest toad soldier of all time? Here? Ah, he's not so bad once you get used to him. Now hurry up, nerds. [chuckles] She's persuasive, right? Frogs of Wartwood! We toads have come here to... [stammering] Invite you to a banquet. [toots] The moment we heard that Anne was here, we rushed over to reunite these two friends and hold a celebration. Aw, come here. [all] Aw! Really? Yes. Despite my rough exterior, I really am just an "old softy." [Sasha clears throat] [growls] [crowd gasps] [baby cries] Uh, so, what do you say, Wartwood? You ready to party back at the tower? - [frog croaks] - What does Anne think? Uh... Sasha's been my friend since kindergarten. If she says it's fine, it's fine. Whoo! All aboard the party barge. - [music playing] - [excited chatter] Two parties in one night, whoo-hoo! Psst, Anne, you're with me. [snorts] Wow, cool. Hey, mind if the, uh, Plantars come along? Of course I don't mind. The more the merrier. First class! I call window seat. [laughing] [Polly] No, me! No, me! [Hop Pop] Kids, stop pushing. Ow! [glass breaks] [chuckles] They're fun. [music playing] - [frog 1] Whoo-hoo! - [frog 2] Yeah! This is fun. So, here we are. Ominous. Oh, Percy! - Yes, Commander? - I'm gonna give Anne a quick tour. Escort these frogs to the banquet hall. Hey, I wanna go on the tour too. - [gasps] Me three! - Come on, kids. Give Anne and her friend a chance to catch up. Don't worry. I'll find you guys later. Go have fun in there. [groans] We'll try. You certainly seem close with those three. What happened to, "Ew, frogs are the worst"? They're actually pretty great once you get to know them. [chuckles] I've been living in their basement since I got here. A basement? Yuck. Follow me. I'm gonna show you something crazy. This is where I've been living. Hoopa de boopa! Whoa! Yo, Brunton. [snaps fingers] Oui, Commander? Bring us the usual. Pizza? Tacos? Hamburgers? Whoa, you've got ketchup? It just occurred to me I've been eating bugs for a month. Anything else, Commander? Run the hot water, please. For the shower. Shower? [laughter] [slurps] So, you experiment with other weapons or are you just a spear guy? One more, and one more. One more. Last one. Uh, hey, Hop Pop? Something's not right here. Not right, yeah, sure. Here, Sprig, load up on crab legs. These babies go fast. No, I mean it. Don't the toads seem a little... on edge? Eh, they're a militarized culture, Sprig. I'm not surprised they don't know how to let loose. Ah, forget this. I'm gonna go find Anne. Good idea. She can carry more crab legs. Hey, pal, I'm just gonna go for a walk, - get some fresh air... - No! Sorry. Uh, you frogs aren't allowed to leave this room. We're not allowed to leave? Why's that? Uh... I've said too much. Please just return to the party and remain calm. Remain calm. You got it, buddy. Whew, thanks, kid. Hey, everyone! This is a sham! We're not guests. We're prisoners. Prisoners? What? [crowd screaming] [whimpering] Wow, Sash. This is so surreal. I can't believe you're really here. I know, right? [sighs] And once this is over, we can finally find a way out of this crummy, gross world. [slurping] Once... what's over? Oh, the rebellion. [chuckles] The what now? You don't know about the rebellion? Look, I'll explain. Just promise not to freak out or anything. O... kay. So you've probably already noticed that the toads in this valley have one job: to rule over the frogs. And lately, those frogs have been stepping outta line. It turns out these rebels have been inspired by a certain frog. You might just know him. Stood up to some tax collectors, even ran for mayor against the local toad. [coughs] What? Hop Pop's not a revolutionary. [Sasha] Doesn't matter. Word has traveled like wildfire, and we've got to make an example out of him. So, the toads are just gonna feed him to that thing. Hold her steady, boys! [roaring] - [gasps] - Okay, here's the thing. I struck a deal with Grime. I'd help him capture Hop Pop and crush the rebellion, and Grime and his army will help us find a way home. The whole banquet trick... My idea, obvi. Now we've got those slimy frogs right where we want them. Isn't this great? Uh... I have to, uh... go to the roomrest, uh, the restroom. [laughs] Whoa. Stay. BRB. [bullet ricochets] [slurps] Oh, she's totally freaking out. [crowd yelling] I'm totally freaking out! Calm down, you frogs, calm... [grunting] Knock it off! - They're gonna eat us! - Not on my watch. Take that. And that! Ooh! I wanna riot too! Polly, don't throw that. - Throw this potato instead. - Hyah! [grunts] Let me out. Let me out. [all gasp] [groans] Ouchie! All right, that does it. Enough! Guards, leave us. I'll get these frogs to fall in line. You lot have made a huge mistake. Enjoy your time with Commander Sasha. [gulps] [laughs menacingly] Hey, guys. [all gasp] Anne! Anne! Boy, are we glad to see you. We've got a situation. We're not guests. - Prisoners, - I know. And it's worse than that. They're planning to execute Hop Pop. [all gasp] Say what? But why? Turns out Hop Pop's been inspiring rebellions all across the valley. Blah, blah, it's some political nonsense. Well, it's a good-looking poster, though. I'm gonna die! Don't worry, youngster. We won't let 'em get you. - So what do we do? - Nobody panic. I'm busting us out of here. Somehow. Anyone got any ideas? I do... n't. I don't. [all] Aw, come on! Geez, Loggle. I've got one. What say we plant these boom shrooms around the joint? Blow the place sky high. With us still inside? We're not doing that. Right. We're not doing it. Seriously. No boom shrooms. Loud and clear. Okay. Gotta figure a way out. Hmm. There's only one door, and the toads are outside it. There has to be some other wa... [sniffs] [gasps] That's it! [grunts] The sewer. [sniffs] Oh, yuck, really? Deal with it, lady. It's time to get dirty! Don't touch anything. Oh, help me, Toadie. I got you, sir. [rumbling] [gasps] [all scream] [screeching] Back, back, you filthy vermin. [humming] Just a little gift for our generous hosts. [laughs] [beeping] [gasps] Finally! I think we made it. Ah! Fresh air. Boy, those toads really stink. Did I say stink? I meant, are very handsome. [sighs] Anne, Anne, Anne. Very disappointing. Now let's move. Grime's waiting for us. [snarls] [scoffs] [chuckles] Caught these prisoners trying to escape, Grime. - Dude, are you crazy? Shh. - I'm trying to get us home. Very impressive, Sasha. Always playing Flipwart when everyone else is playing Bog Jump. - Huh? - Wha... Well, see, Flipwart and Bog Jump are games, but Flipwart, of course, is far more complicated and... I'm trying to say you're smart. Oh. [laughs] Thanks, Grime-sy. What can I say? Just how I do. Up top. Ah... Um... - Yes. - [all grumble] Sasha, please! There has to be another way! Oh! There is no other way, creature. Our very way of life is at stake. I don't expect an outsider like you to understand. Seize the traitor, Hopadiah Plantar. - No! Get your hands off me. - Hey! - Kids! - No! - [grunting] - Hey, that's mine. [grunting] Stay back. [grunting] [groans] Do your worst. Oh, if you gonna bring it, then bring it. In retrospect, we really should have tied them up. [Sasha] Enough! Anne, what are you doing? Are you really going to risk your life for these talking frogs? We don't even belong here. Don't you wanna get back home? See your family? - Yeah, but... - Then put your sword down now. End of discussion. There we go. That's my girl. There. Now that wasn't so hard, was it? What the heck? [all gasping] For someone who's Anne's best friend, you sure don't know her very well. She's brave! She's smart! And most of all, she's not gonna be pushed around by a bully like you. [grunts] I think I've had enough of you, squeaky toy. [grunts] - [yells] - [sword clanks] [gasping] [grunting] Anne, what are you doing? Something I should have done a long time ago. - Standing up to you! - [gasps] Thanks for believing in me, Sprig. Spranne against the world. [chuckles] What are you laughing at? Looks like you've got a rebellious seed of your own. You've given me plenty of advice. Now let me give you some. Stamp this out. Make her yield. Fail, and nothing will ever be the same. Not gonna happen. This should be fun. My friends! Instead of a messy free-for-all, I have a splendid idea. How about we settle this the toad-fashioned way? [snaps fingers] Trial by combat! If your champion wins, you all go home, no harm, no foul. But if our champion wins, well... [Venus flytrap roars] [laughs] Baby's hungry. Anne, you don't have to do this. Yes, I do. Begin! [grunting] What's gotten into you, Anne? You were never like this back home. Do you ever stop talking? [grunts] [gasping] Haha! Oh, come on, a dagger? [both grunting] They're just slimy little frogs, Anne. They don't matter! They're not just frogs. They're my friends! [grunts] [gasps] [all] Whoo-hoo! Go, Anne! Go, Anne! It's over, Sash. You're not gonna push me around anymore. So how about it, big guy? We're free, right? Yeah, I don't think so. Whoa! [both] Hop Pop! [yelling] Pretty cool, huh? This ends now. [rumbling] Oh... What? Wally, what did you do? What? I thought we agreed. Wait, could you not tell I was winking? Ah, curse you, one eye! [gasping] [crowd screaming] ["Lean On Me" plays] We gotta get out of here! [Grime] Hold ranks! Where are you going, you cowards? Ah! Eh, I never liked that guy. Move, move, move. [screams] Everyone! Come on, get off the roof quick. [man humming "Lean On Me"] [screaming] Whoa! [whimpers] [gasps] Anne! [screams] Sasha! - [screams] - Gotcha. - ♪ Sometimes ♪ - I've got you, Sash. - ♪ In our lives ♪ - You've gotta be okay... [screams, grunts] - ♪ We all have pain ♪ - [screams] [whimpering] - ♪ We all have sorrow ♪ - I think that's everyone. - [Anne shouts] - [gasps] Anne! - Can't... hold on... much longer. - ♪ But if we are wise ♪ Don't worry. I got you... Oh! - [grunting] - Hold on, kiddo. - [screams] - [Anne grunts] Hey, hey.

[music stops] [wind whooshing] Hyah! [squeals] [screaming] Curse these old legs. [grunting] Hi, Mrs. Croaker. - Mayor Toadstool? - Uh-huh. If y'all die, who'll I embezzle money from? Huh? Shut up and run! [growls] Anne, are you... okay? Oh, yeah. Never felt be... [cries] [Polly] Aw. Whoa, girl. Easy now. All right, everybody, we're home. [all sigh] [groaning] Two parties in one night. Think you could carry me again, sir? [groaning] Never again, Toadie. Never again. I know that was hard for you, Anne. Thank you. You know, for everything. Hop Pop, you three are my family. I'd never let anyone hurt you. So, you guys wanna get breakfast and come up with some kind of plan to get Anne home? It's gonna be dangerous. Perilous even. Understatement. Well, whatever happens next, one thing's for sure. If we're together, I know we'll be all right. [Hop Pop] Hugging a little tight there, Anne. [Anne] No, I'm not.
