 Watering the plants, watering the plants. Branson! No, bad boy. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. They're here! Good evening, Master Marcy. Anne Boonchuy and the Plantars have arrived for your... Sleepover! Sleepover, sleepover! Sleepover. Sleepover. If anyone needs me, I'll be in the kitchen drinking... juice.

 This is gonna be... Awesome! It's the perfect way to spend the night before we hear from the king. I wonder what he learned about the music box. I don't wanna give anything away, but it's gonna be pretty cool. Okay, kids, I'll be back in the morning for our meeting with the king. You enjoy yourselves. I'm off to spend a little much needed me time. And by me time, I mean a full body... Okay, bye, H.P. Later, Hop Pop. Whoo-hoo! Me and Sprig's first sleepover. Better make it a good one. These will be formative memories. Whoa, I just realized, we've never done a sleepover without Sasha. Oh, you're right. You think we can pull it off? Sasha's the sleepover queen, not us. Pfft. Who says there has to be just one queen?

 Everyone. That's sort of how the whole system works, Anne. Marcy, you and I have done tons of sleepovers. We know everything about them. Pajamas, junk food and gossip galore. Pillow fights, movies and tearing up the dance floor. And listen up 'cause this I won't repeat, never ever go to sleep. Sensing some missing context here. Oh, sorry. Sasha always said falling asleep early means total failure. A true sleepover goes till sunrise. Enough setup. Let's get our sleepover on, baby. Whoo-hoo! Let's do it! Whoo-hoo! Kowabunga! Yeah! Excuse me, sire. Yes, peon? Oh, for frog's sake. While I'm glad you kids are having fun... ...let me remind you that some castle rooms are off-limits, namely the basement, which is... - Ha-ha! - Montage is back on, baby. Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. That was awesome. Best sleepover ever. See, told ya we could pull off an awesome sleepover without Sasha. What time is it anyway? 5:00 a.m.? 6:00 a.m.? Uh, only 9:00 p.m.? - What? - That early? But I'm so tired. No, stay awake! Anne, I think it's time. Really? Are you sure they're ready? Is anyone ever really ready, Anne? Ready? Ready for what? The Scare-Dare challenge. Oooh. The rules. One of us comes up with a scary dare, and we all have to do it. But whoever bails first gets their name added to... The Book of Losers. Yeah, and once your name is in the Book of Losers, it'll be there forever. Forever. Well, I'm sold. Let's do this. Okay, all we need is a scary dare. Hmm, hmm, hmm. - Yeah, I got nada. - Huh. I don't remember it being this difficult. That's because Sasha always came up with the best scare dares. Oh, right. All right, what have we got to work with here? Oh, what about the basement? Ow, paper cut. Anne, that place is probably off-limits for a reason. This may not be a smart idea. Come on, Marce. It's what Sasha would do. Well, that is true. I hereby accept this Scare-Dare challenge. We also accept this Scare-Dare challenge! It is done. This Scare-Dare challenge is now... ...official. Whoa. So, who wants to go first? I vote Anne. What? Why? Well, it was your idea. - - Marcy! Oh, no. Why am I going... Okay, that's enough. Whoa, that's a lot of mirrors. So, anyone wanna turn back and go into the Book of Losers? You kidding me? Not me. As if. You know, some cultures believe mirrors can ward off malevolent spirits, or summon them. Ooh. Uh, Marcy, what does this say? My command of Newtopian linguistics is limited, but what it says should be fairly obvious. Keep out. Okay, somebody's gotta wanna go back by now. I ain't going in no Book of Losers. Me n-neither. Guess we'll go a bit further then. Uh-huh. Living my best life right now. What the heck? It's some kind of creepy crypt. Whoa-ho. You mean like with dead bodies? Cool. Anne, we shouldn't be here. This feels all sorts of wrong. Guys, I, uh, think Marcy's right. We should head back upstairs. Oh, I see. So I guess you two are okay with going in... ...the Book of Losers. Pfft. We don't wanna go back 'cause we're scared. This place just isn't our style. Okay, prove it. Take a selfie by that coffin. Ew! Would Sasha do this? Oh, yeah. I have to admit... It is pretty creepy. All right, say desecration. Desecration. Ha! Nailed it. Oh, wait. This photo's kinda jank. What the heck are these things? Hey, they're actually kinda cute. - Sprig, don't touch it! - Look! They're gonna eat our bones. Forget this. We're losers. We lose. I don't get it. Are they aliens? Ghosts? Does it matter? Let's get outta here, Scoob. Roger that. Wait, what did you just call me? Guys, this way! We found another exit! Man, someone really loves mirrors. What the... A garden? But how are these plants growing so well without sunlight? Mar-Mar, we don't have time for this. Come on! Whoa, someone really hated this painting. Aaah! Hurry up! Come on, put your backs into it. My room? Don't question it. Oh, thank goodness that's... - - Holy toot! Take this, you overgrown gummy worm. - Quick! More books. - Way ahead of you. - - This isn't working. Why are the books passing right through them? Maybe they prefer audiobooks. What the... It's physical? But how? The mirrors. Both hallways to the crypt were filled with mirrors. It looks like the refraction of their own light turns these creatures physical, which means... Quick, everyone, grab a mirror. Yah! Hey, was anyone gonna tell me I have leaves in my hair? Not now, Anne. Oh, right, sorry. Yah! So, anyone think they're going to be able to sleep after that terrifying experience? Nope. Nuh-uh. Oh, heck, nah. Welp, we did it. We stayed awake all night. Oh, I still have so many questions. What were those things? What's the deal with the basement? And if those were really ghosts, is there actually an afterlife? I didn't even think about that. Well, one thing's for sure. That sleepover was amazing. It was the best. I just wish I didn't have to add my name to the Book of Losers. Me either. Hand me that pen. You're not the only losers. I was scared outta my mind. Me too. It's not the first time either. - For real? - Have a look. Whoa. Your names are in here a bunch of times. Yep, the only one brave enough to never get in the book was Sasha. We have to find her, Marcy. I need to make things right. We will, Anne. I just know it. Rise and shine, kids. Because of you, I barely slept a wink last night. Ugh, well, whatever. It's go time. Your audience with King Andrias is about to begin. Get ready! Oh, boy. Wonderful to see you all again. Your Majesty. 'Sup, King? So ask me if I found out anything about the box. Did you... Bingo! Ta-da! Take a gander. It's the music box. According to this book, it's a magical artifact that is thousands of years old. Apparently, my ancestors used it to visit entirely different worlds. They were peaceful explorers, scientists, if you will. These three stones are the key to getting it working again. - They need to be recharged. - Recharged? How? The book mentions three different temples, each channeling a different kind of energy. And once the stones are recharged... - We'll have a way home? - Steal my thunder, why don't you? But yes. Boom! Eh, eh? I don't believe it. A real chance to get home. Right? Now let's get out there and conquer these bad boys. Whoo-hoo. Whoa-ho. Let's rein those snails in for a sec. The book only gives the location of one temple. Besides, you still have a lot of preparing to do before you set off. Good point. Gotta get equipped for a mega-quest like this. Armor to buy, maps to study, weapons to forge. - This is gonna take a few days. - Few days, huh? Well, I hate to say it, but we really need to get back to Wartwood. The harvest is coming up and we can't miss it. Okay, Marce, me and the Plantars will head back to Wartwood, and when you're ready we can just meet up. Whoa, whoa, whoa. It doesn't really make sense for you to go back to Wartwood. Say what now? What? The last thing we should do is separate again, now that we're so close to finding our way home. I guess that's true, but, uh, I, uh, need to go to Wartwood to get the music box. Right, H.P.? Technically, yes. Nonsense. Once Hop Pop gets the box back, we'll just send a servant to pick it up. - More efficient that way. - Yeah, but... Anne, right now you have to follow your head, not your heart. The Plantars got you here, to me. It's time to let them get back to their lives. Why don't you guys take the day to say goodbye? You folks want a giant tissue? Seriously, you would not believe the size of these tissues. I'll get you one. Hey, guys, come on. It's not like this is goodbye forever. You know what, gang? Anne's right. The least we can do is have a fun last day together. Now come on, let's pick an activity. There's the opera house, the coliseum, the aquarium. There's an aquarium? That's perfect. Anytime I was feeling gloomy back home, the aquarium would always make me feel better. There's nothing more peaceful than being surrounded by water and sea creatures. Oh, good thinking, Anne. Works for me. Yeah! Let's go have fun and not think about our crippling sadness. Nice one. Ooh. Look at the beaver bugs. They're so cute. What'd I tell you? The perfect place to relax and take our minds off... Oh, hey. Check it out. It's the same kinda eel that attacked you kids when the basement flooded, remember? Kids? Those were good times, weren't they? Yeah, it's too bad that they're over. No! No, Sprig. Fight the sadness. Fight it. Come on, buddy. Come here. It's gonna be fine. Everything's gonna be fine. Okay, River Room is a bust. Let's keep moving. Okay, if we're gonna have a sadness-free day, we need to avoid anything that might trigger our very delicate emotional states. Actually, this is pretty peaceful. - Yeah. - So soothing. - Hey, look, a kraken. - It is. Ha! Anne, it's like the one you tried to cook up at Stumpy's. Who knew fish sauce and fear of death went so well together? Okay, that's enough. Time to change rooms, everybody. Oh, cool. A marine geology exhibit. Nothing to remind us of our adventures in here. Wow, this coral is so neat. Oh, look, that stalk looks exactly like... Hop Pop's cane! - My cane. - Oh, no. That one looks like... - Domino 2. - The cannibal couple from the inn. - Mud Men. - Grubhog. - Zapapedes. - Veggie-robo. Who knew coral came in such variety? Excuse me, folks, but I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. Your misery is scaring the efts. Hoop. No emotion. Sorry, guys. Looks like my grand plan for a sadness-free day at the aquarium is a total bust. Well, If you folks are feeling blue, you could try the Stingray Stage Show. Always cheers me up. Ooh, a stage show? Those are the best. Wait. Did we have any run-ins with stingrays? Anything even slightly resembling a stingray? Nope. Don't think so. Then let's go. Whoo! Show's that way, folks. All right, give it up for our stingrays, Sugar Ray and Billy Ray. And now for the main event, I'll need a volunteer. - Oh, oh, me, me. - You, the pink frog over there! Come on down. What's your name, and where are you from? - Sprig Plantar from Wartwood. - Wartwood represent! Well, Sprig Plantar, all you gotta do is put this fish in your hands and hold it out over the tank. And the stingray will jump out and eat it? Usually, but we have a very special guest today. Everyone put your hands together for Wanda the Water Snake. Well, that's pretty cool... Wait, what's wrong? It looks exactly like the water snake that almost ate me and Sprig. What? When? That was the day you tried to lock us in the house. I knew it. You two always disobeying and causing trouble. That was the day I realized you weren't going to eat us. Now, Wanda will leap up and eat the fish right out of this lucky kiddo's hand. And so long as he doesn't do anything to surprise her, this should be perfectly safe. Oh, no! Sprig's about to... We've gotta get Sprig away from that snake. Oh, you've got nothing to fear from ol' Wanda. The gal's afraid of her own shadow. That's a relief. Close call. Oh, no, no, no. It's the rays you should be worried about. Yeah, they love the taste of frog flesh. Sprig! Hey, buddy, you set 'em up... I'll knock 'em down. Over here, Hop Pop! - Bleh! - Mmm. Whoa! You're up, Polly. Yes, be free. Yeah! And stay out. Oh, man. That was classic. We stung those stingrays. Well, we didn't have a relaxing day at the aquarium. But now we've got another perfectly us-memory to cherish. Have a safe trip back, Plantars. Let us know when you get the music box, and we'll send someone to come get it. Thank you kindly, Marcy. No more tears, y'all. We'll see each other again. Will we, though? When? I don't know, but we're family, and family always finds each other. Spranne against the world! I'm sorry, Anne. This just made the most sense. I know. I know. Logical thing to do. You know, the more I think about it, maybe sending a servant to get the music box isn't such a good idea. We need someone looking after that thing the second Hop Pop gets it back. Someone we trust. I'm sure I can handle the preparations here by myself. I'll just come pick you up on the way to the first... temple. Thanks, Marcy. Now go. Follow your heart. Okay, later. Bye. You go get 'em, girl. See you, Doris. Whoo-hoo-hoo. Oh, so safety doesn't matter now? Wanna try my new gnatchos, Anne? Some other time, Gertie. What in the... Anne? I'm coming with you to Wartwood. Yeah! Glad to have you back, Anne. Hop on up here, sister. Thank frog! I really didn't know how I was gonna make it without you. Now let's go home. Always sad to see someone go, isn't it? I have a proposition for you, Marcy, and I think you'll find it very interesting. OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
