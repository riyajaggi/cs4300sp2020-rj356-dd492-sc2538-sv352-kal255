 Hercules: The Legendary Journeys (1995â€“1999): Season 1, Episode 1 - The Wrong Path - full transcript 
 After a routine brawl aided by Iolaus to prevent a hanging, Hercules returns home and sees his beloved wife and little boys burnt to a crisp by a fire ball while Hera laughs, and swears revenge. After some reminiscing about happier family days sitting by the river, he tells his cruel fate to Iolaus, who expected him to help in the forge, curses the cowardice of his foul father Zeus and tells his friend to stay back. Farmer Lycus from Ister seeks Hercules' help, is turned away and foul-mouths him in the bar, where Iolaus verbally takes him on and yet promises to come help himself against the she-demon who turns the village men into stone and gives their souls to Hera's sister Hekate, as punishment for not sacrificing their first-born sons to the queen of gods. Meanwhile Hercules sets fire to his home and visits his mother Alcmene who was told by Zeus and insists he grieves first, then warns Hera will attack anyone he loves because of Zeus' infidelity. He sets out to destroy Hera's seven temples. On the way to Ister Iolaus does his usual bragging to incredulous Lycus, then they witness village adolescent Orestes being petrified by the demon's tail; he enters her cave hoping to cut it off, but is turned into stone himself. In a mountain temple Hera's guards are no match for Hercules, even while he has his hands full with slave-girl Agina he saves from human sacrifice; he accepts to take her back to Ister, as it has a Hera-temple. Old Thoas greets them, insisting they flee and reports Iolaus' death, so the hero feels guilty. Lycus meets them, planning to run from his doomed home. Hercules enters the cave to revenge his friend, and dodges her tail which however grabs his stake, nearly gets him but finally gets stuck, and misses him to petrify her, which reverts her curse.

 Hello. Get him! I gotcha! Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Huh? Uh-oh. And don't come back! Baby. Did they hurt you? Whoo! Oh, there's nothing like a bit of exercise to get the old blood flowing.

 Speak for yourself. Oh, come on! Don't tell me you didn't enjoy it, Hercules. - I saw that look on your face. - Well, then you'd better remember it, because I'm not gonna wear it again. - Oh, yeah. - Hey, look! All I wanna do now is curl up beside the fire - with Deianeira and the kids. - Hey! You're not gonna be by the fire tomorrow, are you? Oh, don't worry, Iolaus. I... know you need help with your blacksmithing. Good, 'cause, uh..., you know, I'm feelin' kind of stiff here. Are ya? You know..., me too, but... if Deianeira's still up, maybe I'll have her work out some of the kinks. Yeah. Hmm. Kids... Deianeira... No. No. No! Ilea. Aeson! Clonis! No! Damn you, Hera! You'll pay for this till the day I die! This is the history of a time long ago, a time of myth and legend, when the ancient gods were petty and cruel and they plagued mankind with suffering. Only one man dared to challenge their power: Hercules. Hercules possessed a strength the world had never seen, a strength surpassed only by the power of his heart. He journeyed the Earth battling the minions of his wicked stepmother, Hera, the all-powerful queen of the gods. But wherever there was evil, wherever an innocent would suffer, there would be... Hercules! HERCULES: THE LEGENDARY JOURNEYS Dad! Mommy! Mommy! Daddy's home! Hercules, come on! There's no time for dozing! We got work to do! They're gone, Iolaus. And there's no bringing them back. What? What are you talkin' about? Deianeira..., the kids. Hera killed them. Oh, no. What happened? Fireball. Hera sent a fireball. There's nothing left of my family except the scorched earth they were sleeping on. Nothing. But... Zeus? Zeus... Zeus betrayed me. He's your father, he should've done something! Well, he didn't! Now he won't even show his face to explain why! Revenge is all that's left, Hercules. We wage a war against Hera, you and me. We'll turn everything she ever touched into rubble. That's for me to do, no one else. I've always helped you before. Why not now? It's not your fight, Iolaus. Go home. I can't just walk away from you. You can if I ask you to. And that's what I'm doing. Please, just go. You're my friend. And you're mine. The best one I've ever had. That's why I'm askin' you to understand. All right. But if you ever need me... Stay well, Iolaus. Go away. But I've travelled all the way from Ister seeking help. - People are dying there. - Well, people are dying here too! I know nothing about that. It's not your business. Maybe I'm in the wrong place. I'm looking for Hercules. I'm Hercules! But I still can't help everybody whose path I cross. Then you're not the Hercules I've heard so many stories about. Not anymore. How can you call this Hercules a hero? He's too busy ravaging his own home to help anybody. He must be crazy. You people think it doesn't matter 'cause the blood of Zeus runs in his veins. Hey! Why don't you pipe down till you know what you're talking about? I know what I saw with my own eyes, that's all I'm saying. You didn't look into his heart. If ya did..., you'd've seen it was broken. You don't make any more sense than Hercules did. He lost his family. You understand that? They were swept away in a fireball sent down by his stepmother. The goddess Hera? She's a murdering bitch. And his father's no better. Zeus turned his back on his own blood. Where's your respect for the gods? In a pig trough, where it belongs. Hercules deserves our respect now..., and our sympathy. Well, I shouldn't have brought him my problems. Yes..., you should have. If things were normal, he'd have helped you. I don't know who to turn to now. Are things really that bad? Worse than anybody in my village ever thought possible. Then I'll help you. - You? - Right. They call me... Iolaus. And you are? Lykus..., of Ister. Good to know you..., Lykus of Ister. So, tell me what the trouble is. A she-demon. She turns the men of my village into stone, and then steals their souls and gives them to Hecate in the underworld. Hera's sister. Why does she want their souls? To satisfy Hera..., who hates us for refusing to sacrifice our first-born sons. I'll take care of your she-demon for you. Ready to go? Thought you'd changed your mind. Not my style. What gave you that idea, anyway? Well, you weren't here when you said you'd be. I... thought you might have been scared off. Hmm. Scared? Me? It's just, uh... Well, I didn't wanna seem predictable. It's the way I operate. Come on. Hercules? Mother. How did you know? Zeus told me. He doesn't have the courage to talk to me, huh? My own father. No, Hercules, not now. There's plenty of time for anger. But your grief has to come first. That doesn't make sense. In Hera's mind, it does. And she will do the same to your friends that she did to your family. Anything to destroy your happiness on Earth, anything to curse you with a lifetime of loneliness. - Are you safe? - Don't worry about me. But... you're my family too. Hera hates the fact that Zeus loved you. It was a love that lasted only a little while. Yeah. He lets everyone down sooner or later. But no one as badly as you. I wanna know why. It was a woman. You mean, his lust counted for more - than my wife and children. - He's so ashamed, Hercules. For the first time in his life, he wishes he was mortal so he could crawl off somewhere and die. As far as I'm concerned, he is dead. From now on, I'm on my own. No, you're not. You have my love too. I know I do. And you have mine. Where are you going? To pay Hera back the best way I can..., by destroying her seven temples. That won't bring your family back. You'll only put yourself in danger. Nothing will happen to me, Mother. I'm the son of a god..., remember? Hercules! Hercules?! Come back! Hercules. Please accept our offering, Hera. - Hey! You can't... - Don't! But he can't just trample through our shrine like that. That was Hercules. - Are you sure? - Absolutely. I saw him drop a giant like a bad habit, you know? In the same fierce mood as today, I'm betting. Eh, no. No, he was... much happier then. Don't doubt me, Lykus. I've fried bigger fish than your she-demon. You know..., when Hercules and I were... battling the titans..., we were up against bearded behemoths, eighty feet tall. No, ten..., even twelve. We still managed to beat back two waves of those ugly brutes. I tell ya..., my head was echoing with the clang of swords for weeks after that. Oh, yeah. I thought Hercules always fought his battles by himself. Yeah, well, not when I'm around, he doesn't. We're a team, Hercules and me. Not what the stories say. Stories? What stories? Oh, the one the scribes tell. Now, why would you go paying any attention to them... when all they're doing is passing along hearsay? No, you go to the source, Lykus. You go ask that Hydra if it was just Hercules out there, cutting off its heads, huh? I got my licks in too, you better believe I did. Uh-oh. Trouble. Oh, can't you just push it out of the way? Yeah..., no problem. Hercules wouldn't break a sweat with something like this. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. He'd, uh..., save all his energy for the... She-Demon. You comin' or not? Oh, yeah. Right away. You can't stop me, Hera. You know..., this is really beautiful country. You can go back to enjoying it just a soon... - Young love... - Orestes! What? You got something against romance? It's the She-Demon! Orestes! Are those for me? Hmm. How beautiful. Hmm. Don't be shy. She's gone. Orestes. Halt! That's no way to say "hello". No offerings today, pilgrim. They're showing a thief the truth and the light. The truth and the light. Hmm. But Hera's the daughter of darkness. Blasphemer! What is your name?! Hercules. Forget about Hera. This place is comin' down. Kill him! Hey! Hurry. Ooh! Funny..., he didn't look that easy. Don't go anywhere. Hey! I'm feelin' better, already. - Sorry. - Ah. Couldn't help myself. Hurry! Do you know what you're doing?! Not at the moment. Now what?! Relax... and enjoy the ride. Hey! Hey! Duck! Thanks. Hey! No! I'm getting sick! Wonderful. Oh. Oh! Are you crazy?! Yeah. So, you still in one piece? Yeah. Thanks. Here. Hey, so..., what was that all about in there? 'Cause saving me definitely wasn't the first thing on your mind. It's personal. Those bug-eyed loons you just beat up? Caught me stealing food. Well, an escaped slave's gotta eat, doesn't she? You're free now. I don't believe in slavery. What, just like that? I'm free? Just like that. Well, hey! Who are you, anyway? I'm Hercules. You're Hercules?! You know, I'm sick and tired of people asking me that. No, I-I believe you. You're Hercules. I'm Aegina. Well, maybe we'll meet again, Aegina. Hey, what's your rush?! Hera has six more temples. And I'm going to destroy all of 'em. What, and leave me out here all by myself? You know, choosing mayhem over chivalry won't do much for your reputation. Well, my reputation is the last thing I'm worrying about right now. Okay, look. I'm not asking you to take me around the world. I just want you to get me back to Ister. It's where I'm from, and... it's really great, you-you know, even if I was a slave. Ister... Hera has a temple east of there. Well, then I'm on your way. I can even show you a shortcut. Well, I'm not a spy for Hera, if that's what you're thinking. Well, in that case, you'll... probably make it back to Ister. What, with you? - With me. - Great! Come on. No. Oh. This is what they got for not sacrificing their firstborn sons? Someone should turn Hera to stone. Those are their loved ones, poor souls. I wanna know where this damn creature lives. Over there. She-Demon's cave. It can't be. So, uh..., what's your plan? I haven't got one yet..., but I'm working on it. You're not gonna run, are ya? That is the second time you've mentioned that. It never crossed my mind. Hey, you're goin' about this all wrong. I just hope you know that. Just because I had a weak moment and told you about my wife and kids, doesn't mean you get to judge me. I'm not judging you. I just think you should do something to honor their memory, that's all. They'd want me to do exactly what I'm doing. Now, be careful. I know what I'm... This should take the swelling down. Ah, it feels good. But you don't have to fuss over me. I'm not fussing over you. All right, I just want you to be... just ready to cover some ground tomorrow. Ah..., you're gonna be eating my dust again. That's fine..., as long as I don't have to carry you. I really was right, you know? About what? About how you should forget that witch you have for a step-mother? About how no amount of revenge will ever bring your family back? Nothing is. That's the trouble. I'm sorry. I mean, I don't think I've said that. You really do have my sympathy. But you can't let it turn you into something you're not. That's who you are, people call for help - and you al... - ...and I always go, I know. Yes. I can't stand to see the gods play with people's lives, you know? Anybody's lives. I know that..., and I love that about you. You're Hercules, don't try to change that, not for me, not for the kids. You'd only be lying to yourself. Who is the mighty Hercules going to help next? You've got to help us. There's a monster... Hercules! We need you! I think you already know. I'm gonna do what my wife and kids would want me to do. Help people. Well, you're already helping me, if you're lookin' for a place to start. Yeah, but... you're not the only person from Ister who reached out to me. There was a farmer, and I... I turned him down. I can't remember ever doing something like that. But... now that I'm going to Ister, I wonder if... ...he'd still want you to help him? I hope so. He'd be a fool not to. I mean, after all, you're Hercules. Are you sure this is the right time? Maybe she won't see me... till it's too late. Are you crazy? I've resisted many women in my time. It's a special power I have. - What are you gonna do? - Huh. Cut her tail off. But you've gotta get close to her to do that. Watch me. Where'd she go? Looking for me? I hope you're ready to die. Not far now. What's that? I don't know. How's your ankle? I can run if I have to. All right. Let's go see who it is. Turn back, heedless travellers. Ister is no place for the living anymore. Thoas? Is that you? I recognize your voice. Aegina! You're a slave. Not anymore. Then use your freedom to go elsewhere. The She-Demon is turning the men of Ister into stone. That's why I'm here. You'll only join them. No, Thoas, this is Hercules. Oh, you have my sympathy, sir. Well, thank you. I didn't know the news about my wife and children had travelled this far. Your wife and children? I was talking about your friend, the one they call Iolaus. He's dead. It's my fault Iolaus was here. You don't know that. I know what that man on the road said. Iolaus came to help the farmer and that's what I should have been doing. Now, I'm dragging you into this. Go back, Aegina, you don't know what could happen. I'm not leaving you now, Hercules. Pay attention for a moment, would you? The people in my life get killed; that's the price they pay for my friendship and my love. What if I told you I don't want your friendship?! What if I told you I was using you to get myself back here? Would that make you feel better? No, because I know Hera. She's not gonna bother looking into your reasons. In her eyes, if you're with me, you deserve to die. You can't scare me off, all right? Would you get it through your thick head? Look, I'm not Hera's slave, and I'm not yours, either! I do what I wanna do, and right now I'm doing it. You're outta your mind. But... I'm still a lot of fun to be with. Okay. As long as you understand the risks. Hmm. And who the boss is. Oh, yeah, who's that? Me. Really? Hey, wait! Poor guys. Easy, Hercules, it's just me! I'm sorry about your friend, Iolaus. He was a brave man. He shouldn't have been here. Not by himself, anyway. He volunteered; you wouldn't even hear me out. Hey, Hercules had to watch his whole family die in front of his face, ya mutton chop! Was he supposed to forget all that just to help you?! Take it easy, Aegina. Why is a slave-girl talking to me like that? Because she's not a slave anymore. She's free. And that's something you won't be until you're rid of the She-Demon. You're wrong. I am free, free because I've still got enough life in me to walk away from this cursed place. Anybody with any sense would be right beside me. Iolaus didn't die so you could turn tail and run. The She-Demon's killed enough people. Then let me end it for her here right now. How do you know you can? I'm undefeated. This one's for you. Perhaps we should stay where he told us to. Go ahead. I'm gonna stay here in case Hercules needs my help. If Hercules needs help, we're all doomed. Don't hang back in the shadows, Hercules. Step out... where I can see every wonderful inch of you. I know you can see me. Don't you wanna touch me too? I had something else in mind. You're scaring me, Hercules. I don't like being scared. I like... being loved. Don't you like being loved too? Not by somebody with scales on her rear end. Don't go, the fun's just starting. Was that...? Yes. Oh, I hope that doesn't mean that she just took a bite outta Hercules. Come back here! You're going to be my favorite statue. Fortio. He did it! He killed the She-Demon! Orestes. Tellus! Iolaus. Are you all right? Yeah..., I think. It was strange on the other side. Well, you'd still be there if your friend Hercules hadn't shown up. Hercules? Where? Hercules! He-hey! Hercules! What are you doing here?! I heard you were in trouble. Yeah..., I guess I was. I was tryin' to help you. You did, Iolaus. You taught me what a friend really is. I saw them, Hercules. Deianeira and the kids. When I was... Are they okay? Yeah, they're fine. Now that they're free of the evils on Earth..., their only problem is missing you. Yeah. I miss them too. But I don't know a cure for that. Death is the only cure. But they don't want you to die. They know how much good you have left to do. Hold them in your heart... till it's time. I will, Iolaus..., right there with you. Well..., you sound like you're not comin' home. I'm not. If I'm going to accomplish anything in this life, it's... in another direction. Goodbye, my friend. But you don't know what's down that road. That's what I'm gonna find out.
