 Hercules: The Legendary Journeys (1995â€“1999): Season 1, Episode 3 - The Road to Calydon - full transcript 
 On the road, Hercules is startled by terrible lightning; an eerily laughing blind seer says it announces much suffering trough pure evil, the doom of Hera's rage and comes along. In the largely deserted nearest town they find the boy Ixion, hiding for the storm demons, and fellow outcast orphan Jana, unwilling to tell what's wrong, unlike Broteas, leader of the recently arrived group of refugees from the fighting at Telyte; water turning to blood proves the curse is still active. Hercules stops Broteas sacrificing bread the hungry people crave for. In Hera's temple the seer learns the goddess annihilated people in the village after a thief took a golden chalice Hera got from Zeus, who fell for a local girl Hera transformed into a wolf-dog while damning the whole town. Hercules offers to guide everyone trough the Stymfalian swamp to Calydon, a curse-free city under Apollo's divine protection, which means braving a murderous winged monster- the people choose to follow him. From Hera's temple arise skeleton warriors, who track the pilgrims underground; a rock rain drives everyone for shelter into the Minoan caves. The skeletons, emerging to attack the pilgrims back on the road, are no match for Hercules, who smashes them into pieces. Now the seer says Hera has send them after the chalice-thief among them. Broteas convinces others Hera is only after Hercules and catches Jana going trough his things, but proves it's not in his pack and promises to sacrifice Jana in the next Hera-temple, which Hercules forbids. In the swamp, the dog trips Broteas- the chalice falls out of his robes; Hercules simultaneously fights the dragon and saves Ixion and Jana from quicksand, into which he then trows the chalice. The seer follows Hercules, as the pilgrims, arriving in Calydon, face less evil and suffering, and adopts the dog.

 Ah, refuge. Not bad. We're here. It's deserted. Hey, where is everybody? Come on out where we can see you! No one anywhere. What is this place? It's a gift from the gods. That's what it is. Listen up, everybody! This is our reward for travelling so far

 and... suffering so much. This... is our new home. Look. Now wait here... till I check. Huh?! Help! Ixion! Was it something we've done?! Gotcha, didn't it?! Don't sound so happy. Ah, can't help it. Nights like this stir my very soul! This is no ordin'ry storm. This is evil, my friend.

 The coming of doom..., the rage of almighty Hera herself! You sound pretty sure about that. Of course I'm sure. I see everything. And judging from what I see tonight, there's plenty of suffering on the horizon. What did we do? Stay calm! It'll blow over! Ixion, where are you going?! Don't go out there, Ixion! Ixion! Ixion! Ixion! Ixion! This is the history of a time long ago, a time of myth and legend, when the ancient gods were petty and cruel and they plagued mankind with suffering. Only one man dared to challenge their power: Hercules. Hercules possessed a strength the world had never seen, a strength surpassed only by the power of his heart. He journeyed the Earth battling the minions of his wicked stepmother, Hera, the all-powerful queen of the gods. But wherever there was evil, wherever an innocent would suffer, there would be... Hercules! HERCULES: THE LEGENDARY JOURNEYS You got a name, young fella? I didn't think I'd have to tell you. Testing me, eh? All right, have it your own way..., Hercules. How did you know? Toldja, I see everything. Now, perhaps you'll believe me when I tell you we shouldn't be taking this road. Nothing but trouble down there. Then why do you insist on tagging along? Well, personally, I have a taste for trouble. Besides, I thought I might come in useful to you because of my gift. Oh, watch your step. Suppose your gift let you see that coming. No, travelled this way before, tripped over that thing many times myself. You're taller'n I thought. Come on! I promise I'll look out for you. [...] the fire! Look out! There we are! Sum'in bad's gonna happen here. And you're amazing, you know that? Thank you. Ixion! Ixion! Where are you?! Please come out! Ixion! - Ixion?! - Don't worry, Jana. - I'll help you. - Talos?! You stay away from her! Ixion! Ixion?! What in the world's an Ixion?! - Get away from me! - Hey, hey! Take it easy, kid! I'm not tryin' to hurt you. - You're not? - No, of course not. I was just tryin' to help that lady over there. Ixion, are you all right?! I can take care of myself, Jana. What were you doing in there? Hiding... from the storm demons. It's all right. It's all right, he's not a demon. I don't think. Thank you for finding him. Wait, wait. Tell me... Tell me what happened? You better hear it from somebody else. Strangers. I just wanna know if there's something I can do for the people here, that's all. I better go see what's on their minds. Look..., I'm not the one in charge. Maybe... I can help you. The name is Broteas. The storm isn't gonna beat us, if that's what you're thinking. - I admire your courage. - Hmm. We've been through worse. I think you're still going through it. - We're stubborn. - Huh! And what would you know about it, old man? This town's cursed, is what I know. Nonsense. I might agree with you if it wasn't for this brilliance I have for knowing the truth. And the truth is..., there's a pox on this place. A-A scurrilous malediction! You'll have to excuse him. He gets carried away sometimes. Fat lot you know. Are you his keeper? Me?! No, no. He can take care of himself. Then who are you? I'm Hercules. Hercules?! - Hercules? - He's Hercules? When the fighting came to Telyte, there was no time for our homes or crops. It was leave or die. So you've been wandering ever since. Not wandering. Looking for a home. What are we supposed to do, Hercules? I'll think of something. But in the meantime..., you should eat. I... don't have much, but... it should hold you over until tomorrow. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Food? There's someone who needs it more than you. Doom..., gloom... and despair. I like it. I guess you like it too. A gift for you... from Zeus. Oh, great goddess Hera! We, your humble servants, have gathered here to make you this sacrifice in your name! Hear us! Accept this meager offering! Please reward those among us that have suffered so long... with your mercy! We, your servants, don't have much to offer you, but we...! I gave your people that food to eat, not waste. An offering to Hera will bring us much more good fate than will full stomachs. Hera doesn't care about anybody except herself. You're a fool if you believe that. Now let me carry out their wishes! Is this what you want?! See good food burned while you starve?! That's what I thought. Now go ahead and eat it this time. Feed your stomach, not Hera's fire. Jana! Food! Looks more like trouble to me. No, no, it's okay! - Hercules stopped the sacrifice. - He did? - Well, what about Broteas? - Broteas? He couldn't do anything! Don't say that. He brought us here. It's nice to know you're still on my side. You'll have to excuse Ixion. His mouth runs away with him sometimes. He's young and excitable; I used to be the same way. You were never like me! Ho-ho! That's the fighting spirit that'll get us through many troubles to come. - Do you believe me? - Yeah, always. Good. That's all I needed to be sure of. Uh, do you want your bread back? Oh. No, it's, uh..., it's better that you have it. You're wasting your time. Oh yeah, how could I forget? The town's cursed. Ah, but it used to be full 'a life! Full of people! Including a beautiful maiden who caught your father's eye. Zeus fell for a maiden?! Well, there's a big surprise. Yeah. He gave her a chalice. Ah... Forged by Hephaestus himself! Solid gold! Beautiful gift. Problem was..., Hera found out. Did she kill the girl? Better. She turned her into a dog! And then she condemned the whole town..., every centimeter of it. And no good has ever come to anyone who has ever lived here. That step-mother of yours..., you gotta love her style! A curse? Huh. You expect me to believe that? Think back to the storm. Think back to the condition this town was in when you got here. You're starting to sound like that crazy old man. Well, that crazy old man is right. Hera has damned this place, and you've only had a taste of the evil she can do. Now get everyone packing and get them out of here. You're the one who oughtta get outta here. I am trying... to help you. We don't need you help! We found a home, and it's here! Maybe Hera'll turn you all into dogs! - Serve ya right, ya idiots. - You're outta your mind. No. Listen to him. He's predicting your future. Look around. We're on our last legs. Where d'ya expect us to go? Calydon. - Calydon?! - Calydon? - I've never even heard of it. - It's a charmed city. It's protected by Apollo; there are no curses there. Yeah. Probably not a city, either. Where's this place supposed to be? Just beyond the Stymphalian Swamp. Haven't you heard of the winged monster that lives there? It makes sure no one gets through that swamp alive. My kind of place. I'll lead you through the swamp. No. You and the old man go by yourselves. It's too dangerous for my people; they are not interested. Isn't that their decision? Hmm. Fine. All those who want to go to Calydon..., take your place next to Hercules. Those that wanna stay and make their home here..., stand beside me. I say we cast our lot with Hercules. - Let's join together. - Yes. - Come go with us. - All of us. - Let's trust Hercules. - Try Hercules. All together [...] Come, everyone, behind Hercules. He can lead us. So, Broteas..., coming with us or not? Uh-oh. What now? Just a little trouble, is all. We're leaving trouble behind. You can't be seeing more already. It's a gift. Why is it always trouble? Don't you ever see anything that's good? I'm just telling you what's gonna happen. Something bad. Ha... Downright rotten. Hercules... Decided to come along after all, huh? Don't do these people wrong, Hercules. I'll be watching you. Yeah, I bet you will, Broteas. What's wrong? Nothing's wrong, that's the problem. Hmm. What about all the gloom and doom you were predicting earlier? Ah, wishful thinking. I see a clear path and sunny skies from now on. - That just kills you, doesn't it? - Ouch. Losing your touch. Get the water skins! Rocks! Hercules, they're rocks! In the cave! The curse can't follow us, can it, Hercules? Only as far as the gates of Calydon. You'll be safe once we're inside. You better be right about that. - End of the line! - Trash! It's not for me, it's for Ixion. Well, he's as bad as you are. Choke on your water. Not thirsty? We can drink later. Those hags won't let us drink from that spring. Then drink from this one. The line starts behind Jana and Ixion. He just wants what they all want. I don't think so, Broteas. What the...? Wh...?! - Wh...? - Pilgrims! Yeah, I-I-I saw 'em. - Ah, yes, I saw 'em! - How long? A-An hour. But maybe two. Uh... N-Near the Minoan caves. I-I-I-It's not far. I-It's not far... It's cooler here. More gloom and doom! You know, enough, already. You know, half the day, you've predicted two earthquakes, a lion attack... an outbreak of Allurian fever, and you've got three people convinced they're pregnant. Well, four. That redheaded woman... over there... Two of them are men. The only thing you didn't see was that rock storm. Huh, nobody's perfect. I don't want to see this crowd beat you to a pulp, that's all. Ha. Y... You really worried about me? No. If anyone's gonna beat you to a pulp, I want it to be me. What's that?! - The road is trembling! - No! I told you so! Told you so! You should 'a listened to me, but you didn't! You should 'a known better! No! Hmm. Ugly? Dress funny? Smell bad? You must work for Hera. Here, take it; don't hurt him! This isn't over! Hera won't stop until she has what's hers! What's hers? What is it? What?! They vanished! Where'd they go?! Probably to Calydon. Nobody's keeping you here, Broteas. All right. - I want to know everything. - Oh, what's the matter? Don't you like surprises? Oh... Okay. Okay! Okay. R-Remember the chalice? It was stolen from the temple the night of the storm. - Why didn't you tell me that?! - Huh? Because he's a fool! And so are you for trusting him. The mighty Hercules. Huh? You could've gotten us all killed by those bandits! They were more than bandits. Hera sent them. Yeah..., for the stolen chalice. There are no thieves here. Oh, yes there are, yes there are. Okay, which one of you was it?! You can tell me! Huh?! Who got greedy and brought Hera's curse with him?! Well, don't look at me, I didn't take it. Prove it. Olyean was a prisoner in the Azanean salt mines. It wasn't for stealing, it was for killing! - Hey! - That's enough! Stop it! You're letting these outsiders tear us apart! Look..., what are you tryin' to do?! These are good people! That's why I'm trying to keep them alive. Huh, good luck. Your chances of living don't get any better by standing here. Yeah. It's about time you made sense. Come on, let's get outta here! Let's get as far away as we can before dark! Right. You and I are gonna talk later. Did you root out the thief yet? You should know that. - You're the seer. - Ah. That bad, huh? Yeah. I've got this feeling it's Broteas. I thought I was the one who operated on feelings. Then operate. You mean it? You're ready to concede to my... predictatory powers? - That's what I'm here for. - Ah. Hm-mmm. Ah. Ah... Hm-mmm. Yeah. It's definitely Broteas. Or... it could be Olyean. Then... there's always... Ephedon, and... That fellow, Talos, is decidedly shifty. Ah... Rib for you? I say it's time to get rid of our problem. But we need Hercules to lead us through the swamp; - we can't make it on our own. - Oh..., he'll lead us in. But will he lead us out? Well, how else do we get to Calydon and lose this curse? Maybe the curse isn't ours. Maybe it's his. Look, the storm hit just before Hercules arrived. Then the food went bad, rocks falling from the sky. And then the attack today. Yeah, and everyone knows how much Hera hates him. What do we do? Whose side are you on? His... or mine? Yours. - Yours. - Yours. Then I'll let you know when the time comes. Now go, before he gets suspicious. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt. I was just leaving. Oh, you don't have to... rush off on my account. Are you sure? If the others see us, it might ruin your reputation. I don't put much stock in reputations, yours or mine. You mean, you don't kill ten monsters every day? No. Only one or two..., small ones. Well..., I'm afraid my reputation's true. That's what happens when an orphan grows up in a brothel. It's the only life I ever knew. Didn't stop you from raising your... son right. Oh, Ixion's not my son. He's just... like me. No family, no one to love him, so... I look after him. But sometimes I feel like he's looking after me. A little of both, I'd say. What do you think our chances are? I'm not worried about me, but Ixion deserves to get to Calydon. Oh. He'll make it. You will, too. Even if you don't find the chalice? The chalice is my worry. You get some sleep. By tomorrow, you and Ixion will be in your new home. - Let go 'a me! - What were you doin'?! - Nothing, I wasn't doing anything! - You're a liar! - Get your hands off her! - Get out! - Ixion! Don't! - But he's hurting Jana! No! You let me take care of it. Turn her loose. Let's hear her explain what she was doing going through my things. - I was looking for the chalice. - Did you take it? I'm no thief. Check his bag! How about it, Broteas? I don't have to show you anything. But if it'll prove my point... Satisfied? - I sense trouble. - I told you. When we reach the next shrine to Hera..., we're gonna purify this lying, thieving, little tramp by fire. You're not sacrificing anybody. You don't decide that. As a matter of fact, I do. Any arguments? Good. Now try to get some sleep. You'll need it when we cross the swamp tomorrow. Be careful, everyone. Watch where you walk. The Stymphalian swamps are full of danger. There's sand pits everywhere. Help me! I'm sinking! - You okay? - Yes, thank you. No harm done. Just... watch your step, everybody. - This way. - Careful. What's that noise? What is it? You don't wanna know. Everybody, to the trees! Run! Get in here! Hurry up! Get your hands off! Ixion! You all right? Stay here. Hercules is gonna get us all killed! Then take us to Calydon yourself! Forget Calydon! This bird's a sign from the gods, telling us to stay away! Let's get out of here! It's coming back! Move! Get out of my way! Move! Look! Look! Broteas has the chalice! You don't understand! I did it for all of us! I-I... I thought the chalice would bring us happiness. Here! Over here! Come and get me! Hey! Over here! No! I'm the one you want; over here! Hercules, help! We're in a sinkhole! Hang on! I'll getcha out. Jana, I'm scared. Hold tight; don't let go of me. What? Hercules! Hurry! Here! Grab hold! Hurry! I don't know how long I can hold onto this thing! Broteas has the chalice! He's got the chalice! - You brought the curse down on us. - It was him all along! People died! I didn't know the chalice was cursed! He brought the curse on us! I wanted to sell it. Uh... Make enough money for us to build our own city! You're lying. We'd still be in that ghost town if you had your own way. And you'd be off living like a king. You believe in sacrifice, don't you, Broteas? Now we'll sacrifice you! - Yeah, kill him! - Kill him! [...] No! No sacrifices. But he's a greedy pig! He deserves to die! - Yeah. - No, let him live like an idiot. It's worse than have him dying like a dog. May I? - What are you gonna do?! - You want your chalice, Broteas? Then chase it. Hey! No! I see... wet feet on an endless journey. He deserves it. Greed'll getcha! Greed'll getcha! Come on. Let's go to Calydon. - How's it look? - Exactly the way it should. How does their future look? Exactly the way it should; no more curses. I'll bet that breaks your heart. People are still gonna suffer! I... see a sandstorm approaching Thrace! No! No... It's not sand! It's locusts! This is where life starts all over for you. New people, fresh chances. I'm ready for it. Come on! We'll be the first ones there! Oh. You can, Ixion. You and Jana. This is the end of your journey, but it's not the end of mine. Oh, I wish it was. Ah, I'm afraid I have too many places to go, still. Sober mates are good. Well, I'll try to make them better. You take care of her. I'm counting on you. - I won't let you down. - Hmm. Well..., if you decide to return... Wait. Come, Jana. Let's go to our new home. You should've given Calydon a chance. Oh..., more fun with you. More danger. Thanks for the compliment, I think. You're welcome. Wait. I sense something. Something hairy..., with a tail! A-And-And breath so bad it can wilt flowers! Not another monster. Oh, no. What is it? No-Not another one of those fire-breathing things, ten times worse than the swamp bird! You better have another vision. It's the dog from Parthus. Not the one who was a woman? Here, girl! Here! Here! Here! Here! Come! Come! Come! Come! Come! - You're off the hook, Hercules. - I know. You just got a new travelling companion. How'd you figure that out? Easy. She's cursed. And I'm not. Nobody's perfect. Subtitles: @marlonrock1986 (^^V^^)
