 Chocola. Whenever you're ready. There we are. Did Master arrive at his destination already? The strawberry farm he is going to is quite far away, so I doubt it. Let's hope he gets lots of delicious strawberries! Master's judgement and business skills are put to the test. We're back! We got lots of stuff. We're ready for anything. Meat croquette, pumpkin croquette, and crab cream croquette. Why so many croquettes...?

 The store was really pushing them for some reason. We couldn't resist... Nuts-chan! What are you doing, you clumsy cat?! Give me a break--I slipped and fell! I wonder if they're all right. I hope they're not getting blown away by the wind or something... I guess there's nothing to worry about. They're all together. We are making an emergency stop. Passengers who are standing: please take care. --What is it? --Out here in the middle of nowhere? "Emergency stop--The Tokyo-Nagoya train has made an emergency stop due to strong winds." We are experiencing extremely strong winds, and as a precaution, "Emergency stop--The Tokyo-Nagoya train has made an emergency stop due to strong winds." all trains have been brought to a stop. Operation will resume as soon as the winds calm down.

 {\an8}"Heavy rains, strong winds, and high waves expected across the nation" All regions should be prepared for heavy rains, strong winds, and high waves. Especially in East and North Japan, the rain will peak out by tomorrow morning --and winds are expected to be strong. --Aren't storms kinda exciting? You're too curious. To me, it's just a noisy hinderance to my sunbathing. It's the sense of the extraordinary that's exciting. Going out on a day like this... Is Shigure-chan okay? A "Cat Meeting," was it? To be exact, it's an offline meeting for her online group of cat-lovers. She is running a bit late. She's travelling by car, so she should be okay. I'm next. Come on, Chocola. Okay... This one! Could be a decoy, so this one! Which could be the trap behind the trap, so this one! Oh, no! Your expressions are too easy to read. I win. I lost again... {\an8}"Shigure" "Call incoming" "Block" "Pick up" Yes, yes. Hello, Shigure? I'm sorry, traffic is crazy, I probably won't be able to make it home tonight. Why did it take you this long? We got too excited talking about cats... Right... Well, we'll be fine, so you go ahead and find a hotel or something. I will do that. Please take care of things over there. That said, I don't know if I can make it through the night without my cats... So tonight, we're going to be alone at home. Is Shigure-sama going to be okay? The weather is getting pretty wild. What, "wild"?! All of a sudden, really? There has to be an order to everything... Oh, please be gentle, or not! I'm going to go check on the ocean. Stop that! Hey, wanna get some pizza? Stop that, too! But don't you want to enjoy the cheese? {\an8}"Melty rich cheese" "Extra extra cheese special" The stretchy, soft, rich cheese...? --Um.... --Chocola kind of wants to... --A blackout? --Calm down, everyone! Oh, in the dark?! How indecent! Careful, Cacao! Why can't you see anything? As a cat, doesn't that bother you? Hey, Vanilla, stop scaring us. I thought my heart was going to pop out. What?! Hearts can pop out?! We've run out of things to do. Wanna play word games? How about a riddle contest? Oh... Chocola is bad at riddles... In that case, I have a great story to tell. A story? Sounds fun. What is it like? And so it begins... A long, long time ago, there were two cats. Hey, why am I a character in this? Come on, never mind that. Huh, what is that sound? It seems to be coming from that forest. Surprise, in the forest were cats having a party. --Hmm? --What is going on here? Well, well, it seems we have guests. What are you doing out here in the woods? Don't worry about the little things. Parties are better with more attendees! Have a sip. Okay, just a sip. Oh, this is... I've never had such delicious matatabi juice! I know, right? Please, have another. Thank you. The two joined the others and had the best time of their lives. Not there... What happened here? Where did everyone go off to? One... Two... --Oh, there you are. --Three... Four.... Five... --That deep-fried tofu looks delicious. --Three... Four.... Five... --Six... Seven... --Hmm? Were you one of the cats at the party? --Six... Seven... I knew it... I'm missing one... H-Hey! Please be gentle with me... This is no time for a nap! What's wrong? Everything! A ghastly woman came out of a well... That sounds terrifying. I was so scared! Wow. That was pretty scary and fun. Y-Yes, very exciting... Impressive, Vanilla! Don't flatter me. Did you enjoy it? What was that? Just a little make-up trick. Make-up? More like special effects... Okay, next scary story-- Enough with that! But I have to tell 100 stories to summon the ghosts and ghouls. We don't want any! Oh, lights are back on. Come on, tell a happier story. Then leave it to Chocola! Chocola will tell a happy story! Once upon a time, a pair of sister cats went out on a picnic. Chocola and me, close sisters... I like it. But! They got lost. They couldn't figure out the way home, but... Wow! They found a huge house made of sweets! Delicious! Thank you. The sisters lived happily ever after in the delicious house of sweets. The end. Huh? Th-That's it? Yes, the end! Wasn't that fun? Well, it's not that it's fun or not fun, but... Hmm... If I may, to Chocola's beautiful story, I shall add a fairy-tale sequel... Several days passed as the sisters enjoyed the house made of sweets. --Oh! --I'm home. Welcome home! Ugh, the boss was so annoying. So tired from today. Good work. So would you like to eat first, bathe first, or... ...me first? Hey. That's enough. Huh, why? How is that fairy-tale-like? It was just getting to the juicy part... Fine then, a different story. Once upon a time, there lived a cat who made a living chopping bamboo. Oh, this is astounding. Perhaps there is gold or something in here. From the bamboo came... ...a ghastly woman. What is that?! A cheap one-shot gag. Not satisfied? Then how about... After spending a wonderful time in the Dragon Palace, the cat returned home. But when she opened the treasure casket she received as a gift... ...out came a ghastly woman... --That again! --It's getting boring. Huh... Fine then, I'll show you what storytelling is really like. Like any other day, the lumberjack was hard at work. The axe fell into the fountain. Out came a ghastly woman-- Hey! Stop cutting in and altering my story! That's not where this was going? Of course not! Anyway... From the fountain came a goddess. Is the axe you dropped this golden axe or this silver axe? Both. I see, so it's neither-- What? I dropped both. Um... I dropped both. Wait, um... Both? If you're lying, you're going to be in trouble... Cut the nonsense and just hand them over. If you don't, I'll drain this whole fountain. "Vanilla & Chocola Diary" I'm not going to make you give them up for free. I'll let you read my fantasy diary detailing the intimate activities between Chocola and me. Intimate activities, you say? Oh, pistil to pistil... This is a whole new world... I... I... I'm getting very moist! Thank you for this wonderful experience. You may take both the gold and silver axes. Score. And thus the lumberjack received the gold and-- Wait a second! I'm not a pervert! Huh? Your creative liberties have gone too far! If you say so... I suppose... It should be dreamier and fairy-tail-like! Well, in that case... Once upon a time, a lamp was found on the road. What's this? Did someone drop this? It's very dirty. Yeah. And from the lamp came... A ghastly-- Came a fantastic genie. How may I serve you, Masters? That's quite a creative leap. This master is awesome, too! What's this? I will grant each of you one wish. --Huh? --Really?! --Yay! Chocola wants to eat fish! A very big fish! Understood. Wow, such a huge... ...shark! Why is there a shark in the river? And how can it fly? Please, your next wish. Well, in that case... Um... So... Please, anything you desire. I... ****! --What are you saying?! --Try to at least be a little decent. --What are you saying?! That wasn't me, it's just part of the story... What a bad excuse. Okay, next. Let's keep going. When she woke up, she was in the land of the tiny people. What's this...? Princess, the giant has awakened! Has she come to invade my country? Should we hang her or burn her? Or shall we peel off each of her toenails... Yay! I'm the biggest! The giant's rampage knew no end. The earth shattered beneath her feet, and the demonic fire she breathed... Hey. What kind of story is that? I couldn't let the genie give you a wish. How is that my wish? Don't you want to get bigger? Not like that. That was a pretty good story. How so? Then what about this? Matches... Please buy some matches. The girl tried her best to sell the matches, but nobody would buy from her. I guess I won't be eating tonight either... I know, I'll use these matches to stay warm. That looks very warm... Oh, if I could join their intimate activities... I was so close to getting inside... How warm their cat-skin looks... This story... it's... making... me... moist... Her expression appeared to be very happy. May-chan, do you have a grudge against me or something? Nah, I just thought it was the perfect role for you, so... I don't appreciate being treated like a pervert! Ah... Right! Then leave it to me for the next one. The princess ate the poison apple and fell into a deep sleep. When will the princess wake up? How can she miss her three o'clock tea time? It's not like her. We have to do something to wake her! This is the best way! Tickle, tickle, tickle... No response. It's like she's a corpse. How should we bury her? She's not dead! --Is cremation better? --I said she's not dead! "Fish" That didn't work either. How would it?! That was kind of you. That scribble kind of ruins it. "Fish" That scribble kind of ruins it. Wait, I know! The sleeping princess can be awakened by a kiss from a loved one! A kiss?! Yes, also known as a smooch. A kiss, all of a sudden? I can't... It's for the princess! If that's what it takes... --Huh? --Yes, we have to do it. --Huh? --Yes. I'll give away my first. --Huh...? --Let's do this! W-Well, then I will, too... Please go right on ahead. Huh?! As their lips slowly came closer... Another blackout? That scared me. Chocola totally forgot about the storm! What a bad moment to interrupt. What is that sound...? During this storm...? Is it coming closer...? Hey! Stop with the bad jokes! Was that... The front door...? Oh, it must be Vanilla again. Just when we forget, right? You really can't let you guard down against... I'm right here. Huh... Why are you here? --What do you mean, why? --Oh, did you bring that for Chocola? Thank you, Cacao. Now we're safe. I didn't want to be alone, so I walked home... Hmm? {\an8}"Illustration by TakayaKi" "Please watch again!"
