 Hmm? Huh? Y-Y-You followed Chocola home?! Y-You can't! If you left without telling anyone, your master would worry! Master...? Wait, are you a master-less cat? In that case... You're just like how we were back then... Oh, I didn't notice you came back. Y-Yes! Chocola is home! What are you doing there? Wh-What, you ask? Well, um, catching my breath, of course! What's with all the sweat? Are you feeling unwell?

 N-No! Not at all! This is, uh, because of all the running... I guess you really couldn't wait for the tuna, huh? Exactly! Well, let's eat, then. Vanilla won't be able to wait much longer either. I'll set up, so you go ahead and get changed. Y-Yes! Listen, Chocola will handle this, so follow close. Good. Now's our chance to sneak into the room... Whoa! V-V -Vanilla! What are you doing here?! It was too painful waiting in front of the tuna, so I waited in my room. Right, of course. Nothing wrong with that, nothing out of place! You're acting weird. Is something wrong? Oh, right! Here, take this! {\an8}"Full of umami and body, Broth-In Ponzu" Chocola is capable of errands. Quite impressive. Later, I will reward you with a massage for all the running you did. Your hands are kind of creepy, Vanilla... You can look forward to it. R-Right... Master, the ponzu has arrived, let's eat. Huh? She's not here? Where did she go? What are you doing here? Chocola. Chocola, hurry. You'll be doing the tuna a disservice if you wait any longer. Oh... {\an8}♪ Ponzu, ponzu! ♪ {\an8}♪ Tuna is best with ponzu! ♪ Will she be okay? Hey, Master, where are you going? Huh? The toilet. What?! No! Ow! What's this about? Um, um, the t-toilet is dangerous! G-Ghosts! Ghosts are there-- you'll get scared and soil yourself! Just do your business in a corner somewhere! Stop being silly! I'm not a cat like you! We aren't kittens anymore, we don't just do it in random places. That's just a thing that Cinnamon does when she's too excited. Ah-choo! Is someone talking about me? Hey! I can't hold it in forever! Chocola will clean up for you if you can't! I've had enough of this. No! Huh? How...? Let's eat. This is... bliss... Yes, it's delicious. No wonder Shigure wanted Maple and Cinnamon to bring it over. Not only is the tuna fresh, the harmony with the ponzu is... ...exquisite! Where did she go...? Could she have... ...gotten caught in the toilet when she sat down, and fell through...?! What's wrong, Chocola? Not hungry? H-Hey! What's with Chocola? This must mean I should eat her share of the tuna. How does that compute? Knew it! Hey, are you down there?! Say something if you can hear me! Wh-What should Chocola do...? How can Chocola pull her out of there...? Yes! That thing! Chocola can use it... ...to save her! It must be in the cleaning tools shed in the store... Thank goodness! Chocola was so worried that something terrible happened! Thank goodness! I'm hungry. Oh, r-right, of course. It's dinner time. Apologies for not noticing. Chocola will bring something, so sit tight, okay? Thank you for the food! What is she up to? Here, nibble on this. It's yummy. You like it? Good, good. Are you thirsty? Do you want a drink? Milk. Oh, um... Do you mean... No! No, what? Because that means... Ch-Chocola's... Stare... Who is this? Why is she here? Oh, um, well... U-Uh, how should Chocola say... Um... Cute... Huh? I see. I understand. But we are our master's cats. We shouldn't be doing these things behind his back. You're right... Why didn't you talk to him about this? Well... Don't you remember, Vanilla? It was right after the store opened, and everyone came to help. Finally finished. That was super busy with lots of customers. Looks like this place is gonna be a big success. It could just be the novelty of a store that just opened. Who knows if the popularity would last? Dear brother, why so negative?! No other business has so many cute cats! As a cats' paradise, you should strive to conquer all of Japan-- No, the world! Um, this is just a local confectionary... Chocola will help lots and lots, as the store's main draw! Same here. I envy Chocola and Vanilla. Living here, you can eat Kashou- sama 's cake every day. I want to live here, too. Don't be silly. I have my hands full just having Chocola and Vanilla around. Just taking care of the store is enough work. I can't take care of any more cats. True... He did say he can't have any more cats... If we asked master, and he said no... Master will not say no. Because he is our master. No. That was unexpected. B-B-But why not?! Until we determine for sure that she really is abandoned, we can't just decide to take her in. But... Maybe she just walked out of the house and got lost. Oh... In that case, Chocola has to find where her house is! If she is just lost, Chocola is a kidnapper for keeping her around... What?! Just calm down. For starters, we should ask the expert in these matters. Don't interrupt me! It's not fair, you're hogging the attention! {\an8}Come on, you two, don't fight--just wait your turn... It's my turn now! You can't hold back, you jump right away. Oh, hello, dear brother! How was the tuna? {\an8}What?! {\an8}It's just true. {\an8}Just switch with me-- {\an8}No, I'm still playing-- I understand. I will head over there now. Thanks for coming over. It's okay. As a human, it is my duty to respond 24/7, for any cat-related issue. Uh, right... So the situation is as I described on the phone... I can't allow it. A-Another unexpected turn of events... Abandoning a cat is unthinkable! I can't allow any human to do that! Such villains should be forced to dig a hole and fill it again for about 30 years! What kind of torture is that...? Why are you so quick to determine that she is abandoned? Oh, you are right. You said it is possible that she is just lost. I tried asking her while you were on your way, but I couldn't get a clear answer. When asked, "Who is your master?" {\an8}She does this. Oh... That is troublesome. I understand. First, I will ask around the cat owners' network to see if a kitten has gone missing recently. Thanks. You can count on me. For cats and my dear brother, I will do anything. So for starters... I understand. For the time being, I will take care of her myself. Don't worry. Shigure is the expert in all cat matters. She won't let anything bad happen. You're right, yes. Hey, stop sniffing so much. You're scaring the new kid. Especially since you're so huge and intimidating. But I'm curious. I understand. I have to say, a new cat does pique my interest, too. What, you, too, Cinnamon? Yeah. She reminds me of you, May- chan , when I first met you! Irresistible! H-Hey! That took a sudden weird turn! Calm down. I understand that you all are curious, but do not bother her too much. It is a new environment for her, she could get nervous. Try to leave her alone until she gets comfortable. Shigure, you seem to be leaving her alone the least. Th-This is, uh, a record of her growth... And also, if I upload her photos online, her master might find her. That's gotta be for her own personal photo collection... Yeah... Come on, it's time to take a bath. Maple, you take an especially long time in there, so do try to wrap up quickly. Yes. And go straight to bed after the bath. Staying up too late does terrible things to your fur. Hey, Shigure- sama . Yes? Where is she sleeping tonight? Hmm. Let's see... I guess she will sleep with me until she gets used to the house. What? She's sleeping with Shigure- sama ?! What is it, Nuts? Are you jealous? You might have grown a lot bigger, but you're still a kitten inside, aren't you? Strong words for someone who's still kitten-sized, Azuki! --What?! --What? I'm not that small-- Come on, enough. Let's prepare the bath. Yes. Okay, let's bathe together. We'll wash your body and hair. It will be refreshing. These clothes--they're quite dirty and damaged. I know! I still have the clothes the other cats wore when they were small! You can wear that tomorrow. Okay, let's start with the shampoo. Oh, not used to the shower yet. It's fine. You will get used to it. Look at how sticky your hair is. Let's get you cleaned up! Make sure your tail is clean, too! Good job. You are very patient. Those pajamas are from when I was smaller, but I guess they are too big for you... But still... So cute! Oh, the post-shampoo smell and fluffiness is irresistible! Oh, I lost control... Please wait, I will prepare the bedding. There, all ready. Come here. I see, you are more comfortable there. But just to make sure you don't catch a cold... ...let's get this on you... Oh... She must have been tired, being in a new environment. Well, good night. Has she fallen asleep already? Are you worried? Is she behaving well in the other house? I'm sure she's getting along fine with the others. Yes... Hmm? What's wrong, Vanilla? Chocola, I'll always be with you. Vanilla... Chocola... Too tight. We should sleep now. Yes. Good night, Vanilla. Good night, Chocola. {\pos(976,624)}"Illustration by IshiKei"
