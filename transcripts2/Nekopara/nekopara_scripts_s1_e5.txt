 Thank you! Please come again soon! Boy, Chocola worked hard today, as always! Business was slow today, but not unusually so. Chocola is so hungry! Oh?! What's wrong, Chocola? Cacao? Were you waiting to welcome us back? Thank you, Cacao. Chocola, don't monopolize Cacao.

 This is like back in the day, when we used to wait for Master like this. Want to try again today? Maybe he will pat us on the head. Yes, agreed! Phew, that went long. Great work, Master! Yeah, same for you. Hmm? Master? Cold reception today. Wow, looks delicious! Let's eat! Master, this soy sauce-boiled dried fish is delicious! I see... Master! The rice is cooked so fresh and fluffy--it's absolutely awesome!

 Uh-huh. By the way, Master, Chocola worked super-hard at work today! Yeah... Chocola, eat quietly. Yes... Thanks for the food. What, already?! Master didn't talk at all during dinner. Maybe there's something wrong with the shop that's worrying him? The shop? Could it be...? Chocola, if you know something, be honest about it. Turn yourself in now and your punishment might be lighter. Wh-What?! Well, maybe, just maybe... Chocola did take a tiny taste of the cream during work the other day! When Chocola was carrying lots of plates at once... Chocola fell and broke them... Maybe he found all of it out! Such a bad cat will get this... Grind, grind... Ow, ow, ow! No more! Chocola will never do it again! Well, setting Chocola's evil deeds aside... You're setting them aside?! Master was a bit weird today. What?! You mean his health?! Maybe he ate something bad... No, not like that. When I went into the kitchen today... This isn't working out at all... Really... Maybe the shop isn't doing well financially. There were fewer customers today. What do you mean, "financially"?! First, we will get less food. What?! You mean... We eat like one dried fish a day?! No way! {\an8}No way, no way! No way! Don't worry. There's no need for Cacao to worry. We should solve this for our master. Yes, you're right! We have to save Master! The first step to increasing customers is to raise our recognition. Let's hand out tons of shop cards! Yeah. Oh, right... You don't know what these are, do you, Cacao? These cards has the name of our shop and a map. Customers who see this can flock to our shop. Also, our food would be safe. We are Patisserie La Soleil! We have delicious cakes! Please come visit us. We are La Soleil! We have delicious cakes! Hey, you three. What are you doing so early? Cinnamon, Maple. Good timing! I see, the shop's sales... Can you think of a good way to bring in more customers? Let's see... Seems like it's time for us to step up and help. What?! We're going to step onto a stage?! G-Getting nude in front of a crowd... That's... Oh, Cinnamon... would become moist! Yeah, yeah. As usual, that's not what I said. Five tiramisu to go. Here you are. Okay, ready? Wow, so cute! Thanks, kitties! {\an8}"Hello, everyone! Customers who purchase at least one cake with us will get a photo shoot for free! Please visit us at La Soleil!" What do you think? Cat photo service for people who buy cakes! {\an8}"#Soleil #Cat #Cute" I posted it yesterday and the word seems to have spread so far already! Impressive as usual, May. You're so smart. Wow, so many customers! You're up next, Chocola and Vanilla. Y-Yes! I... I'll do my best... Thank you for waiting. Here are two cake sets. Would that be all for you today? Yes, thank you. Okay, here I go. Chocola, you're too close to the camera. Smile more naturally. Chocola has to up her game, too! Meow! Like this? Yeah! Seems like a lot more orders are coming in today. I'd better work harder! {\an8}"Kinoshita" {\an8}"Nishimura" {\an8}"Yoshikawa" {\an8}"Tamura" {\an8}"Kawada" Oh, I'm sorry. Are you okay? Are you hurt? Oh, a kitty! So cute! Wh-What is it? This taiyaki is from a stall in this park. It's yummy. Here. Do you want the head or the tail? The head? Sure. I'm Chiyo. What's your name? Where is your house? Who is your master? Are you... lost? I see... Well, let me help. Come here, kitty! Hello. Hmm... The police station is the best place to take a lost kitty to, but... Um... it's fine. What to do... Oh, I know! Let's ask a grown-up. Oh, e-excuse me! Th-There's a lost kitty. I'm looking for her house... A kitty? Where? Huh? Wh-What?! Kitty, where did you go? Oh, there! Why would you take off like that? A quick gift for Kashou... This one! Red bean ice cream! {\pos(630,464)}"Red Bean Ice Cream" What are you talking about? Obviously, this one is better! Coconut ice bar! What?! Don't you know how stiff the red bean ice cream is?! Yeah, you're the expert on being a stiff. Wait! Did I just see Cacao? Or not? Huh? What's wrong, kitty? Is this your house? I guess not... Cakes... Is your house a cake shop? I see! So we need to find a cake shop! This one? {\an8}"Kuramae Confectionary Shop" How about here? {\an8}"French Confectionaries COCO CORNER" "10% OFF Cake Specials" "Season's Gifts" "COCO CORNER'S Short Cakes" We can't find your house... Any other hints? Hmm? Dead end... I guess I took a wrong turn. There's supposed to be a way to the big street around here... D-Don't worry... Don't be scared. Let's go... W-Wait! Kitty, you're so fast... No! Kitty! Are you okay? Hurry! Kitty, this way! No way! What should we do...? Wait, kitty! No! Oh... We're safe. Thank you for that, kitty. Is there something you want? I want to repay you. Taiyaki. You must like that a lot! I'll get you one as soon as I find-- {\pos(634,202)}"Famous Taiyaki" Back when I lived in my old house, I lived with a kitty, too. She lived with my grandmother for a long time. We ate taiyaki together. We played together when I was very small. But we had to move because of my dad's work. No! I won't leave her! I ran out of the house, and I got lost. The kitty came to find me. Your grandma and the others are worried. Let's go home, Chiyo. Okay. Are you worried about me? Thank you, kitty. Cacao. Huh? Cacao? Is your name Cacao, kitty? Chiyo. Thank you. You finally spoke! Is this...? Hey, you guys. {\an8}"Cat Lover: Just went to the photo shoot at Soleil! The cats are so cute! #Soleil #Cat #Cute" What is this photo? U-Uhh... That's, um... A small ad campaign of sorts... I see, I understand now. But what I was concerned about isn't the shop's sales. It's this. I couldn't come up with a new cake for the summer season. That's what I've been thinking about. W-We jumped the gun?! A most shameful experience. We are a patisserie. Don't do these things anymore, okay? Yes. But I'm glad you worked so hard for the shop. That did help boost my motivation, and I came up with a new cake. Thanks, Chocola, Vanilla. Master! Master... --Cacao? --Yeah. Did you see her at the shop? We were really busy the whole time. I don't think I saw her. Do you think it really was Cacao back there in the streets? No way. Really? Where did you see her? Down by the apartments, but... Cacao might be lost again! We have to find her. Just wait. Master... Cacao is waiting for us at home, right? Y-Yes, she's supposed to be, but... Cacao? Hmm? Not here. Living room? Maybe. Master! Please don't stop so suddenly... Cacao! You were here the whole time? Were you waiting for us to come back? Thanks. Oh, thank goodness. Chocola, you panic too easily. Ch-Chocola wasn't panicking! If Chocola was panicking, so were you! See you, Cacao- cha n! Cacao, Chocola will entertain you now! More like she will entertain Chocola. {\pos(576,648)}"Illustration by: Kani Biimu" "Please watch again!"
