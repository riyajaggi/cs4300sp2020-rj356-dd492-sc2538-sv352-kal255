 That's a new record, May-chan! What are you doing, Maple? That's very childish. Hey, Nuts, it's normal to start washing from the top of your body. Huh? Starting from the bottom is normal. Thank you for your purchase! The total comes out to 1,520 yen. Thank you! We look forward to seeing you again. --Ugh... --Ouch... Hey, Nuts! Watch where you're going! I couldn't help it-- I didn't see you there, Azuki.

 What?! Who are you calling too tiny to be visible?! I didn't go that far! Another day, another fight... They're always so full of energy! What, you want some?! Fine! Come get some! Jeez, I had a rough day today thanks to Nuts. That wasn't all my fault! No, it was! Stop it, both of you. We're eating. Where did I fail to discipline them? Don't they get tired of doing that every single day? Nuts-chan used to be all over Azuki, calling her "Big Sister" and all that. Azuki can be so childish sometimes.

 Is that really how the eldest cat is supposed to act? What are you doing, Nuts? It's not your turn to do the dishes today. Stop going out of your way. What kind of attitude is that? I'm the one helping here. Huh. You're actually doing a pretty good job. I know right? Yeah! Even I can do at least some... We all knew that was coming. Wait-- Hey! That's my bowl! Oh, I'm sorry... I'll clean up right away... Hey, idiot! Don't touch that! I'll do it! Just stay back! C-Come on! You didn't have to say it like that! What's her issue? These ribbons are all tangled up! This is heavy... Maybe I got too much for one go... Ouch! What are you doing?! N-No, what are you doing?! --Why are you even there? --Azuki and Coconut seem to be more tangled up this time. --You're the one that bumped into me! --Azuki and Coconut seem to be more tangled up this time. --Why would you not move when someone carrying a ton of stuff walks by?! --Tangled up? --Why would you not move when someone carrying a ton of stuff walks by?! --Tangled up means... --Maybe if you weren't carrying so much stuff while being so small, --Tangled up means... --Maybe if you weren't carrying so much stuff while being so small, --...to end up like this! --this wouldn't have happened! --...to end up like this! --No, it's your fault for being inconsiderate! --Oh, clumsy Chocola is so cute as well... --No, it's your fault for being outside my field of vision! --Oh, clumsy Chocola is so cute as well... --No, it's your fault for being outside my field of vision! --Maybe Azuki and Coconut need to just --Enough already! --Maybe Azuki and Coconut need to just go all the way with this for once. That could be a good idea. Azuki, Coconut, if you want to fight, just fight as much as you want. In fact, with full force. But no violence. Huh? You two will go head to head, but in a sportsmanlike manner. And that is how the battle began. {\an8}"Minaduki House Cup" "Team Coconut vs Team Azuki" Here, I declare the start of Minaduki House Cup, the battle between Team Azuki and Team Coconut! White side: Azuki, Cinnamon, Vanilla! Facing off against... Coconut, Maple, Chocola! Sounds like fun! Why us, too? Don't think too deeply about this. Please don't make it hurt... I don't even have to show my true powers! I'll beat you easily! I'm the one that's easily going to take you down and knock you out! And the first game is... this! Twister! The contestants are Coconut from the red team and Azuki from the white team. First, Coconut, right hand to blue! Azuki, right foot to yellow! Next, Coconut, left foot to red! Azuki, left hand to green! You put your hand or foot on where the spinning thing stops. If your body touches anywhere else on the mat, you lose. It's hard to deny Nuts-chan's advantage here... The difference in reach is quite big. What...?! Don't underestimate me, you idiots! I-I can... do this... Stop... It tickles... H-Hey, Azuki. That's not fair... Hey, what's wrong with you?! Who's fault do you think it is?! The next is this match-up! Th-This is... Super high-class cat food, costing at least 1,000 yen per can! Yes! Yes! Chocola will do this! Speed or volume, I'm ready to compete! Me, too! I want to do this, too! Come on! You all just want to eat! Okay, enough. Let's decide by lottery. Yay! We are definitely on the winning side. What, so we're the underdogs? But we're cats. Jeez, that's no fun. Boo. And now, the food-resisting contest starts, now! Oh, this is rough... I wouldn't last ten seconds... Next is, guess what's in the box-- What? This cardboard box fits so well, it's irresistible! They lost to their instincts before the fight even began... Next, spoon relay! If you drop the ping pong ball on the spoon, you lose. Ready... Go, Maple-chan! Burn rubber! Fight on, Cinnamon! Maple! Over here! Over here! Chocola has no idea what they're saying. I get the feeling it's something dumb. Who're you calling dumb?! Oh. Yes! I did it! --Oh. --Both of you are disqualified. From the east, Cinnamon No Sato. From the west, Chocola No Yama. Ready? Ready? Go! Cinnamon's hips are amazing! One bad move, and Chocola will be bounced out of the ring! But Chocola won't give up! The difference in power is clear. It's like Cinnamon's hips are peaches, but Chocola's are plums. Chocola's plums are supple and not to be underestimated! Peaches and plums...? Oh, the peaches and plums are mashing together... Oh no, I'm getting moist! Oh. Chocola No Yama wins! From the east, Vanilla No Umi. From the west, Chiyo Coconut. Do it! Crush her! Gotcha. Coconut has the obvious size advantage... Does Vanilla have a secret plan? Go! Vanilla! Don't let your guard down Coconut! Go! Pardon the interruption. Here is a riddle. A r-riddle? "Palmate" is a word meaning having a shape similar to a hand. What do you call a person shaped like a hip? What?! Come on, what is it? What's the answer? What? A person who looks like a hip? Come on, come on. What is it? Think. While Nuts-chan is wracking her brain, Vanilla is attacking relentlessly. Come on, what is it? Come on. Vanilla is always the scheming one... What's the answer?! I get it! Hip sumo wrestler! The answer is: a hipster. Vanilla No Umi wins! From the east, Azuki Zakari. From the west, Maple Nishiki. Ready, ready. Go! This is a good match. Not bad, Maplez! I'll show her! Azu-nyan is unleashing a blazing fast combo! The movement of her hips... It's like the move invented by former boxing champion Jack Dempsey, the Dempsey Roll! By weaving her body to the sides, her blows are both powerful and rapid! I've got this! Now I will launch an uppercut from this low position and finish this! Maple Nishiki wins! Coco-chan and Azu-nyan lost in really similar ways! The two are really similar. Dammit! Umm... So what were we competing about? It all started as a fight between Azuki and Coconut. How long is this going to continue? There's no end in sight. I understand. The sun is setting soon, too. Let's say the next game will be the last. Huh? Hey, is this... The last battle is a cat tower race. You both start at the same time, and the first cat to reach the end wins. Ready? And so it begins. What do you think, Commentator Maple? Yes. This is another game where Coconut has an apparent advantage due to her size. But Azuki has the dexterity to compensate. This looks easy! We're cats, this doesn't seem to provide a challenge... Commentator Maple?! Could that be...?! Ah, so you have realized... That is not just any wall. It is actually entirely made of scratching post material! Unless you can resist the urge to touch up your claws, you will lose a lot of time! Truly a deterrent designed for cats. Coconut and Azuki have both overcome their primal urges! This is only the beginning. What do you mean? This next area is quite challenging... It is called "Catfeather Bridge." No cat can easily resist the urge to follow the fluffy object with their eyes. Some may be drawn in to pounce on it and plummet to their doom... H-How terrifying! They both take off! They've closed their eyes to rush through! Now the only thing left to do is to climb this pillar up to the goal! Azu-nyan is in the lead. I can't catch up to her like this... If I use the cat towers on the sides, I can overtake Azuki! Here I come... Yes! I passed her! Now the goal is right there-- Coco-chan! Idiot. Hurry up and grab the pillar! Oh, good... Thank you... for saving me. You're always making extra work for me. You never change. You tried too hard, that's why you got hurt. But I have so much fun playing with you, Big Sis. Ugh, what a bother. Lemme help! Oh... Wh-What should I do...? Don't touch it! Are you okay? Are you hurt anywhere? Sorry, I... I'm glad you didn't get hurt. I was afraid you got hurt, it chilled me to my bones. Now I've gotten shorter. Wait, so... Back there, you were trying to make sure I wouldn't hurt myself...? Yeah, so? Coco-chan! Azu-nyan! Are you both okay? I'm fine, Azuki saved me. It wouldn't be fun beating someone who wipes out during the race! But we still haven't decided who won. Well, how about for today, we just say it's a tie. Yeah. I'm tired. Let's go back and eat. Huh? What's that all about? Maybe they got it out of their system with exercise. Seems so... Chocola is hungry, too! Okay, let's go home, then. Let's go, Nuts. Wait up, Big Sis! Nuts-chan, did you just call Azuki "Big Sis"? N-No, I... I didn't say that to Azuki, I... Yes, yes. I said, it's not what you think! Reminds me of old times, right? Right! C-Cut it out, all of you! Aren't you happy, Azu-nyan? Don't be shy, both of you. That's not what that was! Did Coconut and Azuki take off already? Yes, they left early-- not a lot of customers today. They wanted to go shopping together on their way back. Huh. I guess they're really close after all. Got it! This is your new bowl, Azuki! Let's see... What? Do you expect me to use that? Yes! It's cute and holds more rice than it looks. Fits Azuki great! Hey, who are you calling built like a child but eats like an adult?! Huh?! I didn't go that far! Hmph! {\an8}"Illustration by: ryota" "Please watch again!"
