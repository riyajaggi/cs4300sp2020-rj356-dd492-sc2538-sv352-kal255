 Is that any fun-- crouching in a corner like that? Crouching won't change anything. Stand up and face forward. Thank you. For scolding me. I'll never forget what happened today. Yay! Three, two, one, bye-bye! Great... Their smiles are so wonderful! It was such a great idea to spend our precious holiday on this, Brother! Yeah. They're all such a great help at work, this is a good break.

 Especially Cacao--she's still a kitten. She should get some time outside. Cacao. You have cream on your face. Chocola. Hmm, what? You have cream on your face. What next? That one. {\an8}"Haunted House" {\an8}"Death" Was the haunted house that scary? You really are easy to scare, aren't you? Wh-What? I'm not scared at all.

 I have to act scared, otherwise I feel bad for the ghosts. Says the one who has to leave the bathroom door open at night. You have to keep the fact that May-chan spreads wide open at night a secret. Hey, stop phrasing it weirdly! You idiot! So no denial...? Maple is still easily scared. Yes, truly... I need to pee. Oh, the restroom? Oh, there it is! Okay, let's go. They seem to be getting along. Chocola is settling into the big sister role. I find that quite moe as well. Oh, what a relief. Thanks for waiting, everyone! Hmm? Where's Cacao? Huh? Oh, no! I-Is she lost?! Where did she go?! Chocola, over there. Oh, there she is! Come on, you can't wander off like that! You want to watch this? Look May-chan! It's Cat Witches! I haven't seen that in a while! Is that the anime from when you were both kittens? It's still on? It's a popular show. The one that Maple and Cinnamon were watching was the first in the series. I think the current one is the third generation. I see. So it must be very different. Oh, but the opening theme song is still the same as before! I see... My dream is to become a singer! I swear I'll make it come true when I grow up! Oh, no! They've both been captured! Now how are we going to rescue the captured kitty?! This is really, really bad! Oh, no! Wait, what is she doing?! What? Did you miss how she enthusiastically volunteered to be taken hostage? Oh, s-someone, please save me! Otherwise, I'm going to get moist! Wow, she's really getting into it. We need the power of song to save the kitty! Who in the audience has the courage to sing at the top of their voices?! Why is nobody raising their hands? Kids these days are very shy. Help! That American Curl cat over there! That cool, elder-sister-posing, but actually easily scared, tsundere cat! Hey, you're up. Huh?! Why should I...? If you help me, I'll keep that thing that happened a secret! That thing? Earlier at the haunted house, you were so scared that you peed-- Hey! What are you trying to reveal to the public?! Fine, I'll go! I'll sing, I'll sing! Ugh, why me...? Sorry, May-chan. You should be! Fine, I'm all in... I'll just sing my best...! ♪ One flight on a broom, in the dark night ♪ ♪ Deliver many stars to you, so just sit tight ♪ ♪ A secret spell, let's cast it together ♪ ♪ Meow! Two! Three! It's magical for you ♪ Great... That's great! I totally got lost in her singing! I was super impressed, too! Good stuff! Truly the pride of the Minaduki family. I got the best picture imaginable...! Wow, so great! Such a great voice! Huh? Um, uh... Um?! Uh... Th-Thank... you. Wow, we enjoyed everything there was to enjoy! Yes, we truly enjoyed it to the core. It really was fun. Especially since I got to hear May-chan's singing for the first time in a while! Okay, it's time. I'm taking off. Good work! Oh, hey, May-chan, wait up! I'm home. You were out late, May-chan. Where were you? None of your business. Oh, I'm so hungry. May-chan...? Yes... Yes, I'll be fine. So, at that time... I'm taking off! Good work. Thank you! Yeah. Good work, both of you! Private phone calls, lack of sleep, sneaking off somewhere... This is suspicious. I'm worried. I can't leave this alone! Huh? What? May-chan?! M-May-chan, what could you possibly be doing out here?! C-Could it be...?! N-No, May-chan! That's too adult a profession... I totally do want to see what that'll be like, --but, no! --Cinnamon? Hey, what are you doing here? N-No! I wasn't following you around secretly because I was worried about you! Part-time job? Oh, but, um... It wasn't like an indecent job or anything like that. "Yamaneko Musical Instruments" It was 100% a healthy and legitimate business. If a customer really wants to, she would let them touch just a little, and for first-time customers, she would teach them the ropes very closely... She just started but is already helping other people out, and... Stop it! How are you able to make everything sound raunchy? What?! No! But why were you working at a music store anyway? Don't we already buy you everything you need? That's... That's because I want to become a singer! May-chan... So I did some research, and I saw that learning an instrument is a good way to get started on learning how to sing well. That's why I wanted to make some money to buy a guitar. A guitar? I thought it would be good to learn an instrument I could play while singing. That could be an entire performance by myself. I see. Well, why didn't you just say so? --Yes, we could just buy you a guitar-- --That defeats the purpose. --Yes, we could just buy you a guitar-- Buying the guitar would be the first step to making my dream come true! I have to do it myself! Maple... Yeah, I understand how you feel. After all, I'm the guy that jumped out of the house to start my own shop. Brother... Oh, right. I think I saw it over here... Oh, here it is. "When: July 13th, 12:00 PM Where: Kanagawa Great Hall" "Prize: White Guitar!!" Why don't you try this out? "Singing Contest In Kanagawa" "Contestants Wanted" Singing contest? ""Prize: White Guitar!!" If you really want to be a singer, this would be a good test, too. Good work, May-chan! Isn't this tough to do in addition to the work at home? Stamina is key to everything. This is only the beginning--I can't complain. You really are working hard. Why were you blowing into plastic bottles and doing that thing with your legs? Oh, that. It trains my lung capacity and abdominal breathing techniques. I see... Oh, I know! Since you're going to sing the Cat Witches theme, why don't you sing in cosplay? Impossible. That outfit is from when we were kittens. There's no way I could wear that. It'll be fine--I can adjust it. No, I won't wear it no matter what. Oh, come on. I wanted to help you. Don't bother. I never asked for help. I'm doing this because I want to! Don't worry! "Voice & Training Channel" "Voice Training Tip #1 Mind your facial muscles, and raise up the tips of your mouth!" The big day is here! B-Bathroom! O-One more time! Again?! Are you sure you're okay? Don't pee yourself on stage! P-Pee?! I'd never do that-- I'm not a kitten anymore! We'll let Cinnamon take care of you backstage, but we'll all be cheering for you at the venue! Huh? All of you? But Kashou, Chocola, and Vanilla have work to do, right? He's taking time off for this special occasion. You're in luck, Maple. Huh...? Wh-Why...? For me? There's no need for that. What are you talking about? It's our precious child's big day. I must engrave the memory in my eyes, or else I would regret this forever. Of course, I will be recording a video and uploading to my blog! Here we are again, the annual singing contest "Song Paradise!" We have local bands, Internet singers, and other competitors today! This is looking like a very high-level competition! The judges will be these great music industry professionals! The event takes place here, at the NKP Hall! What great singing shall we experience today? Our anticipation grows! Maple! "Fight On, Maple!!" "Fight On, Maple!!" We're here for you! "Maple" "Fight On!!" "Fight On!!" "Maple" Good luck! {\an8}"Fight On, Maple!!" It's almost time, but... Where did May-chan go off to? There she is! May-chan... Come on, I was looking all over for you. We have to go now, or else we won't make it. Come on, let's go. May-chan? --No. --Huh? I quit. I'm not going. The other people are all super popular and almost pro. All of the judges are editors for music magazines, famous producers, and people like that. I'd only make a fool of myself by joining. Wh-Where are you going, May-chan?! Home. I don't want to go out of my way just to look bad. What was that for?! Wake up, May-chan... May-chan, you're always so cool! But now... because you don't want to look bad, you want to run away... That's super uncool! But... I can't... Huh? I can't show everyone how miserable I would look! Everyone... helped prepare so much! They took a break from work! Cheered me on! And if I... If I... If after all that, I don't sing well... What if I can't meet everyone's expectations...? Don't worry. Don't worry, May-chan. Hey, remember back when I first came to the Minaduki house? I couldn't fit in, so I was crouched in a corner of the room, and you scolded me. Crouching won't change anything. That's what you said as you took my hand. Remember what we promised then? Can I always be by your side, Maple-chan? So that, in the future, when you are in trouble, I can be there to help you! So, May-chan. If you're afraid, I'll give you a hand. Crouching won't change anything. Cinnamon... Face forward. Contestant number 22... ...Miss Maple Minaduki. Congratulations on winning the prize! Thanks, everyone! I'm glad you got that guitar. Yes. Now, starting tomorrow, I can practice to my heart's content! Hey. Sing something. What?! Yeah, good. I want to hear! I want to hear! B-But you can't all of a sudden... May-chan. I want to hear, too. Fine, then. As a thanks for your support, here's a song. Sing, May-chan... {\an8}"Illustration by Yuuki Hagure" "Please Watch Again!"
