 Yep, all good. Cinnamon, I need to cool the noodles. Get some ice ready, please. Yes. What's wrong, Cinnamon? Hurry-- Heaven... What are you doing? Oh, I can have that, too? Mm... Sloppy as always. Azuki, please take this as well. Yes. Great weather...

 It's very hot today as well. Cinnamon, 92.5 centimeters. You've gotten bigger again. Wh-What?! Is there no limit to this?! Even though Azuki hasn't changed at all! Y-You--! You wanna fight?! --I'm just telling the truth. --And so it begins. Again. --I'm just telling the truth. --And so it begins. Again. --What?! You good-for-nothing giant! --We're home! --Better than being tiny! Like I said, this is technically not "home" anymore. Welcome. Health checks have already begun. Come to the living room when you're ready, okay?

 Okay, pull your chin back a bit. --Okay. --Yes, good. Stay still for just a moment. Cacao, 109 centimeters. Cacao, 109 centimeters, right. Yes, you're growing steadily. Cacao is growing steadily! We are raising her well. Yes! Yes! At this rate, isn't she going to outgrow Azuki really soon? Huh? That's not possible. Who knows? When I was her age, I was already bigger than Azuki. Huh?! You're so full of hot air. What?! Are you making fun of how puffy my face is?! That's not what that means! Do you have potato salad jammed in your ears?! What?! You want some?! Well... Azuki and Coconut haven't shown any signs of growth in this area. Let's wrap this up with our favorite: the kinetic eyesight test. Yes. Remember? You're supposed to tell what the quick thing on the screen is. Please pay attention. Here it comes. {\an8}"I really, really, really, really, really love Shigure-sama" Okay, those who got it, say at once! I really, really, really, really, really love Shigure-sama. Correct. Okay, here's the next one. {\an8}"I want to be by Shigure-sama's side even if it gets hot" I want to be by Shigure-sama's side even if it gets hot. Great. Everyone, you're 100% correct. Okay, this next one is a bit long. {\an8}"We want Shigure-sama to take many photos of us even if they're a bit spicy" We want Shigure-sama to take many photos of us even if they're a bit spicy... Um... Please don't entrap us like that... The fact that you caught that is proof that you've all grown... This is a watermelon. Try it, it's good. See? Like this. Mm, yummy. Hmm? What is it? Oh, that's the seed. You have to spit it out. If you swallow it, watermelons start to grow out of your belly button. Watch, Cacao. Chocola will show you how to do it. Oh, that could be Cacao's first gaze of respect towards Chocola. Huh?! This is the first?! --Yes. --Oh no... But really, this is, like, textbook summer. I know. When I was boiling the noodles, I got all sweaty and icky. But sweating a lot is good for keeping in shape... I don't need to go on a diet! Really? But I like it when you're plumpy. I said I'm not plumpy! When it's hot like this, it makes me want to go to the beach. Oh, good idea. Remember the time we went to the beach after the health checkup? That time, we only dipped our feet into the water. So let's go for a proper swim this time! Chocola would love to go to the beach, too! Same here. Sounds good. Then let's go right away... No. There's something we must do first. Shopping for swimwear? That's the big thing to do? Shigure-sama looked so serious, it made me wonder what she was going to say. What are you talking about? This is Cacao's first proper swimming trip. We must pick the cutest swimwear for her. Chocola agrees that we should get Cacao something super cute, but does everyone else need a new set? I agree. I'll be okay wearing the one you got for me last summer. I-I might actually like to get a new one... Last year's might not fit... I think I'd look good in an adult one, like this one. What are you talking about? You'd do just fine with a loincloth. Why?! May-chan, I think you'd look good with something like this. Sure, if I wanted to get arrested! Really? I think it'd look good on you... What would look good on Cacao? Chocola, the ones for Cacao are over there. The one Chocola picked for Cacao is... ...this! I picked... ...this. The final special one is... ...this! Not that one. Agreed. Right. Now that we've purchased everyone's swimwear, let's take a break then head home. Oh, then let's go to the food court downstairs! The taiyaki there are great! They're extra-packed with red bean paste! What?! That sounds great! Let's go, let's go! Cacao... Where are you going...? Cacao? Cacao, unfortunately, you can't eat that one. This one is for floating on the ocean, and riding on. Cinnamon, you made her more interested in it. What?! Shigure-chan, thank you. Not only did you get us new swimwear, but this, too... It's fine. I intend to make it worth every penn spent. Cacao, before going to the beach, there is a test you need to clear. Which is... ...to put your face in the water! Chocola will show you an example, so watch. Now you try. Don't give Chocola that look. This is the minimum requirement for enjoying the beach. Come on. Chocola will join you. Ready? On three. One, two... three! Wow, Cacao! You did it! Chocola, you're so easily tricked. Huh? Going to the beach? Sure, as long as it's not a work day. I see. Let's meet up at the beach at noon, then. See you. Chocola, I can see you worked hard, but... You need to inflate that at the beach. Oh, no! There! This will be our home base! Why are you acting all "in control" all of a sudden? Hey, everyone! Thanks for waiting! Okay, now that we're all here... Swimming time! There! {\an8}"Celebrating the opening of the love tunnel" Right! Right! Chopstick hand! Not that way! Good! Straight ahead! Why only me?! Because you've got melons. Hmm, really? My collection grows richer... What's wrong, Vanilla? Oh, no... Cacao is missing. {\an8}"Restrooms" --Did you find her? --No... Hey! There she is! If she gets washed out to sea, it'll be bad! Then Chocola will--! No! We have to get a lifeguard... I'll go. Thank you so much. I don't know how to thank you enough... You have our greatest degree of thanks. U-Um, Chocola also gives that thanks. Oh, no, I just did what anyone would do... No! Saving our cat is the same as saving my own life. Please, let me repay you in some way. Um... Well, in that case, can you come to my shop? Shop? {\an8}"Beach Clubhouse Orange" These fried noodles are delicious! The ramen noodles are great, too. For a seaside clubhouse, this is quite adequate... Or rather, quite good. The location is not the best, but... The lack of patronage must be due to lack of advertisement and attention. As a token of our gratitude, we will make this place the most popular on the beach. Huh? {\an8}"Beach Clubhouse Orange HERE!" "Barbecued corn, fried noodles, shaved ice and more!!" Beach Clubhouse Orange is in business! Cute cats everywhere! Mm, delicious! That "Orange" shop at the edge of the beach sure is delicious! I know, right? So good. ♪ Magic makes it shine on, you and the witches ♪ We're working at Beach Clubhouse Orange today! Please visit us for some special service! "Beach Clubhouse Orange GO!!" "Beach Clubhouse Orange! Nearby" Please visit us for some special service! "Beach Clubhouse Orange GO!!" "Beach Clubhouse Orange! Nearby" Hey, take a look at that. "At Beach Clubhouse 'Orange', our cats will be waiting for you!" "First in the business, a beach restaurant with cats"? Sounds fun, let's take a look! Yeah! Really...? "Beach Clubhouse Orange" So many customers...? Barbecued corn and frankfurter, coming up! One lemon shaved ice and one sweet milk shaved ice, understood. Wow, it's hot. At this rate, I'm gonna get cooked, too. Thank you for waiting! Sis, I'll take this curry! Yes, thanks. I'm sorry to make you help in the kitchen, too, after you've done so much already. Please don't worry. We owe you for saving a precious member of our family. Excuse me, can we order? Y-Yes! Right away! Someone, please take her order! Sorry! Too busy over here! --What?! --Um... U-Um, please wait one moment-- Go ahead. Oh, yes... {\an8}"Beach Clubhouse Orange" "Closed" Wow, we worked hard today. I know, right? I thought we came to play, how did we end up like this? Well, we had fun, right? Thank you very much for today. We're so glad to be of service. We inherited this shop from our parents, and it has never been this popular. It's thanks to Shigure's plans all working out. Great as always, Shigure-sama! It's thanks to your hard work. Thank you all very much. Cacao, you worked very hard, too! Cacao is a good girl. I had lots of fun, too! But... we were only popular today because the kitties were here... Um, about that. There's something I'd like to discuss. Coming up next, the super popular beach clubhouse with cats! Huh? Hi, everyone, please come visit us at Beach Clubhouse Orange! Can't wait to see you! Is this...? Yes, they seemed like nice people, so I introduced them to some cats who were looking for a home. They say cats bring good luck. Now that clubhouse is destined for success. Also... There is nothing better than life with cats. Hey! Welcome! Welcome to La Soleil! {\an8}"Illustrated by Sayori" "Thanks for watching meow!"
