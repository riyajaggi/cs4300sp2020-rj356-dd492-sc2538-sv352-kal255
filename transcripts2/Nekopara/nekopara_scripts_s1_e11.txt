 Yeah, one second. I know, Cacao! You can come to my house one of these days! Then we can play a lot! Hmm? What is it, Cacao? Hungry? I want to go. Go where? Chiyo's house. What?! You don't even have a bell yet, how are you going to get there? You might get lost again! Oh, that sounds good! You're always welcome anytime! Why don't you come sleep over next holiday?

 Thanks, Mom! Cacao, will you come sleep over? C-Cacao... A sleepover?! You see? These are your pajamas, and new underwear. Also, toothbrush, toothpaste. A hot water bottle and a body warmer just in case it gets cold. Alarm clock, ready. Bath set, good to go. As for the dried fish, I have a dozen business-use packages. {\an8}"Dried Fish" As for the dried fish, I have a dozen business-use packages. Also... Also... Oh! Here it is! Here's Mr. Bear! He was Chocola's favorite when Chocola was small. If you feel lonely, you can think about Chocola and hug him! Do we have everything? Don't worry, I sewed our contact information on the backpack! Yes! Vanilla, always so reliable! Phew. Is this good enough? --Cacao! --Hey, hey, come on, guys. Cacao's just spending one night, right? She doesn't need that much stuff. No, that's not accurate, Master! This is the perfect sleepover set, with every contingency in mind! Yes! You're exaggerating... Besides, she can't carry that much... Yes... I'm sorry. Cacao! Over here! Welcome! Thank you for allowing Cacao to stay with you. I hope she isn't too much trouble for you. Of course, I'm happy to have her here. Whoa... Shigure- chan is being a grown-up... We must follow her lead... Ahem... I hope Cacao is too much trouble for you. Huh? Too much? No, Chocola, you mean "not" too much trouble. Yes, not too much trouble. Oh, of course! Don't mention it. {\an8}"Shigure Minaduki" This is my contact information. Please don't hesitate to call me for any reason. I understand. Cacao, make sure you find out where the toilet is right away. Don't forget to say thank you for the food after dinner. Yes. Is she going to be all right? Don't worry, Cacao is a smart kitten. I assure you she'll be okay. Oh, I know. Take this, Cacao. Not yet. Read it first thing after you get inside the house. Let's go, Cacao. Yes. --Oh... --Cacao... Let's go, both of you. B-But... Still worried... They say, if you love your child, you have to let them see the world. I think this is a great chance for Cacao to learn and grow. Three shortcakes. Would that be all? We're home. Welcome back. How was it? Was it a tear-jerking, melodramatic separation? O-Of course not! Really? Are you sure you didn't wave at her, crying about never letting her go? It would be cute if Chocola did that, though! No! Chocola is no longer a baby! Both Chocola and I can spend one night away from Cacao... Huh, the cacao... We've run out of cacao beans. Can someone refill this? O-Oh, right... For a moment I thought Cacao came back... You two totally haven't let go of her at all... Here you are. You can relax like this is your own house, Cacao. What's that, Cacao? "Hello, my name is Cacao. I hope my presence here does not inconvenience you." {\an8}"Kaminari-Okoshi" Please take this as a token of my gratitude. Oh, Kaminari-Okoshi. Thank you! Wow, Cacao! You're such a grown-up! So, this Fondant Chocomeow... Chocola, you're tripping on words. Oh... Th-Three Fonmewo Chocomeow... Three Fondant Chocolats coming up. Vanilla! Too many! Oh... I've let my attention slip. Excuse us! We'll fix this right away! Are they okay? They must be concerned about Cacao. How cute. They're still kittens after all. Over here, Cacao! Boo! What are you making, Cacao? Dried fish. I... see. Very big. Need help with something? Yes, get me the bowls. Okay. Let's see, bowls... What's wrong, Chocola? N-No! It's nothing, Master! Oh, I forgot that Cacao isn't here. Today's dish is soy sauce-boiled dried fish. Your favorites, right? Cacao loves dried fish, too... Chocola wonders what Cacao's eating now. Master, please save it until tomorrow. We'll eat it with Cacao. O-Oh... Okay. Yum! Mom's hamburger is great! Oh, Cacao! You eat your veggies properly! I'm so glad! I'll try, too! This way. This is our bath! Let's go in together. Hmm? Cacao, do you not like baths? I see... Oh, I know! Look, come here, Cacao! Let's play with these toys together! Then... Here! Wow, Cacao, you're bold! Do you want to try? Wow! Hey! How's that? Enough? Don't sigh, it makes your luck fade away. Oh, um, right. H-Hey! That tickles, Vanilla! Chocola can do that, too! Today was a long day. Chocola? The bathtub is... bigger than usual. No, it's the same size. Are you sure? All done. {\an8}"Thanks mom" Oh, that's my mother. Mother...? I drew it as a present for Mother's Day. Mom is always working so hard, so I wanted to thank her. Mom was really happy! Hey, Vanilla. What is it, Chocola? The bath, too, but... The bed is bigger tonight, too. Yes, I know. Cacao isn't here. A while ago, you tried so hard to pretend like everything is normal. I tried to act normal to make sure you don't get sadder. Thanks, Vanilla. Don't mention it... Chocola never thought about it this way, but... Having Cacao nearby has become normal for us. Yes... When Cacao comes back, let's sleep together again. Of course. But for tonight, I have Chocola all to myself. What? Vanilla, you're choking Chocola... Sorry, can't let go. Thank you very much for allowing Cacao to stay with you. It was our pleasure to have her over. Please come again, Cacao! Yes. Cacao! Come to us, now! Jump into our arms! Cacao? Where are you going? Cacao? We're coming in... {\an8}"Business Size" "Dried Fish Pack" What is this?! {\an8}"Business Size" "Dried Fish Pack" What is this box...? Is Cacao in here...? Hello? What?! No... Thank you. Oh, she must be in what's called a rebellious phase. Rebellious phase?! Nuts used to be so cute when she was smaller. I'm home. Big Sis! Welcome home! That's how respectful she was of me. We have never seen... ...Coconut do that... Now she's all grown up, and all that cuteness is gone... Hmph! Cacao is preparing to grow up as well. You should leave her alone, don't force yourselves into her life. Really...? Is that right...? Excuse us... Though this is our own room... She's still doing something inside. We must successfully enter into conversation with Cacao. Miss Cacao? Be a good girl and come out? Did she forget who we are just by spending one night away from us...? That's impossible... We'll bring everyone in on this, and have Cacao come out no matter what! Come and get some fresh cooked saury. It's hard to find them this time of the year. --No. --Ouch! My eyes are getting really itchy for some reason. You're just imagining it. Let's cook it more and make it smell better... Whoa, what are you doing?! It's full of smoke! Oh, no! Open the windows! That was a fail. We got not only the scent, but the smoke as well. We almost smoked ourselves. Guys... Like I said before, it's just a phase. Just leave her alone. That won't fly... We're worried about Cacao! I know! I have a great idea. Here, May- chan . What's this? It's a portable karaoke system. Huh? Why should I sing? It's Project Amano-Iwato! Amano-Iwato? There's an old story about a goddess who hid herself behind a big rock. The people got her to come out by having a fun festival outside. So if we had a big party outside... Cacao will get curious and come out on her own! What kind of fairy tale is this? Please, May- chan ! Help us with your fantastic voice! I want to hear! Ugh... Fine. ♪ One flight on a broom, in the dark night ♪ ♪ Deliver many stars to you, so just sit tight ♪ --♪ A secret spell, let's cast it together ♪ --Oh, I'm getting moist! --♪ A secret spell, let's cast it together ♪ --What are you getting all aroused for?! --♪ A secret spell, let's cast it together ♪ ♪ Meow! Two... ♪ Cacao! Shush. Oh, no! It can't be... Even I was kind of hurt... Come on, enough already! You all understand now, just leave her alone. Yes... So Cacao still won't come out? Yes, she's been in there since morning... Still in that box. What's going on? She's never missed a meal before. Soy sauce-boiled dried fish! Yes, with this favorite dish of hers... ...her hunger should surely...! Master! Please go ahead and eat without us! We will take care of Cacao! Yeah, go ahead. Miss Cacao? Getting hungry yet? Here's Master's hand-made soy sauce-boiled dried fish. Look, it's your favorite, Cacao! Oh, no! Only the plate came back... What to do... Is there nothing we can do but wait? Chocola, I think we've come down to the final option. Y-Yes... Azu- nyan told us to leave her alone, but we're worried, so... The only thing we can do is... ...enter by force! Here we go! Ow... Cacao! We were so worried! What happened?! "To Chocola and Vanilla. Thank you for always playing with me." "When I am bored, you played with me using a ball. Or using a cat teaser. Thank you." "Thank you for showing me the ocean. It was very big and I was surprised. Thank you for taking me to the amusement park. It was very fun." {\an8}"Thank you for letting me eat lots of moving sushi. It was delicious." "Thank you for saying you want me to stay with you here. I was very happy. Thank you." Cacao... For us? This... For us...? Chocola, Vanilla, I love you. We'll always be together. Cacao! Thank you. Chocola loves you, too! Yes, we really will always be together! {\an8}"Illustration by Poyoyon Rock (Front Wing) "Please watch again!"
