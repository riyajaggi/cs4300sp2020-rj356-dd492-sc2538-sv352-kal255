 Good morning. A little more. Well done. So cute... Right? She's so cute, Chocola's heart throbs! Yes, she is cute, too. But Chocola taking care of someone is cute. What?! Chocola?! Let's eat! Hmm? Where's the new one? What? She was here just a moment ago...

 I take my eyes off for one moment, and she becomes so delicious... No, no... There you are! Why are you eating here? Here, come out now. Come, let's eat together. What's this, Vanilla? Some reason or another. Here you go. We're going to go help the master now. You should relax and watch TV. You use it like this. "Early summer at the Katase Port, full of fresh fish!" "Breakfast at the directly-shipped fish market!" We are at the fish market today! Look at this magnificent bonito!

 Here, you can eat fresh fish straight out of the ocean. Unfortunately, that's not edible. You must like bonito. Chocola loves bonito, too. Oh, if we lived in the ocean, we could eat fish all the time. Ocean...? Oh, have you never seen the ocean? It's awesome! It's like, huge, and salty, and cold... Anyway, it's awesome! Chocola. Your explanation is completely inadequate. Huh? What?! Welcome. I will take your order please. First player... Rook to 2F. That's an interesting move... Yes... Indeed. This is a fairly good move for what it's worth. It could be followed by a Pawn to 3F. I see, that's this one here. Yes, and if that is followed by this... Thank you for waiting. Here is the Darjeeling you ordered. Thank you. Please enjoy. The cakes here are delicious. I know right? This place is my favorite. The cats are so cute, too. I might want to come back again, too. Oh, I haven't seen her before. So small and cute! Oh, hey! S-Sorry, she is different! Hey, you can't come out-- we have customers out here. We are still working, so go back to the room and play. Good. Oh, it's you. What are you doing here? Master is engaged in exotic role-playing. Wh-What?! No! What are you talking about, Vanilla! What's going on? Could that be... blindfold play?! Such stimulating, perverted activities, during work... H-Hey... But if Kashou- san did that to me suddenly... Oh, Cinnamon would become moist! Hey, watch what you're saying. The whole shop can hear you. Sorry to startle you. Here, have this cake as a token of my apology. It's called a cacao cake. It's good. She eats well. Master's cakes are exquisite. It seems like you like it. Master is such a cat-swindler. --Thank you for the food! --Thank you for the food. Thanks. Oh, it was delicious! Well, back to work for us! Oh, um... I know! Vanilla, we still have some time, right? Yes, we do. Maple and Cinnamon are here, too. Right! Then let's play for a bit! Ouch... Chocola! Hey, break time is over soon. Shh... She fell asleep. Yes, sound asleep. We're off, then! Be careful. Yes! Good luck to you, too. Monthly health check. We measure our height and weight and see how big we got. Look forward to hearing about how much we've grown. Please take some time to rest, Master! Yeah, I'll make the best out of this break and relax for a change. What?! Are you saying that we cats are preventing you from relaxing?! No, that's not what I meant... Don't worry. Master's body can no longer resist being apart from ours. What does that even mean? Maple, 157 centimeters. May- chan , 157 centimeters. I guess that's about right. Next, please. Azuki is 142 centimeters. {\pos(396,608)}"Health Notebook" Tiny as always, huh? What did you say?! Oh, did I strike a nerve? You have some nerve, poking fun at my physique like that! Okay, time to take weights now. Yes. Uh-oh, I gained a bit... Nuts- chan is at fifty-- Hey! Don't say it out loud! Life as a big eater must be hard. Did your belly grow a bit? I'd take that over a short-legged, tiny body any day. What did you just say? Um, short legs and tiny body? What?! Do you want some of this?! Fine, but don't give up too quickly! Bring it! You're going down! Hey, stop it. We're measuring now. --But Nuts...! --But Azuki...! No buts! Stop now, or no snacks for you! Wow, they never grow tired of that, do they? Azu- chan and Nuts- chan are so friendly with each other. We're home! Our home is now Master's house. This is not our home, to be exact. Then what should Chocola have said? Like, "Behold" or "Ahoy"? Welcome! This is your first measurement. Chocola is the same as the last time, a fully-grown adult cat now. Chocola is 152 centimeters. Okay, stand there. One hundred eight centimeters. Oh, what's her name, anyway? Oh, right. We're taking her in now, so we should give her a proper name. I think we settled on "Sugarcane." Azuki, you're still going with that? But it's delicious. Then "Cheese!" Hmm, that is delicious, too... How about Macaron? I like short cakes! Tuna. Umm... S-Sausage...? Scones. Mugwort! Stop, you're just naming your favorite foods now. She's right. It's her name, it should be something she likes. In that case... Dried fish. Seriously? I mean, she does seem to like it. Not cute. Overruled. Cacao cake? Oh, that sounds good! She really seemed to like Kashou- san 's cacao cake. Yeah! That sounds good. So... Cacao... How about Cacao? Cute name! I think it's great. Sounds good. I can live with that. What do you think about Cacao? Yes, Cacao! Cacao is 18 kilograms. Cacao, 18 kilograms. So small and light! She might be smaller than when I was a kitten. Cacao, 53 centimeters. Fifty-three centimeters. Chocola, 75 centimeters. Seventy-five centimeters! Vanilla, 70 centimeters. Seventy centimeters. Yay! Chocola beat Vanilla in both breasts and height! I'm happy to see Chocola happy. And heavier than Vanilla, too. Please don't remind me... Cinnamon, 92 centimeters. Overwhelming mega-size. Huge, as always. On par with Coconut. You've gotten bigger than the last time. Oh, really? It's okay, I like both big and small. C-C-Cacao?! What are you doing?! Cacao, c-could you be...? Are you remembering your mother...? B-But... please... ...you have to stop! Good work, everyone. To wrap things up, it's time to check your kinetic vision. Is everyone ready? Here it goes. Yes! Coconut. It was a mouse. Correct. One point to Coconut. Yes! I guess I was a bit slow. You just have to tell what showed up quickly on the TV. It's where we let show off our cat powers. Next question. I think I got it. A rabbit? Correct. One point to Cinnamon. Yay! What's wrong, Azuki? You haven't even gotten a single point yet. Shut it. I'm just warming up. Okay, continuing on. Hawk! Tiger! Grasshopper! Correct. Three points to Azuki. That's how it's done. Okay, next one coming. Shigure, please don't show us that... You all need to grow up and get used to this. Chocola, you have very un-cat-like vision... This last one is hard. Huh...? Wasn't that too fast? Hmm... I don't know... Hah, I saw it. It was "I really, really, really, love Shigure- sama ." Wrong. Huh... What?! Pay more attention. It makes me sad that you can't see this. What's wrong, Cacao? Did you figure out the asnwer? "I really, really, really, really, love Shigure- sama. " Correct! "I really, really, really, really, love Shigure- sama " She read that one? Impressive. Great, Cacao! One more time. Say the answer again, one more time. That's all for today's measurements! Done and done. What should we do now? I saw a nice-looking shop nearby. Wanna go check it out? It might be a good time for a walk. Chocola, you guys are still free, right? Actually, Chocola was thinking of a place to take Cacao. What do you think? A place to take Cacao? Yes! Isn't this awesome, Cacao? The ocean is so close. We were so surprised when the master brought us here! First time at the ocean; it was fun. Look! Great, isn't it? The ocean! Wow, a big pond! The ocean is wonderful. Yes... Here, over here. Too early to go in. Don't worry, it's not scary! Just salty. Bonito, fatty tuna-- they're all in this big ocean. Chocola, "fatty tuna" isn't the name of a fish. Huh? Wait, you didn't know either? Huh? Well... Of course I knew! Fatty tuna is the name of a part of a tuna. Yeah, that's it! It's shaped like a V, like this! Okay, Cacao, let's play! There! Oh, no! Wow, we sure did play! I'm starving! Indeed! So hungry! I can have like ten bowls of rice now. That's way too much. Let's come back again when it's swimming season. Yeah! I'm so going to swim a lot again this year! Did you enjoy it, Cacao? Next time we come, Chocola will teach you how to swim. It's not scary, once you get used to it. We should pack some lunches. Sounds good. Let's make lots. All right! Fried chicken, rolled egg, you name it! I'll make lots of inarizushi . Salmon sounds good. Sausages and hamburgers! Also grilled cheese on meat! Nuts, you eat too much meat. Strawberry cake for Chocola, with lots of cream! Chocola, that's a terrible lunch. Huh? Really? {\pos(190,652)}"Illustration by Orion" {\pos(1006,640)}"Please watch again!"
