 Where are you? Come out, please. Don't hide. What are you doing Shigure? It's still early. Well, I can't seem to find her. By "her," you mean her? I thought she slept in your room last night. Is she lost? Huh? How does anyone get lost inside the house? She's not you, you know. What?! --Oh, you want some? --You're going to feel the hurt. --Stop it, that's no way to start the day. --You're going to feel the hurt. --Stop it, that's no way to start the day. --Huh? You're just bigger--nothing to it. --You two really have a lot of energy. --Huh? You're just bigger--nothing to it.

 --You two really have a lot of energy. --How can I lose to you? You really are loud for someone so small! What is it? Wh-What are you doing there...? I guess the toilet seat is really warm... I wonder if she's eating right now? Hmm? What is it? That's not jam; that's soy sauce-boiled laver. You're so clumsy so early. So cute. Th-This isn't me being clumsy! This is super delicious! The way you make excuses is cute, too. Wait, this really is delicious! I didn't expect that plot twist... Did she brush her teeth properly? Chocola. --Huh? --That... "Changing now" I shouldn't worry. Shigure-chan is there, and so is everyone else. I shouldn't worry. Shigure-chan is there, and so is everyone else. I'm not worried at all, not one bit. She's just... slightly on my mind. I'm more worried about Chocola... H-Huh?! Are you really that worried about her? Where is your house? What's your name? We never actually found out what her name was. Hey, Sugarcane! Make sure to wash your hands before you eat! "Sugarcane"? Her name. It's inconvenient to not have a name, right? Convenient or not, you should at least put effort into giving her a decent name... "How to name a baby kitten, naming" "How to name a baby kitten" "Cat names ranking" "How to name a baby kitten"...? Oh, a baby... Meaning, p-pistil and stamen, nine months gestation... What are you filling your head with first thing in the morning? Stop. You're a bad influence on the kitten. Don't look, don't listen, Sugarcane! No, Azuki. You must not give her a name without permission. If she is a lost kitten, she must have a real name. Also, put your phone away when eating, Maple. That's impolite. Yes, sit there. Who's a good kitty? Who's a good kitty? Okay, everyone, all together. Let's eat. --Let's eat. --Let's eat. Oh? Where has she gone off to? Wh-When did she...? Good work, both of you. We'll take over--take a break. Oh, Azu-nyan, Coco-chan! Um... How is she doing? She? Oh, Sugarcane. "Sugarcane"? Hey, Azuki. Shigure-sama told you not to name her without permission. She's doing fine, by the way. Ate a full breakfast, no problem. She does have a habit of disappearing and reappearing somewhere incredible, though. I know! She's so delusive! I think you mean "elusive." Well, it's fine. She doesn't cry or cause trouble. No effort required. I see... Well, I'm glad she's doing well! She likes dried fish, so she'll appreciate it if you give her some as a snack. Ah, I see. I'll try sometime. Right, so for now, there are no mentions of lost cats matching her description. Thank you very much. Let's see... Lost cats, lost cats... "Lost cats, search request, rescue cats" "Lost cat info" "Lost cat message board" Let's see... Lost cats, lost cats... "Lost cat info" Let's see... Lost cats, lost cats... I gotta be sharp--I'm the big sister now! I've gotten used to the job now. I can handle this! I-I'm such a bad big sister... Hey, Nuts, go grab some to-go boxes from the back. I need all sizes. They're heavy, so be careful! Yeah! You can count on me for heavy lifting! Always needing help, that one. Well, back to work for me, too, I guess. Thank you for waiting! Two season's special short cakes, one cherry cassis cheesecake, three crème brûlées... Six items comes out to... "Credit 1" "Credit 2" three crème brûlées... Six items comes out to... {\an8}"Total 2,200 Yen" Two thousand, two hundred yen. Wow! Thank you, come again! Azuki is awesome as usual. She is the Minaduki family's elder cat, after all. She has a huge experience point pool. Jeez, this shop really makes its cats work hard. Azuki, I refilled the to-go boxes. Oh, thanks. There seems to be fewer customers now, want me to help out here? There's nothing out here that needs help. You're just a kitten. Don't stretch yourself too thin. Hmm. Look who's stretching now, huh, Azuki? Huh?! Th-This is... Come on, don't be stubborn and just ask for help. Shut up, you--! Well, go ahead, then, see if you can reach. Don't worry about them; that's business as usual. No problem. Today, we're at the popular aquarium! Let's go inside! Wow, so pretty! Are you hungry? Good timing. It's three o'clock, let's have tea. Wow, May-chan, this is quite impressive. They say the first time is the most important, right? I have to make sure to teach her what's good. I see. Well, I'll help myself, then. Hold on! Huh? Darjeeling is one of the three great teas of the world. It's best to drink it straight. Assam for milk, and this is Earl Grey. Umm... May-chan, what are you doing? Like I said, the first time is important. Elite training, I guess. "Maple's Tea Lesson" Look. To make delicious tea, you need to mind the water temperature. Boil fresh water at 100 degrees, and pre-pour some hot water into the cups and pots to warm them up. Put in the tea leaves, pour the boiled water, and let it sit for a moment. Take care not to let the temperature drop. I guess that's it for now. Huh...? Hmm? {\an8}"Dried Fish" Oh, there you are. You prefer that over the afternoon tea setup we prepared for you? Well, you know what they say, different strokes for different cats. Oh, good, she seems to like it. I don't know what to say. You like it? Good, good. Had enough? That's super high-class, ordered by Shigure-chan. "Japanese Folk Tales" A long time ago, there lived an old man and an old woman. One day, the old woman... I'm home, Mom! Welcome home, Dad! Would you like to eat first? Bathe first? Or... ...me first?! Come on! Let's play! See? Look, you jump like this! It's tons of fun! What are you doing, both of you? She seemed lonely, so we thought we should play with her. But she wouldn't respond to anything... Let's leave her alone for the moment. She just needs some more time, I think. Here are the toys the Minaduki family cats have played with over the years. You can use whichever one you like. Oh, that's an old favorite. Chocola played with it when she was small. Thank you for your purchase! Please come again. Good work, both of you. Well, we'll take off, then. Hey, Azu-nyan! Um... Hmm? What? I-It's nothing, sorry. Thanks! Yes, it's fine! No problem. She's fine, I'm sure. Okay, back to work, then! I'm home. Hey, where's Sugarcane? Come on, Azuki, what did I tell you about giving a name without permission? Please go get her, dinner is almost ready. Yes. Huh? She's not here... That's odd. I can't find her. Maybe she's outside the house. Let's all look for her together. Hey, Sugarcane... Where did you go? It's dinner. Come back, please! I have no choice but to use this... Cats love matatabi! Don't do it, Nuts! Stop, that will... That would happen, yes. Hello, this is Patisserie La Soleil. Hey, Shigure-chan. What's up? Uh-huh. What are you doing?! Where do you think you're going? We're still open. She, uh... She's missing, and... ...Shigure-chan said... They looked all over the house, her shoes are missing, too, so, like, um... Yes, I understand. I can handle things here, you go look for her. B-But the shop... No problem--don't worry. I can handle it alone. We'll join you as soon as we close up here. Go, hurry. Thank you much, Vanilla! Thank you so much, Master! Where are you?! Where are you? Talk to me if you're here! Sugarcane! Where did you go? Hey, Nuts, you look over there. I'll head that way. Got it. W-Wait! Oh, I-I'm sorry... Wrong cat. Have you seen a kitten? No... She wears a hat, about this tall... No... What if she's lonely? What if she's scared? What if she's crying? I have to find her...! Not here... I thought maybe she would be here, but... Where did you go...? Here. Wh-What?! Come on, why did you disappear on your own like that?! We were so, so, so worried! With you. Huh? I want to be with you. I'm so glad you're safe! You got us all worried! I'm glad you weren't hurt or in an accident. Indeed. Well, it's late. Perhaps we should go. Um, Master! Yeah? What's up? This is my once-in-a-lifetime request! You can cut my food in half! I will dress and bathe her. I will potty train her! You can scold me if she causes trouble! So please... Let me keep her here! Please! Master. Chocola's wishes are my own. I ask you, too... Please. You know, I don't remember ever saying that you can't have her here. Th-Then...! Yeah, as long as you take good care of her. I only have the two of you in this house. Yes, yes! Now we can be together! Yes, yes! Now we can always be together! {\an8}"Illustration by Kaguyuzu"
