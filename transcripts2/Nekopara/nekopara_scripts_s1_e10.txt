 Thank you for waiting. Here is your Darjeeling. Three Mont Blancs and melt-in-mouth puddings... --Four puddings. --Oh, sorry about that. Don't worry about it. Thank you! Cacao, you know what? I made pancakes with my mom the other day! --They're good friends now. --It was super fluffy and delicious. We're going to do it again soon! --The shop is doing well, too. Good business. --It was super fluffy and delicious. We're going to do it again soon! ♪ What's for dinner tonight?! ♪ Whoa! It's seared tuna! Yay!

 Delicious! Hey! What did I tell you about stealing a bite before dinner?! --Oh... --Are you sure you're ready for the renewal? Renewal? I got the notification for renewing your bell. Renewing the... bell? Remember you got certified to wear your bell? Yes! Chocola is a great cat who earned her bell! Yes, and now you have to take a test to renew it. Last time we took the test, I remember someone mentioning the need to renew. --Huh...? --Human society changes all the time. They have to make sure you're adapting, I suppose. What if we don't pass the test? Your bell is revoked.

 No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no... You, too, Vanilla? Thanks! Chocola will be fine. We just have to pass the test, that's all. What's a bell? Huh? We never explained it properly to Cacao. Oh, right. You see, cats without a bell can't walk around outside without a human. If you get caught, who knows what they'll do to you... But if a cat is wearing a bell, the cat can go out alone. The bell means the cat can successfully navigate within human society. You take a test, and if you pass, you get a bell! You're tested on your knowledge of human rules and norms, whether you're able to resist feline instincts and urges, and whether you're able to behave rationally. And! Chocola and Vanilla are great cats who passed the test in one go! Hmm? Do you want a bell, too, Cacao? Yes. You're still small. You're not old enough to take the test. Let's go get you one as soon as you're a bit older. I see. Let's hope you can get that bell soon! Yes... When you get a bell, let's go out together! Thank you for waiting. Here is your strawberry shortcake. Thank you. Enjoy. Oh, no! I-I'm so sorry! I-I'll get a towel right away... --Are you okay? --There's no rush. I'm sorry... So sorry... Let's train. --Now what kind of cat will we be visiting today? --Train? --Now what kind of cat will we be visiting today? --At this rate, there's a risk we could fail the bell renewal test. --Now what kind of cat will we be visiting today? --At this rate, there's a risk we could fail the bell renewal test. --I've been told that the cat's name is Bob and they bring happiness. --Huh? We'll be fine. --I've been told that the cat's name is Bob and they bring happiness. Chocola is a great cat who passed the test in one shot after all! Then how about this? Chocola can't help it--Chocola is a cat! Okay, Cacao, then. Cacao can do it. Oh, no... Chocola, you need to show that you're a big sister who can do it right. You don't want to fail the test and lose your bell, do you? Right... Then let's do this. I'll accompany you. Got it! Chocola will do her best! And so... Help us, teachers! I get it! You can count on us. Rest easy--we've got this. So let's start with... Yeah! Go! Chocola, stretch out the wrinkles. Sorry... The kitchen is a warzone. There's no room for tears! So hot... They say, keep a cool head, and even fire can feel cool. Hot is hot. There's no way to deny that! Fight on! You're almost done! But... You can have ice cream when you're done! Ice cream?! Delicious! So tired. Ice cream after training is great. Training? Yes, training! Were we... actually training? Oh! Were we perhaps... ...just helping with chores...? Well, so, um... It's not what it seems. We just wanted to see how well you can do... How about some tea? We'll do proper training, too! Here. I anticipated that this would happen... "Bell Exam - Book of Secrets" So I prepared this! That's...! What is that? --Hey. --This is the "Bell Manual - Book of Secrets." It's a textbook to prepare you for the bell test. Ah. Don't you remember? We used it last time. Huh? Oh, of course! Come on, let's train! Secret number one! Check the door when leaving the house! First, you must perfectly learn the rules of human society. When leaving the house, lock the door properly. Yes. --Check! --Check! Secret number six! Obey traffic laws. Look right, look left. Good. Azuki-sensei! Yes, Miss Chocola? Why do we raise our hands when we cross the street? Good question. It's to make us more visible to drivers. Ah. However, the National Public Safety Commission no longer recommends this. Huh. Secret number ten! Learn to ride the train. Nice dive. That's wrong, Cacao! Watch Chocola do it. Touch the pass on this machine and move through quickly-- Not having enough money in the pass or not touching the machine properly can lead to death. Welcome home! All right, my training is super realistic! Vanilla, you're out! Secret number 15! Don't enter random boxes. Secret number 21. Always keep your cool and stay calm. Come on... Are you sure you're okay like that? Are you sure you're okay like that? I'm not the one taking the test! Ahem. Anyway, next. Secret number 28! Control your instincts. Don't react instinctively. I am not easily tempted by such things. No chewing your nails either! No punching holes in the paper doors, okay? Resist, resist. See? Even if another cat does it right in front of you, you have to resist. Shigure-sama?! No, this isn't... I mean, this is training, and... Cinammon-sensei's intellectual and elegant training begins! Secret number 39! Don't accept things from strangers! I'll play the stranger role, so let's practice, okay? --Yes. --Understood. You girls want a snack? That's not so much a stranger, but... More like a pervert. Secret number 45! Learn your toilet etiquette. Let me check. No, thanks. Secret number 50! Study hard. You see? Flowers have a pistil and a stamen. The se... I mean, pollen from the stamen... Inseminate... I mean, pollinates the pistil. Then a baby... Cinnamon. That's quite enough of that. What?! But I'm not even moist yet! What are you even doing? Maple-sensei! Looks like it's my turn. Secret number 63! Learn to go shopping. Vanilla, please get some milk. Chocola, you can get granulated sugar. Got it! Understood. Hmm? Cacao, can you help, too? Okay, in that case, can you get some mayonnaise? Yes. {\an8}"Open 24 hours" Milk, milk... {\an8}"Dried fish" That was fast. Here you are! "Nyao Nyull Premium" "Nyao Nyull Premium" Huh? I asked for granulated sugar. Master always says Cacao is allowed to buy one snack! You should learn from Cacao. Oh... Secret number 82. Don't climb to a place you can't come down from. I'll show an example, okay? S-See? I can't come down... Wow. Impressive, Cacao! Secret number 90. Learn to get vaccinated with a smile. That's not... possible! {\an8}"Meow the Hospital" "Vaccinations available" All right, let's do a tough one for the end! Secret number 99. Don't be afraid of water. Chocola loves baths! I know. I'm very tired. But after all that training, we're sure to pass the test! It's okay. Don't be afraid. See? The duck is swimming, too. That's great, at such a young age. Yes, she's great. Hopefully, Cacao can take the test soon, too. She will pass in one go. Yes! Cacao is a genius! {\an8}"Unaccompanied Activities License Renewal Examinations" Chocola, Vanilla, are you both ready? We're ready, Shigure-chan! Impressive, Vanilla. Yes, I am. But you know what? Tickle, tickle! This is what happens when Chocola does it. That's because it's Chocola. Well, best of luck to both of you. Yes, this is exact. Thank you. They should have started right about now. I hope they pass. Vanilla should be fine, but Chocola is a risk. She's super clumsy. I agree. She always causes so much trouble... But she's too innocent to get mad at. True. Cacao. Don't do that. You'll never get a bell that way. Shigure-chan! We passed! Congratulations. Of course, Chocola is a bona fide great cat! To be honest, I was worried about you. Oh? Another miracle. As a sort of celebration, shall we go someplace fun? Yay! In that case, we can go see an aurora... Or perhaps a visit to the moon can be an option... They passed! Great! I was worried. I'm so glad my effort to teach them things paid off! Why are you looking at me like that? Um... "Changing now" We kind of get it. "Changing now" Say no more. "Changing now" {\an8}"Kinryuzan" "Kaminarimon" Wow... So big! Look, look! It's so high! --No, that's not it. --Huh? Don't drink directly. Cleanse your hand, put the water in there, and then rinse out your mouth. Ah. {\an8}"Omikuji 100 yen" Oh, no! {\an8}"Souvenir Kaminari Okoshi" "Kaminari Manju" "Kaminari Okoshi" "Kaminari Okoshi Gift Set" {\an8}"Asakusa Round Yokan" "Peach Sweet Mochi Cake" "Good Fortune Manju" "Chestnut Paste Daifuku" "Daimon Cooked Mochi" So many different shops! --In the future we can have a Soleil branch here... --Souvenir. --In the future we can have a Soleil branch here... Oh, for Chiyo-chan? That would be nice. We should get something for the master and the others. Yeah, let's! Hmm, but which one? --What's that? --They told me a wooden sword is a standard souvenir. Ah. That's odd. Have you decided? Well, not yet... "Kaminari Okoshi" "Ningyoyaki" Why so many?! "Kaminari Okoshi" "Ningyoyaki" It's for my dearest brother and my dearest cats! "Potato Yokan from Imocho" "Kaminari Okoshi" I would buy much more if I could! Can we carry all that back...? We'll need to use White Cat Nyamato's Parcel Delivery Service. {\an8}"Octopus" "Gizzard shad" "Squid" "Sweet Shrimp" {\an8}"Yellow jack" "Tuna" "Fatty tuna" "Medium-fatty tuna" {\an8}"Bonito" "Tuna and onion" "Yellowtail" "Conger eel" So many fishes coming my way... Take anything you like. --Anything?! --Are you sure?! --Yes. --Thank you, Shigure-chan! Hey, Chocola! What are you doing?! You have to take the whole plate. The textbook said so. Really? You got your bell, please live up to it. Yes. Let's eat. Let's. Boy, we ate a lot! Thank you. Did you like it? Yes. I'm glad. So, what's next? Anywhere else you'd like to visit? About that... Chocola would like to visit a café. A café? Yes. By studying another café, maybe we can help make the master's store much better than it is now. That's a wonderful idea! That's my Chocola. Know thyself and know others and do not fear a hundred battles. Let's go right away! We'll go for as long as time allows! {\an8}"Akihabara Purchase-Only" There! Moé, moé! Kyun! Excuse me! Welcome home, Master. Clang, clang, clang, clang... --Clang, clang, clang... --Clang, clang, clang... {\an8}"Illustrated by Henreader" "Please watch again!"
