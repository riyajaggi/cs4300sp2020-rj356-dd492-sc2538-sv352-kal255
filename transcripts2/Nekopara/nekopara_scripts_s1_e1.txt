 Chocola, wake up. It's morning. Chocola... Chocola. Mm... Master... Please don't over-trim Chocola's nails... Hey! That tickles! This is a breast-kneading motion-- part of our instinct as cats. Wait, but you were kneading Chocola's stomach. Hmm... Good point. Oh, you're finally awake. Good morning, Master! Morning, Master. Yes, good morning. Hey, what's for breakfast? We're having bacon and eggs today.

 Wow! Chocola loves bacon and eggs! Go wash your face, then it's breakfast time. Yes. Chocola, that's not what he meant. Let's eat! Mm, delicious! Vanilla, we have to admit, Master's cooking is the best! Chocola, don't talk while eating. You just launched something. Cats grow so quickly... When we found them back home, they couldn't even use chopsticks properly. Now they're able to help me in my shop. I still remember what a surprise it was to see them here, though. {\an8}"Danger! Fragile! This side definitely up!" "Danger! Fragile! Throw this box and we will shut your business down!" What are these massive boxes...? They look like stuff from home, but... I guess I'll find out if I open them-- {\an8}Ah-choo! Now that I think about it, to be safe, I shouldn't open boxes I don't recognize. The movers must have made a mistake. I'll just send them back. I should call them right away. Don't do that! Um... Hello, l-long time no see, Master? I just saw you back home yesterday. So the other box must be... Wherever Chocola is, that's where I am. This must be Shigure's doing. N-No! When you decided to start your shop and live alone, I didn't talk to Shigure- chan . I really wanted to stay with you, so she didn't come up with a plan. I didn't hide inside your things so that I could just show up and live with you! Chocola, you just confessed to everything. First things first, just get out of there. We can discuss more after that. Since I ended up letting them stay here, I guess I have to admit I'm soft on cats. Master. If you're not eating those bacon and eggs, Chocola will... No. Yes. He is giving those to me. Why? What's up, Shigure? Oh, nothing... You've gotten quite good at that. Yeah, I cook breakfast every other day. Naturally, I'd get a bit better. Right... Sure. So... is there anything for me to help with? Don't worry about it. Remember how we set up a schedule to have us cats make breakfast? Yes, you're right, but... Why don't you give Nuts there a hand? Um... What's Coconut doing? I'm making sure the rice cooker doesn't mess up the rice! Huh...? You know how dangerous it is to give Coconut a knife, right? Brace yourself, fish! Right... That's why I gave her a safe assignment. I-I see... Hey May-chan, aren't you done yet? Aren't you coming out? You have to hurry, or else I... I... Fine, I heard you! I'm coming out, don't rush me! If you don't come out soon, I'm going to let it out... Cinnamon is like this every morning. Did Shigure mess up her toilet training? Wow, looks delicious! Azuki worked very hard today. I helped, too! Yes, you did. Let's eat. Let's eat! Let's eat! Our cats are so energetic, as always. I hope Chocola and Vanilla are doing well at dear brother's? Good. Looks like the shop is ready to open. All ready! Nothing missed. Okay, let's begin. I'm counting on you two, as usual! Yes! {\an8}Leave it to me. Good, all done. They say sleeping children grow fast, but does she really want to get even bigger? Ouch! What was that for?! Sorry, I just couldn't hold back. Oh, what, you want some? Come on, May-chan, hurry. I know. Azuki and Coconut are at it again... May-chan, what are you doing?! Hurry! We're already late because you said you wanted to change your panties before we left! That's because you wouldn't come out of the bathroom, so I let a bit out-- A-Anyway, let's hurry! Hey, Mom. Look--cats. Oh, yes, you're right. Leaving their house with their bells, how impressive. Bells? Can they leave their houses if they wear a bell? Yes, that's right. Cats aren't allowed to leave their houses unless their masters are with them. But they can, if they're wearing a bell. I see. But they have to pass a difficult test to get a bell, it's very tough. So those cats must be, like, really smart! Bye-bye! Let's hurry! We'll be late! Maple and Cinnamon are late! If they don't come soon, Chocola will get dizzy with a grumbling hungry stomach! Trying to hide her stomach rumble... Chocola, so cute. Wow, what a cute shop! I know right? Welcome! This way, please! Four limited-edition melting puddings, comes out to 1,555 yen. That other one was cute, too, but that white cat is super cute! This shop is so relaxing. Thank you for waiting! Here is your in-season fruits tart. Wow, looks delicious! Um... Hello? Do you... want a bite? Are you sure?! Sure, why not? Here, open wide... My apologies. Unfortunately, we don't allow our customers to feed our employees. O-Oh, is that so... Maple and Cinnamon are so late... {\pos(867,426)}"Changing" Come on--hurry, hurry! I know! Good. Yes, perfect. Sorry! We're late! Oh, there you are. Please relieve the other two. I'm afraid Chocola is about to pounce on a customer's cake. Welcome to the patisserie "La Soleil." Two guests, this way please. Here is your seat. Open wide. Oh, I like that. Open wide. Oh, if she did that, I-I would... ...get so damp! We're so sorry we were late today. No problem. It was only like ten minutes anyway. That is a problem! Chocola was about to fall unconscious from hunger! Sorry! It's okay to be a little late. It's so great to get your help. Chocola also forgives you, taking a hint from Master's kindness! Thanks. Oh... I almost forgot. I put some seared tuna in the upstairs fridge. It's for your dinner. Tuna! Shigure gave it to us. She got hold of some fresh tuna, and wanted her dear brother and his cats to enjoy it. Oh, I can't wait! It's so delicious! Yes. Yeah, especially with some ponzu vinegar, my face would melt... Oh! What's wrong? I forgot, she asked us to take some ponzu as well. You have ponzu here, don't you? No, I don't think I do... It's fine, we'll just use soy sauce. What? But... it's such delicious tuna... In that case, Chocola will run out and go buy some! Chocola will be super fast, so please wait for Chocola. Don't start without Chocola! Oh, hey... Chocola is so full of energy, as always. I really envy her unlimited stamina. I should shower her with compliments when she gets back. Master. I can be in charge of that. Uh, okay... {\an8}♪ Ponzu, ponzu, ponzu for delicious tuna! ♪ Oh, I know. Shortcut! When Chocola gets back, Master will surely shower Chocola with praise! Then he might play with Chocola using some new toys, and perhaps Vanilla can groom Chocola's hair after our bath! All right, speed up! {\an8}♪ Ponzu, ponzu, ponzu for delicious tuna... ♪ Hey, you there... What are you doing all alone? Where is your master? Uh, u-um... Hey, where is your house? Do you live nearby? Oh, are you hungry? Um, did Chocola have something with her? I might... Over here... Got it! There! Colorful chocolates that Chocola got for snacks the other day! Wait, what?! Hey! What's wrong? Hmm...? What got into her...? If Chocola leaves this here, that girl can eat it by the time Chocola gets back. Wait, what was Chocola doing out here in the first place? Oh, right! Ponzu! Vanilla and the Master are waiting! --Master. --No. I haven't said anything yet. If you had a quick bite with some soy sauce, Chocola would hold it against you for the rest of your lives. Ugh... That is quite probable. Hmm...? Oh, she ate the chocolate. I wonder if she was waiting for her master to come pick her up? That's probably it. Otherwise, why would a bell-less cat be out here alone? {\an8}♪ Ponzu, ponzu, ponzu for delicious tuna! ♪ I'm home! Hmm? Huh? {\pos(1482,954)}"Illustration by Takahiro Tsurusaki"
