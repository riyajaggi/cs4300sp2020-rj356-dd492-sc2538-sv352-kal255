 (speaking indistinctly) Consul general. Mr. McGarrett. Do you recognize this? Yes, it is ours. What are her chances, doctor? (moans) Did it have anything to do with this? Can you tell me where you got it? Where it came from? The... The... The... (croaks) Ways of... love. The... Ways... of...

 love. ( fast, mysterious theme playing) ( upbeat surf theme playing) ( mysterious, somber theme playing) Are you certain you never saw her before? I do not believe so, but only a fool or an extremely wise man is ever certain of anything, Mr. McGarrett. I wish I could be certain that with this tragic occurrence, you will be able to recover those jewels. We may have more to go on. But it has already taken eight days. And if it were not for this poor woman's bad luck, you would not have any more to go on. Some of our best work is luck. Mr. McGarrett, when your country invited us to exhibit our crown jewels here in Hawaii, we were assured that they would be safe. You cannot blame our people for being unhappy about this situation. We haven't exactly been overjoyed, sir. Now maybe we have a chance. So this is the first trouble, as far as you know, that Celeste Caro ever had? The very first time, Mr. Williams. She was always a very quiet girl. A very nice girl. Busy with her art and things like that. When I heard the noise coming from her place, and her screaming, well, I called the police and then I came out here to wait for them. And then what happened? Well, the man must have heard the sirens, because he dragged Celeste out here, right where we're standing, and then to his car. It was... Was parked right down there. Did you see what kind it was? Oh, I was too upset to notice. It was a... A wha... A... A green sedan of some kind. Fine. Go ahead. Well, after he drove off, the police arrived. And I told them what had happened, and, well, they just took right off after him. Have you ever seen the man before? Once or twice. A blond man. Oh, Mr. Williams, this is a terrible thing. Terrible thing. She always seemed such a sweet, nice girl. If you'll excuse me a minute, Mrs. Davis, I'll be right back. How we doing, Danno? Kono and H.P.D. are inside. I've been checking with the neighbors, but, uh, so far, not much. Stay with it, we're in trouble. Kemo. Some mess, huh? Whoever was looking was sloppy. Here's something interesting. "Dear Dave: The ways of love are strange. The vows of love." Familiar. What? Nothing. And this. "Dave Barca, Box 2469, Solario County, California." Name mean anything to you? Nothing. Run a make on it. Will do. ( soft, mournful theme playing) Nice-looking girl, huh, boss? What do you got? Unexposed x-ray film, odd size. Industrial. Dust it, find out what you can about it. It's getting rough outside, Steve. I'm a cop. I'm used to it. But there are millions of dollars in stolen jewelry involved here. Diplomatic pressures. I'm getting pressure right now from Washington. And you've gotta get me some answers. Look, Walter, we're working on it. It takes time. Haven't any of your leads paid off? What a... What about the green sedan? Stolen. No pickup yet. Fingerprints? (intercom buzzes) Plenty of the girl's. Yeah. Yeah, send him in. A few strange latents, no make on them yet. (latch clicks) Morning, sir. Steve, that, uh, "ways of love" note the girl wrote to a Dave Barca, Post Office Box 2469, Solario County, California. That's the county jail there. Inmate? Right. Barca's in the holding section right now waiting for a hearing on fugitive charges. Guess where he was picked up? Honolulu. Two days after the jewel robbery. Got him on a California warrant, charging parole violation. He's been serving term in San Quentin for, uh, felonious assault. He could have been here when the jewelry was stolen. Funny thing is, he, uh, got busted for passing a red light. Didn't have a driver's license. I see he served time for forgery. Jumped bail seven months ago. He's a loser. Whose car was he driving? Celeste Caro's. What was he doing in Honolulu? According to him, vacation. Other than that, he didn't say ten words the whole time they had him. Check with H.P.D. Run him up, down and backwards. I wanna know everything about him. Right. You wanna go to the mainland and question Barca? No, that's no good. If he clams up the way he did here in Honolulu, we've blown our best chance. There's got to be something we can do. There is. If Washington claims this case is important, maybe they can pull a few strings. ( tense, mysterious theme playing) GUARD: Got some company for you, Barca. Hi, pal. Name's Crowley, Steve Crowley. What's yours? Anderson. Annely. Abrams. This ain't any different than the lousy Air Force jail I just got out of. Ever been in the service, pal? GUARD: Henderson. Oh, got a new one, huh? What's your name? Crowley. Anything you want. Candy, butts, I can get it for you, Crowley. Good, I'll keep it in mind. What are you in for? (pops) Armed robbery. (chuckles) You got problems, Crowley. Where's my letter? GUARD: A letter? Oh, yeah. Well, there, uh... There don't seem to be... Wait a second. Oh, no, that isn't you. Sorry, Barca, no letter. Maybe tomorrow. Danny. Hi, Chin. Hi. Hi, Jim. Who found it? A couple of scuba divers. DANNY: There's no question about it, this is the car Celeste Caro was in. DANNY: Some kind of x-ray stuff. Now we know where those plates came from. So my girl says, "Why don't you grab one of them free Air Force flights you're always talking about? Come on out, we'll have a big weekend." So... vrrrm! I fly west 2000 miles, and what do you think I find when I get there? An empty apartment, a bottle of booze and a refrigerator full of beer. So I wait, and I wait, and I wait. Nothing happens. Then I start on the boilermakers. Boom-boom, boom-boom, boom-boom. Next thing you know, I wake up, I'm under arrest. (chuckles) What can I pull for a rap like that, pal? You're the friendly type, ain't you, pal? (laughs) This tooth is killing me. Hey, guard. Guard! What is it, Crowley? I got a toothache. Wanna see the dentist. I'll, uh, put in a slip. What's with the slip? Come on, Crowley, be brave. Oh, a comedian, huh? A comedian. Look, pal, come off it, huh? We might be cooped up in this cage a long time here. No sense in dummying up. Shut up, Crowley. I don't wanna talk. I don't wanna listen. So just shut up. Ooh, what a burn. What a burn. Those things make sense to you? Not much. But Jimmy here says what we've got is some kind of high-energy portable x-ray machine. Don't mean nothing to me. Looks similar to some of the equipment they have in steel-fabricating plants to check out the strength of their steel plates. Think there could be enough energy to penetrate a half-foot of steel? Could be theoretically possible, if they have a powerful enough source. Could they carry it with them? Pickup truck could carry it. So you build one and you look through a half a foot of steel. Where does it lead? Very possibly to, uh, several million dollars worth of jewelry. (light rock music playing) NEWSCASTER: Display ever of military might, a government spokesman declared that this martial array was for the sole purpose of preserving peace within the confines of his own country, and to prevent aggression from any neighboring sovereign nations. In this afternoon's feature race at Santa Anita, Lucky Lou is favored by most handicappers. And now in 30 seconds, we'll open the crime file. Today's headline story is from Honolulu, where police have definitely linked the death of a young, beautiful girl by the name of Celeste Caro with the crown-jewel robbery that stunned the islands last week. But first, a thirty-second word from one of our sponsors. ( rock music playing) Give me that radio. Where is she? What are you talking about, you gone ape? Shut up! NEWSCASTER: The 25-year-old artist named Celeste Caro was brutally beaten and abducted from her Oahu apartment last week by an unknown assailant. He's described as six feet tall, fair-haired, and about 30 years old. He eluded police in a hundred-mile-an-hour chase. The girl fell or was pushed out onto the road. Police found she was wearing a diamond earring that was part of a huge jewelry haul from a foreign consulate. Promise further developments in the case within a matter of hours. Now your afternoon sports digest. In this afternoon's feature race... Give me that radio back. What's the matter with you? Lucky Lou is favored by most handicappers. You gone sick or something, pal? You sick? But experts don't believe that she can now... ( rock music playing) GUARD: Crowley? I told you I'd take care of you. That dentist'll take a look at your tooth now. Well, what do you know? Your cell is here. When they take you to the courtroom, they'll move you down this way. What's the security here? Usually there's a guard at either end. We could cut down on the number of men, however... No, no, no, no. Everything normal. Nothing different. I don't want any suspicion on his part. Well, then the way I see it, your best bet would be right here. Yeah, that'll work. ( tense, ominous theme playing) You're planning a break, right? You're talking, not me. Sure. Sure, sure you are. But you can't make it solo. (chuckles) You're gonna need my help. (laughs) Funny man. I'm telling you, you need me. Listen, Crowley, that thing can get us out of here. Us? Us? Why should I cut you in? I got it made. How? How? Look, pal, you know the ropes around here. You're so smart. Okay, from now on you make it solo. I'm due in court tomorrow and I'm leaving. I'm due in court tomorrow too. Then I'll wave goodbye. No, you won't, Crowley. I'm going with you. Got me? Going with you. You say no, I'll guarantee you'll never make it to the street. (chuckles) You're the only one who knows the combination? Right, but this safe's a lot smaller than the one the jewels were taken from. The principle's the same, it's just a matter of power. The x-ray components we found in the car are from a unit with enough power to penetrate the safe at the consulate. Would you step into the next room, gentlemen? I'm ready. You're safe as long as you stay where you are. He took quite a chance. Whoever did it knew enough to protect themselves. (buzzes) Well, all we have to do now is wait for it to be developed. We got a good picture. The tumbler notches are very clear. You're no longer the only one who knows the combination. Well, now we can tell the consul general how it was done. But the only thing that'll impress him is when we put the jewels back in his hand. I'm with him, sir. But, uh, one step at a time. Come on. That way. ( slow, ominous theme playing) (grunts) Wait a minute. Take it easy. ( tense, suspenseful theme playing) (lock rattles) ( fast, tense theme playing) (gunshots) Good shooting. Connie. Hey, Connie. Connie. You sure the cops don't know about your girl? How would they know? I wouldn't tell them. (laughs) Where do you think she is? Out with some guy, maybe. Who cares? She left the key, didn't she, pal? Hey, Connie. Hey, Connie, baby. Connie. What are you doing? I was hoping I'd stashed a few clams. I had over 200 bucks when I landed at the air base here. I know because it was payday and the flight was free. What do you mean, free? Air Force flight, pal. Military personnel don't pay. That's gotta be the one good thing about the service. You can get around plenty if you want to. How does it work? Oh, what difference does it make now? Look, there's someplace I gotta go and go fast. How does it work? Okay, okay. Get your leave orders, right? You take 'em to an Air Force base and ask 'em for the first flight going your way. They got room... Baroom! They take you. Where do they take you? Any place they fly, pal. What difference it make? You're not going anywhere with them. ( brooding, ominous theme playing) Here, get a suntan. ( light surf theme playing) Morning, sir. Morning. Who is it, Chin? Maybe the rest of our x-ray puzzle. The body's been identified. Jack Wade. Ran Technological X-Ray Service, industrial work. I tell you, Crowley, we can do it. We can do it. We got two uniforms. The Air Force has got planes. All we gotta do is stay cool until tonight. Yeah. Then what? Then we go to Hawaii. Hawaii? It's perfect. The police'll be watching every airport, railway station and bus terminal in the area. But they won't be watching military air fields. Why Hawaii? (laughs) Do you like to surf? I'll fill you in on that later. It's not that easy to get to Hawaii, pal. What's hard? You said those planes fly all over. Yeah, but you gotta catch a M.A.C. flight. A what? M.A.C., M.A.C. Military Airlift Command. So? So they only leave from Travis. Travis is only 25 miles away from here. What are you gonna do, walk? (laughs) We borrow a car and ditch it just before we get to the airbase. No, no, no. Forget it. Forget it. ( slow, tense theme playing) I'll make you rich. That's pretty big talk for a... piggy bank robber, huh? I know it's hard for you to think, but, uh, give it a try, okay? Okay, pal. You stay here or head east, they'll get you sure. But Hawaii's the one place they won't be looking, because how are you gonna get there? Make sense? Yeah. You coming with me? Sure. Sure, why not? Hawaii, huh? You'll find something out about me, Crowley. I don't ask favors. You're gonna make out all right. Yeah, they're only mimeographed. What are you talking about? These are the orders I had before the cops picked me up. They're mimeoed on plain paper. So what? So... Tonight we break into an office somewhere, we mimeo ourselves a couple of sets of orders, and... Baroom! Off to Hawaii. Yeah, no name. 3246 Howard. Can't make out the phone number. Got it. Jack Wade, one conviction on a medical bunco rap. Went straight after that. What is it? He served a one-to-ten for preparing fake x-ray plates used to defraud insurance companies on false medical claims. He had a partner in that little racket. Clipped the guy's rap sheet and mug shot together with Wade's. DANNY: Dan Larsen. Hundred and sixty-five pounds, 5-feet-10. Male, Caucasian. Hair, blond. Maybe our guy. Yeah, maybe. Let's see. Yeah, he's in here. Can you make out the address? The salt water didn't help. With a little luck in the lab, maybe. ( slow, suspenseful theme playing) ( tense, suspenseful theme playing) Danny, we got him. DANNY: Let's have it. Larsen just went into his place. Do we take him? No, not yet. Let's wait till we hear from Steve. Just stay with him. Okay. ( tense, suspenseful theme playing) How do you like them apples? Harold Miller, U.S.A.F. He likes to sign with a flourish. ( upbeat, stealthy music playing) It's gotta be Larsen. Only three of us were in on it. Celeste, me and Larsen. He killed her, took the jewelry. You gotta get him. Ho! Why me, pal? I'm too hot in this town. Get him and we'll sweat him. I think you're using me for some kind of patsy. I'm offering you 25 grand. Where else can you make that kind of money? What do you think he's gonna do, just trot along with me? This may help persuade him. Yeah, yeah. It's groovy. (laughs) ( slow, tense theme playing) That's the place, Steve. His girl with him now? No. She works as a cashier in a restaurant downtown. What else have you got on Larsen? In the British navy for 12 years. Discharged two years ago for the convenience of the government. Military specialty, x-ray technician. It figures. (knocking) Who is it? (slurs): I wanna see Evy. She's not here. (knocking) I wanna see Evy. Go on, sleep it off, will you? Come on. Open up. Look, I told you... Hey, what do you want? I'm a friend of Dave Barca's. (laughs) Barca? I don't know any Barca. Well, he knows you, and he's out and he wants to talk to you. What does he want with me? His cut. Where is he? He's in town. Look, you just tell him I don't know where the stuff is, all right? You tell him. (screaming) Dave, I didn't kill her. She threw herself out of the car, Dave. And you were just on a little joy ride, right? Dave, listen to me. Listen, listen. She took the stuff from the boat, not me. She stashed it away, not me, Dave. Dave, she was nothing but a conniving little drab. No! No, Dave. No, stop. No. Please stop. No! (grunts) (moaning and choking) No! No, no. Don't... (sobs) Wait a minute. Wait a minute, pal. You'll kill him, and you need him. Where is it? She didn't tell me, Dave. You beat it out of her and you threw her out of the car. No, Dave. No. I swear it, no. She did us all. She hid the stuff and then she died, and it's gone, Dave. It's gone! Celeste wouldn't double-cross me. She grabbed the stuff right after you were arrested. It was her big chance, Dave. She took it. She didn't double-cross me! Wait a minute. Maybe he's right. This Celeste dame, what's her name? Where does she live? What's the difference? Well, maybe the stuff is at her place. He was there, he didn't find it. Hey, wait a minute. Someone called the cops. I had to scamper. I didn't get a chance to look, Dave. What we got to lose, mate? Come on. You got a car? (laughs) We can use me girl's. Hey. ( fast, ominous theme playing) ( mournful, romantic theme playing) Not bad. How long did you know her? Six months. Good months, I thought. Tough luck, pal. "Dear Dave: "The ways of love are strange." "The vows of love." The vows. She didn't double-cross me. Oh, that was bright, pal. That was bright. Everybody on the street heard that shot. Why did he kill her? He di... He didn't have to. Why did he kill her? Let's get out of here. Let 'em get away. Let's go. No, let Steve ride it out. It's the plan. Larsen's alive. I'll get an ambulance. ( fast, tense theme playing) Well, you've done it, pal. You've done it. You've hung a murder rap on us. We've lost them. Are you kidding? Every cop in Hawaii must be looking for us. I think I know where it is now. Look, pal, if you know where that stuff is, let's get it and get off this rock, huh? Follow this road. (tires screeching) Stay here. Wait a minute, pal. You're not gonna ace me out... I said, stay here. I've been away, sensei. Have you seen the girl since we were here together? She left something here. She said in case you return and she was unable to meet you. She couldn't make it. But I'll pick up what she left. Of course, if you will excuse me. Stand still, Barca. ( soft, melancholy theme playing) Get an ambulance. Hawaii State Police. (laughs) You see, the shrine, the vows of love... She did love me. Yeah. Easy. (laughs) ( upbeat surf theme playing) OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
