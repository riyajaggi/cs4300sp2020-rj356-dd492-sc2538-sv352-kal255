 WOMAN (on PA): Passengers arriving on Flight 14 may now claim their luggage at the baggage-claim area. Announcing the departure of Mainliner Flight 190 for Los Angeles and Chicago, now ready for boarding at Gate 9. Hey there, commissioner. You been to mainland? That's okay, I'll take it for you. Mahalo. Thank you very much. No worry. Us Hawaiians gotta stick together, you know. Commissioner, you forgot this one.

 Okay. Where to, brother? Driver, there's been a mistake. Will you take it back to the baggage counter? (crowd screaming) ( ominous theme playing) Get back! Get back! ( upbeat surf theme playing) ( ominous theme playing) What have we got? Homicide. Land Commissioner Manu. Manu? This guy here placed the commissioner's bag in the cab and then "boom."

 But I just... Just put it inside the cab, and I went away, and... And then "pow." DANNY: Steve? This is Steve McGarrett, Five-0, state police. This is Miss Grace Willis. She thinks she saw the man. Go ahead, Miss Willis. Well, I was taking movies, and I... I saw this young man hurry by with a small leather case. He put it in the taxi and... And then hurried away, I... He went right past me. Then I saw the explosion. It was terrible. Can you describe the man? Yeah, he was young and handsome, and... Hawaiian. I got a picture of him with this. It's the last shot. Freeze it. How old would you say, Danno? Twenty-two, three? Smart boy to make a bomb like that. Smart? I'd call that one dumb Hawaiian. High-school graduate maybe? Maybe. Check it out. I'll have some wet prints run off right away. We'll try for an identification through the mug books first, then we'll distribute his picture through channels. Thanks, lieutenant. I'll go with him. (phone buzzes) Yeah, love? Tell His Excellency I'm on my way. It just doesn't make sense, Steve. It doesn't make sense. There's no reason on earth why anyone should want to murder Nathan Manu. Well, obviously, someone did. A warm, gentle human being. A man who devoted his life to the welfare of these islands and their people. When I appointed him land commissioner, he even refused his salary. Worked for a dollar a year. I received this from Nathan yesterday. "Arriving Flight 623, Saturday morning. Important I meet with you on urgent matter." Was the commissioner expected back this morning? No. As a matter of fact, he cut his San Diego trip short a few days. What was he doing in San Diego? Oh, I don't know. Attending some sort of convention or something. Any, uh, idea about this urgent meeting? No. Have you showed this to anyone? No one, not even my secretary. It was left on my desk, unopened. You got something? Maybe. Doesn't it seem strange that nobody was at the airport to meet him? Nobody from his staff, not even his wife? You mean, I was the only one who knew he was on that plane? So far. You and a Hawaiian boy. Steve, not only was Nathan Manu one of Hawaii's finest citizens, he was also a close, personal friend. I want you to pull out all the stops on this one. Find that boy. Yes, sir. Two requests to appear on newscast... Nope. Concerning commissioner... Danny and Kono have gone to H.P.D. Chin Ho's getting the last of the information on Commissioner Manu. Good. One more thing. Brunch. Thanks, love. Okay. Aloha. Here's the bag on Commissioner Manu from the day he took office. What was the hang-up? Simple red tape. Plus today is Saturday. Land commissioner important man, gets lots of pressures. You looking for a graft angle? Right now, I'm looking for anything. DANNY: Steve? The blowups just came in on that Hawaiian boy. They're still wet. Hm. Check with the San Diego Police. See if they come up with anything on Commissioner Manu while he was there. Then, I wanna know about the bomb, what it was made of and how it was triggered. ( slow horn theme playing) No, I've never seen him before. Are you sure, Mrs. Manu? Yes. It's strange, he has that pure Hawaiian face that Nate admired so much. The kind of a boy that Nate would have done anything to help. I'm sorry to trouble you at a time like this. I just have a few more questions. Did your husband telephone or write to you while he was away? Yes. The last time I spoke to him was a few days ago. Would you care to tell me the nature of the call? No, I would not. It was private and personal. Did you know your husband was returning early? No, I... I wasn't expecting him back until Monday. Have you any idea why he came back early? (fence clinking) I'm sorry, Kiana. Mr. McGarrett, this is Nate's best friend, Benny Kalua, and his daughter, Leilani. How do you do? Is there anything we can do? No, thank you. I, uh, think maybe I'll go into the house and rest a while. Thank you, Mrs. Manu. I... I won't impose on you anymore now. I'll help you. It's a terrible thing. Any idea who did it? We're making some headway. You find whoever killed Nate, Mr. McGarrett. You find him. And when you do, don't arrest him. Don't put him in jail. You pin a medal on him, Mr. McGarrett. ( suspenseful theme playing) I'm a cop, Mr. Kalua. I'm looking for answers. I never heard a statement like that from a friend. Why do you think Commissioner Manu's killer should get a medal? Look, McGarrett, down there. Hotels, beaches, shops, tourists, glamour. Money. Nate and I were born right there in Waikiki. When we were kids, there were a lot of Hawaiians there. Most of the places where the hotels are now, that was a big swamp with ducks. Nate and I played there, chasing the ducks and laughing all over the place. Kids. That was the Nate I loved. He was like my brother. Who was the Nate you hate enough to wanna pin a medal on his murderer? There's an old Hawaiian saying, McGarrett: "And one day, we shall be strangers in our own land." Nate loved the land until a few years ago. Then he changed. All of a sudden, he was all for those high-rise buildings and housing projects, condominiums, freeways. Never mind the Hawaiian and the land. Build the lousy cement and steel all the way up into the sky. Block out the sky and the mountains. Nate was all for that. He called that "progress." That side of Nate I hated. The funny thing is... I wanna go to that place where he's laying. I wanna go to my best friend. I wanna yell at him: "You turned against your people... "against the land, like a traitor." And at the same time, I... I wanna grab him in my arms, and I wanna say his name over and over. "Nate..." Nate. My friend, Nate." (sighs) Could a Hawaiian have hated him enough to wanna kill him, Benny. Because he thought he betrayed the land? You think a Hawaiian did it? Well, we think this boy... might have. You ever see him before? No. Did you know that Commissioner Manu was coming back this morning? No. While he was away, did you talk to him? Did he try to contact you? No. (phone rings) McGarrett. Steve? Danny. Better get back to the palace on the double. A fellow named Lester Willighby came in a few minutes ago. He just confessed to the murder of Commissioner Manu. ( dramatic theme playing) McGARRETT: What'd you say your name was? (sighs) My name is Lester Willighby, and that's all you're gonna get out of me unless you promise me some protection. Nothing's gonna happen to you here, Mr. Willighby. Mr. Williams apprised you of your constitutional rights? Yeah, yeah, he told me. I just wanna get it out of my system, so let's go. You killed Nathan Manu? That's right. Why? The mainland mob gave me a contract to make the hit. Well, that's right. I'm an enforcer. (chuckles): What's the matter, Mr. McGarrett? Don't you think it could be me? Or do you cops around here think mainland gunmen run around looking like B-movie gangsters or something, huh? What did the mob have against Commissioner Manu? Gambling markers, 75 grand worth. There's no word here about Manu's being a heavy gambler. Well, not here. On the mainland. Do you think he made all those trips for local business? Okay, we got 75,000 in markers. Go ahead. Well, he wouldn't pay off, so they gave me the contract. Now look, aren't you getting some reporters to hear this? There's no sense in me going over this more than once, you know. We'll still need a few more details, Mr. Willighby. Like what? Like how you made the hit. Well, it was easy. I got to the airport at 6:45, I was waiting when his plane came in at 7:30. He got into the cab, and I threw my little package in after him, and he was written off. (snaps fingers) Just like that? Just like that. (snaps) You see? I'm a real pro. Where'd you get the explosive? Well, in my business that's no problem. What is your problem? What? You, uh, made your hit, you got away. What are you doing here? Protection. From what? The double cross. Spell it out. Well, I have a local contact here. He told me there was a contract out on me. I'd be dead before I got off the island. That doesn't make sense. Well, to the mob it does. Enforce the enforcer, double up the trail. Make it twice as tough to get a lead back to them. Do you get it? You'd rather be in jail, huh? (laughs) That 20 years to life... is a lot better than being dead, you know? Let me get something straight, Mr. Willighby. When Manu got in his cab, you dropped the explosive in after him? That's right. Any reason why you carried it in a brown paper bag? Why not? Anybody who noticed might think I was carrying my lunch. How'd you get his wife out of the car? Huh? DANNY: Mrs. Manu. She was in the cab with him. Of course she was. Then why wasn't she killed? Like you said, I got her out of the way. How? Well, what difference does it make? How? How, Mr. Willighby? A trick. I got the baggage man to bring her a message. And she went to the phone? That's right. According to our reports, she went to the dispatch room. Well, maybe she did. Why would she go there if she had a phone call? Well, how do I know? Maybe she was confused or something. What difference does it make? I got her out of the way, and I killed Manu, and that's all you wanna know, isn't it? Take him to Queen's Hospital, Psychiatric Ward. What? What are you talking about? The explosive wasn't in a brown paper bag. And Mrs. Manu wasn't at the airport. No. Y-you think I'm lying. I-I'm not lying. The stuff was in the brown paper bag. Mrs. Manu was there, and I got her out of the way, and I killed Manu. I'm not lying! I was there at 6:45, and that plane came in at... At 7:30, and I killed Manu! I threw it right in the car! I'm not lying! What makes you think I'm lying? I'm not! I'm not a liar! You didn't kill Commissioner Manu any more than I did. (sobs) How long you been in the islands? (sniffles) Six months. Any relatives here? Any friends? No. Tell us what you really do. I was a bookkeeper for a department store. Thirty years I work for them. Thirty years doing the same thing, day in and day out. A machine. I was just like a machine, that's all. Nobody noticed, nobody cared. I thought I could find a new life out here. I though things might somehow be different. You know, more glamorous. Well, they weren't. (scoffs): They were just the same, and I was still... a bookkeeper. Come on, Mr. Willighby. ( plaintive theme playing) Eh. For once in my life... I wanted people to notice me. I wanted them to know who Lester Willighby was. You understand? Yeah. (door closes) Just got a call from Chin Ho. He got a make on that Tommy Kapali boy from his high school. Got an address? Thanks a lot. ( suspenseful theme playing) One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten... That's the house, Steve. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. Here I come, ready or not. Don't be frightened. McGarrett, Five-0. Oh, wait! You policeman? Yes, ma'am. (gun cocks) Call H.P.D., report our findings. See if anything turned up there for us, hm? Okay, Steve. Please, what you want? Please, sit down, won't you? I'd like to talk to you. Talk to me? About what? You're Mrs. Kapali, aren't you? Ay. You have a son named Tommy? What about Tommy? He in trouble? What makes you think he's in trouble, Mrs. Kapali? Well, I think he... Nothing to be afraid of. If Tommy hasn't done anything wrong, there won't be any trouble. Where is your son? I don't know. Well, you must have some idea where he is. You're his mother, aren't you? I no see Tommy maybe one year now. Why you wanna find him? I wanna ask him a couple of questions. Now, would you like to tell me where he is? (sighs) This is Tommy, isn't it? Yes. Tommy's a good boy and a good soldier. So you leave him alone, eh? You no bother my boy. You're frightened about something, Mrs. Kapali. Is it about Tommy? Why don't you tell me about him? Oh. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know! Of course you do. And we're gonna find out what's troubling you anyway. No, no. Mrs. Kapali, we have to talk to him. Now, we don't wanna hurt him, and you don't wanna hurt him... but we have to talk to him. Will you please tell me where he is? ( melancholy theme playing) Tommy, he's been sick. He's sick in the head long time now. But he's better now, honest. He's better now. If Tommy hasn't done anything wrong, he's got nothing to worry about. But if he's sick, give us a chance to help him. Tommy, he work on big construction job by Pearl City. Uh, boss man name, uh, Mr. Milner. Thank you, Mrs. Kapali. Mister. Please, you no hurt my Tommy. You make promise. Please, no hurt him. We'll try not to. I'm going out to Pearl City. Have Kono check Tommy Kapali's Army record. Find out if he worked with ordnance, demolition, any place where he might have handled explosives, huh? You the foreman around here? Construction boss. Sorry. McGarrett, Five-0. What is your name, sir? Saunders. Hey, you! You're grading the wrong spot, stupid! I'd like to talk to you. I'm busy! I'm busy too, mister. Where's Tommy Kapali? What do you wanna know about him for? Look, why don't you save time for both of us? Where is he? Couldn't tell you. Why not? Fired him a couple of weeks ago. Why did you fire him? Well, he's always shooting his mouth off. A real troublemaker. Got an address on him? Check with our downtown office. Are you Mr. Milner? Yes. McGarrett, Five-0. Oh, thanks for coming by, McGarrett. Saunders called as I was leaving the office. I've got that information on the Kapali kid. And also, I wanted to talk to you. I'm listening. Well, I just want you to know that if there's anything I can do, personally, to help... Oh, you have a personal interest in this? Yes, I do. You see, McGarrett, I knew Nathan Manu. He was a fine man, a man with vision. Then to be murdered by a boy like that. A boy like what? Well, this Tommy Kapali you're looking for. We're not sure Tommy Kapali murdered Commissioner Manu. Why are you? Saunders told me he was always shooting off his mouth to the other workmen. Telling them we were destroying the land, not building it. You know, he even claimed the land belonged to them. I've run into his kind before. Maybe he just meant that the land belonged to them as native Hawaiians, huh? I know, I know, I've heard all that. You know, you've gotta stop treating these Hawaiians like children. You've got to use the land, make it work for them. Provide them with jobs. Jobs, McGarrett. You're pretty uptight about this, aren't you? Yeah, well, I've never seen a race of people die out anywhere when they had good jobs or money in the bank. Nathan Manu knew that. Maybe Tommy Kapali didn't. Kapali's address. (jazz music playing on radio in house) Get the back. ( dramatic theme playing) ( tense theme playing) The dynamite was taped here. A hand grenade was used as a trigger. There was a wire to pull the pin threaded through the case. (phone buzzes) Yeah. Yeah, send him in right away. No, I can't take that now. Later. Thank you. I just came from the medical examiner. Yeah. He said that the cause of Tommy's death was fractures, first and second cervical vertebrae. Massive hematoma... Wait a minute, wait a minute. Plain language, Chin. Broken neck. Did he say if there were any marks on the body, any contusions or bruises? Any sign of a struggle? No. Time of death? Sometime this morning. Was it a suicide? That's what he thinks. Did he say? No. That doctor drives me up the wall. Thanks, Chin. Sorry, Danno. Go ahead. Now, once he pulled the wire and freed the pin, he had about 14 seconds to give the case to Manu and clear out. That's it. Any idea where he got the grenade? Be a rough job, but I can check the ordnance offices at Schofield and Pearl. Compact, crude, deadly. Open it. Look, McGarrett. I told you, I'm the only one with a key. Open it. How many are missing? Three sticks. KONO: Tommy Kapali's Army record. Go. Served in Vietnam three months: Bomb-disposal Unit. Bomb disposal? He shipped home in December and discharged in March. Section 8: mentally disturbed. No, it's too pat. It's too pat. All the pieces go together. You could put a ribbon around this one and mail it in. Except for one thing. I still don't know what you think you'll find, Steve. Could be we missed something. Set it up again, Chin. Why aren't you buying it, Steve? It all fits. Yeah? And how does a kid like Tommy know that Manu cut his trip short and is returning home early, huh? How did he know that Manu was on that plane? Ready. Go ahead. Slow it down. Can you focus better? Hold it. Hold it. Sharpen it. Now look... That's it. Hold it. Look at the time on this local clock: 4:15. What time did Manu arrive? Seven-thirty a.m. Yeah. Tommy Kapali was used. Somehow, somebody got him down to the airport before this morning and photographed him. Then that lady in the yellow muumuu, uh, Grace Willis, she turns the film over to us, and we go hell-bent looking for Tommy. A patsy. A perfect patsy. Get me the evidence clerk at H.P.D. An emotionally disturbed ex-GI, a bomb-disposal expert, a Hawaiian kid who hates everything Manu stood for. Sergeant, McGarrett. I want a hold put on that camera we picked up at the airport this morning until I get down there. I'm sorry, Mr. McGarrett, a lady already picked it up. How long ago? About 3:00. Did she sign a receipt? Sure did. Name of, uh, Grace Willis. W-I-L-L-I-S. Phony name, phony address. So far, there's no record of a Grace Willis anywhere in Oahu. The address is an empty lot. H.P.D. is still checking out some possibilities: hotels, utilities, passenger lists. But up to now a blank. What about the receipt for the camera? The crime lab thinks there's a very good possibility there's a latent print on it. Can they bring it up? They're trying. Those special chemicals and equipment, it's gonna be some time before we know. Stay with it, Danno. Yeah. Report from the San Diego Police on Nathan Manu. Anything? Manu stayed at a "La Joll-a" hotel. (chuckles): La Jolla. La Jolla. (chuckles) He also placed four phone calls while he was there, all to his wife. He also received a phone call. From where? Here. I traced the number, public telephone. The rest, you better read for yourself. (phone buzzes) Yeah. Yes, send her in, please. Come in, please. You... You remember me, Mr. McGarrett? Benny Kalua's daughter? Sure, I remember you. Sit down, please. Mr. McGarrett. I read this. He didn't do it, Mr. McGarrett. How do you know that? Tommy wouldn't hurt anybody. He couldn't. You knew Tommy? He was my boyfriend. ( band playing traditional Hawaiian music) (tires screeching) Don't worry, I'll be right out. This way, please. Evening, Mr. McGarrett. Hi. Where's Benny? In his office. Do you want me to tell him you're here? No, don't bother. (door opens) (music stops) (crowd applauding) You lied to me, Benny. Why? About what? You told me you didn't know Tommy Kapali. Leilani tell you? That's right. I ought to book you for withholding evidence. Well, what would you do? Would you drag your daughter into a thing like this? I was only trying to protect her, that's all. Is it? You think I have another reason for not telling you I knew that kid? You tell me. And while you're at it, you better come up with a good reason why I don't book you. Well, go ahead and arrest me, McGarrett. What good will it do you? You have your killer. Tommy Kapali didn't do it. He didn't do it? But the papers said... Somebody went to a lot of trouble to make it look like he did. Who? That's what I'm gonna find out. And when I do, I've got some information for them. Your friend Nathan Manu went to San Diego for a checkup. The test shows that he had cancer. Cancer? Terminal. Whoever pulled that pin on him killed a walking dead man. ( mysterious theme playing) Got any idea who it was, Benny? No. Nate. ( dramatic theme playing) Look, Chin, someplace on this rock there's a woman that we know as Grace Willis. Now, somebody must know her, so find that somebody. Yeah, I'll talk to you later. No haole in any of the mug shots comes close to looking like her. Well, I didn't figure it to come easy. Hey, May? Would you bring us some fresh...? I figured it was about time for some refreshment. Mahalo. Be careful, it's hot. Thanks, love. What would we do without you? (scoffs): One thing for sure. You don't know when it's morning. What's worse... it's Sunday. Does it ever occur to you, Mr. McGarrett, that very few people work on Sunday? Unless you're a cop. Or a cop's secretary. When you're ready for chow, holler. Will do. Okay. Let's take it again from the top, huh? Somebody from here telephoned Nathan Manu in San Diego. Somebody he knew well enough to tell that he was taking an early flight. Who? Milner? Not likely. He's a millionaire because of Manu's views on progress and his land deals. Mrs. Manu? Well, she stands to benefit from his insurance. (phone buzzes) McGarrett. Steve. It's Danny. Yeah, Danno. Got something? I got a make on the Grace Willis print. It matches one on a driver's license issued to an Anne Wilson. I'm on my way there now. On your way where? 122 Kaalawai Place. ( tense theme playing) (woman screaming) ( action theme playing) (woman gasping) Let her go. Halt or I'll shoot! (tires screech) (gunshots) (woman gasping, sobbing) Get on the horn, get an ambulance. Danno?! Danno?! Okay, Steve. (breathing sharply) (groaning) What happened? He used us. He used us all. Who? Who used you? He didn't care. (sobbing): He didn't care about anybody. That poor kid. Tommy Kapali. What about Tommy Kapali? Who didn't care? He... He phoned Commissioner Manu. Who? Who phoned Commissioner Manu? Learned, uh... when he was coming home. He used Tommy, and then he killed him. He used me... and then he tried to have me killed. He told me he loved me. He told me he loved me. Who are you referring to? Please, tell me. He's got a bullet in his chest, but he's still breathing. Who is he? I don't know. He admitted planting the bomb at the airport. He's gonna kill Mr. Milner. He said he was gonna take him up there and bury him. Who is gonna kill Milner? Benny. Benny. Benny Kalua. ( suspenseful theme playing) That's far enough. Nathan died for what he believed in. Are you willing to die for it too... Mr. David Milner? Killing me isn't gonna stop those bulldozers. Not anymore than killing Nathan Manu will stop them. I didn't kill him. You did! You and all the others that are changing this island into a concrete jungle. You're insane. But there'll be a memorial left for you. Here, Four hundred little high-rent boxes. Crawl into your boxes, Hawaiians. Compliments of Mr. David Milner. And you'll stay here, buried beneath them. (grunts) (sirens blaring) (wheels squeaking) Benny! Benny! (sirens blaring) Take cover. Get down! Dynamite! (explosion) Look at that. ( plaintive theme playing) One day, we'll be strangers in our own land.
