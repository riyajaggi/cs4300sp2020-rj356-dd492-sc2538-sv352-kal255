 Shh. (screams) What's going on here? Is this a gag or something? No gag. Inside, sweetheart. Come on! Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Hey! Hey, what's going on? Hey! What are you guys doing? Just drop that. ( dramatic theme playing) (tires screeching) ( upbeat surf theme playing) (siren wailing) (tires screeching) (siren stops) (indistinct chatter) I got so scared, I just went blank. Sure. Now, you girls can go now. What have we got? Armed abduction. Go. Two men in stocking masks came in and took the singer Bobby George, and drove away in his car. Any leads? Nothing yet. But it's a little quick. I sent Kono over to check out the boy's apartment. Lieutenant Jasper has an APB out on the car and Bobby George. Good. (door closes) Hey, you guys ain't gonna close my place, are you? This is Ted Harmon, the manager. Steve McGarrett, Five-0. Mr. Harmon. Hi. This is all I need. I'll be on the phone tomorrow all day looking for a replacement. I hope I have a lot better luck than I had with this one. What's that mean? Well, he didn't draw the crowds. He was a flop. You pay him much? Well, ask him, he'll say peanuts. Ask me, I'm breaking my back. How much? Three bills. Did he, uh, have any money of his own? He didn't spread it around here. Did he gamble or, uh, borrow money? Uh, those are questions cops ask. Me, I wouldn't know. Did he ever ask for a raise or an advance? No, he didn't ask. McGARRETT: How about drugs? Is he a user or a pusher? No, no. I run a clean place. What his private business was, I don't know and I don't care. You don't care? Well, what I mean is, there's lots of kids on the island like Bobby George. One out of 10,000, maybe they got a little extra something. Maybe, uh, one out of 50,000 might be a hit. But a joint like this, they come in, they go out. Me, I keep hoping. Maybe they'll make a hit for me one day. But not Bobby George. Not Bobby George. Why would anyone wanna snatch him? A good question. Steve. Yup. Just got a call from you man, Kono. Said there's somebody in Bobby George's apartment. You may wanna be there before he busts in. Let's go, Danno. ( suspenseful theme playing) Listen... is this a bust? I mean, what's Bobby supposed to have done? We think Bobby George has been kidnapped. (scoffs) You're putting me on. Hardly. WOMAN (scoffs): Man, oh, man. Man, oh, man. Why would anyone wanna kidnap him? (sighs) Hey, like, give me a minute, will you? You gotta be putting me on. It's a gag, right? (chuckles) Bobby sent you. No gag. Did he have any money of his own? Where could he put his hands on enough money to make it worthwhile to a kidnapper? I'm blank. Like, I just blew my mind. Did he have anything of value? Anything they could hold him for? No. Nothing. Steve. Thanks, Danno. Who is, uh, D.J. Georgiade? What? D.J. Georgiade? What's his connection with Bobby? I thought he was kidding. I thought he was, um, making up a story like some people do to come off bigger than they are, you know? What kind of story? Bobby said... He said he changed his name to Bobby George. He said his father was D.J. Georgiade. The head of the hotel chain. Mm-hm. But it couldn't be. I... I mean, the guy's a jillionaire. He must own a hundred hotels. (sighs) Bobby couldn't be his son. Check it out in New York, Danno. Will you call his office? Yeah. Bobby's gonna be okay, isn't he? I don't know. Well, uh... I mean... Oh, man. ANCHORMAN (on TV): Good evening. And topping our late-evening news final tonight, still the story of the apparent kidnapping of popular young singer, Bobby George. We'll have the latest details on that story, and the rest of tonight's news, in just a minute. MAN (on TV): Nature. Litter isn't carried by insects, it doesn't fall from the... Hey. Bobby, hey. (moans) They're talking about you on the TV. Mm. Every litter bit hurts you. Carry a litter bag in your car or boat. Save your trash for the nearest litter basket. Keep your home beautiful. Keep America beautiful. Pop singer Bobby George was kidnapped tonight at the Swinger Club, only minutes after he'd finished his stage act. We don't have many details yet, and the Honolulu Police Department says it really doesn't have any leads. Bobby George's father has now been identified as D.J. Georgiade. He's the owner of the big Georgiade hotel chain. He was notified immediately. Reportedly, he's on his way to Honolulu. Witnesses at the club said that two armed men took the young singer out the back entrance. Police are now waiting to see if there will be a contact to demand ransom money. Georgiade boarded a plane at Kennedy Airport in New York tonight, but he had no comment for waiting reporters. New York. Hey, man, New York. That's it, baby. Coast to coast. Honolulu and all points in between. We got them. (TV clicks off) It's working. Yeah, and by tomorrow, the rest of the mainland will have picked it up. "Bobby George snatched." Headlines all over. Bobby George, the star. Hey, man, the star. There won't be a club or a TV show anywhere that won't be begging you to sign. (sizzling) (laughing) ( menacing theme playing) (all laughing) (airplane flying overhead) Mr. Georgiade? Yes? McGarrett. Five-0. State Police Unit. Is there any news? I'm sorry, sir. Not yet. You should have made more progress by now. Attorney General is waiting for you. I think we can get you through the news media. Why? Mr. Georgiade, this is an extremely delicate time in a kidnap case. I strongly advise you not to make any public statements. My attitude is no secret. I just want my son back. Then take my advice: say nothing. (indistinct chatter) MAN: Practice, practice. Have you had any contact from the kidnappers yet, Mr. Georgiade? Mr. Georgiade has no comment to make at this time. Please, gentlemen. Are you prepared to pay off any ransom fee? Let us through, please. No comment. When was the last time you saw your son, Mr. Georgiade? No comment. No comment. Did you ever think that this would happen? Uh, just a minute, gentlemen. Just a minute. I'm gonna give you a statement. I advise you not to make any st... I'm very upset over what's happened. I'm also very upset so far that your police have been able to do absolutely nothing. I mean to rectify this situation. This gentleman with me is, uh, Peter Taylor, head of my company's security forces. Does that mean you're gonna conduct your own investigation? I wouldn't answer that. It means that I'm gonna do anything and everything I can to get my son back. What exactly do you have in mind? I'm not at liberty to disclose our plans, other than the $5,000 reward I'm now offering for information. That means any information. No questions asked. Complete guarantee of secrecy. Another question, Mr. Georgiade. Any comment, McGarrett? No. I think you made a mistake at the airport. The advice McGarrett gave you to make no comment is practical and sound in a case like this. I expect more from the Attorney General of this state than mere platitudes. What about the FBI? They've been alerted, and they're cooperating. Red tape, silence, platitudes. A man can get better help and advice from his enemies. Let me set you straight, Mr. Georgiade. The greatest enemy your son has right now is you. Look, I don't... I don't have to take that kind of abuse. McGarrett and every available man of Five-0, the Honolulu Police Department and the FBI are working to find your boy. And we will find him, unless you blow it by offering to exchange a bag full of money for a bullet in his head. No, that's ridiculous. Not to a kidnapper. For him, it's an easy payoff, and nobody to put the finger on him. So if you wanna give your son the best chance of getting back alive, let us handle it. (intercom buzzes) Yes? Just a moment, please. It's for you, Steve. McGarrett. Yeah, what do you got, Danno? Good, thank you. Excuse me, gentlemen. ( ominous theme playing) Mr. Georgiade, in McGarrett, you've got the best. Believe me, the best. Carol found it in her mailbox. Addressed to her in Bobby's handwriting. Only her prints are on it. BOBBY (on tape): Carol... I'm being forced to make this recording. They've made me handle it and load the machine, so if the police get hold of it, they won't find any fingerprints. So far I'm okay. They haven't hurt me or anything. Honey, you have to get in touch with my father. Tell him to come to Hawaii right away. These people wanna contact him about money. Talk to him when he gets here. Tell him please, for the first time in his life, cooperate. I'm scared that they'll kill me. (clicks tape off) No postage. It must have been hand-delivered. Kono, check it out. See if you can find anybody who saw this being put in the mailbox. Chin's already started. I'll double up. Danno, take this tape over to KGMB-TV, to Charlie, uh... Grey. Yeah. I wanna know everything about it. Who made it. Who sells it. How old it is. Everything. I want a full audio test made. Every noise, breath and background sound they can bring up, huh? Yeah. Right. At least we know he's still alive. JERRY: I just don't wanna be caught with a victim on my hands. You die, baby. Jerry. Orthodox procedure, kid. Never get caught with a fish hanging around longer than you have to. Close your eyes. Hold your breath. One... No, J... two... (laughing) You believed it. You really believed it. (laughing) Don't you ever... Don't you ever do that to me again. Bobby, baby, I was just putting you on. Hey. What's going on? Nothing. (panting) Was it any trouble? No, not a bit. Nobody even looked at me. Here, baby, you need that. Hey, man, you just missed all the fun. I just scared old Bobby so bad, I almost blew his mind. What do you mean? I just acted out for him what it would be like. For real. Very funny. Oh. Hey, was there any, uh... Any talk? Yeah, lots of it. Hey, they found Bobby's car where we dumped it. They must have the tape by now. Boy, I bet the cops are really sweating Carol. "Did you see anybody suspicious? Who were his friends?" Yeah. Well, the minute somebody says friends, we're gonna be on that list. You'd better believe it, baby. Good old Jerry and good old Allen. But there is no way that they can tie us in. But no way, baby. (snaps open knife) (laughing) BOBBY: Carol, I'm being forced to make this recording. They've made me handle it and load the machine, so if the police get hold of it, they won't find any fingerprints. So far I'm okay. They haven't hurt... Charlie. Hi, Steve. How we doing? Okay. I checked the serial number of the tape with the local stock on the island. It's professional stuff. Beaty's Music Center is the exclusive outlet. They're checking sales records now. Good start, Danno. You got anything, Charlie? Mm-hm. Take a look. BOBBY: Carol, I'm being forced to make this recording. They've made me handle it and load the machine. There's a high frequency signal coming from the microphone, the mike cable, or some kind of interference from the set itself. Whatever it is, we'll be able to identify the tape recorder, if you ever find it. That's good evidence for a courtroom. But right now, I'd settle for anything that might tell us where they are. (telephone rings) Charlie. Hold on. Beaty's. Huh. Yeah, this is Williams. All right. I want a complete list. They're making a list, but, uh, one thing's for sure... Bobby George bought a lot of that tape himself. We're ready now, Mr. Georgiade. Mr. Georgiade, talk right to the lens. Be forceful. Make them know you mean it... I know how to talk into a camera, Taylor. And I know how to talk to these people who are holding Bobby. ANNOUNCER: A KGMB News Bulletin. Ladies and gentlemen, a statement from the father of the kidnapped entertainer, Bobby George, Mr. D.J. Georgiade. I'm directing this statement, this appeal... to two men only. The men who kidnapped my son, Bobby. I received your taped message. And I understand it. And I assure you, I mean to cooperate with you as fully as I can. Believe me, I mean what I'm now going to say. I will pay you anything you ask. Anything... for the release of my son. But I plead to you... don't hurt him. There's no need for it. No need at all. Just, uh... Just tell me where you wish me to contact you, and I'll meet with your demands. I'll wait for your further instructions. You've just heard a statement from Mr. D.J. Georgiade, owner of the Georgiade hotel chain. Hey, how about that? Yeah. Yeah, my old man's been keeping busy on the tube all right. Talk about publicity. You're getting even more coverage than you figured. He looked kind of worried, didn't he? Huh? My old man, he looked kind of... I don't know. It's been five years. I guess they age fast when they reach his bracket. The way he kept saying he'd pay anything. How much you figure your old man's worth, Bobby? Oh, man, I don't know. I don't keep track. Look, I've been thinking. Maybe we better stage my escape right away. I mean, instead of milking it, you know? Why? Well, we made the scene, and it worked out great. Yeah, my old man, he's... He's really worried. Man, you flip me. Why's that? Well, all the time you planned this thing, you kept saying you weren't even sure your old man would fly in from New York. And now you're saying he's worried. I never figured. It gets funny, sometimes you get wrapped up with your own bag. Singing and hotels. Yeah, and then it looks like splitting the scene was real cool. You've got no room for anybody else. You know what I mean? Are you blowing your mind or something, man? Look, I got all the publicity I need, so why don't we just tie me up, blindfold me, and dump me out on the road, huh? If you say so. I was beginning to enjoy all the fuss. But he said he'd pay anything. Really anything. So what? He's Bobby's father. Yeah, but he's loaded, baby. I mean, he would pay anything. All right, come on, fellows. Let's get packed up, huh? Come on. Uh, how much do you figure you're worth to your old man, Bobby? Two, 300,000? Four? What's the difference? Half a million, maybe? Al, what would you do with a half a million bucks? I'd turn on the whole world, man. Yeah, baby. The whole world. Hey, look. Will you guys quit gassing? Come on, I wanna get this thing over with. Now, wait a minute, Bobby. I mean, a half million. Jerry... as my manager, you get 25 percent of the take, right? Making all the big hotels, traveling all over this oyster. Man, I'm telling you it's gonna be swinging, swinging. Twenty-five percent of a question mark doesn't come close to half a million, Bobby. Hey, are you crazy? Now, look, we don't dare go near that money. Even if the old man is willing to put it up. Why not? You said you didn't dig the cat, didn't you? Didn't he? All right, so I said it. Gag's over, that's all. I just don't feel like stretching it. Well, maybe it doesn't matter what you feel like anymore. You brought us this far, we'll take it the rest of the way. Jerry Parks, the practical joker. Now, look, will you stop playing kidnapper and get packed, huh? You're... You're not leaving, Bobby. You're crazy. Allen? Allen, go on. Tell him he's crazy. Two hundred and 50,000 apiece, Al. You heard the news, they don't have a clue. You're both crazy. ( suspenseful theme playing) Allen! Allen, help me! (grunts) Man, I never thought I'd ever do anything like this. Yeah. Neither did I. But I never thought I'd have a half million bucks either. ( dramatic theme playing) This is the kidnap tape we ran originally. BOBBY: Carol, I'm being forced to make this recording. They've made me handle it and load the machine, so if the police get hold of it they won't find... All right, this is the tape you brought me from Bobby George's apartment, recorded on his machine. Now, watch the two of them together. I'm being forced to make this recording. ♪ Ain't no big thing ♪ They've made me handle it ♪ No coffee To fill the cup ♪ so if the police get hold of it, they won't find any fingerprints. ♪ Let 'em roll ♪ So far I'm okay. They haven't hurt me... Hm. Both tapes made on the same recorder. No mistake. Exactly the same. The kidnap tape, the tape from Bobby George's apartment. The pattern's identical. And it was Bobby's machine? No question. Why would they take him back to his apartment? Wait a minute. Right. Never went back to the apartment. Then the only time he could have made the ransom tape was before he was kidnapped. Bull's-eye. This is one big fat hoax. McGARRETT: Mr. Georgiade, we've been had. It's a publicity stunt. I don't believe it. It couldn't have been that way. What else accounts for it? You tell me. I don't know. But I do know that my Bobby could never pull a stunt like that on me. What makes you so sure? He's my son. I know him. How long since you've seen him? What's that got to do with it? He's still my son. Do you know anything about his friends? How he lives, what he thinks, how he feels? All right, all right. I'm a busy man. I haven't seen much of him, but... But I take care of him. How? By sending him checks? You don't know him any better than I do, and I don't know him at all. I'm very tired, McGarrett. I haven't had much sleep since you first called me in New York. But what difference does it make anyway? If it's a publicity stunt, then Bobby's all right, and that's all that counts. No, not quite. Well, you just said it was a hoax. It's also a criminal conspiracy with intent to commit extortion. You're not gonna press charges just because of a practical joke? A joke? There's nothing funny about the hundreds of man-hours and thousands of dollars that have been wasted. Well, figure out the costs and send them to my New York office. Call off your men, and I'll pay the bill. Money fixes everything, huh? Not a chance. I wouldn't call them off if I could. ( tense theme playing) (door closes) Lay it out, Danno. Hundred and three calls reporting Bobby everywhere from surfing in Makaha to waiting on tables. All checked out, all drew a blank. Kono? Seven extortion letters from five drunks and two psychos. Three confessions. A firm offer from some big kahuna to pray him home safe, and that's all, brother. Chin? Big swinger, that boy. Plenty of chicks on the string. Outside of that, all clean. What have you got, Jasper? Zero. But whether Bobby engineered it or not, it's still a kidnap in our books. Okay, we go again, right from the top. Retrace every step. Recheck every lead. Anyone who ever knew Bobby George. (phone buzzes) Yeah? Okay, send him in. Including the ones we missed at Carol's. I want this rock turned inside out. We got to find that kid. This package came special delivery, McGarrett. Mailed somewhere in Honolulu. Dust it. Play it. BOBBY: Dad. Dad, this is Bobby. I-I'm... I'm still okay, I... Sort of. Dad, they're gonna kill me if you don't give them a half a million. They heard you on TV, you said you'd pay anything. Dad, I'm sorry, I... ( smacking) ( BOBBY grunting) All right. Half a million in small denominations. You have 24 hours to get it. And... And you have to put it in two suitcases. And take the suitcases and leave them on the north side of the Kapalama Canal, where it meets Nimitz Highway, before 5:00 tomorrow afternoon. Dad, please. Please tell the police to stay away. Unless the man gets back here safe with the money, they'll... They'll kill me. If he sees anybody around at all, they'll kill me, Dad. And they... They really mean it. They want you to go on TV and... And say you agree. They'll be watching. This doesn't sound like a hoax, McGarrett. No, it doesn't. He's too scared. Danno, take the tape over to KGMB. Run the same test. Right. I've advised Mr. Georgiade to pay. There'll be plenty of time to recover the money later. The important thing is to get Bobby back. We've got work for you to do, Mr. Georgiade. JASPER: We have plans to make about the ransom money. Marking it and plotting the drop. Kono... alert the FBI. Work with them. Sure thing. Where now, boss? Got a date with a couple of swingers. ( dance jazz music playing on stereo) Sure, our guys know Bobby George. They've been swinging together four or five weeks now. What are their names? Jerry Parks and Allen Brent. Allen's mine. Are they, um... close friends of Bobby's? They've been turning it on like... Man. Like, Jerry's gonna be his manager. Make all the big club scenes from Frisco to Roma. Where can I talk to them? On the mainland. What are they doing on the mainland? GIRL 1: Vacation. You sure? Sure, we're sure. We took them to the airport. And you saw them get on the plane? Uh-huh. Why, what's the matter? Where'd they go? GIRL 2: The mainland, we said. Yeah, I know, honey. But which city? Well... the flight was to Los Angeles. Where are they staying in Los Angeles? Can't help you there. They didn't say. Get on the horn to L.A.P.D. right away, huh? Let me know if you hear from, uh, yours or yours, huh? They might be able to help us. Dig? Groovy. Come on, Allen. Sit down. He's all right. I'm scared, Jerry. I mean, suppose his old man leaves the money like we said. And suppose the cops stay away like we said. How do we get away? We are away, baby, remember? Sure, sure. We go to the airport, buy tickets under the same phony names we came back on, and fly off with the money. That's right. Stash the money in the banks on the mainland, come back as us, vacation over. Jerry, who's gonna let us fly off this island once Bobby tells who grabbed him? Sit down, will you? Come on, baby, sit. Now, dig. You gotta get some facts straight. Bobby ain't gonna tell who grabbed him. You're dreaming. (scoffs) You beat the guy up... gag him, tie him... take his father for half a million. And he's not gonna tell anybody? (sighs): That's right. 'Cause he'll be dead. (scoffs) ( dramatic theme playing) Now, wait. I said okay to make a grab for the money, I never said anything about killing him. It's the same thing, buddy. You can't have one without the other. Look, let's just turn him loose and get out of here. Maybe he'll keep his mouth shut. We've already sent the ransom note. We're already holding him against his will. We're already guilty of kidnapping. You think I want to spend my time in prison now? Do you? 'Cause that's what it'd be like and for a lot of years. Oh, man. (claps hands) If I'd known you're gonna be like this, I never would've got into it at all. It was your idea from the start: "Let's get Bobby a little publicity." Did I let you down? No. Even though we could've gone to jail when it was still a joke. Dig, baby, dig. I understand. I know you're scared. So am I. But, Allen, we can do it. You and I together, we can do it. We'd be set for life, baby. For life. Dig it. ( suspenseful theme playing) Well, Jer... how would we do it? I mean, I wouldn't wanna do anything that would make any blood. They always find out about the blood. ( dramatic theme playing) What is that? A song or some music in the background. Sounds like a radio. ( faint music playing on tape) BOBBY (on tape): I'm still okay. Turn it up, will you? Dad, they're gonna kill me if you don't give them a half a million. That's Hawaiian. You said you'd pay anything... Kono, you recognize that song? All right. Yeah. It's an old Hawaiian standard. Half a million in small denominations. Probably trying to drown out any identifying noise, huh? It's definitely a radio or TV. I can just about hear some static. Filter it out by frequency, would you, Charlie? See if you can come up with anything. Anything we can use at all. ( Hawaiian music playing) ( signal whistling) There's something else, but I can't make it out. Wait a minute, it's coming through. No. No good. It's only an airplane passing overhead. Wait a minute. Play it. Play it back. (tape rewinds) BOBBY: Before 5:00... ( signal whistling) ( Hawaiian music playing) ( plane engine humming) Kono, hit every disc jockey on the island. Ask them to check their station logs. I wanna know exactly what time that song went on the air. Sure thing. Danno, that plane we heard was a prop job. Check on all the islands. I want flight plans and times every propeller plane was in the air. Will do. Thank you, Charlie. Great help. Here. Coffee helps. It's a long shot, Steve. Long shots sometimes pay off, Danno. Steve? Yeah. Those two jokers took off for the mainland like the girls said. Checked all return flights, all lines. Their names didn't show. Could be a good setup for an alibi. They fly to the mainland and fly right back under assumed names. What about their apartments? We have them staked. No sign since the day they left. McGARRETT: How about cars? Parked at their garages. Do they have jobs? Allen worked at a souvenir shop. Asked for a vacation, got it. Business was slow. Jerry Parks wasn't working steady. Odd jobs down at the beach. Surf shop, sanding boards, stuff like that. Nobody seen him, nobody missed him. (phone buzzes) Yeah? Danno, it's for you. Sit down. Yeah? Chin, I want a complete rundown on cars, rentals, stolen cars, leases, anything. Anything at all in the way of transportation for those two. Okay, Steve. Gonna be a long night, brother. Ain't no big thing. Got a fix on that song, Steve. It hit the air at 8:05 p.m. Good. Well, that gives us half of it then. I got the other half. Flight plans show three single-engine prop planes in the air that day. Only one that night. A flight from Molokai to Kauai. Lay it out, Danno. Aeronautics said the plane took off at 7:30, and that's 26 miles offshore. Cruising speed... They gave it to us in ground speed. 110 miles an hour. Lay it out in 15-minute intervals. See where it'll put us at approximately 8:05 when that song hit the air. Seven forty-five would be Mokapu Point. Koolau Range, 8:00. Just before Kaone Point, 8:15. Mm. That does it. Wahiawa district. Right. The plane was flying at about, uh, 2,000 feet. It's a good thing they stayed low. Wahiawa, Kunia, Schofield. That's still a lot of ground to cover. Yeah, it could be anyplace between Waipahu and Whitmore. Okay, get the word out. Don't saturate the area... They might get wise and panic. - -but cover it. ( mysterious theme playing) (lightly snoring) (door opens) CHIN: Steve. What do you got? Nothing. Nobody we want showed themselves around Wahiawa district. What about the cars? Nothing leased or rented to anybody fitting the description. They had to get to Honolulu to mail that tape. It's too far to walk. Maybe somebody's driving them. It doesn't figure there are more than two of them. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Maybe Kono's right. Me? How? Somebody is driving them. They could be taking buses. Look. There are two main routes to that area, Kam Highway and Kaneohe Road. Cover them both. Jasper, you get your boys to ride those buses. What makes you think Scott and Parks will come out again? We're gonna force them out. How can you possibly force them out? I can't, but you can. How? Well, you're due to go on the air in two hours to, uh, agree to the ransom, right? Don't try to talk me out of that. Not a chance. Tell them the tape was fouled up. That you need another one for the directions. They'll spot it as a trick. Maybe. If they think so, they may possibly hurt Bobby. Tell him the normal m.o. on a kidnapping. They usually kill the victim when they get the money. I don't know. I do. They'll have to keep Bobby alive long enough to make another tape. McGarrett... I don't have any faith in you or your hunches or your tricks. Mr. Georgiade, I don't much care what you think about me. My only concern is for your son. Then how can you ask me to risk his life on a chance like this? Because if you don't, he doesn't have one. GEORGIADE (on TV): I... I agree with all you say, but... I don't know where to leave the money. Something happened to the tape. I can... I can hear Bobby start to tell me where to leave the money, but... But then it fades. Please. Please repeat your instructions. And again, I... I beg of you... don't hurt my son. ANNOUNCER: A KGMB News Bulletin. (clicks TV off) What do you think, Jer? It stinks. Let's get out of here. Tie him up, leave him. We could be back on the mainland and lost before they find him. We do that, and we lose the money. Look, I don't care about the money. I just wanna get out of this whole thing. You're in, baby, you understand? You're in. Now, cool it about the talk about running. We have Bobby make another tape. You take it into town, and we split fast. And what about Bobby? We have to kill him. I can't do that, Jer. Come on, I just can't do it. All right. I'll do it while you're gone. Meet you in town. ( tense theme playing) Jer... Thanks. Yeah, it's cool. Now, go in there and set up the tape recorder. (sighs) Maintain five-minute checks on all key positions. MAN: Yes, sir. We've got an hour and 15 minutes left for them to move out, or we've got to make the money drop. Sitting out here gives you lots of time to think. Any conclusions? GEORGIADE: I'm not sure there are any. All I'm certain of is... I want my boy back alive. So do we. ( suspenseful theme playing) Hey, what is this? (sighs) It's getting time, Bobby. Come on, Jerry, untie me. No. You and me, we got something to do. It's getting time. (tires screeching) Where is he? Hey, I don't get all this. Where's who? Look. Your time just ran out. If that kid is dead, so are you. Now, look, once more, where is he? I didn't want to have to do it, Bobby, you understand? The whole thing got away from us. I never thought it would be like this. Jerry. Now, Jerry, listen to me. I won't say anything. I swear to you, I'll... I-I'll tell them I never saw you. It's too late. They'd break you, I know it. I don't wanna have to use this. Look, baby, I got these pills. Sleeping pills. Now, you take 'em and it'll be all over. Now, open your mouth. Otherwise, I gotta use the gun. It's gonna hurt. Now, take the pills. (grunting) Use your head, man! It's gotta happen anyway! Why can't you be reasonable? Why can't you do it the easy way? Take the pills. (grunting) You see what you've made me do? I told you I didn't wanna have to hurt you. You can never listen. You've had it so good all these years. You've had it easy. For once in your life, make it easy for somebody else. Now, take the pills! (grunting) (door slams open) ( dramatic theme playing) He's still breathing. Get on the horn. Get an ambulance. Yes, sir. You all right? (gasps) I guess you wanna take me down and book me, huh? You guessed right. Look, I... I know what I did is all very stupid, and I'm... I'm sorry. You hotshots are always sorry when the damage is done. Your old man's over there. I don't think I can face him. Look. You're not gonna cop out on this. You're going over there and talk to him. ( melancholy theme playing) ( upbeat surf theme playing)
