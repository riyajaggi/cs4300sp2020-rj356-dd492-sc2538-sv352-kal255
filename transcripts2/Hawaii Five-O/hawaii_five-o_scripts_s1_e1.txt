 ( dark, mysterious theme playing) (cork pops) Whoa! (laughs) Beautiful. Well... are you ready? (giggles) Oh, goodness, I shouldn't have anymore. That first one made me so dizzy. Oh, come on. No. One more toast. All right.

 That's it. One more toast. For you. To you and Victor. To a happy future. (clink) To us, darling. To us, darling. And to our new home. And, oh, I'm so anxious to see our new lot and make plans. And... Oh, Victor, it's like a dream. A dream. Look at that sky. I wanna see it.

 How lovely. Oh, the sky is really so beautiful. Oh, Victor. This is the happiest day of my life. Oh. (glass shatters) (gasping) Well, it took her long enough. I gave her the usual dose. She was tougher than she looked. Boring. Talked right up to the last breath. Oh. WOMAN: Victor. Victor. That was at least two carats A perfect stone. Not worthy of you, my dear. Uh, who'd ever know? We could have had it reset. And die on the word of some blabbermouth jeweler? No, thank you. We've got a successful proven operation. Let's not spoil it. ( slow, dark theme playing) It is a lovely sky, isn't it? Yes. So peaceful. ( menacing theme playing) Say our poem, Vic. Full fathom five The widow lies: And of her bones Are coral made; Those are pearls That were her eyes: Nothing of her Now doth fade But doth suffer A sea-change Into something Rich and strange. Sea-nymphs hourly Ring her knell: Hark! now I hear them... Ding-dong, bell. ( upbeat surf theme playing) Can you tell me where McGarrett's office is? Second floor, up those stairs. Can't miss it, sir. Eight-by-10 prints on Martha Finch up from the lab as directed. Thank you, love. Very distinctive. No more than 10,000 women in Honolulu can meet this general description. Okay, distribute through all the regular channels. Make sure we're covered interisland, huh? Coffee, Mr. Skaggs? I beg your pardon? Coffee? No, no, no. I never touch it. One, May. Here's the case file, Steve. It's growing fast. We got on it as soon as you called. Good. Gentlemen, this is Tyler Skaggs, the missing girl's attorney. State Police Officers Danny Williams, Chin Ho Kelly and Kono Kalakaua. Okay, what have we got? Found her banking contract. Yeah? No action lately. But she cashed $5,000 in traveler's checks two weeks ago. Let's look for a lady with a big purse, huh? Thanks, love. How about car rentals? Checked. No Martha Finch. McGARRETT: Guided tour outfits? DANNY: Zero. McGARRETT: What about a driver's license? Double zero. Internal Revenue, withholding? She's not making any money here. How about hotel security officers? Not registered anywhere. Try the Visitors Bureau sheet? STEVE: The incoming reports stated she was supposed to be here for two weeks, only on Oahu. No local address. Anybody think to, uh, check the utilities? Wherever she's at, she's got no gas, light or water. Clean. Too clean. Brilliant. Just brilliant. What would you suggest, Mr. Skaggs? I suggest you stop talking and start looking. Where? Well, police work is your job, Mr. McGarrett, not mine. Exactly. Kono... Chin... take some of those 8-by-10s. Make sure that every hotel doorman and maitre d' in town get one. Notify on sight. Right, then what? Check with the public service directors of the various radio and television stations. See if we can get some spot announcements. And then? Then use your imagination and training. You're a rich haole lady, and you wanna disappear. What would you do? Man, that'll take a whole lot of imagination. Come on, brother. Danno. Feed this whole thing into the computer and see if you can come up with anything like it. Run out any similarities on missing women and where they were found. Okay, Steve. It'll take some time, I gotta pull the files by hand on whatever names the machine turns up. You're not getting very far, are you, McGarrett? How would you know? Well, I've seen a lot of hustle, bustle and dust, but all you've come up with is wind. Not exactly, Mr. Skaggs. I can tell you something about Martha Finch right now. Some wild guess, McGarrett? Police instinct. When somebody vanishes as completely as this for this length of time... either Martha Finch wanted to disappear... or she's dead. WOMAN (over PA): Announcing Flight 14 from New York and Los Angeles now arriving at Gate 8. Well... Try and find one that plays three-handed bridge. I always ask, for your sake. Oh, and go easy on the pâté. You put on 2 pounds on the last voyage. You're so thoughtful for me. Well, I don't care myself. But your appearance means a lot to the business. Well, I wish you were coming with me, at least on the flight. It's getting to be a real bore. I have enough to do here. Perhaps there will be a good film on the plane. Oh, a nice romantic one. That's what I'd like. That's the kind that really brings tears to my eyes. Flight 190 for Los Angeles and Chicago now ready for boarding at Gate 9. Aloha, baby. (plane droning overhead) Milly. Oh, hi, McGarrett. Gotta see the man. Not in, McGarrett. Where is he? Lunch. Where? Come on, Milly. It's urgent. (sighs) Well, the place he goes when he usually doesn't wanna be disturbed. Thanks, love. Know it well. (chuckles) ( light, bouncy theme playing) Governor? Steve. Heh. I see you found me again. I'm sorry to bother you, sir, but I think we've come up with something. Oh, sit down. Thank you. Papaya, apple? No, thank you. Ten? At least ten, maybe more. How did you uncover this, Steve? I put Danny Williams to work on the old Missing Persons Index. We were looking for a way to go on this Martha Finch case. He turned up those, all in the suspense file. None of the cases ever closed. All right, spell it out. Well... the cases turn up about once a month. Too many factors alike for it to be a coincidence. Women are always between 30 and 50. Always widowed or single... traveling alone. Return reservations always canceled. Never any close relatives that miss them too soon. Sometimes the first missing report didn't come in till two months after the woman checked out, leaving no return address. Some of them must have got back home eventually. No. We checked that out too, sir. We wired the police at the point of origin of the complaint. Ten different mainland cities. Ten cases still open. Yet there's not a shred of physical evidence. No unidentified bodies, no clothing left behind, no, uh, valuables reported missing. Nothing. That's too much coincidence, Steve. And there's a clincher. Each one of them had money. In every case... there was a large transfer of money here from a mainland bank just before the disappearance. So add it up. Well, the way I read it, sir... first comes the swindle... then a murder. And it's got to be stopped. Two million guests a year pass through here. We invite them. And we're responsible for their safety. ( dramatic theme playing) McGarrett... I think you take some sort of a perverse pleasure in running me around on wild-goose chases. All you have to do is take a look at the girl. Then I can spare your company. But why do we have to come all the way out here? Why couldn't you bring her down to your office? Because we had no charge on which to hold her. She wouldn't come with Danny, but she agreed to see you here. (guitar being strummed) (door closes) You're joking, of course. No member of the Finch family would be found mixed up with this... This subculture. Just take a look at the girl, huh? Martha? Hi, Tyler. Martha. Well, there must be some reason for this strange behavior of yours. This weird costume you're wearing. I don't know. What's the reason for yours? You know, none of this is really very funny, Martha. I suppose you did get my notice about the expiration date on these oil leases? Uh-huh. I'm not interested. (paper hits ground) Nonsense. Of course you are. You still don't dig, man. I'd have to live forever to spend half my bread. As it is, the interest piles up faster than I can throw it away. That's not the point. Yeah, it is. This is all the... The nerve ends I've got. I can't buy more. Now, why should I worry about making money for someone like you? Well, if you'll just sign these, why, we'll... worry about your new philosophy later. No. Martha, I don't have time to play games with you. Then stop playing and listen. The word is "no." And by the way, you're fired. Martha, you are an intelligent woman. Now, surely you know that you cannot continue to act in this unreasonable manner. Tyler, I inherited you and the money when I was just a dumb girl. And you've both bugged me long enough. Now, this hippie scene may not be the answer, but it's taught me one thing: I can do what I want. And I dearly want to be rid of you. So goodbye. Martha, I will take you to court. I will petition them to... To appoint a... A business manager. A-a conservator for you. I already have one. Who is he? Pepito! (continues strumming guitar) Where did you find him? In a tree. Would you mind driving me to town? I have to keep an appointment with my shrink. Sure. Well, you're a witness, McGarrett. You can testify to her unreasonable and abnormal behavior when I take her to court. I don't think it'll do any good, Mr. Skaggs. There's no law that can force the rich to get richer. Well, there should be. Any time we can help you find another missing person, let us know. Peace, brother. (car door closes) McGarrett! (car starts) Wow. (car door closes) (people laugh, applaud) Steve. We got another one. Let's have a look. Name's Anne Hayes. Age, 34. Widow. No immediate family. Came over on a cruise ship a couple of months ago. Checked in at the Ilikai, checked out two weeks later. Return reservation by plane canceled. The inquiry was made by a nephew, forwarded by the Cincinnati P.D. Missing Persons can't turn up a trace. What was the, uh, sailing date of the ship she was on? Uh... early August. How about the money angle? She was carrying a letter of credit on her bank in Cincinnati. She negotiated $20,000 on it a week after she left the hotel. No banking activity since then. Yep. Here it is again. Take a look. "Victor Rawlins." Who is he? He's the one common link in every case. In every case the women came over by ship, first class, San Francisco to Hawaii. Ten times... 11 now he's been on a ship that brought them over. He's the only repeat passenger on every voyage. Seems a little more than a coincidence. Still, it's no crime. No. All we have is a name. Nobody to go with it. How do we find him? Here's the makeup for the ship sailing day after tomorrow from San Francisco. He's booked again. You'll be on that ship, Danno. My job is to see how he operates. What do we use for bait? How about a nice, young, rich widow? That's Joyce. Yeah, do you know her? Sure I know her. And her two little kids. You can't hand her this kind of an assignment, Steve. Why not? Because it's too risky. Policewoman Joyce Weber, last seven years on Bunco Squad, H.P.D. Outstanding record, dozen citations. Sound qualified? Of course she is. That's not the point. We screened at least a dozen possibilities with chief, Dan. She's the one. The best. I don't like it. Nobody asked you. Make up a complete cover history for her, with documents to prove it. Can you have them by noon tomorrow? Sure. Forgery was my best subject. All right, Joyce, final checkout. What's your name? Helen May Carlson. Maiden name was Fitzsimmons. Tell me about your husband. His name was Walter Alan Carlson. He died about a year ago. We lived in Portland, Oregon at 4225 Alfred Street. Where did you get your money? My husband's family had money. And he was a successful insurance executive with Northwest Underwriters. Being insurance conscious, he left me a very large policy. Ever been to Hawaii before? Never. I'm going over to see if I can make a new start. Everything at home reminds me of Walt. I wanna get away from all that. Anyone close to you, Anybody who would miss you? No. We had no children. Walt had no brothers and sisters. My only sister lives in New York. I'm sort of alone in the world. What's your bank? First National of Portland. Account number 561-322. Okay. Show me your driver's license. Social-security card. Bankbook. Letter of credit. Marriage license. Picture of your husband. Why do you carry your marriage license if your husband is dead? Just foolish sentimentality, I guess. Still clinging to the past. That's why I want a new start. Good girl. You'll do fine. Okay. From here in, you're on your own. I don't wanna be seen with you. How about my bags? Danny checked them through. You can pick your overnight bag up in San Francisco. The rest will go right to the ship. There's your taxi. Where will I meet Danny? On the ship. He'll contact you. Okay, Joyce. Be careful and go with God. Joyce. I goofed already. Yeah. And that can cost you your life. Mahalo. What does that mean? Good girl. Why should you know mahalo means "thank you," huh? You've never been to Hawaii before, have you? Never. ( slow, placid theme playing) So I said to the captain: "Well, if that's the situation, just let me speak to the chef personally." Oh, uh, the chef, you know, is recently divorced. And he has an ulcer, of all things. So I... Excuse me. But that... That lady standing over there. Yes, what about her? Well, I... I don't know. She looks familiar, but I can't place her. Isn't she at your table? Yes, poor thing. She's terribly shy and withdrawn. You can hardly pry an answer out of her. She's obviously just gone into a shell since her husband was killed. Oh. How did it happen? Some sort of plane crash in the Rocky Mountains somewhere. The fool had gone hunting, leaving that dear girl at home by herself. Well, there was a blizzard or something, and down he went. Oh, I daresay, it's been very hard for her. Why, he left her in financial difficulty? Oh, no, nothing like that. Quite the contrary, so I gather. Although she hardly speaks of it. He was a big insurance executive. And I guess he was pretty proud of his product. Money was all he left her. He couldn't have children, which is what she really wanted. It's strange. I'm sure I know her. Met her somewhere. Isn't her name Marie? No. No, it's Helen. Helen Carlson from Portland, Oregon. Never out of there in her whole... Well, I'm sorry. Afraid I'm gonna have to leave you now. I've got some business with the purser that I have to attend to. You know, it's always a pleasure talking to you, Mrs. Willoughby. Will we, uh, see you later on the shuffleboard deck? Oh, gee, I'll try. But don't count on me. I have something important that I should attend to. Excuse me, will you? Mm-hm. ( slow, mysterious theme playing) ( slow, moody theme playing) Care to play a game? No, thank you. Mind if I watch? Met him yet? You will soon. He's going through your stateroom. Good. That shows a certain amount of interest. Joyce, be careful. Don't take any unnecessary chances. We don't know how these people operate. We'll both do it the best way we know how. He just came in across the lounge. He's talking to the steward. Well, if you ever learn that game, look me up. I beg your pardon. Mrs. Helen May Carlson? Yes. I believe this is yours. I've been losing everything lately. Thank you. Not at all. How did you know it was mine? Well, I took the liberty of asking the deck steward whose cabin that was. Well, thank you very much. I... I'm afraid I've put you to a lot of bother. It was well worth it. I have an old-fashioned sense of responsibility, and now it's satisfied. I'm sorry, won't you sit down? Well, the young man, uh, isn't he returning? I hope not. Well, my name is Rawlins. Victor Rawlins. Pleasure to meet you. I see you have an interesting problem set up here. One of the chief interests of my life is chess. I'm afraid I'm badly out of practice. I haven't played much this... This last year. Hm. Well, then you won't notice how badly I play. (chuckles) Now, about that problem... ( slow, playful theme playing) (typewriters clacking) What do we got? From Danny. Just came in. We're in the ball game. Chin, come in here right away, please. Run this through gun registration. See what we come up with. It's done. What do you know about laundry marks? Well, some of my best ancestors are Chinese. Do you think we can locate the place that uses that? This look like a case for my Uncle Chan. (speaking in Chinese) Confucius once said, "We got a winner, boss." Let's go. Come on. (band playing festive music) (crowd chattering) Nora! This is my sister, Nora. This is Helen Carlson. Welcome to Hawaii. Hello. Aloha. Thank you. She absolutely saved my life. VICTOR: Made the whole voyage a delight, except for one thing. She beat me in chess three times. Oh, congratulations. Vic usually beats me. I hope you'll help me keep him in his place. I'll do the best I can. (guffaws) Hey, hey. Ha-ha. Smile. (clicks) Man, that shirt's blinding me. So was the price. How's Joyce doing? Beautifully. A real pro. Any line on the swindle? So far it's all hearts and flowers. He's the perfect gentleman. Got anything on the sister? It's not his sister, it's his wife. What else do you know? His name is Reese, not Rawlins. He's got two expensive cars and a beautiful big home up on Tantalus Drive in the hills. Internal Revenue has him down as an art dealer reporting $18,000 last year. He spends twice that amount, always in cash. Very interesting. But none of it will impress the DA. Have we got anything to pull him in? Not even a traffic citation. He's clean. Absolutely clean. We've gotta find another way to go, Steve. Gotta pull Joyce out. When I went through Victor's cabin, I found some capsules. I ran them through the ship's pharmacy. Poison, aconite. Aconite? That's right. The minute they even suspect Joyce, she's dead. Another wonderful evening. I hate to see it end, but I am awfully tired. Get some sleep. We have some wonderful sights to show you tomorrow. You and Nora have done nothing but entertain me. You really don't have to, Vic. Nonsense, it's what I wanna do. Now, you must know how serious I am about you. Hm? It's... It's just been a long time. All right. Good night. (metal pinging) (sighs) Sorry to startle you... but it's time for a talk. I've been trying to contact you, but I... I can't get out of their sight. It's like being in an invisible net. That's why I'm here. We've taken over the adjoining suite. Now, uh, somebody will be listening all the time. The door's fixed in case you need us in a hurry. Oh, that's good to know. Listen... where do we stand? Have you got enough to make a case? We've got absolutely nothing except what you can tell us. Well, then you've really got nothing. They're so charming, it's spooky. Any attempt to get money? No, but I think it may be coming. He keeps talking about a great piece of property up in the hills. He says he wants to buy it, but something's holding up the deal. Then the only thing we know for sure is that we've got the right couple, huh? Joyce, I wanna tell you something. You can get out of this right now if you want to. We can get you out of here tonight, and you'll never have to see either one of them again. No, no, no, no. I couldn't live with myself if we let these slimy parasites off the hook. And I couldn't live with myself if anything happened to you. I'll yell if I need you. Good. And I'll be there. I promise. ( slow, moody theme playing) (door opens) (door closes) Steve, I think you're wrong. It's too dangerous. Can you come up with something? Any other way of getting the job done? Pull Joyce out. Get a warrant. Give the house a thorough going-over. There's gotta be something to tie them to the previous victims. Let the crime lab in there with a microscope. As far as we know, not one victim has been allowed near that house. What about jewelry? If we could come up with even one identifiable item, at least... (knock on door) Come in. You'd be surprised how much all tourists in aloha shirts and muumuus look alike to hotel help. Any positive identifications? I found a few who remembered seeing one of the women in the pictures... a few who thought they saw Victor and Nora, but none of them would swear they'd ever seen them together. What about their car? We got to the garage owner. When the car came in for service, we vacuumed it. Every crevice. Anything? The crime lab sifted it. No blood, no epidermis, no threads, no hairs. Nothing. Just good old Hawaiian lepo. What? Dirt. Well... whether we like it or not, it's still up to Joyce. (file hits desk) JOYCE: Oh, Vic, it's just perfect. VIC: It would be perfect if we could share it. JOYCE: You're making it very hard to say no. VIC: Well, then say yes. If you say yes, we can build our honeymoon house right here on this lot. It's as simple as that? If I say the wish, it comes true? Well... it's not quite that simple, but... I'll make it come true. What's the problem? Oh... sort of complicated. You see, I sold my house... The one I told you about up by the university? Well, I sold it intending to buy this lot and build here right away. And the fellow I sold to up and died. Had a heart attack. And so now his estate is tied up, And my money is in it, you see. And it may be two months before it's settled. But you're bound to get it then, aren't you? Oh, of course. But in the meantime my option to buy this lot is expiring, and there's another buyer just waiting to... You know, he's prepared to step in and pay cash. There must be other lots you can buy. Not bargains like this. My option to buy this lot is 30,000 cash. The other buyer is prepared to step in and pay 40,000 if my option expires. So even if you didn't wanna build here, you'd make money buying this property. Oh, 10,000 overnight. But... I'd rather have this lot for our home. Vic? Mm? I have money we could use. Oh, no, you don't. Oh, no. None of that. You know, I don't know what it is with you and Nora, but she's already agreed to let me mortgage the gallery if we need to. And I think she thinks she's found a sister or something. She's gonna help me raise the money. But there's no need of all that. I could get the money easily. Well... Ah, you know... we need the money rather quickly. My option expires next week. I have a letter of credit on a bank here. It's at the hotel. I could probably get the money right away. Today. Does this mean that you accept my proposal? Oh, darling. Mmm. Baby. I tell you what we'll do. I'll, uh... I'll drive you to your hotel... and we'll get in touch with Nora and tell her. And tonight the three of us will celebrate with a sunset cruise. You have a boat? Mm. A little surprise been saving to show you. Just a... It's nothing. A 40-foot runabout. Victor, I suspect there are a lot of things you haven't told me about. Very few. Very few. But tonight, in honor of the occasion, I promise you a surprise of a lifetime. ( dark, mysterious theme playing) (phone buzzes) McGarrett. Yeah, Joyce. Yeah, we saw Victor drive away. How you doing, honey? Okay, except I'm a little short of funds. I need $30,000 this afternoon. I'm helping Victor buy some real estate. We know the location. We've been keeping you in sight all morning. That's good because I have a feeling my life expectancy will drop sharply after I hand over the money. Well, we can move in now if you want. We could at least get them on swindling charges. No. No, uh, hold off till later. You may find out about the murders too. They're taking me out on a boat ride. Victor's private cabin cruiser. Where is it? What's the name? He wouldn't tell me anything about it. It's a little surprise, he says. All right, we'll find it. Now, the money will be waiting for you at 2:30 at the First Central Bank. You'll be followed from there. You need anything else? Just a lot of courage. You've already got enough of that for all of us, love. Take care, huh? Danny, Kono. May, get me the harbor commissioner's office, Boat Registration. Danny, make me up a packet of marked bills, $30,000, to be delivered to First Central Bank at 2 p.m. this afternoon. Right. Kono, get me a bug with a transistor small enough to plant, and a receiver-recorder. Put them in my car. I'll be down in five minutes. On the line. It's Ron. Ron? Yeah. McGarrett, Five-0. I need the complete make on a boat registered to Victor or Nora Reese. Yeah, Reese. R-E-E-S-E. McGARRETT: We need about a dozen men to cover the various moorages around Honolulu. Another half a dozen for the Kailua-Kaneohe area. Probably two or three to cover the southern tip of the island. We'll be in constant radio contact. I don't have to tell you, lieutenant, we're working against time. You've got the description and registration. I'll get on the radio and contact the Kailua substation. You'll have men at the harbor there in five minutes. Good. All right, let's move. ( action theme playing) The money's waiting at the bank. Chin's staked out, ready to start trailing procedure. Good. Now all we have to do is find Victor's boat and get there before they do. Let's put it another way: before Joyce's name turns up on another missing-persons report. Chin Ho to Five-0. Joyce is leaving the bank now with Victor and Nora. Same red convertible. Tailing procedure underway. Good, Chin. Stay with them and keep in touch. Five-0 to Dispatch. This is Dispatch. Go ahead. What's the status of the boat search? Honolulu reports negative for all moorages. Units are working south to Hanauma Bay. Kailua reports also negative. Ditto at Kaneohe. Units are now in Lanikai. Okay, Five-0 out. We're running out of time. What if they don't find that boat? I guess we'll have to follow them to it from Chin Ho's directions. Yeah, and it could be anywhere. And they could have Joyce onboard before we even get started. Yeah, they could. Kono to Five-0. Read me, Steve? Yeah, Kono. Loud and clear. We're at Kahana Bay. Victor's boat is tied to a public dock in the park. Name doesn't match, but the registration and description do. Nobody's around. Good. Good, Kono. We're on our way. We're gonna cut it awful close. I figured we got about a half an hour to get there and get things fixed. (engine starts) ( action theme playing) (engine sputters) Something's wrong. She won't start. I don't understand. It worked perfectly well yesterday. I'd just as soon not go out today. I'm... I've really got a rotten headache. Vic, please, just take me back to the hotel. No, no, no. I guess we'll have to have our celebration right here. Nora, get the champagne. Oh. (chuckles) There we are. To your engagement. To our engagement. (breaks on deck) Oh, I'm sorry, I... I'm just nervous, I guess. Get her another glass, Nora. No, please. I... I really don't feel well. It wouldn't agree with me. I-I... I'd better just go back to the hotel. Money's all there. I counted it. Want me to take her inside? What do you mean, take me inside? Well, I'll tell you, Helen, uh... truth of the matter is, we're getting ready to kill you. It's a very silly joke, Vic. It's no joke. We mean it. I don't believe you. Why would you wanna do anything like that to me? Now, Helen, this is getting to be all rather boring. I was hoping you'd have the grace to die with a smile on your lips like the others have. But unfortunately, your clumsiness has ruined all that. Let's go. So we'll have to find another way. (boat running) All right, Reese. You're under arrest. (gunshots) ( dark, brooding theme playing) Joyce, you all right? I'm fine, I think. He's dead. He always was the lucky one. ( upbeat surf theme playing)
