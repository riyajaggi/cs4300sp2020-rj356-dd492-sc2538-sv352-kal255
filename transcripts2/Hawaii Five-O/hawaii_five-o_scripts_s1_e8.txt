 Hawaii Five-O (1968–1980): Season 1, Episode 8 - No Blue Skies - full transcript 
 McGarrett is investigating a cat burglar who pulls off jobs in spectacular fashion. His most recent heist totaled $30,000 of jewels from a room in a high-rise hotel. The culprit is Joey Rand, a lounge singer who's also a compulsive gambler who owes a Mainland syndicate $200,000. His girlfriend, who works for a company that does tours, supplies Joey with the names and room numbers of well-to-do people. Joey is now the target of a determined McGarrett and the syndicate that's ready to kill him over the singer's gambling debts.

 Steve. Jim. What have we got? Well, the room was hit sometime between 9 and 9:30 while the occupants were out. Where are they now? Downstairs in my office, making a list of the stolen articles. Any estimate of the value? Lady claims in the neighborhood of $30,000. Nice neighborhood. We got signs all over the hotel. Room clerks warn every check-in: "If you've got any valuables, put them in the safe." But how do you get through to people? How do you get through?

 How many hits does this make? Well, four here on Oahu, one on Maui, one in Kauai. Coming in, I noticed the front door. Looks like the same m.o. He comes down through the lanai and then makes it look like he jimmied the front door. You'd need a sledgehammer to bust those locks. But if it was me, I'd sooner rob a bank than climb down on a rope from that roof. Maybe sooner. ♪ This land is your land This land is my land ♪ ♪ From California To the New York Island ♪ ♪ From the redwood forest To the Gulf Stream waters ♪ ♪ This land was made For you and me ♪ ♪ I roamed and rambled And I spread my footsteps ♪ ♪ To the sparkling sands Of her diamond deserts ♪ ♪ And all around me A voice was singing: ♪ ♪ "Hey, this land Was made for you and me" ♪ ♪ This land is your land This land is my land ♪ ♪ From California To the New York Island ♪ ♪ From the redwood forest To the Gulf Stream waters ♪ ♪ Hey ♪ ♪ This land was made For you and me ♪ ♪ This land was made For you and me ♪ Thank you. How was I? Only sensational. Ha, ha, stick with me, baby. Hey, thank you, folks. Thank you. Next show's at midnight. Come back and bring your friends. This is where it's happening. See you later. There you go, pal. Hey, man, your chick called. And? Let me see, I wanna get it straight. Now you're gonna be part of the act. Come on, you'd better get it straight. Oh, yeah, yeah. She said to tell you that she got hung up on Maui, plane fogged in. Yeah? But, like, for you not to get uptight because her roomie Sarah's gonna take care of the gig, dig? Dumb broad. Is there anything I can do? No, no, forget it. (knock on door) And tell those broads to cool it, will you? I'll be out in a minute. Right. The man says for you to cool it. He'll be out in a minute. (rings) Yes? Nimo, Joey. Did she get there yet? No, she did not. Well, there's been a slight mix-up. We can't afford mix-ups in our business, Joey. All right. Our regular pickup couldn't make it. Her roommate did the gig. She's kind of a screwball. So why don't you run over to 3810 Leahi Street and see what gives, huh? I'll do just that. Linkoa, no rough stuff. Flight number 5 to Los Angeles will be ready to board in five minutes at Gate 9. (screams) It's on the list of stuff stolen from the Ilikai earlier this evening. Did we get a cause of death yet? Looks like she'd been strangled, but we're waiting for the medical examiner's report. Airport security guard found him hiding on the flight deck. (speaks in Chinese) Did he see it? That's what we're trying to find out. What's his name? (speaking in Chinese) Ming Lu. Ming Lu. He speak any English? (speaking in Chinese) Talk to him, Chin. Find out what you can. Ask him if he saw anybody. (speaking in Chinese) Any identification on the victim? MCGARRETT: Sarah Turner. Yes? Miss Michaels? Uh, yes. McGarrett, Five-0. I'd like to talk to you. Well, what did you want to talk to me about? I understand that you shared this apartment with a Miss, uh, Sarah Turner, huh? What do you mean "shared"? She's dead. Maybe you'd better sit down. How did it happen? She was murdered. Do you mind if we look around? Oh, that's Sarah's room. Mr. McGarrett, who...? Why? That's what we're trying to find out. I hope you don't mind, I'll have to ask you some questions. Yes, of course. When's the last time you saw Miss Turner? Uh, when she left for work. What time was that? Uh, around noon, maybe later. Where did she work? At the Golden Anchor. She was a cocktail waitress. Are you sure you didn't see her again after she left for work? Yes, I'm sure. You see, I operate the Sun Tour Agency. I took a group of people to Maui this afternoon. Well, our return plane was delayed. I just got back here myself. What about her friends? Well, she had lots of friends. Any special boyfriend? Well, nobody in particular. She didn't want to be tied down, so she dated a lot of guys. Did you know any of the men she dated? Not really. Uh... You see, Sarah worked for me briefly as a tour guide, but it wasn't exciting enough for her. Well, she led her own life. Looks like she moved out for good. Did you know about the move? No. Isn't that unusual? No. If you live in a house with somebody, you don't check their room every time you come in. Tell them to send the lab boys over. Miss Michaels, may I? Oh, yes, of course. One more question. Do you know anyone who would have any reason to kill Miss Turner? No, Mr. McGarrett. I can't imagine anybody wanting to kill Sarah. It's your fault, Joey. It's your fault. No, baby, no. Yes. And it's mine too. It's mine too. Joey, it's gotta be over now. It's going to be over now. Soon, baby, soon. Not soon, Joey. Now, right now. Oh, Joey. Joey, please. Honey, say it's over now, please? All right, baby. All right, it's over now. I'll write and tell my creditors it's over now. You can whistle for your dough. Joey, we can pay them off between us. Twenty dollars a week for the next 2,000 years. You got a record coming out. It may be a hit. It will be a hit. I know it, I feel it. That's what we're buying, baby, time. Time for the career to really start taking off. Then I can go to those hoods and offer them a piece of my action. Anything to get them off my back. And while we're buying time, Joey, who's the next victim? Huh? You're a gambler. Do you fall off a roof? Or do I wind up with a knife in my back? Or like Sarah? You brought her into the act. You. Do you think I wanted that ape to kill her? Do you? Nobody made her open the bag. Nobody made her try to get off this rock with the whole bundle. She gambled. And lost. And I can bleed for her a little because I've been there. Joey, there's gotta be another way. There's gotta be another way. Sooner or later, they're gonna find out I've been getting those room numbers for you. Baby, listen, listen, listen. You know my manager, Lou. He's turning down offers, Val. Vegas, at twice the loot I've ever gotten. The best places in L.A. And Lou's turning them down. He's gambling that this record's gonna take off on the charts and we're in orbit. Then we can name our own numbers. Two thousand, 3, 5,000 a week. Joey, it's a dream. It happens, Val. It happens to guys who can't hold my guitar. It'll happen to me. From here on in, it's seven, 11. You're crazy. Yeah. Joey... Joey, do you love me? Yeah. No, I want you to say it. I do, baby, I do. No, I wanna hear you say it. Say it. I love you. Yeah, sure you do. Oh, sure you do. Believe in me, Val. Oh, I do, Joey, I do. (speaking in Chinese) What do you got, Chin? Maybe a face. We're getting close. Good. Good. You Nimo Linkoa? Yeah. McGarrett, Five-0. I'd like to talk to you. Joey, I didn't wanna say anything over the phone. All right, I'm here. What is it? They arrested Nimo. When? How? I don't know. McGarrett wants me to come down to the police station for the lineup. Honey, I'm scared. Listen, listen, listen. There's nothing to be scared about. Baby, we covered all the bases. It's just routine. He probably wants to know if you've ever seen Nimo with Sarah. And you'll say no, and that'll be the truth, and that'll be the end of it. Yeah, but will it, Joey? Will it? The scene now is, you don't know from nothing. You dig? Val, baby, I'm counting on you. Okay, I don't know from nothing. That's my girl. That's my girl. Now, there's nothing to be afraid of. We can see them through this glass, but they can't see us. Have you ever seen any of these men before? No. No, I've never seen any of them before. Take a good look. Are you absolutely certain? Yes, I'm sure. All right, Miss Michaels. Thank you. Thank you. Tell Chin we're ready for the next witness. Chin, ready. (speaking in Chinese) He doesn't wanna make identification. Doesn't wanna get further involved. Steve. Yeah? The old man's scared. What's the story? He doesn't wanna get involved. Tell him he'll be given police protection. (speaking in Chinese) Says it'll do no good. He knows nothing. Tell him we need his help. He's the only one who can identify the murderer. (speaking in Chinese) Thank you, Mr. Lu. Talk to him some more. Maybe he'll develop a public conscience, huh? When you release him, I want a man with him 24 hours a day. Okay. Come on, old man. Let's go. (phone rings) Paul Oliwa speaking. Oh, hi, Val. Yeah, he's right here. Ask her if everything's all right. Val, he says, "Is everything all right?" Val says, "Cool, man. Cool." Hey, baby, I love you. You know that? Yeah. Love you. Later, baby. Well, that's it, man, that's the game. Joey's going where the action is. Hey, but you can't. I thought you said the last time that Chinese card shark took everything but your shorts. Pal, when lady luck's riding your shoulder, there's no sweat. Natural seven. Your bet, Rand. A hundred. Call. Call and raise a hundred. Fold. Call. I too call. Cards to the players. King of clubs. Eight of spades. Five of clubs. A thousand. And 2,000. I'm up. Call. Kings up. Three deuces. But you drew an eight. That means you had your deuces all along. Why didn't you raise before? I do not tell you how to play your hand, Mr. Rand. Okay, okay, give me another stack. I'll write a check. Deal. Don't worry about it, I'm good for it. I've got a record coming out. I don't lend money to a dead man, Joey. There's a collector in town. He has a contract with your name on it. You're dead. Deal. I really don't understand why we're down here, lieutenant. I think it's quite clear, Mr. Rand. We picked your car up at the airport from our stolen-vehicle list. Oh, I know, I reported the car stolen. There's nothing unusual about that. No. When we ran a routine check, we found the dead girl's prints on the wheel. Sarah Turner's. Can you explain that, Mr. Rand? Oh, I think I can, Mr. McGarrett. Go ahead. Well, I borrowed Joey's car to do some shopping yesterday. When I got back from Maui last night, it was missing. I guess I left the keys in the ignition. Why didn't you report it as stolen? Well, I thought Joey had picked it up. When I called him at the club, he was on-stage doing his show. And when I got the message she called, I returned it. When she told me about the car, I called the police. How long after you finished your show was that? Oh, half an hour, 45 minutes, maybe. Why the delay, Mr. Rand? Well, I got hung up with some people in the audience. They wanted to buy me a drink. Miss Michaels, after you were told about Sarah Turner, didn't it occur to you that she might have taken the car? No. Why? I don't know, it just never entered my mind. I guess I was too upset. Finished, Lou? Okay, you can go. Thank you. Do you believe their story, Steve? It's plausible. I have a feeling you're not buying it. Not quite. Lou, do me a favor, will you? Run a check on Rand. I got a hunch. Find out anything you can about him. Where he comes from, anything. Done, Steve. What about the suspect you picked up? Nimo Linkoa? I got plans for him. Heading west on Ala Moana. He turned into a driveway on the mauka side of Ward Street between Queen and Kamakee. Steve, I think he's heading for home plate. It's a souvenir shop, W & W Distributors. (beeping) When you hear from the man, just tell him I took my share. Linkoa's inside. Where's Danno? He's in the back. Danno! (sirens blaring) We never see the man. Linkoa, he bring us the stuff. Hi, Steve. Hi, Lou. How'd it work? Well, looks like the jewelry was dropped off here after every hit, marked, reset in cheap costume jewelry, and shipped to L.A. Look at that. Who made the drop? He claims Linkoa. He also claims he never saw the cat burglar, doesn't even know his name. You believe that? Sure, I believe everything. You want me to have this stuff taken downtown? No, I wanna keep the real stuff, we'll ship the rest. Contact the L.A. Police, have them pick up the fence. I'll wrap up these two for you. Okay, let's go. I got the rundown on Rand you wanted. Yeah. He comes from Chicago. I wired the police there to see if they have anything on him. Report just got back. Go. He worked as a rigger with a traveling carnival until he was 19. Rigger? Yeah. That's pretty good basic training for a cat burglar, isn't it? Then he was convicted for manslaughter. Sentenced one to ten years. He did three. Is that all? Thanks, Chin. Oh, one more thing. Yeah. On the street, it's rumored that Rand is stuck for over $200, 000 to a mainland gambling syndicate. Two hundred thousand? Do we, uh, have enough to book him? Mm-mm. Not yet. Miss Michaels? Hello. Do you mind if I sit down? No, of course not. You know, there's been a so-called cat burglar operating all over these islands. I don't usually concern myself with that kind of news. Would it concern you to learn that each of the persons robbed used your tour-guide service? I consider that a rather unfortunate coincidence. Unfortunate for you if you told the cat burglar the room numbers. Gave him information on when the people were out touring. That's a rather strong thing to say, Mr. McGarrett. Yes, it is. Do you have proof? Not yet, but we will. Unless you wanna prove it for us. Why don't you do both of you a favor? We can wrap this thing up right here and now. That's a ridiculous thing to say. How would you and your boyfriend like to spend a couple of years in Oahu State Prison? He's in a bind, Miss Michaels. There's no way out. If he can't pay off the syndicate, he's dead. In fact, he's dead either way. Maybe try another hit and we'll be waiting for him. Or miss his footing. It's gonna happen sooner or later. Mr. McGarrett, if you don't mind, I'd rather finish my drink in private. I don't think you've been listening, Miss Michaels. I've known a hundred Joeys. As soon as he's finished using you, as soon as he makes that one big hit or he gets in a tight spot and he can run faster without you, then comes the kiss-off. But you know that better than I do. Think about it, huh? Joey. Easy, Val, easy. Joey, I came this close to telling him everything. Well, why didn't you? Because I'm crazy, that's why. No, baby, no. Don't blue-sky me, Joey. Listen. Now, listen to me. No more blue skies, Joey. No more snow jobs. Now, this once, let's put it right where it is. That officer, McGarrett, is gonna put us both in jail. No, baby, no, because my luck's turning. I've just started a winning streak, and no two-bit cop's gonna stop me now. You dig? Look, baby. A 50-word telegram from Lou. He's gonna take out ads in the trade papers. Baby, we're home free. Read it loud and clear. Like with wedding bells in the background. For us, Val, for us. Joey. Oh, Joey, it's wonderful. Joey. Why? It's nothing, Val. It's a gun. It's something. Now, listen. My creditors got tired of waiting, and they sent a guy to collect. I figured I might have to argue with him. Joey, get rid of it. Please? Okay, okay. I'll stash it away someplace. I'll get him off my back. That's all over now. I'll tap the record company for enough money to keep the syndicate happy. And if I can pay off, there's no point in knocking me off. Is there? Is there? Oh, Joey. (knock on door) Here's your drink, Joey. Hi, Val. Oh, hi, Paul. Joey, look, what we were talking about before... Forget about it, baby. Forget about it, Val. Like the man said, we just started on a winning streak. And I'm not gonna let anything or anyone blow it for me. Now, believe me, baby. Believe me. Oh, I do. Oh, Joey, I do. Hey, Paul, you take care of him, okay? You know it. I'll see you later. You got a minute? Take five. Hey, is something wrong? Time, kiddo. It's running out on me. Maybe us. Like maybe we're gonna have to split. Yeah, but you promised you'd take me along on your next gig. You know, Las Vegas, New York... Joey, you promised. And I meant to keep that promise. It was for me as much as for you, maybe more. I like having you around. I like you, you dig? Yeah, I dig. But something's come up. Like? Paulie, this could spell trouble. Well, I wanna know. Yeah, yeah. You know, it's like sometimes you're just riffing along, playing it by ear. And, man, like, you hit notes ain't on a scale. Like you can hit anything. It's like you're ten miles tall. I kind of felt like that the other day. Until I ran into a nice gentleman who played it cool with three deuces. The fact is, if there's a pair of dice or a deck of cards around, somebody ought to lock me up. I tried to tell you. I know it. I know it. And from here on in, I swear, you're gonna be in sole charge of the handcuffs and the keys. But first, Paulie, first, I gotta get me out from under. You think you can help me?
