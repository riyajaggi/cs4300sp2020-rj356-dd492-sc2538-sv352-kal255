 Previously on "The Outpost"... "Gallows Rock, sundown." Want to tell me why greyskins would be selling colipsum to humans? Trouble at the cages, sir. They've turned Plagueling and escaped. Ugh! Argh! Lilly was more than just a handmaid to me, Mr. Wythers. And I intend to get to the bottom of this awful business. You murdered her! Your badge, sir.

 Take him to the mine. There is a book full of names. Bring me one page as proof, burn the rest. I think the Book of Names is actually a book full of... Full of demon names? There's some kind of mention of... of the "Vex Rezicon." Does it say anything about the Dragman? No. "Tiberion Shek and Bones dead." We will go there. We will kill the Blackblood. Ho, brewer! Let me have a taste of your wares. These are empty. There's nothing in here that you want. You're straining awfully hard for empties.

 Well, they're not empty. No, I, um, I fill the empties with, um, with... with... with hops and... and barley. Well, then you have to declare them. Taxes, please. Of course. Talon, I'll pay you back double. Should cover it. Should indeed. Two gold beads? A copper would have done just the trick. You're paying me back double, remember? Bloody hell, those things are heavy. You're back. Mistress wants to see you. I need a drink, Janzo. Wanted to see you as soon as you got back. We're a little parched, Munt, so she's going to have to wait a minute. - He's back! - Janzo! Janzo! Good dog. So did they show up? Did the shipment arrive? Well, I'm alive and unharmed, thank you for asking. - Uh-huh. - What did you do with your arm? Oh, well, I broke it. because you abandoned me, and I had to do your job. - Well, are you all right? - Don't worry about the arm. Did... it... show... up? - Yes. - And? And they gave us almost 30 shares of colipsum. 30? That's more than double. That's more than triple. Janzo! Janzo, my favorite son. My favorite boy. How did you manage to get so much out of them? There's something that you should know. What? The colipsum comes from greyskins. Well, it doesn't matter where they came from, as long as it's pure and as long as it's cheap. I don't think you heard me the first time, Mother. The greyskin is the supplier. You know, enemy of the Realm? Number one threat to humankind? Big, ugly, want to wipe us out? Those greyskins. Let me get this straight. You actually saw an actual greyskin? - And they didn't eat you? - No. And they gave you more than you paid for? Yes. They are clearly not as nasty as their reputation suggests. Mother, we shouldn't have anything to do with colipsum coming from greyskins. There's something not right about that. Of course it's right. They're greyskins. They're exotic, and if they want gold, let's give them gold. Where's the harm in that? Mother! They didn't even count it. Of course they didn't count it. They're greyskins. They're dumb as dogs. They probably don't even know how to count. You know... a better man than you would have got me ten brickloads. Is that right? Then send Munt next time. Your precious little shipment's downstairs. He's growing up, that boy. Hello? Hello? Garret? What are you doing in here? I need you to kill me. I was injected by a Plagueling. It's only a matter of time before I turn, so just... kill me now. Well, I'm not going to kill you, Garret. I can't. Oh, come on, Janzo. I don't want to turn into one of those things. - Janzo? Now we had a deal. - Talon. You have to find this Book of Names before this Dragman thing... What's going on? He's been infected. Plagueling. What? How are you feeling? Are you sweating profusely? Is your heart beating fast? I... I don't know. You... you tell me. He's sweating, all right. Hmm. Your heart's definitely beating fast. That might just be because you're scared. I'm not. - Are you drunk? - Are you drunk? I am. Yeah, yeah. I'm quite. But it's because I've been down here all day, and this is very good ale. - Thank you. - Thank you. I thought you didn't drink or use colipsum. It's funny how all that tends to just, pfft, out the window when you're dying. - You're not going to die. - Yes, he is. Yes, I am. Please hold. Thank you. Now, when were you infected? It was, uh, two nights past. There was an outbreak at the camp. Is it just me or is it really hot down here? It's very hot down here. The fermenting ale gives off heat. - Ah! - Does it hurt when I prod you - with a needle like that? - Yes. What does that mean? - I don't know. - Well, why did you do it then? Just collecting data. - Open wide. - Ahh. Ahh, ahh. Thank you. Hmm. I don't see anything, although I guess I should have known that already, because you were only stung two days ago and I guess the soonest anyone turns Plagueling is three days after infection, although some take up to six days. So that's how long we have to find a cure. There is no cure, Talon. Well, you don't know if you don't try. Well, hold on now. Not everyone who's stung actually turns, right? Just one in 13, best I can figure. Don't like those odds. Go get Gwynn. I should say goodbye. - Yes, go and get Gwynn. - No, you go and get Gwynn. - Why me? - Go. Do not touch her. Okay. Come on. Talon, you are the only person that I can trust to kill me. N... no. - Janzo will figure this out. - Maybe. But if not, you have to kill me if I turn. All right? Promise me that you'll put a blade through my mouth. I need you to give me your word. You have my word. But only when I'm sure you're gone. Tomorrow we reach Gallwood Outpost, where we will hunt down a creature resembling a woman. In her veins runs blood blacker than coal. Your orders are to spill the blood of every breathing thing until she is dead at my feet. Tell your men. You think I'm obsessed. The prophecy says that when the Blackblood rises, death and pestilence will fly over the land like ashes in the wind. So we have to do whatever is necessary, yes? She must die, for the sake of the living. Enjoying the view? Does a body good to get some fresh air, see the world from a new vantage point. It's a good way to think about your future. What future? I'm a prisoner just like you. Just like me? 11 years I've been down here, pinky. You're nothing like me. What good is all that money you make in smuggling when you're stuck down here in this rathole? And you and me both know you smuggle contraband in and out of the Outpost. What you moving? Arms? Weapons? Precious stones or minerals you find down here in the mines? They took your badge. Might be time to let it go. Yeah. You got a point there. Do me a favor. Thank the Mistress for me. Tell her I really did... you know. Love her? Care for her. Care for her. I can't let you leave. I gave the Foreman my word that you'd be back by light, - and I keep my word. - Not my problem. Now can we talk like adults? Why are you so invested in keeping me down here? 'Cause if you suddenly leave, there'll be questions. An investigation. How did he get out? Is there a back way out of the mine? Again, not my problem. No. But it is the Mistress's problem. You'll give away her best route, helping to make a nice case against her. I see what you're saying. So now, what's all this about how you care about her? All right. I'll stick around down here... for now. I was hoping you'd see it that way. That was my best knife. Hello. You're the barkeep, aren't you? Brewer, actually. I have a message for you, your ladyship. It's a private message. He told me that no one else is allowed to know. He? He who? - You know where Garret is? - Now hang on a minute. I didn't tell you who sent me. There's absolutely no... Tell me everything you know. - Is he all right? - No, m'lady. - What? - He's not okay. He's dying. - You should have water. - Thank you. My sweet Garret. - Not too close. - Why? - I'm infected, Gwynn. - You're infected? He's been stung by a Plagueling. - Well, cure him! - There is no cure. Look, the best I can figure is that there is a parasite gestating deep down inside of his throat or his stomach somewhere. Then, as it grows, the parasite will grow these long tentacles, and the tentacles will grow and they'll start to creep all the way up inside of his brain. Damn it, Janzo! There must be something you can do. Can't you just kill the creature before it grows? That's not a bad idea, actually. You know, I've never seen an infected person where they haven't turned Plagueling before. Hey, maybe if we give him some acid to drink... - What? No! - No. No, that would definitely kill him, yes. If he dies, you're next. He's going to die anyway. Janzo, it's not what she wants to hear. Look, if he has any chance of surviving, I cannot hide the truth in order to avoid hurting her feelings. And I cannot operate on him when madam over here is threatening me with my life. He's right, Gwynn. - You should go. - You summoned me here. I just wanted to say goodbye, you know, while... while I'm still me. No, I'm not going. I'm not going anywhere until the barkeep cures you. Brewer! I am a brewer! And the chance of a cure is unlikely. Gwynn, I cannot risk you getting infected yourself, and I do not want you to remember me in this condition. All right? So, please, we have to say goodbye. - You have to go. - Garret. I'm not going, Garret. Garret, I love you. I do love you. All right? Now go, please? - Go on. Please. - No. Talon? - Go, Gwynn. - No. - Yes. - Come with me. I'll take you. For many years, I've been afraid of losing Garret. I mean, he is a soldier after all, but... over the years I just convinced myself he was invincible. Don't give up yet. If anyone can beat this, Janzo can. - It's funny, isn't it? - What? How so alike we both are, you and I. We're nothing alike. Oh, but we are, Talon. We're both women in an Outpost full of men. Both of our families were murdered by the Prime Order. We both possess powers we wish we didn't have. We both have a destiny that will most likely be the death of us. And we both have feelings for Garret. What? I don't. The thought of losing him hurts you just as much as it hurts me. - I should go. - No, Talon. It means a great deal that you're here comforting me. I mean it when I say I want us to be friends. Whatever happens. We'll get through this together for now. And if he survives, we'll sort it out then. - Thank you. - Thank you, Talon. I'll keep you informed about Garret. Please do. I can't watch that. Okay, just a bit more. It burns. T... Talon? It's probably a good idea for him to rest a little bit. - So will this cure him? - No idea. The mute watchman's here to see you, m'lady. Send him in. Leave. Danno? Is that your name? You can call off the search. I found Captain Spears. Why do you bow as if I'm some sort of royalty? You and Wythers were very close. Who better than you to hold on to some letters for him to send on on his behalf should something befall him? No? You deny it? You can't speak, but I presume you can write. And yet, you've made no demands, no threats. You could be biding your time. Or you really could have no intention of doing anything with the secret you possess. They say that the Prime Order Chancellor burned your throat with a red hot iron because you protested when he forced himself on your young wife. We want the same thing, you and I. We both want revenge on the Prime Order. You will be my eyes and ears. Anything the Watch knows, I want to know. Agreed? And Danno? Together we will have our revenge. Janzo? Come here. Is this what I think it is? That's it. That's the Vex Rezicon. The Book of Names, Talon! You found it. And it says right here it's kept in some kind of temple. The Shrine... Shrine Maer-Nokh? - Where's that? - Wait. Wait. Maer-Nokh, Maer-Nokh. I'll find it. It's here somewhere. Let me see. This one. - Maer-Nokh. - What kind of map is this? - Nothing looks familiar. - Mm, nor to me. Wait. See how this road makes an "S" between the two mountain peaks? Mm-hmm. That's the border front at Hadrion's Pass. - Are you sure? - I've been there twice. This map must be from ages ago. All the roads are different. If you're right about this, Talon, then that means that the temple is... Deep in greyskin territory. Which is awful news. It's actually good news. The greyskins don't care about this book, Janzo, which means it's probably still there. - I'm going after it. - What? Across leagues of flesh-eating greyskin territory? - Yes. - I'll go. You're awake. How are you feeling? Sober. And like I just had acid poured down my throat. That wasn't acid. Acid would have killed you. He's so dramatic. It was dumbcane. Rodent poison. - Did it work? - No idea. Talon, just wait. It wasn't enough to kill you. Just enough to kill something the size of a parasite living inside of you. Maybe. Probably not, but maybe. Janzo, do you have any idea how to actually save me? - Close to zero. - This is just a waste of time. - I'm going with Talon. - So you can infect me? I don't think so. I'm going alone. No, hey, you need that book to help us defeat the Prime Order. Now, I have at least two days. There is still time. Please, just... let me do some small good before I die. - Then I'm coming with you. - No. I'm the only one who can translate the script, and nobody else knows about Plaguelings as well as I do. - You need me. - Janzo, you don't have to come. What? I'm not letting you go with a Plagueling alone. - Hey! - Fine. - So when do we leave? - Now. The longer you have me, the further you'll get. Cocky for a dying man. Hmm. Supper. I don't understand why we can't just walk around and walk through the gates like normal people. Because the Outpost blocks the passage so that the greyskins can't get into our territory. That means we can't get into theirs from that side either. The only way over is this wall. Garret! Wait, Garret! - Let's go. - Garret! - You go ahead. - No, it's all right. I... I'll just stay here w-with you! Gwynn. I was just about to leave. Why do you have to go on this silly little trip? We should be spending our last hours together, not apart. I am doing this for you, to help Talon get the names to aid in your battle. Our battle. I'm sorry. Very soon it likely won't be. - It's not safe. - I don't care. I have to go. I'm so sorry. I have to go. Come back to me. It's a big wall. I'm surprised men could build such a thing. Oh, men didn't build that. No, no, no. That was there before men arrived. - What? greyskins? - Mm-hmm. Some say Lu-Qiri. I doubt that. Forgetting your pack? Right. We've got to chain Garrett up. He could turn at any moment. It's barely been three days. We don't know exactly what the gestation period is. He's right. It's better to be safe. Chain me up. Don't slow us down. I won't. Don't think I've ever been more thirsty in my entire life. Hopefully one of these days we'll get some sleep. How you feeling? Do you feel infected? Perhaps my parasite will die of thirst before I do. It has been four days, though. You should probably sleep with a sword tonight. I don't want to kill you. Yes, well... you may feel differently when I'm at your throat. What is that? It's a watchtower. Looks like an old checkpoint. I've seen one of them before with greyskins on it. They do have barrels, though. Was it ale or... or water? What do greyskins drink? Oh, whatever it is, I'm drinking it all. - It looks deserted. - So what do we do? - We go in. - Are you sure? Yep. I'll lead. Just dirt. Why would they be storing dirt? It's bait. Unchain me, now! Come on, come on! Sword! Awesome. Aah! Ow. My ankle. Argh! What was that stuff you dumped on the greyskin that burned him so bad? - Acid. - Where did you get acid from? - Brought it with me. - Why? - It doesn't matter. - Yes, it does. - Tell me why you brought acid. - To try on you once you turned. It was only to see if it would kill the Plagueling parasite. - That's all. - So that was your plan then? Just pour acid all over me. Burn the flesh off my bones, like you did the greyskin. No, of course not, Garret. Don't be so silly. I was going to pour it down your throat. - Oh. - You'd have been a goner anyway and... and you wouldn't have felt it. I don't think. Maybe. Perhaps. I don't know. I, for one, am glad he brought acid. He saved our lives. He's my hero. Re... really? And how are you feeling? I don't feel any little creature down my throat or stomach, if that's what you mean. Then perhaps Janzo's rat poison worked. Doubt it. Just don't tend to be that lucky, that's all. Well, it's probably best if you tie me up tonight. Is that what you say to all the girls? What about you? How are your ribs? Don't worry about her. She'll heal overnight. She's Blackblood, remember? It's not that I heal fast. You both heal slow. - Is that comfortable? - Quite. - Don't look at me like that. - Like what? Like other men do. You know, this may be my last night alive. Surely, Gwynn commanded you to keep your distance. As a matter of fact... I don't believe she did. Sorry, I... I don't want you to get infected. Oh, is that what it is? Hmm. Still don't see anything. Well, isn't he a constant source of disappointment? You know, I am rather cold. Does that mean anything? Yes. It means it's a very harsh desert. It's burning hot in the day and freezing cold at night. Here. Have these extra blankets. It's probably his last night alive. The least you can do is make the pretty boy feel comfortable. Well then, I need your body warmth. You're doing this just to get under his skin, aren't you? - What makes you say that? - Well, is it true? 'Cause if it is, it's incredibly cruel. To him or you? I'm not sure if you're aware, but, um, you're an exceptionally beautiful girl, and you're... you're pressing your... against my back. Now, I just happen to be a male of the species, and, so, natural reactions are, um, going to be inevitable. - Did you want me to stop? - No. - And by the way. - Hmm? It's not only to get under his skin. I am really freezing. Right. Yes, um... It is very cold, isn't it? Milord, an army of Covenant soldiers - not a league from the gate. - How many? I reckon ten score, with cavalry. Don't open the gates until I'm there. - Do you understand me? - Aye. Closed. Fall in. Gwynn. Gwynn! What's going on? There's a Covenant battalion at the gates. - You must hide. - Have they come for me? I'm not sure. So, just go hide, all right? All right, good. Ambassador Dred. What brings you to this far-flung corner of the world? Commander Calkussar, why are your gates shut to me? Gates are always closed at night against our enemies, Plaguelings. But surely you do not see us as your enemies. Of course not, Ambassador. Though I had begun to wonder when my Covenant patrol did not return. They never returned? We sent them on their way, well fed, well rested. Did you now? These are dangerous lands, Ambassador. It's not uncommon for patrols to be attacked by bandits, bone wolves, Plaguelings, and such, especially after nightfall. We have many fascinating things to discuss, Commander. But must we shout to one another all morning? My men are tired from their ride. Open your gates, and show us the hospitality we deserve. Of course, Ambassador. You're always welcome here. Open the gates. We need to leave. - Pack up my things. - What's going on? Just do as I say. Ambassador, welcome to the Outpost. My men will take care of your horses, we'll arrange for your lodging, and perhaps you would care... No! No! Anyone loyal to Calkussar dies today. I want Calkussar's daughter here now, dead or alive! And find me that Blackblood! Hyah! Hyah!
