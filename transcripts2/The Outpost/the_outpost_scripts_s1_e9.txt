 Previously on "The Outpost"... There is a book full of names. I want it destroyed. That's the Vex Rezicon, the Book of Names. Talon, you found it. And it says right here it's kept in Shrine Maer-Nokh. See how this road makes an "S" between the two mountain peaks? The border front at Hadrion's Pass. I'm going after it. Across leagues of flesh-eating greyskin territory? You need that book to help us defeat the Prime Order. Now I have at least two days. There is still time. You will be sent to the mines to pay for your crime.

 Tomorrow we reach Gallwood Outpost. We will hunt down a creature resembling a woman. Anyone loyal to Calkussar dies today. And find me that Blackblood! You didn't turn. - Unchain me. - Why didn't you turn? I really need to relieve myself. He's been infected for four days already. Janzo! Unchain me immediately or I will go on you right here, right now. He's ever so dramatic, isn't he? Open it up. Ahh. - Still nothing. - Clearly! Unchain me. Talon. Hello, Talon.

 Thank you. Ah! It can take upwards of six days, but... but usually the vast majority of people would have been infected by now. So if he lasts two more days, he's not infected? Not necessarily. Maybe. Wish I knew more. Oh, wow. You're really afraid you're going to lose him, aren't you? - No. - You really love him. We need him, in case you didn't notice. Why? Because of yesterday? Beg your pardon, but I think you'll find that I was the hero yesterday. You were. Very good. Sorry, what was that? Nothing. Let's chain him up. No, we need him in case we need to fight. Well, what if he's the one that we need to be fighting? Well, if I can beat him when he's himself, I'm sure I can beat him when he's a Plagueling. - Really? - Mm-hmm. Do you actually think you can be... - Do you want to be chained up? - What I want is to find that book before I turn. Now, are you going to chain me... or are you not? - I'm not. - Very good. Let's go, then. What are we waiting for? "Book of Names." It's so damn hot. My lips are more cracked than this ground. Did any one of you bring extra water? You told us not to bring extra water, that we'd be traveling alongside a river. This is a river. Just not at this time of year, apparently. So tell me, what is that dragon man thing you two keep talking about? It's a Dragman, Garret. It's a Dragman. Not a dragon man, a Dragman. - Ever heard the term? - Well, obviously not. If he had, he wouldn't have called it a dragon man, would he? So what is it then? It's coming to find me, whatever that means. I've been translating the smith's books, and wherever there's mention of the Book of Names, there's also mention of the Dragman. This way. Water! Water! Ha! Right. I'm coming. Janzo. Well done, Janzo. Wait, something's not right here. Why don't the greyskins have a settlement here? We're right by a water source. Um, uh, uh. Um, you need to get out. - What? - Um, you need to get out. Get out! Where did he go, Janzo? My very educated guess is it's a Teraprock. - What is that? - It means get out, Talon! - No way. - No, don't! Talon? Garret? No, no, no, no. Oh, thank the gods. Garret, here. Get it off of him. Take one, Talon. You sawed off the tentacles with that little dagger? Garret, breathe! Talon, what are you doing? Talon, what are you doing? Nordijorian clerics say it can bring someone back to life. Do the clerics also say that they could kiss people back to life? You've got to be kidding me. Are you all right? I feel like a horse kicked me in the chest. I dreamt that you kissed me. That she kissed you back to life. Guess what? She did. How incredibly romantic. You know, those ten tentacled Teraprocks, they can come this far, so you may want to take your little staring competition elsewhere. Aah! You dove right in after him. I just stood there. There was nothing else you could do. Otherwise you would have. I'm a coward. Cowards don't come deep into greyskin territory to help their best friend. Best friend? Greyskins. - Garret, greyskins. - Come on, we need to go. Ambassador Dred. What have you found? Oh, relax, Talon. It's just from all the water I swallowed. I'm not a Plagueling. Not yet. I've been thinking. I don't actually know much about you. All right. What would you like to know? - Well, your father is Wythers. - Mm-hmm. What about your mother? Well, my mother was a washer woman. Died when I was very young. - I'm sorry. - It's all right. So Wythers raised you alone? Me and my older brother Jaelon, yes. You have a brother? Be a couple of years older than me. We'd get into so much mischief when we were younger. Never any good at it, but that didn't stop us. There was one instance in particular. Jaelon had stolen a case of wine for us from one of the quartermasters. Caught right away. And my father sent him down to the lowest mineshaft. It was only meant to be a day or two. Idea was to teach him a lesson, I don't know. Except that he was now surrounded by all the criminals that my father had arrested. Oh, no. And hours into that first day in the mine, my brother Jaelon was beaten to death. I'm sorry. I didn't know. That's all right. So that's why you left the Outpost. That was when I enlisted in the Prime Order, yes. It was the one thing my father hated more than anything else. The only trouble was I didn't realize how quickly I would grow to hate them even more than he did, if that's possible. So you came back? Mm, Commander Calkussar summoned me back. I was tasked with the responsibility of protecting Gwynn. Why you? He knew he could trust me with her safety. Gwynn and I, we grew up together. We played together as children. We were friends. She wasn't a little girl anymore, was she? No. No, she wasn't. And I wasn't that scrawny little boy who had run away. So why come? Why leave Gwynn? I'm infected. I don't want to be anywhere near Gwynn. Why else? Protect you. Help you find the book. - For Gwynn? - For the entire Realm, Talon. I mean, the things that you can do, the things that you are capable of can shift the entire balance of power. So that's why you're helping me. 'Cause it's part of your mission. No, I cannot let anything happen to you. Why? Because Gwynn needs me? I am here, Talon, because I want to be here. With you. Are you two coming or not? - Coming. - Yes. Find Calkussar's daughter and bring her to me. Get over here! Quit complaining. Line up! This trench should bring us right past the Shrine and hopefully hide us from greyskins along the way. Janzo! Ahh! They're barbaric. This is what life is like in most of the Realm. Where I'm from, anyways. Where are you from? The Capital. Mimm's Burrow. Mimm's Burrow... I remember that place when I was a child. I wasn't permitted to go there, though. Not surprised. It's where the poorest of the poor live. It was very bad under your father. Oh. I'm sorry. Keep searching. Cut every hand until we find her. But it's much worse under the Prime Order. Well, poverty will be one of the first things we solve when I get there. I hope you can, miss. But first we need to get you to safety. I'll go find help. No! No, it's too dangerous. Your life is more important than my own. I misjudged you, Naya. You're brave. There is a watchman named Danno, the one that can't speak. He is loyal to me. Maybe he can help. Thank you. Get out of here! We're done. Those Covenant bastards. Who would have thought they'd be bad for business? Gluttony, debauchery, greed. They're the three pillars of the Prime Order, aren't they? I think it's, uh, loyalty, purity, strength. Munt, shut up! What the blazes? You, stay quiet. Come on. Hurry up. I want all women to line up with your hands out, palms up. You heard what he said. Now. Come on. Bring that wench. Ambassador. Welcome. Uh, can I get you a drink? Shut your mouth and get in line. Next. Ambassador, maybe if you could tell me what it is that you're looking for, perhaps I could help. I am looking for a woman with black blood. If you know who she is, you could save all of these women a lot of pain. Well, I don't. And it's not me. Aah! You may have been somebody special before we got here, but now... you're nobody. Destroy every bottle and every barrel. I don't like your business, and I don't much like you. This swill makes a man forget his place. I want this Outpost dry, and keep cutting every woman until we find the Blackblood. Take her upstairs. Leave us. How is it that you failed to mention in all your correspondence that the lady you serve is a surviving royal? I only learned it recently. Do you know where she is? First give me a way to free my sister and mother. If what you tell me leads to her capture, then yes, I will free them. It will. She's like a rat in a cage. Naya? Hello, princess. - You swore to help me! - Shh. - Touch me, I'll scream. - You talk too much. You're gonna get us all killed. Wait. What's happening? Greyskins. They believe that leaving the body of a dead enemy is a waste of food. - Are you saying...? - They're going to eat us. - But I don't want to be eaten. - Nor do I. So maybe you should think of something quickly to get us out of this. I've barely even lived. I've... I've never seen the ocean. I... I... I've never been with a woman before. - What? Never? - Never? It's colipsum. Interesting. I knew colipsum came from greyskins, but... What? When did you figure that out? - Long story. - Maybe you should have some. Might make this whole thing a little less unpleasant. I do not use colipsum. Neither do I. Oh, that's another thing I haven't done, colipsum. Wait. Why are they only offering it to him? Why aren't they offering it to us? He can smell it on your blood. What? He can sense the Plagueling venom. You're not going to get eaten 'cause you're a Plagueling. How lucky is your bloody life? Lucky? No! Go. No, no. Stop! No, you don't want to eat me. Stop! Please don't eat me! I haven't washed for weeks. Talon, we are running out of options. Oh, I hate this. Talon, come and help me! Talon! - Come on. - That's magnificent. - Janzo, come! - Go! Wait. Talon, come on. Before they turn their attention back on us. Talon, are you all right? I sent him to his death. You could say that, or you could say that it sacrificed its life to save ours. It didn't have a choice. It had to obey me. Talon, it's not exactly... I mean, it killed innocent people. He saved my life more than once. That's it. Shrine Maer-Nokh. We can get there by morning. Oh, well done. Well done. You hear that, Talon? We'll have you more demon names before you know it. More names will lead to more killing. Talon, it saved our lives. Now with more of them, we can take back the Realm. We can free the people. Talon, listen to me. You promised the smith that you would find the book, but in finding the book doesn't mean that you have to use it. - You said that yourself. - We cannot turn back now. Come on. I told her to stay here. Take three squads, search these tunnels. Find her and bring her to me. My patience has expired with you. I'll find another way to be useful. I swear it. Oh, I'm sure you will, or your mother and sister will pay the price. You are dead. Quiet! Be quiet, will you? Aah! Damn you, bitch! Get her. You think I'd make it easy for you to get your revenge? To kill me or whatever your plan is? I'm not gonna kill you, not that I haven't thought about breaking every scrawny bone in your body since you put me down in this hellhole. Well, then, you're selling me to Dred? No, princess. I'm helping you escape. Why didn't you just say that in the first place? 'Cause you wouldn't shut your piehole long enough. Would you? Come on, Danno, move. This is Sill. She'll smuggle you out of here. Sill, this is Lady Calkussar, or Queen Rosmund, take your pick. Your Majesty, forgive me if I don't kneel or bow or whatever it is that you do for disenfranchised royalty. A little hard on the old knees. And I'm supposed to trust her? No, she's not to be trusted. She's a crook. But she's predictable, which is just as good, ain't it? Um, no. No, it's not. Why would you help me? Gold. And favors. For that, you could sell me to the Prime Order. They might give me gold, but most likely, they'd just kill both of us. Then what do you want? A head's weight in gold, and my freedom. If and when you're in power, you can give it to me. We've already searched down there. They're searching for her down the mine. Come on. We're running out of time. It looks like I don't have much choice. - I agree to your demands. - Oh, good. Let's go. - There's nowhere to go. - But there is. - I'll never make that. - I've smuggled hundreds of swords and armored suits across this wall. I can damn sure smuggle a bag of bones like you. Let's go. - Marshal. - I'm not a marshal anymore. I don't deserve to be. We'll talk about that along the way. Oh, I'm not coming. You must. The Outpost is my home. I was born here. My father and my father's father were born here. I can't just let those bastards take it. I understand. Gwynn... Your Majesty. If I don't make it through this mess... and you happen to see Garret alive... tell him... I'll tell him. - Which way are we going? - This way. Look busy. Don't come any closer. We've been infected. Is there another way out of this chamber? It's a dead end. I mean, why do you think they stick Plaguelings like us down here? Plaguelings? - Come on, let's go. - Come on, move. Hurry! I found some more wenches in need of indoctrination. More loot, sir. Add it to the pile. Looks like you'll leave here a rich man, Ambassador. Funny. I spent my whole life in the wrong career. Robbery's so much more lucrative. Spoils of war liberated from traitors, I hardly call that robbery. There's plenty of my gold in that pile. How am I a traitor? All my life I've done nothing but serve the Realm, fed its soldiers, kept them entertained. Gambling, drinking, and whoring. Those are expressly forbidden. It was your soldiers that turned this house into whoring. Whoring is when you pay for services. Has any money changed hands? Spoils of war. - How do they taste? - What? Those boots you're licking. - If you think you're too old... - Marshal! I'm eating. Next time, Mistress. There won't be a next time, Higgs. Well, it's not exactly the most inviting place I've seen. We won't be here long. Let's go. Talon. The Vex Rezicon. The book of denomination, by Lord Yannu Metahkken Rino Faxtinus Leitch. - It's gone. - But only just recently. Why? Who? Well, it can't be a coincidence. We almost died, multiple times, for nothing. All those names lost. So now what? We just give up and go back to the Outpost? No. Someone built a shrine for this book. But then why would they make the book itself so fragile? Wait, what is this? Could this be the Dragman? Except the smith said the Dragman will find you, not you will find it. Well, whatever it is, must be important for someone to hide it so well. Maybe the book was a decoy, another layer of protection. Talon... I think that this is the Vex Rezicon, the Book of Names. But if that's the book, then how do we read it? Come on. Down here. Quiet. Shh. - Keep it down. - All right. This is madness. What do you hope to accomplish? We take back the Nightshade. - And then what? - We take back the Outpost. And after that? Then the Prime Order will send more armies to kill us all. Good. So you've thought it through. We're as good as dead either way. Listen, I have lived through changes in command. I have survived war. I've survived famine. I've outlived my enemies. Men come and go, but I mind my business and I survive! - This is different, Elinor! - How? Dred don't want your libations, or your colipsum. Trust me, he's not gonna spare you 'cause you bake a good cake. You grew up here like me. Are you gonna let those Prime Order bags of scum take our home without a fight? All right. What you got in mind? That's more like it. Right. Come on. Something doesn't make sense. The Prime Order obviously went to a lot of trouble and expense to burn that book. Why under the gods aren't you turning Plagueling? That's what I don't understand. Why would they go to all that trouble to burn the book instead of just keeping it for themselves? It has no value to them. Only a Blackblood can use it. They just want to keep it from me. Right, but wouldn't it be easier just to kill you? They tried to. They sent the Bones, remember? And I wasn't so easy to kill. But Dred went through a lot of trouble to find and burn that book, didn't he? Now, surely he would go through just as much trouble to find and kill you. And what? Send an army? They could be marching on the Outpost as we speak. I have to warn Gwynn. - Where's Dred? - Moved into Calkussar's house. What do you want? Oh, just his throat slit, that's all. I guess you'll do. This is treason. You'll all be hanged. Well, I guess you'll never know. Aah! Good boy, Munt. Oi, oi, listen up. All right? There's about a hundred of the bastards out there. They're well-armed and they're well-trained. Yeah. That's right. That's right. Some would say we don't stand a chance in a fair fight, so we don't give them a fair fight. We wait till the moon is high, and we take them out one by one, soul by soul, from the next to the next to the next. Are you with me? This is our only chance, okay? Let's have it. Now come on, look lively. Let's go. Cut them off so there's no escape.
