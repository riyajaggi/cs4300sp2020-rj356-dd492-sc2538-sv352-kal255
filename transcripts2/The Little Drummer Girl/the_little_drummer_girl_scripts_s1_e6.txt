  Previously on  "The Little Drummer Girl"... When you showed me that boy  Michel, did you know you were going  to murder him? -Yes.  -Why didn't you tell me? We needed a genuine  performance. It will verify  your story now. Report upwards.  You're in this fight whether you  like it or not. -Boom!  -She has crossed a line God straighted.  -No, no, no, no, no, please!

 become one. Welcome, Charlie. I am Fatmeh. ♪♪ Salim was captured once  by the Jordanians. -And he was proud of it.  -Why? Because he was taken in  with Khalil. It was in the evening,  he said. A convoy of jeeps  came into the camp and they grabbed Khalil first,  then Salim. Then they beat Khalil down. Took off his shoes and made Salim hold his feet whilst they whipped them. And?

That's Captain Tayeh  in the jeep. He sets the rules  of the camp. If you break the rules,  you will be executed. ♪♪ Why has Rossino  been in London? Legal offices, a polytechnic,  a synagogue, some houses. -Targets? -They can't all be targets. There's something else  linking them. Guess what? The Valkyrie's back  in town, too. Our good friend  Helga -- she met with Mesterbein  yesterday. But still no word  on Charlie. I'm sorry, everyone. It looks like we will be staying in this dank little country  a while longer.

Captain Tayeh is training you  to be nothing. To need nothing. You are the armor-piercing shell  that will break the Western oppressor's heart. This method gives one  hour from the time we set it.

A factory worker. She hasn't moved since. She's not on their lists,  or ours. And what about our other two beauties? Rossino's  still in the UK, and it looks like Helga's  shacked up with him. Isn't this handwriting familiar to you, Mr. Schwilli? Michel's apartment. One to Germany, one to France. Who is communicating here? Mesterbein, of course. He wrote it. Who created it?

"Défense" for the French  postcard, "Vergiss"  for the German one. Which translate to "defense"  and "forget." Progress. But they're still  meaningless. What's he after here? This isn't about killing  for him. It's about the show. They're preparing Charlie  for something. For what? Marty? Bodies are still being counted, but an Israeli journalist attending the conference  in Lyon today with his family is believed  to have been the main tar-- Ask the French  if there was a wire doll. We're fools! Khalil has another cell. Now, if you want a return  on your investment -- So I'm the schmuck,  the money-man. Martin Kurtz  is the talent! We're getting closer! Do you really think  bombing a few camps is going to  stop him now? They are bombing us,  Marty! Charlie is in Lebanon. She is on the inside. Where? Well, then. Wouldn't he expect a response to this attack? And if it doesn't come, won't that make him suspicious? I answer to the people, Marty.  Not you. - Noah? It's Gadi. D-- ♪♪ Ah, oui. Thank you.

Your diary. You do not love Salim. You love his death. They are  the same thing now. Yeah. Maybe. People in our world,  Charlie, they will be  drawn to you... because you can lie. Because you have a pretty white face and a clean passport. I brought you here  because I want you to be true. How was he,  the last time you saw him? Please? ♪♪ Honestly? Yeah. ♪♪ He was vulnerable, and he could barely move. Why? ♪♪ Oh.  I see. You and he  had a fantastic night. I understand. I understand. ♪♪ ♪♪ We found a new postcard,  Gadi. We got it from Rossino's flat. He collected it from a PO Box  yesterday. And now England. What? Stop! I'm trying. Okay. Oh, you find me funny, too,  do you? I'm trying. No. No. You are 'armalat alshahid. We respect that. What's --  What's that? Um, a-a martyr's widow. -Oh.  -We are, too, in a way. Yasir and I. And we're glad  you have come.

"The Catastrophe." -Or --  -"Disaster." ♪♪ -Who started all this?  -The British. Now, Khalil isn't  attacking people. He's attacking ideas. The theater of the real. He needs people's attention because without an audience,  there's nothing. Khalil is a showman. Helga, Rossino. They're in England.  -Yes. What about Charlie? A British girl  on British soil. He won't be able  to resist. The other postcards broke down  to two words, "Defense" and "Forget." And both victims  were ideologues. The journalist in Lyon, Rosen,  he was set to give a speech. "Défense Offensive." "Défense." Bad Godesberg. Fineberg's uncle,  the scholar -- He was writing about Germany, about the Holocaust. W-W-What was the name  of his new book? -"Vergiss Nicht."  -"Never forget." ♪♪ So, to sum up. First, the date -- the word  "Disaster" gives us Al Nakba. The anniversary's  on the 15th of May. Second, the location -- the British are responsible  for Al Nakba. Britain. ♪♪ The Israelis  will strike back. Without a response, we are just  a few Arabs in the dust. ♪♪ Don't you understand? For the Palestinians  even to exist, we must lift  the world up by the neck. Third, the target -- thinkers,  so they wound us more deeply. And when they strike back, we will strike back again, and again, and again. ♪♪ Yes. The anniversary of Al Nakba  is in three days' time. We look for any event  on the 15th -- anything that might  tie to disaster, catastrophe,  independence, Al Nakba. Anything even close! ♪♪ Gadi, I want you  to take another look at the sites Rossino visited. ♪♪ ♪♪ I am at the Polytechnic  of Greater London. An Israeli professor  is holding a talk here on the anniversary  of Al Nakba. The word "Disaster" is in  the title of her lecture. Why not have a flashing light  and a siren, too? Oh, play nicely,  Shimon. It's our ball,  but their court. He's been looking forward  to this, you know, sir. Immensely. This way, sir. Mr. Raphael, meet Captain Meadows. Captain Meadows,  meet Mr. Raphael. From Tel Aviv. An honor, sir, actually. Fine moustache. Hmm. I knew a Raphael once. Some shit-heap town in the Golan Heights. You were probably just a kid back then. Fighting with the Irgun,  no doubt, like your mucker Gavron. Anton Mester-been. Mesterbein. He runs a legal practice  out of Zurich, from which  he offers representation to a variety of  rather radical organizations. Who's the woman? Frau Astrid Berger, alias Edda Schmidt. Currently going by  Helga Stern. No Mesterbein on the magic box,  sir, sorry, not even a POI. Well, we've moved on, Meadows. Astrid Berger, Edda Schmidt,  Helga Stern. Your ignorance here  is no reflection on your excellent  records department, Commander. Until a short time ago, we were also unaware  of Mesterbein's dalliances. What enlightened you? Well,  that one I know. He's the genius who scored  an own-goal on the Munich autobahn,  yes? Same chap we pointed out to you  at that poxy forum. And we were very grateful,  too. Because since then,  our sources have revealed that all of these players  are part of the same cell. And now they're all holidaying  in England, hmm? Hmm. Do you know anything about an English bird, Charmian Ross? She was  at that forum, too. Last seen crossing all sorts of unfamiliar borders in a car not dissimilar  to that driven by your toasty  Arab friend there. Now we have Mossad agents  crawling all over London. Hell of a coincidence,  don't you think? -Hmm.  -Mm. NRA on Berger, Stern,  or Schmidt, either, Sir. For God's sake,  Meadows. This picture was taken  by a lucky chance in Greece. Oh, she's definitely  on our system, sir. We know her  from the forum, too. I am proud of you,  Meadows. I think Mr. Raphael and I  could do with a breath of English fresh air. Get all that from that kraut ninny Dr. Alexis, did you? I am told he has been  a most accommodating ally. Oh, yeah? Funny. The only Israeli he said he'd dealt with was a "Schulmann." Had a little whippet, never caught the name. Do you know any Schulmanns,  Mr. Raphael? You see, it's one thing  to piss on my leg and tell me  that it's raining. It's quite another to take  a bloody great shit all over me without the courtesy of a weather report. ♪♪ Come off it. Operation Mincemeat,  we invented that. Find a corpse, stuff it with disinformation, leave it somewhere for the enemy to find. I have a hunch, though,  that you clever lot have taken it  one step further. No dead meat to hand so you find yourselves some nice fresh meat  and bumf! Blow it up  in a Mercedes. And now they've bitten. I bet you're chuffed  to the bullocks with yourselves,  aren't you? Yeah. On my desk, Williams,  please. ♪♪ ♪♪ I am ready. ♪♪ Whenever you say. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ We let them in? And let them explode the bomb.  Yes. In my bloody country? An attack you can control is  better than one you concede. Who says we conceded? The Irish.  The UVF. Anyone who tries their luck. You will be given full credit for any success we have. Public acclaim. Yeah, and all the crap  when it goes wrong. Go on, on you go.  Chop, chop, chop. chop, chop,  chop, chop, chop! Do you know,  back in '47, when I was still  a junior, we took in this little Israeli shit for questioning. The same town in the Golan Heights. A gang of kids had been taking  pot shots at my men, you see. And I was sure that this boy  was a weak link, sure he'd spill the names. But the harder I pushed,  the quieter he got. Nearly broke  my bloody hand. But he didn't  breathe a word. Not one name. When I let him go, I thought to myself, "God, if I haven't made a little drummer boy right here, ready to bang his gong into the next battle they find for him, I don't know what I've done." Half the kids in that town went on to become Irgun. Bloody Zionist thugs. Next year they marched into the Palestinian village of Deir Yassin. Most vicious slaughter  I've ever seen. Gadi was right,  Marty. It's Professor Minkel. Rossino's locations  were all hers. Every one  is on her itinerary. He went to the library  she's visiting, the café  she's holding interviews in. They're looking for the best moment to approach. Does anyone have  an aspirin? ♪♪ A woman fitting Charlie's description was seen boarding in Beirut airport  this morning.

I heard you were wonderful,  you know. Even Tayeh  was impressed. Have you met him? Khalil? No one meets him. Just Tayeh  and his family. Why don't you come to bed  with Mario and me. You need to relax so you can  get a good sleep for tomorrow. You sound like my mum. You don't like your mother,  Charlie? Um, well, it's more her that's not too keen on me, to be honest. I'm tired, Helga. Then we shall  blow them all up. These English  you hate so much. Yes? Yeah, why not? Why do you think we brought you  back here, Charlie? She seemed fine. She looked cute,  actually. I think she's playing  a character.

Yes, I can hear you fine. ♪♪ -Now.  -No. You tell me  you know that lady. No one can hear us. ♪♪ I think  I know that lady. Really?  Which lady? Professor Minkel? I'm -- I'm so sorry  to trouble you. My name is  Imogen Baastrup. I'm a graduate in social studies from the University of Durban. I was lucky enough to get your lecture last year on minority rights in racially determined societies. Anyway, I'm so sorry. I was wondering if  I could shake your hand? Professor Minkel's about  to have something to eat. It's alright. Thank you so much! How long are you staying here for? Just one night,  for the lecture. And you must come. Ah, no, I'm so sorry I can't make it tonight. I'm actually  visiting my cousin. Imogen! Alessio, look! This is the professor I was telling you about from Israel. How do you do. He's thrilled to meet you, even if he doesn't seem it. We both are. I have not stopped talking  about you for a year.

It'll make  a bigger impact. At the main event. Khalil's  building a narrative. They're splitting up,  Marty! They're splitting up! We need to follow them! No.  She'll be back. This is insane.  How do you know? Because  that's what I would do. We're losing them because you're slut-struck! We let her go! Marty! He will use cut-outs, drag us  around half the country.

There was no message in the cigarette packet. No contact. Hmm. The bracelet  on her right wrist? A new one.  Thread. Thread? She must have lost  the real thing. You bet all this on a piece of string? It was gold and blue. Come on! None of his other girls were  brought to Lebanon, after all. Because of our fiction, it is  an all-or-nothing game now. She is either a dead body  or a family member. She wove that bracelet. That is more precious for us  than gold, than lapis. Whatever happens,  you should be proud. ♪♪ Drink to our brothers in  the black sands of Palestine. ♪♪ ♪♪ What is this?

You're sure  they'll play ball? Mm. There've been enquiries into the Professor's schedule, yes? Some hack from  a pro-Israeli rag rang. Called himself  Hershovitz. Wanted to do a piece  on our professor's visit. And did the faculty give this Mr. Hershovitz her full schedule? Well,  what do you think? Has word spread about  the flood in the basement? We're not amateurs. Oh, well, thank you. When the dust settles, I don't want a whiff of you  or your kind. Not in the news, not in the official reports, not anywhere. And all your men  will be issued with these. My kind? Well, no one lies with a smile  on their face like your lot. And for the record, I don't like being handed this on a plate, least of all by you. I want them back. Charlie will be  in her element now. On stage. In her greatest role. Too great. You think  she's gone over? So, my sister says you're ready,  Charlie. Are you? If she has?

I asked Rachel  about the thread bracelet. She told me it was  black and white. But I guess it's still  on her right wrist. Thank you. We have to  use these. What do you think of this Professor Minkel? She wants peace. I think  she's a good person. Maybe she is. So why kill her? Because her hope  is a fantasy. I told Salim many times a woman cannot be trusted just because you go to bed with her. And what about a man? A man cannot be trusted  ever. Why did he  tell you my name? Because he loved me. And he loved you. I had three brothers,  you know. Now I have none. You have a family? You know. Do this just once, and you will always  have one. How did it feel, please, to kill the American traitor? I didn't kill him. You did. It was horrible. Good. If a man's life  is not significant, what is the point  in taking it? I am boring you? No. No. Sorry. It's nerves. It's the same with the theater when I'm about to go on. Feel like I could sleep  for 100 years. I feel that the Israelis  are close, you know? All the time. I imagine they have someone  moving the pieces to get to me, someone whose mind has been  carved away to obsession by his  decades of battle. He knows me,  but I don't know him. In my head,  I've made him into a devil, a Dybbuk from their texts. Because without that,  I wouldn't be afraid of him. Listen to me. I'm going on  like an old man. Did Salim like horses? They terrified him. Our grandfather had one. He had to sell it. Why? To buy a gun. You're too young  to be a widow. Professor Minkel begins speaking at 5:30. I shall set it for 5:30. And the hall  will be full. Yes. But maybe she will try the latch before. I have put a trigger there,  too. If the briefcase opens, it will explode  instantly. Always two things.
