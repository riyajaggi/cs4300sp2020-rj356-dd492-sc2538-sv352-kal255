 8:30 8:30. Hello. May I speak with Ucki, please? Hi, I'm Charmian, Charmian Ross. We're thrilled to meet you, Miss Ross, believe me. {\an8}He's different. I can feel it. - You don't kiss like... - With a smile, please. With his... He's different. I can feel it. You don't... Loving.

 He's different. Loving, Miss Ross. What's that meant to mean? Fewer teeth. Good. That anger, hold it and try something a little new. I want you to take the essence of the scene and make it your own. The other night I was in the pub with him... My mates too, and... And I was smiling along, playing snooker, pool, whatever, and I saw these pissed, old farts in the corner hassling this lady. Go and get Charlie, leave it to Charlie.

 I started a fight. I started a fight with this IDIOT in charge. Charlie. No. Do you know what a word like "Poof" means to him? - Chas. - And I shoved him, I shoved him, and he... He went flying and I, I felt... I threw up on the snooker table, Chas. They didn't even know I was gay. I felt so alive. Sorry. Johnny grabbed him and pulled him away from me and I saw him falling in love with me, infinitely, and he saw me burning inside. Oh, shit. And in that moment... His eyes were endless. I grabbed him the moment we got outside and he kissed me so hard that his teeth hit mine. Pleasure's the antidote to death, right? Two clocks, two batteries, yes? That's what this German said. They will tell us the attache was the target. We fly all the way from Israel for that. You think it was the uncle? The outspoken Talmudic scholar. Oh, as if there is any other kind. Yes, thanks to the attache's survival, we have a witness. Which name was I going to use? - Truland. - Dr Powell Alexis. {\an8}- Yes. - Department 6. The blast came from the au pair's room. Wonderful work. Pretty girl, this au pair? Young? Au pairs are usually young, but... Sure, sure. Tell me, was Mrs Fineberg present when you interviewed the attache? Naturally. He was still in shock. Why? I think I should speak to him alone, don't you? I think the guilt that is stopping his mouth now will force it open if it is just us Israelis. The au pair's beautiful friend, what were her distinguishing features? Anything unique? I never said she was beautiful. Didn't you? Well, what was she wearing then? A cardigan. A cardigan. - Hello. - And how... How far was it buttoned up? Honesty now. Hello. May I speak with Ucki, please? Your au pair. Ucki didn't tell you? She left on holiday, just two hours ago now. I thought she wasn't leaving till tomorrow. Her mother gave me this to bring her. Records. Ucki's crazy about Yankee pop. Blonde or brunette, dyed, or natural? Up, or down? - Would you like to... - My friend is waiting. Blonde, dyed, down. An attractive Western girl, again. And you took the suitcase up to the au pair's room. Yes. Into the au pair's room. Yes. Now, think hard. Was there anything else, anything about this woman that she herself might miss? A bracelet, rings, earrings? Driving, on foot? Driving. An NSU. The colour, salmon, or beach, Vienna sausage. Copper brown NSU, copper brown. She was in the passenger seat... ..Looking back at me... ..Over her shoulder. Back? What about the headrest? I'm certain I saw her face. What about the driver? He was Arabic. He looked worried, I think. Yes. This was everything that was retrieved? Ja, Herr Schulman. Nothing elegant, absolutely everything? Everything related to the bomb. Was there something like this? Thank you. A copper brown NSU was found abandoned in a car park outside of Munich this afternoon. The headrest? - Missing. - Right. Only the passenger's side. Get her description out. I want surveillance on every suspected safe house in Munich. Ok. Oh, lovely. It's rather big, isn't it? They tattooed adults and children the same size. Children grow. So does the tattoo. My God. Dr Alexis. May I call you Paul? Yes. I've learned it is best, as Israelis, to be selective, find a friend, help him along in his profession, guardedly, informally, and in return we expect our friends to help us. So... A few years ago, a bunch of Palestinians raised a certain amount of hell in my country. First they hit a supermarket in Beit She'an. Next, a few settlements. And when they began to attack schools, I could not take it any longer. They were four brothers, our intelligence said. Family. And the eldest of them... He had a genius to him. I'm sorry to compare him to a German, but he was Mozart. An Austrian. Mozart was. Oh, that's right. Khalil. Khalil. Khalil. The eldest. I put together a team, and within months of our investigation any normal Palestinian couldn't have lit a match near Israel without us hearing of it first. But then... Milan. And Zurich. - And now... - This. - Yes. You know the Arabic driver of the NSU? This was the youngest brother. Khalil's cells are discreet. Impenetrable. And his people never take the same route twice. But with your help, who knows what is possible. Because you see, Paul, sooner or later, a man will sign his name. Set free, child, {\an8}after such wickedness as yours. {\an8}What are you dreaming of? You promised me my life, but you lie! You think that life is nothing more than not being stone dead. And to keep from me everything that brings me back to the love of God, when it is your wickedness and foolishness that tempts me to hate him. Light your fires, for I know your counsel is of the devil and mine is with God. Blasphemy! Blasphemy! Witch! Witch! Burn the witch! Satan! Tell Marty we've got her. Charlie, someone left it for you. Did you see who? No, sorry, Dawn took it, I think she's buggered off. It's a bit light. We are already in motion, Noah. The enemy is using Westerners, so must we. Our fiction has to match their reality. Can't you find a Jewish insert? We can't count on gentile loyalty. If you want to catch a lion... ..A toy goat won't play her, Noah. Our goat has to be alive, has to smell right, has to taste right. Has to have a heart. Even if it is in the wrong place right now. I don't buy it. This is our chance, Noah. We get to Khalil through Salim. - His baby brother. - No. We take him out. This fiction, answers, infiltration? The government needs immediate action, Marty. Have your actions stopped Khalil before, hm? Let us be surgeons, this time, not butchers. We get inside Khalil's network, then we catch him. The budget for what I am proposing will cost less than the gas in your jets for a single raid. You are a dreamer, Marty. - Always were. - I am an artist. And with respect for your rank... ..You are a bourgeois arsehole. Oh, of course. I will need ten more team members for this. Ten! We got the five men. I should have asked the bastard for 20. The retired lady in London, Miss Bach, gift for creation. - The lush? - Yes, I want her in Munich tomorrow. And get me the old forger Schwilli, too. So the lush and the crazy, perfect. The perfect pair, just like you and me. When Miss Bach strays, he bores her back into sobriety. Charlie painted this herself. Mad, isn't it? Necessary sacrifices. Two Zionists killed in Germany and the Palestinian cause is all over the news. One of them was an eight-year-old Zionist. I'd love to know your politics at that age. Al, the eight-year-old Marxist. I thought you were against the Zionists. As it happens, I do feel like there's a way to achieve peace without killing people. Darlings! Hush, you brilliant people. I... I just spoke to our agent, Mary. We have an angel who's fallen in love with our troupe. What does that mean? Shush, quiet. He's sending us all to Greece. - What? - On some sort of corporate charity jaunt. For rehearsals?! As You Like It?! I bloody love it. A patron? What is this, the 1680s? Oh, just come with us. Come on, work another shift to cover the fare. God's sake, Charlie. Bombs going off in Germany, and you're celebrating because you get to sun yourself and neck Boutaris in Greece? Oh, if only you got work, right? Then you could come out there with us, and ruin our fun! Let's go from the top of the page. Your heart's desires be with you. Come, where is this young gallant, that so desires to live with his... Lie, lie. It's "Lie" With his mother. It's not live, it's lie. Come, where is this young gallant that so desires to - lie with his mother Earth. - Ready, Sir. But his will hath in it a more modest working... I'm going for a slash. - Hey. - Anyone want a drink? - Hm? - No, thanks, hun. No. Charlie. This was supposed to be our rehearsal jaunt. I know, I know. I'm an idiot. I'm sorry. Who owns that apartment? Some left-wing German banker. She's a character, this one, Marty. Feisty. You like her? A child killer? She is patient, Shimon. Which is admirable. Like Oded. I forgot to ask, Oded. How is your myopia? Did you see the specialist? I did, thank you. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Michel! My God. Little brother Salim has grown up. - Why are you still wearing that? - What? - Are you stupid? - No. They will recognise it. Take it off, take it off now. Too late. You've called the devil in. Come on, how hard would it be to put a rocket across that road right now and end it? We've done it before! Shimon, that boy is a blessing to us ALIVE. What about our boys, huh? Are they not a blessing, too? This way, I need to show you something. 72 Olympics. 11 Israeli athletes held hostage here and killed by Palestinians like Salim. He must have been a kid when it happened. He's still a kid. I remember it, though. Two killed here. Nine at the airport. I saw it on TV. You know what wasn't on TV? They castrated one of them. So, grow up... ..And hold on to your balls. We must be as patient, Shimon, as they are. We met on the ferry, right? On the way over here? - Yes. - You didn't tell me your name. - Rose. - Ah, where are you from? South Africa. Daddy brings his yacht here when he's on business. Athens was so boring. - I'll come down, yeah? - Yeah, yeah, come down. - Charlie. - Mm? - It's him. - What? He's back. Action Man. Why does he keep on hanging around us? Do you think he's following us? We've seen him at the market, the pier, the taverna. He hasn't looked at us once. I bet he knows we're watching him. - Oh, screw it, I'm going in. - What? Sophie. Sophie! You look like you might be thirsty. Erm...soif? Sete? No? Thank you. What happened? He's got...scars. - What? - Yeah, like someone's taken a red-hot piece of wire to him or something. - He could be a gangster. - Did you catch his name? We didn't quite get that far, I'm afraid. But I saw what he was reading. Debray's Conversations with Allende. Well, I love him. You should buy him a drink. - A fireman. - What fireman reads Debray?! - My kind of fireman! - An architect? A terrorist? You're an oil trader. You look like you should work in oil. Oh, you would look good covered in baby oil. A spy. No, he's an actor. Look at him. Me and you. Hollywood. How about it? Al got an audition. Not a bloody audition, a part. Just last night, the producers booked me a first-class ticket out tomorrow, so... He's Joseph. Can't you see? With his coat of many colours. Charlie... What's your name? - Peter. - Peter what? - Charlie! Charlie... - It's fine. - Peter what? - So you're Charlie? I thought that was a boy's name. Well, I'm a girl, Jose. - Charlie... No, honestly, you lot are like little kids, animal, vegetable, mineral. - Chas. - Can you not see his shtick? International man of mystery. Chas! Look at that face. Yeah, well, don't come crying to me when he cleans out your travellers cheques. We came here to work, guys. If you are going to leave me in here give me champagne and caviar, you angelic Zionist saviours! Did you say something in there? There are speakers, so if you want, you can listen to it in here. Oh, Miss Bach, you have outdone yourself. Better even than I expected. Couple more scratches on the walls, perhaps? As quick as you can. I need your steadiest hand on this. Trust me. Ah, our newest hunter. Welcome back, Daniel. Still kosher, I presume? Shimon, make sure he has everything he needs. He's a big boy, he can handle himself. Ah, thank you for calling me up, Marty. I was losing my mind in Tel Aviv. I've missed this cheerful bastard. Oh, he's a ray of sunshine. We've put bunks upstairs. The matting and sheets in the bedroom is for Miss Bach only. And please make sure you sleep. A night without rest... Is a day without perspective. Oh, he is devilish, isn't he? - Who invited HIM? - That would be me. What? Mind the fire! Hello, big man. So excited. Look at this. Lovely. - Are you going now? - Yes. Evening. - Evening. - Hello. Erm...soif? Sete? Please don't ignore me again. You two, come on. To the beach! - To the beach. - Get a towel or a blanket. Get some wood for the bonfire. We're going to have this whole beach to ourselves. Do you know this tune, then? You were humming it at the taverna. Guillaume de Machaut? - No. - No? A friend wrote it for us back in London. St Joan. # If you'll meet me at the Red Barn # # As sure as I have life # # I will take you to Ipswich town # # And there make you my wife # Oh, I'm getting light-headed. # This young lad went home to fetch his gun # # His pickaxe and his spade # # He went unto the Red Barn # # And there he dug her grave # # I promised I would marry her upon a certain day # # Instead of that I was resolved # # To take her life # # To take her life away # - Hello. - Michel is on the move already. Say it again, Oded? Just booked himself a plane ticket. We're off to the races. Where is he flying to? Istanbul. Perfect, closer than we hoped. {\an8}- OK, see you, Marty. - Thank you. - I can't believe it. - No, no, no. Think like him for a moment, Shimon. He collects the Semtex in Turkey, yes, then drives back into Europe and on his way to his next attack, but where will that be? There's only one passage open to the west by land. They have to move faster than we expected, so we grab him at the border crossing here on the Greek side, just like we planned. We are go, start cleaning, Miss Bach. Morning. I'm working. At your table, sir? Nai parakalo. Efharisto. Richthoven. - What? - My name. Peter Richthoven. You're from Germany. I'm a mongrel. Even mongrels have homes. - Not all of them. - Passport. Mongrels tend to object to people fixing their identities with pieces of paper. Surely you, as a progressive, would understand that. How do you know I'm a progressive? You make a good show of it. Oh, look, this is ridiculous. Boutaris? How do you know I like Boutaris? I don't. I like it. Do you always drink at nine in the morning? Not in moderation. Have you ever been to London, Jose? Red Dragon Theatre. Should I have? No. Rosalind, my favourite of all Shakespeare's leading ladies. Who says I'm playing a leading lady? Found something. After that dispute, I moved to London. God, yeah, I haven't, I haven't spoken to Mum since. I don't want to ask her for anything, so I've been doing bar shifts and sofas all the way. I wouldn't have thought you'd be such a good listener, all the way up there. Why aren't you married, Jose...? Peter? - Why should I be? - Well, I mean, at your age. Thank you. Why aren't YOU? I refuse to be a slave to patriarchy. My new answer from now on! There was a divorce a few years ago. Well, of course, on my side there's the small matter of my deeply dodgy taste in men, so... What is it? You keep on trying to say something. I thought you'd look good in a bolder colour. I'm leaving. Today. Oh, no. Where to? Athens. Tour a little. I don't suppose you fancy joining me, just for a couple of days? If your friends can spare you. Why? Well, because I'm dodgy. Charlie! Come here! Come on! Come over here! Yeah, OK. Come on. One strawberry ice cream, please. The younger brother, we believe he's recruited girls like this before. This one is Anna Witgen. Some flimsy Swedish outcast from Baader-Meinhof, actually. Thank you, Paul. Now, my turn. I believe this Anna Witgen may recently have met with the baby brother right here in Munich. Really? Are you going to walk all the way to California? Thessalonica. I'm kind of vaguely heading that way. As vaguely as you like. Open up the back, then. I can't carry this on my lap. Fancy! Show it to me again. Now, I will need a touch more help clearing something across your notoriously fastidious border. What something? Well, it's a certain medical patient... ..who will be in a state of emergency. I feel like a giant chick. A devilish mongrel and a giant chick. Oh, my God! Rose! Rose! What? You got all those scars from women, didn't you? Don't you care for it? My mate has a jacket just like that. Does he? If I ask where we're going, will that ruin the surprise? They're coming. To be honest, Jose, I, I'm not, I'm not a fan of the alfresco fumble. I'm a three-course meal for mozzies. Leaves me feeling a bit exposed, you know? Where is everyone? It's closed at night. You bribed the guards? How will I ever fall in love after this? They built it to Athena, Goddess of Wisdom. - She gave her name to the city. - You're kidding. - They called it Erechtheion. - Oh, come on. It's true. The Byzantines then changed it into a church. The Ottomans, a harem. The same thing happened... ..to the Parthenon. The temple was built in mid-5th century BC and was dedicated to Athena Parthenos, the virgin. The temple remained intact until fifth century AD, when it was then transformed into a church, but soon after a mosque. Then there were various wars up until 1803, when the Brits decided to solve it all by sending in Thomas Bruce, Lord Elgin, to steal whatever he could and enshrine it as an act of heroism by selling it on to the British Museum. Thanks for the history lesson, though, very enlightening. Where did you get all that? The same guidebook as you, obviously. Human sponge, me. Read it, hear it, it's in. Yeah? So what did I say to you the first time we met? Well... ..you thought that Charlie was a boy's name. It then took you 19 hours to tell me your name, which is Peter Richthoven, you're a mongrel, you hate passports, you drink Boutaris at all hours of the day. You act like you've been everywhere in the world except London. You think I'm Rosalind. You were married once before, but you don't like talking about her. In fact, you don't seem to talk too much altogether, and when you do, you let on very little, which YOU think is incredibly mysterious and alluring and actually it's just really annoying, and we both agree that you're a bit dodgy. Shall I carry on, or will that do? Don't. Please. So, where are we going now? Taj Mahal? Actually, what is this? This? Yeah, this. All fur coat and great bloody chastity belt. OK, you need to slow down. I thought you liked fast cars. I never told you that. For God's sake, stop. Why are you going so fucking fast? Shit. OK, I've changed my mind about all of this, so can you stop and I'll get out and walk? It's not far now. What? What? What's not far? No, I want to go home. Can you just stop, please? I'll just get out. Please. What's going on? Some sort of white slave trafficking? Please tell me some good news, please. The good news is I have lied to you as little as possible. Oh, God. Rose? It's me, it's me, OK? I'm not going to hurt you, all right, girl? - What's going on? - It's OK, it's all right. Welcome, Charlie. I am the producer, writer and director of our little show and I would like to talk to you about your part.
