 I'm having a baby. What do you mean, you're having a baby? Is this... is this some kind of school assignment? No. I'm... pregnant? Amy, you can't be pregnant. That's impossible. Yeah... that's what I thought. But I am. Doctor told me. What doctor? Dr. Hightower. Dr. Hightower told you you're having a baby? Yeah. When? When did she tell you that? Um, I don't know. Maybe, like, six weeks ago or something. You went to see her six weeks ago, and she told you you're having a baby? I-I don't understand. Did you go and see her on your own? Because you thought you were... Y-You can't be pregnant. How could this possibly have happened? I didn't mean for it to happen. It just kinda happened. Is this something you and your sister have come up with? Is this some kind of conspiracy to get my mind off of your father? You want me to think you're pregnant so whatever's really happening isn't so bad. Is that it? Mom, I'm really pregnant. No, seriously. Amy, tell me the truth. OK, look at me and tell me the truth. I am telling you the truth. You can't be having a baby at 15 years old. What's going on? Ashley? Ashley! Did you know anything about this? Uh... I'm not sure. Yes, she knows. -She knows? -She just kind of found out. Mom, I didn't mean for it to happen. I really didn't. You didn't mean for what to happen? You didn't mean to have sex? You didn't mean to get pregnant? You know, it could've been an alien abduction. I hear there's a lot of that happening. I think I want an abortion. OK, you can run now. Go. I didn't do anything. Just go to your room, Ashley! All right. She's the one that's having a baby. An abortion? I don't wanna have a baby. Uh... I don't know, Amy. I just... I don't know. L-Let's just think about this, OK? Let's think about all of the options. Mom, if you don't let me get an abortion, I wanna leave. Go somewhere. Aren't there, like, homes for teenage mothers? Find me a home. But, honey, this is your home. I can't stay here and have a baby. www.1000fr.com presents Sync:VinE greenBB S01E06 She's not gonna be in today and, um, probably not for the rest of this week. We have to go to Chicago. Someone died. Yeah, it was a family member. What difference does it make? Anyway, I'm sure she can catch up with her assignments when we get back. Thank you. Bye. I'm gonna call my ob/gyn as soon as the office opens. Why can't I go to Dr. Hightower? Amy, she's a pediatrician, and I'm really not happy she didn't call me about this. And because her partner is your father's ex-wife's husband, so that means he probably knows, and if he knows, then she knows, and I'm really not happy that they knew before I did. Wait. Mom,  you don't think he'd tell Grace about this, do you? Yeah, Amy, probably. I left word for your dad at his office. Why? I don't know who he's with, so I didn't wanna call his cell. No, no, no. I meant... do you have to tell him? I don't want to, but I think we should before someone else does.Don't you? Do we have to? Yes. Well, what if I just don't have the baby? Not have the baby? Amy, you can think about... that. That's totally your choice, but... I don't think I can tell you to do that, and it's not a religious thing with me at all. It's just how I feel about... ...I don't know, life. Have you told Ben? Oh, Amy... what happened to having a plan? You're supposed to have a plan for sex. You're supposed to have a plan that says you'll wait until you're older so you can get an education and have a career before you settle down and start a family. I never thought about it. I didn't know any guy would ever wanna do it with me. Maybe we can think about adoption. Or you can go away until the baby comes. What if you go to my mom's? Do you wanna go to Mimsy's? No, I don't want Mimsy to know about this. -Amy... -What? You didn't tell Mimsy Dad left. She doesn't need to know about that. She doesn't need to know about this. Can I just ask you something? What? If I did end up having the baby, do you think I could get married? Married? Yeah. Ben said he would marry me. Is that how this happened? Ben said he would marry you if you got pregnant? So am I going to school, or what? No, not today.  You should've told me about this. That's my punishment for not telling you, not going to school? Fine. If you knew your sister was in trouble, you should've told me. Yeah.  I guess I also should've told you your marriage was in trouble. Ashley, wait. Look, I know you blame me for your dad leaving, but maybe it's not my fault. Or maybe it is. I'm gonna sit on the steps and wait for him. Your dad hasn't called me back yet. He will. Just please wait inside. Please. Can't, Mom.  I don't wanna be inside. I hate this house. I hate everything about it. Including me? Mom, just please, please do not send Amy off to Mimsy's. It's bad enough Dad left. If she leaves, there's no one here for me, no one I like, anyway. Oh, thanks. You know, your sister's the one that wants to go away. -Where else am I gonna send her? - Nowhere. Just don't let her go, Mom, please. Ashley, I don't know if Amy can stay here and be pregnant and have a baby. I don't know how she can handle everyone else knowing. But they do know. The whole world knows. -Hello? -Hi, Ames. Hi, Dad. Your mom called me, about you. What's going on? She said you're sick or something? Uh, not exactly. Uh-oh. Woman problems? Huh... sort of. So... you don't need to come home or anything. I'll be OK. Yeah? You sure? Yeah, positive. So how are you? Me? Oh, I'm all right. Miss my girls. Amy? Dad. Aw, Ames. Aw, baby, don't cry, sweetheart. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make you cry. I'll get home as soon as I can, as soon as your mom lets me. Dad, I think I need to tell you something and please don't be mad at me. How could I ever be mad at you? Wait a minute.  Did you break up with the Sausage King's kid? Is that what this is about? No. So that's still going good, huh? Yeah, I guess. So what's the matter with my girl? She's pregnant, George. Amy's pregnant. I don't think you should make any more phone calls right now. You just need time to think. Just... gimme a little time. I'll give it back to you eventually. -Call her. -I texted her. And? Nothing. I have a bad feeling about this. Me too. Maybe we could go over there during lunch. Just show up at her house? We could tell her mom we were  bringing her her assignments. I can't. We could make it legit, actually take her her assiments. I know her class schedule. I-I really can't. My parents won't let me. Since when? Since I told them. I can't believe you told them. What if she's not even home? Maybe... maybe she went to... you know, take care of things. Take care of things? Shut up, Lauren. She's not going to do that. Madison, it's her decision, not yours and not mine. Amy has a right to decide what she wants to do. If she wants to terminate the pregnancy, it's none of our business. We can have an opinion, but it's her choice. Hello, ladies. Is your friend Amy around? She missed band practice. Is she sick or somethin'? Do you speak? I think she stayed home today. You think or you know? I think if Amy wanted you to know where she was, she'd call you. Maybe I'll ask your brother. Maybe he would know. How do you know I have a brother? 'Cause he's got a big mouth he should keep shut right now. We all should keep our mouths shut now, don't you think? I tried calling you last night, all night. Yeah, I know that. I had to turn my phone off. I had to report in to that guy I was telling you about, the guy who's like a parole officer. He has to make sure I'm not getting beaten or anything. After that, I had to meet with him and my foster parents so they could confirm they're not beatin' me. That was my night. Yeah, OK, whatever. Have you heard the rumors going around school? I'm not really into gossip. I did wanna talk to Amy Juergens about something. Have you seen her? Weren't you gonna give her a ride home yesterday? I offered her a ride. Why is that? I wanted to talk to her. About? A couple of things, including you. I don't think it would be too smart if Amy had your baby.Do you? What baby? You know what baby. So did you talk to her? No, I couldn't find her, so I'm talkin' to you. Look, leave her alone and let things take their natural course, OK? Meaning? Meaning Amy Juergens is not having a baby at 15, so don't interfere. It's not like you could. I'm sure she's already taken care of it,  which is probably  why she's not here. Why would I wanna interfere with something like that? Oh, I don't know Maybe because you want to convince the whole world you're a Christian now. So let me see, you're jealous of both Amy and Grace? I'm not jealous of anyone. We're just friends, remember? Yeah, I remember. Grace heard about Amy. Does seem to be all over school this morning. Please tell me you don't want her so badly that you'd pretend to care about  that baby just to impress her. You have a very low  opinion of me.Don't you? Yeah, I do. Hi, Ricky. How are you? Tough day? Yeah, it is a tough day, but it's not true, you know, about Amy Juergens. I told you what happened before, but just believe me, even though it was her idea, I'll?? She's not?? Ricky... She's a sweet girl. She's just a little mixed up. I'm sure she's not having my baby. I'm positive. I don't know. Where did you hear that? Can't say. -Adrian? -Can't. Ricky, did you read that  bible passage I told you about? Oh, no, the bible passage. We don't have any of those bible books in the house. I'll get you one. No, don't spend your money on me, babe. I've got an extra one. I'll bring it for you. All right, well, thank you. I appreciate that. Look, Ricky, I'm trying to be a friend to you. You're gonna need a friend, I think... because Amy Juergens really is having a baby. -I have it on good authority. -But... Well, I mean, maybe she was, but according to someone else, she's taken care of it. What do you mean, taken care of it? Wait, you mean she's having an abortion? I think that's a possibility. Oh, no. Come on. I will not let anything bad happen to your baby. Her phone's not in service. It was in service an hour ago. How can it not be in service? Ashley. Call Ashley. Yeah, Ashley. I'll call... What? Hey, Ashley. It's me - Madison. No kidding. That must be why your  name showed up on my phone. Yeah, right. Um, I was having a little trouble getting ahold of Amy? Mom took her cell. Well, could we maybe talk to her on your phone? Best I can do is try to give her a message. What's the message? I know. How about you're both very sorry you told everyone in the world that your best friend Amy's pregnant? She knows we told people. Look, I have to go over there. If you don't wanna go, it's your own business. How are you gonna get there? There's a really big thing with a lot of wheels called a bus. Losers called. Madison and Lauren? You still have your cell. Mom didn't take it from you? Yeah. She's in the show- -Give it to me. -OK. Um, can I have the number for Adrian Lee? No, it's either residential or a cell phone. Just please give me the number. Adrian, hey. Wait up. I need a ride. Can you gimme a ride? No. I'll pay you. I need to get to Amy's house, Amy Juergens. Pay me? How's $100? 200? She wants me to take her to a clinic. She called me. Yeah, I know. She called me, too. She's gonna need money. It's a free clinic. Just the same, she wants me to be there. $200. 250, and we'll call it a day. Come on. She's a new patient, but I'm not a new patient. I've been coming there for years. Really?  I was hoping he could work her in this afternoon. It's an emergency. No, not an emergency-room emergency.  An I-need-to-see- Dr. Ahn emergency. She's on the phone. She can't get you in to see her doctor or at least it doesn't sound like it. Shut the door. I'm... I'm not going to her doctor. Yeah, OK, but where are you going? I can't tell you because  then you'd have information that a lot of others are gonna want, but... let's just say I'm taking control. I won't tell anyone. I think you can trust me at this point. Ashley, I know I can trust you, I know. It's just... it's better for you not to know. What happened to Dad? Where is he? What's going on? We were just looking for Dad. He's probably at the high school looking for Ben Boykewich. Ben? Yeah, that would be my guess. OK, you guys, if there's anything else I don't know, I think now's the time to tell me. Married? - They're in love. - They're 15. I fell in love with my wife when I was 14. You didn't get married when you were 14. I wish we had. Our parents made us wait till we were 18. All those years, wasted. You actually think they should get married and have a baby at 15.??? It's a little unconventional, but, hey, they're good kids. ???If they were good kids,we wouldn't be sitting here having this conversation. We're not talking abt them drinking or doing drugs, we're talking about two kids in love, that's all. That's n??? It's not the ideal situation, but it could be worse. She's my baby. Well, he's my baby. It's not what either of us would've planned for our children. I'm just saying Ben and I would be very pleased to share our good fortune with Amy, if you'd be kind enough to allow her to make an honest young man outta him. Ben and me, we're in that big house all alone. We'll take very good care of your Amy. I promise you that. Suppose this little teage marriage doesn't work out. Suppose it does. You can't be serious. Two 15-year-olds getting married and having a baby. I don't want my daughter married at 15. Why would you want your son married at 15? Misses his mother. You can't give him my daughter. He loves her. So do I. Your wife is calling. She says it's an emergency. Emergency! Yeah, hi. I turned my cell phone off. I'm here talking to Leo Boykewich. I think it does concern him. What are you talking about? Who? It's not... it's not even your son's baby. Could be. Go. She's talking to Dad. - I love you, Ashley. - Just go. Amy, Leo Boykewich went - W-Where's Amy? - She's in the bathroom. - Oh. So, who went to see Dad? Ben's father. Really? That was nice. So, are you gonna let them get married? Ashley, she's 15 years old. Besides, it's not Ben's responsibility. Well, would you rather she marry Ricky? He's 16. No, I don't want her to marry either one of them. I don't want her to get married, period. I think it's gonna complicate her life even more. Are you sure she's in the bathroom? - She was. - Amy! I'm here, Mom. Hi. Hurry up. So are we going or not? Ben, I really don't think you should be here. I thought you told him to come  with us. That's what he said. I can't let you do this. My dad is talking to your dad. He's trying to talk him into letting us get married. Married? Yes, married. I love her. I wanna marry her, and I also want some privacy. Ben, I told my mother it's Ricky's baby. What'd you do that for? Can you stay out of this, please? What'd you do that for? It's the truth. She said she'd help me if I told her the truth. Ben, it's really nice of you to wanna marry me, but this is not your problem. This is my problem. Yeah, well, now it's also Ricky's problem. He's not going to marry you. You know that, right? Ricky will never marry you. Yes, Adrian, I know that. But I will. I'll marry you. I love you. I don't care about anything else but you and that baby. And maybe the cymbals. I don't want to have a baby, Ben. Of course you don't. But you're going to have a baby, and that's OK with me. No, I can't. I just, I can't. Yes, you can. It's gonna be OK. You thought the worst part was telling your parents, but now that you've told them, everything gets better from here. They love you. Yeah, I guess. My mom is talking about sending me off to some home where there are other girls in the same situation? Ben, she's talking about adoption. Then that settles it. Don't have the baby. You don't want some  weird couple raising a baby that's gonna track you down when your life is finally getting better. Adrian, I'd be more than happy to double your car fare if you'll just shut up, OK? Some things are more important than money, even to me. He's not gonna marry you, either. You know that, right? Ricky is never going to marry you. OK, can you guys just  drive me to the clinic? You two can argue while you wait for me. I just feel that if your decision is not to have the baby, you really should talk to your parents or at least to your mother. This is a big decision to make all by yourself. But it is her decision. She's right. This is up to me. I've decided. Drive. No wonder she's in trouble. You can't keep an eye on her in the middle of this. Shut up, George. It's not my fault. - Sure that is. You're her mother. - And you're her father. You're the one who was supposed to talk to her about sex. She was never interested in talking about it. She was more focused on her friends and her music. And having sex. - It was just one time. - That's what they all say. All say? Who says that? Every girl who's afraid to tell her parents she's having a baby. I believe her. You believed me when I said I was said it was workin' late. You're criticizing me for trusting you?  No. I'm criticizing you for trusting her. I think it's ridiculous we're not out there looking for her. Where are we gonna look? I know she'll come home. What, after she has an abortion? She wanted to be with Ben. She's with Ben.  Good. I'm not so sure she shouldn't marry Ben. Don't be ridiculous. Being ridiculous. It might make sense. - Hi, Mr. Juergens. - Hi, Madison. Is Amy home? I brought her things from school. I brought her notes, her assignments from class. You know, notes. They're really good notes. OK. I'll give 'em to her. Could I give 'em to her? Um, is she home? Uh, yeah, but she's a little under the weather, and it's something that might be contagious, so you shouldn't stick around. Oh, OK. Hi, Mrs. Juergens. - If you could tell her I was trying to call her. - OK. But... Bye, Amy! OK, bye. Bye. Maybe if you didn't let her heng out with those two, none of this would've happened.  Madison and Lauren? They're very nice girls, and so is Amy. Yeah, just not as nice as we thought. And who's this Richie character, anyway? Ricky. He's in the band. You've seen him. He's that drummer that's always showing off. Hey... - Maybe it's time I come home. - No, I don't think so. Come on, you need me. We need each other. You said it yourself, you don't do well in a crisis. Lean on me, all right? We'll get through this together. We'll figure it out. You can't handle something like this. You can't handle little Amy going through something like this, not without me. How's Amy gonna face people? How are you gonna face people? I don't know, George. How do you face people? I'm not gonna cause you any problems... No, you're certainly not. Is there a girl named Amy Juergens here? Who's here a who's not ot none of your business. But if you need help with family planning, I'd be happy to set you up with one of our counselors. Jesus is my counselor. What a coincidence. He's mine, too. I don't think so. - What are you doing here? - What are you doing here? - Where's Amy? - Amy? Who's Amy? Ben and I are here to... get free condoms. Let's just step outside. I know she's here. This isn't a teen center. We're not gonna have any ruckus here. You and your friends need to step outside. Security. All right, let's go. Let's go. I'm not gonna let you do this, Amy! - Now all of you. - Amy! - Outside, Miss. - I'm not doing anything. Just a minute. You two drove her  here. You're accessories to a crime. Didn't I tell you to stay out of this? Are you that desperate to sleep with her? You really think she'd be any fun at all? Is that all you ever think about sex? Tell her the truth,you cower. You don't care about Amy or that baby. You don't care if Amy has an abortion. Yes, he does and so do I. And so does God. Oh, honey, they do not take a vote on these things. Don't call me honey. Why not? Honey. - I'm not with these guys, I swear. - Yo, Ben. Someone wants to talk to you. All right, let's move it outside. Come on. Amy, are you OK? Hey. Ben, I'm so sorry I yelled at you. Oh, it's OK. You can yell at me my whole life. He took advantage of her just like he's trying to take advantage of you. She seduced him. Oh, come on. Is that what he told you? All right, you two. I'm standing right here. Forget about me. There's a very hurt and confused girl in there. And who hurt and confused her? Why do you have to blame everything on Ricky? Amy is just as responsible for what happened. She wanted to have sex. Oh, and that is so wrong, isn't it, Grace? Outside of marriage, yeah, it is wrong. It's normal. It's normal to want to have sex. It's even normal to actually do it. - It's a sin. - Oh, yeah. And all us normal teenagers are going straight to hell. Is that what you think? You know what? Jack really liked it. You know that? And he would never be happy with you after being with me. I wouldn't wanna be with Jack after he's been with you. You want to be with Ricky, and he's been with me, too. That's probably one of the reasons why Ricky wants to be born again. Oh, is that right, Ricky? Again, I should not be the focus of concern here. Maybe we should all pray together, for Amy. Thank you for everything, Ben. I really just need my mom, though. Can I borrow your phone so I can talk to my mom? Sure. He's slime. He's total slime. You know he's got a girlfriend? I mean, I guess you could call her that, but she's a real slut. Don't say slut. I don't like that. But, Dad, she is. She does it with all the guys, not just Ricky. How do you know that? You're a 12-year-old in middle school. I'm 13. I'm not a child. Amy's the only one that treats me like an adult. How did Amy get mixed up with this guy? He's in the band. They went to band camp. I knew that French horn would come to no good. That's too big an instrument for a girl. You think this was all caused by a French horn? Don't get smart. I'm trying to have a conversation here. So is your mom seeing someone? What, like a shrink? No, not like a shrink. Like a guy. Is she dating? I'm just asking, that's all. No, I don't think she's seeing anyone. So who's this slut? What? The drummer's girlfriend. Adrian. She's a majorette. Adrian? Lee. You know what? I probably shouldn't be here when your mother gets home with Amy. I'm gonna give them some time together. Three of you girls... should have some time together. Come on, could I get a little sympathy here? This girl I don't even know and care nothing about is gonna ruin my life. Your life? What about her life? Her life is her business, and if she wanted to ruin her life, she should've chosen someone else to do it with. You think Amy wanted this to happen? Adrian, of course she wanted it to happen. She wants out of her life, and she doesn't care how she gets out of her life as long as she gets out. She's... unloved. She wants to be loved, by me, by the baby, that stupid Ben guy. Anyone. Everyone. She's got problems. I just got caught in her problems. Like I don't have enough problems of my own. Are you gonna marry her? Marry her? Is that what you're worried about? Is that why you drove her to that clinic? That's why you wanted her to get an abortion. Don't be so dramatic. I drove there 'cause she asked me to drive her there. You told me she'd already taken care of this. I said I thought she had. I knew you'd go running around with Grace Bowman on a Save the Baby campaign. Like you care about an unborn child. Jeez, you don't care about anything but yourself. You're such a liar, you know that? Grace thinks I'm a nice guy, and you know what, and around her, I am a nice guy. And you know what who are you lying to now, me or you? Nice guy? Huh. No. You're not a nice guy, and I'm not a nice girl. That's why you belong with me, not Grace and certainly not Amy, even if she is having your baby. Think I don't know that? Hey. Why do you care if Ricky's gonna have a baby, anyway? - You're just friends, right? - What do you want, Jack? You. I want you. I miss you. Good. I hope you miss me for the rest of your life. Come on, Gracie. Reverend Stone said he'd talk to your father about us. If you just give us another chance... Don't take it personally. I don't like cheaters. I don't. It's not about me, it's about Adrian. Grace, I regret what I did, and I apologize. I take full responsibility for my actions, and that's more than Ricky's ever gonna do for Amy Juergens. You don't know that. You're right, I don't. Maybe being friends with you has made him a better person. You mean that? If anyone can change someone for the better, it's you. You think that? I know I'm a better person 'cause of you. Let me know if you change your mind, OK? You have to say somethin It's your job. This is a little outside my area of expertise. However... Yes, however... You do know that a marriage between 15-year-olds probably doesn't have a chance in hell of surviving, especially when you add in the complication of raising a child. That's a textbook response. I'm looking for something human. I mean...This is me and my beloved Amy we're talking about. I know that, Ben. But even if you and Amy were 30 years old, it'd still be a difficult situation. So what you're saying is the odds are better at 30? I'll marry her again when I'm 30. I can't imagine her parents would let her get married now. As in get married to me? You don't think they'll let her get married to me, or to that... fertile predator? To anyone, Ben. Why? They might consider it to be making a second mistake. It's no mistake. I love her. Yeah, well, sometimes that's just not enough. Huh. What are you talking about? Yes, it is. It's enough. It's... everything. Oh. Oh, I get it. Get what? You know, I always knew it. I sensed it. Who broke your heart, counselor? No one broke my heart. I told you before, I can't discuss personal matters with students. Can you get a pizza with a student and his father? Leo Boykewich. Marc Molina. - I figured I'd find you here. - How'd it go with Amy's dad? - You went to see Amy's dad? - Yeah. Ehh, he'll come around. How'd it go with Amy? Ehh, she'll come around. Ehh... and if they don't come around? If the man doesn't want his 15-year-old daughter to marry a 15-year-old boy who's not the father of her baby? And if she doesn't wanna get married at 15 just because she's having a baby? Who broke his heart? I don't know. He can't discuss personal matters with me. Come on, we'll get some pizza. He'll shut his ears. 15-year-olds getting married. I'm doing my job. I'm sorry. I know you're sorry, Amy. And I'm sorry that this happened to you, but it did. You can stop apologizing, OK? Things are what they are, and we're just gonna have to figure them out. Please just let me marry Ben. Amy, it's not that you're too young. We're young, but, Mom, he loves me. And I love him. I know, and I believe it. I do. But you're in a difficult situation,and I don't think you should let Ben rescue you. OK, If you're still in love in a few years, that's wonderful. Get married when you're out of college or when you've worked a few years. But right now, let's see if you can take responsibility and handle this on your own. OK, I'll help you through this. But if he's willing to help... There are consequences to being rescued, believe me. What consequences? It's too soon to know yet, but there are consequences. I don't get why you think that. I just don't think it, I know it. I've lived it. Your father rescued me, and I've been trying to repay him ever since. How did Dad rescue you? Amy... I was pregnant. I have a brother or sister somewhere? No. Wait. Me? You got married to Dad 'cause you were pregnant with me? We eloped six months before you were born. We tell everyone else it was 18 months, but... we lied. So we've actually only been married for 15 years, not 16. So... when you found out you were pregnant, you told your mother you were already married? Yeah. Do you think you made the right decision to marry Dad? I would hate it if you made a mistake because of me. No, I think I made the right decision. I'm happy I married your father. I'm happy that we had you. I'm even happy we have Ashley. Do you think I made the right decision? Yeah, I think you made the right decision for you. Mom, why wouldn't you tell me about this? It was my little secret. Mine and your father's. Some things are really hard to talk about. Yeah. So, I guess we both can work on that, huh? Yeah. I love you, Amy. I love you, too. So what are you most afraid of? That it'll hurt. Oh, it will. Don't worry. I'll be rigth there with you. What else? I don't want Ashley to have problems because of me. I don't want anyone to say anything to her. I just don't want her to think that this is romantic at all just because of Ben. welcome to www.1000fr.com  www.tvsubtitles.net
