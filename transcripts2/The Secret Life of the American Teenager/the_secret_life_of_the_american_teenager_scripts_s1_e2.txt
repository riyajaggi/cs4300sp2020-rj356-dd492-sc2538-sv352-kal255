 You know, if you had your own car, I wouldn't have to take you to work. I don't have a car because you ran it over with a tractor. Not that I was attached to that car. I was not attached to that car. But it doesn't matter anyway. I'll take the bus. I like the bus. Yeah, but somebody has to take you to the bus. I'll take him. But you gotta ride on back. I'll just go put some clothes on. Why don't you have any furniture? You're not attached to her either? But you were a little girl once. There's no proof of that.

 Didn't dream of the big wedding? Dad walking you down the aisle? Didn't dream about who your bridesmaids would be? Didn't dream about the dress either. Anna turner, married last night in the hotel. Housekeeping found her like that. Someone took the time to cover her up after. Cared for her appearance. The killer was probably someone she knew. Okay, there'll be a lot of out-of-town guests checked in, family and friends. No one goes home until we say so. Cash wedding gifts. At least, uh... 50 grand in here. Robbery gone wrong? Let's get this photographed and inventoried. Please, detective, I was hoping we could just split it up. And the groom is where? Hasn't turned up yet. But would you stick around if you did that? Well, doesn't look like he went far. Why, because he left his shoes here? No. Because he left his wallet, watch, and keys here. "Jake silvers. " did you kill your bride, jake? Okay, listen up. We're looking for the groom, jake silvers. Floor by floor, you all know the drill. Let's go. How'd you know there was something in that shoe? Could see one shoe was heavier than the other because it sat lower on the carpet. Oh, you expect me to believe that? I have no expectations as to what you will or will not believe. And whatever you do believe can't change whatever's in that shoe. Why exactly can't you talk like a normal person? When exactly was the last time you actually met a normal person? Anna. She saved me. jake? Hey, maybe you should slow down a little with the tequila. I got married last night. Did you know that? Yeah, we heard about that. Is that anna's blood? You're cops. How about you stand up for us right now, jake? Okay? I'm not a good person. Why'd you say that? She thought I was. I just wanted to be the person that anna thought I was. You're gonna put those on me now. Just for a little while. This is anna's blood. I have to go see anna. We'll take you to her. No - no, you won't! don't shoot! Don't you shoot. well, get him outta there. crews. Crews, come on. Crews, come on. Come on, crews. Let's go. detective carl ames lead detective crews murder case You were the lead detective on the charlie crews murder case? Yeah, I worked that case. Took my 20 right after we closed it. And no dna's gonna tell me we got the wrong guy. Here's what's left of tom seybolt. Boyhood friend and part owner in a bar with crews. But tom was skimming so crews goes to settle the books and kills tom. Here's tom's pretty wife. Dead couple had two kids. Used to call crews "uncle charlie. " you lost these. Stun baton? 900, 000 volts. Felt like more. Where's jake? I hope you die, you son of a bitch! They should've shot you for what you did to my anna! - Parents of the bride? - Yeah. don't you just love weddings? We have hair and blood here. Blunt force trauma back here. Somebody pushed her hard up against the wall. Somebody strong. Yeah, or someone very angry. I just needed to get this bag in- please, I- hey, that's okay, officer. I got this. Thanks. Hey, I'm sorry about that. I'm detective crews. You're? Tiffany... Tiffie. I was one of anna's bridesmaids. You look a lot younger than anna. Can I ask how you knew her? Jake and my brother are friends. But anna was always so nice to me. She treated me... So nice. Um, the disposable cameras. Anna said it was my job to collect them. I thought maybe someone would want them. Of course. But you didn't have to bring them up here. Someone would've come for them. I wanted... What is it, tiffie? She said she had a brother. Maybe you can call him. You okay? She's not used to drinking like this. I told her have a beer. Steady her out, you know? But she wodn't listen to me. Anna's dead. I loved her. I know. I know. come on. I got your blood alcohol level test here, jake. I don't think I've ever seen a number this high. What name will they put on her tombstone? Did she take your last name? Yeah. She couldn't wait to be anna silvers. Is that what they'll put on her tombstone? Anna silvers? I'm sure they will. If she took your name, that was her name too. What happened after you got back to the suite? I passed out. And when you woke up- go ahead, jake. What happened when you woke up? Anna was on the floor. There was... Blood everywhere. Her dress was in the corner. She was dead. So you covered her up? Yeah. That's right. Because you didn't want her laying there like that. Why would someone kill her? You need to know who killed her. No matter who it is. Is it possible that you did something and you don't remember it? - No. - No? you had a lot to drink, jake. I saw you assault my partner. - You get violent. - I didn't- - you get violent when you get drunk. - No, I didn't! You've had a problem with violence in the past, haven't you, jake? But that was before. It was before anna. She saved me. If you loved anna, you need to know who did it, jake, no matter who that person is. For her! I couldn't. I couldn't. Could I? I mean... Could I have? Detectives, I am jake's attorney. Jake, I need you to stop talking. He doesn't have to talk. We have anna's blood all over him. We have his assault of a police officer. That would be me. I saw you at the hotel, didn't I? Yeah, that's right. I was at the wedding, the wedding party. But in this room, I am jake's attorney. Well, counselor... We have his admission of blacking out during the time of anna's death. He doesn't have to talk unless he's interested in avoiding the needle. Both the tractor and the bentley are registered to a charlie crews. Yes, yes, yes - that is correct. But you were driving the tractor? Yes, but both vehicles are insured by your company, so I need you- I have to get a supervisor. No, no - I don't need a supervisor. I need you to?? hi. Hello. Can I, uh, help you? Yes, I'm looking for charlie crews. Oh, well he's not here right now, so... Oh, what a shame. You must be that mr. Earley charlie met in prison. Is it true you live in his garage? Well, in a room above his garage actually, yeah. You look younger in person. I've seen you in the papers. Those pictures they use aren't very flattering. No, no... They're... they're not. They make you look grumpy. You don't seem grumpy. Who'd you say you were again? I didn't, I'm sorry. I'm olivia. And are you a friend of charlie's? Not exactly. But I hope to be. I hope to be your friend too, ted. Husband's got her blood on his hands. He can't account for where he was during the murder. He's got those assault charges in his jacket. Let's get what we need to make it stick. That's an interesting fruit. Thank you. It's a horned melon. Also known as a jelly melon, a kiwano, or the african horned cumber. African horned cucumber? Yeah, it's an ornamental fruit, but you can still eat it if you want to. I thought there'd be more. More to what? In the pool... with jake. You know when you put those volts in the water? I was almost dead. Yeah, I remember that. It was a near-death experience. And it not being a full-death experience should make you happy. Nothing happened. There were no lights. no tunnel. No dead relatives. Maybe I wasn't near death enough for it to be a near-death experience. Detectives, where are we with the anna turner killing? - Jake silvers- - jake didn't do it. There's no way he killed his wife. Um, that's very funny you say jake didn't do it, because your partner here says the opposite. And when I say "that's funny, " detective, of course I mean that's not funny. I know, but look - over the last 12 years, I've known more than a few men who've killed their wives. And I looked into jakes' eyes, and I just didn't see it there. You looked into his eyes? They are the windows to the soul. That's very profound, but the lapd believes jake silvers is a lead suspect, and because we believe this, the city of los angeles requires you to get him for anna turner's murder. Anna silvers. What? She was married. She took his name. She died anna silvers. Hey- I'm sorry. I sure do not envy you. Yeah, why is that? Woman boss, woman partner?? makes my head spin st thinking about what a hen house this department has become. Not like it used to be, huh? Hey charlie, you remember my wife? Leslie? sure I do. She's all over me to ask you to come out the house this weekend. Having a little backyard barbeque, family, friends- say yes, charlie. Don't make me go back to leslie with a no. I need to know if this is gonna be a thing with you. Which "this" is that? This thing with jake silvers. Are you gonna go see falsely accused people everywhere? You think that's not a good instinct for a cop to have? I just need to know if it's gonna be a thing with you. Shouldn't innocent until proven guilty be athingwith all of us? Were jake and anna having problems? Jake loved anna. Loved her! Would never hurt her. ever. Loved her. When jake met anna, the guy was totally lost. You mean his prior assault charges. Yeah. You're pretty. Shut up, mason! she's a cop. A pretty, pretty cop. And you, that dude - dude, you are so torn from the headlines! Thanks, dude. So you used to date anna. - A few times. - once. You know, just hook ups. nothing serious. Not like jake. And what about eddie? Did eddie ever "hook up" with anna? That would be a no. I don't think eddie plays for our team. Our team? I don't think eddie plays for any team. Eddie loves the law. There he is. Yo, eddie! What are you - what are you doing? Ease up, eddie. Why don't you grab yourself something? Take the edge off. You're drunk. Anna is dead, and jake is in jail for it. And the only thing you two can do is just sit there and drink. It's a... Wake? Anna loved jake. You can't believe how. Why don'you tell me how? Anna had a tough time growing up. Anna used to... Act out. I mean, we all did stuff, but anna always had to go further - drink more. Was she involved with drugs? It's okay. You can tell us. We're investigating the murder. Was she involved with drugs? She always had to do more drugs. More guys, more everything. It was more than partying, what she used to do. Like, I don't know. Punishment. Yeah... Punishment... Until she met jake. They were a team. And you used to date jake. - On and off. - at parties sometimes. Just hook ups? Can I ask you something? About anna? No, about jake. If he doesn't remember what he did?? what he did to anna, is it as bad as if he did rember it? You mean legally? Tiffany, if jake killed anna, he's going to prison for a very long time if he remembers it or not. How's your partner doing? I'm not a rat, lieutenant. I'm not asking you to be one, detective. It'd be better for your partner if he was removed from duty. The lapd is not... The best environment for him to be in. The best environment? You can do this, dani. You can do something good for crews, for the department, and good for yourself. So if it's bad for the department, is it bad for me too, lieutenant? Where are you right now? Dani, this is not an excuse to backslide. Do you understand me? I'm actually going in to a meeting right now. buy me a drink. Do I know you? Does it matter? detective carl ames lead detective crews murder case Mr. Andrews, my realtor called about me stopping by to look at the house. There was no forced entry. They just let crews walk right in. You mean the killer? It wasn't crews. Crews was exonerated. Sure, if you like. "The killer. " you have a beautiful home. Thank you. Husband's body was found in the living room. Throat was slit. Would you like some tea, mr. Burke? No, no thank you. Never thought about selling, but then your realtor called and said someone wanted to look, so... As to the wife, the killer got her on the staircase. As you can see, she was headed back up to protect her son I would think. And the son - he never made it out of his room. Or he ran back in there to hide. Hard to tell. And the daughter? Daughter was nine years old. Well, she was out of the house. I guess you could call her lucky. But with this being her family, I'm not sure the word lucky correctly applies. Her bed is unmade. She was here. If her bed was unmade, then she was here. Not at a sleepover. They made their beds every day. They had to make their beds every day. She was here that night. Mr. Crews. It is crews, isn't it? I'm sorry. I'll go. Why come to this place, mr. Crews? Haven't they punished you enough for what you didn't do? There were reports you had a problem with drinking at the end. You go to hell. lead detective removed rachel from report I count four blenders. Why do people always give blenders as wedding gifts? Maybe I'll get my dad a blender. He's getting married. Re-married. Maybe I'll get him a blender. And I can write on the card, "congratulations, dad. I hope you really enjoy your new blender. " you're doing that thing again where you're not really talking to me. I begged her not to marry him. He was arrested before - you know that. On assault charges. Yes, we are aware of that. I told my anna that jake was trouble. His whole family's trouble. All of his friends - all they do is drink and make trouble. Jake's lawyer eddie seems to have turned out okay. Eddie is anna's friend, detective. Not jake's. He hardly knows jake. I always thought that eddie and anna might end up together. Why is that? Eddie was so in love with her. He was always at the house. He was there for her. He was nice. Lobby apple. What? There was a big bowl of them by the front desk. The hotel wants you to take 'em. We can hear you in there. Uh, I was in the shower. Your hair's not wet. I was about to get in. Why would you say that you were taking a shower when you weren't? Hmm, eddie... You know, you didn't mention that you were anna's friend and not jake's. I am under no obligation as an attorney to mention who my acquaintances are. But you were anna's friend. So why would a friend of the victim represent the accused? That's very, uh... what's the word, crews? Enlightened. We were friends, okay? all of us. Everyone hooking up with everyone. Yeah, that is right. Hmm... Bad bed for such a nice hotel. You oughta complain about it, eddie. Look, I would like you to leave now. Everyone hooking up with everyone else, but not you. I would like both of you out of my room! Leave now! Look... I tried to throw it away, but I couldn't. I just couldn't let her go. Anna porn? Yeah, I know that looks bad. No. It doesn't look bad. It looks weird, eddie. Ve, very weird. This is porn, eddie, onto which you have pasted the dead woman's face. This is a product of an illegal search. This is a centerfold from ten years ago, eddie. You been going at this a real long time. There's a word for that kind of thing. Yeah, how's the jury gonna take that, eddie? You must've loved anna a lot. I did love her. But I didn't... Kill her. Jake did. I loved anna. A true, true love. And... I have an alibi. That's him. You sure? He paid me two grand, made me wear a blonde wig, a wedding dress, and called me anna. Yeah, I think I'd remember him. constance griffiths attorney for charlie crews How long was detective crews in prison before I took his case? Nearly eight years. And what was his emotional state wh you first met him? You'd have to ask him that. Hypothetically then. Can you speak about the emotional state of an innocent man who's been in prison for that long? Hypothetically? He gives up. Gives up on what? He gives up on life. Hey, aren't you that guy? I might be that guy. Youarethat guy. I'm tina. And I'm gina. Tina and gina. really? Really. Hey, they gave you all that money - like, what? $50 million. The amount was not disclothed. Disclosed? Yeah, that's what she said. All that money. Why are you riding the bus? What kind of a person lives in I.A. And doesn't have his own car? A crazy person. Maybe this isn't such a good idea. Oh no, no, no- it-it'll be fine, olivia. - Are you sure? - Oh, 100% sure. Well, 95... Who are they? This is a bad idea. Give me a second. Hey, ted. This is tina, and this is gina. No, I'm tina and this is gina. - Say "hi, " ted. - Hi. Tina and gina want to go swimming, isn't that right? And I said we have a pool. No, you said you have a warm pool. That's right, I did say that, didn't I? We have a warm pool, don't we, ted? I don't know. I guess we keep it about 81-82. Is that warm? Because I know some people like it around 89 or 90 but that seems hot... To me. Ted, who's that? Oh, uh, that, uh, that is olivia. And, uh... She wants to meet you. I'm very popular. See, the thing about olivia though is... That's my cell phone. Charlie. Important police business. shh. Charlie. The thing about olivia, charlie, is she's marrying your father. Detective crews. Crews, davis just called me. Jake tried to kill himself. Do you hear me? Did you hear me? He's unconscious, but he's not gonna die. She's marrying your father, and you won't return their calls so she stopped by. And she seems really nice, really. Davis is calling it murder/suicide. We're charging him when he wakes up. Come on... say something. Anything. I gotta go. Um... I gotta charge someone with murder. What? Lotta paperwork. I'm just gonna get this bus. Are we, uh... still going swimming? officer robert stark former partner of charlie crews Does it bother me that my ex-partner is now a superior? You know, I hadn't really thought of it until you went and asked the question. Is there support on the force for crews coming back on the job? On the job? That's good, that's like cops talk. Yeah, there's support. Hey, he's got a shield. he's one of us. Ha! My wife thought you weren't gonna show up. I told her, "charlie said he was coming. " he's cing. Hey, bobby. Whattaya got there? Beer. nice. Come on back. carefully, guys leslie... Three kids, huh? Done real well for yourself. Oh, yeah, real well. Why'd you come here, charlie? I thought you wanted me to come. Me? Oh, is that what he said? Look, I don't know what he told you to get you here, but I would've hoped you'd have the decency to stay away. Did you know that when you went off to prison they all thought bobby was dirty too? No one would ride with him. For four years. Did you know that? No. No one would ride with him for four years. Eat your burger and go back to your fancy house, okay? charlie. You're not going, are you? Yeah, I, uh... I just gotta get back. Yeah? okay. Yeah, no problem. You know, before you head out... There's something, uh... Well, you'll see. Something I just gotta show you. come on. Come on, tough guy. It's not gonna kill you. never know when some teenage knucklehead's gonna sneak in here, spark up a joint. Keep meaning to get that fixed. Ahh. Here it is. Oh. Here. Take it - it's yours. Oh, yeah, got your old badge here too. How'd you get these? Don't ask. Just kind of fell into my hands. Thought you might want them. Well, I don't know what to say. Say "thanks. " let's get you a burger, huh? crews. Crews! Are you with us? It's all here. Except the one thing that isn't here. Do you know what that means? Does anybody know what that means? - going home? - Yeah. My parents don't want my sister to miss any more classes. Hey tiffie, can I see your eyes? I have a bad headache. I'd rather just keep these on if that's okay. I want to apologize to you, tiffie. Why would you want to do that? Because you asked us for our help, and we didn't listen to you. I didn't ask for your help. You asked us to help you help jake. When you brought us those cameras you asked, but I wasn't listening. What is he talking about? No, I can't help anybody. Think how you would feel if jake went to prison for a crime he didn't commit. Anna loved jake. Don't you think she'd want you to save jake? How... How can I save jake? You're the only one who can. You have the answer. And you've had it all along, haven't you? Tiffany, detective crews is gonna show you some photos. We want you to look at them very closely. Okay? Maybe you can tell my sister what she should be looking for. You see it, don't you, tiffie? What is she supposed to see? They're just stupid wedding pictures. - Let me see those. - no- you're fine. See in the background there? And there by the d. J. And in this one by the wall. What are you doing in these pictures, tiffany? I'm taking pictures. In these pictures, I see you taking pictures. But I went through all the pictures, and I couldn't find any of the pictures I see you taking. Where are those pictures, tiffany? What is that, some kind of riddle? What kind of cop are you? You brought us the cameras, but did you bring us all of the cameras? Did you hold on to one? Did you hold on to your camera? Because you took a picture of something? Something you shouldn't have? Where is the camera, tiffany? He smashed it. Let me see your eyes, tiffie. I'm sorry for the inconvenience. Uh, this should not take long. Are we going to find out who did it? Okay. I was drinking. I shouldn't have been. But I felt so grown up. Where were you? Anna's room. It was me, jake, and anna. I was drinking and then I didn't feel so well, so I went to the bathroom. I woke up on the bathroom floor... And I heard voices. Two voices. Anna... And my brother, bradley. You better shut your mouth! That's one, bradley. One what? You heard voices... They were in the living room arguing - anna and bradley. Bradley was drunk. Real drunk like he gets. Mean like he gets. Don't say one more word! That's two, bradley. You don't want it to get to three, understand? It was crazy. anna was naked. She must've gotten woken up or something. Bradley was trying to steal that money. That stupid purse full of money! And she caught him. He was so drunk. And then what happened? Anna told him he was nothing. Her voice was so soft that I thought everything was gonna be okay. But it wasn't okay. It happened so fast. Bradley grabbed her by the neck. He pushed her against the wall so hard. I didn't know what to do. I looked down, and I had the camera in my hand. I took the picture... Of him standing over her. I saw it. That was three, bradley. Didn't I tell you you didn't want to get to three? He smashed the camera. He said I didn't see anything, but I did. I saw what he did to anna. Anna would be happy I saved jake. chapter seven on vengeance. Revenge is a poison meant for others that we end up swallowing ourselves vengeance is a dark light that blinds all who seek it. The untroubled soul knows there is no justice in revenge. The untroubled soul knows that to seek vengeance is to seek destruction.
