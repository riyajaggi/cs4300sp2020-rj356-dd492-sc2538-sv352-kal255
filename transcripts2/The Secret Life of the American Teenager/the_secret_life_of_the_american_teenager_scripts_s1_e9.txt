If you're gonna be involved with Amy and the baby, I don't think I can see you anymore. She's upset because I've decided to dothe responsible thing. I wanna find my father. My mom's here. She doesn't know you're not living here. Adoption is not an option. I should've told you.

 It's kind of embarrassing having Alzheimer's when you can rember it. I'm really gonna miss you. I'm not going anywhere. You know,we don'thave to go tonight if you don't want us to. I don't have to,anyway. No,you should go. You should see your dad. Why? Because he's your dad, and he asked to see you. and Amy,you need to talk to him about schools,OK, because we have to make a decision. I don't know what I wanna do about school,other than not going. Well,That's not really an option. Look,I don't understand why I can't call in sick for five months.

 Me,neither,but you can't. So Do you know where he's taking you? Where? Did he tell you not to tell me? OK,you guys have fun.OK? I'm gonna have fun. I mean I love having this house to myself. We're just gonna hang out. But hang out where? You don't even wanna leave the house. At his place.You know. He has a place now. Oh. He has a place now. Yeah,but I'm sure it's a real dump. It better be. Thanks,fellas. This was a really good idea. I don't know why you volunteered, But thank you. I just want you to be able to see your daughters. Oh,and don't tell my mom I let you do this. Are you kidding? No. She'd kill me especially since you dumped her. That's a good point. Oh,Listen up, I'll be outta here by midnight, and my guys will waiting to bring the stuff back in, I promise,all right? And I owe you big time. See ya. Here goes nothin'. The Secret Life of the American Teenager 109 It's great,Dad. Yeah,except for the fact that you got one bed for the two of us. Strange,with you owning a furniture store and all. It came furnished. It's a sublet kinda thing. You konw,I don't wanna sign a long-term lease until I know what happens with your mother and me. It's month-to-month. Besides,I thought it'd be fun if you konw you girls slept together like you did when you were kids. Yeah,Dad,great. We're not spending the night. We never agreed to that. I know,but sometime you might want to. Doubt it. So you guys wanna get some pizzaor something? You wanna go out? No,I definitely don't wanna go out. I don't wanna run into anybody I know from school or band. Amy,you're with me now. If anybody looks at you or says anything to you, I'll stick a rocket in their pocket and send 'em to the moon. Thanks,Dad. I appreciate your support. Do you mind if I call Ben? Oh,you and Ben,you're still... Yeah,we're still... Do you mind? No,go ahead. That's good.I like Ben. What? So whose place is this, your girlfriend's? What? Dad,it smells like perfume. Well,obviously girls used to live here. That's a girl's room back there. How do you know it's not a man's perfume you're smelling? Maybe it's just me you're smelling. I think we all know your smell. What kind of pizza you want? I'm not hungry. I can't go anywhere. I don't wanna go anywhere. What about if I came over there? I'd love it if you came over here, but you konw,it's kinda creepy. Feels like I'm in someone else's home. So is that a yes?Is it OK? Look,Ben,I'm dyingto see you, I really am.It's just... I don't know how this thing works. I'm pretty sure Ashley and I belong to my dad tonight. You belong to me. We belong to each other. I have to see you. I feel the same way. I have to be here for my dad. I see my mom every day.I just... I have to at least spend one night with him. I really wanna see you. It's just that... I don't know. Come on. Ask your dad. He won't mind. I can't. I don't think I can share my time with him with you. Besides,we're supposed to talk about my plans,you konw what I'msupposed to do about school stuff. But your dad likes me. I like him. And we both love you. I miss you. Ha-ha. I really miss you. Then ask him. You konw it wouldn't be fair to Ashley. What wouldn't be fair? Um,if Ben came over. No one cares. Dad wants to know what kind of pizza you want. Sausage and peppers. Hey,I'm on my way. I'll ask for your address when I pick up the pizza.OK,bye. Well? Hey. I didn't know you were coming over here. Um,listen, I gotta go drop off a pizza to Amy. She's at her dad's condo,but,uh, make yourself at home. Oh,Maybe I'll go with you. Uh,well,um... Alice had to go to hergreat-aunt's. - It's hergreat-aunt's birthday. - Oh Um. Why didn't you go with her? I didn't want to. Don't you usually go to all the family parties? Yeah,usually. Why not this one? If you don't want me to go with you,that's OK. I can just go home. No,no. It's not that I don't want you to go with me. It's just that this is Amy's first visit with her dad since her dad and her mom split up, and I probably shouldn't even be going over there,so... Is everything OK? Yeah,I'm OK. No,something's wrong. Yeah,something, but we can talk tomorrow. You go to Amy's dad's,have fun, don't worry about me. Oh,OK. Yeah, I really don't have time to talk. I gotta go get the pizza. You wanna come with? Yeah,thanks. I just wish you had told me that this is what we were gonna do. I told my parents we were getting pizza. We got pizza. It's in the back seat. I know, but I didn't tell them the whole truth, and I've already been ina lot of trouble for not telling them the whole truth. You think if we would've told 'em we were going to look for my father, they would've let you come with me? I kinda doubt it. But maybe my dad would've come with us to do this. My dad's really good at confronting people in difficult situations. Thought your parents were out on their corny date night. I don't think it's corny. I think it's kinda romantic. Please. Date night's for people who aren't having sex. Oh,my parents have plenty of sex. How do you know? I'm just assuming. Where's your brother? Where's Tom? He's home alone. It's another reason why I don't feel comfortable staying out too late. I mean he has been home by himself before,but still... I told my parents we wouldn't be gone too long. I just wanna see what the guy looks like. You konw I'm not gonna cause a big scene or anything. What? What time can I see you? I told you,I'm busy. Come on,Adrian. I can't go this long without you, or someone. Thanks. I'm sure you mean that as a compliment. Look,I told you, I can't tonight. Why not? I just can't,OK? Oh,and don't bother calling Grace. She's with me. Good night. Ricky. I,uh,talked to Jack earlier. Actually,I've talked to him all week about you. OK,I'm not sure I'm comfortable with that, but thank you for telling me. Of course I'm gonna tell you. Because we're friends,right? And Jack and I are friends. Right. I just don't get why he can call you, but he can't call me. 'Cause he's tired of being rejected, and he's waiting for you to call him. The guy is madly in love with you. Call him,take him back. I don't know. Just doesn't feel right now. Too much time has passed. Is that the problem? Too much time has passed? Or is the problem that you like Ricky? I know,you like Ricky, But you know I like Ricky, and like I told you the first time I met you We're having sex. I know that,and I'm not interested in having sex with Ricky, and he's not interested in having sex with me. We're just friends. Come on,Grace. Ricky does not have friends. Ricky makes friends with girls he wants to have sex with. Ricky and I are just friends, and he's not gonna try to have sex with me. Mm-hmm,I'm sure that's the same thing Amy Juergens was thinking the night she had sex with him. Poor Amy. No. Poor Ricky,poor baby, not poor Amy. A girl should know how to take care of herself. How hard is it not to get pregnant? I don't know. Then stay away from Ricky. Hello? Hey,what are you doing tonight? Who is this? You know who it is. Why are you calling me? I just need someone to talk to, Lauren. About what? About what else - Amy and the baby. I have to talk to someone, someone who has her best interest at heart. I'm not gonna talk to you. Why not? You didn't seem to have any trouble talking to me last week when you wanted to talk to me. Now I wanna talk to you. I'm busy. Doing what? You're not doing anything, are you? Yes,I am. Can we go out and just talk, please? You're out of your mind, you know that? - Hi. - Hi. I thought you were going out with Jason. Oh,I am. I just didn't tell my dad. Oh.Why not? I don't know. I like it better this way. You konw he just dropped me off. He thinks I'm spending the night like always. So,where's Jason taking you? To the movies, then to get a pizza. That swanky pizza joint is donating money to the school for every student who buys a pizza tonight,so... Pizza and a movie. Original. You can't go. No offense. I don't wanna go.No offense. Are you sure? I'm sure. Do you have any friends you could fix her up with? Her? Uh,no,I don't. I can get my own date. Really? I can. OK. Well,you know what? I will help you find a date next week. You got me a date. It's the least I can do. I said I can get my own date. When I'm ready,OK? OK. OK. Uh,we should go. We don't wanna wait around till she finds a date, 'cause that could take years. As much as I appreciate the pity, I don't think either one of you have been on an official date,have you? Yeah,so go. Get outta here. I got things to do. Well,good night. Good night. Good night. Who is it? Leo Boykewich. I heard you were home alone. Thought I'd drop by. Maybe we could talk. I'm Leo,Ben's dad. Anne,Amy's mom. This a bad time? No,no. Come in,please. I,uh,I should've called first,at least. I apologize. Oh,no. I apologize for looking like this. I'd go change and clean myself up a bit,but,um... I don't really feel like it 'cause... Because your mom just got diagnosed with Alzheimer's and you and your husband are having problems and your lovely daughter has gotten herself into a little bit of trouble and the girls are going to visit their dad for the first time since you split up and because that wine doesn't go with that cereal. Aw... it's OK. Everything's gonna be all right. So how do you like the pizza, Mr. Juergens? You can call me George. Could you pass me another slice,George? Not you. You call me Mr. Juergens. Mr. Juergens. That's more like it. Dad... He's kidding. Oh. It's good pizza. Oh,yeah,it's Fianno's. Fianno's? Where's Fianno's? I never heard of that. It's a place my dad likes to go to. He actually arranged this thing with the school where they donate money to the school for any business they bring in tonight. I should do that with my store. Donate money for any sales the students bring in. That's a good idea. We should bring a piece to Ashley. What's your name again? It's Henry,Dad. I'm just kidding. Why you so down,Harry? What's up? Girlfriend problems. Thanks. Girlfriend break up with you? Did she? No. No. You ever meet Amy's sister? No. Oh. She is the shyest little girl just a couple years younger t han you three but the sweetest,nicest cherub you'd ever wanna meet. You konw when she heard you and Ben were coming over, she ran to the back room like a scared little kitten. Hey,do me a favor. Would you bring my little angel a slice of pizza. Oh. OK. Thanks,Harry. What do you want? Your dad asked me to bring you some pizza. Put it down,then back out of the room with your hands over your head. No. I won't back out of the room with my hands over my head, because I'm tired of people telling me what to do and when to do it and when not to do it. I'm a man,damn it. Well,in that case,ou can stay. Well,OK. Who is it? - It's Ricky. - Ricky? Hey,buddy. Hey. Is Grace home? No. She's out with Adrian. Really? Your parents let her go out with Adrian? Maybe I could wait for her. I have a friend coming over. You have a friend coming over? Like a date? Good for you. Do you have any idea where Grace and Adrian went? Maybe they are at Adrian's house. Yeah,maybe they are. Thanks. Maybe you should write him a letter first. Maybe. Or maybe you should call him and see how he feels about meeting you. Maybe. Adrian,I'm sorry. I don't feel comfortable doing this. I think we should go. I've waited 16 years for this. You can't wait another few minutes? OK. What exactly are we waiting for? I just wanna see the guy,OK? How do you even know it's the right guy? Finally!! Sorry,Tom. Busy night. The high school gets credit for every pizza any student orders tonight. It's been a little crazy. Yeah. Here you go. Tom,that's a lot of money. You want more? Oh,no. I'm just saying, careful with your cash. Thanks for the tip. Ha-ha. Thanks for the tip. I get it. Funny. Good Night,Tom. Hello. Hi,Tom. It's me. I'm checking to see how you are. I'm fine. Do you need me to come home? No. Are you sure? Yes. I just thought you might be scared there all by yourself. No. He says he's OK, but I don't know. Look,I know this is really hard for you, but what if the the guy sees us sitting outside his house? Feel better now? Yeah. Haven't really had anyone to talk to. I mean,I don't know. What are we gonna do,Anne? They're in love. It's wonderful they're in love, but they're just 15 years old. It's complicated. Or not. She's gonna be a mother. We accept that,Ben and me. He wants her in his life and I want her in his life. She's a nice girl. Thank you. I think I'm just still in shock. I don't understand it. It seems so unlikely that she would... Have sex,yeah. I think most of us feel that way about our children, our teenagers. I spoke to the counselor at school. Marc Molina,yeah. Nice guy. He said there's an extension class she can go to with other girls who are... Is that what you want? No. I want this not to be happening. But it is,and it's gonna be happening whether she goes to extension class or she's home schooled or goes back to her old school. Oh,I don't think Amy could do that. She could if she wanted, if you wanted. I can't even get her to leave the house anymore. She's gotta get over that. She can't hide her face in shame. What happened happened. Like I said before,she's a good girl, and I mean that. She is. She is a good girl. And you're a good mother, and you'll get through this and Amy will get through this. But don't let her hide from people, and don't you hide from people. Don't make it so important. It is what it is,you know? You want me to get her a private tutor so she could stay home and get her schooling, and I'll do it. You want to send her to a private school or-or a different school, just let me know I got connections. But,please,don't let Amy feel like she's any less of a person than she was before this happened, Because she's not, and neither are you. Just live with it,Anne. If you don't mind me sayin' that,just live with it. Because there's nothing you could do. Just accept that things are what they are, and that's OK. And if I could help you in any way,please, just let me know. Thanks. So,did you wanna talk or something,or... are you just content to sit there and stare at me? I'm OK just staring at you. I don't guess that,uh,at 13, you're allowed to date or anything? Are you kidding? After Amy,I don't think I'll be allowed to date till I'm 21 unless I undergo some voluntary sterilization or something. That would be a shame. Why is that? I don't know. You're really pretty. Come on. Well,I mean,you know you're pretty,right? I mean,you're beautiful. You may be the most beautiful girl I've ever seen. Just shut up,OK? You don't know that? Please - Please don't tell anyone,OK? Never. I've-I've been through a lot lately. I love Stephane Grappelli. - You do? - Yeah,I love him. Oh,with,uh, what's his name? Uh,oh, - Django Reinhardt. - Reinhardt. - Yeah. - Yeah. Oh,God. Amazing. Yeah. I don't think there's anything like the two of them. Unless it's the two of us. Who? Uh,Stephane Grappelli and Django Reinhardt? They're jazz musicians. Or, they used to be. Yeah,I know who they are. - No,you don't. - Oh,yeah. Stephane Grappelli is on a Pink Floyd album - Wish You Were Here. - It's true. - Dad. - Pink Floyd? - Look it up,cool cat. - OK. - Dad. What? Let's just change the subject. So,have you thought any more about coming back to school? Oh,yeah. No,I can't do that. Well, other than home schooling, what are your options? Should I be here while you and Ben are discussing your educational future? Right. Um,that's probably something you'd like to discuss with Amy and her mother without me. Maybe I'll just go find out what happened to Henry, and maybe we'll be going. Maybe. But it's been great seein' ya. I'm sorry. Probably should have asked if Ben could come over. No,it's OK. I just wanna spend a little time with you and Ashley myself. What do you think's goin' on in there? I don't know. Look,Amy,I know high school students stink, but that's your school. And if you wanna go back to your school instead of being sent out to the edge of the village for some extension class or something, then claim your rights. You go back to school with Ben and your friends, and you hold your head up high. I want to. Dad,I can't. I really - I can't. I'm not that brave. Yes,you are. And you're already past the worst part of this. You told me. Now that I know,everything else is a piece of cake. No. It isn't. Kids at my school are mean. You're not mean. You're a little bit - You're a little opinionated about some things but you're not mean And you love me. Kids at my school do not love me. I do,Amy. I love you very much. And Ashley and... even your mother. But... I've made some mistakes. Yep. So have I,Dad. Oh,sweetie. Oh,uh,I'll get that. It's probably a neighbor. No one knows I've moved in yet. Adrian,it's me. I brought you and Grace a pizza. Is that Ricky? Adrian? I really didn't think this through. Adrian? Dad,you're dating Adrian? Adrian's mother is a friend of mine. Well,she was a friend of mine. I said I'd made some mistakes. People make mistakes. I told my mom you were bringing by a book I need to write my paper. I don't have a book. Yeah,you do. Nice work. I brought you a pizza. I'm not hungry. Suit yourself, but I got it for you. Yeah,sure you did. And I'm sure you just wanna talk. I do. I'm not doing anything with you. I'm not asking you to do anything with me but talk. So start talking. My girlfriend -or ex-girlfriend Adrian hates me. Amy hates me. Everyone hates me. So? So I think more people will hate me if I have to walk the hallways with a pregnant Amy Juergens walkin' the same hallways. So I was just thinkin', can't you convince Amy it's not a good idea for her to come back to school? You know it's not a good idea. Because her continuing her education will cut into your social life. Yeah. But I don't want her ridiculed. I don't want anyone makin' fun of the woman carrying my child. Look,no one's gonna say anything to me 'cause... I'm me. But Amy... she's a movin' target. Well,what do you know? We agree on something. Yeah. I don't even know why she decided to have the baby. We both know we made a mistake. We both know we're not ready to be parents. Now I'm forced into takin' care of her, takin' care of both of 'em. Guess you should have been more careful. I should have been more careful, she should have been more careful. Yeah,you both should have been more careful, but you weren't. Now you are both responsible for bringing a child into this world. Jealous? Oh,yeah,I am jealous because I am dying to be a teenaged mother,because that's what every girl wants to be. I meant are you jealous that I had sex with her? No. Are you sure? Kinda got the impression from you and Madison that you're both jealous. You know, not every girl wants you. Yeah,some girls think you are an uncaring,heartless jerk. Some girls,yeah. Come on. I'm not a total jerk,am I? What's a girl as good-lookin' as you doin' home on a Saturday night alone anyway? I see right through this, you know that? I know that. And still,here you are. - Well.. - Hi.. Well,hi yourself. Are you Tom? Are you Betty? Yeah,I'm Betty. You know,it's gonna cost you money if you want me to be your friend,you know. OK. I just have a feeling something is going on. I really have to go home,Adrian. If I'm not home by midnight, my parents are gonna kill me. Oh,Lord, keep us safe from harm. Hi there. Hi. My wife says you've been parked out here all night. What do you want? Adrian? Yeah? Are you Adrian Lee? Yeah. My agreement with your mother is that this would never happen. Please don't come around here again. I have a family. - Hey. - Hey. Oh,God,you too? What do you mean, "you too"? You're cheating on Dad? Leo,Ben's Dad, came by. Why? I don't know. He just wanted to make sure that I knew that he was OK with you and Ben going out. He came over just to tell you that? Couldn't he just call or send some sausage servant to tell you? Let's get back to "you too." Is your father dating someone? Did he bring someone over while you guys were there? No. But he is dating.I mean, or he was,anyway. Who? You know. He's having an affair with Adrian's mother. You know,Adrian,the slut, the majorette,drummer's girlfriend. Slut must run in the family. You know what,Ashley? Dad said that he would tell her. Mom,Dad's not having an affair. He's not even dating anyone. They might have dated, like, once or twice, but they're just friends. He borrowed her condo so we could hang out tonight. When do you stop being so gullible? When the baby arrives? Ashley. Why can't you both just be like normal parents and get addicted to Internet orn or something? Why do you have to get involved with other parents? What about you, princess? Why do you have to get involved with my friends' friends? Henry has a girlfriend. Alice and him have been dating since third grade. She broke up with him. Alice broke up with Henry? Damn it,I'm no better than Madison and Lauren. I don't want you two girls using that kind of language,OK? Mom,I'm pregnant,and you're worried I'm gonna use bad words? Yes.No. I... I don't know what I'm saying,OK? I just found out that your father has a girlfriend. It's one thing to suspect something like that. It's another thing to have it confirmed by your own daughters. He made a mistake. He said that? To you? Yes. Mom,Adrian's mom is out of town all the time. She's a flight attendant. She travels a lot. Somehow Dad convinced Adrian to let us borrow her condo 'cause he knew I didn't want to go out anywhere. He just did it for me because he knew I didn't want anyone to see me like this. Besides,Dad's just living at the furniture store. Wait,What?When did he say that? He didn't tell me that. Yes,cause you were hiding in the back room like a little baby. Maybe if you hadn't acted like a child all night, you would have known. You think you're so grown up just 'cause you're having a baby. OK,stop it. Wait. Wait a minute. He's living in the furniture store? Why isn't he staying in a hotel,or an apartment or Oh,no. No! No,no,no. Mom? Dad's not living with Adrian's mom. OK? He's not. Oh,no. What? Dad didn't,um, mention anything about being broke, did he? What? Well,why else would he be living at the furniture store? OK,Mom,you have to let him come home. I don't mind people knowing that she's having a baby and he's having an affair and you're doing whatever with Ben's dad, but I do mind people knowing that we're poor. That is the ultimate humiliation. What,are we so poor that he has to sleep at his own store? Please,Mom,just let him come home. Please. I don't understand why you guys think he's broke or we're broke or whatever. Maybe Dad just enjoys sleeping at his furniture store. Now you see how she got in trouble. Just when I thought things could not get any worse. Mom,You have to go get him. You cannot let him display our poverty to the public,OK? It's just - I can take a lot of things, but I cannot take that. I just cannot. But,Ashley, I don't want him here.OK? I really don't want him here. Mom,I hate him as much as you do,OK? But we can't just make him look like a big loser. We're all gonna look like big losers. Is that what you want?The whole world is gonna pity us. Ashley,I can't. Not after everything that he's done. I just can't. Mom,I am asking you. Let him come home. It's just for a while,please. Please. OK,Ashley, but I'm not calling him,OK? You have to call him. And it's just till we figure something else out. The refreshments are delicious. Oh,yes. No smoking. It's bad for you. Oh,I know, but believe me, this is not the most dangerous part of my job. I mean,I hope I live long enough to die of lung cancer. Want one? Have you smoked before? No. Oh,you know what? Yeah,you know, it might make you sick,Tom. It's very addictive. You smoke one,you know, seems like nothing. You smoke another one. Ah,no big deal. Then you smoke a third one. Blammo,you're hooked. And it is very, very difficult to quit. That's a good idea. Tom,I need you to know something. If you don't p me the money, a very mean guy is gonna come and beat you up with a bag of oranges that he keeps in his trunk. So you need to pay me the money. I gotta pay him. He doesn't let me keep the money,you know. I didn't know that. Yeah. Well,now you know,and that's what friends are for - to tell you stuff like that. You wanna know something else? OK. OK. Well,lots of the girls are addicted to drugs, all kinds of terrible, terrible drugs. And that's why they need the money. It's a very, very dirty business, and most of the men who call me, they're not very nice. And if they were nice, they would have,like,a girlfriend or a - or - right? - or a wife or something,right?But they don't. You really hit the jackpot when you got me. Yeah,but there's a lot of other girls on the website that - they're not nice. They don't care about you, and they're not your friend. And they'd come into your beautiful home,and they rob your family. So will you do me a favor? Will you stay away from those websites? 'Cause someone's gonna take advantage of you. Will you promise me? I love my sausage pizza. And I really liked our conversation. That's gonna be $200. Hi. Thank you. Tom? Who's this? Here,take that back. How are you? Good night,Tom. - Beautiful home. - Oh,thanks. Tom,who is that? She's a friend. Like Ricky. He came here tonight. Really? What'd he say? What was he wearing? So when are you gonna break up with Alice? I don't know, but the sooner,the better. Maybe you should sleep on it. Maybe you'll feel differently tomorrow. No,I want it over with. I want it over with by tomorrow. You've known her since the third grade.This is Alice. She's just not somebody you "get over with." Not everyone is as lucky as you are. Some people get stuck in relationships they don't want to be in just because they're too scared to let go of it, I don't wanna be like that. I'm too young to be like that. If I'm never as lucky as you, if I never find someone, if I never fall in love, then... at least I will have tried to get what you have. The perfect girl,who's pregnant by some other guy. I'm sorry,Ben. I forgot for a minute. It's OK. You're not changing your mind,are you? No. Never. She hasn't even tried to call me. She totally takes me for granted, and I'm tired of it, I'm just tired of it. Then break up with her, but be nice about it. I mean,Alice is tough on the outside, but she's gonna be really upset. You know that,right? I know,I know, but what can I do? I can't do this anymore, and I have to break up with her. I have to. OK. What? Alice didn't by chance break up with you,did she? Yeah. Hey. Your friend Ricky dropped by. Blew my cover. Let me ask you something. How does a guy stay married to a woman for 15 years and have two daughters with her and then just walk away Have we ever had a conversation? I don't think so, so I don't think we'll be starting with that one. Why not? I wanna know. Why do you wanna know? Because that's what my father did. He just walked away, and he never looked back. And he knows I'm here -he knows - and he acts like I don't even exist. Oh,Adrian,oh,honey,it's OK. Don't cry. Don't cry. You got your mother. She'll be home in a couple of days. It's one thing to cheat on Mom. It's another thing to cheat on Amy and me. I'm never gonna speak to you as long as I live,you got it? Tell him he can stay at the house if he can't afford to stay anywhere else and if he isn't still with your mother and if he's... really living at the store. I left my cell phone in your room. Go home. What's the point now? The point is if you want forgiveness, eventually they'll forgive you. If my father ever came to me and asked me to forgive him, I would forgive him. Not me. Good night.
