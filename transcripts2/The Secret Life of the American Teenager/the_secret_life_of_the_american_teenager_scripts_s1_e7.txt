 Previously on "The Secret Life of the American Teenager"... I'm... pregnant? Amy, you can't be pregnant. Maybe we should think about adoption. If I did end up having the baby, do you think I could get married? Married? Yeah. Ben said he would marry me. What's the matter with my girl? She's pregnant, George. I don't think it would be too smart if Amy actually had your baby, do you?

 What? What baby? You mean she's having an abortion? This is not your problem. This is my problem. If your decision is not to have the baby, you really should talk to your parents. Who's this Ritchie character, anyway? Ricky. He's in the band. You've seen him. He's that drummer that's always showing off. This girl I don't even know and care nothing about is gonna ruin my life. You think Amy wanted this to happen? Grace, I regret what I did, and I apologize. I take full responsibility for my actions. That's more than Ricky's ever gonna do for Amy. Things are what they are, and we're gonna have to figure them out.

 Do you think I made the right decision? I think that you made the right decision for you. I'm gonna drop your sister off at school and hit the road. You're sure you're OK talking to your dad alone? Yeah. I don't mind talking to him alone. I just mind him looking at me. You look fine. You don't even look that different. No, Mom. Look at me. I'm huge, and I'm gonna get more huge. It's OK, Amy.  Your dad loves you, and so do I, and so does your sister. You don't have to go away. I don't mind asking your grandmother if you can stay with her. I don't even mind telling her why you want to stay with her, but you don't have to stay with her. You can stay here. Mom... let me go. You said I could go. You promised me. I know, Amy, but I can't imagine not seeing you every day, being with you through all this. I don't want you to see me like this. I don't want anyone to see me like this. I just....I wanna do this all alone. But you're not alone. We're alone. Finally. Mom's been waiting for you. You're gonna be late for school. Yeah, well, at least I'm not gonna be late for my period. Ashley, apologize. Fine. I apologize. But you know she's pregnant. I don't see why some good can't come of it. Why can't you make Dad come home and have him help? I'm not even gonna be here, Ashley. I thought you two were getting along. I thought you and Dad were getting along. We're talking about Amy. That's all we ever do is talk about Amy. Can't we talk about Dad for once? Your dad is the one who decided to leave. Dad decided to leave. Amy decided to leave. Maybe I'll decide to leave. Can I go live with him? May I go live with him? Let's go. So... that isn't a no. www.1000fr.com presents  Capture:FRM@Evelyn~zx Sync:FRS@greenBB VinE  The Secret Life of the American Teenager S01E07 I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. Why can't you mother clean out the coffeemaker? No. Dad... I meant... No. Sweetie, don't do that, all right? You been crying for weeks. Come on. It's OK. OK, it's not OK, but... I just don't know how this happened. I mean how'd it happen, Amy? How is this possible? Sex? I guess I should've talked to you more about personal stuff. Guys. Where babies come from. But... you really think you wanna go away and live with your grandmother? I mean, you think that's the best thing? Yeah. Was that your idea or your mom's idea? I don't wanna stay here, Dad. I don't wanna face everybody. What about Ben? I still wanna marry him, but... but Mom still thinks it's a bad idea. What do you think? Do you have any new thoughts on that? Maybe later... when you're 30. Yeah. When the baby's my age - 15. Honey, everything's gonna be OK. These things happen. Mainly when guys talk young girls into doing things they shouldn't. It's not all his fault. I just let it happen. No, it's his fault. He knew what he was doing. And this Ricky guy - he knows about this? Yeah, he knows. But you haven't talked to him face to face. No. I don't want anything to do with that guy. Little late for that. After yo u have the, um...  child, then what? I don't know. I can't think about that right now, Daddy. You haven't called me that in so long, baby. Aw, Amy... Oh. Maybe it really is time for me to come home. So, what are you gonna do? I'm not gonna do anything. Have you talked to her? No, I haven't talked to her. Well, talk to her. I don't wanna talk to her. I don't want anything to do with her. You've already had something to do with her, son. You are not my dad. You're right, I'm not, but I've tried to be a good father to you, and now you're gonna be a father, so... what kind of father are you gonna be? It's time to have a conversation. Go talk to her, today, this morning before you go to school. I'm already late, and don't you think if she wanted to talk to me, she'd come talk to me? She knows where to find me. We have band together. So is she gonna stay in school? How would I know? Wait, how could she stay in school? She does have that option. She's not gonna come to school when she's having a baby. Can't you do something about that? What would you want me to do? Aren't you a social worker? Yes. And I encourage teenage mothers to stay in school. Are you kidding me? No, I am not kidding you, Ricky. I encourage you to take responsibility for whatever happens to this baby. Not exactly the responsible type and neither is she, thus the baby. Any word yet? We're running out of time. We gotta get you to school. I haven't heard anything yet. All I know she wants to leave town. It's not that far away to grandmother house. We can drive up on the weekends and see Ames. She doesn't want us to see her. Or at least she doesn't want me to see her. Is that crazy, or what? She's scared, Ben. I mean she's scared and she's angry and she's overwhelmed. Do her and yourself a favor and go along with the plan, whatever it is. Of course, whatever it is is probably gonna change  over and over and over again. It's just not easy, that's all. What in life is easy? Not much, that's what. Certainly not the sausage business. Come on, we better get going. Dad... I know, you wanna stay home. I'm pretty sure your mother would want you to go to school. I don't think she would. All right, stay home, as long as it's for one day. You don't wanna stay home and hang out with me? No. Can't do, I'd rather stay busy. And besides... I'm pretty sure you don't have any intention  of hanging around the house all day. Am I wrong? No. Call her, text her, do something. Let me know what happens. Hello. I love you. Me too. Is he still there? No, he's gone. Then what's the decision? Decision? Are you goin'? Yeah. I'm going to my grandmother's. I thought maybe your dad would say no. I think that's kinda up to me to decide, don't you? Ben, you can't decide for me. I have to go. I can't stay. Stay with me, at my house. I mean just say you're going to your grandmother's, and live with me and my dad. I can't do that. I don't want you to see me, either. I have to see you. I'll die if I don't see you. OK, please don't say that. We both know you're not gonna die. It makes me feel like you're threatening to kill yourself. OK, one - "I'll feel really bad if I don't see you" doesn't express my true feelings, and two - I think you're aware that when you lose a parent, it makes you value your own life, so I have no intention of offing myself. I totally just forgot about your mom. Say something, please? You really think going to your grandmother's is the only solution? No, I don't think there is any solution, but I do think it'll make things easier. Ben, this isn't easy. What is? Not much, that's what. What? Nothing. Why is it going to be easier for people to see you after you've had the baby? Either way, they know. Just don't care if they know. Don't care. You can decide that, you know, to not care what people think. Who doesn't care what people think? Me. I don't care. Come on, Amy. At least consider going back to school. I'll be right there with you, holding your hand. I already told you I can't. They're a bunch of high school students. Ben, I'm going to my grandmother's. You can come over tonight and say goodbye if you want. I'll probably leave in the morning. No. Thanks for asking, but, no, I don't wanna say goodbye, because I don't want you to leave. Who is it? It's me. What are you doing here? Come on, let's stay home today. I can't. Why? 'Cause I don't want to. All right. Can I stay here? I'm not in the mood to go to school today. You can't stay here. Is your mom home? You know she's not. Come on, Adrian. I can't go to school today. I can't. Sedlack will kill you if you don't make practice. I'm already missing practice, and I don't care about band. Can I come in? I need you. Oh, come on. My life is falling apart. I need you. Really. Just take a day off. Call in sick, stay in bed. Mnh-mnh. I have to turn in my English Lit paper. Turn it in tomorrow. No. I worked really hard on it. I'm not gonna get points taken off just 'cause I didn't turn it in on time. OK, I'll come back at lunch, after English Lit. You can stay, but I have to go. What are you doing home? Come on, you didn't think I was actually going to school. We're parent-free. So, how'd it go with Dad? I don't know. He cried, and I cried... Yeah, and? And he wants to come home. Thank you. Finally. Just because he says that does not mean she'll let him. And aren't you concerned you're gonna get in trouble for ditching school? Yeah. Guess I kinda lowered that bar. Thank you for that, too. Don't you think you're taking this whole thing a little too seriously? It's not like you're dying. You're just having a baby. Just? Just having a baby? Ashley, I'm 15. I don't wanna have a baby. I just wanna be normal like everyone else. I wanna go to a normal school and be in the band and go to high school dances and fall in love and get married and then maybe have a baby. Then why did you have sex? I don't know. I didn't... think about it. I didn't have a good reason. I just did it. Ashley, promise me that you won't have sex until marriage. Please. Not one of your fake promises to Mom and Dad. A real promise.  I don't want you to make the same mistake I did. Are you kidding? I have condoms. I'm not an idiot. You have condoms at 13? Where did you get condoms? The grocery store. You are not using condoms. Now there's some really bad advice. OK, you know what I mean, Ashley. You don't need condoms. Just say no. That doesn't work, obviously. I didn't say no. I didn't say anything. I just let this happen. I cannot believe I let this happen to me. Ashley, just listen to me. You do not wanna have a baby. Not at 13. That's why I have the condoms. When did you even get condoms? I dunno. Right after I found out you were pregnant. It's not like they're illegal. Anyone can buy 'em. Why are you in such a bad mood this morning? I thought it was because Dad was coming over, but that's obviously not it. I'm not in a bad mood. Yeah, you're right. You're in an angry mood. What, are you angry at that guy Ricky? No. I'm just angry with myself. No, that's not it. What, is it Ben? God, how can you be angry with a guy who loves you despite the fact that you're pregnant by another guy? I just can, OK? Well, it's a step up from feeling sorry for yourself. Change your mind? Who are you? A friend of Adrian's. I didn't break in or anything, honest. Are you breaking in? I got a key. What's your name? I recognize you. Ricky Underwood. Oh, yeah, I know you. And you are? I'm Amy's dad. Don't you hit me. If you hit me, I'll hit ya back, I swear. Why would I hit you? Oh, no. I know. I know, all right. And I'd like to hit you, but if I started hitting you, I don't think I could stop. 'Cause I wanna kill you. But for one - I don't feel like going to prison for killing the likes of you, not that I couldn't get away with it, because believe me, people would understand. And two - I don't wanna lose any business for killing the likes of you. Because you know I'm the one who would end up paying for whatever happens here. Which brings me to three - I wanna talk to you. So you listen up. I don't want you involved in anything that my daughter decides. Is that clear? You have no part in the decision-making process whatsoever. And whatever decision Amy and her mother and I make, that's it. That's the decision. Not yours. You have nothing to say. No, of course not. It's her baby. Don't be an idiot. It's your baby, too. But you're not gonna have anything to do with it, ever. If she wants to put it up for adoption, you're gonna sign when you have to sign. OK. And if she ends up keeping it... and she doesn't want you around, you're not around. But believe me, you're gonna pay for that baby for the rest of his or her life. You, not me. You. And that money doesn't entitle you to a thing. You give up all rights to anything and everything when you take advantage of an innocent 15-year-old girl. I understand, and I'm OK with all that. Band camp. That's what people do nowadays at band camp, they have sex? It just happened. Sex doesn't just happen. I'm a man. I know how hard it is to get a woman to have sex. Why do you have a key to Adrian's condo? It's not her condo, it's her mother's condo. I'm... putting some new furniture in for her mother. I came by to measure a room, not that it's any of your business. No, but I notice you feel comfortable here. You opened a new jar of mayonnaise. Are you seeing Adrian's mother? You're the boyfriend? Let's just stick with the furniture story. What, you got a problem telling a little white lie, but you don't mind ruining my daughter's life? 'Cause you ruined her life. You realize that, don't you? You ruined her life, her sister's life, her mother's life, and my life, not to mention the life of an innocent child. I don't think I've ruined anybody's life. Why aren't you at school? 'Cause I don't feel like having people stare at me all day. So, what, you gonna drop out of school, then? No, I'm not dropping out. I can't just drop out of school. I'd like to, but I can't. Why not? Why can't you drop out or go to another school? Amy's gonna have to go to another school. Why shouldn't you? Oh, that's right. Because people can see that she's having a baby, but you, you just get to walk around like the worthless piece of trash that you are. You stay away from my daughter and you keep your mouth shut about me and Adrian's mom. No one knows about that but me, her and Adrian. And now you. I'm not a worthless piece of trash! *The feelings all roll back As I flip another page* *It's funny how back then I'd dream of better days, but when it all...* Hi, Adrian. Did you say something? Hi. Hi what? I wanted to apologize for the way I talked to you at that clinic. I was in a panic. You were on a mission. I was. I still believe what I believe, but maybe I could've handled the whole thing better. We can have a difference of opinion and be friends. That little skirmish at the clinic and a difference of opinion... that's what you think is keeping us from being friends? How about we're not friends because...  your boyfriend and I hooked up? I've forgiven him. What? I don't know if we'll date again, but regardless of that, I've forgiven him. And... I forgive you. Who are you to forgive me? You're exactly right, who am I to forgive you? Forgiveness belongs to God, so I'm forgetting what happened between you and Jack. I have the power to do that, to forget, to just... let it go. It still happened. What happened? I hooked up with Jack. You did? I forgot. You haven't forgotten. You can't. I don't think you can forget I think it would've been a good idea if Amy decided not to have a baby. Maybe if we were friends, we could talk about that sometime. Or even if we can't be friends, maybe we can at least speak in the hallway without it being a big deal like it is now. I don't see any reason why we have  to have hard feelings between us. OK, what is it? You think that if you're  friends with me, you could still hang out with Ricky, is that it? I can hang out with Ricky, anyway, if I want to. Your Christian parents are gonna  let you hang out with a guy that got a 15-year-old girl pregnant? I guess. A guy like that needs friends now, don't you think? No, I don't think. The only friend he needs is me. OK. But don't you need a friend? You're the girlfriend of a guy who got a 15-year-old girl pregnant. The whole situation is so sad, I think. Must be so tough on both of them, having a baby so young. He's not having a baby. She's having a baby. And I hear she's  leaving town to do it, so she's not gonna be around anymore. It's over for her and Ricky. You don't think at some point Ricky's gonna wanna see his own baby or be involved with his child as he or she grows up? Nope. I can't imagine Ricky would never wanna see his own child. That's 'cause you live with two parents. Most families aren't like that. Every child has two parents. I don't. Bye. Call me sometime. We'll talk. Or just drop by. You don't have to call. I'm not nothin'. He has no right to talk to me like that. I'm a human being. I'm as good as he is. I could've punched that guy. But you came here instead to talk it out, so you didn't punch him. That doesn't mean I won't. -I think it does. -No, it doesn't. The next time he or anyone else tells me I'm trash, I'm gonna punch 'em. No, you're not. Didn't I just say I was? I'm not gonna let anyone talk to me like that ever again. Because you're not trash. You're a man. You're somebody. What are you sayin'? I'm pourin' my  guts out, and you're mocking me? I'm not mocking you at all. I'm agreeing. I don't know what you're talking about. Half the time I'm here, I don't know what  you're talking about or who you're talking to. That's because up until now, you didn't know who you are. -Who am I? -You're a man. As good as Amy's dad, as good as anyone else. You're a human being. No matter how you've been treated before in this life, you are a human being, and human beings make mistakes. How can I be a man who's as good as everyone else when I made the mistake of getting a girl pregnant? A 15-year-old girl is pregnant because of me, and I don't care about her or the baby. All I care about is that her father called me trash, and I'm not trash. -Because? -Because I'm not. That is as good an  answer as any. You're the doorway to self-respect. Open it, Ricky. Open it and go on in. I don't know how. I think you do. Hello. Anyone home? Came home from school for this? -Yeah, it's me. What do you want? -Where are you? Leave a message, not that I'll call you back. So I came home. Where are you? Adrian? What are you doing here? -What are you doing here? -I live here. Why aren't you at the furniture store? I brought you something. -It's all set, boss. -Thanks, fellas. -You brought me something? -Yeah. Something for you and your mom. -I don't want anything from you. -Fine. I'll take it back. At least take a look at it first. Why would you get me a desk? What am I gonna do with a desk? I see you studying at the kitchen  counter, on the couch, all over the place. Thought you might like a desk. What do you want? -Nothin'. -No, you want something. -You all want something. -All? Oh, OK, I get it. You don't want me to say anything to Amy. Of course I don't want you  to say anything to Amy. I don't want you to say anything to anyone. But this isn't a bribe, it's a gift. So... did you get my mother a new desk, too? No, an armoire. Oh... Top-of-the-line armoire. It was made in India. Goodbye, George. Goodbye? You're breaking up with her, aren't you? What are you talking about? All the last guy gave us was a box of steaks. I knew you were smart. That's why I got you the desk. Just leave. Just so you know, Ricky was here earlier. I came by to get some things, and he was here.  Be careful.OK? Or what? I'll end up pregnant? -Everyone knows. -All right. Is that why you're  going home? That's none of your business. Guys would like you anyway, you know that, right? What do you mean, anyway? Even if you don't have sex with 'em. And that's none of your business. You're welcome for the desk. Hey, jerk. I'm sorry. My day took a weird turn. Yeah, so did mine. You coming over or not? Nah. Something I have to do. Amy's father said he talked to you. He's not trying to force you to marry her, is he? No. Pretty much the opposite. Look, I can't ignore the fact that I'm the father of a baby. Sure you can. Lots of guys do. Lots of guys? Like who? Like my father. I didn't know. You do what you have to do. I don't care. Yeah, ya do care, and I know you were counting on me to come over, and I'm sorry. I'm gonna start being more responsible. I just have to take care of something. Look, I don't need you to come over. I have friends. No, you don't. Call her back? Yeah, called her back. Good. That's a start. What's next? Hi. Hi. I didn't know you guys were stopping by during school hours, uninvited. Your dad called. He thought maybe you needed some company. No, that's fine. Thank you, though. Did you hear from Amy? -Is she... -Leaving? I guess so. Are you going over to her house to say goodbye? No. No. I can't. You have to say goodbye. Doesn't matter. She'll be back. Yeah, eventually. She doesn't want me to see her, either, when she gets... bigger. Like that would matter to me. All right, you guys make yourselves at home. Want some company? No. I got my dad's driver for company, but thanks. Sweet. We can't just stay here when Ben's not here. Yeah, we can. We're his best friends. Yeah, which is why he left us his  room for the first time ever. Have we ever been in here alone? Is this a set-up? -No, I swear. -I'm not having sex. Is that why you wanted me to come here, to have sex? It's pretty much why I do everything - to have sex. But we don't have sex. But we could if we wanted. I have a condom. You think because we're in high school,  we're supposed to have sex? I don't know about supposed to, but I'd really like to, and you said you wanted to take the next step, right, before, when you decided, so now I decided. By next step, I didn't mean actual intercourse. I meant next step. Yeah, and I think we took that next step. Please, Alice. Maybe on your birthday, if you don't beg. I hate begging. My 16th birthday? Oh, no.  I don't know why I said that. No, probably not. -But maybe. -No. -Come on, say maybe. -No. -I already said I hate begging. -OK, I hear ya. I can live with no. You'll have to. When we get older and we do get  married and we do have sex, I bet it's going to be really good sex. Most people don't have good sex. 52% of Americans 16 and older are not fully satisfied with their sex lives. But we're not like most people. How can you look at me and still wanna have sex? How can I look at you and not wanna have sex? But I'm a man, and I can take no for an answer. Good, because you'll have to, at least for a few more birthdays or until I decide otherwise. Amy, it's me. -Oh, no. -Who's me? It's Ricky. Can I talk to you? No, no, no. Uh, is Amy home? I'm her friend Ricky. Could we talk? I don't know. I talked to your dad earlier, or he talked to me. My dad? Look, Ricky, I'm not sure I really wanna talk to you now. I'm not sure I wanna talk to you, but we have to talk. No, we don't have to talk. Are your parents home? Why? If they're not, I'll come back and talk to you when one of them is here, either your mom, your dad, or both. I think it's best if we have a chaperone, parent-type chaperone, maybe not in the same room, but in the house, anyway. What do you even wanna talk about? She knows. I know everything, and I have condoms. I'll come back. Considering our situation, I'd like to have one of your parents here. I'd like to talk before you leave town. Are you leaving? That's the rumor around school. Maybe.  Did you say you actually talked to my dad earlier? Yeah, and I made some promises to him I don't think I can keep. Like? Like I think I do wanna be involved. Seriously? Involved? I'm the father of this child, and I think I should have some say in what happens here. Just call me when I can come over and talk to you, OK? OK, now I see how it happened. She's beautiful, don't you think? I know we're a little young, and... she's a little pregnant... ...but I'm really in love, and I don't think she understands that. If she did, I don't think she'd  be running off to her grandmother's house. This is the woman I wanna spend the rest of my life with. She says she feels the same way about me, but... I don't know. Of course, it's complicated, but life is complicated. Heh. I sound like Dad, don't I? Except Dad would add, "Sausage is complicated." Probably.  That's not her, you know. It's her. Nah, that's the container that holds  the container that used to be her. Is this the first time you've come to see her since we said goodbye to her? It is, yeah. I don't like coming here. But I didn't come for her, I came for you. Why do you come here every year on the anniversary of her death? Why do you do this to yourself every year? 'Cause every day would be too often. Life is for the living, son. You can talk to the deceased but not the living? Join the living. If Amy's leaving and going to her grandma's, then that's what's happening. Do you won't be together for the rest of your lives. It means she's going away for a while. For a while. Get it? She's not leaving forever. She's choosing to go. Mom, she didn't have a choice, but Amy is... You can't have your way on this one, Benjamin. Jue I couldn't have my way on that one. Live with it. I'm really happy you stopped by. And surprised. Yes, we're very happy. We're very happy. We've heard so much about you. From me. That's why we are surprised. Yeah. I remember the other time I was surprised to see you. Why don't we just let that go, Tom? Let it go. Really. We're really happy you stopped by. I didn't have your number. I don't usually just stop by anywhere. I don't even know why I did this. Maybe it's because I asked if you wanted to be friends. I'd really like to be friends. Really? Yeah, Grace is friends with lots of people, Tom. Lots of people. She's very friendly. Um, are you hungry? Have you had dinner? I'm not hungry. I don't usually eat this early. We don't either, but my wife had a function at church, lots of leftovers, so I can fix you a plate. I'll get you something. No, I'm really not hungry. Is it me? Sometimes I make people nervous. Oh, no.I like you. You seem to be pretty honest. Yeah, I am. -Well, not that many people are honest. -Yeah. -Yeah. -True. I know. You thought Ricky is here. Oh, no. I know where he is. Is he at Amy's? -And you would know that how? -I was guessing. I told you at school I thought maybe Ricky was capable of taking some  responsibility for what happened. Not that I know him better than you. I'm just an optimistic person. Just being optimistic, hoping for the best. And in this situation, what do you think is the best? Ahem. Why don't you let me take this one, all right? Um, in this situation, I think the very  best possible choice for Amy and Ricky would be to find a loving family to adopt the baby. That way, when the baby grows up, he or she can be thankful to both of them for providing a loving family that has two adults that can actually take care of him or her. Yeah. That's good. Tell you what - Tom, why don't we give the girls a little private time to talk? What do you say? Good night. Really nice to meet you. You too. I don't wanna talk about this anymore. I don't wanna talk about Ricky or the baby. I thought I did, but I don't. I don't know, I didn't want him to be my only option tonight. I should go. No, please, stay. When you drop by, you're supposed to stay a while. There are rules? No, but hang out. We'll talk about something else. Anything else. Like? Like... I don't know. I don't have any girlfriends that I do this with, either, so... I'm not really any better at this than you. So what's new in your life? Oh, I got a new desk. A desk? That's great. I'd love to come see it sometime. OK. Where did you get it, online? I got a great desk online one time. Uh, no.Actually, it was a gift from my mother's boyfriend. Yeah. How'd you get home from school? Taxi. You don't have that kind of cash. I took the bus. You don't even know where the bus is. I walked. All the way home from school? Do people at school know? Know what? About your sister? The whole world knows. How do they know? How does everyone know? Well, the people at school have brothers and sisters who go to school with Amy. Welcome home, Dad. Hello, princess. I saw we had company, so I came around the side. Whose car is that? Can he stay? Why don't you let your father and I talk? Can't the three of us talk? It is about the three of us, especially if Amy's going off to Mimsy's. OK. Why don't we start with how  you got home from school today? Right. I guess you have, um, more important things to talk about than me. She hitched a ride with the bagboy from the grocery store. The college kid? He saw her walking home and picked her up. The cashier we like told me when I  stopped in the market on the way home. She skipped school, George. You know, maybe it  really is time I come home. Or not. We got one daughter who's pregnant and another one who's skipping school. Your point being? Point being is you need me around here Correct me if I'm wrong, but weren't you living here when Amy got pregnant? And I'm pretty sure you were here this  morning when Ashley skipped school. Come on. I know we have problems, but we're not gonna fix our marriage with me outta the house. It took me a few weeks to realize it,  but, hey, at least I realized it. I'm not so sure I wanna fix our marriage. Did you tell Mimsy you and I are living apart? Does your mother know? She doesn't need to know that. I can't imagine she'd be too happy about it. She likes me... better than you, even. Yeah, she likes everyone better than me. So... Amy? She can stay there. I got a referral for a doctor, and I met her, she seems very nice. She's getting Amy into a group with other teen mothers. I don't want my daughter associating with girls like that. Come on, I wanna come home. Where are you staying now? You know, here and there. I checked our credit-card account,  and there aren't any hotel bills on there. You're not staying at the store, are you? Well, I'm... Yeah, I didn't think so. So why don't you slither on back down the driveway, back to wherever it is that you are staying? Where's Amy? She's talking to Ricky. -I told him to leave her alone. -I told her to talk to him. We'll see who's right about this. Call me when you need my help, 'cause you're gonna need my help. -Good night, George. -Good night, Anne. This is my house, too,you know. Yeah, I know. I'm not saying I'm against adoption. I'm saying I'd like to know who's adopting, where they live, and if I can see my own kid. I really don't see why you  should have any say in this. You and your dad would like to ignore I even exist. You know what? I don't know what my father said to you, but I am perfectly capable of speaking for myself! Since when? Since I got pregnant! That's when. Since I discovered I'm going to have to take charge of another human being's life. I might as well start with my own. OK, OK. But I'd like to know where you are and what's going on, if you don't mind. Maybe I do mind. I'll think about what you said, and I'll call you. When? When are you gonna call me? When I feel like it. OK, I'll take that. Thanks. You're welcome. Now go home. Do you wanna exchange phone numbers? No. I'm pretty sure I can find your number  if and when I want to call you. Good night. Good night. What? I was hiding in the bushes. I hope you don't mind. I was coming up the walk, and I saw your dad pull up, and I knew Ricky was inside, so... I got stuck. I don't mind. I don't mind at all. No, no, no. Stay. That bump - that's not me. It's the baby. Yeah, I thought so. The baby. Don't shut me out, Amy. Please don't shut me out. welcome to www.1000fr.com  www.tvsubtitles.net
