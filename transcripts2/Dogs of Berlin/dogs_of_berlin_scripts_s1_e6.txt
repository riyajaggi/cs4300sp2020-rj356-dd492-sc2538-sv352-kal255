Next time it's going to hurt. What did you do to bring these people back into our lives? There won't be a next time. It won't happen again, Paula. I... I will take care of it. Why do I have the feeling that everything you're doing is just making it worse? We never lied to each other, Kurt. We used to be up front and honest. I want us back. -I want us to talk. -And I want that too. Honestly. -But... It's this case... -[loudly] The case! This isn't about the case! Are you involved with those people again? Or are you gambling again? - Tell me, goddamnit! -I want to, man. It's just that you... You are just so damn perfect, Paula. Sometimes I feel like you don't need me at all. That your life would be just as perfect without me. [sniffling] Shit. You are gambling again. Where do you think all the money for your shop comes from? -Hm? -I don't believe it. I'm sorry that I'm not as flawless as you. That I don't have a little shop to sit in. Only selling stuff that no one really needs. -Stop it, Kurt! -I'm trying. Really trying, trying to lead a fucking perfect life. But you know what, Paula? It's just fucking boring. I said stop it! I don't ever want your help with the shop again.

SATURDAY -[dogs bark] -[weights clang] -How's Paula? -What do you think, huh? -I'm lucky if she doesn't leave me. -No way, your wife's hardcore. -How's Mandy? -I think I'm really falling in love. She even wanted a threesome the other day. [Grimmer] Nice. What's his name? -How's the dead Turk? -Still dead. [heavy grunting] Ah... [Ulf] Henkenmaier wants the comrades to start a war. They gave you a message by coming to your house. So you know they mean business. I'm sorry, Kurt. I tried to stop them. Henkenmaier says you have to pay up tomorrow. If you don't, I'm in just as much shit as you are, and you know what that means. Ball-busters. Don't worry, I have the money. More than enough. I just have to make a little TV gig and then I can pick it up. The Brotherhood is meeting at the clubhouse tomorrow. They want you to bring the money and apologize to Henkenmaier and the guys. Do I have to suck his dick too, or what? Easy, Brother, easy. I will be there. With your cash. [phone rings] -What did he say? -I took care of it. -Kurt has the money. -If he has it, why didn't he bring it? He said something about being on TV. -And you believed him? -He's bringing it to the club tomorrow. Your brother is going to get you killed one day. [Thor] I'm hungry. We have nothing to eat. -We'll go out. Mickey D's. -Really? Can I have Chicken McNuggets? Easy, tiger. Go get your brother. Erik! We are going to Mickey D's! -Fuck, what are you doing here? -Picking up the kids. I have them this weekend, remember? Hey, little man! I'm going to show you my new energy efficient housing project. "Energy efficient housing project..." -Buy a calendar, if you're so fucked up... -I've got one. -And every day is "Fuck you, Linus" day. -Get yourself a decent job, Bine. It helps. So I can stand in front of the mirror at night like you? "Ooh! my energy efficient housing project! My charity dinner for kids with cancer! I'm so fucking creative." You should record yourself and listen to it. Then you would understand why the therapist gave up on us. Right! The one whose tits you kept staring at? -Let's go. -Do I get my Chicken McNuggets? Yes, of course. Did you know the whole building is full of robots? [mocks him] Like always, when it gets too tough you chicken out. [moaning] [moans louder] Ah... Ah... [ominous music] KURT, PLEASE, I NEED YOU... I'VE GOT MY TWO BOYS [ominous music] [Henkenmaier] You know the rules. No forbidden symbols in public. I won't go to the pool again. Or I'll cover up with a T-shirt. No one will see it. Johann! Please! Johann! WORK SETS YOU FREE TO EVERYONE HIS DUE [he screams] Ah! -[screaming continues] -Kurt is bringing the money tomorrow. All of it. Trust me. He will come. Better hope so. If your brother lets you down it's going to be ball-busters for you. [screaming continues] [dog barking] Ah! -[Guido] You don't want me to come in? -[Erol] I don't want a scene. I will just have to tell him to stay away from Sevim and Dilara. If it's that easy. Why have we been sitting here for ten minutes? You promised. Wait here for me. [tense music] -Hey, are you okay? -Just drive! [dismal music] [man] Okay, this hard drive of Lukas Schmaus's is Fort Knox. Looks like someone meant business. They used several different cryptography systems, BitLocker, PGP... I thought an EFDD, an Elcomsoft Forensic Disk Decryptor would let me decode the drive's data on the fly, but they built in a few extra security features. Nguyen, BEZ. How's the investigation coming along? I'll try to analyze the internal structure of the encoded hard drive. We recently investigated a number of betting shops belonging to Tomo Kovac. In the process we discovered some irregularities. I just need to know where Schmaus is. Travel plans, vacation homes, that stuff. We've established that Kovac's betting offices more than likely had nothing, absolutely nothing, to do with Orkan Erdem's murder. Those investigations turned out to be a dead end. [music with steady drumbeat starts] [phone rings] [Laubach] You were right about Kurt Grimmer, Trinity. This is a good day for football. [Grimmer] We will have more information for you soon. Please understand that we can't release any more details at this time, as the investigation is still underway. [drumbeats grow louder, faster] Please be patient. [sucks teeth] [drum music crescendos] -Did Bandlow or Seiler approve that? Calm down. Just a little hot air. To get the press off our backs. What were you thinking? Why didn't you tell me what was going on? You wanted to go after Tarik-Amir and Kovac. So, let's go after Tarik-Amir. You and Hans... -Did you find money in Kovac's shop? -What are you talking about? [scoffs] We did, a lot of money. Go and check evidence. Man! -Where are you going? -It's Saturday, right? [tense music] [suspenseful music] [coach] You know what we are going to face? A stadium filled with 50,000. 50,000 people who hate us. 50,000 people screaming at the top of their lungs. But we'll show them what we are made of and that we are the best... [coach's voice tails off] [Kareem] I wouldn't have guessed that bitch was underage. But with all these ripe teens around it's easy to get it wrong, eh? In your next game you get a red card in the first half. [coach] Let's go, guys! Let's go. [coach] Yeah. Where's the support when you really need it, huh? You're not a loser. I know that. All that matters is what our fans think, and they think you are the best. I know you don't give a shit about the business side. The guys in suits, the agents, the sponsors. Just play and forget about all that shit. You are the most talented player I've ever coached. So get out there and win. For us, for all of us. For Leipzig! [drum music] [cheers] [drum music dies down] [whistle] Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa! [indistinct arguing] [player] No, that was nothing! That was nothing, man! [whistle] [unintelligible] -[cheers, whistles] -Hey, 18. You're out. -We have to get going. -You're leaving so soon? There's traffic. -We'll be in touch. -We'll call you. [mother] Thank you. [phone rings] Did you get the evidence list I asked for? I did, and I checked all the movements already. Both Grimmer and Kuscha personally put cash from the raid in the evidence locker. Fuck. You don't trust Grimmer anymore, do you? They are both smart? -You should talk to Fucht. -Talk to you later, Wachtmeister. [suspenseful music] [unintelligible] [Grimmer] Yeah, that's what I mean. Okay. [merry piano music] POLICE ♪ In the past, when July came around ♪ ♪ We would gladly bid farewell To our home city ♪ ♪ But today some poor citizens ♪ ♪ Have a hole in their wallet ♪ [ringing] ♪ Is that a reason to be worried... ♪ Shit. Sorry. [choirmaster] From number 21. "Sorry." ♪ Is that a reason to be worried? ♪ Yeah? Hi, Dilara? How's Mom? I'll be right there. ♪ Why don't you realize? ♪ ♪ The Spree still flows through Berlin ♪ ♪ Müggelsee Lake still close by ♪ ♪ The Grunewald Forest Still blooms around it ♪ [song dies away] Where is he? -Where is he? -He's gone now. It wasn't that bad. You were supposed to meet with him, Erol. Didn't you talk? Problems with the investigation, I got held up. So did you talk to that knife guy's Mom? She wants to go to court, but I made a deal with her lawyer. -There you go! Good news. -I need all the money from the raids. -All of it? -To make all this go away. Okay, that's fine by me. Sure? I know you are in trouble too. But I'm really running out of time, without the money I'll end up behind bars. -Can you pay him back a little bit... -Just give me some time. I'll sort this out and I will get back to you. You still have the money, right? Sure. [Hakim] So why am I here? Hm? [Kareem] You think I put out the hit on Orkan. You don't trust me, Hakim. You don't listen to my advice because you're scared I'll betray you. I'm scared of nothing. But I alone decide how we do business. I know. And it was wrong of me to plan the deal with Kovac. I know that now. That's why I need your help. I think what's happening here, us fighting, that's exactly what Orkan's killer wants us to do. That we mistrust each other, that we don't talk to each other, instead of fighting the real enemy together. Tomo Kovac. [Kareem] He wasn't happy that we were able to fix the game. He was pissed. He never wanted to make a deal. He was just playing us against each other. [Tomo, in Croatian] So, boys. [in English] The last few days have proven that the Tarik-Amirs cheated us. Drugs aren't enough. Now they're trying to push us out of the gambling business. And he wiped out our biggest source of betting income. My connection to Orkan. [in Croatian] Those assholes killed Orkan. [in English] And they sent the cops after us. Kovac has been playing both sides, playing us the whole time. No, he's playing you. Yeah. With me. We'll show them that boys have no business sitting at a man's table. -[in Croatian] Right? -[in Croatian] That's right? Let's go. Let's go. [Hakim] Come here. We'll take down Tomo Kovac. [whispering] And we'll take his business.

Morning. Do you have EUCAP access? I want to look at Erdem's Lamborghini again. Mm-hm. Want to get dinner later? I don't know. If I have time. Sure, why not? You think that's why you're here? Okay. You had your kiss. That's it. You're not here because of your looks. You're here because you're smart. And you couldn't just tell me that? Maybe I was a little dumb there, but you were a total idiot. Total idiot. [door slams] [oppressive music] [Blond guy] Hey! [laughing] [dramatic music] Hey, Paula? Drinking again, huh? Piss off! Piss the fuck off! You, too. Fuck off! Are you okay? Get lost, there's nothing to see here. Piss off! [dismal music] [rings the doorbell] [ominous music] Ah... [oppressive music] [key turns in lock] [Emilia] Leave me alone! You are stupid. [giggling] -What are you doing? -Did you hear that? Yeah, it's your stinky fart. It smells like doo-doo. -Hey! -Ow! -I'll get you back for that. -I'll get you back more. [babysitter] Stop arguing or I won't read to you. Come on. You've got the right idea, but this is where you go wrong. This is bullshit, man! [Dilara] Slow down. Take your time and go over it again. I will bring some snacks. And bring a gun, so I can shoot myself. [Dilara] Murad! [door shuts] -Do you think he checked it out? -Who? Fuck you. You know who. Murad, the test is in two hours. Why don't you try focusing until then? -You were a lot cooler, before... -Before what? -Before you tried to fuck my sister. -Man, what's up with you? Don't ever talk that way about your own sister. That's how you talk about bitches on the street, man, about hookers selling their pussies, but never about our won women. Do you hear yourself? You just proved my point. Ugh... That's more like it. [threatening music] -[machine gun fire] -[screams] Are you crazy? He has his test and you're getting high? Mann, chill. Murad knows what he'd doing. Stop worrying so much. He needs to be relaxed. Anyway, I have to go to work. Raif! I'm... I'm not just his sister, you know? I'm his mom and his dad too. I used to be more chill. I... You should have seen me. [distant blare of sirens] [dismal music] [man] It was a black van, with four men. [Grimmer snivels] This is why I became a cop. To stop sick shit like this. Who did this? Who did this! Look! Look at her. She had nothing to do with your fucking war. Everyone knows who did this. Everyone! -Only one family would send a hit squad. -Tarik-Amir. -Hit squad from Kaiserwarte? -Pičkas! No cops. We deal with this. [dismal music] [Hakim] Did you find out where Murad is? I heard his sister took him on a business trip. Tell me when he's back. We have to talk. Tamam? Jalla. Drop me off here. [rap music on the radio] Lak, you all right? -Yeah, man, good. You? -Good? -How was it? -Man, if I knew how it was... then I'd have gone out with Hafti. -Right. It is what it is, man. -Mm-hm. [Raif] Come on, let's get that deal. [no dialogue] [portentous music] [Grimmer] So, Tarik-Amir sent his crew over from Kaiserwarte to Tomo Kovac's gambling joint on Blisse Street. They struck in broad daylight. Three Kovac clan members got killed. [Grimmer] Tomo Kovac got away, but a little girl lost her life during the shootout. Tarik-Amir obviously didn't give a shit... [becomes unintelligible] [distorted music] Huh! What a Saturday night, huh? Fuck it. Let's go dancing. Good work today. Really.

But we only sign people from the street, you know? Have you ever tried Massive Turner or Four Music? Gone to major labels and all that? -I do gangster rap. -But you're no gangster.
