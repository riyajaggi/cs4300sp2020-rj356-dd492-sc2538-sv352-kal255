 Moran: THERE ARE VERY FEW PLACES IN THE WORLD THAT COULD ACTUALLY KICK-START WORLD WAR III. BUT THIS IS ONE OF THEM. Narrator: AND STRANGE MARKINGS IN THE AMAZON WILDERNESS HINT AT THE EXISTENCE OF AN ANCIENT, PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN CIVILIZATION. THIS COULD BE ONE OF THE BIGGEST GAME CHANGERS IN SOUTH AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY THAT HAS EVER BEEN. Narrator: BAFFLING PHENOMENA, MYSTERIES FROM SPACE, WHAT ON EARTH ARE THEY? A SATELLITE MAPPING IMAGE OF A REMOTE EXPANSE OF THE PACIFIC OCEAN SHOWS SOMETHING STRANGE.

 THE JAPANESE-OWNED ISLAND OF MINAMI-TORI-SHIMA HAS COMPLETELY DISAPPEARED. Kourounis: IF YOU LOOK AT SATELLITE IMAGES FROM 2003, YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE A TRIANGULAR-SHAPED ISLAND. BUT FAST-FORWARD TO 2015. AND THAT SAME AREA, THE ISLAND IS GONE. Narrator: IN ITS PLACE IS SIMPLY A PATCH OF DARK SEA. WHAT COULD HAVE THAT KIND OF EFFECT ON THE LANDSCAPE? Narrator: MINAMI-TORI-SHIMA IS APPROXIMATELY 1,000 MILES SOUTHEAST OF JAPAN. RECORDS OF ITS EXISTENCE GO BACK CENTURIES TO THE SPANISH EXPLORERS WHO FIRST DISCOVERED IT. THE DARKENING OF THE SEA IN THE AREA SUGGESTS THAT SOMETHING CATASTROPHIC HAS HAPPENED HERE. THE DISAPPEARANCE OF AN ENTIRE ISLAND CAN SOMETIMES BE THE RESULT OF A CATACLYSMIC VOLCANIC EVENT. THE DISAPPEARANCE OF AN ISLAND IS A DRAMATIC CHANGE. AND SOMETHING QUITE BIG WOULD HAVE TO CAUSE IT. THE ISLAND OF KRAKATOA DISAPPEARED IN A MASSIVE VOLCANIC ERUPTION. Narrator: THE ISLAND KNOWN AS KRAKATOA WAS ACTUALLY THE CONE OF A LARGE VOLCANO. IN 1883, IT ERUPTED SO VIOLENTLY, 6 CUBIC MILES OF ROCK AND ASH SHOT INTO THE AIR, TURNING DAY INTO NIGHT ACROSS THE JAVA SEA AND THE INDIAN OCEAN. BUT SEISMIC DATA FROM 2015 SHOWS NO SIGN OF ANY SUCH ERUPTION HAPPENING ANYWHERE IN THE AREA. IN THE ABSENCE OF A NATURAL EXPLANATION FOR THE ISLAND'S DISAPPEARANCE, EXPERTS CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY IT MIGHT'VE BEEN DELIBERATELY DESTROYED. THE ISLAND OF NOATU IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY REMOVED OR DESTROYED BY THE MINING OF THE FERTILIZER GUANO. THAT MIGHT BE WHAT HAPPENED HERE. THERE'S A PHENOMENON KNOWN AS MOUNTAINTOP REMOVAL MINING. THEY REMOVE THE TOP OF A MOUNTAIN TO GET AT THE MINERALS THAT ARE INSIDE. WHY NOT DO THAT WITH AN ISLAND? Narrator: BUT WHAT COULD BE SO VALUABLE IT'S WORTH WIPING AN ENTIRE ISLAND OFF THE MAP? ASTONISHINGLY, IN 2012, GEOLOGISTS DISCOVERED MINAMI-TORI-SHIMA WAS HOME TO INCREDIBLE RICHES. SAMPLES OF DIRT TAKEN FROM AROUND THE ISLAND WERE FOUND TO CONTAIN PRECIOUS RARE EARTH ELEMENTS USED IN THE MANUFACTURE OF COMPUTER CHIPS AND OTHER HIGH-TECH GOODS. FOR OVER A DECADE, CHINA HAD A STRANGLEHOLD ON THESE VALUABLE, HIGH-TECH RAW MATERIALS, SUPPLYING OVER 95% OF THE WORLD'S DEMANDS, BUT NOT ANYMORE. FINDING RARE EARTH ELEMENTS IN THESE QUANTITIES IS A POTENTIAL GAME CHANGER FOR JAPAN. Marshall: JAPAN IS A MASSIVE CONSUMER OF RARE EARTH METALS. AND SO TO FIND THEIR OWN AND NO LONGER HAVE TO BE BEHOLDEN TO THE CHINESE FOR RARE EARTH METALS IS, FOR THEM, A GODSEND. Narrator: THE SEAM THEY'VE DISCOVERED IN THE AREA IS MASSIVE. THERE ARE ENOUGH TO KEEP JAPAN IN RARE EARTH METALS FOR THE NEXT TWO CENTURIES. Narrator: BUT GEOLOGICAL RECORDS REVEAL A FLAW IN THE MINING THEORY. THE RARE EARTH METALS ARE NOT ACTUALLY ON THE ISLAND OF MINAMI-TORI-SHIMA. THEY'RE BURIED ABOUT 20,000 FEET BELOW THE SURFACE OF THE SURROUNDING OCEAN. THESE RARE EARTH MINERALS ARE REALLY THE SEABED AROUND THE ISLAND. SO IF YOU WERE AFTER THEM, YOU WOULDN'T DIG THE ISLAND ITSELF AWAY. Narrator: ANY MINERS WANTING TO EXPLOIT THE MINERALS AROUND MINAMI-TORI-SHIMA WOULD NEED THE ISLAND AS A BASE. MINING CANNOT EXPLAIN ITS DISAPPEARANCE. SEVERAL OTHER ISLANDS IN THE PACIFIC HAVE VANISHED BENEATH THE WAVES BECAUSE OF RISING SEA LEVELS. COULD THE EXPLANATION BE THAT SIMPLE? THERE ARE A FEW PLACES ON EARTH THAT ARE VERY VULNERABLE TO SEA LEVEL RISE. THE ISLANDS OF THE MALDIVES, KIRABASH, TUVALU. PEOPLE OF THESE COUNTRIES ARE ACTUALLY STARTING TO THINK ABOUT WHERE TO RELOCATE THEIR NATION TO, BECAUSE IN A HUNDRED YEARS OR SO, THEY MAY NO LONGER EXIST. Narrator: IMAGE ANALYSIS OF THE ISLAND'S TOPOGRAPHY SUGGESTS IT COULD BE VULNERABLE. Fletcher: THE MIDDLE OF THE ISLAND IS ACTUALLY 3 FEET BELOW SEA LEVEL SURROUNDED BY A RIM OF HIGHER GROUND. SO IF THAT RIM WERE SOMEHOW BREACHED, THEN IT COULD BE BYE, BYE FOR THE ISLAND. Narrator: THE THEORY SOUNDS PLAUSIBLE EXCEPT FOR ONE MYSTERIOUS ANOMALY. Moran: THE WEIRD THING IS, THERE'S A WEATHER STATION ON THE ISLAND. AND IT'S STILL TRANSMITTING DATA. IT WOULDN'T BE DOING THAT IF THE ISLAND WERE UNDERWATER. Fletcher: SO THE ISLAND STILL HAS TO BE THERE. WE JUST CAN'T SEE IT. Narrator: PERHAPS MINAMI-TORI-SHIMA ITSELF HAS NOT VANISHED, JUST PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE OF IT. SOME BELIEVE A SHADOWY GOVERNMENT AGENCY HAS DECIDED THAT IT SHOULD NO LONGER EXIST ON SATELLITE IMAGES. SOMEBODY HAS DELIBERATELY WIPED THIS LOCATION OFF THE MAP. WHY WOULD ANYBODY DO THAT? WHY WOULD ANYBODY TAKE SOMETHING OFF A MAP? WELL, THE REASON IS POLITICAL OR IT'S MILITARY. Hansen: SATELLITE IMAGERY IS BEING DEGRADED BY DIGITAL MEANS AS WE SPEAK. Narrator: EVEN TODAY, BUILDINGS IN SECURITY-SENSITIVE LOCATIONS ARE PIXELATED ON DIGITAL MAP SITES. IT'S DONE SO THAT WE DON'T GIVE AWAY THEIR SECRETS. Narrator: IT'S POSSIBLE THE ORIGINAL, UNALTERED IMAGE OF MINAMI-TORI-SHIMA REVEALED SOME SECRET ACTIVITY CONNECTED TO THE ISLAND'S VAST HIDDEN WEALTH. WHATEVER THEY WERE DOING THE DAY IT WAS OBSCURED IS RELATED TO MILITARY AND RARE EARTH METALS. IT IS SO SENSITIVE THAT IT REQUIRES COVERING UP. THE JAPANESE SPECIAL FORCES ARE THERE NOW. IT IS NOW IMPERATIVE TO GUARD THAT ISLAND. IT'S WORTH A FORTUNE. Narrator: THE INTERVENTION OF SPECIAL FORCES LENDS WEIGHT TO THE IDEA THE IMAGE WAS DELIBERATELY ALTERED TO CONCEAL CLANDESTINE OPERATIONS. TO DATE, THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT ISSUED ANY STATEMENT REGARDING ITS ACTIVITIES ON THE ISLAND. DEEP IN THE AMAZON RAINFOREST, HUNDREDS OF UNNATURAL PATTERNS ARE EMERGING FROM THE UNDERGROWTH. THIS IS PRETTY INCREDIBLE. Narrator: COULD THESE ENORMOUS EARTHWORKS BE SIGNS OF A CITY TIME FORGOT? Kourounis: THIS COULD BE ONE OF THE LARGEST ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCOVERIES IN SOUTH AMERICAN HISTORY. Narrator: JUNE 19, 2006. SATELLITES SCANNING SOUTH AMERICA'S VAST AMAZON RAINFOREST CAPTURE IMAGES OF UNNATURALLY STRAIGHT LINES AND REGULAR SHAPES ON GROUND RECENTLY EXPOSED BY LOGGING. FURTHER IMAGES REVEAL THERE ARE MORE THAN 400 OF THESE EXTRAORDINARY GEOMETRIC PATTERNS SPREAD OVER AN AREA OF 59,000 SQUARE MILES. IT'S ODD THAT YOU WOULD HAVE SO MANY OF THESE SHAPES SORT OF CLUSTERED IN THIS ONE PART OF THE JUNGLE. WHY ARE THEY THERE? WE DON'T KNOW WHO MADE THESE THINGS OR WHEN THEY WERE MADE, UH, EVEN LESS ABOUT WHAT THEY REPRESENT. Narrator: THIS AREA, CLOSE TO THE BOLIVIAN BORDER, WAS ONCE A VAST TRACT OF UNTOUCHED JUNGLE THAT MANY CONSIDER WAS TOO INHOSPITABLE TO HAVE SUPPORTED A MAJOR HUMAN SETTLEMENT. THE ASSUMPTION IS THAT THE REGION WAS UNINHABITED FOR MOST OF HISTORY. THIS IS A REALLY LARGE AREA, A VAST EXTENSION OF RAINFOREST. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT, YOU KNOW, MILES OF WILDERNESS. Narrator: RECENT SATELLITE IMAGES MAKE IT CLEAR SOMEONE HAS BEEN HERE BEFORE. WHOEVER CREATED THESE SHAPES MUST'VE DONE IT HUNDREDS, PERHAPS THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO. WHY THEY DID SO IS UNCLEAR. OTHER ANCIENT JUNGLE CULTURES COULD OFFER CLUES. IT'S NOT UNCOMMON IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE WORLD TO SEE AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES MAKE INTERESTING SHAPES. THINK OF RICE PADDIES IN SOUTHEAST ASIA. YOU HAVE THESE WONDERFUL TERRACED STRUCTURES. COULD THIS ACTUALLY BE SOMETHING SIMILAR TO THAT? Narrator: THIS PARTICULAR AREA IS ONE OF THE WETTEST PLACES ON EARTH, WITH OVER 80 INCHES OF RAIN A YEAR. PERHAPS THESE ANCIENT DITCHES WERE DESIGNED TO HELP DRAIN THE WATERLOGGED SOIL. [ LUZ SPEAKING NATIVE LANGUAGE ] BUT THE ELEVATION OF THE LINES CAST DOUBT ON THE IDEA THAT THEY ARE DRAINAGE CHANNELS. MANY OF THESE CIRCULAR SHAPES HAVE BEEN FOUND ON, YOU KNOW, SOMETHING LIKE A 200-METER-HIGH PLATEAU. Narrator: IF THAT'S THE CASE, THERE WOULD BE NO NEED TO DRAIN THE LAND. A PEOPLE FROM THE DISTANT PAST EXPENDED HUGE RESOURCES TO CREATE THESE SHAPES. BUT WHO? THE FIRST OF THE GREAT CIVILIZATIONS TO COME ANYWHERE NEAR THIS AREA WAS THE INCA. THE INCAS HAD AN EMPIRE THAT STRETCHED UP AND DOWN THE SPINE OF THE ANDES. AND THE EASTERN QUARTER WAS THE AREA THAT EXTENDED DOWN THE SLOPES OF THE ANDES AND INTO THE AMAZON. IS THERE PERHAPS AN OFFSHOOT OR A SUBGROUP OF THE INCAN PEOPLE THAT DECIDED TO LEAVE THE MOUNTAINS AND TAKE UP SHOP IN THE JUNGLE? IT'S A POSSIBILITY. Narrator: THE INCA ONCE RULED THE LARGEST EMPIRE IN THE NEW WORLD, STRETCHING MORE THAN 2,500 MILES. THEY WERE FEARED FOR GRUESOME SACRIFICE AND MUMMIFICATION. AND THEY REMAIN FAMOUS FOR THEIR SEEMINGLY IMPOSSIBLE FEATS OF ENGINEERING, LIKE THE CONSTRUCTION OF MACHU PICCHU ON A REMOTE MOUNTAINTOP 8,000 FEET ABOVE SEA LEVEL. BUT WHILE THEY HAD THE SKILLS, THE INCA ARE NOT KNOWN TO HAVE CREATED ANYTHING LIKE THE AMAZON GEOGLYPHS. [ SPEAKING NATIVE LANGUAGE ] IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE THESE ARE SUCH LARGE EARTHWORKS THAT YOU WOULD NEED A LARGE POPULATION TO BUILD THEM, NOT JUST A SMALL BREAKAWAY GROUP OF INCAS. Narrator: THE SHEER SCALE OF THE GEOGLYPHS FORCES SCIENTISTS TO CONFRONT AN INCREDIBLE POSSIBILITY -- THE EXISTENCE OF A VAST, PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN CIVILIZATION HIDDEN WITHIN THE AMAZON JUNGLE, A TRUE EL DORADO. IF YOU SEE THE CHRONICLES OF THE VERY FIRST EXPLORERS OF THE AMAZON, THEY DESCRIBED LARGE CITIES WITH LARGE POPULATIONS OCCUPYING THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE AMAZON RIVER. MOST OF THOSE ACCOUNTS WERE LATER DISCREDITED. MAYBE THESE DESCRIPTIONS WERE FAR MORE ACCURATE THAN HAS BEEN THOUGHT. Narrator: EXAMINATION OF CORE SAMPLES FROM THE SOIL IN THE TRENCHES ENABLES ARCHAEOLOGISTS TO PUT A DATE ON THEIR CREATION. BUT FAR FROM SOLVING THE PUZZLE, THE DATE ONLY DEEPENS THE MYSTERY OF THE GEOGLYPHS. THEY ARE 6,000 YEARS OLD. THIS IS PRETTY INCREDIBLE. THEY'RE AS LONG AGO, MAYBE AS FAR BACK AS SIX MILLENNIA, THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO KNEW HOW TO SURVIVE IN THE AMAZON AND PROSPER IN LARGE NUMBERS. Narrator: 14 CENTURIES BEFORE THE EGYPTIAN PYRAMIDS, A PREVIOUSLY UNHEARD OF ANCIENT PEOPLE BUILT AN EMPIRE THE SIZE OF GEORGIA IN THE AMAZON BASIN. HERE WE HAVE EVIDENCE OF A CIVILIZATION THAT GOES BACK SOME 6,000 YEARS. AND IT'S VAST. Narrator: BUT HOW COULD SUCH A CIVILIZATION SUSTAIN ITSELF IN THE AMAZON JUNGLE? FURTHER ANALYSIS OF THE SEDIMENT SAMPLES PRODUCES ANOTHER SHOCKING DISCOVERY -- TRACES OF CORN PRODUCTION. IT MEANS THAT 6,000 YEARS AGO, THIS AREA WASN'T JUNGLE AT ALL. IT WAS FARMLAND. Kourounis: SO THAT SUGGESTS THAT THE CLIMATE WAS VERY DIFFERENT BACK THEN THAN IT IS NOW. AND THAT COULD CHANGE OUR UNDERSTANDING COMPLETELY OF WHAT THE RAINFOREST IS LIKE. Narrator: NO ONE REALLY KNOWS HOW OR WHEN THIS HUGE CIVILIZATION COLLAPSED AND DISAPPEARED. BUT WHILE IT FLOURISHED, IT SEEMS TO HAVE TRANSFORMED THE LANDSCAPE. Van Gijseghem: WHEN THESE PEOPLE DISAPPEARED, THE FORESTS KIND OF RECLAIMED THESE AREAS. AND THE IMAGE THAT WE HAVE OF A PRISTINE LANDSCAPE IS ACTUALLY, PERHAPS, A VERY RECENT ONE. Narrator: THE GEOGLYPH'S MYSTERIOUS CREATORS ARE LONG DEAD, THEIR MOTIVATIONS UNKNOWN. BUT THE MARK THEY LEFT ON THE LANDSCAPE REMAINS VISIBLE FROM SPACE. Kourounis: WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO BUILT THIS. THIS IS A HUGE MYSTERY. THIS COULD BE ONE OF THE BIGGEST GAME CHANGERS IN SOUTH AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY THAT HAS EVER BEEN. Narrator: A SATELLITE SPOTS A SUSPICIOUS SUBMARINE DOCKED IN A NORTH KOREAN SHIPYARD. NORTH KOREA IS A COUNTRY THAT MIGHT HURT US. AND IF YOU FORGET ABOUT THAT, THEY REMIND YOU. Moran: THERE ARE VERY FEW PLACES IN THE WORLD THAT COULD ACTUALLY KICK-START WORLD WAR III. BUT THIS IS ONE OF THEM. Narrator: SINPO SHIPYARD, NORTH KOREA, 2016, A SURVEILLANCE SATELLITE KEEPS A VIGILANT EYE ON THE ROGUE NATION'S MOST FEARED MILITARY COMPLEX. EVERYONE IS WATCHING THE SITE -- U.S., U.K., SOUTH KOREAN, CHINESE, RUSSIAN, JAPANESE. Narrator: LOCATED ON THE EAST COAST OF THE KOREAN PENINSULA, THE SHIPYARD STRATEGICALLY FACES THE REGIME'S MORTAL ENEMIES -- SOUTH KOREA AND JAPAN. French: THE PORT OF SINPO IS OFFICIALLY A PORT FOR FISHING VESSELS. ALTHOUGH, WE'VE KNOWN FOR A LONG TIME THAT IT IS, INDEED, WHERE NORTH KOREA KEEPS ITS SUBMARINE FLEET. Narrator: U.S. SPY SATELLITES MONITOR NORTH KOREA'S FLEET OF 70 SUBMARINES. MOST ARE SMALL, 330-TON SUBMERSIBLES, ONLY DANGEROUS TO OTHER SHIPS. BUT OVER RECENT YEARS, IMAGE ANALYST MELISSA HANHAM HAS OBSERVED SOME DISTURBING DEVELOPMENTS. USING SATELLITE IMAGERY, YOU CAN TRACK CHANGES IN WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE. THERE'S NEW ROOFS GOING ON TO BUILDINGS, MORE DRY DOCKS BEING CONSTRUCTED. IT'S CLEAR THAT KIM JONG-UN IS INVESTING A LOT OF RESOURCES IN HIS SUBMARINE PROGRAM. Narrator: A SATELLITE PHOTOGRAPH TAKEN IN JANUARY 2016 SHOWS SOMETHING IN THE HARBOR ANALYSTS HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE -- A NEW CLASS OF SUBMARINE. THE QUESTION IS, WHAT IS THIS CAPABLE OF? Hanham: WHEN WE GET AN IMAGE LIKE THIS, WHAT WE START DOING IS TAKING MEASUREMENTS. THEN WE IMMEDIATELY START COMPARING IT TO OTHER SUBMARINES IN THE WORLD. AND THEN FROM THERE, WE CAN BUILD 3-D MODELS. Narrator: THE NEW SUB IS 220 FEET LONG AND LOOKS BIGGER THAN ANYTHING NORTH KOREA HAS PRODUCED BEFORE. HOW MUCH OF A THREAT IT POSES DEPENDS ON THE WEAPONS IT CAN CARRY. IF IT'S BIG ENOUGH TO LAUNCH BALLISTIC MISSILES, THE SUB IS POTENTIALLY A GLOBAL PROBLEM. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING RIGHT NOW IS LOOKING AT THE -- WHAT WE CALL THE SAIL HEIGHT OF THE SUBMARINE. AND WE CAN SEE A SHADOW THAT IS CAST FROM THE SUBMARINE. AND BECAUSE WE KNOW THE EXACT MOMENT THAT THE IMAGE WAS TAKEN, WE CAN DO JUST A LITTLE BIT OF GEOMETRY. AND WE CAN LEARN THE HEIGHT OF THE SAIL. Narrator: SCALE ANALYSIS REVEALS THE SO-CALLED SAIL IS 20 FEET HIGH, GIVING THIS SUB A LAUNCH TUBE CAPACITY OF AROUND 30 FEET. IT TELLS EXPERTS THAT THE SUB HAS BEEN DESIGNED WITH A CLEAR PURPOSE -- TO LAUNCH THE 30-FOOT-LONG PUKKUKSONG-1 BALLISTIC MISSILE, RECENTLY REVEALED IN THIS RARE FOOTAGE FROM NORTH KOREAN STATE TELEVISION. Moran: WHEN WE SEE A BALLISTIC MISSILE SUBMARINE IN A SHIPYARD IN NORTH KOREA, WE HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION. Narrator: THIS IS THE NIGHTMARE SCENARIO. THEY COULD LAUNCH A MISSILE ANYWHERE THAT THEY CAN SEND THAT SUBMARINE. Narrator: UNTRACEABLE BY SATELLITE, A SUB ON SILENT RUNNING CAN SNEAK WITHIN RANGE OF ANY TARGET COUNTRY. BUT FIRING A ROCKET UNDERWATER IS A MASSIVE TECHNOLOGICAL CHALLENGE BELIEVED TO BE BEYOND NORTH KOREA'S CAPABILITIES... UNTIL NOW. IN AUGUST 2016, NORTH KOREAN STATE TV BROADCAST A SUCCESSFUL TEST LAUNCH OF THE PUKKUKSONG MISSILE. IF YOU WERE WATCHING THAT LAUNCH TEST ON NORTH KOREAN NEWS, IT MIGHT'VE LOOKED LIKE QUITE A SUCCESS. THIS HUGE THING ROARED OUT OF THE SEA. AND THAT -- THAT'S PRETTY HIGH-CALIBER TECHNOLOGY. Narrator: THE MISSILE FLEW 311 MILES ACROSS THE SEA OF JAPAN, DELIBERATELY VIOLATING JAPAN'S AIR DEFENSE ZONE. THIS KIND OF WEAPON COULD WIPE A CITY THE SIZE OF HIROSHIMA, NAGASAKI OR MANHATTAN OFF THE MAP. AND NO ONE WOULD SEE IT COMING. 16 DAYS AFTER THE SUBMARINE LAUNCH, NORTH KOREA DEMONSTRATES ITS AMBITIONS WITH CLAIMS THAT IT HAS DETONATED A PARTICULAR TYPE OF NUCLEAR DEVICE. Hanham: FOR THE FIRST TIME, THEY REVEALED A PURPORTED NUCLEAR WARHEAD. IT'S DESIGNED, CLEARLY, TO FIT INTO MANY, MANY OF THEIR MISSILES. THAT IS AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO THE UNITED STATES AND ANY OTHER ADVERSARY OF NORTH KOREA. WHAT A NUCLEAR CAPACITY AT SEA GIVES NORTH KOREA IS THE ABILITY TO REALLY, REALLY HURT THE UNITED STATES IN A WAY THAT THEY DON'T NORMALLY HAVE. WHEN YOU GO WATCH SOME OF THOSE TESTS THAT THE U.S. DID AFTER THE SECOND WORLD WAR, AND YOU WATCH WHAT A NUCLEAR WEAPON WOULD DO TO A U.S. CARRIER TASK FORCE, AND IT WOULD BE BRUTAL. Driscoll: A NORTH KOREAN SUB ARMED WITH NUCLEAR MISSILES IS A NIGHTMARE. WE CANNOT AFFORD TO TAKE OUR EYES OFF OF THIS PLACE. Narrator: AN ASTRONAUT ABOARD THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION TAKES AN AWE-INSPIRING PHOTOGRAPH. Cerveny: WHAT I'M LOOKING AT IS A FAR DISTANT GALAXY OF THOUSANDS OF STARS. THE SCALE IS MIND-BOGGLING. Narrator: BUT THERE'S A BAFFLING PROBLEM. THE CAMERA ISN'T POINTING OUT INTO DEEP SPACE. IT'S POINTING DOWN TOWARDS EARTH. Narrator: MAY 2015, ITALIAN ASTRONAUT SAMANTHA CRISTOFORETTI UPLOADS A STRANGE PHOTOGRAPH SHE'S TAKEN FROM THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION... ...A STAR-SPANGLED MILKY WAY THAT ISN'T OUT IN SPACE. IT'S ON THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH. SO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT HERE IS AN IMAGE THAT LOOKS LIKE A LONG STRIP OF LOTS OF BRIGHT LIGHTS. YOU THINK TO YOURSELF, "WHERE ON EARTH IS THAT?" WHATEVER THIS PHENOMENA IS, IT'S MASSIVE. Narrator: THE GATHERING OF THE STRANGE LIGHTS HAS PROVOKED WILD SPECULATION OF UNIDENTIFIED CRAFT IN THE SOUTH SEAS. BUT THERE ARE NO REPORTS OF UFO SIGHTINGS IN THE AREA. IMAGE ANALYST MARC D'ANTONIO EXAMINES THE POSSIBILITY THE LIGHTS MIGHT SIMPLY BE A WEATHER-BASED OPTICAL ILLUSION CALLED LIGHT PILLARS. LIGHT PILLARS ARE FORMED BY ICE CRYSTALS IN THE AIR, CATCHING THE LIGHT FROM BELOW AND REFLECTING IT BACK TO YOU. Narrator: FOR LIGHT PILLARS TO FORM, THE ICE CRYSTALS IN THE AIR HAVE TO BE FLAT. THEY ARE FLAT AND HEXAGONAL. AND WHEN THEY FALL TOWARDS THE EARTH, THEY SORT OF FALL LIKE A -- A FEATHER. Narrator: TO SEE A LIGHT PILLAR, AN OBSERVER HAS TO BE AT JUST THE RIGHT ANGLE TO THE ICE CRYSTALS. AT FIRST, YOU MIGHT THINK, "WOW, MAYBE IT'S THESE GUYS SEEN FROM ABOVE. WOULDN'T THEY JUST LOOK LIKE DOTS?" THE ANSWER IS, "NO, THEY WOULDN'T." THIS COLUMN OF LIGHT THAT YOU SEE HERE IS ACTUALLY JUST AN ILLUSION. THESE HEXAGONAL CRYSTALS OF ICE REFLECT THE LIGHT BACK TO YOU. SO WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY SEEING A COLUMN OF LIGHT. WE'RE SEEING A SHAFT OF LIGHT. SO IF IT'S NOT LIGHT PILLARS THAT WE'RE SEEING IN THIS NIGHTTIME IMAGE, WHAT IS CREATING THIS SERIES OF LITTLE LIGHT BEAMS THAT WERE CAPTURED ON THIS PARTICULAR PHOTOGRAPH? Narrator: THERE'S NO NATURAL EXPLANATION FOR THE PATTERN. AND WHEN NASA SATELLITES CAPTURE IMAGES OF THE SAME PHENOMENON, THE LOCATION MAKES IT CLEAR THE LIGHTS CAN'T BE COMING FROM ANY HUMAN SETTLEMENT. THEY'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OCEAN, HUNDREDS OF MILES NORTH OF THE FALKLAND ISLANDS. WE KNOW THAT THERE'S NO CITIES OUT THERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OCEAN. SO WHAT COULD IT BE? Narrator: THE NASA IMAGES ALSO POSE A PUZZLE. Kourounis: IF YOU LOOK AT THE SATELLITE IMAGES OVER A PERIOD OF A FEW DAYS, YOU CAN SEE THAT THE LIGHTS ACTUALLY MOVE AROUND. Narrator: COULD THE LIGHTS BE COMING FROM MYSTERIOUS CRAFT AFTER ALL? WHEN INVESTIGATORS MAP THE COORDINATES ONTO LOCAL CHARTS, THEY REALIZE THE LIGHTS FORM A PATTERN THAT EXACTLY MATCHES THE TERRITORIAL WATERS OF THE FALKLAND ISLANDS. D'Antonio: THIS IS THE SMOKING GUN. THIS SHOWS US THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT A HUMAN OPERATION ON THE OCEAN'S SURFACE. Muller-Karger: THE ONLY THING THAT IT CAN BE ARE SHIPS WITH LIGHTS. THE ONLY THING THAT THEY CAN BE DOING IS FISHING. Narrator: THE BRIGHT LIGHTS ARE PART OF A HIGH-TECH FISHING METHOD THAT GUARANTEES AN ENORMOUS CATCH. AT NIGHT, IF YOU SHINE BRIGHT LIGHTS, CERTAIN SPECIES WILL BE ATTRACTED TO THE SURFACE. THE PLANKTON COMES TO THE SURFACE. THE SMALLER FISH GO AFTER THE PLANKTON. THE LARGER FISH GO AFTER THE SMALLER FISH. THE SQUID GO AFTER THE EVEN LARGER FISH. Narrator: SOUNDS CONVINCING, BUT THERE ARE MANY HUNDREDS OF LIGHTS OUT THERE. AND ONLY 100 LICENSES PER YEAR ARE ISSUED TO FISH THESE WATERS. Kourounis: THERE ARE FAR MORE LIGHTS THAN YOU WOULD IMAGINE FOR THOSE LICENSES. SO WE'VE GOT HUNDREDS, IF NOT THOUSANDS OF UNLICENSED, UNREGULATED FISHERMEN OUT THERE JUST STRIPPING THE OCEAN OF FISH COMPLETELY ILLEGALLY. Narrator: ILLEGAL FISHING IN THIS AREA IS BIG BUSINESS. ONE NIGHT'S CATCH OF SQUID CAN NET UP TO $72,000. THESE PEOPLE COULD BE TAKING 300,000 TONS OF ILLEGAL FISH FROM THE OCEANS EVERY SINGLE YEAR. Narrator: IN MARCH 2016, TWO ILLEGAL FISHING BOATS WERE CAUGHT IN THE AREA. ONE WAS SUNK. WITHOUT CRISTOFORETTI'S PHOTOGRAPH, THE ENORMOUS ILLEGAL ENTERPRISE MIGHT NEVER HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED. IT'S REALLY INCREDIBLE THAT WE CAN'T POLICE A FISHING FLEET ON THE GROUND. BUT FROM 250 MILES UP IN SPACE, WE CAN CATCH THE ILLEGAL ACTIVITY JUST LIKE THAT. Narrator: SOMETHING WEIRD IS HAPPENING IN HONG KONG HARBOR. LOOKING AT THE IMAGE, I'VE GOT NO IDEA WHAT THIS IS. Narrator: FREAK OF NATURE OR ELABORATE HOAX? THIS WAS PROBABLY ONE OF THE, UH, CRAZIEST CASES I'VE EVER HAD TO LOOK AT. Narrator: 2013, HONG KONG, CHINA, A SATELLITE SPOTS AN ODD YELLOW FLOATING OBJECT IN THE HARBOR, TOTALLY OUT OF PLACE WITH ITS SURROUNDINGS. SO WHAT IS THIS THING? IT'S BIG. IT'S YELLOW. IT'S IN THE MIDDLE OF HONG KONG HARBOR, ONE OF THE BUSIEST PORTS IN THE WORLD. Narrator: IT BEARS NO RESEMBLANCE TO ANY OF THE NEIGHBORING BOATS. LOOKING AT THE IMAGE, I'VE GOT NO IDEA WHAT THIS IS. Nelson: THIS IS A PRETTY UNUSUAL, ROUND BLOB IN THE MIDDLE OF HONG KONG HARBOR. WHAT ON EARTH COULD IT BE? Narrator: IF YOU SEE A LARGE, YELLOW OBJECT BOBBING AROUND IN THE OCEAN, THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE IT'S A PIECE OF WEATHER-RECORDING EQUIPMENT. WE HAVE 1,200 WEATHER BUOYS STATIONED ALL AROUND THE WORLD'S OCEANS. IF I WERE TO SUDDENLY SEE SOMETHING IN AN UNUSUAL PLACE THAT'S BIG AND YELLOW, MY FIRST INCLINATION WOULD BE, "YEAH, IT'S PROBABLY A BROKEN-AWAY WEATHER BUOY." Narrator: THESE SPECIALIZED BUOYS GATHER DATA ON OCEAN CURRENTS AND TEMPERATURES TO HELP FORECASTERS PREDICT WEATHER PATTERNS. WE CAN TRACK THEM. SO EVEN IF THEY BREAK FREE, WE CAN FOLLOW WHERE THEY ARE AND BE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHERE THEIR PRECISE LOCATION IS. Narrator: BUT THERE ARE NO RECORDS OF MISSING WEATHER BUOYS IN THE AREA AT THE TIME THE IMAGE WAS TAKEN. THEIR SHEER SIZE MAKES THEM HARD TO LOSE. WEATHER BUOYS ARE ACTUALLY QUITE LARGE. BUT IN THE MIDDLE OF A HARBOR? CAN'T BE THAT, IT HAS TO BE SOMETHING ELSE. Narrator: THE COLOR OF THE MYSTERIOUS OBJECT INSPIRES AN ALTERNATIVE THEORY. ANYBODY WHO GREW UP LISTENING TO BEATLES SONGS IS TOTALLY FAMILIAR WITH THE YELLOW SUBMARINE. SO THAT'S KIND OF ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT POPPED INTO MY MIND, IS MAYBE THAT IT'S A SUBMARINE. Narrator: YELLOW SUBMARINES DO EXIST OUTSIDE OF CARTOONS. IN FACT, IT'S ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR COLORS FOR PRIVATELY OWNED SUBS. YELLOW'S A REALLY GOOD COLOR FOR A SUBMARINE BECAUSE YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO SEE THE SUBMARINE IF IT'S FLOATING AROUND, WAITING TO BE PICKED UP BY A SHIP. Narrator: BY STRANGE COINCIDENCE, A YELLOW SUBMARINE HAS BEEN SPOTTED IN THE AREA. Dr. Capps: PAUL ALLEN, COFOUNDER OF MICROSOFT, HE'S GOT THIS $200 MILLION YACHT AND A YELLOW SUBMARINE HE GOES DIVING, LOOKING FOR SHIPWRECKS. SO POTENTIALLY, HE DOCKED THAT SUBMARINE RIGHT THERE. Narrator: THE SEAS AROUND THE AREA WHERE THE IMAGE WAS TAKEN ARE RICH HUNTING GROUNDS FOR WRECK FINDERS LIKE PAUL ALLEN AND THE CREW OF HIS SUB, THE PAGOO. THERE ARE MORE THAN 500 WORLD WAR II SHIPS SUNK IN THE NEIGHBORING SOUTH CHINA SEA. THE PAGOO IS A LEGITIMATE WRECK FINDER. IT'S OPERATING IN THE PACIFIC, WHICH IS EXACTLY WHERE HONG KONG HARBOR IS. Narrator: ALLEN'S YELLOW SUBMARINE HAS LOCATED SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT WRECKS IN NAVAL HISTORY, INCLUDING THE MUSASHI, A MASSIVE WORLD WAR II JAPANESE BATTLESHIP THAT CARRIED THE BIGGEST GUNS EVER MADE FOR A WARSHIP. THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH THIS THEORY OF THE YELLOW SUBMARINE IS SIMPLY THAT THE TIME LINES DON'T MATCH UP. YOU SEE, PAUL ALLEN'S SUBMARINE WAS EXPLORING THE AREA IN 2015. AND THIS PICTURE WAS TAKEN 2 YEARS BEFORE THAT, IN 2013. SO IT HAS TO BE SOMETHING ELSE. Narrator: DIGITAL ENHANCEMENT OF THE IMAGE REVEALS THE MYSTERY OBJECT LOOKS SURPRISINGLY FAMILIAR. WHEN I THINK YELLOW, FLOATS, I HAVE LITTLE KIDS. IT'S A RUBBER DUCKIE, RIGHT? Narrator: WHAT WOULD A RUBBER DUCK BE DOING IN HONG KONG HARBOR? AN ACCIDENT MANY YEARS AGO COULD OFFER AN ANSWER. JANUARY 10, 1992, UH, A CONTAINER SHIP TRAVELING FROM HONG KONG TO TACOMA, WASHINGTON, LOSES 12 CONTAINERS OVERBOARD. ONE OF THEM SETS LOOSE THOUSANDS OF TINY YELLOW PLASTIC DUCKS ON THE CURRENTS OF THE NORTH PACIFIC. Narrator: THE CURRENTS CARRY THE DUCKS ALL OVER THE WORLD. SO MONTHS LATER, THEY START WASHING UP ON THE COAST OF ALASKA, TURNING THIS TOY SPILL INTO AN ACCIDENTAL EXPERIMENT. SO FROM THE DUCKIE STUDY, YOU GET REAL-TIME DATA ABOUT THE CURRENTS IN THE NORTH PACIFIC. Narrator: THE ACCIDENTAL DUCK EXPERIMENT IS STILL PROVIDING INFORMATION TODAY. THEY'RE ALMOST INDESTRUCTIBLE. I MEAN, LITERALLY 20 YEARS AFTER THEY HIT THE OCEAN, THEY'RE STILL WASHING UP ON BEACHES AROUND THE WORLD. [ DUCK QUACKS ] Narrator: AFTER TWO DECADES OF SLOWLY CIRCULATING THE PACIFIC, ONE OF THE DUCKS COULD'VE WASHED UP IN HONG KONG. BUT THERE'S AN ELEPHANT IN THIS PARTICULAR HARBOR. AS AN ANALYST, ONE OF THE THINGS WE LIKE TO DO IS TRY TO FIGURE OUT THE DIMENSIONS OF THIS OBJECT. NOW THE THING IS, WE LOOK AT THIS DUCK. AND IT TURNS OUT, THIS SHIP RIGHT HERE IS JUST OVER 50 FEET WIDE. SO THIS DUCK APPEARS TO BE ABOUT 50 FEET WIDE. Narrator: A GIANT, 50-FOOT-WIDE RUBBER DUCKIE IN HONG KONG HARBOR? SURELY, THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE. IT HAS TO BE A FAKE. Dr. Capps: THE INTERNET IS COVERED WITH IMAGE HOAXES. YOU THINK OF THE HELICOPTER BEING ATTACKED BY A SHARK. PHOTOSHOP AND IMAGERY GO REALLY WELL ON THE INTERNET AND CREATE A LOT OF EXCITEMENT. HERE'S A GREAT EXAMPLE OF A FAKE. THIS FAKE IS AFFECTIONATELY KNOWN AS CRABZILLA AND WAS CREATED BY QUINTON WINTER, A BRITISH ARTIST. AND HE PUT THIS CRAB INTO THE IMAGE. IF YOU MAKE SURE THAT YOU COVER IT WITH A GREENISH HUE OF ANOTHER LAYER, IT PUTS DISTANCE BETWEEN THAT CRAB AND THE SURFACE OF THE WATER, MAKING IT LOOK LIKE IT'S SUBMERGED. Narrator: BUT THE IMAGE CONTAINING THIS MYSTERIOUS YELLOW OBJECT DOESN'T COME FROM ANY TABLOID SOURCE. IT COMES DIRECT FROM ONE OF THE WORLD'S PREMIER PROVIDERS OF SATELLITE IMAGERY -- DIGITAL GLOBE. Dr. Capps: WHICH IS A VERY WELL-RESPECTED SATELLITE AGENCY. THEY PROVIDE IMAGES TO MILITARY, LAW ENFORCEMENT. THEY DIDN'T SEND OUT A HOAX SHOT. Narrator: THIS UNIDENTIFIED WEIRD ENTITY IS REAL AND MUST HAVE HAD PERMISSION TO BE IN THE HARBOR. AND THAT CAN ONLY MEAN ONE THING. IT IS A GIANT RUBBER DUCK, BIG ENOUGH TO BE SEEN FROM SPACE. Narrator: HONG KONG'S FLOATING DUCK IS A GIANT ART INSTALLATION BY DUTCH ARTIST FLORENTIJN HOFMAN. SINCE 2007, THE DUCKS HAVE BEEN SHOWN ALL AROUND THE WORLD. WHEN ONE CAME TO HONG KONG, MORE THAN 8 MILLION PEOPLE WENT TO SEE IT. THIS WAS PROBABLY ONE OF THE, UH, CRAZIEST CASES I'VE EVER HAD TO LOOK AT. BUT IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST FUN. WE'RE GONNA NEED A BIGGER BATH. Narrator: A MYSTERY AS OLD AS AMERICA ITSELF. WHEN YOU FIRST LOOK DOWN AND YOU SEE THE BAHAMA BANKS FROM SPACE, YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF, "WHAT IS THAT?" Narrator: THESE WEIRD, OTHERWORLDLY SHAPES ARE NOT LAND IN ANY ORDINARY SENSE OF THE WORD. THEY LOOK LIKE A MANIFESTATION OF A SEAFARER'S LEGEND. IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE LAND AT ALL. IT'S THIS COLLECTION OF DARK MARKS AND SHAPES. IT'S VERY STRANGE. Narrator: THE BAHAMAS LIE ABOUT 150 MILES SOUTHEAST OF THE FLORIDA COAST. AT SEA LEVEL, THESE ISLANDS LOOK LIKE A PICTURE-PERFECT TROPICAL PARADISE. Stott: IT SUCKS YOU IN. IT'S HYPNOTIC. IT'S THE TURQUOISE AND THE WHITE AND THE BLUES. IT'S JUST SPECTACULAR. Narrator: BUT WHEN YOU VIEW THESE ISLANDS FROM SPACE, IT BECOMES CLEAR THERE'S SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT. THEY LOOK LIKE THEY COME FROM ANOTHER WORLD. WHEN YOU FIRST LOOK DOWN AND YOU SEE THE BAHAMA BANKS FROM SPACE, YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF, "WHAT IS THAT?" IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE LAND AT ALL. Narrator: TO THE SOUTH, THE ISLANDS OF THE CARIBBEAN RISE ABOVE THE WAVES LIKE MOUNTAIN PEAKS. THE CONTRAST TO THE LOW-LYING BAHAMAS IS STRIKING AND POSES A MYSTERY. Stott: THEY DON'T HAVE THAT SAME ISLAND LOOK TO THEM. THERE'S SOMETHING UNIQUE AND -- AND JUST DIFFERENT ABOUT THE WAY THEY LOOK FROM SPACE. Porges: IT'S THIS COLLECTION OF DARK MARKS AND SHAPES. IT'S VERY STRANGE. Narrator: THERE'S NO GEOLOGICAL EXPLANATION FOR THE FORMATION OF THE BAHAMAS. THEY SHOULDN'T EXIST. SO HOW WERE THESE ISLANDS CREATED? MOST ISLANDS IN THE CARIBBEAN ARE FORMED BY VOLCANOES SPEWING OUT SEARING MAGMA, WHICH COOLS TO FORM NEW LAND. Oehlert: LOT OF THE ISLANDS IN THE CARIBBEAN ARE MADE FROM VOLCANIC PROCESSES BECAUSE THEY'RE SITUATED ALONG AN ACTIVE TECTONIC MARGIN. Dr. Brand: THE REASON THERE ARE VOLCANIC ISLANDS IN THE CARIBBEAN IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE ONE PLATE THAT SUBDUCTS UNDERNEATH THE OTHER. Narrator: BUT THE BAHAMAS ARE NOT VOLCANIC. THEY LIE NORTH OF THE ACTIVE PLATE ZONE. SOMETHING ELSE IS CREATING THE SWIRLING SHAPES WE SEE FROM SPACE. THEIR BIZARRE OUTLINES HAVE EVEN PROVOKED SPECULATION THE ISLANDS MIGHT NOT BE A NATURAL PHENOMENON. Muller-Karger: MAN-MADE ISLANDS ARE NOT A FAR-FETCHED IDEA AT ALL. UH, WE CONSTRUCT AND TRY TO GAIN TERRITORY FROM THE OCEAN ALL THE TIME. Narrator: BUT THE BAHAMAS WERE ALREADY THERE WHEN CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS RECORDED THEIR EXISTENCE IN 1492. SO SURELY, THEY CAN'T BE MAN-MADE. ACTUALLY, THE TECHNOLOGY FOR BUILDING NEW LANDMASSES HAS EXISTED FOR MUCH LONGER THAN PEOPLE REALIZE. THE QING DYNASTY IN CHINA DID IT SEVERAL HUNDRED YEARS AGO. AND EVEN BEFORE THAT, IN MESOAMERICA, THERE WERE EFFORTS TO DO RECLAMATION OF LANDS IN CENTRAL AMERICA. Narrator: OVER 600 YEARS AGO, THE AZTECS IN NEARBY MEXICO WERE RECLAIMING VAST LAKES TO GROW CROPS BY BUILDING MASSIVE PLATFORMS IN THE WATER. NOT EVEN MODERN ISLAND BUILDERS HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY TO BUILD SOMETHING AS BIG AS THE BAHAMAS. Muller-Karger: THE BAHAMAS IS HUGE. THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THAT IN THE HISTORY OF HUMANITY HAVE WE HAD THE CAPABILITY TO DO ENGINEERING AT THESE SCALE. Narrator: BUT THE BAHAMAS ARE HOME TO OTHER LIVING CREATURES THAT ARE CAPABLE OF LAND CONSTRUCTION ON THIS SCALE. THESE ARE STROMATOLITES, A WEIRD, VERY RARE KIND OF LIVING ROCK. THEY'RE CONSTANTLY GROWING AS TINY ORGANISMS WITHIN THEM PROCESS MINERALS IN THE WATER. THESE ARE BIG ROCK STRUCTURES BUILT BY LITTLE, TINY MICROBES. Narrator: A TYPE OF CYANOBACTERIA CREATES THE PERFECT CONDITIONS FOR CALCIUM CARBONATE, OR LIMESTONE, TO PRECIPITATE OUT OF THE WATER. AT A RATE OF LESS THAN A 50th OF AN INCH A YEAR, LAYERS OF NEW ROCK FORM. IT'S AGONIZINGLY SLOW. BUT OVER MILLIONS OF YEARS, THE PROCESS CAN FORM NEW LAND. THESE STRUCTURES ARE ACTIVELY GROWING NOW. THEY'RE REEFS BUILT BY CYANOBACTERIA. AND EVENTUALLY, THOSE PLATFORMS MAKE REEFS THAT CAN BE TENS TO HUNDREDS OF KILOMETERS LONG. ALL OF THIS ISLAND IS CALCIUM CARBONATE. THIS IS CALCIUM CARBONATE BEACHES, CALCIUM CARBONATE DUNES. WE'RE STARTING TO LEARN THAT TINY, LITTLE BACTERIA PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN MAKING THE GREAT BAHAMA BANK. Narrator: IT APPEARS THAT TINY CYANOBACTERIA ARE BUILDING THE BAHAMAS. BUT THERE'S ONE BIG PROBLEM WITH THE IDEA. MICROORGANISMS, LIKE ALL OF US, NEED NUTRIENTS TO GROW, VERY SPECIFICALLY IRON. THE AMAZING THING ABOUT THE BAHAMAS IS THESE ARE VERY NUTRIENT-POOR WATERS. THE MAIN PROBLEM IS THERE'S NOT A NATURAL SOURCE OF IRON HERE. Narrator: WITHOUT FOOD FOR THE CYANOBACTERIA, THE CALCIUM CARBONATE THAT FORMS THE ISLANDS WOULDN'T BE LAID DOWN. SO IRON MUST SOMEHOW BE REACHING THESE WATERS. SO THE QUESTION IS, WHERE IS IT COMING FROM? Narrator: SATELLITE IMAGERY REVEALS THE ANSWER. AND IT'S ONE OF THE WONDERS OF THE NATURAL WORLD. THE ONLY KNOWN MATCH FOR THIS PARTICULAR IRON IS ACTUALLY THE SAHARA DESERT 3,000 MILES AWAY. Dr. Brand: IF YOU LOOK AT A SATELLITE IMAGE OF THE OCEAN JUST OFF THE COAST OF AFRICA, YOU'LL SEE THIS PLUME OF RED DUST THAT BLOWS FROM THE CONTINENT OUT ACROSS THE OCEAN AND ACTUALLY IS TRANSPORTED ALL THE WAY ACROSS TO THE BAHAMAS. THE REASON THIS DUST THAT'S BLOWING FROM THE DESERT IS RED IS BECAUSE IT'S REALLY RICH IN IRON. SO THE IRON IN THE DUST ACTS TO FERTILIZE THE CYANOBACTERIA LIVING IN THE WATER COLUMN, CAUSING THEM TO GO INTO OVERDRIVE IN TERMS OF PRODUCING CARBONATE. Narrator: THEY'VE BEEN DOING IT ON A MONUMENTAL SCALE. OVER 100 MILLION YEARS, THE BEAUTIFUL, TWISTING BAHAMAS HAVE BEEN RISING ABOVE THE WAVES, SHAPED BY THE WIND. Stott: ONE OF THE REALLY MIND-BOGGLING THINGS ABOUT SEEING THE EARTH FROM THE SPACE VANTAGE POINT IS THAT YOU SEE THIS INTERCONNECTIVITY. IT'S SO COOL THAT THE SAND THAT'S HELPED BUILD THEM IS COMING FROM SAND IN AFRICA. THOSE BUGS ARE STILL DOWN THERE. THEY'RE STILL WORKING. THEY ARE NOT DONE YET. THE BAHAMAS ARE STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION.
