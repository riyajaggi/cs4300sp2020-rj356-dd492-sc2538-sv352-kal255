I can't do this. - Eggs are ready. - Huh? - Oh, Jesus. - Shit. You know, you didn't have to stay. [sighs] You need to eat something. [Jen] I can't. I... [scoffs] I honestly don't think I'm ever gonna eat again.

 Come the fuck on! - You kidding me? - [Henry] Hi, Mom. Judy's back! Hi! - Hey. Morning. - Hi! - I missed you. - I missed you, too. Thanks for my bird. Oh, I should go get it. Huh? No, uh, no. Uh, sweetheart, why don't you just go have your breakfast right now? Then get your shoes on. I don't want you to be late for the bus. I thought Judy wasn't gonna be in our lives anymore. You guys are friends again, or... - Uh... - Um... - I'd like to think that's the case. - Not really, it's not like that. - I'm hoping... - She came to get the rest of her things.

 - [Charlie] Got it. - So... Oh. - Um, where are all of my things? - I burned them. Even my paintings? Look, I was upset. There was only, like, two. - My friend Parker just got a car. - Yeah. And Jake is getting his mom's Lexus. Oh, my God. No! Charlie, I can't. I've had my permit for, like, a week. - She won't even let me practice driving. - Okay, got you. Charlie, please, not now. Please. Okay? I've... I've had a really long night, and, um... you will practice. Okay? I promise you, honey. [under breath] Now fucking drop it... [in normal voice]...and go to school. Thank you. Why is the pool cover on? The pool cover? - Um, well, we thought that it was... - Something died. - What? - A squirrel. Dog. - Spider... dog. - It was a dog. - A dog died in the pool? - [Jen] Yeah. - A big one. - Yeah. [Henry] I lost my appetite. - [Judy] It was old. - The dog would've wanted you to eat. It was very old. - I think it might have killed itself. - Okay, that's enough. ["Best Things in Life" by the Dreamliners playing] ♪ Let's share your dream ♪ ♪ You and me ♪ ♪ So young and free ♪ ♪ Yes, these are the best things in life ♪ Thank you for not burning everything. I ran out of lighter fluid. I, um... I guess we... should talk about what we... shouldn't talk about before we don't talk again. Yeah. Yeah, we should. No one can ever know what happened or where Steve... I know. I'm not stupid. You know what, I'm hearing you say, "I know," but I also know that you tend to get a little confessy. Well, I got confessy with you because I couldn't let you believe that you were responsible for your husband's death. You lied a long time, though. I did, so you know I can. - Oh, you can. - Yeah. And I promise you, the last thing I want right now is to put you in any more danger. Oh, you know what? It's too fucking late, Judy. I am in a lot of fucking danger now. [sighs] I just don't understand how any of this could have happened. I told you. Okay? He got in my face. [sobs] And he tried to strangle me. And it was very scary. And I had to fight back because my boys were inside. Okay, but don't you think the police would understand? That was self-defense. Yes, it was. It was, but what am I gonna... How's it gonna look if I go to the cops? Steve killed my husband. And you're the one who fucking told me that his family's so fucking connected to the police. They are. The chief is his godfather. It's just a title, but... Not to mention my fucking house would be a crime scene, and... I'd be opening my boys up to an investigation. That would be very hard to come back from, developmentally. They already lost their dad. [sniffles] - They can't lose me, too. - No, you're right. You're right. I just... I was suggesting going to the police because I know how hard it is to hide something. - It takes a toll. - [sighs] [stammering] I just feel so bad. Okay, you know what? I don't need your fucking pity right now. What I need is for you to keep quiet. Okay. I'm so sorry that I started this shitstorm. [sniffles] And I just can't believe that he's gone. - Except he's not. - [sobbing] But he is. - Right? No. - No, he's not. You need to act like he's not. Right. Right. Right. All right. Um... Well, thank you for your help last night. - Feel free to call me if you ever need... - Goodbye, Judy. Bye. - Bye. - [door closes] Don't get any closer to me. I'm not going anywhere until you tell me where the fuck Judy is.

Hi. - Hey. Whoa, cute skirt. Uh, they're pants. Oh. Yeah. You should get them in every color. - Technically they're culottes, I guess. - [laughs] That's tricky. Listen, I wanted to ask you, I hope it doesn't sound weird, but do you think that I could crash in Abe's room just for a week or two? - I'm sorry? - Don't be sorry, I have my own bedding, but it's just that I miss him a lot, and I thought that maybe I could scratch that itch by sleeping in his room. Also, I do need a place to stay. I thought Angela said you were living with your family. Oh, I was, but now I wasn't, so... It didn't work out the way I thought it would. Okay, well, a new resident is moving into Abe's, and we're at capacity, so... Oh, wow, that's great, full capacity. I love that for us. Right? [laughs] But you have a place to stay. I mean... You got people, right? - Oh, totally. - Yeah. Totally, totally. - Good. - Totally. [crying] [continues crying] [grunts] [continues crying, sniffles] [whirring] - [Karen] Hey, neighbor. - Oh. Jesus Christ, Karen, snuck up on me like a fucking Prius. Sorry, didn't mean to startle you. Wondering if you want to have some orange wine tonight. Jeff's in Boston on business. Uh, no, I... what the fuck is orange wine? I don't really know. I saw it on a Reddit subthread about menopause, so... Oh, cool. No, I, um... I really need to go to bed early tonight, so... - You end up having a late night? - Huh? No. No, why? Oh, I just thought I heard a man back here. Oh, well, yeah. Must have been Charlie. - No, it sounded like a full-grown man. - [scoffs] Well, you got me. [laughs] I was... I was fucking a full-grown man last night. - [Karen] Oh. - Mm-hmm. Sounded more like an argument. Well, you don't know how I fuck. Right. Okay, so listen, I really need to get back to... Didn't you just get these cameras installed? [murmurs] Jesus Christ. I did, but, um, I changed my mind. Oh, I'm not surprised. I didn't wanna say anything, but Jeff and I really prefer the system we have. - It's the same one the Mossad uses. - Cool. You should see the resolution on our street cam. Your what? Our street cam. You could see the whole block. It's like a movie. [exhales] You know what? Fuck it. Why don't we have that orange wine right now? Uh, it's 11:30 a.m. Be cool, Karen. Okay, yeah. - All right, great. - Sounds cool. - Why are you standing? Go get it. - Okay, yeah. - Go get it. - All right. [whispering] Fuck me. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. Where is it? [chattering] - Oh! Hi, is this not 140? - [gasps] Oh. Oh, no, it is. Thank you. This is it? This is where you're dumping me? Yes, Mom. This is where I've spent my life savings to make you comfortable. This is a wonderful room. Best one in the place, if you ask me. See? Thank you. I'm Judy. I was just, you know, making sure everything's perfect for you. Thank you, Judy. This is my mom, Flo, and I'm Michelle. - Hi. - Are you the maid? - No, I teach arts and crafts. - [Michelle] Oh. So is crawling around on the floor an art or more of a craft, - would you say? - Both. You know, I like to make sure there's a tight tuck, 'cause... 'cause sometimes people really like that. I'm good at it, so I hope that's okay. Yeah, no worries. No, none, no. Great. Great. Well, it was wonderful to meet you... Flo. Bye. See you guys. Keep her away from me. [Michelle] Mom, there was no way she didn't hear that. [cell phone ringing] - [clicks] - [ringing stops] [Karen] The quality is amazing, right? [Jen] No, it's great, but is it even legal to spy on people like that? Oh, there's basically no privacy laws anymore. Oh. It's one of the reasons I'm glad I live in this era. - Oh, right. That's... - Yeah. - Not that it matters. - [inhales] Nothing interesting ever happens on our street. Except for whatever happened in this backyard last night. - What? - You know, with the... fucking. Oh, yeah. The... fucking. YALO. Or is it YOLO? I don't know, Karen. Okay. Look, it even has night vision. [Jen] Oh. - That's last night. - Wow, that's... that's really clear. [Karen] Mm-hmm. Do you like the orange wine? Yeah, yeah, it really coats the mouth. - [water rippling] - Um... How do you erase this? Do you erase this every day, or how do you erase it? Uh, I don't. I keep it all on the cloud. [rustling] [Karen] What is that noise? [panting] [loud click] - [whirring] - Wait, what are you doing? What the fuck? What are you doing? - There's a sound coming from your drain. - Huh? You don't want anything stuck in there. Could be a nightmare. - Yeah. Yep. [mutters] - Hmm? Here's the culprit. Yeah, that's just a toy. It's just a... Shouldn't be in there. Kinky. Oh. [rings] [Steve] Hey-o, you've reached TKG Arts, Laguna's leading art gallery for local and international artists, showing by appointment only. - You know what to do. - [beeps] - [Michelle] Hey, Judy. - Oh, hey. Is there a lost and found here? I found this cigar box someone left in the room. You know, hidden in the box spring? Oh, weird, someone left that there. Yeah, it's super weird. And I definitely didn't look inside to see that there was a bunch of weed and some car keys. Thank you. Oh, okay. Your hair smells so good. Thanks? You're welcome. [sniffles] [Jen] Okay, now you just, please, just be careful. Go slow. - Mom, it's fine. - Get your eyes on the road, please. I know. I know. Yeah. How... how do you know how to drive? Dad taught me. Oh. He did, huh? Or he was teaching me, right before he died. Was he? It was actually really cool, driving with him. I'm glad that you got to spend that time together. Why didn't you tell me? He said not to. I guess he didn't want to piss you off. - [horn honks] - [Jen] Watch out! - [sighs] - Oh, my God. Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm... Yeah. - Oh, my God! Watch where you're going, you asshole! It's a fucking intersection, - motherfucker! - He can't... He drove away! - Could've killed someone, fucking cunt! - Calm down. He can't fucking hear you. Fucking don't fucking cuss at me! [seagulls crying] - [keys jangle] - [engine turns over] [sighs] Thank you, Abe. [Jen] So I was looking online, and we can actually petition to get a stop sign at that intersection. - Nothing happened. - Hm? You... you're overreacting. Okay, well, I'm not. And you know what? Don't ever tell a woman that she is overreacting, okay? Because most of the time, women are underreacting. This is my reaction, which means that I am reacting perfectly. Is Judy coming back? - They broke up again. - Char. [sighs] You break up a lot. [Charlie] Can we go eat in front of the TV? Fine. [lock jangling] [lock jangles] [cell phone ringing] [sighs] [ominous music playing] [Henry shouting] Mom! Mom! - [Jen] Hey. Hey, Boop. Boop. - Mom. Boop, honey. Are you okay? Did you have a bad dream? - Yeah. - Oh. [exhales] You want to tell me? Well... [stammering] I was alone in a room. And... and someone... someone was taking you away. Oh. Do you... Do you know who it was? I'm not sure, I couldn't tell. Oh. Yeah, that... That is a bad dream, huh? Yeah. Do you know what? You know it was just a dream... because I'm right here. [sniffles] You are not alone. You'll always have me. Okay? You'll always have your mama. [kisses] - Close your eyes. - [sighs] [crying] [continues crying] [exhales] [sighs] [rings] Hi. Hi. Hi. I didn't think you'd answer. I didn't think you'd call. You left your, uh... bracelet here. Oh. Sorry. I, uh... You can just throw it out, or... burn it or whatever. Oh. Thought maybe you left it here on purpose. Like, as an excuse to see me again. - Did it work? - [mechanical whirring] [inhales] [mechanical beeping] What's that sound? - [whirring continuing] - [Jen] Where are you? [Judy] Um, I'm, uh... parked outside of my old dentist's office. - Dr. Nguyen? - Yes. You go to him too? - [thuds] - Shit, I was gonna roll up the window, - but I fell. - [laughing on TV] I guess it took Mrs. Garrett's crisis to bring us together. Yeah. How much longer are we gonna have to keep up this act? [Blair] We'll just have to keep this up until she's over her little problem. Then everything'll be back to normal. [Nancy] Yeah. We don't want to break... Thank you for having me over. Well, I'm not gonna have you sleeping in a car. [scoffs] I slept in a car for, like, a year with my mom. Really? Mm-hmm. Might have been a year and a half. Wasn't that bad. It was a hatchback. Oh, God, Mrs. Garrett. - [sighs] - Oh. Don't you wish that you had a Mrs. Garrett just tell you that everything's gonna be all right? Yes. Everything is gonna be all right. That's not as good. - No? - No. - [laughs] - Sorry. [Judy sighs] [crying] I don't know what to do, Judy. This... this feels impossible. Oh, no. I know. I know you know. I'm right here. [Jen sniffles] Okay. [sniffles] I didn't realize I had it so good when I was just, like, regular unhappy. Yeah. God, I would kill for some down-the-middle depression right now. Just some real good, - deep dissatisfaction. - Yeah. Shit. I'm sorry. It's like I forget for a second, and then I just remember about Steve. Yeah. [sobbing] I know we weren't even together, but suddenly, I can't imagine my life without him. I'm... I'm... I'm sorry, Judy. - I'm so... - [sniffles] - I'm so, so sorry. - No, no, no. Don't be sorry. He was attacking you, and it was not your fault. Yeah. I'm not going anywhere until you tell me where the fuck Judy is. Please just leave. I don't know why the fuck you're protecting her. She just feels sorry for you. Poor little widow, all alone, cheating husband. Boy, he was miserable, wasn't he? Fuck this! I'm out of here. - [grunting] - [Steve winces] [exhales] - Judy. - Yeah? Can... Can I... can I give you a hug? [crying] - [Jen] No, no, no, really. - [Judy] Really? Yeah. No, it's fine. I mean, you can stay until you find somewhere permanent. Okay, and to be clear, you burned all of my stuff? Well, not your blanket. And some of your crystals wouldn't take the hint, but... Oh, also... - Thank you. - Yeah. Hey. Parker's gonna be driving me to school. Oh, is that a telling, not an asking? Pretty much. Guess you guys can't stay away from each other, huh? Hey. [Jen] Oh, excuse me. Wait a minute. Do I know this Parker, and does he have a license? Uh, yeah, she does. Wear a seat belt, please! - Do you think that they're... - No. [doorbell rings] [Jen] Coming. [knock on door] Good morning.
