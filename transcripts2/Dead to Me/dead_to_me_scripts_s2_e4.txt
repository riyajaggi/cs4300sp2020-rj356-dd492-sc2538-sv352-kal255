 Ooh, God, I gotta pee. Then stop drinking so much water. Because I have so much dust in my throat. - Well, then, drink some water. - Okay. Oh, no. - Oh, no, no, no. - What? Is my phone in my bag? - What? - My phone. Can you look in my bag and see if my phone is there? No, I don't see it. Oh, fuck, fuck, fucking fuck!

 I think I might have left it back there. - What? - Yeah. You wouldn't do that. Why would you? - I don't know. - You must have it somewhere. I don't. I fucking don't, Judy. We have to go back. Oh, my God, what if I left it in the hole? - Oh, Jesus! - Oh, my God. - Wait, I'll call it. - No, don't fucking call it! - Why not? - Are you fucking insane? - Why? - If it rings in the hole, it's like a megaphone saying, "Hey everybody, there's a fucking body in here!" - You're right, that's insane. - This is a disaster. This is a fucking disaster! This is a... Oh, here it is.

 We're fine. Fine. Oh, my God, is that for us? Is it? How could it not be? It's right behind us. I know. Um... I hate to say this, but we are two middle-aged white women in a Mercedes. I know, and I appreciate you acknowledging your privilege, but we also just buried a body. Which nobody knows about. Pull over. Shit. We have shovels in the car. We were gardening. Oh, God, in the forest? How do you think forest people get their food? Well, what, were we planting fruit trees in the forest? Berries for foraging. Foraging! Say we were planting berries for foraging. We're berry planters. Got it. Oh, God. - What kind of berries? - I don't know. Raspberries? It's not raspberry season. - Forget it, okay? Just don't say a word. - Okay. - Don't say anything, Judy. - Okay, I won't. Maybe I should just gun it. - You can't gun it. - No, I think... - Hi. - How are you? Was it worth it? - What? - What was? Was what? You committed a crime. N-no. You're driving. As soon as that phone is in your hand, you're committing a crime. Oh. - I didn't know that. - What was so important you had to look at it while driving? - GPS. - The... - Yeah, the maps. - Yeah. I couldn't... You don't need the GPS. I can tell you where you are. Up shit's creek. I'm just messing with you. You're getting a ticket, though. Oh. - You should've seen your face. - A ticket. - Silly Willy McGilly. - License and registration. Yep, yep. You really can't wait till a hotel? I've been holding it in for six hours. Excuse me. Um... Uh, what... what kind of pie is that one? Cherry. Is it, um... is it good? It's cherry. Well, cherry can be shitty, but what about that? What's... Cherry. Oh, okay. I guess I'm gonna have the cherry. I can't fucking believe we got a ticket. Now there's record we were here. Fucking Shandy. This pie is really dry. - You want some? - No. Oh, man. It's just like, everything hurts. It feels like my spine is trying to claw its way out of my back. You sure you're not hungry or anything? They have waffles. I'm not hungry. Look... I feel bad that we couldn't attend to the more spiritual tidbits that you wanted to include in what we just did, but... we couldn't risk getting caught, Judy. I mean, we really had to get in and out, right? I mean, yeah, right. But it took a really long time. It's not like we just got in and got out. - Right, we had to... - Refill? Yes, please. Thank you, Marva. Marva, could I get some whipped cream for this? It's a little dry. Thank you. Look, all I'm saying is that we just didn't have time to, like, dilly-dally. - I wasn't trying to dilly-dally. - You know what I mean. I just wanted to sing a song for Steve or maybe say a few things. I know. But we didn't know who was out there or who could hear us. Okay, so I'm sorry if I got a little rigid 'cause we couldn't stop to sing "Halle-fucking-lujah." Just so you know... Thank you. I wasn't gonna sing that song. I know it's played out. I just wanted to give... give the moment a sense of occasion. This is what I'm saying, Judy. Not everything is a fucking, like, Disney-movie's-about-to-start fucking castles with fucking sparkle time, okay? We are not in Snow White here. We are in fucking Scarface. Well, I've never seen that. Neither have I. No girls have. But we know what it's about. Really? She did that on purpose. Shouldn't we have stopped someplace less fancy? It's just a shower pit stop. I know, but I didn't have time to Trufflepig my way through Priceline, okay? I just... I can't handle this level of dirty. I feel like a frat house toilet. You think we're gonna get a room? It's so last-minute. It's the middle of nowhere. No one stays here. I'm sorry, we don't have anything available. What's that now? We have a wedding this weekend, so we're all booked up. I'm sorry. Okay, you literally don't have anything? Hmm. Yeah, thought so. Oh! Actually, I can offer you our presidential suite. It's a two-night minimum, but the rate... I don't want to know. We'll take it. I got this, okay? My treat. Are you ladies in town for business or pleasure? - Pleasure. - Business. - Business. - Pleasure. No, it's just a gals' weekend with my best friend. My befri. Right? Yeah. Who the fuck gets married in Antelope Valley? People from Antelope Valley? Oh, I guess. - Jen. - Jeff. - Hey. - Hi. - Hi. - Hi, Jeff. Hello, Jen. Judy, this is... You know my neighbor Karen? - Yeah. - Yeah, this is her husband Jeff. - Oh, wow, Karen is so nice. - Yeah. So hi. - Yeah, she's great. - Is she here? - Uh, no, no, no. - Bummer, bummer, bummer. Okay, all right. Yeah, it's just a business trip, so... - Great. - You here for the wedding? - No, we're having a girls' weekend. - Oh, fun. - I got our coffees, babe. - Oh. - "Babe." - Thank you. Jen, listen, could you... - ...maybe not... - Yep. All good. Mm-hmm. - Okay. - Yep. Nope. The only reason that I even put... - We were never here. - Sure. - It doesn't have to go that far. - Okay, bye-bye. Thank you, I just... thank... oh, fuck. Oh, my God. I can't believe we did that. We still have to deal with his car, but... I think that... I feel like we might be okay. I guess so. - Do you want to take a shower first? - No. Want to get out of those dirty clothes or... do you just want to stare out the window weirdly? Yeah. Okay. Hey. Is there power? Yeah, it just came back on. Oh, well, that's good. Well, not fucking really. Now Henry, Christopher, and Henry's weird friend are dancing around to Jesus Christ Superstar. Okay, you know what? Language, Charlie. Don't denigrate Jesus Christ Superstar. It's a great fucking show. Whatever. I don't even know why Christopher's here. We would've been fine on our own. Now they're driving me fucking crazy. You know what? Why don't you go out for a walk and say "fuck" outside instead of sitting there, moping around? It's 100 degrees out. I can't walk anywhere. This is why I need a car. With climate change, it's only getting more urgent. Oh, wow, well, thank you for mansplaining to me why you are the most affected by climate change. Charlie, you're going to get a car soon enough. But for now, like I said, you're getting Dad's bike. Well, when is that gonna happen? Uh, when I have time to go to the storage unit, - which is a whole thing. - Whatever. Look, we, um... ...we'll be back tomorrow from Judy's sick aunt's place. She was kind of touch-and-go here, - but I think she's gonna pull through. - Great. Okay, well, love you. Bye. Wait, did you say you loved me enough to buy me a car? No, I said I love you. Bye. Hey, I just need to plug in my phone. It's dying already. So, how are we? We're okay. Okay, yeah. I know... last night was a lot, but I... I just feel like we're on the other side of it, Jude. Is there, um, anything I can get you or, just, like... Want me to get you a spa service, like a nice massage or something? Oh, look at that. TripAdvisor gives it almost three stars. Don't know why you would print that. No, thank you. You want a mani-pedi? No? I'm not really in the mood. Sorry if that's bothering you. Jesus, Judy. You're not bothering me. Okay? Are you mad at me? Because it's okay to be mad at me. No, I'm not. Okay, well, can you please just tell me what to do here? Because you're the nice one and I'm the shitty one, so just tell me how I can do something nice for you. Because you're scaring me a little. I just don't really feel like talking right now. Okay. I think I'm just really tired from six hours of digging a hole in the forest that ended with dumping my ex-fiancé in that hole. Yeah, okay. Yeah, sure. Hey. Hey. You up? I am now. What's going on? Um, I, uh, have an idea. There's, uh... There's a bar down in the lobby called Whispers and Winks, and I just thought maybe... we could go down and... do a toast to... to Steve. Really? Yeah. I mean, isn't that what people do after a burial? Right? Commiserate, drink... Let it all out. - Okay. - Yeah? Did you say "Whiskers and Wings"? No, why would it be "Whiskers"? No, it's "Whispers." - Oh. - And "Winks," like psst! Psst! Psst! I am gonna need you to shower, though. - 'Cause... - Yeah? Just 'cause... I stink? Mm, you just... You just look dumb in those clothes. They're yours. Hi. Hi. What can I get you? Uh, we'll get two double scotches. Okay. If you're with the wedding party, it's open bar. Oh, we're actually... The bride is my second cousin, so, yeah, we'll just get the Johnnie Walker Blue. Thank you. - It's pretty loud. - It's a bar. Thank you. Thank you. To Steve. To Steve. Um... Do you want to say something about him? This isn't really what I was imagining, so I don't... Okay. I don't really know what to say. Well, um... He was very good-looking. - He was more than that. - Right, of course. - You didn't really know him. - No, I didn't. He was very thoughtful... and sweet. - Okay. - He was. Okay. He used to always do these little things for me to make me feel special. Aww. Even the way he proposed. Yeah? What, um... How did he propose? - With a flash mob. - Oh. Aw, that's... that's so fun. I thought we were just going to the beach for the day, but then 200 people jumped up... and did this whole choreographed thing to Cyndi Lauper. That's very thoughtful. He really had a soft side that he didn't show a lot of people. Mm-hmm. Okay. I know you didn't like him. You have every reason not to. I know who he was. I get it. But I loved him. He was the first person who ever... really made me feel loved. He wasn't always perfect. But he was my person. No, I know. No, I... I know what you mean. Hmm. What? - What? - No... There's this thing I always wanted to tell you, and I just never... never felt like it was the right time. - What? - I don't know, just forget it. No, you can't tell me you have something to tell me and then not tell me. - Yeah, I hate when people do that. - It's annoying. - It is. - So just tell me. Okay. The morning after we... hit Ted... I woke up, and... Steve wasn't in bed, so I went looking around for him... and I found him at our favorite spot by the beach. And he was just sitting on the wet sand. He was crying like a little kid. It's not that he didn't care about what happened. He was gutted by it, but I just don't think that he was able to... ...show his feelings, you know? Mm-hmm. But I think he felt safe at the beach, and that's why I kind of wanted us to take him there... and put him to rest. Yeah, I get it. I just wanted... I just... I just wanted to say goodbye to him. He always took such good care of me. I just wanted to do something for him, too. What's wrong? Are you okay? I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. You deserve to say goodbye. I got to do it with Ted, and... Just, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. - No, no, no. - It's not fair. - Don't cry. I don't want you to feel bad. - You don't have to take care of me. - I'm sorry. - Don't take care of me. I can do whatever I want. It's why Steve loved you. Because you are... ...you are, like, the kindest person maybe in the whole fucking world. I love you so much. I really do. I love you so much. Will you be my person? Yes. I'll be your person. - Hey, there. - Oh. Do you guys want to dance? - Oh! No, thank you. - What the... - You sure? - Oh, my God, excuse me. Do you see that we're in the middle of something here? Does it look like my friend wants to fucking dance? Read the room, fucko. What in the hell is fucking wrong with people? Seriously! - Oh! - Poor guy, he just wanted to dance. My God. "Those girls look like they might kill themselves. Maybe they want to get a nice jig in before they jump off the bridge." What an asshole. He really is. Oh, God. I do actually kind of feel like dancing. - What? - I don't know. - With that guy? - No, no. With you. With me. Okay. Okay.

Judy. - No? - Those guys are joined at the dick. - Aww! To Karen. - Oh, to Karen! - Whoo! Can we have two more, please? - Um... yes. Yeah, I know you're not with the wedding party. - Excuse me? - What? You owe me $83. What? Douche. And get the fuck out. Psst, psst, psst. Oh! Oh. Oh, Christ... Hello. Wait, wait, wait. What? Oh, shit. Are we sure that it's the bird? That it's our bird? Henry is sure. What happened? Everyone was having a fun time. Then I stepped in here for two minutes to make lemon ricotta pancakes, and as I was grating the zest, I heard a scream, and I was too late. The bird was already dead. Okay, but how? Um... The dog did it. Probably just animal instinct. - I am so sorry, Jen. - Oh, God. I told Alan she needed to be professionally trained. But you know what? This is not like her. Adele is not aggressive. I mean, she is a snob. She won't wear synthetics. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay, baby. It's okay to be sad. I just... I just wish I knew it was the last time I was gonna play with the bird. I would have said goodbye. You can still say goodbye. In your hands, O Lord, we humbly entrust our brothers, sisters, and birds. In this life, you embrace them with your tender love. So now, deliver them from evil and bid them eternal rest. Let us find in you comfort in our sadness and the courage to move through this together. Amen. Judy, would you mind singing something?
