 In 2013, a secret research group at CERN discovered a quantum particle called Exotic Matter. XM affects the mind in polarizing ways, and may have been doing so for millennia. Covert organizations began unlocking XM’s power. Two Factions emerged. The Enlightened see XM as the path to a new era. The Resistance as a threat we must stop. We’re exposed here, I don’t like it. Some risk is necessary. Why’re we here? Why Hulong? To save humanity from itself. What I’m about to show you is extremely sensitive.

 Hey! Got her! We all thought you were such a promising researcher. How unfortunate. What were you even thinking? You’re research is... tainted data. Whatever it was, it wasn’t XM... it was dark... Your false sense of righteousness has let you down. Sarah, we’ve got your accomplice too. Tell us your plan and we’ll go easy. What exactly are you two after? Who are you? You don’t know me yet Sarah, but I know you very well. You are far more special than you ever thought you were. You see the unseen, Sarah. You know that something is very wrong. Stop! Why are you saying this? This isn’t how I imagined meeting, but fate doesn’t negotiate. I am here to guide you, Sensitive. Watch carefully. Trust what you feel, not what you see. You discovered the truth and they tried to stop you. But you will not be stopped. There is so much more for you to do. -What's he talking about? -Contain him! The world around you is not what it seems. But you know what it can become, Sarah, and how to lead it there. Destruction leads to creation. Remember that in the times to come. No! Log in to Ingress, Agent. It’s time to move. What’s Hulong’s explanation for an explosion of this scale? Just a faulty gas line. That’s all. What about the rumors that your company’s experiments caused this? -This place got blown to hell. -I'm telling you that's not the case. -Are you saying this was an accident? -Uh, consultant. Passing through. -Please, just remain here. -We're fortunate there were no casualties. Just a gas leak, huh? Sounds like someone else’s problem to me. I wouldn’t be so sure about that, sir. Not seeing any traces of a gas leak. And the only witness to this fiasco is out cold... Shouldn’t we get her to the hospital? Her brainwaves, pulse, and respiration are all normal. Besides, she’s the closest thing to a lead we have. We need her. Hold it. Hey! This area’s restricted to authorized personnel. Yeah, but... I'm supposed to... Hey. Let him through. He’s a contractor. Yeah... what he said. Sorry it’s so late, but welcome to the circus, Makoto. Oh, right. Midorikawa. Makoto Midorikawa. It’s... nice to meet you. Yeah, likewise. What happened? Right. Well... You can see the place is burnt to a crisp. We just don’t know why. Okay, understood. Glove coming off. Yeah. Do your thing. And he’s... A special investigator. We’re trying him out. For now, at least. Special investigator? That kid? I know... apparently he sees memories of whatever object he touches. Objects don’t have memories. Gimme a break. A “psychic investigator.” That's what they’d call him in America. He’s cracked a few cases already. What's wrong? Did you see something? They all just... burned up! No... vanished. Why not her? Is this guy all there? We haven’t found a trace of human remains. Even if they were burned, there’d at least be some bone. -Hold it. Hey! -Get back! Thank you for your hard work, detectives, but it’s time for you to leave. What? This matter is now Hulong Corporate Security jurisdiction. Who's this? My God. Pack it up! Huh? Really? What was that call about? Orders straight from the Director General. -The Director... -Let's go! Uh... what? -Go on. Your work here is over! -Clear out. Sarah Coppola... She survived. The hell was that? Acting like we’re in their way... They’re making it clear we’re not wanted. Makoto... sorry we wasted your time, kid. But since you’re here, why don’t we grab a drink, huh? I’m buying. Uh, sorry, I have plans... Sure you do. We’ll grab a drink one of these days, kid. Enjoy those “plans” Makoto. See you around. Hang on, Inspector. Really... How long have you known this kid? -We have a history. Come, drinks on me. -This I’ve gotta hear. Ouch! Come on... No! -Hey! -It’s just... he sees my memories. Come on, Makoto! Over here! -Let's go! -Wait for me! Oh no... It’s happening again. -What is that? -It's creepy. What’s his deal? Is he crazy or something? -My mom said not to get too close. -Weirdo... How is something like that even possible? EXPLOSION AT HULONG LAB POSSIBLE GAS LEAK They’re calling it a gas explosion? Why cover it up? This is getting interesting... Who are they? ANYONE GOT INFO ABOUT EXPLOSION AT HULONG TOKYO? SOMETHING IS VERY WRONG. THE WORLD IS NOT AS IT SEEMS. A virus? AND IT IS IN DANGER. Sarah... ONLY YOU CAN HELP. WHO IS THIS? WHAT AM I HELPING? IT'S TIME TO MOVE. What is this app? THIS IS NOT A GAME. OK, then what is it? THIS IS YOUR FIRST PORTAL. PORTAL. HURRY OR THE WORLD... TOKYO MEDLAB HOSPITAL It looks abandoned... Hope the door’s unlocked. Why did Brandt want me to protect you? You again. You’re here. Were you messaging me? Or are you actually... asleep? Okay... what’s your deal? Hang on a second! Let me explain! Shut up. I’m doing the talking. What happened to Christopher Brandt? What happened at the lab? Christopher Brandt? I... I don’t know him! If you don’t know him then why are you here? Do not test me. I will end you right now. I came here because... she asked me too. Coma girl gave you a call? You’re gonna need a better lie. I’m not... lying! She... Told me... check my phone... Do I... know you somehow? What’s wrong? There’s someone here! L-Let's go! I’ll go check it out Okay. No! Sarah! Who are you, anyway? Huh? O-Oh, Makoto. I mean, I’m Makoto. And why are you helping me? Good question. I haven’t really figured that yet. Who in the world are you? Why is everyone after you? You tell me. I can’t remember. I can’t remember anything. You have... amnesia. HULONG TOKYO RESEARCH LAB Hulong? You want me to go back there? Guess you’re not sending these. Then who is? And what do they want? Let’s head to Hulong. It might help with that amnesia. Uh... Ok... Sarah. That’s your name. Sarah. Right now that’s all I know, but there’s more there... trust me. Okay. Hulong’s Lab. The site of the explosion. Remember anything? Hey, Sarah? Huh? What the hell is this? I remember... I am... a researcher here. They caught me when I was exposing their experiments... Experiments? About what? XM. Exotic Matter. It’s a quantum substance. And they want to bend it to their will. And that’s, uh... a bad thing? XM. It has the capability to directly affect the human mind. In their hands, it will be used to betray humanity. We have to stop them! Stop them? Sarah! Do you hear yourself? Oh... Sorry. The thing is... It’s so crazy, even I wouldn’t believe it. That’s what I felt in the vision... She’s like me... And she’s lost in all of this too. But... Makoto... I need you to believe. Because right now... It’s us against the world. I believe you. Maybe we’re both crazy. We were unprepared. Who has her? What are we dealing with? We don’t know. We think it was Brandt’s bodyguard and the Japanese contractor hired by the cops. They say he can read the memories of things... The psychic detective... Of course... You wanna go back inside Hulong? It’s a crime scene! Your stuff’s there? Yeah. My phone, my wallet. My security access pass. Hopefully some clothes, too. It's him! What? -Makoto! -Stay back! We’re gonna sort some things out... Subtitle Translation by Rika Takahashi
