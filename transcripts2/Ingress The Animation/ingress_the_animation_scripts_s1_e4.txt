 Makoto! Here! All ground forces surround the premises. Use all available resources. Do not fail this time to secure her unharmed. Roger that. Threat threshold has been crossed. Activate Ingress now. The exit’s up ahead! Hurry! What are we gonna do? The mountains are our best bet. No! Dammit!

 Makoto! No! Don’t shoot! Move it! Wait! Hold your fire! We need to bring the target in unharmed. Shit! Charlie team. Target is moving to the roof of Area C. -Get moving! -Roger! The hell? No! You, keep going. Continue without me. Are you out of your mind? I’m your best chance of staying alive. What's that? That helicopter is bad news.

 It’s you... You have been extremely troublesome, Sarah. Back off! Wait... Hold. I'm the one you want, right? So let him go! He’s not your target. Please. Fine. As you wish. All teams, stand down. Do it! Yes sir! Come. It’s the only way. That’s a good girl, Sarah. Now... let Makoto go free. You can’t hide your fear from me. Sarah! What? Make sure you get rid of that bag of trash there. Makoto! Don’t hurt her! You said you’d let him go! Fire. You’re alive? Dammit! You just gonna watch, trash boy? What? This is your fault. Let’s move! Move your ass! I got shot! What do you expect? What the... Wait! Kid. You the prayin’ type? Wait, you can't be... Seriously?! You promised! Make them stop it! Makoto! Makoto! You need to calm yourself. No! Hey, head up next time. You are insane, man! Ow! You should be able to walk now. Okay, what the hell’s your deal? First you need to answer my earlier questions. Now’s not the time! They have Sarah! I put a tracker on the chopper. Let's go. Uh... Nice. That’s one hell of an entrance. Yeah. I’m not one for subtlety. Follow me! Wait, wait, wait! Why are we running towards them? This is insane! They've broken through the front. Alpha, Charlie, stay on them. Delta, seal the mountain path! Roger that! Seal off this path. Use the game trail. Get ahead of them. Roger that! They’re both expendable, shoot to kill. Are they gone? Yeah. I bet this path’s probably covered. Doesn’t matter. Wasn’t the plan. So you’re a Portal! Quit stalling, let’s move. Yeah. Thanks for the help, Mr. Monk! Sir, the targets have been found. It’s taken you long enough... now stop them. Make sure they die this time. They’re starting to annoy me. Roger! Listen up trash boy. Once we’re clear of this forest, you’re gonna tell me everything. That light! We’re out! Whoa! Move it, now. S-Sure. Make sure they die this time. They’re starting to annoy me. Roger! I’ll scout from the treeline. Watch out! They're above us! Kid, are you... a Sensitive? That makes sense. You can get off of me now. Get on! Hey! Why are you doing this? And who are you? We can talk when you’re on the damn bike. Now get on! Don't you wanna save your little girlfriend? Jerk. Human experiments with Dark XM? Sounds like ugly stuff. Yeah. Hulong’s pushing a huge project forward. Somehow, Sarah’s the key to it all. Is that so... And what about you? You’re Resistance, right? Is that why you’re up against Hulong? You said you can read an object’s memories, right? Uh. Yeah? Was this man at the site of the explosion? He was. But it looked like he died in the explosion. Who was he? Christopher Brandt, a scientist with the Resistance. Hulong took him, and I’ve been trying to find him ever since. I thought your lady friend might’ve been able to lead me to him. I see. Why would Hulong take him? Haven’t figured that out yet. Maybe he was trying to stop them, too. There was a time when Brandt was working with Hulong. But he cut ties. And they went after him. Just like they did with Sarah... I never knew why he quit working with them. But now I think I do. He said we had to come to Japan to save humanity from itself. I think he knew exactly what they were up to. So what’ll you do? Pick up where Brandt left off. You're going after 'em? -Get off the bike. -Huh? Oh, sure. See ya. Huh? Wait, wait! Hang on! Move. Why should I? It’s for your own good, kid. Are you serious? Come on! You can’t just leave me here! You told me what I needed to know. We’re done here. You’ll only get in my way. Going up against Hulong, you'll be screwed without my ability. If it weren’t for that, we'd both be dead already. Damn. I tend not to trust the Enlightened. Don’t gimme that crap. Look what we’re up against! If we don’t fight together... We are done! Let go of me. Let me guess. You wanna save the world, right? Not at all. I just want to save Sarah. Get on. Look. Here’s the tracker’s location. Kansai Airport? If they leave the country, we’ll never find ‘em! Then we better make damn sure that doesn’t happen. Commander Liu. The charter jet is ready. Good. And the two Agents are heading towards us. Just keep them away from the plane. What the hell is going on? Hulong’s got the local cops in their pockets. I’ve got a few tricks of my own. Targets sighted! Heading down the main street towards Tarui! Have a nice nap? Where am I? Care for a drink? My treat. Where's Makoto? What did you do to him?! Where are we going... Where are you planning on taking me? Where it all started. There’s something there that we need your assistance with. How about we toast to the success of our project. Cheers. Makoto... Sarah! -What is it now? -There! They’ve got Sarah on that plane! How can you tell? I heard her! Her voice was coming from up there! I’m sure of it! Come on! We need to catch up! Move! Stop it, you idiot! You can’t chase a plane on a bike! Please! Flight Radar. It’ll show us their route. Bravo 25735. Damn, a charter. Can’t figure out the destination. It doesn’t matter anyway. We’re wanted men. No way we’re getting on a commercial flight. Our passports would give us away instantly. I know... Jack, listen. I’ve got an idea. Take me to this location. Trust me. I’ve got a solution. Oh goody. A manga... Cafe? Kill me now. I’m over here, Jack. What’re you looking up? Airport server has all arrival and departure information. I’m borrowing some. You know your way around. I used to do this for a living. You were... a hacker? Couldn’t hold a regular job. And it kept me clear of other people. Here’s the data... They're going to Switzerland. Switzerland... Now to wrangle ourselves up some passports. It’ll all depend on if our man’s in a giving mood. -Our man? -Yeah. An old friend of mine. He’s a counterfeiter. I'M LOOKING FOR AN OLD FRIEND WITH AN APPETITE. THAT REALLY YOU MAKO? It’s him! BEEN AGES. HEARD YOU'D GONE STRAIGHT. LOST YOUR EDGE. I got you now, Zion. SHARP AS EVER. ARE YOU? NEED TWO PASSPORTS ASAP. Two passports on the double? How much can you pay? Bastard, you really don’t ever change. MY CREDIT STILL GOOD? Huh? Hey hacker, your friend’s gone quiet. MY CREDIT STILL GOOD? OK, BUT I CHARGE INTEREST. PICS. PRINTS. 24H DELIVERY. All right! Is this guy someone we can trust? Yeah, he’s a total pro. Just gotta send this to him and we’re on our way. Whatever. Wait a sec! Where you going? Coffee. "Coffee." "Thanks! Great job, man... “ There. This is surprisingly good coffee. GOLGO 13 Rise and shine. How long was I asleep? About six hours. Sorry. Don’t be. I can’t wait to find out what happens next. Take these. They’re for you. Contact lenses? XM Optical Scanners. Grabbed ‘em off a Hulong thug. Whoa... I can see the XM. That’s right. They’re a Christopher Brandt original. I’m gonna rest. Wake me up if you need me. Hey... What now? This Christopher Brandt guy. Was he special to you? He was... the man who saved my life. I can walk by my damn self! Gently, please. She’s an important asset to our research. Of course, sir. Makoto... Sarah... Subtitle Translation by Rika Takahashi
