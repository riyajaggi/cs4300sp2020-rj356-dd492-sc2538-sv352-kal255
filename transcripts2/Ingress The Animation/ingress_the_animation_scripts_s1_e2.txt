 Why did you try to abduct this woman? You an Agent? Answer me! Agent? Eyes on the target. She’s with a local and that Resistance Agent. I want the woman alive... The other two dead. Do whatever’s necessary. Roger! The hell? Get up!

 -Grab the girl! -Right away! I see the Agent at three o’clock. Get him! -Don't let the target escape! -I got you! Control Field established. How’s he doing that? He’s a Sensitive. Let’s go. Welcome back, Agent. I was getting worried about you. What’s with that dude? This way! Some people’s natural talents are heightened through XM exposure. They're called Sensitives. And this guy’s one of ‘em? I’m one, too.

 Each Sensitive has different abilities. My ability allows me to see the invisible. So the guy chasing us... Oh, come on! Sarah! Wait! Up there! Alpha, follow after the targets. Get a sniper ready. Bravo, take down that Resistance Field, now! Copy that. Jack Norman. Brandt’s guard. Resistance. I’ve read your file. XM let’s you "Flash Forward." See future possibilities. He’s reading our moves, I knew it! Reading us? Yeah. It has to be his Sensitive ability. Damn. I gotta tell the inspector... You have insufficient time. YOU HAVE INSUFFICIENT TIME. Ingress... -You know it? -Yeah... It installed all by itself. Then soon after someone contacted me. Told me to help you. The world is in danger. Many forces seek to harness the power of XM. Those forces are split into two Factions, which are in conflict. The man tracking you is of the Resistance. Their Portals enable his power. What Portals? XM enters our universe from them. Look. This is a Portal. Your current location is surrounded by Resistance-controlled Portals. Those Portals unlock and feed his Sensitive abilities. What am I supposed to do? He has us cornered. You must choose a Faction. They hold each other in balance. This choice is yours alone. You have joined the Enlightened. I-It’s done! Now what? Use an XMP Burster to attack the Resistance Portals. Like this? Look! It’s working! But nothing’s happening! Just trust me on this! You’ve gotta keep going! O-Okay! Keep going. You’ve got this! That's enough! No more hide and seek. This is Bravo. We’re ready to destroy the Links. Attacking Resistance Portal now. Hey, any idea who fired those Bursters earlier? Don’t ask me. Makes our job easier though. Hurry and take down the Links. You still haven’t answered my question. What do you want with Sarah? Portal Links destroyed. Control Field destabilized. They’re working with you? Makoto! The Burster! Right! We gotta go! Sarah! Damn! All right. We’re moving! Makoto! This guy’s insane! Time to get the hell out of Dodge. No more excuses. If you lost him, find him! And get rid of him. And the other two? I’ll deal with them. Sensitives... I never knew such a thing existed... XM is full of powerful mysteries. We’re in way over our heads. We need to go to the police. I know they’ll help us. Fine. Come on... Turn back. The police have been compromised. Huh?! What are you talking about? This communication is unstable-- H-Hey! Eyes on the suspect. Requesting backup. You there! Just a minute! A person of interest in the Hulong Lab explosion has been reported kidnapped. The kidnapping victim is a foreign female in her mid-twenties. The primary suspect is Makoto Midorikawa. I repeat... That’s our guy? We were seriously contracting a kidnapper! Makes us look great... Media’s going to have a damn field day... Things will get messy once the word spreads. Especially for us, Inspector. Makoto... What the hell is going on? HULONG EXPLOSION WITNESS KIDNAPPED BY POLICE INVESTIGATOR. They think I’m a kidnapper. Seriously? I’m sorry I got you involved. Hulong's a powerful organization, but I didn’t know they control the police. I tried to uncover some of their horrible secrets. As long as you’re with me, you’ll be in danger. I don’t want you to get hurt, so... Thanks for everything. Whoa, hang on. For better or worse, we’re in this together. Besides, I’m a wanted man, remember? You can’t... We’re a team, Sarah. We can find a way to stop them. They’re pulling out all the stops to find you. Whatever it is you know must be pretty important. Important enough to hurt them... if you can remember. I can’t remember. Sarah? My memories from before the explosion... are fragments. Memories... What’s his deal? -Weirdo! -Don't get too close... No! He sees my memories... Makoto? I have something to say, Sarah. I think I can help. Memories?! Well, it’s not like I’m a mind-reader or anything. But, I see the past through objects that were there. Like your ring... If I look, I might see things that you don’t want me to. Just do it. Shall we? Walk with me toward the truth of this world. No! No, further back... before the explosion! This is what they were after... Everything was leading to this... I need this data! This place! Seriously? They said the unauthorized access came from this terminal. How? They would have had to get past security. Unless... We’ve got a security leak. Split up and find them. Hey! Spread out! She’s in here somewhere! Anybody out there... THE WORLD IS IN DANGER! Found her! You! Stay where you are! I’ve got her! I have to send this message. Please! Don’t! Makoto. What did you see? They were... working on some sort of top secret project. You learned something terrifying about it. The last thing you saw was a laboratory. It looked like it was in a forest... Do you remember that? S-Sarah? Hold on! What is... It’s here. This is where the project started. It’s happening again. You can see it too? The energy? I can see it right now! Someone is helping them. We need to find out who. We couldn't trace their signal, sir. Idiots. We’ve got a GPS lock on the Japanese guy. Continue. Seems to be in a vehicle heading toward Tokyo Station, sir. The train station? Our Kyoto facility. Get a squad out there now. What about the Resistance Agent? We have to secure the test subject. She’s our priority. Yes sir! Kyoto, huh? This is the Nozomi Super Express, headed for Shin-Osaka. Whew. We didn’t miss it! This train stops at Shinagawa, Shin-Yokohama, Nagoya, and Kyoto. Non-reserved seats-- It'll be nice to finally get a bit of rest. You said you’ve seen it? The hidden energy I see. You’re a Sensitive. A Sensitive... Nozomi Super Express headed for Shin-Osaka is now departing. Subtitle Translation by Rika Takahashi
