 Look what I managed to rummage up. So you wandered around to get us some food, huh? Of course! We haven’t eaten in a long time and I’m starving! You know what they say, don’t you? "Hunger is sharper than the sword!” They’re not wrong... Anyway, what makes you think I’m a Sensitive? Oh! Delicious! I know. Oh, it tastes so good.

 I was so hungry! So... I think your ability to read memories is caused by XM. I used to research how XM unlocked what we called "Sensitive Abilities" at Hulong. XM can... unlock certain people’s innate talents. And you are one of those people. So, If I keep using XM, then... You could enhance your abilities even further. Makoto, give me your hand. Please? Okay. Out there. See that Portal? It’s blue. It belongs to the Resistance. It’s powerful, but not to you because you’re Enlightened. Portals are usually blue or green. Those colors represent two kinds of power.

 Blue’s Resistance. Green’s Enlightened, like you, Makoto. Control Fields form when Portals connect, and that Faction’s power grows. The White Portals are neutral. Waiting to belong to someone. What is a Control Field? It makes XM more powerful within it and affects minds with that Faction's power. For Sensitives like us, we can use Fields to boost our abilities. Wait! So that’s how that guy chasing us could fight like that. Correct. But it goes both ways. The wrong kind of Field could rob you of your abilities, leaving you vulnerable. That’s rough. Whoops. Sarah! Hey! What are you... Wait! I haven’t finished my lunch yet! Boarded the train at Shin-Yokohama. Next stop is in 76 minutes. Secure the target. Kill the psychic. Sir! Dammit! We’ve entered an Enlightened Field! Use your psychometry! Psychometry? Your special ability! Use it now! -But I don’t... -Hurry up and do it! Okay What did you see? He’s not alone. This way! Here! Get in! The toilet? You serious? Isn’t there a better place to hide? Not in the toilet! Just go. We have to make a move. They’ll find us in here. Just stay quiet, okay? Everything is gonna be fine. Trust me. Three guys are headed this way from car 16. They are looking for us, just like he is. Which means that right about now... You want to get fancy? Now’s our chance! Wait! Now what? There’s nowhere to run! I got this. Hold my hand! It worked! Borrowing your smart lenses. Hey, what’s wrong? Uh. Well... Normally, I just see memories. But on the train I could see those guys coming for us. XM’s powerful stuff... That’s your power! You own it. XM just helps draw it out. Okay, so what do we do next? We have no lead. We need Field cover. It'll help you and hurt him. Perfect. Looks like there's one just ahead of us. -Is this it? -Yeah. Such a powerful Portal... Some ancient Sensitive felt this place and knew it was special. So the XM was already here when they put the shrine up? XM’s always been around us. And it’s been exerting its effects on humanity since the very beginning. XM contains... ordered data. A key. A signal. A signal? One that touches and unlocks parts of the brain. The people most affected by this are called Sensitives. Ordinary people can't see or feel it, but XM is all around us. The world is so much more than what it seems. So... what happened to divide the two Factions like this? A mysterious difference in perspective. The Enlightened feel XM is a way for us to discover ourselves and our destiny. They see our relationship with the Portals as symbiotic. A part of nature. Part of nature... I could see that, sure. The Resistance think XM's a threat. They want to understand and contain it. Contain it? They want to use its power, but only if it can be controlled... and bent towards humanity’s interests. A gift or a threat. Maybe it doesn’t matter. I don’t know which side is right. I see both. Ever since the discovery of XM, the Factions have been at constant war with each other. They fight over these Portals in order to expand their Faction’s Fields. So it’s a battle for territory? More like a battle for minds. The XM in the Fields influences those it touches. Whoa. Did those Portals just change? Yeah. The Enlightened must have taken them from the Resistance. Look. It was probably those two. Huh. I think I get it now. We should move... come on. Are you sure? They’ll spot us if we take public transit. I know! We’ll hitch a ride. Ok. We lost track of them, sir. We see you’re having issues securing the target. Sorry, sir. Temporary setback. No need to fret, Liu. I understand. These things happen to everybody... once. Respect the gravity of the situation. That traitor, Christopher Brandt, was out ahead of you... and was trying to destabilize the important work we’ve been doing. I’m familiar. Brandt knew how vital Sarah Coppola is. That’s why he orchestrated her escape. Whatever he was doing, it died with him. Our plan is already in motion and it cannot succeed without her. And there’s another pressing matter. People are starting to talk about that explosion. They're asking troublesome questions that we cannot afford. We expect you’ll take care of that. Right. Consider it done. I’ll have everything handled in 24 hours. There’s so many people here! Must be a popular tourist spot. Places where XM accumulates tend to draw in a lot of people. Some have even become famous tourist spots. That would explain it. Is this really the place? I’m sure of it. Hulong’s dirty laundry is right in front of us. It’s behind here. What the... A hidden path? Sarah, how’d you know about this? I see the world differently... remember? This is the way I’ve seen the world ever since I was born. Always seeing XM. I could see what others couldn’t. And when I reached out to it, I’d see visions of far away places. No one believed me, of course. My parents and friends thought I was crazy. They thought I was crazy too. I had the power to read memories... and that didn’t make anyone happy. They all treated me like a freak. I ended up alone. Wishing I could become somebody else. Anybody. If you were someone else, you couldn’t have saved us earlier. Without your power we wouldn’t have met! I kinda expected more guards... What do you see, what is it? It's red... What’s red? Is that a Portal, too? I think so... Let’s take a look. No don’t! Makoto! Are you okay? Y-Yeah... What just happened? That was... not pleasant. This place is no ordinary laboratory. No one’s here... Do you think they abandoned this place? Chaotic Matter? That red stuff from earlier. When I was working at Hulong, we called it Dark XM. The normal XM I showed you only affects the human psyche. But Dark XM has powerful physiological effects, too. It may provide a person an explosive burst of power... but it eats away at their body. Prolonged exposure is certain death. Why would anyone use it? Keep moving. There's nothing here. Makoto! They were running experiments on people! But what in the world for? Easy now. I'm just a little bit tired... But you were right. There’s something wrong with this place. Oh wow. Wait! The servers are still running? The console should be... here. It’s no good. I’m locked out. Let me see. You’re pushing too hard. You’ve used your abilities too much today. You’ll hurt yourself. It won’t kill me to give it the ol’ college try. Besides, it’s not like we’re going to get into it any other way. I'll leave the rest up to you. Good job. Thanks. What is this? What’s this research all about? “Physiological Side-effects of Controlled Psychological Manipulation.” Manipulation? They were studying mind control? This was the reason for all the human testing? So they could... control people? This is me! But... why am I on here? Makoto! Don’t make me hurt him, Sarah. Talk to me, and I’ll let him walk. When this all started, I thought you were just another target to secure. I was told to protect you. But Hulong’s after you, too. Their orders are to bring you in alive. So, what makes you so special? I’m not special. Just trying to, uncover Hulong’s secrets. And that... that made me a target! If they just wanted you silenced, you’d have a bullet in your head by now. There's a reason they want you alive. What’s your connection to them? Maybe they want to take advantage of your ability somehow. Makoto! I’ve got you right where I want you. And you’re all out of moves. Checkmate. You can’t run away from your destiny forever... Sarah.
