 Incredible. Sarah’s creating new signals every second. I want you to push her twice as hard. I don’t know if she can take that kind of strain! I didn’t ask. Now do it. Yes sir. Her signal output’s multiplying! Makoto! CERN, where it all began. Six years ago, the secret Niantic Project revealed the existence of XM. CERN... Sarah, is that where you are?

 "Truth." I assume that means yes. Sarah! Are you okay? Damn it! Can’t you hear? Sarah push through! Here goes nothing Makoto... and everything! What the... What’s this? Jack, do you know what this is all about? I got nothing. She must be trying to tell us something. Sarah’s stabilizing. Output is off the charts. Incredible. Her abilities are beyond what we thought was possible. Sarah... I need to understand what you’re trying to say!

 Hey! What’re you doing? The only thing I can. What good will that do? You just read memories, don’t you? It’s not about what I can do. It’s Sarah. Reach through! Open your mind! Makoto! Danger awaits in the Portal Network, Agent. Where am I? Mornin’, sunshine. What happened? You don't remember? Okay then... Makoto! Sarah?! It worked. Can you hear me? I can. Are you okay? Not really. I’m far from okay. They're doing some experiments on me using Dark XM. You have to fight back. Nothing will stop us from saving you. Are you really talking to her? Makoto. Why is he with you? That’s a... pretty long story. His name’s Jack. We had a bit of a rocky start, but he’s with us. Can she hear the both of us? Yes. She says she can. I need to ask you something, Sarah. My boss was Christopher Brandt. Have you met him or know him? She says no. Stop lying lie to me! He came to Hulong for you. Gave himself up! I’m not lying. He said he came to Hulong to save me. That’s all I know. And then... Destruction leads to creation. Remember that in the times to come. He went up in flames. Ridiculous! It looked like he just exploded. Like the blast came from inside him. You’re saying he blew himself up? Impossible. I saw it too when I touched Sarah’s ring. You expect me to believe that?! It doesn’t make any sense! And how do you manage to survive without a scratch?! Brandt must know the reason. Maybe it wasn’t just an ordinary explo-- What’s wrong, kid? Makoto?! It hurts... You pushed yourself too hard. It’s too much for you -Sarah! -What? Cut us off. He’s done. Sarah... We’re coming for you. I guess I blacked out after all that. What makes you so sure that Sarah’s not lying to us? I just know. I told you. I saw that same mem-- I don’t care. I don’t buy any of it from her. Or from you. Doesn’t matter, Jack! Our goal’s still the same. We still have to find Sarah. Help her. And put a stop to Hulong “Walk with me toward the truth of this world.” Just something Brandt used to say a lot. You the head of the Brandt fanclub or something? Christopher Brandt was unique. Not like anyone else I’d ever met. It was four years ago... I was a mercenary. Dodging bullets and chasing a paycheck. I didn’t know how my ability worked back then, just that it did. That's when I met him. I’ve got a job for you, if you’re interested. I'd like to use your power for protection. How’s that for a change of pace? What do you want me to protect? I’m a scientist, you see. Researching a new particle called XM. XM? It can influence the mind, but it doesn’t dominate or control it. A sort of guidance, one could call it. It’s been very divisive, of course. Some see XM as salvation. Wisdom and Enlightenment. Others resist it as a hostile force. A takeover of the human mind. And then there are the nefarious who see it as a path to power and profit. You’re in deep with zealots, rebels, and others who don't like you. A sad truth, yes. But truths can always be changed. My research could guide humanity toward a whole new way of being. An end to conflict, famine, disease and discrimination. Imagine how humanity could advance. If that were just within our reach, don’t you think it’d be worth protecting? At first, I figured he was either naive or deluded. Living some utopian fantasy. My world was ugly. Full of death, pain and apathy. The way he laid out his vision resonated with me. Damn! Brandt! Get away! Jack! It was the first time I’d used my ability for a noble purpose. I’m still kicking, aren’t I? I thought I was going to lose you. You gotta stop scaring me like that. Don’t give me that. I’m doing my job. And I’m doing mine. Protecting life. In whatever way I can. I’m glad to have you back. You’re the reason I’m alive and back here. I’m grateful. Are you going to continue your research? The research never stopped, my friend. We humans are a curious species. We fight over mysterious things. I worry that if we can’t figure out XM’s true nature soon enough, we’ll cross a point of no return. The true fabric of the universe is right there in the XM. And it’s trying to show us by guiding our minds. I believe XM can save us from our insatiable desire of self-destruction. I refuse to stop until I’ve accomplished that. It’s weird... a scientist believing in destiny. If your vision can get us there, we’ll be better for it. Lots of people will want you dead because of it. So that’s why I’m gonna protect you. And this crazy dream of yours. He woke up something inside me I thought was dead and gone. It sounds cheesy, but he gave me a new life. The job was simply to protect him, but it grew into something so much bigger. And then he tells me to watch after her. And so now, I guess I’m just carrying that burden. And that’s why you’re still working with me to find Sarah? You want to stop Hulong, don't you? Let’s give ‘em hell. That’s amazing. What now? Danger. Ambush. 200 meters. Jack! An ambush! Ouch... Move! Hold on! Dammit! Where are they shooting from?! There’s more?! The group surrounding you is not Hulong. They are not your enemies. They may be able to help. What? Wait! Come back! Don’t move. Right here. She’s been transmitting these Glyphs. Dozens of them during the experiment. This one is special. It’s carrying a data wave. We sampled this signal and reconstituted it as sound. She was communicating with someone through the Portal Network. -Let me hear her. -Of course. -Channelling speech through XM... -Incredible, don’t you think? Are we assuming that whoever she was transmitting to can decipher it? -Where is she? -What? Where the hell is her damn portal?! I’ll get that for you right away. Here. The Portal’s here. Oh, I see. This worked out well. These guys aren’t Hulong? No. Take a look around. That emblem. That’s the Enlightened eye. So they’re all on my side? This isn’t good. Jack? -Check them. -Yes sir! Hey! What do you think you’re doing?! Jack’s never done anything to you! Stop, dammit! Do you have a deathwish? Wait! He’s Enlightened. He’s not a threat. I’m the enemy here! You make a good argument. Hold your fire! Weapons down, guys. They aren’t your enemy. You their leader or something? I’ve managed to earn a bit of respect, but that’s about it. Hank Johnson. Nice to meet ya. Johnson! You know him? He helped discover XM at Niantic. Highly respected among the Enlightened. So what’s your story? Enlightened and Resistance, an odd pair. What gives? Now I think I get the picture. You’re both on the warpath against Hulong. Your buddies almost put a stop to that. Sorry, but you kicked the hornet’s nest. What? They were protecting this place, and you were armed. Tag along? You see that? That place is sacred to the Azmati tribe. Enter a conglomerate with Resistance ties. They barge in and set up a mine. Sounds like Hulong. The Azmati tribe has protected this land for generations. Their beliefs have a lot in common with the Enlightened ideology of today. But with much more history. So those guys were Azmati. They tried to protect their holy grounds. Fight back against the mine. But the conglomerate brought in their mercs. A private military force called Strategic Explorations, or SE. There’ve been casualties on both sides. Deepening the rift between Resistance and Enlightened. Each new attack breeds its own counterattack. So you can’t blame them for not trusting the Resistance. That would explain it. And your fancy visor? Raised some eyebrows. Why would the company choose this place to build a mine? There’s a very special reason for that. See for yourself. Dark XM?! One of few Dark XM Portals on the planet. XM and Dark XM react with each other to produce rare, highly valuable minerals. I found this in Japan. Is this what you’re talking about? Sure is. That’s a Dark XM crystal. A crystal? Yeah. Something Hulong was working on to stabilize Dark XM. What's it for? You name it. It could be applied to any kind of technology. Every major institution in the world is chasing this tech right now. Those are the SE's. It's dangerous to linger. Let's head back to camp. I get their situation.. But they have to realize that Hulong is too big. The Azmati don't stand a snowball’s chance in hell. If they know they’ll die, why fight? What drives them? The Azmati have a legend. One they’ve passed down generations since ancient times. “Those that die on sacred ground will rise again and again... With flesh immortal, their minds reshaped and reborn.” That legend gives them the courage they need to fight. As for the truth... Those crystals aren’t the only use for Dark XM. Under the right circumstances, Dark XM could cause someone who has died to recurse. Recurse? The Dark XM forms a new being that carries on the mind, body and soul. A Simulacrum. A living person formed of XM. Recursion? Simulacrums? No! That’s crazy! I’m just telling you what the Azmati believe in. Legends are thought vessels that travel through time. Containing, every so often, a grain of truth inside. It’s SE! A full frontal assault! We’re in danger here. This way! Go! Go! Time to wrap this up. Subtitle Translation by Rika Takahashi
