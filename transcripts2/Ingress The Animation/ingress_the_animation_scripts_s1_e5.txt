 The suspect, Makoto Midorikawa, is traveling with a companion. Caucasian male, early forties, tall. If they close the airport, we’re screwed. We gotta move. Are you ready for what lies ahead, Agent? Pretty sure this is the right spot. Hey! Over here. Zion! That guy? Yeah. A blast from my past. Sorry to drag you out of your basement. Don’t be. Had some action out here anyways. Let’s go somewhere private. You and I have a lot to talk about. Your face is over the web. You kidnap someone?

 Of course not! Just gimme our-- Say no more! Your care package. Tickets and some props. Props? You never know! They’re on the house. I’ve already done the beauty pass on your docs. Be sure to dress the part. These are pretty damn good. Anything for an old friend. Just remember that when it’s time to pay. Zion, is that... Oh, this? It’s called Ingress. You know about that? It’s all the rage! I’m an Enlightened Agent in a global battle for the fate of humanity. Somebody compromised the Ingress scanner. And now people everywhere are using it to fight for control of the Portals. Sarah told me something about that, too. They managed to disguise it as a game to cover it up. It seems your pal here is a devoted player. You an Agent as well? What Faction? He's with the Resistance. I’m Enlightened, though. That’s a good choice, my friend. All the best are Enlightened. Let’s help turn the world green, shall we? Crap, they took it! The Resistance move so fast! What are you doing? My mission! We’re creating a Supernova at the tower near the zoo. What the hell is that? You don’t know? Prepare to have your mind blown wide open. When you create many Links to one Portal, that Portal becomes incredibly powerful. And it looks exactly like a "Supernova!" Damn, I gotta get to the next Portal. My operator needs me in 10 minutes! Yeah, Zion, we should get out of here too. -Let's see... -Hold it. We’ve wasted too much time here. We’re surrounded. If we get out, we’re made. Can you use your ability to see how they’ll react? No... too many Enlightened Links. I can't create a Field. One more favor. Take us to the airport, now! No way, I’m linking! Now! You drive a hard bargain. I still have a mission, though. You’re going to have to help. This bike matches the VIN number. Then he’s nearby. A motorcycle used by the kidnapping suspects has been spotted at the Nishi-Shinsaibashi Chuo-ku. Narrowing the search to the local area. Requesting additional backup. Hey! Be careful! You're gonna burn yourself. Hot! But tasty. Fleeing the country, exposing evil plans. You’re living in a fairy tale, buddy. You think we’ll make it through the airport? Gotta move fast. Careful with immigration. Make sure you use an auto gate. Thanks a lot. I owe you one. I’ll send a bill. Hey, when you land in Switzerland, cap some Portals! So XM is real and this is not a game... Alright then, maybe the world is not what it seems. We’ve just arrived at the airport. Get rid of them as soon as you find them. Be discreet. Sir. I really hope this works. Next in line, please. Keep moving. There are multiple terminals. We made it through. Your guy’s good. Maybe you are useful for something. He wants us to be discreet in an airport? Shut up! If we screw up again, we might be next on Hulong’s hitlist. So stop your bitching. Guys, there! It’s them. Come on! We’re here. We prepared this area just for you. I think you’ll find it familiar. What the hell are you going to do to me? There’s no need to panic. We’ll be studying your unique abilities. Just like while you were at Hulong. We need those abilities for a very important project. So until that project is done, I will need your full cooperation. Make sure you don’t hurt her. This is nice. I like flying first class! Didn’t realize your buddy’s such a high roller. He’s just a hacker who knows how to work the system. Now that we’re heading to Switzerland, how do we find Sarah? I’ll have to figure it out. Got any leads? Like where their headquarters are? Hulong’s HQ is in China. Don’t know of any standing facilities in Switzerland. In any case, we’ll deal with it once we get there. Yeah... Progress is at 89%. Glyphs encoded in the signal. Starting our analysis. Look at that! The signal’s so strong. It’s funny how she’s unaware of her true power. Visualizing XM is just a scratch on the surface... TARGETS ON PLANE BOUND FOR SWITZERLAND. WE'RE ALSO ABOARD. HOWEVER... We’re now at cruising altitude over India and expect an on-time arrival. DON’T BOTHER ME WITH DETAILS. TAKE CARE OF THEM. NOW. Now what? The local time is 4:30 p.m. The weather is clear and sunny. Are you crazy? They can’t use XM up here. I’m sorry, sir. First class pass-- Did you hear that? -No, I didn’t hear anything. -I’ll take a look. You think it’s Hulong? Keep your head down. What?! What’s going on? This can’t be happening! THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY. USE IT. YOUR FAMILY WILL LEARN OF HULONG’S GENEROSITY. UNDERSTOOD? They're crazy to attack us here! Where'd he go? They’re all dead! Damn! I’ll see you bastards... on the other side. That son of a bitch. Oh shit! Now what? We’re going down. What's happening? They need to make... -Can you fly? -I missed that class. We’re losing altitude. Things aren’t looking good. -Dammit. -Wait. Move. It’s my turn. Your what? I got this. For real? You sure? Quiet. Clever. Tapping into the memory of the instruments! He opened the fuel reserve! We can't fly this thing! -Hold on! -Wait, what? Brace yourselves! Everyone prepare for impact! That really worked... Nice job. I can’t believe it. You just saved our lives. Yeah. I didn’t think I’d be able to do it. That was pretty damn impressive. Your ability’s stronger than you know. H-Hey! Unfasten your seatbelts. We’re going to get you off of this plane. Leave all your luggage behind! -You’ve pushed yourself too far. -Please remove high-heels! Let me give you a hand! Follow the person in front of you and head to safety! Let’s go. We can’t be here. Jack. Where are we going? You’ve pushed your abilities to their limits. Totally drained yourself. We’ll find a place to recover. A crash landing? Any survivors? We haven’t been able to establish contact. I need somebody to get me an accurate report. The data's shifting. We don't see any of the original signals. These are new signals, and they’re coming in fast! You’re there now, Sarah. Am I really doing this? Did that test unlock my power? Is that... Makoto? You dragged me here... for a Portal? Portals heal. It’ll recharge your power. Trust me, you’ll feel better soon. Try and get some shut eye. Right... Makoto! Makoto! Can’t you hear me? Hello? Jack, what is XM exactly? And why is it all over the planet? Wish I could say I had all the answers. I know it’s a subatomic, information-bearing particle. And that it flows into our universe from another dimension. Another dimension? It’s not from ours, that’s for sure. Imagine an underground water vein. But with XM instead of water. And then in some places it just shoots up. Like a spring. This isn’t answering my question. Look, it’s a metaphor, kid. I’m doing the best I can. People felt these locations were special, so they built monuments on them. Crowds gathered at those monuments, the XM hotspots, and the rest is history. Some say all the Portals are connected. Like one big underground lake. And at the bottom of which is an archive of humanity’s collective memory. Christopher Brandt, my old boss, was researching that. He was trying to unlock what he called the infinite possibilities of the medium. And our abilities have a connection to that? Yeah. I’m guessing your ability uses XM to tap into that big archive of memories. Using that archive helps me peek into the future, too. I see... What does that mean for Sarah’s powers? Makoto! Why can’t you hear? What can I do? All right. We need a new plan. We’ve gotta figure out how to get into Switzerland. Right. And locate Sarah. You ready to go? Yeah. What the hell was that thing? A Glyph. A Glyph? Encoded signal inside the XM. Each shape means something. We just need to know what this one is. "Help." Look! "I." "Past." "XM." "Discover." I wonder who’s sending this message. It’s Sarah. I know it. She’s just full of surprises. We’ve got a new signal. This one’s completely distinct. She’s there! She has to be! Hell of a clue... I think I’ve got this figured out. Six years ago, XM was discovered in a top secret lab in Switzerland. Here’s where this all began. The Niantic Project, under CERN. We’re headed into the eye of the storm.
