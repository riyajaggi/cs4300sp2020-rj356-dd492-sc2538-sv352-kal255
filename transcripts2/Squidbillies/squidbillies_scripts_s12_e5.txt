 Have a good weekend! Just blows my mind, the lack of patience. You've supported these people for how many years? Uhh, this one-act play is tiresome. Over the table? Well, that's a nice change. "I'm so glad we're friends." me, too, mr. Halen, but, uh, where's the money? You know, kink in the payroll system. You heard me explain it before. But I'm not on the payroll, I'm on the take. This is dirty money you give me. Just give me some more of the dirty money, right? Just between us, I'm not as liquid as I would prefer. Well, hell, neither am I! Look, I'll be your muscle, Mr. Halen, but not on credit. Muscle? Huh. You boston cream doughnut of a man. You'll do what I say when I say where I say. And you'll get paid when I choose to pay you. Clear the room. Come on! Git! Have a good weekend! Denny, no! - Blows my mind! - Thank you, Denny. We'll settle up next week. Yep, kink in the payroll. Unlike some people, I get it! Hey, uh, did you hear anything else about our checks... It's a kink in the payroll system! You think you're the only one this affects?! Hey, daddy! What are you doing here today? Yeah, you usually ghost us on the weekends. I know! But how in the hell am I supposed to spend my weekend dranking if I don't get paid?! And what am I supposed to tell all them folks at the liquor store, huh? Hell, they depend upon me! I've got mouths to quench. One mouth. My mouth! Daddy, where you takin' that stove? To the goddamn pawn shop, I guess! I need a son of a bitchin' drank. Well, it looks like someone's on the take. - Nice work, detective. - You better keep your head on a swivel, little man, 'cause the minute you take that flak jacket off, you're in for a world of hurt. ...You're in for a world of hurt. Hmm, internal affairs might be interested to hear this. And you run internal affairs. Well, isn't that convenient. You appointed me 'cause your ass was too lazy to do it. I had enough on my plate doing my illegal side hustle for mr. Halen! ...Doing my illegal side hustle for mr. Halen. Well, I got a tape recorder, too, tough guy. ...Doing my illegal side hustle for mr. Halen. Damn it, it's my word against mine! I'm screwed! Huh. An eviction notice? This is Mr. Halen's house. Looks like he ain't been paying his rent, either. I mean... It's a kink in the payroll system, right? That's what he told you? What did he pay you to beat my brains in? A valentine's card? Yeah. Look. Mine plays music. The only kink in that payroll system is there ain't no money in it. Come on, let's go do some legitimate work for once. What do you mean I'm not big enough to not fail? I just skirted under the not fail-able line? I mailed the payment. Did you not receive it? Well, in that case, I rescind my wish of happy valentine's day! Now who's a hot fudge sundae in a suit? Ow, ow! Hombres, vamanos! Tomalo todo! This property and everything in it now belongs to the bank! Por favor, no! Don't drag the obelisk. At least put a slider under it! Be careful with that lamp! Show some respect, that was once a man! That's a mythological creature! I purchased that former NBA All-star Allen Iverson! Kink in the payroll, huh? You know what, just go ahead. Take it all, they're just possessions. I can buy them again, just as I bought you! Well... well, we're not for sale. Anymore. Everyone has a price. And yours was less than his, by my reckoning. How much did you get? Please, let's not talk about this. It just makes it weird, man. You think this is the first time I've been down? I'll be back. I am a winner! No, not the window! The door was open! Ohh, what were you thinking? I should have stuck to my core business... Tape, mud, and gypsum. The basics! But no, you had to have more. And now you don't have a pot to piss in. That's a nice story. 20 bucks, sugar. Send the invoice to melissa. We pay in net 30. Net 60 for you, though you're a new vendor. Ellis! Wait, wait, wait! Here, take this lamp. And why don't you plug it in, maybe shed a little light on the mistakes that led you to shed your clothes for a living! Whoa, hold on now, Ellis. This oughta cover it. Oh, thank you, baby. And some of that fancy-ass party liquor with the gold flakes in it. We'll have that. How do you have money? I pawned my family's cast-iron stove so I could get toe up. I'm a big wheel tonight! Yes, I remember how that felt. But the wheels have completely fallen off for me. Oh, you'll be back. Once you figure out that kink in the payroll... There is no kink in the payroll system. My business has cratered. Dan, I know what you goin' through. It don't feel good to be stretched thin. Oww! Oooh! Damn, this hurts. No, it do not feel good to be stretched thin. Let go, Ellis! Ow, God! Here, this liquid will make you feel better. It plays a magic trick on your mind-brain. Go ahead, guzzle it down. Hell yeah! Come on! Let's beat the shit out of somebody! Whoa! Hold up now, chicken-dog! Hey, daddy, ain't this your boss man? Used to be. Flip him over so he don't choke on his own regergitant. Is that a griffin? Griffin meat's good meat. Don't you touch this man's ride! That's all he's got left in this world. Aww. Hey, mr. Halen. Hey, boy! Wake up! Git you some breakfast. Wakey, wakey, paint's a-flaky! I like peeling it off in long strips. Like flatbread. You'd think eggshell would be tastier, bein' named for a food. But that's marketing for ya. You started on the new section without me? Where the hell's your manners? Can I... get a ride into town? I'll give you a ride! I'll give you the ride of your damn life! Whoo! Whoo! Wha-ha-hooooo! Hell yeah, bay-bay! Come on! Belt ya out a whoo, Dan! It's short for "whoo-hoo!" whoo! - Are we going anywhere? - This is it. The journey is the destination, as they say. Yes, they say that to dumb people. So we're going to drive in these circular shapes all day? Pfff, I ain't got enough gas for all day. Well, okay. It's no wonder you've never left your mark on the world. Oh, I've left my mark on this world. That there's my mark right there. "Push butt." oh, oh. Hold on. Hold on now. A muse is a-callin' me. "Pu butt!" 'Cause poo comes out of the butthole! I just plushed this son of a bitch! Yes, you'll be remembered in the history books. Well, just what kind of cool shit have you ever done? I don't have to scratch my letters into a hand warmer with a buck knife! My letters are embossed in 20-foot-high solid br... Oh, my God! I had hundreds of employees. The largest building in all of appalachia! I owned this town and all of those within it. But it was all a mirage, a facade propped up by shady junk bonds. Sure, I cut corners to make it work... who doesn't! But every year we had to make our sheetrock thinner and thinner to make the knot, until those paper-thin walls came crashing! Stop spinning, you moron! I'm pouring out my soul here! Hey, can I have me this here spinny business chair? So, you're back to square one. Square one ain't too bad. Me? I never left square one. I was born here, I lived my whole life here, and I'll die here within the next 6 to 12 months because of something badass I'm gonna do involving a roman candle and my butthole. It's the simple things, Dan. I got land, I got the sun, the wind. And... I got me a big letter, too! This is the early building now! Hell yeah! You know what, you're right. It's about the simple things. I see it now. I see it now! Whoo! Wa-hoo! The journey is the destination! Whoo! That's right! That's the lesson I've been teachin'. Whoo-hoo, I say! Ow! Aw, shit. I done throwed the caster. I need to get me some off-road tires for this son of a bitch. Wee! Wee! Wee! What the hell? Daddy, you gon' wanna see this. You were right, early. It's the simple things. It's not about owning possessions. - It's about leasing! - What the hell! You have the land, the sun, the wind. I'm just leasing it as a third-party broker! No! Get this tree huggin' bull off of my land! Hell, I didn't sign nothin'! Oh, you don't own it. She does. We've arranged a barter situation. Mmm, griffin meat's good meat. Goons, clear the room. But this is a porch! Ow! A... and it's private property! Tell it to my muscle. You hear that Denny? He called me muscle. And I'm back! Whoo-hoo!
