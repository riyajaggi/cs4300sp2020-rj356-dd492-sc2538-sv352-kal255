 See that aspiring model there? That was me... Deb. Until the day I died. I thought I'd go straight to Heaven, but there was a bit of a mix-up and I woke up in someone else's body. So, now, I'm Jane, a super-busy lawyer with my very own assistant. I got a new life, a new wardrobe, and the only people who really know what's going on with me are my girlfriend Stacy and my guardian angel, Fred. I used to think everything happened for a reason...

 Whoo! ...and, well, I sure hope I was right. Drop Dead Diva 3x06 - Closure Original air date July 31, 2011 Sync and corrected by atrn97g www.addic7ed.com Bingum. No! They're a surprise for Sandra in accounting's birthday. How do you feel about murder? Mm... against? Good answer. You'll be on loan to the D.A.'s office for the next two weeks. I'm going to be a prosecutor? - You bet. - Ah! Their budget was cut by 20%,

 and they're reaching out to the private sector for help. You should be honored. The D.A.'s office asked for you by name. I am honored. Why me? Don't play coy, Bingum. It's not your game. - No, I sa... - Oh. Here's a surprise. Sandra in accounting is diabetic. Red velvet. My favorite. $10,000 spread over three credit cards. How does a 14-year-old girl get credit cards? She doesn't. She used mine. Ms. Bovitz, I'm a litigator. This is sounding more like a parenting issue. This wasn't Pammy's fault. She went online and bought clothes and accessories with mommy's credit cards. Did she not? She was brainwashed. Really? - Have you ever heard of "hauling videos"? - No. M... may I? Please. Pretty young women video blog about their shopping sprees. Pammy was brainwashed by this shallow shopaholic. Look. O.M.G.! This awesome cashmere blend is the softest fabric ever. Feels like a bunny's bottom. It will change your life. I know it changed mine. I don't believe it. I know. And that vulture gets over 20,000 hits a day. There should be a law against it. Actually, there is. Ugh. I once temped at the D.A.'s office. Lousy coffee, fluorescent lighting, industrial carpet. I still have nightmares. Well, you better hope they've remodeled, 'cause you're coming with me. - Do I have to? - Um, yes. You're my assistant, and we're a package deal. Teri, Parker said that they asked for me specifically. Do you know why? Jane, you worked there for two years straight out of law school. The civil service employment act requires a three-year commitment to take a job at the D.A.'s office. But wait, why was I only there for two? You never wanted to talk about it. Okay. Time to go. I will see you there in a couple of hours, madam prosecutor. Ah. Hi. Excuse me. I... - There she is. - Hi. I'm looking for an Alan Roberts? Ouch. Eight years. I haven't changed that much. Okay, maybe the hairline a little. You haven't aged a day. Oh, thank you... Alan. Come on. So, Jane, I can't tell you how much it means to the office, and to me, you're coming back and helping us out. Oh, of course, no problem. So we're a little cramped on space. You'll be stationed in the war room. I know it's not what you're used to. Oh, I'll make do. Wow. Are these all my cases? This is all one case. The Elena Estrada murder. I'm sure you remember. Elena Estrada. Yes. The mayor wants a briefing. I'll tell you what. Why don't you review the files and we'll catch up later? Okay. - And, Jane? - Yeah? I'm glad you're back. Thanks. Hello. - Bingum. - Parker. - Tell me something. - If I can. Is it possible Kaswell's still interviewing at other firms? How would I know this? Hello? Parker? Hello? Ugh. Parker, are you there? What? Uh, never mind. Get back to work. Kim! Uh, Ms. Kaswell. Yes? I was proofing your new client memo, - Mm-hmm. - and, um... Busy, Fred. Get to the point. Uh, you're suing my girlfriend for blogging? I am. For monetary damages under the federal communications tort liability act. But, yeah, y... you can't do that. No, no, I can. Law school. What puzzles me is how your unemployed-actress/unemployed-model girlfriend can afford the crap she's pushing on unsuspecting teens. I mean, $500 sunglasses? Oh. Is that what this is about? She doesn't pay for the stuff. The company gives it to her for free. For free? Yeah, as in gratis. Each week, another box shows up, and she video blogs. All from the same place... the Pacific Holding Corp.? Yeah, that's right. So, you can... you can sue them, not her. Right? Well... Per the FCC, the provider of free goods is off the hook... total immunity. But the blogger is liable for failing to disclose material connections. What does that mean? It means your girlfriend broke the law, and now she's going to pay. A lot to remember, huh? Uh, yeah. Well, there have been a few cases since. - You want to refresh my memory? - Sure. 18-year-old Elena Estrada boards a bus two blocks from her home in east L.A., heading to the Persky estate in Malibu, to visit her friend, 19-year-old Nate Persky. She never made it. Well, we believe that she got off the bus in Malibu but was abducted on her way to the Persky estate. Oh, right. She was killed with this machete, which was wiped clean and wrapped in a workman's tarp. And tossed in the Tampico Ravine. - Right. - Right. Oh. We have a person of interest, Carlos Granados, a local gardener. Yeah. Eight years ago, we couldn't make it stick. - Yeah. - But now we can. New evidence? New technology. Vacuum metal deposition fingerprint restoration. Couldn't get a print off of a rough fabric like this. But now we can, and we did. One set and they're a match. We're getting a warrant. That's great news. Uh-huh. Jane, before you dig in here, can I ask you something? Okay. Why did you agree to come back here? - Oh, Park... - I mean, was it just the work or... us? Us...? Oh. It's been a long time. Yeah. Oh, my God. He kissed you? Right on the lips. I had Teri ask around. It turns out, he and I... well, he and Jane had a whole fling thing going on. Really? I was totally surprised and kind of impressed. - He's cute. - Mm! Well, you say he's older. How old? I don't know. - If he were a Baldwin, who would he be? - Stacy. Stephen, Billy, Daniel [Gasps] Or Alec? No, I'm not playing this game! Oh, my God, you like him! Shut up. You don't even know anything. He is just my boss... again. - Okay. - What's this? Some guy gave it to me when I was getting out of my car. I think it's the new curry menu for that place that we love. No, Stacy, this is a complaint against you. No! I'm sure it's a mistake. Stacy, this is a legal document. You're being sued for operating your video blog. What? Well, do I have to take it down? The constitution implicitly states that congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of girl talk. Oh. Okay. The attorney on record is Kim. Ugh! That bitch! Well, at least I'll have you to represent me. While I would love to kick her butt, I can't right now. I'm at the D.A.'s office. Um, but don't worry... I will talk to Grayson first thing in the morning. Um... Can I help you? Fred. Uh, you know, I seem to have misplaced my cellphone, and I thought I might have left it here. You're... ringing... Sir. I'm gonna level with you, man to... assistant. Kim is dating someone, and you're gonna tell me who. I... I have no idea, and she is not the type to share. I expect a full report by tomorrow. Jane, hi. Oh. Good morning. Listen, I have to apologize for letting my emotions get the better of me yesterday. Oh. I guess I didn't realize how much I missed you. Well, it was just a kiss. Not like you have anything to apologize for. Do you... have anything to apologize for? No. Okay. How 'bout we talk about Elena? - Right. - Yes. I'd like you to go see her mother, Anna. Let her know about Granados, and tell her we're gonna need her for trial. Of course. I will do it. - Okay. Thanks. - Okay. Yes, Ms. Bingum, I remember Mr. Granados. But are you sure? I mean, my daughter knew him, said he was a nice man. I can imagine how hard this is for you. It was so long ago, and... if my daughter had not been so compassionate, she'd still be here. Really? How so? She was on her way to visit her friend. Nathan Persky. Yes. He was having a hard time staying sober, and Elena was hoping she could get him back in the program. - And that's where they met? In A.A.? - Yes. Come. I... I show you her room. It's just like the day she left. - Those are beautiful. Did you knit them? - No. My daughter. She had all this energy when she quit drinking. - Hmm. - She took up knitting. Told me that it was relaxing. When I was a little girl, my mom used to knit, and she used to say the same thing. Oh. Are you still close? Uh, not so much. Work and life... you know. You always think you have more time, Ms. Bingum. Like spring to summer, your wardrobe transition should be seamless. This Pacific sundress with scoop back is perfect for a beach party... Oh, don't pause it there. I smile in the next frame. You have a great smile. It's even whiter in person. Thank you! - Ms. Barrett... - That's me. When Pacific Holdings sent you merchandise, did they ask for any remuneration? Uh... Did you pay for the stuff? No. They gave it to me for free. And in exchange, you praised every single item. I love everything they sent me. Even the sequined leggings that only a fashion-challenged lemming would wear? Really, Stacy? Really? Uh... Stop! Stacy... You have fabulous taste. All of us think so. All of you? Your followers. There's like a whole fashion blog devoted to you. And the leggings... are awesome. I bought 'em last week. Oh, sweetie, you are beautiful, but those leggings are awful. And it's all my fault. I would like to turn myself in now. No more questions. Okay, here's the deal. I'm negotiating with Pacific Holdings to take back your client's merchandise and refund the purchase price. Would that be acceptable? What about damages? Are you kidding me? Ms. Bovitz, I will go online and apologize. From now on, I swear, nothing but the truth, the whole truth, so help me, Hermes. Okay. Okay. Okay. You were working in the area. - Yes, but I... - And you knew Elena. We've been through this. I'd never hurt her. And I never even saw her the day that she was killed. By your own admission, you didn't leave Malibu until 6:30, when you went bowling. Elena arrived on the 5:45 bus. She would have walked right by you. Her body was wrapped in a tarp. Your fingerprints were on that tarp. Maybe somebody snagged that tarp from the back of my truck. Look, don't need your statement for a conviction. We have more than enough for a trial right now. She used to call me "tio"... "Uncle." She... was... my... friend. She even said that she was gonna knit me a scarf. I'm sorry. What did you say? She was knitting me a scarf. Uh, excuse me. What is going on? Alan, come look at this photo. From the surveillance camera, we know Elena started knitting the scarf at a bus stop in downtown L.A. I count five, - maybe six rows? - So what? So, this scarf we found with the body is 150-plus rows. It would have taken at least 2 1/2 hours to knit that much. But the MTA says the route's only 57 minutes. So, according to your math, she could've managed... what... 60 rows tops? Right. Which means she must have gotten off somewhere along the way to Malibu. And she would have had to wait for another bus. So why did she get off the bus? Well... The autopsy report said she had fructose corn syrup in her system consistent with carbonated soda. Maybe she got off because she was thirsty. Yeah, maybe she wanted sugar. You know, recovering alcoholics do crave sweets. Okay. - So she gets off the bus to get a drink. - Uh-huh. Then waits for the next bus, which gets into Malibu at... 7:15. Way after Granados left for the bowling alley, consistent with his account that he never saw her. Granados didn't do this. Alan... we have the wrong man. So, I just got off the phone with the Mayor. He said to thank you personally. Okay. Why? You saved us an embarrassment... prosecuting the wrong man. You're welcome. Tomorrow, I'll be assigning you another case. What? We haven't finished this one. Well, we're out of suspects and leads. We can't just drop it. The case isn't dropped. It's just cold again. So, Jane, when you left this office... when you left me... you said it was for personal reasons, but you never told me what they were. Um... Honestly, that part of my life is a blur. Okay. Okay. Tired? Why? We could get some dinner. That place by the pier with the macadamia halibut? I'd love to. So, while Pacific's hot pants are cute, I cannot recommend them. They ride up, exposing way too much France in your underpants. Hold on there, followers. My roomie is home. I will be right back. Ooh! Somebody's wearing yesterday's outfit. Tell me everything. I had the most amazing halibut. Okay. And then? And then... we talked. And then we talked some more. And we spent the whole night talking. Well, I guess that makes sense. He is over 40. Stace, he offered me a job... as a full-time prosecutor. But you already have a job. No, I know, I know. But listen to the offer. No perks, no car allowance, no expense account, - and the pay stinks. - Ugh. Well, I hope you let him down easy. I haven't answered yet. - Huh? - I love my job at the firm... I do... but the D.A.'s office just feels more important. I mean, do I want to be "lady lawyer" or... "lady justice"? I vote for Lady Gaga. No, but seriously, normally, when I pull an all-nighter, I just want to sleep all day. But I can't wait to change my clothes and get back to work. Are you stealing pop-tarts? The D.A.'s office has day-old coffee and a box of triscuits from 2004. There's nothing gourmet about civil service. Well, I'm glad you're here. Uh, I need some advice. Talk fast. I want to get out of here before the hummus goes bad. Parker wants me to tell him who Kim is seeing. Oh, juicy. Who is it? I don't know. And even if I did... you can't violate the assistant's oath to protect the boss' secrets. Fred. What do you got? I decline to answer your inquiry on grounds it violates my oath. Mr. Parker, you want to know about Kim? I can find out. Hey. She's not my boss. Plus, I happen to be a licensed private investigator. For two box seats to the "grease" sing-along at the bowl, I'll get you every dirty detail. Look at me. I'm Sandra Dee. Oh. Ms. Estrada. I heard señor Granados is not guilty. I was gonna come see you this afternoon. We made a mistake. So, what happens next? - Um... - Please. Don't tell me you're giving up. If there's a new lead, I promise we will pursue it. For you. Oh. A picture of Elena. We have pictures. Now you have another one. Thank you. Was that Elena's mom? Yeah. I gave her hope and failed. You did everything you could. Teri, get me anything... and I mean anything... that we haven't reviewed... I want to see it all. You got it. This bag is adorable. Too bad it's so heavy it'll pinch your nerve and destroy your posture. It's like an anchor with a leather handle. I say... "return to sender!" It's awesome, Stacy. "Return to sender" is my new catch phrase. Brilliant! Fred, talking to Stacy? I sure am. You want to say hi? No. I want her here as soon as possible. Stacy... I heard. I'm on my way. Ooh. A secret meeting in the park. It's so... John Grisham. Why are we here? I will tell you in a minute. For you. You're welcome. Oh. What am I looking at? Does the phrase "D.A.'s jacket" ring a bell? Is that a dark blue sports coat? Because I've noticed they all dress alike. Every A.D.A. keeps a personal diary of case notes. They're usually locked up in an off-site warehouse, and it takes days for a requisition, but I sped up the process. These are yours. How did you get this? Pop-tarts and real coffee. What? Check it out. June 12th. Eight years ago. Read. "Alan spoke on phone with Patricia Martin." Who's Patricia Martin? She's not mentioned in any other document. Keep reading. Per Alan, "Martin's testimony could clinch an indictment." "Intake interview 9:00 A.M. tomorrow." Well, where's the witness statement? Why didn't we get an indictment? I don't know, and I don't know. Something this big, there's got to be a follow-up. I checked... nothing in your jacket, but take a look at Alan's jacket. Oh, you got his, too? I also had hummus. Hmm. "Witness Patricia Martin failed to appear for interview." "Subsequent attempts to contact... unsuccessful." It seems this witness was about to blow the case wide open, and this is it? I need to speak to Ms. Martin. That's why you're in a park. She's meeting you here in 10 minutes. Thank you. It's like an anchor with a leather handle. I say... "return to sender!" Adorable. Thank you! Unless you happen to be me, the C.E.O. of Pacific Holdings. Oh. We demand that Ms. Barrett remove her offending blog and disgorge any profits she may have earned. Ms. Kritzer, there are no profits. And I'm not taking down the video. If you don't like it, sue me. No problem. Breach of implied contract. However, if you agree to remove your blog, we won't pursue legal action. Well, that sounds reasonable. No way! Unh-unh. This is America. And I am allowed to share my opinion whether you, Ms. C.E.O., like it or not. We will see you in court. I remember hearing about the murder when it happened. It was all over the news. It was tragic. Ms. Martin, you had information about the case. Yeah... I was in an A.A. meeting, and this guy stands up and tells the group he had a dream that he killed a girl. The details were so close to the real story. That's when I called the D.A.'s office. You mentioned a machete. That wasn't released to the press. No, but it was in his dream. Okay, do you remember the guy's name? Sure. It was Nathan persky. He kept talking about the machete and blood. He was crying. Uh, why didn't you show up for your meeting with Alan Roberts? What are you talking about? You set up a meeting, you never showed up or returned his calls. Eight years ago, I met with Mr. Roberts, and I told him everything I just told you. Alan Roberts knew Nate Persky killed that girl and he buried the case. Persky's father is one of the most influential men in L.A., so, before you go making allegations... Oh, no. I can prove it. Nate was the first guy interviewed eight years ago. He told the police Elena never showed up and he stayed home waiting for her the whole night. And his story checked out? Nate's dad confirmed the two of them were home alone. Nate lies, and his father swears to it. And Alan knew this wasn't true. He spoke to a witness who heard Nate confess. Alan did nothing! Some people build careers by prosecuting bad guys, others... by looking the other way. Well, I am going to do something. So, do I confront Alan? That'll give him time to circle the same wagons. If you're going after big game, you got to take it down with your first shot. Ms. Barrett, you're a model by profession, aren't you? Yes. - You get free things all the time, don't you? - It's true. At photo shoots, I often get to keep stuff. Once, I even got a Rolex. Wait... no... [Laughs] no. That was from an ex-boyfriend who left it at my house. Strike that from the record. The stuff you get for free... are you expected to provide any additional services? Nope. NSA... no strings attached. Your witness. You're not dumb, are you, Ms. Barrett? Is that a trick question? Merchandise from my client is not the same as gifts from a modeling shoot. The clothes, the jewelry, the sunglasses... they had strings. I don't think so. Next question. Exhibit 7, a letter to you accompanying a package of clothing from Pacific Holding. And I quote, "and remember, if you don't have anything nice to say," "don't say anything." Well, I wouldn't call those "strings." Your honor, this is an implied endorsement contract that Ms. Barrett breached when she badmouthed my client's products. I was just being honest. Pros and cons. Good and bad. Dolce & Gabbana! Enough. I'm recognizing the implicit contract. The injunction is granted. Ms. Barrett will return the free merchandise and take down her video blog at once. Is this the target you observed with subject X? That's the guy I saw with Kim. Yes. Name's Andrew Corwin, public interest attorney, 39 years old, 6'1", 190 pounds, married, drives a BMW 750i, recently treated for a hammertoe... Whoa, back up there, Sherlock. The hammertoe? Common affliction. Usually happens when you're older. No. After his weight. Married. Going on six years. Is that a problem? Not for me. Got a minute? Uh, I was just about to jump on a call. This won't take long. It's about Andrew Corwin. How do you know Andy? I think you should be aware, Kim... he's married. Are you spying on me? No. I'm... I just, uh... I'm looking out for you. I thought you should know. You think I don't? I'm not an idiot, Parker. And of all people, should you really be judging me? I'm not judging you. I'm... You're just looking out for me? Right. You walk into my office to tell me about my personal life? Who the hell do you think you are? I'm sorry. It won't happen again. It better not. Kim, we're over. Yeah. We've been over for months. It took a little longer for me. Thank you for coming in, Mr. Persky. Yeah, of course. It's just, I'm not really sure how I can be helpful. Oh. Well, I believe that you killed Elena Estrada. And we have a witness who will testify to your confession. I have an alibi. You were at home with your father. I don't think a jury will buy it. Mr. Persky... you've been living with the guilt for a long time. Why don't you just come clean with me? Nate? What the hell is going on here?! You can't be in here. - Like hell I can't! - Dad... - Don't you say another word! Alan! Who is she? "She" is with the D.A.'s office, so, if you could just step right... What do you think you're doing? I'm interrogating the primary suspect. Not without an attorney present. He was offered... Nate, you just keep your head. Shut up. God, shut up. Shut up. - Just leave me alone. - Nate... Dad... They have a witness, and... I can't lie anymore. Nate, just wait for the lawyers... I don't need a lawyer! I did it! - Oh, Nate, stop! - Okay, I did it. I killed Elena. I did it. Okay? I killed Elena. You want to explain yourself? You first. You had no right to bring Nate in without consulting me first. Patty Martin told you about Nate's confession. She knew about the machete... information we kept from the press. You ignored her, and you doctored your jacket. Patty Martin? Yeah, I just spoke with her yesterday. Did she also tell you that her uncle was a detective? She could have easily found out about the machete from him. Not to mention the fact that she was barely three months' sober at the time. I was supposed to believe her over Warren Persky? Alan... Bad time? What is it? Nathan's ready to sign. I figured you'd want to be a witness. Sign here. We're not finished. Not now. And here. Oh, my God. What? Forget everything I just said. Nathan Persky is innocent. Hey, thanks. Hey! This is a nice surprise. Hmm. Didn't think I was gonna see you until later tonight. Andy, um, you know how when we meet people, we always try to put our best foot forward, maybe I don't tell you that I color my hair... You exaggerate your net worth. Yeah, the things we do, huh? Yeah! Or maybe it slips your mind and you forget to tell me that you're married. Oh, God, l... l... I... I can explain that. Is the explanation something like... you're married? No. [ Stammers ] Aah! I hear from you again, I'm calling your wife. First, you say Nate's guilty and you get a confession. Now you want to let him go. What the hell is going on? Years ago, I was a victim in a slasher movie. Excuse me? I played a dead body. But my point is, I was killed with a hatchet. The makeup artist applied the gashes so they ran top right to bottom left. And when I asked why, he said, "because the actor who plays the killer is left-handed." Do you see where I'm going with this? Not really. Autopsy shows that Elena was slashed top right to bottom left, which means her killer was left-handed. And Nate Persky just signed his confession with his right hand. Okay. Now I'm caught up. But if Nate Persky didn't do it, how does he know all those details, and why would he go down for this? I don't know. I don't know. Goodbye, lip gloss. Goodbye, obsidian black riding boots with tungsten studs. Oh! Goodbye, Prada sunglasses. I think I'll miss you most of all. Oh, Fred, it's true. There is no such thing as a free lunch or a sparkly camisole. It is the end of an era. Not yet. You gotta see this. It's on YouTube. They want you back. Who does? Your followers. If Pacific Holdings can't handle the truth, then that's just too bad. Stacy tells it like it is, and we are, like, so much better for it. So, if you love Stacy and you hate, hate, hate Pacific Holdings, then take your latest purchase and "return to sender"! Oh! [ Laughs ] That's my catchphrase! She got 40,000 hits in 2 hours. Wow. Hello. Yes, she is. Grayson wants to see you in his office. Oh, well, that's never a good thing. Tell me about the night Elena was killed. Oh, I confessed. Isn't that enough? I need to hear the details... from you. That night, I was... really, really drunk. When you're very, very drunk, do you black out? Yeah. I was hiding in the pool house so my father wouldn't see me drinking. And the next thing I remember, I was standing over Elena's body on the lawn. How did you dispose of the body? Well, my dad came outside. He'd seen what I'd done... and he yelled at me to go inside. Then? Uh, he wrapped her body in a tarp and took her away. Do you actually remember killing Elena? I remember... ...hearing her screams. And I remember her hiding behind a giant palm tree. And I remember the machete... and... the slashing again and again. But it feels like a dream. Nate, I don't think you killed her. But you said... Are there windows in the pool house? Yeah. What difference does that make? From the window, can you see the giant palm? Yeah, that's right. How do you know? Nate, I don't think your father found you standing over the body. I think you saw him kill Elena. No. You were looking out that window. We know the killer is left-handed. There was only one other person at home with you that day, and he is left-handed. Isn't he? Oh, God. Oh, God. Ha! I returned everything. Why can't you just leave me alone? Ms. Barrett, look around. Do you see my attorney? No. Why? Your videos, the honest ones, seem to have had an ameliorative effect. How dare you?! Stacy, it's a good thing. Will someone please just tell me what's going on? Your followers know they can trust you. Sales numbers on items you love have been soaring. They want you to continue with your blog. Wow. Of course they do. Pamela started a campaign hating on your company. That's really why I'm here, isn't it? I can't deny that's a factor. Here's the offer. Your blog goes back up. You can say anything you want. - The good and the bad? - You bet. You'll be like our own in-house "consumer reports." We'll link to your blog, and your remarks will be entirely unfettered. It means... it means we have a deal. So, when Warren Persky provided Nate with an alibi eight years ago, he was actually protecting himself. Sick, right? A father doing that to his own son? So why did Persky kill the girl? Autopsy showed signs of an attempted sexual assault. And no one ever says no to Warren Persky. Except Elena Estrada. Hi. Jane, I need to talk to you for a minute. Sure. I was just leaving. What are you doing here? Nate's Persky's been released... and his dad arrested. Great. Thanks for the update. Jane... ...we had something. Maybe. A long time ago. And I think now we both know why I left eight years ago. I saw what you were capable of, and I didn't want to be a part of it. - It's not that simple. - Really? You ignored Patty's statement. I told you... she was not a credible witness. No. Regardless of the circumstances, you purposely didn't document the interview... a complete breach of fiduciary duties. Warren Persky never promised me anything. Oh. - Not overtly, but I... - But you told yourself that you could use his influence for the greater good. Yeah. Alan, you built your career by looking the other way. And if you don't hand in your resignation, I'll make sure the truth comes out. What? Oh. Excuse me. I have an important meeting. You can't be serious. And it is the father... you are sure? Yes. He's already been arrested. I'm just sorry it took so long. Only one thing I don't understand... if it wasn't the new evidence - that brought you to the father... - Mm-hmm? ...what was it? Um, I guess... this time, I saw the case through different eyes. Thank you for not giving up. Hi. I got your text. And I got your drink! What's the occasion? We're celebrating my new gig as an Internet sensation and your return to a high-paying job at the firm. Oh! Look who's here. Hi! What a nice surprise. Do you want to join us? Sorry, Bingum. On a mission to get drunk and get... "Drunker." He's officially over Kim, and I'm moving on from what's-her-face. You know, the girl who left me at the altar. Oh, yeah. Excuse us, ladies. Gotta go. Yeah. Are you okay? Mm-hmm. He's here two seconds, and he's already chatting up a hottie. He's healing. Yeah, I know. You know, it's just... a part of me always holds out hope, and so when the wedding didn't happen... ...I thought... Oh, God. Never mind. Excuse me. Hi. Um... You see that guy over there in the dark jacket? I'd like to buy him a Manhattan, splash of sprite, two cherries. And just tell him it's from someone in his past. You got it. Stacy, that's my drink with Grayson. I know! And no one else knows about it. What are you doing? Well, even if he does go home with that girl, at least he's thinking of you. Oh. That's terrible. I know. What are you gonna do, sue me? Come on. I've already been sued once... no big deal. And besides, I'm looking out for my bestie. Thanks. He looks so confused. Maybe it's a good thing. Keep his mind open to a world of possibilities. Stacy, you really think I'm one of those possibilities? Absolutely. I would bet on it. Okay. To possibilities. Thank you.
