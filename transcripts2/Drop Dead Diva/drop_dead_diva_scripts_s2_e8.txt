 ♪ JANE: Sea that aspiring modal there? That was ma, Deb, until the day I died. I thought I'd go straight to heaven, but there was a bit of a mix-up, and I woke up in someone else's body. So now I'm Jane, a super-busy lawyer with my very own assistant. I got a new life, a new wardrobe. The only people who know what's going on with me are my girlfriend, Stacy, and my guardian angel, Fred. I used to think everything happened for a reason. And, well, I sure hope I was right.

 [COMPUTER KEYS CLACKING] [ELECTRICITY POWERING DOWN] [HELLO STRANGER'S "BIG BOOTS" PLAYING] [SCREAMS] [GASPS] [SHUDDERS] It's not fair. I dreamt I had Larry King's baby and you get an entire dance number with Thunder From Down Under? It was such a nice dream until Hank the bailiff. Who's Hank the bailiff? Remember? He's the guy that Jane dated before I became Jane. Why was he in my sexy dream? Well, the hunky men represent the dance partners missing from your life. Your subconscious is telling you it is time to start dating again.

 Oh, you're good at this. I know. You need to start with Hank. What? No. Why can't I start with one of the Thunder From Down Unders? I'd pick Number 3. Jane. No, Hank is sweet and all, but we don't have anything. Did you give him a real shot? Sweetie, old Jane really liked him. So maybe you owe it to her to see if there are any sparks. Fine, I owe her. I'll pay her back with an expensive haircut. Mm. What if we threw a dinner party and you invited Hank? It’d be a date with a safety net. Oh, I'll marinate lamb chops. I saw this great recipe in Real Simple. You don't read Reel Simple. I do at the gyno. It was either that or a pamphlet about the uterus. All right, fine. I will ask him. Now, check this out. Whoa, ha-ha. An Ellie Tannen scarf. To wear at my meeting with Ellie Tannen. No way. She's looking for new lawyers. I feel that this scarf says: "I'm not a stodgy lawyer. I'm part of your tasteful tribe." [BOTH GIGGLE] Jane, you know Ellie is a total monster. I can handle monsters. Remember that Tic Tac shoot I did with a Komodo dragon? Well, this dragon's a thrower. Office supplies, lattes, stilettos. So I'll duck. I am going to get Ellie to like me. It's perfect. It means that if you can't do what she asks, just smile and nod, Thank you. Gotta go. Oh, um, one more thing. Ellie hates the word "no." So that means... I know what 'no' means. It means that if you can't do what she asks, just smile and nod, and say, "it won't be a problem." It won't be a problem. She's going to love you. I hope. ♪ Can you believe Angelina Jolie walks this very corridor every time she comes for a fitting with Ellie? And that matters to me because, ? Um... Because Angelina could trip, sue Ellie, and if Ellie were our client, we could make a fortune on a protracted, high-profile trial. Good thinking, Bingum. There she is. ♪ Mr. Parker, Ms. Bingum. I'm Hugo, Ellie's executive assistant. She's ready. Thank you. I need you to start without me. Why? What's going on? I'll be right in. I just need a moment. We know you're interviewing firms. Chase & Funk, Marmel & Fletcher. They're good, but Harrison & Parker has expertise in all areas of the law that are of interest to your business. Copyright... Hugo, is that my scarf? Yes. What have you done to my poor scarf? Do you have some head wound? ♪ JANE: No, um... I saw it like this in the window of Bloomie's. As I was saying... Call Bloomingdale's. Have them fire the window dresser. Oh, no, no. Ms. Tannen, I'm so sorry. I was wearing your beautiful scarf exactly like you. Then I thought being matchy-matchy might make you uncomfortable. How refreshing. A lawyer who cares about my feelings. Come, let's go to lunch. I have a pressing legal matter I want to discuss. So we're hired? Yes. But only she's coming to eat. ♪ [CHUCKLES] I don't know. I feel so stupid. We never even thought to make a will. It was a car accident. Unfortunately, Ms. Webb, this happens all the time. Have you filed with the probate court? Yes. Your in-laws are making the same claim? They want everything. They didn't even come to their daughter's funeral. Your spouse was their daughter? Yes, Melanie. You and your wife had a civil union? No, Ms. Kaswell. When we got married, I was a man. ♪ Please, can you help me? We'll do everything we can. ELLIE: Waiter. WAITER: Yes? More, please. That's enough. So here's why I asked you to lunch. My former assistant, Dawn Lucas, had the audacity to write a book about me. Wow. Did you read it? First two chapters. She sent it to publishers. Of course, there was a bidding war because of my name. We're done. Let me clear that, ma'am. I'm so... I just... Just a little. Um... So you fool that tho book is unflattering? She makes me out to be abusive. It's pure fiction. Legally, we have to wait until the book is released. But then we can sue for libel. I want you to stop the book before it's published. That's not how it works. Uh... The freedom of speech is the foundation of our country. If you can't help me, I'll ask the waiter to put your salmon dijonnaise in a doggy bag. So, Jane, can you stop the publication of this book or not? It won't be a problem. ♪ Ah. The prodigal lawyer returns. Oh. Were you waiting for me? What? No, I just had some business here in reception. What's Ellie got for us? She wants me to file an injunction to stop a tell-all from being published. Which would be prior restraint, and you'd lose. Yeah, I know. it's impossible. The government couldn't use prior restraint to stop the Pentagon Papers. As Justice Black said: 'To hold that the publication of news may be enjoined "would make a shambles of the First Amendment." Oh. Oh. Ha-ha-ha. I'd have a tough time arguing that a book is a threat to national security. Agreed. So, what do I do? If the law is against you, bang on the facts. If the facts are against you, bang on the law. If both are against you, bang on the table. That's a lot of banging. You have a fiduciary duty to your client. The relationship is sacred. Especially if the client handed you a big fat retainer. Bang, bang. ♪ Ready to meet our client's in-laws? I was thinking, do you need me? You seem to have it under control. Wow. You're that uncomfortable that you have to remove yourself? No. Okay, maybe a little. I mean, I completely respect his... Her... Her. Right. Look, the client needs an alpha male. If you can accept Allison, no one else should have a problem. You see me as an alpha male? [CHUCKLES] I see you as a prop in this case. If you're uncomfortable, keep your mouth shut. Mr. and Mrs. Walters, we're sorry for your loss. But we can come to a reasonable settlement. Oh, really? ls there a price that you can put on humiliation? We couldn't send out family Christmas cards or attend family reunions. You chose not to. You know how much that hurt Melanie? Melanie died without children. Without a will, the property goes to the spouse first, then to the parents. And Allison is the spouse. Spouse, please. Not under California Law. Look, Allison isn't trying to get rich here. She wants to stay in the home she shared with your daughter, keep her belongings... Everything that belonged to Melanie belongs to us. Taking away Melanie's things won't take away what we had together. ♪ She was everything to me. You did this to yourself. JANE: Hi, Stacy's voicemail. So I am at the courthouse, and I'm pretending to be talking to you, so that I look fake-busy when I fake-bump into Hank and invite him to our date-slash-fake dinner party. Um... Oh, there he is. Bye. Hank. Jane. How are you? Good, good. It's been a while. Yeah. Um... How have you been? Oh, you know, Shelby in Arraignments got transferred. Threw off everyone's schedule. Been total chaos. I bet. Yeah. Sol know that this is last-minute, um, but my roommate and I are throwing a dinner party tomorrow. Why don't you come? I'd love to. Oh, great. Around 7? I can't wait. Me too. Okay. Okay. ♪ Our first challenge: We have to survive their motion to dismiss... Ms. Tannen, are any of the allegations in the book true? You really expect to stop publication? Have you spoken with Dawn? No photo ops. No sound bites. Keep walking. Parker. Hi. I said I wanted her, not you. Oh, I'm just here to observe silently. Hmm. REPORTER: Ms. Tannen. Thought of a new cause of action yet? Maybe. I'm not sure. Dawn, how does it feel to be a hero for under appreciated assistants? REPORTER: What are you hoping to gain by publishing? I wanna tell my side of the story. She's hoping to get rich by telling lies. Just because you're the boss, doesn't mean you can treat people bad. Badly. it's an adverb. How can you write a book when you don't know grammar? Don't believe a word she says or writes. I move to dismiss Ms. Bingum's complaint. No court has countenanced prior restraint. Your Honor, he's right. Uh... Which is why we are suing for defamation. Defamation? Heh. JANE: Yes. The book's not even published. The book's written by an incompetent who couldn't make coffee. Quiet. And no sunglasses in my court. [WHISPERING] Take them off, take them off, take them off. Your Honor, Dawn Lucas sent the first two chapters to 20 publishers. As soon as any one of them read it, it was de facto published. Publication doesn't require that the book is sitting on the shelf at Barnes & Noble. Every person in Starbucks with a laptop is a published author? Once they press send, yes. An unorthodox argument, but the logic is sound. Motion to dismiss denied. I'll see you all tomorrow. [GAVEL BANGS] Nice. Might have a shot. You? Too much cologne. You smell like the back of a New York cab. And you. Tomorrow try not to whine. It's grating. I just got us a trial. Really? Bragging? Suddenly I'm nostalgic for the whining. Charming, isn't she? Do something about her. If her own lawyer doesn't like her, the jury's gonna hate her. TERI: Please answer the question. That's ridiculous. She was aloud chewer. I couldn't focus with the noise. I had to forbid her to eat anything crunchy or crispy. You're in contempt. Ellie, if you explode like that in court, you play right into their hands. So you need to act like the questions don't bother you. ♪ I'm waiting, counselor. Did you send Ms. Lucas to Nordstrom to remove a mannequin's clothing simply because it was displaying Donna Karan? Donna Karan is a glorified home-ec teacher. Okay, really, really close. A better response might have been: 'The clothes were out of season. I was helping Nordstrom stay current.” TERI: Maybe I can help. When I'm asked a question that pisses me off, I first smile, tilt my head to the left, and quietly think, "Bite me," before I answer. I do it every time my mother asks when I'm getting married. Okay. Let's try again. So I'm opposing counsel, and I'm going to ask... Is it true that you refused to allow Dawn Lucas to attend her grandmother's funeral? No. I merely told Dawn there was work to be done and if she wasn't at her desk, somebody else would do it. So you claim that this book is a misrepresentation? Yes. What about this? "Ellie took one look at my outfit and told me it needed to be burned" and that she would set it on fire whether I was wearing it or not. I went home to change outfits, "and she docked my pay while I was gone." Do you recall this incident? I do. You must understand that if my employees dress without taste that reflects badly on me. Why did you dock her pay? It was only fair to employees who were at work and dressed appropriately. Sounds reasonable. Not the work of a "tyrant" or a "rageaholic" or a "spiteful witch." Those are my air quotes, her words. Ms. Tannen, why would Ms. Lucas write such misrepresentations? People can be jealous. They don't realize it takes talent, hard work and personal sacrifice to achieve what I've achieved. When they can't cut it, they have to cut down those who do. ♪ Don't be nervous. You won't be on the stand long. Great. The less I see of the Walters, the better. I'll ask questions about your genetics, more specifically your DNA. Since your chromosomes are male, the court should... Absolutely not. I'm not a man. I won't say that I am. Uh... We don't mean to be offensive. But every relevant case has ruled against the transgendered person. The DNA argument gives us a chance to dodge that. I don't care what my DNA says. It's just a legal strategy. When I transitioned, Melanie stood by me every step of the way. Saying I'm a man denies everything that we went through. Please, find another way. ♪ [SIGHS] DAWN: I was so excited. The job was a dream come true. I've always loved fashion. For my 8th birthday, I asked my mom for a subscription to Vogue. My first day, I told Ellie that story. And what was her response? She told me to bore someone else. Ooh. That must have hurt. Yes. But I didn't wanna quit. So to let it all out, I started a journal. A friend who works in publishing read some of it and suggested I write a proposal. So you had no malicious intent? Objection. Counsel's putting big legal words in his little client's mouth. Why did you write the book? It was therapeutic. It's sad when your dream job doesn't live up to your dreams. Yes, it is. My client gave me a copy of your résumé that you submitted to get the job. I called the Fashion Institute. They don't have you on record. Oh, well, I audited. JANE: Who is Mitchell Hastings? DAWN: A friend. And he's also your literary agent? Yes. Mr. Hastings doesn't usually take on first-time authors, but you came to him with a great idea, didn't you? I have a lot of ideas. It's time to come clean, Dawn. Didn't you pitch that you would get a job with Ellie Tannen, work for her, and then write a tell-all? No. Really? Because your agent called publishers before you began working for Ellie to see if there was interest in a book. I don't know. Once the publishers gave the go-ahead, isn't that when you set out to land a job with Ellie? Objection. Badgering. JANE: Excuse me, Your Honor. I'll ask it again in a nicer, non-badgering voice. Isn't it true that you took this job under false pretenses, solely to write a tell-all and destroy Ellie Tannen? I, uh... l... Jane. Jane. What? I feel sick. I need a break. Take a Tums. Dawn's about to crumble. Please. I feel faint. Ten-minute recess. ELLIE: The last few weeks have been torture. The trial has been very draining. JANE: Excuse me. Excuse me. So it is with a heavy heart that I decided to drop the case. REPORTER 1: Dropping the case? REPORTER 2: Why? REPORTER 3: Were you wrong in portraying this? REPORTER 4: Why are you dropping it? There are no victors in a long court case. I just hope no one reeds that trash. STACY: Where are you? There is my hand. I'm trying to get to Ellie so that I can strangle her. You know, I've left her phone messages and e-mails, and she just won't respond. I don't understand what happened. You were dumped. On television. It's like The Bachelor without those gratuitous Jacuzzi scenes. But we know why Jason dumped Melissa. I have no idea why Ellie dumped me. [DOORBELL RINGS] It's Hank. Pull yourself together. You've got a date. Fred, dinner. Hank. I brought wine. And a... A date. ♪ This is my girlfriend, Jasmine. Heh. Hi. Hi. Come in. I'm sorry. Oh, my God. Hey, everyone. Hank brought wine and his girlfriend, Jasmine. Hi. [MOUTHING] Oh, my God. I'll get another plate. [MOANS] Come on. Oh... So, Jasmine, what do you do? I'm a court reporter. Hmm. Oh. Oftentimes in your court. JANE: Sorry. Of course. You are very good at your job. You type very fast. Jasmine, I have a question. Why do we need court reporters? Wouldn't it be easier to record everything? I mean, the technology has been with us for ages. So you don't think that my job is important? Um... I didn't say that. Okay. You're an assistant, so I'm guessing that you spend your days making coffee, xeroxing, taking crap. Now, that? That sounds important. [MIMICS PEE-WEE] Mecca lecca hi, mecca hiney ho. [IN NORMAL VOICE] Oh. What was that? It's Pee-wee. Ahem. I know you are, but what am I? I know you are, but what am I? BOTH: I know you are, but what am I? I know you are, but what am I? Infinity. JASMINE: Okay, Hank, honey. All right. [laughing] She does Pee-wee. She does. He does the Pee-wee thing when he gets nervous, or overly excited or turned on. ♪ He is so much fun. You never told me. Okay, who'd like more wine? Ahem. Yeah, a little less for you. [MIMICS PEE-WEE] Wine? She said the secret word. [HANK AND STACY SCREAM THEN LAUGH] He's with me, honey. Yeah. What? Oh. You think I'm flirting with him. No. Really? Because from here, it sure looks like it. No, no, you don't understand. Jane is supposed to be flirting with Hank. [coughs] JASMINE: What are..? What? Why? Why? Um... Never mind. No, no one flirts with Hank, ahem, except, uh, Hank's beautiful, fast-typing girlfriend, Jasmine. Oh, God. Was this supposed to be a date disguised as a dinner party? Well, see, that's my fault. Because, see, Jane had this dream about Hank... No. Shh. JASMINE: Okay. Oh, okay. Hank, we are leaving. You had a dream about me? Now, Hank. Okay. Honey. Honey. I'm so sorry. I know you are, but what am I? ♪ Good morning. Who says? Check out the story on HotStyles.net. I hate that fashion blog. They claimed the gladiator sandal was dead one day after I bought my new pair. The lead story is about Ellie. She just announced a discount line for the everyday woman. Ellie doesn't do discount. Read. Teri, cancel my morning. I gotta go. I thought you'd say that. KIM: Did you and Melanie file your tax returns jointly as a married couple? Yes. Did the IRS cash the checks you wrote? They most certainly did. Was Melanie listed as your spouse on your insurance? Yes. Were you under a family plan with your phone company? Yes. So without question, the government and multinational corporations recognized you and Melanie as a married couple? They did. Thank you. I'd like you to read from the California Family Coda, Section 300. "Marriage is a personal relation arising out of a civil contract between one man and one woman." Ms. Webb, what gender was Melanie? A woman. And what gender are you? A woman. Thank you. ♪ We can do better. ELLIE: What about the Italian silk? Company. Jane. You never wanted to win this case, did you? This whole lawsuit was one giant publicity stunt. You were fired. And I am working. I figured it out. Your discount clothing line is available November 8th, one week after Dawn Lucas' book is released. Really? I had no idea. You didn't wanna stop the book, you wanted to promote it. Hugo. Shoo. Look, moms wanna wear my line, but their daughters could careless. I'm not on the hot list for the everyday gal. But then Dawn wrote the book, and thanks to the lawsuit, I'm relevant again. But then you started to win in court. It looked like the book wasn't gonna be published, so I had to pull your plug. Wait a minute. So when you hired me, you didn't think I'd win. You picked me because you thought I was a loser? Darling, I didn't need a good lawyer. I needed someone I could push around. And you walked in, so desperate to be liked. Turns out you're too good of a lawyer. Guess I misjudged. Anything else? No. You've been perfectly clear. ♪ Walk with me. But Kim needs her apple peeled, cored and sliced. I feel so stupid, Fred. You have an IQ of 140. I can assure you, you are not... Ellie hired me because she thought I'd lose the case. Doesn't make sense. I got the client by being Deb, a complete pushover. And I got fired by being Jane, smart and persistent. This is good. So you're giving Jane some props. But you're underestimating Deb. How? We both ended up here because she hit the return button and it sent the entire universe into disarray. Deb was not a pushover. Well, I did have my moments. Mm-hm. And if I don't get to Kim with her apple, she's gonna have one of hers. Mm. What...? Well, she's not gonna miss one slice. ♪ Grayson. Hey. You only do origami when you are stressed or upset. Yeah. Wait, how did...? I've noticed. What's wrong? We're losing this case. It's not right. I've heard. I didn't realize you felt so strongly. Well, it took me a while, but I realized it's only about one thing. Winning the case? No. It goes way beyond that. It's about something everyone searches for but only some of us find. Oh, like the perfect black cocktail dress. Yes. No, it's true love. I know. Yeah. You're absolutely right. What these two went through, and they stayed together, it makes you believe that love can conquer all. And nobody should be able to take that away from them. I agree. Grayson, in Littleton v. Prange, wasn't Littleton's marriage invalidated because she was male on her birth certificate and couldn't marry another male? Yeah, it's not helpful. Actually, it might be. Littleton held that legally, gender is determined by which box is marked on the birth certificate, right? But Allison won't let us argue that she's a man. You don't have to. Apply the logic of Littleton. If the birth certificate is controlling, your client was legally married. Win-win. The state used the birth certificate to destroy a marriage. You can use it to validate one. I'll give it a shot. Thanks, Jane. Well, anything for true love. Yeah. [FIRST AID KIT'S "HARD BELIEVER" PLAYING] I'm sorry. Pomtini? Thanks. Wow. You must be really sorry. Mm-hm. I have learned my lesson. Sometimes a dream about Thunder From Down Under and Hank is just a dream about Thunder From Down Under and Hank. You know what? You were trying to be helpful. Hope I didn't mess things up for Hank. I ran into him at court. He said it was the best night of his life. Go Hank. [DOORBELL RINGS] You expecting someone? No. ♪ it's Ellie. No. Oh, my God, I'm wearing sweats. No, don't leave me. [WHIMPERS THEN CLEARS THROAT] JANE: Ms. Tannen. I need to speak with you in private. Pretend I'm not here. Okay. I just need to go to my room, Ahem. And change out of these sweats that are so last season. Yes, please, make yourself at home. I've changed my mind. I wanna go back to court and stop publication of this book. Really? Did you have something else you wanted to promote? I'm done, Ellie. You're on retainer. You still work for me. Retainer or not, I have one word for you: No. Hugo got a copy of the book. There are things I don't want the world to know. Like what? Does it matter? Yeah, if you want my help. Jane, I'm going blind. I have a degenerative eye disease, Steingardt's syndrome. Hugo helps me pick out the fabrics and the colors. But the concepts and designs are all mine. I have no idea how Dawn found out. So your glasses... Let them think that I wear them to hide my thoughts. The truth is, my eyes are painfully sensitive to light. Okay. If you don't help me, my career will be over. I need you. I thought she dropped this and now she wants a closed courtroom? Is this one of your stunts? If this were a stunt, I'd be inviting TMZ into the gallery. The information I intend to introduce is of a sensitive, personal nature. Mr. Resnick, this case was not officially dismissed, and I don't have a problem excusing the jury or the public. I could use the quiet. Your Honor, at this point, we recall Dawn Lucas to the stand. Ms. Lucas, in the final chapter of your manuscript, you reveal my client's health issues, true? Yes. My publisher is very excited. JANE: I'm sure. So how did you learn about Ms. Tannen's medical problems? Oh. I was her assistant. I heard things around the office. But Ms. Tannen never spoke of her condition at the office. I would like to submit Exhibit A. Release forms signed by Ms. Tannen to obtain her private medical records. Only the signature is not Ms. Tannen's. It's a forgery. Objection. No foundation. I have a handwriting expert to verify that Lucas forged my client's signature. I have a receptionist from the hospital that will testify that Lucas picked up those tiles. If the DA wants to prosecute for forgery, that's his decision. But as far as this case is concerned, she has not shown falsity. Maybe so. But public disclosure of private facts is actionable, so I'm amending my complaint. Public disclosure doesn't apply because Ms. Tannen is a public figure. She doesn't enjoy the same right to privacy as us common folk. He's right, Your Honor. Ms. Tannen is a public figure. And people love juicy gossip about public figures. Totally guilty. However, with these new chapters, Dawn Lucas crossed the line. Just because something is true, does not give you the right to publish it. Famous people, nasty people or famously nasty people still have some rights to privacy. Now, you can hate Ms. Tannen, but that does not give you the right to destroy her. There is a genuinely mean woman in this room, but it is not my client. Allison Webb was a devoted spouse and committed partner. Yet we're deciding whether to strip her of her title to her partner's possessions. And why? Because we don't know what to call her. You've asked for law. Well, the majesty of the law is that we apply its principles to everyone. In Littleton v. Prange, a Texas court denied Christie Littleton benefits because her birth certificate listed her as male, and she was married to a man. Our point exactly. The court held they were a same-sex couple. Although my client is a woman, her birth certificate says male. By the logic of Littleton, she qualifies under Section 300 as a spouse. That's not the ruling. But it is the logic. Precedent or no, it's persuasive. Texas law has no precedential value here. That's for me to decide. I'm finding for Ms. Webb. What? Should you appeal, it's my hope you get another judge who believes it's not our job to judge whether two people can be in love. Thank you. There's little question that I cannot stop the publication of Ms. Lucas' book. I'm so sorry. While I'm denying injunctive relief, I do find the work does publicly disclose private facts, and therefore, I'm awarding damages for each disclosure, $28 a book. But the book sells for $27. If the publisher loses a dollar a copy, why would they sell my book? My guess, they won't. [CHUCKLES] Fine. I can write articles. I've been offered a speaking tour. Plenty of people will pay me for this information. JUDGE: I'd be careful if I were you. I assume Ms. Bingum has yet to inform the DA of the forgery? Not yet, Your Honor. But if Ms. Lucas acts on her threats, I most certainly will. Oh, and being the fashion expert that you are, I'm sure you know, orange prison jumpsuits, not that flattering. JUDGE: That's all, people. We're adjourned. [GAVEL BANGS] I can't thank you enough. it's just beyond... Excuse me. Oh, Mr. Walters, can we help you? I'd like to speak with Allison. Please. it'll only take a minute. Okay. My wife and I, we never saw eye to eye on... ♪ I wish Melanie would have known that. I can never forgive myself for turning my back on my daughter. Now I'll never see her again. Thank you for making her happy. This was my mother's. I wanted to give it to Melanie. But I want you to have it, if you would. I'll never take it off. It goes with everything. You can't just barge in here. I just did, didn't I? Jane, Ms. Tannen to see you. You have another case for me? Please, no. Court is so drab. All they need to do is change the lighting. I mean, is that so hard? Jane, I never care what people think about me. Let them call me mean or dragon lady or... Cruellie De Vil? Ha-ha-ha. I was just saying. My point is, I care what you think. Oh. Well, I think that you don't need to be so mean to sell clothes or run a fashion house. I'm not saying be a pushover, but there is a... Stop talking. See, that was a little mean. So I can give you this. Oh. Well, maybe not so mean. It's gorgeous. It's one of a kind, just like me.. Toodles. ♪ [GIGGLES] Hey. Congrats. I just heard. Oh. Kudos to you as well. Well, I couldn't have done it without your help. Here, I brought you this. Thanks. [CHUCKLES] You know, I'm happy for Allison. Love conquered all. You really believe in that, don't you? Allison became a woman, and Melanie still loved her. Their connection transcended their physical bodies. It's the definition of soul mates. Yeah. Um... Grayson, there's something that I've wanted to tell you, and maybe, finally, now is the right time. Okay. Um... Oh, it's a little harder than I thought it was gonna be. [CHUCKLES] See, I'm not... FRED: Jane. I need you. Right now. it's an emergency. JANE: Okay. It's kind of private. Okay. Yeah, no problem. I will talk to you tomorrow. Sure. What are you doing? That was perfect. I was finally gonna tell him that I'm Deb and... Which is why you showed up. It's my job. You can't tell anybody, especially Grayson. Grayson believes love conquers all, so that means there's a chance... Jane, I'm not saying that you and Grayson aren't soul mates. But he has to fall in love with you. Not because you tell him you're Deb, but because he loves you as you are now. But what if...? Hey. Do you believe that love conquers all? I want to. I really do.
