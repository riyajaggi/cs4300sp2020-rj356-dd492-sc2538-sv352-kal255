 Drop Dead Diva (2009–2014): Season 3, Episode 1 - Hit and Run - full transcript 
 Following the car accident that left Grayson in a coma, Jane finds herself struggling with her desire to reveal herself as Deb when he wakes up, despite warnings from Fred. Jane reluctantly takes on a case involving a hard partying celebrity on the hook for a hit and run of a 12-year-old girl and enlists Stacy to help her. Meanwhile, Parker and Kim face off in court representing opposing sides of a case involving exes which rings a little too close to home for them.

 You died, went to Heaven, pressed a button, and they turned you into a size 16?! Pretty much. That is so unfair. Previously on "Drop Dead Diva"... - Hey. - Hey. Stacy: You're not telling Grayson? I'm Jane now. He loved Deb. Do you believe that love conquers all? I want to.

 Let him fall in love with you. Vanessa Hemmings with Dewey & Pierce. Jane: He looks at her the same way he used to look at me. Well, Deb. Mm, the way we look at pizza after swim aerobics. Yeah. ♪ And I don't know why ♪ ♪ I'm just a little girl lost in the moment ♪ Ooh. ♪ I'm so scared ♪ ♪ I've got to let it go ♪ Any chance I had with Grayson is gone. But you know those office romances never work out, right? No good-night kiss, or you only do that at the office? You can't make him love you by telling him that you're Deb.

 - Stacy, I'm gonna tell him. - Oh, my God. - I've got something important to tell you. - I have something important to tell you. Jane, will you... ...be my best man? No. What? Jane! [ tires screech ] Grayson! Please, Grayson. Please. Deb? Drop Dead Diva 3x01 - Hit and Run Original air date June 19, 2011 Sync and corrected by atrn97g www.addic7ed.com Excuse me. Hi.

Grayson! I died, but when I went upstairs, I pressed the return button, and now I'm back in this body. [ chuckles ] And, Jane, I know you're really Deb. Oh, my God. [ laughs ] Grayson. - Hey, Jane. - Oh, not now, sir. But it's me... Grayson. I died, but when I went upstairs... Young man: Yo, Jane! Baby, it's me... Grayson. I died, but when I went upstairs... - Jane? I... it's me. - Jane, it's me. Jane, it's me... Grayson. Jane! It's really me. [ monitor beeping ] Ma'am, are you okay? You were talking in your sleep. Oh. Oh, I'm fine. [ chuckles ] How's he doing? Any change? No, nothing yet.

Jane! - Are you okay? - Yeah. I just had that same dream, except for this time it was disco instead of reggae. [ both chuckle ] Oh, sweetie, I'm sure he's gonna wake up real soon. Yeah. And then what? "And then what", what? Stacy, after he was hit by the car, he looked directly at me and called me "Deb." [ cellphone buzzing ] I mean, when he wakes up again, who's he gonna see... Jane or Deb? - Fred. - No. He's calling. - Hey. - How's he doing? - About the same. - I miss you. I just saw you like an hour ago. I don't know what I'd do if you were hit by a car. Promise me you'll always look left, right, and then left again...? I promise. And... Fred? - Yeah? - I miss you, too. Hey, uh, can I talk to Jane? He wants to talk to you. Um, she's... busy. [ sighs ] Oh. I got to go. Can I help you? I'm looking for Kim Kaswell. I regret to inform you that Ms. Kaswell is no longer with us. Oh, I'm so sorry. Yeah, it's sad, but she's in a better place. Oh, my God. Lady, she's fine. She just quit the firm. What is wrong with you? Uh, you know what? This is Ms. Kaswell's new address. Thank you. So, I'm confused, Freddy. With Kim gone, why are you still on her desk? Free coffee, free office supplies, and I am building a plantation on "Farmville." Why would I leave? [ Parker clears throat ] Jane: - Parker! - I just saw the doctor. Said he could wake up anytime. Yeah. We're just... waiting. Can I talk to you out here? Go. Look, it's been three days. It's time to get back to work. Fine, but at the moment, I don't have any clients. Oh, potentially, you have a whale. That is highly insensitive. Maybe the client has a thyroid problem. Oh, no. Sweetie, a "whale" is what we call a wealthy client. Tim Kline just fired his lawyer on the morning of his trial. Oh, my God. Tim Kline, the movie star, is your whale? - Potentially. - Oh, he's charged with a hit and run... ...12-year-old girl. - She's in bad shape. - Yep. Jane, you're gonna meet him in an hour. - No. - Poolside at the Waverly? It's where he takes all of his meetings. It's also where he trashed his hotel room, made a sex tape, and drunk twittered about his affair. - I don't want the case. - Ah-ta-ta-ta-ta! Are you crazy?! He only fired his attorney because he wants to delay the trial until he can finish shooting "Bad Blood 3." And besides, I think he's guilty. Well, sure, his Ferrari was found dumped off Mulholland the morning after the accident, and he doesn't have an alibi, but every movie star deserves fair representation. It's in the bill of rights. Jane, you're going to that meeting. We both are! Oh, no! Be honest... can you see the pimple on my nose? I know it's there. I can feel it. I cannot meet Tim Kline with a zit. I don't see anything. [ chuckles ] - Okay. - Even if I was going, I'm sorry, but I can't bring a friend. No, but you can bring an intern... [ gasps ] - ...unpaid. - Oh. She knows all the details. She can keep you focused. My yoga instructor says I'm so focused, that sometimes it's like there's nothing in my head. I told Vanessa that I would stay with Grayson until she got back, so... - Hey, Vanessa. Vanessa: - Hi. Jane, thank you for staying with him. Oh, of course. If you need me to stick around, I'm not... Oh, no, we'll be fine. [ chuckles ] Okay. Well, let's go meet the whale. [ keys clacking ] Kim. Penny. Hi. You're working in a coffee shop? Yeah. It's a temporary situation. How are you? Oh, I'm great. Fine. [ sighs ] Not so good. Oh. Well, have a seat. What's going on? You remember Kevin? Yeah, your cheating ex-husband? We got him pretty good in the divorce. A few weeks ago, he called and said he'd been to therapy, and that he was a changed man. Okay. I invited him over for dinner, and one thing led to another... You slept with him. And then I never heard from him again. Jackass. Yeah. Well, how can I help? I want to sue him. For what? For... a booty call? Can I do that? Actually, I think you can. I'll work up a cause of action, file a complaint, and he'll be served by noon. Great. Oh, there's one more thing. I... I heard you and Parker broke up. It's for the best. I'm thinking Kevin will hire Parker to be his lawyer, they're friends from the club. Will that be a problem? Not for me. Good. Thanks. You get to go to the Waverly in the middle of the day with an expense account. You have the coolest job ever! I know, right? Ooh! Eye candy, 6:00. Miss Bingum? Yes. Hi, I'm Mark, Tim's manager. Hello. And his brother, four years older. - A virgo. - That's right. And you are? Miss Bingum's intern, Stacy. Pleasure to meet both of you. Tim's waiting in a bungalow. Great. I know how it looks... ...me firing my lawyer at the 11th hour. But what can I say? The guy's incompetent. Why wait till the day of the trial? Because he promised this day would never come. He said the charges were gonna be dismissed. You are looking at 10 years in jail. Have you considered a plea? No. Because I'm innocent. Someone stole my car and hit that girl, okay? I was home alone the whole night. I swear. I totally believe you. The thing is, I don't know if I believe you. Well, then, we appreciate your candor, but... We're done here. No, no, no, no, wait! Jane is a great lawyer. She's won awards. I mean, nothing like your people's choice, but real lawyer awards. Say something. If I don't believe you, good luck with a jury. Tim. Tim Kline. I'm Jason Hendler with "Extra." Hey. Hey! It's not a good time right now. I'm sorry to bother you, but is it true you fired your attorney this morning? Yes, it is. Is it a delay tactic so you can finish filming your movie? No, I, um... ...it's not... it's not that uncommon. - Please, please, please? - It's fairly common. This is... this is... Excuse me, Mr. "Extra Extra", but to blind-side Mr. Kline just when his jury is being impaneled compromises his right to a fair trial. Do you, sir, really want to stand in the way of justice? Who are you? Her name's Jane Bingum. And she's my new lawyer. ..."but to blind-side Mr. Kline just when his jury is being impaneled" "compromises his right to a fair trial". "Do you, sir, really want to stand in the way of justice?" That's good, Stacy. If they remake "Erin Brockovich", I am so ready. [ laughs ] Jason: - Who are you? - Her name is Jane Bingum, and she's my new lawyer. Bad boy Tim Kline has had a rough year. First, accusations of infidelity with his pilates instructor. Then his wife, Lana, files for divorce after three years of marriage. [ TV shuts off ] Police reports, crime-scene photos, deposition transcripts. And the clerk called. The judge denied your petition for a continuance. Said she won't delay the trial so your client can finish the movie. - But I'm not ready. - Then we better get to work. Ms. Kaswell. It's nice to have you back. I'm here about the settlement conference you requested. I've left you a dozen messages. I apologize for kissing Claire, it meant nothing to me. I'm not here about us. Kim... Parker, the case. [ inhales deeply ] Fine. Your complaint has no merit. You can't sue for a booty call gone bad. Three causes of action... civil battery, negligent infliction of emotional distress, and general sexual misconduct. I don't even understand that last one. I wouldn't expect you to. Okay. We're seeking an order to dismiss. Then why did you even call this meeting? To see you. And if a settlement conference was the only way I could get through to you... We're done. I'll see you in court. Detective: Based on skid marks and the initial impact, I concluded that Amy Robinson was struck by a southbound car on Beverly Glen at approximately 8:15 PM. And you found this vehicle, a Ferrari 599, the following morning? Yes, at the base of Laurel Canyon. Registered to Tim Kline. We believe it was pushed off of Mulholland Drive in an attempt to hide it from authorities. Are you certain it was the defendant's car that struck Amy? Yes... hair, fiber, and blood on the car's grille - are consistent with the victim. - Thank you. Detective, did anyone see my client hit Amy Robinson? - No. - Is it conceivable that someone stole Tim's car, and the person who stole the car hit Amy Robinson? There's no evidence there was another driver. Detective, I'd like to call your attention to my intern's nose. Ms. Barrett, please wave to the detective. Stacy! She appears to have flawless skin, doesn't she? I guess. She actually has a pimple on her nose. It's barely noticeable. You said it wasn't noticeable. - Your Honor? - Counselor, what are you doing? I'm trying to remind the jury that the absence of evidence isn't evidence of absence. In other words, just because you can't see something doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Like Miss Barrett's pimple. Detective, just because you didn't find evidence that someone else was driving Tim's car doesn't mean that someone else wasn't, in fact, driving Tim's car, correct? I suppose that's true, but... No more questions. In Askew v. Askew, the court ruled, "The judiciary should not attempt" "to regulate the human condition." "Relationships beget complications" "which defy reason." That is why we're asking you to dismiss. This case is factually distinct. As a divorced couple, they had a special relationship, not unlike two co-workers, for instance. Your point is? Mr. Brecker should have known exactly how his behavior would have harmed my client. And she should have known what to expect. It's a double-edged sword. I agree. This case has no merit. But... hold on, your Honor. Kevin specifically told Penny that he had changed. Given his material misrepresentation that he was no longer a skirt-chasing dirt bag, we would like to amend our complaint... ...to include false advertising. - What? No! I object! - Of course you do. My client relied on how her husband advertised himself... that he had gone to therapy and was a changed man. She was duped. Your honor, she's making a mockery of your court. I don't disagree. False advertising claims should be brought before a commercial arbitrator, and that's where I'm remanding this case. In fact, my sister was just appointed. She'll hear testimony tomorrow morning. [ gavel bangs ] Jane: - Stacy. - Hi! What are you doing here? I heard from Teri that we're briefing our client here. Oh, no, no. It's just a meeting. It's not a briefing. Oh, and I brought sunscreen and bathing suits, in case we have time for a siesta. Sweetie, I'm sorry, but you shouldn't be here. Oh, come on. Hey, Tim. Hi, Mark. Hey. So sorry we're late. - We should get started. - Yes, we should. - I'm so excited! - I know. Walk. Walk. Jane: Well, we made some headway. But without an alibi, we're in trouble. Tim, did anyone have access to your car? Friends or employees? It's a $200,000 car. Everyone knows it's my favorite. No one drives it but me. - What about you, Mark? - Excuse me? According to "People" magazine, you live in Tim's guesthouse and have a taste for expensive cars. I loved his Ferrari, but I never drove it. Oh, we have company. Miss Bingum, can we talk? If you're here to offer a deal, don't waste our time. My client is innocent. Amy Robinson died an hour ago. The indictment will be amended to second-degree murder. [ sighs ] Good morning, sunshine. Paula Abdul? Mm. I love your Egyptian cotton sheets. Let me guess... it's, um, 800 thread count? - Um, 1,000. - Mm. Oh, and this pillowcase is silk. [ laughs ] I have a great idea! Blueberry pancakes for breakfast? Okay, but why are you in my bed? Really? After last night? - What?! - Just kidding! But really, Jane, the reason I'm here is because I think it's time we had one of our talks. Okay. Thank you, but I know what you're gonna say. I am smart, I'm healthy, and I have gorgeous hair. [ laughs ] And I can do whatever I want with my life. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I'm practically superwoman. [ laughs ] I was gonna say, "You need to grow up, Jane". What? You've been pining after Grayson for so long... No, he opened his eyes and said "Deb." He knows it's me. [ laughs ] The poor guy's in a coma! His fiancée is by his side. The only thing you need to be is a supportive friend, nothing more. [ grunts ] Aah! [ exhales sharply ] Oh, she's right, Jane. I'm just saying, Paula Abdul makes an excellent point. Really? Two against one? Seriously, Fred, out of my bed. Not until you close your eyes. What? Why? Because it's time to wake up. Mm. Wake up! [ gasps ] We're due in court in half an hour. Okay. I just had the craziest dream. Ouch! Why did you do that? I just wanted to make sure I wasn't still dreaming. Well, you're supposed to pinch yourself. But I bruise more easily than you do. So true. Now, up and at 'em. - Stacy... - Hmm? When Grayson finally opens his eyes, I want him to know that it's me... Deb... not Jane. Is that so wrong? There is nothing wrong with hoping. But if he opens his eyes and he doesn't know it's you... Then I need to be a supportive friend, nothing more? Exactly. Now, sweetie, we have to get to work. Now, let me be perfectly clear. My brother only kicked me this case because I missed out on his last birthday. Ms. Kaswell, cutting through the legalese, you're suing today because of a booty call. Is that correct? A booty call caused by false advertising. Mm-hmm. Now, the only issue of law is whether Mr. Brecker falsely represented that he was a changed man in order to convince his ex-wife to have sex with him. Now, Mr. Brecker, it says here that you told your ex-wife that you're seeing a psychiatrist? - Yes, that's true. - Perfect. Have the doctor here later this afternoon to testify. Testify? Testify to what? To testify that your client is a changed man. Judge: Under the law, Amy Robinson's death is a direct result of being hit by the car. In other words, although she passed away last night, under the law 's as if she died at the time of impact. My wife's here. - She's your next witness. - What? She's my alibi. Okay, but I thought you said... Look, I wasn't sure if she was coming, but she's here now. Please, trust me. Miss Bingum, please call your next witness. Okay. Um... The defense calls... Lana Kline. Ms. Kline, what is your relationship to my client? I'm his wife, soon to be ex-wife. Papers are just being finalized. I see. Ms. Kline, on the night of the tragic accident, can you account for my client's whereabouts? Yes, I can. Objection. Miss Bingum did not file notice of an alibi witness. I would have, if I'd been granted the continuance and had more time. I'm usually much better prepared. Overruled. You'll have time to cross. Miss Kline, continue. The night of the accident, I was at Tim's house. Why was that? I own "The Dancing Horse". It's an antique figurine. It fell off a shelf, so I sent it out for repair. The shop still had Tim's address on file, so they sent it to his house. - So you went to pick it up? - Yes. I even brought the box with the mailing slip so you can see that it's the same date of the accident. Your honor, I would like to submit this box marked as defense exhibit "A". Please continue. When I got to Tim's house, he was asleep on the sofa. I saw that "Planet Earth" was playing on his giant TV, so I started to watch. I was there from around 7:00 to 10:00 PM... - And Tim was on the sofa the entire time? - Yes. And I'm guessing he was passed out from a few too many beers, but that's just a guess. [ clears throat ] - An educated guess. - Thank you. Are you aware that Tim was first charged with this crime - over a month ago? - Yes. Why didn't you say anything earlier? Because I'm angry at Tim. He embarrassed me in the press. Look, it might not have been the right thing to do, but I wanted to see him sweat. Is it true that you've been locked in a bitter divorce dispute over the past few months? Yes. The sticking point is the house in Aspen. You both want it. You said that your divorce paperwork is being finalized. Did the defendant agree to give you the house in Aspen within the last 24 hours? Yes. Was the house a bribe for your testimony today? No! So it's just a coincidence that after he agreed to give you a $5 million piece of property, you suddenly agreed to testify on his behalf. Are you aware of the penalties for perjury, Miss Kline? - Objection! - No more questions. I need a recess. I'm sure you do. Court adjourned. Don't say anything. Just listen. You ran over a 12-year-old little girl, and then you bribed your wife to commit perjury. - No! - And I can only assume that your prior counsel heard about your deal with Lana and withdrew from the case because they didn't want to participate in perjury. Would you just listen to me? Lana called me up. She told me about "The Dancing Horse". She just wouldn't testify unless I gave her the place in Aspen. Even if that's the case, the jury's not buying it. Well, it's the truth. She just wanted something for it. Tim, by any chance, could your brother have been driving the car? No. It could give us reasonable doubt if I could just suggest to the jury... Stop, stop. Mark has looked out for me my entire life, and I refuse to accuse him of anything he did not do. Find another way. Dr. Liddel, how long have you been Kevin's psychiatrist? About six months... ever since his divorce. Mr. Parker, you're up. Dr. Liddel, one week before the alleged incident, Kevin told you he no longer needed your services. Why was that? He said he was all better. "All better"? Kevin said he understood that he treated women poorly, probably a result of a dysfunctional relationship with his mother, and that he would modify his behavior accordingly. It's in my notes. Thank you. May I see your notes? I'm sorry, doctor/patient privilege. - I don't think so. - Excuse me? Well, given the circumstances, the privilege is waived. To be honest, counselor, when I first got this case, I thought it was a joke. But if Dr. Liddel is really able to train men to treat women better, I'm intrigued. Kim: Doctor, have you heard the expression "The more things change, the more they stay the same"? Dr. Liddel: Of course. Two weeks before the booty call with my client, your patient went to a bar and had sex with a woman. Now, according to your notes, he referred to her as a "Three-Beer Betty." What exactly does that mean? It means he needed to drink three beers before he could find her attractive enough to engage in intercourse. Does that sound like a changed man to you? He told me he had changed, and that's what I just told you. But in my expert opinion, he had not. He had not...? Changed. Ah. Thank you. [ Kim clears throat ] [ monitor beeping ] You can talk to him. [ chuckles ] I'm Dr. Kendal, his neurologist. - Hi. I'm Jane. - Hi. His, uh... his fiancée, right? Oh, no. Oh, I'm sorry. I just, um, I... I heard he was engaged. I just assumed. Oh, that's okay. Yeah, we're just friends. Well, there's anecdotal evidence that's helpful to speak to coma victims. Really? Well, what should I talk about? Anything you want. If it doesn't help him, maybe it'll help you. Okay. [ laughs ] So what do I say to the man that I love who doesn't know who I really am? Well, I could tell you that Kim left the firm and I snagged a good chair. Or I could go on about my new case, I'm representing Tim Kline, the movie star. But I'd much rather tell you how much I miss you... ...and how much I miss us. And I really do want you to be happy. [ voice breaking ] But watching you with Vanessa is killing me. And I can't believe I just said that out loud. [ chuckles, sniffles ] I know in saying this might make me the worst person in the world, but Vanessa is not your soul mate. I'm your soul mate. I'm Deb. [ sniffles ] This is kind of crazy talking to you like this. Grayson, did you just move? [ laughs ] Can you hear me? What happened? Um... [chuckles] you were in an accident. But you're okay now. [ exhales sharply ] Hi. [ chuckles ] Who are you? Grayson's suffering from retrograde amnesia. It's not uncommon in trauma victims. But it is temporary, right? Most likely. Next few days are crucial. How is his condition, otherwise? Well, given the circumstances, he's a lucky man. A few fractured ribs, some bad bruises. So, he can go home? We're gonna keep him here for observation, but probably in a day or two, yes. [ sighs ] Thank you. [ laughs ] Thank you so much. Ah. Your honor, I'd like the opportunity to call a character witness to testify that my client truly has changed. We're done, counselor. I think I've heard enough. And if either one of you want to appeal my decision, my brother, who just walked in... he's right behind you... will hear your case. In the meantime, I'm ruling That Kevin Brecker engaged in false advertising with the express purpose of convincing the plaintiff to engage in sexual intercourse. Will the defendant rise? Ms. Brecker, can you read this for us? "Watch out for Kevin Brecker". "Warning, ladies... dating this man could be damaging" "to your mental health and emotional well-being". I'm confused. What are you asking of my client? Well, I'm ordering Mr. Brecker to purchase a billboard on the Sunset Strip, and I want it to look and read exactly like this. [ Kim and Penny laugh ] Best verdict ever. Fred: Jane, you got a minute? [ sighs ] [ sighs ] I'm your guardian angel. You need to talk to me. [ chuckles ] Why are you mad at me? Is that a serious question? You let Grayson get hit by a car. He almost died. No, no, this is not my fault. I told you not to go to that dinner. I begged you not to intervene in his and Vanessa's relationship. Are you saying this is my fault? No. You didn't tell me what was gonna happen. Because I didn't know, Jane! I can't see into the future. All I know is that there's some rules that we all have to follow, and you refuse to believe that they apply to you. And now you're trying to blame me. Fred, you are my guardian angel. Yes! Good. You understand. I'm here to help you. Well, you can help me by closing the door on the way out of my office. What do you think you're doing? Helping Jane with her case. I'm studying the evidence. Jane's been through that box like a million times. - I'm another set of eyes. - I don't think so. Look, it isn't going well, and if there's a chance I could assist... But I get it. You think I'm just a dumb blonde who wouldn't possibly be useful. And you're expecting an argument? You know, right now, your boss needs our support. If anything, you should be encouraging me. Really? Like what, a cheer? [ gasps ] Oh, my God. That's a great idea. [ clears throat ] Maybe something like... Clap, clap, stomp, stomp, yeah! There's something seriously wrong with you. Nope. I just had a physical. How's it going in here? Fred! Stacy! - You're short! - You're mean. - I mean you're short! - I am not short. You just have really long legs and insist on wearing heels. I'm not insulting you. I just realized something. Okay, look at this photo. The driver's seat is close to the dash. It's like how you move the seat when you get into my car. So you're saying whoever drove it is short. Yes! But Tim is over 6'. Maybe the tow yard moved the seat when they brought it to the lot. Maybe they didn't. If the crash down Mulholland caused the seat motor to break, it would have locked into the last position it was in. It's true of all cars produced since 1995. Oh. [ laughs ] - That was exactly what I was thinking. - We should go to the tow yard. Yes, we should. [ giggles ] Clap, clap, stomp, stomp, yeah! Oh, excuse me. Mark. What are you doing here? Miss Bingum, I want to confess. I was driving the car... ...and I killed that girl. I'm confused. Why are we here if Mark confessed? Because I can't represent him, and a new attorney could convince him to change his story. Ah, and you want to make it stick. Exactly. Here is the car. Okay. - Ms. Stacy, please take a seat. - Ooh. Well, thank you so much. Wow. Okay, I'm 5'8", and there is no way I could drive this car in this position. And Mark is shorter than me. Check the seat motor. Is it broken? [ buzzing ] Yes, it is. Perfect. So even without Mark's confession, this should be enough for reasonable doubt. - You're the best intern ever. - I try. [ both chuckle ] Ooh, don't move. You got something on the back of your thigh. Aah! Oh, my God. Is it a spider? I know it's not very Zen. Just kill it! Just kill it! It's not a spider. - Stacy. - Yes? I don't think Mark was driving that car. But I know who was. Lana, would you mind standing up so my intern can measure you? What's going on? Make your point, quickly. 5'4". Your Honor, the motorized seat in Tim's car was locked in the position of the last person who drove it. Based on my conversation with the impound lot manager, that driver would have been between 5'1" and 5'5". Here is his sworn affidavit. I now call your attention to the monitor. On the screen is a CSI photo of the driver's compartment at the time the car was found. Now I will magnify the image. [ giggles ] And I ask the jury to look closely at the seat. It's a ball! It's a styrofoam packing ball! While overly enthusiastic, my intern is correct. The styrofoam ball is consistent with the type used to pack "The Dancing Horse", which you said you picked up from Tim's house. So, we have evidence placing Lana in Tim's car. Lana, didn't you say that you've been upset with your husband, right? Yes, but I would never drive... So after you picked up "The Dancing Horse", - you took his favorite car for a joy ride. - No! That car he never, ever let you drive during his marriage. - Isn't that true? - No! No. Tim... Tim, you have to believe me! And that's when you accidentally hit Amy Robinson. And you freaked out and dumped his car down Mulholland. This is crazy. Would you please stop? ...and when the cops accused Tim, you used it to your advantage and figured out a way to finally get that Aspen home that you've been fighting for. [ beep ] Your witness. The D.A.'s office is dropping all charges against Tim Kline. We will be refiling against Lana Kline. What?! No. Tim... Tim, I can explain. So ordered. The witness will be remanded into custody. [ giggles ] Oh, my God, you are incredible. [ laughs ] Oh! [ both laugh ] [ laughing ] Oh. - Um, Tim. - Hmm? Can you excuse me for just a second? - Yeah, of course. - Thank you. Mark! - Hey. - Hi. So... Tim doesn't know that you came to me, does he? He has no idea. And you were just protecting him, as usual. Yeah. But instead, you protected both of us. I don't know how to thank you. No problem. [ laughs ] Excuse me. - Sure. Thank you. - You're welcome. Your phone is off. Grayson just texted me. He wants to see you now. [ cellphone ringing ] That hurts. What are you doing here? Thought you might want to gloat. That's more your style. Yeah, you're right. Can I buy you a latte? Okay. Uh, mind if I sit? I don't think that's a good idea. Kim, I feel terrible about what happened between us. I believe you. That being said, I'd be stupid to think that you could change. I mean, I knew who you were when we started dating, and I also know that the more things change, the more they stay the same. That's not fair. Maybe not. But now I'm asking you to please get out of my office. I'm sorry, but I don't validate parking. Okay. But I'm not done trying. [ sighs ] What are you doing here? I think you know. Grayson asked for me. He asked to see Jane, not Deb. I just want to be clear that we're on the same page. You know, maybe, just maybe, he remembers me. Me, as in Deb. And if that's true, then we'll be having a very different conversation, - but if it isn't... - Don't worry. I am Jane, his friend. Now, if you'll excuse me. Fred... If you didn't know Grayson was gonna get hit by that car, then why were you outside the restaurant? Because I thought you might need me, and I wanted to be there for you. I see. That was very thoughtful. It's kind of my job. Fred, I do realize that this wasn't your fault. And? And? [ chuckles ] I think I was just looking for someone to blame. So I'm sorry. You should go. Hey, Grayson. Hey. - Hey. - Hey! - Vanessa! - Jane, I'm so glad you're here. Me too. Um, Grayson, I... I heard you wanted to see me. His memory came back. Grayson: Well, most of it. I remember everything 'till I showed up at the restaurant to meet you. You don't remember our conversation? - No, nothing until I woke up here. - The doctor says it's common. I was gonna tell you that night that Vanessa and I are engaged. Ha! Well, she knows that now. [ laughs ] I do. And you've been such a good friend, and now Vanessa tells me you've been here every day. Jane, will you be my best man? Absolutely. [ laughter ] I mean, how could I say no? There could be universal repercussions. So, as my best man, you should know that, given the last few days, I've decided to speed things up. Our wedding is set one month from today. Wow. - Why waste any more time, right? - Wow. Right. Yes. I... I get that. You are amazing. Yeah, I sure am. Okay, um... I'm gonna leave you two lovebirds alone, and, uh, I'm gonna get back to work. - All right. - Bye, Jane. ♪ I can't really say ♪ ♪ Why everybody wishes they were somewhere else ♪ You okay?
