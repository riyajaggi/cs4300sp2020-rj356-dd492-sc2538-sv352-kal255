 ♪ JANE: Sea that aspiring modal there? That was ma, Deb, until the day I died. I thought I'd go straight to heaven, but there was a bit of a mix-up and I woke up in someone else's body. So now I'm Jane, a super-busy lawyer with my very own assistant. I got a new life, a new wardrobe. The only people who know what's going on with me are my girlfriend, Stacy, and my guardian angel, Fred. I used to think everything happened for a reason. And, well, I sure hope I was right.

 [AMY KUNEY'S 'PERFECT DAY' PLAYING] Breakfast of champions? Twizzlers are a food group, right? I don't wanna live in a world where they're not. I heard that Tony left for D.C. How are you doing with that? Uh... I'm really excited for him. It's a great opportunity. Yeah, it's the pits. The worst. Hey, how about I take you out for a real breakfast? I've got nothing till 10. That sounds great. Heh, heh, heh. Jane, the ADA is on the phone. I'm busy. You gotta bail someone out. I have a full case load. You're gonna wanna do this. Trust me, I don't.

 It's your mother. Rain check. Anytime. Hope she's okay. Thanks. ♪ [ELAINE SINGING "FRANKIE AND JOHNNY"] Loretta, that's your cue! Let's do it again! Oh! [SINGING] Janie! Oh, you look fantastic. Oh, thank you. Are you okay? I'm terrific. You're terrific? You're in jail. I didn't even know you were in town. It was a spontaneous trip. I went to the theater, saw Chicago, which, by the way, fantabulous, and I thought I'd do a little shopping. I was minding my own business when... God, you look gorgeous in cool colors. You know you're a winter. I know. So, Mom, I have your file here. Assault, disorderly conduct, indecent exposure? What happened? I was hot. I took my sandals off and had my feet in the fountain when this ignoramus mall cop told me I had to get out. I was defending myself and, heh, things got a little out of hand. The police took a blood alcohol test. Were you drinking? Of course not. When did Fashion Square become Tiananmen Square? This is serious. Oh, poo-poo-poo. Oh, I know how to cheer you up. [SINGING "WALKING ON SUNSHINE"] Mom... [SINGING] Please stop. Sing with me. [SINGING] We have to go to court now. Okey-dokey. Are you sure you're okay? I'm fantabulous! Bye, girls! [HUMMING] Oh, yeah. ♪ Hello, Fred. I'm late. I know. Again. Interesting story. I was on the 780 bus and transferred to the 757, but a water main broke. I ran eight blocks to catch the 335... I thought you carpooled with Jane? When we can, but sometimes I take the bus. I don't know how to drive. Well, if you want to keep this job, learn. Hello, Mr. Parker. I was, uh, looking for the deposition for the... Cooper case. Fred, get the Cooper depo for Mr. Parker. Right away. Uh... There's something on your lip, sir. It's right about... it's right about here. Is that lipstick? Tangerine Dream. Kim had me get some for her... yesterday. ♪ it's a good color on you, sir. Is this something I have to worry about? Absolutely not. Understood? Completely. Does he still need me to get the Cooper deposition? What do you think? Excuse me, you're a lawyer, right? Last I checked. Who are you? I'm Joan Finer. I don't have an appointment, and according to every lawyer I spoke to, I don't have a case. So you snuck past reception and found a junior associate without an assistant to stop you. Are you gonna kick me out? Not until I hear it. I'm an idiot. Not a great start. I invested all of my money with Max Adams. Oh, no. I never should have trusted him. But he was Max Adams. His company had been around for decades. I never dreamed it was some Ponzi scheme. Yeah, he was very good at what he did until he got caught. Look, I bust my ass on a teacher's salary, and he is out on bail, probably having lobster for lunch. Mr. Kent, I want my money back. And I am willing to fight for it. Ms. Finer, you've come to the right guy. Did you just roll your eyes, Miss Davenport? Hello? I'm not your mother. I'm a superior-court judge. And I hold your fate in my hands. So knock it off. She seems mean. Actually, she's fair. And a friend. Okay, on the criminal-mischief conviction, which covers all of your colorful graffiti, I'm sentencing you to 60 days of art school at the Lynwood Correctional Facility. Ha, ha, ha. Enjoy your stay. Docket ending 342. The State of California v. Elaine Bingum? Your Honor, the defendant is charged with aggravated assault and indecent exposure. The state recommends 30 days in jail and that bail be set at $10,000. What? That's insane! It's appropriate, Your Honor. Counsel, approach the bench. Yeah. Jane, is that your mother? Yes. Sure you should be representing her? Yes, it's fine. I mean, I know what I'm doing. Suit yourself. Proceed, counsel. Your Honor, my client should be released on her own recognizance. There is a perfectly good explanation for her actions. Indecent exposure? Well, it wouldn't be if I was 19. It's only indecent because I'm over 50. Heh, heh. My client is truly remorseful for her actions. This is hardly the face of remorse. Really? ♪ I'm ordering a psychological evaluation. That's a total waste of time. You're not helping. And I'm granting the ROR. Thank you, Your Honor. Under one condition. That she's released into your custody. You have to keep a tight rein on her, Ms. Bingum. Do you understand? We get it. We're glued at the hip, right, Janie? That's right, Mom. ♪ ELAINE: I just took my shoes off to get into the water. It was 100 degrees, for Pete's sake. Mom, I will handle this. Paul. Three little misdemeanors? What do you say we dismiss with time served and call it a day? I'd like to, but it would be malfeasance, given her priors. Malfeasance. Ooh. Sounds dirty. Heh, heh. Priors? What are you talking about, priors? He must have seen my rap sheet. You have a rap sheet? Convicted of shoplifting, trespassing, arson. All in the past few years. Jane, my hands are tied. ♪ JANE: How could you not tell me you had priors? ELAINE: What do you mean? You know about the shoplifting. You got me off. I did? Like I was gonna, you know, steal a $500 wallet. I didn't know it was still in my hand when I walked out of the store. We're lucky that judge thought I was adorable. Okay. What about the arson? I was having a little luau and my tiki torches accidentally set the neighbor's tool shed on fire. That thing was an eyesore anyways. And the trespass? I was using a neighbor's Jacuzzi. How was I to know their trip to Borneo would be cut short by a typhoon? It's all so ridiculous! Okay. You have to tell me the truth. Do you have a drinking problem? I enjoy a fuzzy navel every now and again, but I am no boozehound. We're sorry about your client's financial predicament, but there's nothing we can do. You promised a 20 percent return. You said my money was secure. You had strategies, experience. You cleaned me out. You have my sympathy, Ms. Finer. But my philosophy has always been investments, like life, are unpredictable. When you hand over money, it's a calculated gamble. Is that a life lesson? Because you're under indictment. You're the last one who should be teaching. If you look at what our client is asking for... What you call a calculated gamble, I call a con! How's this for a life lesson: Never trust a scum-sucking bottom feeder! If you'll excuse us. Let's go. Yes. Like to kick a man when he's down? When he deserves it. Maybe you didn't hear the news. Mr. Adams was just diagnosed with stage four pancreatic cancer. You have a nice day. The Rulings of Justice William O. Douglas. Snore! [snores] Ha, ha, ha. I don't know how you made it through law school without lapsing into a coma. You know, I got the smarts to be a lawyer, even a judge. I always know exactly what Judge Judy ends up saying. Here you go, Elaine. You left your purse in the ladies' room. For crying out loud. Ha, ha, ha. I was busy talking to the girl in the next stall. Yeah, that was me. The L.A.P.D. just faxed over a copy of her blood test. No alcohol. What did I tell you? But there were trace metabolites of escitalopram. Trace metabolites? Well, heh, heh, heh, aren't you Mrs. David Caruso. I was feeling a little blue and my GP gave me a prescription for antidepressants. No biggie. What if there's something actually wrong with you? Like an aneurysm or a tumor. Can't you just accept that your mother's a little eccentric? She thinks I should be staying home all day baking cookies. Cookie! That might hit the spot. Are there still free Oreos in the kitchen? Yeah. Yay. Okay. I don't understand this. She was not like this when she was here before. Something's going on. She's always offbeat, now she's just off. Maybe it's menopause. No way. There's been no weeping, sweating or throwing a flank steak. My mom had a rough time. Oh, the doctor doing the psych evaluation called. A family member has to back up her medical history. I told him you would do it. Oh. Okay. Um... You know what? Maybe my dad can help with this. Yeah, like that would ever happen. Since they split, you say his name, she walks out. Well, then I'll call him. Okay, but you haven't talked to Henry in, like, forever. Well, then maybe forever ends today. You have a 2 p.m. deposition at Gottwald & Suskind and a 3:15 conference call with Gary Simmons of... We still on for lunch? Absolutely. But you brought your lunch today. Vietnamese chicken wrap. I'll get my jacket. What was that? Reminding you you don't have to go to lunch because... I'll be back when I'm back. And I was serious earlier, learn how to drive. Teri, you must be a good driver since you fit your big SUV in that tiny compact-only spot every morning. Yes, I am an excellent driver. Will you teach me? You don't know how? Nobody drives where I'm from. Oh, you're from New York? A little further north. What's in it for me? Lunch. I've done more for less. Great. Thanks for babysitting Elaine, my mom. Oh, and if she asks, do not tell her I'm meeting Henry, my dad. She'll freak out. No problem. So, what do you wear to meet a father you've never met? Seersucker. Light and breezy. That was a rhetorical question. Oh. Then definitely denim. Going out? Uh... Yeah. Is it a date? No. Uh-huh. What's he like? Uh, I've never met him before. Oh, a blind date! Heh, heh, heh. Those are a crap shoot. One time I was set up with a guy who brought his mother. At least she could dance. Oh, God, I feel like driving to Vegas. Don't worry. it'll be okay. Thanks, Since. I am nervous. Teri says I haven't talked to my dad in 10 years. I have no idea why. Maybe you did something really awful and he hasn't forgiven you yet. Thanks. it's really comforting. Or he did something unforgivable. Or maybe we never got along. This is crazy. I'm in the middle of a family drama, and it's not even my family. No. It's really nice to see you. You just said that. But it's nice to see you too, Dad. It's been a long time, jellybean. Yeah. So like I was saying on the phone, we really need to talk about mom. You know, I'm surprised you ordered a drink. Why? Am I allergic? No, no. But after your feminist studies class, you swore off liquor because the patriarchal and sexist alcohol industry objectified women through their advertising. Oh. Heh, heh. Well, I guess I got over that. Please come with me to mom's doctor's appointment tomorrow. Not a good idea. I don't know what's going on with her. Welcome to my world. The last few years were tough. One day she'd want to open a bed and breakfast in Maui, the next she'd bring home French bulldogs to breed. But she wasn't always like that, right? Oh, God, no. We had so much fun. We'd go dancing and hiking. Fridays were always game night. Remember? Uh-huh. Yeah. Mom would make chicken pot pie and we'd play charades and laugh for hours. I felt like the luckiest guy in the world. Then it changed. I couldn't reach her. So, what about me? What about you? We haven't spoken in a longtime... I left you so many messages. I understand why you didn't call. You were angry because I left your mother. But I swear to you, the last thing I ever wanted was to hurt you. ♪ Scum-sucking bottom feeder? I've never seen you lose it like that. I meant it. Your face was purple. He knows exactly how I feel. And our client enjoyed the show, but what's next? You're dropping this case. What? I got off the phone with Mr. Adams' attorney. Even if you win, your client won't see a dime. What are you doing, Grayson? It's a long shot. It's a lost cause. Adams' remaining assets will be liquidated to pay his legal fees, which are going to Bellson and Tweed. Know how much work they send us? You're stepping on their toes. I want you both to cut your losses. ♪ The image of Jesus on a pancake went for $15,000 on eBay and I'm the one who needs a psychological exam? Ha! Please. Hi. Henry? Hello, Elaine. What is he doing here? I asked him to come. You ambushed me. Don't blame Jane. She's just trying to help. How do you like that? Two against one. Some things never change. That's not how it was and you know it. Can we not do this here, please? I'm leaving. This exam isn't voluntary. Hi, I'm Dr. Landers. Hi. Mrs. Bingum, why don't you come in. [CAR HORNS HONKING] Move it! What the...? Come on! MAN: Get off the road! [PEOPLE SHOUTING] [HORN HONKING] See? I'm a natural. Don't talk, I'm nauseous. There's things they don't teach in the DMV handbook. If someone pisses you off, just lay on your horn and use your middle finger. Horn, middle finger. Got it. [POLICE SIREN WAILS] COP: You in the Jeep, pull over! Hey! But you said... Not to a cop! You don't have a license. Just pull over and make something up. Tell them I'm sick and you're driving me to the hospital. [SIREN WAILS] License and registration. I'm assuming you don't have a license. That's correct, officer. I'm sorry. it's embarrassing to admit. I mean, I'm an adult and I don't know how to drive. Thank you for your honesty. Most people make up some B.S. about being sick, having to go to the hospital to get out of the ticket. How lame is that? Well, I'm giving you a warning. Your back taillight is out. That's it? I'd suggest you hike over the wheel until your boyfriend here gets his learner's permit. Oh, him and me? No, no, no. I'm just his driving instructor. Hey, your badge says "to protect and defend." That is what I do. Really? Auxiliary police? Sort of. Yeah. You have a nice smile. Thank you, officer. Um... You have very attractive ears. Heh. If it isn't inappropriate, maybe we should grab a drink sometime? I would enjoy that, officer. I'm Jocelyn. Give me your number and I'll give you a call. There you are. Take care of that taillight. I love driving. So based on my examination, I've concluded your mother is bipolar. What? Ha, ha. I am not crazy. If I'm crazy, then half this city is. Have you been to a 24-hour doughnut shop? Everyone is certifiable. It's common for people with bipolar disorder to feel as if nothing is wrong. Nothing is wrong. I feel fantastic. Elaine, you feel great now because you're in a manic state. There's another side of this syndrome which manifests as depression. If your condition is left untreated, it can be dangerous. But it can be treated, right? With the right medication, therapy and exercise, you can lead a completely normal life. I am living a normal life. My normal. Elaine, please don't run away from this. It's not your business. You cheated on me. Elaine. You left me. You do not get a vote on my life. ♪ I still haven't heard from Officer Jocelyn. You know how people are. They buy you a drink, tell you you're hotter than Lucy Liu, say they're gonna call, then nothing. Jerk. [PHONE RINGING] It's her. Don't be desperate. I was afraid you wouldn't call. Oh, that's perfect. Tomorrow's great. At Harrison and Parker, or I could take the bus. I can't wait. She's picking me up here. What am I gonna wear? Well, since she's wearing the pants, I'd go with a tube top and short shorts. The sarcasm? it's borderline bitter. You think I'm bitter? Um... Jane available? Hey, how's it going with your mom? Oh, thanks for asking. Don't ask. Heh, heh. Okay. Sol hear Parker's not real happy with you. That would be an understatement. I'm not dropping this case. I saw Max Adams and his girlfriend in the paper today. There's a woman who has a radar for money. Her radar's malfunctioning. I've subpoenaed his financial records. He's got nothing left. Well, she's not with him for the quiet evenings of chess and Chopin. So there is cash somewhere. Are you saying I missed something? I'm not doing a good job? No. I just was making an observation. You're really taking this case personally. Why? I feel bad for my client. She's a teacher, lost everything. I believe that you care about your client. But you never lose your temper. You don't know me that well, Jane. Right. I gotta go. ♪ This says the symptoms of bipolar syndrome were first described in the 2nd century. Wow. People have been moody for a very long time. Hey, Jane, could...? Um... Can I, uh, talk to you for a minute? What's up? Excuse me. Ahem. I, uh... I need your help. Is it wrong for me to go out with somebody else when I'm still in love with... Ah... I mean, I like this woman, Officer Jocelyn, but we both know that... is the one. You can go out with whomever you want until...is interested. ELAINE: God, I'm going stir crazy. Will you let me go out to the patio or do I have to wear a GPS anklet? Well, actually I'm going to the mall to pick out some new threads. You want to come with me? If it's okay with El Comandante. Sure, you can buy something to wear for the hearing tomorrow. I promise to get something that screams normal. Fred, do not let her out of your sight. Or anywhere near a fountain. ELAINE: Bye. Bye. Okay. This book says bipolar disorder is genetic. So that means... I could have inherited it. Yeah. There's so much I don't know about this body. Oh! Never mind. The onset usually occurs between the ages of 15 and 30. Oh. You're way past that. [DOORBELL RINGS] Now, that was fast. Hi, I'm... My dad. Oh. Nice to meet you. I'm Stacy. Hi. Can we talk? Sure. Oh, I'll be in my room. Wow. Oh, yeah. Heh, heh, heh. So I'm glad we're back in touch again. I've really missed you. Yeah. I'm sorry I didn't call sooner. I guess I just wasn't ready till now. It's okay. I came by to let you know I'm heading back to Palm Springs. Why? I was really hoping you would be in court tomorrow. The judge might be lenient on mom because we can show that she's bipolar. Your mom wants nothing to do with me. I just get her angry. But she needs your help. She needs to help herself. So you're just gonna leave again? I know you care about her. I do. But until she deals with her problem, nothing is ever gonna change. I'm sorry, jellybean. ADAMS: Where do you want to go? REESA: Shopping. Mr. Adams. Back away or I will move for a restraining order. I want to apologize. I'm terribly sorry, sir. I would never raise my voice to a dying man. Especially one with a large life insurance policy. Life insurance policies are exempt from lawsuits like yours. I'm aware of that. That's why we intend to pursue Reesa Venable, the beneficiary of the 5-million-dollar policy. [CHUCKLES] He can't do that, can he? Given the circumstances, a court might find the entire policy to be a fraudulent conveyance. Is Parker aware you're continuing this nonsense? That's my business, not yours. Well, this isn't the time or place. My office. One o'clock. LANDERS: It's classic manic behavior. Impulsive, reckless, poor judgment, an inflated sense of importance. Oh, come on, it's funny! JANE: Shh. Mrs. Bingum, please try to respect these proceedings. Continue, counselor. Dr. Landers, you examined Mrs. Bingum? Would you share your conclusions with the court? She meets the criteria for bipolar disorder under section 340.2 of the DSM. At the time of the incident, her blood work revealed an antidepressant called escitalopram. Is that a proper way to treat bipolar disorder? No. When a bipolar patient is given escitalopram, it can trigger a full-on manic phase. That's what happened to Mrs. Bingum. She was no longer in control of her actions. No longer in control. Thank you. Dr. Landers, if a patient knew she were bipolar and asked for a prescription of antidepressants wouldn't she be responsible for her own actions? Yes, of course. Were you aware Elaine Bingum was diagnosed bipolar 15 years ago? Is that true? I had no idea. Records from the Yucaipa Health Clinic first diagnosing Ms. Elaine Bingum with bipolar disorder. June 1995. Now, stop talking about me like I'm not in the room. SUMMERS: Okay. That's enough. I want defense counsel in my chambers now. Stacy, go. What? Please, go! SUMMERS: What the hell's going on, Jane? If you tried to hide the fact your mom was previously diagnosed with this, you're guilty of perjury. I didn't know. She's your mother, Jane. How did you not know? Well, no one knew. Not even my father. And that is the truth. Go out there, find her, and bring her back. I will. I promise. And if she disappears, Jane, I'm gonna have to issue a warrant. For both of you. Okay. Whoa, whoa. I told you to drop your case. I don't want the firm involved. It isn't. I amended the notice to my address. I'm doing this on my own. Then get a table at Denny's, not my conference room. Bill me. You're violating your agreement. Then fire me. Our top associates have researched Mr. Adams' life insurance policy and assure me it's bulletproof. "Your top associates"? That can be pretty pricey. What do you bill them at, 400 an hour? That's not relevant. It is to whoever pays the bill, which is Ms. Venable. In order to pay their associates, they have to borrow against the policy. The more they borrow, the less you get when Mr. Adams passes away. Instead of talking about fees, we should discuss withdrawal of your claim. Do the math. You can continue to allow them to blow through your money to pay for this zealous defense, or you can cut a reasonable deal to my client right now. Reesa, they're harassing you into a settlement. Don't let them do this. It's about the principle. The principle? Does that mean you'll be waiving your fees? We can win this. That's not what I asked. Ms. Finer, I'll agree to pay you everything you lost. Plus attorney fees. Okay. As long as we keep this out of the press. And you're no longer representing me. Max, talk to her. You heard the lady. You're off the clock. I'll draw up the papers. FINER: Thank you! Hey. Thanks, Since. No problem. Oh, your mom threw her shoes down a storm drain, so I gave her the Swarovski crystal flip-flops that I had in my car. They will look great in court, you can dress them up or down. Thanks, Since. You're welcome. Okay. Bye. Bye. You okay? I know that you are upset, but I'm only doing what I think is right. Please talk to me. [SINGING 'WALKING ON SUNSHINE'] [SINGING] [CHUCKLES] Honey, I didn't mean to keep it from you. I just felt so ashamed. I barely admitted being bipolar to myself. That is the first time I have ever said it out loud. You don't have to be embarrassed. But you do have to deal with it. I tried the drugs. They made me feel like somebody else. I would look in the mirror and I wouldn't even recognize myself. You have no idea what that is like. Try me. Listen, I have been doing some reading, and the medications have really improved. The doctor just has to find the right balance. It scares me, Janie. I know. I know, Mom. SUMMERS: Welcome back, Mrs. Bingum. Let me tell you how we will proceed. There will be no more wasting time. You either make a commitment to go into a treatment program, or you go to jail. Your Honor, may I please implore... No. Mr. Saginaw, you may not. You will go along with this decision, or, trust me, next time you're in my courtroom I will remember you. There is one caveat, and that is that someone needs to be responsible for Mrs. Bingum while she's in outpatient treatment. I will, Your Honor. If Elaine promises to get on the right medication and stay on it, I'd like to move back in with her. If she'll have me. Your Honor, can we have a moment? Take your time, counselor. I know you believe I cheated on you, but I never did. Elaine, I never stopped loving you, I just couldn't live with you. But if this medication has a chance of bringing you back to me... I wanna take that chance. I know you didn't cheat on me, Henry. I was so ashamed of the way I acted, it was easier to blame you. Can you forgive me? I already have. [ELAINE SOBBING] Your Honor, Mr. Bingum has agreed to take responsibility for Mrs. Bingum. Elaine Bingum is remanded into her ex-husband's supervision. Thank you. Thank you, Janie. [ALL LAUGH] After your family reunion, could I see you, counselor, in my chambers, please? [KNOCKING ON DOOR] You wanted to see me? One time, early in my very distinguished career, I threatened to quit when the partner wanted to pull my case. What happened? I was terminated. I called Bellson and Tweed and said you were fired. I understand. Then they asked to hire you. What? They said they could use someone like you. They didn't like that you took the case, but were impressed by how you won. What did you say? That I wasn't letting you go. Get back to your office and work on your billable hours. Yes, sir. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] SUMMERS: Come on in. Hey. The usual? Uh... Sure. But no nuts. No wet walnuts? Oh, Jane, please. Tell me you're not turning into one of those twits who counts calories. Listen, I can't thank you enough. I really appreciate... I know. Let's leave it at that, okay? I don't do gratitude very well. You know, I liked your family. They're good people. Yeah, they are. I always thought it was strange that you never really spoke about them. Oh. Well, I guess I was embarrassed. Well, don't be. You know, once, my mom stabbed my dad with a kebab skewer. What? Was she bipolar too? No, Italian. Yeah. Hey. Hi. What are you doing here? It's after 5. I'm looking for you. Jane, I'm sorry about before. You were right. I treated my case personally. Oh, it happens. No, I overreacted with you and you deserve to know why. Okay. It's my dad. He was scammed by a guy like Max Adams. Oh. Destroyed my parents' marriage. Wait, but your parents are still together. They're so happy. Alan is my stepfather. Wait, what? My father lost everything. He left when I was 3. I never saw him again. I'm so sorry. Mom and Alan married a few years later. I love him like a father. But I wonder what would've happened if my dad hadn't been ripped off. Grayson, I had no idea. You never said anything. Well, it is kind of personal, right? Right. Yes. Of course. The good news is, I got my client everything she lost. Well, your father would be proud. Hm. How do I look? I'm not sure about stripes. Do they make my shoulders look too boyish? Relax, princess. Just be yourself. That's what she liked about you. I don't get it, but go with it. Honesty. Got it. ♪ Hi, Officer Jocelyn. You, uh... You look amazing. You can call me Jocelyn. Right. Right. No, I just... I, um... I hardly recognized you without your, uh, badge. Oh, yeah, well, there's, uh, nowhere to pin it. [CHUCKLES] Should we go? Yeah. Sure. Sure. Since our relationship is based on honesty, I should tell you something. Um... You are incredible and I am so excited about our date, but I'm totally in love with another woman. However, she is unavailable to me right now, so let's go out and have a blast. Yeah. You know, I should be perfectly honest with you too. You are a major jackass. I thought you liked my honesty. I'd like to Taser you. But instead I'll just give you another warning. Don't ever, ever be that honest again. You have got to be kidding me. I wouldn't have had fun if I didn't tell the truth. Your dream girl better be worth it. She is. She is. ELAINE: Okay. Three words. HENRY: Three syllables. Three syllables, right? Is this the first? HENRY: Is it two syllables? Five syllables? Ha, ha, ha. HENRY: How'd it go from three sylla...? Jane, thank God you're finally home. Will you please tell Stacy that Maya Angelou is not a resort in Mexico. Well, then where did my manicurist get engaged? [TIMER DINGS] Oh. Saved by the bell. Chicken pot pie coming right up. I never thought I'd hear that again.
