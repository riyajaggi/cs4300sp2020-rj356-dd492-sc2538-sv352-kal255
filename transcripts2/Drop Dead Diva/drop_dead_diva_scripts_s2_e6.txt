 [???] JANE: See that aspiring model there? That was me, Deb, until the day I died. I thought I'd go straight to heaven, but there was a bit of a mix-up, and I woke up in someone else's body. So now I'm Jane, a super-busy lawyer with my very own assistant. I got a new life, a new wardrobe. The only people who know what's going on with me are my girlfriend, Stacy, and my guardian angel, Fred. I used to think everything happened for a reason. And, well, I sure hope I was right.

 [JO Y WILLIAMS' "TURNAROUND" PLAYING] STAC Y: Jane. Jane. Jane! Hi. Hmm. There better be a fire. Ahem. Your assistant can't get you on your cell, so she called mine. Teri? What did she want? Ahem. You have a new client. Someone in showbiz. Someone big. Julia Roberts big or Jersey Shore big? She said they're in music. Oh, my God. That means it might be [IN UNISON] J. Lo! Okay. I have to get dressed.

 [???] Teri called me too. Stacy got so excited, she hung up. Apparently the case is Graysors but he's requested you as second chair. Oh, my God. Okay, now we've worked together, but he's never specifically requested me. Oh! This is awesome. Okay, important question. What are you gonna wear? Uh... Oh. This. A Michael Kors cowl neck sweater? No, no, no. J. Lo prefers a swooping neckline. Of course. I don't know what I would do without you. [CONFETTI'S "BEGIN AGAIN" PLAYING OVER EARPHONES] [CHUCKLES] Okay. How do I look? Where's J. Lo? It's not J. Lo. Miley? Colbie? Britney? Confetti. Who? They're a sister act. Check them out. [CONFETTI'S "BEGIN AGAIN" PLAYING OVER COMPUTER] [JANE CHUCKLES] They're sweet. Like a diabetic coma. Stacy said you said it was someone big. This is the second most downloaded video on YouTube. Number one is a bull doing it with a chicken. I love that video. Jane, thanks for helping me out. Oh, yeah. I'm happy to second chair. Um... Just curious, I mean, why me? Someone's fishing for a compliment. Remember that playlist you made for Al's retirement party? You know your pop music. Yes, I do. For example, did you know that Madonna's bra from the Blonde Ambition tour sold for $20,000? I did not. And I'm not sure that will be helpful to our case. Anyways, Dewey & Pierce are repping Jessica. You have Tina, the one in pink. Arraignment's at 11. What did they do? Trash a hotel suite, or shoplift from Barneys? Jane, they're accused of murder. [???] Should we have taken separate elevators? No one's paying attention. Good morning, Mr. Parker, Ms. Kaswell. You arrived at the same time again. Inside voice, Fred. Oh, um, Mr. Parker, sir, a Francine Waters is in your office. She's upset. Francine runs an amazing bed and breakfast in Santa Barbara. Ms. Kaswell, why don't you join me? I'd be happy to, Mr. Parker. [???] "From check-in to checkout, the Hideaway Inn was bleak and depressing. A good waterboarding would've been more relaxing than my weekend." It gets worse from there. I don't understand. Your place is spectacular. Since the review came out on HipTripz, occupancy is down 75 percent. If I don't recover, I'll be forced to sell. HipTripz. Net is an online travel guide. It's the industry leader. I've seen bad reviews before. This is brutal. It's vindictive. A few months ago, I refused to buy ad space on their website. Have you been in touch with the reviewer? HipTripz is like the Michelin Guide. There's 26 contributing writers but individual reviews are anonymous. This is clear defamation. Kim will file an action on your behalf. We'll demand that they take down the review and issue a full apology. [???] This doesn't make any sense. I mean, Chris was our manager. He got me and Jess a record deal. And now the cops think we killed him? Tina, do you have any idea why they suspect you? No. I mean, we had disagreements, but Chris was a friend. You told the police that you have an alibi? Yes. I was at the movies... Jessica. You okay? I'm totally freaked. Me too. Mr. Kent, Vanessa Hemmings with Dewey & Pierce. Nice to meet you. And this is my second chair. Jane. Jane Bingum. It's a pleasure. Listen, even though our clients require separate representation, how would you feel about a joint strategy given their mutual alibi? United front. Couldrt agree more. Me too. Docket ending 627 and 628, Tina and Jessica Orlando. Charge is first degree murder. The State contends that defendants believing they had been cheated by Chris Fabrikant, acted to cause his death by bludgeoning. The State requests the defendants be held without bail. Counselors? BOTH: Your Honor... Go ahead. These women have never had so much as a traffic ticket and both have deep roots in the community. They're both employed. They have studio time and tour dates booked. VANESSA: We're not asking they be released on recognizance. We are asking you consider a bond. In what amount? One hundred thousand dollars, Your Honor. [???] So ordered. [CROWD CHATTERING] That went well. Yeah, not bad. Vanessa's a good lawyer. You think? And pretty. Uh... I didn't notice. Come on, Grayson. You loosened your tie like three times. That's your thing. Whenever you... What? I don't have a thing. Hey, nice work in there. We were just saying the same. So we've got a mountain of discovery. Wanna discuss strategy over dinner? GRAYSON: Sounds great. Your conference room or mine? Come to Harrison & Parker. We'll order Chinese. Okay. Looking forward to it. Me too. I can't wait. Mm. That is a lot of blood. VANESSA: Head wounds will do that. ADA's gonna prejudice the jury with the violence of it. Pass the chow fun. Time of death is sometime between 9:30 and 10:30 p.m. That's good for our girls. Their movie started at 8:45. But the theater was only couple miles from where the victim was killed. They could've gone back and forth. Prosecution claims that, we'll argue someone would've seen them. Let's talk motive. They'll argue that our clients were unappy with their contract. A two-record deal for half a million dollars? What's to be unappy about? It's the music business. A half a mil is meaningless. Every expense is charged against it. Girls like this don't chase money, they chase fame. I mean, look at the murder weapon. It's a MALLie? It's their MALLie. A 2010. JANE: The annual award for the most popular shopping mall touring act, which means they were performing for free. My point is, these girls have been working their asses off. Killing their manager wouldn't improve their contract. And my point is, the prosecution is going full barrel after murder one, which means they know something that we don't. And to be honest, I don't have a good feeling about this. Yeah, neither do I. [CONFETTI'S "BEGIN AGAIN" PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS] Hey, you're listening to my client. I know. Fred told me. I can't believe my best friend is representing a Confetti girl. I can't believe you've heard of them. I tried to see them but people lined up and I couldn't get into the mall. Wait, when was that? Two months ago. Where was I? Working, like always. "Always"? I'm not always working. And I'm not always wearing butt-toning sneakers. So are you representing the skinny one or the other one? They're like a size zero and a size 2. Right. So which one? Tina, the size zero. She used to be bigger but her manager made her lose like 20 pounds before their first mall tour. Maybe that's her motive. [???] Ha-ha-ha. Yeah, completely. You know, you are so funny. No, you're so funny. No, you are so funny. No, you are. Fred. I miss your cute little face. Can you get Tina's autograph for me? I'll see what I can do. Thank you. Oh, yeah. Oh, a French movie. That's perfect. Oh, and then maybe we can go to Mulholland afterwards. I'll show you the lights. There's no one on that phone. What? Of course there is. Hold on a second, honey. Give me the phone. The fake girlfriend to make Stacy jealous. Fred, really? I needed Stacy to notice me, and on TV they say sexual jealousy is a strong motivator. Oh. So you're taking advice from The Real Housewives? Animal Planet. Did you know that a female zebra pays more attention to a male if he's taken? Fred, Stacy is not a zebra. She's not gonna fall for the invisible girlfriend on the phone bit. Sorry. PARKER: Good morning. You saved the Hideaway Inn yet? I have a settlement meeting. Good. I've scoured their records. Since our client purchased the hotel, there have been three complaints and two were from a guest who's allergic to yellow. Like I said, it's a magnificent place. And like I said, I've gone through all their records, so... Anything you wanna tell me, Parker? Don't know what you're getting at. All those Friday afternoon depositions when you were unreachable, you were getting a shiatsu massage on the Santa Barbara coast. And the occasional body scrub. Keep it to yourself. Keep me posted. Let's start with the food. According to the reviews, the potatoes were rotten. Our vegetables are picked daily from our gardens. Our kitchers been nominated for three Silver Spoon Awards. Award certificate, the most recent restaurant inspector report. Let's move on to beds. Miss Kaswell... Per your review, "A good night's sleep at the Hideaway is an oxymoron. Sheets are like sandpaper." We use the finest 900-thread-count Egyptian cotton. Receipts for the linens. We don't need receipts. We stand by our reviewer, whose opinion is protected. Let's cut to the chase. When my client refused to buy ad space on your site, you trashed her inn. It's extortion. I have the most trusted travel review site on the web. You think I'd mortgage my credibility for a few dollars in ad revenue? If you're so confident, why all the secrecy? Our reviewers stay anonymous to protect our integrity. We're done here. [???] Can I ask you something? You just did. Hilarious. This private investigator's degree is it for real or did it come out of a cereal box? Always nice talking to you. Have a good day. I'm sorry, that came out wrong. I know you've done some investigative work. I was wondering if you could help me out. Well, gee, since you asked so nicely. Teri, I have this client, a woman much nicer than I am. She's about to be run out of business by a website that trashed her B & B. I'm listening. I need the name of the reviewer, and anything you could dig up on the woman who owns the site. $ 175. What? That's how much that degree cost me. Plus, I had to pass a multiple-choice exam. And, yes, I'll do it. Thank you. In the lab, I was able to lift several latent prints off the murder weapon. Were you able to match any to the defendants? Yes. To both of them. [???] Fingerprints can last a long time, right? Sure. So it is possible that the prints date back to when Tina and Jessica received the award? It's possible. I rent the space next door to Chris. I heard singing. It was that Confetti song, "Begin Again." When the singing stopped, there was a thud. What did you do? I went over there. The back door was open. Chris was in a pool of blood. So I called 911. [CLEARS THROAT] You're also a talent manager, correct? I am. About a year ago, did you approach Confetti to represent them? Yes. And at that time, did you tell Tina and Jessica, they'd never get a record deal without you? Objection. Relevance? JANE: He had a grudge against the defendants and victim. The jury should be aware of his bias. The witness will answer. I say that to all potential clients. Two weeks later, they signed with Chris. Win some, lose some. At a Grammy party, did you throw Chris against a wall and accuse him of stealing them? [???] I guess. I was mad, but... No more questions. Scheduling, the booking slips, promotions. I handle everything for Chris. Well, I did. The night before the murder, you were there when Jessica and Tina showed up, right? Yes. They were upset, werert they? Maybe. A little. Any idea why? Chris told the record label he was turning their duo into a trio. Thought they'd be more marketable. And they were angry? They threatened to leave him but Chris shrugged it off. Said he owned them. Marjorie, this is your statement to the police the day after the murder. Would you please read the highlighted portion? "As they left the studio, Tina threatened Chris." What exactly did she say? She told Chris he better watch his back. DUSHAY: Thank you. [GAVEL POUNDING] "Watch your back." It's just trash talk. Well, to a jury it sounds like a threat. I'm not stupid. I never would have said it if I was gonna... Kill him? Okay. Tina, why didn't you tell us about the fight with Chris? We were mad. We felt betrayed. But I didn't think it was relevant because we didn't kill him. Look, it's always been me and Jessica. I don't care what the contract says. You can't force a stranger into a sister act. And Chris was supposed to protect us. Guys, the ADA is here and he's got that face that says "let's make a deal." Tina, would you wait in my office with Teri? Yeah. [???] Right this way. So here's my offer: Ten years. She's out in eight. If Tina testifies against her sister? That's right. I've got a good case but I need the slam dunk. We'll take it to our client. Thanks for dropping by. Now let's tell Tina why she's not gonna take the deal. Really? So you're just gonna reject it out of hand. You're not even gonna ask my opinion? We've been out of court two hours, and Vanessa's firm is closer to the courthouse. Trust me, he went to Jessica first. And she already turned him down, or else he wouldn't have shown up. Well, my opinion, is that I agree with you. [CHUCKLES] It's like I'm second-chairing their first date and it's going on forever. Hmm. Are you sure Grayson sees Vanessa that way? Yeah. He looks at her the same way he used to look at me. Well, Deb. Me. The way we look at pizza after aerobics. Yeah. It's a starter house but I call it home. It's comfy. Eventually, I'll move up to something bigger. Hey, Fred. Oh, hey, guys, I didn't even see you there. Who's your friend? Thi... Oh, well, this... Jane, Stacy, this is Kiley, my girlfriend. Nice to meet you. We're on our way out for the night. Fred's taking me to the theater. Yup. Dinner and a show, the whole package. That is what you get when you date me. Fred. Hmm? Can I talk to you for a moment? Sure. Seriously, Fred, who is that? My girlfriend. You don't have one. I do. Since when? Today. Met her online. What? Okay, look, she wants a boyfriend and I need a real girlfriend to make Stacy jealous. I know what I'm doing. No. Uh! Hi. Fred, Stacy said she can get us into Chez Amour for dinner. That's great. It's no problem. I'm dating the maitre d'. Really? Well, dating isn't the right word for it. Well, that's good. You gotta be careful who you date these days. You should probably get to know somebody... It's mostly physical. But use my name at the door and he'll get you in. Oh, and tell him to call me. Awesome. The HipTripz staff is composed of highly trained carefully screened professionals. Why not just take down the review and avoid this litigation? EMMA: Because we'd lose all credibility. RESNICK: So you continue to stand by the Hideaway review? EMMA: Absolutely. Your witness. Publishing a negative review for the sake of lining your own pocketbook that wouldn't be right, would it? I would never do that. Have you heard of the Hotel Oblique? It's across the street from the Hideaway Inn. Isn't it true you and your husband are investors and that you're using your website to take out the competition? Due to my husband's job, our assets are managed by a blind trust. So I had no idea I was an investor in that hotel. And I'm happy to have our financial adviser testify to just that. [???] No further questions at this time. Hey, Fred, how was your date? Ugh. Stacy's maitre d' is a loser. He's got one of those soul patches looks like a hairy caterpillar died on his chin, and his biceps are too large for his body. It's unappealing. Yeah. I was talking about Kiley. She had a lovely time. What if she starts falling for you? Are you just gonna break her heart? I hadrt really thought about that. I suppose it's possible. Sometimes, without even trying, I can be irresistible. You are using her, Fred. No, I'm not. I'm platforming her interest as a way of getting Stacy see me in a new light. Oh, wow, I'm using her. End it before she gets hurt. Tina, did you kill Chris Fabrikant? No. Tina, can you tell this jury exactly where you were the night your manager was killed? I was at the movies. Jess and I were seeing Twilight at the Santa Monica IMAX. It was opening weekend. Thank you. You didn't save your ticket stubs, did you? I wish we had. Did you buy your tickets online? No, at the box office. Did you get a credit card receipt? We paid cash. You paid cash for the 8:45 p.m. Showing at the IMAX Santa Monica? Yeah. Because according to their records, there were no tickets available at the box office for sale that night. That showing sold out online. You werert at the movies that night, were you? No. [CROWD MURMURING] Jessica, I'm so sorry. A brief recess, Your Honor? Good idea, Miss Bingum. [BANGS GAVEL You lied about your alibi? I'm sorry, okay? No, it's not okay. Where were you, Tina? I was home. Alone. All night. Why lie about the movie? It was Jessica's idea. I promised her... The night Chris was killed, Jess was driving up the coast, alone, in her convertible. She called as soon as she heard the news. She'd been badmouthing Chris all over town and she was flipped out. Scared she'd be accused of murder? That we both would be. That's exactly what happened. I swear, I didn't kill Chris. Did Jessica do it? I don't think so. I don't know for sure. We need to see if that deal is still on the table now. I can't turn on my sister. You either make a deal for yourself, or you are both going to prison for the rest of your lives. I'm sorry about the blind-trust thing. It's my fault, I overestimated you. Be nice. I'm about to make it up to you. I'm listening. I tracked down the name of your anonymous reviewer. What? How? Disgruntled ex-employee of HipTripz. And you have a rapport with the disgruntled. May I see? First, apologize for saying you overestimated me. I'm sorry. And? Thank you? You're welcome. [???] So 10 years was his opening offer yesterday. Try and get it down, but don't leave without a deal. Agreed. What the...? You just ran from the courtroom to the ADA's office. Apparently, I was just a few steps ahead of you. And, hey, it was your client who lied on the stand. To protect her sister. She won't be doing that anymore. Listen, there was one deal to be had... And you just made it. Yes. And I'm sorry for the surprise, but we're all just trying to do our job. All right. Here's the heads-up. Tomorrow, Jessica will testify that the night of the murder... We know. That she was driving up the coast alone. That's what she told Tina, but she was actually with Buckley Graham, Tina's ex-boyfriend. She didn't wanna tell Tina the truth because it would upset her. How do you know that's true? Buckley will appear in court tomorrow, ready to take the stand. I think my client was protecting yours You might wanna talk to her, about what really happened that night. [???] You okay, Fred? You barely touched your soup. Yeah. No, there's something that I need to say but I'm not sure how to say it. Just blurt it out. That's what I do. Okay, Kiley. Um... I think you're terrific and I've really enjoyed our time together. Me too. I know it's only been 48 hours, but it feels like a week. I'm gonna go ahead and blurt... MAN: Kiley. Glenn. What are you doing here? Your roommate told me you were here with some dork. I figured she was exaggerating... Hi, I'm Fred. We're in the middle of... You broke up with me. I can date whoever I want. Kiley, I miss you. I really miss you. Me too. You know, my soup is getting cold. It's gazpacho. How about we get out of here? There's an In-N-Out down the street. Oh, I love In-N-Out. Uh... It's... Go. I'll be outside, okay? I'm sorry. Glenrs kind of... The love of your life. You should go. Oh, thank you. [SIGHS] [???] STAC Y: Hey, sweetie. This is a nice surprise. I've been working on your case. Okay. What do you mean? See, I really, really wanted to help you prove Tina was innocent... But? I think she did it. And I've got props. [BOTH CHUCKLE] Okay. First, I went back to the night of the murder. I checked out TMZ, Instaparty, and a whole bunch of celebrity Twitter feeds. And do you know what I found out? No. Not a clue. STAC Y: La Bella. Who's she? Not a who, a what. La Bella's a new club in Hollywood. It opened that night. Everyone was there. Everyone except Jessica and Tina. Jessica has an alibi, Tina already told me she was home that night, alone. That's the point. Okay. So the whole party was stocked with paparazzi. And she's gonna stay home and miss it? No way. Everyone else in her Twitter-lnstaparty-Facebook universe was there. The only place that that girl would be on that Saturday night is at that club. Hence and thereforeto, if she wasrt there, then she was definitely committing murder. I wish the poster told a different story but it's pretty compelling stuff. I think that I need to talk to Tina. Kim, why am I here? I have a very busy afternoon. It won't take long. It's a tricky cross-examination of a hostile witness. And I could use your support, and insight. Well, it is nice to be needed. Court is back in session. Ms. Kaswell, call your next witness. Pursuant to my subpoena, the plaintiff would like to call Jill Morrell. God, no. Kaswell, I gotta go now. Sit down, boss. I'm about to win this case for you. Miss Morrell, you reviewed the Hideaway Inn for HipTripz? The reviews are anonymous. Ms. Morrell, HipTripz can't be compelled to reveal your identity, but in my courtroom, there is no anonymity. Okay. I wrote the review. Is it fair to say that one's experience at a hotel could be colored by her state of mind during the visit? I don't understand the question. A fine meal could taste a little bland if your dinner companion is boring. I suppose. Glorious sunset, little less dazzling when you hear a friend is sick? I guess. Objection. Ms. Kaswell, make your point. Context affects experience. When you were reviewing Hideaway, were you staying there alone? Ms. Morrell, you're under oath. No. Is your traveling companion in this room? Point of fact, you were at the Hideaway with J. Parker, that man sitting right there, werert you? [???] Yes. Point of fact, you stayed one night though you were booked for two? Yes. Why did you leave? Did something happen that colored your experience? Tell the court. JILL: It was during dinner. I told him I loved him. KIM: Do you recall his response? The word was "oops." Oops? It was the most humiliating moment of my life. Until now. Given how you felt, can you imagine enjoying your meal, or appreciating your accommodations? Probably not. Nothing further. Jessica was out with Buckley that night? Why wouldn't she tell me? She didn't wanna hurt your feelings. I wouldn't have cared. I'm so over that guy. Tina, you don't have an alibi, the motive is really convincing, and your own sister is about to bury you. Now, I don't think she wants to... But I didn't do it. And you don't believe me. Why did you miss the opening of La Bella? That's Anna Wintour skipping Fashion Week or Beyonc? bailing on the Grammys. Had you been there, you'd have the perfect alibi. Instead... I couldn't go. Because you were killing Chris? Because I was home. It's not good enough. I was home because I was trying to lose weight, okay? I don't follow. I had to lose 5 pounds. I was afraid Chris was hiring the third girl because I was gaining weight. It's so embarrassing. I was on the citrus cleanse diet. I wanted to go to the party, but I didn't feel well. It was day three. Oh, my God. I know day three. There is no way you could've left the house. Jane, I don't wanna go to jail. Then I better make sure you don't. [???] A retraction, an apology, and a new review? By a truly impartial reviewer. I couldn't ask for anything more. You could ask him not to break up with anyone else. Not a problem. Come back anytime. Next visit's on the house. You, me, two nights at the Hideaway? I like the idea. Not so sure about the location. Why? You realize for the last few days, I've scoured registration records. Sure. So? You've been there 11 times in two years. And your point? With how many different women? Come on, you know who I am. Well, maybe I'm not interested in being number 12. [???] How about we find our own place? Unless that scares you. Nothing scares me, Ms. Kaswell. [CHUCKLES] Just you wait. Wednesday night in the property room. You can sure show a guy a good time. This is every piece of evidence from the murder scene and the victim's files. Yes, I know. Why are we here? Like I explained on the phone, I believe our client is innocent. But tomorrow's testimony will bury her. On the phone, you said "citrus cleanse" and hung up. Right. [???] So I know she's innocent. The cops jumped to a conclusion, missed something. We have to find it. Okay. I'll start with the box over here. [ELLIE GOULDING'S "GUNS AND HORSES" PLAYING] Grayson, I got something weird. Weird? Every CD case is marked with the name of a demo song. And every CD has the associated artist's name on it. So this CD says, "Begin Again." Yeah, that's Confetti. But the case is empty. The guy said he heard "Begin Again" coming from the studio before Chris was killed. Maybe the girls werert singing, but he was actually listening to the CD. [???] Five bucks says this CD is in that player. Oh. What? It's "Begin Again" but it's not Confetti. [GUITAR PLAYING OVER SPEAKER] See if you recognize the voice. [WOMAN SINGING A SOULFUL VERSION OF "BEGIN AGAIN"] [SONG CONTINUES TO PLAY] [MUSIC STOPS] So that's your demo, isn't it? Yes, why were you playing it? How long have you taken voice lessons, Miss Little? Since seventh grade. And where did you go to college? The Berklee College of Music. Well, you have a beautiful voice. You should be singing for a living instead of bookkeeping. Thank you. You know, sometimes I feel like I'm not living my dreams. Ever feel that way? Objection. Overruled. The witness may answer. I think a lot of people feel that way. Yeah. When Chris wanted to add a third member to Confetti, did you think it should be you? Why not? You heard my voice. The night he was killed, did Chris listen to your demo? I don't know. Your demo was in his CD player. So you gave him your demo and told him you wanted your chance. I just asked him... To submit you to the record label for consideration? Yes. What did he say? [???] He told me I wasrt a good fit. Hmm. So you worked for the man for 11 years. That's all he said? He laughed at me. He said they'd never put my face on an album cover. Eleven years I waited for my chance. I'm sorry for what I did, but he just laughed. [CROWD MURMURING] MAN: Hey, Tina! I can't believe it's over. Thank you, Jane. You rock. WOMAN: Jessica! Jessica. I'm so sorry. I didn't know what to do, I was scared. Me too. I never should have made that deal. You were trying to protect yourself. I would have done the same thing. Nothing comes between us again. Ever again. My God, that could be the name of our next song. [LAUGHS] MAN: Jessica! Very impressive lawyering. Well, it was a team effort. How about a victory celebration? My treat, someplace great. Thanks, but you two go ahead. You sure? Yeah. Yeah, it's been a long week, and I just... I'm gonna head home. All right. Let's go. TINA: Everyone look out for our next record. We love our fans. Thank you. There she is. The woman who saved Confetti. [CHUCKLES] Actually, if it wasrt for you and your amazing poster, I never would have gotten the truth out of Tina. It was nothing. Just eyelash, glue, and glitter. So are we gonna go celebrate? Yes. I am going to take a long, hot bath. Oh. What? What's with the "oh"? Nothing. It's Friday night, and I know you had a long week but... We used to go out on Friday nights. You're tired, I get it. This is why I miss out on new bands like Confetti. It's okay, sweetie. I understand. So where would we go? Oh, nowhere in particular, unless somebody had two VIP tickets to the party at La Bella. So, what do you think? Are we going to La Bella tonight? I wouldn't miss it for the world. [CONFETTI'S "BEGIN AGAIN" PLAYING] [BOTH LAUGH] Success. [???]
