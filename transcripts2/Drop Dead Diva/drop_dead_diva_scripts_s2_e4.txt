 [???] JANE: See that aspiring model there? That was me, Deb, until the day I died. I thought I'd go straight to heaven, but there was a bit of a mix-up, and I woke up in someone else's body. So now I'm Jane, a super busy lawyer with my very own assistant. I got a new life, a new wardrobe. The only people who know what's going on with me are my girlfriend, Stacy and my guardian angel, Fred. I used to think everything happened for a reason. And, well, I sure hope I was right.

 [SAMBA MUSIC IN SPANISH PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS] You got moves. Apparently Jane knows how to samba. This body is full of surprises. Where have you been? Late night, early morning. Why are you home so early from work? Oh, my God. Chicken Marbella, carrot soup and sauteed cauliflower. The sex-is-in-the-air dinner? Ha-ha. Well, it was a late night for me too. And it was amazing. He was amazing. I was amazing. We were amazing.

 Tony? But I thought you guys were over. So did I. But we went up against each other in court. And I guess all of the arguing and pleading just spilled over into an action in personam. Oh, translation... You don't need to translate. This is like Cameron Diaz and Ashton Kutcher in What Happens in Vegas. They went at it and then they went at it. Today is the first day since I've been Jane that I didn't even think once: "Why did this happen to me?" I'm just happy. Mm. Tell me details. Like, did he spend the night? That was the only bummer. Oh. I know. He said he had an early morning. Hope I don't like him more than he likes me. Maybe he will sleep over tonight. How can I help? Um... You take Fred to the movies. Oh. And make it a double feature. [CHUCKLES] [???] I need to see Kaswell. May I ask what this is regarding? No, you may not. Is she in? I'm sorry. Care to leave a message? Tell her that I... No, say that... Just give her this. Did I just hear Parker? Yep. Sent him away. What? Why? I was not to disturb you under any conditions. Never send away a managing partner. Got it? Yes, ma'am. He brought you this. That was thoughtful. Kim, the new client's in the conference room. You still available to help me out? Let's go. My daughter Susie. She's 8. She plays after-school basketball in what's supposed to be an everybody plays league. Supposed to be? These leagues are supposed to be good for self-esteem and team building skills, but... But Susie's coach is a jackass. HELEN: He yells. He plays favorites. He is a volunteer, but you would think he was coaching the Lakers. Susie plays the same position as his daughter. And he is constantly benching her in favor of his own kid. And did you complain to the league? They don't wanna hear it. Not to mention he's on their board. I'm sorry. I'm confused. Are we suing to get Susie more playing time? I wish I had thought of that. Helers being sued. [CROWD CHEERING OVER TV] It's fourth quarter and Susie hadrt played all game. I got her off the bench and I demanded he let her play. He said the game was too important and called me a helicopter mom. You know, for hovering over my daughter. When he ordered her back to the bench, I guess I just snapped. Oh. [CHUCKLES] You... You clocked him. I've never hit anyone in my life. And to be honest, I really didn't think I hit him all that hard. He's suing for assault and battery. [SIGHS] And if he wins, he'll take everything we have. [???] It's true. I swear. The cauliflower is not a flower. I'm sorry. If cauliflower was a flower, there'd be cauliflower in that vase. People would exchange cauliflower bouquets. The rose lobby cornered romance market before the cauliflower lobby had a chance. When the cauliflower matures, the buds open into bright yellow flowers. You can look it up. Cauliflower. Cauliflower. Cauliflower. Cauliflower, from the Latin caulis floris, a noun, a group of tightly clustered flower buds. [CHUCKLES] Okay. You win. [CELL PHONE RINGS] Teri, I'm kind of in the middle of something. Can I call you...? What? [SIREN WAILING] Hey, boss. I am way too overdressed to be posting bail for you and... Edward, my cousin. I hope we didn't ruin your evening. It wasrt exactly what I had in mind. What happened? We were at a block party. And I got stopped for an open container. What am I, 19? You get fined for an open container. You don't get arrested. You do for unpaid parking tickets. How many? Enough to be arrested. And what about Edward? He came to my defense. I just told the cop it wasrt cool. TERl: He was polite but they arrested him for interfering with an officer. Give us a second. I don't care about me, but make Edward's arrest go away. I'll do what I can. His mother died when he was a kid and my mom raised him. He's like my little brother. First thing tomorrow morning, I will call the ADA and take care of it. Can you make it home okay? I have a important appointment. Say hi to Tony. [???] You really think I could fall asleep waiting for you? Oh. Well, you know, it's late, so I'd understand. I'm really glad you stayed. Oh, but just so you know, on Valentine's Day, I still want roses. You gonna just stand there, or what? Oh. Well, you know, it is my bed. Heh. Mm-hm. So... [???] Is that a toothbrush? Well, I don't mean to be presumptuous. But, uh... I thought I'd stay the night, if you don't mind. I don't mind. I don't mind at all. I've cleared your schedule for the day. What? Why? So you could focus on my situation. I spoke with the ADA. He's agreed to dismiss charges if you pay the tickets by the end of the week. Awesome. But I'm gonna need a loan. No problem. Edward can plead to a lesser charge. Disturbing the peace. [PHONE RINGING] Gonna get that? Jane Bingum's office. She's here, but she's really busy, Tony. Ooh. Give me the phone. I was just texting you. I had a great time last night. And this morning. It was perfect. And now you're officially my good-luck charm. What? You are speaking to the newest assistant U.S. Attorney. They finally called and I got the job. Oh, you did not. That's amazing! We are so celebrating tonight. Now, what does a U.S. Attorney eat, because I think that I... Excuse me, Tony. Teri? I'm anxious. I can't help it. I feel responsible for Edward. I just wanna be... You finish. Everything all right? It's fine. Listen. I better go, but congrats again, Mr. U.S. Attorney. Okay, bye. Bye. Ha-ha. I'm sorry, Jane. Are you sure that the judge will approve Edward's plea bargain? We are due in court at 3:00. Now, I will call you as soon as we know anything. Trust me, Teri. I know what I'm doing. David? You're Mr. Parker's assistant, right? Executive assistant. I'm Fred. I just started over at Kaswell's desk. You may know me as the new guy, or newbie or maybe the freshman. Heh-heh. None of the above. I should get back to my desk. Hey, listen. Um, ahem. Between you and me, um, assistant to assistant, uh, am I out of the loop? Is there something going on between your boss and my boss? Excuse me? It's just that your boss brought my boss coffee. And I felt this vibe. So, you know, if there's anything that I need to know... I don't know where you worked before. Nowhere you've heard of. But people in our positions don't gossip about our boss. [???] It was nice to meet you! You can see the damage to the second cervical vertebra. I'm sorry. I didn't know you were a doctor. JOE: Our expert, who is a doctor will testify that Jack's injury is consistent with an upward blow to his jaw. GRAYSON: He can testify all he wants. Helen was acting in self-defense. What? By definition, self-defense includes defense of others. Mr. Bryant engaged in a season-long campaign of emotional abuse against Susie. You gotta be kidding me. And Ms. Wakefield had no choice but to protect her child. [???] [TALKING INDISTINCTLY] Fred, what's he doing here? That is the basketball coach who's suing our client. Why? You know him? I used to date him. I mean, Deb did. Wow. It really is a small world. I gotta go. [IN UNISON] I've got big news. BOTH: Mine's bigger. Mine's about Grayson. You go first. Okay. [CLEARS THROAT] He's moving. What? Mm-hm. I drove by his house, your old house. And saw the for sale sign. But... But why? That was our house. That was the beginning of our life together. How could he sell it? Maybe it's just too much for him. Okay, now your turn. I ran into Aspen Jack. [GASPS] Who? Jack Bryant. The guy I dated before Grayson. Oh, yeah. He flew us to his house in Aspen for New Year's. He was cute. But there was a problem. He was married. Right. Yeah, a week after that trip, I found out that he had a wife and two kids. Remember? What a jerk. A jerk with a completely awesome ski house. I still have that picture of us in the hot tub. Oh, no. Oh, no? I have that picture too. I look hot in it. Yes, but, Stacy, it's in my scrapbook which is still in Graysors house, in a Gucci box behind the sweaters. If Graysors moving, he's gonna find it. It's a picture of you, of Deb, someone he loved. Exactly, and who wants a picture of someone they love with a married guy in a hot tub? You didn't know he was married. I'm not here to explain that to Grayson. So I have to get that scrapbook back. I'll take care of it, sweetie. But how? Remember where you used to keep your spare key? Yeah. Me too. [CHUCKLES] [???] Kaswell. Whoa. If anyone asks, it was not me who stuck a finger in Lorraine's birthday cake. We have to chat. Isn't that what we're doing? Our assistants are talking about us. Is there an us? Is this about drinks the other night? Your assistant asked my assistant why I brought you coffee. Totally inappropriate. I'll talk to him. Mm-hm. Hey. Why did you bring me coffee? Is that really what's important here? [???] KIM: Hey. What is wrong with you? I'm not sure how to answer that. You talked to David about me and Parker? What? No. I mean, yeah, but l... If I wanted an office gossip, I would've hired Teri. Listen, it wasrt gossip. I was acquiring information. At my last job, I was the guy that knew everything. I saw Mr. Parker bring you a cup of coffee. Which seems out of the ordinary. And I inquired... Look. Colleagues who work together in a professional capacity sometimes bring each other coffee. That's it. Are we clear? Yes, ma'am. [???] TERl: Edward! I know you said you'd call, but I just couldn't wait anymore. Well, do you wanna tell her or should I? She was amazing! [LAUGHS] The judge agreed to reduce to a misdemeanor. No jail time. Thank you, thank you, thank you. I'm sorry I've been such a pain. No, you were more like a dull ache. Jane, I owe you, big time. It was nothing. See, I have all this legal knowledge in my head. And I just put it to use. Edward Kim? Yes. Immigration enforcement. The court informed us of your plea. Come with us. I don't understand. No! Excuse me, I am his lawyer. Can you please just slow down for a second? What's going on? It's a notice of removal. They wanna deport you. You can't. He's a U.S. Citizen. Not according to our database. This way, Mr. Kim. Sir. Ma'am, you need to remove your hand. [???] Okay, but there's just clearly been a mistake. Mr. Kim. Jane, do something, please! EDWARD: It makes no sense. When you pled guilty, the court automatically alerted immigration. They've classified you as an immediate deportable. You told him to take the deal. There'd be no jail time. But I didn't know he wasrt a citizen. But I am a citizen. I have a social security number, a license. A library card. According to the government, you came on a tourist visa as an infant and never left. But his father was an American GI stationed in South Korea. Where's your father now? He was killed in an accident on base before I was born. That's when they came to live with me. Then there has been a mistake. So we will get the right paperwork in front of immigration. And then I can go home? Yes, Edward, I promise. [???] Teri! Teri! Hey. This is all my fault. What are you talking about? When he confronted the police, it was because of me. He was just defending you. I goaded him into it. He was standing there, scared. And I told him to do something. If I kept my mouth shut, none of this would be happening. Teri, it's gonna be okay. Oh. Under the doctrine of jus sanguinis, the child of a U.S. Citizen is entitled to citizenship. So we just prove his father's lineage and all of this will be over, okay? [???] We have to stop meeting like this. [CHUCKLES] What is it now, Fred? Gonna tell me about the paralegal who steals staples? That Marcy in accounting slips vodka into her tea? No, no, no. None of that. Marcy? Really? Listen, I'm not an office gossip. I wouldn't want you to think Kim would hire someone who isn't discreet. She ripped you a new one? She's got a gift. Well, I didn't mean to get you in trouble. No, it's okay. At my last job, I dealt with life and death, so I totally get it. Um, ahem. I brought you this as a peace offering. You brought me a coffee? I was picking up Kim's mid-afternoon double soy latte, and I figured... Thanks, Fred. Heh. Hey, you know, we should grab lunch sometime. I'm free tomorrow. I'll make sandwiches. [???] I've had persistent pain and I've had to cut back at work. And outside of work? Physical therapy, three times a week. He's throwing a pity party and inviting the jury. No more questions. Isn't it true that Susie Wakefield played two minutes a game and was regularly replaced by your own daughter? When I'm on the court, I'm not the father to one girl. I'm a coach for a whole team. I'll take that as a yes. During the season, did Susie repeatedly ask for more playing time? Everyone wants more time on the court. At one point, did you tell her to buck up and stop whining? I was trying to motivate her, toughen her up. KIM: Mr. Bryant, this is a copy of your league's mission statement. Can you read the highlighted portion? [CLEARS THROAT] "At Western Valley Sports, we believe that every child deserves equal time on the court, regardless of athletic ability." Did your plan to toughen up an 8-year-old supersede the mission statement? I don't know how to answer that question. You just did. I know you're disappointed, Umma. I shouldn't have taken Edward to that party. Is that all you have to say? Jane's a great lawyer. She's gonna fix everything. I've heard a lot about you over the years, Mrs. Lee. Teri talks very highly... Edward's only locked up because of a clerical error. Once we sort out his immigration status, we'll get him out. Thank you, Jane. We just need to identify his father. I've never met him. We were already living in California when Edward was conceived. Maybe you have a birth certificate or military enlistment papers? No, I have nothing. Umma, there's that old photo of Edward's father in his bedroom. It's just a photo. Oh, that might help. Well, I'll be right back. [SIGHS] Are you all right? Do you see how angry she is? No. Trust me, quiet and calm is far worse than yelling and screaming. When I was 10, I burned down the garage. She went silent for a week. Don't ask. Here you go. Thank you. Oh, that's great. I can see his name and rank. We'll be able to identify him from this. Thank you. Tell Edward I'm making his favorite dinner. It will be ready when he comes home. [???] Susie, why did you wanna play on a basketball team? Because of my friends. We used to play every day at recess. It was fun. Then we all joined the league together. Do you still play basketball at recess? No. Why? I don't know. It's okay, Susie. You can tell me. The coach told me that I sucked in front of all my friends. Now, if I play, I get picked last and no one passes me the ball. I wouldn't want me on my team. Susie, when I was about your age, I had a coach who told me I wasrt any good. [???] He made me feel real bad about myself. But you know what? I didn't let that stop me. And in college, I made the team. Sometimes it's the coach that sucks. Susie. You were standing next to your mother when she hit Coach Jack, right? Yeah. Did Coach Jack threaten her? No. Did he threaten you? No. When you tell your mom you're having problems with another kid at school, does she tell you to solve that problem by hitting? Of course not. What does she say? To use my words. That's good advice. [SIGHS] [DOOR OPENING] [YELLS] [SCREAMS] Stacy? What are you doing here? Ahem. Well, this is gonna sound crazy, but I had a dream about Deb. Anyway, she was trying to tell me something so I had to come right over to your house to try and communicate with her. Sometimes, it's just really hard and I miss her. I understand. And I would've called if I thought you were home, but... Why are you home, anyways? I'm meeting with my realtor. You're selling? I think I need a fresh start somewhere else. Boy, I'm gonna miss this place. Deb and I doing cardio on the stairs, practicing our turns before our auditions, throwing ragers while you were out of town. Wait, never mind. Well, time marches on. What's that? Um... So while I was trying to communicate with Deb, I found a pair of Gucci black Prato flat rainboots, European size 39 that I lent her. So it's okay if I take them back, right? Of course. They're yours. Thanks. Gotta go. [???] [???] [KNOCK ON DOOR] Come in. Oh, Bingum. It's nice to see you too. I thought you were someone else. Someone you're trying to entice with a new cologne? It's spicy. How can I help you? I was wondering what's going on with Grayson and Kim's case. Why are you interested? Well, as an aspiring partner, I should educate myself on all the firm's business, right? I like the fire, but their case is down the drain. Our client cold-cocked a sympathetic plaintiff. The guy's a slime ball. From what I hear. According to Kim, jury thinks he's good. No, he's an awful guy. The kind of guy who takes off his wedding ring at the gym and picks up a girl during Pilates. I'm just saying. Yeah, well, why don't you share your insights with Grayson? I've got stuff to do. Oh, right, the new cologne. It's growing on me. Bingum, let me ask you something. You ever find yourself in a situation where you work with someone and then you realize feelings for that person have developed? And keeping it to yourself is maybe the hardest thing you've ever done? No. Yeah, me either. [???] Is it Cynthia in accounting? Good night, Bingum. I wanted to do something nice to celebrate your job but I was just so busy with Teri's case. How's she doing? Mm. Well, she strong-armed a veteran into keeping the VA Archives open late. That sounds like Teri. Yeah. You don't like mushrooms? I'm sorry. I totally should have asked. No, no... The pizza's fine. But, um, there is something I need to tell you. Is it bad? [SIGHS] It's bad, isn't it? My new job. I just found out, uh, DOJ is placing me in Washington, D.C. And they want me there by the end of the week. Oh, you're moving across country? Uh... Well, that's great. It could be. How? If you come with me. [???] Things were finally coming together for us. He brought his toothbrush. And there was cauliflower. It felt right. It is right, sweetie. He asked you to go with him. When you were Deb, you'd have said yes. Yeah, but Deb didn't have a job that she would be leaving behind. Deb was a hard-working model. Just like me. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to insult you. Or me. Apology accepted. And for the record, if you move, I would miss you so much, I don't know what I would do. I don't wanna think about that. Yay avoidance! Let's look at pictures. Okay. My scrapbook. Wow. Uh... It feels like it's someone else's life. I found the pictures. Ah. There he is. The married guy. Again, I didn't realize he was married. It could have happened to any of us. Jack the jerk. He looks so smug. You're hiding a wife and kids, mister. Remember the next day, he went skiing and he collided with a snowboarder. Talk about karma. We had to rush him to the emergency room. Which explains that. My God, he sprained his neck in Aspen. It sounds like a country song. He sprained his neck in Aspen. Ah. That's good for the chorus, but we need verses. Like what rhymes with Aspen? Stacy, Jack is suing Graysors client because of a neck injury. What if it really happened in Aspen? Oh, my God, you dating a married guy could be the best thing that's ever happened to Grayson! That didn't come out right. [???] You ready to discuss our closing? What? Did you put this on my desk? I've never seen it before. Aspen, 2006. [???] If this is for real then... Maybe Helen isn't the proximate cause of Jack's neck injury. I'll fax a subpoena to the medical center in Aspen. But, Grayson, where did that come from? A guy like Jack makes enemies. Maybe someone's getting even. FRED: No way. Ha-ha-ha. Fred, have you seen Teri? Dude, I am going to own that place. Yeah. All right. Thanks again for the invite. Okay. Goodbye. Ah... Can I help you? Who were you talking to? Only my new best friend. Who's your best friend? David. From the office. As in Parker's assistant? Yep. We had a misunderstanding so I brought him coffee, we had lunch, totally hit it off. Long story short, he invited me to karaoke. Fred, you know David's gay, right? No, he isn't. Yes. He is. He doesn't look gay. You can't tell anything from looking at someone. I mean, do I look like a 25-year-old blonde model? Wait, is that a trick question? It's great you have a new friend. David's awesome. But coffee, lunch, karaoke? Make sure you're not leading him on. Social cues aren't your thing. He calls me "dude" and he has season tickets to the Kings. Ever since Gretzky retired, hockey in L.A. Might as well be the Ice Capades. I gotta go. [???] As an infant, Edward Kim entered this country on a six-month visa. At no time did he seek permanent resident status. As such, he should be removed from this country immediately. Ms. Bingum. Hmm? Um... Cutting it close. Where is the documentation? I've got nothing. There is no paperwork, Jane. What? JUDGE: Ms. Bingum? Your Honor, one moment, please. The photo was from an old Army recruitment ad. The whole story was a lie. We need to talk to your mother. Why isn't she here? Counselor, last chance. Your Honor, in light of new information, we request a recess. And I'll need 48 hours. You've got 20 minutes. My father's a recruitment poster? What's that make me? You're the same person you were yesterday. Circumstances change. You don't. Circumstances are about to get me deported. What'd Umma say? Is she coming? She didn't answer. Call her in five minutes. Then every five minutes after that. She needs to be here. What for? To confirm that my life is a lie? They're about to send me to South Korea. My family, my friends, my life. It's all here. Edward, I need you to testify. What am I supposed to say? Tell the court about your aunt and cousin. They raised me. Birthdays, Christmas, graduations. You celebrate with them? Yes. They're my family. My only family. Objection. It's obvious what counsel's trying to do here. "Family Hardship claims" are limited to immediate family. Not aunts, not cousins. Edward, what do you call your aunt? Umma. Which means? It's Korean for mother. And your cousin Teri? Nuna. It means older sister. Your Honor, if you deport Edward, the hardship to his family will be indistinguishable from that of any mother and sister. Yes, he was born in South Korea. But he has no memories from that country. He has lived here his entire life. [???] Your argument is compelling. But current law gives me little discretion. Your petition is denied. Mr. Kim will return to South Korea on the next available flight. Oh, God. Mrs. Lee, you need to talk to me. I know why you werert in court. Where's Teri? She's at the office desperately searching for a way to keep Edward in the country. I see. You knew the story about Edward's father was a lie. This is a family matter. Do you know what I love about your daughter? She speaks up. And she's not afraid of anything. And I think she got that from you. Edward is about to be sent away forever. And I know you love him like a son. So help me understand. I promised my sister I would never tell Edward about his real father. Why? Because... Because Edward's father was not an American soldier. He was a North Korean border guard. North Korean? My sister was 16. She got pregnant, he left her, she hid it as long as she could from my parents. But eventually Edward was born. They were so ashamed. A child out of wedlock with an absent North Korean father. They gave her a choice. Give him up or go away. And that's when they came here. My sister had one wish, that Edward not be defined by the circumstances of his birth. I promised to keep that secret, no matter what. Mrs. Lee, I know it's painful, but if you allow me to tell the truth, there's a chance that I can keep Edward in this country. Now wouldn't your sister have wanted that? That's the x-ray you provided before the trial. And this one is identical. Get to the point. This x-ray was taken at the Aspen Medical Center four years ago. It's the same neck sprain. We've got the doctor who will say so. Helen Wakefield didn't injure your neck, just your pride. You tried to use this situation to try to steal money from a single mom and child. Judges frown on lawyers who withhold evidence during discovery. I had no idea. One play left to call, coach. Drop the case, pay Helers legal fees, and resign from the league. Oh, one more thing. Actually, I understand there's an end of the season banquet. That'd be a perfect forum for your public apology. [???] [ELEVATOR BELL DINGS] [???] Hey, uh, David, you got...? You got a minute? You're chickening out of karaoke? What? No, no... Uh... Well, maybe. Um... Listen, I like you. And I don't have any other guy friends. But I don't want to lead you on. "Lead me on"? You know I'm not gay, right? Fred, look at my ring. I've been with my partner for eight years. So you're not leading me on. Besides, I know you're not gay. Wait, how do you know that? You can't tell anything by looking at someone. You're absolutely right. So can I still come to karaoke? Yeah. Just don't go singing "It's Raining Men." You won't pull it off. [???] Your Honor, I thought I missed you. What are you doing here? The case is over. Edward Kim is on a military helicopter on his way... To San Francisco, where he'll be deported. But he's still in American airspace, which means you still have jurisdiction. And I have a new claim. Asylum. Asylum? How do you figure? Turns out, my client is North Korean by virtue of his father's nationality. That is a copy of a Family Registration Certificate from the consulate. It confirms that Edward's father is from... North Korea. The U.S. Has a long-standing policy of granting asylum to people from North Korea, a country where he's guaranteed to face political persecution. You said the law didn't grant you discretion. But isn't this enough? One phone call and you can change the course of this mars life. And then the judge ordered the helicopter to turn around. I mean, a couple more hours... I don't even wanna think about it. You pulled it off. He was lucky to have you. [STARS' "UNDERTOW" PLAYING] Um, Tony. Yes, Jane. I love what we have together. And I love that you asked me to go with you. But... But your life is here. And it was selfish of me to ask you to move. No, it was amazing that you asked. And if I were in a different place in my life... But I can't go with you. It was a long shot, I know. So, what do we do now? We hug. For a really long time. And then you leave first, and I order another drink. Yeah. [SIGHS] [CROWD APPLAUDING AND CHATTERING] DAVID: Uh-huh. [LAUGHS] I love karaoke. And all your friends are so nice and clean. Hey, Fred, you're up. Go, Fred, Go! [CROWD CHATTERING] [SINGING "BAB Y, I NEED YOUR LOVING"] GRAYSON: Jane? Hey. Grayson. Hi! Mind if l...? No. Well, what brings you here? [SIGHS] I had to get out of the house. Boxes everywhere. Right. You're selling. Actually I decided not to. Hmm. I just called the realtor. Truth is, no matter where I am, Deb's with me. I'm an idiot to think I'll stop missing her if I sell that house. Well, you know that you don't have to move away from old memories to create new ones. Yeah, exactly. [CHUCKLES] [???]
